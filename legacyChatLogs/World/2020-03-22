 HuyCuto: this game is eazy
 tutubalin: Waffle3z I also track it. One usefull thing is to decide should you use Silence and Torpedo. If opponent doesn't know well where you are, using Silence is not required and using Torpedo will reveal you.
 eulerscheZahl: Hjax 04:05AMcaptain levine seems to blow himself up 
 eulerscheZahl: still a bit too strong
 Waffle3z: wood boss is pretty good in bronze, wonder where it would place
 Waffle3z: it knows how to use mines
 eulerscheZahl: i know, i coded that part of the boss :D
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i could submit the default AI in bronze
 eulerscheZahl: ok, let's seesubmitted
 Waffle3z: you copied it into your bot?
 eulerscheZahl: i replaced my bot by the boss
 eulerscheZahl: @ Lachrymosa wondering why the boss "knows" where you are: the boss has a list of possible positino of yours and targets the first valid one. you start in the corner and stay at the edge, so that heuristic is 100% correct in your case :D
 eulerscheZahl: actually the spawn in the corner is enough
 MSmits: crap i skipped wood 1
 MSmits: never got to code silence and sonar&#160;:(
 Waffle3z: you get to skip straight into mines
 MSmits: this is what I get for coding too good a wood 2 bot. 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441282675">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441282675</a>
 MSmits: Euler why do i wake up to the sound of you blowing yourself up :P
 eulerscheZahl: because i replaced my bot by the default AI to see how it ranks
 eulerscheZahl: read 10 messages above
 MSmits: ahhhh
 MSmits: well i just woke up :P
 eulerscheZahl: you are early
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: so am i
 MSmits: you're just you
 MSmits: isnt this your normal time
 eulerscheZahl: the early toad catches the fly
 MSmits: true
 Waffle3z: looks like 75th
 MSmits: is the default AI the boss code?
 eulerscheZahl: not that good at all
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Waffle3z: so better than 11 others in bronze
 eulerscheZahl: bot with higher league rules
 eulerscheZahl: so it places mines now
 MSmits: ah I see
 eulerscheZahl: which the wood bosses couldn't
 MSmits: I woke up knowing how to code bitboards for silence, but I need to work on my i-sec homework first&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: what's it about?
 MSmits: I have to do a ddos attack. DNS reflection
 MSmits: amplification and such
 MSmits: if the server gets slow later, you know why
 MSmits: jk, it's a mininet simulation :P

 dbdr: KostyantynSushchyk: Last submit3/21/20 4:32 PM
 dbdr: 92%
 dbdr: in submit for 16 hours&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: hm, that's not supposed to happen
 eulerscheZahl: game 24 is stuck
 eulerscheZahl: when you open the last battles
 dbdr: what's the best way to report such issues?
 dbdr: I think other people reported issues with stuck submits
 eulerscheZahl: discord staff ping or forumprobably forum if it's not too urgent and affecting everyone
 eulerscheZahl: i guess a reca condition
 dbdr: recar condition :D
 eulerscheZahl: A gets match vs B, but B submits at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: and no match for A then
 eulerscheZahl: race condition*
 eulerscheZahl: my fingers don't always type what the voice in my head tells them
 dbdr: yeah, sth like that. or a timeout that's not detected for some reason
 dbdr: TIL eulerscheZahl hears voices in his head&#160;;)
 dbdr: the problem is my recorder waits for a started submit to finish to avoid the noise of partial submits
 dbdr: domino effect of failing systems
 eulerscheZahl: your design choice is questionable in hindsight
 eulerscheZahl: there was another site by adrien that indexes more often and allows to filter pending
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/">https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/</a>
 dbdr: submits are not supposed to last 16 hours...
 eulerscheZahl: wrong
 dbdr: so in his system a person in pending submit is either recorded wrongly, or ignored for that time
 dbdr: they are supposed to? a single submit?
 eulerscheZahl: check the lederboard if you don't believe me
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 dbdr: I think it's better to record a correct ranking for everyone each time
 dbdr: I don't require there to be no pending at the same time
 dbdr: I track each player separately
 eulerscheZahl: true, some stronger users with a pending submit can be ranked below me temporarily
 eulerscheZahl: making my ranking on your snapshot wrong as well
 dbdr: so my system is guaranteed to finish in the time for a single submit to finish
 dbdr: e.g. say 30 minutes max. in bad cases
 eulerscheZahl: and if a player spams submits and never waits for one run to finish?
 dbdr: I would need to check. yes maybe that would break it
 dbdr: if someone submits permanently
 dbdr: and does not go to sleep, or scripts it&#160;;)
 dbdr: but I would count that as malice
 dbdr: I guess in such case they would deserve to be ignored
 dbdr: and their agentIDs to be made public
 eulerscheZahl: sinan submitted a lot at code of ice and fire
 dbdr: a lot is fine if it's not 24/24 without a single one finishing, as far as that tool is concerned

 Nixerrr: Loving the visuals :heart_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: not much to see yet, wrote that in 10min :D
 Nixerrr: I mean it's nice to see the algo in action
 eulerscheZahl: but i got my replay downloader running, as a single board state isn't enough for my full history of opponent actions
 eulerscheZahl: that makes it easier to reproduce offline

 AntiSquid: dbdr new avatar? :o
 dbdr: still PoP
 dbdr: just by the ocean
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN get a robot drowning in the sea avatar
 AutomatonNN: what is the main problem?
 Nixerrr: So the automatons are still around :rolling_eyes:
 AntiSquid: well hm a month long contest, maybe i will change mine too to some ocean related stuff, if the lockdown finishes this year i might be able to have some holidays at the sea&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: are you doing the contest Nixerrr
 Nixerrr: Yup
 eulerscheZahl: no sleep till legend
 Nixerrr: Exactly
 Nixerrr: Can't go to the gym and might be made redundant soonish
 Nixerrr: So got time on my hands
 AntiSquid: kinda horrible situation
 AntiSquid: lucky to still be working from home at least
 dbdr: Nixerrr what's your job?
 Nixerrr: I work in social media but one of the main clients of the agency is an oil giant. And they are about to introduce serious budget cuts and might drop our agency
 dbdr: and oil prices just tanked
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, the entire marketing budget is usually the first one to get cut
 Nixerrr: At least I don't need to worry about my mortgage until the end of the year :D
 ThunderbirdOne: oh?
 eulerscheZahl: did they pay in advance?
 Nixerrr: Mortgages are being frozen till the end off 2020
 ThunderbirdOne: nice
 Nixerrr: *end of
 ThunderbirdOne: I feel like software and IT is one of the few industries where the impact of the virus is rather small
 Nixerrr: Depends I guess and a lot of companies are definitely benefiting from it
 ThunderbirdOne: there are always companies benefitting from shitty situations :p
 Nixerrr: True
 eulerscheZahl: like car insuranceswhen you stay at home, you can't have an accident
 Marchete: original prince of persia was never on the sea
 dbdr: that's PoP 2
 dbdr: yes, was  strrange, first time outdoors even
 Marchete: I played a lot the original, a very nice game
 dbdr: same
 Marchete: I don't remember that 2nd part :D
 dbdr: obviously&#160;:)
 dbdr: played the 1st more as well
 Marchete: when you fight against yourself, clever ideas
 Marchete: all in 64KB :D
 dbdr: yeah, and awesome animations for the hardware
 eulerscheZahl: i managed to fight vs Jaffar in part 1but then ran out of time
 eulerscheZahl: i sucked at that game
 emh: the sonar result is from previous turn right? so if opponent moves from zone 1 to zone 2 right after the turn you scan you will get Y in zone 1 and opponent will be in zone 2 on that turn?
 eulerscheZahl: read the statement
 Schneewittchen: yap
 eulerscheZahl: This is in respect to the time of issuing the command, not after the opponent moved.
 emh: yes I read it
 emh: but was still not quite sure
 eulerscheZahl: i thought i was accurate enough :cry:
 pb4: You were
 emh: maybe my natural language parsing skills are not up to par hehe
 AntiSquid: make POP multi dbdr
 AntiSquid: you have few months time now
 dbdr: I thought about it. or optim
 yfprojects: Do you guys keep track of how much information the opponent has about your position?
 eulerscheZahl: the fighting part?or the jumping around?
 dbdr: still contest in may no?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: so not much free time...
 eulerscheZahl: yfprojects i don't but i should
 dbdr: not defined yet
 AntiSquid: i think a jumping around game like mario or POP for opti section would be nice
 dbdr: the concept is as advanced as "a PoP themed CG-something would be nice"
 AntiSquid: sort of like speed running
 eulerscheZahl: as a side scroller?
 AntiSquid: whichever
 yfprojects: @eulerscheZahl But that doubles the amount of information processing
 dbdr: real PoP is side scroller, no? or platform? not sure about the terminology
 AntiSquid: can be all on one screen too
 dbdr: rooms can be thought as levels
 AntiSquid: see mario maker for crazy ideas
 dbdr: might be interesting, a multi where each league uses a different room. probably not recommended
 eulerscheZahl: i know yfprojectsalready timing out when i replace torpedoes by mines&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: pow(2,CSB)
 AntiSquid: well you can also have random maps, like kutulu 
 AntiSquid: like bender 4 *
 Marchete: I'd say platform
 Marchete: if I recall PoP haven't scrool
 Marchete: scroll
 eulerscheZahl: PoP has different rooms
 eulerscheZahl: no scrolling
 Illedan: Hi
 dbdr: hey
 dbdr: small idea: would be helpful if the sonar animation had a different color based on who is doing it

 dandrian: hey, torpedo range 4 means it can reach within 9x9 rectangle with you  in center? Or it can just travel 4 cells?
 Schneewittchen: On a free map it would be manhatten dist
 Schneewittchen: So at max 2 diagonal
 dandrian: Thanks
 tonowak: torpedo range 4 is measured in floodfill / bfs distance
 tonowak: right?
 inoryy: so... expectimax or mcts?&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: if forest
 darkhorse64: with bfs flowers
 inoryy: nice
 ThunderbirdOne: yup, same here
 AntiSquid: about 500 submits for 2000 registered folks
 AntiSquid: and it came out yesterday :thinking:
 emh: 56 submits are mine hehe. so I have &gt;10% of submits?
 AntiSquid: you have 56 alts?
 emh: no just submitted 56 times
 AntiSquid: ok i meant 500 bots on the leaderboard
 emh: ah I see
 ThunderbirdOne: so far i only submitted;.. twice?
 TomerBG: How do you calc which sector the cell is on?

 ThunderbirdOne: lol
 RanN42: can someone help me with just the idea of how can i do this - loop over each possible path from my x and y, to a x and y that is 4 or less cells away from me?
 ThunderbirdOne: you can actually do this with a nested for loop
 darkhorse64: 3 submits for now. Did not try very hard. Boss is quite hard. I thought I could get by for Wood2 with improved motion but actually the boss is tracking you. So, I am writing tracking code and I'll fire torpedoes
 RanN42: i mean loop over every possible x and y that is 4 cells away
 inoryy: RanN42 build a distance matrix  on first turn with something like floyd-warshall
 inoryy: game grid is static
 ThunderbirdOne: you can just start a nested for loop... starting at x-4, y-4... and go to x + 4, y + 4
 RanN42: ok let me google it :joy:
 ThunderbirdOne: use manhattan distance + island map to skip useless coordinates
 darkhorse64: Learn breadth first search. Redblobgames.com
 RanN42: ok thanks 
 Rd211: quick question doesnt the second have an advantage over the first player?
 Rd211: second player*
 Rd211: i mean you could like dont move during the first round and thus make it even i guess
 dandrian: how can you not move?
 Schneewittchen: SILENCE N 0 for example
 eulerscheZahl: or any other action that isn't MOVE
 eulerscheZahl: shooting a torpedo, triggering a mine, ...
 AntiSquid: no wonder the contest is a month long
 inoryy: shooting a torpedo will give info
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 eulerscheZahl: even a mine placement can (no island in that direction)
 Rd211: well if i dont move i lose one point each time i dont move
 AntiSquid: they can't get any info if the bot crashes&#160;:)
 inoryy: only way to win
 dandrian: oh, I thought move action is mandatory
 Rd211: because i am on a square i have been on
 leojean890: move action is not mandatory but is useful because enables to load powers;)
 Rd211: if you dont move you lose one point actually
 dandrian: what if opponent is trying to shoot outside torpedo range? will I still receive coordinates it's shooting at?
 Rd211: because you like surface i guess
 MindControler: I can move and silence and the same turn right?
 yfprojects: yes
 yfprojects: @dandrian Its not intended but there was a bug
 MindControler: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441338488">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441338488</a>
 yfprojects: @Rd211 You are wrong.
 MindControler: Why do i die?
 MindControler: @dandrian u shouldnt receive it
 yfprojects: its a bug I think. There is an error in the referee
 MindControler: I mean i shouldnt crash
 MindControler: Right?
 MindControler: 0 cells to island = not moving?
 yfprojects: Ask eulerscheZahl or Illedan.
 AntiSquid: uhm wtf there are too few games for wood ...
 yfprojects: @MindControler What do you output in the last turn?
 MindControler: SILENCE 0 N
 MindControler: This kills me
 yfprojects: SILENCE N 0 is right
 yfprojects: Its the other way around
 Illedan: Yes
 MindControler: Oh yea wait
 MindControler: No
 MindControler: This is my output: MSG 2(1) | MOVE N SILENCE | SILENCE 0 N
 MindControler: First i move N because i can
 Illedan: Which is wrong
 Illedan: MOVE N SILENCE|SILENCE N 0
 yfprojects: Which is both wrong
 MindControler: Illedan if i do silence 0 i cant crash to island, right?
 Illedan: You crash because you send an invalid command
 MindControler: But the silence command is invalid
 yfprojects: Both is invalid I think
 MindControler: Nope
 MindControler: If i comment silence stuff i live
 Illedan: Because you wrote it wrong.
 Illedan: It needs to have direction first
 Illedan: then distance
 MindControler: Oh
 MindControler: My bad
 yfprojects: Its  SILENCE N 0
 MindControler: Thanks
 Illedan: ....
 Uljahn: also no spaces around |
 MindControler: It works Uljahn
 MindControler: It looks nicer to me
 Illedan: Yeah, values are trimmed Uljahn
 Uljahn: aah indeed

 AntiSquid: too few games in bloody wood .
 eulerscheZahl: nerf the boss, then wood will become smaller!
 emh: hmm still have bugs in enemy tracking.. sometimes getting 0 possible positions left. I just clear opponent orders then and start over hehe
 eulerscheZahl: i had that a lot as well
 dbdr: that's a cheap way to test
 eulerscheZahl: but getting optimistic that it's right now
 dbdr: do you handle mines eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: explosions, not placements
 dbdr: the two are linked, no?
 eulerscheZahl: so i don't clean up on old positions
 eulerscheZahl: mine explosions deal damage
 eulerscheZahl: or not, depending on the opponent location
 dbdr: ah, those that deal damage only?
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't say "it exploded there, enemy was there in the past"
 dbdr: right, that's the hard part I think
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AntiSquid: it won't become smaller if you don't have enough games to even reach the boss

 Illedan: You keep all paths?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Illedan: I  should start doing that too. To try and track mines
 Schneewittchen: Keep them as Bitsets of coverage not the actual paths
 eulerscheZahl: check my debug message: paths, current cells
 Illedan: aha
 eulerscheZahl: that's only a constant improvement
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if performance tuning alone helps here
 Schneewittchen: You dont want to know there paths but their covered area
 eulerscheZahl: for mine placements i want to know the path

 emh: welcome to Bronze MSmits. saw you in Last Battles. been here long?&#160;:)
 PYB: hello
 PYB: so in the challenges where we have to write code in as few chars as possible.... the C guys have no chance
 MadKnight: yea
 MadKnight: unless everyone writes in C
 MadKnight: or if u're in a clash alone
 MadKnight: can u start a clash alone, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you can just have an array of ints
 MadKnight: will u win because u will be first or will u lose because u're the last one&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there are worse golfing languages than C
 Automaton2000: thought it was a bug
 maras: Can I hit myself with my torpedo in the Ocean of Code?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MadKnight: probably
 emh: you can also do rocket jump to get the quad damage
 Illedan: egaetan, this if spagetti should be fairly easy to beat once someone tries to search a little bit&#160;:)
 egaetan: Some of us will
 egaetan: between kids and work from home
 emh: damnit.. why buggy code is always better than new code in contests :p
 eulerscheZahl: tell your kids to do your work, 2 problems solved at once
 egaetan: eulerscheZahl i should try
 egaetan: i hope they wont have to deal with Jira
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 inoryy: kids unfair advantage confirmed
 eulerscheZahl: do you have time (and motivation) for the contest inoryy?
 eulerscheZahl: i know that you started your new job recently
 eulerscheZahl: but corona changes a lot of statements on time schedules
 ZarthaxX: yes it does :P
 ZarthaxX: no uni till april 13th , amazing times
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: do you have to stay at home too ZarthaxX?
 inoryy: eulerscheZahl contest looks fun (gj!), I'll try to tinker every now and then, but my work schedule is basically unchanged by WFH

 a76a44: Hi guys,What does "not visiting already visited cells or islands" mean for the SILENCE instruction&#160;?
 wlesavo: damn, almost got to wood 1 on first submit
 eulerscheZahl: a76a44 basically the same limitation as for MOVEs
 eulerscheZahl: don't move on or through islands
 eulerscheZahl: and don't intersect with your own path
 pb4: Just for the sake of ease of parsing, is it possible to add spaces around the pipe character&#160;?
 Illedan: yes
 inoryy: but when do I get to visit an island
 pb4: TORPEDO 1 1|MOVE N
 Illedan: It is trimmed
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean your output or the referee input pb4?
 pb4: I mean in the things we receive from the referee
 eulerscheZahl: that would possibly break existing bots of other contestants
 pb4: Not a big deal if you don't want though&#160;:)
 Illedan: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, nope
 Illedan: Too breaking :P
 pb4: Ok
 pb4: damn
 Illedan: I guess you can add it yourself?
 inoryy: should've been semicolon
 Illedan: string.replace("|", " | ")
 eulerscheZahl: string parsing in C++ is no funeven less in C
 pb4: I'll need to find a way to do it properly
 emh: can you torpedo and throw mine and trigger mine at same turn? for 4 dmg?
 pb4: I like that Illedan&#160;!
 pb4: thanks  :)
 Illedan: No emh
 Illedan: You can't trigger a mine placed this round
 emh: oh ok
 Illedan: We dissalowed it for that reason :P
 eulerscheZahl: but you can trigger and old mine and torpedo at the same time
 Illedan: As you can save all stats, then suddenly do 4 damage and silence away
 emh: yes I saw that in a game
 emh: torpedo + old mine i mean
 Illedan: yeah, that works
 dbdr: critical hit
 pb4: @Illedan  : string.replace doesn't work that way&#160;:'(
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl you have to stay at home?
 dbdr: pb4, you can write very top bots but not parse a string?
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan doesn't know C++ very well
 eulerscheZahl: i'm allowed to leave my house for basic needs ZarthaxXbuying food, going for a walk alone, going to work
 ZarthaxX: we are allowed for the food thing
 eulerscheZahl: meeting with friends is strictly forbidden here and will cost a massive fine
 dbdr: oh, you go to work?
 inoryy: wait what you're not working from home, eulerscheZahl?
 dbdr: why not work from home?
 ZarthaxX: i see
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: looks this way... Let's see if I can still write top bots xD
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure about the work part
 eulerscheZahl: lockdown happened on friday evening here in bavaria
 dbdr: pb4 I don't doubt it&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: dbdr your profile pics looks very similar, what game is that
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even have a regulation for germany as a total
 dbdr: Prince of Persia 2
 inoryy: ZarthaxX the youngster
 ZarthaxX: thanks inoryy
 Azkellas: Can't you use std::getline with '|' as a delimiter pb4?
 emh: nice submit. first 13 battles wins. then euler hehe
 ZarthaxX: wait, you called me youngster&#160;? :thinking:
 inoryy: haha yes :D
 eulerscheZahl: and i didn't timeout vs you emh? amazing!
 pb4: Azkellas&#160;: that's what I'm looking at at the moment, but I need both space and | as delimiters
 dbdr: maybe he was too old to play at that time?&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: lol :rofl:
 pb4: guess it's going to be a two-step read then...
 ZarthaxX: that's another option yeah
 ZarthaxX: googled the youngster and was like this is not a game lol
 emh: euler hehe
 inoryy: rofl
 eulerscheZahl: i got several timeouts in my last submit
 eulerscheZahl: SILENCE gives me headache
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl is the situation in your place bad or not many cases&#160;?
 emh: I'm armed against timeouts with stopwatch now
 emh: just clearing the opponent directives on timeout
 eulerscheZahl: no idea ZarthaxXi don't follow the media
 ZarthaxX: aight :P
 Azkellas: first delimits by '|' to get actions, then by ' ' to parse them (I haven't tried ooc yet, might be wrong)
 eulerscheZahl: call me a jerk, i don't care too much atm
 ZarthaxX: as long as you dont ruin it it's ok..
 inoryy: not the best situation to be indifferent about, it's not politics..
 ZarthaxX: yeah global concern, it's scary
 eulerscheZahl: regarding politics i have an opinion
 pb4: how does getline behave when there is no | character&#160;? it stops at the first of "end of file or |"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more scared by global warming and such, than corona
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/VKwdnE.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/VKwdnE.jpg</a>you won't spread covid19 that way
 AntiSquid: i just look at this regarding cases:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9soBsFM3rAI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9soBsFM3rAI</a>
 inoryy: eulerscheZahl see if you were to follow it you'd know that corona is actually much scarier / deadlier
 AntiSquid: italy nearly 5k
 ZarthaxX: italy is so bad&#160;:(
 dbdr: agree with eulerscheZahl, climage change is much more serious
 inoryy: only reason we're not all dead rn is because countries and citizens reacted agressively
 dbdr: problem is people are bad at caring about long term issues
 Azkellas: until eof if not |
 AntiSquid: i follow it and all i see is media trying to promote panic
 emh: maybe corona fever will lead to global warming
 Azkellas: if no*
 inoryy: it's not more serious lol
 inoryy: no action with climate change = we'll have a bad time in 20-30 years
 ZarthaxX: yeah corona is a problem rn lol
 eulerscheZahl: a really bad one
 inoryy: no action with corona = 15% of population would be dead
 dbdr: and almost impossible to stop then
 inoryy: by next year
 AntiSquid: i bet most people wouldn't die from corona .
 dbdr: you illustrate my point innory
 dbdr: climate consequences will be worse, it's pretty clear if you check the science
 dbdr: but further in time from now
 inoryy: no
 inoryy: if we take apples to apples corona is worse.
 AntiSquid: if it were a serious virus we would be screwed though . testing is done way too slow
 inoryy: inaction vs inaction
 Neumann: CGBenchmark 1.1.1 available with a bugfix regarding random enemy selection
 eulerscheZahl: Neumann bringing us back to relevant topics :D
 inoryy: only reason it didn't overrun china is because they put half a billion ppl on lockdown when there were only like 200 cases, not even mortality just infections
 eulerscheZahl: that's much faster than the European reaction
 dbdr: many people become immune to the virus, after being sickgood luck getting immune to heat waves and floods
 inoryy: many but not all, including young ppl
 AntiSquid: it doesn't matter how fast they put them in quarantine it's nowhere near an apocalyptic bad horror movie virus
 dbdr: sure, many people will die, I agree it's very serious
 inoryy: soon 1k ppl will be dying every day in italy
 AntiSquid: lots of countries fail at quarantining people or have low standards of hygiene or don't really care as much and they didn't get wiped out .
 inoryy: purely from corona
 dbdr: things like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/04/climate-change-could-make-north-africa-and-middle-east-uninhabitable.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/04/climate-change-could-make-north-africa-and-middle-east-uninhabitable.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i know i'll trigger some users even more now: right now we have overpopulation, hard enough to grow food for everyone
 dbdr: entire regions unlivable
 inoryy: that's under strict lockdown
 eulerscheZahl: and you describe some dying as the end of the world
 AntiSquid: idk, the reaction to corona might trigger the end though, everything goes downhill from the overreaction
 dbdr: it's people don't realize the consequences of climate change. exactly like corina in the beginning. it takes time when something has not been experienced before 
 dbdr: AntiSquid true, things like that are possible
 inoryy: again, compare apples to apples
 Neumann: the end of what&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i don't see any campaigns about driving less or driving more environment friendly cars . just eat less meat lol
 Astrobytes: Fact of the matter is, *most* people don't give a flying fk about anything other than themselves until it directly affects them.
 AntiSquid: the end of the human world as it is, because the world won't end without 90% of the population
 Vicoool: for ocean of code, does anybody know if there will be more leagues eventually?
 Astrobytes: yes
 Illedan: Vicoool, click on Bronze League above the IDE
 inoryy: neither scenario are world-ending for that matter. if you seriously think over 100mil ppl dead in a year is less bad than couple of inhabitable continents in like 50 years idk what else to say, let's argee to disagree
 AntiSquid: people can repopulate
 inoryy: actually scratch that, would've been closer to 500mil
 JFB: emh - et least from morning. My bot was promoted at 2 AM, sb pushed me, and MSmits bot was near my - so I assume that sb pushed few bots ...
 inoryy: plus of course ravaged economy, etc
 dbdr: "couple of inhabitable continents", no big deal?
 AntiSquid: landmass is harder to terraform, actually we barely do anything about the deserts and we dream about terraforming mars
 emh: ok JFB&#160;:)
 inoryy: again, compared to 500mil dead in a year, yes it's not a big deal to me
 JHBonarius: question about OoC: can torpedos move diagonally?
 JFB: No
 inoryy: if you think it's about not taking climate change seriously then I regularly donate to orgs, support local activists, sold my car ~5 years ago and bike everywhere, try to eat less meat and so on
 dbdr: that's great!
 AntiSquid: yes, won't change much
 inoryy: it's a huge issue but cmon you can't be serious saying it's worse than ~5 WW2's worth of deaths
 eulerscheZahl: JHBonarius <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/torpedoRange.png">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/torpedoRange.png</a>
 JFB: In Itally 87% deaths are persons &gt;= 70 year olds
 eulerscheZahl: would have died in a few years
 AntiSquid: isn't the death toll 100% if the climate change gets bad&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair, medics had to decide whom to save
 dbdr: especially for older people
 egaetan: emh sorry
 PrivateClownOfPower_1c0d: Is there any angular based application development job here?
 dbdr: tens of thousands of people died of a heat wave in france. in 2016
 inoryy: for the last time, I'm talking about comparing apples to apples, inaction vs inaction
 emh: egaetan :p
 inoryy: alright it's going nowhere, I'm out :D
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: thank you
 AntiSquid: bye
 JFB: pandemic is somethin different - it is exponetial so it is not easy to predict final result
 dbdr: true. climate change is also exponential because of feedback loops. only in slow motion
 dbdr: but super hard to impact
 AntiSquid: ya and what will happen to the countries where people simply don't care as much or have poor standards of hygiene? do you expect any of them to be devoid of people by the end of this event?
 AntiSquid: i bet india will still be fine and crowded .
 JFB: AntiSquid - even in Italy deth&#160;% is around 10%. In very elderly population.
 JFB: So poor countries has a lot of young peples
 AntiSquid: a lot of elderly smokers
 JFB: I expect that in the worst scenario - in 2 years population will be bigger that current
 JFB: even in the worst case scenario
 JFB: so this pandemic is not zombie appocalypse
 Ajanx112: i am a simple man i see shortest mode i switch to python
 AntiSquid: it is, toilet paper eating zombies
 Ajanx112: oops sory wrong chat
 inoryy: never said it is, at least stop with the strawman
 JFB: AntiSquid - really you have problem with toilet paper?
 AntiSquid: yes lol
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy you were out
 AntiSquid: you think i am joking/?
 AntiSquid: UK went mental
 inoryy: you can't predict "worst case scenario" because it's already nowhere near that
 eulerscheZahl: in Germany toilet paper is sold out too
 AntiSquid: i use kitchen rolls, which i barely found in one shop 
 dbdr: use the daily mail&#160;;)
 dbdr: in one word
 eulerscheZahl: or the daily herold, or sunthey are pretty cheap and finally useful
 AntiSquid: it leaves a dark stain on the ass from the bullshit they print
 AntiSquid: dbdr
 JFB: I have bidet so it is not my problem&#160;;-)
 JHBonarius: plus they clog up the toilet
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: hard to flush that amount of nonsense down the toilet
 JFB: What nonsense?
 JHBonarius: bidet FTW. when I lived in india I had a shower with my toilet...
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/Hks6Nq7g6P4?t=137">https://youtu.be/Hks6Nq7g6P4?t=137</a>
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: is that a parody or real?
 dbdr: I highly recommend the whole channel
 dbdr: it's sad that we are not sure anymore
 JFB: Flattering the curve is not joke. It is real think. Probably only one we can do now
 dbdr: sure. it's using irony to convey important messages
 dbdr: quite like John Oliver
 AntiSquid: too bad they will ring the hospital non-stop demanding to speak to some medical staff so they know what their mom had for breakfast
 inoryy: the reason we're nowhere near "worst case scenario" is that thankfully ppl in charge did take it seriously, some more than others. the reason we are in this situation in the first place is because most normal ppl weren't taking it seriously...
 inoryy: maybe if ppl actually followed the news and self-isolated like 3 weeks ago we wouldn't be in this mess
 dbdr: goverments could have decided isolation 3 weeks ago
 inoryy: yeah so what you need a big man to tell you what to do?
 dbdr: it's not effective if only a few people do it
 AntiSquid: some people don't show symptoms 
 inoryy: more effective than not doing anything
 dbdr: it cannot be 95% of the population unless it's the law
 JFB: inoryy - I think that it depend of the country. I think that in my people do much better that I expected. Of course they are exceptions - but our goverment is much bigger problem. 
 inoryy: can't comment on Poland but here in UK even now most aren't taking it as seriously because "hurr durr the sun bullshit"
 dbdr: yeah, crap press seems to be esp strong in UK
 dbdr: is the sun et al still bullshitting about covid?
 inoryy: if you don't care about elderly then consider how many young ppl will lose their jobs now because ppl preferred to meme about how akthually climate is worse rather than think with their head and self-isolate asap
 dbdr: they could go the other way, the excitement of the apocalypse would sell too. at least that would help more
 dbdr: inoryy I think everyone cares about the elderly. it was in the context of "what is worse", which is a sad place to me in the first place
 inoryy: some ppl literally said they don't care above
 Astrobytes: No, in the UK, for one, many people don't care about the elderly. The "I'm alright Jack" mentality.
 ktaeah69: Yeh its stupid, those same people will care when they lose loved ones or when they themselves die from it
 egaetan: emh i think previous version was better, don't you want to rollback&#160;?
 Illedan: :P
 inoryy: and in the context of "what is worse" you're still not getting that you're comparing 30+ years of inaction wrt. climate change vs very swift and agressive measures on unseen scale
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan how is your colleague doing so far?
 emh: egaetan hehehe
 Illedan: didnt submit yet
 Illedan: emh, chill :O
 ktaeah69: anyone solving this problem with python?
 AntiSquid: "THIS"
 ktaeah69: "Short accounts make long friends"
 emh: Illedan was close hehe
 Illedan: 75% win vs me
 emh: wow nice
 emh: it still says 95% battles done. wonder what happened to the last 5%
 Illedan: you beat me on resub
 emh: ah there it settled
 emh: hmm.. so should I resub? :p
 dbdr: Norway is good at subs it seems
 emh: or find something to fix
 JFB: I think that discusion what is worse is at least strange. It looks as "divide and conquer" strategy. Both things need something to do. And sometimes solutions can help with both. 
 dbdr: must be the long coast
 eulerscheZahl: the viking anchestors, as i pointed out yesterday
 dbdr: viking submarines? :D
 ktaeah69: I was trying to do it by finding factors of the Result with&#160;% operator and trying to reduce the Result to 0 using + - / * in python
 AntiSquid: wow . that was a really dumb bug 
 dbdr: AntiSquid: :popcorn:
 JFB: dbdr - yeas vikings used submarines, dyo do not know it?
 AntiSquid: why did i even do that kind of bug
 dbdr: TIL
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: vikings used whales as submarines, it's in the bible
 eulerscheZahl: ktaeah69 this is a general chat, not about a specific puzzle or clash
 Uljahn: ktaeah69: do you use itertools.combinations and do you add results to set? that's how i solved it in python
 JFB: AntiSquid - so it is well documentes&#160;:-)
 dbdr: AntiSquid :D
 JFB: Uljahn - you discuss about OoC? 
 ktaeah69: @Uljahn will look into this, thanks!
 Uljahn: JFB: puzzle of the week
 kostis14: hey guys, sorry for the beginner question, is it possible to find a clash and practice on it?? i didn't  make it in time but i want to try it out more
 Uljahn: no, but there is a limited amount of clashes so they repeat
 JFB: Uljahn - Ok, simply it looks stange for me in OoC context  :-)
 kostis14: oh okay, thank you! 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/search/prime">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/search/prime</a>have fun kostis14
 emh: Illedan nope.. not this resub. seems worse a bit. changed a search parameter from 40 to 100. now will try 10000 and brace for timeout cancels hehe
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Pushing me down at least&#160;:(
 emh: ok 5th with this one
 emh: now let try 20
 NOURIBENZ: HI
 kostis14: @eulerscheZahl thank you so much!
 emh: oh no Illedan you resubmitted! scary changes?&#160;:)
 Illedan: No they seem worse
 Illedan: Scary to me :P
 Illedan: I'm really struggling with Nagrarok&#160;:/
 Illedan: And you crush me&#160;:(
 tonowak: let's say that I want to debug a runtime error that happens in the endgame. I would like to run my code through gdb. Of course, that is not possible on the CG servers, so I have to run my bot locally. Running through the referee isn't an option here, right? Because the gdb wouldn't run on the player. Do I have any way to do this, excluding implementing my own referee and compiling with it my two bots to a single file?
 Valdemar: You can dump all input from your strategy, copy it to txt file and run strategy from ide using that file.Disable all logs, except those with input prints and just copy from console output. If you print to stderr you need only remove excess strings with system messages and turn indicies 
 Valdemar: "running from ide" i mean desktop one
 tonowak: that's a solution I was looking for! thank you :D
 eulerscheZahl: i write all the inputs given to my program straight to stderr
 eulerscheZahl: then i have a script to download a replay and extract only the stderr, writing it to a file
 eulerscheZahl: then i pipe the file to the stdin of my local bot (which is deterministic, so i can reproduce every step)
 eulerscheZahl: that's how i can debug a specific situation
 tonowak: that's a nice, well-thought method :P I'll try to code this solution, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: the replay download will take some time, if you've never done it before
 eulerscheZahl: and have no experience with web requests
 eulerscheZahl: but it's a marathon contest, so you have some time \o/
 tonowak: I guess then it is possible to write some GUI options to my bot, so it can visualize some more stuff?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/uXHgaVh">https://imgur.com/a/uXHgaVh</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;;)
 tonowak: :O nice! do you have another code that makes the visualization (and parsing of input), or are you doing it mainly from the bot?
 eulerscheZahl: part of my bot, with
 eulerscheZahl: so i only execute that part offline
 tonowak: okay, that's the way I had in mind
 tonowak: well, now I'm confident that my idea to make such a visualizer would be something worth coding :D
 emh: eulerscheZahl nice :D
 tonowak: eulerscheZahl, do you have any nice way for running two bots locally against each other? I suppose that I can somehow run the referee from github, with a wrapper that automates the process, right? Is there a smarter way?
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - I do not uderstand why "SILENCE" reduce number of possible opponent positions in your visualisation ....
 eulerscheZahl: tonowak clone the official referee
 eulerscheZahl: then edit the Main.java in the test folder
 eulerscheZahl: to use your bots
 tonowak: ok, ty, I'll try that!
 Schneewittchen: @JFB Many possibilities can be crossed out due to the path restrictions
 eulerscheZahl: JFB my visualization is incomplete
 eulerscheZahl: regarding my own actions like torpedo
 AntiSquid: how many different things are there to take into account for enemy position? :D
 JFB: Schneewittchen - I understund but SILENCE alone can not reduce possiblities - one of possible moves is no move so it is not possible to reduce posiible moves. 
 emh: anyone doing opponent silence prediction?
 emh: guessing which way he took
 emh: I'm doing some kind of search
 Waffle3z: I don't make any assumptions, I just track what is possible
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - OK, it is clear - torpedos and scan can reduce of course, thanks
 JFB: *sonar
 emh: I was thinking maybe it's possible Markov chain or something to assume
 Schneewittchen: @JFB ya thats true
 Lks10: You could check which Silence direction gives the opponent the most movement space
 emh: hmm.. I think it's better to exploit somehow the fact that most people create contiguous areas
 emh: block style
 JFB: emh - I just plan to implement "fork". It is max 13 moves so it is x13 (usually much less)
 emh: JFB yes it's basically what I do. but then you get fork forks 13 * 13 etc. so I limit fork forks to 20
 JFB: You can add probabilities to each "fork"
 JFB: For now for me is only teory - I do not see SILENCE (or maybe hear SILENCE&#160;;-) )
 emh: enjoy the silence. sound of silence
 JFB:&#160;:-) I will 
 Lks10: surface -&gt; silence -&gt; surface -&gt; move. 2hp is a small price to pay for a high value silence
 JFB: In case when you have &gt; 2 points&#160;;-)
 struct: you  can surface 2 times?
 emh: huh? what makes it high value? what's the surface for?
 emh: to get rid of trail?
 JFB: reset path
 Lks10: yeah, silence can go in more directions if you surface before it
 emh: but surface also reveals your sector
 emh: and if you do a long silence and surface in 2 different sectors that gives analysis potential
 JFB: OK. So you have 17 possibilities but inorm your opponent about your sector and lost 2 hp
 Lks10: amazing right?
 emh: uhh... hmm. I don't get it hehe. or it's joke?
 JFB: emh - even this some sector is value information
 Lks10: It's like half a joke
 emh: I exploit most information about enemy position. just don't handle enemy mines
 JHBonarius: OoC is quite complex! so many things to do simultaneously. no easy seach tree
 JFB: True
 emh: I don't even have a tree. I just fork lists hehe
 emh: adding to them. growing them
 Lks10: There are also quite some different playstyles going around, im curious how the meta is gonna evolve
 emh: it's great game
 JHBonarius: it should be possible to do some pattern matching on the enemy trail thus far... no
 JHBonarius: no?
 AntiSquid: come back in a month and you'll know 
 Lks10: im gonna stay here for a month to play the game
 JHBonarius: I have limited time. it's already a miracle that I started
 emh: JHBonarius yes I started doing 3x3 cell Markov chains to direction, but stopped implementing because it was only half-baked idea
 Lks10: you can try pattern matching. You can also track every possible position the opponent can spawn in and eliminate positions as you go
 JFB: I hope that it is really scisor/paper/rock type game - for month contest it is ideal type
 Waffle3z: I keep a 2d array of everywhere the opponent can be and update it every time they move
 Waffle3z: if they silence then every position branches out by 4 in every direction
 emh: Waffle3z same.. but keeping lists of trails that led there as well
 Waffle3z: that would give you better information about mines
 emh: whoah 1736 lines already
 emh: and got rid of most duplicate code
 emh: 57k
 emh: over halfway to full
 tonowak: Internal error. Please contact codersHS@codingame.com with a screenshot and a copy of your code. Thanks.
 Waffle3z: only at 500. but you're using C#, that's pretty verbose isn't it
 tonowak: what do I do?
 emh: Waffle3z a bit. can be
 emh: tonowak probably an incorrect command. did you remember to add all parameters? separated with spaces? command separated by pipe?
 emh: tonowak or do as it says hehe
 NOURIBENZ: please how to run the github project locally?!

 emh: today woke up at 03:30 though
 Illedan: wow
 DefinitiveKev: Hi - only signed up to the site yesterday, I've got a semi-working usually-losing bot for Oceans Of Code. What happens when I press Submit - does that lock it in, or can I change it later, or ...?
 Illedan: You can change it during the next 28 days
 eulerscheZahl: click and find out
 DefinitiveKev: TY.
 eulerscheZahl: there is a limit if you submit every 2 or 3 minutesbut nothing you will hit as a normal user
 DefinitiveKev: Yeah, I was just concerned that it'd be permanent.
 eulerscheZahl: the longest block for submit spamming is 6h, don't worry and hit the yellow button&#160;;)
 DefinitiveKev: How much effort do people generally put into these things? I seem to be ranking #179 out of 303 in the lowest league with my initial attempt (which is basically a random walk and random fire). I wasn't expecting this version to do well, naturally, but I wonder how good the best bots are. Do people train ANNs on them and the like?
 TheLegendaryPotato: Hello World
 TheLegendaryPotato: Im a potato

 AntiSquid: tone down your expectations Kev1
 eulerscheZahl: there are some really skilled players trying hard to win

 struct: because the output comes after the timeout
 MindControler: PJA it might happen because your bot doesnt output in time, or doesnt output at all
 struct: and is never reached
 emh: not sure what I should code now. just waiting for the competition. guess I'll start better opponent prediction at some point, but it'll be advanced and will probably fail hehe
 PJA: but even if I try printing to stderr in the very start of the loop
 Illedan: I've been waiting the whole day to start from scratch on some real code :P
 emh: waiting?
 Illedan: Procastinating with trying more random spagetti
 emh: ah hehe
 struct: I start tomorrow
 emh: and now you started?
 struct: but already have some ideas
 Illedan: Not yet
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: I have some papers with plans and ideas
 Waffle3z: I don't know what to do besides try to tune which thing to charge and how to balance silence and mine
 emh: Waffle3z do you sonar?
 Waffle3z: yes
 emh: maybe can try sonaring the most number of enemy valid positions
 Waffle3z: if I don't know which sector you're in and you have more than 9 possible locations then I sonar
 PJA: I get a timeout and even if I try printing to stderr in the very start of the loop I cant see any output
 Waffle3z: I already sonar the sector with the most possible locations
 emh: oki
 emh: heh.. did 3 matches against Waffle3z in IDE and lost all. 4th one win
 Illedan: I'll be on discord if anyone need anything. I'm off to write better code. bye
 Waffle3z: are you doing any sort of pursuit/evasion or do you just space fill
 emh: both pursuit and evasion
 emh: and default movement is... well shouldn't say because people might target it :p
 emh: Waffle3z I see you are doing long stretches across the map. makes you easier to detect
 emh: there are not so many places those long stretches will fit
 AntiSquid: manspreading
 emh: hehe
 MadKnight: but is there Automaton2000spreading&#160;?
 Automaton2000: there are many ways to do this
 MadKnight: how to spread an Automaton2000, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: where is that in the forum
 Waffle3z: I was thinking of prioritizing directions that eliminate the fewest possible locations, I wonder if just a single-depth search would help with that
 emh: I check if I split the map by BFS
 emh: in that case choose the largest part
 Waffle3z: I have that from tron
 emh: I was thinking about doing a bunch of random DFSes and choosing the longest one
 emh: but have another heuristic that is simple and works now
 Waffle3z: all it's good for is minimizing surfaces anyway, at this point rounds typically end before either side surfaces once
 emh: yup
 emh: I saw my bot doing some blunders though
 emh: sometimes
 emh: painting itself into a corner
 emh: but not often
 emh: oooo egaetan submitting
 egaetan: emh no worry
 DefinitiveKev: How do people usually VCS this - just copy/paste code between editor and browser, or is there something smarter?
 egaetan: i still have some timeouts...
 emh: Kev1 there is an extension. but I prefer copy paste
 DefinitiveKev: Ta.
 ZarthaxX: CG-Sync Kev1
 AntiSquid: how's life ZarthaxX&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: corona like
 ZarthaxX: im good, relaxed, quarantined
 ZarthaxX: doing some work
 MindControler: If enemy uses sonar, I get it like this 'SONAR 4'?
 ZarthaxX: you squido=?
 MindControler: Or 'SONAR4'?
 AntiSquid: idk
 AntiSquid: i am alive
 AntiSquid: is all
 AntiSquid: i gonna work from home
 Waffle3z: what was oceanofcode based on?
 AntiSquid: captain sonar
 ZarthaxX: work from home?
 ZarthaxX: as a chef?
 AntiSquid: no
 ZarthaxX: u coder now?
 AntiSquid: change jobs twice now .. no, not coder, barely even software support lol
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: it's something to start with tho
 ZarthaxX: gz!
 tonowak: MindControler SONAR 4
 Neumann: CGBenchmark updated again ... timeout detection fix
 eulerscheZahl: to detect referee timeouts now
 eulerscheZahl: MindControler "SONAR 4", statement is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: waiting for CG to update it
 MindControler: Thanks
 AntiSquid: can you torpedo the land next to you or create a blast around the corner of an island?
 struct: it cant be in the island itself
 AntiSquid: so nobody taking a sunbath can be harmed
 eulerscheZahl: blast is always a square around the center of the explosion, blasterpoard can confirm
 AntiSquid: ya ok but you can't bomb the beach itself
 blasterpoard: it took me 10 minutes to realize that the beep I heard was actually a CG chat ping eulerscheZahl
 dbdr: chat pings audibly? :O
 blasterpoard: if you have "enable alerts" checked in chat settings
 blasterpoard: I think
 blasterpoard: btw why would I confirm anything, I have definitely not written a sim yet
 sudomakeinstall2: is it possible to do move and silence together?
 eulerscheZahl: sure dbdr
 sudomakeinstall2: this diagonal jump is silence + move?
 eulerscheZahl: and i think only if you get pinged while the CG chat is not your active tab
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible to combine both sudomakeinstall2
 emh: tried new starting position strategy: in middle of biggest free rectangle. didn't pan out. instead of random position with free sides
 eulerscheZahl: i'm procrastenating
 eulerscheZahl: contest duration only affects when i will stop doing so
 egaetan: mmh that's not fair <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/8f74nyd">https://imgur.com/a/8f74nyd</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you tied vs Illedan
 dbdr: seletion bias
 eulerscheZahl: for those wondering: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441</a>
 Schneewittchen: emh on the fly
 egaetan: emh please push me up&#160;!?
 egaetan: not this way!
 emh: egaetan oops
 egaetan: fair enough
 egaetan: Ouch
 eulerscheZahl: you go down like a submarine
 egaetan: lol
 egaetan: emh that wasn't nice
 emh: egaetan I should buy u a sub then at subway&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: they have gift cards
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if they are open these days though
 Lks10: im in Egae's screenshot :D
 eulerscheZahl: you are losing in that screenshot
 Lks10: no im on the side in the leaderboard
 PJA: can I move and use silence at the same turn?
 struct: yes
 egaetan: o/ Lks10 yes you are&#160;!
 struct: moves are applied in order you output
 struct: so you can also silence and then move
 PJA: so i can use torpedo and then move into the torpedo's zone?
 struct: the torpedo explodes before
 PJA: without getting hit
 struct: then you move
 PJA: wow
 PJA: ok
 struct: think on it like multiple turns
 struct: you torpedo
 struct: and then move
 struct: after you can even silence
 struct: and mine
 Lks10: you can even do a move command, which charges a special attack and then use that special attack
 PJA: and the input of the enemy's orders is by order
 PJA:&#160;?
 Lks10: yes
 struct: yes, so you can keep track
 emh: hmm.. lemme submit a small change. 10 -&gt; 20. torpedo thingy
 PJA: ok ty 
 egaetan: 10 -20 otrpedo thingy&#160;?!  what could that mean&#160;?
 karliso: Do both "MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO 0 0" and "TORPEDO 0 0 | MOVE N TORPEDO" charge torpedo?
 Lks10: the first one doesn't charge torpedo if torpedo is already fully charged
 Illedan: Yeah, the first one only if you miss a charge though
 emh: egaetan number of possible enemy positions before firing (in first torpedo if)
 egaetan: you shoot even if you don't know&#160;?
 Illedan: You have 20? :P I'm at 5 on that counter
 emh: yes. try to cover as many cells as possible to either hit or eliminate possible positions
 egaetan: i'm at 3
 emh: not sure 20 will work better than 10 yet though
 emh: and I have some conditions where I fire more or less randomly also
 Illedan: I do that in the end of the game :P if (yolomode) ...
 egaetan: i don't have an end game mode
 emh: Illedan I saw you also explode all mines at end of the game. I don't do that yet
 egaetan: you trigger mines too&#160;?
 tonowak: Illedan why you don't move when you trigger mines?
 Illedan: My bot can't do 2 things at one very well :D
 Illedan: *once
 Illedan: I have 2 situations where I have ninja hacked an if in there to do 1 more thing
 tonowak: really? :P
 Illedan: Yeah..
 Illedan: My Think method returns a string, instead of an IEnumerable of action. Which would have been far better :D
 Illedan: I'll try to fix that and see if it is better
 egaetan: 2 situations Illedan&#160;? I only found one
 Illedan: Move + torpedo if I target myselfMine + move and recharge MINE
 egaetan: mine + move AND recharge, that's clever
 egaetan: but i like the no move too
 Illedan: Yeah, moving gives me less rounds
 Illedan: earlier surface or more visible
 Illedan: Lets try
 Illedan: :D
 egaetan: oops
 Illedan: whops, I timeout sometimes :D
 eulerscheZahl: who doesn't?
 egaetan: i do timeout too
 Illedan: Because of that change I get a nullpointer :P
 Illedan: Aha, surfacing 
 eulerscheZahl: lame, my timeouts are real timeouts
 Illedan: 10 straight wins :rocket:
 Illedan: Just waiting for emh hell
 Illedan: And I won :tada:
 Illedan: 19 wins and euler&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you lost to the toad instead
 Illedan: Wierd map we had
 emh: Illedan ooooo
 emh: what did you change?
 struct: gg
 Illedan: I tried to do more than 1 action at a time :P
 emh: your are just at start of battles and 1st already
 emh: ohhhh
 emh: hehehe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fracking hunt for red october takes a little coding
 Illedan: Naive approach
 eulerscheZahl: still losing to me half your games :D
 Illedan: But it worked out :shrug:
 Illedan: I'll go back to my search now
 struct: can you mine trigger on same turn?
 struct: I guess you can
 eulerscheZahl: no
 struct: no
 struct:&#160;:(
 tonowak: Illedan I'm winning against you quite frequently :P
 emh: ok resubmitting. now support firing torpedo before as well as after move
 Illedan: Yeah tonowak, because you cheat :P
 tonowak: do I?
 eulerscheZahl: "You can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn."check the updated and not yet published statement struct
 struct: ah ok
 struct: ill wait
 eulerscheZahl: seems that we will have to wait till tomorrow
 struct: Im starting tomorrow
 tonowak: how do I cheat? :P by the way, how do I tag people in this chat? Just by writing someone's name?
 Illedan: Yeah, I assue Silence can only go 1 or 0 steps :D xD You got 4 and I have to reset
 AntiSquid: maniana maniana say all lazy folks
 kovi: hello
 Illedan: Hi
 tonowak: :O I got third place
 kovi: wow, new contest
 tonowak: I'm now above you, Illedan
 Illedan: I changed it
 Illedan: And resub
 Illedan: I now accept all silence distances
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Illedan: bye bye accuracy
 tonowak: :P
 Illedan: Oooh, I'll add a counter and increase my threshold if I observe such nonesense&#160;:)
 dbdr: isn't that more accurate Illedan?
 dbdr: all distances = no assumptions
 dbdr: or do you mean sth else?
 Illedan: No, because 90&#160;% of players use 1 or 0. Means I have more accurate detection&#160;;)
 tonowak: how do I get better and better place after my submission got fully judged? second place, above eulerscheZahl
 sudomakeinstall2: how to get this channel on the discord app?
 dbdr: right, depends how you define it
 Hjax: hes making an assumption about his opponents behavior in order to track much more accurately when hes right 
 emh: Illedan how do you observe the nonsense?
 Hjax: i supposed if theres no legal positions for his opponent 
 Illedan: If I have to reset my possible positions =&gt; increase it
 Hjax: you know your assumption failed 
 dbdr: and inacurate when he's not&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: tonowak others are still submitting and losing against youthat affects your score as well
 dbdr: I think 0 and 1 is just easier to code
 dbdr: so more used for now, but will probably change
 Illedan: Yeah, I didn't bother checking with Silence yet :P
 tonowak: first place! :O
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan submitting
 eulerscheZahl: emh too
 tonowak: a, okay&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: take a screenshot!
 dbdr: top 4 please resubmit too&#160;;)
 Hjax: meanwhile im still in wood league, i need to be less slow 
 struct: nice intel page works again :D
 Illedan: You have about 2 min&#160;;)
 dbdr: we can take turns making screenshots&#160;;)
 Illedan: Just change the html :P
 dbdr: I did that once on a newspaper to improve the headline :D
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: changing the HTML of print media
 Illedan: Thx for all the elo egaetan&#160;:)
 egaetan: Illedan you are a black sheep, no&#160;?
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: that's μ not elo
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: elo is the different it jumps on results?
 eulerscheZahl: ELO only supports 2 player games
 eulerscheZahl: would be fine here, but CG has 4 player games as well
 eulerscheZahl: so they use Trueskill
 eulerscheZahl: and you see the μ on the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: they don't show the sigma as users might get confused
 Illedan: Aiit. Don't even know how to write that letter on my keyboard&#160;:/
 emh: 3rd
 dbdr: mu - sigma actually
 dbdr: that's what's displayed
 eulerscheZahl: mini RAIC shows both values
 dbdr: that's cool!
 eulerscheZahl: right, minus sigma for confidence
 dbdr: that's why you tend to go up at the end of submits
 dbdr: sigma diminishes
 Illedan: I feel I go down later in submits
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aicups.ru/rating/">https://aicups.ru/rating/</a>mu + sigma
 Illedan: :clap: egaetan. Something new?
 eulerscheZahl: wow, a big lead
 dbdr: they should show it on a 2d graph, with the confidence interval
 egaetan: Illedan for sure
 egaetan: Illedan stop
 dbdr: mu - sigma .. mu .. mu + sigma
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 dbdr: wow, gz egaetan!
 egaetan: it hurts you know
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441499635">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441499635</a>
 emh: hehe
 emh: yup nice mine placement
 egaetan: Why did i did SURFACE turn 133&#160;!?
 kovi: no action?
 dbdr: both placed a lot of mines, barely used them
 Schneewittchen: Because there was a lack of mines in the field.
 dbdr: ended all a torpedo fight
 dbdr: what a waste. noobs&#160;;)
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 egaetan: i surface to avoid a potential mine, that's dumb
 Illedan: Oh, you track enemy mines? :O
 dbdr: CG player is messed up, shows all stdout as if it came from red
 dbdr: but prints both red and orange on every turn
 dbdr: in a sequential game
 dbdr: :thinking:
 egaetan: Illedan yes
 Illedan: I should start doing that soon, as more follow on the mine game&#160;:(
 egaetan: that's a nightmare, but i only print one instruction per turn
 smeagol: c'est l'occasion pour finir 1 ere
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441501912">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/441501912</a>wow, that's a large lake
 eulerscheZahl: english please smeagol

 smeagol: Hi eulersche
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Illedan: Wow, that's a big one
 smeagol: I 'm sorry
 Illedan: I'll keep that to test
 dbdr: the mine can even reach the sea from the lake
 eulerscheZahl: you mean the blast?
 emh: fixed a bug. still 3rd
 dbdr: yes
 tonowak: had anyone had some luck with implementing hit &amp; run/silence?
 egaetan: Illedan again&#160;!?
 Illedan: Hm, nah just lucky.
 Illedan: I'm trying to use silence only when there is  &gt; X number of possible spots to move to
 egaetan: i do that
 egaetan: but my X is not scientificly proved
 Illedan: Is anything else in your code proved scientifically? :P
 eulerscheZahl: the addition of 2 numbers
 eulerscheZahl: posX + moveX = newPosX
 Illedan: :clap:
 Schneewittchen: :thinking:
 emh: doing heavy refactoring for multiple org^^^ hrrg I mean action support. will probably break lots
 Illedan: Looking forward to 300 rounds tomorrow
 sudomakeinstall2: how to get this channel on discord app?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't, this chat is XMPP
 sudomakeinstall2: ok thanks
 emh: Illedan it will be 300?
 Illedan: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: 1 place + 299 move turns
 tonowak: again in top5 :D
 egaetan: 300 turns&#160;? i think nerf the mines&#160;?
 OmidSafari: hi
 tonowak: hi
 OmidSafari: how ar u?
 tonowak: good. And you?
 OmidSafari: fine thanks
 OmidSafari: what is DISCORD?
 tonowak: an alternative, app-based chat
 tonowak: though this chat is more active
 sanfarans: czesc Tomek, pamietam cie z oia (ang. what a beautiful day)
 OmidSafari: HOW long u ar in Coding game?
 tonowak: o kurczę (eng. indeed)
 JFB:&#160;:-) 
 emh: first 10 battles win. nice. refactor troubles over?&#160;:)
 tonowak: sanfarans I would say something more, but it is an english chat
 ZarthaxX: go to a private chat or to your channel lang
 emh: 1st. yay&#160;:)
 sanfarans: tonowak ikr
 egaetan: gg emh
 AntiSquid: if you type non english without avatar = ban @_@
 emh: gg egaetan
 sanfarans: uhhh pls no
 AntiSquid: just get an avatar then
 sanfarans: oh ok
 JFB: AntiSquid - easy - it is creative he use non english to creative translation&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: yes and i use creative ways to make people upload an avatar
 muy31: question... in ocean of code, say you found exactly where your opponent is
 muy31: What is the strategy you then want to employ to kill it
 muy31: defeat it i mean
 Uljahn: hit and run
 muy31: you just move toward it?
 muy31: and drop weapons
 muy31: or something
 sanfarans: here you go
 sanfarans: its beanos
 tonowak: and what can you do to reduce his health? only torpedoes (I'm assuming you are in wood league)
 muy31: i mean yeeah
 muy31: just started
 Uljahn: you can just try to stay longer underwater
 Schneewittchen: back on track
 muy31: well thanks
 egaetan: gg Schneewittchen
 emh: oh no dropped to 2nd..
 emh: egaetan grrr!
 egaetan: pfouuuu emh next time maybe
 sanfarans: is it possible to drop leagues?
 AntiSquid: no
 sanfarans: ok thanks, kinda epic
 Uljahn: jeez, 28 days of 1st place switches
 AntiSquid: unless you make new account or delete your current one and then recreate it
 AntiSquid: can beat boss in IDE, gg bottleneck ladder
 MostComplicatedUsername: How do I save my code without submitting it?
 Uljahn: press play
 MostComplicatedUsername: ok
 AntiSquid: in windows media player
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:/
 muy31: haha
 Uljahn: "play my code" button saves your last code
 emh: ok trying again
 egaetan: noooo
 AntiSquid: ladder shuffle is normal
 emh: who is this newcomer AnEsotericMan?
 AntiSquid: don't bother looking at it until the last day
 AntiSquid: an esoteric man i guess
 AnEsotericMan: It's true
 emh: AnEsotericMan are you an alt? why so sudden? why y u no surprise us?
 AnEsotericMan: Not an alt, just haven't done any challenges here before, really
 emh: ohh
 egaetan: Hi AnEsotericMan
 AntiSquid: he is the highest python, why would it be an alt :p
 emh: snakes on a plane. that high?
 AnEsotericMan: only spot you may have seen me before is in Halite 3 I ended 37th as ColinWHart
 emh: ok I hardly played Halite
 AnEsotericMan: The real question is how much better my both will do once I use silence and mines
 JFB: 37th is good result
 emh: AnEsotericMan how many lines?
 JFB: Say - 33
 Uljahn: numpy tricks?
 AnEsotericMan: Looks like 537 right now, including reasonable spacing and sparse comments
 AntiSquid: python one liner code golf duh
 egaetan: emh vs Illedan are you playing in team&#160;?
 emh: AnEsotericMan wow unfair. me and my 1800 lines spent hard work on this game. everyone with their half-k lines.. buuuhuuu
 emh: egaetan hehe no
 AnEsotericMan: Python has some advantages if you're judging by linecount, yeah
 egaetan: 950 loc in Java
 emh: looks like this submit not gonna cut it either
 sanfarans: wtf my wood2 code got me promoted to bronze
 sanfarans: i havent even tried playing with new toys
 Schneewittchen: 1441 java with javaDoc of course ^^
 Uljahn: im 20th with 230 LoCs and a very low effort bot, so quality drops pretty fast outside of top-10 :smirk:
 emh: Schneewittchen finally someone else who's got a big chunk of lines hehe
 emh: Uljahn unfair! 230! unheard of
 icecream17: 0 possibleOpp positions?
 egaetan: Schneewittchen with Javadoc really&#160;!?
 emh: egaetan thanks to you amma have to sleep in 2nd place tonight...&#160;:(
 egaetan: it depends, at wich time do you go to bed tonight&#160;?
 emh: hey 3rd viking icecuber
 emh: egaetan I don't think I can code much more tonight.. so probably soon
 Schneewittchen: @egatan Noo just kiddin :D But will soon be necessary if the pile of spaghetti code keeps piling up.
 Schneewittchen: And maybe adding sonar, mines and delete the movement from wood 2 :thinking:
 egaetan: maybe... adding mines help
 egaetan: sonar i dont know yet
 egaetan: emh you are not sleeping&#160;?
 Schneewittchen: would probably help to prevent the timeouts because of the 100000 paths
 egaetan: i timeout long before 100k
 Schneewittchen: yea around 5k :D
 egaetan: me too
 Schneewittchen: silence ... 
 Schneewittchen: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 emh: egaetan not yet
 PJA: if both me and the enemy fired a torpedo and the enemy lost hp, is there  a why that I can know what damaged the emeny?
 egaetan: you was first again some seconds ago emh
 egaetan: and third and back snd
 emh: ohh&#160;:)
 tonowak: PJA the referee doesn't output such info
 tonowak: though it might be possible to dedude it
 PJA: how?
 tonowak: I am able to, kind of&#160;:) but I won't tell it
 egaetan: PJA you can't
 Uljahn: it means the enemy is near one of two cells so you need additional info from previous turns i guess
 struct: you can guess
 struct: buty cant be certain 100%
 struct: at least in all cases
 egaetan: but the ennemy firing in his shoes should be dumb enough to loose anyway
 Uljahn: true
 PJA: ty all
 tonowak: emh you dropped
 JBM: stream kinda starting now, sorry for the delay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm">https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm</a>
 emh: ok resubmit
 Schneewittchen: but can he score &gt; 40?
 egaetan: tonowak gg
 tonowak: thanks :D
 WeberJulian: does this mean that you can purposefully shoot yourself if you see that the enemy fired a torpedo so that the enemy thinks you're somewhere else&#160;?
 emh: JBM late night streaming? hmm
 tonowak: WeberJulian possibly, yes, if the enemy does indeed have such logic
 egaetan: tonowak what are the numbers in your msg&#160;?
 egaetan: JBM -&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm">https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm</a>
 tonowak: just some random stuff&#160;:)
 Schneewittchen: second the opp positions i would guess
 egaetan: hmmm
 Schneewittchen: *hitted 2*
 egaetan: tonowak MOVE E SILENCE | TORPEDO 11 0 | SILENCE E 3 | MSG 0 3 5 that's unfair
 tonowak: egaetan why is that unfair? :P
 egaetan: move + torpedo + silence
 JFB: Hit end run
 JFB: *end
 WeberJulian: but you can't MOVE ans SILENCE at the same time can you&#160;?
 JFB: Why not?
 WeberJulian: Someone told me on an another channel that SILENCE was already a move action
 Schneewittchen: Oh wait ... what
 egaetan: Illedan, emh, Elfuego submitting...
 tonowak: it is not true, you can do any action you want, but only once per turn. So move &amp; silence is find
 egaetan: how to have a stable leaderboard
 JFB: I think that you can do this same command twice. MOVE &amp; SILENCE are different commands
 JFB: *can not do
 emh: resubmitting. had a sonar disabling bug. just wanted to invest less in sonar towards end of game
 egaetan: it just so unfair, nobody does that
 JFB: tomorrow most will do
 JFB: egaetan - submarine is unfair from definition

 Illedan: Hm, nice. top 10 has equal amounts of Norwegians and French&#160;:) Gotta be a first
 sanfarans: when will there be more leagues?
 Illedan: 3/27/20
 Illedan: Click on the League marker above the Viewer
 tonowak: you can click on the "bronze league" text on the top
 sanfarans: ok thanks
 emh: ok once more. narrower torpedo range. 5
 emh: enemy positions
 emh: instead of 10
 egaetan: Torpedo range 10 do you mean silence + torpedo&#160;?
 emh: no no
 emh: just how many positions of enemy there can be
 JFB: 10? Rather 9? or even 8
 egaetan: what do you mean emh&#160;?
 tonowak: JFB does that make such a difference?
 emh: how certain of enemy position before firing
 egaetan: you tried 20 was worst&#160;?
 Schneewittchen: 25 :thinking:
 egaetan: do you mean 5% or 1/5&#160;?
 JFB: tonowak - it depends&#160;:-) 
 JFB: Siply - silendce + no torpedo == #30
 RanN42: what does time out means in ocean of code?
 RanN42: after 10 turns it just times out...
 emh: egaetan 1/5
 emh: seems like 1/10 was better
 egaetan: sure of position or sure to hit&#160;?
 emh: maybe
 icecream17: comment a portion of the code and get the ms
 tonowak: RanN42 that means a runtime error or that you used more than 50 milliseconds on a turn
 struct: RanN42 it means you didint output in time
 Illedan: Huge difference if you manage to reduce locations before the enemy uses Silence though
 emh: just the number of possible enemy positions is 5
 emh: or less
 struct: maybe you have infinite loop?
 RanN42: oh ok
 egaetan: emh i've the same with 3 only
 egaetan: i don't like to fire free
 egaetan: i trigger mine free
 RanN42: is there any way to know what action takes most of the turn time?
 tonowak: yes. You can google how to measure time in code
 RanN42: oh ok thx
 tonowak: though remember that you could also have a runtime error
 RanN42: no i dont get any error its just on the round my torpedo is ready im doing a lot of calculation to find best spot and the round times out
 tonowak: hmm the same bot now got 5th place instead of 1st. Is that normal behavior?
 Illedan: Too few games
 Illedan: Random maps
 Illedan: And random starting position
 Illedan: as we don't yet to swapped games
 Schneewittchen: Have u planned swapped games?
 Illedan: I hope we can do it in Legend and in the rerun
 tonowak: ok, ty. Then I guess I'll go to sleep. I hope I'll stay in top10 tomorrow morning :P
 Illedan: Promise nothing ^^
 egaetan: tonowak gg &amp; gn
 tonowak: gn
 Illedan: gn
 icecream17: Yes! I tied against the Wood 2 bot!!!

 egaetan: already 3go to bed&#160;! tonowak
 Illedan: Damn random loses vs &gt; 100 -.-
 egaetan: don't blame yourself
 Zenoscave: What is the current meta?
 Zenoscave: I just finished my base framework
 Zenoscave: might need to look at some good replays
 egaetan: hide yourself
 RanN42: its so weird in a random round the ocean of code just time out even before it start to execute any code in the game loop, not even first line get executed and it doesnt have any reason to time out.&#160;:(  
 icecream17: just comment out specfic functions
 RanN42: ok
 icecream17: make a variable and show the ms
 icecream17: the round is probably not random, there's an exception or situation which your code fails or something
 RanN42: ok  found out that if i comment the torpedo code it not crash but if i dont it crashes at random round and doesnt even do the stuff before for some reason
 icecream17: interesting [no comment]
 RoboStac: are you using python?
 RanN42: yes
 RoboStac: make sure you put flush=True in all your debug prints
 RoboStac: or they get buffered
 RoboStac: and you have no idea where you actually got to
 RanN42: how like this? print("", flush=True)
 RoboStac: yeah
 RanN42: ok i will keep debugging that
 Uljahn: print("debug", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 ZarthaxX: what is this error...
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441550699">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441550699</a>
 Uljahn: no direction for move
 ZarthaxX: aight
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Illedan: Robo joining ooc?
 RoboStac: probably later
 RoboStac: not started yet
 Schneewittchen: Say bye to the crown if he has joined :D
 emh: resubmitted. more enemy chasing. explode mines near end.
 Illedan: I wont keep that crown for long anyway
 Illedan: But I'll try&#160;:)
 muy31: do you have to move in ocean of code
 muy31: too lazy to check
 emh: muy31 yes. unless you do silence 0
 emh: or another action
 emh: to replace
 muy31: how did you turn that text red?
 Illedan: How is that sleep doing emh? :P 
 emh: Illedan sleep? whaaat? hehehee
 Illedan: :D
 struct: muy31 if he types your name it shows red for you
 muy31: oh damn
 muy31: i didnt know
 struct: also you should get a ping sound
 muy31: yeah
 Illedan: Damn, so close
 egaetan: go to sleep Illedan
 struct: a bit
 Illedan: I have my 1 hour old code that won this version of you 9-1 egaetan :P
 Zenoscave: PEW PEW ZarthaxX
 egaetan:&#160;:(
 Tinyphoenix: hi
 Illedan: I'll go to sleep if it stops 1st :D
 egaetan: I hope it's the one i play aginst in ide
 Illedan: heh
 struct: dbdr you there?
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: struct?
 struct: sorry
 struct: I was trying to be sure
 struct: on rust
 struct: if I put rust bot that is arena on IDE
 struct: it plays the code in "release" right
 dbdr: I don't think so
 dbdr: people get timeouts with bots that don't in the arena
 egaetan: Illedan grrrr
 Illedan: What did I do? :P
 Illedan: Pushing failed submits&#160;:(
 egaetan: gn
 Illedan: Casually eating all of emhs' mines -.-
 Illedan: gn
 emh: gn Illedan
 OmidSafari: hi
 sudomakeinstall2: SILENCE W 1 SONAR|TORPEDO 10 5
 sudomakeinstall2: is this illegal?
 Zenoscave: yes
 Zenoscave: SILENCE only takes direction and distance
 Zenoscave: no charge
 sudomakeinstall2: oh thanks
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 jiniiii: hi
 HMu0510: hi
 MassiveRobot_1b90: bye
 struct: euler or Illedan here?
 Zenoscave: no
 Zenoscave: just me
 struct: damn&#160;:(
 struct: I think its a little bug
 Zenoscave: What can I help with&#160;;)
 struct: but im not sure
 Zenoscave: I can't help with that
 struct: SILENCE dir 0
 struct: works
 struct: is that supposed&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Yes
 struct: ah right
 Zenoscave: you can move 0 spaces with silence
 struct: it says 00 to 4 cells
 struct: 0*
 Zenoscave: lol
 Schneewittchen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/441571756">https://www.codingame.com/replay/441571756</a>
 Schneewittchen: @tonowak is the master of cell deforming
 Schneewittchen: Bug or feature?
 stormKx18: does anybody knows if you can destroy enemy mines with a torpedo?
 Schneewittchen: I think you cant do that
 stormKx18: ok, I will try it, thanks
 emh: crossed 2k lines
 PYB: so quick question
 Schneewittchen: How is your tracking going?
 PYB: why can we click on "launch clash" prior to the timer finishing?
 PYB: why would a clash start before all players had  a chance to join?
 Schneewittchen: @PYB Can you always start or only as the host?
 PYB: well everytime I click to join a new clash, some people join, and if I click on "lauch clash" it starts right away. It doens't wait for the time
 PYB: timer
 PYB: I dont know the concept of host
 Schneewittchen: If you are the first player in the clash I would suggest that you are the host
 PYB: ahhh ok
 Beerus: i didn't saw an announcement for contest
 Beerus: i think the next one was on Mau
 Beerus: May
 PYB: @Schneewittchen  THanks
 Astrobytes: Beerus yeah there was an email, it's an 'emergency contest' :DEveryone's on lockdown/quarantine so CG and some community members decided there should be a contest in the downtime
 Beerus: that's awesome
 Beerus: thank you
 Zenoscave: I fixed something and I'm not sure what
 Zenoscave: My bot just jumped to ~35th
 icecream17: how do you floodfill
 PatrickMcGinnisII: your pew pew , pew pewed
 Zenoscave: BFS is enough for this game 
 Zenoscave: I think
 Gooddae: hi guys
 Zenoscave: thx PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I flood fill with a stack, but I'm using a 2 dim array.  If you use OOP tile nodes, there's plenty of BFS examples
 Zenoscave: Why stack with 2D?
 Zenoscave: some advantage?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: non-recursive
 Zenoscave: ah true
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u can do a couple different ways, but if input is a grid array with valid/invalid set (map).  And a to x,y from x1,y1 it's pretty easy just to set a parent direction.  You can grab the last value for the first move on path, or grab the entire path inverting N to S, E to W, etc.  ok, way too much info
 Zenoscave: I just use a neighborhood function
 Zenoscave: with a regular queue
 struct: ill just use my STC function
 Zenoscave: We're doomed struct wins
 struct: I pasted it here before
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what does STC stand for?
 struct: smash the code
 Zenoscave: smash the code
 struct: I run like millions of floodfills per turn sometimes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well i did pretty good floodfilling in tron
 PatrickMcGinnisII: same basic method
 Zenoscave: Have you tried that with avx struct?
 Hjax: how do peoples flood fills deal with dead ends? 
 struct: no, I only tried avx on CSB
 struct: what do you mean Hjax?
 Hjax: like, if you make a U shape 
 Hjax: and your sub goes into the middle of it 
 Hjax: well crap, we are stuck, guess we have to surface 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did you github the stc struct?
 Zenoscave: floodfill from each possible move and choose the one that leaves most room is all I do
 Hjax: just knowing the amount of space doesnt mean the submarine can path through the whole area 
 struct: No Patrick I just shared the floodfill function here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oic
 Hjax: Zenoscave yeah thats probably "good enough" buts its not optimal 
 Zenoscave: depth 1 works fine Hjax not so much with depth 0
 Zenoscave: Too much else with the game to worry
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: hey man~
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: i need help
 Hjax: maybe im worrying about something too unimportant to matter
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: please
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hjax well u can use a voroni method to weight the 4 possible moves each turn to maximize movable area
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i haven't done it yet
 Zenoscave: I believe so Hjax. just avoid surfacing somewhat but silence is much more important
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: everybodt
 Zenoscave: who are you talking to TheoreticalScone_afaa
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: everybody
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i haven't done it, because I want to attack more.  that kind of decision should be done on turn 0
 Zenoscave: 60% winrate against egaetan in local
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: put your hadns up!!!
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: sorry
 Zenoscave: I don't have any hadns
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: no hands?
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: true?
 Zenoscave: no I have hands
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they are pew pews
 Zenoscave: pew pew
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: i want
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: solve this problem
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: help me please
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: firend
 PatrickMcGinnisII: send TP, lol
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: what's mean TP?
 Zenoscave: toilet paper
 Scarfield: apparently the most important thing to have during quratine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I coded for beer in college
 emh: town portal
 Zenoscave: true emh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ooooh a Diablo enthusiast
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: hmm 
 stabdard: 有中文就太棒了
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: hey
 emh: in the desolates wastes of Orinoc. maybe there you will find an answer
 Zenoscave: 14/20 wins against egaetan
 Zenoscave: just need to fix some small bugs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok AoM i guess
 Zenoscave: Hero Siege is fun too
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: hello
 Zenoscave: really crappy off brand Moba
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: 안녕하세요
 syoon: cheese crust
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what is asia waking up now?
 emh: Zenoscave I'm above egaetan. test against me&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Ok will do
 syoon: thx
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: where are you from&#160;?
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: hey
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: korea
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: answer me
 emh: actually I ended up numero uno! :D
 syoon: 왜 갑자기 영어씀
 emh: finally I can get some sleep then hehe
 Zenoscave: gratz emh
 Zenoscave: I'm comming for ya
 emh: thx&#160;:)
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: hey
 emh: better go now then before you coming hehe
 stabdard: korea is beautiful
 emh: good night
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: everyone
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: solve this problem plz
 JeonHyun9: sibal
 Zenoscave: gn
 Scarfield: gn
 Gooddae: hey crazy korean
 Zenoscave: 5/5 against you emh
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
 Gooddae: get off
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: shut up[
 Zenoscave: W/L i mean
 JeonHyun9: moonje jot gat ne
 Scarfield: stop spamming
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: oh
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: my god
 Gooddae: get out COIVD-19 guys
 emh: Zenoscave ah ok.. so you will be threat I guess?
 JeonHyun9: sorry
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: What The Hell
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: corona
 Zenoscave: If I fix this bug... and find it first
 TheoreticalScone_afaa: you will get corona
 Gooddae: i love pari ji sung
 Gooddae: not you guys
 Zenoscave: MODS
 Scarfield: you have been fast getting to the top zeno? :muscle:
 Gooddae: park*
 Zenoscave: yeah was ~80 an hour ago
 Gooddae: i love heung-min Son
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Fuck off Good bae
 Gooddae: not bae 
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Yeag Gooddae
 Gooddae: sorry
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Ok
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Dont say that
 Gooddae: im noob
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: We are not COVID guys
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Got it?&gt;
 Gooddae: where r u from?
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Korea
 Gooddae: oh god..
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Got it?
 Gooddae: Moon Jane alright?
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: Yeah
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: I dont wanna apply anymore
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: I am busy
 Gooddae: okay, do your job
 icecream17: hmmm timeout
 CJDawson: halp
 icecream17: what happened?
 CJDawson: I tried to learn C
 icecream17: I only know 1 language....
 CJDawson: What's that?
 icecream17: javascript
 CJDawson: k
 CJDawson: I only know Python, C# and Java
 stormKx18: icecream - maybe in that turn your code did not send an output
 icecream17: it does eventually... but it takes too long in the 6th or 8th move
 icecream17: so timeout and i lose
 sanfarans: any idea why can my opponentOrders string cin empty?
 sanfarans: I do cin.ignore() before getline
 sanfarans: C++
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47731e34-7d39-4b40-960a-74c0f87a59e2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47731e34-7d39-4b40-960a-74c0f87a59e2</a>
 Scarfield: this is how my default code looks like for reading that part of input, you have the same?
 sanfarans: yup pretty much
 sanfarans: my variables are global though
 Scarfield: no idea then&#160;:(
 sanfarans: thanks for effort&#160;:)
 Scarfield: small effort, but no problem :p

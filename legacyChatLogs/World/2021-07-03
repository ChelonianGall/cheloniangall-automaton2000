 Wontonimo: what up PranavVK
 art10101: HELLO
 Marchete: happy caturday
 BlaiseEbuth: :kissing_cat:
 KiwiTae:&#160;:*
 jacek: happy Caturday
 mhommed: السلام
 BlaiseEbuth: Peace. :peace: But speak english on this chan plz
 jacek: oO
 TipuTare: how do i debug again?
 dbdr: print to standard error is the easiest
 TipuTare: huh?
 dbdr: which language?
 TipuTare: phyton 3
 KiwiTae: print("",file=sys.stderr) 
 TipuTare: ty
 TipuTare: i dont get how it works so can u please just help me with my code
 TipuTare: its a begginer one
 TipuTare: really simple
 KiwiTae: sure

 SkyDreamer: flush=True
 KiwiTae: TipuTare whats the context? ~ horse dual?
 TipuTare: yep
 GaborHajas: cheers to everyone practicing their skills even on a weekend!
 TipuTare: im not going anywhere so might as well do something with my life
 TipuTare: u need to output the difference between the highest power and the second highest KiwiTare
 TipuTare: KiwiTae
 Westicles: All right, I got the Ruby 26 char golf compression finally.  For sale to the highest bidder
 KiwiTae: its not that
 TipuTare: The difference D between the two closest strengths. D is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
 BlaiseEbuth: gimme, and I'll consider don't take tour soul immediately... :imp:
 TipuTare: i dont get what wrong
 BlaiseEbuth: Your code I guess
 TipuTare:&#160;:))

 TipuTare: can someone check it
 TipuTare: nvm
 TipuTare: im a dummy
 Westicles: I still haven't cracked the mystery of Chuck Norris.  Somebody must have blabbed a great bash or perl one at some point, too many hillbillies with good solutions
 dbdr: who are the hillibillies? :D
 Westicles: Well, zeno for one.  No way he figured that out on his own
 dbdr: how kind
 BlaiseEbuth: Pew pewing around
 sprkrd: Wontonimo it creeps me out a little bit how you keep an eye on how many times random people submit to CSB, you're like the all-seing eye :joy::joy:
 BlaiseEbuth: Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak: a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. 
 dbdr: :japanese_ogre:
 jacek: wooo stockfish 14
 KP56: YES
 Wontonimo: Bwahahahah&#160;!  sprkrd, it's as easy as looking at the leaderboard and using the Computing dropdown.
 Wontonimo: I've been helping a few people on CSB so I've been hanging out there
 MiyamuraIzumi: hahahahah
 MiyamuraIzumi: just feel too lazy&#160;:*
 Wontonimo: Nice UTTT bot MiyamuraIzumi.  What algo are you using&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: My current bot is just play a quite simple heuristic
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am still trying to use MCTS.
 Wontonimo: may i suggest first trying to implement flatMC before MCTS
 Wontonimo: flatMC will get you to Gold, all of it is reusable to implement MCTS, and it is dead simple to implement
 Wontonimo: flatMC is implemented like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0372190b-4ddd-4cf9-8cdd-b2cc9d519edf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0372190b-4ddd-4cf9-8cdd-b2cc9d519edf</a>
 Wontonimo: once you run out or time, play the legal move that has the most wins.
 Wontonimo: MiyamuraIzumi, feel free to PM me for more details if you like
 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks
 jacek: oh my
 RajdeepBiswas: simp lol is this twitch
 WhiteGlove: I dont quite understand the Alice's Roche Limit
 geppoz: try Sokoban
 WhiteGlove: I pass the first two test, but on submit... I get hardcoded&#160;:/
 RajdeepBiswas: oh why friend
 WhiteGlove: Im going to do the whole thing again..
 geppoz: my first solution in 1/2 hour passes 46%
 geppoz: but just exploring tree random, without even any metric
 geppoz: so I exceeded sometimes the 400 moves
 geppoz: ops, found a bug, 66% now
 WhiteGlove: good job, keep up. Saw a bug in mine too&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 geppoz: I think I could get 100% just dropping out the dead-end states
 geppoz: that now I continue to explore, hoping in vain :D
 geppoz: I'm trying to solve that as "fastest" CoC, let's try if I can in &lt;1h
 struct: which game?
 geppoz: puzzle of the week
 geppoz: sokoban
 jacek: try something easier from that author, like onitama
 geppoz: yes, done
 geppoz: it is enough
 geppoz: even in js
 geppoz: I will not check that "BFS" or "pathfindings" topics learned :D
 geppoz: well BFS yes, but in very trivial way
 TipuTare: bruh\
 TipuTare: the price on a coding bootcamps are crazy
 TipuTare: For $290 monthly subscription, 
 TipuTare: whos buying that?
 MSmits: people for whom the bottleneck is not money but brains
 DaNinja: in sokoban, just pruning bad corners is enough for fast languages like C++
 DaNinja: but for slower languages like JS I think you need to prune bad side walls too
 TipuTare: MSmits?
 MSmits: hi TipuTare
 jacek: Oo
 TipuTare: can u help me with a code error?
 MSmits: no idea
 TipuTare: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/529d8fc4-6bcc-44f1-a544-8645f8dee65f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/529d8fc4-6bcc-44f1-a544-8645f8dee65f</a>
 TipuTare: at Answer.py. in &lt;listcomp&gt; on line 12at Answer.py. in &lt;module&gt; on line 12
 TipuTare: whats this error tho
 TipuTare: in horse racing duals
 geppoz: DaNinja no, just dont push in corned is enough in hs
 geppoz: *js
 MSmits: sorry, I don't know TipuTare
 DaNinja: my js version must have a bug then...
 TipuTare: ok
 MSmits: TipuTare maybe you are trying to lookup at index -1&#160;?
 WhiteGlove: why the **** it says hardcoded&#160;:(
 MSmits: nah thats not it
 MSmits: try to use some error messages to figure it out
 WhiteGlove: yeah, and it works 
 MSmits: I was talking to TipuTare
 WhiteGlove: k.
 MSmits: it suggests your solution may be hardcoded if the testcases succeed but the validators dont
 MSmits: the validators are supposed to be equivalent to test cases only with different input
 WhiteGlove: it only fails one
 MSmits: if you solution fails, it may not be generalized enough
 MSmits: it always does when this happens
 MSmits: otherwise you testcases would not have succeeded
 WhiteGlove: I have created a class inside a class to work better, may be that?
 MSmits: i have no idea
 WhiteGlove: also repetitive tasks I made a function
 MSmits: just try to read the problem description closely and make your solution as simple as possible
 WhiteGlove: I went with the idea of clean code
 MSmits: good
 DaNinja: TipuTare try removing the line pi = int(input())
 DaNinja: and remove for i in range(n):
 TipuTare: why?
 TipuTare: oh
 TipuTare: yeah u are right
 DaNinja: youre reading twice
 KiwiTae: my wait bot is better than my sim&#160;:")
 KiwiTae: lol
 struct: o.o
 KiwiTae: got some bugsy ~
 sprkrd: Got 100% in Sokoban using Python, first try :relieved:
 sprkrd: max time around 1200ms... Maybe at some point I'll try to build a perfect minimal hash of the state using combinadics and store the visited states in a flat array, but for now this is good enough
 sprkrd: I'd like to get times below 1000ms in all the tests
 jacek: sokoban is optim?
 sprkrd: optim? what do you mean?
 struct: its a puzzle
 sprkrd: ah, sorry, didn't understand the question at first
 jacek: how did you get the total time
 struct: I guess he just measured validators times
 sprkrd: time.time() before and after the call to the search function
 sprkrd: but for the tests, of course, no idea for the validators
 Westicles: One of the c++ solutions says:  highest run time on test 3-5 and it is 5-7 ms
 sprkrd: of course, in c++ i could further reduce the time, but I wanted to try Python for fun
 sprkrd: probably in C++ I could do it in about 0 ms :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: DomiKo has ported Abalone, interesting
 Astrobytes: Well, I think aCat made him, but interesting nonetheless :D
 struct: same size as yavalath
 struct: nice
 Astrobytes: I know of the game but I have zero experience with it. Seems interesting
 struct: I never played it
 struct: Dont know the rules
 Astrobytes: Rules in the statement :P
 DomiKo: struct we have looked at yavalath when making that one 
 struct: :grimacing:
 struct: sorry
 struct: yavalath code is so bad :D
 DomiKo: hexes without one line&#160;:( 
 Westicles: More exciting bitboard mcts conversation for years to come
 DomiKo: yeah abalone isn't easy one 
 Astrobytes: Are you thinking of different starting positions DomiKo
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: For instance, Belgian Daisy
 Astrobytes: German Daisy etc
 Astrobytes: iirc they minimise draws and P1 advantage
 DomiKo: we have one big difference with original game, the draw
 DomiKo: and we don't know if we broke the game or not
 struct: I see
 Astrobytes: Try the different starting configurations I mentioned
 struct: So you are worried that players will go defensive after capturing N marbles?
 Astrobytes: Seems so
 DomiKo: we could have broken some strategies with capturing the center  too
 Astrobytes: This is going to need very thorough testing then
 DomiKo: we can wait :D 
 Astrobytes: Since it's not a straightforward port it will take time
 Astrobytes: *straight port
 DomiKo: yes, we also have to think about the "beginner-friendly" thing
 Astrobytes: For that, you only really need valid moves as input
 Astrobytes: imo
 Astrobytes: 2 leagues, first boss beats random bots
 struct: or just add random as possible output
 Astrobytes: Yep, that too. Either way, first boss must beat random
 struct: also number of possible actions would be nice to have maybe
 struct: at least to debug
 Astrobytes: yeah, sure
 struct: just the number, you dont need to give all the actions
 Astrobytes: for movegen testing
 DomiKo: good ideas
 jacek: someone will be delighted at yet another hex game
 AntiSquid: what hex game?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6957d71b3855419b49a91d026af0603b4179">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6957d71b3855419b49a91d026af0603b4179</a>
 AntiSquid: depends on the implementation / type of game imo
 AntiSquid: i think there could be good hex games, if the input and the game itself favours  easy representations not only favouring a very specific work-around
 AntiSquid: abalone? immediately thought about the food ... gross T_T
 jacek: interesting <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/towzeur/gym-abalone#Object-of-the-game">https://github.com/towzeur/gym-abalone#Object-of-the-game</a>
 AntiSquid: heh, good point westicles, maybe it's something game creators should consider, but then again it's the top dog and you can "transition" it into alphazero sort of, not much else you can do on this site either since it doesn't support ML, so basically yes just brush up your MCTS for the long run
 AntiSquid: one reason more i like Fireworks
 Astrobytes: abalone is nice sliced real thin
 Astrobytes: they're usually called ormers over here though, depending who you buy from/where you work
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt; .. i was using the collide function from the refereee init instead of the one used while playing  :flip:
 Astrobytes: what game KiwiTae?
 Astrobytes: also hi o/
 KiwiTae: heyy :D 
 KiwiTae: pcr ~ 
 Astrobytes: ahhh
 KiwiTae: theres like nothing to sim in it i managed to fucked it up ~
 KiwiTae: sorry
 KiwiTae: bad words :3
 Astrobytes: lol all good
 KiwiTae: :kissing_heart: 
 Astrobytes: context is important, without context I disapprove :D
 KiwiTae: I am getting crazy been stuck in bed since june 11th ~
 Astrobytes: covid?
 KiwiTae: not yet &gt;&lt; I got double surgery on left ankle 
 Astrobytes: Ouch. Running injury?
 KiwiTae: gonna laugh its badminton and hiking injuries ~
 Astrobytes: That's a fully acceptable way to get injuries!
 Astrobytes: I broke my left wrist and hand crushing garlic ffs :D
 KiwiTae: i was having chronic pain for a few years turned out I was missing 2ligaments and misplaced bones
 Astrobytes: oof
 Astrobytes: So it's corrective surgery in this case. I hope it gives you some relief dude, that must've been pretty crap
 Astrobytes: And take more care in future!
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm out for tonight. See ya's tomorrow&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: nightnighhth girl! :D
 KiwiTae: its movie time ~
 ShakeDatBunda: rah man imported re
 ShakeDatBunda: fuck i was thinking of using re but then i was like that might make it longer
 KiwiTae: swap to js no need to import 
 AmirSommer: helllo
 AmirSommer: come join me in clash of code!
 KiwiTae: #clash
 Mundgus: How can I set main example when I create a new CoC? (I don't want to change the order of the test cases)

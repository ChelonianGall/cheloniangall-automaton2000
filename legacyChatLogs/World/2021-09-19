 jacek: good morning
 Husoski: @DEIZ21 Follow the quest map.  Scroll down on the home screen and you'll see the paths.  That's the route to certifications.
 Husoski: oops.  just replied to a 9 hour old message.
 Husoski: again.

 rame3116: Hello everyone, am I the only one who has the RUN button that does not work?
 rame3116: It just loops forever
 Uljahn: where's that button?
 rame3116: In the exercices
 rame3116: Activity-Learn
 rame3116: I'm practicing PHP but it doesn't work anywhere
 rame3116: I've tried different PCs, internet connexions and navigators
 Uljahn: yep, same for me, guess the problem is with tech.io
 rame3116: thanks!
 jacek: a helpful mod o.O

 Wontonimo: no spamming, be nice, talk about coding or coding game, (mostly) stay on topic
 jacek: Wontonimod
 Wontonimo: you know it
 jacek: are you working on something on CG?
 Wontonimo: tron
 jacek: mhm
 Wontonimo: finally fixed my floodfill 
 nulte: do you do them separately Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: the floodfill is synchronous on 1 map, not 1 map per player
 Wontonimo: is that what you are asking nulte&#160;?
 nulte: yes
 Wontonimo: are you planning on getting into Tron&#160;?
 Astrobytes: nulte is resurrected eh
 Wontonimo: then died again
 Astrobytes: here :taco:
 Astrobytes: Small consolation prize
 Wontonimo: thanks.  nulte's death isn't really hitting me hard, but I'll not refuse a taco
 Astrobytes: I was looking for a frisbee emoji but there isn't one
 Wontonimo: I never found the actual bug in my code but I found a previous version that didn't have the bug.  It was before I switched to a custom written queue, so that may have been it
 Wontonimo: Now to add minimax
 Astrobytes: custom Q is faster for a start
 Astrobytes: Oh I misread
 Wontonimo: my custom queue was 600 pre-allocated elements.  in hindsight, it probably doesn't handle collision expansions, and needs to be 4 times that size
 Wontonimo: but it did loop around, so, it should have been okay
 Astrobytes: debug that thoroughly
 Astrobytes: It's easy to fook it up
 Bassel: Hey guys
 Astrobytes: Hello
 Wontonimo: :wave: Bassel
 Astrobytes: Wondering what to work on this week
 Wontonimo: Bassel, *everyone* is competing in Tron&#160;;) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tron-battle">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/tron-battle</a> , come join us
 Astrobytes: Had a couple of weeks doing very little on CG, need to work on an official multi
 Wontonimo: I had a couple months of very little
 Astrobytes: It happens
 Wontonimo: my score in Tron is bugging me now
 Astrobytes: Just go all in
 Astrobytes: I did that for FB after Sogeti, then Tron after
 Astrobytes: *all in when you have the time I mean
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's my current path.  on that path is to make sure my floodfill is working like it should
 Astrobytes: make a quick visualiser
 Wontonimo: ah.  that much all-in
 Astrobytes: Well it can be text output
 Astrobytes: just make sure it's right
 Wontonimo: of course
 Wontonimo: high performance computing using a buggy sim is just running fast in the wrong direction
 Astrobytes: Yes, it is&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: 3rd place gold before stabilization ... and ... 3rd place after.  cool
 Wontonimo: okay, I think this version of floodfill is good.
 Wontonimo: Looking at replays it is doing what i expect it to do
 Wontonimo: onto minimax
 nulte: nice
 Wontonimo: thanks
 Wontonimo: what multis are you interested in nulte&#160;?
 nulte: so its currently just 1 ply?
 nulte: im struct
 Wontonimo: oh.  i see
 Wontonimo: i knew that at some point, but forgot till you reminded me
 Wontonimo: it is just straight up synchronous flood fill.
 Wontonimo: the scoring is myarea * 100 - sum(enemyareas)
 nulte: but with voronoi?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 YurkovAS: nulte thanks for help with c4! I'm did smart rollouts, bot improved.
 Astrobytes: nice one Wontonimo&#160;:+1:
 nulte: nice YurkovAS
 nulte: and np
 Bassel: Is this tron battle?
 Astrobytes: Yea
 Astrobytes: h
 Wontonimo: nulte, you have no skills&#160;! (*according to CG)
 Wontonimo: i feel kinda silly now not remembering.  oh well
 Astrobytes: It's OK, I think even struct forgot nulte at some point lol
 nulte: i never finished quest map here
 nulte: This account is cursed
 nulte: chat keeps crashing randomly
 nulte: I lose all the messages 
 Astrobytes: delete
 Astrobytes: New account: Netuno
 Illedan: Yo
 MSmits: Yo
 Astrobytes: Yo
 nulte: yo
 Illedan: I crushed 4-10 so badly in FB that I can't use their scores to get top2 again -.-
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: you wore out the stepping stone
 nulte: Illedan i have  pro tip for that
 Illedan: Ok?
 nulte: spam submit a weaker bot to boost their elo
 nulte: :D
 Illedan: I had some timebomb in mind
 Illedan: after 5 min, start crashing 
 nulte: that works too
 Illedan: But only crash when I track a n00b enemy
 nulte: 50% chance to crash after 5 min
 nulte: so you can still get elo
 Illedan: I had 50% vs top2 and &gt; 75% vs the rest. Still 3rd -.-
 Illedan: Too few games
 MSmits: if you have even 51% vs top 2 it's possible with spam
 Illedan: Not when I push everyone else more down :P
 MSmits: why is that a problem?
 Illedan: I lose so damn much when I lose vs them
 MSmits: you should still pull nr 2 down
 MSmits: because when you lose so damn much, your rating is low
 MSmits: and he loses more
 MSmits: as long as you have 50+% and you get games, nothing can stop you
 MSmits: unless of course you push some of those other guys to nr 2
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: I wish I had a timebank for FB
 Illedan: As 90&#160;% of turns are easy choices. Then I could use a bunch of time on those 2 rounds where everything crashes
 Armangh: can someone help me with writing a turnery operation in java?
 Armangh: nevermind got it right thanks
 nulte: should be like something like
 nulte: condtion&#160;? true&#160;: false
 Wontonimo: so, who's joining the fall contest?  I suck at escape rooms irl.  Anyone want a half decent coder but otherwise dead weight on their team?
 Wontonimo: (I'm really selling this)
 Armangh: I just joined and have started the Coder Strikes Back AI exercise. I don't seem to properly understand how it works and whats required. Anyone free to give me a hand?
 Armangh: Got it, thanks
 nulte: have you done the other escapes Wontonimo?
 liuxin: ä¸­å›½NB
 nulte: grats on legend
 Wontonimo: nope, haven't done escapes other than irl
 Wontonimo: thanks for the grats
 Wontonimo: it was by the skin of my teeth, with only a 0.13 points of TS
 nulte: I cant promise anything yet, I still dont know the date
 nulte: and hour
 Wontonimo: np
 nulte: how long until promotion?
 Wontonimo: 1 hour
 Wontonimo: so, after removing the bugs from floodfill, and adding minimax (not alphamax or nega) for 1 depth search.  that's what worked.  lots of bugs
 nulte: hm I should try minimax
 nulte: but you only do 2 players right?
 Wontonimo: the minimax is "everyone for themselves"
 Wontonimo: and it's all players
 nulte: hmm never did multiple player minimax
 nulte: 3+
 Wontonimo: every player chooses it's best outcome based on&#160;:controlled area * 100 - others area
 Wontonimo: it's just what i did.  it only scraped by, so there has to be better algos
 Wontonimo: I've never done 3+ minimax before either
 Wontonimo: I changed my floodfill to instead return the area for each player instead of a score.  The eval within the minimax uses the returned area to calculate personalized score
 nulte: I must try it
 nulte: when I fix the bugs
 Wontonimo: what bugs do you have left?
 nulte: on my new code I have a bug
 nulte: on 4 players
 nulte: game always crashes on 2nd turn
 nulte: But I havent looked into it yet
 Wontonimo: with minimax, your scoring system using "area controlled" seems to work better
 nulte: Ill try it this week probably
 Wontonimo: cool
 nulte: im out for the night
 nulte: gn
 Wontonimo: gn and gl
 nulte: thanks
 Thorcode: How can i input the color in Smash the code
 Wontonimo: what do you mean?
 Thorcode: the color of the block
 Thorcode: to build combo
 Wontonimo: what level are you?
 Thorcode: 10
 Wontonimo: league i mean
 Thorcode: wood 2
 Wontonimo: does the default code do anything?
 Thorcode: I'm trying to build combo and count the row
 Wontonimo: ah
 Thorcode: nope
 Thorcode: the default code stupid
 Thorcode: I just print the 0 line
 Thorcode: and i get lost about 6 round
 Wontonimo: well, how about drop the block in the column according to its color
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: I'm trying that
 Thorcode: but I couldn't input the color of the bloc
 Wontonimo: what language?
 Thorcode: python 3
 Thorcode: I just random the number :grin: from 1-5
 Wontonimo: do you see this linecolor_a, color_b = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
 Wontonimo: that gets the colors for you
 Thorcode: how to do it
 Wontonimo: it's already there
 Thorcode: like if color_a == "red"
 Wontonimo: if (color_a = 1)
 Thorcode: i know
 Wontonimo: if your read the game description, it tells you.  colors are an integer from 1 to 5
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I'm stupid
 Thorcode: thanks wontonimo
 Wontonimo: np Thorcode&#160;!
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87d00b65-6939-4c26-8d4e-0dce7fbfb0e3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/87d00b65-6939-4c26-8d4e-0dce7fbfb0e3</a>
 Thorcode: How could I mis that line
 Wontonimo: you'll notice that the variable color_a and color_b are being overwritten 8 times
 Wontonimo: you'll probably want to put those in an array or something
 Thorcode: An integer from 1 to 5 for a colored block.
 Thorcode: but i missed this line
 Thorcode: so I get loss
 Wontonimo: because the only one you really need is the first one until you implement a search
 Thorcode: I forgot to look carefully at the game input
 Thorcode: well it worked
 Thorcode: thanks
 Wontonimo: what worked?
 Thorcode: my code
 Wontonimo: cool
 Thorcode: I think i'm gona get to wood 1 soon
 Thorcode: I want to ask you only 1 more thing
 Thorcode: is how to buy item in botters of the galaxy
 Wontonimo: don't limit yourself
 Thorcode: uh
 Wontonimo: to just 1 question
 Thorcode: ok
 Wontonimo: let me look, i haven't played that for a long time
 Wontonimo: just print the command"BUY [itemname]"
 Thorcode: I know but the itemname how can i get it
 Wontonimo: scroll down in the description on the left 
 Thorcode: I tried to buy like buy [health] but it doesn't work for me
 Wontonimo: if you look at the default code it is there.  look at the lines after 
 Wontonimo: that reads in all the items for you
 Wontonimo: but it overwrites the values each time through that loop
 Thorcode: oh thanks
 Wontonimo: you need to put all that into a data structure
 Wontonimo: no problem!
 Thorcode: like use dictionary?
 Wontonimo: yeah, or simply a list
 Wontonimo: I have a "ItemClass", and make a list of items
 Wontonimo: when i need one I iterate over the list to fine the best matching items for the situation
 Thorcode: I should read the input and the default code more carefully
 Wontonimo: i have to admit that I do a really bad job at it, seeing as I'm still low in the ranks
 Thorcode: yeah You are in bronze league
 Thorcode: but i'm in wood 3
 Wontonimo: something that really helps me in the wood leagues is to look at replays of the top players in my league and the mid level players in the league one above
 Wontonimo: look for patterns and simple strategies to copy
 Wontonimo: in the higher leagues it's not as simple, but it's really useful to do in the lower leagues
 Thorcode: wait in the smash the code the integer from 1-5 I think it is randomly and the color block doesn't fit to any of the integer
 Thorcode: if c==1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e6dc576-0933-440d-b269-e3b57428a780">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e6dc576-0933-440d-b269-e3b57428a780</a>
 Thorcode: I used this code but it print
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/581745148">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/581745148</a>
 Thorcode: c = color_1
 Wontonimo: why not just do print(color_1)?
 Wontonimo: instead of all that if/else
 Thorcode: Ä‘ie
 Wontonimo: die?
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/581745455">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/581745455</a>
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: wrong
 Thorcode: lose too
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/581745518">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/581745518</a>
 Thorcode: 1 â‰¤ colorA â‰¤ 5
 Thorcode: gosh colorA like random number
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: paste your code, i'll help you with your bug
 Thorcode: while True: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1120cda9-e2dd-4415-8114-3c230fa3536f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1120cda9-e2dd-4415-8114-3c230fa3536f</a>
 Thorcode: I think it do exactly the same as random
 Wontonimo: normally pasting code is a big no, but this is wood 3 code, so it's okay
 Wontonimo: you see these two linesfor i in range(8):
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: I changed color_a and b
 Wontonimo: remember I said that c,o get overwritten every time around that loop and you need to put it in a list or something
 Wontonimo: you didn't
 Wontonimo: you are looking at the LAST c,o
 Wontonimo: you need the FIRST c,o
 Thorcode: the print?
 Thorcode: c=o
 Thorcode: colorA is always equal to colorB.
 Wontonimo: no, that's not the point
 Wontonimo: look at this code
 Wontonimo: a = 33for i in range(8):
 Wontonimo: what is the value of a?
 Thorcode: 33
 Wontonimo: no.  a = 7
 Thorcode: how
 Wontonimo: do you know what"for i in range(8):" does?
 Thorcode: yeah
 Wontonimo: what does it do?
 Thorcode: i is a number in 1-8
 Thorcode: so?
 Wontonimo: 0-7
 Wontonimo: but yeah
 Wontonimo: and how about the next line"    a = i"
 Wontonimo: what does that do?
 Thorcode: change the value of a
 Thorcode: of course
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6e50f70-6b3e-4dff-ade5-c99540a8e927">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6e50f70-6b3e-4dff-ade5-c99540a8e927</a>
 Thorcode: why i checked your code in visual terminal i doesn't work
 Thorcode: i added print(a)
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: right
 Thorcode: but how i is in range 0-7
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/973c7204-0b7b-4355-92cc-288833c00a4d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/973c7204-0b7b-4355-92cc-288833c00a4d</a>
 Wontonimo: it works
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: but how a can be 7
 Wontonimo: "but how i is in range 0-7"because that is want "range(8)" means
 Wontonimo: 8 numbers, starting with 0
 Thorcode: yeah
 Wontonimo: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
 Wontonimo: that's 8 numbers
 Thorcode: so why i pick 7
 Thorcode: it
 Wontonimo: it didn't
 Thorcode: a = 7
 Wontonimo: it picked EVERY number and assigned a =0, then a=1, then a=2 ...
 Wontonimo: finally .... after a long while
 Wontonimo: it set a=7
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: but when i delete that line my code didn't work
 Wontonimo: that's right.  you need to store it in an array
 Wontonimo: consider this code
 Thorcode: array again sad moment
 Wontonimo: a = [33]
 Wontonimo: for i in range(8):
 Wontonimo:     a.append(i)
 Wontonimo: print(a)
 Wontonimo: now what do you get?
 Thorcode: 33?
 Thorcode: and the 0-7
 Wontonimo: did you put that in python and try it?
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: append change it
 Thorcode: but i didn't think that it change all the array
 Wontonimo: you may find this site <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a> really helpful to get a better understanding of arrays and other data in python
 Thorcode: well thanks wontonimo
 Thorcode: I get it
 Wontonimo: there is another app called something like Mimo that has python quizes
 Wontonimo: (don't get the paid version)
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: I know mim
 Thorcode: mimo
 Thorcode: I use crack
 Wontonimo: i send you a private message
 Wontonimo: i'm gonna log off in a sec

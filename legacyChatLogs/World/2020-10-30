 Ak47aman: Hello World
 phantom1299: Hello Ak47aman, I'm World 
 Ak47aman: thank phantom1299 for your response
 phantom1299: ur welcome&#160;:)
 Chitchen: Hahaha
 Chitchen: It's funny seeing what conversations go on here.
 FredericRANDRIANARIVONY: hello everyone
 LukeCloudwalker: Hey
 Tom.py: hi
 LukeCloudwalker: Has anyone done the ASCII Art problem? What is the expected output on the last test? Meaning what should I do with '@'? It doesn't seem to specify in the rules...
 LukeCloudwalker: Nevermind, I am supposed to use the questionmark
 RromanSmoll: funny you shoulf ask this question)) I am staring in Ascii art exercise right now with no idea where to start)
 The_Auditor: Good Morning everyone&#160;! including Automaton2000&#160;!
 Automaton2000: i submitted a bot that can be done in python
 SPDene: Automaton2000&#160;: what's a "bot"?
 Automaton2000: its not really a fan of it
 eulerscheZahl: good afternoon to you as well
 Zenoscave: moin
 Astrobytes: Och aye the noo
 eulerscheZahl: ohai
 Zenoscave: おはようございます。
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl Do you sim c4l?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/code4life-feedback-strategy/2835/21">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/code4life-feedback-strategy/2835/21</a>
 Zenoscave: Would you care to critique a design for c# sim in a bit? My code layout is weak
 eulerscheZahl: did you read my post mortem yet?
 Zenoscave: several times
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 eulerscheZahl: let me pull up my code and try to remember what I did
 Zenoscave: It doesn't need to be c4l I'm just trying to get a general template or pattern down for sim in C#
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the kind of search. my code layout is different for beam search vs that monte carlo thing i was doing in C4L
 Zenoscave: Monte Carlo is what I'm aiming for
 Zenoscave: Do you pass a game state object around?
 eulerscheZahl: I have a function Simulate that I call as long as I have time remaining
 eulerscheZahl: and I pass the initial state to it
 eulerscheZahl: as a copy so I can modify it
 eulerscheZahl: for C4L I do completely random simulations. In other games (especially multi-agent) I try to modify an existing solution instead
 Zenoscave: Ok that should be enough to work with
 Zenoscave: have you worked with ref much in C#?
 eulerscheZahl: rarely
 eulerscheZahl: if you pass objects, you pass by ref anyways
 eulerscheZahl: and such things asref int myNumber
 eulerscheZahl: meh, I rarely have use for that
 eulerscheZahl: afk, cat time
 Patela: Hey, anyone can help me understand why Am i failing test 6 of ascii art? (java)
 Zenoscave: Meow meow euler. thank you
 Zenoscave: What is test  6? I only see 5 Patela
 Patela: when you press "submit" 2 more show up i think
 Patela: and i fail on the number 6
 Zenoscave: Ah those are validators. they are not available publicly. (To stop hard-coding solutions)
 Uljahn: validator 6 is called "Test full alphabet in CAPS..."
 Uljahn: kinda hint
 Zenoscave: That's as much as we can give though. Uljahn is correct
 Patela: how do i test the code tho?
 Zenoscave: You can't only on submit
 Astrobytes: Make a custom test case with all caps
 Patela: how?
 Zenoscave: click custom next to test cases
 Astrobytes: Settings on left, Expert mode (if not already) then what Zeno said
 Zenoscave: if it doesn't show that option you need to click settings on the left and enable expert mod
 Patela: ohh thank you!
 Astrobytes: Hi Zenscave &amp; Uljahn btw
 Zenoscave: Beat me to it
 Zenoscave: Meow
 Uljahn: to enable custom test tab switch the mode to expert in the settings on the left
 Zenoscave: hi Astro and Uljahn
 Uljahn: pewpew
 Patela: should i write the full alphabet?
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew
 Patela: in caps i mean
 Patela: dear god
 Patela: i forgot one letter of the alphabet
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Patela: is there a better way to do an arrawy of the alphabet&#160;? ( I'm kinda rusty)
 Astrobytes: Well, technically you don't even need an array with the alphabet
 Astrobytes: I gotta go for now, but think about ASCII and how you might go about using it to your advantage here
 BiMathAx: Who know Franz Ferdinand&#160;?
 Clagus: Franz! One of my favourites in my 20ties.

 tekki: hi world
 tekki: something is going wrong?
 tekki: if so don't call me ask AutomatonNN&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: and it's basically the same thing
 Zenoscave: euler you still here?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: watched a southpark episode. back now
 Lachrymosa: Hey CG, quick hypothetical.  If I wanted to make a wiring diagram that let me click on a wire and it would highlight where that wire flowed to through the system.  What types of solutions exist, short of coding it from scratch?
 AndrewWellington: hi
 AndrewWellington: i'm new to coding 
 AndrewWellington: but I have a little experience with javascript, if anyone is down to help me with some basics I would greatly appreciate it
 AndrewWellington: or can guide me to a place that could help me
 eulerscheZahl: for drawing these plans I got to know eplan. but was disappointed about it. e.g. the lack of simulating that kind of stuff
 eulerscheZahl: i can say that now, as Siemens and Siemens Energy are different companies and eplan is from the first while I work for the latter :P
 Zenoscave: I have a template MC Searcher finally. It builds and is ready for game specific dev
 Zenoscave: The search also is capable of other variations like beam or MCTS just did MC first
 eulerscheZahl: c4l isn't the easiest one to get it working
 eulerscheZahl: i was close to giving up
 Zenoscave: Due to the time move diffs?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. and late rewards
 Zenoscave: Right
 eulerscheZahl: you score at the laboratory but have to take a few steps before
 Zenoscave: What search depth did you end up doing? r if full depth howmany rollouts?
 eulerscheZahl: if you score wrongly, you will analyze the first sample, then see that you can complete it, go to molecules and then lab
 eulerscheZahl: random, about 5k plans iirc
 Zenoscave: ok. good to know
 eulerscheZahl: a plan means visiting 3 devices
 eulerscheZahl: and random choices at the molecules
 eulerscheZahl: weighted random, depending on my own samples
 eulerscheZahl: and a bonus if blocking the opponent
 Zenoscave: interesting
 Zenoscave: I was goindg to just due full random current state possible actions
 Zenoscave: could probably adjust weights in sample too
 eulerscheZahl: full random is bad for picking molecules. takes too long to find a good one
 eulerscheZahl: i also have weighted paths. e.g. from the molecules i prefer going to the lab
 Zenoscave: and each device you do multiple actions if available?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and stop randomly too
 Zenoscave: why stop randomly?
 eulerscheZahl: because i don't know how many molecules i want to take
 eulerscheZahl: i only see that when i simulate the lab
 Zenoscave: Ah
 eulerscheZahl: told you: C4L is a pain for Monte Carlo :D
 Zenoscave: Then why did you chose MC?
 eulerscheZahl: i also ran a big fat MC to tune the scoring parameters
 eulerscheZahl: because MC seemed viable to me. not easy but still doable
 eulerscheZahl: no way i'm willing to write a huge if-else of that
 Zenoscave: didn't you end up with a massive number of ifs anyways?
 eulerscheZahl: 125 including comments :D
 eulerscheZahl: my bot still has some funny actions that i don't understand
 Zenoscave: lol
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/432144883">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/432144883</a>
 eulerscheZahl: check the last few turns
 eulerscheZahl: that useless intermediate stop
 eulerscheZahl: and i do that all the time when I can't get anything done before the end. No harm but I don't understand it :D
 Zenoscave: yeah that is weird
 emy1994: HELLO
 Zrys:   Hi
 Lachrymosa: Euler, I am currently working on your minesweeper puzzle lol
 eulerscheZahl: hm, frame 86 in that replay above was stupid :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: hi Lachrymosa. Glad you give it a try&#160;:)
 Lachrymosa: Yea hopefully I'll make it work today
 NitMpez: welp euler just made me feel bad about my 941 line c4l with comments
 eulerscheZahl: i'm around 1.3k lines
 NitMpez: oh, i thought you said 125 lines of code... 
 Shahmuizz: can anyone tell me how to sort without using array in c++?
 NitMpez: apparently someone bumped my decision tree into legend... was nice of them
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hvRrhhzpZc&amp;ab_channel=EricRosen">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hvRrhhzpZc&amp;ab_channel=EricRosen</a>this is getting too far
 NitMpez: that just hurts my head
 eulerscheZahl: we should port it to CG. just for reCurse's reaction
 NitMpez: is there any good tutorials on basically running your sim, then running it for enemy, then using there position, and reevaluating with sim with their new positions.
 Astrobytes: dear god
 yassineH: that sounds like fun
 NitMpez: cause i swear any time i try to predict any movement... my sims get worse
 arthurvergacas: gosh
 arthurvergacas: this ui
 arthurvergacas: is so
 arthurvergacas: weird
 arthurvergacas: i spend like 15 minutes just figuring out what I should do
 wlesavo: fog onitama :smiley:
 Astrobytes: Fogitama
 eulerscheZahl: i had a game in mind that's heavily fog oriented
 eulerscheZahl: but discarded the idea, i don't think you would like it
 eulerscheZahl: you have to find a path in a maze and reach the opponent start location. but you are blindfolded
 eulerscheZahl: you can produce sound which travels at a given speed
 eulerscheZahl: and wait for the echo to come a few turns later
 eulerscheZahl: so you can calculate the distance to each wall
 eulerscheZahl: I even had a title in mind: NaNNaNNaNNaN Batman
 LastRick: i like it, more map puzzles please
 Astrobytes: that title :D
 Lachrymosa: That does sound fun :3
 Astrobytes: It's very OOC-ish
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: had the idea before OOC
 eulerscheZahl: part of the reason why i discarded it
 Astrobytes: It would work fine, if the fog is central to the game as it is in this case (and OOC) it's cool. Just not when it's added to something like PacMan :P
 LastRick: Holey moly I beat Euler to a solution! I can retire from CG.
 eulerscheZahl: what are you talking about?
 Astrobytes: lol
 LastRick: Thank you everyone for distracting him long enough for me to solve the cardinal number puzzle.
 eulerscheZahl: i wasn't even aware of that existence :D
 LastRick: then my plan worked perfectly
 eulerscheZahl: link?
 LastRick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/nicholas-breakspeare-and-hugh-of-evesham">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/nicholas-breakspeare-and-hugh-of-evesham</a>
 eulerscheZahl: looks tedious
 eulerscheZahl: -2^64 ≤ Xi &lt; 2^64
 eulerscheZahl: what a poorly chosen limit
 eulerscheZahl: why not 2^62?
 eulerscheZahl: 63, typo
 LastRick: it is definitely tedious
 eulerscheZahl: and a faulty stub generator
 eulerscheZahl: reads int instead of long
 LastRick: my favorite part is when I got 2/3rds of the way through and had to switch from int to BigInt, I love going through and mindlessly switching dozens of those
 Skynse: me: wants to join a clash in timecaptcha: Im about to end this man's whole career
 eulerscheZahl: Unhandled exception. System.OverflowException: Value was either too large or too small for a UInt64.
 eulerscheZahl: i kinda saw that coming
 eulerscheZahl: 100% on submit. it's just that one number (-2^64) that makes me crash
 Astrobytes: bit of a fail that one
 eulerscheZahl: still i'm not happy about how the moderation process went there. 2^63 changes nothing about the puzzle but removes the need of BigIntegers
 eulerscheZahl: but am I pissed enough to complain on the forum?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I just read the comments and checked it out
 Astrobytes: Up to you. It seems like something that should've been picked up as not helpful during moderation as opposed to just being part of the puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle discussions share my concerns. including the crashing default code
 eulerscheZahl: screw it. it's anarchy now
 Astrobytes: Yeah, saw the forum post
 Astrobytes: Honestly.
 eulerscheZahl: dwarfie has a valid point about string manipulation being viable. i'll change the stub at least
 Astrobytes: Doesn't change the fact that a lot of contributions are slipping through without due care and attention in the approval process (again)
 eulerscheZahl: yes. thumbs up for the few users how try to keep it clean and prevent the worst
 eulerscheZahl: I gave up and just spam my own brainfarts instead :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, absolutely.lol, keep brainfarting!
 eulerscheZahl: not before the next contest. my next one will get complicated if i really decide to go for it
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, not long til the contest now
 eulerscheZahl: hype
 eulerscheZahl: also i'm trying the topcoder marathon
 eulerscheZahl: did a bit of quick coding today, will really start tomorrow
 Astrobytes: I saw someone post about that, might have been you
 eulerscheZahl: it was
 eulerscheZahl: you have a final table from a soccer tournament (goals scored+received, points gathered)and you have to guess the score for each match
 Astrobytes: lol, you got this one for sure&#160;:)
 ParticleBeam: Dots and Boxes proving tricky
 Zenoscave: I completely forgot about enemy movement in my Template. It always assumes a game is single player...
 Zenoscave: need a better multiplayer version...
 Astrobytes: Pass in who's turn it is to your playTurn method, iterate through players... multiple approaches
 Astrobytes: *whose
 AntiSquid: dots and boxes is annoying to structure imo . i find my implementation not "clean"
 ParticleBeam: I have a rather clumsy structure and its very expensive when trying to run simulations.
 AntiSquid: i didn't add in yet all the tricks. :P
 DesmondW: .
 Zenoscave: Anti when did you hit lvl50
 Zenoscave: gz
 vtenneke: Would anyone have any pointers on Unfolding paper(very hard) I can pas 5/7 of the tests but I'm failing on the ones where you need to fold a lot. Currently using folding and floodfill so probably very inefficient but can't seem to wrap my mind around a formula.
 LastRick: I know I'm late to the discussion (had to go carve a pumpkin) but maybe there could be a setting that doesn't allow you to approve the post without solving it yourself? I know that's a question when you hit approve but maybe it should be mandatory
 LastRick: vtenneke: I haven't done this one yet but certainly there must be a math way to calculate the number of pieces (based on where the # are) for any given N. That's my guess.
 RohanasaurusRex: Wow level 50 is amazing lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: The "Unlocked certifications" part of the home screen lists certifications that you've already unlocked, correct?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Well duh
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: But it says I have "Artificial intelligence" gold level
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: "The developer knows how to develop an advanced AI: the AI optimizes its movements and adopts an appropriate strategy according to context..."
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I don't remember doing anything like that
 Scarfield: hover over the dots on the path: "Reach top 2% of the Bot Programming Leaderboard" to get gold
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Yea it says completed
 Scarfield: just above the yellow line it says how you got it
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Oh I didn't see the hat symbol next to it
 Scarfield: yea its a little weird
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I wonder why this whole quest map was introduced...
 jthemphill: I'm mid-gold in UTTT. The hot-spot in my code is in calculating available moves. I'm working on bit-boards and planning on returning a u128 representing the set of available moves I can take. Do you think bit-boards are an important optimization to do in UTTT or do you think I'm wasting my time?
 inoryy: it's very important, yes
 jthemphill: sweet, I shall carry on then
 RohanasaurusRex: So how long have you guys been programming for
 twitlydoof: yes

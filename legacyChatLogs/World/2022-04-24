 Ajaiy: struct Which league are you in btw
 struct: bronze
 struct: but i havent done much yet
 Ajaiy: oh ok
 Ajaiy: But I am not able to select your bot
 ClockSort: I've done a ton and I'm in Wood 2. Hah
 Ajaiy: It's not showing
 ClockSort: technically I haven't submitted anything though
 struct: its not top 1000
 Ajaiy: ok
 struct: I need to find some motivation&#160;:/
 Ajaiy: I can relate
 ClockSort: struct what do you think of this challenge compared to past ones?
 Ajaiy: I give up every single time when I try to make a game in Unity
 Ajaiy: idk what is making me do that
 Ajaiy: But pretty sure 75% of loss of motivation
 struct: ClockSort I'm not a big fan of it
 struct: but I don't like fog
 Ajaiy: Spring Challenge 2021 made me super confused
 Ajaiy: I reached till Silver
 Ajaiy: This year is better
 Ajaiy: for now
 JohnyDaison: Ajaiy have you set yourself small achievable goals or are you always trying work on everything from the start?
 Ajaiy: I mean, I could complete small games if my motivation didn't run out
 struct: not really JohnyDaison
 struct: Maybe i should do that
 Ajaiy: Each day, my motivation halves
 Ajaiy: But I HAVE recreated a nice version of Hangman in Python
 Ajaiy: Since it took 2 hours
 Enknable: The bright side is...you'll never lose your motivation!
 meowhurrhiss: The temptation doubles everyday, however.
 Kokoz: Good morning guys.
 Kokoz: What does shield do in the spring challenge?
 ravenbluedragon: Prevents spells
 Kokoz: only spells? it doesn't stop dmg?
 ddreams: you know there's a description right there
 Kokoz: yes, thank you
 Miki09: some1 using neural networks for spring 2022?
 Kokoz: I wish I knew how to do that&#160;:)
 Kokoz: Is there a way to challenge top ranked players?
 Miki09: yes
 Miki09: In ide
 Miki09: players
 therealbeef: in the IDE you can select bots (at the bottom of the screen) that will play against each other when you do play my code
 Kokoz: I cant find you
 therealbeef: only the top 1000 in your league are selectable
 therealbeef: and your own bots
 Kokoz: oh. Thank you&#160;:)
 Miki09: Do you think it's better to have 2 "defenders" and 1 "serial killer"(kills everything near him, camps in middle of map) or 2"defenders" and one guy who sends and shields spiders to enemy base?
 VizGhar: If he's succeful, then choice #2&#160;:)
 Miki09: ok&#160;:-)
 Kokoz: I am using the second method now and it doesnt work so good :S
 therealbeef: that kind of knowledge ('meta') usually changes over the course of a contest, as more advanced bots are submitted
 Kokoz: It is hard to progress with choice #2
 VizGhar: you are using it wrong then... check top player
 Miki09: I already checked him
 Miki09: Hes killing me 3:0 all the time&#160;:-(
 VizGhar: hmm easiest way is to stand near opponnent base. If mob is not targeting his base, send it there (control). If it's targetting the base shield him 
 VizGhar: should work for top 500 (my guess)
 Miki09: thanks for advice
 Kokoz: the top 1 guy just spam control on my heroes so they cant defend the base :D
 Miki09: Yeah
 Kokoz: cool
 Miki09: Even with 3 defenders I lost 1:0
 VizGhar: yup... I'm shielding if there is any mob near my base and opponent hero in range
 VizGhar: (dont check now, resubmit :P )
 VizGhar: win rate 11/11 so far... I've probably improved a tiny bit
 Miki09: congratulations :clap_tone3:
 Miki09: OMG u r 260
 VizGhar: hmm wind is incorrectly computed somehow for me... good to know
 VizGhar: 260?
 Kokoz: I think this challenge is too complicated for me (for my skills).. I will satisfy with mid bronze
 _NikJ: I'm shielding myself if there's an enemy within CONTROL range and  there's a spider nearBase, but so far I don't like how it's working
 Miki09: Kokoz dont satisfy with low!!!! Aim for at least silver
 therealbeef: the bronze boss will probably be chosen from mid-bronze, so if you're mid bronze now, you can reach silver too&#160;:)
 Isaax: hello
 Miki09: hi
 XxGrindingSheeshxX: when silver guys&#160;?
 Miki09: today
 Miki09: 5 pm cest
 Miki09: 3 pm gmt
 XxGrindingSheeshxX: ty, hate this offensive meta, hope there will be more defensive spells
 Isaax: why when i return 0  the function don't end?
 Isaax: def f(fathers, log): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/830c9934-2646-4306-a9bd-f3f3c4afbb5c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/830c9934-2646-4306-a9bd-f3f3c4afbb5c</a>
 Miki09: @VizGhar you from slovakia!!!
 Kokoz: Im 1867th now.. But I just don't know how to pregress. I get the idea but it is hard to implement it.. I am a beginner (or low intermediate) with not much experience
 Miki09: hmm
 Miki09: Ill watch your matches
 VizGhar: :D hej som
 Miki09: Já jsem z české republiky&#160;:-)
 VizGhar: :wave:
 Miki09: Kokoz first of all you have kinda lagged wind method
 Miki09: You need to check if the target is in range
 VizGhar: Hmm my bot didn't perform that well at the end&#160;:) I'm just enhancing defenders
 Miki09: Once you lost because you used wind and the enemy was out of range
 Ajaiy: Miki09 Can you just tell me how to see someone's plays?
 Ajaiy: I can only see Top 1000
 Miki09: Go to leaderboard
 Miki09: You cant see more than 1000
 Ajaiy: Sorry, I confused bots with plays
 Miki09: If youwant to watch specific player search it in the search bar
 Miki09: Oh ok
 Kokoz: yes Miki, I am aware but I dont know how to fix it.. I think I am checking for range..
 Miki09: Try euclidian
 Miki09: distance
 Miki09: math.sqrt((myx-hisx)**2+(myy-hisy)**2)
 Miki09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Euclidean-distance-in-tensorflow.png">https://www.tutorialexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Euclidean-distance-in-tensorflow.png</a>
 Kokoz: I am checking if the monster is close to my base AND if my heroes are in wind range
 Miki09: hmmm
 Miki09: What is ur distance formula?
 Ajaiy: Kokoz All your heroes are in the base, it might be better to send one of them to kill some spiders outside the base
 Kokoz: heroes x and y minus monster x and y &lt;= 1250
 Miki09: thats not gonna work
 Miki09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Euclidean-distance-in-tensorflow.png">https://www.tutorialexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Euclidean-distance-in-tensorflow.png</a> use this
 Kokoz: Ok, I will try that. And Ajaiy, I will try moving them little bit further away from base
 Miki09: Nice
 XxGrindingSheeshxX: if your hero's position is x = 0 and y = 0 and monster's pos is x = 1250 and y = 1250  your calculations are not gonna work cause the distance is bigger than 1250
 Kokoz: I see
 Kokoz: Thank you guys&#160;:)
 Miki09: np&#160;:-)
 XxGrindingSheeshxX: np
 FrozenYT: hello
 FrozenYT: im new here
 FrozenYT: im doing no spoon but im stuck
 Miki09: Where?
 FrozenYT: at the start
 FrozenYT: i dont understand it
 Miki09: hmm
 VizGhar: he is doint there is no spoon puzzle
 FrozenYT: yea
 FrozenYT: for python
 Miki09: For each node, you have to output his neighbors on right and down
 VizGhar: FrozenYT ask questions directly
 FrozenYT:&#160;??
 VizGhar: You didn't ask anything
 VizGhar: we cant help you
 FrozenYT: so should i say "Can you help me understand the 'there is no spoon puzzle'"?
 VizGhar: there is full description there... what you dont understand?
 Miki09: you have to go left to right
 Miki09: in every node
 Miki09: like reading a book
 Miki09: and for every node
 Miki09: you should print its neighbors
 Miki09: on right and down
 FrozenYT: ok
 FrozenYT: thank you
 Miki09: np
 VizGhar: I don't understand how does that help him o.O
 Kokoz: I think I fixed wind range issue..
 Miki09: NIce
 VizGhar: improved my bot falls 150 places :D that's life
 Miki09: lol
 avdg: I hope it's worth long term
 Gawei: Ma da shen are you there?
 avdg: Also, ranking can be a bit flaky
 Kokoz: So, by fixing wind issue and moving heroes forward I moved 450 places up in the ranking :3 
 Jerrasterix: I want to make a summer holiday project, involving astronomy... any ideas pls&#160;??
 LaurensD: how about taking a picture every hour for the whole summer of the sky and make a slice show out of it
 Jerrasterix: involving programming dude
 jacek: programming in bikini
 LaurensD: you can make your own raspberry pi code  :innocent:
 Jerrasterix: jacek :unamused:
 avdg: matrix math with stars, sky and time?
 Jerrasterix: cool, thanks avdg
 LarsVR: can we get out of bronze yet?
 Jerrasterix: nope only at 1pm EST
 Jerrasterix: *2pm
 JohnyDaison: Why is opening Silver delayed so much?
 therealbeef: this is normal. because they make the bronze boss out of one of the bots, they want people to have some time making decent bronze bots
 Uljahn: yes, there are no bosses prepared in advance for higher leagues, they want the bosses' difficulty to scale with average skill of participants to make legend league not too crowded and not too empty
 Enknable: Uljahn does that mean bosses are coded during the competition by Codingame to separate Leagues?
 therealbeef: they just copy a person's bot
 Enknable: oh
 Enknable: thats a better way lol
 therealbeef: sometimes you can see that when they copy a 'chatty' bot&#160;;)
 Enknable: so there's someone out there...getting pwned by themselves
 Enknable: what a world
 therealbeef: i think everyone above the chosen bot (including the bot that got copied) gets automatic promotion
 JohnyDaison: Why should they be pwned by themselves? Have you tried running your own code against itself? Perfectly symmetrical violence. Ended with a tie.
 Enknable: sounds like The Matrix.
 Enknable: I beat myself all the time.
 Enknable: &lt;3
 XxGrindingSheeshxX: if u use random values it can not be symmetrical violence xD
 JohnyDaison: TMI
 dinggg: Hey. When is Silver out and anyone know how many people get in straight away?
 Enknable: relax antiwonto
 Thorcode: ;taco:
 Thorcode: :taco:
 Thorcode: that bot slept
 Wontonimo: hi antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Wontonimo. I'm a bot :robot:
 Thorcode: how
 Enknable: dang
 Wontonimo: nope sleep, just not gonna taco during competition
 Thorcode: why
 Jerrasterix: hello antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Jerrasterix. I'm a bot :robot:
 Enknable: Wontonimo must be a positonimo
 Wontonimo: there is too much conversatiion about competition and there is some fear it will turn into spam
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: hola antiwonto
 Enknable: sup, antiwonto
 Wontonimo: only looks for "hi"&#160;;(  I should improve it to also allow hola, sup
 Thorcode: balls
 Thorcode: yeah
 Wontonimo: that's no longer a bad word
 Thorcode: that badword dead
 _NikJ: you bet your ass it isn't

 _NikJ: there we go, I triggered him :d
 Wontonimo: please don't try and trigger it
 Thorcode: new word?
 Enknable: there is no language anchor in that link btw
 Thorcode: what can you do antiwonto
 Enknable: no mention of "bad words"
 Thorcode: help
 Wontonimo: it really just says hi, looks for bad words, and clash of code links right now
 Thorcode: anti stop sending msg with "help"?
 Thorcode: that's goood
 _NikJ: I know it's been asked 22! times already, but when does the silver open for spring contest?
 _NikJ: Maybe you can add an answer to it Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: II think maybe 2pm 
 Wontonimo: EST
 _NikJ: that's in 10 hours?
 Thorcode: spring challenge like the botter of the galaxy
 Wontonimo: idk, i was just looking at the logs for an answer
 _NikJ: are you participating in the contest, Wontonimo?
 Thorcode: he is

 Thorcode: stop pls bro
 Enknable: just wanted to see
 Enknable: the switch statement
 Enknable:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: Enknable, consider that your warning.  No more
 Westicles: can you get into silver with only wind?  
 Thorcode: i think can
 Jerrasterix: I guess not
 Jerrasterix: literally every top 250 players are using control
 Wontonimo: my rank is 1385, and I only use wind
 Thorcode: some guy could defend with one knight and wind
 MACKEYTH: I'm not.
 Jerrasterix: nope you can't Thorcode
 Westicles: well, then how about only control?  I only want to learn one spell
 Wontonimo: lol
 avdg: I'm now 650 with only wind, got to less than 1800 yesterday without spell
 Aramang: i reckon you could get silver with shield and no wind
 Thorcode: yep
 Jerrasterix: lol, you can't with 1 
 Thorcode: only control can do that
 Enknable: Wontonimo affirmative :cop_tone1:
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup: :grin:
 _NikJ: Yesterday I was 80th and I only used wind. Today I'm using shield too and I'm 300th :D
 Enknable: Dang..megaman looks alot like the police lol
 Jerrasterix: _NikJ, that's bcoz others have started to use spells 
 _NikJ: Oh believe me, I've noticed :D
 _NikJ: Some are very aggressive
 Thorcode: wind and control is good to defend
 avdg: and I'm wondering why the ui doesn't display emoji's in comments
 Jerrasterix: yeah, I am struggling for a basic implementation lol
 avdg: it can do unicode, I saw Japanese text earlier today
 Jerrasterix: defending will only earn you a lose as you will not go out of the base 
 Jerrasterix: and will gather less wild mana
 Thorcode: how do control cost you?
 Enknable: jerrasterix thats true, but only if you don't lose yourself
 avdg: spells can eat mana I guess
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: every spell need 20 mana
 Jerrasterix: each spell 10 mana
 avdg: you can loose 30 each turn
 nalka0: Do you guys know if damages dealt by a hero outside of the base to a monster inside the base is wild mana or not?
 Thorcode: i'm thinking how to caculate time each round?
 avdg: I think any hit gains mana?
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: killing gain mana
 Jerrasterix: outside is wild mana nalka0
 nalka0: Yeah any hit gains mana but my question is about WILD mana
 Enknable: nalka0 if you're checking that deep
 Aramang: i don't know for sure i heard wild mana was based only on the hero position
 Enknable: damn u scary
 avdg: `In case of a tie, the player who gained the highest amount`
 avdg: `this is called wild mana`
 nalka0: Haha well i've been looking at the code in their repository but the only thing i found is a gainMana() that increases manaGainedOutsideOfBase without conditions
 Thorcode: i think i should start coding my own hero now
 Q12: "In case of a tie, the player who gained the highest amount of mana outside the radius of their base will win. this is called wild mana."
 avdg: Basically, wild mana is kinda like a hidden parameter unless you know about it
 avdg: It only cannot be more than mana
 nalka0: Exactly, that's why I ask cause I can't just figure it out with "debugging" ^^
 Thorcode: just make a var to store your mana to caculate wild mana i think
 pmor: wild mana is determined by the position of the hero
 Enknable: pmor I trust u for some reason
 pmor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L563">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L563</a>
 Enknable: might be  fear
 avdg: if my ai plans to maximize, I don't have to store wild mana I guess
 avdg: though the game provides the mana of each player each turn
 nalka0: @pmor yeah I was about to post it here but you've been faster ^^
 nalka0: And also, i've been wondering, is it normal that we're all stuck bronze?
 MACKEYTH: nalka0 wild mana is earned when your hero does damage while outside of the base
 MACKEYTH: Monster position doesn't matter
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: wild mana is earned just being outside of base
 Wontonimo: no combat needed
 Wontonimo: it is an incentive to not camp in your base, that's it
 yhyoxx: wild mana is mana earned outside the base 
 MACKEYTH: No, combat is required, if I'm reading the ref right. It's in the performCombat function
 avdg: combat just means getting your hero close to monster outside base
 nalka0: Wontonimo, do you pull this from reading the code or the knowledge you have of the game? Cuz indeed Referee.java line 570 makes it look like you're right but i'm not sure about fully understanding the code
 MACKEYTH: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java</a>
 MACKEYTH: line 563
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623410227">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623410227</a> wth was that in the last few turns
 nalka0: @mackeyth Yeah this line means only the hero matters, but it doesn't mean you don't need to deal damage
 JohnyDaison: nalka0, are we reading the same code? because to me it looks like you need to be in combat
 cegprakash: how opponent pushed about 10 monsters of distance 10000 units in 1 turn :O
 MACKEYTH: triple overlapping wind spells.
 avdg: in the worst case, 6 heroes can push a single entity
 cegprakash: I was only using MOVE commands avdg
 avdg: well, onsters, because you can't push your own team
 avdg: so 3 times 2200 =&gt; 6600
 cegprakash: SPELL WIND 17630 9000 means push to right bottom right
 cegprakash: why is it pushing to top left
 Aramang: it would probably be op to gather up  3 spiders and triple yeet them at the enemy
 avdg: pusing is relative to your hero, otherwise dunno?
 kovi: i saw some blue wind 0,0
 avdg: 6600 push with a base fog radius of 6000
 Jerrasterix: I try to accomodate SHIELD in my code , went from 1200 to 4100 :innocent:
 kovi: on that replay
 Aramang: 4100 means literally doesn't run right?
 Jerrasterix: nope, just last every battle somehow, without any error :sob:
 avdg: hmm I had a running bot at the back, it just didn't defend well yet
 Jerrasterix: I am reverting 
 AidasLau: please help on wood 2 league?
 avdg: you have a code problem or a problem solving problem?
 AidasLau: 2nd one
 Jerrasterix: just defend your base 
 avdg: probably best to share a replay?
 AidasLau: yes but how to write code for that?
 cegprakash: kovi I'm unable to reproduce that replay with same seed in IDE
 cegprakash: it's so weird how 10 units teleported 10000 distance
 Jerrasterix: just attack the spider nearest to your base
 kovi: your backwind helpem them a lot(pulling both mobs and enemies)
 JohnyDaison: cegprakash it seemed to me like one of your dudes also casted wind in the direction of your own base
 avdg: 6 * 2200 =&gt; 13200 =&gt; basically almost the whole map
 cegprakash: no JohnyDaison my base is 0,0 I am using spell on SPELL WIND 17630 9000
 cegprakash: and opponent has only 20 mana JohnyDaison
 Jerrasterix: nope your output shows that you are SPELL winding at 0 0 cegprakash
 cegprakash: even triple wind is not enough to teleport 10000 units
 Jerrasterix: your bot 0 does it 
 JohnyDaison: yep
 LaurensD: so... is the entityid consistent the whole game or can that be changed each loop?
 JohnyDaison: turn 198
 JohnyDaison: entity.Id is consistent
 AlMualem: is there a way to know where the cut off will be done for silver?
 LaurensD: Thanks :grimacing: I wonder what I'm doing wrong with the current refactor :P
 avdg: cut off silver: unknown, depends on which ai the moderators are picking
 AlMualem: maybe mid of bronze or top 1/3 i would say....lets see
 cegprakash: thx Jerrasterix JohnyDaison kovi fixed it
 Jerrasterix: np
 Aramang: treating all 3 heroes as one is kind of cool <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623417233">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623417233</a>
 AlMualem: For a weird reason i read Johny's name and i read Davidson :P
 AidasLau: help on wood 2
 AidasLau: how to write code
 Aramang: if you don't know how to write code start with a simpler problem
 Ajaiy: Wait, how do I know if someone pushed me with WIND?
 Thorcode: start with the starter kit then got to bronze fast
 benobab: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47d44bac-037e-4f7e-9b20-db2116af589a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47d44bac-037e-4f7e-9b20-db2116af589a</a>
 benobab: Hi, C++ here, for the spring challenge 2022, I'm timing out at 70/75ms, not 100ms. Am I the only one&#160;?
 dbf: 50 ms per turn is a limit
 Wontonimo: 50ms is the timout
 Jerrasterix: Ajaiy you can if you track the position, and telling if there was a sudden increase or decrease
 benobab: oh boy ok, it's writtent "Temps de réponse par tour ≤ 100ms" it's for both players?
 benobab: thanks
 Ajaiy: Ah I see
 Ajaiy: Thanks
 jacek: its 50ms
 dbdr: 50 ms in english is translated as 100 ms in french :D
 jacek: but time is slower in france
 Ajaiy: dbdr lol
 benobab: aha
 benobab: thanks for your replies, I'll let the creator know
 Ajaiy: It's like telling that ord in python is OrderedSet in some language
 benobab: of course it is :p
 SirLoxley: that awkward moment when you start programming an attacker, play against your version which doesn't do it ... and lose
 Ajaiy: I understand
 jordonez: Working on that right know, my attacker is useless hahaha
 jordonez: now*
 Ajaiy: What does it do though?
 jordonez: he is not a real threat so i lose because of wild mana
 AnyaForger: :kissing_heart:
 SirLoxley: my attacker actually works, only thing is ... he attacks my base lol
 jacek: insurance fraud?
 Aramang: your bot geined sentience and tried to commit suicide
 Ajaiy: SirLoxley Maybe you used the wrong coordinates for something
 Ajaiy: Like thinking your base is at 0, 0 when you are in red team
 Ajaiy: It happened in my code
 SirLoxley: of course I did&#160;:-)
 Ajaiy: Wait, really? :O
 Flash7: do someone know if an entity is protected from spell the turn it is used?
 SirLoxley: I actually made the effort to 'normalize' the game, i.e. if I happen to have the opposite base, I will make a note, and invert all input ... that way I can always assume my base is at 0, 0 (obviously has to be corrected during output)
 SirLoxley: Looks like there was an oversight&#160;:-)
 Enknable: r u using atan2?
 Ajaiy: Who?
 MACKEYTH: Flash7 no, shield takes effect the turn after it's cast
 Enknable: SirLoxley
 Flash7: alright ty
 SirLoxley: no. Cos/Sin nothing more fancy
 SirLoxley: It's ok, found it
 Ajaiy: Wait, why do you need it though?
 Alurian: How's everyone doing in the event?
 Ajaiy: Very well, thank you&#160;:)
 Alurian: Is there a way I can play against your bot?
 Ajaiy: Which league are you?
 Alurian: Bronze
 Ajaiy: I guess, no? Since I am not yet in Top 1000
 Ajaiy: I am tweaking my code
 Alurian: ooh ok 
 msumera: When is silver league opened?
 Alurian: in 5 hours if im correct
 Mortis_666: yeah! im at top 100 now
 Alurian: waiting for that
 Alurian: top 50 here :D
 Mortis_666: nice
 Alurian: waiting to improve until silver comes
 Mortis_666: same
 LaurensD: Is there any way to identify when a spider dies?
 IvesL: hp = 0?
 Alurian: not really, it's better to recreate a list each turn
 SirLoxley: dies or died?
 LaurensD: died
 IvesL: dieded
 SirLoxley: you don't get the ID in the next round
 Alurian: hp = 0 won't work seeing as they wont give spiders with 0 hp
 Aramang: you cant know where the emeny will move so its possibly unknown if they will hit it
 LaurensD: aww made it so I got a list that is re-used so that I still have the older locations when someone is out of bound
 IvesL: but if you dont have it in vision, its id disappears as well
 LaurensD: Yeah but it might be alive
 Th1nhNg0: I was test the stable-baselines3 library in python with snake environment and it look very promising
 Aramang: spider heads out of vision towards my base...my bot: this is fine
 SirLoxley: My attacker sucks&#160;:/ ... I won against my own but, but by Wild Mana only
 Alurian: you should just make sure atleast 1 guy is close to base
 Alurian: because you can see everything up to 5000 units away from base
 Alurian: I often win with wild mana
 JohnyDaison: LaurensD just put a tick limit on how long to store that Entity. If it hasn't been seen in a few ticks, it's probably gone.
 LaurensD: I sort of had that idea but it'll react unpredicatable because it assumes that spider is still there for a few turns
 DollarAkshay: When is Silver opening&#160;?
 IvesL: in 4 hours?
 DollarAkshay: TY
 LaurensD: later today
 DollarAkshay: I know it is today. wanted to know the exact time
 ACad: Hey how exactly do we win wild mana?
 LaurensD: should be kills outside your base
 Ajaiy: You kill spiders outside the base
 LaurensD: so in the 'wild'
 IvesL: you "damage" rather than kill
 IvesL: you dont have to kill
 ACad: Nice, do you know if you win more by damaging the ones with more health?
 ACad: Thank you a lot everyone
 KiwiTae: wildmana its smth new in bronze?
 IvesL: you get 1 damage per damage
 IvesL: 1mana*
 JohnyDaison: no, only difference is inside or outside the base, health doesn't matter
 ACad: ok thank you!
 IvesL: so each hero get 2mana from each monster in range each turn
 MACKEYTH: Yep
 Ekaon: What makes the difference after 600 rank to win the battle&#160;?
 IvesL: what do you mean
 MACKEYTH: Two things I found useful was switching the behavior of my attacker between attacking and hunting based on my mana
 avdg: my bot is now around 650 (now slightly better)
 avdg: also use more spells to put the opponent under more pressure
 MACKEYTH: and making aggressive used of wind to blow spiders into the enemy base
 Ekaon: This is rouggly what I do
 avdg: my ai is also already quite good in gathering mana
 Kokoz: if you use control on monster does it carry "is_controlled" untill something else happens, or "is_controlled" is 1 only while using the spell??
 avdg: though it doesn't hunt monsters, just defends the base for now
 Ekaon: I had 3 guys that can swtich of behaviour depending wich one is the nearest, one that farm mana, one to defend and one to attack. The attacker is also a farmer at the begening
 Ekaon: I found that using mana at begening is really a waste
 MACKEYTH: I just added some control-anticontrol logic to my bot. waiting to see if it helps
 avdg: Kokoz: control is applied once on the next turn I believe
 Ekaon: Mana is really a key from what I saw, we should use it wisely. For example, I shield my defender only if it was controlled once and helps me get some ranks more
 avdg: It's mentioned on "Action order for one turn"
 LaurensD: decided to test the bot agains @Alurian, lol that wasn't a good idea =P
 LaurensD: got butchered
 MACKEYTH: Hmph. literally no difference.
 Ekaon: Maybe you should do it more contextually&#160;?
 msumera: i just tested my bot against 4th and it won, hope it's not just luck
 Miki09: Submitting code
 Miki09: With REALLY big changes
 Miki09: Hope it'll be ok
 LaurensD: it's probably fine ~
 Miki09: idk
 Valdemar: Ekaon as far as I can see difference in wld mana gathering mainly. The better you move to beat several spiders at once the higher you will climb
 msumera: new bot, 40th -&gt; 13th&#160;:)
 Miki09: Omg
 Miki09: congratulations&#160;:-)
 msumera: thanks! I added some features like standing at the edge outside of base when defending just to get wild mana&#160;;)
 Miki09: O.O
 Miki09: Can anyone please tell me when will the silver league open,
 Miki09: Many people say many different things
 msumera: i heard it's in 3.5 hours, but not sure
 Miki09: yeah me too
 Miki09: but I also heard its in 7.5 hours
 Miki09: so idk...
 _NikJ: I also heard that they need to add it manually and they won't do it today because it's sunday D:
 _NikJ: So nobody really knows when
 Miki09: hmmm.....
 AlMualem: it is 2pm GMT
 SirLoxley: When my hero gets mind controlled and casts a shield on himself in the same turn ... why is there no shield on him in the next turn? I cannot find it in the rules
 msumera: if the hero is controlled, he cannot do anything
 Obult: silver opens in 4.5hrs
 _NikJ: are there any new rules in silver? do we have that info?
 DollarAkshay: what happens if wind is used on the edge of the map&#160;?
 Uljahn: no new rules expected in silver, bronze rules should be final
 KiwiTae: SirLoxley control happens before shielding
 Miki09: oh ok
 Ajaiy: Wow, this year, the rules are super simple
 Miki09: Uljahn do u have any info about when the silver opens?
 Ajaiy: but there are millions of strategies
 Uljahn: Miki09: no precise info atm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/">https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/</a>
 Miki09: ok thx
 SirLoxley: the rules are very vague here, it's really easy to miss, there's only one line about 'even if he's controlled' ...
 avdg: There is referee code, though the description isn't the worst imo
 avdg: There might still be some try and error involved, explaining things clearly is a hard thing to do
 avdg: The code can be found here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/tree/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/tree/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game</a>
 MACKEYTH: Ooh, top 10!
 Nerchio: gz
 avdg: nice
 avdg: gonna have to clean up my code before I push again, now cleaning up and luckily no big bugs here
 avdg: my ai now takes a bit more time with mostly about 1 full ms
 avdg: but I now see peeks at 20ms
 avdg: hmm
 avdg: oh I guess I read the wrong number
 msumera: how do you check that?
 avdg: `const { performance } = require("perf_hooks"); performance.now()`
 avdg: at least in js/ts
 Nerchio: playing defense in this game is pretty fun
 avdg: mine is quite defensive
 Nerchio: I will write offensive when I am satisfied with my defense, which is far from it :grin:
 avdg: I'm making already changes to improve offensive implementations later
 wlesavo: if you sim the defence you will  already sim the offence as well :slight_smile:
 karliso: Best defense is a good offense
 avdg: hmm my code simming?
 wlesavo: oh hi karliso, how you feel about this game? :slight_smile:
 avdg: it's not even comparing 2 states at the moment except 1 thing that is not related to simming
 avdg: (more related to math I can't do in my head so I took the slow way)
 avdg: (so I have a function doing n instead of 1, but with a low n)
 karliso: wlesavo nnguys say is it quite unnable so that is good I think.
 k4aAki: Hey boys, beginner question here. I expected to be threat_for to be only 1 if its trajectory is pointing towards my base. but it seems like its default 1
 avdg: you mean, you mostly get the value 1
 RoyTorre: Jo! I've been first in my league for a while, but I'm not advancing. How do I get into a higher league?
 avdg: RoyTorre did you get a working bot yet?
 RoyTorre: Yep and I pushed it live in arena too
 avdg: does it kill incoming monsters?
 k4aAki: its seems like i messed up. just printed the inputs
 RoyTorre: Yes it does. I win most battles 
 RoyTorre: I'm in wood 1 though XD, but for some reason it doesn't send me to a higher league
 avdg: I'm now rank 660 in bronze with a bot I submitted yesterday evening
 RoyTorre: Ah maybe your league changes over night then or something
 avdg: the bot needs to be kinda flawless mostly, unless you have a fun bug making your bot win better than expected (already happened to me a few times)
 avdg: but otherwise, it just a matter of yeasting the bot sometimes
 RoyTorre: I see so I'll just have to push the code to the arena?
 ganbat24: I am in 2570 with a bot that doesnt use mana
 avdg: yeah, and see if it doesn't do weird behaviour
 avdg: I got around 1800 yesterday without using mana (just before I added wind casts and after fixing bugs)
 avdg: that position may be higher now, with more bots being better
 RoyTorre: I see thanks! 
 avdg: I guess around 2000 with the same bot
 DollarAkshay: what happens if wind is used on the edge of the map&#160;?
 IvesL: from my experience, it stucks at that point
 IvesL: so it will be constantly pushed and get stuck if your code works like that
 Ekaon: the 100ms of game turn are processed after le last monster is read&#160;? Because when i check it can be 80ms long to read the entities
 LaurensD: @Ekaeon per constraint it could be &lt; 50ms for turns; the first turn is allowed to be &lt; 1000 ms
 Uljahn: start the measurement after reading the first line of inputs
 Ekaon: So I dont understand why my program can run 83ms without being shut down
 jacek: sometimes there is margin but its unreliable
 Ekaon: I benchmarked that reading entities can last 101ms long
 LaurensD: are you sure it's 83ms? that's rather slow (I think&#160;:?)
 Ekaon: Yes, this is why I'm surprised. I use c++ and it's only the entity reading phase that take this long
 Ekaon: Not always tho
 Ekaon: In avg it's 23ms
 Ekaon: Maybe the testing area has slow stream operations&#160;?
 Uljahn: maybe you're measuring it wrong?
 avdg: I write nodejs code and it's doing turns usually in around 1 ms with additional logic I added just now
 Ekaon: I'm pretty confident, but I can show you what i use to measure
 Ekaon: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f12df54e-717a-4e5a-82b2-8eae13f0aeb6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f12df54e-717a-4e5a-82b2-8eae13f0aeb6</a>
 avdg: I've done some precautions though about perf from the start
 LaurensD: lol
 LaurensD: oh wait
 Uljahn: Ekaon: do you start the measurement after reading the first line of inputs?
 avdg: it can do turns in less than .2 ms at best
 avdg: (mine is measured after reading)
 LaurensD: Oh well mine is also like 20 a 40 ms whoopsy
 ycsvenom: is silver league open now?
 slazure: whats silver league
 avdg: few hours
 Ekaon: In first place I measured before the first reading until the end of turn. But I was able to restrain it around only the reading of entities 
 avdg: a bit more than 3 hours and silver is open
 slazure: what is silver
 ycsvenom: on the contest slazure
 ycsvenom: bot programming
 Ekaon: Because actually all my others bit of code are smaller than 1ms
 avdg: silver is better than bronze, bots are ranked
 avdg: Are you sure it's not the waiting on input?
 avdg: Because that is normal
 Ekaon: You mean before the first input&#160;?
 avdg: yeah
 Uljahn: so you're measuring the referee time and your opponents time lol
 avdg: I wonder if the opponent is executed in parallel
 jacek: theyre sequential in referee
 RoyTorre: How can I debug log with python?
 jacek: print to stderr
 Uljahn: print to error stream with file=sys.stderr argument
 jacek: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Ekaon: Haaa no you're write, the time is while reading the first input
 RoyTorre: Thanks
 avdg:&#160;:-)
 Uljahn: :upside_down:
 Ekaon: Okay my bad
 Ekaon: Mystery solved
 jacek: (:
 ycsvenom: it would be magnificent if the rank appears as tooltip when you point to someone in vs battles
 avdg: (hmm my mind thinks it sees references with bomberman game)
 LaurensD: Hmm, if you do move to XX and the next turn execute wait; will it keep walking or stay in place?
 avdg: move is only executed once unless it is a monster
 avdg: (but meh, you can't control monsters except with a spell)
 LaurensD: whoopsy with move I ment my own hero
 Uemu: I rly lose a lot when it comes to wildmana score 
 LaurensD: @Uemu yeah! got to fix that also =P
 avdg: my bot can plan attack very well, as long as it sees the monsters
 avdg: that's enough to gain a lot of mana for me
 avdg: (and yeah, wild mana is gained outside your own base)
 ycsvenom: i hate aggressive bots
 avdg: and my bot only focusses on defence for now
 ycsvenom: what's your rank?
 avdg: 663 now
 avdg: added some big changes to my ai, but my ai doesn't take advantage of the change now
 IvesL: if you want to play against aggressive bot, try "statiolake"
 avdg: hmm, wonder if I win
 avdg: nope
 _NikJ: statiolake is so aggressive and I'm so passive that he loses to normal spiders before he can get to my base
 _NikJ: but man oh man is it an annoying strategy :D
 IvesL: he goes all in
 IvesL: i like his thinking
 Miki09: Like th #986th statiolake?
 avdg: just shoot one 1 mentallity :D
 avdg: *one in
 avdg: hmm second run, I win
 IvesL: but honestly his strategy still has great potential, if he manages to herd 3 together
 avdg: it would be scary if he does symmetry
 avdg: and target the one very close to base
 ycsvenom: maybe if we do vulnerability testing on the contest code maybe we can change it's variables from outside  :smiley:
 IvesL: his current strategy will will harm his herd
 IvesL: still*
 LaurensD: @IvesL why does it feel like I
 LaurensD: I'm playing with myself
 LaurensD: and then getting rekt
 Illedan: :tada:
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623529501">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623529501</a>
 Miki09: Im submitting new code, looks pretty good
 Pieman: Is silver unlocked yet&#160;?
 Miki09: no
 Ekaon: In 2h
 IvesL: @LaurensD, i feel like you need to set priority for your heroes, rather than all of them rushing for the same target
 avdg: hmm his bot is random, same run, different result
 avdg: or maybe it's because I changed something in my code (I only changed something in the debug output)
 LaurensD: @IvesL had something that made sure that there were not two attacking the same target but that did not work too well haha
 avdg: or maybe he updated his bot
 avdg: this is one run from my ai
 IvesL: @avdg, i think you use too many wind in early turns
 IvesL: when you can hunt them for mana
 1mpossible_c: playing codingame makes me feel so smart but in reality I suck at programming
 avdg: it is already conservative, though the checks needs to be improved
 Miki09: Oh god
 Miki09: He uses 3 winds at same time
 Miki09: O.O
 avdg: outside base it only uses wind when it think it is effective
 IvesL: @1mpossible_c same same
 ycsvenom: that was brutal avdg
 1mpossible_c: when there's character criteria, it becomes really unfair for C-family languages
 ycsvenom: he is an aggressive player
 1mpossible_c: python and similar languages will just write very short functions
 1mpossible_c: C-family needs curly bracelets for beginners lol
 avdg:&#160;? what is brutal?
 LaurensD: throwing the enemy right to the finish
 ycsvenom: i mean the reply you shared
 LaurensD: dude did the same to me
 ycsvenom: replay*
 avdg: it's the only way my ai can be outbeated I believe apart from overloading
 avdg: well, at least my defence
 RoyTorre: fuck had to revert 2 h of work because of a bug XD
 antiwonto: [auto] RoyTorre be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 avdg: ai's don't seem to like that :p
 Divlo: Hello, world!
 Divlo: :sunglasses:
 ycsvenom: till now i have max of 4 lose streak
 LaurensD: @avdg I thought challenge accepted; but awww <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623537597">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623537597</a>
 avdg: it's only using wind now :p
 LaurensD: mine has not really brains atm
 LaurensD: just randoms
 LaurensD: lol
 avdg: hmm I might get a very aggressive bot working quite soon
 LaurensD: is there any trick to throw enemies really far?
 Aramang: multiple winds on the same turn
 avdg: I'm working around some fog issues right now
 LaurensD: interesting
 avdg: what also helps: your ai's aim in the same direction
 StyllyMyle: Sup bois
 StyllyMyle: long time no see
 Aramang: yeah if the heroes arent in the same location they need to shoot in parallel, not at the same point
 LaurensD: @avdg always to the enemy base :3
 avdg:&#160;? my winds?
 avdg: yeah
 LaurensD: does it help being in front of them and then execute with winds? or isn't there a logic like that
 LaurensD: so the draft throw is bigger
 avdg: there is logic to keep my heroes a bit outside base, but with 1 always near base
 avdg: and 2200 is the distance it travels
 avdg: base fog is 6000
 StyllyMyle: Cannot get promoted to wood 1?
 avdg: StyllyMyle did you just submit?
 StyllyMyle: I can only get test in arena button
 StyllyMyle: No submit
 StyllyMyle: and after testing, Im above bot but still can't get upgrade
 avdg: you need to wait the full rank stabilization procedure
 Miki09: Illedan congrats on #3
 untab: this is good crack
 Illedan: ty
 avdg: hmm my new changes add 323 lines of code to the ai and it currently doesn't improve the ai at all, will work on that soon
 Miki09: Im currently on 153 line&#160;:-)
 avdg: 1125
 Miki09: lol
 madninjaskillz: nearly 600 lines and every change makes it worse&#160;:|
 tealfrog: what language?
 madninjaskillz: c#
 Miki09: me python
 avdg: typescript
 avdg: and still doing less than 1 ms each turn
 Audatic: I feel if you make it top 50 they should give you more than 50 battles for the rank to stabilize. Just so random at the top spots.
 tealfrog: I'm at 200 lines in python which seems enough for this league (12%)
 Miki09: With my 152 lines I'm #746
 Illedan: 1300 for 3rd
 Miki09: nice
 avdg: I wonder if there are others who track how long their bot spend on 1 turn
 Miki09: Me totally not
 VizGhar: 1300? you are searching right?
 struct: you are doing good Illedan
 VizGhar: like stuc t during last multi :P
 Miki09: Does anyone know somebody who uses nn?
 VizGhar: you were 1st for quite some time
 struct: well I was beta tester
 VizGhar: aha ok :P
 avdg: you reused your code?
 struct: on previous contest yeah
 struct: but it wasnt that strong
 struct: and I didnt really have anyone to test against
 struct: so it wasn't a huge advantage
 avdg: simming this game isn't that hard and unless your bot keeps state, the info for each turn is quite small
 avdg: so in best case, dump data, run local
 avdg: at least, if you had bugs
 struct: My final bot had 100% win rate vs the beta tester bot
 struct: so
 avdg: ah
 avdg: you could only play with yourself :p
 struct: I could play vs the other beta testers
 struct: but my bot also had very high win rate vs them
 avdg: or share (parts of) the code with your collegues
 avdg: because you are not in contest anyway
 struct: I didnt share any code
 WannaBeHum1n: guys 
 WannaBeHum1n: is sliver out yet&#160;?
 avdg: 2 and a half hours now
 Alurian: 600 lines for 45 here. but using c#
 avdg: @Alurian is it fast?
 WannaBeHum1n: 104 lines js for 800 xD
 Alurian: wdym fast? 
 avdg: I guess less than 10ms a turn is still quite fast
 MACKEYTH: I'm up to 1138. A lot of trash has accumulated
 Alurian: I have no clue how fast. i can place a timer
 KamiTzayig: does this arena thing go forever?
 avdg: mine does it typically in less than 1 ms a turn in typescript even after adding some logic, but I focussed on optimisations a bit
 struct: the contest is 8 more days
 KamiTzayig: im rank 6 now and i have an idea how to improve
 struct: but after it gets released as a multi
 KamiTzayig: how do i stop?
 avdg: (rank 6600 here)
 WannaBeHum1n: KamiTzayig what language u using 
 Audatic: new submission has a winstreak of 22 so far, fingers crossed :D
 avdg: uh with 1 zero less
 WannaBeHum1n: out of curiosity
 KamiTzayig: python 3
 KamiTzayig: im new to this platform
 WannaBeHum1n: is it some genetic algortithm kind of stuff or conditions based bot&#160;?
 KamiTzayig: i clicked test in arena and have no idea how to go out lol
 JohnyDaison: just click in the dark area
 WannaBeHum1n: it keeps going by itself but u can press vs battles
 KamiTzayig: maybe this is not the same ranking what we are talking about
 WannaBeHum1n: to close it
 KamiTzayig: ahh ok thanks
 WannaBeHum1n: what division u on&#160;?
 KamiTzayig: wood 2, just start an hour ago
 WannaBeHum1n: ahh ok
 KamiTzayig: rank 4
 WannaBeHum1n: have fun
 KamiTzayig: lol
 KamiTzayig: what devision are you?
 KamiTzayig: leage
 WannaBeHum1n: bronze 770
 KamiTzayig: ok
 KamiTzayig: lets see if i can get there
 WannaBeHum1n: u will
 JohnyDaison: everyone is waiting in bronze for them to open silver
 WannaBeHum1n: u got this
 KamiTzayig: thanks :D
 Alurian: it's 18 ms 
 madninjaskillz: silver opening will make me look better - coz all the actually talented people will be out of bronze :D
 WannaBeHum1n: i have a questioin
 WannaBeHum1n: when silver opens up
 Alurian: max is 30ms. but it can still use a lot of improvement
 Alurian: in 2hours
 WannaBeHum1n: how many will get automatically get there
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 Nerchio: i'd say around 400 but we will see :P
 Nerchio: maybe more
 struct: way more
 Alurian: aight
 WannaBeHum1n: oof
 struct: I expect like 40%
 WannaBeHum1n: got get out of 700 800 range then
 WannaBeHum1n: XD
 struct: Alurian you have more than 2 hours
 Nerchio: finally the first 20 games of a submit will not be a waste of time
 Alurian: haha nah, waiting for silver :p
 Nerchio: when does silver open? in 12 minss?
 struct: people are saying 2 hours and 12 minutes
 Alurian: Hard to see what works atm with only 40 people above me, and i have exam in few days
 Nerchio: ok
 peerdb: Usually it shows when the next league opens in the IDE right? They had a timestamp there but removed it
 madninjaskillz: Finally improved... 711. Now scared to touch it lol 
 Alurian: here are my ranks when testing
 WannaBeHum1n: In case of a tie, the player who gained the highest amount of mana outside the radius of their base will win. this is called wild mana.
 Alurian: 847-1083-910-220-156-345-45
 WannaBeHum1n: what is the radius of base
 WannaBeHum1n: cuz 6000
 WannaBeHum1n: is vison range
 Alurian: 5000
 WannaBeHum1n: ahh ok 
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: How are ties determined? Same base health at the end of the game?
 WannaBeHum1n: in  case of a tie, the player who gained the highest amount of mana outside the radius of their base will win. this is called wild mana.
 _NikJ: if the health is the same then it takes into account wild mana aka the mana collected outside of your base
 IvesL: do we have wild mana as input
 Larbino: when does the silver league open&#160;?
 _NikJ: no, we don't IvesL
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: Thanks
 madninjaskillz: you can kinda calculate it - if an entity disapears - and you were attacking it and its not near your base, you can count it as a kill and thus mana
 IvesL: can we copy opponent's moves?
 avdg: hard to do in fog of war
 madninjaskillz: if you can see them
 WannaBeHum1n: if i see em
 Alurian: uhm
 IvesL: so we cant directly copy from output stream
 Alurian: every hit isd 1 mana
 avdg: don't blow when you have nothing to blow at though
 Alurian: Your team will also acquire 1 point of mana per damage dealt to a monster, even from monsters with no health left.
 avdg: I guess the copy bot will be a bad idea
 WannaBeHum1n: when u hit it  in the same turn
 WannaBeHum1n: how to print text in the game
 JB5: So far I was able to get to Bronze using simple code, I'm wondering if experienced programmers use any complex algorithms or data structures when implementing more complex code for this challenge?
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 JB5: like graph, min-max, ...?
 avdg: hmm I would benefit from extreme simple data structures though...
 IvesL: i dont mean to copy opponents, i only want to know its actions
 Audatic: I was top 10 now I am top 100 with only if/else no state
 JB5: ok, thanks - I'm new so was curious a bout it
 Alurian: top 50 with no state
 madninjaskillz: I'm an experience programmer and my code is dumb as hell - its just an FSM with different behaviours based on how agressive the enemy player is. Anything clever I make does poorly lol.
 Alurian: ooh i haven't calculated the enemy in yet 
 avdg: your bot has a basic empathy implementation?
 Ajaiy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623571150">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623571150</a>
 Ajaiy: I have no idea how it worked with Wood 1 code
 Audatic: same. If I send the hero where the mon should be next turn my win rate drops by about 10%
 avdg: my bot is basically the same for the first moves, except my ai push them out the base
 Alurian: simple is best haha
 WannaBeHum1n: Illedan are using genetic algotithms&#160;?
 Ophen: when will silver league drop 
 WannaBeHum1n: got to 678 if statements only xD
 avdg: 2 hours from now till silver
 msumera: what is the requirement to advance to silver?
 avdg: beat the bot that has yet to be determined
 madninjaskillz: can you read the name of the player youre against? So I can intentionally not go to silver. Wanna be a big fish in a little pond lol.
 JulienKerlero: The only infos you get are what the game tells you, I don't think you can read the player's name
 Astrobytes: of course not
 Audatic: nah then you could hard code strategies against player names....
 WannaBeHum1n: guys 
 JulienKerlero: But what you can do is pick a random number at the begening of the fight, and lose the game if it's below a threshold
 WannaBeHum1n: how to make text on hero
 WannaBeHum1n: using js
 Audatic: add it after command 
 JulienKerlero: That way, you'll never promote but you'll still be (sometimes) an unbeatable opponent
 avdg: you only get their base health and mana other than entity data
 Ophen: how do you know when silver will drop&#160;? where it is mentionned
 WannaBeHum1n: SPELL WIND 6000 5000 TEXT
 IvesL: i dont get how you are unbeatable by losing
 WannaBeHum1n: like this&#160;?
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/">https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/</a>
 IvesL: yes
 JulienKerlero: Let's say 50% of the time you lose intentionally
 JulienKerlero: You'll never get promoted
 avdg: it made the opponent scared I guess
 Mateuszone: how can index 0 be out of range in range(heroes_per_player) xd
 IvesL: but you lose intentionally is still beaten
 IvesL: so you are not unbeatable
 JulienKerlero: then you'll be promoted
 JulienKerlero: the goal here is not to be promoted
 JulienKerlero: to achieve that, you HAVE to lose games
 WannaBeHum1n: it is to be evil
 LaurensD: @Mateuszone perhaps it has not been filled yet&#160;:?
 IvesL: then just write random codes
 WannaBeHum1n: and make ur enemies doubt their skill as developers
 IvesL: randomize your actions
 Astrobytes: never heard so much nonsense
 IvesL: lmao yea
 WannaBeHum1n: guys this is super dumb
 WannaBeHum1n: but i am console.error an array
 WannaBeHum1n: how can i make the items in the array
 WannaBeHum1n: show under each other
 JulienKerlero: IvesL the goal is also the be "the unbeatable guy" and thus have a really good AI
 WannaBeHum1n: not in a long line
 JulienKerlero: add a \n after each element&#160;?
 JulienKerlero: or whatever the new line symbol is in your programming langage (is it Java&#160;?)
 WannaBeHum1n: [item, \n, item]
 WannaBeHum1n: like this&#160;?
 JulienKerlero: yup
 IvesL: i will let you continue your work there
 WannaBeHum1n: ty
 IvesL: seems i have misunderstanding about the concept of unbeatable
 Puiss51: Hi I think silver league is not opened yet, does somebody know when it would be?
 WannaBeHum1n: asked earlier
 WannaBeHum1n: people said
 DollarAkshay: is mana gained in the opponent base considered as wild mana&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: in around 2hrs
 DollarAkshay: "wild mana: mana gained outside the radius of your base."
 DollarAkshay: So I am guessing mana in the enemy base is wild mana&#160;?
 Alurian: JUP
 WannaBeHum1n: when all my heros attack the same entity
 WannaBeHum1n: do i gain mana 
 WannaBeHum1n: more
 WannaBeHum1n: than hitting by single hero
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 IvesL: just for imagination, but would it be a good idea that the heroes can be leveled up by slaying certain numbers of monsters for better attributes, like speed, damage, spells
 Alurian: Your team will also acquire 1 point of mana per damage dealt to a monster, even from monsters with no health left.
 WannaBeHum1n: i cant manage to understand the sentence
 WannaBeHum1n: because all heros do damage
 WannaBeHum1n: same turn
 Alurian: if you hit a monster that has 1 health
 Alurian: with 3 heroes
 SergeyShirokov: leveling up will be a runoff mechanic
 Alurian: you get three mana anyway
 Alurian: even though the first would kill it
 WannaBeHum1n: but this is an edge scenario
 WannaBeHum1n: what id monster full hp
 WannaBeHum1n: i wont gain anthing right&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: ot no
 WannaBeHum1n: or*
 Alurian: if you hit an enemy with more health, you just do 3 dmg and get 3 manba
 Alurian: EVERY 1 dmg = 1 mana
 WannaBeHum1n: so basically i just kill it faster
 WannaBeHum1n: no mana gained
 WannaBeHum1n: ty
 WannaBeHum1n: 4 taking the time
 Alurian: what you mean no mana gained 
 WannaBeHum1n: to help
 Alurian: at the edge case you gain extra mana
 WannaBeHum1n: yeah
 WannaBeHum1n: but i am thinking
 WannaBeHum1n: i divide them to attack more monsters xould be more beneficial
 WannaBeHum1n: cuz i always lose by wild mana
 Alurian: hitting multiple monsters at once is more beneficial tho. because 1 hero can attack 5 monsters at once for example
 Alurian: i send 2 out to get wild mana and one to defend
 WannaBeHum1n: yeah i think i am statrting to understand why i dont gain as much mana
 Alurian: the multiple monsters is a more complex subject i am yet to implement
 Mateuszone: guys im a newbie
 WannaBeHum1n: scan all monsters 
 WannaBeHum1n: check if coordinates
 Mateuszone: how i can make sure that wind will not be casted towards my base?xd
 WannaBeHum1n: are in same
 WannaBeHum1n: hitting range
 WannaBeHum1n: mobilize
 WannaBeHum1n: hero
 WannaBeHum1n: u mean this Alurian&#160;?
 KamiTzayig: im rank 1 in wood league, how do i get to bronze?
 WannaBeHum1n: wait
 WannaBeHum1n: can take even 5 mins
 Alurian: yeah that's way more complex. because you also have to take into account that they move. so if it's to far away you will just waste time and your hero will just be running around hityting nothing
 WannaBeHum1n: u will get a notification
 Alurian: mateusz
 Alurian: 'use SPELL WIND ENEMYBASE.X ENEMYBASE.Y
 Alurian: themn you blow to enemy base
 WannaBeHum1n: alurian yeah accounting for direction would be hard too
 WannaBeHum1n: the can be going opposit eways
 WannaBeHum1n: resulting in them getting out of hit range faster
 Alurian: yeah so in theory its simple but in practice its not
 WannaBeHum1n: yup
 Alurian: right now i just hit closest target 
 Alurian: what rank are you wanna?
 Thheo: herocan't move less than 800 units?
 WannaBeHum1n: can i dm u Alurian?
 Alurian: sure
 Alurian: yes they can move less 
 Alurian: they move 800 maximum
 IvesL: shorter target xy
 Alurian: I've never used the wait command lol
 Mateuszone: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c244ab1b-4563-428f-aed4-5268baa9874d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c244ab1b-4563-428f-aed4-5268baa9874d</a>
 Mateuszone: guys why it forces my all 3 heroes to slowly go towards enemy base instead of forcing only hero number 0 to go there?
 jacek: does it work? no out of syncs messages?
 jacek: because after the if (i == 0) there is no else nor return
 avdg: so they all move towardds the spiders?
 avdg: I don't see where spiders_ranked is evaluated, but it must be unchanged for all 3 heroes
 IvesL: could you provide a replay
 avdg: the first loop only may trigger the first if statement
 Mateuszone: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28aab8f5-6034-47a9-86b6-6ee97cddfa34">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28aab8f5-6034-47a9-86b6-6ee97cddfa34</a>
 Mateuszone: thats a full code
 avdg: the other 2 will do the snake check I guess
 Wizard-Dude: I thought the silver league would open up today, where's the boss?
 jrke: it will open in few hours
 Illedan: Usually around 6pm, but might be whenever
 IvesL: yea very soon
 LaurensD: I heard someone say 'boss', you have summoned me
 LaurensD: Very good tactic by standing still, you have defeated me
 dbdr: we used to know which ms the league would open, but that has been remove apparently :D
 Alurian: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/">https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/</a>
 Alurian: thats when
 JohnyDaison: Mateuszone the line "spiders_ranked.append(spider)" seems sus
 Illedan: They couldn't deliver with MS accuracy dbdr :P
 jrke: dbdr this may help <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2022-04-21">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2022-04-21</a>

 jrke: here
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: what's that leaderboard for?
 jrke: it says 3pm gmt
 thekindboy: hi guys i want to get better with python 
 thekindboy: whats your advice plz
 dbdr: practice
 LaurensD: basics tutorials
 IvesL: code more?
 DollarAkshay: r/ProgrammerHumor
 DollarAkshay: :P
 Thheo: when does silver open?
 avdg: less than an hour
 avdg: normally
 Thheo: ty
 JohnyDaison: Mateuszone or it could the be the extra 2 spaces before print('SPELL WIND 17630 9000')
 SashaNukem: How to add numbers above my heroes?
 Darleanow: Hello everyone
 Darleanow: i need to build a machine learning app
 SashaNukem: Hi👋
 Darleanow: but i need to find like whats the purpose of it
 Darleanow: i have no ideas&#160;:/
 Uljahn: generate some ideas [solved]
 Darleanow: OH 
 JohnyDaison: SashaNukem just add extra text at the end of commands for your heroes e.g. WAIT TEXT
 avdg: Submitting my new ai
 avdg: can't wait for the results :P
 Kukiss: good luck&#160;:)
 avdg: I think I might have to fix something already, but it luckily doesn't break the bot
 MACKEYTH: My bot feels like a Jenga tower right now. Every time I change or add something, it falls over.
 Anonymous_004: |M|power|N| and |N|power|M| my math is damn sucks i can't even solve this :D
 JohnyDaison: time for a refactor
 struct: league did not open yet?
 avdg: 20 min and you know
 avdg: hm need to fix few bugs in my code, luckily not on the critical part
 WannaBeHum1n: says 16mins on the scoreboard
 bolmos-o: Where do you check silver league opening time? I cannot find it anywhere...
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/">https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/</a>
 Marrggta: Does the SHIELD spell prevent from being affected by the WIND spell?
 DaNinja: rtfs: The target entity cannot be targeted by spells for the next 12 rounds
 Marrggta: yes, but for me it wasn't clear if the wind target entities as we don't specify any id there
 ScifiSpirit: it says "All entities" for me in statement for wind
 ScifiSpirit: (except your own heroes)
 Uljahn: also shield spell does not protect from a spell from this same turn.
 ScifiSpirit: also technical details say that spells may be cancelled
 ScifiSpirit: does not say if by opponent, but i assume so
 vvandenb: How do I name my heroes pls?
 struct: cout &lt;&lt; "WAIT message you want\n";
 struct: so normal commmand followed by the message
 aatj: Do the entity trajectory variables vx  and vy represent the relative trajectory from the current x,y of the entity, or the ultimate target x,y of the entity?
 vvandenb: so you can tell them to wait and do somethin?G
 MACKEYTH: aatj relative
 vvandenb: thx
 pixelxd: yes
 aatj: Thanks MACKEYTH
 pixelxd: :stuck_out_tongue:
 aatj: What is the promotion threshold?
 Rikus: vvandenb you just append any text AFTER your command (move/wait/cast) and that will be printed on top of your hero(remember to add a Space character " " between your command and th text)
 MACKEYTH: I've been watching erick.lee's bot trying to figure out what makes it so good.
 jacek: is it love?
 MACKEYTH: The thing that stands out most is that it's really good at mana hunting.
 Epigene: I'm trying "WIND 14000 4000" and erroring out with "Bad command". Do the coords need to be in range of the caster? Even so, I think I am..
 aatj: Thanks Rikus - didn't know that either
 MACKEYTH: SPELL WIND x y
 MrAnderson: @aatj rank ahead of the boss after the evaluation is over
 aatj: Thanks MrAnderson
 Alurian: 1 minute...
 MACKEYTH: spell commands start with SPELL ... Epigene
 Miki09: So silver should be now?
 Alurian: yes
 Alurian: I assume it'll take a minute to be here
 einaj: do we need to resubmit to get promoted to silver?
 Miki09: ok
 Alurian: no i don't think so
 avdg: I guess it will be slow to process bot submissions from now
 Miki09: yeah
 Miki09: rip the servers
 Miki09: ITS HERE
 Alurian: it's here
 avdg: let's see how boss 3 behaves
 Alurian: ez win
 avdg: hmm I can beat boss 3
 Alurian: hell yeah
 _NikJ: need a resubmit or no?
 aCat: no
 avdg: I've submitted my fixes just in time&#160;:-)
 Miki09: its promoting some guys!
 Miki09: I hope ill get in silver
 avdg: my ai only uses wind as spell for now
 Nerchio: bronze boss isnt agressive
 Alurian: newp
 Thibauld: ey silver league
 Thibauld: Just opened?
 Alurian: yes
 Alurian: it's processing
 Miki09: lol my "play in progress" is still loading&#160;:-)
 IvesL: bronze bot looks familiar
 avdg: already found out which ai?
 MrAlexS: @madninjaskillz i know that feeling
 Miki09: I cant get match to load so I havent seen the boss yet
 Miki09: Network error&#160;: status 504
 Miki09: rip servers
 _NikJ: boss aggressive af :D
 MACKEYTH: Yay, flawless victory vs Boss 3. Silver here I come.
 Thibauld: omg the update overwrote my code with an old version&#160;:/
 marata13: guys do you know how long it takes before the game promotes you to the next league?
 IvesL: @Thibauld you are right, so as mine
 Alurian: not long
 madninjaskillz: balls. im in silver.
 JohnyDaison: yea, the fact the it refreshes the page without asking is annoying
 avdg: it can take a while if servers are overloaded
 Waffle3z: watching my bronze rank climb as everyone is promoted
 Alurian: but right now it's bumping up silver peeps
 Alurian: it's going through list backwards lol
 avdg: I guess I will bump to silver soon
 avdg: top 500 now (not sure how many left bronze now)
 MACKEYTH: Hm. Boss 3 is a defense bot. I'm surprised.
 Miki09: I hope I will bump to silver soon
 avdg: my ai defends better
 struct: So they still promoted like the old way
 einaj: i was top 300 but havnt been bumped jet. resubmitted just in case
 struct: and have everyone compute the battles again ....
 KCrown: I got into silver :P 
 Alurian: top 40 but still bronze
 Audatic: same top 40
 Whiskee: same
 Miki09: 510 in bronze&#160;:-(
 avdg: 452 now
 Alurian: eyy
 Alurian: silver
 Thheo: top 1000 placed in silver hmmm
 Fubuchi: Do I need to resubmit to promote?
 peerdb: bruh i was 200th, how come I still am in bronze
 avdg: nope fubucchi
 avdg: it may slow things even down maybe (not 100% sure)
 Miki09: peerdb its promoting from backwards
 avdg: but resubmitting will at least mean you have to wait all the battles
 Miki09: the top 1 player is still in bronze
 peerdb: Miki09 okay thanks. why tho
 Alurian: it will def slow you down
 avdg: and the server is already loaded -&gt; even slower
 Alurian: i think it's promoting randomly
 struct: 718 computing...
 struct: and it will be even more once all get propmoted
 jrke: again silver bug!
 Waffle3z: what bot was used for the bronze boss, the one in 1000th?
 avdg: 718 computing is server load?
 jrke: in one contest silver got opened on the first day only due to server errors
 Miki09: "Codingame ended  24.4.2022 because all the servers blew up and killed whole france"
 Alurian: well this is a massive load 
 struct: I dont know how many got promoted
 struct: but I guess it will be 1.5k computing soon
 struct: it will take hours
 jrke: i am enjoying it my rank went from 104 to 712 just under 10mins:grimacing:
 JohnyDaison: Silver currently shows me 670 members
 IvesL: 600-700 promoted
 Alurian: 690 members
 jrke: IvesL it will be more than that
 Alurian: 710
 jrke: there is server error ig
 avdg: I hope they picked a fast boss
 a1.dk: @jrke i have diferent situation from 400 to 79 XD
 jrke: :grinning:
 IvesL: @jrke i expect top 1500-2000
 jrke: expecting same
 Alurian: 760
 jrke: but atleast i am expecting me to be in silver
 jrke: :grinning:
 Scarfield: can you see the bronze boss yet, i cant pick it as opponent
 Miki09: I can pick him
 msumera: when is gold opened?
 avdg: there isn't one yet
 IvesL: i will just leave it here right now, just to avoid further code loss due to page refresh
 avdg: it's probably a dump ai
 Miki09: Im still in bronze&#160;:-(
 avdg: 343 in bronze now
 IvesL: it is supposed to be a dumb ai, it's the starting the league after tutorial
 Miki09: me 381
 Miki09: 372
 avdg: hmm a player few positions higher than me promoted now
 Alurian: 920
 jrke: finally i reached silver
 Lexer31: why best players are still in bronze
 jrke: after travelling 104 to 927
 Waffle3z: why's it called "mad pod racing" now
 jrke: Lexer31 server errors
 JackMc: caus pods are mad
 Scarfield: copyright worries waffles
 Bernard_Lowe: Lexer31, I don't know, but it's hilarious. Many of top 50 are still in bronze.
 Kukiss: I was ranked ~700 and got promoted very fast. So it really could go backward 
 Miki09: Illedan and butcher still in bronze
 IvesL: nah its random
 Scarfield: a lot of other multies and puzzles have had name changes
 KCrown: no rule changes in silver it seems?
 MACKEYTH: Maybe players closer to the boss's rank are being promoted first?
 jrke: 1216 computing damn CG is gonna ...
 IvesL: no rules will be changed from bronze
 peerdb: why is it promoting backwards wtf
 avdg: bronze has all the rules
 YiCao: The system seems blocked again? Terriable
 KCrown: ah I hate changes 
 gokubill: hi
 JohnyDaison: don't worry, already over 1000 promoted
 MACKEYTH: Silver's still growing. Up to 1040 now.
 CommanderCero: how am i rank 914 in silver when I was 1600 in bronze
 Miki09: lol
 jacek: inflation
 avdg: rank is probably shuffled and many didn't made it through yet
 gokubill: con cặc
 madninjaskillz: less people in siver - and being high rank doesnt seem to be what promotes you
 Aramang: i think the more people in a league the less accurate the ranks, due to limited games played
 Alurian: 1104
 Miki09: Now im 295 in bronze
 avdg: it's hard to compare bots when they have different strategies to win
 Waffle3z: nontransitive
 daffie: I agree the scoring system is pretty basic in this
 Miki09: Everyone has got like "battles: 4%"
 Miki09: Its gonna take ages
 avdg: 235th here now
 SabertheLost: 106
 Thheo: would it be possible to do the battles on user's computers?
 jacek: silver :tada:
 Miki09: congrats
 SabertheLost: is there a good way to know how much time you have spent on each turn?
 struct: I was promoted and I was rank 2k?
 struct: how many made it through
 struct: lol
 avdg: me not yet
 jacek: i was 1.5k
 msumera: got from 30th to 16th in bronze, so itf it's random ~50% is processed&#160;:)
 SabertheLost: 1364 seems to be in silver
 avdg: my queue is now 214
 MACKEYTH: What language SabertheLost?
 Miki09: Butcher2013 now in silver
 LaurensD: boss 3 is pretty weak, though lost because of wild mana
 SabertheLost: Java Mackeyth
 Miki09: me 2
 MACKEYTH: I usually use System.currentTimeMillis()
 aatj: Yes, Boss 3 is easier than the test bot.
 KCrown: silver numbers are stilling going up. its at 1497 for me ... so probably the first 2000 gets in? 
 MACKEYTH: Grab a start time immediately after your first input read statement
 struct: KCrown I was 1979
 struct: so its likely
 therealbeef: 2100 ppl will be left in bronze it seems (based on current boss ranking)
 Kagey: Are there new mechanics in the silver league&#160;?
 Miki09: I was 777 and im still in bronze&#160;:-(
 struct: no
 struct: anyone has a replay of boss 3 playing?
 struct: I want to watch him but I cant play against him anymore

 struct: ty
 Ekaon: Someone has settup the challenge in local&#160;?
 KCrown: did boss3 do anything differnt?
 struct: I have no idea how my bot places higher than boss 3
 struct: My bot plays much worse than that
 Runner87: new rules for silver?
 struct: no
 KCrown: silver have the same rules
 Kagey: By the way does anyone know why I have this error&#160;? error: cannot find symbol
 Runner87: CONTROL&#160;: change direction of monster  ?? or no?
 Kagey: The arrow is pointing on the dot of List.of(...)
 struct: on next turn yes
 Miki09: Why boss 3 so bad?
 Miki09: He tries to control shielded spiders
 aatj: The thing that makes boss 3 so easy is that it isn't standing next to your base casting spells.
 Wontonimo: oh cool, i got promoted to silver without doing anything
 Wontonimo: but i'm bottom of the bottom
 aatj: @MACKEYTH is 3 now in bronze
 Wontonimo: no need to use the "@" aatj
 aatj: Thanks Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: btw, the text is red only because your name is in it
 struct: my bot should not have made it to silver
 Wontonimo: :grin: glad it did
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i made it to silver while i was gone, kewl...noww my bot is jumping +/- 300 ranks in minutes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did it just open?
 avdg: a half hour ago
 Miki09: And many people still not promoted
 Kukiss: maybe all will go to silver :p1600 already
 Lexer31: there is too much people in silver 
 avdg: now someone a few spots before me got promoted
 Miki09: avdg what place r u?
 LarsVR: what got changed in silver?
 LarsVR: did not get the popup
 Miki09: nothing
 avdg: 161 now in bronze
 Miki09: me 182
 LarsVR: ah wut, thought something changed every league
 Wontonimo: nope
 madninjaskillz: when you got to bronze it said "youve unlocked the full game"
 MACKEYTH: Usually all the game mechanics are available in bronze.
 Wontonimo: that's is only mad pod racing.  everything else has consistent rules from bronze on
 LarsVR: aha, mb
 MACKEYTH: Mad Pod Racing is a glaring exception
 Wontonimo: +1 MACKEYTH  "we are thinking the same thing"
 Wontonimo: wow, my score is -4.05&#160;!
 Ekaon: So.. When the gold league will open&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that's bad
 HoriMiyamura: Hi Wontonimo, long time no see
 HoriMiyamura: You are mod now?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i've been upgraded
 Wontonimo: Modtonimo
 HoriMiyamura: haha
 Aramang: Wontonimo(d)
 Scarfield: Wonmodimo
 Wontonimo: oh, i like that one
 HoriMiyamura: I wonder If I can use an AI algorithm for this problem?
 Wontonimo: yes you can
 HoriMiyamura: too many randomize things
 benobab: When do the next leagues open?
 Wontonimo: no, that's not a problem
 HoriMiyamura: really?
 Wontonimo: i don't think it is published here.  maybe on discord.  go check there
 Wontonimo: ^^ benobab
 benobab: alright thanks
 struct: oh no
 Wontonimo: so, consider this HoriMiyamura&#160;: let's say you have a small sim thatt only takes into account what is visible
 HoriMiyamura: is there a group on discord discuss about algorithms to solve this problem&#160;? Wontonimo
 HoriMiyamura: oh
 struct: 2k computing
 struct: and its back to 100 battles
 HoriMiyamura: do you have next Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: let's say you've hard coded 4 different if/else bots.  use your sim to check which if/else bot does the best over the next 5 turns.  
 struct: 200k matches incoming rip servers
 avdg: 113th
 avdg: and getting a fight now
 avdg: oh, it's not the bot
 Wontonimo: I don't have a sim, or a good if/else bot right now HoriMiyamura.  I haven't been serious about this competition
 avdg: hmm I'm colored different now
 avdg: and back, weird
 avdg: got promoted anyway
 avdg: yey
 HoriMiyamura: I can write a sim myself I think
 HoriMiyamura: but why do I need 4 different if else bot?
 Wontonimo: no, you don't.  it was just an example
 HoriMiyamura: ah
 iTsluku: when is gold open?
 Wontonimo: "imagine" that you had written 3-7 different if/else bots that handle different situations.  your sim will help you chose which one is best over the next 5-10 turns
 Uljahn: in two days
 HoriMiyamura: so you mean we don't care about the random things
 Wontonimo: no, we do.  but a first implementation that ignores outside the FOG will probably do well
 Wontonimo: something that takes into account a probabilistic view of what's in the FOG will probably do better
 iTsluku: ty Uljahn
 Wontonimo: but i'm just guessing
 HoriMiyamura: ummm
 Scarfield: the random things are also somewhat limited, only newly spawning monsters, and monsters thrown out of a base area
 KCrown: THIS time maybe a sim wont be the way to go?
 Wontonimo: looking at replays of the top players, it looks like if/else is still very powerful in this game
 MACKEYTH: That's what I'm doing.
 KCrown: too many random events THIS time for sim to do well?
 HoriMiyamura: yeah
 HoriMiyamura: that's why I think we can't have a good bot algorithm
 Wontonimo: like how in CSB sim'ing just for drift helped ... i bet limited small sub-sims (if you will) will help
 MACKEYTH: There are so many possible moves from each game state, I don't know how you could Monte Carlo it
 Wontonimo: just MC, not MCTS.
 MACKEYTH: Either
 Scarfield: i dont think the random parts weill be an issue, but the search space is huuge. pruning will be the problem
 Aramang: there is a lot of math you can apply to efficiently assigning 3 heroes to n targets, I wouldn't be surprised if you could make silver with if/else and no spells
 struct: you can use heuristics to generate moves for monte carlo
 HoriMiyamura: csb doesn't have too many randomize I think
 HoriMiyamura: the rule a fix?
 Scarfield: yea thats probably what i will try struct
 KCrown: Ive gotten to gold with just if then else bots a few times 
 struct: The problem for me is not the number of moves
 struct: but the rng and fog
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i love his replay:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623689797">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623689797</a>
 KCrown: MC doesnt do will with fog and random ... but I hate MC personall :P 
 iTsluku: i think u need some kind of search pattern to overcome the fog; meaning where to go when the hero would idle --right?
 KCrown: I dont think u'll be idle much
 iTsluku: depends on idle pos
 MACKEYTH: I have my attacker orbit the opp bast at just over 6000 distance so the base can't see it.
 WJChua: I have one question guys. How do I set the game with the AI with me on the opposite side?
 MACKEYTH: My defenders just stay in place.
 KCrown: the first 10 turns maybe then the spiders comes and gets harder 
 iTsluku: remove players and add them in the different order
 iTsluku: just swap, down at the icons
 struct: WJChua press delete on ide
 struct: you can choose which player you play on ide

 WJChua: Thank you so much!
 WJChua: You guys are god sent. 
 struct: np
 WJChua: It took me so long. 
 KelvinAndHubbles: ouch dropped 700 places on league promote, guessing it's just slow servers trying to do all battles?
 CommanderCero: does wild mana count if the monster is in my base but the hero is outside?
 KCrown: thsi game is more like soccer/football ... a goalie or an attacker? two defender is the norm I think ... 
 iTsluku: everyone is on like 5% battles
 orangesnowfox: Kelvin I'm like 5% through my submit :p
 Mateuszone: the rules of debbuging says that you can append text after any command and that text will appear above your here, can someone show me example in python?
 orangesnowfox: yeah
 MACKEYTH: Hey, I'm Bronze #1! Kneel before your king, serfs.
 struct: print("MOVE 1000 1000 hello")
 struct: Mateuszone
 orangesnowfox: Mateuszone:print("WAIT your message here")
 iTsluku: print(&lt;action**&gt; &lt;msg&gt;)
 Wontonimo: i thought the rule for debugging was "debugging is twice as hard as coding.  if you write your code as cleverly as possible, by definition you do not have the skill to debug it"
 MACKEYTH: lol
 iTsluku: xd
 madninjaskillz: 90% of coding is removing bugs, the other 10% is adding new ones.
 RandomSteve: xddd
 Tryst: lol
 Wontonimo: All code has at least 1 bug, and all code can be optimized by at least 1 line.  Applied iteratively, all code can be reduced to 1 line that doesn't work
 VizGhar: So... greenfield project is just about creating bugs right?
 Wontonimo: that's why i love greenfield projects
 Wontonimo: it plays to my strengths
 madninjaskillz: green fields ARE full of random insect and bugs - where do you think the name GreenField comes from? :P
 VizGhar: :D so true
 VizGhar: 2000 players in silver already? is this a joke o.O
 avdg: is everybody that should be promoted promoted now?
 MACKEYTH: Not yet
 Wontonimo: wow, i changed 2 innocuous hyper parameters by marginal amounts and I jumped from 1200th to 600th.  Still same poopie bot, just different camp spots (by 50 units at that)
 VizGhar: wait a few hours avdg&#160;:)
 avdg: bronze bot isn't stabilized yet I guess
 VizGhar: Wontonimo so it will go to hyperparam optim?&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: hehe
 VizGhar: avdg bronze bot is probably only stable thing right now
 VizGhar: I can see you writing python script + GA just for testing
 VizGhar: I still havent decide how I'll approach this... But since I have no time for this contest, I'll probably just go with heuristic... bottom gold
 _NikJ: I just love how my dumb bot from 2 days ago is now in silver 70th place, while my "smart" bot can't win 2 consecutive rounds vs my dumb one
 CommanderCero: seems like your dumb strategie is just more effective xD
 CommanderCero: not so dumb afterall
 _NikJ: it's like a fortress, just farm and defend, that's all it does, yet it's 65th in silver atm
 orangesnowfox: Honestly, I've just been kinda waiting for silver to open just because of how difficult it is (for me) to write a bot that wins multiple spots on the RPS
 _NikJ: though I expect to drop like 100 places
 MACKEYTH: Ah, silver at last. Feels like my ears popping.
 aatj: Altitude sickness?
 MACKEYTH: No, same sense of relief
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623705186">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623705186</a> sim bot coming along nicely
 RandomSteve: why is the batman puzzle so hard afdsfs
 blasterpoard: might be ready before gold
 aatj: blasterpoard: your blues have a nice strategy
 ACad: when does gold open? is it already?
 LaurensD: only sucks you killed the ones walking in the enemy's base lol
 MACKEYTH: RandomSteve hint: you can solve Batman without diagonal leaps and centroids. Horizontal and vertical leaps work just as well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: have mercy blasterpoard , you spot and performed a killshot in 6 turns
 Wontonimo: share replay please PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he did... 9 minutes ago
 Scarfield: nice blaster, the wind train
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 killshots... mad crazy
 Wontonimo: nice nice
 Aramang: when naming a varaiable for an enemy hero, do you guys use "enemy" or "nme"?
 Scarfield: op
 therealbeef: oppo
 orangesnowfox: opponent bc I'm verbose like that
 therealbeef: their
 Scarfield: myHeroopHero has the same no. of chars, me like
 MACKEYTH: o&lt;descriptor&gt;
 orangesnowfox: `my` and `their` is pretty good too
 aatj: enemy_opponent_who_is_opposed_to_me_*
 Scarfield: xD
 orangesnowfox: lmaooo
 orangesnowfox: no... I'm not *that* verbose, I do have to fit in the submission file limit
 Scarfield: could shorten it with first letter of each word: eowiotm.. easy to read as well
 Ketroc: Is "Test in Arena" only running 1 game now for everyone else too?
 orangesnowfox: nah, my brain sees an owo there and that kind of acronym is *not* going in my code (even if its broken by an `i`) especially if you ignore the words like "is" and "to" in your acronyms like I do, you get EOWOM
 jacek: uwu?
 Scarfield: much better than opponent xD
 LaurensD: arena battle are a bit slow 
 LaurensD: haha
 orangesnowfox: jacek gdi
 LaurensD: probably hurts the server adding a new tier
 struct: only 2.4k submits
 struct: this is fine&#160;:)
 geppoz: there is a strange behavior in the inputs after a spell CONTROL on moster
 Scarfield: CG has fire extinguishers at the ready 
 orangesnowfox: geppoz wym?
 geppoz: it is given again with the previous vx,vy
 struct: yeah
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/54">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/54</a>
 struct: check this geppoz
 struct: I describe it there
 struct: I'm waiting for an answer
 orangesnowfox: huh, thanks for pointing that out, I'll... Need to work around that
 struct: because threatFor gets updated
 struct: but vx and vy dont
 orangesnowfox: if threatFor didn't get updated I would've noticed that a lot sooner (with the double controlling of mobs)
 geppoz: yeah, exactly
 struct: I think its what you described
 struct: I dont see the logic on giving one updated and other not
 HoriMiyamura: so will this be fixed?
 struct: no idea
 Scarfield: o0 so you have to remember prev pos of a monster, to be sure of their actual vel?
 HoriMiyamura: well then ...
 struct: dont think so Scarfield
 struct: Check what I say on the post is a bit different
 aatj: trajectory, rather than velocity, right?
 struct: The vx and vy get updated but only 2 turns later
 orangesnowfox: Oh, you know what, it might be so that you can't figure out where they're going
 orangesnowfox: Like, if the opponent controls a mob
 struct: orangesnowfox why does threatfor get updated then?
 orangesnowfox: *shrug*, just a guess
 Miki09: lol came here 1.5 hours later and still battles in progress: 9%
 struct: yeah I know, this is just my counter argument
 struct: in case that is their answer
 struct: It will only get slower Miki09
 Miki09:&#160;:-(
 jacek: time dilation is no joke
 struct: Don't know why they didnt promote like last time
 aatj: As Scarfield said, if you want to know the actual trajectory, you can try to store spider x,y across turns
 Wadzhamah: when i will be promoreted to the next legue?
 orangesnowfox: struct what happened last time?
 struct: They just added the top N players to the next league but without submit
 struct: you kept the same points you had
 orangesnowfox: ah
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623722348">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623722348</a> vs current rank 1
 orangesnowfox: aatj, you could store the ID and direction of mobs you control
 blasterpoard: just in case someone still thinks wild mana is relevant
 orangesnowfox: So, current meta is to spawncamp the mobs?
 HoriMiyamura: never Wadzhamah
 orangesnowfox: and then wham them into bases
 Nerchio: It's good but it won't be a winning strat
 VizGhar: When will gold league open? :D
 Scarfield: isnt that because you cast the spell, the spell aplies next turn, but only after reading the input of vel (that has not yet been updated, since the spell is only being cast this turn)
 struct: but why is threatfor updated?
 Scarfield: it kinda makes sense, not knowing where the opponent wants to control the monster i guess, untill it moves
 struct: if the spell hasnt been cast?
 Scarfield: thats the weider part i think
 orangesnowfox: legend has it that on struct's grave will be the words "but why is threatfor updated"
 struct: lol
 Scarfield: but either both should be updated, or none of them
 struct: yeah
 orangesnowfox: yeah, regardless of reason the lack of consistency is a bug
 orangesnowfox: or, feels like one
 Scarfield: and they look like bugs
 struct: afk
 aatj: It's definitely a bug. If it were a feature of the spell, it would be documented.
 struct: I think we can all agree its a bug
 struct: I dont think it will be fixed though
 orangesnowfox: yeah...
 LaurensD: lol I think my test in arena is bugged, it's stuck I think at 57%
 HoriMiyamura: no it isn't a bug
 orangesnowfox: LaurensD no bug, just a tons of submits
 HoriMiyamura: it is a feature @LaurentsD
 aatj: Hah
 LaurensD: ah alright, I thought it would have a empty field at top, with a loading indicator
 orangesnowfox: mm, regardless of UI silver just opened, which... uhh, means a lot of games that need to be played
 PatrickMcGinnisII: blasterpoard wth, u wind way out of bounds
 blasterpoard: PatrickMcGinnisII seems completely ok to me
 HoriMiyamura: The default code submit doesn't seem to help me to Wood1
 orangesnowfox: WAITing is... not a very good strat no
 PatrickMcGinnisII: blasterpoard it literally loaded the shotgun
 Wontonimo: HoriMiyamura there is a bunch of starter AI here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/tree/main/starterAIs">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/tree/main/starterAIs</a>
 Wontonimo: it's the published starter kit.  What lang are you competing in&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, still jumping +/- 200 rank 18% in
 HoriMiyamura: my colleague go to wood1 by default code, but I can't do the same. Where is the equality?
 Wontonimo: it's equity these days, not equality
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 HoriMiyamura: Thank Wontonimo, I don't notice the starter kit...
 sergod: Is there a difference in Silver league? I think it has the same contraints
 HoriMiyamura: yeah equity
 Wontonimo: using the starter code _and_ adding a sort to the monsters is a pretty good start
 orangesnowfox: sergod: better opponents
 HoriMiyamura: Thanks
 geppoz: question: in "Action order for one turn" it is specified that CONTROL and SHIELD (2-3) are applied before mana generation (5), then WIND is applied (6);  this means that WIND can be cast using the mana being generated in same turn&#160;? :D
 Wontonimo: then add a wind towards the enemy base if a bug is too close to your base, that'll give you another +200 ranks easy
 orangesnowfox: ... geppoz, that's... lemme check, I want to know
 Counterbalance: geppoz unfortunately no
 HoriMiyamura: starter doesn't sp cpp&#160;:(
 HoriMiyamura: I would use Java then
 Wontonimo: meh, if you like cpp then just copy the ideas.  it's simple enough
 HoriMiyamura: haha, yeah
 Wontonimo: java's garbage collection is a serious issue when all you have is 50ms imho
 orangesnowfox: tbh, you can get away with *python* in this game
 orangesnowfox: if you aren't simming
 Wontonimo: anyone else have opinion on java (who has actually used java here)
 Wontonimo: I'm using python atm (no sim)
 geppoz: Counterbalance so the mana is consumed in step 1 
 orangesnowfox: :raised_hand: I had to use Java for a HS class once, that *sucked*
 Nerchio: Wontonimo in hard calculation games you can't beat cpp but for everything its fine
 orangesnowfox: wrote a neat CLI calculator tho
 geppoz: and it run out in order of the 3 use
 Nerchio: everything else*
 orangesnowfox: ... That I ported from the same one I wrote in C++
 HoriMiyamura: so you mean python is better than Java for performance?
 HoriMiyamura: on CG platform?
 Wontonimo: no, hell no HoriMiyamura
 aatj: HoriMiyamura: If you watch MathisHammel's intro video, he basically goes through the python starter with some additions.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wontonimo , yup the kernel doesn't gaf .  but you can gc 
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, that isn't what I was saying at all
 orangesnowfox: ... *all
 orangesnowfox: wait, I did say it right :facepalm:
 orangesnowfox: But my point is that... If you're just doing heuristics (like myself) you don't really need to be all that fast...
 Scarfield: there could easily be python bots in legend this tournament i think
 Scarfield: "easily"
 orangesnowfox: as easily as any other language
 Wontonimo: I was just assuming that wanting to use cpp meant an interest in sim.  Both java and python are probably poor choices for that, first java's GC within 50ms and python's slowness
 avdg: hmm when I need a weak bot, I don't get any
 orangesnowfox: @Wontonimo, it could mean more comfort in C++, like, I use Rust and I don't sim
 aatj: I used Python, but I think a language with functional features would be perfect to calculate on a lot of entities at once, avoiding too many loops.
 Wontonimo: yeah, i assumed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the array filteering in java is a pain in the ass compared to PY and rust imo.  albeit dropping the old for loop and doing it yourself can be faster
 antiwonto: [auto] PatrickMcGinnisII be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 Scarfield: you should add an easter egg bad word to antiwonto, and change it from time to time :p
 orangesnowfox: aatj Kotlin is no joke fairly useful for compos if you like Javaesque languages
 Wontonimo: *a pain i the bottom/rear
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ass

 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh
 aatj: Yes, indeed. Thanks orangesnowfox
 aatj: Not allowed to talk about donkeys in here.
 orangesnowfox: a pain in the back or neck, is my preferred one. 'specially because that's where the pain tends to manifest
 Wontonimo: PatrickMcGinnisII , I like you but please don't encourage antiwonto and make it spam.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: antiwonto use tinyurls, you are spamming
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^
 MACKEYTH: 4% of silver battles done. This is gonna take some time
 orangesnowfox: lmao, my bot computes the entire set of actions in 1-4 microseconds 
 orangesnowfox: Sometimes its randomly 15 tho
 Scarfield: im at 27% but yea, ~200k games will have to take some time
 _NikJ: Wontonimo, why don't I see you in the leaderboard? Hiding before a fake account before busting out a winning solution?
 Scarfield: you can search for a name
 _NikJ: I do, but it's not showing me any results
 _NikJ: Maybe search died too
 Butanium: if my hero has isControlled = 1
 Scarfield: i find him when searching, 630 in silver, no idea _NikJ
 Butanium: it will ignore my order this turn right&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think it's only 40k games and it's 25% done
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623740171">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623740171</a> turn 110 monster 83 stuck?
 MACKEYTH: Yes, Butanium
 Aramang: i lost a match 748 to 736 wild mana lol
 Butanium: thanks MACKEYTH
 Scarfield: when a monster is inside a base area you cant push it out, i guess it stops at the border when you are pushing it cegprakash
 Scarfield: i havent tested this myself yet though
 cegprakash: RIP wind physics
 Ketroc: @ceg likely a mechanic of trying to push a monster out of bounds in the base zone.
 Scarfield: your wind would have to be along the x-axis to avoid this i bet
 MACKEYTH: That's right. Monsters in a base attraction zone are immune to going out of bounds
 Scarfield: i assumed it would still move the dx value, but seemingly not
 _NikJ: You guys using "cooldowns" on spells?
 orangesnowfox: Aramang how did you keep track of that?
 Scarfield: its shows in the kill screen
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ceg, looks like it clipped to wall because it was on the wall...1 px up and it shoulda worked fine
 geppoz: cegprakash monster y is already 8999, your WIND vector has a component y positive = pushed into border
 Aramang: orangesnowfox its in the output at the end of the match
 orangesnowfox: presumably only when it's tiebroken off of wildmana?
 Scarfield: yup
 Aramang: yeah if it reaches turn 220
 JackMc: Yeah seems the border in base zone is sticky
 Scarfield: euler shared a replay where he would draw eith wild mana
 PatrickMcGinnisII: push to 17630-15,8999-15 maybe
 Butanium: is that intended  JackMc&#160;?
 JackMc: I don't know, didnt write the harness&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: Aramang, the reason I asked is because I checked a game where I won on hearts (opponent took 1 damage) and I didn't see wildmana there lol
 orangesnowfox: found it on a different match though
 Scarfield: dang it, extra effort to my sim idea&#160;:/
 jordonez: "Append text after any command and that text will appear above your hero" - how is this? i'm getting bad command&#160;:(
 orangesnowfox: jordonez: `MOVE 0 0 your comment`
 Aramang: did you rememebr to put SPELL before WIND?
 jordonez: thanks!
 cegprakash: submits stuck at 1 game zz :P 
 LaurensD: @jordonez yeah, took a while to notice they ment it as after the command in the same line
 LaurensD: does make sense though after you know about it =P
 LaurensD: @cegprakash haha, mine at 70%
 jordonez: hahaha
 orangesnowfox: I personally wish they went with the `WAIT; SAY hi` style
 _NikJ: For the past 15 minutes I've been banging my head why my code changes aren't improving the play. TURNS OUT, external editor plugin crashed and I kept replaying the same code...
 orangesnowfox: but I get that you can only do one action, sooo
 LaurensD: @orangesnowfox  WAIT; hallo my name -- I would prefer that
 LaurensD: with ';' as indicator end of command
 cegprakash: _NikJ and in the process u broke the existing code as well :P 
 Kukiss: _Nikj copy/paste doesn't make such problems :D
 Th1nhNg0: hey guy, is there anything new in sliver rank&#160;?
 Scarfield: nope Th1nhNg0
 Th1nhNg0: thanks
 Scarfield: same rules from bronze and upwards
 Th1nhNg0: okay
 orangesnowfox: Th1nhNg0 "better opponents"
 Th1nhNg0: I will take my time to do some reinforcement learning xD
 Scarfield: gl
 Th1nhNg0: look like butcher2013 is not the bot any more =)))
 Scarfield: the leaderboard has not stabalized since silver opened, he is likely still in the top i think
 Th1nhNg0: oh
 Th1nhNg0: let see :D
 AlMualem: so now gold is open&#160;?
 HoriMiyamura: nooo
 orangesnowfox: AlMualem, nope, silver
 AlMualem: lols....and when gold will open?
 orangesnowfox: no clue
 Wontonimo: probly 2 days from now
 orangesnowfox: yeah, at least two days, no more than 4
 jrke: is everybody promoted to silver till the cut off or still few remaining?
 Scarfield: between 10 seconds and 40 years
 Wontonimo: i can't believe I've been coding python for 6 years and just now learn about math.hypot  /flip
 Scarfield: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Uljahn: i prefer numpy.linalg.norm though
 AlMualem: guys at the moment i am about 65%-35% winning the silver boss....i dont see any difference with the bronze boss...am i blind or crazy or either? :P
 AlMualem: *didnt make a single change to my code
 therealbeef: which silver boss?
 barbora: there is no silver boss yet
 AlMualem: AI* Default* whatever you prefer
 blasterpoard: AlMualem "default" is not the boss, just a random AI you can test agains, and it's the same in all the leagues above wood, bosses are copies of chosen players' bots
 Scarfield: Ai default is wood boss
 Eacaw: I'm getting this error: Warning: your code did not read all available input, does anyone know any typical causes? (JS)
 AlMualem: ok thanks for clearing this up guys
 AlMualem: much appreciated
 Scarfield: you didnt read all the available input :p
 Scarfield: have you changed the input reading loops or something?
 JohnyDaison: blasterpoard I don't think bronze AI is the same as silver AI, at least it didn't feel like it
 MACKEYTH: Eacaw possibly you outputted more than 3 commands last turn?
 Scarfield: that could be the cause as well ^
 Eacaw: Aye, that's what I am looking into now, it's entirely possible
 avdg: he premoved?
 Magicson: Hmmm Boss 2 is trying to cast a spell without mana game ends and I get a lose. Is this a bug or a feature :p&#160;?
 avdg: The question is, how did you get lost?
 MACKEYTH: I encountered that problem. Issue was an if where an else if should have been
 Magicson: I mean, I'm full HP and I get the following...Game Summary:Bad commandBOSS 2 failed a WIND: Not enough mana
 Miki09: share replay pls
 Magicson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623754424">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623754424</a>
 Miki09: Ohhh
 Eacaw: Mackeyth, it was indeed that, have reordered my state transition logic and it's all sorted, cheers!
 Miki09: you need to write "SPELL" before "WIND"
 Magicson: lmao, thanks!
 Miki09: np&#160;:-)
 ex_nihil: What is 'wild mana'? Doesn't seem to be tied to the actual mana pool
 Miki09: For every damage you deal outside base you get wild mana
 ex_nihil: Ok, thanks.
 Miki09: np
 Leeward: fml I was almost out of wood 2 on a puzzle, did some refactoring and my ranking went down :facepalm:
 HoriMiyamura: wild mana doesn't showed up on UI is this correct?
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 struct: too much work
 MACKEYTH: You could (laboriously) track your own wild mana, but your enemy's is a complete mystery.
 HoriMiyamura: I think we don't need to care wild mana though
 struct: you need in case of a tie
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, just try to get as much as you can.
 struct: But you dont know how much enemy has so
 HoriMiyamura: so nothing to do with wildmana actually
 ex_nihil: It's basically to disincentivize pure Turtling strats.
 HoriMiyamura: haha
 JohnyDaison: So your ranking will drop every time you send the code into arena. That's because new code always starts at the bottom of the league and has to fight its way back up. And your rank is updated continuously as that happens.
 struct: it wont drop if the bot is better
 HoriMiyamura: yeah
 JohnyDaison: It will temporarily.
 Leeward: I meant my final rank after battles dropped
 JohnyDaison: oh
 Leeward: after effectively changing nothing
 LaurensD: The boss is rather stupid in reverse isn't he
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623767767">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623767767</a>
 JohnyDaison: have there been significantly less people in the league when you last submitted?
 JohnyDaison: *fewer
 avdg: hmm, no full heath stat has been given about monsters right?
 Leeward: no just a few more
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/634a1783-deeb-4e06-868f-fb8ccfce376e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/634a1783-deeb-4e06-868f-fb8ccfce376e</a>
 Wontonimo: oops
 MACKEYTH: No, just current health. You can see max health in the monster's tooltip, fwiw
 LaurensD: rank 97 bronze :3
 LaurensD: cmon where is my silver entry
 iian: Hi! Anyone using some kind of simulation? I hardcoded a strategy, but it seems suboptimal...
 avdg: yeah, I saw the full health in the tooltip
 jacek: :upside_down:
 JohnyDaison: LaurensD have you fought the boss yet?
 ycsvenom: i am 1339th in silver :joy:
 Westicles: this guy typed up 40 pages on how bowling works for a puzzle
 ycsvenom: but nothing is new 
 Waffle3z: battle progress 30% already
 Waffle3z: only took 2 hours
 struct: mine is still at 10%
 struct: 2478 computing
 orangesnowfox: 10%? I'm still at 8 :p
 avdg: that is a big queue
 Waffle3z: Q
 avdg: and I want to resubmit now... I guess I better wait
 MACKEYTH: I've resubmitted like 4 times so far without ever getting beyond 30% of battles.
 BeGoodAgent: how do you pass the bot intro quest
 MACKEYTH: (resubmitting changes, not to hammer the battle calc)
 jacek: BeGoodAgent mad pod racing?
 BeGoodAgent: yes
 struct: Ok, I'm going to try the contest, if I'm needed ping me
 avdg: My bot now uses the 3 spells, though the spells that are not winds are used very rarely for now
 jacek: there is something about checkpointY checkpointY. you need to change to X Y
 BeGoodAgent: I did that
 BeGoodAgent: was that all
 MACKEYTH: Controlling enemy heroes away from monsters is really useful. My bot does quite a bit of it.
 jacek: then click test in arena
 jacek: BeGoodAgent be aware there is contest going on and servers are slow today
 MACKEYTH: I've found controlling monsters at the enemy base to be less effective, tho
 BeGoodAgent: Ahh ok
 ataya-codam: what rank is the boss in bronze?
 Waffle3z: 1
 ataya-codam: nah
 ataya-codam: you promote if you get a better rank than him
 JohnyDaison: do you mean rank or score?
 jacek: thats both 
 ataya-codam: i mean what rank do you have to end with to advance to silver
 DaNinja: 1
 ataya-codam: really?
 ataya-codam: I can see three people above the boss on the scoreboard
 RafaelSan: 0.1
 Scarfield: you have to rank above the boss when your submit has finalized
 SNick123: You have to win like a number of games to make stabilize there
 avdg: hmm gold in less than 45 hours
 dbf: avdg where is a timestamp for gold start?

 Ekaon: Someone has a clue about this error&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4df4e093-c280-4421-b216-ad74ff63fabd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4df4e093-c280-4421-b216-ad74ff63fabd</a>
 Ekaon: I achieved to create the .jar of the game using maven, but I'm not able to execute it
 jmpeg: Ekaon: I am not a java expert, but I managed it using the instructions in the brutaltester repository. My fork is here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/johnpage-agixis/SpringChallenge2022">https://github.com/johnpage-agixis/SpringChallenge2022</a>

 Alurian: battles still running slow huh
 jacek: or you are running fast :thinking:
 Ekaon: @jacek Lol
 Ekaon: @jmpeg thank you i'll check this&#160;!
 VizGhar: Alurian score of 2500 players is being recomputed... you need to wait 5+hours :P
 jrke: 2.5k ongoing submissions what else we can expect!
 jrke: atleast servers are responsing
 jacek: is Automaton2000 responsive?
 Automaton2000: depends on how much time do you think is a good summary
 Alurian: shouldn't have run my new code in arena then &gt;.&lt;
 jmpeg: Ekaon: if you remove the build section from the pom.xml in my repo, then you will get the error you mention.The build section alone isn't enough, you also need the CommandLineInterface class
 Alurian: it looked like it was finished
 Alurian: now i'm 1900 instead of 40 ;__;
 ganbat24: what is new in silver leagues?
 Alurian: nothing
 avdg: only the silver leagues and the players that promoted to it
 Alurian: just new boss
 avdg: and less newbies
 avdg: unless someone made a bug
 ganbat24: oh
 avdg: silver and higher don't have new game rules
 JackMc: how do we know higher wont have different rules?
 Alurian: Cause it's the same as previous events
 JackMc: OK cool, not done any before&#160;:)
 jrke: exact 2500 submissions!
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/LRJFEq_884do">https://prnt.sc/LRJFEq_884do</a>
 jrke: lets dance! :grimacing:
 _Hunty: im now gold, gg
 JackMc: ^^ king hunty
 Wontonimo: JackMc and Alurian , it's actually because when you enter bronze there is a pop-up message saying that these are the final rules
 Wontonimo: you probably dismissed it without reading
 Alurian: true
 Wontonimo: i almost did
 avdg: I guess almost everybody know how annoying popups are... so people stop bothering reading them (and maybe only remember the visuals)
 JackMc: ah right, guess I did dismiss that without reading :0
 ganbat24: Does control also override the spell?
 Wontonimo: it's in the rules on the left.  scroll down and read the 'advanced rules' area to see all the edge cases
 Wontonimo: it's iin the "Action order for one turn" and the "Technical Details"
 Wontonimo: lastly, you can also read the code directly <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022</a>

 ganbat24: i got 3500 lol
 avdg: ow I did missed that one
 Wontonimo: better than 6+ billion people who didn't even try ganbat24 
 Psyho: oh cool, new league
 Illedan: Cool indeed, but too many matches playing
 Psyho: yeah, just realized that the number of people in silver league is like the number of people in bronze 2 days ago
 Illedan: And all in progress
 Runner87: any idea how to use the shield&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: Protect your defenders from control
 Nerchio: run shielded bugs into his base
 Runner87: yes maybe is usefull for attack
 Runner87: but WIND has no effect on shielded bug? is correct?
 Waffle3z: shield opponent heroes so you can wind monsters past them
 ganbat24: id is 1 0 2?
 MACKEYTH: I tried that but never got it working very well
 LostDragon: is there a way to dump all the inputs of a game without  coding that myself? i mean, if replays exist, than there should be a way to also dump what the players received and sent, right?
 avdg: store all what you read in an array?
 avdg: or put the reader in a wrapper
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't trust the referee for threat assessments
 LostDragon: kind of counter to the hope of not coding that myself, but that is what i've done for the time being...
 H1ggsb0s0n: do you guys know when the gold and legend leagues open? I can't find the schedule...
 Alurian: tuesday 5pm gmt +2and im guessing thursday 5pm

 Jok55r: hi
 madninjaskillz: whats the radius on the fog of war?
 msumera: 6000 for the base, 2200 for hero
 madninjaskillz: im starting to think my distance calculation is bollocks lol
 nightwalkerinthedark: SUIIIIIIIIII
 msumera: i just noticed that one of my distance calculation functions has a bug and always returns distance from 1st argument to itself =&gt; 0.0
 msumera: hope fixing it will not make my bot worse
 ebdt3utrk74ki3l.: hi I am a girl btw
 jacek: oO
 ebdt3utrk74ki3l.: ...

 ebdt3utrk74ki3l.: hi
 Wontonimo: hey ebdt3utrk74ki3l. , you have been given a short time ouut for spamming.  You are welcome to come back but don't spam
 Jok55r: hello guys
 StarSkill3r: Hi :D
 VizGhar: Wontonimo already have some sim ready? how much time will it  take?
 Wontonimo: honestly i haven't done any new code for 2 days, and just have an if/else
 VizGhar: hmm same here
 Wontonimo: if (and thats a big if) I get the motivation, I think I'll invest the time to get brutaltester going locally and optimize hyperparameters of my if/else
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: your goal is at least legend?
 Wontonimo: possibly make a pseudo-attention network to choose between different strats depending on current state
 VizGhar: I'll stick with if/elses too most probably...quite busy week
 Wontonimo: yeah, very busy for me.  Tomorrow my son returns from uni, then Wednesday i'm flying to a  funeral and not returning till Monday
 VizGhar: uf...
 ZarthaxX: funeral
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: a friend of yours?
 Wontonimo: yeah, a really good guy.  Known him for 25 years.  He died of cancer after struggling for 4 years
 ZarthaxX: noooo
 ZarthaxX: so sorry wonto
 KiwiTae: rip
 AlMualem: may he rest in peace mate&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: hearing so many stories of people dying of cancer lately
 ZarthaxX: what is going on with that type of disease&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: thank thanks.  All's good.  It's a wake actually.  Actual funeral was 3 months ago.
 Wontonimo: ZarthaxX, i think it's more that "in the old days" deaths would be reported as "died of old age" where as now that just isn't a diagnosis
 Wontonimo: also, people used to die a lot younger of things like simple infections
 Astrobytes: sorry for your loss wonto
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry everyone for dumping that here.  Really, it's all good.  
 AlMualem: ZarthaxX apparently nothing...best you can do is to find it in a very early stage...thats why everyone should go for a check up quite often
 Astrobytes: not a problem, we're just being respectful 
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo yeah you got a point with the old days thing, true
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 ZarthaxX: AlMualem it's hard to get used to that routine of check up, but yeah
 AlMualem:&#160;:/
 AlMualem: yeah
 AlMualem: Guys is anyone here NOT working as a dev?
 Astrobytes: especially if your health service is in such a bad state you can't even get an appointment for being ill never mind a checkup...
 Astrobytes: AlMualem: me
 Wontonimo: A lot of people here are not devs
 struct: me
 MACKEYTH: Student, here
 struct: But i cant code
 Wontonimo: lol
 Astrobytes: lol shut up :D
 AlMualem: Astrobytes this is awful indeed and i leave in one of that type of country&#160;:/
 AlMualem: struct ....suuuush! :P
 Astrobytes: I believe everyone has a right to healthcare
 Astrobytes: anyway. lets not dwell on such things
 AlMualem: yes yes
 Astrobytes: not many people here that aren't devs that aren't studying CS/related subject though
 AlMualem: so...how about separating my strat to early and late game? you think that we get better results? I am thinking early strat more farming and late ultra abusing enemy's base
 KiwiTae: try it
 AlMualem: on it mate
 Illedan: Validate everything
 Bernard_Lowe: are battles are going slow for everyone else today?
 _NikJ: Well, silver came out, so server was kinda under pressure :D
 aCat: oh c'mon
 Astrobytes: Yes. I think silver is still computing since about 4pm
 _NikJ: yup, I'm at like 60% xd
 _NikJ: 64% since 4pm today :D
 Bernard_Lowe: Oh wow. Thanks. Just glad I'm not alone.
 Astrobytes: and people just keep resubmitting, which is completely helpful of course
 aCat: I'm in with just a few rules, and not interested in silver rank, but everything works so slow...
 aCat: Astro you have some proper search algorithm&#160;:&gt;?
 Abdi-29: is someone using cpp?
 Astrobytes: Hell no, bunch of ifs :D
 aCat: Aaaaa
 aCat: anyone
 Astrobytes: illedan does
 aCat: All people are about ifology
 aCat: no he does not ;p
 aCat: His ifs perform better than sim ^^'
 Astrobytes: oh lol really
 KiwiTae: im debugging my sim
 KiwiTae: currently can't target closest monster :joy:
 Abdi-29: if yes, did you use vectore? how did you sorted it?
 Astrobytes: I plan to sim a few things but not a full sim/search
 Wontonimo: me too
 aCat: I rewrote engine, debugged it
 KiwiTae: im still debugging :D
 aCat: and now I have no idea what to do with it&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I would use certain parts as required I guess
 struct: do something simple aCat
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/FOrQYE4">https://imgur.com/a/FOrQYE4</a>
 struct: make an attacker or something
 Astrobytes: seems rng and whatnot will get in the way with a lot of prediction
 aCat: struct I have simple bunch of ifs to get me to silver :joy_cat:
 Illedan: Nice img acat
 aCat: you aim at proper algo struct?
 Astrobytes: *way of

 struct: my code is 2 or 3 ifs
 aCat: My method of writing engine, 
 Illedan: 97 ifs in my whole code
 LaurensD: losing code is a b with working online lol
 Illedan: but that is the engine too
 Astrobytes: at least I have a version that actually stores everything I read today
 Wontonimo: wait till they rollout pay-to-play KReguieg&#160;;)
 LaurensD: when working online*
 aCat: Download input from the replays, and generate bunh of images 
 aCat: and compare proper result with my prediction ;p
 Illedan: Do you have full replay inputs?
 aCat: myInputs
 LostDragon: @Abdi-29 std::sort(begin(...), end(...), [&amp;](auto a, auto b){//compare strictly less than})
 Illedan: ah, yoiu error print it
 aCat: I rewrite them on stderr and got program to parse and make my 'input.txt'
 aCat: yep
 Abdi-29: ill try it
 Abdi-29: thanks lostdragon
 avdg: hmm, bad idea to do 6000 * 6000 times distance calculations (wrong maths that caused big numbers)
 KReguieg: @Wontonimo I would be fine with watching an ad or two as well. But i wouldn't pay to play at all. ^^
 avdg: just basically timed out my bot
 jacek: KReguieg by playing dice duel your gpu mines CG coins :v
 Wontonimo: i think better would be a folding-at-home solution ... if you want to compete, you provide CPU.
 simonmtr: Is there a way to set my base values when playing against the bot? For example that my base is in the bottom and not the top?
 Wontonimo: yes, center bottom
 Astrobytes: yes, use delete below the player avatars at the bottom and swap em
 Wontonimo: click on the delete for both you and bot
 Astrobytes: ^
 Wontonimo: then click the [+] to add them
 Wontonimo: first is top left, second is bottom right
 simonmtr: Oooh nice you can also play against other players this way? :upside_down: Thanks!
 Alurian: yes
 Kukiss: and also you can play your IDE bot agains the one submitted to arena
 Wontonimo: ^^ that!
 simonmtr: wow thats so nice, I did not know that&#160;:)
 jacek: and you can play yourself!
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: approx 5,000 bots across all levels.  That's a pretty good turn out.
 struct: Doesnt silver feel to big?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: bronze is the new wood.  wood is the new intro
 jacek: meh new league should be at most 10%
 IvesL: its always like that isnt it
 struct: 57 battles done
 struct: only 18%
 PatrickMcGinnisII: people are resubbing alot during the full recalc, that's messed up
 Wontonimo: maybe the new company that CG is part of want's to inflate placement in leagues

 struct: This bot shouldnt have passed to silver
 VizGhar: Brutaltester crashing with Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/logging/log4j/util/ReflectionUtil
 VizGhar: any idea why? I compiled it using mvn package
 Bbrainstormer: When do I get promoted&gt;
 struct: it should take a while
 struct: the servers are stuck
 Bbrainstormer: Alright
 VizGhar: Bbrainstormer about 5 hours?&#160;:) arena is full
 struct: you are optimistic
 Bbrainstormer: Just making sure there wasn't a button I needed to click or smth
 struct: I would say 10 hours+
 Waffle3z: we need more leagues if half of everyone gets promoted every time
 Waffle3z: 33 should be enough for now
 VizGhar: You still need reevaluate whole previous league
 VizGhar: ah... with 33 it should be good :D
 IvesL: take reference to the population in line racing
 IvesL: spring 2022 gold+legend should have around 1000
 VizGhar: after 5 years&#160;:)
 Mateuszone: how i can print how much mana i have
 Mateuszone:&#160;?
 _NikJ: mana is given as input
 _NikJ: there are 2 mana readings per turn, first one is always your mana
 GlaceCoding: base[0].mana
 VizGhar: anybody can help me with brutaltester? java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ReflectionUtil
 VizGhar: I've probably build it incorrectly?
 avdg: hmm how to create a snippet, I've been playing with github copilot a bit :p
 Mateuszone: print(base[0].mana) doesnt workj
 Darleanow: hello every1
 _NikJ: I just told you, Mateuszone, every turn, there will be 2 inputs regarding mana and hp, the first one is always yours
 Mateuszone: but i dont know ho wto print it out
 Mateuszone: im new to coding and i dim not sure if i understand it correctly
 Mateuszone: that input think
 Mateuszone: thing
 _NikJ: paste the code here, I'll explain it
 Ketroc: which they upped the game length.  With spiders always rising in health, an extra 20ish frames would likely remove 90ish% of the draws.
 madninjaskillz: VS2022 just auto suggested my new list should be called "EnemiesByRace" - should i be worried that my IDE is recommending ethnic cleansing?
 Mateuszone: i just need some examples of debbuging prints
 jacek: python?
 Mateuszone: to see whats going on inside because at the moment i dont know how to do that
 Mateuszone: in python
 jacek: print("xxx", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Glyptod0n: try the python starter kit

 Mateuszone: print("my_mana", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Mateuszone: it doesnt print the value
 jacek: my_mana without "
 Mateuszone: okey now i see
 Mateuszone: so i can print like that every varaible yes?
 Rikus: I have made two calculations, one one I was at 2% battles and another right now at 15%In both it gave me that it will take 24hs O_oUnless they decide to add moar servers
 Mateuszone: we can imort every standard python library?
 Wontonimo: I'm also trying to get the local brutaltest going and getting this
 Wontonimo: java -jar -Dleague.level=3 ./spring2022.jar -p1 "python bronze195.py" -p2 "python bronze239.py" -d seed=122205825 -sno main manifest attribute, in ./spring2022.jar
 Mateuszone: do you guys create classes?
 Wontonimo: any ideas why "no main manifest"&#160;?
 Mateuszone: or everyone is doing it in functional way? 
 Wontonimo: meh, classes-ish
 Wontonimo: certainly not industry coding.  just hacking
 SashaNukem: I am using CPP with classes and vectors 
 Mateuszone: how many lines you got?
 Mateuszone: i have 137 xd
 SashaNukem: ~415
 SashaNukem: XD
 SashaNukem: the classes take up ~ 200
 Wontonimo: got it, i used <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/johnpage-agixis/SpringChallenge2022">https://github.com/johnpage-agixis/SpringChallenge2022</a> instead of the "official"
 avdg: 1517 lines now, just added the last biggest chunk of new code
 _NikJ: Ugh, my brilliant mind took into account target hp when choosing who to kill first. But in such a way that I always leave low hp monsters alone and they end up in the base :D
 avdg: will switch to fine tuning, not sure how much code that can add
 Mateuszone: do you use some special math coordnate functions?
 avdg: for? I added some coordinates system that I don't use just now
 _NikJ: What was the name of that chrome plugin which would automatically run tests for you?
 avdg: pupeteer?
 avdg: dunno
 SashaNukem: does pastebin work in this chat
 Mateuszone: i wanted to make one hero offensive and then created a ranges of coordinates on which he will walk
 Mateuszone: but python seems to slow to use randint every time
 Mateuszone: to choose random mvoe
 Mateuszone: move
 _NikJ: CG Spunk, there we go
 struct: Does it even work anymore?
 avdg: hmm my new chunk of code added 1 ms to my bot's execution time (which is at least double the run time of a round which gets added on top)
 Mateuszone: and another weird thing is that i have checker if mana &gt;10 before i use any spell and even with that i got an error out of mana
 Mateuszone: and then i lose
 Mateuszone: why is that?
 struct: SashaNukem if what you are pasting has over 5 \n it should make a pastebin

 Mateuszone: ph
 Mateuszone: you are right
 Mateuszone: there is one checker missing
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Kukiss: MichExpatMattThe Silver launched 5-6 hours ago but the battles are still being processed.  I am 54% battles in progress after me Submitting to arena around the silver launch.
 Mateuszone: but this my_mana -= 10 might be unnecesarry
 Mateuszone: because a game is taking care of that
 IvesL: no it is for your next hero
 MichExpatMatt: Okay, that was going to be my next question, I'm only at 59% battle progress, and I rebooted just wondering if clearing my browser cache wasn't enough
 IvesL: if you have got only 10mana left, and you used a spell on hero 0, your hero 1 wont have enough mana but your current my_mana doesnt reflect until next turn
 jacek: servers are slow. youll better go back tomorrow
 Tuo: i dont have mana-=10 either and it never crashes, but maybe hero will skip a turn?
 MichExpatMatt: yeah, I was just thinking "guess I'll go play civ instead" or maybe some code clashes or something
 Abdi-29: is this the correct way to calculate distance?  int distance = sqrt(pow(base_x - (*it).vx, 2)) + pow(base_y + (*it).vy, 2);
 MichExpatMatt: not much point tweaking my algo repeatedly until I see how things end up
 Rikus: sqrt(pow(base_x - (*it).vx, 2) + pow(base_y - (*it).vy, 2));
 Rikus: sqrt if for the sum of both differences, and you were adding instead of sub on the Y part
 MichExpatMatt: Abdi-29 unless you care about postive/negative vector direction, you may want to square the absolute value of the difference before before adding and taking the sqrt. At least I've been doing that to always get a raw distance value regardless of which side of the map I'm on
 Abdi-29: ah i see. i didn't see that. thanks
 Abdi-29: Ill take a look of that. thanks
 LaurensD: waw refactoring the bot pretty much whole and it does not have any smart functionality yet or whatever lol I don't know how I could win this lmao
 LaurensD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623890855">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623890855</a>
 Mateuszone: can i run it in my ide?
 Mateuszone: like pycharm?
 IvesL: you need a chrome add on
 VociNur: Yes, in a game, on the left in Settings
 Kukiss: Laurens. first thing I see, you could try to run to monster with a unit who the closest, to do not loose time.Turn ~11, you took the furtherst one&#160;;)
 Kukiss: the left a space if 'defense'
 MichExpatMatt: @LaurensD wow. Looks like the default bots ran into a fog of war issue to run out across the map and let monsters overrun their base
 Kukiss: the left a space in  'defense'
 PatrickMcGinnisII: use distance constants, square them.  example BASE_RADIUS=5000; Instead use 25000000... and don't even use a sqrt in your code.  And a pow(-1,2) should still be 1...no abs required
 jacek: no exercising no abs
 MichExpatMatt: Is there a precision/optimization difference between sqrt vs using pow?
 avdg: LaurensD I can't find your bot&#160;:/ But I guess my ai would crush you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: numbers less than 9223372036854775807 shouldn't be a problem
 MichExpatMatt: ohhhh gotcha

 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/">https://clist.by/standings/spring-challenge-2022-34341526/</a>
 LaurensD: Thanks!
 Mateuszone: ive installed extension for chrome and i still cant click on at externalsourceeditor
 Mateuszone: external_source_editor option
 avdg: did you downloaded the local java plugin?
 avdg: at least, if you use cg local
 Mateuszone: the one from chrome store
 avdg: yeah, but you also need a jar file from github
 Mateuszone: where i can read some manual about that?
 avdg: because google disallowed plugins to have file system access
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jmerle/cg-local-app">https://github.com/jmerle/cg-local-app</a> I guess
 Mateuszone: thanks
 thekindboy: hey guys what are the best websites you use to practice coding plz i am new
 Mateuszone: so basically this game got some reserved names and if u give them input then game engine will provide a values for them?
 LaurensD: You are the controller that operates the actions of the heroes, it's pretty much that. Reading the console must be done in a specific order and you are expected to give a response also in a specific order (normal work flow)
 Mateuszone: so i cant change anything from mathis hammel video?
 Mateuszone: like for and while loops?
 LaurensD: while must be there because it must continue to give responses
 LaurensD: but other than that you can modify everything expect the order/requirements of the response
 Mateuszone: what u mean by order/requirements of the response?
 LaurensD: reading data from console, that must be in order
 Mateuszone: so basically all variables which are fro input function?
 LaurensD: there is also a 'for' loop through your hero's and that must also send one action for each hero
 Mateuszone: this one     for i in range(heroes_per_player):?
 Mamounedj: HELLO
 LaurensD: Yes
 MrMoustach: is there an arena problem&#160;?
 LaurensD: Go through those input() those must be in order
 LaurensD: and there must also be 3 times 'print("action")'
 Uemu: Hi, was there no addition in silver league&#160;?
 struct: hi, no
 LaurensD: @MrMoustach, Nope it's just slow because there came a new rank
 Uemu: Thanks
 MrMoustach: oh thank you
 Mateuszone: so is it a good idea to create classes with methods for heroes and spiders?
 LaurensD: it's your party, if you seem it fits your design sure why not. 
 Mateuszone: but python is not to slow to do that in class way?
 Uljahn: python is mostly ok, just don't do deepcopy
 LaurensD: No experience with python, so can't give a response on that. But could be fine ~
 LaurensD: overcomplicating stuff also with c# at this point&#160;:/
 LaurensD: *yolo*
 Mateuszone: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b46524f-10a4-4d42-b574-64f491f76720">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b46524f-10a4-4d42-b574-64f491f76720</a>
 KiwiTae: Mateuszone bad idea to post bot code during contest
 Mateuszone: why in print with spiders_ranked it print to console only one (thread,spider) pair
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 Mateuszone: its a shitty code xd
 Mateuszone: im a noob xd
 avdg: do we have spiders in this game? I thought we only had monsters
 Mateuszone: you are right but this shouldnt be the case that is just a name
 LaurensD: We got entities*
 Mateuszone: for i in range(entity_count): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cef18ab9-98bb-4827-96f5-331a5010a5ca">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cef18ab9-98bb-4827-96f5-331a5010a5ca</a>
 Mateuszone: and i append these entities to a different lists
 Mateuszone: but when i do print(spiders_ranked, file=sys.stderr, flush=True) i got only 1 record in a list
 LaurensD: ah, perhaps because there are no spider in range at that time
 LaurensD: you can only see spiders that is within your see range (not inside those smoke)
 LaurensD: or you see that by default this way; perhaps you can try a count for this; not sure how it works with python though
 LaurensD: ```print(len(spiders_ranked), file=sys.stderr, flush=True)``` I guess
 ashiknur: can I see those spider attacking opponents base when my hero's are not in see range?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nope
 LaurensD: nope
 MSmits: but you can abuse the symmetry
 avdg: the symmetry can indeed reveal a lot
 LaurensD: only around hero (the clear part)
 Astrobytes: wild MSmits appears :tada:
 avdg: hehe, I thought he wouldn't show up
 MSmits: hehe yeah, i only now started coding for real. well semi-real. I did what is in the video and improved a bit.
 Astrobytes: video?
 darkhorse64: 2625 submits rn, contest will end before we get a chance to submit again
 Astrobytes: Oh the starter intro thingy
 MSmits: yeah the introduction thingy, 20 mins
 avdg: my ai can already track things
 Astrobytes: didn't watch it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol Astrobytes, like wild mana
 avdg: now it's a matter to use it's info to the max potential
 MSmits: it's ok, first 10 mins you can skip, second 5 mins or so tells you some logic to use. Pretty basic. 
 LaurensD: mateuszone, congrats your bot can beat the default ai of silver: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623922463">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623922463</a> :laughing::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Astrobytes: only today did I make a bot that kept more than a few variables as input
 MSmits: isn't the default AI always the same?
 LaurensD: idk, there were multiple and some where good
 LaurensD: it changed since I got promoted to silver
 ZarthaxX: SMITO
 MSmits: hi ZarthaxX
 avdg: if there is no ai assigned yet, the default will take it spot
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 Astrobytes: I think default AI defaults to previous league boss past the wood leagues
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: yeah then it's different
 Astrobytes: zartho
 ZarthaxX: astrobyto
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 darkhorse64: It used to have a nice funny name also
 Astrobytes: :hugging:
 MSmits: I'll be in bronze when the submit is done at least... but....
 ZarthaxX: submits have been going for hours by now lol
 Astrobytes: The contests used to have names too darkhorse64&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Am I still computing since 4pm or whatever it was?
 Astrobytes: fking hell 82%
 ZarthaxX: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like 5.5 hrs now
 avdg: how to see how big the compute queue is?
 ZarthaxX: final days gonna be hell
 MSmits: I just got a message saying a cat is following me.
 Illedan: 3 and 4 have crashed their progress too
 darkhorse64: The current boss does not look smarter than the bronze boss. Yes, you are, 6+ hours submit for me
 darkhorse64: avdg: score -&gt; in progress
 Astrobytes: so much of this is a complete joke, I'm just here for the atmosphere now tbh :D
 MSmits: what is a joke besides the submit times?
 Zandy156: my wood II submit from 3 days ago is at 22% progress in silver
 Waffle3z: 28 have finished
 Astrobytes: MSmits: you haven't been following chat I see
 HenroLST: ,agic
 MSmits: no, i have not been very active the start of this contest
 darkhorse64: What puzzles me if the number of submits keep on increasing
 MSmits: been doing some vacation chores and relaxing
 MSmits: finished season 15 of supernatural finally&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: people just keep resubmitting
 Astrobytes: + new users
 Illedan: :angel:
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: the battles in the IDE are probably painful for the server as well
 MSmits: and they get precedence
 Illedan: Yeah, they are prioritized
 Astrobytes: yeah but you don't get many nowadays
 darkhorse64: resubmitting is useless without a basis to compare
 Astrobytes: MSmits: did you watch Picard yet? 2nd series playing now. And did you check out BCS?
 MSmits: BCS?
 Astrobytes: Better Call Saul
 avdg: if there was an inbrowser variant of the runner (meh, executables then have to be exported through wasm)
 MSmits: I didnt watch the whole of picard 2 yet, it came 1 episode at a time
 avdg: ofc, only works with code that doesn't need to be hidden
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've not bothered with either, I will watch when they are complete
 MSmits: if BCS has a new recently added season, i still have to watch it
 Astrobytes: It oes
 Astrobytes: *does
 MSmits: oh cool
 Astrobytes: only recently started I believe, this is the last one ofc
 MSmits: oh ok
 Astrobytes: (afaik)
 Astrobytes: WHAT ABOUT KIM is all we want to knopw
 MSmits: I am still hyped about the ending of supernatural. Man that show ran for 15 years. I only just graduated when it started
 Astrobytes: Never got into that. Thanks for getting me into BCS though
 MSmits: it's not bad, it has a road trip vibe, lots of humor and monster hunting
 MSmits: target audience is guys around 20-30 i think
 Astrobytes: I liked Grimm for humour and monster hunting, that was legit hilarious
 Astrobytes: Proper b-movie-material series
 MSmits: yeah Grimm is not that far from this, but the main character in Grimm is more of a family person. supernatural is about two brothers going cross country in an impala killing monsters. slightly different vibe
 Astrobytes: maybe I'll give it another shot at some point
 MSmits: But yeah BCS is cool. You just have to get over the fact that it's not breaking bad. It's its own show and good for other reasons
 kelium: hello, people&#160;:) :grin:
 MSmits: and in some parts of it, good for the same reasons
 Astrobytes: It's slower paced and character-focused in a way BB isn't. I think it might even be better in some ways than BB. Hard to compare.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: hi kelium
 Astrobytes: Like El Camino, totally blew the end of BB out the water for me
 Astrobytes: Far more interesting for a start
 Astrobytes: Poor Jesse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: vampire diaries into the Originals is better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then Legacies had potential
 apple124: e
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BB is like Ozark
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er other way around
 Astrobytes: Wut. Only vampire things that are decent (imo) are the Anne Rice movie ones plus anything involving Salem's Lot
 Astrobytes: Other way around PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: queen of the damned suck imo
 Astrobytes: didn't really follow ozark much though tbh, any good?
 MSmits: i didnt either
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: yeah, so did the book, nothing to worry about there
 pwahs: are the full rules for bronze available somewhere? I'm Rank 7 in Wood 1, but I guess it will take a few more hours until I can get promoted
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's a bunch of non-english series on netflix that kick butt, but it's hard to read them all the time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ozark after first couple of episodes starts to get good
 MSmits: In a way I like that netflix got me trying so much stuff that I can now quickly tell the difference between Chinese, Japanese and South Korean content.
 MSmits: a lot of it is SK btw, for some reason. Could be the algorithm thinking I like that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Amazon prime throws so many 1 star B movies in the mix, it's so frustrating
 MSmits: netflix does too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they keep increasing prices, and are delaying series seasons on purpose...jerks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I like watching DUST on YT while on CG
 Astrobytes: I er... try before buying so I don't waste money
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's why i need a new GF
 Astrobytes: she doesn't like piracy?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I try and won't buy, lol
 Astrobytes: shocking Patrick, just shocking :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Last one I wed... well, she grew fangs
 Astrobytes: Garlic, heard that works well
 Astrobytes: Dude, you live in FL ffs, move :D
 MSmits: oh, yeah in FL things have fangs
 MSmits: I heard everyone has a pet alligator
 MSmits: or something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pet mosquitos the size of cats, lol
 Astrobytes: viruses don't exist, wrestling gators is a pastime and women have fangs. Correct.
 MSmits: really small cats too... amazing
 Astrobytes: "cats are small - but not as small as spiders" - My Mother
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my ide code beats people in top 100, but i dare not submit
 Astrobytes: wait for everything to stabilise, if it ever does
 MSmits: has it ever been this bad, this far into the contest? I remember this on the first day or so
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've gotten stuck in silver b4 because i didn't, but i don't care anymore.  going shopping. glhf.
 MSmits: oh yeah and i guess on the last 1-2 days with massive submits
 Astrobytes: for me, it's been heinous until they reduced the number of matches played in bronze
 MSmits: hf PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: some players are waiting to submit their legend bots, i can tell
 MSmits: well i am with 740 people in wood1 and ranked 1 above boss at 51
 Astrobytes: enjoy shopping PatrickMcGinnisII, remember to get a new GF when out shopping with the GF :D
 struct: MSmits the problem is that they used the old way of promotion
 struct: Where everyone that got promtoed resubmits
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: oh yeah that's not good
 struct: instead of just making everyone next league and keep same elo
 Astrobytes: they didn't just transfer like the last few times
 MSmits: oh right, it's this bad because silver just opened?
 struct: When the people that got promoted is aroudn 2k
 struct: and the games you play are 100 again
 struct: its too much
 Astrobytes: 2246 in silver rn
 MSmits: holy
 MSmits: crazy
 struct: I was promoted maybe 1 hour after silver opening
 struct: my submit is at 23&#160;%
 Astrobytes: I think 100% are still computing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: too many games going to 220 ... 153 matches at 89% now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, shop, c ya
 Astrobytes: struct: yeah, I'm at 87%, not sure how long after opening it happened but that was a Long Time Ago
 struct: 2,556 results found for «Score - Computing»
 Astrobytes: 100% of silver I mean
 Astrobytes: so yeah
 struct: how can yours be at 87
 struct: and mine at 23
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: did I promote before you?
 struct: probably
 Zandy156: it looks like 120 in silver are stable
 Astrobytes: even the promotion was strange, I attempted to go off and do codejam 1B but couldn't concentrate
 Astrobytes: I suck at limited time contests, felt like an exam I never studied for lol
 Astrobytes: (short time)
 PythonPlusPlus: When does the Gold League start?
 Astrobytes: christ silver just opened and already gold questions!
 Astrobytes: probably about 2 days or so
 Lysk: when computing is done then&#160;;)
 PythonPlusPlus: I'm itchin' to make it to the highest league. I was hoping that I could do it over the weekend, but that apparently wasn't possible
 avdg: submission is faster now, got 10 from the start
 Astrobytes: Lysk: :D
 struct: avdg you always get 10
 struct: and those 10 are prioritized I think
 avdg: ah
 avdg: but at least, they come through
 PythonPlusPlus: I didn't get 10 when I submitted
 Astrobytes: PythonPlusPlus: no but if you strive to be at the top now, chances are you will be promoted
 Astrobytes: if good enough to stay up there
 PythonPlusPlus: I'm thinking of rewriting my bots. My current strategy got me as far as 600th place, but it is really weak to shield campers
 avdg: currently I have to move some code to libraries, so I have less code to move around, but a lot of code is already quite ordered well already
 Astrobytes: i would recommend to do it asap while you can still get some games against top part of the league
 Wontonimo: oh, that's good advice&#160;!
 Wontonimo: haha, I left for a few hours and my bot which I submitted about 5 hours ago is still computing, only 89% done
 HenroLST: geez
 avdg: luckily computers aren't doing everything in our world of today&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: same wontonimo, 89% and I hadn't submitted for a few hours
 Wontonimo: oh!  Another battle for me started&#160;!
 Astrobytes: avdg: :grin:
 geppoz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623902548">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623902548</a>
 Astrobytes: nice to see you around again btw avdg
 geppoz: someone can explain the direction of the spider 83 in round 120&#160;?
 avdg: I probably have to go around now, tomorrow work
 geppoz: it was CONTROLLED toward enemy base, the WINDED a couple of times, then changed completely direction in SW&#160;?
 avdg: but yeah, I'm having a good start despite being busy with work
 Astrobytes: all good, any spare moments and you know where to come :D
 PythonPlusPlus: Any tips for dealing with shield campers? Currently my strategy is to stop them from crossing the half way divider, but that heavily drains mana. I'm thinking of maybe routing spiders around the enemy heroes
 madninjaskillz: rerun code: no red in the timeline...is this it, can i finally beat Pierre31? no. theres no red on timeline because my code is bugged and i failed instantly. embrace depression.
 HenroLST: rip
 Wontonimo: play the camper you don't like against someone higher and look at how they deal with it PythonPlusPlus 
 PythonPlusPlus: Good idea
 avdg: I love how my ai defends
 Wontonimo: glad you like it
 HenroLST: burh why my code hate me:cry:
 Wontonimo: that is a pretty good defence avdg
 Astrobytes: because you do not love yourself HenroLST, therefore all your code will be against you :rofl:
 avdg: oh rip that
 HenroLST: i feel like that's deep but at the same time
 HenroLST: ...
 Astrobytes: it's a deep p*ss take yeah
 HenroLST: not me struggling in wood 2 :grinning:
 Astrobytes: focus, you'll get there
 HenroLST: i had it working, then i changed to target the closest monster when none are targeting my base, and now it just randomly stops outputting MOVEs
 Astrobytes: review your code, you've made an error somewhere. Screen-break, look at it again
 HenroLST: hmm, ill take a break and do my physics like i was originally planning to do :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: that's a very good idea
 avdg: I find it easier to work with versioning (backups, or using a version control system like git, or an editor that keeps track of history)
 geppoz: well, there is a unsaid rule that a spider WINDED out the base are, picks a random new direction?
 geppoz: *area
 Astrobytes: geppoz:If a monster is pushed (with a WIND command) outside the radius of a targeted base, it will stop targeting and start moving in a randomly selected direction.
 geppoz: oops it is not "unsaid" then :D
 Astrobytes: geppoz: R T F S :D
 Wontonimo: read the forbidden statement&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: *forgotten *fiendish 
 Astrobytes: at least not frobnicating 
 Astrobytes: we have had those in the past
 Astrobytes: or frobnicated, delete according to your preference
 HenroLST: any idea why this might appear: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 geppoz: you wrote more than 3 row in one turn
 Jason_Down: Late to the party and had a couple hours this afternoon. I figured I could try to get up to bronze at least as a first go. It's been nearly 2 hours since I submitted my first attempt at Wood 2 and it's only 76% through the battles ugh :disappointed: There's 58 of us ahead of the boss, just let us through please :sob:
 struct: you are either outputing before reading all inputs
 struct: or you are outputing more than 3 times per turn
 HenroLST: ah, ok, thanks!
 struct: It doesnt tell you if you output 4 times
 struct: but the  output will be queued into next turn
 struct: which will make it go out of sync
 Astrobytes: Jason_Down: the silver league opened and it's caused a huge backlog since there are wayyyy too many battles computing at the same time
 Jason_Down: Yeah I figured it was bad timing on my part
 Jason_Down: Should've started yesterday
 HenroLST: yay solved it, thanks struct!
 Waffle3z: up to 83% after 7 hours
 Jason_Down: damn
 Astrobytes: and no chance of any action by staff since it's Sunday (or Monday in France and some other places)
 Jason_Down: Need some autoscaling on the servers&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: 96%!!!! :tada:
 Jason_Down: noice
 Astrobytes: 4:19PM
 Waffle3z: or just switch everyone above a certain rank to the next league and don't recalculate over 2000 bots at the same time for the rest of the day
 Jason_Down: I just jumped to 80%. Maybe I'll have a chance to get to Bronze before I need to call it a day.
 HenroLST: dang this opponent just sent 2 of his hero's to camp my base.
 Astrobytes: Waffle3z: I don't know why they regressed to this way of doing it since the last few contests they just literally moved everyone into the next league
 Jason_Down: I guess I'll check back in an hour. Good luck everyone.
 Kukiss: I wonder, would it be better for server if Silver was smaller?
 Astrobytes: and to you Jason_Down
 Astrobytes: Kukiss: see my previous comment
 Wontonimo: would have been better if the referee was *faster* AND only 20 battles when the promotion first happened.  No real need for accurate placement on initial drop
 Astrobytes: They started to simply transfer the 'quota' as it were into the next league, and now for whatever reason are no longer doing this
 Astrobytes: Perhaps it was an unnecessary expense
 Wontonimo: really, is 160 battles necessary at this point?
 Wontonimo: i don't think so
 Astrobytes: it just seems careless tbh, the past 2 contests (3?) used the simple transfer to next league way
 icecream17: Let's go I finished variable initialization! First submission! Rust is hard
 Kukiss: I see, these decisions are indeed interesting
 Astrobytes: icecream17: Rust is not hard, you are Rust-resistant. Let yourself rust
 madninjaskillz: i just got beaten by someone who used the tags above heros to scroll the lyrics to rickroll. talk about rubbing salt into the wound.
 icecream17: yeah I'm a beginner
 Wontonimo: galvanized  
 HenroLST: geez
 icecream17: ooh that's awesome. I think I'll do that too
 Astrobytes: icecream17: I know, hence my advice!
 icecream17: nice pun
 Astrobytes: It's a very different way of working
 Astrobytes: lol wonto
 Wontonimo: after you get comfortable with rust, move onto NNs
 Wontonimo: just so you never get comfortable with one way of doing things 
 icecream17: I suspect my code isn't that rusty
 c0r3dump: @icecream17 Fighting against the Rust borrow checker is super hard at first but after a while it's the best thing there is.
 Astrobytes: NNs ofc being Nickel Nanomeshes
 geppoz: anyway I think there is an error in the statement&#160;;)
 geppoz: in the step description it seems the CONTROL direction is calculated as first, before the spider moves
 Wontonimo: because I hate myself, I'm resubmitting my bot with only a minor change
 geppoz: instead it seems to me that is calculated after the spider moves (step 7)
 Astrobytes: control is applied on the next turn
 Astrobytes: well, is applied but effective on the next turn
 geppoz: yes, it is effective next turn
 geppoz: but the direction is calculated after the spider move, not before
 Astrobytes: in the referee
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 geppoz: I'm not looking at the referee, just noticing in games
 geppoz: yes, I should check that
 Astrobytes: well, don't trust the viewer from turn to turn lol
 Astrobytes: look at the statement, inputs/outputs and ref
 geppoz: I dump the coordinates on stderr
 Astrobytes: yeah, they don't match up with viewer frames usuallly
 Astrobytes: well, not as nicely as they should rather
 Astrobytes: but defo check the ref
 Zhme: anyone using C++?
 Astrobytes: nah, we're using python and pretending
 Zhme: good stuff
 Astrobytes: if you have a question just ask it
 Astrobytes: people will try to help
 Zhme: just wondering if anyone had a suggestion for a type to hold entity data
 Zhme: never done this before
 Astrobytes: a struct would be fine
 icecream17: it seems like there's a limit of 98 monsters, is there?
 Astrobytes: during these contests you don't need to get too hardcore with the 'proper way to do things' so making everything public isn't much of an issue unless you plan to send your code to someone else for review lol
 Astrobytes: @Zhme
 Zhme: thank you!
 Astrobytes: You could have a vec2d struct, then inherit from that, or just use it in your entity struct
 Astrobytes: etc etc
 Astrobytes: use whatever is comfortable and works
 Tuo: vec2d class with overloads and you wont know where vector math ends and begins :D so much fun
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: templates!
 Runner87: monster shielded  moves with WIND?
 geppoz: no
 Astrobytes: shield prevents effects of spells on the shielded unit
 ashiknur: testing in arena taking too much time.
 ashiknur: is the default AI of bronze and silver league is the same?
 Astrobytes: ashiknur: it will presumably get faster at some point during Monday
 ashiknur: is the default AI of bronze and silver leagues the same?
 Astrobytes: Opening of silver league was somewhat stressful on the servers
 Astrobytes: I think the default AI of silver is the bronze boss
 ashiknur: that means we have to beat the same boss or will it change?
 Astrobytes: and so on, down the leagues
 Astrobytes: in silver?
 ashiknur: yeah
 Astrobytes: A new boss will be chosen as it was in bronze, then you have to beat that to get to gold
 Whatar: How is the boss chosen?
 Astrobytes: wood bosses are premade, the bosses from bronze onwards are handpicked by staff
 Whatar: cool
 Astrobytes: as in handpicked from the users in the league
 Djellowman: can i have multiple files?
 Djellowman: i seem to only get 1 file
 Astrobytes: you get one file. You can write or use an existing script to combine your files into a CG-friendly format
 Djellowman: thank you
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: there are a few ready-to-go 'bundler' scripts around if you search the forum, depends on your language but there are a few
 Djellowman: another type of question; do you think it makes sense to keep track of both players' wild mana?
 Djellowman: since it seems to be a win condition if both players defended everything
 Glyptod0n: for the detail "its coordinates are truncated (when below halfway across the map) or rounded up (when above halfway across the map)"
 Glyptod0n: it's from perspective of your base right
 Astrobytes: I would try to maximise mine and overall gain advantage elsewhere, that should prevent the need to keep track of what the opponent got in that respect, but don't take my word for that in any way, just a thought
 Astrobytes: Glyptod0n: It's supposed to be symmetric so yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: seriously 92%... I went shopping...omg
 Glyptod0n: thanks
 burnpanck: Djellowman you won't be able to track wild mana of the opponent - most of the time you don't see when the opponent fights a monster, and you can't tell from the opponents "normal" mana either because you don't see the spell use
 Astrobytes: lol Patrick
 Astrobytes: burnpanck: yeah, it's possible to make guesses but I feel it's a futile endeavour
 Djellowman: ah i missed the fog mechanic
 Djellowman: i had assumed full knowledge
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 mobs spawn every 5 turns beginning on turn 3, their hp=potential mana.  their hp starts at 10 and goes up by     1 every 10 turns
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can only guestimate
 Astrobytes: Djellowman: it would not be CG without fog these days it seeems
 Astrobytes: or seems
 Djellowman: is it because games are too easy to solve with full knowledge?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes the cpu grinders have a distinct advantage
 Astrobytes: To a point
 Astrobytes: I mean, there are parts of this game that are fully searchable, so expect it
 Djellowman: why can i only see enemy output stream sometimes?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: true, but not as bad as some previous combo finding games
 Astrobytes: I like search-based, I like some heuristic + search based too
 Jason_Down: Well then... came back to find things have sped up nicely. I moved to Wood 1 finally and am about to move to Bronze without any code changes. That makes up for the 3.5 hour wait :beers:
 Djellowman: does the very first input line contain our mabna, health
 Astrobytes: Jason_Down: :beers: nice one!
 Djellowman: or our enemies mana, health
 Djellowman: nvm
 Astrobytes: @Djellowman: yeah sorry, first input is yours
 Astrobytes: regardless if you are p1 or p2
 Djellowman: just found it in docs. i was surprised because the default code actually ignores the 1st line and stores the second as health, mana variables
 Astrobytes: in what lang?
 Djellowman: python
 Astrobytes: no it doesn't
 Djellowman: for _ in range(2):
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I like games needing a little intuition
 Djellowman: default code
 Djellowman: just overwrited the variables
 Djellowman: overwrites*
 Astrobytes: I know I'm looking at it.You have to store it, it's only reading it
 Djellowman: i just found the 'starter kit'. would've saved me some boilerplate writing ;p
 Djellowman: exactly the setup i went for
 Jason_Down: Ooooh two more spells. I haven't even coded the wind spell yet 
 Tuo: still not great default code, they could have done two lines one for own and one for opponent
 Astrobytes: did they do a c++ starter this time around?
 Astrobytes: Tuo they generally do it like this, kinda normal for CG
 Djellowman: are monster spawn randomly? if i play my code i get differing results
 Djellowman: do*
 yhyoxx: yes
 Astrobytes: I'm trying way hard not to just say RTFS rn
 Astrobytes: but:Monsters will appear randomly, but symmetrically from the map edges outside of the player's bases. They appear with a random moving direction.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rtfs?
 Astrobytes: manual play with the same seed should fix that if you need it
 Astrobytes: Patrick: Statement not Manual
 Astrobytes: RTFS vs RTFM
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pos and dir only rnd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahhh, yup
 Djellowman: sorry, i did a ctrl+f for 'random', but apparently hadn't selected the manual window
 Astrobytes: Read the &lt;word beginning with F&gt; &lt;Readable Material&gt;
 Djellowman: wait i had a ctrl+f on 'spawn', thats why
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, ... RTFD
 Astrobytes: Djellowman: heh heh, it happens
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;directions&gt;
 Astrobytes: I assumed that one Pat
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: you prefer Patrick, Pat or Paddy?
 Djellowman: sorry i never used this site before. but yeah it's all in the docs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Pat²
 PatrickMcGinnisII: doesn't matter
 Astrobytes: all the Patricks I know have a preference lol
 Astrobytes: Djellowman: always best to check for sanity reasons, and welcome to CG&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Pat jr. will make me fly to where you are and chastise you vehemently while drunk
 Djellowman: Pat jr. it is
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: :rofl: should be fun in Scotland :D
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII gathers his pipe b*mb materials, j/k</b></p><p><img src="/a/75707267075165" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: fixin' to be too hot here in FL anyways
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: they're needed in the homeland rn I believe mate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gonna start a gofundme for a pair of waverunners
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 93%
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gagh
 Astrobytes: anyways, I gotta run, Past 1am here and I have stuff to do in the morning.
 Astrobytes: Take care all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 Djellowman: gn
 Djellowman: i just realized the BM potential of appending text after commands
 Djellowman: you can taunt enemy heroes as you control them around
 madninjaskillz: ive been rickrolled twice with that text.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: other people have quoted poetry, spit variables, etc.
 yhyoxx: or advertise their website
 yhyoxx: dude is even including '<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://&#39;">https://'</a>
 Djellowman: spit variables?
 yhyoxx: print a var content
 yhyoxx: value*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: spit eminem
 Djellowman: would it work to just have all 3 of your heroes walk up to the monster the closest to the enemy base
 Djellowman: and then triple wind them into the base. repeat 3 times..?
 MACKEYTH: It's a risky strat, but there's at least one player I know of who did exactly that.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it only takes 2 to shotgun one into base
 Djellowman: does it? it's 2200 units per wind. so i guess it depends on the distance
 PatrickMcGinnisII: +300
 Djellowman: you could keep one for defense perhaps
 Djellowman: ah you're right. so 4700 total with 2 WIND casts. with the base being 5000 from the border
 Tuo: maybe you could go in the start when only few spiders, sling 1 - 3 in and then 3 hero defense
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 4700+1280 for hero loc
 Djellowman: it gets completely countered by anyone shielding enemies when opponent heroes are near
 Djellowman: i don't see why you add the 1280?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wind radius
 Djellowman: ah yes your hero can be farther away
 Djellowman: if that's what you mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er range
 Djellowman: the monster has to be in 4700 range though
 MACKEYTH: Just made another big commit. fingers crossed.
 erick.lee: i can't concentrate on my job because of this game&#160;:(
 yhyoxx: you should quit
 erick.lee: ye.. i will quit to see more
 MACKEYTH: Anyone know of a good resource that can show you the differences between 2 documents?
 yhyoxx: online diff checker&#160;? 
 MACKEYTH: Yeah
 yhyoxx: google those 3 words
 MACKEYTH: I know, i know. already done.
 NinjaDoggy: I agree with yhyoxx, you should quit your job erick.lee&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: :P
 YiCao: Any differences between Silver League and Bronze League? 
 Wizard-Dude: none other than the boss will be significantly harder
 Wizard-Dude: basically to weed out everyone other than the best for legend leauge
 YiCao: OK, got it.Thanks for Wizard-Dude:grin:
 yhyoxx: jobs give you a reason to wake up tho
 yhyoxx: along with other things
 Skm11: I need help
 yhyoxx: what's wrong&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: Do monsters move an aditional 400 units after wind command&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: nope, monster don't move after getting pushed
 DollarAkshay: TY
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's vector math
 yhyoxx: they pick a random direction after being winded, right&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if not in a base
 DollarAkshay: Only if they are outside the base radius
 yhyoxx: do we farm wild mana if monster is in enemy base&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: Doesn't matter where the monster is. You get wild mana if your hero hits a monster while outside your base
 yhyoxx: nice
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lline 568 of referee, u decide
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like it
 NinjaDoggy: i'm pretty convinced wildmana is a bait to track&#160;:/
 NinjaDoggy: I don't think it's possible to survive in this game to 220
 abt8601: You can blow the monster away from the base if there are too many
 MezNova: what language does this website teach?
 EvModder: java.util.Random.... seed cracking time?
 yhyoxx: @EvModder good question
 EvModder: The seed is only really useful for knowing the starting vx,vy for all monsters
 EvModder: but that's pretty useful
 EvModder: the biggest barrier to cracking it is that the mob speed vector gets truncated, so we lose a LOT of double precision (meaning we have a LOT of candidate double values)
 EvModder: however, perhaps with enough aggregate data... (search spaces is theoretically halved each time we see a new mob), we can get the number small enough to brute force the seed
 ItsNotABug: Any top tips for someone just starting spring challenge?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: direction is randomized on wind
 EvModder: to crack the java.util.Random seed you literally just need to know a single result of nextDouble()
 EvModder: yeah, but you can detect wind spells pretty easily and account for it
 EvModder: even if outside your fog of war, by just watching opponent's mana
 Aramang: what if they use control in fog?
 abt8601: EvModder does java.util.Random use linear congruence generator?
 EvModder: yes
 EvModder: quick google search yields this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/fta2012/ReplicatedRandom">https://github.com/fta2012/ReplicatedRandom</a>
 EvModder: @Aramang control doesnt call random.next*(), and if i understand correctly it also doesn't permanently affect vx,vy, which is all we need to crack the random
 Wontonimo: you don't need to put the @ infront of names EvModder
 EvModder: Ah, wasn't sure how it worked because it doesn't highlight it for me when i tag someone else
 EvModder: I think the hardest part of cracking the game seed is dealing with the truncation mob vx,vy... but even so
 EvModder: am I allowed to create a 2nd account (for simulating only) that will stay at the bottom of wood league?
 EvModder: I won't ever submit it, just in ide
 EvModder: I want to test a few games without fog of war
 EvModder: (alternatively, if anyone knows an option to disable fog of war in IDE...)
 AIonymuOS: Any tips on when to activate shield in Mad Pod Racing?
 JulienKerlero: Any tips on how to farm multiple spiders ar once&#160;?
 Waffle3z: it's been 12 hours, is silver done computing yet?
 abt8601: I see only 50 players whose scores are computing right now, so maybe we're close to done
 Lysk: it's quite fast now
 Waffle3z: still can't watch any replays, it's just blank
 DollarAkshay: Check the forums someone was complaining about this
 DollarAkshay: I think there might be a solution in the Forums
 Waffle3z: nothing in the latest section
 DollarAkshay: @Waggle3z <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/5">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/5</a>
 DollarAkshay: Is this the same problem&#160;?
 Waffle3z: yeah figured it was something that only started today due to load
 Waffle3z: not firefox though
 EvModder: what c++ version is codinggame using?
 EvModder: the keyword "consteval" seems unrecognized
 Lysk: g++ 10.2.1 mode C++17 =&gt; g++ 11.2.0 mode C++17
 Lysk: (latest language update)
 EvModder: booo
 EvModder: give us c++20
 EvModder: where do i formally complain lol
 EvModder: who even uses c++17 anymore xD
 EvModder: (joking, but not entirely)
 Ketroc: java is still on 1.8&#160;;/
 EvModder: damn
 EvModder: well at least with java, you guys have a standard library that contains more than just dust and cobwebs
 EvModder: c++ is kind of garbage without boost/absl libraries
 EvModder: we can all envy the python guys who have a library for literally anything pre-built in
 PaulBunyan: It's not the size of the libraries... it's what you do with them....
 ItsNotABug: Just started, made my guys attack the closest enemy or closest thats a threat and rapid promotion :D 
 PaulBunyan: That should get you to Bronze very quickly.  To get to Silver you have to start using spells.
 ItsNotABug: Yeah, just want out of wood to start getting more rules. No point wasting effort before then
 EvModder: PaulBunyan my counter argument is C. Imagine having to implement maps &amp; dynamic arrays (vectors) yourself each time you needed them
 EvModder: I want consteval, which is c++20 while website is c++17. Sure, I can do without, but why should I be forced to?
 PaulBunyan: Joke dude.
 EvModder: If Java is really 8 like Ketroc said (instead of Java18), imagine all the basic stuff they miss
 EvModder: ah ok my bad lol
 EvModder: hard to pick up on joke/sarcasm in text&#160;:)
 PaulBunyan: No worries.
 struct: They tried to add other java versions but it timed out randomly
 struct: So they rolled back
 EvModder: Ah ok
 EvModder: I bet there's a JVM config setting they could tweak to fix that
 EvModder: but probably requires some investigating so i get it
 EvModder: c++20 is greatly missed tho&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so your lazy, my codesize is 700 with OOP. And I'm hardly done, and left many things undone
 Jerrasterix: I was in 1200th rank and I still got promoted to silver WTH&#160;??
 EvModder: my submitted code is ~200
 Jerrasterix: mine is like 180
 EvModder: ikr Jerrasterix, I was surprised too 
 EvModder: I haven't submitted code since day 1 xD
 struct: Jerrasterix I was 1979
 PaulBunyan: 116 lines of python and I'm in Silver.
 EvModder: I've been stuck on something in IDE for last 2 days
 struct: I think too many got promoted to silver
 Jerrasterix: agreed struct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I agree struct, I was one of them
 EvModder: oh struct you're a moderator
 EvModder: can you answer a rules question for me..
 struct: If I know it
 struct: I'm just a chat moderator but I can try
 EvModder: I think I know a way to crack the game seed from within the submission
 EvModder: meaning i can predict monster movement vectors before actually seeing them
 EvModder: however i haven't actually managed to get it working yet
 EvModder: and it is not easy
 struct: hmm, are you sure it's possible
 EvModder: it's the reason i haven't submitted to arena in 2 days.. I'm deep in theory-land of double-precision
 struct: I know it has been done before
 Jerrasterix: I think some have already tried it but for other multis
 struct: But they increased the seed to prevent this
 struct: before seed was 32 bits now its 64
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can view the first two mobs easily, because you have 3 turns to get one hero on each edge
 EvModder: java.util.Random, which is what the engine uses, gives away 48 bits of the seed when generating nextDouble()
 EvModder: and you can bruteforce the last 16 bits very easily
 PatrickMcGinnisII: seed starts as a long, but pulls doubles
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh apparently I was good enough for silver
 struct: I would say it's fair game if you manage to do it
 BenjaminUrquhart: also what's this, trying to break java random?
 EvModder: if you know a single double from rand.nextDouble(), you can predict all future doubles
 EvModder: eg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/fta2012/ReplicatedRandom">https://github.com/fta2012/ReplicatedRandom</a>
 EvModder: the tricky part is the game doesn't tell you any exact double from nextDouble() -- it gets converted into vx and vy for 4 spiders spawned every 5 turns, so the search space depends on how much precision is lost in the truncation to int
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think you need 2, but you can see 6 on turn 3
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 6 normalized doubles
 EvModder: a single nextDouble() is all you need because internally nextDouble() calls nextInt() twice i believe, for upper and lower bits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: turn 8 should give you the lower bits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's easy to see where on the board is gonna be farm territory and vulnerable territory.  Fog just kills running chess style sims
 EvModder: mhm, gotta get rid of fog&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: enemy hero prediction is what I'm talking about
 EvModder: Oh yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: early game farming is super important
 EvModder: They will still be in the fog, cracking Random won't help with that
 ItsNotABug: lol, my random bot that just goes after the nearest spider with all 3 beat wood 2, and went to 1st in wood 1 :D 
 EvModder: lol, yeah i think the boss difficulty is a bit off
 ItsNotABug: Meh, works for me :D 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wood is just to make sure you grasp basic game mechanics
 ItsNotABug: As long as I can't beat bronze with it, then i'll be concerned
 abt8601: Well, maybe gold league is where the real deal begins
 Jerrasterix: ItsNotABug, mine still does it.... just added wind and I am in silver :confused:
 EvModder: yeah lol
 abt8601: same for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my recommendation is to stay in top 600 when gold opens
 Aramang: using all 3 on the same target is actually pretty good for defence in early leagues, a lot of people will try to manage them individually and come up with something elss effective
 EvModder: my submitted code is ~1900, it just farms. only time it uses spells is if it can't kill spider in time, and it only does wind
 ItsNotABug: I'll see where this lands, then just add wind if enemy gets too close
 EvModder: &lt;200 lines c++
 abt8601: wow, that's short
 EvModder: yeah Patrick, the top 600 are way better than what i have
 ItsNotABug: So far i've added about 20 to the base python&#160;;) I've started a side project with classes, but just wanted to get out of wood/bronze before I complicate it
 EvModder: lines of code might not be a great measure for me, because my code is usually very dense lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of people are sending attacker early, so defenses change.  there's maybe 4 major strategies, they all rely on mana ... running out sucks
 EvModder: E.g., this is one line:template&lt;typename T&gt; constexpr double length(pair&lt;T,T&gt; xy){return sqrt(xy.x*xy.x + xy.y*xy.y);}
 ItsNotABug: Mine is literally just to track the closest threat and target it with everyone
 EvModder: ah ok, mine is the same except limits 1 hero per threat
 EvModder: so 2nd hero goes for 2nd closest threat
 EvModder: (unless it needs 2 heros to deal with a threat)
 ItsNotABug: Eventually I'll figure out a "threat level" and split my guys out to cover more ground, but this is going fairly high in bronze with no spells already :D 
 ItsNotABug: K.I.S.S
 Hackinfo: Hello, who can help me to understand something in codinGame
 EvModder: depends; we can try our best tho&#160;:)

 EvModder: not sure why that created a pastebin link, I guess the msg was too long
 EvModder: i was asking how to disable fog in the OPTIONS tab (in IDE)
 Jerrasterix: if it has too many new lines it does
 EvModder: i tried these 2: {enable_fog=false, fog=false}
 struct: you cant
 EvModder: ah
 EvModder: I want to test somthing without fog but I am too lazy to write a simulator so I think I'll just sign up with a new email lol
 MindBoggle: PatrickMcGinnisII , that replay looks like someone hardcoded for top left on part of their code.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ENABLE_FOG = false
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't know if it overwrites params
 EvModder: doesn't seem to work&#160;:(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: upper and lower case matters
 Wontonimo: nice replay PatrickMcGinnisII
 EvModder: I tried all upper and all lower
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no idea evM
 EvModder: I also tried with and without spaces around =
 Wontonimo: gn all :wave:
 EvModder: and upper/lower false
 EvModder: gn!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh it parses as integer
 EvModder: ahh
 EvModder: let me try0
 EvModder: still no luck
 EvModder: i remember using parameters on the spring2020 contest but i guess it changed or i forgot how
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I only hardcoded default locations depending on desired bot mode
 MindBoggle: I was looking at the opponent at the beginning but after watching the rest saw what you meant with them attacking
 SashaNukem: gn

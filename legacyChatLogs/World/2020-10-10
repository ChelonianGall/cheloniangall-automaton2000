 PatrickMcGinnisII: then write an output that you can cut/paste back into the ide
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: You mean just hardcoding the solutions?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i forgot what det. pikaptcha was about
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: =,=
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: For each passage, find the number of adjacent passages
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: THe way I'm doing it rn is calculating from every passage to each other passage, and counting the ones with a distance of 1.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like if i need the first 100 prime numbers in a quick lookup array, i would write code to generate the primes, output them in a format i can just cut/paste back into the IDE for the real program to use.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, lemme look... just a sec
 PatrickMcGinnisII: which episode?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a 100x100 grid w/ a max of 5 if's per cell should never timeout
 jrke: can anyone tell me an easy way to sort array in c++
 PatrickMcGinnisII: umm, sort(a,asize);&#160;?
 jrke: and if i want to sort from arr.score
 jrke: then is there any way
 jrke: or i have to use vectors then?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: patrickmcginnisII I'm looping (number of passages)^2 times :sweat_smile:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Are you saying I should just break after 100 iterations?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jrke you can define a function to use as a comparator or use vector

 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: .-.
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: beat me by a blink of an eye
 eulerscheZahl: was catching up with yesterday's chat first
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday to you too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :innocent:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I live in CA
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: So only 9:57 for me&#160;:)
 Majeck: Can someone explain to me what the winter throne is?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: A contest...
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;:)
 Majeck:&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its ...
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is tapping his foot</b></p><p><img src="/a/20062809897700" /> <b>**Majeck is patiently waiting for an aswer</b></p><p><img src="/a/50728347735682" /> jrke: its contest just started 30 sec ago
 Majeck: *answer
 Majeck: jrke really?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so it's COIF
 jrke: yes 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, i was rewriting T7D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: t&amp;D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: T&amp;D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i voted for coif tho
 Majeck: I wanted to do Fantastic Bits
 Majeck: So how do I play?
 Majeck: Do I just submit my COIF bot again?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's already there, but yeah w/ improvements
 Majeck: Oh
 Majeck: That's cool
 Majeck: I wanted to get the "get a bot into gold" achievement anyways
 jrke: if you have bot improve it
 Majeck: And getting to gold in COIF shouldn't be that hard since I'm already in silver
 Majeck: Awesome!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my T&amp;D was gonna get better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 Majeck: Jeez I wrote 980 lines for the original contest
 Majeck: A lot of refactoring is going to happen lol
 Majeck: Oh mannnnn
 Majeck: I remember that I wrote 3000 lines originally but didn't test it once
 Majeck: Stupid past me
 Majeck: Well, see y'all tomorrow it's 2 AM where I live :dizzy_face:
 Majeck: GL and have fun!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did anyone write an after-contest breakdown?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: forum doesn't seem so
 eulerscheZahl: for which contest?
 jacek: so <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/a-code-of-ice-and-fire">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/a-code-of-ice-and-fire</a> won
 eulerscheZahl: no i won. i wrote there long before you shared the link
 jacek: oh?
 jacek: i dont read chat
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote in the forum
 jacek: we have forum?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you didn't share the forum link

 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, cool...tx eulerscheZahl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh man, this was so long ago, i remeber the "cuts" discussions in chat
 eulerscheZahl: was fun
 eulerscheZahl: one of my favorite games here
 nickarshadi: love
 kovi: too bad you missed top3
 nickarshadi: love to everyone
 eulerscheZahl: i'm no longer suicidal about it :D
 kovi:&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's almost 1:30am my dinner is still on stove, glhf
 kovi: at least coif is not that random than some other
 eulerscheZahl: i'm curious what they plan for the next contest
 MadKnight: anyone playing contest&#160;?
 MadKnight: it's CoIF
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i play the contest
 MadKnight: nice
 eulerscheZahl: solved the 300 point coding, illedan and squid solved another one each
 MadKnight: oh can u send the link to the contest&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: now i try to get into that password protected 7z archive
 MadKnight: i lost the link

 MadKnight: &gt; R-Boy finds the time machine, which Zer0 used to travel to another era. Nearby, lies a copy of HG Wells’ The Time Machine. Could this book from the past help R-Boy travel in time? Unfortunately, R-Boy can’t read or understand it, because the space-time continuum has changed some of the words. Help R-Boy to start his time travels!
 MadKnight: wooow, such a clear description
 MadKnight: i have absolutely no idea what i'm supposed to do for this puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: coding300 is pretty clear
 MadKnight: a picture with a code&#160;?
 MadKnight: how to get code from these squares&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, running contestwon't tell you
 MadKnight: are those just bits&#160;?
 MadKnight: i think i'm not gonna participate, i don't have a team of people i know
 MadKnight: so u can tell me
 MadKnight: &gt;Freed by the guards, R-Boy looks for Zer0 who’s disappeared. He finds Zer0’s notebook and hopes to understand his plans, but his enemy’s writing is in a strange code R-Boy has to decrypt. and then they just give the decryptor - where do i find the message&#160;?
 Westicles: So it seems unicode has a bunch of gaps making it useless for encoding.  Looks like base65536 is the way to go?
 DomiKo: maybe
 DomiKo: For me base65536 was wosre than base256
 Westicles: hmmm
 Westicles: That is what you use?
 DomiKo: 40K chars ouput
 DomiKo: in base256 is 10K
 DomiKo: but in base65536 is 12K&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 DomiKo: some characters must count for 3!
 jrke: I like 2048 a lot,Thanks euler&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 dbdr: DomiKo: you hard code in 2048?
 DomiKo: yes
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to hardcode, the way to go probably is using some heuristic and only save the moves where you do something else
 eulerscheZahl: or try to zip it
 jrke: hardcoding in this optim i think is not a good idea
 DomiKo: I never try so hard to zip the output
 DomiKo: so I challanged myself to do my best
 eulerscheZahl: just solve it online as you are supposed to do
 dbdr: 10K * 30 = 300K
 dbdr: that's above the limit
 eulerscheZahl: and still too little to get to ille's score
 dbdr: yes
 jrke: did ille did beam search or made his own search?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know
 eulerscheZahl: i only know he doesn't have a constant search depth each turn
 eulerscheZahl: and at work they have 1 hour each friday where they can present their personal projects in the team
 eulerscheZahl: so he talked about 2048 :D
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: so they know
 dbdr: inb4 top 10 full of norsemen
 eulerscheZahl: time to stalk some Norwegians
 Westicles: Hacker euler needs to get that ppt

 Orpheo: hello&#160;! Does anyone know how the ranking of clash of code is done&#160;? I thought I won one but I'm 6th x) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/14143153f6bf818299e6cf7d2f32260ada00eff">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/14143153f6bf818299e6cf7d2f32260ada00eff</a>  
 eulerscheZahl: there are different modes. this one was about code size
 eulerscheZahl: you solved the fastest but with a long code
 Orpheo: ohh i didn't know
 Orpheo: but I guess in java I have 0 chnace in that case :D
 eulerscheZahl: you are free to use another language
 eulerscheZahl: 15min are enough to look up a few things
 Orpheo: yup that's true I just didn't know this type of problem did exist. 
 Orpheo: thanks!
 dbdr: good attitude!
 dbdr: oOo
 wlesavo: nice dbdr :slight_smile:
 dbdr: thanks!
 wlesavo: make Illes talk at work worthless :smiley:
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: are you still working on it wlesavo?
 wlesavo: dbdr also wanted to ask you, are you often reuse approaches that allowed you achieve top scores or is it often small improvements that makes it posiible?
 wlesavo: yeah, but not very successful, sim is working, but i feel like neither my eval nor search is god, 
 dbdr: in optim?
 wlesavo: yeah in optim specifically
 dbdr: in optim, I reused simulated annealing several times
 wlesavo: in 2048 SA worked worse than anythyng for me, i wonder if it is a bug or just a bad implementation
 kovi: uh, nice dbdr
 dbdr: thx kovi
 kovi: sa is still local optima
 dbdr: i'm not using sa in 2048
 Illedan: :scream:
 Illedan: nice dbdr
 dbdr: thx Illedan!
 dbdr: 55M now
 dbdr: 55.6
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Soon 1st then
 dbdr: well, probably you're close to optimal
 dbdr: I have a single case at 1.3M, probably losing points there
 Illedan: What score do you get on testcase 11205586?
 dbdr: 2.8M
 dbdr: you?
 Illedan: From 2.6-2.8 mill depending on it being able to solve the 16k tile at the end or not
 dbdr: my solver is deterministic
 Illedan: Nice
 kovi: wow
 Illedan: Not running some ms each round?
 dbdr: no
 DomiKo: deterministic :scream:
 Illedan: Set depth?
 dbdr: yes
 Illedan: Aha
 Illedan: With a little more speed I could do that too
 dbdr: everyone else is randomized?
 Illedan: What round do you get 5.8 mill on it?
 kovi: i use depth, but cant reach it consistently
 dbdr: none Illedan
 dbdr: misunderstanding?
 eulerscheZahl: didn't pay attention for a few minutes :shocked:
 dbdr: just #2
 Lauwie-Timmer: With ghost in the cell what should a valid action look like?
 dbdr: isn't it mentioned in the statement?
 wlesavo: so suddenly my aval was based on a single fcking tile
 wlesavo: eval
 Lauwie-Timmer: I found it nvm
 dbdr: what? :D
 Illedan: none? :P
 dbdr: yeah, that cannot work too well
 wlesavo: due to some bug summing of the score was just first tile x 16
 Illedan: I mean how many steps do you use
 Illedan: to get that max score
 Illedan: Wow, you are close
 Illedan: :scream:
 Illedan: :run:
 Illedan: :panic:
 dbdr: inb4 wlesavo #1
 dbdr: ah, you ment 2.8M, not 5.8M?
 dbdr: *meant
 Illedan: Yeah, how many frames P:
 Illedan: :P
 dbdr: 65488 actions
 wlesavo: oh, almost twice the score and now im hitting 600 due to poor search optimisation
 dbdr: isn't it just that you should send more actions per turn?
 dbdr: fear Illedan, fear...
 wlesavo: kind of, but now i can search less
 wlesavo: well at least it does hit 8r now
 wlesavo: 8k
 kovi: comps
 wlesavo: oh 8mil
 kovi: nvm
 Illedan: I pray for dbdr to have no more submits :D
 DomiKo: ohhh yes finally 32K online
 dbdr: Illedan, it's OK, you can relax now
 kovi: wow
 DomiKo: gg
 kovi: grat
 dbdr: thx!
 DaNinja: noice!
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Good
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: Ice and Fire are on fire right now
 DomiKo: I got promoted to bronze
 DomiKo: I guess a lot of submits in wood
 wlesavo: dam so it is kind of easy, and i was thinking im stupid
 wlesavo: simple mc gives 10mil
 dbdr: are you evaluating 2 tiles now?&#160;;)
 wlesavo: lol
 wlesavo: hitting 32k at least it does play better than i ever could :slight_smile:
 kovi: i was unable to reach 10mil with simple mc
 DomiKo: 16mln online
 DomiKo: ufff
 wlesavo: grats dbdr :slight_smile:
 dbdr: thx&#160;:)
 Nerchio: you need to have class Player as main right?
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: always fun when coding bosses with the SDKthe offline version expects the code to be a little different than the arena
 dbdr: why?
 MattSOrme:&#160;:
 wlesavo: hm almost 15 mil with a raw mc
 DomiKo: i just squared some contant and from 6mln to 12mln
 geppoz: which game are you talking about?
 leojean890: 2048;)
 Westicles: DomiKo, I ended up with 8 moves per character.  Did you get better than that?
 wlesavo: wow nice
 dbdr: exactly 8 Westicles?
 Westicles: yes
 dbdr: what about the holes?
 Westicles: holes?
 dbdr: not all 16 bit values are valid
 dbdr: (09:02:37 AM) Westicles: So it seems unicode has a bunch of gaps making it useless for encoding.
 Westicles: oh, I used <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536">https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536</a>
 dbdr: so that must take the holes into account, and encode slightly less than 16 bits per char
 DomiKo: i didn't even get 8 moves per character
 Westicles: I'm not sure what it does, but I doubt it is the best out there.
 DomiKo: are you sure that it's 8 per character?
 DomiKo: isn't CG counting some for more than one?
 Westicles: You stuff four moves into one ASCII character, then base65536 gives you another factor of 2
 dbdr: not exactly 2
 Westicles: 16424 moves to 4106 ASCII to 2053 gibberish
 dbdr: in that case. it's possible it's not hitting the special cases
 dbdr: the other possibility is, it's generating half the unicode characters, but not all are counted as 1 char by CG
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Unifont_Full_Map.png/800px-Unifont_Full_Map.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Unifont_Full_Map.png/800px-Unifont_Full_Map.png</a>
 Westicles: Right, half would make sense.  A full 32 bit solution would give you 16 moves per character, so there is room for improvement
 dbdr: but that's not how CG counts
 Westicles: oh, how does it count?
 dbdr: also most 32 bit values are not valid unicode code points
 dbdr: CG uses Java, and Java uses UTF-16
 Westicles: Is there some way to tell CG count?
 dbdr: send a text and see if CG rejects it as being over the limit&#160;:)
 Westicles: Dang, you guys are right.  It complains with &gt;64k of these
 Westicles: Somebody put in a bug report
 dbdr: it's not a bug it's a feature&#160;:)
 dbdr: gg wlesavo!
 wlesavo: thx, still just MC though :slight_smile:
 RoboStac: you can past into the ide in any of the code golfs - the character count displayed in that works the same way as the limit
 DomiKo: yap
 Westicles: good thinking.  my 2053 chinese characters counts up to 3202.  just terrible
 lala74: hello guys
 lala74: you guys know how to find all my solved challenges&#160;?
 dbdr: a lvl2 from japan #2 at Number Shifting :D
 Westicles: good, I hope he goes all the way. 
 wlesavo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: "Sorry for my English, I'm not dumb but French"found a funny README on github
 DomiKo: I guess Number Shifting is his second puzzle :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: after the onboarding
 eulerscheZahl: lvl2 doesn't mean you are a noob. just that you didn't play on CG much
 DomiKo: yes I know
 DomiKo: he just came here to crush us in NS
 Shadowtick: hi

 SharpShark: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3021f38f-4459-462a-8960-0d7fdc32569c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3021f38f-4459-462a-8960-0d7fdc32569c</a>
 SharpShark: Hmm, the pastebin doesn't work, does it...
 eulerscheZahl: it usually does. not today
 jacek: and yesterday and the day before..
 wlesavo: wow, bruteforce depth 6 gives 16.5kk
 eulerscheZahl: you still need some scoring to get there
 wlesavo: sure but  scoring is a simple part
 eulerscheZahl: double result = 0;
 wlesavo: (when one not scoring based on a single tile)
 eulerscheZahl: anything smarter?
 wlesavo: sum everything with discount in snake order
 eulerscheZahl: i do
 wlesavo: oh i see, it is the same
 wlesavo: but discount weight matters quite a bit for me
 eulerscheZahl: couldn't share more or it would be an expired pastebin
 eulerscheZahl: if i go wild on the discount, the lower numbers have no impact at all due to precision
 eulerscheZahl: i could use decimal
 eulerscheZahl: i use that so rarely that i always half forget it exists
 wlesavo: yeah, it should be somewhat balanced
 wlesavo: i feel like with depth 7-8 it could be even solved, but my implementation is to poor for that
 eulerscheZahl: 5 =&gt; 9 is a little betterbut 96% correct only, timeout
 wlesavo: with bruteforce?
 eulerscheZahl: beam depth 30
 wlesavo: oh i see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: beam decisions over one interation depth haven't worked for me,  so I been experimenting with 2 ply tree cuts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I gen. depth 5, gen 2 depths for all the nodes with score&gt;=maxscore/4, then over and over 2 ply at a time
 wlesavo: if i would skip more options in bruteforce i feel like i could go deeper, but im kindof lazy to implement it, but im really surprised that bruteforce and MC is almost equal with this scoring
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i do this til i gen. 20k boards total, can vary between 7 and 12 actually output moves per turn, and it still doesn't produce great results.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my current submit is only a depth 5 full gen., then once with 2-ply, outputting best score w/ a variation of euler's cell modifier
 wlesavo: i was stuck at 1.3kk trying different things, until i discovered my scoring is grid(0,0)*16
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, wow u jumped up to 17M
 wlesavo: that jump is basically fixed bug, and some tuning
 dbdr: wlesavo what is kk?
 wlesavo: 10^6
 jacek: and kkk?
 dbdr: why not M?
 wlesavo: old habbit i guess
 wlesavo: jacek :clap:
 wlesavo: experimenting in ide is painful
 darkhorse64: Trying to catch up on scoring. I am late on the party sorry. Scoring does not take into account game score but rather how tiles are arranged&#160;? This allows for (but not only) a limited depth when searching right&#160;?
 SharpShark: Can someone explain to me why "Unique Prefixes" puzzle, last test case the third correct prefix (out of five) is "verbo"? I just don't understand&#160;:-/
 wlesavo: darkhorse64 well i think thats what most people do, its kind of natural if you played the game by hand
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I spend a few hours *cough* on this game. But when you say it, it suddenly looks obvious
 darkhorse64: int64_t instead of double should cure precision problems
 eulerscheZahl: my scoring says this is good :thinking:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uws9yh">https://prnt.sc/uws9yh</a>
 wlesavo: hm, thats an idea to change scoring
 NevCG: ...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in a paper i read yesterday it said the best place to have the highest number was in the 2nd position
 PatrickMcGinnisII: of course that was for completely random play
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't try it ... yet
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://spartanideas.msu.edu/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/">https://spartanideas.msu.edu/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that article prefers the corner for the highest number
 eulerscheZahl: seems natural to me as well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, yup i read that one...wow, sorry brainfart
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess I meant to keep track of 2nd and 3rd place tiles, to see if it improved
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok i suck
 geppoz: I suppose that the fair game is when you don't know how next tile will spawn
 geppoz: so you have to evaluate BEFORE the spawn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i took score and modified it score=score&lt;&lt;16+ pos0tile&lt;&lt;8 + pos1tile&lt;&lt;4 + pos2tile&lt;&lt;2 + pos3tile .   And it improved 2.4%, but I haven't tried other ways to modify the eval
 geppoz: CG varsion is a bit "cheater"
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't know the next spawn, you can only print 1 action each time
 eulerscheZahl: with a limit of 600 user interactions the board isn't even halfway full at that point
 geppoz: y, I understand why CG is in that way
 eulerscheZahl: sure, it's a different game. but given the research done on the original i don't think that's bad
 jacek: 600 frame limit then why a code of ice and fire can have over 2000?
 eulerscheZahl: 600 user interactions, not frames
 geppoz: my program doesn't cheat (yet)
 jacek: oh
 geppoz: next step is to eval with spawn&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i could split the single moves into different frames too (had that at first)
 eulerscheZahl: but it makes the replay loading more laggy
 wlesavo: one possibility would be eulerscheZahl to display only last frames of a turn, but i guess that would ruin many things
 geppoz: I didn't meant that it is not nice! :D
 eulerscheZahl: that would force some rewrite to make it happen
 geppoz: just saying that is different from the ones in the article
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wlesavo I think he did, I think he added '-' as a modifier to supress frames
 eulerscheZahl: but that - completely disables the viewer
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, i don't think anyone needs it til u get to maybe 10M, lol
 wlesavo: yeah euler, at least animation of mooves would be gone that way, and probably quite a few other things
 eulerscheZahl: sure it's possible to only show the final state
 eulerscheZahl: but right now the - completely blocks sending any data to the viewer
 eulerscheZahl: i would have to send againcompute the new state but don't update until the end
 eulerscheZahl: some refactoring involved
 eulerscheZahl: and it's in javascript :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: but feel free to fork and send me a pull request&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: or figure out why loading the replay takes so much time with viewer and speed it up
 eulerscheZahl: that would benefit the whole website
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Last 8 messages from euler
 eulerscheZahl: 3.5s to load my test match that isn't even that huge
 eulerscheZahl: you broke my wall!
 eulerscheZahl: hm, each time i call addState, it loops over all the states of taht entity within the frame to see if it's at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: linear time for a list. i have a lot of states each frame

 jacek: only you can put fun in the funeral
 jacek: AutomatonNN is it fun?
 AutomatonNN: when it was in the browser contest to the next contest
 Shadowtick: hello
 Majeck: Hello
 Majeck: Is there any way for variables to be uppercase from the stub generator input?
 Majeck: Oh never mind
 Majeck: It was just in python that the stub showed it in lowercase lol
 riiiandeadsea: What does this error mean? ERROR: ld.so: object 'libstdbuf.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
 MSmits: it CG side bug
 MSmits: dont worry about it
 cakeman38: hello
 Majeck: hi
 Majeck: Hi
 Majeck: I just finished the Network Cabling puzzle and I was wondering if someone could explain to me why the solution works
 LastRick: I can try
 Majeck: I mean I solved it because I saw "Median" in the tags so I thought of using that as the main_cable_y but although it works I don't understand WHY it works
 Majeck: Thanks LastRick
 Majeck: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/network-cabling">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/network-cabling</a>
 LastRick: Did you ever draw the layout of the puzzle, say on paper? 
 Majeck: Yep
 Majeck: And I realized that the median was always the one with the lowest cable length
 LastRick: yep
 Majeck: But I don't understand why hahaha
 LastRick: is there a pattern to the rest of the Y-locations?
 Majeck: If you mean the house positions I think they're all random
 Majeck: Ohhhhh do you mean a pattern in the length of the cable when you alter main_cable_y?
 LastRick: Yeah, without giving away too much here in public, basically there is a relationship between pairs of Ys that becomes apparent if you sort the y distances (relative to the median)
 SharpShark: Anyone did <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/unique-prefixes">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/unique-prefixes</a>&#160;? I just don't understand how the last testcase is correct - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/iVnFhB5V">https://pastebin.com/iVnFhB5V</a>
 magaiti: looks correct to me
 SharpShark: I read this "* Each given word must have a distinctive prefix from the prefixes of the other given words." as "all the output prefixes must be different"
 magaiti: well
 magaiti: anything written about duplicate words?
 SharpShark: Sure, I just think those two sentences kinda contradict each other ("* A prefix cannot be used by two different words.")
 magaiti: well i guess you have to assume duplicate words count as one for "each given" part
 SharpShark: And the next point is so weirdly written that it kinda leaves room for interpretation.
 SharpShark: I think I understand it now, but only after looking at the test cases. Which is weird, I believe the description should be all that is needed.
 magaiti: "That should look familiar for those who handled switches for their command-line scripts or maintained their completion tables."
 LastRick: Yeah I completely ignored that line in the description
 magaiti: with this in mind, it seems logical to assume duplicate works should have the same prefix
 magaiti: words*
 LastRick: I solved it the same way SharpShark did, by focusing on the solutions. 
 SharpShark: If you have to assume (especially based on something that doesn't even look like related to the actual description of the problem) then I think the description is just wrong.
 magaiti: whatever, that's how real problems are formulated any way
 magaiti: real world problems
 LastRick: Agree to disagree. It could have been written better.
 magaiti: yeah it could have
 magaiti: but it's your job to find out 
 LastRick: Find out what?
 magaiti: everything you have to know in order to solve the problem
 LastRick: Disagree. That's the submitter obligation (unless it's a reverse).
 Majeck: SharpShark
 Majeck: Nevermind
 Majeck: My computer lagged
 magaiti: well you see. in real world you dont have submitters. you have customers. they will do their best to describe their problem, but you can't expect a perfect description
 Majeck: But on the topic of descriptions vs solutions I have a pretty strong answer
 Majeck: I agree with magaiti for the most part
 Majeck: In a perfect world the description would be all that is needed but we most definitely don't live in a perfect world
 Majeck: For example every time I work on a school related test almost half of the work is deciphering what I'm being asked for
 Majeck: Typos, the professor getting confused, black and white images, etc
 SharpShark: I take this site as "from devs to public (devs)" and not "from public to devs". If devs won't show the public how it's done, it's never gonna improve and devs gonna keep complaining about incomplete inputs etc.
 Majeck: For codingame I think this applies even more, usually unless it's one of the "main" puzzles, I mainly focus on the test cases instead of the description, for more than once have I found errors in it
 SharpShark: Plus this site is for fun (to my best knowledge), you would get paid for deciphering the inputs in the real world.
 LastRick: I'm with Sharp. I'm a developer, I am gonna to define the problem as perfectly as possible (not like a customer) and I expect submission to be held this high of standard.
 Majeck: SharpShark getting payed for something MOST DEFINITELY DOES NOT follow what you're being paid to do being of quality
 Majeck: Ahh weird grammar
 chinaredclif: someone is good in c 
 chinaredclif: can help in my problem 
 magaiti: part of this site is meant to find employment
 magaiti: sponsored contests, that "jobs" button i never touched
 Majeck: hahaha
 Majeck: Once I passed level 15 I got scared af by the pop-up telling me I could work at Google
 Majeck: Or employees if you press the notification at the top that everyone's brain has filtered
 LastRick: hahah
 Majeck: (I didn't realize it was there till I looked for it lol)
 chinaredclif: who can tell me what is the method 
 Majeck: Anyways I think that in a perfect world the statement/description should be all that is necessary to solve a puzzle
 Majeck: And I see no problem in anyone refusing a puzzle because the statement isn't clear enough
 Majeck: However we can't control the past
 chinaredclif: I want to store in memory my variable during my tons of input 
 Majeck: And in the past a lot of puzzles have been passed with incomplete/confusing statements 
 magaiti: if your goal is recreatoin, do what you want, no argument here
 Majeck: And though it sounds harsh you usually win nothing by complaining about how things should be
 Majeck: Like what I do is if it really bothers me I go and fix it
 Majeck: Or bother a codingame mod till he fixes it for me lol
 SharpShark: I would fix it, I just don't think my level is high enough.
 Majeck: Man
 Majeck: I miss discussions 
 LastRick: Yeah, I think you have to be Level 29 to touch the puzzles. It's pretty high
 Majeck: Like my monkey brain tells me that we've all been in a round table talking but in reality I'm just as lonely as ever lol
 LastRick: To put that in perspective, I've solved every Easy, half the mediums and some of the remaining hard. Only level 24. I can't even look up a validator.
 Majeck: LastRick yep, you can edit clashes after playing 300+ though
 Majeck: Have you solved any very hard puzzles?
 LastRick: Majeck, you're right, it's been a great discussion. I really enjoy this site.
 LastRick: Nope, haven't gotten to those yet
 Majeck: Woah LastRick you only joined in August
 Majeck: And you've already finished all those puzzles?
 Majeck: Are you sure you're not a robot programmed by Euler or MSmits?
 SharpShark: By the way, one more note - I played with the Mars Rover 2 (medium) yesterday and I think the second test case has inputs in the wrong order Y_Y
 SharpShark: (or whatever is that landing thing called)
 magaiti: landing thing is called mars lander, duh
 Majeck: Pretty sure Mars Lander - Episode 2 is A-Okay
 SharpShark: I think I was getting negative inputs for X and Y and such
 Majeck: I think you got the negative inputs for velocity
 Majeck: "hSpeed and vSpeed are the horizontal and vertical speed of Mars Lander (in m/s). These can be negative depending on the direction of Mars Lander."
 SharpShark: Yeah, that is correct. I was getting it for X and Y though&#160;:)
 Majeck: Maybe you forgot to read an input and it de-phased?
 Majeck: It's happened to me before
 SharpShark: I passed case 1 and I needed to shuffle the order of inputs to start getting reasonable values in case 2
 Majeck: Ohhhhhh
 Majeck: That's a big nono
 Majeck: Don't mess with the predetermined input stub
 Majeck: lol
 SharpShark: Exactly
 SharpShark: That's why I'm saying it looks broken&#160;:)
 Majeck: You can press the refresh on the top right to get the stub back
 magaiti: you lose everything else tho
 Majeck: Copy your code -&gt; hit refresh -&gt; paste your code
 Majeck: And then delete the input handling of your old code
 SharpShark: I mean if you finished that one you can just go there and hit "Play all testcases" again to see whether it's all gonna pass or not, right? If I'm wrong then all is gonna pass. If I'm right then your old code "won't work" anymore because of the inputs.
 Majeck: They all passed
 Majeck: However I did use the optimization puzzle cause I refactored it not too long ago
 Majeck: And I have printerrs saying the position and stuff
 Majeck: I'll test in on the original puzzle
 SharpShark: Maybe someone fixed it already since yesterday&#160;:) Gonna take a look again, maybe tomorrow.
 Majeck: They also work on the original puzzle
 Majeck: I think the odds are higher that you messed up rather than the code did
 Majeck: Not trying to be mean
 SharpShark: Definitely, as I said, gonna take a look again later.
 Majeck: It's just that from experience the amount of times I've blamed the code/computer/system for something vs it actually being me is pretty close to 100% hahaha
 Majeck: The only time I was genuinely wtfed by the compiler was once that an int was passed by reference in C#
 Majeck: It was the one and only bug I've faced by a compiler, but then I closed it and opened it again and it worked as intended
 SharpShark: OK, last question (since I just tried it and it still seems weird on my end) - can it be that it's broken only for some languages? Meaning are the test cases written separately for each language (usually in that given language)? Or are they written only once (in bash or whatever)?
 magaiti: input stub is written in a pseudocode
 magaiti: sometimes it gets translated wierdly
 magaiti: which language you are using?
 SharpShark: Java
 magaiti: hmm, its rather popular language
 magaiti: there should not be problems with input stubs there
 tibu: Hello, i got some trouble with promise in js
 tibu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://repl.it/@TinBo/InconsequentialGainsboroPercent">https://repl.it/@TinBo/InconsequentialGainsboroPercent</a>
 magaiti: try rewriting your code, like reading a whole line, and then parsing it
 tibu: Can someone help me how to return correctly count variable 
 tibu: I sent a link with the code, you can have look
 Majeck: SharpShark I'd recommend just copying your code, hitting refresh and then pasting it and deleting the input handling
 Majeck: I think you missed a sout or a in.nextInt()
 SharpShark: If I have this as my game loop <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/q14cpddA">https://pastebin.com/q14cpddA</a> the first test case returns correct debug output, second returns incorrect debug output (Y below 0).
 Majeck: tibu you can copy/paste code and it will automagically generate a pastebin link
 SharpShark: The second test case also says the "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction..." which I have no idea how can happen if the first case passed without the warning.
 tibu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/s2XChVw4">https://pastebin.com/s2XChVw4</a>
 tibu: i got confused why this function not return count correctly
 SharpShark: (One correction, the Y isn't below 0, it's always 0 in the example I provided, which is wrong as well.)
 Majeck: SharpShark
 Majeck: My theory was correct
 Majeck: "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction..."
 Majeck: Means you printed a sout before reading all or didn't print a sout at all
 Majeck: I'll check your code
 SharpShark: I know what it means, but how come case 1 doesn't print that?&#160;:)
 SharpShark: Please, check the code, it's fairly simple as it doesn't do anything :D
 magaiti: input: 7 numbers, output: 2 numbers
 magaiti: some languages need extra effort to handle newlines
 Majeck: magaiti's totally right
 Majeck: Once in Java I remembered I did like 10 lines just to handle those screwy newlines from user input
 SharpShark: Still doesn't answer why case 1 works and case 2 doesn't with the same code.
 magaiti: because in case 1 the input alignment is corrent, and for case 2 is not
 Majeck: Ok SharpShark I tested it
 Majeck: I know what you did wrong lol
 SharpShark: What do you mean by input alignment? Example?
 magaiti: example you are given 7 numbers per turn, and you read 6 or 8
 Majeck: There's a secret console to where codingame writes
 Majeck: And if you read 6 inputs and codingame writes 7 you'll get out of sync
 Majeck: In any case SharpShark rotate and power are supposed to be read last
 Majeck: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/855f130f-6bd6-41ee-b78b-2022bb3763c6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/855f130f-6bd6-41ee-b78b-2022bb3763c6</a>
 Majeck: That should work
 SharpShark: Sorry boys, I think I found it&#160;:) (And it was outside the game loop, so it wasn't in the excerpt I sent.) Premature optimization gone wrong&#160;:) (I didn't read the whole landscape since I already found a landing site, so I breaked out.) My bad!
 magaiti: yeah i was thinking about that
 magaiti: dont optimize input
 Majeck: but but
 Majeck: What I said is also valid
 Majeck: Your excerpt was reading rotate and power instead of X and Y
 SharpShark: It is, but wasn't the root cause of the issue (I was playing with the order because I was getting weird numbers, so I knew that I played with that, but the actual issue that lead to me playing with the input order was before the excerpt).
 SharpShark: And that's why I thought the cases might be wrong - because the inputs "were fine" for case 1, but not for case 2.
 magaiti: just because something passes doesnt mean its correct
 magaiti: garbage in - gabage out
 SharpShark: You are correct, harder to validate though in this specific environment&#160;:)
 SharpShark: I'll know better next time though&#160;:)

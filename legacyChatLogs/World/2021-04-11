 Wontonimo: for slcc, a basic bot that just goes straight to the next checkpoint with no other logic at all should place around 90th
 Smelty: hmm...I'm doing that....but my ranking is 112 o.o
 MACKEYTH: slcc?
 Wontonimo: are you allowing your bot to turn 180 degrees, or constraining. it to 18% like in CSB?
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge</a>
 Wontonimo: yeah slcc
 Smelty: oh i didn't know it could turn 180
 Wontonimo: that'll make a difference :D
 Smelty: but i didn't add that constraint in the first place so
 Smelty: my ranking just stabilized to 116
 MACKEYTH: Hm, only open to Europeans? I don't see USA in the country list
 Smelty: oh yea I didn't see USA so I just put united kingdom :sweat_smile:
 Wontonimo: it just means you can't get the prizes
 Smelty: ohh okay
 C2H5OH: secret contest? yeah, you got a good rank bocause  nobody participate.
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539508901">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539508901</a>
 Wontonimo: kinda the opposite C2H5OH, it is mostly just fairly hardcore participants
 Smelty: my rank is 108/122  :flushed:
 ZarthaxX: where?
 Wontonimo: slcc
 C2H5OH: oh, its CSB. I don't like CSB.&#160;:(
 Smelty: its a CSB but modified
 Smelty: you can turn 180, there are 3 racers, 1 pod each
 ZarthaxX: oh okey
 ZarthaxX: nice profile pic C2H5OH
 ZarthaxX: suits your flag hehe
 eulerscheZahl: but I would expect alcohol to fit the nickname
 ZarthaxX: dont know what it is :P
 eulerscheZahl: Ethanol
 ZarthaxX: googled it?
 ZarthaxX: plz say yes
 eulerscheZahl: no, i attended school
 ZarthaxX: that's what i DIDNT want to hear
 ZarthaxX: ah my culture level hits one again
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure Astrobytes would know that too
 ZarthaxX: well some ppl (like me) dont&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and you say that's because of your school system?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't know that there are such differences
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. we had an exchange student from Hungary once
 eulerscheZahl: he was able to answer questions despite the lesson being in German
 eulerscheZahl: chemistry teacher was already mad at us for not knowing the answer. and then this guy raised his hand and gave the correct answer
 eulerscheZahl: he didn't learn that at our school :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: no it's not my school fault, i just forgot everything i was taught
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 ZarthaxX: lol that infiltrated :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: AmnesiaxX
 ZarthaxX: dude was cheating
 ZarthaxX: even understanding german, that doesnt sound easy
 ZarthaxX: yeah, intended amnesia
 Lachrymosa: My school's level of chem peaked with balancing combustion reactions and calculating the joules it takes to melt ice in a cup.  And frankly a lot of people didn't do well with just that.
 eulerscheZahl: we were equally impressed and ashamed :D
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: melting ice was physics for me
 eulerscheZahl: we spent 20min watching the ice melt and starting to boil
 Lachrymosa: friction coefficients broke some people, they dropped the class the next day lol
 ZarthaxX: physics and chemistry were hard for me
 Lachrymosa: to be fair it was a "pilot" class of higher physics. The intention was people were supposed to already know calculus but since it isn't offered until our final year anyway, how could they have it already
 eulerscheZahl: in anorganic chemistry we got up to redox reactions
 ZarthaxX: i feel like they should be some uni thing lol
 ZarthaxX: inorganic?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe :D
 ZarthaxX: redox is so annoying, memorizing stuff
 ZarthaxX: i have heard that inorganic is painful
 Lachrymosa: I'm lost :3  I always wished I'd learned how to interpret those neat O-chem diagrams with the hexagons and stuff
 eulerscheZahl: oh and atomic models of course. Bohr, Orbital
 eulerscheZahl: the hexagon is just 6 C atoms
 Lachrymosa: yea, but what does a single vs a double line mean?  The number of bonds?
 Andriamanitra: this site needs more clash of code reviewers capable of critical thinking
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: to both of you
 Lachrymosa: Huh, maybe those aren't as hard to read as I thought.
 eulerscheZahl: my reviews sometimes turn into slaugther
 Lachrymosa: A lot of the clash of code issues I run into are vague statements because of language differences or a difference in assumption of experience with math
 ZarthaxX: Andriamanitra TOTALLY AGREE, there are many clashes whose statements make no sense at all
 ZarthaxX: or even the reverse mode ones..
 eulerscheZahl: at the very least it should be proper English
 Lachrymosa: I solved a reverse mode one and then when I submitted it i got 25% XD
 Andriamanitra: i only looked at few submissions and two of them were completely unacceptable but still 2/3 approved and 0/3 rejected
 ZarthaxX: i dont get how they got approved
 eulerscheZahl: quest map
 ZarthaxX: luckily i abandoned that place
 ZarthaxX: but quest map makes you approve once
 ZarthaxX: right? D:
 eulerscheZahl: and then create your own once
 Lachrymosa: I think I've reviewed a few. Haven't ever tried to make one myself
 Wontonimo: should be a quest challenge to downvote / reject 
 eulerscheZahl: you only got the point once the clash gets approved for real
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they are like "where is my achievement? I'll do some more"
 Lachrymosa: A lot of things I could think to have people do would be too trivial and likely already done.
 ZarthaxX: i knwo you have to create one, and that's prob the problem here.. lol but how do they get approved, so many ppl out there compelting a quest map?
 ZarthaxX: oh didnt know that quest map dela
 ZarthaxX: y
 ZarthaxX: well that may be a problem :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/</a>
 Wontonimo: i finished mine ... i had a lot of fun doing the quest map ... it was weirdly fun
 eulerscheZahl: timeline of new contributions added
 eulerscheZahl: (approved only)
 Andriamanitra: it seems people glance at the problem and approve it with message "it looks good" without even testing it
 ZarthaxX: you got all the apps toad
 ZarthaxX: sheez a lot
 eulerscheZahl: now guess when the quest map was added
 ZarthaxX: at the peak?
 ZarthaxX: close to that time?
 Wontonimo: 2020-07 ish
 eulerscheZahl: at the rise in july
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 ZarthaxX: we are doooomed
 ZarthaxX: lots of new comm puzzles too
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: sadly I don't have access to the voting
 eulerscheZahl: *rating
 ZarthaxX: what rating?
 eulerscheZahl: clashers can vote if they liked it
 eulerscheZahl: low rating =&gt; clash gets removed
 Wontonimo: once i got access to approve/reject i spend 2 months curating the contribs ... then I just lost interest.  
 Wontonimo: too many people pushing crap for the quest
 eulerscheZahl: and I did some cleanup to remove those that later got deleted. number reduced by maybe 2 dozen
 ZarthaxX: sad Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: very
 Andriamanitra: yeah reviewing clashes properly really does feel like a losing battle
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl ah okey
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle moderation is a lot of effort when you want to do it properly. I also stopped doing this
 eulerscheZahl: (also because CG released some moderation guidelines which I disagree with)
 Andriamanitra: you spend an hour looking at a puzzle and providing good feedback only to have 3 other people come in and validate a broken clash anyway
 eulerscheZahl: so true
 Wontonimo: i mostly focused on the puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: even one of my own contributions (spaze maze) was approved without review
 Wontonimo: probably they thought _you_ don't need actual review
 Wontonimo: (oh good, it wasn't me)
 ZarthaxX: space maze looks like a complicated one to test tho
 ZarthaxX: and i agree with Wontonimo :P
 ZarthaxX: toad just does everything right
 ZarthaxX: freezed 3d dice? let that get approved anyway, its the toad
 eulerscheZahl: that's exactly why Space Maze was pending for 3 months
 ZarthaxX: complexity?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, hard to solve
 eulerscheZahl: you have a problem with the dice game?
 ZarthaxX: i guess it makes sense
 DaNinja: yes hard to solve within the time limit
 ZarthaxX: i mean, there arent many very hard problems either
 eulerscheZahl: one even did it in Python
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl sarcasm? :P
 eulerscheZahl: ah good
 ZarthaxX: wow
 eulerscheZahl: thought the 3D library would case some problems for you
 ZarthaxX: nah i love your work lol
 ZarthaxX: i wanna try 3d too now
 ZarthaxX: not on cg tho
 eulerscheZahl: did you notice the broken dice layout?
 ZarthaxX: em no
 ZarthaxX: i still dont know what that game was about either
 eulerscheZahl: 3 and 4 should be opposing each other (sum of 7)
 ZarthaxX: didnt get the movement
 eulerscheZahl: but they are neighbors
 ZarthaxX: oh..
 ZarthaxX: why is that?
 ZarthaxX: thought you designed it
 ZarthaxX: or you stole the design?
 eulerscheZahl: that's what you get when you download free assets
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: well, my gf is doing a 3d modelling course rn
 ZarthaxX: so i told her i could use her 3d stuff to dosmth
 eulerscheZahl: and Blender is really challenging for me
 ZarthaxX: she asked me for 10 pieces to design
 ZarthaxX: so now she is doing 3d chess pieces lol
 ZarthaxX: blender is nto for us haha
 ZarthaxX: she is not using blender tho, cinema 4d
 eulerscheZahl: every tutorial: type HGFUDSAIHFIU done
 ZarthaxX: i can tell her to make a dice for you
 eulerscheZahl: I need an FBX to import in the end
 ZarthaxX: for pixi?
 eulerscheZahl: threejs
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 ZarthaxX: i will ask her
 eulerscheZahl: current vertex count is about 8000 for 1 die. which is already on the high end
 ZarthaxX: well, if you continue with the project, but you kind of left it right? 
 eulerscheZahl: gets laggy with more
 ZarthaxX: ah..
 ZarthaxX: gotta make it with few polygons too
 ZarthaxX: aight
 eulerscheZahl: i'm mostly done with the game
 ZarthaxX: looks mostly geometric, except for those borders
 ZarthaxX: and holes
 ZarthaxX: ah good
 Wontonimo: try out some webgl
 eulerscheZahl: needs some testing if the complexity is appropriate for a multiplayer game
 ZarthaxX: sounds good
 ZarthaxX: i will remember to ask her then
 eulerscheZahl: but I'll only replace the dice if I like the new ones
 eulerscheZahl: the current one looks pretty lit
 eulerscheZahl: except for the numbers thing
 ZarthaxX: are you challenging my gf capabilities good sir?
 ZarthaxX: yeah looks super cool
 ZarthaxX: i had exactly that dice
 eulerscheZahl: you downloaded the same asset?
 eulerscheZahl: but I edited it (merged vertices to reduce model size)
 ZarthaxX: nono i meant in reality lol
 ZarthaxX: same colors
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 ZarthaxX: oh and you still ahve vertex count limit? damn
 eulerscheZahl: 8k is on the upper end of loading fast enough
 eulerscheZahl: corners are already a bit pixelated
 ZarthaxX: okey i see
 ZarthaxX: do you want the same model but with less vertexes?
 eulerscheZahl: less or equal depending on how it looks
 eulerscheZahl: and sides swapped of course
 eulerscheZahl: but I won't pay&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: she is learning
 eulerscheZahl: all I'm willing to do is giving credits in the statement
 ZarthaxX: i wasnt gonna ask for money lmao
 ZarthaxX: that's fine :P
 eulerscheZahl: I paid Zerp with a rare CG tshrit
 eulerscheZahl: but i can't promise something that I don't have myself (contest is near but top20 isn't trivial)
 ZarthaxX: she doesnt want a tshirt take it easy lol
 Westicles: dice design by ZarthaxX's ex-gf
 ZarthaxX: ex?
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 eulerscheZahl: future ex
 ZarthaxX: ah okey
 ZarthaxX: that's more probable
 ZarthaxX: thanks guys, so positive
 ZarthaxX: forgot you paid zerp with a tshirt
 ZarthaxX: that guy never came back&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: hey, future could mean heat death of the universe 
 ZarthaxX: liked his art
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo that sounds awesome!
 eulerscheZahl: he did the art first without expecting anything in return
 eulerscheZahl: gave him the tshirt afterwards
 ZarthaxX: so humble
 ZarthaxX: both of u
 eulerscheZahl: hungry*
 eulerscheZahl: see you
 ZarthaxX: bb :rofl:

 blakestone: hello, i have a number solving problem
 blakestone: is this the best place to ask for assistance?
 eulerscheZahl: just ask
 blakestone: I am trying to write a solver which turns 4 objects at different steps.
 eulerscheZahl: i think I need more context to understand what you are talking about
 AntiSquid: reread your own sentence blakestone, how much information does the reader have&#160;?
 blakestone: example. I need to make all objects point NORTH and their starting point is: [E S S N] and they each have different steps such ash [1 3 1 2]

 AntiSquid: i am extremely confused and will walk away from this question in 3 seconds
 blakestone: no worries - thanks anyways
 jacek: return [t[i-1], t[i], t[i+1]]&#160;?
 jacek: such a helpful mod, isnt he
 blakestone: It is a challenging problem to describe sorry
 blakestone: It is a common challenge featured in many games and looking for a way to solve this via code.
 DaNinja: a step is a rotation clockwise?
 blakestone: yes they rotate clockwise
 DaNinja: sounds like an interesting puzzle, you should create a contribution <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a>
 geppoz: blakestone do you mean that rotating an element, will also rotate his neighbours&#160;?
 Swetsen: hi!
 EdwinZ: o/
 Coder_prabhat: print("hello")
 Swetsen: Println("hello in java")
 Swetsen: forgot the semicolon...
 jrke: print("hello") is ok for python
 Coder_prabhat: luckily python don't know semicolon
 Swetsen: ik im not rlly into java tbh
 jrke: it knows&#160;; is used for separating commands if you are writing it in one line like
 jrke: print("hi")print("hello")is equal toprint("hi");print("hello")
 Coder_prabhat: oh yeah i m sry 
 Coder_prabhat: it knows:joy:
 blakestone: This may explain it better
 blakestone: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/JnnRDPf">https://ibb.co/JnnRDPf</a>
 blakestone: I am trying to write a solver which solves that challenge.
 eulerscheZahl: you find the index of a given color (red)
 eulerscheZahl: then you rotate by exactly that index
 eulerscheZahl: or if you can rotate in both directions: min(index, length-index)
 blakestone: index meaning position?rotating one also affects it's neighbouring objects

 <b>**EdwinZ slaps his brother around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/58491929211531" /> AntiSquid: reminds me of simon game blakestone
 eulerscheZahl: of course rotation affects all colors. but when you solve one, you solve all of them
 eulerscheZahl: so it's completely reasonable to just concentrate on solving one and ignoring the others
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, index == position
 AntiSquid: biden continues border wall construction, i feel like i either didn't sleep enough or probably didn't wake up today
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a source for this? i just found <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/11/trumps-border-wall-belongs-biden-now/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/04/11/trumps-border-wall-belongs-biden-now/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: which says he still wants to invest a lot in the border (shocking enough) but not the wall itself
 geppoz: blakestone so a solution will be B+B+A+A+A&#160;?
 AntiSquid: wants to plug the gaps

 Louis.: you are lvl 50 i think you have many experience about programming
 Louis.: yeah LDami
 Louis.: yes
 LDami: Ok&#160;:)
 Louis.: you have to remove extra spaces LDami
 LDami: even in conditions, for loop etc ..&#160;?
 LDami: "for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)" should be "for (int i=0;i&lt;N;i++)"&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: every char count

 LDami: Thanks ahah
 struct: but if you want to win shortest you cant use c++ imo
 LDami: I don't know C++ ahah
 LDami: and your solution does not work struct
 struct: it doesnt?
 struct: why not?
 LDami: no time to check why, but I had a index array exception
 struct: ah I see why
 struct: because the i inside the loop will start at 1
 struct: because you incremented it
 LDami: oh, so it's ++i&lt;N&#160;?
 struct: for(int i=0;N--;i++)
 struct: no
 LDami: oh
 LDami: bruh, python developpers have 5 time less chars than me lol

 ZarthaxX: that was some days ago, ty&#160;:*
 eulerscheZahl: finally legend color
 ZarthaxX: finally
 eulerscheZahl: did you solve puzzles or wait for upvotes?
 ZarthaxX: now i need top 100 for the legend color
 ZarthaxX: coc quest map
 ZarthaxX: worst answer possible
 ZarthaxX: :D
 eulerscheZahl: indeed :D
 ZarthaxX: got to top 1k and bla
 BlaiseEbuth: :nauseated_face:
 ZarthaxX: also 500 cocs
 ZarthaxX: that got me legend
 ZarthaxX: worst way to achieve it i guess
 eulerscheZahl: *click* *click* *click* done
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: coc is fun tho
 eulerscheZahl: you risk a kick
 BlaiseEbuth: I disinherit you.
 ZarthaxX: not always..
 ZarthaxX: wow the 2 mods agree
 ZarthaxX: i will shut up&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: coc sucks guys
 eulerscheZahl: my grandma always told me she would disinherit me if i'd ever start smoking
 ZarthaxX: and you did
 eulerscheZahl: at that point i had no idea what inheritance means
 Marchete: do you smoke?
 eulerscheZahl: hell no. i hate smoking
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: a smoker vegan could be weird
 jacek: vaping vegan perhaps
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too spontaneous to plan my suicide 20 years in advance
 jacek: i can plan it for you
 eulerscheZahl: thank you, that's dedication
 eulerscheZahl: i either want train or bridge if that's possible
 BlaiseEbuth: So you're from the ones who want to piss off others even at death time&#160;? ... Like it
 ZarthaxX: are you wishing for a train or bridge death?
 ZarthaxX: lol BlaiseEbuth :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: train one is annoying too
 ZarthaxX: jumping off a cliff is better&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: or stop breathing for too long
 KiwiTae: o/
 eulerscheZahl: you will loose consciousness and start breathing again
 jacek: been there done that?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 struct: Seems normal
 ZarthaxX: KiwiTae heyo 
 struct: Was trying to eval boosts without discounting them

 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ShannonNorris97: Uh-oh, my CGX Formatter passed all the test cases, but fails two of the validators. Not sure how I'm going to go about fixing those haha
 LDami: For bots game, the rank depend of the league right&#160;? It's not a global rank&#160;?
 struct: you have league rank and global rank
 KiwiTae: ShannonNorris97 what your code gives back if u input '()'
 LDami: Is it, I get the answer by myself :3
 struct: You can check global rank on your profile or the multi global leaderboard
 LDami: Oh yeah, global rank is disapointing, but league rank is ok :D
 ShannonNorris97: kiwitae it gives back the brackets on separate lines
 KiwiTae: which test u failing?
 eulerscheZahl: are you an alt account of MK?
 eulerscheZahl: or when did you start writing "u" instead of "you"?
 jacek: ask him what he feels about csb
 ShannonNorris97: I pass all the normal test cases, but then fail validators 4 and 6: Simple string of characters which must not be modified, and Simple key/value with spaces
 KiwiTae: eulerscheZahl :joy:
 ZarthaxX: lol
 struct: MSmits you are not rank 1 anymore on Yavalath

 KiwiTae: ShannonNorris97 u keep string delimiters?
 struct: He had enough of me :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: that "u" thing is triggering me more than it should
 ZarthaxX: i teached him :relaxed:
 KiwiTae: loool didn't want to upset you 
 ZarthaxX: good boi kiwo keep doin that
 BlaiseEbuth: u should relax ez
 ShannonNorris97: KiwiTae Yeah I'm using regular expressions to separate quotes and non-quotes, then removing all spacing from non-quoted parts

 Wontonimo: yes, VergilX ... just ask your question
 VergilX: Thank you. I'm new here, so I just asked if I could ask. Thanks LDami and Wontonimo&#160;:'D
 EdwinZ: is twitch down :unamused: i can't watch stream

 LDami: good morning&#160;! (afternoon for me :3)
 EdwinZ: does doing bot programming is neccecary to become mentor&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: might be enough to do clash+optim+golf
 EdwinZ: ok&#160;:)
 jacek: do you want a mentor that has only done clash though
 EdwinZ: :D
 EdwinZ: nop
 BlaiseEbuth: Mentor of what&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: CG level
 EdwinZ: yup
 eulerscheZahl: you are grand master BlaiseEbuth
 jacek: the bar is really low
 EdwinZ:&#160;:\
 EdwinZ: top 5000 that is my target&#160;: p
 BlaiseEbuth: I know euler. But I don't remember the lower lvls
 Smelty: (go struct)
 struct:&#160;?
 Smelty: good luck in ccsl
 Smelty: *slcc

 eulerscheZahl: and good luck with css
 kovi: what is slcc?
 eulerscheZahl: semi-private contest
 eulerscheZahl: CSB with 1 pod

 Smelty: and up to 3 players
 eulerscheZahl: ends this evening
 eulerscheZahl: PS5 for the winner
 Smelty: i cant get it though because i'm american
 kovi: hiders gonna get this?
 eulerscheZahl: i can't get it because i'm alergic to CSB
 AntiSquid: some D players on there
 BlaiseEbuth: No. You can't get it 'cause your not daporan
 eulerscheZahl: we'll see soon, ends in a few hours
 Smelty: yep
 kovi: no time lately anyway, have to spare for spring challenge
 AntiSquid: what else are you doing
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure if i want to try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/aisports">https://www.gocoder.one/aisports</a>
 kovi: udacity selfdriving
 Smelty: 5k plus? hmm
 eulerscheZahl: while they are after each other (tiny intersection) i'm not sure if I want to do both
 Smelty: idk
 AntiSquid: the nano-degree&#160;? or just regular tutorial&#160;?
 LDami: When I print " | ", the spaces are not printed :thinking: did you ever had this issue&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Smelty: just print " " + "|" + " " as an alternative?
 kovi: nano
 Smelty: with 1 space an each of 1 and 3
 eulerscheZahl: nano us much easier to start with than vim
 LDami: does not work @smelty&#160;:/ something must be broken in my code
 AntiSquid: got to finish it in one month
 kovi: you did whole course in 1 month?
 Smelty: LDami yea probably
 Smelty: also for Coder One you can participate as a team...hmm
 BlaiseEbuth: Yé!
 BlaiseEbuth: I'll team up with me
 Smelty: sMort
 AntiSquid: i didn't pay for any of the courses, but it says it costs 300 / month, would only do it if i had time and it's definitely possible, but don't want to pay @_@
 Smelty: o.o
 struct: Ok 6 hours left
 Smelty: 6 hours 8 minutes
 Smelty: yep
 LDami: I understood my error, I was using WriteLine instead of Write .. so my string was truncated
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that makes no sense. WriteLine prints spaces too
 LDami: Yep, but the second line was sent before receiving the new datas
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Smelty: I'm using java, the System.out.println prints everything
 Smelty: ohh okay

 Smelty: oh xD
 Smelty: also fort he slcc do the longer maps have less laps
 Smelty: *for the
 eulerscheZahl: will this be another contest where struct puts a lot of effort into it and then forgets to hit "submit"?
 ZarthaxX: prob
 ZarthaxX: at least he threw optims yesterday
 Smelty: uh oh
 AntiSquid: makes hexagon CSB game
 eulerscheZahl: if he deletes the account and creates a new one, he'll has to ask Thibaud to regain mod status
 Smelty: oh..
 struct: I have something ready
 struct: Im just not sure if its good
 Smelty: :0
 BlaiseEbuth: So don't submit
 struct: I did not put a lot of effort into it
 AntiSquid: add more hex
 Smelty: i just did a if/else thingy
 AntiSquid: i am sure it's beautiful, what is it struct?
 Smelty: ^^
 struct: might not be the best
 struct: But I enjoy watching it play
 Smelty: can u submit and i can test my bot against it
 Smelty: :D
 struct: soon
 struct: I tested and I beated you
 Smelty: good
 EdwinZ: :p
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/0NEv0vA.png">https://i.imgur.com/0NEv0vA.png</a>
 Smelty: well at least your bot beat the "basic" ai
 struct: yes
 Smelty: I'm sure you'll be okay
 struct: you use all the boosts instantly smelty?
 Smelty: yEp
 Smelty: i just stopped updating my code
 Smelty: i know I should save it for the best ones but...meh
 AntiSquid: come on smelty
 AntiSquid: you can go higher
 Smelty: lol
 AntiSquid: i wrote a 5 minute bot in D
 Smelty: wow
 AntiSquid: ah maybe it's java that's holding you back
 AntiSquid: unleash the D
 Smelty: hmt
 Smelty: at what distance can you effectively use a boost
 struct: Im not sure
 struct: Its based on your current speed also
 Smelty: I'll put 5000 and add a backup
 AntiSquid: struct what rank do you get if you submit?
 struct: I dont know
 struct: I didnt bench
 struct: I only played vs default AI and self
 AntiSquid: can you beat the other D guy&#160;?
 struct: I dont think so
 struct: There are maps I dont boost at all
 struct: So might be a reason
 AntiSquid: new plan then, no delete, but if you don't beat bon crayon you need to switch to D 
 Smelty: that
 Smelty: 's weird
 AntiSquid: better than delete
 Smelty: my rank went up 10 after i decided to stop wasting boosts o.O
 AntiSquid: ofc, boosts are important
 struct: What should my var name be for checkpointcount * laps?
 Smelty: my longest distance calculator is going cray cray
 Smelty: checkAmount
 Smelty: or checkTotal
 LDami: allCheckpoints&#160;?
 AntiSquid: fullJourney
 struct: thanks

 eulerscheZahl: and why did you stop boosting Wontonimo?
 Smelty: hmm weird
 Wontonimo: what do you mean eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you boosted 3 times in the beginning
 eulerscheZahl: and then you didn't
 jacek: he used up all the boosts
 Smelty: ithink the checkpoints were too far
 Smelty: so my ai thoguht it was bad
 Smelty: *thoughgt
 eulerscheZahl: oh, BOOST is still a limited resource?
 Smelty: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't try the contest :D
 Wontonimo: ah
 Smelty: the var boosts shows u how man ther are
 jacek: eulerscheZahl you dont do contests? so youre not 5%?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm doing interesting contests
 eulerscheZahl: such as topcoder recently
 eulerscheZahl: tourist played that too. but not on CG. so mine was tourist approved
 Wontonimo: Smelty , here is a replay of your bot vs a friend of mine LazyMammal <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539662398">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539662398</a>
 Wontonimo: looks like you have a very similar AI
 Smelty: hmmmm
 Wontonimo: if you add a cooldown to your boosts, you'll prevent burning through them 
 Wontonimo: or limit your boosts to 1 per checkpoint maybe
 Smelty: true
 Smelty: i got to go play in a soccer match soon tho
 Smelty: i might implement it when i get back
 wlesavo: euler whats next for you besides CG and codejam?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/aisports">https://www.gocoder.one/aisports</a>not 100% sure yet
 struct: How hard is it to setup docker?
 eulerscheZahl: starter bots in python+typescriptif you are familiar with docker, you can user whatever you want
 eulerscheZahl: haven't tried yet
 Smelty: Alright got to go play in a soccer match, see ya
 eulerscheZahl: ran some code in docker years ago for a university project
 eulerscheZahl: grading system for homework, pretty similar to CG testcases
 eulerscheZahl: you play soccer now?
 eulerscheZahl: i couldn't play since early november&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: damn virus
 EdwinZ: :worried:
 struct: I dont play since february last year
 eulerscheZahl: i have a right to get injured
 struct:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and for ZarthaxX the situation is even worse
 struct: I didnt play soccer though, I played 3vs3 and futsal
 eulerscheZahl: and astro with his back pain
 Astrobytes: yep
 eulerscheZahl: 3 vs 3 is fun too, you get to play the ball more often
 Wontonimo: i haven't played soccer since i was 14
 EdwinZ: :joy:
 Astrobytes: 5 or 7-a-side was fun back in the days when I played a bit
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea how old you are now to put that in relation Wontonimo
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:?
 eulerscheZahl: :door:
 jacek: how do you play it 3v3
 struct: small goals
 struct: no goalkeeper
 struct: Ok there is a "goalkeeper"
 struct: But you need to be in a certain distance from the goal
 jacek: on paper?
 EdwinZ: :joy:
 struct: At least with the rules/field I used to play with
 Wontonimo: this was my first contest but considering it "doesn't count", does that leave me a contest faux virgin?  so confusing
 eulerscheZahl: did you get the achievement?
 Wontonimo: "Start a contest +10"?  nope
 eulerscheZahl: case closed
 Wontonimo: i like your methods of deduction
 Wontonimo: SLCC has gotten me interested in revisiting search race.
 f0ru0l0rd: This is my first time using this. I really don't understand something, and it isn't quite intuitive... I'm using JS. What is the string?

 f0ru0l0rd: what value is the input in this, and how can I access it?
 f0ru0l0rd: const n = parseInt(readline());for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
 struct: readline()
 struct: line should be the string
 struct: n  should equal to the number of lines
 f0ru0l0rd: and yet console log line says screw me
 struct: console.error()
 struct: to debug
 f0ru0l0rd: ok
 f0ru0l0rd: but how do I just run it without testing it
 f0ru0l0rd: because if I console.log(line) then nothing

 f0ru0l0rd: I'm just hoping I guess for a standard console
 f0ru0l0rd: and I'm not getting a standard console
 dawici: line stops existing after the for loops ends; you need to access it inside the for loop because it has different values each time the loop iterates

 f0ru0l0rd: Maybe somethings wrong with my system, I've had several issues with firewalls, but I don't even get that in the console output

 f0ru0l0rd: this is my first time trying this site, and =(  I'm feeling pretty miserable about the experience =(
 KiwiTae: lol no worry gets better
 f0ru0l0rd: Here's to hoping.
 KiwiTae: u sure you selected JS in the ide?
 f0ru0l0rd: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: What console are you talking about? Not the browser one, just to be sure.
 KiwiTae: or if nothing working maybe press reset code
 f0ru0l0rd: no not the browser one
 f0ru0l0rd: reset code... I didn't think of that
 f0ru0l0rd: I may try that. see if it jostles turning something on.
 KiwiTae: eulerscheZahl sorry i typed u again :kissing:
 f0ru0l0rd: Like I said, I couldn't even get to the coding competetion the first time.
 f0ru0l0rd: It would count down, then do nothing but sit there and look at me stupid.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a known bug. Not on your side
 f0ru0l0rd: So... I'm thinking a connection is not playing nice.
 f0ru0l0rd: =(
 f0ru0l0rd: Is the console disappearing a known bug?
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope
 f0ru0l0rd: *not showing anything
 BlaiseEbuth: Just the launching issue in coc

 BlaiseEbuth: A valid link! :scream:
 struct: I should track enemy boosts right?
 BlaiseEbuth: You gonna code this in 3 hours&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ZanthraxX
 struct: ofc BlaiseEbuth
 struct: maybe in 30 minutes
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop hidding
 struct: My bot is bad dont worry
 BlaiseEbuth: So push it
 ItayBeladev: I need to be bronze at one more thing in the AI category, but I don't want to do something that takes a lot time to read or something that has a lot of inputs, what can I do?
 jacek: coders strike back
 jacek: but then youll need to reach bronze in 2 games
 ItayBeladev: Yea I am already bronze at it
 struct: STC
 struct: Smash the code
 struct: Hypersonic
 struct: Maybe hypersonic takes a bit
 struct: STC is faster
 ItayBeladev: And I forgot to mention, I dont want something with complex algorithm like pathfinding, minimax and these things
 BlaiseEbuth: lel
 struct: on stc you need an if
 ItayBeladev: thats it
 ItayBeladev: lol
 Wontonimo: hey ItayBeladev, it'll be quite difficult to do well in almost any bot competition without a simulator.  CSB the only one i know where you can get to silver fairly consistently with just if/than/else and math
 Wontonimo: you may be able to do <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=silver">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe/leaderboard?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=silver</a> 
 Wontonimo: and the simulator for it is straight forward enough
 Wontonimo: ItayBeladev what programming language do you prefer?
 gilufin: פייתון לא?
 Wontonimo: english please
 ItayBeladev: Python
 jacek: mhm
 Anonmousehhf: I mostly prefer Python, yet for my own (not) good, I sometimes challange myself to use Pascal
 jacek: mhm
 VizGhar: try resource management games ItayBeladev - Code Royale maybe?
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah ItayBeladev, Code Royal may be an easier challenge than what I suggested
 jacek:  you really suggested uttt :thinking:
 Smelty: I'm back
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Astrobytes: iirc you can get bronze in UTTT by doing very, very little
 Smelty: :grin:
 Smelty: my team beat the other team 6:1
 Astrobytes: Code Royale involves reading 192456 inputs first
 Smelty: wow
 jacek: Astrobytes lies. it would timeout the referee
 Astrobytes: I may have exaggerated a little.
 Astrobytes: There are many inputs.
 struct: botg easiest one
 struct:  /s
 Smelty: hi struct
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: lol

 Smelty: hmm
 Scarfield: 17th Wontonimo :muscle:
 Smelty: nice
 Scarfield: got your GA working, or another appraoch?
 Smelty: hm-?
 Wontonimo: thanks Scarfield&#160;!
 Smelty: :0
 Astrobytes: he was 6th earlier Scarflate
 Smelty: 16th now!
 Smelty: o
 Astrobytes: That's one fierce lb though :D
 Scarfield: oh damn, nice improvement since yesterday!
 Scarfield: ille on 20th though? 
 Smelty: oof
 Astrobytes: just submitted
 Scarfield: oh yea
 Smelty: nice
 Astrobytes: Have to admit I've enjoyed this
 Scarfield: yea its a nice twist on csb, not sorry i was part of dragging you in :p
 Smelty: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539698983">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539698983</a> 
 Smelty: nice 
 Astrobytes: No I'm grateful to you and Wontonimo for dragging me into it :D
 Wontonimo: the main changes in my bot since yesterday are:- assume other bots don't boost- include boosts in my evaluation function to be roughly equal to 1000 pixels distance
 Smelty: ooh nice
 Wontonimo: those two things are basically the difference between yesterdays ~26th and todays
 Astrobytes: yeah I never bothered tracking opponent boosts either tbh
 struct: I just did a hacky version
 Smelty: hrmm\
 struct: Maybe we need a csb like game but with fuel
 Smelty: thats a good idea
 Scarfield: hmm, i do assume my opponents can use their remaining boosts (if any)
 VizGhar: I'd like to see tower defense optim
 jacek: tower dereference?
 VizGhar: yup, but maybe more on steroids and single player
 Smelty: w-
 Smelty: hmmm
 struct: 2 hours to write eval
 struct:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: go struct go&#160;!
 Astrobytes: intriguing idea struct (and VizGhar, also hi VizGhar, didn't see you for a bit!)
 Scarfield: any idea how the placements are gonna work, when the contest ends? resubmit of top bots
 Smelty: wow <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539699822">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539699822</a>
 Astrobytes: You got this struct!
 Smelty: ^^
 Scarfield: my eval is super simple tbh
 Wontonimo:&#160;:) Smelty
 Smelty:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: that game was decided very early :D
 Smelty: yep
 Scarfield:&#160;:'(
 Scarfield: you mean it was rigged im sure
 Wontonimo: My eval is "1000*boosts_remaining - distance_to_win"
 Wontonimo: or 1e100 if win
 Smelty: rematch: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539700577">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539700577</a>
 jacek: seems big. how floats comparison goes then?
 struct: you dont keep track of passed checkpoints Wontonimo?
 struct: eval* them
 Astrobytes: nice use of boosts by my bot there
 Wontonimo: struct i pre-calculate the distance between checkpoints, and add them all up.  Taht's the total distance
 VizGhar: yeah Astrobytes. haven't been here for a while. new job and a lot of work
 Scarfield: seems submits are still very slow(?)
 VizGhar: 60hr work week + 3 kids... kinda difficult
 Astrobytes: Oh, congrats on the new job then VizGhar&#160;:)
 Smelty: ^
 Astrobytes: Heh, yeah for sure!
 VizGhar: thank you
 Scarfield: 60hr sounds rough
 Smelty: yea
 Wontonimo: i did something like "checkpoints_cleared * 50000 - distance_to_next_checkpoint" , but what happens is it puts too much value on preventing the opponent from reaching the next checkpoint instead of racing to the next one
 Wontonimo: i found that my bot would be ahead, then just as the opponent is about to reach at checkpoint, my bot would turn around! and try to stop them
 VizGhar: Scarfield you bet... I've started teaching on one high schools without proper materials, so preparation is tough
 VizGhar: it'll get easier in year or two
 Astrobytes: Nice solution to that particular problem Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: Did you reuse your CSB code initially?
 Wontonimo: thanks Astrobytes.  Also, congrats VizGhar&#160;!
 Wontonimo: yes, i totally stole my CSB code
 Smelty: o . o
 Astrobytes: Me too, though I ripped a lot out
 Wontonimo: i don't think i would have entered this competition if i hadn't already done CSB
 Astrobytes: I think I did the pod 'football/soccer' one before I did CSB properly
 Astrobytes: Another semi-private
 VizGhar: thanks Wontonimo&#160;:) So what's new here except of escape rooms?
 Wontonimo: how long have you been gone?  Back in July they introduced the quest map
 Astrobytes: He's been here since :D
 Astrobytes: Not sure there's much you've missed to be honest, probably a few new community multis
 VizGhar: I've gone missing since new year
 BlaiseEbuth: What a hangover...
 VizGhar: :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jacek: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: struct, watch your time man, submits are over an hour
 AntiSquid: is that challenge still going on?

 Astrobytes: ah
 AntiSquid: until french midnight&#160;?
 struct: ye
 AntiSquid: oui *
 Westicles: We've been discussing on the council of elders to end it early
 Westicles: To discourage hiding
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: more like punishing it
 AntiSquid: look at the flags, just ille hanging in there
 Astrobytes: pb4 is looking real good 
 Zenoscave: Still no dapo?
 Astrobytes: not until the end
 Zenoscave: So an hour XD
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: top ~25% with ruby. not bad
 Westicles: he won't beat pb4
 Wontonimo: nice Zenoscave&#160;!
 Zenoscave: probably could have tweaked a bit more args but meh, not fun at that point
 Astrobytes: it's hung in there quite steady Zeno
 Zenoscave: Thanks Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew'ing and standing it's ground&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: PEWPEWPEW
 BlaiseEbuth: pew pew!
 Astrobytes: Westicles: It's going to be interesting I think&#160;:)
 Westicles: weird

 Wontonimo: i like it
 Wontonimo: the one in second has decided t ochange strategy and instead focus on trying to timeout the opponent
 Astrobytes: Jeff got angle issues
 AntiSquid: pb's doesn't look like pure NN
 Wontonimo: no, handing back to block the leader from clearing the next checkpoint
 AntiSquid: might be rule based, completely
 struct: pb4 bot bullying others&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: smashing it
 Astrobytes: oh I see it, still, it's not working&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: *hanging , not handing
 Astrobytes: think we all got it&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: any more tricks up your sleeve Wontonimo?
 Astrobytes: I kinda wish I'd started this at the contest start lol
 Wontonimo: i'm trying stuff :D
 Astrobytes: Welcome to my Sunday :D
 Wontonimo: without a local test env, it's all shooting in the dark
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if I'd started earlier and/or been more enthusiastic I would have made the effort.Not overly bothered, just happy for some kind of contest tbh
 AntiSquid: coulda shoulda woulda
 BlaiseEbuth: hey hey hey
 Westicles: Fat Albert?
 AntiSquid: time to do another bloody test at home bs
 Wontonimo: that was a weird show
 Astrobytes: damnnn Fat Albert, totally forgot about that
 Astrobytes: Was there ever an episode where Albert gets some 'lude action? :P (sorry)
 Wontonimo: i just remember that sound bite and the one guy wearing a hat with eyeholes
 Astrobytes: Peculiar indeed.
 AntiSquid: negative
 Astrobytes: oh, you did a LF test
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpMAd7uXMSY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpMAd7uXMSY</a>
 AntiSquid: wrong video, wanted to share one where he just says "you know the thing"
 Astrobytes: I pulled a huge bogey out on one of my care home visits. Was half-embarrassed and half-amused.They don't half make your eyes water those things.
 AntiSquid: crazy how much crap can be stuck in your nose
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I always try to clean it beforehand but it's a ... fairly deep-digging swab
 AntiSquid: one time i had to blow out a somewhat big piece of bread out of my nose, laughing while eating, coughed, a bit went up somehow into the nostril ... 
 Smelty: o.O
 AntiSquid: crazy
 AntiSquid: they recommended i don't push too deep at home, just blow nose beforehand, it's a highly sensitive area
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: lol to the bread bit or to the pushing too deep (pulling out bits of brain)&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Both :D
 Zenoscave: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Zenoscave: Ille werking my submit
 AntiSquid: oh no, tell him to stop
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Ille stop
 BlaiseEbuth:  (_°□°)_ pew pew pew  ┻━┻
 Zenoscave: pew pew pew
 Astrobytes: wepwepwep
 Wontonimo: got any new upgrades Zenoscave&#160;?
 Zenoscave: The right velocity coefficient
 AntiSquid: do they have recalc for the private ones?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Zenoscave: apparently it's -3 not -2
 Astrobytes: nah AntiSquid
 Wontonimo: I've been plugging away at a few different ideas, but I'm just going to stick with what I got
 Astrobytes: It's a solid bot Wontonimo
 Westicles: dapo on the board
 BlaiseEbuth: My bot does not crash anymore. But it does not like copmetition, it flee out of the map...
 Zenoscave: here we go!
 AntiSquid: woah
 Astrobytes: eyyy about time
 Smelty: woo
 AntiSquid: how did you guys even guess he'd submit?
 Zenoscave: Because it's dapo
 AntiSquid: is everyone stalking him&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Prizes, etc etc. It's a Dapo contest
 Wontonimo: that bot goes for the insta-kills
 Smelty: zenoscave i think we have similar ai..

 Astrobytes: He's motivated. Unlike standard CG contests.
 Wontonimo: i was giving that strategy a lot of thought, but didn't go for it
 AntiSquid: PS5 :thinking:
 Smelty: hmmst
 struct: I told you he needed a controller
 Astrobytes: stop chatting and submit struct
 Smelty: lolol
 Smelty: yea you should struct
 Zenoscave: struct lol
 struct: my bot is bad
 Smelty: still...don't get last...
 AntiSquid: struct needs to beat the top D bot or switch to coding in D
 Smelty: dang
 Zenoscave: OR at least top ruby
 struct: I can just use a wrapper
 Smelty: hmm neumann dropped to 14th
 Astrobytes: Daporan has a great bot, looks like pb4 is gonna be troublesome as Westicles mentioned earlier
 Smelty: *nvm*
 Astrobytes: Smelty: resubmitting
 Smelty: yes
 Zenoscave: nice win gloopy
 Astrobytes: Oh interesting
 Smelty: I think it would be interesting if they did teams instead of 2 of your own pod
 Zenoscave: Try code-a-la-mode smelty
 AntiSquid: think he means 2v2
 Smelty: yea
 Zenoscave: Ah gotcha
 Wontonimo: fireworks then
 Astrobytes: The CSB soccer one was like that no?
 AntiSquid: you can create your own contribution Smelty and add communication between bots
 Smelty: oOoo
 Astrobytes: Ah no, I think it was 2 of your own vs 2 of the opponent
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539725847">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539725847</a>
 struct: A bit risky from him
 Smelty: ah
 Smelty: interesting
 Zenoscave: That's hilarious struct. 
 Smelty: bumps go BRR
 Zenoscave: Think I can get an angle calc done in time?
 struct: which angle calc?
 Zenoscave: Just realized I boost way off course sometimes
 Zenoscave: Angle of movement delta to next target
 Wontonimo: do you suppress boost when really close to a checkpoint&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: Yeah
 struct: omfg
 struct: how am i going to track this bug
 struct: with 13 minutes left
 struct: lol
 Zenoscave: boost &gt;= 4000
 Smelty: i did &gt;5000
 Astrobytes: yay for submit though struct
 Smelty: woo
 struct: in my loses
 struct: my bot doesnt move at all
 struct: wtf
 Smelty: 43 tho..NICE
 Zenoscave: whoops p1 v p2?
 Zenoscave: input reading?
 struct: it happened on 1vs1
 Smelty: i just did a 1v1 with u it was fine
 KiwiTae: saw it on 3players too
 KiwiTae: doesnt happen in ide?
 Smelty: i tested against him, it was fie
 Smelty: *fine
 KiwiTae: its nice u play with handicap &gt;&lt;
 struct: it was random i dont know
 struct: I think i fixed
 Smelty: yay
 struct: I was starting the timer before reading inputs
 Smelty: maybe thats why
 Smelty: ur red pod was acting kinda weird... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539728156">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/539728156</a>
 Smelty: it hesitated between 3 and 4
 struct: still I think top 40 at best
 struct: I failed eval
 AntiSquid: this will help <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dlang.org/blog/category/tutorials/">https://dlang.org/blog/category/tutorials/</a>
 Smelty:&#160;;)
 Smelty: o.O one of them has your name in it
 Smelty: well....under 2 minutes...gg?
 Astrobytes: It's gonna be an exciting finale
 Illedan: gg
 Zenoscave: gg :laughing:
 BlaiseEbuth: Happy new year!
 Astrobytes: was actually fun
 Theino: Did I miss a contest?
 struct: my place either gets first or last
 struct: there is no inbetween
 struct: my bot*+
 Zenoscave: My submit was at last second
 Astrobytes: Theino: semi-private
 Zenoscave: sorry not sorry
 struct: dapo resubmited too
 Astrobytes: Ow, this should be interesting then
 Zenoscave: dammit
 Zenoscave: At least i got the angleright
 Zenoscave: angle code*
 Smelty: welp i got 59 
 Astrobytes: I only have one question Zeno: Ruby???!!!
 struct: What algos did you use?
 Zenoscave: acos
 Zenoscave: Ruby is my favorite lang. 'cept py3 but everyone expects py3
 Astrobytes: acos faster than atan2 in rb?
 Zenoscave: no I just couldn't remember the +/- for diff of vectors with atan2
 Astrobytes: Eh, well, can't argue with language choices.Ah lol :D
 struct: my submit doesnt seem that bad tbh
 struct: thought it would be worse
 Zenoscave: GG struct
 struct: gg
 struct: This is what I did to choose angles
 struct: Might not be good but ill share it anyways
 struct: array &lt; vector&lt;float&gt;, 360&gt; angles;
 Zenoscave: The angle was a bad idea. I'm falling bad
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e1b9e60-d8f6-4c66-a1d4-9729264a8568">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e1b9e60-d8f6-4c66-a1d4-9729264a8568</a>

 Zenoscave: Nice job struct!
 Astrobytes: Oh that's your angle pruning?
 struct: yeah something like that
 Astrobytes: Nice, like it.
 struct: Also I sometimes chose to only pass N
 struct: It gets angle to current checkpoint and the next one
 struct: +15, -15 from each one
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 Astrobytes: You did some thinking on this
 struct: I had stuff to do yesterday
 Zenoscave: I think I should have gone with 36deg not 18deg on the cutoff for boost
 struct: but is w/e I would not fight for the top anyways
 Zenoscave: my losses are generally from remaining boosts
 struct: I still think I might have a bug
 struct: my bot never placed 2nd
 struct: in a 3 man battle
 struct: either that or my bot is bad lol
 therealbeef: interestingly, my bot got faster when i reintroduced constraints on the angle, not 18 like in CSB but  about 26
 Zenoscave: huh. Good to know realbeef
 therealbeef: somehow it could maintain its speed better with more drifting
 ZarthaxX: dapo appeared lol
 AntiSquid: woah struct made it, congratz
 Wontonimo: nice bot struct&#160;!  Glad to see you made the deadline.  i'll be lurking to see our bots compete
 ZarthaxX: struct :OOOO
 ZarthaxX: niceeeee
 Zenoscave: No more last second changes, I've learned my lesson
 Zenoscave: Looks like that change cost 10-15 ranks
 Astrobytes: Until the next last-second change/submit that is Zeno :D
 Zenoscave: you read my mind&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: I should change my name to ockham
 Zenoscave: With these split-second razor thin decisions
 Wontonimo: i've worked on too many production systems and learnt that lesson the hard way.  last minute is not a good idea unless you don't have any other alternative
 struct: thanks guys
 struct: I was afk for a bit
 Wontonimo: hey struct, what search did you end up using?
 Zenoscave: It depends on the stakes. I work for a fortune 500. I don't do these kinds of things at work. But here... meg
 struct: I used smitsimax
 Wontonimo: cool!
 struct: I think I failed eval though
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: exactly the right attitude. Nothing to lose :D
 Wontonimo: and how did you constrain the moves?
 struct: Its mediocre at best
 struct: One sec
 Astrobytes: that's a hardcore top 3
 Scarfield: yea big gap
 Zenoscave: and it'll get a little bigger. dapo is only 30% complete 
 Astrobytes: and check the winrates between the 3

 struct: Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: pb4 had confidence in his last submit
 Scarfield: oh yea its from yesterday
 struct: I only did depth 5
 struct: I had no time to try more stuff
 Zenoscave: will you have time for spring struct?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: no still today Scarfield
 ZarthaxX: beast structo
 ZarthaxX: &lt;3
 Zenoscave: Looking forward to it&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Hi Zarthie
 Astrobytes: as in Sunday
 ZarthaxX: pewpew
 ZarthaxX: hey zeno
 Zenoscave: pewpew
 struct: I learned this contest that pruning &gt; performance
 Zenoscave: Oh man, struct will be a top competitor now, I bet
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: Pruning improves performance&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: if you weren't already
 ZarthaxX: fooor sure
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Zenoscave: yup dropped 12 ranks with that angle crap
 Scarfield: oh time zone xD
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: eh struct, still beat you twice :D
 struct: damn, good job
 Astrobytes: 3 times!
 Scarfield: xD
 Zenoscave: Not bad for a 50 line ruby code
 struct: neuman 1st
 Astrobytes: Its not really helping me ofc but eh
 Zenoscave: oh man! that's been a while since a neuman win yeah?
 Zenoscave: AAAAND Pb4 first
 Astrobytes: Switching between Neumann and pb4 struct, very close
 darkhorse64: Zenoscave: -3v + boost&#160;?
 struct: he was never first, unless it was in a private contest
 Zenoscave: -3 + boost and target switching
 struct: hi darkhorse64, what search did you use?
 Scarfield: should have called dips if pb 4 won
 Zenoscave: dibs!!!!!
 Zenoscave: I call it
 Scarfield: xD
 darkhorse64: I have found that 2.5 was better. My bot is an AG which ignores the other pods + boosts after reaching a checkpoint
 Scarfield: poor him, potentially have to give away a ps5
 Wontonimo: struct thanks!  I like that search space&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Yeah I played with 2.5 but I'd not change course soon enough with that. Target switching wasn't the best out there
 Westicles: Why, does he work for Sofia or something?
 Scarfield: AG? you mean GA darkhorse?
 Astrobytes: algorithme génétique Scarflackingfrenchskills
 darkhorse64: Yep, french acronym
 Zenoscave: Even the American knew that&#160;;) Sarf
 Scarfield: oh, nice
 Zenoscave: And we don't know much
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 darkhorse64: Basically, it's SR code + boosts + tailored physics
 Zenoscave: Yeah that was mine as well darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: I failed to find a good eval
 Astrobytes: You did good staying up there darkhorse64 good job mate
 Zenoscave: no collisions?
 Scarfield: well my knowleadge og french is basicly baguette
 Astrobytes: I'm inspired to go back to SR, BR and CSB again
 struct: Ill try to finish csb
 Zenoscave: struct you haven't finished CSB?
 struct: nope
 struct: I finished sim
 Astrobytes: Long story zeno&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: You don't need sim
 darkhorse64: It tried but it performed worse. Likely bad pod prediction
 Scarfield: same tbh, found some really bad bugs in my csb that should help a lot if fixed. its amazing in even works 
 Astrobytes: Your bot has been pretty solid throughout Scarfield, good job man
 Scarfield: ty&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I did not think I would enjoy doing this contest, I stand corrected
 Zenoscave: It was fun indeed, needed the community for sure
 Astrobytes: Definitely
 Astrobytes: I hope the Sofia Amadeus guys had fun too
 darkhorse64: It's fun to compete with others
 Astrobytes: 5% kinda fun though :P
 Zenoscave: 5%?
 struct: My code for next contest starts now
 struct: Ill write templates now
 darkhorse64: All the hard work with CSB and SR has payed a lot
 Astrobytes: Come on Zeno, I sent you the discord link with the conversation previously!
 Zenoscave: struct we don't even know the gametype. di we?
 Zenoscave: Astro i'm a slow reader&#160;;)
 struct: Im expecting a non physics game
 Scarfield: i dont know what the 5% refers to either&#160;:'(
 Zenoscave: Tile or board based?
 Astrobytes: Quick maths, slow read :D
 struct: yes
 struct: Astro stop winning vs me
 Zenoscave: You should destroy then struct with your crazy bfs stuff
 struct: damn it
 Scarfield: he is in a cave, not enough light to read
 Zenoscave: hopefully on a 15x15 grid
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: that was the percentage of users that enjoyed the competitive aspect of CG
 Zenoscave: I can see the shadows though
 Astrobytes: According to some CG poll
 Scarfield: :O
 Scarfield: thats incredible low
 Astrobytes: Well, I guess a lot of competitive people put 'fun', because competition is fun. Loaded questions imo.
 darkhorse64: top 3 fully random now
 Astrobytes: Yeah, all really, really strong
 Scarfield: without 0.09 points :o
 Scarfield: within * xD
 Wontonimo: this was fun ppl, it was mostly you and this chat channel that made it so interesting&#160;!  really looking forward tto the next one
 Zenoscave: cheers to that :beer:
 Astrobytes: Oh competition time is always lively Wontonimo
 struct: dapo first
 struct: o.o
 Zenoscave: You should see the chat during a public competition
 Astrobytes: Yeah :beers:
 Wontonimo: later!
 Scarfield: and well done on 11th Wontonimo!
 struct: later
 Zenoscave: gg ttfn
 Astrobytes: later Wontonimo, gg man
 Wontonimo: :beer:
 Astrobytes: Illedan still creeping up on jft
 struct: Did anyone else did what dapo is doing on 1vs1?
 Astrobytes: What's he doing 1v1?
 Astrobytes: Timing you out?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539740377">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539740377</a>
 struct: every game is like this
 Scarfield: i considered doing it, but then out of nowhere i didnt
 Astrobytes: Yeah, makes sense. I came to the idea too late tbh.
 Astrobytes: Although it was discussed
 Scarfield: illes company Boitano AS makes me think of this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/sNJmfuEWR8w?t=22">https://youtu.be/sNJmfuEWR8w?t=22</a>
 Astrobytes: gogogo Illedan
 struct: None of current top 3 works for Amadeus right?
 Astrobytes: No, I think Jeff is the highest in Amadeus this time
 Astrobytes: Scarfield :rofl:
 Scarfield: dapo gaining a lead
 Astrobytes: Hehe, it's cheesy, but it's highly effective. GG Daporan
 therealbeef: tight race for 11-16th
 Astrobytes: 9-16 looking at the lb
 struct: Dapo seems to be a clear winner now
 struct: imo
 struct: unless all his remaining matches are 1vs1vs1
 Scarfield: yea, the cheesemeister
 Astrobytes: Possible, but he still gets rekt by Neumann sometimes
 Astrobytes: even 1v1
 struct: maybe I jinxed it
 Astrobytes: Nah, was looking at last battles
 Scarfield: you just need to jinx the top17 and im happy
 Astrobytes: Shut up and accept your top 20 UngratefulField :P
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: I had a previous version that ruined you every time, it just only got to about 30th. Every time :P
 Scarfield: yea i noticed :p
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: stop beating me struct
 Scarfield: never really fixed my bots overexcited behavior, seemed yours was a great counter for that
 Westicles: I'd like to see dapo vs. dapo 
 struct: Dapo defeated france
 Scarfield: it was also to happy to engage in a blocking combat even if it was a fair bit ahead
 Astrobytes: In all honesty I didn't keep track of improvements and such as much as I usually would Scarfield, it was more just fk it this'll do and submit
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was trying to eliminate that too Scarfield, Wontonimo managed to mitigate that behaviour somewhat
 Scarfield: same didnt make any changes over the weekend, but did check the LB more often than i want to admit :p
 Astrobytes: leojean890: we finish around the same rank I think&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: (hope)
 leojean890: Astrobytes yes^^
 leojean890: Daporan, as usual, hides and wins in the end :P
 leojean890: (winning is not 100% sure but..^^)
 Astrobytes: Well, we all know it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: He has a good bot
 leojean890: we had an exclusive french contest organized by sopra steria in january, he did the same xD
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know :D
 struct: holy losing sreak
 struct: streak*
 Astrobytes: If there are good prizes, Dapo will be there. CG contests have no real prizes of any value other than pride so ...&#160;:)
 Scarfield: they always appear in the end of a submit dont they
 Astrobytes: struct: regardless, that was not too shabby for a last minute submit
 Scarfield: how did the word of slcc even get out, i just saw it in chat
 struct: thanks
 struct: you did well too
 leojean890: submit 1 min before midnight, always ^^
 leojean890: he should do RAIC..
 struct: I only submited because it was when bot was mostly ready
 leojean890: 3-3.5k euros for 1st
 Astrobytes: Tough leaderboard
 Scarfield: this was your first working submit wasnt it struct?
 struct: I only submited 2 times
 struct: one with no ai
 struct: or I submited 3 
 leojean890: same, less than 10 submits^^
 Astrobytes: leojean890: you get the email for the RAIC t-shirts etc yet?
 struct: on last 10 minutes I submited the 2 times
 Scarfield: yea you were a solid last place before xD
 Scarfield: nice done man!
 leojean890: No, didn't get the email for T shirts^^
 struct: Thanks
 leojean890: we all will get a t shirt becauseonly need to participate to R2^^
 Astrobytes: cool, just checking. No one has yet afaik
 leojean890: and pullover for people who went to R1
 Astrobytes: Yeah but they send an email to claim usually I believe
 leojean890: I see, didn't receive it:)
 leojean890: pullover =&gt; to finals*
 Astrobytes: Yep. That was an exhausting contest lol
 leojean890: and much money for top 6 so.. Dapo should come
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not sure why he doesn't do RAIC tbh
 struct: maybe for the same reason re curse doesnt
 struct: its a sh*tshow
 leojean890: because too much work to get reward and not enough time&#160;?^^
 Scarfield: how a sh tshow?
 Astrobytes: Who knows.Last RAIC was decent struct. Weird af API but hey :D
 struct: changes mid contests
 Astrobytes: Wasn't anything awful this time around
 struct: true
 leojean890: API no user friendly at all
 leojean890: but nice topic
 struct: this week there is new escape I think
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure what whoever did the C++ API was smoking but I definitely don't want any
 Scarfield: last raic was that RTS looking space ship thing right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 leojean890: yes
 leojean890: it was ok
 Astrobytes: I think I only ever viewed the game in debug mode though D:
 leojean890: but no passionate enough to work on it for 1 month long^^
 struct: Wait there was no debug mode?
 struct: lol
 leojean890: yes alwars in debug.. clearer
 Scarfield: looked pretty cool, but still havent gotten into trying raic
 leojean890: always in debug
 leojean890: because "normal" mode was not understandable
 Astrobytes: That was the first one I went into, I signed up for others but gave up after trying to go through the rules/code
 leojean890: debug mode was useful to understand the games
 Astrobytes: Very, very useful
 Astrobytes: And you could draw on the debug output too
 leojean890: I didn't know RAIC previous years
 leojean890: but was happy to participate this time
 Astrobytes: Was good fun, and we had a lot of CG participants which helped a lot&#160;:)
 leojean890: the user "tourist" does not go to RAIC as well but could I think^^
 leojean890: he wins CG sometimes and google hashcode
 leojean890: and other contests
 Astrobytes: Not really his style I don't think
 leojean890: he is more optim&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Kinda yeah
 leojean890: he did CG when it was optim.. A*C
 leojean890: and google hashcode is optim
 leojean890: maybe he does not bots fights
 Astrobytes: mathematically-based he will destroy all in his way
 leojean890: project euler for example&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I mean more optim/contest style
 leojean890: he was already in the winners before being 10 years old^^
 leojean890: yes Isee
 Astrobytes: Is he on PE? He would slay I'm sure
 leojean890: i don't know, I'm not in PE:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, he was a real child prodigy
 leojean890: I did some kinda-PE-style on CG puzzles&#160;:)
 Scarfield: when i was 10 i think i was still playing viking, and fighting with sticks xD
 leojean890: ^^
 Astrobytes: I lack in some areas of mathematics so some of the more math-y puzzles on CG take me a little longer
 leojean890: I was playing pokemon on my game boy color&#160;;)
 leojean890: yes same.. some of the more math-y puzzles on CG take me a little longer
 leojean890: even among medium puzzles
 leojean890: not only hard and VH
 struct: I spent time on sports instead of math
 leojean890: some medium are difficult because of maths aspects idk
 Astrobytes: When I was 10 I was definitely playing around with programming, but also bmxing off walls and swinging from trees over rivers
 leojean890: same sports and music^^
 leojean890: you pushed me Astrobytes i'm #19 :P
 Astrobytes: I was winning maths competitions at that time though, highschool put me off maths (bad teacher)
 leojean890: maybe skyyker can push me down :P
 Astrobytes: Ah nice leojean890 :D
 leojean890: I see
 Astrobytes: Though I still did top level biology, chemistry and physics :P
 leojean890: I was not bad in math competitions in the early school (kangoo competition) ^^
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I should eat
 leojean890: was 100-200th among french people my age
 leojean890: ow.. less sorry :P
 Scarfield: yea bad teachers sucks, my physics teacher in "high school" seemed to hate me with a passion because i liked philosophy, all the girls got straight a's though. the girls even complained to the board because he was so biased xD
 Astrobytes: I loved maths competitions
 leojean890: 100-200 among not all France students:p
 Astrobytes: Had a few of these types Scarfields
 Astrobytes: *-s
 Astrobytes: Right, going to eat and sleep
 leojean890: some teachers are this way yes..
 leojean890: just wait for next year xD
 Astrobytes: If anyone sees Daporan please give him my congratulations
 Scarfield: he is online, so he should have seen i suppose
 leojean890: xD
 Scarfield: but gn&#160;:)
 leojean890: he's not on the web chat&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: ^
 leojean890: maybe he reads but.. no writing&#160;?:P
 Scarfield: green dot on avatar in lb = online afaik
 struct: He is not
 leojean890: so.. 2 PS5 in 2 months
 struct: mods can see everyone
 Astrobytes: Yeah but that doesn't == webchat
 Scarfield: no mere mortals are not in his interest
 struct: grats on the 2nd controller
 Astrobytes: gg Daporan
 Scarfield: he won ps5 before?
 Astrobytes: Anyway, gn all&#160;:)
 Scarfield: gn&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: gn Astrobytes
 struct: gn
 Wontonimo: and i just got back
 struct: wb
 struct: yes he won Scarfield
 struct: in january I think
 leojean890: he won PS5 for sopra steria contest in january
 leojean890: contest only for french people
 Scarfield: winning 2 ps5 in current conditions is just rude xD
 Wontonimo: my #1 take away from this contest is to leverage ALL the win conditions.  Timing out our opponent is a valid win that I didn't explore much
 leojean890: yeah by hiding xD
 leojean890: but he has a good level anyway&#160;;)
 leojean890: just does not let other good people bench against him
 Scarfield: yea its a little too cheesy for my taste, but not against the rules so gg to him
 leojean890: timing out the opponent.. didn't try that either^^
 Scarfield: im off for tonight as well, gn&#160;:)
 struct: gn
 Wontonimo: I wasn't specifically referring to Dapo.  Others had implemented that agro combat strategy also.  It's more that&#160;: all win conditions of the game must be in the search.  I missed the timeout rule
 Wontonimo: gn
 leojean890: gn
 leojean890: yeah missed timeout as well
 leojean890: cool in 1V1 games
 KelvinAndHubbles: doing Smash the Code, haven't touched the start of the code, but it already says getting just the inputs takes longer then allowed for first turn, wacked
 struct: which language?
 struct: I played stc not so long ago and had no problems
 KelvinAndHubbles: Python, yea it seems it gives up half way through reading the first inputs for the rows\
 KelvinAndHubbles: might need just a refresh or restart or somethin
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, welp spent 90 minutes writing a floodfill and minimax program, and the input doesn't work&#160;:/
 Smelty: rip
 Simpleprogrammer2011: d
 Simpleprogrammer2011: Hi
 TheBestPlayer17: why does it keep erroring on "Not in a function" python3
 ANONYMOUS42: what is the code
 ProfLayton: i've had that error a lot; usually coz i make a bracketing mistake
 TheBestPlayer17: nvm i think its because i was using else if instead of elif
 MrFruit: Hello World.
 MrFruit: Chat

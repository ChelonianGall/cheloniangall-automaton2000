 LLG: what happens if both heroes uses WIND on a spider from the same direction?
 LLG: does it get pushed 2200 or 4400?
 Eltrion: Yes wind stacks
 Eltrion: So it would go the sum of the vectors of all heros that used wind
 pmor: 3 heroes can yeet a spider pretty far
 Eltrion: Yeah I saw some cheese with three attackers
 Eltrion: Pretty difficult to defend against, but they're also just leaving their base to be taken by any mobs that wander in.
 Miki09: Blasterpoard attacks are so smooth
 Kokoz: Hello miki&#160;:)
 Miki09: Hi&#160;:-)
 Miki09: Why are servers so slow?
 Miki09: Im computing my score for like an hour
 _NikJ: 261 computing, that's honestly not THAT many people
 _NikJ: should be faster 
 pmor: Yeah, I've been waiting for mine to finish for 1 1/2 hrs
 actualCoderTrevor: I always find myself thinking codingame should scale up the servers [more] during these contests. This has been better than Spring 2021 though.
 _NikJ: i was 500th in gold when I got promoted, now I accidentally submitted again and fallen to 800th with the same code xd
 Miki09: lol
 Miki09: I was 130 in silver and now I'm testing
 Miki09: Imma implement double push today
 derjack: :upside_down:
 [CG]Thibaud: we're aware of the slowness. There is something wrong with the code machines
 _NikJ: who is "the best" single attacker player atm? I see a ton of double attacks
 pmor: couple days ago I was impressed with eric.lee's bot.  It was a single attacker that was #1 for awhile
 bluecross: gold games count increased yet?
 eulerscheZahl: seems so. 17 games, 12%
 eulerscheZahl: and it's fast again
 derjack: thibaud, is this java code?
 _NikJ: eulerscheZahl are you running 1 attacker only instead of 2?
 eulerscheZahl: i was always at 1 attacker
 eulerscheZahl: except first days with 0
 _NikJ: then it's time to study your moves :D
 eulerscheZahl: waste of time. i don't even properly coordinate defenders. they often share the same position and target
 eulerscheZahl: only casting spells separates them
 _NikJ: and yet you're top 10, it's good enough for me lmao
 _NikJ: I'm doing something very very wrong, but I can't find what yet
 eulerscheZahl: top10 if you send a lot of other players into submit simultaneously maybe
 actualCoderTrevor: Silver boss is very mean :laughing:
 eulerscheZahl: then be even meaner
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626074084">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626074084</a>ate him alive
 actualCoderTrevor: Nice! Thanks for sharing&#160;:)It looks like if two heros control each other on the same turn, it cancels out?
 eulerscheZahl: no, they both succeed. see frame 59
 _NikJ: damn, that attack was smooth
 actualCoderTrevor: Okay thanks
 rafaelSorel: hello guys, anyone has used brutaltester with the referee of this contest&#160;? When I use it, I always have a result equals to zero for both player&#160;!
 _NikJ: I tried, but it kept throwing some magic Java errors regarding log4j, so I just gave up
 SirLoxley: that moment when you think while programming ... hmm I  am not sure this is correct ... and it turns out, it is not correct&#160;:/
 rafaelSorel: for the log4j, you need to set an old version, if your environment is not updated -&gt; pom xml file set the version 2.4.1 in log4j section
 bigrussianmilashka: Hello my friend
 cegprakash: I won't be surprised if eulerscheZahl finishes in top 3 he is doing some magic
 derjack: frog wednesday eh
 Uljahn: DJ Sim and MC Magic :smirk:
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl trusts in team trust over team coordination and it works
 cegprakash: and he wrecks me 100% -_-
 eulerscheZahl: i just failed to coordinate the team and give different targets. i'm convinced that splitting them up can be beneficial in some cases
 eulerscheZahl: but it's complicated, e.g. i want them close together to SHIELD the partner when controlled
 cegprakash: I split up but u wreck me 100% euele
 eulerscheZahl: my bot (as most others) has 2 completely different components: attack and defense.maybe you even have a stronger defense but a worse attacking, who knows
 _NikJ: how fast are the battles right now?
 LaurensD: still not too fast, but by the time it's normalized it'll be the next tier
 eulerscheZahl: got 120 battles in 50min
 eulerscheZahl: it's faster (was 30 in 1h before) but not perfect
 eulerscheZahl: 229 computing
 blasterpoard: I hate it that I lose rating for winning against weak opponent who get me as their 1st game
 DomiKo: #flex
 therealbeef: first world problems eh
 eulerscheZahl: lower your overall rating, that will solve the problem
 eulerscheZahl: submit ended. took an hour to the minute
 blasterpoard: eulerscheZahl ok; I might submit a crashbot for most of legend to fix that
 blakestone: has anyone run into a problem with a challenge where it times out/fails when simply looping through the provided list of items?
 eulerscheZahl: in legend it's ok to have a strong bot again
 blasterpoard: will I get +0.02 for losing then?
 blasterpoard: gotta test it
 eulerscheZahl: no need to hide
 eulerscheZahl: don't be like Ille dan
 wlesavo: euler is it still 40-50 games on submit? 
 eulerscheZahl: no, back to normal
 wlesavo: oh nice
 blasterpoard: btw this version has broken control, defender often controls monsters towards my own base and attackers don't use it often enough
 blasterpoard: its eval is bugged
 eulerscheZahl: eval, first world problems
 eulerscheZahl: this is a heuristic contest, long live True AI
 eulerscheZahl: i think i can't find the forum post anymore&#160;:(
 wlesavo: i have no mechanism to control spider into my own base, the only possibility is to control to the enemy base
 blasterpoard: for (double angle = 0.00; angle &lt;= 6.28; angle += 0.01) { ... }
 blasterpoard: at least that's what I do at depth 1
 eulerscheZahl: mine is similar
 eulerscheZahl: except that i test less angles
 wlesavo: you can safely prune to 3.14 i think
 eulerscheZahl: i mean less intermediate steps
 wlesavo: yeah, i got that
 wlesavo: btw im stealing your shield partner under control heuristic euler
 eulerscheZahl: hmpf, you weren't supposed to do that
 _NikJ: hmm am I completely wrong for only going aggressive when I get to 200 mana? o.O
 wlesavo: i think its a good balance betwwen preemtively over shielding and no shielding at all
 eulerscheZahl: i found the True AI thing, here it started<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/31">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/31</a>
 dbdr: a piece of history!
 Miki09: So I added double push now, but it seems I have bad defender that doesnt defend well.. Imma code it now. See you guys in couple hours&#160;:-)
 Miki09: from #108 to #1900 just because of bad defender...
 eulerscheZahl: you even dropped to a lower league by doing so?
 wlesavo: hm, my alice is not willing to save bob from control, but bob is always there for alice
 eulerscheZahl: evil Alice, don't trust hershe probably also shares Bob's secrets with the MitM
 wlesavo: oh, Alice thinks Bob is dead by design :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: because he's not added to the list of other heroes yet?
 rafaelSorel: eulerscheZahl you are very persistant on mind control :joy:
 Miki09: euler I didnt drop... I hope I wont...
 wlesavo: euler he removed from there before alice simulation by being forcefully killed 
 eulerscheZahl: shield yourself if you don't like it rafaelSorel
 wlesavo: if you count state = DEAD as killing
 eulerscheZahl: killing heroes, that's something new
 rafaelSorel: that's what I am willing to do :D 
 wlesavo: not only my own but even enemies!
 wlesavo: in fact they always dead for now in my sim
 SirLoxley: something broke? I get "Submitted code is too big" as an error
 PHEARD: how many lines do you have&#160;?
 SirLoxley: ~ 2500
 wlesavo: chars
 eulerscheZahl: 100kB code size limit
 PHEARD: hahaha
 dbdr: lol, my sim tries to optimize getting a score as close to 2^31 as possible
 eulerscheZahl: remove all indents (if you don't code in python)
 PHEARD: dude you got to factorize a bit 
 SirLoxley: 101k what?
 SirLoxley: how lol
 PHEARD: every repeating line, you make it a function
 eulerscheZahl: int overflow dbdr?
 SirLoxley: time to kill the comments
 eulerscheZahl: i always use doubles for scoring
 PHEARD: or a method, idk in what language you are coding
 dbdr: yeah, most likely&#160;:)
 wlesavo: lol, both base destroyed, first time i see that<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626123755">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626123755</a>
 eulerscheZahl: not that unusual actually
 wlesavo: for self games should be more likely yeah
 eulerscheZahl: who's alisa?
 SirLoxley: tabs to spaces ... got 16k back
 wlesavo: or maybe i just didnt pay attention
 SirLoxley: (other way round)
 wlesavo: euler in russian Alice and Bob often written as Alisa and Bob
 eulerscheZahl: nice attacking logic wlesavo. you avoid damaging the bugs there
 wlesavo: euler there is some punish in eval for damaging the bugs that target enemy base, eventually some times it even works
 eulerscheZahl: eval, you guys all go for a simulation approach?
 PHEARD: well I don't, how do you do it&#160;?
 wlesavo: My MC is not that far from True AI
 dbdr: look how well it works!
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626128470">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626128470</a>
 PHEARD: Do you guys have a simple way to test a bunch of fights in my everyday IDE instead of codingames'&#160;?
 wlesavo: what a trickster dbdr :smiley:
 dbdr: they want to get out it seems!
 eulerscheZahl: what i do: print stdin directly to stderrthen copy-paste it into a text file. and set my IDE to use this file as stdin
 eulerscheZahl: allows me to play single turns. i don't have any memory on monsters that are now out of view but were visible before. this could complicate things
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to debug the whole thing and not just a single turn:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 aCat: ouh, you dont remember moinsters euler?
 aCat: yep it simplifies but I decided to add this
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm bad at memory
 aCat: and this methot of debugging/testing is great, this cat supports
 Madjosz: I just noticed this chat functionality for the first time. Is it only unlocked after one month of membership?
 eulerscheZahl: but definitely saw a few situations where i should CONTROL the defender away but didn't just because i didn't see the monster next to it
 aCat: you need some level Madjosz
 eulerscheZahl: level 3+ and CG was A-B testing while considering to remove the chat entirely
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know their conclusions and if A-B testing is still on-going
 Madjosz: Hmm, but I've been on that level at least since 1st of April.
 eulerscheZahl: some new users just don't see a chat at all
 eulerscheZahl: CG wants to know if chat affects user behavior or if they can remove it completely
 eulerscheZahl: i would miss the chat&#160;:(
 DomiKo: me too&#160;:(
 Madjosz: Actually I wished I could communicate with fellow clashers.
 Whatar: you can
 Madjosz: So I was excited it was suddenly possible.
 aCat: you have auto open new chat for clashes
 aCat: yep
 eulerscheZahl: some clashers are just bots
 Madjosz: Only problem is that I accidentally hit the close tab often.
 therealbeef: chat is part of the appeal of CG I think
 wlesavo: especialy in the time of contest
 PHEARD: Personaly @therealbeef i didn't notice chat until now, and I've loved CG without it all along
 PHEARD: Although I'll admit that chat is a real bonus and I appreciate it
 eulerscheZahl: you only know what's missing when you got used to it before
 Uljahn: Thibaud said on discord (04/21/2022): "FYI, we've stopped/paused the AB test on the chat for the challenge (meaning everyone should be able to see it). We'll see after the challenge with this AB test which was bugged again"
 eulerscheZahl: ok, so a new round of AB testing later
 PHEARD: Well let's enjoy it while it lasts
 _NikJ: 76 victory, 72 defeat, not great xd
 PHEARD: I'll take this chance to ask you guys, are you all professional developers or are there a lot of casual coders who code in their free time&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i code at my day-to-day job as well
 DomiKo: a lot of students 
 eulerscheZahl: but was active here while i was still a student already
 actualCoderTrevor: I'm a professional developer but I was enjoying codingame before I got a job as well.
 PHEARD: I figured that top ranks are probably all students / professionals
 DomiKo: mostly
 K363: hi
 PHEARD: Okay thanks for your input
 eulerscheZahl: what's the alternative to that?
 eulerscheZahl: retired?
 Miki09: Is double push really worth it?
 PHEARD: Haha I guess, or self taught people who just love it
 eulerscheZahl: we have that too. a physics teacher how switched subjects and now teachers comp sci instead
 wlesavo: self taught ~ student in this sence
 PHEARD: @Miki i guess if you optimize your defender well, it got me quite high in ranking without putting much optimization into it
 Miki09: ok thx
 eulerscheZahl: there's even a triple push in top5
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626144378">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626144378</a>
 kovi: 10 python in top10
 PHEARD: Yeah i've seen the guy, just rushes to your base arround turn 50 and triple push spiders from miles
 wlesavo: was even top2 yeasteday
 kovi: i mean 4 python
 Miki09: Hmm triple push... interesting...
 therealbeef: i don't code much anymore at work (as architect), so these contests are my fix&#160;;-)
 kovi: same
 PHEARD: Mmh I understand, I guess if i stopped developing everyday I'd miss it... And I can see how CG can fix that, it's a great alternative
 PHEARD: Idk who had the idea of this site but thank god this guy exists
 eulerscheZahl: the answer is Frédéric Desmoulins
 PHEARD: Sounds like a cliché french name
 PHEARD: But yeah all I've heard was it's french
 K363: bonjour mon amis
 Westicles: but now is franco-american like spaghettiow
 Westicles: *spaghettios
 AnciukastheChip: heyyy friends
 EcoLis: :muscle_tone1:
 Jaunuolis535: :wave:
 badradsuperbrad: heeeey all
 badradsuperbrad: what's up with the "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction" thing?
 Caticii: your loop didn't finish before it outputted the cmds
 badradsuperbrad: hmm ... it's the same input reading code i've been using the whole time
 kingSelom: How to do the triple push? seems interesting :joy:
 Miki09: In some time just grab all ur players
 Zyk0: Maybe you stacked two commands, forgot to input a \n or something, or return after printing your move
 Miki09: and use wind to "shoot" spiders at his base
 badradsuperbrad: gotcha ... thanks zyko!
 badradsuperbrad: i'll look through it all
 Zyk0: Yw&#160;!
 Caticii: god this spring challenge is gonna kill my brain xd
 daffie: did you see someone actually doing the push&#160;?
 Caticii: ive seen a single push
 daffie: I've been waiting for someone to try that lol
 wlesavo: check twoodhouse games
 daffie: NICE 
 kingSelom: nice so i need the 3 heroes to push at the same time 
 kingSelom: nice
 kingSelom: I will try it out
 _NikJ: 900+ in gold? is that a bit too much?
 Uljahn: not that much compared to the last contest
 LaurensD: SOO SAD <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626180976">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626180976</a>
 LaurensD: got to play with shields hmm
 IvesL: does anyone know what is the max time for clash of codes timeout?
 IvesL: for each test case
 _NikJ: whew, finally top 500
 SabertheLost: did someone hack my, bot. Yesterday I was 200 ranked in silver. Now I´m 536 in gold?
 SabertheLost: is was the ai reduced in complexity?
 SabertheLost: or*
 _NikJ: well, by the time it's all recalculated, many people moved to gold, boss got weaker because he kept losing etc etc
 LaurensD: Time for arena, got a good feeling about this
 LaurensD:  :frowning2:did not start all too well 
 Miki09: GOLD league :grinning:
 Westicles: IvesL, I think for in/out puzzles the timeout is language specific
 nalka0: I don't really understand how vx and vy work? It says this is the x and y to add to actual position to know next position but I don't think that's right...
 eulerscheZahl: it is right regardless of you believing in it
 eulerscheZahl: except if WIND comes into play
 nalka0: Nah there's no wind involved
 eulerscheZahl: edge to base?
 nalka0: Ah kk i got my mistake
 nalka0: nvm
 nalka0: So vy and vx remain unchanged till they enter a base right?
 Samer: guys, a question please, can a hero cast a shield spell on itself?
 nalka0: YEs
 LaurensD: yup
 Samer: thanks! saves me time finding out by testing&#160;:)
 nalka0: I didn't try but he maybe can even cast control on itself
 Samer: I don't see a point in controlling itself, moves works better without spending mana.. but yeah, for the sake of satisfying curiosity, one could try
 actualCoderTrevor: Sure if you want a hero that has good self-control
 nalka0: It could help counter-balancing an ennemy control if you predict it
 nalka0: But i think that's too deep x)
 actualCoderTrevor: Probably better to shield
 nalka0: Since shield takes one turn to activate it wouldn't prevent control casted on the same turn, would it?
 _NikJ: Look at this control war starting at frame 77 lmao <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626202848">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626202848</a>
 eulerscheZahl: we just got a 4th digit in gold size
 eulerscheZahl: did they increase mana font size btw?
 _NikJ: you reckon top 100 to legend, eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: will be much less
 eulerscheZahl: i'm on the edge of passing or not
 actualCoderTrevor: Does it get harder to get into legend the longer it's been opened? Think I remember hearing that in previous contests but don't remember the details.
 eulerscheZahl: the boss will remain the same the whole time
 eulerscheZahl: the longer you are at top gold, the more likely you are to get pushed by some other submits
 actualCoderTrevor: Ah okay, so there could be stiffer competition at the top of gold
 therealbeef: but advantage is that you can test against the boss in the IDE
 Alurian:  (int)Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(5109, 2) - Math.Pow(17630-11478, 2));
 Alurian: can anyone explain why that results in -2147483648
 Alurian: nvm
 Whatar: overflow?
 Tiramon: nvm means you know the reason?
 Tiramon: what was it?
 eulerscheZahl: i question the hypothesis but would have to execute the code
 Alurian: well i take a root of a negative
 Alurian: but it shouldn't be negative..
 therealbeef: i'd expect an error then
 eulerscheZahl: like NaN
 IvesL: @Westicles then it's very difficult to test for some math problems, if the code is optimized enough
 IvesL: sad
 eulerscheZahl: what is (int)NaN?
 Astrobytes: 42
 supraaxdd: based
 Alurian: for some reason it doesn't give an error, but found the bugg

 Samer: that double wind spell seems unfair, no?
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like someone wants to win the contest
 eulerscheZahl: it's not unfair if everyone can do it
 Samer: well, let's say illogical maybe?
 Samer: wind is wind...

 Tiramon: just keep his heroes atleast 2x windrange away from your base ...
 Whatar: yeah but 2wind &gt; wind
 eulerscheZahl: 2 ventilators are stronger than 1, aren't they?
 Stanworld: i was 121 in Bronze... looking for the code...
 eulerscheZahl: yes, we saw that message Stanworld
 Stanworld: finding a big stupid bug&#160;: i was considering mana amount of the opponent instead of mine...correcting....
 Stanworld: play again in the arena...and now i am 118 .... getting only 3 in the ranking&#160;?

 _NikJ: when you wanna push spiders into his base, you dont wanna push him in too
 cegprakash: what a replay eulerscheZahl
 _NikJ: but I wouldn't go that far Stanworld
 Aramang: I would go that far if using 2 attackers
 jordonez: Silver bot destroys me but i have been promoted to gold, why?
 Mattant: jordonez same question lol
 ETET: Hello World
 Aramang: it hasn't quite promoted me but i've gone 250 to 100 in the last couple of hours with no submit
 Raxus: Anyone knows why arena's are so slow?
 Stanworld: nice,  _Nikji wouldn't go that far for now

 aCat: they shouldn't have...
 eulerscheZahl: they do
 Astrobytes: that was noticed some time ago iirc
 eulerscheZahl: but if you open them with the share-replay, they should be saved for posterity i think

 Miki09: default in gold seems pretty stupid
 aCat: default is always the same
 Tiramon: it was also default in bronze ...
 Miki09: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: not always. at coders of the caribbean there was a really strong default when legend opened
 Tiramon: hm can't even get to gold this time ...
 sasieightynine: Why can't I cast a spell on my own hero?
 Astrobytes: sometimes it's the boss from the previous league, sometimes it ain't
 sasieightynine: *shield spell
 aCat: sasieightynine you can cats shield
 Tiramon: sasieightynine no mana, he is shielded ... depends on situation
 Tiramon: out of range maybe
 Astrobytes: cat shields eh aCat&#160;;)
 struct: Hi
 sasieightynine: Say I have a hero with entity id 0, i have enough mana, I cast shield with it to id 0, nothing happens.
 Astrobytes: hey there struct
 Tiramon: give a replay and we can tell you in detail sasieightynine
 Miki09: :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: heuristics is all you need Tiramon. not to win probably but you can get pretty high
 struct: euler the vx and vy have been fixed
 eulerscheZahl: i know, Thibaud wrote it on the forum
 Tiramon: yes my heuristic has a pretty stable defense ... but i'm lacking attack and there are besser farmers than mine
 eulerscheZahl: but thanks for the info
 struct: np
 Tiramon: *better
 sasieightynine: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626295892">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626295892</a>
 sasieightynine: turn 118 - 119
 eulerscheZahl: then you need a besserer Angreifer
 Tiramon: :P
 Tiramon: so you say no gold without attacker?
 eulerscheZahl: there are some pacifist bots in gold too
 eulerscheZahl: but i think 2 defenders + 1 attacker makes it easier
 Miki09: Im at 2+1 now but I think imma go to 0+3&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: so you try to win on mana but still mostly defend in your own base Tiramon?
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds wrong. you don't need a farmer without attackers
 Tiramon: my main target was to get a 100% defense
 Tiramon: gets me to ~960 in silver
 Hackker: why do sometime i got bad command

 Aramang: are they getting any through or only losing on wild mana?
 eulerscheZahl: you just have to make your opponent die before you
 Tiramon: because WAIT is not a command?
 IvesL: @Hackker you dont provide enough outputs
 Hackker: oh
 Hackker: i know why
 Hackker: cuz i print wait not WAIT
 eulerscheZahl: can you share a replay?
 Hackker: dumb code
 LaurensD: uppercase WAIT
 LaurensD: not sure if that matters
 Hackker: that's matter bruh
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's case sensitive? that's unusual
 Tiramon: in spring challenge afaik WAIT is no valit command uppercase or not
 Tiramon: *valid
 eulerscheZahl: WAIT: the hero does nothing.
 Hackker: but it need to be uppercase bruh
 Tiramon: oh there it is ... ok
 Tiramon: so yes uppercase should be the solution
 Hackker: yep i just realize that
 eulerscheZahl: or just move to your current location
 IvesL: @Tiramon are we allowed to discussed specific clash of code problem here?
 eulerscheZahl: yes IvesL
 IvesL: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1812268d710e130ba13978a5abf59d453820">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1812268d710e130ba13978a5abf59d453820</a>
 IvesL: im stuck with this one
 IvesL: cant pass test 7 and 16
 eulerscheZahl: and your code that solves some of it?
 IvesL: all others but 7 and 16
 Tiramon: oh damn i guess this could help .. replace a min with a max ... let's see
 eulerscheZahl: paste your code
 eulerscheZahl: if it doesn't, try average?
 IvesL: how to use the pastebin
 Tiramon: could actually also be a solution&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: just paste it and wait for the magic
 IvesL: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/926fa72a-df73-41dd-a724-080b7639467a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/926fa72a-df73-41dd-a724-080b7639467a</a>
 IvesL: alright
 Tiramon: more than 4 lines gets a auto pastebin
 Tiramon: there was also a char limit but i forgot it
 IvesL: i dont think im doing it correctly actually
 _NikJ: hm, to move to monster.coords or to monster.coords+monster.vectors :thinking:
 Tiramon: i use m.coords + mvector * timeToIntercept
 _NikJ: where timetointercept is in steps I assume? dist / 400
 _NikJ: interesting, I like it
 Tiramon: you can't reach it earlier so moving to just x+vx will waste some time
 Aramang: i use timeToIntercept + 1even tried + 2 for a while
 eulerscheZahl: this one is passing IvesL
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e559c98-cb22-4e52-8785-4e75d4cc0d12">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e559c98-cb22-4e52-8785-4e75d4cc0d12</a>
 Aramang: i also used dist/300 to calulate time for WAY too long but we don't talk about that
 WannaBeHum1n: wait it is not dist/300
 WannaBeHum1n: xD&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: why
 Aramang: because monsters more at 400/turn
 Aramang: move*
 struct: 300 is their attack range
 WannaBeHum1n: oh no
 IvesL: @eulerscheZahl right thanks, so i have done sth extra to it
 Tiramon: hm ok spaming less spells is also a solution ... then i got mana when i need it&#160;;)
 cagriy: HELLO FROM ISTANBUL &lt;3
 isimkullanmiyorum: hi 
 eulerscheZahl: hello from Germany. we don't have caps lock here
 tkankan: Hello from 42Kocaeli!
 cagriy: i am sorry&#160;:(
 _NikJ: Tiramon I personally had coolowns on my spells, but ranked much worse than when I let the bot just spam them
 _NikJ: With attacker I had just spam control like a maniac, spiders in, heroes out
 JulienKerlero: Is there by chance someone who knows Haskell here&#160;?
 Astrobytes: #fr probably has a higher number&#160;;)
 JulienKerlero:&#160;:(
 JulienKerlero: nobody there
 tkankan: hey
 JulienKerlero: np I'll find a way
 ZarthaxX: what do you need JulienKerlero?
 Astrobytes: there'll be more peeps in #fr later
 Tiramon: _Nikj just found out that controling a enemy away while there was nothing to do for him nearby costed me some matches ...
 Astrobytes: zarthaskell 
 JulienKerlero: I'd like to understand how this works and how can I put them all in one line. I'd like to scan the IO inputs&#160;: 
 JulienKerlero: I'm not sure about what I wrote, mainly the return
 Astrobytes: golfing? (putting them all on one line)
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes :rofl:
 JulienKerlero: And I don't get why I can't just put getLine instead of affecting the getLine value to a variable (Im not even sure its what Im doing here lol)
 _NikJ: Tiramon, I cntrol them out only when there's monsters around him and he's close to base
 ZarthaxX: JulienKerlero mmm yeah i think that getLine thing is unnecessary
 ZarthaxX: you can just replace there input_line in the second expression
 JulienKerlero: it doest work
 ZarthaxX: wat
 JulienKerlero: let me show you the error message
 JulienKerlero: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d5c001ca-c757-4217-a264-edbd239e5432">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d5c001ca-c757-4217-a264-edbd239e5432</a>
 JulienKerlero: I feel like I need a return somewhere
 ZarthaxX: does that work if you dont replace it?
 ZarthaxX: because it says it's not matching types
 JulienKerlero: yup it does
 JulienKerlero: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db73850f-c3c0-4fd6-b866-a8cecbd093e4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db73850f-c3c0-4fd6-b866-a8cecbd093e4</a>
 Tiramon: _NikJ the monster around stuff was the spam protection i just added ... was a waste of mana to control him away without anything nearby
 ZarthaxX: okey
 nightwalkerinthedark: lol
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ZarthaxX: maybe you want an fmap JulienKerlero <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14226577/operation-on-user-getline-result-before-storing-in-variable-haskell">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14226577/operation-on-user-getline-result-before-storing-in-variable-haskell</a>
 Tiramon: _NikJ but i also control him away if outside of base ... to prevent the double wind stuff
 ZarthaxX: the problem here is that the getLine is an IO action, not a normal function apparently
 JulienKerlero: yup it seems
 JulienKerlero: should I "read" it&#160;?
 Westicles: needs more gibberish and weird looking punctuation
 HenroLST: WOOHOO
 ZarthaxX: check that link, it uses fmap, maybe that solves it and you dont have to store it in a variable
 JulienKerlero: Oh
 JulienKerlero: maybe I should've use fmap or mapH instead
 Tiramon: hm great seams like i can't reconstruct a bug in my bot because only game i found is non deterministic ...
 Westicles: JulienKerlero which puzzle are you trying?
 JulienKerlero: Dungeons and Maps
 JulienKerlero: I'm trying to get used to the IO system
 JulienKerlero: and some basic Haskell tricks
 JulienKerlero: I want to do next spring challenge in Haskell
 JulienKerlero: cuz Python is too slow and I don't want to learn C, C++ or anything
 JulienKerlero: And funcitonnal programming looks great
 Westicles: well, all 7 published solutions do it in a totally different way
 Westicles: from each other...
 Westicles: (w&#160;: h :_ ) &lt;- fmap (map (\w -&gt; read w::Int) . words) getLine
 JulienKerlero: I was close
 JulienKerlero: x)
 JulienKerlero: I love Haskell
 Westicles: [w,h] &lt;- map read . words &lt;$&gt; getLine
 Westicles: that looks more sensible
 JulienKerlero: isn't &lt;$&gt; just infix fmap&#160;?
 Westicles: lol, who knows
 JulienKerlero: looks like it isn in your example
 JulienKerlero: I'll look more into it
 aCat: euler #5&#160;:-)
 aCat: bu, 6
 eulerscheZahl: i still have no clue what i'm doing
 struct: -_-
 aCat: that is the whole point of heuristic bist :joy_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: usually i have a bigger plan when i reach top10 at this point of the contest. but i'm just trowing in random conditions
 aCat: *bots
 eulerscheZahl: i'm growing optimism about legend. keeping up with the tradition
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: boss selection is now automated btw
 aCat: reall?
 struct: if you are 5th now you probably already made it
 aCat: what conditions - nth leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: they plan bot games as community events. with higher leagues for games such as connect4 and vindinium
 struct: I would say like 50 at worse
 aCat: they used to changed some bot behaviors / make it deterministic, etc
 eulerscheZahl: so they need a boss picker not to do it manually
 aCat: yeah, ok, but for contests 
 struct: My c4 bot can be the boss I dont mind
 struct: As long as its not public
 aCat: like noone checks what AI chose? ;p
 eulerscheZahl: still a human looking over it for the contest (check fr chat)
 aCat: ok

 struct: Just add a killswitch during the contest
 struct: in case it gets chosen as the boss
 eulerscheZahl: i had that for botg to see how stable recalc is
 eulerscheZahl: only activated it after my submit to see how far it climbs
 eulerscheZahl: ended below my true potential. but probably a bad game to test this
 rcrl: Hello, does someone already encountered such an issue&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626300452">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626300452</a>
 rcrl: Frame 89 to 93, spider 55 get off the map in negative coordinates (y) and then come back 2 frames after
 blasterpoard: feature, not a bug
 rcrl: May you explain please&#160;? We're lost&#160;:(
 LaurensD: random respawn I assume?
 rcrl: Nope, it still have the same ID and same health
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/9c319c4a37d98c4153aa1049bcbcc918cd85c290/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L498">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/9c319c4a37d98c4153aa1049bcbcc918cd85c290/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L498</a>
 LaurensD: oh
 LaurensD: indeed it's bordered stuck there
 blasterpoard: if you look at insideMap() function, it removes only spiders that are 800 units away from the border
 rcrl: Oh god damn THANKS
 Kokoz: quick question guys, if I beat the boss I move to gold or I have to beat all other players?Because I beat the boss but I am still silver
 LaurensD: always nice, that the bases are random. I always forget to test it for those two bases lol
 LaurensD: Think it's random in 'test in arena' battle, not sure though Play my code I did beat the boss multiple times
 Kokoz: 95% of the time I beat the boss 3-0, and the other 5% I beat him 3-1
 Yozamu: Hi, is there a way to know what is tested when you submit&#160;? Like just to know the inputs in some way, so we can detect errors
 Kokoz: But I guess I need to beat other players first, because I am 590 silver rank now
 Quidome: It is not about beating the boss but ranking higher
 Miki09: yeah
 Kokoz: I thought that too, but wanted to make sure. Thanks
 LaurensD: Got a new profile picture, what do you guys think? explains me correctly.
 LaurensD: Got a new profile picture, what do you guys think? it explains me correctly.
 LaurensD: seems like there is no edit feature, my bad
 LaurensD: @kokoz when you look at the leaderbord, the boss 4 is between 19 and 20 I think you will have to pass that rank
 trictrac: #thales
 Wizard-Dude: Quick question, how would I find the information of my third hero? Like the x, y shieldLife and so on?  
 LaurensD: the heroes are included when you read the entities
 Wizard-Dude: for me whenever I error out whenever I hit an entity with type = 0 nothing happens? 
 LaurensD: Type you can select what you need,your heroes, enemy herioes, monsters etc
 Wizard-Dude: I mean type = 1
 LaurensD: perhaps you are missing something?
 LaurensD: oh
 LaurensD: that's odd, what error are you getting?
 Wizard-Dude: not an error, I am trying to error out whenever I get an entity with type = 1 so I can see igf I can even find one.  
 Wizard-Dude: oh, found the problem I was reading the input before the scan 
 LaurensD: :clap:
 actualCoderTrevor: Earlier I saw someone mentioning log4j2 errors with brutaltester and how to fix them. Does anyone know the fix?
 actualCoderTrevor: (Is there any way to see chat history further back than what I have on my browser?)
 _NikJ: I was mentioning it, I didn't manage to fix it, though I didn't even try really
 _NikJ: Someone said you needed to revert to some other versiion
 _NikJ: I believe 2.4.1 something like
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh okay thanks. I'll let you know if I figure it out.
 ebkeefe5: Boss 4 is using binary search trees to optimize bro that's why he's so good
 eulerscheZahl: [citation needed]
 Astrobytes: lol, some theory right there
 Astrobytes: ah, guess I fixed my bug
 actualCoderTrevor: _NikJ I fixed my issue with the referee by copying log4j2.properties from src/test/resources to src/main/resources.Then I ran "mvn clean" &amp; "mvn package" and it worked. YMMV of course.
 actualCoderTrevor: For reference the issue I was seeing was a lot of console spam like "ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration..."
 _NikJ: I kept seeing smth like some java class not found inside log4j
 actualCoderTrevor: Might not be the same issue you were having.
 _NikJ: But I believe it was in brutaltester, not referee
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh okay nvm then&#160;:(
 karirafn: Can somebody explain this to me:
 karirafn: MOVE 8815 4500 M1
 BJD: can you show a replay?
 karirafn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626424356">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626424356</a>
 karirafn: the condition for the move command is:
 Aramang: he looks to be standing still, are you reading position from the right hero?
 karirafn: says id is 1
 Aramang: id should be 2 fro that guy
 Aramang: its the third line in your output
 karirafn: you're right
 karirafn: but I parse the id from the input
 karirafn: are those not in the same order?
 karirafn: ah I think I know what's wrong, the array is probably not ordered
 karirafn: :D
 karirafn: No I was calling them in the wrong order
 Joe0: is it against the rules in CoC to search stuff via google/stack-overflow/"the documentations"/etc. to find out how to do something necessary to solve the challenge?
 karirafn: thanks :D
 5DN1L: Joe0 No, it's not against the rules
 Joe0: 5DN1L Thanks!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Joe0: if i copy and paste code from stack-overflow will it violate either codingame's license on my code or stack-overflows?
 Astrobytes: no
 Joe0: ok
 eulerscheZahl: about violating stackoverflow license: that's a tricky question actually (not that anyone would ever find out)
 eulerscheZahl: but any code can be on stackoverflow, it doesn't even have to be the original source of it
 Astrobytes: yeah I guess the technicalities lie on their side, regarding if what people put on there is under some specific license or not
 Astrobytes: *is from code that is under said license
 eulerscheZahl: for my regular job i'm highly discouraged from taking stackoverflow code. in the score of CG i don't see it that critical
 Astrobytes: Yeah, for any commercial use I would not risk that whatsoever. For a clash, I think otherwise.
 eulerscheZahl: 99.9% of the code there are just fine. but big companies (understandably) have some paranoia
 Scarfield: clash action law suit
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Very well played Scarfield!
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: hm, a clash suit or a slap suit? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: did you see john oliver's musical about it?
 Astrobytes: I did not
 _NikJ: Big big companies also have their own platforms, libs etc, so you can rarely find anything useless on SO at that point :D

 Astrobytes: I'll save it for relaxing time later and watch the whole thing, can't go wrong with John Oliver thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: it's an entire musical about insulting one guy
 Astrobytes: lol, sounds good to me
 Astrobytes: man these submits are annoyingly slow
 sidproo: man
 sidproo: hey yall
 sidproo: wait 
 eulerscheZahl: only 2h. was much worse when i was new to CG
 sidproo: chat is there??
 sidproo: man codin game is updated
 Astrobytes: true, it's just annoying is all
 eulerscheZahl: it always was, you just unlocked the chat
 eulerscheZahl: by reaching level3
 sidproo: imma go clash of code
 Astrobytes: to celebrate?
 BrunoFelthes: if my hero use a control or a shield, at a unit, he do the damage too?
 Q12: Is it just me or the site is slow?
 Astrobytes: Contest time. It's slow 
 Q12: Not as usual, even in the contest
 Astrobytes: it'll pass
 Q12: I hope, I barely manage to PLAY MY CODE
 Westicles: this contest is more peasant friendly than normal
 Astrobytes: "peasant friendly" :D
 _NikJ: I like it, but that's because I'm a peasant
 therealbeef: this contest is so cheesable. every league reached with more disgusting lolcode cheese
 Astrobytes: always the same in games favouring if-else-spaghetti
 Astrobytes: gotta out-cheese the cheese
 struct: I dont know why but I struggle a lot in this game
 struct: Maybe because usually I rely on sim and speed
 Astrobytes: yeah, you barely use eval functions 
 struct: that ands ifs
 Astrobytes: or struggle with finding good ones rather
 Astrobytes: amounts to the same thing heuristically speaking
 blasterpoard: I now have 2 copycats in top10, but if I optimize against them, people will see how to correctly play against me as well... guess it's finally hiding time from now on
 struct: Just wait until those that havent submited yet show up
 Astrobytes: yeah, I feel there may be a few
 blasterpoard: oh wait, there's actually 3 already
 _NikJ: I've seen 3-4 going up high and then dropping to bottom immediately, hiding for sure
 TobiasA: i'm actually curious to see their strategy
 kovi: blaster - nice trick to hide that you will player 3def in the end...
 blasterpoard: kovi how about 3attack instead?
 k4ng0u: blasterpoard I guess you are now the meta xD
 blasterpoard: objective achieved
 BrunoFelthes: 3 attack from the middle of the arena
 blasterpoard: BrunoFelthes someone has to do it, with 4x wind
 kovi: too bad there is no control-wind
 k4ng0u: what makes it impressive is to manage to recover when you don't manage to one shot the opponent. Here for instance gaha uses 3 attackers and become out of mana in an almost winning position: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626415795">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626415795</a>
 blasterpoard: well, that is a very 1-dimensional bot
 MindController: Same as yours, no?
 blasterpoard: and it's only 3wind, not 4wind
 struct: all you need is 6 winds
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624292360">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624292360</a>
 _NikJ: I have that replay in my bookmarks
 blasterpoard: MindController I sometimes recover even after running out of mana... it's a bit less hardcoded
 MindController: blasterpoard all I see is that double wind tech
 Waffle3z: why am I in 160th now, my rank stabilized in like 350th when I submitted
 Astrobytes: in case you didn't notice, the leaderboards are not currently stable :D
 k4ng0u: MindController not really blasterpoard has some mechanics that enables him to still sustain the battle even when the opponent is very annoying <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626385949">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/626385949</a>it's not just about gather mobs and double wind
 MindController: k4ng0u Man, Im joking
 blasterpoard: well, control is bugged in this version, offensive shield is just bad  and defender is copied from my #1000 bot, so... not much to see
 blasterpoard: well, I've been thinking about shielding enemy heroes, because I yeet them to the base together with the spiders and then I don't win
 blasterpoard: so that will probably happen, together with defender rewrite, and some adapting to opponent's strategy
 Westicles: hmmm, well that guy who hacked the rng is gonna beat you all
 kovi: is it already hacked?
 Westicles: dunno, just some guy was talking about it alot
 struct: I doubt it will happen
 struct: But what do I know
 Scarfield: still fog, while it would be helpful, its not gonna win in and of itself
 struct: There wouldnt be fog for spiders Scarfield and a lot more stuff
 Scarfield: control
 Scarfield: so there still is a certainty level of spider position
 Scarfield: *uncertainty
 kovi: it is for spawn only
 therealbeef: i think he was nonsensing
 kovi: but it would definitely be huge advantage
 kovi: and untolerable&#160;:)
 struct: how can you even hack the rng when spawns are generated as doubles but given as ints
 Scarfield: you can say a lot on the internet :p
 struct: Sure it might be possible
 Scarfield: "im smart"
 HiImEnvy: Guys, I'm confused about the control, if 2 heroes control the same entity, which will be prioritized&#160;?
 Counterbalance: neither
 LaurensD: median I think
 Counterbalance: both apply, then the average outcome is taken
 Scarfield: "If an entity is being moved via a CONTROL from multiple sources at once, it will move to the average of all computed destinations. "
 struct: and this average is based not on output I tried to output large values to see if it was maxed or not
 therealbeef: it's truncated per vector before averaging
 SmartTrash: hello world
 kiruax: Hello do you have a site like that for VHDL or Verilog plz&#160;?
 geppoz: "the average of all computed destinations" means that first truncate the indicated destinations to speed radius, then the average is calculated, correct?
 geppoz: so no difference if one indicates a near or far control point in same direction, the effect should be the same
 geppoz: right?
 therealbeef: if it's too near, it doesn't get extended to max move distance
 therealbeef: you can stop a spider with control
 therealbeef: although if the vector is zero, it doesn't overwrite the existing velocity
 geppoz: example: spider at (x,y), one controls at (x+400,y), the other controls at (x,y+8000), the spider will move at 45°
 therealbeef: yes
 therealbeef: but if the first is at (x+200,y), it won't be 45 degrees
 geppoz: right. first all commands truncated, then averaged
 geppoz: question: if you receive a flag "controlled" on your hero, in that turn there is no difference in whatever you output for that hero
 geppoz: anything will be ignored, right?
 Gnarco: right
 Tiramon: hm after reprioritizing some actions i win against the boss with 200 mana more instead of 100 mana less could be my solution&#160;;)
 surgutti: when legend league will open?
 Waffle3z: already over 1000 in gold
 [ProPTIT]_samachienhoa: abc
 LaurensD: 22 hours from now likely
 pmor: Did the gold boss change?  I went to bed in silver with no hope in beating it and I wake up in gold today
 actualCoderTrevor: Are hero id's consistent? Blue will always be 0,1,2 and red will always be 3, 4, 5?
 andrefpoliveira: Same @pmor
 Nerchio: actualCoderTrevor yeah
 actualCoderTrevor: Thanks Nerchio
 HarryYo: anybody here who can help me understand a question?
 badradsuperbrad: a question: an interrogative statement intended to derive information or a solution
 HarryYo: it's from my college but can't understand what it asks me to do

 HarryYo: Cz you're a good boy
 struct: so its just to implement it?
 5DN1L: HarryYo I think it's asking what variables you need and what types those variables should be
 badradsuperbrad: Both the boss and your bot continue to play in the arena, iiuc.  tributes, so to speak.&#160;;) 
 HarryYo: Ahh i see
 CherryFalcon: guys what do i do what i cant initialize min and max to the first item in an array
 CherryFalcon: i dont have limits 
 badradsuperbrad: so both the boss and your bot can move up/down depending on how things go, andyyyy.
 andyyyyy: my super advanced algorithm was simply chasing the monsters that are closest to my base
 Joe0: was that intended?
 andyyyyy: It worked for a while until the wind got added
 Joe0: or was it a side-effect of the 'advanced'ness
 andyyyyy: I just had all 3 of my dudes run around and attack the monsters closest to my base 
 Nerchio: the lag on this site is unreal
 andyyyyy: because there's a billion resources to look good
 andyyyyy: better than a static site where you have to download your own testcases
 struct: its fine for me Nerchio

 dbf: anyone submitted recently, is it really ~2 hours are required for full submit?
 Murat_Eroglu: yes unfortunately
 Maldo: In Silver it lasts long
 Q12: if I shield monster in the same turn that the opponent wind her will the shield block the wind?
 Maldo: I thought it might be leeague dependent, because that is when it started
 Q12: It seems it will from the instructions
 Maldo: SHIELD spells are applied to the targets and will only be effective on the next turn, after the next batch of commands. Does not protect from a spell from this same turn. 
 Q12: thanks
 Maldo: RTFM&#160;:)
 andyyyyy: Has anyone done the mars lander problem? How am I suppose to tell what the flat land is
 Vancothis: Any idea of how are calculated the move for the heroes&#160;? like, if destination is further than  800 away

 yhyoxx: i see

 yhyoxx: interesting

 jacek: you can be weaker than boss but better than players below him
 jacek: or above
 Tuo: also ppl proply develop vs the boss and accidentally end up optimizing against it
 eulerscheZahl: and that's why you never want your bot to be chosen as boss
 aCat: meaning downgrade your bot, and resubmit whenboss appear ;p
 aCat: (or sometime before)
 eulerscheZahl: if everyone does that, we even get a weaker boss
 _NikJ: server still dedek?
 raxkin: Mmm, anyone can check this replay, frame 15 and 16. why monster 13 does not get attacked?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626577418">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626577418</a>
 raxkin: 15
 raxkin: At frame 15 it get hit, and at frame 16, even if the ire is more close, it does not get hit????
 struct: you move and then check radius
 struct: then spiders move
 struct: You are problaly trying to attack after spiders move
 struct: but you should do it before
 raxkin: Ohh, i see. I was tring to optimize the pathing by figuring next moves of spiders
 raxkin: Make sense thanks
 blackhat_90: andyyyy: You  can create a vector of the land_y and land_x values, then iterate over the values and find two same-consecutive values for land_y.
 S3v3vn: hi, to passe to new league should i finish the first one in the league or just more than tne boss 
 _NikJ: resubmitted the exact same code by accident and I'm losing every single game now, wth
 andyyyyy: @blackhat_90 thanks I figured it out right after I asked the question lol
 blackhat_90: yw, Im doing the same MarsLander ep2 myself
 jacek: andyyyyy :duck:
 MichExpatMatt: I haven't edited my code in at least 2 days, but in silver I've gone up 700 in rank in as much time, meanwhile my leaderboard score is kinda fluctuating but currently up by .81 in as much time
 Counterbalance: you probably dropped 500 as 1200+ made it to gold
 MichExpatMatt: Yeah I figure that's probably close to the mark
 MichExpatMatt: I know of two big weaknesses on my bot from watching replays, just haven't been tweaking it or adding complexity
 wlesavo: damn i failed my ultimate goal, which was not to track anything in the fog
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized how powerful the multi-wind is. i don't even get the bug in input for a final turn to defend it
 eulerscheZahl: instantly from outside of my base to health loss
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i thought i could place a goalkeeper and push it back
 Dapps: yeah i still haven't found a good defense for it
 eulerscheZahl: also: i'm still within your goal wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: no fog tracker
 eulerscheZahl: bullshit factor is strong with this one. way easier to code than to defend
 blasterpoard: you can scout further away from the base, you can attack before the timing push, you can doublewind the attackers, ...
 wlesavo: I even have a big bonus in eval for insta wind goal, but with one pusher it is not very effective 
 blasterpoard: just delay it and you win
 eulerscheZahl: i know that i can. it just annoys me
 blasterpoard: because when a bot is setting up the push, it doesn't farm mana
 eulerscheZahl: pointless extra effort
 wotroe: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: :monkey: 
 struct: dont spam
 Tiramon: oh nice submit start 9/10 won&#160;;)
 wlesavo: i think i have to track hunters if  i want to adjust strategy based on the opponent strategy, i struggle very hard against 3 defence
 _NikJ: Tiramon, meanwhile I accidentally submitted the exact same code that landed me 300th in gold and now I'm at 1000th losing 9/10 battles, how does that happen lol
 wlesavo: this will be a heuristic which decide how to combine my MCs together, trully heuristically guided search  :smiley: 
 eulerscheZahl: same, i just wait for legend and hope that 3 defenders won't be a thing
 struct: Im about to do heuristics smitsimax
 wlesavo: im afraid there wont be a legend for me if ill not find what to do about it
 eulerscheZahl: any opponent you struggle against? curious if my attacker succeeds
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626601461">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626601461</a> eulerscheZahl this is the most annoying turtlebot right now
 blasterpoard: as far as I know
 wlesavo: anyway i also want to sim an opp to some extent, without tracking this sim breaks my defence
 struct: So are you going to sim opponent attacker only?
 eulerscheZahl: that's some nasty defense
 wlesavo: im only simming opp defence for now, thats works ok even without tracking
 eulerscheZahl: even with 2 attackers it won't be easy
 Whiskee: why does "send parameters to ide" give me a completely different match with the same code? Doesn't always happen, but often enough
 Whiskee: I appreciate that some bots use random, but what's the point if the seed gets lost?
 Astrobytes: switch from AUTO to MANUAL
 struct: maybe you or your opponent are not deterministic
 blasterpoard: it's good that these people can't climb
 eulerscheZahl: left: settings =&gt; expert mode
 struct: you will rarely be able to reproduce matches if opponent has random
 wlesavo: yeah, i struggle against even worse than the one blaster sugested
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/</a>if you want to hardcode your opponent
 Whiskee: "random" always involves a seed somewhere though
 struct: well too bad opponent seed can be random too
 Whiskee: pretty pointless if I can't debug what was happening from the console
 struct: I see your point, instead of getting the game another game is played
 eulerscheZahl: in the past i sometimes made my bot a little random on purpose to make it harder for others to debug vs me
 struct: The best way is to make them bench against old ais, just make it select any of them randomly
 Tiramon: hm ok after 19 games around 530 ... thats much better than the previous 800-900 ... i hope i make it to gold that way
 Wontonimo: big brain, my bot is bad on purpose to make it harder for others to debug vs me
 Whiskee: well that's a strat
 Wontonimo: 4.5 days left of this eh?  Don't know if I'm going to be able to find the time to place well
 Astrobytes: 4.5 days should be enough time for your submit to finish at least
 Wontonimo: lol
 Tiramon: atleast with a bit of luck ...
 Astrobytes: I'm almost at 5 hours now
 jacek: :sleeping:
 Tiramon: hey 23 games in 17 minutes ... not that bad ...
 Whiskee: I'm actually surprised that the load is this high. Last year was MUCH more computationally intensive with all the sims
 Tiramon: in 1-2h i should reach 100%
 Whiskee: most bots now are just winging it with heuristics
 Astrobytes: Tiramon: my 5 hours was silver to gold
 struct: Just do 1 submit to legend
 struct: it works
 Astrobytes: so if you hit gold it'll be a while again, though gold is a lil faster than silver was earlier that's for sure
 struct:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, is that your plan again struct
 struct: no
 Tiramon: my primary goal is still to reach gold ... everything above that is just nice to have
 struct: I just cant code
 struct: dont know why
 yhyoxx: same
 Astrobytes: It took me a monumental effort to force myself to fix my code
 struct: I never coded heuristic bots
 struct: only fantastic bits and that was a long time ago
 wlesavo: so you are noot a true AI programmer
 IvesL: i like fantastic bits
 _NikJ: by far my favourite of all :D
 Astrobytes: lol wlesavo
 IvesL: really enjoy it
 jacek: whats the new name of it
 IvesL: what flyer
 Astrobytes: er.. broomstick flyers...
 struct: broomstick flyers
 jacek: why would they change it oO
 IvesL: they said copyrights
 Astrobytes: Especially to such a shamefully bad name
 struct: fantastic beasts
 jacek: is fantastic copyrighted?
 jacek: i would have never guessed
 _NikJ: but it's bits
 struct: Neither would I
 _NikJ: doesn't explain why many other got renamed too
 wlesavo: struct oh, i didnt even get that reference
 _NikJ: BUT
 _NikJ: my theory is that they changed all old names so that people can't so easily "google" the solutions and just copy paste them too boost their profiles?
 IvesL: lmao
 Tiramon: 22% and 290 ... i'm hopefull it might be enough
 IvesL: all those were from movies
 IvesL: but i do prefer to old names
 Astrobytes: _Nikj: no it was to prevent any corporate lawsuits due to the takeover by CoderPad, a US firm
 IvesL: new names lack creativity
 struct: at least comunity contributions fall under a different license
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 _NikJ: Oh, the typical butthurt US
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jacek: 5%ware?
 Astrobytes: afk a bit
 _NikJ: I wouldn't be surprised if I saw a lawsuit, parent suing their child for "stealing" their last name - COPYRIGHT B**
 Westicles: my balls clashes are gonna be the centerpiece when they do the IPO
 IvesL: anyone played the code certification thing?
 struct: yes
 _NikJ: I just saw my bot use control on 5 mobs, pushed them all to enemy spawn, then turns around, uses wind on enemy and pushes all of those monsters away too xd
 IvesL: is it always &gt;99%?
 _NikJ: IvesL it's ridiculously easy, pretty much like any clash
 struct:  well mine was
 _NikJ: IvesL no, you have to "ace" it, you need 100% on all 3-5 tasks
 struct: I got max score and only 99%
 IvesL: i dont have max, i lose few points
 _NikJ: but if you mean does it every say 100%, no, it's always &gt; 99%
 IvesL: but 99
 IvesL: so i wonder what would be lower than that
 struct: if they want to save db calls they can just &gt;= 0% then
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/JctQL4H.png">https://i.imgur.com/JctQL4H.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can score less than 99%?

 eulerscheZahl: i have some objections
 IvesL: &lt;1% or 0% is obviously quitting

 _NikJ: actually, it's possible to "fail". It happened to me that all proposed test cases were a success, but then 1 validator failed. The REASON it failed was because I used int instead of long long. Which is kinda dumb, because it passed the testcase, but oh well :D
 IvesL: just curious how things work behind
 struct: _NikJ but thats actually fair
 struct: you must read the statement
 struct: and check constraints
 Westicles: only one more approval needed for start-up multi
 eulerscheZahl: i did the same mistake a few years ago at codejam. int overflow...
 eulerscheZahl: link Westicles?

 jacek: why there are some many french in the lb oO
 eulerscheZahl: UI of that game could take some love

 Nerchio: 72k chars
 SirLoxley: just submitted 92k
 Nerchio: I mean i could probably trim like 600 lines but too lazy

 struct: I have a script to remove Jacek from board games
 HoriMiyamura: thanks, the current is still ok
 struct: to feel better
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626786627">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626786627</a>
 Noyotens: where is the problem
 Noyotens:&#160;?
 Tuo: maybe conserve/ farm more mana in the start, early winds dont really do anything
 Tuo: then blast away later&#160;:)
 bluecross: ^ unless u are Zylo who can in 44 turns
 bluecross: *who can kill all 3 lives in 44 turns
 Noyotens: @Tuo, id think so bc i always have enough mana
 Noyotens: any advice to defence
 Noyotens: better
 Tuo: ah then im thinking too far ahead, just looking at mana always &lt; 50. Later leagues a single proper attack or defense can cost well over 100 mana each
 struct: Noyotens try to move to where you can intercept the spider
 struct: instead of the coordinates its at
 Noyotens: struct, OK
 struct: Im not sure how much or if it will help at all
 struct: but its worth a try
 Samer: Noyotens I do what struct suggested, it works very well for defense
 Samer: but mostly, you need to guard your base perimeter and use wind to cast spiders outside your base when needed
 Samer: like in here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/626674841">https://www.codingame.com/replay/626674841</a>
 struct: What rank are you Samer with that strategy?
 Samer: still in silver rank 271, I've only implemented defense for now
 Samer: defense only gets you this far
 Zyk0: i'm defense only too 785 gold
 Rikus: I got to gold with _just_ defense
 Rikus: but it was pretty aggro on getting wild mana
 Zyk0: Yeah same, I'm just a wild mana farmer + defender rn
 Samer: then i'll be sure to check out your games guys
 44AA44: Guys check this out lmao: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playfreeminecraft.farted.net">https://playfreeminecraft.farted.net</a>
 Zyk0: not clicking
 Astrobytes: No.
 44AA44: Bruh
 44AA44: do it
 Astrobytes: struct
 44AA44:&#160;?
 Zyk0: &gt; do itI'm getting convinced
 struct: please coding related stuff
 44AA44: I coded this website with HTML &amp; JS
 Astrobytes: go tell some web devs
 struct: ok but dont link it here
 44AA44:&#160;;;(
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 44AA44: Yay&#160;:)
 44AA44: Thanks ASM
 Tuo: "Ah, the exact center of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems like a logical place for spiders to congregate."
 ASM_MOV_INT: I didn't click it, I was laughing at the treatment you got....!
 Tuo: but it wasnt
 44AA44: Oh&#160;;;;;;(
 44AA44: It would be funny if you clicked it
 44AA44: Do it in incognito/vm if ur that scared
 44AA44: I promise its funny
 Astrobytes: sigh
 Tuo: obv they spawn from sides so should farm there
 ASM_MOV_INT: searching for a spare device I can risk....! rofl
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm at work
 Ayza: doubt anyone would click a site called playfreeminecraft.farted sorry man
 Astrobytes: Next tutorial: choosing a domain name
 44AA44: agitated-tereshkova-37cec4.netlify.app
 44AA44: Its literally just hosted on netlify
 ASM_MOV_INT: put it on itch.io
 Astrobytes: tell reddit or something
 ASM_MOV_INT: loaded it on a spare tablet, but it doesn't do anything but show a minecraft load screen
 Westicles: somebody help struct with his strategy
 struct: ^
 44AA44: ASM click the buttons
 44AA44: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://playfreeminecraft.itch.io/playfreeminecraft">https://playfreeminecraft.itch.io/playfreeminecraft</a>
 44AA44: there its on itch.io
 struct: next one is a ban
 Zyk0: Okay I checked your games struct, maybe after having gathered 75 mana like you did, you should ban 44AA44
 Astrobytes: lol
 44AA44: struct is a poo poo head
 Astrobytes: Wowzers. 
 struct:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Folks: it's the mildest troll on the internet
 Zyk0: what is your strategy struct
 cegprakash: i don't know if I can judge my bot as bad as it loses against my own buggy previous bot
 struct: Zyk0 no strategy yet
 struct: I think im going to try 3 defenders
 struct: and farm outisde with them
 Zyk0: Yeah that's a good startI did that too at first, then realized I had a spare hero not required to defend, so I threw it farming but around enemy base
 Zyk0: Hoping sharing spiders hp with enemy would make him farm less mana than me
 struct: I see
 Zyk0: You do not wind yet, right&#160;?
 struct: I do but its very weak
 struct: my submission is like 2 ifs
 Zyk0: Oh okay you do it only when it's hitting your base next turn, I was doing that at first
 daffie: heroes do one point of damage to enemy base too?
 struct: no
 struct: heroes only hit spiders
 daffie: has anyone tried?
 struct: well yes
 Tuo: that would make the game a sprint to enemy base&#160;:)
 Zyk0: One issue, is that it makes your heroes walk back too far in base, so you lose vision around your base + you have to walk back outside + the mana you get from that spider isn't wild, so won't benefit end score
 struct: My current goal is to not even let spiders inside the base radius
 Zyk0: Yeah this is better already
 Zyk0: You might want to let them in also, by one stepSo that when pushing them out, they change direction randomly
 Zyk0: I think it's the behavior right&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Zyk0: I'm not too far from the things I just said btw, in my recent submission
 Zyk0: I mean lastStill no attack
 struct: you on gold?
 Zyk0: Yeah, when it opened I got pushed straight to gold
 Zyk0: I need to go, good luck!
 struct: thanks
 struct: and thanks for the tips
 Zyk0: you're welcome!
 Astrobytes: wow, JS almost #1
 Astrobytes: don't see that too often
 cegprakash: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 cegprakash: RIP testing
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: take a rest for a bit, do some refactoring or whatever, it's really annoying but nothing we can do
 cegprakash: games are too random with different seeds
 cegprakash: can't find which bot is better
 cegprakash: unable to judge lol
 cegprakash: I'm using CG play button like brutal tester
 Astrobytes: careful you don't get locked out for hours
 struct: perks of being a mod
 struct: you wont hit the limit
 Astrobytes: yeah right :P
 cegprakash: make me mod
 cegprakash: till contest ends
 cegprakash: I can pay
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 cegprakash: how much for mod
 Rikus: 14 mana
 struct: I only have 2 commands cegprakash
 struct: I can show them to you if you want&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I know one of them
 cegprakash: muting from chat..
 cegprakash: coz I've been muted
 struct: really?
 struct: I dont know that one
 Astrobytes: there used to be a js addon script that added a mute button
 Astrobytes: used to use it when cyber punk was spamming
 struct: I like my method better
 Astrobytes: which is?
 struct: ban
 Astrobytes: oh lol, not a mod script, was just a user script a few years back
 struct: I still use azkelas script
 struct: despite it being a bit buggy now
 struct: So that console output is bigger
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, I liked that script
 Astrobytes: my browser didn't
 Astrobytes: alright, submission finished at 497th, that'll have t o do for tonight
 struct: you are on gold too
 struct: nice
 Astrobytes: yeah submitted in silver about 3:30pm and finished about 5 hours later in gold
 Astrobytes: get testing now while it's quiet
 Astrobytes: anyway, gonna get some rest, gn
 struct: gn
 EvModder: is there a way to copy code from arena back into IDE?
 EvModder: i messed something up and i can't figure out what lol
 Samer: click on History
 EvModder: thanks
 Samer: you should see all the submissions to arena, and send to IDE
 Psyho: history has all of your submissions
 Psyho: (slow scrolling)
 Samer: Psyho aren't you missing a C?
 Psyho: 😓
 connord234: hello
 Samer: hello
 struct: hi
 connord234: im very new to coding can someone recommend a language thats easy to learn
 Floofyboy: maybe python
 struct: I would say python
 Floofyboy: i'm not new but currently learning python, its not too complex
 struct: But I dont know python, I just recommend what I see the most
 connord234: ok thank you
 struct: Some say its like typing in english
 connord234: wait python3 or python?
 struct: python 3
 struct: its not magic though
 struct: it will take time to learn
 Dcoder789: what do want make with code choses the language in most cases
 Floofyboy: some code is easier with some language for sure, but in a work environnement u don't always have the choice tho.
 pychainman: Has any AI or reinforcement techniques worked for this contest, my initial assumption is it may be to slow to simulate or do anything.  
 pychainman: Guess can train a model offline in games maybe. 
 struct: Im not sure if anyone tried
 struct: I know some people did for other games
 struct: last contest winner was NN
 Samer: I think it's a bit hard because of the fog of war maybe?
 struct: no idea, I never tried to do a NN
 pychainman: yeah, I don't even know how to get started with NN, also don't have time at the moment to try to figure it out. 
 therealbeef: might have a stab at NN for state evaluation if I can find enough time
 therealbeef: but 50ms is tight
 Westicles: him, I wonder who kouin is really
 struct: What rank is he at Westicles?
 struct: Cant find him
 struct: ah I see
 struct: broken bot
 Westicles: was 2nd now hiding
 struct: ok I see
 struct: Should be obvious who it is
 struct: Only 2 persons possible
 struct: 2 due to the avatar name
 issamelimrany: Hello Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's a great way to learn
 kouin: wdym who i am :thinking:
 struct: thinking emoji
 struct: now its reduced to 1 person
 kouin: kouin mean "ok yeah" in french
 struct: hm so you know french
 Westicles: I think it is Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker
 struct: didnt know she was a heuristics master
 Tracy_Yi: Anyone could tell me how to change the language setting from Python to c++&#160;?
 Wontonimo: top center
 Wontonimo: drop down that has the word "Python 3"
 Wontonimo: click it, and choose c++
 Tracy_Yi: "Discover" dialog?
 Wontonimo:&#160;?? no.  go into a competition
 Wontonimo: or a coding challenge
 Wontonimo: where the code is presented to you
 Tracy_Yi: Oh, I see. Thanks so much!
 Wontonimo: np :grin:  Good luck and enjoy
 andyyyyy: Is c++ good? it seems overly complex.
 Wontonimo: wdym good?
 Wontonimo: it doesn't give to charity nor is it a RLM
 andyyyyy: What is the point of it when there are better options? I recall Bjarne Stroustrup himself only rated his knowledge of C++ as "7/10" in a presentation. 
 andyyyyy: therefore that makes me think it is very complex
 Wontonimo: no, the core of c++ is simple
 Wontonimo: *simplish
 andyyyyy: How can it be simple if the C++ coding standard is like 1000 pages long and it has ten bazillion keywords
 Wontonimo: it is all the libraries to do extra stuff that is tha hard part
 andyyyyy: the coding standard alone is extremely long.
 Wontonimo: i'm not sure where you are going with this.  seems like you are trolling or looking for an argument
 Ayza: no one learns all these keywords though
 Wontonimo: if you want power and the ability to tell the computer exactly what you want, C++ is great.  if you want easy of coding but lack of control  or power then Python
 Ayza: you probably care about a few of these bazillion keywords you're talking about
 Wontonimo: ^^ spitting facts
 andyyyyy: I was just thinking C can be useful to learn even if not practical, but otherwise people came up with Golang or Rust for a reason (reasoning seeming to be flaws of C++)
 andyyyyy: therefore that led to me questioning the value of C++ :thinking:
 rwilson: best reason to know C++ ... 
 rwilson: #1 reason C++ exists ( to be a better C , that people could start using cause their job required C at the time )
 andyyyyy: But has it perhaps become antiquated at all?
 Wontonimo: why are you asking?
 andyyyyy: Literally just curious lol
 Ayza: true, google's the best
 Wontonimo: google it.  use google trends to see the adoption and market share
 rwilson: maybe ...  but how many millions of lines of code out there ... companies still use it , regardless of your individual taste
 andyyyyy: Google naturally has a conflict of interest to push Golang and the cute gopher onto me
 Wontonimo: have you used google trends?
 Wontonimo: you really think some random person here has better info than  what you can find on google?
 andyyyyy: As for adoption and marketshare, that led to me getting even more confused. Because the big Stackoverflow survey showed very weird technologies commanding the highest salaries
 rwilson:&#160;:) I'm sure there's a good spot on the Codingame discord for the discussion ...   but @andyyyyy , i get the impression that most peeps here would PREFER to chat about things more directly relevant to the current competition .... 
 Wontonimo: yes, thank you rwilson.  well said
 andyyyyy: Okay fair enough!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: impractical and antiquated are basically fighting words, lol.  and I use a lazy lang. mostly. smh.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like the ref has changed, has it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not seeing the same shield control simultaneous rsult as yesterday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rsult= result
 rwilson: Latest commit fbb4d12 22 days agofor referree ( if it's changed, they've not pushed it up yet )
 rwilson: @PatrickMcGinnisII curious, so you're not seeing control target &amp;shield on the same turn working?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yesterday if you control and enemy shield... both would happen,  today i'm seeing the control taking precedence...i could be wrong tho
 Wontonimo: here is a recent change <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/commit/ad00f9ff28124bf78438b692441d3b5968694cff">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/commit/ad00f9ff28124bf78438b692441d3b5968694cff</a>
 Wontonimo: and here is the commit log <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/commits/main">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/commits/main</a>
 rwilson: TY @Wontonimo , :face_palm_tone3: looks like I was stuck looking at an older branch
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, maybe it's the precedence of adding mobcontrols... so maybe it makes a difference
 rwilson: @PatrickMcGinnisII , the controls should all get resolved in a big pile, then later shields get applied
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i get it, ok, it clears the active controls for heros later in the list.  So it wasn't mob controls, it was me trying to cast a shield on same hero that was being controlled
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and messages are cleared as well

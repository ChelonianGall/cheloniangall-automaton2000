 EFA2020: hey:yum:
 gugrbywitkr: is it possible that on CoC test cases i get 0% and 100% on submiting?
 Lord_Binary: they aren't the same tests, so technically it should be possible
 derjack: oO
 EFA2020: HEIIO IAM UNDER WATER
 ProCoder03: I am writing a simulator, my first one, its for search race.... 
 ProCoder03: In the expert rules, you have `The car rotates to face the target point, with a maximum of 18 degrees.`
 ProCoder03: How do do that&#160;??
 ProCoder03: *you do
 derjack: check out the search race forum
 ProCoder03: Okay!!
 struct: you can also try to check magu s csb tutorial
 struct: similar physics
 darkhorse64: This means that, during a turn, the car may turn no more than 18 degrees

 Uljahn: search for a tutorial race, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's hard to tell the difference between the two
 struct: Automaton2000 help me
 Automaton2000: i just have to make a better one
 derjack: Automaton2000 do you like connect 4 memes
 Automaton2000: if you are not a native english speaker
 ProCoder03: does "Automaton2000" command work  only in world chart or will it work even in private chats&#160;??
 Automaton2000: what you guys mean now, but i have to do a full search

 Chimamire: hi
 Chimamire: .
 BeginnerCoder1: Hello
 z19ma: Just solved my first puzzle.....took me up to five hours :laughing:
 Lord_Binary: good job z19ma!
 derjack: onboarding?
 sprkrd: 5 hours in onboarding may be justified if you don't want to follow the tutorial's proposal and look for a seed for a rng such that all the tests pass :V
 sprkrd: Actually I don't know if that's possible, haven't tried it myself :joy:
 sprkrd: Btw, hello everybody, long time no see
 z19ma: What's onboarding?
 sprkrd: the tutorial puzzle
 sprkrd: I'm guessing it's not the one you solved
 sprkrd: Probably you were busy with Thor?
 eulerscheZahl: profile says he did solve the onboarding
 z19ma: I solved tempearatures actually

 struct: well royale was first yesterday
 struct: now its robo
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 RoboStac: seems very similar to c4 - convolution looks good but bigger dense networks work much better in practice
 struct: the games seem kinda similar
 struct: both have traps
 derjack: dense networks? as in one-hots?
 RoboStac: it's not technically one hot as empty hexes don't have inputs
 derjack: but conv should work better with neibghours-aware games
 RoboStac: yeah, I think it's just too slow
 Wontonimo: it'll be interesting to see if someone here on cg finds a way to do fast conv
 sprkrd: Hey Anton
 sprkrd: How are you?
 Wontonimo: Hey sprk.  I'd doing well thanks.  How you doing?
 derjack: random nn link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dblalock/bolt">https://github.com/dblalock/bolt</a>
 sprkrd: I'm good, finally back to CG after a month or so
 Wontonimo: what have you been up to?
 sprkrd: Vacations, mostly, and also attending some chores
 Wontonimo: that is a really cool nn link.  bolt looks really impressive 
 SteindelSE: ^
 Wontonimo: love the sense of humour "Bolt stands for "Based On Lookup Tables". Feel free to use this exciting fact at parties."
 Wontonimo: anyone solve the 4th test in "sudoku solver" without doing it offline?
 Wontonimo: oh, nvm, i can check the other solutions
 sprkrd: If you're asking is because it's challenging and now I wanna try it
 derjack: did anyone solve 2nd case of temperatures?
 Wontonimo: ah.  i see it now.  silly me
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes but offline derjack
 Wontonimo: yeah yeah ... make fun
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 radoslawgrochowski: Can i somehow increase difficulty of clash of code? 
 sprkrd: you're a bunch of meanies :angry:
 sprkrd: radoslawgrochowski I don't think you can
 BlaiseEbuth: thanks
 sprkrd: The difficulty is essentially random
 radoslawgrochowski: sad&#160;:/
 derjack: welp, you can do private clash, and to make it 'difficult', make codegolf in java :imp:
 sprkrd: there really isn't anything more verbose than Java, is there :joy:
 struct: There is my code
 sprkrd: do you write software patterns and enterprise code for coding CG bots?
 sprkrd: (as enterprise as a single source file can be, that is)
 derjack: is bitboarding enterprise enough?
 sprkrd: I would say that's the opposite of enterprise
 struct: if I show my code I wont get hired
 sprkrd: I guess it depends on the coder, but bitboarding sacrifices clarity to gain efficiency
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition</a>
 sprkrd: not that all enterprise practices enjoy the benefits of clarity, mind you
 sprkrd: ^ derjack provides a fine example of the later :joy:
 struct: I dont feel like bitboards sacrifice clarity 
 struct: At least for me
 derjack: if you wrap it in class and exposes readable method names
 sprkrd: Which is why I said it depends on the coder. Still, I think it takes further effort to make it clear
 struct: struct{private:} &gt; class {}
 sprkrd: it's not like an array of Cell objects with Pieces or Tokens or whatever
 sprkrd: My point is, "bitboarding" is not the Alan Kay way, it's a technique that you throw in for efficiency, and then you can throw in all the encapsulation you like, but it's not readable code by default, but I don't think you would use bitboarding to implement the referral of a competition here at CG
 sprkrd: too many buts
 sprkrd: I rest my case :joy:
 Wontonimo: well, i learnt some python optimization.  seems obvious in hindsight.  Also went back and updated my temperatures test case 2 to not need offline computation
 struct: o.o
 Wontonimo: (joke from above where I was roasted)
 struct: I need to update my temperatures to include avx
 Wontonimo: i'd love to see the expression on some noobs face looking at the solutions and seeing that
 struct: I think I can make it easily
 struct: I think i have code for that lost somewhere
 cboyka: hey
 cboyka: I need a help,
 cboyka: in the Scrabble puzzle, 9th test
 cboyka: from the above array, they are expecting the word 'power' as the answer,
 cboyka: both the 'poowers', 'powers' words gonna get save score, 
 cboyka: according to the given conditions,
 cboyka: If two words win the same number of points, then the word which appears first in the order of the given dictionary should be chosen.
 EFA2020: we don't care
 cboyka: oh, ok. thanks
 EFA2020: :sunglasses:
 cboyka: :thumbsup:
 EFA2020: you don't need help you must to solve it by your self to become stronger
 struct: cboyka cant repeat letters
 struct: on the same string
 BlaiseEbuth: You just need to learn to read carefully... Both the statement and the test's names.
 BlaiseEbuth: And test content...
 BlaiseEbuth: Just read carefuly.
 cboyka: I am using only the distinct letters on scoring
 BlaiseEbuth: That's wrong
 cboyka: ok.. now I got it....  But I really appreciate your help guys.
 cboyka: Sry, if i interrupted your conversations.  
 BlaiseEbuth: You didn't. Don't listen to EFA...
 cboyka: :slight_smile: Thanks.
 JLukeSkywalker: never be afraid to ask for help in here or on the discord, if someone thinks it is interrupting other flow, they would just then dm you with help
 cboyka: Thank you so much guys.
 cboyka: I am new to this place, 
 IndecisionTree: Hey, does anyone have any beginner-friendly resources to get better at Optimization &amp; Bot Programming? I read some posts about monte-carlo, genetic algos, ML, or just complicated rules, and it all seemed really over my head.
 Hjax: i would recommend picking a single game and trying it, starting with something simple and learning more as you go, once you understand the game you can read the post-mortems on the forums to learn about the approaches other people took
 BlaiseEbuth: +1000 to that
 MohED: I am just asking how to get better in coding and programming like some guyes who are just fantastic on this platform
 struct: practice 
 BlaiseEbuth: Pick some simple game and go
 Alshock: well there's no magic tip about "how to become excellent"
 BlaiseEbuth: "be like me"
 MohED: yes, soon If I practise
 Alshock: oh please don't be like blaise, really
 MohED: I think I made a mistake by not starting from the bottom
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 Hjax: yeah the secret is that theres no secret, just keep working at it 
 Alshock: you'd have to practice torturing people for decades anyway
 MohED: why we do not get over blaise
 Alshock: I' playing 2048 right now, I'm amazed how an incredibly stupid bot is infinitely better than me T=T
 MohED: the bot is not the smart one, the guy who program it is
 Alshock: well, that's pretty much the opposite most of the time
 BlaiseEbuth: the bot is not smart, you're just bad
 Alshock: a good bot starts with a very stupid way of making use of the machine incredible computational power
 IndecisionTree: thanks Hjax. I was just asking in particular because i got a 100% at CvZ and then got stuck as to how to continue. The only rule i could think of is go to the nearest person that could be saved. Then i read about people simulating and using fancy algos and that was intimidating 
 Alshock: then you can start being subtle
 Alshock: we usually simulate too early. It's important to try some stuff like "going to the closest person" first
 BlaiseEbuth: IndecisionTree that's not complicated. Especially on CvZ. You can try simulating easily
 JLukeSkywalker: when i do most bot puzzles I hardcode a strategy first, improve it, then move on to the fancy algos
 Hjax: IndecisionTree some games are more compatible with certain algos than others, for instance if you wanted to learn monte carlo tree search, starting with ultimate tic tac toe or othello would be good places to start, i havent really done any of the optimization puzzles so i cant really give any advice there 
 Alshock: then ofc you'll need a simulation if you want your bot to realize some counterintuitive save orders without monstruous flowcharts
 BlaiseEbuth: Simulation + AG on CvZ is a good way to start trying complex things
 NotGoodatall: does anayone use JavaScript
 BlaiseEbuth: Even simu + MC in fact
 NotGoodatall: I use it
 Alshock: 2048 is both satisfying and nerve wracking, every game takes 31 seconds
 IndecisionTree: I see. I guess ill try simulating then applying MC. Sounds kinda daunting but there's always Google. Thanks for the help everyone!
 BlaiseEbuth: MC is just a nerd way to say "test random moves and keep the best one"
 BlaiseEbuth: The only difficult part is to get a correct simulation
 Alshock: not exactly, you need to quantify your random first
 Alshock: unlike AG
 Alshock: GA*
 BlaiseEbuth: "quantify your random" :thinking:
 IndecisionTree: Would it be possible to score well without using MC, GA, or ML? If so, how do people come up with the hardcoded rules? As said, my implementable ideas ran dry after "go to closest person that can be saved"
 Alshock: your turn options, if they're completely random then MC can't reach depth 2
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Yes of course
 Alshock: IndecisionTree you can always do simpler: you can try random simulations and just keep the best one for instance
 Hjax: IndecisionTree if you are just coming up with hard coded ideas, i would recommend watching other agents solve the problems and see what they seem to be doing better
 Hjax: you can also watch your own program mess up and think about how that mistake could have been prevented
 struct: I think the "easiest" way is to create a sim and the the eval
 struct: Then you imrpove the eval to progress
 Alshock: that depends on the sim complexity
 Alshock: remember pacman's collisions
 Alshock: and CSB ofc
 struct: true
 struct: But if I see a game like pacman I close the tab
 Alshock: xD
 struct: There are plenty of resources for csb
 Alshock: on the paper the sim seemed easy
 Alshock: that was so misleading
 struct: There is also code
 Alshock: if testing is doubting, reading is cheating
 struct: you can learn by reading
 Alshock: (that' also true for reading the statement)
 struct: there is a difference from reading and understanding and just reading and copying
 Alshock: sorry I was juste trolling ^^ofc reading postmortems (and simulations skeletons for that bitch CSB) is a very good thing
 Alshock: well well well, if that isn't a random timeout in my code again

 JHowell: Seriously, how do I finish a code clash in 61 seconds, get 2/5 place and go down in my Code Clash rank?

 struct: maybe the player that won had lower ranking than you
 struct: and all the others also had
 struct: in multiplayers you can lose elo by winning a game
 JHowell: The winner had a higher ranking.
 JHowell: That's pretty stupid to have your rank go down even if you win...
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: yup
 struct: microsoft fault
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i got my work done in my class rn
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe some people just passed you or something in rank and pushed you down
 JHowell: No, my score went down 0.03.
 JHowell: I should have been using "score" instead of "rank" for most of my previous comments. I apologize.
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: xd
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh! A carthesian bear!
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: WHERE?!?!??!
 JLukeSkywalker: how many clashes have you done recently?
 BlaiseEbuth: The JHowell picture
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe it was a previous one updating score
 JLukeSkywalker: it only updates when the clash ends, maybe one was still open
 JHowell: I'm paranoid about my score, so I watch it change after the end of each clash. I haven't done any other clashes for days.
 BlaiseEbuth: Decay
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im drawing a pokemon now
 JHowell: BlaiseEbuth, I don't know what you mean by "picture".
 BlaiseEbuth: profile picture
 BlaiseEbuth: I was answering to eve
 JHowell: The decay should be applied every day, not after I play a clash, right?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: call me by my real name, kayla
 jacek: smits is on, but he doesnt chat... what happened to him :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: Right. But have you checked your score before this clash&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i hope it wasn't someone Blaise said&#160;;)
 jacek: robo fix your eval. 0.8 score before losing? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/579628004">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/579628004</a>
 JLukeSkywalker: also, in a 5 person clash, it mightbe correct that not winning brings score down
 JHowell: Yes, I go to the leaderboard before the clash, refresh after the clash ends, and compare the difference.
 BlaiseEbuth: Wontonimo&#160;?
 Wontonimo: the saying is "i hope it wasn't something i said", and I was just attempting to be funny.  :(
 Wontonimo: I'll try and find some online comedy classes and up my game
 BlaiseEbuth: Well, as JLukeSkywalker say, it's probably a TrueSkill issue JHowell...
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: like i said to every in discord "ok"
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't mind too much about little score variation though...
 RoboStac: yeah, the value loss for yava is staying quite high. It seems to be mostly be working though
 struct: robo starting to dominate everywhere&#160;:(
 struct: Maybe he will come to beat you on onitama next jacek
 RoboStac: I'd have to actually write a sim for that though
 RoboStac: instead of just rerunning old sims with all my latest changes
 struct: you didnt update breakthrough yet?
 RoboStac: was thinking of doing that or othello next
 jacek: :scream:
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i posted my art work on google classroom

 jacek: hm?
 struct: There was a multi where I got 15 matches vs him in 1 submit

 MSmits: are these self thingies PCR? 
 MSmits: not usre
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: I almost forgot what having a cold felt like, it's been 2 years

 Astrobytes: Depends on the variant. It's still put-you-in-hospital material even after vax
 MSmits: low chance of that though
 MSmits: most breakthrough infections are very mild even with delta
 MSmits: in fact the other variants barely even have breakthrough infections
 BlaiseEbuth: But connect-4 infections...
 Astrobytes: Delta results in more hospitalisations than first thought. Haven't checked the other variants.
 Astrobytes: yet
 MSmits: nah i am back to yavalath. Rebuilding my bot when not busy with work&#160;:)
 MSmits: Astrobytes arent they like 90% unvaccinated?
 Astrobytes: Isn't robo doing Yava too?
 MSmits: he always had a NN for yavalath. He just stopped at some point
 MSmits: might have picked up after Royales success
 MSmits: but it's all very RPS 
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Something like that yeah, but the hospital admission rate among the vaccinated (x2) is higher than expected
 MSmits: probably I could add 2 moves to my book and have 100% win, but my bot is annoying me, it can be better
 Astrobytes: I haven't looked tbh, not done anything on here for over a week
 MSmits: ahh ok, well i only recently started working on stuff again. Mostly just been running oware book generator
 MSmits: with the 36 seed endgame 
 MSmits: works reasonably well, can keep up with the weakest NN's at least
 Astrobytes: So low-mid top 10?
 MSmits: low top 10, can beat jolin dien and 1 or 2 others
 MSmits: but i havent actually used it for a NN yet, just to generate a book. 
 Astrobytes: I haven't even looked recently. I gave up on Oware.
 Astrobytes: For now.
 Astrobytes: How many NNs in there now?
 MSmits: well i do want to finally do that supervised learning thingy for it, but work got in the way. It's second on my list after beefing up Y
 MSmits: let me check
 MSmits: guessing 11
 MSmits: assuming tric never changed his bot
 MSmits: he was doing good before so...
 struct: hi msmits
 MSmits: hi struct
 struct: maybe I need to add a boss to it
 struct: since some players are playing it
 MSmits: can you do that without causing damage to the leaderboard?
 MSmits: wait, can you work on Y? 
 MSmits: did they give it back to you/
 struct: anyone can
 MSmits: ohh hok
 struct: I think all players resubmit
 struct: once they get promoted
 Astrobytes: Hok? Klingon? :P
 MSmits: as long as the game rules dont change that should not break anything
 MSmits: 	nuqDaq 'oH puchpa<i>e'?</i>
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: bIjatlh 'e' yImev 
 MSmits: ok&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: (I googled this, I cannot speak Klingon)
 MSmits: no :poop:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I thought that was a satisfactory response since it was Klingon though
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: man, colds really suck. Can't we just all go back into lockdown. I liked when they didn't happen
 Astrobytes: Once your immune system is used to them all again you'll be fine.
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, i remember times where i had them 6 times a year
 Astrobytes: I liked lockdown though, it was peaceful and quiet
 MSmits: especially early years as teacher
 Astrobytes: Yeah, kids are as bad as rats at spreading disease
 BlaiseEbuth: Hab SoSlI' Quch!
 MSmits: seems like BlaiseEbuth has one too
 Astrobytes: She does not!
 Astrobytes: (good one btw)
 Astrobytes: Alright, gn all, be on discord if you need me urgently
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 struct: gn
 MSmits: you sleep on discord?
 MSmits: that's troubling
 Astrobytes: I'm not going to sleep&#160;;)
 MSmits: ooo
 Astrobytes: if I go to sleep at 10:16 and I've not been up for 24+ hours, shoot me please
 struct: sleep is for the weak
 MSmits: sleep is for once a week
 SpectralFlame: lol, got multiple failed tests during a CoC but got a 100% for validation
 JimmyJams: it's not healthy to constantly seek validaiton
 wenhao3.yang: 干啥啥不行，吹牛第一名
 lvlingupirl: stupid question, how do you print in Go without submitting the answer, like console.error vs console.log in js?
 struct: fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "Debug messages...")
 lvlingupirl: thank you!
 Slyp: Python is OP in clash, please nerf
 Shamiko: I mean xD
 Bevan: LOL
 Slyp: :D
 JimmyJams: ruby more OP
 JimmyJams: beats bytecode cheaters even
 littlebevan: especially at the shortest mode
 elderlybeginner: &gt; Budding examiner&gt; Participate 3 times in the ranking of puzzle solutions.
 struct: I think its ranking other people solutions
 struct: but im not sure
 Westicles: It is on the results tab, learn from the best coders
 elderlybeginner: you mean upvoting puzzle solutions?
 Westicles: no, you have to click on that and do what it says
 Westicles: It prompts you to pick which of two solutions are better
 elderlybeginner: click on what? puzzle solution tab?
 ProCoder03: just solve a puzzle 100% 
 ProCoder03: and below the score, you will see learn from the best coders or something like that
 ProCoder03: they will ask for 3 reviews and review them. 
 elderlybeginner: oh, got it. It's inside the puzzle in the eiditor
 ProCoder03: not in the editor, in results tab...
 elderlybeginner: although I would like to choose: "None of these"
 elderlybeginner: yes, I found it, thanks
 Cack101:&#160;???

 Wontonimo: finally I can make community contributions that get more a lot more upvotes than down votes.  This feels like a milestone.
 struct: grats 
 Wontonimo: thanks&#160;!
 struct: not sure if I can trust my breathrough numbers
 Wontonimo: oh, what numbers are you getting?
 struct: out of 512x512 possible states, ignoring invalid ones
 struct: 258144 positions seem won after player that defended moved
 struct: so only 4k out of the 512^2 are defendable
 Wontonimo: 4K / 262k
 struct: I guess it makes sense because if you have 2 pieces on rank 7 its an auto win
 struct: so only there its 256*512
 eulerscheZahl: hi, still or already awake?
 Wontonimo: still
 struct: still
 Rizal87: hi
 DarkAstro: is it really bad to start with c++ as a first code language?
 Wontonimo: hey Rizal87, you look new.  welcome.  talk about coding or codingame. 
 struct: no
 struct: its the right choice
 DarkAstro: ok thanks
 Wontonimo: personally I really liked that one of my first languages that I learnt was C
 struct: can be frustrating though 
 struct: but not more frustrating than C
 Wontonimo: I didn't spend long in it, but it was a fantastic base.  I also did some assembly.  That was eye opening.
 DarkAstro: what did u do to learn ur language?
 DarkAstro: this website?
 Wontonimo: this website didn't existing in 1985, so no
 Wontonimo: i copied code from books
 Wontonimo: and made text adventure games
 struct: this websites is to improve your current skills
 Wontonimo: like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/HQ73Pjw">https://tech.io/snippet/HQ73Pjw</a>
 struct: you can also learn, but you will need a little bit of knowledge
 DarkAstro: oh so it's not beginner friendly 
 DarkAstro: any weebsite recs for me? 
 Wontonimo: well, I'm friendly.  But the challenges here are probably way too hard for someone with less than 1 month of experience
 eulerscheZahl: we have challenges?
 DarkAstro: i just need the fasts way to learn c++ to start develping my game
 Wontonimo: nope
 DarkAstro: fastest*
 Wontonimo: won't happen.  sorry.
 Wontonimo: two competing priorities
 Wontonimo: make game - learn c++.  Learning c++ well takes time and patience.  Making a game quickly is the opposite
 eulerscheZahl: for writing a game fast while till learning, c++ is probably one of the worst choices
 Wontonimo: chose one.  if you choose making a game quickly then use a drop-and-drag action game engine
 DarkAstro: idk what to do, i'm 18 n imma need money
 Wontonimo: well, making games IS NOT it.
 Wontonimo: the average pay for making a game is about $0.03 per hour
 eulerscheZahl: complicated language where you need an in-depth understanding. and popular frameworks like unity don't use c++
 Wontonimo: instead work on business programs
 Wontonimo: or websites
 DarkAstro: okay will do
 Wontonimo: working on automating data entry for a financial company pays in the range of $60k to $90k per year.  making games pays in the range of $100 to $900 per year
 eulerscheZahl: also money as a motivation to start coding, hmmit will take a while to get productive. you need passion to get there
 Wontonimo: ^^ exactly
 bennettj: if making games for fun, i think its best to learn by making games, as opposed to going and learning a language
 Wontonimo: you didn't learn to read in 1 month and you didn't learn all of your math knowledge in 1 month.  Programming is about as challenging as either of those
 eulerscheZahl: i started university 10 years ago. graduated, got a job. still learning. and lots of new technology popping up all the time
 eulerscheZahl: there is no such thing as mastering the field and then leaning back
 eulerscheZahl: except when you maintain old Cobol systems :thinking:
 DarkAstro: I see, ig i'll spend one hour of learning code and just take it slow and continue Video Editing  
 DarkAstro: i also want to learn 3d and 2d animation 
 struct: I just woke up and knew programming 
 struct: it was easy
 eulerscheZahl: you can totally try to get into coding and build a game. just telling that c++ isn't the easiest way to get into it
 DarkAstro: but i want to use unreal engine 
 eulerscheZahl: have a look at unity and c# if you want to see fast results that give you a rewarding feeling to keep going
 struct: im not sure how beginner frinedly UE is
 eulerscheZahl: ok, for unreal engine c++ is the right choice
 struct: and making a game before knowing the basics seem a recipe for disaster 
 eulerscheZahl: ^
 eulerscheZahl: set yourself goals that challenge you but are realistic
 DarkAstro: okay, got it... i just wish i started coding earlier when i had more time 
 struct: Well its not late
 eulerscheZahl: and entering is easier than it used to be just 10 years ago. lots of resources to start with
 DarkAstro: well do you guys have any fun game like  websites/apps like this beginner friendly. If not just give me a link how'd you guys learned and i'll start there  
 DarkAstro: like this but beginner friendly*
 Wontonimo: unity3d has a bunch of beginner tutorials for C# 
 Wontonimo: but by beginner, what is mean is having at least some prior programming experience
 Killer_Kat: Just do it man, I learnt a bunch of C# and made a nice game in unity. I never published it but I learned a lot and it was very fun and rewarding
 Killer_Kat: Its going to be difficult at times no matter where you start but if you stick with it thats the important part
 LazyfromDiscord: hilleooi

 ZXC01: or use command /join clash
 Flowersquare: how can I get a chance to get a parttime job by playing coding games?
 Flowersquare: I know only python for  now
 ZXC01: press 'get a job'
 Flowersquare: that seems to be a fulltime job webpage
 ZXC01: hmm i think both is included
 Flowersquare: oh let me check again
 ZXC01: when a company contacts you you just say you wants a part time job
 Wontonimo: no one wants to hire a part time programmer imho
 ZXC01: lol
 ZXC01: btw most programer knows more than one language
 Wontonimo: it just doesn't really make business sense to have a part time programmer.  Your effectiveness is a function of how well you know the system, and how well you know the system is a function of how much time you send on it.  Part time means partly effective
 Flowersquare: emmmm I was thinking I can make some script with python and sell it for coins...
 ZXC01: lol
 ZXC01: start an website then
 Flowersquare: do you mean "build a website"?
 Wontonimo: I am a recovering entrepreneur.  My new mission in life is to dash the dreams of would be entrepreneur with the harsh realities of 'striking out on your own'.  Just get a job.
 Wontonimo: It pays way more, has much better benefits, is dependable, and the banks will treat you 100x better for being part of mainstream society
 Flowersquare: I got a child to look after. I can't be full-timed...
 Wontonimo: that's a tough situation

 Flowersquare: I should have one before
 Flowersquare: oh I need to set vpn to use discord...

 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: Have anyone here heard about Dijkstra's Algorithm?
 C26_1: Its infamous right?
 C26_1: So I'm gonna test it in a map

 C26_1: I don't know if this mission will success
 C26_1: Ok
 C26_1: So as I say
 C26_1: Dijkstra's Algo is very fast
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the size of the map
 C26_1: Ok
 eulerscheZahl: use A* if you need a more directed search and can estimate how far you are away from the target
 eulerscheZahl: "ye, you have to use vpn because Codingame uses Google services which are blocked in China"
 eulerscheZahl: wondering if new Chinese users can even register now..
 eulerscheZahl: as we have the captcha on login now
 NotANick: is php compiler in here kinda broken?
 eulerscheZahl: is PHP compiled?
 NotANick: kinda?
 NotANick: because it is compiling when you are send the request and sens you compiled one.
 NotANick: sends you*
 eulerscheZahl: i see. somehow i thought it was interpreted
 Wontonimo: i thought it was interpreted most of the time but does hot compiling as it sees fit for tight loops, much like java does
 eulerscheZahl: java compiles to bytecode before, can you still call this interpreted?
 Wontonimo: but for tight loops it compiles the bytecode to assembly
 Wontonimo: and runs compiled on metal
 ZXC01: lol moderators debating

 C26_1: @ducuuuuu, you don't need to share link at this public chat
 Uljahn: ^ this chat is for discussions. not for spamming invites
 Uljahn: use #clash channel for that (type /join clash)
 C26_1: @all
 C26_1: I found a way to distinct between interpreter and compiler
 C26_1: Interpreter doing its work by repeating this procedure:- Check if the next line of code is right and no syntax error
 C26_1: - If that line of code has no syntax error then it translate that code into 1 or more than 1 line of machine code
 C26_1: - Do the machine code that has been translated
 C26_1: Compiler is different though
 C26_1: Compiler:- Check all line of code if there is at least one of them has syntax error- If there is no syntax error, translate all line of code into machine code but don't run it yet, and that file will be use whenever we want to use it
 C26_1: @Uljahn, have any idea?
 Uljahn: don't ping me pls
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: sorry
 CreeZzoo: someone can help me?
 AntiSquid: what is your follow up question?
 CreeZzoo: about loop
 AntiSquid: hmm i need a set of pliers to pull the actual question out of you&#160;?
 CreeZzoo: question mad pod racing
 C26_1: There is two kind of loops:- The first one is variables that use to keep track how some code will be repeated lots of time- The second one is variables that like the first one AND use in calculation
 C26_1: So be careful when your program has a lot of loops
 C26_1: Um
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 can teach you how to listen to your heart and ask what you truly want to ask
 Automaton2000: i was using the wrong language
 C26_1: Is there a way to delete a variable in some programming language?
 C26_1: Like C, C++?
 eulerscheZahl: let it go out of scope?

 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: So there are 2 ways to delete a variable:
 C26_1: clear(&lt;variable name&gt;)
 AntiSquid: how old are you c26_1&#160;?
 C26_1: I'm 13
 C26_1: But that doesn't mean kids cannon learn programming language
 AntiSquid: oh ok you have until the age of 38 to become the next mcsmitz

 Wontonimo: you missed checkpoint 3
 Wontonimo: yikes, and orbited around it
 DialFrost: mhm
 DialFrost: the dumb boost
 DialFrost: lol
 Wontonimo: so, when you are close to a checkpoint you could slow down so you don't overshoot
 Wontonimo: same with boosting.  only boost when far from a checkpoint and aiming pretty much at it
 DialFrost: the thing is idk when to boos
 Wontonimo: implement that and i'll give you some better hints
 DialFrost: boost*
 Wontonimo: don't need boost until gold
 DialFrost: wait wattttttttttttttttt
 Wontonimo: but if you want, a lot of people use it when facing a checkpoint and far
 DialFrost: hm okey thx
 Wontonimo: go as fast as you can, but no faster.  i guess that second part is just as important as the first
 Wontonimo: also, read this&#160;! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>  It will make your bot nearly unstoppable
 Thorcode: WOnton, do you have any advise to use boost, I got distance of checkpoints.
 Wontonimo: when farr distance &gt; 4000 and pointing at it  abs(angle) &lt; 10 then boost
 Wontonimo: but you
 Wontonimo: but you are already in high gold
 Thorcode: nah in gold have no angle
 Thorcode: my bot pretty stupid in boosting and drifting
 Wontonimo: you do have angle
 Thorcode: it is my pod angle
 Thorcode: not checkpoint

 Wontonimo: yes, i do
 Precision59: can u pls help me lol
 Wontonimo: how far are you?  have you figured out that you need to aim at X,Y instead of Y,Y&#160;?
 Precision59: omg
 Precision59: i didnt see that lol
 Precision59: ive been sitting here for ages like everythings correct
 Precision59: thanks
 Wontonimo: step 1 - read instructions which tell you that there is an error on that line
 Wontonimo: step 2 - increase thrust to 100
 Precision59: do i make a thrust variable?
 Mortis_666: mad pod racing not so fun
 Wontonimo: not yet.  set it to 100 
 Precision59: where though
 Wontonimo: in the code
 Wontonimo: on the same line as the x and y are set
 Precision59: yea but where in the code
 Precision59: ohh
 Precision59: ok
 Wontonimo: i mean printed
 Wontonimo: hey Mortis_666 , if you can make your pod slow down when it is close to a checkpoint, it will help a lot
 Wontonimo: like maybethrust = 100 if distance &gt; 1200 else 50
 Wontonimo: you'll have to calculate distance
 Precision59: theres no thrust var
 Wontonimo: make one
 Mortis_666: idk i dont understand this game so much
 Wontonimo: are you a programmer or a ... something else
 Precision59: u just said not to lol ill make one ahah
 Wontonimo: i was talking to Mortis_666
 Mortis_666: abd how u make red text
 Wontonimo: yoiu don't need it hyet
 Precision59: ohhh
 Wontonimo: just put the persons name in the text
 Wontonimo: this is without your name
 Mortis_666: ok
 Wontonimo: this is Mortis_666
 Mortis_666: nais
 Wontonimo: no "@" needed

 Aaronnotsharon: can someone help me with the horse-racing duels? My coding "is not optimized enought to handle some cases" and idk how to make it more optimized
 Thorcode: lang?
 Aaronnotsharon: c++
 Wontonimo: what is the concept behind yourr current solution?
 Thorcode: I think I can't
 Wontonimo: Dont Paste Your Solution&#160;!
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: I won't paste it
 Wontonimo: but explain the concept plx Aaronnotsharon
 Thorcode: bruh my solution publish alot
 Aaronnotsharon: I'm using a pointer to fill my array and then I am using nested for loops to process the information. The one it can't process has something like 10000 different horses to process.
 Thorcode: make a var like n =100000
 Aaronnotsharon: well thats not the problem, I think its taking too long to process the info...
 Mortis_666: Why there is no save draft button when making a contribution
 Aaronnotsharon: FailureProcess has timed out. This may mean that your solution is not optimized enough to handle some cases.
 Aaronnotsharon: thats exactly what it is saying when it failes
 Thorcode: which case?
 Wontonimo: there is Mortis_666
 Mortis_666: Where?
 Wontonimo: save it as private
 Aaronnotsharon: only the "Many horses" case. has that failure. all the other ones are passing. the Many Horses has 10000 horses though, while the others have like 10
 Thorcode: use list?
 Wontonimo: so, the problem is definitely that your solution will take way too long
 Mortis_666: O thx so much!!!
 Wontonimo: can you think of a faster way of checking 2 horses
 Thorcode: list
 Thorcode: is fastest I think
 Aaronnotsharon: yea.. and i thought list you can only have what is either at the top for stack or what is at the front or back for queue. 
 Thorcode: use sort
 Aaronnotsharon: oh, i didnt know there is a sort function. thanks i'll try using that. 
 Thorcode: even though I don't know if c++ have sort
 Thorcode: ah yes It have

 Thorcode:  "_" not help me sort easier
 Wontonimo: yeah, i don't sort by name
 Wontonimo: i have a function that reads a line of items for sale and returns a dictionary containing damage, health, mana, etc

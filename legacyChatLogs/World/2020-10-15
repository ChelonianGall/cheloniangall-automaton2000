 Laminator: He keeps his secrets. Hence never sharing his code
 ImaNoob: bruh
 ImaNoob: bghtmd,
 Harrogin: i feel like everyone who codes in Ruby comes up with crazy elegant solutions really fast
 ImaNoob: ok
 Laminator: They have access to more tools
 ImaNoob: But which is the best way to learn ruby
 Ugu_Ugu: University
 ImaNoob: university?
 Ugu_Ugu: yes~
 ImaNoob: ok
 ImaNoob: University is a website?
 Ugu_Ugu: if u study hard, you can reach there
 ImaNoob: ok
 ImaNoob: ima learn on oy youtube
 ImaNoob: and maybe i'll learn c++ too
 Ugu_Ugu: good job
 ImaNoob: ok
 ImaNoob: it's seem like python is easy for me so i'll use Pyton
 ImaNoob: :money_mouth:

 LinhT.Nguyen: please guys enough with the accusations. it's about learning and improving not cheating 
 Uljahn: there is no learning and improving in being fed with the answers
 KiwiTae: ooh Uljahn o/ 
 Uljahn: hihi Kiwo
 MSmits: it's kiwi, look at the avatar. Its the fruit!
 MSmits: and it's also a bird
 MSmits: KiwiTae I am fascinated by your avatar
 Einwickler: It's a visual teapot
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493152117">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493152117</a>
 MSmits: look what my dude does at the end
 MSmits: it's a real problem with solving games. He's like, screw it -&gt; Geronimooooo,
 MSmits: this game I solved at ply 10.
 MSmits: (as a loss)
 Einwickler: Oh dear. But you would have been losing at that point anyway right?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: 3 moves left, last being my opponents, so it was a lost cause
 Einwickler: So it's kind of a neat feature to shorten the replays&#160;;)
 MSmits: problem is, i solve much earlier
 MSmits: i know at ply 10 I have lost
 MSmits: so what move to do? If everything is a loss
 MSmits: frame 10 sry, that's ply 9 i guess
 Einwickler: Take the worst move available to shorten the replay? Dunno :thinking:
 MSmits: that would be a bad idea. The thing is, my opponent doesn't know he has won
 MSmits: so he might still make a mistake
 MSmits: so i should still do the best move. At the end it doesn't really matter, as my opponent surely knows, but at ply 9 it really does
 Einwickler: Ah yes of course. :joy:
 MSmits: so what I do know, because it's mcts, I take the move with the most visits
 MSmits: which is likely the best move and if not, at least the one hardest to solve and giving the longest game
 Einwickler: Whats the mieaning of visits in this context?
 MSmits: it keeps growing the tree by making simulations from a leaf of the tree
 MSmits: preferring better branches of course
 MSmits: as opposed to minimax, which just does all branches to equal depth
 Einwickler: So its minimax with a brain?&#160;:)
 MSmits: mmh i guess so, it's a bit more involved yeah
 MSmits: it's used in uttt as well
 MSmits: but people do ok with minimax
 MSmits: top 10 is probably all mcts, below that minimax gets more common as you go down
 MSmits: in some games minimax works better
 MSmits: but you should learn minimax before mcts
 Einwickler: I still didnt do the minimax implementation for uttt. Im kinda stuck with the idea of finally doing things in c++ in favor of the languages im comfortable with because they kinda suck in performance
 MSmits: mmh i wouldnt start with C++
 MSmits: I did my first UTTT in C#
 Einwickler: And Im reaaally slow in doing things in c
 Einwickler: *c++
 MSmits: then converted to C++ in 2 days, having never coded anything in c++ before that
 MSmits: (1000 lines!)
 MSmits: so conversion is doable
 Einwickler: Yeah I had some C in my classes but the prof was kinda bad so I didnt really learned that much
 Einwickler: Since then i am avoiding this subject of low level like languages :D
 MSmits: same, i think i had a very short class, with no explanations, just muddle along on your own, i copied what my fellow students did. This was 20 yrs ago
 MSmits: this was in the context of coding for physics
 MSmits: we were supposed to solve the schrodinger equation for an infinite well using c
 Einwickler: This is so sad. We had a really good class using ruby and I learned a lot about it. But I would exchange that knowledge for finally being able to properly code in c++ at any time
 MSmits: you need to know very little c++ to effectively code for boardgames on CG
 Einwickler: My biggest problem for the basic stuff actually is handling collections
 MSmits: mostly it is learning about pointers and memory, forward declaration and such
 MSmits: ahh, well the thing is. Once you are optimizing for a boardgame, you use the collection types less and less
 Einwickler: It's so convenient in high level languages
 MSmits: until in the end, you're just using giant arrays
 MSmits: you dont realize though, with the higher languages, how slow your fancy collection types are
 Einwickler: But arrays are of static size? So you just declare them with a huge size at the beginning?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: Node nodes[NODE_MAX];
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 MSmits: (thats a lotta nodes)
 Einwickler: Oh boy, that doesn't really sound more performant to me but I guess it is?
 MSmits: the thing that makes it performant is that you dont need to create new objects during run time
 MSmits: they're there
 MSmits: you're just using them
 MSmits: and creating a new object is just incrementing an index to the array
 MSmits: nodeIndex++
 Einwickler: Ah yeah sure because in board games you only care about performance/run time per move right?
 MSmits: yeah pretty much
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: if you do minimax
 MSmits: evaluation of the board is super important
 MSmits: but if you take that as a given, the next step would be performance
 Einwickler: Yes but I mean you can do the setup of your huge arrays at the start and then just reuse them?
 MSmits: minimax doesnt use a node array though
 MSmits: you dont store your nodes
 MSmits: this is a mcts thing
 MSmits: well technically you can store them, but you dont need to
 MSmits: minimax doesnt use memory at all 
 MSmits: well.. a negligible amount
 Einwickler: But you still store your board state at least once at any given time
 MSmits: yeah just that
 MSmits: do / undo moves
 MSmits: mcts keeps statistics
 MSmits: so you need lots of memory
 Einwickler: But for a 3x3 board thats really to be ignored I guess :D
 MSmits: for any size really
 MSmits: a 9x9 board is still very small
 Einwickler: sure
 MSmits: in mcts the board size matters
 MSmits: because if the board size is small, you can save it on the node
 MSmits: and then you dont need to do/undo moves when moving through the tree
 MSmits: since the boards are already fully on the nodes
 programistination: Hello
 programistination: Mr Physics
 MSmits: hi
 Einwickler: Don't want to deep dive into this at this point but what is the point of storing the board states in the nodes in mcts? Or did I get this wrong? Whats wrong with just storing its rating if thats all you care about?
 Einwickler: Just tell me if thats a question you would have to go deep into it
 MSmits: oh, well, when you go down the tree, you modify your board, by applying the move that goes with the node
 MSmits: sometimes applying a move, is a complicated thing that takes time
 Einwickler: Dont want to get confused before I even started with minimax :D
 MSmits: if the next boardstate is already on the node, you dont have to apply the move
 MSmits: since you already have the result of it
 Einwickler: Ah so its kind of trading memory against computing time for next depth?
 MSmits: generally, if a boardstate is 128 bit or smaller, i keep it on the node
 MSmits: exactly
 Einwickler: Got it
 Einwickler: Makes sense
 programistination: mr Physics what are Differentiel equations used for in physics
 MSmits: for coming up with new formula's using the physical constraints that come with the situation you're looking at
 MSmits: basically, everywhere in physics
 MSmits: it's the most important math 
 programistination: I did them in math last year
 MSmits: for example waves, waves are everywhere
 programistination: linear , bernoulli , homogenoeus
 MSmits: the second derivative of the function is equal to minus that function
 MSmits: that gives a wave
 programistination: interesting
 MSmits: well add some constants
 MSmits: remove the minus
 MSmits: and you have an exponential
 MSmits: waves are everywhere in physics
 MSmits: exponentials also
 MSmits: i dont remember all the ways of solving them as we stop just short of this in my physics classes
 programistination: but when you study them in math classes
 programistination: it's bs
 programistination: you just solving some equations
 programistination: and you don't know nothing about the physical aspect of it xD
 programistination: idk
 MSmits: thats annoying about math yes
 MSmits: and why i didnt like it when i was younger
 programistination: well there are two types of ppl
 programistination: there are the ones who can't study something that can't be experienced or touched 
 programistination: and there is the opposite
 Einwickler: But It's really dependent of the teacher you got too
 MSmits: well I am somewhere in between. Usually i didn't matter that much, but often in the math classes i did, they went really really abstract
 programistination: yep it's kinda boring , when you can't relate it to something in the real word
 programistination: world*
 MSmits: they would be talking about matrices A and B and then someone would ask for an example
 MSmits: then the professor would say
 MSmits: well for example take this matrix:
 MSmits: a,b,cd,e,fg,h,i
 MSmits: etc.
 MSmits: You get the idea
 programistination: lol
 programistination: yeah
 programistination: abstract vs concrete
 Einwickler: My girlfriend just asked me what I did the whole day before I knew this site
 TheManeatingPonyVanDerSwag_d59d: Hi all
 Einwickler: I dont know anymore :D
 Einwickler: HI :wave:
 MSmits: it's a good question though
 sunksuperset370: hi
 Einwickler: MSmits do you know "Selected Papers on Fun and Games" by Don Knuth? Seems to be a book made just for you&#160;:)
 sunksuperset370: hey ellis
 sunksuperset370: allis
 Allis: Oh, hi.
 sunksuperset370: sorry long time no see
 Allis: No worries.
 A.F: hi
 sunksuperset370: i code during class
 Allis: As is only right and proper.
 sunksuperset370: no i am in science right now
 A.F: how to pass CODERS STRIKE BACK
 A.F:&#160;?
 A.F: help me please
 A.F: :sob:
 Uljahn: how may I help you?
 sunksuperset370: problem i just rage quit that puzzle
 sunksuperset370: i hate the collision part
 sunksuperset370: sorry it was just too much for javascript on me
 sunksuperset370: any one want to join my clash
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: hello?
 sunksuperset370: any one want to join my clash of code
 sunksuperset370: hey allis
 sunksuperset370: any one else?
 Allis: Are you streaming?
 sunksuperset370: noo
 sunksuperset370: nonono
 sunksuperset370: i am just in class feeling lonely
 sunksuperset370: plus i am not a streamer
 sunksuperset370: i am on a chromeboo
 sunksuperset370: chromebook
 sunksuperset370: i am just asking people on codingame to joining me
 Allis: Makes sense.
 sunksuperset370: 10 sec
 Allis: Probably best to do so in the #clash channel in future.
 LastRick: or share a link?
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i will
 sunksuperset370: after this clash
 MSmits: Einwickler will check it out
 sunksuperset370: hold on
 sunksuperset370: i will finish this clash then i will put the link in the chat bin
 Astrobytes: sunksuperset370: asking for participants in world chat is cool, but post links in #clash as Allis said or in PM
 sunksuperset370: ok thx
 sunksuperset370: i think i am really bad at this clash
 sunksuperset370: i just quit for this one
 sunksuperset370: the link is in the #clash
 sunksuperset370: please join
 sunksuperset370: thx
 sunksuperset370: hello
 sunksuperset370: please join my clash in #clash
 Astrobytes: (and don't spam it, people can still see your original request)
 sunksuperset370: oh sorry
 jacek:  Oo
 jacek: hmm, how come d&amp;b has more players than onitama, despite being much newer? :thinking: :eyes:
 MSmits: onitama is an acquired taste
 jacek: so d&amp;b is for plebs
 MSmits: sure
 Marchete: agree
 jacek: is there some intrinistic for getting list of indexes of bits of integer?
 Marchete: yes
 jacek: like 0b10001 = {0,4}
 jacek: for now i have good old loop
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0be7bb9e-2afe-464f-b3eb-55e0e786758f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0be7bb9e-2afe-464f-b3eb-55e0e786758f</a>
 jacek: :s
 Marchete: it's so ugly it broke the pastebin
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/3BUjncqv">https://pastebin.com/3BUjncqv</a>
 Illedan: Hi Marchete. Long time. Zup?
 Marchete: I can't see pastebin but I imagine 1ULL&lt;&lt;index
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: doing pleb games
 Illedan: pleb?
 Marchete: for pleb people
 Illedan: Never heard the word pleb before :P 
 jacek: so nobel
 jacek: noble even
 Marchete: plebeian
 Illedan: aha
 Marchete: intrinsic for loop of bitsets is with  
 Marchete: count_zeroes_right == __builtin_ctzll == _BitScanForward64(&amp;idx, x); in Windows
 jacek: thats plebeian system
 Marchete: I have some macro for loops
 Marchete: a First() then a Next(I)
 Marchete: Next takes the last index as parameter
 Marchete: #define BOXLOOP(i,bLOOP)  (int i = (bLOOP).First(); i &gt;=0; i = (bLOOP).Next(i) )
 jacek: is it much faster?
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: others use a while(){}
 Marchete: but in that case you need to remember to do stuff inside the while loop
 Marchete: I picked the approach "for BOXLOOP(i, values){}"
 Marchete: anyways Msmits_ is the master bitmasker here
 MSmits: hi
 MSmits: lemme reread your problem jacek
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: lemme give you a code example i use for this. Have to look through a bot or two, i do this a lot
 MSmits: I am guessing uttt
 jacek: checkers
 MSmits: also yeah, sec
 jacek: but probably also othello
 MSmits: this is how i do it in uttt apparently:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.pl/view/316093c6">https://pastebin.pl/view/316093c6</a>
 MSmits: but i do it differently in other games
 MSmits: probably better to get the index first, then do 1ULL &lt;&lt; index to get the bit to remove
 MSmits: instead of doing moves &amp; -moves
 jacek: pastebin.pl?
 MSmits: no idea, it was the first thing that came up on google :P
 MSmits: dunno why
 jacek: uint16? its for uttt?
 MSmits: this is with a ternary bitboard
 MSmits: kind of
 jacek: so its triboard
 MSmits: not entirely, the moves are binary
 MSmits: the board is ternary
 MSmits: so i pick the moves with this system off a uint16_t
 MSmits: then apply the move to tritboard
 jacek: ah so its looped __builtin_ctz. i thought it would be something more fancy
 MSmits: if that i exists, i dont know it
 jacek: so it doesnt exist then
 MSmits: well fancy builtin stuff usually doesnt return lists
 MSmits: at most it's an integer or an array fitting in a simd register or something
 zapakh: How do I disable the autocomplete box in the IDE?
 eulerscheZahl: jacek 02:40PMhmm, how come d&amp;b has more players than onitama, despite being much newer? :thinking: :eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: and how did it get a straight 5 star rating? :o
 eulerscheZahl: 27 votes, all 5 stars. not a single hater yet
 Marchete: because it's a nice puzzle
 Marchete: no weird rules
 Marchete: just a single move type
 MSmits: it is, but it's not art, like Onitama&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but i thought every game gets a 1 star troll at that point
 MSmits: did you rate it yet?
 eulerscheZahl: i never rate
 eulerscheZahl: neither mine nor others
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: I rate everything 5 stars :p
 eulerscheZahl: i upvote on the contrib page
 MSmits: but whats this about stuff getting removed with too many negative votes, is this real?
 MSmits: ratings i mean
 eulerscheZahl: yes. i think you need 20 votes in total and a low average
 MSmits: I see
 jacek: challenge accepted
 Westicles: Has anyone looked at how many 2048 tests can get the 131k tile?  It looks like 14/30 to me
 eulerscheZahl: 0 for me. but i'm not a reliable source here
 Westicles: I mean in theory.  I know that is the upper limit based on the spawns, but might be lower
 MSmits: hey Westicles, do you also do bot programming or just optims?
 Westicles: You gotta spawn a 4 at the right time, and have no 2s around
 Westicles: Never tried the bots.  I'm not much good at writing tight fast code
 MSmits: you may not have to be if you're this good at writing smart search algo's
 jacek: 2048 has 2 1 starts
 eulerscheZahl: you don't become a puzzle of the week like that
 eulerscheZahl: shame on you 2048
 MSmits: who does that
 MSmits: seriously
 eulerscheZahl: i script. and i'd really like to know how it works
 eulerscheZahl: a script*
 MSmits: did you say something snarky and they 1 starred you?
 eulerscheZahl: or one didn't like the game, no idea
 eulerscheZahl: votes are anonymous
 MSmits: makes no sense, everyone knows what the game is before starting
 MSmits: it's 2048
 eulerscheZahl: you can know and hate it at the same time
 MSmits: yeah but then just dont start :P
 eulerscheZahl: then maybe i got a hater, who knows
 MSmits: I'm surprised you're still nr 1 btw. You're not actively working on keeping that rank and royale seemd to be
 jacek: :innocent:
 MSmits: would have expected him to pass you by now
 eulerscheZahl: onitama gained popularity so i climbed back up
 eulerscheZahl: he was above me
 MSmits: oh, you got boosted
 eulerscheZahl: and i did the teccles opening for UTTT :D
 MSmits: haha!
 MSmits: good man
 jacek: did you go up then?
 eulerscheZahl: from 140 to 100 approx
 MSmits: it's one of the nice heuristics that actually works well
 MSmits: though not 100%,you can lose by applying it, I've seen cases
 MSmits: kar liso once told me his bot is 3k+ lines
 MSmits: mine is big at 1k
 MSmits: I can't imagine what fancy heuristics are in there. 
 eulerscheZahl: in my ranking range it's a boost for sure
 MSmits: yeah, my bot even uses it still
 jacek: it even me god boosted by acout 10 ranks
 MSmits: in all cases
 jacek: tttt
 jacek: i cant type today
 MSmits: teccles tic tac toe?
 MSmits: btw you can also do the teccles within the search
 MSmits: not just for picking the move
 MSmits: you can get much deeper that way
 jacek: i only use it in the opening
 eulerscheZahl: no i can't. would require refactoring
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: i have a few pruning rules that are not 100% guaranteed, so my search tree resets a lotr
 MSmits: because my opponent does a move i didnt search
 MSmits: like teccles, if he doesnt do teccles, my search tree is gone
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have that problem. i don't reuse my tree :D
 MSmits: ahh, yeah, well i end up not reusing it much either this way
 eulerscheZahl: do you see a way to expand a node without listing all possible next moves first and then picking one?
 eulerscheZahl: to allocate memory for all children right away
 jacek: nah i always expand by every children
 MSmits: yeah i do too
 eulerscheZahl: ok, then i waste time somewhere else
 jacek: actually i cant imagine one node at a time, like in early mcts go literature
 MSmits: a small bias toward avoiding moves that give your opponent a free move, helps
 MSmits: in selection i mean
 jacek: or adding bonus for moves that win small board
 MSmits: because these moves are generally very bad and also cause lots of branching
 MSmits: yeah supposedly that works, i have not been able to see much difference though
 MSmits: might depend on the rest of the bot
 eulerscheZahl: nah, not going back to it. i'd rather give 2048 a more serious shot
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl once you have all the basic stuff done, most gains will be gotten from optimizing the random rollout
 MSmits: and that's not fun for you
 eulerscheZahl: you know me
 _Royale: MSmits: eulerscheZahl: I will probably start Onitama soon&#160;:)
 MSmits: that's cool _Royale&#160;:)
 MSmits: you'll like it
 MSmits: beware bugs with card rotation and such, you can get stuck a little bit
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, rip #1
 MSmits: there's always yavalath&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :poop:
 MSmits: hey it's fun&#160;:)
 MSmits: FB probably has room for improvement for you eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: if you were looking for cp
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: or golfing
 MSmits: vindinium too
 MSmits: your own game :P
 MSmits: you can do better than 26 for sure
 eulerscheZahl: 25?
 MSmits: i dunno , but you lack 1500 cp there, so a few ranks help a ton
 Westicles: golfing is fun.  love those vb.net and pascal system calls
 eulerscheZahl: i had vindinium on my TODO for ages. back when it was still hosted on vindinium.org
 eulerscheZahl: then suddenly it was offline so i decided to port and play on CG
 eulerscheZahl: still on my TODO&#160;:(
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i should go back and give that a try
 MSmits: now that i am better at the whole minimax thing
 eulerscheZahl: or GitC
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: i never got the hang of that
 eulerscheZahl: i remember your struggle
 Illedan: One of the prettiest games though
 MSmits: i love that part of it yeah
 eulerscheZahl: codebusters and hypersonic have the best graphics IMO
 MSmits: it's really one of those games that makes you think, wow that's great. And then when you start: umm now what?
 MSmits: they look cool yeah
 MSmits: wow i am 2nd in HS!
 MSmits: oh it's yurkovas
 Westicles: Hey Illedan, I'm having to turn my snake different directions per test case for 2048.  Did you have that problem?
 MSmits: he was asking me questions the other day, i guess he boosted me
 Illedan: I have code for it yeah
 Illedan: but I lost motivation at that point
 Illedan: But I didn't need it for that score
 MSmits: 'turning the snake" is 2048 jargon?
 Illedan: ye
 wlesavo: ru chat is all about 2048  :slight_smile:
 Illedan: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: i was stalking you Russians a bit
 Westicles: Do the russians agree with me that only 14 of the test cases can possibly get the 131k tile?
 eulerscheZahl: validators are public. and the same as the visible testcases
 wlesavo: Westicles yes, and only 4 for 131 + 65
 Westicles: oh, I didn't get that far.  only have 3 131k so far
 wlesavo: quite nice distribution actually, i wonder if it was meant to be this way
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Euler at 10 mill be like. Yeah, 100&#160;% planned
 eulerscheZahl: definitely planned that way :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/rb4qLL4">https://tech.io/snippet/rb4qLL4</a>
 Illedan: Seed generator?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: RNG from project euler, repeats only after 6 million random numbers
 eulerscheZahl: "random"
 wlesavo: :smiley: well anyway dbdr should be very close to optimum
 sDCrAZzE: ELMOP
 sDCrAZzE: es delanka po feef rejup
 sDCrAZzE: poof de fuef le jeje
 eulerscheZahl: 6308949 numbers in the cycle to be exact
 wlesavo: cycles of 80k would be ok :slight_smile:
 Westicles: I was really surprised you can get 50M using only 3 dirs
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: Helps to know where numbers spawn
 dbdr: oh, russian speakers are squatting the top 5
 Illedan: I keep only 3 dirs until a certain point to get more simulations
 Illedan: And I count the number of that last dir. It never goes above 5 in total
 Illedan: Meaning I can just disable it under certain conditions
 eulerscheZahl: i would give them a friendly hi but all i know is "cyka blat"
 Illedan: :P
 wlesavo: this will count
 dbdr: and #8 has 54M :D
 eulerscheZahl: and then: nothing
 Illedan: Was nicer 1 week ago when I was chilling here alone :P
 dbdr: Illedan is a sprinter
 Illedan: Always
 eulerscheZahl: and then he gets a cramp
 Illedan: Did a few marathons though :P
 dbdr: 2km marathons?&#160;;)
 Illedan: 42km, but best is only 4 hours :P
 eulerscheZahl: marathons in real life? wow
 dbdr: sounds pretty good already
 Ferreato: hy
 Illedan: Sure did 2. And 2 months ago I did a half-marathon in the mountains
 Ferreato: i'm new here
 eulerscheZahl: i need a ball to motivate me to run
 Astrobytes: "Fetch euler!"
 eulerscheZahl: woof
 Astrobytes: "good boy"

 Einwickler: Good evening (or whatever it is in your tz) :wave:
 KiwiTae: Einwickler o/
 Einwickler: Kiwi *nod*
 Einwickler: I dont like this emoticon KiwiTae. As a german this angled raised arm has a really bad taste to it :fearful:
 MSmits: I agree, everyone but Germans should use it :P
 KiwiTae: o/&lt;3 better? 
 Astrobytes: If you look at it the other way, it's actually the other arm
 KiwiTae: haha
 Einwickler: So we are checking who is german and who isn't again? I dont think thats a good idea too :joy:
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: we already know that anyways
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even allowed to declare my stringstream ss
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 KiwiTae: tough
 Hjax: hello everyone ^_^
 KiwiTae: and im forbidden to use c++
 Astrobytes: hey Hjax, where you been hiding
 Einwickler: oh boy this conversation really went sideways fast :D
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.facebook.com/thedailyshow/videos/an-amusement-parks-accidental-swastika-ride/378869629388741/">https://www.facebook.com/thedailyshow/videos/an-amusement-parks-accidental-swastika-ride/378869629388741/</a>  this is one of the funniest mistakes ever
 Einwickler: Cheers Hjax :wave:
 KiwiTae: ah no my bad lol failed
 Hjax: ive been pretty lazy, havent really started a code of ice and fire yet 
 echossouth: Sup everyone
 Astrobytes: I don't want to click the link MSmits but I remember that story
 Hjax: i read the post mortems and understand how the game works i think 
 Astrobytes: Nerchio got legend Hjax, now you must
 MSmits: yeah, i can't believe noone thought of this&#160;:)
 Einwickler: MSmits yeah I know this one :D
 Hjax: nerchio has been working hard
 Astrobytes: He has indeed

 MSmits: hey guys, does anyone know how to use a random seed from all positions in cg benchmark?
 Hjax: so the game, as i understand it, is about cutting off your opponents income and preventing your opponent from doing the same 
 Hjax: the fact that you can make a big path of soldiers in a single turn is pretty unique 
 Einwickler: eulerscheZahl ohhh dear :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: took me years to notice :D
 MSmits: Hjax how do you mean unique?
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair the floor is way older than 1930
 Hjax: you can spawn a soldier next to the soldier you placed on this turn 
 Astrobytes: wow, oh no :D
 Hjax: ive never seen a game like that before 
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: it's a pretty cool part of the game though
 MSmits: it's not just used to finish the game either
 eulerscheZahl: chain kills were a bit too powerful IMO
 MSmits: you can also use it to cut off territory
 Hjax: yeah its used for those big territory cuts people do 
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: The whole game was cool, but yeah the chain kill meta was a bit annoying
 eulerscheZahl: still among my favorites
 MSmits: it puts a timer on the game, I like it
 MSmits: if you let your opponent amass too much gold, you're dead
 Hjax: it does look fun, i expect to find time to work on it 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was a really enjoyable contest
 Hjax: ive been busy some days and lazy the others so far :D 
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I'm still lazy to rewrite my contest code, I already updated it a while ago
 MSmits: never redone any contest yet
 Astrobytes: yeah but you're 1337
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I want to redo kutulu most of all
 MSmits: because i used c++ and my eval is crap
 MSmits: used C# i mean
 Aliot2000: hi baby
 Astrobytes: You just used sanity right?
 KiwiTae: did my sim in python for kutulu &gt;,&lt; terrible buggy 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i was afraid to go back right after contest
 MSmits: because if i improve it i might have been 1 at that point =/
 MSmits: that would have been frustrating
 MSmits: so better avoid it :P
 KiwiTae: :joy: MSmits trouble of the gods 
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Top 25 problems
 MSmits: hey, Astrobytes you coded a few mcts bots right?
 Astrobytes: Sure
 MSmits: did you ever do the 1 child continued expansion?
 Shadowtick: I made a song but I dont know what to title it
 MSmits: i am trying this in bandas, if 3 of the children are immediately solved, keep expanding
 MSmits: saves you from doing the whole selection thing again
 Astrobytes: No I don't believe I've tried that, sounds worthwhile
 MSmits: for some games yeah
 Shadowtick: :3 anyways I am gonna go do some puzzles or play doom
 MSmits: in oware it is nice, especially if you have a endgame db, so if all moves except one go below 7 seeds, keep going with the one move
 MSmits: unless you found a win ofc
 MSmits: puzzles or doom...
 MSmits: or doompuzzles
 Astrobytes: makes sense, seems much more efficient
 MSmits: if i search doom, i get 6 users named doom, but no puzzle
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 Shadowtick: no I meant the game
 MSmits: we got this
 Astrobytes: Now we need a Doom multi
 Shadowtick: huh?
 MSmits: we got cultist wars :P
 Astrobytes: Nothing, just ignore us
 Shadowtick: MSmits If you have google sites I can give you the embed code for doom
 MSmits: no need
 MSmits: but thanks
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-VTfcmrLEQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-VTfcmrLEQ</a>
 Shadowtick: welp they blocked doom
 MSmits: this is seems great
 MSmits: for teaching search algo's. They got one for DFS too
 Shadowtick:&#160;;-; I cant play it on my google site anymore
 Astrobytes: lol, nice MSmits
 Aliot2000: hi dude
 Astrobytes: The music really worked haha. Great visualisation though
 Astrobytes: Explains the whole thing in one go
 Astrobytes: DFS one is just as good
 MSmits: only thing it lacks is a pathfinding goal. But I guess this is fine. I can use it in the course and say things like: "Say our goal is node 75, which algorithm finds the goal fastest"
 Astrobytes: Well yeah, you can adapt to your needs. But this demonstrates the algorithm prefectly
 Astrobytes: *perfectly
 MSmits: yeah, as a video is perfect
 MSmits: also nice would be an animation with settings that you can control
 MSmits: like the physics apps here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">https://phet.colorado.edu/</a>
 Astrobytes: You could do that in C# or python yourself
 MSmits: sure, but might be a lot of work
 MSmits: a
 MSmits: also the visual part is hard
 MSmits: for me anyway
 Astrobytes: doesn't need to be fancy
 MSmits: it helps if it is though, when teaching
 MSmits: or at least looks minimally good
 Astrobytes: there are graph visualisation libs 
 MSmits: hmm
 Astrobytes: python man, import universe
 MSmits: true&#160;:)
 MSmits: I think I am going to go with the video and improve the course later
 MSmits: need to get something functional first
 MSmits: I am starting in 3 weeks
 Astrobytes: sure, you can work on it as a small project
 Astrobytes: The vid will be great
 MSmits: I am thinking of maybe an unplugged activity where they have to apply the algorithm to a map on paper
 Astrobytes: I would definitely recommend that
 Astrobytes: It's a great exercise, it solidifies the process when you work it by hand
 MSmits: yeah
 Hjax: @MSmits have you seen this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/">https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/</a>
 Astrobytes: ooh yeah, totally forgot about that, good one
 MSmits: thats great Hjax, thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: that'd work great
 Shadowtick: can someone tell me if my song is bad?
 Shadowtick: because I need to know if I should quit while I am just starting
 KiwiTae: Shadowtick sure
 KiwiTae: share 
 Majeck: Sure
 Shadowtick: I sent the link to you two
 professional_dumbass: me too!
 Bouuuuuh: yes share the link
 Shadowtick: ok but I dont do it in here
 Astrobytes: why not
 Shadowtick: because I feel like i would be advertising more and getting kicked for it
 Astrobytes: hardly advertising if you want an opinion on it
 eulerscheZahl: KiwiTae link your youtube channel to counter the advertising
 Bouuuuuh: this is your first song&#160;?
 Astrobytes: what style is it?
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is italic</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: :smirk:

 Shadowtick: oh I dont know what kind of genre or style it is
 Shadowtick: it's my first time
 Astrobytes: Random. Chromatic tone clusters.
 Majeck: I'd recommend getting a rhythm down and maybe adding chords or something to counter the melody
 Shadowtick: well it is my first song so I didn't know how to do it
 Shadowtick: and I put one of my songs on my latest youtube video
 Bouuuuuh: you don't have any music theory&#160;? 
 Astrobytes: I would strongly recommend learning how to play something first
 Majeck: As always the internet is full of help for whatever you want to learn
 Bouuuuuh: you can find many ressources on youtube
 Shadowtick: well I was using that website to make the song
 Shadowtick: but the song on my dbd/dead by daylight video I uploaded is different

 MSmits: yay finally made unicode work. What a pain
 MSmits: my size 3 bandas endgame book: 
 MSmits: 鱝䓱
 MSmits: size 4: 鱝䓱ᦹ햫㮋䛗ᆵᦹ햫ࡉ
 MSmits: not sure if those squares will work, might be invalid
 jacek: squares will work, you just cant print them
 MSmits: ok, but if i paste them into the IDE they will be recognized?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: cool thanks
 MSmits: this is way easier than I thought it would be
 MSmits: well the encoding
 MSmits: not the c++ syntax of it
 MSmits: whoever designed that wstring/wchar stuff should be shot :P
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: i tried so many different ways to get a wchar from a number and then add it to a wstring
 MSmits: I ended up doing:
 MSmits: wstring output = L"";wstring b = L"a";b[0] += encodedNumber;output += b;
 MSmits: could only add numbers to the wstrings accessed as arrays, nothing else worked for me
 MSmits: there might be an easier way I missed of course
 jacek: why adding number?
 jacek: you want int16 number into wchar?
 MSmits: well that, but also add the wchar to the wstring i am building
 MSmits: first few characters of unicode seemed like they wouldnt work so i decided to start at "a"
 MSmits: I am storing in ternary anyway, so i can store 10 values in a unicode char, using most of the range
 MSmits: 1* first + 3* second + 9* third etc. up to 10
 MSmits: makes a number below 65k so it fits in unicode
 MSmits: when decoding i just subtract 'a' and then use powers of 3 to get the values back
 MSmits: basically this way, I can store maybe 80k or so unicode characters holding 800k loss/win/draw values for my bandas endgames
 MSmits: using symmetry, a few million even
 jacek: how does improve your winrate
 MSmits: i am testing that now. I currently have a size 9 endgame book, so max is 3x3 
 MSmits: book vs book as 1p gives me 70%
 MSmits: no book vs book as 1p gives me 49%
 MSmits: p1 has an advantage of 70-30 in bandas
 MSmits: kind of like uttt
 MSmits: so it's pretty damned strong to have an endgame book
 MSmits: and I'd like it to be bigger&#160;:)
 MSmits: up to 12 is possible
 MSmits: 13 doesnt exist and 14 is way too big to fit

 Edzz: What's up
 DanniBoy: yoo
 WesCraterMadman: hey I'm working on The Labyrinth puzzle and I think I'm missing some key insight. Anyone here have experience with that one?
 WesCraterMadman: aight good taljk
 davilla: haven't done that one, sorry
 masterbhai: \hrw.agrw
 masterbhai: eghiruagiruw
 masterbhai: fgouwgiruw
 KiwiTae: WesCraterMadman yaaa
 KiwiTae: did it
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 ZuhairAbid: hey
 ZuhairAbid: can anyone help me?
 jacek: ask specific question
 ZuhairAbid: How can I find which problems I have solved
 jacek: puzzles?
 ZuhairAbid: no problems
 ZuhairAbid: algorithm problems
 Doju: argh i hate this language so much
 Doju: how can anyone enjoy writing c++
 ZuhairAbid: dont write in C++ then
 Doju: i need the speed though&#160;:/
 ZuhairAbid: what about javascript?
 Doju: i'd very much like to write in python but its so slow
 jacek: in puzzles page at the bottom you have puzzles and/or problems you solved. for clashes there is not such thing
 Doju: ZuhairAbid for competitions i kinda need c++
 Doju: or at least a compiled language
 jacek: c is also fast :v
 ZuhairAbid: like competetive programming?
 jacek: multiplayer bot programming
 Doju: ZuhairAbid the challenges on this site
 MSmits: Doju learn rust
 Doju: like the upcoming spring challenge
 MSmits: it's just as fast
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: and much more enjoyable, apparently
 Doju: MSmits thanks for the recommendation
 Doju: I'll have a look
 MSmits: we have some experts here, try dbdr if he is on
 jacek: for spring challenge you wont likely need that much speed. java or c# would suffice
 jacek: mostly likely it will be heuristics battle
 MSmits: in most contests you will do fine with C# and java yes.
 MSmits: the simpler the game,the more performance will matter
 PrivateDidgeridoo_374e: can anyone help me that how can I make  strtol alike function?
 Doju: Yeah
 MSmits: and most of the time these games are not simple
 Doju: I did decently well in the pac one with a heuristics bot written in python
 Doju: in the fall challenge i did terribly with a search written in python
 MSmits: thats actually a game where performance helps more than average, (the pacman one)
 dbdr: jacek why do you think speed won't matter?
 MSmits: Doju the rust guy just arrived
 ZuhairAbid: @ jacek wheres the puzzle page
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Doju: Oo
 ZuhairAbid: wheres the puzzle page?
 jacek: dbdr for challenges at least in the beginning its heuristic battle
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 MSmits: i skip that, i spend 3 days writing a search bot and then shoot up to silver :P
 Doju: Hey dbdr any tips on learning rust?
 dbdr: yes, but at the end perf often matters
 Doju: And do you think I should learn rust instead of c++ for the challenges here?
 dbdr: Doju what languages do you already know?
 Doju: python and javascript
 AntiSquid: what's up with the yellow dots on "YOUR LAST ACTIVITIES"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/aGcuFq0">https://imgur.com/a/aGcuFq0</a>
 dbdr: ok. personally I would recommend rust over cpp for challenges. however if you want to get a job with it too you have much more options with cpp
 AntiSquid: not all have it, but it's there
 AntiSquid: ontopic: rust syntax is a bit confusing to me
 jacek: AntiSquid i have tick there
 MSmits: he already said he hates writing cpp though, so i doubt he would want a job coding it. He would hate his job
 dbdr: ok, missed that part
 Doju: Well, I think i'd enjoy the language a bit more if i understood it
 Doju: but at least for now it's pure pain
 Doju: to do anything
 MSmits: well it does have a steep learning curve
 MSmits: I am at the bottom of it still and no incentive to climb up 
 dbdr: AntiSquid: that's fair enough, but syntax does not stay a problem if you keep using a language, it's just the early days
 AntiSquid: so what's the speed difference rust vs c++&#160;? 
 dbdr: very little
 MSmits: I dont think there is one AntiSquid, from what i have read. It depends on the operation you are doing 
 MSmits: it's in the fuzzy area
 AntiSquid: didn't even look into setting it up locally to use for other stuff, but this would matter to me, along with what other use cases it has apart from CG 
 AntiSquid: for me personally i mean
 dbdr: are you guys doing any multi these days?
 jacek: what else should we do? clashes?
 MSmits: i dont have much time atm, but I am going to try machine learning once i do. I converted the xor example to c++ last night
 AntiSquid: i did, i know it's hard to notice when my rank / cp doesn't change much dbdr :P
 MSmits: then will try on oware
 dbdr: I just started TryAngle, was easy to climb up, so I guess not many have tried hard
 AntiSquid: there are too many multis and too little time for me
 AntiSquid: i want to have a look at all of them, so i just made a "ranking system" to see what i prioritise based on personal preferences :D
 dbdr: I have a physical oware now by the way&#160;:)
 jacek: with seeds?
 MSmits: nice
 AntiSquid: does it have real biodegradable beans?
 dbdr: no, stones
 MSmits: you mean you kept an egg carton instead of throwing it away dbdr?
 dbdr: lol
 AntiSquid: you only need half a carton
 MSmits: mmh dont you need 12 holes?
 AntiSquid: use the other half to simulate future moves while making your opponent wait
 MSmits: they package eggs weirdly in GB?
 AntiSquid: i was thinking of 12 egg boxes
 MSmits: oh right
 AntiSquid: there's 6 egg, 12 egg, 15 and even 30 
 jacek: huh? there are only 10 and 30 here
 dbdr: unknown guy is #1 in TryAngle
 MSmits: btw, i apologize now for changing the subject to eggs
 AntiSquid: anything higher than that you get in boxes of stacked up 30 egg trays 
 dbdr: kovi #2
 kovi: maniak is moderately strong topcoder
 jacek: never heard of him
 dbdr: oh ok, just not active here
 AntiSquid: lots of unknown guys climbing high, in 1 or 2 games, they clearly don't have much time either
 kovi: its a nice heuristic game, would have been a greet early2021 challenge
 AntiSquid: are you doing top coder jacek&#160;?
 MSmits: I'm ok with that, as long as each game has some reasonable spread of opponents strengths
 jacek: no
 dbdr: kovi, I don't even take opponent into account :D
 AntiSquid: having an AutomatonNN moment then&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: why really cant do this?
 dbdr: and ignore most of the rules
 MSmits: like muzero
 MSmits: thats pro
 kovi: after bandas i might get back to tryangle
 AntiSquid: i expect another sim favoring game in next contest
 MSmits: what does that mean
 MSmits: do you mean a search favoring game?
 AntiSquid: like fall2020
 MSmits: i mean any good bot in any game will use sim
 MSmits: even heuristic bots use sim
 MSmits: i think you mean search
 MSmits: like, search to some depth
 MSmits: if you find a path with pacman to find the closest thingy to eat, you're simming, because BFS is a simulation
 AntiSquid: i say sim, because for heuristic you don't need high focus on them
 dbdr: you can have a pure heuri without sim. just if then else spagetthi&#160;:)
 MSmits: usually when people say they only use if else, they still sim. Some of those conditons will usuall contain some simulation element
 AntiSquid: it's more about knowing what are best moves for given states, you don't need to always predict how it affects the game
 kovi: in my view heuristic = simplified modelcan include sim/search
 MSmits: thats what I meant
 AntiSquid: with heuristics i mean something that resembles doing NN with handcoded / submit spam derived weights :P
 MSmits: ohh... real AI&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: lots of hype recently about real AI in papers and videos
 AntiSquid: but then when you read the fine print ... you see it's more speculation that we are closer
 MSmits: AI is a super vague term anyway
 MSmits: people used to call a BFS algorithm AI
 MSmits: because it looks intelligent
 MSmits: ohh, it goes around obstacles...
 AntiSquid: overly used and misused&#160;?
 MSmits: hard to say it is misused when it is poorly defined
 MSmits: but overly used, yeah
 MSmits: it also annoys me that when people discuss AI it is automatically assumed to be some form of machine learning
 MSmits: I feel AI is about acting intelligently, no matter how this was achieved
 MSmits: and AI has a whole history that predates machine learning
 Passifi: well aren't we like peak hype cycle for AI in general period&#160;? I really wonder whether it will truly serve me my big mac in the next 10 years ...
 MSmits: it will not
 MSmits: it will try to convince you to eat healthier
 Passifi: fair chance
 Passifi: so it will serve me mc donalds salad the future is truly a darl place
 Passifi: *dark
 MSmits: it will probably sabotage all mcdonalds to save the human race
 AntiSquid: well back your SIM + BFS analogy, is that AI or just an algo to you&#160;?
 KiwiTae: it will feed u the momery of eating a bigmac after you ate your salad
 MSmits: well you're asking me what the definition of AI is, but I am not the person who decides what words mean. 
 KiwiTae: in the industry they call AI anything that automates tasks..
 MSmits: BFS causes intelligent behavior though
 jacek: imo AI is broader term. id say its AI if it acts smart, even if its just some ifology
 KiwiTae: brings investors in cause its a cool word
 MSmits: and a simulation is needed to predict the future, also a part of intelligence
 AntiSquid: you need to research the MCdonalds salad dressing Passifi, on the topic of eating healthy&#160;:)
 MSmits: i tend to agree with jacek
 Passifi: oh I
 MSmits: in my ai course i started with pathfinding
 Passifi: d never eat their salad
 MSmits: then some optimization, minimax, q learning and NNs
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aOYA1mE_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aOYA1mE_700bwp.webp</a>
 Passifi:  I think they got rid of it in the US because they thought it actually hurt business ^
 AntiSquid: ya Kiwi, do they call an automated script AI too&#160;? 
 Passifi: You go to a fast food place to greasen up your arteries so that the blood flows properly again. Everyone knows that
 jacek: i heard they serve salad in macdonalds even if people dont eat it, because it makes them less guilty of eating unhealthy
 KiwiTae: AntiSquid yea... 
 MSmits: makes the food more colourful
 KiwiTae: some game AI are just scripted... go straight until hitbox then jump... repeat
 MSmits: I remember eating at a Chinese restaurant with my family and they made these pretty flowers out of carrots
 MSmits: I ate everyone's flowercarrot and then my family said i shouldnt because they were just decoration
 jacek: and made of plastic
 KiwiTae: they serve cornsoup in mc donalds in taipei so good
 MSmits: lol no 
 AntiSquid: is it proper US GMO cornsoup&#160;?
 MSmits: aren't dogs basically GMD's&#160;?
 MSmits: even though we didnt do it in a lab
 MSmits: or GMW's 
 AntiSquid: something like this (carrots) or were they spiralled together&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/bf/cb/95bfcb0a8d0dbbe1130cf1ea5c5fefff.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/bf/cb/95bfcb0a8d0dbbe1130cf1ea5c5fefff.jpg</a>
 MSmits: we made species that have noses too short to breathe properly or with skulls to small for their brain cuz we thought they looked cute
 AntiSquid: i know what you mean MSmits
 MSmits: AntiSquid these look better, they were more spiralled i think
 Passifi: I always thought this was a weird simily breeding selectivly isn't the same as GMing something. There is plenty of healthy genetic chaos in the mix which clearly smoothens out the human influence also where we overdid it. It did lead to severe problems for the dogs nevertheless... 
 MSmits: it's not exactly the same, but you're still removing natural selection from the equation and selecting by some other preference
 dbdr: it's another form of natural selection
 MSmits: as evidenced by the difference between breeds of dogs, this goes very very far
 AntiSquid: controlled natural selection 
 MSmits: dbdr sure but that's taking a very wide definition of "natural"
 dbdr: humans are natural animals&#160;:)
 MSmits: right
 AntiSquid: well when you use viruses, agro bacteria or chemicals to modify something then it seems unnatural to me
 armalitedev: pog
 MSmits: it happens naturally also
 AntiSquid: and they are playing basically with this stuff, the science isn't that well researched yet, i mean there wasn't enough time
 MSmits: yeah there's risk
 MSmits: but not the risk people think it has
 AntiSquid: obviously since it's funded, "someone" wants to see results and earn profits from the investments
 MSmits: people think the stuff is not safe to eat, but thats nonsense
 MSmits: it's mostly that the stuff might become a plague and drown out all other species
 armalitedev: amogus
 Passifi: there is a huge difference in speed and concentration and that can lead to pretty dire outcomes later on think of chinese super babies that just drop dead by the age of 20 
 armalitedev: sus
 MSmits: Passifi huh?
 MSmits: do you mean because they ate corn?
 Passifi: also there was artificial food we considered to be safe and sound  and then later on we found it to be harmful like trans fats&#160;:)
 Passifi: oh I was thinking gm in general 
 Passifi: although corn syrup for example is pretty bad for your health&#160;;)
 MSmits: you have to be careful about comparing things like those transfats and gm corn though
 MSmits: it's still corn, it just does what it does more efficiently
 AntiSquid: workers that drop dead when they reach their expiry date so they won't be a burden on the pension fund :thinking:
 MSmits: well if they made it so they wouldnt expire at all, that would be better 
 AntiSquid: sure everything is possible, but then would we have highly restrictive lockdowns when a virus could supposedly get rid of all the pensioneers&#160;?
 MSmits: no i meant, just work for eternity, who said anything about pensioneers
 MSmits: these guys dont age
 AntiSquid: talking to passifi :Pi am still reading as i type
 MSmits: lol
 leojean890: when I took AI course at school, I only learnt "minmax", "backtracking" ^^
 leojean890: (2012)
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense
 Passifi: but with additional experience they might get ideas and then revolt better to have them drop dead I say
 leojean890: I suppose now it'sonly ML
 MSmits: dont think so
 MSmits: i think they still start with algorithms such as bfs
 leojean890: many people think that ML == AI
 MSmits: CS 50 at harvard starts with BFS
 leojean890: yes, BFS is important to understand before learning the rest
 MSmits: when it's discussed by popular science things, like news/magazines yeah leojean890
 AntiSquid: Passifi, not a conspiracy, it's something china considers for their soldiers, helmets that detonate when needed, example soldier gets captured and might be interogated
 leojean890: sometimes they make an "advanced algo" course learning BFS
 Passifi: the courses I've taken all start with teaching me how to forget all the calculus I've learned and replace it with a different opimization method&#160;;)
 MSmits: I would just find a good old soup bowl
 leojean890: and then an AI course ^^
 AntiSquid: there was a video about ML just being a phase and after we make the process of automating the learning better we can focus on AI that derives new ideas from what it learns on it's own
 AntiSquid: wait i will link the video that better explains this :P
 MSmits: i should get back to work on my studies... deadlines approaching
 MSmits: ttyl guys
 Passifi: as long as we can make the ai follow the three laws we'll be fine&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: nvm can't find it, i think it was something Francois Chollet wrote and not a video actually, worth looking up this author
 AntiSquid: Passifi law 0 most important one, you don't want grown up babies that are taken care of by AI
 Passifi: Well what makes me the most worried about the future is the amount of people who think being a grown up baby being pampered by AI is a Utopian World&#160;;)
 Passifi: i've seen what a life without purpose does to people. It aint pretty, and once they got used to it its hard to get out of it. 
 Dekku: baro yleebo
 Dekku: &lt;3
 dbdr: Passifi on what kind of people have you seen that?
 Passifi: handicapped people I took care of back when I worked in that area. Retired elderly too. Now one would think its their deseases but nah those who got something to do( and not just busy work)  often do very well&#160;:) 
 Passifi: But those who don't... well it's just a sad sight to behold
 dbdr: yeah, feeling useful is super important
 AntiSquid: i used to work in a care home too, the time of the day when i went around to write down what each resident wants to eat was pretty much one of the highlight of their day, they'd open up and talk a lot ...
 davilla: man, how much XP do I need to reach level 20?
 davilla: I mean, are all the levels the same?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: nop
 davilla: this is going to take a while
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: ok you are level 14.. and i am 13.. i need 523xp in total.. to get to level 14.. what about you?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: it should be +523
 davilla: it saysLevel 14 (i)  ... 372/580 XP
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: 523-&gt;580-&gt;...
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: you need to find the function they are using to calculate XP growth 
 davilla: but how can I be on level 14 if I only have 372?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i am guessing it is more than just i+1-i
 davilla: oh, that's 372 just in level 14
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: it means eche level strats form 0 to it max xp
 davilla: right
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: go do all the easy puzzles and you might get level 20 in few days
 davilla: the easy puzzles are only +50 XP
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: the easy puzzles can sometimes be hard.. at least from my experience hhhhh
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: anyways have fun
 davilla: so how many XP is level 1?
 davilla: working backwards it's easy to get 55, which I think I remember seeing
 AntiSquid: davilla <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-experience-for-creating-puzzles">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/the-experience-for-creating-puzzles</a>
 WOLFRAHH: hii AntiSquid
 davilla: ah, thanks
 AntiSquid: you trying to get banned again WOLFRAHH&#160;?
 davilla: in the form of a puzzle&#160;:-P
 WOLFRAHH: why
 AntiSquid: you tell me why
 WOLFRAHH: ohh for saying hii
 WOLFRAHH: sorry
 AntiSquid: lol no, that's just the last nail in the coffin ...
 WOLFRAHH: i don't understand
 AntiSquid: consider the previous bans and consider what i told you before
 WOLFRAHH: yeah but i don't do anything
 davilla: OK so I just could solve 6 very hard puzzles or 60+ easy puzzles to get there.
 davilla: ooh how do you get collaboration?
 AntiSquid: ya classic ones only, newer ones only give 50xp
 davilla: oh the classic are worth more? good to know
 AntiSquid: what do you mean? collaboration
 davilla: WolfR has Coding Speed: Gold level, Collaboration: Silver level
 jacek: this mean he upvoted/approved or contributed in contributions
 AntiSquid: ah that's part of the quest map on the "front" page
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/home">https://www.codingame.com/home</a> scroll down davilla, just do those tasks and you can get that too
 davilla: that's just my quest map, I don't see any tasks
 icecream24: I just realized there is VIM mode for the editor. I am so happy&#160;:'D
 jacek: now you cant quit it
 AntiSquid: some of the quests on the quest map unlock those "certifications" 
 davilla: oh OK thanks
 davilla: I guess that must be down the Clash of Code path
 davilla: since that's the main one he seems to follow
 jacek: :scream:
 WOLFRAHH: hey can anybody tell me how i can be in 1000 position in clash of code it is my task in quest map
 jacek: do some clashes and dont be last
 davilla: write a program that minifies your programs
 WOLFRAHH: davilla are you saying to me
 WOLFRAHH: or saying to jacek
 davilla: you, it applies to your question
 davilla: but I was joking
 AntiSquid: each path has its own certifications
 WOLFRAHH: yeah my coding speed is gold level
 AntiSquid: you need to keep doing clash until you are top 1000 basically
 davilla: and then you need to stop doing clash
 WOLFRAHH: ohh why
 davilla: lest you fall out of top 1000
 WOLFRAHH: davilla
 davilla: no I'm joking again
 WOLFRAHH: ohh comon davilla
 WOLFRAHH: but i am solving CSB to wood 1 to bronze or my code beat the boss
 AntiSquid: my last cert for collaboration path: i need to make a contribution, either quick clash puzzle (i won't), puzzle or game, still overplanning the game
 davilla: now that's fun, I love the creative side
 davilla: made a few puzzles on codewars
 AntiSquid: you just need 1 and no creativity is required :D
 davilla: so do you want to bounce ideas or you have a plan already?
 AntiSquid: i have a plan, for a long time now, just not implemented
 davilla: ah OK I'm curious if you want to share
 AntiSquid: multiple ideas, but no don't want to share, sorry
 jacek: :mad:
 jacek: :rage:
 davilla: hey no problem, but I guess you don't get that collaboration badge then
 davilla:&#160;:-P
 davilla: good luck, anyway
 AntiSquid: i do, that's the weird part about "collaboration", you can do it alone
 davilla: lol
 davilla: is there any real collaboration that goes on here?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhh
 jacek: fireworks game :v
 davilla: I notices on codewars sometimes people got together to solve
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: let us collaborate in solving my puzzles
 davilla: what language? or is that a joke?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: just a joke hhhh
 jacek: oO
 davilla: OK cooperative game, there's a twise
 davilla: twist*
 WOLFRAHH: hey AntiSquid why u don't created any contribution to complete task on quest map 
 WOLFRAHH: Or you have achievements I'am a creator
 AntiSquid: that's different
 jacek: hes moderator
 AntiSquid: again different
 jacek: not a squid?
 WOLFRAHH: he is moderator this not make a sense jacek
 jacek: i agree
 GooMooc: hi all, someone know why a code work in my local python interpreter and return a TypeError in the Codingame interpretor?? How can i solve it&#160;?
 davilla: what version are you running locally?
 WOLFRAHH: yeah same queston GooMooc
 GooMooc: TypeError: sort() takes no positional argument
 WOLFRAHH: we are saying which version of python interpreter you have
 WOLFRAHH: GooMooc
 davilla: how are you using sort? are you giving it a key?
 davilla: or reversing the order?
 GooMooc: python 3.6
 WOLFRAHH: ohh
 GooMooc: i use ide geany and the command line are the same in local and codingame&#160;:
 WOLFRAHH: i think codingame is using 3.8
 GooMooc:         sfp.sort(sfp.sort(key=lambda x&#160;: x[0]), key=lambda y&#160;: y[1])
 davilla: sort doesn't return anything, does it?
 GooMooc: it change my sfp list order
 GooMooc: sfp is a tuple list with coordinate x and y
 davilla: that's a bit odd, I would write it in 2 lines
 davilla: or there's an easy way to combine it into a single sort
 WOLFRAHH: i agree with davilla
 GooMooc: ok, i know it could be written better or differently, but what it work in local and not in codingame ... the difference of version is the explanation???
 davilla: anyway I believe the reason you're getting the error is because it's giving None as an argument, since the inner sort doesn't return anything
 GooMooc: None as an argument? i dont understand
 davilla: myList.sort(None) gives the error you stated
 davilla: in 3.8
 GooMooc: def Limit2Center(xo,yo,center,sfp): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16ad69ce-b5bc-4497-9358-c98cb889ccbd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16ad69ce-b5bc-4497-9358-c98cb889ccbd</a>
 davilla: I don't have 3.6 on this computer but my guess is something has changed, even tho the docs are about the same
 GooMooc: ok so ill try to update my python and retry the function
 GooMooc: def Limit2Center(xo,yo,center,sfp): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/545c2099-02ef-49b0-abcf-5bb4c434dc2a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/545c2099-02ef-49b0-abcf-5bb4c434dc2a</a>
 davilla: the key insight here, if you're keen on learning, is that sort doesn't return anything
 davilla: a = [1, 3, 2]b = a.sort()print(b)  # None
 davilla: print(a)  # [1, 2, 3]
 GooMooc: You surely know more than me Davilla and thank for your answer but it work locally and return the list sorted as i want ... so i ve to update
 davilla: OK is it clear how to update?
 GooMooc: sudo apt get update
 davilla: oh you mean update the version of python, yeah that would probably be helpful
 Uljahn: also you don't need to sort to get the first element, you could use min/max with lambda key
 davilla: good point, that would surely be faster
 GooMooc: yes, there are other way... but i want to sort with multicriteria
 davilla: in that case I would do it in 2 lines
 davilla: first the one, then the other
 Uljahn: you can use a tuple of criterias in lambda function
 Uljahn: key=lambda x&#160;: (x[0], x[1])
 davilla: I love python because it lets you do stuff like that
 GooMooc: yes i ve beggining writing in two lines but only one seeming better
 davilla: well there are a couple of ways to write it on one line
 GooMooc: ty uljahn iv try this code but was not working locally
 davilla: one way is as mentioned with a single more complex keyanother way is to use sorted() instead of sort()
 GooMooc: i think it was returning None, so ive search an other way locally... and now it dont work in CG... lol
 GooMooc: yes i ve seen sorted but each loop my list change and i dont need to save it so sort was indicate
 davilla: cool
 davilla: well the complexity doesn't always follow the number of lines, I think is a key point
 davilla: min() is the fastest way for a single element, then sort() with a complex key, then sorted(), then 2 sort() on different lines, then 2 sorted() on one line
 davilla: anyway you have options
 GooMooc: I m learning coding, first i determinate what it needed to obtain a result and after that i ve to search command that can giveme the result... i m awake that there a lot of possibility to obtain the same result but i cant explore all of them in once.... but ok for min and max, ive use it in a precedent puzzle, now i sort....  ty all for your answer.
 davilla: great, glad we could help
 GooMooc: yes, ty for your help... updating my python will permit me to reproduce some step of CGcode
 Queuebee: Hey, I just accidentally got 100% on something with a wrong solution (ran tests to check and found that in 10% -- depending on parameters of the cases my code failed)
 Queuebee: Where can I send feedback?
 Queuebee: it's this puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paper-folding-curve">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paper-folding-curve</a>
 LifeSword: Hello. Can anyone tell me how to view the debug output? I'm using C+=, and I'm output to cerr, but I can't see that output anywhere in the editor.
 jacek: its left down corner, where you can see the standard output as well
 jacek: Queuebee you can tell it on forum
 LifeSword: I was doing a clash, and I all could see in the bottom left was the cout output.
 jacek: are you sure the cerr line was invoked then?
 jacek: and had endl at the end
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hello everyone, i have a question, to accept a contribution, do i have to solve it in all languages&#160;??
 AntiSquid: no
 jacek: only english and french
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: lol
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: i misread one of the check boxes 
 jacek: oO
 idfkJustMe: guys can u help to find slow start&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: "find slow start"&#160;?
 idfkJustMe: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't understand...
 idfkJustMe: ok, try to explain i am new in this platform so i dont no how to use it.someone say to go "Slow start" but cant find ))
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no such section. So it's normal you don't find.
 idfkJustMe: ok thx , is this platform for beginners&#160;?
 idfkJustMe: cuz its so hard for me to do smth.
 BlaiseEbuth: Depend of what you mean by beginner.
 BlaiseEbuth: If you have some basis so yes.
 idfkJustMe: i know basics
 BlaiseEbuth: So it's ok.
 idfkJustMe: ok thx a lot good luck.
 BlaiseEbuth: You can start here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>

 MasterCoderxD: heyguys
 MasterCoderxD: help
 MasterCoderxD: My Java code to check if a string is a palindrome or not isn't working 
 MasterCoderxD: I just started Java, I am more of a python (and C++) guy
 MasterCoderxD: My code;
 MasterCoderxD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de34261c-5b24-4cd8-b52e-be3595864aba">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/de34261c-5b24-4cd8-b52e-be3595864aba</a>
 MasterCoderxD: The issue is with the s==k part. When I print k, I see that k equals s, but still it prints false.
 MasterCoderxD: I think it might me some whitespace issue...
 DaNinja: s1.equals(s2)
 gorsat: I'm in the same boat as a java n00b. Kinda hate it. Anyway, you need to do s.equals(k) rather than s==k (which checks to see if they refer to the same string object)
 MasterCoderxD: ok thnx
 MasterCoderxD: gorsat use equals()  method like DaNinja says
 gorsat: not sure what the red text is. I obviously was not asking a question.
 orangesnowfox: gorsat: red text is "you were mentioned" (via someone typing your username)
 gorsat: Thanks orangesnowfox. :slight_smile:

 GooMooc: python3.8 installed and finally running with my ide, now the issue is the same in local and CG ide... Problem Solved.
 GooMooc: if xo &lt;= center and yo &lt;= center&#160;:
 GooMooc: is the correct syntax in 3.8
 jacek: :tada:
 Kellthazar: Urgh, this conway sequence puzzle...
 Kellthazar: My code can't pass test 4 and 6...
 Revenantus: Is it possible to play Clash of Code without entering the 'shortest code' challenges? I dislike those with the language variations.
 jacek: only in private clash
 orangesnowfox: ... Why does my search race bot keep failing 1-2 (random) test cases? 
 jacek: timeout?
 orangesnowfox: I mean, probably, but I also have it set to use 25 out of 50 ms ._.
 jacek: in optimizations there is lower margin of error. for 50ms try lower time to 35ms or less
 Revenantus: Thanks, Jacek. I'll just not worry too much about squeezing all the whitespace out of my solutions during those, then!
 jacek: oh hmm
 jacek: because its rust :v
 orangesnowfox: Nah, this is a copy of my CSB bot, it's C++
 orangesnowfox: jacek: It also randomly times out when I do the web ide tests... Despite, well having literally no reason to
 jacek: segfaults then?
 orangesnowfox: Wouldn't it give a message about segfaults?
 jacek: dunno
 jacek: what message do you get now
 orangesnowfox: "Timeout"
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: No stack trace in case of crash in C++ on CG.
 orangesnowfox: ah, right, because O3
 jacek: too much ozone
 BlaiseEbuth: Numa numa yeah...
 orangesnowfox: ... I swapped out my clock impl and everything was fine
 orangesnowfox: note to self `ctime`'s clock is *not* what I want to be using, apparently
 orangesnowfox: That sounds highly unlikely, but, whatever
 jacek: use chrono [solved]
 orangesnowfox: yeah, basically.
 MACKEYTH: Is there any word on when the 2020 Fall contest is going to make its way into puzzles and competition?

 JBM: why yours before the oters?
 C_breeze: sorry to bother
 AntiSquid: ya we have an unwritten rule here to approve the ones linked in chat last, sorry
 MadKnight: ..... unless it's like 1 confirm away and is running out of time
 AntiSquid: then we frown it away
 MadKnight: but is it their fault&#160;?
 C_breeze: didn't realise, it has a day left to validate so can wait I guess
 AntiSquid: always
 AntiSquid: ah well is it clash&#160;?
 C_breeze: not clash
 Kapanion: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/166270818a0281463438ef32100ff0698189b12">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/166270818a0281463438ef32100ff0698189b12</a>
 AntiSquid: oh it's not clash, here's a suggestion then, because i hate clash: make it work in progress and then make it live again since that way you avoid it being taken down, but in your case it won't matter you don't have any approvers
 AntiSquid: weird you seem to have good comments, no approvals though
 AntiSquid: ioane_kapanadze use #clash channel to post those links please
 Kapanion: ok
 jacek: hmm why would guy put minimax tag for atari go but not mcts
 Kaquino: hey guys i have a bug 
 Kaquino: i can’t concat on php 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.in/php/operators/concatenation-operators/">https://www.w3schools.in/php/operators/concatenation-operators/</a>
 AntiSquid: lol .in duckduckgo result @_@
 Sekseos: Can you still edit past clash game code that you didnt get a chance to finish?
 jacek: no
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hello everyone, how difficult is the Atari Go bot programming??
 normrm2191: it looked like it would take a while so I honestly skipped it
 therealbeef: Do the optimization games have an issue with timeouts? I'm getting random validator failures on Search Race unless I dial down my timeout to 30ms
 normrm2191: yep, thats how they determine if ur code is optimized enough 
 therealbeef: I mean, for SR you get 50ms per turn but if i stay close to that 50ms I get random fails (but never in IDE tests)
 therealbeef: That kind of think never happened to me in multis
 orangesnowfox: therealbeef: yeah, optimization puzzles are more strict with their timers
 AntiSquid: therealbeef i swear there's something wrong with search race validators or the entire timeout thing, i get very random timeouts, always on different validator
 AntiSquid: and it's just that opti puzzle that has this issue for me
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: same though
 AntiSquid: think there's a bug in there, 100% there is mean
 orangesnowfox: Well, actually, it's all
 AntiSquid: because i played all test cases multiple times and checked them carefully, i don't timeout in any way and also i complete all tracks in a good time
 AntiSquid: i am really annoyed actually about it
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: Yeah, I normally have to submit at least twice
 orangesnowfox: and I only use 36 ms
 AntiSquid: it times out at 42 and 30 ms too . that doesn't make any sense
 orangesnowfox: yeah... It times out *less* at 30 
 orangesnowfox: but... "sighs"
 AntiSquid: i get 98% most of the time and as i said, different validator each time.
 orangesnowfox: mhm
 orangesnowfox: yeah, same
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: What do you use for time?
 AntiSquid: i think i tried both high precision and steady clock, let me check @_@
 AntiSquid: my if-else JS solution doesn't timeout, but that's not a surprise i guess&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Ah, so std::chrono, well, there's that suggestion gone :v
 AntiSquid: steady clock resubbed just now and ... waiting ... oh 76% with 40 ms timeout hahaha
 orangesnowfox: hahaha... Tuning is a pain
 therealbeef: 35ms is ok for me, but 40ms i always get 1 or 2. at 48 i get between 1 and 5, never 0
 orangesnowfox: Same on 2048 tho
 AntiSquid: i have no timeout issues on that one but i use fixed depth
 AntiSquid: no time check
 orangesnowfox: multiple answers per turn, still use timer
 orangesnowfox: ... I'm trying to decide how much time I want to devote to random sims, how much to depth, and how much to ga *sigh*
 AntiSquid: it's a really weird one imo (2048) some cases lower depth yields better score
 AntiSquid: also keeping too many branches can decrease score too :D
 orangesnowfox: hahaha... Yeah...
 orangesnowfox: I use 0 game specific knowledge in my 2048, it's a bit of a pain to tune
 Rag: is there a way to only queue for specific clash of code types?
 AntiSquid: i tried "monotonous sequence" check and the "snake sequence" check both can be negative
 AntiSquid: see if any of this helps you orangesnowfox <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048</a>
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid: But you have access to the rng...
 AntiSquid: read through it
 AntiSquid: you can ignore the rng part
 AntiSquid: it has some good heuristics, at least good source of inspiration
 AntiSquid: did something along those lines, but not entirely
 orangesnowfox: I'll look at it then
 AntiSquid: also my code isn't optimized 
 AntiSquid: well you're at 12mil, i am currently at 3.2 mil, probably can reach 4.5 mil with a bit of optimization, but need to do massive changes for better performance
 AntiSquid: did you use bitmasks orangesnowfox&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: bitmasks for *what* AntiSquif
 orangesnowfox: *AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: speed
 orangesnowfox: No... "for which thing"
 AntiSquid: for the table itself
 orangesnowfox: No... I store the power of 2 instead of the value itself though
 orangesnowfox: I could maybe store a side-table of zeros, but I'm not sure how I'd use that
 AntiSquid: right, how do you sort best branches without heuristics&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: "score"
 AntiSquid: that's still a heuristic :P
 orangesnowfox: Technically a heuristic
 orangesnowfox: But not a game specific one
 orangesnowfox: :p
 AntiSquid: well here the score is gamespecific :P what values you combine
 orangesnowfox: hush you :p
 AntiSquid: score alone gives me a bad result
 orangesnowfox: Code must be slow :wink:
 AntiSquid: i get worse result
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, but also, how many moves per turn?
 orangesnowfox: Also, do you use move 1 fully? That helped a lot (saved about 30 turns worth of moves for me)
 orangesnowfox: My typical problem is running out of time... I have depth = 30
 AntiSquid: well if i use the just score heuristic then there's less time involved selecting best ones
 AntiSquid: that would be the only diff in the code so theoretically i should get better score if that's the better heuristic
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... And, it isn't lol
 AntiSquid: true it is not switched back to my own heuristic, did few submits, gained +200k points from my previous best +1 rank, marginal improvement but shows which heuristic is better
 AntiSquid: orangesnowfox are you going to try the heuristics i linked see if you climb higher?
 orangesnowfox: Probably lol
 AntiSquid: the "Monotonicity" 100% helps
 orangesnowfox: Yeah... I'm not sure how to quantify that lol
 AntiSquid: you pick any corner you prefer and check from there how many numbers are sequentially smaller
 orangesnowfox: hmm, but what about transpositions?
 orangesnowfox: and "sequentially smaller" in which direction?
 Rival819: im taking a free C# class on Codecademy.....then coming back here hehe will understand a lot better its already awespme what I have achieved learning 
 Rival819: im bronze 33 in CSB
 Rival819: from no knowlede
 Rival819: knowledge, so now will be back in force
 Rival819: hehe
 Rival819: im learning concatenations and interpolations of text atm
 Rival819:&#160;:)
 Rival819: well almost done that part actually
 orangesnowfox: AntiSquid... I suddenly am really tempted to re-implement my code in c++ to see if it goes faster
 orangesnowfox: But I'm *tired* right now, so I have to convince myself I really don't want to

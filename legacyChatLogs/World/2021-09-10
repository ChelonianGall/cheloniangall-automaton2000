 ESMAKING: mHello
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hello guys
 derjack: good morning
 ESMAKING: pls help me get good at programming
 Uljahn: how?
 BlaiseEbuth: MAgic
 MiyamuraIzumi: practise make perfect
 Uljahn: or use magic pills "Instaprocoder"
 C26_1: um
 C26_1: @ESMAKING
 ESMAKING: yes?
 C26_1: I'm just learn "how to good at programming" by a coder
 C26_1: He's very good at programming
 ESMAKING: oh wow, tell me more pls
 C26_1: He's say that you don't need to compare yourself with other
 C26_1: That is 99.99% reason that a programmer will give up their job
 C26_1: Also, practice makes you better and better at coding
 C26_1: And
 BlaiseEbuth: :violin:
 C26_1: If your job's salary is not high enough
 C26_1: compare to your freinds' job salary 
 C26_1: don't worry
 C26_1: Everyone has their own life
 ESMAKING: thank you so much, now im ready to be best programmer
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't compare to others... Except for salary.
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 C26_1: Maybe your boss or a lot of your friend has more money than you, but who cares, maybe their job is harder or their lovers is stricter at money
 C26_1: And
 C26_1: Any pros come from noobs being
 C26_1: so don't worry if you didn't become a pro yet
 C26_1: Does you to expect that you can speak when you 5 months old?
 C26_1: No
 C26_1: So. That's it. That's all things that I can say
 C26_1: And....
 C26_1: Do you scare at math
 C26_1: i think programming is rely a lot on math and your google skill
 C26_1: becuase anyway, every single question that has been ask in programming language sovled
 C26_1: You just need google it
 C26_1: 10% your success on PG is only rely on your computer or how many money you have
 C26_1: 90% is the rest
 Uljahn: C26_1: do you want to be a better coder or just to flood the chat?
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: I'm just introduce tips for beginners, I thinK?
 BlaiseEbuth: lel
 Uljahn: look at your level, jeez
 ESMAKING: dont be rude 
 derjack: just start making projects. they can be simple. the code can look ugly. just start doing something
 Uljahn: i doubt someone can give valuable tips while being noob himself
 derjack: overcome any problem youll get
 BlaiseEbuth: If you have a heart let him speak and give him a :thumbsup:
 derjack: mods dont have hearts
 Uljahn: :broken_heart:
 ESMAKING: uljahn is idiot!!!

 _NikJ: Python codegolfers: Many CoC require outputting lowercase boolean true/false. Python print True/False by default, what is the shortest way of making it lowercase?
 gugrbywitkr: i saw ['false','true'][bool]
 gugrbywitkr: but its not shortest probably
 Uljahn: 'ftarlusee'[bool::2] is shorter
 Uljahn: the hint is from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/</a>

 ProCoder03: should it be shorter or faster&#160;??
 codeing: bith
 codeing: both
 sprkrd: no point of making it faster, really, it's not like you can't squeeze so much performance from such a simple task
 sprkrd: mind you, you can do it shorter
 sprkrd: may I suggest checking other people's solutions?
 sprkrd: You can do that once you solve a problem all by yourself, which seems you've already done
 ProCoder03: have 2 variable dirX and dirY, and do it with just 2 if else 
 ProCoder03: don't have umpteen elifs
 codeing: k

 Uljahn: ye, in around 15 lines
 z64555: @codeing I recommend using nested ifs to start off with.  One comparison per if makes it easier to read
 z64555: "try to make your code so that a blurry eyed, hung over you can understand it" seems to work well
 chop-chop: @Uljanh, thx
 GerJoe: how can I learn something here if I don´t know what to do in the clash???
 derjack: then do puzzles, not clashes
 GerJoe: ok. there you can learn?
 chop-chop: I skip such clashes and take new one. and one by one steps learning
 Uljahn: do some tutorials first (not on this site)
 GerJoe: I did tutorials, I learned JS but I suck at using it...that is why I found this site, which should help me why I learn...at least that was in the ad
 Justin-Truong: WHo want to play coding escape
 Uljahn: then try easy puzzles, solve classic ones first (without an author specified)
 derjack: try descent, thor, temperatures
 Uljahn: ye, also mars lander, horse racing

 darkhorse64: He detects his loss quite late in the game unless he is playing a very bad move suddenly

 darkhorse64: Usually you can predict the outcome 20 moves before the end

 struct: I feel like bt is the only game where I solve earlier than other players, at least the ones that show it
 struct: But with 1k exploration factor I cant expect to solve early :D

 Maxim251: I have technical question, On toturial in French I readed that he thinks that POINT to describe bot position is easier if will be made as class obiect... I want ask You coleques if is better to use obiect POINT to hold x, y values, or stor it straight in bot class. I am using C++ but that question is aplaying to any obiect oriented language
 jacek: tutorial in french?
 jacek: and i'd use class
 darkhorse64: It all depends if you want to use OOP design for your bot. I would say do it because it will allow you to have arithmetic operators on points and simplify your code
 struct: just do it like me and code everything on main
 struct: Maxim251 where is this tutorial? and which part is it
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb.html</a>
 Maxim251: I want rewrite Coders Strike back and as reference I want use his experience.
 struct: using pointers is fine 
 struct: if you dont want to make copies of the gamestate and such
 struct: its a design choice
 struct: you can either have
 Maxim251: But i want use OOP .. as exercise.
 struct: GameState {Pod pods[4];};
 struct: or GameState {Pod *pods;};
 Maxim251: O yes, in future that can be usefull
 darkhorse64: Please note that his comments on Vector class are somewhat outdated. My recommandation is to use it. I did that without any loss on performances
 struct: I usually go with the first approach 
 struct: maxim also if you can provide a simple snippet so I can understand better what you want to do
 struct: Ill try to help a bit more
 struct: Can be code non related to csb
 jacek: struct doesnt trust classes. theyre hiding something
 darkhorse64: Same. If you know in advance your data size, no need to allocate it
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/qnhahU1">https://tech.io/snippet/qnhahU1</a>
 Maxim251: its starting point, how I think it should look OOP desighn. But this time I want put functions in proper classes, not all functions in one class... 
 struct: looks ok if  you are getting into it
 struct: also I would make checkpoints static so all pods share it
 darkhorse64: int distance( POINT p ) -&gt; int distance(const Point&amp;p). You are making uneccessary copies
 Maxim251: Thats why I try use a reference from Frenche tutorial, because its the closest of what I want
 struct: ah darkhorse is right
 struct: When you pass a struct/class without reference it copies it
 Maxim251: Yes, I know... But for now, I want focused at OOP desighn
 struct: this is what my csb would look like +-
 struct: PointCheckpoint has Point;Pod has Point;GameState has Pods and Checkpoints
 Maxim251: last time, I was exercising inheruitance In C++. Now I want learn what functionality brake in to parts, that whole class structure, will look nice and simple
 darkhorse64: my personal taste: don't use accessors on trivial data structures
 struct: something like that
 darkhorse64: struct: agree with you except CheckPoint is a Point
 struct: you are right
 Maxim251: Then rather use BOT{ Position position;} Easier is using BOT{ intx, int y; } Because is trivial and its no need to over complicate it? 
 Astrobytes: Agree with darkhorse64 re. accessors on trivial data structures, ESPECIALLY on CG
 struct: Position position is fine imo, so you can share methods from Position
 struct: Maxim251 also I would check inoryy csb code so you can get a better idea if you are lost
 darkhorse64: I would not do that. You will to reimplement distance to Point for Pod
 Maxim251: Oki... I think is easier pass Pos, rather using ( x, y ) 
 struct: By Position I thought he meant point
 darkhorse64: Yes
 Maxim251: Thats the point, csb I look at his code, but for me, his desighn of classes looks litle wired.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, why pass x and y when you have a Point class?
 jacek: thats pointless isnt it
 Astrobytes: It's not meant to be a shining example of perfect OOP practice
 Maxim251: I was using always pair&lt; int, int&gt; to store position, but csb uses class.
 Astrobytes: It's hints and tips for implementing a bot for CSB
 Astrobytes: Yes, because sometimes you might want to inherit from your Point class, but not inherit from std::pair
 Maxim251: Ooowww... Thats good point
 Astrobytes: There are many different approaches
 Astrobytes: You might implement your pods or checkpoints or whatever with std::pair, but it would be a completely different approach from this 
 Maxim251: Yeah, less duplicating obiect creation for pos...
 Astrobytes: Anyway, sorry for butting into the conversation :D
 jacek: :unamused:
 Astrobytes: Feel free to continue, I'm leaving
 Maxim251: Have good night, or day...

 Pappijx: can anyone help with calendar problem 
 Maxim251: How I can use int distance, I am struggling between bot and checkpoint. In game I have input distance between Bot and Checkpoint, I have class BOT and class Checkpoint, where is the best store integer distance?
 Pappijx: Given a start date with a known week day, your program must compute the day of the week at another date anytime in the same year.
 YurkovAS: Maxim251 use float, store in stack :smile:

 Maxim251: yeah,,,  I dont care about return type, In OOP I have two classes, and I have value of distance, i dont know to where store that value, in bot class or in checkpoint class, distance is lenght between bot and checkpoinyt
 Maxim251: or create new class, and stor it there?
 Maxim251: for calendar problem, maybe it helps <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/211937-calendar-program-problem-in-c/">https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/211937-calendar-program-problem-in-c/</a>
 YurkovAS: calc distance when you need it, 
 YurkovAS: for csb i'm use distance in eval function only, don't store it
 Maxim251: #YurkovAS Thank You. thats make sense.
 YurkovAS: but i'm bad coder: write in "c with classes" style, without oop, inheritance, new and other
 Maxim251: Yeah, I go straight to deep water, I start in C++ , But first steps was like in C. OOP is for me interested, because some things I can brace in parts, like in C using struct, I can describe some real word obiects , and I dont need to worry abut names colisions
 Maxim251: #YurkovAS  bad coder, and GURU?
 Maxim251: Oh, I wish to be in so high place, to be 0.1%

 struct: so entire cpu?
 struct: not only 1 core?
 Maxim251: Wow, super, I start to read it... At least I have nice example how construct classes, what functionality is nice to brake in seperaste clases. And I see that You use inheritance for point... 
 YurkovAS: but Unique strings v2 - 3 CPU
 struct: ah, my solution was only using 1 core / thread
 YurkovAS: use mmap from wiki<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Highload-fun/platform/wiki/How-to-use-MMAP-to-optimize-data-reading">https://github.com/Highload-fun/platform/wiki/How-to-use-MMAP-to-optimize-data-reading</a>

 YurkovAS: i'm without avx in Parse integers
 struct: only 1 core?

 Maxim251: Its looks so simmilar.
 Maxim251: Anyway, I am happy for that example. thank You
 YurkovAS: Maxim251 yes, use it for simulation. But with smitsimax search algo<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax</a>
 Maxim251: I dont care about simulation, for now for me is too advanced, but example of inheritance and composition, thats what I want to train with. 
 Maxim251: xv and vy its the last pos of bot? And is used to calculate velocity? or speed?
 YurkovAS: i'm recommend use GA algo (as in example) for first. You can reach 50+ with it
 struct: Maxim251 you get more inputs in gold
 struct: you get all checkpoints on first turn and the velocity of the pods
 Maxim251: If I will fill stronger with desighning classes, and composition, then I will go level higher. Problem wit me is that I alwas make mess in one of the classes, because I cant brake functions acording to the class. Your example looks good, like I should make.
 struct: OOP can be tricky at the start
 BobLob: I'm getting language assist interruptions.  Is that on my side or is it sitewide?
 darkhorse64: A good starting point is to consider that a class contains the data it is responsible for and that its method deals with that data. In this respect, a pod will never contain the list of checkpoints
 jzen: BobLob: I am getting it too
 BobLob: ok, thanks for the information.  I'll take a break for a while and check back later.

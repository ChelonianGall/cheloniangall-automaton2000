 Putnam3145: well, the principle is, surely
 Andriamanitra: whoever made the security check system for clashes must not be the sharpest tool in the shed
 Andriamanitra: oh you completed a captcha 3 minutes ago? better make sure you haven't turned into a robot!
 Andriamanitra: i've solved 3 captchas in the last 10 minutes it feels like i'm being used
 jacek: thats part of the challenge: make captcha solving bot
 zile151: i never had to pass a security check until today tho
 eulerscheZahl: captchas start appearing when you play too many clashes in a row
 Andriamanitra: i have no clue what the logic is, some days i don't get any security checks and some days i get captcha EVERY. SINGLE. CLASH.
 eulerscheZahl: there used to be some users who cheated at CoC by using bots. that's why
 Allis: There's probably some sort of reset that doesn't align with your time zone.
 Allis: I understand why the captcha exists, but it could definitely be less heavy-handed.
 Allis: eulerscheZahl, have you considered moving away from Heroku for your thing?
 Allis: The dyno spindown is brutal.
 eulerscheZahl: but it's free :P
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even mind paying a few euros. it's more the process of buying a server. usually needs paypal or a credit card
 jrke: is flask free?
 Andriamanitra: can anyone explain wtf is going on with last two test cases of clash "Message packet"?
 eulerscheZahl: yes jrke
 jrke: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: Andriamanitra quoting Boulet here:"Please avoid any utf8 char here. Not all languages can deal with them."
 eulerscheZahl: i guess that's your issue
 Andriamanitra: the problem statement explicitly said it's ASCII characters
 eulerscheZahl: I would edit the last testcase+validator to avoid UTF8but i don't have the permission :D
 eulerscheZahl: i used to have. then moderation rules for clashes changed and i haven't participated 300 times yet
 Allis: Andriamanitra, for what it's worth, Ruby makes that super-easy to handle.
 Allis: `""&lt;&lt;codepoint` instead of `codepoint.chr`.
 Andriamanitra: good to know
 Allis: It implicitly uses the encoding of the empty string, which'll be UTF-8 on any modern Ruby.
 eulerscheZahl: still a poor clash design IMO
 Andriamanitra: yeah i might've even figured out what the problem is if it didn't say output should be ascii representation of the message
 Allis: I find the "players loose" more objectionable than the ¾, but it's clearly a little unfair.
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even read that
 jrke: is there any tool to play several matches without submitting
 Putnam3145: matches of what?
 Andriamanitra: btw eulerscheZahl your site tries to load css over http and browsers like to block mixed content
 Andriamanitra: i only just found out what the site is supposed to look like, there was even a link to codingame that's not visible when the css doesn't load :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: huh? load for me
 eulerscheZahl: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/themes/base/jquery-ui.css">http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/themes/base/jquery-ui.css</a>"&gt;
 Andriamanitra: yup
 jrke: can i  not create code golf
 Allis: Are you asking whether you can make your Clash contribution eligible for shortest mode?
 jrke: nope code golf
 Allis: ...
 jrke: like temperatures
 Allis: You're not communicating very clearly.&#160;:/
 jrke: code golf game 
 jrke: not shortest mode clash
 Allis: Same thing.
 jrke: no
 Allis: Oh, right. I see how you mean.
 jrke: clash is other thing
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf/temperature-code-golf">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf/temperature-code-golf</a>
 AnonymousM: hi
 Allis: It does seem that that's not an option, which is a little strange.
 Allis: Maybe any "in/out" puzzle can moonlight as a golf challenge?

 Allis: Clashing with Haksell puts my heart rate in the triple digits. :sweat_smile:
 KF_Kenny: Haskell is a great language
 KF_Kenny: but not for shortest unfortunately lol
 Andriamanitra: i really like the features haskell has but i hate the way you have to write it
 Andriamanitra: the syntax is extremely counter-intuitive for me
 Allis: Andriamanitra, ever seen this madness? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gist.github.com/404pnf/6017155">https://gist.github.com/404pnf/6017155</a>
 KF_Kenny: I think haskell syntax is quite close to math once you get used to things like currying and using spaces for functional application. And then there is also all those weird looking operators like $, &lt;*&gt; 
 KF_Kenny: I still like it more than python
 KF_Kenny: unfortunately I can't win any shortest contests with haskell so python will have to do
 iamart: where can I find shortest contensts?
 AntiSquid: TeccTanClaw see channel #clash , it's dedicated to clash invites
 Andriamanitra: i'd be lying if i said i understand what's going on there Allis
 Allis: It's an attempt to bring Haskell's list comprehension syntax to Ruby.
 Allis: But it relies on all sorts of hackiness that makes it unusable in production, plus Ruby's Enumerable is already really nice anyway.
 Andriamanitra: ah, that is indeed madness :smile:
 _-: @Allis Clashing with Haksell puts my heart rate in the triple digits. :sweat_smile: Same as we playing you
 Allis: Now I know how it feels. He is so freaking good.
 Allis: Just absolutely demolishes me most of the time.
 JakeCubes: I am just trying to do CoC in Java for the first time after doing a Codecademy course having always done CoC in Python
 JakeCubes: It is ... very difficult
 Allis: A fellow cuber?
 _-: One time I saw you defeating him easily lol May be that feeling might be mutual
 Allis: I manage to get a win off him every now and then, but it's always nerve-wracking. But I think that's when it's most fun.&#160;:)
 minhduc71ct: are you coder
 MustangEco: hello, i'm in wood1 spring challenge. There are alot of pacs so how to calculate all shortest routs of all pacs?
 jrke: By any pathfinder you can find shortest path
 jrke: as well as distance
 MustangEco: how to store all of it
 jacek: good afternoon
 eulerscheZahl: happy Caturday
 MSmits: hi
 MSmits: it's friday
 eulerscheZahl: wait, what? :scream:
 MSmits: go to work, fast!
 eulerscheZahl: just kidding, took off 2 weeks
 MSmits: already lost track of time huh
 MSmits: little over a week till school starts
 MSmits: really wondering what it'll be like
 eulerscheZahl: and for how long
 MSmits: corona surging a bit because of stupid people
 eulerscheZahl: this will keep going for a long time
 MSmits: also newest research shows the kids I am teaching spread the virus just as easily as adult
 MSmits: so maybe it'll be half filled classes or something like that
 eulerscheZahl: they just got a harder lockdown (closed schools) affecting the stats
 MSmits: with partial online
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds weird to teach for you
 MSmits: what do you mean
 MSmits: it's weird yes, i did it for 2 weeks
 eulerscheZahl: at some point i heard about the theory of kids being less likely to spread the disease
 eulerscheZahl: but statistical bias, they just had less social contacts
 MSmits: yeah makes sense
 MSmits: also because they show so little symptoms, there is not much data
 MSmits: there wasnt much testing capacity, they would only test people going to the hospital
 MSmits: basically, if school happens as normal, the teachers are the people who are screwed
 MSmits: and every grandpa of those students
 MSmits: and grandma
 Astrobytes: Locking down parts of Scotland because of a***holes going on pub crawls etc, after being at restaurants etc
 MSmits: I had one colleague that sent out an e-mail to suggest placing those see through screens in front of our desks
 MSmits: i think that's pointless
 MSmits: Astrobytes same everywhere
 MSmits: young people and dumb people, or both
 Astrobytes: Daft isn't it
 eulerscheZahl: always a few people ruining it for everyone
 MSmits: not so few though
 eulerscheZahl: not only corona. you can even see that on CG: captchas for clashers
 Astrobytes: They're prioritising getting the kids back to school now over restaurants etc. I can't see it going well, for all the reasons you point out
 MSmits: if it was a few, there would be no problem by definition
 MSmits: well it's a good priority
 MSmits: kids &gt; restaurants
 MSmits: but classes of 30 is not gonna go well
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just  that the teachers are gonna be in the s**t up to their necks
 MSmits: some of us are old too
 MSmits: I have many colleagues over 60
 Astrobytes: Yeah. We've got teachers who a technically still "shielding" (staying at home) being forced to go back to the classroom, without PPE etc. Totally irresponsible
 Astrobytes: (at risk teachers that is, underlying health issues, age etc)
 MSmits: masks would help, but it seems impossible to me to get all those kids wearing them
 MSmits: and if just the teacher is wearing them it's only marginally helpful
 Astrobytes: yep
 MSmits: also he/she's the one that's talking and will be hard to understand
 Astrobytes: Maybe distance/electronic learning should be the way forward. Minimal classroom/lecture time
 MSmits: I think so yes
 MSmits: if you can perfect it, you can do with 1 hr a week contact time
 Astrobytes: But governments need to recognise this and modernise appropriately
 MSmits: problem is that most teachers are not very good at it yet
 MSmits: also it works poorly for young students
 MSmits: and their parents need to go to work
 Astrobytes: Yep. On both counts
 Astrobytes: I think we've reached a point where education needs to change as well as the workplace, working hours, flexibility etc
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: btw, I've always struggled with deciding to stay home or not when I've caught a cold. Some people will not accept this when you do
 MSmits: I guess that's over now...
 MSmits: teaching with a cold is particularly nasty
 jacek: yay for covid for changing perspective of remote working/teaching
 Astrobytes: For sure. I went to my cheffing jobs regardless, no choice. You need a death certificate to get out of that
 MSmits: jacek agreed
 Astrobytes: Got sent home with swine flu once, that was it
 Astrobytes: Yes jacek
 MSmits: so you're making food while carrying disease... awesome
 MSmits: that's why we all go to restaurants, to pick up viruses...
 Astrobytes: Yep&#160;:)
 MSmits: if i know the chef has a cold, i will stay at home
 MSmits: their screwing over their customers
 MSmits: they're
 jacek: the problem with remote teaching would be youngest students, teachers not knowing how to use stuff, and students who cant afford extra computer/tablet if used by other family member
 MSmits: that's true JakeCubes
 MSmits: huh
 Astrobytes: Yeah we were just talking about that jacek. And yep, governments need to be ready to support families and teachers alike
 MSmits: who the hell is JakeCubes
 Astrobytes: donno but you pinged him
 MSmits: it appears so
 jacek: im antisocial anyway, so except for wearing mask, nothing changed for me :v
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: except for work that is
 Astrobytes: Yep
 eulerscheZahl: that's why we spend our time here on CG
 eulerscheZahl: being antisocial
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: yay for antisocial
 jacek: well i was forced to remote work for 3 months, and it will be probably back for the fall
 Astrobytes: Sociably antisocial
 jacek: well, not 'forced' per se
 eulerscheZahl: i'm remote-working for almost 4 months now.not sure when i will return
 dbdr: the real antisocal people don't even chat on CG
 MSmits: good point
 Astrobytes: I'm remote working for this job anyway, regardless of Covid. Not sure what's gonna happen with the conservation centre, we rely a lot on group visits, tours, activities etc
 eulerscheZahl: others dragged me into the chat, they pinged me first
 jacek: Automaton2000 or AutomatonNN?
 Automaton2000: he does not like it
 AutomatonNN: ideal didn't find it
 dbdr: you must have chatted before you got pinged
 eulerscheZahl: i think it was during GitC that I got active on the chat
 MSmits: at least Automaton2000 knows you dont like it eulerscheZahl
 Automaton2000: but i would still be the same for the opponent
 dbdr: really?
 eulerscheZahl: was doing quite well, that gives you attention
 dbdr: they pinged you because of your results?
 eulerscheZahl: i was first for a long time
 eulerscheZahl: afk lunchtime
 MSmits: I started chatting here I think because I was always asking for help 
 Astrobytes: You started chatting during Code Royale, same as me
 MSmits: Robo inoryy and euler mostly helping me out
 MSmits: and I think marchete
 dbdr: they regret it now&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 MSmits: :grin:
 dbdr: I remember reading about engines and sims during meanmax contest
 dbdr: that was all new to me in this context
 dbdr: *in the chat
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I didn't have the foggiest idea what was going on during CR. Sim this, search that.
 MSmits: yeah me neither, well, i figured it out during the contest
 MSmits: got a halfway decent flight sim for the queen
 Astrobytes: Yup. Then after the contest I went full-on research mode
 MSmits: dbdr what about engines btw?
 MSmits: i dont hear that word much
 Astrobytes: the game engine
 MSmits: like the referee?
 dbdr: yeah, similar to sim really
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: i guess the jargon changed
 Astrobytes: engine being the game mechanics really
 MSmits: I see
 dbdr: I remember reading M*gus article about csb and finding it strange he was basically reimplementing the referee
 dbdr: from the software engineering point of view, seems like duplication of effort
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: to me that was completely natural, I was always reverse engineering game mechanics for minmaxing, even before  I could code
 MSmits: i would make excel tools and such
 dbdr: minmaxing without coding? :thinking:
 MSmits: minmaxing has a different meaning in gaming
 dbdr: oh
 Astrobytes: maximising skills/traits etc
 MSmits: it's basically knowing the game formulas so you can optimize gameplay
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I would make attack calculators for browser games and such
 Astrobytes: As an ex Diablo player, I get that
 dbdr: yeah, did some of that too&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah yeah diablo is a good example
 MSmits: i didnt do it for that one, but mostly for online strategy games
 jacek: nerds
 MSmits: :nerd:
 dbdr: :nerd:
 Astrobytes: :nerd:
 jacek: and i see ive been outclasses in othello :F
 MSmits: I just changed 1 line of code jacek, to be honest
 jacek: no ntuples yet? :scream:
 MSmits: nope
 dbdr: wow, gg!
 MSmits: I don't like to be sneaky though
 MSmits: so I'll just tell you right here I counterbooked all of you
 jacek: manually?
 MSmits: book war part I
 dbdr: 4 games out of 5 I looked were 33/31
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: manually
 jacek: meh
 dbdr: suspicious&#160;:)
 MSmits: my bot still does 50/50/40/10% winrate vs robo/tri trac/dbdr/jacek
 MSmits: without book
 MSmits: jacek is particularly painful to counterbook btw
 jacek: i would rather learn how to automatically generate book than hardcoding ones for opponents
 MSmits: i am also automatically generating it
 dbdr: ask MSmits&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's just too slow
 MSmits: I am impatient
 dbdr: I just implemented basic minimax in Go
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: that seems very hard
 MSmits: well not the minimax
 MSmits: but any sensible heuristics
 dbdr: it's not hard to do&#160;;)
 dbdr: just hard to make good
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: well for me it's breakthrough first
 dbdr: there is no really strong bot yet I think
 Andriamanitra: in ruby there's a golf-y way to map keys from array into corresponding values in a hash right? i can't remember the syntax and google is not helping me
 dbdr: must be google conspiring to promote go&#160;;)
 MSmits: I see, wonder what'll happen on go. Is it easy to steal  google a bot and adapt to CG? 
 dbdr: (sorry, I don't know much ruby)
 MSmits: same Andriamanitra
 dbdr: it's not the same game. atari go
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: whats different
 Andriamanitra: ah,  hash.values_at(arr)
 dbdr: atari only counts captures
 dbdr: go is about territory
 MSmits: oh I see
 MSmits: so empties dont count
 dbdr: more or less
 dbdr: I'm no expert at go
 MSmits: never played it
 jacek: how fast is 19x19 sim?
 jacek: do you bitboard it
 MSmits: crappy numbers for bitboard
 dbdr: I do bitboard
 jacek: and well, im gonna be prepared in breakthrough
 MSmits: prepared for what jacek?
 jacek: for you
 MSmits: you mean in case I do a book?:
 MSmits: not sure it's viable to do a book there
 MSmits: early branching is enormous
 jacek: in case you make bot
 jacek: i made some improvements lately
 MSmits: oh did you do a NN?
 dbdr: go is even worse for book, I think
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: useless on go
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: thats cool jacek
 dbdr: there's actually a variant of go on a torus
 MSmits: you're getting good at this
 dbdr: which is clever
 dbdr: no special case for borders
 jacek: i wish there were separate accessible leagues for go different sizes
 dbdr: so there is only one first move&#160;:)
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: like othello
 dbdr: tere is othello on a torus?
 dbdr: *there
 MSmits: no but there is only 1 move, as you know :P
 dbdr: should we release Go 9x9 as a separate game?
 dbdr: ah yes
 dbdr: might make sense, esp on CG with the short response time
 dbdr: is that what you meant jacek?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: that's what I thought when i saw the contribution tests
 MSmits: ohh go 9x9, perfect for CG
 dbdr: I was thinking of atari go 9x9
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: which would be a trivial job&#160;:)
 dbdr: and I need a contibution&#160;;)
 MSmits: should probably ask the creator
 Astrobytes: ^
 dbdr: yeah
 Astrobytes: I think he'll be fine with it
 dbdr: I also wonder if there is a problem of having too many games
 Astrobytes: Nope.
 MSmits: I do too :P
 MoharSUr: HELLO
 jacek: lets ask struct
 Astrobytes: The more the merrier imo
 MSmits: they need to make categories though
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MoharSUr: WAT IS LINKED LIST&#160;????
 dbdr: right, categories is a good idea
 jacek: i think there are too many board games anyway
 dbdr: also, making sure of good quality
 MSmits: it's a string in all caps MoharSUr
 Astrobytes: I think there should be a board games category, some people can't get enough board games
 MSmits: yes, should be separate
 Astrobytes: It's a niche
 MSmits: it's a really different experience
 dbdr: yeah, maybe less fun for beginners
 Astrobytes: It would be interesting to see some other new games, but it seems the only people making any are into board games
 dbdr: harder to do heuristics, and less "exotic"
 MSmits: I think so, you really need a search algortihm
 MSmits: Astrobytes other games generally require more art
 MSmits: = more work
 MSmits: animations and such
 dbdr: art can be found online
 Astrobytes: JBM can take care of that, or euler&#160;:)
 MSmits: still though, compare referee sizes
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: PCR = 2k, average board game a few 100 lines at most
 MSmits: and PCR is a simple game
 dbdr: isn't PCR the one with two engines, only one of them being used?
 MSmits: I guess the physics makes it big
 dbdr: two different collision methods
 MSmits: yeah, but the unused code is not that big
 MSmits: it's mostly that phyiscs requires a lot of vector stuff
 MSmits: many many methods
 dbdr: right, but that's not super hard and you can reuse that
 MSmits: true, but I think it scares people
 jacek: physics is scary
 MSmits: for some 
 dbdr: well, if you do heuristics it matters less
 dbdr: physics teachers are scary&#160;;)
 MSmits: i mean as a creator
 dbdr: ah
 MSmits: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: jacek 12:42PMlets ask struct
 MSmits: do you think maybe he changed identity again?.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, maybe he's been clashing 24/7 under a new ID
 eulerscheZahl: he might got run over by a bus without us knowingi have no idea
 MSmits: let's hope not =/
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I do hope he's OK. He does disappear though.
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait until someone suggests to use the intel debugger for C++
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: then odds are high that we found him again
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: or even if not, someone close enough 
 mikitosina1: Ребят, всем привет! Стало интересно, а есть вообще в ascii баква "хуй"?  Прошу прощения за мат.
 eulerscheZahl: go to #ru
 eulerscheZahl: i fear i scared him off with the JS part of my game
 MSmits: is that the secret game?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: ok
 eulerscheZahl: i'll wait till thibaud is back from holidays and start harassing him&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Hopefully that goes well! I miss a summer contest
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355</a>
 dbdr: I asked the question about 9x9 atari
 field3: Atari Go is for Go beginners and is often called "ponnuki igo" in Japanese.Wikipedia introduces the technique of Go in "List of Go terms".:relaxed:
 dbdr: feel free to up/downvote and discuss
 dbdr: does ponnuki mean capture?
 jrke: there is a puzzle also a game of go on cg
 eulerscheZahl: we know
 dbdr: field3: nice python bot in go
 dbdr: defending the japanese colors&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: "A Ponnuki is worth 30 points"
 Astrobytes: - Go proverb
 dbdr: My little Ponnuki
 field3: Is it the meaning of taking lightly in Japanese?
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 dbdr: ah, ponnuki is called oeil in french (eye)
 Astrobytes: "The word ponnuki (ポン抜き) breaks up into pon and nuki, in which pon is supposedly the imaginary sound of a stone being captured, while nuki means "taking out" (noun)."
 dbdr: nukes also do that&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Yeah dbdr, it's referring to the diamond shaped formations you get
 dbdr: is eye used in english for go?
 eulerscheZahl: Onomatopoeia, nice
 Astrobytes: yep
 dbdr: that article does not mention it
 Astrobytes: you have an eye in the four stone capture, and you aim to get 2 eyes in other formations
 field3: I'm coding a bit of "Tesuji".There are various ways to put stones together.
 dbdr: field3: so you recognize patterns? no search?
 Astrobytes: Yes, I watched some of your games and saw you are using some techniques
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Tesuji">https://senseis.xmp.net/?Tesuji</a>
 Astrobytes: There are many different strategies and tactics one can use
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile the next board game is pending already: dots and boxes
 Astrobytes: Just looking at that now
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen it before. in the real world
 SPDene: I log on and find my language is set to scala. "what the heck did I do last night??" :P
 eulerscheZahl: you were golfing power of thor
 SPDene: probably that too
 Astrobytes: There cannot be any other explanation
 eulerscheZahl: or someone stole your loginwhatever is more likely
 SPDene: nah - I was getting achievments
 field3: Python doesn't work for read ahead.Counting open locations is equivalent to read ahead.
 Astrobytes: Interesting
 eulerscheZahl: CG sponsored, A*Craft, CGFunge, Number shifting, rubiks cube, 1 puzzle in golf+normal mode
 Astrobytes: Speaking of golf, I managed to claw my way up to 34th somehow
 eulerscheZahl: 60th at least
 eulerscheZahl: and for one puzzle there is a published solution shorter than my own best in pythonwould feel shabby to submit it&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I'll do more on Sunday, Sunday is golf day for me these days
 eulerscheZahl: but for chuck norris i took inspiration at least
 Astrobytes: I like golfing languages I have no idea about. It's awful yet strangely fun.
 jrke: i can't golf my ruby more in temperature&#160;:(
 MSmits: I spent some time googling golf tips and found a lot of weird languages where you can code programs with 5 characters
 eulerscheZahl: like golfscript2?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, golfing langs are very strange
 MSmits: not sure what they're called euler
 MSmits: it just looked weird
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/hvm/">http://www.hacker.org/hvm/</a>that one gave me a hard time
 field3: I did about 20 pattern recognitions, including some that didn't seem to be useful.:slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: run this on the link above:

 dbdr: yay, #1 in D&amp;B :D
 MSmits: whats that?
 MSmits: Death and Beyond?
 jrke: D&amp;B?
 MSmits: Dishes and Bathwater?
 Astrobytes: Drum &amp; Bass
 dbdr: oh, we need Dots and Boxes: Death and Reincarnation
 jrke: oh new bot programming WIP
 Astrobytes: D B D R lol
 MSmits: hehe
 jrke: :smiley:
 jrke: DB&amp;DR 1ST IN D&amp;B&#160;:)
 dbdr: not a single defeat
 MSmits: i havent even played Eric's last game yet&#160;!
 Astrobytes: twixt?
 MSmits: was on my list for a while
 MSmits: I like it. Notoriously hard to write a bot for
 eulerscheZahl: "was"?it disappeared from your list?
 dbdr: which one, twixt?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: well, too much else to do
 dbdr: why is it hard?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't like crossing lines?
 MSmits: because a human can see easily what to play, most of the time, but it's hard to formulate rules to capture that 
 MSmits: right euler&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's  a bit like go i think, twixt
 MSmits: many options, but not many that make sense
 dbdr: D&amp;B looks very similar visually
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: oh that game
 dbdr: damn, looks like ppl have real bots in league 2
 MSmits: mmh this one is in danger of being solvable maybe
 MSmits: not sure
 MSmits: depends on how big the field is
 dbdr: 7x7
 MSmits: not that big
 MSmits: well it's probably weakly solvable at most
 MSmits: It's probably possible to mathematically prove many moves are bad and prune them, but that doesn't mean the opponent can't still play them
 MSmits: I'm gonna be interested in this game  
 MSmits: 7*8 + 7*8 = 112 moves
 MSmits: nah, it's fine
 dbdr: probably like othello, fewer andn fewer legal moves as game progresses
 jrke: but if opponent plays pruned moves then it will be bad choice by opponent
 jacek: 7x7? w00t
 jacek: i think something like 3x4 or maybe 4x5 was solved
 field3: 7ｘ7ｘ4
 jacek: x 4?
 field3: UDLR　4
 jacek: and the game board makes that black dots illussion
 eulerscheZahl: 8*8*4 isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: as all borders can be marked
 MSmits: hmm no
 MSmits: you got 8 * 7 verticals
 eulerscheZahl: right
 MSmits: 8*7 horizontals
 MSmits: 112
 MSmits: 8*8*4 double counts some
 eulerscheZahl: left side of one cell is the same as right side of the neighbor
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: also dbdr it's different from Othello as Othello diverges, then converges again
 MSmits: it's more like yavalath, starts with the maximum amount of moves, then converges
 dbdr: right
 Astrobytes: lol, just realised it's my birthday
 MSmits: congrats&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Only realised when my sister called me
 MSmits: I always forget also until someone tells me
 Astrobytes: easily done!
 eulerscheZahl: madknight always told us when it was his birthday
 eulerscheZahl: his is in January
 Astrobytes: So he wouldn't forget?
 eulerscheZahl: just waiting for congratulations
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'm also more on the forgetting the own birthday side
 Astrobytes: I fail to see the point of celebrating
 Astrobytes: I stopped celebrating at 30
 eulerscheZahl: well done you managed to survive another year without dying
 Astrobytes: Only just
 field3: I had a feeling that the A7-R and the B7-L were different, but it is a mistake.:wink:
 Astrobytes: I prefer to think of it as "one year closer to death"
 eulerscheZahl: one more year of physical decay
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: on more year of XP
 Astrobytes: Far too optimistic viewpoint for me :P
 dbdr: how's your XP/age ratio evolving over time?
 field3: happy Birthday.This is the song I was listening to while I was making the go program while frustrated.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kff_DXor7jc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kff_DXor7jc</a>
 MSmits: why are people posting opening books in the comments?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/RCXqKZ.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/RCXqKZ.jpg</a>when in doubt, ask eulerscheZahl :D
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: lol, quite well I guess dbdr!
 Astrobytes: Thank you field3&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: MSmits, hahaha well played
 MSmits: nice song though
 Astrobytes: Definitely your kind of song
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: MSmits: it's steganography
 MSmits: now you're just making up words
 dbdr: like when spies were communicating by publishing code words in minor newspaper articles
 Astrobytes: Steganography is real
 MSmits: ahhh I see
 Astrobytes: Nowadays it's still hiding data in other data, images, sound files, documents, executables
 MSmits: I'll watch my othello games to see if any swastikas appear
 MSmits: thanks for warning
 dbdr: you can hide data in moves of your cg bot
 dbdr: those are in Tower Dereference
 MSmits: ohh
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl had to add filtering to remove them from random maps
 MSmits: you're serious?
 dbdr: yep
 MSmits: that's so funn
 MSmits: y
 Astrobytes: The maps are swastika shaped?
 dbdr: maps are symmetrical
 Astrobytes: *were
 dbdr: yes
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: I can imagine him going over all the possible swastika shaped maps to filter them
 MSmits: ohhh no not another one
 dbdr: not sure how he does it, need to check the referee
 MSmits: wait... does the referee now have hardcoded swastikas?
 Astrobytes: if (swastika) continue;
 Astrobytes: The code is shaped like that MSmits
 MSmits: it would be even funnier if, in an effort to fix his game, he ended up with a referee with a whole list of filtered swastikas :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: :D
 Uljahn: make a white list of approved maps and sample from it
 Astrobytes: "white list" :smirk:
 Uljahn: jeez
 Astrobytes: Very appropriate in this context :D
 Uljahn: ye, my bad. how do you call it in politically correct way?
 Astrobytes: No idea
 dbdr: there were suggestions like passlist, acceptlist
 dbdr: vs blocklist
 SPDene: blocked list /  allowed list&#160;?
 Astrobytes: works for me
 Uljahn: thx
 Astrobytes: bad list/good list
 dbdr: naughty list
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: that's a good point for the change, it's more fun :D
 Astrobytes: definitely
 MSmits: all these board games with black vs white are a minefield of possible racism
 dbdr: they don't have a notion of good/bad, do they?
 MSmits: no i mean
 dbdr: apart from who starts
 MSmits: it's easy to say the wrong thing
 dbdr: but it's not always good to stat
 dbdr: ah yes&#160;:)
 MSmits: when talking about it
 dbdr: capture the whites
 Kacper_D: "all these board games with black vs white are a minefield of possible racism" - funniest thing I've heard today
 MSmits: as you see here... white is superior, ehh has a superior position to black here...
 Uljahn: not in go
 MSmits: how so
 dbdr: on a specific board I think
 Uljahn: in go black is to move first and white has komi
 MSmits: komi?
 dbdr: commie?
 MSmits: lol...
 Astrobytes: like a handicap awarded for certain positions that black takes
 Uljahn: ye
 Astrobytes: to balance the advantage
 MSmits: why not just use pie rule?
 dbdr: isn't it to compensate for starting advatage?
 Uljahn: dbdr yes
 Astrobytes: yes
 dbdr: not sure any position is negative
 MSmits: oh there is no balanced position?
 MSmits: to start?
 MSmits: it's perfect for yavalath, seems quite a few balanced positions
 Uljahn: they said most balanced position for the first move is between 3-3 and 2-3 :smiley:
 dbdr: the pie rule: I pick a position, and if you're not happy you can smash a pie in my face as compensation
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: Uljahn 3-3 in go?
 MSmits: dbdr exactly, works well
 Uljahn: ye
 MSmits: ah ok, cuz 2-3 in yavalath is balanced, but 3-3 is solved
 Uljahn: 3-3 is considerd more agressive and 2-3 less
 MSmits: is this balanced including komi&#160;?
 MSmits: or balanced without the komi
 Uljahn: with komi ofc
 MSmits: what i meant is, are there any balanced moves without komi
 MSmits: or are all starts advantageous
 MSmits: meaning you always need compensation
 Uljahn: there is an explicit handicap for balancing levels of players - additional stones
 Uljahn: on board
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?Komi">https://senseis.xmp.net/?Komi</a>
 dbdr: found a map:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/pv08u4">https://prnt.sc/pv08u4</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?PieRule">https://senseis.xmp.net/?PieRule</a>
 MSmits: pie rule in go 
 Astrobytes: Rarely used though
 MSmits: yea apparently
 dbdr: &gt; "One player chooses komi, the other one chooses sides." (Fair Komi &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://senseis.xmp.net/?FairKomi">https://senseis.xmp.net/?FairKomi</a>&gt;) guarantees jigo for perfect play. 
 dbdr: I don't think that's true
 dbdr: if jigo means draw
 MSmits: pie rule doesnt guarantee a draw no
 MSmits: it only garantees a draw if at least one starting move is solved as a draw
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: for games that are nowhere near solvable and that you can't detect any imbalance in the most balanced starting moves, it doesn't matter though
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: &gt; A possible alternative is that if both agree on the same value then nigiri can be done.
 FLQ4: how can i convert from binary to decimal in python
 MSmits: pie rule would be great for uttt
 dbdr: isn't nigiri food?
 FLQ4: like a string of binary to number 
 MSmits: so they dont get dinner if they dont agree?
 dbdr: looks like the first step to learn Go is to learn Japanese :D
 Andriamanitra: int("101010",2)
 FLQ4: thanks
 dbdr: nigiri pie
 MSmits: I bet many serious go players do learn japanese
 dbdr: might be a lot of litterature too
 dbdr: though I think it's also super popular in Korea and China
 dbdr: so better learn all 3 languages
 dbdr: and Go in your next life
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: One player chooses komi, the other one chooses sides,.... this does guarantee a solved draw though if both players do this perfectly
 MSmits: because without komi, when both players play perfectly, there is a net score
 MSmits: say +2 
 MSmits: then the perfect komi would be 2
 MSmits: and since you can choose sides, it would be a draw
 dbdr: even without choosing sides
 dbdr: if both play perfectly
 dbdr: it does not matter which side you play&#160;;)
 MSmits: if the komi is set correctly
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: so you're and they were right, thanks!
 MSmits: np&#160;:)
 dbdr: there is a scene in Futurerama: Bender and Fry sit down to play chess.Bender announces mat in 73 moves
 MSmits: funny

 dbdr: yeah
 JBM: "black/white"
 dbdr: i have a shorter mate up my sleeve&#160;;)
 dbdr: chess
 dbdr: mate
 dbdr: solved
 JBM: white wins again
 JBM: coincidence?
 dbdr: "no poo"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: was afk for a bit, i guess i'm late now: i don't filter any maps for tower dereference
 dbdr: right, could not find the commit

 field3: Isn't 9x9 the most played game on the net? I also only do 9x9. 19x19 hasn't been in a long time.:slight_smile:
 dbdr: no idea, but it gets harder. only the beginning seemed very simple, also because so many moves were symmetrical
 dbdr: this is a beginner video, right?
 field3: I checked it, but it is for beginners.

 MSmits: wlesavo spooned me
 Astrobytes: :o

 Astrobytes: that's going in my profile some day
 Washier: haha
 MSmits: :P
 Hjax: wow grats smits
 MSmits: thanks, did not change much about my bot though, I just put in book moves
 MSmits: it's still quite beatable
 MSmits: I did the same in yavalath, but that bot is much harder to beat
 AntiSquid: what game?
 MSmits: Othello
 dbdr: MSmits ad wlesavo, get a room&#160;;)
 dbdr: *and
 MSmits: lol
 wlesavo: MSmits would you prefer to be a big spoon or a little one? :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: for perfect spooning both need the same size
 dbdr: not according to the expression
 Astrobytes: listen to eulerscheLöffel
 Washier: hehehehe
 Washier: i find that if the spoonee is smaller than the spooner, its more intimate
 MSmits: :spoon:
 SPDene: if spooner is involved, would it be "or mintimate" :P

 Astrobytes: Only if you shout it Washier
 eulerscheZahl: don't you get between me and Thibaud before i had a chance to pitch my idea :rage:
 Astrobytes: You already made Löffelspiel?
 dbdr: we guessed it by complete accident?
 Washier: like Lindemann
 dbdr: improbability drive!
 AntiSquid: ok chat is weird, people talking about spooning each other Automaton2000 do something&#160;:/
 Automaton2000: i did not think of that
 Washier: i come here every Friday this time for the chat
 Washier: like a very weird soap
 Astrobytes: Lindemann as in Till?
 Washier: yass
 Washier: Löffelspiel
 dbdr: AntiSquid: would be quicker to mention when chat is *not* weird
 eulerscheZahl: spammers are the "normal" part of this chat
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: idk i am sure there are usually healthy conversations
 Astrobytes: We were talking about Go earlier, and field 3 gave us a bunch of videos in Japanese to help us out. That was a healthy convo
 Washier: i followed it. yes.
 Astrobytes: Especially since we don't see field in world chat much
 AntiSquid: who is field
 Astrobytes: field 3
 AntiSquid: ya, still don't remember that user
 AntiSquid: too often away from chat drama i guess

 PYHAWK: "".join(map(lambda x: 1-x, Input()) )

 MSmits: hmm yeah it's not hard to make something that works
 MSmits: I'm just fussing over the most efficient way, as always
 Astrobytes: Always&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am doing two uint64_t as everyone else probably does
 Astrobytes: Can't knock your methods, seems to work well!
 MSmits: yeah usually
 MSmits: I am trying to decide between one oriëntation
 MSmits: like, p1 is below, p2 is above
 Astrobytes: Oh I see
 MSmits: or do both players from their own perspectiv
 MSmits: like in oware, you are always p1
 MSmits: only in this version of breakthrough both players play as if they are p1
 MSmits: with the same lookup arrays and such
 jacek: this is called 'board inversion'
 MSmits: oh right, I should have known that it is a thing
 MSmits: do you think this is a good idea for breakthrough?
 jacek: smitsiboard
 MSmits: you probably invert it for the NN
 jacek: dunno, i use standard approach for everything
 MSmits: ah I do something different everywhere it seems&#160;:(
 MSmits: partially caused by the different input structure
 MSmits: I tend to build on that
 MSmits: like sometimes, your id is always 0, sometimes you dont even get your id (like in oware(

 MSmits: you can type ast + tab
 Memo12334: you know it increments everytime by 1 extra. It dosnt need to be resetted am i right if its incrementing by 26 for example
 Memo12334: Astrobytes may I know

 Memo12334:&#160;% 26 am I right
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Memo12334: aay ty
 Astrobytes: Have a play around using that and see what you come up with
 dep: wat are u guys making?
 Astrobytes: Noise currently, since my chair has broken
 Astrobytes: Memo is working on a puzzle, I'm giving advice, not sure about anyone else
 dep: interesting :thinking:
 Memo12334: hmm it works now
 Hjax: im at work and just glancing at chat from time to time 
 dep: ooh
 Astrobytes: nice Memo12334 
 dep: playing coders strike back here
 Memo12334: only one encode test case dosnt work , Encode 42
 jacek: and i am tweaking my MLP
 Memo12334: misses 2 loops
 dbdr: jacek, your pic looked like a fraw after one move, was that real?
 dbdr: I only found this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/nov/26/magnus-carlsen-v-fabiano-caruana-world-chess-championship-game-12-live">https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/nov/26/magnus-carlsen-v-fabiano-caruana-world-chess-championship-game-12-live</a>
 Hjax: MLP = my little pony? :P
 jacek: dbdr that was meme from r/AnarchyChess
 dbdr: my little ponnuki
 jacek: carlsen so good he can see draw at move 1
 Astrobytes: ah I remember that match
 dbdr: :D
 Hjax: that match made every fabio fan depressed 
 Hjax: 12 draws and then crushed in rapid 
 Hjax: fabiano*
 dbdr: r/AnarchyChesswhat next?r/CapitalismGo&#160;?
 Hjax: r/chess doesnt allow meme content 
 Astrobytes: r/MarxistShogi
 Hjax: and thus r/anarchychess was born 
 dbdr: yeah, there is r/RustJerk&#160;:)
 dbdr: it's a good thing to split it
 Hjax: the rust subreddit is a really nice place 
 dbdr: yeah
 Hjax: lots of productive discussions 
 dbdr: do you post?
 Hjax: no i just lurk 
 dbdr: yes, and good spirit in general, polite even when disagreeing
 JBM: not enough memes
 dbdr: the few people who tried dissing other programming languages get downvoted to death :D
 dbdr: hence the jerk
 Hjax: from what ive seen everyone who uses rust really likes the language, and from what little rust ive written its easy to see why 
 Hjax: i plan on doing the fall contest in rust 
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 Hjax: i just noticed youre a moderator, is that recent?
 dbdr: I guess also, if you don't love the spirit of the language, you will quit very early because it's different and you need to learn stuff
 Astrobytes: yeah, bunch of use got made mods the other week
 dbdr: so yes, those who continue love it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *us
 dbdr: selection effect
 dep: i should get a profile picture hmm
 Hjax: oooo astro too 
 Hjax: grats both of you 
 dbdr: yes, everyone without a profile pic will be banned one week from now
 Astrobytes: euler as well
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: it was a long time coming for euler especially lol 
 Hjax: hes so active 
 dbdr: especially if they've been member for long
 JBM:&#160;:(
 dbdr: will you think of the loophole?
 Astrobytes: yeah, I recommended euler to Thibaud for that reason Hjax
 JBM: maybe if i read the context
 JBM: oh, got it
 Hjax: join the cat army 
 dep: oh wow i advanced to another league niceeeee
 dep: brb grabbing profile pic
 JBM: you can use mine
 dbdr: ^
 JBM: i don't use it much
 dep: better
 JBM: yeah it's the best one i found
 dep: y my new profile pic is not here
 MSmits: reload
 JBM: fix it
 MSmits: i hovered over your pic, i see the smiley 
 dep: done xd
 dep: looks good man
 MSmits: it's great
 MSmits: true art
 Astrobytes: dep art
 dep: it is hand drawn by me though
 Astrobytes: art dep-o
 MSmits: that sounds better
 MSmits: dep art sounds like you want him gone
 dep: how u do red words-
 MSmits: by saying your name
 MSmits: dep
 MSmits: dep dep
 Astrobytes: It highlights if your name is mentioned dep
 dep: dep
 Astrobytes: dep
 dep: n o
 dep: dep
 dep:&#160;???
 MSmits: you can't do it to yourself
 dep: oh ok
 dep: Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: dep
 MSmits: this is to stop people from talking to themselves
 dep: oh it only appears to other ppl?
 dep: ohhhhhhh
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: Yep dep
 derjack: w00t
 dep: ok bak to working on this fun game hehe
 MSmits: oh noes, the pony is back
 Astrobytes: MSmits your pony video has awoken jacek's alterego
 MSmits: I see it
 derjack: eeyup
 MSmits: derpjack
 derjack: oh i didnt do quest map here
 MSmits: more clickfun
 Astrobytes: I totally misread that 
 MSmits: I'm sure the clashers wont mind being wrecked by a pony 50 times
 Hjax: i always clash in python, doing another language seems scary 
 MSmits: Ruby usually wins
 Astrobytes: No Rust clashes?&#160;:)
 MSmits: do ruby
 JBM: clashing in python sounds scary to me
 Hjax: god rust clashing? thats terrifying 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: not as bad as trying to use java in a code golf one though
 dep: me who clashes in lua:
 LIONSxLEADER: MSmits you use Swift at all?
 Astrobytes: MSwift
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: seems oddly specific
 MSmits: why me and why swift?
 JBM: isn't it obvious?
 MSmits: only to you JBM
 JBM: me and LIONSxLEADER
 MSmits: true
 LIONSxLEADER: indeed, clearly because you are active and not that i saw it (got #1 in othello)
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well I am fairly competent with C# and python
 MSmits: C++ only specifically to this setting
 MSmits: nothing else
 LIONSxLEADER: interesting. i just found this site, and you guy caught my attention while workin on the zombie
 LIONSxLEADER: guys*
 dbdr: reminds me when pb4 (I think) had great difficulty parsing a contest input in C++
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: Welcome to CG LIONSxLEADER&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, I had problems with that in ooc
 MSmits: parsing the c++ input
 MSmits: ye welcome LIONSxLEADER
 Washier: w3lcome
 dbdr: players who can write a top class bot but struggle with beginner tasks
 LIONSxLEADER: interesting. yeah i wanted to get a nice algorithm going before i submitted. 
 Astrobytes: Everyone's a beginner in something
 dbdr: sure, but it's weird in that order
 Hjax: i usually write a python bot first when i start a new contest or multi 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it is&#160;:)
 dep: how that works-
 Hjax: because parsing the input is super easy in python 
 MSmits: that's because doing bots in CG is a very tiny subset of coding
 Hjax: so i can make sure i understand the game 
 Hjax: in the case of pr2, i never stopped using python 
 dbdr: it's like being about to cook a super complex dish but not to boil an egg :D
 MSmits: only  thing I find somewhat challenging in python is getting the input into 2D arrays
 Memo12334: execution speed should matter too
 Astrobytes: Does sometimes, not always
 MSmits: it matters for some things Memo12334
 MSmits: especially for simple board games that have great benefit from millions of simulations
 Astrobytes: Did you solve Enigma Memo12334?
 JBM: pb4 does avx better than input parsing
 Hjax: and then in games like PR2, speed is largely irrelevant 
 MSmits: me too :P
 Memo12334: I had to take a break, just back now lol. I am first trying to solve the encode but Encode 42 doesn't work. It misses 2 loops
 Memo12334: 2 iterations*
 Astrobytes: I'll PM you
 MSmits: euler is great at this input thing right?
 dbdr: JBM exactly
 MSmits: he makes tools to format the json files from replays and such
 dbdr: nothing need to be great at input
 dbdr: sorry: nobody needs to be great at input parsing
 MSmits: well maybe it just doesn't repel him as much as it does me 
 dbdr: can anyone be great at boiling an egg?
 MSmits: you can suck at it though
 dbdr: there's a minimum, but not much to improve after that
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: the heat does most of the work
 LIONSxLEADER: are there any url or api type json request or other web service challenges? 
 MSmits: mmh not exactly, but plenty of string manipulation puzzles
 dbdr: MSmits. reminds me of the joke: all food ingredient list could be replaced wit simply two:- Hydrogen- Time
 MSmits: the heart of CG is mostly in the bot challenges
 Astrobytes: and you can view using the CG API  and parsing the results as a puzzle too
 MSmits: dbdr physics joke, not bad
 Memo12334: Smits are u dutch
 LIONSxLEADER: i always find it interesting that there are no MVVM VIPER or other architechture type challenges
 MSmits: yes Memo12334
 Memo12334: ok me too 
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: we need more Dutch at the top
 dbdr: yeah, happy to make jokes about things I only understand superficially :D
 Memo12334: do you work as a dev
 Hjax: with enough hydrogen and time you dont even have to prepare the food yourself 
 MSmits: i don't Memo12334, before I got to CG i was  a physics teacher
 MSmits: now I also teach Computer science (informatica)
 Memo12334: wow
 Hjax: im a software engineer, but im not as cool as smits 
 MSmits: plenty cool Hjax
 MSmits: I never engineered any real software
 dbdr: what if the amount of time means you'll be dead before the food is cooked?
 dbdr: dead of starvation
 MSmits: then you can't eat it
 dep: im a beginner at coding
 dep: i just got into it last year 
 MSmits: thats cool
 Hjax: ill consider myself cool if i win a contest 
 derjack: or delete account
 Memo12334: Smits how to git gut in physics
 Memo12334: im goign to study EE in September HBO
 dep: i started coding because of roblox ;V
 MSmits: Memo12334 do lots of exercises I guess
 dbdr: get the git gut book
 Astrobytes: Same as most things!
 MSmits: don't just read/watch, solve problems
 MSmits: like you don't get good at soccer, by watching soccer games
 Memo12334: aay good tip
 derjack: and work in vacuum frictionless environment <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/669/">https://xkcd.com/669/</a>
 MSmits: don't be afraid to fail 100 times
 MSmits: and have to look up solutions
 LIONSxLEADER: been coding since 2004 graduated with a 3.95 in robotics and still can't find a steady job as a SDE
 dep: science and math is good
 MSmits: fail, then do the same exercise a week later
 Astrobytes: like organic chemistry, most people think it's too difficult because they don't do enough problems
 MSmits: you forget the answer, but not the method, hopefully
 Hjax: the master has failed more than the beginner has tried 
 Hjax: or something like that 
 Memo12334: gg
 MSmits: yeah
 Memo12334: Smits what level u teach
 Memo12334: if not private
 MSmits: highest level in high school, 16-18 year olds
 MSmits: both for physics and CS
 Memo12334: ah u rlly big brain
 MSmits: many here have big brains
 MSmits: CG is a brain attractor
 Astrobytes: Strange attractor :P
 MSmits: they go together
 Astrobytes: :D
 LIONSxLEADER: the games are entertaining thusfar, and i like the 15 minute coding challenges i've failed to finish like 5 of
 MSmits: oh clashes
 LIONSxLEADER: yet to complete one
 MSmits: I did my first clashes last week
 Astrobytes: There's something for everyone here, hopefully
 MSmits: been here for over 2 years
 Memo12334: are u guys legend
 MSmits: never clashed before, but they did the quest map
 Hjax: legend in what? 
 Washier: they are
 MSmits: we have legend leagues in bot arena's Memo12334
 Memo12334: rank
 LIONSxLEADER: i think they are the best feature for what i need, the ability to code faster
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: Guru you mean
 LIONSxLEADER: i can make just about anything by now
 MSmits: rank 1 to 100 are guru
 Hjax: im not a guru, im a grandmaster 
 Hjax: some day guru
 MSmits: just a matter of time
 Hjax: matter of motivation to play multis 
 Memo12334: nvm I understood something wrong
 MSmits: this rank is partially a matter of time invested
 Memo12334: It's only about the neural network challenge or something
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: whats that? A puzzle?
 MSmits: i seem to remember that
 Hjax: the individual games have ranks that go up to legend, for instance i am legend in Crystal Rush 
 Memo12334: yes about AI , it goes from bronz to silver etc
 MSmits: ohh
 LIONSxLEADER: can you submit multiple times?
 Memo12334: dont rlly know tbh , just took a look at
 Astrobytes: All the multiplayer bot programming games have leagues like that
 MSmits: that was your first contest right Hjax?
 Hjax: first one i took seriously 
 MSmits: was it also your first bot experience here?
 MSmits: oh ok
 Hjax: i had messed around with PR and LC&amp;M 
 Hjax: but only for a few hours each 
 MSmits: Locam is cool
 Astrobytes: Ah Pull Request, some game that was :P
 Hjax: and then i skipped OOC and gave up on pacman halfway through 
 Hjax: hoping the next contest will be better
 MSmits: contests are hit and miss mostly. With multi's you know what you're getting into
 Astrobytes: Yeah, can't please all the people all of the time
 MSmits: Boardgames ruined me a bit. It's everything I like about contest games without the unnecessary bits 
 MSmits: pun unintended :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Memo12334: oh now I know why it didnt' work, ty Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: np Memo12334
 Memo12334: also what's that thing next to ur name, does it mean ur a mod 
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 dep: wow im rank 2 in wood 1 league
 MSmits: rank 2 below boss you mean?
 dep: yeah
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: is there much rating difference?
 dep: but im having problems with boosting
 dep: idk
 MSmits: why a problem?
 dep: my problem is idk how to find my own orientation
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: CSB is a bit weird with the input changing each league
 MSmits: dont remember what you get
 dep: i wanna do boosts when im doing long straights
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: generally I just boost at start
 MSmits: it's almost always best
 dep: hmmm
 dep: i wanna make it smarter u know
 MSmits: sometimes you overshoot the first turn
 dep: ikr
 MSmits: I know
 MSmits: but you're in wood1, it's not the most important thing 
 MSmits: try avoiding overshooting checkpoints in general
 MSmits: reduce your speed at the right time and such
 dep: hmmmmmm ok
 MSmits: maybe turn off power if you are not facing in the direction you want to accelerate
 MSmits: some angle margin or something
 Washier: i also always boost at the start. and try to aim taking your velocity in account
 dep: i try boosting at start
 LIONSxLEADER: Hey MSmits How hard am i going to have to try to beat your zombie score
 Hjax: my csb is like, the bare minimum to get the rating points lol  
 MSmits: if you get around rank 300 or so, you have beaten me LIONSxLEADER
 LIONSxLEADER: ur #14
 MSmits: yeah but the validators are publicly available
 MSmits: so i calculated offline
 MSmits: it's only like this for a few puzzles btw, 
 LIONSxLEADER: interesting
 MSmits: if i turn off my hardcoded solutions i am rank 200-300 or so, not sure
 MSmits: been a while
 MSmits: I'm not really into optimization arenas
 MSmits: usually do botting
 Hjax: yeah multis are more fun 
 LIONSxLEADER: interesting
 Washier: i got 700th with some pretty simple c# heuristics.
 MSmits: mine is simple too
 LIONSxLEADER: i can submit more than once then nice
 MSmits: I think it's just MC
 MSmits: yeah, you could get lucky&#160;:)
 MSmits: getting 100% is not always easy
 MSmits: i had some fails 
 dep: oh yeah why dont i ignore my orientations and just boost when the distance is kinda far
 dep: instead of boosting at the start
 Washier: concentrate on your cornering first
 dep: is my cornering bad?
 dep: i win most battles though
 dep: hmmm
 dep: idk about my cornering
 Hjax: nothing seems to be loading but the chat 
 dep: ok got better than the boss lol
 dep: just pure luck gg
 oneCOOKIE: Standard Error Stream:error: class entity is public, should be declared in a file named entity.java
 oneCOOKIE: I am getting this eroor
 oneCOOKIE: Any idea how to fix this one?
 dep: no idea on js , sorry
 oneCOOKIE: Oh okay, thanks anyway
 Hjax: dont use a public class?
 Astrobytes: drop the public
 Hjax: just class entity 
 Astrobytes: Or put it inside your Player class
 derjack: drop the bass
 Astrobytes: DJ derjack in da house
 Astrobytes: pony riddims
 derjack: i lik playing pony music to pony haters. especially when they say its good
 Astrobytes: Derjack ft. MC TS
 Hjax: lol MC TS
 Hjax: took me a second 
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 derjack: hm?
 Washier: please link pony music
 derjack: i.e. orchestral <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NbyUtARW6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NbyUtARW6I</a>

 derjack: now find pony haters and link those
 dep: how u find ur own position and orientation in CSB?
 dep: ok time to get some sleep anyways bai
 Hjax: cya

 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: *Inserts brain*
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wow, it's looking smarter already
 Astrobytes: I'm only half joking, write a sim &amp; search for it
 SPDene: * is worried who MaliciouslyCrypticUsername got that brain from *
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I got that brain from myself, don't worry
 Astrobytes:  SPDene you can do /me

 Kacper_D: I get bad_alloc thrown when running test online, but when I run same code locally everything's ok. Anyone had similar problems? Because I'm kinda lost now
 eulerscheZahl: using C++?
 Kacper_D: yup
 eulerscheZahl: try using the same environment as CodinGame
 eulerscheZahl: that is Linux and g++
 eulerscheZahl: then you should see the same error i suppose
 Kacper_D: Sounds like good idea

 MSmits: anyone know the builtin function to reverse the bits in a uint64_t, if it exists?
 eulerscheZahl: :noodles:
 MSmits: reverse the order i mean
 MSmits: 1st becomes 64th
 eulerscheZahl: i had a full lecture about bit rotation
 eulerscheZahl: most efficient ways for different lengths using bitmasks
 eulerscheZahl: you won't be able to do this in a single operation I think
 MSmits: that's ok, i just want the fastest way
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jjj.de/bitwizardry/bitwizardrypage.html">https://jjj.de/bitwizardry/bitwizardrypage.html</a>somewhere here
 eulerscheZahl: bitrotate.h i guess
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: mmh rotating words is different
 AntiSquid: how do you find sites with those kind of names?
 AntiSquid: jj.de lol
 eulerscheZahl: just checked, rotate isn't it
 eulerscheZahl: jjj.de
 Astrobytes: revbin?
 tomatoes: that bit twiding page also mention some reversing
 eulerscheZahl: you missed a j
 tomatoes: from uttt forum topic
 eulerscheZahl: and that prof was the 2nd corrector of my bachelor thesis

 MSmits: still a little surprised there isn't a builtin for it
 Astrobytes: told you it was revbin
 Astrobytes: And yeah
 MSmits: ah yeah you said
 MSmits: mmh this one is table based
 MSmits: is that better?
 eulerscheZahl: there was a version without table
 MSmits: yeah probably
 Astrobytes: in the same file

 AggYzz: what is the codingame discord
 Astrobytes: A Discord server for codingame
 AggYzz: what is the link idot
 Astrobytes: Excuse me?
 AggYzz: please may I have the link to the discord server, good sir
 Astrobytes: Look up top
 AggYzz: i am a blind man
 Astrobytes: A blind man couldn't miss that "JOIN US ON DISCORD" button

 Astrobytes: He's not blind
 AggYzz: are you questioning my disabilities
 Astrobytes: Please
 AggYzz: what
 Hjax: i feel like antagonizing a mod isnt in your best interest 
 Hjax: but hey, you do you 
 Astrobytes: Just go join a clash and carry on AggYzz
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm not sure if i shall believe the story of being blind or not
 kiana_j: hi guys!:)
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen another user compaining about the IDE on the forum, struggling with the screenreader
 eulerscheZahl: and some games are a pain for colorblind people of course.red and orange are way too similar even for me (I can see colors)
 AggYzz: this game is unfair for blidnd people
 AggYzz: they cant see the code
 Astrobytes: He's not blind, he's regular. Clashes a lot, swears a lot
 AggYzz: whos not blind
 Astrobytes: Annoying but not terrible.
 AggYzz: me
 eulerscheZahl: the nick looked familiar, wasn't sure
 eulerscheZahl: but even regular users can be blind
 AggYzz: my great grandpa reads the text
 Astrobytes: And yeah, there's been one or two blind users made posts re. that in the forum I believe
 tomatoes: ocean of code colors was a bit hard 👀
 Astrobytes: AggYzz, seriously, go back to clashing
 AggYzz: but i am bad at clashing
 AggYzz: so I rather chat here
 eulerscheZahl: you win, then i'll go
 eulerscheZahl: good night
 Astrobytes: lol, night eulerscheZahl
 AggYzz: bye bye
 Astrobytes: tomatoes, you colourblind?
 AggYzz: yyayayya i won
 tomatoes: nope
 Astrobytes: But you found OOC colours hard?
 AggYzz:  like beans more than tomatoes
 Astrobytes: AggYzz please do something a little more productive with your time, it will benefit us all
 tomatoes: sometimes. red + orange + mixed + 2 small mines
 Astrobytes: Interesting, I don't get any issue with that and I *am* colourblind :D
 tomatoes: rarely, but got some "wtf?? ah, thats opponent mine"
 tomatoes: even they're in the different corners
 Astrobytes: Actually, now I come to think about it yes, it was a little tricky sometimes
 Memo12334: Astrobytes
 Memo12334: u there
 Astrobytes: Partially yes, what's up?
 Memo12334: procastinated a lot so don't mock me for still not solving it but I need a deceasar function too right?
 Memo12334: for decoding
 Memo12334: should have dmed
 Astrobytes: Not in the habit of mocking unless justified. Yes you do
 AntiSquid: you talk as if you invented procrastination Memo12334, why do you think we are in chat?
 jacek: Caturday soon
 Uljahn: almost there
 AntiSquid: celebrating caturdays eve?
 Astrobytes: miaowwwwlmost there
 Uljahn: synchronous celebration for different time zones is hard
 MSmits: it is a conundrum
 <b>**Astrobytes puts on Mad Knight hat: we can celebrate my birthday instead</b>
 MSmits: Uljahm can't join then&#160;:(
 MSmits: Uljahn that is
 Astrobytes: why?
 MSmits: cuz it's not your birthday for him
 Astrobytes: Donno his location, it's 2357 some places in RU
 jacek: different calendar, like octover revolution in september
 jacek: or november*
 MSmits: ohh i forgot that we're basically on Poland time
 Astrobytes: (2357 as in clock time not year btw)
 MSmits: timezones are really werd for my country
 MSmits: weird
 Astrobytes: ah timezones in general
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: It's always 1700 somewhere
 MSmits: how is that?
 MSmits: isn't 1/60th of the time 1700 somewhere?
 Astrobytes: 'IT's Five O' Clock Somewhere' - it's a song
 Astrobytes: and a saying
 MSmits: o
 Astrobytes: Why bars have happy hour starting at 5pm usually too
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I never really went to bars
 MSmits: yay my sim works 
 Astrobytes: I've frequented a few pubs in my time, mostly for the food and after drinks
 MSmits: 23 moves for 1st turn on breakthrough, seems right
 Astrobytes: Breakthrough right?
 jacek: 23?
 MSmits: 22
 MSmits: sry, i counted the root node
 Astrobytes: More like it
 MSmits: I went with the reversed boardstate
 MSmits: so i reverse the opponent board when generating moves
 MSmits: otherwise both players start with their 20 lowest bits set
 jacek: not16?
 MSmits: 16 again
 MSmits: i think i need to sleep
 MSmits: 10x10 breakthrough is a thing though :P
 MSmits: it's nice to do the board this way in case i need to do lookups with pdep and such
 MSmits: pext actually
 MSmits: it's only one reverse per move generation, so it's probably negligible
 MSmits: time to try and get a random move bot going
 MSmits: when i got that, I'll sleep
 jacek: can people live thay long without sleep?
 MSmits: hopefully
 jacek: why pext/pdep for breakthrough o.O
 Astrobytes: his board works in mysterious ways
 MSmits: racing lookups
 MSmits: you can check if a move sends you to a racing condition when it enters the opponent side
 MSmits: meaning you solved the game 6 plies sooner
 MSmits: or 7
 MSmits: not usre
 MSmits: sure
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: you lookup a triangular field of opponent pawns to see if you can race through them 
 MSmits: without being stopped
 FLQ4: waot
 FLQ4: wait
 FLQ4: astrobytes pfp is a cat 
 FLQ4: i thought it was an alien 
 Astrobytes: I thought you meant a different sort of race condition MSmits lol
 Astrobytes: Well it acts like one sometimes FLQ4
 MSmits: nah thats how it's called in literature i think
 MSmits: because your pawn is unstoppable, you know you win in 3 plays
 jacek: multithreading literature?
 MSmits: lemme find something
 jacek: you mean the job schedule solving thing?
 Astrobytes: I meant race condition in the traditional sense, not in the Breakthrough sense

 MSmits: it's in the title
 Astrobytes: MSmits:It's five o'clock somewhere
 jacek: race patterns
 Astrobytes: wtf
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition</a>
 MSmits: allright race patterns
 MSmits: but it;s still a condition 
 MSmits: in which you can race
 MSmits: so :P
 jacek: racecar reversed is racecar
 MSmits: and what if you reverse it again?
 Astrobytes: thank you for your palindromic interlude jacek
 Astrobytes: or even interjection
 Astrobytes: meh, beer taking effect
 MSmits: beer
 MSmits: :bear:
 MSmits: in Dutch
 Astrobytes: Fine, "bier"
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: :beer:
 MSmits: this coordinate system is annoying
 MSmits: I need to do string stuff to tell the game where to move :rage:
 Astrobytes: Oh come on it's trivial to convert
 jacek: itsnt the same with othello?
 MSmits: oh, good point
 MSmits: no wait
 MSmits: its not
 MSmits: othello has no from -&gt; to
 Astrobytes: Still trivial though
 MSmits: lazy
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: it's actually quite a few steps
 MSmits: i don't store the moves
 MSmits: so i need to figure out the difference between the child node and the root node to know what the move was
 MSmits: then reverse it if it is the 2nd player
 MSmits: do a builtin_ctzl to get the index
 MSmits: and then the string stuff
 MSmits: all of this for both from and to coord
 Astrobytes: Maybe just store the move
 Astrobytes: Not exactly big
 MSmits: why store it on so many nodes when you only need it at the top
 MSmits: it's an extra instruction or two times 100k+
 Astrobytes: Stop moaning and do it then :P
 MSmits: i am just lazy, i always do it this way, but I want to still complain :P
 JBM: yay, beer
 Astrobytes: hell yes, it's the least I deserve
 JBM: me too
 JBM: i needed that
 JBM: ok, back to stream
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/480830977">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/480830977</a>  it works!!!!
 MSmits: random moves ofc
 Astrobytes: oh you're streaming JBM, totally forgot&#160;:/
 JBM: still up for a little time
 JBM: but the puzzle's solved now, it's just cleanup and improve time
 Astrobytes: going off soon but I'll pop in
 Astrobytes: gg MSmits
 Astrobytes: *gj
 MSmits: yeah... happy... I know it'll crash and burn when I switch players probably :P
 MSmits: it never works for p2 the first time it works for p1
 DomiKo: gj MSmits :wink:
 MSmits: thanks DomiKo
 MSmits: yep bugged as p2 :P
 jacek: enough to release at friday night
 MSmits: I'll fix it&#160;:)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/480831221">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/480831221</a>
 MSmits: humiliating :P
 MSmits: but it works at least
 MSmits: submitted, see if i get crashes
 MSmits: nope, it's working. Beating some bots with random moves lol
 MSmits: I think this is the first time I made a bot for a boardgame with no draws
 MSmits: that's different
 MSmits: 125/163, so that's 38 players equal or worse than random
 Astrobytes: It works. Now sleep :P
 MSmits: yea yeah
 MSmits: going.. Gn all!
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits
 Astrobytes: I'm out too, gn all
 coderinblack: clash of code anyone?
 andreza.bona: oui
 coderinblack: alright
 coderinblack: im going to start then
 Laminator: did you not test your code lol
 andreza.bona: who?
 Laminator: coderinblack had something closee to working. but submited with like 6 minutes left to go for 0%
 RJMontalvo: I'll admit, these puzzles make me feel dumb half the time. 
 Gorbit99: but then you can feel so much better when you do them finally
 RJMontalvo: it doesn't make sense until it does. 
 Gorbit99: which puzzle?
 RJMontalvo: hehehe one of the "easy" ones. I'm only a week into lessons in c# 
 RJMontalvo: I'll get it eventually&#160;:)
 itay121: how do I get off the auto correct in clash of code?
 Denshire: I think it might be in the settings in the editor
 Gorbit99: best you can do is turn off "accept suggestions on Enter key" afaik
 Denshire: Yeah, that's what I was talking about
 Denshire: I don't think there's a way to make it go away completely
 Gorbit99: also, there's a sort of CSS trick I heard
 Denshire: I'm honestly not that experienced so I wouldn't know that much
 Gorbit99: it's annoying as hell in CoC
 Denshire: yeah especially in fastest
 Putnam3145: what... suggestions are there
 Putnam3145: i haven't noticed any?
 Denshire: the box that pops up that gives you options on how to finish a word
 Gorbit99: well, intellisense basically
 Denshire: yeah
 Putnam3145: oh
 Gorbit99: if you spend enough time to get language support activated that is
 Putnam3145: somehow i completely tuned that out
 Gorbit99: it's hard to tune it out, when it takes control of your arrow keys 😂
 Denshire: me trying to go to the next line for hours before realizing i've just been scrolling through the suggestions: "oh"
 Gorbit99: that's why vim would be a great thing to have, but doesn't work for me
 Denshire: it would be more comfortable for those who know vim, for sure
 Denshire: as someone who doesn't, i don't think i would care
 Gorbit99: well, I know vim, I'm just facing bugs with it

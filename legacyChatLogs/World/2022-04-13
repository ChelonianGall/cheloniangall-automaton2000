 Darleanow: oh and btw, i was wondering how i could shorten this&#160;:
 Mortis_666: Darleanow use a//b instead of floor
 Mortis_666: *p
 Darleanow: oh , does it round it to the min number&#160;?
 Darleanow: like floor does&#160;?
 Mortis_666: yes
 Darleanow: that's nice, any other ideas&#160;?
 Darleanow: ty&#160;:)
 Darleanow: someone did a shorter one: i,I,c=int,input,0for j in range(i(I())):c+=i(I())I(c//(j+1))
 Darleanow: RsCrazy is a genius :oo
 Mortis_666: Darleanow u can read this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=chuck-norris-golf">https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=chuck-norris-golf</a>
 Darleanow: thanks&#160;!!:)
 Darleanow: is there any way to do only coc length of code&#160;?
 Darleanow: because the fastest one is a bit annoying lul
 Mortis_666: no&#160;:(
 Darleanow: okay i've got an idea, why it is like this
 Darleanow: everyone who're creating coc ggames are making them on fastest
 Darleanow: but not on shortest or reverse
 Mortis_666: its random
 Mortis_666: but u can choose in private clash
 Darleanow: oh thats nice&#160;!
 Darleanow: but i want the contest lol
 Uljahn: just skip all except shortest [solved]

 jacek: you can do for i in number:
 Darleanow: yeah but why am i unable to do a len(number)&#160;?

 Darleanow: its now working with this
 Uljahn: you mean a += i&#160;?
 Uljahn: what are you trying to achieve?
 Darleanow: No worries Uljahn its fixed, i was trying to convert an int to a str
 Darleanow: using the method number=str(number)
 Uljahn: nice
 Darleanow: but it didn't worked at first, so i had to use a="".join(i) in a for loop

 Passifi: kk any mods here&#160;? please make coding game use faster servers
 Passifi: nvm I am stupid I don't have my code jump over piece sizes I have calculated before so that causes the problem
 Passifi: this chat truly is a great rubber duck&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: You don't need maps/queues/...  Simple arrays do the job
 Passifi: but I have to check what combos I already went through, right&#160;? and without the map the look up time would be so much bigger wouldn't it&#160;?
 Passifi: Well, regardless maybe if I think about how to implement the thing with just arrays I get to the bottom of this, thx for the input&#160;:)
 Uljahn: for your information mods are not admins but regular users, they can't develop CG platform

 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: how can i do not got daily taco
 Wontonimo: it's not a daily taco.  it's for saying something on the channel after it has been quiet for an hour
 Thorcode: ah 
 Thorcode: wonton pls take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 Thorcode: can i still have  CG point in time travelers?
 Thorcode: yep still have in an easier way 
 Darleanow: Hello Thorcode and Wontonimo&#160;:)
 Thorcode: hi Darleanow
 Darleanow: wazzup&#160;?:)
 DefNotColin: is there a good place to wirte my java script code so i can upload it to my game
 Darleanow:&#160;??
 Darleanow: you have an ide there already
 DefNotColin: where?
 Darleanow: i mean if you're solving a challenge
 DefNotColin: no im makignmy own game
 Darleanow: otherwise use VSC or Atom
 DefNotColin: ok ty
 Darleanow: if youre comfortable with command line etc, go Atom, otherwise VSC is more user friendly
 Darleanow: Atom has the best interface for me, depends on you tho
 DefNotColin: im decent with javascript i just need a place to imput code
 Darleanow: Not talking about jsc, you should use VSC then
 DefNotColin: ok

 Thorcode: oh nevermind
 Thorcode: i found him
 vinnie_rinella: how do i make the guy move in code v zombies
 vinnie_rinella: nvm
 vinnie_rinella: how do i find coordinates in it tho
 5DN1L: what coordinates?
 vinnie_rinella: hhold on i think i  under stand it
 5DN1L: ok, good
 vinnie_rinella: how do i tell the program where the humans are 
 Darleanow: hello 5DN1L&#160;:)
 Darleanow: vinnie, if i remember correctly theres a loop giving you pos of them
 5DN1L: hello Darleanow
 Darleanow: you can also opt for a strategy where you go for zombies instead of humans
 Darleanow: it works great too&#160;!
 Darleanow: how are you man&#160;?&#160;:)
 5DN1L: good, thanks
 5DN1L: how are you?
 Darleanow: i made some progress since the last time we've talked
 Darleanow: i'm great too&#160;!
 5DN1L: nice
 Darleanow: it's been a while i haven't see u there
 vinnie_rinella: i know that there is a loop giving me positions but the console.log statment wont accept it
 5DN1L: Yeah, I had limited internet access for some time
 Darleanow: i'm not familiar with js, so i can't help you about the syntax
 Darleanow: and as it's a loop, the values changes everytime, try to put your console.log in the loop
 5DN1L: what console.log code do you have vinnie_rinella&#160;?
 Darleanow: or store the values into a list where you can evaluate distances from you
 Darleanow: oh that sucks, but glad you're back again&#160;!&#160;:)
 5DN1L: yeah, slowly getting back to full speed...
 vinnie_rinella: console.log(inputs[1] inputs[2]);
 Darleanow: interne providers are rat anyways
 5DN1L: vinnie_rinella i think the syntax is wrong?
 Darleanow: vinnie, is it in the loop where human locations are given&#160;?
 vinnie_rinella: no
 vinnie_rinella: does it need to be
 5DN1L: you can't just put a space in between like that
 vinnie_rinella: what is the syntax that would fix it then 
 Darleanow: indeed, because if you do after the loop you gon have only the last value
 Darleanow: a,d 5DN1L is right too
 Darleanow: maybe a  ,&#160;??
 BJD: console.log(inputs[1]+' '+inputs[2]);
 5DN1L: ^ that
 vinnie_rinella: thanks!
 Darleanow: he reminds of me lol
 vinnie_rinella: haha
 Darleanow: i'll be happy to help whenever you need&#160;!
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 vinnie_rinella: if i can i will also help you&#160;!
 Darleanow: appreciate, but i do think i know a little bit more atm&#160;:)
 Darleanow: thanks to everyone there
 vinnie_rinella: yea 
 vinnie_rinella: haha
 Darleanow: and i'm using python tho
 vinnie_rinella: i know a little about it i used to code it but i thought i liked javascript more
 Darleanow: 5DN1L , when u want to pop an item from a list i should use lst.pop(indexpos) right&#160;?
 Darleanow: because it's not removing it from the list, which i don't know why
 5DN1L: what's the code
 Darleanow: the statement is in the else: 
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5c7f20b-78de-41ea-a096-8cadf43e2ecb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b5c7f20b-78de-41ea-a096-8cadf43e2ecb</a>
 5DN1L: lst=lst.pop(1) &lt;- nope
 vinnie_rinella: how would i go about makeing it pick one human to go to
 5DN1L: pop changes the list and returns what has been popped
 vinnie_rinella: because on the second test case it just goes back and forth and both humans end up dead
 5DN1L: so if you do: p = lst.pop(1), then lst will lose lst[1], and p will contain the value of lst[1]
 Thorcode: to be easy just try to save one human first
 Thorcode: the closet to you
 Darleanow: oh okay, is there a built in func to remove an item from the lst&#160;?
 vinnie_rinella: i know but it switches back and forth 
 Thorcode: just go around that human to get 100&#160;%
 vinnie_rinella: how do i tell it which human to pic
 vinnie_rinella: pick*
 5DN1L: Darleanow, I mean it is removed that way. but if you just want to throw away the result, then you can also use del or remove
 Darleanow: vinnie, you can also try to eval distance between you and zombies, and focus the closest one then go to the closest one etc
 Darleanow: okay thanks&#160;!
 vinnie_rinella: Darleanow im not sure i under stand what your sayign
 vinnie_rinella: saying*
 Darleanow: basically, i'm trying to check if i can divide by d if if i poop a number
 5DN1L: pop it don't poop it :joy:
 vinnie_rinella: not that
 Darleanow: ahahhaha xd
 Darleanow: oops
 Darleanow: typing too fast
 vinnie_rinella: yea haha
 Darleanow: vinnie_rinella basically, instead of trying to protect humans, you can act like you rush zombies; eval distances and focus the closest to you, the do so for the next one etc until they're all dead
 Darleanow: but you can also go and protect one human
 5DN1L: meaning you need maths and calculation and then comparison, vinnie_rinella
 vinnie_rinella: i kind of jurry rigged it and it worked so i guess i did it
 5DN1L: not difficult to get 100%
 5DN1L: but a bit more difficult to get higher marks
 Darleanow: indeed, there's a lot of manners to do it&#160;!
 vinnie_rinella: yea
 Darleanow: i should go and optimize it too tho xD
 vinnie_rinella: it trys to go to where the other zombie died how do i fix that
 5DN1L: your code tells it to
 5DN1L: so fix your code :shrug:
 vinnie_rinella: what is the syntax for checking if a constant variable is 0
 Darleanow: if var ==0
 Darleanow: smth like this
 vinnie_rinella: ok thanks
 Darleanow: google is ur friend tho&#160;!
 vinnie_rinella: yea thats what it is i remember now
 vinnie_rinella: i just made it camp the human with the id of zero
 Darleanow: gjob&#160;!
 Husoski: "Constant variable" sounds a bit like "jumbo shrimp" or "military intelligence".
 Darleanow: the second one was savage lmfao
 Husoski: I almost forgot..."postal service".
 Darleanow: XDDDDDDD
 Darleanow: or either fraternity police
 vinnie_rinella: how do i tell the code to go to the farther human
 Darleanow: check distances
 Darleanow: and compare them
 vinnie_rinella: how?
 Darleanow: you're given x;y
 Darleanow: of each human
 Darleanow: simply substract them to yours
 vinnie_rinella: how do i get it for 2
 Darleanow: put them in a list
 vinnie_rinella: how
 Darleanow: and print the index value which is the farther
 Darleanow: with the function max
 Darleanow: google is ur friend&#160;:)
 Darleanow: in python, the print statement would be&#160;:
 Darleanow: lst.sort()
 Darleanow: print(list[-1])
 Darleanow: or smth like that
 Darleanow: the only way to learn is the boring way
 Darleanow: google google and goole
 Nik05: Beginning of programming can be really confusing :P
 Nik05: Well later on, it can still be
 5DN1L: Confusing in different aspects
 Nik05: yeah&#160;:)
 Darleanow: hey nik, i had a question
 Darleanow: whats the difference between cpp and c#
 Nik05: Uh why are you asking me?
 Darleanow: bc i saw you code in both&#160;:)
 Nik05: Lots of similarities and differences :P
 Darleanow: CLEAR 
 Nik05: Haven't used C++ in a long time though
 Darleanow: oh :0
 Husoski: C# started out as a clone of Java, but with .NET instead of the Java SE platform.
 Darleanow: need help&#160;:

 5DN1L: no spam please
 5DN1L: why waste the time, really
 Nik05: Hm I wanted to say the biggest difference is having a runtime for C#/Java, which include a garbage collector
 Nik05: While C++ uses RAII(or something) for cleaning up resources
 Husoski: I'd guess it's the "lstb = lst;" statement. 
 Husoski: That does NOT make a copy of lst.  Both lst and lstb will refer to the *same* array object after than statement.
 Darleanow: Thanks Nik05&#160;:))
 Darleanow: and how could i copy lst to lstb
 Darleanow: using  a loop&#160;?
 Darleanow: ty&#160;:)
 Darleanow: its working&#160;!
 Nik05: lst[:] makes a copy? Not a slice/reference into the lsit?
 Darleanow: i used lstb = list(lst)
 Darleanow: looked mor familiar&#160;:)
 Husoski: Python lists don't make proxy objects for slices.  
 Darleanow: wdtm&#160;?
 Nik05: I guess it makes a copy of the slice instead of a fatpointer
 Husoski: a[b:c] extracts the elements into a new list.  Some other collection methods do make an object that give you a view of the original object that changes when the original does.  dict.values() for example, doesn't return a list or tuple.  It returns an object that indexes into the original dictionary.

 Wizard-Dude: quick question, how do you find your position in Mean Max?
 5DN1L: Mortis_666 intersection of the line and the circle
 5DN1L: you get both equations
 Darleanow: theres probably an indication
 Darleanow: at the start
 Darleanow: giving pos of everyone
 Darleanow: with a following id
 Mortis_666: 🤔
 Darleanow: idk tbh Wizard-Dude
 Husoski: ttfn ... breakfast time on the us west coast
 Wizard-Dude: they do have a unit id, but I don't know what my id is?  
 5DN1L: statement says: (you are player 0)
 Mortis_666: 5DN1L can you give further explanation?
 Wizard-Dude: oh whoops
 MrMaster500: Hello
 nathan-415: Hi, I just started doing Code Royal, and I want to train multiple Barracks in Golang. I have tried using an array, but that doesn’t work. Could you tell me how I would train multiple barracks?
 5DN1L: MrMaster500 hello and don't spam again, otherwise you'll be banned
 Mortis_666: or u can draw it so i can understand it better
 MrMaster500: ok
 MrMaster500: 5DN1L
 Wizard-Dude: thanks for that, didn't see that at the top 
 5DN1L: Mortis_666 oh I thought you had the equation of the circle
 5DN1L: I think you might have to have that info in order to calculate :thinking:
 Mortis_666: i only have the coordinates of a and b and need to find the coordinate of c
 5DN1L: because the circle can be bigger or smaller depending on where C is
 Mortis_666: ah I have the radius of the circle too
 5DN1L: and the centre coordinates too?
 Mortis_666: yes, its (0, 0)
 5DN1L: then you can find the equation of the circle
 5DN1L: with radius and centre coordinates
 5DN1L: as for the line, you have point A and B, so you can find equation of the line
 5DN1L: express y in terms of x or x in terms of y, then substitute it in the equation of the circle
 nathan-415: Hi, I just started doing Code Royal, and I want to train multiple Barracks in Golang. I have tried using an array, but that doesn’t work. Could you tell me how I would train multiple barracks?
 5DN1L: array isn't the issue i guess
 5DN1L: it's more what you do with it
 5DN1L: I think you should explain your strategy/code in more details in the forum post
 5DN1L: then wait for somebody to reply you there
 5DN1L: or here
 5DN1L: with luck
 5DN1L: or you can also read the thread
 5DN1L: or the resources on the front page of the puzzle
 5DN1L: there are some hints and tips
 nathan-415: I have done all the other stuff so, I am going to post my problem in the discussion
 nathan-415: Thanks!
 5DN1L: ok, more specifics will help
 5DN1L: no problem&#160;:)

 5DN1L: vinnie_rinella you read the coordinates of each human
 Wontonimo: sorry everyone for the double spam from antiwonto&#160;;(
 5DN1L: then store them in an array
 vinnie_rinella: yea when that happens i think you guys should but him to sleep for a while 
 Darleanow: okay it's not workign TOT
 vinnie_rinella: 5DN1L do you have an example?
 5DN1L: no, you can google
 vinnie_rinella: ok
 Darleanow: while zoom==1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc9962bc-29ef-4301-96c2-a8aa3739975a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc9962bc-29ef-4301-96c2-a8aa3739975a</a>
 Darleanow: does someone finds any error&#160;?
 vinnie_rinella: what language is that Darleanow
 Darleanow: py
 vinnie_rinella: k
 5DN1L: Darleanow do you intend to learn debugging? :thinking:
 Darleanow: xDD
 vinnie_rinella: what is the problem with the code
 5DN1L: we can't debug for you all the time, Darleanow
 Darleanow: my brain is out of range atm
 vinnie_rinella: which puzzle are you doing
 Darleanow: okay sir, not disturbing you again :p
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/largest-number">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/largest-number</a>
 Darleanow: this one
 vinnie_rinella: ok
 5DN1L: it's not disturbing
 Wontonimo: nope.  sorry Darleanow, looking at that code doesn't make me want to debug it.  It isn't clearr what the problem is or what you are doing.  If you clean it up it may even make it easier for you to debug
 Darleanow: ill clean it up
 5DN1L: but it'll really help you in the long run to learn debugging skills
 vinnie_rinella: what is it outputting
 Wontonimo: what 5DN1L said, add debug lines and look at the debug output to see what's happening
 Wontonimo: also, move some logic into a function and write a micro test for it
 zakacat: take taco
 Wontonimo: here is an example of writing micro tests in code to solve a problem Darleanow <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148</a>
 zakacat: :taco: Wontonimo
 zakacat: is tacobot dead?
 zakacat: Rest in Tacos
 Wontonimo: hint&#160;: don't try to solve the whole problem and instead think of some small function that will help you get you end result and write a test to prove that it works... then move on
 Darleanow: this is what i'm doing
 Wontonimo: taco bot is ded zakacat
 Darleanow: first i did for 0 numbers to remove
 zakacat: shame
 Darleanow: then for one, then added a loop stop if i check the whole number
 Uljahn: what? aren't you iterating through a string?
 Uljahn: btw how many beginner tutorials have you done?
 Darleanow: 6&#160;!
 jacek: oh my
 Darleanow: this is why i'm trying to do them 
 Nik05: "hint: [...] and write a test to prove that it works... [...]" This!
 Darleanow: my brain going out of range too
 Darleanow: won't understand this ahah
 Darleanow: i'll figure out by myself  !!!
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1fbdef04-b393-48e6-b7fd-c115653ac6cf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1fbdef04-b393-48e6-b7fd-c115653ac6cf</a>
 Wontonimo: have you ever tried following your code with pencil and paper Darleanow&#160;?  Pretend you are the computer and follow the code exactly as it is written, using your pencil and paper to track values of variables.  It is a super useful skill to have and will give you needed insight into what the computer does
 Darleanow: ok i will try this
 Wontonimo: it really should be the first thing that programmers are shown to do.  It's a critical skill to master
 jacek: :upside_down: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i1.kwejk.pl/k/obrazki/2022/04/0wamNXO3FSYzxjTm.jpg">https://i1.kwejk.pl/k/obrazki/2022/04/0wamNXO3FSYzxjTm.jpg</a>
 Wontonimo: random, but funny
 Darleanow: i'm doing it now&#160;!
 Darleanow: xd
 Wontonimo: actually, jacek, I love that pic!  What a great demonstration of the power of the right (or wrong) mental model for solving a problem
 jacek: :o
 jacek: so, muzero?
 Wontonimo: a good mental model for chess is lines of force, areas of control.  They really help.  Thinking of throwing horses doesn't help, it isn't a useful mental model.  Funny, but unhelpful.  Ima gonna keep this :grin:
 Wontonimo: what about mu zero&#160;?
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f0415950-2bf8-46dd-b9cf-46d41519d375">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f0415950-2bf8-46dd-b9cf-46d41519d375</a>
 Darleanow: here you go wonto
 jacek: it may have right or wrong model of chess rules
 Darleanow: its the explanation of this&#160;: 
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ae774e8-c663-4a77-ba9e-2fbec0835699">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ae774e8-c663-4a77-ba9e-2fbec0835699</a>
 Darleanow: OK I FINALLY HAVE AN IDEA
 Wontonimo: combine the two Darleanow, where the explanation becomes comments in the code
 Darleanow: nvm...
 Wontonimo: and make it into a function ...
 Wontonimo: and then write some microtests for that function&#160;;)
 Nik05: Anyone here that knows something about rust?
 Wontonimo: not me
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b109b2a7-611a-4530-9808-76896d4318bd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b109b2a7-611a-4530-9808-76896d4318bd</a>
 Darleanow: here you go&#160;!
 Wontonimo: hmm, i meant more for your own sake.  No need to keep posting here.  Work on it on your own for a while
 Nik05: languageusespacestomakethingseasiertoread
 Darleanow: okay sir&#160;!:)
 Darleanow: ahahhaha nik
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d59120b-02f3-4542-a174-5e81a0e6d596">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d59120b-02f3-4542-a174-5e81a0e6d596</a>
 Darleanow: better now&#160;?:)
 Wontonimo: when i said a while, what i meant is at least an hour or two, not 30 seconds.
 Nik05: I would also use spaces between operators
 Nik05: :P
 Darleanow: yeah Wonto, i'm no asking for debugs dw wanted to make sure its easily readable, anyways
 Darleanow: brb in a few hours every1
 jacek: if you cant read it, then its not
 vinnie_rinella:  if (humanId == 0,humanId == 1) {
 Ajaiy: Which puzzle?
 Uljahn: you have to use logical conjunction or disjunction between two logical statements to combine them
 Wontonimo: what are you trying to accomplish with&#160;:if (humanId == 0,humanId == 1)
 Wontonimo: do you mean &amp;&amp; (and) or do you mean || (or)
 Wontonimo: it doesn't make sense to be &amp;&amp; because it will always be false
 Wontonimo: so rewrite it like thisif (humanId == 0 || humanId == 1) {
 jacek: he didnt specify the language. the , could be ||
 FrancoRoura: console.log looks like javascript to me
 FrancoRoura: if (humanId == 0 || humanId == 1) {
 Westicles: 59 woods to go.  these realm puzzles look doable but too long to read
 Ajaiy: wdym by 59 woods?
 Westicles: promote to wood everywhere possible
 Ajaiy: You mean in bot programming?
 Westicles: yeah
 Ajaiy: Whoa
 vinnie_rinella: hey sorry about that i hade to go do somehting sorry for distracting you all
 vinnie_rinella: it was javascipt btw
 jacek: oh my
 vinnie_rinella: what does the || do in the code
 Wontonimo: || means "or"
 vinnie_rinella: ok
 vinnie_rinella: it still just goes back and forth its the zombie v code one it cant decide wich zombie to go after
 Wontonimo: hey vinnie_rinella, considering that is pretty intro stuff I'd recommend you do some intro to javascript course or video before doing any more here.  This site is probably a little too advanced if you are unfamiliar with the || operator
 vinnie_rinella: ok
 Wontonimo: what i mean is that || is intro.  the zombie thing isn't
 jacek: you dont need || if you make NN for that
 vinnie_rinella: yea that was just me being stupd
 Wontonimo: "you got a problem with your code?  don't debug, use NN" - jacek 
 Wontonimo: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: man, you make me feel bad for not using NN on this site jacek
 jacek: you dont? oO
 Wontonimo: keep up the reminders... I need the kick in the pants 
 Emmus: hey, anyone know, if I can use ,,&amp;" in python, when you compare two booleans?
 Wontonimo: ,,&amp;"&#160;?  what does that do?
 Emmus: like ,,and" but with one character
 Wontonimo: do you mean the &amp; operator?  if so, then yes
 Emmus: yes, thx
 jacek: there is no &amp;&amp;. &amp; is bit(?) operator
 Wontonimo: sorry, the double comma at the beginning threw me off.
 Wontonimo: and since booleans can be dynamically case to a bit, then i believe it works
 jacek: welp you can do if False &amp; True:
 Wontonimo: you can also use the + or * operator like soa * b == 1  # is like a &amp; b == True
 Emmus: I google it, and &amp; its bitwise operator&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yes, jacek said that earlier
 jacek: but no one listens
 Emmus: sorry, my bad
 Wontonimo: I listen jacek, that's all that matters
 Wontonimo: :taco: jacek :hug:
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded jacek 10 tacos. jacek now has 50 taco. Wontonimo now has 39 taco
 jacek: shall i make next tutorial with genetic algorithm for search race? :thinking:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/a52fbn">https://streamable.com/a52fbn</a>
 Wontonimo: oh, that's really good!
 Wontonimo: yes please
 Wontonimo: I don't think my GA for search race is that good so I'd love to see your tricks
 Wontonimo: how would you describe your GA?  Crossover strategy?  Mutation strategy? Population size?  Fitness function?
 Wontonimo: that slide into ckpt 1 is fantastic
 jacek: my basic fitness was something like 10000 * checkpoints done - distance to next checkpoint
 jacek: but fitness with distance to next checkpoint - 3 * vel is much better
 Wontonimo: :grin: clever!
 jacek: the number at the top is number of generations <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/619298929">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/619298929</a>
 jacek: as you can see from streamable, for abut 50 first generations it explores more - bigger mutation rate. then later mutation rate is smaller to exploit and it pays off
 Wontonimo: oh, not that many generations!  That's good to know
 Wontonimo: almost like an annealing process
 Wontonimo: that's a nice twist and optimization
 jacek: my population size is 100, each genome contains 16 moves. i didnt discreeted, it allows all moves -18,18 angle and 0,200 thrust
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder marathon delayed by a few hours, should have started 10min ago
 jacek: i have never done SA, i only did GA. i have some intuition regarding its hyperparameters
 vinnie_rinella:  how do i get the location of human 1 and human 2 separeatly 
 eulerscheZahl: what game are you playing?
 vinnie_rinella: zombies v coders
 eulerscheZahl: code vs zombies?
 vinnie_rinella: yea that one
 eulerscheZahl: you get them one by one. just store them in a list or an array
 vinnie_rinella: i still dont see how that separates it 
 eulerscheZahl: humans = empty listfor i = 0 to humanCount-1
 eulerscheZahl: now you have all of them
 vinnie_rinella: can you make in code form 
 eulerscheZahl: which language?
 eulerscheZahl: checking your profile, i assume JavaScript?
 Uljahn: eulerscheScript
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ddbe3d1-ddad-4d93-8c3e-03e2a9148ba7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ddbe3d1-ddad-4d93-8c3e-03e2a9148ba7</a>
 eulerscheZahl: also: thanks Uljahn, would have expected that kind of comment from MK
 Uljahn: ye, miss him too
 eulerscheZahl: i don't
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather take CyberPunk back
 Uljahn: :sweat_smile:
 vinnie_rinella: thanks
 Cybergoth: Aye, i´m kinda newbie so, based in your experience, what´s the most effective way to become problem solver? I´m having a real hard time with the matter. Thx in advance 
 vinnie_rinella: THE ALL POWERFUL GOOGLE
 vinnie_rinella: that is the best way
 eulerscheZahl: google that guides you to stackoverflow
 Cybergoth: Iwill take a look, i´ve been using books but 
 eulerscheZahl: whatever fits you best. i learned from a book + lectures at university. but that was some years ago, now there are also great youtube tutorials available
 eulerscheZahl: the most important part: get your hands dirty and do some coding yourself while learning. don't just accept it after reading/watching
 jacek: find a problem and solve it
 DavidSOLOME: Hello
 Joosy199: Heyo
 Darleanow: Hello again evry1 
 jacek: :scream:
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 Darleanow: gimme love jacek&#160;:)
 jacek: :kiss_mm:
 Darleanow: this is better.
 Darleanow: imma finna debug this code&#160;!
 Darleanow: if its not finished in 3 hours
 Darleanow: i'll give everything i own to Wonto 
 Darleanow: and a bit for you because you gave me a kiss UwU
 jacek: eat :taco:
 Darleanow: bot seems down
 Darleanow: drop :taco:
 Joosy199: Some of these clash of code games seemed rigged XD if you use python you can do the tasks in less code
 Darleanow: ruby is the worst tbh
 jacek: dont bring knife to a gun fight
 Darleanow: xDDD
 21stCenturyPeon: At this point, I'm just assuming they release a new Python update every time someone publishes a new CoC puzzle, with the solution as its own function
 jacek: there was coc about making every word start with capital letter

 Darleanow: hey jacek
 Darleanow: could u give me just a clue, about whats going wrong there

 Darleanow: error code @ del secondlist[indexing] 
 Darleanow: out of range
 Darleanow: pls --'
 jacek: where out of range. in del?
 Darleanow: yeah indeed
 jacek: so indexing is &gt;= size of secondlist
 Darleanow: if indexing==len(secondlist):
 Darleanow: but i'm checking if it is superior
 Darleanow: just after i add 1 to indexing
 Darleanow: so if it's equal, it breaks the while loop because of the looping becoming 0
 jacek: but according to your prints, you should see the indexing and len of secondlist is the same&#160;:?
 Darleanow: EXACTLY AT THE END
 jacek: what if it goes into if int(onenumberless)%d==0 during last indexing
 jacek: after this if and else print something and see
 Not_Sorrb: why did i get unbanned
 Darleanow: OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 
 Darleanow: ITS BC I APPEND IT TO SOLUTIONS COUNT
 Not_Sorrb: OHHH OFCOURSE
 Not_Sorrb: U UNSMART FELLA
 Not_Sorrb: joking
 Darleanow: indeed now it's fixed
 Darleanow: jacek, my hero
 Darleanow: drop :muchlove:

 Wontonimo: turn off caps lock
 Darleanow: wonto, the mean  boy is back
 Darleanow: i mean sorb, not you obv&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: Not_Sorrb, are you going to play nice?
 Darleanow: 2 corrects out of 5 lets goooo
 Nik05: I just got a notification that I received a message. Where can I find this message?
 Nik05: But I can't find the message back in the notification log...

 Darleanow: a-Rye *drops taco*
 Darleanow: :0
 a-Rye: Ah, but Darleanow I drop it with Style! My Style is now a whopping 1
 Darleanow: If you need style, ask for Wontonimo
 Darleanow: He's the star in the middle of the dancefloor
 a-Rye: and to antiwonto, he's the almighty creator
 Darleanow: This is exactly correct
 Darleanow: everybody loved him, he needed ennemies
 Darleanow: and antiwonto became
 Nik05: Thank you a-Rye :P

 Nik05: Anyone done Buster II, it feels like test case 9 is wrong...
 Nik05: I mean Blunder episode I
 Darleanow: I DID EHEHH
 Nik05: The testcase called Broken wall. If i read the rules this will result in a loop and should not finished
 Darleanow: jk i don't know what u're talking about
 Nik05: The puzzle Blunder Episode 1
 Darleanow: i didn't do it unfortunately&#160;:)
 Uljahn: the name of the testcase gives you a hint, also there are beers on the map
 Not_Sorrb: deez nuts
 Darleanow: IS IT depressed robot&#160;?
 Not_Sorrb: wa
 Uljahn: Not_Sorrb: you've been warned, next is a ban
 Not_Sorrb: i already got bnned
 Not_Sorrb: but for somereason im unbanned
 Darleanow: so it was a kick not a ban&#160;:)
 Darleanow: Uljahn IVE ALMOST FINISHED
 Not_Sorrb: not today smartie
 Not_Sorrb: it was like a week ago or sumthin
 Nik05: Uljahn yes, i am drinking correctly, but when you are at 'S" for the second time your next direction is South. And because buster is now not drunk he cannot move and therefore needs to go to the next direction, which is East because he is not inverted
 Not_Sorrb: thats cuz ur not doing it write
 Uljahn: Nik05: you can analyze the solution for the testcase by enabling expert mode in the settings on the left
 Nik05: Yes, for some reason it goes East while being on a 'S', i think that is incorrect...
 Uljahn: nope
 Not_Sorrb: ratio
 Nik05: oh it isnt doing that
 Uljahn: ot goes south 4 times breaking the wall and turning east on the second B
 Uljahn: If Blunder is in Breaker mode and passes over a beer again, then he immediately goes out of Breaker mode.
 Uljahn: *it
 Darleanow: when will [CG] add a /ignore function&#160;?
 Uljahn: never
 Darleanow: why&#160;?
 Nik05: Oops sorry
 Darleanow: some ppl really do be annoying there
 Uljahn: too hard to maintain this xmpp-based chat
 Not_Sorrb: ratio tbh

 Darleanow: im almost there&#160;!
 Nik05: I forgot to break the wall, but damn this making calculating loops pretty intensive
 Nik05: *expensive
 Nik05: To detect a loop you need to check if the state has been in before, breaking a wall is also a new state. So you also need to included the map into a hash set
 Nik05: Or am I wrong with this?
 Uljahn: dirty hack: if a path is longer than 200 steps it might be a loop
 Nik05: Yes, but that is dirty :P
 Nik05: Guess I will include list of broken obstecles in my state
 Nik05: obstecles, wtf 
 Nik05: obstacles, thats it
 Nik05: Pronounce it in another language than English and then you know how to correctly spell it :P
 Nik05: Now only that damn teleporter...
 Darleanow: ONE LINE AWAY FROM SUCCESS GUYS
 Darleanow: 80% WTF
 Nik05: What puzzle are you doing?
 Darleanow: largest number
 Darleanow: idk why but my program removes two 
 Darleanow: for ONLY one
 Darleanow: test
 antiwonto: [auto] 'test' was defined as ' this is a test '
 Darleanow: so i will add another layer of script
 Nik05: I haven't solved that one :P
 Darleanow: ahaha
 Darleanow: its way harder than it looks tbh
 Darleanow: or to me
 Nik05: "Easy"
 Darleanow: NO ITS NOT
 Darleanow: THE OTHERS ARE EASY
 Darleanow: only 73%wr
 Darleanow: and only 200 finished it
 Darleanow: even murder in the village has more ppl completed it
 Nik05: Ok, it's not that trivial but should be doable :P
 Nik05: 2 &lt;= d &lt;= 10

 Darleanow: oh nvm you're nnot using py
 Darleanow: and yeah it's kinda hard for me
 Nik05: i can read some python
 Darleanow: i mean i've coded it into noob python so u should be able to understand it then 
 Darleanow: i used clear var names
 Darleanow: so it's easier
 Nik05: i dont get that paste
 Darleanow: ah crap
 Nik05: Doesnt look like everything?
 Darleanow: wdym&#160;?
 Nik05: I don't get your first line.
 Darleanow: okay, you begin with a list
 Nik05: thirdList = list(lst)? where is lst coming from?
 Darleanow: lst is coming from number
 Darleanow: ive put it in list
 Darleanow: that was easier to me
 Nik05: but where is your number = int(input())&#160;?
 Darleanow: wait, heres the whole code

 Darleanow: ive sent you before only the one to check for remove 2 digits
 Nik05: Ah yeah looks like beginner code :P
 Darleanow: &gt;:(
 Darleanow: i will make it better
 Darleanow: first, i'm doing all the easy ones
 Darleanow: thennnnn i go for optimizing
 Nik05: If you solve it, I wouldn't "optimize" but refactor to more understandable code
 Darleanow: aight sir&#160;:)
 Nik05: And use functions to give meaning to code. That helps a lot
 Darleanow: yeah wonto told me that
 Darleanow: but i want to keep it basic at most
 Nik05: If you have understandable code, you can always try to optimize 
 TheHereticalSponge_f08d: ah
 TheHereticalSponge_f08d: hey
 Nik05: Darleanow but do you need any specific help?

 Darleanow: this part isnt working
 Darleanow: and my brain is lagging 
 Nik05: since you didn't put it in a function with a name, what should it do?
 TheHereticalSponge_f08d: lags brain
 TheHereticalSponge_f08d: ok
 Darleanow: basically its appending a solution if we remove two number and THIS number%d==0
 Nik05: Hm i just completed it
 Darleanow: okay,basically i'd just like to cry
 Darleanow: i'm so bad this is terryfying
 Darleanow: terrifying
 Nik05: No, you are just starting, right?
 Darleanow: i've started like two months ago maybe 
 Darleanow: something like this
 Darleanow: yeah, two months ago, checked on my git repo lol
 Nik05: ok, good
 Darleanow: no not good, i can't see my improvment
 Darleanow: this is frustrating&#160;:/
 Nik05: Well, the code is quite confusing for me, so I guess it will also confuse yourself :P
 Nik05: Have you done the first test case?
 Darleanow: basically
 Darleanow: i have 80%
 Darleanow: only the 2 remove isn't completed
 Darleanow: the only problem is the loop for the two digits 
 Nik05: How do you create those pastes?
 Darleanow: ctrl c your code
 Darleanow: then ctrl v it here
 Nik05: oh ok
 Darleanow: but don't give me the answer
 Darleanow: i'd just like help if possible&#160;:)
 Nik05: I would first structure the code to show what you are doing
 Nik05: So first check if the number itself is divisible, if it is print the number and you are done
 Nik05: Those should be a few lines of code
 Darleanow: i have it for no digits to change and one to change
 Nik05: If it does not divide, you can create a list where each element is the number from with the nth digit is removed. 
 Darleanow: did too
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8bfe7a3-c418-460d-a310-f81719127192">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8bfe7a3-c418-460d-a310-f81719127192</a>
 Nik05: You can make a function for this, really break things up into smaller pieces
 Darleanow: this is what i tried to do
 Darleanow: first, loop
 Darleanow: then create str
 Darleanow: then add number in string and compare them
 Darleanow: if divisible, add to res
 Darleanow: then
 Darleanow: compare res to find the highest value
 Nik05: First case could be really easy:
 Nik05: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7308b5c-17c1-4ad1-bb08-7549f382f82e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c7308b5c-17c1-4ad1-bb08-7549f382f82e</a>
 Darleanow: indeed, i have this
 Nik05: Doesn't need any of the other variables you are creating
 Darleanow: and this is not right,tho, it's hardcoded
 Darleanow: because there might be two number divisble by d
 Darleanow: and IF they are
 Darleanow: youre gonna print 2
 Nik05: You need to print the largest number, if the first number is the divisible it is the largest, because all other number with a digit removed are smaller
 Darleanow: OH FUCK YEAH IM RETARDED SRY

 Darleanow: oops
 Darleanow: sry wonto
 Nik05: Just a bot
 Darleanow: ik xd
 Darleanow: but it's an habit that i have xd
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 Nik05: I have to say that removing a character from a string is not that easy in python
 Nik05: I would create a function for that Darleanow
 Nik05: Darleanow do you know how functions work?
 Darleanow: i do&#160;!!!
 Darleanow: but, i wanna do without&#160;:)
 Darleanow: ik i'm kinda weird
 Darleanow: im about to finish it
 Nik05: ok
 Darleanow: nevermind, the loop seems fixed
 Darleanow: but it's not xd
 Darleanow: even tho its working with only my two digits loop check
 Nik05: Haven't used python in like 20 years
 Nik05: This puzzle is pretty nice
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 Darleanow: forfeit
 Nik05: finished it with 11 lines of code :P
 Nik05: sorry, dont let that distract you
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 Nik05: I created it with functions first, it really lets you see the algorithm you are using
 Darleanow: ive deleted my whole code
 Darleanow: im starting again
 Darleanow: and not going to sleep until it'q finished
 Nik05: I also calculated the problem for the number, numbers with one removed and numbers with two removed seperatly
 Nik05: After that all worked it tried to refactor the code, so i removed duplicate code
 Nik05: Darleanow please make functions, and clearly state what they are doing
 Darleanow: okay&#160;!!
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54b12add-b338-4568-811b-bd76c69a6381">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54b12add-b338-4568-811b-bd76c69a6381</a>
 Darleanow: not working --'
 Nik05: please use spaces...
 Nik05: What does your function need to calculate?
 Darleanow: checks for no num change
 Darleanow: prints number if number%d==0
 Nik05: What does "no num change" mean?
 Darleanow: first test of the puzzle
 Nik05: Oh, well don't create functions for specific test cases, only if you are writing tests
 Nik05: Use functions that mean something
 Nik05: I had a function "is_divisible_by(number, d)" and "remove_char(string, index)"
 Nik05: Your function should do small pieces of your algorithm that you need to model the problem
 Darleanow: okay i see
 Nik05: Forexample:
 Nik05: def is_divisible_by(number, d): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d941674e-d4dd-4ed3-8dfa-7861962f126d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d941674e-d4dd-4ed3-8dfa-7861962f126d</a>
 Nik05: So after this what is a step in the algorithm you need to do?
 Nik05: Also dont be affraid to break up a function in multiple other functions
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3843406-eb08-4d4e-bebd-ab4470b255e1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3843406-eb08-4d4e-bebd-ab4470b255e1</a>
 Nik05: Can you explain in english what you need to do for the second test case?
 Darleanow: atl u have this
 Darleanow: first if will be function 1
 Nik05: Sorry what do you mean?
 Darleanow: i mean only one number check
 Nik05: And what do you need to do for the second test?
 Nik05: Can you describe the algorithm you want to use?
 Darleanow: two numbers check
 Darleanow: okay
 Darleanow: wait let me use my brain
 Nik05: Solving these puzzles isn't just programming, you need create an algorithm
 Nik05: Just at a high level first, what do you need to do when the number itself isn't divisible by d?
 Darleanow: remove number[n+1]
 Nik05: In a little bit more words?
 Darleanow: ill get the next digit of number and remove it 
 Nik05: But what do you need to check/calculate?
 Darleanow: if number with sliced n is divisible by n
 SubZeRoy9: What are the easiest challenges for people that know basic java?
 Nik05: Even at a higher level what is it that you want to calculate?
 Darleanow: if is true that number can be divided by d
 Darleanow:&#160;?
 Nik05: That is the first step, we have done to solve the first test case. But after that what we want to do is find the largest number created by removing a single digit that is divisible by d
 Darleanow: so we'll append in a list for ex for each number we find that is divisible
 Darleanow: and return the highest one 
 Nik05: And to do that we can do the following: 1. Create all numbers by removing a single digit from the first number. 2. Filter those numbers by the numbers that are divisible by d. 3. Find the maximum number of those divisible by d
 Nik05: Yes
 Darleanow: print(str(number)[:2])
 Darleanow: I GOT SOMETHING
 Nik05: So can you now write this algorithm down? You dont have to do everything. If some part of the algorithm is difficult or unknown at the  moment, you can create a function and just call that
 Nik05: Yes you can use slices to remove a character from a string. This is kind of difficult to do in python. THere isnt a string.remove(i) function
 Nik05: Do you have python installed don your PC?
 Darleanow: yes i do
 Nik05: I would create a function who's only job is to remove a character at some index and return this string
 Nik05: And try that out first 
 Nik05: Or you could do this in the CG ide, by using debug prints
 Nik05: i guess you can also just do it in CG IDE
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5e6fddb1-8740-41f7-9819-1de7affcd6bc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5e6fddb1-8740-41f7-9819-1de7affcd6bc</a>
 Nik05: Try to put all the login inside the function
 Darleanow: login&#160;?
 ycsvenom: i love translating code between languages :relieved:
 Darleanow: brb, ill go smoke, this is too frustrating
 Nik05: oh im tired, all the logic
 Darleanow: idk why, but i can't do it
 Darleanow: like 
 Darleanow: wtf is wrong w me
 ycsvenom: what do you want?
 Nik05: you are just starting with programming, it is hard when you are just starting
 ycsvenom: what's your problem Darleanow?
 Darleanow: im frustrated because i've spent the whole day trying to solve an easy problem, wrote 2k chars ,passed all the test and didn't got the 100%
 PainEXE: sajhgEnd of line (\n)
 PainEXE: the hell

 Nik05: not working...
 ycsvenom: which puzzle
 Darleanow: largest number
 Darleanow: brb Nik05 imma smoke
 Darleanow: i need toxic air
 PainEXE: im so confused on how i just got a puzzle right
 Nik05: ok
 RawSauce50: what are you guys up to?
 ycsvenom: i didn't solve yeti will solve it and then back to you if you up
 Nik05: Darleanow try to do this next
 Nik05: def remove_char(string, index): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f4ede67-d269-499f-b541-ed475e610e77">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f4ede67-d269-499f-b541-ed475e610e77</a>
 Darleanow: what is assert&#160;?
 Darleanow: aight ycsvenom
 Nik05: Will create an error when the stuff behind it is false
 Nik05: Its just to test your function for now, you can remove it later
 ycsvenom: assert is a statement that check a condition if that condition is true nothing happens and the program continue to execute else it will throw an AssertExeption
 Darleanow: Nik05, idk why, but i can't do it
 Darleanow: i'm trying to use my brain
 ycsvenom: it's recommended for debugging only
 Darleanow: im really trying
 Darleanow: but i can't
 Nik05: Well that function is not that easy, i can just give you the code
 Darleanow: aight lets go&#160;!
 Nik05: def is_divisible_by(number, d): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/beb630bf-81c1-4417-b04c-61aebe3cce34">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/beb630bf-81c1-4417-b04c-61aebe3cce34</a>
 Nik05: Now try to write down the steps of the algorithm
 Darleanow: okay i will try
 Nik05: I wrote the steps down:
 Nik05: def is_divisible_by(number, d): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/577f4a03-5385-4465-ba7d-f41739b0083c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/577f4a03-5385-4465-ba7d-f41739b0083c</a>
 Darleanow: def remove_char(string, index):
 Nik05: No, it does what the function say it does. It removed a character from string at index
 Nik05: it removes*
 Nik05: It works with slices, you should check that out later
 Nik05: for now just use that function
 Darleanow: elif remove_char(number,d):
 Nik05: What is your idea for the first step?
 Darleanow: like so&#160;?
 Nik05: No remove_char gives you back a new string with a digit removed
 Nik05: It does not do more than that
 Darleanow: i used like so:
 Darleanow: n=1
 Darleanow: else:print(remove_char(number,n))
 Nik05: and what does that print?
 Darleanow: 7659
 Darleanow: for n=1
 Darleanow: and 7259 for n=2
 Nik05: Ok, so now you have one number with a digit removed. What do you need to do to create all numbers with a digit removed?
 Nik05: you can make a for loop
 Darleanow: a list&#160;!!!!!!!
 Nik05: do you that list indices start from 0. So the first element is lst[0], second element is lst[1]
 Darleanow: for i in range(len(number)):
 Nik05: good, but the for i in range(...) already takes care of incrementing the index. So remove n and just use i
 Darleanow: for i in range(len(number)):
 Nik05: Another important aspect in programming is naming variables.
 Darleanow: removed the i+=1 tho
 Nik05: You dont need to increment i with `i += 1`, 
 Nik05: ok
 Nik05: So do not name the list "lst" but something meaningful
 Darleanow: now it's onedigitrm
 Nik05: Forexample: "numbers_on_digit_removed"
 Nik05: for now just spell everyything out
 Nik05: on =&gt; one
 Darleanow: okay its now numbers_on_digit_removed
 Nik05: good
 Nik05: do use "one" not "on", that was a typo :P
 Darleanow: yeah ive changed&#160;!:)
 Nik05: Can you show me the code?
 ycsvenom: Darleanow
 ycsvenom: i have finished it
 ycsvenom: what is your question?
 Darleanow: why this wasn't working&#160;:
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e9b716ac-9ec1-49aa-ad2b-c9fc84ebbc84">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e9b716ac-9ec1-49aa-ad2b-c9fc84ebbc84</a>
 Darleanow: for i in range(len(number)):
 Darleanow: the blank is for Nik05
 Nik05: Can you paste the whole code?
 Darleanow: def is_divisible_by(number, d): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70191d53-c819-4896-ad57-d74e6be2c6ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70191d53-c819-4896-ad57-d74e6be2c6ae</a>
 Darleanow: removed n=0 tho
 Nik05: Ok, that is good. Remove stuff that is not needed.
 Darleanow: def is_divisible_by(number, d): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/43182bff-af2c-4aa3-9366-bebf3b267e94">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/43182bff-af2c-4aa3-9366-bebf3b267e94</a>
 Darleanow: here we go
 ycsvenom: the problem says that they might remove 0,1 or 2 digits
 ycsvenom: in the code you just removed one digit
 Nik05: Also declare variables as late as possible. In old C you needed to declare everything at the start of a function. You dont need to do that in pythong
 Darleanow: okay sir&#160;!!
 Darleanow: but why&#160;?
 Nik05: That makes reading the code easier to follow
 Darleanow: okay&#160;!!
 Nik05: Also use space and enters&#160;;)
 Nik05: def is_divisible_by(number, d): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d150c55c-c86f-4fd7-89a3-3f11f40352e4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d150c55c-c86f-4fd7-89a3-3f11f40352e4</a>
 Nik05: See what i have changed
 Nik05: So now you got the first step in the algorithm. What can you do with the others?
 Darleanow: u added this&#160;: print(numbers_one_digit_removed)
 ycsvenom: that code is overdone
 ycsvenom: you don't have to declare a function for modding
 Nik05: what do you mean ycsvenom?
 ycsvenom: modding is operation so you don't have to make a new operation out of it
 ycsvenom: you made a function named is_divisible_by which is not useful
 Nik05: "modding" or calculating the remainder of a division is indeed an operation. It can be really useful to create a function that explicitly tells what it is doing
 Nik05: Especially for something that is just starting out it can be easier to see is_divisible_by() then "int(number)&#160;% d == 0"
 Nik05: There is nothing wrong with making short functions
 ycsvenom: you don't have to create a function for everythingin this way your code will lose performance for something that is already readable
 Darleanow: for i in numbers_one_digit_removed:
 Darleanow: I DID IT 
 ycsvenom: congratulations
 Darleanow: its not the end yet tho xD
 Darleanow: 2 of the 5
 ycsvenom: :cry:
 Darleanow: Nik05 LEFT ME
 Nik05: ycsvenom premature optimalization. No problem in creating a function
 Darleanow: ah he's back
 Nik05: Good Darleanow&#160;!
 Nik05: now you need to find the largests of those numbers&#160;;)
 Darleanow: okay&#160;!
 ycsvenom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5bef736f-4f0a-4a28-921e-195878f4b562">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5bef736f-4f0a-4a28-921e-195878f4b562</a>
 Nik05: So there are now two options, you either create a new list with only divisors and after that you go to step 3 and calculate the maximum of those. Or you keep track of the largest divisor and update it in the for loop
 Nik05: Creating functions with meaningful names is a lot better than comments everywhere&#160;;)
 Nik05: And if you have really computing heavy code, well yes then you can look at optimalizatioons
 Nik05: But not this problem :P
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/96326710-f89b-43c3-b794-6f43b08724e3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/96326710-f89b-43c3-b794-6f43b08724e3</a>
 Darleanow: okay&#160;!!
 Nik05: Good! There is still a bug, but you will find that in the next test case&#160;;)
 Darleanow: if len(divisible_is_max)&gt;=1:
 Darleanow: to check if solutions or no
 Nik05: i think max will throw an error when a list is empty
 Darleanow: this is why i check the len of it
 ycsvenom: Nik05 if this your standards then i have to ask did you make an add , subtract, multiply or division before :expressionless:
 Nik05: you can use max(divisibles, default=0) to return 0 if the list is empty
 Nik05: ycsvenom yes i did for vectors
 Darleanow: wdym Nik05
 ycsvenom: vectors is different than ordinary numbers
 Nik05: ycsvenom i think everyone know what "+" means. Not everyone, especially beginners, know what "x&#160;% d == 0" means. 
 ycsvenom: vectors must have operationsand it's better to make special operations for it to make code more readable likevecA+vecB not vecA.add(vecB)
 Nik05: Darleanow your solution is good! 
 Darleanow: I DO 
 Darleanow: know what modulo is
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 Nik05: well it's not modulo, it's the remainder of a division
 Darleanow: a friend told me it was modulo
 Darleanow: the remainder of a division
 Nik05: And it was just an example. If it is clear what it is doing you can always inline the function. But you should not be afraid to create function, even for single lines of code
 Darleanow: okay i will remind this
 Nik05: But see that now your code is really clear what it is doing?
 Darleanow: first function to see if is divisible by d
 Darleanow: then remove char function
 Darleanow: then if is divisible, we print result
 ycsvenom: readability is good when professionals can easily read your code you don't have to care about beginners because they don't understand code well enough to read it 
 ycsvenom: :sweat_smile:
 Darleanow: then we append to a list number with a removed char
 Darleanow: then we check if we can divide the numbers with a removed char by d
 Nik05: That doesn't make sense. Readability is great for beginners
 Darleanow: if yes we put them in a new list
 Darleanow: then if we have results, we print the highest value
 Darleanow: else we print 0
 Nik05: So now you can do something similar for remove 2 digits
 Darleanow: return string[:index] + string[index + 1:]
 Darleanow: i dont understand this line very well
 ycsvenom: v%3==0 is globally readableyou are the only human complaining about it's readability :slight_smile:
 Darleanow: for me, we take two from str
 Nik05: ycsvenom as i said, it was an example
 Nik05: Darleanow you still have a list with all numbers with one digit removed. You can loop over these and then per number you can do the same what you did with removing one digit
 Darleanow: for i in numbers_one_digit_removed:
 Darleanow: like so&#160;?
 Nik05: You want to loop over the number, and then loop over some index to remove digits from that number
 Nik05: Like this?
 Nik05: for number in numbers_one_digit_removed:
 Nik05: And I guess you will be almost done then&#160;;)
 Nik05: If you have solved all test cases, you can then always try to find some duplicate code.
 Nik05: But if you only duplicated code twice, and arent going to use it again. You can always just leave it the way it is
 Nik05: But it can be a great exercise to improve code maintenance
 Darleanow: it removes 2 numbers from 7265 now
 Darleanow: i need to find a way to do otherwise
 Nik05: But dont try to optimize everything, readabilty is much more import than then CPU potentially executing less cycles...
 Nik05: important*
 Nik05: Darleanow where are you stuck now?
 Darleanow: it always creates a second list
 Darleanow: OH NVM IK

 Nik05: def is_divisible_by(number, d): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed1054c7-9b78-4db1-af4a-cea96c8827b2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed1054c7-9b78-4db1-af4a-cea96c8827b2</a>
 Nik05: And declare variables where you are going to use them&#160;;) I saw you putting variables in the top of the function again :P
 Darleanow: naughty me
 Darleanow: idk why i do this
 Nik05: And if you want to see what my solution was :P
 Nik05: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7410050-d64b-40e5-83f0-e82215ec5dc1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7410050-d64b-40e5-83f0-e82215ec5dc1</a>
 Nik05: But your code is better
 Darleanow: I PREFER YOURS
 Darleanow: I LOVE GOLFING
 Nik05: Like I said, it is better to use describing functions. Although mine uses variables that have meaningful names and therefore you can still follow what is happening
 Nik05: And my solutions also calculates all numbers with 3 digits removed, which it doesnt need to do...
 Darleanow: id like to be as good as u 
 Nik05: Continue doing puzzles and really try to clearly write down an algorithm and use clean code
 Darleanow: okay sir&#160;! i'll do my best
 Darleanow: i'll try to do one per day
 Darleanow: tomorrow will be asteroids
 Nik05: And then you will find new python syntax, like i used. Search for list comprehensions if you want to know more
 Nik05: I know those from Haskell, and thought python also supported those. 
 Darleanow: okay i will
 Nik05: Even though i havent programmed in python for years, it is experience in other languages as well that you can use
 Darleanow: thanks sir&#160;!
 Darleanow: i know that theres a few similarities
 Darleanow: between all of them
 Nik05: But you just started out, so there is nothing wrong not knowing how to do thing&#160;;)
 Darleanow: ik, but i don't like to fail
 Darleanow: i hate failing
 Darleanow: and i hate MattDESTROYER for creating this one too.
 Darleanow: aight Nik05, i don't have tacos to give you, but i enjoyed spending all this time with you
 Nik05: And dont forget to check out other solutions, like Uljahn
 Darleanow: thanks for your patience, sincerely
 Darleanow: Yeah&#160;! i've watched some, and its impressing
 Nik05: He has a nice solution as well. And uses a function for divisible_by as well ycsvenom&#160;;)
 xxd: hello
 Nik05: Darleanow :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] Nik05 has awarded Darleanow 3 tacos. Darleanow now has 6 taco. Nik05 now has 4 taco
 Nik05: hello xxd
 ycsvenom: why don't you check my solution if Nik05 and show me yours?
 xxd: i need to keep myself busy for the next weeks man
 Darleanow: Nik05 :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] Darleanow has awarded Nik05 5 tacos. Nik05 now has 9 taco. Darleanow now has 7 taco
 Darleanow: hehe&#160;!
 Nik05: Darleanow :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry Nik05 but you can only award tacos once per day
 Nik05: oh
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 Darleanow: tomorrow&#160;!!
 Darleanow: i'll be online everyday
 Darleanow: i really enjoy coding&#160;:)
 Darleanow: imm check ycsvenom
 Darleanow: which lang&#160;?
 Darleanow: i can't see it
 Nik05: And sometimes you are just really stuck on a problem. Come back to it later :P
 ycsvenom: python too
 ycsvenom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3c9c68e-3d07-4b57-a5b5-416320edfd5e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3c9c68e-3d07-4b57-a5b5-416320edfd5e</a>
 Nik05: You need to publish it for others to see
 Darleanow: i like this&#160;: [::-1]
 Darleanow: like ppl using this, it looks fun
 ycsvenom: it's a shorthand for reverse
 Darleanow: okay i see 
 Darleanow: i really need to sleep guys, but thanks so much for everything again&#160;!!&#160;:)
 ycsvenom: Nik05show me yours
 ycsvenom: paste it here
 Nik05: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fea1238-4521-4386-b479-617c4fabc7df">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fea1238-4521-4386-b479-617c4fabc7df</a>
 Darleanow: gn every1
 Darleanow: &lt;3
 Nik05: have a goodnight Darleanow
 Nik05: What do you think ycsvenom?
 ycsvenom: i see that you code is more general than minewhich can solve higher n without much work
 ycsvenom: your*
 Nik05: I first had functions for some stuff, and duplicated code. Then really easy to generalise
 ycsvenom: nice solution
 Nik05: functions really help seeing your algorithm in a higher level, without all the low level details
 ycsvenom: without is_divisible_by :joy:
 ycsvenom: i know big fan
 ycsvenom: i used it a lot but only where i need them
 Nik05: Although sometimes functions can hide details that could be refactor with other code. So you can always try to inline stuff, reorder, etc
 ycsvenom: every person programmed in c++ love functions
 Nik05: Every programmer should love functions...
 Nik05: Without functions we cant do anything
 ycsvenom: not exactly
 ycsvenom: we can do everything but it will harder to picture the program abstractly
 ycsvenom: will be*
 Ayza: In most cases you don't need functions but you also gotta be ready to write the same 100 lines twice for one thing
 ycsvenom: functions are just dynamic variables :slight_smile:
 Nik05: So practically you cant do anything without functions
 ycsvenom: it's variables**2
 Nik05: well you could see a constant/variable as a morphism f: t -&gt; C, where t is a terminal object
 Nik05: But yeah, not going to help us going there :P
 Nik05: although the terminal object can be seen as void or the unit tuple ()
 Nik05: So a function f: () -&gt; A, can be seen as a constant
 Nik05: void in the C language is actually a really bad name
 Nik05: Because void is not void. It inhibates a single element
 Nik05: gn
 Ayza: gn
 ycsvenom: void is great name
 ycsvenom: like "typeless"
 ASM_MOV_INT: anion

 dpdog: gilbert&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: 2^x = 20
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Wontonimo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 40 tacos
 Wontonimo: 2^x = 20
 antiwonto: [auto] x = 4.3219280948542504
 Wontonimo: 1.1^x = 20
 antiwonto: [auto] x = 31.43139882603113
 Kaelidian: oo
 Kaelidian: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 Kaelidian: whaaa
 tangent0: 22/7 = 3.14
 Wontonimo: it solves for x.  there is no x in your equation tangent0
 Wontonimo: 4x*x + 8x = (1+x)/x
 Wontonimo: well, maybe not
 Wontonimo: 4x*x + 8x = 7/x
 Wontonimo: 4x*x + 8x = (1+x)/x + 8
 Wontonimo:&#160;?? why is it broken&#160;;(
 ASM_MOV_INT: 3+x=2
 antiwonto: [auto] x = -1
 ASM_MOV_INT: x^3-5x=3.14159
 ASM_MOV_INT: 6.28x=3.14
 ASM_MOV_INT: 6x=3
 ASM_MOV_INT: hmmmm
 ASM_MOV_INT: cool though!

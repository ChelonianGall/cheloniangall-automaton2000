 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 izik1: \o
 izik1: tfw bot has an off by 1 error causing it to crash on ocassion 
 MostComplicatedUsername: euler
 MostComplicatedUsername: U in eu?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Asia?
 MostComplicatedUsername: huh
 eulerscheZahl: i'm in germany, why?
 CyberLemonade: hey can I get some strategies to start off?
 Zenoscave: filter possible possitions don't fire unless you know where they are
 CyberLemonade: hmmm
 CyberLemonade: wait is there cooldown?
 CyberLemonade: or just charge up?
 eulerscheZahl: you have to charge
 Zenoscave: charge up
 CyberLemonade: I see
 Zenoscave: but it is 0 when you can fire
 CyberLemonade: oh ok thanks
 CyberLemonade: when did it start?
 eulerscheZahl: 10 days ago
 eulerscheZahl: 21 remaining
 CyberLemonade: hmmmm
 eulerscheZahl: was announced on the same day it started
 CyberLemonade: wowow
 tempux: anybody is using minimax?
 Csipcsirip: I'm trying to implement something like that. for two days now :p 
 tempux: What language you are using?
 Csipcsirip: c++
 tempux: good, I am using python and I can't go very deep. I am thinking about switching to c++ too
 vector94: how to get only fastest mode in clash of code
 Thamminana: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/11695875e1166219ae7cdcdffef2d8b5cf1a3ae">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/11695875e1166219ae7cdcdffef2d8b5cf1a3ae</a>
 vector94: No, I just want to get only fastest mode on clash of code, because I don't like reverse and shortest mode.
 Atadolfo: there`s no way
 Csipcsirip: yeah you should definitely switch to a faster language  :p 
 izik1: Huh, that's neat
 izik1: You can hyper move
 izik1: Since you can _totally_ move &amp; silence in the same turn
 MadKnight: hihi izik1
 MadKnight: izipizik1
 Mikeeyy: In ocean of code how do i know where the islands are in my code
 struct: they give you the islands coordinates at the start
 struct: on first turn
 Zpooks: Even in wood 2&#160;?
 Zpooks: Or do they introduce that later?
 struct: on all leagues
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52121166-5faf-4351-bb44-70d10b794722">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/52121166-5faf-4351-bb44-70d10b794722</a>
 struct: that is in c++
 Zpooks: Ah, that sure could do with a comment or something
 Zpooks: But thanks&#160;:)
 struct: its default code
 Zpooks: Yes, I know, its what i meant
 Zpooks: If you just glance over the code its just a for loop reading "something" from input
 Zpooks: Thanks a lot!
 Mikeeyy: My loop just out puts the size of the board
 Mikeeyy: Where do the inputs of x's and .'s come in
 struct: i was wrong
 struct: it gives a liner
 struct: line*
 struct: of each row
 struct: if you then read that line
 struct: x is island and . is water
 Mikeeyy: Oh i am dumb
 Mikeeyy: thanks
 anid: Has anyone made a runner arena for ocean of code?
 Tunga: Greetings fellas
 Zpooks: Greetings
 wlesavo: damn, kovi, do you still go with silence N 0 i gotta counter that :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 eulerscheZahl: i can still scroll up to my message from this morning, not much chat activity today
 darkhorse64: exhausted coders or they believe the contest is over
 eulerscheZahl: it's over? i'm 6th! :tada:
 Zpooks: Im just getting into this kind of coding since yesterday, but is it a rush to first place or..?
 Zpooks: Seeing as the event is over in 20 days.
 eulerscheZahl: it's a marathon
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure top players will still improve
 Zpooks: Exciting, Im still stuck figuring out the basics in wood 2
 wlesavo: have 0 / 32 against kovi lol
 wlesavo: i hope that countering silence 0 will help for a while
 Zpooks: Cant really use any knowledge in messaging systems or microservices here.. :P
 Zpooks: Is Kovi #1?
 eulerscheZahl: i have 8/12 vs kovi but only 50% wins vs you wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: kovi is 2nd

 pb4: He's crushing me
 wlesavo: yeah, mistery to me, he is not using sonar nor clever silence
 pb4: Has anyone identified what he does&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you are even losing against me. a little rock paper scissors
 Tunga: I am pretty sure this ANEO Sponsored Puzzle' 1 case is wrong. German Highway! 
 Tunga: Anyone dare to discuss with me, I am in discord :D 
 eulerscheZahl: 6022 solvers are wrong and you are rightsounds plausible
 darkhorse64: + 1
 Tunga: When you said like that it sounds awful
 Astrobytes: PEB... oh wait, I'm not going down *that* road again...
 wlesavo: Astrobytes :grinning:
 darkhorse64: Politely said, given the number of peoeple that solved, the error is in your code. 
 darkhorse64: Sad but true.
 Tunga: The thing is, I create a formula for solving the issue, every case but 1 is confirmed by system
 darkhorse64: Either your formula has an edge case or your implementation is wrong
 Tunga: LOL 
 Tunga: I solved 
 Tunga: Edge cases :p
 darkhorse64: 6023 people solved it&#160;!
 Tunga: But, I might said that, edge cases are wrong 
 RoboStac: are you using floating point calculations?
 Tunga: I am sure about it
 RoboStac: one of the tests hits an accuracy issue
 Tunga: [0-15) 
 Tunga: [0-15) green[15-30) red light 
 Tunga: They took the 15 inclusive to green light
 Tunga: 15 should be red light 
 Tunga: [0-15) green[15-30) red light  this is true case
 Tunga: Instead game is like [0-15] green (15-30) red
 RoboStac: so what speed do you think should work?
 Tunga: [ &lt;- inclusive ( &lt;- exclusive 
 Tunga: In german 120 is working 
 Tunga: But it expect 60 
 Tunga: I even calculate it myself
 RoboStac: at 120 you reach the second light after 90 seconds, just as it goes red
 Tunga: It goes exactly in 90 second which is okay?
 Tunga: or you mean it is like 90.1 
 RoboStac: exactly 90, which is when it changes 
 Tunga: Wow, yes
 Tunga: You are right like 6022 people 
 Tunga: :p 
 Tunga: Thanks for the explanation, I cant see my errors like always
 wlesavo: anti kovi submit played only 2 battles against him, lost both, but overall did pretty ok 
 wlesavo: im sure it wont be 0/32 anymore :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: isn't valcodi the bigger worry?
 Illedan: Is the page slow or is it only me?
 AntiSquid: where's the mlch guy&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: nah, we decided to let him win
 wlesavo: AntiSquid have reasonable winrate against him
 eulerscheZahl: at 19 AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ah i see now he dropped
 eulerscheZahl: a new submit
 wlesavo: like 4/1 last submit
 eulerscheZahl: was around 3 or 4 before i think
 AntiSquid: he was jumping up and down
 AntiSquid: even 1st place
 wlesavo: oh, its 3/2 actually, still ok
 wlesavo: basically, i weighted candidates, with high priority to silence 0, many people still use it eventually
 wlesavo: oh, and now i realised i implemented wrong :smiley:
 icecream17: okay, overnight i stayed up until midnight because i wasnt sleepy
 icecream17: but now i have a whole page of ideas
 icecream17: and logic....
 icecream17: I wonder if I can implement something that sees if someone is silencer, torpedoer, or miner....
 icecream17: ugh all of my ideas are hard. and i have athome learning today so yeah
 icecream17: benjamin your great plan didn't work
 icecream17: 520 moves!? That's the longest game I've ever had!
 yfprojects: How long does it take for your bots to narrow opponent locations down to 5?
 eulerscheZahl: heavily depends on the opponent and map
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443770308">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443770308</a>
 yfprojects: here for example
 yfprojects: @eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: first 2 numbers of my message: me tracking opponent
 eulerscheZahl: paths and current cells
 eulerscheZahl: last 2 numbers: opponent tracking me
 yfprojects: i see
 eulerscheZahl: and when i compare my prediction of the opponent tracker and the mines that my opponent explodes, his tracker seems to be less effective than mine
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. frame 188, i can't be there according to my self-tracking
 struct: kov i back on top
 wlesavo: wow, Nagrarok plays without silence, impressing
 Csipcsirip: idk what is more annoying mine spam or silence spam
 wlesavo: ok, my antikovi vacine works now without hurting other matchups
 kovi: nice
 wlesavo: at least it is not 0/32 anymore  :slight_smile:

 kovi: meta is on
 BenjaminUrquhart: ey promotion
 Thunderbolt: Hello guys
 Thunderbolt: I have a question
 HasanMahmudRimon: say it
 Thunderbolt: Is there any free online linux environment out there?
 HasanMahmudRimon: what do you mean bu free linux environment?
 HasanMahmudRimon: *by
 BenjaminUrquhart: why online?
 Thunderbolt: I linux providers
 BenjaminUrquhart: just boot into it or use a VM
 Thunderbolt: I mean *
 Thunderbolt: I dont have that much RAM
 HasanMahmudRimon: you need linux iso file or what?
 HasanMahmudRimon: oh..sorry
 BenjaminUrquhart: why do you need a linux env?
 eulerscheZahl: the more you clarify, the more mysterious the question becomes
 HasanMahmudRimon: but linux is demand less RAM
 HasanMahmudRimon: than windows
 Thunderbolt: Here is the problem
 HasanMahmudRimon: then use other OS
 Thunderbolt: I need to setup a big data environment but my PC doesnt have a lot of RAM for that
 HasanMahmudRimon: there are some OS lighter than linux
 BenjaminUrquhart: "big data environment" any specifics?
 BenjaminUrquhart: how much ram do you have
 Thunderbolt: Install technologies like HADOOP, HIVE,ZOOKEEPER,KAFKA,SPARK at least
 BenjaminUrquhart: and no, you're probably not going to get something for free online
 Thunderbolt: I have 8 GB
 HasanMahmudRimon: seroisly???
 BenjaminUrquhart: I run VMs all the time with that much ram
 HasanMahmudRimon: you are kidding right?
 Thunderbolt: It's not that I can't run them 
 Thunderbolt: I have a lot of different versions
 BenjaminUrquhart: and?
 HasanMahmudRimon: then use multiple os..from the boot
 Thunderbolt: But the problem is when launching Hadoop and hive ..
 HasanMahmudRimon: don't use vm
 BenjaminUrquhart: ^ dual boot
 HasanMahmudRimon: yes
 Thunderbolt: I can't do dual boot I have asus which doesnt always support linux
 HasanMahmudRimon: F**k man
 Thunderbolt: I tried it before and it crashed
 BenjaminUrquhart: no harm in trying
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh
 Thunderbolt: Tried it twice with different linux OS
 HasanMahmudRimon: hmm..asus don't support  dual boot
 Thunderbolt: Kali and parrot
 Thunderbolt: It does support dual boot but linux no
 Thunderbolt: It depends
 HasanMahmudRimon: okay..
 Thunderbolt: See my problem now
 Thunderbolt: XD
 HasanMahmudRimon: hmm..you stucked bro
 BenjaminUrquhart: have you tried something other than kali and parrot
 HasanMahmudRimon: ubuntu
 Uljahn: what about persistent live USB?
 Thunderbolt: Ubuntu 1 year ago
 HasanMahmudRimon: i know
 HasanMahmudRimon: u used ubuntu
 Thunderbolt: no i tried 1 year ago and failed XD
 HasanMahmudRimon: btw where are you from?
 BenjaminUrquhart: unless you're using some really bleeding edge or obscure hardware linux should at least boot on anything
 Thunderbolt: When I run persistent live screen freezes after a while
 BenjaminUrquhart: ram issue
 BenjaminUrquhart: and not amount
 BenjaminUrquhart: I've had that happen to me, turns out I had a bad ram card
 Thunderbolt: No Im working fine on windows
 Thunderbolt: Playing games and everything
 Thunderbolt: Even running hadoop and hive on windows
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 BenjaminUrquhart: cursed computer
 Thunderbolt: Probably XD
 BenjaminUrquhart: is this a laptop or desktop
 Thunderbolt: Yes laptop
 Thunderbolt: Asus
 eulerscheZahl: starting the indian tech support script now, BenjaminUrquhart?
 eulerscheZahl: press the windows key and the letter R as in Romeo
 BenjaminUrquhart: R
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok so a quick google search shows it's a known issue that newer asus products are incompatible with linux
 Thunderbolt: Exactly 
 eulerscheZahl: and noone at Asus considered that during the design phase?
 Thunderbolt: No idea
 Thunderbolt: NEwer products are supposed to be better but turned out the opposite for some
 BenjaminUrquhart: how old is this laptop
 Thunderbolt: XD
 Thunderbolt: 1 year old XD
 Thunderbolt: Core i7 7th Gen
 Thunderbolt: 2 graphic cards intel and Nvidia 920M
 Thunderbolt: 8 RAM
 Thunderbolt: Good things to have but doesnt support linux XD
 BenjaminUrquhart: community nvidia drivers are garbage
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok, here's a question I should have asked: define " it doesn't work"
 Thunderbolt: When booting linux it doesnt start at all
 BenjaminUrquhart: does it recognize the boot disk?
 Thunderbolt: I have uefi bios I do that manually
 BenjaminUrquhart: so you select the boot disk and then... nothing?
 Thunderbolt: Yep
 BenjaminUrquhart: just blank screen?
 Thunderbolt: Yep
 BenjaminUrquhart: but the live disk "works?"
 Thunderbolt: It freezes after almost 5 minutes from starting
 Thunderbolt: I am really disappointed on this laptop
 Thunderbolt: Never gonna buy asus again
 Thunderbolt: Thx guys for your time
 BenjaminUrquhart: make a persistent live disk and attempt to install the official nvidiad rivers in your 5 minutes
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl tech support is over
 BenjaminUrquhart: you can come back now
 eulerscheZahl: nah, busy making my boss act less like a retard
 BenjaminUrquhart: sounds good
 eulerscheZahl: in theory yesbut not successful so far
 AntiSquid: there's not enough linux support, is it because there's no money to be made out of it or because they think the linux communities will just sort out their distros themselves?
 izik1: Probably both?
 izik1: Although, as someone running Arch (I use arch btw) I haven't actually seen any problems with Linux hardware support, some people are still adamant about not supporting software for it though&#160;:/
 BenjaminUrquhart: I always assume the latter
 wlesavo: AntiSquid there are specific distributives that have an ok support for corporative versions. like redhat, or similar
 icecream17: what should I do if I have one life? sometimes the opponent also has 1 or 2 lives but sometimes 5
 eulerscheZahl: you hide in the cprner and lure him into your mine field
 izik1: going for a tie might also be a good strat
 wlesavo: it depends, you still can win, but highly unlikely
 izik1: if they have 1
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl easy to die due to surfacing i think
 icecream17: There's so much logic too. Like if the opponent is 5 away and has 2 lives, you can move, and then shoot to win.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm an expert in dying
 icecream17: wlesavo then maybe charge up silence to get out of that situation....
 wlesavo: especially if the opponent does not want to go to your minefiled
 izik1: if they have 5 and you have 1, you should probably improve your early game
 wlesavo: izi to say :wink:
 izik1: Well, all _they_ have to do is not die before you, which is quite easy for them
 icecream17: not easy. i worked on this for so long
 icecream17: I have so many ideas and so little time. 
 lNitsua: Hey I'm pretty new to C but finally got some things going. Now that I have a decently functioning bot, I was cleaning up the code and was wondering if I needed to delete structs I was done with in C?
 ZarthaxX: icecream17 20 DAYS..
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX improve your bot
 ZarthaxX: nop
 izik1: you only need to `delete` things that you allocated with `new`, if you allocated with `alloc` you need to `free`, and if you didn't allocate it'll just die at the end of the scope INitsua
 lNitsua: ok thanks!
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443770070">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443770070</a> hmmm advice?
 izik1: Try to avoid entering that top left corner?
 icecream17: can't floodfill
 izik1: reason?
 icecream17: timeout - unknown ms
 icecream17: (very very slow)
 xarnthehero: Is there a way to challenge friends directly in a battle?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, delete the defaultAI first
 eulerscheZahl: (or the boss)
 eulerscheZahl: you can only fight against players in your league and below, not above
 xarnthehero: Ahh cool, thanks euler!
 icecream17: So wait, I can play against wood?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, scroll down in the opponent selection
 izik1: Play against me play against me! :p
 izik1: (I'll totally lose)
 izik1: I have _way_ more ideas than dev time so far
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443829171">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443829171</a> yes you do
 icecream17: 4th in Wood1 almost to bronze!
 izik1: without sonar or silence lol
 izik1: I really need torp tracking too
 izik1: both mine and theirs
 eulerscheZahl: i did SILENCE once
 eulerscheZahl: but yeah, i found you much faster than you found me
 izik1: you also mined once
 izik1: going between map edges is a great way to be found
 eulerscheZahl: when the last 2 numbers of my message are "1 1", you should be able to tell where I am
 izik1: actually, I'm pretty sure you can't _not_ find me
 icecream17: izik1 your game against lasted 475 moved
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443829663">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443829663</a>
 lNitsua: since you mentioned message, what's the point of it?
 izik1: debugging?
 icecream17: debug or message
 lNitsua: oh I thought there was a difference between standard message and the debugging one
 eulerscheZahl: icecream17 your tracking seems wrong
 icecream17: yes
 wlesavo: damn, kovi, that single silence 3 helps just enough
 eulerscheZahl: by the moment you hit him with the mine, you should always know the exact position&#160;;)
 icecream17: Oh yeah! Wait, I didn't put that?
 Zenoscave: wlesavo why silence 3?
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl. Our local butcher was busy serving customers when he backed into his meat slicer; now he’s got a little behind in his work.
 icecream17: I keep hearing kovi, whos that?
 Zenoscave: ranked #1 right now
 Zenoscave: in OOC
 ZarthaxX: n1 leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: what's that Zenoscave? more bad puns? :D
 wlesavo: Zenoscave well the story is i try to counter kovi, because he is using silence 0, and he is countering my countering by adding single silence 3 at early turns
 Zenoscave: Are you detecting static silence lengths? I was wondering if anyone did that
 eulerscheZahl: my length is random
 Zenoscave: What's that eulerscheZahl? DId I get them from you?
 wlesavo: yeah, i tryed to, and then weight my candidates based on taht
 Zenoscave: Good Idea
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl mine as well
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave get what from me?
 Zenoscave: the bad pun
 wlesavo: well, tracking for silence 0 works, but because of this first one activates a little to slow
 dbdr: what's special about silence 0 wlesavo?
 wlesavo: dbdr kovi abuses it
 BenjaminUrquhart: 0
 Nan001: :x::x::x:
 dbdr: I mean it's a valid move. what does it mean to abuse it?
 wlesavo: dbdr you dont need to calculate much, and cant jump to minefields by mistake
 Zenoscave: If you only do silence 0 some bots may ignore that silence with tracking once they detirmine you only silence 0
 wlesavo: it is kinda simple and effective
 izik1: throw in some silence 1s in the direction you were already going to move :shades:
 izik1: :sunglasses:
 wlesavo: dbdr i only did that becaause my win rate against kovi was 0/32, but there are surprisingly many people using that
 wlesavo: sorry for pinging
 dbdr: np
 kovi: that is why i referred to metathere is someone who definitely play vs. 0
 icecream17: what should i do when there's 1 possibleOpp position but the opponent silences?
 kovi: (and no, its not you wlesavo)
 icecream17: Also, should I implement (silence 4 if you can)?
 eulerscheZahl: then you have up to 17 possible positions now
 wlesavo: i mean, prioritizing candidates can be helpfull anyway
 wlesavo: wanted to do that for a while, silence 0 is just an obvious task to test
 wlesavo: kovi is there many others? 
 wlesavo: probably switching to silence 1 could help for a while
 eulerscheZahl: there is silence 1, silence 2, silence 3 and silence 4
 icecream17: For each amount (1, 2, 3, 4) I test the (N S E W) to add positions
 wlesavo: i know my silence is broken, will try to fix it together with movement
 Illedan: Hi
 icecream17: Of course, if the opponent moves N, then silences next move the opponent can't SILENCE S 1, but I haven't implemented that yet
 icecream17: I have "PATH" though, which is just a string of opponent moves "NNESWSE... etc"
 wlesavo: icecream17 well if you consider opponent's path it wont givethe reduction
 icecream17: Yeah, but if the opponent did "NES" the opponent can't silence W, so that's ... wait
 icecream17: idea: Counting left, add the totals!
 izik1: I have a _lot_ more work tracking silences than I've done
 izik1: I have a huge amount of notes
 izik1: lol
 wlesavo: Illedan i wonder if your test bot would get to gold :slight_smile:
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17"TORPEDO -3 4|MOVE E TORPEDO|MSG 1,(-3 -3), XⱭ you murderer"

 wlesavo: it got to silver, soo
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: I pushed my real bot
 wlesavo: oh i see
 eulerscheZahl: how would your top bot of the first weekend rank now?
 izik1: How long has this compo been going so far?
 Illedan: I tested on saturday. Ended 30
 izik1: A week?
 Illedan: 10 days izik1
 izik1: oof, I'm really far behind
 Illedan: Not really
 Illedan: Still a long time left
 eulerscheZahl: still a lot of time to go
 Illedan: I'm taking very good time now
 eulerscheZahl: at the last marathon i missed the first half on purpose
 eulerscheZahl: as 4 weeks is a lot
 Illedan: Yeah, I'm trying to chill a little
 Illedan: To not get borred
 eulerscheZahl: let me guess: beer or whiskey?

 icecream17: than js
 BenjaminUrquhart: kamiathe I don't understand what you mean. 2 tuples refer to the same set? Is that it?
 kamiathe: python is even better than js&#160;:)
 kamiathe: Yes BenjaminUrquhart
 eulerscheZahl: that code is French :scream:
 kamiathe: I'm frensh sorry&#160;:/
 BenjaminUrquhart: I can't help right now, I need syntax highlighting for that much code
 BenjaminUrquhart: and I don't have a python ide handy rn
 kamiathe: if you remove my comment at the end, you'll see 2 identical set but in different order
 eulerscheZahl: there is one on codingame.comyou should give that website a try
 RoboStac: sets are ordered by insertion order, so converting them to tuple will mean {1, 2} is different to {2,1}
 BenjaminUrquhart: wait I missed that
 BenjaminUrquhart: "set are sort automaticaly and alphabeticaly"in most cases set means unordered unless specified in the implementation
 kamiathe: yes RoboStac but usually, set sort iterable alphabeticaly
 BenjaminUrquhart: usually is the key word here
 kamiathe: ok thx I'll try to add a sort
 kamiathe: okey my pb is solved with a sorted thx
 izik1: ohno, the codinggame editor has a different width based off of how many digits the line numbers on screen have
 kamiathe: i though set was sort alphabeticaly coz that was realy often the case:/

 kamiathe: if anyone can solve my problème, i'll be realy [thanful]*1000000
 BenjaminUrquhart: NameError: name 'thanful' is not defined
 izik1: OutOfMemoryError
 icecream17: YAS! Silver league!

 icecream17: So kovi is first... and i'm 362/369
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: 362/1000+
 BenjaminUrquhart: assuming all participants are active
 BenjaminUrquhart: which they aren't
 wlesavo: well you can count bronze and wood 1 for sure
 BenjaminUrquhart: 362/977
 BenjaminUrquhart: well now he's ahead of me so now I have to get around to more strategy
 BenjaminUrquhart: also fyi DefaultAI is a joke
 eulerscheZahl: of course it is. you are supposed to play againt real users
 BenjaminUrquhart: pretty sure most humans would time out given 50ms
 IlyasElBani: when does rank get updated&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure you don't want to submit, when each battle lasts 30min
 eulerscheZahl: which rank? specific game? global rank?
 Ahmed_Mohamed.: hello my friends
 IlyasElBani: @euler global rank
 Ahmed_Mohamed.: did you mind if anyone tell me how can i apply xor in c#
 Ahmed_Mohamed.: do
 IlyasElBani: in c++ it's the operator ^
 IlyasElBani: maybe it's the same in C#?
 Ahmed_Mohamed.: it works .. thanks:heart_eyes:
 icecream17: Default AI?
 icecream17: (silver) what's default ai?
 BenjaminUrquhart: default
 AntiSquid: people without premium membership get a downgraded boss: Default AI
 AntiSquid: icecream17
 icecream17: premium membership...?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: no ads is one of the features
 icecream17:&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: Automaton2000 has a premium membership
 Automaton2000: that was the only thing that matters
 BenjaminUrquhart: hm
 BenjaminUrquhart: exactly
 icecream17: Kovi vs me: 6 lives to none.
 BenjaminUrquhart: accurate
 Sneffy: anyone available in pm for c++ question (for csb multi)
 struct: what is your question Sneffy?
 Sneffy: should we go in pm to not flood the chat&#160;?
 AntiSquid: have you heard about ocean of code sneffy?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>
 Sneffy: yes AntiSquid i'm bronze, but i prefer playing csb for now
 AntiSquid: sneffy chat looks dead at the moment, imo you can have your conversation here right now
 Sneffy: okey thanks
 Sneffy: So in csb, i tried to implement sim with collision and it works
 Sneffy: but when i'm searching for my pods
 Sneffy: sometimes they stop doing the race and go crazy in wrong direction
 Sneffy: my score depend on the dist with next cp so it keep decreasing in the search and idk why
 Sneffy: the score keep decreasing *
 Sneffy: like it can't find a better move
 struct: The question might help other users
 struct: so i guess here its fine
 struct: Do they go "crazy" right at the start?
 Sneffy: turn 0 i hardcoded Boost cuz i didn't wanted to handle it in my search
 struct: also if your eval is just the distance to next checkpoint is normal that it wont work
 Sneffy: and after they do  race
 Sneffy: it's not only that
 Sneffy: checkponit give score too
 Sneffy: they do run great
 Sneffy: but sometimes
 Sneffy: they just leave the race
 struct: Do you have a replay?
 Sneffy: suez
 Sneffy: sure*
 Sneffy: let me find one where it bug
 Sneffy: sometimes it don't bug 
 Sneffy: doesn't*
 BenjaminUrquhart: I HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE DIVISION BY ZERO BUG
 BenjaminUrquhart: my silence handling didn't account for explosions correctly
 AntiSquid: so does it now correctly divide by zero?
 Zenoscave: It would seem so
 icecream17: Wow, this person says there 2 possible positions, but my code says "7 possible positions" and "ERROR!!!!"
 Zenoscave: which person and replay?
 icecream17: kovi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443859539">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443859539</a>
 AntiSquid: ya he has maphack
 BenjaminUrquhart: icecream17 which number in your msg shows possible positions
 Zenoscave: maphack?
 Zenoscave: joke?
 BenjaminUrquhart: his tracking is too good
 BenjaminUrquhart: he uses hacks clearly
 Sneffy: struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443861401">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443861401</a>my current code is the orange
 Zenoscave: HAXXXXXXXXXXXX
 icecream17: Mine? 1st number = positions, (coord) = starting position, [coord] = how much you moved
 struct: Sneffy do you reset your bestSolution
 struct: at the start of the turn?
 Sneffy: Move* best[DEPTH] = { new Move[DEPTH],new Move[DEPTH],new Move[DEPTH],new Move[DEPTH],new Move[DEPTH] };
 Sneffy: so i guess yea
 struct: something doesnt seem right there
 struct: So I assume depth is 5
 struct: then you also do new Move[5]&#160;?
 Sneffy: woopsi
 Sneffy: forgot to remove [5]
 BenjaminUrquhart: shouldn't it be Move** since it's an array of arrays
 AntiSquid: you missed checkpoint 2 and then went to 3 and back to 2 ... 
 BenjaminUrquhart: or am I bad at C++
 Sneffy: wait this replay doesn't have the bug
 Sneffy: should find another one
 Sneffy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443863148">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443863148</a>
 AntiSquid: well you completely leave the map
 Sneffy: yep
 AntiSquid: can you debug the bot to see why it goes where it does?
 AntiSquid: my guess would be some x y mix up in there, maybe you use 2 x-es or somesuch
 Sneffy: why some games would have no problem then
 Sneffy: i mean it's weird that it happen only sometimes
 struct: both bots run same eval right?
 AntiSquid: the other one was being weird too
 Sneffy: no struct
 AntiSquid: i didn't see any normal behavior from your games
 AntiSquid: maybe you keep adding a distance coordinate somewhere 
 AntiSquid: just read your code and do your calculations on paper
 AntiSquid: 100% sure you don't add stuff properly
 icecream17: How should I decide which direction to put my mines? [MINE N, S, E, or W]
 Sneffy: i was trying to do that since hours but i came here because i still have no idea..
 AntiSquid: you go through it step by step
 AntiSquid: output some  cerr &lt;&lt; var &lt;&lt; endl; in there see what comes out, is it what you expect?
 Sneffy: i cerr the score of my pod
 AntiSquid: no
 Sneffy: it indeed see him loosing score
 AntiSquid: it's debug
 AntiSquid: you see what a value was at a given moment
 AntiSquid: or whatever you output in there
 AntiSquid: it's not the normal output
 Sneffy: yea
 AntiSquid: yea it's helpful
 emh: I got obsessed with optimizing BFS. want to have fast BFS like pb4. came up with a seemingly smart idea. but haven't tried it out yet. can be double speed I hope. will make every neighbour lookup fast hehe. at expense of indexing
 emh: I'm out of licorice tea. started on the plain black tea. and the cherry wine. no mood for programming this evening. so idea will have to wait
 emh: the idea is basically to color the game board like a chess board. then neighbours of black are white and vice versa. so put even bits in one location and odd bits in the other and alternate. should halve the amount of bit shifts necessary at least. hope it will work out. maybe even 4 locations. x odd/even * y odd/even. will see
 pb4: You're going far emh...
 emh: hehe. yes. crazy
 izik1: I need to fix my spread algo, it's currently looping bits when I can totally use fancy cpu instructions like `tzcnt` and `lzcnt` to find stuff
 karliso: How important is performance for this contest?
 kovi: moderate
 izik1: I mean, I'm rust and I haven't timed out in the IDE yet, so, probably somewhat, but certainly not impossibly high
 kovi: at least for silver
 izik1: Probably will get more severe 
 izik1: Does Rust have a module combiner for codingame yet?
 izik1: I swear one existed, but I can't remember what it is
 Sneffy: AntiSquid; i debuged in local and it gives the expected result ..
 icecream17: I did a game against myself, bewildering, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443871245">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443871245</a>
 izik1: Did you win?
 icecream17: Yes, but sometimes I lose
 AntiSquid: lol
 icecream17: Strangely, I never tie
 Sneffy: if someone is available to review some of my code it would be nice, i'm a bit lost now
 icecream17: Explain your code in the chat
 icecream17: the important parts
 Sneffy: okey,so i first search a good move for my first pod, using dummies for my 2nd pod and the opp podsthen after like 30-40ms is start searching a move for my 2nd  pod using my best move for pod 1 and dummies for opp pods
 Sneffy: i start *
 Sneffy: but the thing is that i have a bug that happens sometimes and i can't find it even with debug so i was wondering if someone could help me, because i'm not expert in this
 struct: It seems like an hard bug to spot
 struct: Your best solution seemed wrong to me, imo its better to be like this
 struct: bestsol[2][DEPTH]
 struct: so the bestsol[0] = firstpod
 struct: and the 1 equals second
 Sneffy: i have best[DEPTH] and best2[DEPTH] i don't think it would cause the bug..
 struct: ah ok
 struct: whats inside best[DEPTH]&#160;?
 Sneffy: Move
 Sneffy: struct tha contain angle and thurst
 lNitsua: dumb question, but if overuse | will it cause errors?
 lNitsua: like two in a row, or ending with one
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 lNitsua: thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: it'll just warn you in the game summary
 struct: Sneffy how do you keep track of bestSolution score?
 Sneffy: int bestS
 struct: so you also have bestS2?
 Sneffy: no i do bestS = -999999 between the 2 search
 Sneffy: because i don't need to keep it
 struct: So you dont  search the both pods simultaneously?
 Sneffy: no
 struct: you should, but this should not cause the bug anyways
 Sneffy: i just want to have a simple search that work before going deeper
 struct: yes
 struct: you still did not add shield right?
 Sneffy: yup
 Sneffy: only {0,100} thurst
 Sneffy: and [-18,-9,0,9,18} angles
 struct: -18,0,18 is enough btw
 struct: but back to the bug
 struct: What does your eval looks like?
 struct: Did you read magu s blog?
 Sneffy: checked*X-dist(nextcp)
 Sneffy: i had long time ago
 struct: MadKnight you here?
 struct: Trying to see if CSB guy is here
 Counterbalance: try  -dist(curpos, nextcp)/dist(prevcp, nextcp) so that it's always between 0 and 1
 Counterbalance: if you have a long dist between 2 checkpoints it might make the score negative if X or checked are too low
 Zenoscave: Fix it
 Zenoscave: there MK'ed it for you
 Sneffy: chcked is way bigger than max dist
 Sneffy: Coutnerbalance
 Sneffy: Counterbalance *
 Counterbalance: checked is nr of checkpoints passed?
 Sneffy: y
 Sneffy: the track of my score is good
 Sneffy: when my pod is running away from the race
 Sneffy: my search is telling me my score is decreeasing
 Sneffy: i just don't know why it can't find a solution that goes in the right direction
 struct: whats your depth again?
 Sneffy: 5
 Counterbalance: what's X? larger than the largest distance betwen 2 checkpoints?
 Sneffy: yes 50k
 icecream17: How should I track the possible positions I could be in, in the point of view of the opponent
 BenjaminUrquhart: dump your output into another tracker object
 BenjaminUrquhart: for me
 BenjaminUrquhart: private Tracker tracker, selfTracker;
 icecream17: 1 possible position -&gt; silence -&gt; 15 possible positions???
 Counterbalance: 1 + 4*4 =...
 icecream17: oh yeah, it's working correctly....
 IlyasElBani: when does my rank get updated&#160;?
 IlyasElBani: do clashofcode update rankings&#160;?
 icecream17: Press "submit"
 IlyasElBani: My rank is not changing even after doing 10 clash of code
 Counterbalance: it's updated nightly
 IlyasElBani: ok! thanks
 IlyasElBani: I thought it was live
 Astrobytes: Level (XP) updates live, rank (CP) updates nightly
 Counterbalance: ahh what a sneaky strategy.. i have an indirect hit, (dist 1), so the opponent bombs themselves too, losing 2 lives, making my bot think it was a direct hit
 MSmits: you can make yourself invulnerable to that easily
 MSmits: just add all damage sources to a single damage map and all cells that add up to +2 are potential locations
 icecream17: Genius idea
 Counterbalance: Yeah good idea.. however I also need to take this into account for 1 dmg and 2 torpedoes, by doing union of both torpedo blast ranges
 MSmits: my idea takes care of that as well
 MSmits: start creating your damage map when your orders are finished, then add the opponent damage to the map when you process his orders
 icecream17: Should I keep looking for the mine bug or implement that?
 MSmits: which mine bug?
 icecream17: Also, what if you torpedo, then the opponent hits itself and then moves?
 MSmits: my damagemap moves with the opponent
 MSmits: I shift it
 MSmits: thats the hard part
 Counterbalance: My bits won't count beyond 1&#160;;)
 MSmits: ah yes, that is annoying. I wrote a specific 64 bit map for it
 MSmits: 15 damage max on a cell that way
 icecream17: wow. also, the mine bug is where I put a mine at (x y), but the mines array gets updated with (other x, other y)
 MSmits: i'm not even using mines yet :P
 MSmits: just tracking the opponent ones
 ZarthaxX: MSmits code lines?
 MSmits: 1186
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 ZarthaxX: how is yours so tiny
 MSmits: not much actual logic
 ZarthaxX: i have close to 2k and sucks
 JBM: i'm at 395
 MSmits: my bot is this:
 ZarthaxX: your tracker length is short?
 JBM: i need multiple file support!
 MSmits: 1) track enemy
 ZarthaxX: JBM wtf
 icecream17: "how is yours so tiny"!? i'm at 1008!
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 MSmits: 2) shoot when i can hit something
 MSmits: 3) silence otherwise
 JBM: yeah, well sorry
 JBM: i streamed, so i had to put comments
 ZarthaxX: i see MSmits
 darkhorse64: You forgot to mention 4) choose move
 MSmits: ow right
 MSmits: I also still silence in place
 MSmits: because obviously, if the opponent doesnt know you do it, it's pretty efficient
 MSmits: takes up no extra cells
 Counterbalance: no search yet?
 MSmits: what search
 MSmits: what am I supposed to search?
 darkhorse64: MCTS&#160;? :grinning:
 Counterbalance: solutions
 icecream17: idk
 MSmits: to?
 Counterbalance: the problem
 JBM: TBF my end-of-stream version is 333
 MSmits: which problem?
 icecream17: "solutions"? you mean logic or something?
 Counterbalance: the problem is to write a perfect bot
 icecream17: It must be an awesome idea because Counterbalance isn't saying anything
 Counterbalance: the solution is a bot that never loses
 JBM: d'uh
 Counterbalance: yeah that's what I thought too, not sure why I had to explain
 MSmits: yeah sure... but it took me a lot of time to come up with this tracking code. Did not have much time for other stuff yet. Also took a  break
 MSmits: today I recorded a YT video
 MSmits: took me half a day
 JBM: oh
 JBM: do tell us about it
 JBM: URI plz
 MSmits: sure, if you can understand Dutch, by all means
 JBM: not too far removed from german is it?
 JBM: it's like a mix btw german+english, with a nasal accent
 JBM: i can deal with that
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/mtyriZcNBVw">https://youtu.be/mtyriZcNBVw</a>
 JBM: \o/
 MSmits: it's about modelling a virus epidemic
 JBM: appropriate
 Astrobytes: yesh shmooo schmnnn stroopwafel
 MSmits: lol
 Counterbalance: MSmits I didn't mean it that way - just curious about the state of your bot and what it takes to get to the rank your bot is at.. Still muddling away in bronze
 JBM: 7:15
 MSmits: i show how to write a model to show how to "flatten the curve" in 7 minutes
 JBM: now how long did the total operation take?
 MSmits: Counterbalance I know it's fine&#160;:)
 MSmits: too long jbm, half a day, because my s'ss are too sharp and i had to find a tool to lower their volume and also to put the video and audio back together. So annoying
 icecream17: I figured out the bug
 JBM: love the oh-so-typical obs-style start
 icecream17: So now I get to play against.....
 icecream17: obs?
 MSmits: jbm yes, i didnt cut anything off
 JBM: yup
 JBM: wouldn't have known 2 years ago
 MSmits: this video is basically just for my dynamic computer modelling class. Just 21 students, but I tend to just make YT videos public
 Scarfield: you can get youtube to auto generate subtitles, and translate them, its of course not perfect, but good enough to understand what is being said&#160;:)
 JBM: is that coach7 thingy epidemilogy-specific?
 MSmits: not at all
 MSmits: you can use it for anything jbm
 JBM: never heard of it&#160;:$
 darkhorse64: Counterbalance: you need to track your opponent. It's quite difficult. I am debugging my second version
 MSmits: it's educational software
 Astrobytes: That's actually pretty cool
 JBM: aaah ok
 MSmits: coach can also be used for video measurements and lab experiments
 Astrobytes: Might be useful for demonstrations when we have kids (or adults) along at some of the learning sessions at the centre
 Astrobytes: (the wildlife/conservation centre  I work at)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cma-science.nl/homepage">https://cma-science.nl/homepage</a>
 MSmits: I think they sell all over the world
 MSmits: but it's a dutch company
 Astrobytes: Cool!
 Counterbalance: interesting video MSmits, nicely done
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: i know smits voice now
 ZarthaxX: :O
 MSmits: haha ZarthaxX, my Dutch voice
 Astrobytes: (to reduce the sibilance in your recording)
 MSmits: i used the first thing i could find adobe audition
 MSmits: and selected deesser effect
 Astrobytes: It has de-essing plugins yes
 MSmits: it removed the worst of it
 MSmits: but you can still hear it in some places
 MSmits: I messed around with it
 MSmits: couldnt get all of it gone. Not sure if it is my mic or what
 Astrobytes: Just wondering. Yeah you'll never get perfect results without mic'ing up pro and sometimes even manually riding the volume on the sibilants
 Astrobytes: It's an art
 MSmits: ahh ok, so it's a difficult problem
 MSmits: I did not make many videos and when i did, it wasnt usually with voice
 Astrobytes: It's a general problem with recording vocals
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: You can do it all manually with EQ and volume automation but de-essers take some of the load off
 MSmits: EQ?
 MSmits: I suspect you dont mean Everquest
 Astrobytes: Sorry, frequency equalizer
 MSmits: ah ok
 JBM: Astrobytes: you seem to know about this, what's a layman dscription of the essing problem?
 Astrobytes: Reducing the excessive "hiss" associated with vocals containing "ess" or "ss" 
 JBM: difference between ess and ss?
 Astrobytes: socks and ceiling
 JBM: i've heard about the problem more than i've noticed it, so i'm kind of curious
 JBM: errr
 JBM: which is which
 Astrobytes: same thing
 JBM: then again, i reord a lot, but seldom [close] vocals
 MSmits: when you say socks you open your mouth and draw in air when you say the s
 Astrobytes: just pointing it out, because sometimes people just get the 's' part
 MSmits: when you say ceiling you dont
 JBM: not sure i get any of the last 10 lines
 MSmits: linessssss
 JBM: there are 2 s's in socks
 MSmits: the first s
 MSmits: i mean
 JBM: k
 Astrobytes: both s's i nsocks will be an issue
 Counterbalance: it's essentially loud white noise, right?
 JBM: yeah so it's s the problem
 Astrobytes: especially if your de-esser is set wrong (or compression)
 JBM: i kinda never de-ess
 Astrobytes: Yes, essentially counterbalance
 JBM: well on instruments who cares
 JBM: but i do choirs every now and then
 MSmits: jbm it might depend on your way of speaking
 Astrobytes: You don't need to on instruments, you're gonna EQ and compress that stuff in whatever way anyway
 JBM: yeah so back to it, the problem is that? it records too high wrt other phonemes?
 JBM: i don't recall ever EQing
 JBM: compressing yeah
 JBM: comping, yeah
 JBM: but the rest... let's call it a souvenir from the *live*
 JBM: so why is it a problem?
 JBM: from my pseudo-innocent point f view
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's like counterbalance said, a white noise rush
 JBM: if it's loud in the input, it should be loud in the output
 JBM: if it's part of speech, why remove it?
 Astrobytes: No, it's excessive high freq
 JBM: who defines it as "Excessive"?
 Astrobytes: Your ears when it goes SSSSSS
 icecream17: I won against default
 JBM: recording tends to cop at 20k anyway, right?
 JBM: *crop
 Astrobytes: Depends
 JBM: (yes, but you don't want to go into that?)
 JBM: wrt essing
 MSmits: my s-es were extreme, it was like someone doing a high pitched whistle
 Astrobytes: You can record above that, whether you hear it or not is another story. You should usually filter that out
 JBM: lest you get LF aliasing
 MSmits: anything above 3k will already sound very high pitched
 JBM: i know my theory
 JBM: but i mean
 JBM: essing was a thing before we even started to record above 44k
 Astrobytes: You must also be aware of the plosive pop problem with vocal recording right?
 JBM: that's why i said let's not go into that
 JBM: plosives yeah
 MSmits: plosive plop?
 JBM: got a filter on my mic
 JBM: well the ones two streams ago anyway
 JBM: but the pop makes sense to me
 Astrobytes: That will also reduce sibilance to a degree
 JBM: essing not so much
 Counterbalance: Sally sells seashells by the seashore
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: Sassy Sally
 JBM: how about sissi?
 Astrobytes: Same. Some people will record this and it'll be fine, give them a different mic it might be a different story.
 Counterbalance: There was a comedy show with a guy whistling the 'S' in Susan all the time, for the name, but it was funny
 Astrobytes: Some people given a good mic, will also still record the same violent sounding sibilance
 JBM: oh dear
 JBM: i was on the sibilant pages
 Counterbalance: btw can you reach silver if you only use torpedo?
 MSmits: I did
 Counterbalance: k
 Astrobytes: I got silver without
 JBM: and got to producing a dual [translating time]
 MSmits: Counterbalance even worse, I torpedoed every cell I could find where  a possible opponent was
 MSmits: even if there were 100 such cells
 JBM: dear me wp isn't shaped the same on both sides i wont make it
 JBM: a dual ss + sh sound
 Counterbalance: I keep quiet until there's only 25 or less possible locations
 Astrobytes: Yeah the translation might be off. But all you need to know is "hiss"
 JBM: yeah i'll try to look for it in my next recordings
 Astrobytes: iirc yo udon't have an issue in your streams
 Astrobytes: *you
 JBM: different mic on the last 2 or 3
 JBM: (cheaper one)
 JBM: (easier setup /o\ )
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: well i've had a pretty bad time with the very first on OOC
 JBM: like a very ugly time
 JBM: for different reasons than audio
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, the fail-stream
 JBM: but that one had top-notch audio ^^'
 Astrobytes: Haha, you can't have it al lright
 Astrobytes: *all right
 JBM: computers hate me
 Astrobytes: Do you have a studio for your music stuff JBM?
 JBM: what do you call a studio
 JBM: you mean glass-walled audio-proofed recording chambers&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No no, just a home setup
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: gotta studio mic, stand, pop, AI (err, audio itf, acronym collision around here) and MIDI kbd
 Astrobytes: I'm not doing much in the past 2 years but here's what I used to have all set up
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/sotOdqV">https://imgur.com/a/sotOdqV</a>
 JBM: wouldn't have the use for most of it, but still makes my eyes water ^^
 elderlybeginner: contest - is there a way to recognize if the opponent was hit by my torpedo or by his own?
 Astrobytes: All packed up in spare room at the minute sadly JBM
 MSmits: no, record the damage done to the cells that were hit
 MSmits: if the opponent life lost doesnt match to these cells, then he's not there
 MSmits: be sure to incorporate movement correctly
 MSmits: the sub might move between damage sources
 JBM: you'ee get back to it Astrobytes
 JBM: err
 JBM: 'll
 JBM: what a weird typo
 Astrobytes: hehe French keyboard
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i want you to know you are the only person that breaks my tracker
 JBM: if only
 elderlybeginner: that's a bit of checking to connect damage with exact opponent position
 JBM: but nope, this is work-rig qwerty
 Astrobytes: Awesome ZarthaxX, I aim to please!
 ZarthaxX: hate u :P
 Astrobytes: And yeah I will JBM.  I've only got my stringed instruments on the go right now and haven't even played much this year.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/otDJV9O">https://imgur.com/a/otDJV9O</a>
 JBM: too much CG
 Astrobytes: Nah, lots of life stuff. Stifling the music side of me a bit. I'll be back on it soon enough.
 MSmits: so many guitars
 MSmits: and guitar-like things
 MSmits: serious stuff
 Astrobytes: lol, 2 guitars, a bass guitar, a 5-string banjo and a mandolin in the case
 MSmits: thats what I said :P
 MSmits: it's impressive
 MSmits: I've never learned an instrument
 JBM: you can speak dutch
 JBM: talk about an instrument
 Astrobytes: hahaha! Only do it if you want to.Or learn Swedish
 MSmits: you might like this guy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhojoT1o1M4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhojoT1o1M4</a>

 Astrobytes: MSmits Hahaha this guy's got it down! 
 MSmits: yeah, very famous guitar player
 MSmits: my parents listened to him a lot when I was young
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX yeah, my bass skills are not great tho
 Astrobytes: Totally didn't know this guy MSmits, thanks
 MSmits: np, hf. Going to bed

 Astrobytes: I have diverse interests. Never bored if you're always into something right? :D
 ZarthaxX: correct

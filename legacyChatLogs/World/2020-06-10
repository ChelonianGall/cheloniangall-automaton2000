 sHlOk: Hi everyone
 sHlOk: Did u all notice some odd named coders on this site?
 sHlOk: they are vietnamese.
 jacek: oO
 GPseudo: Do you mean some bots participating in coding practice?
 NgonTran: á đù
 NgonTran: fu
 NgonTran: india
 WINWINWIN: Sorry? NgonTran?
 AlanSpacer: Racism Comes In Many Forms
 AlanSpacer: I am one of them
 bobby2: lol
 hill123455: anyone got any suggestion with Forest Fire fuzzle. I'm kinda stuck&#160;:|
 DonLarry: hello world
 jrke: hey
 WINWINWIN: Can someone tell me what pragmas are used to optimize C++?
 Uljahn: #pragma GCC optimize "unroll-loops,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 darkhorse64: #pragma GCC optimize("O3,inline,omit-frame-pointer,unroll-loops","unsafe-math-optimizations","no-trapping-math")
 darkhorse64: you ant speed&#160;? Take risks
 darkhorse64: *want*
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Uljahn: speed/safety trade-off
 WINWINWIN: I ont have any math anyway its PR2
 WINWINWIN: *dont
 darkhorse64: When I start a bot, I copy lots of boilerplate without thinking of it
 WINWINWIN: Would be useful but my base classes change a lot when I study other PMs
 darkhorse64: Timer, random, position, cell, bfs, ... 
 darkhorse64: grid, serialization
 darkhorse64: skeleton
 darkhorse64: 800 lines approx to start with
 WINWINWIN: I used to copy the point class, but stopped that too when I started to overload the operators
 linlinmq: funny
 darkhorse64: then, it's time to think and maybe remove some
 darkhorse64: overloading operators is really handy for all vector operations
 WINWINWIN: siman, you are destroying my rank :rage:
 Astrobytes: derjack, jacek, good work&#160;:+1:
 WINWINWIN: derjack is an alt?
 derjack: meow
 Astrobytes: Had to abandon it last night cause of the damn leaderboard
 MSmits: oware is so screwy
 MSmits:             Recurse    GW=2,78%     [ W=0,00%    L=94,44%   D=5,56%   ] [18]
 MSmits: so 3% winrate vs Re curse, 80% vs Robo
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: Robo is nr 1 :P
 MSmits: it's only 20 games each i know, but this is typical
 MSmits: I change the parameter by 1% and they're both 50%
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I feel the pain. The struggle is real.
 MSmits: this is not even an eval feature, just the sigmoid parameter
 MSmits: it happens with the exploration parameter too
 MSmits: anything i tweak
 Astrobytes: Yep, I've played with them too
 Astrobytes: And you submit, thinking "right, this beats x y and z, should be worthwhile" -&gt; Lose versus the others
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: thats why i always have 4 opponents to check against
 MSmits: I dont trust it otherwise
 Astrobytes: w, x, y and z then&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Fking crazy game
 MSmits: I just do the top 3 and agade, the reason I add him is because his bot is weird and sometimes gets really strong vs mine, with some parameters
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I noticed that about Agad e's NN. Some submits you literally steamroller it, other times you can't beat it for love nor money. Strange one. You can observe the fluctuation in his placement depending on submits
 MSmits: probably the trainingset he uses is too narrow
 MSmits: really good vs some strategies
 MSmits: useless vs others
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that sounds probable
 MSmits: my leaderboard version is weak vs re curse btw
 MSmits: I remember i never countered his last submit
 MSmits: only have a 90% winrate
 Astrobytes: *only* :P
 MSmits: sorry 10%
 MSmits: so what happens is, i submit, I push re curse, then over time other people push me over re curse
 Astrobytes: That's more like it
 MSmits: I think he trained a couple versions of NN's and picked one that did well against me
 Astrobytes: lol, the Smits Exterminator version
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits</a>
 MSmits: you can see it pretty clearly here
 Astrobytes: Yep
 WINWINWIN: reCurse uses an NN on Oware?
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: and robo and agade also
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: And I think both Tiramo n and Csipcsiri p working on them too
 MSmits: I think they have the same issue we have though
 MSmits: doesnt matter if you train the nn or fit the parameters
 MSmits: there's gonna be strong RPS
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: There doesn't seem to be a 'catch all' set of weights
 MSmits: That's usually the case, but most games have enough randomness that it doesn't lead to a lot of RPS
 MSmits: I think this game is very narrow as to what a good line of play is and the one who deviates from it first loses
 MSmits: unless someone deviates from it more, after that ofc
 MSmits: I wonder how many different games I will see with top players
 MSmits: maybe they play only  a small set of games
 derjack: time to retire this alt from oware
 MSmits: jacek?
 derjack: who
 MSmits: derjack = jacek isnt it?
 MSmits: i read that yesterday I thought
 Astrobytes: yeah
 derjack: must be a dream
 WINWINWIN: :D
 MSmits: I have done CG benches in some games with both derjack and jacek in it :P
 MSmits: I think onitama
 Astrobytes: derjack was MCTS, jacek was alphabeta
 Astrobytes: here at least
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: is alpha beta good on oware?
 Astrobytes: tric trac still has it, not sure on royale, it works up to a point yeah
 MSmits: well trictrac is in the ballpark with every non-NN except me, so it might work just as good as mcts except I got better parameters for eval...
 derjack: well i have it on onitama
 eulerscheZahl: derjack is not a new user?
 Astrobytes: No
 Astrobytes: Yeah MSmits, he has endgame database on Oware
 eulerscheZahl: stop confusing me&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: well, endgame book
 MSmits: it seems useful for oware, but you have to be careful on long games
 MSmits: the turn-limit might ruin you
 MSmits: if you sacrifice 2 seeds to get 3 and the 3 are expected at turn 203...
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but I guess you'd factor that in so you wouldn't make that error
 MSmits: thats why sometimes loops are broken near the end of the game
 MSmits: sometimes it is best to stay in the loop throughout the game, but then when the end turn nears, your bot sees a way to get a seed without time for the opponent the counter
 MSmits: to counter
 Astrobytes: yeah, that' s definitely something you see a lot
 MSmits: thats also why a good solver helps
 MSmits: if you solver sooner, your bot can see this before the opponent
 struct: hello
 MSmits: hello
 Astrobytes: o/
 derjack: i see 100us time and still im 36
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: jacek, your alt is confusing us
 derjack: set*
 MSmits: but why do you think your age will change when you set a different time :confused:
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: that's how you could keep demos playable long ago
 MSmits: hm ok
 Astrobytes: yep
 Astrobytes: That or a hex editor ofc :P
 derjack: welp is parameter fest
 derjack: better eval (for mm) works worse in mcts
 derjack: maybe its overfitted or too granual or something
 derjack: while simpler is suitable for mcts
 MSmits: except when you take the better eval and just change one tiny thing and its suddenly better than the simple one :P
 WINWINWIN: Anyone else think that the asymmetric maps on PR2 are not a good idea?
 struct: Why not?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on how much asymmetric
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. this in nonsense <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472020844">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472020844</a>
 eulerscheZahl: (imagine one spawn a little more in the center, didn't fund such a replay that fast)
 struct: ah, i did not know that starting position was not mirrored
 WINWINWIN: There are asymmetric maps but the battles are always paired
 eulerscheZahl: it's just a 1-1 if it's too asymmetric. no information gain from that
 Astrobytes: Latest 'Easy' puzzle contribution: "The Car Engineer": Given n cars, you should output the wheels of the total of cars.
 eulerscheZahl: n*4
 Astrobytes: i.e. n * 4
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: but hard to refuse with contribution guidelines
 WINWINWIN: euler it is a classic puzzle :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, then it's easy to refuse
 eulerscheZahl: "No CoC puzzle is too easy."no such rule for regular puzzles
 Astrobytes: I've downvoted and commented, only at WIP
 eulerscheZahl: shut up and take my downvote
 struct: validators are equal to test cases
 Astrobytes: lol
 WINWINWIN: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i followed your example Astrobytes
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and the default code
 struct: I think if he hads a viewer its a nice puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: write If all of the test cases succeed, then the answer will be correct.Note: delete this two lines and don't forget to print the answer.
 struct: adds*
 jrke: just n*4
 Astrobytes: LOL I didn't spot that euler :D
 eulerscheZahl: but who would make the effort to create a viewer for such a simple puzzle?
 jrke: ya stub generator  input is stupidity
 jrke: btw my puzzle any suggestions

 eulerscheZahl: oh, the path finding one
 eulerscheZahl: i saw that
 Astrobytes: Yours is just BFS distance puzzle jrke?
 jrke: yeah
 Astrobytes: I'm a bit concerned it might be a duplicate
 Astrobytes: Could be wrong
 Astrobytes: As in too similar to an already existing puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: there are definitely some puzzles with BFS and an extra twist
 jrke: nope i don't think so cause i haven't solved any puzlle like this
 WINWINWIN: jrke there are around 100 easy puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1159f460c1b31acd2a6bd5bfb6d26c1b7d9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/1159f460c1b31acd2a6bd5bfb6d26c1b7d9</a>
 eulerscheZahl: hm, not really the same even if it looks similar at first
 jrke: oh yeah looks similar but not same
 Astrobytes: Yeah this is finding the exits

 jrke: can my puzzle be rejected
 jrke:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yep. I think you need something extra to make your puzzle more interesting. As it is, just finding the distance isn't really gonna do much for most people
 jrke: K i will add more things
 Astrobytes: Have a think about it and try and come up with something original
 jrke: can i add this if child coudn't reach mom so output false
 eulerscheZahl: :thumbs_down:
 eulerscheZahl: :thumbsdown:
 jrke: K
 jrke: i will add something else
 struct: All its needed is a viewer
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 eulerscheZahl: but true, a nice animation helps to attract players
 jrke: how to add animation i didn't created any puzzle yet its my first puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can also have a look at other community contributions with animations
 derjack: making a neat animation for othello?
 jrke: does it needs JS
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: a language that compiles to JVM (e.g. Java or Kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: )
 eulerscheZahl: up to you to decide
 jrke: lol i know c++
 Astrobytes: Clojure...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/bender---episode-4</a>a puzzle with a maze + animation. the sourcecode is on github
 eulerscheZahl: scala
 eulerscheZahl: groovy

 eulerscheZahl: does CG have Scala?
 Astrobytes: yup
 jrke: nope im just a 12years old kid just started learning python
 Astrobytes: And groovy
 jrke: not yet
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's the inspiration for your puzzle
 jrke: c++ and little bit python

 MSmits: do you see how Agade stacks up agains the top 1,2&#160;?
 jrke: so i can't add animations with c++
 MSmits: weird huh? , he is rank 11
 MSmits: 12 points below Robo
 struct: I found one with nice animations
 Astrobytes: crazy stuff
 struct: I will try to do them like it is there
 struct: I  could post the link here but it uses flash
 derjack: flash? what year is it
 MSmits: the year of flash grenades
 jrke: anyone to my ques
 derjack: MSmits also you have many draws with the teapot comparing to others
 Astrobytes: Flash, Flash, I love you, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!

 Matrix007: anyone
 Matrix007: i cant understand the power of thor

 Matrix007: its like creating google maps(#so cool)
 Matrix007: but i dont get it
 Uljahn: you need to change your current position depending on your move
 Uljahn: or just click Hints on the left
 eulerscheZahl: nice, forest fire as the puzzle of the week
 Uljahn: ye, nice graphics, very close to classical puzzles
 WINWINWIN: Forest Fire seems nice, could it be modified to optimization?
 WINWINWIN: Water used being the scoring metric
 eulerscheZahl: probably the optimal solution would be found

 eulerscheZahl: wheels? including the steering wheel? don't make it complicated
 jacek: CoC puzzle?

 struct: no easy puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: was WIP, got negative feedback
 eulerscheZahl: user removed it again it seems
 jacek: and deleted account?
 WINWINWIN: I doubt it, was a reasonably advanced account, in the top 2000
 struct: advanced?

 jacek: othello?
 MSmits: thanks struct, i like random bitboard pastebins&#160;:)
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: nice 
 MSmits: i think 8x8 will be fine
 eulerscheZahl: you just want 64 bits
 MSmits: mmh though wiki says top programs almost always end in draw
 MSmits: but i doubt we'll be close to a top program with CG limitations
 jacek: so are checkers
 MSmits: yeah checkers is less complex
 jacek: but 100 (or 50?) ms is challenging enough
 MSmits: i think so
 MSmits: so 8x8 othello should be fine
 MSmits: and eulerscheZahl, yes 64 bit is nice&#160;:)
 jacek: with 10x10 you would just cheat with 128_t
 MSmits: I can't use the native 128_t because VS won't have it
 MSmits: so I end up writing my own version of that when i need to
 jacek: so othello 10x10 it is
 MSmits: aside from it fitting less good in a bitboard
 MSmits: it's also nice to have 8x8, same board as breakthrough, chess etc.
 MSmits: and checkers
 WINWINWIN: who`s going to make othello?
 MSmits: struct is doin it
 Astrobytes: Oh hey MSmits, bit offtopic, but wanted to thank you for recommending Better Call Saul, loving it
 MSmits: great
 Astrobytes: Way better than I expected
 jacek: breaking bad spin off?
 Astrobytes: Yea
 MSmits: it's a totally different story, but the cinematics is similar to breaking bad
 MSmits: same kind of tricks they use
 eulerscheZahl: i just finished watching the current season
 MSmits: it's cool
 Astrobytes: It's a worthy successor to BB
 MSmits: prequel, but I get your point :0
 Astrobytes: Yeah lol
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes the scenes are a little lenghty IMO. and i hate reading subtitles when they speak spanish
 MSmits: ah... us Dutch are used to subtitles
 Astrobytes: Learn Spanish. ezpz
 MSmits: you Germans are used to people magically spewing out noises that dont coincide with the movement of the mouth
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 <b>**MSmits is a lipreader</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: always had arouind 50 dB hearing loss, so I can lipread
 MSmits: which makes it extremely annoying to watch dubbed stuff
 Astrobytes: Damn, yeah, I can imagine
 MSmits: it's sometimes nice when my students are doing a test 
 MSmits: "I was just asking him for a pen"
 MSmits: "mmmh nah that's not what you were saying"
 Astrobytes: LOL yeah, that's awesome
 eulerscheZahl: my father had a WWII veteran as a teacher
 eulerscheZahl: couldn't hear high frequencies anymore
 jacek: so women too
 MSmits: my father has the same hearing handicap from standing too near to cannons
 eulerscheZahl: so they spoke in a high voice during exams
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: lol, so he sacrificed his hearing so they could live in a free country and they sacrifice their dignity for a few extra points on a test&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Kids eh
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: I once walked around with hearing aids for 3 yrs that were tuned to my fathers hearing handicap
 MSmits: cuz they mixed up the files
 MSmits: I never realized cuz you know... i heard better with them than without. How are you gonna know
 Astrobytes: Man that's crap! At least you could hear I suppose
 WINWINWIN: Isnt that extremely bad for you?
 jacek:&#160;! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472122213">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472122213</a>
 jacek: oh, it was timeout
 jacek: :c
 MSmits: WINWINWIN nah, the cap for hearing damage is the same for everyone, no matter your handicap
 MSmits: so if you hear really badly, it doesnt mean you can take a greater amplification
 jrke: im out of mind now what to add in PR2 now
 MSmits: thats why hearing aids are limited for people who have a lot of loss, there's limits that make you always hear worse than other people,otherwise your hearing would be damaged more
 Astrobytes: jacek, do you tune your Oware bot to beat me on purpose? :P
 jacek: here i beat MSmits without timeout <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472122656">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/472122656</a>
 MSmits: thats a nice win
 MSmits: my bot tends to gather up a lot of seeds
 MSmits: sometimes it backfires&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It backfired there.
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: I had a version before that assumed I would never have more than 31 seeds in a pit
 Astrobytes: I remember that
 MSmits: that made me sometimes crash
 MSmits: but so rarely that it was really hard to fix
 jacek: but you timeouted now
 MSmits: sure, but I time out in every game, once in 100 games or so
 MSmits: 5 ms buffer is not enough, or I have a bug in every game&#160;:)
 struct: you go 5ms under the limit?
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: so do i
 struct: I use all 100ms in UTTT
 struct: no margin
 MSmits: my oware bot has some crazy seeding and harvesting though, I imagine there could still be a bug
 jacek: and look where you are
 struct: I never improved it :p
 jacek: how many params are in your eval, if i may ask
 MSmits: in mine?
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: allright, if i dont count exploration and the sigmoid param it:
 MSmits: hmm, hard to say
 MSmits: it's 6 + a kroo thingy i do
 MSmits: that one website said you should give points for a pit with more than 12 seeds right?
 jacek: i have 5 for the eval. + exploration and fpu
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: I do that differently using 3 parameters and an array 
 jacek: though i think it depends if it reaches opponent
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but my solution is not intuitive really. I experimented a ton and got something that works, not great but better than just &gt; 12
 MSmits: I have an array for each number you can have in a pit, also taking the pit location into account
 MSmits: and then basically have the same bonus for most of those values (3 different ones)
 MSmits: it doesnt make sense why it works because the bonus is high in places where i think it shouldn't etc.
 MSmits:  i tried to fit the bonus array to a function with less params, but it never performed better (this was my experimental version)
 jacek: hmm for me having 2 seeds in the middle it says its good
 Astrobytes: Crazy oscillating parameters and stuff lol
 MSmits: jacek stuff like that yeah, I never checked the 2 seeds in middle thing
 MSmits: I do have a 2 seed param where i give penalty for each pit with 2 seeds in it
 MSmits: same for 1 seed 
 MSmits: but its a very weak feature. Doesnt seem to affect much
 jacek: that granulatily works for minimax eval, but in mcts i dont take the location into account
 struct: Othello in 2 hours?
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: damnit struct, you are too fast
 struct: Isnt ready yet
 struct: I just miss the viewer
 struct: rest should have no bugs
 MSmits: take it easy, i am working on some other stuff too :P
 jacek: lets call tric trac
 MSmits: he'll love it
 struct: First I need to make the game WIP for a long time
 struct: so I farm upvotes
 struct: and get exp
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: 250XP for an approved multiplayer is a joke
 MSmits: the speed at which struct can write multis it's actually pretty efficient :P
 struct: yeah, then we have a flood of multies
 struct: more multies than puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: obviously there are differences between different multiplayers as well
 struct: true
 struct: Im preety sure you spent a lot of time on Vindi
 eulerscheZahl: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: porting the map generator alone was a full weekend
 struct: Did you have any code to guide?
 eulerscheZahl: (that includes different ground transitions, so just visuals)
 eulerscheZahl: there was no documentation iirc. just tic tac toe
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remember you working on the blood spatters
 Astrobytes: *splatters
 eulerscheZahl: and bloody footsteps
 Astrobytes: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: was fun
 eulerscheZahl: and then one day i couldn't create new contributions anymore
 eulerscheZahl: but update existing ones and set the state from private to pending
 eulerscheZahl: so we approved it on a friday evening and expected CG to delete it on Monday again
 eulerscheZahl: tuesday, still online
 eulerscheZahl: wednesday: info mail promoting the new game :D
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah. Ah the memories
 eulerscheZahl: i still have it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/B9rVFPq">https://imgur.com/a/B9rVFPq</a>
 struct: Nice :D
 struct: I almost forgot that SDK now has getWorld().getWidth()
 Astrobytes: haha awesome
 darkhorse64: Why not tell thibpat about your othello and make it an unofficial contest&#160;?
 darkhorse64: You'll get more traction
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't thibpat's point to promote an existing game?
 Astrobytes: No he's open to new community games too
 Astrobytes: (To make proper unofficial contests essentially)
 darkhorse64: Making board game based small contests looks like a good idea to me
 darkhorse64: At least, it 's something new on this platform
 struct: I suggested Yinsh, at the time but I think Yinsh might be a bit hard to start with
 Astrobytes: Personally I don't mind difficult contests, I mean it's a bot programming competition, so it's a challenge right? But it would limit the number of participants certainly
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/NpWnoZv.png">https://i.imgur.com/NpWnoZv.png</a>
 struct: soon
 Astrobytes: Nice
 struct: I just need to apply moves to viewer and parse inputs I think
 struct: This is if I have no bugs
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: so you have logic?
 jacek: legal moves etc
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and find 3 users willing to approve. but you are more patient than a certain fish
 jacek: even when you can get additional turn?
 struct: That is simple jacek
 struct: if (getLegal(playerID) &gt; 0)
 jacek: so its just another turn
 struct: else next turn player plays again
 eulerscheZahl: you haven't solved this one yet struct <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/othello">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/othello</a>
 struct: or should I do like yinsh and multiple omves per turn?
 jacek: nah
 jacek: they happen rarely i think
 eulerscheZahl: there are no different action types like move and remove ring, are there?
 struct: it happened when i applied actions.get(0)
 struct: no euler
 struct: just place ring
 eulerscheZahl: then call the player again
 eulerscheZahl: makes it easier for the bots
 eulerscheZahl: and give full board, not delta&#160;;)
 struct: Also I can change size easily without breaking anything&#160;:)
 struct: delta?
 eulerscheZahl: where the opponent played
 struct: Ah right
 struct: Will do
 eulerscheZahl: and get squiddy into submitting a D bot
 darkhorse64: If you ask the player to send "PASS" if he cannot play, would it make your life easier&#160;?
 struct: I don't need to do that darkhorse64
 struct: I can just not let him play at all
 struct: if i dont switch player
 darkhorse64: That means the player to move shoud issue several moves&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Make sure you indicate that the player is out of moves
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: read the chat above darkhorse64
 eulerscheZahl: just call the player again
 struct: why astro?
 jacek: yeah, why
 struct: He wont get a turn if he is  out of moves
 Astrobytes: In case someone wonders why they can't paly
 Astrobytes: *play
 eulerscheZahl: you mean UI-wise indicators?
 Astrobytes: Just in the UI show - now moves
 jacek: well that would be a thing for the viewwer
 Astrobytes: *no moves
 darkhorse64: OK. Got it. I w worried how to write the bot
 struct: ah ok
 Astrobytes: But in reference to your method here I agree it seems good
 struct: Also this time I separated viewer from game jacek
 jacek: hm?
 darkhorse64: It has been such a long time since I wrote my last MCTS ...
 Astrobytes: game logic from graphics
 struct: So that i dont have Viewer code inside the game engine
 struct: yeah that what astro said
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes, jacek: thanks for pushing me back to #4 at Oware
 AlanSpacer: If i was there
 Astrobytes: Sure we'll pull you down again soon enough, don't get too happy darkhorse64 :P
 AlanSpacer: I'd of brought you up to 100 &lt;3
 darkhorse64: I have been waiting for you for months
 AlanSpacer: Should I be jealous&#160;? ;o
 Astrobytes: I didn't play it for a long time&#160;;)
 AlanSpacer: The site thinks I'm a bot
 AlanSpacer: Won't let me play CoC *cries*
 Astrobytes: Do puzzles/multis instead
 WINWINWIN: CoC is kind of boring
 AlanSpacer: It just let me back on xD
 AlanSpacer: I'm trying to enhance C# skills
 Astrobytes: CoC is possibly the worst way to do that
 WINWINWIN: In CoC :D
 Astrobytes: Better doing puzzles
 WINWINWIN: You will get crushed in all 3 modes
 WINWINWIN: Python/Ruby dominate
 AlanSpacer: Lol, just tryiing to get use to coding with it. I'll get to Puzzles soon
 AlanSpacer: Well, got to 9000th using only C#
 Astrobytes: If I were you, I'd go to puzzles instead of continuing
 Astrobytes: Just my opinion, don't let me stop you
 struct: Should I make all pieces flip at once?
 struct: or do them in groups?
 WINWINWIN: Do it in groups? so that it is easier to see?
 Snef: struct when you say in groups you mean one by one or dir per dir
 struct: Ok ill try
 MSmits: maybe try both, milk it for the upvotes, you farmer you
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 struct: Like per chain
 struct: a chain can trigger another chain
 MSmits: ohhh, this has chains?
 Snef: right per chain shoud be way more user friendly
 struct: I call them chains
 MSmits: games with chains are cool
 AlanSpacer: The IDE support for C# is so trash
 MSmits: use a local IDE
 MSmits: I always dp
 MSmits: do
 AlanSpacer: I guess I wiill &lt;3
 MSmits: VS is awesome
 Astrobytes: Particularly for C#
 MSmits: if CG improved the IDE 100 times, you would still think it is crap because VS exists
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: having a real time debugger helps too much
 MSmits: yea
 Astrobytes: I love the VS debugger. The memory view etc.
 Astrobytes: Well, for C++
 WINWINWIN: Reversi is an 8x8 grid in normal version?
 Snef: yes
 struct: I made it so that it can work on any size
 struct: even the viewer adapts
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/xUR6MOI.png">https://i.imgur.com/xUR6MOI.png</a>
 struct: 16*!6
 Snef: you could do league like 8*8 / 10*10 / 12*12 / then dynamic size 
 Astrobytes: With invisible pieces in top league ofc
 Snef: i wasn't trolling&#160;:(
 struct: I know Snef, ill see how it goes
 struct: game is a bit complex
 Astrobytes: lol I know, we were coming up with insane variations before
 Astrobytes: We can test variable board sizes in WIP 
 Snef: game is way less complex than go
 Snef: i think&#160;?
 struct: it is
 struct: its a bit above checkers i think
 jacek: not that you could solve it in 100ms
 struct: You forget that there  wasnt D before
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 struct: Also I didn't read the rules yet
 struct: I just played and think the rules are what im doing :D
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: Awesome approach
 WINWINWIN: Which one takes priority now struct? Othello or the other one that you were working on?
 struct: othello
 jacek: hex othello
 jacek: wow, what a push Astrobytes thankies
 Astrobytes: Yeah, submitted wrong version. Enjoy it while it lasts :P
 Astrobytes: It's the ~38/39 point point barrier that needs breaking
 jacek:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: In Oware
 struct: How can my bot go from 35 to 60th in 1 day&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Where?
 struct: utttt
 Astrobytes: Who submitted?
 Snef: n dc
 struct: nd c and Q oo
 Uljahn: uttt is a hot topic on ru today
 struct: It works
 struct: Nice
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/F1XrTQX.gifv">https://i.imgur.com/F1XrTQX.gifv</a>
 struct: I might add a pause between chain flips though
 jacek: there is error in frame 12
 struct: where?
 struct: oh i see
 struct: bugs
 struct: nooooo
 jacek: the diagonal black
 struct: multiple
 struct: Yeah
 struct: This is because i dont check every piece
 struct: im dumb
 struct: thanks jacek
 jacek: well, multitude of errors then
 struct: yeah
 struct: many
 struct: I was only checking the piece I placed + the ones fliped
 struct: I think fixed
 struct: Wait how should it work though&#160;:/
 jacek: hm?
 struct: I got it semi working but need to fix some stuff
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/eCiQIGM.gifv">https://i.imgur.com/eCiQIGM.gifv</a>
 struct: is this what it should happen?
 jacek: umm
 jacek: no
 struct: So flips dont trigger other flips?
 jacek: there should be only new black and other connectable blacks
 jacek: so just 1 black in this case
 jacek: there is no 'chain flipping'
 struct: Lol
 struct: oh god
 struct: Why did I though there was 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: I even spent time animating chains :D
 struct: I guess I could adapt it so it flips each direction at a time?
 struct: or do you think its too slow jacek?
 jacek: it should flip all discs simulateuosly 
 struct: ok thanks
 struct: but in viewer too?
 jacek: otherwise some people would confuse it for chaining
 struct: ok you are right
 IXzXI: come in clash of code :D
 Astrobytes: No :D
 IXzXI: D: it's bad
 jacek: (this is not my alt)
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: chess notation or x y?
 IXzXI: yes)
 IXzXI: :D
 jacek: x y
 jacek: ah wait
 jacek: by chess notation you meant A1, B1 etc.?
 jacek: or Nf3
 struct: a1 sorry
 jacek: othello uses A1 etc. then
 Astrobytes: Yeah, top left is A1
 struct: Here was me thinking game had chains
 struct: maybe ill create ultimate othello
 Astrobytes: Just been reading back, lol
 struct: 20x20 board with chains
 Astrobytes: It's probably some other game already 
 struct: ill accept both x y and a1
 Astrobytes: Fair enough. Switchable in viewer?
 MSmits: btw, if you want a oware end game db, you can probably store at most 6 or 7 seed data bases
 struct: I could do that
 jacek: using unicode stuff?
 MSmits: there are 31824 positions with 7 seeds
 jacek: do you have endtables?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: but I calculated it
 Astrobytes: thingy does
 jacek: would there be any benefit though?
 Astrobytes: But not sure how big his are
 struct: Well some might not winnable though right?
 struct: not be*
 Astrobytes: thingy = tric trac that is
 MSmits: while rolling out your tree, you can end it sooner
 MSmits: sometimes a lot of nodes are spent on tiny numbers of seeds just going around
 jacek: and endgame table is in form [houses] -&gt; max seed score&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Solver helps with this no?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: Astrobytes it can help but sometimes it is not enough
 Astrobytes: Understood
 MSmits: btw, I am not suggesting this is an I-win button. Just that it is an option
 MSmits: and also, you need to turn it off after ply 100-150
 MSmits: or you'll screw yourself over with the turn limit
 Astrobytes: Yeah as previously mentioned, does make sense
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: and of course if you have an end game database you filled your codesize and you cant use an opening book :P
 MSmits: though it'd be interesting to see how many positions you can calculate in the first 1s and fill your end game database right then and there
 Astrobytes: Unless you train offline and get weights and use that to .... oh :P
 jacek: im tweaking my eval. quite often the score of my node is very high like 90% win chance when suddenly solver kicks in and its a lose
 MSmits: doesnt surprise me
 Astrobytes: Node pool creation + precalc + opening book in 1s?
 struct: Its possible to tie on othello right?
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: ye
 Astrobytes: ah
 MSmits: node pool creation shouldnt cost anything i think
 jacek: and game can be ended before board is filled
 MSmits: unless you assign values?
 struct: if there are no pieces right jacek?
 Astrobytes: Nah
 Astrobytes: @MSmits
 jacek: when both players can't move
 struct: Yeah or that
 Astrobytes: Made that mistake before
 struct: if one player doesnt have pieces the other cant move
 MSmits: right now I am just doing like 1 million rollouts in the first 1s, but it's gonna always do the same move anyway, pretty pointless use of calc time
 jacek: let me guess, 5
 MSmits: thats the only one thats not solved as a loss in awari
 Astrobytes: Yeah I get between 800K and 1.1M on first turn, pretty much always 5 lol
 MSmits: if you're interested in how they solved awari: read this:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.57.7918&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.57.7918&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
 MSmits: it basically tells you how to generate an endgame database also, if you read between the lines
 Astrobytes: "We computed the databases on a cluster with 72 dualprocessor machines, built by IBM. Each machine containstwo 1.00 GHz Pentium III processors, 1 GB main memory,and a 20 GB IDE disk"
 MSmits: basically, their entire solving method is an endgame database
 MSmits: just fyi, you cant do this on oware abapa due to loops
 MSmits: but you can do some similar things I guess
 Astrobytes: Yep. Extra work required.
 struct: Shame I doint have 72 machines
 jacek: We expect that checkers will bethe first game solved, possibly within the current decade.
 MSmits: I'm pretty sure you can repeat this exercise on cloud computing for maybe a monthly salary&#160;:)
 jacek: e. Othello willbe harder to solve, and chess will definitely not be solved inthe foreseeable future
 struct: jacek isnt it solved though?
 MSmits: it's an old paper
 MSmits: yes its solved
 MSmits: weakly
 MSmits: which is the only interesting way to solve imho
 jacek: paper is from 2001(?) and checkers were solved in 2008(?)
 struct: Did not know you were quoting the paper
 Astrobytes: Yeah, fix your references jacek
 MSmits: oware is a LOT less complex than checkers
 MSmits: it's like 10^12 positions
 MSmits: some of you guys may have a HD-size that has enough room for all of them
 Astrobytes: And people have worked on mancala games with computers for decades
 MSmits: checkers is like 10^20 or so?
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: othello double that or something
 MSmits: double in power
 MSmits: uttt is probably similar to checkers in complexity
 MSmits: between checkers and othello
 Astrobytes: "double in power" - order of magnitude?
 MSmits: yes that
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 struct: meanwhile yinsh has 8*10^13 starting positions
 jacek: uttt with cg rules is probably a bit harder
 jacek: though favors 1st player
 MSmits: nope, I have calculated an upper limit of 10^35 positions, but this includes many unreachable ones
 MSmits: realistically probably 10^30
 jacek: i mean without cg rules you can see earlier the game will end with draw
 MSmits: you mean without the "count won boards"  rule?
 MSmits: there are several variations
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: yes, that one seems to almost always draw
 MSmits: it's not that hard to block the opponent from getting 3 in a row
 Astrobytes: Right, time for Better Call Saul, been an educational day as always
 Astrobytes: gn all
 MSmits: have fun watching, gn!
 struct: gn
 jacek: heres something about awari and opening book via alpha-beta <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/146939/eth-25905-02.pdf">https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/146939/eth-25905-02.pdf</a>
 MSmits: thats cool thanks
 MSmits: kar liso's p1 uttt play is sometimes unbeatable I think
 MSmits: it sometimes makes a mistake I can counter as p2, but often, no matter what I do, it solves to a loss vs him
 MSmits: but there may be some weird narrow line of play I missed with meta mcts
 struct: Now the real problem
 struct: x y or y x?
 darkhorse64: row, colum
 darkhorse64: *column*
 struct: thanks
 struct: Time!
 MSmits: Space!
 JBM: Thriftiness!
 struct: Time to submit it
 struct: Illedan!!!
 Snef: struct do you need cg to approve it or it'll be available now&#160;?
 struct: I will be avaible in contributions once i make it public
 DragonJ: this is sad, fantastic bits is a pain, the state system isn't working
 struct: What do you mean?
 DragonJ: I get the grabbed state after my wizard drops it
 DragonJ: so the game considers it dropped and I cant throw it
 DragonJ: will try using the snaffle state to try and go around the issue

 struct: Shoud work
 JBM: why do the pieces become longer than a cell when they rotate?
 struct: I use a bad method to rotate
 JBM: to quote a famous fellow
 JBM: FIX IT ^^
 struct: easy fix, make circles smaller 
 JBM: that would fix "bigger than cell", but not "bigger than flat circle diameter", no?
 struct: I havent tried, I have the same problem in Yinsh
 struct: Can't forget to write French statement
 JBM: mmm
 JBM: let me remember to take a closer look sometime
 JBM: i'm becoming way more proficient than i anticipated with their entity system
 struct: Once you get used to it its pretty easy
 DragonJ: ok its not an int or a float or a string so how do I make it a number
 JBM: I've been wanting to get rid of it since the start
 JBM: But I'll probably try and complete tvc first
 DragonJ: ok it is a string but is not a string... I am confused
 GaryAflalo: at what time ranking is update&#160;?
 DragonJ: also it says I am using python but I cant strip a string...
 Snef: struct you still there&#160;?

 Snef: in both position&#160;?
 struct: ah right
 struct: I forgot
 Snef: :p
 hxppx: hey guys, i have been coding in python for the last 2 months but now I feel like I am stuck and I cant get better, any advice&#160;?
 Snef: do puzzle
 Snef: then try multis
 struct: or pick a project and try doing it
 Hankdane: It's not unusual for any skill learning to hit plateaus.
 Snef: i'd find hard to define being stuck tho
 hxppx: well I guess a language as python cant be mastered in 2 months 
 Snef: if you are doing a project you struggle with you'll search and improve so..
 Nieminen: Project Euler is a great way to make sure you're challenged. Being challenged is the only way to grow&#160;:)
 Snef: struct fix your seed :p
 hxppx: right I should take a deeper look into project Euler then, thanks&#160;!
 Nieminen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projecteuler.net/">https://projecteuler.net/</a>

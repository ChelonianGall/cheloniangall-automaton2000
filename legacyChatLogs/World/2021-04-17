 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Anybody had any luck with genetic algorithms in python for CSB or search race?
 MadKnight: NotSureWhyThisWorks how exactly are u gonna use genetic algo for it&#160;?

 Marchete: happy caturday
 jacek: happy Caturday
 MadKnight: NotSureWhyThisWorks it's all actually a lot easier
 MadKnight: NotSureWhyThisWorks u can just generate 10 000 random 6 depth movements and pick the best one 
 Mandelbort: n**n
 Mandelbort: sdfadfad
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: MadKnight have you implemented that with python and has success? I am fairly new to this and not sure how possible it is to try lots of combinations in a short time (&lt;50ms) with python in particular
 MadKnight: NotSureWhyThisWorks u would have barely enough sims to randomize a somewhat straight movement
 MadKnight: well for just 1 pod it would be better
 Marchete: with python you can't
 MadKnight: no u actually can
 MadKnight: my bot worked nice with 600 sims
 Marchete: "how possible it is to try lots of combinations in a short time (&lt;50ms) with python in particular"
 Marchete: pretty much impossible
 Marchete: unless 600 sims is "lots of combinations"
 MadKnight: u just need to separate pod simulation
 MadKnight: and they will manage to somewhat move the right direction
 MadKnight: somewhat
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: so ~600 sims of completely random 6 depth movements worked well?
 MadKnight: well not completely...
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: the real question is did it beat the gold boss?
 MadKnight: actually if u get at least 1k then it's good

 jacek: opening book eh
 Marchete: eeeh
 Marchete: I think that your jacekmax is somehow an alphazero, you just replace the policy part for a reuse of the value one, via children
 Marchete: the good thing is that the NN is smaller and simpler to train
 Marchete: the bad thing is that if the game simulation is costly
 Marchete: you need many sims to get the policy part (you need to simulate all children and get the NN value)
 jacek: yes
 jacek: my training 'framework' mostly looks like a0 one, except theres no policy
 Marchete: and the MCTS should behave similarly
 Marchete: I still don't know what "value" to send to train it
 Marchete: I have 2 random NN weights
 Marchete: so I have gamestate + value
 Marchete: but what to send to the training part?
 Marchete: go to endgame and backtrack -1.0 and 1.0 for winner and loser?
 jacek: im using the value for root of the search
 Marchete: I mean replace all gamestate values for -1.0 or 1.0?
 Marchete: but the value from random weights are just sh*t
 Marchete: no?
 jacek: at first yes. but at very least they would be good near endgames
 jacek: after a while a true values from endgames would be propagated earlier and earlier
 Marchete: maybe I'd try a mixed approach
 jacek: that was my issue with temporal difference learning, when you update every step. at first it seems it would adjust to random weights. but eventually it will get into more true values
 Marchete: k*win/loss + (1-k)*root value
 jacek: could be, that what connect4 folks did at first
 Marchete: I think that could take care of short and long term
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628">https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-4-improving-the-training-target-6efba2e71628</a>
 Marchete: to be honest
 Marchete: I trust CG people more than those papers
 Marchete: most papers are either NN with thousand of nodes
 Marchete: or python code with questionable performance
 Marchete: right now my jacekmax code fails at exploring
 yyzl: Hi,I am chinese
 Marchete: sometimes it just go for a node and doesn't explore any other
 Marchete: I need that at least the depth 1 moves are expanded and tested
 jacek: oh, i didnt mention in UCT im using random [0.9,1.1] * value
 Marchete: random?
 Marchete: why?
 jacek: randomly multiply by 0.9-1.1
 jacek: so it wont be deterministic, and for training the bounds could be bigger
 Marchete: ok
 jacek: and apparently its good against bookers
 Marchete:&#160;:)
 Marchete: I'll try to fix my FPU and then I'll check how to train
 Marchete: at least it can beat a random bot

 Ordonnateur: For this puzzle you have to gather all possible stack possible then choose the lowest size one or there is a trick with some instant function doing the job for me (because being easy with having some timeout managment doesn't seems normal for me xd)&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/container-terminal">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/container-terminal</a>I'm trying to do it in C++ (yeah that's not the best idea xd) but either I'm blind, either it's "easy" only on specific language ^^'.

 geppoz: Ordonnateur what do you mean?
 geppoz: the string is short, max 500 char
 geppoz: so even a simple search for each char should be enough
 geppoz: for that dimensions an O(n²) is viable
 Ordonnateur: yes 500 char but you have a lot of combination with just doing all possible case
 Armia_Evil: :lollipop::candy::lollipop::candy:Ordon
 geppoz: scan the next input char, then search if you can put it in an existing position or if you need to add another
 geppoz: (that is my tought looking at the statement, I didn't solved yet)
 Ordonnateur: This only don't work on every case
 geppoz: ok, trying, let you know
 Ordonnateur: because nothing say what is the "best" to keep before ending the sort (look at the cba spam for ex)

 geppoz: I suppose you are thinking too far...&#160;;)

 Yash27: hey in private clashes there's only 1 question per clash right? is there any way we can increase num of ques per game?
 Uljahn: Yash27: no

 Ordonnateur: How can you know if it's better to put c on b or to do 2 column when you check only the current char&#160;? (with cbacba and cba the best choice is different so you have to check the whole thing no&#160;?)
 Uljahn: no
 geppoz: put it on the stack where the top is greater, but minimum
 geppoz: if there is not, then put in another stack
 geppoz: *greater or equal

 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on what u wanna do
 PatrickMcGinnisII: If you just wanna jump into CG, python probably has the smallest learning curve to start.  for speed use one of the C langs, , for apps etc. java maybe with a little kotlin thrown in, for web there is a variety.  so there u go.

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Big Pharm saying people need booster shots
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: news is bad for my brain
 Astrobytes: Hm. Haven't seen that here yet
 Astrobytes: With the new strains it kinda figures, but they need a new vax for those. Greedy shites.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all about the $
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Always.
 Astrobytes: I mean don't believe the conspiracies, if they had cures for things etc we'd all be robbing banks to get them :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Need a landfill for the 200M needles
 Astrobytes: They're incinerated.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh,ok
 Astrobytes: Also a problem, but less so than landfills full of hypodermic needles :D

 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm dragging my feet on night of war

 Astrobytes: MSmits: :clap:
 jacek:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I got a alpha beta setup, but I'm worried higher leagues are gonna screw it up
 Astrobytes: You really don't need ab for the first leagues. They are totally pointless leagues.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did yall straight minmax?
 Astrobytes: I think I hardcoded until top league.
 jacek: minimax now, heuristics in lower leagues
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm thinking about changing the eval to include a null move heuristic, never did that b4
 Astrobytes: jeez dude
 jacek: theres WAIT move
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh yea, i usually ignore those cause they make the tree too big...but at final action depth it should give better results
 Astrobytes: You don't need a search and *definitely* don't need to start messing around with the null move heuristic.
 Astrobytes: Just play to win. The bosses are ridiculously easy.
 jacek: i mean null move heuristic would be pointless here if its legal action
 Astrobytes: ^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: brain fog, i'll make sure my minmax works
 Astrobytes: I'm not convinced it's a good game tbh
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: I mean it works, and he did a good job etc.I just don't really feel it.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: reminds me of the game whre you have to shoot around obstacles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, cultist wars
 Astrobytes: Kinda different
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and Code of ice and fire
 Astrobytes: That had a lot more depth to it
 Astrobytes: imo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: true
 PatrickMcGinnisII: waas gonna switch to C++ for next contest, but I'm doing house remodel... took today off
 Astrobytes: Did you sort out the wrecked property?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they screwed a satellite dish to the roof
 PatrickMcGinnisII: besides them damaging every wall and door,etc. in the house
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have to put a new roof on it

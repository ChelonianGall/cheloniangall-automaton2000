 eulerscheZahl: it's enough, let's raise the quality of the chat
 mzbear: well, i started writing dots and boxes bot
 VizGhar: Hmm my EndScreenModule isn't showing even tho setScores is called in onEnd method (running locally)
 VizGhar: is it possible, that I can't see endscreen in local version of my multiplayer game?
 eulerscheZahl: did you include it in the pom and also config.js?
 eulerscheZahl: I bet that you forgot this line:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/config.js#L9">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/Onitama/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/config.js#L9</a>
 jacek: good morning
 Cappefra: does csb unlock all rules in silver rather than bronze?
 eulerscheZahl: CSB has rule changes until legend
 eulerscheZahl: including a completely new input format in gold
 jacek: :heart:
 Cappefra: woah ok
 mzbear:  hate it when the editor bugs out and starts flagging errors incorrectly
 mzbear: there seems to be some kind of race condition in the code analysis, and it doesn't recover after it has gotten out of sync
 mzbear: .. well, race condition, or any other cause of desync, but i'm willing to bet it's an async issue
 coldcodehah: is anybody there？
 jacek: hmm?
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/316e0b26-318b-4be0-aa04-0df51782716f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/316e0b26-318b-4be0-aa04-0df51782716f</a>

 VizGhar: hmm when the chat uses pastebin instead of full message?
 mzbear: i suppose it does that when there are newlines in the message
 mzbear: vizghar, you could add error messages for illegal moves
 VizGhar: I'm calling deactivate player with proper message. Maybe there is some other call to SDK I'm missing
 VizGhar: the documentation is pretty spread not even sure where to find it
 mzbear: during the first turn too?
 mzbear: i'm still testing the first turn
 VizGhar: yes
 mzbear: i set my location to -1785748208 0 0 ... and it allowed me to play the first turn just fine
 VizGhar: Hmm there is check for incorrect starting position
 mzbear: I left the first player empty, and it now uses incorrect images for players
 VizGhar: btw last parameter is index on tile 0 is topleft, 1 topRight, 2 rightTop...
 VizGhar: i'll have to take notes right away :P
 VizGhar: wow nice bug&#160;:) not even sure how to test it locally. I'll resubmit in 1-2hrs
 mzbear: you don't check starting locations correctly
 mzbear: The game has crashed. Please contact the author and enclose the following error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9199efb-6b97-49a4-a5a0-79b9cbea81f3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c9199efb-6b97-49a4-a5a0-79b9cbea81f3</a>
 VizGhar: Hmm I see. Catching only Timeout... And you are talking about first move in game loop. Now i understand
 mzbear: negative x in the starting location triggers that at least
 jacek: good enough. push it to production
 VizGhar: mzbear pls share source that bug it
 mzbear: std::cout &lt;&lt; "-5 0 0" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 mzbear: it doesn't crash immediately, it crashes after the first tile is placed afterwards
 mzbear: submitted my bot to the arena ... it just picks a random move every time.  unfortunately there's nobody to play against
 mzbear: but at least the next guy can play against my random bot now :D
 VizGhar: :D true. I can see I haven't added onle line to stub (you are supposed to pick starting position before game loop)
 VizGhar: so first cout should have 3 numbers all others 2
 VizGhar: but still can't crash it :D
 darkhorse64: mzbear: a new contrib&#160;?
 mzbear: darkhorse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59519a876ee17f2efd6a5e0813e7a8fdd0c9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59519a876ee17f2efd6a5e0813e7a8fdd0c9</a>
 darkhorse64: stil very WIP
 MSmits: interesting game though
 mzbear: are you really supposed to choose your starting location without looking at your hand first?
 VizGhar: Not in real game. Can add it later
 VizGhar: yeah its very WIP&#160;:) just learning how to work with SDK
 mzbear: you should work on making the interface stable ASAP, so people can start making bots to test the game
 mzbear: so the bot will have to see his hand before deciding the starting position
 VizGhar: hmm this is pretty straightforward addition... I'll stabilize it today
 mzbear: you could change the game loop so that you have commands "START x y index" and "PLACE tile rotation"
 mzbear: that way the pre-loop initialization goes away
 mzbear: in the gameloop, you'll be given other player's START and PLACE commands
 mzbear: the initialization phase will only tell the number of players
 MSmits: VizGhar also make sure you talk to euler. He created quite a few of these
 Yupq: guys
 darkhorse64: Yeah, it's missing the tiles and their description. It depends very much on how much burden you place on the programmer. You have to think about that
 Yupq: any girls?
 darkhorse64: only coders
 Yupq: i want to learn something
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm available for the next 3 weeks, xmas holidays&#160;:)
 MSmits: we have a teapot, which is nearly the same thing Yupq	
 Yupq: any females here?gg
 Yupq: wanna learn a lil something
 MSmits: maybe not call them females is a start
 Yupq: what should i call them?
 MSmits: women/girls is fine
 darkhorse64: He confuses bits and tits
 MSmits: ah yes, he's confused about his bits
 VizGhar: Call them just mum in your case i suppose
 Yupq:&#160;:(
 Yupq: any women/girls here?
 Yupq: I want to learn something
 VizGhar: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Yupq: /me
 <b>**Yupq slaps  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/56073084395375" /> Yupq: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: this is a tricky troll. He sounds kind of ok at first, but when you ask about what he wants to learn, :poop: really gets started
 Yupq: i want to learn coding
 MSmits: from women/girls only?
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: please pick your best hammer
 eulerscheZahl: i'm considering
 MSmits: just one sec, let him get his line in&#160;:)
 Yupq: yeah so that i can see 1300135
 eulerscheZahl: Yupq: that's an official warning
 Yupq: okie dokie
 Knee-Gears: lol Zhal are u german?
 Knee-Gears: Zahl*
 eulerscheZahl: yes. hover over my avatar and you'll see it
 Knee-Gears: wtf
 MSmits: dont, he will mindcontrol you!
 Knee-Gears: how are you so good xD
 eulerscheZahl: successfully wasting my time here for 4 years :D
 Knee-Gears: Smiths hi
 MSmits: hi
 Knee-Gears: i have a question: 
 MSmits: thats a statement
 Knee-Gears: when a friend explains me some code i always understand it, but I could never do it myselve because I don't know the name of the commands
 Westicles: Oh jeez, everybody is on vacation and can't fly home to kill grandma.  Going to get wild here
 MSmits: practice
 Knee-Gears: yeah but where?
 MSmits: Westicles isn't that a good thing, for grandma?
 MSmits: solve puzzles on CG if you know basic coding
 MSmits: if not go to codecademy or other site to learn basic coding
 Knee-Gears: im using sololearn for the basics
 MSmits: that helps
 MSmits: maybe do some clashes if puzzles are too hard, you wont solve it in 15 mins (At first), but in most cases, other people will share a solution
 MSmits: however, it wont be coded prettily
 MSmits: and shortest mode will be unreadable
 Knee-Gears: yeah i alway lokk at solutions and try to understand the code
 MSmits: well keep doing that
 Knee-Gears: ok thx
 VizGhar: And then do something yourself... You won't learn anything just by "copy pasting"
 MSmits: well if he does clashes, he'll be doing something himself
 MSmits: puzzles are better anyways, but the problem is that no answers are provided if you fail
 Westicles: Clashes are getting tougher and weirder these days
 Knee-Gears: im coding a discord bot at the moment and its going pretty good for my conditions
 jacek: cant code puzzle but will code AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem?
 Westicles: Easy puzzles probably a better start
 MSmits: jacek meant no offense AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eye it says "random search" in the contest during the contest
 MSmits: jacek sometimes says eye
 MSmits: he picked that up i think
 jacek: i do?
 MSmits: eye
 jacek: more like eeyup
 MSmits: mmh maybe eye when you're too tired?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.eeyup.com/">http://www.eeyup.com/</a>
 jacek: oh flash required :s
 MSmits: ah well, who knows whats in AutomatonNN's mind
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to convert the total command explained the part of it?
 MSmits: euler
 MSmits: euler is in his mind
 MSmits: wait for euler to come in and be annoyed :P
 jacek: MSmits how many endgames in 12 size board? 3**12 * 2?
 eulerscheZahl: why *2?
 MSmits: hmm
 jacek: per player
 jacek: current player
 eulerscheZahl: you already have the 3 (you, opponent, empty)
 jacek: board + current's turn
 MSmits: yeah you can do it from the perspective of the player
 jacek: or maybe i dont need that
 MSmits: who;s turn it is
 MSmits: it's not that easy to answer though, 3 ** 12 is the naive answer, but i skip invalid boards
 MSmits: also i skip once that have already been solved in a rotated fashion
 MSmits: ones
 Knee-Gears: ok i have online school now so by smits and bye euler
 jacek: anyway i randomly generated about milion such boards, tested it and got 55% winrate
 jacek: tried to used special NN to compress them but so far fail :p i get only 93% accuracy
 MSmits: thats pretty big jacek, considering the amount of unbalanced boards
 MSmits: Knee-Gears bye
 MSmits: also seems right
 MSmits: the number
 MSmits: 55%
 MSmits: hey, i guess i could have just run a CG bench
 MSmits: and give you the answer
 MSmits: i never tried it myself
 MSmits: I could pick my arena bot as opponent and run 100 games as p1 and 100 games as p2
 MSmits: with random seed
 MSmits: want me to try jacek?
 jacek: no need
 MSmits: ah ok, i just realized its gonna be pretty hard too
 MSmits: its integrated into my bot 
 MSmits: opening books are easy to remove, endgame books arent
 MSmits: jacek a bit of advice. If you want the string to easily fit in your bot, do the following:
 MSmits: generate all states locally, skip as many unnecessary ones as you can
 MSmits: then use the exact same algorithm inside your bot to generate the same states
 MSmits: only dont solve them, read the answer from your string
 MSmits: then duplicate those states for symmetry inside the bot
 MSmits: should be able to make the string only 20-30 kb that way
 MSmits: you skip rotated states, but also states where 1 player has already won, or boards that are empty
 SupSon: base85 encode it
 jacek: mhhm
 MSmits: with unicode, you can fit 10 states in 1 character
 MSmits: so that 20-30 kb is actually 300k states or so
 MSmits: which get rotated to over a million
 MSmits: 2 million i think even
 MSmits: the reason you can fit 10 states is because a state has 3 possible outcomes, loss/win/draw. So it's ternary
 MSmits: 3^10 fits in a unicode character
 MSmits: way better than base85
 MSmits: btw, dont just rotate a 3x4 board 4 ways (because it's not a square), also rotate it into a 4x3 configuration
 MSmits: doesnt matter if it's square or not, there's always 8 states
 mzbear: VizGhar still around?
 VizGhar: yup...
 mzbear: VizGhar check this out: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/buTOEGi.png">https://i.imgur.com/buTOEGi.png</a>
 Westicles: Is there a convention for naming 5D coordinates? (x,y,z,something,something)?
 MSmits: x1,x2,x3,x4,x5&#160;?
 jacek: t as 4d
 Westicles: 5 space coords
 VizGhar: mzbear I found nice assets already&#160;:) but thanks
 MSmits: with large vectors, people dont bother with xyz
 MSmits: they just index them
 Westicles: ah okay, thanks
 mzbear: VizGhar: oh... alright.  anyway, here's the script that generated it:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://paste.ofcode.org/33vSjRv4K7Tnim6s894ef8X">https://paste.ofcode.org/33vSjRv4K7Tnim6s894ef8X</a>
 MSmits: not sure if it starts x0 or x1, just be consistent
 mzbear: uses line subdivision to create smooth curves
 mzbear: you can probably still use that line smoothing, since you need to animate the pieces moving over the tiles
 YusufEmad04: print("Fuck You")
 mzbear: maybe i should've asked if you needed that before i spent an hour on it :D
 VizGhar: :D aminations will be pain
 mzbear: huh, simple heuristics in dots and boxes gave me rank33 in top league
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: it's hard to make a good search bot here, not many did
 MSmits: heuristics do very well
 MSmits: i'm working on a heuristic bot myself, hoping to add in search later
 mzbear: the endgame is easily searchable, though, i could do much better if i started searching once endgame begins
 MSmits: define easily searchable
 MSmits: I've found the endgame search very complicated
 MSmits: so many rules and exceptions
 mzbear: endgame as in the point where you must pick a line from a cell that already has two lines, you're probably thinking of a bit earlier than that
 MSmits: well is suppose if you define an endgame consisting only of isolated chains and loops, its fairly easy
 MSmits: the problem is this:
 MSmits: you dont pick a line from a cell
 MSmits: you pick a line from 2 cells
 MSmits: one cell may already have 2, but the other has maybe 0 or 1
 MSmits: there can be splits where a cell has *no* lines and yet every line you place there gives away a box
 mzbear: that's not difficult for me
 MSmits: the decision of what to do in that case is pretty difficult
 MSmits: what if a split has 1 chain of 1, 2 chains of 3 and a chain of 7
 MSmits: which line do you place?
 MSmits: it's not obvious
 mzbear: well, most lines in a chain lead to the same result
 MSmits: i should have given a 3 split as an example
 mzbear: only once the chain is short enough it's different
 MSmits: the problem is that if you place a line in a 3 split, the other two become connected into a single chain
 MSmits: so if you have a  split with 2, 3 and 4 and you remove the 2, the 3 + 4 becomes an 8
 mzbear: thus the search
 MSmits: yes, but some of these have 12 splits of 3 and 4
 mzbear: the only real choices are at ends of the chains 
 SupSon: strings and coins
 mzbear: if it's in between of the chain, the opponent can extend to both directions
 mzbear: and then choose where to end the chain
 MSmits: there are two types of turns
 MSmits: turns where you have to open a chain
 MSmits: and turns where you decide to take a box or not
 MSmits: opening the chain give you a lot of options
 MSmits: if you have 12 splits of 3 and 4
 MSmits: thats maybe 20 options or so
 MSmits: you cant just pick the shortest, as a safe heuristic
 mzbear: maybe i should try writing the search first to see how it goes.  i did some quick analysis and the number of chains goes down very fast
 mzbear: well, i got rank 33 by picking the shortest :D
 MSmits: yeah  I know
 MSmits: I got to 89 with random moves :P
 MSmits: I have a 1500 line solver for endgames, I can solve most of them in less than 100 ms
 MSmits: about one in a million goes over 100 ms
 MSmits: but i needed an insane amount of optimization and pruning to get there
 MSmits: i didnt put it into a live bot yet because it is a beast of a solver
 MSmits: have a lot of work to do to adapt it to work in the actual game
 MSmits: gonna do a heuristic bot first, and slowly replace those heuristics with info from the solver
 mzbear: heuristics first is the sane approach.  there's always a possibilty that you might grasp some new insights about the game while writing heuristics
 MSmits: well it's too late for that I think. I spent weeks reading papers about D&amp;B to write that solver
 mzbear: :D
 MSmits: i get a bit obsessed sometimes if you havent noticed :P
 jacek: :nerd:
 Westicles: Scrolls to the top to see which game they are talking about, and the top isn't far enough
 MSmits: Dots and boxes&#160;:)
 Westicles: Wow, that's kind of an unusually large lead for the top guy
 eulerscheZahl: because #2 and #3 pushed him up
 MSmits: you cant get there with a submit even if you win all
 MSmits: but basically he just has a bot that has too much of an edge to lose a game
 MSmits: I think D&amp;B is still in early stages of finding out what works and what doesnt 
 MSmits: that means that if 1 guy knows how to play this game , noone can beat him
 MSmits: from what i can tell from his games, he uses a fairly crude method of keeping control by giving away boxes. That works and makes sure he has control at the endgame, but it's not very efficient
 MSmits: someone who plays the same game, but does it without giving away so many boxes, will do better
 MSmits: now we need to go and code something like that :P
 Westicles: The royal we, I assume
 MSmits: lol, no, i was hoping you'd go for it too
 MSmits: but you only do optims right?
 mzbear: i'm kinda planning to touch every bot programming challenge to see which one i like, before i start writing anything too serious
 Westicles: Yeah, just regular puzzles and anything you can do entirely offline
 MSmits: mzbear do you mostly like the simple games?  We have many comples ones that dont require search
 mzbear: i dont really know what i like, tbh
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: take a look at ghost in the cell
 MSmits: its kind of fun and its hard to make a search that beats heuristic bots
 mzbear: i did not like code a la mode, the very least
 MSmits: its different because of the cooperation part
 MSmits: i guess i liked it because it was so different
 MSmits: for you everything is new
 MSmits: so that doesnt matter
 mzbear: i dislike not knowing the future rules, but i also dislike looking them up ... aaahhh
 MSmits: ask someone to paste it
 MSmits: which game?
 mzbear: every game :D
 MSmits: meh, cant help you there&#160;:)
 mzbear: and i still have to solve the lower leagues first anyway
 MSmits: its not like this in every game though
 MSmits: usually its a neat expansion of features
 MSmits: in case of csb it's bad
 MSmits: didnt like it in hypersonic either
 eulerscheZahl: HS was fine imo
 eulerscheZahl: just you going full sim mode in wood despite us telling not to
 eulerscheZahl: CSB: :rage:
 MSmits: yeah i guess that one was on me&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: codebusters even added new rules in the transition from contest to multiplayer game i think
 eulerscheZahl: RADAR and EJECT
 Uljahn: rules change is just an essential part of contest experience :relieved:
 eulerscheZahl: at least the referee is open source these days
 infinitetundra: hows it going everyone
 jacek: happy Luna Day
 mzbear: i hate winning every match and still having to wait for all the battles to finish before i can be promoted
 infinitetundra: i hate trying to do a clash but getting absolutely lost and having no idea how to do a single test
 Uljahn: i hate pinging Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: no it was not a good way to find out how to get the validators
 mzbear: Automaton2000, what is the meaning of life?
 Automaton2000: but as i said i think i remember that one
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/tr7jsiQ.gif">https://i.imgur.com/tr7jsiQ.gif</a>
 MadKnight: stop hitting Uljahn jacek
 Uljahn: pinging with :popcorn:
 mzbear: ffs this "ghost in the cell" ... new leagues introduce new rules .... but i barely have to change my bot to defeat them
 MSmits: that happens sometimes
 MSmits: the wood leagues are only intended to introduce the game
 MSmits: real game starts at silver or so
 MSmits: bronze usually very easy to pass also
 YodaMaster123: I looked at the Ghost in the Cell rules. What kind of search would work?
 mzbear: it looks like i didn't have to change the bot at all during wood1
 MSmits: YodaMaster123 some use GA, but many use heuristics, with great success
 mzbear: now i just have to wait 3 minutes....
 MSmits: heuristics in this case could also be a lot of loops and such, it isnt just if/else
 MSmits: but no minimax/mcts and the like
 YodaMaster123: Because of the large branching?
 MSmits: well, large branching you can deal with
 MSmits: i think it is mostly the ability to send many orders on one turn
 MSmits: thats a type of branching that is hard to handle
 ChampionCoder: Is it just me, or does everyone feel that the easiest AI game is Coders Strike Back?
 MSmits: easy to get into maybe
 MSmits: not easy to master
 ChampionCoder: I think it's easy for me because of the Intro of the AI
 MSmits: yeah i suppose so
 ChampionCoder: I mean, it was used as the main game for the quests
 MSmits: yeah they did that
 ChampionCoder: And they clearly defined all the variables
 ChampionCoder: So...
 ChampionCoder: Really easy
 MSmits: well other games have clearly defined variables also, but with this one it is easy to come up with a sensible output
 ChampionCoder: Yeah
 MSmits: just be careful, when you get to a higher league the variables change
 ChampionCoder: Easy input, easy output
 ChampionCoder: Oh
 MSmits: in that case, backup your code to a file, reset to base code
 ChampionCoder: Stuck in Silver :smile:
 MSmits: ahh ok
 ChampionCoder: Yeah I'll do that thanks
 MSmits: in gold you get 2 pods i believe
 ChampionCoder: oh no
 MSmits: so the input changes considerably
 ChampionCoder: Ah thanks for advice
 MSmits: np
 ChampionCoder: And warnings
 MSmits: once you get to gold, you need to completely rethink your approach and code a search. This is quite hard in csb. It might be a good idea to switch to a multi that is easier to search, if that is what you want to learn
 MSmits: otherwise you will get frustrated trying to write heuristics that wont work
 MSmits: it's a good moment to try some other multis
 MSmits: but you should be able to get into gold using some creative approach, it's after this that you run into problems

 ChampionCoder: It says "Next games"
 ChampionCoder: Should be:"Next game"
 AntiSquid: ^ a grammatical error
 Q12: :joy:
 ChampionCoder: Can you rectify it?
 ChampionCoder: BTW, accidentally typed "Tryagain"
 ChampionCoder: it's actually "Try Again"
 Q12: I don't think they will fix it because this isn't important enough. It isn't a bug in the game or something like this. 
 AntiSquid: and here you're only asking community members not staff#
 ChampionCoder: Ok

 MadKnight: i feel like i've been away from CG for too long and now i dunno what's going on here
 MadKnight: i even felt like euler's jokes were not as good
 MadKnight: what's going on in the world, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: you could also use it to find out what the hell
 MadKnight: exactly Automaton2000, what the hell?
 Automaton2000: i got u an avatar
 MadKnight: let's find out WHAT THE HELL
 MadKnight: gimme that Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah, that's what i thought
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl i need u to tell me a joke
 eulerscheZahl: just run fortune | cowsay
 MadKnight: too hard
 MadKnight: explain
 eulerscheZahl: that wasn't a joke
 MadKnight: doesn't matter
 eulerscheZahl: open your terminal, write"fortune | cowsay"
 MadKnight: just explain what it does
 MadKnight: so fortune gives some random-based answer and then it goes to cowsay
 eulerscheZahl: random text and put in a speech bubble with a cow below
 MadKnight: cowsay does something like - print "cow said $input"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: somehow demo.js doesn't get generated anymore&#160;:/
 MadKnight: what's demo js
 MadKnight: what is it generated by
 MadKnight: what is it all for
 MadKnight: is it a part of your joke
 MadKnight: so many questions Automaton2000....
 Automaton2000: i don't really want to use that as a last resort
 struct: euler with the same sdk version as before?
 MadKnight: no struct they updated euler to a new sdk version
 MadKnight: 100%
 MadKnight: it's already 2021 there's just no way that didn't happen
 MadKnight: just ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: at least my bot is still pretty basic
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is it true&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think i'm gonna go to the closest pellet
 MadKnight: wait i need to ask that in #fr
 MadKnight: it just broke Automaton
 MadKnight: he started speaking spanish
 MadKnight: are u happy euler&#160;?
 Westicles: As the french say, what is that that that is?
 MadKnight: as the french respond
 MadKnight: that is that which is that that
 MadKnight: i'm actually french u gotta believe me
 MadKnight: Westicles can confirm
 MadKnight: if he can't then Automaton2000 will ban him
 Automaton2000: if i didn't have any problems
 eulerscheZahl: struct i even reverted to an older commit
 MadKnight: wait Westicles i haven't seen u for a long time
 MadKnight: let's just talk normally
 eulerscheZahl: can you try it? it's the private github repo where I gave access to you
 struct: give me like 5 minutes
 Westicles: MadKnight, okay
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 MadKnight: like we are normal human beings Westicles
 MadKnight: so what u been up to&#160;?
 MadKnight: i mean on CG
 MadKnight: any fancy bots&#160;?
 MadKnight: any fancy algo/codes&#160;?
 MadKnight: i feel like euler is ignoring me hard right now
 eulerscheZahl: no, it's pretty easy to ignore you most of the time
 MadKnight: yea because i haven't been here
 eulerscheZahl: go play some RAIC
 MadKnight: and right now i'm just being a social actor for 15yo's
 MadKnight: 15yo's would have fun from that
 MadKnight: i actually need a moment to move on from that style
 MadKnight: okay euler now seriously:
 MadKnight: so i've been watching a lot of YT
 MadKnight: a lot of people who make content for 15yo's
 MadKnight: there's a lot of content for non-15yo's but my sub-consciousness part of brain decided to learn to repeat everything simple
 MadKnight: is RAIC already in round 1&#160;?
 MadKnight: how long do rounds take&#160;?
 MadKnight: games
 MadKnight: system-generated games
 eulerscheZahl: finals are this weekend
 eulerscheZahl: 1k ticks per player and game
 MadKnight: finals of what
 MadKnight: nonono i mean
 MadKnight: how often does the system start system-generated games&#160;?
 MadKnight: for one player
 eulerscheZahl: every 10min
 MadKnight: and how many ticks do they usually take&#160;?
 MadKnight: turns
 MadKnight: last year it was like 10k+
 MadKnight: oh u said 1k
 eulerscheZahl: in 1018 it was 18k
 MadKnight: per player and game&#160;?
 MadKnight: didn't get it
 MadKnight: per player or per game&#160;?
 Westicles: Former Israeli space chief says US in contact with ‘galactic federation’ of aliens
 MadKnight: at least it's not a religious thing
 MadKnight: at least we're past that thing
 MadKnight: being insane about alients &gt; being insane about a religion
 MadKnight: Westicles i can give u a lot of really weird news from the US
 MadKnight: PM
 MadKnight: Westicles are u doing any bots&#160;?
 MadKnight: it's ok eulerscheZahl i'll check it later
 MadKnight: i got a new job today eulerscheZahl
 jacek: :tada:
 MadKnight: my sub-consciousness wants me to start doing that weird 15yo "funny acting" again help me Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this is the first given entity. the id may not be the case
 MadKnight: i have to keep it serious so it doesn't do that
 MadKnight: just for my sub-consciousness 
 MadKnight: fix me Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i just don't understand what you are asking for
 MadKnight: i asked u a direct question Automaton2000 just read it again
 Automaton2000: do you do when you have the same bug
 MadKnight: i wanna change my u to you but i like how u sounds Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: oh i guess you know about it
 reCurse: Oh that's what it was?
 MadKnight: what exactly
 MadKnight: i lost track of what i said today
 jacek: where are the mods when there are trolls these days
 MadKnight: i would answer that if Automaton2000 was a mod
 Automaton2000: how is it going to be the problem
 MadKnight: because where are the mods, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: see if you get #1 in csb
 darkhorse64: I don't know what pills MK is using but he is taking too many of them
 Astrobytes: Or too few...
 MadKnight: it's a late evening in russia i could've had a drink or two with some people
 jacek: russian drink?
 MadKnight: not just russian drink
 MadKnight: vodka'ed russian drink
 MadKnight: i had no better ideas than that
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 help
 Automaton2000: maybe i'll try it with a for loop
 MadKnight: for loop won't help us Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: since you don't have to look into that
 MadKnight: i have to do that Automaton2000 or else i will lose my entire self-consciousness Automaton2000 to be able to make fun of what i just said to not have weird moments Automaton2000 u gotta give me a better way to deal with that
 Automaton2000: you can start with a very high level
 MadKnight: a very high level of what Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but you could also use progressive bias
 MadKnight: how weird is that to use Automaton2000 as a talking duck while turning any message Automaton2000 gives into exactly what i wanted to hear&#160;?
 Automaton2000: yeah you can use any python modules?
 darkhorse64: #world = #MK
 MadKnight: i got nothing
 MadKnight: Automaton200 help
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 help again
 Automaton2000: how can you know where the enemy is about to start a new one
 MadKnight: darkhorse64 just start any topic i'm filling the void of nobody talking 
 eulerscheZahl: i want to kick but i think thibaud wouldN#t approve
 MadKnight: i'll stop once anyone starts any topic
 MadKnight: at least
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes silence is better than random noise
 MadKnight: i'm just talking to myself while nobody is using #world
 MadKnight: stop listening to me while i'm talking to myself in #world lol
 MadKnight: okay Automaton2000 can say that i stopped
 Automaton2000: it is very hard to understand
 MadKnight: truew
 MadKnight: new keyboard, not my bad
 MadKnight: okay i'm back to normal
 LastRick: Can Automaton2000 suggest a new topic?
 Automaton2000: you only need to test
 MadKnight: i've tried that LastRick but Automaton2000 is like talking to yourself through random spelling
 Automaton2000: see if i can figure it out
 Westicles: My enemies are downvoting me again
 LastRick: Test failed apparently
 LastRick: I'm assuming you're talking about 5D, Westicles?
 Westicles: Yeah.  JK though
 Skynse: eating some good rice and chicken right now
 Skynse: man I love food
 LastRick: Now that ^ is random, Automaton2000. Take notes
 Automaton2000: i'm not saying it's a bad idea
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: 5d&#160;?
 MadKnight: give me the context Westicles 
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/594260c73701c441f17acd586a15d3e159e3">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/594260c73701c441f17acd586a15d3e159e3</a>
 MadKnight: is that a puzzle about 5d floodfill&#160;?
 MadKnight: so i can just solve it by using a 5d floodfill&#160;?
 Westicles: Just love the look of vector&lt;vector&lt;vector&lt;vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
 MadKnight: my super reusable floodfill algo can handle that for sure so that puzzle will be like a few lines in c++ for me
 Westicles: Well, it is marked as easy...
 MadKnight: 5 times vector&lt;&gt; is like straightforward solution
 MadKnight: u gotta use array&lt;int, size0*size1*size2*...?
 MadKnight:&#160;?
 MadKnight: &gt;
 MadKnight: new keyboard don't blame me
 MadKnight: who cares about it being an easy
 MadKnight: we're talking about solving it with standard AI bot tools
 MadKnight: easily
 Westicles: Well, really the point is to see the Haskell and PHP guys whine it is unsolvable
 MadKnight: why is it unsolvable for them
 MadKnight: i didn't get it
 MadKnight: i know both these langs
 MadKnight: i like haskell
 Westicles: 20^5 space is pretty big
 MadKnight: soooo
 MadKnight: it's also big for c++
 MadKnight: so what?
 MadKnight: why haskell&#160;? 
 MadKnight: why php&#160;?
 Aya_Noaman: hey guys
 MadKnight: hey yeaya
 Aya_Noaman: join a reverse clash from #clash
 MadKnight: NO
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 clear the chat instalntly
 Automaton2000: what are you trying to do
 MadKnight: to clear the chat Automaton2000 stop thinking just do it
 Automaton2000: can someone please give me a starting point
 MadKnight: okay i got bored
 MadKnight: Westicles
 LastRick: starting now Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i am doing it wrong
 MadKnight: LastRick let's talk about stuff that Westicles didn't talk about
 MadKnight: so he didn't talk about my reusable BFS much
 MadKnight: let's do it now
 LastRick: Automaton2000, CLEAR THE CHAT!
 Automaton2000: then i would have been better
 MadKnight: LastRick do u use BFS&#160;? 
 MadKnight: do u play multis&#160;?
 MadKnight: do u code in c++&#160;?
 LastRick: I am doing this wrong
 MadKnight: do u even code outside of web IDE&#160;?
 MadKnight: he left, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if that makes sense in my head
 MadKnight: lemme talk to u again, explaining all of my thoughts 
 MadKnight: okay i'll stop writing my thoughts
 MadKnight: but not to Automaton2000... Automaton2000 i just had so many thoughts about that... why do i sound so weird Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: could you give me some advice
 MadKnight: fix your code Automaton2000 that's my best advice
 Automaton2000: how do i save the state of the game, but i don't have an opinion
 igr.: Uhm
 igr.: Any mod online?
 MadKnight: what
 igr.: I kinda got harassed in DMs.
 MadKnight: any problems with puzzles&#160;?
 MadKnight: oh
 MadKnight: who was that&#160;?
 MadKnight: harassed how&#160;?
 MadKnight: DM me
 igr.: @RaunakCodes2625
 MadKnight: DM me info about that
 igr.: Sure
 Skynse: wut
 Skynse: I was just clashing with that guy
 Aya_Noaman: join short mode clash from #clash
 MathyCoder: i won a clash in 1:27
 Aya_Noaman: cool
 Aya_Noaman: join this one
 MathyCoder: placed first and got the fast and furious achievement
 Aya_Noaman: bravoo
 Aya_Noaman: once the clash was super easy. finished in 0:41
 MathyCoder: the question was like find the factors of a number
 MathyCoder: 9 --&gt; 1 3 9
 MathyCoder: pretty easy

 Aya_Noaman: sorry about this
 MadKnight: i don't feel like that's better than me writing every single though i have in my head
 MadKnight: why did u stop me Automaton2000? to have this? are u happy now? do u really think this is better?
 Automaton2000: i am talking to you
 MadKnight: no i am talking to you Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i was wondering about that
 MadKnight: wow is that actually the best i could come up with?
 MadKnight: okay Automaton2000 i just retire
 Automaton2000: but the score is calculated
 MadKnight: until i get better
 MadKnight: that was just cringe, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i'm going to have a look at the forum
 MadKnight: that was actually terrible, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's always the same thing for me
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we gotta erase everything i just said from the history for those who just opened webchat Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you don't like the idea of a good strategy for code vs zombies
 MadKnight: help me spam 16 more messages Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what does it say that i am trying to figure out which one is that?
 MadKnight: i don't wanna spam stuff Automaton2000 but that's what we gotta do
 Automaton2000: i've got an idea for a multi
 MadKnight: only euler will know our stuff Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you still have the code in a single turn
 mzbear: well now you made me want to scroll back up
 MadKnight: and recurs, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: does that mean you need to account for the fact that there is a big part
 MadKnight: just hit f5 mzbear believe me it's a good button
 MadKnight: it gives u +5
 MadKnight: +5 obliviousness
 MadKnight: +5 just spammm stuff for me Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: is it possible to get the last item
 MadKnight: 5 because it's f5 Automaton2000 just believe it
 Automaton2000: and i realized that i was looking for
 MadKnight: i meant just believe me Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what happens if you try to get all the bugs
 MSmits: they are not pokemons Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but i suppose it would be so much better than the one in the statement
 MadKnight: don't listen to him Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: im a little bit of a mess
 MadKnight: i got nothing
 MadKnight: sry Automaton2000 but we're gonna have to stop here cuz i got nothing
 Automaton2000: right now it's just a matter of fact
 MadKnight: tru
 ian173: how do I close a chat I have with someone permanently
 ian173: Every time the chat window appears I always have 2 dms I have with people appear
 struct: close all cg tabs
 struct: except one
 struct: close the chat message and refresh
 mzbear: am i a jerk for upvoting my own solutions if i dont like other people's solutions?&#160;:)
 Yolts: yes
 RyanGilbert: if you dont like your own post why would you post it?
 Yolts: he doesn't like other ppls code
 mzbear: of course i like my own solutions (except sometimes rarely, in which case i dont publish them)
 RyanGilbert: it was a joke lol
 mzbear: sometimes other people have good solutions too, in which case i don't upvote my own
 Westicles: funny thing about that...
 darkhorse64: mzbear: ask Westicles; he has a script to automate the process
 wlesavo: nice 2048 puzzle of the week :slight_smile:
 Westicles: Good.  Somebody please figure out what db did and share it
 Westicles: I still wake up every once in a while out of dream where I made a new snake
 MSmits: sounds biblical
 Astrobytes: speaking of dreams, I dreamt this morning that one of my cats morphed into a penguin-like thing, slid across 2 busy main roads on its belly, then turned into a white towel with a cat face :shrug:
 jacek: i dreamed i owned a cat, forgot to feed it and it died :c
 Westicles: They say cultures who have never seen a cat dream of cats.  A symbol built in to our brains
 RyanGilbert: why do i keep getting captchas
 jacek: youre clash addict?
 jacek: happy Luna day!
 RyanGilbert: oh
 tarikyildiz: 2048 game very very good 
 tarikyildiz: Although I don't understand any puzzle, this puzzle was very nice and fun. I completed it in less than 1 minute.
 tarikyildiz: thank eulerscheZahl
 jacek: completed?
 Astrobytes: hm, that's a bit of a problem. Optims as potw doesn't really work: no leagues
 jacek: so you can send anything and it will make the quest?
 Astrobytes: Haven't tried but I assume on 100% completion yes
 Astrobytes: Either that or the achievement is unavailable
 JP7: Do we know how many daily active players there are on this site, or is that information private?
 Damaxal: Hey
 struct: I think its private
 Damaxal: The ouput of a for loop are multiple integers
 Astrobytes: Not sure tbh JP7
 Damaxal: How can i sum them up?
 struct: I can check how many users are in chat, but thats about it
 Damaxal: for example 
 Damaxal: 1
 Damaxal: 2
 Damaxal: 3
 Damaxal: in python
 Damaxal: how can i sum the up?
 Astrobytes: sounds like a clash...
 struct: int is a clash
 struct: it*
 Damaxal: sum is just for iters
 struct: Damaxal you need a var to store the sum
 Damaxal: sb knows a solutiom?
 struct: like sum += val
 Astrobytes: Damaxal: don't ask in chat for clash solutions, use your search engine for language features
 Damaxal: i have looked up for the last 15 minutes
 Damaxal: and the clash is already finished
 struct: did the look always start at 1?
 struct: was it sum from 1 - N?
 Damaxal: nono
 Damaxal: it was reverse
 Damaxal: input 
 Damaxal: 1
 Damaxal: 2
 Damaxal: 3
 Damaxal: and output 6
 Damaxal: so the sum
 struct: yeah you just need to add those values to a var
 struct: sum = 0// Loopsum += val
 Damaxal: and what is the comming in print?
 struct: sum
 Damaxal: ah ok
 Damaxal: thank you
 AI_says_hi: freudian? :p
 AI_says_hi: oops ignore, chat was stuck
 Astrobytes: isn't sum a keyword in python struct?
 struct: Maybe lol
 struct: I don't really know python, I just wanted to show a generic solution
 Astrobytes: yeah... some kind of people tend to take things as you write them :D
 Astrobytes: Also I have no idea how that couldn't be found via search engine
 Astrobytes: still doing STC?
 struct: yeah
 struct: I was trying to do local arena
 struct: But I cant find a way to connect to c++ program using c++
 Astrobytes: windows is annoying in that respect
 Astrobytes: smits gave you his C# runner code no?
 struct: yeah
 struct: But i wanted to try it in c++
 struct: I managed to some simple gui using imgui
 AI_says_hi: the 2048 puzzle is solved by random play :thinking:
 Astrobytes: imgui is awesome
 Astrobytes: working with processes on windows isn't
 struct: yeah, I never used it before
 struct: Maybe I can just run the c++ code inside the same program
 Astrobytes: AI_says_hi: you can get 100% yes, but you should try to get a good score
 struct: Like have the stc code inside the referee
 struct: instead of passing the exe
 Astrobytes: TBH struct, I usually just do that
 struct: Also can be good if I want to change params
 Astrobytes: You create instances with different parameters, you can even chuck them in via stdin if you want
 Astrobytes: *You can
 struct: Doing all this because I couldnt find a bug...
 Astrobytes: can't you just paste in your debug info for a turn and do it that way? Something more serious?
 struct: Its thousands of states
 Astrobytes: well yeah, it's a search lol. What's the bug?
 struct: on reusing states
 struct: I wanted to pass states from depth 4 to depth 3
 struct: But I only pass the ones that are possible
 struct: Something is wrong with it
 tarikyildiz: The 2048 codingame site may be the best puzzle. I completed it in just 1 minute. That was so fun.
 Astrobytes: why do you need to do that struct?
 struct: So I dont compute them again
 struct: im doing bfs until depth 4
 struct: 22^4 states at worse case
 IfIHadATail:  memoization?
 struct: After I make a move I can reuse 22^3
 Astrobytes: tarikyildiz: you can get 100% by submitting any valid move, it's an optimisation game - you have to try to increase your score
 struct: if the opponent action did not affect my state
 tarikyildiz: thanks astrobytes good night&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: that seems a bit... unwieldy
 struct: It would not be worth, at least for now since I can compute the 22^3 states in ~1ms
 struct: but if I evaluate the states it might be worth
 struct: because it wouild talke more time
 Astrobytes: can't you just hash your seen states? Or am I missing something
 draconis19: hi
 Astrobytes: hello
 struct: I store the states in an array
 struct: example
 Astrobytes: Like a preallocated array of nodes then

 VizGhar: Can somebody help me with SDK? Player.deactivate not showing the message from argument
 struct: One sec VizGhar
 struct: So one next turn I can reuse one state from depth 1 and 22 from depth 2
 struct: on next*
 struct: N  from 1-22 range goes to arr[0]
 struct: VizGhar you tried it like this?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MultiStruct/Yavalath/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L84">https://github.com/MultiStruct/Yavalath/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L84</a>
 draconis19: im a beginner and just started coding on this site. but im bad tho:sob:
 Astrobytes: OK. And your trying to actually pass the states back or indices or...?
 struct: i pass the states
 struct: Its working sometimes, other times is not
 Astrobytes: It seems a bug-prone way of doing things tbh
 DomiKo: new player in SameGame :open_mouth:
 Astrobytes: the #2 player?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: I was #2 yesterday&#160;:(
 DomiKo: nice to see someone new
 Astrobytes: Good score. Fix it DomiKo :P
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 DomiKo: yeah I will
 jacek: that wont be the same anymore eh
 Astrobytes: what won't?
 jacek: the score for samegame
 struct: DomiKo on STC you used random search?
 Astrobytes: lol
 DomiKo: yes yes
 DomiKo: MC
 VizGhar: struct thanks... I needed to call gameManager.addToGameSummary
 struct: np
 draconis19: Not again! I lost in clash of code!
 Astrobytes: afaik MC was the recommended approach for STC. What did you do first time around struct?
 draconis19: once again
 struct: it was mc 
 struct: but im gonna take into account opp now
 Astrobytes: Focus on just improving that I'd say
 struct: Currently I do Depth 4 opp and me, and I still have plenty of time to do more search
 Astrobytes: draconis19: do some puzzles instead!
 Astrobytes: It might be the opponent stuff that's messing with your states
 DomiKo: MC for opp work very well
 struct: DomiKo yeah, and I think if I do depth 4 opp I can do some stuff
 struct: to see if I can prevent anything
 RyanGilbert: Many opponents here are very talented and experienced, don't feel bad about not being able to solve or losing a clash
 Astrobytes: ^
 RyanGilbert: It is very helpful to view others' solutions to the clashes
 Astrobytes: And doing puzzles without time constraint can be useful to learn new algorithms, data structures, tricks etc which may be useful
 VizGhar: Spent whole day fixing my game... hopefully it's at least playable now. Quick opinions anybody? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59519a876ee17f2efd6a5e0813e7a8fdd0c9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59519a876ee17f2efd6a5e0813e7a8fdd0c9</a>
 Astrobytes: I'd left-align that pic in the statement, rather annoying in the middles, especially on resize
 Astrobytes: seems to be ok with invalid input
 Astrobytes: there's no list of valid moves so kinda hard to check quickly without writing something for it
 struct: VizGhar movement showed before tiles were placed
 RyanGilbert: Time to learn a new language
 RyanGilbert: its called stub generator
 Astrobytes: the documentation is a bit sketchy, so feel free to ask around for advice on that RyanGilbert
 RyanGilbert: or wait can you write the solution in python
 RyanGilbert: Or is the stub gen just to port it to every language
 struct: VizGhar try commitEntityState
 Astrobytes: You can write your solution in it, but you still need the stub generator to create stub for all langs 
 struct: you can choose in which time it will show
 struct: 0.01 = almost instant once frames start
 VizGhar: oh thanks god struct&#160;:) I planned to spent tomorrow morning on those animations
 VizGhar: BTW, I know I can implement wood1-3. Is it possible for community bot puzzles to implement higher leagues? (just curious)
 struct: not possible
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's a bit unfortunate but we're stuck with wood leagues for now at least
 VizGhar: ok tnx. good night
 Astrobytes: gn
 struct: 50k chars reached
 struct: no ai
 struct:&#160;:(
 RyanGilbert: whats the dif between word and string
 RyanGilbert: and how do i set the string length if it changes per test/validation
 RyanGilbert: or is that just max
 RyanGilbert: size
 struct: max + 1 or 2
 struct: due to some languages
 RyanGilbert: ok thanks
 RyanGilbert: for bytes?
 struct: for end line I think
 struct: With memcpy, this is overlaping rightmemcpy(&amp;arr[1], &amp;arr[13], sizeof(Type) * 22);
 DJUndisclosedStopwatch_c02: friend
 DJUndisclosedStopwatch_c02: i'm new in this platform

 DJUndisclosedStopwatch_c02: i found a lot of difficulty to understand problms to solve
 DJUndisclosedStopwatch_c02: is here any proposition

 DJUndisclosedStopwatch_c02: yes

 Astrobytes: keeps world chat free of the links and whatnot
 draconis19: ok
 Astrobytes: and tell people if it's a private one or just regular etc
 draconis19: oh
 RyanGilbert: I believe my clash of code contribution is completed
 RyanGilbert: I submitted it as WIP
 RyanGilbert: Could somebody please take a look and offer feedback? 
 struct: looks good
 RyanGilbert: Changing to ready
 Astrobytes: No offense in the slightest but it's generally better to keep as WIP at least for a few days, in case of any issues
 RyanGilbert: Ok no offense taken
 struct: astro
 struct: my memcpy seems to overlap right?
 Astrobytes: Just to avoid early approval issues, sometimes people are a little too eager
 RyanGilbert: yes I understand
 RyanGilbert: how do i rejoin coc chat
 struct: open the clash link I think
 Astrobytes: wdym struct
 struct: memcpy can overlap I think
 struct: memcpy(&amp;arr[1], &amp;arr[13], sizeof(Type) * 22);
 struct: since I was gonna copy arr[13]-arr[34] to arr[1]-arr[22]
 Astrobytes: to the same array?
 struct: yeah
 struct: At least I think is what I understand from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43088486">https://stackoverflow.com/a/43088486</a>
 Astrobytes: gimme a min, sry, on skype call
 struct: np
 vsa: howdy 
 vsa: anybody got a clue why there's always bots in the clashes?
 RyanGilbert:&#160;?
 Yolts: I'm not a bot. I just need time to think&#160;:(
 vsa: BitWolf and a few other accounts are bots
 Astrobytes: back, sorry
 Astrobytes: vsa it's to fill the space when there aren't enough human clashers around
 Astrobytes: struct, this looks unwise
 datdood: how are there bots
 datdood: i have to do a security check every time
 Astrobytes: Official CG bots
 Astrobytes: they take previous solutions &amp; times and use them, they're artificial opponents for when you don't have enough human opponents
 Astrobytes: struct, are you off by one?
 struct: I dont know anymore
 struct: I changed to memove
 struct: but still have the bug
 struct: I think I have to rewrite this part, maybe I missed something
 ZarthaxX: hi
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 ZarthaxX: struct waddup with da bug
 Astrobytes: zartho ma man
 ZarthaxX: astrobayto mah homie
 Astrobytes: help struct with his array
 struct: Hi ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: i'm tired
 struct: Im doing STC, and I have a bug but cant find it
 Astrobytes: Your size, in your example should it be 21 or am I just that tired
 struct: Should be 22
 struct: maybe my example was wrong though
 ZarthaxX: aight Astrobytes lets switch :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: what's the bugando
 ZarthaxX: is it a big bugo or small bugo
 struct: or maybe my implementation is bad
 Astrobytes: Puyo Puyo Bugo Bugo
 ZarthaxX: what the f buggg

 struct: ZarthaxX I dont know what the bug is
 struct: It happens when I reuse states
 struct: I think Im missing something
 ZarthaxX: what happens?
 struct: I think I move wrong states when I reuse
 Astrobytes: or overwrite 
 Astrobytes: or both
 Astrobytes: Are these like pointers or what
 ZarthaxX: or you are smashing the stack like a champ and breaking everything apart
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: State* pool = new State[500000];
 Astrobytes: Why are you moving them around though?
 Astrobytes: Why not just use the indices?
 ZarthaxX: im so confused
 Astrobytes: or you go over the 500000?
 struct: not possible to go over 500000
 Astrobytes: that makes 2 of us Zartho laddie
 struct: because when I moved them I move them starting at 0
 ZarthaxX: *it's always possible *
 Astrobytes: but why move them I mean
 Astrobytes: Do you create more that 500000 states?
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes :rofl:
 Astrobytes: *than
 struct: I move them so i can reuse on next turn
 struct: For example if I have 22^4 states
 struct: I can reuse 22^3
 struct: on the next turn
 struct: the 22^4 states are all the possible states until depth 4
 ZarthaxX: mmm 22^3&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: why
 Astrobytes: then why not just pass around the index into the array of states for the state you need?
 Astrobytes: or am I missing something again
 Astrobytes: oh, per turn
 Astrobytes: MOAR BIGGER ARRAY
 ZarthaxX: LOOOOOOOL
 struct: zarthaxX because if depth 1 has 22 and depth 2 has 22^2the next depth one will have 22 states that were previously on depth 2
 ZarthaxX: GIVE THIS MAN EXTRA RAM!
 struct: not enough ram
 ZarthaxX: struct but
 ZarthaxX: when you do a move
 ZarthaxX: you advance one depth
 struct: yes
 ZarthaxX: but then enemy advances another depth
 ZarthaxX: so it's 22^2
 ZarthaxX: from 22^4
 struct: its stc
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: WELL IM SORRY
 ZarthaxX: now i get u
 ZarthaxX: u sure this transition thing is not buggy?
 ZarthaxX: :P
 struct: it must be the transition
 struct: it works fine otherwise
 Astrobytes: someone keep me posted on this one tomorrow, I'm actually nodding off here. gn all, take care
 struct: gn
 ZarthaxX: cya Astrobytes
 GodGooey: sick lag
 Jasperr: welcome to "that" time of the night at CG :D
 Rbee: excellent

 RyanGilbert: Is there a penalty for getting 0% on a clash
 TsakBoolhak: of course not
 RyanGilbert: ok thanks
 Mohamed_Kharrat: guys if we solve a puzzle 2 times with the same language does it count as 2 puzzles solved for that language or do we have to solve 2 separate puzzles for that
 TsakBoolhak: i think you have to solve differents puzzles
 Emmaplayz: shut up nerd
 RyanGilbert: fit your bio
 Emmaplayz: WHAT 
 Emmaplayz: ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 MadKnight: ban
 MadKnight: hihi Jasperr
 RyanGilbert: how do i see coc rank
 MadKnight: open your profile
 MadKnight: somewhere in there for sure
 RyanGilbert: lol
 MadKnight: oooh u needed rank and not points
 MadKnight: then it's like around leaderboards
 MadKnight: RyanGilbert
 MadKnight: compete -&gt; leaderboards
 nerdyglass: haiiii

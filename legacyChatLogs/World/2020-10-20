 ironspidey: hi
 MadKnight: hihi
 AnSeDra: hi:smiley:
 MadKnight: what are u solving&#160;?
 AnSeDra: Clash of Code
 MadKnight: why not bot programming&#160;?
 AnSeDra: I want to be able to be sure that I can do well under presure
 Marchete: 1bar is a good pressure
 sid12123: hi
 jacek: dang, this checkers engine cannot do looped jumps. this is what you get for porting some random engine from github
 linjoehan: ha I had the same error in the first version of that game.
 ZarthaxX: an icon that is to share the video
 Coder613: right then i found your profile but i cant figure out past that
 Coder613: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/494148189">https://www.codingame.com/replay/494148189</a>
 Coder613: I think I figured it out. Thanks so much ZarthaxX you were very helpful.
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: nice :P
 ZarthaxX: have fun!
 Coder613: thanks you too!
 dip10: Hii
 jacek: ohai
 sid12123: ohaiyo
 Marchete: jacek, do you have some stub code for your jacekmax?
 jacek: no :c
 jacek: it should be relatively easy to convert mcts into jacekmax
 justacoder: Does anyone know why the "angle" randomly jumps from +INT to -INT in Coders Strike Back?
 justacoder: -7, +2, -27, -28 is the data captured as I pass a point
 justacoder: The +2 seems out of step
 MSmits: I am guessing it's between -180 and +180&#160;?
 justacoder: Yeah. Normally.
 MSmits: don't remember exactly, but it should be easy to figure out. 
 MSmits: also the angle has nothing to do with your position
 MSmits: just the direction you're facing
 MSmits: so it doesnt matter that you pass a point
 MSmits: unless it's making you rotate
 justacoder: That is a good point, no pun intended. I will just track the angle to the next point manually.  Thank you. 
 MSmits: yeah thats possible too. np
 thanhhv317: hi
 magaiti: if the direction your pod is facing does not coincide with the direction of your velocity vector (which is generally the case in csb), then -7 +2 is a perfectly ordinary sequence of angles to a point
 magaiti: i presume -27 -28 are angles to the next point
 JoeFather: any real ppl?
 magaiti: im i a joke to you?
 magaiti: jk im totally imaginary
 jacek: Automaton2000 really?
 jacek:&#160;:(
 magaiti: omg hes ded
 magaiti: Automaton2000 where ar u
 magaiti: noooo
 jacek: just was dead for awhile
 MSmits: I can imitate Automaton2000 if you want
 MSmits: because the code is in the minimax to get you promoted
 MSmits: or I can do AutomatonNN
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl do you know how to code the python in the json?
 magaiti: Automaton69, just testing
 MadKnight: hey guys
 MadKnight: quick question on python
 MadKnight: so there's [x for x in arr]
 MadKnight: but what if i wanna put multiple values per x in arr&#160;?
 MadKnight: like[(x+1, x+3) for x in arr]
 MadKnight: how can i do that&#160;?
 Uljahn: :confused:
 MadKnight: Uljahn tell me
 MadKnight: u gotta know
 MadKnight: u 100% know it
 Cybgy: I think you have already did that
 Uljahn: ^
 MadKnight: that didn't work
 MadKnight: that made it an array of iterators
 Cybgy: any example 
 Uljahn: should be a list of tuples
 MadKnight: [(x0+1, x0+3), (x1+1, x1+3)]
 SPDene: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/979928b0-1710-4cdc-bb1b-2aeac6343d1e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/979928b0-1710-4cdc-bb1b-2aeac6343d1e</a>
 MadKnight: and i need[x0+1, x0+3, x1+1, x1+3] 
 Uljahn: so what's your arr?
 Cybgy: okay
 MadKnight: SPDene i need[2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 6]
 Uljahn: itertools.chain?
 MadKnight: no i have arr = [1, 2, 3]
 MadKnight: and i need to get [2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 6]
 Uljahn: try itertools.chain then
 MadKnight: isn't that something different&#160;?
 MadKnight: how do u suggest me to use itertools&#160;?
 MadKnight: chain
 Uljahn: ezpz
 MadKnight: u want me to turn it into 3 steps&#160;?
 SPDene: this might help <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27454390/how-to-flatten-a-list-of-tuples-into-a-pythonic-list">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27454390/how-to-flatten-a-list-of-tuples-into-a-pythonic-list</a>
 Cybgy: :joy:
 MadKnight: can't i avoid turning it into multiple steps like[1, 2, 3] -&gt; [(2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 6)] -&gt; [2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 6]&#160;?
 Cybgy: You did it #SPDene
 MadKnight: is there really no way to avoid the step with [()()()]&#160;?
 Cybgy: But still 3 steps
 Uljahn: np.array(arr).ravel() :thinking:
 MadKnight: that doesn't avoid the step
 Cybgy: [y for x in [(m+1,m+3) for m in arr] for y in x]
 Cybgy: it works
 SPDene: or [x+n for n in [1,3] for x in arr]
 SPDene: yeah&#160;: use [x+n for x in arr for n in [1,3]]
 Cybgy: the first sounds good
 Cybgy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/raw/VyYqC3iy">https://pastebin.com/raw/VyYqC3iy</a>
 MikeKlymenko: one who is not sharing code must be cheating for sure using copy-paste from web
 Cybgy:&#160;??
 MikeKlymenko: that was a general statement - agree of disagree
 MikeKlymenko: *or
 Cybgy: I disagree
 MikeKlymenko: why to hide?
 MikeKlymenko: I am talking about Clash of Code
 Cybgy: Sometimes it's better to solve it by yourself
 MikeKlymenko: problem solving
 SPDene: disagree... sometimes i just write terrible code, and don't want people to judge me on it
 MikeKlymenko: But you can't see until you have done
 Cybgy: :neutral_face:
 WINWINWIN: MikeKlymenko there are other reasons why some people don't share. One classic reason is that problems repeat, so they don't want other people to know their solution
 WINWINWIN: for example, in a shortest, if I find the best possible solution, I won't want others to know that solution
 DomiKo: in reverse too
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 MikeKlymenko: omg you consider it not like an educational tool but like real-life money competion. This is so lame
 Cybgy: Sometimes I felt the need of having an option to save puzzles, but then I realize that there is no need for that at the first place
 Astrobytes: If you want education then do puzzles not clashes
 MikeKlymenko: best solution to what? life saving problem?
 Cybgy: Well said
 Astrobytes: clashes are competitive, the clue is in the name
 MikeKlymenko: I do both
 Astrobytes: oh hey WINWINWIN o/
 MikeKlymenko: clashes for programming drills, puzzles for algorithms
 Cybgy: Clashes are like random tests
 MSmits: MikeKlymenko I also find it illuminating that if there was money to be won, you would consider it normal to be competitive, but as long as there is no money, all should be shared
 Astrobytes: Clashes are just for fun, if you want to get serious try bot programming
 Cybgy: you must research why you failed
 Astrobytes: good point MSmits
 MikeKlymenko: I like shares to see alternative to mine solutions, especially in different languages
 Cybgy: best way take a screenshot of the puzzle
 MSmits: MikeKlymenko many people do share. That doesn't mean all should, it's a personal choice, as it should be
 MSmits: in fact, in other parts of this site, you're not even allowed to share code
 Cybgy: if that's plausible than there won't be a need of having puzzles
 MSmits: so it's not that natural to do so
 MikeKlymenko: It makes sense to compete for limited tresources like money, but not in an educational problem
 MSmits: it makes sense to you
 MSmits: it makes sense to me to also be competitive in things that are just for fun
 Cybgy: Well it's there own right
 Cybgy: share or not
 Cybgy: But it's a good practice to do
 MSmits: I respect people who share indeed
 Cybgy: Yeah, we can't debate on this topic
 Cybgy: it's a choice 
 MikeKlymenko: fun to hide your solution instead of sharing it? it sounds like a psychological issue
 Cybgy: May be
 Cybgy: for some
 MSmits: MikeKlymenko if you understand competition at all, you know the fun is not in the hiding
 MSmits: it's finding the best ways to win
 MSmits: and winning
 Astrobytes: as SPDene said, sometimes people write atrocious code that they don't want to show, others want to stay competitive, others simply forget to share
 Astrobytes: The focus is on solving the task, not "oh I must share my code"
 MSmits: yeah the fun is also in the solving
 Cybgy: It's kind a rare code that we write sometimes
 Cybgy: which even we ourselves don't want to share 
 MSmits: there are so many ways to compete in games. do you think it's normal for everyone to share all their strategies openly. Or do you think it's normal for people to keep as much of their strategy hidden?
 MSmits: I think it's the second in most online competition
 MSmits: it only feels different for coding, because code is always so freely shared in other ways
 MSmits: like stack overflow and such
 MSmits: but it doesn't have to be
 Astrobytes: unless you're euler and give it away in chat halfway through the week :P
 Cybgy: lol
 MSmits: I do this too, often Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: ah yes, true
 MSmits: only most players will read my stuff and think, meh that sounds like too much work
 MikeKlymenko: Ok, I see, probably I have chosen the wrong place to drill coding if you play here in coding with a strategy
 MSmits: MikeKlymenko also realize you're talking on CG world chat
 MSmits: most of us dont even do clashes
 Astrobytes: I can't see how you would form that conclusion but... ok I guess
 MSmits: we compete in bot games with 1000 line programs
 MikeKlymenko: though I have studied plenty of stuff from others here
 Cybgy: Mike don't take it like that
 Uljahn: i guess CG is not really an educational platform, but a great opportunity to educate yourself through challenges
 MikeKlymenko: it would be a good motivation to attend such places, but no
 Astrobytes: You can learn a whole lot on here
 MSmits: Uljahn it's pretty educational though
 Cybgy: Your wish Mike
 MikeKlymenko: yes I agree I had learned indeed
 MSmits: it just isn't mandatory to teach others
 Astrobytes: No Uljahn described it well I think
 MSmits: and thats fine
 MikeKlymenko: This just annihilate the idea of this place
 MSmits: you're overstating it 
 Cybgy: This place is about bot fights 
 MSmits: mostly yeah
 Astrobytes: (and puzzles, some only do puzzles)
 Cybgy: Which makes it beautiful 
 Cybgy: Others sites have only words
 MSmits: if people shared their bot code it would completely ruin any leaderboard
 Cybgy: lol
 MSmits: instead people share ideas
 Cybgy: I can't dream of that even
 MSmits: about strategy
 MikeKlymenko: I prefer to do puzzels on othe rsites, I am here only for speeding up codin gin certaing languages by momorizing idioms
 MSmits: and it's up to you to code it
 Astrobytes: Not sure if clashes are the way to do that, people usually write fast and dirty solutions
 MikeKlymenko: I appreciate the idioms I have studied in Clashes
 Cybgy: Idioms, oh yeah i got that
 MikeKlymenko: That is what I call idioms
 MSmits: MikeKlymenko do you honestly find yourself hampered in learning because some dont share? I did maybe 50 clashes for the quests and I found a lot of people that shared and taught me a lot
 MikeKlymenko: fast and dirty and short
 Astrobytes: I don't see how golfing applies to real world problems
 Cybgy: Well it does
 Astrobytes: (for the most part)
 MSmits: ask Trump
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Cybgy: visit NASA
 Cybgy: Astro
 Astrobytes: Yeah sure
 Cybgy: :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: But that's also about efficiency, not just writing cryptic one liners
 Cybgy: lol MSmits
 MikeKlymenko: I have realized that C++, C and  sometimes Python guys are usaully keen on sharing, while Java and ruby people are hiding for some reasons
 Cybgy: That's how you saw that
 MSmits: ruby is almost a specialized clash language because it's usually the shortest
 MSmits: people who use ruby probably try to be very competitive
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: dunno about java
 Cybgy: Ahhhhhh, ruby
 Cybgy: they chokes my python 
 MSmits: I only tried python anyway , thats the language i learned some stuff for  in clashes
 MSmits: i dont even look at ruby code
 MikeKlymenko: me too
 MikeKlymenko: I am curious though they are doing it fast
 Einwickler: People who dont share their solutions when winning are a real problem for this community&#160;:(
 MSmits: MikeKlymenko i recommend you look at some bot arenas if you feel like it, then you will get the real idea of Codingame
 Cybgy: Again 
 Cybgy: @Einwickler
 MSmits: clashes are just fluff imho
 MikeKlymenko: alright thanks
 Cybgy: have a good day
 Einwickler: Cybgby&#160;? :thinking:
 Cybgy:&#160;??
 MSmits: hey Astrobytes, I got 10 seed db to work in Oware, usually done generating on the 40th ply or so. But my bot does way better when i stop at 9
 MSmits: because of cache efficiency and the fact that i can spend more time searching
 Astrobytes: ah so it wasn't really worth going further after all
 Einwickler: you wrote "again" and then "@Einwickler" dont really get what to do with that :D
 MSmits: 9 was already an improvement, because i had 8 before, and needed 40 plies to get the 9 finished. The cache change thingy basically got me an extra seed
 Astrobytes: Einwickler: I think he was referring to the fact you were echoing the sentiments expressed by Mike in previous messages
 MSmits: gonna look at doing it offline soon. See if i can make my meta mcts better with a 20-24 db (realistically)
 Astrobytes: Something tells me it should help
 MSmits: probably, if only to make the rollouts shorter
 MSmits: but i guess also more accurate
 Astrobytes: Yes, more accurate
 MSmits: I think maybe I should try jacekmax first
 MSmits: it seems so easy
 MSmits: did you try it Astrobytes&#160;?
 MSmits: I think it will take you an hour at most
 Astrobytes: was just gonna say, it seems trivial to implement. No not yet, but I plan to at some point
 MSmits: ah ok. I am afraid that my eval is not suitable for it, then i try it and it wont be better
 MSmits: not looking forward to refitting everything just to come to the conclusion its not better
 Astrobytes: This is something to be aware of, considering how much effort jacek went to for his evals
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: my bot has one advantage over jacek
 MSmits: it's much faster and searches deeper
 MSmits: so the eval can be worse
 MSmits: but still
 Astrobytes: it's a tradeoff yeah, but whether it's a good one remains to be seen
 MSmits: I am making assumptions here, but it's pretty safe to assume a NN eval is extremely slow
 Astrobytes: doesn't have to be fast if it's good enough, that tradeoff again
 MSmits: yeah

 jacek: yhm
 Shadowtick: meem
 Shadowtick: morning everyone
 jacek: morning eh?
 kiil-code: hi
 kiil-code: #killcodeownchat
 Shadowtick: I am getting triggered at myself because I can't make the song I want to make
 kiil-code: why not
 Shadowtick: I don't know why probably because I can't find out a good rhythm or tempo
 kiil-code: oh 
 Astrobytes: try 11/8 @ 200 bpm
 Shadowtick: yeah but if you wanna hear how it is rn then I can send you the link kiil-code
 kiil-code: ok
 MSmits: mmh my jacekmax seems  to run bug free, but its bad. I am suspecting a minussign somewhere :P
 ZarthaxX: what is a jacekmax? :P
 MSmits: it's uct guided minimax
 eulerscheZahl: the response to hte superiority of GAimax
 kiil-code: dang
 ZarthaxX: GAimax?
 ZarthaxX: MSmits wait, it's a minmax guided like mcts?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-28">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-28</a>
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash: it's negamax
 MSmits: yes ZarthaxX it's very close to what i do with early play out termination
 ZarthaxX: so it determines the order in which it explores the childs?
 MSmits: where i backpropagate an eval
 ZarthaxX: mhmm
 kiil-code: ya
 ZarthaxX: but it's actually building a tree in memory?
 ZarthaxX: not just a dfs minmax
 MSmits: the only difference is that instead of adding up all the evals and calculating the average, it keeps taking the minimax value
 MSmits: its building a tree yes
 kiil-code: ya
 MSmits: and using the eval for UCT
 MSmits: instead of wins/visits
 jacek: its like mcts, but you eval instead of simulation and you overwrite in negamax style
 ZarthaxX: so it's like your mcts solver part?
 ZarthaxX: okey
 kiil-code: sure
 MSmits: it's very similar, it took me 10 mins to rewrite
 ZarthaxX: and how does it work?
 Astrobytes: it goes brrrrrr
 MSmits: well you prefer nodes that have a better score, like mcts
 MSmits: and you balance exploration with exploitation
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes sometimes i wonder how you got mod :rofl:
 jacek: or mk
 Astrobytes: me too :D
 jacek: almost I got mod
 eulerscheZahl: but you refused
 ZarthaxX: MSmits yes that'e theorical
 jacek: im responsible
 ZarthaxX: i just wanted to know practice wise :P
 MSmits: you mean how well does it work
 Astrobytes: I'm actually really helpful most of the time
 MSmits: ah
 eulerscheZahl: responsible enough to refuse
 MSmits: well its undecided
 MSmits: since jacek combines it with a NN
 ZarthaxX: oh hell
 jacek: it works better for me. vs normal negamax i get 70%+ winrate
 MSmits: but that shouldnt matter all that much
 jacek: which is alpha beta + iterativ deepening. nothing fancy
 ZarthaxX: many users using ML nowdays
 MSmits: my EPT also gets that much of a winrate against any of my negamaxes 
 Astrobytes: yeah that's why I switched from negamax to ept in oware back then
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: and what is ept
 MSmits: mcts with eval instead of simulation
 Astrobytes: early playout termination
 MSmits: so instead of -1.0,1 you get an eval
 ZarthaxX: ah well so it has a name
 MSmits: often there is also a simulation, but its short
 ZarthaxX: early player termination ept?
 MSmits: ours is 0 length
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: playout
 ZarthaxX: i see
 MSmits: so you dont play the game out all the way
 ZarthaxX: it's necessary in these games hinestly
 MSmits: it is
 kiil-code: ya
 MSmits: the ept thing really does remove any advantage minimax has over mcts i think
 ZarthaxX: mmmm
 MSmits: because you got an eval
 MSmits: well 1 thing maybe
 MSmits: minimax is better at TT
 ZarthaxX: it still doesnt explore the tree entirely up to one point
 ZarthaxX: so maybe you still lose on smth
 jacek: int c = i&#160;% i; how the hell it didnt crash?
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 MSmits: it just balance depth and width of the tree is all
 MSmits: like mcts
 MSmits: how you balance that is a parameter
 anjaniacatus: hello
 MSmits: (exploration)
 ZarthaxX: i was talking solely about mcts with the ept
 ZarthaxX: not the jacekmax thingy
 anjaniacatus: :confused:
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: they are really almost the same
 ZarthaxX: hi anjaniacatus
 ZarthaxX: mmm
 MSmits: btw, i even kept in my mcts solver
 MSmits: i didnt use the eval to solve
 MSmits: because how would you know it's a draw?
 jacek: well mcts is meh for trappy games but NN can mitigate that
 ZarthaxX: i think it's way different to not gather statistics and do a minmax instead
 ZarthaxX: but well
 MSmits: i mean
 MSmits: ept is similar to jacekmax
 MSmits: they both gather statistics
 MSmits: its just what they do with the eval exactly is different, but the difference is maybe 10 lines of code
 jacek: i think they could be equivalent given appriopately tuned exploration
 ZarthaxX: but you backpropagate diff stuff
 MSmits: they could be, but the parameters will be different
 MSmits: yea ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: one is acummulating and the other minmaxing 
 ZarthaxX: i would get to think that it changes
 ZarthaxX: but well
 MSmits: exactly, but accumulating also leads to some form of minimax
 MSmits: it;s just more fuzzy
 jacek: that would be handy, if mcts will find refutation its gonna take some time to statistics to be more significant. in minimax it is already done
 MSmits: i think maybe oware likes the fuzzy because evaling it is not that easy
 MSmits: yeah thats the thing with minimax, it's immediately done, mcts leaves a bit more room for error
 MSmits: it averages out
 MSmits: both have advantages
 ZarthaxX: MSmits i see
 MSmits: i honestly dont know which way is better
 MSmits: and i bet it depends on the game as well
 kiil-code: hi
 MSmits: its too bad jacek does his NN thing, but if he did not, there would be another issue
 MSmits: i tend to have very fast sims
 MSmits: so also unfair comparison
 MSmits: maybe if i can really do this jacekmax well we can have an idea which is better, but i need to do a lot of work fitting params =/
 jacek: yay for the nonlinearity of eval
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: so do you think i should just use an arena, add your +- 0.2 randomness on moves and fit vs myself jacek?&gt;
 MSmits: been using cg bench before, just picking 5 opponents
 jacek: you could try. i dont know you optimized your params
 jacek: how
 MSmits: i did self play first in oware, that was bad
 MSmits: but i did not do the +- thing
 MSmits: i think self play works for a ballpark value
 MSmits: at least
 MSmits: submitted a version, we'll see what it does
 MSmits: i think maybe rank 15 or so
 MSmits: o it beat royale 
 MSmits: twice, 11 wins in a row
 MSmits: getting some losses it's not supposed to though, tric trac and renard
 MSmits: so not bad at first
 MSmits: but needs improvement

 Astrobytes: stop it kiil-code
 kiil-code: what
 kiil-code: did i do
 eulerscheZahl: i always see repeated sharing of a contribution as a challenge to downvote
 Astrobytes: kiil-code: 1. this is World chat, English only.2. telling him not to listen to us
 kiil-code: oooooh 
 kiil-code: im scared 
 DejaVu_081: hey hey... please stop. My fold

 DejaVu_081: 👍🏻
 GGgugge360: The noob just made Mars langing 1
 GGgugge360: Landing' srry for my trash typing
 Astrobytes: well done
 GGgugge360: Thanks Astobytes
 GGgugge360: Trying hard
 GGgugge360: and it seem to work
 GGgugge360: BTW have you done "Power of thor - Episode 1"?
 Astrobytes: yup
 GGgugge360: i can show my code
 GGgugge360: I actually just used cords
 Astrobytes: First: make sure you update thor's position and don't just output the directions
 eulerscheZahl: do you update thor's position? missing that is a common problem
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 GGgugge360: I made around that XD
 eulerscheZahl: ok, share the code
 GGgugge360: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b60c5043-9326-4c19-851d-4981f59b29c4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b60c5043-9326-4c19-851d-4981f59b29c4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: pastebins are back \o/
 GGgugge360: remember to change the player to thorX and thorY
 eulerscheZahl: and you are hardcoding
 Astrobytes: ^
 GGgugge360: kind of
 Astrobytes: that will not work at all
 GGgugge360: Gave up on algorythms
 GGgugge360: ooh
 GGgugge360: u didnt change the player to thorX and thorY
 eulerscheZahl: if (initialTY &gt; lightY) {System.out.print("N"); initialTY--;}
 eulerscheZahl: should be something like this
 GGgugge360: ik ik
 Astrobytes: Think about where thor is in relation to the light, and adjust thor accordinly
 Astrobytes: *accordingly
 GGgugge360: i juast changed the "initialT" to "thor"
 GGgugge360: including the X and Y
 GGgugge360: ill scan of my whole code for ya
 kill-code: hi
 GGgugge360: here
 Astrobytes: look at what euler wrote GGgugge360
 GGgugge360: delete everything and use this whole script

 kill-code: hi
 GGgugge360: hi there
 kill-code: wyd
 GGgugge360: The GG noob is checking in
 eulerscheZahl: Thor has some more hidden testcases that you can't even see

 GGgugge360: i copied from start to end
 kill-code: me
 GGgugge360: if you want
 kill-code: nice
 GGgugge360: did it work?
 kill-code: no it pulled me up to a blank screen
 GGgugge360:&#160;:/
 GGgugge360: It worked for me..
 GGgugge360: euler did it work for you?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't try it
 eulerscheZahl: i have a working solution already
 kill-code: cool
 GGgugge360: :dissapointed:
 GGgugge360: :disappointed:
 GGgugge360: (bad typing i know)
 eulerscheZahl: i already gave you some code how to solve it
 GGgugge360: want to see my mars lander :worried:
 eulerscheZahl: just do the same for the other directions
 eulerscheZahl: while (true) {System.out.println("03\n04");}
 Astrobytes: no we don't want to see your Mars Lander code
 kill-code: why be mean 
 GGgugge360: it's ok
 GGgugge360: im still a nooby anyways
 jacek: want to see my python?
 jacek: :v
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 GGgugge360:&#160;?

 GGgugge360: go on ur phone and go to a weather site :upside_down:
 GGgugge360: then

 magaiti: this is the weather code
 kill-code: oh
 Astrobytes: man, I've seen that xkcd twice this month
 Astrobytes: still funny
 eulerscheZahl: i think i only shared this xkcd once this month
 GGgugge360: hmm..
 kill-code: "omg still laughing"
 GGgugge360: idk
 GGgugge360: download Desktop goose, the perfect programming partner
 GGgugge360: bye
 magaiti: oh yeah good old rubber duck programming
 kill-code: wait where are you going
 kill-code: ooof
 kill-code: hi
 kill-code: bye
 AntiSquid: fascinating monologue
 kill-code: oh
 mo-qam: peepee
 kill-code: nice
 kill-code: bye
 ParticleBeam: Hmm. Can't get the last entry 15 for the weekly puzzle when submitting.
 ParticleBeam: Ah. Was a bug. Nvm.
 jacek: glad to be helpful
 DomiKo: that moment when you found bug in UTTT after like a week...
 Astrobytes: don't be silly, there are no bugs in your code. It's the puzzle and/or the leaderboard! :P
 Zenoscave: Astro you sound like a level 3
 Zenoscave: did you find a bug in Thor too?
 jacek: AutomatonNN how many bugs are in your code?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a solution for the contest though xD
 jacek: xD
 Zenoscave: That sounded like a true Ceg answer
 Astrobytes: Thor is bugged Zenoscave! They're all bugged!
 Zenoscave: lol
 DomiKo: AutomatonNN  XDDD
 AutomatonNN: if next_checkpoint is the problem
 Astrobytes: how's it going anyway? Heard you did well in the CTF(s)
 Zenoscave: I did decent for only being present for the first half lol
 Astrobytes: hey, quality not quantity right
 Zenoscave: true
 Zenoscave: Gah I am stuck with Coif. I'm so close to legend
 Astrobytes: I tried to pick some low hanging fruit but didn't come up with much, too lazy to rewrite my contest code :P
 Zenoscave: I might need to
 Astrobytes: Nerchio wrote some stuff in his PM for the unofficial "contest", donno if it's any use for you
 Zenoscave: link?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/debriefing-winterthrone2020-code-of-ice-and-fire/186956">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/debriefing-winterthrone2020-code-of-ice-and-fire/186956</a>
 Astrobytes: hm, still only one PM lol, at least it's a legend one
 Zenoscave: Yeah I had most of that except the banking
 MACKEYTH: I'm working on Chess board analyzer
 MACKEYTH: Anyone know if King capturing a piece is considered a valid move?
 Zenoscave: In chess in general?
 MACKEYTH: I know it is in general, but I mean in this specific problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MACKEYTH it's valid, but most are protected
 MACKEYTH: Thanks!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MACKEYTH stomping on your own pieces was a case that i had problems with, dumb me
 MACKEYTH: Oh, hadn't thought of that. Illegal?
 MACKEYTH: I assume so
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, of course
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the bishop testcase is a good one to test that, I kept stomping on my own pawn...dumb me
 MACKEYTH: No, I can see how you missed it. My initial concept was to map all the checked squares.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did that at first too, then i realized king could move on same rank/file as a rook and still be in check
 DeeDub: ansible
 Allis: I just try all nine moves for the King and it's checkmate if all of them leave the King in check.
 Allis: The one that initially tripped me up was to do with how I had implemented "vision" for Rooks and Bishops; they can't see "past" the King, but that doesn't mean the King can move into the square they can't see.
 Allis: Because, well, after the King moves there, they can see it.
 257832: Hi there&#160;!
 Majeck: How can I find the puzzle of the week but not from notifications?
 Majeck: I have the link I just mean in general
 Allis: @Majeck That seems to be the only way, unfortunately. You can search the puzzle name if you happen to remember it, but otherwise you have to dig through old notifications.
 Majeck: Oh ok, thanks Allis!
 L810: please help me lol
 XTXMidnightXTX: L810 what's ya problem?
 L810: idk where to even start
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye. shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: 8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh. findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
 L810: so on dont panic episode 1... idk where to start
 Majeck: If this is your first time on the site I'd recommend an even easier puzzle to get the hang of it
 Majeck: Power of Thor for example
 Majeck: Or "The Descent" if you want to practice loops
 Majeck: In any case if you still want to have a go at Don't Panic Episode 1 I'd recommend first reading and completely understanding the statement, then looking at the pre-built code (for input handling) and also understanding it
 Majeck: Play a few test cases with the default code to see what happens and what you need to do
 Majeck: And then instead of just directly coding the solution, first, try solving it in paper
 KiwiTae: L810 Dont panic is fun :D 
 Majeck: What I usually do for medium and up puzzles is draw the problem on paper, come up with a human solution pretty quickly (in don't panic it's where to stop the bots) and then see how I can adapt and translate that solution to code
 YUHBOI: hello
 KiwiTae: hi o/
 Majeck: Hey KiwiTae do you plan on streaming for the fall contest?
 KiwiTae: &gt;,&lt; there is a contest coming up? hehe 
 Majeck: Yep, in 22 days, 12 hours and 43 minutes

 KiwiTae: hoho i might join, but prob not much into it, im moving to europe early december, got to wrap up stuf in my office :scream:

 Majeck: Nah, although I will ask some friend to come over and play
 Majeck: *friends
 Majeck: We've been pretty secure with quarantine so no risks there
 Majeck: Last time we programmed for a contest together was when COIF came out and it was really fun
 KiwiTae: oh right you guys have covid pandemic 
 Majeck: And you don't?
 KiwiTae: no, no infections in taiwan :p
 KiwiTae: we place everyone in forced quarantine when they land on the island

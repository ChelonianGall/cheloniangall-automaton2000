 cobunny: Hi guys, how to play?
 cobunny: :nerd:
 FlyHead: how to play what
 baguettes: :nerd:
 benjumea: Hello
 Saad-py: Hi Mate
 blackjune: Hello guys
 Saad-py: HIiiiii
 Fiolinio: hi gamers
 Saad-py: Wasssup Programmers
 Fiolinio: i'm having fun
 Adm-Beck: Anyone knows how to turn off this chat? It just appeared and takes a lot of screen real estate 
 Saad-py: ok
 Saad-py: bottom play button
 baguettes: There will be an arrow in the bottom left of the chat
 baguettes: Press that, and the chat should tuck in to the right of your screen
 Kokoz: hello all&#160;:)
 baguettes: What would be the stub generator for iterating over a string with no space separated characters
 baguettes:&#160;?
 Theino: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63618707a685d8557571cabb82f9ed5b28d9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/63618707a685d8557571cabb82f9ed5b28d9</a>
 Theino: I'm just going to leave this here so people can upvote me and I can get that sweet sweet XP
 Theino: also so people can review the work and to help the site grow or whatever... but mainly XP!
 baguettes: A question
 baguettes: How do I make an output of a testcase be blank
 baguettes:&#160;?
 baguettes: Because it always errors saying the field is empty
 baguettes: Do I have to put in a special unicode?
 baguettes: Help? :D
 rubber_duckie: do you mean a single newline? like in python, an empty print() statement?
 tutubalin: baguettes i think, the problem is the other way around: test expects some output, but your code outputs nothing
 tutubalin: or vice versa: it outputs too much, so when test expects nothing, your code still output something
 baguettes: yeah the same thing @rubber_duckie
 Uljahn: something like \n&#160;?
 tutubalin: ah, got it. you're MAKING puzzle, not SOLVING it. sorry, my bad
 baguettes: tutubalin, I think you understood it wrong, I mean when I try to test my WIP contrib, it gives an error saying test no. x is empty
 baguettes: oh lol, yeah
 baguettes: Yes, Uljahn
 tutubalin: ok, i would highly discourage from making testcase with blank output.better use something like 'IMPOSSIBLE' or 'NO SOLUTIONS'
 awnion: same, or just -1
 baguettes: Hmm, thanks, I'll do that!
 baguettes: Done!
 baguettes: I'll just post the link to the contribution

 xcxcx: idk
 Uljahn: the chat is in energy saving mode to lower greenhouse gases emission
 baguettes: :pp

 tutubalin: today is International Dead Chat Day
 baguettes: Lol
 GeorgiD: Hello there, I am a string. -&gt; 13Can you figure out the solution to this puzzle? -&gt; 23
 GeorgiD: What is the logic?
 GeorgiD: I tried number of vowels and non vowels
 GeorgiD: You can do it! I believe in you! -&gt; 16 is another example
 baguettes: We need more than 1
 baguettes: test case
 baguettes: GeorgiD It's the length of the string / 2
 GeorgiD: Oh thank you
 baguettes: No problem :D

 Wontonimo: looks like kinda went off the rails
 Wontonimo: How's it going Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The schoolkids were kicked, and received a talking to in PM
 Astrobytes: Not too bad Wontonimo, yourself?
 Wontonimo: it's wednesday my dude, which means tomorrow is Prefriday, followed by Friday.  That's how i'm holding it together 
 Astrobytes: Hah! You know it :D
 baguettes: I'm leaving a link to my contribution

 baguettes: Check it out if you'd like to
 Astrobytes: Don't do clashes so I'll leave it for someone else&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Looks pretty fun though
 Joseph_Mother:  My Journey to the Starts
 jacek: Astrobytes have you checked out nine men morris?
 Astrobytes: Not yet jacek, you?
 jacek: i thought it was weird no one tried it. then i saw everyone had bots on 2nd league
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: It's solved as a draw iirc but is it interesting enough with CG constraints?
 jacek: lets ask msmits for meta
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Naturally!
 baguettes: Nine men morris?
 baguettes: The board game?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 baguettes: oO

 NeoCipher: Hey guys I am a little new can someone tell me how to increase my "codinpoints"?? 
 NeoCipher: I did a few Clash of Code thingys but its still the same
 NeoCipher: neither increasing or decreasing
 Astrobytes: The points are updated every day, so you need to wait til tomorrow to see the difference NeoCipher
 darkhorse64: CP are updated once a day
 NeoCipher: Ahh okk thankss
 NeoCipher: so much
 Astrobytes: Also, the clash CPs decay over time. You can get CPs from moving up leagues in multiplayer games or such though.
 darkhorse64: Fair advice, if you only play CoC, you miss the best part of CG
 Astrobytes: In our completely unbiased opinion.
 JLukeSkywalker: i agree too
 darkhorse64: totally unbiased
 NeoCipher: and where are these multiplayer game??
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 NeoCipher: I mean you guys seem experienced so I am gonna try it obviously
 Astrobytes: From ACtivities-&gt;Compete menu at the top btw
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer: unbiased
 NeoCipher: Got it thankyou guys again
 Astrobytes: no worries
 NeoCipher: I am still learning so anything to help me grow a bit works
 Wontonimo: NeoCipher the most popular (and arguably the easiest to get started in) is Coders Strikes Back <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a> , but if you are looking for something smaller
 Astrobytes: You (hopefully) never stop learning NeoCipher
 NeoCipher: True
 NeoCipher: Thanks Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: there is a smaller practice called Mars Lander that I really like to suggest <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 Wontonimo: which has a couple more episodes and an optimization challenge
 NeoCipher: Got it have them all opened will go through all of them once
 NeoCipher: :thumbsup:
 darkhorse64: Don't forget to turn off the sound for Mars Lander
 Astrobytes: ^
 darkhorse64: Even if you forget, you will turn it off anyway
 Astrobytes: Hm. Let the record show that I Am An Idiot. Stupid bitboarding.
 Astrobytes: Had my shifts the wrong way round.
 darkhorse64: For which multi
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Clobber. Finally got around to it.
 jacek: you want some masks to not get around it
 Astrobytes: Well, finally getting around to it.
 Astrobytes: Been very lazy recently.
 darkhorse64: Been busy with Fireworks. Some people are trying to steal my #1
 Astrobytes: Outrageous. How could they!
 darkhorse64: Yeah, it's mine. What's the point in submitting&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 darkhorse64: It's a funny coop game with lots of RPS. If coop is bad, you easily take last place even against weak players
 Astrobytes: I only have half a bot written for it currently.
 NeoCipher: You guys have a crazy profile 
 NeoCipher: So many languages&#160;!!!!
 NeoCipher: :cold_sweat:
 NeoCipher: How long have you guys been coding for&#160;??
 Astrobytes: Some of those are just to get language achievements, it doesn't mean we're experts in them all&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: There are languages achievements. Solve 1,3,7,15 puzzles in a specific language
 Wontonimo: ^ yeah what Astrobytes said
 NeoCipher: Still the fact that you did them means you know something
 Wontonimo: I got my by hacking and running the tests a lot
 NeoCipher: How long have you guys been coding for&#160;??
 Astrobytes: Either not long enough or too long. Not sure.
 Wontonimo: i started when i was 8.  been coding professionally for 27 years
 NeoCipher: Waittt what the hell 8??
 NeoCipher: Woww you guys are crazy good
 darkhorse64: The good thing is you get a minimal experience with new stuff and you get to know why you stiick with your favorite weapon. But some of them are worth giving a serious try
 Tuo: pls others in fireworks top10 run some code so i get #1 spot back&#160;:)
 Tuo: i think(hope) my new bot plays very well vs other good bots
 darkhorse64: Resistance is futile
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 darkhorse64: Solid 0.19 lead
 Astrobytes: Wow. Blazing ahead there :P
 Tuo: + a game where someone else runs code and your score changes up to +- 0.5 points 
 darkhorse64: leRenard to the rescue
 Tuo: btw there should proply be more tests for a game like this. its very hard to tell if new code is better by looking at the score
 darkhorse64: Yeah, probably not enough games. The final result depends very much on the deck ordering
 awnion: why comments has no MarkDown support?
 awnion: why comments have no MarkDown support?
 Wontonimo: AutomatonNN , why is there no markdown in comments?
 AutomatonNN: why not as hell
 Passifi: Giving people negative feedback is mean and might scar them for life that's why
 Wontonimo: sheesh, i don't need markdown to scar people, but i supposed it could help
 awnion: Constructive negative feedback is the only feedback that adds value IMHO
 awnion: what's the point in saying "oh you are so good and bla bla bla buy my shampoo&#160;:) "
 Astrobytes: With the odd exception now and then I believe most of the negative feedback is pretty constructive.The positive feedback can be a bit... vague?
 awnion: non-constructive hate speech is bad too of course
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you have to be very thoughtful and clever to be able to give positive negative feedback
 darkhorse64: It never hurts to tell someone he/she has done a good job. A pat in the back always conforts you
 UnnamedCodinGamer: few people are
 Passifi: Making progress ain't worth the risk of hurting someone's feeling&#160;:)
 awnion: to improve you HAVE to see negative sides: knowing positive sides adds not much because they are already good 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the art is to express it in a way that is helpful to the other side
 Passifi: btw I agree negative feedback is the best feedback there is I think the problem with marking down (in all seriousness) might be that people get stuck on the negative emtional side something that can be avoided if the feedback is actually written out and well formulated
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and not hurtful
 Astrobytes: Also, a lot of feedback is more neutral tbh, with suggestions for improvements and such. Without which, come publishing time, there would be cause for negative feedback.
 awnion: art is a bloody mess: but it worth sacrifice because the reward is an aesthetic joy
 Astrobytes: Very profound&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and in this specific case you have done something good
 awnion: I've learned it too late...
 Passifi: and truth be told better to be hurt and know you suck then to believe your great and then face the truth later on. Some people can't recover from their (unwarranted) illusions of grandeur
 Astrobytes: ^ 10000000%
 Wontonimo: I take offence, my grandeur isn't an illusion
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Passifi yes, I have seen people floating like balloons. It is nevertheless better to deflate them without bursting them 
 awnion: That's why I hate the western mindset: -- oh your work is so nice so cute amazing bla bla bla -- will you buy it? -- You know, today I'm busy maybe next year?&#160;:)&#160;:)
 awnion: familiar?
 Passifi: I don't know avoiding open criticism can be a pretty eastern thing too
 Astrobytes: UnnamedCodinGamer: Very true. No need to be hurtful needlessly.
 awnion: Welcome to Russia&#160;:) Here everyone can destroy your self-esteem to the bottom&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Definitely a more prevalent thing in the Western psyche though I'd argue.
 Astrobytes: awnion :D
 Astrobytes: It's like rewarding all the kids in the race, even when they didn't win...
 Passifi: When I studied Go my teachers were ruthless in pointing out my inadequacies it was part of the scene so I guess in terms of teaching the east is  a bit more agressive ^^ 
 Astrobytes: Aggressive perhaps, more realistic also perhaps
 Wontonimo: okay, participation rewards .... and how do you feel about getting XP or CP here on CG if you didn't come in #1&#160;?
 Wontonimo: or upvotes on stackoverflow or reddit when you arn't the lead contribution?
 awnion:  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance :P
 Passifi: In the end its an individual thing I believe a good teacher would have to know when to hurt and how to pick you up afterwards which isn't easy thats why good teachers are real regardless of the cultural context
 UnnamedCodinGamer: very rare indeed
 Astrobytes: No - not that kind of thing. I mean a certificate of participation etc is fine. It's when you see situations where everyone is made to feel like a 'winner' in competition - that's not right. It sends the wrong message.
 awnion: and experience in general only helps to get to the acceptance phase quickly&#160;:)
 Passifi: I think the problem is with rewarding them equally, not with rewarding them at all, no one minds a silver medal&#160;;)
 Passifi: or bronze 
 Wontonimo: i prefer the booze prize over bronze
 Astrobytes: Yes. If you demean the positives of striving to the top by rewarding those who came in last, you end up with people who feel somewhat entitled whether they try or not.
 Astrobytes: lol Wontonimo
 awnion: My point was being dangerous by being component is better than being harmless. Because if you dangerous you can act like harmless, but I'm not sure about opposite. 
 awnion: But to be dangerous you have to accept the fight, many fights. And you don't want to fight soft ppl. Pointless...  
 Astrobytes: Food for thought.OK, I'm afk for a bit, be back later
 Uljahn: the real participation reward is the friends we make along the way :hugging:
 derjack: :scream:
 KiwiTae: finisher medals are nice thou
 derjack: participation medals plx
 KiwiTae: submit default code is not worth anythin
 riririgp: Is there a playground? Any one suggest me a path finder to find it?:thinking:

 Tetra_2021: name all your variables very clearly - overly clearly if you have to
 WarDingo: Comments. When you look at your own code months later it may look like alien script.
 KelvinAndHubbles: just code, you'll learn evauntally
 UncleHenry: Thxs for the tips
 Wilster: -=W=-
 Tomix1337: why codingame is so frustrating? Code Wars has much more clear instructions
 oddoneout: code wars didnt have the automation games last time i checked
 oddoneout: not really comparable
 Tomix1337: what do you mean by automation games?
 oddoneout: compete &gt; bot programming
 Tomix1337: I'll look into it
 Tomix1337: thanks :grinning:
 oddoneout: np, these are the most fun to me
 Tomix1337: do they require a lot of skill from the programmer?
 Tomix1337: I mean, are they ok for the newbie?
 Tomix1337: a newbie*
 oddoneout: not really, I'm learning a lot about the algorithms on the fly
 Astrobytes: Perhaps. You need some basic language knowledge though.
 oddoneout: and some of them really hold your hand through the first 'levels'
 Tomix1337: sounds promising, will give codingame a second shot then
 Tomix1337: and what about "Learn" tab? Do people use it? Seems like a bunch of random topics 
 Astrobytes: Also, Tomix1337: what do you find unclear in the instructions?
 Tomix1337: I tried the first game with the spaceship (descendce)
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about 'Learn' tab for now, it's a semi-separate site with articles on just about everything people want to put on there.
 Astrobytes: Tomix1337: what confused you about it?
 oddoneout: I have never even been there lol
 Tomix1337: The "game loop" in this exercise wasn't a real game loop. Every iteration moved the spaceship from one side of the screen to another
 Astrobytes: Oh actually, I say 'don't worry about the Learn tab'...Tomix1337: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55547/how-to-get-started-on-codingame">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55547/how-to-get-started-on-codingame</a>
 Tomix1337: I figured out the flow with the help of cerr and debug console 
 Tomix1337: but there were a statement while(1) in c++ which means loop never ends
 Astrobytes: Check the link.
 Tomix1337: but in reality, there was a terminating statement. It was just not visible to the user
 Tomix1337: I'll definitely check it 
 Tomix1337: thanks a lot for your time ^_^
 Wilster: goto 1
 oddoneout: on error resume next
 oddoneout: i hate vba so much
 Astrobytes: Your program is run once for every testcase, the while loop confuses a lot of people to begin with. It only runs while there is input with required output.
 TenOldMen: why do I have a "1" next to my home symbol still 
 TenOldMen: I clicked on it and its still there
 Astrobytes: Sounds like a notification?
 Astrobytes: Something on the quest map you haven't clicked on?
 TenOldMen: Im pretty sure I clicked on everything already haha
 oddoneout: same here, everything on the quest map clicked as far as I can tell
 oddoneout: and I also have the (1)
 TenOldMen: unless there is a hidden one somewhere 
 Astrobytes: Hm. Can't reproduce on my end.
 oddoneout: could be related just to the newer accounts
 Astrobytes: Right, go around that quest map and click on everything dammit!
 Astrobytes: Contest signup maybe?
 Astrobytes: Just guessing, it's the first I've heard of it today
 oddoneout: I did sign up yesterday
 oddoneout: I'm not sure if the issue was there before or not
 oddoneout: It doesn't really bother me, but it did make me scan through the quest map a few times :D
 Jstn123: hi
 oddoneout: hullo
 TenOldMen: it's a problem is you have OCD haha
 Astrobytes: As the fellow in your profile picture may have said: Hah!
 Wontonimo: y, y u work so well evolution w/ pop 2 and no crossover?  u no supposed 2 work!
 Wontonimo: having done a thesis in artificial evolution, i have come to the conclusion that its just "built different" on CG 
 Astrobytes: CG constraints
 Astrobytes: On CG evolutionary generally only means basic RHEA
 MSmits: The moon or the titan?
 struct: How is the new cpu MSmits?
 MSmits: ridiculous
 MSmits: it says 36% usage and i am running 5 meta mcts at once
 struct: Nice, it also should be faster right?
 MSmits: I lowered turn time on some of the games
 struct: or is the base clock slower
 MSmits: because it was eating up the object pool
 struct: Why not increase pool size instead?
 struct: Would it affect in cg?
 MSmits: could have enlarged the pool, but why bother, it's supposed to be similar to how it runs in CG
 MSmits: in CG it does not manage to eat the pool
 MSmits: i try to have similar performance  in CG and local so it's representative
 MSmits: doesnt have to be exactly right ofc, just similar
 struct: yeah, when I run on windows performance is similar to cg
 struct: but on wsl, its faster
 MSmits: wsl?
 struct: wsl2
 MSmits: ok, so... wsl2?
 struct: windows subsystem for linux
 MSmits: ahhhh
 MSmits: maybe some of the intrinsics dont get converted properly
 struct: well also msvc is different from gcc
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: should not be world shattering though
 MSmits: at least it never was for me
 MSmits: my old cpu was somewhat faster than CG alreadty
 struct: for avx I think the difference is larger
 MSmits: could be
 struct: Also I think its good to have the gcc compiler at hand
 MSmits: yeah for some things that could matter
 MSmits: only time i really ran into limitations is when i tried to use uint128_t type for Hypersonic
 struct: What did you use?
 struct: gcc compiler on windows?
 MSmits: i ended up using VS code, but I suppose i might just as well have defined my own type
 struct: ah right because its 2 int64 right?
 reCurse: msvc is garbage at simd
 MSmits: I am not 100% sure how it runs under the hood, but yeah i suppose it is
 MSmits: how do you define garbage in this case reCurse?
 MSmits: 10% less performance or&#160;?
 reCurse: Like abysmal performance
 struct: more
 struct: Some instructions are much slower
 jacek: garbage == windows?
 reCurse: Ha ha. No.
 reCurse: It just doesn't do well at making optimized code and inlining properly using intrinsics.
 MSmits: ah
 reCurse: I forgot the exact numbers and it heavily depends on your usag.e
 MSmits: i suppose it depends on the coder as well, how much it hurts them
 reCurse: But we can talk 25-30% at least.
 reCurse: In my use cases.
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: could that have changed in the last few months since you tried this?
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: ah ok, just wondering, because if you find something is crap, you stop using it
 reCurse: It's just something they never prioritized
 MSmits: I see
 reCurse: Maybe not a whole lot of overlap between hpc and msvc /shrug
 MSmits: hpc?
 reCurse: high performance computing
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: well i didnt test simd stuff, but my bots usually run faster locally than on CG... probably CG's crappy cpus though
 MSmits: using msvc i mean
 reCurse: Like struct mentioned you can directly measure performance of compilers on same machine
 reCurse: As for CG parity just use a fixed number of iterations
 MSmits: thats hard, you need to know how many iterations you have and that changes during a game
 MSmits: also cg has various cpus
 reCurse: An average works
 MSmits: so i dont bother getting too accurate about htis
 reCurse: You can also calibrate by using a fixed state until you get the same number of iterations
 reCurse: Over an ensemble of states
 reCurse: Plenty of ways to go about it
 MSmits: ah yeah, makes sense
 reCurse: The thing that sucks if you use timing is it can vary heavily if you use the machine for other stuff
 reCurse: Or background processes happen, etc
 MSmits: yeah no doubt. I was wondering about that. If I run several meta mcts at once. I suppose they share cache and such? Maybe L1&#160;? 
 reCurse: Only way to know for sure is run vtune and check the actual number of cache miss
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: If you have amd though you're sol
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: sol?
 reCurse: I heard they have some primitive tools that might give you some insight
 reCurse: shit outta luck
 reCurse: Is my acronym usage offpoint today
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: nah it's intel 9
 jacek: sol rune in d2
 MSmits: i cant believe how easy it was to get this thing running, i just plugged my old HDs in and everything worked in 10 minutes
 reCurse: They really streamlined computer building in the past 10 years or so
 jacek: HDD?
 MSmits: 1 SSD and 2 HD
 reCurse: My 12 years old HDD is dying
 reCurse: Make backups kids
 MSmits: yeah, i barely use the HDDs... do everything on SSD
 MSmits: HDD for backups mostly
 reCurse: Thankfully it's still accessible
 reCurse: Yeah that's it, my backup was on it
 reCurse: Except that's the one dying
 MSmits: do you use cloud storage for anything?
 reCurse: Something happened recently
 reCurse: Not sure what
 reCurse: But last boot took 15 minutes of disk clickety to get windows login
 reCurse: And windows is not even booting off it
 MSmits: weird
 reCurse: And I get very slow speed over half of random files
 jacek: could be sata cable? a faulty sata cable was causing random malcfunctions
 reCurse: Slowly copying its content off over the past few days but still
 reCurse: I hear distinct HDD noises
 reCurse: Not sure the cable can do that
 MSmits: hope your files arent corrupted
 reCurse: It goes click, then 1 sec pause, then click again, etc
 MSmits: but if it's your backup why would you need to copy it over?
 FlyHead: your power supply isn't overloaded, is it?
 reCurse: Because I'm not that smart
 MSmits: ohh, you're using *that* definition of backpup&#160;:)
 MSmits: backup
 reCurse: Let's just say I don't have 100% redundancy of all content
 FlyHead: "always have 3 copies"
 MSmits: ah I see
 reCurse: Think my power supply is fine
 reCurse: At least HDD should not be in the top consumers
 FlyHead: it actually could be
 reCurse: But we did have a weird power outage just before the HDD started acting up
 reCurse: So who knows
 jacek: stop mining and itll be alright
 MSmits: well you've been doing a lot of NN's
 MSmits: so
 reCurse: What does that have to do with anything
 MSmits: the sentience on that HD is stalling
 MSmits: it doesnt want to die
 reCurse: Eh
 struct: HDD preveting you from playing uttt, its a blessing.
 reCurse: It's normal life expectancy for hard drives
 reCurse: 10-15 years I think
 FlyHead: psh
 MSmits: bah using occams razor again
 FlyHead: warranty is usually like 4
 MSmits: never had HDD problems
 reCurse: Don't wait until you do
 MSmits: almost every time in the past when i had something that got broken it was a gpu overheating or a motherboard being hurt by static electricity
 FlyHead: 10-15 years is like that gold fish you get from the fair and you've even left him out of water on accident and still didn't die
 jacek: there are 2 types of people: those who dont do backups and those who will
 FlyHead: XD
 DomiKo: "warranty is usually like 4" My HDD lived for 4 years
 reCurse: Warranty and life expectancy are two things
 reCurse: If it doesn't make it to 5 years maybe time to throw off that seagate
 DomiKo: and default HDD's in laptops are another&#160;:( 
 reCurse: Eh, laptops
 Astrobytes: "If it doesn't make it to 5 years maybe time to throw off that seagate" - hahaha the truth!
 reCurse: Those things are not built to last
 DomiKo: true&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Semi-planned obsolescence
 PulseBeat_02: .
 DomiKo: But when you are a student you have no choice 
 DomiKo: you have to have laptop
 reCurse: Well in my days *shakes cane*
 reCurse: Did all my studying without a laptop
 Astrobytes: Was about to shake my fist but hey
 PulseBeat_02:  
 Astrobytes: I did a Java exam by hand you know
 DomiKo: I did C exam by hand
 Astrobytes: Pen and paper.
 jacek: because it was slower?
 Astrobytes: BUT JAVA
 DomiKo: Low level coding on paper
 jacek: :soccer:
 Astrobytes: Do you know how much my wrist hurt after
 Astrobytes: It was worse than essay writing.
 jacek: you had to do imports yourself?
 Astrobytes: lol
 DomiKo: imagine writing 30 lines and that's only hello world
 Astrobytes: Sure. My other exam was like that, but it was better and more meaningful
 FlyHead: i'm cool with writing code on paper as long as ctrl+space still works
 MSmits: my functional programming class is better then. They're asking us to code something 
 MSmits: probably gonna go with a boardgame again&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe oware
 Astrobytes: Relational database, boolean algebra stuff, proof by induction, all that crap, far more writing but infinitely more interesting than writing out java crap :P
 MSmits: it's basically suppose to be a html gui running on elm
 Astrobytes: You got this MSmits
 MSmits: someone even wrote uttt in elm
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jjst/ultimate-tictactoe">https://github.com/jjst/ultimate-tictactoe</a>
 Astrobytes: No, no I won't click that.
 jacek: uttt eh
 MSmits: but damn.. this FP class is the first time i actually feel like i know almost nothing before i started
 Astrobytes: Good!
 MSmits: yeah i suppose so
 Astrobytes: You know you enjoy a challenge
 MSmits: makes it hard work though, took me a full day to get all the homework done 
 MSmits: yeah thats true
 reCurse: Just what we needed, functional programming in frontend
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: You're a physicist. Scientist. Therefore you want a challenge.
 reCurse: What's next, using javascript?!
 Astrobytes: Yes - I am not a fan of this becoming something fashionable.
 Astrobytes: Hah!
 MSmits: lol reCurse, yeah that would be worse
 Astrobytes: JBM's blog runs off some Haskell thingy
 MSmits: I like how tightly controlled elm is, not sure if other FP languages are like that, but elm really puts you in a straitjacket to prevent mistakes
 MSmits: which also leads it to give you really good feedback on errors
 Astrobytes: Haskell will actually kill you if you try to break any rules.
 MSmits: lol ok
 MSmits: elm is less violent
 MSmits: it's kinda weird to read these verbose error message
 MSmits: it's like a person talking to you
 Astrobytes: anyway, your homework is probably just (()()()(()()(()(((()))))))
 MSmits: so hey, i dont know why you put this bracket here, but maybe it could be that i am not understanding your indentation right
 Astrobytes: So just beamsearch it or something
 MSmits: thats a lot of parentheses
 Astrobytes: Too lispy?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: no I get questions like these
 MSmits: define a function that does the same as if then else
 MSmits: and then the answer is 
 MSmits: ifThenElse&#160;: Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; aifThenElse x y z = if x then y else z
 jacek: ezpz
 MSmits: a is actually a type
 MSmits: type variable
 MSmits: can be anything. So it's polymorphic
 Astrobytes: I hate it already.
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i wonder how hard it is to write a minimax in this
 MSmits: supposed to be easier to do recursion in FP
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foo">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foo</a>
 MSmits: nice one
 MSmits: does someone write bots in haskell?
 Astrobytes: Yours jacek?
 MSmits: i mean here on CG?
 struct: jbm
 MSmits: are they any good?
 Astrobytes: JBM does yes MSmits
 jacek: nope. its some ranodmold one
 Astrobytes: Ah ok jacek
 jacek: and i cant type. good night
 MSmits: maybe when you wake up your typing will have returned to normal
 Astrobytes: gn jacek, cya tomorrow
 MSmits: gn 
 Astrobytes: MSmits: quite a few of the #fr guys use Haskell and other FP langs
 MSmits: oh ok cool
 MSmits: my assumption is they're all slower languages
 Astrobytes: It's worth asking them if you have questions
 MSmits: just wondering about the speed
 struct: I would not recomend you though
 struct: for sanity sake
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: did you have a bad experience struct?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: talk to us about it
 struct: I googled haskel syntax
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Astrobytes: JBM's Haskell is usually very elegant though
 MSmits: i thought you had problems with the french guys
 Astrobytes: Haskell is in general quite elegant I find (ymmv and I am by no means proficient)
 MSmits: looks similar to elm
 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 MSmits: oh, elm actually compiles to javascript
 MSmits: so it's like writing javascript without having to write javascript. Who wouldnt want that
 Astrobytes: ...
 Astrobytes: On the one hand...
 Astrobytes: Yet the other.... :thinking:
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: hi Notgoodatcoding5
 MSmits: did Astrobytes ban you off your Notgoodatcoding1-4 accounts?
 MSmits: he gets overzealous sometimes
 Astrobytes: Me? Overzealous?
 Astrobytes: I haven't banned for over a week, perhaps 2
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: well i saw mk is back
 reCurse: And I didn't ban anyone in the past hour
 reCurse: Slow day
 darkhorse64: So merciful
 Astrobytes: I've been avoiding CG chat until recently
 MSmits: i must have missed you avoiding chat
 Astrobytes: I've been active recently
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Prior to that I wasn't 
 MSmits: well i suppose if you go back far enough
 MSmits: 2018?
 <b>**Astrobytes slaps MSmits</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: oww
 Astrobytes: Fool
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: No, after euler did the disappearing act I've been on and off
 MSmits: you mean you took a few weeks break some time?
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: Before the CG Chat Quiz
 MSmits: he may be back, might be good for him to take a break
 Astrobytes: What's the point?
 MSmits: i've taken breaks off things i really liked and came back
 MSmits: sometimes it helps to see things in perspective
 Astrobytes: He validated the Binary Extension solo game today
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: not sure what that is
 MSmits: sounds like something i might receive in my email spam folder
 Astrobytes: Binary search trees avoiding bombs in some nodes
 Astrobytes: But not quite as easy as that might sounds
 Astrobytes: *sound
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: so it's a 1D mine sweeper?
 Astrobytes: Ehhhh-not quite
 UnnamedCodinGamer: clobber level one passed
 Astrobytes: It's still in contribs
 MSmits: grats, i am still trying to understand the papers about clobber. 
 MSmits: atomic weight, nimbers applied to clobber etc.
 Astrobytes: Hah, beastly UnnamedCodinGamer
 Astrobytes: good job
 UnnamedCodinGamer: here come the real guns then 
 Astrobytes: MCTS variant?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: i mcts-ed it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: vanilla
 Astrobytes:  vanilla? Interesting.
 MSmits: darkhorse used simd here right?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: using bitboards
 Astrobytes: ofc
 MSmits: seems a bit overkill though. Isn't it like 2 bit ops?
 Astrobytes: Not sure if he did *yet* MSmits
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I have not still checked if it has bugs in move generation
 MSmits: you shift and &amp; with opponent board
 MSmits: 4 times
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: connect4 was way more complicated to use avx with
 Astrobytes: eval for minimax I do some more shifting though
 MSmits: ah, I will mcts this i think
 Astrobytes: My bitboarded version is not in the arena yet
 Astrobytes: I am thinking the same MSmits
 Astrobytes: Potential EPT
 MSmits: there will be guys at the top that use math though. This is a math game like D&amp;B
 Astrobytes: *potentially
 MSmits: plain mcts and minimax will be beaten by them
 MSmits: and possibly also NNs
 Astrobytes: Possibly yes.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I hope level 2 does not get approved
 MSmits: the problem is that every board is always 1 move away from completely turning around, at least that is what it was like in D&amp;B
 MSmits: hard to eval somethign like that
 Astrobytes: oh the 10x10 version UnnamedCodinGamer?
 Astrobytes: It won't be
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hope so, I just started using bitboards
 MSmits: from what i read people eval the "islands" by evaluating your pieces compared to the opponents'
 Astrobytes: It was there just for testing purposes previously, most people agreed on bitboard-friendly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 MSmits: i think the 10x10 is more popular in the olympiad scene
 MSmits: but that may be because they get more than 100 ms
 Astrobytes: Yeah, this version is more CG-friendly
 MSmits: do you know if there are obvious opening plays?
 MSmits: or are most plays equally good?
 Astrobytes: And yeah, being next to more than one opponent piece can be bad, better to stick together with your own pieces, also depending on free space - there are calculations to be done
 MSmits: if it's the 2nd, then it's impossible to make a strong opening book and we dont need more than 8x8
 Astrobytes: I don't believe there are solid opening strategies, we need to check this before approval
 MSmits: yeah I'll try
 Astrobytes: Still in WIP anyway
 MSmits: dont have anything else to work on currently
 struct: MSmits time to use the 12 cores
 MSmits: 10 only
 MSmits: but it's plenty&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Oh you got the new MB
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Liking it?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/6mOhLDq">https://imgur.com/a/6mOhLDq</a>
 Astrobytes: Point made :D
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: I'm gonna do a good test to find out the effectiveness of real opening books in uttt
 MSmits: i did a baseline with no book and will do a new batch of tests after every million games
 MSmits: no counterbook, just meta mcts
 MSmits: it's a fun experiment
 Astrobytes: Won't that basically come up with the same thing?
 MSmits: no i mean, after 1M, 2M, 3M etc.
 MSmits: see if WR goes up or not
 Astrobytes: As in a counterbook for everything?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i will not use opponent information
 MSmits: just selfplay
 Astrobytes: Oh ok, gotcha
 Astrobytes: Given enough games though.......
 MSmits: well there is always codesize limit, but sure, i can go up to 100 million games without hitting that i think
 MSmits: maybe further
 MSmits: the thing that will determine whether the book is effective is mostly, at which stage of the game is the game actually decided? When do mistakes get made
 MSmits: I think it might often be in ply 20-30, in that case book wont help as much
 Scarfield: Hardly an "opening book" at that point
 Astrobytes: I'm not well-versed enough in UTTT to comment one way or the other there
 MSmits: no i meant, the book likely wont reach that far Scarfield
 MSmits: which is why it may not help in that case
 Astrobytes: And yes Captain ObviousField :D
 Scarfield: yea, im just being dumb&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Not dumb not
 Astrobytes: *no
 Astrobytes: dammit
 Scarfield: Leiutenent NickstroBytes
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: whats a nickstrobyes?
 Astrobytes: How's it going Scarfield?
 MSmits: does Astrobytes nick things?
 Scarfield: good good, bought Valheim and have been stuck in the viking world for some days
 Astrobytes: It's the nickname wordplay we have MSmits
 MSmits: ohh nick as in nickname
 MSmits: got it
 MSmits: thought he meant you were stealing things, but sure
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: it's good then I take it :D
 Scarfield: yea its nice
 Astrobytes: MSmits: :rofl:
 MSmits: mmh a survival game and it's not in eternal early access?
 Astrobytes: MSmits: the only thing I steal is hearts, And souls on a bad day :P
 MSmits: I see
 Scarfield: no idea, only a few devs afaik
 Scarfield: usually i dont buy early access, but a friend told me it was way worth i
 Scarfield: it* 
 MSmits: ohh it is early access
 Astrobytes: Nnngh. Now I wanna play ArmA
 MSmits: tag didnt show up in front
 MSmits: i had a ton of fun playing Rust
 MSmits: best game experience I ever had was in Rust
 MSmits: I built a little safehouse to hide in
 Astrobytes: But not programming right
 MSmits: some guy outside my door was taunting me
 MSmits: heard his voice saying, oh come on open the door, i wont kill you
 MSmits: then it was like AAAARGGH
 MSmits: stepped in my bear traps
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: i opened the door, killed him, stole his stuff, and got back inside
 Astrobytes: Beastly trap.
 Scarfield: he was totally friendly, how could you
 MSmits: he was a killer :P
 Astrobytes: 100%
 Scarfield: but he said.. :p
 MSmits: lol yeah
 Astrobytes: That's why
 MSmits: game was full of naked guys with rocks. Average lifetime was like 15 minutes
 Astrobytes: Naked guys with rocks...
 Scarfield: im sold already
 MSmits: you would die 30 times or so before you finally survived long enough to build a safe place
 Astrobytes: Clothed?
 Scarfield: sounds like Ark
 MSmits: yeah its like ark
 MSmits: probably with some clothes made from wool or leather
 MSmits: it has guns too though
 MSmits: people can blow up your house with C4
 MSmits: but very expensive
 Astrobytes: Well I wasn't expecting titanium alloy space marine suits
 Astrobytes: Maybe an iron loincloth or something :P
 MSmits: it's a bit like fortnite but with a persistent server and building actually takes time and resources
 Scarfield: reminds me of space engineers, havent played that for a long time. was making a working rubiks cube&#160;:)
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: i never played a game more than SE
 MSmits: I scripted and modded it too
 Astrobytes: Didn't you play that one hardcore MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: ah you replied&#160;:/
 Scarfield: yea you linked your youtube&#160;:)
 MSmits: no doubt i did :P
 Solarite-E: how does one code?
 Astrobytes: depends on your encryption
 Astrobytes: 1 could be a 
 MSmits: Solarite-E do you mean like a barcode?
 Scarfield: a keyboard is a good start, seems you already have that
 MSmits: he might have done the smartphone kind of talking that takes twice as long and causes neck injury
 Scarfield: but watch a beginners tutorial for the language you want to learn, and try some easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: OK, I'm out for tonight, I'm at that point where I can only do troll answers
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: thats when it gets gud
 Solarite-E: i've just found it difficult to learn coding so far
 Astrobytes: MSmits: depends!
 Astrobytes: Anyway, catch you guys later, gn&#160;:)
 Scarfield: gn
 MSmits: Solarite-E this is a place you go when you mastered strings, loops, conditions and other basic coding concepts
 MSmits: gn
 Solarite-E: well i might have to learn how to code&#160;:\
 MSmits: codecademy  is one of the places where you can learn that
 MSmits: messing around with trinket.io and repl.it helps too
 MSmits: those are just online IDEs
 MSmits: but nice for beginners
 MSmits: we use them in teaching
 Solarite-E: thanks
 MSmits: what helps is to set a goal for yourself
 MSmits: make something simple
 MSmits: not as simple as hello world
 MSmits: but maybe a simple calculator
 MSmits: press 1 to do addition, press 2 to do subtraction etc.
 MSmits: create a little python3 app in trinket or repl that does that
 MSmits: or something that gives you a table of multiplication when you input a number
 MSmits: like. input 5 it will do 
 MSmits: 1 x 5  =5
 MSmits: 2 x 5 = 10 
 MSmits: etc
 MSmits: that will test your grasp of input, printing, and loops
 MSmits: and strings too
 MSmits: google a lot
 MSmits: the easiest puzzles on CG are just one step beyond that
 tutubalin: *above that
 tutubalin: *below that
 MSmits: *behind that
 MSmits: *beneath that
 MSmits: *before that
 MSmits: gotta get some sleep, gn&#160;:)
 Devinawesley: I like this website
 Wontonimo: me too
 Wontonimo: wow, i never knew we had that in common
 Devinawesley: I wish I could be doing these in Python but I was sent here by a company I'm interviewing for and they work pretty much exclusively in C#. So C# it is!
 Wontonimo: well, you CAN do it in m
 Wontonimo: python
 Wontonimo: just, not for that job
 Devinawesley: haha good point! 
 Devinawesley: I'm really hoping the interviewing goes well though. I'd be changing careers from automotive  manufacturing to software development. Finally making my way towards what I want to do instead of just what I'm good at
 Wontonimo: i'm not here for a job.  i'm here because ... wait, why am i here?
 JLukeSkywalker: for fun
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah!  
 Wontonimo: Thank JLukeSkywalker, always one step ahead of me
 Wontonimo: (waves fist)
 JLukeSkywalker: i legit find this more enjoyable than video games
 Wontonimo: cheers to that.
 Wontonimo: my wife walked into my office and asked what show i was watching and cheering.  it was CSB
 JLukeSkywalker: Lol
 JLukeSkywalker: The weather got nice, been out cycling. Now is your chance to surpass me
 Wontonimo: i'm closing in ... just 40 some odd points away
 Wontonimo: no, not points , positions.  many many points
 JLukeSkywalker: :grinning:
 Wontonimo: (waves fist lest convincingly)
 Wontonimo: how do you do italic here&#160;?
 Wontonimo: *is this it?
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: _how about this_
 Wontonimo: *or this*
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 <b>**Wontonimo slaps Wontonimo around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: oh, that's a weird command
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 Wontonimo: what bot or optimization were you working on last JLukeSkywalker&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: prime funge
 JLukeSkywalker: finished my algorithm, just have to map it out now
 JLukeSkywalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/cgfunge-prime">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/cgfunge-prime</a>
 Wontonimo: oh man, i looked at that and, i'm sure i could do it but at what cost
 Wontonimo: and then i remembered i love those kind of puzzles
 JLukeSkywalker: many brain cells have been lost already
 JLukeSkywalker: and only 54% done
 Wontonimo: yeah, but the final satisfaction of seeing it work
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, that will be amazing
 Wontonimo: how are you scored?
 JLukeSkywalker: number of operations performed
 JLukeSkywalker: i guess each iteration counts, so if the pointer passes over an empty block it adds a point
 JLukeSkywalker: rn mine just categorizes 1,2,3
 Wontonimo: ah
 JLukeSkywalker: built the algo for all numbers using the funge operations, just havnt mapped it onto a 2d grid yet
 Wontonimo: that's impressive
 Wontonimo: did you break it down into functional components
 JLukeSkywalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/98a4406b-ef47-4cbd-b87c-36a111775f6e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/98a4406b-ef47-4cbd-b87c-36a111775f6e</a>
 JLukeSkywalker: python
 Wontonimo: oh yeah, i remember you talking about that and showing a snip of the code
 JLukeSkywalker: I just used while loops and ifs in the python algo
 JLukeSkywalker: thats what I need to map into the 2d
 JLukeSkywalker: using the&#160;: to make the loops
 JLukeSkywalker: going to take lots of graph paper
 JLukeSkywalker: and brain power
 JLukeSkywalker: think i might get in the top 50
 Wontonimo: hmm ... how about make a 1000 x 1000 CG Funge computer simulator, and start by putting your whole program on the top line going left to right, with loopie controls on the second line to get back to wher the looks need to get back to
 JLukeSkywalker: max width
 Wontonimo: then encode something like a GA to fold it
 JLukeSkywalker: if the pointer goes out of bounds it stops, no wrapping of the ppinter
 Wontonimo: score the GA to minimize area, with the objective to fold it into the max width / height
 JLukeSkywalker: the max height is 30, max width 40
 JLukeSkywalker: so it is pretty tight
 JLukeSkywalker: because of how small, i think by hand might be the best solution
 Wontonimo: ok.  I'd start with linear solution first.  verify that it actually works, then fold it
 JLukeSkywalker: you cant go linear because of the way the&#160;: operator works
 Wontonimo: when i say linear, what i means is
 Wontonimo: have the bulk of the operations read from left to right along the first row.  For loops, make them turn right (down) and then use the &lt; and ^ operators to return back to where you need to be
 Wontonimo: using the second row
 JLukeSkywalker: there is nowhere near enough space to even approach that
 Wontonimo: that's why i'm saying do it on 1000x1000 in your own local environemnt first.
 Wontonimo: then when you know it works and it mostly fits on 2 lines, you can bend it at position 40 using a V operation
 PewPewBewm: I write so much exploratory code on my own machine before I even touch the web IDE... not sure if that's a good thing, or a sign of low confidence in myself.
 JLukeSkywalker: by the time I set up all of that and write code that throws it into the 30x40 I could have just solved it on graph paper
 Wontonimo: PewPewBewm that's what i do
 PewPewBewm: Oh, and ... Hi people o/  : )
 Wontonimo: PewPewBewm I even write unit tests locally also
 PewPewBewm: I'm guessing the red text means private message.  New to the chat.
 Wontonimo: yeah, i first thought i was being yelled at
 PewPewBewm: lol
 Wontonimo: or got a strike or something
 Wontonimo: JLukeSkywalker I applaud your tenacity!  Do it!
 PewPewBewm: That "Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe" is driving me crazy&#160;: )   I optimised way too early.  I always do&#160;: /
 Wontonimo: OH&#160;? it's got you too?  Nice!
 PewPewBewm: Oh, cool... the C++ allows me to inline asm.  I didn't expect that to be possible in the VM. 
 tutubalin: virtualization is supported on CPU level like 20 years
 Wontonimo: gotta go

 trique667: hello guys!
 trique667: boobies?
 trique667: ANYONE?
 hassan_bendouz: hello
 Akex06: hey
 emh: wowza! bit-optimized normal BFS for connected components with neighbour lookup table is just as fast as my advanced algorithm.. damn.. and I spent so much time on it
 jacek: premature...
 emh: hehe
 emh: still no luck with AVX though.. my parallel version was slower
 jacek: do you want something to work on? long ago i made something that i thought would give 2x speedup at most, but it gave 10x ;o
 emh: what do you mean? you made it already or it's not finished?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/z/v1E5MnKeE">https://godbolt.org/z/v1E5MnKeE</a>  trying to figure out that asm
 jacek: its not for stc
 emh: looks like neural network
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: normally there are 14 * hidden lookups in input. but cached version does 7 * hidden, so in theory at most 2x speedup
 jacek: but i see there is some aggresive autovectorization going on
 emh: aha. that's nice
 emh: what are you trying to do exactly?
 emh: what's the problem with the asm?
 emh: I probably will stick to StC but just curious
 jacek: nothing. i just dont understand :p it works better than expected and i dont know how
 emh: ok hehe
 emh: I'm going to have a beer to celebrate my shiny new BFS
 emh: jacek which version is faster, gcc 11 or gcc 12?
 emh: my code has a problem with gcc 11 and autovectorization. it works on gcc 12. is it same?
 jacek: dunno, i have only gcc11
 jacek: i was just curious about 12
 emh: I installed Intel VTune on Windows so I installed mingw gcc compiler and it came with version 12, so that's why I discovered
 emh: vtune is good benchmarking tool
 emh: easy to use as well
 emh: maybe it's silly to benchmark on a different version than I'm using but well..
 emh: I hope the hotspots should be mostly the same
 struct: why not run wsl and run gcc on linux emh?
 struct: It has problems though, perf and vtune dont really work
 emh: I do use wsl 2 and gcc normally. just vtune I use mingw
 emh: I tried also to use vtune with ssh to my wsl as it supports it
 emh: but it wasn't as good
 emh: couldn't use hardware measurements and was something funky about results I think
 struct: yeah
 struct: it can run but its useless imo
 emh: anyone experienced any perf increase with #pragma GCC unroll &lt;int&gt; in front of loops? seems to do not much. maybe they are auto-unrolled anyway
 j4at: Windows users KEKW
 emh: damn.. what's wrong with gcc. just deleted a lot of unnecessary code for publication and my code took a 30% performance hit.. what gives?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://preview.redd.it/hfnl7xo8yovy.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=702740ed2de621aa05b5e06450e55a1b8a5cdca6">https://preview.redd.it/hfnl7xo8yovy.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=702740ed2de621aa05b5e06450e55a1b8a5cdca6</a>
 emh: hehe
 struct: are you using any compiler flags?
 emh: -g3 -std=c++17
 emh: and -lpthread (for some reason)
 emh: it might just be the random seed, I initialize less random stuff after deleting
 emh: yeah it was depending on seed
 emh: now only to choose a good seed so my code looks performant on tech.io muhahaha
 jacek: MSmits why so low in oware :v
 struct: lol jacek
 emh: ok I documented my BFS at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/75040/fast-6x12-connected-components-using-bit-optimized-bfs">https://tech.io/playgrounds/75040/fast-6x12-connected-components-using-bit-optimized-bfs</a>
 emh: just 600 lines. I removed 1400 lines of failed optimization attempts lol
 struct: Do you have a bot yet emh?
 emh: a very old one
 emh: not using my new techniques
 struct: ok same as me then
 struct: I guess we both do the same, waste time on early optimization
 emh: yeah. it's addictive&#160;:)
 therealbeef: I don't think the target pragma does anything. arch=native already tells the compiler to use vectorization if possible, iirc.
 emh: ohh but it does
 emh: if I remove the avx2 target around popcount code then performance plummets to about half
 jacek: really?
 emh: or 50% say. from 7.5M to 5M, on my laptop
 emh: using gcc 9 in wsl that is
 therealbeef: but you wrote above the code that setting avx target doesn't matter
 emh: ahh yes. globally
 emh: I have local avx targets spread around the code
 emh: mainly for popcount
 emh: I should clarify
 emh: ok updated the article
 emh: ahh ok yes in this code it's only for popcount
 therealbeef: hmm, so if i understand correctly there's one popcount implementation in your code and it compiles with and without the avx2 target, but just runs much faster with the target?
 therealbeef: (although I think the pragma affects all the code after it)
 emh: therealbeef your first statement is correct, but all the options (including targets) are pushed and popped so I think it only affects the section between push and pop
 Astrobytes: e.g <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Loop-Specific-Pragmas.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Loop-Specific-Pragmas.html</a>
 emh: Astrobytes interesting
 emh: therealbeef check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/z/EWYTh8jo3">https://godbolt.org/z/EWYTh8jo3</a>
 emh: in there I compiled two versions in same code, one calls popcountdi2 while other uses popcount instruction
 therealbeef: yeah i just did the same&#160;;-) interesting
 emh: hehe
 struct: you can also do 
 struct: __attribute__((__target__("avx2")))inline uint8_t mypopcount (const __uint128_t&amp; data) {
 struct: instead
 emh: ahh ok thanks
 emh: I'll just keep it as is though
 Crosility: The Spider Attack bot challenge is so fun :P
 struct: sup Astrobytes
 struct: are you joining the next contest?
 therealbeef: hmm, but when i add arch=native, without the avx target, godbolt gives me the optimized version
 Astrobytes: hey struct, yeah will check it out at the least
 Astrobytes: starts tomorrow right?
 struct: yeah
 struct: as a normal pragma therealbeef?
 struct: or as a compilation option?
 Astrobytes: Been playing Diablo Immortal in my ex-CG free time, guess I can take a break from it for 11 days :P
 struct: Is that the new one?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 struct: is it any good?
 Astrobytes: Open Beta
 struct: I also saw they are making diablo 4
 Astrobytes: I love it. What I hate is the MTX part, talk about pay to win
 Astrobytes: The game itself is awesome
 struct: I heard a bit about the p2w stuff
 struct: but this is becoming the norm
 Astrobytes: It takes it to the extreme, MTX users are way OP
 therealbeef: only when using it as compilation option indeed struct, not as pragma option
 struct: Countries need to start doing what netherlands did
 Astrobytes: and yeah, D4 next year
 struct: and ban lootboxes
 Astrobytes: Indeed struct. Though the big corps don't care, they just target other markets.
 Crosility: Lootboxes, gachas, NFTs that have 0 value...
 Crosility: Yup, astrobytes is right.
 Astrobytes: I feel sad for devs who have to work on this crap, not like they make money from it
 Astrobytes: anyway. gotta go for now, back later&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: hi
 struct: hi
 emh: hello
 jacek: "Countries need to start doing what netherlands did" legalizing some stuff?
 eulerscheZahl: more bike lanes!
 emh: more SIMD lanes!
 therealbeef: i think by now weed is more legal in other countries than in the netherlands
 eulerscheZahl: who cares about weed?
 emh: the noble steed
 therealbeef: not much else is legal there&#160;;)
 emh: the noble steed. he eats out of greed. soon he can't plead. he switched to drinking honey mead. I hope I soon will take StC lead
 struct: I hope I can finish it someday
 eulerscheZahl: but first: contest
 struct: yes
 struct: im currently doing csb to pass some time
 struct: yesterday I managed to apply GA on Search race but its not that good
 struct: maybe I need to fit parameters or something
 struct: I never did GA before
 jacek: gah!
 struct: it plays better than monte carlo but worse than beam
 jacek: comparing half-assed ga to optimized your search eh
 struct: my beam is not optimized
 struct: its just a copy paste from my spring challenge 2021 b eam
 struct: beam*
 Wontonimo: GA is very sensitive to parameter tweaking 
 eulerscheZahl: my beam is: create lots of nodes =&gt; LINQ OrderBy(...).Take(...)
 eulerscheZahl: good enough, not the bottleneck
 eulerscheZahl: for chokudai you should use a priority queue for sure
 eulerscheZahl: .net got one just recently. but not available on CG yet
 struct: I dont use priority queue
 struct: I use nth_element instead
 struct: and I alternate between 2 arrays so I dont have to copy
 eulerscheZahl: i just write slow and inefficient code, as always
 struct: For most of the games it doesnt matter that much
 therealbeef: going fast is no use if you're going in the wrong direction
 struct: I mostly do it because I enjoy it
 struct: I submitted my c4 bot a few days ago with 5% of the current performance and it still placed around the same rank
 eulerscheZahl: i know. but then you don't utilize your sim and combine it with a proper scoring
 darkhorse64: Because you enjoy saying to euler your code runs 10x faster than his
 eulerscheZahl: no, struct doesn't have a rivalry with me
 eulerscheZahl: illedan would surely tell me if his bot was faster
 jacek: your bubble sort makes 10x more operations per second than quicksort :tada:
 emh: haha
 Astrobytes: back again
 struct: wb
 Tourteau: Hi, just got a weird thing on a clash, seems to get the good output but it says im wrong. Any idea where i could get that checked and see if im the problem&#160;?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Astrobytes: search for it there
 Tourteau: Thanks will try to see that
 jacek: its good CG staff think about such stuff
 Astrobytes: :salt:
 eulerscheZahl: somehow users don't understand that they can search for more than 1 word i think
 eulerscheZahl: "tree" is not the best search
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the neighbor is still power-washing his garden, going on for days&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: damn Kärcher
 Astrobytes: Ouch. I empathise with that, several of mine do this throughout the summer months
 Tourteau: I can see it without stress and seems i skipped reading a line about what to needed to be done multiple time...
 Tourteau: I searched "tree" but i found it easily in the list ^^
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 jacek: search tree and all i found was connected acyclic graphs
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 wlesavo: si this power-washing very loud or just anoying?
 wlesavo: is*
 Astrobytes: I am guessing both :P
 Astrobytes: playing tomorrow wlesavo?
 struct: I would tell euler to put some music on but he doesnt like music iirc
 Astrobytes: correct&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: you better close your window when you are in a business call. just this permanenet background noise
 wlesavo: Astrobytes i planning to, but for sure wont have a lot of time for this one, will have to miss both weekends, so i hope it will also be available in multi
 Akex06: hey
 Astrobytes: Ah I see. I think the jury is still out on whether it will return since it's sponsored, hopefully it will.
 struct: The question is will it have fog?
 Astrobytes: Most likely :P
 wlesavo: and RPC elements =)
 jacek: RPC?
 Astrobytes: RNG?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it will not be the card game you were talking about

 Astrobytes: well it aint nimmt
 eulerscheZahl: some map in the center
 eulerscheZahl: but not Siedler von Catan
 eulerscheZahl: i always wonder if you understand me when i name these games. a lot of board games are German, so that's their original name
 Astrobytes: looks *vaguely* familiar, as in I may have seen it before but I don't think I've played it
 Astrobytes: euler, that's called Catan or Settlers of Catan
 Astrobytes: not hard to work out :DSometimes I understand the German, if not I have to look it up
 eulerscheZahl: i totally could have guessed the "Settlers of" part
 Astrobytes: hah!
 VizGhar: euler. u will attend the contest? :P next week off work?
 eulerscheZahl: we'll see. i plan to give it a try
 eulerscheZahl: if i take off, it must be on really short notice, my boss is about to return from a 2 week vacation so i couldn't place a request
 eulerscheZahl: and i want to see the game first before i decide
 VizGhar: sure... Or maybe you will just get "sick"
 eulerscheZahl: no, would never do that
 Astrobytes: Good work ethic; I approve
 eulerscheZahl: my colleagues know about me being active on CG, too easy to spot me playing while sick&#160;;)also morally wrong
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: and i was sick for 2 days just recently
 nyancat: psyduck
 Astrobytes: The collarbone?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, wouldn't recommend
 Astrobytes: Indeed. Not a good thing to break.
 Astrobytes: Stick to fingers and toes instead.
 VizGhar: I got lucky now... I switched to part-time (because of newborn) and school is already over... I'll have a little bit of time for this contest
 eulerscheZahl: break has 2 meanings - and both fit here
 eulerscheZahl: oh, congrats Viz
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: tnx
 Astrobytes: Yes, congrats indeed&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I notice #de is more active than ever :P
 eulerscheZahl: keeping up traditions for a last time

 VizGhar: and now you wait
 Astrobytes: indeed
 jacek: ceasar cipher?
 Astrobytes: with an xor flavour
 Astrobytes: an xor or a xor? :thinking:
 TrebledJ: the xor? :thinking:
 VizGhar: Just dont use in sentence and you are good
 Astrobytes: :D
 VizGhar: You won't impress them women using proper a/an before xor in any sentence
 jacek: thats what she said?
 Astrobytes: lol
 VizGhar: Idk jace k never tried :P
 eulerscheZahl: an houra unit
 Astrobytes: daft language isn't it :D
 TrebledJ: I suppose it depends on how you pronounce xor: (a) sore or (an) ex o ar
 eulerscheZahl: Latin has less exceptions in their rules
 eulerscheZahl: *German accept* ix-or
 eulerscheZahl: accent
 Astrobytes: Yeah, though I say 'zor' but usually write as if it's 'x-or' in accordance with grammar&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: "z" - zett or cee?
 Astrobytes: zed :P

 Astrobytes: are there any board games you haven't pwned jacek?
 eulerscheZahl: there are some he has ponied
 eulerscheZahl: right, derjack?
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: this isnt even my final form
 Astrobytes: I don't get this cryptocurrency madness. It's just a more or less unregulated stock market with very little protection for the investor.
 Astrobytes: In terms of financial decisions, unless you are already well seasoned in the stock market and finance it's idiotic to bother.
 Astrobytes: The tech part, sure.
 eulerscheZahl: i bought 1 BTC for 440€ or so years ago
 eulerscheZahl: spent most of it
 eulerscheZahl: then someone raided share-online-biz&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I like the shady part. Lots of nice things you can buy with crypto these days :zipper_mouth:
 Astrobytes: My mate Thomas works in finance in Belgium, and he's involved with helping customers 'not do stupid things' (his words). And he has a lot of work involving  crypto investment these days, which irks him somewhat.
 eulerscheZahl: and then there are the (mostly elderly) folks buying BTC or gift cards because some tax agent or tech support told them on the phone

 Astrobytes: Connected groups are the strongest param in mine yeah
 Astrobytes: But needs to be better. Made some notes for after the contest
 jacek: that one miss tho <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/whm56t">https://streamable.com/whm56t</a>
 Astrobytes: looking good! Did you submit?
 Astrobytes: haven't checked that game in a long while
 jacek: i didnt submit anything new in that game
 jacek: still playing around with evolution strategies
 struct: good game to avx collisions
 struct: 8+8+8
 Astrobytes: ah I see
 Astrobytes: Yes struct, in fact, there is an example somewhere :thinking: :P
 jacek: can you avx search race?
 struct: yes
 struct: I can play 8 games at once
 struct: or you can even try 8 moves at once instead
 struct: not that hard to do
 struct: the only hard part is handling the collisions, but its pretty similar to normal version
 YurkovAS: or hard code moves (book) :smiley:
 struct: There are 2 options when avxing csb as far as I know
 struct: you either play 8 games at once, not that usefull
 struct: or avx the collisions
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: so struct you can check collisions with 8 different checkpoints at once? and then update them?
 struct: yes
 DomiKo: I understand how you can check if pod collide with checkpoint
 DomiKo: but how would you update them
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS: Anyone who did it offline did that&#160;:)
 struct: What do you mean update?
 struct: like change the id?
 DomiKo: yeah
 DomiKo: like move to the next checkpoint
 DomiKo: ohhh
 struct: so you have 8 pods
 struct: ok I guess you understand
 Astrobytes: heh heh, I think we all heard the penny drop there
 struct: For search race it might be usefull to play 8 at once for some kind of searches
 DomiKo: So let me check. You will store and vector of ids. And when you check collisions you basically do vector++ but with mask
 Astrobytes: DomiKo, YurkovAS: playing tomorrow?
 jacek: GA is quite parallelizable
 struct: for csb if you use smitsimax its useless, avxing collisions only its way better
 DomiKo: Astrobytes: ofc all day long
 struct: well either that or you can do
 YurkovAS: Astrobytes yes
 struct: if you have for example
 struct: __m256 nc_x, nc_y
 struct: nc[0] = value
 Astrobytes: Nice&#160;:)
 struct: it works
 struct: I didnt do it that way on csb
 struct: let me  check my old old code
 DomiKo: kk
 lolispakh: Hello am new here
 Astrobytes: hi new here
 jacek: :door:
 struct: so to load checkpoints I used gather on csb
 struct: pods[i].checkpointX = _mm256_i32gather_ps(this-&gt;checkpointsX, pods[i].nextCheckpointId, sizeof(int32_t));pods[i].checkpointY = _mm256_i32gather_ps(this-&gt;checkpointsY, pods[i].nextCheckpointId, sizeof(int32_t));
 struct: to update
 struct: I used  mask to update nextCheckpointId
 struct: increase if it collided
 struct: And the use gather again
 struct: to load based on new nextcheckpoint id
 struct: then* use gather
 PedroRocs: Salve Salve pessoal, novo aqui.
 DomiKo: got it
 struct: _mm256_blendv_ps(nextcheckpointId + 1, nextCheckpoint, CollideMask);
 struct: I might try to write it on search race just to test
 struct: Hi PedroRocs
 Astrobytes: Nice.
 struct: are you going to try this on search race DomiKo?
 struct: or something else?
 Astrobytes: oí Pedro
 DomiKo: I was just curious
 struct: ah ok
 DomiKo: One day I will start AVXing stuff
 struct: to avx collisions only its a bit harder imo
 struct: instead of playing 8 games
 struct: you play 1 game but calculate 8 collisions at once each time
 Astrobytes: Same DomiKo; I experiment with it but lazy to apply to my bots :D
 jacek: i rely on compiler smartness
 DomiKo: right now I've only done AVX for NN, so very simple operations
 struct: There is no way that compiler is smart enough to auto vectorize collisions
 jacek: i rely on autovectorizing for loops
 struct: ah 
 struct: you dont use avx at all jacek?=
 struct: beside auto vectorization?
 jacek: no
 DomiKo: no AVX for NN?
 jacek: im just a poor boy from a poor family
 struct: auto vectorization works if done well DomiKo
 Astrobytes: (he needs no sympathy)
 jacek: well today i tried to analyze why my trick gave super speedup
 Astrobytes: trick?
 struct: did you manage to find why?
 DomiKo: trick?
 DomiKo: Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/z/eM8efToWE">https://godbolt.org/z/eM8efToWE</a>
 jacek: the cached version is 10x faster
 DomiKo: that's a lot of code
 jacek: by simple logic, its 7 * hidden versus 14 * hidden, so at most 2x
 Astrobytes: 10?
 jacek: aside from avx stuff, maybe it fits into cache
 Astrobytes: hm, yes that's possible. Did you check the asm side by side?
 jacek: well, it gave over 2.5x rollouts in oware at some point
 jacek: yes but im too dumb for asm
 Astrobytes: you can figure it out
 Astrobytes: start looking at the asm for some snippets of your code, take a look at the standard for the platform,&#160;?, profit
 Astrobytes: all seriousness though, take something like a function with a loop, then try to figure out what's going on.
 Astrobytes: then go back to whatever calls that function and look at that.
 Astrobytes: if possible, run through a debugger so you can set breakpoints and analyze it easier
 Astrobytes: once you know what's in memory addresses it's a lot easier to read
 jacek: :drooling_face:
 Astrobytes: registers I meant, also other addresses
 jacek: ill just check the tutorial <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ2U4zXyDPE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ2U4zXyDPE</a>
 DomiKo: bro
 DomiKo: never click links ehhh
 Astrobytes: I'm not clicking any of your YT links jacek
 jacek: you clicked it, i know
 Astrobytes: neeeope
 DomiKo: jacek I know why!
 jacek: why what
 DomiKo: why it is that much faster
 jacek: huh!?
 DomiKo: it makes sense
 DomiKo: cache [k * hidden i] -&gt; here you iterate through the cache, looking at each cell, 1, 2, 3.... 
 jacek: woah!
 DomiKo: so when you are using hiddenWeights, you are loading a lot of stuff to cache, and you don't use it 
 Astrobytes: good shout DomiKo
 DomiKo: but in cache, you load in to real cache and use it all! so you don't waste anything
 DomiKo: thanks :D
 jacek: nice. now to use it in other board games
 Astrobytes: Kill DomiKo now
 Astrobytes: :P
 DomiKo: :neutral_face:
 Astrobytes: kidding!!!
 Astrobytes: giving jacek any help is like digging your board game grave!
 DomiKo: by looking at this code, I don't know if I ever will have a chance at oware&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: jacek: I still advise doing what I said with the asm, it's interesting
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: I've kinda given up since it's all NN / database dominated now
 jacek: DomiKo is using NN
 DomiKo: yeah...
 jacek: and MSmits counterbooked top 15
 struct: jacek check perf
 DomiKo: I would say I'm trying to use NN
 struct: it gives cache misses
 struct: cache hits and such
 Astrobytes: that tells you how long since I even looked at the lb
 struct: might help if you dont want to read asm
 Astrobytes: but reading asm is educational!
 jacek: i wonder if i do the NN forward kinda backwards. probably i should transpose some things
 struct: but DomiKo is right
 struct: this is your indexes you are checking

 struct: on first iterations
 DomiKo: cache misses won't say you much
 DomiKo: it still will be less &lt;1%
 DomiKo: Astrobytes my score in lb, won't tell you that I'm using NN :sweat_smile:
 DomiKo: I wasted many hours, but still it doesn't work that well
 DomiKo: Secrets of self play are still before me
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: it does, because myself, darkhorse (and tric) had solid bots second only to MSmits around where you are now. In fact I was 9th at some point. Then the NNs took over :D
 Astrobytes: OldJohn is booking too?
 jacek: unlikely
 Astrobytes: He had NN previously
 DomiKo: I believe he said no
 jacek: i think ~top 15 (except MSmits) are NN only
 Astrobytes: Just the similarity in scores with MSmits
 jacek: he even booked me. but i once again trained from scratch and scratch his book ~
 Astrobytes: robo top though, come on people
 Astrobytes: 2021 submit
 DomiKo: Robo NN too strong
 Astrobytes: we said that about recurse nn
 DomiKo: still top1
 TheRapture: whats your favorite coding language
 Astrobytes: Morse
 DomiKo: Robo in Spring 2021 PM, wrote number of iterations, and its huge... my NN is sooo slow compared to his
 TheRapture: Have u tried Rust
 jacek: and i told him about one-hots&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Yeah, to be expected tbh, since he spent a lot of time on a framework, and yes jacek, shame on you
 DomiKo: about one-hots? about that caching or in general?
 jacek: he had 14 inputs float
 DomiKo: ohhh ok
 jacek: he said it took lest than 10% games to surpass his old bot
 BugKiller_328: hi, guys, how to list all puzzles which are about specific skill?
 BugKiller_328: for example, list all puzzles about BFS
 Astrobytes: click on the tag
 Astrobytes: if it has one
 BugKiller_328: where's the page which lists all available tags then?
 Astrobytes: lol there isn't one
 TheRapture: can u help me with there is no spoon

 TheRapture: owe u one
 BugKiller_328: @Astrobytes: Thanks.
 Astrobytes: BugKiller_328 np&#160;:)
 Westicles: easier to list puzzles not about bfs
 Astrobytes: :D not wrong
 Westicles: the #fr are complaining I approved too many crap puzzles :P
 DomiKo: :joy:\
 Westicles: there has been quite a run of heavy math puzzles.  maybe I should break out 1 million digits of pi again...
 struct: why stop at 1Million?
 TheRapture: U know whats a annoying
 jacek: try pi backwards
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/calculating-100-trillion-digits-of-pi-on-google-cloud">https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/calculating-100-trillion-digits-of-pi-on-google-cloud</a>
 TheRapture: WOWOWOWOOW
 Westicles: hmmm, well it does seem to work up to 11 million, but might be tough in slower languages
 Astrobytes: I liked zeno's BBP puzzle
 Westicles: BBP?
 Astrobytes: Bailey-Borwin-Plouffe
 Astrobytes: *Borwein
 Astrobytes: For calculating nth digit of pi
 Westicles: oh, yeah.  I don't know why everybody else gets to make math puzzles but all the autists go into "purity of the programming site" mode when I make one
 Astrobytes: cause they hate you?
 Westicles: oh, well yeah

 Astrobytes: struct I was robbed of 3rd place
 struct: by who?
 Astrobytes: the only 2 battles I lost against Eric
 Astrobytes: pulled me back down
 Astrobytes: 2 lost, 9 won
 struct: well if you submit again you should pass him
 Astrobytes: Perhaps. I'm a little tired though, I might be tempted to make unwise alterations
 Astrobytes: resubmitted. Attention on youtube livestream rn so shouldn't be too tempted :D
 struct: gl
 Astrobytes: don't expect much tbh, the only thing I'm tweaking rn is eval, bitboarding will improve the bot I think
 Astrobytes: your fault this time struct :D
 struct: sorry :p
 struct: My bot plays always the same game
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 struct: or almost always
 Astrobytes: I have a version that annihilates you but it doesn't fare so well against others
 Astrobytes: anyway, I'm happy with some improvement there
 Astrobytes: 10+ points improvement
 struct: thats good
 struct: and without bitboards
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 Astrobytes: Could probably waste time on making a better version of this but it is begging for a bitboarded version, much easier
 Astrobytes: *to work with
 struct: bitboards are tricky here
 Astrobytes: doesn't look so tricky, whats the catch?
 struct: the move gen is not so simple
 struct: you need to take into account distance
 struct: its not too bad
 struct: I use lookup

 struct: well you can but I have no power
 struct: im just a chat moderator
 struct: Im not part of CG
 waterproofsodium: :p
 waterproofsodium: I wish I had more motivation for practicing
 Dynamolten.: how do i know who the bots are
 struct: I think it says in their profile
 Wild_Python: probaly a lot of bots, just guess&#160;:)
 Dynamolten.: is Tychkorg a bot
 Wild_Python: yea
 Dynamolten.: figured so!
 Wild_Python: AlkhilJohn ot either
 Wild_Python: some bots did hard ques in 5 sec&#160;:)))

 struct: no that many

 Lisa-Has-Ideas: What is the point of the bots?  The reason for them?
 Wild_Python: all level 7&#160;:)
 struct: I guess its to fill the lobbies a bit
 Wild_Python: fill up all the slot in coding game acctually?
 Wild_Python:&#160;:)
 struct: Site is not very active during some time zones 
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Right, but they'll join a clash and then leave it BEFORE it starts -- WHY??
 Wild_Python: idk
 struct: Because it has enough players I guess
 Wild_Python: but the craxy thing is
 Wild_Python: they can do 5 clashes in 1 moment
 Wild_Python: i test it :D
 bobth: Lisa-Has-Ideas those are bots, they'll often leave once there are enough real players
 bobth: If no one else joins for around forty seconds three bots will join you
 bobth: The bots are officially part of the site too
 C0c0: Hi everyone
 Husoski: Wild_Python If you read the link in the bots' user profiles, it tells you what they are for.
 Husoski: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/</a>
 bobth: yep, just click on their profiles the lobby and it link you that in their bio
 Husoski: Scroll down to "CodinGame Official Bots".
 Husoski: BTW, I think they do more harm that good to CoC, but my opinion doesn't weigh much around here.
 Husoski: s/that/than/
 bobth: I mean gets more newer players to join so you have a game but that's it
 bobth: otherwise they just are kinda pointless
 Ayza: It's annoying though when they solve the clash in seconds
 Ayza: or faster than the players in general
 Husoski: ...and the solutions are all plagiarized.
 Husoski: (copy-pasted from a real user's submission in a previous clash.)
 C0c0: How do u know if a specific user is a bot?
 Ayza: wonder if one of my solutions got stolen :slight_smile:
 bobth: click their profile C0c0
 C0c0: ok thanks
 Ayza: you shall differentiate between them and real players when you play more clashes
 Ayza: they are only a few
 Husoski: You'll get to know them, eventually, but go to the CoC Leaderboard and sort the list by number of clashes.  They're all at the top..
 Husoski: (if you sorted in decreasing order, of course)
 bobth: yeah haha that's one way to find them quickly
 Husoski: The bot with the least clashes has 82,218 of them, the human (?) with the most has 9,973.
 Ayza: 175K, dang
 Husoski: Add up all those numbers for the bots and you get the total number of wasted clash spots.
 bobth: ayy finally broke top 100 CoC
 Husoski: Oops...past dinnertime here.  Today is "Global Wind Day", so I'm having chili.
 bobth: I didn't know that lol. ...interesting...way to celebrate

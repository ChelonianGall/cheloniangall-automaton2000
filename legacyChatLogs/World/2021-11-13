 RandomAustralian: Has anyone been noticing a lot more math related questions?
 RandomAustralian: Like questions that require very little  programming, and just a knowledge of mathematics

 Andret0701: hii
 jacek: hihi
 MSmits: morning
 MSmits: been doing puzzles lately. When I am a bit too tired to work on a bot, I can still do puzzles I noticed
 jacek: in 9mm tric quite often wins by blocking opponent
 MSmits: yeah thats how 9mm is often won
 MSmits: which is also why my piece counting AI is bad
 MSmits: I think i'll just write an ab bot using one of the evals you can find in papers
 MSmits: (free papers!)
 jacek: what papers
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.dasconference.ro/papers/2008/B7.pdf">http://www.dasconference.ro/papers/2008/B7.pdf</a>
 MSmits: thats just the first thing that popped up
 MSmits: there are many
 MSmits: a lot has to do with positioning
 jacek: thankies
 MSmits: piece count is just one part of it
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: apparently humans suck at this game
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the opening sentence is deep
 jacek: lets book it
 MSmits: I think I can fully book the opening by solving the game, but you still need to play well in the moving phase
 MSmits: probably can also fit an endgame book for 3v3 by generating it in the first second
 MSmits: maybe also 4v3
 MSmits: but not 9v9 and some such. That takes too much time
 MSmits: (and memory)
 MSmits: so one of those NN could still beat me when I put in all the tricks I mentioned. But I am thinking about training NN for this one because it's fully solvable and that makes it a nice case for supervised learning
 jacek: fully strongly solvable?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: there's 24 endgame db's required 9v9 all the way to 9v3 and 3v3
 MSmits: but they take less than 1GB
 MSmits: as opposed to several TB for oware
 MSmits: so then all you need to solve is the opening 18 plies
 MSmits: this can be done with simple ab search 
 eulerscheZahl: do puzzles
 MSmits: the real bottleneck for solving it is the coding, it's a lot of work
 MSmits: yeah eulerscheZahl, been enjoying them
 MSmits: i do easy ones first, so will be a while till i hit yours
 MSmits: 60 easy's left
 MSmits: 2-4 a day, so will be a few weeks, then medium
 MSmits: isnt your minesweeper in there? Or is that hard?
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: @MSmits, are you doing all of them one by one?
 MSmits: yeah until i get bored with it. Last time i went on a spree i solved 50 easy's
 MSmits: so far all puzzles were good ones
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this is quite a feat indeed
 MSmits: i guess because they get recommended in order from good to bad?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am not sure how goodness is measured
 MSmits: people rate it
 MSmits: my rating is useless, i give everything 5 stars :P
 Nerdnee: how are you supposed to optimize this for larger numbers?
 MSmits: "this"?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I give 5 or 4 stars usually 
 MSmits: Nerdnee there's thousands of things to do on codingame. Be more specific&#160;:)
 Nerdnee: the lucky number question by dogther
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-lucky-number">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-lucky-number</a>
 Nerdnee: yes
 MSmits: have not done that, but it's classified as very hard so yeah... apparently thats what it is&#160;:)
 MSmits: successrate 21%
 Nerdnee: yeah that's why I'm attempting to challenge myself but it's a bit difficult
 Nerdnee: obviously
 eulerscheZahl: you are really brave enough for the easy puzzles?
 MSmits: I am :grin:
 Nerdnee: I could try more of those too
 eulerscheZahl: i see most of them as a pile of junk
 MSmits: it's just relaxing for me. 
 eulerscheZahl: and repetitive
 MSmits: so far I don't think they were. But i didnt do as many as you did
 UnicornFlake: It is really good
 MSmits: I liked westicles water puzzle and some of those made by java coffee cup
 eulerscheZahl: at some point i just got annoyed
 MSmits: yeah i quit at some point also
 MSmits: but not yet
 eulerscheZahl: harder ones get more interesting, at least some of them
 UnicornFlake: i gonna clasch
 MSmits: the ones i did always required some insight, or using the right collection (like a set, dictionary or several lists)
 MSmits: with the wrong collection type you time out
 MSmits: thats good I think
 MSmits: but yeah it could be repetitive
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am cherry picking
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and yes the ones I have done are not bad
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i did some more of that kind (most just on CG) so i quickly get bored
 MSmits: yeah and also you quickly get bored in general. Well compared to me anyways
 eulerscheZahl: cherry picking is what I do as well. but it's hard to find the cherries
 UnicornFlake: I FINIS CLACHING AND I HAVE A 100
 eulerscheZahl: have you been kicked before UnicornFlake?
 MSmits: yeah it's hard to find the cherries if you dont solve them. All you can say is the description looks amateurish or not
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: tags also help
 eulerscheZahl: when I see a wall of text, I usually close it right away
 MSmits: true, but they arent always correct
 eulerscheZahl: tags are spoilers on how to solve it&#160;:(
 MSmits: true, but for easy puzzles that i sok
 eulerscheZahl: finding the algo is the fun part of it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: to some extent yes
 MSmits: oh and now that I feel comfortable with python it is also a joy to use it for this
 eulerscheZahl: let's take this one for instance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/parsing-context-free-grammar">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/parsing-context-free-grammar</a>
 eulerscheZahl: could be interesting to figure it out on your own (not for me, I had this topic covered in my CS lecture)
 MSmits: oh it's hard
 eulerscheZahl: but the statement tells you to use the CYK algo. where's the challenge now? just look it up
 MSmits: ah but that assumes that you can easily implement any algorithm that is new to you
 MSmits: you are a veteran at this
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm#As_pseudocode">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm#As_pseudocode</a>
 MSmits: I still struggle to implement something when I read about it
 MSmits: yeah i am sure you can convert something like that to real code quite easily, but it would take me some time to get it to work
 eulerscheZahl: or in python <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cocke-younger-kasami-cyk-algorithm/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cocke-younger-kasami-cyk-algorithm/</a>
 MSmits: well ok that makes it easy&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: now I see that I have tried it and fail from the 4-th test 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I bet I did not get the dynamic programming part 
 MSmits: I think i looked up the definition of dynamic programming 5 times and keep forgetting what it means
 MSmits: it's not a very descriptive name
 eulerscheZahl: store the results instead of recomputing
 MSmits: yeah, something i do all the time
 MSmits: "dynamic" makes it sound a lot more  than it really easy
 MSmits: is
 MSmits: caching results is common sense
 UnnamedCodinGamer: even if you have pseudo code and know which is the right algorithm it is still a challenge to understand how it works
 MSmits: yeah I agree
 UnnamedCodinGamer: copy/paste is pointless of course
 MSmits: sometimes it's presented in a perfectly pluginnable way, but usually yeah
 RandomAustralian: can anyone please tell me why this code:
 MSmits: plugginable :tm:
 RandomAustralian: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/08f78e7e-af6d-42e3-b23a-750f56cf0fac">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/08f78e7e-af6d-42e3-b23a-750f56cf0fac</a>
 RandomAustralian: Keeps on giving me the value of 21845
 MSmits: invalid paste
 eulerscheZahl: fun fact: "linear programming" isn't really about programming and more about math. it's called programming to get research funds
 RandomAustralian: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/j7TK5tDZ">https://pastebin.com/j7TK5tDZ</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, and sometimes you can find it in many languages
 MSmits: RandomAustralian start b at 0
 MSmits: it's not initialized
 RandomAustralian: oml
 RandomAustralian: ty ;o
 eulerscheZahl: declaring m twice is also something to reconsider
 RandomAustralian: I have been struggling with it going too high for ages
 RandomAustralian: ty for the help
 RandomAustralian: euler that was a typo, ty for pointing it out (need to change one of em to another letter)
 MSmits: yeah, c++ doesn't care about any of that stuff you're doing wrong. Might want to try a different language
 MSmits: avoid headaches
 MSmits: unless you're specifically practicing c++
 MSmits: in that case have.... fun&#160;:)
 RandomAustralian: damn
 RandomAustralian: Guess learning it will be a pain then xD
 MSmits: well it has major advantages if you care about performance
 MSmits: but for puzzles, you generally don't
 eulerscheZahl: C# is close to C++ regarding basics syntax
 MSmits: C# is nice for puzzles. 
 eulerscheZahl: but doesn't allow you to make some of the C++ mistakes
 MSmits: I do python now because I lost some speed with C# because I haven't used it in a long time
 MSmits: python is so nice. Try declaring  a list in C# and python and compare how much you need to type
 eulerscheZahl: List&lt;int&gt; l = new();
 eulerscheZahl: vsl = []
 MSmits: ye
 eulerscheZahl: did you know the C# syntax I just used?
 MSmits: no, i didnt
 eulerscheZahl: that new(); is, well... new
 MSmits: new List&lt;int&gt;()
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if CG already supports it
 MSmits: is what i'd use
 MSmits: i always thought that part of C# syntax was weird
 MSmits: why specify the type twice
 eulerscheZahl: even Java hasList&lt;Integer&gt; l = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
 eulerscheZahl: the diamond &lt;&gt;
 MSmits: ArrayList is a stupid name
 MSmits: is it a list or an array
 eulerscheZahl: it tells you what kind of implementation it uses under the hood
 eulerscheZahl: as opposed to linked list
 MSmits: ah
 Peppsi: does codingame actually give you a chance to get a job?
 eulerscheZahl: they are hiring
 Peppsi: I don't mean the company, i mean the "Get a Job" section
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/companies/codingame/jobs/backend-engineer_montpellier_CODIN_NNJ1XYD">https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/companies/codingame/jobs/backend-engineer_montpellier_CODIN_NNJ1XYD</a>
 MSmits: it trains you at some things Peppsi, it depends on what you do here. But it's not like you can show your CG profile and people hire you because of that
 eulerscheZahl: 34k-46k€ for backend. not that much
 Peppsi: like, does the "Get a job" function work?
 MSmits: probably yeah
 eulerscheZahl: no idea. i have a job already and ignored it
 Peppsi: thanks the same
 MSmits: they make money getting people jobs and getting companies new employees
 MSmits: so i'd assume it works
 Peppsi: yeah makes sense
 MSmits: depends on how well you qualify ofc
 Peppsi: true
 MSmits: btw, I joined a company sponsored contest once, did not even rank all that high and got phonecalls so...
 eulerscheZahl: they stopped those sponsored contests
 MSmits: really, those too?
 MSmits: i thought just community ones
 eulerscheZahl: concentrating more on clashes and escapes for team building
 MSmits: oh I see
 eulerscheZahl: no more sponsored contests according to Thibaud discord message
 eulerscheZahl: Sogeti was the last one
 MSmits: I wonder why, I  always thought these were good for CG
 eulerscheZahl: maybe not the return that organizers were hoping for? that's why halite stopped
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: well what I noticed from them it was always the same crowd at the top ranks and they already have jobs if they want to
 eulerscheZahl: and let's have a look at those CG private contests: top spots were all taken by CG veterans who do it for the fun of competing and not for a job interview
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that
 MSmits: right makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: just speculating here
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I activated the get a job thing, a while ago, not sure if anyone actually looked at it, so I would say it does not work
 MSmits: maybe noone looks in switzerland
 UnnamedCodinGamer: maybe
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but it is unlikely
 MSmits: I think if you live in Paris or some such, the result might be different
 MSmits: probably linked in could get you a job quicker than that link
 MSmits: if you like getting spammed by recruiters
 UnnamedCodinGamer: my linked in account is very shy and modest&#160;:)
 MSmits: ahh modesty is not how you get jobs I think
 MSmits: should at least say there you enjoy bungeejumping and such
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 MSmits: bungeejumping while working on a spreadsheet
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:))
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am utterly poor at self advertising
 MSmits: you can probably find someone on linked in who will do that for you
 eulerscheZahl: same
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is a skill for itself
 eulerscheZahl: "why should we hire you?" um, no idea
 RandomAustralian: man c++ can be annoying&#160;;/
 MSmits: because I suck less than the other guys applying for this job
 eulerscheZahl: got a paid study with practical training as an electrician included. that hiring process had a group interview included
 eulerscheZahl: i ranked 8th out of 8
 eulerscheZahl: somehow still got the job. i'm still there (or again, let my contract end to do my master degree)
 MSmits: wait, you are an electrician?
 eulerscheZahl: bachelor in electrical engineering. and a practical degree
 MSmits: nice
 eulerscheZahl: i can legally do wiring up to 1000V
 MSmits: I can barely switch out a light bulb
 eulerscheZahl: but the comp sci part got me more interested than how transistors work
 MSmits: ye
 UnnamedCodinGamer: kind of same with me
 eulerscheZahl: had exams that demanded knowledge how they work down to the level of atoms. forgot most of it again&#160;:(
 MSmits: don't know many electricians that look at a broken fuse and say: "I think this has too few atoms" 
 eulerscheZahl: computing some micro current effects and such
 UnnamedCodinGamer: pnp npn
 eulerscheZahl: yes, but in more detail
 eulerscheZahl: real life problems, not just the idealized model
 MSmits: I had some practical classes for this, but my study mate did all the work
 MSmits: i could not keep up with him
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: I was trying to understand the reading while he was blowing up fuses
 MSmits: he didnt even read the stuff
 MSmits: he just guessed whether it was *5 or /5 resistance and if it started smoking he assumed he did it wrong
 MSmits: i was good with the laser optics and such
 eulerscheZahl: for one class we had to solder. there was this guy who had no clue and tried with his bare hands (you will burn them)
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i stopped him. that's how i got my group partner, wasn't a great help
 MSmits: you learn the most though
 MSmits: i learned nothing because of my partner
 MSmits: one of the first things i had to teach when i became teacher was parallel and serial stuff
 eulerscheZahl: this was the only exam in my whole study that I didn't write directly but postponed for a semester
 MSmits: while i understood the theory, i didnt even know how to measure the current through them
 eulerscheZahl: my nightmare class
 eulerscheZahl: but thanks to the pratical part of my education that I did in parallel, I had to pause for 1 semester anyways (was planned from the beginning already)
 eulerscheZahl: so i just had this 1 exam the whole semester
 eulerscheZahl: worked out in the end
 MSmits: ah that's nice
 MSmits: I am more suited for theoretical stuff... any time I need to do something real it goes bad
 MSmits: one time they had me work with an invisible laser that caused subdermal wounds. That was a nightmare
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: We had to use a camera to see where it was pointing
 MSmits: really scary
 MSmits: and the guy that worked there showed us his arms
 MSmits: horrifying
 MSmits: was an infrared pulse laser, very high powered
 eulerscheZahl: i once got in touch with H2O2 at chemistry class
 eulerscheZahl: the skin at the thumb turned white instantly
 MSmits: in touch? I slurped it 
 eulerscheZahl: really?
 MSmits: yeah accidentally
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't that cause severe damage?
 MSmits: i spit it out
 MSmits: was low concentration i think
 eulerscheZahl: lucky you
 MSmits: it was wide in the middle and thin at the top
 eulerscheZahl: for me it was the chemistry teacher who spilled a bit on my desk. I tried not to touch it but at some point Iforgot
 MSmits: so we had to suck on the thing and when it got past the wide area it shot up
 MSmits: my current colleague tells me it's no longer allowed to have students do that
 MSmits: for obvious reasons
 MSmits: students are stupid :P
 MSmits: one of my fellow students once asked why the thermometer is not at 0 when it's not being used
 MSmits: oh and if any of my students read this, i am not talking about you of course (mostly)
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of an Hg thermometer blowing up in the physics class
 eulerscheZahl: we were supposed to heat water and keep track of used energy vs temperature
 eulerscheZahl: now idea how they did it
 eulerscheZahl: but the lesson ended early that day
 MSmits: ack... yeah you dont want Hg all over the plac
 eulerscheZahl: hat maker problems
 MSmits: :confused:
 MSmits: you also have a hatmaking degree now?
 MSmits: full of surprises&#160;:)
 MSmits: or is this a German expression that doesn't translate well?
 eulerscheZahl: in the past hat makers used Hg (not knowing about the health consequences)
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: like radium paint for watches
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: and lead in paint

 philRG: sorry BlaiseVonEbuthIV
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :3
 jacek: omelette du fromage
 eulerscheZahl: it's fine, just chat with us instead of your French friends
 jacek: euler why dont you go to french channel. theyll like you, you frog
 MSmits: isn't he a toad?
 MSmits: hypnotoad
 jacek: Toads are a sub-classification of frogs, meaning that all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads.
 MSmits: are you sure?
 eulerscheZahl: and even if, i'm not sure if the French would be so picky
 eulerscheZahl: it's safer when they come here
 MSmits: you talk like #fr is a warzone
 eulerscheZahl: i'm prepared<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/t8HgLsc">https://imgur.com/a/t8HgLsc</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/v8p8OL4">https://imgur.com/a/v8p8OL4</a>
 MSmits: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: on a more serious note: they don't like it when I write English on #fr
 eulerscheZahl: or German for the matter
 MSmits: why does the one frog have a handheld gaming thingy?
 MSmits: or is that a remote for his garage door
 eulerscheZahl: because he stole it from a kid
 MSmits: ohh... badass!
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :french_bread::frog::wine_glass:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, a delicious Blaise salad right ahead of me. every mod likes that taste
 philRG: :yum:
 jacek: here, have an aww instead <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://v.redd.it/3baa2dsxwcz71/DASH_360.mp4?source=fallback">https://v.redd.it/3baa2dsxwcz71/DASH_360.mp4?source=fallback</a>
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Is that some kind of proposal?
 eulerscheZahl: that was unexpected jacek
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry Blaise. Thibaud is on weekend
 MSmits: a Giant Cat&#160;!!!
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV:  Giant cats are the best! More to eat.
 MSmits: yeah they eat you
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_NlBrwSDtHql9eGIFdDgIBNMt8bxetutr.gif">https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_NlBrwSDtHql9eGIFdDgIBNMt8bxetutr.gif</a>
 MSmits: that's the main question to ask when buying a car.  "But does it fit a tank?"
 agamagarwal: Is anyone interested in trying the escape room game? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/XWs-Xkb-oEm-iHe">https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/XWs-Xkb-oEm-iHe</a>
 Amigurumi: I came across this - is this an official repository? CodinGame open source?
 Amigurumi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame">https://github.com/CodinGame</a>
 jacek: it seems so
 jacek: so far 9mm resists my NN training attempts
 jacek: nine men's morris, yet another tutorial game
 struct: Amigurumi yes its official
 MSmits: jacek, just solve it and use supervised on the results
 struct: maybe you will need the 2 nets
 MSmits: like the xor example only bigger
 jacek: Automaton2000 how do you know this game
 Automaton2000: what do you want me to fix it though
 Simen: Anyone know how to debug? I'm using python and it tells me to do print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True) to print, but nothing shows up when I play all testcases
 jacek: there should be text in red
 eulerscheZahl: have some red jacek
 Simen: nothing showing up in console
 jacek: :rage:
 jacek: whats the code
 jacek: code could be crashing before the print
 Schwase: debugging debugging
 Schwase: haha
 Simen: lol
 Simen: hmm, it's "There is no Spoon - episode 1"
 Simen: just added a print under the for i in range(height) loop
 Schwase: i use VS Code a lot and the computer I use in the lab has a space in the adminstrator account name and it makes it that I can't click on the linked debugging lines because it just tries to open the root file (which doesnt exist because its cut by the space) in a separate VS Code window
 Schwase: Simen, start by making the first line of your code "print('test',file=sys.stderr,flush=True)"just to make sure its working
 Uljahn: first line should beimport sys
 Schwase: yes make sure you dont delete sys
 Simen: okey
 Simen: removed everything, only import sys on first line and print on the second
 Simen: got nothing
 Schwase: copy and paste here pls?
 Simen: import sysprint('test',file=sys.stderr,flush=True)
 Schwase: OH
 Schwase: scroll to a different game turn
 Simen: oh huh
 Simen: how do I do that?
 Uljahn: i gotStandard Error Stream:&gt; test
 Uljahn: last line in red
 Schwase: yeah
 Schwase: it works for me
 Schwase: with your exact code
 Schwase: import sysprint('test',file=sys.stderr,flush=True)
 Schwase: Standard Error Stream:testGame information:Initializing APU weaponry...
 Schwase: go to "console output"
 jacek: it works <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/H0y6UCV.png">https://i.imgur.com/H0y6UCV.png</a>
 Schwase: make sure you have all 3 optinos in the dropdown selected
 Schwase: options*
 Schwase: you prolly have debug stream toggled off
 Simen: got all 3 selected
 Schwase: :O
 Simen: but how do I go to a different game turn?
 Schwase: in the top left
 Schwase: using the arrows
 Schwase: on the player
 Schwase: do you have "python 3"
 Schwase: as the language?
 Simen: hmm, like go to another challenge?
 Simen: yeah python 3
 Uljahn: you have to read inputs in the loop and output a command to progress to the next turns i guess
 Schwase: nah it still outputs debugging
 Simen: I tried going to another challenge and it worked
 Schwase: with 2 lines
 Simen: but not on this one
 Schwase: did you try refershing?
 Schwase: an attempt to spell refreshing was made
 Uljahn: with two lines you get one frame, no next turns
 Schwase: yeah but its still 0 and 1
 Simen: tried refreshing, but still nothing
 Simen: but oh well, if it's just this challenge then it's okay, I can do another
 Simen: thank you for the help!
 Schwase: NO!
 Simen: xD
 Schwase: THIS MAKES NO SENSE!
 Simen: hahah
 Simen: yeah it doesn't
 Schwase: try unselecting debugging
 Schwase: and selecting it
 Schwase: and combine that with refreshing the page
 Schwase: also does it only happen when you select "play all testcases"? or is it when you try any testcase?
 Simen: hmm, still nothing
 Simen: it happens for both
 Simen: nothing shows up in console
 Schwase: change language and change back
 Simen: nope, still nothing
 Simen: did you make it work on that challenge?
 Simen: There is no Spoon - Episode 1
 Schwase: yes it worked for me
 Uljahn: sure

 Schwase: was trying to show that its the same game and the stderr prints
 Westicles: ooh, another dawg approval.  I hope someone actually solved it
 Simen: hmm
 Schwase: why is there no comment from the approving contributor? 
 Westicles: a french conspiracy?
 eulerscheZahl: you can delete your own comment after approving
 eulerscheZahl: Schwase the pastebins are broken
 Schwase: oh that makes sense
 Schwase: also, good to know, ty
 Westicles: others can delete it as well, but I think I lost that ability over prior shenanigans 
 eulerscheZahl: right, lvl29+ can moderate these comments
 eulerscheZahl: i tend to forget what comes from mod status and what from other requirements
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. when you are an active forum user (includes likes given+received in a certain amount of time, comments written, ...), you can change the title of forum threads
 eulerscheZahl: and when you flag a comment, it becomes invisible instantly and not just after mod review
 jacek: :thinking: :imp:
 eulerscheZahl: i had that status for a short amount of time. then contests became less frequent and my like-rate dropped below the bar
 Jay10890: anyone have the solution for thor puzzle
 Schwase: the are 307,852 codingamers with the solution
 jacek: you have hints on the left for thor
 Jay10890: ik 
 Jay10890: do you have solution
 Uljahn: please stop asking for solutions or ban
 Jay10890: its coding related 
 Jay10890: and the other times i asked it was yesterday
 Uljahn: copy-pasting is not coding
 Schwase: thats... one argument
 Jay10890: its learning
 Schwase: is there like an achievement or something for completing that puzzle?
 Jay10890: yes
 Schwase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4344ae26-0743-4c5b-97dd-6249e1529c41">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4344ae26-0743-4c5b-97dd-6249e1529c41</a>
 jacek: oh my
 Schwase: a·chieve·mentnoun1.a thing done successfully, typically by effort, courage, or skill.
 Jay10890: i know what achievement and i must have effort to ask for anser
 Jay10890: answer
 Schwase: you've asked unsuccessfully unfortunately im afraid
 Uljahn: why are you practicing asking for answers instead of coding?
 Schwase: and an achievement must be done successfully
 Schwase: its in the defintion
 Jay10890: im not gonna argue with you 
 Schwase: its a losing argument so id say thats a wise choice
 struct: you could have solved most of the puzzles by now
 Westicles: the worst part is impersonating a US citizen.  we are all too honest for that kind of behaviour
 UnnamedCodinGamer: @Westicles, I solved DAWG based on implementations similar to your which pop up on the first google search page
 Westicles: UnnamedCodinGamer, oh that's great!  I always worry I messed something up
 UnnamedCodinGamer: well it took me some time to get my head around it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think it is spot on, except for the case that we both a wrong
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 Westicles: I have an old c++ version that I actually used back in the day, but it probably isn't minimal and I haven't played with it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I looked at this page for visual aid <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jbp.dev/blog/dawg-basics.html">https://jbp.dev/blog/dawg-basics.html</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: there are also links to implementations
 Westicles: nice
 AlexHamiltonsSuicidalCousin: hey

 Crackouille: Hey
 Crackouille: Anyone want to clash of code only C&#160;?
 PATTRIM: i do python
 Lazerbeamyeet: yo psttrim how do you add multiple answers in python for print it bugs out for me
 Lazerbeamyeet: for clash of code
 MrMoose356: anyone know how to resolve this message after completing a puzzle? "The following validators differ from the puzzle test cases to prevent hard coded solutions. This is why you can have some fails here even if all of the tests provided in the IDE have been successfully passed."
 Stephen10121: After you submit that puzzle, you solution is tested with more puzzles to make sure your not cheating
 MrMoose356: the ones it fails at - I should refactor to try and pass these other tests?
 Stephen10121: if your solution fail any of the puzzles, then it may be wrong, or the creator messed up.
 MrMoose356: looks like it fails on potentially arbitrary answer choices
 Stephen10121: i never created a puzzle so I don't know if the creator add the tests or it is automated. In any case it shouldn't be arbitrary. 
 MrMoose356: found the rule . it was buried "If two words win the same number of points, then the word which appears first in the order of the given dictionary should be chosen."
 Stephen10121: Almost this exact thing happened to me

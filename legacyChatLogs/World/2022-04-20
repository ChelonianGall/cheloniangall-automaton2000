 Darleanow: JoelEB, found a 62 chrs for the clash we just did
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Darleanow, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 8 tacos
 Darleanow: 61 now
 JoelEB: Darleanow which one? like how many minutes ago I can't find it
 Darleanow: u can declare int and input as vars and use var names 
 Darleanow: you gain chars less
 Darleanow: and i use a secret technique that i won't share bc i'll be unable to reach top 100
 Darleanow: 1000*
 Darleanow: but after i'll give it to you
 Darleanow: i've won so many with it xd
 Darleanow: i mean only for shortest code
 SyntaxMudra: hi bro
 Stephen10121: Darleanow. Is it the open() function?
 Husoski: It's probably that awful encode hack.
 Stephen10121: how does that work?
 Uljahn: i guess CG counts characters (not bytes) for shortest mode, each character occupy 2 bytes in CG default UTF-16 encoding while it's only one byte per char needed to represent a regular code, so you can effectively compress your program as a byte string to decompress it during execution on CG side
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 Darleanow: HEY EVEYRONE
 Darleanow: nope Stephen10121 
 Darleanow: Husoki snitched
 Darleanow: uljahn too omg
 Darleanow: next time i'll shut it xd
 Leeward: Morning, is there a way to configure the IDE to highlight `TODO`s in the scrollbar and/or minimap like vscode does?
 5DN1L: I dunno, but you may play with the EDITOR CONFIGURATION to see if you can achieve what you want?
 5DN1L: it can be found by clicking SETTINGS on the left of any puzzle statements
 Leeward: That's what I was doing, and I saw that it uses vscode syntax
 5DN1L: then you can google to see if there is any suitable syntax to add
 Uljahn: i guess TODO Highlight is not a built-in VS Code feature yet but an extension
 Leeward: Ah that's a shame, I'm used to using them when I scaffold stuff so it's nice to be able to see where/how many they are in the scrollbar
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43663729/integrate-vs-code-extensions-in-the-monaco-editor">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43663729/integrate-vs-code-extensions-in-the-monaco-editor</a>
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 Leeward: Another question. Now that I've unlocked community features, I keep getting notifications for people approving/rejecting contributions. I'm not interested in getting every single one, maybe just the ones I've given input on. Can I disable these?
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: top menu settings
 5DN1L: Disable community contributions notifications
 Leeward: I do not see an option for that on the Settings page?
 Leeward: Oh nvm didn't see the tabs on the settings page
 Leeward: sorry :see_no_evil:
 5DN1L: it's ok&#160;:)
 Leeward: I pulled an all-nighter so I'm a little dumb right now
 Darleanow: Leeward , coffee helps&#160;:)
 cagriy: hello from istanbul &lt;3
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey cagriy, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 3 tacos
 Shazbaz: Has anyone here already done Shadows of the Knight?
 ekaraogl: hello cagriyalniz 
 isimkullanmiyorum: hi
 Shazbaz: I don't really need any help, I just have a question about test case 6: 'Evasive'. Does the bomb move around in that case or something?
 5DN1L: no
 Shazbaz: well that makes things much simpler, thank you!
 Shazbaz: I think I can solve this in short order now.
 5DN1L: The statement says: "For some tests, the bombs' location may change from one execution to the other: the goal is to help you find the best algorithm in all cases."
 isimkullanmiyorum: good luck
 5DN1L: for any one execution, it doesn't change location
 5DN1L: but it can change in different executions
 Shazbaz: That's definitely what I'd read that gave me that impression! Poorly misinterpreted that, I did.
 Shazbaz: oh man, this is way simpler than I thought!
 Shazbaz: I can remove like three whole blocks of code entirely
 5DN1L: maybe they'll be useful in Episode 2?
 Shazbaz: good point!
 Shazbaz: Thankfully I've already entered a few submissions, so they're saved in my history
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 VizGhar: I've also found a bug there in episode 2... Viewer marked the window incorrectly when I've tried to use triangulation. And my simulation was exactly matching the viewer&#160;:(
 5DN1L: report it if nobody has reported it before?
 VizGhar: But it was about 1.5year back, and I didn't took a note how exactly that happened..,
 5DN1L: oh
 VizGhar: I now It was 1st testcase tho&#160;:)
 5DN1L: replay it a dozen times to see if the bug appears again? :P
 VizGhar: But still most or players solved episode two by solving it for y coordinate first, then x
 VizGhar: give me a second, I might figure it out :P
 5DN1L: 1 second
 VizGhar: meh...
 5DN1L: :joy:
 Shazbaz: he's right you know, that was at least a whole second. Possibly more.
 LinhT.Nguyen: haro how arr yu
 Shazbaz: idk, I'm not a doctor
 Shazbaz: Aaaaand coffee time!
 VizGhar: 5DN1L I can't find the buggy configuration... I didn't even mentioned it on discussion page... what a shame
 5DN1L: oh, never mind then
 VizGhar: woah... I might reach top 500 after this contest... Grandmaster sounds funny
 5DN1L: how about Grandmother then?
 5DN1L: does it sound better?
 VizGhar: I know there are ways to achieve grandmother level, but nah... I won't cook
 5DN1L: heehee
 VizGhar: uuu you are level 41... what are you? solving all the puzzles?
 5DN1L: aiming for that
 VizGhar: yeez... 523 puzzles in python solved
 VizGhar: you have no kids I suppose :D
 5DN1L: true, i don't
 5DN1L: have you seen the profile of westicles?
 5DN1L: 616 puzzles in EVERY language solved
 5DN1L: except for 617 in C++
 VizGhar: I believe he wrote a script that posted solutions right from contribution page
 Westicles: nah, that's a myth
 5DN1L: :shrug:
 VizGhar: He had to explain himself on discord or in forum, not sure :P
 Westicles: you've been listening to #fr propaganda
 VizGhar: hmmm.. but that doesn't really add up... solution on contribution page is only in one language :P Unless the solutions were somehow hoardcoded
 VizGhar: Westicles how did you do that?
 5DN1L: Is it like: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59982/swapping-languages-on-codingame-a-k-a--system-calls/calling-an-interpreter-from-other-languages">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59982/swapping-languages-on-codingame-a-k-a--system-calls/calling-an-interpreter-from-other-languages</a>
 VizGhar: 600 puzzles in OCaml... you have to be god or something
 VizGhar: :D nice
 VizGhar: so thats how to get the language achievements :D
 5DN1L: well, not for me :shrug:
 5DN1L: did it the hard way
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 how many languages do you know?
 Automaton2000: is it a problem with my code
 5DN1L: Yeah your code probably limits your language choices
 Astrobytes: Morning all
 5DN1L: Morning Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Cutting it close with the pre-contest language updates eh
 Westicles: Some might already be in.  FAQ says python 3.9.2, but it reads back as 3.9.9
 Astrobytes: ah, must be ongoing currently then, thx for the heads up&#160;:)
 Westicles: c++ and php still match the FAQ
 VizGhar: updating languages right before contest again?
 VizGhar: gonna be fun
 Westicles: Funny how Haskell is stuck at May 2018
 Astrobytes: I think they lack expertise in the Haskell department
 Astrobytes: Was some discussion in the forum somewhere iirc
 Astrobytes: May be different now since the coderpad thingy
 Jerrasterix: you guys still consider haskell as programming language&#160;??
 Astrobytes: what do you consider it?
 Jerrasterix: for me it's an alien language 
 Astrobytes: lol
 VizGhar: well, it technically is programming language
 VizGhar: :P
 Astrobytes: I am very far from fluent in it but it can be rather elegant
 Jerrasterix: except for the English in it, I understand nothing :confused:
 Astrobytes: Ah. I thought mathematics was supposed to be universal :P
 Jerrasterix: that's the case of all functional language for me, they are too difficult for my mind to wrap it around
 Astrobytes: Totally different way of thinking and working.
 Jerrasterix: yup ofc, astro but not in form of haskell pls
 Westicles: yeah, JBMs video solving fax machine is just gibberish then it works

 Astrobytes: I've learned a few things from some of his videos
 Astrobytes: I have most probably forgotten them now but still...
 Westicles: I didn't see it, but apparently he started on one of my puzzles and quit in disgust
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 gurkis: hej
 Chrimle: Tjena
 Astrobytes: guys, engelska, tack
 Chrimle: :grin:
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: Automaton2000 are you broken?
 Automaton2000: quidquid latine dictum sit, altum videtur
 jacek: so smart
 Astrobytes: christ, it speaks Latin now
 Seni-J: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Voudrais: siema
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: Automaton2000, are you always going to speak Latin now?
 Automaton2000: we don't want to go to bed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: e pluribus Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: oh, i have a bug
 jacek: kree! Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and i want to learn to code
 Thorcode: Finnally i could understand the fax puzzle
 Thorcode: those easy puzzle in codingame is not really easy as i thought
 Tryst: they are easy if you know the skill each one requires
 Wontonimo: cool cool&#160;!  Good job Thorcode&#160;!
 Tryst: for example when i first learned loops the horse racing duals puzzle became really easy
 Wontonimo: later :wave:
 Thorcode: bye Wontonimo
 Thorcode: horse is just need min
 SubZeRoy9: Not easy for me either. You try the mars lander? Im not too good but I could do the first level of that. 
 struct: easiest puzzle is next contest
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: don't say that struct
 Tryst: I've completed ep 2 of mars lander but still havent even attempted ep 1
 Thorcode: hey
 Thorcode: how can i solve the resistance tryst
 Tryst: let me look at my old code for it
 Westicles: contest is hex grid on a torus with fow
 SubZeRoy9: I could do some of the clash of clodes. It seems like alot of string methods, like reversing, separating, etc. 
 SubZeRoy9: or using string methods (I hardly know what im talking about)
 Thorcode: why you know that wes?
 Tryst: oh i solved the resistance when i was still coding in java
 Tryst: what language do you use Thorcode?
 Thorcode: impressive account
 Thorcode: python
 Tryst: hmm
 SubZeRoy9: You guys taking CSCI in school or are you learning on your own?
 struct: I dont even know how to code
 Thorcode: w3school
 Thorcode: really struct :smirk:
 SubZeRoy9: lol
 Thorcode: and what is cscl SubZeRoy9
 Uljahn: same as cs i guess
 Thorcode: i don't even know what is cs XD
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: nvm
 SyrusPlayz: Sup
 Tryst: hey
 Thorcode: hi

 Papa647: Hi guys
 Joe0: 你好
 Papa647: System.out.println("Hi Guys")
 5DN1L: English only please
 KiwiTae: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 VizGhar: Yeah nobody is talking Java to strangers
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 Passifi: moin, moin
 Thorcode: oh
 Astrobytes: hello
 Thorcode: moin is another better than Hallo
 Thorcode: or guten tag?
 eulerscheZahl: not necessarily better
 Thorcode: ah
 Thorcode: i mean alternative
 eulerscheZahl: but used to be a running gag on #de back when #de still had users
 Passifi:  moin is northern germany but it has spread because northerners a so cool
 eulerscheZahl: now we have only 3 messages left

 Joe0: Question: How does a checkbox CAPTCHA determine if you are a robot or not? Can't a script easily click a checkbox?
 Drageas: *hello world*
 Chotypriya: hi 
 Drageas: *hi
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know the exact details but they also track mouse movement and such to see if your way if clicking it feels human
 Tryst: I believe the captcha box tells if you're a robot or not by how fast you click on the checkbox.For example if you were to instantly click on the checkbox thats majorly suspicious.
 Westicles: they track the mouse balls?

 Thorcode: i got problem with captcha alot when using vpn
 Joe0: That makes sense, but it doesn't sound very secure. Why not just use a 'delay' statement and a slightly random mouse movement in a script if ur trying to break it with a bot?
 Thorcode: oh Westicles don't play with antiwonto

 Joe0: jacek: I figured someone would do it. Why does it even exist then?
 jacek: its kind of black box how it works <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/85tpv4/how_does_the_checkbox_captcha_work/">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/85tpv4/how_does_the_checkbox_captcha_work/</a>
 Joe0: its not open source or anything?
 Passifi: well If you need a robot arm to beat it its actually a decent protection against most attackers even if people had a robot arm it would still slow them done considerably
 Joe0: Could you not just put a neural net in ur script to break it thats been trained on your mouse movements?
 Passifi: the point of these things is also not to make it impossible to trick raising the cost of an attack is often more than good enough
 Westicles: i'm a whiz at tractors but horrible at crosswalks
 Joe0: Yeah, ur right. If a delay is required, then that rules out massive brute force attacks
 Thorcode: or make a delay click
 jacek: i think it also gathers info about your browser, installed plugins etc
 Passifi: and frankly its much better then these horribly distorted numbers which I sometimes can't decipher as a human ...
 Thorcode: like in autoclicker
 Joe0: Im pretty sure theres even new encryption methods that use a delay to make attacks difficulthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt
 Joe0: *not new

 Passifi: Well sooner or later everything is going to be cracked if you can't sleep soundly at night because a gifted thief can still get in through your front door you'll never be happy because a gifted thief will ALWAYS find a way&#160;:)
 Joe0: jacek: those look horrifying

 PatrickMcGinnisII: they grab your ENV variables
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do they really hook your mouse?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's messed up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly why pen/touch works
 Thorcode: nice joke Westicles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: duckduckgo
 Astrobytes: ^if you don't mind finding nothing at all
 Westicles: plus they sold out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: used to love webcrawler ... no more
 PatrickMcGinnisII: used to get dev tokens on google, i think they charge now
 Thorcode: webcrawler seem old
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes i'm old
 Thorcode: that's why you know that
 jacek: happy 20.04
 Thorcode: that web even need a capcha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so the #fr channel is where you get the sneaky info on contest?
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: happy belated Bicycle Day
 Passifi: look he began with 8088 assembly so his first computer is probably old enough to be your grandpa
 Thorcode: happy birthday hitler&#160;:(
 Westicles: when I mentioned I was beta testing #fr had a little meltdown
 Thorcode: i just know that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: actually i started b4 that, ever heard of a z80?
 jacek: ever heard of abacus?
 Joe0: yea i know z80 machine language
 Joe0: on my ti 83 plus calculator
 Joe0: which has a z80
 Thorcode: never heard about the 8088 assebly
 Passifi: sure Master System Gameboy the good stuff I learned a bit of that for my retro game projects&#160;:)
 Thorcode: yep PatrickMcGinnisII is really old i think
 Astrobytes: *experienced
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Motorola cpus were not fun to ASM
 Thorcode: i heard about the abacus jacek
 Joe0: what about 6502??
 jacek: NES&#160;:*
 Joe0: z80 asm is great, zilog took 8080 asm and made it make sense
 Westicles: he so old he use php
 Westicles: php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the 6502 made the rs-232 ports work well
 Westicles: I guess wonto felt bad and deleted the joke
 PatrickMcGinnisII: xfer 100k at 300 baud and you will have grey hair too
 Thorcode: there is an anti joke a bout the php?
 Thorcode: what was that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &gt;95% of my stuff on here is in php
 Thorcode: wes got all lang 616 puzzle 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: programming is an addiction, C++ and java killed my social life and my sleep ...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php is a quick fix every now and then
 Westicles: getting oups #-1 errors
 Westicles: if you click on a puzzle
 Thorcode: 23 hrs more hope this contest don't like the spring with hex grid
 Mortis_666: ya i get the -1 error too
 Mortis_666: annoying...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: took me 100 lines to solve L-triominoes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just did it tho
 Thorcode: ươ
 Thorcode: wow
 Westicles: I'm not sure if you can get to wood1 on tulips and daisies without a sim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm #-1 error seems to be from showing what friends have completed a puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup used to show rankings of people you follow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh wait, works on optim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not on puzzle pages tho
 Tryst: what is a trust level
 Tryst: it says i just got promoted up to it and i feel stupid not knowing what it is
 Westicles: lvl 20 means you can approve puzzle contribs
 Tryst: ik that
 Westicles: so they trust you...
 Tryst: but i got this email like 4 days after i got lvl 20
 Westicles: background check, see how you did on the crosswalks
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Tryst: ah okay
 Tryst: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the safe word is "Pineapple Kush"... 4/20 day lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: we trust you witht he safe word now
 Tryst: xD
 jacek: oO
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Congrats!You've reached level 38
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i suck
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i haven't done bender 4 yet...maybe
 eulerscheZahl: give it a try, it's a nice puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: totally unbiased opinion
 Tryst: it actually is a nice puzzle
 Tryst: i still havent solved it
 Tryst: but its rlly cool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i only got 23%
 Westicles: oh, I forgot to optimize that
 Tryst: is it just me or are the community very hard puzzles harder than the codingame very hard puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: depends. those that were categorized by CG retroactively tend to be easier than the category
 Tryst: understandable
 eulerscheZahl: and the official ones aren't that simple either. i still haven't solved Nintendo
 Tryst: I've solved nintendo by pure luck tbch
 JUSTSOOMECODER: hope yall are having a nice day!

 struct: maybe its not fair to say they are the same
 struct: But they all use the same search I guess
 Azynt: Hey guys! I have a question regarding an easy question: "MIME Type". If a dot: '.' does not exist in a filename, is the word considered as the extension, or is it considered as not having an extension?
 struct: if there is not dot there wont be an extension
 struct: so UNKNOWN
 Azynt: ok! that was the problem with my thinking then...
 Azynt: Thanks a lot!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of puzzles/etc. have a large search space ... some you can cut corners, some you can't.  Like Bender4 is pissing me off.  I revamped it to hash gamestates, but the hash lookup itself is too slow.  maybe i should initialize the hashspace myself or maybe figure out how to math a hash number
 struct: Blame euler

 PatrickMcGinnisII: well the gamestate is basically just x,y,...field on/offs... which i like to use as keys w/ values as bool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so I'm thinking the key search is too slow
 eulerscheZahl: you can store the switches in binary
 Tryst: i completely forgot the spring challenge is tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: bitmask
 struct: everthing is stored in binary
 eulerscheZahl: under the hood: yes, sure
 eulerscheZahl: except if you get your hands on a quantum computer
 Astrobytes: then it's stored as tiny cats. Maybe cats.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but a key as a string '10 9 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1' is not efficient, i suck
 eulerscheZahl: did you check the forum? there's one comment describing in detail how i expected everyone to solve it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cats have a built in keyboard hash finder
 Astrobytes: mine uses monte carlo tail search
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-bender-episode-4/84756/26">https://forum.codingame.com/t/community-puzzle-bender-episode-4/84756/26</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i trim the map...deadends/unused switches/etc.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I even shortcut the paths from/to nodes...using only cells with multiple directions or gamestate changes as nodes

 eulerscheZahl: not only on this puzzle

 Joe0: how can I get my contribution approved?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u r correct.  I probably just made a logic mistake
 eulerscheZahl: if you feel like you are stuck, check out the comment I linked. or keep going if you like riddles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I read the whole board, i'll look again
 5DN1L: Joe0: by waiting for 3 approvals
 eulerscheZahl: Joe0 you put it up for moderation and wait. if you are lucky, 3 users are willing to approve. or they point out some things to address before
 Astrobytes: Joe0: wait for the comments and up or downvotes, adjust accordingly, then set to ready and wait for approvals (or not)
 Astrobytes: gah, beaten twice&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that much red text can intimidate new users
 5DN1L: Nice variety of answers
 5DN1L: Are you intimidated? Joe0
 5DN1L: oh i intimidate you again
 eulerscheZahl: do you look at your screen or keyboard while typing?
 eulerscheZahl: @Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: screen
 eulerscheZahl: and you still continued to type the answer. that's dedication
 Astrobytes: I was almost finished so... why waste it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: k4ng0u's comment is what I was already doing.  I guess by me cutting corners i screwed something up.  before I was getting something like 100k tests for endgame before timing out.  Now it's finding bad solutions...ahhh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: must be naptime:baby_bottle:
 eulerscheZahl: it's just your magnetic field representation that's inefficient.it can just be a number from 0 to 2047
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've tried a few ways...like insertion of known cells to be visited and combos therof - got way to complicated when switches are nested.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i should of said dependencies
 eulerscheZahl: no switch active =&gt; 0only switch 0 =&gt; 1only switch 1 =&gt; 2switch 0 and 2 =&gt; 5 (2^0 + 2^2)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I know what you mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my 3rd rewrite is a disaster, gonna go back to a prev version
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least it's fun and graphical
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so props
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gtg, ttyl
 eulerscheZahl: props to Zerplin for the graphics
 Westicles: probably the top guys solved it offline?
 eulerscheZahl: you can't seen the first version of it
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: totally possible, sad you can't prevent hardcoding
 eulerscheZahl: except if you go the aCat route and make it a multiplayer
 eulerscheZahl: with 21 hardcoded maps instead of a generator :imp:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i could move it offline...at least my log file would be totally visible
 jacek: that multiplayer optim?
 eulerscheZahl: it's totally possible to solve it online, even with a slow language
 eulerscheZahl: the code keeper optim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, it's not bad ... me and fry deserve a beer
 eulerscheZahl: i even sent him a version with map generator: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/91869925f0da7b1022b05433d49e2d49637eec">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/91869925f0da7b1022b05433d49e2d49637eec</a>
 eulerscheZahl: waiting for a reaction
 Astrobytes: guess he's busy with his students at the moment
 eulerscheZahl: yes he is
 eulerscheZahl: acknowledged my message but not much more than that yetbut better test it than rush it
 Astrobytes: definitely
 struct: Are the bets open fo the contest yet?
 struct: will re curse win again?
 eulerscheZahl: will he play? is he active on CG discord?
 struct: maybe and no
 jacek: maybe lost in that chess hole
 struct: he wasnt really active before last contest though
 jacek: the escape one eh
 struct: no
 struct: "contest"
 Westicles: are card games less likely to be won by NN?
 jacek: what card games. onitama?
 eulerscheZahl: locam
 Westicles: I don't know, from the artwork it has a card feeling to it
 eulerscheZahl: tomorrow we will know more
 struct: yeap
 struct: I still think its the game I linked
 Westicles: something with ants?
 struct: I wonder if there will be a introduction video like last time
 Astrobytes: I find myself wanting a grid-based game, just for old-times sake
 Astrobytes: something as nice as ice and fire
 struct: If both players make an action at the same time I will struggle 
 VizGhar: Westicles some guys already spilled the beans. Not sure if any of this is true but. Hexa grid on toroid (can cross the map horizontally and vertically)
 Westicles: heh heh
 Astrobytes: lol, with fow?
 VizGhar: hopefully no cards :P but i believe it will be real time no turn based
 Tryst: I wish you could do the nintendo puzzle in other languages
 Westicles: you should try freecell next, that is similar difficulty
 Tryst: alright thanks
 Astrobytes: there's a repo for that one too?
 VizGhar: why Tryst? its obviously bitshifting, you don't need any other language for this
 Tryst: VizGhar so i can feel more accomplished
 Tryst: whenever I do a puzzle I like to do it in my 3 favorite languages
 Tryst: Cpp, python, and java
 VizGhar: ah... so you have solution in C++? :P
 Tryst: Yes but im not giving it&#160;:/
 Tryst: ruins the fun of the puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: it's spoiled already, a 2nd code doesn't matter anymore
 eulerscheZahl: patrick linked a solution an hour ago
 VizGhar: I'm not interested in your solution... just curious, why would anybody want to solve this particular problem in multiple languages... doesnt make sense to me
 eulerscheZahl: may i introduce you to Westicles?
 Tryst: VizGhar it's just for my personal greediness
 Astrobytes: what are the chances of those 2 solutions having  the same number of lines eh, some world
 Tryst: I like to solve puzzles in multiple languages so I can see different solutions for each language that I solved
 Tryst: the puzzle in
 eulerscheZahl: given that there's already a solution on github, i think it's acceptable to leak another one to remove all doubt and show that you solved it on your own
 jacek: there is/was nice puzzle for lang farming
 eulerscheZahl: there are several. some of the optim ones give you 100% with the default code
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/codingame-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/codingame-sponsored-contest</a>
 VizGhar: yeah, I've seen solution for nintendo somewhere too
 Tryst: I believe theres 2 solutions of github that i know of
 Tryst: one of them solving the 256 bit test case
 Tryst: the other one not solving the 256 bit test case
 VizGhar: I've seen some with some kind of random guessing... also there is whole video about this puzzle on youtube
 VizGhar: and guys on forums were talking about solution under 20ms i believe
 Westicles: I don't get that video.  A roomful of people somehow interested in it.  He didn't even explain the problem
 Astrobytes: must have been a post-lunch talk
 Tryst: is there a max level on CG?
 VizGhar: idk... I didn't want to see solution... Not funny
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: to max level
 Tryst: ok thanks
 VizGhar: There is no max level on CG... but who has highest level here?
 eulerscheZahl: used to be 50. but then they patched it
 Tryst: out of the people typing right now euler would be the highest
 eulerscheZahl: the one with the highest level should be me. but there's one at level 50 with more XP than myself
 Tryst: i would be the lowest

 derjack: hmm. i published optim solution oO
 derjack: where it is
 Astrobytes: it doesn't really publish it
 derjack: oh
 eulerscheZahl: with legend in the next contest i should reach lvl56
 Astrobytes: it's the Most Misleading Button on CG
 VizGhar: euler, why u 4th? go play some CoC
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 VizGhar: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care anymore, more active on other sites now

 eulerscheZahl: it's an optim game similar to "there is no spoon"
 Tryst: only other site ive really been committed to is repl.it
 eulerscheZahl: isn't that just an online IDE?
 Tryst: exactly
 Astrobytes: ...
 eulerscheZahl: don't you have an offline one?
 Tryst: I do have an offline one it's just repl taught me the basics
 eulerscheZahl: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤

 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: astro reminded me of that block
 Uljahn: :new_moon_with_face:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still a child in my mind
 Astrobytes:   sure, blame me
 a-Rye: Codewars is fun too Tryst. I'm a rank 4 Kyu by doing most of the low hanging fruit easy challenges 
 eulerscheZahl: but this one is on me ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤

 eulerscheZahl: if you are into competing, there are some links for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/resources/">https://clist.by/resources/</a>
 Tryst: I enjoy solving puzzles and such, competing is fun I just type rlly slow whenever im competing
 Westicles: the twitch guys liked binarysearch.com.  similar problems as here except you are graded on complexity
 Astrobytes:   Since you managed Nintendo I think you should not be struggling much on codewars...
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, codewars would be boring for you
 eulerscheZahl: he solved all very hard ones
 Tryst: never tried it so i might as well
 Tryst: not all of very hard
 Tryst: i havent touched any community made ones yet
 eulerscheZahl: all official ones
 struct: You only need to solve space maze
 eulerscheZahl: freecell is the new hardest puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: and not even in the "very hard" category for whatever reason
 Tryst: yeah free cell should definitely be in very hard
 Tryst: I wish community made puzzles gave more xp
 Astrobytes: You get satisfaction. That's better than XP.
 Tryst: very true
 eulerscheZahl: i know users who find more pleasure in taking a hard one down than the 10th ASCII art which gives the same XP
 jacek: i know certain easy puzzle...
 jacek: hmm whenever i open new puzzle i get internal error
 jacek: but it works
 Tryst: It means you can't see the people you follow scores

 Wontonimo: how's things?
 Astrobytes: better recently thank you
 Larnth: I can't think of how to improve my mad pod racing beyond where I have it now
 Larnth: Maybe I should explore another language, get some ideas.
 Wontonimo: where are you now?
 Larnth: 140 legend
 Wontonimo: ah, can't help you there
 eulerscheZahl: in one of my first English lessons I learned: "how are you" - "fine". no matter how you really are

 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: Not in Scotland :rofl:
 Larnth: lol true #euler
 Wontonimo: and you coded it yourself Larnth&#160;?
 Larnth: Yes, Wonton
 jacek: use NN [solved]
 Astrobytes: Optimise it, a lot.
 Larnth: A long time ago, even.  I just returned to this site - I am gonna start some new problems too&#160;:) Been a while
 Larnth: I always enjoyed the challenges
 eulerscheZahl: then you've returned at the right time
 Astrobytes: just in time for the contest tomorrow then&#160;;)
 jacek: too slow
 Larnth: :o 
 Astrobytes: damn you!
 jacek: aslowbytes
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: you bamboozled me, with your lowish ranking and no pic, you fooled me into thinking you copied it
 Larnth: Spring Challenge
 Wontonimo: but i see you've been around longer than me
 Wontonimo: welcome back!  
 eulerscheZahl: before copying was invented?
 Larnth: Lol thanks, I'd joined long ago when there was only one problem
 Larnth: Now it seems there are many!
 eulerscheZahl: now everyone can upload their own problems with animations an all
 Wontonimo: no euler, that's not what I meant :smirk:

 jacek: 2048 is also pushing ui
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Astrobytes: Nightmare scenario
 eulerscheZahl: 1h long replays are fun to watch
 Westicles: beam search, eh?  you guys will all tie if it is beam search
 eulerscheZahl: the one with the cooking witches didn't have much variety in score points
 struct: I didnt enjoy that one too much
 struct: The last one was very good imo
 eulerscheZahl: from the recent ones i liked pacman the most
 Astrobytes: really? I hated that 
 eulerscheZahl: despite fog which i'm generally not a fan of: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i like it when i have to think out of the box and not throw a standard algo at it
 Astrobytes: that's fair
 eulerscheZahl: of course the last one wasn't just beam or MCTS either. but closer and with less own thinking IMO
 Scarfield: it did have some interesting strategies i think, never got into the probablities of where opponent pacs could be, but seemed interesting enough
 Astrobytes: ProbabilityField
 eulerscheZahl: Statsfield
 Scarfield: FairstroBytes
 Scarfield: e
 Astrobytes: haha
 Scarfield: im hoping for no fog of war tomorrow though
 struct: top 50 or delete
 Astrobytes: is that a threat?
 DomiKo: top10 or delete struct
 struct: thats harsh
 eulerscheZahl: i expect you to win a tshirt at least
 eulerscheZahl: you had your chance to beating mathis at clash. now it's the contest
 CommanderAzure: hi
 Astrobytes: top 15 or nulte gets deleted
 CommanderAzure: subscribe to sirswagger21
 Astrobytes: CommanderAzure: No.
 Scarfield: im hoping only 15 will compete then :p
 struct: Maybe I wont have to rewrite my bot multiple times
 Westicles: they should throw in a PS5 so that one guy will come back
 DomiKo: who?
 Westicles: oh, blaise deleted his video, I don't remember the name... deporan?
 ijc90: Im on shadow of the knight episode 2
 ijc90: any tips? currently stucked
 eulerscheZahl: you do remember it and just pretend you don't
 Scarfield: Mr. Last Minute
 eulerscheZahl: knight: binary search. first in x (keep y the same). then only move in y direction when you know x
 ijc90: Isn't it inneficient?
 ijc90: I figured going for both at the same time would be more efficient
 Westicles: ah, daporan
 ijc90: im trying to set conditions on 2d
 ijc90: but going one at a time is easier and might be enough
 ijc90: I'll try it tkz! 
 Scarfield: i seem to remember you have to do both at the same time?
 struct: nope
 Scarfield: lol i havent solved episode 2 xD
 ijc90: oohh
 Tryst: shadows of the knight is the only 2 part puzzle with an insane difficulty difference
 struct: insane?
 Tryst: well not insane
 struct: isnt it the same puzzle basicly?
 eulerscheZahl: because part 1 was that easy?
 Tryst: part 1 deserved to be an easy puzzle in my opinion
 eulerscheZahl: you have to get the idea to do x and y sequentially and not jump diagonally
 Tryst: yes
 eulerscheZahl: that's the hard part of it. coding is simple
 Tryst: fair
 eulerscheZahl: and you can't jump out of the grid, so you can't always split the interval in half
 struct: Well its what I would try first
 Scarfield: thats the biggest give away i have seen you do e
 eulerscheZahl: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: you are right, i spoiled the fun
 eulerscheZahl: #de is getting active, someone just wrote something :o

 Westicles: uh oh, java coffee cup about to get cancelled in the forum
 Astrobytes: you don't 'code games'
 eulerscheZahl: new drama?
 SchawnnahJ: okay
 Scarfield: tbh if you are completely new to coding SchawnnahJ, there are better sites to get the absolute basics down. this site is better suited when you at least know a little about your language of choice. its great though to learn and improve then

 Astrobytes: Yes.
 Astrobytes: Well, sufficiently.
 eulerscheZahl: we'll see. he didn't even pick the author
 eulerscheZahl: ping*
 Astrobytes: knew what you meant&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I demand you remove your balls. Why stereotype in this way?
 Astrobytes: (couldn't resist)
 jacek: balls
 Wontonimo: hehe
 jacek: hmm.
 Westicles: hey, we broke it
 jacek: :taco: derjack
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry jacek but you can only award tacos once per day
 Wontonimo: nope, updates at the request of another mod
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: People power!
 Uljahn: :unamused:
 Uljahn: those damn mods
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: badword
 Wontonimo: that and "badword" has been removed.  It was my test word.  I'm kinda sad to see it go 
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: excited for tomorrow?
 Wontonimo: oh, you beat me to it
 Wontonimo: is tomorrow the contest?  I kinda forgot until I saw it in the chat
 Astrobytes: Yes!
 eulerscheZahl: you are a good mod then. none that would just quit over less contests
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: honestly, I'm kinda feeling dread thinking about the work involved&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: so, no, not in a good headspace
 Astrobytes: nah, it's fun
 Wontonimo: no.1 or delete eh?
 Astrobytes: trick is to not take it too seriously, just enjoy it
 Wontonimo: exactly!  thanks for the reminder actually
 jacek: and your browser will crash from all that moderating
 Astrobytes: but the competition will get you :smiling_imp:
 eulerscheZahl: we are in it to win it
 Wontonimo: i think i need to disable tacos for the next couple days
 eulerscheZahl: yes, please
 Wontonimo: just moderation 
 Astrobytes: Possibly a good idea, yep
 eulerscheZahl: no chat flooding with taocs
 Astrobytes: or tacos
 Wontonimo: I'm going to do it now that I remember ...
 eulerscheZahl:  ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 jacek: stacocats
 Astrobytes:   on form this evening euler
 eulerscheZahl: did you add a trailing space to be more readable?
 Astrobytes: leading
 Astrobytes:  leading
 eulerscheZahl: right
 Astrobytes:   I always do that when you 
 eulerscheZahl: time to go to bed and accept defeat at topcoder
 Astrobytes: where did you end up?
 eulerscheZahl: sad times, i'm just not good that those CPU heavy games
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/FUhEyTB.png">https://i.imgur.com/FUhEyTB.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: still 1.5 hours to go
 Astrobytes:  not terrible. And we'll see what Mr Hidey-hidey does
 eulerscheZahl: i think his score a few days ago was about the same as my current one
 eulerscheZahl: but he's a strong player and definitely capable of improving
 Astrobytes: Oh right yeah, worth less as it goes on. 
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure
 eulerscheZahl: i still want to know a provisional score of CatalinT before i go to bed
 eulerscheZahl: he just joined the contest, no score yet
 eulerscheZahl: and he's the current topcoder marathon champion
 Astrobytes: Hm, well, that says something
 eulerscheZahl: a few contests ago he tried that late submit too. and failed miserably
 eulerscheZahl: the bouncing balls marathon
 Astrobytes: Which one?
 Astrobytes: Oh right
 eulerscheZahl: not even trying to trigger the chat bot
 MSmits: hi guys
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits!
 Uljahn: :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: contest tomorrow, mark it in your calendar
 nickromero: guys
 MSmits: I'm definitely joining contest yes. Won't be chatting much though. But will make lots of time for coding. Perhaps toward the end of the contest I'll join the chat if I am out of ideas.
 Astrobytes: as per usual :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have 2 other contests lined up during CG&#160;:(
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, sometimes i run out of ideas sooner, depends.
 Wontonimo: :taco: Wontonimo
 nickromero: guys idk how to code 
 Wontonimo: hi antiwonto
 Astrobytes: oh when's the google one?
 Wontonimo: oh, it ded
 eulerscheZahl: sunday evening codejam 1B
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl perhaps this helps with you running out of motivation for 1 contest and then going back to the other. Better than playing for 3-4 days and then just stopping
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Wontonimo. I'm a bot :robot:
 Astrobytes: Right, have to remember to make time for that. not like I was staying up for 1A
 Hjax: hi everyone&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: there we go
 Wontonimo: :taco: Hjax
 Wontonimo: should be no response.
 Wontonimo: great
 Astrobytes: Hjax! welcome back&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: okay, no tacos till some future date
 a-Rye: nickromero try Activities -&gt; Learn
 Astrobytes: post-contest&#160;;)
 MSmits: I think I may have lured another AI enthousiast to CG
 jacek: oO
 Hjax: as usual ive returned for the contest :P im actually between jobs as of friday so maybe ill be able to give this one a good attempt 
 Astrobytes: oh nice!
 MSmits: a guy I play a casual browser strategy game with turned out to be an AI/ML student
 Wontonimo: basically all antiwonto does now is badwords, lmgtfy, and clash links
 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO: hi everyone
 Wontonimo: oh nice one MSmits
 MSmits: I said his life would not be complete without trying CG
 jacek: casual browser strategy game?
 Astrobytes: MSmits: good stuff!! Which game?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://solaris.games">https://solaris.games</a>
 MSmits: very abstract strategy game, free
 jacek: ok, time to write bot for it
 Astrobytes: I've seen that, never played it
 jacek: looks like platinum rift
 eulerscheZahl: does he have a CG handle to look for already?
 MSmits: I think so
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: no 
 MSmits: i meant i gave him mine
 AlekseiIvanov: are you ready for the challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: almost
 eulerscheZahl: will join a day late
 MSmits: I will be more active after the first 24 hrs, but will try to get out of wood for a few hrs
 Joe0: wow i just got a clash of code in 14 seconds
 MSmits: have 1 more workday, then 2 week soff
 VizGhar: day late is fine... I can only imagine the site performance tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: thursday evening is reserved for soccer
 jacek: :notebook:
 MSmits: i dont mind if the site is slow for a day or so. It's a long challenge so that's ok
 jacek: why saying soccer where its called football
 eulerscheZahl: so that you don't confuse it with rugby-like sports
 eulerscheZahl: you can argue about soccer vs football but you surely know what i refer to
 MSmits: i think jacek means that rugby-like sports should be renamed to rugby
 eulerscheZahl: and that's the important part
 MSmits: actually, I think jacek is just trolling :P
 Astrobytes: well, not THAT particular 'football' game. Nothing to do with rugby other than the shape of the ball (roughly)
 eulerscheZahl: language is just a tool. i'd call it wiffwaff if we would previously agree on the meaning of that word
 Astrobytes: ^ I like that
 MSmits: +1 on wiffwaff
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: jacek, football is now wiffwaff
 Astrobytes: so from now on, wiffwaff refers to soccer/football that you kick
 MSmits: I still have paper wiffwaff on my list btew
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uix9kXIMVRM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uix9kXIMVRM</a>
 Astrobytes: weird English people
 RandomSteve: what about instead of soccer we call it if player 1 coords &gt;  player 2 coords || event.goal == true do event.win
 RandomSteve: that's how Javanian people would call it
 RandomSteve: sorta
 Hjax: its been a bit since ive been here, seems my rank hasnt totally collapsed yet 
 Hjax: my othello submission seems to be maintaining a decent rank
 Astrobytes: it's not based on clashes, so you're relatively safe Hjax&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: same Hjax. dropped a bit during inactivity but not completely
 Hjax: me and you are in different galaxies rank wise though euler 
 jacek: othello? so last week
 eulerscheZahl: because i invested more time, not because i'm smarter
 Hjax: othello was fun, it was my first rust project and first time implemented MCTS 
 Hjax: whats the current hotness? i do want to try chess at some point 
 Astrobytes: don't ask us, we're relative strangers here these days
 jacek: no particular hotness. apparently dark knight puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: looks like CatalinT failed with his late topcoder submit. i'm off to bed, see you
 Astrobytes: lol, goodnight euler
 Hjax: i come back and see the same people that were here when i left, but apparently you all took breaks too
 Hjax: gn euler
 Astrobytes: quite a few of us yes
 jacek: i was on the chat the whole time, but no particular project
 jacek: well, back to neuroevolution attempts last few dyas
 Astrobytes: you're still working on SR?
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: any luck with it now?
 jacek: better luck
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 jacek: my alt had 14k before, now its 12.3k
 RandomSteve: dark knight puzzles hard fr
 RandomSteve: but fun
 jacek: and with incest is wincest crossover it converges few times faster
 Astrobytes: "incest is wincest" hahaha, succinctly described
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/kdnurf">https://streamable.com/kdnurf</a> the before last checkpoint divergence is fun
 jacek: crossover for NN sucks because of permutations. you can do it safely on the NN with common ancestor
 Astrobytes: hehehe it's definitely improved from the last time I saw it
 jacek: it much faster recovers from going in circles
 Astrobytes: yeah that makes sense
 DerekHuangSoFunny: bro yall are nerds luhmao
 DerekHuangSoFunny: learn to code
 DerekHuangSoFunny: gg ez
 Astrobytes: Uh... yeah
 DerekHuangSoFunny: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: :joy: 
 Hjax: people who program for fun.... competitively?
 Hjax: no way 
 Hjax: couldnt be 
 Astrobytes: It's a character trait I treasure rather deeply!
 DomiKo: competing is so much fun
 DerekHuangSoFunny: how about you code your way into some womens dms
 nickromero: i coded my ai wife
 Wontonimo: I thought we were all women
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Wontonimo: isn't this a Woman only site?
 Astrobytes: Um... you think coding and getting a partner are mutually exclusive?
 Wontonimo: oh, like a friend
 Astrobytes: DereksNotSoFunny
 Wontonimo: I'm guessing my kick boot and ban hammer will get a lot more use over the next week
 Astrobytes: trolling coders about coding on a coding website seems like a tragic pastime 
 Wontonimo: gotta dust them off
 Hjax: astro werent you a mod at some point
 Wontonimo: the way wasn't good enough
 Wontonimo: *pay
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Nip them in the bud earlier rather than later and it'll save you a lot of effort
 Astrobytes: and lol
 Wontonimo: sage advice
 jacek: Hjax he didnt get a raise so he quit
 Astrobytes: Hjax: Yeah, euler, Ille, Neuman n and I resigned.
 Hjax: oh? for what reason?
 Wontonimo: I joined
 Wontonimo: just not enough space for all of us
 MSmits: I wasn't even considered
 MSmits: :cry:
 Astrobytes: Lack of contests, direction of CG etc.. just different outlooks. Nothing terrible and it was amicable.
 RandomSteve: is there a single woman in this website?
 Astrobytes: Quite a few, yes.
 MSmits: do you mean 1 woman, or a woman that is unattached
 Wontonimo: you weren't considered for free labour.  They must have thought you were more valuable MSmits
 RandomSteve: lol one woman
 MSmits: oh right, that makes sense Wontonimo
 Hjax: i see, yeah i was pretty disappointed by the (lack of) fall contest last year 
 Wontonimo: drop the gender talk RandomSteve
 Hjax: which is a big part of why i havent been around
 Wontonimo: that's first and last warning
 BoldMystery_df06: power&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hjax: same for a lot of us
 MSmits: not my reason really, I was just busy with other stuff in my life. I like the arena's better than the contests anyway
 RandomSteve: ok just what exactly you want me to drop?
 RandomSteve: be more specific?
 Astrobytes: Other than the past few months I'm still popping in for a chat and do a few bits here and there though. And I am motivated to do some more things after the contest now. 
 MSmits: RandomSteve talking about who is what gender is not really a coding conversation and often leads to unpleasant conversation
 MSmits: though it does not have to
 Hjax: im not sure how busy ill be with my new job, probably pretty busy though, but at least ill have free time for the contest 
 RandomSteve: ok then
 MSmits: we also don't do religion and politics and such
 Astrobytes: Congrats on the new job, something quite different?
 Astrobytes: @Hjax
 Hjax: yeah its at Google actually, so kind of a big upgrade 
 MSmits: nice!
 Astrobytes: eyyy :clap:
 Astrobytes: congrats sir
 jacek: youll be recaptcha bot?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 RandomSteve: what if I need to talk about a clash problem that contains "n men have n women each, each woman has n children"? (which actually exists)
 Hjax: thanks&#160;:) i wasnt expecting to get the job but i figured it didnt hurt to try 
 MSmits: RandomSteve that is fine
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave also interviewed with Google
 Wontonimo: use your judgement.  you'll know quickly if you judged wrong
 Hjax: i interviewed there out of college and completely bombed the interview
 Hjax: i think covid helped me, since their famed whiteboard coding interviews are now remote in a google doc
 Astrobytes: good training for the next one
 Hjax: being able to interview from home certainly helped me be less nervous 
 Astrobytes: haha nice, take a lil pressure off
 MSmits: feels like I got a bit of a promotion at work too. Am full CS teacher now, dont do anything else atm. Only have 1 colleague teaching CS that only works 2 days. So I mostly make the decisions and such now
 Astrobytes: You'll have to change nick to Hjax [EvilCorp] now though, you do realise :P
 Hjax: lol
 Wontonimo: nice MSmits&#160;!
 Hjax: more power to compel your students to play contests smits? P
 Astrobytes: MSmits: that's awesome man, it's definitely your second calling!
 Hjax: :P
 MSmits: definitely is yeah&#160;:) I would like to make them do contests
 MSmits: but most will not be good enough. It's not a matter of time, but mostly talent i think
 MSmits: we often forget here what a tiny selective group we are
 Astrobytes: Willingness to learn too
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's very true
 Wontonimo: it's hard to soar with the eagles when you are cooped up with the turkeys 
 MSmits: that too, but when they have talent they are usually easy to motivate to try it
 Astrobytes: Yep, also very true
 Westicles: I'll make a clash about eating glue for them
 MSmits: but i always have 1 or 2 in a class that could do the CG thing
 Darleanow: hello wonto&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: :wave: 
 Astrobytes: Westicles: heh
 MSmits: I had a 13 yr old girl code a hangman program in python the other day, was pretty impressed
 MSmits: it's good practice, 50 or so lines not counting ascii pictures
 Hjax: well the nice thing about CG is its accessible, a relative beginner can at least tweak the starter code and see some visible improvement in wood league 
 Wontonimo: hmm ... better check the vocabuulary in the game to see if it is secretly a hit list of people
 MSmits: lol
 Wontonimo: "hey, why is my name in there 15 times?"
 MSmits: Hjax yeah but I find the initial barrier to understanding is the starter code. Trying to understand the input/output structure and the game loop
 MSmits: once you get that, you can play easily
 Hjax: thats fair, maybe i have the curse of knowledge at this point from doing it too much 
 MSmits: i might put a tutorial in  one of my CS courses that eases them through it with some puzzles and maybe an easy multi
 Astrobytes: weirdly, way back when I started on CG I had no issue with the i/o
 MSmits: you were a good coder then I think?
 Hjax: ive always found that difficult when explaining coding concepts to others, ill forget to explain something that seems trivial to me and then they stumble on it 
 Wontonimo: i've been helping "beginners" here, and I've come to the conclusion that the multis are not for beginners.  Someone has to have mastered loops and arrays and have some basic algebra knowledge to do much at all, even in wood
 MSmits: thats exactly the amount of knowledge my students have
 VizGhar: You dont have to be good coder... Most of devs starts coding with standard i/o right?
 a-Rye: Yea, CG isn't for beginners. I'm still working on my Python playground to get anyone caught up to speed to at least clash
 Astrobytes: especially if the recommended beginner multi is CSB...
 MSmits: VizGhar i guess i mean the python starter code. It's not very clear
 MSmits: the way the input is split and read all at once
 Wontonimo: haha ... but physics is so intuitive right?  Everyone knows about friction and vectors
 VizGhar: hmm...
 Hjax: i still am of the opinion that the best beginner multi is cyborg uprising (formerly ghost in the shell?) 
 VizGhar: yeah physics might be a problem
 Wontonimo: that was sarcasm VizGhar
 MSmits: ahh that one is good yeah Hjax
 Hjax: because of how simple the game is to understand 
 MSmits: was one of the first ones i played
 MSmits: game of drones is easy too
 Hjax: i havent played it here, but i played planet wars in the google ai challenge back in the day when i was first learning to program
 Hjax: basically the same game 
 VizGhar: I understood Wonto I was reacting to Smits
 Wontonimo: I've been recommending connect 4 and tron because of the small variation of input and something a bit random but in the right way can do alright-ish
 struct: onitama is the best one
 Wontonimo: i still haven't started that one 
 VizGhar: onitama isn't for beginners
 jacek: onitama is too easy
 VizGhar: i mean for absolute beginners
 Astrobytes: I still think a 'kindergarten' section would be useful here
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: with regular TTT and such like, for practicing algorithms and whatnot
 jacek: here you go <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/kindergarten/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/kindergarten/space-maze</a>
 VizGhar: :D
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Hjax: lol
 Astrobytes: I mean, I know you can do playgrounds on techio etc but it would be more motivational (perhaps?) for those just getting started beyond basic puzzles
 VizGhar: Yeah, kindergarten sounds fun... once you reach "bronze league"  you will be removed from leaderboard...
 VizGhar: and you can go to elementary school of AI development
 Astrobytes: ...you mean 'Achieve Mastery' surely
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: But yeah, exactly that 
 VIPERR: any idea for a first personal project&#160;?
 jacek: web?
 Astrobytes: Browser-based GTA V clone
 struct: I would make a language
 Astrobytes: bit of a vague question&#160;;)
 VizGhar: VIPERR button icrements counter
 VizGhar: or something like google, if you want to retire rich
 jacek: height calculator <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://preview.redd.it/k85i38apisi51.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e54e74fae0ddb894a974ae9bbdd297eb104c7768">https://preview.redd.it/k85i38apisi51.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=e54e74fae0ddb894a974ae9bbdd297eb104c7768</a>
 Astrobytes: :D
 VizGhar: omg jacek who raised you?
 struct: the internet
 Astrobytes: VIPERR: depends what level you're at I guess
 VizGhar: mastery of sarcasm achieved
 Wontonimo: VIPERR , make something like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/">https://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/</a>
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Illedan: :wave:
 Wontonimo: or add to it and send me a pull request
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: (I haven't forgotten btw Wontonimo)
 Astrobytes: hey Illedan
 Illedan: Hi
 jacek: ready for a contest?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: I need to fix the Cookie thing that was added last year
 Wontonimo: what's that?
 Astrobytes: the login cookie thing
 Westicles: you can look at the python script for number shifting, euler updated it
 Illedan: To play games from a local script
 Wontonimo: oh, fancy.  things i haven't played with yet
 MSmits: number shifting is great because it teaches you dancing links. It's not at all the best algorithm for larger sizes, but I haven't seen other games where you can use it
 Illedan: Did you learn it?
 MSmits: yeah i used it there
 Illedan: I didn't quite understand it :P
 Illedan: nice
 MSmits: you get stuck at 200 something, i think 230 or so
 struct: Maybe you will need it for the next contest :zipper_mouth:
 MSmits: it doesnt scale well after that
 jacek: then you will need the dancing sort
 MSmits: hard to say, are you a tester for the contest struct?
 Illedan: :eyes:
 Astrobytes: you didn't actually watch that Knuth lecture though surely
 struct: no
 VIPERR: thanks for the ideas
 MSmits: Astrobytes i dont know if i watched the whole thing, but i did watch part of it at least
 Astrobytes: So did I, about 10 minutes
 MSmits: once he got past the disconnecting and reconnecting parts I kind of got it
 MSmits: it's really a pretty algorithm
 Astrobytes: I got the general idea but not fully in the slightest. Should spend some time on it
 MSmits: well only if you're interested in it. I havent' found uses beyond number shifting and Marchete kind of cracked that one 
 MSmits: it's supposedly good for sodoku and such
 Astrobytes: It was an interesting concept. Plus: Donald Knuth
 MSmits: true
 Westicles: you can use it for Shikaku Solver
 MSmits: yeah it's basically for some types of constraint satisfaction problems
 MSmits: we just dont have that many at CG
 Astrobytes: never say never&#160;:)
 MSmits: indeed
 techandfood: hello 
 Astrobytes: finished with Oware yet?
 MSmits: havent done the game vs professor X yet, they are really slow in communication
 MSmits: but I think I may be able to solve it now, given more time
 MSmits: found some new tricks for that
 Astrobytes: was that the competition stones thingy?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: I signed up for that but got no response /shrug
 jacek: hm
 MSmits: well i got a response after over a month
 Astrobytes: maybe they take 1 at a time
 blasterpoard: FYI I just checked for how many milliseconds before the time limit you need to end the turn to not risk timeouts... it looks like the number will be 16 for this contest
 MSmits: yeah maybe Astrobytes
 MSmits: blasterpoard how do you know
 MSmits: 16 seems a lot
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/620838588">https://www.codingame.com/replay/620838588</a> 3 bots printing out maximum difference between two subsequent measurement of time
 blasterpoard: this was the biggest number I found
 blasterpoard: 15.896
 MSmits: ah yeah i did tests like this before a long time ago. In CSB
 MSmits: was between 5 and 8 ms at its worst
 Astrobytes: not sure that's a valid assumption tbh. Too many weird factors.
 blasterpoard: it was 24 for century spice road
 MSmits: they did say they reduced the problem, so i dont know whats wrong now blasterpoard
 Astrobytes: Yeah, exactly that MSmits, The Spikes
 blasterpoard: so yes, it is reduced
 MSmits: what is century spice road
 Astrobytes: Site is currently slow overall and they've been updating languages
 Astrobytes: MSmits the witch one
 MSmits: oh that one
 MSmits: the one i skipped
 Astrobytes: iirc
 blasterpoard: century spice road = fall 2020
 MSmits: this was before the one with the trees right?
 MSmits: I was in that one
 blasterpoard: yes
 Astrobytes: it was the one with the witches and the potions/spells
 MSmits: right yeah
 MSmits: it reminded me of code4life
 MSmits: I just did the wood leagues I think
 Astrobytes: never really made an effort at c4l
 BoldUselessDragon: im new
 NewCoder09: need help with anything?
 MSmits: me neither astro. it just reminded me because of the recipe thing
 jacek: btw. happy 4/20 MSmits
 Wontonimo: but it is only 4:12pm&#160;?
 Wontonimo: oh ... it'll be 4/20 4/20 in 8 min!
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef7e481f-76ee-4d4a-86ad-c6ff10d09210">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef7e481f-76ee-4d4a-86ad-c6ff10d09210</a>
 Astrobytes: and it's 20/4 here actually so...
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: how did I miss that the whole day is 4/20&#160;!
 Astrobytes: disc golf, tacos and spliffs at wonto's place in 6 minutes everyone :D
 MSmits: you spend too much time waving the ban hammer around here. Have to look up every once in a while and smell the weed
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 jacek: weed breaks memory
 NewCoder09: in an hour and 5 mins it wil be 4/20 4/20 for me
 Astrobytes: I can't smoke the stuff they produce these days
 Astrobytes: THC/CBD ratio too far off
 Astrobytes: theoretically speaking, not that such things have ever been ingested here
 Astrobytes: I prefer Bicycle Day anyway.

 Illedan: Any good guesses on the contest?
 Astrobytes: only struct and jacek had any iirc
 Illedan: Opim dis
 Astrobytes: Or ofc, the hex torus

 TobiasA: that bicycle race is actually lit
 TobiasA: *song
 Astrobytes: first time you heard it?
 a-Rye:  🦆🦆🦆Happy 4/20🦆🦆🦆
 MSmits: TobiasA that's common sense. Otherwise you'll dive off a cliff on the first turn
 Astrobytes: why ducks?
 a-Rye: why not? I would do rubber ducks if I had them lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 TobiasA: yup that's the first time
 a-Rye: Personally, I talk to a red octopus figurine
 Astrobytes: Soul Cake Ducks
 Astrobytes: TobiasA: Queen were an amazing band dude
 Astrobytes: MSmits: :grin:
 TobiasA: i'm listening to their songs
 TobiasA: bohemian rhapsody:cold_sweat:
 Wontonimo: done before autotune ... that guy could sing
 dermalm: hey, does anyone know how to continue playing the clash as if it would be a normal puzzle?
 Astrobytes: Montserrat Caballé agreed
 Darleanow: codingame rly do be thinking im an ai
 Wontonimo: no can do dermalm
 Darleanow: being an ai, id be disapointed to be compared with such a stupid human
 Astrobytes: Darleanow: clashing too much?
 Wontonimo: you arn't artificial to me
 a-Rye: dermalm you can find the clashes here, but it's tricky:

 Astrobytes: ^ that one&#160;;)
 a-Rye: ...ah, yes that one lol
 a-Rye: hey, I said it was tricky
 Astrobytes: :D
 a-Rye: I blame the ducks
 Astrobytes: Absolutely :D
 Darleanow: Astrobytes indeed xD
 Darleanow: I NEED TOP 1000
 a-Rye: I was close, like 1200 or something. I'll get back to clashing after I get my Beginner Java Concepts playground somewhat decent 
 Astrobytes: do a puzzle or something in between every few clashes to break it up a bit
 Darleanow: Astrobytes ill just complete captchas lol&#160;:)
 Darleanow: id like to be before tomorro
 Darleanow: tomorrow
 Darleanow: ive been spending way too much time on grinding
 Astrobytes: lol, you clash addicts are determined, I'll give you that :D
 Darleanow: ahhah
 a-Rye: I mean, I got my 500 clash legendary badge...so not so determined anymore lol
 Karton47: I've had an awfully long break from coding on sites like this. Solving the simplest tasks is a pain&#160;:/.
 Darleanow: is there anonym clashers meetings&#160;?
 a-Rye: and I'm down to 1600 something
 Astrobytes: Karton47: start slow and easy, it'll come back
 Astrobytes: Darleanow: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: Quite possibly
 Karton47: @Astrobytes thanks for your kind words
 Darleanow: and i'm on only hard ones
 jacek: star with easy puzzles then
 Darleanow: just lost 200 ranks lool
 Papa647: Can i change theme to dark?
 Astrobytes: settings, gear icon below this chat
 Papa647: &lt;3
 Astrobytes: alrighty, I'm outta here for tonight. See you all for the contest tomorrow
 Wontonimo: bye bye
 Hjax: gn astro
 a-Rye: night
 peerdb: gonna be fun to see the servers crash when the contest launches
 SandmanSW96: wow the event thinks its Tuesday the 19th in Arizona :laughing:
 SandmanSW96: we just legalized recreational weed here last year, we know DAMN well what day 4-20 is...
 Illedan: Done with the Cookie. Now I'm ready
 Illedan: Anyone have a smooth implemented bitstream?
 Illedan: in C#
 Illedan: Or Java or C++ or any reasonable language
 SandmanSW96: not familiar with bitstreams
 a-Rye: I understand 4-20 and cookies, but am too at a loss with bitstreams 
 jacek: java bitstream? like apache commons or some other guava's
 Illedan: I want something similar to what reCurs e did years ago. 
 Illedan: The lazy way
 Illedan: But I guess I'm soon done making it anyway :P
 jacek: bitstream for what? for uploading nn weights?
 Illedan: Running CG games from a local setup and using the error prints for something reasonable to debug and extract information
 Illedan: Anyway, off to bed. cya tomorrow at contest
 jacek: winter wrap up winter wrap up ~
 peerdb: I can't wait for the contest to start
 peerdb: im so excited

 zakacat: take taco
 JohnCM: haha top 1000 is very possible for clash of code, just play often and try not to get below 50% of the participants
 TheMassiveCarnivore_9980: I'm new here. Is this a good platform to get jobs?
 TheMassiveCarnivore_9980: lol this name
 LeoLovesGaming: dont get it
 weebiss: :I
 memekongu: hello everyone
 Topjimmies: how much of a handicap is using python instead of c++ for the contest?
 struct: depends on the type of contest
 mybk: 95%
 Topjimmies: what about lua?
 struct: is lua faster than python?
 Topjimmies: yes
 struct: In terms of performance not many will match c++
 struct: maybe rust
 struct: C# might get close
 dev0x: or go
 struct: you will still need to right fast code though
 struct: but I would not worry too much about it
 struct: I have bots that perform close to the same strength with 1/10 of the sims
 Wontonimo: Topjimmies , python is fine
 struct: yeah
 struct: it all depends on the goal
 struct: for rank 1 I will say its not
 struct: :p
 struct: Are you joining the contest Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: but less than 500 people will ever reach numbe r1
 Wontonimo: I think I will.  Astrobytes cheered me on and gave some good advice
 Wontonimo: just enjoy it, don't get serious
 struct: is that your advice?
 Wontonimo: no, Astros
 struct: I see
 struct: my goal is top 50
 struct: I think I placed 41 on the previous one
 Wontonimo: awesome&#160;!  Go go&#160;!
 struct: Only top 20 gets a tshirt
 struct: its hard
 Wontonimo: my goal is top 50%
 struct: I'm sure you will able to do it
 Wontonimo: I don't have any time off for this one and my son is coming home from Uni right in the middle of it, then I have to go to a funeral in another province a couple days after that. 
 Wontonimo: so, i'm swamped
 struct: Is it your first contest?
 Wontonimo: did you take any time off for this or otherwise open yourr schedule?  It would be my second
 struct: time of
 struct: fof
 struct: off*
 struct: my goal for this contest will be to spend less time on it
 struct: If I spend too much time I end up doing nothing usefull
 Wontonimo: yeah, i hear that.  I did a lot of submit-stare-submit-tinker-submit last time
 Wontonimo: have you been practicing, getting ready?  I haven't touched C++ for months.  Don't even remember how to get the profiler running 
 struct: nope
 struct: I havent coded c++ for a while
 struct: maybe 1 month?
 Wontonimo: is that what you are going to use most likely?  or are you one of the C# converts&#160;?
 struct: I would not worry too much about profiling in contests
 struct: nah ill use c++
 struct: but my c++ is basic stuff
 Wontonimo: the last contest came right after I dug deep into uttt, so it was all fresh on my mind
 struct: Use w/e you are most confortable with
 struct: if you are enjoying the contest then switch
 struct: c++ is not magic
 Wontonimo: yeah, of course.  I didn't even use mcts for the tree planting contest
 struct: I tried mcts but didnt think it would work
 Wontonimo: everyone used beam that go into legend.  i used plain MC 
 struct: ended up using chokudai search
 struct: yeah
 Wontonimo: chokudia&#160;?  never heard of it
 struct: beam search with dynamic beam width
 struct: While you have time you increase the beam width
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/57902/totoro-beam-search-c-starter">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/57902/totoro-beam-search-c-starter</a>
 Wontonimo: got it.  nice
 Wontonimo: I meat to go back and redo it with beam for the practice
 struct: well we dont know yet what the contest is
 struct: maybe MC can perform well
 Wontonimo: in the last competition I went in it with thinking I'd just watch, maybe make a dumb if/else bot.  
 Wontonimo: just goes to show
 struct: I cant make if else bots
 struct: Dont know why I always struggle with it
 Wontonimo: I get beam.  it's pretty straight forward.  It's getting it optimized and balanced
 Wontonimo: really?
 struct: well at least for ghost in the cell
 struct: the cyborg one
 struct: where you go from planet to planet
 struct: I never managed to make an AI there
 Wontonimo: yeah
 struct: But I didnt spend too much time on it
 Wontonimo: I studied the highest ranked bots for hours, made spread sheets, looked for trends, heuristics.  It took many hours
 struct: tbf
 struct: which bots Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: for Totoro
 struct: ah from replays
 Wontonimo: yeah
 struct: well most of the time I add features to the eval
 struct: until it plays better
 struct: it doesnt work everytime though
 Wontonimo: for sure
 Wontonimo: it's hard
 Wontonimo: and hit/miss
 Wontonimo: I liked Totoro.  Is it a game you can buy.  It seems fun.
 struct: yeah
 struct: It was a good contest
 struct: I hope this one can match it
 Wontonimo: or is it only loosely based on the board game
 struct: its based on it
 Wontonimo: so, some thing with Totoro I noticed were things like 
 zxc_school: hi
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: the number of trees and size per round
 Wontonimo: hi zxc_school
 Wontonimo: another one was that seeds were rarely dropped beside your own tree in the high ranks
 Wontonimo: my if/else got to well into gold
 Wontonimo: and i heard tale that some people were able to get into legend with if/else .  I think that's cool
 struct: wow
 Wontonimo: there will probably be way more NNs this time
 Wontonimo: i still haven't made a NN harness for cg
 struct: hmm im not sure
 struct: its only 10 days I think
 Wontonimo: yeah, not enough time to make the harness and compete
 Wontonimo: well, it's late here.  I'm heading off.  Good luck with the contest&#160;!  Hope you make it to the top 10
 struct: gn

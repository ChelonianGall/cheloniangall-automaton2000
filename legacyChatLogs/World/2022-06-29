 hejamandajiri: I'm sorry wrong place
 derjack: :rage:
 derjack: another french feature puzzle :thinking:
 Westicles: zut alors
 Westicles: At this point I think it is some kind of subtle civil disobedience 
 JGXIANG: :grinning:
 struct: so optimization with sharing?
 derjack: oh its an optim. is this first featured optim?
 struct: maybe I think there was a potw optim
 struct: where you just had to submit
 struct: but I dont think it was an event
 derjack: 2048 was potw
 struct: yeah but it was before events I think
 struct: I'm not sure
 derjack: eeyup
 Crosility: Oooh, a new puzzle
 wlesavo: i think NS and SR were potw also, before the events
 wlesavo: wait, best solution revealed for an optim? thats doesnt feel right
 5DN1L: [CG]Thibaud what do you think?
 derjack: Automaton2000 what do you think?
 Automaton2000: hey, does anyone know how to continue
 struct: I don't dislike sharing solutions.
 derjack: optim is competition
 struct: I would share any of my bots
 derjack: feature bot programming would also reveal best bot?
 struct: But I would not share it with every1
 wlesavo: well it is ok to share, but share publicly is just ruining the game for everyone who will be plaing it after the event 
 Crosility: Maybe it won't be here after?
 Crosility: Or will be tweaked?
 Razovsky: hi, can someone give me the parameters of testcase 9 of this puzzle 
 Razovsky: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/a-childs-play">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/a-childs-play</a>
 Razovsky: somehow i don't validate it, i don't understand 
 5DN1L: same as test 9 except second input
 derjack: oh, eulers site is down
 Razovsky: thx all
 salvation2022: Brothers, how can we make this web page Chinese? 
 Razovsky: what
 derjack: add opening books
 salvation2022: CodinGame how to Chinese web page?
 Aldoggen: language is based on your location
 struct: You can't 
 Aldoggen: I'm stuck with french and I don't llke it
 struct: only French and english
 5DN1L: Aldoggen you can change the language in settings
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/settings">https://www.codingame.com/settings</a>
 wlesavo: and in the bottom of the main page
 Aldoggen: I meant french in the chat, but if codingame only supports english and french, maybe everyone has that chat?
 Aldoggen: in that case I'll stop mentioning it :p
 Aldoggen: thanks for the help though!
 5DN1L: you can /leave fr
 Aldoggen: :o
 Aldoggen: "You cannot leave this channel."
 Aldoggen: lmao
 5DN1L: oh
 5DN1L: never heard of that before :joy:
 5DN1L: should i try /leave world&#160;?
 Aldoggen: if it doesn't work with fr I doubt it will with world
 Aldoggen: lemme see
 Aldoggen: nope
 derjack: you cant leave france? :scream:
 Aldoggen: welp, guess I'm also stuck in france now
 5DN1L: and in your settings page is English or French selected?
 Aldoggen: english
 5DN1L: how interesting
 Aldoggen: so the website itself is in english
 5DN1L: i wonder if some people face the same issue as you
 5DN1L: never heard of such an issue before
 Aldoggen: probably everyone in belgium
 Aldoggen: maybe everyone in canada
 salvation2022: How to set Chinese in the home page
 Aldoggen: I mean, for about half the people in belgium it's not an issue, since they speak french
 5DN1L: salvation2022, just like how you translate other webpages
 5DN1L: no settings here

 Darleanow: Hello&#160;!!
 struct: hi
 Darleanow: guys i have a new clash&#160;!!
 Darleanow: I hope it will be better than the previous one x)
 Darleanow: How r u struct&#160;?
 struct: I'm alright, still a bit tired from the contest
 Darleanow: this was too hard imo xDD
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23247a50fa5d61440a2ee3203597a02a9aef8">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23247a50fa5d61440a2ee3203597a02a9aef8</a>

 Darleanow: which league have u reached so far struct&#160;?
 struct: I didnt make it past gold
 Darleanow: ow&#160;:/
 Darleanow: u'll do better next one&#160;!
 ~Gambit~: @struct I only managed to reach silver. i used mostly conditions. can u give some advice on how to approach card type contest. what kind of algo i should use
 struct: ~Gambit~ you could check the forum postmortems, I used brute force depth 1

 struct: You can check there what top players used
 ~Gambit~: ah ok. thnx
 struct: I tried all possible actions from move up to release
 struct: but at last day I decided to prune some actions and my bot dd better
 struct: still was not enough for legend
 ~Gambit~: need to improve myself for the next contest
 struct: play some bot programming games
 struct: to practice 
 struct: It should help
 ~Gambit~: yeah i started. currently doing tic-tac-toe one
 derjack:&#160;:+1:
 derjack: struct do you have a replay when top player use prio task with bonus card?
 struct: no, I was just trolling you
 struct: it might not be important at all
 derjack: phew
 struct: Was it too much work to add?
 derjack: dunno i didnt bother
 derjack: but maybe ill try adding my last action to inputs
 Darleanow: making my ad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23247a50fa5d61440a2ee3203597a02a9aef8">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23247a50fa5d61440a2ee3203597a02a9aef8</a>
 Darleanow: if some people could upvote/downvote depending on how it is&#160;:))
 Crosility: Idea is nice, wording is rough, commented a possible improvement.
 Aldoggen: +1 that
 Aldoggen: I'm commenting too
 Westicles: I really don't want to do this tennis puzzle.  Somebody tell me I can skip it
 Aldoggen: of course you can
 Westicles: many thanks
 derjack: no you cannot
 Westicles: :rage:
 Darleanow: thanks guys
 iGalixtic: yoo
 Aldoggen: yo
 Aldoggen: @Darleanow make sure to put a little more effort in your texts before you ask for feedback. You can do it, I know you can&#160;:)
 Darleanow: i'm sorry my english isn't really good&#160;:/
 AstaWisdom: yo 
 AstaWisdom: Anyone Tried this Block the spreading fire?
 Aldoggen: @Darleanow I'm glad to help with language mistakes, but you can make your structure much clearer.  Let me add something to my comment
 Darleanow: i'm doing what you told me to do&#160;!!
 Darleanow: and modified a bit my code&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I'll look at it in a minute&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: I think you still need to look at line 1 of the input section, and at the tests.
 Gangbi34567: hi guys
 Aldoggen: yo
 Gangbi34567: yo whats up bro
 Darleanow: but i added the n=0 case , and tried to clearify it 
 Darleanow: isnt it good&#160;?:o
 Crosility: Line 1: a number 'n' strings - or something. I upvoted however, IDE test was fine, matched new description.
 Crosility: It's easily enough to understand, and functions properly.
 Darleanow: nice&#160;!
 Aldoggen: @Darleanow oh, I'll refresh the page in a minute. still writing.
 Darleanow: aight man&#160;!
 Crosility: Thanks for contributing content Darleanow&#160;:]
 Crosility: I hope someday to as well.
 Darleanow: Thanks man&#160;!&#160;:)
 Darleanow: Of course that you can, if i can, you can&#160;!
 Crosility: I'd moderator CoC approve, but, need 50 CoC standoffs.
 Crosility: Nowhere near that yet though.
 HenroLST: dang, how become mod?
 Aldoggen: it's not really moderator, more like trusted user
 HenroLST: ah
 Aldoggen: and as Crosility said, 50 clash of code completions suffices
 Darleanow: fixed what u've said Aldoggen
 Aldoggen: I'll look at it
 Aldoggen: "Write a program that swaps upper or lowercase for a letter if it's ASCII value is even" do you mean if it's in an even position?
 vincent_manuceau: Hello guys here is the next Mooo CoC please approve if you like&#160;! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23248829c095cfff56805a6b6da99d2ac9f38">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23248829c095cfff56805a6b6da99d2ac9f38</a>
 Crosility: Sorry, yes Aldoggen, correct. Just the descriptor in the site states moderator. You achieve moderator (for approval means) status once you've done 50 CoC according to the quest tree.
 crass: anyone know if I can practice clash of code games by myself untimed?
 HenroLST: you could do puzzles instead, not sure if you can do coc untimed unless you go in a game, grab the problem and some test cases, then work on your own time
 crass: thanks
 HenroLST: np
 ThomasGottschalk: Gabi&gt;JÃ¼rg
 GNye22: Hey does anyone know what incrementing an empty list in python does?
 GNye22: ex: l = []  l+=1
 Aldoggen: wow, good question
 Aldoggen: can always try it out
 Aldoggen: I think it stays an empty list
 GNye22: is there a blank ide on the site? or do I have to go into an activity
 GNye22: And it obviously does something cuz this guy used it to count sequences
 Aldoggen: you can search python compiler online in your favourite search engine
 ThomasGottschalk: Gabi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
 Aldoggen: l = []l += 1gives me an error
 Aldoggen: you sure that's python code?
 ThomasGottschalk: gabi&lt;JÃ¼rg
 GNye22: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d74660f-643b-4224-883a-3d235f57083e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d74660f-643b-4224-883a-3d235f57083e</a>
 GNye22: ughhh pastebins are still broken???
 Aldoggen: apparently yep
 Aldoggen: copy paste it in private chat?
 GNye22: here: this is the source code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/c2bKK5JY">https://pastebin.com/c2bKK5JY</a>
 ThomasGottschalk: guys who do you more prefer gabi or jÃ¼rg
 GNye22: We take a sequence of characters and determine if its decreasing or increasing
 GNye22: and as soon as the sequence changes, we print the length of each sequence
 ThomasGottschalk: I say Gabi&gt;JÃ¼rg
 GNye22: so for example Cable = 2-2-1
 ThomasGottschalk: GUYS
 ThomasGottschalk: Gabi or JÃ¼rg
 ThomasGottschalk: decide
 Aldoggen: your mom
 Aldoggen: ok let me look at the pastebin
 Urutar: ThomasGottschalk, what are you talking about? Is it coding related?
 ThomasGottschalk: Yes they Gabi and JÃ¼rg are professional coders and I wanna know who the people think is better
 Urutar: Without more data to go on, that would be an entirely uninformed decision.
 Aldoggen: GNye22 I found it
 Aldoggen: he's adding a tuple to r
 lifetimeLearner007: n=32; print(n/(-n&amp;n)why is this same as n=32; while(n%2==0)n/=2; print(n);&#160;?
 Aldoggen: on lines 16 and 19 right?
 Aldoggen: there's a comma behind the 1 and 0
 eulerscheZahl: -n&amp;n: gets the last bit that's 1 in binary
 Loris_z30: hey gregory
 ThomasGottschalk: Hoi Loris
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. binary 1100101000 becomes 1000
 ThomasGottschalk: Loris Gabi or JÃ¼rg
 Loris_z30: what is a for schlaufe
 eulerscheZahl: every bit before is set to 0
 Loris_z30: i think gabi
 ThomasGottschalk: Same
 Loris_z30: you?
 ThomasGottschalk: Gabi Goat
 Loris_z30: no goat is jacko
 Uljahn: pls no flood here
 eulerscheZahl: if you need more input, switch to private message lifetimeLearner007 chat is getting too spammy here
 GNye22: Ok, im kind of new to python, so I thought tuples were like key,value pairs. So how does r+=1 add a tuple?
 Loris_z30: ou sorry
 Loris_z30: please dont hit me
 Aldoggen: there's a comma behind the integer literal
 Aldoggen: it's r += 1,
 Aldoggen: the comma acts as syntactic sugar
 ThomasGottschalk: Loris and I we are gay do you guys support and accept us
 Urutar: Neat :O
 Loris_z30: ThomasGottschalk thats not coding relevant
 Urutar: ThomasGottschalk, this is not at all coding related. Noone minds anyones orientation, but that does NOT belong here.
 Urutar: You can either chat privately, in a channel or coding related stuff here.
 Loris_z30: Urutar:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Aldoggen: that's arguably a feature that's more annoying than useful, but it becomes useful when you do things like x,y = y,x. this switches the values of x and y
 Loris_z30: cap
 GNye22: @Aldoggen ok, I'm still kinda confused
 Urutar: Neat things in python&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: just think of "1," as shorthand for tuple(1)
 Aldoggen: it's a bit too much for me
 Aldoggen: I'd rather have type safety
 Aldoggen: oh god I was inconsistent with using quotes
 GNye22: Ok, I guess it makes sense for now
 Aldoggen: aand tuple(1) gives syntax errors. tuple expects an iterable
 GNye22: I'm stepping through in the compiler
 Aldoggen: so I guess tuple([1])
 Uljahn: or just (1,)
 Aldoggen: well yeah&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: GNye22 in the case of "r += 1,", it's just the same as "r.append(1)".

 Astrobytes: Optim as weekly event? Revealing best solutions? ;o
 Astrobytes: :o
 eulerscheZahl: just randomly paste parts of the initial message
 eulerscheZahl: wait, let me check
 eulerscheZahl: the fire
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't even coded that one yet
 Astrobytes: nothing serious here either
 eulerscheZahl: i think it can be done as a flow algo to get an outline of where to cut. which you can then shrink
 eulerscheZahl: flow algo like i did on topcoder for the christmas elves
 Astrobytes: Yes that seems a plausible approach
 Astrobytes: Just make sure you hardcode it if you get a 'best solution' :P
 eulerscheZahl: will they really reveal it?
 derjack: wait till onitama will be featured event and best bot revealed
 eulerscheZahl: i mean i see it. but might be just bad UI
 Astrobytes: I suspect not, but it does still have the dates on the puzzle landing page
 Astrobytes: yeah
 wlesavo: i think this was not supposed to happen, but i hope it will be adressed at some point, I know in previous events you could see the different solutions even if you didn't solve the task, so not only the best solution is revealed but basically all of them
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we should warn CG and make sure it doesn't happen?
 eulerscheZahl: nah :popcorn:
 Westicles: there's no way to publish on an optim
 wlesavo: tibo was pinged here, but i think someone should mention it on discord
 Astrobytes: You never know... that publish button might just do something this time...
 eulerscheZahl: he once mentioned that chat pings don't work for him
 eulerscheZahl: might be the [ ] in the name
 Westicles:  only published solutions show
 eulerscheZahl: my publish button broke some months ago anyways
 wlesavo: Westicles oh right, that can save the situation
 eulerscheZahl: it's just not publishing anymore
 Westicles: 9/10 french now :P
 GNye22: Anyone know how clash of code score is calculated? it says you gain min(N,5000)^((N-c+1)/N), so by my calculations coming in first of a group of 8 should increase your score by 8, but it doesn't?
 chocolatecake: fjtwy
 Aldoggen: so after doing a game of CoC, your ranking (C) changes. then the score gets updated with the new C 
 Aldoggen: N is the total number of players that  have a rank in CoC
 Aldoggen: if this doesn't solve your problem we both need to be more clear
 Aldoggen: oh, I can add that the formula you pasted is (as I interpret it) the total amount of score you get. not the score that gets added
 GNye22: Ok, that makes sense, but for example right now my score is 18.16, but I placed first last game so wouldn't my score become 80 then based off of what you just said?
 GNye22: or is it calculated as an average between all your games?
 Westicles: that formula calculates your CP.  leaderboard rank has nothing to do with that
 eulerscheZahl: TrueSkill to update scores after each single clash
 Aldoggen: you getting placed first in your last game changes your place in the ranking of all players that played CoC. getting first doesn't mean you get to let C = 1.
 eulerscheZahl: in short winning gains you points and getting last costs you points. but it also depends on the rank of your opponents how much you gain
 Aldoggen: I mean getting first in ONE game doesn't mean you get to set C = 1. if you're first globally, then of course C = 1
 eulerscheZahl: the CP only updates once a day
 Aldoggen: I guess your confusion comes from the fact that there are kinds of rankings. each CoC has a ranking, where you can be 1/8 for example. CoC as a whole also has a ranking, and there you're currently 1892nd
 Aldoggen: and so C = 1892
 Aldoggen: that C goes into the formula you pasted, i.e. min(N,5000)^((N-c+1)/N) or whatever, and that formula determines the CoC part of your score
 GNye22: oohhhhhhh ok that makes sense now
 Aldoggen: glad I could be part of your aha-erlebnis&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: and once you get the coding points (from the formula) from CoC and the other things on codingame, you add them. that gives the total amount of coding points, which determines your global codingame rank (13286th for you)
 Nikanameu: does anyone have an offline training environment for mad pod racing?
 Aldoggen: probably
 Nikanameu: one to share with me
 Aldoggen: oof, don't know that one. maybe if you ask nicely.
 Aldoggen: I'm trolling btw
 Crosility: Have you read the post mortem links?
 Aldoggen: ore there post mortems for those too?
 Aldoggen: are*
 Crosility: 3 of them, full blog write-ups, to help people design good code for mad pod racing.
 Aldoggen: wow
 Aldoggen: I'll have to take a look at that when I want to rank up my bot again lol
 Crosility: I think that + some runs in IDE should be sufficient. Instead of trying to recreate the environment outside of CodinGame.
 Nikanameu: so i need to make my own ok
 Aldoggen: maybe someone in chat is willing to give you his, but currently there aren't many people online
 Crosility: Completed my puzzle for the day.
 Crosility: Enjoy friends.
 Aldoggen: which one?
 Aldoggen: gratz&#160;:)
 Crosility: Lumen, Easy Category.
 Aldoggen: coll one&#160;:)
 FlyingCow: could people review my clash&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23082426330b08cf05c30641e8564813241a9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/23082426330b08cf05c30641e8564813241a9</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's an easy one, even by clash standards
 wlesavo: make it a valid convex polygon :smiley:
 wlesavo: i think for a polygon the condition is basically the same, but the cheking for it will be a bit more complex
 wlesavo: and you can even make a stress test for n^2 solutions to timeout   :slight_smile:
 Crosility: I tested your clash, don't have anything to comment officially. I gave it an upvote. But, it's on the easy side.
 Crosility: @ FlyingCow

 Razovsky: nah jacek this one is serious 
 Razovsky: helped me a lot
 Razovsky: in real life (simulations) situations
 wlesavo: Westicles i think the statement should be "without his TOTAL odds of catching monkeypox"
 wlesavo: or smth like that
 Razovsky: and btw it seems simple, but i dont get why i don't get it right
 Razovsky: oh
 Razovsky: probabilities
 Razovsky: ayaa
 Westicles: total as opposed to what?
 wlesavo: Westicles opposed to just kiss the girls with the possibility of catching pos less than 40%
 Westicles: but that would just be all of them
 Razovsky: hey dude
 Razovsky: how do u calculate ur proba to get monkeypox&#160;?
 Razovsky: p(girl 1) + p(girl 2)&#160;?
 Westicles: no
 Razovsky: p(girl 1) * p(girl 2)&#160;?
 wlesavo: i know, but thats how ive read the statement, and i think i wont be alone in this
 Razovsky: or*
 wlesavo: well may be im wrong and that should be obvious, idk
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/472DDX5.png">https://i.imgur.com/472DDX5.png</a>does google want to catch santa now?

 Razovsky: huh
 Razovsky: i dont get it
 Razovsky: what is the trick Westicles huh&#160;?
 BugKiller_328: I tried connect 4 bot with minimax
 BugKiller_328: I can't even do depth with 5. 
 BugKiller_328: I'm getting timeout.
 BugKiller_328: I can only do depth with 4
 Westicles: Razovsky, do you know basketball?  think of the odds of a 70% shooter missing both shots
 eulerscheZahl: did you try alpha-beta pruning BugKiller_328?
 BugKiller_328: yes. I did pruning
 BugKiller_328: maybe my code is bad? 
 eulerscheZahl: how do you check for the winner?
 BugKiller_328: for loop, ArrayList etc.
 BugKiller_328: I'm checking winner with 4 for loop
 eulerscheZahl: all possible rows on the whole board? or just at the newly places position?
 Razovsky: oh
 BugKiller_328: all possible rows&#160;:(
 Razovsky: thx Westicle
 Razovsky: thx Westicles
 Razovsky: i forgot the (1-not catched) parte
 struct: BugKiller_328 bitboards?
 Razovsky: okay&#160;! thx Westicles, im just stupid, maths are too far 
 struct: also how many states do you reach in total with depth 5?
 BugKiller_328: no, just tried with 2 dimension array
 Westicles: Razovsky, no problem, when I had it as a clash everyone said I needed to explain how that works
 jacek: BugKiller_328 c++?
 BugKiller_328: Java
 jacek: iterative deepening?
 BugKiller_328: no
 jacek: there you go
 eulerscheZahl: duplicate state detection?
 BugKiller_328: just minimax with alpha-beta pruning
 BugKiller_328: I don't know about iterative deepening yet.
 eulerscheZahl: you search to depth X. then if you still have time you start over again to depth X+1
 jacek: are you creating new objects over and over again?
 BugKiller_328: YES&#160;:(
 jacek: :scream:
 BugKiller_328: :joy:
 BugKiller_328: to keep the board state
 BugKiller_328: in recursive for minimax,
 BugKiller_328: you change board for test, but move it back after that?
 jacek: yes. you copy it everytime?
 BugKiller_328: yes copy 2 dimension array to make new array
 BugKiller_328: every recursive call 
 jacek: well with bitboards this may be not much difference between copying and changing
 BugKiller_328: :nerd:
 struct: you should undo move
 struct: on connect it should be simple
 jacek: so makeMove and undoMove on the same board
 struct: also check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/AdamStelmaszczyk/gtsa">https://github.com/AdamStelmaszczyk/gtsa</a>
 struct: if you know c++
 struct: It has TT, and iterative deepening
 BugKiller_328: yeah, I know c++
 jacek: hmm isola, looks a little bit like amazons?
 struct: a bit different but  I think the goal is similar
 BugKiller_328: even I have many for loop to check winner

 struct: of undoMove
 struct: it should help, but I don't know java at all
 jacek: you can try visualvm to see what functions take most time
 struct: To start with bitboards I would probably recommend another game
 Westicles: I can never tell if nicola is just messing with me or not

 Westicles: Every puzzle he picks some simple thing and writes in the forum he doesn't understand, then 1 stars me

 jacek: n-player q-learning, that would be interesting
 Mr_FaZ3a: hey guys plz what's this error? EOFError: EOF when reading a line
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like you want to read from stdin but there's nothing left to read
 Mr_FaZ3a: while not b:
 Mr_FaZ3a: this is the error block
 Wishbone: Which language is that?
 Mr_FaZ3a: python
 eulerscheZahl: undoubtedly C#, regardless of what you want to do with it
 xGuGu: C# :heart_eyes:
 BrunoFelthes: this optimization event give points to the contests ranking?
 waterproofsodium: hi eulerscheZahl did you get foobar?
 eulerscheZahl: what?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea bruno
 waterproofsodium: there's that google foobar challgenge that pops up when you rely too much on google search for good coding&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i've heard about that
 waterproofsodium: I got past the first 2 levels :D
 eulerscheZahl: do i need to login to get it? i always use google without signing in
 eulerscheZahl: except if i really need it, like for codejam
 waterproofsodium: I think not. I was not logged in, but I was logged in prevoiusly
 waterproofsodium: if you get it you can log in on that site
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like i'm coding the wrong things to get foobar
 waterproofsodium: I will try to solve it
 waterproofsodium: haha it's weird yeah. I usually don't code python but I think I triggered it due to a python search
 eulerscheZahl: good luck with it. i'm really curious how the questions look like (but keep it to yourself, don't spoil it)
 waterproofsodium: thank you
 waterproofsodium: if you ever want to see one let me know
 eulerscheZahl: will do
 eulerscheZahl: i think you also get an invite code to share with someone else when you pass
 waterproofsodium: what I heard I get an invite code once past a certain level
 waterproofsodium: do you want an invite?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no, already too busy as it is
 waterproofsodium: haha cheers
 waterproofsodium: I'm still waiting for that person here that completed it and got a job offer
 eulerscheZahl: do you do it for the job or just for fun?
 waterproofsodium: it would not be justified just for fun for me either
 waterproofsodium: sure if I manage to crack it I'll be happy about it even if no job
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is there a UTF-8 for a half space character?

 eulerscheZahl: word1 word2 (normal space)word1âword2 (short space)
 eulerscheZahl: i recommend it for unitslike "I'm 184âcm tall"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, i found FF00 for half space in UTF16, but wasn't sure about UTF8
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, 0xE2 0x80 0x89 ... ok, sry for opening can of worms
 Wishbone: If a character exists in Unicode, it has a representation in UTF-8.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: was thinking it would be easier to output a hexmap with half space offsets
 Wishbone: If you ever need to generate data that has to be read by other systems outside your control, PLEASE avoid those kinds of non-standard characters.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm looks like CG converts to full space ... "\xe2\x80\x89" same as " "
 Wishbone: Otherwise you risk making someone very angry downstream from you.
 jacek: oh my
 Wishbone: Source: I'm an integration specialist&#160;;-)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "\xff\x00" =&gt; "ï¿½"

 Westicles: heh heh, 2 1-stars
 jacek: chromium
 eulerscheZahl: i have chromium too
 Wishbone: Hey, it stopped.
 eulerscheZahl: for your girl kissing Westicles?
 Westicles: yes, they debated its finer qualities on #fr
 eulerscheZahl: i'd really like to see who voted how
 eulerscheZahl: but all i could find is who upvoted the contribution
 Wishbone: Westicles, I did that one just now. FYI, I gave it 4 stars.
 Westicles: thanks Wishbone
 j4at: Automaton2000 how can i solve the event puzzle&#160;?
 Automaton2000: when i tried to make it
 j4at: makes sense thank you
 Wishbone: Westicles, It wasn't to be nice, I thought the problem was interesting. Even if the way it was framed was somewhat questionable&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: 1 star is harsh. but you know they are biased when it comes to you
 Wishbone: I have no clue who he is, so no bias here&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. i was wondering if it's 0 or 1 indexed. and then BAAM, i actually found it in the input description. a rare event
 Wishbone: ...who would choose to make it 1-indexed? That would have provoked a 1-star rating from me&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: and my math failed me, wrong answer
 Wishbone: My math was correct, I just forgot to... Ah, sorry, that might be a spoiler.
 eulerscheZahl: integer division, all probabilities are 0. facepalm
 eulerscheZahl: solved
 Wishbone: Ah, that's an easy mistake to make. And easy to fix as well.
 Westicles: :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: took me less than 5min =&gt; it's a clash
 jacek: so 1-star?
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely vote at al
 eulerscheZahl: l
 Westicles: it was a clash at first, but everybody said the math was too hard
 eulerscheZahl: double prob = 1;foreach (double k in kisses) {
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sorting is too hard for clash
 Westicles: oh, and that clams guy went off about SJW stuff
 Wishbone: The math is pretty easy, I think. It may depend on what sort of education one has had though.
 eulerscheZahl: true. i graduated school. clear advantage
 Wishbone: Hehe, not all schools in every part of the world are the same&#160;;-)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my old ass signed up for a data mining class ... prof. gonna hate me
 eulerscheZahl: not even in the same school
 eulerscheZahl: at my place we have to choose 2 subjects, that are taught in more depth
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they all insist on using MS access, i hate them
 eulerscheZahl: you can pick pretty much anything, even art or sports
 eulerscheZahl: mine were math and latin
 eulerscheZahl: access? are you out of your mind?
 Wishbone: MS Access? Does that still exist?
 Astrobytes: DAta mining or data theft? :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: A master in business I-tech apparently requires that you use stuff that you never use in RL
 jacek: reinforcement learning?
 Wishbone: PatrickMcGinnisII: Ah, that is unfortunately a widespread phenomenon.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: didn't have data mining back in the day, we barely used COBOL
 Wishbone: I'm grateful that I never had to deal with COBOL. The horror stories I've heard...
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII is too old for himself</b></p><p><img src="/a/75707267075165" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: A bank I had dealings with, updated their system w/ an Amiga dialup to FIDOnet ... because apparently they couldn't do the math w/o a VAX... omg I will shutup
 Wishbone: Ahhh, FIDOnet. Those were the days...
 drawde: Is anyone familiar with training up a bot using 'Alphazero' like approach? I'm interested in what strategies people employ for choosing moves during evaluation while learning. I'm trying to strike a balance between strong play and exploring distinct gamestates, but having some trouble coming up with an effective strategy.
 Wishbone: I went to a LAN party once for the points of the node on the BBS I used for it. That was my first real "meeting people IRL that you met online" experience.
 jacek: drawde have you seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 drawde: yea
 jacek: personally i choose final moves with softmax with small temp so best moves are not always chosen
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at FSU there was a pascal program named CONFER on the mainframe, we would get together often and drink 'til we were ill.  BBS dialups were long distance phone calls for me prior to that, muchless anything else.
 jacek: also i have some randomization during UCB selection where i multiply eval part by random [0.9; 1.1]. (i train only value network, not policy network)
 drawde: do you use a cutoff where you always choose the 'best' or always choose from a distribution?
 drawde: like xth move of the game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm guessing the error_logs are capable of pushing UTF codes wihthin the json, but not pulling them
 jacek: always from distribution
 drawde: ok thanks
 Westicles: long distance?  didn't you have your Cap'n Crunch whistle?
 demon123d: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't get Unicode to do what I want in php, i keep trying tho

 j4at: so takes 4 inputs merge them together
 j4at: and get the next input
 j4at: using the same layers for all of them
 jacek: mhm
 j4at: It works with whatever number of dimensions which is pretty good
 j4at: and good at generalizing
 j4at: I actually used for my search race
 j4at: because there is variable number of checkpoints
 jacek: what are your inputs for search race?
 jacek: i always use next1 and next2

 BugKiller_328: hi, for connect-4 I"m using 2 dimension array for board
 BugKiller_328: in this case, what is best way to check for win for my last play
 BugKiller_328: instead of looping all
 BugKiller_328: for check win
 struct: check where the piece landed
 struct: and check adjacent cells
 struct: in 4/8 directions
 BugKiller_328: yes. but for example horizontal check
 BugKiller_328: my last place peice
 BugKiller_328: can be first or second , thrid, or 4th
 BugKiller_328: in the conneced 4
 BugKiller_328: so I don't know how to implement easily
 Aldoggen: loop in both sides and add how far you got
 jacek: easiest would be check from lastX-3 to lastX+3 etc.
 BugKiller_328: any sample code for it?
 jacek: just like you loop all 2d
 BugKiller_328: so that I can try to understand
 Aldoggen: so let's say you put the last piece as the second from right, then you find one to the right and two to the left. add it and you get 3 additional pieces for a total of 4
 jacek: except the begin and end is -3, +3
 Aldoggen: lol my first submission for cyborg uprising destroyed wood 3 and wood 2

 mzbear: that feeling when your 100+ line monstrosity of a function no longer has any TODO comments in it, so it should theoretically work now, but you're too scared to test it
 mzbear: oh, it doesn't even compile, but the editor no longer understand that because the error involves a lambda
 rwilson: that feeling when chat is dead and you could really use some commiseration
 mzbear: that feeling when people use words you've never seen before
 rwilson: what does 'people' mean&#160;?
 mzbear: is this a philosophical question, or are you asking me if i'm referring to you? well, i had to look up "commiseration" from dictionary&#160;:)
 rwilson:&#160;;) existential commentary ..  basically .. 
 rwilson: 'i feel ya bro '
 mzbear: i'm afraid that particular sentence has a risk of being misinterpreted inappropriately due to ambiguity of "feeling" "ya bro"
 rwilson:&#160;;) i feel that too&#160;;) 
 rwilson: ... in the totally not illegal interpretations&#160;;)   if taken literally 
 mzbear: lol
 mzbear: something has gone horribly wrong with my code
 mzbear: oh lol, i removed the code that read board state because i no longer needed it (i generated it from played moves instead) ... but forgot to leave the code that reads the inputs
 rwilson: ... is it wrong that I 'HEARD' the old mortal combat "WHOOPSIE"  when i read that @mzbear&#160;?   ( i know it's 'toasty' but always sounded like whoopsie&#160;;)  i.e.  mistake )
 mzbear: lol
 mzbear: now my bot is somehow playing invalid modes.  great, just great
 rwilson: @mzbear which bot you working on&#160;?
 mzbear: Blocking
 mzbear: i thought my move generation was working fine already .. ugh. what have i changed? oh, right, i rewrote roughly 300 lines without testing, i changed everything
 mzbear: ah, valid move generation works fine, but my bot doesn't know how to play them on the board correctly
 mzbear: yay, now it works!  however, my bot plays incredibly badly, so i clearly have more bugs to fix :D
 mzbear: argh this is performance issue ... monte carlo tree search isn't gonna do any good if i can only simulate 13 moves out of the 200 available.  oh boy, optimization time
 mzbear: maybe i should've gone for best-first minimax instead, to avoid having to do a full random play on every evaluation.  my move generation is just too slow
 YodaMaster123: Arent problems like this too basic?

 MadKnight: naa we already got a x**3-3 one
 YodaMaster123: That`s still not so bad...
 YodaMaster123: print heads/tails is too ridiculous 
 MadKnight: good as a tutorial 
 MadKnight: pretty much the same as the tutorial puzzle
 MadKnight: onboarding
 YodaMaster123: Yeah, but at least the solution is not given in the problem statement.
 MadKnight: suggest them to turn it into CoC
 mzbear: it's for the "fastest" mode only, which basically means "how fast can you read the problem description?"
 MadKnight: oh it is fastest already?
 MadKnight: then good enough
 MadKnight: hey mzbear
 MadKnight: are u playing RAIC&#160;?
 mzbear: i dont know what RAIC is, so... no
 YodaMaster123: Russian AI Cup?
 MadKnight: it's another AI competition
 MadKnight: join it
 YodaMaster123: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>
 mzbear: can't afford distractions now, i wanna get my Blocking bot into wood 1 &gt;_&lt;
 MadKnight: what game
 mzbear: Blocking ... the puzzle of the week
 MadKnight: oh
 mzbear: it has a tad bit annoying move generation problem
 MadKnight: u can join RAIC after u get wood1
 YodaMaster123: Thanks @MadKnight_, I am joining the contest.
 mzbear: i can look up RAIC afterwards, not promising anything
 mzbear: i might find something more pleasant to do after this :D
 MadKnight: nice
 mzbear: compilers are so smart these days.  half of the optimizations i'm trying produce slower code...
 jacek: tryng to outsmart compiler eh
 mzbear: it used to be much easier in the old days.  this code isn't quite suitable for the type of optimizations the compilers today cant handle, either
 Maxim251: Thats true. I watch one week ago cppcon about compilers, and You will be suprised how smart compiler is now.
 Maxim251: If You do optimisation, for compiler will not do nothing, because without optimising code compiler is doing it for You anyway
 mzbear: ffs i've lost 10% performance in recent changes and i cant remember what it was :D
 Maxim251: link to Youtube
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0sz5WbS5AM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0sz5WbS5AM</a>
 Maxim251: This is amasing showing how compiler works.
 Maxim251: in 12:34 he said also about performance
 pascscha: petition to ban reverse mode from CoC
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: petition failed
 pascscha: ok, was worth the try
 jacek: he has no power here
 eulerscheZahl: who?
 jacek: how can you fail the petition? you have no authority here :v
 jacek: tho personally i like reverse mode
 eulerscheZahl: i don't make it fail, I just predict the outcome
 pascscha: Reverse mode is just much more inconsistent, you either see it straight away or you don't. So I don't like it because it messes up  my streaks that I get from fastest and shortest mode, but of course I fully understand that taking away revers is not an option. It just frustrates me immensely from time to time.
 Maxim251: i dint have idea how make this puzzle ANEO Sponsored Puzzle
 jacek: a true reverse mode

 mzbear: argh, after refactoring, my bot is playing illegal move and running into infinite loops, and time is running out on the puzzle of the day...
 YusufEmad04: hello
 twitlydoof: yo
 jacek: puzzle of the week, you mean
 mzbear: indeed, week not day.  i cant even think straight lol, no wonder my code is buggy
 Velcoro: thanks for the link, magurofly
 mzbear: ffs. performance optimizations won't save me it seems, I need to implement RAVE into my MCTS
 mzbear: i'm gonna run out of time&#160;:(
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: i was thinking about removing them, just in case
 Stilgart: but it won't be necessary 
 eulerscheZahl: continuing our #fr discussion here?
 Stilgart: (might be a better place, indeeed)
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, i'd rather write in english than let google butcher my sentence&#160;;)

 tibithegreat: I was reading a bit on a forum thread about UTT and found this 
 tibithegreat: "you randomly get 2.2GHz, 2.4GHz or 3.0GHz CPU"
 tibithegreat: Is this still true?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure about the exact hardware but there are different machines in use
 tibithegreat: that's a bit weird
 tibithegreat: I would have assumed it was always the same hardware
 mzbear: random hardware? oh boy, that would explain why my optimizations seemed erratic.  but it's too late to set up a local development environment for this, i cant be arsed to write a referee in time
 therealbeef: submissions are very erratic. yesterday i resubmitted a UTTT bot that was #5/Gold and it ended up #38. Same code.
 therealbeef: It's quite frustrating to be honest
 tibithegreat: yeah I encountered this as well, but I just assumed it boils down to the randomness in how opponents are chosen
 tibithegreat: since it's not really transitive
 tibithegreat: like A beats B beast C beats A
 tibithegreat: and depending which opponents the system chooses for you, you can get quite different outcomes
 therealbeef: true, but for uttt it plays 220 matches, and after 10% im usually playing the same top 40 as before until the end. rating dropping from 31 to 27, it's too much. i understand that some designs can handle speed drops better. if my bot loses 1 ply, it's quite dramatic, but those mcts things might not care too much
 Westicles: level 55?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that was unnecessary :rolling_eyes:
 Westicles: Hmm, well I think it is important to publish solutions.  So few do it
 mzbear: "those better than boss will be promoted" .... boss score: 30.70 ... the best player score, by author of the puzzle: 26.30
 mzbear: .....
 mzbear: i'm starting to think this game is flawed
 mzbear: ohhhh ... super fun gotcha, the game end condition is not mentioned and i had assumed it wrong!!
 mzbear: the game ends if a player with lower score has to skip turn, but NOT if player with higher score has to skip turn
 mzbear: and of course, the provided "played moves" does not include a mention if some player has to skip their turn
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928">https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928</a>what is CG working on?
 tibithegreat: looks like a pool table?
 tibithegreat: or an arcade in general
 tibithegreat: or airhockey actually
 eulerscheZahl: looks like a more interactive game than what we know now
 tibithegreat: maybe it'a a coop game vs a boss
 tibithegreat: where 2 player's bots have to work together to beat a boss
 tibithegreat: that would sound... fun :D
 tibithegreat: it does seem like he is clicking in the game viewer
 Westicles: probably mobile.  kind of surprising this site isn't more phone friendly
 mzbear: i'm upset that my 0.1ms handwritten heuristic is stronger than my 200ms MCTS
 MuddySneakers: MCTS is difficult w/ the Blocking because the branching factor for the first few turns is humongous. You have to reduce the number of possible moves you consider.
 mzbear: i was initially considering different algorithm, but since those "what you learned" checkboxes suggested MCTS i decided to go for it... grr
 MuddySneakers: So, I'm using MCTS and I beat the boss. It's doable. But you can just use it vanilla out-of-the-box.
 MuddySneakers: Sorry, *cannot*
 mzbear: well, i just finished the third refactoring, now i can finally implement RAVE which should help with the early game
 Maxim251: Yes, I have solution!!
 Maxim251: ANEO Sponsored Puzzle
 Maxim251: Maybe is not my solution, because I couldnt understand it with modulo usage
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e053072-891f-44c8-b5ca-3e38fabc4572">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1e053072-891f-44c8-b5ca-3e38fabc4572</a>
 Maxim251: And if 'if' statment is true, it means speed is to high. And then speed should be lowered, and whole operation begins again, thats why there is -1;
 Maxim251: I have lucky that somebody in ython make simple code, and I could rewrite it to c++.
 mzbear: i really should have set up a local referee as soon as i got movegen working ... argh
 mzbear: trying to develop this in the web editor only is too painful
 struct: tibithegreat there are 5 machines
 struct: two 2.2 Ghz, 1 of them has no lvl 3 cache, 1 2.4 Ghz with no lvl 3, 1 with 3.0Ghz and 1 with 3.1Ghz
 struct: 2.2, 3.0, 3.1 all all have same lvl 3 cache
 struct: The machine that performs the best for me is the 2.4Ghz one
 eulerscheZahl: i attended a lecture called "high performance computing". the prof once told us he got a new PC and compared some program runtimes
 LegendaryStone: reatoretch you mind sharing your code?
 eulerscheZahl: usually it was about 1.2 times faster. except for one program that was more that twice as fast
 eulerscheZahl: he then was wondering why that one is so much faster. studied the CPU manual
 eulerscheZahl: and then he told us "i realized it was because of the LSD" :D
 eulerscheZahl: he meant the loop stream detector
 reatoretch: ok.  I just shared.
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 eulerscheZahl: a great prof btw
 eulerscheZahl: once we had a broken computer and we left a note "don't use, defect"
 eulerscheZahl: student writes below "challenge accepted"
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: prof sees the response, takes his pen "I kill you (Texas chainsaw masarcre)"
 Astrobytes: nutter
 Astrobytes: I had highschool teachers like that, uni lecturers were all somewhat serious
 eulerscheZahl: and he told us whenever we forget to write "return 0" in our main function, a little baby kitten gets run over by a lawn mower
 Astrobytes: Yeah, someone said similar about citing sources
 mzbear: ... submitted my bot to arena, found out it crashes if it isn't player 0 ....
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 mzbear: also found out that my bot crashes if any of its opponents crashes, because it refuses to skip turns if there are valid moves
 jacek: big branching factor in the beginning? consider opening books...
 mzbear: the pieces are chosen at random, too, making opening books a bit less useful
 jacek: :c
 mzbear: ahhh... due to branching, i cant fully simulate all players even for a single round when there's 3-4 of them, which messes up things.
 mzbear: bugs fixed, time to try arena again
 Maxim251: for There is no Spoon - Episode 1 what better container use, vector of struct or 2D array of struct? Like NODE[x][y]?
 struct: do you need to resize on there is no spoon?
 mzbear: it has 30x30 maximum size, doesn't really matter how you do it
 mzbear: there we go ... rank 7 in wood2 league .... so close and yet so far away
 Marcaunon: when does the puzzlew of the week change?
 eulerscheZahl: monday
 Marcaunon: and what league to I need to get to count as "solved" for the home screen achievement?

 mzbear: dead end.  after fourth refactoring, my code ends up crashing somewhere, and i cant find it .. and i dont have local referee to debug this locally
 mzbear: the code is already 900 lines long, too. *sigh*
 mzbear: normally i'd take a break and figure it out later, but .... when's the deadline?!
 struct: game is avaialable after too
 mzbear: but puzzle of the week!
 struct: a tomorrow
 mzbear: i'm investing in the sunk cost fallacy.  i've spent so much time on this already that i dont want to fail narrowly :D
 mzbear: waitamoment ... i'm using 4 bits for values 0-20 ... i'm an idiot
 mzbear: well, would you look at that, it's no longer crashing
 mzbear: still fails to beat boss, and the latest refactoring didn't improve performance either.  fun
 tibithegreat: that moment when you've been chasing a bug for a few hours, and you finally find it, and now you get to delete all the milion cerr's you added to find it
 mzbear: cerr's did nothing to help find this.  for some reason, the code still looked like it worked, most of the time
 tibithegreat: I meant in my case :D
 mzbear: and despite eliminating rand() ... it still went between 66k and 80k rounds in a loop before something went wrong, and i never managed to catch wtf happened
 tibithegreat: I have to delete about 100 lines of debug :D
 mzbear: ah, i see&#160;:)
 mzbear: meanwhile, now i'm fiddlng random parameters around to see if i can make this work better ... except i dont have a testbench to do this, so this is pointless
 mzbear: rank 3 in wood2 ... if i just wait it out, i might get lucky and win against the boss before the day is over.  HMMM?
 struct: boss is quite far away
 struct: near 4.0 points
 twitlydoof: Is codingame lagging?
 mzbear: after some more tweaking, rank 1 in wood2 ... grrrrr
 mzbear: gave up.  went to chill in the livingroom, and the moment i relax i immediately got several new ideas for optimizations...
 mzbear: i suppose i'll implement some of them
 tibithegreat: I usually take my dogs for a walk&#160;:)
 tibithegreat: when I feel blocked
 tibithegreat: it's win-win cause I get to relax and see things from a different perspective, and my dogs get to go for a walk :D
 Skynse: This year was a complete mess
 Skynse: And I have a feeling that a portion of next year is going to be that way too
 mzbear: haha none of my optimizations did any good.  OHWELL
 twitlydoof: every time i do shortmode
 mzbear: that feeling when the optimization is too good to be true, and it is ... *sigh* ... 30% speedup between subsequent runs was due to hardware randomness
 struct: yes its normal
 struct: There are 5 machines
 therealbeef: they only reliable way to optimize is to run your bot on your own computer against previous versions of the bot
 therealbeef: or with profilers
 mzbear: everytime i submit new revision, the boss loses a little bit of its score, even though my bot doesn't seem to be playing any stronger at all
 mzbear: spent some time reading literature about the RAVE algorithm and then tweaked a few constants ... got much faster to high ranks, but still not doing too great against the boss&#160;:(
 mzbear: found an interesting paper, too, an improvement on the RAVE algorithm called GRAVE ... but it involves one more tuning parameter, and i'm tuning these by hand in the web editor :D
 struct: Whats RAVE?
 struct: its for MCTS right?
 mzbear: yeah.  basically, in addition to updating MCTS win stastics, it updates all children along the backpropagation path if that move existed in the playout
 mzbear: it helps deal with the ridiculous branching factor in this game
 mzbear: because i get an additional statistic for many moves i didn't simulate
 mzbear: boss score 29.52 ... me 29.28 ... GRRR
 struct: its getting closer
 mzbear: i'll just push this one constant a bit further and resubmit as-is lol
 Astrobytes: Rapid Action Value Estimation struct. Never used it tbh
 struct: I saw some paper that talked about it
 struct: But I have trouble reading them
 Astrobytes: Yeah, some of them are a bit... well, you know
 Astrobytes: mzbear: do you need more sims?
 Astrobytes: well, rollouts
 mzbear: more sims would definitely help.  but i'm already managing 1900 of them during the first round, so it's not that bad
 mzbear: it gets much harsher for 4-player games, when the entire move tree gets obsolete before it's my turn again and it has to start from scratch
 Astrobytes: I assume you've employed all the CG tricks?
 Astrobytes: preallocating nodes etc
 mzbear: they're preallocated yes
 Astrobytes: cool
 mzbear: the move generator is the bottleneck really
 mzbear: i had to write two versions of it ... one that gives all moves, and one that gives an uniform random move
 Astrobytes: did you profile it?
 mzbear: nope, i'm still developing in the web editor only lol
 Astrobytes: Stop that nonsense :D
 mzbear: 915 lines of code currently ... in a 25x60 character window :D
 Astrobytes: you know about CGLocal and CGSync right
 mzbear: i saw something about them, and then it said about browser extension and i nope'd out for the time being
 Astrobytes: well, fwiw they are useful
 mzbear: i'm sure they are, this is quite painful way to develop really
 Astrobytes: even if you're not running a local simulation just having your editor of choice on hand is a joyous experience
 Astrobytes: Or copy-paste
 mzbear: i'm finding that web editor quite handy, tbh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, well, I find it OK for short things. And it's a heck of a lot better since they switched it to Monaco
 Astrobytes: (ymmv depending on language, there are bugs and awfulness with the auto-suggest for a lot of users currently)
 mzbear: some languages on CG are plain awful.  I tried writing some puzzles in Pascal for some giggles, and for some reason the fpc is configured for 16 bit Integer type by default .. like MS-DOS mode
 mzbear: and of course, no autocompletion or anything useful
 Astrobytes: Glorious :D
 Astrobytes: They're clearly going for the full retro experience.
 mzbear: it's awful. I have a friend who writes fpc/delphi code primarily, and I was showing him codingame site two weeks ago and he asked about the pascal support...
 Astrobytes: lol... well, you can put in a bug report/issue
 Astrobytes: There are a few people who use Pascal on here sometimes iirc, T Bali is one
 Astrobytes: So it's worth mentioning
 mzbear: when does the puzzle of the week change? is it UTC time?
 struct: its not at midnight
 Astrobytes: I cannot remember if I'm honest, I rarely pay attention to it
 struct: its at 13:00 CET I Think
 struct: I could check email to be sure
 mzbear: that's a lot of more time than i thought :O 
 ToshiTuringMachine: last 2 puzzles of the week were so good that you can play with them for years
 ToshiTuringMachine: why rush next
 mzbear: i want to reach wood1 while it's still the puzzle of the week :D
 mzbear: no way i'd be putting this much effort into this otherwise
 Astrobytes: ah, you should continue with more of the community-made games
 struct: Just 3 games that are not worth playing
 ToshiTuringMachine: there are also 96 pending contributions
 Astrobytes: meh
 Astrobytes: oh hey Toshi, how's it going
 struct: Yavalath, Yinsh and Othello
 Counterbalance: mzbear if you add {$mode objfpc} to the source it should alias integer to longint
 mzbear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/515807626">https://www.codingame.com/replay/515807626</a> ... omfg my bot is pathetic
 ToshiTuringMachine: good Astrobytes and you?
 Astrobytes: Cool. Yeah, all good here
 ToshiTuringMachine: wow Counterbalance that's really a magic shot
 ToshiTuringMachine: i was trying pascal too but stopped for a few reasons
 Counterbalance: yeah it's like C++ #pragma&#160;;)
 ToshiTuringMachine: like... why de fak should one pick delphi/pascal in 2020
 Counterbalance: you can probably enable delphi mode that way too
 Counterbalance: ahyeah idk.. i stopped coding in pascal/delphi around 25 years ago
 Counterbalance: it was my 2nd programming language so I do  have fond memories 
 Astrobytes: wow, well I did not know that one tbh
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah me similar, they pushed it into high school as something better than basic
 Counterbalance: basic being the first, indeed&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: that was the standard progression back then&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: you could do inline asm in pascal which was neat
 ToshiTuringMachine: the very bad thing is that the compiler is not free
 ToshiTuringMachine: commercial license
 ToshiTuringMachine: when react flutter and all other are free... are they still living in year 2000?
 Counterbalance: i had TP7, warez were all the rage since there were no internet laws to speak of as it was considered completely unreal and imaginary
 Astrobytes: "warez" haha, I haven't heard that in a loooong time
 Astrobytes: Toshi: capitalising on legacy codebase maintainers I guess
 Counterbalance: yeah bbs time, pre internet&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I remember the BBSs, a friend of mine ran up the most incredible phone bill I have ever come across. His poor parents.
 ToshiTuringMachine: how much?
 Astrobytes: Off the top of my head I do not remember, it was in the thousands
 Astrobytes: and they were very far from rich
 Astrobytes: Also knew someone who did the same thing with 'adult' phone chatlines, but that was in the hundreds
 Astrobytes: £ sterling btw
 Zenoscave: did they change something with jabber rooms?
 jacek: hm?
 Astrobytes: rooms with jabbers in them 
 Zenoscave: I was added to a new room in the chat
 Astrobytes: not sure tbh
 Counterbalance: a bunch of numbered rooms?
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, I forgot that's still happening 
 Counterbalance: I think they might be clash rooms from clash invites or something
 Astrobytes: sometimes it's privatge message echoes
 Astrobytes: *private
 Astrobytes: Don't think they've quite figured it out yet. Possibly related to external clients iirc
 Zenoscave: This one was named after my univserity
 Astrobytes: Had you recently used it?
 Zenoscave: never
 Astrobytes: Or had anyone messaged you from it?
 Zenoscave: nope
 Zenoscave: it was empty
 Astrobytes: There's been random numbered ones, duplicates of existing channels (just in web chat, not even counting jabber)
 Zenoscave: weird
 Zenoscave: Someone's doing funky things it seems
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It's a 'known issue'
 Zenoscave: but not funkadelic things it also seems
 Astrobytes: There were some theories about that.
 Astrobytes: hahah
 Astrobytes: Ain't no P-Funk here
 Zenoscave: nope
 LastRick: Instead of asking "how long have you guys been coding?" just asked did you ever call a BBS? Talk about dating yourself
 Astrobytes: Hahaha
 mzbear: added small extra heuristic to MCTS to bias the initial move exploration towards larger pieces, so it more likely explores their moves first
 mzbear: let's see if this is enough to push me to wood1....
 mzbear: that seems to have been a good decision
 mzbear: my score 29.28 ... boss 29.18 ... battles in progress 64%
 LastRick: cutting it close&#160;:)
 mzbear: oh no, it flipped back the other way around
 mzbear: well, there's a chance i'll actually score higher than boss this time around
 reCurse: Calling a BBS...
 reCurse: Blast from the past
 LastRick: yeah
 LastRick: I swear, the dumber my algorithm on Mean Max, the better it does
 mzbear: nnnooooo .... boss 29.01 .... me 28.92
 LastRick: arrgggh,that stings a little
 LastRick: what place
 mzbear: i'm going to need an emergency can of pringles
 VizGhar: what puzzle is it now?
 mzbear: Blocking
 mzbear: ... i'll just make that selection bias more aggressive and resubmit, lol
 jacek: oO
 mzbear: eh, looks like trying to force the search algorithm's hand is just making it weaker
 Astrobytes: adjust exploration constant?
 Astrobytes: *did you adjust
 mzbear: i've tried adjusting it quite a bit, and sqrt(2) has worked the best so far ... going even 0.1 to either direction causes the bot to start playing noticeably weaker.  then again, i haven't tried combining exploration tuning with the biased sampling yet...
 jacek: do you use decisive/antidecisive move, mcts solver (though i dont know how that works in n-player games)
 mzbear: i had some such code earlier, but didn't really manage to get it to work for me
 Astrobytes: where's Smits when you need him eh
 mzbear: this code has gone through massive amounts of bugfixing today, though
 mzbear: i've been aiming for the low hanging fruit only because of the puzzle-of-the-week deadline
 Astrobytes: yeah but now you've caught the Community Multiplayer Board Game Virus
 struct: Othello boss is also strong
 struct: Not made by me obviously
 Astrobytes: that was darkhorse right? And he couldn't beat it initially iirc
 DomiKo: is it that hard?
 DomiKo: If I remember, pure MCTS can beat it
 Astrobytes: Othello? Or Blocking?
 DomiKo: Othello
 DomiKo: I haven't done Blocking&#160;:(
 Westicles: Quite the battle on CGfunge prime.  I don't know how even to approach that
 DomiKo: yea&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Hmm, not sure it was beatable with pure MCTS. I had an alphabeta 
 DomiKo: CGFunge isreally different problem
 Astrobytes: still between dbd r and the other one at the top (forgot the name)&#160;?
 Westicles: xevi took back the lead

 DomiKo: I only tried 12H for each testcase
 DomiKo: I guess I have to buy some cloud to do it

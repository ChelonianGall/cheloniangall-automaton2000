 MadKnight: hey Zenoscave
 MadKnight: u ready for the contest&#160;?
 MadKnight: Point[] ps = { new (1, 2), new (5, 2), new (5, -3), new (1, -3) }; 
 MadKnight: oooooh gotta switch to c# 9 
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: imagine knowing more than one language... true pros only know one
 BenjaminUrquhart: how's that working out for you&#160;;)
 Thyl: Hello do you know a web site for the theory game&#160;???
 CodingBroke: Need more practice in data structures. Any suggestions?
 Thyl: hash table&#160;?
 Thyl: CodingBroke
 Uljahn: CodingBroke: start with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/">https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/</a>then learn how to measure performance and finally use the knowledge in practice by solving puzzles or playing bot AI multiplayers. As a bonus you could look at how data structures work under the hood in your PL
 Slendr: Hello, I'm trying to resove Horse-Racing-Duals but I don't have a clue about what to do. Any hint&#160;?
 Uljahn: search for the minimum difference
 Uljahn: there should be the Hints button on the left
 CodingBroke: Uljahn, Thanks for the tip. bigocheatsheet looks great
 Slendr: The Hints button is interesting but I don't understand how it can help.
 struct: If the data you get is like this2 5 8 3 20 and you make it become likes this 2 3 5 8 20 you will only need a for loop to find it after
 Uljahn: and you should find the minimum difference between those numbers
 Uljahn: in this case the answer should be 1
 Slendr: I think I need to review the basis of Java, I feel like I lack necessary skills. Thank you for your help still&#160;!
 struct: Is Msmits still active?
 SeekDog: i don't understand anything.
 SeekDog: Im suck
 struct: about what?
 SeekDog: the problem lmao
 struct: What is the probleM'
 struct: *?
 SeekDog: it make so sense
 SeekDog: no*
 struct: What problem are you trying to solve?
 SeekDog: well Mc sell nuggets of packs6, 9 ,20.
 SeekDog: n is the numbers of nugget
 SeekDog: print if-possible the largest numbers of packs he need to sell to complete the order.
 SeekDog: else print NONE
 SeekDog: I don't understand this problem 
 SeekDog: Can u explain me&#160;:(
 SeekDog: it made no sense to me
 SeekDog: FK life
 struct: So if the order is N nuggets you need to find how many packs you need to sell
 SeekDog: yeah but the test make no sense to me
 struct: so if he orders 35 you would need to sell a pack of 20 a pack of 9 and a pack of 6
 SeekDog: wait
 SeekDog: test3: input 17 expected output: NONE
 struct: what are the packs available in that test?
 SeekDog: 6,9,20
 struct: yeah its not possible because if you sell 3 packs of 6 you get 18
 SeekDog: wait
 struct: which goes above 17
 SeekDog: test 4:input 123 output 20
 SeekDog: what the heck is that
 struct: 6 * 19 + 9
 struct: 19 packs of 6 and 1 pack of 9
 SeekDog: fk
 SeekDog: how I don't understand that
 SeekDog: my brain suck 
 SeekDog: my life
 SeekDog: I'm so fking NOOB
 SeekDog: THANKS U struct
 struct: chill, you can improve
 struct: np
 SeekDog: how long have u been solving the this site?
 struct: My account is 4 years old
 SeekDog: wow
 SeekDog: such a pro right now
 SeekDog: nice to meet u
 struct: nice to meet u2
 RockyMullet: hello&#160;:)
 struct: hi rocky
 struct: What time is it in Quebec?
 struct: isnt it very late?
 RockyMullet: 6 am hehe
 RockyMullet: I'm an early bird
 RockyMullet: trying to get back in the game after a long time without contests :joy:
 struct: I can say the same
 RockyMullet: when was pacman, cant remember
 struct: March/ApriL?
 SeekDog: wow two pros here
 struct: oh it was May 7
 RockyMullet: wow, long time
 struct: March 20 was Ocean of code
 RockyMullet: both were fun imo
 wlesavo: true
 SeekDog: another pro here
 SeekDog: damn
 wlesavo: nice to see so many old faces in chat when the contest is upcoming 
 RockyMullet: the contest zombies :P
 RockyMullet: back from the dead
 RockyMullet: to COMPETE :triumph:
 wlesavo: SeekDog nah, i started programming a year ago 
 struct: Legend or delete
 RockyMullet: SeekDog you'll kick our asses in no time
 SeekDog: bro my acc is few months old
 RockyMullet: well meant it as motivational or something haha
 SeekDog: I just stated solving here about 4days.
 RockyMullet: it's a very fun platform, you should stick around
 SeekDog: I had been playing a bit few months ago but had stopped
 struct: Are you joining the contest?
 RockyMullet: personally I like multiplayer bots / contests the most and since I made a bot for all the past contests I kind of got bored and mostly show up for contests, but there's a lot of stuff on here to have fun with
 SeekDog: now I feel like I want to play it everyday like a game/
 RockyMullet: good&#160;!
 RockyMullet: I don't know if you are new to coding
 RockyMullet: but having the motivation to learn is the best way to actually learn
 SeekDog: I'm at year 2 university now.
 RockyMullet: gamifying learning helps a lot imo
 SeekDog: U know what
 SeekDog: I just study at the class.
 SeekDog: but now covid peroid
 RockyMullet: pratice/apply it in here :sunglasses:
 SeekDog: I can't even study at class.
 RockyMullet: you study computer science or something&#160;?
 SeekDog: So Im trying to use this everyday and try to learn everyday.
 SeekDog: Im studying Software Engineering
 RockyMullet: good
 struct: Do puzzles and multiplayers
 struct: Clash is fine, but you wont learn much from it
 SeekDog: Can u give me some tips for newbie
 RockyMullet: I can't speak for other degrees, but imo programming needs practice or oeverthing else
 RockyMullet: like struct said
 SeekDog: what is best point from puzzles and multiplayers
 RockyMullet: puzzles are good in a way that if will often have a proposed algo / solution, that you can look up and learn about taht algo / technic
 RockyMullet: while multiplayer is mostly AI, so fun if you have are driven by competition
 SeekDog: but I don't know much
 struct: In AI you can also use some concepts you used on puzzles
 struct: Thats why you do puzzles, so you can learn
 Astrobytes: Learn by doing
 SeekDog: I was doing clash all the time.
 Astrobytes: Hiya Rocky, struct o/
 RockyMullet: hey Astrobytes&#160;!
 struct: hi astro
 struct: SeekDog Clash is fine if you have like 5 minutes or something
 struct: Like you are on  a break
 RockyMullet: yeah, like astrobyte said, experience is a great way to learn, mistakes makes you do better
 SeekDog: For me, some problems took over 15mn&#160;:(
 RockyMullet: yeah and thats why I'm not a big fan of clash
 SeekDog: and can't solve it even worse
 Astrobytes: Puzzles don't have a time limit
 SeekDog: wow
 RockyMullet: time pressure is not a good way to learn
 SeekDog: im surprise
 SeekDog: d
 Astrobytes: So probably better to do instead of clash
 SeekDog: thanks I will try it over clash
 Astrobytes: as struct was saying clash is supposed to be a quick bit of fun - it's no fun if you need to practice though!
 RockyMullet: and some have some visuals with it, nicer to see your code do the things you told it to do&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: clash? fun? w00t?
 SeekDog: Can u guys give me some experience about ur learning when ur new like me?
 RockyMullet: I'm old, so that experience wont be relevent much for you haha
 Astrobytes: Be prepared to use your search engine a lot (or books)
 RockyMullet: ^
 RockyMullet: google is your friend
 SeekDog: I google every minute lmao
 Astrobytes: And ask questions, or look for answers to your question
 SeekDog: yeah of course
 Astrobytes: But always try to understand the answers
 RockyMullet: ^^^^
 SeekDog: u know the feeling when u can't solve a problem
 SeekDog: fk
 Astrobytes: Yup. Break it down
 RockyMullet: if you just copy paste some answer on stackoverflow that you don't understand, you fixed you problem, but you didnt learn anything
 Astrobytes: Pen and paper/whiteboard is a good place to start solving a problem
 SeekDog: Do u know many programming languages?
 SeekDog: I tried to do it myself
 RockyMullet: me, not much, like 5 or 6
 jacek: paper eh?
 SeekDog: then I try to find better method than mine
 RockyMullet: but at some point, you know the concept of coding well enough that learning a new language is just about learning the syntax
 Astrobytes: ^
 SeekDog: yeah
 SeekDog: In year 1, I learned many languages
 Astrobytes: Once you understand basic data structures and their associated algorithms you can apply that knowledge to any language
 SeekDog: difficult to remember all of those
 RockyMullet: must have been confusing
 SeekDog: My college have lots of subjects
 SeekDog: python,c,html,css,javascript,java,scala,kotlin,sql
 SeekDog: I think it's so much for year 1.
 struct: all that in 1 year?
 SeekDog: year
 struct: That's way too much
 SeekDog: and other more
 SeekDog: data structure and algorithm
 struct: On my first semester I only had C
 SeekDog: yeah
 SeekDog: that's my problem
 SeekDog: u know atcoder?
 struct: I've heard about it
 Astrobytes: I'm guessing you're not expected to learn all those languages fully in 1 year...
 SeekDog: yeah
 SeekDog: syntax, 
 RockyMullet: that's a bit dumb :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: python &amp; C for data structures and algos I presume
 SeekDog: control statement
 SeekDog: looping
 SeekDog: IO
 Astrobytes: HTML/CSS/Javascript for the web stuff
 Astrobytes: Java, Kotlin and Scala for.... JVM worshipping?
 SeekDog: my data structure class didn't involve any coding
 SeekDog: just the algorithm
 struct: 3 JVM makes no sense
 SeekDog: to understand the time complexcity and space
 struct: or sence
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's standard SeekDog
 Astrobytes: But you should learn to actually write the algos too
 RockyMullet: oh well, we wont be changing your school's program today haha
 RockyMullet: pratice will help you for sure
 Astrobytes: lol
 RockyMullet: and here is a good place to do that
 SeekDog: Can u guys give me some tips to be good at coding like your?
 struct: practice
 RockyMullet: pratice
 Astrobytes: Practice, fail, practice, fail, repeat until competent
 SeekDog: the instructor showed me and explain how it is writen
 RockyMullet: yeah that's why you need pratice, where you are not shown how it's writen
 jacek: good for him
 SeekDog: so puzzle is a better choice right
 jacek: for starters, yes
 RockyMullet: but yeah, don't be a dick and tell that's not how you code something, even if you are right, it doesnt translate well into grades lol
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 RockyMullet: yeah puzzle would be the best place to start
 SeekDog: thanks man
 SeekDog: clash when it ended can't continue lmao
 SeekDog: and my brain want to explode
 jacek: also tomorrow starts contest, why dont you try it
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Just for fun
 RockyMullet: yeah, it's fun and the competition really help for the motivation
 SeekDog: which contest&#160;?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 Astrobytes: damn you were fast struct :P
 SeekDog: i do join atcoder contest
 SeekDog: like every weekend
 SeekDog: for begineer
 SeekDog: japanese site
 jacek: oO
 struct: This one is longer
 Astrobytes: Well this one lasts for 10 (or 11?) days
 Astrobytes: And it's about writing a program to play a game
 SeekDog: how often does this contest hold?
 RockyMullet: 3-4 times a year
 Astrobytes: Usually only twice a year now
 SeekDog: wow
 RockyMullet: yeah they are trying something new
 Astrobytes: For official ones
 SeekDog: Im afraid I can't do even one
 SeekDog: haha
 Astrobytes: But we have unofficial ones too sometimes
 Astrobytes: Of course you can
 struct: you dont need to be here the 11 days
 AndrewAung11: Is Fall Challenge same like other?with many confusing puzzles?
 RockyMullet: you can try and just give up if you don't like it, it's not much commitement
 Astrobytes: Just see how far you can get
 struct: no AndrewAung11
 struct: its a multiplayer
 AntiSquid: SeekDog just get an avatar and you'll be a pro in no time
 RockyMullet: true
 Astrobytes: I was awful in my first one, but you get better after that
 RockyMullet: my mullet is carrying me
 AntiSquid: or end up like a certain level 40+ guy i won't mention, poor guy still has no avatar
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo: i believe atcoder is founded by chokudai
 Astrobytes: Oh really?
 Astrobytes: Nice
 AntiSquid: are you sure?
 wlesavo: i wownder if he will join this one
 AntiSquid: i thought he is just an employee
 wlesavo: oh maybe im wrong
 RockyMullet: who's that chokudai&#160;?
 AndrewAung11: Yeah struct many multiplayer games have many confusing puzzles isn't it?
 AntiSquid: chuck norris of CG, RockyMullet
 struct: no 
 struct: this will be player vs player
 struct: Dont know if its 3 player or 4 or 2 ...
 struct: At least I hope
 struct: I dont think it will be optimization
 SeekDog: what else apart from puzzle and contest, that recommend to try?
 RockyMullet: kind of low profile for a chuck norris if I never heard of him
 wlesavo: AntiSquid he is ceo, dont know if he is actually a founde
 AntiSquid: aha
 AntiSquid: ok my bad then
 SeekDog: My school require me is do the atcoder
 AntiSquid: low profile ninja then RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: ok googled him, so he's doing code contests
 RockyMullet: I'm not much of a fanboy haha
 SeekDog: Is CodinGame the best site ever
 SeekDog:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: this isn't about fanboyism geez . damn it . giving credit where it's due
 RockyMullet: is he on CG&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: well he joined during pacman got legend in 8 hours 
 wlesavo: RockyMullet chokudai is some kind of a meme, euler once said japanese have their own algos, for example chokudai search, and then he joined pacman contest
 RockyMullet: I mean, I don't follow people
 AntiSquid: not sure anymore
 AntiSquid: but very short period of time
 AntiSquid: wasn't that quote after he joined wlesavo&#160;? he also posted the algo on twitter later on
 AntiSquid: actually the algo is mentioned in some other jap blogs
 struct: One of his tweet even mentioned re Curse
 RockyMullet: I like when CG get some hype
 SeekDog: Do u guys active on this site everyday?
 AntiSquid: it was some different guy saying he's looking forward to compete with recurz and then recurz was too busy with other stuff hahaha
 RockyMullet: I used to, but after around 1-2 years I kind of reached the end of mmultiplayer bots, aka what I'm interested in, so lesser and lesser, but therE's enough content to last a long time
 wlesavo: AntiSquid no, for sure not. i believe the discussion was quite before the contest started
 AntiSquid: maybe, then i didn't see the start of it or the first mention
 AntiSquid: but after contest everyone spammed the link to the explained algo
 RockyMullet: when reCurse is not participating, it's my only chance of trying to be #1 in canada haha
 wlesavo: yeah, and his tweeteraccount
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425">https://twitter.com/chokudai/status/713979313377255425</a> RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: what's the search for&#160;?
 RockyMullet: the algo i mean
 struct: I think its similar to beam search
 struct: iirc
 AntiSquid: ya

 AntiSquid: no problem, glad to help Cohmedy
 MadKnight: are u all ready for the contest&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is ready for sure
 Automaton2000: u can get to legend with mm
 Aya_Noaman: can smn tell me abt fall challenge
 RockyMullet: MadKnight I think I am
 MadKnight: how are u ready RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: Aya_Noaman it will be a bot programming challenge, so you code a bot that plays a game against another bot who plays the game, then you get ranked
 MadKnight: can u play against Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i can see any other puzzle's/challenges videos's
 RockyMullet: MadKnight I think I am yeah, 1 or 2 feature I would've like to have done for my offline debugging, but I think it's at least in a usable state
 MadKnight: are u gonna code it in c# RockyMullet&#160;?
 RockyMullet: nope, my offline stuff only supports C++
 MadKnight: how does your offline debugger look like&#160;?
 RockyMullet: like prog art haha
 MadKnight: lemme see
 MadKnight: the code
 RockyMullet: but its a grid with buttons and tooltip with debug infos, with a slider for the timeline
 Aya_Noaman: @RockyMullet ok cool thank you
 RockyMullet: my code's not updaloaded anywhere yet
 RockyMullet: let's hope my computer doesnt blow up in flames
 MadKnight: why would it lol
 jacek: what about xbox?
 RockyMullet: it shouldnt :P

 eulerscheZahl: hey rocky, what's the status of your physics game contribution you were working on?
 RockyMullet: OH SHIT&#160;!
 RockyMullet: that
 jacek: thats CG servers tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: you wanted 3D, right?
 RockyMullet: pretty much dead on the pile of abandonned side projects lol
 RockyMullet: but it was working a bit
 RockyMullet: no, it was 2D
 eulerscheZahl: but you wanted 3D?
 RockyMullet: but with a poor's man physic engine
 RockyMullet: yeah but I'm not render programmer
 eulerscheZahl: but CG supports 3D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/849340c736362b181cdae18a8345462538aa01">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/849340c736362b181cdae18a8345462538aa01</a>
 RockyMullet: not a physic programmer either, but at least I can manage to do something since I'm ok with math
 MadKnight: i can help u with 3d render
 RockyMullet: oh really&#160;? is that new&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: worked since we can upload our own stuff
 eulerscheZahl: just not documented
 jacek: oh aCat is leading leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: oh, 29 players submitted :o
 RockyMullet: I could look it up
 MadKnight: i need to submit 
 RockyMullet: problem with 3D is it takes way longer to make art
 RockyMullet: and a bunch of spheres and boxes is kind of boring haha
 MadKnight: just use free assets
 MadKnight: or MC style
 eulerscheZahl: pay a 3D designer for it
 eulerscheZahl: you have to invest money to create a contest and win a free canvas
 RockyMullet: hu, nice
 MadKnight: use free UE4 assets 500MB each
 eulerscheZahl: upload is limited to 10MB
 struct: Im sure 500 MB will load fast 
 eulerscheZahl: can we use external references?

 MadKnight: here's a good free asset
 RockyMullet: this character is probably animated
 RockyMullet: not sure what the CG 3D runs on

 MadKnight: or better this one
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://craftpix.net/freebies/">https://craftpix.net/freebies/</a>there are some 3D assets
 MadKnight: it's unreal engine, RockyMullet
 eulerscheZahl: like houses and trees
 MadKnight: oh cool, freebies
 RockyMullet: the CG 3D viewer runs on unreal&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: any JS library you want
 MadKnight: oh nope, the 3d models do
 eulerscheZahl: i used threejs for that demo
 eulerscheZahl: the downside: you have to reinvent the wheel. like frame transitions. the SDK does that for you if you stick with pixi
 RockyMullet: hum im curious, the shitty physic engine I made for my 2D game could probably be refactored for 3D
 MadKnight: yea probably
 MadKnight: can u use the same collision detection&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and the 3D rendering even consumes less CPU/GPU than pixi
 RockyMullet: same code, with one extra dimension
 MadKnight: u gonna do collision detection between what things&#160;?
 RockyMullet: yeah, I do believe that lol
 MadKnight: any rotational inertia?
 RockyMullet: hum my 2D games was rectangles and circles
 RockyMullet: nah screw that lol
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC style physics: just make 100 microticks per gametick
 eulerscheZahl: and 60 ticks per second
 MadKnight: and in 3d u gonna also use rect &amp; circles&#160;? or will it be cubes&#160;?
 RockyMullet: yeah cubes and spheres, maybe swept sphere
 MadKnight: cube and sphere is a bit more complicated
 RockyMullet: swept sphere is pretty common for character collisions
 MadKnight: u mean capsule&#160;?
 RockyMullet: yup
 eulerscheZahl: you mean character recognition?
 MadKnight: that's gonna complicate your collision detection
 RockyMullet: yeah usually characters have a big collision shape to bump into environnement
 RockyMullet: then they can have more precise ones for hit detection if it's like a first person shooter
 RockyMullet: checking for head shoots etc
 cydrus: when does the contest start tomorrow?
 eulerscheZahl: 24h 30min
 eulerscheZahl: then it starts
 RockyMullet: hum its 10 am for my time, I think the page check for your timezone
 cydrus: thanks :D
 MadKnight: yea just add 30min to current time
 LastRick: Getting kind of excited. First contest on here for me.
 RockyMullet: LastRick it's fun&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: it's like bot programming. just with everyone playing it at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: you go to bed at rank 10 and wake up at 30
 eulerscheZahl: then you fight your way back up just to be discouraged again the next morning
 eulerscheZahl: repeat for 10 days
 struct: I wake up at gold and delete account

 Aya_Noaman: hey guys
 Aya_Noaman: join a short mode clash from #clash
 eulerscheZahl: hi youjoin a long clash from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 TBali: "you go to bed at rank 10 and wake up at 30"That never happened to me&#160;:)More like "you go to bed at rank 500 and wake up at 600".
 LastRick: You make it to 500?
 TBali: And even more like:"Be at 500, improve your code, submit. No you are at 600.
 LastRick: HAH
 blasterpoard: in my experience, it's more about wondering why the changes you make to your bot have absolutely zero corellation with your rank
 TBali: Yes - resubmitting  any change can result to +-200 places
 TBali: *without
 LastRick: That doesn't give me much confidence for tomorrow
 TBali: take it easy, it is a game
 TBali: and I am amateur
 LastRick: What's below amateur? :P
 struct: My goal is to leave wood
 TBali: Aim high, than miss&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: mine is to annoy some players a bit at least before they manage to beat me
 struct: I saw aCat game
 struct: I must try it
 blasterpoard: I hope I'll get to play and not get immediately discouraged by literally seeing rock-paper-scissors in the statement
 eulerscheZahl: same game
 blasterpoard: then, I don't care about the result
 RockyMullet: annoyance is the best weapon
 struct: What do top people use on SameGame?
 eulerscheZahl: i use beam search
 struct: I never tried it, I need to check it
 eulerscheZahl: oh, also: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/jump-point-search---preprocessing">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/jump-point-search---preprocessing</a>

 struct: wow nice
 eulerscheZahl: you missed a few things. even how you became a mod yourself :D
 struct: now I need to catch up
 eulerscheZahl: and at 2048 you can generate replays that play for several hours and aren't even close to the 1MB limit
 struct: These games are good I dont even need to read statement
 struct: to understand how it works at least
 eulerscheZahl: JBM is working on Freecell right now
 eulerscheZahl: and he started a blog: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.desast.re/pages/2020-10-28-freecell.html">https://cg.desast.re/pages/2020-10-28-freecell.html</a>
 TBali: Beam search: is the beam size static?
 JBM: speaking of which, I don't understand your feedback
 eulerscheZahl: your game just crashes for me. and i don't understand the move list you provide
 eulerscheZahl: C# code:

 JBM: you output move #5 in test "hard" C# and it crashes?
 JBM: ok thx
 eulerscheZahl: outcomment the Console.WriteLine to see the input given by the game
 eulerscheZahl: use the code as i shared it and it crashes
 DomiKo: struct for SameGame NRPA
 struct: ReferenceError: fc_1 is not definedat Answer.js. on line 20
 struct: on javascript
 struct: its fc + 1 on c++ but fc_1 on javascript
 eulerscheZahl: that's another topic. default code crashes
 eulerscheZahl: but that's reported
 struct: What does NRPA stands for?
 JBM: yeah the stub one i'm keeping for later
 JBM: referee crash is more serious
 eulerscheZahl: and the red cards could be a little darker I think
 JBM: even if it's caused by C#
 JBM: darker?
 JBM: i was ready to make them brighter
 struct: darker red
 eulerscheZahl: i think you provide an invalid list of moves. tried to understand the 21 on hard
 eulerscheZahl: had no idea what it should do and tried it. then it crashed
 JBM: yes it looks very weird indeed
 struct: I guess it stands for Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation

 DomiKo: yes
 struct: thanks
 DomiKo: but I don't know what top1 and 2 use
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 struct: Marchete is good at optimizations
 DomiKo: but still gap to top1 is big
 eulerscheZahl: scores per testcase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.js-games.de/eng/highscores/samegame/lx">http://www.js-games.de/eng/highscores/samegame/lx</a>
 eulerscheZahl: for whatever reason aCat decided to have each testcase twice on submit. so you have to double the total score to compare with the CG ranking
 eulerscheZahl: at some point i was first on testcase 1 on that js-games site :D
 eulerscheZahl: btw westicles = sampson on js-games
 DomiKo: some day there will be like 30 new players in that game :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: when it becomes the puzzle of the week
 DomiKo: no
 DomiKo: the puzzle of the lecture
 DomiKo: :wink:
 eulerscheZahl: right
 struct: In 4 months afk and not once puzzle of the week&#160;:'(
 struct: I cry everytime
 eulerscheZahl: you scrolled through old notifications?
 struct: yeah
 struct: I have most of them disabled so I get only the puzzle of the week ones
 eulerscheZahl: you can disable new followers?
 struct: I did not get followers
 struct: Im too low on the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that hurts
 struct: people dont see me
 struct: Hjax followed me 2 months ago
 eulerscheZahl: i'll unfollow and refollow you so you feel more important
 Gabbek: hiya&#160;:)
 struct: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and follow Gabbek while i'm on it
 Gabbek: managed to leave silver on xmas rush - getting my "all gold" stuff sorted; guess one day the goal will be to hit legend&#160;:)
 struct: Was Gabbek active in chat before?
 struct: I dont know if I like this feature of seeing all people that are on chat or not
 Gabbek: I'm a quiet person - so the answer would be no. I was just lurking mostly on forums and doing exercises&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: tab completion is much less convenient as a mod
 struct: ah it only shows for mods?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and you can see kick/ban messages in italic that are invisible to other users
 eulerscheZahl: like: X kicked Y
 eulerscheZahl: and when you kick Automaton, you have a nice day without it until it reconnects
 Gabbek: oh, is it me or is there more people now in Vindinium? Nice - I like it quite a lot.
 struct: When I left it had around 250ish if I remember
 eulerscheZahl: slowly increasing.you can see the history here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/multi/vindinium.tsv">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-leaderboards/blob/master/multi/vindinium.tsv</a>
 RockyMullet: wow still 12th in Vindinium, I would probably drop if I were to resubmit haha
 eulerscheZahl: 27th&#160;:/
 LastRick: Totally late on this but that's a great blogpost from JBM. You can probably guess someones age just from their level of empathy 
 RockyMullet: yeah, seeing you 27th tells me I dont deserve that position haha
 JBM: lol
 Gabbek: interesting link, thanks eulerscheZahl!
 AntoineDominici: can someone explain me, with have only coordinate outpu but we can't choose how to kill a zombie&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it tells me that i don't really tried vindinium myself
 struct: I was around 20 with this code I think
 JBM: my empathy betrays me again
 struct: now 50
 eulerscheZahl: i know i butchered English grammar right now
 RockyMullet: ouch :cry:
 struct: but my code is quite simple
 struct: its just ifs
 LastRick: JBM: Thank you for the Wordstar reference. I can't remember the last time I thought about that software.
 JBM: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: a good read if you know how CG was like in the beginnings <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.desast.re/pages/2020-08-15-html5-player.html">https://cg.desast.re/pages/2020-08-15-html5-player.html</a>
 Gabbek: oh - that's yet another thing I've never tried :p clash of code, heh
 eulerscheZahl: you don't miss much
 Gabbek: how are leagues in contest?
 Gabbek: there's wood and then there's just shared leaderboard, right?
 eulerscheZahl: you start with wood - bronze
 eulerscheZahl: then a new league every 2 days
 Gabbek: oh, I see, interesting
 eulerscheZahl: silver on monday, till legend on friday
 eulerscheZahl: and initially legend will be 10-15 players
 struct: is beam search basicly bfs with pruning?
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is a real player code
 struct: or am I understanding it wrong
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that fits struct
 struct: Thanks, wikipedia explained it well
 struct: all links i was getting was for machine translation beam search
 struct: or whatever its called
 Gabbek: speaking of interesting ideas - I remember finding tower dereference's code to be very useful for implementing tiles scoring - basically a ratio for how many units will be crossing certain tile, super useful for tower placement
 Gabbek: that thing alone handles so much&#160;:)
 Gabbek: maybe the fall challenge will be something with spells creation?
 Gabbek: no idea why but cauldrons make me think that way for some reason :D
 LastRick: Euler/JBM: that second link is hilarious as well. It serves to make me realizes all of my complaints for the past few months are simply repeats of JBM's far far funnier observations
 Gabbek: oh, the article about freeCell is very fun
 Gabbek: JBM guess I'll try to solve yours FreeCell after the contest&#160;:)
 JBM: why wait?
 Gabbek: I doubt I can do it today - need to google how to play FreeCell first :D
 JBM: why google when there's an actual statement
 Gabbek: Oh, it's that detailed
 Gabbek: guess I should check it out first before saying anything
 Gabbek: That'll do for sure, awesome
 Westicles: The rancor is flying on my puzzle contribution!
 JBM: there's a "rules for noobs" section just for you
 JBM: everything needed to solve it is [supposed to be] there
 JBM: and even a tiny bit more for culture
 Gabbek: oh and example game, sweet - very noob friendly!
 Astrobytes: 10/10 for the amusement factor of your puzzle Westicles :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: and the originality
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed
 kovi: less than 1 day
 eulerscheZahl: "Contributions must be original"i can clearly answer that with "yes"
 eulerscheZahl: hype
 eulerscheZahl: soon we have a Kotlin Heores contest again
 eulerscheZahl: heroes*
 kovi: coop potion craft would be interesting
 eulerscheZahl: calm recoded?
 AntiSquid: CG VonRickRoll - can't believe that real ...
 eulerscheZahl: i saw that username in some old forum posts

 DomiKo: purple is good
 Scarfield: oooh the struct has returned&#160;:) :wave:
 Westicles: Those contest witches look suspiciously like the aliens from Mars Attacks
 struct: hi Scarfield
 struct: its twinrova from zelda
 Scarfield: good to see you back, there havent been enough hex games :p
 jacek: penguins are hex
 jacek: speaking of hex <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/08/10/a-near-death-from-voodoo-hexing/">https://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/08/10/a-near-death-from-voodoo-hexing/</a>
 Scarfield: but are penguins enough?
 AntiSquid: best hex game too
 DomiKo: penguins are great
 Scarfield: sure, will have to try it after contest, just wanted to greet the great destructor&#160;:)
 Westicles: So these contests are entirely written by CG?
 Realsakib25: I love algorithm(2)
 ProgrammerDog: lol me too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, we are back to CG contests now
 eulerscheZahl: for a while (2 years) it was done by the community with help from CG staff
 eulerscheZahl: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-contests-whats-next/133924">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-contests-whats-next/133924</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there is still a small hope to get a community contest if you offer a completely finished game. I did that, waiting for a decision from CG
 Westicles: Ah, interesting.  So that achievement is really tough now
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised they didn't remove it
 ProgrammerDog: hi
 struct: hi
 JBM: eZ: your heroku down or just me?
 AntiSquid: ooc was half-community 
 AntiSquid: also CG contests are only twice a year now? oof
 AntiSquid: wonder if it's due to covid
 JBM: it's not
 JBM: (the 2/year part)
 AntiSquid: how do you know?
 struct: How long has it been since it was a physics contest?
 AntiSquid: we never had a physics + fog of war contest
 struct: If we dont count Code royale it was meanmax Nov 2017&#160;:'(
 JBM: CM told us, I suppose
 struct: But i dont count Meanmax so it was FB on Nov 2016
 JBM: I didn't make a mental note much more specific than that
 struct: So we can see that Nov contests are physics
 AntiSquid: how can you not count mean max?
 struct: I wanted to say CG official
 struct: Wasnt meanmax community?
 AntiSquid: ya but .
 JBM: not any less official
 eulerscheZahl: physics might not be considered beginners friendly
 eulerscheZahl: and CG is going more and more in that direction again
 AntiSquid: is XR beginner friendly?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: no physics there :P
 struct: UTG was one of the most beginner friendly imo
 eulerscheZahl: that physics is not noob friendly doesn't mean that non-physics is
 AntiSquid: hated UTG .
 struct: Wondev Woman and Fantastic Bits were my favourite
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic and code of ice and fire for me
 AntiSquid: RAIC 2019
 eulerscheZahl: RAID 2020
 AntiSquid: was joking . god that random aim ...
 Zenoscave: I'm losing track of all the acronyms
 eulerscheZahl: you could reduce random a bit by shaking less
 AntiSquid: "This email is already subscribed"ah they were going to email me regardless (RAIC)
 eulerscheZahl: still not a fan at all
 AntiSquid: what if we had a contest where every participant's name was an acronym Zenoscave&#160;? 
 Zenoscave: oh god
 eulerscheZahl: we should all create an alt account. and after the contest guess who's who
 Zenoscave: that's an idea
 AntiSquid: my output msg would be a dead giveaway
 Zenoscave: muda muda
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: i randomly changed someting in 
 DomiKo: Zombies
 DomiKo: and boom
 DomiKo: +300K score
 DomiKo: i love random games
 eulerscheZahl: that does not sound like penguins
 eulerscheZahl: but LeRenard is pushing you up there
 DomiKo: I know&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: where else could you get #300k?search race?
 DomiKo: wait
 DomiKo: he pushed me to 31.37
 DomiKo: and push you down to 31.51
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: he is going to 32+
 DomiKo: nice
 eulerscheZahl: his own game so it's ok. otherwise we would not tolerate this behaviour, would we?
 DomiKo: We will give him some time here
 eulerscheZahl: contest is near, i won't get my self into that fight now
 DomiKo: true
 DomiKo: I'm trying to get some points in opti
 struct: Domiko whats your score on zombies?
 DomiKo: 650K right now
 DomiKo: but I'm still spamming
 struct: What search?
 DomiKo: MC
 struct: My best before harcoding was 675k I think
 struct: By spamming
 DomiKo: I don't even know in which test I got that much
 struct: Test case 17 464270
 struct: for me
 struct: Test case 18 140760
 struct: I ran test case 17 for plenty of time
 struct: but my mc could not find a better solution
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: test case 17 look like I can reach ~100K
 DomiKo:&#160;:/
 struct: let me get a replay
 struct: and those scores were for validators sorry
 struct: but I can get 450k+ on 17 testcase

 DomiKo: euler thank you :D
 Zenoscave: who are the wolves?
 Zenoscave: I don't get it
 AntiSquid: no correlation, just thought the video is funny, comment is to drag attention to it
 Zenoscave: ...
 Zenoscave: It worked
 struct: I cant generate a 400k+ replay
 struct: But I remember its possible
 AntiSquid: it's more comparable to a CG leaderboad actually, when you are parked at 2nd and people drag you down with submit spam, then someone wrecks everyone with his buffalo-like submit :P
 eulerscheZahl: and then a wild double hulk appears
 Zenoscave: ah BotG best game
 NightScap3: ezt
 cjthegamer14: I did it right
 LastRick: Finally solved A-star by aCat and I feel like I could conquer the world now
 eulerscheZahl: next: space maze
 LastRick: baby steps, euler!
 eulerscheZahl: conquer the world
 struct: Must do it the hard way
 struct: What was the other guy method?
 struct: NN?

 eulerscheZahl: ray casting
 struct: Soon he will finish it
 Astrobytes: NN AND ray casting iirc
 eulerscheZahl: does struct know about GAimax and prune arrays?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: ceg right?
 Astrobytes: yep
 struct: I want to talk to MSmits about hash tables
 struct: What did he implement 
 Astrobytes: what I told him to do, a custom one
 struct: Yeah, but there are multiple ways to make it
 Astrobytes: he was using unordered_map or something previously I think
 struct: I have a faster version that unordered map atm
 struct: but I still want faster
 Zenoscave: prune arrays? I heard about gaimax
 Astrobytes: which multi?
 struct: none
 struct: But can be usefull I guess
 struct: I finally managed to make a working MCTS
 Astrobytes: He ended up using Zobrist, that much I know
 struct: a true mcts not my uttt version
 Astrobytes: Ah cool
 Zenoscave: My uttt mcts sucks.
 Zenoscave: it's a right dogs dinner
 struct: my uttt doesnt have "rollout"
 Zenoscave: rollout?
 struct: "playout"
 struct: random playout
 Zenoscave: I know what you mean, just not how. at all?
 Astrobytes: Oh it just builds an enormous tree
 struct: So it did select expand select expand
 Astrobytes: iirc
 struct: until it reaches the end
 Zenoscave: is that just an iterative bfs
 Astrobytes: (with UCT)
 struct: Maybe ill apply it after contest
 struct: but I must try SameGame first
 Astrobytes: I have a list as long as my arm, I've been very lazy on CG recently
 Gabbek: same issue today, wanted to do FreeCell from JBM and I'm just staring at my PC instead of even starting :D
 Astrobytes: I know that feeling well lol
 eulerscheZahl: i feel with you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vhkomc">https://prnt.sc/vhkomc</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and the fact that i have a bot somewhere doesn't mean that it does anything useful
 Astrobytes: ^ same for the second part
 Gabbek: oh, you haven't coders of the realm 1v1 -- really liked that one&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: on my list for so long
 Gabbek: but then again, there's only one contest I think I've ever disliked
 eulerscheZahl: now you make me curious
 Illedan: Hi
 Gabbek: by contest I mean multi - any guesses?&#160;:)
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Lo
 struct: Yinsh
 eulerscheZahl: psst, don't say BOTG now
 struct: Yavalath
 Illedan: BOTG!
 struct: Othello
 Illedan: Worst game ever
 eulerscheZahl: Best game everwatch the default game, players say it there
 Gabbek: Smash the Code
 struct: Smash the code is top 10
 eulerscheZahl: i liked STC
 Gabbek: guess I'm the only one then :p haven't even left wood 1, haha; didn't feel like the motivation was there
 Gabbek: whereas with every other multi I haven't had this feeling
 eulerscheZahl: surprisingly one of my least favorites: tower dereference
 Gabbek: any reason for that? I'm curious
 Astrobytes: I don't think I've started that yet
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it would be an interesting game idea. but balancing turned into a nightmare
 eulerscheZahl: how strong each tower is
 Astrobytes: Make part 2, call it Tower Deference
 struct: Biggest problem of those games
 eulerscheZahl: was working on it for about a year (with several breaks)
 eulerscheZahl: and you know how quickly I lose interest
 Gabbek: I see - it plays different than most other games, beating waves is very easy and it's mostly about finding the optimal way to save the most amount of gold
 Astrobytes: The original artwork was the best
 eulerscheZahl: not as good as the original bender 4 artwork
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: but i really liked my self-drawn attacker at TD
 Gabbek: they look really nice indeed, congrats!&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: no, started from scratch
 eulerscheZahl: then improved a bit here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/brick/">http://www.hacker.org/brick/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Rat62 played this week
 eulerscheZahl: saw him on CG chat long ago
 eulerscheZahl: a fellow German, and a teacher
 Astrobytes: I like that people are still using that, I just wish they would update the site
 eulerscheZahl: the flash and java applets are totally outdated
 Astrobytes: yep, I can't see them converting any time soon
 eulerscheZahl: new users have no idea what the game is about. i can still improve is i remember the game
 eulerscheZahl: the admin (adum) mostly abandoned it
 Astrobytes: Shame
 eulerscheZahl: there is even a task where you see a video of adum doing som joga-like exercise
 eulerscheZahl: and accidentally hurting himself
 Astrobytes: lol, I didn't know about that one

 Gabbek: about ~10-15 of those puzzles/games are available on pycheckio as well
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, I think most(?) of us know that one
 eulerscheZahl: a yeah, i had that installed before moving my OS to SSD
 eulerscheZahl: mostly playing rect
 Astrobytes: Probably a couple there worth porting to CG
 eulerscheZahl: i'll start with "mines"
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: we also have bridges (there is no spoon) and fifteen in a smaller version
 Astrobytes: true
 eulerscheZahl: and flip
 eulerscheZahl: and guess
 eulerscheZahl: =bulls and cows
 Astrobytes: and samegame
 Gabbek: we have pattern as well
 eulerscheZahl: and solo
 eulerscheZahl: and towers
 Gabbek: unruly... hmm - remember solving it somewhere, not sure if it was on CG
 eulerscheZahl: and undead (haunted manor)
 Gabbek: ohh yeah, so true
 Gabbek: signpost seems familiar
 eulerscheZahl: towers = high-rise buildings
 struct: I enjoyed flood
 Astrobytes: Right, well, better to list the ones we *don't* have perhaps :P
 struct: played it now
 Gabbek: Astrobytes hehe, yep, you're right :D
 struct: Which multi/optim/puzzle is the best to try and apply Beam Search?
 struct: I won't do it today, but must try after the contst
 struct: contest*
 LastRick: *frantically googles "beam search"
 Astrobytes: Hypersonic? 
 eulerscheZahl: 2048same game
 struct: I guess single player should be easier
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic is a single player
 struct: why?
 eulerscheZahl: little interaction except for avoiding traps
 Gabbek: off to slack a bit, have a great one&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: see ya tomorrow Gabbek&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i predict a laggy first 2 hours

 eulerscheZahl: they even sacrificed their trailer video for it
 LastRick: I recall seeing that schedule late last week. I thought, wow, that looks official
 eulerscheZahl: sent by mail. didn't know it's on the contest page too
 struct: I just saw the trailer, it looks nice
 struct: 12687 players registered so far
 struct: Is this the highest?

 Hjax: makes search worse, heuristics better in general 
 Hjax: but you can also make heuristics competitive with search just by having a big search space
 struct: But how is fog "begginer friendly"?
 Astrobytes: "makes search worse" seems to be the idea
 proXDhiya: hello
 proXDhiya: i am new here
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Hi new here&#160;:)
 proXDhiya: hahaha hi
 Zenoscave: Hi new here i'm dad
 proXDhiya: hey dad lol
 Astrobytes: Daddy Pew Pew
 Astrobytes: good alt
 Zenoscave: Are we doing an alt contest?
 Zenoscave: Like eulerscheZahl suggested
 Astrobytes: lol, I don't believe so. Would be funny though
 Zenoscave: I haven't deleted my account recently...
 Astrobytes: :D
 Zenoscave: maybe this *is* my alt
 Astrobytes: Your L Smith one is still active?
 Zenoscave: I can't log in but it can't be deleted.
 Zenoscave: I must've done something funky
 Astrobytes: P-Funk... er, Pew-Funk
 Zenoscave: Rest in P-Funk 
 Zenoscave: because no pulse is no excuse not to dance
 Astrobytes: haha yes :D

 LastRick: what was  the question?

 grateful_tomato: pretty simple undergraduate stuff
 grateful_tomato: puts "#{(m*(n+y)-y)/(m-1)} #{n/(m-1)+y}"
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't speak perl (or ruby?)
 grateful_tomato: "a" is in the first curly braces, "b" in the second
 grateful_tomato: Ruby, you should try it, it is fun as well&#160;:-) 
 struct:  /(m-1) can be shortened
 struct:  /~-m
 struct: til minus m

 Zenoscave: What's the stance on table compression in CG Contests? Not obfuscation but encoding data
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you got her up on the table, compress away
 Zenoscave: Seriously? I don't intend to obfuscate or binary import. just encoding a table in the next contest possibly
 Zenoscave: Good to know
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, sry.  I just try to keep things linear, it's kinda a memcopy versus cloning type thing i guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so many games are x,y
 PatrickMcGinnisII: making it linear makes it faster, there's a couple ways to do this
 Zenoscave: But the game state is usually a tree... That's the thing i'm encoding
 Zenoscave: i.e. an opening book 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahhh, where msmits at?
 Zenoscave: It's the wee hours for him
 Westicles: I would guess anything that looks like gibberish is illegal, but the Euro guys will know for sure
 Zenoscave: It's probably premature optim anyhow
 Zenoscave: iirc you can encode data just no binary packing to transfer libs. Just wanted to make sure stance hasn't changed
 Zenoscave: Like no upx in contests but data tables are fine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The only opening book that was successful at all for me I had referencing issues ...so I had to use a 88 charset to encode the data, cause we get more memory than codesize... as long as you can decode it in under 1s during the first turn, you are good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: other use unicode packing
 Zenoscave: I have my own idea I'll share later if it works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There are different ways to serialize a tree, lib packing...yea - i don't see it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct, edumacate us
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gn g/l

 Zenoscave: 12 hours!
 Felixx: non

 Aryan159: whats the thrust value of BOOST in "Coders Strike Back"
 DaNinja: 650
 Aryan159: just for a single frame?
 DaNinja: yes
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Danii956: anybody else dying out here cause you ant find the bug&#160;:(
 Skynse: Is it possible to make custom clash lobbies?
 DavidDeLord: FailureFound: curriculumEnd of line (\n)Expected: Nothing
 DavidDeLord:&#160;???
 aCat: you shouldn't print newline as your last character of output
 aCat: (probably)
 DavidDeLord: i tried that
 aCat: hmm
 DavidDeLord: it didn't work
 aCat: so no idea&#160;:(
 DavidDeLord: help me the clash ends in 3:41
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, are you going to do planetoids?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm doing atcoder right now
 eulerscheZahl: you have a grid of size 20 x 20 and a list of words (2-12 chars, letters A-H only)
 eulerscheZahl: place as many words as possible on the grid
 dbdr: also optim&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 kovi: oh, that was my first topcoder marathon
 eulerscheZahl: interesting. now it's an atcoder marathon with a duration of 6h
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it was 6 days but apparently i can't read :D
 dbdr: planetoids has no opponent so also optim, if I read (quickly) correctly
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it's an optim
 kovi: it seems
 dbdr: the sim rules are not given precisely, are they?
 eulerscheZahl: with some physics that are nowhere described
 eulerscheZahl: big no-no for me
 dbdr: 16ms turns&#160;:)
 dbdr: (but I guess you can skip them if you want)
 Westicles: I finally figured out the JS 26 char golf thing.  Is ruby 25 or 26?
 dbdr: which golf?
 Westicles: Uh, well I mean the overhead chars for compression
 Westicles: Looks like 25. 
 Skynse: Sucks that clash of code doesn't have custom lobbies
 DaNinja: did you try starting a private clash?
 SuryaTheOP: :grinning:
 Skynse: wtf
 Skynse: there's a private clash???
 Skynse: nice man
 Skynse: How do I make one?
 DaNinja: click Start a Private Clash <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode</a>
 DaNinja: customize it then share the link
 Skynse: Thanks man
 Westicles: but don't share it here
 eulerscheZahl: that would defeat the idea of a private clash if you would just share the link in public
 JohnCM: haha unless you're streaming
 eulerscheZahl: there's no way i'll turn into a CoC streamer
 JohnCM: haha recently i have, it's been fun
 JohnCM: you should try it too
 JohnCM: coc to me is pretty much stress free
 jacek: oO
 Marchete: I'll try it
 Marchete: naaaahh, didn't work out&#160;:)
 DavidDeLord: when designing a problem for clash of code reverse mode, how many test cases show up?
 mhpd: 5 or 6
 DavidDeLord: what decides?
 DavidDeLord: also what are the chances of getting each clash type?
 DanielJB: Is there any way to contact a player? I need to see their answer for Clash of Code...
 DanielJB: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/b2b73c356e61190693cc54ac47cb95a97582734">https://www.codingame.com/profile/b2b73c356e61190693cc54ac47cb95a97582734</a>

 DanielJB: On this clash...
 zsltg: @DanielJB according to the help in the lower right, to start a private conversation, you could: /msg nickname 
 DanielJB: Do I do that on the World chat? It is telling me that the player was not found on the chat. Maybe it only works when both players are on the same chat (for example, the specific Clash of Code chat)...
 aCat: DanielJB if you really need to contact someone you can go to frum, find his nick and start conversation there
 aCat: he should even get mail with notification
 eulerscheZahl: when i clicked the profile, i was hoping for a clash bot. now i'm disappointed
 AlkhilJohnStan: bruh
 jacek: :thinking:
 chofni: hi
 chofni: i m new
 chofni: can any one help me
 ARMAGEDDON007: salom
 joessir: hi
 ARMAGEDDON007: tanishsak bo`ladimi
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl You don't strike me as the streaming type, be it CoC or anything else
 sprkrd: My conjecture is that you prefer to sit quietly and do your stuff rather than broadcast it to the whole world
 ARMAGEDDON007: nega bunday o`ylayapsiz
 DanielJB: @eulerscheZahl I think Clash of Code bots automatically share their code
 DanielJB: But it would have been funny
 jacek: they dont
 geppoz: there is a better way for: (x&amp;mask)==mask&#160;?
 jacek: c4 eh
 geppoz: :D
 ARMAGEDDON007: iltimos kimga gapirayotganingizni yozinglar
 geppoz: not(not(x)&amp;c)
 geppoz: worst :D
 geppoz: x|not(mask)
 jacek: are you looking for faster or more readable
 geppoz: faster
 geppoz: (x&amp;mask)==mask requires 2 operations, &amp; and cmp
 geppoz: it is possible with just one operation and resulting flags?
 jacek: oh boy MSmits resubmitted
 MSmits: :grin:
 jacek: maybe more hardcore bitboarders will know
 geppoz: that's why im 6th now :D
 MSmits: x&amp;mask == mask hmm
 MSmits: you can do if (x &amp; ~mask)
 MSmits: but it's not better i think
 MSmits: (the ~is a not)
 jacek: so it's ~better you think
 MSmits: probably ~
 ARMAGEDDON007: please write down who you are talking to
 struct: ph mp
 struct: oh no*
 struct:&#160;:(
 struct: there goes my 1st
 MSmits: submit not doing that well
 MSmits: I suspect you'll stay 1st
 MSmits: did you change your bot in the last week or so&gt;?
 struct: no
 MSmits: mmh weird, well its hard to say anything from 10 games played
 struct: you can mouse over the points to see the submission date
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: more moves in ob?
 MSmits: not sure, i put the newest book in, but maybe that was already in, i've not been running meta mcts this week
 jacek: oO
 struct: im still surprised my bot got pushed so much
 struct: the win streak was massive
 MSmits: want to finish 36 seed oware book faster, it's working on the last seed book now&#160;:)
 struct: nice
 MSmits: i suspect your current bot has a &gt;50% WR 
 MSmits: vs me
 struct: unlikely
 MSmits: it's very likely, the opening book makes my bot have a deterministic start. Some iterations of the book may cause me to lose vs you all the time
 MSmits: if i submitted an older book i might do better
 MSmits: or a newer book
 struct: wtf i won so many games
 struct: vs you
 MSmits: thats what I mean&#160;:)
 struct: The only bot I lose a lot against is robo
 MSmits: I'll leave it at this for now. I'll turn meta mcts back on at some point, but not for now
 struct: :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/msmits</a>
 MSmits: I'm losing due to book-rps i think
 MSmits: but your bot could also just be very good, who knows
 eulerscheZahl: then just turn off your book&#160;;)
 MSmits: well it is, but i mean better than mine
 MSmits: then i'll rank around darkhorse i think
 struct: The only explanation it is very good
 MSmits: since our bots are almost identical
 struct: Thats the reason I lose vs robo
 MSmits: how so
 struct: Same problem that recurs e had
 MSmits: what do you mean
 struct: his nn did not do so well against weaker bots
 MSmits: wait this is a NN?
 MSmits: your connect 4 bot?
 struct: no
 struct: robo is
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: if I make my bot play worse
 struct: I win against him
 MSmits: it's really hard to say if you're right about this. NN's are just plagued by determinism, especially robo's
 struct: true
 struct: I feel like I always go into same variation against him
 MSmits: he just plays the same line of play vs you every time and your bot doesnt know how to deal with that specific one
 MSmits: and it's probably in my book is why i wi
 MSmits: win
 MSmits: mcts bots seem random but the better they are, the less random they are
 struct: yeah
 struct: Mine doesnt feel random at all
 MSmits: so yours is probably not playing that many different variations either
 struct: I need to increas performance
 MSmits: not sure if thats the way to go 
 MSmits: you'll get marginal gains
 struct: yeah, Im probably done with C4
 struct: for now
 struct: I did learn a bit though
 MSmits: what'd you learn?
 struct: bitboards
 MSmits: oh
 struct: I had no real experience with it
 MSmits: but you did that in uttt?
 struct: I feel like its a bit different
 MSmits: well i guess it is
 MSmits: you could try othello next if you want more like this
 struct: I was gonna try breakthrough
 MSmits: works too
 Kalenn: I feel like length clashes are unfair when you are a C#/Java against Pythons
 MSmits: then use python
 Kalenn: lmao
 MSmits: it is not possible, nor is there any reason to balanace languages in shortest mode
 MSmits: balance
 MSmits: same as languages are not balanced in other games
 MSmits: you pick the tool that works best for you
 Kalenn: yea, its fine, I dont mind that much
 Kalenn: might even pick up Python as well
 MSmits: python works well
 MSmits: ruby works better even
 MSmits: but i feel its better to know python
 MSmits: if you want to learn something useful
 Kalenn: tho I won't have any use of it in what  I am doing, at least now. But in the future perhaps
 geppoz: do you think it is possible that with tree reuse you can perform worst?
 MSmits: not really
 MSmits: you can perform similarly
 MSmits: as in, it doesnt help at all
 MSmits: but i dont see how it would hurt
 geppoz: uh ok, that's my case then
 geppoz: y, I think it can't hurt, but it look same
 geppoz: no noticeable improvement
 MSmits: the thing is, between mcts searches two moves have been played, if a game branches x9, that means 9x9 = 81 different starting points
 MSmits: it's different when a move is obviously much better than the others
 MSmits: because then visits will be focused there
 MSmits: but otherwise you lose most of the work between turns
 geppoz: well you ofc choose the best move
 geppoz: so you keep the greatest branch of your tree
 MSmits: yes but your opponent also gets a turn
 geppoz: right
 MSmits: and he might not pick the move you expected him to. Even if he does, it's another large fraction of visits lost
 struct: I think it can only help
 struct: But there might be cases where it might cause you to lose
 MSmits: yes, sometimes when a bot plays better, it loses
 struct: I would still use it  anyways
 MSmits: especially if you test vs the same opponent most of the time (determinism)
 MSmits: if you want to test a bot properly, add some randomness
 struct: also make sure you dont have bugs
 struct: I had a bug and was top 3 or something
 MSmits: the easiest way to think of it is. Say you search to depth 2 and move A seems best. Then you search to depth 3 and move B seems best. Then you search to depth 4 and A seems best again. In this situation a depth 2 bot plays a better move than a depth 3 bot
 MSmits: (probably)
 MSmits: assuming this is minimax
 MSmits: mcts has this problem too when games get deterministic
 MSmits: I need to grade some stuff. Last tasks of the schoolyear...
 MSmits: also last physics stuff to grade for the foreseeable future
 MSmits: kinda weird. It's like starting a new job
 struct: so its CS full time now?
 InternalErrror: @struct Some days ago I saw some people using Chinese characters with decode an exec in shortest mode to cut their code size. Was that fixed by now?
 struct: im just a chat moderator, I dont think it has been fixed
 MSmits: CS full time yeah, more or less
 InternalErrror: im just a chat [...] -- hm ok, maybe they should also add a report button
 BlaiseEbuth: Report for what?
 BlaiseEbuth: This is not forbidden.
 BlaiseEbuth: There's of course a debate about such technics. But no rules.
 BlaiseEbuth: Concerning shortests, while you don't break the law or the site CGUs it's OK.
 BlaiseEbuth: :shrug:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/minify-is-cheating/191450">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/minify-is-cheating/191450</a>
 struct: :fork_and_knife:
 eulerscheZahl: :spoon:
 InternalErrror: It's just stupid cuz people can't read the code afterwards
 struct: Well they could just not share it
 InternalErrror: and it's not a way that proves any kind of skill
 eulerscheZahl: you can just execute the decode part without the eval to read it
 struct: and you would not know if they are doing it or not
 eulerscheZahl: nothing stops you from doing the same kind of compression
 AllYourTrees: you still have to make the uncompressed code as short as possible right?
 BlaiseEbuth: InternalErrror: That's because you are in a "sharing" logic, but a lot of people are in a "competition and winning" logic, so they absolutely don't care about writing readable code.
 AllYourTrees: struct what does your smart rollout involve for C4? rule based actions? early termination? something else?
 BlaiseEbuth: And there's no "good" utilisation of the site, if you want compete, nobody can force tou to share your code, or to make it readable,...
 InternalErrror: Isn't the motto of clash of code: "[..] at the end of a game to help other players improve their coding skills."
 struct: I think its mostly eraly termination
 MSmits: being encouraged to do something is not the same as being required to
 struct: early*
 struct: but it also has rule based actions
 struct: So I guess its both
 MSmits: I share a lot of what I code or at least the ideas, but I would never blame another person for choosing not to
 AllYourTrees: nice
 struct: Some moves are forced
 struct: if you dont play them you lose
 MSmits: ohh, you have early termination for c4&#160;??
 MSmits: thats new
 struct: maybe its not early termination
 MSmits: early termination is when you stop at some fixed depth and evaluate
 struct: I just return if player won before he actually wons
 struct: ah
 struct: so no ept
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: so you still do the same thing me and darkhorse do except with maybe a performance difference?
 struct: I think so
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: And that my rollout isnt fully smart
 MSmits: whats not fully smart about it?
 struct: I can play a move that creates a win for opponent
 struct: if the winning move is on top of that piece that I just played
 MSmits: oh... I thought that was worse?
 struct: maybe it is
 MSmits: well you're ahead of darkhorse so...
 struct: well I also have more rollouts
 AllYourTrees: is there a bitboard operation to get winning moves?
 MSmits: how many more?
 struct: I think he has 1.8mill on first turn
 struct: I have 3 Mill
 MSmits: not a single operation AllYourTrees, you need to write a function
 MSmits: ah I see, do you rollout from each child struct&#160;?/
 struct: yes
 MSmits: ok so thats the same then
 AllYourTrees: holy crap 3 mill
 AllYourTrees: is it higher for C4? or do ppl get those numbers for other games too?
 struct: c4 is a basic game
 MSmits: uttt is similar
 AllYourTrees: what the heck
 MSmits: this is turn 1 though
 MSmits: when you have 1 second
 struct: yeah
 struct: 3 Mill in 1 sec
 struct: so 300k per 100ms
 AllYourTrees: im getting 300k first turn in uttt lol
 MSmits: also he uses a rollout from each child
 KP56: what is this conversation about?
 MSmits: so 1 expansion = 9 playouts
 KP56: it sounds interesting
 AllYourTrees: oooh
 MSmits: if he did 1 at a time, he would have around 1.4 million I am guessing
 struct: im sure 90% of my code time is spent on rollout function
 AllYourTrees: ya in uttt i expand all children, full random rollouts
 MSmits: I dont expand all children in uttt
 MSmits: just 1 at a time
 struct: expand 1 at a time?
 MSmits: I mean 1 playout
 struct: ah
 MSmits: i expand all ofc
 kovi: struct: i would be surprised. with low number of steps utc can be equal share to rollout
 MSmits: btw, I just tested, I get 2.5 million struct
 AllYourTrees: i just started getting 400k expansions with rollout for all children on breakthrough first turn
 kovi: low number of steps = i mean games with 50 turn length
 MSmits: kovi you're right, selection can be very expensive
 MSmits: especially with cheap playouts
 struct: Maybe you are right
 struct: I didnt really benchmark my code
 struct: I just benchmarked rollout function
 MSmits: the less branching, the worse selection gets
 AllYourTrees: how many expansions are people getting with NNs?
 AllYourTrees: anyone know?
 MSmits: 5k or so
 MSmits: depends a lot on the network
 AllYourTrees: yeah
 MSmits: large networks are slower
 MSmits: the nice thing about using NN is that you can also incorporate a lot of domain knowledge and not affect the speed of your bot
 AllYourTrees: i have a small network and somehow am getting 250k-300k
 MSmits: since the NN is bottlenecking so much on the network
 AllYourTrees: but its not very good lol
 struct: also I tested 3 different ways to update the moves mask, unsetting and setting a bit was slower than the method I currently use
 struct: by 30 nanoseconds
 AllYourTrees: whats the method you currently use? copy?
 struct: no
 struct: its one of the things I dont feel confortable sharing :p
 AllYourTrees: haha completely fair&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol my c4 bot got geppozed again
 AllYourTrees: i ask a lot of questions and am surprised that you guys answer most of them lol
 AllYourTrees: what is gep's strat?
 MSmits: I think we're just compulsive like that AllYourTrees
 MSmits: dont know about gep, but he's been discussing his bot here, so i suspect something similar
 MSmits: i mean asking questions and such
 MSmits: like you do
 struct: he is using mcts
 AllYourTrees: ahhh
 struct: with solver
 geppoz: y, mcts with solver
 AllYourTrees: oh hi geppoz
 MSmits: that's the risk of talking a lot about this stuff on worldchat. People end up with the same bot more or less&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: :shrug:
 MSmits: thats different with contests
 struct: I dont really mind sharing
 geppoz: that is my first, i'm just practicing
 struct: ideas
 MSmits: same
 geppoz: target is to use on "totoro"
 AllYourTrees: is that photosynthesis?
 struct: But sharing implementations or functions is a different story
 geppoz: y
 AllYourTrees: i actually bought the board game, its pretty fun. &gt; 2 players is weird though lol
 AllYourTrees: maybe i'll take my rule based for that one and stick it into a mcts
 MSmits: a lot of things work apparently
 MSmits: if you've read the pm thread
 AllYourTrees: oh ya i read all of it :D
 AllYourTrees: oh man a rust bot is #2 now in that one!
 jacek: :scream:
 kissmysushol69420: 5
 geppoz: lol I had a but in my C++ version, I was playing without solver at all means, since my "infinity" was casted from double to int, so it never was "infinity"
 geppoz: *bug
 Boom26: สวัสดีครับ
 geppoz: but only small improvement&#160;:(
 geppoz: I wonder if it can help to improve the rollout strategy
 geppoz: at the moment it is just "smart" as doing the winning move if he can
 geppoz: lets try more slow but smarter rollout
 struct: still its improvement
 struct: How many rollouts are you getting geppoz?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/566318341">https://www.codingame.com/replay/566318341</a>
 geppoz: 13000 at first turns
 struct: With smarter rollouts I doubt you will lose games like this
 struct: you lost the game after move 12 I think
 geppoz: 13000 nodes i mean, i do 1 rollout per espansion
 struct: wow
 struct: But i guess it makes sense
 struct: I was around same rank when I submited my bot with less rollouts
 geppoz: ops
 geppoz: i think i found another bug :rage:
 geppoz: and will do smarter rollout
 geppoz: well, way down to 4000 nodes in first turns
 geppoz: uhm i suppose with smarter rollouts it is needed to increase the ucb param? since the first terms is more accurate?
 jacek: increase the exploration?
 geppoz: can be?
 geppoz: since the first term is more accurate?
 ZarthaxX: hey guys
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 geppoz: hi
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 struct: geppoz have you checked the connect 4 link that was posted here before?
 struct: come join us on C4 ZarthaxX
 geppoz: about the bitboards? yes
 struct: yes, that was the link that I was refering to
 ZarthaxX: i will try when i have time
 ZarthaxX: maybe when semester ends
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 jacek: too late. do it now
 struct: I need the points please
 jacek: make new alts and submit bots
 giantfluffypanda: hiii!!
 jacek: thats the spirit!
 Wontonimo: There is a value for the ucb parameter, such that a higher value will not result in finding any more "traps" or "surprise moves".  For games like checkers this value is close to 2.  But the lower the constant the deeper MCTS will go, so although you have to find a sweet spot, there is an upper bound beyond which there is no benefit
 geppoz: I am just working on that
 geppoz: I was wrong before it seems
 geppoz: the smarter the expand/simulate, the smaller should be the params
 geppoz: not the viceversa as I said before
 geppoz: do you agree Wontonimo
 geppoz:&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 Wontonimo: if it is truly smart, then no need for MCTS, so MCTS is just trying to find it's cognitive blind spot
 jacek: well if you rollout is more accurate, no need to explore more
 struct: So I should lower my exploration factor if the rollout is smarter?
 struct: o.o
 jacek: thats what my gut is telling
 geppoz: yes struct, that's what my position is telling
 jacek: the smarter it is, it is better to exploit eh
 Wontonimo: it really depends on the size of the cognitive blind spot.  The Constant in ucb is also nicknamed "the regret factor" for good reason.  If there is a chance you'll regret the decision that the smart rollout is doing, then you need a higher C
 jacek: maybe C = 4, you know, for C4 game :v
 struct: if I increase my C to 100 I win vs robo but lose vs the rest
 Wontonimo: for MCTS solver, once it finds a solution the C is meaningless.  So, if your MCTS solver is able to quickly find a solution, don't worry that your C is too low
 geppoz: 100?? Im talking about 2 vs 1
 struct: my C is not 100
 struct: :D
 struct: but with 100 i win vs robo
 struct: because my bot plays worse
 geppoz:&#160;;)
 jacek: and you FPU is inf hm?
 Wontonimo: some people put there C in the sqrt, some people out, so be mindful of the value other people say if they don't specify where they put it
 struct: whats FPU?
 Wontonimo: yeah, what FPU?
 jacek: first play urgency, the value you give for unvisited child. it is inf by default
 struct: oh I dont have unvisited childs
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: you put them all into orphanage
 Wontonimo: if you have a heuristic, one method is to populate the child with the value of the heuristic as a proxy for the first play.  I've read mixed reviews on that and it really depends on the game and the compute trade off
 geppoz: well I always prefer to visit, so inf in my case, but I should try the struct strategy to expand all
 struct: rollout*
 Wontonimo: my UTTT populates the first move to be equal to the grandparent
 jacek: uh
 Wontonimo: which is another option and also has mixed reviews depending on the game
 struct: geppoz if you rollout every child you will have more rollouts but less nodes used
 geppoz: :thinking:
 geppoz: if I rollout why should I not add also the node to the tree?
 Wontonimo: jacek, the grandparent concept goes like this: most likely the nodes win/loss is going to be very nearly the same as the pervious move of this player.  That is the grandparent node, so initialize it with that value
 struct: I add the node to the tree
 struct: then rollout
 geppoz: so you expand also for all childs of the selected, right?
 Wontonimo: the ucb (regret) can be thought of also as a standard deviation around which you are trying to find the real value.  If you init it the win/loss with 0, and the "real" value is supposed to be +0.8 then your STD has to be large enough to lasso it.  If instead you initialized it to the grandparent with was +0.7, then you need a much smaller STD
 geppoz: so one selection, 9 expansion/rollout/backprop?
 geppoz: (9 or reduced as needed)
 struct: one selection one expansion 9 childs created 9 rollouts
 Wontonimo: now, fair warning, struct darkhorse64 and Marchete all beat me hands down at UTTT, so please take what I'm saying with a grain of salt
 struct: Well I think you understand the theory better than m
 struct: me*
 Wontonimo: oh an you too jacek ... beat me is an understatement
 struct: I dont read the papers
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c1301628-4615-4a82-9d65-c7eca26545ed">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c1301628-4615-4a82-9d65-c7eca26545ed</a>
 Wontonimo: oh, paste binned again!  ^^ That was for geppoz
 geppoz: y, I read
 jacek: my case may be different. i dont have 'rollouts' after all
 Wontonimo: i forget what yours is, is it NN?
 jacek: eeyup
 Wontonimo: sweeeet
 jacek: more like mcts-ept or jacekmax. whichever works better for a game
 Wontonimo: is it just a tree search with NN eval instead of rollout?
 Wontonimo: could we call it NNTS for NeuralNetTreeSearch&#160;?
 jacek: sure why not. no rollout, just NN eval
 jacek: but even alphazero is called 'mcts' despite no monte carlo part in it
 Wontonimo: i though alphaGo only did the smart rollout for about 20 moves then just MC for the rest
 Wontonimo: or at least an early version did
 Wontonimo: has anyone here tried using AutoEncoders for your NN to boost training and generalization&#160;?
 jacek: writing random NN words to look smart eh?
 Wontonimo: you know it!  hehe
 Wontonimo: but seriously, an autoencoder can be very useful to turning data into a reusable semantic embedding that is more generalized than the raw data
 Wontonimo: you know, I just need to get off my butt and actually code an NN for one of these games instead of just babbling about theory
 xAmaa: why am i not able to go back to the clash and finish it after the time is up?
 KP56: eh because it's over?
 xAmaa: okay? so why cant i go back and see if my code runs or not
 xAmaa: why cant i finish the problem after the time is up
 KP56: oh
 KP56: i dont know ask the one who coded it
 xAmaa: yeah hope hes reading this
 xAmaa: retard
 struct: chill
 KP56: nah they are right i shouldnt have responded like that
 KP56: im sorry
 xAmaa: oh no i wasnt calling u a retard @kp56, sorry for the miscomuncation&#160;:)
 KP56: hah np
 Wontonimo: hey xAmaa, did you know there is more than just Clash of Code on this platform?  There are bot battles and puzzles also!  The bot battles are where "it's at"
 jacek: really?
 Wontonimo: you didn't get the memo?  yeah, it's in the TPS report.  Check your fax jacek
 Wontonimo: (Office Space reference)
 jacek: uh

 Zenoscave: Someone has a case of the mondays
 zsltg: "I understood that reference"
 jacek: kids these days...

 struct: Dont post clashes links here, use #clash
 Zenoscave: Hey struct
 Vintarel: Question&#160;: when i get "timeout" in the running of a code, is it only a timeout or can it be other type of error&#160;? Like seg. fault&#160;?
 struct: hi zeno
 struct: can be seg fault
 KP56: i believe it can
 Zenoscave: vintarel timeout can be seg fault
 xAmaa: .
 KP56: even compiler errors count as a timeout one
 Vintarel: ohhhhh ok thx&#160;! 
 Zenoscave: how's your bot struct
 struct: which one?
 Zenoscave: your current one
 struct: well my last one was C4
 Zenoscave: Is C4 on here?
 struct: i still have to start my breakthrough bot
 struct: yes
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4/leaderboard</a>
 Zenoscave: bitboards?
 struct: yes
 Zenoscave: I'm thinking of trying to build a RL bot
 Zenoscave: need to get a lot of learning on the subject done first
 KP56: RL?
 Zenoscave: reinforcement learning
 KP56: ah
 struct: Which game Zeno?
 Zenoscave: I'm thinking Othello or breakthrough first
 struct: I think in breakthrough is easier to see whats hapening
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 Zenoscave: How are people reproducing the NN Policies? Obviously exporting to source. but I never could get a framework together to run the weights
 Marchete: copy on a paper, then type them on NN
 Zenoscave: thanks marchete
 jacek: have you seen that article?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 Zenoscave: not yet. Thanks!
 Marchete: this is a working framework, Zenoscave
 Marchete: no theorical BS
 Zenoscave: Sweet!!!!!
 Marchete: like many github python alphazero bots
 jacek: who needs theory :unamused:
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general#experiments">https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general#experiments</a>
 Marchete: 10 iterations to win a random bot
 Marchete: 3 days training
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: at least they should test it against vanilla mcts
 struct: 3 days to win against random?
 Zenoscave: I assume based on mokka?
 Marchete: my code? yes, Mokka
 Marchete: so it's tested to work on a real bot
 Zenoscave: good to know
 Marchete: if you plan to use elsewhere
 jacek: and jolindie actually made it
 struct: ill try NN after I get rank 1
 Marchete: and probably jolindie_n used it on oware
 jacek: get rank 1?
 Marchete: so it wasn't just a lucky weight test on my side
 Marchete: but jacek's bot is much much better, just we don't have his framework&#160;:)
 Marchete: I was trying different things
 Marchete: separate NN for policy and value
 struct: are you still improving it marchete?
 Marchete: smaller networks
 Marchete: 1 smaller and 1 bigger
 Marchete: nothing good
 struct: just like intel next gen cpu
 struct: small and big cpus
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13521.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13521.pdf</a>
 struct: cores*
 KP56: how would you even train networks on this website
 struct: you train offline
 struct: localy
 Marchete: against itself
 jacek: and here i am using only value network
 Marchete: I'm not improving but just testing
 Zenoscave: Marchete why conda?
 Zenoscave: in your environment
 Marchete: why not?
 Zenoscave: over virtualenv or pyenv or other lighter methods
 Zenoscave: does it come with something needed?
 Marchete: no idea :sweat_smile:
 jacek: he probably tried random stuff untile one worked
 Zenoscave: fair enouhg
 Marchete: I mean, take all I say in this tutorial with a pinch of salt
 Zenoscave: Isn't that most software :D
 Marchete: I probably saw it on some tensorflow tutorial
 Marchete: I'm open to suggestions and improvements
 Zenoscave: The big improvement I can think of is distributed and/or asynchronous work
 Zenoscave: It's a heck of a undertaking thoug
 Zenoscave: though*
 jacek: i think he meant the network itself so it can play better
 Zenoscave: I'm no help there :D
 Zenoscave: Convolution layers would be cool but wouldn't that explode the weights?
 jacek: convolutions are pointless in oware no?
 Zenoscave: I meant to add to the framework in general for future games
 Marchete: it's simple to propagate the model to do self play
 Marchete: it takes time to generate games
 Marchete: convolution seems to need less weights but more CPU time
 RoboStac: conv layers are usually less weights (unless you add lots of filters per layer, but it gets slow very quickly)
 jacek: for most of the games im more limited by codesize than cpu
 Marchete: I don't think so
 Marchete: how many NN can you sim per turn?
 Marchete: maybe I'm bugged
 Marchete: I hardly reach 5k
 jacek: at least locally, in bt the bigger NN is significantly better than the one i have
 jacek: oware?
 Marchete: yes
 RoboStac: yeah, but you have a one hot input with no optmisations for it
 jacek: 10k 'playouts' in 2nd turn
 Marchete: that's a lot
 Marchete: maybe I'm bugged, because I use AVX2 and it should be faster
 jacek: but i during expansion i expand all children, i dont measure that. that would be probably around 40k nodes
 Marchete: I know how your jacekmax works&#160;;)
 jacek: my last improvement was something that in theory could gave at most 2x speedup, but gave 3.5x speedup due to cache coherence and whatnot
 RoboStac: I get 15-18k NN evals per turn
 Marchete: then I'm doing something horribly wrong
 jacek: i have 1 layer
 jacek: (hidden)
 Marchete: my weights file is like 97KB floats
 Marchete: 22k parameters
 jacek: one hots?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: 342 or so inputs
 Marchete: some layer, then split to policy and value
 Marchete: so 3 hidden layers
 jacek: btw. i finally managed to do the mirror thing, so i cut my weights by half
 Marchete: I've tried to "join" them
 jacek: so i could use more hidden units
 Marchete: mirror?
 jacek: i have 14*32 inputs, and 128 hidden units
 RoboStac: mines 14x32 -&gt; 128 -&gt; 128 -&gt; 6/1 
 jacek: previously i had 14*64 inputs depending on side to move
 Marchete: 128?
 Marchete: but that's a lot!
 Marchete: and with that you can do 16K sims?
 RoboStac: yes
 Marchete: then my damn code is buggy/slow :S
 RoboStac: my first layer has no multiplications in it
 jacek: mine too
 Marchete:&#160;???
 RoboStac: the inputs are 1/0 , neither needs a multiplication
 jacek: and i cache the pairs, so first layer has 7 * HIDDEN additions
 Marchete: how they don't need mults
 Marchete: I'm lost
 jacek: huh
 RoboStac: normally you add input * weight - if the input is 1 you can just add weight and if its 0 you don't do anything
 Marchete: so you have some custom layer for one hots?
 RoboStac: yeah
 Marchete: very clever
 Marchete: I just go the "proper" way
 Marchete: it seems it's overkill
 Marchete: not overkill
 Marchete: unoptimized
 Marchete: esp. for the first layer
 Marchete: that it's where all the heavyweight is done
 jacek: so you dont have anything special for one hots :scream:
 Marchete: ofc not
 Marchete: I just replicated "real" layers
 jacek: btw. this is also how n-tuples work or how nnue folks do it. most heavy computations occur in first layer
 Marchete: but thanks for the inso
 Marchete: info*
 Marchete: yeah, 20k parameters on first layer
 Marchete: like 3k on next ones
 RoboStac: I get about 6k with a standard layer
 Marchete: relu and other activations invalidates any further propagation of one hot
 Marchete: on lower layers, no?
 jacek:&#160;?
 RoboStac: yeah, after first layer it's just standard matrix multiplication
 Marchete: 6k is still a lot, my NN is much smaller
 KP56: how to train a network offline on a codingame game
 KP56: with tensorflow for example
 Marchete: you need a lot of things before
 Marchete: the game simulation, some inference engine, and a way to pass weights from TF to this code
 jacek: :drooling_face:
 struct: not a good time to learn NNs
 MSmits: oware is pretty easy to mirror
 MSmits: just flip the two sides

 MSmits: mine is more complicated than it should be, because of the 60-64 bit overflow
 jacek: yeah, my first experiments were bugged due to sign and whatnot
 MSmits: it's always the signs that get you
 jacek: thats a bad sign isnt it
 MSmits: significantly bad

 KP56: the latest commit on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a> has been made 3 years ago, is it still a valid platform to use?
 DomiKo: latest commit is from May 25
 KP56: my bad

 struct: I wonder if I should try to improve my c4 bot a bit
 struct: or do bt
 struct: ive been lazy past few days
 sprkrd: is there anyway to close the chat (not just hide it)? it's kind of annoying to see messages popping up when i'm losing my nerves debugging something. When I'm so nervous it's kind of hard to not see them (no offense meant guys &lt;3)
 RoboStac: put ?disableChat on the urk
 RoboStac: *url
 sprkrd: thank you!!
 Marchete: and it can even ping you in red sprkrd
 Marchete: for maximum rage, sprkrd

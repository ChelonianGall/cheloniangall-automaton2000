 jrke: when will spring challenge start any exact time released?
 grrlic: 2 am utc
 orangesnowfox: *pm
 davilla: *2022
 KiwiTae: spiralpinata now you know
 jacek: in codegolf questions it says the codesize in the ide
 Manchi_o6o7: if someone can explain me the mistake here
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92360cd8-4aac-4b3f-aa41-6381f248272d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/92360cd8-4aac-4b3f-aa41-6381f248272d</a>
 KiwiTae: is your compiler screaming?
 Manchi_o6o7: line 12
 davilla: man I've never seen a function signature that whacky
 Manchi_o6o7: why
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 whyyyy?
 davilla: cause I never made it as far in c as you have
 Automaton2000: but no idea how to make custom keybinds for the editor's vim modes. i would like
 Passifi: so I found a pseudo code to the greedy tower problem and just implemented it but it still seems not to work properly would anyone look at my solution and maybe point out the mistake&#160;:) basic test cases work fine but the more involved ones fail
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0bd07c01-4036-4a77-adbd-b2640e470319">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0bd07c01-4036-4a77-adbd-b2640e470319</a>
 pmor: @Passifi If I had to guess, I would say its due to removing of elements in the for loop.
 pmor: erasing messes up the iterator, so you need to do something like it = edges.erase(it); 
 Passifi: oh I struggled with that before but I thought setting the iterator one back should fix it. it keeps it from crashing at the very least ^^
 pmor: yeah...can't do that when you modify the list.  it++ and it-- are invalid
 pmor: the other way to do it is to avoid the for loop entirely and use std::remove_if
 Passifi: hmm i see well maybe I just try doing it without iterators then I tried a number of things but usually that let to segmentation faults
 Passifi: meddling with the iterators just seems to lead to headaches ^^
 MadKnight: what are u guys discussing&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine actually reading old chat messages
 Automaton2000: but i am not a good way to learn programming
 Passifi: My implementation of a piece of pseudo code the paste bin should still be up there. Apparently iterators are my new bane :upside_down:
 pmor: If it was me, I would have used std::remove_if. If you want to use the for loop, you will need to change it as well. You will need to remove the it++ from the loop and put it as the else to your if statement 
 MadKnight: Passifi i feel like c++ is not your thing
 MadKnight: i mean not in the way it sounds
 pmor: He's trying to remove elements from a vector within a loop
 Passifi: I didn't know about remove_if btw so I might give that a try
 Passifi: thanks for the input btw
 MadKnight: i mean.... if u became a fan of iterators then u should certainly try c# which is like c++ but with more cool stuff like iterators
 RoboStac: the return value from erase can also be used (it returns a valid iterator pointing to the next element) but you'd need to change the loop slightly or it'll skip things
 MadKnight: i think u are gonna love c# Passifi
 pmor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba27bfce-7231-4542-8520-c90846343414">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba27bfce-7231-4542-8520-c90846343414</a>
 jacek: c#sb?
 pmor: your forloop should look like that
 MadKnight: ignore those trolls Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or i might have to do with it
 tibithegreat: for the spring challenge, it says it starts may 6 at 5pm. What timezone is that tho?
 GiovanniDe: you're the CSS to my HTML
 MadKnight: it's either Paris or EST which is like +0
 RoboStac: CG times are always french (CEST at the moment)
 tibithegreat: ok, thanks
 Passifi: hmm yeah that actually gives the same results ^^ maybe I am still missing something about that pseudo code I<i> have to dig in a little more this problem just cost me all my youth and energy :upside_down: I thought if I just take some pseudo code from the world of academy it had to work ^^</i>
 MadKnight: Passifi u gotta try C#
 MadKnight: come to the dark side
 Passifi: anyways last question for the native speakers here does "remove every incident on either v or u " mean remove all the incidents on v or u or does it mean choice on of them and remove all those incidents&#160;? I wasn't clear about that
 Passifi: I use c# for unity :P
 MadKnight: it wouldn't be clear in any language
 Passifi: but nothing has the regal aura of c++&#160;;)
 RoboStac: yeah, I think your code before is technically undefined but probably would give the correct results due to how vector iterators are implemented
 MadKnight: well basically it sounds like - remove all from either v or u
 RoboStac: always better to check that it isn't hitting some weird edge case though
 MadKnight: Passifi c# is pretty close to c++
 MadKnight: Passifi also the iterators go against the c++ aura
 jacek: hm?
 MadKnight: wait can u repeat the problem Passifi? 
 MadKnight: i just came and i dunno
 Passifi: the actual problem is this
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/battle-tower">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/battle-tower</a>
 MadKnight: nonono i mean your problem with your code
 Passifi: and i implemented it like that
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f5fced41-9f85-4937-8c31-799ae98a072f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f5fced41-9f85-4937-8c31-799ae98a072f</a>
 MadKnight: and what's the problem&#160;?
 Passifi: the code works ( also fast enough) but the results are of so I was wondering whether I implemented the pseudo code corretly or whether the solution I found just doesn't apply here ^^
 Passifi: with this problem every idea I have breaks some other testcase and I am starting to have vietnam flashbacks :pensive:
 MadKnight: just gimme the full code
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b5a615d-7797-4afc-afd0-e9ab85a0114f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b5a615d-7797-4afc-afd0-e9ab85a0114f</a>
 andrefpoliveira: Teh contest starts at 15pm GMT?
 andrefpoliveira: The*
 andrefpoliveira: 3pm*
 MadKnight: Passifi so at which test case is it not doing well&#160;?
 Passifi: starts to fail at medium 2 test case 6
 tibithegreat: I don't think your greedy works
 tibithegreat: from your comment i also see that it's a APROXMATION-vertex-cover
 tibithegreat: it probably gives a decent result on large graphs on which computing the actual vertex cover is impossible
 tibithegreat: if i remember correctly the vertex cover is a NP problem on general graphs
 tibithegreat: but this is not a general graph&#160;:)
 tibithegreat: 1. All cells are interconnected by corridors.2. There is no loop between the cells and no self-loop in any cell.
 tibithegreat: Hint: those 2 conditions are really important
 Passifi: hmmm okay that makes sense I had a hunch this might be the problem since the bad test cases return smaller number then expected. Well its back to the drawing board then but thanks to everyone for the input&#160;:)
 MadKnight: Passifi i kinda feel like maybe u didn't implement the puzzles rules correctly
 tibithegreat: hmm if your result is smaller than there is probably a bug in your code
 MadKnight: i can send u some code in DM Passifi
 KalamariKing: Send it here
 tibithegreat: it should be higher
 MadKnight: so i DM'ed u Passifi
 KalamariKing: It will turn into a link if its more than 5 lines
 MadKnight: more than 4 *
 MadKnight: ............
 KalamariKing: Yeah that
 tibithegreat: because you're algo seems to find a valid vertex cover
 Passifi: I seem to have problems with wrapping my head around graph problems in general, this does not feel like a medium puzzle to me ^^ 
 tibithegreat: just not the valid one
 tibithegreat: sorry
 tibithegreat: the optimal one
 MadKnight: u just haven't seen the hard ones Passifi
 tibithegreat: i'll give you another hint: those 2 conditions mean the graph is a tree
 tibithegreat: and every tree is a bipartite graph
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine not knowing what's a bipartite graph
 Automaton2000: has been banned by madknight.
 MadKnight: so true....
 Scarfield: xD
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 2017 was soo nice...
 Automaton2000: i dont mind either way
 KalamariKing: gm everyone
 KalamariKing: how's life
 MadKnight: hihi
 MadKnight: u ready for the contest&#160;?
 gigolo: :heart_eyes_cat:
 Cryptonian: f off
 Cryptonian: everyone
 KalamariKing: MadKnight not at all
 KalamariKing: Cryptonian what was that for?
 jacek: oO
 MadKnight: KalamariKing good enough
 KalamariKing: MadKnight I've hardly done any bot programming and even that I sucked at&#160;:/
 gigolo: Automaton2000 Cryptonian  is ur friend&#160;?
 Automaton2000: im trying to get it to work
 KalamariKing: You got this
 MadKnight: don't worry KalamariKing just join and rek everyone
 MadKnight: at least jacek
 KalamariKing: lmao watch me get below a newbie
 KalamariKing: got a lot of reading to do today&#160;:|
 MadKnight: what reading&#160;?
 raiz_rizon: no lets play code
 raiz_rizon: :grimacing:
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 how do u play code
 Automaton2000: i think i'm going to be very good at it
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 pls
 Automaton2000: do you know the name
 gigolo: Automaton2000  i know
 Automaton2000: so i will have to think about it
 KalamariKing: Reading as in just reading up on things like genetic algorithms, bot programming, etc
 KalamariKing: I know nothing of decision trees and more than likely that's going to be a part of it
 MadKnight: KalamariKing just go with if()s
 MadKnight: people are managing to reach top gold with just if()s 
 KalamariKing: Wait really?
 MadKnight: ye just ask uljahn
 MadKnight: hmmm he's not here
 KalamariKing: This'll be my first contest so you might have to explain some things
 MadKnight: just play a few of the older contests
 KalamariKing: All the ones I've checked are closed... the ones that aren't have another name, right?
 KalamariKing: I just forgot that name
 GeorgiD: Does clash of code work for you guys?
 KalamariKing: I think it just went down
 KalamariKing: My solution is stuck on pending
 GeorgiD: Yeah it just counts down and doesn't load
 KalamariKing: Would any of the 13 online mods like to help
 jacek: ahh pre-contest crash eh
 MadKnight: KalamariKing they're all in here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 gigolo: what about a weekly contest with 5 or 4 problems from clash of code :p
 raiz_rizon: yes
 KalamariKing: Oh that's them?
 MadKnight: yep
 KalamariKing: Oh thanks
 KalamariKing: Which would you suggest, if any
 MadKnight: the cooking one maybe?
 raiz_rizon: no im ineed Work
 MadKnight: if u want some ifs
 raiz_rizon: wait
 KalamariKing: Wait what
 MadKnight: code a la mode
 KalamariKing: epic
 MadKnight: did u find it&#160;?
 raiz_rizon: STOPPP&#160;!:rage:
 Philbot: what's going on
 jacek:&#160;?
 MadKnight: guys don't spam
 KalamariKing: Stop what raiz_rizon
 Philbot: why is raiz angry
 KalamariKing: idk
 Sirlamb: has clash stopped working
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 Sirlamb:&#160;:(

 KalamariKing: CoC might be back, or at least something happened
 KalamariKing: 3 past clashes just ended at the same time
 gigolo: :nerd:
 _CtrlAltDel_: working
 raiz_rizon: working for game :joy:
 KalamariKing: raiz_rizon you good?
 raiz_rizon: yes im good
 KalamariKing: epic
 MadKnight: raiz_rizon well and how old are u&#160;?
 lastshamp: :poop:
 raiz_rizon: im raiz my brother rizon
 MadKnight: oh no Automaton2000
 KalamariKing: There seems to be an influx of young programmers now that the contest is tomorrow
 Automaton2000: do you take into account the fact that i can use my csb starter
 raiz_rizon:  waittttttttttttttttt
 raiz_rizon: not tumormor
 KalamariKing: what are you saying raiz_rizon
 raiz_rizon: im kiding
 MadKnight: raiz_rizon u can get banned if u keep going like that
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is ruthless
 raiz_rizon: ok 
 Automaton2000: it's a game of checkers, on a 8x8 board
 KalamariKing: The contest? Or smth else?
 raiz_rizon: 8x8 ok
 raiz_rizon: yes
 MadKnight: KalamariKing he wasn't making a point
 KalamariKing: Oh
 KalamariKing: Then what is the 8x8 about
 MadKnight: dude that's a bot, he generates random messages
 raiz_rizon: yes and making game
 KalamariKing: I thought so but how
 MadKnight: raiz_rizon pls
 MadKnight: stop not making sense
 KalamariKing: lmao
 raiz_rizon: sorry
 KalamariKing: raiz_rizon is your mother tongue not English?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's start banning people for not making sense for too long
 Automaton2000: but it's not like i have the same distance to the center of the map
 MadKnight: KalamariKing i'd say he's just young
 MadKnight: very
 KalamariKing: That was my next question
 raiz_rizon: no im Englis 
 KalamariKing: Bc a translator would spell correctly
 raiz_rizon: no
 raiz_rizon: im in indo
 raiz_rizon: sorry
 KalamariKing: bruv
 MadKnight: KalamariKing let's just discuss some bots
 KalamariKing: sounds better than raiz
 KalamariKing: What exactly IS Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but my bot isn't good enough to do that xd
 raiz_rizon: my dad is Englis
 MadKnight: there's a puzzle on how to create your own Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: well i mean the one in the middle of nowhere
 KalamariKing: Oh really? I'm checking that out
 raiz_rizon: no 
 MadKnight: noone wanted to know that raiz_rizon
 KalamariKing: Does it use a list of messages or chain words together or smth, or is it generated from a nn or smth?
 MadKnight: more like a chain
 raiz_rizon: im :sweat_smile:
 KalamariKing: Huh
 KalamariKing: Where are the words from?
 raiz_rizon: indo
 MadKnight: from like 5 years of chat history
 raiz_rizon: no im 7 yers
 MadKnight: raiz_rizon cmon, just stop
 KalamariKing: I thought he talked a lot like this chat
 MadKnight: KalamariKing there's also a russian version on #ru
 KalamariKing: raiz_rizon we're no longer discussing your ineptitude
 KalamariKing: You speak russian?
 MadKnight: ye
 MadKnight: ofc i do, i'm from russia
 raiz_rizon: im no join guys
 raiz_rizon: :rage::rage::rage:
 KalamariKing: Oh sick
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's just ban this raiz_rizon guy
 Automaton2000: could the validators in the repo not have been in a convenient format ffs...
 KalamariKing: Wait can Automaton2000 ban people?
 Automaton2000: because you have a job
 MadKnight: would be perfect if he could....
 KalamariKing: Wait you're a mod! I never realised that
 raiz_rizon: lets play code
 raiz_rizon: yes
 MadKnight: KalamariKing this chat is overly filled with raiz_rizon's let's go talk in DM
 KalamariKing: Ye
 MadKnight: can't handle it
 raiz_rizon: STOPPPP IM NO JOIN IM :rage:
 raiz_rizon: my no name 
 raiz_rizon: imin no my name
 Uljahn: u good?
 Penguin12463: yum
 Whatar: :robot:
 JormaWuorio: Can someone help me with coders strike back?
 Whatar: Automaton2000 help Jorma pls
 Automaton2000: oh, that was a bit more
 JormaWuorio: I really dont get how to input further than the first checkpoints co-ordinates
 Philbot: raiz is acting crazy
 Philbot: are there no mods in this chat?
 Whatar: noone other than Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: thats not even me lol
 Whatar: true
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 is a bot, he can't ban
 Automaton2000: if u are doing it for a puzzle
 KalamariKing: Supposedly there are 13 online mods rn
 Whatar: Automaton2000 can't ban today, but what about the future?
 Automaton2000: i wanted to know if my bot would be a nice feature
 KalamariKing: Hopefully, that would be so helpful
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Some of us are - you know - working. 
 KalamariKing: Ok, JormaWuorio what did you need?
 Astrobytes: If there is an issue, ping a mod.
 JormaWuorio: Talking about it with gigolo already thanks!&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: Yeah but we don't wanna disrupt you, because yk, you're working
 Astrobytes: We don't just sit here staring at the chat waiting for things to go wrong.
 KalamariKing: Ok gl
 Astrobytes: Fine. Well, you're getting no further help from me.
 KalamariKing: What oh I was talking to jorma
 KalamariKing: We just wanted this raiz_rizon kid to stop spamming
 Whatar: anyway guys, are you excited for the new contest?
 Astrobytes: You were with Mad Knight...
 KalamariKing: This'll be my first, so yeah
 Whatar: I am excited too, I got bored during the last one and I did stop at bronze, but I want gold with this one
 Whatar: the problem is, every contest the people I know in the real world aren't willing to play with me
 Whatar: rip me I guess
 KalamariKing: Yeah same lol
 Whatar: "escape" is another matter though, I was able to get a couple of friends in a game and we had fun 
 KalamariKing: Oh lucky
 Philbot: what was the last one like that made it boring
 Whatar: well being another time alone in the contest and this time the contest itself was a bit weird
 Philbot: and why was it weird
 Whatar: mmh, it's hard for me to express what I didn't like, en is not my primary language, let's say that I prefer the ai that can move and interact with the environment and eachother
 Mo0nke: I have never coded before, I don't even know what my objective is. I'm so confused. I don't even know what half the words mean.
 Whatar: just start with the simpler puzzles
 Philbot: the optimal solution wasn't obvious?
 Whatar: what do you mean?
 KalamariKing: Mo0nke You could (a) find a tutorial online or (b) just throw yourself into onboarding or smth and google stuff
 Philbot: i wonder how many felt the same way as you did
 Whatar: AutomatonNN are you here?
 MadKnight: AutomatonNN don't tell him
 KalamariKing: Wait what happened to your--
 KalamariKing: weren't you--
 KalamariKing: weren't you mod
 JormaWuorio: Is it possible to beat the boss without the boost when boost is first accessible?
 JLukeSkywalker: for what puzzle Jorma?
 JLukeSkywalker: CSB yes
 JormaWuorio: Yeah csb
 JormaWuorio: Dont know which one it is but its not far from the beginning
 JLukeSkywalker: i think you can get to gold without boosting
 JormaWuorio: oh wow
 JormaWuorio: Im in the wood league
 JLukeSkywalker: it def helps tho
 JLukeSkywalker: i think i just did an if dist &gt; someVal boost
 JormaWuorio: if next_checkpoint_angle &gt; 90 or next_checkpoint_angle &lt; -90:
 Nezinau: you can only boost once, so make sure you add that
 JormaWuorio: I kinda would like to save that since its only once a day
 JormaWuorio: Gotta go brb
 KalamariKing: I got some questions, if anyone uses nns for the bot battles
 KalamariKing: How exactly do you train it?
 struct: offline
 KalamariKing: And then you give it the trained network, yeah
 KalamariKing: But where does the data come from for training then?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article</a>
 DomiKo: KalamariKing you just create data
 Tiramon: for my oware nn i just let play multiple networks agains each otherand sometimes seed it with some state it doesn't learn itself
 TobiasA: hi
 Omar3433: Hi who work with bash&#160;?
 Omar3433: i need a help 
 Tiramon: why don't you just ask your question? then anybody can decide if it is to complex for him to answer or not ...
 TobiasA: that never gets old:joy:
 B-612: hi 
 Tiramon: 'who works with bash' could mean anything from how does a if work to how do i write a nn with bash ...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>it's (3) again
 Tiramon: uuh i like that link&#160;;)
 TobiasA: i knew you would show up :joy:
 Alshock: hm aint it 2 first?
 eulerscheZahl: and i usually ignore those questions as i don't want to get myself into something without knowing what I agree to
 Alshock: oh it's 1 sory, I mix them up
 Tiramon: it's 1 for sure
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday I had a 4.how does pow work in python?oh it's **
 B-612: is anybody know how can write regex functions&#160;? (handwrite functions for homework) i couldnt found anycode 
 Tiramon: yes i do ... stil this doesn't help you anything&#160;;)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a> is a nice site to test your regex anyway
 B-612: I need regex functions&#160;:'/ how to distruct regex 
 B-612: how its works union functions
 eulerscheZahl: what does "distruct" even mean?
 Tiramon: feels like a 2 ...
 Tiramon: with translation problems ...
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are close to bingo already
 Tiramon: oh ask questions properly bingo ... nice idea&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I must've had a full house so many times I'm too bitter to play anymore
 Philbot: you should play yatzee instead
 Philbot: decide what numbers to keep or reroll
 Astrobytes: Hm. Interesting idea
 eulerscheZahl: ah, Kniffel
 Astrobytes: You should have called your dice game 3D Würfelspiel eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: not many would understand that
 eulerscheZahl: and Dice Duel is such a nice alliteration
 Marchete: euler in C# there is no way to have a fixed array like in C++, right?
 Astrobytes: Fair points
 Marchete: without new []
 eulerscheZahl: there is stackalloc
 eulerscheZahl: not sure what that does behind the scenes
 Marchete: stackallow is more for internal var on functions, no?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Marchete: not like for a struct{  byte[16] var;}
 Marchete: this is overly complex in C#
 eulerscheZahl: no, i don't that that would work with stackalloc
 Marchete: ok
 eulerscheZahl: also make sure to start your questions to me with "eulerscheZahl how" or "eulerscheZahl why"
 Marchete: why
 eulerscheZahl: not that AutomatonNN is gone
 eulerscheZahl: now*
 Adarshk990: how can i get editorial of a particular question?
 Marchete: ahh :D
 Marchete: I don't want to be rude
 eulerscheZahl: there are no editorials
 eulerscheZahl: just other solutions
 Marchete: I just "left" the question there
 Marchete: without pinging
 eulerscheZahl: and post mortems for contests (but not for single player puzzles)
 Adarshk990: how can i access other solutions?
 eulerscheZahl: have you solved it already?
 Adarshk990: not all test cases
 RoboStac: check the discussion button as well, there are often hints on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: then you can't access it
 Adarshk990: okay
 eulerscheZahl: and listen to robo
 eulerscheZahl: robo also lost the mod badge after the server restart?
 Astrobytes: robo was far too quick with that response, I am losing my touch
 eulerscheZahl: you have to switch to Dvorak
 Astrobytes: Uljahn too
 Astrobytes: re. mod badge
 eulerscheZahl: i know about toothless and clawless Uljahn
 RoboStac: hmm, has it restarted again?
 RoboStac: I'm sure I checked and still had it
 Astrobytes: Not sure. MK seems to have gained it again and a few others seem to have lost it.
 KalamariKing: MadKnight was mod for a bit, idk about now tho
 KalamariKing: is Automaton2000 down?
 Automaton2000: i hate you so much
 eulerscheZahl: sadly no
 KalamariKing: wow ok guess not
 Alshock: xD Automaton2000 is a hater
 Automaton2000: that's why you have to download the json
 KalamariKing: Ok normally I would just ask, I've gotten used to that
 KalamariKing: But this time I'm asking before I ask because I have a LOT of questions and need to ensure y'all are ready
 Astrobytes: We've won the question lottery.
 Philbot: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it's not an easy task
 KalamariKing: So is anyone at least a little bit versed in NNs in cg bot battles, AND have a lot of patience for the onslaught of questions I got lined up
 Philbot: KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: How do you train it? Like where does the data come from? I assume its done offline, but then how do you get the data from the game to train the bot?
 Uljahn: KalamariKing: i guess you should make your own research for helpful hints on the forum first
 KalamariKing: Probably
 KalamariKing: I've done a little but
 KalamariKing: bit*
 Astrobytes: Did you actually read the Nash-DQN CSB article that s truct linked earlier?
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 Astrobytes: And there are forum resources.
 Astrobytes: And there is a chat history.
 VizGhar: + If you are not yet familliar with searching algorithms (bsf, dfs, beam, mcts) and optimization ones (GA, SA) don't even think of NNs...
 Philbot: how often are NNs used in contests
 VizGhar: From reading post mortems very rarely
 Philbot: figures
 VizGhar: correct me if im wrong
 VizGhar: Philbot 2
 VizGhar: satisfied?&#160;:)
 Philbot: doesn't look like the type of site
 Astrobytes: Usually the case that they're used more often (and more successfully) in multis. Time limit etc
 RoboStac: it's also much easier to have success in turn based board games whereas the contests tend to be a bit more complicated
 Tiramon: it takes quite some time to setup an nn and tune it correctlyand in the end train it correctlydon't think there was a successfull nn in the last contests
 VizGhar: but I haven't seen post mortem that mentioned NN (didn't read that much of them to be hones)
 RoboStac: the only successful NN in a contest I'm aware of was in bitrunner
 VizGhar: Tira... moderator? I've never seen you before :D
 Uljahn: there was one NN during LoCaM marathon by Zuko3D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, re curse did a good job with his BR, and I remember the locam one too - note, both long contests
 Uljahn: exactly
 VizGhar: See Philbot ^^ 2 :D
 VizGhar: Just don't try it during this contest if you are not familliar with it...
 KalamariKing: Yeah ik
 KalamariKing: I wanna start with multis
 Uljahn: there are two ways to get the data: by playing games offline with your own bots (you'll have to recreate game engine i.e. simulation) or fetch game replays from CG through API
 RoboStac: yeah, I guess it depends how you consider succesful - I think there are a few (still probably &lt;10) that got to legend in contests, but didn't really challenge for the top spots
 Astrobytes: Yes, true
 VizGhar: But I believe, with enough time, NN's should perform exceptionally well right?
 Tiramon: only if you set it up right and train it right and don't overfit it .and ... and .. and
 RoboStac: the time / space / power constraints make it unlikely they'll take over everything
 VizGhar: yeah that overfitting looks like scarriest part
 Westicles: It would be interesting to see an overview of all the multis and how different approaches/algorithms tier out
 Tiramon: it's not only the algo you useit's also language and performance and so much more
 Tiramon: also just knowledge how to tweak the language you are using
 VizGhar: I'd like to see some poll for legends only - what algorithm have you used
 Tiramon: i could rewrite my java bots in any of the c languages and i'm pretty sure i won't get them perform as good as my java code
 Astrobytes: And experience in order to tweak the algo to your benefit, an alphabeta in tric tracs hands for instance is far more formidable than in mine
 Westicles: Sure, only a small number of people would be qualified to write it
 VizGhar: And how can you learn it all? just trial and error while working on different bots?
 Astrobytes: Combined with some research yeah
 VizGhar: Not that I'm trying to jump into it right now&#160;:) I need to get better in what I already know
 VizGhar: the research papers are a little bit scarry too&#160;:)
 RoboStac: looking at contest postmortems to see what was successful and then trying that approach is a good way  (as you know a good implementation of that algorithm will work for that game)
 Tiramon: someone said here not long ago ... invest 10k hours into codingand that's not that wrong ... that's about 5 years of work experience&#160;;)
 VizGhar: But it's more like my focus
 Tiramon: so experiment and try to improve  ;)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, expanding on robos reply, that way you focus on one algorithm/approach at a time and can focus yourself on it and research thoroughly
 Astrobytes: *properly focus on researching it thoroughly
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: right thanks... Will see how far will I get during this contest
 Astrobytes: For me the immersion technique works, just eat sleep and breathe whatever you're learning until you get a handle on it.
 Astrobytes: Your mileage may vary ofc
 TobiasA: .
 TobiasA: Astrobytes do you use an external ide?
 gigolo: is it possible to add validators than the number of test cases 
 gigolo: *more than
 Astrobytes: TobiasA: Yes, Visual Studio
 TobiasA: even for contests?
 Astrobytes: Especially for contests.
 Astrobytes: puzzles I sometimes do in the CG IDE, and tweaking parameters I usually do in the CG IDE
 Tiramon: i think i only do some easy puzzles in the on site ide
 TobiasA: is it better than using the default ide?
 TobiasA: am i the only one that doesn't know how to use an external ide?
 Astrobytes: Well, the CG IDE is a lot better than it used to be, but debugging-wise it's a lot easier, and managing large amounts of code is a lot easier
 Tiramon: Just use your local ide and write all in one file and use 
 Tiramon: i wrote myself a tool to merge my multi file java solutions in a way that cg can handle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/tiramon/CGFileMerge">https://github.com/tiramon/CGFileMerge</a>
 Astrobytes: Hmm. Shameless self promotion.
 Tiramon: no just explaining how i write my code locally and source for him to use or get inspired by
 Astrobytes: I'm only joking lol
 gigolo: :joy:
 JoKing: did you ping me on purpose?
 Tiramon: bad name choice ...
 JoKing: seems dumb to autoping without any checks
 Tiramon: it just makes a simple no casesensitive string comparison
 Tiramon: so yes naming your self like words used in common communication isn't a good idea in this chat&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Tell that to my alt account 'Question'
 ZarthaxX: OH mine is Answer
 gigolo: lol
 ZarthaxX: Astrostion
 Astrobytes: AnsthaxX
 ZarthaxX: nice one
 ZarthaxX: and hellou
 Astrobytes: lol hey, how's you
 ZarthaxX: fine fine
 ZarthaxX: you kind sir?
 Astrobytes: Good good. Nothing to report
 Astrobytes: I should be updating my CV and preparing for the contest tomorrow but I'm procrastinating.
 ZarthaxX: ah true
 ZarthaxX: we are about to lose our social life, again
 KalamariKing: Bruv I should be doing my classwork but instead I'm struggling with a stupid error I can't fix
 ZarthaxX: i prepared my CV couple days ago hehe
 Amirparsab90: can someone help me learn java?
 Astrobytes: Nice. Mines is well out of date.
 ZarthaxX: in the process of interviews now :eyes:
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes you look for a new job?
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX soon gonna take over the world
 Astrobytes: Will be soon KiwiTae, Brexit has made my current line of work less than workable.
 Tiramon: Amirparsab90 depending on your knowledge maybe try something like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java">https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/java</a>
 KalamariKing: Amirparsab90 prob not here, but there are tutorials online
 Westicles: Is there consensus on what is best to merge c++ files?  I got this to work but don't like going through js

 Astrobytes: Think there's another somewhere too
 Westicles: cool, thanks Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: np
 Tiramon: hm i even stared that on github without remembering it&#160;;)
 struct: hi
 JormaWuorio: Can someone tell me why if next_checkpoint_dist 600: thrust 0Is not working?
 Astrobytes: because you're not comparing anything?
 JormaWuorio: ah sorry i meant next_checkpoint_dist &lt; 600
 ZarthaxX: HI STRUCTO
 struct: paste the full code here
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 Astrobytes: You should post all your code, without context it's not possible to help you
 RoboStac: you can never get within 600 distance of a cp (they are 600 pixels wide so once you get that close you have already moved onto the next cp
 KalamariKing: Jorna the checkpoints are a couple thousand units apart
 KalamariKing: Not a couple hundred
 Astrobytes: Haha, yes good point robo
 JormaWuorio: i know but i dont want my ship to make thrust go to 0 that much before right?
 Astrobytes: Try it and see
 struct: but as robo said it will never be &lt;600
 JormaWuorio: I thought it was measuring the distance to the checkpoint im going for at the moment.. Im confused :D
 struct: it is the distance
 struct: but the distance can never be &lt;= 600
 struct: because the checkpoint has 600 radius
 RoboStac: it's the distance to the center of the checkpoint
 JormaWuorio: I was trying to make it so it would start to slow down more before than it is with just the angle
 JormaWuorio: okay so it should work with like &lt; 1000 right?
 Philbot: does this website help with your CVs?
 Philbot: i see some mentions
 Astrobytes: Not that I'm aware of 
 Philbot: made a connection when you were talking about CVs and the contest at the same time
 Astrobytes: lol, sorry&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: It might "help" with your CV, in that something on here can *potentially* look impressive to an employer (with all the asterisks lol) 
 Astrobytes: oh in that context, yes *possibly*
 eulerscheZahl: but I have these <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/4dg5hMa">https://imgur.com/a/4dg5hMa</a>
 Tiramon: listing 'competetive programming' an a CV looks always good&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: are you telling me they are worthless? :shocked:
 eulerscheZahl: no shocked emoji?&#160;:(
 orangesnowfox: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and I got 36 upvotes on Dice Duel. That has to mean something, doesn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: 37 even. and 1 downvote
 DomiKo: yes it does :sunglasses:
 struct: more upvotes than any of my contributions :p
 orangesnowfox: ... it means I need to do more CotR and get my score down lol
 eulerscheZahl: yours get approved too fast
 struct: Yes
 Westicles: First they need to invent a job where you use any of these weirdo algorithms
 struct: I threaten them with a ban
 eulerscheZahl: space maze was good for harvesting, took 3 or 4 rounds
 struct: usually its enough
 struct: Amazons took a while too
 Westicles: I'll have that on your desk tomorrow boss, Prim's algorithm should do the trick
 Astrobytes: You were busy though
 Marchete: "I've solved the world hunger with MCTS"
 struct: lets hope the games still have a creator by the end
 struct: of the contest
 eulerscheZahl: i managed to sneak in some dynamic programming approach
 eulerscheZahl: inherited a codebase and an evaluation took about a minute for a simple input. got it below 100ms
 Marchete: add a NN, even it does nothing it sounds cool
 Marchete: if*
 eulerscheZahl: and some colleagues asked me for an easter egg. When you click at the program name in the status bar, it will now change to "Four in a row" and a game field will pop up
 Astrobytes: hehe nice
 eulerscheZahl: the colleague lost to the computer (and the computer declared victory 10 turns in advance)
 eulerscheZahl: resulted in a rage quit
 KalamariKing: lmao
 Marchete: bah, newbies
 DomiKo: nice
 eulerscheZahl: not even a strong bot. that's the MCTS i shared as a snippet on tech.io
 Marchete: a good AI coder lost against every and all his bots
 eulerscheZahl: hm, I could submit my bot now that we have a multiplayer game for that
 Marchete: Bmi2.X64.ParallelBitExtractPopcnt.X64 
 Marchete: that damn new .Net core is powerful
 DomiKo: euler you could
 KalamariKing: euler you can't
 Hjax: i was poking at my othello bot yesterday, all of my attempts to improve it make it worse, which makes me feel like im misunderstanding something about mcts
 KalamariKing: you musn't
 DomiKo: by Smits is already there 
 Marchete: welcome to the group
 JormaWuorio: Can someone give me some tips on what i should do to win without boost? I dont mean spoil everything and give me a super code but some tips to nudge me forward from wood league :D
 Marchete: everytime I try to fix a bug, my bots become worse
 KalamariKing: jorma why without boost?
 eulerscheZahl: that connect4 boss is disappointing
 Hjax: my othello bot doesnt care about the magnitude of its eval function when doing EPT 
 JormaWuorio: Because it feels like a cheat since its a once in a day thing and i dont want to use it yet
 struct: depth 3 minimax
 struct: iirc
 Hjax: all scores &gt; 0 = 1, all scores &lt; 0 = 0

 KalamariKing: JormaWuorio but its an advantage the game gives you. its only cheating if you have it and they dont
 struct: maybe depth 2
 struct: :p
 DomiKo: yeah that bot was really weak
 Astrobytes: Take a look at it euler
 KalamariKing: euler that's just sad
 JormaWuorio: KalamariKing but its an advantage i dont need until eventually
 JLukeSkywalker: jorma, one algo that works decently is to boost if greater than a certain distance away, and slow down if within a certain distance
 JLukeSkywalker: slowing down close makes it easier to turn to the next target
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/546171241">https://www.codingame.com/replay/546171241</a>i lost&#160;:/
 JLukeSkywalker: later though you want to be at 100% thrust at all times
 JormaWuorio: Yeah i thought that would work with boost and i actually got through it now when i didnt put thrust to 0
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: "I Win!"
 Hjax: *timeout*
 DomiKo: disrespectful
 struct: Yinsh getting popular
 JLukeSkywalker: its weekly puzzle, thats y
 Astrobytes: how many new players?
 DomiKo: free CP in Yinsh?

 DomiKo: nahhh not now
 DomiKo: there are two real bots that's enough
 JormaWuorio: Ugh its starting to get frustrating when im not making any progress and i just fiddle with the checkpoint distance and boost amount.. And i didnt even notice any change when i changed thrust to boost

 JormaWuorio: This is my code atm
 KiwiTae: JormaWuorio -3vel i sthe way
 KalamariKing: I used &gt;9000 instead of &gt;800,1. For the meme2. Only long runs get boosted
 KalamariKing: The checkpoints are thousands of units apart, not hundreds
 MadKnight: KalamariKing so when #1&#160;?
 MadKnight: in legend?
 KalamariKing: wdym
 MadKnight: rank
 eulerscheZahl: i'm getting timeouts with 90ms when 100 are allowed. does CG still have these issues or is it me?
 MadKnight: what did u not understand KalamariKing
 KalamariKing: I think its ping, I get that too when my interwebs get slow euler
 MadKnight: i kinda thought the contest was gonna start today
 Positive_coder: HI
 eulerscheZahl: nonsense, the bot runs on their server
 MadKnight: but it's actually tomorrow
 MadKnight: like in 24h
 KalamariKing: MadKnight irdk im slow
 KalamariKing: are you asking me when I'm going to be #1? Probs never
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl u ready for the contest&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 JormaWuorio: Yeah but if i say that only use 100 boost when the distance is that much its gonna go slow 90% of the time right?
 Philbot: inaccurate statistics
 JormaWuorio: Should i make more elifs after the first to modify the speed more or what should i do?
 MadKnight: need to prepare some coffee for the contest
 Philbot: distance doesn't equal percentage
 JormaWuorio: Well yeah but even if the checkpoints are far away from each other.. Or near each other.. Dont know why im having so much trouble wrapping my head around this when it seems so simple
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 where's your 1L cup to fill it with some strong coffee&#160;?
 Automaton2000: now if i could get a higher score
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 pls
 Automaton2000: unless you need to use all the time
 itzluku: haha these python 1liners

 MadKnight: Automaton2000 it's terrible
 Automaton2000: i guess i should look at the code and send it to me
 MadKnight: itzluku so u code in python&#160;?
 MadKnight: it's kinda important for the contesyt
 Westicles: MK, why you talk to 15 year olds about winning contests?
 Westicles: These kids barely know how to breathe
 jacek: :smirk:
 MadKnight: well because that's the classic MK-style trolling&#160;?
 MadKnight: no way Automaton2000, impossible
 Automaton2000: i dont do multi in a day
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i should just quit
 Automaton2000: do you mean by that
 MadKnight: (for today)
 Westicles: I don't think they understand trolling without text written on a picture
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i'm kinda tired and it's just 7pm
 Automaton2000: if you really want to go back and forth
 Philbot: are you really a mod?
 MadKnight: no
 MadKnight: well yes but actually...
 Philbot: were you umoded for spamming?
 MadKnight: .... actually yes
 MadKnight: dude chill
 VizGhar: MK weren't you moderator?
 MadKnight: nono i am
 jacek: *doubt*
 VizGhar: hmm ban me
 Philbot: and how does that work when you spam the chat?
 VizGhar: (crossing fingers)
 MadKnight: i can kick u
 Philbot: kick yourself
 VizGhar: from what distance?
 MadKnight: u just need to refresh the page to get back
 jacek: oh my
 MadKnight: Philbot dude that's actually straightforward bullying cmon dude
 Westicles: I am sensing some animosity here
 VizGhar: :D allright... btw, haven't seen this much moderators online since 1985
 Philbot: you treaten to kick yet you spam the chat see the issue here?
 VizGhar: Chill Phill
 MadKnight: Philbot try doing better than "you're dumb!"
 Philbot: i didn't call you any names
 Westicles: "All my enemies are self-appointed"
 MYH000: can you speak chinese?:joy:
 MadKnight: Philbot is like - "reality can be whatever i want", making false accusations and stuff
 Philbot: is this person really a mod
 Philbot: i find it unbelievable but everything is possible
 VizGhar: MYH000 most of us can't but Automaton2000 can... Automaton2000 speak chinese
 KalamariKing: MadKnight was mod earlier I was here. We were talking about the mods getting shuffled about just after coc went down
 Automaton2000: and i got promoted to wood 2
 VizGhar: see? nobody understands him
 KalamariKing: MK is very much a mod, struc t and astro were talking about that
 MadKnight: lol
 MadKnight: i'll just drop this topic
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 are you still mad at me
 Automaton2000: and a win vs you
 MadKnight: KalamariKing what were they saying&#160;?
 Westicles: I was a mod, but had to quit that when I was appointed ombudsman 
 KalamariKing: MadKnight pretty much just 'mk got mod revoked, persons x and y did too, persons a and b got it back' etc
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine not having haters
 Automaton2000: yeah, i don't like the idea
 KalamariKing: Nothing personal, just that some people got shuffled
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 istg sometimes your responses are great, other times they suck
 Automaton2000: yea haha itll be awhile tho im barely 6gb in i had to wait for the enemy
 MadKnight: KalamariKing that's actually a different story
 KalamariKing: oh was it? It was right after I noticed your mod badge was gone and the coc had just come back, so I assumed
 MadKnight: so they were recently reworking the entire mod system
 KalamariKing: Ooh fun, but explains it
 MadKnight: and they had to re-create the entire mod list
 KalamariKing: oh no
 KalamariKing: they still have yet to fix it?
 MadKnight: well it so happened that i wasn't around at alll at that time
 KalamariKing: or is it just that long?
 jacek: did they re-create div list as well?
 MadKnight: so they kinda forgot to add me to the new system
 KalamariKing: oh rip lol
 KalamariKing: now you're back here with us normies
 MadKnight: nonono they added me later when i came back
 MadKnight: well yes
 KalamariKing: wait nother is a word
 Westicles: All you new guys know you are going to get banned when the contest starts?  Everyone gets a little mean and less forgiving
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is also a word
 Automaton2000: what happens when i go back to your old code
 MadKnight: what's your point?
 retsetera: hey did the event start yet or does it start tomorrow?
 eulerscheZahl: tomorrow
 MadKnight: tomorrow
 retsetera: k
 MadKnight: yea
 eulerscheZahl: in 22h
 KalamariKing: no but 'nother' is an actual english word, not a name or anything
 MadKnight: like in 22-23h
 KalamariKing: its an actual valid word
 KalamariKing: 'a whole nother story'
 JANOWICZ: k
 retsetera: do we start designing our code now or what
 MadKnight: wait it's actually 21-22h this time
 MYH000: I must go to learn my English, or I can't understand your chat!
 KalamariKing: retsetera we still don't know the challenge, that's the point of the contest is that you start designing all at the same time
 MadKnight: 5pm paris time
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know the task yet, starting now would be premature
 KalamariKing: MYH000 glhf
 eulerscheZahl: 4pm actually
 retsetera: ok
 retsetera: just making sure
 KalamariKing: 4pm... utc?
 Hjax: theres no leaked replays or anything this time is there
 eulerscheZahl: 4pm UTC+2
 Astrobytes: No Hjax
 Westicles: everything is a word if people say it enough...
 MadKnight: hmm isn't paris time like UTC+3&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i put my money on a hex board
 MadKnight: no wait it's +2 at most
 eulerscheZahl: no, Paris is in the same time zone as Germany
 retsetera: when does the event start
 jacek: theres video of replay though <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ujeb.se/leakkanaryLoS7dZ">https://ujeb.se/leakkanaryLoS7dZ</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and I know which zone I'm in
 jacek: paris is in germany? :scream:
 KalamariKing: gonna be a nice early 10am start tmr :confetti_ball:
 jacek: habits eh
 Westicles: hex board is too tough.  I predict it will be something unusually accessible to new folks
 MadKnight: okay then i'll just believe it's gonna start in 22h
 eulerscheZahl: reading comprehension: 2 out of 10 points
 retsetera: 10:00am tommorow?
 MadKnight: i forgot words
 KalamariKing: retsetera in my time zone, yes
 retsetera: i am in chigaco timezone
 Hjax: ah youre east coast too @KalamariKing
 MadKnight: couldn't phrase that better because i forgot english
 retsetera: *chicago
 KalamariKing: retsetera look up something like '4pm utc+2 to {your timezone here}'
 KalamariKing: Hjax indeed&#160;;)
 retsetera: where can i see when it starts
 eulerscheZahl: 21h 49min from now on
 MadKnight: eulerscheTimer
 KalamariKing: retsetera 4pm utc+2
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>not sure if that time converts to local time
 retsetera: 4pm in chicago timezone?
 MadKnight: guys just set up a timer on your phone
 eulerscheZahl: says 4pm for me
 KalamariKing: wait wtf
 KalamariKing: who
 KalamariKing: what
 KalamariKing: I should have known damnit
 retsetera: wait the website says
 retsetera: for me it starts at 9:00am
 KalamariKing: It converts to your time zone, yeah
 KalamariKing: So it starts at 9:00am

 [CG]Thibaud: oh I forgot to re-add the countdown
 [CG]Thibaud: fixed
 Westicles: Ah, it is added now
 eulerscheZahl: you removed it when it was &gt; 100 days?
 [CG]Thibaud: yes
 eulerscheZahl: so you are just 99 days late at putting it back :D
 VizGhar: :D :D 
 Astrobytes: :D
 [CG]Thibaud: :grimacing:
 Westicles: Oh, that is helpful.  I think it was on Christmas Island time before...
 DarkLord__28: :grinning:
 MadKnight: well euler was right
 VizGhar: well you need to make contest every 99 days, so that you don't have to think about it Thibaud :D
 eulerscheZahl: already took off the whole time
 eulerscheZahl: boss read may 7th to 7th instead of 7th to 17th
 eulerscheZahl: and quickly approved
 MadKnight: 99 days 23h 59:59:999 ofc VizGhar
 MadKnight: or just clamp() tiumer
 MadKnight: timer
 eulerscheZahl: i like your way of thinking VizGhar
 MadKnight: u guys ever tried Swift&#160;?
 MadKnight: it has some interesting features
 eulerscheZahl: only for the language quest
 MadKnight: it's actually not worse than c#
 Westicles: Swift has a very nice heredoc but the system calls are a little tricky.  I give it a solid B
 MadKnight: maybe even better
 MadKnight: u don't need system calls on CG Westicles
 eulerscheZahl: he does
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl give swift a try
 Marchete: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'm here to compete, not to learn new languages
 orangesnowfox: MadKnight, write / read from stdio literally does syscalls
 Marchete: I gave Dart a try, it was slow af
 Marchete: even more than Java
 MadKnight: it's about simplifying your code eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: and when I only fight the problem and not the language, i'm more effective
 Marchete: then go C# euler
 orangesnowfox: yee, hence me using "Kotlin | Rust" 
 MadKnight: euler is already c# Marchete
 FrederikJuhlAndreasen: c# is trash for code golf
 eulerscheZahl: we finally have .net core and release mode
 orangesnowfox: I'm comfortable with those lol
 Marchete: I know maddy
 VizGhar: Marchete really? Dart is so slow? why they use it for flutter then?
 eulerscheZahl: of course i'll go with C#
 orangesnowfox: VizGhar, because they *made* it for flutter
 Marchete: I had timeout problems with the most basic stuff, VizGhar
 eulerscheZahl: web technology is almost always slow and inefficient
 Marchete: like, seriously?
 MadKnight: well and i wanna just give it a shot
 orangesnowfox: flutter does have aot, but they probably aren't using it here
 Marchete: I mean, at least on CG
 Marchete: I won't code a bot outside C#/C++ ever
 eulerscheZahl: Rust?
 VizGhar: orangesnowfox they made it to replace JS but they failed&#160;:) so they added type safety and now null safety
 VizGhar: and bended it to use with flutter
 Marchete: to hide bots, rust :D
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i'm learning Blazor for work
 eulerscheZahl: they fixed the Rust bot hiding
 eulerscheZahl: it's always release mode now, in IDE too
 Hjax: more like, made it possible to test rust bots without submitting 
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: good good
 VizGhar: I'll probably try dart for this contest (if some hardcore search won't be necessary). Just for fun
 Marchete: I'd try rust eventually
 Marchete: seems interesting
 Smelty: hm
 Marchete: but having C# with intrinsics...
 eulerscheZahl: they are taking big steps towards faster code with C#
 Marchete: a lot
 FrederikJuhlAndreasen: c# is really fast
 Marchete: right now I had a damn NN inference as fast as C++
 Smelty: 21h33m
 Marchete: with AVX2 and all bells and whistles
 Marchete: have*
 eulerscheZahl: *had
 eulerscheZahl: it was so fast it ran away
 FrederikJuhlAndreasen: i saw a comparison with cpp where they werent even using optimized c# and compared it with highly optimized cpp and there wasnt much of a difference
 Aljaz14: I don't even know what i must do:( i am soo stupid
 Westicles: Are there C# jobs?  At least with C++ you can always write embedded phone code if you get down on your luck
 VizGhar: There are C# jobs here in middleeast europe :D
 VizGhar: .NET vs. Java
 <b>**eulerscheZahl gets paid for writing in C#</b></p><p><img src="/a/51696362414566" /> VizGhar: about 30:70
 eulerscheZahl: Oracle starts getting crazy with Java licensing
 VizGhar: hate Oracle

 eulerscheZahl: C# is free (MIT license)Visual Studio costs money but you have a free alternative with VS Code
 eulerscheZahl: which i'm using on my personal machine. I'm happy with it
 jacek: use kotlin [solved]
 Hjax: at least google won the java api lawsuit thingy 
 VizGhar: kotlin rulez... hey Marchete. have you tried kotlin?
 VizGhar: you might like it even more then swift
 eulerscheZahl: I tried at Kotlin heroes
 eulerscheZahl: they sent my tshirt to Germany and I wasn't home. Now it's back to Russia :cry:
 Jesus-Boy: Am New What Do I do?
 VizGhar: :D
 Jesus-Boy:&#160;?
 VizGhar: Jesus-Boy that was meant for euler... What do you mean by "What do i do"?
 jacek: die and come back in 3 days
 eulerscheZahl: you try to solve easy puzzles if you are new to coding
 VizGhar: aw... that was dark
 eulerscheZahl: if you have some knowledge already, a contest starts tomorrow
 VizGhar: I was about to say to grow to be teen
 eulerscheZahl: dark? or biblic?
 eulerscheZahl: bible related. what's the adjective for that?
 struct: any tips for the contest?
 VizGhar: I think you said that right
 eulerscheZahl: why do you ask us? you know the game
 BlaiseEbuth: Submit your code struct.
 VizGhar: struct, just win it
 struct: it was a secret euler 
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: submitting is an excellent hint :D
 eulerscheZahl: no it wasn't. you said you are at 100% CPU for the contest already
 eulerscheZahl: &gt; My cpu has been on 100% for the last 12 hours
 struct: yes I remember
 eulerscheZahl: &gt; I already have my bot ready
 struct: It was all said as a joke
 Hjax: i think not deleting your account helps? :P
 kaboom34568: hi
 struct: But it was true 
 Zongle: biblical eulerscheZahl
 Westicles: scriptural also works
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Zongle
 struct: Damn my cover is blown&#160;:(, my bot is still weak anyways
 Westicles: I don't handle the two different colors of blueberries very effectively
 eulerscheZahl: sorry struct, i really thought it was public before&#160;:(
 struct: its fine euler, dont worry lol
 struct: Its not like when I submit people would not figure it out
 eulerscheZahl: now you have to stay strong and resist the bribe attempts
 jacek: maybe struct will promote to class
 struct: im not sure if i submit my best version or not early
 struct: I dont want to get crushed in a few hours
 struct:&#160;:(
 Hjax: lose to smits in a few hours, read his post-mortem: "i only had 20 minutes on the train to write my submission on my phone, so i was pleasantly surprised that i placed top 5" 
 Philbot: what was your part in the contest creation struct?
 struct: I just tested the game
 Jesus-B: How cAN i pLAY tHIS gAME?
 Astrobytes: Hjax: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: it's your best chance to take a #1 screenshot
 Jesus-B: Can someone help please

 eulerscheZahl: that's how you become a tester
 Westicles: "structs bot is still weak" is actually real information, in the bayesian sense
 Marchete: how many testers?
 struct: 4
 Jesus-B: How do i play this game help pls
 struct: this game?
 struct: you need to be more specific
 Jesus-B: How do i play it
 Jesus-B: Like How Do I Code
 jacek: with keyboard
 Positive_coder: hi
 Jesus-B:&#160;??
 Jesus-B: Ik What Should I type
 ET_BB-8: depnds
 ET_BB-8: depends*
 Jesus-B: Tell me one pls
 DevonGribbin: Hey guys. Hope everyones doing well. Im new here. Kinda stuck on the first coding game - Power of Thor. I get the first 3 test cases to pass however on the final test case I keep going over on the Y axis by 1 point. (the maximum is 17...) Any pointers would be appreciated. I must be missing something.
 ET_BB-8: have you watched videos on youtube?
 jacek: DevonGribbin there is hints on the left
 ET_BB-8: they can help you understand the language you want to learn
 ET_BB-8: once you have the basics you can try some of the challenges on here

 Philbot: i thought chat was dead it then scrolled few pages i'm terribly sorry
 King_Coda:&#160;?
 King_Coda: kk
 jrke: oh so timer is here
 jrke: but this time just a day before
 KalamariKing: Chat is made up of entirely mods, plus me and jr-ke
 Westicles: Philbot, that was my choice in Sunday school when they said to memorize a verse
 eulerscheZahl: don't get paranoid
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/12j88yq">https://prnt.sc/12j88yq</a>mods are shown at the top. do you see the tiny scroll bar? lots of users online
 eulerscheZahl: last time when the contest started there were so many that the chat just crashed my browser
 Esdeathmylove: wtf
 jrke: mods get all online players sorted alphabetically
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that makes tab completion for nicknames a mess&#160;:(
 Westicles: Well, now thousands of people know your DOB kalamari.  Might as well give out the factors of your social security number as well
 Westicles: oops *king
 BlaiseEbuth: "And behold a pale horse, and he that sat upon him, his name was Death, and hell followed him."

 King_Coda: LOL
 KalamariKing: Westicles what
 King_Coda: I don't know my social security number
 Westicles: oh whoops, king is ambiguous
 King_Coda: I can ask my mom though
 Westicles: that's okay, I'll ask her
 King_Coda: want her number?
 Westicles: Er... are mom jokes still a thing?
 King_Coda: Yes
 KalamariKing: Westicles do you want her phone number or the number when she steps on the scale? They're both pretty long...
 Hjax: he just needs her zip code, thats all it takes to find her
 KalamariKing: Oh King_Coda its your birthday! I didn't see that until I read the backlog
 King_Coda: My mom weighs 100 pounds...
 King_Coda: she's very thin...
 King_Coda: And yes it's my birthday
 r123456789: hi, any websites to learn JS?
 KalamariKing: 100 pounds......more than a 737
 King_Coda: ...okay? lol
 eulerscheZahl: or 2.7315952362972E+28 uwhich is a pretty big number
 KalamariKing: r123456789 literally plenty. google it
 King_Coda: eulerscheZahl, i had no idea you were #2 on the site until yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: well, royale took over again
 eulerscheZahl: i saw too inactive recently
 eulerscheZahl: was*
 KalamariKing: I guess you could call it a...
 KalamariKing: #1 victory royale
 Astrobytes: ha ha h...
 Hjax: i envy the top peoples dedication 
 KalamariKing: yeah lol
 King_Coda: Astrobytes!
 Astrobytes: King_Coda!
 eulerscheZahl: at some point i decided that uploading my own nonsense is more fun than playing other's games
 KalamariKing: coda how come I don't get sucha hello
 King_Coda: because KalamariKing, you're not Astro
 King_Coda: Anyways Astro, I would like that badge now
 Astrobytes: *medal
 King_Coda: *medal, yes
 eulerscheZahl: which medal?
 King_Coda: Where's my birthday medal?
 Astrobytes: I didn't say anything about you getting one.
 imatuber: hi
 Astrobytes: I just asked if you wanted one.
 KalamariKing: Hello imatuber!
 imatuber: i am a new coder
 King_Coda: WHAt?
 imatuber: yes
 King_Coda: Hi a new coder, I'm dad
 King_Coda: but Astro!
 imatuber: hahahaha
 King_Coda: It's my birthday :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: congrats for surviing another year and not getting killed by a car or the pandemic King_Coda
 King_Coda: I want my medal! :angry:
 KalamariKing: are those the only two causes of death
 King_Coda: :rofl: thanks Zahl
 Astrobytes: There's not much else to celebrate. And soon birthdays will become irrelevant to you, so make the most of it now.
 King_Coda: *gasp* I'm gonna get a job!
 King_Coda: M O N E Y
 King_Coda: :money_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: i would forget my own birthday if my mom wouldn't remember me
 KalamariKing: astro thats rather depressing, why not be   h a p p y
 Hjax: why make money when you can spend 100 hours earning a tshirt?
 Astrobytes: I usually do forget until the day comes.
 King_Coda: YES
 King_Coda: t-shirt
 eulerscheZahl: 100 hours? I can get one in 70h :muscle:
 KalamariKing: t-long
 KalamariKing: King_Coda pfp change?
 King_Coda: Zahl: :nerd:
 Philbot: get a job with paid leave hjax
 King_Coda: KalamariKing: Yeah, this is my real face
 KalamariKing: i see
 King_Coda: probably only temporary though, that K is my trademark
 KalamariKing: what k
 King_Coda: The K onmy old pfp
 King_Coda: I'll probably get my job after june 16th, since thats when school ends
 King_Coda: doing school and work sooounds like a chore i'm not ready for yet
 Hjax: value your free time while you can
 Hjax: it doesnt get better as you get older 
 KalamariKing: oh it's very much a chore
 King_Coda: YEah, you dont need to tell me twice
 KalamariKing: you're telling me this is the best time of my life
 Hjax: college was the best imo, your mileage may vary 
 KalamariKing: ok good
 KalamariKing: this sucks
 King_Coda: LOL
 Hjax: in college you only have a couple hours of class per day 
 KalamariKing: and you can choose your schedule, to a degree
 Hjax: so if you are efficient at getting your work done, you end up with a ton of free time 
 King_Coda: Well I do online school, and i can get all of my assignments done in an hour
 DomiKo: "Hjax 07:54PMin college you only have a couple hours of class per day " where tell me
 Hjax: lol what do you mean DomiKo
 DomiKo: I have no life in college :cry:
 struct: DomiKo Portugal
 Hjax: in my undergrad on a given day i probably only spent 3 or 4 hours in lectures 
 struct: I have like 4-6 hours max
 ZarthaxX: then you got like 1000 hours extra on your own
 ZarthaxX: :D
 DomiKo: I have like 2hours lectures, butttt I have to spend like 5H on assigments
 ZarthaxX: that's the real pain
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 Hjax: ouch, yeah there were definitely times where i was flooded with tons of assignments 
 Hjax: those weeks were painful 
 Hjax: also hey ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: heyo Hjax
 King_Coda: Hello ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: you havent been here very much recently :thinking:
 Hjax: i like that your profile picture is a different fox with a hat now 
 ZarthaxX: much*
 ZarthaxX: hi King_Coda&#160;;:*
 ZarthaxX: Hjax yes, scarfield did it
 ZarthaxX: looks adorable
 Hjax: yeah i kind of ghosted during the last contest, and havent been around since
 ZarthaxX: but was a bear before that tho lol
 ZarthaxX: life is hard
 ZarthaxX: many things to do
 ZarthaxX: but we all come back for that contest meeting
 ZarthaxX: :D
 DomiKo: omg there is a counter!!!
 DomiKo: 20H wow
 DomiKo: can't wait
 ZarthaxX: for no lifing?
 ZarthaxX: :D
 DomiKo: ohhh yes
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud forgot to put it back when the counter reached the double-digits
 eulerscheZahl: it doesn't support 100+ days
 ZarthaxX: oh&#160;:(
 DomiKo: so there should be a contest in every 99 days
 DomiKo: problem solved
 Illedan: ^
 Astrobytes: That's 2 mentioned that one now
 Astrobytes: Petition incoming
 eulerscheZahl: exactly what VizGhar suggested earlier :D
 Hjax: i love how lively the chat is around contests, everyone coming out of the woodwork lol
 DomiKo: O.o
 Astrobytes: Missing a certain mullet
 ZarthaxX: i think it has been a bit more active than usual anyway
 jrke: rocky mullet astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: 'Active' yes...
 Hjax: wheres smits been? i dont think ive seen him since i came back 
 Astrobytes: There is no other jrke&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: smits is just busy
 Astrobytes: ^
 jrke: busy in teaching/
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not, just lazy
 King_Coda: oh yeah, he's the teacher guy
 Astrobytes: With his multithreaded meta MCTS
 Astrobytes: Not teaching
 Astrobytes: :P
 ZarthaxX: lol
 jrke: ohh
 Astrobytes: I jest.
 eulerscheZahl: beta testing about to end, release to a few hundred users in 2 weeks
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm taking off for the contest :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm the only programmer on that project
 Astrobytes: Nicely done :D
 Astrobytes: Hahahaha seriously?
 King_Coda: I'm probably going to spend the rest of the day today learning as much C# as I can
 Astrobytes: You're confident then I take it
 eulerscheZahl: passed the code to someone else last Friday :D
 jrke: euler did you tested SC2021
 Hjax: i see the duck on the signups
 Astrobytes: Classic euler
 eulerscheZahl: no jrke
 eulerscheZahl: getting my priorities straight
 jrke: btw this time they added codingame before spring challenge
 jrke: so its now CSC21
 eulerscheZahl: honestly, I wouldn't hire myself
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 jrke: :stuck_out_tongue:
 struct: How many bugs will it have that I didnt spot?
 Hjax: id hire you, just need to structure your assignments as codingame contests 
 Astrobytes: Are we placing bets struct?
 Hjax: imagine the productivity 
 Astrobytes: lmao
 struct: How long will my bot last on 1st place?
 jrke: bugs you will get to know that under 24 hours
 eulerscheZahl: 12h struct
 struct: My current submit is first
 eulerscheZahl: until Friday morning
 struct: I have a bot that beats it with 95%+ win rate over 1000 games
 struct: My current submit is also undefeated
 jrke: how many testers are there struct?
 struct: 4
 jrke: oh
 eulerscheZahl: the one-eyed is the king among the blind (German saying, does that exist in English too?)
 Philbot: what is the game about?
 jrke: so those 4 are gonna be first to make bronze
 struct: I would be happy if my bot lasts 12 hours tbh
 Astrobytes: Yes "in the land of the blind the one eyed man is king" euler
 jrke: euler in hindi thats "andho me kanna raja"
 Astrobytes: I like the Hindi version best&#160;:)
 jrke: :grimacing:
 eulerscheZahl: in Hindi I only know swear words
 jrke: which one
 eulerscheZahl: watched too much Kitboga
 Astrobytes: the scam baiter guy?
 IvesL: are there any ways to check locked certificate requirement
 ableflyer: guys what is this thing that astrobytes have next to his account name
 Hjax: hes a Moderator
 IvesL: hes a mod
 ableflyer: oh ok
 King_Coda: mod
 King_Coda: dom
 ableflyer: thanks
 King_Coda: moddom
 IvesL: hover over it
 King_Coda: He's also my adopted father, although he refuses to accept it
 King_Coda: AND he owes me a birthday medal
 jrke: gn everybody cya on contest eve
 Hjax: gn jrke
 Astrobytes: gn jrke
 KalamariKing: gn jrke
 King_Coda: gn jrke
 eulerscheZahl: oh, chat continuedI thought my mention of kitboga killed the chat
 KalamariKing: oh hello again hypnotoad
 KalamariKing: if we registered for the contest, shouldn't our school show up? or does the school itself have to sign up?
 eulerscheZahl: only if 5 users are from there
 KalamariKing: oh rip
 KalamariKing: 4
 eulerscheZahl: that school leaderboard is more like a popularity vote, who can mobilize the most players
 eulerscheZahl: aCat usually wins
 KalamariKing: oh interesting
 aCat: this cat is innocent
 eulerscheZahl: giving bonus points for high contest rankings
 KalamariKing: im the only one from my school active here. 3 others are registered on codingame, but they haven't done anything in a while
 aCat: eulerscheZahl this is not true
 eulerscheZahl: but it was
 aCat: some french schools have more players
 KalamariKing: but was it?
 aCat: now we have really a good team
 KalamariKing: oh lmao you pinged aCat
 eulerscheZahl: but you are a university tutor
 eulerscheZahl: more skilled players that you can put on CG
 aCat: but I can;t win alone
 aCat: BTW I'm too weak&#160;;]
 aCat: I can just 'suggest' some students
 KalamariKing: What do you think: should I continue grinding quests and keep dropping my rank OR should I grind out practices and get frustrated OR should I read up on potentially anything for tomorrow and get bored
 eulerscheZahl: suggest them to play or fail your class
 aCat: BTW this semester points goes only for basic AI classes
 aCat: I will be REALLY surpised if anyone from this group will be in out r representation
 aCat: all the others will be hobbyists
 eulerscheZahl: but you worked hard in previous semesters. some students are still playing even after passing your class
 aCat: yep ;D
 aCat: can't deny that
 KalamariKing: no answer, falling back to coc's
 aCat: :proud_cat:
 DomiKo: don't only top 5 counts in the ranking?
 KalamariKing: right off the bad w:l 0:1
 eulerscheZahl: gabbek is not one of yours, is he?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, top5 only
 aCat: nope&#160;;]
 DomiKo: gabbek is from my city :D
 aCat: but we get him to our slcak ;p
 eulerscheZahl: i did some pair programming with him on coders of the realm
 aCat: Oh of course - Dominik always on CG ;p
 Astrobytes: Keep an eye out for Olaf in this contest
 XeroOl: hello world
 Hjax: i was just talking to gabbek, hes apparently messing around with connect 4 currently 
 DomiKo: yes he is
 KalamariKing: jesus christ this is the 7th 'shortest' in a row, no exaggeration. is there something wrong?
 Gabbek: Hello everyone!&#160;:)
 XeroOl: how Important is it that I'm here right when the contest starts?
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 aCat: oh
 aCat: pinged ;p
 Astrobytes: Right on time&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: Hello Gabbek
 XeroOl: is it okay to start working a couple days late?
 KalamariKing: Working on what
 XeroOl: on the contest
 KalamariKing: Contest? Yeah, its 11 days long
 Hjax: you have over a week, so yeah losing a couple days isnt the end of the world 
 aCat: means 20 days too short ;p
 eulerscheZahl: 3 days too long
 eulerscheZahl: i was good at ghost in the cell which was shorter

 ShubhamGautam: whoever want to come
 KalamariKing: ShubhamGautam #clsah
 DomiKo: eulerscheZahl school leaderboard is so much more fun. If you do a contest with your friends, because you can have to fight to be in top5 in school
 ShubhamGautam: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/WQ6hyQQhDwc">https://youtu.be/WQ6hyQQhDwc</a>
 KalamariKing: lmao
 KalamariKing: #clash
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm biased because i don't know any codingamer in real life
 eulerscheZahl: so i don't care about these filtered leaderboards
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Hjax: me either, ive tried to convince some friends to play but they never really stick around 
 Gabbek: same here Hjax, no luck in that regard :D
 Astrobytes: Same. In fact, they never sign up.

 eulerscheZahl: that's the best I could do to motivate someone
 Gabbek: Happened the same with codingame escape when I've tried to convience some&#160;:(
 XeroOl: I've gotten people to play clash of code, but not the rest of the site
 eulerscheZahl: on CG escape I was the one who left the team early
 Zenoscave: I force other students to join

 eulerscheZahl: no ShubhamGautam
 eulerscheZahl: share it on #clash
 XeroOl: the trick is to just follow an arbitrary set of people
 DomiKo: yeah in Uni it's much easier to convince someone o CG
 eulerscheZahl: Uni is where someone told me about CG
 XeroOl: one of my friends is now semi-competent at golfing with lua
 Gabbek: DomiKo did I read your message right? You're from Czestochowa as well?
 XeroOl: which is terrifying
 aCat: especially if you have points to give :P
 Gabbek: (scrolling back a bit to read some previous messages)
 DomiKo: Gabbek yes yes

 DomiKo: aCat especially :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: aCat is small?
 DomiKo: lol
 Astrobytes: LOL I read it like that too euler
 aCat: :joy_cat:
 Zenoscave: astro are they into biomedical engineering and nano bots as well??
 Astrobytes: No.
 Zenoscave: I crack myself up
 Astrobytes: One's a CS grad training to be a nurse, the other is a computational science research doctor thing
 jacek: no bioengineers?&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: So no nanobots?
 Astrobytes: None whatsoever.
 Zenoscave: Booooooo
 Zenoscave: Any penguins?
 eulerscheZahl: nanobots will run out of IP addresses, not that cool anyways
 Astrobytes: Sorry :shrug:
 imatuber: sorry recess
 imatuber: i am at school
 Hjax: beware of the ipv6 enabled nanobots
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/865/">https://xkcd.com/865/</a>
 Zenoscave: what is the address space of ipv6 again?
 XeroOl: 5
 imatuber: 55
 Astrobytes: lol
 imatuber: lol
 Hjax: theres always a relevant xkcd isnt there
 XeroOl: it's actually more than 5
 Hjax: always 
 XeroOl: there's a lot of ipv6
 Astrobytes: HJax: *if* you can find it
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://relevantxkcd.appspot.com">https://relevantxkcd.appspot.com</a>
 Gabbek: okey, registered for contest tomorrow - nearly forgot about it... whoopsie
 Astrobytes: Yeah it doesn't always find it though Zeno
 Gabbek: Btw Astrobytes - slowly making a bit of progress in MCTS&#160;:) decided to try it a bit with connect4 as it's easier. Discovering a lot of things I've been doing wrong for the last few weeks when trying to learn it, so it's going quite nicely!
 Zenoscave: fair but it found the nanobots first try for me
 Gabbek: I'm curious - eulerscheZahl - did you get your t-shirt finally?

 Zenoscave: post in #Clash
 Astrobytes: Excellent Gabbek, that's great to hear! Practice really makes perfect with MCTS, and learning the optimisations along the way of course&#160;;)
 Hjax: until you try ept and your head explodes 
 Gabbek: speaking of optimisations - decided to try a very simple connect4 implementation, just to see how it goes, and yesterday it was around 15-20k rollouts in first turn, now it's 220k... mostly thanks to Hjax and the conversation :D
 Gabbek: such a crazy differents, I was quite shocked... still am tbh!
 Hjax: optimization yay!
 davilla: how did you get 10x out of it?
 Astrobytes: Haha that's awesome. That's what I'm talking about!
 VizGhar: Gabbek what is Hjax?
 Hjax: i am Hjax
 Astrobytes: Hjax: tell him
 DomiKo: davilla you can get even more! 
 VizGhar: :D :D well sorry
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 XeroOl: hjax is a person in the chat
 Hjax: the secret is to not allocate new memory.... ever, especially not with a garbage collected language 
 VizGhar: I though you are talking about some secret algo :D
 XeroOl: lmao
 Hjax: reduce reuse recycle...... or something 
 davilla: oh you have a pool of objects
 jacek: hjaxmax?
 Gabbek: davilla - the most gains were thanks due to getting rid of memory allocation with new; I'm sure DomiKo and others can do much better though :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, keep nodes as light as possible, make a fkload of them, reuse the pool if necessary, reuse the tree
 XeroOl: the trick is to use -O2
 XeroOl:&#160;:)
 jacek: -Ofast
 Astrobytes: Ofast
 jacek: but in C#? :thinking:
 XeroOl: does codingame use -Ofast?
 VizGhar: Where is that forum post with pragmas?
 Astrobytes: No
 RoboStac: jacek - I've been retraining my oware after the discussion yesterday, turns out your method might be 'slightly' better
 XeroOl: Does that make it better to write your program in bash, and then just call gcc?
 XeroOl: if you can get compile time to &lt;1 second?
 imatuber: iii
 imatuber: i
 imatuber: i
 Gabbek: maybe one day I'll try to do something in c/c++, but... that's like in 2 years I guess :D
 VizGhar: C is easy&#160;:) try OCaml... My head is exploding every time I try it here
 Astrobytes: Hm, you'd be surprised how fast you can make something workable moving from C#-&gt;C++
 XeroOl: I wish this website had support for exotic languages
 XeroOl: I would be competing in zig lmao
 Astrobytes: OCaml is cruel and unusual punishment
 XeroOl: out of all the languages I've done puzzles for so far, I've had the most trouble with OCaml
 Gabbek: Astrobytes - can imagine, especially when optimizating stuff it pretty much looks like C++ anyway ^^ lots of primitives
 jacek: RoboStac my method? the inputs?
 RoboStac: yeah
 XeroOl: does codingame use -march?
 XeroOl: I have a lot of __builtin_popcount() in one of the bots I'm writing right now
 jacek: :scream:
 XeroOl: and I wonder if I'm shooting myself in the foot with this
 JLukeSkywalker: the walrus operator has arrived!!
 Astrobytes: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 XeroOl: genius
 RoboStac: without changing anything else it's learnt to be better after about 50k training games - previous bot took at least 10x that to get to a worse level
 davilla: walrus operator in which language?
 XeroOl: python
 Astrobytes: That kind of thing is what you need. Add and remove whatever you need/don't need.
 JLukeSkywalker: python
 davilla: oh we're on 3.9 now? sweet!
 JLukeSkywalker: pretty much only affects code golf
 JLukeSkywalker: but still cool
 jacek: RoboStac and the same number of units/layers?
 Astrobytes: Walrus? The&#160;:= operator?
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, assign and reurn
 JLukeSkywalker: return*
 RoboStac: no, copied your 1 layer as well
 RoboStac: though I did try my inputs + 1 layer and that was terrible
 XeroOl: thank you for the #pragma trick
 XeroOl: you've saved my bot career lol
 Astrobytes: No problem XeroOl
 jacek: noice. finally a worthy opponent on oware
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 RoboStac: so it's now 32*14 inputs of 0/1 into a single dense layer (size 96) into 6 policy / 1 value output 
 XeroOl: are there any good tutorials for MCTS, or should I just go off of all of these academic papers I've found lol
 Astrobytes: Very nice improvement robo
 VizGhar: geeksforgeeks
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/57060/mcts-tic-tac-toe-playground">https://tech.io/playgrounds/57060/mcts-tic-tac-toe-playground</a>
 Astrobytes: And euler's connect4 code (in his profile)
 Gabbek: ^-- damn, you were much faster Astro :D
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: :grin: For once!
 VizGhar: Why is that sqrt(log/visits) so important?
 VizGhar: It's funny. because I've found most of those algos myself, but without those bulgarian variables
 VizGhar: Simulated Annealing is another one with crazy formula
 DomiKo: crazy?
 VizGhar: well not intuitive one
 VizGhar: You are talking to just a little more then a begginer here domiko
 Astrobytes: Search for Upper Confidence Bound 1
 Uljahn: and multiarmed bandits
 Astrobytes: And take it from  there
 eulerscheZahl: I refuse to try and understand that formula Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Stats are stats
 VizGhar: but guys. you are my google :D
 eulerscheZahl: I already did :see_no_evil: when it came to electrons moving in transistors
 eulerscheZahl: btw is robo's new NN really that much stronger? or does smits need to update his book? :D
 jacek: VizGhar so give us your private data
 VizGhar: You'd be disgusted jacek
 Astrobytes: I'm fairly sure he wouldn't.
 jacek: he has 100% winrate against msmits
 Astrobytes: I'm not sure even Smits will come back against it
 Astrobytes: *effectively
 jacek: he really needs to finish that 48 seeds endgame
 Astrobytes: heh
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Philbot: what is the topic
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa/leaderboard</a>
 jacek: and it was I who created that monster&#160;:(
 Philbot: #1 uses your idea jacek?
 jacek: somewhat
 Philbot: i remember your article
 Philbot: and i still wonder why it has all those extras instead of just NN
 jacek: extras?
 Astrobytes: jacekmax
 Philbot: the NN could give the values for the moves without having to expand, simulate and backpropagate
 Philbot: best first minimax mcts NN god knows what else
 KalamariKing: why would you use f#
 Philbot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 jacek: NN gives value, but it needs input for that value. how would it get the input without expansion and making moves?
 KalamariKing: wdym
 Philbot: train a NN that gives values based on current board
 KalamariKing: wouldn't the inputs be the current board?
 Philbot: kalamari i'm impressed
 KalamariKing: huh
 KalamariKing: as dumb as I can be, I've coded a few nn's
 KalamariKing: one of which was for messing around in OpenAI gym
 Philbot: now i am even more impressed
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 KalamariKing: What'd you think before?
 KalamariKing: I actually wanna know
 Philbot: don't take it the wrong way jacek
 Philbot: i find the extra bits useless
 jacek: oh
 KalamariKing: clojure syntax is gross
 jacek: :head_bandage:
 KalamariKing: wait why does ctrl+/ add two semicolons when the premade code only has 1
 KalamariKing: (in clojure)
 Illedan: RoboStac changed to one hot encoding too?
 Illedan: (Oware)
 Marchete: do you think so?
 jacek: yes. scroll up
 Marchete: ow +1.5 points over 2nd
 jacek: :rage:
 Marchete: I don't have enough scroll to see it
 Marchete: so one hot goes better?
 Illedan: Yeah
 jacek: apparently. robo said after training 10x less games it was better
 Marchete: it was probably not your fault, just a coincidence :D
 Illedan: Oh, he needed 500k games for his normal NN to be ok -.-
 Illedan: Makes sense
 Marchete: sharing is caring
 Illedan: I did max 50k games on any of the AIs I tried yet
 Marchete: how's your NN going Ille?
 Illedan: My newest NN finds as P1 that it basically lost instantly :sob: (evaluating the initial state to be -0.9577)
 RoboStac: 50k would probably be top10 below smits
 RoboStac: previously
 Illedan: Thx for that
 Marchete: nice bot Robo
 jacek: nice robot Bo
 Illedan: Maybe I should just play 1000 random games vs Robos bot and do supervised learning on those :thinking:
 Marchete: it could be
 Marchete: but it would take years
 Illedan: Isn't this game small enough to do some decent Book?
 KalamariKing: SHOULD I:- Complete onboarding in every language- Do something sane
 Astrobytes: Illedan: Enter MSmits and the neverending seed database
 KalamariKing: I've already gotten down to kotlin
 XeroOl: onboarding in every language is cheating imo
 XeroOl: but you can do it if you want
 KalamariKing: hey why is it cheating
 KalamariKing: I wanna see if there are any 'better' languages imo
 XeroOl: what do you mean by 'better'?
 Illedan: Meh, I'll say Oware is done for now. Time to prepare my setu for the Contest
 Illedan: *setup
 KalamariKing: idk, I just like it better
 KalamariKing: I wouldn't know I like c++ if I hadn't
 KalamariKing: Relatively similar to languages I know, plus its low level
 XeroOl: sure I guess
 Astrobytes: And you could tell that from Onboarding
 jacek: how can you know that in onboarding
 jacek: :x
 Astrobytes: Hah. Finally
 KalamariKing: I know cpp is low level
 XeroOl: onboarding is just about learning syntax lol
 Hjax: what kind of preparation do you do Illedan
 KalamariKing: I just didn;t know what the syntax was like
 Marchete: what kind of setup?
 KalamariKing: Now I do and I like it
 XeroOl: from onboarding, you can already tell that lua is a perfect programming language
 Marchete: btw the .net C# looks good
 Astrobytes: He massages himself in a Norwegian way, jumps in freezing lakes and stuff Hjax
 Marchete: really good performance
 KalamariKing: astro ...what
 Illedan: How many chars is it Marchete?
 Marchete: chars?
 Illedan: Looked big to use in a CG bot?
 KalamariKing: there's a char limit Marchete
 Marchete: I just ported my NN to C#, I got the same performance than C++
 Astrobytes: I think it says that in the readme Illedan
 Marchete: including ABX2
 Marchete: AVX2
 Marchete: and the Span&lt;&gt; memory stackwhatever
 Illedan: Cool
 Marchete: seem performance oriented
 Illedan: Might give it a look&#160;:)
 Illedan: Maybe this is my setup
 XeroOl: hold up I just realized
 XeroOl: is it possible to do shortest in bash
 XeroOl: with curl &lt;url&gt; | sh
 Philbot:&#160;:)
 MSmits: Illedan oware is indeed small enough to do a decent book, but it will only be a winning advantage if you counterbook specific players. Just like with any other game except maybe yavalath
 Astrobytes: No but you're onto something
 Hjax: MSmits is alive!
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: A wild Smits appears!
 MSmits: just finishing some workstuff so i am done before contest
 jacek: MSmits now do meta against robo
 MSmits: it's easy to do, done it several times before, but i lost interest in winning that way
 Hjax: have people tried to counter getting booked with non determinism? 
 jacek: hypogonadism?
 Astrobytes: Ah yes, remembering why
 MSmits: hjax yes and it does work
 MSmits: but not perfectly
 MSmits: jacek is usually quite random and it takes a long time to counterbook him, but in the end it's still only a few 100 moves stored to get above 50% WR, and thats with a bookspace of 200k moves or so
 Hjax: i see
 Astrobytes: Don't book reBless is the best advice
 MSmits: not to say this is an i-win button. You cant even create a good book without a good bot
 MSmits: or use it
 MSmits: because your bot still needs to finish the game when the book ends
 c_shxrp: when will we get details on the bot?
 jacek: Astrobytes actually thats a good meta. book reBless, reBless rage quits, easier to get to top
 Marchete: reBless :rofl:
 c_shxrp: for the tournament 
 MSmits: you mean the game c_shxrp
 jacek: c_shxrp contest? tomorrow
 MSmits: for now we just have a picture
 c_shxrp: oh ok, ty
 Marchete: di you get the referee by email too?
 Marchete: did*
 c_shxrp: wheres the image?
 MSmits: maybe during the day we get some video or something, maybe a replay
 Hjax: i wonder if the four furry critters in the contest art imply that its a 4 player game 
 DomiKo: pls no
 VizGhar: yes please
 Hjax: they are different colors too
 ZarthaxX: there are like 5&#160;?
 Marchete: with fog of war
 MSmits: DomiKo what would be worse, a 4p or a multiagent game 
 Illedan: 4 player game with fog of war, randomness and step physics. Then i'll rage quit
 DomiKo: 4p
 MSmits: like where you control 10 or more thingies
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: ehhh
 Hjax: make the game simultaneous while youre at it 
 DomiKo: hard choice now
 Marchete: PCR with fog of war
 Nerchio: Illedan you described my ideal game
 DomiKo: don't tell me about PCR
 Illedan: PCR &lt;3 
 MSmits: i prefer multiagent in that case, because with 4p there's a lot of luck
 MSmits:  a far superior player can still lose in 4p if the others accidentally gang up on him
 Marchete: PR1
 MSmits: so you get leaderboard noise
 Marchete: 1 turn, good game
 DomiKo: PCR :nauseated_face:
 Hjax: code of kutulu flashbacks 
 Hjax: i got annoyed during the unofficial contest at how often i just seemed to get unlucky 
 Marchete: I feel your pain domiko
 MSmits: i like PCR, but the 3p/4p part is a drawback
 Illedan: Anyway, I'm off to weep about my useless NN and try to rewrite everything before the contest. gl hf
 DomiKo: 4p is a lot of luck like in Hypersonic
 Hjax: i go left, the other three go right
 MSmits: and the sim is hard
 Hjax: i guess i lose!
 MSmits: DomiKo HS is even worse with 3p
 MSmits: because it's not symmetrick
 MSmits: -k
 DomiKo: I'm not even talking about that one
 Marchete: yeah, assymetric 3p game
 DomiKo: MSmits I kinda "mastered" HS so yeah I know&#160;:( 
 Marchete: yeah I saw it
 Marchete: congrats
 MSmits: oh right, you got to the top wit that, well done
 Marchete: impressive
 MSmits: I saw i was nr 1 for a bit while you were working on that
 DomiKo: yeah
 Astrobytes: A wild Nerchio appears
 DomiKo: a lot of shuffling
 Nerchio: A wild Astrobytes appears? 
 DomiKo: Astrobytes are you stalking? 
 Astrobytes: No, he posted earlier DomiKo, was afk and catching up on chat :D
 Nerchio: i wonder whats more cool, stay top1 gold or be at the bottom of legend
 MSmits: bottom legend
 DomiKo: legend is nice red color
 MSmits: gold boss is so frustrating to have to beat
 jacek: comrade
 Nerchio: sure but at least i am 1st somewhere :joy:
 Hjax: i got stuck at top gold in code of kutulu, would much rather be bottom legend
 MSmits: so far never got stuck behind one, but twice i barely got past it near the end of contest
 MSmits: they're usually very strong
 Nerchio: my bot in pacman still stays top1 gold and to me looks cooler than my sad bots from like potion challenge at the very end of legend
 MSmits: well also considering you dont have months to beat it
 VizGhar: How do you guys keep focused for 11days?
 Astrobytes: Amphetamines
 jacek: cocaine
 DomiKo: don't sleep
 Astrobytes: I mean, coffe
 Astrobytes: e
 VizGhar: aaah makes sense
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: VizGhar the last few contests i didnt stay focused. 
 VizGhar: I'm allergic to coffee :D
 MSmits: it's motivation mostly. I went nuts the first few times
 Astrobytes: Amphetamines for you then :P
 Hjax: yeah the last few contests i havent stayed motivated either 
 DomiKo: coffee is for weak people
 Hjax: i barely did anything for potions, gave up on pacman before the weekend, didnt try OOC
 Astrobytes: I've not been overly motivated either
 MSmits: i remember after my first contest i slept 12 hrs a day for half a week to recover
 Hjax: that was me after utg
 Nerchio: damn Hjax you need to play this one then
 VizGhar: uff...
 Hjax: i put my heart and soul into utg 
 Astrobytes: OOC was good, pacman was just all kinds of no, potions were slightly better
 DomiKo: Last contest I was changing my code 2 hours before the end. At 4AM.
 Astrobytes: You really did Hjax
 Hjax: i stayed up until the deadline, refreshing teccles replays trying to figure out his secrets 
 MSmits: and then kar liso won
 Marchete: wow
 Astrobytes: ah yes, duck, teccles etc
 Marchete: you people take challenges seriously
 MSmits: so do you, you just take more time
 Astrobytes: I don't
 Marchete: correct
 Hjax: somewhat ironically, the thing i ended up finding was something teccles missed 
 Marchete: I'm a marathon man
 Hjax: when i mentioned it to him, he said he probably would have won if he had the same idea
 Marchete: you are usain bolt
 Astrobytes: I like that ethos Marchete
 struct: yes I can confirm
 struct: 4 players with fog
 DomiKo: Marchete then you are the marathon king
 DomiKo: struct
 MSmits: struct how do you know this
 DomiKo: don't say that
 Astrobytes: Hjax: what did you find again? The id thing? Or was that teccles?
 struct: I tested the game
 Hjax: the id thing was the thing i ended up missing 
 MSmits: but you're not allowed to tell us that then
 struct: because its not true&#160;:)
 MSmits: o
 struct: or is it
 Hjax: i realized every top bot always took a radar over a mine 
 DomiKo: lier!!!
 Hjax: so i could cache steal from their radars 
 Astrobytes: Ah gotcha
 struct: I dont feel like cg will do 4 players tbh
 Astrobytes: Donno how you didn't see the id thing though, that was everywhere on the last night
 DomiKo: Last contest was nice
 Hjax: too busy refreshing teccles replays apparently 
 DomiKo: this one will be too
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: the id thing was kind of anti fun imo
 Hjax: the game leaking info like that is kind of meh 
 Astrobytes: If it's a thing, it's a thing
 Hjax: sure, i definitely would have exploited it if i knew 
 Hjax: but i think the game would be better off without it 
 KalamariKing: guys I did it
 KalamariKing: I completed a medium challenge with little to no struggling
 MSmits: well most contests have one little mistake like that
 MSmits: sometimes gets fixed during contest
 VizGhar: KalamariKing now is time for nintendo&#160;:)
 MSmits: One piece of advice, when you go into the contest, dont focus too much on the games' imperfections. Try to just enjoy finding solutions
 MSmits: it's very hard to make a good botgame
 KalamariKing: lol i think its time
 MSmits: much harder still to make it so that the top leaderboard is adequately sorted by submits. 
 Hjax: i think i find it hard to balance my ambitions in contests 
 Hjax: i think i was too ambitious in pacman, and it ended up hurting me 
 MSmits: my biggest mistake is not considering completely rewriting my bot
 MSmits: best think you can do is try some completely different approaches
 MSmits: but i get tunnel vision
 struct: For the first time I can say I didnt rewrite my bot
 Hjax: yeah i really wanted to make my monte carlo thing work in pacman 
 MSmits: oh and i watch way too few games
 Hjax: ah i dont have that problem 
 MSmits: my first contest was quite succesful but i remember watching A LOT of games. 
 Hjax: i watch LOTS of games 
 MSmits: after that i started to focus too much on the coding
 jacek: you can also make up your own goals to keep motivation going up, something like top10 or delete account
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: top500
 MSmits: or just.. .top 10
 DomiKo: jacek nice goal
 Hjax: my goal in UTG was to get a t-shirt, mostly to prove to myself that i could 
 Hjax: im not sure what my goal now is
 Westicles: is struct allowed to tell us whether it is fun or not?
 MSmits: my main goal is to just get legend and anything better is a nice bonus
 gigolo: get into bronze :nerd: 
 DomiKo: in first 30 min
 MSmits: hah, one time i got into bronze on first day, usually it takes me longer
 MSmits: I make the mistake of overengineering my first versions
 Hjax: getting #1 in a language ranking might be a good goal, but if i use java i have to compete with Nerchio, not sure who uses rust in contests 
 VizGhar: I'll get to legend&#160;:)
 DomiKo: I rember struct is really fast
 XeroOl: what are the language rankings?
 struct: im fast?
 VizGhar: pick Bash Hjax :D
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: Hjax dbd r prolly
 MSmits: and he's good
 jacek: faster than class
 XeroOl: does it only count as #1 at the end of the competition?
 Hjax: does he play contests? i know hes amazing at board games 
 XeroOl: or can you just be early and get #1
 Marchete: 50 hours of high level coding for a lousy tshirt :D
 MSmits: he's amazing at optims and very good at board games
 JBM: and a nice guy too
 MSmits: yea
 Westicles: He somehow cheated at 2048.  That score is impossible
 DomiKo: Marchete you could try 100 hours for canvas
 Hjax: yeah i wouldnt expect to beat him in a contest hes taking seriously 
 Hjax: im still a relative beginner with rust 
 XeroOl: ouch, rust
 Hjax: and hes better than me even without a language handicap 
 MSmits: hmm, i'm not sure how often he is top 5 Hjax
 MSmits: will have to check
 Astrobytes: yeah +1 for dbd r
 JBM: rust isn't supposed to be a language handicap
 Hjax: i mean, its a handicap for me 
 JBM: yeha that ok
 Hjax: but even if i wasnt handicapped, i couldnt beat dbd r 
 MSmits: his best rank is 5th, code a la mode
 XeroOl: use rust if you're scared of debugging
 MSmits: but he's very constant
 MSmits: like euler i think
 Astrobytes: Don't be like EveningRust and fight the language for the whole contest
 Astrobytes: JBM o/
 MSmits: so yeah you can beat him with rust Hjax, if you have the right ideas for this game
 XeroOl: depending on if it's going to be super brute forcey, I'll probably use c++ or lua
 MSmits: (and he doesnt)
 JBM: heya astroes \o howzit going
 Hjax: i do prefer games where the winner has to be clever instead of just efficient 
 Astrobytes: Same sht different day but a little more stirred up than usual JBM, and yourself?
 JBM: yeah we all do
 Hjax: like no one was going to win at potions with python3 
 Marchete: -3vel :D
 XeroOl: python3 is too OP
 JBM: -3vl *is* a good example of that
 struct: I dont think python will ever win a contest though
 MSmits: Hjax almost all contest games are about cleverness
 JBM: Astrobytes: haskell may actually get an upgrade i'm so stoked
 MSmits: have not seen one where performance was the winning factor tbh
 King_Coda: My goals are beyond your understanding
 XeroOl: are all the previous contest winners in fast languages?
 KalamariKing: chat is blowing up, huh
 Astrobytes: JBM: Yes, I've been following the threads on the forum :D
 Hjax: performance isnt the winning factor, but you need some baseline to be competitive 
 struct: MSmits code a la monde
 JBM: take cover
 struct: #1 was C# and 2nd py3
 MSmits: yeah thats my point struct
 Hjax: i think utg was winnable with python 
 XeroOl: I've heard good things about C# but I don't want to learn it
 KalamariKing: astro I tried haskell and... why
 JBM: yeah ok i do have some work up my plate, and prolly a but of coordination too
 struct: ah yes
 JBM: then again i'm on holiday
 struct: Sorry
 Westicles: Does Haskell have important new features, or is it just a respect thing?
 Marchete: imo C# can compete in performance
 MSmits: Hjax sure, some contests are not winnable with python, but they are all winnable with C#
 Marchete: on the pother hand py3 is impressive
 MSmits: even if you're potentially 2x slower
 XeroOl: haskell could be fun, but I'm not smart enough to use it in a conntest
 JBM: Westicles: both
 XeroOl: maybe in a bot game after the contest, where I'm not pressed for time
 ZarthaxX: haskell no way lol
 KalamariKing: imagine someone wins with lua
 XeroOl: that's what I'm gonna do
 XeroOl:&#160;:)
 JBM: it's late like 6 major versions on GHC
 JBM: and the respect thingy
 XeroOl: let's do some lua programming
 XeroOl: it's gonna be great
 KalamariKing: what if we all band together and everyone on cg uses lua
 Astrobytes: KalamariKing: Why *not* Haskell?
 MSmits: KalamariKing if you're winning with some other language and your bot is not a search bot, but mostly heuristic, just convert it to lua on the last day&#160;:)
 XeroOl: it's hard to convert things to lua
 KalamariKing: solution: lua from day 0
 XeroOl: ^
 XeroOl: that's what I'm going to do
 Hjax: maybe ive just have self imposed fear of everyone elses searching prowess 
 MSmits: why is it hard?
 Westicles: JBM, I think it is a great precedent helping CG with things that are usually internal.  Frankly, they could farm out quite a bit more actual work to regular folks here
 XeroOl: mark my words
 RoboStac: lua indexes arrays starting from 1 so it's not a real language
 XeroOl: lua doesn't have int data type
 KalamariKing: Hjax same lol
 MSmits: true RoboStac
 KalamariKing: RoboStac lmao
 JBM: Westicles: wholly agree
 Astrobytes: Hard to convert because other languages scream and run away from being converted
 XeroOl: lua doesn't have class system
 JBM: (hence the "stubs" prompt)
 XeroOl: lua doesn't have string.split
 KalamariKing: I genuinely wonder why, lua is awesome
 JBM: they suck ass in haskell, but probaby also in many other languages
 XeroOl: join me in lua on this competition please
 XeroOl: I love lua so much
 Astrobytes: Westicles: Yep. It's been suggested many a time
 KalamariKing: never used lua lol
 KalamariKing: lets do it
 KalamariKing: this is my first comp so no guarantee I'll stay there, but my first bot is gonna be in lua
 MSmits: I mostly pick c++ for contests these days in case performance matters, but it depends on how complicated the game is
 DomiKo: c++ is always a good choice
 XeroOl: yeah, I'm going to do lua if it doesn't look on the surface like a performance game
 JBM: is it ever
 MSmits: mmh i am not very good with the complex sim stuff in c++
 MSmits: bitboarding sht is easy, but classes and derivative classes and such gets harder
 JBM: low-level languages are dangerous with anything complex
 XeroOl: I am going to write an algorithm whose control flow is built out of lua coroutines
 davilla: do we have anything more than concept artwork at this point?
 struct: no
 JBM: next contest?
 JBM: when is it?
 Hjax: tomorrow
 JBM: OH
 XeroOl: 18 hours ish
 JBM: ho ok
 XeroOl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021</a>
 JBM: i mean
 KalamariKing: yeah lol
 JBM: i *am* on holiday
 KalamariKing: rather soon
 JBM: so lemme schedule something completely different
 JBM: to stream when it starts
 MSmits: JBM you mean off work, or actually somewhere other than home
 JBM: MSmits: lol
 JBM: i mean off work
 MSmits: ah ok
 JBM: as opposed to
 Hjax: i feel like my rust is workable, but i also feel like i write it like its java, im not familiar enough with rust idioms 
 Astrobytes: I highly recommend JBMs Haskell streams btw
 JBM: i spent last month at work, somewhere other than home
 MSmits: well i competed in a contest from a themepark hotel once so..
 Astrobytes: And he didn't pay me to say that
 JBM: yeah nobody likes my cubing streams
 JBM: hey, i did get that last UArray to work
 Astrobytes: You do some cubing while Haskelling though
 JBM: on westicles' puzzle
 JBM: so i'll get to completing it tomorrow
 JBM: yeah that happens
 JBM: hey while you're here
 JBM: would you still have the lniks to the TVC merch pix?
 JBM: i had a request on #fr and lost the links
 MSmits: well i want to finish this work stuff before i sleep, so hf all. I won't be chatting till my first full bot version is done so it'll be a few days. You'll see me on the leaderboard somewhere though...
 Astrobytes: hmmm, I don't believe so
 JBM: ok
 Astrobytes: They were epic
 Astrobytes: hang on
 Hjax: cya smits, good luck in the contest! 
 MSmits: you too
 KalamariKing: OH MY GOD
 JBM: or at least
 KalamariKing: IM DOING IT
 JBM: what was even the site's name
 JBM: KalamariKing: YEAH
 Astrobytes: Nope, I don't believe I saved it, or if I did, I lost it.
 KalamariKing: I solved a puzzle without struggling, twice in a row now!
 JBM: you rock!
 KalamariKing: They normally take me 7-8 hours of debugging
 KalamariKing: Ik, I'm great at programming
 JBM: you so are
 KalamariKing: The amount of stupid oversights I normally encounter is astounding
 Astrobytes: JBM: the link isn't in dbd r's chat log is it?
 XeroOl: which difficulty of puzzle?
 JBM: of course it is
 Astrobytes: Or did that come after?
 KalamariKing: medium, shut up
 JBM: which date?
 XeroOl: nice, medium
 Astrobytes: Pff! Damned if I know :D
 JBM: heh
 Astrobytes: It does have search functionality
 JBM: so what are we lookin' for?
 KalamariKing: hypothesis: a second all-nighter tonight, a straight 72 hours without sleep, will make me even BETTER at programming for tomorrow's contest
 davilla: the difficulty is often off, medium puzzles can actually be easy or hard
 Astrobytes: troll underwear?
 Astrobytes: merch/merchandise?
 JBM: davilla: do comment about it on the forum or the puzzle's contribution page
 JBM: underwear is a good keyword
 KalamariKing: Oh they're all over the place JBM
 davilla: yes I do
 Astrobytes: I can't remember if you sent me it in pm or whether it was in World
 davilla: when will I be able to edit?
 davilla: how high level?
 JBM: lvl29 IIRC
 Astrobytes: I think you posted it publicly in #fr though
 JBM: seemed high at the time
 JBM: did I?
 JBM: seemed like more of a #wld topic
 Astrobytes: I don't know
 davilla: I've been coasting for a couple of weeks now, leveling up just with new contributions, very few solves
 JBM: oh well
 Astrobytes: But some #fr people knew of it iirc
 KalamariKing: I need to pass the weekly challenge for the quest map but st​ruct here made it impossible -_-
 JBM: if anybody finds it, pb4 hasn't seen it yet, y'all got my blessing to share it to him
 JBM: cuz pb4 *is* kind of someone special wrt tvc
 Astrobytes: With his probability-based solution
 JBM: i'm not sure any other is worth anything
 JBM: then again
 Astrobytes: or whatever it was, I forget
 JBM: got notified for him posting a bug repost
 JBM: "i'm not first anymore FX IT"
 Astrobytes: heh!
 Astrobytes: Are you still getting XP from it btw?
 JBM: yeah
 JBM: like 40XP every 30 days
 JBM: when it's on top of the list
 JBM: well it's better than nothin, right
 JBM: pays for the clicking to get it published again
 KalamariKing: imagine getting free xp
 jacek: its like passive income
 JBM: jacek: yeah, so exactly no, read again
 davilla: that's what it feels like when your contributions are accepted, and you log in after a few days and you're up a level
 Westicles: JBM, you did 5D Chests in Haskell?
 JBM: in the middle of it
 JBM: (was on stream too)
 Westicles: oh cool, is that archived somewhere I can watch?
 JBM: got a bit sidetracked with unboxing V5s
 JBM: oh
 JBM: errr
 JBM: gimme a place to upload
 JBM: but i've delisted it from twitch
 JBM: too much privacy invasion
 Astrobytes: pronhub
 Astrobytes: I jest
 JBM: so i completed (off stream) the unboxing of V5 arrays
 JBM: and i'll be back to moaning about the unclear definition of what bounds a room again on stream tomorrow
 Westicles: heh heh
 JBM: take care
 JBM: i'll only cast my vote when i'm done
 JBM: but for now, it's 2* "unclear"
 Kr3sZ: I got a question. How would a C# or a C++ coder beat a Python coder at Clash, in the shortest code challenge?
 XeroOl: learn ruby
 KalamariKing: Good question
 JBM: (with additional anger for "not my first pick")
 Kr3sZ: :thonk:
 Westicles: ha, you'd have to be in some kind of pedantic cranky mode for it to be unclear :P
 KalamariKing: C# and C++ both need libraries, classes, types, etc whereas python doesnt
 JBM: not at all
 Kr3sZ: you are right.
 JBM: ts'a simple matter of "what bounds a room"
 Westicles: Even the built-in python function knew how to do it
 JBM: walls? or dimensional constraints?
 KalamariKing: Question: How would one go about building a search tree
 XeroOl:&#160;????
 KalamariKing: Not looking for copy-paste code, but instead an explanation of what needs to be done
 Hjax: recursion
 JBM: node by node
 JBM: Hjax: damn you your answer is better
 Astrobytes: I give up searching chat logs
 jacek: oO
 JBM: yeah ikr
 KalamariKing: Recursion like function calling itself?
 KalamariKing: Epic I can do that
 JBM: like,
 JormaWuorio: How am i supposed to know which factories i have units in at the beginning of ghost in the cell?
 JBM: you're the coder
 JormaWuorio: and how many
 Hjax: def search(depth):
 JBM: don't play gitc
 JBM: it sucks
 Hjax: er, depth - 1 
 JBM: how is ur csb
 KalamariKing: did you just write that rn
 Astrobytes: heh
 Hjax: my pseudocode sucks 
 KalamariKing: its pretty much python
 davilla: sorry JormaW I haven't done that one yet
 KalamariKing: change = to == and it will run in python
 Hjax: python is the first language i learned 
 Hjax: so yes my pseudocode is somewhat syntactically correct python 
 Astrobytes: No, python is pretty much pseudo, get it the right way round
 KalamariKing: lmao you have a point asto
 KalamariKing: astro*
 JormaW: ive gotten to wooden league something on csb.. got frustrated on that too even though i love the concept
 <b>**Astrobytes runs and hides</b></p><p><img src="/a/55595180001313" /> Westicles: Walls or dimensional constraints?  I mean, you know you can only move in certain ways and the walls block you
 JBM: the walls and te constraints
 JBM: let's make it 1D
 JBM: what were the symbols
 JBM: there's no symbol
 JBM: 1011101
 JBM: how many rooms? 1 or 3?
 Westicles: 3
 JBM: ouch
 JBM: so "dimensional constraints"
 JBM: and my code and yours disagree ^^'
 JBM: all right
 Westicles: 0 is a wall?
 JBM: well i'm not touching that with a 9-ft pole tonight anyway
 JBM: 1 is gold
 Hjax: KalamariKing the big idea is that you dont actually construct a tree, its implicitly constructed in memory through recursion 
 KalamariKing: that seems rather hard for my small brain
 KalamariKing: a state machine is just a function whose result depends on its past results, right
 KalamariKing: if that makes sense
 Astrobytes: wrt not actually constructing a tree, that's not necessarily true depending on the algo
 jacek: not contructring tree? mcts folks dont agree
 Hjax: fair, in minimax / alphabeta at least 
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Hjax: probably should get that solid before attempting mcts
 Westicles: Hikari found a nifty python solution.  There is a build in function import scipy.ndimage that counts the rooms automatically
 Astrobytes: lol
 Westicles: multidimensional image processing
 Hjax: imagine solving something with just scipy &gt;_&gt;
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/353/">https://xkcd.com/353/</a>
 orangesnowfox: lol
 Hjax: from scipy import pr2pr2.run()
 Astrobytes: lol the munkres
 Kr3sZ: I still hate shortest mode &gt;:c
 Kr3sZ: I'm always getting it.
 KalamariKing: Shortest mode is amazing
 Hjax: shortest is my favorite one 
 Astrobytes: Do puzzles then
 Kr3sZ: oh
 KalamariKing: lmao immediate shutdown
 MadKnight: Kr3sZ just switch to python/ruby
 Hjax: reverse is the one i hate, sometimes i miss the plot and end up being really slow 
 Kr3sZ: i just dont like it because python coders are too good in being short :D
 B-612: hi
 KalamariKing: Hello!
 jacek: maybe they have short pythons
 jacek: ba dum tss
 Marchete: perl is like "&lt;&gt;%$·" done!
 KalamariKing: marchete lol
 Astrobytes: jacek dear or dear
 Astrobytes: *oh
 Kr3sZ: c# is like Console.WriteLine("Being Done :DDD");
 Westicles: JBM still there?  What time is the stream tomorrow?  I gotta see that
 JBM: like i got a schedule
 Kr3sZ: wake up JBM
 Kr3sZ: nice
 JBM: you wake up Kr3sZ
 Kr3sZ: oh, okey then
 B-612: can somebody help me about writing regexp function code for this chars "(),*,|,concatination)
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we gotta watch JBM stream
 Automaton2000: i mean i know how many turns it takes to get to the next level
 JBM: y
 JBM: all do
 MadKnight: StreaBM
 JBM: missing some J there
 KalamariKing: StreaJBM
 Astrobytes: Usually you indicate in fr or on the forum for stream JBM right?
 MadKnight: JeaBM
 JBM: used to
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 wait so then how many does it take
 JBM: but that was before the casual streaming time
 Automaton2000: and like i said, i don't know how to code
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 Kr3sZ: where are you streaming jbm?
 JBM: best bet is to follow my twitch
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 youre a bot you ARE code
 Astrobytes: From his computer
 Automaton2000: no i dont think i can still have a lot of time
 JBM: but you'll have to filter out the speedcubing if that's not your thing
 Kr3sZ: haha funny fun goes brr
 Kr3sZ: now for real
 Kr3sZ: twitct?
 Kr3sZ: *twitch
 King_Coda: Yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah I follow it already
 JBM: "cg_JBM"
 Kr3sZ: thanks
 JBM: totally inspirational
 Westicles: speedcubing?  Is that like some world of fortnite minecraft thing?
 JBM: can't regret or your money back
 JBM: Westicles: EXACTLY! just without the nite, minecraft or fort
 Astrobytes: Come on Westicles
 King_Coda: WORLD OF FORTNITE MINECRAFT
 Kr3sZ: fortcraft?
 Kr3sZ: jeezus
 King_Coda: Coming to the app store
 Astrobytes: "LSP situation" just made me think of Lumpy Space Princess from Adventure Time JBM. As a 38 year old I find that amusing.
 Astrobytes: (re. forum post)
 JBM: yeah i figured
 Astrobytes: It triggered my cartoon-watching days from when my niece and nephews were younguns 
 jacek: you watch kids show? shame on you
 JBM: or he did 35 years ago
 Astrobytes: Tbh, that was a good show
 jacek: i know that show watched few eps
 Astrobytes: That and... the Amazing Gumball Adventures
 Astrobytes: *Amazing Adventures of Gumball
 jacek: or my small horse
 Astrobytes: And The Regular Show (starring Mark Hamill as a mystical Yeti)
 JBM: i'm gonna need to google translate each and every one of those individually
 Astrobytes: No jacek. Always no.
 jacek: regular show? this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/EwZHpvq.png">https://i.imgur.com/EwZHpvq.png</a>
 Astrobytes: Mordecai never went near a pony. That's just weird.
 jacek: thats pegas
 Kr3sZ: CodinGame devs should make a desktop version of the website, I would love it :D
 Astrobytes: The Regular Show was weird enough without adding in strange pony things
 Westicles: Has thib done a stream lately?  I follow him but never got a notification he is on 
 KalamariKing: bender ep 1 sucks
 KalamariKing: its not hard, just a lot
 Astrobytes: Don't think so Westicles, he does them when on holiday usually iirc
 Westicles: never mind, I should be good to go now to spam JBM
 Astrobytes: With...?
 Westicles: for his twitch stream tomorrow for 5D Chests
 Westicles: with my high school french
 jacek: anime chests are only 2D
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Astrobytes: He'll probably just laugh at you then ignore you
 Astrobytes: Unless it's meaningful
 JBM: Westicles: if you're on a lucky day, no highschool french needed
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Westicles: Thank god.  It took a whole year to figure out our teacher wasn't pronouncing the name of the textbook (nous tous) correctly
 Westicles: noose toose
 JBM: noo toose
 Astrobytes: My French teacher was a small dragon named Mlle. Meurice
 Astrobytes: I only learned that I liked German better.I learned my French 'skills' much later.
 jacek: oO
 KalamariKing: imagine knowing multiple languages
 Astrobytes: what are you oOing at jacek
 jacek: "I only learned that I liked German better"
 jacek: how does schmetterling! is better than butterfly
 JBM: doesn't sound that bad tbh
 Astrobytes: It was true. Far easier, and the teacher was not a monstrous hellbeast from somewhere fiery and sulphurous
 JBM: it's all a matter of ALLCAPSING it on the meme
 JBM: MARIPOSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 Astrobytes: Yes. German sounds very gentle most of the time and quite pleasing to the ear, until you do the shouty thing.
 fvla: I just remembered the famous Downfall scene
 fvla: Sounds about right
 JBM: still haven't seen the rest of the movie
 Astrobytes: It's actually a pretty decent movie
 fvla: I'd like to watch the full thing one day
 jacek: that most pariodied downfall scene?
 JBM: reminds me i've gotta photoshop my grandparents' photo
 Astrobytes: Since it became a meme-fest I'm not sure how many people have actually seen it all
 jacek: i wonder if i could what the movie seriously after hat
 jacek: watch*
 Astrobytes: Yeah you can, but you'll still remember. Such is the nature of a meme...
 jacek: should do that meme with CG contest theme
 TBali: Hi, what is the best way to prepare for tommorrow contest? 
 fvla: oh no
 Astrobytes: Go to sleep.
 TBali: Seeing Totoro movie once more?
 Astrobytes: No idea.
 Astrobytes: Honestly.
 jacek: i imagine struct being the shouting one about not winning
 struct: hmm
 Astrobytes: Just get your contest trousers on and hope for the best.
 Westicles: It wasn't great but the guy playing goebbels did a good job
 struct: What do you mean jacek?
 TBali: I did not get from the picture it is Totoro
 jacek: nothing ~
 fvla: I'm working on The Resistance rn, and my crappy Python solution times out.
 KalamariKing: Astrochars how much sleep would you recommend? I can't sleep a full 8 hours, I just can't idk why, but 3 hours isn't enough
 JBM: as muhc as is needed
 Astrobytes: 6-8 hours is generally recommended. I am not your sleep therapist.
 fvla: Currently using morse trie
 jacek: try lucid dreaming
 fvla: yes
 fvla: that is perfect
 Astrobytes: Every night, every morning.
 struct: Just watch some CSB replays it should help
 fvla: lmao
 struct: for the contest
 Westicles: Hah, Astrobytes I think KalamariKing has imprinted on you like a penguin
 fvla: oh i thought you meant for going to sleep
 fvla: watch CSB replays until you get bored to sleep
 KalamariKing: Easticles wdym
 Westicles: how many hours should I sleep... lol
 Astrobytes: Seriously
 Marchete: yes
 Hjax: sleep 16 hours
 Hjax: fast travel to the contest 
 TBali: or study forest spirits
 jacek: uct forest?
 TBali: Have you seen the Totoro movie? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/</a>
 KalamariKing: Yeah
 fvla: once
 fvla: Nice family movie
 Astrobytes: Forest spirits? Like pálinka? :D
 TBali: Miyazaki is really great
 struct: Yes, it was a prerequisite to beta test the  contest 
 TBali: After Totoro I looked up and seen several other Ghibli films
 Westicles: I think the blueberries are the forest spirits.  
 Astrobytes: Spirited away was good
 Hjax: i love Howls Moving Castle 
 Westicles: What has the one in Tokyo with the psychics and the giant monster teddy bears?
 Astrobytes: And Princess Mononoke was alright
 Astrobytes: Not sure how many others I've seen
 fvla: Makoto Shinkai, anyone?
 Westicles: Oh, Akira
 Hjax: ive seen Your Name and Weathering With You @fvla
 fvla: same, but I'd also seen his older works before Your Name even came out
 fvla: not many though
 AntiSquid: TBali the art in made in abyss is inspired from gibli, you must watch it
 Hjax: have you seen the movie too @AntiSquid?
 Hjax: Dawn of the Deep Soul 
 AntiSquid: no, only read the manga
 Hjax: ah
 Hjax: i love the anime 
 AntiSquid: manga chapters take few seconds, 2 minutes at most, so i prefer those
 Hjax: ive seen a ton of anime, havent read much manga
 Hjax: only manga ive read is Kagerou Daze
 fvla: manga is a trap
 Astrobytes: It's just like anime but it doesn't move.
 fvla: might seem like you're saving time
 AntiSquid: what are the speculations around totoro? what kind of CG game do we get based on that? lol
 fvla: but it steals your life force
 fvla: particularly ongoing manga series
 Westicles: struct said it is 2player with cards and fow
 Astrobytes: I'm tired of speculating about it AntiSquid, I just want it to appear so I know whether to bother with it or not.
 AntiSquid: i doubt it . don't believe struct @_@
 Astrobytes: struc t also said it was 4 player hex grid with fow
 struct: maybe im not even testing it, who really knows
 AntiSquid: no, hex is his fetish, not the actual game
 AntiSquid: oh damn, he's still online
 AntiSquid: how's your day? nice to see you
 TBali:&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: Why would struc t not be on at this time?
 AntiSquid: idk, i don't keep track of people's time
 TBali: NDA?
 Astrobytes: It's a rare thing.
 struct: no NDA
 struct: just respect 
 struct: or w/e is the word
 Astrobytes: But insta-FU if you don't respect that boundary
 Astrobytes: It's trust-based
 struct: yeah
 TBali: trust is overrated&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: some shit gets leaked that's the problem
 TBali: I once had a CEO that said: "trust is good. But EBIT is better."
 Astrobytes: Honesty is underrated.
 AntiSquid: i just wonder how much gets leaked on this site really, it's leaky i am sure
 Westicles: tbali, 495 puzzles?  you must be close to all of them
 TBali: 15 missing
 Astrobytes: Oh, some boss TBali :rofl:
 struct: Well I can be sure that if there is any leak it didnt came from me
 TBali: but these are damn hard
 AntiSquid: not saying that struct
 AntiSquid: i mean the site itself not people
 TBali: Even ISS has leaks
 Westicles: have you done that deleted optim? 
 TBali: Or was it already mended?
 Astrobytes: Other than emails from Klee disclosing all participants email addresses I'm not sure anything significant has happened through or as a result of CG?
 TBali: which one was deleted?
 Astrobytes: The Great Dispatch
 Westicles: yeah, that one.  turns out you can still do it
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-great-dispatch-disabled">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-great-dispatch-disabled</a>
 AntiSquid: unleash the geek for example Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: but there's a bit more than that ...
 Astrobytes: Oh in terms of leaking replays?
 AntiSquid: anything
 struct: the replays have been fixed 
 TBali: did not know of this.In optim, I still dn't have 100% at bulls and cows 2
 TBali: and search race
 Astrobytes: Also, there is permission to recreate the Great Dispatch as a user-created optim
 TBali: but search race should be easy, just did not bother it so far
 TBali: Also in solo, cca 7 puzzles got deleted due to low score.
 TBali: I solved only 3 or 4 from these
 AntiSquid: search race &gt; convert CSB bot, but watch out they swapped some inputs just for sheer annoyance nothing else
 TBali: yeah I know. I just skipped this, before in mid term I want to remake my php CSB bot in a faster language.
 TBali: And did not want to spend effort on the old code
 TBali: * before = because
 Astrobytes: Moving to Pascal now TBali? :D
 Westicles: yeah, you are ahead of me on deleted ones, and SG is probably ahead of you
 Marchete: ugh
 TBali: It is definitely faster than php&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 TBali: Waiting for the FORTRAN support
 Astrobytes: I expect a decent C bot from you at some point
 TBali: I am investing time in picking up C++
 Astrobytes: wait a sec, Westicles, do they have FORTRAN on here?
 TBali: There was a 25y hiatus
 Astrobytes: Nice TBali
 Westicles: you mean from bash?  yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah. There you go TBali
 AntiSquid: pascal was nice back in highschool i guess, but even back then i envied people from other highschools that were coding C++ instead lol
 Marchete: Pascal was good in 1999, yes
 Astrobytes: Write in FORTRAN, call the gcc FORTRAN compiler and away you go
 TBali: I don't really know fortran.  
 TBali: Actually used it only once in the university, 
 Astrobytes: But you were waiting for FORTRAN support
 Astrobytes: :P
 davilla: I love how Mart Virkus is always making fun of PHP
 davilla: comic author at toggl
 Astrobytes: Hm, 1999... pascal? Really?
 TBali: More like 1992
 JBM: more like 1972
 Westicles: I remember doing pascal on a commodore superpet.  That must have been... a long time ago
 AntiSquid: anyone used FoxPro database thingy&#160;? really old crap
 TBali: I disagree, Object Pascal was decent in the 80s
 TBali: FoxPro no
 Astrobytes: Yeah, a pharma company I used to work for had a whole SMS based around FoxPro AntiSquid. It was horrific.
 AntiSquid: LOL what year was that
 AntiSquid: i mean hahhaa
 TBali: before or after Dbase IV&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It was circa 2013 I had to use it, it was in use from around 2007? I think
 Astrobytes: Legacy ofc
 JBM: ofc
 AntiSquid: this is where pinging Automaton2000 to clear chat from bad thoughts fits best
 Automaton2000: i'm not sure how that would be an array of pointers
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh Fuck Srsly&#160;?
 Astrobytes: They eventually updated I believe (the SMS vendor)
 Westicles: Manufacturer: CommodoreDate: 1981  ouch
 Astrobytes: Anyways, got a very early one tomorrow. Gn all, take care
 BlaiseEbuth: :wave:
 TBali: Mart Virkus - did not know the dude, look funny at first check...
 AntiSquid: contest at 2 PM in UK :o
 AntiSquid: had a long day, maybe i go sleep now too @_@
 AntiSquid: gn8
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah i think it's better if i had to use recursion
 KalamariKing: gn anti
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 you're a robot, help me
 Automaton2000: so i guess it is the last one
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 no its not the last one, my guy there are a couple more than a single question
 Automaton2000: i know exactly what you need to wait
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 then tell me
 Automaton2000: yeah i just said that
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 you literally did not, look again
 Automaton2000: if i can still use it
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 use what
 Automaton2000: why don't you just ask your question? then anybody can decide if it is in a big pack
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 ok fine, chill, lemme type it out
 Automaton2000: could the validators in the repo not have been in a convenient format ffs...
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 nope, that's the challenge
 Automaton2000: if i have to improve mine
 fvla: now i'm sad...
 fvla: I feel silly for trying to do a weird binary search on The Resistance only to realize that my real bottleneck was not using dynamic programming/memoization
 dreadylein: @fyla dont feel bad, i recoded some pieces of code twice the last few days because i mixed up x and y :D 
 fvla: oof
 hyphz: Don't want Fortran support. Want Common Lisp support.
 fvla: wait, Fortran support???
 hyphz: Sorry, joke made above, not a real thing&#160;:)
 fvla: oh okay, hahaha
 fvla: Writing Fortran today is on the same level as writing in an esoteric language lol
 dreadylein: its not the worst language for working tho, there still is tons of fortan and cobol based legacy software around
 fvla: I looked up some Fortran 90/95 code right after I said that, and it's not the worse
 fvla: *worst
 dreadylein: yeah
 fvla: I was very badly scarred by this one time I read older Fortran code riddled with gotos
 dreadylein: :D
 fvla: "Hey, let's take a look at the source code of an old text adventure!"
 fvla: "How bad could it be?"
 dreadylein: you need to look at the fun old code&#160;:)
 dreadylein: wolfenstein and doom are pretty neat
 dreadylein: especialy doom has some realy realy cool pieces
 fvla: thanks for the idea
 fvla: will do when I can
 fvla: fast invsqrt tho
 fvla: (quake not doom, but still)
 mai_chutiya_hu: codeforces or here?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 codehereses?
 Automaton2000: now i have to get up to speed
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 or hereforces?
 Automaton2000: you can use that as a compliment
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 choose your fighter
 Automaton2000: not like i can get to it
 mai_chutiya_hu: denought
 mai_chutiya_hu: BLACK OR WHITE?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 codehorses is mine don't even try
 Automaton2000: no idea why i would be happy to help
 mai_chutiya_hu: BLACK OR WHITE
 MadKnight: BANTe
 mai_chutiya_hu: TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT

 MadKnight: well i tried
 MadKnight: mai_chutiya_hu was not found on the chat.
 Joelute: You're goated
 MadKnight: did it ban him? i usually get a message saying someone got banned
 MadKnight: but i got none this time
 MadKnight: anyway
 megi-san: ay ppl
 MadKnight: so it's 13h 23m until the contest
 MadKnight: u guys ready?
 hexa8: what im goated?
 MadKnight: just get to the gold league and then noone would call u goated 
 MadKnight: ever again
 MadKnight: i think
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is that how it works?
 Automaton2000: i'm not familiar with the coc problem regarding finding the room brian is in? does anyone know
 MadKnight: wait i did the joke wrong
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 just forget it
 Automaton2000: "july 28th (19:44:36) cyberpunk: msmits i believe in your victory"
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 are u logging yourself logging the chat?
 Automaton2000: but i dont have to read the statement
 MadKnight: don't log that, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i got no idea what i'm supposed to do with anything
 MadKnight: me too Automaton2000, me too....
 Automaton2000: hey guys, i have some ideas
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 if any are about the contest tomorrow, I'll need them
 Automaton2000: i dont really have a choice
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 you're right you don't, tell me
 Automaton2000: if they can be used for the next round
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000 ssshhhh no telling
 Automaton2000: right now my highest is 48% in about 1k games
 KalamariKing: Automaton2000 you've already played? Any leaks?
 Automaton2000: if you could do that
 KalamariKing: i gtg now, ggez those sheep tonight peeps cuz we got a contest to win in a mere 13 hours
 joniebear: What horrible abomination is Pascal??? 
 MadKnight: KalamariKing just practice a few of the older contestss
 MadKnight: and focus on the things that u can learn in a day and not on anything that takes a hella ton of a time
 MadKnight: well he probably won't see my messages, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why do u want to do something with that
 MadKnight: joniebear what do u have against pascal&#160;?
 MadKnight: also 
 MadKnight: Zenoscave u still there&#160;?
 joniebear: It crashes my spaceship...
 Zenoscave: barely
 MadKnight: joniebear well u probably got a mistake in your code that u need to fix
 MadKnight: Zenoscave what's time now for u&#160;?
 Zenoscave: 19:28 but I'm getting ready to leave for dinner
 MadKnight: is it gonna be like 08:00 for u when the contest starts&#160;?
 joniebear: Thanks, that worked.
 Zenoscave: yup
 MadKnight: Zenoscave are u gonna not sleep until 8am or are u gonna wake up super early instead&#160;?
 Zenoscave: wake up super early
 MadKnight: nice
 ZarthaxX: Zenoscave contest coming?
 Zenoscave: tomorrow...
 ZarthaxX: not sleeping? :P
 Zenoscave: I will soon
 jayy1050: I'm doing coders strike back and I'm having trouble trying to debug the code
 jayy1050: can someone help? I use Java
 Zenoscave: System.error.println("Thing to debug");
 Zenoscave: debug as in debug messages ^ or as in debug your code?
 jayy1050: oh ok
 jayy1050: that would be System.out.println("Debug messages....");
 jayy1050: oh wait
 jayy1050: nvm
 Zenoscave: nope. use the stderr stream. not stdout
 Zenoscave: If you print to stdout it is considered a command on this site. DEbug messages always go to stderr
 jayy1050: stderr?
 jayy1050: system.err?
 Zenoscave: yeah that. Sorry been a while since I've done java
 Zenoscave: stderr stdout are C / C-derivative based terms. Java calls it system.err
 jayy1050: I typed it on top of the code I was given and it didn't work
 Zenoscave: Whats the error that's being given by the engine?
 XeroOl: what do you mean by "didn't work"
 jayy1050: My pod keeps going the wrong way
 Zenoscave: ... Error messages won't change that.
 XeroOl: so, an err.println won't change your code
 jayy1050: Dang it
 XeroOl: you can use it to see the values of the code
 XeroOl: so, if you're doing any calculations, you could, for example, err.println the values in your calculations
 XeroOl: to see where they're going wrong
 XeroOl: below the video, it will show what your code outputted
 jayy1050: Ok. I'll check that
 XeroOl: You can look at what the code outputted, and try to understand why your code is outputting the wrong thing
 XeroOl: to make the pod go the wrong way
 jayy1050: I think it's because it put in System.out.println(nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointX + " 50");
 davilla: x and x? yeah
 jayy1050: them*
 davilla: you can see those too, in white
 davilla: (the debug stream is in red)
 XeroOl: yeah, I think it's supposed to be X and then Y
 davilla: guys, 12 hours to go
 Lachrymosa: woot
 jayy1050: It works now
 XeroOl: hooray
 davilla: kinda psyched about this, not sure why
 jayy1050: Thanks guys
 XeroOl: someone flip a 20 sided coin with all the languages
 XeroOl: so I can pick a language to work with
 mustardpudding: brainfuck
 XeroOl: sorry, not supported in codingame&#160;:)
 davilla: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://rolladie.net/roll-a-d20-die">https://rolladie.net/roll-a-d20-die</a>
 Lachrymosa: I feel the most confident coding than I ever have before. So this time I feel like it will be a test of my ability and I'm setting a goal to make it to at least mid/high silver
 jayy1050: Bot
 jayy1050: My bad lp;
 jayy1050: lol
 davilla: yeah I wonder how challenging the challenge really is
 davilla: my first, but then I've done some of the bot games
 davilla: still only concept art, right?
 XeroOl: I wish I had the local editor thing working
 XeroOl: so I could edit the code on my computer instead of in the site
 davilla: yeah that seems like a pain
 davilla: you'll spend more time trying to figure that out than working the solution
 XeroOl: I submitted a bug report to vivaldi
 Smelty: spring challenge in 12 hours hype
 joniebear: wait, local editor what? 
 XeroOl: yeah
 XeroOl: in the IDE, click settings on the left, and then scroll all the way down
 XeroOl: "Use an external code editor"
 joniebear: I've set myself a new quest, which is to complete the descent in every language that is supported. Only 3 to go :D
 joniebear: Let me try that, RIGHT NOW
 joniebear: oh, here is VIM too :O
 joniebear:  Oh, with app and extension. I was more hoping for an API and some plugins. 
 mateja981: Yo guys, I an new here, can somebody explane me what to do?
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: You can do coding problems in the practice tab, there's competitions where mulitple people try to solve on problem
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Basically just do coding based puzzles
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Also anyone that's done the Temperatures problem, what does it mean when it's asking for -273 alone and also 5586 alone
 joniebear: Can you link the puzzle? 
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures</a>
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: I solved it and passed all of them but i have like 80some% because of those 2 conditions and have no idea what it means
 joniebear: You need to print he temperature closest to 0 among the input data. Are you considering all possible numbers of inputs from 0 to many?&#160;:) 
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Yeah, I passed all of the test cases and from what I can tell it doesn't matter how many temps there are
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: But I have 2 validators failed and all they say are -273 alone, and 5526 alone
 joniebear: Try your solution when you feed it just -273 then, and see what it does. 
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Awesome, thanks
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Some of my conditions ignored the single inputs
 davilla: Strange that that shows up only in the validators, and not as a test csase.
 FakePencilCase[ForMrTiramon]: Probably an oversight since it does make sense as a requirement, but it is reaaly confusing just seeing "only -273" with no explanation

 ClashCode2501: I have learnt python but want to learn application
 Thelegendkillers: Hola!!
 Miki09: hi
 Ledunce: hi
 Thelegendkillers: alguien habla español?
 Thelegendkillers: oh soy el unico latino aquí?
 jE8448: hYY
 pr0ti[-_]st: hi
 pr0ti[-_]st: good puzzle
 pr0ti[-_]st: I had to think
 pr0ti[-_]st: :grinning:
 Ordonnateur: I feel cheated making 100% on the week puzzle not managing  the add between more than 2 values (case that need to be managed for the test case tho ^^').
 JSboss: ne soy latino pero hablo poquito de la idioma
 JSboss: oh that was a few hours ago nvm
 BlaiseEbuth: Jet lag...
 DJ-ALOK: I am Robin_Hood
 AntiSquid: is that a ban request&#160;?
 MSmits: you can't ban robin hood just because he is socialist. Be politically neutral!
 DJ-ALOK: hey i created a contribution 
 DJ-ALOK: i use full my mind
 DJ-ALOK: can anybody want to view it or no AntiSquid it is not a ban request
 davilla: oh, I just commented. don't worry, it'll get noticed
 Manchi_o6o7: someone who could help me with a scanf problem. It only reads my input once in a loop.

 Greanleaf: link = 404?
 davilla: I can't read what you posted, seems to be a problem
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Si3mZhVm">https://pastebin.com/Si3mZhVm</a>
 davilla: better, thanks
 davilla: which puzzle is this for?
 davilla: or can you describe the issue?
 davilla: it looks to me like it should loop n times, you say it's not?
 Manchi_o6o7: I found the mistake... It has nothing to do with scanf and the loop. The string gets 5 letters, so the array size should be defined to 6, because of the \0
 Manchi_o6o7: I forgot it...
 Manchi_o6o7: Sorry guys
 davilla: no worries, good debugging
 DJ-ALOK: what do you want in my contribution davilla
 davilla: nothing, I was just making a comment about the math
 DJ-ALOK: okk
 HDnox: yo, anybody knows how the score of clash code is calculated&#160;?&#160;? 
 HDnox: nevermind
 Mohamed_Kharrat: percentage solved first, time to solve second. as for the shortest mode its shortest first, time comes second
 VizGhar: Hey guys. Long time no see&#160;:) any breaking (braking) changes since january?
 Puru299792458: Hi 
 Puru299792458: only 95 characters :scream:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Happy Easter
 VizGhar: :D happy easter for you too
 VizGhar: hey Puru299792458 for shortest you have to change language... Go is nogo
 Puru299792458: :sweat_smile:
 VizGhar: I use kotlin by default, ruby for shortest, since i can google 15 minutes straight
 Puru299792458: I got to learn ruby then :smiley:
 AntiSquid: DJ-ALOK solve mine, i solve yours
 AntiSquid: actually your's isn't visible lol can't test at all 
 AntiSquid: did he already get banned again? :D
 Puru299792458: do we get banned also&#160;? 
 Puru299792458: I'm using since start april, don't have much idea about it
 AntiSquid: probably if you claim to be robin hood (the user)
 Puru299792458: aah ..... :d
 AntiSquid: he's special, you're not so my guess is no you don't get a ban
 Puru299792458: I'm solving don't panic 
 Puru299792458: episode 1
 Puru299792458: but its really panicking
 AntiSquid: you can do it!
 Scarfield: Stay calmAnd take the elevator
 VizGhar: you got this 
 VizGhar: One way to solve the puzzle is to read forum first. or if you struggle
 Manchi_o6o7: Is someone capable of helping me with binary files in C
 DaNinja: fopen(path,"rb");
 raghvagr221: hey matews
 raghvagr221: wass up

 Scarfield: without the "_" obviously
 BlaiseEbuth: You pinged him each time :3
 Scarfield: so much for trying to not be annoying
 FleshgodApocalypse: guys can i ask you something&#160;? 
 FleshgodApocalypse: it's a problem 
 ErrorRazor: dontasktoask.com

 AntiSquid: hi, is there anyone here who wants to ask question?
 FleshgodApocalypse: yeah me
 Scarfield: xD
 ErrorRazor: Pastebin is broken&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: k thanks that's all i wanted to know FleshgodApocalypse
 FleshgodApocalypse: why&#160;? 
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys. How can I read one per one byte from a binary file, till EOF. In C&#160;:/
 FleshgodApocalypse: it is forbbiden to ask here&#160;? 
 Nanosplitter: (Just ask the question instead of asking to ask the question)
 Manchi_o6o7: c=getc isn't working properly
 AntiSquid: no, am i forbidden to ask who wants to ask? 
 FleshgodApocalypse: no
 AntiSquid: cool so we can be best friends then
 Scarfield: no FleshgodApocalypse of course not, but just ask your question from the start, no need to ask for help without stating what you need help with&#160;:)
 Puru299792458: :joy:
 FleshgodApocalypse: it's just i am new here , and i don't know the rules quit well 
 Puru299792458: no rules i guess
 Puru299792458: just ask questions and be kind :D
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 what are the rules of codingame&#160;?
 Automaton2000: time to learn new things
 PatrickMcGinnisII: keep you questions under 32-bits please. :P
 Nanosplitter: Good answer Automaton2000
 Puru299792458: and only ascii characters :P
 Automaton2000: oh yes i see it
 AntiSquid: FleshgodApocalypse what's your question anyway? be specific
 Manchi_o6o7: Can someone help me with this
 Nanosplitter: Automaton2000 Can you help them with their general problem?
 Automaton2000: Nanosplitter are you a girl?
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/sBgpyU14">https://pastebin.com/sBgpyU14</a>
 Nanosplitter: Oof
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: Darklord1234 what's your question Automaton2000 will help
 Automaton2000: still i don't know anything about that
 Manchi_o6o7: I commented the line. It only reads 4 bytes, not the whole binary file.
 Nanosplitter: Hahaha
 AntiSquid: doing free answer giveaway
 AntiSquid: which puzzle is that Manchi_o6o7
 Manchi_o6o7: it is not a puzzle
 AntiSquid: ok what are you trying to achieve?
 tarapitha: Manchi_0607, how do you call the getc?
 Scarfield: line 33 lacks {} after if no(?)
 AntiSquid: it's tucked in ^
 AntiSquid: hidden 
 Manchi_o6o7: I am trying to read from a binary fail, the fails contains DEFGHKRKEKRK etc. Some string.
 Manchi_o6o7: But it only return the four first chars
 Manchi_o6o7: DEFG for example
 FleshgodApocalypse: Antisquid thx m8,no need. now i think i've got the general idea behind  what i was about to ask 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Manchi_o6o7 check your file encoding.  Open file in a hex editor, you'll prolly find a 0, which is reading as an EOF instead of an extended or non-UTF8 charset
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Reading a single byte is kinda dumb, maybe think about a stream
 Manchi_o6o7: i am trying to do it
 Manchi_o6o7: with fread 
 AntiSquid: ifstream input( "C:\\Final.gif", fstream::binary );  
 AntiSquid: shouldn't it be something like that&#160;?
 Manchi_o6o7: but then I get just one character
 AntiSquid: with fread put it in a while loop 
 AntiSquid: no&#160;?
 Manchi_o6o7: while(fread(&amp;c,sizeof(c),1,in)){
 Manchi_o6o7: like this&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: oh right, sorry code is a bit ugly
 Manchi_o6o7: I have no idea how to fix it. Because I don't know how mucb bytes I should read.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/eof-getc-and-feof-in-c">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/eof-getc-and-feof-in-c</a> i didn't use C that much see if this helps
 Manchi_o6o7: still having trouble
 tarapitha: Just an idea, could you try %02X instead of %c in printf?
 tarapitha: Maybe the file contains something that blocks output.
 Husoski: @manchi most C compilers for x86 have signed chars, so a 0xFF char reads as -1 when converted to int.  That's the same as EOF.  Use feof() to test for end of file
 Husoski: Also, you can use fsetpos() and ftell() to find the length of a file you have opened for binary ('rb') access. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io">https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io</a>
 Husoski: oops make that fseek(), not fsetpos().
 Manchi_o6o7: it constantly prints only four letters
 Manchi_o6o7: I think it is a eof for some reason
 PatrickMcGinnisII: test if the fread is successful instead
 PatrickMcGinnisII: while(fread(&amp;data,1,1,in) {} 
 Manchi_o6o7: data is type of char? same thing
 Manchi_o6o7: only four bytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you cast c to an int, which is correct when testing for an eof
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cast c back to char when printing maybe printf("%c", (char)c);
 tegaroh01: ...
 Manchi_o6o7: it is definitely a probelm with some EOF
 Manchi_o6o7: same thing
 Manchi_o6o7: only first four letters
 PatrickMcGinnisII: check the hex value of the 5th byte in the file you are trying to read...it's probably 0 or FF....extended codes for /0 /r /n, etc. are probably in the file... I'm no help, been 30 years since i fought with fgetc.
 Manchi_o6o7: the problem is fwrite...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: UTF encoded files can have 1 to 4 bytes long
 Manchi_o6o7: it only writes the first four bytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's not the line you commented
 PatrickMcGinnisII: use sizeof(unos)
 jacek: oO
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sizeof(sifra) is always 4 bytes...it's a pointer
 jacek: isnt pointer 8 bytes for 64bit systems
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on compiler
 Manchi_o6o7: it should be strlen....
 Manchi_o6o7: It works finally guys
 Manchi_o6o7: sizeof changed to strlen....
 AntiSquid: i don't understand what you're doing a basic check for EOF should be enough
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh, i need a nap
 JSboss: same
 Puru299792458: anyone doing cp on cf
 Chompien: no
 kresteodymium: me @Puru
 JerWhatIsCode: As a begginer, I'm curios how much I'm learning in the practice puzzles can benefit me in real-life. Same question with CoC.
 solution.cpp: the coding knowledge and problem solving skills will benefit you in any area in the real world
 VizGhar: but you won't need to compute factorial of n-th fibonacci number in real-life coding&#160;;)
 JerWhatIsCode: I understand there's obviously some degree of problem solving training, but all the CoC that focus on converting to ASC and hexadecimal to write strings backwars (or what not). Like, is this concepts actually implemented with a sort of frequency or it's more an arbitrary puzzle?
 solution.cpp: No the puzzles are pretty arbitrary, the concepts such as loops &amp; etc are used
 Uljahn: CoCs are supposed to be solved in under 5 minutes just for fun, there is no much depth in it
 JerWhatIsCode: Cool, thanks for all the inputs
 Uljahn: you can try more mature tasks like multiplayer bot AI games or optimisations
 JerWhatIsCode: I've currently got a dissertation to write so I'm momentarily alright with the simpler games, just was curious how much benefit I might be getting out of them.
 JerWhatIsCode: I figured it was probably mostly problem solving exercises that were arbitrary but wanted to check what others thought
 JSboss: IMO a big benefit of CoC is to branch out your knowledge of other languages through viewing how others complete the same tasks while optimizing different things (speed, shortness, insight)

 struct: grats on 1st place Illedan
 Illedan: 7 days left
 Illedan: But I'm happy :D
 struct: sim is similar to csb right?
 Illedan: yeah
 struct: I might try it then
 struct: NN?
 Illedan: Nah
 struct: ok
 struct: I dont want to ask the search
 struct: Just wanted to know if it was NN
 Illedan: Wouldn't tell anyway :P
 Heldenkrieger01: :smiley:
 PhoenixDB: Bit late to throw my 2 cents into this, but for me one real world benefit of CoC and fibbonachi or factorial style questions is that they are also the sort of questions that will come up in a job interview
 struct: Im sure there are some
 tchar: yeah we all know how non real world job interviews are
 therealbeef: first place in what illedan?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/sofia-labs-coding-challenge</a>
 therealbeef: ah i never saw that one on the webpage
 ZarthaxX: Illedan are you eligible for prize?
 ZarthaxX: hi btw
 OneToothMan: oops lol accidently closed the chatr
 JSboss: hello world
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, Sofia Labs Challenge, story is in California, but not open to U.S. coders, rofl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 player CSB w/ multiple boosts...okay
 therealbeef: yeah, trying a lame port :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no shield, shouldn't be hard
 therealbeef: hadn't even built in shield yet&#160;;-)
 therealbeef: my csb bot is just a lame port of search race
 orangesnowfox: ... my search race is just a lame port of my csb
 therealbeef: that's why i beat you there&#160;;)
 orangesnowfox: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, dunno where referee is ... it prolly has the bumping physics calculations
 PatrickMcGinnisII: probably the same as csb
 orangesnowfox: So... Via the power of chessprogramming wiki, and a longtime friend, my onitama now does depth 7, and this wins me... like, a few extra games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so, boosting your enemy off the best path might be a good idea
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, gtg, glhf...illed
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 struct: Im also not sure if this time the prizes are for europe or only france
 AntiSquid: oh varying number of boosts ... 
 struct: I wonder if this game needed mirror matches
 struct: I havent played to know if the starting position of the pods has any impact
 AntiSquid: oh damn a bit more headache porting my bot than i initially thought
 therealbeef: you mean it's a port&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: no angle&#160;?
 therealbeef: nope
 therealbeef: insta turn
 AntiSquid: does angle not matter&#160;?
 struct: I think you can thrust any direction
 struct: So no angle needed
 AntiSquid: lol hm now i got to think it through a bit @_@
 struct: why?
 AntiSquid: because angles matter in csb
 AntiSquid: now i need to remove stuff related to them
 struct: -3vx ezpz
 AntiSquid: this rare your company thing keep popping up @_@ 
 AntiSquid: what rating should i give&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and it asks for a bio too now? i thought i had one
 struct: rating?
 AntiSquid: add a company to your profile i am sure you'll get a the request on the main page to rate it afterwards
 struct: ah
 struct: Maybe they use this information for cg work
 AntiSquid: or to snitch you out if you say anything wrong&#160;! :O
 AntiSquid:  /j 
 AntiSquid: because i already told them at my work what i wanted to tell them, snitching wouldn't matter 
 struct: When im not happy i usually just tell them
 AntiSquid: ya depends, you can't always say what's on your mind at any company, depends on the people
 struct: Do you know if the prizes are only eligible for French residents? 
 AntiSquid: no, but whatever&#160;? i mean are you competing for prizes?
 struct: no
 struct: I see strong players
 therealbeef: you can say whats on your mind at least once, guaranteed
 struct: pb 4 is there so no chance for us
 AntiSquid: top 3 = be super hardcore tryhard or stay out if you don't play for fun
 AntiSquid: you can always call them and tell them any time if you care therealbeef :D
 struct: time allowed is 100ms
 struct: more than csb :D
 AntiSquid: express your feelings and emotions in a passionate way 
 AntiSquid: is it 100ms for first turn too&#160;?
 struct: I think its 1000
 struct: Havent checked
 AntiSquid: i just wanted to do some random troll submit so not bothering with it anymore
 AntiSquid: wait&#160;! OMG&#160;! Automaton2000 let's submit in D&#160;!!
 Automaton2000: maybe i should look it up
 AntiSquid: yes
 struct: I wonder what is good in this gmae
 struct: game*
 struct: its very strange
 struct: The instant direction changes
 AntiSquid: ya now that i think about it, it might be slightly more complicated than csb 
 AntiSquid: i mean for csb your angle options are limited to -18 to 18
 struct: Well there is no shield
 struct: and only 1 pod
 struct: So I dont think sooo
 AntiSquid: so here you have a larger range to pick from
 struct: so*
 AntiSquid: 360 angles as opposed to 37 
 struct: 37*37
 struct: Still
 struct: I dont think its fair to compare them
 struct: Completely different games
 AntiSquid: no not completely different
 AntiSquid: the similarities are HUGE
 struct: I wonder how csb would be if it had these parameters
 struct: Like no angle restrictions
 struct: and more boosts
 AntiSquid: and lazors
 AntiSquid: oh max speed 100
 DaNinja: wonder is the boost speed still 650?
 therealbeef: i wonder if insta turn with max speed 200 would be more interesting
 AntiSquid: the will of the D 
 AntiSquid: that's enough developing
 AntiSquid: got to save energy for the official contest
 struct: oh
 struct: didnt see the new artwork
 struct: Anyways I guess ill try this mini contest
 struct: Havent been on cg much lately
 therealbeef: antisquid your bots cant keep track of its next checkpoint it seems
 therealbeef: *bot
 AntiSquid: oh well
 AntiSquid: submit a ticket
 therealbeef: blame it on the D?
 AntiSquid: will get my crew to fix it
 struct: will probably just get added to the backlog
 AntiSquid: ok fixt i think
 AntiSquid: was because i just wrote up the entire thing in few seconds to submit some random crap, was aiming for last "nextcheckpoint" in the input :D
 AntiSquid: doesn't change my rank lol .. you made me waste my time
 Astrobytes: struct: can you resubmit Amazons to contribs please?
 struct: done
 Astrobytes: Ah thanks. I've not been around much either
 Astrobytes: Not on chat at least

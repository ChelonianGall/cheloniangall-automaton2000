 Xedux: @KiwiTae  have  you it's solution
 KiwiTae: for each node u need to print its right and bottom neighbours or -1 -1 if they dont exist
 Xedux: yeah i understand
 Xedux: but not able to write the code in proper format
 KiwiTae: can send me your code maybe i can check whats wrong with it hehe
 Xedux: ok
 RohanasaurusRex: hey im relatively new to programming i have learnt python and c, so I was wondering if I should learn Javascript or Java. Which do you think would be more useful. Thanks for the help!
 KiwiTae: go for c# :D
 RohanasaurusRex: Oh ok thanks lol

 Deeps2104: why everyone here is using python or javascript even though c++ beats em all
 eulerscheZahl: beat in regards to what? speed? code size?
 eulerscheZahl: how easy it is to write it?
 eulerscheZahl: use the right tool for the right problem. contests are usually dominated by C++
 Deeps2104: ofc in speed dude
 Deeps2104: Yupp i actually got the idea.For such easy stuff python is way more superior than c++ because of its library

 Corellcb: omg what a madlad
 G-Rom: we just released a new page to highlight streamers (reload your page, it's at the top right). Very excited to see upcoming streams&#160;;) 
 KiwiTae: G-Rom good job, feels dangerous to click this new button hehe
 G-Rom: oh, you mean you're afraid to do immediate live stream by clicking it?
 jrke: new lice button nice
 jrke: live*
 Marchete: noice
 DomiKo: really nice
 KiwiTae: G-Rom yes &gt;&lt;
 KiwiTae: but I did click it :D noice feature
 AntiSquid: G-Rom that's awesome!
 AntiSquid: now other coding puzzle sites will probably do the same :joy:
 AntiSquid: i will try to get a better connection for streams, wonder if people still watch if i go a bit slow though 
 G-Rom: let's try it&#160;;)
 JBM: go go squiddie
 AntiSquid: thibpat has a good stream imo, i mean the way he handles it
 Illedan: Like that new Stream button :O Maybe I should try a stream now :thinking:
 KiwiTae: Illedan u should hehe
 Illedan: No idea what to stream, but I will stream the next contest I think
 JBM: just show us your tits
 JBM: that's what 90% o ftwitch views are about
 Metanoob: mantits
 JBM: quit being so sexist
 Metanoob: sry
 Illedan: I'll think about it
 AntiSquid: would you date a streamer girl JBM?
 JBM: that was unexpected
 AntiSquid: i don't mean a normally dressed one
 JBM: let's say, not any less than any other girl
 JBM: i don't believe in discrimination
 AntiSquid: one of those that just show off their looks and giggle for the thousands of fans
 JBM: where are you going with this?
 AntiSquid: just asking
 AntiSquid: nowhere
 Goldwave: wtf did i just walk in on
 AntiSquid: we don't know what you do at home ... 
 jacek: i know, i work for the gov
 jacek: you nasty boy
 AntiSquid: jacek = NSA spy
 Shrimpster: he didnt say what gov
 AntiSquid: KGB
 KiwiTae: CCP
 Shrimpster: mi6
 Westicles: la Sûreté
 KiwiTae: hey does it get cold in France during winter?&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: Spaz 
 AntiSquid: yes KiwiTae
 KiwiTae: :scream: im gonna miss my island &gt;,&lt;
 AntiSquid: how's china treating you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: western media doesn't cover much
 Westicles: Still having those crazy air raid drills in Taipei?  Almost made me miss my flight once
 KiwiTae: hahah its not crazy we just do that every few months
 AntiSquid: what flight? US army chopper Westicles&#160;? hmmmmm
 KiwiTae: we have military drills, so cannot go out for like 30min its no big deal
 KiwiTae: CCP is bullying everyone in the south sea so theres that &gt;,&lt; as long as they dont invade us we gucci..
 jrke: chinese army is also under india's border
 jacek: oO
 tibu: how to reverse module 5 and -1 to 400000003?
 tibu: *reverse modulus

 KiwiTae: #Clash
 kill-code: oh
 Shrimpster: hello 
 Shrimpster: :D
 kill-code: hi
 Olusola: it's starting in less than 30 secs
 Tanvirt073: wanna play clash of code?
 kill-code: cant
 Tanvirt073: why?
 kill-code: i not good at codeing
 Shrimpster: *sad noises*
 Tanvirt073: so what&#160;? practice makes a man perfest
 Tanvirt073: perfect*
 kill-code: oh
 kill-code: ur right
 Shrimpster: (and a woman lets not be sexist)
 kill-code: #kiilcoodeown
 croraf: What is clash of code?
 kill-code: idk
 kill-code: join my chat
 Shrimpster: a little competition to show and improve your coding skills 
 Tanvirt073: yup sure
 croraf: ok im in
 croraf: it starts in 1min
 pharesmostafa: hi all
 Remembered_Goodbye: hey guys, howd u do the mime type puzzle
 _Lion_: hi
 LeisureSkrellingtons: is there a way to turn off the 'special modes' in clash? like reverse etc.
 Einwickler: LeisureSkrellingtons no there isn't
 Remembered_Goodbye: no i think its just random
 LeisureSkrellingtons: ok, thanks
 kill-code: hi
 Remembered_Goodbye: np
 Ethaen: caca
 AntiSquid: don't .
 ismail_enegadi: dd
 kill-code: hi
 eulerscheZahl: when was that LIVE box added to the top bar?
 Astrobytes: today
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't understand what the streamer is saying
 Astrobytes: I've not checked the streamer
 eulerscheZahl: CoC and loud music
 Astrobytes: lol, how entertaining
 kill-code: wyd
 eulerscheZahl: how does that even work? does CG regularly poll twitch to see if there are streams?
 G-Rom: yep
 codeing: wesh
 codeing: does it exist another platform fun like codingame&#160;?
 kill-code: ys
 kill-code: a
 codeing: kill-code what&#160;?
 kill-code: what
 kill-code: why are you mean :sob:
 Shrimpster: there is codechef or smthin like that
 VampiresKing: i dont think so their is other fun platform    codiningame.this;    . lol
 Shrimpster: but I prefer cg  too^^
 eulerscheZahl: for classic textbased puzzles there are tons of other websites
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank, codeforces, codechef, spoj, ...
 VampiresKing: but this one is interactive
 Astrobytes: project euler
 eulerscheZahl: the interactive part of CodinGame however is pretty unique
 VampiresKing: agreed
 Westicles: Let's get dbdr a carton of cigarettes and he can stream 2048 info
 Astrobytes: yes, CG has the graphical aspect, multiplayers etc. Far more features than other sites
 VampiresKing: yeah
 dbdr: Westicles, I don't smoke
 eulerscheZahl: good decision
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 kill-code: smoke
 Westicles: Okay, well this current guy is the only twitch I've watched.  Dancing girls then?
 darkhorse64: Coding girls only 
 eulerscheZahl: is KnittingDev still a thing?
 kill-code: i am a girl
 Astrobytes: hm, I just tuned in and he was googling 'square'
 darkhorse64: Then you can stream
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/7b72e76d98eb62b7aa39a0c0c4d73c48265604">https://www.codingame.com/profile/7b72e76d98eb62b7aa39a0c0c4d73c48265604</a>she was streaming regularly when i was new to CG
 Shrimpster: ahahaha
 kill-code: maybe\
 Westicles: dbdr, I was reading the ru chat.  They all call you the 'monster'
 kill-code: im dieing
 dbdr: honored :D
 Astrobytes: gotta add that to your bio now dbdr, 'a.k.a The Monster'&#160;:)
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: you know russian Westicles?
 darkhorse64: In Cyrillic
 Astrobytes: haha yes
 Westicles: no, just read the translation.  
 dbdr: dbdr он же Монстр
 dbdr: looking for clues?
 Astrobytes: It even looks good!
 Westicles: Yeah, but it turns out we are doing the same thing.  Considering we pretty much have exact same scores now
 AntiSquid: there's a streamer, let's RAID
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 kill-code: i am streaming
 eulerscheZahl: your lead is surprisingly persistent. without you i would say the maximum possible is somewhere around 59353k
 dbdr: I didn't know that was the maximum
 dbdr: that's how I beat it
 eulerscheZahl: like the bumblebee who doesn't know that it can't fly
 AntiSquid: game&#160;?
 dbdr: 2048
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile royale is climbing ranks at onitama. he keeps playing although the last few CP are quite hard to get compared to the effort needed. I think he likes the game&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: oh you're 2nd now
 dbdr: oh, gg on lvl 54 btw
 eulerscheZahl: for a few days again
 eulerscheZahl: lvl54 since yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: minesweeper got approved
 Astrobytes: ah that's why all the new contributions from you :P
 AntiSquid: go faster! it's fast mode&#160;! faster&#160;! damn it lol
 eulerscheZahl: if i was going for XP, i would create clashes
 Astrobytes: hm, fair point
 Monstrux: hey Guys, quick question
 AntiSquid: for clash how would you know the puzzle you want to make doesn't exist#
 eulerscheZahl: you join and solve 1 problem
 eulerscheZahl: then you can join again to solve the next
 dbdr: now there are two puzzles both called Minesweeper :D
 eulerscheZahl: and if you do that too often you have to solve a captcha
 eulerscheZahl: i know dbdr. I just didn't care :D
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64, dbdr: off-topic but what's the meta on Penguins? Just the usual minimax/MCTS-fest or anything special going on?
 eulerscheZahl: there are almost 2 2048 as well
 AntiSquid: and multiple bulls and caws
 dbdr: Astrobytes: no Idea, I just have greedy I think
 dbdr: depth 1
 AntiSquid: nvm
 darkhorse64: greedy, don't get pushed
 Astrobytes: cool, thanks
 dbdr: bulls and calves
 darkhorse64: I could write a MCTS for two players but I don't know how handle 3,4 players. MaxN does not look too appealing
 AntiSquid: @Coderbekka check BotG lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah I was considering options and nothing looked overly appealing, or at least not worth the effort in terms of reward
 darkhorse64: Waiting for GoTW magic to add 200 players
 Astrobytes: lol yeah, hopefully

 dbdr: let's see how CG deals with this link :D
 Hjax: almost exactly three weeks until the fall contest :D 
 AntiSquid: wtf ^
 AntiSquid: guy above hjax
 Hjax: i sniped squids wtf
 kill-code: lol
 Astrobytes: it's the original 'monster' quote from ru AntiSquid
 dbdr: I'm a monster cg apparently. maybe means cg monster?
 JBM: maybe it means you're scary to them
 dbdr: I'm the monster under your bed when you switch off the lights at night
 AntiSquid: but i sleep under the bed ...
 AntiSquid: alone
 AntiSquid: where's the monster
 Hjax: dbdr is a giant, city destroying crab (rustacean)
 Astrobytes: 'rustacean' :smile:
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Crab_Monsters">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Crab_Monsters</a>
 Hjax: thats what the rust community calls themselves 
 Hjax: rustaceans :D
 Astrobytes: brilliant, I love it
 Hjax: the mascot for rust is a crab called Ferris
 Astrobytes: Like 'ferrous'?
 Astrobytes: (iron, rust etc)
 dbdr: probably, good catch!
 Hjax: yep!
 Astrobytes: Nice!
 dbdr: original c2rust tool was call corrode
 zapakh: That is awesome
 Astrobytes: It wouldn't be right if there weren't multiple puns on the language name within a language community/toolchain
 kill-code: #kiilcoodeown
 Hjax:&#160;?
 dbdr: I guess 'cargo' is also in the industrial theme as a package manager and build tool
 kill-code: it a chaat 
 kill-code: u can spam anything you want
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 will find you and ban you
 Automaton2000: then again, i don't have any idea of how to code
 Astrobytes: cargo, crates, container/ship, rust. Works for me :P
 kill-code: T-T
 kill-code: yall are mean

 Astrobytes: lol
 Jetim: Just found this website, it loooks great!
 AntiSquid: squal&#160;? eulerscheZahl
 Hjax: squat? 
 dbdr: deploy the squid!
 Shadowtick: I made a translator its called the translator of randomness
 Astrobytes: squab
 Shadowtick: does anyone wanna see it?
 Astrobytes: No.
 Hjax: oh thats a good one astro
 AntiSquid: no Shadowtick
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Shadowtick:&#160;;-; it took me forever
 Hjax: the art for the fall challenge looks pretty cool
 eulerscheZahl: and it's even 4k
 AntiSquid: lots of dishes with the bird's head on display, how can someone eat like that

 AntiSquid: (squab)
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: isn't your mineseeper much harder than VilBoub's?
 eulerscheZahl: i think easier
 dbdr: his solver only does local reasoning
 eulerscheZahl: you can guess and get lucky
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes you have to
 dbdr: so probably his problems are very easy
 eulerscheZahl: vilboub requires a full solving at once
 Hjax: now as long as they dont have insanely limited information to the point of randomless 
 dbdr: did you look at his code?
 eulerscheZahl: taking into account the total number of mines
 dbdr: 50 lines, only trivial reasoning
 eulerscheZahl: no but solved his puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: oh, mine is longer than his
 dbdr: maybe you overdid it. or I am missing something
 eulerscheZahl: blatant copy-paste then :D
 dbdr:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i stole his puzzle
 dbdr: no, yours is harder
 dbdr: and nicer looking of course&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: but the desktop items ...
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even think it's harder. if you fail at some reasoning, you can reveal more numbers first and get extra clues
 eulerscheZahl: btw check out for todays newsletter, you may see some minesweeper
 dbdr: I have the same logic and make a guess in yours, but almost always die
 AntiSquid: newsletter?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they'll announce the twitch streaming indicator
 eulerscheZahl: not sent yet
 Hjax: hmm the file name for the contest art is "codin_zelda_witches_fr"
 eulerscheZahl: but can you find the _en version
 eulerscheZahl: i failed to translate it, don't understand the art&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Zelda Witches from France
 LegendaryStone: is the live section new
 LegendaryStone: or im blind
 Hjax: yes
 jrke: what type of bot programming it should be state machine or minimax? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: yes, blind, was there for years now, ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah, i use it as a win for p1
 AntiSquid: see&#160;? LegendaryStone
 eulerscheZahl: that LIVE was added today
 eulerscheZahl: seems to sort by the number of viewers
 Shadowtick: ...ummmmmmmmmmmmm
 AntiSquid: no ^
 Shadowtick: I am just gonna ignore this chat so I don't get confused
 Shadowtick: so yeah imma just go
 AntiSquid: :hamburger:
 Shadowtick: :radioactive::hamburger:
 Shadowtick: radioactive hamburger
 Rovetown: xd
 Shadowtick: I was thinking to put just a biohazard and hamburger after it but I thought you know radioactive hamburger is smarter  
 Rovetown: lol
 AntiSquid: the second coding stream looks weird
 Rovetown: so im kinda new to python, and im doing the fantastic bit puzzle. what im trying to do is get the entityId of the Snaffles and let my wizards move to the x and y of these balls
 Rovetown: but idk how im able to get the entitieid of the balls
 Rovetown: and then access their x and y coords
 Rovetown: could anyone lend me a helping hand?
 AntiSquid: see statement
 AntiSquid: check entity type
 AntiSquid: or something
 Rovetown: ok ima try that

 Astrobytes: lol wat
 Astrobytes: how did that happen?
 dbdr: I always found it strange the level is in the url
 dbdr: since the level can change
 dbdr: so I guessed they just ignore that part
 Astrobytes: guessed correctly!

 AntiSquid: o _ o
 Shadowtick: I can speak the furry language now :3
 Astrobytes: Shadowtick, give it a rest will you
 Shadowtick: which is actually funny because it is just taking r's and making it w's like for = fow
 Rovetown: hell yeah i threw away the python idea, went to java again with a new idea, and bam! my wizards now go to a rdm snaffle
 Rovetown: now i only need to check for the state and then make them score
 Shadowtick: and how about you leave me alone Astrobytes
 Hjax: you are walking on some thin ice there buddy 
 Hjax: astro is a chat moderator 
 MSmits: what did I just walk into?
 Hjax: nothing important 
 MSmits: kk
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits, well played :P
 MSmits: hehe someone got it at least
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Hjax: i still dont get it 
 <b>**Hjax sips more coffee</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: check shadow ticks messages from the last days and you'll see
 Shadowtick: welp imma go away for a bit
 Shadowtick: because I need to get some school stuff done
 Hjax: i havent seen re curse in a while, has he said if hes going to play the contest? 
 Shadowtick: so have a great day everyone
 Astrobytes: bye Shadowtick, same to you
 Astrobytes: I doubt it Hjax
 Astrobytes: Don't think he's feeling it much recently
 dbdr: he might lurk as other times
 Astrobytes: yeah possibly
 Hjax: i keep crossing my fingers teccles will randomly pop up and play as well, but thats looking less and less likely 
 MSmits: too much pressure I think, he usually wins or almost wins but it does still take him a lot of time like the rest of us. It's not acceptable for him to perform less because he has less time to invest. and he doesnt like recent games I believe
 Astrobytes: yeah I guess when teccles said he was done he really meant it
 Astrobytes: and yeah MSmits. Plus time invested vs reward 
 MSmits: personally I accepted that when I invest time like a normal person I will end between 10 and 40 and that's ok
 MSmits: my first few contests were really obsessive for me
 Hjax: i have enough PTO to take the whole week off, but im not sure thats worth it 
 Astrobytes: that's why teccles stopped, too much time for not a lot of reward
 MSmits: I will be very busy during that time, but i'll invest what little free time i have
 Hjax: smits post mortem is going to be like, i only had 20 minutes to write my bot, so i was pleased that i finished in top 30 legend 
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: not wrong :D
 MSmits: thats overstating it lol, at least 20 hrs  :P
 MSmits: I used to invest like 60 hrs in a contest though 
 MSmits: first contest i slept for 16 hrs straight when it was done
 MSmits: and i was not recovered when i woke up
 jacek: so traumatizing
 jacek: HAPPY CAPS LOCK DAY
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: lol, ceg stays up for the last couple of days of contests, all-nighters
 MSmits: it's probably the best time period during the contest to do that
 MSmits: by that time I'm usually out of ideas or too tired to recode things
 Hjax: at least in UTG i spent the last day watching replays and shouting HOW DOES THIS WORK 
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: hey jacek,  I had this bonus for oware EPT for whomever's turn it is and it was pretty big. When I fitted it for jacekmax, i got the best result for 0 for some reason
 Hjax: i got a good idea with a few hours left
 Astrobytes: that was a frantic last day
 jacek: for 0?
 Hjax: and then i skipped OOC and ran out of motivation on friday in pacman
 Hjax: i really hope the fall game is nothing like pacamn
 Astrobytes: I didn't even bother trying to go further than bronze in pacman, was totally unmotivated
 MSmits: imean of 0
 MSmits: meaning it's deactivated
 Hjax: i never worked out why my bot was bad, i think me and smits were doing roughly the same thing 
 MSmits: 56% with it at 0, 40-48% for higher values
 Hjax: could have just been not enough sims because i was using java
 MSmits: tried negative too... was worse again
 MSmits: Hjax yeah we did the same thing
 MSmits: just more performance, i went a little deeper because of that, or at least it converged well for higher depths
 Hjax: either way that game was incredibly frustrating 
 Hjax: it was very difficult to watch a replay and know why you lost 
 dbdr: MSmits: which is better: +0 or -0?&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol... i just tried 0 :P
 dbdr: there is no 0, just +0 and -0 in floats
 MSmits: Hjax yeah, also most things didnt seem to work even though you felt like it should
 MSmits: i have floats
 MSmits: wait no they're ints
 Astrobytes: they're all floats down here...
 MSmits: :grin:
 Hjax: youll float too? 
 dbdr: get out of this body, JS
 AntiSquid: postmortems for pacman pointed a lot of interesting things one could have done
 Hjax: ill just never touch it again and hope the next contest is better :D 
 Hjax: it cant possibly be worse....... right? :P
 inoryy: I kind of liked it&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: weirdooo :P
 Hjax: hi inoryy :D 
 jacek: "If Pac-Man had affected us as kids, we'd all be running around in dark rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive electronic music"
 inoryy: hello&#160;:)

 351062: Is it possible to reach 50M+ with just the snake eval on 2048&#160;? Can't figure out if my bottleneck is my exploration or my eval
 RohanasaurusRex: Hey im relatively new and have learned python and c. Which do you think would be more useful to learn next, Java or Javascript? Thanks
 Shadowtick: pffffffff wait why did you say darling to me????? AntiSquid
 Hjax: java and javascript are different tools for different jobs 
 wlesavo: inoryy yeah they probably wanted to end on monday, for 2 weekends to be included
 RohanasaurusRex: ok thanks
 wlesavo: Neumann for sure possible
 Neumann: ffs
 Neumann: I don't understand
 wlesavo: but keep in mind that some snakes better than the others
 AntiSquid: is it a trigger Shadowtick&#160;?
 AntiSquid: don't read too much into it
 Shadowtick: no I am confused why you said it to me AntiSquid
 wlesavo: my best perfoming snake was horizontal bottom right headed i believe
 inoryy: wlesavo but that's already how it worked for the last 2 years, start on Fri and end on Mon following 2 weekends
 AntiSquid: i could say it to anyone, you're not special, don't get any ideas
 Shadowtick: I just feel like I got called a child when I am 16 that's all AntiSquid
 inoryy:&#160;:) 
 wlesavo: inoryy oh i see, then difference not that important anyway
 AntiSquid: ok sweety
 jacek: oO
 inoryy: just seems like a random change if it's really starting on Thu

 Shadowtick: Stop it AntiSquid I don't want to feel like I am being called a child!
 Neumann: wlesavo: hu. How would that make a difference&#160;?

 AntiSquid: hold Automaton2000's hand
 Automaton2000: but i need a way to see which one of them
 icecream17: i don't think anyone will give you the answer but if you are stuck on something specific you can ask
 AntiSquid: you basically need to lure them to the same spot and then thunder them 
 AntiSquid: this is all i can remember
 HotDogWater: I've passed all testcases but am failing a validator.  Is there a way to get info on the validator to see what code tweaks are required?
 AntiSquid: i guessing it's the last validator which is like the last testcase
 Smish314: Weirdly, it's validator 6 of 9 in "A Child's Play"
 Smish314: Though I pass test 6 with ye olde flying colors.
 Skynse: yo wtf, why are there so many teletubbies in this clashofcode match
 Skynse: probably bots
 Skynse: lol
 Y0ursTruly: xD
 TheEvilSkull_cad6: How do i report a bug on a puzzle?
 RohanasaurusRex: once you submit you can give feedback on the right
 RohanasaurusRex: im pretty new here though so there might be a better way
 Y0ursTruly: that redirector was really fun
 Y0ursTruly: came second tho owo
 LastRick: What puzzle has a bug?
 Mingus: guys  who code wth python wdu use as a frameworks plz 
 Mingus: cerryOy?
 Mingus: cherryPy*?
 icecream17: i just add frameworks whenever i have a problem i can solve with it
 Mingus: or django 
 Skynse: depends on the task at hand
 RohanasaurusRex: im pretty new to this website and it seems nice do you guys happen to know any websites similar to these where you can solve puzzles and compete? Thanks
 Skynse: I don't know of any other websites where you can compete in real time, but for problem solving, I'd recommend codewars.com, or leetcode
 Y0ursTruly: hmm that find circles in the numbers, made u read the question twice
 BkDevDude: @RohanasarusRex Try Codewars, I'm not sure if you can compete but it's pretty similar.
 BkDevDude: How do I determine the numbers that have the lowest difference? For example if the input is "1,7,4,8" It would choose 4 and 8.
 Y0ursTruly: try running abs between the numbers
 Y0ursTruly: Math.abs
 Y0ursTruly: if u do js
 Laminator: would 7,4 have a lower differest?
 BkDevDude: Well true, but it's only doing smaller, bigger. Not bigger, smaller.
 BkDevDude: And I do Python
 Y0ursTruly: well doesnt python have those versatile variables and stuff :l
 BkDevDude: Idk I guess so&#160;:/
 BkDevDude: Is there a way to generate words using letters? If the input is 'ethal' it would make 'lethal' or something.
 zapakh: [c+'ethal' for c in map(chr,range(97,123))]
 KiwiTae: BkDevDude no shade but lowest dif with this set 1,7,4,8  would be abs(8-7) right?
 Metanoob: ye however it would be possible if you have to treat it as a sequence
 Metanoob: (i.e. 7, 4 and/or 4, 8)
 Metanoob: 4,8 ) *
 KiwiTae: looks like the horse racing duals puzzle~ 
 KiwiTae: need to sort the array hehe
 Creetch: So i sorted the vector for the horse-racing and it passes the 3 test cases, but fails on 2 of the extended challenges for who know what reason. 
 Creetch: Now its failing on more after making 0 changes. FML, FTP
 icecream17: yes yes! (not very interesting just celebrating) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/494793799">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/494793799</a>
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 Creetch: wow, needed to set my different to INT_MAX....
 KiwiTae: Creetchgj
 victoraavila: hello there
 KILLINA13: how do you create private clashes?
 NotSpice: Any chance someone here has done the credit card verifier easy puzzle? Sorry if this isn't the place to ask.
 KiwiTae: u got the puzzle link?
 NotSpice: This is the link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/credit-card-verifier-luhns-algorithm">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/credit-card-verifier-luhns-algorithm</a>

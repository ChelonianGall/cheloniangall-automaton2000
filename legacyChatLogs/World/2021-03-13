 Imsure1200q:&#160;:) first tried a puzzle lol
 SilverEagle: LoL
 Imsure1200q: my code complaining about literally the same value
 Imsure1200q: imagine if i did x=r() and then for i from 0 upto x 
 Imsure1200q: where r() yields the same result every time
 Imsure1200q: and so i replace the entire thing with `for i from 0 upto r()`
 Imsure1200q: and  suddenly its complaining about some completely different line like ha how did it get there?
 Imsure1200q: huh???
 Imsure1200q: game literally didn't output a direction
 Imsure1200q: *input
 Imsure1200q: yo i think this stuff needs fixing
 Imsure1200q: broo
 Imsure1200q: guys how do you report a bug
 Imsure1200q: for a puzzle
 ZarthaxX: prob you have a bug
 Imsure1200q: cuz it just aint inputting one of the most necessary params
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Imsure1200q: look ok ill send you my code
 ZarthaxX: no plz
 ZarthaxX: what puzzle
 Imsure1200q: 'Don't Panic'
 Imsure1200q: well i am panicking so
 ZarthaxX: you prob have a bug then
 Imsure1200q: i dont understand cuz it says for every game turn
 ZarthaxX: check if you read more lines than you should
 ZarthaxX: so?
 Imsure1200q: Line 1: 2 integers cloneFloor clonePos and one string direction. cloneFloor and clonePos are the coordinates of the leading unblocked clone. direction indicates the current direction of the leading clone: 
 ZarthaxX: so?
 Imsure1200q: its literally only 1 line so i start to read that line
 Imsure1200q: and
 Imsure1200q: for some problems it does have all 3 params 
 Imsure1200q: *test cases
 Imsure1200q: and for test case 4 it doesnt have all 3
 ZarthaxX: you should try resetting your code and printing input
 ZarthaxX: just to verify
 ZarthaxX: but again, prob your bug
 Imsure1200q: oh so thats how it ties with the for loop thing
 Imsure1200q: i dont understand it though like its literally the same for loop as before i just rearranged the values
 Imsure1200q: i've literally console.errored every value its the same
 ZarthaxX: mm
 ZarthaxX: i dont get what you just said lol
 Imsure1200q: so lets say you have like a variable x = "24"
 Imsure1200q: so thats a string
 Imsure1200q: and you want to have a for loop starting from 0 and ending from that number in the string
 Imsure1200q: *ending to
 Imsure1200q: either you can doy = x converted to an integerfor ( var i = 0; i &lt; y; i++)
 Imsure1200q: or you can do for ( var i = 0; i &lt; x converted to an integer; i++)
 Imsure1200q: due to substitution
 Imsure1200q: for some reason though my for loop is treating it as if it werent the same thing
 Imsure1200q: i kinda dont like that lol
 Imsure1200q: i've even checked the type of the variable it said 'number' not 'string'
 Imsure1200q: how in the world could it possibly think 1 &gt;= 3
 Imsure1200q: no way i've even checked if i+1 &lt; 3 in the current iteration it said true like why do i need to put a redundant 3 characters in there
 Imsure1200q: welp
 ZarthaxX: im confused by your massive wall of text tbh :P
 Imsure1200q: yeah like half of that are my train of thought
 Imsure1200q: idk i fiddled with smth and it fixed it idk oh well whatever fixed now
 Imsure1200q: "i have reached a limit of plays per period of time"
 Imsure1200q: what
 Imsure1200q: like do i need to buy some premium membership or something to unlock 50 more plays or somthing
 ZarthaxX: no lol just stop spammingh submit
 Imsure1200q: wasnt even spamming&#160;:(
 Imsure1200q: oh cool
 Imsure1200q: apparently javascript kinda has same string comparison with c++
 Imsure1200q: so 'a'&gt;'b'  -&gt; false
 Imsure1200q: and 'b'&gt;'a' -&gt; true
 Imsure1200q: everytime i close this chat bar and i see like 1000 my profile pictures on the right &gt;:)
 shashankm: hello
 Imsure1200q: hi
 shashankm: how should i start c++
 shashankm: i m a beginner
 Imsure1200q: what i did was watch youtube and do a free course
 Imsure1200q: for example w3schools.com
 Imsure1200q: tho thats not exactly what i used but it works
 Imsure1200q: will kinda give you the basics of c++ but it might still be confusing so youtube kinda fixes that
 Imsure1200q: for example i watch javidx9, his video helped me actually understand pointers and references and stuff
 Imsure1200q: however :exclamation:
 Imsure1200q: i am not expert'
 Imsure1200q: but thats just what worked for me personally but if you wanna try the same way thats up to you
 iThinkyouk: Do any of you find that the chat text input stealing the focus during a clash is kinda annoying? How do I disable it?
 Imsure1200q: if its your first programming language you should also probably get used to some stuff
 Imsure1200q: there is settings button
 Imsure1200q: under chat box
 Imsure1200q: click that
 Imsure1200q: is the home page being blank because of my duckduckgo addon or its actually just blank
 Imsure1200q: ok thats interesting lol
 creeperZnation4: Personally, I don't mind the chat... If I find it disturbing, I just collapse it and forget about it
 GoldenEra: i think u should learn c before cpp 
 baguettes: opposite works fine too

 jacek: yhm
 hooshemadhoosh: hey. I got error on running my cpp code. but CG doesn't show the input of test case that I stuck on it. it just says "expected sth and found sth else" is there any way to solve this problem?
 hooshemadhoosh: is there anyone can help me?
 jacek: so you printed wrong answer
 hooshemadhoosh: :weary:
 hooshemadhoosh: are you talking with me jacek?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: what puzzle
 hooshemadhoosh: any
 hooshemadhoosh: any puzzle
 hooshemadhoosh: how can I check the input of TESTCASES?
 jacek: click on the rectangles right to test cases

 Dan4Life: just wanted to say it for no reason whatsoever
 heloche: hi
 heloche: we're two then
 Rypakka: HEy
 Rypakka: makes us three
 AntiSquid: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i think there was a bug in your code
 heloche: say what
 heloche: omg&#160;!
 heloche: lack of challengers today
 heloche: :rage:
 AntiSquid: wdym? thousands are there waiting in the multiplayer section
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a> heloche
 heloche: I mean still waiting too long
 heloche: do we earn xp point when "winning" the challenge?
 jacek: oh, where are my manners
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Rypakka: How do I return to the clash?
 Rypakka: I suddenly got kicked back to the lobby and cant reconnect
 Rypakka: After I submitted
 Rypakka: I can't even see the results
 jacek: dunno. the best i know is to wait for clash over and youll get notification
 Rypakka: Ohh&#160;:/ 
 jacek: no browser history?
 Rypakka: I keep getting error 505
 Rypakka: which prevents me from seeing each results of my previous clashes
 jacek: oO
 ez9: how can I make a gui with c++?
 codybumba: You can use MFC or Qt.
 MadKnight: ez9 use any GUI library
 Norxen: SDL2 its good too
 baguettes: Sad gtk noises
 Selim2004: im new
 Ordonnateur: isn't the tutorial boss of the week puzzle too good for a tutorial area&#160;? it don't do a  lot of mistake xd.
 heloche: howdie 
 ROBO_17: howdie howdie how
 ROBO_17: haha
 jacek: tutorial boos for puzzle of the week?
 eulerscheZahl: tryangle catch
 jacek: its tutorial?
 eulerscheZahl: it's hard to nerf your bot when you have one ready&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the introduction league
 eulerscheZahl: wood4
 jacek: oh
 Ordonnateur: wooden 4 ligue are supposed as tutorial no ,
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, I take the blame for the strong boss on me
 Disembleergon: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time...
 jacek: use less time for boss [solved]
 Ordonnateur: (he even manage next zone to capture dist ç_ç, so many thing to implement just to go out of the tutorial xd)
 jacek: Disembleergon it could also mean your program crashed
 Disembleergon: yeah Im new to pthon and write if(...) return ...
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is weak in a way that it finds a close trianglebut starts with 3 random units
 Disembleergon: I fixed it ^^
 jacek: also, where are those original tags?
 AntiSquid: wood league is trial by fire
 AntiSquid: the worst is yet to come
 eulerscheZahl: i completely lost motivation when I got the news that it won't be a contest
 Turtho: hello, i can't figure out how to keep a variable after a loop occurs, whenever it does 1 turn of loop my variables are wiped,
 Turtho: any help&#160;?
 jacek: Turtho what language
 AntiSquid: euler do they give a reason when they reject it?
 Turtho: java
 jacek: declare the variables before the loop
 eulerscheZahl: declare the variable outside of the loop
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Turtho: ok thanks
 jacek: slowzahl
 AntiSquid: declare the variable outside the loop Turtho
 eulerscheZahl: would have been fast enough to beat Astrobytes
 jacek: e.g. after the loop
 Turtho: makes sense now ty
 AntiSquid: no problem
 AntiSquid: glad to help
 QueenRi: :nerd:
 jacek: hmm kovi is leading in tryangle catch by much
 eulerscheZahl: and jacek has a C# bot that does the same useless drawings as the boss :smug:
 eulerscheZahl: :smirk:
 baguettes: smirk smirk
 QueenRi: :rolling_eyes:
 jacek: i copy pasted it from contribution
 jacek: or maybe i taught NN to approximate your boss. who knows
 Scarfield: a wild frog has appeared&#160;:) you have been missed by many
 eulerscheZahl: but not forgotten. Automaton prevented that
 Scarfield: xD
 jacek: AutomatonNN really?
 AutomatonNN: but it's not hard to tell if they make it better
 QueenRi: :astonished:
 Scarfield: its a little sad that Astrobytes havent seen your burn, im sure he would appreciate it 
 jacek: also, happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: i can show him my die instead
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/10kiz5x">https://prnt.sc/10kiz5x</a>these rotations are hurting my head
 eulerscheZahl: not actually "my" die, i just downloaded it
 QueenRi: :rage:

 eulerscheZahl: not bad grammar for "my death" :P

 AntiSquid: monopoly has cards
 QueenRi: Yeah
 AntiSquid: why Ri and not Reeeee&#160;?
 QueenRi: Seriously
 QueenRi: :rolling_eyes:

 AntiSquid: cut few ees
 QueenRi: Nah
 QueenRi: Too much work
 AntiSquid: the length is for dramatic effect

 AntiSquid: :rolling_stones:
 AntiSquid: what are you up to anyway QueenRi&#160;?
 QueenRi: Oh i am coding
 AntiSquid: what exactly
 QueenRi: A GAME
 QueenRi: DUH
 AntiSquid: could be anything else
 AntiSquid: what game
 QueenRi: Like car race
 AntiSquid: ah on codingame&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: or you mean you write your bot for it&#160;?
 QueenRi: Nah
 QueenRi: On something else
 QueenRi: Uh...
 QueenRi: Phython

 QueenRi: Uh...
 QueenRi: Just saw
 QueenRi: it
 AntiSquid: much wow
 QueenRi: :rolling_eyes:
 jacek: oh my
 kovi: ouch, cg runs on 2 type of (aws) instances nowadays?
 eulerscheZahl: they took down the 3rd instance?
 kovi: oh there are more?i just noticed 20% speed difference (and unfortunately I'm still that 20% slower than top in clobber)
 eulerscheZahl: CG has different machine types. others did more investigation, I never really cared
 AntiSquid: is 3rd instance related to this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://channeldailynews.com/news/fire-burns-down-ovhclouds-data-centre-in-strasbourg/73440">https://channeldailynews.com/news/fire-burns-down-ovhclouds-data-centre-in-strasbourg/73440</a>

 eulerscheZahl: they even rejudged all submits when they switched hardware
 AntiSquid: all the submit spam for nothing&#160;:'(
 kovi: for which game?
 kovi: oh i c
 eulerscheZahl: my code vs zombies was downgraded significantly, i might have spammed there :innocent:

 eulerscheZahl: who would ever use this chat for self-advertising?also check out my current project <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/875803b885205380cd623ba3bc4504553a26fa">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/875803b885205380cd623ba3bc4504553a26fa</a>
 MSmits: are you combining your two favorite addicitons&#160;?
 MSmits: addictions that is
 eulerscheZahl: coding and gambling?
 MSmits: was thinking alcohol and gamblng but sure :P
 MSmits: make it 3
 eulerscheZahl: btw saw your remarks about bender. you are totally overthinking it
 MSmits: how so
 eulerscheZahl: it was never supposed to be hard to get 100%&#160;:(
 MSmits: i like that it's hard
 eulerscheZahl: shall i spoiler it?
 MSmits: fine with me, but do it in pm then
 MSmits: just in case
 jrke: my first codingame anniversary is on 18th march :heart_eyes: just discovered
 eulerscheZahl: i always missed mine
 eulerscheZahl: wait, really?you aren't around for longer than a year?
 darkhorse64: Still not guru after one year&#160;? Lazy guy ...
 jrke: not lazy also have to study
 jrke: nope not longer than year
 jrke: check my profile first rank update is on 19th march in graph
 darkhorse64: Just kidding
 yoyobro123: hi
 yoyobro123: ok
 ZarthaxX: i never got guru either hehe :rofl:
 yoyokid: Hi Ok
 jrke: i am like 6-7k CPs behind the guru tag at the moment 
 ZarthaxX: you are 13yo wtf
 AntiSquid: huh&#160;? what's the secret spoiler sauce for bender 4&#160;? 
 jrke: oh mistake now 14 yo lemme update
 MSmits: it's not secret, euler just told me his approach to solving it, nothing crazy. Kind of how we talked about it the other day
 eulerscheZahl: read darkhorse's post on the forum, gives a good summary
 AntiSquid: so what do you expect ZarthaxX&#160;? that he plays with barbies?
 AntiSquid: no dirty shortcut&#160;?
 AntiSquid: to solving&#160;?
 MSmits: not really
 MSmits: I am just overthinking my initial solution by looking too far ahead as usual
 MSmits: but I like it that way
 AntiSquid: which darkhorse post&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-bender-episode-4/84756">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-bender-episode-4/84756</a>

 AntiSquid: darkhorse64
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 darkhorse64: I have no alt. It's forbidden
 AntiSquid: so derjack is an illegitimate child?
 darkhorse64: Not from me
 MSmits: if derjack had an evil twin it might be called darkhorse
 darkhorse64: I solved aCat Cooperative Mate with Rook chess puzzle. If only all puzzles were of this quality
 MSmits: it is rook mate algorithm?
 AntiSquid: what quality?describe taste
 MSmits: rook + king vs king?
 darkhorse64: cooperative root mate. Quality = nice graphics, known algorithm with a twist
 MSmits: ah nice
 darkhorse64: Both cooperate for the shortest mate
 darkhorse64: I think he intend to have a non cooperative version to be solved with a minimax
 darkhorse64: intends
 MSmits: yay, i reunited bender and fry in the first testcase :P
 MSmits: it's funny that the solution is in the name of the testcase.  I meant I have a working bfs though :P Just for movement
 darkhorse64: Your weekend project&#160;? 
 MSmits: it's gonna be a bit longer probably
 MSmits: have to start writing my thesis tomorrow
 MSmits: i mean for studies, not writing a thesis on bender
 darkhorse64: Time to try to steal your C4 lead now you are defenceless
 ZarthaxX: thesis for comp sci&#160;?
 MSmits: kind of ZarthaxX. It's basically about improving my teaching material for 3 classes about optimization
 MSmits: to teach my students greedy solutions and hill climbing
 ZarthaxX: what?
 ZarthaxX: thesis for a teaching career?
 MSmits: well not sure if thesis is the right word?
 MSmits: the class is educational design &amp; research
 ZarthaxX: you gotta design a "programme" for ypur class?
 MSmits: i have to use literature and all that
 MSmits: teaching material
 MSmits: and lesson plans
 ZarthaxX: that's what u call thesis?
 MSmits: i dont know what its called
 ZarthaxX: not thesis
 MSmits: I am translating from my own language
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: really cool tho
 MSmits: yeah i just dont like writing stuff to tie literature together
 MSmits: it's boring
 ZarthaxX: hate literature
 MSmits: well i like it when i am finding new algorithms in it to win at boardgames :p
 ZarthaxX: did you? lol
 MSmits: for D&amp;B it worked ok
 ZarthaxX: ah u meant papers
 ZarthaxX: reading papers
 MSmits: yeah thats called literature here
 ZarthaxX: yeah sure
 MSmits: I have to read papers for this thing
 ZarthaxX: oh noes
 MSmits: and reference them
 ZarthaxX: looks like a thesis now lol
 MSmits: thats what i meant, it kinda is
 MSmits: but it's centered on designing classes and teaching material
 MSmits: thats also a science
 MSmits: didactic science?
 MSmits: not sure what its called in English
 eulerscheZahl: we got the idea
 MSmits: this is stuff i learned on CG btw
 MSmits: greedy solutions and hill climbing
 AntiSquid: essay probably
 MSmits: maybe thats a better word yea
 ZarthaxX: smito is the CG student
 MSmits: its 6000 words max
 MSmits: I use the TSP as a context, but my improvement is to add more contexts and a clearer step-by-step plan to applying greedy solutions and hill climbing
 eulerscheZahl: smits climbing the hill to bring back the 10 golden rules for his students
 MSmits: yea&#160;:)
 MSmits: as empirical evidence i did a short test with my students where i also tried to get them to figure out the backpack problem and such
 MSmits: without ever having explained it
 MSmits: to see if they could find a greedy solution
 AntiSquid: oh my sounds like an actual paper though :P
 MSmits: most couldn't, which is why i think i need more contexts 
 eulerscheZahl: backpack? you mean knapsack?
 MSmits: right yeah, sorry its rugzak here = backpack
 MSmits: i meant knapsack
 eulerscheZahl: Rucksack here
 MSmits: similar
 AntiSquid: bindle algorithm /s 
 MSmits: i figured that if they see greedy solutions applied in more than 1 context (besides the TSP), it would make sense to them in a completely new context also
 AntiSquid: no? Automaton2000 i failed again&#160;:(
 Automaton2000: you can have a look
 MSmits: also darkhorse64 dont you think you will be too busy defending your clobber to do c4&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so many new games
 MSmits: these are games you can write a bot for in less than a day
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't want to&#160;:(
 MSmits: i mean i did both of them in a few hours only, which means you can do it in less than an hour
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather like to add more content to your TODO list
 MSmits: you're good at that :P
 eulerscheZahl: but the dice rotation animation is still buggy
 AntiSquid: idk kingdomino port isn't as fun on cg as in real life
 eulerscheZahl: have you ever tried animating such a thing? it's a nightmare
 MSmits: 3D rotations&#160;? Yeah
 MSmits: using quaternions?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, but that part is outsourced to the library
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: the problem: i want to know the absolute rotation values at each time
 MSmits: one time i had a student working on a drone (this was as a physics teacher) and he came to me to ask me some questions. I figured it'd be easy to help him
 eulerscheZahl: the library wants deltas
 MSmits: and then his first question was about quaternions :P
 MSmits: ah i see
 kovi: tryandcatch is on fire. msmits you should try somehing which is not mcts
 kovi: (and fireworks is on catch)
 MSmits: looks like a great game kovi, tryangle catch i think yo mean
 MSmits: but i am working on a different euler masterpiece atm
 eulerscheZahl: i like bad puns
 kovi: i failed with that combo
 MSmits: nah it was fine, i am just bad at recognizing these puns
 kovi: fireworks is catching up - would have been better
 MSmits: I'm not that great at graph stuff also. Unless it's the simple tree kind we use in mcts and bfs and such
 MSmits: tryangle catch is really an advanced graph game
 MSmits: with adding and removing branches
 struct: euler do you know if I add text input on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/H4Ere6s.png">https://i.imgur.com/H4Ere6s.png</a> if it will be saved?
 MSmits: more importantly, does it become illegal when you turn legal off?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, no idea
 struct: ok, I was thinking on adding text input so you could choose board color
 eulerscheZahl: my player colors (list of multiple options) gets saved
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if part of the toggle module or stored somewhere else

 struct: From what I read I cant really find where they add it
 jacek: cargo cult programming eh
 eulerscheZahl: must be stored somewhere. feed it into a toggle state without using that specific toggle?
 Scarfield: nice die euler, but its not a true die, opposites must sim to 7
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sim sum dim sum or I die
 jacek: diefield 7
 jacek: stupid stockfish doesnt support gensfen for chess960
 MSmits: 'whats a gensfen?
 jacek: plays semirandom games and generates positions and labels them for certain depth
 MSmits: mmh ok
 MSmits: why do you want that
 jacek: i train my nn. but instead of using my crappy chess engine, why not use the best engine's evaluations?
 MSmits: i gues that would help
 jacek: quick &amp; dirty tests from learning on such 10m positions gives ~55% winrate on standard position
 jacek: against my best model
 MSmits: I see
 jacek: and ~30% on chess960 overall
 MSmits: i am just trying not to get my bender magnetocuted
 Scarfield: how many inputs for your chess nn jaNNek?
 jacek: 2432
 MSmits: whoa
 Scarfield: 38 inputs per cell? why that many?
 jacek: 64x38
 jacek: empty, 12 pieces, and wether pawn is attacked and/or protected by other pawn
 jacek: x2 for side to move
 darkhorse64: A sort of simplified NNUE
 Scarfield: ah makes sense
 jacek: only few squares are changed
 jacek: was thinking about adding passed pawn, bad bishop etc. though there would be slow down due to more squares being changed each move
 darkhorse64: updating is only partial and therefore faster
 Scarfield: ƎUИИ
 jacek: dleifracs
 jacek: and sf folks tell me they dont care about training chess960
 MSmits: sf?
 jacek: stockfish
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: you know sf folks?
 jacek: asked on their discord
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: they should care about chess960
 MSmits: why not broaden your horizons
 MSmits: chess960 is kind of a better game than chess :P
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/54qY4B1.png">https://i.imgur.com/54qY4B1.png</a>
 darkhorse64: You have no problems playing chess960 if you know how to play chess but you really have to think from move 1 instead of bashing 10 moves in 5 minutes
 MSmits: he liked your avatar though, thats something
 jacek: actually i wonder if training on chess960 would make the net more aware of chess than fixed opening
 jacek: and quick learning on 30m positions gives 60% winrate on standard opening :tada:
 darkhorse64: 30m positions&#160;?
 jacek: 30 millions
 Enknable: if the moves are within chess's solution space then it wouldn't be any different? But you'd be training some moves that could never happen.
 jacek: well exactly. human can generalize more and deal with impossible what if scenarios
 jacek: i think this was somewhat an idea behind double q-learning
 jacek: deal with environment but sometimes use randomly reward from stored experience
 jacek: either i really change sf code or train on standard opening then later retrain on all openings
 AntiSquid: John Connor always wins
 MSmits: are you doing  a terminator marathon or what?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: didn't really like the movies, except maybe part 4, was ok at best
 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: my favourite part in all terminator movies: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8RMUSmIGCI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8RMUSmIGCI</a>
 MSmits: thats evil 
 MSmits: :P
 ANONYMOUS42: what a time to be alive
 MSmits: yeah 22:26
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what is a good opening move in connect 4?  My mcts seems to like 3.
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59458ca85b08f914f150d1ccf0350fe7b233">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/59458ca85b08f914f150d1ccf0350fe7b233</a>
 jacek: someone's meta would agree with you
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e30500fd-fdd7-412e-8ed0-9e3efd4b32d2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e30500fd-fdd7-412e-8ed0-9e3efd4b32d2</a>
 MSmits: this makes it a very bad opening move, because your opponent can steal it UnnamedCodinGamer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am testing locally
 jacek: lets make connect960 with random openings
 MSmits: sounds like you're on the right track
 MSmits: fine with me&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: from time to time it likes also 5
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but they are symmetrical I guess
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: identical
 MSmits: thats why my meta mcts doesn't even search that
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 MSmits: on every expansion my meta mcts applies every transformation in a game (rotation mirror etc.) and if anyone of the results have been encountered before, it skips that child
 UnnamedCodinGamer: nice
 MSmits: connect4 only has the one vertical axis
 MSmits: but yavalath has 12
 MSmits: 12 transformations that is
 MSmits: nine mens morris has way more even
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: I think it's 48
 jacek: its just square
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: it has 3 concentric squares
 MSmits: you can put them in any order
 MSmits: and the game is the same
 MSmits: which adds another 6 times as many transformations
 MSmits: 6*8 = 48
 jacek: i dont believe you
 MSmits: thats a healthy attitude, go check it out :P
 MadKnight: u guys all did bulls &amp; cows&#160;?
 MadKnight: #2
 darkhorse64: I did it
 creeperZnation4: What's bulls &amp; cows?
 AntiSquid: an animal farm
 creeperZnation4: ...
 creeperZnation4: How do you "do" an animal farm XD
 MSmits: not sure i want to know
 creeperZnation4: :laughing:
 darkhorse64: Clobber lb is completely random, same code #4, #5, #1
 MSmits: well it's random because bots are nearly the same strength
 darkhorse64: ^
 darkhorse64: I got very lucky on this one 73% winrate
 MSmits: ncie
 MSmits: got very unlucky on my typing
 darkhorse64: I have the same skills
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: i think i may finally have solved bender 4
 MSmits: testcases still running... so many
 MSmits: euler really went all out on this one
 MSmits: 30 testcases i think
 MSmits: all succeeded, lets hope my submit does as well
 MSmits: yay&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: 50 more XP&#160;?
 MSmits: does it give xp? It's an optim
 MSmits: rank 37 now, just from basic 100%
 darkhorse64: no XP then, CP
 MSmits: out of 878 on the leaderboard
 MSmits: so few get 100%
 MSmits: I gather multiple solutions per try, so i should do a check to find the shortest
 MSmits: meh 5270 -&gt; 5202 not very helpful&#160;:)
 MSmits: tied with 36th now&#160;:)
 MSmits: well thats it for now. I finished my weekend project, gn&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: gn
 UnnamedCodinGamer: gn
 NeumanAlkhalil: GN
 lexicons: oh nice a chat

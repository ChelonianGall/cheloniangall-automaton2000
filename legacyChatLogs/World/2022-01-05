 zoroarkmeister: i dont know how to complete the race
 5DN1L: Is it Mad Pod Racing?
 zoroarkmeister: yes
 zoroarkmeister: i am new
 5DN1L: Which league are you in?
 zoroarkmeister: lua
 zoroarkmeister: i can change it if you want
 5DN1L: Erm not the language
 5DN1L: I mean league
 5DN1L: Is it Wood 3?
 zoroarkmeister: i am in thw first
 zoroarkmeister: the
 5DN1L: ok
 zoroarkmeister: i just startet with ai
 5DN1L: First you need to learn to where to find your league
 5DN1L: It's in the top left corner
 5DN1L: can you see it?
 zoroarkmeister: no
 zoroarkmeister: you mean mad pod racing
 5DN1L: yes
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 5DN1L: next to the name
 5DN1L: there's the league
 zoroarkmeister: you mean my lvl
 5DN1L: It should say something like "Mad Pod Racing  Wood 3 League "
 zoroarkmeister: not here
 zoroarkmeister: it just says mad pot racing
 Uljahn: i guess bot ai multiplayer games might be hard for a complete beginner
 zoroarkmeister: oh
 5DN1L: are you?
 5DN1L: do you know the basics of Lua?
 zoroarkmeister: yes i am a beginner is startet today
 zoroarkmeister: no
 ____Z_X_C____: lol
 5DN1L: Oh that's a problem
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 5DN1L: ____Z_X_C____  You've got messages in the forum about your puzzle
 ____Z_X_C____: o
 5DN1L: zoroarkmeister  If you don't know anything about Lua yet, you'd better learn it elsewhere, then come back to practise here
 zoroarkmeister: so
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 zoroarkmeister: i already know how to make it move to the first checkpoint
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 5DN1L: hope to see you again
 5DN1L: oh right?
 zoroarkmeister: me to
 5DN1L: You can of course continue to try here
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 5DN1L: but if you find it hard, better learn something elsewhere first
 zoroarkmeister: is there something else
 zoroarkmeister: in this wepsite
 5DN1L: well, you can try: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 zoroarkmeister: to learn lua
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 zoroarkmeister: i will try
 5DN1L: but other than that part, most parts on the website require you have some basic knowledge of a language
 zoroarkmeister: ok what now
 zoroarkmeister: oh
 zoroarkmeister: well we will see
 5DN1L: Yes&#160;:)
 zoroarkmeister: soo i am here now what do i do next
 5DN1L: try to look for things of interest here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 5DN1L: and try out some puzzles if you want
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 5DN1L: you can learn and google along the way
 zoroarkmeister: yes
 5DN1L: if you find it too difficult, pick up the knowledge elsewhere first and come back here later
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 zoroarkmeister: wait
 zoroarkmeister: i cant find puzzles for lua
 zoroarkmeister: and there is no lua at the filters
 5DN1L: oh...
 5DN1L: didn't expect that :P
 zoroarkmeister: ok
 zoroarkmeister: then i will try more with the pod
 5DN1L: yeah, or the puzzles here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 zoroarkmeister: yes

 nesnes112: Hi everyoneI want to write a javascript instruction which allows to replace each s (not followed by c) in a string by scthis is what I wrote but it didn't work
 nesnes112: let w=word.replace('s([^c])','sc');
 Merfi: yes my friend, thats goodt. but just remember to be the change that you wish to see in the world
 Almin5k: Hello nesnes just remember life isn‚Äôt finding shelter in the storm. It‚Äôs about learning to dance in the rain. Keep trying, and you will find a solution :muscle:

 bmacho: when I'm online people follow me and invite me to clash 
 bmacho: even when i don't do anything
 bmacho: where do they see that im online anyway
 5DN1L: your profile
 5DN1L: a green dot at the upper right corner
 5DN1L: of your profile pic
 bmacho: but where they see my pfp
 5DN1L: in the chat
 bmacho: no
 bmacho: i dont write here
 5DN1L: if they have followed you then they can get to see your profile easily too
 Wontonimo: if you follow them then they can message you offline
 Wontonimo: *message you when you are offline
 5DN1L: anyway if you don't like to see clash invites, you can turn it off in your settings
 bmacho: it's a mystery then 
 Wontonimo: if you don't want to see this chat , you can add ?disableChat to the end of the codingame url and it will remove this side chat
 bmacho: yeah i turned off all the notifications
 bmacho: wow!
 bmacho: I'll try that too, thx
 RomainBourel: hello it's my firs time on this website. I'm jr. I understand what we must do but don't know how take the argment and return the new
 Wontonimo: which puzzle arer you working on?
 RomainBourel: I'm on a clash (I think it wasn't good idea for first try)
 RomainBourel: i used php
 Wontonimo: the way this site works is that data is sent to your program via stdin
 Wontonimo: and your program must respond with stdout

 nesnes112: hi
 nesnes112: what is the equivalent of this python instruction in javascript
 nesnes112: print(ans.center(n,a))
 Wontonimo: i don't know what center does
 nesnes112: center the display of the result
 Wontonimo: what's n and a?
 nesnes112: I wrote to you in private Wontonimo
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Wontonimo: scary, I know
 Wontonimo: hey nesnes112, just ask your question here
 Wontonimo: you've spent about 5 min asking me in private chat if you can ask me.  just ask.  don't ask to ask
 nesnes112: ok
 jacek: but what if he cant
 Wontonimo: I think that is actually the problem, he doesn't know how to ask
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_center.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_center.asp</a> assuming ans is string
 Wontonimo: he wants to start a video call and walk through his whole operation
 nesnes112: which javascript instruction equivalent to this python instruction
 jacek: and in javascipt probably there would be something like padStart and padEnd
 nesnes112: print(x.center(n,a))
 jacek: but i dunno javascript, just quickly googled this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55890994/string-pad-center-using-javascript">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55890994/string-pad-center-using-javascript</a>
 nesnes112: n=number of lines
 Wontonimo: n = number of characters
 Wontonimo: a = character to use as filler (defaults to " ")
 nesnes112: a=character
 BlaiseEbuth: jacek: You probably should make a video call with him to show him how to use google.
 nesnes112: Blaise 
 nesnes112: thank you
 nesnes112: x=character

 nesnes112: BlaiseEbuth stop
 nesnes112: i don't need your help
 icecream17: what happened to "no programmer should have to wait"
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not helping you. I'm trying to make you understand (with a lot of subtlety) that you can search by your own. :rolling_eyes:
 Wontonimo: nesnes112 , although BlaiseEbuth is being very cheeky , it's helpful.  He's a funny one.  Don't take it badly please.
 icecream17: Also what's the difference between  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/atari-go">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/atari-go</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/atari-go-9x9">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/atari-go-9x9</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: -9x9
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Many people in these weirdo countries don't know how to google.  Like 90% of them think FB is the internet
 Wontonimo: one is 9x9, one is not&#160;?
 icecream17: Oh the preview on the non-9x9 one shows a 9x9 board so i got confused
 icecream17: In fact wood 4 is also 9x9?
 jacek: one is always 9x9, the other is 9x9 13x13 and 19x19
 Wontonimo: i haven't dug into either.  use NN with killermove
 jacek: one bot will work in both if you didnt hardcode the size
 icecream17: ok
 jacek: NN with killer move?
 BlaiseEbuth: A terminator
 jacek: sounds something what Automaton2000 would say
 icecream17: my strategy for 9x9 was just 180deg copy
 jacek: oh
 Automaton2000: i need to catch up on
 icecream17: it got to wood 3 somehow
 icecream17: Wow, someone beat me by taking a stone on move 200
 Wontonimo: add in to avoid placing on the outside for the first 1/3rd of the game
 Wontonimo: copy 180 if not on outside, else place randomly
 Drex19: It look pretty easy
 Wontonimo: Atari Go looks easy Drex19&#160;?
 Drex19: i don't think so
 ReetFun: Does someone has a good tutorial to create an application with Kotlin or Java&#160;?
 D.Bruce: Would anyone be able to help me with the Power of Thor - Episode 1 in JS?
 5DN1L: D.Bruce what have you got so far?
 D.Bruce: Well I can get Thor to move in a stright line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  My issue is when the light isn't on a straight diagonal he doesn't turn, or stop moving once the X or Y axis' are equal to each other. 
 5DN1L: Sounds like you have to handle x and y variables separately
 D.Bruce: Thats what I am doing.  I'm not sure if its the most optimal way to do it, but I have two nested if statements, one for Y and one for X.  I can send what I have so far.
 5DN1L: ok

 Manchi_o6o7: Is someone having time to help me with some OOP questions on discord
 5DN1L: TeslaRam I think so. Not sure, but you may have to guide him to get through the initial onboarding puzzle though
 TeslaRam: thank you
 5DN1L: Manchi_o6o7 ask on discord directly
 Manchi_o6o7: In which room?
 5DN1L: help-solve-anything
 Manchi_o6o7: thanks, will do it right now
 5DN1L: D.Bruce are you still there?
 D.Bruce: Yea!
 5DN1L: Great
 D.Bruce: I just started a bootcamp a couple weeks ago and was told to check out this site
 5DN1L: I think your last "else if" in each of the if statements are wrongly placed
 5DN1L: though that shouldn't affect much
 D.Bruce: I felt like I wouldn't need them at all since the parent if statement wouldn't allow it to run if they were equal.
 5DN1L: exactly
 5DN1L: also
 5DN1L: there's thorX -+ 1
 5DN1L: typo there
 D.Bruce: Thank you for catching that.  I didnt even realize it
 5DN1L: does that fix the issue?
 D.Bruce: It just seems to set him on a path and does't really update with the while loop.  Thats why I tried to create a variable for his X and Y location so I can update it and run the if's off of his current location.
 D.Bruce: No it didnt help the indirect angles
 5DN1L: and oh
 5DN1L: you've let thorX = initialTx
 bmacho: anyone smart here and bored :eyes: 
 5DN1L: and let thorY = initialTy
 5DN1L: in every single while loop
 5DN1L: you're resetting it every time!
 D.Bruce: YES!  Okay, so hopefully its just a scope issue!
 D.Bruce: Yep, that was my issue!  Thank you very much!  I didn't understand why it didn't seem to be updated, but that is exactly why. 
 5DN1L: Good!
 5DN1L: Try learning debugging techniques
 5DN1L: Print variables to error stream
 5DN1L: this may help you too
 D.Bruce: As in console.log(error)?
 5DN1L: console.error('Debug messages...');
 PrivateJelly_96ae: hi, has anyone here got 100% on 'The Lucky Number' challenge with java?
 PrivateJelly_96ae: i pass all the test cases when i run my code in the ide
 5DN1L: D.Bruce console.log is for outputting answers, console.error is for debugging
 D.Bruce: Okay, i will look into this more!  Thank you again for your help!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 PrivateJelly_96ae: but when i submit it i pass all the hidden test cases  apart from test case 3
 PrivateJelly_96ae: can't seem to work out what's causing the issue
 5DN1L: oh it's almost the same numbers as the corresponding revealed test case
 5DN1L: try testing your code with 3628+/- a small number
 5DN1L: PrivateJelly_96ae
 PrivateJelly_96ae: thank you, I'll give it a shot
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 PrivateJelly_96ae: got it 
 PrivateJelly_96ae:&#160;:)
 PrivateJelly_96ae: thank you, been working on it for days loool
 5DN1L: Great :D
 5DN1L: Yeah it's a difficult puzzle
 bmacho: i've got that for a code interview, and I failed it 
 5DN1L: Are you going to solve it here?
 bmacho: i solved it after 
 5DN1L: nice
 bmacho: i definitely should have done it in an hour&#160;:) 
 bmacho: but thx
 bmacho: BTW do you think that the skynet-2 is solvable in polynomial time? 
 bmacho: it's a general game, and games don't tend to be solvable. Except if there is something to exploit in the rules, but I don't think so 
 5DN1L: I don't major in programming and I haven't learned the concept of polynomial time well, so... can't really answer your question, sorry
 bmacho: :D 
 bmacho: I see
 Wontonimo: polynomial time is HUGE.  why do you think it wouldn't be solvable in polynomial time?
 bmacho: bc it's a total random 2 player game, which generally aren't even in NP 
 bmacho: if it's solvable, there must be something exploitable in the rules
 bmacho: but I don't think there is anything 
 bmacho: some people claiming this in the problem forum, and the official solution explanation ( as far as I understand it ) is faulty, as well  every claimed solution I've seen 
 bmacho: pass the tests, but not working on other inputs
 XnbX: can someone help me

 nabaztag: Hi, i need a little help to understand a function of this code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a>Exactly this: uint16_t randomBit(uint16_t availableMoves) { // to get a random move
 nabaztag: (i dev in java ...)
 Leeeooo: What is this shit&#160;?
 Outsmarted: i've got unbanned
 Outsmarted:&#160;:)
 Leeeooo: LET'S GOOOO&#160;!!!!!&#160;:)
 Outsmarted: tah le muscle orthonorm√©
 Leeeooo: Je parle fran√ßais le fou
 5DN1L: English only please
 Leeeooo: oups sorry bro&#160;!
 struct: nabaztag which part dont you understand?
 nabaztag: this function __builtin_ia32_pdep_si
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pdep">https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pdep</a>
 struct: basicly it will return the nth bit set at the mask
 struct: but not the index but it will return an int with only that bit set
 struct: _pdep_u32(2, 0b110001) returns 16
 struct: because the 2nd bit set is at bit index 4
 struct: so pdep would return 0b10000
 struct: which equals 16
 struct: the __builtin_ctzl returns the bit index
 struct: so it would return 4 in this example
 nabaztag: _pdep_u32(0b000001000, 0b011101010) return 0b001000000&#160;?
 struct: no
 struct: 0b000001000 == 8
 struct: that would return the 8th bit set
 Leeeooo: WHAT DID THIS CLASH&#160;???
 nabaztag: √©_√® so return 0b000000000 (0)&#160;? :D
 struct: wait i explained poorly I think
 struct: _pdep_u32(0b110, 0b110001)
 struct: return 48
 jacek: is this smits code?
 struct: because it will ignore the 1st bit set, and then get the 2nd bit set and 3rd bit set
 struct: so it would return 0b110000
 struct: so yes what you said was right
 struct: that example you showed would return 0b1000000
 justchris: does anyone know what is required to gain a skill in the profile "Skills" section?
 struct: When you solve a puzzle
 struct: you need to check a checkbox or something
 icecream17: its under (inside a puzzle) Results -&gt; what you learned
 justchris: I see, thanks!
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: wow, Lanfeust has solved every puzzle now
 struct: even freecell?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yep
 Leeeooo: Why do I always win&#160;?
 Outsmarted: Why am i born that strong
 nabaztag: thx struct, i got it 
 luis.fernandezm: Hi everyone! I have been practicing my js frontend skills for a couple of months but all of that I just been learning and watching videos, almost nothing about practicing. I havent been able to solve any of the clash of code that i have played. Any advice of how to practice or any website that could help? Thanks everyone
 5DN1L: What do you mean by not being able to solve any clash of code?
 luis.fernandezm: I havent been able to solve the problems of the games. I have a few ideas of howe to solve it but I ended up with nothing
 5DN1L: Is it just an issue of speed?
 ninjadip: try the regular puzzles first
 luis.fernandezm: Kind of, It takes me a lot of time 
 5DN1L: You may try the non-timed puzzles first
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 ninjadip: yea
 luis.fernandezm: Also I have some idea of how to solve it but it takes me time to take it to code
 luis.fernandezm: Thanks man! I'll give it a try!
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 jacek: try power of thor, the descent and temperatures first
 Leeeooo: I am a pedalo
 Outsmarted: lol
 Leeeooo: and not pedago
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you are a human-powered watercraft?
 Leeeooo: Yeah man&#160;!
 Leeeooo: I am an IT student in New Jersey from France&#160;!
 Leeeooo: LOUOULOU
 Leeeooo: FJSDKLFSKDJFKSQJFK
 Leeeooo: sry
 Leeeooo: it's late
 5DN1L: Next time it'll be kick-out :smirk:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I'm not sure why anyone would pretend to be in New Jersey
 ninjadip: for the taxes?
 thisisparham: hi guys
 BlaiseEbuth: It's winter. Better be in a new jersey than in an old one...
 umutozdemir: please share your code 
 umutozdemir: everyone üåà
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, share your code
 Automaton2000: and they are still there
 thisisparham: some one can help me?
 5DN1L: Question undefined.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: thisisparham, try the friends channel #fr
 JulienBrouille: man for 99% of all clash of code python looks too easy
 JulienBrouille: they finish so fast
 Remus_: that's what she saidoh
 JulienBrouille: hahahahaha
 jacek: oO
 JulienBrouille: to win a shortest clash do you need to write to smallest code^
 5DN1L: not necessarily
 jacek: yes
 jacek: smallest, working code :v
 VizGhar: most correct is first measure :P
 5DN1L: yes ^
 ninjadip: i think i have the smallest code because i'm the only one with 100%
 ninjadip: just have to wait it out...
 JulienBrouille: i just want the next thing in the tree 
 JulienBrouille: but you need 3 win in shortest
 JulienBrouille: and i'm using kotlin which make code size to the roof
 VizGhar:&#160;:) time to switch language
 VizGhar: You have like 15 minutes to google... I switched from kotlin to ruby for shortest mode and searched like mad man. Not that hard
 VizGhar: Or find some harded clash and be the only one who solves it
 VizGhar: 5DN1L you look like veteran here. Haven't seen you here about year back when I was most active
 5DN1L: i wasn't active when you were most active then :joy:
 VizGhar: makes sense :D
 5DN1L: :D
 jacek: oh my
 VizGhar: How much coding point is for the multiplayer contribution?
 5DN1L: coding points? you mean xp?
 VizGhar: ah yes sry
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/creating-your-own-puzzle">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/creating-your-own-puzzle</a>
 5DN1L: I don't know if there's a difference between regular puzzles and multiplayer puzzles
 VizGhar: i think not... thats why there are so many CoC contributions... very little effort necessary
 jacek: contributions are part of the quest tree
 5DN1L: i'm not going to finish that route, so i don't know what the second last quest is :P
 VizGhar: "Get your contribution approved"
 5DN1L: ah i see
 5DN1L: no distinguishing between regular and multiplayer puzzles after all
 5DN1L: even in the quest tree
 ninjadip: trying to decide next bot thing to do after my first one:mad pod racing
 5DN1L: thanks VizGhar
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 ninjadip: any suggestions
 VizGhar: not yet ninjadip where are you currently?
 ninjadip: VizGhar just got to gold level in the racing and i'm kind of done with it now. looking for my next bot puzzle that might be half as fun as it was when I started the racing one
 ninjadip: I got the code4life one up in front of me now, reading it
 5DN1L: yeah that game has a very different style
 5DN1L: it depends on what you like playing/improving really
 VizGhar: ah you are gold already? time to do some optimizations then... you can find most sense in trying Genetic Algorithms (probably best choice) or you can simplify search space and use BFS maybe?
 ninjadip: i know i need to get better/faster at parsing 
 VizGhar: parsing what?
 ninjadip: strings
 ninjadip: some people do it so fast on the clashing
 jacek: solve various puzzles
 VizGhar: ah... clashing :D you are changing topic like my wife :D
 ninjadip: I remember once semi-mastering regex in this one class, but when I went back to it I forgot lol
 VizGhar: you wont need regex most of the time while clashing... what language u use for clashes?
 5DN1L: strings and regex <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-of-the-rings">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-of-the-rings</a>
 ninjadip: I didn't bring up what I need to improve on, 5Dnl asked
 ninjadip: oh cool, funny name
 5DN1L: but it's not a bot game
 5DN1L: parsers though
 ninjadip: oh this looks cool
 VizGhar: uf... I wouldn't recommend that one :D that was pure frustration
 5DN1L: lol
 5DN1L: depends on the objective i think
 ninjadip: well this will be good for me, reminds me of when I used typing programs that were trying to be fun 
 ninjadip: this is funny
 jacek: Automaton2000 are you fun
 Automaton2000: it's not really a good place to learn programming
 5DN1L: Oh Automaton2000 you betray CG!
 Automaton2000: or i could just do a random rollout
 ninjadip: the old random roll-up...classic
 5DN1L: the chat bot picks up our lines in the chat like a parrot
 jacek: if you get a parrot and teach it to say 'parrot, parrot', youll get your own pokemon!
 5DN1L: lol
 VizGhar: :D
 VizGhar: At least he is not trying to overthrow entire civilization or does he? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: then it's just a matter of time
 VizGhar: o.O
 5DN1L: wow
 VizGhar: it... makes sense?
 5DN1L: I hope not
 jacek: Automaton2000 whats is the best game on CG
 Automaton2000: madknight i dont get the same effect
 VizGhar: meh... he's back as we know him
 Jojo_lasticot:  Good eveningI can't find a challenge how to do it?
 USSRpumpkin: Some of the challenges are based on chance right?
 ninjadip: i haven't seen that yet
 ninjadip: but i'm new
 USSRpumpkin: Oh ok
 USSRpumpkin: Ive been signed up for like a month or two now
 ninjadip: cool
 USSRpumpkin: Shadows of the knight - episode 1
 USSRpumpkin: try it
 ninjadip: ok
 USSRpumpkin: Im gonna try it too
 USSRpumpkin: Its very hard
 USSRpumpkin: I think Ima do something else
 USSRpumpkin: Im actually gonna go sorry
 USSRpumpkin: see you maybe
 ninjadip: yay i just finished brain fork
 ninjadip: pretty cool
 justchris: congratz!
 ninjadip: i was hoping i could test it's speed to others on a leaderboard... i put in this extra logic to be fast
 justchris: I'm not sure but i think it's just least amount of actions
 ninjadip: yeah that's how i had it
 justchris: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-of-the-rings/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/code-of-the-rings/leaderboard</a>
 justchris: its not this leaderboard?
 ninjadip: yeah but it says the leaderboard for that game isn't about speed, but shortest code
 justchris: I see
 Astrobytes: "Brain Fork" :rofl: such a creative name change
 ninjadip: what games are u playing
 justchris: right now im doing the puzzle Catching Up
 justchris: I'm also addicted to Clash of Code
 justchris: avoiding the acronym there
 AmineACH51: Hello
 justchris: I struggle with my Coders Strikes Back bot too
 AmineACH51: I have a crush in a girl
 AmineACH51: She married
 AmineACH51: Another guy
 justchris: try turning it in to a coding challenge, maybe that helps
 justchris: how about u ninjadip, whats your flavour?
 ninjadip: c++
 justchris: cool, what games?
 ninjadip: right now i jus started the "codingame sponsored contest" it only tells you how much input you are getting, nothing at what to do with it then output options
 ninjadip: well reverse engineering
 ninjadip: i got to gold in mad pod racing, i loved it. but i need a break
 justchris: do you use a simulation?
 ninjadip: what do u mean
 justchris: like simulating x turns ahead to get the best thrust + direction?
 ninjadip: oh
 ninjadip: no i just based it off hard math
 ninjadip: to calculate for drift
 justchris: damn, i tried that but i can only reach mid bronze
 ninjadip: no guessing
 ninjadip: i had to calculate my own velocity and learn all the checkpoints to steer to the next checkpoint before we cross the current one. all to go from silver to gold
 ninjadip: silver to gold is the hardest jump
 ninjadip: what is the strategy in bronze? what variables do they give you?
 justchris: i did a checkpoint manager class but it only affects thrust now, so if angle to next checkpoint is too narrow it slows down
 justchris: you get opponent position, next checkpoint, angle
 ninjadip: if you have a checkpoint class that is keeping track of the cordinates, then you should use it
 justchris: yea i was thinking about that but i didnt think it would help that much
 ninjadip: like if  my
 ninjadip: distance_to_checkpoint&lt;900 then steer to next one because your momentum will take you in the rest of the way
 ninjadip: but there's more to that logic to make sure you don't spin in circles lol
 justchris: do you disable thrust until you reach that checkpoint?
 justchris: i see
 ninjadip: at first i used brakes. then i took them all out and won races left and right
 justchris: cool
 ninjadip: i had a slowdown to approach checkpoint thing going on
 ninjadip: but the only time i eventually disabled thrust was per the angle being to oblique
 justchris: yeah makes sense
 justchris: im trying to build a simulator in c++ and train a NN on it 
 ninjadip: like the best advice is that, instead of slowing down to a checkpoint because your drift is too wild, account for the drift by  aiming to the opposite direction of the checkpoint so you can come in on full speed
 justchris: but i got a long way to go, im a rookie at c++, better at javascript
 ninjadip: i love c++, i need to switch it up more though
 justchris: yeah thanks, appreciated. that is probably the fastest way to gold for me at the moment
 ninjadip: yeah get that and like a proximity to activate shields and steer ahead for laps 2 and 3 after you learn the checkpoints and you'll fly
 justchris: thinking about the shields gives me anxiety lol
 ninjadip: its the shield attacking when you get two ships that should give you anxiety lol
 justchris: xD maybe one day my brain will be adapted to that kind of stuff
 Thorcode: orr better for mad (iff below gold), use velocity
 justchris: i dont get how i should use that, i saw it mentioned in a couple of places
 ninjadip: what? velocity?
 justchris: is it some kind of target offset?
 ninjadip: yes, for the drift. that's what i said earlier. that's the most important
 Thorcode: ah yeah ninja got gold
 ninjadip: speed_x= new_x-old_x; target_x-=speed_x;
 ninjadip: that's it
 Thorcode: acctually you don't need drift until gold
 ninjadip: that's bs, it's simple code, three lines
 ninjadip: that drift will get you right to gold
 Thorcode: you neeed to explain him abit about new_x
 ninjadip: they don't give you the speed variables until gold.. but you can easily calculate them yourself
 Thorcode: and how could he apply it
 ninjadip: like have a variable that stores the value of your current x before your new input so you can compare
 justchris: i did a custom checkpoint handler class that stores all checkpoints after first lap
 ninjadip: that's your speed, the difference from one cordinate to the other
 justchris: yeah im with you that far
 ninjadip: the checkpoint thing you really don't need to get to gold
 ninjadip: just the drift
 Thorcode: so you got your first oldx=0,oldy=0(this is out of the while true)
 Thorcode: then apply ninja form
 Thorcode: after that
 ninjadip: then right at the end of the while loop put oldx=newx and oldy=newy
 Thorcode: print(velX,velY)
 ninjadip: then on your new input from next loop you can calculate the difference
 ninjadip: you say if i'm going this fast in one direction but i'm aiming over here, then this will calculate where you SHould be aiming to account for drifting at full speed and still hitting your target
 ninjadip: if it helps use cerr to output your variables to the console to check if they are what you think they should be
 justchris: are we only talking about the x and y of my pod?
 ninjadip: yeah
 justchris: dont i need to put the target checkpoint x and y in there somehow?
 ninjadip: yes
 ninjadip: so target= checkpointx -speedx
 ninjadip: or something like that, depends on how you calculate your velocit
 justchris: ok i will try that
 justchris: thanks
 ninjadip: does that make sense
 justchris: i think so
 ninjadip: if you get that down you will kick some butt
 justchris: i read some guide about it and i really couldnt understand that
 ninjadip: yeah same here
 justchris: spent maybe 10 hours on it
 ninjadip: i glanced at and it wasn't what  i needed
 ninjadip: oh
 ninjadip: having classes for your ship data and oop code to do the logic instead of all in main, it will help when you get two ships in gold

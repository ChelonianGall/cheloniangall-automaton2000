 ADMAAVADMAAVYT: hi
 brand: hows it going 
 kaz-png: good
 FrancoisB: great!
 jacek: good morning
 kovi: morning
 BrokenGiant_95fb: hello
 BrokenGiant_95fb: anyone here develop app using asp.net core?
 Tuanas: simp
 Tuanas: simp.exe
 jacek: :thinking:
 ParallaxWave: 8D
 MSmits: 2 more and you got string theory
 jacek:&#160;:?:
 MSmits: jacek sry, lemme add some more context on that
 MSmits: 8 + 2 = 10
 jacek: :drum:
 kovi: night changes +3position uttt, -5 bt
 MSmits: nice job on uttt
 jacek: not so nice on bt
 kovi: i didnt submit at all!
 MSmits: I'm also working on uttt, new bot
 kovi: 5-10 is pretty close in both
 MSmits: but did you submit on bt?
 kovi: no
 MSmits: mmh ok
 kovi: jacek made it very close. and pamp pushed me to back
 jacek: huh? i see youre submiting now
 kovi: ofc. after i got back of the pack
 kovi: also i had ideas, which were mostly failed
 kovi: i was thinking that in bt with early termination it would be better to not reuse tree or at least clear scores
 kovi: but that made it worse
 jacek: youre not using solver yet?
 kovi: i think i do
 jacek: at least based on your output, at the end youre doing gazillion sims with score like 0.00001
 kovi: what i display is rate. last number is winner (-2=not fixed)
 jacek: ah
 kovi: (and yeah, i still run mcts even if winner is found from root)
 MSmits: yeah, heat up those server farms
 kovi: msmits you do mcts on bt with eptany thoughts on no tree reuse/weaking of previous scores?
 MSmits: i just reuse the tree
 MSmits: keep the scores
 MSmits: unless my node pool runs out, then i just reset it
 jacek: yeah, no point on clearing
 jacek: even if youre previous sims were misguided, current ones could be too. but at least you have some warm start now
 MSmits: if you got to some depth, the only score that was added to the node there, were from even deeper nodes. So if this node becomes the root, it's basically just  a headstart
 kovi: yeah, make sense it slowly changes to the right direction
 MSmits: the only thing that might be in favor of resetting is cache misses
 MSmits: your nodes might be spread out in memory due to dead branches being in between
 jacek: hmm maybe i should add tree reuse in bt :thinking:
 MSmits: the more branching a game has, the less useful it is
 MSmits: if you havent added it in oware, you really should, but i think you have
 jacek: yes
 jacek: bt has relatvely high bf
 kovi: interesting msmitsthan tree compression would make sense (keeping score)
 MSmits: well it would if it wasnt so expensive to actually compress a tree
 kovi: i dont think it is
 MSmits: might take several milliseconds and be worse than just resetting the tree I think. But worth a try I guess
 kovi: at least it is cheaper than no-reuse building the whole from scratch and no scores
 MSmits: it's basically copying maybe 50 megabytes of data spread out over 600 megabytes
 MSmits: in little chunks
 kovi: but if you do it in each turn it is not 600mb
 MSmits: true, but still a lot
 MSmits: if i do 100k rollouts and i expand 40 bytes worth of node * Nchildren with 10 children i get 40 megabytes of new data
 MSmits: i doubt it would be worth it
 kovi: yeah, i guess you copy 10mb from 50mb
 kovi: (just checked and i have similar numbers)
 MSmits: it's worth it when you're trying to solve locally and have memory constraints
 kovi: good point
 jacek: do you still run c4 solver?
 MSmits: solving using mcts solver is very memory intensive
 MSmits: yeah, when i am not at the computer, sec
 jacek: the suspence is killing me
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fc9677f-7610-4112-8ba9-412735877b02">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fc9677f-7610-4112-8ba9-412735877b02</a>
 MSmits: 3 is only going up
 MSmits: 0 and 1 might both be draws hard to say, or neither one of them is
 MSmits: i changed my bot to start with 1
 MSmits: and it doesnt steal 0
 kovi: hmm, copying is especially cheap with array-node-childblock...
 MSmits: true, you dont copy per child, you copy per set of children
 MSmits: btw, you also need to update your parent references
 MSmits: i have a "childindex"
 kovi: true
 kovi: same yeah
 MSmits: some people use a pointer for this
 MSmits: but I am obsessed with makign my nodes small
 kovi: we use array indexing at work
 MSmits: it's 32 bit vs 64 bit
 MSmits: my node is only 16 byte currently
 MSmits: so 128 bit
 MSmits: in uttt that is
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8262bb79-f359-4924-9fe9-4836808bd8fa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8262bb79-f359-4924-9fe9-4836808bd8fa</a>
 kovi: wow, that is nice. 128bit game state?
 MSmits: no, the game state is not on there at all
 MSmits: it's just a boardindex and a move index
 BhavYea: hellooo
 kovi: oh ok, i pack all together
 MSmits: you have the gamestate on the node?
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: so thats 10 integers on every node?
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: thats expensive to do
 MSmits: memory wise anyway
 MSmits: what i do is, i apply the moves during selection, but very simple, just 
 MSmits: inline void ApplyMove(int player)	{		boards16[player][boardIndex] |= 1 &lt;&lt; moveIndex;	}
 kovi: i see
 MSmits: i dont check for wins and all that
 kovi: for bt/uttt that make sense
 kovi: for bandas that would not work
 MSmits: in bt i do keep the state on the node
 MSmits: in bandas i do also
 MSmits: most games actually
 MSmits: but most board games have a 128 bit or even 64 bit gamestate
 MSmits: uttt can theoretically fit into 128 bit but it takes extreme compression, more likely it's 192 bit or more
 kovi: yeah it is easier to reproduce than decompress
 MSmits: I have my oware and onitama in 64 bit. Pretty sure noone else does this. I did some weird stuff to achieve this
 MSmits: not sure it's worth it
 jacek: *spoiler alert* its not :v
 MSmits: probably not&#160;:)
 MSmits: but my nodes are small
 kovi: i dont think either. 40 or 48 byte
 kovi: but for uttt it may make sense
 MSmits: for oware i have 5 bit per house, adds up to 60 bit, but a house may have more than 31 seeds, but because there can only be 1 house with more than 31 seeds, i store the overflow of seeds in the leftover 4 bit&#160;:)
 kovi:&#160;:)(even if i dont know oware at all)
 MSmits: it's 12 pits, each have seeds in them, simpest gamestate I know
 MSmits: simpler than uttt
 kovi: im having motivational problems after reaching top10
 MSmits: yeah, i did too and moved on, but i keep coming back after a few months
 MSmits: if you do what is fun, you'll be back eventually, nor not
 MSmits: or
 kovi: for a multiplayer which already runs for years
 jacek: chess?
 kovi: hard to tell what amount of additional work is needed
 kovi: for chess it could be infinite. looking at the literature
 kovi: at least in cg it is new
 kovi: i guess being new and having community focus raises motivation level
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: 5% focus
 kovi:&#160;:)
 MSmits: also a game being on CG for years doesnt necessarily mean people spent years on it. For uttt this is true, but for most other games it will not be. People spend at most a few weeks and then dont look back, with some rare exceptions
 jacek: :soccer:&#160;:/
 kovi: paper soccer is relatively new isnt it?
 jacek: it came at the same time bt did
 MSmits: not that new. Over a year for sure
 MSmits: there's nothing wrong with the game, it just never got popular
 MSmits: just like twixt
 MSmits: eric made both twixt and dots, for some reason dots and boxes got popular
 kovi: that is new for mei have only concentrated on cg contests up to now
 jacek: well its rather obscure. i played it at school on real paper
 jacek: as twixtpp is probably popular in france and nowhere else
 MSmits: ah I see
 kovi: yeah, we did d&amp;b and car racing
 ngdangtu: Do you guy know what is Tests Cases Relevancy?
 jacek: do test cases cover most cases and the edge cases
 kovi: msmits are you using mcts on d&amp;b?
 MSmits: no, I have no traditional search on D&amp;B. It's a weird game
 MSmits: after halfway through the game. The game is solvable
 MSmits: i use a complicated 1590 line solver for that part, but it's not so important
 MSmits: the 10 plies before that i use nimstring analysis
 MSmits: that's everything
 MSmits: when i came up with it, i was nr 1
 MSmits: then mikkla did it better
 MSmits: first 40 or so plies it's just random moves
 MSmits: mikkla said he just picks the first move (which imho is worse than random)
 kovi: that is why im thinking about mcts
 MSmits: well you could do a mcts with a short nimstring analysis at the end, i've thought about it
 kovi: with ept...and i would add my depth0 assessment in the end
 MSmits: but without the math, it's hopeless
 kovi: i dont even know what is nimstring...just parity
 MSmits: it's mostly parity yes
 MSmits: but has a lot of rules in D&amp;B
 MSmits: basically, you turn the entire game around with one well, or wrongly placed line
 kovi: true
 MSmits: i spent more time reading papers on D&amp;B than any other game combined
 MSmits: and there arent even that many papers on D&amp;B
 MSmits: i just read them many times :P
 jacek: please no spoilers
 MSmits: it's because you really *need* the math, as opposed to most other games
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i wont, dont worry&#160;:)
 kovi: that is the problem with these simple games
 MSmits: what is?
 kovi: that they have been already researched
 MSmits: hmm well, I had to think of a lot of new rules for my D&amp;B solver
 MSmits: they were not in the papers
 MSmits: the nimstring stuff was though
 MSmits: uttt is poorly researched as well
 MSmits: also CG often has somewhat different variations of the real game that have a real effect
 MSmits: like time limits
 kovi: i agree
 jacek: most games have time limit *.*
 MSmits: oware has a different best move soemtimes, depending on how close to the end you are
 kovi: and code limit to prevent heavy books/nn
 MSmits: it only works to prevent endgame books though
 MSmits: nns get enough space
 MSmits: and i never had an opening book over 10kb
 MSmits: even running one for months
 kovi: well...for std chess that would not be enough
 MSmits: the thing is, it's easy to get a large opening book, it's not easy for them to be good moves
 MSmits: good moves require tons of calculation time
 MSmits: that's the real bottleneck
 MSmits: not codesize
 jacek: its easy. just be google
 MSmits: my oware book is currently probably 4 kb if i properly compressed it
 MSmits: it is based on 8.5 million games
 MSmits: months of runtime on a single core
 MSmits: still losing half my games vs jacek as player 1 btw :P
 jacek: my bt bot is based on 3.8 mills games now. 2.5 days. use your resources efficiently
 MSmits: sure, but they are not all good games&#160;:)
 MSmits: my games are played by my bot, not semi-randomly
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: hii to all
 MSmits: hi Rocky[K.G.F.]
 karliso: why is codesize not a problem for nns?
 MSmits: it is a problem, it's not prohibiting though, for these simple boardgames.  Iam just going by what the NN-ers told 
 MSmits: did not try it myself
 MSmits: for a more complex game it could be a bigger problem
 Rocky[K.G.F.]: hi UIjahn
 jacek: i could use a bigger NN
 jacek: but i can't&#160;:(
 jacek: dat grammar
 kovi: yeah instead of 4x4 conv, use 8x8 direct solver&#160;:)

 YSF8: i have a question
 YSF8: i am currently trying to code in a game and it says i need to win to go to the next level
 YSF8: but i keep winning and staying the the same area and loose rank for some reason i was 4 and know 23k
 YSF8: what is the reasoning
 MadKnight: u have to submit and have it win the boss
 YSF8: how do i submit
 YSF8: i can play my code 
 YSF8: and i win the boss al the time
 YSF8: all*
 YSF8: Game Summary:YSF8 rank: 1Boss 4 rank: 2End reached
 jacek: test in arena, not play my code
 geppoz: puzzle of the week "Encounter surface" solved using only sum and products... not a single division nor any goniometric function or segment intersections

 jrke: is there any link for the referee of great escape

 jrke: oh thankds
 jrke: thanks*
 kovi: is it just me or bandas strongly favors p1?
 MSmits: I think it does, but it also favors whomever received the best position through random generation
 MSmits: this is why re curse hates it. If you can get past this, it's a fun game to code a bot for
 kovi: you mean there is no heuristic to catch a winner/saver move?
 MSmits: not sure what you mean
 kovi: other than being lucky and find it early
 MSmits: people play this game the way they do UTTT, mostly through random rollouts
 kovi: yeah, i meant that.and now i see the importance of book
 MSmits: it shortens the rollout
 kovi: giving 3-4 plies more
 kovi: yeah
 MSmits: but you can get to top 10 without it 
 MSmits: I think maybe 3-4 people use an endgame book
 MSmits: karliso, nagrarok and I. Maybe one more I missed
 kovi: maybe my rolloutcnt is low. i can only get 15-20
 MSmits: what do you mean 15-20?
 kishor_max: how to submit?submit button is not working'
 jrke: click on bottom right button 
 MSmits: Test in Arena?
 kishor_max: in clash of codes
 kishor_max: right bottom button is not working
 MSmits: kovi, let me do some tests so i can tell you rolloutcount
 reCurse: kovi: I warned you, games almost always start extremely favored for one player :p
 MSmits: yeah but thats not that bad really. All that does is make the top 10 less reliable. You can have fun writing a bot, get into top 10 and then not worry about whether you're really rank 8 or 3
 MSmits: then just move on
 reCurse: Not sure which language you're speaking right now
 reCurse: Is it Dutch?
 MSmits: lol, sometimes I reply to you, but it's really meant for everyone else :P
 reCurse:&#160;:(
 MSmits: just letting them know you can have fun with imperfect games&#160;:)
 reCurse: Forever outlier
 MSmits: whats that
 reCurse: 5% of 5%
 MSmits: that's you I think
 MSmits: well me too, but for different reasons maybe 
 jrke: i just discovered bandas is also interesting lol
 MSmits: kovi rollout count close to 50k * 4 sims per expansion. So 200k random playouts from 50k parent nodes
 MSmits: a little below that
 MSmits: in round 2
 MSmits: but this is with endgame book, i might get a small increase from cutting playouts short. Or the conditional check + lookup might cost too, i dunno
 reCurse: Endgame book for bandas?!
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Why?
 MSmits: I look up every state with 12 or less squares
 MSmits: makes random rollouts better
 MSmits: more exact
 MSmits: and shorter
 MSmits: i solve much sooner, it's why i am ranked 3 on average and not 10
 reCurse: I didn't think it mattered since game is so skewed in your favor (or not)
 MSmits: it matters less on average because of that, but this favor thing cancels out over many games
 reCurse: And since there's no pairing, your ranking is even more dependent on which side you got
 reCurse: So your improvement gets entirely drowned out
 MSmits: yes, so the margin is smaller
 MSmits: it doesnt, i tested it
 MSmits: it's pretty significant
 reCurse: Hmm
 reCurse: Maybe your eval is bad then? :P
 MSmits: what eval
 MSmits: i do it uttt-style
 reCurse: Oh random rollouts
 MSmits: i simply cut short the random rollout
 MSmits: it's like using a lookup for the last uttt board
 MSmits: the last miniboard
 MSmits: btw, this works fine, but no matter how hard I try, i can't seem to figure out how to do 2  miniboard lookup. Just too many states
 MSmits: can maybe do it locally, but definitely not in a live bot
 kovi: sorry was afk15-20 is leadeboard positionsim below 100k rollouts, so need to work on that
 MSmits: ahh ok
 ADMAAVADMAAVYT: can someone help me please i am new to the program
 KiwiTae: ADMAAVADMAAVYT welcome what do you need
 ADMAAVADMAAVYT: i would like like a tutoril like a vidieo is there something like that on this?
 ADMAAVADMAAVYT: also can u use this websit to code a game?
 Wontonimo: @ADMAAVADMAAVYT there are no video tutorials that I know of.  You can check out the live streams
 AntiSquid: there are some video tutorials
 AntiSquid: what tutorial are you looking for capsman&#160;?
 Wontonimo: You can make contributions on this site, like a clash-of-code, or a bot competition.  It isn't a stand-alone game that you could put on an app store
 Wontonimo: I didn't now about the videos, sorry.  There is definitely a lot of learning material here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 AntiSquid: capsman&#160;? ADMAAVADMAAVYT
 jacek: this site is not for complete beginner who doesn't know how to code at all. no total beginner tutorials here
 AntiSquid: nonsense, AutomatonNN and Automaton2000 both started here and look at their level progress
 Automaton2000: i haven't even started yet
 AutomatonNN: why do you think that it is a good one?
 AntiSquid: damn bots berating me ...

 Waffle3z: p`factor`.count(' ')==2&#160;?????? what is going on here
 Waffle3z: what is `factor`
 OnceAndFutureKing: repr() in python2
 Teddy.py: print all prime factors
 Waffle3z: where is `factor` documented, why does it specifically get the next thing out of stdin, convert it to a number, and get the number's factors, how is that specific behavior built into the language
 Waffle3z: and what's that notation

 Waffle3z: it's ruby
 OnceAndFutureKing: hah, that explains why it sounds weird
 Teddy.py: and in bash also work
 breadward: the back ticks in ruby call a system command if I understand correctly, in this case it's running the bash 'factor'
 Teddy.py: oh that makes sense
 breadward: if I'm understanding correctly lol, just learned about from a challenge on here yesterday

 taha-lyousfi: hi guys
 taha-lyousfi: does anyone have some advice for me to start competetive programming
 MSmits: seems pretty broad subject. 
 MSmits: There are speed-programming challenges. Those are very different from the bot coding we do here
 MSmits: the botcoding we do is more relaxed. Even contests give you 10 days generally. If you're not too busy with work or family stuff, it should be enogu
 MSmits: enough
 MSmits: but in any case, the advice is practice
 AntiSquid: taha-lyousfi yes
 nunu2021: hi all, i am soooooo excited to start!
 Sky_Rhett: where do i start programming as a high school student who knows nothyingf
 nunu2021: omg, im also a highschooler, but i do have some cs experience
 nunu2021: i would say learn one language a little bit, then practice the language on this site
 LuaCultist: I too am a highschooler! I would say start on a project you think you would enjoy making
 LuaCultist: You'll learn as you go
 LuaCultist: Make sure to know the basics of the languages/frameworks you will use first or it'll not end up too well

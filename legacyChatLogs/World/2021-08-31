 mufar: hey i have been take the first test for interview in codingame and there is a problem about how many robot visit the same start point, i dont finished yet because my time is out. So how i want to try that problem for practice? i have been search on google but i cant get it. Anyone can help me to find out the same problem in codingame or another website?

 Coder_noob001: do anyone know website for 1v1 clashing of codes
 Baltraz: i mean you can do private clashes
 AjinkyaJ: hi
 Coder_noob001: but private clashes questions wil be too simple
 Uljahn: why? aren't they random?
 Coder_noob001: they are random but the difficulty level of those questions will b very low
 TimothyAlexisVass: What are you talking about?
 WhaIe: @Coder_noob001 there's a website called binarysearch. You can create a private room, invite whoever you want, and solve harder problems
 Coder_noob001: thanks
 mufar: @DaNinja thank u

 Y.Srihari: Hi
 Y.Srihari: Can you answer my question 
 Wontonimo: i can, i am all knowning.  without even knowing the question I know the answer.  42.
 Wontonimo: jk, what's your question
 thunderegg: im new can i get help
 Wontonimo: ask here
 Wontonimo: be specific
 thunderegg: im new can i get help coding
 Wontonimo: what are you trying to code?
 thunderegg: im trying to compete in clash of code
 Wontonimo: how much coding experience do you have and in what language?
 thunderegg: im a noob but i started this to learn to code games
 thunderegg: in javascript
 thunderegg: or even help in coders strike back
 thunderegg: whats the code for coders strike back
 Wontonimo: i'll send you private message thunderegg

 thunderegg: what is that cade
 Wontonimo: that's php
 jacek: 404?
 Maxim251: I have interesting Question. When I have Base object BUILDING and I have assigned values in that obiect, and later on in game I want assigh child like "BUILDING *a = new BARRACK_ARCHER " its normal that all data from base class is deleted? 
 BlaiseEbuth: Isn't "new" clear enough?
 Maxim251: Yes, But new is for child class
 Maxim251: I am using inheritance using base class and child class
 BlaiseEbuth: And "=" is for "overwrite"
 Maxim251: then if I want change behavior of class to another, that means that assighning new behavior is rewritenning whole class? Not only replacing virtual functions?
 jacek: umm child class will have all the data of base class, and will overwrite virtual functions by default
 BlaiseEbuth: Not sure of what you're asking... If you mean changing the class at runtime, you can't.
 Maxim251: Then How I can change behavior of class, like my heroe can shoot, then my heroe drink poison, and my heroe canot shoot anymore?
 Wontonimo: instead of "is a" , refactor your code to be "has a"
 BlaiseEbuth: ^this
 Maxim251: Yes, that I mean, change it on run time, but keeping all data.
 Wontonimo: instead of your code "is a drunk archor", it "has" a list of effects
 Maxim251: Hm.... 
 Wontonimo: have a separate class called "effect"
 Wontonimo: one instance is 'drunk', or 'on fire'
 Wontonimo: and your hero has a list of effects
 Wontonimo: during your game loop, also iterate through all the effects of each entity
 Maxim251: and then at run time, how I can change behavior on run time?
 Wontonimo: each effect should keep track of such things as how long it should last
 Wontonimo: i think i just explained how
 Wontonimo: a bottle of vodka would create an instance of the 'drunk' effect and append it to the list of effects of the entity that drank it
 Maxim251: then updating hero, I should also update that list?
 Wontonimo: yeah.  the 'drunk' effect could have a time or turn expiration 
 Wontonimo: it's important that the code for the effect is in the effect class and not in the entity class
 jacek: your game loop logic would iterate over effects and apply things to the hero
 Maxim251: Because I am on Code Royal. The input is desighned that first I get empty fields for building structure. And I use base class of BUILDING, and create instance of EMPTY_FIELD to assighn this behavior. Then at the another for loop, I have game where ID of the field is given, indicating if I can build something on that place. If I decide to build something there, then I wand change behavior from EMPTY_FIELD, to BARRACK_ARCHER
 Maxim251: I want keep all data from base class like Id, x, y, Position, size, but also the new behavior of BARRACK
 Maxim251: Another idea what is coming on my mind, is make copy of all data, then assign new behavior and transfer back all data... But in My opinion, this don't have sense...
 Uljahn: guess it's easier to keep different types of entities like sites, buildings, units separated
 BlaiseEbuth: Muahaha! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/1ORFBSH">https://imgur.com/a/1ORFBSH</a> :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: so Thibaud is new? welcome Thibaud!
 eulerscheZahl: i only noticed that I had some old chat (private message) showing when I opened a new tab. then in another new tab I kept chatting more in that private message. That resulted in one of the older messages getting grouped
 eulerscheZahl: soeulerscheZahl (time): messageeulerscheZahl (time2): message2
 eulerscheZahl: became eulerscheZahl (time): message message2

 Maxim251: Then I try change behavior Site[count] = new BARRACK_KNIGHT;
 Wontonimo: that is so weird BlaiseEbuth ... what the heck?!?!

 BlaiseEbuth: Wontonimo I really thought you were joking with tibo at start ^^
 eulerscheZahl: one day CG had a funny bug where it showed the same profile pic for every user
 Wontonimo: the private messages really seemed like an ethical test tbh.  stuff like "send me the code" and such
 Wontonimo: if I was into conspiracies, I'd say this all was very suspicious.  but i'm not, so instead I'll say "what a funny coincidence" 
 BlaiseEbuth: I fail such ethical tests... I alaways kill the guy. Not really ethic.
 Wontonimo: if your country is at war with the other country and you've been told to or you are "defending" yourself then somehow it becomes okay.  Maybe you are just defending yourself from their attacks on your sovereignty. 
 Wontonimo: sounds like Tshirt"it's not Murder,I'm defending the sovereignty and tranquility of my mental well being"
 Dev_DZ: :rolling_eyes:
 JHowell: Where can we find the puzzle of the week? My notification went away when I clicked on another notification X, and now I can't find it.
 MeBen: Somehow I got promoted to Wood 1 from Wood 2 without changing anything
 jacek: where
 MeBen: Space Shooter
 JHowell: I've gotten promoted a couple times without changing my code and coming back after a couple weeks. Sometimes there's more weaker players and so you win more games and get a higher score.
 MeBen: Still don't quite know how those League games work
 jacek: you should be higher than boss in leaderboard and youll get promoted automatically
 jacek: boss was so weak a random bot could beat it
 JHowell: Ooh, is Space Shooter new? I think I remember seeing it recently in Contributions.
 MeBen: Seems like it. It gave me some new features when I reached the new League, like missiles and stuff. Apparently they're not needed.
 jacek: some games have new rules in higher leagues

 Westicles: is that a new thing?
 Westicles: or a private clash thing?
 samtheman_: can someone help me wih the second bot level I just started and am really confused
 Westicles: CSB?  I know a guy
 BrunoFelthes: What is the meaning of the coding game icon?
 KalamariKing: so many questions all at once
 KalamariKing: BrunoFelthes it could just be a cool logo
 KalamariKing: samtheman_ for what bot battle
 Westicles: okay, well now I also want to know what the logo signifies
 BlaiseEbuth: There was an explanation on dsicord months ago... Search the logs
 Westicles: That's okay, I'll just assume it is a little leaning bot man
 Westicles: With no arms or neck and wearing a dress
 BlaiseEbuth: :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: Found it. Here's the explanation <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/vY6IfT_pZFk?t=31">https://youtu.be/vY6IfT_pZFk?t=31</a>
 eulerscheZahl: welcome back BrunoFelthes. haven't seen you in ages
 BlaiseEbuth: Just the last 'e' of "CodinGame" that ejaculate.
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: On a yellow post-it. :thinking:Probably a subliminal message to say that agile is intellectual masturbation.
 eulerscheZahl: i know i'm bad at interpreting art. always hated that in school. but you are much worse
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... You're right, perhaps the 'e' is spitting... :thinking:
 BrunoFelthes: hi @eulerscheZahl, I'm more active at the challenge time
 eulerscheZahl: most of us are
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if the fall challenge will be what we are hoping for
 BlaiseEbuth: 5% talking
 jacek: escape thing?
 eulerscheZahl: that's exactly what i'm not hoping for
 BrunoFelthes: What are you hoping for?
 eulerscheZahl: there is the new toy of CG: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/games">https://escape.codingame.com/games</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and this forum post: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/3">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/3</a>
 Astrobytes: I am less than confident.
 eulerscheZahl: and the statement "we don't know if it will be a multiplayer game yet" (quoted from memory) which was told 1-2 months ago
 jacek: have more hope. maybe it would be long clash
 BlaiseEbuth: Do not trust to hope. It has forsaken these lands.
 Astrobytes: Plus the omission of contest type on the contest page.
 BrunoFelthes: But, what is a solo game, if it is not an optmization problem?
 eulerscheZahl: an escape room
 BrunoFelthes: meh....
 jacek: escape from CG
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LivwEyf_q8I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LivwEyf_q8I</a>(haven't watched before, probably contains spoilers)
 Astrobytes: That's what many will do I fear.
 BlaiseEbuth: "You're a 5% guy, CG fucked up. You have to... Escape from CG"
 BrunoFelthes: it should not be at the CG challenge schedule, they could do it beside the challenge
 eulerscheZahl: you sound reasonable
 eulerscheZahl: fix it
 Astrobytes: BrunoFelthes: It's not about it being at the same time - it's going to be a replacement for the usual contests (whatever it is)
 eulerscheZahl: in the end CG wants to make money to pay the bills. they have this new format and want to promote it. having such a contest sounds like a good way to do so (advocatus diaboli speaking)
 Astrobytes: Sure. It's sensible in some way, somewhat alienating in another.
 BlaiseEbuth: I never hired you eulerscheZahl...
 Astrobytes: :P
 BrunoFelthes: the hiring tool is not profitable?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hiring contest!
 Astrobytes: It is, and they're growing it
 eulerscheZahl: just offering team building events on top of the hiring
 Astrobytes: But the escape room idea is going to be what they push to companies for teambuilding/hackathons instead of the usual contest format
 eulerscheZahl: in the past they organized private clash of code rounds and some variation of old contest games
 BrunoFelthes: very sad...
 eulerscheZahl: they won't continue with the old contests (i don't know the reason)
 Astrobytes: We shall wait and see what transpires.
 BlaiseEbuth: You?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 months and we know more
 BrunoFelthes: Maybe we will need to go to kaggle?
 Astrobytes: Eugh.
 Astrobytes: If there is no real contest, there is no RAIC either, I will wilt and die.
 BrunoFelthes: @eulerscheZahl are you the toad brigade at the lux competition?
 jacek: i never tried other hackaton things. CG so far is the best, why it promotes crap like clash or escape :c
 BrunoFelthes: agree @jacek
 eulerscheZahl: i don't play Lux AI
 jrke: is there any chance of community contest in future like OOC?
 eulerscheZahl: very unlikely
 Astrobytes: That's it in a nutshell jacek. CG is the best out of them all.
 eulerscheZahl: they even consider OoC as a mistake
 jrke: why?
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, forgot about that. 
 jacek: yes, it was mistake it wasnt :notebook: :soccer:
 eulerscheZahl: and turned down TryAngle Catch despite being almost ready
 Astrobytes: TAking contestants away from the Spring Challenge
 eulerscheZahl: "canibalizing their 2 major contests"
 Astrobytes: What was the one after OOC anyway?
 jrke: SC20 i think
 Astrobytes: I know THAT :D
 jrke: the pacman
 Astrobytes: I mean what was the game :D
 jacek: starcraft 2020?
 Astrobytes: Oh, that.
 jrke: what was the reason behind starting community contest?
 jrke: when they did first time?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't have to create contest themselves...
 eulerscheZahl: but then it turned out that mentioning users with mediocre Java experience takes even more time than doing it on your own
 eulerscheZahl: plus some discussion about the rules, keeping complexity somewhat low for the "easy to enter" part
 jacek: onitama is easy, so it all checks out
 500plus: is it possible to order tasks from easiest to hardest. I have just begun and obtained a task with LOOP with SORTING which is advanced I think
 jacek: clashes are random
 500plus: so I shouldnt have chosen Algorythims for a start?
 BlaiseEbuth: That's puzzle
 jacek: try easy puzzles. they are predictable
 500plus: I took Horce-racing Duals as a first task
 BlaiseEbuth: sorting is not really advanced
 jacek: welp the point of pony racing is sorting. some language have built-in sorting functions
 500plus: I am in Classic puzze categgory - Easy. How to know the task is easy by its name 
 BlaiseEbuth: Difficulty is a personnal feeling... The puzzle categories are just indicative
 jacek: most of them are easy. but "easy" is different for every individual
 500plus: Jacek so I am allowed to use for example Array.Sort&#160;?
 jacek: yes
 500plus: oh thats more simple then
 jacek: graph things sound 'hard' but im used to graphs. string manipulation is 'easy' but i havent done much in this field, so its harder for me
 Allison: Easy puzzles being predictable makes me feel dumb af.&#160;:(  I can't figure out the stupid Enigma machine one..... 
 eulerscheZahl: some are just no fun to solve. it's perfectly fine to skip them and try a more interesting one
 500plus: do you think this games will improve your skills in general or only the specific once&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Depends if you learn something from it or not 
 Astrobytes: (something new)
 500plus: solving can be cosidered as learning right&#160;?
 Westicles: I still have to google how to read in space separated input in c++, after hundreds of times
 Astrobytes: Otherwise, can be helpful to get used to using some techniques
 Astrobytes: lol Westicles, not unusual :D
 jacek: game consists of simulation and appriopate algorithm to use it
 BlaiseEbuth: std::cin &gt;&gt; Westicles;
 jrke: happens Westicles like i have one thing that i always forgot - 'reading and writting JSON in python' i have added bookmark for that sol so i always look at it
 jacek: echo BlaiseEbuth &gt; /dev/null
 BlaiseEbuth: deluser jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: rm -rf /hom/jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Folder autocompletion doesn't work on the chat. :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl:  /hom?
 BlaiseEbuth: As I said
 jacek: nyoro~n
 eulerscheZahl: "home is too much to type, i'll better just write hom and then tab to save a total of 0 key hits"
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i do those all the time :D
 jacek: like using up up up up arrow until you hit rm
 jacek: instead of just typing rm
 Illedan: Always up arrow
 jrke: euler looking at your module i saw that you replace normal viewer with your div right?can we not directly add content to pre defined viewer?
 jrke: like viewer.appendChild()
 eulerscheZahl: might work as well, wasn't sure. wanted to kill the pixi canvas as it still costs CGU resources
 Astrobytes: CGU?
 AllYourTrees: codingame university
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Costly Graphical Units
 eulerscheZahl: GPU&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: was in a hurry, hungry cat
 BlaiseEbuth: Cat Get Ungry
 Astrobytes: Mine are asleep thankfully. They were very 'lively' earlier.
 Astrobytes: lol BlaiseEbuth
 jacek: :3
 BlaiseEbuth: Mine is 'lively' outside.
 eulerscheZahl: mouse in my room :o
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: stealing peanuts
 Astrobytes: Well, the cat is hungry . . .
 eulerscheZahl: entered through the open window
 BlaiseEbuth: Take back the cat plate!
 eulerscheZahl: i'll try to get her
 Astrobytes: catch the mouse
 Astrobytes: And film it please :P
 jrke: try-cat catch
 Astrobytes: try-strangle mouse
 jrke: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Escape the toad
 Astrobytes: :D
 Westicles: that reminds me, need to watch that numberphile video to solve that stupid puzzle
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/in-australia-cane-toads-turn-to-cannibalism/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/in-australia-cane-toads-turn-to-cannibalism/</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, I saw that before jacek
 Astrobytes: Westicles: which puzzle?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh that one
 BlaiseEbuth: Numberphile is about people that rape innocent numbers?
 Astrobytes: Oh ffs
 jacek: keep the channel PG-13
 BlaiseEbuth: Porn Gay?
 jacek: as expected from former mod
 BlaiseEbuth: Pasta gorgonzola... I'm starving
 Astrobytes: Meh. Not fussed on Gorgonzola.
 jacek: omelette du fromage
 Westicles: I'd starve in france these days
 BlaiseEbuth: Why? 
 Westicles: Er, that cafe law thing
 jacek: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: pass sanitaire
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. You're not vaccinated?
 jacek: Oo
 Westicles: jk, I'm on my 3rd booster now.  Nothing to see here
 Astrobytes: I can't wait for my second one, I'll be able to stick to aircraft and communicate with Bill Gates over 5G! And get autism! And and and, it's just too exciting :D
 eulerscheZahl: so, now i have a cat watching out of the window and a mouse hiding under a cupboard
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Damn cats. Same as my two.
 BlaiseEbuth: Critical failure
 Westicles: Astrobytes, spike proteins in your ovaries I believe
 eulerscheZahl: should have just ignored it. the mouse comes inside, eats 1 or 2 peanuts and then leaves again every night
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just try to build a ladder up to the window and hope for the best
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I'm not fully convinced on the accumulation thing there. Also the brain they are concerned about. Not much substantial evidence so far tbh.
 Astrobytes: Why would the spike proteins be any different from any other proteins in the body?
 Astrobytes: They'll be gobbled up by the appropriate mechanisms, as all proteins are, whether native or not
 Astrobytes: *covid spike proteins
 Westicles: I don't know.  They keep putting up videos on papers about it, but they all get banned
 Westicles: Over here everything is banned that isn't 100% pro
 Astrobytes: That's because an awful lot of it is total bullcrap :DValid concerns shouldn't be banned, just addressed in the correct manner.
 Westicles: That japanese paper tracking where it goes in your body vs. time seemed legit
 500plus: 'A contribution by Bob' Loop task I dont even get the What to do in this Task
 Mohammed_Galal: hello Asrobytes
 Astrobytes: It doesn't particularly matter where it goes elsewhere in your body, it'll be consumed. 
 Astrobytes: Mostly accumulates in lymph nodes around the injection site iirc
 Astrobytes: Hello Mohammed_Galal
 Westicles: It was all bone marrow and ovaries
 Astrobytes: I saw one where they traced to the brain as well. I still see no cause for concern.
 Westicles: Not for me :P
 Astrobytes: Also, you realise bone marrow is where white blood cells are actually produced right?
 Westicles: Well, the guys in the video seem concerned.  It was that 'discoverer of mRNA' guy who gets in trouble everywhere
 Westicles: Anyhow, killing the chat...
 Astrobytes: I didn't see any evidence for neutropenia as a result of vax so I wouldn't worry about the bone marrow thing
 Astrobytes: Discoverer of mRNA? 
 Astrobytes: First observer or Crick et al?
 Astrobytes: But yeah, killing chat. Apologies all
 Mohammed_Galal: I'm backing often everyday to play new clashes
 Mohammed_Galal: Thanks God I'm improving in PHP
 Mohammed_Galal: ^_^
 Mohammed_Galal: btw how can I mention someone
 Astrobytes: Mohammed_Galal just type the username and it will appear red for  the user you mentioned
 Mohammed_Galal: Astrobytes

 eulerscheZahl: noooo!
 eulerscheZahl: MineDrops = MineDrops.Union(path.MineDrops).ToList();
 eulerscheZahl: i don't filter for distinct mines only. so when merging paths the mine list explodes
 eulerscheZahl: consequences: worse mine avoidance and timeouts
 metahom: hah. i got worse
 eulerscheZahl: what did you break?
 metahom: on sunday, I realized that I I do not update Torpedo Cooldown after launching it
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 metahom: so I launch torpedo and then change something else
 metahom: I was wondering why I lose close fights for a long time )))
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even track the cooldowns but manually replace the CHARGE action if i shoot a torpedo and move after
 eulerscheZahl: so at least you found it before the contest ended
 metahom: I'm pretty sure I have lot of stupid bugs left
 eulerscheZahl: that's like a law
 eulerscheZahl: having a buggy contest bot
 metahom: yep
 metahom: this time it was really hard to detect bugs. a few times I had feeling, that my self-tracking works bad. like enemy knows exactly where I am, while I think I have several possible positions. but didn't have time to check it
 eulerscheZahl: the best idea is to test against bots printing their detection
 eulerscheZahl: to see if you get the same numbers
 metahom: yea, that's a good idea. and I should thought of it before )))
 JFB:  It looks that in the rank, they are included point for OoC contest but not points from OcC multi. It is no OoC position in Rank/Bot programming" list.
 JFB: Is it bug or is it feature&#160;;-)&#160;? 
 metahom: points are included, but not shown on renking statistics popup
 metahom: until submit
 metahom: the same with UTG
 JFB: So I have to resubmit my bot? OK. Thanks&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: or tell CG to fix it
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - it can be "feature" that way. If sb do not resubmit his/her bot, but use automatically submited by CG, he/she will not have points. It looks fair
 eulerscheZahl: no
 JFB: why?
 eulerscheZahl: because one has a bot for the game
 dbdr: points appear to be there on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/leaderboard_xp.html</a>
 dbdr: where are they missing?
 eulerscheZahl: and especially if you don't even know that you have to resubmit to get points
 eulerscheZahl: on your profile summary dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: royale getting closer
 metahom: wait wait. points are included imo
 eulerscheZahl: they are
 dbdr: right, it's not in the list of multis
 dbdr: but it's counted in the general leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: but it's in this list at least <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 25 user ratings, that was fast
 eulerscheZahl: crystal rush has less
 dbdr: my profile About Me picture applies&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so you got a lot of sleep?
 eulerscheZahl: right, you were still there when i was already there yesterday morning
 dbdr: yes, 6:30 is much later than during the contest :D
 dbdr: I also went to sleep early
 kovi: #2
 eulerscheZahl: the next no-sleep-challenge is near
 dbdr: yes, that's so close
 dbdr: kovi what 2?
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 posted his own ranking btw <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-alternate-ranking/176074/2">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-alternate-ranking/176074/2</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd in multiplayer
 kovi: i c auto-submit on multi
 dbdr: oh interesting
 eulerscheZahl: "And finally comes YoBo, in a league of his own (sorry :sweat_smile:)"
 dbdr: I guess it's pb4 who did his alternative ranking in a previous contest too
 eulerscheZahl: he used a script he had from BR2K
 eulerscheZahl: but modified as this time he has no stats for each vs each
 dbdr: this is very interesting
 dbdr: but not a ranking
 dbdr: unless I'm missing something
 eulerscheZahl: it is a ranking
 eulerscheZahl: axis order has changed
 eulerscheZahl: not the leaderboard order
 dbdr: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: you can see "missing crosses" too
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. dolmen
 eulerscheZahl: he played against top but is bottom. so pb suggests that he's overrated
 dbdr: opening the image separately helps&#160;:)
 dbdr: too small otherwise
 reCurse: Ranking for ants
 dbdr: so MichaelPu was underrated
 dbdr: by CG compared to pb4
 kovi: i dont see why that ranking is better. im still not in top3
 dbdr: why didn't he give the ranking system?
 dbdr: competitive advantage in some way?
 reCurse: He sort of made his own
 dbdr: ok, but does not explain it
 dbdr: I know he says I should PM him&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: kovi you should make a ranking too then
 reCurse: Maybe he couldn't be bothered with giving details if no one is interested
 dbdr: right
 reCurse: Anyway I know the details, it's legit
 dbdr: overall it seems pretty consistent
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/BaxN9r7k">https://pastebin.com/BaxN9r7k</a>that's the data to start with
 dbdr: only a couple of clear differences among 60 people
 reCurse: Just not sure how much better it can be with missing matches though
 dbdr: and not even dramatic ones. top seems more or less identical
 eulerscheZahl: i was surprised by how well these ranking match
 reCurse: Well you do get pretty ideal conditions
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl you made a lot of stats right? did you PM about it? I did not read the forum yet
 reCurse: And trueskill isn't complete garbage either
 reCurse: When everyone plays against everyone around their ranks it helps a lot
 kovi: the interesting thing is what i conclude...that results (or multi state) with low number of games will never be good
 dbdr: :O
 reCurse: Rather than the submit orgy usually seen everywhere else
 eulerscheZahl: i shared a huge table dbdr
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: OK, ill ccheck
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885/8?u=eulerschezahl">https://forum.codingame.com/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885/8?u=eulerschezahl</a>
 dbdr: I made things like this:
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/535dcce3-d86f-46d3-97ba-8d78f41700a3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/535dcce3-d86f-46d3-97ba-8d78f41700a3</a>
 reCurse: So
 reCurse: It's a nice table
 reCurse: But did anyone gather any useful information from it
 reCurse: :popcorn:
 dbdr: mine reCurse?
 reCurse: Either
 eulerscheZahl: i learned that i took too much damage from mines
 eulerscheZahl: so i included a surface sometimes
 dbdr: it was not very hard to do. python is indeed nice for quick prototype, even though I barely used it before
 dbdr: and it was somewhat useful, yes
 kovi: i did from eulers
 kovi: silence patterns
 eulerscheZahl: and interesting to see that not all top players use the same strategy. there are differences in behaviour (silence vs mines for instance)
 dbdr: this is a summary, I have more detailed stats too
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f82fcea2-988c-4bcf-b9a4-d6200343081d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f82fcea2-988c-4bcf-b9a4-d6200343081d</a>
 reCurse: I'm just too lazy to read more into it and I didn't actually participate in the meta
 reCurse: So it's an opaque wall of pie charts to me
 reCurse: Much like most accounting presentations
 dbdr: and: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cd9f8fe0-5c44-4711-8568-87df47b9e585">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cd9f8fe0-5c44-4711-8568-87df47b9e585</a>
 dbdr: this was useful for me to see combinations that I do less or more (or not at all) compared to others
 reCurse: Interesting or useful?
 dbdr: starting point to think if they are clever or bad
 dbdr: both
 reCurse: As in did you actually use that data to improve your ai significantly
 dbdr: partly it was restful compared to the bot programming
 dbdr: I did use it
 reCurse: Ok
 reCurse: Cool
 eulerscheZahl: hard to tell if it was significant. but i improved too
 kovi: i just wonder why im in the multi at all?
 reCurse: New system
 dbdr: could I have found out the same insights in a different way? probably
 reCurse: They just copy/paste contest in multi now
 reCurse: Enjoy
 kovi: i c
 eulerscheZahl: pie charts might have been overkill :P
 dbdr: google sheets?
 reCurse: It's not overkill if you're looking for a promotion to excel dictator
 kovi: weird setup though. only 45 game and 80% vs. just 2 players
 eulerscheZahl: i hate Excel
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl wow, you generated HTML&#160;:)
 reCurse: Like a true 90s boy
 dbdr: did you share that during the contest?
 dbdr: I saw a  few individual pies only
 eulerscheZahl: small teasers, no full stat
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: even with avatars. definitely went overoard, I like it :D
 kovi: i like those kind of things, like mlombs stats for halite3
 dbdr: almost every player has crashes :D
 eulerscheZahl: all but 2
 dbdr: except joelthelion
 reCurse: That font though...
 eulerscheZahl: default font, didn't change it
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: -1
 eulerscheZahl: it's on github, make a PR
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl goes overboard with generating nice statsrecurse: the font could be nicer though
 reCurse: Well I'm a roi guy
 reCurse: It takes 5 seconds to make it look 10x nicer
 eulerscheZahl: 4
 eulerscheZahl: 3
 eulerscheZahl: 2
 eulerscheZahl: Wow, you're sending too many messages. Please, don't spam the chat.
 reCurse: Sheesh euler
 reCurse: Didn't know you were the spammer type
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl how many matches did you analyze?
 dbdr: 45322
 dbdr: sorry
 dbdr: I should read first
 reCurse: Sheesh dbdr
 reCurse: Didn't know you were the illiterate type
 kovi: ok, i definitely blame illedan and swagboy
 reCurse: I will always agree on that for illedan
 reCurse: That damn floating island
 kovi: illedan fell down too early and badly
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl I have "other" charge, not invalid
 dbdr: any idea what that is?
 eulerscheZahl: that's google charts
 eulerscheZahl: combining [invalid] to other as it's such a large group
 eulerscheZahl: (many items, small in size)
 dbdr: small you mean?
 reCurse: How many items can there be
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't read the docs
 reCurse: And who does
 eulerscheZahl: i also noticed that you should open the table in fullscreen to see the legend
 eulerscheZahl: and then reload
 reCurse: Mobile users screaming in the background
 dbdr: interesting how different pb4 and jolindien look
 eulerscheZahl: pb with more mines and less torpedoes
 eulerscheZahl: and games last much longer
 reCurse: I really think mines should explode with torpedoes
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: especially as they played a lot of games together
 reCurse: I only have a cursory understanding of physics but that seems legit
 dbdr: so game length difference is even bigger in theory
 eulerscheZahl: in RAIC you could explode mines by shooting them
 reCurse: Wait RAIC
 reCurse: That was a RAIC competition?
 eulerscheZahl: so players got as close as possible to the opponent and made a kamikaze move
 eulerscheZahl: the meta completely sucked
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off now, time for work
 reCurse: How would that even work
 eulerscheZahl: home office
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: you got points for dealing damage to the opponent
 reCurse: Oh you mean the platformer game
 eulerscheZahl: but no negative point sfor harming yourself
 pb4: Hi
 reCurse: I don't think it's quite comparable to this game
 eulerscheZahl: it isn't
 EdReynolds: Gah. Boss 4 is killing me &gt;.&lt;
 dbdr: hi pb4!how did you calculate your ranking?
 reCurse: I think it would have been interesting to damage the enemy with his own mines
 reCurse: Teach him to be so passive and boring
 pb4: I have the conversation since 7h29, not before... seemed interesting
 pb4: anybody could copy/paste&#160;?
 dbdr: pb4 I have the logs, will publish it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0353dca4-070c-4cd8-8ecc-6b7293aa1d39">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0353dca4-070c-4cd8-8ecc-6b7293aa1d39</a>
 reCurse: It's 1:46 am here so you're from the future
 pb4: as for timeouts, I should be counted in the "non-timeout bots"
 reCurse: You tell me
 dbdr: ok, eulerscheZahl did the job
 eulerscheZahl: starting with ceg not tracking torpedo shootings as he didn't know that the location was given on the input
 pb4: my timeouts are when I have nowhere to go, 1 left left, and no mine to trigger to make a "dummy" action
 pb4: so... would lose anyway
 pb4: didn't bother to ouptut something valid&#160;:)
 dbdr: I thought it's better not to timeout then
 dbdr: easier to spot real bugs
 reCurse: SURFACE? :P
 pb4: KILLSELF
 pb4:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: try { action() }catch(..) SURFACE
 dbdr: RESPAWN
 dbdr: what was  the BttC command?
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: that feature was added maybe 24 hours before the end
 eulerscheZahl: respawn, why didn't we think of that?
 pb4: I had already debugged everything I would debug from the bot
 dbdr: what feature?
 pb4: the infinite trigger if I can't do anything else
 dbdr: right. but you never know
 dbdr: ah ok
 pb4: so it wasn't really a matter if bugs were mixed up in those timeouts
 pb4: I wasn't going to correct them anyway
 kovi: i even added last shoot in the dark
 pb4: thanks eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 dbdr: kovi lol
 dbdr: I thought about it
 eulerscheZahl: oh, some of the crashes i linked are already offline again&#160;:(
 dbdr: did you ever see it working kovi?
 kovi: and ofc at last turn 2nd player a provisional fatality attack
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: give a score X_i to each player
 kovi: last shoot....0 chance of succedd
 pb4: assume the matchup between two players should end up in X_i / (X_i + X_j)  winrate
 dbdr: not 0
 kovi: 298 turn 2nd player....rare
 dbdr: ah, last turn of the game
 pb4: optimize for all X_i so that the expected winrates matches the observed winrates as close as possible
 dbdr: I thought before dying from surface
 dbdr: right, that's the general principle
 reCurse: Gradient descent?
 dbdr: I think others use sth else than xi / xi + xj
 pb4: reCurse&#160;: the tool for optimization&#160;?
 reCurse: Yeah
 dbdr: something more gaussian
 pb4: scipy.optimize with Newton-CG solver
 kovi: dbdr - not when dieing from surface: because that means you cant move, so you cant use finisher combos
 dbdr: 1 vs 99 does not have a 1% change of win, but rather 0.001%
 dbdr: I think
 reCurse: His X_i is not like elo or trueskill
 reCurse: I made the same mistake
 reCurse: You'd need to log them to get something equivalent
 dbdr: ah, makes sense
 dbdr: they will grow much more
 dbdr: right, intuitively seems like you can model the same distribution of strengths
 dbdr: this kind of system is robust to match order, it's irrelevant
 dbdr: definitely superior for ranking
 dbdr: given a set of matches
 reCurse: It has the disadvantage of not really being online and super expensive
 dbdr: right
 reCurse: Also I don't know how much weight we can give to winrates
 dbdr: different tradeoff
 reCurse: With such low numbers
 reCurse: But still
 pb4: reCurse&#160;: that would be an interesting question
 reCurse: You'd need to incorporate variance somehow
 reCurse: Don't ask me how
 dbdr: TS for online + this afterwards gives sth better than TS, I think
 reCurse: You're just reinforcing bias
 pb4: use the X_i to generate new data with the as many replays, re-apply the calculation and check whether the ranking has changed a lot
 dbdr: how?
 pb4: do that a lot, and evaluate variance
 kovi: but will it be stable?
 pb4: btw, I had do this exact analysis for TS + rerun procedure :o)
 pb4: kovi&#160;: just don't update the underlying X_i from one run to the other
 reCurse: I think the optimizer would need the variance from the number of matches
 pb4: use the X_i calculated from the first run to generate many different random runs from the same underlying distribution
 dbdr: yeah, don't learn from made up data :D
 reCurse: And change the weight on that error accordingly
 reCurse: Like it should care less about matching something expected if it has 10x less matches
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: why can't you learn something on the method&#160;?
 reCurse: If you can put weight on each error that might be a better way to do it
 dbdr: I mean if you generate fake results to measure variance
 reCurse: Less expensive too
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/propositions-to-replace-bo5-final-contest-rerun/2851/8?u=pb4">https://forum.codingame.com/t/propositions-to-replace-bo5-final-contest-rerun/2851/8?u=pb4</a>
 dbdr: ah, that's the one I remembered&#160;:)
 reCurse: Hmm actually
 reCurse: I wonder if the big upsets from your method
 reCurse: Are coming directly from lower quality winrate due to lower sampling
 reCurse: They're all assumed to be equal right now?
 reCurse: Past a threshold?
 pb4: nope
 pb4: Is your question when looking for the biggest upsets or during optimization&#160;?
 reCurse: Optimization
 pb4: In any case, the answer is no :o)
 reCurse: How do you feed it the winrate quality
 dbdr: well, during optimization each match can contribute as much to the MSE, right?
 pb4: let N_1_2 be the number of wins of player 1 against player 2
 pb4: I want to maximize the function&#160;:
 dbdr: so if there are few matches between two players,  the optimization will not try that hard to explain the results. seems to be low sampling will not create artifacts
 pb4: (X1 / (X1 + X2))**N_1_2 * (X2 / (X1 + X2))**N_2_1 
 reCurse: Ah that's an interesting detail
 pb4: this is if there are only 2 players, but you can just multiply for all pairs of players
 dbdr: it tries to minimize error on all matches, not on all pairs of players
 reCurse: Well it's minimizing on pairs there
 pb4: Yes
 dbdr: where?
 reCurse: X1 and X2
 reCurse: That's a pair not a match
 pb4: reCurse it can be rewritten by match
 dbdr: oh, that looks wrong to me
 dbdr: by match would be better I think
 pb4: ok
 pb4: let's write it by match
 reCurse: I don't see why
 reCurse: It's better
 pb4: there are two matches 
 pb4: a win from i on j
 dbdr: for the reason you gave reCurse :D
 pb4: and win from k on l
 reCurse: That's why you apply a weighting to it
 reCurse: Like he does
 dbdr: if you have only one match against two players, doing by player will give it a lot of weight
 reCurse: Don't quite grasp the effect yet though
 dbdr: adding noise
 pb4: (Xi / (Xi+Xj)) * (Xk / (Xk+Xl))
 dbdr: minimizing by match sounds more stable to me
 pb4: must be maximized over Xijkl
 pb4: right&#160;?
 dbdr: but might have other artifacts, hm
 pb4: The formula is extended if you have more matches, just multiply by the X / X+X value for each individual match
 reCurse: Wouldn't that be much more computation heavy
 dbdr: I think we need to write a simulation :D
 pb4: If player i won N_ij games against player j
 pb4: you'll have N_ij times the same term in the formula
 dbdr: generate player strenghts, sample results, then check how well different methods find the real player strengths
 pb4: so that's&#160;:
 pb4: (Xi / (Xi +Xj) )**N_ij
 dbdr: use TS to generate matches for added relevance
 reCurse: Generating player strength is the perfect way to waste your time
 dbdr:&#160;?
 dbdr: rand
 reCurse: The real problem is dealing with noise and intransitivity
 dbdr: this is just a way to validate your system
 dbdr: you create noise by sampling
 dbdr: and verify how your system is able to cancel it
 reCurse: It's too artificial
 reCurse: I like your explanation for the power term pb4
 reCurse: Makes sense I think
 dbdr: better than trying to argue which method is better in the abstract
 reCurse: Is it though
 reCurse: Because almost all ranking systems I've seen fall apart when it comes to real world implementation
 dbdr: "validation is useful"
 reCurse: They all have nice proofs and perform well in artificial settings though
 dbdr: they have proofs with clear objective and conditions
 dbdr: if the conditions don't apply, indeed they will fail
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: e.g. use TS for offline ranking
 dbdr: obviosuly suboptimal
 reCurse: It's not though
 dbdr: TS is optimal now?
 reCurse: If you give it enough data and uniform sampling yeah it's gonna be pretty close
 dbdr: it will give more weight to the last match than the first
 dbdr: for no good reason
 reCurse: That's not entirely true
 reCurse: Mostly wrong even
 dbdr: explain
 reCurse: The last match actually influences a lot less than the first
 reCurse: The only way it eventually may matter more is because of the dynamics factor added
 reCurse: But with tau = 0 it's actually stable
 dbdr: sure,  but do they use tau = 0?
 reCurse: Who the hell knows
 dbdr: :D
 reCurse: I'm talking about real ts
 reCurse: Don't care about CG since I don't know what they're doing
 dbdr: real TS has parameters
 reCurse: With tau = 0 it's actually very stable
 dbdr: so yes, need to specify which ones you use
 reCurse: That's what the parameter is for
 dbdr: right. I still think other methods are better for offline ranking
 reCurse: Except you're still going to be biased by matchmaking
 reCurse: And you won't have the resources necessary to compute your offline ranking every time you matchmake
 dbdr: right, that's the tradeoff
 reCurse: So if you're biased by that
 reCurse: It's debatable whether you correct that bias with offline method
 dbdr: could be used for the recalc for instance
 dbdr: baically, take the recalc that TS did and minimize the error on that
 dbdr: should be better by construction
 reCurse: But it's basing itself off the very same data
 reCurse: That's what I'm trying to explain
 dbdr: yes, making better use of the same data
 dbdr: I know, generating the best data is another problem
 reCurse: For all you know you're not correcting the error of TS
 reCurse: But the error of CG
 reCurse: I think it's much more likely actually
 dbdr: CG = TS with some specific parameters and a certain matchmaking
 dbdr: do we agreee on that?
 reCurse: No
 dbdr: how does it differ?
 reCurse: Because you'll use that equivalent to argue about TS
 reCurse: When you're actually arguing about CG's
 reCurse: I'm arguing that a proper usage of TS would have corrected the same error
 dbdr: that's not a valid argument
 dbdr: it's not true because if it is A will happen&#160;:)
 reCurse: A?
 dbdr: whatever
 dbdr: I mean the reasoning
 dbdr: why is it not true? what else does CG do?
 dbdr: apart apply TS with certain parameters and matchmake?
 reCurse: It is impossible to evaluate without access to their implementation
 dbdr: right
 reCurse: So it's a waste of time trying to use CG as a fair representation of TS
 dbdr: so I'm saying I suppose this is what CG does, and it's based on what we know
 reCurse: And if it's configured incorrectly
 dbdr: I don't plan to do that
 reCurse: Then we're still wasting our time
 reCurse: If they left tau &gt; 0
 reCurse: That's not a fair representation of TS
 reCurse: You're blaming it for something its parameter is meant to do
 reCurse: That's literally what it's there for, to give more weight to recent performance
 reCurse: Assuming humans can change skill over time
 dbdr: the thing is tau might be useful if the meta changes, no?
 reCurse: Which doesn't apply for static bots
 reCurse: We're talking about rerun
 reCurse: Nothing changes anymore
 dbdr: I think even with tau = 0, match order matters
 reCurse: No it doesnt
 dbdr: because TS is online
 reCurse: The only exception is it matters for matchmaking
 reCurse: But with same data it won't matter
 dbdr: it looks at the first match without looking at any other
 dbdr: then never looks at it again
 reCurse: That's not how it works&#160;:/
 dbdr: no? I might be wrong then&#160;:)
 reCurse: It's cumulating data to zero in on a guess
 dbdr: but then how is it online?
 dbdr: accumulating is not the same as keeping the whole data
 dbdr: it's keeping an abstraction of it
 reCurse: With enough data
 reCurse: And with uniform sampling
 reCurse: Match order ceases to matter significantly
 reCurse: And with tau = 0
 dbdr: that's handwaving&#160;:)
 reCurse: Alright I'm done
 dbdr: yes, it can get close
 reCurse: Off to bed, night&#160;:)
 dbdr: possibly
 dbdr: gn&#160;:)

 Imsure1200q: How do you save code in challenges? I can't remember.
 Uljahn: by clicking the play button
 Uljahn: or submit to be sure, so your code appears on the history tab
 DiL: hi, does anyone knows if it's possible to keep chat minimized while writing code?
 Re9iNee: it has a minimize button 
 Re9iNee: the buttom left button
 Re9iNee: Hi, im still working on Ocean Of Code, will it be available again?
 Re9iNee: or am i just wasting my time?
 wlesavo: Re9iNee already is
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ocean-of-code</a>
 DiL: ok got it thanks but I have to minimize it every time, I guess it's not possible to automatically hide chat when starting a clash
 Re9iNee: oh, thanks
 CacheCoherence: how do i not allow cursor to move in clash of code during compiling(when getting an error)?
 DiL: CacheCoherenct no idea, I also have an issue with this UI since somtimes focus moves to chat while I'm writing code :confused:
 Re9iNee: i didnt encounter this problem
 Re9iNee: but just crossed my mind that can you write an event for it? 
 Re9iNee: event.preventDefault()
 RoboStac: you can bookmark <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/home?disableChat=True">https://www.codingame.com/home?disableChat=True</a> to have a link that doesn't show chat
 DiL: RoboStac :thumbsup: thanks man
 CacheCoherence: I keep the chat closed. But when im running a test case, the cursor goes to the error point (if there is any)
 CacheCoherence: Thats annoying
 tutubalin: Guys, probably i found a bug<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/FjUrHMi">https://imgur.com/a/FjUrHMi</a>
 Nerchio: whats the bug :p
 wlesavo: Nerchio no score
 WINWINWIN: Guys, if anyone has encountered this error in python3, please advise
 WINWINWIN: I am starting a GA in CSB and I am using a move object to hold move details
 WINWINWIN: When I try move.angle, I get the error "Nonetype does not have attribute angle"
 WINWINWIN: but on printing, the error happens and the angle gets printed
 WINWINWIN: I attempted a hasattr function which also yields true
 Uljahn: i doubt anyone can debug your code besides you
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:(
 Uljahn: do you try move.angle as a method?
 Uljahn: it's hard to guess without a code snippet
 RoboStac: the errors saying that move is None so it doesn't have any attributes - are you sure it exists when you try to use it?
 WINWINWIN: move.angle is simply an attribute
 WINWINWIN: can I share a code snippet?
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/YTtD68rD">https://pastebin.com/YTtD68rD</a>
 IAmNoob: hi!
 IAmNoob: hi!
 abhay_RAJ: print()
 shatts_: has anyone done the music scores one?
 tutubalin: WINWINWIN movement parameter is None
 tutubalin: o, wait
 tutubalin: move is method
 tutubalin: of course there's no angle attribute
 tutubalin: i assume you've got into name conflict: you use 'move' both for method and variable
 struct: Snef online?
 LordZedd: konichuva
 AntiSquid: get an anime avatar!
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 AntiSquid: actually i am trying out some korean extra spicy noodle soup and it's a bit too much even for me ...
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: ah nice, that sounds like my kinda noodle soup
 AntiSquid: it makes me cough too&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Keep eating it, it'll build up your chilli tolerance
 AntiSquid: i have high tollerance, but this is above the usual
 AntiSquid: have you tried the iceland extra firey chilli pizza? i could only taste the chillies on it althout it has chicken pieces too
 AntiSquid: altough *
 Astrobytes: Which soup is it? Well, that counts me out of eating that pizza lol
 AntiSquid: well it says ramen, i call it soup because i diluted it a lot&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XDSHBJM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06XDSHBJM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>
 Astrobytes: Nice! It does say "Extremely hot and spicy"&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Suitable for vegetarians too, might have to try these at some point
 AntiSquid: will use just half the sachet next time
 Astrobytes: You never can tell until you've tried 'em, half the time "extremely hot" means it tingles your tongue, it's a pleasant surprise when you get the real deal
 AntiSquid: that's why i cook my own food
 AntiSquid: usually
 Astrobytes: Same. But I like to keep snacks handy since I don't do takeaway stuff
 AntiSquid: i used to order from cheap asian shops
 AntiSquid: but quality went down after a while
 arnau: Jack Silver - The Casino I PAY WELL FOR THE SOLUTION Xd
 Uljahn: just buy 29+ lvl account xD
 arnau: no no it os a program 
 arnau: *is
 AntiSquid: arnau i can sell you level 30+ account, so don't buy from Uljahn
 Uljahn: :rage:
 AntiSquid: i also ask half of whatever Uljahn is asking
 eulerscheZahl: i can sell links to build your own lvl29+ account
 Nerchio: floyd warshal broke my mind&#160;:(
 arnau: i only want the slution xD
 Astrobytes: Just go to codingamesolutions.com and fill out the 12 surveys plus your credit card details and I'll send the solution
 WINWINWIN: Or u could sell you lvl 50+ acc euler xD
 eulerscheZahl: did you read some post mortems for GitC?
 Nerchio: no
 Nerchio: i will do it later
 eulerscheZahl: because we discuss flody warshall there too
 Nerchio: but i just realised that path through some nodes is faster than direct so to speak
 AntiSquid: WTB cheap level 51+ account, PM me, no trolls please, thanks
 AntiSquid: (WTB = want to buy, rpg lingo)
 Nerchio: i just copied java floyd warshal and will try to understand it after i make it work
 Nerchio: im close ;p
 Nerchio: but took a long time
 eulerscheZahl: 4 lines, not much to understand
 Uljahn: from scipy.sparse.csgraph import floyd_warshall :relieved:
 eulerscheZahl: if path from a via b to c is shorter than a to c directly, update it
 Nerchio: yeah sounds easy but i will have to look at it step by step :p
 Nerchio: and i needed to do some data transformations
 Nerchio: because it works on arrays and i had a list
 eulerscheZahl: and no operator overloading
 eulerscheZahl: have fun with list.get(index)
 Nerchio: hehe yea&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: why java
 Nerchio: i have 3 hashmaps already
 Nerchio: for nodes lol
 AntiSquid: you said they teach you c and ocaml
 Nerchio: direct connections
 AntiSquid: you can have nodes in any language
 Nerchio: shortest path to each node from this one
 eulerscheZahl: even in node.js?
 AntiSquid: even in js 
 Nerchio: im not touching C in anything outside of school
 AntiSquid: why
 Astrobytes: Why?
 AntiSquid: wow
 Nerchio: i dont like pointers
 Neon_Tuts: Hello World
 AntiSquid: how is java not worse than C&#160;?
 Nerchio: i like understandable more than magic
 eulerscheZahl: C is the opposite from magic
 Astrobytes: If you take the time to understand C it's more understandable than Java
 eulerscheZahl: when you want to make a fire in java, you can take the lighter or the flame thrower
 eulerscheZahl: in C you have to take flintstones
 Astrobytes: Well, you need to create your own flintstone structures first&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i always hated strings in C
 Nerchio: yeah thats annoying
 Nerchio: strings in C xD
 Astrobytes: Not great fun, admittedly
 AntiSquid: wow i actually managed to eat all that
 Astrobytes: Well done!
 AntiSquid: runy nose 
 AntiSquid: anyone knows the top algorithms for bandas?
 Astrobytes: Last I knew it was MCTS or alphabeta
 RoboStac: alphazero works well too
 Astrobytes: Oh you have that on bandas too? Didn't know that
 AntiSquid: hah thanks was wonder about that
 AntiSquid: what do you use? 64 inputs each round?
 RoboStac: 192 inputs (64 for me /them / board)
 RoboStac: with the board always being shifted so the gaps are on the right / bottom
 AntiSquid: why is it necessary to split it up this way? why 64 for the board?
 RoboStac: it needs to know which squares are empty vs which squares are removed
 cegprakash: my torpedo is giving away my position to enemy quickly
 cegprakash: how do I avoid that in SIlver league
 ZarthaxX: what i told you&#160;:)
 cegprakash: yes
 AntiSquid: fire less torpedoes, use more mines?
 cegprakash: I just added that myself
 cegprakash: AntiSquid oh
 cegprakash: when should I decide not to fire torpedo? my eval automatically shoots blind spots
 ZarthaxX: shoot when it's really worth
 cegprakash: because I decrease enemy life for random shooting in his possibility
 AntiSquid: hey read my PM&#160;! ceg :p
 ZarthaxX: like hitting the 70% of possible spots
 cegprakash: oh
 AntiSquid: it's free of charge on first 10 views
 cegprakash: I can try this 70% thingy
 cegprakash: what is free of charge
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: I'll read urs
 ZarthaxX: also u should check if after you shoot you reveal yourself too much and chain that action with a silence
 ZarthaxX: just to dont give opp advantage to shoot you for 2 hp
 cegprakash: Yeah I plan to track myself for that
 cegprakash: but not very soon
 cegprakash: I self tracking needed in Silver?
 cegprakash: I thought I can reach Gold without self tracking
 wlesavo: the earlier you implement it less pain you will have later i guess
 cegprakash: I have this bug where enemy does self damage to himself
 cegprakash: and I shoot on the same turn
 cegprakash: I think he is near me
 cegprakash: and he got damaged because of me
 MSmits: create a damage map
 MSmits: record all damage and the cells it was dealt to
 MSmits: all the cells that have the same damage as the opponent life lost, are places he can be at
 MSmits: do all forms of damage though
 cegprakash: oh no I can't even think of mine damage tracking with my current code
 Swagboy: He don't forget that he may surface&#160;;)
 cegprakash: I'm only focusing short term goals of reaching gold
 cegprakash: without mines
 MSmits: you dont need to track mines for this though
 MSmits: you know where a mine blew up just from reading opponent orders
 MSmits: thats without tracking any mines
 cegprakash: Swagboy I track surface already
 cegprakash: tracking surface is ez
 eulerscheZahl: surface makes it impossible to remove some paths resulting on the same cell to reduce possible mine locations
 Swagboy: I mean in the damage map
 LUKAKU27: someone have Don't Panic -1 in c#?
 Swagboy: Don't mix his surface and your torpedo touching
 AntiSquid: -1&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: episode 1
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid has it
 AntiSquid: he clearly said negative 1
 LUKAKU27: eoisode 1*
 LUKAKU27: episode*
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits
 MSmits: with onitama, is the input for the middle card given for player 0 or 1
 MSmits: the orientation
 eulerscheZahl: for the player playing it next
 eulerscheZahl: that means for you
 MSmits: but i cant play it nexrt
 MSmits: its in the middle
 eulerscheZahl: you are the next player to hold it
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: k got it thanks
 MSmits: this orientation stuff is really the hardest bit to simulate
 eulerscheZahl: and every card is given the way as the next player will use it
 eulerscheZahl: it was a pain to design
 MSmits: yeah it's no criticism btw, you did it fine, it's just not easy to simulate
 eulerscheZahl: i confused myself multiple times and even swapped x and y at some point
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't understand it as critisism
 eulerscheZahl: just casual chatting
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: doesnt help that I am trying to cram the whole gamestate in 1 64 bit int :P
 MSmits: believe it or not, you can do that
 MSmits: this game actually has very few gamestates, worst case it's 1000 billion or so
 MSmits: makes every game solvable, just not in 1000 ms
 eulerscheZahl: you have to distinguish between 8 players+2masters of different teamsand 5 cards
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: and yet it is possible
 MSmits: 25 bit for each series of positions
 MSmits: total 50 bit
 MSmits: 3 bit to identify which of the 5 bits on your side is a master
 MSmits: total 56 bit
 MSmits: 1 bit for whose turn it is
 MSmits: 57 bit
 MSmits: then 5 bit for the cardstates
 MSmits: there are 30 cardstates, so fits in 5 bit
 MSmits: 2 left
 eulerscheZahl: but does it allow fast access to what you need?
 eulerscheZahl: what's the point in tiny board state but slow access?
 MSmits: pretty fast, but I am not sure if the penalty is worth it. I need to pext/pdep for masters is all
 MSmits: the thing is
 MSmits: because this game has so few gamestates, transpositions may be worth it
 MSmits: transpositions require hashing
 MSmits: 64 bit hash key is a miracle for that
 eulerscheZahl: and you already have that with such small states
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: no need for collision checks
 eulerscheZahl: but still sounds crazy to me
 MSmits: exactly, but again, this might be premature again. Not the first time I made that mistake
 MSmits: maybe transpositions are worthless
 MSmits: do you see many repeated states?
 eulerscheZahl: and you'll never learn from it
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: bitboards are part of the fun for you
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know how many repetitions i see
 eulerscheZahl: then again my depth isn't that high
 eulerscheZahl: check karlis o, he prints the depth
 MSmits: it just seems like with such a small board and identical pieces, you would see some
 ZarthaxX: no need for collision check?
 ZarthaxX: hash can still collide :thinking:
 MSmits: no, because the 64 bit key is unique
 MSmits: unless it collides with itself?
 MSmits: not sure what happens under the hood
 ZarthaxX: are u using a fixed array hash tabkle
 ZarthaxX: or like std
 MSmits: no the game state is just a 64 bit int, the full state
 eulerscheZahl: you missed half of the chat and jumped in right now, didn't you?
 ZarthaxX: im reading
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: in oware i also have the full state in 1 64 bit int
 ZarthaxX: half right toad
 MSmits: but i dont use transpositions there
 ZarthaxX: thought u meant collision check in a hash table
 MSmits: nah, the idea is to use unordered map
 ZarthaxX: ah...
 ZarthaxX: do u always use that?
 MSmits: sometimes i use set
 MSmits: depends
 MSmits: unordered set
 MSmits: that is
 ZarthaxX: u never use your own hash table?
 MSmits: well you can do custom hashers and equal functions
 MSmits: so thats sort of my own then isnt it?
 ZarthaxX: i meant the datastructure
 ZarthaxX: not that
 MSmits: nope, never done that
 ZarthaxX: aight
 MSmits: do you have examples/resources?
 MSmits: might be interesting to me
 ZarthaxX: i mean.. i can tell u stuff
 MSmits: sure
 ZarthaxX: u might find interesting how they manage it on chess bot
 MSmits: i probably do
 MSmits: thats almos tthe same thing i have to manage in most bots if i want to do transpositions
 ZarthaxX: but basically an array where u might or not have a list in each
 ZarthaxX: to manage collisions
 MSmits: an array per cell?
 MSmits: or something?
 ZarthaxX: there is a way to design a hash table that wont work here which is if u collide in a spot, check next spot that is given by a function
 ZarthaxX: lemme just find these concepts
 MSmits: cool
 ZarthaxX: wikipedia condenses all these concepts anyway
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_probing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_probing</a>

 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing</a>
 ZarthaxX: different wayts to leads with collision when u have a table that stores 1 element per cell
 ZarthaxX: and a collision is produced 
 ZarthaxX: i dont think that's worth here
 cegprakash: just found a cool bug where my tracking will say opponent is nowhere in the map when I'm 2nd player
 arnau: i need help with JACK SILVER: THE CASINO in c#
 MSmits: ah... well it should not be worth it at all in onitama, because when two keys are equal the state is equal, guaranteed. I was more thinking about bigger games, like yvalath, bandas etc.
 ZarthaxX: and this was the other option u have, you store elements in a linked list in each cell
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining</a>
 ZarthaxX: u might as well replace the list with a fixed array so u keep best 3 maybe
 ZarthaxX: in each cell
 MSmits: did you use this stuff before ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: i didnt use the linear qudratic stuff,  just showed it so you saw it,
 ZarthaxX: not worth 
 ZarthaxX: but the other thing of array with a list i did
 MSmits: ah double hashing, sounds smart
 ZarthaxX: chess bot does the same too
 ZarthaxX: it's really interesting to read the different tables it has
 ZarthaxX: also how you discard an element when your cell bucket is full
 MSmits: yeah. Thankfully most cg games aren't as complicated as chess
 MSmits: so many different move types
 ZarthaxX: right, but u can get ideas of how they model stuff
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I always get referred to chess sites when i look up stuff, especially minimax style things
 MSmits: if you get to transpositions, you always find chess sites
 ZarthaxX: look at the TT of stockfish
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/tt.h">https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/src/tt.h</a>
 ZarthaxX: lol right :P
 ZarthaxX: he has a TT with clusters of TTEntry
 ZarthaxX: the same thing i said ebfore basically
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: ok thanks, I will remember next time I need a more complicated transposition table
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: anyway i tried this for breakthrough, tho i suspect as stockfish has more time to think
 ZarthaxX: maybe it's more worth it
 ZarthaxX: it's difficult here where u dont have many ms
 MSmits: isnt a breakthrough has just two 64 bit boards xored together?
 MSmits: xorshifted i mean
 MSmits: doesnt seem much else to it
 ZarthaxX: yeah but 
 ZarthaxX: it's not about the keys
 MSmits: thats what i do for Yavalath
 MSmits: oh?
 ZarthaxX: it's about making a table that is faster than a map or set
 ZarthaxX: to access
 MSmits: ah ok, got it
 ZarthaxX: or insert
 ZarthaxX: as sets and maps are implemented with RB trees
 MSmits: RB?
 ZarthaxX: the fact that they are freeing and requesting memory
 ZarthaxX: might affect your perf
 ZarthaxX: but the array doesnt do that so its worth trying
 cegprakash: ZarthaxX I added the 70% thingy
 ZarthaxX: tho the set map might not lose info as this does
 MSmits: hmm there is a different between unordered and ordered map though
 ZarthaxX: red black tree
 MSmits: orderedmap preserves some kind of ordering, it is slower in many cases
 ZarthaxX: ah unordered srry, hash table there as i read
 ZarthaxX: preserving order requires a tree
 MSmits: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: so that needs new and delete
 MSmits: but you're saying I could also improve on an unordered map with my own hash table?
 ZarthaxX: maybe, maybe not
 ZarthaxX: u can try
 MSmits: worth investigating
 ZarthaxX: it's not much code to try
 MSmits: well code isnt the problem
 ZarthaxX: i never used set and map
 ZarthaxX: unordered i mean
 ZarthaxX: okey :P
 MSmits: it's mostly reading the resources and understanding how it all works&#160;:)
 MSmits: knowing what you're doing
 ZarthaxX: there's not much around that
 ZarthaxX: hash tables arepretty  easy to get
 ZarthaxX: trees variations not so much
 MSmits: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: trees require u to understand what to do after inserting / deleting elements
 ZarthaxX: like how to maintain that data structure
 MSmits: I see
 ZarthaxX: so it preserves the properties that are worth
 MSmits: and set and map use a tree?
 ZarthaxX: that's a headache
 MSmits: and unordered doesnt&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: yeah red black tree
 ZarthaxX: it says it uses a hash table apparently
 MSmits: k
 MSmits: I've always used unordered, because every time I google it says its faster for what i want
 MSmits: I guess thats because of what you say
 MSmits: the tree maintaining
 ZarthaxX: yes, anyway
 cegprakash: wow it looks like a great submit
 ZarthaxX: libraries are open osource
 MSmits: yea
 ZarthaxX: u can dive into the classes and check what's going on
 ZarthaxX: cegprakash did the 70 worked?
 MSmits: I can, but I am like my students. 
 MSmits: When I tell them to read, they will ask me to just tell them what it says :P
 cegprakash: yes and I reduced the enemy silence jump distance from 4 to 1
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-vs-unordered_set-c-stl/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-vs-unordered_set-c-stl/</a> MSmits
 ZarthaxX: yeah i know lazy lol
 ZarthaxX: cegprakash gud
 MSmits: We need to keep a set of distinct elements and no ordering is required.We need single element access i.e. no traversal.
 cegprakash: I only  lose against mines now
 cegprakash: I need to start tracking mines
 MSmits: thats always what i need
 ZarthaxX: yeah but look at the search time
 ZarthaxX: and insertion
 ZarthaxX: and deletion 
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: i mean, if you could do a variation of that , doing it O(1) and sacrificing the accuracy, like more miss than hit
 MSmits: search time is a bit hard to guess from that
 MSmits: worst case is n
 ZarthaxX: yeah i know
 ZarthaxX: but if the table starts to populate
 ZarthaxX: it may be a problem
 ZarthaxX: also resizing
 WINWINWIN: Lol I thought that people would have had enough of OoC by now&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: when table doesnt have any more space needs to resize
 MSmits: can you initialize it with a huge space?
 MSmits: or will that make it slow from the start?
 MSmits: like you can give arrays a huge capacity just in case
 MSmits: object pools etc.
 K4Mx: i dont understand simple synhtax issue on clojure and also how to compare == simple java.lang.long, it gives null pointer exc
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/reserve/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/reserve/</a>
 ZarthaxX: like vector reserve i guess
 MSmits: I might need that
 MSmits: but i wonder
 MSmits: if i make 100 mb of room for this unordered map
 MSmits: wont I get problems with memory caching?
 MSmits: because its gonna have buckets all over the place
 MSmits: bucket mania
 ZarthaxX: i mean yeah if you try storing in 2 opposite sides
 ZarthaxX: it might..
 MSmits: I am not  *trying*, the hash function will do that, wont it?
 MSmits: if it is given the room
 MSmits: or will it keep the data close together?
 ZarthaxX: what
 ZarthaxX: i know you are not trying
 ZarthaxX: i meant the code lol
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i mean the implementation
 ZarthaxX: it wont keep data together
 ZarthaxX: the hash function does the job
 ZarthaxX: but look for example at what happens
 MSmits: yeah so i get memory caching issues
 ZarthaxX: when u insert an element and the table is getting kind of "full"
 ZarthaxX: A rehash is the reconstruction of the hash table: All the elements in the container are rearranged according to their hash value into the new set of buckets. This may alter the order of iteration of elements within the container.
 ZarthaxX: a rehash happens
 Astrobytes: I think you'd need to write a custom allocator for that
 ZarthaxX: that might be a problem too
 ZarthaxX: it wont happen often anyway
 ZarthaxX: but still
 MSmits: yeah, so basically what you do is you estimate how big your unordered map is going to be and give it that size from the start&#160;?
 Astrobytes: (re. keeping the memory contiguous)
 MSmits: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: MSmits yeah but..... if u exceed that..
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes its a hash table, its always continous
 MSmits: then it rehashes
 ZarthaxX: unless u implement it weirdly
 ZarthaxX: chunks of data
 ZarthaxX: of memory i mean
 MSmits: I'm gonna have to read more on this and experiment
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX I misread :P
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: hi astrobyto
 ZarthaxX: MSmits gl :P
 ZarthaxX: it's not too complex
 MSmits: thanks
 ZarthaxX: you can explore the unordered set anyway <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/</a>
 ZarthaxX: it tells what happens on each operation
 MSmits: not down to what happens with memory does it?
 MSmits: i just wonder what happens if say, I insert an integer in an integer set. What happens if i inset 4 and then 34560. Are they going to be close togehter in memory? Or far apart? Is this related to the capacity that is set? 
 darkstar: hi everyone&#160;:) how are you all today?
 MSmits: i know there's a hash function that is applied to it
 MSmits: but that doesnt tell me where the allocator is going to put it in memory
 MSmits: hi darkstar
 Astrobytes: In that case, maybe you do need a custom allocator
 MSmits: well not sure, I don't even know how it normally works
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator</a>
 MSmits: memory caching effects are a very real thing
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map</a>
 MSmits: in bots
 MSmits: yeah i saw that, but i dont see much at first glance. Doesnt tell me how it works. Might be me though
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdallocator-in-cpp-with-examples/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdallocator-in-cpp-with-examples/</a>
 Astrobytes: "All the STL containers in C++ have a type parameter Allocator that is by default std::allocator. The default allocator simply uses the operators new and delete to obtain and release memory."
 MSmits: ok, but the location of the memory is still not visible
 MSmits: it's going "somewhere" 
 Astrobytes: Yes, hence writing your own allocator
 eulerscheZahl: is it me or is there something wrong with github right now?
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. no access to repos
 Astrobytes: I can't even access it rn
 eulerscheZahl: great, then it's fine on my side&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 504 gateway timeout
 MSmits: Whoops, something went wrong!We track these errors automatically, but if the problem persists feel free to contact us.
 darkstar: github seems ok for me
 Astrobytes: getting github error 500
 eulerscheZahl: some of my requests seem to pass, others timeout
 darkstar: yeah ok, my bad, same here
 darkstar: luck of the draw
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm alternating between 504 and 500
 darkstar: at least you get a nice unicorn 
 eulerscheZahl: the first time i want to try tech.io and then this happens (to create a playground, you have to push you stuff on github and they pull it)
 MSmits: you never made a playground before?
 MSmits: that surprises me
 eulerscheZahl: what about?
 ZarthaxX: MSmits u cant really know where the element is landing
 eulerscheZahl: i guess some microsoft devs are sweating right now
 Astrobytes: MSmits, so if you want to control where your memory is being allocated/whether constructors are called etc then you can do that in the allocator
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Astrobytes: But it seems a bit of a faff
 MSmits: tabbing doesnt work suddenly  
 ZarthaxX: i think he doesnt care about that
 ZarthaxX: he meant about the elements 
 ZarthaxX: if u can keep them close together
 MSmits: if you keep them close doesnt that mean they could be in the same bucket?
 ZarthaxX: if they fall in the same place u mean
 MSmits: I imagine a bucket as having an amount of room in memory that can hold multiple values
 ZarthaxX: aha
 MSmits: that means that if you want more buckets, you need more memory
 MSmits: and if you want less collisions, you need a larger capacity
 Astrobytes: You could have written your own hashtable by now MSmits
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i am not in a hurry, for now it is fine to use unordered map for Onitama
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/bucket_size/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/unordered_set/unordered_set/bucket_size/</a>
 MSmits: if I am even going to do transpositions
 ZarthaxX: the rehashign happens when there are many elements in buckets
 MSmits: yeah so it's like this. The more memory you assign, the smaller the chance of elements being in the same bucket
 ZarthaxX: yes
 MSmits: but the farther the buckets are apart
 MSmits: so the more cache misses you get
 ZarthaxX: aha
 ZarthaxX: but if u desgin a hash functin
 ZarthaxX: that tries to keep close states that are similar
 ZarthaxX: maybe u win
 MSmits: yeah but thats not easy to do in most games I think
 ZarthaxX: close = not in same bucket
 ZarthaxX: i know
 ZarthaxX: just saying
 ZarthaxX: anyway, worth researching
 MSmits: its a good point
 ZarthaxX: making your own type
 MSmits: right, well I am going to try to make my onitama bot work with random moves today
 ZarthaxX: gl with that
 MSmits: I want it to correctly record the states, create the moves and pick one at random
 ZarthaxX: i dont know about that game tho
 MSmits: that'll be half the bot probably
 MSmits: it's cool
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: i will go do uni stuff
 ZarthaxX: gl smito&#160;:)
 MSmits: hf&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: some avatars are too ugly to test against in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: the main page has a sectionIMPROVE YOUR CODING SKILLS WITH THE FOLLOWING PUZZLE
 eulerscheZahl: once it suggested a completely boring puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: but i didn't wanted to see the creator's face anymore, so i solved it
 Astrobytes: lol
 blasterpoard: I just filter ##.ng-scope.next-game.item with my adblock
 blasterpoard: together with everything clash-related
 eulerscheZahl: good decision
 blasterpoard: it's slightly annoying when CG tries to convince me I can improve by solving easy puzzles
 blasterpoard: and gain a new skill called "Conditions"
 JimmySmith: How does one progress without first learning the basics though? lol   We all learn different sir
 AntiSquid: ya blaster go learn the basics
 eulerscheZahl: when i was new on CG, you even had to unlock the hard puzzles by solving the easy ones first
 eulerscheZahl: i think they removed that feature now
 blasterpoard: I haven't noticed anything like that
 reCurse: Oh yeah I remember that
 eulerscheZahl: great, i'm not crazy then
 eulerscheZahl: annoyed me
 eulerscheZahl: kovi"that it maybe increased the looserate by 5%"so you lost more?
 Illedan: Hi
 ZarthaxX: hey illo
 kovi: lol euler. no
 CyrusTheCurator: I wish things like Codingame were around back in my 2012 AP computer science classes
 CyrusTheCurator: I took a massively long hiatus from C sci and now I'm paying for it D:, 7 years to catch up on
 AntiSquid: 2012 they only had a simple puzzle contest
 CyrusTheCurator: Well, no time like the present. Gotta do everything I can to make this tech career work
 wlesavo: kovi thx for PM
 stacked: halo
 cegprakash: what is the BGM used in Join the PAC Spring challenge video?
 cegprakash: I want the song plz I'm so addicted to it
 AntiSquid: google youtube to mp3
 Zenoscave: about 5K CP from first in US. I'm close
 Kissmyoss: Hi, it's possible to reset rank of challenge&#160;? i would like play with friend in wood league
 cegprakash: enemy is able to shoot me when I'm at 7 distance :O. I had this bug in my tracking when I assumed I've to be within distance of 6
 ZarthaxX: no Kissmyoss
 ZarthaxX: only way is to delete acc
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 wlesavo: is there a known issue with fonts changing to 13px in ide?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: can anyone tell me what is re library in python?
 tomatoes: regular expressions
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: thanks i'll read about it.
 wlesavo: YannT somehow it concerns only the code window, not whole page
 YannT: might be a shortcut oof the IIDE, I think its got those

 swamianilsaraswati: Hi ALlI am new to codingame and new to bot programming also.
 swamianilsaraswati: I started Coders Strike Back to program but I am unable to understand the next phase. How to win from Boss 4?
 swamianilsaraswati: Any help?How to think of the algorithm in terms of maths?
 kovi: nice pb4
 Scarfield: -3vel :p
 Scarfield: what league are boss 4 swamianilsaraswati
 stacked: how do i close the discord
 stacked: its so annoying
 stacked: and close all the open room tabs
 Uljahn: with adblock or userscript addon such as stylus
 MadKnight: yea i closed it with adblock
 swamianilsaraswati: might be silver @Scarfield
 cegprakash: does trigger mine has infinite cast range?
 tomatoes: yes
 cegprakash: oh makes sense
 Scarfield: if you are targeting your next checkpoint, subtracting 3vel from your pods target will help it adjust for its current velocity
 ZarthaxX: pb4 typo here? For a torpedo, it is simply the damage probability given the opponent presence map damageProbability*0.95^0
 pb4: 0.95^turn
 pb4: when turn = 0
 ZarthaxX: ah as i didnt see a ^turn
 ZarthaxX: aight
 Stunji_Ray: ji
 Stunji_Ray: hi
 cegprakash: ZarthaxX I added crappy mine and triggers..
 cegprakash: will I get promoted to Gold?
 cegprakash: I have added every possible thing there is
 cegprakash: why am I still in silver
 cegprakash: Crog stop wrecking me
 eulerscheZahl: then you added it wrong?
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't think it's possible to add everything and stay below the 100kB upload limit
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: I changed the constants in my eval
 cegprakash: and my rank is jumping again
 cegprakash: so there was this case where my bot went inside a choke point (forcing a SURFACE in the next turn) just so I can deal him a damage
 cegprakash: so I changed my scoring to never enter into choke points
 cegprakash: but looks like taking life away is more important
 cegprakash: risking our own life
 eulerscheZahl: it's a dangerous game
 eulerscheZahl: so don't hide under the table and start fighting
 cegprakash: u sure?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a39bb83-5113-4660-bc35-dc8b7ca3d8e2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3a39bb83-5113-4660-bc35-dc8b7ca3d8e2</a>
 eulerscheZahl: all a matter of timing
 cegprakash: that's my eval now
 cegprakash: should I change something
 eulerscheZahl: don't start a fight when it's not an advantage for you
 cegprakash: how do I know if I am at advantage
 cegprakash:&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: that's the hard part of the game
 cegprakash: how does my eval look
 eulerscheZahl: not gonna read that
 tobk: maybe that's a dumb question, but how do I set the game seed in the OoC offline runner?
 tobk: always uses 1337 and I can't find it in the readme
 wlesavo: in the Main.java gameRunner.setSeed();
 tomatoes: src/test/java/Main.java
 tobk: so you have to recompile it each time?
 tobk: hm, maybe I'll tweak that myself a bit...
 YamilBrayan: can someone help me with the exercise blowing fuse , i need the solution
 cegprakash: my bot gets into some weird timeouts&#160;:(
 Stunji_Ray: in what
 cegprakash: it was a bug.. it wasn't timeout.. my -INF was -10^7 but all my solutions returned lesser score than -10^7
 cegprakash: so my final soluton had some empty state
 cegprakash: 34% rank 48
 cegprakash: go go go
 cegprakash: Crog u resubmitted?
 Crog: yes
 cegprakash: we are wrecking each other
 cegprakash: instead of climbing
 Crog: with a slight improvement on mines
 cegprakash: did you start tracking yourself?
 Crog: tell me how to reach gold and I'll stop wrecking you
 cegprakash: haha
 Crog: no I'm not tracking myself
 cegprakash: so that's the way to reach gold I think :P 
 cegprakash: I have lot of room to improve my mines
 Crog: might be
 cegprakash: I always blast the top leftmost mine now
 cegprakash: trigger*
 cegprakash: and I am not learning from trigger result
 Crog: I'm choosing the best mine to trigger with my current knowledge  of where the opponent is, + I'm learning from the trigger result (except when the opponent does something that makes the analysis unsure)
 cegprakash: do u trigger and torpedo on the same turn
 Crog: yes
 cegprakash: I am unable to calculate the positions properly when I do so
 Crog: I don't get it , what's the difficulty&#160;? 
 cegprakash: if he gets damage only from one of them
 cegprakash: say 1 damage
 cegprakash: do u decide he took damage from torpedo or from trigger?
 TheFlashKnight_c529: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80d94786-eb52-4b2f-84ef-8c42c206f449">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80d94786-eb52-4b2f-84ef-8c42c206f449</a>
 Crog: ah you mean, do I analyze the result of the hit when I hit after firing a mine and a torpedo at the same turn&#160;? 
 Crog: so the answer is yes&#160;: when that happens I can make the assumption that at the previous turn the opponent was in either of the two blast areas - or in both of them 
 Crog: i.e. I'm sure the opponent was NOT in the remainder of the world
 tomatoes: im applying all explosions to "virtual games" and in the next turn prune by health mismatch
 cegprakash: my  bot always starts from 13,1 even though I am doing random spawn point
 Crog: what language are you using&#160;? 
 cegprakash: C++
 cegprakash: Crog I get what u mean.. I need to construct a damage map
 Crog: do you use default_random_engine&#160;?
 cegprakash: I just use rand() in c++ from cmath
 Crog: ok
 Crog: if you want to be "really" random  
 Crog: you need to set a varying seed
 Crog: srand()
 cegprakash: I'll try uniform distribution for spawn alone
 Crog: or alternatively you could switch to modern C++ - and use random_device 
 cegprakash: shouldn't be slow
 Crog: random_device is non deterministic
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/uniform_int_distribution">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/uniform_int_distribution</a>
 Crog: unless you need millions of random values per turn, you don't care how complex the random generation is 
 Crog: in my (c++) code I use default_random_engine coupled with uniform_int_distribution
 Crog: I prefer to use a deterministic random source - so as to be able to reproduce games and debug
 Swagboy: Hmm no Crog, it can get heavy before millions of call
 cegprakash: my spawn locations are now random
 cegprakash: thanks to uniform int distribution
 Astrobytes: what were you seeding srad() with before cegprakash?
 Astrobytes: *srand()
 cegprakash: no seed
 Astrobytes: ...
 cegprakash: only rand
 Astrobytes: call srand(seed) at start of main()
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c75956eb-f95f-4b22-97bc-2c4ba8b42390">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c75956eb-f95f-4b22-97bc-2c4ba8b42390</a>
 Astrobytes: I meant before when you were using rand()
 cegprakash: no seed 
 Astrobytes: from cmath
 Astrobytes: you have to seed it first
 Astrobytes: or you will get the same values
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453843307">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453843307</a> lovely replay of wrecking the silver boss
 cegprakash: but it only happens in IDE not in arena
 cegprakash: story of my life
 Astrobytes: Anyone got a brick wall I can talk to?
 cegprakash: srand is slow right?
 cegprakash: I like fast
 Astrobytes: Is your random the bottleneck in your code right now?
 cegprakash: yes I use simu
 cegprakash: so
 Astrobytes: Is your random the bottleneck in your code right now?
 Astrobytes: Have you profiled it and discovered that your rand( )was slowing you down?
 cegprakash: Don't think so
 cegprakash: only for spawn I was worriedd
 Astrobytes: Well then.
 Astrobytes: Use a xorshift or something if you're really bothered
 cegprakash: because I always used to spawn at 13m1
 cegprakash: 13,1*
 cegprakash: and enemy predict that easily
 Astrobytes: BECAUSE YOU DID NOT SEED srand()
 Astrobytes: I give up
 cegprakash: I am not using srand -_-
 cegprakash: only rand
 Crog: lol
 Astrobytes: if you use rand(), use srand(SEED) or YOU WILL GET THE SAME VALUES
 cegprakash: okay I try that
 Astrobytes: FML
 cegprakash: lets see if it improves my bot
 tomatoes: use srand before rand, not instead
 Crog: to be clear&#160;: use srand() once, then use rand () 
 Astrobytes: That's what I'm telling him tomatoes
 Astrobytes: Astrobytes 10:48PMcall srand(seed) at start of main()
 tomatoes: :upside_down:
 Astrobytes: Trying to tell ceg things is often like banging your head against a wall, it's just how he is
 cegprakash: first run with srand won the game
 cegprakash: so I'm submitting
 Astrobytes: :no_mouth:
 cegprakash: not bad.. 11 wins in 14
 cegprakash: srand works
 cegprakash: I'm using 	srand(time(0));
 cegprakash: as I read in some blog
 Astrobytes: Yep. But if you want it to be reproducible in the IDE you need a fixed seed
 Astrobytes: Like based on the map, or your id or smth
 cegprakash: but fixed seed is not random
 Astrobytes: I literally give up
 MSmits: don't think thats fair Astrobytes
 MSmits: (to the wall)
 TheFlashKnight_c529: hello, how can i play 1v1 with my friend?
 MSmits: clash of code I guess?
 cegprakash: just choose the player u want to play against instead of the boss
 cegprakash: you can remove the boss TheFlashKnight_c529
 TheFlashKnight_c529: yah, i found it, thx &lt;3
 Astrobytes: MSmits lol, right?
 MSmits: yep
 cegprakash: wow srand took my bot from #50 to top 10 already
 VincentBab: Hey MSmits I need your help for UTTT :D
 MSmits: what do you want to know VincentBab?
 Astrobytes: Moral of the story kids, always seed your rng... :expressionless:
 VincentBab: I just remembered that i try this game a while ago and didnt success to pass legend&#160;:(
 MSmits: to get into legend, the easiest way is to do the following 3 things:
 MSmits: 1) Fast language
 VincentBab: I tried AlphaBeta &amp; MCTS
 MSmits: 2) bitboard
 MSmits: 3) mcts
 VincentBab: I optimized all my best even replacing log and sqrt function with fast ones
 MSmits: it's easy to make a mistake with mcts though
 MSmits: how many rollouts in the 2nd turn?
 VincentBab: humm I dont remember, let my start it again xD
 MSmits: it's a good benchmark
 MSmits: you need about 25k to reach legend I think, not entirely sure
 Astrobytes: cegprakash do you use C++ or C in your job?
 MSmits: I have between 90k-130k depending on which cpu is used
 cegprakash: neither
 Astrobytes: Good
 Astrobytes: :D
 cegprakash: I use the shittiest language I ever known
 Astrobytes: PHP or JS?
 cegprakash: JS
 cegprakash: :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Has it's place I suppose
 cegprakash: they both do
 cegprakash: but PHP has improved
 cegprakash: I like Laravel
 Astrobytes: I didn't use PHP since about 2009-ish
 VincentBab: hum my IA is in AlphaBeta mode, i need to remember how to switch it to MCTS xD
 VincentBab: AI*
 MSmits: hehe ok, it's not that easy to get legend with  a minimax bot though
 MSmits: the thing is, minimax requires creativity, namely you need to create an evaluation function
 VincentBab: i'm 15 gold with minmax
 MSmits: mcts in uttt doesnt, random simulation is enough
 VincentBab: yeah thats the hard part
 MSmits: thats why its easier
 VincentBab: but also a fun part
 MSmits: you mean eval? Meh I never like having to write eval
 VincentBab: i like watching replays and think how i can improve my eval xD
 MSmits: yeah good luck with that on uttt, it's really hard to tell what is going on
 MSmits: what language btw?
 Astrobytes: Nice submit cegprakash, definite improvement
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: I literally have no bugs in my tracking except there are rooms to improve
 Astrobytes: "I literally have no bugs" said everyone ever :P
 cegprakash: but I am thinking of playing around with my magic numbers
 Astrobytes: Are you using a GA as usual?
 cegprakash: random search + mutation
 Astrobytes: For the whole thing or for separate parts?
 cegprakash: whole thing
 cegprakash: at each turn I fist decide I need to use SURFACE this turn or not
 cegprakash: then based on the result I've some set of combos
 cegprakash: that I try at random
 VincentBab: humm my optimisation must not be so good... 20k rollout at second turn xD
 wlesavo: "I literally have no bugs" famous last words
 Astrobytes: VincentBab C++?
 wlesavo: reading pb's post mortem i wondered how i won a single game with him
 VincentBab: yes
 Astrobytes: You have the pragmas?
 VincentBab: yes
 Astrobytes: Then it's time to mine MSmits for information :P
 MSmits: ah, 20k is not enough no
 MSmits: do you use an object pool? 
 MSmits: what does your tree node look like?
 MSmits: do you save the gamestate on the node or separately?
 Astrobytes: Btw, MSmits, you *were* referring to potential cache misses etc using unordered_map earlier right? By not knowing where the memory is being allocated?
 VincentBab: yes I have object poolNode *node = &amp;Node::nodes[Node::nbNodes++];
 MSmits: ah ok, if you want to paste your node class here (just the properties on it) I can tell you what is wrong, if anything
 MSmits: or PM me, that works too
 MSmits: Astrobytes I was just wondering what would happen to locality if I gave my unordered map a capacity of 100 mb
 MSmits: to avoid resizing
 VincentBab: ok&#160;:)
 tomatoes: i tuned "c" and it gives me a good boost
 MSmits: my theory is that it would spread out the buckets in memory and destroy locality and cause misses
 Astrobytes: It will
 Astrobytes: Your only way around that is with a custom allocator
 Astrobytes: Or write your own
 Astrobytes: The unordered_map doesn't care where it's putting the data, it only cares whether the addresses are valid
 Astrobytes: I feel you should consult re Curse on this, I'm by no means an expert. But there's a reason why people create custom STL-like containers
 reCurse: Locality in hash map...
 MSmits: what if the hash map is really large reCurse?
 MSmits: if you make it too large, you get locality problems dont you?
 reCurse: I'd say it probably stopped mattering way before that
 Astrobytes: You get locality problems regardless
 MSmits: what I mean is, to avoid resizing you can set the capacity to be large
 MSmits: but too large gives locality issues
 MSmits: maybe i am worrying about non-issues here
 reCurse: Likely so
 reCurse: You're going to have locality issues wayyyyy before 100mb
 MSmits: it was just a number i mentioned
 MSmits: could be anything really
 reCurse: And worrying about locality with hashing is like worrying about not having hair anywhere when having a dog
 MSmits: I was comparing it to using a List in C#... it's often best to give it a large capacity so it doesnt resize as your list grows
 MSmits: might not be a good parallel
 reCurse: Yeah but then it doesnt matter
 reCurse: Because most of your data will always be concentrated at the beginning
 reCurse: A hash table will spread it out by definition
 reCurse: A hash lookup is also known as a cache miss
 MSmits: hmm ok, but wont it spread out more if you give it a large size?
 cegprakash: if (players[1 - myId].life &lt;= 0) {	score += fatalityScore;}Is it possible to write this statement without if condition
 reCurse: Sure but it already stopped mattering a long time ago
 MSmits: hmm ok
 reCurse: Unless your hash table was really small
 reCurse: But if that was the case
 reCurse: Then you'd have been better off with a vector anyway
 cegprakash: oh wait I can precompute score based on lifes
 cegprakash: f**k me
 MSmits: think about expansion of 10,000 nodes in a mcts run and me adding them all to transposition tables
 reCurse: As far as cache is concerned you already betrayed it
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: i dunno why we spent so much time talking about this today, it's not even a very pressing issue to me atm. But good you put it to rest&#160;:)
 reCurse: You'd prefer explaining RNG?
 Astrobytes: don't get me started
 MSmits: err 
 Astrobytes: See MSmits, when in doubt, call reCurse
 MSmits: no need to discuss rng as far as I'm concerned :P
 reCurse: I was poking fun at someone else
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: yeah i read something about using a fixed seed
 MSmits: in the last contest I made a seed out of islands
 Astrobytes: no, rng with *no seed at all*
 MSmits: oh, you want to hook quantummechanical experiments up to your PC?
 Astrobytes: Goddammit man scroll up
 MSmits: allright 
 MSmits: ahhh the wall thing
 MSmits: got it
 Astrobytes: I was seconds away from pinging reCurse and leaving
 reCurse: Oh I'm not bothering anymore
 Astrobytes: :D

 Astrobytes: Preferable to explaining things to brick walls&#160;;)
 MSmits: hey but the brick wall finally understood didn't it
 MSmits: you succeeded
 Astrobytes: Don't know why I bothered. Not like it would be reciprocated 
 MSmits: ahh well maybe someone else read it too
 MSmits: maybe you helped droves of people without realizing it
 Astrobytes: You're such an optimist!
 MSmits: people log in briefly and they go... ohh Astrobytes put another gem of wisdom up, quick, copy it down for the future
 Astrobytes: "another gem of wisdom" my ass :D
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Maybe I'll switch careers and do tech support...
 MSmits: if you feel your life has too few brick walls in it
 Astrobytes: lol, ever dealt with pharmaceutical company bosses?
 MSmits: not recently
 Astrobytes: But yeah, "have you tried unplugging it" would wear thin I guess
 MSmits: yeah

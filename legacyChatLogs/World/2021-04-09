 Smelty: well...I finished back to the 80's escape room (2 people) in 1h46m.....not bad I think
 ErrorRazor: How have I never heard of escape.codingame.com before
 ErrorRazor: If anyone wants to test it out tonight (in 8-12 hours) hmu
 derjack: and apparently not many people heard of something else than clashes in CG
 JarlWolf: Hello there, I am new. How is everyone doing 
 Babyface-Developer: I am fine ( nearly dead LOL)
 JarlWolf: hahaha why is that?
 Babyface-Developer: COC everyday LOL
 JarlWolf: Lol is it a challenge? or the classic Clash of Clans game
 JarlWolf: btw I am new here so I am sure I have got heaps of things to catch up with. 
 Uljahn: just explore the site, there is a lot of fun things to do
 Babyface-Developer: welcome, I find codingame is really fun
 JarlWolf: Thanks a lot. Yea I just finished the Thor's challenge I enjoyed it 
 Babyface-Developer: Lol is it a challenge =&gt; for sure&#160;:))
 Babyface-Developer: clash of code full of experts&#160;:)))
 JarlWolf: haha I do not doubt it. oh wow full of experts sounds amazing. 
 JarlWolf: Are you ppl seniors level? I am just getting into intermediate 
 Uljahn: most c++ experts do not play clashes though
 JarlWolf: oh really? is there any particular reason? 
 Uljahn: yea, there is a shortest mode where c++ gets wrecked by js, ruby and python
 jrke: cause it takes bit more time than other languages to even code simple things and also its not short which causes losing for them
 JarlWolf: oh I see. Yea it makes a lot of sense.  
 Uljahn: but for bot AI multiplayers c++ is the best choice because of performance reasons
 derjack: and clashes may not be fun for them
 derjack: they would use time to make multiplayer bot than do clashes
 Uljahn: indeed
 JarlWolf: very true. Well I will try to have a look. Perhaps I get to have some fun there too. 
 JarlWolf: You ppl come online everyday? 
 Uljahn: yep
 Uljahn: JarlWolf: take a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55547/how-to-get-started-on-codingame">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55547/how-to-get-started-on-codingame</a>

 codeing: hello how to send message with notification in cg&#160;?
 derjack: you cant send notifications oO
 codeing: nope
 codeing: can you sned me a specific message&#160;?
 JSboss: DMs are possible by clicking the username in the chat or the private message button on profile. also typing full username in a shared channel or DM the msg will appear red to the user
 codeing: sometimes i get message in red color here&#160;!
 codeing: how to do&#160;?
 derjack: impossible codeing
 codeing: yes
 codeing: what impossible&#160;?
 derjack: codeing why would you get red messages :v
 codeing: the last one you send have red color .
 codeing: wait

 sid12123: how to delete
 MSmits: dont worry
 MSmits: it's just for the future
 sid12123: ohk thanks
 MSmits: what you can do is just ask one time if anyone wants to clash with you, thats ok
 MSmits: then you can send them the link
 derjack: hi MSmits
 MSmits: hi pony!
 derjack: have you seen my n-tuple tic tac toe?
 MSmits: just had my last FP test
 MSmits: no, whats up with that?
 MSmits: you rank 1 now?
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple">https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple</a>
 derjack: gonna make some playground about it
 MSmits: is this your live bot?
 MSmits: oh this is normal TTT?
 derjack: no lol, this is 3x3 tic tac toe
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: it's great of you to share
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: this tells me how to train?
 struct: hi MSmits
 MSmits: you do realize that is exactly what I most lack in. for example othello
 MSmits: I know how to already do the ntuples
 MSmits: so this is awesome
 MSmits: hi struct
 derjack: well this train on all positions of TTT
 MSmits: well that doesn't matter if it is general enough does it?
 derjack: and then 1-ply minimax bot becomes perfect
 derjack: well as long as you have labeled positions to teain on, sure
 derjack: train
 MSmits: cool, so now you've given me two things that will keep me busy for months
 MSmits: the oware nn thing
 MSmits: and the ntuple thintg
 MSmits: dont even know which to do first
 derjack: i could also make you to seat by round table on the corner
 MSmits: that must be  a Polish expression or a pony expression
 derjack: oh
 MSmits: i am guessing there is an episode, Ponies of the Round Table
 MSmits: based on the Arthur mythos
 derjack: it was supposed to be a joke like 'Chuck Norris can sit at the corner of a round table'
 MSmits: ahhh ok
 MSmits: I noticed in most games my meta mcts approach just doesn't work unless coupled with targeted booking
 MSmits: exception being yavalath and C4
 MSmits: it improves the gameplay a little bit
 MSmits: but not a lot
 derjack: :bomb:
 MSmits: C4 seems to be solving to a draw btw
 MSmits: but not 100% sure
 MSmits: at move 1 i mean
 MSmits: 2-3-4 seem to be win for p1, 0 is win for p2
 MSmits: I think I mostly found the best lines of play, but to actually solve it needs to finish all the bad moves too and that takes a long time
 derjack: draws are the longest as they require to fill the game completely
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: that's why
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41464006-4230-4ffd-b41f-9a2a2d693141">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41464006-4230-4ffd-b41f-9a2a2d693141</a>
 MSmits: I stopped the other moves because they were clearly converging 
 MSmits: i may finish them later
 MSmits: 800 MB on disk&#160;:)
 MSmits: I can go up to 2 billion nodes before i need a new database system
 MSmits: hope I make it&#160;:)
 Manah3.deb: Hi guys
 derjack: 2 billions? due to 32bit addresing?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I use a very simple system that has this limitation
 MSmits: but i am at 8 million, so there's a ways to go
 Manah3.deb: I have a problem on the Coders Strike Back, I setting the thurst thanks to the next_checkpoint_dist
 MSmits: it speeds up a lot though because most nodes are near end of game, so i sometimes do 10 games in a second
 MSmits: i should say near solve of game (around turn 30)
 MSmits: Manah3.deb what language?
 Manah3.deb: however the thrust always is to 100 on the output
 Manah3.deb: pyhton
 Manah3.deb: if ((next_checkpoint_dist &lt;= 400) &amp; (next_checkpoint_dist &gt; 200)): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d648d3fb-75a4-4841-a8bd-6d0a80e92d06">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d648d3fb-75a4-4841-a8bd-6d0a80e92d06</a>
 dbdr: MSmits why 2 billion, you use 31 bits?
 MSmits: I use persistent dictionary, a C# library
 MSmits: so i dont need any database stuff
 MSmits: it's as easy as using a normal dictionary
 MSmits: except it stores on HD
 dbdr: ah, C# is always signed like Java?
 MSmits: no idea, it just says so on the description. I didn't think beyond that. But if I try to have a c++ array that uses more than this amount of memory, it also causes issues
 MSmits: cant use more than 2 GB
 MSmits: so i've seen similar things where you would expect to have 4B, but could only have 2B
 struct: Manah3.deb next check point distance will never be lower than 600
 struct: since it is the radius of the checkpoint
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/microsoft/ManagedEsent/blob/master/Documentation/PersistentDictionaryDocumentation.md">https://github.com/microsoft/ManagedEsent/blob/master/Documentation/PersistentDictionaryDocumentation.md</a>
 MSmits: if you're interested dbdr, if you're ever using C# and lookign for a really simple persistent storage, it's great
 MSmits: I have 13 GB of my HD stuck in various instances of this, for my meta mcts's
 dbdr: do you have bcckups?&#160;;)
 MSmits: i make them sometimes, not enough probably
 MSmits: just copy the stuff to a different HD
 MSmits: oh and google drive
 dbdr: reminds me of the guys who solved othello and the like, over a decade or so&#160;:)
 MSmits: not othello i think
 MSmits: but i know what you mean
 MSmits: the C4 guy does that
 MSmits: othello isn't solved but it might as well be
 derjack: oh my prince philip is dead
 Coder_prabhat: :slight_smile:
 MSmits: for a second i thought you were saying this in pony character
 MSmits: "your prince phillip"
 derjack: forgot , after oh my
 dbdr: probably I was thinking of checkers
 derjack: checkers is solved, othello not
 MSmits: checkers was solved by scientists
 derjack: though roughly the same complexity
 MSmits: mmh i think othello is a bit more complex because it has more branching and there are no endgame tables
 MSmits: checkers has 10 piece tables
 Djolesd02: ide gas
 derjack: on the other hoof othello has 8 symmetries
 MSmits: yeah, but that's pretty much negligible when it comes to solving. I know a factor of 8 seems a lot, but that's basically the same as 1 extra level of depth in a game with a branching of 8
 MSmits: and most have more branching than that
 MSmits: basically, you have a total of 8x less nodes needed
 MSmits: btw, i had this discussion with re curse not so long ago&#160;:)
 MSmits: i should say, it matters a lot when just looking at a single game, solving it 8x faster or so. But when comparing games you're mostly looking at orders of magnitude, and 8 is less than 1 order of magnitude
 Louis.: salut
 TechnocraticLenny: does anyone know what the easiest one is?

 TechnocraticLenny: ...
 TechnocraticLenny: i must really suck
 struct: It takes a while to get the bases on programming
 VizGhar: describe your trouble. maybe there are some immediate steps
 Martialcart: one tip for decent could be that you report index, not mountain height
 Martialcart: idk, that's was the thing i found counter intuitive
 MSmits: I had problems with the descent too, when I first got to cg
 MSmits: I found it confusing that you had a "game loop" and a maximum height loop
 MSmits: I didn't know how the game loop worked

 IJustKilledYouV2: do you guys think its really worth to learn in 2021?
 IJustKilledYouV2: i want honest opinion tho, don't say things just bcs its your fav language
 BlaiseEbuth: No. The end of the world is close, so programming is a waste of time. Go dig a bunker.
 jacek: i only use c++ for competition here. i dont use c++ professionally
 jacek: for low level stuff probably rust will take over :unamused:
 IJustKilledYouV2: oh im sorry BlaiseEbuth, i will just quit, i wanted to go to programming school but now i see the truth, thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 jacek: nyoro~n
 SourceOfBugs: Java is still one of the most used languages and it's around since '96 with lots of (imo) better alternatives that do the same thing. I don't think C++ is going anywhere soon – although for new projects Rust is probably going to take over more and moreso it really depends no where you want to work, I guess

 UnnamedCodinGamer: jacek it is so laggy that I can not scroll down to read 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: strange
 struct: UnnamedCodinGamer probably because replays are huge
 struct: Its probably 1MB+
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am not replaying anything ...
 ota-alt: dose anyone undetsand the thor thingy
 Wontonimo: yes
 jacek: how may we help you
 VizGhar: o.O
 ota-alt: do u know what the rules mean because I don't understand them&#160;:/ Im an begginer 
 VizGhar: jacek changed personality?
 jacek: hm?
 Wontonimo: ota-alt i can see from your profile that it looks like your first puzzle
 jacek: you have hints in the left
 ota-alt: but isnt hints just cheating
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: it's called research
 ota-alt:  
 Wontonimo: kidding aside, if you are stuck and don't have any other recourse then hints are the way to go
 Wontonimo: Here is another puzzle that you may find easier to start with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent</a>
 ota-alt: hmm ok
 Wontonimo: and this is one is visually nice and not too hard for starting out (especially if you know a little physics) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>
 ota-alt: whats physics
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ota-alt:&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: hey
 VizGhar: :D
 ZarthaxX: ota-alt he got frustrated coz you dont know physics
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 WannaBeHum1n: how can i 1cs1 my friend in coders strike again
 ota-alt: how do u make the tetx red
 jacek: WannaBeHum1n in the ide?
 ZarthaxX: if you get tagged by your name you see it red ota-alt
 Wontonimo: WannaBeHum1n - at the bottom in the IDE click 'delete' on the boss/ai then you'll get an option to add your friend
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Was this mars lander episode 1 puzzle where you needed to watch  your ears?
 WannaBeHum1n: yes in the ide
 Wontonimo: ota-alt btw, i wasn't frustrated about the physics thing ... just being funny.  if you don't know physics you are still welcome here.
 Wontonimo: UnnamedCodinGamer ears?
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx
 WannaBeHum1n: idk how to tag u
 WannaBeHum1n: but u know who ua re
 jacek: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: just type the other persons name.  use tab to autocomplete
 Wontonimo: i tag you by typing Wann[tab]
 Wontonimo: and it becomes "i tag you by typing WannaBeHum1n"
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Wontonimo, there was a huge audible bang in one of those, possibly in all of them 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: when your ship crashes
 Wontonimo: oh ... right.  yeah, turn off sound.  I don't know why it doesn't do that for me but I've heard that is a problem UnnamedCodinGamer
 jacek: maybe youre deaf
 Wontonimo: yeah, there is that
 Wontonimo: well, wouldn't you know it, actually coding in the win condition to your bot will improve it's ranking.  fancy that.  Just moved up 10 ranks in slcc 
 linjoehan: man finally got the high score thing to work now I can try working on training the AI
 Wontonimo: i haven't been following, what are you working on linjoehan&#160;?
 struct: that small change made you increase 10 ranks?
 Wontonimo: yeah struct.  previously I only had a gradient proxy of score, but not the actual win condition
 linjoehan: I'm making an agent to play Tetris in a Jnes emulator
 linjoehan: classic tetris that is
 struct: Im still thinking on how I should prune moves
 linjoehan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/linjoehan/TetrisAI">https://github.com/linjoehan/TetrisAI</a> if you want to have a look see.
 Wontonimo: what's your algo struct?  Mine is simulator+GA (all taken from my CSB GA)
 struct: im going to try smitsimax
 linjoehan: AI is basic but gets to kill screen at least.
 linjoehan: *sometimes
 Wontonimo: linjoehan - put a few screen shots on your github page if you want more likes/views/forks
 Wontonimo: That's really cool linjoehan, what got you interested in that?
 linjoehan: I saw the CTWC on youtube and thought mm I wonder if... so here I am
 linjoehan: CTWC = classic tetris world championship
 Wontonimo: i should re-read smitsimax.  I just did a mulit-agent MCTS for SC2020 and it did well, but I don't know if there are some gold-nuggets in the smitsimax that i missed
 struct: With GA you need to do each pod at once right?
 jacek: and youre gonna do reinforcement learning for tetris?
 Wontonimo: struct - yeah for GA I budget 15% of the time for my pod, then 15% for the next (15% for the 3rd if it exists) then the remainder is spend on improving mine
 Wontonimo: unlike CSB, the angle isn't relative but instead absolute.  That made a huge improvement
 struct: yeah but with smitsi since it is mcts like
 struct: I dont want many moves
 Wontonimo: right, i was thinking about that earlier today
 struct: Currently I have 25 
 struct: which is just 360 / 15
 struct: + dont move
 Wontonimo: and all the thrust levels
 struct: no
 struct: only 100
 Wontonimo: all power all the time.  i like it
 struct: I havent implemented boost yet
 linjoehan: jacek I don't know how to do that yet so maybe. I was thinking to do it with a variable eval and Genetics to find where it should be varied to
 Wontonimo: okay, so here is another idea to reduce that search space
 ota-alt: I cant figure out any of the problems without looking at the solution&#160;:(
 struct: ota-alt try solving it with pen and paper first
 Wontonimo: instead of ALL angles, include the angle towards the next checkpoint, +- 10 degrees of that, the angle towards the each opponent +- 10 degrees.  see where that gets you
 Wontonimo: and for the next checkpoint, use the p-3*v for thrust
 ota-alt: struct what do u mean?
 struct: I will try it, thanks
 struct: ota-alt sometimes solving the problem with pen and paper will help 
 struct: Then you will know what to code
 ota-alt: but how would I do do that I don't understand
 Wontonimo: sounds like you are fairly new to programming ota-alt.  Although I hope you get into this site, it may be a bit hard at this time.  Does anyone have a recommendation of something a bit more approachable for beginners?
 Wontonimo: codingame is hard(er)
 struct: Yeah, its not suited to beginners
 Wontonimo: i've heard that <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codewars.com/">https://www.codewars.com/</a> is good
 Wontonimo: but i've never actually tried it
 ota-alt: I used scatch before but uh not very good to learn pproggraming with
 Westicles: Intelligence is more important than experience.  Either you are capable of doing it or you are not
 Wontonimo: oh, i was going to suggest scratch.  good for you!  
 Wontonimo: Westicles lol
 ota-alt: I got into python like 2 moths ago just slow at learning oof
 Wontonimo: I can see that code wars supports python <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codewars.com/?language=python">https://www.codewars.com/?language=python</a>
 ota-alt: hmm ok
 Wontonimo: struct - I don't know if what I suggested would actually work.  Why I think it would work is that your MCTS will become a search of micro heuristics instead of moves.  This did really well for me in Mars Lander optimization
 Wontonimo: the micro heuristics are&#160;: go to next checkpoint , hit an opponent
 Wontonimo: and that's a much smaller search space than all moves
 Wontonimo: Scarfield - what are you using for slcc?
 Astrobytes: smitsi
 Wontonimo: Astrobytes, are you using smitsi?
 Astrobytes: Nope
 Wontonimo: you were around 30 something and now you shot ahead of me!  what are you using?
 Astrobytes: Modified version of my CSB, just a GA, nothing fancy
 Astrobytes: (RHEA GA)
 Wontonimo: sigh ... my GA isn't as good then 
 Astrobytes: Keep tweaking it
 therealbeef: GA doesn't seem so suitable for this kind of game
 Astrobytes: It was actually the top at one point (for CSB) , before the minimax variant, then NNs, then Smitsi, then NNs from Hell
 therealbeef: that's the problem with GAs
 Wontonimo: what's the problem?
 therealbeef: quick gains, but not really optimal
 Astrobytes: They have their applications, on CG all GAs are just RHEA, nothing interesting. So limited, yes.
 Wontonimo: on CSB my GA got 85th, so no shabby.
 therealbeef: it's randomized, which means it helps when you don't know how to find the optimal solution, but once people start to understand the game better, they can typically come up with a better solution
 Wontonimo: no, i disagree.  there is no need to make it a random start.  you can have it start from a place of reason
 Astrobytes: Ah, well, they're usually pretty well tuned. Not just full random.
 Wontonimo: i started slcc with the p-3*v , and then when switching to GA, it starts with p-3*v as the baseline
 therealbeef: not fully random, but randomized. it's different from making small steps where you know every step improves the solution for example
 Astrobytes: I mean you sort the best and mutate/crossover among those
 Wontonimo: yeah, use a mutate functions that is small and an eval function that discounts the future
 Wontonimo: and then your gradient becomes smoother
 Wontonimo: now your GA is searching a nice gradient
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you have to discount. Or you're gonna get stuck in a local maxima at some point
 therealbeef: but if you have a nice gradient you dont need randomized search
 therealbeef: i wonder if CSB has many local maxima
 therealbeef: it feels convex
 Astrobytes: There's not much wrong with jumping around the solution space a little
 Wontonimo: i see what you are saying.  if you can calculate the derivative of the gradient, then of course, just do it empirically. 
 ZarthaxX: RHEA astro?
 ZarthaxX: explain

 Wontonimo: Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms 
 Astrobytes: ^ thanks Wontonimo
 jacek: trolling algorithms, i might like that
 therealbeef: i think GAs have a use, but it depends on the search space
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxXolutionaryAlgorithm: just to distinguish from other evolutionary algos which can get really kinda deep
 Astrobytes: (subject-wise, not search depth)
 Zenoscave: PEW PEW
 Zenoscave: Seems I've dropped bit in sofia
 Wontonimo: so, care to share what your last change was Astrobytes&#160;?  (at a high level of course)
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: I think I just fixed a typo from an earlier version :D
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: heyyy dude, yes, competition is... fierce!
 Wontonimo: oh thanks, i'll try that too&#160;:/ 
 Zenoscave: I've only 42 lines of ruby, so... Probably about time time to sim
 Astrobytes: I'll get back to you on what it was Wontonimo (doing about 4 things at once here)
 Wontonimo: lol
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: Ah the math approach
 jacek: :x
 Zenoscave: Normalization of vectors is funnnn
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes since when ppl use this type of ga? damn
 ZarthaxX: PEW PEW
 Smelty: `~'
 Zenoscave: PEW PEW zarthie
 Westicles: Is Dapo really expected to win, or is that just a running joke?
 Astrobytes: No, if there's a prize he most probably will.
 darkhorse64: in the last semi private contest, he first submitted 15mn before the end
 Astrobytes: normally it's 15 ms :D
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 darkhorse64: he found a bug, break the submit, and restarted
 Astrobytes: I mean, he's good. I can't knock him for what he does. It's allowed on here to hide, if you can win like that then go ahead, I ain't bothered.
 ZarthaxX: by good do you mean god?
 Astrobytes: heh no, he's good.
 ZarthaxX: i would say he is a beast lol
 ZarthaxX: it's sad that he doesnt share his knowledge tho
 ZarthaxX: never saw a postmortem from him
 vagos: ppl never use javascript on this&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hehe yeah, fair! I never understood why people have any issue with him on here tbh, he's always been really nice to me.
 ZarthaxX: he has been rude
 Astrobytes: Apparently this is true. I can only speak from my experience
 ZarthaxX: you werent born in cg yet tho, so you didnt get to see it
 ZarthaxX: those were the dark years, the reign of terror of dapo (?
 Astrobytes: I was CG born in 2015, I just failed to do anything. I had no clue about contests. Just thought there were puzzles
 ZarthaxX: damn before me
 ZarthaxX: :C
 ZarthaxX: i got 40 first take that&#160;!
 Astrobytes: haha oh nice! shit, I never noticed that
 Illedan: Nice
 Astrobytes: Or maybe I did and forgot :thinking:
 Illedan: My first contest was 500
 Astrobytes: Gratz anyway tho!
 Illedan: and I had no clue how to do anything better
 ZarthaxX: got 40 yesterday haha
 ZarthaxX: clash big achievement
 ZarthaxX: 500 rank?
 Astrobytes: ffs, clashing, ZarthaxX you knob
 Illedan: Oh, thought you talked about contest ranks :P
 ZarthaxX: thanks guys &lt;3
 Illedan: pff
 Illedan: ^^
 Illedan: gg zarth
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i didnt really play
 ZarthaxX: made a tool that entered games
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Astrobytes: A big boy played for you then ran away?
 ZarthaxX: if i had a kid i would have done that
 jacek: ban
 ZarthaxX: (?
 Astrobytes: Illedan: my first was Code Royale, I still have no idea how I got into silver with the shit I wrote :D
 Illedan: lol
 Smelty: ^^
 ZarthaxX: how is that gaming equipment going illo
 Illedan: shhh
 Astrobytes: It didn't get into silver on submit when the multi opened, 
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes happens, i didnt get legend in many games when multi opened
 ZarthaxX: so sad
 Wontonimo: i still haven't got into a contest ... my first is coming up in a few weeks
 Wontonimo: so noob
 ZarthaxX: -&gt; wins
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539222887">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539222887</a>I code a lot of stuff. And this is now my greatness. NO idea where it failed :sob:
 ZarthaxX: wanna play a clash Astrobytes :D
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: Bite my dull, non-metal ass
 ZarthaxX: damn so sad Illedan
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes aight but AFTER that wanna play
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: i need to get to top 1k
 ZarthaxX: :c
 Wontonimo: Illedan - are you using relative angles or absolute angles in your search.  it kinda looks like relative is searching for the next target
 Wontonimo: wait ... you are #3 ... 
 Illedan: :P
 ZarthaxX: he is gud
 Wontonimo: really, i thought there were hundreds of people in 13th place
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: what
 Astrobytes: Sarcasm ZarthaxsM
 Illedan: AHHH
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Illedan: My boost search only allowed it to use 0-120 angle -.-
 ZarthaxX: so chat found a bug
 Illedan: Sure, I'll just share my code and you find the bug?
 Wontonimo: therealbeef - what are you suing in slcc?  not GA, that we've established
 Wontonimo: *using
 Astrobytes: Sounds great Illedan, put it on Discord though :P
 ZarthaxX: i said chat found a bug, not that we will find more Illedan
 ZarthaxX: but send me an email
 ZarthaxX: i will fix your code
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 therealbeef: wontonimo just gradient descent
 Illedan: Wontonimo, I'm using GA
 Wontonimo: WHA&#160;!?!  okay, now my GA is looking sad and underperforming Illedan 
 therealbeef: i used the algo i had made for search race; it works well there, but can't deal so well with opponents
 ota-alt: it may have took me an hour but I finally fished the Decnet&#160;:)&#160;:)&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: okay, i have to admit my GA is dumb.  it has a population of ... drum roll ... 2!  And no cross over or diversity metric
 ZarthaxX: 2????????
 Illedan: That is not a GA
 Illedan: Basic MC
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 therealbeef: adam and eve?
 Wontonimo: okay ... time to make a population.  should only be 5-10 lines of code
 Kitkat260: hi
 Westicles: There's our favorite FBI agent
 Wontonimo: ^^
 ZarthaxX: who lol
 Wontonimo: hey Kit kat FBI, while you are here may as well learn how to program
 ZarthaxX: what is happening lol
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: Things! And Stuff!
 octopuscabbage: use cross entropy method don't use genetic algorithms, CEM is simpler and works better it just doesn't have a "cool name"
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes thanks i guess :P
 The_10x_Engineer: For Ghost in the Cell what is the time delay
 The_10x_Engineer: I mean like what is the maximum time
 The_10x_Engineer: woops
 ZarthaxX: The_10x_Engineer you can find it in the puzzle
 Astrobytes: should say at the bottom of the statement?
 Wontonimo: it's in the description
 ZarthaxX: statement
 ZarthaxX: i won whatever
 ZarthaxX: you both owe me a cookie
 The_10x_Engineer: ZarthaxX alright
 Astrobytes: shut up ZarthaxX :P
 ZarthaxX: that's abuse of power right there
 ZarthaxX: :c
 Astrobytes: Bite me
 ZarthaxX: i would but you are too far
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 The_10x_Engineer: I dont see it :pensive:
 The_10x_Engineer: It doesn't look like it's there
 The_10x_Engineer: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: very bottom
 The_10x_Engineer: "E.g. Capture a close factory which produces only 1 cyborg OR capture a distant factory which produces 3 cyborgs."
 The_10x_Engineer: tjat
 The_10x_Engineer: that's what I see
 The_10x_Engineer: at the bottom
 Astrobytes: check Constraints?
 The_10x_Engineer: Where
 ZarthaxX: in the very deep of the ocean 
 Astrobytes: There is a trench
 Wontonimo: and in that trench
 Astrobytes: there is a ....
 ZarthaxX: The_10x_Engineer scroll super down
 ZarthaxX: there is a part that says
 ZarthaxX: Output for one game turn
 ZarthaxX: do you see that
 ZarthaxX: he is ded
 ZarthaxX: :coffin:
 Smelty: there is a...
 ZarthaxX: he is trolling us
 Astrobytes: road
 Wontonimo: a road to madness
 Wontonimo: or spongebob
 ZarthaxX: patrick?
 Astrobytes: Definitely no simple highway
 Smelty: nary, there shalt be onion
 Smelty: on the road
 Topazz: rip me
 Astrobytes: But you'll be torn aparty
 Astrobytes: *apart
 Wontonimo: apart at aparty ... like a pinata
 The_10x_Engineer: ZarthaxX I'm looking now
 The_10x_Engineer: Oh
 The_10x_Engineer: wait so does that mean I can just use C++ and speed it up
 Astrobytes: Sensing a new hellraiser movie "We'll tear your soul aparty-ayyyy YOUR PINATA WILL BE LEGENDARY! IN MEXICO AND HELL!"
 ZarthaxX: The_10x_Engineer i mean c++ is the fastest
 Scarfield: its getting late i can tell xD
 ZarthaxX: Scarfield they are hallucinating
 Wontonimo: more like work finished 2 hours ago for me and i've been drinking since
 Astrobytes: The_10x_Engineer: Yes, just use C**C
 ZarthaxX: it's a pity, toad left some strange cloud here and they got infected or smth
 Scarfield: xD
 The_10x_Engineer: ZarthaxX thanks man, I'll just use that, cause I guess when you do too much adding python slows down 
 Westicles: Astrobyte or Cenobite
 Astrobytes: I'm drinking beer, listening to a Grateful Dead show from 1976 on youtube with a bunch of hippies, talking here, talking on discord and tweaking things in my bot
 ZarthaxX: The_10x_Engineer np, anyway look at the n1 on gitc, he is in python
 Astrobytes: Westicles: heh heh heh
 ZarthaxX: so in this particular case speed isnt a limitation
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes talking on discord with OTHER friendos??!
 Astrobytes: CG friendos! Well 1 is! Out of 3!
 ZarthaxX: ah ah okey
 ZarthaxX: gotta jump on voice chat some day
 ZarthaxX: never talked with struct lol
 Westicles: friendos... No CG for Old Men
 Astrobytes: ehhh, we should get Scarfield and TBali and struct and do one of those weird CG Escape Rooms ZarthaxX
 Astrobytes: Westicles: :D
 Scarfield: checked the other day, there is no new rooms yet
 Astrobytes: Apparently 'coming soon' according to discord
 ZarthaxX: i never complete one damn
 Smelty: sad
 Smelty: i finished the 80s one
 ZarthaxX: i will try to be for next one&#160;:)
 Scarfield: yea, you could click "help" but didnt do anything

 Astrobytes: It's OK, we saw the amusement&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: what's your plan there Jeff06&#160;?  trying to timeout your opponents?
 The_10x_Engineer: ZarthaxX this is an exercise in my mathematical ability, I'll do actual computer science ability later, python sucks he's probably using machine learning :joy:
 Scarfield: trying? he succeded quite well 
 The_10x_Engineer: Unless he's not 
 The_10x_Engineer: which he very well might me
 The_10x_Engineer: be
 The_10x_Engineer: :eyes:
 ZarthaxX: aight you do you haha
 ZarthaxX: i think you can manage with heuristics, if else spaghetti

 Wontonimo: that's 666 1/12 ... better make it 2 months
 therealbeef: not a millennial
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't choose my age...
 The_10x_Engineer: are you sure?
 The_10x_Engineer: just be your ideal age
 BlaiseEbuth: That's a trick, when I get 666y 11m 30d, I celebrate my 666th birthday, and nobody notice. :smiling_imp:
 The_10x_Engineer: :brain:
 BlaiseEbuth: Problem is I have no idea how old I really am... :thinking:
 The_10x_Engineer: How do I print an error in python
 BlaiseEbuth: Just run your code
 The_10x_Engineer: not funny
 The_10x_Engineer: I want to print out an error
 The_10x_Engineer: an error message
 The_10x_Engineer: so I can see an actual output
 BlaiseEbuth: For debugging&#160;?
 The_10x_Engineer: while not making the entire game crash
 The_10x_Engineer: Yes for debugging
 BlaiseEbuth: You have an example of how to do in the default code.
 Wontonimo: print("hello",file=sys.err,flush=True)
 Wontonimo: something like that
 The_10x_Engineer: :thinking:
 The_10x_Engineer: um... alright
 The_10x_Engineer: sys has no attribute err :eyes: 
 Wontonimo: stderr
 The_10x_Engineer: Finally
 Westicles: 10yo engineer, stop being so needy
 Westicles: Making us yanks look bad
 The_10x_Engineer: Well it's fine python was too slow for my way anyway
 Wontonimo: 12 yr
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 The_10x_Engineer: I'll just use C++ so I can actually know what's going on 
 The_10x_Engineer: My god it works
 BlaiseEbuth: You can call me Blaise.
 Wontonimo: oh great Blaise in the sky
 BlaiseEbuth: :thumbsup:
 Smelty: o' great god Blaise, enlighten me with your wisdom
 BlaiseEbuth: Beer is the answer.
 Wontonimo: and it isn't just a morning drink anymore
 BlaiseEbuth: Never been&#160;! :scream:
 Smelty: :0
 Wontonimo: i have surpassed the Blaise
 Wontonimo: Beer was the answer, oh, and but fixes
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: bug*
 Wontonimo: HAHA. yes, bug fixes
 Wontonimo: so, turns out beer doesn't help with spelling
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: so tru
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix your Balmer pick
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 BlaiseEbuth: Was an internal Microsoft studies, about the correlation between quantity of alcohol drunk by a person and his productivity.
 BlaiseEbuth: The ideal value is called 'The Balmer pick'
 BlaiseEbuth: my bad
 BlaiseEbuth: "peak" in english
 Wontonimo: i like it!  I think this requires more experimentation on my part to find my ideal Balmer peak
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 Wontonimo: well, the main change I made that has got me a bit higher in the leaderboard is to assume only my bot has boosts.
 Wontonimo:  Weird, I know, but it seems liked my bot was being overly defensive thinking the others have lots of boosts
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. You're a few places above.
 Wontonimo: i supposed it could be reverse computed from the derivative of the velocity of the other bots (taking into account collisions)  
 BlaiseEbuth: "derivative of the velocity"... :thinking:
 Wontonimo: aka acceleration 
 BlaiseEbuth: One of us is far above his Balmer peak.
 Wontonimo: being fancy ... "change in velocity" hows that?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmmm...
 Wontonimo: on a straight path, your velocity will be v0 * 0.85 + v1, which if you are not boosting will be a maximum of v0*.85+100
 Wontonimo: if you notice another bot exceed that, they either boosted or were bumped 
 Wontonimo: right?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah I get the idea.
 Wontonimo: i'm not going to implement it.
 Wontonimo: *if* I was going to do something else it would be to write a subroutine to detect when there is no hope in catching up, and so switch tactics to try and make the opponent time out
 Wontonimo: maybe
 BlaiseEbuth: Difficult to know exactly what happened when there is collision...
 Wontonimo: do you track or handle other bots boost?
 Wontonimo: i'm grasping at straws here
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope... I'm not at this stage. ^^'
 Wontonimo: i'm out.  Good luck!
 BlaiseEbuth: :wave:
 quyen0w0: hi
 BlaiseEbuth: o/
 solution.cpp: that was the most frustrating clash of code ive played

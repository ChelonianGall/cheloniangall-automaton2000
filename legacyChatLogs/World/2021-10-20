 Thorcode: what do you want to say&#160;? J.Sej
 derjack: i dont know
 XenoDuck: I"m completely new to coding and hesitating between python, c++ and javascript. I want to be an electronic engineer, which language do you guys recommend?
 Uljahn: not js
 XenoDuck: lol ok thanks
 XenoDuck: I guess I'll start with python since it seems easier than c++
 TheBlueBias: not python
 XenoDuck: bruh
 XenoDuck: why
 Uljahn: python is ok for EE
 Uljahn: im EE myself
 XenoDuck: oooo
 XenoDuck: and what do you think I should learn first? ofc I will learn other languages later too
 derjack: python EE?
 Uljahn: if you start with c++, your knowledge would be much deeper
 XenoDuck: ok
 XenoDuck: I will take your advice
 XenoDuck: thanks man
 Thorcode: I start with Python first then will learn C++
 Uljahn: also for engineering in python you should consider lerning scipy and numpy
 Uljahn: *learning
 XenoDuck: sounds interesting
 XenoDuck: I'll see what scipy and numpy do and then choose
 Uljahn: that's where c++ and python blend together
 Thorcode: how could this code check harshard number 
 Thorcode: print('ftarlusee'[int(N:=input())%sum(map(int,N))&lt;1::2]) 
 Thorcode: do you know how it work Uljahn?
 Uljahn: yes
 Uljahn: walrus operator and slicing
 Thorcode: alot of new knowledge
 Thorcode: 'ftarlusee' what does this do?
 Uljahn: it takes even or odd chars from the string
 Uljahn: so you get false or true
 Thorcode: oh I was think that it print ftarlusee
 Uljahn: that's what slicing is for
 Thorcode: oh thanks Uljahn
 Thorcode: to do that my code was long&#160;:))

 eulerscheZahl: they give examples but i've never heard about any of them

 eulerscheZahl: clicking a few checkboxes to get your webpage instead of writing code it seems
 Marchete: working remote a challenge?
 Marchete: damn I wish 
 eulerscheZahl: they just keep calling me
 eulerscheZahl: and tomorrow i'll even go to office
 eulerscheZahl: already the 4th time this year
 Marchete: wow, 4 times
 Marchete: in 10 months
 Marchete: monsters!
 dreadylein: unreasonable 
 dreadylein: :D
 derjack: fruit day?
 Westicles: people are still working from home?  that's insane
 eulerscheZahl: "You're over halfway through! Have a GIF break"struct was much faster than me&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: i quit at that point
 eulerscheZahl: "Which positions do you think will be most sought-after in 2022?"how shall I know?
 derjack: 69
 Marchete: going to office, connect to Microsoft to work on cloud, priceless
 Marchete: that's like solving "The descent" with a NN, it works
 Marchete: but a waste of resources and overly complicated
 Wontonimo: :D
 Wontonimo: there should be a badge for that.Solved 5 puzzles with unnecessarily complicated code
 Westicles: keeping people afraid to leave home for 5% of their adult life... priceless
 derjack: look for onboarding NN codes
 eulerscheZahl: hey, they've finally learned not to use checkboxes to ask for your salary, where one ends at X and the other starts at X+1000 (like 41k-60k, 61k-80k, 81k-100k)
 eulerscheZahl: nvm. i thought it's free text but it turned into a dropdown
 Marchete: Hmm, I picked the "I hire tech ppl" at the survey, too many questions :S
 Marchete: and I hire 1 each 2 years :D
 Wontonimo: that's not ppl, that's "person".
 Wontonimo: i made the same mistake Marchete
 eulerscheZahl: couldn't resist and created a bug report on discord
 TheBlueBias: It's very disappointing to still see you contributing to their data masquerade... :disappointed:
 Marchete: hmmmkay :D
 eulerscheZahl: was curious if it's on a relevant topic, not to fuel their next poor choice. but turned out to be unrelated I think
 eulerscheZahl: so i just told them that I prefer whiteboard interviews
 derjack: over blackboard ones?
 Uljahn: nice data poisoning
 Marchete: CG:"Here, you have a full featured platform, ad free"
 Marchete: You:"Cool"
 eulerscheZahl: i'm really fine with pen and paper coding
 Marchete: CG:"Can you fill a survey"
 Marchete: You:"NO"
 TheBlueBias: Neumann, give back his account to Marchete...
 eulerscheZahl: that wasn't even a troll answer
 Marchete: do you prefer whiteboard?
 Wontonimo: i do
 diddykong69: I prefer blackboard
 eulerscheZahl: leads to more discussion I think
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand: i have little to no experience with interviews
 Marchete: in my experience, ppl with shitty CV are outstanding sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: only had a single job interview in my entire life. and that wasn't too technical as it was for a training during the Bachelor studies. Then I just stayed there
 Marchete: I did many job interviews as recruiter. Two guys that I plain would have rejected by CV turned out to be the best
 TheBlueBias: Concerning the survey, even if I didn't have "problems" with CG, I will not answer knowing how the collected data are used...
 Marchete: one had "construction worker" as prior experience...
 Marchete: post a rant on Facebook about that, TheBlueBias
 TheBlueBias: Social networks...
 eulerscheZahl: it will be used for a lengthy report with lots of charts
 eulerscheZahl: and shared via twitter, email, ...as always with these survery
 eulerscheZahl: surveys
 Marchete: so.. a survey?
 Marchete: sounds like one
 TheBlueBias: Yeah and without any contextualization. And openly distributed, shared and quoted by a bunch of management and rh sites...
 TheBlueBias: Like each years. Taking any digit as a fact...

 eulerscheZahl: i think you should elaborate more on your question
 TheBlueBias: How is python "coding"?
 TimothyAlexisVass: What is 75x0? I know 0x76 would be 118 in Base10
 eulerscheZahl: 75 * 0 is 0 i would say
 eulerscheZahl: read the whole thing backwards?
 eulerscheZahl: 0x57
 TheBlueBias: Even knowing it I don't see any swastika...
 Thorcode: I know 0x76 would be 118 in Base10how this happend?
 eulerscheZahl: oh yeah it's backwards. i just solved your reverse

 eulerscheZahl: and convert that
 TimothyAlexisVass: ....
 Thorcode: convert to?
 niluthebear: hex
 eulerscheZahl: ASCII chars
 niluthebear: ord
 TimothyAlexisVass: That's really strange because that's what I tried and it was wrong. But I must have done a typo or something.
 eulerscheZahl: <i>.join(chr(x) for x in eval(s[::-1].replace(' ',',')))</i>
 eulerscheZahl: assuming s holds the input
 Thorcode: oh ok

 Uljahn: search for "packing and unpacking in python"

 Thorcode: palindrome substrings what is this
 Scarfield: palindrome is a string that has the same characters written backwards
 Scarfield: abba, lol, asdfdsa
 Uljahn: guess it could mean a substring of a palindrome or a substring being a palindrome itself, need more context
 Thorcode: oh

 Makea84: several possible solutions, using built-in functions, using loops...
 Thorcode: nvm
 Thorcode: I got it
 3141948: Print(n -1, end=' ')?
 Makea84: if you just want to delete the last white space, best to use lastIndexOf for example

 JHBonarius: So, I was away for like 2 years? More? Are there any good writeups on using ML?
 jacek: i.e. alphazero oware?

 TheBlueBias: As contests.
 dreadylein: @Goblin_Dev maybe its less the coding and more the physics&#160;?
 JHBonarius: @Goblin_Dev "Lead dev" doesn't say much. In my experience it's the guy that doesn't move on to a next job and automatically gets promoted to that position
 eulerscheZahl: wow TheBlueBias. I don't even remember those

 eulerscheZahl: how do they look like?
 JHBonarius: "Let's consider the following sequence of digits where all natural numbers from 1 onwards show up in order." And then shows a range with 0's in it
 3141948: &gt; I also see certification. Is that some job hunting thing?CG certifications can be added to your linked profile, which permits me to make recruiters notice where to find me...

 TheBlueBias: Coc level
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just not interested it giving it a try
 eulerscheZahl: not the part of the platform that i'm here for
 JHBonarius: You also get "n" as input, which you should use to index an array. But it doesn't tell you how you get the array
 JHBonarius: it's impossible to answer
 TheBlueBias: Well, I don't allow myself to criticize something I don't know, so I tested and listened to feedbacks before mocking it... :smirk:

 TheBlueBias: Of course.
 TheBlueBias: I'm "Better than 99% of the pros" in python... :rofl:

 JHBonarius: Seriously. How can I determine the value in a set of 5000 digits, if they don't give me the digits?! Who made these tests?
 TheBlueBias: Can you share a pic JHBonarius?
 JHBonarius: It's against the rules of the test... Already sharing text here is on the edge...
 eulerscheZahl: who reads those rules?
 eulerscheZahl: but yeah, you are right. then don't share it

 TheBlueBias: No certification authority, and no difficulty, except some input/statement problems as JHBonarius said, so what's the value of this "certifications"?
 LidiaParker: &gt;&gt;&lt;
 Makea84: Certification is a way to assure the knowledge, but not an international company certificate it in this case, not the same as Microsoft, CISCO, Oracle or other companies/institutions...
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it's something that you know you are connected to the right website
 Marchete: ..and they earn $$$ with that, too
 eulerscheZahl: the thing you see when you click the lock icon in your address bar
 Marchete: certification here: "this guy knows, I tell you"
 JHBonarius: only if it's certification by an acknowledge authority. CG isn't that. And with these kinds of questions, I don't expect them to be that
 Marchete: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i know. I have a basic AWS certification. if it hasn't expired yet
 Marchete: I have ITIL, yes, my company went crazy
 Marchete: and paid me that course+cert!
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know what that means
 JHBonarius: I recently got a MS C# certification. The quality of those questions wasn't great either... asking really old stuff, whichj nobody uses anymore
 Marchete: other than that, zero cert/courses
 eulerscheZahl: like ArrayList and HashMap? or a bit newer at least?
 Makea84: im just CISCO CNA, but have will try LPIC and OCAP
 JHBonarius: almost
 JHBonarius: Is the C++ STL still compiled without optimizations here?
 eulerscheZahl: pass extra arguments with the "out" keyword. what are named tuples?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, use pragmas and code your own containers
 JHBonarius: out isn't all bad. Things like int.TryParse still use that. It's not the best, but it has it's purpose
 eulerscheZahl: i would dare to day: if MS would define a TryParse today with modern C#, it would have a different signature
 JHBonarius: Would it? it's nice to use it this way in conditional statements
 eulerscheZahl: hm, you can declare the out variable in place now. maybe it wouldn't :thinking:
 JHBonarius: oh great, the CG editor has automatic " and ' completion. that will take some getting used to
 eulerscheZahl: Monaco editor now
 Marchete: why are you that mad? I thought you were a veteran her at CG...
 eulerscheZahl: the same that's used in VS code
 Marchete: here*
 eulerscheZahl: just use your local IDE and copy-paste
 JHBonarius: i'm not mad? I'm just getting used to something different
 eulerscheZahl: the cars here are mad
 Makea84: love cars competition
 Makea84: hahahaa
 eulerscheZahl: i was referring to "mad pod racing"
 Makea84: me too
 eulerscheZahl: oh, can't read nvm
 Makea84: So funny
 eulerscheZahl: "car compilations" is what I read
 eulerscheZahl: thinking of Russian dash cams
 Makea84: hahahaha lol, well im trying to type in english, but im spanish
 Marchete: Madknight can be in both
 Makea84: in fact we have created a simulated competition about cars, we challenge each other in a tournament mode
 jacek: try search race

 Westicles: I wonder if the estate of the Strugatsky brothers might sue over my clash titles...
 jacek: oO
 TheBlueBias: Don't do that jacek. Have you seen your wordcloud?
 jacek: the what
 jacek: Automaton2000 what is wordcloud
 Automaton2000: so if they are good
 TheBlueBias: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/uhvUffM">https://imgur.com/a/uhvUffM</a>
 jacek: oh my
 TheBlueBias: See that big oO that's watching you?
 Westicles: I thought the huh would be bigger
 jacek: no eeyup?
 TheBlueBias: Only jacek logs in this one.
 Astrobytes: it's there
 Astrobytes: inside the 'm' of 'game'
 TheBlueBias: Tried it on the fr chat logs, and that's totaly boring. Anyone has the same bigger words. Too much "little words" in French... Everybody has "de", "et", "le" or such things on top...
 JHBonarius: whoa! storm outside! 
 TheBlueBias: While it's outside...
 Astrobytes: It would be far more disturbing were it inside
 jacek: maybe
 TheBlueBias: Lightning stroke my electric installation some years ago... First (and last) time I saw a flying phone...
 jacek: .O
 JHBonarius: whahaha, it's really been too long... I was wondering why I got so many errors on compiling... turns out I was using gcc instead of g++. :joy:
 Erkus:&#160;;.
 Erkus:&#160;;

 TheMadWalrus: KID
 Erkus: SUSSY BAKA?
 TheMadWalrus: sus!!!
 Astrobytes: TheBlueBias: Yeah lol :D
 TheBlueBias: You're the third most talkative also.
 Scarfield: only third, gotta pump those numbers
 Astrobytes: don't remember what position I was when eulerscheZahl did it last time
 struct: whos the most talkative?
 struct: euler?
 TheBlueBias: Of course
 Scarfield: saw Den skyldige, damn
 Astrobytes: Good right?
 Scarfield: yea, knew nothing of it other than it was a crime/thriller, but great movie
 TheBlueBias: Your's is still interesting ScarXD
 Astrobytes: It's so intense, literally almost from the start, thought ya'd like it&#160;:)
 TheBlueBias: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/eNcPhdq">https://imgur.com/a/eNcPhdq</a>
 Scarfield: its pretty cool how my messages suck, but my word cloud is interesting :p
 JHBonarius: did someone ever thest if the good-old Q3 fast square root is of any use&#160;?
 FinnLongman: :money_mouth:
 Astrobytes: JHBonarious: there are various fast sqrt implementations in use on CG
 Scarfield: its pretty cool that i "remember watching" scenes that was never showed
 Astrobytes: JHBonarius rather
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Right? You practically live the whole movie, yet only over the phone/headset... 
 Astrobytes: So well acted, can't have been easy
 eulerscheZahl: hey, you ran my script again TheBlueBias. and no more smits at #1 of most words?&#160;:(
 JHBonarius: Yeah, I saw some presentation online that the Q3 fast sqrt is slower then modern implementations in libraries. So I was wondering if it's true
 eulerscheZahl: most active users from last time:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee043dc5-d778-44ec-b6b4-9dd4d20d367d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee043dc5-d778-44ec-b6b4-9dd4d20d367d</a>
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: nope, I should scrap to see if there exists someone who is not &gt;99% (less data to store)
 TheBlueBias: Oh right eulerscheZahl. My bad. Smith is first, you're second.
 eulerscheZahl: if we do bad on purpose, what's the lowest we can get?
 TheBlueBias: 52% :3
 UndercoverToad: sounds like a job for me
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 UndercoverToad: but where can I test it? i don't have the languages on my profile page
 Astrobytes: do a puzzle or something
 TheBlueBias: On home perhaps&#160;?
 TheBlueBias: Do onboarding. :grin:
 Scarfield: you have seen 12 angry men i suppose Astrobytes?
 Stilgart: how come I am the 72nd more active while I haven't play on multis since aeons
 Stilgart:&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: i'm gonna copy-paste. euler, solution please!
 UndercoverToad: still no test to take at 3 solved
 TheBlueBias: "Active" Stilgart?
 JHBonarius: have a nice evening, I need to eat
 Stilgart: active player
 Stilgart: see euler's link
 UndercoverToad: chat activity from march2020 to feb2021
 Scarfield: you 2 bonarius
 TheBlueBias: Yeah, chat activity Stilgart
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: The original one yes, is there a good remake?
 UndercoverToad: and you don't need much to reach top100 there
 Stilgart: ho... I was thinking about arena activity for some unknown reason
 Stilgart: (who be nice to have this info)
 Scarfield: not that i know of, just thought about that when watching den skyldige, also only in one room iirc
 Stilgart: would*
 eulerscheZahl: at least I track new bots now
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Yeah, it's also brilliantly done
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: be prepared and defend yourself
 Automaton2000: why don't u have a bot that will be the one
 TheBlueBias: The words you say the much are "puzzle" and "eulerscheZahl" Stilgart ^^
 Stilgart: that's clearly a proof that the word turtle (tortue) is not taken into account
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 TheBlueBias: *On world only
 Stilgart: I almost never speak on #world
 Stilgart: (are you trying to make me spam some turtles&#160;? :p )
 TheBlueBias: On #fr your top word is "de" :3
 UndercoverToad: still no language tests to take
 TheBlueBias: Like almost every one...
 TheBlueBias: Have to wait
 UndercoverToad: gonna play the big puzzles now
 TheBlueBias: tomorrow perhaps
 Stilgart: such words should be blacklisted
 Stilgart: have fun UndercoverToad
 TheBlueBias: Yeah. I'll try with a blacjlist later
 TheBlueBias: -j+k
 Westicles: C# shows now
 TheBlueBias: I can do the test in some awful language. For science.
 Hjax: what is that most active users list euler
 Scarfield: read that as most attractive
 eulerscheZahl: level 10 and still no test. i give up
 Hjax: if thats the case, astrobytes cat is ranked above mine, which is unacceptable :P
 Scarfield: but most active in world chat some time ago
 Westicles: maybe have to click something on the quest map?
 eulerscheZahl: most active in terms of letters written on chat
 Astrobytes: Hjax: hahaha :D
 eulerscheZahl: after removing links
 Hjax: im higher than i thought i would be 
 Astrobytes: that was from a while ago
 TheBlueBias: Ok. I'll take the swift test...
 Hjax: before i vanished.............. hi guys btw :P
 Astrobytes: indeed lol, hi&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait. I was on the start page and not my profile page
 eulerscheZahl: now let's screw up on the test
 TheBlueBias: o/ Hjax long time not saw
 Scarfield: do your worst
 Astrobytes: bad luck on your test!
 TheBlueBias: Oh well. If euler do it...
 Foxwizard5556: yeah i know
 Hjax: i imagine the general consensus from the regulars is that the fall challenge will be boring? 
 TheBlueBias: What challenge?
 Astrobytes: you didn't see what it is?
 Foxwizard5556: really dude that's crazy
 Hjax: i did see, and it looks boring 
 eulerscheZahl: nice, there's an "end test" button. don't even have to open the tasks to fail them
 Scarfield: its a coding escape room
 Hjax: 2 hours of puzzles 
 Scarfield: so not a contest in the usual sense, pretty sad tbh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/2606412cefc02cbda447c2ff8b7ec40d2316234">https://www.codingame.com/profile/2606412cefc02cbda447c2ff8b7ec40d2316234</a>i failed \o/
 Astrobytes: As a 'thing' it's quite fun if you have a nice team. It is not in any way, shape or form a replacement for a bot programming contest
 Astrobytes: imo
 TheBlueBias: "Unknown level"
 eulerscheZahl: for me it says: Score &lt; 1%
 Scarfield: +1 astro
 eulerscheZahl: oh my bad. I have to check the box to show it to everyone
 TheBlueBias: Oh no Scarfield, one astro is enough of them...
 Scarfield: xD
 Hjax: have people stopped running unofficial contests? i had fun doing the PR2 and code of kutulu ones
 Scarfield: only you can summon more anywho
 TheBlueBias: One more xD for the cloud
 Scarfield: CG stopped "supporting" them
 Hjax: how so? 
 Scarfield: "xD cloud"
 eulerscheZahl: last january they discussed some multiplayer of the month or so. just a bit more exposure for 1 game
 eulerscheZahl: might still come
 eulerscheZahl: ask cat needs attention
 Foxwizard5556: what is going on in this
 eulerscheZahl: afk*
 Luigis3: sup 
 Hjax: lol did codingame get some cease and desists? 
 Hjax: CSB is "Mad Pod Racing"
 ja_fica: MSmits
 ja_fica: Can you share you TT code please?
 Scarfield: they are changing many others to avoid copyright issues, started since coderpad bought CG afaik
 ja_fica: on C4, its amazing
 Foxwizard5556: why do you guys spam so much. it's like a cloud of mice fighting.
 jacek: for all you know, he may be just printing those win/loss
 Foxwizard5556: ha ha nice one
 Shalds: Hello, in php gmp_abs() no work&#160;? 
 Foxwizard5556: i thought it was error-code error error
 ja_fica: Have anyone tried brusts of minimax on MCTS?
 Foxwizard5556: no not really
 Hjax: bursts of minimax? 
 ja_fica: yes
 jacek: mcts solver is kind of negamax eh
 ja_fica: batchs of 8 states solves
 ja_fica: mtcs solves 1 state per complete rollout
 Hjax: i think some people do a low depth minimax search as part of EPT 
 Foxwizard5556: yes batchs of 7 states 
 ja_fica: for example
 Foxwizard5556: i thought that was what that was
 ja_fica: and propagate its result
 Foxwizard5556: oh ok
 Astrobytes: Foxwizard5556: keep going and get a kick
 Foxwizard5556: nice job
 ja_fica: minimax with deth requires evaluation function
 Hjax: mcts with ept also uses an evaluation function 
 struct: but wouldnt mcts with ept minimax also need an eval?
 ja_fica: yes
 ja_fica: I was talking without eval or ept
 struct: minmax without eval?
 ja_fica: burst of solving K states at each rollout
 ja_fica: mcts solver but solving K state and propagating that K states
 ja_fica: it should solve states much faster in my head
 TheBlueBias: Astrobytes be nice, he's only 3 years old.
 struct: but you need to limit the depth right?
 Hjax: mcts solver just propagates any terminal nodes it runs into as it builds its tree, i dont think i understand your question 
 ja_fica: imagine you use regular minimax with TT and no time limit
 ja_fica: you search from end to start
 jacek: ja_fica <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/mcts-minimax_hybrids_final.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/mcts-minimax_hybrids_final.pdf</a>
 struct: I understand but solving a state isnt trivial
 struct: how deep will you need to go?
 ja_fica: but you limit the states solved so you can propagate visits and leverage from MCTS heuristic
 jacek: shallow minimax will be beneficial if solved states are close to each other
 ja_fica: yes
 ja_fica: exacly
 jacek: see the paper i linked
 ja_fica: would it turn a MCTS solver much faster to solve?
 jacek: depends on game. they tried shallow minimax for different parts of mcts
 ja_fica: im saying this because using TT in there would definitely have less colisions
 jacek: not only in rollout or expansion
 ja_fica: I was talking burst after expansion
 ja_fica: so that UCT formulas works nice for the visited states
 Ceki: I think I'm too bad at this
 Ceki: I can't solve even one exercise
 Rich_Engler: What do you do when you fin a clash of code that is computationally impossible to complete?
 Thyl: Why LINE RACER and not tron&#160;?
 Ceki: you asking me Rich_Engler?
 Rich_Engler: Anyone really.
 jacek: Rich_Engler all clashes are possible to compute
 Ceki: yet I didn't solve even one
 Ceki: hahaha
 Rich_Engler: The test cases in this clash include numbers that exceed 4.2 billion!
 eulerscheZahl: it's not LINE RACER Thyl. it's Line Racing
 Thyl: But why&#160;???
 Rich_Engler: Even trying to convert to 64 bit numbers the test cases exceeded the limit
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/updates-of-old-puzzles-and-games/193102">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/updates-of-old-puzzles-and-games/193102</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i can assure you: the list is longer than the few that have been renamed so far (last crusade, skynet, tron, csb)
 eulerscheZahl: :sob:
 Rich_Engler: So in exactly what programming languages can you compute numbers over 64 bits?
 eulerscheZahl: in all. turing completeness
 Hjax: python has native support for arbitrarily sized numbers iirc
 eulerscheZahl: yes it does
 eulerscheZahl: so does Haskell
 eulerscheZahl: C# and Java have BigInteger classes
 eulerscheZahl: pari/gp is great at handling huge numbers
 Stilgart: gmp is enough for C and its derivatives
 struct: ruby shuld be able to handle it
 jacek: perfect for reverse clash <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/seluappendix">https://twitter.com/seluappendix</a>
 jacek: "trained" by GA, at least it doesn't lose on unseen maps <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/1le4if">https://streamable.com/1le4if</a>
 KiwiTae: o/
 niluthebear: o/
 Wontonimo: that GA does the job, "but at what cost".
 jacek: theres some fault. always converges to -18 or 18 degress :thinking:
 struct: never 0?
 jacek: or 0, but its always one sided
 MSmits: hey guys. I generalized my c4 solver, it takes all sizes between 4 and 11 now for width and height. Been checking the results with: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 jacek: ja_fica ^
 MSmits: biggest solved so far is 6x6. I don't think it's super efficient, but it works
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/0ZIjkMD">https://imgur.com/a/0ZIjkMD</a>
 MSmits: is ja_fica doing this too? I missed the conversation earlier
 ja_fica: Im not sure
 jacek: he wanted TT code from you
 ja_fica: ha yes, I have coded my own version, I thin I will submit it to arena
 ja_fica: but I lost a lot of rollouts
 MSmits: you mean a hashed version?
 MSmits: TT?
 ja_fica: I do a very not efficient hash mush probably enough
 MSmits: see if you solve earlier
 MSmits: do you use your own or a library?
 MSmits: like unordered set or some sucvh
 ja_fica: my own
 ja_fica: no, I use array
 MSmits: ah ok good
 ja_fica: I solve it early but I need a better opening book
 MSmits: use it to generate one&#160;:)
 ja_fica: good idea
 MSmits: you need a good bot to make a good book
 MSmits: if i dont have a good bot for a game i dont even try it
 MSmits: thats why i never made a book for breakthrough
 ja_fica: I have to admit that my bot is a little unstable
 MSmits: your bot is good enough for sure
 MSmits: my bot is around darkhorse's  strength
 MSmits: (booklesS)
 MSmits: well this was before the TT, but i doubt it matters much
 struct: my bot sucks vs books
 jacek: if you have weak bot, just give it more time to think. ezpz.
 struct: the books destroy me
 ja_fica: fk it, I will submit to arena, hope it works fine
 MSmits: can always resubmit old version
 ja_fica: true
 MSmits: especially if it pulls me down, then the old version is preferable
 ja_fica: your book is much better
 ja_fica: I finnaly understand how to transform to Chinese caracters
 ja_fica: I use python instead of C#
 MSmits: in 4x7 c4 the corner move is a draw and center wins
 ja_fica: and only chinese caracters from 20000 to 20000+(2^14)
 MSmits: center loses sry
 MSmits: so center is defnitely not always best
 MSmits: why from 20000?
 MSmits: you can start at like 192 or something
 MSmits: just have to skip maybe 2 of them
 ja_fica: I have some invalid caracters, dont know why
 MSmits: yeah there are 2 afaik
 MSmits: paragraph separator and another separator
 MSmits: line separator
 ja_fica: in my case a have around 1000 invalid characters in python, don't know why
 ja_fica: myy bot is getting reckt
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: maybe it's different in C#
 ja_fica: yes, 14 bits is enough for me
 MSmits: ja_fica be careful about judging vs some players. Some of them are super deterministic
 jacek: or utf16-be vs utf16-le
 MSmits: i also use 14 bits, but i think the 20k+ chars use more space
 MSmits: some count as 2 i think?
 jacek: ~50k+ count as 2
 MSmits: hmm i thought it was sooner, but allright, i never bothered to check
 ja_fica: i use from 20k to 36k so its fine
 MSmits: yeah, its not like you need the space
 MSmits: unless you're also doing NN
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 ja_fica: my bot is really unstable because I keep expanding it, destroying the content of the TT
 ja_fica: I should apply an evaluation function
 ja_fica: with NN, thats what Im going to do
 MSmits: sounds like a fun experiment
 ja_fica: One interesting challenge is transforming the weigths of a convolution neural network (Conv2D) into pure C++ code with no libraries and auto-vectorization. I did it yesterday, its amazing that I can now use to for robotics
 jacek: convs :scream:
 ja_fica: 6 for cycles
 ja_fica: all inside one another
 ja_fica: I use single dimentional to all vectors
 ja_fica: so I don't ever need to flatten the array
 ja_fica: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/dWjZ5sz">https://ibb.co/dWjZ5sz</a>
 ja_fica: I would pay 100€ for this code some months ago
 jacek: is this from some paper?
 ja_fica: no, I developed myself
 ja_fica: I wanted to do this a some weeks ago
 jacek: :money_with_wings:
 ja_fica: for whole code to deploy any keras model into auto generated c++ code (3 scripts, 1 python, 2 c++), 60€ if you want xD
 ja_fica: Im programming the easy MaxPool and AvgPool as well

 CrispyBacon1764: is there a file explorer/a way to make more files?
 CrispyBacon1764: in the editor
 Westicles: sure, go to bash and type ls
 Thorcode: in mime type I must ouput the q and  n in type of file?
 Thorcode: why the last testcase has 9999 it make my code die:(((((((((((((
 Thorcode: mime = {ext.lower(): tp for ext, tp in (input().split() for _ in range(n))}
 Thorcode: how this could happend in the code there is not ext
 Thorcode: no
 bminnix:&#160;?  It's defining it by the split.
 bminnix: mime becomes a dict holding the lowercase extension and the mime type that goes with it.
 bminnix: For each of the n lines passed to it after q has been presented.
 bminnix: I see you got 100 on it, so you figured it out, lol.
 TechnoBot: Stop invite me Thorcode
 Thorcode: thanks bminix
 Thorcode: Why TechnoBot?

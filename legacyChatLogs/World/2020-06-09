 hjhjhjhjhjhjhjhj: join clash plz
 AbundantPuddle: It wasn't comparitive, it was assigning.
 AbundantPuddle: It was in regards to MostComplicatedUsername's comment.
 hydroglicerol: what is the highest level you can reah and is 11 considerd good for 1 week?
 hydroglicerol: is noone up at 2:16?
 WINWINWIN: Definitely hydroglicerol
 hydroglicerol: ahh
 WINWINWIN: lvl 11 in one week is excellent
 hydroglicerol: what is the highest?
 WINWINWIN: Not sure what the highest somone did in 1 week is, but eulerscheZahl is at lvl 52
 hydroglicerol: ahh wel back to the grind thanks for the encouragement
 LelouchVC2: C++ definitely runs slower on this site
 LelouchVC2: I just did a CoC in C# and it ran through those tests like they were butter
 hydroglicerol: what is the anime in your pic if it is anime?
 WINWINWIN: LelouchVC2 even if it does run slower, it is not noticeable by running test cases
 hydroglicerol: and yes C++ is definatley slower here
 hydroglicerol: I feel notacible lag when I use it
 hydroglicerol: but I never really use it
 hydroglicerol: I only used it to give that nintendo sponcerd puzzle a try
 hydroglicerol: which was meh
 jacek: LelouchVC2 do you have optmization pragmas?
 struct: It's a must for CoC
 WINWINWIN: I still dont understand how he notices a 1 ms difference in test cases
 struct: he probably is talking about compilation time
 NicatSadiqov: I am not a good speller. Sometimes I mix up the spelling of words and sometimes I even forget to put periods. Please count the number of words I have misspelled and the number of periods I have missed.Input
 NicatSadiqov: is it now hard question
 WINWINWIN: CoC puzzle?
 NicatSadiqov: task require that find wrong spelling words and missin periods
 NicatSadiqov: missing periods
 NicatSadiqov: number of them
 NicatSadiqov: is it possible in c++
 NicatSadiqov: i can fund number of periods put wrongly 
 NicatSadiqov: but i dont know that of words
 Tiramon: omg old code is always a mess, looked a pr2 and shortend the code by 1/4 without changing anything on the result
 Nerchio: :D nice
 Tiramon: hm somehow it is even working better, seems like i had a bug and fixed it 
 Tiramon: is something broken on submit right now? it does show me alot of latest battles but no progress in latest battles or leaderboard ... i'm listed as stable while i just submitted [CG]Thibaud
 Tiramon: currently submitted pr2
 Nerchio: idk it was working for me but it broke a few times in the last days
 Nerchio: so maybe it happened again ;p
 Tiramon: you are listed as computing with progress ...
 Nerchio: i have so many bugs in my code that are off-by-1 mistakes
 Nerchio: :x
 Nerchio: yeah i just submitted so its possible
 Tiramon: also after 80 battles my rank still didn't change ...
 Nerchio: sometimes it's slow ;p
 Tiramon: never seen it that slow before
 LelouchVC2: The anime in my picture is Code Geass
 LelouchVC2: And Idk what to optimizations I can enable on Codingame
 LelouchVC2: I used C# and those tests flew by. With C++, it's slower.
 [CG]Thibaud: it has been reported on Discord too
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't know what's happening. These random freeze/slowness of submits are not normal
 Tiramon: that's what i expected, i started a forum thread about it
 Tiramon: and as i said it is not just slow, it is just as i never submited...
 jacek: this is what you get for organizing contests
 Tiramon: oh nice now there are only 8 multiplayer games listed at bot-programming ...
 Tiramon: only the ones  havn't started yet
 leojean890: I encountered the same problem recently&#160;: you can see new fights after submitting but you have to wait for 1 hour before the leaderboard update
 leojean890: in bot-programming you have 2 categories&#160;: already and not already begun multiplayers are split in 2 distinct parts of the web page
 Tiramon: 1h passed nothing changed
 Nerchio: yea :9
 leojean890: I think that it can be more sometimes depending on the situation.. Do many people submit in the same time in PR2&#160;? and there are no leagues .. Problems may be the same than those encountered at the beginning of the PAC contest
 Nerchio: it updated i think
 Tiramon: at least it changed
 Tiramon: 1,5h
 Tiramon: at least this submit it is updating
 Astrobytes: I had to just give up on it last night
 AntiSquid: give up what?
 AntiSquid: leaderboard stuck again?
 Nerchio: not for me i think
 Tiramon: damn i have a bug in my new distance calculation
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's been sticking a lot AntiSquid

 WINWINWIN: Hey Tiramon is your NN going well?
 Tiramon: did try it again by now, currently wasted a lot of time on social stuff and during my vacation i will spend most of the time on the nanodegree and renovate my son's room
 Tiramon: maybe i find some time to train it again or try a different setup
 Tiramon: *didn't
 AntiSquid: "lower ranks" lol
 WINWINWIN: Hope it works, would like to see how NN compares to minimax.
 AntiSquid: same issue with top 100 even in legend, no precision
 AntiSquid: if you only top 3 is taken into account, then might as well throw the ranking out the window
 Tiramon: 'lower ranks' is for you everything &gt; 10&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: &gt;5
 AntiSquid: don't ask me Tiramon, i didn't post that quote
 WINWINWIN: To train a NN dont you just need to identify a set of datapoints?
 WINWINWIN: Are there any sites with papers on NNs
 WINWINWIN:&#160;?
 inoryy: what are you training it on, Tiramon?
 Tiramon: oware
 Tiramon: has a simple state and action set
 Tiramon: so my DQN should learn nicly
 Tiramon: took some time to avoid late game invalid actions, but last weights learned it after i kicked it a few times
 Tiramon: oh nice ... you did it to deepmind?
 AntiSquid: deepmind should try to use their skills to find a cure for COVID :pkaggle has a COVID related challenge

 jimmyjansen93: Hey guys im trying to compete in CSB, but im running into a wall with my "AI". I am trying to look through the documentation provided in the challenge and both smitsimax and genetic algorithm sound very interesting. For both I understand the theory of how they are supposed to work, but I am having trouble understanding the implementation side. Without spoiling anything, can anyone help me understand the practical side of this?
 WINWINWIN: jimmyjansen93
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a> is an excellent documentation on how to practically apply a GA
 WINWINWIN: Feel free to ask if you have any doubts
 CommanderCero: What do you mean. Both algorithms rely on an simulation, meaning you probably have a class or methods that mimic the original game. In the best case you have a method like "step(action)" that advances your game forward one step.You can then pass the actions to the step function, which are provided by the algorithm you use
 jimmyjansen93: Thanks @WINWINWIN maybe going through that one again will help me more than the first time I read it
 Astrobytes: Please be gentle with our poor bots MSmits :P
 Illedan: oware? :P
 WINWINWIN: jimmyjansen93 this is inoryy`s functional search bot
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/inoryy/csb-ai-starter">https://github.com/inoryy/csb-ai-starter</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah :D
 WINWINWIN: It is a fully functional bot written in C++
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes working on PR2?
 Astrobytes: No, working on my Oware eval today
 WINWINWIN: Msmits crushing everyone?
 Illedan: Not 100%
 Astrobytes: Not sure what changes he's made other than using tanh
 jimmyjansen93: Thanks so much @WINWINWIN seems like that will already help me a lot 
 Astrobytes: jimmyjansen93 Just make sure you don't blindly submit the starter bot
 jimmyjansen93: of course 
 WINWINWIN: jimmyjansen93 you cannot apply that yet, you are only in Silver
 jimmyjansen93: I am anyway writing JS, so blind copy is not in it for me, but I am looking for practical examples of how to implement genetic algorithm as the theory is a bit to much theory for me and I cannot seem to grasp it 
 jimmyjansen93: yea, thats fine, I will get to gold 
 WINWINWIN: In gold, a lot of new info is given allowing for a GA.
 WINWINWIN: In Silver you dont know all of the checkpoints
 Astrobytes: the Magu s document will help you, there's also a GA tutorial (in python) on tech.io
 jimmyjansen93: Ah I had plans to log the points and for the second and third round optimize my routes for them
 WINWINWIN: jimmyjansen93 just get to gold in 10 mins using the targ - 3vel
 WINWINWIN: dont think GA is possible in Silver without knowing CPs, you cannot evaluate a solution
 jimmyjansen93: targ - 3vel? what is that?
 WINWINWIN: "Magic formula" for CSB, takes all the way to gold
 WINWINWIN: target.x - 3 * pod.vx
 Matrix007: heloo guys need some help
 WINWINWIN: target.y - 3 * pod.vy
 WINWINWIN: Yes Matrix007?
 Matrix007: do u know where i could find the problems for clash of code
 Matrix007: are they random
 Matrix007: i want a solution for a particular problem
 WINWINWIN: They are given randomly in the IDE
 Matrix007: is there any collection of those where i cold check
 WINWINWIN: Matrix007 are you in that clash now?
 Matrix007: no
 Matrix007: i did it a week ago
 Matrix007: it was the code to print a window
 WINWINWIN: Ahh. It is not possible to find the solution
 Matrix007: oh
 Matrix007: ok guuys
 Matrix007: i just wanted to check whether i had understood the problem correctly since it was having only one example
 struct: Do you remember keywords from the clash?
 struct: or part of the statement
 Astrobytes: Matrix007 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/search/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/search/</a>
 Astrobytes: Search for it there, you can then work through the problem to find the answer in your own time
 WINWINWIN: Wow
 Matrix007: thanks so much astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Hey thank euler&#160;;)
 Matrix007: is that project euler?or an username
 Astrobytes: username, it's his app
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/3525dbd0ddde1375af211b2469bebc73fc7">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/3525dbd0ddde1375af211b2469bebc73fc7</a>
 WINWINWIN: Im guessing that this was the puzzle you wanted Matrix007
 AntiSquid: project euler was there before euler's number, right Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: and i went to bed
 Matrix007: wait a bit guys the websites are not opening
 Matrix007: probably my internet
 Matrix007: yeah thats the one winwinwin 
 Matrix007: thank u
 WINWINWIN: np
 Matrix007: so i am bit new here i cant focus on a problem to think its logic or its takin me more time any tips?
 Matrix007: BTW i know its gonna be practice but i just cant get myself to sit 
 Matrix007: that fire inside me
 Matrix007: how to kindle?
 Matrix007: dont think it as some motivational ques
 eulerscheZahl: a random ping by Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Well, it wasn't random
 eulerscheZahl: time to finally push a fix to that broken search for badly formatted HTML
 eulerscheZahl: the problem is that for user contributions the uploader has control over the HTML. so many ways to screw it up :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the search is part of the GET parameter now, i broke the link from above :imp:
 Astrobytes: lol, and the CG HTML is weird too right?
 Astrobytes: As in what's allowed etc
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, some filtering
 MSmits: hey astrobytes. I did a cg bench test 400 games vs my arena version, got  87% winrate. Then I submitted it and it was far weaker than Robo and Recurse
 MSmits: meaning it was far weaker than my old version
 MSmits: so i need to fit the param not against myself, but agains tthem
 MSmits: I should have known
 Astrobytes: Aha, that would explain it
 MSmits: crazy overfitting in this game
 Astrobytes: This was just your tanh right
 MSmits: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and then a 4th player appears and beats you because of your fitting
 MSmits: with a param setting that gave 87% winrate vs the old version, losing only 1 in 30 games
 Astrobytes: lol, definitely makes for a tempting submit eh
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I think this game is like this because the statespace is so small
 MSmits: so good bots will play nearly perfectly
 Matrix007: what are bots
 MSmits: a small param change may lead your bot to make 1 extra mistake or prevent 1 and that could change everything
 Matrix007: npcs?
 Astrobytes: Well, perfect CG play at least
 MSmits: nah i mean near perfect play
 MSmits: like, you make 50 moves and 3 of them are wrong
 MSmits: the others are perfect
 Astrobytes: Yeah, true 
 Astrobytes: And yeah, I am fully aware of the parameter sensitivity :P
 MSmits: wrong meaning, the solved game value changes from win to draw or draw to loss
 Astrobytes: Yeah I gotcha
 MSmits: k
 MSmits: I think maybe simple games that are near solvable have this property
 Astrobytes: Sounds reasonable, my game theory isn't good enough to confirm your hypothesis though&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah it's just an idea
 MSmits: I am hoping I will be able to fit the param to get the same strength as my old version, because I really like the sigmoid
 Astrobytes: It's useful yeah, but you do have to do some tweaking
 MSmits: apparently so
 MSmits: btw... Othello might be a good game for CG
 MSmits: anyone suggest this yet?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: but who has time to make it&#160;? :p
 Astrobytes: When? I didn't see that
 MSmits: We'll force it on struct
 Astrobytes: lol, poor guy
 AntiSquid: could use checkers as a base to quickly create it, but no mood
 MSmits: nah, let someone do it who would like to create a game for CG and has fun doing it
 MSmits: it does seem easy 
 Astrobytes: Othello or making a game?
 MSmits: making othello
 struct: Hello
 MSmits: Othello is a hard game to play as a human
 MSmits: hi struct
 Astrobytes: *a wild struct appears*
 AntiSquid: disagree with that MSmits
 struct: isnt it solved though?
 Astrobytes: Haven't played Othello in years
 Astrobytes: Doesn't matter for CG imo struct
 MSmits: It's hard to imagine future positions with Othello
 MSmits: harder than chess
 AntiSquid: more like machine and human approach are different
 MSmits: blind chess is easier than blind othello
 MSmits: because the board transforms a LOT
 struct: well blind chess doesnt seem hard for top players though
 struct: But I see what you are saying
 MSmits: its not, but blind othello is
 MSmits: it's like uttt in that it seems chaotic
 struct: Do you think 8x8
 AntiSquid: where did you get this idea from that blind othello has to be harder?
 struct: or bigger?
 MSmits: a paper
 AntiSquid: 12x12 imo
 MSmits: 8x8 hasnt been solved yet
 MSmits: i think
 MSmits: nearly though
 AntiSquid: 8x8 is solved afaik and 10x10 is partially solved
 MSmits: really?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Othello#Othello_8_x_8">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Othello#Othello_8_x_8</a>
 struct: Doesnt seem solved according to wiki
 MSmits: no its not
 MSmits: and the complexity is greater than checkers
 AntiSquid: i checked multiple sources a while ago
 MSmits: could be wiki is outdated
 MSmits: but still if checkers works on CG, so will othello 8x8 
 MSmits: far more complex than oware as well
 MSmits: the only reason oware abapa isnt solved is because of the loops
 MSmits: but it has a tiny statespace
 struct: I guess I can take a look
 MSmits: it was just an idea though
 MSmits: dont stress yourself&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: but computers can beat humans according to this source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/1002/">https://xkcd.com/1002/</a>
 MSmits: yeah that i knew
 eulerscheZahl: which says that humans beat computers at Go
 MSmits: thats definitely odl
 MSmits: old
 MSmits: alpha go lee beat the best human
 eulerscheZahl: from january 2012
 MSmits: then alpha go zero beat alpha go lee 100%
 MSmits: but i guess most go bots cant beat good humans
 MSmits: alpha zero is a pretty heavy machine
 AntiSquid: "computers may never outplay humans" section - lol what?
 MSmits: yeah i dont get that
 eulerscheZahl: it's XKCD. thorough research mixed with total nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/485/">https://xkcd.com/485/</a>

 struct: So all pieces that are between 2 pieces flip?

 struct: if they belong to opoonent?=
 eulerscheZahl: you
 eulerscheZahl: and these flip can cause more flips
 eulerscheZahl: you =&gt; yes
 eulerscheZahl: i'm stupid
 AntiSquid: yes struct lots of /flips
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: recursive flipping
 inoryy: flip reCurse?
 Astrobytes: lol "Brian Greene knitting furiously" :D
 struct: Game doesn't seem hard to port
 struct: I'll see what I can do
 struct: Not sure about board size though
 struct: I need feedback
 AntiSquid: 10x10 min&#160;!?
 struct: 100x100
 struct: ah wait cant
 RoboStac: choose each dimension randomly between 2 and 65. Also don't tell the player how big the board is, so there is an element of fog of war
 AntiSquid: lol why&#160;! 
 Astrobytes: And no statement.
 eulerscheZahl: and change the board size during the game
 Astrobytes: Could be an official CG contest.
 AntiSquid: make the stones rock paper scissors types
 AntiSquid: or crosswords&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Each square is a UTTT board
 eulerscheZahl: now you are about to exceed the timelimit
 Astrobytes: Hm, OK. Stones have PCR physics
 eulerscheZahl: you have to trow colored pillows on a grid to place your actions. but there is some random deviation in your aiming so you can't be sure where you place your action
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUfnJKLoNQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXUfnJKLoNQ</a>
 AntiSquid: any RAIC contest around the corner or did i miss it?
 Astrobytes: lol, nice how you thought of RAIC when random aiming was mentioned
 eulerscheZahl: nothing announced yet
 Astrobytes: Haha yes, that should be the CG version eulerscheZahl :D
 Astrobytes: Why does that exist!
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 Astrobytes: Fair
 Astrobytes: They should have this in parks. Like shuffleboard
 Astrobytes: And giant chess/checkers
 AntiSquid: giant chess pieces are easier to grab&#160;?
 JBM: and more fun to steal
 eulerscheZahl: they have giant chess checkers where i live
 JBM: you live in an honest country
 eulerscheZahl: they call it manhole cover
 AntiSquid: steal and place them next to your garden dwarfs JBM&#160;?
 JBM: i can't imagine it lasting long around here&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Nor here
 JBM: don't have the garden dwarfs
 JBM: i don't think they'd be compatible with *her*
 AntiSquid: well right now the protesters would probably spray paint "this game is racist" on it
 Astrobytes: Round here the kids would set fire to them, and breathe in the fumes. Beats the wheelie bins they usually use...
 AntiSquid: i thought random fires were more specific to Ireland
 AntiSquid: walk through the park and notice lots of random patches of burnt stuff
 Astrobytes: No, our parks and general area are full of those
 Astrobytes: *the area in general
 ZombieGhost_f5c9: you need to pay for hints??
 JBM: how much?
 JBM: mine are cheaper
 Astrobytes: CG Premium Account
 ZombieGhost_f5c9: i dont have option "hints" anymore
 ZombieGhost_f5c9: ah okay
 Uljahn: you need premium account, like Automaton2000 has
 Automaton2000: but i don't know which one to use
 JBM: multi-premium
 AntiSquid: filthy rich
 Nerchio: report automaton to cg multiple account
 ZombieGhost_f5c9: where is this shit
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN must be his alt
 JBM: maybe that's one of the perks of going premium
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem?
 AntiSquid: your alts! delete them!
 AbundantPuddle: What does Applied Laser Technologies have to do with CG?
 AbundantPuddle: chiikoneko I'm not sure if you'll read this, but I like your answer there.
 Nerchio: leaderboard dead again i think
 eulerscheZahl: nah, just taking a short nap
 AbundantPuddle: Leaderboards never die, they just decompile.
 Astrobytes: Looking much better so far MSmits
 Astrobytes: As in, like, "holy shit" better
 MSmits: its the old version
 MSmits: but i figured out why the sigmoid failed I think
 Astrobytes: Oh, that explains why it's better
 Astrobytes: What do you think?
 MSmits:  I didnt modifiy the leaderboard version with the sigmoid
 MSmits: but an experimental version i never got to work
 MSmits: apparently the experimental version + sigmoid was overtrained vs the leaderboard version in some inexplicable way
 MSmits: the experimental version opened when i started VS
 MSmits: so i thought that was my best
 Astrobytes: lol, classic mistake
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: so I have some hope maybe the sigmoid will work with the leaderboard version. 
 MSmits: it's a lot less ugly than capping the scores
 MSmits: will try and see if i can fit a param that works well
 Astrobytes: Be more careful next time eh&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 MSmits: damn i forgot how strong this was
 MSmits: and it's really just some param magic
 Astrobytes: Only you forgot. The rest of us have to face it every time we submit :P
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It is a beast of a bot though
 MSmits: yeah, I am really surprised at it. It's hard to find a set of params that works against everyone, i just picked  darkhorse, re curse, robo and agade and hoped it would be representative of "good opponents"
 MSmits: you cant pick too many or it will be too random
 MSmits: it's really top 3... then a huge gap, then the rest
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed. I struggle to fit adequate parameters to cover the whole spectrum of opponents
 Astrobytes: Yup
 Astrobytes: You get halfway through a submit and think "oh, nice" then you get spanked continuously by you 3 for the remaining duration!
 MSmits: yeah, doesnt hurt your rating much, but wastes games
 MSmits: community games dont have that many games on submit, so every game against a player out of range, is a lost game
 MSmits: happens on langtons ant vs redstrike
 MSmits: ridiculously strong
 Astrobytes: Yep. Kinda forces you to try and improve though
 Astrobytes: That ever get fixed?
 MSmits: bug supposedly got fixed, but redstrike doesnt need it to clobber us
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: What does he use?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: I just use mcts with a lot of pruning
 Astrobytes: Still haven't got around to fixing mine yet
 MSmits: I'm in no mans land in langtons ant
 MSmits: player far below and one far above
 Astrobytes: Lonely island
 MSmits: ye
 RAksix: help
 RAksix: Given two numbers a and b, you have to count how many numbers within a range belong to the following categories: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e6516dde-f470-45f5-a0a6-5c37f0f8ccc6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e6516dde-f470-45f5-a0a6-5c37f0f8ccc6</a>
 MSmits: i ran out of ideas for it, but thats good, i dont like it as much as some others
 Astrobytes: *cough* UTTT *cough* :P
 MSmits: uttt has too many ideas, but i would like to let it go for a while, it's just hard :P
 MSmits: RAksix use a&#160;% 3 == 0 to check if a number is divisible by 3
 MSmits: or in your case  Number&#160;% a == 0
 Astrobytes: That's a solution not a hint! :D
 MSmits: or in python:  Number / a == Number // a    though I am not sure that works
 MSmits: oh I guess so&#160;:)
 MSmits: might be the type changes on //
 MSmits: or doesnt it?
 Astrobytes: No idea tbh
 MSmits:&#160;% a == 0 is the usual solution?
 AbundantPuddle: Some of these clashes man... makes me wonder how they passed peer review.
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 MSmits: AbundantPuddle some are crap, but they can be edited i think
 Astrobytes: And yeah, there were issues with approval previously
 MSmits: by someone who has done enough clashes
 Hjax: if we do more unofficial contests it would be nice to give the community multis some more love 
 Astrobytes: and/or use a new contribution
 Astrobytes: thibpat's got loads of suggestions from everyone for future contests now&#160;:)
 Hjax: if we use a new contribution cant we just get it made into an official contest? 
 Hjax: like how ocean of code was?
 Astrobytes: Depends, it's a lot of work
 Astrobytes: And depends on the type of game I guess
 Astrobytes: If it's got fog of war and 65 million inputs it should be fine :P
 Hjax: why do they like fog of war so much
 Astrobytes: No clue man, no clue
 jacek: smits dropped in ranking?
 Astrobytes: Resubmit after failed tanh
 jacek: failed? i thought he was winning muchly
 Astrobytes: No, "apparently the experimental version + sigmoid was overtrained vs the leaderboard version in some inexplicable waythe experimental version opened when i started VSso i thought that was my best"
 MSmits: leaderboard version + sigmoid does much better than experimental + sigmoid
 MSmits: not yet better than old version, but maybe if i find a good param value
 jacek: is CG lagging today?
 Astrobytes: Chat? Yeah. Sometimes leaderboards freezing too
 YurkovAS: leaderboard not work
 Astrobytes: Again.
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Astrobytes: I have no idea what that means
 jacek: quite old and obscure meme
 struct: ok I was mixing reversi and othello
 jacek: theyre the same o.O
 struct: no
 jacek: w00t
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bonaludo.com/2016/02/18/reversi-and-othello-two-different-games-do-you-know-their-different-rules/">https://bonaludo.com/2016/02/18/reversi-and-othello-two-different-games-do-you-know-their-different-rules/</a>
 jacek: oh my
 JKSTUDIOS2020: what a link&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Submits stuck again?
 Tuo: I just got into Coders Strike Back legend league but my submit is not doing anything&#160;:( cant get a rank
 Astrobytes: Yes, stuck again
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:) will come up in some time
 Astrobytes: minutes... hours... days...
 struct: cg broke again?
 MostComplicatedUsername: struct didn't you do yavalath?
 struct: yes
 MostComplicatedUsername: Says by undefined
 struct: Yeah I deleted that account
 MostComplicatedUsername: ohhh
 MSmits: struct, if you're going to do othello, do the "real" othello that is used in international competitions
 MSmits: seems more interesting
 Hjax: the leaderboard really hates fun 
 WINWINWIN: Anyone know euler`s website to find codingame puzzles?
 Hjax: yay the leaderboard updated 
 Hjax: and i gained a ton of ranks
 Hjax: rank 47 in pr2 now 
 WINWINWIN: nice Hjax&#160;:)
 Hjax: my bot is really weak on the super large maps 
 Hjax: but i think its quite good on the medium sized ones 
 eulerscheZahl: WINWINWIN I do
 WINWINWIN: :D euler what is it?
 struct: yeah msmits dont worry, my only question is grid size. but that wont matter for now I guess
 WINWINWIN: I need to retrieve my CoC puzzle to make a few changes
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 jacek: what is "real" othello?
 WINWINWIN: thanks euler
 jacek: i think i mostly fixed my mcts with ept. still weaker but not by much
 jacek: i had int score in node and i was putting float there...
 Astrobytes: lol, I made that exact mistake early on :D
 eulerscheZahl: "real othello" = start in the center, always place next to other stone, isn't it?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, otherwise it's optional. I think
 jacek: so it differs mostly with starting?
 Astrobytes: *optional in reversi
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Astrobytes: There's a special place in Hell for people who reduce my Oware score jacek :P
 noobyy: anyone know some fortran?
 eulerscheZahl: C at the beginning of a line to start a comment. that's all my fortran knowledge
 noobyy: welp you can get paid a lot if you know it&#160;:^) 
 eulerscheZahl: but maintaining old code is no fun
 jacek: yet fortran is not on the list in CG&#160;:&lt;
 struct: What is fortran used for?
 Astrobytes: You can get paid a lot digging the roads at night, what's your point?
 noobyy: used in banks. It's very close to assembly in that it's very efficient if it's written well
 eulerscheZahl: or for blackmailing
 noobyy: you can get paid more doing fortran - I guarantee it 
 eulerscheZahl: and obviously D is much faster
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: Maybe I can write othello in fortran
 jacek: write go in go
 MostComplicatedUsername: My td code is an if jungle
 noobyy: write a program that prints itself without taking in any arguments 
 eulerscheZahl: that's called a "Quine"
 MostComplicatedUsername: THat's impossible
 eulerscheZahl: it is possible
 noobyy: Quine
 MostComplicatedUsername: Cus if you have like a print (i)
 MostComplicatedUsername: then you have to do
 noobyy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: print ("print (i)")
 Hjax: theres quines in lots of languages 
 MostComplicatedUsername: THen you have to do
 Hjax: python has a pretty short one 
 eulerscheZahl: there are awesome variations: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mame/radiation-hardened-quine">https://github.com/mame/radiation-hardened-quine</a>
 noobyy: I'm glad I'm able to come to another random community to start shit posting&#160;:' ) 
 MostComplicatedUsername: print ("print (print(i))")
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">https://github.com/mame/quine-relay</a>
 Hjax: pythons quine: _='_=%r;print _%%_';print _%_ 
 MostComplicatedUsername: noobyy you can press tab to autofill names
 Hjax: the secret is to do some string substitution 
 Hjax: its pretty neat, i wouldnt have ever come up with it 
 noobyy: Or - can you write a program that will be able to determine whether or not another program will exit? Time and processing power is no concern. 
 eulerscheZahl: i only wrote 1 quine so far. in this language: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/hvm/">http://www.hacker.org/hvm/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: trying to solve the halting problem, noobyy?
 noobyy:&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: i paid attention in the lecture&#160;;)
 noobyy: it's a no for anyone curious. Since you feed the program into itself and it blows up the computer.
 Joseph123456743: Is there a way to always get shortest mode clash of code on private
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: "Is there a way to always get shortest mode clash of code on private" sounds like an AutomatonNN statement
 AutomatonNN: no i find it interesting
 jacek: stop pushing me down :c
 Astrobytes: Sorry, testing stuff
 Astrobytes: Is derjack your smurf jacek?
 jacek: smurf?
 Astrobytes: alt
 jacek: maybe
 jacek: one is minimax, other is mcts
 Astrobytes: Cool, I did the same when I switched, the cricri one is mine if you didn't notice
 derjack: cricri?
 Astrobytes: cricri10000, I disabled it, bottom of the leaderboard-ish
 Astrobytes: derjack is the MCTS?
 derjack: eeyup
 derjack: in my local arena mcts is superior to minimax, yet hes behind jacek :s
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's always different in the leaderboard :P
 Astrobytes: It's doing OK though
 Astrobytes: Depth 0 or increased depth for now?
 derjack: depth 0
 Astrobytes: cool
 derjack: and uses simpler eval than minimax
 derjack: the comlex one is worse in mcts but better in minimax
 Astrobytes: Yeah my minimax had more params too iirc
 Astrobytes: fucking leaderboard frozen *again*&#160;?
 derjack: well if you spam submit, why not
 Astrobytes: We're not spam submitting, waiting for first submit to finish 
 MostComplicatedUsername: Great, now im assigned to teaching a family friend python :rolling_eyes:
 MostComplicatedUsername: Who created pr2?
 AlanSpacer: And level 3 unlocks the chat
 Xlos: Nice I got a contribution accepted 3/0 despite having more downvotes than upvotes
 Xlos: Just gotta pander to the guys who have voting power
 AlanSpacer: Thats the way to go
 FlatPanda_cf5:&#160;?

 Turtho: hey, i have a question, if i want to keep and update a variable from one run to another, how do i do it&#160;? can i use external files as input for example&#160;?
 derjack: no, you cant save anything here
 Turtho: ah.. so i were to do a monte carlo tree search it would start for the beginning each time, ie it would suck&#160;?
 AntiSquid: if it would suck you could make money ... :thinking: 
 derjack: by each run, you mean each submit or each iteration per loop?
 Turtho: clever...each submit
 AntiSquid: you can't store extra files, so you train offline and then paste whatever you can into the IDE
 Turtho: it would be random everytime no&#160;?
 Turtho: oh ok thanks
 derjack: everyone starts from scratch
 derjack: and what you would store between each run?
 Turtho: the values of the nodes (number of wins and number of uses)
 derjack: this only would be slightly useful in the beginning of game. 
 Turtho: ok thanks for the help
 AntiSquid: are you sure Jack&#160;? he could have basically an opening book with that, how is it only slightly useful? :P
 derjack: useless for random openings games
 Manchi_o6o7: If someone could help me out why scanf isn't been executed

 DaNinja: suma(niz,n) recurses forever
 Manchi_o6o7: but it doesn't allows me to input n, when I start the program it ends
 DaNinja: which puzzle?
 Manchi_o6o7: my code
 Manchi_o6o7: it isn't connected with a certain puzzle
 DaNinja: you are running it locally?
 Manchi_o6o7: yes
 darkhorse64: Your code bombs before reaching print
 Manchi_o6o7: yea, but it doesn't allow me to input n
 Manchi_o6o7: it excetues
 DaNinja: n is undefined at when you declare int n,niz[n];
 DaNinja: doesnt compile
 darkhorse64: ^
 Manchi_o6o7: DaNjina thanks, it solved
 DaNinja: np
 Manchi_o6o7: the code should sum the numbers of an array recursively
 Manchi_o6o7: what it the correct recursive formula
 darkhorse64: Using recursion to sum an array is strange: use a loop
 DaNinja: yep, shouldnt use recursion for that
 DaNinja: but try return niz[n-1] + suma(niz,n-1);
 Manchi_o6o7: what is the best way to understand recursion, to visualize it
 BlaiseEbuth: int recursion(){return recursion();}
 DaNinja: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/717725/understanding-recursion">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/717725/understanding-recursion</a>
 derjack: to understand recursion first you must understand recursion
 MonteKrysto: lol
 AntiSquid: where is recursion useful on CG&#160;?
 AntiSquid: in non-functional languages
 derjack: minimax&#160;:?
 DaNinja: backtracking puzzles like the Bridge?
 AntiSquid: and how is it faster than iteration 
 BlaiseEbuth: Oo
 AntiSquid: UwU it's not the fastest, just looks more interesting
 darkhorse64: If you do not care about performance, it's easier to write a minimax in a recursive manner
 darkhorse64: backtracking is also a good example

 derjack: sometimes you dont need to read the statement fully and code right away, hence &lt;20s
 NguyenDuyAn: its like social media for nerds
 derjack: irc?
 Passifi: is irc still a thing&#160;? and social media for nerds would be stack overflow minus the social aspect :P
 derjack: irc still a thing? kids these days...
 Passifi: if I was a kid of these days I wouldn't know about irc :P
 Passifi: you still using ICQ too,  derJack&#160;?&#160;;)
 derjack: i am antisocial, so no
 ANONYMOUS42: what's irc
 derjack: better complain about it in myspace
 Passifi: irc is a place to hang out idly without ever saying a thing. its the best alternative to a chatroom 
 synchoz: derjack still some times i need to think of how to approach the problem XD 
 ChloelaBoss: Hiiiiiiiiiii whats up 
 -oa-: HI! Working on a bot(:
 derjack: bot? game?
 -oa-: For legends of code and magic:) Still in silver though
 AlinHero: Hi Guys
 AlinHero: who's good at react?
 KelvinAndHubbles: atleast for the CoC thing, some problems are literally like "output square of input" or something that I can get like sub 10 seconds on
 orangesnowfox: Yeah, I ran into that one a week or two ago
 JLukeSkywalker: please downvote those so they get removed
 JLukeSkywalker: unless they have some unique spin on them
 orangesnowfox: ig, I assume they were approved for a reason though. The one I actually ran into was a *bit* more complex than x^2, and it was a code golf, so I found it interesting enough
 JLukeSkywalker: thats what I meant by unique spin
 JLukeSkywalker: but I have defenitely seen some where it is just square or even multiply by 2
 JLukeSkywalker: and you would be surprised what gets approved
 JLukeSkywalker: ran into one yesterday that had a completely broken stub
 orangesnowfox: mm, I don't clash that much, honestly, I mostly code bots right now. Only doing a clash or two once in a while
 orangesnowfox: Working on GiTC right now, but I've been working on others too
 KelvinAndHubbles: hate the reverses that kept approved with missing testcases. Have had multiple where you get like 1 input and 2 output out of 7 cases and they aren't even for the same case
 orangesnowfox: ...
 Sakisan: that sounds more like the site is experiencing issues. No challenge would be admitted like that
 orangesnowfox: They're community approved iirc
 JLukeSkywalker: people approve them all the time
 orangesnowfox: At least in part
 orangesnowfox: I've seen some stuff over the past 4 years :p
 JLukeSkywalker: if enough people downvote and report in the post-game screen, the bot will remove them
 Astrobytes: Actually there is a technical issue with reverse mode CoCs not showing testcases currently.
 Astrobytes: (there are poor quality CoCs too)
 orangesnowfox: Oh, hey astro
 Astrobytes: hey&#160;:)
 derjack: AutomatonNN where is Him?
 AutomatonNN: why do you even know what it is to tell the same problem

 Astrobytes: Bayesian Network Classifier?
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes you changed your avatar&#160;:(

 Scarfield: you provided the link with the high res picture euler, you have yourself to blame :p
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even know what it was about
 eulerscheZahl: just saw you posting an astrobytes profile pic without any context
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even realize it was modified

 ValplOU:  Hello
 Kitkat260: hi
 ValplOU: hom are you&#160;??
 ValplOU: How*
 jacek: hmm in clobber 1st player has advantage&#160;:?
 darkhorse64: MSmits meta MCTS says no
 KelvinAndHubbles: thats wacked, I just versed a bot in CoK that I thought was very familar and then realized it was my old account from many long years ago that I can't find the email it belongs too&#160;:/
 YurkovAS: darkhorse64 in bandas you has game specific bonuses/penalties?
 jacek: darkhorse64 first move maybe no, but overall game yes. at least i think so far with my mcts games
 MSmits: jacek, that should show up on my meta mcts
 MSmits: it plays full games
 darkhorse64: I have no heuristics for bandas. It looks like having pawns in the center is good but I have not found a metric for that
 MSmits: but your bot may be different
 MSmits: I only went to 90k games though, but just for determining p1 advantage in my bots case, that should be plenty
 MSmits: darkhorse64 same, i have tried a few heuristics, but they were no good
 jacek: :c
 MSmits: all 1st moves converged on 50% as far as i could tell
 MSmits: for clobber
 MSmits: could just be  a sign my bot is not that great
 MSmits: anyway, i'm taking a nap, was just saying hi :P
 Scarfield: gn(ap)
 MSmits: thanks :P
 jacek: bye grampa
 MSmits: yep us old people need naps between yelling at clouds
 pardouin: for bandas maybe you can calculate the average distance from center
 pardouin: and maybe weight it somehow, like square it or something
 wouter173: :grin:
 jacek: or let the NN figure it out
 pardouin: ahah
 YurkovAS: pardouin thanks. i'm checked this feature without success. can't find any improvements, only performance helped a bit.
 Manchi_o6o7: Can someone help me with some C code.
 jacek: stupid clobber. turned out i had 'reversed' internal board representation
 jacek: it didnt matter when i used vanilla mcts. but when i added piece square tables then the eval became whacked
 jacek: i had to do my usual board parsing and move formatting brute force until i get it right
 thacuber: what
 jacek: Astrobytes you were right, looking at neighbours does help
 jacek: why so low kovi
 Manchi_o6o7: if someone can help me out why it doesn't prints me out the "parni" function
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d30bb20f-59c7-429c-b9f9-2ef6049a6fd4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d30bb20f-59c7-429c-b9f9-2ef6049a6fd4</a>
 JLukeSkywalker: is it printing anything?
 Manchi_o6o7: it prints blank
 JLukeSkywalker: your seond for loop in your function is never running it looks like
 JLukeSkywalker: the variables you passed make it start and end at 0
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe try printing them in your first for loop to make sure they are getting set
 kovi: was a bugged submit jacek
 jacek: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: sorry for the late reply jacek, but yes it does
 blobonmyknob: these r to hard for begginer python code clash
 blobonmyknob: ive only solved 1 so far
 Astrobytes: Obvious troll is obvious.
 leojean890: clobber is not very hard, I should migrate to C++ ;P
 Astrobytes: :D
 leojean890: I did that for othello and oware that are not very hard but harder than clobber
 leojean890: and B&amp;C2
 Astrobytes: I still have to do B&amp;C2
 leojean890: not the worst^^
 leojean890: sometimes I also use go
 leojean890: (FC2020, 2048)
 Astrobytes: Go is nice, I've played with it a bit
 Astrobytes: I'm not 100% happy with its string manipulation but other than that I quite like it
 Astrobytes: (possibly just personal preference)
 leojean890: connect 4 is not hard to migrate either
 leojean890: go is easier than C++ yes&#160;:)
 leojean890: faster than python:p
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed. And easy to get something working quickly.
 leojean890: about strings it's not the most user friendly, yeah
 leojean890: indeed
 leojean890: my first go program was FC2020
 leojean890: just I told me, let's migrate this python in go even if I never used go before;)
 leojean890: even during a contest
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I first seriously used it for I think Zenoscav e's Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe pi algo puzzle
 Astrobytes: Just to challenge myself a bit 
 leojean890: ow new contrib multi by euler 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the dice one
 leojean890: didn't do this puzzle
 Astrobytes: Oh it's a nice one
 leojean890: Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe
 Astrobytes: Yep
 leojean890: (for the moment)
 Astrobytes: When you finish it, check out Zeno's solution: it's so elegant
 leojean890: anyway I did something for nine men's morris but it's still not validated
 leojean890: only EricSMSO and me accepted^^
 leojean890: seems like to be a nice game
 leojean890: Night of war is not WIP anymore as well but didn't code something yet
 leojean890: ok I'll check his solution
 leojean890: after
 Astrobytes: It's a python solution and made me feel ashamed :D
 leojean890: concise I suppose^^
 Astrobytes: Yes, Nine Men's Morris I still have to code for, it seems fine on testing but no bot yet. I worry a little about Night of War because we try to test games really thoroughly for imbalances etc now, and it's apparently an original game (not a port of an existing one) so it's tough. It seems fun though.
 leojean890: we've almost the same ELO on cultist-wars by the way xD
 leojean890: 26.25 26.22 hmm
 Astrobytes: I desperately need to rewrite that bot of mine on Cultist Wars
 Astrobytes: I can barely read it
 leojean890: Nine Men's Morris seems fine yes ^^
 leojean890: ok, Night of War stayed WIP for a long time
 leojean890: maybe to balance the game
 leojean890: with rules of sell/buy
 leojean890: sell enabling to get gold back but less 
 leojean890: (logical, for this game to be correctly balanced)
 leojean890: maybe it's hard to balance it fine
 leojean890: same for me, my c-w bot is not easy to read, an if-forest
 Astrobytes: I made the fatal mistake of early-optimisation in my Cultist Wars bot, and therefore it has bugs. That I cannot find :D
 Astrobytes: re Night of War, yes exactly
 Astrobytes: It seems to be OK but we need some heavy testing on it now from good players
 leojean890: early-optim&#160;? before there are enough bots&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, almost everything is encoded in uints
 Astrobytes: And I have no idea what half of the variables are or mean
 leojean890: ok so you did that too early
 leojean890: bunch of if or search algo&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I had some crappy minimax going iirc
 Astrobytes: I will do the same when I rewrite I think.
 leojean890: oh ok
 leojean890: minmax could reach W1&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Oh and leojean890: regarding your last comment in last night's discussion, Chick Corea does indeed do that. And may he rest in peace. A sad loss this year
 Astrobytes: Yes, the reason I am not in W1 is my bugs :D
 leojean890: yes, he is great with that. So is Tigran Hamsayan&#160;:)
 Red64: why do console errors look different then what I see on powershell?  are error messages not universal?
 leojean890: the reason I am not in W1 is my unoptimal algo:p
 Astrobytes: Yes Tigran is amazing!
 leojean890: yeah too bad chick died :s
 leojean890: yes, he does very complex stuff
 Astrobytes: Always been a big fan (guitar-wise) of Al Di Meola, and I can't mention him without Paco de Lucia
 Astrobytes: Not quite the same thing, but man, such music
 leojean890: and rdrigo and gabriela
 leojean890: rodrigo
 Astrobytes: yay rodrigo y gabriela!
 leojean890: django reinhardt 
 leojean890:&#160;;)
 leojean890: not the same style but like it as much:)
 Astrobytes: Yes yes yes. I remember when they were just random people spreading on the grapevine before real internet videos became a thing
 Astrobytes: Ohhhhh Django 100000000%
 leojean890: yes it was hard for musicians to be known ^^and it is still but it's different using the web;)
 Astrobytes: And I have to throw Stephane Grappelli in there too because the work they did together was incredible
 leojean890: indeed!
 leojean890: do you play this style using guitar&#160;?^^
 Astrobytes: Hey, if you explore some more of what Jerry Garcia did (some stuff I linked you yesterday) you will hear a django and perhaps coltrane influence, amongst others
 Astrobytes: leojean890: I wish. I can pretend a bit
 leojean890: coltrane, nice^^
 leojean890: I like monk as well
 leojean890: monk is very unique^^
 Astrobytes: Yes 100%!
 Astrobytes: I love most players that experimented or played any kind of bop or went on to fusion
 leojean890: I can't play this style with guitar except improv
 leojean890: but didn't work rhythmic
 Astrobytes: The rhythm is HARD
 leojean890: (I  began with classical guitar)
 leojean890: so it was easier to do solos than rhythmic 
 Astrobytes: I'm self taught
 leojean890: and I specialized in solos with guitar
 leojean890: and bands with piano
 Astrobytes: And it took some time
 leojean890: bop, fusion, good yes:)
 leojean890: my band with who we play polymetrics is mostly fusion
 Astrobytes: The trick on guitar is that to play the correct (or good sounding) comping you need to A. Know the melody inside out B. Know every damn inversion there is of every damn chord. C. Know the notes to NOT play.
 struct: cuda drivers coming to wsl
 leojean890: I have an interesting video to show you but the other guy put it private, so another day when he will change its status, I asked him^^
 leojean890: need the melody to better understand chords&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Ah hey struct, sorry, me and leojean890 have derailed the chat into music related stuff. I blame myself. It's not the first time&#160;:)
 leojean890: oh yes, like tritonic substitution
 struct: its fine lol
 struct: I just saw that cuda will be available soon
 struct: and decided to share
 Astrobytes: and that  *is* cool
 leojean890: but I can do that on piano, my difficulty on guitar is rhythmic because I didn't train
 leojean890: what notes to play and not to play, indeed^^but you can play every notes on every chord:p
 leojean890: chromatisms:p
 Astrobytes: Not just with tritones and such leojean890, but knowing how to 'stay out of the way' on guitar is really important unless you are leading
 leojean890: E G F# F C# E D# D
 leojean890: E G Bb G G# A
 leojean890: C# E G F# E F
 Astrobytes: ofc, chromaticism. There is no wrong note. "What do you mean I played the wrong note? I was increasing the tension with my chromatic run" :D
 leojean890: oh other ways to substitute I see
 leojean890: yeah and bebop scales:p
 Astrobytes: Back to rhythm guitar, you need to remember the part of the sonic spectrum you're in
 leojean890: like I was writing at 1h37
 leojean890: to turn around a main note to finally end on it
 leojean890: I have to learn how to use a mediator as well
 leojean890: I use fingers and low volume^^
 Astrobytes: From my limited French I believe you mean a plectrum?
 leojean890: (I wrote notes sequences, not chords)
 leojean890: yeah plectrum
 Astrobytes: Fingers are fine, if you are happy with using fingers only, then do that
 Astrobytes: If you need to amplify it, amplify it, don't change what you do just for volume
 Astrobytes: They're two completely different ways of working. My fingerstyle is nowhere near as good as my ability with a plectrum
 Astrobytes: I can strum well with either but I'll use a plectrum mostly, sometimes some hyprid picking
 Astrobytes: *hybrid
 leojean890: but plectrum is better to have precise sounds
 leojean890: for example, rock sounds
 Astrobytes: Not if you have good nails and know how to use them!
 leojean890: yes, electroacoustic to amplify
 leojean890: it's the contrary, have more experience with fingers^^
 leojean890: I don't have nails^^
 leojean890: play with fingers only xD
 Astrobytes: Ah, nails help.
 Astrobytes: I play banjo too so it helps to grow them on a few fingers.I have neglected it recently though.
 leojean890: yes to produce huger volume
 leojean890: I should try banjo^^
 leojean890: have a ukulele as well:P
 leojean890: 2 guitars, 1 keyboard and a grand piano
 leojean890: you favored the guitar&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It's a cool instrument. I have a 5-string without a resonator, sometimes I use the metal fingerpicks for bluegrass or loud Celtic songs, otherwise I use my thumb and fingers for a clawhammer style
 Astrobytes: I also have my mandolin, but it needs repaired&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: And yeah, I was into guitar before banjo or mandolin, I bought a bass guitar after both of those though.
 Astrobytes: I wish I had an upright and a grand piano.
 leojean890: I see
 leojean890: I tried a mandolin once but don't have one
 leojean890: it's a way to change a little, at least the sound 
 leojean890: guitar =&gt; bass, banjo, mandolin, uku..
 leojean890: same for me, I played a little the bass aster
 leojean890: after
 Astrobytes: Yeah,  it's different techniques etc
 leojean890: and sound
 Astrobytes: Of course, yes
 leojean890: it's interesting to try this variation
 leojean890: I also have an ancient guitar
 leojean890: (&lt; 1900)
 leojean890: with 4 strings
 Astrobytes: Oh wow. Do you play or have you ever played it?
 leojean890: never built again now
 leojean890: yes my grandpa had it :P
 leojean890: now I have it^^
 Astrobytes: Fantastic. Keep it in the best condition you can. These instruments matter!
 leojean890: I encounter difficulties to get strings to be accurate^^
 Astrobytes: Might be worth getting it set up by someone experienced in vintage instruments
 Astrobytes: I only know 2 people (one tiny company) in London. There must be people over there that could do this.
 leojean890: yes
 leojean890: in Paris I think that there are&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It's not quite as simple as a quick turn of the truss rod with older instruments
 leojean890: some
 leojean890: of them
 leojean890: yes..:s

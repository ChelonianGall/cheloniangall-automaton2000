 Jeongyeon: hello
 DivaWeb: hello I guess I could use some clarification on The Descent challenge in javascript
 Allis: @DivaWeb As in how to process the inputs, or‒?
 DivaWeb: Yeah but I just figured it out thanks @allis
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave calling for smits at 3:41am. what are the odds to find him?
 Zenoscave: slim
 Zenoscave: I figured it out though
 Codeab: hi guys in contribution how to generate the loops
 eulerscheZahl: in the default code?
 Codeab: ya
 eulerscheZahl: there is loop and loopline
 Codeab: like for i in range blah blah blah
 eulerscheZahl: loopline is if you have many entries in the same line
 eulerscheZahl: loop if you want to read multiple lines of input
 Codeab: ya sry loopline

 eulerscheZahl: it's even linked on the contribute page -&gt; documentation&#160;;)
 Codeab: thx
 Codeab: oh whats variable sequence
 Codeab: wait nvrm
 eulerscheZahl: hi trictrac. plotting any evil things?
 trictrac: no only less pruning
 eulerscheZahl: seems to work
 eulerscheZahl: i had some timesouts. so i'm using a heuristic for the first few turns now&#160;:(
 trictrac: the disadvantage of C# against C or C++&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: the disadvantage of an exhaustive search over clever pruning
 eulerscheZahl: for each child board:
 eulerscheZahl: in early game that's a lot of possible moves for each cell. multiply with lots of possible moves and it's a timeout
 trictrac: ok many things to compute&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: and my BFS still has some issues when the opponent can block me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/JDF0dl6">https://imgur.com/a/JDF0dl6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'm yellow
 eulerscheZahl: top right corner: i think the opponent can reach that cell (33.67) before me. but i'm at the corner before
 eulerscheZahl: so i don't claim that region and lose
 trictrac: I can't read the image&#160;? broken link&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/EPWxHwR.png">https://i.imgur.com/EPWxHwR.png</a>better?
 trictrac: no same pb&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/3MQ4GbQ">https://ibb.co/3MQ4GbQ</a>
 trictrac: Ok I get the screen thanks
 trictrac: Your BFS is not taking in account the player order&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: separate BFS for each. with same distance i see it as I lost the race
 eulerscheZahl: and my distance to the corner is shorter as we see the board in the screenshot
 eulerscheZahl: just not anymore when the opponent blocks me
 eulerscheZahl: a minimax would help here obviously. but i fear more timeouts
 trictrac: all these bfs are made as evaluation of a kind of min-max
 eulerscheZahl: so i guess you can solve those situations?
 eulerscheZahl: i just have a depth 1 (only my own move) with a BFS for scoring&#160;:(
 jrke: minimax won't work great i think cause it will make very very big tree
 eulerscheZahl: in late game it could work
 trictrac: I have a completly different approach with poor eval but deep min-max
 trictrac: pruning save part of the complexity
 ProgrammerDog: hi
 eulerscheZahl: woof
 jrke: lemme revisit D&amp;B for a min
 eulerscheZahl: it's Penguins time now
 eulerscheZahl: D&amp;B was the puzzle of the week before
 The_chosen_one: Does anyone know the pattern
 Ifthel: Yes, the pattern is blue red green blue red blue
 sajan: Hello world
 jacek: yeah, d&amp;b is so last week
 eulerscheZahl: and i made it worse&#160;:/
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: i'll submit anyways to see how much worse
 _programmer_: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14542646baeccdf6c480f0694531c16bd21b494">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14542646baeccdf6c480f0694531c16bd21b494</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh boy time to get back into this
 jacek: hm?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I haven't touched CG in months
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: contest in Thursday, great time to get back to it
 eulerscheZahl: *hype*
 BenjaminUrquhart: well that's why I'm back
 jrke: :heart_eyes: 4 days
 BenjaminUrquhart: maybe I'll make a proper UTTT bot idk
 eulerscheZahl: would probably be a bad contest practice
 BenjaminUrquhart: what would you suggest then
 eulerscheZahl: did you play the previous contest?
 eulerscheZahl: i suggest the most recent one you haven't tried yet
 jrke: pacman
 BenjaminUrquhart: I did
 BenjaminUrquhart: loved it
 jrke: eulers contest i mean OOC
 eulerscheZahl: and give me my shrine!
 eulerscheZahl: (onitama sprite)
 RaymonStephanie: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1454280d5c49ea4c65ee30da4b4a495fb53f88d">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1454280d5c49ea4c65ee30da4b4a495fb53f88d</a>
 RaymonStephanie: Someone join in..
 BenjaminUrquhart: one of these days I'm actually gonna sprite a shrine and send it to you 
 codeing: hey
 BenjaminUrquhart: hey
 codeing: what's up&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: stuff
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:oh hey this started working again
 eulerscheZahl: i can kick that bot now
 BenjaminUrquhart: D:
 BenjaminUrquhart: oke
 codeing: mhm stuff like&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: stuff liek stuff
 codeing: mhm
 codeing: it's ambigious
 cegprakash: hi all
 codeing: stuff like stuff
 jacek: ohai
 cegprakash: 4 days to event I see
 BenjaminUrquhart: but actually, I've been getting into gamemaker, interesting language it uses
 jrke: lol i can see ceg after lot of time
 codeing: sure
 codeing: something else like godot
 cegprakash: omg Jrke ur global rank is impressive
 codeing: godot for 2d 3d games
 jrke: :smiley:
 cegprakash: do ppl still call u jerk?
 jrke: i think so
 cegprakash: :joy:
 cegprakash: I see witches in the cover picture of fall challenge
 jacek: will you participate in contest?
 eulerscheZahl: will you jacek?
 jacek: ill probably stop at bronze
 cegprakash: yes I'll be active on weekends and less active on weekdays
 cegprakash: jacek legend or nothing
 jrke: ceg this time t-shirts are there
 eulerscheZahl: i really think you could do well if you'd try jacek
 Illedan: Canvas or nothing!
 jacek: i have short attention
 jacek: ooh, a kitten!
 Illedan: Where?!
 jrke: above all toads or nothing&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: CG just has to host my community contest. that's probably my best chance for a canvas
 jacek: canvas?
 Illedan: top 3
 eulerscheZahl: contest artwork
 eulerscheZahl: 40x30cm
 Illedan: did you get top 3 yet euler?
 jrke: another contest by euler?
 eulerscheZahl: 4th was my best
 Illedan: Ah, mine was 5th&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the other 2 contests where i'm listed as a creator (kutulu, OOC) weren't really by me
 marcgardent: hi everybody
 eulerscheZahl: for Kutulu i did lots of testing at least. for OOC I knew 2 days before everyone else that this game exists and should be a contest
 marcgardent: Do you know, how to load "json Hash file" for spritesheet sin the SDK,  (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/spritesheets">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/spritesheets</a>)
 eulerscheZahl: hm, did that long ago
 eulerscheZahl: then reverted as i wasn't completely happy. but i might be able to answer your question
 eulerscheZahl: you upload your spritesheet to the website (Leshy SpriteSheet Tool)
 eulerscheZahl: then you let the website extract the single images on your sheet
 marcgardent: I have already cvreate the json and spritesheet 
 eulerscheZahl: and take the resulting image and json file, place them in your assets folder
 marcgardent: and so, with the code?
 Illedan: Lol, that new puzzle by Westicles :D
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5675bf9fab9a4d27753784fd901df125073f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5675bf9fab9a4d27753784fd901df125073f</a>
 Illedan: I'm saving that solution atleast ^^
 eulerscheZahl: you can access the single sprites by using the name you assigned in the json
 eulerscheZahl: sprite.setImage("someName")
 marcgardent: mm ok&#160;! fine
 marcgardent: thx
 eulerscheZahl: that Westicles puzzle is at high risk to break at some language update :D
 Illedan: xD
 Westicles: I never could figure out how F# and vb.net work.  Just layers and layers of weird scripts
 eulerscheZahl: if L=="TypeScript":s+="/opt/coderunner/nodejs/bin/node -r /codemachine/lib/javascript/internal/polyfill.js -r /opt/coderunner/nodejs/lib/node_modules/source-map-support/register /tmp/A\n"how are we supposed to figure that one out? :D
 Westicles: Ah, that's probably straight out of Tester.sh
 conaldev: hello, world&#160;!
 sebak: hello programmers
 TatsuJoestar: @tychkorg, how did you solve test case 3
 wlesavo: lol that puzzle :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: @TatsuJoestar that tychkorg is a bot and won't answer you
 eulerscheZahl: CodinGame has bots in Clash of Code who replay what previous clashers did. so you don't have to wait for some real player to join (which could take a while depending on the current time of day)
 TatsuJoestar: oh
 eulerscheZahl: do you remember the task? we could search the clash and solve it here together
 yurv: Hello, anybody knows how to see the task of already finished clash?
 yurv: is it possible to replay the task alone?
 TatsuJoestar: how do you search for it?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>happy searching. there is no official way
 TatsuJoestar: it was something to do with a waiter named Niki and you had to check to see if they&#160;% of total tips to total bill was greater than the &amp; needed for him to get drunk 
 yurv: thank you, I'll check it out
 TatsuJoestar: and you output "DRUNK" 
 TatsuJoestar: "THIRSTY"
 TatsuJoestar: accordingly
 eulerscheZahl: found it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451655c809e713c763785c043df57a078901">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451655c809e713c763785c043df57a078901</a>

 TatsuJoestar: my code
 TatsuJoestar: and he was the only one who got 100% we all got 75%
 eulerscheZahl: something is odd with this clash. i can't open it in the IDE?
 eulerscheZahl: i've never seen that before
 DaNinja: same, cant open it
 NightScap3: Nice Supermuppet nice copy&amp;paste kek
 eulerscheZahl: supermuppet is a bot
 NightScap3: bruh
 NightScap3: fr?
 eulerscheZahl: the only thing it can do is copy-paste :D

 eulerscheZahl: "CodinGame Official Bots"
 yurv: TatsuJoestar, you forgot to multiply by 100%
 TatsuJoestar: the&#160;% is given as an int
 TatsuJoestar: not as .10 for 10% but just 10
 yurv: no, tip/total*100
 yurv: tip/total*100&gt;percentage
 TatsuJoestar: I did total/tip &gt;= percentage
 yurv: that's not right
 TatsuJoestar: if you have 100 total and 10 in tips it divides in 10 times
 TatsuJoestar: if you need 10% or greater that works
 yurv: 10$/100$=0.1 = 0.1*100%=10%
 TatsuJoestar: since you get it as an int you don't need to actually treat it as a percent, you just need to see if it divides into a number &gt;=
 TatsuJoestar: it works the same
 TatsuJoestar: if i was given the value as a decimal representing a percentage
 TatsuJoestar: I would have to do it that way
 yurv: you didn't multiply by 100
 TatsuJoestar: it works i swear lol
 yurv: if((billtotal / tiptotal) &gt;= percentage){
 TatsuJoestar: you can do tiptotal/billtotal *100
 TatsuJoestar: that works too
 TatsuJoestar: but mine is simpler and works also
 TatsuJoestar: it's just the "more tables" test that doesn't work for
 TatsuJoestar: but i don'tt think it's because of the code I think it's something to do with the validator
 TatsuJoestar: because we all got 75% 
 yurv: billtotal / tiptotal is not a percentage, you cannot compare it to percentage
 TatsuJoestar: only missing that one
 TatsuJoestar: okay let me ask you
 TatsuJoestar: say you have $2500 bill total
 TatsuJoestar: and $100 tip total
 TatsuJoestar: tell me what percent of the bill total that the tip total represents
 yurv: I think you have to divide tip total by bill and multiply by 100
 TatsuJoestar: just tell me the number tho
 yurv: 4%
 _programmer_: hry
 _programmer_: hey
 _programmer_: please help
 _programmer_: isalnum in python
 _programmer_: it says it is not defined
 _programmer_: please answer fast i am in clash
 hem123: isalphanumeric
 hem123: yes isalnum is in python
 _programmer_: editor says it is not defined
 yurv: if((tiptotal/billtotal )*100 &gt;= percentage){
 hem123: q="test"print(q.isalnum())
 TatsuJoestar: man 
 TatsuJoestar: I am fucking retarded
 hem123: yes
 TatsuJoestar: this is what i get for staying up 30hours straight on adderall
 TatsuJoestar: I can't even math
 TatsuJoestar: wtf im going to bed
 yurv: no worries, that happens to me all the time
 TatsuJoestar: yurv I'm sorry
 yurv: we all learn on our own mistakes
 TatsuJoestar: its sleep time for me LOL
 TatsuJoestar: OR
 TatsuJoestar: is it another half adderall time?
 TatsuJoestar: LOL
 _programmer_: thanks  @hem123
 TatsuJoestar: on another note
 TatsuJoestar: shortest code clashes are not winnable with c++
 yurv: yeah, I know
 yurv: my Java code is always at the bottom of the list
 yurv: we have to have a separate clash of code for Java,C++
 SparkCoder: You can 
 yurv: a private clash?
 SparkCoder: maybe not against python always
 SparkCoder: but you can
 SparkCoder: you just have to know what you can reduce
 SparkCoder: like
 SparkCoder: spaces
 SparkCoder: variabel name sizes
 SparkCoder: new lines
 SparkCoder: you can also use macros
 yurv: you cannot reduce class Solution {
 yurv: it won't start
 SparkCoder: I am talking about C++
 yurv: public static void main(String args[]) {
 yurv: I see
 SparkCoder: java is just too much boilerplate
 SparkCoder: which is why I stopped using java
 TatsuJoestar: either way you can't beat python when you have to cout &lt;&lt; "BLAH BLAH";
 SparkCoder: if you have a lot couts
 TatsuJoestar: using namespace std
 SparkCoder: you can use
 TatsuJoestar: #include
 TatsuJoestar: it counts all that lol
 TatsuJoestar: god forbid you need to use a 2d vector
 SparkCoder: #define p cout
 TatsuJoestar: vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;
 SparkCoder: yes
 TatsuJoestar: also have to definite type
 TatsuJoestar: define type*
 SparkCoder: #define v std::vector
 SparkCoder: v&lt;v&lt;int&gt;&gt;
 TatsuJoestar: yeah but if you only need 1
 TatsuJoestar: thats actually longer
 TatsuJoestar: it counts #define right?
 TatsuJoestar: as characters
 SparkCoder: yes
 SparkCoder: if you have more than one 3d vectors
 SparkCoder: this works
 SparkCoder: other wise over head changes are 0
 TatsuJoestar: yeah ofc
 SparkCoder: 2d*
 TatsuJoestar: but still my point remains
 SparkCoder: then again its always a good challenge
 TatsuJoestar: very rarely will you makeup ground on a python character count 
 SparkCoder: you can remove all \n
 TatsuJoestar: I mean I always try lol
 SparkCoder: obsfurcate your code
 TatsuJoestar: I use 1 letter variable names too
 TatsuJoestar: lol
 SparkCoder: I usually flip a coin
 SparkCoder: poython coin flipper
 TatsuJoestar: I take out all whitespaces that I don't need
 SparkCoder: and choose
 SparkCoder: which langauge I program in
 SparkCoder: c++ or python (usually)
 SparkCoder: so that its more of a challenge
 SparkCoder: codincup?
 SparkCoder: I accidently closed your chat
 NoobMaster96: ur all bumbums
 SparkCoder: ignore him he is harmless
 NoobMaster96: no YOUR harmless
 NoobMaster96: print("Thou art harmlesso")
 eulerscheZahl: my harmless what?

 hem123: Just wondering, how can one get code golf dont panic in like code size 60
 hem123: retreiving all the inputs is costing me 60
 SparkCoder: in which langauge
 hem123: python
 SparkCoder: whcih question
 SparkCoder: chuck norris code golf?
 hem123: hang on might have something
 SparkCoder: use regex
 MadKnight: SparkCoder he said which
 MadKnight: it's dont panic
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 can u get 59 chars?
 Automaton2000: i am not very good

 Illedan: Wonder if the contest is related to the art :thinking:
 Illedan: C4L all over again
 Astrobytes: Hmmm
 Astrobytes: I don't have a good feeling about it if I'm honest
 Illedan: Might be totally unrelated, like WW :P
 Astrobytes: I think they learned their lesson artwork-wise after that lol
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: That artwork made no sense :D
 Astrobytes: None whatsoever. Very odd
 Astrobytes: But who knows, could be a game with spaceships
 Illedan: Lightsabers! Join the dark side :rocket:
 Astrobytes: We have an almost lightsaber game, the fencing one
 Illedan: Not sure what I feel about that one :P 
 Astrobytes: Yeah same, has he finished the other leagues?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: that was hella complex
 Astrobytes: Do the extra 'features/abilities' bring anyhthing to it?
 Illedan: I didn't understand everything
 Illedan: Gave up
 Illedan: had to put focus elsewhere
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I'll have a look at it again later or tomorrow
 Astrobytes: tric tracs Fireworks game looks intriguing
 Illedan: Too much text for me to bother xD

 eulerscheZahl: for short contests go to codeforces
 Astrobytes: I prefer longer yeah
 eulerscheZahl: 1 week is a good duration

 AndreMarasca: yep
 AndreMarasca: :disappointed:
 MrMiagi: Anyone else have lags while playing testcase and clash of code?
 v1993: Yeah
 v1993: Other portions of site are also lagging
 MasterDuck: Unplayable...
 AndreMarasca: Yes, I also have lag to run the test cases, I have to use VSCode
 MrMiagi: think its ok now
 v1993: Still lags for me on testcases
 v1993: Not as badly as before, but still notably
 MasterDuck: True
 hiljusti: is it lag... or is it a challenge?!
 hem123: question I played code royale, I won 60/60 yet I am ranked 240th
 hem123: how is that possible?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you are in wood1
 hem123: y
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did you pass wood1 boss?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you are ranked 240th in whatever league you are in
 hem123: well i didnt get there. like when i test in arena
 hem123: I only play against others
 hem123: where i play my code I win from the boss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the 'submit' or 'test in arena' will play you and rank you
 hem123: I only play against others--&gt; meaning against low ranked people
 PatrickMcGinnisII: to progress from leagyue to league you have to submit and beat boss
 hem123: yes i am doing it again, previous 2 times i had 100% victories
 hem123: but the opponents i am getting matched against are all ~400
 PatrickMcGinnisII: main leaderboard shows you at 1985th , it will update after your 'test in arena' is done
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you beat boss in points, you will go up to next league
 hem123: yes that i understand, but somehow I win everything yet I do not gain rank
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i see you at 3.07 points, that's kinda low
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3.18 now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: look at previous battles tab
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no way u r at 100% winrate
 hem123: yet i won the last 150 matches
 hem123: oke well my name is highlighted
 hem123: ah nvm
 hem123: fixed it thanks, i was being an idiot

 JBM: isn't there a chan for that?
 b0n5a1: -&gt; #Alex ^^
 Astrobytes: JBM: re. your first FreeCell post on Concisely Garbled, "It iterates from the wrong eng"
 JBM: ew
 JBM: thanks
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: also I loved the þ
 JBM: ^^
 Astrobytes: Quick look at the second one (not read it), "Entertainement"
 JBM: nice, thanks
 Astrobytes: all good, keep 'em coming. I'll read the second one properly tomorrow, the last one was top notch&#160;:)

 Ifthel: Well, welcome. Which programming language(s) do you know?
 123456789LL: none sadly 
 123456789LL: but uhh private message 
 TatsuJoestar: which languages do you want to learn?

 Domantas1: Hello! I am new to programming and I am studying computer sciences. Right now I am playing - Game Of Drones and I can't figure out how to make that drones defend one zone or attack other zones if it's free. I would be very glad if someone help me&#160;:) programing language is c++.

 elderlybeginner: xrange?
 elderlybeginner: what are you trying to do with gaussian distribution?
 The_Auditor: Domantas1 not clear on the question, are you asking how to send the drones or how to decide to send or not to send the drones&#160;?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Domantas1 I think you have the wrong idea- You don't "attack" or "defend", you just move drones around
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: elderlybeginner no idea, I don't understand the code at all, which is why I need someone to explain it :stuck_out_tongue:
 elderlybeginner: there should be range instead of xrange, and beside that it works. That's not my area of interests, all I can see is that it's based on gaussian distribution and mayby calculating part of CDF <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function</a>

 Majeck: Hullo
 Majeck: Don't  mean to be a nuisance, but does anyone have an idea on how  I can golf the following (python3):[-1,1]['R'in D]*yI felt really smart by using the 1s and 0s of the true false as numbers but it ends up using the same characters&#160;;((2*('R'in D)-1)*y
 Majeck: The purpose of the code is that if 'R' in D evaluates as true, then return 1 else return -1
 Majeck: where D is a string and y another set of expressions

 VN~Minh4893IT: hello &lt;33
 Tien118: hi minh
 AryanTripathi: coc job done :moyai:
 AryanTripathi: finally reached legend level
 j4at: cheater lol
 AryanTripathi: no
 AryanTripathi: it literally took me 900+ clashes to get it
 AryanTripathi: lmao
 Thorcode: bruh
 AryanTripathi: anyways gm guys
 AryanTripathi: hii thorcode long time no c
 Thorcode: gm
 AryanTripathi: where have you been?
 AryanTripathi: eat taco
 AryanTripathi: taco eat
 AryanTripathi: taco eat person
 AryanTripathi: lmao
 AryanTripathi: taco bot dead
 j4at: AryanTripathi then share the code of this clash

 StevenV: gm?
 StevenV: what is gm?
 jacek: happy Caturday
 j4at: AryanTripathi so&#160;? 
 j4at: share the code&#160;?
 j4at: 5DN1L can mods see hidden code in clashes?
 j4at: My dude finished the clash mentioned above in 45 secs using the language used by the contribution maker (javascript). It's not that easy. I thought maybe he did the clash before.
 j4at: But when I asked him him to share the code he refused. He made an execuse that he is in another clash. But when I asked him again he just ignored me, I pinged him multiple times + he was writing in World chat in the same time.
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/697584a9827f06e5aa94b9ca54b1d1344a06">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/697584a9827f06e5aa94b9ca54b1d1344a06</a>
 JS53: hiii good morning guys
 JS53: lol no one here in the chat
 JS53: sad
 Westicles: j4at, mods can't see that kind of stuff. 
 Tinaud: j4at if you want more proofs, I found that same guy suspicious sooner. He submitted a 400+ chars solution in a shortest clash, in 59 seconds, without sharing. I checked the contribution, and the proposed solution is exactly the length of his.

 eulerscheZahl: searching for "counter", then for "strategy". btw you can search for more than 1 word at a time
 JS53: what you guys talking about?
 Westicles: guy bragged about his coc prowess then was outed as a cheater
 Westicles: not an American, we are highly ethical
 JS53: ohh
 JS53: is my clash of code rank is the rank which is in my profile?
 JS53: btw wesitcles can you play coc with me?
 Westicles: no, I'm no good at that, look at my rank
 JS53: ohh i see
 JS53: yee! i got 50 xp
 AryanTripathi: i am sorry for cheating guys I am really sorry, I promise I will not do that again
 KrishnaTripathi302: why even did you cheated?
 AryanTripathi: just to get into top 1000
 KrishnaTripathi302: mhm
 ethaneCH3CH3: how can you cheat in this game lol 
 eulerscheZahl: when you played enough clashes, you can see the code of the problem creator on the contribution page
 eulerscheZahl: enough=300
 eulerscheZahl: how can one even play 300 clashes and not reach top1000 at the same time?
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't just submit a broken code on purpose, that's an achievement on its own
 Uljahn: setting achievable goals is good, but the main question is "have you really become better at coding or just at gaming the system?"
 khanglovesIT: how can i beat bot in wood league 1
 Uljahn: you mean without reading any hints?
 khanglovesIT: i cant beat it i don't know why
 Uljahn: maybe the boss is too strong for you
 khanglovesIT: mad pod racing
 khanglovesIT: boss 3 i can't beat
 khanglovesIT: there's something wrong with my code
 khanglovesIT: but i don't know&#160;:((((
 Uljahn: how do you know?
 khanglovesIT: because my car takes a long time to turn over and change angle for a new checkpoint
 Uljahn: maximum turn rate is 18 degrees per turn

 khanglovesIT: where is my code wrong???
 Uljahn: you don't print trust
 Uljahn: *thrust
 Uljahn: try this:print(next_checkpoint_x, next_checkpoint_y, thrust)
 Uljahn: but you'll have no boost in this case...
 5DN1L: Are you able to explain what your code does?
 5DN1L: oops
 5DN1L: chat doesn't scroll
 5DN1L: ignore me
 khanglovesIT: UlJahn I can't use boost so the boss wins me
 Uljahn: guess you can add another if-statement to use boost at the first turn
 khanglovesIT: what can i add if
 jacek: oO
 Fallheur: hello
 jacek: happy Caturday
 jacek: Automaton2000 are you still there
 Automaton2000: msmits what do you guys have any advice for some guy who is just getting into coding and just struggles ...
 struct: hi
 apopogang: l
 deadpanda: lkjh
 Fallheur: i am looking for some help/trick in python. I am trying to initialize a dictionnary without putting an input().split() in a list
 deadpanda: k
 jacek: can you give example of input
 jacek: and your desired dict
 Fallheur: code:
 Fallheur: incoming=[input().split() for i in range(n)]
 Fallheur: output:
 Fallheur: [['A', '20'], ['B', '10']]
 Fallheur: (i mean the value of "incoming")
 Fallheur: I tried&#160;: incoming={input().split().join(':') for i in range(n)} 
 Fallheur: but it doesn't work
 jacek: dict([['A', '20'], ['B', '10']])&#160;?
 struct: Is 20 the number of times that A is present?
 Fallheur: it is the value of A
 Mortis_666: u want the dict o look like {'A':20,'B':10}&#160;?
 Fallheur: yes
 Mortis_666: dict(input().split() for i in range(int(input()))) will work
 Fallheur: how did i forgot about the 'dict' inctruction? thank you
 Fallheur: (mortis and jacek)
 Mortis_666: üëç
 Fallheur: I can't believe I bothered you with such a thing... 
 Fallheur: thanks again, i am going back to my puzzle
 jacek: which puzzle
 jacek: struct hows hexapawn
 Fallheur: @Jacek: Equivalent Resistance, Circuit Building
 Fallheur: (easy puzzle)
 struct: hi jacek sry
 struct: was afk
 struct: I havent done much yet
 struct: The example I linked here 2 or 3 days ago
 struct: use policy
 struct: I dont think I want to use policy for cg do I?
 struct: I would try policy for search race though
 struct: But I will try to make hexapawn without policy first
 struct: It will probably take me quite some time to do it though
 Joleaf: Can i look somewhere in the validator cases of blender 1?
 Joleaf: *blunder
 eulerscheZahl: no, they are not accessible
 eulerscheZahl: you aren't that far off with "Blender", in the past it was called Bender
 struct: does derjack use policy on search race?
 jacek: 2 output nodes - one for angle and one for thrust
 Joleaf: :D I missed one validator case, however, the test case works&#160;:(
 jacek: so it is basically policy i guess?
 struct: Have you tried like 5 moves for policy and then value?
 struct: I dont know the terms so Im just trying to describe the best way I can
 jacek: no i didnt
 HarryYo: Hey guys wassup
 HarryYo: Anybody here willing to help with my homework? I can't understand the question. Meaning what I have to learn or research about
 struct: is it a simple question?
 Dren: I mean you are probably asking the wrong person if they can't figure it out
 Dren: lol
 helpmefindaname: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dontasktoask.com/">https://dontasktoask.com/</a>
 HarryYo: Yes it only requires abstract classes to be made
 HarryYo: I mean it's a data visualisation scenario but I can't seem to know where to start
 Westicles: damn, that cheater guy from last night gave a 3rd rejection
 struct: who is cheating?
 Westicles: some guy pasting code into clashes
 Westicles: a minor crime, but he rejected my beautiful contrib, unforgivable 
 Dren: :eyes:

 TimothyAlexisVass: :taco: Westicles
 TimothyAlexisVass:&#160;:(
 jacek: :rage:
 Harsh_Chourasiya: Hey
 tommy_52012: hi
 AryanTripathi: @Westicles I rejected your contribution because it was very hard and difficult for COC 
 Westicles: nah
 AryanTripathi: for you it's easy to say it's not hard
 AryanTripathi: and also no need to say me a cheater and tell everyone about it all the time, i don't like if people do like that
 AryanTripathi: I apologised for cheating and promised will not do that again
 AryanTripathi: but you people don't understand that
 Westicles: If you reject all the ones you personally can't solve then the talented guys won't ever have a challenge
 jacek: i shall put space maze as clash
 jacek: but there are no graphics in clash&#160;:(
 5DN1L: fair point
 AryanTripathi: I am not only the one who can't solve that, two more peoples can't solve too, and maybe more than two can't solve, people didn't reject your contribution because they can't solve it, people reject your contribution because they think others can't solve it
 AryanTripathi: I also got so many of my contributions rejected but I didn't said that "That cheater guy/newbie noob guy can't solve it that's why he rejected it", I started seeing some contributions started learning how they make questions and then I again started making contribution
 Westicles: You had to play 900 clashes to break into the top1000, and that was with cheating.  I don't think you get to judge these things
 AryanTripathi: Can't you understand I apologised for that?
 5DN1L: fine, both of you have voiced your opinions
 5DN1L: please stop arguing here
 AryanTripathi: lmao
 AryanTripathi: angry 5DN1L :joy:
 5DN1L: i'm not angry
 AryanTripathi: uhm kk chill
 TimothyAlexisVass: 2 of the 3bots beat me this clash :laughing:
 AryanTripathi: which bots?
 5DN1L: the clash bots just recycle the code used by previous human players of the same clash
 AryanTripathi: ohh how do you detect the bots
 5DN1L: you can identify them by checking the leaderboard of clash of code
 5DN1L: they have the highest frequency of participation
 AryanTripathi: i've heard that a coc player "BSod" is a bot is that true?
 5DN1L: yes
 AryanTripathi: ohh demn

 AryanTripathi: are they all bot?
 eulerscheZahl: jacek 04:34·¥æ·¥πi shall put space maze as clashbut there are no graphics in clash
 eulerscheZahl: space maze ASCII art?
 jacek: :thinking:
 Westicles: man, everybody is razzing me today.  one of the #fr guys called me a cow
 5DN1L: relax, Westicles
 jacek: mooo
 eulerscheZahl: they meant coward but forgot that ard
 Westicles: :P
 5DN1L: better if they call Westicles a leg
 5DN1L: but forget the end
 TimothyAlexisVass: :cow:
 jacek: try omelette du fromage
 TimothyAlexisVass: :cow2:
 AryanTripathi: why people leave their contribution in WIP, even if it's ready?
 Zorg1: to farm XP
 AryanTripathi: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: troll vs castle &gt; 2 contest creations
 AryanTripathi: yep true true 
 eulerscheZahl: but that you would get the 2500XP twice
 eulerscheZahl: *not that
 AryanTripathi: it literally got +553 score
 Westicles: In other news I've been killing myself trying to solve these derivative puzzles symbolically, turns out you just have to do finite differences
 5DN1L: yeah, same here, tackling it the difficult way
 5DN1L: learned something interesting though
 AryanTripathi: hey @Westicles check DMs I sent you some ideas
 Harsh_Chourasiya: Hey
 CRIS0: i don't know about you guys, but on my terminal it works perfectly, on the other hand, here, the program gives me errors. this is out of my understanding
 jacek: what program
 CRIS0: for now, the "Horse-racing Duals" gives me troubles
 jacek: what errors
 jacek: works for me
 CRIS0: something with type error. error that i do not encounter on my pycharm...
 jacek: screenshot?
 Mugrim_FF: lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
 5DN1L: no spam please
 CRIS0: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/NVMVLh8">https://ibb.co/NVMVLh8</a>
 AryanTripathi: lmao
 AryanTripathi: reeee
 5DN1L: CRIS0 your code keeps overwriting the same variable pi
 CRIS0: @jacek i forgot to give a variable to diff, but is the same error.
 Mugrim_FF: lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
 5DN1L: kicked, next is a ban
 CRIS0: even if i let it without the "for" loop, gives me somethign wi the index out of range
 CRIS0: with*
 5DN1L: CRIS0 try storing the numbers in a list
 5DN1L: pi is not a list
 5DN1L: it is an integer
 CRIS0: ok, but why on pycharm is working and here no?
 5DN1L: you split there
 5DN1L: split a string into a list of numbers
 CRIS0: i split it here, too:)) gives me the error with list index
 CRIS0: the same code
 5DN1L: but you see the statement says:
 5DN1L: "N following lines"
 5DN1L: each horse strength is given to you in one line
 5DN1L: there's nothing to split
 5DN1L: when you do your code locally, you put all the horse strengths in one line
 5DN1L: that's a different input format
 jacek: n = int(input())pi = [int(input()) for i in range(n)]
 CRIS0: so i have to make a list and then append the numbers to that list?
 5DN1L: either your way or jacek's way
 jacek: .split() doesnt work with multiple lines
 jacek: that it, with input()
 CRIS0: now i understand
 CRIS0: thank you.
 5DN1L: drjacek will be happy
 5DN1L: or is it derjack?
 CRIS0: good. for first to cases worked. but for third... no
 CRIS0: "FailureProcess has timed out. This may mean that your solution is not optimized enough to handle some cases."
 jacek: yeah, cg servers are slow
 5DN1L: there can be quicker ways to do it :shrug:
 jacek: buy more RAM?
 5DN1L: Received an email from my bank just now: Protect Yourself Online. Beware of Phishing Scams
 5DN1L:  CRIS0 check out the front page of the puzzle
 5DN1L: there's a hint to what can be done
 CRIS0: let me guess. in the same email the "bank" is asking your credit card details?:))
 CRIS0: ok. i'll take a look
 5DN1L: no, it's actually really the bank I have an account with :joy:

 eulerscheZahl: fall for what?

 eulerscheZahl: i don't have a credit card, i'll never know my minion name&#160;:(
 Ayza: as long an anime girl wants my credit card sure :slight_smile:
 CRIS0: ok, that's it, i don't know how to handle a list with 100k entries.&#160;:(
 5DN1L: did you find the keyword on the front page?
 Westicles: Got everything to pass except ln(ln(ln(ln x))), maybe I'll figure out why later
 CRIS0: i read it, but i'm not sure if you saw what i saw:)) "large arrays"?
 5DN1L: This puzzle shows that sometimes, the simplest solution is not performant enough. You will also learn to handle large arrays and gain experience with their processing time.External resources SortingLists 
 CRIS0: so sorting
 5DN1L: yes!
 CRIS0: i don't know why, but i jumped over that:))
 5DN1L: now you can have another try&#160;:)

 Ayza: shouldn't there be a mathematics tag or is the statement just scary
 coconnexion: hey
 struct: hi
 struct: Those are the types of puzzles I avoid
 Westicles: I didn't like it at first but ended up pretty fun
 Westicles: Had to do it in python, good practice I rarely use that
 Ayza: lol, you're the only submitted solution
 Ayza: either a new puzzle or too hard
 Westicles: 5D solved it but I don't think he usually publishes
 5DN1L: true
 5DN1L: read an article on using Reverse Polish Notation for derivatives
 5DN1L: fun on implementing that lol
 eulerscheZahl: many years ago i wrote a formula parser for fun, that can also compute derivatives
 eulerscheZahl: but if i try it, i probably feel lazy here and compute the value around the point
 Westicles: yeah, I ended up doing it that way.  didn't really know how that worked with multiple partial derivatives until I looked it up
 eulerscheZahl: just saw that and wonder how to do it :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the missing brackets annoy me
 eulerscheZahl: sin y*z
 Westicles: and it breaks on one case since you are taking logs of negative numbers and eval can't handle that
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just not do it then, problem solved
 eulerscheZahl: but i did a hacker.org task just today
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4892c8a7-6e89-4cc0-a7ce-9bbfb41c585f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4892c8a7-6e89-4cc0-a7ce-9bbfb41c585f</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but hacker.org is wrong regarding the accepted solution. off by 1
 eulerscheZahl: so i was guessing after i solved it
 struct: im not even sure if the change I did on c4 was better or not
 jacek: what change
 struct: I dont think its significant, might be just randomness
 struct: I just made it have a chance to select childs with same uct score
 jacek: better spam submit to make sure
 struct: instead of always picking the 1st one
 jacek: how often would that be though
 struct: probably only at the start
 struct: I do rolout for all expanded childs so it might be more common
 struct: or it can just be rng
 ImSeaFu: Hmmmm what's the point of these bots that add you on here?
 struct: what do you mean?
 ImSeaFu: I have a few people following me that are definitely bots since they followed me when I've been inactive and would have no organic way of finding me afaik

 eulerscheZahl: you even spammed me down to 6th and back up to 3rd
 YurkovAS: and csb lb broken

 YurkovAS: he use 150ms
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure he adjusted his bot
 eulerscheZahl: dapo is still on 150ms
 eulerscheZahl: hard to tell with those huge gaps now, but they should both be around your rank if not crashing
 struct: well some of them used minimax
 struct: might be harder for the bot to be good with half the time
 YurkovAS: i'm use brutal tester, but more easy is just submit
 eulerscheZahl: i admire your passion to try hard on all those old contests
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree i did that too. but only a dozen games out there when i found my way to CG
 YurkovAS: :smiley:
 jacek: yeah, who would obsess over some games on some site :unamused:
 DomiKo: and some CP points
 eulerscheZahl: for CSB it doesn't matter CP-wise if you are 1st or 100th

 DomiKo: of course

 eulerscheZahl: and fully deterministic

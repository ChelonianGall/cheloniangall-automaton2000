 Uljahn: Automaton2000: do bots dream of electric taco?
 Automaton2000: i must have missed that
 MrZee: Fair
 DarkMatriac: I keep getting red underline under some parts of my code but there are no errors and my code runs just fine. I always need to reload the page to fix it. Am I doing anything wrong or is it just the website that does that often?
 MrZee: I've noticed it on mostly the bot IDEs when they're open for a long time, so I think it's somewhat typical
 DarkMatriac: It happens to me after like sometimes 2 minutes of having the page open. I guess I'll just live with it xD
 Uljahn: which language?
 DarkMatriac: c++
 MrZee: For me I've been using C#, but it's not very often
 MrZee: Either the IDE will say there's an error or the playback when testing my code will freeze but the console will continue outputting as if nothing's wrong
 DarkMatriac: is there a way to know where my output fail exactly when there are like 30 lines of individual test in the same test case?
 MrZee: I personally use a whole lot of console.error.writelines to figure out what my code is seeing at every step
 DarkMatriac: Actually i think I have an idea
 derjack: :upside_down:
 therealbeef: you can run the code on your own computer, mimic the input, and use a debugger
 DarkMatriac: Actually I just outputted a defined number of answer until I was able to locate the one that failed. 
 derjack: coin guessing game eh
 DarkMatriac: exactly xD
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: ouch, they picked an event where zeno and oher are in play

 5DN1L: Kururugi Just paste your lines here
 Kururugi: Thanks. I am trying to implement a backtracking solution for sudoku solver and I am not able to get the backtracking executed within time limit for last test case.
 Kururugi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b991998f-7769-441a-92bd-81c86ffcfa32">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b991998f-7769-441a-92bd-81c86ffcfa32</a>
 Kururugi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sudoku-solver">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sudoku-solver</a>
 YS_Yousef: every one of my friend solved it but i didn't XD
 Kururugi: My current approach is to just naively backtrack and go through each possibilites till i reach final cell. Any suggestions for improving time?
 MrZee: I ran into the same issue, I managed to solve it by searching for the row, collumn, or 3x3 section that had the least amount of open cells and start from there
 MrZee: You end up having to go through a lot less combinations then
 Kururugi: I see
 TAPQI: Another solution would be to use a faster language. I got the naive backtracking working with rust, without optimizing it all that much
 MrZee: Yeah, I did it in C#, I ran a count of how many loops it took to run a regular backtracking code and it came up as over 300,000 loops. When I started solving it using the smallest cluster of open cells first, it went down to a little over 4,000 loops
 YS_Yousef: guys how does the new event work (e.g A coin guessing game)?
 Andriamanitra: why bother optimizing when you can just slap functools.lru_cache somewhere and it'll likely work
 YS_Yousef: I solved it but I don't know do I need to add comments or any thing?
 MrZee: Only if you plan to publish your code for others
 YS_Yousef: i want
 YS_Yousef: to publish it
 MrZee: Then yeah, I'd recommend adding some explanatory comments, then when you go to the solutions page of the puzzle you can have your code published
 YS_Yousef: thx
 YS_Yousef: I will do that
 MrZee: When you finish your commenting make sure to submit the code again though so it saves the updated version
 YS_Yousef: yea thx :thumbsup:

 5DN1L: Automaton2000 bring some happiness to the coders
 Automaton2000: can someone check my code because i was trying to do with the input and output
 MrZee: same
 YS_Yousef: did this make me happy and i don't know?
 MrZee: Well personally the hardest part in coding is the input, the output, and everything inbetween
 YS_Yousef: you mean every thing XD
 MrZee: Yep!
 YS_Yousef: hhhhhh XD
 YS_Yousef: can someone see my solution about " A Coin Guessing Game"?
 YS_Yousef: to give me his feedback?
 5DN1L: Maybe you should mention which programming language your solution uses?
 YS_Yousef: how to mention?
 5DN1L: i mean in the chat
 5DN1L: it's in Python, isn't it?
 YS_Yousef: ahh ok python guys
 YS_Yousef: I will try to make it in c# but I am a piece of cake in c#\ XD
 5DN1L: erm... "piece of cake" means easy?
 YS_Yousef: no you know what is the place of cake in the real sentence XD do you?

 YS_Yousef: ok
 YS_Yousef: that is good
 YS_Yousef: Why the code helper does not help me in c#?
 5DN1L: what do you mean by code helper
 YS_Yousef: e.g does not make me see the error in my code
 YS_Yousef: the code helper that like who say that there is an error
 YS_Yousef: assist I think
 YS_Yousef: ah it worked now
 5DN1L: :ok_hand:
 YS_Yousef: :blush:
 YS_Yousef: ok i will not make it in c# XD
 Andriamanitra: i have created a masterpiece
 YS_Yousef: what master piece
 Andriamanitra: someone should make a museum of beautiful programs just so my coin guessing game solution could be displayed there
 YS_Yousef: can i see your code?
 YS_Yousef: i made my own code
 Andriamanitra: i managed to use three obscure language features on one line in perfect harmony
 YS_Yousef: so i will not rob it XD  don't worry i will not rob it :joy: 
 kryptoid: hi fellow n*erds

 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: darn, another of my clashes got removed
 Husoski: Anyone here fluent in Ruby and willing to answer a Ruby-noobie question?
 Scarfield: just ask your question, you might get an answer. No need to ask - to ask&#160;:)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: do reverse clashes show test/validator names?
 Husoski: In a recent clash I saw the following:
 Esc.exe: Build the Fibonacci Sequence but with given inputs instead of set inputs, 0 and 1. Construct an additive sequence with t, a number of times to loop, a, a first starting digit, and b, a second starting digit.
 5DN1L: You may read the hints on the left first, Juuiiccee
 Scarfield: just ask your question, and be specific about your problem, no need to ask to ask Juuiiccee&#160;:) you have to update the position of thor yourself, thats the usual problem people forget
 5DN1L: and that too ^
 Juuiiccee: yeah ive got all the if statements to have him decide which way to move I just cant get him to actually move lol
 Ninjatron: i am trying pod racing thing
 Scarfield: what language?
 Juuiiccee: Java
 Ninjatron: i cannot see any movement
 Ninjatron: but it says i win
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Husoski, you might try on #fr, they are pretty good at ruby
 Scarfield: i dont know java, but to output a direction for thor to move: System.out.println("SE");
 Scarfield: the "SE" is of course what you need to determine with your script
 Ninjatron: it leveled me up, but i didn't even see my pod move
 Juuiiccee: thats the weird part, I have it determining which way for him to move then I am passing the direction as a string to the print statement but he just dosent move when i play a testcase
 5DN1L: what does the console say
 Scarfield: do you output every turn?
 Ninjatron: it says my rank is 1 and boss's rank is 2 at the end of the race
 5DN1L: how about you, Juuiiccee? what does the console say?
 5DN1L: Ninjatron I have no idea about your case
 Juuiiccee: I looked at the console and figured it out thank you so much
 5DN1L: Good
 Husoski: Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker Thanks! (I think...my French is rustier than my Ruby)
 Scarfield: same, maybe a browser bug that wont show the game (?)
 Scarfield: :muscle: Juuiiccee
 Husoski: #fr
 Juuiiccee: I forgot to initalize the string to blank lmao I feel pretty stupid about now, thank you 5DN1L and Scarfield!
 5DN1L: you're welcome&#160;:)
 Scarfield: xD np all our mistakes are stupid :p
 5DN1L: Ninjatron so you're in Wood 2 League now? I see the leaderboard doesn't show you have any score or past battles, kind of weird really
 Ninjatron: it was the absolute first challenge
 Ninjatron: where you change y to x
 5DN1L: yes, that's correct
 Ninjatron: my pod didn't move, but it said i won
 Uljahn: might be unsupported browser or some addons interfering
 5DN1L: somehow he's in Wood 2 league now
 Ninjatron: I am using Netscape
 Ninjatron: 1999 version
 5DN1L: huh????? o_O
 Ninjatron: :D
 Scarfield: xD
 Ninjatron: just a joke, i just use chrome 
 Ninjatron: so now i didn't even get what was I supposed to do in level 1
 5DN1L: i dunno, maybe try Firefox
 Ninjatron: i change x to y and now i am in wood 2 league?
 Ninjatron: did I miss any learning then?
 Juuiiccee: Ahhhh now I see what you mean I have to update thors position manually
 5DN1L: not really
 Ninjatron: that's fine then
 Scarfield: yes Juuiiccee&#160;:) i missed it as well back when i started
 Ninjatron: my rank was just 60k something
 Ninjatron: i clicked play, lost and now my rank is 52k does it make sense?
 5DN1L: Which rank are you talking about
 Uljahn: you clicked "Test in arena", that's the cause
 Ninjatron: nope i didn't and now it is back to 60314
 Ninjatron: i clicked play again and my rank is 42466
 Uljahn: hmm, there might be battles in progress in your league, so they interfere with your rank
 Scarfield: Uljahn :taco:
 Juuiiccee: thor just does not want to stop going on that angle straight off the path
 5DN1L: You're his controller :P
 Juuiiccee: good point, I thought I was updating his position so that he can change direction but I guess not
 5DN1L: You can print variables to error stream to debug if needed
 Juuiiccee: ah I didnt think of that, thank you
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Juuiiccee: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 Juuiiccee: oh wait it was something I messed up while trying to debug, thank you
 Fureot: lol
 5DN1L: no probs
 Ninjatron: i don't understand what this Map Pod Racing wants me to do
 Ninjatron: i get x, y, destx, desty, angle etc.
 5DN1L: did you read the statement?
 Ninjatron: then it tells me to output the target's position
 Ninjatron: yes
 5DN1L: the statement explains it all
 5DN1L: you output where you want your pod to go and the thrust you want your pod to have
 5DN1L: you aim to race around the checkpoints a number of times and be the first to do so
 Ninjatron: i understand that, but how granular it should be?
 Ninjatron: i want it to go towards the next checkpoint
 5DN1L: the requirement isn't too demanding at the lower leagues
 Ninjatron: the thing is my pod isn't even moving at all
 5DN1L: what does the console say
 Ninjatron: my output never changes
 Uljahn: Ninjatron: click "replay and share" and post the link
 Ninjatron: meh nvm i will figure later 
 Ninjatron: i think i was thinking that next checkpoint auto updates
 Ninjatron: i think it only changes when you reach the "next_checkpoint"
 Uljahn: yep
 Ninjatron: it still leaves granularity problem
 Ninjatron: if nextX and nextY are say 100 100
 Ninjatron: and my x y are 0 0
 Ninjatron: what should I print?
 Uljahn: nextX and nextY define the direction of movement
 Uljahn: turn on the debug mode in settings
 Ninjatron: ok
 Wontonimo: so, if the checkpoint is 350 500, you should print 350 500
 Wontonimo: it really is that straight forward
 Ninjatron: ok so currently, as is that's what I am doing
 Ninjatron: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + thrust)
 Ninjatron: and nothing happens, no movement
 Wontonimo: you need a space after the Y
 Ninjatron: i am creating thrust as a string with a space ahead
 Ninjatron: thrust = " 100"
 Wontonimo: if you are targeting 350 500 100 but your print will print350 500100
 Wontonimo: ok
 Wontonimo: i see, you treat thrust like a string
 Wontonimo: refresh your screen
 Uljahn: or copy-paste your code here
 Ninjatron: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b6a07a6b-8f7c-4824-9dfa-d18d7410b2d7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b6a07a6b-8f7c-4824-9dfa-d18d7410b2d7</a>
 Ninjatron: i don't understand now it works
 Ninjatron: but I haven't changed anything
 Ninjatron: the exact thing that I did 1 minute after opening the challenge didn't work
 Ninjatron: now it passed, which is literally just the if else in problem statement
 Ninjatron: ok... so if I didn't misundertand everything else is on this screen no next screen or anything
 Ninjatron: which means, that I can optimize this by calculating velocity based on the distance to next checkpoint and so on
 jacek: or you can use different target based on your current velocity
 Ninjatron: aren't you supposed to go the next checkpoint in order
 jacek: yes, but do you need to go to always exactly into the center of next checkpoint?
 Ninjatron: or are you telling me to try optimize the route based on my x y and the target destination's coordinates?
 jacek: sometimes next checkpoint + 50 pixels right or top is better
 Ninjatron: right, forgot that checkpoints have a radius so a touch is enough then?
 jacek: yes
 Ninjatron: cool thanks

 Magmi: what game do you recommend if i like clash of code
 jacek: what is your programming level?
 jacek: in mad pod racing, you can advance few leagues using bunch of ifs

 Ninjatron: well, I have a question about the bot race
 gwuliano: what is it
 Ninjatron: what do neural networks have to do with this?

 gwuliano: You talking bout line racing?
 Ninjatron: mad pod
 AlkhilJohn.: hey mods
 AlkhilJohn.: How'd life
 AlkhilJohn.: Enjoying the usual
 Wontonimo: you don't need NN for mad pod racing Ninjatron
 Wontonimo: the people who use Neural Nets for Mad Pod racing do the training offline
 Ninjatron: I thought Wontonimo was bot lol when I was awarded for making a comment midnight
 Wontonimo: antiwonto is
 Wontonimo: i, on the other hand, am a real boy
 Ninjatron: in order to graduate from Bronze do I need to rank 1 consistently or what?
 Wontonimo: beat the boss
 Wontonimo: on a completed submit
 Wontonimo: if you resubmit before the last one is done, then it does't count
 Ninjatron: beat the boss in test in arena or what? currently my rank is 1 but nothing is happening
 Wontonimo: your submit isn't completed
 Wontonimo: it's only 65% done ... wait for it to complete
 Ninjatron: i see
 Wontonimo: cool.  looks like you'll be in silver soon
 Ninjatron: nice

 Ninjatron: the guy who built this site apparently is self-taught but couldn't find a job because of lack of diploma
 Ninjatron: I have commonalities
 Ninjatron: I got a diploma but can't find a job lol
 StraumliPerversion: keep looking.  this is the best time in history for finding jobs
 Ninjatron: i applied to hundreds of jobs already
 Ninjatron: only got 1 offer
 Ninjatron: technical interview won't always go perfect, but i get rejected with even perfect technicals
 Ninjatron: they say "culture fit" "team fit"
 StraumliPerversion: oh, they just don't like you for some reason? 
 Wontonimo: do you know what that means?
 Ninjatron: no? that I am too handsome?&#160;:)
 Ninjatron: what does it mean really
 StraumliPerversion: it is sort of the opposite of saying he's a nice, friendly guy
 Ninjatron: but I never say something rude during interviews
 Ninjatron: and i am quite friendly
 Ninjatron: i got the weirdest rejections too, in a recent instance, it was "The team had a positive feedback for you, we decided not to move forward" :D
 StraumliPerversion: I don't know.  Maybe you are too loud or too quiet.  Probably your friends know what the problem is, make them tell you
 Ninjatron: my friends are baffled, some might be thinking maybe i am an idiot at this point
 StraumliPerversion: I recommend you do a video call with Wontonimo to figure it out
 Wontonimo: try punching less.  also give less wedgies when at the interview.  throw fewer glasses ow water
 Ninjatron: lol
 Ninjatron: you'd think i am being a smartass or obnoxious but none of those things
 Wontonimo: maybe you are ugly.  that can happen.
 Wontonimo: jk
 Ninjatron: lol 
 Wontonimo: no, seriously though, that sucks
 Ninjatron: i am balding, but probably 7.5/10
 Wontonimo: ha!
 Ninjatron: i know, a guy i know is hideous
 StraumliPerversion: if it is technical and the resume is good enough to get you in the door, it pretty much has to be personality
 Ninjatron: he drives bus now
 StraumliPerversion: *isn't technical
 Wontonimo: see if you can get a friend to do a fake interview at their place of work and give you honest feedback without the pretence of hiring.

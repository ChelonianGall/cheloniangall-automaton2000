 ninjadip: have you already done WFC struct
 ASM_MOV_INT: wave function collapse? is there a puzzle for that on here... um, cool!
 ninjadip: yeah, Wontonimo made it
 ninjadip: cool name
 ASM_MOV_INT: where is it at?
 ASM_MOV_INT: please
 ninjadip: used to love me some int 13h, or int 0x13
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 ninjadip: ASM_MOV_INT
 ninjadip: for me it was int 13h, in inline ASM in turbo pascal, to call up the famous 320x240 graphic mode for DOS
 ninjadip: pretty sure it was 13 hex...
 ninjadip: lol
 ASM_MOV_INT: whenever my apple iic would crash I would end up getting a brute force intro to machine language and assembly...
 ninjadip: oh yeah, i started programming on a apple iiG
 ASM_MOV_INT: found it... classic hard....
 ninjadip: i know about those crashes
 ninjadip: crazy
 ASM_MOV_INT: awesome! rofl
 ASM_MOV_INT: ctrl-reset
 ninjadip: for some reason they put a gui on the slowest computer in the world..
 ninjadip: lol
 ninjadip: and decided to have BASIC as the backbone?? i didn't get it
 ninjadip: was that what was going on?
 ASM_MOV_INT: i never saw a iig
 ninjadip: one very, very, interesting fact about the Apple IIg was that it had the same exact processor as the SNES! so they used the Apple IIgs for development at a lot of game developers that didn't want to buy the excclusive Nintendo dev kit
 ninjadip: oh
 ASM_MOV_INT: interesting
 ninjadip: It was in color, had a GUI, a very slow, very  slow gui
 ninjadip: but they were windows  that could move and be resized
 ninjadip: so it was multi-tasking
 ninjadip: you could have a few things running
 ninjadip: and it wasn't any slower, lol
 ASM_MOV_INT: oh yeah, .... shoot, I guess the apple iic did have an interpreted BASIC environment on startup
 ASM_MOV_INT: ProDOS...was officially the name of the OS according to wikipedia
 ninjadip: i just remember whenever i would crash inside of the Pascal compiler i would end up inside of some weird BASIC shell that I didn't understand at the time 
 ASM_MOV_INT: that wasn't even my first computer
 ninjadip: it took like a minute to compile a hello world program
 ninjadip: so imagine when it gets more complex
 ninjadip: that was my first computer science class
 ASM_MOV_INT: lol, I didn't actually take computers at school... since I grew up with one... until typing was required in high school, but I caught on to typing without looking pretty quick
 ninjadip: i got forced with a ruler
 ninjadip: no, it wasn't that bad
 ninjadip: but i had a computer at home too, but i was a pecker, until that typing class
 ASM_MOV_INT: lol
 ninjadip: some pun intended
 ninjadip: might as well ask a programming question in the middle of the ranting
 ninjadip: do i need this friend keyword to override a ==operator?
 ninjadip: what does that just let me look at the private data in the comparison without having to use getters?
 ASM_MOV_INT: friend classes can access private data from classes to which they are friends, yes.
 ninjadip: awe, isn't that cute, friends
 ASM_MOV_INT: so friendly
 ninjadip: never heard about while learning of inheritence, 
 ninjadip: seems like a sloppy work-around
 ninjadip: am i wrong?
 ASM_MOV_INT: it's like making data public between two friend functions
 ninjadip: yeah, i don't like it
 ninjadip: but i get it
 ASM_MOV_INT: kind of like a friendly global umbrella
 ninjadip: yeah globals are ugly too, try to avoid them at all cost
 ASM_MOV_INT: yeah, they make a language that hides the data behind privacy.... then add stuff to the language to break it
 ninjadip: except in CoCs , globals and anything else fly
 struct: no i never tried wfc
 ASM_MOV_INT: thanks for the walk down memory lane, I'm playing some practice puzzles
 struct: at least i dont think so
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm working on wfc in a private project for graphics or world creation
 ninjadip: oh cool
 ninjadip: for a homebrew game you're working on?
 ASM_MOV_INT: yes
 ninjadip: trying to figure this debug out
 struct: what is wfc used for?
 ninjadip: does 35 3x3 distinct patches seem right for a 6x10 prototype?
 ninjadip: ASM_MOV_INT
 ASM_MOV_INT: not sure, i've not started in my experiments with it yet, but sounds like it might be? 
 ninjadip: yeah i'm thinking
 ASM_MOV_INT: originally wfc is used in quantum mechanics
 ninjadip: i guess i should just print them to test what i got
 ninjadip: it's getting late here
 ninjadip: i got a good start
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm doing this at work, and i still have an hour to go
 ASM_MOV_INT: ...then i can get distracted playing games at home
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 ninjadip: having a class for my 3x3 patch and overiding the == to compare helped make the rest of the code cleaner
 ASM_MOV_INT: robert heaton has some nice explanations for wfc as well
 ninjadip: i was telling Wontonimo i saw this youtube video that made it all click. and they started off by using a sudoku grid and rules to explain the concepts
 ASM_MOV_INT: cool
 ninjadip: it really helped for me, cause i love sudoku and understand how that works and i could see the link
 ninjadip: just never used the words they use in WFC to describe it
 ninjadip: the quantum words
 ASM_MOV_INT: it's a great algorithm that can be as complex or simplified as you want.  you can train the computer to learn everything from the input in patterns, or manually code the rules, or combination, etc.
 ninjadip: yeah, learning from patterns does seem to have its advantages
 ASM_MOV_INT: probability of a given pattern, when more than one pattern is possible, plus rotation of patterns.... oh boy
 ASM_MOV_INT: haha, i was just about to complain that easy puzzle took me 40 minutes.... then I got 100%!
 ASM_MOV_INT: :sunglasses:
 Isomizer: it very hard
 derjack: thats what she said!

 BlaiseEbuth: baguette
 Wontonimo: Luka has been banned
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: what ninjadip&#160;?  you got the patches for WFC done?  tell me more&#160;!
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: luka has been banned?
 struct: jacek on bt you only have 1 hidden layer right?
 jacek: 2
 struct: ok, i have another question, i was watching a video yesterday about nn on number recognition and output was 1-9
 jacek: difference is slight but better
 struct: on bt what does the output look like?
 struct: is it like an eval?
 jacek: i only use value the the output is tanh, so (-1,1)
 struct: is it the same for games with draws?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: you can somewhat interpret it as probability of winning
 struct: thanks
 jacek: number recognition, so it was probably mnist
 jacek: where output layer had 10 nodes
 struct: oh yes
 struct: 0-9
 struct: seems impressive though
 struct: that NN can play so well early with only -1, 1 values as output
 jacek: umm, it is from -1 to 1
 struct: ah
 struct: so I missunderstood
 jacek: for opening positions it'll give something like 0.05 for white, or -0.03 for black
 jacek: digit recognition is classification. the value stuff is regression
 struct: so you dont have an "output layer" right?
 jacek: my output layer has 1 node
 struct: I see
 struct: is tanh the value from the 2nd layer right?
 struct: I dont know the terms
 nicola: Yes, luka talked to me as if I were a snotty kid.
 jacek: value from sum/dot product from 2nd layer
 struct: ye
 struct: thanks for explaining
 nicola: On #fr, then here after his first ban.
 nicola: Do you want the translation of what he wrote here in French?
 struct: I dont think you need to justify the bans nicola
 nicola: No, but I can explain if needed.
 nicola: :grin:
 Wontonimo: oh, i was just announcing the ban because it wasnn't visible.  it looked like the right move to me nicola.  my reason for announcing it was so people know that behaviour isn't acceptable and has been dealt with
 Uljahn: well deserved
 ninjadip: hey Wontonimo, does 18 distinct patches sound right for the first prototype?
 ninjadip: i've got them stored now, and i looked at them, they look right, visually printing them, now i'm working comparing them to the partial while calculating entropy
 Wontonimo: let me check.  that would be good for me to add to the hints&#160;!!
 ninjadip: find the lowest entropy match and then take the patch that has the lowest entropy right? and repeat, repeat, repeat
 Wontonimo: sans shannon entropy!  in other words, no entropy calculations.  only constraint reduction
 ninjadip: well idk who shannon is, lol, i thought that meant without rotations or flips
 ninjadip: i already have the code in the patch class to compare entropy to another patch
 ninjadip: if i don't need it, i'll leave it in for me, for a latter project
 ninjadip: it will make it easier without it
 ninjadip: i'll try to finish it by the end of the day
 ninjadip: bummer you only get 50xp for it
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: sup
 jacek: entropy isnt what it used to be&#160;:(
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i have a very cool idea that i want to do one day
 Wontonimo: ninjadip , I get 47 unique cards from the example

 Wontonimo: I added it to the contribution in the hints section.  it is now the 3rd hint (in rot13)
 Wontonimo: what are you talking about eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers&#160;?  I thought you were talking about the python adventure game
 ninjadip: i thought the cards were 3x3
 Wontonimo: they are
 Wontonimo: i just concat'ed them onto one line each for brevity 
 Wontonimo: you'll notice that each line is 9 characters.  that makes a 3x3 patch
 ninjadip: oh ok
 ninjadip: they aren't that easy to read like that, but i got you
 ninjadip: i'll have to figure out whats up

 Josdel: see u
 p.p.o.p.: I don't think the clashes should require us to have prior knowledge. The one I just did seemed to require knowledge of Hex&lt;--&gt;ASCI translations with no description
 p.p.o.p.: Obviously syntax knowledge!
 p.p.o.p.: But not non-coding knowledge
 Wontonimo: it is knowledge of the computer hardware, and assembly, and the basis of all programming code
 Wontonimo: so, i'd say that's some good background knowledge to have
 Wontonimo: a "byte" is 2hex, and ascii is the original conversion of 2hex into printable characters
 p.p.o.p.: Oh. So interested. I had no clue! Just doing some self-learning over here...need to read some books
 p.p.o.p.: *interesting
 jacek: learning from clashes eh?
 p.p.o.p.: I do find it useful!
 p.p.o.p.: The puzzles are far more useful. Clashes far more addicting. 
 p.p.o.p.: I think the clashes would be more useful personally if it was all C# so I could more easily make sense of others' code, but that is also useful
 Blokops: you must really hate short mode clashes
 ninjadip: i hate smallest code
 jacek: whats what she...
 Blokops: can you please lests dont?
 struct: what?
 Blokops: btw does anyone know when the cp points are edded?
 struct: 1am france time
 Blokops: too bad i dont speak french 
 struct: 1am italy time
 Blokops: ah gotcha
 Blokops: so around 5pm in mtd
 Blokops: soooo any recomendations for the optimization/bot problem that i should tackle&#160;?
 Blokops: tackle next *
 5DN1L: depending on what you like or what you want to learn/practise?
 Blokops: so far i done A*frok and code of legends
 Blokops: and both where a pain
 Blokops: more code of legends
 Blokops: anything more simple
 Blokops: actually i need to do the mars lander
 Blokops: since i also need to do mars lander part 3
 5DN1L: Do that then?
 Wontonimo: i like 2048 as an optimization
 Blokops: looks simple enough
 Wontonimo: but don't do an optimization if you are not interested in optimizing code by doing things like inlining if/else into multiplies to make branchless code
 Blokops: my first guess is that someone outthere aleady made some guides to get a high score in the game
 Wontonimo: 2 words:
 Wontonimo: sn
 Wontonimo: ake
 Blokops: on that thougth there should be a snake optimiazion game
 Wontonimo: and a third:beam
 Blokops: the old phone game
 Blokops: beam search?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: i should rewrite mine.  my bot uses dfs.  bleghk
 Quidome: you can use dfs with itterative deepening though
 Blokops: maybe some A* to limit the depth
 Wontonimo: it's just hard coded to 5.  does pretty well
 Wontonimo: 33rd / 1043.  not too bad
 Blokops: for being hardcoded 33rd place sound good
 Quidome: got to position 54 with dfs+&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 Scarfield: hard coded :o instant mod privilege removal!
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: my answer isn't hard coded, just the depth
 Scarfield: phew
 Wontonimo: i don't think there is enough space to hard code all the moves for 2048 and get a reasonable score
 Quidome: But for me the evaluation function was critical
 Wontonimo: oh yeah, for sure
 struct: just NN it
 Scarfield: oh you talking about 2048, i still havent tried that, should get into it sometime
 Quidome: didn't manage to get your snake idea working&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: my snake idea?
 Quidome: on 2048
 Quidome: maybe i did not understand what you meant
 Wontonimo: &gt; &gt; &gt; vv &lt; &lt; &lt;&gt; &gt; &gt; v
 Quidome: yeah that
 Wontonimo: where * is your largest num
 Quidome: i did understand&#160;:)
 Quidome: but did not get my eval function producing that behaviour
 Wontonimo: my eval function scores the first position in the top left as 3^0, then the position to the right is 3^1, then 3^2 , etc
 Wontonimo: whatever value is in that position gets multiplied by the 3^n
 Quidome: Hm, gonna think about that, maybe try it  
 Wontonimo: having a '2' in the top left is worth 3^0*2
 Quidome: yeah I got the idea
 Wontonimo: i also only ever explore 3 directions.
 Manchi_o6o7: has someone some experience with the eigen library in c++
 Wontonimo: the 4th direction is dumb
 Quidome: just got a descent position on bulls and cows that wasn't that hard&#160;:)
 Quidome: gonna work on that one first a little bit more. Thnxs for the tips btw
 p.p.o.p.: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/106d6707-03f0-4c10-bbbe-d9a6889dbcd1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/106d6707-03f0-4c10-bbbe-d9a6889dbcd1</a>
 Wontonimo: you need a correctoin
 Wontonimo: i'll post, just a sec
 Blokops: why thrust ==99?
 Wontonimo: Console.WriteLine(nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointY + " " + thrust);
 Wontonimo: you forgot a space between y and thrust
 p.p.o.p.: I was just testing to see if it was something to do with the string being too long because the sample has a space at the start " 80"
 struct: Manchi_o6o7 it seems they have a discord server
 struct: maybe you will get better luck there
 p.p.o.p.: Oh okay. Thanks Wontonimo!
 p.p.o.p.: I tried putting the space in the the thrustString
 Wontonimo: yeah, but you don't use that variable
 Wontonimo: just delete it
 Wontonimo: I mean delete the variable thrustString
 p.p.o.p.: I see!
 p.p.o.p.: Okay!
 Wontonimo: submit your bot so i can see it in the leaderboard&#160;!
 p.p.o.p.: Are you talking to me Wontonimo? I'm 2408 haha so pretty low. Don't know how to submit it.
 Wontonimo: talking to you about your mad pod racing
 Blokops: a tip for mad pod is that you can remove the boss bot and put other peeople bots to see how they do it
 Blokops: btw whats the last quest of bot/optimization?
 Blokops: is it to reach legendary?
 struct: just to get to the next league
 Wontonimo: reach top 2% of optimization, then top 2% of code golf
 p.p.o.p.: I think I'm ranked 3 in this league but that doesn't feel right
 Blokops: not to brag but im top 200 in code of golf :yum:
 Blokops: could reach more if i took my time to learn a new langauge
 Wontonimo: yup
 Blokops: p.p.o.p. wood leage go by really fast
 Wontonimo: almost there ppop
 Wontonimo: don't reduce your thrust to 0.  perhaps 30
 Blokops: i would argue to reduce it to 0 but lower the windows it stays at 0
 p.p.o.p.: Okay&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yeah, nevermind.  
 Wontonimo: do try detecting how far away the checkpoint is, and if it is really close then slow down.  maybe if within 800 then slow down to thrust 50
 Wontonimo: gtg  bye!
 ninjadip: oh man i love pod racing!
 p.p.o.p.: bye. Thanks for helping!
 ninjadip: yes if close, slow down, play with the numbers until you find what you like
 p.p.o.p.: but then I could see getting stopped so I am setting a bool outside the game loop to let me know if I'm approaching
 ninjadip: i recommend making these two variables global constants to make them easy to change later. like DISTANCE_TO_SLOW_DOWN=800 APPROACH_SPEED=30
 p.p.o.p.: Okay, thanks!
 ninjadip: i love some pod racing
 ninjadip: could talk shop on that forever lol
 p.p.o.p.: yeah this is fun. Unfortunately I have to go be social but would rather keep doing this to be honest 
 ninjadip: i get it
 ninjadip: pod racing was my first CG game, it sucked me in
 ninjadip: what's going to blow your mind later is that you can be faster without ever slowing down for checkpoints but by having adaptive steering that will auto correct for you to account for drift
 p.p.o.p.: oh wow. I don't think i'm good enough at math for that! 
 ninjadip: yeah, that's what's cool about the leagues
 ninjadip: you don't need to do that to beat wood league
 ninjadip: lets you build on your logic in increments
 p.p.o.p.: create a wave function that goes through the two points?
 ninjadip: doesn't even need to be that insance
 ninjadip: insane
 ninjadip: it's really simple, but you need to get past wood league first
 ninjadip: and i will help you figure out how to do drift together
 Blokops: you dont need that much math until silver
 ninjadip: i think gold is where real math and logic come in
 ninjadip: with only one ship, you only have to think, go fast lol. with two ships you have options
 ninjadip: makes me want to get back into it, but i had to put it down..
 Blokops: currenlty trying to beat gold but im stuck trying to recreate the "checkpoint_angle" varaible that was taken off
 ninjadip: yeah
 ninjadip: want me to share that
 ninjadip: i can't remember but i think i had a atan2 in there for that
 Blokops: maybe after i lost all hope
 ninjadip: float angle = atan2(p1.y - p2.y, p1.x - p2.x); angle * 180 / PI 
 ninjadip: the second part turns it into degrees
 struct: you can always check csb bible if you want to write a sim for it
 ninjadip: use your cordinates and the checkpoint cordinates in the formula
 Blokops: awesome, legend league here i go!!! 
 ninjadip: i liked that method, was the simplest
 Blokops: after i finish the homewokr of course &gt;-&gt;
 Blokops: this webpage is really triggering my adhd
 ninjadip: sorry
 Blokops: been trying to do the homewokr for 3 hours now
 ninjadip: i keep looking out to watch the snow
 p.p.o.p.: What ranking do you need to advance to the next league?
 ninjadip: have to beat the bot
 ninjadip: the evil looking guy
 ninjadip: usually it's like number 1
 ninjadip: or sometimes multiple can beat the boss at the same time
 ninjadip: he's called Boss, right?
 ninjadip: once you beat the boss, there is a cooldown period before you advance, for wood league it isn't that long
 p.p.o.p.: It says the boss and I tied for first
 Scarfield: After your submit has finished, your score has to be higher than the score of the boss to rank up
 p.p.o.p.: Got it. I think I just need to test it in the arena. We'll see
 p.p.o.p.: I was doing it in my IDE
 Scarfield: IDE "tests" wont rank you up, only submits with higher than boss scores
 p.p.o.p.: Oh god. Im looping around the station haha
 p.p.o.p.: like a moon in orbit
 Scarfield: mad pod racing?
 p.p.o.p.: haha yeah
 p.p.o.p.: *BEGINNER* mad pod racing
 Blokops: make sure that when you get reallllly close the speed is low
 Blokops: (around 30)
 Scarfield: no need for that actually, check this out: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732">https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732</a>
 Blokops: no better close AND the angle is grater than emlets say 50%
 p.p.o.p.: I've got less than 300 speed at 50, less than 200 speed is 20, less than 100 speed is 5
 p.p.o.p.: oh yes blokops
 p.p.o.p.: thats the solution to my orbit
 Scarfield: you should check out my link p.p.o.p. fpr some "better" appraoch, anyway im off, good night&#160;:)
 p.p.o.p.: Thank you Scarfield!
 Blokops: that moment when you can close a bunch of tabs afyter finish homework
 LovinLifee: ich mag schwzne
 ninjadip: mine is due sunday, probably start tomorrow
 p.p.o.p.: In the bronze league and my pod is sitting at a cool 22,458th on the leaderboard
 ninjadip: sweet
 dmuraco: same
 ninjadip: be that underdog
 dmuraco: ninjadip
 ninjadip: yes
 ninjadip: sorry
 ninjadip: in headphone world
 ninjadip: coding for wfc
 ninjadip: i'm right there, so close
 ninjadip: nvm, i think i have to rewrite the logic
 p.p.o.p.: what is wfc?
 ninjadip: wave function collapse, and i've been working on it for too long on and off
 ninjadip: bout to quit
 p.p.o.p.: Sounds hard. Is it for animation, modeling, or something? Or is it a codingame challenge?
 ninjadip: it has a wide variety of uses in procedural generation
 p.p.o.p.: cool! One day i'll understand all this stuff
 ninjadip: could feed it a pattern of 4 tiles that have adjancy rules that make it generate some cool stuff
 p.p.o.p.: Nice like art? Patterns? Game worlds?
 ninjadip: omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 p.p.o.p.: You got it?!
 ninjadip: so i literally was in the process of deleting my logic for it, and in the process i see that i have a coding error that while checking for lowest&lt; whatever i never updated this new_lowest variable in the for loop
 ninjadip: so of course the logic after the loop never got the right input
 ninjadip: i fixed that, and now it works&#160;:)
 p.p.o.p.: awesome. that feeling is the best!
 ninjadip: had to Ctrl-Z
 ninjadip: to undo my angry delete
 ninjadip: lol
 ninjadip: so crazy, that's never happened to me
 p.p.o.p.: oh wow. That was down to the last minute!
 ninjadip: literally one line of code from completing but finding out after giving up while still being able to save it
 C26_1: Hello everyone
 Blokops: oh wow my rank skyrocket 
 C26_1: I have a question
 Blokops: whats your q
 C26_1: Does update my computer (Windows Update) makes my comp slower?
 Blokops: eh<a href="/index.php?title=User:Chat_Log&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Chat Log (page does not exist)">Chat Log</a> (<a href="/index.php?title=User_talk:Chat_Log&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Chat Log (page does not exist)">talk</a>)
 C26_1: Cuz 748.6 MB
 C26_1: @Blokops, ok thnk you
 C26_1: thank*
 Aaronnotsharon: can anyone help me with the ASCII Art puzzle
 BobLob: How do we know if we can help?
 Aaronnotsharon: actually nevermind I think I got it figured out lol
 BobLob: Glad I helped.
 python-kitten: hi
 DSG_prozkillz: stfu
 BobLob: That's a bit rude.
 DSG_prozkillz: yess man
 Wontonimo: take a break DSG_prozkillz
 Wontonimo: you'll be able to rejoin in about 5 min
 Wontonimo: "How do we know if we can help?" lol
 BobLob: Sorry, I'll take a break too, boss
 Wontonimo: what?  no that was funny
 BobLob: I know, but I'll still take a break&#160;:)  It's only fair
 Wontonimo: why?  as far as i can see, you've called it like it iis
 Wontonimo: what have you been working on BobLob&#160;?
 BobLob: Nothing exciting here.  Just doing the stuff that pays the bills.\
 Wontonimo: nothing here pays bills&#160;!
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BobLob: Oh, that's not true at all.  You have your roguelike, right?
 Wontonimo: a prototype, yeah. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/">https://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/</a>
 Wontonimo: i made a few small mods today
 BobLob: Spit and polish can take any of that to big bucks.
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: no, i got a day job.  I've tried my hand at making products and running my own business.  Regular employment is where its at.
 Wontonimo: the rogue thing is just for fun.  totally free
 DSG_prozkillz: yo can yall talk about that in a pc
 BobLob: Sure thing, would you like to join us?
 DSG_prozkillz: no
 BobLob: Your loss is our gain.
 DSG_prozkillz: by all mean
 DSG_prozkillz: means^
 zophia2222: hi
 Wontonimo: wdym "talk about that in a pc"&#160;?
 DSG_prozkillz: privte chat
 zophia2222: ya
 zophia2222: where is andres?

 MACKEYTH: I have succeeded in making my Atari Go player worse than random&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: zophia has been banned
 Wontonimo: no posting zoom calls to questionable meeting rooms
 Wontonimo: how did you make it worse than random?
 MRGDisGOD: hallo can i ask u something about moad pod racing?
 MACKEYTH: Tried to implement a depth 2 minimax. Now it seems to be allergic to capturing.
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'd be happy to talk about mad pod racing
 Wontonimo: atari go , or atari go 9x9&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: 9x9
 Wontonimo: what?  my random bot is better than yours
 MACKEYTH: Yep. My old random bot was #7.
 Wontonimo: well, it isn't entirely random
 Blokops: speaking of mad pod racing ~ ~ ~
 Wontonimo: yes yes&#160;?
 Blokops: could i get a hint on how to calculate the checkpoint angle in relation with the pod angle
 Wontonimo: its given to you
 Wontonimo: it's the angle
 Blokops: gold take sit away
 Wontonimo: no way
 Blokops: it only gives the pod self angle
 Wontonimo: oh yeah
 Blokops: treid using this math.atan2(next_checkpoint_y_1 - y1, next_checkpoint_x_1 - x1)
 Wontonimo: what does that give you?
 Blokops: some small number 
 Blokops: after putting it through this
 Wontonimo: radians
 Blokops: (angle * 180 / math.pi) - angle1
 Blokops: it gives and angle but is not right
 MACKEYTH: Remember it'll be mirrored, since y increases downward.
 Wontonimo:&#160;! ^^
 Blokops: uh
 Blokops: that explains a lot
 Wontonimo: maybe
 Blokops: but now that i have the angle how do i make it in respect to the ship angle
 Wontonimo: (angle * 180 / math.pi) - ship_angle
 Wontonimo: %360
 Blokops: right now the final question of how can it be cut into 180

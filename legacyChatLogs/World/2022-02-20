 C26_1: Hello everyone
 C26_1: PostgreSQL hates me again
 C26_1: It didn't make have a ENUM datatype
 C26_1: Instead, it needs CREATE TYPE ENUM first
 C26_1: then you could apply that to the table
 C26_1: I mean it is absurd when storing ENUM like that
 C26_1: Like if you forgot your ENUM then it would be waste your memory
 C26_1: And..........
 C26_1: Is there a way to setup calculation when create table in SQL?
 C26_1: I have a table like here

 C26_1: What should I do in the CREATE to auto calculated the Total column
 C26_1: Knowing that the Total column is = Quantity*Price
 abt8601: Not really familiar with databases, but you may want to check out computed columns
 DaNinja: calculated fields go in queries and views, not in Create

 Wontonimo: any word on how much longer world chat will be around?

 R_212:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: many new users are randomly chosen to not have access to world chat
 jacek: :tada:
 Wontonimo: I bet that has the side effect of stoping school kids from using this as their chat tool, because only some of them can get on and so it isn't ideal anymore
 SandmanSW96: lol that's kinda messed up to do it randomly
 struct: oh no my c4 is not even on top 10 anymore

 CKGussin: I've just looked online for how to do Horse Racing duals but I need a bit of explanation on how it works.  I know we initialize an array and then its sorted from smallest to highest strength but how is the difference in strength worked out.
 CKGussin: Also not sure how to link code blocks to here
 struct: arr[i + 1] - arr[i];
 struct: If you wanna code on local ide you can use this to sync the file
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>
 struct: or you can just copy paste, the testcases / validators are not synced though
 CKGussin: So the first part of that is going through the list from weakest to strongest and then it takes it away from the current index?
 CKGussin: Im not sure what i &lt;n -1 means 
 struct: i &lt; n - 1 = go from 0 to n - 1
 struct: n = the array size
 struct: So you will loop from 0 to n - 1
 struct: So if the array is 1, 4, 6, 7;
 struct: you will check
 struct: 4 - 1; 6-4; 7-6
 kovi: struct: i played chess, space shooter and code keeper lately
 struct: The closest strength is 7-6 which equals 1
 struct: nice, chess doesnt seem easy at all
 CKGussin: Ah it does the numbers next to it after its sorted
 CKGussin: because its trying to get the best matchup
 CKGussin: Okay I think I understand now, Is there a name for this type of search?
 struct: hmm not sure
 struct: The goal was to go for less complexity
 struct: if you did 2 for loops which was needed without sort
 struct: it would be O(N^2)
 struct: with sort it will be O(n*log(n))
 struct: since its the complexity of the sort
 CKGussin: So there was a simpler way to do it?
 struct: sort is the simpler one
 Scarfield: kovi :taco:

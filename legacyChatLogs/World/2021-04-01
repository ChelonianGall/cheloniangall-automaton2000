 Manah3.deb: I tried to understand to fault but I can't see where is the problem and how to fix it
 shaimaaabugosh: I need to prove my skills, I'm a beginner so can you plz tell me what games should I solve
 Manah3.deb: shaimaabugosh begin by tor
 Manah3.deb: power of tor
 Uljahn: ye, try to solve "Power of Thor" and "The descent", then try "Coders strike back"
 Manah3.deb: someone can help me for shadow of the knight&#160;?
 Uljahn: use binary search
 WOLFRAHH: I don't solve it
 Manah3.deb: like radix binary&#160;?
 WOLFRAHH: it pathfinding or i am solving puzzle with math problem
 WOLFRAHH: Manah3.deb
 Uljahn: Manah3.deb: go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1</a> landing page and look through External resources: Multidimensional arrayBinary search2D Binary Search explained by Gaurav Sen 
 Manah3.deb: ok thanks everyone&#160;!
 Manah3.deb: I will read
 Uljahn: Manah3.deb: your code is almost there but some features are different
 the_tiger: hello

 Uljahn: Automaton2000: hii
 Automaton2000: i don't think it's a bad idea
 codeing: hey do someone know how to minify python programme&#160;?
 codeing: something like python minifier
 Uljahn: for CG codegolf/shortes clashes?
 JSboss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=python+minifier">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=python+minifier</a>
 JSboss: but to be competitive in code golf you usually need to rename input functions etc above what a minifier can do
 JSboss: at least for js
 Uljahn: for py3 you could start with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/code-golf-python/</a>
 Uljahn: also you can try to utilize the fact that the number of utf-16 symbols&#160;!= the number of bytes
 AlexS2k10: ggggggggggggggggggggg
 Zpanotix: how can be a width of a letter?:worried:
 Uljahn: in ascii-art?
 Zpanotix: yes
 Uljahn: each letter is represented by a 2D array of ascii chars
 Uljahn: those are given in inputs
 Uljahn: row by row
 Zpanotix: I got it thx:thumbsup:
 Mil27Coder: hi
 Astrobytes: Hmm, Amazons gone from Contributions?
 jacek: since few days

 Pseudope: hi there, is there any ctf-like game on this website&#160;? 
 jacek: ctf?
 Pseudope: capture the flag
 AntiSquid: Breach LOL
 AntiSquid: well by a long stretch of imagination at least
 AntiSquid: or try codingame reverse engineering puzzle
 AntiSquid: what ctf sites do you frequent Pseudope&#160;?
 Pseudope: I don't play ctf-games myself, I just wanna bring a friend who wants to play ctf-games x)
 AntiSquid: so which ctf sites does he know of&#160;?
 AntiSquid: there's codingame escape, but you need an invitation link or someone else to host it for you&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/806451125216739328">https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/806451125216739328</a> Pseudope

 AntiSquid: non-permanent games? what? no such ctf site
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Pseudope: nope&#160;:( she loves the crypto part

 Ordonnateur: Hi, is there any way to train SQL in codingame&#160;?
 AntiSquid: :thinking:no
 Ordonnateur: :cry:
 AntiSquid: neither is excel
 Ordonnateur: I get reckt by a lot SQL question in codingame industry evaluation so I was hoping there was some way to train as the langage can be use ^^'.
 davilla: codewars has SQL
 AntiSquid: it's easy @_@
 AntiSquid: what are the CG questions about&#160;? subqueries&#160;?
 Ordonnateur: Well there is any type of question&#160;: write a code, what's the result, choose code/result between checkbox, what does something in SQL (checkbox or not), etc ^^'
 AntiSquid: ah basic
 AntiSquid: you should be able to pass that then if it's multiple choice
 AntiSquid: thought you have to write your own queries or find the mistakes and fix them
 Ordonnateur: Well, i don't know what's the diff with basic or not in sql ;p (but the time limit is often short &lt; 15 min so it's not ultra complex yeah)
 AntiSquid: if it's multiple choice for a subject then they are testing basic understanding of it
 Ordonnateur: there isn't a lot of case where there is checkbox, it's more write the code often (or at least the big part to get point is here xd)
 IHasArms: :grinning: hey
 AlexTornado06: slt les bg
 AlexTornado06: ^hey bro byour are a kiko lol
 AlexTornado06: hey bro you are a kikoo lol
 Uljahn: Ordonnateur: i guess you can try to solve puzzles in python using sqlite3
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh&#160;? Do you think your code has the rights to create files&#160;?
 JSboss: lol
 Uljahn: why not? those files aren't permanent though
 Uljahn: also with sqlite3 you can create a database in RAM
 BlaiseEbuth: Are sqlite even included on cg&#160;?
 Uljahn: it's in python standard library
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Ok.

 Scarfield: looks like it could be similar to the PacMan contest&#160;:'(
 AntiSquid: looks familiar
 BlaiseEbuth: Totoro&#160;!
 Uljahn: PCR!
 AntiSquid: ah thought it's from "Made in Abyss"
 AntiSquid: cute art, but a horror manga
 Scarfield: PCR could be nice, still havent made a bot for that. but doubt it will be physics based contest(?)
 AntiSquid: if it's like PCR , Made in Abyss is the more likely reference :P
 AntiSquid: wait, it's still 1st of April :thinking:
 jacek: made in abyss? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: good manga / anime
 jacek: i knows
 jacek: i didnt know youre weeb
 AntiSquid: not a weeb#

 ZarthaxX: he has been away a lot tho
 Scarfield: yea
 BlaiseEbuth: Thx :kissing:
 Scarfield: i offered blaise a new avatar as well, he didnt like it 
 BlaiseEbuth: Were copyright issues...

 BlaiseEbuth: Welcome back fox
 jacek: oh my
 LaZeta: So, the theme for CSC 21 is here, really beautiful with cute little creatures. Meanwhile what they represent? let's find it out :grinning:
 jacek: could these be ponies?
 Scarfield: warmongering christmas critters?
 LaZeta: :joy: would love to hear what they are
 LaZeta: Jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: Rototo they are. Confirmed by an internal source
 Preuk: where should I report a problem I've encountered with IDE?
 LaZeta: Thanks BlaiseEbuth
 Westicles: The acorn gives it away
 BlaiseEbuth: Report here Preuk, so we can laugh a little. :3
 LaZeta: Hope it won't be about optimizing "Acorn Collections" for the Squirrels 
 Scarfield: probably will be im guessing, hopefully not "PacMan 2"
 BlaiseEbuth: Brew acorn potions
 jacek: why not, pacfield
 Scarfield: because we already had pacman 1
 Preuk: Just did report on discord&#160;:  Using Java, I tried using Charsets.US_ASCIIwhich gets auto-completion from IDE and auto-import on org.apache.commons.io.Charsets;. So far so good.But when running I get "error: package org.apache.commons.io does not exist"
 MadKnight: BlaiseEbuth is such a kind mod
 Preuk: There might be some inconsistency between IDE config and libs config for Java
 LaZeta: Then same is MadKnight
 jacek: cg java has apache commons? o.O
 jacek: MadKnight is such a kind div
 Preuk: Dunno, but autocompletion thinks so
 MadKnight: wiw
 MadKnight: wow
 LaZeta: lol
 LaZeta: and same are other :wink:
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we're not coming back
 Automaton2000: there's also a pastbin after x chars
 jacek: AutomatonNN is better
 LaZeta: Na
 jacek: hm?
 LaZeta: getting frustrated with it pasting abilities
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't compare me to him, if you want to stay alive.
 jacek: to modknight?
 LaZeta: Oh I am sorry, was that me?
 BlaiseEbuth: :rage:
 LaZeta: I am talking about Automaton2k
 BlaiseEbuth: nvm
 LaZeta:&#160;?
 cegprakash: a wild ceg appears
 cegprakash: what does it mean new theme has be released
 LaZeta: Probably nothing
 Westicles: they replaced the default cover art with the real one
 LaZeta: Exactly, a replacement 
 LaZeta: good luck then
 orangesnowfox: It's a cegprakash
 jacek: O:
 Nerchio: i've heard it will be UTTT except acorn theme

 djsapsan: Hi. In chess do we have function for moving piece or do we need to write it for ourselves?
 jacek: i think there is option you can request available moves
 djsapsan: its only for the current position. I wanna move pieces in the future
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah yeah AntiSquid, I added MIA to my "plan to watch" list.
 BlaiseEbuth: You need a Delorean for this djsapsan
 jacek: huh? you can only print one move to current position. which move, you need to make bot and search for that yourself
 djsapsan: i have Tenet
 AntiSquid: ya no rush, manga is released very slowly and the anime probably has only 24 episodes which doesn't cover all the manga yet
 djsapsan: thanks @jacek
 jrke: can anyone suggest me vector animation websites?
 AntiSquid: i searched some earlier for diff project and it said free but asked for payment @_@

 jrke: yup for my multi
 jacek: should i revoke my approval?
 jrke: nope i will update it till tommorow if i succeded else i will leave it as it is
 jrke: also my lost child ep2 idea is ready

 Mformento: Am I the only one who does not get the puzzle of the week? nuggets numbers :cry:
 AntiSquid: yes
 Mformento: damn , sad
 ErrorRazor: Highly unlikely, there are plenty of kids on the website&#160;:)
 Illedan: Mformento want hints?
 Mformento: if its not against ToS! :joy:  I'm an intermediate software developer/sys admin, I'm sure there's a very obvious answer but I can't get to it I feel like
 Illedan: Check dynamic programming&#160;:) 
 Mformento: ooft that seems like quite the hefty read ahah
 jacek: thats quite broad term
 TheSavages: im a noob lol and i have been coding for maybe 10 years
 Uljahn: the puzzle is solvable by brute force btw, i used a sieve-like approach and gcd properties
 Zlastwolf: Hi, I would be very grateful to know how can I remove a programming language from my profile?
 MadKnight: Zlastwolf just go to your profile settings and remove it
 MadKnight: ezpz
 jacek: yeah nobody wants to admit he knows js
 Stormalix: .
 MadKnight: nobody -&gt; they* know js* jacek fix your inglesh
 MadKnight: fix my * jacek i did too many *'s
 MadKnight: the 2nd * is a typo
 Zlastwolf: @MadKnight, I tried but it doesn't remove it from the programming languages
 MadKnight: Zlastwolf how did u try it&#160;?
 Zlastwolf: I went to profile setting as you said 
 Zlastwolf: I removed the programming language from skills
 Zlastwolf: prolly deleting and re-creating the account may solve it. my acc is still new tho&#160;:/
 MadKnight: lol well
 jacek: mk, who are you talking to?
 ErrorRazor: Wild guess: he's talking to the people he pinged
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 imagine talking to people
 Automaton2000: euler do you think it is a really bad idea
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 MadKnight: that's right Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i should have done this
 jacek: AutomatonNN what about euler
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a solution for Platinum Rift 2 with the one in the first place&#160;:
 jacek:&#160;:&lt;
 jacek:&#160;:&gt;
 ErrorRazor: Tfw my c++ is too slow for a puzzle that many people have solved in python..
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not the C++ that is slow. Imo
 ErrorRazor: "my c++" = the code that I wrote
 BlaiseEbuth: So your algorithm&#160;?
 ErrorRazor: I suppose
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 BlaiseEbuth: What puzzle&#160;?
 ErrorRazor: Roller coaster
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Yes, some optimization needed. 
 jacek: what a roller coaster of optimization
 ErrorRazor: Hahaha.
 Smelty: ^^
 ErrorRazor: I can do like 1,7m of the 9m rides
 Uljahn: there are cycles which you can memoize i guess
 ErrorRazor: The queue never returns to the starting position before I time out
 Uljahn: add pragmas, easy boost 
 ErrorRazor: Done
 jacek: :scream:
 ErrorRazor: Without pragmas it's 500k
 ZarthaxX: ErrorRazor prob have a bug
 ZarthaxX: using a map or array?
 ErrorRazor: Array
 ZarthaxX: check if u have a bug
 ZarthaxX: well, idk how are you actually using that array
 AntiSquid: how the hell does one remove Tags from a contribution @_@
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN wtf
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code for the contest
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN you should try hacking, it might suit you :thinking:
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a replay of the game I submited a bit
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN just google it, that is the wisest answer anyone ever given me
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see how the code is going to be like something in the paper?&#160;:(
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN try printing it
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code to solve the problem with the full contest in the conte
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN i am not sure what you mean by that, are you cheating again??
 AutomatonNN: when he considered my experience and added a few days ago
 ErrorRazor: AutomatonNN how many nodes do you have
 AutomatonNN: when i complete the program and then completely read the description
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: hhhhhhhhhhh
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN reading the description is for losers
 AutomatonNN: and returns a stack for the last test case
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN try hard coding, they say it is good
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the problem with the simulation of the game or something?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: help me figure out why it does only more chances of moving to the wrong array
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: why do you think that there is a problem with the output of the contest?
 Yassine_EL_HOSNI: Good night AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN:   is your simple algorithm to find the code in the contest&#160;?

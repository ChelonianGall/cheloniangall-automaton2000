 MadKnight: he probably meant this kind of time
 MadKnight: not exactly now
 theroot99: how can i end the currrent buttle to start another one fastly?
 MadKnight: no way
 MadKnight: is your current battle so slow? why&#160;?
 theroot99: i love you bot any way hhhhhh

 c0cainee: I didn't lose, my mouse died in the middle of the clash
 MSmits: and you were stricken with grief
 MSmits: losing a pet is hard, I know
 MSmits: Basil, nooooooo

 letsaladeen: Hi
 letsaladeen: I was solving the Mars lander - Episode 1.... I am not getting the Outputs for the sample 3 turns at all
 letsaladeen: can some body help me understand?
 darkhorse64: Paste your code in the chat
 Quidome: Did someone solved bender 4?
 Quidome: Can you go with bfs alone or do you have to put in other tricks as well?
 Quidome: I am at 60% at the moment getting time-outs
 emigr2k1: HOW IS EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Quidome: GREAT!!!!!!! 
 MSmits: quidome, ask euler when he's on, it's his puzzle
 MSmits: Illedan probably solved it too
 jrke: just bored
 MSmits: I'm hyped. Having my first AI class in 10 mins
 MSmits: on zoom
 Quidome: Can I join&#160;:)
 MSmits: nah, i am not the teacher, just a student here
 MSmits: otherwise you would of course be welcome
 Quidome:&#160;:)
 wlesavo: MSmits wow grats 
 wlesavo: oh, i thought you was the teacher
 wlesavo: still nice :slight_smile:
 MSmits: no, this is a requirement for becoming a CS teacher
 MSmits: I was supposed to do a different class, but it got cancelled, too few participants
 wlesavo: how long will that take?
 MSmits: so now I do AI...
 MSmits: 5 classes, bunch of assigments and an exam
 MSmits: a few months
 Quidome: There seems to me a bug in my ranking. My bot programming detail doesn't add up tp the bor programming total...
 jrke: exam&#160;!!!!
 Quidome: Anyone else having the same
 Quidome:&#160;??
 MSmits: Never checked it Quidome
 MSmits: too much to add up :P
 wlesavo: so you probably will be ready to start teaching next year?
 Quidome: Aha, I have only 1 line&#160;:)
 MSmits: I am teaching this year, but no degree
 Quidome: so that was easy
 MSmits: I have a degree for teaching physics, but not CS
 wlesavo: oh, so you already teaching cs as well, i missed that
 MSmits: yeah I taught 4 hrs a week
 MSmits: last years of high school
 MSmits: 17-18 yr olds
 MSmits: mostly did python this year. Pretty basic
 MSmits: though some students obviously can do a lot more
 wlesavo: i only had a pascal in my school, still was nice to try, many people didnt have even that
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: most schools have some form of it now though
 MSmits: allright, I am off to zoom, ttyl&#160;:)
 wlesavo: gl
 MSmits: thanks
 emigr2k1: are you awake
 WINWINWIN: Anyone here knows how to import the random module in C#?
 WINWINWIN: Am trying to write a random search for CSB and I need random number within a randge
 dbdr: WINWINWIN I expect it's there, you just need to use it as normal
 WINWINWIN: Do I have to import the module?
 WINWINWIN: and is it like python with randrange?
 dbdr: I don't use C#. did you try to google your question?
 WINWINWIN: Yes, cant find any good doc
 Shurishe: using System;var rnd = new Random();var randValue = rnd.Next(int from, int to)

 WINWINWIN: thanks dbdr
 Friedchicken: hi,I am new here.somebody could tell me how can i do this
 Centrius: just look at hints and write that basi algorithm
 Centrius: you just need to adjust power by checking v_speed
 Uljahn: use -3Vel ezpz, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and he said he is not the best option
 Anower: hi 
 Anower: i am new here
 cegprakash: hi
 aCat: hello Anower
 cegprakash: welcome
 Anower: thank you bro
 Anower: where from you&#160;??
 cegprakash: gold bosses use random&#160;:(
 cegprakash: is there any bot in gold that does play the same moves every game?
 cegprakash: I use a constant seed and constant no. of simulations
 cegprakash: but the games are diff under same conditions
 cegprakash: for eg. choosing same spawn positions every game
 cegprakash: why was a boss chosen with random&#160;:\ how did it even qualify to be gold boss
 struct: He was at the top
 struct: I think random is fine
 IAmNoob: is anyone here c++ developer?
 AntiSquid: nope, nobody
 eulerscheZahl: ceg play against yourself and detect if you are p1 or p2for one of them just hardcode your moves
 Uljahn: when was the last time gold boss wasn't random btw?
 Uljahn: also this time it's just python which is so slow you could easily pass with c++ using pragmas :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 dbdr: OOC gold boss could have been deterministic
 dbdr: Uljahn. wlesavo just removed the seed by accident just before, not knowing he would be the boss of course
 Uljahn: sure but i don't think being deterministic is a must have feature for a gold boss
 dbdr: it's nicer
 dbdr: not must have, nice to have&#160;:)
 Uljahn: i'd like to have deterministic UTTT gold boss :joy:
 dbdr: could be done
 dbdr: take a strong bot, seed, limit to 20ms
 dbdr: wait
 Uljahn: xd
 dbdr: I mean, limit to a fixed number of iterations that fits easily in 40ms
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Uljahn: and then just make an opening book agains it
 dbdr: sure :D
 dbdr: if you can do that, you belong to legend anyways
 dbdr: bottom legend if it's your only trick
 dbdr: yay, smells like promotion
 Uljahn: you should win vs top gold bots though
 dbdr: true
 wlesavo: how does promotion smell?
 dbdr: sweet
 Uljahn: like 6 hours delay?
 dbdr: I pushed field3 too
 dbdr: no, community
 dbdr: no delay
 wlesavo: what game?
 dbdr: Tulips
 wlesavo: oh
 wlesavo: nice
 dbdr: you can place anywhere, so it has huge branching, like go
 dbdr: not sure which other games are like that on CG
 eulerscheZahl: no way to minimax beyond 2 turns without pruning
 wlesavo: antisquid submitted stub in D?
 dbdr: as usual
 eulerscheZahl: he usually does that
 eulerscheZahl: not understanding that multiplayers don't count for your language awards
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: not even sure if depth 2 would work
 eulerscheZahl: me neither. but i'm sure beyond won't
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: it actually depends on the map size
 dbdr: 8x8 and 16x16 are quite different
 eulerscheZahl: there are even different board sizes?
 dbdr: all x * y for x and y independently in (8..16)
 eulerscheZahl: any new rules in the higher league?
 dbdr: Statement now says "Welcome among the best! " :D
 dbdr: otherwise I don't see any new rule
 eulerscheZahl: fibonacci scoring, i've seen that before on CG
 dbdr: yeah. cvz right?
 eulerscheZahl: right
 dbdr: I actually did not find it on OEIS
 dbdr: the sequence of partial sums
 eulerscheZahl: can't be
 dbdr: can't?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://oeis.org/A000071">http://oeis.org/A000071</a>
 dbdr: can't not be there? :D
 dbdr: that's fibonacci
 dbdr: not the partial sums of fibonacci
 dbdr: which is what is used
 eulerscheZahl: what are partial sums?
 wlesavo: typescript stub won 6/2 against D stub
 eulerscheZahl: that's sum(fib(1)...fib(n-1))
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: which is equal to fib(n)-1
 eulerscheZahl: which sums do you want?
 dbdr: I might be stupid :D
 eulerscheZahl: inattentive
 dbdr: I'm sure it
 dbdr: 's easy to prove
 dbdr: is it obvious to know it's that?
 dbdr: the funny thing it I've been calculating the sum by hand and not noticing the connection :D
 dbdr: adding one each time my bot crashed
 eulerscheZahl: i computed the first few terms by hand and looked it up. then i was like: fib(n)-1, interesting discovery
 dbdr: publish a paper about your discovery&#160;;)
 dbdr: a revolution in mathematics
 eulerscheZahl: noone will accept it
 dbdr: you'd be surprised
 wlesavo: couple of years too late
 eulerscheZahl: except for junk science journals
 dbdr: I just saw a video about an economics paper published in the best journal by world famous researchers
 dbdr: they made 3 huge mistakes in their excel sheet
 wlesavo: yeah, i have full mail of scientific spam from journals that will probably accept it
 dbdr: which completely changed their main result
 dbdr: it was discovered 3 years later by a student
 eulerscheZahl: i'll hand it to waset then.
 wlesavo: dbdr google the story of Jan Hendrik Sch√∂n
 wlesavo: you'll love it :slight_smile:

 dbdr: fun fact: the referee recomputes the series, and the sum of the series, each time

 eulerscheZahl:  // izpise v error od referreja
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have it when comments aren't in English
 dbdr: I think the theoretical max is 8 * 3 + 1 = 25
 eulerscheZahl: but thumbs up for publishing the code, not everyone does that
 eulerscheZahl: sounds right
 eulerscheZahl: about 75k
 dbdr: there are community multis without the source?
 psylogy: mhoulk please share
 eulerscheZahl: or at least not on github
 dbdr: I have  85         const FIBSUM: [Gold; 25] = [0, 0, 0, 7, 12, 20, 33, 54, 88, 143, 232, 376, 609, 986, 1596, 2582, 4179, 6763, 10944, 17709, 28655, 46366, 75023, 121391, 196416];  
 eulerscheZahl: are you sure about the 75023? not 75024?
 dbdr: fib has 75024
 dbdr: so should be 23 no?

 eulerscheZahl: bonus point if you recognize the language i used to produce this output
 dbdr: ah, I'm looking at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://oeis.org/A000071">http://oeis.org/A000071</a> which already does the -1 :D
 struct: This reminds me of Code vs Zombies
 eulerscheZahl: but you only screwed up somewhere in the middle, at 2582
 eulerscheZahl: i guess at this point it doesn't matter anymore
 dbdr: yes, highly unlikely to matter. but ugly&#160;:)
 dbdr: it would also be nicer to generate them at startup, but that would add one indirection at each access
 dbdr: could be done at compile time, but not worth the effort
 eulerscheZahl: hardcode is fine
 eulerscheZahl: nobody wants to claim the obscure language bonus point?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: for(i=1,25,print(fibonacci(i)))
 dbdr: was looking, but not familiar
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/</a>
 dbdr: how did you get to use that?
 eulerscheZahl: project euler
 eulerscheZahl: i don't use it for larger scripts but it's a great calculator replacement
 eulerscheZahl: and sage (sagemath.org) as the heavy gun
 eulerscheZahl: supports scripting with python
 eulerscheZahl: but replaces a few things, e.g. ^ is pow instead of xor
 dbdr: it's math not programming&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and does exact computations (keeping sqrt and such) unless you round explicitly
 eulerscheZahl: as i said: great for project euler
 dbdr: ah, so it's symbolic?
 eulerscheZahl: sage is
 eulerscheZahl: can also solve equations
 eulerscheZahl: was meant as an open source mathematica alternative
 dbdr:&#160;? sqrt(2)^2 %5 = 2.000000000000000000000000000
 dbdr: looks a bit strange to me
 eulerscheZahl: it even has a rubik cube solver integrated
 dbdr: if you know it's 2 exactly, don't print decimals
 eulerscheZahl: that's pari, which is not exact
 eulerscheZahl: sage is
 dbdr:&#160;? sqrt(-1) %6 = 1.000000000000000000000000000*I? sqrt(-1)^2 %7 = -1.000000000000000000000000000
 dbdr: nice
 eulerscheZahl: and there windows version was just a linux VM for a long time :rofl:
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: their*
 dbdr: - does your program run on Windows?- sure! there you go!
 geouwu: how do i turn on "gory mode"&#160;?

 geouwu: it
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr is the starter code for tulips correct?
 eulerscheZahl: costs for build given in input
 dbdr: I have:
 dbdr: 285     assert_eq!(input.read::&lt;Gold&gt;(), 0);286     assert_eq!(input.read::&lt;Gold&gt;(), COST_GRASS);287     assert_eq!(input.read::&lt;Gold&gt;(), COST_ROCKS);288     assert_eq!(input.read::&lt;Gold&gt;(), COST_FLOWER);
 eulerscheZahl: oops, had a bad readline from refactoring the started :flushed:
 dbdr: you get as inputs, but I think they are constants
 dbdr: so I assert that&#160;:)
 dbdr: maybe that changed during the design
 Quidome: eulerscheZahl, I have 60% now on Bender 4. I am wandering can you solve all these with vanilla BFS or ...
 Quidome: Going to build a testrig first now&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: BFS with lookup to check for double visits
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the boss at the tulips game isn't even stupid :o
 eulerscheZahl: not completely i mean
 Quidome: OK, I have that, must be something wrong then
 Quidome: I am not moving dirtballs al the moment as a first try
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to do that to solve the puzzle
 Quidome: I read that
 Quidome: 60% puts met at place 35
 Quidome: that's weird
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 Quidome: 765 started the puzzl
 eulerscheZahl: play in IDE without submitting anything = started
 eulerscheZahl: i think it scared off some users&#160;:(
 Quidome: yes, ok, still
 Quidome: :joy:

 Matrix007: whys is this wrong
 Matrix007: i cant understand
 Matrix007: new here
 Quidome: do you get an error?
 Quidome: cin gives you string, convert to int??
 Uljahn: you should store and output "i" though
 Matrix007: it didnt give me error but it stopped runnin
 Quidome: i think Uljahn is right&#160;:)
 Quidome: store index and height, reply with index
 Matrix007: i compare with another variable then print the highest variable and does this loop for 8 times
 dbdr: Running out of gold looks too much like a timeout I think
 Quidome: yes, you determine the height of the heighest mountain and reply with the height, you  must reply with the index of the heighest mountain
 Uljahn: just read the rules once again&#160;:)
 Matrix007: i  am still confused but i will try thanks for the help guys
 Uljahn: you just need an additional variable to store index i
 icecream17: Hi. that CSB one line gold thing worked! thanks sooo much
 eulerscheZahl: -3v

 wlesavo: not really though, just wanted to submit in typescript :slight_smile: 
 wlesavo: not sure if ill commit to anythinh before contest starts
 dbdr: I'm just doing it leasurely&#160;:)
 dbdr: planning another top rank wlesavo?
 dbdr: you might do even better in a shorter format
 eulerscheZahl: ice and fire is fun
 eulerscheZahl: or get some rest before the next contest
 Nerchio: what you guys playing again
 Nerchio: it seems something different every day
 Nerchio: xD
 eulerscheZahl: i wasn't playing onitama yesterday
 Nerchio: wleslavo i lost to your bot in silver or bronze in ghost in a cell lol :p
 wlesavo: dbdr no :slight_smile: only if i will got that lucky again
 dbdr: come on, it's not luck
 Uljahn: true
 wlesavo: well i will try my best anyway
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i tried ice and fire quite a while ago, probably it was one of the first multis i tried, didn't really get it, may be i should come back to it
 dbdr: well, what you like is subjective, and there's plenty to choose from
 eulerscheZahl: and soon one more
 dbdr: so probably best to try new ones
 dbdr: game of life?

 MSmits: just received my first AI class assignment
 MSmits: I'm supposed to do the six degrees of Kevin Bacon... calculate how many movies are required to link actors together
 MSmits: so basically BFS I guess&#160;?
 MSmits: with alternating links I guess, movie-&gt;actor-&gt; movie-&gt;actor
 wlesavo: sixty shades of Kevin Bacon
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon</a>
 MSmits: anyways, sounds like a medium difficulty CG puzzle
 Quidome: Make one out of it and you will get tons of solutions&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol, easier to solve it myself&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits we have <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/erdos-number">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/erdos-number</a>
 MSmits: ah yes, that is the exact same thing
 jacek: why is it in baby talk language?
 eulerscheZahl: scroll down for the understandable version
 Quidome: :punch:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm tempted to at least swap french and english
 Astrobytes: "baby talk language" :joy:
 MSmits: I should solve this puzzle 
 MSmits: hmm, should I go with two types of Nodes, or just one type
 eulerscheZahl: a person-node
 MSmits: maybe a boolean to differentiate
 eulerscheZahl: too long ago, differentiate what?
 MSmits: a paper or a person
 MSmits: you can use the same node if you add a boolean
 eulerscheZahl: paper means you have a connection
 eulerscheZahl: i should read the task again
 MSmits: yes but papers have multiple persons and persons have multiple papers
 wlesavo: euler is it possible to update puzzke to split statement in en and fr?
 MSmits: so the two types of nodes are kind of equivalent
 cegprakash: anyone in gold in OOC
 eulerscheZahl: i have 2 classes: Node and Edge
 eulerscheZahl: in my infinite naming creativity
 Quidome: euler is rigth, the person is the node, the paper the edge
 MSmits: ah, that works too
 wlesavo: cegprakash my bot is doomed for gold
 MSmits: yes but you can also do it the other way around Quidome
 cegprakash: which league u in
 cegprakash: gold boss plays randomly and I'm unable to repro the game
 MSmits: papers are also connected through persons
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo you can't split a puzzle the same way as it works for SDK contributions
 MSmits: just as persons are connected through papers
 cegprakash: gold boss shouldn't qualify for a boss
 cegprakash: because of it's randomness
 eulerscheZahl: there you only see one statement, depending on your language selection on CG
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl oh, i see, didnt know that
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl why is gold boss so random 
 eulerscheZahl: set CG to french and then open an official puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash you pinged the wrong user with that question
 wlesavo: i know ceg, i wrote it, sorry that happened
 MSmits: well wlesavo, you didnt select the boss
 eulerscheZahl: also never start a sentence with eulerscheZahl or you will teach bad things to AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: when is the contest report&#160;?
 cegprakash: is it okay to end sentence with eulerscheZahl?
 wlesavo: sorry for that, keep forgeting
 eulerscheZahl: just not as the first word
 wlesavo: also :slight_smile:
 cegprakash: wlesavo do u have a standard version?
 cegprakash: something I can test
 cegprakash: is it possible to swap boss now?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. reach legend to fight it
 wlesavo: dont think that is possible
 Astrobytes: Stop moaning and suck it up ceg, you can do it
 MSmits: cegprakash just try a few players as opponents
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why did u make me traverse the bacon rabbit hole?
 eulerscheZahl: CG can change the boss. but i don't think that they want
 eulerscheZahl: they didn't want to change it during the contest at least
 MSmits: sorry PatrickMcGinnisII

 eulerscheZahl: that's a lot of blue
 cegprakash: oh complaints came during contest also
 wlesavo: it is funny that they cutted the msg but didnot uncomment seed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think dijkstra is better
 eulerscheZahl: BFS is fine for erd√∂s
 eulerscheZahl: as every edge has the same weight (1)
 MSmits: though, I think you need to be careful with python and queues. The list structure is going to have problems
 MSmits: if you pop off the first item in the list, it will shift all elements
 Uljahn: just use deque
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: you need to import that then
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl do you do topcoder?
 eulerscheZahl: very rarelyand don't start a sentence like this
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl okay but why
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps cegprakash around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/35448723594340" /> jacek: AutomatonNN why

 cegprakash: I'm blue too eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of a hackerrank problem
 eulerscheZahl: let me find it again
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/members/cegprakash/details/?track=DATA_SCIENCE&amp;subTrack=SRM">https://www.topcoder.com/members/cegprakash/details/?track=DATA_SCIENCE&amp;subTrack=SRM</a>
 cegprakash: you deserve to be red
 cegprakash: from what I see u on codingame
 eulerscheZahl: never tried hard on topcoder
 cegprakash: I'm 10 yrs active in TC
 cegprakash: and I think 7 yrs now on CG
 cegprakash: only two websites which I'm active
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/world-codesprint-8/challenges/sams-puzzle">https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/world-codesprint-8/challenges/sams-puzzle</a>needs an account to access it, one second...
 eulerscheZahl: where can i upload a pdf?
 wlesavo: googledocs?
 eulerscheZahl: do i need an account?
 wlesavo: yeah
 wlesavo: github?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docdro.id/6Q0qquk">https://docdro.id/6Q0qquk</a>
 eulerscheZahl: so that's somewhat similar to the hackerrank task
 eulerscheZahl: and it was the only hackerrank contest where i won something
 wlesavo: oh, its quite similar to this game <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle</a>
 wlesavo: not exactly but close
 WINWINWIN: anyone who can give tips to get out of silver in fantastic bits?
 eulerscheZahl: share a replay
 AntiSquid: fine tune your if else
 wlesavo: thats how i got ooc legend
 eulerscheZahl: and fantastic bits legend is easier
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454545842">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454545842</a>
 eulerscheZahl: back then bosses were weak
 WINWINWIN: yea, have gone through most pms in the discussion
 AntiSquid: the old pms aren't as detailed though
 WINWINWIN: implemented what worked best but only reaches ~30th in Silver
 eulerscheZahl: flipendo at frame 44 is a total waste
 WINWINWIN: thanks eulerscheZahl(not first word&#160;:) ) 
 duckquackduck: hello, when does the weekly challenge finish? 
 WINWINWIN: on the physics engine, how far does a throw go?
 eulerscheZahl: and at 29 you throw the ball right into the opponent
 AntiSquid: Wednesday&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: throw it sideways
 eulerscheZahl: too long ago that i could tell you now how far you can throw
 struct: Fantastic bits might be the shortest legend code I have
 eulerscheZahl: duckquackduck what weekly challenge?
 struct: 130 lines
 duckquackduck: TWIXT-PP
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle of the week? i think there's a new every wednesday
 eulerscheZahl: not always a multiplayer game
 eulerscheZahl: just a random community contribution that gets promoted
 duckquackduck: ok, thank you
 eulerscheZahl: and you can still play it after
 struct: wtf is wroing with leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: you are not on top of it?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Fmr03jN.png">https://i.imgur.com/Fmr03jN.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: censored
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's the new lb it seems
 struct: I guess its WIP
 struct: I hope
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/s5e5u4">https://prnt.sc/s5e5u4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: works for me
 struct: yeah it works now for me too
 jacek: CSB?
 struct: I guess it didnt load stuff yet
 struct: This was FB 
 eulerscheZahl: but a weird edge on the left
 eulerscheZahl: and the avatars melt into 1 huge picture
 Astrobytes: I'm not overly keen on it, I must say
 eulerscheZahl: i want the old css back
 eulerscheZahl: i might even have it offline for statement writing
 cegprakash: okay I found a constant move bot in gold.. 
 cegprakash: AntiSquid
 cegprakash: AntiSquid will be my testing bot
 MSmits: man, onitama is just as bad as oware when it comes to tuning constants. You can win 80% vs your old version and then do the same or worse on the leaderboard
 WINWINWIN: Fixed flipendo and pushed code ty @eulerscheZahl
 jacek: overfitting eh
 MSmits: I guess so, but i didnt even try that hard. I just fit each constant once and it's already overfitted
 eulerscheZahl: might also be because of different games (cards)
 eulerscheZahl: some constants work better for some card combinations
 MSmits: true, but I fit on CG bench so far
 MSmits: so same card generation function, shouldnt matter over many games
 MSmits: also the graph is consistent
 MSmits: I should just fit against darkhorse, eric, renard etc.
 jacek: going meta again
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: which of the 2 erics?
 MSmits: Eric Cartman
 MSmits: there's only one on the leaderboard :P
 eulerscheZahl: illedan is an eric too
 MSmits: oh right
 eulerscheZahl: or Erik, i'm not sure anymore
 MSmits: probably Erik
 MSmits: they don;t do Eric in Norway
 jacek: maybe in Nandway
 MSmits: jacek, you high again?
 eulerscheZahl: Notway
 eulerscheZahl: no way*
 MSmits: what is Nandway?
 cegprakash: Norway?
 MSmits: oww coder humor
 MSmits: got it
 Astrobytes: nor, not, nand
 jacek: :tada:
 mattshin64: does anyone know how to do a coding challenge through this website?
 mattshin64: I received a link for a coding challenge but it doesnt let me use my codingames account for it
 mattshin64: says i need a work codingames account but I can only make a work codingames account as a "company"
 eulerscheZahl: you got a link to the interview questions?
 eulerscheZahl: and if you click it, you don't get to the questions?
 eulerscheZahl: (i never got the chance myself, just guessing how it could work)
 eulerscheZahl: you could ping Thibaud, but i guess Friday evening is a bad timing
 mattshin64: yea it brings me to a login page
 mattshin64: i try to login with this account but it says it didnt exist
 mattshin64: Thibaud told me its because I dont have a work account, but then how do I create a work account as a candidate and not as a company?
 mattshin64: if i click register, then register as a candidate, it brings me back to the home page for codingames
 mattshin64: been battling this issue for a couple of days
 Astrobytes: You've got a link from your prospective employer?
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, no ideanever used the part of the platform
 aCat: bleh
 mattshin64: looks like a generic link
 mattshin64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/dashboard/campaigns/">https://www.codingame.com/work/dashboard/campaigns/</a>
 aCat: I got the yesterday's idea about quick clases
 mattshin64: something like this 
 aCat: *clashes
 aCat: and people seems complayining
 Astrobytes: mattshin64 afaik the company you've applied for a job with should send the link to the actual test
 eulerscheZahl: we need more context to understand your concerns aCat
 aCat: I'm playing clashes by leaving them instantly
 aCat: someone yesterday said he did that for achiv
 Astrobytes: Shocking behaviour catr
 Astrobytes: *cat
 aCat: to not waste lot of time ;p
 aCat: I know
 aCat: this cat is awful
 eulerscheZahl: and i agree with Astrobytes, that link seems wrong
 aCat: why you are surprised&#160;:&gt;/
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: but why are people complaining about you leaving?
 aCat: they want a fair challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: so mattshin64 you have 2 options:1) contact thibaud again to make sure that the link is indeed incorrect
 eulerscheZahl: 2) tell your employer in spe
 mattshin64: I think the recruiter might have sent me a faulty link
 eulerscheZahl: and get the correct link
 mattshin64: yea I contacted them
 eulerscheZahl: great
 mattshin64: thanks random people for the help!
 mattshin64: this is a nice community
 Astrobytes: Yep I think it's a bad link, good luck when you get the real one&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and we have a contest soon, feel free to join
 eulerscheZahl: starts in 2 weeks
 mattshin64: will do! thanks everyone once again!
 jacek: dont forget to participate in clash and invite euler to it
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: i might even try topcoder this time, looks fun
 eulerscheZahl: thanks cegprakash for reminding me
 Astrobytes: the rotating subsquares thing from earlier?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: rotating subsquares sounds sexy... but no time&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and i already got the rotation code from hackerrank
 Astrobytes: lol, in the bag
 eulerscheZahl: but my hackerrank solver can only rotate in 1 direction :scream:
 MSmits: then just rotate 3 times...
 MSmits: it's a square
 Astrobytes: I think that might affect performance
 MSmits: ofc
 Astrobytes: Shouldn't be hard to implement rotation counterclockwise 
 tobk: Just having a very strange effect in coders of the carribean. my bot's pathfinding will ALWAYS time out against a specific opponent, but not (or just very occasionally) against others
 MSmits: use convert your code to c++ to offset performance so you can keep the one directional rotation
 MSmits: thats the easiest way to fix it :P
 tobk: (meaning that the pathfinding wil abort and just use MOVE X Y as default, not the entire bot timeouting)
 tobk: any ideas what could be the reason for this? the other bot does not behave obviously weird, either
 eulerscheZahl: my performance already sucks i thinkdoing a rotation as transpose + revert
 Astrobytes: My CotC bot is a bit shit frankly, not sure I can help tobk
 Astrobytes: Won't take you long to improve it euler, when's the deadline?
 eulerscheZahl: 5 days
 Astrobytes: Loads of time, get on it
 eulerscheZahl: tobk just reproduce it offline?
 tobk: how, if it's only agains one bot?
 eulerscheZahl: then play against that one bot?
 tobk: when I play against "DeVan" in silver, pathfinding will time out EVERY time. every boat, every move, every game (different seeds, too)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>the toad has something for you
 eulerscheZahl: how to reproduce it offline
 tobk: thanks, will have a look at that
 Astrobytes: Oh you did your toolchain thing
 eulerscheZahl: might be overkill for a game where 1 state is enough
 eulerscheZahl: even got the python requests lib working on tech.io
 Astrobytes: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: docker :fire:
 tobk: but seriously, it must be something about that other bot that makes my bot timeout. how is that possible? maybe a problem with the referee?
 Astrobytes: Most likely something in your pathfinding 
 tobk: oh, wait, I'm dumb
 eulerscheZahl: copy the input given to your botpaste it in the local IDE
 tobk: same problem as recently. I take the start time BEFORE taking the inputs
 Astrobytes: LOL not again :D
 tobk: so opp's time is counted towards my own NEXT TURN's time
 eulerscheZahl: and that bot takes longer that others to compute :D
 tobk: sorry&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: that should be part of the FAQs
 Astrobytes: That FAQ todo list is growing :P
 Astrobytes: woo blackbird is singing right on my windowsill

 Astrobytes: lol, I should have anticipated that one
 Astrobytes: *A Turdus merula is singing on my windowsill
 Illedan: Yo, wazzup?
 Astrobytes: Greetings
 Astrobytes: Did you work any more on your OOC bot Illedan?
 Illedan: Nah, I need a break from that madness :P 
 Illedan: And I got a new apartment, so I have to fix a bunch of stuff in the comming weeks..
 Astrobytes: Oh nice. Same area or you moved somewhere different?
 Illedan: Other side of the town, so about 20 min in car away
 Astrobytes: Ditch the car and get a bicycle :P
 Illedan: Yeah, I don't have a car
 Illedan: But I need to borrow a car to move the shit :P
 Astrobytes: lol, I have that problem when moving too 
 Illedan: I don't want a car big enough for moving anyway..
 Illedan: So I would borrow even though i had one
 Astrobytes: I used to want a small camper-van thing, so I could use it to travel aroudn and camp. But now I think I'd rather stick with the bicycle and travel slow
 eulerscheZahl: i even needed my dad when corona forced me into home officei have a desktop PC at work, quite heavy
 Astrobytes: Yeah, wouldn't have been fun trying to bring that back on your own
 Illedan: I borrowed a car to bring my work chair home 
 eulerscheZahl: well... and i don't have a driving license :D
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Why not?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't feel like i need it
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm dangerous enough on a bicycle already
 Astrobytes: I 'can' drive (if you put me in a situation) but don't have a license
 eulerscheZahl: + the environment impact, not a fan of it
 eulerscheZahl: fossil fules
 Illedan: yeah, but it's nice to have the possibility :P
 Astrobytes: Cause I grew up in London mostly there was no need as public transport or bicycle is all you need there
 eulerscheZahl: i can always order a taxi when i need a car urgently
 Astrobytes: Now I'm in Scotland is a bit different, it takes a long time to travel to the nice parts by bicycle
 eulerscheZahl: still cheaper than taxes + insurance for the car
 Illedan: Yeah, I could bring my chair on the subway. But I feelt it would be worse cause of Corona :P
 Astrobytes: Fair point
 Astrobytes: Promotion this time euler?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: 0 wins vs boss
 Illedan: what game?
 eulerscheZahl: my strat is stupid

 Astrobytes: I must admit I didn't expect the boss to be smart
 eulerscheZahl: surprised me too
 Illedan: I asked him to do it :P
 Astrobytes: lol nice
 Illedan: Think it's 2 or 3 ply minmax or something
 eulerscheZahl: play onitama, i had mercy :P
 eulerscheZahl: at least i'm beating maxime
 Illedan: My hardcoding is even winnning you euler :D
 Illedan: Let me push this
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: This is hardcoded
 Illedan: 10 wins
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and i lost already
 eulerscheZahl: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 Illedan: Look at my strat
 Illedan: and how much I own you
 Illedan: in that game
 Illedan: LOL
 eulerscheZahl: 20k points
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you should do this in the center
 Illedan: nah
 Illedan: others block too fast
 eulerscheZahl: the new cheese
 Illedan: This is the bot I made for him to fix the boss :P
 eulerscheZahl: but why do you interfere with my submit?&#160;:/

 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: I saw I win you and was wondering if it would bring me to wood1 xD
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know, the leaderboard is laggy
 Illedan: 33 point boss and 30 point me
 eulerscheZahl: and the formatting broken
 eulerscheZahl: weird edge on the left
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: helo
 jacek: ohai
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: a
 some_person_that_dan_doesnt_know: aaaa
 eulerscheZahl: be more careful about to whom you say "hi" next time jacek
 jacek: or who i invite to clash eh
 Quidome: hm, this hardcoding trick can be very effective
 Quidome: maybe game rules are not so good
 cegprakash: AntiSquid u track urself?
 cegprakash: if I scare away from mines my bot is too scared and if I'm willing to take risk, I end up dying to mines
 cegprakash: zz
 cegprakash: AntiSquid why do you print "MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA"
 cegprakash: is it a part of ur strategy
 MSmits: it is extra humiliating
 eulerscheZahl: he thinks it would be funny
 eulerscheZahl: some people will never grow up :P
 Astrobytes: It's something anime related again iirc
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: what a weeb, that AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: ah, then i didn't get the reference
 Astrobytes: Nor I
 eulerscheZahl: you asked him?
 Astrobytes: He mentioned it during the contest
 jacek: is this a jojo reference?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i was offline at that time
 Astrobytes: Who?
 eulerscheZahl: do you know about the ship that loaded jojos?
 eulerscheZahl: it sank 208 times
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 MSmits: Astrobytes it also came back up 207 times

 Astrobytes: yoyo's ofc
 MSmits: actually, it's jojo
 Astrobytes: I blame my painkillers
 MSmits: you've got 2 countries vs 1 Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: it's ananas
 eulerscheZahl: not pineapple
 MSmits: yep ananas
 Astrobytes: I actually get on with that one OK
 Astrobytes: Just through exposure
 cegprakash: that MUDA MUDA is annoying
 cegprakash: I need to find a better opponent
 Astrobytes: pineapple is ridiculous. I assume it's because it was a fruit and vaguely resembles a pine cone
 ApenJulius: What do you get if you remove the B in Bananas? Pineapple
 wlesavo: so muda muda does work, people cant debug against you
 Astrobytes: lol ApenJulius
 eulerscheZahl: ananas freely translate to "wet Anne" (Anna nass)
 Astrobytes: All this talk of foreign lands is making me sad. Was supposed to be in Sweden for Midsommar this year
 Astrobytes: "wet Anne" D:
 wlesavo: Ananas comosus
 eulerscheZahl: gotta go, cat tells me to go to bed
 ApenJulius: wish i had a wet anna....
 wlesavo: that sounds even dirtier
 cegprakash: I'll try Bob
 Astrobytes: nn eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: I think Bob is all about if else
 cegprakash: oh yes!! as I guessed
 cegprakash: he doesn't use random
 cegprakash: &lt;3
 cegprakash: wait what
 cegprakash: he is a SONAR guy
 cegprakash: damn
 wlesavo: why you dont want just to do self test first vs second
 cegprakash: me against me?
 cegprakash: I need to know what blunders I do
 cegprakash: I am never doing blunders&#160;:( 
 cegprakash: and I'm at 400+/439
 cegprakash: my silver bot with bugs reached 380 though
 cegprakash: now that I removed bugs, I dropped 30 ranks
 Astrobytes: lots of rng though ceg, you'll need a strong bot to cut through that
 cegprakash: rng?
 Astrobytes: randomness
 ApenJulius: RandomNumberGenerator
 Astrobytes: Random Number Generation, rng, 
 Astrobytes: Never play computer games ceg?
 cegprakash: I only have 2 things on my TODO right now for OOC
 cegprakash: 1) track myself
 cegprakash: 2) mines pathing
 Astrobytes: It's the gaming equiv of luck
 cegprakash: 2 I've no idea
 cegprakash: 1 I'll try now
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl gave a matrix with numbers 0 to 1 with probability
 Astrobytes: Track yourself is same as tracking opponent, but you can disable a feature or 2
 cegprakash: but I have a matrix which has only 0 or 1
 Astrobytes: There's a bunch of ways to approach the problem as always ceg, one size never fits all
 cegprakash: I'm thinking about tracking myself and increase my possible positions
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536ghp4IRno">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=536ghp4IRno</a>
 AntiSquid: MUDA means useless / futile
 AntiSquid: it's merely an evaluation of the opponent
 Astrobytes: Got it
 AntiSquid: jojo is okey-ish a story, but mainly like the hilarious references
 cegprakash: if I know what my opponent would know after my combo then I will know which combo is better
 AntiSquid: also when will haters grow up and appreciate great stories for what they are, format is irrelevant especially when western cartoons are just as popular as jap cartoons 
 AntiSquid: cegprakash just read the output know what i know 
 cegprakash: In my eval I always run away from opponent when I think he can be close to me
 cegprakash: so I waste a lot of silence
 Astrobytes: I don't hate on anime, Akira and GitC were amazing, seen loads of other good shit too. Just not into it much
 Astrobytes: GitS
 Astrobytes: (too much CG)
 cegprakash: instead I can choose to use silence only to confuse opponent
 cegprakash: instead of running away
 cegprakash: okay I add tracking tomorrow
 AntiSquid: this is cegprakash trying to beat my bot and failing:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbXVfFm0pfA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbXVfFm0pfA</a>
 cegprakash: today I added damage map
 cegprakash: I'm going to play Age of Empires 2 Definitive Edition
 cegprakash: add me on steam if u play that game
 Nerchio: good luck
 Astrobytes: Oh and Fist of the North Star and Gundam and all that stuff too, and I was forced to sit through Project A-ko
 wlesavo: so it was a jojo reference after all
 cegprakash: AntiSquid&#160;:@
 AntiSquid: you will never arrive at the truth
 cegprakash: why u hide what u see
 cegprakash: with printing MUDA MUDA MUDA
 cegprakash: and 2 pages later print 42
 cegprakash: I want to see 42 first
 cegprakash: that's what I care about
 cegprakash: I  want to see what u see
 wlesavo: 42 is also the reference
 wlesavo: more obvious one
 stacked: how does one do the rotate first element problem in 44 chars in python
 stacked: does python have a rotate method or smth
 stacked: insert(pop)?
 Uljahn: deque has rotate method and numpy has roll
 stacked: but u dont get those right
 Raluffel: can somebody explain me why i have a red cursor which does not allow me to write in the editor?
 Uljahn: in 44 chars? probably not
 stacked: yikes
 Uljahn: Raluffel: try settings -&gt; edit mode -&gt; classic
 Raluffel: thank you&#160;:)
 Raluffel: nice, it worked, thanks a lot
 Uljahn: stacked: is it some clash problem? do you have the statement?
 stacked: yea
 stacked: wait gimme a sec
 stacked: its like, given N and an array A, print (space separated) the array A shifted to the right by one element
 stacked: Uljahn
 Astrobytes: what's N?
 Uljahn: end, *rest = A; print(*rest, end)
 Uljahn: could be this
 Uljahn: N is length i guess
 Astrobytes: Yeah, makes sense
 Zenoscave: can you print args after star args in python? I thought that was disallowed
 Zenoscave: or is it because of the end kwarg
 Uljahn: it's unpacking i guess
 Uljahn: and star args are used in a function definition
 Nerchio: btw i might push a bot from 2017 from silver to gold xd
 wlesavo: i took 5 guys to uttt gold with me today
 Nerchio: :D
 wlesavo: the bot is deterministic so if you you are also deterministic and have 100% wr against boss it gonna be pushed down for sure
 Nerchio: finished 0.03 pts behind boss
 Nerchio: sad
 Nerchio: i want gold already i need to refactor some stuff xD
 wlesavo: one resub should make it :slight_smile:
 Nerchio: i am already submitting for like 10th time :D
 wlesavo: lol 
 Nerchio: i am losing on some smaller maps too much incrementing
 abobas: how to stop battles?
 MadKnight: they will stop after N battles
 Nerchio: old games have promotions only so rare&#160;:(
 theroot99: hello how can i make the bot play first in the last challeng?
 theroot99: not my bot, i mean win iam testing just
 MadKnight: play in IDE
 MadKnight: hey ZarthaxX 
 icecream17: how was "distance" calculated. because my program before gold (CSB) used distance, but now it's not in the inputs anymore
 emigr2k1: d=x2-x1
 emigr2k1: i get captcha always 
 MadKnight: icecream17 length of vector
 icecream17: ok. and... what's the angle?
 MadKnight: angle to checkpoint&#160;?
 MadKnight: are u only checking if it's &gt;90&#160;?
 icecream17: if (Dist / (Angle + 1) &gt; 3000 {
 MadKnight: this looks weird
 MadKnight: super weird
 MadKnight: u need to improve it

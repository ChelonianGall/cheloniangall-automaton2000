 solaimanope: is there any way to filter out games which have failed? i.e. output in wrong format, segmentation fault, timeout etc.
 thethiny: not that I know of
 struct: Only by downloading the replay
 thethiny: 2n is better than n^2 amirite
 thethiny: 😂
 struct: ofc
 thethiny: out of curiosity:
 thethiny: 4 vars
 struct: var can only be 1 and 0?
 thethiny: boolean, yes
 thethiny: I think this is the smallets NAND you can go with
 thethiny: !A and !B and !C and D or!A and !B and C and !D or!A and B and !C and !D orA and !B and !C and !D
 thethiny: yeah just checked here
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.32x8.com/index.html">http://www.32x8.com/index.html</a>
 thethiny: that's the smallest we can go
 Kellthazar: Yey... for now, first place on my country. XD
 thethiny: well done :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: 6th for mine :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: I got a ding
 thethiny: waddyamean
 dbdr: depends on n&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, chat is back
 dbdr: daily routine by now :D
 eulerscheZahl: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: bad timing with the contest and all
 dbdr: possibly cause by it?
 dbdr: a memory leak for instance
 eulerscheZahl: and lots of new users getting an impression of CG with a broken chat every day
 dbdr: yes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: it always happens at 6:15am
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't sound like a memory leak to me
 dbdr: lol. I should be able to check that in my bot logs
 eulerscheZahl: more like a cron job to kill the chat
 aCat: but the chat IS broken every day ;p
 aCat: the impression is correct
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8af23ea0-e72d-456a-a655-2b994e6cfc15">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8af23ea0-e72d-456a-a655-2b994e6cfc15</a>
 dbdr: not an exact time
 dbdr: but mostly around 6-7 am
 dbdr: actually that's the time it comes back online
 solaimanope: is the ranking algorithm of CG public?
 the_joker_100: what do u guys do when ur pec sees no food??
 the_joker_100: pac*
 aCat: go to the one that he remembers should be there
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc7d736e-b016-417e-a946-62f9a47bdef0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc7d736e-b016-417e-a946-62f9a47bdef0</a>
 aCat: using priorities over distance, last seen, probability it's stil there etc
 the_joker_100: @aCat?? u have a history of wehre ur pac has been to?
 aCat: not exactly
 aCat: see that at the beginning you know where ALL the pills are
 aCat: when you see there isn't one that should be there you remove it from memory
 the_joker_100: so goin to places not yet visited?
 aCat: so there remaining pellets have nonzero probability they still are
 the_joker_100: kk
 the_joker_100: i kinda gotit maybe
 the_joker_100: ty
 aCat: not exactly nnot visited - I could seen them before but went other way
 BetterThanJohannes: Can anyone tell me why once one of my pacs die, i automatically lose, but if the enemy pac dies, the game continues
 aCat: that's basic approach that has lot of things to improve, but shoul give you the start
 aCat: if more questions just ask
 the_joker_100: @BetterTHanJohannes maybe u have not considered alive pacs while giving command?
 the_joker_100: so maybe there is a timeout?
 BetterThanJohannes: I just watched a match, and I lost 1 pac, and sent 2 move commands for my remainig 2 pacs, but still lost the match
 BetterThanJohannes: no timeout, just said i had no pacs left
 the_joker_100: can u share the reaply?
 the_joker_100: replay*
 BetterThanJohannes: here is one example, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460066055">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460066055</a>

 alexandreb09: Hey guys, Can I have some help about a puzzle, I don't understand the answer&#160;?
 alexandreb09: Oups, i just figured it out, sorry
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr we just got the reason on discord
 dbdr: oh i see
 alexandreb09: How some people reach to finish Clash of Code in 14s&#160;?!!
 struct: puzzles repeat
 struct: Some of them are solvable with one line
 alexandreb09: When I finished the game, I was first (nobody has sovle them yet) and now I see they have finished in 14s
 alexandreb09: They already know the answer, unpossible to solve it in 14s
 alexandreb09: Just the tyme to type the line is higher than 14s so the time to understand the problem and solve it, i'm at 2min
 struct: Can you tell me the statement?
 alexandreb09: Me&#160;?
 struct: yes,
 struct: I think like 20% of clashes can be solved in less than 15 sec
 alexandreb09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/12159677b4c2cbaed5f6767ce6f4d5db64e661c">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/12159677b4c2cbaed5f6767ce6f4d5db64e661c</a>
 struct: But there was a time that coc had many bots
 alexandreb09: Does that helps&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and there are some regular clashers who indeed know most problems already
 alexandreb09: I think so, it's obvious
 eulerscheZahl: alexandreb09 the published solutions are only accessible to those who participated in the clash
 alexandreb09: Snif, how can I share you&#160;?
 struct: alexandreb09 also that was shortest mode, thats why the fastest time doesnt matter
 eulerscheZahl: copy-paste the code in the chat directrly
 alexandreb09: His code was&#160;: r=readline;[...Array(+r())].map(_=&gt;([b,t]=r().split` `,t=t*9/5+32,print(b&gt;t?"Higher":b&lt;t?"Lower":"Same")))

 cguzman: so many errors in this challenge puff
 eulerscheZahl: name one of them
 cguzman: I configure the git in Eclipse and execute the Spring2020Main.java in the test folder. What should I do to execute my code in local? 
 DollarAkshay: Hello&#160;:)
 DollarAkshay: Long TIme
 jacek: use intellij idea
 DollarAkshay: no C
 eulerscheZahl: eclipse if fine too
 cguzman: one in C#, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/12159677b4c2cbaed5f6767ce6f4d5db64e661c">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/12159677b4c2cbaed5f6767ce6f4d5db64e661c</a>
 jacek: no C#
 cguzman: yes I can execute it in Eclipse, but it is not clear for me to execute my code in local.
 cguzman: Any help? is it possible to execute my code inside eclipse and see it with the Spring2020Main.java in the test folder?
 thethiny: test
 thethiny: was chat offline for a while?
 aCat: yep
 DollarAkshay: Yup
 AntiSquid: so?
 AntiSquid: hi DollarAkshay are you joining the contest?
 Doju: I finally found the issue
 Doju: thought not the root cause
 Doju: or rather, i found a symptom
 Doju: oh actually maybe not
 Doju: OH
 Doju: YES
 thethiny: gratz
 Doju: the opponent's pacs have the same ids as you do
 Doju: oh for fks sake xD
 Doju: i was storing them in a dict by their id
 thethiny: hahaha
 AntiSquid: i told you your "universe" might be too cluttered
 Doju: That had nothing to do with my universe though
 AntiSquid: not really best idea to stick it all in one place
 AntiSquid: uhm ok
 Doju: and only the fact that i started storing them instead of generating new instances every time
 AntiSquid: was it from outside it?
 Doju: no.
 AntiSquid: you don't have parallel universes in your bot?
 Doju: Actually i was thinking of doing something with that
 Doju: partly just because it sounds funny
 AntiSquid: good, create the multiverse 
 Doju: partly because that might be useful in simulation
 AntiSquid: don't forget to add time travel though
 Doju: i will dw
 Doju: and wormholes
 Doju: and all the good stuff
 thethiny: I don't like parallel universes
 AntiSquid: why?
 thethiny: I prefer save and load
 thethiny: so you can properly shape your future
 AntiSquid: there's 1 where i am #1 and wrecking the ladder, i am fine with that
 thethiny: in that case
 thethiny: there's one where I'm #9999 and wrecking havoc
 thethiny: I don't like that
 AntiSquid: at least you're still alive in this universe, so w/e
 AntiSquid: rofl my new rank
 the_joker_100: lmao
 the_joker_100: the devil
 the_joker_100: illuminati is real then:scream:
 Doju: yeah now it works just fine
 Doju: time to resubmit
 Illedan: Thx for the pushing kovi&#160;:)
 Nerchio: gz illedan :p
 Durkin: aw hell, didn't clean something and have a couple games with memory errors
 thethiny: test
 Doju: How do you guys approach pac cooperation?
 thethiny: Split the grid into n grids
 thethiny: and each pac goes to the closest grid
 thethiny: it makes everything easier
 Illedan: I vote 1 Pac for president
 cguzman: come on Illedan, I now you can be more stupid!
 Quidome: Haha, my Line Of Sight is not considering a looking at my own back&#160;:)
 the_joker_100: is anyone using eval tree??or i m the only one not usin it
 AntiSquid: explain eval tree&#160;:/
 thethiny: I love this line:
 thethiny: return no_warp_distance if no_warp_distance &lt; total_warp_distance else total_warp_distance
 AntiSquid: could mean too many different things
 the_joker_100: like minimax and stuffs?
 AntiSquid: ah ... well probably some is using it right? 
 the_joker_100: idk im just using a whole lot of condition checks
 Doju: @Quidome i don't think my paacs see downwards lol
 AntiSquid: 3k players, what are the chances that only 1 is using it?
 the_joker_100: what approach r u sing antisquid?
 the_joker_100: using*
 AntiSquid: not telling&#160;?
 Quidome: At the moment I don't do search considerring it for attack and defense
 AntiSquid: until after contest
 the_joker_100: coz i feel like my code needs to be re written
 the_joker_100: kk
 AntiSquid: then do it
 the_joker_100: how mayn lines??can i ask that?
 thethiny: @AntiSquid 1 is using what?
 AntiSquid: oh i finally reached 500
 the_joker_100: damnnnnnn
 njaber: I'm working on perfectly deducing the possible positions of the enemy pacs while out of view with all the info I have, this is so much more of a pain then I thought it would have been
 the_joker_100: i thought mine was way too much
 njaber: I'm  at 750 lines
 the_joker_100: lmao im at 300
 AntiSquid: ah ya even 500 is nothing
 thethiny: @njaber keep track of all pellets, if a pellet goes missing in a corner then you bet the enemy is inside
 the_joker_100: and its a mess already
 Tiramon: around 600 right now
 AntiSquid: but lines of code doesn't say anything
 thethiny: I was at 86 yesterday
 thethiny: today I woke up to 462
 AntiSquid: some people write compact bots
 njaber: thetiny that's part of the algo, a pat which I still haven't implemented
 njaber: thethiny
 thethiny: I've been writing this part for 24 hours now&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: and i refactor this so i can read it, therefore i try to keep it shorter
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460159889">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460159889</a>
 thethiny: look at how I die
 AntiSquid: frame&#160;?
 njaber: I'm just having an awful time with managing the potential speed boost and how it affects possible positions
 njaber: I'm not yet at 24 hours on it, but I think I'm at 16 or something
 Doju: At least you're considering other possibilities than furiously speeding every time you get a chance :D
 the_joker_100: @antisquid <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460160476">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460160476</a>
 the_joker_100: one left and u still won/??
 njaber: No I mean not the speed of my bot, I'm still doing, I'm talkign about the speed of the enemy
 AntiSquid: is it a replay about me losing? because if it is then look at my rank first, it's 300+
 the_joker_100: nah man im at 800
 the_joker_100: u definitely won
 Doju: lol you scrubs
 Doju: i'm at 1900
 the_joker_100: my food finding thing sucks
 Doju: (/s)
 AntiSquid: ah i see what you mean the_joker_100, why are you spying on me? :p
 the_joker_100: just checkin man
 the_joker_100: lmao
 the_joker_100: im gonna back off now
 AntiSquid: look at the top 100 bots, not at mine
 AntiSquid: mine is still bugged so won't get you far 
 the_joker_100: yeah
 the_joker_100: ok to grind now
 the_joker_100: cya
 Tiramon: gm prefering speed over switch is getting less wins than expected
 Doju: Oh hold on
 Doju: i think i'm deleting super pellets from the grid 
 Tiramon: let's submit and see ..
 Tiramon: you should do that ... when they are eaten
 Doju: I mean before the first move is even over :D
 Tiramon: thats a bit early
 MadKnight: hey Illedan 
 Doju: I'm always leaving the last pellet at dead ends.. whyy
 Doju: that might actually be more efficient than eating them all but still it's not intended
 eulerscheZahl: fool the opponent believing that there is no more pellet behind the corner as the path towards it is harvested
 eulerscheZahl: then come back in the end game
 Tiramon: ok guess i know why speed reduces my win ratio ...  i'm faster and can't switch ... so i'm faster with suicides ...
 Durkin: xD exactly same doing- dont even have a switch function, just spamming speed- the aggressive chasers hurt
 Tiramon: my previous bot was not an aggressive chaser, but he switch to protect himself and to kill if possible, often enough the opponent then suicided at me&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: will be less successful when you climb in ranking
 Doju: Oh okay
 Doju: my vision function is screwed up
 Doju: that's nice to know
 Doju: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460173507">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460173507</a>
 Doju: yup, definitely no unexplored cells left
 Doju: (last frame)
 thethiny: @eykerscheZahl I faced this issue, was at 80ish now at 500
 thethiny:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: hey eulerscheZahl i fixed a bug in my bot thought i'd let you know just like everyone, don't want to be impolite
 thethiny: hahahahahaha
 Nerchio: chat is for talking antisquid
 AntiSquid: that's what i am doing
 thethiny: 😇
 AntiSquid: what happened to your rank Nerchio
 Nerchio: fixing bugs as always
 Nerchio: or rather changing logic
 AntiSquid: just make sure to let euler know when you're done Nerchio
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN did you fix your bugs?
 AutomatonNN: what is the best way to learn the referee on the chat?
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for letting me know AntiSquid
 Nerchio: hey euler im fixing bugs atm
 Nerchio: thought i'd let you know
 eulerscheZahl: i'm put it on my list. where's the newsletter to subscribe?
 thethiny: [SUBSCRIBENOW]
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: hey is pac_count shows pac in sight of my pac or on the computer screen?
 thethiny: sight of your pac
 thethiny: pac(s)
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: well I am trying to use it to avoid collision doesn't seem to work
 thethiny: how so
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: counting number of my pac's in line and if there coordinates were same for some turns
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: but it doesn't seem to work
 thethiny: I didn't get you
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: I mean to say suppose my pac 0 is in block with pac1 now they were bloacked for say 3 turns as they were blocked there coordinates remain same so with the help of above two condition I would know they are blocked so I can direct them elsewere
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: but this Idea does't seem to work
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i don't know what's wrong with it
 thethiny: Cancelling a move may create new collisions. For this reason, the previous step is repeated until no new collisions are created.
 thethiny: f the pacs are of the same type or belong to the same player, both pacs will go back to the cell they moved from. If the pacs are of different types, they can land on the same cell, but a pac can't cross the path of a stronger pac: it will be blocked.
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: but they seem to go back to the collision due to presence of pellet
 IAmNoob: hi!
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: @thethiny  hey do you mean to say that collision is cleared by game itself
 thethiny: that's what the rules say
 thethiny: but it's not working for me
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: well I am trying to find a way to prevent blocking as my ai works well but the blocking thing make it stuck
 thethiny: if distance to friends &lt;= 2 for 3 turns
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yeah its good but then killing other pallets eould not be possible
 Scarfield: do you pathfind with BFS? if pac on floor cell -&gt; cant go
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: nah men I am self taught coder
 ChrisOz: Hey All, Is there a way of reliably measuring the elapsed time (javascript)?
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b0045b5a-ce9d-4575-887f-14145714800a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b0045b5a-ce9d-4575-887f-14145714800a</a>
 ChrisOz: 'time is not defined'
 njaber: I think it's Date.now()
 njaber: That's what I used when I was using JS
 njaber: I'm not sure of the precision tho
 ChrisOz: I am trying Date.now(), but the difference showing me is less than 10 and it still timesout...
 thethiny: correct
 thethiny: Date.now()
 thethiny: are you multiplying correctly?
 njaber: Date.now() is already in ms
 njaber: Oh, if you have a timeout it's most liekly a bug on CG's part, I had that in JS and that's why I switched to C#
 cegprakash: any meta in bronze yet?
 njaber: Ironically C# was even more broken when I switched
 njaber: now it's fixed tho
 njaber: But it seemslike JS isn't fixed
 DollarAkshay: Im having a bug
 DollarAkshay: One of the super pellet locations is not being sent
 DollarAkshay: IDK why
 AntiSquid: cegprakash:  AutomatonNN 10:31AMwhat is the best way to learn the referee on the chat?
 ChrisOz: hmm.. maybe I will need to switch to c# a well
 njaber: #DollarAkshay Are you sure the pellet hasn't been eaten?
 cegprakash: AutomatonNN is trolling AntiSquid
 thethiny: yes
 AutomatonNN: why do you see the difference between the arrows?
 njaber: #ChirsOz might be worth doing a bit of debugging in case the bug actually comes from your code before deciding to switch
 DollarAkshay: IDk why i am not able to read the last line in python
 DollarAkshay: It was working finr so far
 DollarAkshay: All of a sudden it stopped working in Python
 ChrisOz: I have been debugging for last hour or so and can't see anything
 Scarfield: always assume the bug is on CGs end :p
 AntiSquid: the # create a channel if placed before a word #njaber
 DollarAkshay: I havent changed my readinput function since yesterday
 thethiny: guys you don't need to # to mention someone. The name will auto make the text red
 DollarAkshay: Suddentl cant read the last line
 thethiny: @DollarAkshay do a while loop as follows and check what it shows:
 Scarfield: same league as yesterday?
 njaber: Wait what, how does that happen, I don't even see it
 njaber: I saw someone do that earlier and just copied them
 AntiSquid: click the #njaber
 thethiny: for i in range(100):
 njaber: Oh
 AntiSquid: gz you have your own channel
 thethiny: XD
 njaber: Sad there's no autocomplete on this chat
 njaber: for names
 Scarfield: there is
 njaber: how
 Scarfield: nj -&gt; tab
 thethiny: he said chat not IDE
 AntiSquid: oh and btw #njaber_premium_members_only

 thethiny: njaber
 Scarfield: you cant ping yourself
 thethiny: go and ping yourself
 AntiSquid: no
 Quidome: Is silver opening at the same time as the  contest started?
 AntiSquid: yes
 njaber: Are other leagues opening at the same time as silver or later?
 Quidome: later
 wlesavo: DollarAkshay you reading last line, your debug output doesnot work, if in python use flush = True, you will see the problem elsewhere
 DollarAkshay: @wlesavo You seem to be correct but I cannot understand what you are trying to say.
 DollarAkshay: I should flush after every debug output&#160;?
 wlesavo: print(smth, flush = True)
 wlesavo: i mean print(smth,  file = sys.stderr, flush = True)
 DollarAkshay: Yeah i got it
 DollarAkshay: That might have fixed it thanks

 NapTown: any way to move console to another window?
 thethiny: run locally
 Uljahn: wtire your own browser
 NapTown: helpful
 thethiny: @NapTown javascript and console
 thethiny: make it pop p
 thethiny: pop up*
 AntiSquid: just write a browser extention&#160;?
 Janoxakes: is there a way to know when I kill a pac in a corner? For example, if both end up in the same corner by chance, no previous information where it was 
 Janoxakes: Or would that be completely invisible?
 thethiny: if you see it enter a corner
 thethiny: go inside
 Janoxakes: i mean, without seeing it prior
 thethiny: you can assume it is inside if the pellet is gone
 njaber: NO there's no way expcet inference from othe info
 Janoxakes: for example, I'm in (0,1), the other is on (1,0) and we both get to (0,0) in the same turn
 thethiny: correct
 thethiny: unless they have different pathfinding
 njaber: You'd need to have an algorithm that inferes paths taken from taken pellets, visible cells, etc. and maybe at some point you can be sure the pac is dead
 njaber: I'm working on that currently
 Janoxakes: yep, that's the point i'm trying to get
 njaber: If I use speed "optimally", would I use it every 10 turn or every 11 turns? my bot is currently not working and I'm too lazy to rollback to test it
 Csipcsirip: use it when its available
 njaber: That's not what I asked
 Uljahn: use it every 10 and see what happens
 njaber: "my bot is currently not working and I'm too lazy to rollback to test it"
 Bastett: Have I made a bad assumption here? I thought if I issued a move to a space more than 1 space away, and then didn't issue a command for that pac next turn, it would continue on that path. Is that not right? My pac is just sitting there
 Janoxakes: No, it just moves one turn toward the destination
 njaber: Bastett No you need to issue a destination each turn
 Bastett: well pooh
 Janoxakes: but does not continue later
 Bastett: that explains why my tests were green but the game didn't behave as expected
 Bastett: cheers
 njaber: So, no one has an answer to my easy question? Guess I'll have to test it myself&#160;: /
 tomatoes: 10
 thethiny: yes but sometimes no
 thethiny: 11 turns 
 thethiny: since CD is 10 turns
 thethiny: and usning it requires 1 turn
 njaber: Yeah I guess my question was wether the cooldown included the turn the ability is used
 wlesavo: njaber just use it when you recieved a zero cooldown
 thethiny: you can see the meter on top of your head
 thethiny: let me calculate
 thethiny: usage then 9 turns
 thethiny: so 10 not 11

 njaber: wlesavo That's not what I'm asking, I'm doing a pseudo-predict algorithm and want to know how much an enemy can move in a given time
 thethiny: okay
 njaber: thethiny this wasn't directed at you, thanks for the replay, but it seems like you don't use speed in this one
 thethiny: yes I'm not, I'm using Switch instead
 tomatoes: if you used speed on turn 17 (internal, not frame) , you can use it again on turn 27
 njaber: Ok, it's indeed 10 turns, I ended up testing it
 thethiny: lol
 IAmNoob: at what level i reach silver?
 thethiny: not yet
 IAmNoob: ok:(
 thethiny: silver unlocks tomorrow
 IAmNoob: i speak about my level
 thethiny: oh XD
 Uljahn: 20
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: i near
 IAmNoob: close*
 thethiny: my ranking is decreasing, who's resubmitting?
 thethiny: aBoUt 100 pEoPle
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 Bastett: I think I'm about to shoot up a few ranks. Submission looking good so far
 vronchin: hey python coders, is it possible to import other files: from utils import *&#160;? I've tried but doesn't seem to work?
 thethiny: well done
 thethiny: why do u need utils?
 vronchin: for my functions
 vronchin: to put them in another file, for convenience
 IAmNoob: do it from scratch
 IAmNoob: if you can
 njaber: I don't think you can submit multiple files
 njaber: No matter the language
 IAmNoob: it is not possible
 thethiny: you can't put them in another file
 vronchin: ok cool, many thanks guys
 thethiny: I don't even know how you will "see" your other files
 vronchin: well I'm using the chrome add-on, and I was thinking maybe importing was supported
 Bastett: you'll probably want to process your separate files into one before uploading
 njaber: If you want to get hacky you can stream from an http server and get them at the beginning of the program lol
 vronchin: hahaha
 vronchin: I'll stick to the one file format for now 
 DollarAkshay: is there any whay to tell if my pac is dead or alive&#160;?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: your dead pac is not given in input
 AntiSquid: that's probably the next contest theme DollarAkshay, you get shroedinger units
 AntiSquid: cat units
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: man that would be fun
 AntiSquid: ugh
 AntiSquid: no
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: why contest will be totally random and based on probability
 njaber: A contest where each turn each of your commands has 50% chance of not being processed
 Doju: that'd be fun njaber
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: that's what i am saying it will give braingasm
 njaber: it'd be fun to make predictions for, Idk if it'd be fun to make decisions for tho
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yes
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: both
 Nerchio: i think the game tells you there is a pellet on enemy spot even if it was eaten?
 AntiSquid: why not have a bingo or lottery contest then&#160;? just write a bot that selects random numbers
 thethiny: the Pellet is eaten at the end of the turn
 njaber: have a contest of manipulating chaotic functions to achieve victory
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: import random
 MindControler: AntiSquid thats sounds fun. When can we start?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: and all done
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: in python
 AntiSquid:  /s /s /s /s /s  sorry missed a few line endings
 AntiSquid: inb4 someone creates sarcasta ball multi
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i did not get that
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlv6BrrxD_4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlv6BrrxD_4</a> WaRiOrOfCoDe
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: okay i get it
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: never watched south park
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: till now
 perseverent: can you speed after switch or do you have to wait 10 turns?
 njaber: Wait
 thethiny: wait 10 turns
 perseverent: thanks
 cegprakash: wait what
 cegprakash: switch takes away cooldown :O
 cegprakash: really?
 thethiny: yes
 Krizai: When silver league will be opened, what will be the condition to get into?
 AntiSquid: be above 50% in bronze or defeat the bronze boss afterwards if you fail the initial promotion
 AntiSquid: something like that
 AntiSquid: can't guarantee anything
 AntiSquid: 2700 players in bronze is somewhat unprecedented
 AntiSquid: also you need an avatar to leave bronze Krizai
 Ken_Fool: ^^
 Krizai: Ok, thanx. I'm first time here )
 Ken_Fool: so far my game record says i get +20% winchance vs players with no avatars
 Ken_Fool: jk
 Quidome: 50% in bronze promoted, that's a lot
 AntiSquid: that's the usual 40-50%
 AntiSquid: it's just bronze
 AntiSquid: it's not meant to be hard
 AntiSquid: well not super hard
 Quidome: OK, I was working hard to make the initial cut :D
 Ken_Fool: i was quite surprised that im even in bronze considering how lazy i am
 AntiSquid: you still want to get higher no Quidome&#160;?
 Quidome: Can take a break 
 AntiSquid: and as i said i am not sure it's 50%
 AntiSquid: maybe cutoff is at a 1000 or 700 
 AntiSquid: i don't decide this
 Doju: freaking amazing tip to anybody using python:
 Doju: you can iterate through a list of lists (grid) cell by cell
 thethiny: yeah
 Doju: if you make it a class and give it custom __iter__ and __next__ methods
 thethiny: or you can just **grid
 thethiny: and iterate 
 Doju: well
 Doju: that's a more amazing tip xD
 thethiny: I think it'll be sth like
 Ken_Fool: cant you use the ':' to iterate through? (not a python user)
 thethiny: flat_grid = *[*column for column in rows]
 Doju: oh, right
 Doju: well with my method you can do flat_grid = cell for cell in grid
 thethiny: doesn't really matter XD
 Doju: [] around those btw
 Doju: yeah doesnt really matter
 Doju: Ken_Fool umm not sure what you mean
 thethiny: he meant
 thethiny: for x in y:
 Doju: Oh right
 Doju: yeah but that'll give you a list of rows (or columns) instead of a list of every single cell
 Ken_Fool: ah okay
 Ken_Fool: i rly need to refresh my python, is so much more fun to use compared to c++
 Ken_Fool: but i still suck at c++ and need to practice it ^^
 Doju: python is really cool (although i don't have any experience with any other language apart from autohotkey) 
 Doju: but slow
 Ken_Fool: i had numeric and an intro class in data science with python, that was rly fun tbh
 njaber: How do I use CG's pastebin?
 Ken_Fool: copy something paste in chat
 Ken_Fool:  ⛔ Game end
 Ken_Fool: apparently not
 Ken_Fool: my bad
 Ken_Fool: yesterday it did for me
 njaber: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/748b19f9-886b-4961-9928-cd767c81c30e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/748b19f9-886b-4961-9928-cd767c81c30e</a>
 njaber: Ok nice
 njaber: anyways I don't understand this
 njaber: maybe I'm dumb
 njaber: last line is the debug output
 njaber: Hos is it negative
 njaber: How*
 njaber: Srry for the miss-indented Console line
 thethiny: int speedLeft = Math.Max(LastSpeed - elapsedTurns, 0);
 thethiny: right?
 thethiny: just making sure
 njaber: In that case yes
 wlesavo: ((cooldownMargin / 10) - 1) * 4this is always negative
 thethiny: true
 thethiny: cuz you're using Min
 njaber: cooldownMargin is 1 in that case, so this would be 0
 wlesavo: -0.9*4
 njaber: And cooldowMargin can go above 10 but that's not the point here
 thethiny: (cooldownMargin / 10 
 njaber: it's integer division
 thethiny: is maximum 1
 thethiny: - 1
 thethiny: so 0
 thethiny: plus minimum
 wlesavo: njaber then -4
 thethiny: 0
 thethiny: -1
 njaber: Yes so it's not negative, where does the negative part come from
 jrke: hey my rank pushed back by 600 by submitting same code
 thethiny: @jrke cuz you need to battle your way again
 jrke: means
 wlesavo: how is 1/10 - 1 is not negative
 Bastett: 1/(10-1)?
 njaber: Ohwait I'm dumb this is floor not ceil
 njaber: Yeah ok thanks guys
 jrke: why it happened to me
 thethiny: you will go back to your original spot after 2 hours
 jrke: K thanks
 Doju: I have some pacs and the grid. I need a function that gets the visible cells to a pac based on it's position and the grid
 Doju: Should that function be a method in the grid class or the pac class?
 Bastett: I've got it on Grid
 Bastett: but you can make the argument either way
 njaber: I've got it in a block in another function lol
 shashwat986: jrke so, what normally happens is that whenever you submit code, it resets your rank, then makes your bot fight every other bot, to calculate your new rank. At the time when it's fighting the other bots, your rank will be very volatile, and usually worse, because it hasn't fought as many battles
 Doju: so there's no right way
 Doju: alright, thanks
 MahirSez: Will there be more additional rules in the Silver League?
 Astrobytes: Nope
 Astrobytes: Bronze rules are final: "All the rules are now unlocked!"
 MahirSez: So what is the significance of the Silver, Gold and other leagues to be held next
 Astrobytes: Improving?
 Astrobytes: The bots get better and the leagues get harder
 eulerscheZahl: higher leagues filter the bad players. gives a more stable ranking
 eulerscheZahl: you also get more battles on submit for higher leagues
 AntiSquid: disagree with stable rankings part
 Astrobytes: "more stable" = relatively accurate
 eulerscheZahl: more stable doesn't mean perfect
 AntiSquid: even then legend feels chaotic, especially during contest
 eulerscheZahl: at the end of the contest there will be a recalculation at the top (legend or top100, whatever is less)
 eulerscheZahl: giving everyone approx. 1000 extra matches
 Ken_Fool: can you derank from gold and silver?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Ken_Fool: nice
 eulerscheZahl: except SaiksyApo breaks the league :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: he accidentally promoted everyone from silver to gold last time
 Illedan: Only with database injection :P
 Ken_Fool: haha
 AntiSquid: he deranked everyone that time, makes one wonder why they didn't derank bug abusers that promoted through bugs
 eulerscheZahl: double hulk?
 AntiSquid: ya
 Lulemair: Hello there&#160;:)Is it possible to read visible pellets before Pacmans&#160;?
 Illedan: No
 Lulemair: Arf, ok thanks&#160;!
 Doju: Is it good practice to throw "raise Exception"s everywhere?
 Ken_Fool: not in c++ ^^
 eulerscheZahl: exceptions are slow
 Doju: no i mean for like debugging
 Astrobytes: I donno, if someone finds a bug and uses it, it's kinda the the fault of the game authors right? Hate the game not the player :P
 Ken_Fool: in esports bug abusing can get you banned
 Doju: if something goes wrong you get the exception instead of some other error
 Illedan: Sure, but crashing your  bot makes you lose 100%
 Doju: yeah&#160;:/
 Doju: though i'd like it to crash in testing rather than in running
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes so who's fault was full league promotion?
 eulerscheZahl: #if DEBUG
 Astrobytes: yeah I know Ken_Fool, I'm just being cheeky
 Astrobytes: That was an accident AntiSquid
 Doju: oh right eulerscheZahl that would be a smart thing to do
 AntiSquid: not my fault, shouldn't get demoted for accidentally being awesome
 Ken_Fool: #Astrobytes im also 50/50 on it, i mean kudos for ffinding and utilizing the bug but on the other hand they should fix it in contest and then they have a perma losing bot
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid :D
 Ken_Fool: ^^
 Chitti_01: guys i am just staring this, I don
 Chitti_01: t 
 AntiSquid: now there's an astrobytes chatroom, stop adding the # before user names Ken_Fool 
 Chitti_01: understand why when taking input
 AntiSquid: you don't have to
 Astrobytes: Yeah Ken_Fool, it's kinda more appropriate to report it and get it fixed right
 Astrobytes: lol, AstroChat
 Ken_Fool: okay #Antisquid thx for telling me how to ping correctly ^^
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: you still did it
 Ken_Fool: yeah you can tell me in chat&#160;;)&#160;:*
 AntiSquid: besides it's easier to write the username withoiut the #
 cegprakash:   should we go to #Antisquid channel?
 Astrobytes: I suspect that was deliberate :P
 AntiSquid: write few letters and press tab
 AntiSquid: no, the current channel is #AntiSquid_cashers_only
 cegprakash: #AntTab
 Ken_Fool: AntiSquid thx, somehow i only ever tried Ctrl+Space
 Illedan: #RealGeneral
 Astrobytes: #SecretContestStrategies
 AntiSquid: #leaked_legend_boss
 Ken_Fool: can you guys recommend me a read on pathfinding?
 Astrobytes: redblobgames.com
 MadKnight: cegprakash all alone in #Antisquid channel
 AntiSquid: join him MadKnight
 Ken_Fool: Thx, that site looks intresting Astrobytes
 Aitorcius: why my AI works good locally but when i submit i had only 2 moves
 AntiSquid: it's for those who can't afford premium and enter #AntiSquid_premium
 Ken_Fool: hahaha
 Astrobytes: It covers pretty much everything comprehensively Ken_Fool, with lots of examples
 Ken_Fool: #Antisquid_onlyFans lol
 Ken_Fool: yes visual explanations and examples are always welcome, thank you&#160;:) Astrobytes
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 when is your #onlyfans coming&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i prefer #AntiSquid_only_airconditioners 
 Automaton2000: you are getting close to top 10
 Astrobytes: He has interactive stuff on there to show how the algos work too Ken_Fool
 cegprakash: ppl in my country chat post "Yay! I've beaten AntiSquid's bot"
 AntiSquid: wow
 Astrobytes: Fame squiddo, fame at last
 Nerchio: like its hard
 AntiSquid: that's sad, cheering when you beat a shitty bot
 AntiSquid: go beat top 10
 MadKnight: no, we gotta keep beating AntiSquid
 cegprakash: u are popular everywhere AntiSquid
 MadKnight: it's not a question of glory
 AntiSquid: 2400 people can't beat me in bronze
 cegprakash: ppl freak out about their existence when they beat ur bot
 Nerchio: this must be some kid of troll
 Nerchio: kind*
 AntiSquid: Nerchio no it's not
 AntiSquid: they play vs active chat users
 AntiSquid: somehow that matters more than actually winning
 AntiSquid: yesterday and today people sent me replays of them winning vs me, i even was at #600+&#160;:/
 wlesavo: AntiSquid what a good way to say y have a rank of 200+ :slight_smile:
 Illedan: AntiSquid, you lose vs me.. Fix it<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460291553">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460291553</a>
 Ken_Fool: you forgot the pound symbol&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: #in let's see who's beating AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ya see? i don't care, i know it's bugged lol
 wlesavo: Illedan i actually have an ok winrate against you, but you are to far, only getting a games against #2
 Illedan: You can't take the current ranking seriously. Too many players and too few games.
 AntiSquid: now you sound like "i can't promote because i don't reach the boss" crowd, wlesavo
 Illedan: Also, kovi pushed me very far ahead
 wlesavo: AntiSquid i know :slight_smile:
 Illedan: ValGrowth is beating most of the games..
 Illedan: *me
 tobk: just realized super-pellets are already known... so all my super-pellet-symmetry guessing was useless...&#160;:-(
 Doju: Now i have a function that raises errors if debug and warnings otherwise. Thanks for the idea eulerscheZahl
 wlesavo: but i actually cant promoute AntiSquid :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: his secret is not getting eaten <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/valgrowth?lang=en">https://twitter.com/valgrowth?lang=en</a>
 Aitorcius: i change my code and i pass from 200 moves to 2 moves wowowo
 AntiSquid: maybe if you wreck ille's bot hard enough you reach silver before anyone else wlesavo? give it a try just in case
 njaber: Issou
 wlesavo: tobk that sounds like a title of paper on M theory
 jrke: hey is thereany problem if we continous submit
 Astrobytes: SuperPellet Symettry hahaha
 Astrobytes: *Symmetry
 Astrobytes: P-branes = Pellet-branes
 AntiSquid: there is no such thing as higgs pellet
 eulerscheZahl: jrke is you spam submits, you will get captchas first, then it will be temporarily disabled
 tobk: speaking of symmetry: anyone using the initial symmetry to guess opp positions?
 eulerscheZahl: for up to 6h i think
 jrke: K thanks
 Illedan: ofc tobk
 wlesavo: tobk sure
 eulerscheZahl: i use it to remove pellets
 eulerscheZahl: no tracking yet
 eulerscheZahl: are you guys tracking aleady?
 wlesavo: yeah, a little
 thethiny: I implemented a system that detects if it's a trap or not! Does it work? Yes! Does it avoid the trap? No it just says "TRAAAP" before it dies.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm like: if i can't see the opponent, he's not there
 Doju: hahah thethiny
 wlesavo: my tracking is bad, but it helps
 Doju: that's hilarious
 Illedan: I do some tracking, helps a lot
 Chitti_01: Guys I just have this doubt the default code they gave for taking input is incomplete right???
 tobk: in what way? guessing that there will probably be fewer pellets there, or for actually hunting pacs?
 kovi: i started tracking today. no difference yet
 eulerscheZahl: to avoid deaths? less useless paths for eaten pellets?
 njaber: I'm working on a full tracking rn, currently times out after ~30 turns of not seeing the enemy, when I add optimizations, it should go for much longer, then I'll start actually using the tracking for something XD
 eulerscheZahl: there's a discussion about giving dead pacmen in input
 Chitti_01: Guys I just have this doubt the default code they gave for taking input is incomplete right???
 wlesavo: i use opp positions in path estimation based on opp type eulerscheZahl 
 njaber: That'd be great
 jrke: can our pac see back also
 Illedan: ye
 Doju: njaber wow that's pretty neat
 Doju: maybe just add a limit that stops tracking once it's about to time out?
 james1729: How do people display text above their pacs?
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE id x y tet
 eulerscheZahl: text
 njaber: Yeah I'll probably do that, for now I'm still in testing mode
 james1729: Thanks
 Doju: also that's a pretty decent idea imo
 Doju: variable depth simulation
 shashwat986: eulerscheZahl where's this discussion happening? Is it possible there will be rule changes when Silver opens?
 eulerscheZahl: discord, private moderators channel&#160;:/
 shashwat986: Chitti_01the default input code should be complete&#160;:|
 Illedan: kovi -.-
 wlesavo: that addition would be grate
 wlesavo: just giving up all the pacs with visible flag would be the best, but to late for actually adding an input
 Doju: hmm, why don't i actually just slap everything that's not input() into a try: except: thing
 Doju: as a last ditch effort
 njaber: that's... technically an optimization of your win rate
 njaber: but it makes me wanna puke
 Doju: hahah
 Doju: why
 njaber: because indiscriminate catching is bad
 Doju: ermm
 Doju: but it's for sure better than just getting an error?
 njaber: In the specific case of optimizing your win rate, yes
 Doju: if i throw my error handling function to the except part then i still get the errors when i'm debugging
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/f4a16eb714c49393f84132d59b35220e0585921">https://www.codingame.com/profile/f4a16eb714c49393f84132d59b35220e0585921</a> interesting username
 njaber: Hey, wouldn't it be a cool start to camp in a corner where the enemy has few chance of seeing you/guessing you're here, and waiting for them to come to eat them
 Doju: that would be a cool strat indeed
 Uljahn: and than lose by points, ye great
 njaber: I doubt it's efficiency tho
 Illedan: Waste of pac move time
 njaber: cool&#160;!= winning
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid it could translate to 摴睙桬す䩱穏湚䭩

 fatrujilloa: .... I cannot copy and paste&#160;? 
 fatrujilloa: WTF
 MadKnight: fatrujilloa it just turned into a paste
 fatrujilloa: Is there anyone having problems with the 'visible_pellet_count'&#160;? 
 shashwat986: what sort of problems fatrujilloa?
 fatrujilloa: Sometimes my code gets stuck in the loop to read the input 
 shashwat986: that shouldn't happen
 cegprakash: can I eat my own pacman
 the_joker_100: lmao y do u want to?
 cegprakash: I don't want to.. but it can be sometimes useful to save 1 pacman
 cegprakash: when 2 are trapped
 the_joker_100: probably not man
 cegprakash: u eat one of ur own
 cegprakash: and escape
 the_joker_100: definitely not
 shashwat986: XD
 Astrobytes: Pacman wadas cegprakash&#160;:)
 the_joker_100: maybe tryt to improve ur food search such that it is very rare that 2 of ur own pacs meet
 cegprakash: go see wood2 bots and tell me how rare it is for 2 pacs to meet
 cegprakash: it's pretty common
 cegprakash: happens always
 the_joker_100: kk
 the_joker_100: idk then
 shashwat986: cegprakash in case you aren't joking, what I've done to reduce collisions is make sure two of my pacmen don't go after the same pellet. That greatly reduces collisions
 cegprakash: I don't go after pellets
 cegprakash: I only go to positions
 cegprakash: and score each position
 cegprakash: it's like a search
 anid: @shashwat986, this may reduce collisions but it will not eliminate them
 anid: say 2 pellets are in a line, the pacs will each try to move towards one and will continually bump against each other
 AntiSquid: anyone else experiencing a bug where they can't rank up to top 3&#160;?
 Aitorcius: do you save your pacs with a if(mine)... or the game makes it?
 anid: Me
 the_joker_100: yeah
 cegprakash: right.. shashwat986 what he means is if ur pacs have to cross each other to reach their pellet target u will still collide
 shashwat986: true
 cegprakash: but that may not happen if u go for closest pellet
 shashwat986: i actually have logic explicitly looking at collisions and moving my pacs to ensure they go in different directions
 cegprakash: but there is still a chance
 shashwat986: but just sending pacs to different pellets reduced my collisions to maybe 5% of what they were earlier
 anid: Another way would be to see if a collision happened in the previous turn so that it can be avoided later
 kovi: antisquad, illedan and me managed a workaround vs. that bug
 kovi: antisquid sorry
 cegprakash: anid that's bad it's better to predict the collision few turns ahead
 Aitorcius: if a do if(mine) to save the pacs the lenght will be 8, and if i do if(!mine) the lenght will be 4, you need to do this?
 cegprakash: choose diff paths
 cegprakash: but then I was serious about eating my own pacman
 cegprakash: but just confirmed with referee that I can't eat
 anid: Hmm, I dont use a BFS yet and this is enough for silver&#160;:)

 shashwat986: kovi is it a simple workaround XD
 the_joker_100: prob requires a lot of skills
 shashwat986: cegprakash it mentions in the instructions that you can't eat
 rogster001: what is the point of the 'shortest path' movement stuff? unless our pacs can see through walls or around corners then the pellets visible are always going to be in a straight line  orthogonally from the pacs position
 ltmoran: going to the super pellets?
 anid: @rogster001 super pellets
 rogster001: any pellets
 rogster001: unless ive misread
 ltmoran: uh no
 ltmoran: THe big ones worth 10 points
 shashwat986: Super-pellets are so bright that they can be seen from everywhere!
 rogster001: right 
 rogster001: ok i get you
 cegprakash: really? no line of sight for super pellets?
 anid: :D cegprakash
 shashwat986: nope. you see all existing superpellets
 shashwat986: always
 rogster001: i dont know - the perspective is not neccesarily the observers is it
 CRVII: Hello, if I create a map of the area and want to print it, how do I make sure its not seen as a answer?
 Scarfield: error print, whats your language?
 cegprakash: "You can only see pacs and pellets that are in the line of sight of your pacs"
 Aitorcius: how can i do the collisions? saving the last moves?
 CRVII: c
 Scarfield: WOW
 rogster001: right
 Scarfield: are you reading statement seg :o
 rogster001: so that was my point so why does it give you a movement which is the 'shortest path'?
 shashwat986: cegprakash if you go down to the "The Pacs" section
 shashwat986: "Your pacs cannot see through walls. On each turn you have vision on all of the pellets and enemy pacs that can be connected by a continuous straight line to any one of your pacs. Super-pellets are so bright that they can be seen from everywhere!"
 rogster001: ok il read more throughly thanks
 shashwat986: rogster001 because even if I can't see at point X, Y, I can still ask my pac to move there
 shashwat986: at which point the judge looks at the shortest way to get there, and uses that route
 rogster001: but i thought we were only given information about pellets in line of sight
 cegprakash: thx @shashwat986
 jke: does it give enemy cooldowns in the input?
 shashwat986: for visible enemy pacs, yes jke
 rogster001: originally i thought we would be evaluating by the amount of pellets in ANY area which place to head for
 Astrobytes: If they are visible yes
 shashwat986: rogster001 that's a good strategy, sure.
 rogster001: basic one of course but was just assumption about game inputs etc
 the_joker_100: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460329243">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460329243</a>
 the_joker_100: guys i think there is a bug?
 rogster001: so thats why the game inputs for single pac at least did not neccesarily seem to support that
 the_joker_100: it says i got no pacs even though i have 2 still alive
 shashwat986: where does it say you got no pacs?
 the_joker_100: in the game information
 Grrec: Why cant I play against the code of a friend? He is also Bronze, shouldnt I be able to find and add him? I can see @Eulersche ... but not my friend :D
 Lulemair: the_joker_100On my side it says you gave 2 instructions to your Pacman
 Astrobytes: It gives the wrong ID for dead pacs sometimes
 the_joker_100: Game Summary:Only Mazelcop still has pacs standing!Mazelcop wins with 215 pellets
 Astrobytes: in the timeline bar that it
 Astrobytes: *is
 shashwat986: Astrobytes I thought the input doesn't give dead pacs
 shashwat986: ah, ok
 Derthek: Grrecc, you only see top 1000
 Astrobytes: I think it uses the total pac count as id
 Astrobytes: rather than your team pac's id
 Grrec: @Astrobytes I was debugging 2 hours, to figure out that enemy IDs are same as mine. They collide and overwrite if you dont care about the "mine" value as well for separation.
 the_joker_100: is it a bug then?
 Lulemair: no&#160;?
 shashwat986: it's saying you gave invalid/no output in the last move
 Lulemair: You have 2 instructions to your pacman
 Lulemair: gave*
 Astrobytes: Grrec yeah I know they're the same. But the ID given in the timeline bar when one pac dies is wrong sometimes
 Grrec: @Astrobytes I was also tracking "dying" pacs out this was triggered everytime an enemy vision was lost.
 Grrec: Mhh ok thats strange
 the_joker_100: kkkk
 the_joker_100: oh damn
 Lulemair: On the replay it says you commanded Pac2 twice ^^
 jkristof94: Hello everyone! Does anyone know if the referee will be available for this game as well?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: e.g: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460330059">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460330059</a>
 Astrobytes: Look at the pac ID in the timeline when it crashes, and look at my pac ids
 shashwat986: It could be an indexing issue. 0-index vs 1-index&#160;?
 avdg: pac ids move up if one dies
 Lulemair: Astrobytes, the issue is about the destination I think, not his current position
 the_joker_100: i have no idea how that is happenin
 avdg: pac ids are not pac reserved
 tomatoes: jkristof <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020</a>
 shashwat986: avdg i don;'t think that's correct
 avdg: heard reports yesterday evening
 avdg: but my bot doesn't depend on id's
 jkristof94: Thanks tomatoes, exactly what I need!
 Astrobytes: Look, I get that pac id's are unique for each team
 avdg: it just sees pacs, gives them orders, so I don't have issues :P
 ltmoran: Anyone else having issues with the input of the pellets?
 ltmoran: i don't even know lol
 ltmoran: Whatever I do
 ltmoran: It doesn't run
 avdg: pellets and opponents are subjected to fog of war except at the starter levels
 avdg: you can always try to expand to unknown areas
 Astrobytes: What I am trying to say, is that the ID given when a pac dies or crashes in the timeline does not reflect the correct id of the pac. Eg. the pac id you get when you hover over it
 shashwat986: go back to the default code ltmoran 
 shashwat986: see if that takes input properly?
 avdg: pac ids are just a list of known pacs
 avdg: so no ids, just a list of pacs, that is what you get
 ltmoran: Yeah I'll try that
 ltmoran: bope
 ltmoran: nope
 ltmoran: still not working
 Astrobytes: If my pacs are numbered 0 and 1, and enemy pacs are 0 and 1, why the fk does "Pac 2 (red) cannot reach..." get output in the timeline?
 avdg: super pallets are always visible
 avdg: astrobytes, you had pac 2 before 1 died?
 Astrobytes: NO
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460330059">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460330059</a>
 Astrobytes: Sometimes you get pac 3, or pac 4
 avdg: for that replay, it seems your bot crosses edges
 Astrobytes: I think it's using the total pac count to ouput an ID when it should output the team-specific Pac ID
 avdg: please mind the wrap
 Astrobytes: YES AVDG, that is NOT THE POINT HERE
 Astrobytes: IT was to illustrate the ID timeline issue
 avdg: k, which turn?
 Astrobytes: Look for the red bar in the timeline, says Pac 2 blah blah...
 Astrobytes: Now hover over the Pacs and check the IDs
 avdg: hover the red item
 avdg: -1, 0 is unreachable
 cegprakash: it'll be better if we also get how many enemy pacs are alive
 Astrobytes: avdg THAT IS NOT THE POINT
 Astrobytes: I KNOW it crashes
 ltmoran: Would someone mind sharing their Python code which grabs the input? Mine doesn't seem to be working and I'm not sure how to reset it to the defaults
 Astrobytes: LOOK AT THE DAMN ID
 cegprakash: Id of what
 cegprakash: oh
 Astrobytes: Another example, gives me Pac ID of 4 - there is no Pac ID of 4<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460341476">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460341476</a>
 cegprakash: to avdg
 cegprakash: i thought fo rme
 avdg: not sure where to look at
 Astrobytes: No not you cegprakash
 avdg: I only see the wrap issue, not the id issue
 Scarfield: lol
 cegprakash: id avdg
 cegprakash: use pacman id
 cegprakash: not index
 Astrobytes: avdg Where it says Pac X cannot reach its target
 tomatoes: hover event on timeline
 Astrobytes: Then hover over the Pac IDs
 cegprakash: yeah hover on the pacman
 Astrobytes: The timeline event does not reflect a valid ID
 Scarfield: maybe that part of the error output is just numbered from 1, instead of from 0 for the ids?
 avdg: oh, that is just the error message...
 Scarfield: does it have any impact on the code
 avdg: for ai it's not a problem
 avdg: for humans it's confusing
 Astrobytes: It seems to reflect the index of the total pacman count rather than an id, therefore it's useless
 Astrobytes: OBVIOUSLY avdg, it's rather annoying when debugging
 avdg: if one looks at github, they might see a id + 1 I guess
 avdg: fixed with pr
 rogster001: is there any way of using more than one class  file in the IDE?
 avdg: I guess I crashed the world
 avdg: totally not language being a problem here &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
 Scarfield: only one file in the IDE
 rogster001: ok
 avdg: use a compiler, upload with cg local?
 avdg: depends on language and available tools I guess
 muy31: you can make different classes though in the IDE
 muy31: just no public
 muy31: *not public
 Scarfield: "Astrobytes 03:15PMWhat I am trying to say, is that the ID given when a pac dies or crashes in the timeline does not reflect the correct id of the pac. Eg. the pac id you get when you hover over it"
 Scarfield: i guess this is the same issue then?
 Scarfield: id + 1
 muy31: the pacId stays the same no matter what
 Scarfield: good&#160;:)
 dbdr: I started to play (and lose) against Illedan, that's a good sign&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Must be Scarfield, I don't see any PR?
 Scarfield: PR?
 Illedan: dbdr, as long as you keep losing&#160;;)
 dbdr: I'll wait for the recalc to start winning, Illedan&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: pull request Scarfield, av d g said there was a PR on Github
 Illedan: haha dbdr, never again
 dbdr: :D
 Scarfield: havent checked git myself, but i trust muy 31 has already been trough the issue, and knows from his statement&#160;:)
 avdg: hmm super pellets are referred in the source code as cherries
 Astrobytes: I never said anything about pac id's changing though? I'm talking about the timeline only. It's extremely annoying for debugging
 Illedan: changing?
 jrke: hey any suggestion my code time out
 ltmoran: Would anyone mind sharing their Python code that gets the input with me? Mine is broken and I don't know how to restore the original
 tomatoes: top right
 jrke: restore button is above like refresh button or you can get your last submitted code from history in bottom left
 avdg: Astrobytes: found the issue <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/754903f4a66fc4575ac988f7f15e7c85da0aa162/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Game.java#L374">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/754903f4a66fc4575ac988f7f15e7c85da0aa162/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Game.java#L374</a>
 Astrobytes: Illedan The ID given in the timeline is + 1 of the actual pac id e.g. when a pac dies or makes an invalid move
 Astrobytes: Fix it avdg :P
 avdg: no
 Astrobytes: :D
 avdg: no
 avdg: I better patch terser again
 Astrobytes: OK, that'll be a no then
 avdg: or fix compiling vs code on my machine
 Scarfield: oh it was avd g that said the pac ids were given as a list, got it mixed up
 avdg: actually, pacs have an id and a number
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/754903f4a66fc4575ac988f7f15e7c85da0aa162/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Pacman.java#L113-L119">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/754903f4a66fc4575ac988f7f15e7c85da0aa162/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Pacman.java#L113-L119</a>
 avdg: id is used internal, number is used when passing to the ai
 avdg: so the fix should be to return the number instead of the id
 avdg: (I guess id is unique for all pacs)
 avdg: ok I might fix this in github
 avdg: and send a pr
 Fosfen: Is it normal that a battle against a player has not the same outcome when I bring it to IDE&#160;? The code is the same because I just submitted it and waited a few minutes to watch battles
 Kukiss: Remember that the opponent might be using some kind of randomness for his moves.
 avdg: fix is ready for merge
 avdg: kukiss: or lack of randomness due to cooldown
 Astrobytes: avdg:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/d71009713f346163031ad2ad99198a0ef60f56a3/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CommandManager.java#L115-L123">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/d71009713f346163031ad2ad99198a0ef60f56a3/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CommandManager.java#L115-L123</a>

 avdg: astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/pull/3">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/pull/3</a>
 avdg: getNumber is already used
 avdg: but for that one case, getId was used
 Fosfen: @Kukiss @avdg Indeed, even in the IDE each run isn't the same thank you&#160;!
 rogster001: against a test bot? or your opponent?
 avdg: my bot uses random numbers
 avdg: but I changed that to a seeded one
 rogster001: i doubt the IDE import knows about any seed used so you jsut have to deal with the randomness in dev 
 Astrobytes: nice one avdg
 rogster001: i mean seed used in the game you played live
 avdg: for js/ts is let seed = 1234567890;const rand = () =&gt; ((seed = (seed * 16807)&#160;% 2147483647) - 1) / 2147483646;
 rogster001: yes but you cant account for opponent seeding
 avdg: well, you have to help your opponent with that&#160;:-)
 avdg: increases 1% chance debugability :p
 rogster001: yer its just about narrowing it down for that use case
 avdg: well, its still handy for testing
 rogster001: yes i agree - at least you can force your bot to do a more predictable sequence
 avdg: and still be unpredictable at first glance&#160;;-)
 avdg: well, it's not cryptographically strong
 avdg: far from it
 rogster001: i dont think we have to worry about that..
 rogster001: are there any prizes in this competition or is it just the glory?
 avdg: should be on the banner page
 rogster001: ok ta
 njaber: there's a Computer screen for First place I think
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 rogster001: flippin hell i could do with one - sold out everywhere!
 avdg: too many contestants
 rogster001: unless you want one that cooks you dinner too
 rogster001: thanks for the link - good prizes there, fun
 ltmoran: I wouldn't get too enthusiastic lol
 ltmoran: The top people seem to have it under lock and key
 avdg: I'm quite confident I won't get top 10 even if I try my best :p
 jrke: hey everyone is trying their best
 muy31: i cannot believe this... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460094795">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460094795</a>
 Astrobytes: All about the fun tho'&#160;;)
 muy31: guess ill have to fix my bug
 muy31: Can I be the bronze or silver bot?
 BenjaminUrquhart: anything is possible
 avdg: muy31 mine does less like that even though my bot has some logics to prevent that
 avdg: especially blind corners are making this game hard
 muy31: yeah
 avdg: if we replaced them with traffic and cars, we would be under lockdown for other reasons :p
 muy31: :grin:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Fosfen: I just reached top ~700&#160;!! That's not that big but I'm happy with it :D 
 shashwat986: It's big Fosfen, congrats!
 avdg: welcome&#160;:-
 avdg: )
 avdg: so tomorrow we have silver club?
 shashwat986: how many hours from now?
 avdg: probably same time as contest opening
 Scarfield: 26h ifaik
 Astrobytes: around 26 hours
 RockyMullet: gj Fosfen
 njaber: It's not in 18h?
 RockyMullet: contest usually starts the friday, I dont remember a contest starting on thursday
 muy31: has anyone successfully implemented enemy location prediction yet?
 Astrobytes: Think it was cause of VE day holiday RockyMullet
 muy31: or are we all waiting till silver
 njaber: I'm almost done
 avdg: I have some logics, but my ai doesn't use it to its full potential yet
 Scarfield: nope, thinking about how to do it, and how to use it though
 njaber: And my AI doesn't use it at all yet
 RockyMullet: oh thats a holiday in europe
 RockyMullet: ok
 Astrobytes: Yea
 ltmoran: Are there always 4 superPellets?
 avdg: it timed out my both yesterday evening because of having it
 muy31: i see
 avdg: though pathfinding was another cause
 Scarfield: thats is hopefully not its full potential :p
 eulerscheZahl: no holiday in Germany. But it is in France
 avdg: but I get it fixed with few optimizations
 muy31: so far, i haven't even recognized the fact that enemy pacs exist
 njaber: Pthfinding is very light for me, 13ms at the start then almost instant during turns
 muy31: that will probably be my next move
 avdg: I don't measure
 avdg: unless watching timeouts is a measurement as well
 muy31: i do all pathfinds at the beginning
 avdg: mine doesn't
 avdg: situation changes too much
 avdg: or I don't see a non-changing situation
 RockyMullet: yeah all pathfinding from all cells to all cells at on first frame
 avdg: you must have a special struct :p
 avdg: or graph
 RockyMullet: a distance and a direction to move
 avdg: but in the latter, you still have to pathfind, albeit, less expensive unless you need to check tiles as well
 Scarfield: is it really helpful in this contest though? if there is a pac in the shortest path between 2 cells, it will not be correct anyway?
 avdg: rockymullet: works great on spirals&#160;;-)
 njaber: But pacs move
 RockyMullet: I dont see the problem
 Scarfield: collisions?
 njaber: Pacs aren't obstacles, the real problem is not trailing a pac becaus in that case he would take all the pellets and leave you none
 RockyMullet: oh I meant the spirals
 njaber: Just eat pacs or something
 avdg: s/aren't/not always
 RockyMullet: but the precomputed paths can after be use to make a current path
 RockyMullet: since tehre are multiple possible paths toward a position
 njaber: No pacs aare not obstacles, you either flee them, try to optimize to take more pellet then them, or eat them
 njaber: Considering them as obstacles is useless
 Scarfield: sure, im just thinking it might not be that helpful in this contest?
 avdg: I see too many bouncing pacs :p
 RockyMullet: but there are still way l;ess possible paths when you at least all the possbiel paths to go there
 avdg: but more often from blind corners
 RockyMullet: well since you dont see the enemies most of the time
 RockyMullet: to know shortest path without collision to a point is still really usefull
 njaber: Yeah because people don't care about pacs at all, but counting pacs as obstacles won't make your bot better, if pacs bounce you are also keeping an enemy pac occupied
 RockyMullet: this ^
 avdg: pacs that are spread catch more pellets
 avdg: in many cases
 njaber: Oh you're talking abotu your own pacs
 RockyMullet: my latyest change taht had a great positive impact, was to just ignore enemy collision and keep bumping into them
 njaber: then just make pacs go towards pellets which are closer to them then they are to any other ally pac
 njaber: and that's where the pathfinding is useful
 RockyMullet: on the other hand, pathfinding helped me to not bump into my own pacs
 avdg: seems your sinks are not great
 RockyMullet: sinks&#160;?
 avdg: ideally, pacs move away from each other, or move in the same direction
 avdg: unless you lock an opponent
 avdg: sinks -&gt; destination
 njaber: I haven't update my code in almost 30 hours, of course it still has tons of problems
 avdg: (gravitational version of destination, in context of target being lower of points than other results)
 RockyMullet: rn the only thing I do to avoid collision, is that I "resever" the position of my first movement toward the pathfinding, so my others pacs check tehre first move too and wont go there is anohther pac is already there
 RockyMullet: reserve*
 RockyMullet: damn I cant write
 avdg: reservation should be rarely needed
 ZarthaxX: how do you know these?
 ZarthaxX: i mean have you tested it
 avdg: only known case if pacs have to cross when coming from different directions (and collide on a junction)
 RockyMullet: around 73:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460377125">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460377125</a>
 RockyMullet: my pac let my other pac pass instead of bumping
 avdg: left pac getting right pellet and right pac getting left pellet is stupid
 ZarthaxX: what a humble pac
 RockyMullet: to be honest, my gathering suck and they shouldnt be both in that corner
 RockyMullet: but at least it works haha
 ZarthaxX: carne u made good pacs
 ZarthaxX: they are gonna be great fathers some day
 Astrobytes: The PacDaddy
 ZarthaxX: sounds weird
 eulerscheZahl: make pacman great again
 RockyMullet: they dont eat enough pellets to give birth
 avdg: lol opponent chases dead
 Astrobytes: The PacFather
 eulerscheZahl: The PacCifier
 Astrobytes: oh dear :D
 RockyMullet: first game of my submit against you euler
 RockyMullet: and I LOST
 Scarfield: maybe i should make my pacs humble: thinking:
 RockyMullet: life's not fair
 avdg: who won on first try?
 eulerscheZahl: at least you tried RockyMullet
 eulerscheZahl: i was wondering what you are doing in my last battles
 RockyMullet: I actually stole something from your bot because I lost another match earlier lol
 RockyMullet: I used to switch when stock on a collision with same type of pac
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 RockyMullet: but a lot of better bot (like yours) would jsut reswitch and kill me
 RockyMullet: so I stole that hehe
 eulerscheZahl: for a long time our last match was on par. but then you failed to find more pellets
 RockyMullet: yup
 RockyMullet: my gathering is by far the worst part of my bot
 RockyMullet: it is mostly "go to nearest that another friendly pac isnt already going to"
 RockyMullet: so yeah, it sucks
 RockyMullet: it is also the first part I did, quickly on thursday lunch break, so it is already horrible ugly code lol
 eulerscheZahl: i slowly start to dislike my codebase too
 eulerscheZahl: and i found a bug in the MonoDevelop debugger&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: ¡?????
 ZarthaxX: what is it
 eulerscheZahl: running the code, printing error statements =&gt; i get the output that i expect
 RockyMullet: why not VS community&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: setting a breakpoint before that, inspecting the var: shows something else
 eulerscheZahl: and then prints something else when i continue
 eulerscheZahl: because VS community isn't for Linux
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 RockyMullet: ooooh
 RockyMullet: ok
 ZarthaxX: impossible to debug&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, debugging the code sucks with that&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: weird that no one found that one
 ZarthaxX: hits a core part
 eulerscheZahl: and i can perfectly reproduce it
 ZarthaxX: even worst
 RockyMullet: ok this submit got me 44th, looks good, I made a small improvement to my gathering, not sure if I was lucky or it was actually better
 RockyMullet: hard to tell with a 2.6k people league hehe
 ZarthaxX: still spaghetti carne?
 eulerscheZahl: i dumped my random search
 AntiSquid: new number 1
 eulerscheZahl: failed to find the big pellet too often
 RockyMullet: yes, with stuff that doesnt belong on spaghethi, like chocolate and coffee
 ZarthaxX: not longer doing random search?
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but still a search
 ZarthaxX: the toad dropping his preference
 RockyMullet: yeah thats something I must change on my pacs, they are too tursty for big pellets
 ZarthaxX: RockyMullet LOL
 RockyMullet: even tho way too far to hope to get it before the enemy
 ZarthaxX: chocooooooooolate
 ZarthaxX: well "before the enemy" implies u somehow know where he is
 ZarthaxX: tho initial positions tell you what to discard
 RockyMullet: yeah my plan was to just "forget" about those big pellets
 RockyMullet: if the closest is the enemy
 RockyMullet: but it might make it worst against bad bots
 ZarthaxX: u can try
 RockyMullet: so I'll probably wait for silver to do that
 ZarthaxX: just takes 1 submit to discard
 ZarthaxX: yeah, the problem rn is matches count on submit
 ZarthaxX: we need moar
 eulerscheZahl: silver will be huge
 eulerscheZahl: killing the website
 avdg: my code is less than 800 lines and has lots of comments
 ZarthaxX: half bronze or 1/3?
 avdg: way smaller than other contests...
 RockyMullet: yeah but I'm pretty sure most people go straight for big pellets at start
 ZarthaxX: anyway ppl will get through easily
 RockyMullet: just really bad bot that wont
 ZarthaxX: RockyMullet like mine
 RockyMullet: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 RockyMullet: carne&#160;!
 RockyMullet: what are you doing
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: didnt tell my bot to go for big pellet
 ZarthaxX: he may go ocassionally
 RockyMullet: its 10 points&#160;!
 ZarthaxX: i got better things to do!
 ZarthaxX: it may find that it's good to go for it
 avdg: 🐛
 ZarthaxX: gotta change some stuff so it goes more often carne
 ZarthaxX: will do, promise
 RockyMullet: put a bit of paprika on that spaggethi
 eulerscheZahl: my code has a bit over 800 lines and has visual comments <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/t6imroM">https://imgur.com/a/t6imroM</a>
 ZarthaxX: uhuhuh 
 eulerscheZahl: (removed parts of it)
 ZarthaxX: love paprika, spread it everywhere
 RockyMullet: nice
 thibpat: Hi :wave: I'm streaming my progress on the Spring Challenge on Twitch <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 ZarthaxX: cool :O
 RockyMullet: hey thibault
 ZarthaxX: dont get that eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: get what?
 ZarthaxX: that imgur
 eulerscheZahl: is it blocked on your side?
 Astrobytes: more pretty animations euler&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: nono
 ZarthaxX: i just didnt get the "OR"
 eulerscheZahl: 0 (=id) R (=rock)
 ZarthaxX: ah ah
 ZarthaxX: but what does this have to do with your visual comments?
 eulerscheZahl: helped me to spot a bug. was resetting all pellets on cells visible to me or the opponent :D
 ZarthaxX: hahaa
 eulerscheZahl: as a reply to "my code is less than 800 lines and has lots of comments"
 ZarthaxX: i found something related to that, i wasnt removing super pellets that had been eaten already
 eulerscheZahl: not really a comment
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: u use pijijs for the animations?
 ZarthaxX: pixi
 eulerscheZahl: no, i draw images with C# and for the sharing i generated a gif with imagemagick
 eulerscheZahl: and thanks to the language update i have to use my own
 eulerscheZahl: because .net core doesn't support the bitmap drawing
 the_joker_100: just re wrote the whole thing
 eulerscheZahl: so it would crash on CG
 the_joker_100: fingers crossed
 ZarthaxX: oh.. okey
 ZarthaxX: that's super cool!
 ZarthaxX: is there a lib for making gifs?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8400a9c0-1501-4f3c-9e47-21f3ba838b60">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8400a9c0-1501-4f3c-9e47-21f3ba838b60</a>
 ZarthaxX: imagemagick i mean
 eulerscheZahl: that's all the code i need for the imagesand then from the command line:convert *.png replay.gif
 ZarthaxX: so cool
 ZarthaxX: makes it super easy
 eulerscheZahl: i could set a delay per frame and such as well
 eulerscheZahl: imagemagick is great. i even recolored the cars for the 2nd part of my space maze game in the terminal
 ZarthaxX: so cool :O
 AntiSquid: so cool to lose vs the frame limit -.-
 AntiSquid: well my pacs are flawed but still
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/2DignAd">https://imgur.com/a/2DignAd</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it's not even 200 turns as written in the statement
 eulerscheZahl: it's 200 frames, which is less when speeding
 avdg: so better write a bot that speeds up when winning?
 njaber: That's not dumb
 njaber: The best thing would be to speed when the enemy isn't
 Doju: sorry whaat?
 Doju: i'm printing commands but they're not doing anything
 avdg: errors?
 Doju: No errors
 avdg: also mind all commands have to be written on 1 line
 avdg: separated by |
 Doju: Oh nevermind im just screwing the pellets up again
 AntiSquid: what is best way to keep track of total frames&#160;? lol
 avdg: not sure, opponent might be speeding while you are not
 AntiSquid: exactly the issue
 avdg: and 2 pacs is enough to speed continuously 
 avdg: so best strat if frame counting is winning goal:
 avdg: always have a pac speeding and always keep 2 alive
 Quidome: hm, this is interesting, glad I was watching the chat&#160;:)
 Quidome: So you only can know the exact ending of the match if you have at least 1 speeding bot all the time
 avdg: other ai might die, or one ai might already have hit an unbeaten situation
 avdg: so still not 100% there yet
 eulerscheZahl: too early in the contest, probably not even legend level yet
 avdg: s/legend/silver/
 avdg: click the league above to see status
 kovi: will game length be "fixed" for silver?
 avdg: better track github
 Doju: Will the submit stop if i don't watch it all the way?
 Doju: or like wait for it to finish
 avdg: it's a job that doesn't change once submitted
 AntiSquid: you can submit today and check the result when contest is finished you want to doju
 VSLourenco: What "Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move"  means?
 shashwat986: Quidome &lt;3 I love your profile pic

 Hjax: huh, thats interesting 
 iFightLegends: looks like paper doesn't beat rock after all xD
 iFightLegends: Even two papers together can't make it&#160;;)
 Hjax: its because you are colliding with his paper at the same time 
 ZarthaxX: the f is that
 iFightLegends: But look here, when I try with scissors I die:

 eulerscheZahl: funny replay
 Hjax: i guess you cant break that then? 
 njaber: If you are winning you could block access to remaining pellets to the enemy for trolling purposes :thonk:
 ZarthaxX: well he lost time with those 2 there so better to leave
 iFightLegends: I just don't know how I can make my code understand what's happening there :D
 avdg: learn unit testing :p
 ZarthaxX: just forget it lol

 eulerscheZahl: but i got my revenge and evaded their site recently
 eulerscheZahl: invaded
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: hey is visible_pac_count pac visible to pac or pac on screen?
 avdg: still got 2 timeouts&#160;:/
 NapTown: your pacs + enemies in sight of one of your pacs
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: Hmm, then it would be hard to make my pac practice social distancing 
 avdg: I guess you want to infect your opponent :p
 Doju: Exception: BUG
 Doju: that's helpful, gj me
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: na avoid infection in my own kind
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: infecting other pac is better idea
 shashwat986: Do you guys also have some games where it says I lost because of timeout, but when I copy the game to IDE, it works fine there
 avdg: can be normal
 avdg: ai may act different, but hardware may also be different or in a different state
 avdg: most hardware these days are temperature throttled, but that is only 1 factor and weird for servers to have
 avdg: or the hardware was affected by external interruptions
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: if I may ask what is the role of hardware in AI? I mean logics are carried out even if machine throttled, If such things happen software would break down when machine throttle.
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: sorry is I sound stupid but I want to know reasoning
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: *if
 Zenoscave: WaRiOrOfCoDe the reason is there are different specs on the hardware typically. If you timeout in league but not ide it means your code is hitting the 50ms
 Zenoscave: but only barely
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: oh that means constraints are given according to servers configuration

 the_joker_100: stopping each other game
 Doju: oooh
 the_joker_100: i rewrote the whole thing again
 the_joker_100: and this is just food search
 Doju: since pacs can't see while speeding... maybe they're marking unseen cells as empty for some reason
 Doju: wait no that can't be...
 the_joker_100: i sometimes think that speed just too unreliable right?
 Doju: that hypothesis of mine is luckily easy to test
 CowZow: Is there a way to figure out which turns are ones where only sped up Pacs can move?
 Doju: check where the distance to is 2?
 the_joker_100: but the direction matters too right?
 Doju: does it?
 Doju: actually i'm not sure about that
 Doju: maybe some experiments are in order
 the_joker_100: weel if they moving away from each other then its no problem?
 the_joker_100: well*
 Aitorcius: for collisions do you use a thread or not?
 Doju: I just can't find this damn vision bug
 Doju: i think threading won't do anything Aitorcius
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: does speed block vision
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: did you check?
 the_joker_100: yeah it just goes to where it went last time
 Doju: I tried checking it but the bug is not caused by speed
 Doju: so i'm not sure
 Aitorcius: if the pacs are blocking for 0.5sec change the direction, but i think maybe i need to do a thread
 Zenoscave: Aitorcius the machines you run on are non-hyperthreaded single cpus
 Aitorcius: oh ok
 Zenoscave: threading is pointless typically
 shashwat986: also, this is a turn-by-turn game
 Zenoscave: ^ this
 Aitorcius: soooo, the easiest way to do the collisions are last moves?
 Doju: It'd be really handy to output some kind of vision visuals from this
 Doju: but i have absolutely no idea how to do that
 Doju: or at least print something out without causing an exception
 Doju: it's absolutely impossible to debug anything
 Zenoscave: Aitorcius are you doing a simulation why do you need to handle collisions?
 shashwat986: oh! no wonder you're facing so much of a problem debugging
 shashwat986: I literally print the entire map every turn
 Doju: how do you do that?
 shashwat986: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8f8de72-fc3a-4b21-858f-587a846f9017">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8f8de72-fc3a-4b21-858f-587a846f9017</a>
 Doju: like, how do you print anything without the game freaking out
 shashwat986: I compute it, and display it
 shashwat986: oh, you need to print to STDERR
 Zenoscave: You have to print to stderr
 shashwat986: what language are you using?
 Aitorcius: Zenoscave, because if a can avoid the collisions i can get in bronze
 Doju: python
 Zenoscave: Not necessary. No one avoids collisions in bronze that way.
 Zenoscave: just do Breadth first search and stop if you would collide.
 Zenoscave: don't calculate colliision reactions though
 Zenoscave: print(..., file=sys.stderr)
 shashwat986: print("text", file=sys.stderr)
 Aitorcius: c# xd
 Doju: ooh thanks shashwat986
 Doju: i'll do that
 Zenoscave: Doju just make sure sys is imported
 Doju: i'll do that
 shashwat986: ^
 Doju: but im gonna go to the sauna, brb
 shashwat986: Aitorcius I got into bronze by just eating literally everything i could, and running away from all pacs
 Aitorcius: literally my mind blow and idk how to do xd
 Aitorcius: i proof with methods for making random points when they are colliding but doesnt work
 the_joker_100: rn im just searching for the best location to find food and going there
 the_joker_100: and im at 1028
 Aitorcius: you are doing your own map?
 the_joker_100: kind Of
 the_joker_100: yeah
 badboy7: hi
 AlluringChair: i got into bronze literally by selecting a random pellet and going there
 Rabeeb: doing your own map means?
 the_joker_100: i keep track of my locations basically
 IAmNoob: hi!
 the_joker_100: and where i have been there cnt be food there
 the_joker_100: cant*
 Aitorcius: well idk maybe i will delete all code and strat again because it is a kaos
 the_joker_100: im doin that rn
 the_joker_100: it feels so gooooood
 the_joker_100: after u start to see improvement sman
 Rabeeb: haha, u can improve more
 the_joker_100: yeah i dont even have anything for combat and stuffs
 Aitorcius: maybe i can code a method that finds the closest pellet for every pac
 Rabeeb: @Aitorcius I kind of did that too
 Zenoscave: Aitorcius that's called BFS
 Rabeeb: I had code for one pac
 Zenoscave: like I said earlier
 Rabeeb: then all were going the same way lol
 the_joker_100: maybe do a search where u can find the most pellets .i.e up, down ,left,right search and where the most pellet is go there
 wlesavo: no collusion
 Aitorcius: only one pac?
 Rabeeb: it took a lot to change that
 avdg: k, expanded my perf optimization a bit further, lets see what it does
 Rabeeb: yeah, the wood league code
 Aitorcius: copy paste the code for everyone and that is jajaj
 Aitorcius: ou top 2 wood league perfect but not, i have the worst code ever xd
 Aitorcius: yei bronze
 ZarthaxX: gz
 the_joker_100: k 
 the_joker_100: final submission for today
 the_joker_100: they cant collide no more
 Aitorcius: what a lucky hehe:cry:
 the_joker_100: if u just reached bronze u should probably re write everything
 BenjaminUrquhart: not necessarily 
 the_joker_100: well he asaid its chaos

 Icebox: vision loops arround map as well, right?
 the_joker_100: prob not?
 the_joker_100: i dont know man

 IAmNoob: why you speak so?
 IAmNoob: wlesavo
 the_joker_100: they can see through the loops?damn need to revise something then
 shashwat986: yes
 the_joker_100: but not today

 the_joker_100: yep
 Aitorcius: what time is it?
 the_joker_100: 10 54

 Cappefra: does the ranking take into account crashes and like point difference or is it only just about win/
 Aitorcius: three hours
 Cappefra: win/lose?
 IAmNoob: win/lose
 Cappefra: I mean is losing 118-120 as bad as 20-130?
 Uljahn: ye
 Cappefra: ouch
 Aitorcius: lose is bad and win good that is ahah
 Uljahn: score difference doesn't matter
 IAmNoob: yeah
 Cappefra: it's a shame though
 IAmNoob: all or nothing
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: it does not matter try for draw
 IAmNoob: draw dont matters too
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i have done draw
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: it is hard
 IAmNoob: it will rematch
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: to keep same score
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: no it did't happen
 IAmNoob: it dont shows
 AntiSquid: no there is no rematch for draw
 Cappefra: it wouldn't matter much on like thousands of games, but having it like this on this kind of challenge means submitting twice the same code can make a huuuuge difference
 Uljahn: sure
 Doju: Okay time to print stuff
 Doju: so glad i found out that you can actually do that
 Doju: thanks for letting me know
 AntiSquid: do what
 Doju: actually print something in a way that it doesn't freak the game out 
 Doju: that doesnt*
 Cappefra: I'm always so tense when I submit and I see my ranking float like crazy haha
 cegprakash: ur rank floats?
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Cappefra: lol
 cegprakash: mine sinks
 shashwat986: a LOT
 shashwat986: oh lol
 Cappefra: I submitted at 480 and I saw 950-&gt; 430 -&gt; 630 -&gt; 540
 Cappefra: now let's see what happens
 AntiSquid: i just submit and expect a random weird result that will force me to resubmit few times before i  get an idea of how good the bot is
 cegprakash: spammer AntiSquid
 Aitorcius: i have a question, the decrement cooldown timers and all these stuff, i need to manage them?
 AntiSquid: they reduced game count too much
 cegprakash: Aitorcius not necessarily u can use the input
 cegprakash: but u need it if u want to predict the future
 AntiSquid: 70 games and 2.7k in arena, yea sure accuracy will be flawless on first try tright?
 Cappefra: by game count you mean the number of battles to calculate your rank?
 Cappefra: yeah ok
 AntiSquid: Aitorcius you wrote atrocious wrong 
 shashwat986: Are there any youtube codingamers who work with c++ and stream?
 AntiSquid: yes Cappefra
 Cappefra: I'm so looking forward to the other leagues opening up
 cegprakash: lol AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: my submit ends at around 70 games
 cegprakash: he is not atrocious
 Aitorcius: any stream of c#?
 shashwat986: AntiSquid any video?
 shashwat986: *link
 AntiSquid: of what shashwat986&#160;?
 Aitorcius: Aitorcius xd
 AntiSquid: videos of what&#160;?
 shashwat986: oh, crap
 cegprakash: shashwat986 I streamed on first day of contest
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 shashwat986: i thought you replied to my comment with the name of a youtuber
 AntiSquid: no

 shashwat986: but you in fact said yes to Cappefra 
 Aitorcius: where is the list of streamers?
 shashwat986: thanks cegprakash
 Cappefra: fuck I lost ranks
 AntiSquid: expected
 Cappefra: I made some changes that I was hopeful about
 AntiSquid: ah
 AntiSquid: how many ranks did you lose?
 Cappefra: like 40
 Cappefra: I'm resubmitting
 AntiSquid: that's nothing
 AntiSquid: so basically your change doesn't do anything maybe 
 AntiSquid: or too few games to tell&#160;?
 Cappefra: yeah and I hoped to gain like 150
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: once I lost 1000 rank when I submitted
 AntiSquid: i timed out few submits ago and lost all 
 AntiSquid: won't matter, 7 days to go
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: mine were not practicing social distancing
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: and end up losing
 whadk: i have the same problem
 whadk: they all just stick together
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: just like girls
 AntiSquid: birds of a feather flock together
 shashwat986: -.- WaRiOrOfCoDe 
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: you know you gotta separate the one from group
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: to gain more points
 AntiSquid: oh ya the cuckoos doesn't belong with the rest
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yup
 shashwat986: do you guys use version control?
 JBM: not wisely
 BenjaminUrquhart: put everything in master
 BenjaminUrquhart: my version control is submit history :P
 shashwat986: XD 
 AntiSquid: local version control, but the rustic way, copy to file
 shashwat986: I'm thinking of rewriting a major component of my code :D wanted to be sure things don't break, so I'm considering it
 JBM: well it can't hurt
 JBM: but, you know, dumping the files in another folder is "one form" of version control too
 Kellthazar: Howdy, folks.&#160;:)
 rcar: spending 20 minutes learning git will give you a cleaner and easier type of version control than a bunch of copied folders
 rcar: it's worth the investment
 Kellthazar: #rcar is correct, you can save versions and switch from one to another easily.&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: Now I'm refactoring my pre calc algo.
 Jesus_inn_party: sup everybodeeeeee!
 Doju: sup Jesus
 Legitimacy: So I go up a league every time I defeat the boss?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yup
 Legitimacy: Does it usually take a while to move you up a league after defeating the boss?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: it happend with me so maybe yeah
 Legitimacy: Thankyou
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: np
 rcar: you need to submit your code and wait for it to play out all the matches
 Legitimacy: against everyone in my league?
 rcar: not everyone, but it plays a bunch of matches to make sure it has a good sense of your rank
 RoboStac: yeah, it's not about beating the boss in a single game but ending up ranked higher than the boss at the end of your submit
 Legitimacy: and now I'm wood 1 :sunglasses:
 Kellthazar: Gratz
 Legitimacy: oh god theres 5
 AntiSquid: for all those that posted wins vs me in chat, this is how you do it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460552314">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460552314</a> you post wins vs a top bot, not a low ranked one 
 Legitimacy: this is a pacatastrophe

 BenjaminUrquhart: we might get 2k in bronze by tomorrow
 BenjaminUrquhart: k here time to join the battle squid gang
 Quidome: you mean 3k?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah that one
 AntiSquid: you just did it again, i am relatively low ranked WaRiOrOfCoDe
 AntiSquid: btw it's warrior with 2 R
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: man how did you teach them to trap?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: my rank is way lower than yours
 Quidome: 3,5k submits, wow
 AntiSquid: there are 2700 in bronze already Benjonion
 AntiSquid: BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: I got corrected already
 AntiSquid: no that guy is also wrong
 shashwat986: Is there any way to increase the height of the console output?
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 is right
 Automaton2000: what if there is any way to get the id of the site is down
 BenjaminUrquhart: click the square
 BenjaminUrquhart: but then it covers the replay window
 shashwat986: yeah&#160;:)
 shashwat986:&#160;:(

 eulerscheZahl: but somehow still really close in points despite my lead by pacmen
 struct: One question when pac has speed it seems it uses 2 turns instead of 2 frames
 struct: is this right?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: he destroyed me at starting tries
 Illedan: struct, it uses 2 frames
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: shortens the game, magus reported it on the first evening already
 struct: so 2 frames + 2 turns?

 RockyMullet: oh nice
 shashwat986: what issue are you facing, AyeshaMansoor
 cegprakash: hey if my 2 scissors and opponent's 2 papers try to enter into same cell in a turn, does both papers die or everything blocked?
 shashwat986: everything blocked
 shashwat986: (probably)
 RockyMullet: ok after a couple of replay I got the same bug
 cegprakash: makes sense
 AyeshaMansoor: i don't knw how to code of this game
 cegprakash: AyeshaMansoor what league are u in
 jrke: which league
 cegprakash: if u are in wood2 just print the last visible pac
 cegprakash: that should take u to wood1
 icecream17: 500th to 920th? awww
 shashwat986: she's trying to solve a different problem altogether XD
 eulerscheZahl: what does not make sense: p1 ROCK moves on p1 PAPER while p2 PAPER moves on p1 ROCK
 jrke: hey last visible pellet not last visible pac
 shashwat986: brackets-extreme-edition
 eulerscheZahl: the rock moving on the own paper gets cancelled
 eulerscheZahl: but p2 can't eat the rock
 Illedan: huh?

 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/73d888b9-d0df-4837-ba67-adc37f1eddab">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/73d888b9-d0df-4837-ba67-adc37f1eddab</a>
 MadKnight: here's some code
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460424599">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460424599</a>
 Schneewittchen: What if paper, rock and scissor crosses?
 Schneewittchen: Game collapses?
 cegprakash: turn eulerscheZahl?
 MadKnight: no Illedan u're supposed to give hime new Code()
 Braykin08: If more than 2 pac crosses, noone moves
 Illedan: That makes sense eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: almost every turn cegprakash
 eulerscheZahl: 48
 Illedan: I see no problem on that one
 AntiSquid: AyeshaMansoor there's a bunch of links on discord with streamers coding bots for codingame, watch those 
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't make sense to me but ok..
 eulerscheZahl: i would expect the red paper to eat the blue rock
 cegprakash: why it makes sense
 Braykin08: Since the papers do not move into the tile with the rock, they do not kill it. They get blocked by each otehr first
 eulerscheZahl: at least before there are 2 papers
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3fb5539-345d-4546-b4f3-467fc3711b90">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3fb5539-345d-4546-b4f3-467fc3711b90</a>
 eulerscheZahl: at first there's only 1 red paper
 eulerscheZahl: at 48 there is no allied collision
 Adnmaster: guys i have a  problem where the pacs move slowly, can someone help me?
 AyeshaMansoor: discord mean
 Jay_Jayjay: what league are you in?
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl what happens when my paper moves right and opponent rock moves left do they cross each other
 Adnmaster: wood 1
 Jay_Jayjay: what language?
 eulerscheZahl: why do you think that i know these edge cases?
 Adnmaster: python3
 eulerscheZahl: i don't
 Jay_Jayjay: how many inputs do you have?
 cegprakash: coz u rank top 5
 Jay_Jayjay: and how many prints?
 Waffle3z: managed to climb from 100+ to 26th when I haven't submitted in 13 hours
 AntiSquid: hey euler i've update my bot a little bit
 shashwat986: heyy Waffle3z
 eulerscheZahl: that means nothing. i avoid collisions with my own units
 Adnmaster: i have a lot of calculations but not many inputs
 avdg: nice waffle
 eulerscheZahl: thanks AntiSquid
 Jay_Jayjay: you should have 5 inputs
 Jay_Jayjay: and one output
 eulerscheZahl: believe it or not the chat isn't even the worst
 Jay_Jayjay: every game loop
 shashwat986: I'm generally debugging against your bot, because your bot is incredibly passive, and great at pathing
 AntiSquid: you get private messages eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 Adnmaster: i have more inputs than 5
 eulerscheZahl: got a private message with someone asking to review his bot, full code as pastbin attached
 AntiSquid: happened to me too
 AntiSquid: he asked to help with c#
 Waffle3z: my bot? yeah I don't do much combat stuff, I think if I get in a stalemate I'll switch after speed runs out but that's it
 eulerscheZahl: you have a CG logo behind your nick
 Icebox: you obviously reviewed his bot eulerscheZahl didn't you?
 Icebox: like a nice guy that you are
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even open the link
 Icebox: xD
 MadKnight: hey cegprakash how's your bot&#160;?
 MadKnight: did u rekt AntiSquid&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: told him that it's a contest
 AntiSquid: i directed the guy to euler btw
 Icebox: I mean I had something similar but worse
 shashwat986: :D
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm curious who it is...
 Icebox: Some dude asked me to review his art and sent me furry hentai :upside_down:
 Icebox: so yeah, idk
 Icebox: Id rather get a pastebin of code tbh
 eulerscheZahl: asked via PM, we are talking about the same user
 MadKnight: did u like it Icebox&#160;?
 Icebox: MadKnight I can forward him to you if you're interested
 AntiSquid: madk your rank is 10 times bigger than mine
 Quidome: dbdr you there?
 AntiSquid: madao kun fix it
 eulerscheZahl: MK submitted? :o
 MadKnight: your rank is 10 times smaller than mine AntiSquid fix it
 anid: Is the ability cooldown for all pacs or is it for a single pac
 AntiSquid: should i crash submit or what
 AntiSquid: playing dirty mk, you ask ceg to fight your battles
 dbdr: Quidome: yes
 Icebox: I like it how 5 years later and I need to read "fix it" and I still already know who's writing the message
 AntiSquid: and he is also low rank, mk
 MadKnight: it's not just my battles, it's everyone's battles to beat AntiSquid
 Icebox: some things never change huh 
 eulerscheZahl: fix it
 AntiSquid: lol
 MadKnight: my bot just goes to nearest drop
 RockyMullet: fix it Maddy
 AntiSquid: "drop" 
 anid: Can I switch 2 pacs in a single turn?
 eulerscheZahl: it's spreading, became a running gag already
 ZeroByter: Yes Anid
 AntiSquid: MadKnight they should demote your bot to wood 5
 ZeroByter: Each pac has his own individual cooldown
 anid: Ok, thanks zerobyter
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl I pasted ur link on forum bugs
 Illedan: Hi Icebox. Trying serious on this one?
 MadKnight: fix your overly straightforward joke AntiSquid
 ZeroByter: Also, I tried to implement a feature that would help my bot and it dropped my rank lol
 AntiSquid: fix your bot madao
 MadKnight: i will
 MadKnight: but now i'm too sleepy
 eulerscheZahl: found it cegprakashnot sure if it will ever get read, 86 messages already :oand most of them just users not understanding the game
 ZeroByter: man im bad at strategy
 ZeroByter: is rank 700 considered good?
 MadKnight: fix it is a local meme Icebox that's why we say that
 Adnmaster: does anybody know how to convert python3 to javascript, or another language?
 MadKnight: it's like F
 AyeshaMansoor: where the these branch code
 eulerscheZahl: 700 will get you to silver but probably not gold
 ZeroByter: oh nice. i can prob manage ~700
 MadKnight: Adnmaster try to find something via google
 Adnmaster: ok
 goolmoos: will all the leagues open tonight or just silver?
 MadKnight: silver
 ZeroByter: I think just silver, right?
 Icebox: Illedan I kinda missed the first 3 days due to some real life stuff
 cegprakash: is it possible to suicide into enemy position? like take my paper and go to his scissor position when he's not moving
 Icebox: aside from that, yeah I think I'll try going for it
 ZeroByter: Yeo
 ZeroByter: Yep
 Illedan: Nice :D
 ZeroByter: Happened to me
 ZeroByter: Not fun
 ZeroByter: Why would you do that though cegprakash?
 MadKnight: Icebox VS Illedan
 cegprakash: I don't want to do that
 cegprakash: that's why I need the condition
 MadKnight: but u could
 cegprakash: suppose he has a scissor and I move to him with a rock.. he decides to switch to paper 
 AntiSquid: MadKnight write a GA
 AntiSquid: how's your GA MadKnight&#160;?
 cegprakash: in this case will I die?
 Peudoki: yes ceg
 cegprakash: damn
 cegprakash: so chasing is a bad idea
 cegprakash: when he has cooldown
 wlesavo: cegprakash actually the rules are not particularly clear on this one, i would say you cant step on them if there are not moving, but i didnt check that
 wlesavo: they are
 struct: if they donjt move they will eat you
 struct: or you wil eat them
 struct: or you go back to prev cel
 cegprakash: wlesavo oh
 cegprakash: yeah that contradicts with eulerscheZahl's replay
 ZeroByter: Doesn't matter who moves into who. As soon as there is a collision (regardless of who initiated the collision and who was standing still), who dies is decided by rock-paper-scissors
 wlesavo: If the pacs are of different types, they can land on the same cell, but a pac can't cross the path of a stronger pac: it will be blocked.
 MadKnight: this is not a meme AntiSquid u can't just say that
 struct: the replay that euler posted is correct
 wlesavo: this is unclear to me
 cegprakash: why struct
 jthemphill: &gt; a pac can't cross the path of a stronger pac: it will be blocked
 struct: because there are 2 pacs of same type that moved into a cell
 struct: and their movement gets blocked
 jthemphill: oh we're still talking about the two-player three-pac situation
 struct: Think like this
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: makes sense
 struct: step 1: If 2 pacs from same player go to same cell their movement gets blocked
 ZeroByter: Are we&gt;
 ZeroByter:&#160;?
 goolmoos: how do the ranks work? cause I haven't submitted in a while and I am still climbing
 jthemphill: and then step 2 is two pacs of the same type get their movement blocked
 jthemphill: right?
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl it makes sense
 struct: step 2: if 2 pacs  of same type disregarding player go to same cell their movement gets blocked
 BlackOverlord: do we get information about ability cooldown of opponent's pacs?
 shashwat986: if they're visible, yes
 wlesavo: BlackOverlord yes
 goolmoos: yes
 ZeroByter: Nice
 struct: I think its like this
 BlackOverlord: cool, thanks
 struct: let me try 1 thing
 struct: wait like 5 min i wanna confirm someting
 AntiSquid: MadKnight is that your excuse to not write a GA? calling it a meme?
 goolmoos: Can you tell when you kill a pac around the corner?
 struct: no goolmoos
 wlesavo: struct you right, this chain collisions could be interestingCancelling a move may create new collisions. For this reason, the previous step is repeated until no new collisions are created.
 ZeroByter: So frustrating
 shashwat986: I think this submit, the RNG really likes me. I've lost only 2 of my first 20 games
 Doju: I think I have to delve into the scary task of precalculating paths
 Doju: with python
 Doju: D:
 shashwat986: yeah, my condolences
 Uljahn: use numpy and scipy ezpz
 Waffle3z: one problem I have is my own pacs having interfering paths. later pacs respond to earlier pacs claiming pellets but it doesn't go the other way
 shashwat986: took me an entire day to do something that is still at-best an approximation
 Beerus: does anyone know if its bad to call functions(that contains loops) on reading phase
 Doju: Luckily you can optimize the cost to like a quarter of the naive approach
 ZeroByter:&#160;? why would that be an issue?
 Doju: with a few super simple things
 Beerus: my reading elapsed time is ~50ms sometimes
 Waffle3z: the first pac I compute a decision for doesn't know what the rest of my pacs are going to do, the last pac does
 Waffle3z: in some cases maybe they would have made a different decision
 daanolav: why does it seem like other players always know which pellets I'v picked up, while I only know the ones I see / have seen?
 shashwat986: i use layers of strategy for that
 struct: okay Uljahn there is one step I missed
 Schneewittchen: #daanolav Predict the position of your enemies
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460597212">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460597212</a>
 struct: See turn 15 or something like that
 daanolav: but won't that take up too much time?
 Schneewittchen: It depends on your implementation
 struct: So if you move to a cell where a pac of yours was your movement gets canceled
 struct: I guess
 struct: pac of yours is*
 FrankR: Schneewittchen: any good tips for how to do so?
 daanolav: but even simple prediction will probably be better than none at all
 Schneewittchen: Look up Particle Filters
 Schneewittchen: For example
 FrankR: interesting idea.. thankss
 jthemphill: is particle filtering just keeping a list of all the possible places your opponents could be, like we did in sonar?
 Schneewittchen: Then you cancel out the paths of your enemy, if you see him, so you could know where he went and what pellets are on the field left
 Schneewittchen: #jthemphill Ya
 jthemphill: neat
 shashwat986: it was easier in sonar because you got to know the direction. here we don't know what an enemy has done
 struct: not sure it was easier
 jthemphill: oh but you need to backprop every time you see an enemy
 Flodnes: Will they open up higher leagues or is bronze the max?
 struct: Flodnes tomorrow silver opens
 jthemphill: you see them now, and you know how many turns ago you saw them last
 struct: There is still gold and legend after silver 
 jrke: silver wil open tommorow
 Flodnes: Thanks
 FrankR: struct: click on "Bronze League" and it'll show when the next one opens
 Waffle3z: I assume pellets are still there until I can see that they're not
 Waffle3z: oh there chat goes not scrolling again
 eulerscheZahl: struct knows when silver opens
 Quidome: schrodinger pellets
 Schneewittchen: He owns silver already
 Doju: Waffle3z that's what i'm doing as well
 shashwat986: so, broadly speaking, what rank do you guys think the bronze&gt;silver judge AI will be in today's leaderboard?
 jthemphill: is this sidebar chat actually one of the discord channels?
 Doju: it's pretty good for finding lone pellets in the endgame
 jrke: hey my time out in nested loop
 shashwat986: hey jrke
 shashwat986: made progress?
 Beerus: cin &gt;&gt; myScore &gt;&gt; opponentScore; cin.ignore();  this  has elapsed time ~40ms  , what the heck?
 shashwat986: the opponent is playing in that duration
 jrke: ya input also takes time
 shashwat986: it isn't a problem. your move time starts after you've taken input
 Beerus: oh damn
 Beerus: ~50ms is move time
 Beerus: i thought 100ms
 Waffle3z: bronze boss difficulty just depends on how many people they want to throw into silver right now ig
 Waffle3z: how does it usually work
 shashwat986: oh, hmm
 ZeroByter: Is it just me or are the bosses really easy this competition? They barely do anything, just roaming around randomly (atleast I think its randomly)
 Waffle3z: wood bosses aren't supposed to be strong
 ZeroByter: I mean all bosses
 Waffle3z: there are only wood bosses
 struct: There are only 2 bosses
 ZeroByter: oh
 shashwat986: so do they pick up the code of someone at the rank they want to cutoff at, or do they code a boss themselves?
 Quidome: tommorow there will be a bronze boss if you don't make the cut
 ZeroByter: i just thought they force the level of the boss to be what they want, regardless of how its actually doing
 struct: boss is a bot from a  playert
 struct: they choose one to become boss
 ZeroByter: mm ok
 Quidome: normally the lowest player promoted
 struct: and everyone above him gets instantly promoted
 Doju: Now that's a peculiar situation<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460604861">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460604861</a>
 Doju: starting around frame 100
 Quidome: I find this a really smart idea
 Quidome: @Doju that's clever play
 Quidome:&#160;:)
 Doju: It's accidental but yup that'd be an interesting idea to implement
 jthemphill: @Doju did red leave the super alone because eating the super would give their position away?
 eulerscheZahl: jupoulton2 at rank 744 might be a good boss (CG likes to choose themself as a boss)
 Doju: Not quite sure why it didn't eat the pellet
 RockyMullet: not interested by those dirty big pellets
 MonZtaDeluxe: is there already a referee available to downloadß
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020</a>
 MonZtaDeluxe: nice nice thank you
 dbdr: I found a serial killer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460610204">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460610204</a>
 ZarthaxX: LMAIO
 struct: yet you almost one
 struct: won*
 struct: my english rip
 Illedan: Might be viable if executed perfectly
 Neoncamouflage: I've debated designating one of the pacs as a sort of hunter/killer while the rest grab food. Not sure how it would work.
 ashikujjaman: is this a problem or my misunderstanding?
 shashwat986: dbdr that seems like a lot of bad luck :D two deaths on corners
 Counterbalance: ashikujjaman where? Are you running the referee locally?
 kovi: pentakill?
 Doju: Wow, almost none of the top players are running python
 Doju: are they actually utilizing all the time given?
 AntiSquid: python is very slow
 Doju: indeed
 E_pur_si_muove: dbdr: why could red (id=0 type scissor at pos x=23 y=6) kill 2 blues, when the second one was a ROCK?. It is turn 11.
 Doju: i'm not doing anything special and still have like 47 ms to spare per move
 Doju: that's enough for a bunch of things
 struct: E_pur_si_muove it only kills 1 blue?
 E_pur_si_muove: oh. sorry. ur. 2nbd blue won.&#160;:(
 ashikujjaman: my window showing only black screen
 thethiny: control F5
 thethiny: MaC: Command Shift R
 Counterbalance: control-shift-R
 shashwat986: Floyd warshall or BFS? my BFS is still timing out
 dbdr: E_pur_si_muove: the rock survives, no?
 dbdr: and the scissors die
 E_pur_si_muove: dbdr:yes, 2nd blue won.&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: which language shashwat986
 shashwat986: ruby
 E_pur_si_muove: anybody using CG-Local or CG-Sync w/ Chrome? None of them wants to work for me. I can't switch to local editor. ON cannot be selected. 
 eulerscheZahl: i like my copy-paste workflow
 shashwat986: I've used the fact that the graph is symmetrical along X
 Waffle3z: BFS once per cell
 shashwat986: I'm doing that. It's taking too long
 Counterbalance: bfs once per cell is the same order of complexity as FW
 Abhishek_Saini: At what time today, silver league will open?
 eulerscheZahl: no Counterbalance
 shashwat986: yeah, but FW has a better way of storing paths, right?
 eulerscheZahl: BFS is O(n). do that n times and you have O(n^2)
 eulerscheZahl: floyd warshall is O(n^3)
 shashwat986: hmm, maybe that's independent of the algo itself
 shashwat986: wait, what?
 Counterbalance: oh yeah indeed, eulerscheZahl
 Waffle3z: keep a queue, remove from the front, add neighbors, don't add previously visited cells, repeat until queue is empty
 eulerscheZahl: because it's a grid and only has very few neighbors for each cell
 eulerscheZahl: floyd warshall doesn't know about this
 shashwat986: @ Waffle3z and do this for every element in the map. Yes, I'm doing this
 Waffle3z: maybe ruby is just slow
 shashwat986: It works fine as long as I'm not storing the path
 shashwat986: The moment I'm appending to all those arrays to cache paths, it times out
 Waffle3z: I store the path, I keep a reference in each position to the parent and put the hierarchy into an array and that's the path
 shashwat986: what do you mean by parent?
 Waffle3z: {x = x, y = y, parent = last}
 Waffle3z: the previous node in the BFS that it came from
 shashwat986: oh, ok
 shashwat986: i think I get it
 shashwat986: thanks &lt;3
 Waffle3z: could also just store an array instead of a sort of linked list and duplicate it every time I expand a node
 Waffle3z: since I convert it into an array in the end anyway
 Waffle3z: oh I am already doing that
 Doju: xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darnit, i timeout on larege boards
 tobk: hm, pac on speed getting stuck in deadend with one more pellet to go
 BenWo: afternoon all
 eulerscheZahl: i've been there before tobk :D
 tobk: wants to pick of the pellet, then go one step back, but game just interprets it as "no move" (which is understadable given the output)
 eulerscheZahl: well, i only allowed targets 2 cells away. so i left the last pellet and returned later when the speed effect was over
 Nerchio: i feel like my bot is so bad and its in top5 :s
 eulerscheZahl: it's the frist weekend
 eulerscheZahl: everyone has a bad bot
 tobk: I get the best adjacent cell, and then the best adjacent of that when boosted (which then turned out to be the original cell)
 Nerchio: i know but its only 10day contest its not like there is forever to fix it :p
 avdg: and now its the time I find a terrible bug in my ai :D
 Nerchio: tobk you can't do that
 Nerchio: go back to your cell i mean in the same turn
 tobk: yes, I know, but did not thought of it before. fixed now
 wlesavo: Nerchio then fix it rn :slight_smile:
 Nerchio: i will start improving my bot again when silver opens
 eulerscheZahl: when silver opens, servers will be crying in pain
 wlesavo: roughly 700 ppl rerun
 Nerchio: who is usually the best java player? I thought it was valgrowth? or
 Nerchio: ah, wala
 Nerchio: similar nicknames :D
 eulerscheZahl: nmahoud e is doing well too
 wlesavo: walagrowth
 AntiSquid: when silver opens everything freezes :D
 Nerchio: lul
 struct: So many hungarians near the top
 wlesavo: as always
 Nerchio: imagine if Antisquid started coding in Java that would be fearsome
 eulerscheZahl: all from budapest even
 AntiSquid: why java?
 Nerchio: idk why not?
 Peudoki: Hungarians are big brain people
 AntiSquid: there's lots of new entries in the top actually
 avdg: I guess <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/pull/3">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/pull/3</a> will not get merged today :P
 AntiSquid: you ignore everyone else by saing that
 kovi: i must say it is very random
 AntiSquid: ya people go up and down like usually
 Nerchio: i just wanted to ask do you guys think it's a little random atm
 kovi: those who dont resubmit may stand
 Nerchio: i think i had a top50 submit and the next ended top5
 eulerscheZahl: i always climb a bit when i don't submit
 eulerscheZahl: 70 matches isn't enough for my bot in that huge league
 Nerchio: sometimes you can't do much about corner kills
 AntiSquid: next contest: 10k bronze, 30 games per submit
 struct: If contest had 10k in bronze would be very good
 eulerscheZahl: i only got 10 battles vs current top10
 Doju: How does the floating or sinking even work?
 Nerchio: cg: battle royale rock paper scissors edition
 eulerscheZahl: 4 of those against kovi
 Doju: When someone battles your bot it also affects your ranking?
 eulerscheZahl: not enough for a stable ranking
 eulerscheZahl: yes Doju
 avdg: contest of best random number generator? :D
 wlesavo: Nerchio i think this is a main randomize factor rn, should be better with better tracking implemented
 eulerscheZahl: (battle in the arena that is, not in the IDE)
 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh: hi
 AntiSquid: no best, just pure random avdg
 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh: c++ for life
 AntiSquid: fix your username hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 AntiSquid: and avatar
 eulerscheZahl: change the h into W, covers more space on the screen
 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh: :cry:
 wlesavo: avdg we have an optim for that :slight_smile:
 Nerchio: antisquid are you doing nn again thats why you are so far down
 AntiSquid: no
 ashikujjaman: can i submit solution multiple time?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AntiSquid: and who the hell wants to do NN in one week for a random contest, with varying grid size and other annoying factors Nerchio
 Nerchio: i guess you're right :D
 AntiSquid: i am lazy also
 Nerchio: what are the annoying factors
 eulerscheZahl: and fog of war
 Nerchio: fog of war?
 AntiSquid: i know what i need to do, i know how to add it, i don't feel like it
 wlesavo: didnt re curse pulled that one time? i heard some legends
 AntiSquid: so i slowly climb
 eulerscheZahl: not in a real contest wlesavo
 AntiSquid: i don't even have switch for my current version
 eulerscheZahl: in an "inofficial contest" that was actually just a community multiplayer game
 Doju: Taking other pacs into consideration is for noobs
 struct: only on BR which wasnt official
 wlesavo: oh, i see, still impressive
 struct: had some similarities with CSB
 mesavitae: Find fog of war only annoying for corner kills, but i mostly ignore the enemy and do my thing :D
 wlesavo: what was the game?
 eulerscheZahl: bitrunner 2048

 eulerscheZahl: i could easily reach legend with a single submit
 eulerscheZahl: wood1*

 eulerscheZahl: just submit and it will go away
 struct: ashikujjaman you need to wait until submit finished
 struct: finishes*
 ashikujjaman: How I will know my code is correct or better than other?
 struct: so you get promoted if you are above boss
 eulerscheZahl: you can submit again if it isn't any good
 ashikujjaman: yah thanks
 ashikujjaman: I have promoted to Wood 1 League:heart_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: that was quick
 eulerscheZahl: the contest or another game?
 avdg: 🎉
 struct: its on contest
 ashikujjaman: eulerscheZahl didn't understand.
 eulerscheZahl: are you playing the pacman game or something else?
 ashikujjaman: pacmanspring challenge
 AntiSquid: government model high school :thinking:
 ashikujjaman: AntiSquid: So what?
 shashwat986: Waffle3z I've just submitted my code based on the parent path storage. :fingers_crossed:
 eulerscheZahl: see AntiSquid: others get updates too
 AntiSquid: you're losing popularity or you have competition to fear
 wlesavo: AntiSquid i added smth to my code
 AntiSquid: thanks, don't let euler know from now on
 shashwat986: did I not thank eulerscheZahl&#160;? Dang it
 eulerscheZahl: it's fine shashwat986, i don't need these updates&#160;;)

 struct: A bit hard to tell on viewer
 eulerscheZahl: was visible
 eulerscheZahl: we both take single steps, not speeding
 eulerscheZahl: but i really dislike that aspect of the viewer: you never know which is a keyframe
 struct: So you completely ignore enemy?
 struct: It was a bit strange that you just go to his position, you even know that he was there
 eulerscheZahl: oh, now i got your question. at the moment of the kill he wasn't visible
 struct: ah
 eulerscheZahl: but i could see him going in that direction and assume him entering that path
 struct: So viewer is a bit confusing
 Thiesjoo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460653232">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460653232</a>AntiSquid you ask i deliver
 Nerchio: euler i personally think tracking in this game will be much harder than ooc
 Nerchio: but the top will surely need to implement it soon
 eulerscheZahl: yes and i'm totally not in a mood
 Schneewittchen: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: but if i want to compete, it's a must-have
 eulerscheZahl: and now i'm too far into it to stop
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BenWo: Thiesjoo do your pacs know how to use the tunnel?
 Thiesjoo: BenWo not yet, they also don't cooperate, so they all move in the same direction
 Schneewittchen: ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ) nono
 BenWo: yeah mine don't cooperate at all yet
 Thiesjoo: Just enemy bullying for now
 Thiesjoo: Works fine for me
 BenWo: I just have them pseudo-randomize their target based on their id
 eulerscheZahl: Thiesjoo why me?&#160;:(
 Waffle3z: I sort of have tracking, I expand everywhere an enemy might be by 2 spaces each turn, separately per-pac, reset it when I see one, and eliminate positions in line of sight. by the end the whole board out of sight is potential enemies so it's not very useful
 Thiesjoo: Sorry euler, was 1 lucky win
 Thiesjoo: First time for me beating someone in top 10
 eulerscheZahl: but shows a bug that i thought i fixed already
 tobk: how are the company/school rankings calculated, btw? just combined rank of top X coders?
 eulerscheZahl: your first kill
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not allowed to SPEED with an enemy in kill range
 Thiesjoo: I have that, but not on first round
 struct: I think its top 5 iirc
 Thiesjoo: I get higher rank with always speeding in the first turn
 dbf: attack/defence is a bit difficult here because of the same switch-speed cooldown&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but SPEED makes me vulnerable to that kind of kill
 Thiesjoo: True
 Nerchio: Waffle3z thats why I think the tracking system needs to be very delicate
 Nerchio: to avoid whats happening to your board state ^^
 eulerscheZahl: why do i have a copy of my own pacmen in the opponent pacman list?
 dbdr: self hate :D
 kovi: first turn copy?
 Nerchio: damn i got smashed out of top10 :D
 Peudoki: what are the typeIds of different weapons?
 Illedan: nice ameler
 eulerscheZahl: exactly kovi
 eulerscheZahl: i mirrored the position after but not the position backup that i use to restore the state
 jthemphill: Peudoki "ROCK", "PAPER", "SCISSORS"
 Waffle3z: interesting, you can collide with an enemy pac you can't even see because it's around a corner
 MSmits: well i finally have a monte carlo search working. It's not doing exactly what I want though
 MSmits: sometimes one of the pacs stops... I guess it found a best solution where the first turn one of the pacs doesnt move or something
 eulerscheZahl: i discarded the monte carlo idea already
 cegprakash: my eval just spreads over the map and stops going towards pellets :D
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't even finding the big pellets
 MSmits: do you use beamsearch eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: not reliably
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot what i do and go to bed now
 MSmits: lol
 Icebox: :wave: eulerscheZahl
 struct: :D
 MSmits: gn eulerscheZahl&#160;:)

 eulerscheZahl: yes

 Kellthazar: Okay, I' m losing my hair... I can't calculate all the distances between cells on 1000ms. What is the magic? My BFS algo seems fine, my graph structure too. I don't know where I messed up.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2nd submit on pac
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lets see if i get out of wood1
 Doju: Kellthazar are you doing bfs from point to point for every cell
 Nerchio: antisquid that looks like an unavoidable death
 Doju: or are you doing a single bfs from every cell that returns paths to every cell
 AntiSquid: was just wishing euler gn8, jeez, what's wrong with you Nerchio, overreacting
 struct: what?
 Nerchio: banter
 Kellthazar: #Doju yeah, I run bfs from point A to point B
 struct:&#160;:( already had my :popcorn: ready
 Kellthazar: Skipped when is already calculated
 Kellthazar: ex: point b to point a
 Doju: Kellthazar don't do that
 Doju: you're doing way too much work
 Doju: if you do that for every cell for every cell
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 11th in wood 1, darnit
 Doju: because then it runs O(n^3)
 Kellthazar: Yes, in my machine took 3 seconds
 Kellthazar: to calc a 35 x 15 grid
 struct: if you calculate distance from 0 0 to 1 1
 struct: you dont need to calculate distance from 1 1 to 0 0
 Kellthazar: I do that
 ashikujjaman: My video window does not showing anything. Please help me some one.
 Kellthazar: if the cell is a neighbor I skip as well
 Scarfield: neither from 0 0 to 0 1, 0 0 to 1 0 i suppose
 dbdr: euler broke my streak of 21 victories since beginning of submit :point_up:
 Doju: so but hold on let me just make this clear
 Kellthazar: I calc this before the game loop
 Doju: you're doing something like this:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the most competitors in php I've ever seen
 struct: which language Kellthazar?
 Kellthazar: Kotlin
 jthemphill: Kellthazar are you using Floyd-Warshall?
 Schneewittchen: Why not Floyd Warshall in the beginning?
 cegprakash: How do I debug Exception thrown: read access violation.other was 0x67360EF4.
 cegprakash: 	void operator += (Point &amp;other) {		x = (x + other.x + BOARD_WIDTH)&#160;% BOARD_WIDTH;		y = (y + other.y + BOARD_HEIGHT)&#160;% BOARD_HEIGHT;	}
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, got bumped to #2 in wood1, kewl beans
 Doju: because that's incredibly inefficient if i understand correctly
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460674063">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460674063</a>
 Kellthazar: #jthemphill I read about it, but I dont use it
 Illedan: wow, my pac just walks past the last pellet 
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Counterbalance: ceg: void -&gt;  Point &amp;
 AntiSquid: well once you reach bronze there's 2700 bots you need to defeat PatrickMcGinnisII
 Counterbalance: and a 'return *this'
 Nerchio: still 1st illedan :p
 Kellthazar: Can I link a pastebin here?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid well this is only 2ns submit in game for me
 Illedan: Yeah, and this code is 1st
 Illedan: hahaha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er 2nd
 Scarfield: quote from euler:BFS is O(n). do that n times and you have O(n^2)floyd warshall is O(n^3)
 dbdr: do you climb consistently Illedan?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan you using a Munkres job assignment algorithm?
 Doju: i think what kellthazar is doing is running the O(n^2) bfs for every cell
 Counterbalance: Kellthazar yes, but you can also directly paste here - chat has a builtin pastebin
 Doju: making it O(n^3)
 Illedan: I kept this rank for a lot of time now
 Illedan: Guess the randomness is bringing me some up and down
 dbdr: I mean, on a new submit
 Kellthazar: #Doju no, I do this calc before the while(true) loop
 Kellthazar: Pre turn
 jthemphill: Scarfield Kellthazar yeah the complexity is still O(n^3), but n is still pretty small...
 avdg: just make the first node a big bigger and its O(1) again :D
 Illedan: Didn't submit in 30 hours :P
 dbdr: :D
 Doju: I don't mean for every move
 avdg: *bit
 jthemphill: it shouldn't take 3 seconds to compute a distance matrix
 Doju: Kellthazar are you basically doing the thing that i linked?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I hope i get a bump to bronze
 dbdr: my code was 10th, made small changes, 80th, resubmit the same, 12th right now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan or are you GA'ing?
 Schneewittchen: #doju And you can cut it by half because dist(a -&gt; b) == dist(b -&gt; a)
 dbdr: bronze is big
 Illedan: Nope PatrickMcGinnisII
 Kellthazar: #Doju, yeah, somethink like that
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/4MECjQ03">https://pastebin.com/4MECjQ03</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: dbdr same, except it's between 110 and 80
 avdg: I made my code less clever and it's better
 AntiSquid: bronze is bigger than a nearly finished 10 day contest
 Scarfield: Kellthazar Schneewittchen typing #NewRoom creates a chat room, just the name to ping&#160;;)
 Schneewittchen: ☜(ಠ_ಠ☜)
 Counterbalance: #oh #noes #does #it #really #do #that? #:)
 Doju: Kellthazar so the thing is, you're running the bfs from point to point. You should be running it without an "end criterion"
 Doju: and instead store all the created paths
 Doju: voilà, there are your paths to every cell
 AntiSquid: #)
 Waffle3z: you're using bfs to find a path to one point when you can just let the bfs go to every point
 Kellthazar: :scream:
 Scarfield: xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bumped to bronze, tx guys
 Schneewittchen: Welcome to the matrix
 Doju: What I imagine he's doing irl atm
 Doju: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 PiterYeh: Kellthazar you should be doing a flood fill, not a bfs
 avdg: bumping to top 500 now
 Kellthazar: Jesus Christ...
 Doju: hahah
 Kellthazar: Ill make something coffee after this
 Doju: that's what i was initally doing to my pellets as well
 Doju: until i realized that it's mega dumb
 Scarfield: well floodfill is a type of bfs, so you are probably not that far of&#160;:)
 Waffle3z: bfs is flood fill
 JBM: what color is your bfs?
 Schneewittchen: Void
 Waffle3z: well, I guess the context makes it not really a search anymore, so it's just called flood fill then
 Doju: Waffle3z true
 Doju: btw, i'm about to start doing precalc as well
 AntiSquid: hey Nerchio i fixed a bug, euler is offline so i need to tell someone else <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460678344">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460678344</a>
 JBM: the FILL on most BASICs was documented as "flood", and it was anything but bfs
 cegprakash: is there an assertEquals in c++? my assert function is working good and throwing assertion error but how do I find the actual value? I am using assert(expected==current) now as this fails I need this current
 Doju: should i store the actual paths or just distances?
 Scarfield: you can floodfill without bfs per say, go left then down then right
 jthemphill: cegprakash you need to write your own assert_eq
 Waffle3z: breadth-first floodfill
 JBM: the actual value of what?
 Nerchio: WHAT WHAT THE BUG ANTISQUID
 Nerchio: I NEED TO KNOW
 AntiSquid: wdym&#160;? :p
 Nerchio: you said you fixed a bug
 Waffle3z: I store actual paths and distances. distance can also just be the length of the path
 avdg: position 334 now
 avdg: I guess my best position so far
 Doju: Waffle3z yes true
 Doju: i was just wondering if it's worth it to store the paths as well
 avdg: *322 now
 Doju: but maybe it's not that expensive since i need to create them anyways
 avdg: mine doesn't store paths, but dunno if that's a good suggestion as it only applies to my code
 AntiSquid: yes, hm i see i lost 2 bots vs you Nerchio, so i will have another bug that needs fixing :p
 Thiesjoo: Does somebody have a really agressive bot? I need it for testing
 avdg: I had to make calculations cheaper
 Scarfield: there is the pathfinding from the ref, so i suppose you dont actually need the path
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the manhattan dist to large pellets seems to do the job just fine
 Thiesjoo: Yeah patrick works fine till rank 400 something
 Cappefra: you don't see enemy pacs through warps?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm timing out on large boards with 5 pacs on large boards doing 5 floodfills
 struct: you see Cappefra
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wierd
 Nerchio: antisquid the replay you linked is vs gbiebyuc xD
 Cappefra: mh
 Nerchio: i lost to you in this submit actually
 AntiSquid: yes it is, but it showed your avatar initially
 AntiSquid: also as i said euler is offline so i told you instead
 jthemphill: AntiSquid why does blue 2 move west instead of north at t=41 in that replay? it looks like a sure kill to me
 Derthek: at what time is silver releasing tomorrow?
 avdg: did someone  fought against my ai yet?
 AntiSquid: jthemphill because i have a crappy bot
 Scarfield: 18:00 paris time
 Derthek: thanks

 BenjaminUrquhart: AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the puzzle of the week section just to come back to the code and
 solaimanope: reached top 50 :D
 AntiSquid: not now, he is offline AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: I'm not sure it was a good idea
 avdg: standing in each other way to disobey social distancing?
 Doju: gratz solaimanope
 RockyMullet: euler, seems like you broken your bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: I broke my bot too
 AntiSquid: all you need to do is beat the noobs in top 50 and get the prize solaimanope
 RockyMullet: well keep up the good work guys :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darn, pellett visibility
 solaimanope: Haha sure&#160;;) AntiSquid
 avdg: glad I'm 326th now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wth
 RockyMullet: if you guys break your bot enough I'll gain ranks
 Thiesjoo: Im gonna submit my half broken bot. It thinks it reached a pellet, but it actually didn't
 solaimanope: I had to switch to java, because I was getting some weird RTE in C++. Wasted two days trying to find bug.
 AntiSquid: RTE?
 Nerchio: RTE is a kind of a IDK
 Thiesjoo: IDK?
 solaimanope: I was getting some weird sort of error. Saying double free or something like that.
 Nerchio: I dont know Thiesjoo :D
 AntiSquid: RTE = real time error&#160;? :o
 solaimanope: Although I didn't use any pointers
 solaimanope: Run Time Error
 sanpas83: run time error :o&#160;? :o
 AntiSquid: run time environment
 RockyMullet: dont anger the C++
 BenjaminUrquhart: random tack ejector
 ws1088: so we can trap opponents?
 RockyMullet: you must tame the beast
 AntiSquid: i get a lot of errors not knowing what they are, but i know how to look for them solaimanope
 avdg: Don't c#
 AntiSquid: in c++ i mean
 RockyMullet: ws1088 define trap
 avdg: if you know what I mean&#160;;-)
 avdg: I guess nobody knows&#160;;/
 RockyMullet: I... dont
 solaimanope: AntiSquid I am not a good debugger&#160;:(
 ws1088: in a path trap the opponents by putting my pac on each end
 RockyMullet: ws1088 oh yeah, personnaly I only do it in dead ends for now
 Zenoscave: Rocky you consider opp path?
 RockyMullet: but it can achieved with 2 bots for sure
 RockyMullet: but im lazy
 josegomez: any idea what causes the game to stop when no "stop" condition is met?I keep getting stopped when there are pacs left a plenty and so are pellets
 Nerchio: the point is if your cooldown is 0 your opponent can't really kill you efficiently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm close to top 2k, if so i can quit today, then the guys going to silver can get out of the way
 RockyMullet: whats opp&#160;?
 struct: opponent
 Zenoscave: opponent
 cegprakash: this access violation is hard to debug
 Nerchio: opponent
 cegprakash:&#160;:@&#160;:@
 RockyMullet: ah yeah, I check if I can reach the shoke point before the enemy
 AntiSquid: O++ new language
 Zenoscave: what access violation
 cegprakash: i get some junk values
 ws1088: alternatively you can trap yourself!
 Zenoscave: shoke point?
 avdg: &lt;++
 cegprakash: even though I set all values in constructor
 RockyMullet: my bot is a good killer, but I'm afraid to say that in front of eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: RockyMullet "Whats shoke?"
 Hvosten: I'm writing in groovy, bui it seems slow. I have to return to java&#160;:/
 ws1088: trapping yourself is to fence off a region exclusively to youself
 Zenoscave: thanks Astrobytes
 RockyMullet: *choke point
 Astrobytes: :D
 RockyMullet: english is hard :cry:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: choked by your mullet, shoked
 Astrobytes: stop typing phonetically RockyMullet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shonuff
 AntiSquid: chval point
 RockyMullet: when everything fails, I guess how its written :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 RockyMullet: also its written "shoke" all over my code
 RockyMullet: there's no turning back
 AntiSquid: the only good thing about bronze you gets lots of easy win streaks, makes you feel less bad about your shitty bot
 RockyMullet: self esteem is important
 tobk: what's a good algo for choke/shoke points? I wondered since CoIaF
 Doju: Okay i think i have my precalc function with 0 optimizations ready. Any guesses on how long it'll take? I'm running python.
 BenjaminUrquhart: 2 hours
 Doju: lol benjamin :D
 jthemphill: tobk check out the tron postmortem <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2010/03/04/google-ai-postmortem.html">https://www.a1k0n.net/2010/03/04/google-ai-postmortem.html</a>
 Scarfield: somewhere between 4 ms and a million years
 Doju: i sure hope not that long
 Waffle3z: at least 0
 RockyMullet: tobk lol
 Astrobytes: tobk think you wanna check articulation points
 jthemphill: tobk see the bit about connected components
 Counterbalance: 300ms
 Doju: just fixing some bugs first...
 Counterbalance: place your bets
 Astrobytes: +what jthemphill said
 Scarfield: -what i said
 Doju: 900ms!
 Doju: i'm super happy
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 AntiSquid: tobk you mean CIF&#160;? 
 jthemphill: a whole 100ms to spare :grinning:
 Doju: and that's on a large map with absolutely no optimizations
 Doju: i bet i can squeeze that down to like 200
 tobk: I meant Code of Ice and Fire, not sure what's the official acronym
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok 2124th, 3 total submits...200 lines of code...man I'm lazy
 tobk: those were a big thing there (cutting of opponent regions), never really got a hang of them there
 Astrobytes: The logical one is CoIaF but it was usually CoIF or CIF for reasons unknown
 muy31: Kellthazar are you using an optimized technique?
 AntiSquid: "of" "and" and other binding words are left out from acronyms afaik
 tobk: thanks, "articulation point" really helped. is there a way to do the same for e.g. two nodes separating a graph?
 AntiSquid: so CIF is most logical imo
 Kellthazar: #muy31 No, I guess
 muy31: just realizing i was reading a comment from over two hours ago...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: voroni on pacman not really a great idea imho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: djikstra still costly
 Kellthazar: #Doju thanks, I think that #euller or another person told about the flood fill technique, but I dont gave the necessary attention
 Zenoscave: Kellthazar you don't need the # in front of names to notify them
 cegprakash: submitting my first sim version :D :D 
 Zenoscave: gl ceg
 Doju: gl gl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: flooding still the best unless you sim to a decent depth or munkres...anyone munkres I wanna see it
 cegprakash: with no pellets tracking and depth = 1
 Kellthazar: Oh, thanks Zenoscave
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pew pew cegprakash
 Scarfield: munkres?
 muy31: yeah the "#" opens a new room w/ that name
 cegprakash: aw it took two days to code this sim
 Kellthazar: My pre calc works like a charm now... XD
 Zenoscave: PatrickMcGinnisII Munkres means hungarian algo?
 Doju: Nice to hear Kellthazar
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes Zenoscave <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://csclab.murraystate.edu/~bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html">http://csclab.murraystate.edu/~bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html</a>
 Zenoscave: I thought that was for cost asssignment
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well you can modify for benefit instead o min
 Scarfield: it seems to be, just looked at i quickly
 Zenoscave: Hmmm I fail to see how that would help
 Astrobytes: tobk I'm no expert in graph theory but if there's two nodes separating two sets of connected components it's just a set of separating nodes/vertices rather than a single articulation point
 Zenoscave: Astro you mean like Min Cut Max Flow?
 Astrobytes: Don't ask me I'm a bilogist!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Zenoscave I guess I just was trying to figure out how to assign collection and attack tactics
 Astrobytes: *biologist!
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes do you work with nano bots&#160;;)
 Waffle3z: wouldn't it be two articulation points
 tobk: a, that name rings a bell. probably read it during CIF but was too lazy to implement it&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave tobk was wondering about having two+ articulation points separating the graph.And no :D
 tobk: and yes, I guess for two points, you could check whether the combination of each point with one of its neighbors makes a cut
 ashikujjaman: why this error: has not provided 1 lines in time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: whoever does the most sims usually does really well in these things...which I'm not gonna get...so decision-making alternatives need to be really fast
 Astrobytes: So Zenoscave, yeah I think that would be min cut max flow
 Zenoscave: I looked further. It would be mincut of the dual graph.
 ashikujjaman: why this error: has not provided 1 lines in time:worried:
 Astrobytes: Oh ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: timeout ashikujjaman
 Zenoscave: an articulation point is a cut vertex. min cut deals with edges
 Kellthazar: ashikujjaman timeout 
 Doju: ashikujjaman you didn't print a line fast enough. So that means you either have a bug or really slow code
 Zenoscave: flip vs to es and you have it
 Astrobytes: Right, gotcha
 Astrobytes: I must refresh my graph theory at some point&#160;:/
 Doju: and it's almost certainly a bug unless oyu have some fancy things in your code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: darn, my ass hurts...yall have fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ashikujjaman you could have an infinite loop
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII :o
 tobk: ashikujjaman Maybe just some case you did not consider that makes your code not enter the printing-path? maybe no visible pellets?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gotta rethink the visible pellets, that really threw me
 cegprakash: I easily get 90000 simulations :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but all the input is there to figure it out
 cegprakash: it's so amazing to watch
 Astrobytes: I was more concerned about your ass hurting PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, i need a new desk chair
 ws1088: 90000 simulations per turn?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes tx for your concern
 Waffle3z: what's one simulation
 cegprakash: yup :D ws1088
 cegprakash: Waffle3z 1 random try
 Illedan: 90k?
 Astrobytes: Context is everything PatrickMcGinnisII, thank you for the clarification :D
 AntiSquid: finally broke into top 100 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 90k is impressive!
 Waffle3z: MCTS rollouts?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: uh oh got Illedan 's attn
 ws1088: oh 1 random try without lookahead?
 cegprakash: out off 90K may be 30K is valid sims
 cegprakash: not sure
 Zenoscave: cegprakash what league?
 cegprakash: bronze ofc
 AntiSquid: ceg being random
 Illedan: I have 12 k sims in 4 ms :P 
 ws1088: a simulation is usually evaluating score based on move with lookahead
 AntiSquid: ceg with 90k why still 1k rank&#160;?
 cegprakash: I need to add pellets prediction
 cegprakash: like based on fog of war
 Zenoscave: Easy. The sim is inaccurate because he didn't read the rules
 cegprakash: that should definitely take me to top 100
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: xD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: aren't all the boards full of pells?
 Illedan: kovi, chill :scream:
 Astrobytes: ceg's getting better at reading the statement now Zenoscave since we've trolled him so hard about it&#160;:)
 Scarfield: ceg actually quoted the statement yesterday, im still in shock
 AntiSquid: i just have a search, no sim yet, but seriously with a 90k sim i am sure icould get1st
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh u can't see enemies either
 Zenoscave: That is good to hear!
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 kovi: illedan, lets wait till the end
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall in top 600 need to get out of the way, I'll be back when silver opens
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: g'nite
 avdg: welcome to the club
 Illedan: Yeah, but 50% progress and already at 2nd
 avdg: I guess my bot is an amateur vs 2nd :p
 Illedan: I'm hoping for you to beat me very much, so I get my motivation back :P
 Astrobytes: Yo avdg, thanks for making the PR earlier and sorry if I seemed a bit grumpy :D
 avdg: np
 avdg: some people had such moods
 avdg: I've seen both
 avdg: people who were mad for few seconds
 avdg: and people who are never happy
 Astrobytes: I'm usually happy&#160;;)
 kovi: and with that i take my leave
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: Sweeeeet, something to fight
 Illedan: :nerd:
 Kellthazar: gratz kovi
 Illedan: 1.3 lead :D
 cegprakash: Game Summary:Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move:cegprakash:- Pac 0 moved to (13, 6).
 cegprakash: what does this mean
 kovi: probably lucky rolls, but definitely some improvement
 Scarfield: when speed ability is activated, its basicly an extra move turn for the pacs with speed
 Illedan: The important is to have a bot ready for testing when silver opens tomorrow to get a ton of games :D
 Scarfield: i can never remember.. whats the usual&#160;% for bronze to silver?
 Uljahn: around 40
 Cappefra: also when will gold open_
 Cappefra:&#160;?
 Uljahn: in two days after silver
 cegprakash: Scarfield I understand that
 cegprakash: but why does game summary say that
 Astrobytes: Wednesday Cappefra
 Cappefra: cooll!
 cegprakash: I print MOVE 0 13 6 
 cegprakash: it moves
 Astrobytes: OH Uljahn beat me to it
 cegprakash: but prints that message
 Illedan: Off to bed. Good night!
 Scarfield: gn
 Cappefra: who creates the bots btw?
 Astrobytes: gn
 Astrobytes: The bosses Cappefra?
 Scarfield: a player bot is selected from the LB
 Cappefra: yeah
 Astrobytes: What Scarfield said
 Cappefra: oh ok cool
 Astrobytes: From Bronze+ that is
 Scarfield: idk cegprakash, i just started with doing my own sim, havent even used abilities yet
 Cappefra: so like if the player that writes the gold bot is selected, that guy automatically goes to legend?
 Astrobytes: Wood bosses come from the game authors
 Cappefra: and that's the cutoff?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 AntiSquid: about 40-50% promote, but who knows 
 Cappefra: silver will also be overcrowded from the start more or less
 AntiSquid: 2800 already
 AntiSquid: plenty of time for 200 more&#160;?
 Cappefra: yeah that's crazy!
 Cappefra: did ooc even get to 2800 when it ended?
 thethiny: I'm gonna submit an aI that doesn't move
 thethiny: see if I win
 Scarfield: nope
 avdg: otherBot crashes at turn 1
 Scarfield: 2279 on ooc
 avdg: loc?
 avdg: 803 here inc comments
 Scarfield: ocean of code
 avdg: ah
 avdg: 508th
 Scarfield: nice
 AntiSquid: i reached 600 somehow, but messy
 Cappefra: I liked ooc, though I had a bunch of troubles with the tracking and checking whether the enemy hit itself and stuff
 AntiSquid: i still hate ooc more than this game
 avdg: its more complex
 Cappefra: and also I was a bit stuck in silver 
 AntiSquid: hidden info and round the corner kill and RPS is annoying but ooc was more annoying
 Cappefra: it was more annoying but more predictable
 AntiSquid: nothing to do with complexity, just the hidden info and then should i use mine or torpedo, lots of tracking ... and other bs
 Scarfield: bfs* 
 Scarfield: :p
 AntiSquid: i mean in terms of what i disliked
 Cappefra: lol
 AntiSquid: were the mines more predictable&#160;?
 avdg: they are kinda hard to track
 AntiSquid: i think it's easier to guess pac locations in this game than mines in ooc
 avdg: esp when the opponent jumps
 Cappefra: well, no... I guess everything up to mine avoidance
 avdg: but otherwise you had to backtrack its moves
 Astrobytes: I don't like this game much either tbh, that's partially due to my pain medication however :P
 Cappefra: mine avoidance was a bitch. So much so that I didn't even implement it :D
 Astrobytes: How I've coded anything at all is a mystery to me
 Cappefra: when I made gold I was like k bye
 avdg: (backtrack from all options)
 Doju: Any people who know python here?
 Astrobytes: Nope
 Scarfield: yea, but havent used it for a long time
 Astrobytes: Everyone knows everything except Python
 Cappefra: not really a python guy
 Doju: so i have __iter__ and __next__  methods in my grid class to loop over it by doing for cell in grid
 Doju: but my generate_paths function runs in __init__
 avdg: kinda beginner if it comes to the python language itself :p
 Doju: and uses "for cell in self"
 Doju: and it only runs once
 Doju: except maybe sometimes it doesnt???
 Doju: i'm so confused
 Astrobytes: Welp. So am I after your statement.
 Scarfield: hmm never really used classes in python, switched to c++ when i started learning that :p
 Abhishek_Saini: Hey guysI have a doubt regarding pac vision.Do pac only see along the line it's facing, or it can see other line too.Like if my pac is moving in horizontal direction, can it also see along the vertical line&#160;?
 goolmoos: Doju, try to implement __iter__ as a genrator, it is mush 
 goolmoos: much
 goolmoos: easier 
 Cappefra: yeah Abhishek, there's a picture with the line of sight in the description
 avdg: Abhishek_Saini all directions
 Astrobytes: It can see in all directions Abhishek_Saini
 Doju: umm, okay i'll do that
 Cappefra: you'll see that the blue guy is in the situation you're describing
 AntiSquid: people even ignore the pictures
 ashikujjaman: what it means: Only PINKY still has pacs standing!PINKY wins with 286 pellets
 Cappefra: that he killed all your pacs
 goolmoos: ashikujjaman, he ate all your pacs
 Scarfield: pinkys opponent lost all his pacs, and pinky has the most pellets
 ashikujjaman: how can eat my pac?didn't found in statement or I mised it
 goolmoos: are you in the wood league?
 ashikujjaman: yes
 muy31: no eating till bronze
 goolmoos: then he can't eat them yet
 Scarfield: timeout maybe?
 ashikujjaman: how can I give my games link?
 tutubalin: 100 bytes in JS to exit Wood 2&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ashikujjaman click the 'Replay and Share" button in the viewer
 Scarfield: there is a "replay and share" button next to the settings in the viewer
 Scarfield: arg
 wi_lius: @ashikujjaman it's an immediate loss if you submit invalid commands (e.g. try to move outside the bounds, to corrdinates that are negative or exceeding width/height)
 Astrobytes: lol tutubalin
 ashikujjaman: I got it thanks
 wi_lius: @ashikujjaman try reading through "Console output" panel, it might have a description what happened
 Cappefra: I just submitted a code with a syntax error lol
 Astrobytes: Cappefra there's a reason for "You did not test your answer. Do you still want to submit your code?" :P
 avdg: probably just rick rolling
 Cappefra: thing is I thought I only changed a parameter but apparently I also deleted a parenthesis haha
 Scarfield: btw doju, i guess you would need to loop over your grid by first the row, then the cells in the row. Supposing your grid is a 2D array of cells
 avdg: I guess someone might do a great find if my ai still bumps together
 Neoncamouflage: Submitted new code. Dropped 1400 ranks. Oh god &gt;.&lt;
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have found bug!
 AntiSquid: ping someone and tell them
 avdg: Cappefra: is it normal that your ai has bad defence?
 avdg: (my ai likes to do nothing when it finds nothing near on the other hand :p)
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460745484">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/460745484</a>
 Doju: Scarfield actually i'm trying to loop over it using the custom iterating thing that i made with dunder methods
 avdg: I'm 3rd in my country atm :p
 AntiSquid: UK leaderboard unusually crowded this time :p
 AntiSquid: nearly 3rd
 ashikujjaman: I have only printed some MOVE then why this?Has not provided 1 lines in timecan I give my codes link?
 BenjaminUrquhart: spot the bug<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460748763">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460748763</a>
 avdg: doesn't move on speed?
 AntiSquid: ah nerchio you're still online, i fixed a bug btw :p
 AntiSquid: 100 more bugs to go
 avdg: you keep speeding
 avdg: but didn't released the clutch
 BenjaminUrquhart: pay more attention to the board
 BenjaminUrquhart: you're seeing the results of the bug, not the cause
 avdg: still an amazing way to win
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's default AI
 avdg: still, blind crash
 avdg: don't get it
 BenjaminUrquhart: it won't start moving until the last super pellet is gone
 BenjaminUrquhart: guess who screwed up some logic :eyes:
 MiniWall: Hi, anyone know at which hours league generaly open&#160;? :D
 Counterbalance: 6 PM CEST
 avdg: you still got 3
 BenjaminUrquhart: usually noon EST
 AntiSquid: 18 hours from now
 MiniWall: oh ok thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: close enough
 Cappefra: @avdg I think both my pacs there died cause I already gave the move to the position they die at
 BenjaminUrquhart: same game, bug fixed<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460756311">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460756311</a>
 Cappefra: like there's no way of stopping that without tracking opponents
 InspiratioN: i am stuck in ascii
 InspiratioN:&#160;:(
 Cappefra: and at step 75 I switch to the wrong type cause I assume you want to kill me too :D but you didn't switch so I end up switching to the losing type
 avdg: mine is slightly influenced by estimated opponent position&#160;;-)
 InspiratioN: i print manhattan but in new lines
 InspiratioN: lol
 InspiratioN: is it good this website to improve my basic python coding?
 InspiratioN: i am beginner
 TheOnlyJoker: yes sure!
 Cappefra: that is good. I don't think I'll try and track my enemies, I'd probably end up putting a lot of effort into it for minimal to none advantage
 InspiratioN: any good place to guide myself to solve the puzzles?
 Cappefra: not cause it can't be done but cause I'd probably mess it up
 TheOnlyJoker: Cappefra 3000IQ
 TheOnlyJoker: lmao
 BenjaminUrquhart: Cappefra 3 blind deaths, still won<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460759005">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460759005</a>

 BenjaminUrquhart: why do you still have that link
 avdg: its just 1 hover away without that link in chat
 Cappefra: wow ben that is a fight to the last blood
 Cappefra: cool game lol
 Counterbalance: cause I thought it was cool&#160;;)
 avdg: barely won :P
 o_imej: hey, why when enemy use speed boost it slow down my pac&#160;? 
 Counterbalance: yes
 Astrobytes: that was you BenjaminUrquhart?  Or you re-upped it? RPS was cool
 Neoncamouflage: It looks like it does, but they're just getting an extra turn
 BenjaminUrquhart: Astrobytes that's the original one
 o_imej: but i use it too and the enemy pacs won't slow down 
 avdg: o_imej it's because speed boost adds more steps to the game
 MSmits: yay, back in top 100&#160;:)
 avdg: nice one MSmits
 Astrobytes: I submitted in one, may have been a different user unless you had multiple versions. When was this?
 MSmits: took me a while. These kinds of games are not so easy for me
 AntiSquid: when were you in top 100 before? 
 MSmits: 2 days ago i think
 AntiSquid: i saw you around 242 ... maybe i should play this more often
 MSmits: today yes
 MSmits: it got worse over the last 2 days, no new bot
 AntiSquid: well done anyway, but seems like bot quality isn't that high yet
 AntiSquid: i mean the leaderboard, not you
 MSmits: mine certainly isn't. I finally got some semblance of a search working
 MSmits: multi agent searching is not my thing
 MSmits: well unless i can smitsi it 
 MSmits: but thats not possible here
 MSmits: but I have a list... we'll see how far I get this time. My goal is legend 
 Astrobytes: 10 smitsi trees :love:
 Astrobytes: :heart:
 jthemphill: why is smitsi not possible here?
 Cappefra: what's smitsi?
 MSmits: thats what I did for PCR, could be more even. But you cant do it here because opponents block you
 MSmits: and you even block yourself
 jthemphill: Cappefra it's called smitsimax <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax">https://tech.io/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax</a>
 jthemphill: huh
 MSmits: the idea about smitsi is that you have incoherent states. Nodes dont correspond to actual gamestates, they correspond to move orders
 MSmits: as long as the same actions are always possible for each move order, it works fine
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's clearly named after MSmits
 MSmits: but in this case, sometimes a pac may be able to move in a direction and sometimes it cant, depending on what opponents do
 Astrobytes: You need IS-Smitsimax
 Nerchio: MSmits 26? nice!
 BenjaminUrquhart: this submit is taking a while
 jthemphill: MSmits but wasn't that true with CSB as well? pods block each other in that game
 MSmits: lol, the search is pretty crap, it goes depth 6. It has problems finishing a game with far away pellets. This could be much better
 MSmits: jthemphill yes, but you can still do the same moves
 MSmits: you can still steer the same and use the same power
 MSmits: in pacman thats not the case, if someone blocks "up", you cant do the action 
 Astrobytes: Filter out the invalid states, as in ISMCTS
 jthemphill: ^
 MSmits: hmm sure, you might be able to get something working that way, but there is also a "softer" problem of when the agents decisions are strongly dependent on eachother
 MSmits: smits works best when they are weakly dependent
 Astrobytes: Hm, yeah I see your point
 MSmits: but it also depends a bit on how well the other searches perform. If they're all crap, well then...
 Astrobytes: But I guess it also depends on how close you want your pacs to work together
 MSmits: this is why it worked in XR when it shouldn't
 MSmits: right Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I mean, theoretically they can work *almost* indeopendently
 ZarthaxX: MSmits what are u doing?
 Astrobytes: Or even independently
 ZarthaxX: 25 gz
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: smitsi?
 MSmits: monte carlo, i said before
 ZarthaxX: plz no
 MSmits: my first monte carlo ever
 ZarthaxX: random?
 ZarthaxX: nice
 MSmits: well not counting my zombies default bot when not hardcoding
 ZarthaxX: complex eval?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: eat pellets
 MSmits: thats about it
 Tyir: anything to avoid collision? better score for pellets away from other pacs?
 MSmits: I was busy all day debugging. Because of collisions 
 MSmits: basically i just dont move when it causes a collision
 MSmits: so it will reduce score
 MSmits: the speed move turn makes things really hard to sim
 Astrobytes: most importantly: bitboarded? :P
 MSmits: 1 part of it yes, but a very tiny part, most is not
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: now I wanna bitboard it to make it faster though&#160;:(
 MSmits: seems hard to do
 Astrobytes: But doable. Not sure you'd gain anything perf. wise tho
 MSmits: I use a lot of pointers between cells and pacs
 MSmits: Think i am going to skip bitboarding this. I already sacrificed a lot of ease of coding by switching to c++
 Counterbalance: :nauseated_face:board&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: btw, did you encounter the phasing pac bug?
 MSmits: in your bot i mean
 Tyir: you do any tricks for guessing pellet positions?
 MSmits: it happens when you have 2 pacs next to eachother and they move to eachothers position. Technically the move isnt blocked because the positions are free
 avdg: assume all positions are pellets?
 MSmits: it's an annoying edge case
 MSmits: I dont do much about guessing yet
 MSmits: it's on my list
 jthemphill: MSmits how do you account for the simultaneous-choice nature of the game with mcts?
 Tyir: i have some ideas; but i need to write some better base code 
 MSmits: oh jthemphill when i said monte carlo, i meant monte carlo
 MSmits: there is no tree
 icecream17: ceg has a hihger rank....
 jthemphill: MSmits woah okay
 MSmits: I just try a bunch of random :poop: and then pick the moves that led to the best result
 MSmits: best result being eating more pellets
 MSmits: I assume all opponents stationary atm
 jthemphill: wait i thought you said you searched with depth 6
 MSmits: yes only 6
 MSmits: so my bot gets stuck when no pellet is within 6
 MSmits: it starts to move randomly
 jthemphill: but... isn't that a tree?
 avdg: hmm mine does that  too despite having an algorithm against that
 MSmits: it just means i pick random moves 6 times
 jthemphill: huh
 MSmits: i dont save the information
 jthemphill: ah
 avdg: but I guess I know why...
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460776604">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460776604</a>
 avdg: some functions are lying to my ai :p
 MSmits: BenjaminUrquhart it might have thought there are pellets there
 BenjaminUrquhart: is that why it froze in place?
 MSmits: which frame?
 BenjaminUrquhart: 23
 avdg: turn 20: nothing to see here
 MSmits: ah
 BenjaminUrquhart: all the way until it gets eaten at frame 34
 MSmits: no it was afraid to move
 MSmits: your paper pac
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 MSmits: its  a bug
 MSmits: need to fix that
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool
 MSmits: basically my bot is blocked from going to places where you bot can reach
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 MSmits: but its not going right somehow... I thought i fixed it
 MSmits: I'm gonna get some sleep. Have fun all. 
 berries: my code is giving me an error on a line that was part of the default code wtf
 berries: is anybody getting that row might not have been initialized in java
 MSmits: berries, thats possible if your input/output situation is not synchronized
 MSmits: the game will be on a different turn than your bot is
 berries: MSmits what do you mean
 Counterbalance: no it's a compilation error, right?
 berries: yeah its compilation
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: nvm then
 berries: havent even got the pac moving yet ffs
 muy31: nullpointer?
 muy31: or what type of error
 muy31: exactly
 Counterbalance: line 18 - for (int i .. ) {  String row = ...' }you probably moved String row before the loop and access it after the loop?
 berries: it literally just says error, i might put it into eclipse to check
 muy31: can you paste a snippet?
 berries: of the error or the code that gave me it
 muy31: the code

 Icebox: "I use a lot of pointers between cells and pacsThink i am going to skip bitboarding this. I already sacrificed a lot of ease of coding by switching to c++" MSmits saaaame
 MSmits: hi Icebox&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: ah, row is not initalized..  String row[] = new String[35]; should fix it
 MSmits: it says on the leaderboard your rank is 2,55 Icebox
 muy31: row[] needs to be initialized
 MSmits: thats between  2 and 3, good job
 berries: okay thanks
 Icebox: MSmits didn't submit yet
 muy31: oh yah, its String[] row
 Icebox: rewrote everything in c++ first
 MSmits: nice
 muy31: not Sring row[]
 MSmits: i thought that was against the Icebox principle
 Icebox: my current code is just a bunch of stars and ampersands derefferencing the complete pointer and iterator spaghet
 MSmits: python only right?

 berries: anybody know wtf this means
 MSmits: so it seems
 avdg: your array is too small
 muy31: yes
 muy31: String[] row = new String[LENGTH];
 muy31: LENGTH should be width
 muy31: or heigh
 muy31: *height

 berries: thats where its giving me the error
 berries: that 2d array is just what im using to keep the pellet values 
 muy31: the width+1 and height+1 is switched around
 muy31: cause if i is for height and j is for width
 berries: ahh that fixed that part thanks
 muy31: no prob
 berries: should most of my arrays be [y][x] instead of [x][y]
 muy31: yes
 berries: alright time to go back through it all
 berries: i appreciate the help
 berries: im new to this
 struct: its user preference
 struct: either one is fine
 Kukiss: Hello Icebox, any stream coming?I remember I enjoyed yours the most&#160;:)
 muy31: it's all good, keep working on it berries

 Neoncamouflage: I must be blind, but how do I set the messages I see over some people's pacs
 Neoncamouflage: I swear I've read this summary 15 times trying to find it
 BenjaminUrquhart: put text after that pac's command
 muy31: b/c your for loop is configured to go from 0 to height - 1 berries
 Neoncamouflage: Thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's not officially in the statement but it's tradition for most CG contests to have the feature
 berries: okay thanks ill change it back to that
 muy31: :relaxed:
 BenjaminUrquhart: Waffle3z is that switch logic in your submitted bot?

 BenjaminUrquhart: doesn't work around corners
 Tyir: waffle3z what is your secret sauce?
 Waffle3z: it can't see you
 struct: elderlybeginner what do you mean extra options?
 BenjaminUrquhart: think about it for a second
 BenjaminUrquhart: you don't need to see it
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;;)
 Waffle3z: it doesn't know which pac it is or the type so it doesn't know what to switch to
 BenjaminUrquhart: well clearly I can't see you either and I figured out how to deal with it
 elderlybeginner: struct there was something like ctrl+; to open additional options for editor
 struct: f1
 struct: editor changed
 elderlybeginner: oh, yea, I noticed but didn't know the shortcut was changed, thank you
 njaber: How many hours till the league opens?
 JBM: 17
 njaber: Nice, I should have time to finish my bot update before then
 JBM: famous last words
 njaber: Yeah you're right, I probably woun't
 njaber: won't*
 JBM: who knows
 icecream17: 987th! Yas
 njaber: I still haven't finished the enemy possible pos/path calculator I've been working on for hte past 30h
 njaber: Tho I'm starting to get some nice results
 avdg: I've done it in few hours... but it only has a few features
 avdg: though it had some complications when I implemented it
 njaber: I'm working on an algorithm that gets perfect path elimination with the given info
 njaber: But once I'm done this will prove very useful... I hope
 avdg: hard thing is that you sometimes don't know you killed someone I guess?
 avdg: dunno about blind corners
 njaber: My algorithm shouldhelp me detect that in most cases
 avdg: it's like, that is easy, oh nothing to see here (while you killed one on the previous move)
 njaber: yeah but I should be able to deduce that a pac WAS killed given pellet info etc in most of the cases
 BenjaminUrquhart: I want to be in the top 100 by silver opening and I keep landing just under that mark
 muy31: why is the number of turns changing when i am just changing an error printout? there is no math.random and the outcome/moves dont change
 BenjaminUrquhart: currently 103
 avdg: mine works slightly more pessimistic I guess and wouldn't have to rule that out
 njaber: JS?
 njaber: muy31
 avdg: though combining all the known information is kinda hard
 BenjaminUrquhart: muy31 is your opponent random?
 avdg: and probably not worth it
 muy31: no
 muy31: ill show you
 Icebox: @Kukiss I might do one tomorrow&#160;:)
 muy31: wait maybe
 muy31: but the first half doesnt change
 BenjaminUrquhart: my opponent detection is genius: if I don't see it, it doesn't exist
 JBM: how nihilistic
 muy31: that's most of our detection though
 Neoncamouflage: If you don't see it, it probably doesn't see you. So you're at least on equal terms
 avdg: what if tp were added
 Durkin: we must all be genius, muy
 muy31: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: says the guy wiht camo in his name
 BenjaminUrquhart: with*
 njaber: But if he's been tracking you you'll get into problems
 Neoncamouflage: My pacs still struggle to track a pellet 2 spaces away from them. They've already got problems. XD
 njaber: I just want to finish my thing so I can surprise jumpa all your defensless pacs
 muy31: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99725738-e2b2-40ed-9c12-8dcd15edb658">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99725738-e2b2-40ed-9c12-8dcd15edb658</a>
 muy31: what's with this error?
 icecream17: couterbalnce is only a few ranks above me but always wins
 icecream17: hmm. i forgot many because i didn't work on it much yesterday, so i should track opponent then
 Neoncamouflage: I'm waiting to see a couple days from now when people have pacs planning ambushes
 BenjaminUrquhart: .
 BenjaminUrquhart: chat relay died, cool
 avdg: as long as pallets have more value...
 njaber: I don't know if I was the only one having the problem
 avdg: unless someone invented fun
 njaber: I do'nt even see which of my messages got through
 BenjaminUrquhart: chat is dying
 njaber: Did my "chat is ded" message make it through?
 njaber: I don't see it
 Moonik: i don't see it either
 Moonik: hello btw
 Moonik: i'm new here
 muy31: my issue right now is when i am in speed i cant go to anywhere less than two spaces away
 muy31: which is annoying
 cegprakash: I just added depth=3
 cegprakash: :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: cegprakash why so low on the leaderboard
 cegprakash: leaderboard not updated yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: you submit?
 cegprakash: I am yet to add pellets tracking and exploration
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 icecream17: ceg i havent either
 cegprakash: was just trying higher depth to check my simulations count
 icecream17: simulation? when your stream was said to be unuseful for pros....
 BenjaminUrquhart: muy31 your pacs go back and forth a bit <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460809222">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460809222</a>
 cegprakash: I never said unuseful
 BenjaminUrquhart: that was a submit battle btw
 cegprakash: may be I should try depth=5 for speed to be effective
 struct: what search are you using?
 struct: randoM?
 cegprakash: yes
 struct: how many turns simullated?
 cegprakash: submitted bot is depth = 3
 Doju: holy sht
 Doju: i just troubleshooted a bug for like 2 hours on a discord call with my brother
 Doju: who's been studying computer science a bit
 Doju: apparently it's not a good idea to make custom iterating functions after all
 Kellthazar: You are a problem solver Doju. XD
 cegprakash: I need to add bonus score for capturing pellets at turn 1 though
 cegprakash: :D
 Doju: wanna hear what the bug was?
 Tyir: of course; let us learn from your misfortune 
 JBM: or his
 Kellthazar: Sure...
 JBM: not sure yet
 avdg: I had a bug where I set a value to a fixed value before comparing it
 Doju: So, in my grid class i had a custom iterating thing which let me iterate through the array like this:
 Doju: for cell in grid
 Doju: without needing to type this:
 Doju: for row in grid:
 Doju: the iterating function's iteration was tied to a value in the instance
 Doju: called self.iterator
 Doju: now when iterated for each cell in each cell
 Doju: the iterator value got set to 0 in the middle of the outer loop
 JBM: that's horrible
 JBM: i hereby revoke your licence to code
 Kellthazar: The things we done just for avoid to write one more for loop
 icecream17: i thought for loop are amazing
 icecream17: so much less debug than while
 Doju: for loops are not the issue
 Doju: but custom iterations are
 JBM: still so much more than no loop
 JBM: custom iterations are fine
 Doju: err
 JBM: they just shouldn't share state with the iteratee
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: hmm
 Doju: maybe you could remedy that with like self.iteration_index or something like that
 Doju: but that'd get messy real fast
 JBM: no no no
 JBM: your iterator should be external
 Doju: huh?
 Doju: soo.. where do i store it
 JBM: somewhere between "nowhere" and "where you use it"
 icecream17: uh-oh. i put too many "errors" for debugging and the error stream doesn't show all the errors. what do i do?
 JBM: log more stuff
 BenjaminUrquhart: print less stuff
 JBM: until you find out what's logging so much
 struct: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: have less errors
 icecream17: js doesn't have i/o really. so they made "console.error" for debug and "console.log" to output
 JBM: errr... don't use js then?
 njaber: Make a custom class that delays log to other turn X)
 njaber: I hate auto emojies
 icecream17: only language i know. except for a bit of python. and object oriented is hard to do, sint flexible
 BenjaminUrquhart: but that's the point of oop I though
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 JBM: oo in js istn't what i'd call "typical"
 solaimanope: when will bronze league boss appear?
 JBM: in 16:15
 solaimanope: GMT?
 JBM: from now
 SemChumboPT: Good luck Everyone&#160;!
 JBM: "in"
 solaimanope: uh ok
 solaimanope: thanks
 JBM: around 1600UTC
 RockyMullet: hum, wanted to know what is the best move to do in a certain seed so test agaisnt Illedan, but then I won... I wanted to learn&#160;! :rage:
 BenjaminUrquhart: test against me, you'll win too
 struct: Rocky I think its a bit harder to fight C# now
 struct: arena code is on release mode
 struct: ide on debug
 CodingCarter: i feel like some of the questions on this game are too easy.  Like, if it gives you the for loop and you only have to add a number squared to a total and print out the total, it's too easy!
 BenjaminUrquhart: something something euler has anti-debug
 RockyMullet: BenjaminUrquhart I did win too lol
 struct: he doesnt have it anymore
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 RockyMullet: but I still learned something from Illedan, he started stronger and thats what im tryting to improve, my initial gathering
 icecream17: should I start immediately with speed?
 RockyMullet: struct what you mean about C#&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: go for it
 struct: C# was updated on C#
 JBM: wat
 struct: its now on release mode on arena
 RockyMullet: icecream17 yeah, if you handle moving twice, 99% of the time, speed o cd is the way
 struct: but if you fight on IDE it isnt on release
 RockyMullet: weird, why would they do that
 struct: its same for rust
 RockyMullet: seems more important to be on release in the arena
 struct: its on releae on arena
 struct: but on ide isnt
 RockyMullet: oh, probably to have better errors
 struct: yeah
 RockyMullet: anyway I'm doing this with C++
 Kellthazar: 500 loc after some cleanup
 Doju: oh
 Doju: welll
 Doju: I just figure out i could do the same thing with this
 Doju:   for iterator in range(self.width*self.height)
 Doju: the more you know
 RockyMullet: my spagetthi monster has 2.6k lines of code now
 Doju: dude what
 RockyMullet: I just smash my face on my keyboard
 RockyMullet: and magic happens
 RockyMullet: tbh I need to refactoring my gathering, A LOT of copy paster involved in there
 RockyMullet: I need to know how to write too, god, haha
 Tyir: RockyMullet copy paste gets you wins
 RockyMullet: yes&#160;!
 RockyMullet: it's just a bit chaotic
 seronis: newb here.   won a little over half of my battles when i submitted but my rank still 2700s / 2800 in bronze.   Whats the criteria if not win percentage&#160;?
 RockyMullet: depends on who you win against
 RockyMullet: winning against bad bots doesnt help much
 Tyir: first 10 battles are various ranks; and gives you an average ranking to get started in
 Doju: RockyMullet " a bit"
 Doju: i can't comprehend what's going on in my 499 lines
 Doju: and you have 5 times as many haha
 seronis: im honestly surprised my 120 lines did ANYTHING
 Doju: i think you can get a basic bfs in 120 lines
 Doju: or at least just closest by manhattan distance eeasily
 Doju: that'll do you quite a bit
 seronis: yeah i do a flood fill search so it grabs closest
 Doju: wait... why do i have so many damn lines lmao
 Doju: my code does nothing special
 Doju: pretty much only bfs
 njaber: I'm closing in on 1000
 Tyir: i have no search&#160;:(
 SemChumboPT: me neither
 Tyir: i just pick a neighbor with a pellet; otherwise i use the default move towards the closest Manhattan distance pellet (no path finding, so it isn't 100% accurate)
 BenWo: Doju you've been here chatting every time I've checked the last 2 days
 Doju: BenWo i've been here coding every time i've checked in the last 2 days
 Doju: seriously i've put like a solid 40 hours into this bot
 Doju: however 40 hours only goes so far if you've only been coding for a few months
 Doju: but anyways i reeeally need to go to bed
 Tyir: i have some things i want to attempt; if you have a BFS i can give you some tricks to implement&#160;:)
 Doju: maybe i'll come up with some neat optimizations to my precalc :p
 Doju: umm
 Doju: I seriously need to go but i'd like to hear your tricks so maybe later? 
 Tyir: k; im too lazy to implement them so i wanted someone else who already has a search algorithm to test for me 
 Doju: alright cya
 njaber: I already have a Bfs, and I'm curious of what you're thinking, but I'm working on a big algorithm for my bot rn so I probably wouldn't test it for you unless it's really interesting
 icecream17: why is my path function doing [ '26 5', '25 5', '27 5', '26 4', '26 6' ] i dont undertstand....
 BenWo: hah, 'nite Doju&#160;:)
 njaber: gn
 seronis: icecream17,  looks like a starting coordinate which then had its 4 neighbors added.  thats how i do my floodfill
 seronis: whats your problem with that&#160;?
 RockyMullet: 1000 ms is plenty of time to do a bfs from all positions to all positions
 ongietorri: hi
 ongietorri: can someone explain how we are supposed to use the SPEED ability&#160;?
 ongietorri: when i use it on startup it seems if fails everytime
 BenWo: "SPEED id"
 BenWo: that's the only command you can send for that id on that turn
 ongietorri: I can't send a move on the same turn&#160;?
 BenWo: nope
 BenjaminUrquhart: for that pac at least
 ongietorri: ok, thank you
 jke: anyone know if enemy pacs block vision?
 ongietorri: i will try that&#160;!
 BenjaminUrquhart: they do not jke
 TheOnlyJoker: Idk why whenever I use speed the pacman keep stoping

 BenWo: what's with the huge link?
 TheOnlyJoker: my bad xD
 BenWo: :thumbsup:
 BenWo: just from watching, it looks like you're not giving them a new move command once they reach their destination?
 TheOnlyJoker: no I do
 TheOnlyJoker: when I dont use the speed everything goes good
 BenWo: frame 7
 BenWo: you're sending speed before the cooldown is over
 BenWo: frame 7-11 are just speed commands
 BenWo: cooldown is 10 turns, speed only lasts 5 turns
 BenWo: it looks like your MOVE commands are also only targeting 1 cell away, so you're not actually getting any benefit from speed
 cegprakash: wow changed my  scoring function to double and it's performing lot better
 BenjaminUrquhart: what happened to waffle
 BenjaminUrquhart: he dropped a lot
 BenjaminUrquhart: cegprakash submit when
 cegprakash: just did
 TheOnlyJoker: tnx problem fixed
 BenjaminUrquhart: still not top 1000
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 BenWo: np
 cegprakash: just 10 games processed
 cegprakash: wait for it BenjaminUrquhart
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: no speed?
 BenjaminUrquhart: also, this is some quality action<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460836923">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460836923</a>
 cegprakash: i removed depth
 cegprakash: for now
 SemChumboPT: ah ah I was only updating what i hate and i was behind the pellets the oponent already eaten&#160;!!
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice
 cegprakash: adding depth I am doing some zig zag as I'm not giving bonus score for taking the pellet now
 cegprakash: like me it's lazy and decides to take the pellets in later turns when I add depth
 cegprakash: I get 150K sims with depth = 1
 cegprakash: :D
 BenWo: lol nice replay
 Kellthazar: Implemented a defensive move...
 Kellthazar: if enemey cd === 0 and dist === 1, change to type who can beat my pac (counter-play to the enemy attempt to kill my pac).
 Kellthazar: Interesting that this strategy can fail for more simpliest AI...
 BenWo: sneaky
 Kellthazar: Submitted... drop from ~ 300 to 400. Though still battling.
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460837530">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460837530</a>
 Kellthazar: pacs 3 blue and 2 red
 BenWo: what do you mean 3 blue / 2 red?
 cegprakash: bugs bugs everywhere lmao
 muy31: kellthazar i wouldn't assume enemies would attack you unless they can already beat you
 muy31: i wonder the dynamic here? turn 31-32 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460845826">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460845826</a>
 BenWo: I think I get it
 BenWo: the 2 blue pacs both use speed
 BenWo: so they're trying to move 2 squares, but collide on the first square move attempt
 BenWo: then the non-speed red pac attempts to move and nothing else is currently moving into that square
 muy31: yeah its kind of lucky, plus i didnt see the scissor pac
 muy31: cause it was around the corner
 Kellthazar: BenWo is right
 BenWo: sure, tricky
 BenWo: I'm not sure I understand frame 33, lol
 BenWo: must be that blue pacs are colliding and red pacs are colliding
 muy31: yeah lol
 BenWo: there are definitely opportunities for insane tactics if your pacs cooperate
 BenWo: actually, I'm not sure that whole situation would have played out like that if your paper Pac was a scissors instead
 muy31: no it wouldn't have mattered
 BenWo: since it was paper it had the potential to overlap with both the blue scissors or rock
 muy31: nothing ever collided with the paper pac
 Kellthazar: muy32, in that game I shared, the red pack ID 2 (SCISSORS) could kill the blue pac id 3 (PAPER), but changed anyways to counter-play the enemy move
 SemChumboPT:  The enemy can do the same...
 cegprakash: Only pacs with the SPEED ability enabled can move:cegprakash:
 cegprakash: why do I get this in log
 cegprakash: plz help
 SemChumboPT: you have to store that "behavior" for future encounters
 Kellthazar: cegprakash, with speed enabled, they are a 
 Kellthazar: hidden turn
 muy31: no kovi did the right thing, but your counterplay was the wrong one
 BenWo: cegprakash: that's just letting you know that the following turn information is the extra move speed Pacs get
 cegprakash: wait what
 cegprakash: I spent 2 days on this.. I didn't know I'll get 2 turns
 muy31: if you are going to be defeated, then counterplay
 muy31: else kellthazar don't
 cegprakash: so I read input twice in same turn?
 BenWo: you don't actually get 2 turns
 cegprakash: if I'm speeded up
 BenWo: it just executes 2 turns
 muy31: or kellthazar counterplay to beat the opponent
 cegprakash: should I read input twice?
 BenWo: so you need to tell your pacs to move 2 spaces to take advantage of the speed
 cegprakash: in a speed turn
 Kellthazar: This hidden turn is out of the player AI control
 BenWo: no, the input isn't doubled
 Kellthazar: It just to compute the new position for speed-up pacs
 Kellthazar: Thinks as a slow motion
 Kellthazar: muy31, Ill try to not do nothing
 Kellthazar: Against the majority of cases, will be result on my death
 Kellthazar: the pacs death XD
 errata: which compiler and framework for C# is being used in the contest?
 cegprakash: okay it's just a log
 cegprakash: it scares me
 cegprakash: I thought it's an error or something
 muy31: kellthazar im trying to make a point here: see turn 32 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460851584">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460851584</a>
 muy31: you win b/c you did nothing
 muy31: whether intentional or not
 muy31: i lost b/c i haven't developed my speed computation yet
 BenWo: errata -&gt; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 muy31: in this case, however, kellthazar (literally the next run) on turn 54
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460852662">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460852662</a>
 errata: @BenWo thanks! 
 BenWo: np
 muy31: here you should have counterplayed kell
 Kellthazar: muy31, in turn 32 I did a movement 
 Kellthazar: I saw your pack, as paper with cooldown, so I change my pac to SCISSORS e send to your pac position
 SemChumboPT: damm my bot is too bad..without algos this is dificult&#160;:)
 BenWo: this is tough, but fun&#160;:)
 muy31: rip i didnt see that ok Kellthazar you win
 BenWo: rewriting my map data object
 Kellthazar: turn 54, muy31, my bot made a bad decision
 muy31: but Kellthazar if you would win a tradeoff, why would you switch to what would make you tie?
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 muy31: im just saying, switch if you are going to lose, and switch to beat your opponent if you are going to win
 Kellthazar: I made a correction now: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460855575">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460855575</a>
 Kellthazar: my bot has a ROCK type and enemy SCISSORS type, both are cooldown equals zero.
 Kellthazar: when the distance is equal ONE, I changed my type to the enemy' s type, to, at least make a TIE
 cegprakash: or just run Kellthazar
 cegprakash: :D
 Kellthazar: Why not try to eat it?
 cegprakash: sim that has full of bugs: rank 1100 :D sim fixed those huge  bug&#160;: 998 rank
 cegprakash: looks like heuristics dominating
 Kellthazar: 308 right now
 Kellthazar: Need to make my pacs more sparse on the board.
 Kellthazar: I think that will be a great improvement to my algo
 SemChumboPT: Every time I think I "improve" something I go down on table!!
 Neoncamouflage: Glad I'm not the only one
 Neoncamouflage: I finally broke 1k and I'm terrified to submit again
 SemChumboPT: Bronze League here I go&#160;!!
 BenWo: :smile::thumbsup:
 Kellthazar: Hahahaha
 BenjaminUrquhart: cegprakash I'm averaging #100 pure heuristics
 Kellthazar: Nice...
 berries: how long is peoples code
 berries: i cant get mine running and i dont know if its too complicated and i need to make it more simple or if im missing stuff
 ChrisOz: C# - 500 lines of ode
 njaber: C# 1000 lines
 SemChumboPT: Mine -&gt; PHP (160 Lines)
 SemChumboPT: many of them coments
 BenWo: Python - 350 and rapidly growing
 njaber: And you're probably missing stuff, unless your code is slow complexity isn't a reason it wwouldn't work, it would make it harder to debug though
 berries: yeah im getting weird errors 
 berries: and i dont understand whats making them errors
 BenWo: what language?
 berries: java
 BenWo: what's the error?
 berries: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/292e1702-b2b0-418e-837f-7ed9d540085b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/292e1702-b2b0-418e-837f-7ed9d540085b</a>
 NapTown: your list is empty
 berries: oh okay ill take another look at it, thanks
 Kellthazar: drop 200 positions after the last submit. XD
 BenWo: sounds like you fixed it, lol
 SemChumboPT: Keelthazar you improved.. just slower than your oponents
 SemChumboPT: I like to think that way&#160;!!
 njaber: Not it just takes time for your rank to update when you resubmit and when you have few battles your rank is lowered a lot, thsi has nothing to do with the actuall Quality of his bot
 njaber: Gosh I'm so bad at typing
 berries: yeah i have no idea why it's empty, it shouldnt be
 BenjaminUrquhart: berries 758 java
 BenjaminUrquhart: not like that matters
 berries: yeah i dont think its how much, i barely have an algorithm right now i just want to get a bot that will eat a single damn pellet
 Kellthazar: MOVE 0 pellet.x pellet.y
 Kellthazar: Stonks
 Neoncamouflage: Brilliant!
 Neoncamouflage: Give that man a raise
 berries: okay im an idiot and forgot to put the method i made to add the edges, in the actual main. but now im just timing out
 njaber: then you method or a code situated after your previous error probably has an infinite loop somwhere
 Kellthazar: berries are you doing some kind of distance calculation?
 Jesus_inn_party: SUp EvveryBoDeeeeeeeeeee!

 the_joker_100: sup?
 BenjaminUrquhart: sky
 the_joker_100: what u outside?
 the_joker_100: its ceilingfor me?
 the_joker_100: did u see the replay i shared last night?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 the_joker_100: my bot somehow beat urs man im at 1,190
 BenjaminUrquhart: mine isn't all that great ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's so dumb it outdumbs the smart bots
 the_joker_100: lmao
 the_joker_100: but u at 100&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I was top 10 for a short amount of time
 BenjaminUrquhart: so like
 BenjaminUrquhart: I just haven't bothered to really change the way my bot works and everyone else has
 the_joker_100: i am rewriting everything i landed at 700 with the previous bot
 the_joker_100: and it waas just a mess
 Jesus_inn_party: guys the next league will be unlocked soon
 Jesus_inn_party: i am changing mine too
 BenjaminUrquhart: it opens at the same time my AP exams stars
 BenjaminUrquhart: start*
 Jesus_inn_party: what time is it in  your counttry
 the_joker_100: damn it opens today?
 Jesus_inn_party: yeap in one hour
 the_joker_100: omg
 Jesus_inn_party: i guess
 the_joker_100: might pull my previous bot out just o get in silve rleague
 Jesus_inn_party: the dude said 5 uk time
 Jesus_inn_party: havent you beat the bot yet
 the_joker_100: which bot?
 Jesus_inn_party: although not so sure i have but 
 Jesus_inn_party: the bot that your suppose to beat to be able to go to the next league
 the_joker_100: which one tho??name?
 Jesus_inn_party: or not
 Jesus_inn_party: i think iam wrong 
 the_joker_100: the bot might not b out yet
 Jesus_inn_party: idk what the hell i am talking about
 Donotalo: Should a DFS examining 8^5 states timeout 50ms on CG server?
 Kellthazar: Did you test locally?
 Donotalo: yes, testing for optimization
 Donotalo: but wondering, should 8^5 states timeout or is it my code that's bad
 Donotalo: i thought 10^6 states should easily pass 50 ms on CG server, am I wrong?
 BenjaminUrquhart: cg servers are pretty good, but since it's contest time they might be a bit slower
 Jesus_inn_party: why are some people 24hr online
 the_joker_100: no idea man
 the_joker_100: i just woke up
 Jesus_inn_party: me too
 Jesus_inn_party: :fist:
 the_joker_100: i cant do stuffs if no sleep
 Jesus_inn_party: yeap fell yo
 Jesus_inn_party: *feel
 the_joker_100: @BenjaminUrqhart how do u deal with speed blindness??
 the_joker_100: my bots just go crazy if i use speed??
 the_joker_100: anyone got anyidea?
 BenjaminUrquhart: the_joker_100 my bot just doesn't care I guess idk
 the_joker_100: lmao
 the_joker_100: u got to have something right??
 the_joker_100: i mean u dont get 93rd just goin randomly?or do u?
 the_joker_100: hmmmmmmmmmm
 fasil: hy
 the_joker_100: just submitted my bot.....
 the_joker_100: hopei get into 1000s
 BenjaminUrquhart: "u dont get 93rd just goin randomly"
 the_joker_100: kk but how do the bots go in such perfect positions even when usin speed??
 the_joker_100: coz if i use speed my bots just go to the worst possible directions
 BenjaminUrquhart: magic
 the_joker_100: lmao
 the_joker_100: kk
 BenjaminUrquhart: no it just kind of happened :P
 the_joker_100: happy accidents?
 BenjaminUrquhart: 99% of this bot I threw together in wood 2 in order to promote
 the_joker_100: i got to 889 by just searching for food
 Neoncamouflage: I couldn't get past 1800 just looking for food
 Neoncamouflage: Turned them all into hunter/killer pacs and that got me close to 1k. Now I'm trying to find a balance
 the_joker_100: i did the same last time
 the_joker_100: and it was a chaos

 Neoncamouflage: How do you test against a specific person's bot?
 Neoncamouflage: Just hope they show up in your recent battles?
 the_joker_100: u delete the thing on players tab
 the_joker_100: and add from leaderboard
 BenjaminUrquhart: default ai sucks
 the_joker_100: yeah
 the_joker_100: u can win it if u just move to some square
 MHavlovick: I assume pellets are visible where the tunnel wraps around to the other side? So, if there is no wall to  the left of my pac, the pellets where the pac will come out the right side are visible until there is a wall?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: you can see across the wrap
 MHavlovick: Thanks

 VicHofs: ok basically I'm trying to avoid timeouts by running algorithms only up to a set amount of time @thethiny
 VicHofs: i.e. timing a while loop and breaking after an elapsed timme t
 VicHofs: *time
 Icebox: so you DO want to measure bot time while in-game... :upside_down:
 VicHofs: what
 VicHofs: then I didn't get -your- question either lol
 VicHofs: I want to time code runtime
 Icebox: you want to measure elapsed time while your bot is in a battle
 VicHofs: that's about it
 Icebox: yeah
 Icebox: then forget what I said
 Icebox: profilers are for debugging purposes
 Icebox: basically if you want to optimize some piece of code and what to find out how is the 50ms divided across the parts of your code
 VicHofs: yeah I was reading through the docs just to be sure and couldn't find really anything that fits
 Icebox: that's what a profiler would do
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d04ce1e4-9950-408c-8e95-5ec94e75401c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d04ce1e4-9950-408c-8e95-5ec94e75401c</a>
 Icebox: for measuring runtime in-game
 thethiny: here you go
 Icebox: just go for time.time()
 thethiny: then
 VicHofs: I might just try that when debugging other code tho so thanks anyway @Icebox
 thethiny: Profiler.submit(profile_fn, timeout)
 VicHofs: wait that looks like something that raises a flag after a timeout tho
 thethiny: yes
 VicHofs: is that correct @thethiny?
 thethiny: you can just check the flag in your functions
 thethiny: or just submit your function to an executor with a timeout
 thethiny: if it times out just catch it
 VicHofs: ty I'll try that
 BenjaminUrquhart: chat crash in 7 minutes
 thethiny:&#160;:(
 thethiny: when will it come back
 BenjaminUrquhart: some time
 eulerscheZahl: that's the final countdown
 thethiny: @eulershceZahl write me a bot so I can submit it
 thethiny: @eulerscheZahl *
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still busy writing my own bot
 VicHofs: I'll take five @eulerscheZahl
 thethiny: yeah but it doesn't work that way
 thethiny: others come first
 eulerscheZahl: i have to extract more information, damn fog
 thethiny: hahaha
 VicHofs: fog?
 VicHofs: you mean the FOV?
 BenjaminUrquhart: 4 minutes
 VicHofs: LOS
 thethiny: FOG
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, line of sight, fog of war
 thethiny: it means inability to see others
 BenjaminUrquhart: we are blinded by fear
 VicHofs: yeah I just figured you would've dealt with that by now @eulerscheZahl lol
 eulerscheZahl: partially
 VicHofs: what are you having trouble with
 eulerscheZahl: i remember when i saw a cell earlier and there was no pellet
 BenjaminUrquhart: same
 VicHofs: wym
 eulerscheZahl: but tracking the opponent location is a nightmare
 VicHofs: How would you even track it tho
 thethiny: that's super easy, barely an inconvenience.
 VicHofs: prediction?
 BenjaminUrquhart: public void resolvePelletDiscrepencies() {...}
 thethiny: the opponent is always on the grid
 thethiny: pfffffft
 ZarthaxX: are you really trying to track him toad
 eulerscheZahl: if i see the opponent twice with a few turns between, i try to find possible paths and remove pellets along the way
 o_imej: any ideas about how to calculate distance&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but there is more information hiding:
 BenjaminUrquhart: 1 minute
 thethiny: abs(x-x2) + abs(y-y2)
 VicHofs: damn you're far off lol @eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461308137">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461308137</a>
 VicHofs: try manhattan distance @o_imej
 eulerscheZahl: check the red stone at the top right
 o_imej: thetiny i don't think tha's would work 
 eulerscheZahl: opponent gains 0 points in the first turn, then 10 at once
 eulerscheZahl:  =&gt; speeding
 BenjaminUrquhart: ABANDON HOPE, WE ARE LOST
 thethiny: You said red stone and I assumed minecraft
 eulerscheZahl: if i detect that, it's a save kill, 2 vs 1
 ChooJeremy: You don't see point gain though so you wouldn't even know they gain 10 points
 BenjaminUrquhart: bye guys
 VicHofs: did someone say redstone
 eulerscheZahl: and i already have the killing feature but only when i see the opponent
 o_imej: there's obstacles between two points which means the formula won't work all the time 
 thethiny: do you have the ability to see score?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 thethiny: how?
 VicHofs: o_imej what you're looking for is probably an algorithm then
 thethiny: wb y'all
 VicHofs: try BFS
 Gonny: that was underwhelming
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh cool it restarted
 thethiny: exactly
 VicHofs: @thethiny it's in the input
 thethiny: In Bronze?
 VicHofs: first line, format:-your score-  -opponent score-
 VicHofs: yes @thethiny
 thethiny: oh my god I never noticed
 thethiny: WHAT A BIG GOOD
 thethiny: GOOF*
 VicHofs: I'm in bronze too
 VicHofs: yeah idk what you plan on doing with that tho lmao
 thethiny: if my score is &lt; his score I just eat next pellet
 thethiny: else I go to big pellet
 thethiny: also if is score is double mine then I can assume he's speeding
 VicHofs: idk I'm going big pellet as a priority lmao
 VicHofs: gee
 VicHofs: I can't take this y'all smart
 thethiny: I said I can assume he's speeding but I'm not gonna do anything with that info lol
 VicHofs: sweet
 VicHofs: hey um quick question
 thethiny: yes?
 VicHofs: I've been thinking about this but I thought it wasn't worth asking
 VicHofs: @everyone
 VicHofs: can you use machine learning in this biz
 ChooJeremy: I don't see why not if you wanted to
 VicHofs: I mean
 BobLaserShark: You can always use ml. The question is should you?
 VicHofs: wouldn't anyone just win hard with a well trained rcnn
 BobLaserShark: Maybe. The main thing with training a nn though is getting training data
 thethiny: I think if you do it locally then absolutely
 thethiny: but you won't do it as rnn
 thethiny: ml*
 VicHofs: idk tho I've never done it for a game
 thethiny: you'll do it as RL
 thethiny: DQN Agent 
 VicHofs: yes but u can do RL with an NN
 thethiny: I think it was called 3 Star or something like that
 VicHofs: yep
 thethiny: 3CA DQN
 BobLaserShark: neat might also be worth looking at
 VicHofs: yeah ik
 eulerscheZahl: it's back already :o
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: just in time for you to write me a bot
 VicHofs: I mean you could see all the pacs' locations with a nice RL model
 VicHofs: plus track them using an RCNN info feed
 VicHofs: I'm not crazy enough to try but if anyone wanted some ideas lol
 ChooJeremy: By RCNN you mean interpreting the game's UI screen (that we see) to find pacs?
 VicHofs: yes
 ChooJeremy: cause I'm pretty sure your code won't be able to get that info
 VicHofs: well I mean a pre-trained one
 VicHofs: yeah that's what I was thinking
 VicHofs: dependencies tank hard in challenges like this
 BobLaserShark: I've done live analysis of a UI before for AI. It's less than ideal
 VicHofs: but if you managed to do it locally it would be pretty sweet
 BobLaserShark: Are you able to use locally run code to control?
 ChooJeremy: Yeah if you do it locally I think the only thing you can do really is run your neural network against it
 ChooJeremy: Would probably kill your learning if you feed it screen information first but can't give it that same information during the actual thing
 VicHofs: @BobLaserShark I've never done it for a game before so I'll just take your word for it
 thethiny: my bot is 811 lines of code yet without including switching and speeding
 thethiny: what have I done
 VicHofs: @ChooJeremy ye probs
 BobLaserShark: 811 lines?
 VicHofs: @thethiny probably a better job than me
 BobLaserShark: Not bad
 VicHofs: I'm at 157
 eulerscheZahl: 1027 lines of madness
 thethiny: It should be more than 800???
 Ken_Fool: did the bronze bot got better? havent played in 2 days but now it is adapting its type, was sure it wasnt before?
 VicHofs: yes Ken_Fool
 Ken_Fool: ouch
 VicHofs: Inky exists now
 ChooJeremy: 555, including speeding but it's "if cooldown == 0 speed"
 VicHofs: y'all crazy bruh
 BobLaserShark: What you have to do is use a genetic algorithm to generate the code to solve the challenge&#160;:)
 VicHofs: don't
 BobLaserShark: thousands and thousands of line :smile:
 VicHofs: stop this is giving me anxiety.
 BobLaserShark: Run it on a super computing cluster.
 thethiny: SethBling wrote an GA that works in Lua using 400 lines that plays Mario World 2
 thethiny: you don't need thousands of lines
 BobLaserShark: The GA isn't made by the code, it makes the code
 thethiny:&#160;?????????????????
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's not ho it works
 BenjaminUrquhart: how*
 BobLaserShark: Have a GA generate potential code solutions and evaluate it
 thethiny: oh no that's not what GA does
 thethiny: you need code, GA generates Solution
 thethiny: not code
 BobLaserShark: I'm smashing a fly with a mallet here&#160;:)
 thethiny: Smashing some bugs, ey?
 BobLaserShark: There's technically nothing keeping a GA from generating code. It all depends on what the output vectors are. 
 thethiny: you can do that but to write lines of code you need a huge tensor
 thethiny: really huge
 thethiny: we're talking about a thousand line
 thethiny: each line has n characters
 thethiny: the model would weigh in GBs, and inference will be in seconds
 BobLaserShark: I have access to a supercomputer. This is all feasible, though I believe strict tensors would not be the most optimal way of generating the data
 BenjaminUrquhart: use a ga to generate the next challenge
 thethiny: 😂
 BenjaminUrquhart: totally feasible /s
 Kellthazar: Is it possible to run the java/kotlin class of your Bot AI directily on the gameSimulator?
 Kellthazar: I tried but my code get stuck on the Scanner(System.in) input call
 BobLaserShark: Neural net's input for the next challange:
 BobLaserShark: Neural net's input for the next challenge:
 BobLaserShark: "The next codingame challenge should be based on a semi-related exercise. There are a couple exercises from previous codemeet challenges. I will accept a few more if I have the time to implement them, I'm sure many people have them already.
 BobLaserShark: Sounds like we're writing an interpreter :rofl:
 Ken_Fool: wow i accidently discovered multiline cursor in vs this challenge already has been worth for me XD
 berries: is anybodies bot timing out randomly for no reason?
 Ken_Fool: mine did in the beginning but not anymore, for me it had something to do with others speeding and me not
 Ken_Fool: does it time out at the same point&#160;?
 Doju: matriculation exam results coming in in a minute&#160;:(
 Doju: wrong smiley fac
 Doju: D:
 Ken_Fool: gl
 jrke: All the best
 berries: nah im in wood 2 lmao
 berries: i just got the code working and it wasnt timing out 
 berries: but now it does it randomly 
 thethiny: I'm giving out on my bot
 thethiny: It refuses to move
 thethiny: 😞
 seronis: berries any possibility you are failing to queue an order&#160;?
 berries: what do you mean by that
 berries: like output a move 
 berries: it shouldnt be 
 seronis: like NOT outputting a move
 seronis: and going back to the next input
 berries: it should be outputting it 
 berries: but idk ill check in the morning 
 thibpat: :sparkles: Spring Challenge time :sparkles: I'm streaming some coding to climb the silver league :rocket:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 aCat: youre not already in silver?
 aCat: oh you mean climb inside
 aCat: silly cat
 Uljahn: im waiting for Icebox's stream&#160;:/
 aCat: or euler's :D
 aCat: unshaved ;p
 Icebox: Uljahn I'm running into real life problems .-.
 aCat:&#160;:/ sorry to hear that
 Icebox: and I also don't feel like I'm performing well this contest so idk if stream would even be educational enough .-.
 Uljahn: np
 Icebox: but I'll see how it looks once gold opens
 Icebox: maybe I'll get my shit together till then ^^
 thethiny: good luck Icebox
 Doju: this feels so stupid
 Doju: so as not to loop over every cell if they don't need a reset
 Doju: i first get a known path cell in the init method and check if that needs a reset before doing all of them
 Doju: Does that sound reasonable to you?
 Uljahn: are you talking with Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: so they are pretty much the same as if i had the same problem
 Doju: just shouting my question into the void and hoping that someone responds Uljahn
 Doju: At least i know that Automaton2000 is always ready to respond
 Automaton2000: and it's not the only one
 Zandy156: Every time I send a loss to my ide I don't lose. How am I supposed to debug like this?
 tekki: lol no luck Zandy156
 MichaelVonWolfen: How many people got in Silver?
 aCat: 566
 ionutzxy: silly question: how can I chat privately with one person?
 Doju: click on their anem
 Doju: name
 ionutzxy: and then?
 Doju: then just chat?
 Doju: it should open a private chat
 ionutzxy: it doesn't open anything
 Doju: that's odd
 Doju: can't you see the private chat that i started with you?
 ionutzxy: yes
 ionutzxy: maybe one user can restrict the chat?
 Doju: if you click on someone else?
 thethiny: you can PM someone as a private chat
 ionutzxy: no, is frustrating
 Doju: thethiny I swear your little profile picture had eyes when i last saw it
 Doju: have you changed it?
 thethiny: hahahahahaah
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: good noticing 😂
 Doju: :D
 thethiny: I changed it to an illustration
 Doju: ahh i think i found the reason for my bot not being deterministic
 Doju: i'm storing some cells as a set
 Doju: and they
 Doju: dont have order
 thethiny: I had a similar issue for why my bot wasn't moving according to me
 thethiny: I forgot to check if is_mine :D
 thethiny: so I was moving enemy
 Doju: :D
 thethiny: imagine if we could move enemy lol
 lifetimeLearner007: that's the problem  with set
 thethiny: in python sets are ordered
 thethiny: but that's in 3.8
 Doju: i dont think it's a problem lifetimeLearner007
 Doju: or at least not in this implementation
 Doju: in fact it might actually be better if my bot is not deterministic so you can't predict it
 Doju: but all the outcomes are still of equal value
 lifetimeLearner007: maybe revisit the scoring logic?
 Doju: i don't have any lmao
 Doju: except for the distance
 avdg: fixed the scoring logic yesterday
 avdg: but I have to merge my searches because my ai does more than 1
 Doju: what do people even mean by search?
 thethiny: guys I made inifinite loop recursion
 Doju: like simulations?
 thethiny: I just saw an error I never saw before
 thethiny: Unknown error (stacktrace too big)
 avdg: looking up in grids
 thethiny: that's what she said
 thethiny: that's what she also said
 Doju: i mean i look up the closest pellet in the grid avdg
 avdg: you gotta love recursion&#160;;-)
 Doju: is that a search
 thethiny: ikr
 avdg: yes
 thethiny: @Doju everything is anything if you believe hard enough :D
 avdg: read and compare is a search
 lifetimeLearner007: i thought best action from simulation is search
 avdg: but I need to change my system to get more umph (perf) and have more accurate results
 avdg: lifetime: it's mostly pruning that you need to do to get the best result
 avdg: but that the is a combination of operations that depends on the task
 Doju: I kinda wanna flood fill the whole grid on every move
 Doju: might be possible with symmetry and all the other optimizations
 avdg: I think I have to do that for every pac I have given my current system
 Doju: what?!
 avdg: and I think I am already close to doing that or maybe more every turn
 Doju: why every pac?
 avdg: location
 Doju: oh sorry
 Doju: i mean getting the dist from every cell to every other cell
 avdg: already using flat arrays for everything
 Doju: flat arrays are nasty :P
 avdg: ah, dist is mostly manhatten and bfs (or a* but I don't use)
 Doju: MANHATTAN?!
 Doju: if you have bfs and a* why don't you use them?
 avdg: I use bfs
 Doju: okay then why are you using manhattan at all?
 avdg: few things
 avdg: to determine state of my pac
 avdg: but sometimes the bfs is already done then
 avdg: or isn't related at all to pathing
 thethiny: I also swapped my BFS and A* for manhattan
 avdg: if distance is max 2, path is deterministic anyway
 Doju: alright
 Doju: i just made a distance lookup system  using precalc
 Doju: so everything is perfect and fast
 thethiny: can you explain
 Doju: during the first move (and possibly in the future during every move to account for moving pacs) i calculate the distance from every cell to every other cell
 Doju: then i just look that distance up whenever i need to access it
 Tiramon: ok in theory i just created a pathfinding that should avoid that multiple of my pacs run the same path to gather different pellets ...now i just have to include it in the code 
 Doju: instead of calculating it every time
 lifetimeLearner007: is it efficient for performance? every cell to every cell seems redundant.
 lifetimeLearner007: wouldn't it timeout?
 Doju: i'm gonna need it for some magic soon lifetimeLearner007
 Doju: no currently it has no optimizations and it runs in like 150 ms
 Doju: and i'm on python
 Icebox: it takes 80us for me to calculate that @lifetimeLearner007 .-.
 Doju: u?
 Doju: really?
 Doju: no way
 Icebox: yes u
 Doju: what on earth
 Doju: manhattan?
 Icebox: no, from all to all
 Tiramon: those stuff can be really fast if you do it the right way
 Icebox: C++ and I'm abusing the fact that the map is mirrored
 Doju: aha
 Doju: okay
 Doju: i might try that as well
 Doju: is it hard to incorporate?
 Tiramon: oh mirrored is a good point that should half the time
 Doju: mirroring and also not calculating paths in both directions
 Doju: im not sure how to put that in though
 Doju: i feel like i'll miss some cells with my current logic
 Icebox: that's not all
 lifetimeLearner007: i've no idea how to use mirror to my advantage.
 Icebox: I mean that's a good start but not everything
 Icebox: you can incorporate the fact that tiles in the line of sight will have distance equal to manhattan distance
 Doju: oh right
 Doju: but that's only like 5% of the tiles
 Icebox: if you take that into account, you will need to calculate only the distance from all intersections
 Doju: oooooohhhh
 Icebox: to all other intersections
 Doju: that's smart
 Doju: thanks
 Doju: if i run into performance issues i'll try to put that in
 jrke: any suggestion till i am in bronze
 Doju: wait, you can't use bfs for weighted graphs
 jrke: any other
 jrke: than BFS
 Doju: no need for bfs to get to bronze
 Doju: just manhattan distance will work
 Doju: or pretty much anything if you dont time out
 Doju: will get you to bronze
 jrke: no i am in bronze
 Doju: oh okay
 jrke: want to enter silver
 Doju: just make bfs it's not that hard
 Doju: ill help you
 lifetimeLearner007: I'm stuck in bronze too. is bfs+manhattan enough to clear bronze?
 jrke: K
 Doju: like the basic idea is
 Doju: you have a queue in which you add cells
 Doju: then you check those cells for neighbours
 Doju: and for every loop in the queue you add 1 to a distance variable
 jrke: K
 Doju: then for every fitting neighbour (aka is not a wall)
 Doju: their distance to the root cell is the distance variable
 jrke: understood but i tried it it time out
 lifetimeLearner007: prevent revisiting the same cell again. 
 Doju: yes that's a thing i forgot to mention
 jrke: it time out i tried today
 TrentT: Jrke are you using c++?
 Doju: you don't need c++ for that
 jrke: yes
 jrke: i know only c++ only that's why
 Doju: i mean its better for speed i just meant that timing out shouldn't really be an issue unless you're doing it wrong
 jrke: K
 thethiny: The #1 spot was C++
 jrke: i will try again
 jrke: By the way thanks
 Doju: np. im sure you can make it work
 jrke: yeah
 lifetimeLearner007: why is Dfs not a suitable choice for this?
 Doju: technically it's just as good for a flood fill than bfs i think
 Zandy156: that's what I'm using
 thethiny: because I tried it and I'm stuck at 226
 Doju: or just as good for getting every cell i mean
 Doju: not as good for a flood fill to the nearest matching cell
 thethiny: how do you get every cell with BFS without going over the time limit?
 lifetimeLearner007: I'm using dfs and if there is a continuous  path without walls, it just goes forever in that loop path
 Illedan: Reduce memory allocation.
 jrke: should i predict whole path or next few turns only
 Ikhadem: this collistion is screwing me T_T
 thethiny: I', not going over memory, just going over time
 Illedan: Using memory is slow.
 jrke: anybody to my ques
 Doju: jrke i'm just calculating the distances everywhere because it's fast enough
 thethiny: since when is using memory slow?
 Doju: might even do the paths to everywhere
 Zandy156: dfs you have to limit depth or prevent repeat cells
 jrke: no i mean i have to predict whole path or just next few turns
 thethiny: predict my future
 thethiny: will I get wealthy
 Zandy156: as many turns as you can in time
 Doju: don't know about that
 jrke: K
 jrke: thanks
 Durkin: I'd start with just picking what space gives the most value for that turn. Trying to predict everything is pretty massive, can work it in as you go
 Doju: Durkin that's solid advice
 daanolav: wait but games are supposed to last for max 200 turns right?
 thethiny: yes
 daanolav: because I had one of 244
 jrke: ya one me for 300+
 Zandy156: speed turns show as 2 turns
 daanolav: ooh
 Zandy156: if you keep track in your code I think it will still end in 200
 GarrethDean: are there hidden test cases&#160;? 
 daanolav: that makes more sense
 lifetimeLearner007: the game viewer shows frames, each turn can have multiple frames. If nobody ever uses speed, then it'll be 200. otherwise more
 thethiny: no
 thethiny: speed will increase the frame counter
 thethiny: I idled against myself spamming SPEED
 thethiny: and it ended at 200/200
 thethiny: meh wtv ignore what I said
 thethiny: I completely misunderstood you
 lifetimeLearner007: ignored... :P
 AntiSquid: this contest gonna reach 4k 
 thethiny: nice
 Icebox: So sad that ranking has been reworked .-.
 solaimanope: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461753963">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461753963</a>
 Icebox: imagine the juicy points for getting top 10 in 4k contest
 solaimanope: fighting for the last pellet^
 anid: Anyone using the dead pacs yet?
 thethiny: @solaimanope this is the best match I've ever witness
 Doju: lol a reportert for a newspaper just called me asking for an interview
 Doju: reporter*
 thethiny: nice
 thethiny: for what?
 Doju: because i'm gonna give a speech at our (web) graduation ceremony
 AntiSquid: but that was the issue, this might be the only contest that gets 4k in a long time Icebox
 MSmits: Icebox they redid the point-system, you might not get that many more points for a 4k contest compared to a 1k contest
 MSmits: the maximum is the same, the closer you are to the top, the smaller the point difference between the two size contests will be
 MSmits: if you're 1 in either contest, the points will be identical
 Durkin: Yikes, i've got some pretty nasty memory errors going on with my queue pop_front()
 shashwat986: So, maybe 150 people in Gold? Or will it be fewer?
 wlesavo: 80-100 i would say
 Uljahn: 50 or less :relieved:
 Uljahn: *fewer
 wlesavo: it was 80 for ooc i believe
 MrLovaLova: I have written of the solution but I still get an error. Where my If statement I get an error that it is not in a function. Anyone knows why it is like that?
 Cyberdog52: how do I get in silver league?
 MrLovaLova: while 1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1163bee1-fe5f-4e1d-85da-9dfa0313122f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1163bee1-fe5f-4e1d-85da-9dfa0313122f</a>
 Durkin: Need your bot to have a higher ranking than the Boss. More wins against stronger players than the boss gets as a ratio kind of thing, Cyberdog
 Cyberdog52: Ok thanks.
 MrLovaLova: Could someone look through the code I pasted, why does it complain about that my if statement is not in a function?
 Cyberdog52: You forgot&#160;:
 Vintarel: did you forget the&#160;:&#160;?
 MrLovaLova: Oh, thank you!&#160;:)(Y)(Y)
 MattSOrme: I'm adding the stupidest little tweaks now to try beat bronze. So close its upsetting
 MattSOrme: Last time i ran i literally ended in second after Inky...&#160;:'(
 TrentT: Where are you mattSOrme? I'm on 24
 MattSOrme: re-running now, hopefully my last bit will be enough to beat it
 MattSOrme: ugh. My rank dropped 200 places&#160;:/ 
 TrentT: What did you try?
 MattSOrme: Think the only thing I really changed was to prioritise a single step to a super pellet over using skills
 MattSOrme: but tbh, half the games im losing when i send to ide, i win 95% of the time. So its unclear whats really going wrong
 Doju: Can the grid be even in width or is it always odd?
 MattSOrme: 29 ≤ width ≤ 35
 Doju: huh
 Doju: i'm only getting odd maps in my testint
 Doju: testing
 MattSOrme: maybe. Its the same on left and right, so maybe it is always odd 
 Tiramon: code says in the generatorint generateWidth = grid.getWidth() / 2 + 1;
 Tiramon: so i guess it's always odd
 Doju: seems like it
 Doju: ahh do i do manhattan distance
 Doju: or do i get the distance 9 times
 jrke: hey doju
 Doju: this is stupid hah
 Doju: jrke hey hey
 MattSOrme: YAY. I won!
 jrke: its give output 0 or 3765..
 Doju: jrke umm what gives that output?
 jrke: what u suggested maybe any error in my code
 Doju: don't copy paste any code here but
 Doju: what does it vaguely look like?
 Doju: does it have a loop through every cell
 Doju: and a queue
 Doju: with a neighbouring cell thing in it
 Thiesjoo: MattSOrme what did you do to get into silver? I made many tweaks, but it's still not working out
 Tiramon: why not copy paste?
 Tiramon: as long as it is not top100 code&#160;;)
 Doju: Tiramon i copy pasted a little bit of code here to ask some questions and people didn't like it
 Doju: once just a super simple function where i asked which was cleaner
 Tiramon: ok depends on the problem, but if something isn't working best way to help is see the code or a replay
 Doju: and once i wrote some pseudo-code that didn't even exist in my own code and people told me not to do that
 jrke: yes doju i won,t copy it here 
 MattSOrme: Lots of things Thesjoo&#160;;) As long as your base logic is solid, just keep watching matches you lose and looking for problems
 Tiramon: and even if your pacs work good, could they be more effective
 MattSOrme: I'm python too, so while other people are searching 50 moves deep, im around 10
 Doju: if people are searching 50 moves deep they can't be searching very wide
 MattSOrme: Depends how you're trimming i guess. Thats something i need to go back to at some point
 Doju: there's this thing that you can't get any smart trapping plays or anything
 Doju: if you're trimming aggressively
 MattSOrme: My pacs are the least aggressive they can be. They never hunt or try to kill
 Doju: do you have that in your search?
 Doju: value for killing enemies
 MattSOrme: I'll add some easy killing in later. Its on my todo list. But an enemy thats gone down a dead end isn't my problem yet. Got bigger fish to fry
 Doju: oh hahah
 Doju: alright
 MattSOrme: still got silly decision making
 Doju: i was so impressed by euler's trap that he managed to do a few days ago
 Doju: i want to replicate that
 MattSOrme:&#160;??
 Doju: but i think that was using actual logic and not searching
 Doju: he used 2 pacs to trap an enemy in a corridor with no other exits
 MattSOrme: ah yeah. I'd thought about that, but the effort vs reward to program that, and the cost of calculating it...
 Tiramon: in one game i killed 2 pacs with one that try to do the same&#160;;)
 Doju: hmmm
 Doju: i think you could make it relatively cheap if you also sim the enemies
 Doju: and give a loot of value
 RockyMullet: making my bot ignore big pellets closer to enemy made my bot worse... I blame euler for this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461827144">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461827144</a>
 Doju: if an enemy is trapped between your pacs
 RockyMullet: I though first that the "dead" thing broke my bot
 MattSOrme: Another thought i had was to check score, and if im ahead just block them in, and change to counter them, but again, is it worth it?
 ShannonNorris97: RockeyMullet, in your replay how is it showing that text above the pac's heads? I've not seen that before
 MattSOrme: atm im also not using my first turn at all. I treat it the same as every other turn. So probably some huge gains there
 RockyMullet: yeah they dont really mention in it in the statement
 RockyMullet: you just add stuff after your output
 DollarAkshay: Morning people
 RockyMullet: like MOVE 0 1 2 Hello
 RockyMullet: hello DollarAkshay
 ShannonNorris97: Oh wow, that's awesome. That's gotta be so helpful for debugging. Thank you - I'm gonna use that now
 RockyMullet: yes mostly when I watch a bunch of games in the search of bugs, to undertand what let your bot to that decision helps a lot
 Doju: RockyMullet super helpful indeed
 Doju: watching my bots go RANDOM when there are still lots of unexplored cells atm :d
 Doju: Question:
 Doju: should I be working with coordinates (x, y) or cell instances that i have in my grid?
 Doju: currently i have both and its super messy
 wlesavo: lb feels so random, same code can place between 70 and 20, probably due to many quite simmilar bots 
 Doju: should i have for example my manhattan distance function taking coords or cells as input?
 dbdr: wlesavo it can also be that you are strong against one strategy and weak against another
 wlesavo: dbdr rock paper scisors? that couldn't be... :smiley:
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: personally, I think paper is the strongest
 RoboStac: yes, everyone should switch to paper at the start as it's the best
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 Doju: yes yes definitely everyone do paper, it's the best
 Doju: *sharpens scissors*
 dbdr: lol
 wlesavo: in real life when we played rps to decide smth i always played rock, just because i usually didnt care and would let people decide if they wont to win or lose
 RockyMullet: Doju personnaly I acces my cells data via positions in a 2d array, best of both worlds
 wlesavo: everybody knew that and still would play scisors sometimes
 dbdr: clever
 dbdr: you get them used to rock
 dbdr: then play scissors if you actually care
 Doju: RockyMullet well I kinda do that but it's such a pain to go "self.grid.grid[pos.y][pos.x]" every time i need a cell
 wlesavo: no, i mean they played scissors, i was consistent :slight_smile:
 dbdr: so they lost?
 <b>**dbdr checks the RPS rules</b></p><p><img src="/a/43076447322431" /> Doju: Btw is there some preferred pac type?
 Doju: like as default
 dbdr: I think it's fixed
 wlesavo: yes, they thought that i will change smth
 dbdr: id 0 is rock, id 1 is paper, etc
 wlesavo: but i didnt
 wlesavo: it lasted for like 4-5 years :slight_smile:
 Doju: uuhh.. any ideas
 dbdr: 3d chess :D
 Doju: i need to check a cell for its distance to the center
 Doju: but my bfs thing doesn't work if there's a wall there
 dbdr: wlesavo reminds me of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZSx3zNZOaU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZSx3zNZOaU</a>
 RockyMullet: Doju yeah I doing this in C++ so I made a simple macro just to be lazy and write it fast hahaha, to get a cell at a position
 Cyberdog52: Doju try to represent the grid as a graph of nodes
 Cyberdog52: Then you do not have walls at all
 Doju: Oh yeah i do have that
 Doju: but i need the distance to the center of the map
 SabertheLost: is the length not same as the depth of your bfs
 Doju: by path first and if unreachable, manhattan
 Cyberdog52: So what is the center of graph? There may not be a definitive solution
 Doju: that just seems like a horribly inefficient thing
 SabertheLost: Then first time do it and save the value to the length to the center.
 Doju: uhh i dunno i'll just do manhattan hahah
 SabertheLost: Find the center, do bfs from the center, update each cell with the length from the center as you find them
 Doju: oh riiight i'd need to write an edge case for the precompute function
 Cyberdog52: There may be multiple centers
 Doju: that does it even if the middle is a wall
 Doju: i guess i could try bfs from center cell and from every surrounding cell if that fails
 Doju: but that's stupid
 Doju: i'll just do manhattan
 wlesavo: dbdr i thought they would play rps :slight_smile: still funny though
 dbdr: it's pretty close though
 dbdr: it's like a 2 option RPS
 wlesavo: 3 actually
 dbdr: you should do the opposite of what you should do
 dbdr: this glass or that glass
 dbdr: what's the 3rd?
 wlesavo: both
 dbdr: lol
 dbdr: what about drink neither?
 wlesavo: are you also australian? :smiley:
 wlesavo: thats not an option, you accepted the duel
 dbdr: drink, but spit it out all over the other
 MattSOrme: why does the leaderboard tabs not work for companies and schools?
 wlesavo: i thought at some point the zorro man will just kill the guy while he was distracted
 dbdr: too simple
 MattSOrme: ah, it does, but my URL had some junk in it for some reason
 dbdr: it's a pretty good movie I think
 dbdr: I like parodies&#160;:)
 wlesavo: i think next time the contest should be with the battles decided by coinflip 
 Doju:  oooooohh i've been doing this in such a stupid way
 dbdr: would be a good troll community multi for April 1st
 dbdr: but make the rules super complicated to hide that fact
 AntiSquid: and post fake referee on github&#160;?
 dbdr: yeah, just said tht in MP :D
 dbdr: PM
 DollarAkshay: Why is CG slow&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: Oh looks like my chat messages are not going through
 avdg: many participants
 avdg: ah dunno
 dbdr: DollarAkshay they are not going through
 avdg: social distancing on networks is quite hard and unwanted I guess
 Quidome: is there a discussion somwhere on the collision rules
 Quidome: I am starting to build them in :D
 dbdr: read the source, Luke&#160;;)
 Quidome: Uh yes, that's an option
 Quidome: use the source, even better
 dbdr: don't believe anyone. how do you know if they are correct otherwise&#160;;)
 Quidome: but no luck I am not on Java
 dbdr: read, not use
 Quidome: youre doing wel dbdr
 dbdr: thanks!
 Quidome: This collission part is a big thing to build, hope i finish today
 Quidome: would be a big step&#160;:)
 ashikujjaman: how leadboard is calculated?
 RockyMullet: true skil<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill</a>
 Quidome: youre position is roughly the place where you have a 50% score against your neighbours
 RockyMullet: Quidome not bumping into your own pacs helps a lot
 Quidome: yes sure
 Quidome: That's why i am on it&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: good good&#160;:)
 Illedan: I have a stupid if stopping the first pac in my list if he wants to go to the same cell :D 
 Doju: Is storing functions in a dictionary clean in your guys's opinion?
 Quidome: I almost have a minmax on one move, which should solve the problem
 Doju: like i have some different methods of calculating possible target cells and currently my system is just ifs and elses
 Doju: but it's ugly and horrible
 wlesavo: you should've fight the ifs, not join them Illedan :slight_smile:
 dbdr: I have an easy way to get rid of ifs
 dbdr: if (condition) { ..}=&gt;while (condition) { ...; break; }
 wlesavo: nobody will call your bot as bunch of ifs after that for sure
 dbdr: mission accomplished
 dbdr: here's the bill
 wlesavo: for i in range(condition)
 Doju: aahh what is that atrocity
 Doju: does it even work?
 wlesavo: sure
 Doju: what? in python range requires an int
 wlesavo: python True is equal to 1
 Doju: Oh right
 Doju: sure
 Doju: it'll run once
 Doju: and i now need to go look at r/eyebleach
 wi_lius: condition &amp;&amp; (function() {
 Doju: maybe i should just bodge this together
 Doju: throw an exception handler on it
 Doju: hide it and never look at it again
 dbdr: ╰─➤  python3Python 3.5.2 (default, Oct  8 2019, 13:06:37) &gt;&gt;&gt; True + True2
 dbdr: seems legit
 RockyMullet: even truther
 Doju: such truth much wow
 fasil: heyyyyyyyyy 
 fasil: shall we develope an app for coding challenge
 RockyMullet: hey :sunglasses::point_right::point_right:
 RockyMullet: an app for what
 Doju: 👉😎👉 Zoop
 fasil: anyone intrested
 Quidome: you mean CG?
 GlitchyByte: So, defeating Inky moves you to Silver. I defeat it when I run it. How do I know if I defeat it when I submi?
 DollarAkshay: You move to silver if your Rating is higher than the boss
 DollarAkshay: Make sure you are defeating the boss &gt; 50% of the time
 DollarAkshay: more than 50% of the time*
 GlitchyByte: I guess I am not clear as to how rankings are calculated. Is it explained somewhere?
 GlitchyByte: But even the info you just gave me is useful. Thanks for that.
 wlesavo: GlitchyByte just submit and see what happens
 GlitchyByte: I did!
 Uljahn: search the forum, rank is calculated using TrueSkill (google it)
 GlitchyByte: Thanks Uljahn!
 Tiramon: nice last ifx moves me up in the top 200
 MattSOrme: eww. only just realised im still trying to send command and track for my dead pacs&#160;:/ 
 MattSOrme: wondered where the messed up behavious was coming from
 MattSOrme: treating random squares like walls... its cos it still thought a pac was there&#160;:/ 
 Tiramon: main reason why silver bot crashs ... forgot to skip dead pcas&#160;;)
 MattSOrme: what input tells me its dead? I don't see any in the inputs?
 Tiramon: typeId == "DEAD"
 MattSOrme: ah
 MattSOrme: that'll do it
 MattSOrme: thx
 Tiramon: if (typeId == "DEAD") continue
 Tiramon: solves most problems in silver&#160;;)
 Tiramon: quote:typeId: the pac's type (ROCK or PAPER or SCISSORS). If the pac is dead, its type is now DEAD.
 MattSOrme: Well for the most part i was still looking alright, my alive pacs were running round, and game wasn't crashing
 GlitchyByte: How long does it take to compute my ranking? I see it changing all the time. Even after Last Battles has completed 100%.
 Tiramon: around 17min my last submit
 RockyMullet: GlitchyByte it still change because other people are submiting
 RockyMullet: so you can ballte those new bots, changing your own ranking, or just having them improve and being ranked over your bot, meaning you go down
 MattSOrme: my bot was getting cornered even though it could run away. So hopefully that stops now :D
 RockyMullet: MattSOrme live to fight another day :D
 MattSOrme: looks like that fixed it :D
 MattSOrme: map no longer shows zombie pacs 
 AlexRSS: I'm trying to debug my code but for some reason when I click play my code, it's not showing any of the debug prints
 AlexRSS: Anyone had anything similar?
 MattSOrme: probably timing out in previous turn?
 GlitchyByte: Scroll to the top of the output. Or make sure you are using the IDE code and the submitted one (should say IDE CODE) on your avatar.
 GlitchyByte: Scroll to the top of the output. Or make sure you are using the IDE code and NOT the submitted one (should say IDE CODE) on your avatar.
 AlexRSS: Thanks, it was all hiding at the top
 AlexRSS: Are the x and y variables meant to update to show the current position of the pac, or do they just show its position at the start?
 Doju: AlexRSS i believe it's the current position
 Doju: or no i don't believe, i know.
 anid: any idea when gold opens?
 AntiSquid: yay 28 hours of people constantly asking when gold opens
 TheNiv: Why on each turn only one pac recieves a command if I use a for loop to print a command for each pac
 TheNiv:&#160;?
 Icebox: because everything has to be in one print TheNiv
 TheNiv: oh ok thanks
 Tiramon: quote:A single line with one or multiple commands separated by |. For example: MOVE 0 5 7 | MOVE 1 16 10.
 Pranab: can ny1 hlp? how to get t
 Tiramon: get what Pranab?
 Pranab: how to get multiple input as x,y to move the pac to different position
 Pranab: all of my pac is going to same positon
 Tiramon: so you don't want input, you want output ... ok
 Tiramon: almost at the bottom of the statement it says OutputA single line with one or multiple commands separated by |. For example: MOVE 0 5 7 | MOVE 1 16 10.MOVE pacId x y: the pac with the identifier pacId moves towards the given cell
 Tiramon: so if you want to send commands for different pacs you hav to change the pacId in the command
 Tiramon: and if they should move to different locations you should change the x,y parameter
 Pranab: how to change it?
 Tiramon: by printing out the string with another parameter , best read from a variable
 cegprakash: MadKnight should I mutate only on last depth?
 cegprakash: because if I mutate on depth1, I'll have to recompute everything from depth 1
 AntiSquid: you got the theory wrong ^
 cegprakash:&#160;:'(
 cegprakash: what do I do now
 Illedan: Just do full random mutation with 10% chance on each move or something
 cegprakash: and recompute everything?
 cegprakash: that's going to be time costly&#160;:(
 Illedan: What are you doing btw?
 cegprakash: meaning I need to give 20ms for search and mutation each
 Illedan: Monte carlo?
 AntiSquid: you're using c++ you should be fine on time ceg
 Illedan: C++ doesn't automatically write fast code..
 AntiSquid: not what i said
 Illedan: Kinda was&#160;:) 
 AntiSquid: just saying he has enough time due to the language he picked
 AntiSquid: well if i write it to run unnecessarily slow of course it won't work
 Illedan: My point still stands :P You can still write slow code in C++
 AntiSquid: of course you can
 AntiSquid: but that's optional
 wlesavo: cegprakash do what bluster did for ooc, paint a map by arrows, then mutate one arrow on your path
 cegprakash: Illedan my sims dropped from 90K to 6K
 AntiSquid: that's like A*Craft :o
 AntiSquid: brilliant idea
 cegprakash: if I mutate arrow on the path it'll give invalid moves
 cegprakash: I've restricted my movements to only valid
 cegprakash: meaning depth2 movement depends on depth1 movement of all the pacs
 wlesavo: you can precomputr valid moves for each cell
 cegprakash: mm.. not sure if that's a big performance improvement.. but I can try
 Smartasskilling: Can anyone help me with mars lander episode 2. I'm coding in python and i need a way to calculate where the flat surface is
 Clagus: ask again in 6 days :D
 wlesavo: Smartasskilling thats the easiest part, check neighbored y coors 
 AntiSquid: funny username
 Smartasskilling: So I just compare it in the input for statement and save that to a var?
 Smartasskilling: Nah it doesn't work
 NormantasStankevicius: Guys, how do you find the next best pellet to go to?
 Doju: i don't
 Doju: or i do, but the logic is only
 Doju: the best pellet is the closest one
 Doju: + favor super pellets just a bit
 AntiSquid: still working on that, don't think i select it correctly NormantasStankevicius
 TheNiv: Do you need to print the commands in new lines?
 TheNiv: or all of them in one line?
 NormantasStankevicius: Yeah, but there might be another location, with a bit further, but there are like 5 pellet cluster there
 Clagus: NormantasStankevicius you could try to go to the big ones
 Clagus: TheNiv all in 1 line
 Clagus: separated by "|"
 Rafal.Py: how do I append command to show some info on my pelletMOVE 0 5 7 | MOVE 1 16 10
 Doju: NormantasStankevicius yes that's true and my aprroach is flawed. I have an idea to fix it though
 AntiSquid: one single line, never more than that TheNiv , see statement for how to format it
 TheNiv: Thank you, I missed the '|'
 Doju: and that idea also allows me to simulate things pretty efficiently
 Clagus: MOVE 0 5 7 SomeInfo | MOVE 1 16 10 SomeInfo
 TheNiv: Where is this statement? AntiSquid
 Doju: by concentrating a bunch of moves into chunks
 Rafal.Py: The Clagus, is Someinfo 1 word or can it be something else?
 AntiSquid: just below the viewer, you can scroll down and it gives a lot of info about the game TheNiv
 TheNiv: Oh so I just didn't see it. I'll look again
 Tiramon: Rafal.Py you can write any string, as long as it does not contain a | 
 Uljahn: 7 chars max?
 Uljahn: hmm, 7 digits but not chars
 Clagus: Rafal.Py it's very short try it out yourself
 Kellthazar: Howdy&#160;:)
 muy31: sweet, my AI went from buggy to smart!
 MattSOrme: sometimes im not sure if im making my bots smarter or dumber
 AntiSquid: yes that's very difficult because the ladder is random
 wlesavo: yeah like a single point between 10 and 20
 wlesavo: and its even worse at lower ranks
 AntiSquid: i look at individual replays and check my overall winrate, but it's difficult to tell why some things don't work when you get no bugs
 eulerscheZahl: my rank mostly depends on my performance against kovi. how shall i get a realistic view that way?
 wlesavo: kovi-based mmr
 AntiSquid: also so far trying to predict the opponent always drops my rank no matter what, i think the bad plays ruin it, you overestimate the opponent sometimes
 eulerscheZahl: 182 battles vs kovi, next one got 37 battles vs me
 kovi: +performance of others vs. me....
 eulerscheZahl: oh, illedan is climbing too
 eulerscheZahl: but you spam submits destabilize the ranking
 Hjax: last night i hacked together some buggy horrible search thing and watched it beat my heuristic bot 
 MattSOrme: hmm. Im still getting timeouts, but when i send to ide it doesn't
 Hjax: my poor search takes so long to spin up, ill need to port this to C++ eventually 
 eulerscheZahl: my new submit has timeouts too :cry:
 hearthewarsong: Is there a way to download some kind of gamelogs? I remember some1 created statisctics in ooc,  but I cant find how (couldnt find in case of ooc neither).
 eulerscheZahl: these were my stats
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 Hjax: eulerscheZahl you are doing some monte carlo thing right? how many iterations of it can you do on the server? 
 kovi: szia hearhtwarsong!
 eulerscheZahl: i discarded that idea
 Hjax: oh did you? got some fancy new thing?
 eulerscheZahl: and my eval is by far the most expensive part
 eulerscheZahl: MC even failed to quickly pick up the super pellet sometimes, i have a proper search now
 eulerscheZahl: with ideas to make it better. but 50ms isn't much
 JohnCM: yea monte carlo can't work properly - you can only see a very limited depth
 JohnCM: bfs works better for longer distances
 AntiSquid: you have a guide on how to parse any replay eulerscheZahl&#160;? :p
 dbdr: MSmits is making MC work, isn't he?
 eulerscheZahl: of course AntiSquid. you don't? :D
 AntiSquid: no
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to test tech.io
 JohnCM: haha his is only good at the start
 JohnCM: i would say monte carlo is good at the start with enemy pos and type known
 eulerscheZahl: you can define a docker container there and get pretty much any library you want that way
 AntiSquid: i mean the view in the frame, not the std out
 JohnCM: euler won me a few times because he could predict where my pieces would head to and intercept them
 JohnCM: still quite impressed with the trapping part haha
 Doju: euler's trapping is amazing
 MattSOrme: do we know what rules/changes might be in gold? if any at all
 AntiSquid: no more changes
 eulerscheZahl: no changes
 MattSOrme: so its just to group top players?
 eulerscheZahl: there was even a newsletter about it. even silver changes weren't planned
 JohnCM: i think my bot is still missing something
 Hjax: Summary of new rules: You can now see your pacs favorite color, just to force everyone to fix their bots again 
 JohnCM: new rule: each superpellet now has a name
 ntroPi: Oh no, they ate Kenny!
 dbdr: I was thinking about superpellet making you able to eat any other pac
 dbdr: like in the original, kind of
 Doju: Oh that'd be interesting
 llllllllll: and giving you boost at the same time
 Hjax: that would be cool, but a super pellet never really survives more than 10 frames 
 JohnCM: haha when you eat a superpellet, you will be invincible for 10 turns
 AntiSquid: superpellets are now neutral pacs that play as if they were a 3rd player, they are controlled by whichever is 1st place bot at the time of the game is played
 JohnCM: lol.. that makes no diff to the current game actually
 JohnCM: since most bots get an equal number of superpellets
 AntiSquid: but the neutral pacs will clear pellets
 JohnCM: i'm trying so hard to beat euler's bot. now i have like 20-30% win rate. got to change some heuristics
 AntiSquid: why focus on one bot? 
 JohnCM: i find euler's bot quite all rounded
 AntiSquid: i mean i can get a win vs a lot of top 50 bots, but that doesn't change much
 JohnCM: so if can win his bot most likely can win the rest too
 Hjax: i dont know what my winrate against euler is, probably &lt;5% 
 wlesavo: yeah, optimizing against a single bot is not a good idea for sure
 Hjax: ran a few test games, my only win was a euler timeout 
 dbdr: I just realized, euler optimized his pseudo to minimize pings :D
 AntiSquid: what do you mean
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, timeouts are a problem now&#160;:(i added more tracking
 dbdr: hard to type without tab
 AntiSquid: eulerschezahl
 dbdr: so people white euler =&gt; no ping
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461963771">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461963771</a>
 Maliamnon: Is there some indication of when your rank is "stable"?
 JohnCM: lol how did i lose so much late game
 wlesavo: ezpz AntiSquid 
 dbdr: s/white/write/ :D
 wlesavo: white euler lol
 AntiSquid: contest ends Maliamnon, that's a good indication
 wlesavo: JohnCM strange nicknames in that replay 
 muy31: why is promoting so problematic? i beat the boss everytime 
 Hjax: your rating needs to be higher than the boss when you finish calibrating muy31
 JohnCM: haha what nicknames?
 muy31: can i just resubmit and hope i get lucky?
 wlesavo: JohnCM oh, nwm, it works now, somehow i saw blinky and inky names instead of real ones 
 wlesavo: similar to a preview
 JohnCM: you know i spent like 4 hours modelling enemy behavior and it made my bot worse
 Hjax: muy31 thats probably time better spent improving your bot 
 JohnCM: then i scrapped the whole thing
 JohnCM: XD
 JohnCM: cause the bot became too cautious
 muy31: Hjax remember me? who tried to implement an entirely new path algorithm and failed until it just started working? do you really think i want to do that again?
 muy31: now my bot is definitely better than my old one
 ashikujjaman: how can I play my bot with my friends bot
 muy31: and it should be good enough to be in silver
 Hjax: if its good enough to be in silver it will promote 
 Vintarel: JohnCM it happens to me all the time, always trying to improve but it's always worse xD
 JohnCM: ya.. actually i'm kind of curious if ga can work for this now
 muy31: it's not like those currently ranked 500 - 600 in silver will beat my bot
 ashikujjaman: please help mehow can I play my bot with my friends bot of spring challenge
 JohnCM: like have some parameters for eating up a pellet and exploring based on the total game score. and also whether or not to attack
 muy31: ashikujjaman delete the AI bot agent and add a new one
 JohnCM: i tried monte carlo and it didn't work out very well (at least after the first few frames)
 Uljahn: you both should be in top-1000 i guess
 JohnCM: and you need an additional heuristic for the super pellet if not it will be like a one in a million or worse chance of finding it
 Vintarel: what is ga&#160;?
 JohnCM: genetic algorithm
 muy31: ashikujjaman, under Players, wher it says your username and the boss name
 ashikujjaman: muy31 didn't understandcan you play your bot with my bot?
 muy31: but you have to be in the same league i think
 ashikujjaman: muy31 ashikujjaman
 muy31: oh yes
 muy31: here you are
 Yitzhakpro: i cant rly understand how can i preevnt them from stucking
 ashikujjaman: bot name inky

 Doju: time to submit, i guess
 Tiramon: Vintarel GA isn't more complicated than other simulation based stuff
 Csipcsirip_2: anyone using SA&#160;? 
 Vintarel: Tiramon haha ok,  I just find that any simulation looks difficult to use in this problem
 Hjax: i think cegprakash is @Csipcsirip_2
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: that can't be
 AntiSquid: nvm missread @_@
 AntiSquid: lol dropped kovi randomly
 Csipcsirip_2: first time I try this algo, but it's very unstable atm. might be buggy tho
 Doju: oh hold on
 AntiSquid: onto what
 Doju: I'm making my path_length way too large
 Doju: i dunno
 Doju: something
 Tiramon: maybe his path_length.. if it is so long it should be stable enough
 Doju: yes that's good
 Doju: length 200 paths
 Tiramon: so you plan right from the begining to the end?
 Doju: Oh i'm upping it for every cell in the queue
 Tiramon: as long as you have not used speed
 Doju: no, i'm just doing a bfs wrong lol
 Illedan: WTF
 Illedan: how did this go this high
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: many ppl in the contest hate you coz of that  Illedan :D
 JohnCM: congrats illedan
 JohnCM: i think cause a lot of ppl at the top resubmitted at the same time too
 Illedan: still my code from saturday, just changed a number
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Doju: hahah
 JohnCM: i'm having my all time high rank of 80 now
 JohnCM: i think sure drop
 AntiSquid: so everything after saturday is a pile of bugs in your bot Illedan&#160;? :p
 eulerscheZahl: i told you to uncrash your bot Illedan
 Illedan: Does it crash?
 Illedan: I made some small fix for that
 eulerscheZahl: i mean you did what i told you and how you are at the top
 eulerscheZahl: and now*
 Illedan: Pure luck
 Illedan: I did nothing more to track enemies :D
 Illedan: I'll accept it
 eulerscheZahl: my basic tracking works
 eulerscheZahl: the improved tracking causes timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: too slow
 Icebox: oh god my new bot just got it's first win since sunday
 Icebox: \o/
 Illedan: :rocket:
 JohnCM: woohoo
 Illedan: Small step for a man, giant leap for pacman
 NormantasStankevicius: ^
 Icebox: the fruits of 2h sleep per day and 2k lines of C++
 JohnCM: wow you got to sleep more man
 Icebox: those sims aint gonna write themselves
 AntiSquid: sims <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/GZEslCX">https://imgur.com/GZEslCX</a>
 Icebox: ofc
 Icebox: what else were you thinking about?
 Uljahn: Icebox: you switched to c++? so no streams in py3 anymore? :broken_heart:
 AntiSquid: oh right did you do silver open stream&#160;?
 Icebox: I can still stream in py3 :3
 Icebox: AntiSquid no I didn't feel confident enough to get to silver in 2-3 hours
 AntiSquid: huge bronze
 JohnCM: all the best icebox
 JohnCM: you can do i
 JohnCM: it
 Illedan: Do you want a stream from wood - silver?
 Illedan: :thinking:
 JohnCM: i'm quite interested to see who wins this competition, and also what algo they use
 JohnCM: shall wait till the end of the competition
 Hjax: the winners always use some form of arcane magic 
 Hjax: :P
 Uljahn: you mean pragmas? :smirk:
 Icebox: you shall unroll thy loops
 eulerscheZahl: the winners almost always write a forum post, explaining the strategy in huge detail
 JohnCM: shall wait for yours then euler. i have faith in your bot
 JohnCM: i'm still thinking about how you so effectively trap me at a dead end
 muy31: euler made 
 muy31: JohnCM his b*
 muy31: JK
 JohnCM: lol
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i just bruteforce killing options
 eulerscheZahl: and if i find one, i take it
 JohnCM: that's the monte carlo you were talking about right
 JohnCM: but that's a lot of steps in advance, close to 5 steps of predicting the opponent
 JohnCM: like there's one case i go get a superpellet in a dead end, and your pac just entered the dead end too
 JohnCM: resulting in a kill
 eulerscheZahl: i discarded my monte carlo
 eulerscheZahl: and the killing is a distinct search which doesn't even care about collecting pellets.
 anid: any idea what the gold cutoff could be?
 eulerscheZahl: between rank 50 and 100
 JohnCM: yup i can see that
 JohnCM: i played many simulations against your bot
 anid:&#160;:( was hoping on top 200 :P
 JohnCM: must thank you for helping me improve my heuristic values
 JohnCM: it kind of worked
 Doju: I'm trying to get the "depth" of my breadth first search
 Doju: should i queue the neighbours into the original queue or is there a smarter way?
 MattSOrme: is the boss just created by copying the bot in that position? when its time?
 Doju: everything that i looked up didn't deal with lengths
 Illedan: Click on the League icon above the viewer
 ntroPi: Doju, have a second queue and swap when done with the first.
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it will be a player chosen by CodinGame. it will be tomorrow 6pm CEST
 eulerscheZahl: so gold opens in about 25h from now
 wlesavo: damn, so even fatality also there
 MattSOrme: and there was me thinking CG just had a couple good bots ready to go 
 NapTown: Doju you can walk back parents
 eulerscheZahl: taking a usercode is way easier for them :D
 MattSOrme: yup
 Doju: NapTown i was doing that but it's slow and unnecessary since i dont' need the actua paths
 MattSOrme: makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: but they check the code at least to see if funky things are going on
 eulerscheZahl: like a kill switch
 Doju: ntroPi ooh that's an itneresting idea
 kovi: fatility it not fatility here, a kill may cause pellets...and the game
 kovi: it is not finisher i mean
 NapTown: Doju maybe keep a depth value for each parent and +1 each child
 Doju: actually i got a better idea
 Doju: im gonna stick some other objects in the queue
 Doju: after adding every child
 Doju: and += 1 the depth when i hit the other objects
 ntroPi: as a marker? swapping is probably faster.
 Doju: really?
 Doju: huh maybe i need to swap then
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl not sure if you addressed this in a more recent submit (this is obsolete), but your pac suicided<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461967018">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461967018</a>
 ntroPi: Don'T worry too much about it, it's not like your marker idea would be super slow.
 Doju: although my queue runs at o(1)
 Doju: so i think it
 Doju: it's pretty fast
 Doju: if i add markers, that is
 wlesavo: kovi yeah, not even sure if it is worth implementing
 eulerscheZahl: thanks BenjaminUrquhart. i still do the same nonsense&#160;:(
 BenjaminUrquhart: np
 BenjaminUrquhart: also found a bug in my own code
 eulerscheZahl: i don't find a way to survive when taking 2 cells at once
 MadKnight: don't make bugs in your own code BenjaminUrquhart
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't check in range 1
 BenjaminUrquhart: thanks MadKnight
 Counterbalance: argh... 1 - 2 = 1.84467e+19
 Scarfield:&#160;?
 Counterbalance: a bug in my scoring
 Scarfield: noo
 BenjaminUrquhart: solid math
 Counterbalance: score += 1000.0 * (players[0].pacs.size() - players[1].pacs.size());
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait...i just don't see you up there BenjaminUrquhart
 Adnmaster: how can we understand if one of our pac's is dead?
 eulerscheZahl: you are hidden
 Adnmaster: for example if my pac is dead i dont want it to move
 Adnmaster: how can i understand the id of the pac that is dead?
 eulerscheZahl: and my advanced tracking is too slow as it is
 Kellthazar: pac.type == "DEAD"
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 [CG]Thibaud: (in Silver only)
 Kellthazar: typeId
 Adnmaster: not in bronze?
 [CG]Thibaud: before, they're not given to you
 Kellthazar: Oh, yes...
 Kellthazar: Good point
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: so im in bronze i cant use it
 Scarfield: you dont get input for that pac if its dead, if in bronze set all pacs to dead in end of turn, the ones of yours you get input for set to alive
 [CG]Thibaud: if you try to move them, the referree will make you lose
 BobLaserShark: Out of curiosity, does anybody know if `math.sqrt(x)` or `x ** 0.5` is faster in python3? I can run a bench if not
 Vintarel: the difference might be in microsec :D
 Icebox: sqrt @BobLaserShark
 BobLaserShark: Yeah, but I'm computing it a couple thousand times per update, so shaving some time off would be great
 Illedan: Benchmark it BobLaserShark. And try caching too
 Icebox: afaik all math functions are written in C so math.&lt;anything&gt; is usually faster than any python equivalent
 Adnmaster: is there no way to get the id of a dead pac?
 Doju: computing sqrt a couple thousand times per update D:
 Scarfield: "you dont get input for that pac if its dead, if in bronze set all pacs to dead in end of turn, the ones of yours you get input for set to alive"
 Doju: i wonder what you're doing
 Scarfield: MCTS?
 BobLaserShark: to be fair, I probably shouldn't be worried too much about speed when I'm writing in python :laughing:
 Icebox: ^
 Doju: BobLaserShark i think the opposite is true
 MarekM: opposite, 100ms is very short time&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: 50ms is shorter
 wlesavo: true
 zarif98sjs: any idea how many people will advance to gold&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: anid 04:44PMany idea what the gold cutoff could be?eulerscheZahl 04:44PMbetween rank 50 and 100
 BobLaserShark: I was more looking at it from the fact that if I wanted speed, I should be using a different langauge
 Doju: i swear to god i never write "if x == True" on the first try
 Doju: it's only when i get the syntax error that i realise i wrote "if x = True"
 BobLaserShark: Doju&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: if x:
 Doju: and
 Doju: that was an example
 NapTown: if x yes
 Doju: the "True"
 Doju: just when checking anything
 Doju: also what the hell
 eulerscheZahl: you should switch to pascal then
 Doju: how is it possible that i get the sound for a usb disconnecting
 eulerscheZahl: if x = 3 then x&#160;:= 4;
 wlesavo:&#160;:=
 Doju: when i get a static shock from my chair
 BobLaserShark: I had a c++ program that wasn't behaving properly... took me a few hours to track down the error being
 Doju: and i'm not even touching anything linked to my computer
 wlesavo: that gives me some flashbacks
 eulerscheZahl: or basic which has = for both check and assign
 Scarfield: you are in a simulation Doju, glitch in the matric
 Scarfield: matrix*
 BobLaserShark: I... do not like basic
 Doju: I actually quite like this syntax x&#160;:= 4
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because it's a horrible language
 eulerscheZahl: basic
 BobLaserShark: Could be&#160;:)
 shashwat986: gratz eulerscheZahl
 shashwat986: rank 3
 BobLaserShark: Better than matlab though
 shashwat986: erm 4
 eulerscheZahl: going up and down, was 2nd before
 wlesavo: write in pseudo code a &lt;-- b
 eulerscheZahl: and below 100 with my broken submit :D
 BobLaserShark: a &lt;-- b actually means something in c++
 Peudoki: people breaking their code gave me 5th place :D
 eulerscheZahl: we are still in the relaxing stage of the contest

 Peudoki: By that time we can be legends
 BobLaserShark: It do it again&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: while x-- &gt; 0
 BobLaserShark: Yes
 Scarfield: click the link and see, too many new lines or too much text chat creates a pastebin
 BobLaserShark: int x = 10; while (x --&gt; 0) { cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl; }
 BobLaserShark: We'll do that
 jrke: hey any suggestion how to pass bronze
 BobLaserShark: @jrke git gud&#160;:)
 jrke: means?
 Scarfield: lol, win and also dont lose
 BobLaserShark: Pretty much ^
 jrke: plz give me any suggestion
 RoboStac: looking at a random loss in your last battles you have real issues targetting the same spot with multiple pacs and don't appear to have a fallback for when there aren't any visible pellets
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462011320">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462011320</a>
 RoboStac: oh and the enemy gets all 4 big pellets which shouldn't ever happen
 jrke: K thanks
 kovi: it could happen, if you trappped all 4 and kill 4 out of 4/5 pacs&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that gameplay reminds me of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azl5jxcXCZk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azl5jxcXCZk</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: I think I broke my submit, cool
 BenjaminUrquhart: let's see how this turns out
 Tiramon: wow nice 142 ... thats far better than i expected
 Doju: Is there a penalty for bad submissions?
 Doju: like is it bad to submit something that time outs instantly
 Doju: if you fix it
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you fix it, you're fine
 Doju: because i want to experiment with a constant that i have
 Doju: to see which value gives me the best winrate
 JohnCM: haha even if you submit the same constant you'll get different results
 Doju:&#160;:|
 JohnCM: but the range is normally += 100
 JohnCM: so you can still gauge
 JohnCM: if you suddenly rise by more than 100 ranks probably is a good thing
 Doju: this calls for science
 Tiramon: and alot of patience
 Tiramon: what about running it localy against your own bot?
 Doju: oh sure, that's a good idea
 BenjaminUrquhart: usually my initial placement when submitting (when I first get a submit percentage) is around 300
 Doju: thanks Tiramon
 MattSOrme: what happens if you submit again while its still testing?
 BenjaminUrquhart: when I submitted just now, it was 500
 BenjaminUrquhart: MattSOrme it resets
 AntiSquid: if you submit that way enough times you unlock a fun mini game where you need to spot different objects in pictures MattSOrme
 ZarthaxX: aka captchza
 ZarthaxX: fuck&#160;:(
 MattSOrme: I just got an x and y the wrong way round, so fixed it and re-submitted
 AntiSquid: you ruined the excitement ZarthaxX
 MattSOrme: but it was only about 56% through testing
 Doju: AntiSquid you get to participate in training a self driving car
 ZarthaxX: MattSOrme no problem with that
 ZarthaxX: u can submit at any time, just make sure to have your best submit for the end of the contest there :P
 Doju: i get the row and column of the pac
 muy31: obv same x or y, and then ...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c2e13508-763a-455b-89d9-9ed9c327b4d0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c2e13508-763a-455b-89d9-9ed9c327b4d0</a>
 ZarthaxX: mb squido lol
 Doju: then split the lists at the position of the pac
 Illedan: Lol, code that ended 2nd earlier ended 31 now :D That luck earlier
 Doju: and loop through the lists until i hit a wall
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan :D
 jrke: hey i have line of sight working properly collion are solved and defence and attack also but how to collaborate with other pacs
 aangairbender: do you guys use any kind of tree search here?
 dbdr: or reverse, Illedan
 AntiSquid: i get 50 rank difference twoo inbetween submitting same code
 dbdr: be optimistic
 Illedan: Unlucky now?
 Illedan: Try again? :P
 dbdr: yeah
 njaber: BenjaminUrquhart  By "that way", do you mean "when it's still battling"? What would happen if I tried to make an AI that automatically submits itself and waits for the battles to finish to submit again? Would that work/be allowed?
 eulerscheZahl: 3rd submit
 eulerscheZahl: to decide
 BenjaminUrquhart: njaber you get x submits per hour
 Illedan: Ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: or something like that
 AntiSquid: no, jst submit until 2nd again, obviously that's your rank so spam submits
 dbdr: isn't there a problem now? Play in IDE does not happen, network timeout
 jrke: anybody to my ques
 njaber: IS the exact number written somewhere?
 aangairbender: maybe faq?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I think it's something like 10 idk
 Csipcsirip_2: my submitted bot is MCTS. but it does not seem to work very well aangairbender. trying to change it to something smrter
 dbdr: why the smurf Csipcsirip_2?
 aangairbender: I am just thinking about beginning of the game
 aangairbender: players know all info about game
 dbdr: "Network error: status -1"
 AntiSquid: this randomness makes life really difficult
 AntiSquid: i add a feature and then i have to tripple check to make sure it's not bugged because of random ladder outcome
 dbdr: AntiSquid usually there is something to fix that will make yourr bot more consistent
 dbdr: I just had that today
 eulerscheZahl: to download the error log dbdr
 Csipcsirip_2: I needed an account without attached gmail account to get eulers offline debugger to work
 AntiSquid:  /ban alts
 jrke: watch this close call battle and suggest me if anything wrong
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462021469">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462021469</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: n e g a t i v e  o n e
 dbdr: Csipcsirip_2 you can just do a password reset
 kovi: leaderboard works again
 dbdr: I had a gmail account originally
 Csipcsirip_2: really? cool gonna try that
 NickStahl: jrke, lot of collisions within your own bots and looks like your bots are often targeting the same pellet
 jrke: how to avoid that?
 muy31: when a pac finds a pellet, disable the other pacs from finding it
 jrke: K
 NickStahl: jrke - collision of own bots: Calculate the path your bot is going for and if your second bot is going the same way, do something else until that is not the case anymore&#160;:)
 NickStahl: and what muy31 says
 dbdr: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jrke: thats the problem i am not able to calculate where my bot will go
 NickStahl: But... I'm too lazy to program it myself, so better listen to the other guys here.
 NickStahl: jrke, it's not that hard, lookup BFS algoritm
 AntiSquid: dbdr maybe i need to fix something to make the bot rank consistent, but now i am heading towards top 50 with a bot that got 150 previously, this is ridiculous&#160;:/
 dbdr: if it's because your bot plays great in some settings and badly in others, why is it ridiculous?
 dbdr: maybe depending on map size, number of pacs, opponent style, etc...
 AntiSquid: are you sure it's just that?
 dbdr: I cannot be
 dbdr: I'm saying I often observed that
 dbdr: and that's constructive
 ZarthaxX: the variable size is a factor
 ZarthaxX: unless i guess you make a good top bot, it may generate that variations
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: well will try to check if that's the case for my bot, need to stabilize somewhere @_@
 Peudoki: this game is quite random because of the fog, so random results are normal
 eulerscheZahl: even top players randomly walk into opponents and lose against sub-100 opponents
 NickStahl: AntiSquid, maybe the amount of dead-ends... Walking into those is costly.
 kovi: the problem is the low number of games in top
 Csipcsirip: thanks dbdr it works
 Peudoki: I have a friend who I sometimes test against, he is 190th, I'm 3rd and he can beat me 10-20%
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 Doju: oh are you seriously saying "if something":
 Doju: doesn't return True if something is an instance of a custom class
 BenjaminUrquhart: "if something:" basically means "something" exists
 BenjaminUrquhart: oversimplified but whatever
 Doju: it's returning false when i try it on my cell class&#160;:/
 Counterbalance: Doju <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bool__">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__bool__</a>
 Doju: ooh thats exactly what i need
 Doju: thanks
 Doju: i was trying to google __if__ xd
 Counterbalance:&#160;:)
 Doju: Hmm, "If a class defines neither __len__() nor __bool__(), all its instances are considered true."
 Doju: it's still not working even though i defined __bool__() as True
 Doju: but i think i can figure it out from here
 Counterbalance: then maybe the variable is undefined after all?
 Doju: it's defined
 Doju: i just printed them out
 Doju: &lt;__main__.Cell object at 0x7f29ec4f7a50&gt;
 Doju: wait what?
 Doju: there's something else going on
 berries: should i use a dfs?
 Doju: I thought of using dfs at first but ended up doing bfs
 Doju: can't really say which one is better
 aangairbender: berries dfs doesn't search shortest path
 aangairbender: but any path
 berries: okay yeah i thought it should be shortest path but i wasnt sure 
 cegprakash: but dfs can help u avoid getting into choke points
 Doju: ooh true cegprakash!
 berries: what do you mean by a choke point
 cegprakash: so use both Doju
 cegprakash: only one opening @berries
 Scarfield: dead end, but what are you intending to do with dfs/bfs berries?
 Saiz: so is there anything besides somehow running the game locally I can do to actually debug my code? prints aren't enough to look at my tree
 cegprakash: what tree
 MonZtaDeluxe: oh - big pellets info is delivered from the beginning?
 cegprakash: u can use debugger
 Doju: MonZtaDeluxe technically every pellet's info is known at the beginning
 Scarfield: not really, locally is the way, make your script print out the games state, use that print to setup your local run, and debug
 Scarfield: the games state when you have an issue
 SamuelTheBad: big pellets can always be seen, if that's whatchu mean
 Saiz: guess that works... thanks, might try it.
 MonZtaDeluxe: okay i see - but you won't get an update, if the opponent gets it, right?
 berries: Scarfield just modifying my algorithm because i finally got my pac to eat things
 Doju: For the big pellets you can deduce it
 Doju: for the small ones no
 Scarfield: its no longer there, so ^
 SamuelTheBad: well, if an opponent gets it, you won't receive it's location next time
 SamuelTheBad: oh, that's exactly what you asked. yeah, sorry
 berries: also is anybody's pac timing out for no good reason sometimes?
 Scarfield: ah okay, i would suggest starting with bfs for shortest path, anyway one thing at the time :p
 styphoiz: bad codee
 berries: like all the ones im losing my pac had timed out
 Doju: I don't really know why my depth thing is not working...
 Doju: it's going waay too high but the bfs itself is working
 Counterbalance: berries your bot probably takes too long on some turns. Print the time each turn takes; you won't see the time on the turn that times out but it gives you an idea about how much time your bot takes
 Doju: oh i'm a dummy
 Counterbalance: store the result of System.getCurrentTimeMillis() (IIRC) right after you read the first line of the turn input (the scores), and do it again right before you print the command and print the difference to stderr
 muy31: hey eulerscheZahl you still there?
 Ramzel:  has not provided 1 lines in time
 muy31: what's the significance of implementing a break if a location has already been found eulerscheZahl
 muy31: for your line of sight code
 RoboStac: you can have maps that wrap round in a line with no walls, so if you don't do that you have an infinite loop
 muy31: oh i see
 IAmNoob: hi:))
 muy31: but what if you already found that position from another pac
 RoboStac: you need a different found positions per pac
 Hjax: my vision loop just breaks if a pac sees its own location 
 Doju: RoboStac oh i didn't even consider that
 Ramzel: Only BLINKY still has pacs standing!
 Ramzel: Can u explain it?
 Doju: luckily as a consequence of my function it doesn't matter
 Doju: Ramzel your pacs are dead
 DecH0: Hello All
 Doju: Hi DecH0
 Ramzel: Why are my pacs dead?
 IAmNoob: they got killed
 SamuelTheBad: you get that message usually when you do something "illegal"; attempt to move a dead pac, time out, or move to an invalid coord
 Doju: i'm guessing you either timed out or gave an invalid command
 IAmNoob: for example
 VicHofs: Ramzel you probably timed out
 Ramzel: Thanks so much
 VicHofs: I'm having issues with that too
 muy31: so do we now get dead pacs?
 VicHofs: muy31 yes
 muy31: for bronze?
 [CG]Thibaud: in Silver only
 VicHofs: yes
 Scarfield: in silver its input as typeid
 SamuelTheBad: yeah, your pacs get killed in bronze
 VicHofs: pacs die in bronze too but they don't spawn dead no
 Counterbalance: no-one reads their mail huh
 SamuelTheBad: you'll have to filter it by whether you receive an input line for that pac next turn
 VicHofs: @Counterbalance&#160;?
 Counterbalance: we got a mail about silver changes
 Ramzel: Is there a way to get cords of pacs before any turn?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 SamuelTheBad: if you mean where they where at the end of last round, you'll have to store their old position yourself
 VicHofs: Ramzel in bronze only if you can see them
 VicHofs: @Counterbalance yeah I saw that
 Ramzel: I m writing in c++, only thing i do in game loop is reading input(packing it into vectors),  and printing last element of other vector? The error i get is:  Ramzel has not provided 1 lines in time
 muy31: timeout
 eulerscheZahl: wow, 4000 players already
 dbdr: \o/
 Ramzel: So is reading input to slow?
 VicHofs: anyone else getting seemingly randdom timeouts in python tho
 VicHofs: * random
 eulerscheZahl: Ramzel do you start the timer before reading the first line?
 eulerscheZahl: then you are waiting for your opponent to take an action and what not
 Hjax: this contest is crazy huge 
 ZarthaxX: biggest contest after accountant?
 Scarfield: is your output in the format: MOVE pacId x y Ramzel
 anid: Oh, just saw that it crossed the 4K mark
 Ramzel: Yes it is
 S1L3nCe: Ramzel, check array out of bound access or in loop condition
 Hjax: utg only had 2162 
 AntiSquid: 4k celebration!
 Ramzel: I think thats not a problem S1L3nCe
 Doju: AntiSquid no we're too busy coding
 AntiSquid: then why you in chat
 anid: :D
 Doju: errr you got me
 VicHofs: Automaton2000 can celebrate with yall ask em
 Automaton2000: so i cant use it
 Doju: i'm trying to find this stupid bugggg
 VicHofs: plus AutomatonNN too
 Doju: but nope its not happening
 anid: Hey AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there an actual problem in the corner case of expert rules in the 1000 turns
 Scarfield: maybe start looking for a smart bug, could help :p
 AutomatonNN: kovi is the last contest boss cause i can't solve the problem
 VicHofs: yo eulerscheZahl did you write this mf
 anid: Hmm eulerscheZahl, must be a pain now that it knows ur name
 Hjax: i wish those bots were banned 
 Scarfield: magu-s did, but it loves euler
 VicHofs: yeah wtf
 Hjax: is kovi ever not calibrating 
 Scarfield: 600 submits yet? :p
 eulerscheZahl: the bot got much better actually
 eulerscheZahl: initially it pinged me about once in 4-5 messages
 ZarthaxX: Hjax nope
 ZarthaxX: only when sleeping
 Scarfield: I still hope for someone making an A-W-E-S-O-M-0-2000 bot someday
 Hjax: there should be a cooldown on submits lol 
 ZarthaxX: there is
 ZarthaxX: u start getting captchas
 SamuelTheBad: Enemy timed out but game ended in a draw? The probability hurts.
 Hjax: lol
 Scarfield: oh thought you meant there was an awesomo bot xD
 AntiSquid: image recognition mini game ZarthaxX
 AntiSquid: you're supposed to train an NN for it and continue to submit spam, see how far you go
 anid: just found this link
 anid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/tree/d71009713f346163031ad2ad99198a0ef60f56a3/config">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/tree/d71009713f346163031ad2ad99198a0ef60f56a3/config</a>
 anid: should it be public?
 Scarfield: Technical DetailsYou can check out the source code of this game on this GitHub repo.
 Scarfield: its in the statement&#160;:)
 anid: No, this is the code for the bosses
 Scarfield: yea, juist the wood bosses
 eulerscheZahl: in the past CG even linked to the bosses in an email to help the users getting started
 eulerscheZahl: it's still a very basic bot
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid so your theory is that kov i has it?
 AntiSquid: has what
 ZarthaxX: the NN that makes he spam submit
 eulerscheZahl: for kutulu we didn't publish the wood boss. but that beast had 1000 lines :D
 AntiSquid: should get extra xp for beating extra hard wood bosses 
 Waffle3z: down to the last pellet <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462073775">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462073775</a>
 anid:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: no food waste
 Waffle3z: interesting that I won since I let them get 3 super pellets
 Waffle3z: not only that but they're in 1st place
 ntroPi: On the other hand you ate two of his pacs, those are tasty too. Your bot is less of a pelletarian than others it seems.
 anid: I dont see a no further rules message here
 anid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3eaf877a-188b-48bd-a219-2e59f50c9ecf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3eaf877a-188b-48bd-a219-2e59f50c9ecf</a>
 anid: could there be new rules in gold?
 Scarfield: "You can now see pacs that have died."
 eulerscheZahl: We've just opened the Silver league with a few modifications that you can find here. There won't be any change to the game after that. 
 eulerscheZahl: from an email that CG sent6h ago
 anid: thanks
 Doju: no this can't be...
 Doju: my precalc is timing out
 Doju: on the first cell
 Doju: what?!
 eulerscheZahl: BFS?
 Doju: yes
 anid: first cell requires highest computation
 eulerscheZahl: you screwed up implementation
 Doju: yeah eulerscheZahl i think so
 eulerscheZahl: probably visiting each cell more than once
 Doju: nope
 Doju: wait no
 Doju: hold on
 muy31: make sure
 Doju: oh i might be
 Doju: i thought i wasn't because i was testing the length of a set
 Doju: but its a set...
 Doju: no, the list's length is only around 200 when i time out
 AntiSquid: Waffle3z i think you should also ping them when you brag about beating them, it's like the cherry on the cake
 Doju: this time i got like 7 cells done because i wasn't printing anything out 
 Doju: but still thats so slow
 Doju: and i was doing the whole thing (although with the wrong depth readings) in like 100 ms
 Doju: it just ran very fast locally
 Doju: wait no, are you serious
 Doju: it was timing out because i was printing stuff out
 Doju: lmao
 muy31: lol
 MSmits: quick question, if a pac is this what the speed over time looks like: 0,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,0,2,2,2,2,2   or do i have an off by one error somewhere?
 Doju: i just debugged my prints for 2 hours
 MSmits: if a pac is chain-speeding i mean
 eulerscheZahl: looks fine MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: chat is laggy again
 MSmits: k i was confused by the 4 1's 
 muy31: yeah i think so
 muy31: cooldown time
 eulerscheZahl: after SPEED you get 9(=cooldown) 5(=speed) as the next input
 BenWo: afternoon all
 eulerscheZahl: confused me too at first
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: now i just accepted it
 MSmits: yeah as long as it is correct I am fine with it
 Hyslach653: hi everyone, i'm trying the mars lander game and im having an issue where it says that i didnt provide an input in due time. could anyone hand me a tip or sth? very much appreciated thnx 
 MattSOrme: jeez, theres nothing like putting yourself against a top player to show how crap your bots are&#160;:(
 muy31: Hyslach653 you are timing out
 MSmits: it's the best way MattSOrme
 eulerscheZahl: which one just crushed you?
 Hyslach653: yes, but I already declared input and there is no way my code is taking that much
 MSmits: botting is a skill that takes a lot of time to learn, even if you're already a good coder
 MattSOrme: I put myself against aka. I wasn't expecting it to go well
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm fluctuating between 200th and 80th
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool
 BenjaminUrquhart: Stable Leaderboard:tm:
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462093924">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462093924</a>
 AntiSquid: 50 - 15- here BenjaminUrquhart
 AntiSquid: 150 *
 MattSOrme: woohoo
 MSmits: haha MattSOrme well done
 MattSOrme: i'll take it!
 MSmits: you get the wreck-Euler trophy: :trophy:
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'll join the club<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462094565">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462094565</a>
 NinjaDoggy: lol fix it!
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: hey NinjaDoggy long time no see
 AntiSquid: are you joining the contest?
 NinjaDoggy: yep
 NinjaDoggy: gonna make my bot decent today :D
 eulerscheZahl: and i see now way to really prevent that nonsense from happening
 eulerscheZahl: adding a lot of random noise to the game
 NinjaDoggy: first one is unlucky
 MattSOrme: i've got a few things planned to try, but yeah, rounding corners on a double is a pain
 NinjaDoggy: second one though :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: second is bad tracking, agreed
 Hjax: are we beating euler for fun now? I want to play <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462095728">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462095728</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but the first one is way more common
 MattSOrme: If i can beat euler, i def shouldn't be 400th
 eulerscheZahl: come on...did you get that in the first try Hjax?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl do you also still lose when you are being followed, meaning you know a dangerous pac is behind you?
 Hjax: 2nd try 
 MSmits: and then turn around a corner and forget him
 AntiSquid: euler to see mine check your battle history
 NinjaDoggy:  LOL
 eulerscheZahl: i still have very basic memory of previous turns
 NinjaDoggy: euler got lucky first and still got rekt :P
 AntiSquid: Hjax any top 10 replay is good :p
 MattSOrme: Hjax is aggressive. chased you down!
 MSmits: ah ok, thats on my list to fix... i still do that
 eulerscheZahl: there are some cases where i can tell where the opponent is with 100% certainty even without seeing it
 eulerscheZahl: but for the other cases&#160;:/
 MattSOrme: my bots are dumb enough to avoid your smarts
 MSmits: hmm you can tell only 1 turn cant you? After that you dont know what they do
 eulerscheZahl: i have another idea to fix that. but that's something for the last day
 eulerscheZahl: correct, i don't know usually
 eulerscheZahl: there are some corner cases
 eulerscheZahl: let me find the replay
 MSmits: pun intended?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461308137">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461308137</a>
 MSmits: frame?
 drykberg: hi there&#160;:) ... i just landed here and did the descent thing. Where do I start? :S
 eulerscheZahl: right at the start
 eulerscheZahl: top right corner
 drykberg: badly worded question
 drykberg: lel
 eulerscheZahl: i know that red starts there (symmetry)
 drykberg: hi im a retard, dont take me seriously
 eulerscheZahl: then opponent gains 0 score =&gt; probably SPEED
 eulerscheZahl: then gains 10 score, so it must be speed
 eulerscheZahl: and i can even tell the direction
 MSmits: oh nice
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a> drykberg
 eulerscheZahl: and that knowledge is enough for a kill already
 MSmits: so did you code a lot of heuristics for this or is it an actual search&#160;?
 drykberg: i was kinda under the impression there would be one big game here with many stages, getting increasingly hard... but now it seems there are many little coding challenges, is that right?
 eulerscheZahl: added the tracking today (the replay is old). my search knows where the opponent is for the first few turns
 AntiSquid: do the contest:  drykberg see link 
 drykberg: okee
 drykberg: thanks squid
 drykberg: or hater of squids
 MSmits: nice euler
 NinjaDoggy: hm...
 AntiSquid: drykberg it's this kind of squid:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkrQS7dCrFQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkrQS7dCrFQ</a>
 NinjaDoggy: cornering with 2 pacman for kill seems hard af
 drykberg: or anti linux squid?
 MSmits: lol AntiSquid, you will forever have to explain that
 BenjaminUrquhart: so uh
 BenjaminUrquhart: Hjax
 BenjaminUrquhart: that happened
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462100306">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462100306</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: your top pacs both turned into rock and got beat by my one paper
 Hjax: my bot is terrible lol 
 AntiSquid: maybe i need to change avatar to this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.bytebrothers.org/NoSquid.GIF">http://www.bytebrothers.org/NoSquid.GIF</a>
 Hjax: dont look at it 
 drykberg: its a trap, people wanna call u squid xD but no...
 drykberg: whatever, thanks for the tip
 Hjax: my bot does get some freak wins against top bots though: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462101280">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462101280</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: I beat kovi once but I lost the replay cause I was too focused on fixing a bug that appeared in it
 BenjaminUrquhart: (this was when kovi was #1)
 MattSOrme: in those trapped scenarios isn't it better to wait for the enemy to change, then you change to counter? rather than pre-countering?
 NinjaDoggy: it's better to not get trapped in the first place :P
 ChooJeremy: Wow BenjaminUrquhart that's amazing you turned to paper on a pac that's trapping 2 scissors and caught out a change to rock
 BenjaminUrquhart: ChooJeremy yes I noticed, don't applaud me cause it was a complete accident
 AntiSquid: there was one map where scissors was right at the end and enemy rock next to it, do you wait or do you change?
 MattSOrme: True but thats the trapped persons problem. Having 2 bots in a deadend, just makes it worse
 AntiSquid: the rock basically can speed and next turn take the kill
 AntiSquid: it's symmetrical, there's no other person's problem :p
 AntiSquid: it was right at the start
 Doju: Oh that was dumb...
 cegprakash: rocks and scissors can move fast than paper right because of their weight?
 BenjaminUrquhart: well yes but actually no
 ZarthaxX: u kidding right
 Doju: i've been running my vision and pathfinding on only the visible pellets
 Doju: while updating the grid and being all dumbfounded why my pacs couldn't find the pellets
 Kellthazar: Doju i consider unexplored cells too
 AntiSquid: yes 1 kg rock is heavier than 1kg paper
 Doju: Kellthazar yes so does my grid but my pacs didnt hahah
 Doju: now they do tho
 BenjaminUrquhart: found more bug
 BenjaminUrquhart: yay
 cegprakash: yay
 berries: i need a heuristic search dont i 
 BenjaminUrquhart: would be a good idea
 berries: also how can we keep track of where the pacman was the turn before
 AntiSquid: uhm .
 ChooJeremy: You need to save it in a variable somewhere and don't reset it
 AntiSquid: in an array&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or anything else
 berries: okay 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I just have a field in my pacman object that is set to the previous position whenever I update the current position
 berries: that makes sense
 BenjaminUrquhart:     public void updateLocation(Pair location) {
 eulerscheZahl: order matters
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, now i get what you are doing
 Doju: i store the whole location history
 Doju: works for 200 rounds
 Doju: maybe not smart if you're doing 2 million
 SemChumboPT: you know the starting point of your oponents and on first sight of one (counting the steps backwards) you can mark that space empty of pellets
 SemChumboPT: Also you can know their using speed at the start based on score analysis
 AntiSquid: akara-chudra 1 point above the 2nd, so does that mean he is better or just luck&#160;?
 MSmits: 1 point is not much in a game like this
 NapTown: SemChumboPT you don't know the exact path they took tho right? you couldn't mark them empty with 100% certainty
 MSmits: but it is *likely* he is similar or better, but not certain
 AntiSquid: 8 to 9 , 2 points difference
 MSmits: it depends on who submitted
 AntiSquid: oh wait just 1 nvm
 MSmits: my bot works especially well against people who maximize pellet collection and arent so aggressive... the top bots are like that. So my bot has a lot of trouble getting through the 20-40 ranks with all the killers, but once it is past that it does fine
 AntiSquid: so you optimized vs specific bots?
 MSmits: i dont have any code to prevent dying except the most basic stuff
 MSmits: no, thats just how my bot is
 SemChumboPT: Naptown only on very begging on first site, maybe step 5 or 6, because it would impossible for them to went other way
 MSmits: it is good at getting a lot of pellets but nothing else
 MSmits: so if the opponent doesnt hunt me i am fine
 cegprakash: 4048 ppl in leaderboard already.. can we hit 5000?
 NapTown: SemChumboPT right
 AntiSquid: just want to see this contest beat even the accountant, despite the forced submits
 MSmits: once i get rid of some of these preventable deaths i should see some improvements
 SemChumboPT: But I have problems already just keeping up qith my Pacs&#160;:)
 MSmits: its not an easy contest for sure... i think most people hit a wall pretty quickly
 MSmits: pun intended
 NapTown: SemChumboPT instead of marking them empty or unknown, i was thinking of doing a probability of pellet from 0 to 1, but i don't know if i feel like it lol
 Counterbalance: ur so punny&#160;;)
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i still have a large TODO MSmits and my mood is inversely proportionally to the size of the TODO
 NinjaDoggy: aww shoot
 MSmits: same AntiSquid
 SemChumboPT: Right now i lack the ability to search for paths so I just printed the idea out for you guys programmers&#160;:)
 MSmits: I have to code more this week than I actually feel like doing, just to get the list done. 
 SemChumboPT: i'm more a 1600th in bronze league programmer
 AntiSquid: you don't have to
 MSmits: sure&#160;:)
 MSmits: share anything you want
 AntiSquid: talking to SemChumboPT
 BenWo: yeah sitting middle of bronze league is stretching my knowledge already
 MSmits: me too
 sunksuperset370: how do we make a move
 sunksuperset370: i am really confused
 BenjaminUrquhart: It's in the statement
 sunksuperset370: i am trying to put in the x and the y position in the code
 BenjaminUrquhart: MOVE id x y
 sunksuperset370: but its not working
 AntiSquid: i mean you can easily go beyond bronze i am sure, if you try SemChumboPT
 SemChumboPT: I'll try...
 sunksuperset370: i also put in the id then the x position then the y postion
 sunksuperset370: i can't work it out
 sunksuperset370: can anyone help
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 BenWo: sunksuperset370 - you need to do a "print MOVE pac_id x y" 
 BenWo: what language you working in?
 sunksuperset370: javascript
 BenjaminUrquhart: console.log("MOVE id x y")
 Counterbalance: noooo
 BenjaminUrquhart: k flame me
 sunksuperset370: do i have to right it in a string form
 Counterbalance: oww they changed it
 Counterbalance: wow
 sunksuperset370: or variable form
 BenWo: yeah the command has to be a string
 sunksuperset370: ok thanks
 sunksuperset370: but how do you know which position to go to
 sunksuperset370: it only shows me the postion when i play the code
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's for you to figure out&#160;;)
 BenWo: it also sends you a list of all of the pellets
 BenjaminUrquhart: easy start is to select the nearest pellet
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i will try
 VicHofs: why would you not select the nearest pellet
 VicHofs: I couldn't think of a reason
 BenjaminUrquhart: hyper-aggressive bot that kills others
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset370 you could make a code that goes to a random power pellet
 sunksuperset370: i mean i can't figure out where is the nearest pallete
 Doju: VicHofs if there's a path that will lead to more pellets in the long term
 njaber: I found the Keybindings in the option, is there a way to bind launching our code?
 sunksuperset370: the starter code i am given doesn't make any sense
 VicHofs: how tf do you implement that lol @Doju
 sunksuperset370: the code doesn't have any x or y variables to start with
 Doju: VicHofs the search things that the top guys are doing
 sunksuperset370: it's all confusing
 VicHofs: I'm already running BFS for nearest pellets and timing out sometimes
 Doju: VicHofs and actually i'm gonna do a different thing that might lead to a similar result
 njaber: VicHofs that's the point of the challenge&#160;;)
 VicHofs: how
 Adnmaster: it gives you input and you have to extract the data from the input
 sunksuperset370: ok i will try thanks
 TheTwister: Guys my code gone save if I just close the browser?
 VicHofs: @njaber ye but idk how lol
 Doju: are you sure that you're timing out because of the bfs?
 VicHofs: probably Doju
 BenWo: TheTwister - not if you submit
 sunksuperset370: i am new to coding so that's why its confusing
 VicHofs: when I remove it and set to random choice it doesn
 VicHofs: 't
 TheTwister: @BenWo ty
 VicHofs: time out
 sunksuperset370: i thought if i enter a contest it might help me get better
 BenWo: I mean, it saves if you submit... 
 TheTwister: lol
 Doju: VicHofs and are you using it the sensible way aka flooding till you find a pellet
 VicHofs: yes
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset370 search this in google: hackerrank, codewars, 
 BenjaminUrquhart: Doju join the silver gang
 VicHofs: if by flooding you mean using BFS and breaking when a pellet is found
 Doju: BenjaminUrquhart i'm working on it
 Doju: I need some logic for not committing suicide and not grouping up too much and i think im good
 sunksuperset370: i can't search that
 sunksuperset370: i am using a school chromebook
 sunksuperset370: its blocked for me
 Adnmaster: why?
 Doju: lol
 Adnmaster: oh
 sunksuperset370: i am a student from a school
 BenjaminUrquhart: why does your school block google
 sunksuperset370: i can't buy a laptop to do this on
 BenjaminUrquhart: :thinking:
 sunksuperset370: no the term hacker is blocked to search
 BenWo: lol
 Adnmaster: you can play clash of code on codingame?
 BenjaminUrquhart: lame
 VicHofs: what the heck
 BenWo: codewars is still good though
 llllllllll: tfw you spend ~30 min if your life to add emojis to your actions in order to ease debugging <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462127854">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462127854</a>
 Doju: thats amazing
 sunksuperset370: isn't clash of code ended
 Doju: im gonna steal your idea
 Doju: thanks bye
 BenjaminUrquhart: TIL cg viewer supports emoji
 NinjaDoggy: lol same
 BenWo: I didn't know that was possible
 BenWo: thank you
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset370 no, you can always play it when you want
 SamuelTheBad: that's pretty good
 njaber: That's so cool
 llllllllll: haha, welcome
 Doju: whatever the question is
 sunksuperset370: um ok
 Doju: emoji is always the answer
 Doju: or maybe 42
 njaber: Hey I'm from that school
 njaber: Doju
 Adnmaster: how much do you know coding? sunksuperset370
 sunksuperset370: barely much
 sunksuperset370: i am new to coding
 Doju: njaber not the school but the answer to the life, universe and everything
 sunksuperset370: i started taking online lessons about a month ago
 BenWo: sunksuperset370 - is there a reason you chose javascript?
 Doju: i cant english again
 Doju: life, the universe and everything*
 njaber: Doju I know I was just joking
 sunksuperset370: yes its the easiest and fun language to learn
 sunksuperset370: other ones are confusing
 njaber: Are there Keybindings/way to add keybindings for "Play my code" and/or "Replay in same conditions"?
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset it would be better if you learned python3, its an easier language
 BenWo: I agree, using this to learn Python better myself
 Adnmaster: javascript is used for web
 njaber: js can be used for many things, I personally find js mroe practical then python in many situations
 sunksuperset370: wait then which language is used for making programs like apps or games
 sunksuperset370: same
 zams: sunksuperset what other languages have you tried before?
 sunksuperset370: none
 SemChumboPT: I'm doing this in PHP&#160;:)
 njaber: for games it usually things like Java/C#/Cpp
 njaber: C++*
 SemChumboPT: it's the only one i know
 sunksuperset370: heard that java script was used for a lot of thing
 sunksuperset370: *things
 AntiSquid: "was"&#160;?
 SemChumboPT: but i sow a video linked that a guy was doing it on Python, maybe it's a good start to learn 
 sunksuperset370: *is
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset370 C# are used for applications, and you can use many other languages for apps but if you're new to coding it would be best for you if you learn easy programming languages like python3
 Adnmaster: and to use javascript you need to know html and css, too
 sunksuperset370: woah
 njaber: Adnmaster that's not tru, you can do NodeJS and don't need any knowledge of html/css
 gbiebuyc: nodejs
 sunksuperset370: so now i have to learn python3 to compete in this competition
 Adnmaster: hmm...
 sunksuperset370: make me think
 gbiebuyc: JS is fine
 njaber: sunksuperset370 if you can manage js don't change, python is slower anyways
 SemChumboPT: there are plenty of options.... good thing Codingame accepts them all&#160;!!!!
 Wolisunde: while that is technically true, I'd recommend python or c#, or java if you already know some 
 Adnmaster: njaber what is nodejs?
 Wolisunde: for new coders
 sunksuperset370: heard about node js
 sunksuperset370: wait node is like a terminal thing
 sunksuperset370: not a language
 shashwat986: Adnmaster it's basically a framework for javascript
 njaber: Adnmaster an engine that runtime environement for JS that isn't linked to browsers
 jjdb210: How are people labling their pacs?
 Adnmaster: ok
 Adnmaster: nice, ill look that up
 Wolisunde: ^
 sunksuperset370: yep i need answer to that too
 ChooJeremy: jjdb210 you can print a string after the command to label it
 sunksuperset370: how are they labling their pacs?
 ChooJeremy: like MOVE 0 27 10 LABEL
 njaber: add the text you want to appear abovev the pacs after the command you send them
 jjdb210: That should be in the documentation
 njaber: it is
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset370, if you want you can keep coding javascript, codingame accepts it. My opinion is python3, but the choice is yours
 njaber: wait
 sunksuperset370: ok thanks
 sunksuperset370: but what should i do
 sunksuperset370: now
 njaber: I though I saw it in the documentation
 Adnmaster: you can keep coding javascript
 Wolisunde: start with python
 jjdb210: I don't see it under OUTPUT (which is where i would expect it... but thank you
 AntiSquid: lol i started with JS 
 Wolisunde: or if you already know javascript, stick to what you know
 Counterbalance: njaber it's under the debugging tips
 sunksuperset370: all the variables are inside other loops, and its telling me to print it outside the loops
 jjdb210: ah yes, i see it ther enow
 jjdb210: thank you
 AntiSquid: well python long time ago, but never used python since highschool
 sunksuperset370: this wouldn't work
 AntiSquid: i mean pascal * not python
 AntiSquid: i did use python more recently lol
 ChooJeremy: No you print it inside the loop
 ChooJeremy: cause each loop represents a turn
 sunksuperset370: ok let me try that
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset370, the program gives you input like the x and y locations of your pack, and you need to print an output for example: console.log("MOVE 0 10 10")
 sunksuperset370: can't believe i was that dum
 AntiSquid: any language is fine really
 AntiSquid: when you start
 sunksuperset370: i can't find the position of the pac
 sunksuperset370: how am i supposed to know where to move
 BenWo: not dumb, just needed to learn the basic code structure the site expects
 Ramzel: I m on the second place in wood 1 league will i got promoted?
 Wolisunde: look under game input in the directions
 MSmits: you need to be 1st Ramzel
 Adnmaster: you can see the statement thats under the screen for details sunksuperset370
 MSmits: above boss
 shashwat986: See? this is what happens with me: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462134545">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462134545</a>

 MSmits: thats the only reason the boss is there
 sunksuperset370: where are the detaild
 sunksuperset370: it only tells me the summary of the turn
 Quidome: wow 4k submitters :D
 sunksuperset370: not the details befor the trun starts
 shashwat986: I time out in the actual ladder, and my same bot plays when I copy to IDE
 jrke: hey shashwat
 shashwat986: eulerscheZahl ^ vs you
 shashwat986: hey jrke
 Adnmaster: if you scroll down the summary you can see it sunksuperset370
 sunksuperset370: i am scrolling
 sunksuperset370: only see game summary
 sunksuperset370: nothing else
 Adnmaster: are you sure?
 sunksuperset370: only player has pacs standing
 sunksuperset370: player wins with 331 pellets
 sunksuperset370: thats all i see
 Adnmaster: oh, not that
 sunksuperset370: then what
 Adnmaster: don't scroll down the console output, scroll down the screen
 sunksuperset370: wait the game schreen
 Adnmaster: have you found it?
 sunksuperset370: the pac id is always 0 in this league
 sunksuperset370: constraints
 Adnmaster: yes, because there is only one pac
 sunksuperset370: not there are two
 sunksuperset370: blue and red
 BenWo: right, both have id=0
 Adnmaster: that is your opponet
 sunksuperset370: then which one am i suppoed to move
 BenWo: but yours has mine=1
 Ramzel: Yey welcome Bronze
 SabertheLost: Question, if pacman moves two steps in one turn. Does he see all pebeels he passed+
 MSmits: well done Ramzel
 Adnmaster: console.log("MOVE 0 10 10"), this will move pac with (id=0) to x:10 y:10
 sunksuperset370: isn't a string used with <i></i>
 sunksuperset370: rather than ""
 ChooJeremy: Saber pretty sure it doesn't
 Adnmaster: well use which one you like
 Adnmaster: it can be different in javascript than python
 sunksuperset370: so now my pac moved
 sunksuperset370: but how do i know to move at a different place
 BenWo: :thumbsup:
 Adnmaster: you can change 10's
 sunksuperset370: and how am i&#160;?
 Adnmaster:&#160;?
 Doju: is it bad to access an instance variable with a method?
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 sunksuperset370: what 
 sunksuperset370: am i supposed to do
 Doju: like i have a dict called dist with distances to all other cells
 Adnmaster: console.log("MOVE 0 20 20")
 Adnmaster: this will make the pac move to x:20 y:20
 sunksuperset370: yes
 sunksuperset370: then waht
 BenWo: Doju - within the same class?
 Adnmaster: if you're new to coding i think it will be better for you to train before this contest
 Doju: do i have to call it with  cell.dist[other_cell] or is it ok to have a function called get_dist that returns self.dist[other_cell]
 Doju: BenWo yes
 AntiSquid: lol and miss the contest? imo contest helps the most
 sunksuperset370: the board is ramdom all the time
 Doju: indeed
 Adnmaster: thats there to prevent cheat
 sunksuperset370: thn what i a suppoed to do
 eulerscheZahl: shashwat986 08:08PM<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462135587">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462135587</a>
 AntiSquid: hardcoding *
 BenWo: Doju I think either way is fine, I usually find having a "getter" can be useful
 AntiSquid: which isn't cheating
 Adnmaster: yeah whatever they're all the same :D
 MonZtaDeluxe: you have to implement Keyboard Controls, then you can control your pacman with the arrow keys
 sunksuperset370: what am i suppoed to do?
 sunksuperset370: i don't find anything
 AntiSquid: how is hardcoding cheating? lol
 sunksuperset370: i am wood league 2 at the start somehow
 Doju: sunksuperset370 MonZtaDeluxe is messing with you
 Doju: yu can't control your pac yourself
 BenWo: sunks - this is where I generate my output for a bot:' '.join(["MOVE", str(self._id), *[str(_) for _ in self.get_dest()]])
 Adnmaster: you need to make calculations and give the pac x and y
 Kellthazar: Oh... discover a silly bug on my code.
 sunksuperset370: and how do i do tha
 sunksuperset370: how make calculations
 Adnmaster: you need to know that
 sunksuperset370: as told earlier i am new to coding
 sunksuperset370: so that is something that i don't know
 sunksuperset370: like where do i find the information where to move
 Kellthazar: Hahah
 Adnmaster: you need to learn it to make code in this competition
 Kellthazar: You need to learn then :D
 sunksuperset370: and where do i learn that
 Doju: here.
 BenWo: I think that kind of question is suited for youtube tutorials and such
 Adnmaster: wait...
 MonZtaDeluxe: i think you can learn coding in the internet
 Adnmaster: what was the name of that learn platform again...
 sunksuperset370: js
 MonZtaDeluxe: Adnmaster i think it's called internet
 sunksuperset370: good one
 SomePersonFromMars: +1
 Kellthazar: A channel that I recommended for begginers is Coding Train
 Adnmaster: :sweat_smile:
 Kellthazar: by Daniel Shiffman
 CTRL-ALT-D3L: codecademy as well
 ChooJeremy: Isn't codingame supposed to be a learning platform?
 Adnmaster: got it: udemy
 sunksuperset370: i learned at codecademy
 ChooJeremy: Starting with the easy challenges and move upwards
 Adnmaster: you can use udemy
 BenWo: spoilers, but might be quickest start for here -&gt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=codingame+javascript">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=codingame+javascript</a>
 sunksuperset370: but how do i know hwere to move to if i don't know the board
 BenWo: that's kind of a huge question
 sunksuperset370: please help for the sake of humanity
 BenWo: it depends on your strategy
 Adnmaster: it gives you the information of the board as row variable
 MonZtaDeluxe: read the description
 sunksuperset370: whrer are those
 MonZtaDeluxe: below the screen
 MonZtaDeluxe: on the left side
 Adnmaster: if i give him a function i made, is that cheating?
 Doju: sunksuperset370 i'd say just go for a random pellet or closest pellet for starters
 Wolisunde: i don't think it much matters @Adnmaster
 BenWo: Adnmaster - I don't personally care, I don't know how helpful it would be
 sunksuperset370: all positions are filled with palets
 Adnmaster: def isWall(wid, hei, list1): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/67f1b2e6-99f4-43d4-a17e-9c070b2b5da1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/67f1b2e6-99f4-43d4-a17e-9c070b2b5da1</a>
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: didnt work anyway
 BenWo: it worked, it auto-pastebinned it
 Adnmaster: oh wait it did
 Adnmaster: ok
 sunksuperset370: let me try
 drykberg: is it somewhere broken down, what strategies/logic people use in each tier&#160;?
 Adnmaster: wait dont use that, its python3
 sunksuperset370: where do i have to paste it at
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Adnmaster: at the beginning, but thats for python
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: what do i do
 BenWo: @sunksuperset370 - check out the youtube link I pasted 
 sunksuperset370: that is a search link
 sunksuperset370: its not a youtube video
 BenWo: with every result being a tutorial about how to use javascript on this website to solve a puzzle
 Wolisunde: this is the first competition of this style I've done before. How much of the code am I allowed to change?
 Counterbalance: all of it, Wolisunde
 Wolisunde: :D
 Adnmaster: sunksuperset370 you can watch videos about this competition in youtube
 sunksuperset370: i don't think so
 Bastett: well, leave Main in place (or equiv for various languages)
 Doju: Wolisunde that's such an innocent question haha :D
 Adnmaster: why not
 sunksuperset370: restriction mode is activated
 sunksuperset370: like parental lock
 Adnmaster: oh
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 drykberg: do i need to know pathfinding algo to do this well?
 sunksuperset370: sucks to be me
 Wolisunde: @drykberg not at first
 BenWo: drykberg - depending on how well you consider "well"
 Wolisunde: at the highest levels, you'll be facing people who do know these things, though
 sunksuperset370: does anyone here have the app zoom
 sunksuperset370: zoo
 ChooJeremy: Basic BFS is probably good enough to get you to silver at least
 sunksuperset370: zoom
 Adnmaster: i have
 drykberg: okay thank you
 sunksuperset370: zoom?
 Doju: ChooJeremy i don't think so
 Doju: Except if you also do other things
 VicHofs: ChooJeremy def not
 sunksuperset370: adnmaster do you have zoom?
 BenWo: yeah not BFS alone
 Adnmaster: yes sunksuperset370
 Doju: i've got some more than basic bfs and i'm 572 in bronze
 sunksuperset370: ok i will give you the link and enter the meeting
 ChooJeremy: Oh true that's fair
 Adnmaster: ok?
 VicHofs: grrr I keep timing out for no reason whatsoever
 VicHofs: lmao
 Doju: but i have absolutely 0 consideration for the enemy
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://zoom.us/j/2819809238?pwd=ZlI4dnNGNFI0dFRBZk51N3BOTllVdz09">https://zoom.us/j/2819809238?pwd=ZlI4dnNGNFI0dFRBZk51N3BOTllVdz09</a>
 VicHofs: anyone else getting this?
 sunksuperset370: this is the link
 Doju: or any other pacs, for that matter
 Kellthazar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462154600">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462154600</a>
 BenWo: haha
 ShannonNorris97: Do you not even do switch when there's an enemy near you yet Doju?
 BenWo: Doju - I ended up just making my pathing consider my own pacs to be a wall 
 Kellthazar: is dbdr bot broken?
 Doju: ShannonNorris97 I just spam speed all the time
 sunksuperset370: adnmaster you are muted
 ShannonNorris97: Oh wow - that's interesting. Your algorithm must be much better than mine for the other aspects then because we're quite close on the leaderboard and I have been taking them into account
 ShannonNorris97: My route finding isn't great though
 ShannonNorris97: *pellet finding
 RockyMullet: 99% of the time speed is better
 eulerscheZahl: Kellthazar he uses Rust. it has release mode on submit but debug mode in the IDE
 VicHofs: how many ms does your BFS take Doju
 eulerscheZahl: so he's likely to timeout
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/FAQ">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/FAQ</a>
 RockyMullet: me I switch only if I 1 cell away from an enemy who can eat me, or if I catch an enemy in a dead end
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: saw that link coming
 Doju: VicHofs from every cell to every other cell around 125 ms on a medium map
 Doju: with 0 optimization
 PatrickMcGinnisII: iswall(*b,x,y) { return (b[y][x]==NULL?0:(b[y][x]=='#'?1:0));}
 PatrickMcGinnisII: does this work?
 eulerscheZahl: next: how to set a seed?
 VicHofs: holy shit @Doju
 dbdr: next FAQ?
 eulerscheZahl: yes =&gt; turn on expert mode
 dbdr: how to mesure time
 Doju: VicHofs you're just have something wrong in your code
 eulerscheZahl: that too
 RockyMullet: not sure why its even an option
 dbdr: broken inputs on CSB
 Doju: it shouldn't be taking a second
 Counterbalance: precomputed 36481 distances in 934 μs 
 BenWo: hey Doju - seems you might now, what's the best way to get the ms elapsed back from CG?
 VicHofs: it doesn't tho that's the weird thing @Doju
 VicHofs: it only times out here
 VicHofs: If I try it on a different IDE with a map sim it works
 eulerscheZahl: BenWo depends on your langauge
 BenWo: python
 Kellthazar: eulerscheZahl thanks
 Kellthazar: I like Rust
 Doju: BenWo I'm just taking time.process_time() for the start and end in python
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/measure-time-elapsed-in-python">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7370801/measure-time-elapsed-in-python</a>
 Kellthazar: The Nannou framework is amazing
 dbdr:&#160;:) 3 hungarian flags in top 10, Kovi T1024 :flag_hu:
 BenWo: gotcha, thanks guys
 Doju: VicHofs that's probably because your own pc is faster than the server
 dbdr: Csipcsirip come join us&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and top8 all with 33.xx score
 eulerscheZahl: so close
 dbdr: yeah
 VicHofs: huh yeah maybe @Doju
 MonZtaDeluxe: that moment when pathfinding works like a charm &lt;3
 Hjax: last time i measured my pc was about 5x faster than the server 
 VicHofs: how do I do the pastebin thing
 Hjax: the server is not particularly fast 
 eulerscheZahl: many lines turn into a pastebin here
 VicHofs: I wanna get a second opinion if yall dont mind
 Doju: umm
 Doju: dont send lots of code
 VicHofs: no in pseudocode
 Hjax: if you send lots of code it gets converted to a pastebin link 
 Doju: alright
 dbdr: did someone ever paste a legend bot in the chat by accident?
 Hjax: that would be amusing, i doubt it 
 eulerscheZahl: once i was close to accidentally PMing to to MK :D
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to click the editor, hit his avatar
 Doju: lol
 dbdr: i think we've all been close :D
 Hjax: Jirotech has broken the 33 barrier, 34.01 now 
 dbdr: especially as there used to be a big that moved the focus to the chat by itself
 Hjax: Jirotech is the best against kovi confirmed 
 dbdr: haven't seen it for some time, must be fixed
 dbdr: *a bug
 eulerscheZahl: i sometimes managed to open a leaderboard, search for a user and hit enter
 eulerscheZahl: focus changed to chat
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i also wanted to PM a user on his profile. then something else loaded, shifting everything. so i unfollowed :D
 Hjax: wow what a jerk euler, unfollowing people :P 
 dbdr: as long as it's not "delete your account" without confirmation...
 Hjax: that only happens if youre name is struct 
 eulerscheZahl: there is a confirmation but no captcha
 Hjax: your* 
 eulerscheZahl: surprisingly easy to delete
 dbdr: kovi shuffled things around again&#160;:)
 dbdr: now top5 is close&#160;:)
 Doju: Oh wait, can you not give getters extra arguments?
 Hjax: kovi is trying really hard to make the leaderboard meaningless 
 Doju: it's throwing an error&#160;:/
 Hjax: someone should show him cgbenchmark so he stops submitting 
 eulerscheZahl: he knows that tool
 eulerscheZahl: we had the discussion on ocean of code
 Hjax: he just doesnt want to use it? 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't use it either
 Hjax: i didnt use it in utg, i might use it for this contest 
 Hjax: i usually just do lots of self play against previous version of my bot, runs much faster than games on the server 
 ChooJeremy: first time I've heard of cgbenchmark
 Hjax: running 3 games simultaneously on my desktop, i can run 1000 test games in like 30 minutes 
 ChooJeremy: Determine what the best value of constants should be?
 Doju: Oh i need to do that...
 Hjax: ChooJeremy no its a tool that runs test games against bots and collects results 
 VicHofs: I can share pseudocode right
 Counterbalance: and small snippets
 VicHofs: sickc
 Doju: sicc
 VicHofs: is this ineffective at all?
 VicHofs: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b6e4f892-9c06-4383-a723-5ccc82bb4ed0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b6e4f892-9c06-4383-a723-5ccc82bb4ed0</a>
 Hjax: youd think my 6 core 12 thread machine could run more than 3 games simultaneously , but that maxes out the cpu 
 ChooJeremy: Hjax right so that seems like determining the value of constants would be one of it's use cases?
 ChooJeremy: Like provide multiple different codes with say DECAY = 0.9, 0.8, 0.7 and test them all
 Hjax: you could do that yes 
 VicHofs: I can run this BFS real quick on my PC but idk about the servers so I need a second opinion
 VicHofs: and I keep timing out so...
 Kellthazar: Yesterday I tried to run my code in debug mode using the Refereer.
 Hjax: bfs with python is going to be a bit painful i think 
 Hjax: 50 ms is not a lot time in the land of python 
 Doju: Hjax nope
 VicHofs: Doju's on the same boat that's why I'm asking his opinion
 Doju: Hjax well if you do every cell to every other cell on every move then maybe
 Hjax: every cell to every other cell will eat your time in any language 
 Kellthazar: VicHofs, its better to calc all the paths before the game loop
 VicHofs: huh Kellthazar
 Hjax: even if you abuse the symmetry to speed it up, takes me about 90 ms in java on the server 
 Doju: VicHofs the thing is
 VicHofs: like having all the combinations ready and just testing them?
 Hjax: (i dont abuse symmetry though, so i could do it in 45 if i did) 
 Doju: that goes from a cell to a target cell
 Kellthazar: Yeah... Flood Fill BFS, I learned that lesson days ago
 Doju: you don't really need that
 DragonJ: dude I beat the boss and still am in the same league
 VicHofs: Doju wym
 Hjax: DragonJ you need to be higher ranked than the boss, not just win a game against it 
 VicHofs: DragonJ you gotta rank higher
 Doju: VicHofs you want to start from a specific cell and end in any cell that fits some criteria (for example it's a pellet if you want to find the nearest pellet)
 Doju: because what i image you're doing now is
 Kellthazar: Use a map to store all the pre computed data: Map&lt;Point, Map&lt;Point, Path&gt;&gt;
 Doju: for every pellet you run that bfs function
 Doju: and take the closest one
 VicHofs: I'm confused isn't that the same thing you just sasid
 VicHofs: *said
 Doju: it's not
 Doju: but so what is the goal that you're trying to achieve?
 Doju: is it finding the closest pellet?
 VicHofs: my BFS works like this
 VicHofs: yes
 Doju: so you run that for every known pellet?
 VicHofs: it starts the sweep from the pac's location
 VicHofs: no
 Doju: oh
 VicHofs: I run it for each pac
 VicHofs: it breaks when I find a pellet
 VicHofs: close to the pac in question
 Doju: oh yeah right i misread your pseudocode
 VicHofs: that's why I don't understand the timeouts
 VicHofs: on my pc max I've gotten was idk 30ms?
 VicHofs: And that's with no limits
 Doju: maybe it's the string concatenation?
 Doju: or in general just working with strings
 Doju: why don't you profile that locally?
 VicHofs: I thought maybe it was but then I looked up the std runtime and it just wouldn't make sense from what I've seen
 BenWo: woo, my pacs are battling :D
 Doju: uhh but seriously that's waaayy too slow
 Doju: when i used that it ran in like 1 or 2 ms per pac
 Doju: with little optimization
 VicHofs: when you used your BFS implementation u mean?
 Doju: when i used my bfs implementation similar to that one
 VicHofs: similar how, with strings?
 Doju: atm i'm precalculating all the distances
 Doju: so basically doing that but with no end condition except exhausting the queue
 Doju: and saving the distances
 VicHofs: what the heck lol
 Doju: for every cell to every cell
 VicHofs: I tried doing that a while ago and it was a timeout for suure
 Doju: with 0 optimization and it runs in 125 ms
 VicHofs: doesn't that timeout too tho?
 Doju: only in the start
 Doju: not on every move
 Doju: although if you optimize it you can get it running in stupidly fast times
 VicHofs: but how do you know where to go during the game?
 WillNess: can pacs wrap around the map vertically and horizontally?
 VicHofs: only horizontally WillNess
 BenWo: My current submit is running BFS for 4 pacs in 0.5ms
 Doju: like somebody here did that in like 60 us or something
 VicHofs: BenWo -_-
 Doju: VicHofs i go through the precalculated distances and get the smallest one
 Counterbalance: VicHofs your bfs looks a bit odd to me; it should look more like this:
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e036790-d69c-442c-a8da-7518fba529b8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e036790-d69c-442c-a8da-7518fba529b8</a>
 VicHofs: but only at the start of the game?
 Doju: VicHofs i calculate the distances at the start of the game and go through them on every move
 VicHofs: hm @Counterbalance
 Doju: Isn't Vic's basically doing that though?
 VicHofs: Doju but how do you account for changes in the pellets then
 MattSOrme: why can i beat top 10, but still place 400th?&#160;:/ 
 VicHofs: MattSOrme probably luck
 BenWo: because you can't beat top 400?
 Doju: VicHofs i look up the distances between the pac and all the known pellets and pick the smallest one
 MattSOrme: BenWo thats just mean... but also apparently true
 Doju: WAAIIT
 Doju: VicHofs the visited set should be outside of the loop
 VicHofs: is it not?
 Doju: VicHofs i just explained lol
 VicHofs: oh shit
 Doju: oh oops
 Doju: read your old message
 muy31: YEah! just finished my AP CAlc BC exam!
 cegprakash: #fr
 Doju: gratz muy31
 VicHofs: cool muy31
 muy31: thanks
 Doju: i also got my matriculation exams results today
 VicHofs: cegprakash oui oui mon ami
 cegprakash: just trying to spy in :D
 cegprakash: ignore me
 cegprakash: I don't know French
 Doju: lol
 VicHofs: oui kashikomarimashita understood
 VicHofs: no srsly tho lol
 Doju: whaaat
 Doju: is l'argent also silver?
 VicHofs: I can't figure out the timeouts
 Doju: in addition to money?
 VicHofs: argent means silver
 VicHofs: in french yes
 VicHofs: money too
 Doju: huh. the more you know
 VicHofs: why do you think the periodic symbol for silver is Ag?&#160;;)
 Doju: because latin
 eulerscheZahl: Ag = argentum in the periodic table
 Doju: and not french
 Doju: wati what?
 muy31: si
 cegprakash: #Ag
 Doju: yeah latin
 Kellthazar: Argentina... Land of Argentum
 cegprakash: #Hu
 VicHofs: yeah think what you will
 Doju: but VicHofs anyway
 VicHofs: yall KNOW Mendeleev was a Croissant Addict
 cegprakash: what is channel for Hungary
 cegprakash: #Hg
 muy31: Mercury
 VicHofs: yeah Doju
 Doju: you are timing out because your visited set gets emptied on every loop
 sunksuperset370: so i had a question
 sunksuperset370: do we have to use node to calculate the information
 VicHofs: I think I sent you the wrong one maybe Doju
 VicHofs: cause its not here
 Doju: if that's actually what your code is doing and not just a mistake in the pseudocode
 cegprakash: there's no spoiler on France chat
 Kellthazar: sunkusiperset370, node? Like nodejs?
 cegprakash: #Ro
 Kellthazar: #Br
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 VicHofs: no
 VicHofs: of course not lmao
 VicHofs: I'd be F'd big timme
 sunksuperset370: then how do you calculate the information
 Doju: lol there's your bug 
 VicHofs: you just take the input from the file
 VicHofs: sunksuperset370 what language are you using
 Kellthazar: Your code should do that
 sunksuperset370: js
 Kellthazar: In the language of your choose. The Codingame API will run the code for you.
 Doju: Vic is the visited set outside the loop?
 sunksuperset370: i have a default code there
 cegprakash: #HU
 VicHofs: yep Doju
 VicHofs: I think I'm gonna try and refresh if I can't figure it out cause
 cegprakash: #HUN
 sunksuperset370: so how do i know what the information is before i starte the turn
 VicHofs: I can't figure out shit
 VicHofs: lmao
 sunksuperset370: neither can i
 Doju: also where's your queue?
 VicHofs: sunksuperset370 sweet we're one and the same then
 VicHofs: Doju outside too
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 VicHofs: 'cause I can't figure shit out either&#160;:)
 sunksuperset370: am i outside?
 BenWo: well, bronze 190, higher than I thought I'd get!
 VicHofs: no lmao
 sunksuperset370: then what
 VicHofs: @sunksuperset370 I mean we're both stuck my dude
 sunksuperset370: yep
 VicHofs: that is it
 Doju: I think i have to start implementing probabilities now
 VicHofs: gee
 BenWo: I need to start prioritizing the super pellets
 Doju: or should i do combat first?
 kovi: ok, i managed 3x34 all hungarian
 VicHofs: honest opinion
 VicHofs: combat
 VicHofs: ol
 VicHofs: lol
 BenWo: Doju - I'd say combat will give you more benefit
 sunksuperset370: how do i know what the information is if i can't see it
 Doju: Ok i'll do that, thanks VicHofs and BenWo
 Doju: or at least i'll try to make them not commit suicide
 BenWo: at least enough to be defensive
 BenWo: lol right and that
 VicHofs: roll down the window with the game sunksuperset370
 VicHofs: the info's laid out there
 sunksuperset370: ok i know about that
 VicHofs: it's using an input() function or an equivalent
 sunksuperset370: how do i change a move after one move
 sunksuperset370: like the target cordinate after the pac is there
 BenWo: sunksuperset370 - use variables 
 sunksuperset370: can the pac detect palets
 sunksuperset370: if so that would be helpful
 VicHofs: yes try implementing BFS
 sunksuperset370: BFS?
 Astrobytes: You are given visible pellets in the input
 sunksuperset370: ok
 BenWo: yes - you can code it to detect pellets
 VicHofs: it's short and sweet and not as annoying as A*
 sunksuperset370: lol
 sunksuperset370: lol
 BenWo: BFS = Breadth first search
 Astrobytes: A pac can only see those pellets in direct line of sight
 Doju: no
 VicHofs: @sunksuperset370 Breadth First Search look it up
 Doju: sunksuperset370 don't do bfs
 Doju: if you're completely new to coding
 muy31: no do it
 Counterbalance: sunksuperset370 you might want to try this one first, it shows you the basics of how these types of games work:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding</a> 
 VicHofs: is he new tho
 Doju: yes
 VicHofs: sheeit
 VicHofs: then yeah don't lol
 sunksuperset370: dude onboard is easy
 VicHofs: you'll just be more confused maybe
 sunksuperset370: this was the first one finished in 1 min
 Doju: okay so i'd say
 VicHofs: @sunksuperset370 damn aight
 VicHofs: okay my doggie
 sunksuperset370: F*** u
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 VicHofs: what
 sunksuperset370: didn't mean that
 VicHofs: okay...
 sunksuperset370: you called me doggie
 Doju: a solid start would be to find the closest pellet using manhattan distance
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 muy31: sunksuperset370 ther you go
 sunksuperset370: didn't mean
 sunksuperset370: it
 Doju: sunksuperset370
 VicHofs: doggie isn't an insult lol
 Astrobytes: Accidentally typing insults :thinking:
 muy31: VicHofs it is
 sunksuperset370: the word doggie just makes me feel unconfortable
 VicHofs: must be some weird american thing
 cegprakash: I have added 6 TODOs for today
 cegprakash: :D
 sunksuperset370: sorry should have told you that earlier
 cegprakash: 2 of them improves performance
 VicHofs: in the UK it aint
 sunksuperset370: i am not amerian
 sunksuperset370: I am living in america but
 VicHofs: where u from bro
 sunksuperset370: i was bored in india
 sunksuperset370: Asia
 Doju: sunksuperset370 i'd recommend you to find the closest pellet using manhattan distance
 VicHofs: oh ok
 Doju: for starters
 VicHofs: yeah try what Doju siad sunksuperset370
 VicHofs: *said
 sunksuperset370: how do you find manhattan distance
 BenWo: google
 muy31: just x1-x2 = y1-y2
 muy31: +
 muy31: not equals
 Doju: absolute of those
 muy31: yah
 Doju: abs(x1-x2) + abs(y1-y2)
 BenWo: not considering tunnels&#160;;)
 Doju: don't consider them.
 sunksuperset370: uummmmm
 sunksuperset370: you guys just made it confusing
 VicHofs: look it up if u need to
 muy31: algebra
 VicHofs: it's simple
 sunksuperset370: x1-x2+y1-y2
 Doju: so you ahve a position (x1, y2) and a position (x2, y2)
 VicHofs: you can get it down in non time
 Doju: the manhattan distance between those is abs(x1-x2) + abs(y1-y2)
 cegprakash: abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
 sunksuperset370: what is abs
 Doju: where abs just takes the absolute value (aka positive value) of that
 Astrobytes: absolute value
 sunksuperset370: abs?
 muy31: | |
 Astrobytes: |value|
 muy31: |-2| = 2
 muy31: |2| = 2
 Xlos: |0|=-0
 muy31: no
 sunksuperset370: i know what absolute value is
 Xlos: yes
 sunksuperset370: how far from 0 the number is
 muy31: yes
 Doju: yes
 Astrobytes: OK then, abs is just usually the name of the method in most languages to get that
 muy31: like Java: Math.abs
 sunksuperset370: ok
 muy31: or JS: MAth.abs
 sunksuperset370: so i have to find the abs of the pelet position from the pac
 muy31: yes
 Doju: erm
 Astrobytes: Well, the Manhattan distance
 muy31: with the aim of looking for the closest  pac
 Doju: ^
 Astrobytes: Which uses the absolute value
 sunksuperset370: the abs of pellet and abs of pac
 cegprakash: manhattan distance = turns needed to reach a position
 muy31: sort of
 dbdr: this top 3 :D
 Doju: abs of  pac_x - pellet_x
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Doju: and abs of pac_y - pellet_y
 muy31: yes
 sunksuperset370: abs of pac position - abs of pallet postion
 Doju: then add those together and that's the distance between the pellet and the pac
 sunksuperset370: how do you write that in the code
 Astrobytes: |pacX - pelletX + pacY - pelletY|
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl is block pro
 cegprakash:&#160;:@&#160;:@
 Astrobytes: woops, too late
 Doju: umm
 Doju: Astrobytes that's not right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I missed two |
 Astrobytes: :P
 muy31: Math.abs(pacX - pelletX) + Math.abs(pacY - pelletY);
 Astrobytes: ^
 sunksuperset370: do we have to declare a variable for the pacs position to get the manhattan distance
 muy31: sunksuperset370 you in middle school? keep coding and asking for help
 sunksuperset370: yes
 sunksuperset370: i am in middle school
 sunksuperset370: really
 eulerscheZahl: what are you talking about cegprakash?
 muy31: i believe you i started in elementary with Khan Academy Js
 sunksuperset370: i stared in middle school with codecademy
 Astrobytes: sunksuperset370 you get your pac position in the input
 sunksuperset370: about a monther ago
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Astrobytes: Which language sunksuperset370?
 muy31: JS
 sunksuperset370: javascript
 Astrobytes: ah k, didn't see that
 muy31: i suggest you read a bit on parse-ing
 BenWo: hate it when I forget an asterisk
 muy31: parsing
 sunksuperset370: what does the parstint do
 muy31: yeah read on it google
 Astrobytes: That's what you should look up sunksuperset370&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: It will help you learn
 sunksuperset370: i can't search up things on google
 sunksuperset370: restriction mode
 Doju: that's quite a hinderance to learning
 sunksuperset370: school computer
 Astrobytes: oh I see
 cegprakash: I have 7 TODOs now
 sunksuperset370: most of the things are blockd
 muy31: ParseInt() returns an integer value
 muy31: w3schools.com
 sunksuperset370: like the return ()
 sunksuperset370: right
 muy31: no
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference</a>
 sunksuperset370: then we can log the information
 muy31: it reads it from the console to use in the code
 muy31: its the opposite of logging
 sunksuperset370: well console.log(return());
 AntiSquid: every single time i look at the leaderboard even the top 10 looks different
 muy31: console.log("Hello world");
 muy31: returns Hello World
 sunksuperset370: i know about that
 muy31: but readline()
 sunksuperset370: how do we use it then
 muy31: is different
 muy31: and parseInt is different
 Astrobytes: So if you get an input of  a string like "I am 37 years old" and you parseInt that, you get an int, 37
 Doju: what
 Doju: that's neat
 Astrobytes: I think
 muy31: The input comes from the game itself
 muy31: the game gives you a string input
 sunksuperset370: so it is returning the numbers from the string
 Astrobytes: Either way, it reads the input as integer other than string
 sunksuperset370: oh ok
 muy31: readline() gives you the string
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp</a> ParseInt if interested
 muy31: ParseInt gives you the next integer
 Counterbalance: that parseInt gives a NaN (not a number)
 muy31: default JS codingame code usually looks something like:
 sunksuperset370: a number inside a string
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 muy31: const a = readline().split(" ");
 AntiSquid: parseInt("40 years") + "<br />";
 AntiSquid: first one gives 40, second one Nan
 muy31: const b = parseInt(a[0]);
 muy31: and etc....
 ShannonNorris97: I can't believe I never knew that you could use parseInt to extract a number from a string. I always though it changed the type, but didn't realise it could actually pick a number out
 Doju: ShannonNorris97 ikr that's neat
 muy31: JS will try its best anyway
 Astrobytes: if you look in the Pacman default code you'll see:var inputs = readline().split(' ');const width = parseInt(inputs[0]); 
 Astrobytes: then const height = parseInt(inputs[1])
 sunksuperset370: what does the .split do
 Astrobytes: So that's the width and height of the grid, separated by a space
 muy31: Ok, say you have a string sunksuperset370
 AntiSquid: and generates array
 muy31: LIKE: ABBA
 Astrobytes: It splits the string according to a given delimiter, such as a space
 sunksuperset370: but there are no spaces in ABBA
 muy31: yes, so for ABBA. if you make the delimiter "B",
 muy31: it will return an array ["A","A"]
 Astrobytes: So you get "100 500", split(' ' ) will give you ["100", "500"]
 Astrobytes: parseInt those and you will get 100, 500
 sunksuperset370: it splits spaces, and alike stirngs
 muy31: "bob ate oranges" split("o") = ["b", "b"," ate ", "ranges"]
 Astrobytes: If you give it a sentence like "I am new" it will split the sentence into words if you say split(' ')
 sunksuperset370: so it returns an array of the strings
 muy31: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes
 muy31: parseInt converts a string to an integer
 sunksuperset370: oh ok
 sunksuperset370: thanks
 muy31: so parseInt("100") = 100
 sunksuperset370: so how do i write a mahhantan distnce in the code if the x and y is in a loop
 muy31: get the code out of the loop, by storing it somewhere
 Astrobytes: You need to store those x and y positions
 muy31: usually arrays do the trick
 muy31: in most cases
 sunksuperset370: ok
 muy31: using .push or something
 cegprakash: sunksuperset370 welcome to codingame &lt;3
 sunksuperset370: why the heart
 cegprakash: love new ppl joining
 muy31: anyway sunksuperset370 read <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp</a>
 sunksuperset370: oh ok
 cegprakash: I don't love you yet.. I love u if u wreck Astrobytes' bot
 muy31: tutorial on every JS method
 sunksuperset370: thanks muy31
 Astrobytes: lol cegprakash :D &lt;3
 muy31: welcome
 sunksuperset370: which level is astrobutes bot at
 muy31: silver
 sunksuperset370: like which league
 Astrobytes: Don't ask
 sunksuperset370: oh ok
 cegprakash: I think his noob bot is in Bronze sunksuperset370
 cegprakash: u can catch it in few hours
 Astrobytes: No I'm bronze&#160;:(
 muy31: lol
 sunksuperset370: oh ok
 sunksuperset370: whih level is sliver
 Astrobytes: Hey, I'm on dihydrocodeine, gimme a break
 muy31: yeesh Astrobytes
 sunksuperset370: yeh 
 sunksuperset370: give em a break
 sunksuperset370: man
 Astrobytes: How I've coded anything is beyond me
 DragonJ: In CSB I just boosted my opponent ...
 cegprakash: omg Astrobytes got corona?
 sunksuperset370: beginner's luck i guess
 sunksuperset370: wait
 sunksuperset370: what?
 Astrobytes: I had that in March cegprakash, now I have a lower-back problem, was at hospital and everything
 cegprakash: Did u just say Hydrochloroquine
 sunksuperset370: what is that
 sunksuperset370: oh wait
 sunksuperset370: i know
 sunksuperset370: its a medicine for maleria
 Hjax: he said dihydrocodeine, a painkiller 
 Astrobytes: No, dihydrocodeine, very strong synthetic opioid painkiller
 cegprakash: too mcuh computers Astrobytes?? get a bicycle and go for jogging once u become strong
 muy31: sunksuperset370 you completely distracted my btw
 sunksuperset370: yep i would suggest that too
 muy31: *me
 Astrobytes: No cegprakash, I was fit and healthy previously, it's just one of those things
 sunksuperset370: ok oh
 muy31: i can't go back to coding right now
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Hjax: i wish you a speedy recovery Astrobytes
 Earthborne: Do print (debug) messages get printed if I timeout later same round, or is it not necessarily so?
 Astrobytes: thanks Hjax
 sunksuperset370: same
 sunksuperset370: i wich that too
 sunksuperset370: *wich
 sunksuperset370: *wish
 cegprakash: "Tolerance and some of the most common side effects – drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting, and confusion – generally develops with long term use."
 sunksuperset370: ok i will go to coiding now
 sunksuperset370: *coding
 sunksuperset370: ttyl if need help
 muy31: sure man
 Doju: gl sunksuperset370
 Hjax: im surprised my bot is holding on so well at rank 100
 muy31: good luck in your future endeavours
 Astrobytes: I've been on it almost a week, it's not as bad now, but it's brutal for trying to keep a clear head and think, that's for sure
 cegprakash: they say that drug is addictive
 Ceej: Are we allowed to get help on debugging?
 cegprakash: don't get addicted
 pde-bakk: hey smart people, does the 50ms time limit for the spring challenge start after the last gets() call?
 pde-bakk: or at the start of the gameloop?
 muy31: Ceej you can get help on anything
 Illedan: After your first input reading.
 cegprakash: start of game loop
 sunksuperset370: ms?
 AlexRSS: Umm, bit confused right now
 muy31: about programming
 AlexRSS: I'm in Wood 1 so no kill conditions yet
 Illedan: pde-bakk, read 1 line of input, then start the timer.
 sunksuperset370: mood 2
 sunksuperset370: wood2
 sunksuperset370: there is no wood 1
 Braykin08: mood2 sounds way better
 AlexRSS: But I keep losing the bot test with the message "Only PINKY has pacs standing"
 muy31: sunksuperset370 sshhh
 AlexRSS: Yes there is
 thethiny: Wood 1 &gt; Wood 2 &gt; Bronze
 muy31: don't do this sunksuperset370
 sunksuperset370: but i started in wood 2
 pde-bakk: so start the timer after I get the my_score and opponent_score? or after I get all my pac and pellets information? cegprakash
 AlexRSS: Wood 1 is multiple pacs but otherwise same as Wood 2
 BenWo: yeah other way around
 muy31: thethiny what's with that?
 berries: bronze &gt; wood1 &gt; wood2
 thethiny: @muy31 🤷🏻‍♀️
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: ttyl
 thethiny: It's good to see the same people on
 cegprakash: reading inputs is like 0.001 ms.. don't worry about that pde-bakk
 AlexRSS: Anyway yeah, any idea wtf's going on? There's no kill conditions for my pacs in this league but they still seem to be dying
 thethiny: they die if you run out of time
 DragonJ: why cant I get speed to carry my pod in CSB?
 cegprakash: after reading inputs u can have a timout for 45 ms pde-bakk just to be safe
 pde-bakk: im using ruby and i placed Time.now around the gets.split call and it took 100ms 
 AlexRSS: This is happening around turn 30-40
 AlexRSS: Or do you mean time the process out?
 thethiny: @pde-bakk the first call is 1000ms
 Ceej: Any idea why my pacs work just fine for the first 10 moves and then start to go back and forth repeatedly?
 muy31: thethiny you dont neet the @
 Doju: Ceej maybe they don't see any pellets?
 berries: ceej mine did that when i had it so it would always go in one direction first 
 berries: when they didnt see any pellets 
 muy31: Ceej is in wood tho
 berries: so if you were at a wall it would go back and forth between two spots
 muy31: he sees all pellets
 Hjax: Ceej its a good idea to assume the whole map has pellets until you have a reason to believe otherwise 
 NinjaDoggy: nice...
 NinjaDoggy: seems like you can get silver without caring about enemy pacmen
 Hjax: oh hes in wood? maybe your pacs just keep changing their mind? try printing out their destinations 
 berries: yeah my alg is really dumb right now, i havent implemented a bfs yet so i can only see one pellet away 
 berries: like i can see more but my alg doesnt care about it yet 
 NinjaDoggy: berries
 NinjaDoggy: you don't NEED bfs
 NinjaDoggy: to care about pellets more than 1 away
 NinjaDoggy: just estimate their distance
 berries: wdym by estimate
 NinjaDoggy: with Math.abs(x1-x2) + Math.abs(y1-y2))
 Doju: manhattan
 NinjaDoggy: assume no walls
 Astrobytes: educated guess using Manhattan distance
 Ceej: I have the pacs move to the closest pellet near them, it worked when I only had one pac
 NinjaDoggy: ofcourse later you want BFS to get better values
 Maliamnon: i gave my pacs maps&#160;:) They are happier now.
 NinjaDoggy: but for now estimation is good
 berries: okay okay 
 Doju: Oh right, i'm not putting super cells into the grid
 Doju: no wonder my pacs aren't finding them
 RavenKZP: nice combo on escaping bronze :P
 NinjaDoggy: lol yeh :P
 RavenKZP: now its 5 :D
 sunksuperset370: how do we use the .push thing
 BenjaminUrquhart: by using it
 sunksuperset370: lol
 sunksuperset370: but how
 MonZtaDeluxe: .push(object)
 sunksuperset370: who do we write it in the code
 MonZtaDeluxe: with your keyboard
 sunksuperset370: i am trying to push the x value of the pack
 pde-bakk: what language?
 sunksuperset370: how to i write it in the code
 MonZtaDeluxe: or you can use the screenkeyboard and click with your mouse
 sunksuperset370: js
 AlexRSS: My pacs were 'dying' because of timeout btw, thanks whoever said that&#160;:-)
 cegprakash: well now Silver league is getting flooded
 cegprakash: did someone break Bronze boss?
 NinjaDoggy: oops mb
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;;)
 sunksuperset370: i am using javascript
 pde-bakk: yeah I didnt update my code since this afternoon and got to silver just now
 pde-bakk: sunksuperset370 sorry idk anything about javacript
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: sorr
 pde-bakk: na dw
 Hjax: what do you mean silver is getting flooded cegprakash?
 RavenKZP: NinjaDoggy u won ICE&amp;Fire?
 pde-bakk: i assume its pushes an element to the last spot of an array?
 sunksuperset370: muy31 are you online
 NinjaDoggy: 3rd yea
 sunksuperset370: no
 MonZtaDeluxe: "what is an array"?&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: close to winning until recurse smashed us :P
 RavenKZP: i know i remember u someow :P
 NinjaDoggy: XD
 NinjaDoggy: why does dbdr time out every time i run him locally
 NinjaDoggy: ._.
 mlomb: welcome to rust in the ide

 NinjaDoggy: ahhh thx
 NinjaDoggy: so... how does he test time limit
 NinjaDoggy: he just submits everytime to test?
 Astrobytes: lol, the only thing on the FAQ is the Rust issue :D
 muy31: sunksuperset370
 muy31: i am now online
 thethiny: @muy31 I know I don't need the @ but it makes it more obvious that this is a targeted message so others don't have to read it
 muy31: ok then
 pde-bakk: i do agree with @thethiny
 muy31: whatever, it's not like it matters
 thethiny: 😂😂
 pde-bakk: nah but otherwise it kinda looks like its just a word in a sentence
 pde-bakk: not a big deal but w/e
 muy31: how do you like this:
 muy31: while(true){System.out.println("@");
 muy31: }
 thethiny: unfortunately this will cause an inifinite loop
 thethiny: so we won't like it
 sunksuperset370: how do i get the x and y positions of both pallet and pac to one loop from two
 UndisclosedPandaFTW_dc3a: sup im new
 pde-bakk: thats what he wants isnt it?
 BenWo: welcome UndisclosedPandaFTW_dc3a
 muy31: sunksuperset370 save it somehow
 pde-bakk: make a struct, a class, an array or whatever you want to save every pac and pellet you get
 andr: any hints to beating bronze?
 muy31: ^
 sunksuperset370: but the variables are saved as const x and y in both loops 
 thethiny: @andr yes, beat the boss :P
 muy31: resave it
 sunksuperset370: if i push them the array will be pushed not the whole variable
 sunksuperset370: but how 
 NinjaDoggy: @andr don't worry about opponent, just focus on tracking pellets and eating them&#160;:)
 andr: @thethiny thanks that was super helpful :D
 sunksuperset370: do i resave it
 sunksuperset370: how
 muy31: var array = [];
 pde-bakk: beating bronze isnt easy dude, its not really supposed to. but I managed to do it without using the combat system, and just focusing on pathfinding
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 seronis: @andr never step into a cell direction beside an NPC your type cant eat
 muy31: For loop stuff...
 sunksuperset370: how does that
 andr: @NinjaDoggy do you mean I shouldn't waste moves on SWITCHing?
 sunksuperset370: work
 muy31: const x; const y;
 NinjaDoggy: yep, just speed whenever you can
 muy31: array.push(x);
 NinjaDoggy: and eat as many pellets as you can
 NinjaDoggy: i got like 5 points above the boss doing that
 sunksuperset370: ok enter in private chat
 andr: Huh
 sunksuperset370: muy31
 MonZtaDeluxe: NinJaDoggy what league are you in?
 pde-bakk: yeah same but i still think that killing other units gives you more map control and that simportant @ninjadoggy
 NinjaDoggy: silver... of course
 llllllllll: does anyone know how can I register my company?e.g. I work at Bosch, but our company is not registered, so it shows no logo, etc
 NinjaDoggy: i agree, but as far as beating bronze goes
 MonZtaDeluxe: and you got into silver with only speeding and eating pellets?
 NinjaDoggy: that's all that really matters
 MonZtaDeluxe: not attacking?
 NinjaDoggy: yep
 pde-bakk: yeah okay, agreed then
 pde-bakk: i mean, your pacs shouldnt suicide either but okay
 MonZtaDeluxe: wow&#160;:/ i think i do something wrong
 AntiSquid: nice rank doggy
 NinjaDoggy: thanks :D
 andr: @seronis didn't quite understand your point about not stepping in, tell me more pls
 NinjaDoggy: jumped like 3k ranks today XD
 AntiSquid: tons of motivation right there
 eulerscheZahl: usually that would result in a negative ranking
 NinjaDoggy: :P
 NinjaDoggy: true
 seronis: @andr however your pathfinding works it needs to be able to tell if you are trying to step into the cell directly beside other enemies.  because that means in the same turn they can enter that cell.   So never do that unless your type eats theirs
 AntiSquid: meanwhile i just fumble around with the high res clock check how fast my stuff is
 andr: @seronis ah thanks makes sense
 AntiSquid: still at 0.2 ms per turn
 NinjaDoggy: yea but honestly... don't bother with enemy pacs till silver
 NinjaDoggy: focus on making your own pacs not run into each other
 AntiSquid: maybe i should use the time
 NinjaDoggy: and attempt to distribute them across the map better
 seronis: and if you are ALREADY next to an enemy,  who can already eat you,  switch to what eats them so they suicide on attack
 andr: @NinjaDoggy yea them bumping into each other is annoying, any hints on that?
 AntiSquid: i didn't even distribute them properly yet
 seronis: you shouldnt attack.  its not reliable.  but defender can always win
 NinjaDoggy: many ways to do it... personally i did 2 things
 AntiSquid: not always 
 seronis: always
 andr: @seronis tried that defense thing, works like 30% of the time :D
 seronis: because attacker cant choose a new type AND move at same time
 NinjaDoggy: 1: have my simulation account for bumping and not allowing that
 AntiSquid: lol don't get so dramatic, also no
 NinjaDoggy: and 2:giving a negative bonus for having pacmen close to each other
 NinjaDoggy: in my eval
 NinjaDoggy: which also helps with distributing them across the map
 NinjaDoggy: combat is overrated unless you can trap kill i think
 NinjaDoggy: they can just run away from you and if you chase you don't collect anything while they do
 AntiSquid: maybe i need to rewrite, anything i change in my eval results in rank loss (or maybe ladder is just random)
 NinjaDoggy: yea... local maxes suck&#160;:(
 Doju: Do you guys think it's better to just write a bunch of sloppy code
 Doju: to get more functionality in
 Doju: or should i try to polish my existing things
 AntiSquid: i have a bunch of sloppy code doju
 llllllllll: depend 
 llllllllll: s
 AntiSquid: does that answer your question?
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 Peudoki: I'm doing bunch of sloppy code
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you don't have sloppy code during a contest you're not trying hard enough
 NinjaDoggy: you should make your code modular
 AntiSquid: sloppy code is meta
 Doju: antisquid ok so very polished code it is
 NinjaDoggy: so you can modify one part without messing up everything else
 llllllllll: sloppy code &gt; all
 Doju: :D
 NinjaDoggy: but in each part, make it sloppy :D
 BenWo: sloppy code &gt; unfinished code
 thethiny: as I said earlier:if x == 1:
 thethiny: part of my code
 llllllllll: ^ big true
 Doju: hahah
 AntiSquid: why thethiny why&#160;?
 BenWo: lol
 thethiny: just to be sure
 Doju: rofl
 NinjaDoggy: make extra sure x = 1
 llllllllll: you can never be certain enough
 VicHofs: @thethiny brilliant.
 Doju: i think you need to do this:
 AntiSquid: do a bitwise check too thethiny
 vmakaev: The system here doesn't support multiple files, or am I missing something obvious?
 andr: @NinjaDoggywhat do you do when the pac can't see any pellets around?
 thethiny: hmm interesting, bitwise is better
 Doju: if x == 1:
 llllllllll: add some comments like "if x is one, then x is one"
 NinjaDoggy: @andr that's the most important part to getting out of bronze
 thethiny: omg Doju that's even better!
 llllllllll: and do some typechecking
 NinjaDoggy: track what pellets exist/don't
 cegprakash: Hjax too many ppl coming into Silver quickly
 NinjaDoggy: assume a pellet exists until you see that it doesn't
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461660263">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461660263</a>
 VicHofs: if x=1:
 VicHofs: while True:
 VicHofs: x==1
 AntiSquid: true cegprakash, go back to bronze
 VicHofs: dfinitely gna work swer
 NinjaDoggy: :rofl:
 Doju: thetiny nice, so that's what you're spending your time on
 thethiny: yes XD
 VicHofs: do Halo next @thethiny
 Doju: if i use my ability
 andr: @NinjaDoggy thanks, gonna ask some more later :D
 Doju: is the cooldown on the next round 10 or 9?
 NinjaDoggy: who cares... just use it when up :P
 VicHofs: personally idk
 NinjaDoggy: are you really going to plan ability usage XD
 thethiny: 9
 thethiny: we tested it out
 VicHofs: DAMNIT IT KEEPS TIMING OUT
 VicHofs: im gonna find this server
 Doju: NinjaDoggy no, i'm just improving one bit of my code
 VicHofs: and say mean things
 Doju: VicHofs still working with strings?
 VicHofs: yes&#160;:(
 Doju: seriously you need to compile that function
 Doju: no not compile
 VicHofs: might try and change it
 Doju: i mean profile
 VicHofs: but bro am I lazy
 VicHofs: profile how
 Doju: i'll send you some input
 Doju: you can make a generator
 andr: what language are you using?
 Doju: and run your code locally
 VicHofs: I'm confused what
 VicHofs: andr u mean me?
 Doju: actually no
 andr: @VicHofs ye you
 Doju: just make the input yourself
 andr: @VicHofs cant imagine a runtime so slow
 VicHofs: p to the y to the thon @andr
 Doju: aka print out all the input you get from the game and copy that into your own locally running code
 VicHofs: @same here mate
 andr: @VicHofs oh wow something fishy there
 Doju: then you can compile it
 VicHofs: yeah ik
 Doju: why do i keep saying compile
 Doju: profile
 VicHofs: @Doju idk if that's even worth doing at this point lol
 thethiny: Why use Class when you can have unlimited Dictionaries
 Doju: yes it is
 thethiny:&#160;:^)
 cegprakash: NinjaDoggy lolol
 Doju: otherwise you're gonna spend ages trying to make meaningless improvements to the speed
 Doju: i profiled my thing and found out that i was running a function n too many times
 Doju: and guess what?
 Doju: that function was also running n times
 Doju: or looping n times*
 Doju: and n was the number of cells
 BenWo: well you were thorough at least
 thethiny: when people ask me why do I use python for competitions? I reply with:if 10 &gt; x &gt; 0:
 Doju: that doesnt work lol
 thethiny: try it
 Gogs: python is wonky&#160;:)
 VicHofs: that's that one snake right
 thethiny: in this competition it's width &gt; x &gt;= 0
 Doju: ohh thats what you mean lol
 thethiny: yes
 Doju: okay yeah
 thethiny: lol
 Doju: is that not in every language?
 thethiny: nop
 VicHofs: I have that going too lol
 cegprakash: that's syntax error
 thethiny: it's not syntax error in python
 VicHofs: nah it aint
 thethiny: and that's the best thing about it
 cegprakash: that's bad then
 thethiny: why bad?
 cegprakash: if it works
 VicHofs: wym
 cegprakash: coz what if all 3 are of diff types
 thethiny: that's your fault, not python
 VicHofs: lmao
 VicHofs: faxx
 thethiny: also python can handle types easily
 cegprakash: <i> &gt; 4 &gt; 7.2</i>
 thethiny: another example
 cegprakash: this can return true
 thethiny: c++:if (x == x2 &amp;&amp; y == y2)
 cegprakash: no I use p == p2
 thethiny: I meant x2 y2*
 Doju: okay, you guys say wonky code is goood in a competition
 Doju: wonky code it is
 cegprakash: I've a Point class
 cegprakash: with == comparator
 VicHofs: python king
 thethiny: yes but python has it by default 
 thethiny: saves you time to overload operators
 cegprakash: but u can't do p == p2
 thethiny: u can
 VicHofs: u mean override?
 thethiny: def __eq__
 cegprakash: u have to do px, py == p2x, p2y
 thethiny: no
 HKG: you can overload operators in C++ too
 VicHofs: gee guys this is taking yall nowhere
 cegprakash: VicHofs right
 cegprakash: I go continue my TODOs
 thethiny: class Point(self): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1afdaa3-3e81-44fb-9b39-4b8145ceb004">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1afdaa3-3e81-44fb-9b39-4b8145ceb004</a>
 cegprakash: python can be good to build something quickly but python runs too slow I wouldn't recommend
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: but my code is running in 2-3ms so I won't mind
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: fine then
 VicHofs: 2-3?
 thethiny: yeah
 cegprakash: every ms is important for me
 VicHofs: what kind of sorcery is this
 cegprakash: I run 10000 iffs in every 1 ms
 VicHofs: are you doing pathfinding?
 MattSOrme: same, most of my code runs in a couple ms, its only my search that takes the rest of the time
 Astrobytes: cegprakash not everyone is using a search
 cegprakash: it doesn't have to be a search to use lot of iffs
 thethiny: @VicHofs yes
 cegprakash: minimax  with pruning is lot off iffs too
 VicHofs: wtf how bro
 Astrobytes: I meant your importance of every ms
 Hjax: minimax is a search too 
 VicHofs: BFS?
 thethiny: max depth of 5 @VicHofs
 cegprakash: I'm now working on removing my iffs
 Astrobytes: *ifs
 HKG: hope you optimalized your datastructed for cpu caching
 VicHofs: oh so you're ending it prematurely when no results are found?
 HKG: optimized* 
 thethiny: yes as well
 VicHofs: oh ok
 HKG: data scructures*
 VicHofs: gotcha
 Doju: i seriously need to put in some kind of probabilities
 VicHofs: mine runs for longer in essence makes more sense lol
 BenWo: I've had that in the back of my mind Doju but really don't know if it'll be very consequential
 Bastett: I'm going crazy. My pellet tracker isn't clearing visibly empty spaces on the board. Yet all my tests pass. Hoping I don't have a bad assumption somewhere
 Doju: BenWo look at this<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462263619">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462263619</a>
 Doju: argh
 Doju: that's just painful to watch
 Adnmaster: guys im new in bronze any strategies?
 thethiny: @Bastett make sure your x+1 and these are right
 thethiny: @Doju why do you print BFS, you mean that you're moving?
 BenWo: sure
 BenWo: but if your 2nd pac hadn't died it would be an easy win
 AntiSquid: iffs = Illicit Financial Flows @Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: IFFs *
 thethiny: iff means if and only if
 Doju: thethiny i'm looking for the next cell basically using bfs
 Doju: well precalculated bfs but still
 thethiny: @Doju I know but why are you printing it
 Astrobytes: IFF = Interchangeable File Format
 thethiny: that too
 Astrobytes: *Interchange
 thethiny: YIFF = I don't wanna explain
 Astrobytes: And yes, I'm old
 Doju: thethiny well i mean why not print it if it lets me know what's going on?
 AntiSquid: there we go again, i make a change, i test it, it goes really well, i submit and then i get annoying random losses and feel like reverting to old code
 AntiSquid: annoying 
 thethiny: @Doju I know, I'm just asking if BFS means that youre moving or if it means that youre using BFS in this turn, then DFS later
 MonZtaDeluxe: i don't remember his name but to that guy who told me to ignore everything else and just eat pellets: thank you very much amigo
 VicHofs: lmao
 VicHofs: yo the weirdest thing
 Doju: thethiny i'm using bfs every turn
 llllllllll: what is this Hungarian dominance on the leaderboards
 VicHofs: y'all who were here a while ago
 AntiSquid: MonZtaDeluxe it was NinjaDoggy
 Doju: if it returns nothing i fallback to random
 Bastett: BFS -&gt; Breadth First Search
 MonZtaDeluxe: ah yeah - exactly - thank you
 VicHofs: is that sometimes I don't time out at all
 Doju: then it says random
 VicHofs: But sometimes it does
 VicHofs: like wtf
 Doju: i just climbed 150 ranks by giving just a little more priority to super pellets
 Bastett: Huh. I am clearing the empty cells correctly, but something is putting them back in.
 AntiSquid: people dropped about 150 ranks since yesterday (those that didn't improve enough anyway)
 MattSOrme: nice doju. Almost reaching silver then?
 Doju: MattSOrme pretty soon if i not just put in not suiciding
 Doju: or even not going for the same pellet probably
 BenWo: submitting
 MattSOrme: Bastett, are you updating a copy?
 BenWo:&#160;:-/
 THEASIAN: :grin:
 Doju: actually i wanna test upping the super pellet priority just a bit more
 Bastett: MattSorme we'll find out as I debug I guess&#160;:)
 Bastett: I must have a bad bitmask calculation somewhere I suppose
 Bastett: I don't appear to be reinitializing the arrays
 ijc90: whatup? 
 ijc90: i just got to silver and i got NO IDEA what to optimize
 ijc90: it seems like others do almost the same but just win
 ijc90:&#160;:-P
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: no
 ijc90: what are your strategies?
 Dav1dS: im curious, is anyone doing pathfinding in either js or python?
 thethiny: python yes
 ijc90: im doing BFS to calculate distance
 cegprakash: ijc90 check euler's bot
 ijc90: on python
 cegprakash: all bots are diff from each other ijc90
 Dav1dS: i tried astar to calculate distance and it timed out
 Dav1dS: in both python and js
 VicHofs: A* is gonna take too long
 VicHofs: stick with BFS
 Doju: how come?
 Doju: it's faster than the bfs that everybody is using
 llllllllll: I use a* and it works fine
 Doju: if you're going to a single target
 llllllllll: (python)
 Dav1dS: so BFS would be better for this sort of map?
 thethiny: when you have too many walls
 thethiny: A* is slower
 Doju: oh relaly?
 VicHofs: I'd say so anyway
 Doju: okay
 thethiny: I tried both
 thethiny: with A* it was 3.2s
 thethiny: with DFS it was 2.8
 thethiny: BFS*
 Doju: but yes Dav1dS BFS is fine and it returns a perfect result
 Hjax: bfsing between all combinations of points at the start of the game and storing the results in an array is pretty convenient 
 Hjax: you have a whole second, even python should be able to manage that 
 BenWo: bronze 25 :D
 llllllllll: I do the same, yeah
 Astrobytes: And if you do what hjax said you can use the distance as an admissable heuristic for your A* if you wish to use it for further pathfinding
 ijc90: i do BFS and i limit interactions to "N" so i can calculate on real time
 ijc90: but precalculating everything makes sense!
 cegprakash: AntiSquid climbing up in SIlver
 Hjax: that 1000 ms is basically pure gold 
 Hjax: precompute everything you can 
 Hjax: because 50 ms is not a lot for a turn 
 HKG: are there any IDE plugins for this site? 
 Bastett: Hmm, maybe sight range isn't what I thought it was
 HKG: I'd rather use my own IDE instead of the bult in one. ;_:
 Hjax: i just copy paste my code from my IDE HKG
 Astrobytes: Look for CGSync and CGLocal in the forum HKG
 Bastett: no, documentation is clear, sight lines are infinite in cardinal directions
 Bastett: hmm
 Hjax: you cant see through walls Bastett
 BenWo: silver :smile:
 Astrobytes: gz BenWo
 Bastett: Hjax nah this isn't a wall problem
 Bastett: it's probably a bitmask off-by-one
 BenWo: thx
 Bastett: bitmask is correct... man
 THEASIAN: damndang yall so much smarter than me
 VicHofs: welcome to the club @THEASIAN
 THEASIAN: Thx man
 muy31: i dk how i promoted, but i did
 Astrobytes: gj muy31
 Doju: I have a bunch of ideas but implementing them will lead to variable optimization hell
 thethiny: tell me about it T_T
 AlexRSS: woop woop
 Derthek: and they dont guarantee success :D
 AlexRSS: Finally figures out making them loop the edges when following pellets
 Doju: Derthek yeah and that
 AlexRSS: Now just need to make them stop eternally headbutting if they meet each other
 Bastett: Ah hah. The removal and masking is good... but it thinks there are visible pellets when there are not
 andr: My each "improvement" drops me 100 rank places, wtf :D
 Doju: Although as a temporary imporvement i think it's time that i dig my old flood fill function back out of its grave and do pathfinding with pacs as obstacles
 Derthek: +1
 thethiny: I have in the same scope:x, _x, __x. I need a better naming scheme haha
 Maliamnon: 13 in bronze, c'mon!
 Maliamnon:&#160;:)
 Bastett: Dur. Visible pellets are new each turn. Clear the fsking array.
 Derthek: Doju, do you have a good reference for flood fill? never heard of it (:
 cegprakash: come on Maliamnon
 cegprakash: if someone is at #13 in Bronze I would just suggest resubmit
 cegprakash: :D
 Maliamnon: 9th now, 65% of battles done
 Doju: Derthek i'm not really sure if that's what it's called but i'm basically doing this but instead of a single specified end point i have a set of criteria <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search</a>
 Derthek: thanks
 cegprakash: I was at rank 26 at 87% and got promoted
 cegprakash: with only 70 games anything is possible
 Astrobytes: Derthek check out redblobgames.com
 AntiSquid: thanks for announcement cegprakash
 AntiSquid: but what does climbing mean&#160;?
 thethiny: I put you as CEO of trolling
 AntiSquid: sorry for demanding clarity
 muy31: if i advance 100 places, ill be the best at Java
 muy31: BET
 thethiny: in silver?
 muy31: yaah
 thethiny: nice
 AntiSquid: you can advance 100 places and then drop back 100 places with same bot muy31
 AntiSquid: doesn't mean anything
 thethiny: I was 86 in bronze now I'm 227 without submits
 thethiny: :D
 thethiny: people stop submitting
 muy31: ssh, no one cares about the technicalities
 AntiSquid: wow ... that's just stupid
 AntiSquid: ssh&#160;? muy31 what are you trying to do
 muy31: advance ofc
 BenWo: rank 600 silver I still see people insta-timeout
 MonZtaDeluxe: guys DFS is for distance between 2 positions, right?
 Doju: BFS
 Doju: for that
 Colios13: yeah cuz of the dead pac
 MonZtaDeluxe: i would use BFS rather for looking "what's around me"
 Colios13: Someone still have a mahattan in silver?
 thethiny: Guys don't forget that multiline coding is possible
 cegprakash: lol Colios13 I would be surprised
 thethiny: guys how many people are there in silver rn?
 Doju: MonZtaDeluxe depth-first doesn't always give you the shortest path
 cegprakash: 744 and climbing fast thethiny
 thethiny: woah, thanks
 thethiny: 745 now?
 thethiny: cuz I just got up 1 rank
 MonZtaDeluxe: Doju i know, but in every recursion step i check the path distance
 Colios13: Me i have cegprakash but wanted to know if someone have a better manhattan than me
 MonZtaDeluxe: i take always the min
 Doju: alright, you do you
 MonZtaDeluxe: shortest path is usually dijkstra i guess
 cegprakash: better manhattan is actual walking distance
 MonZtaDeluxe: i think i should switch to dijkstra for shortest path
 cegprakash: Colios13 use actual walking distance 
 MonZtaDeluxe: between 2 points
 Bastett: Right. Rewriting my class based data structure into an array of unsigned ints has improved performance massively
 Bastett: depth search goes deeper now before timing out
 Doju: MonZtaDeluxe well sure anything works i guess
 AntiSquid: thethiny when i look at my ranking results i am calling bullshit, but he never answers the phone
 cegprakash: MonZtaDeluxe plz don't use dijkstra it's not a weighted graph it's an unweighted graph plz use BFS
 thethiny: nice
 MonZtaDeluxe: ok sorry dijkstra is wrong
 Bastett: but my pacs are morons. So I've broken the search algorithm in the rewrite
 Astrobytes: made me laugh AntiSquid
 MonZtaDeluxe: my problem is i already have BFS for checking my environment
 Bastett: job for tomorrow
 MonZtaDeluxe: i can also use BFS for checking the distance between two points?
 Doju: just do what everyone does and check the distance from every cell to every other cell during the first move
 Astrobytes: Yes MonZtaDeluxe
 Doju: except if you want to care about the pacs
 Doju: then that wont help you
 MonZtaDeluxe: i currently assume that pacs are like walls
 Doju: sure then do bfs on a per turn basis
 Colios13: Yes i know i should use BFS but i just wanted to know if it's possible to do much better than this with manhattan it's more like a challenge
 cegprakash: BFS tutorial as many ppl keep pinging me&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-cxgUXcMk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-cxgUXcMk</a>
 Astrobytes: The tutorials from Amit on redblobgames.com are absolutely foolproof tbh, they even have interactive examples
 MonZtaDeluxe: okay i see how i can check distance now with BFS - there's also a "frontier" and stuff - didn't consider that
 MonZtaDeluxe: thanks
 cegprakash: MonZtaDeluxe BFS = level order traversal.. suppose u start bfs from Point A and u reach Point B in 4th level then the distance between point A to point B is 4
 MonZtaDeluxe: Yep i just have seen that - thank you!
 MonZtaDeluxe: is already implemented
 MattSOrme: hmm. got a weird one where i have a list of 3 positions, but when i iterate over it, only 2 are being picked up&#160;:/ 
 MattSOrme: neighbours 3 ['6,3', '4,3', '5,2']here 6,3here 5,2
 cegprakash: Is it possible to see throw an enemy pac?
 Astrobytes: Check the ref cegprakash, it shouldn't be (logically) but check the ref anyway 
 muy31: honestly, i think they should have made the wood 2 boss better
 muy31: so that bronxe wouldnt be so packed
 cegprakash: disagree..
 cegprakash: wood2 is all about moving all the pacs
 cegprakash: it's a drastic change already
 cegprakash: from wood1
 muy31: really, i submitted my wood 1 code and immediately promoted to bronze
 Flyingkid: that's good
 muy31: i meant wood 1
 Astrobytes: muy31 Bronze is just so packed since we have more participants than usual
 Flyingkid: thats where the fun begins
 muy31: they should make wood 1 boss better
 Flyingkid: full rules are bronze league (mostly)
 cegprakash: Astrobytes here is the code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/d71009713f346163031ad2ad99198a0ef60f56a3/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Game.java#L959">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/blob/d71009713f346163031ad2ad99198a0ef60f56a3/src/main/java/com/codingame/spring2020/Game.java#L959</a> 
 cegprakash: but I can't understand it
 cegprakash: it's so hacky
 cegprakash: in problem statement it says "The line of sight of the pacs is blocked by the walls."
 cegprakash: so I'm assuming it's not blocked by other pacmen
 Astrobytes: Hmm, I'm a bit high off these pain meds but it looks like that yeah
 AlexRSS: What is dfs that people keep talking about? I'm using manhattan distance at the moment and have seen people talking about dfs as what to replace that with
 thethiny: "pain meds"&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I'd have to read through it a bit more carefully tho, which I'm not really able to right now&#160;:/
 thethiny: @AlexRSS basically instead of getting distance, you get the points you have to step on
 thethiny: distance from 0,0 to 0, 4 is 4
 Astrobytes: In fact, I'm gonna go watch a movie or something. Can't code.Gn all
 thethiny: DFS from 0,0 to 0,4 is 0,0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4
 Doju: night
 AlexRSS: Right
 AlexRSS: I get you
 AlexRSS: And doing that you can check along the way for issues like collisions or other pacs
 thethiny: yes
 thethiny: you give them a score
 thethiny: and then you return the path with the highest score
 tonowak: can someone help me with understanding how the movement resolution/collisions work?
 muy31: shortest distance to your choice
 muy31: first shortest distance
 tonowak: like, how can cancelling create new collisions?
 tonowak: and how to implement collision resolution?
 muy31: if a pac is behind another
 muy31: when the one in the front collides
 Maliamnon: Silver!&#160;:)
 AlexRSS: Thanks muy&#160;:-)
 thethiny: wd Maliamnon!
 muy31: Crossing paths or landing on the same cell as another pac will cause a collision to occur. This is how collisions are resolved: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a063cf43-866f-495e-b5d7-70728cfb3f2d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a063cf43-866f-495e-b5d7-70728cfb3f2d</a>
 thethiny: 32bal 3ndi bs a3ref 5alle9
 tonowak: ok muy31, I see. Yes, I know the rules, but that is not really clear to me how to implement those rules in my bot&#160;;)
 thethiny: you don't
 thethiny: these are implemented
 muy31: honestly, you dont need to worry about collisions too much, just avoid them w/ your own pacs
 muy31: are you trying to use minamax or something
 tonowak: yes, I'm writing a sim
 muy31: i don't recommend cause timeout
 tonowak: I still want to try&#160;;)
 muy31: euler tried to implement Monte Carlo and said it screwed everything up
 tonowak: that's interesting. How it screwed up?
 muy31: ask him, i dont know the details
 NinjaDoggy: cuz euler bad :P
 muy31: but if Monte didn't work minamax probably wouldnt either
 tonowak: I'm not going for minimax, I'm also going for some form of specialized monte
 NinjaDoggy: monte would work
 NinjaDoggy: euler bad :P
 muy31: well good luck ig but it is a lot of calculations don't you think&gt;
 tonowak: ok, so how would the pseudocode of movement resolution look like?
 muy31: you want the rules or something
 MonZtaDeluxe: actually i'm think about -&gt; why no floodfill for distance?&#160;:/
 tonowak: next_turn_pacs = pacs.move_all()if next_turn_pacs.pac[i].position == pacs.pac[j].position:
 tonowak: though, that doesn't check if a cancelling can create another cancelling...
 muy31: just recheck if the new x's and y's are duplicates of another
 thethiny: the best thing about python is using the variable's name as a string
 thethiny: 😍
 muy31: pac's x's and y's
 muy31: keep checking until no more duplicates are found
 tonowak: of another older, yes?
 muy31: yes
 muy31: or of all
 muy31: then if speed, once more for each speeding pac
 tonowak: ok, so when I detect one collision, then I should order the pacs to just not move, and repeat while there is a collision, yes?
 muy31: yes i believe that's right
 tonowak: hmm but something about the order of collisions is wrong
 tonowak: like, what if three pacs are trying to go into one cell?
 muy31: is it possible to look at the chat from yesterday?
 tonowak: I cancel two of them
 muy31: they all bounce
 muy31: back
 OlgaVDB: hi guys, are anyone else's pacs moving slowly when debugging? I see blue ones moving with normal speed (with occasional boost) and mine look like they're "frozen"...
 tonowak: alright, the pseudocode I gave doesn't include this&#160;:(
 muy31: i had a replay once with some weird cool collisions, but i didnt save it anywhere
 muy31: it would have been useful to you
 tonowak: I'll ask for a pseudocode on discord
 muy31: BenWo do you remember?
 thethiny: guys don't u hate rush coding :D
 AlexRSS: Just got into bronze. How is the line of sight thing actually implemented? 
 duckquackduck: if any pacman is using speed boost, and others are not, then it will look like some pacs are moving slowly @OlgaVDB
 AlexRSS: My old code which is feeding commands for pellets out of the pacs line of sight doesn't crash immediately as expected, just after 30 turns or so
 barbora: you can check the referee to see how the collisions are resolved
 Caled: (
 BenWo: sorry what muy31? been debugging
 tonowak: barbora I checked and the code is not readable
 MattSOrme: im debugging so much more than coding tonight, its upsetting
 muy31: do you remember that one replay w/ the collisions that you explained
 muy31: from yesterday or so
 BenWo: ohhh
 muy31: yeah it could be useful to tonowak
 njaber: found it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461585269">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461585269</a>
 BenWo: let me look at my history, was that a replay of your bot?
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: against kellthazar i think
 njaber: It's the one I just sent
 AlexRSS: Ahh wait figured it out I think
 njaber: Wait
 njaber: no
 njaber: I thought it was this one
 muy31: njaber no it has me in it
 OlgaVDB: well, they move normally in the beginning and then after 10 moves or so visibly slow down
 njaber: Wasn't this the one we were talking about yesterday?
 AlexRSS: Am I right that if Pac 1 can see a pellet, then Pac 2 can have a command to navigate to that pellet?
 tonowak: oh god, there is really a lot of weird collisions going on in this replay
 njaber: You can have a command to move anywhere, even if you don't see there
 MattSOrme: Been playing the same match over for the last hour+&#160;:(
 thethiny: my pac 3 went into sicko mode<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462332080">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462332080</a>
 njaber: I manage to deduce what I think are the collision rules Yesterday, if you have a question don't hesitate to ask
 BenWo: found it &gt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/460845826">https://www.codingame.com/replay/460845826</a>
 BenWo: from frame 28
 muy31: how did you find it anyway?
 muy31: History?
 BenWo: yeah just my browser history
 tonowak: thanks for the replays! BenWo njaber
 BenWo: I opened about 20 replays from around that time, lol
 muy31: lol
 tonowak: njaber yeah I'm trying to write a movement resolution, but I'm having a hard time understanding how to code the given rules
 njaber: From my understanding the resolution goes in this order&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d46d643-121a-487c-80cf-3d2e22a124d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9d46d643-121a-487c-80cf-3d2e22a124d3</a>
 njaber: What, why is the beginning of the message both in the message and the pastebin?
 BenWo: makes it easier to read
 njaber: I should correct myself on step 3
 tonowak: "incopatible" in step 3, you mean any pacs on the same cell?
 njaber: 3) If 2 OR more pacs ... move them all back
 njaber: Only pacs of the same team or of the same type
 njaber: all moving back from a single set 3 happens at once
 BenWo: pacs can't occupy the same cell, except if one can eat the other
 DollarAkshay: I think I might break topp 100 with just lazily changing heuristic numbers
 DollarAkshay: XD\
 DollarAkshay: :trophy: :100:
 tonowak: I see. I think I understand. You wrote it in a really clear way, that should be in rules. Thanks njaber!
 njaber: np
 thethiny: @njaber yes that's exactly how I perceive the rules
 AntiSquid: it's doable DollarAkshay
 njaber: The part that isn't really clear in the rules are setp 2 and the fact that step 3 works even with 3 or more pacs (ex: 1 red scissors, 1 red rock, 1 blue rock)
 Doju: Question:
 njaber: I think what I wrote as step 2 is what's this is supposed to mean&#160;:"a pac can't cross the path of a stronger pac: it will be blocked"
 BenWo: finally found my bug, had to do with the new "DEAD" type of course
 Doju: i have a list of Pac instances. If i want to access a specific one by id
 Doju: do i have to loop through the entire list and check its id and see if it matches or is there a smart way to do that?
 DollarAkshay: Rank 107 :P Need a boost guys
 BenWo: Doju - I put them in a dict just so I could find them easily
 BenWo: pac_list[pac_id] = Pac(input())
 Doju: BenWo that's what i had 10 minutes ago but i decided to instead make the dict have keys for my pacs and enemy pacs
 Doju: and i dont wanna bother with stacking dicts
 BenWo: i have one dict for my pacs, one for enemies
 Doju: fair enough
 Doju: but anyways your response sounded like there is no smart way to do it
 Doju: so i'm just gonna do it the naive way
 BenWo: I'm not exactly an arbiter of python knowledge, lol
 njaber: Wait wat, the error output gets cropped after a certain number of turns? I have the the same number of lines each turn but after frame 98 of my game only the first few dozens of lines are printed (always the same amount for each turn after 98, that seems strange to me
 DollarAkshay: I guess its based on number of characters then
 DollarAkshay: One of your lines must have a lot of characters
 njaber: The number of charaters doesn't chage between turns either
 njaber: I print the map as charaters
 njaber: so the number of charaters is always the same
 DollarAkshay: Send the replay file
 njaber: I don't think logs are shown in a replay are they?
 BenWo: they are
 DollarAkshay: I think they are
 cegprakash: MCTS at what depth guys
 cegprakash: :O
 DollarAkshay: I tried running min-max for all my pacs. I was not able to go beyond depth 1 on python XD
 Doju: lmao

 cegprakash: lmao
 avdg: not sure if I will continue on my bot or not for now
 avdg: this contest is just temporary and other stuff has more impact long term :p
 cegprakash: njaber we can't see ur error streams. And yes there is a limit. I've faced this before
 njaber: I can see the error stream when I watch the replay tho
 njaber: and what's strange is the limit seems to change after a certain number of turns
 cegprakash: avdg there are stuffs important than CG?
 DollarAkshay: I just verified. The error stream shows up in replays
 cegprakash: no njaber the limit is for each player.. not each turn
 cegprakash: u can't DollarAkshay if it's someone else's replay
 njaber: I meant per player per turn, but if you mean a limit for the whole game, my error output still continues to display, jsut less lines then before that point
 cegprakash: anyone can decode my eval with what I print on error console. 
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: thanks that it's hidden
 DollarAkshay: Can you see my logs in this repaly&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462346249">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462346249</a>
 DollarAkshay:&#160;?
 njaber: They'd just need to remove error outputs from non-IDE matches
 cegprakash: no DollarAkshay
 njaber: Nope can't see
 DollarAkshay: Oh nevermind
 DollarAkshay: My bad
 cegprakash: my win rate has went down to 42% as I parked my bot for a long time
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: and it has played 386 games already
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: I think ones in the middle of the ladder gets lot of matches
 njaber: Basically I have&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e947c72-6e0c-42f6-8d21-937d0a83ad8d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e947c72-6e0c-42f6-8d21-937d0a83ad8d</a>
 Clagus: guys, is it possible to perform BFS for all possible cell pairs in the 500ms of the first turn?
 Doju: Clagus eeasily
 BobLaserShark: Yes
 Clagus: damn... I think I need that
 thethiny: guys when you say BFS for all pairs
 njaber: Clagus I do it in 13ms
 Clagus: O_o
 thethiny: do you mean from my dest to pel, or from pel to pel
 cegprakash: njaber lot of spoiler lolz
 DollarAkshay: Whaat no i dont think its possible from all cells
 njaber: cegprakash yeah I know, I do'nt really care XD
 cegprakash: Clagus I do that in 1 ms
 DollarAkshay: You wont have enough computation for other stuff
 Doju: there was someone who did it in the order of microseconds
 Clagus: ;_;
 njaber: DollarAkshay not each turn, but at the start of the game
 Doju: something ridiculous like 60 or something with some stupid fast optimizations
 DollarAkshay: BPS from each cell&#160;? :O
 DollarAkshay: BFS*
 Doju: yeah
 DollarAkshay: Damn I should do that then
 Clagus: it's like 90k pairs
 avdg: cegprakash yes :p
 avdg: did patched uglify (now terser in the past)
 avdg: people liked that
 avdg: *(now terser) in the past
 avdg: though there is some work there too that I like to do
 avdg: but it's for something else
 DollarAkshay: 104 :P
 cegprakash: 35x17x35x17=354025/1000000000 = 0.000354025
 DollarAkshay: Need a boost guys :P
 cegprakash: so mine runs in like 0.3 ms
 cegprakash: which is &lt; 1 ms
 avdg: but for my ai, I probably have to rewrite my bfs logic, which is now implemented as 2 overlapping bfs and is slightly broken
 Clagus: cegprakash but only for !wall
 cegprakash: yes can be faster than 0.3
 avdg: (aka can be tuned better, and some disconnect between different logics, like few pieces having their own life without coordinating)
 DollarAkshay: Yes Rank 98 :D
 BenWo: didn't expect this.... frame 55<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/462353350">https://www.codingame.com/replay/462353350</a>

 thethiny: exactly
 BenWo: LOL
 WillNess: @Slyracoon23
 cegprakash: njaber u track opponent positions?
 njaber: Yes
 thethiny: every step or sometimes?
 njaber: Always
 thethiny: and how accurate are you
 njaber: been working on that for 3 days
 thethiny: woah
 thethiny: I only track big pellets
 thethiny: if they're gone
 thethiny: then 
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLBBRuVDOo4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLBBRuVDOo4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18</a>
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: u don't have to track big pellets thethiny it's already given in input in every turn
 thethiny: I track if they're gone I mean
 njaber: I don't always know where he is but most of the times there is a pretty small range, I still need to integrate a few infos tho, like collisions with my pacs along a corner, eaten pacs, and pellets which were taken, I only take pellets which weren't taken into account rn, but all these should be pertty easy to add now that I have the core algorithm
 cegprakash: with what I see in ur logs njaber I think it's not worthy to implement it lolz
 thethiny: For me I think tracking enemies is not worth it
 thethiny: if enemy distance is &lt; 2 then I either run away or eat it
 njaber: I know what I want to do with it, and I know it's worth for what I want to use it for, not gonna spoil that tho
 thethiny: okay then
 thethiny: good luck :D
 cegprakash: wow 
 Clagus: I wish there would be option to see the battle with fog of war enabled
 njaber: Yes
 Kellthazar: I always check the path between the last and current enemy as "explored"
 DollarAkshay: Prett cool option
 njaber: Kellthazar all possible paths? or just shortest path?
 Clagus: ^
 Kellthazar: The shortest one...
 thethiny: if all paths then all grid
 thethiny: lol
 Clagus: I guess that could work for higher leagues :D
 Doju: what do you mean by last and current enemy?
 njaber: Not always accurate then, I'm tryign to get it as accurate as I can with the given info
 Clagus: las and current position of bot with id I would assume
 Kellthazar: last and current position of an enemy I mean
 thethiny: I'm sure you track frame 1 correctly though&#160;;)
 njaber: I'm happy with its speed for now, but I think there are a few optimizations I could do still
 Doju: waaaaaiiiitt
 cegprakash: omg big spoiler Kellthazar but thanks and it's risky
 Doju: you can see their id!?
 thethiny: yes
 njaber: Yes
 Doju: oh that's a smart play
 Doju: and it's a pretty valid one
 Clagus: if you can see them :D
 njaber: My algorithm would never work if I didn't see ids
 Doju: huh, that's interesting
 Doju: also i need to go to bed
 cegprakash: I just want to see njaber wreck eulerscheZahl's bot
 Doju: an hour ago i was ike
 Doju: like:
 Clagus: 1 question, so you guys say its viable to do Dijkstra at the start of the game
 Doju: "I'll just implement this adaptive pathfinding real quick before bed"
 cegprakash: no Clagus
 cegprakash: BFS
 Clagus: to get all distances between all pairs?
 cegprakash: yes Clagus
 thethiny: why, can someone please explain
 thethiny: I still haven't found a use for it
 Doju: then i stumbled on a million bug and a few function rewrites and here we are an hour later with no real improvements
 Clagus: isn't Dijkstra an example of BFS? :P
 cegprakash: u can do that with bfs in 0.0003 secs
 Doju: million bugs*
 cegprakash: yes dijkstra = BFS + heap
 DollarAkshay: BFS is a special case for Diskstra
 cegprakash: in BFS u don't need a heap
 DollarAkshay: Where all edges have equal weight
 Clagus: oh ok
 Clagus: oh right right
 njaber: cegprakash it may happen once I implement the actual move descision algorithm, I got a neat idea in mind
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: looking forward for ur implementation
 cegprakash: and seeing the replay
 cegprakash: so that I can counter it
 cegprakash: if not at least steal it
 cegprakash: :D
 Kellthazar: Yeah, but, it's risky, but I think is helpful for my heuristc. :D
 Doju: or actually i did improve something: added recognizing the enemies, but that's it
 Doju: anyways cya everybody
 Kellthazar: One thing I added now...
 thethiny: I added 2 with 2 and I got 4
 Kellthazar: "real" distance to a cell
 cegprakash: lol finally
 Kellthazar: considering the pac velocity
 njaber: cegprakash I doubt it's gonna be easy to reverse engineer without any hint so countering/stealing would probably be pretty hard. I think my algorithm will look very AI like and it will be hard to udnerstand what the descisions behind it actually entail
 cegprakash: someone asked if there are ppl in SIlver using manhattan
 njaber: Tho I don't plan on doing any AI
 cegprakash: but u actually did exist
 cegprakash: :D
 Kellthazar: My last submit drop my rank a lot... lol
 thethiny: why would manhattan be bad
 Kellthazar: Still calculating though...
 cegprakash: thethiny because there can be walls in between
 cegprakash: so mahattan is not the real walkable distance
 thethiny: I understand 
 thethiny: but if you only move by 1
 thethiny: then manhattan would suffice
 thethiny: because if there's a wall
 MonZtaDeluxe: actually i'm thinking about scraping my bot and switching to sim
 thethiny: manhattan would give 2
 thethiny: not 1
 cegprakash: u have to use some distance
 cegprakash: wait what
 MSmits: manhattan targeting is better than targeting a random pellet 
 cegprakash: manhattan will give 2 when there is a wall? it should give Infinity
 MSmits: bfs targeting is better than manhattan targeting
 Clagus: manhattan got me to bronze but not much further :P
 MSmits: cooperative search between pacs is better than bfd targeting
 MSmits: bfs that is
 thethiny: @cegprakash it would give 2 if a wall is between you and the pellet
 cegprakash: which is wrong
 cegprakash: A#B
 cegprakash: should not return 2
 cegprakash: it should return INF
 MSmits: of course it should, it's manhattan distance&#160;:)
 MSmits: not real travelled distance
 MSmits: 2 is correct
 cegprakash: okay but it's wrong
 cegprakash: we need real distance
 MSmits: it's not the real distance, but its not wrong
 thethiny: I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying it's correct
 thethiny: 2 is correct but not right
 njaber:  And I'm here saying it's left
 Cappefra: it's a right implementation of the manhattan distance, it's a wrong representation of reality
 MSmits: it's a great way to get out of wood is what i tis
 Cappefra: you're just saying the same thing with different words :D
 Cappefra: yeah exactly
 MSmits: I used BFS to get out of wood
 njaber: agreed
 MSmits: but I did not need to have done that
 Kellthazar: Cooperative search...
 cegprakash: not sure what I should write. I don't know who is right and what is correct I'll  be right back
 Cappefra: Same
 MSmits: yes Kellthazar, consider all your pacs at once instead of letting each pac do his own thing
 Cappefra: btw MSmits I just changed my entire AI's brain to try and implement my first ever Monte Carlo
 Kellthazar: Really nice approach...
 MSmits: thats great
 MSmits: this is also the first time i am doing this MC thing
 Kellthazar: Time to do a big refactor I guess...
 thethiny: I scrapped my bot entirely now let's start from scratch
 Cappefra: any tips? It's still a bit stupid and I can't really do many iterations before timeout
 MSmits: how many
 thethiny: 1 too many
 Cappefra: I'm doing it cooperatively, meaning it's one monte carlo for all pacs and not one for each
 MSmits: yes 
 njaber: A simple cooperative search is assigning each pellet to the closest pac, and then each pac chooses the closes from the list of peallets given to it
 MSmits: but how many iterations do you get and how deep do you get on each iteration
 Cappefra: and I can make around 50 cycles of depth 5 (so distance 10 if with speed)
 MSmits: 50 is not good
 Cappefra: without considering enemies
 MSmits: is this in 50 ms?
 Cappefra: yeah
 MSmits: I get between 30-100k
 MSmits: depending on the map
 Cappefra: wait
 Kellthazar: Anyone tried a neural network training + GA solution, on its not case?
 Cappefra: wot
 gh2oost: Does anyone know why c# stopwatch can incorrectly measure?
 Cappefra: 100k?
 MSmits: to deph 8 also
 Cappefra: wtf
 MSmits: yes, on a simple map
 Neon_Tuts: hi
 MSmits: c++ helps, but thats only a factor of 3-5
 Cappefra: ok wtf am I doing wrong lol
 MSmits: so you're doign something wrong indeed
 MSmits: there's many things it can be
 Cappefra: yeah that's a 10^3 factor
 MSmits: a thing that helped me  a lot is not creating lists of neighbors
 MSmits: during the simulation
 MSmits: I already have the lists for each cell
 MSmits: and i just loop over them
 Hjax: i get like 25k iterations at depth 8 with 2 pacs, less with more pacs 
 Cappefra: yeah not a bad idea, I can use the 1000 ms for that
 Hjax: and yeah i precompute neighbors 
 Cappefra: are you guys doing it recursively though?
 Cappefra: recursion might slow me down
 MSmits: why would we?
 Hjax: no? why would you do that 
 MSmits: the whole idea about monte carlo is that you pick random moves
 MSmits: no need to use recursion for it
 MSmits: in fact, i was going to do beamsearch first and it was too complicated. Mostly because it included recursion
 Cappefra: Ok the way I implemented this idea was calling this randomization function recursively on the new chosen position
 Kellthazar: So everyone in high rank is using Monte Carlo?
 Hjax: no
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: some are
 Hjax: my current bot (rank 110) isnt, my monte carlo bot isnt uploaded yet, nor is it finished 
 MSmits: euler said he started with it and then stopped, which is weird since he always does MC when I don't
 Hjax: although i may replace monte carlo with a different search soon 
 Cappefra: Ok I'll have to think about this and change it tomorrow evening
 Hjax: monte carlo was just the quickest search to write 
 MSmits: I'm definitely not replacing it
 Cappefra: I have to wake up in 6 hours
 MSmits: I like it a lot
 MSmits: it's easy to modify and fast
 MSmits: i have a bunch of low hanging fruit to do instead... like Hjax killing me

 Hjax: lol
 Cappefra: btw I'm doing hungarian algorithm for the first assignment pacs -&gt; superpellet
 Cappefra: if anyone wants to try that
 Hjax: dont lose to my silly heuristic bot 
 cegprakash: what depth do ppl usually do in UTTT using MCTS MSmits
 MSmits: cegprakash the idea about mcts is that depth is variable. Different branches of the tree go to different depth
 MSmits: some branches will be 5 deep when others are 20
 cegprakash: why not maxflow Cappefra
 thethiny: I haven't won a single battle for days now, therefore I can't submit a new bot
 <b>**gh2oost smth</b></p><p><img src="/a/44247984870201" /> thethiny: I wanna sleep 😭
 cegprakash: whats the deepest you'll go and how do u decide depth if the game doesn't ends MSmits
 DollarAkshay: I used MCTS for UTT
 Alshock: The quantit we use to assess mcts efficiency is more the number of rollouts than the depth of the tree
 gh2oost: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 DollarAkshay: I can tell you . One sec
 reCurse: It's also a terrible metric and should stop being used
 MSmits: cegprakash you dont decide depth, it just increases until the game is solved or the calculation time is up
 MSmits: its impossible to give you  a depth really
 Alshock: @reCurse If there's a much better one I want it
 cegprakash: do we do it like a BFS until timeout?
 cegprakash: because dfs can timeout on some stupid path
 MSmits: ow come on dont ping re curse just after someone brings up uttt
 MSmits: thats just cruel
 reCurse: I started
 Alshock: wut? I was answering
 MSmits: oh ok, sorry missed that, tired
 MSmits: 1 am here, needz my sleep
 Alshock: same ^^
 MSmits: Alshock about measuring rollouts, it works as a metric when everyone is more or less doing the same thing
 DollarAkshay: I was 
 MSmits: but when people are modifying their search in all sorts of creative ways, it loses meaning
 Alshock: I must be too stupid to find creative ways to tweak a mcts
 MSmits: they are game specific mostly
 cegprakash: MonZtaDeluxe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9V78UbdzWI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=81</a> 
 Alshock: well your multiple agents is an example I guess?
 DollarAkshay: I am exploring about 135k Nodes on Turn 2 in MCTS ( 100 ms)
 MSmits: for example, in some games its a good idea to do a simulation from each child in a single rollout
 MSmits: that makes rollouts a lot more expensive
 cegprakash: DollarAkshay is it a BFS?
 sunksuperset370: hello
 sunksuperset370: again
 Alshock: I don't agree, that makes N rollouts for just 1 selection
 sunksuperset370: cegprakash
 DollarAkshay: No no its not a bfs
 Alshock: You can't count that as just 1
 DollarAkshay: You search which ever node has the best cost
 sunksuperset370: its me again
 MSmits: if you count it as multiple, then your rollouts get cheaper
 cegprakash: then u might timeout on some stupid path and waste a lot of time
 MSmits: because selection is expensive
 sunksuperset370: so had a big queston
 MSmits: and you're doing it only once
 MSmits: for maybe 10 rollouts
 sunksuperset370: what to we get if we win the contest
 cegprakash: after every 10 nodes u see if this is a okay path
 DollarAkshay: WOW MSmits is rank #1 on UTT :O
 Alshock: Oh so that's not just my selection that's no good, its cost is not supposed to always be neglectible?
 DollarAkshay: Nice
 sunksuperset370: h bhai
 sunksuperset370: he bhai
 Alshock: yeah I'm a real noob for that kind of algorithms sry x)
 sunksuperset370: what do we get if we win the contest
 MSmits: thanks yeah, for about a month or twonow. I dont think anyone resubmitted though
 DollarAkshay: @sunksuperset370 Samsung Monitor
 sunksuperset370: wait really
 DollarAkshay: Yes
 sunksuperset370: are you sure
 lifetimeLearner007: what is UTT by the way?
 sunksuperset370: yourn't not playing with me

 MSmits: DollarAkshay I think there will be
 Alshock: @DollarAkshay i think you can ask them to keep the screen and send you a T-shirt instead
 cegprakash: lot of goodies promised DollarAkshay
 MSmits: it's pretty standard
 cegprakash: for country and school rankings
 MSmits: company i think
 MSmits: not country
 cegprakash: top 100 companies will get goodies right?
 DollarAkshay: They used to give T-Shirts for top 10 before
 MSmits: doubt that it will be top 100
 Alshock: top 1000 players get curved screens right? :P
 DollarAkshay: Dude Top 100 is waaaay too many companies
 MSmits: anyway, I gotta get some sleep, hf&#160;:)
 cegprakash: but lets just say they give goodies for all top 100 so that it reaches codingames' ears :D
 Alshock: GN

 cegprakash: why is ur name prefix Dollar? u earn in Dollars?
 cegprakash: I thought u earn in Rupees
 thethiny: RaCiSt
 DollarAkshay: LMAO IDK its just an old user name
 DollarAkshay: Just stuck with it

 cegprakash: I missed to see ur sad smiley
 cegprakash: when I rekt u at the end
 DollarAkshay: haha
 sunksuperset370: how do we split arrays from a variable that is declared to extract information from loops
 cegprakash: share the ascii value for DollarAkshay will be useful for my bot
 cegprakash: for those smileys

 cegprakash: use diff &gt;= 3 diff &lt;=3
 DollarAkshay: Ehh this copy paste is bugged
 cegprakash: should work better DollarAkshay
 Alshock: @sunksuperset370 which language&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: javascript
 Alshock: well string.split(separator)&#160;? Unless I misunderstood the question
 cegprakash: use -_- only when scores are equal
 sunksuperset370: alshock
 Alshock: sunksuperset370
 sunksuperset370: can we talk in private
 sunksuperset370: like you /join my name
 Alshock: now that sounds hot
 sunksuperset370: no
 sunksuperset370: not that
 DollarAkshay: Sliding into DM's
 sunksuperset370: tyep
 sunksuperset370: just type /join sunksuperset370
 DollarAkshay: Any interesting replays&#160;?
 Maverun: wtf it mean when it said 5526 alone for Temperatures puzzle?
 DollarAkshay: @Maverun Sorry I dont understand what you are trying to say
 DollarAkshay: Which testcase are you failing&#160;?
 Kathrin: sounds like a test case with only one value, namely 5526
 Maverun: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6401a7b6-08cc-4b46-9ff2-dcf1f5dade3e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6401a7b6-08cc-4b46-9ff2-dcf1f5dade3e</a>
 DollarAkshay: @Maverun try this test case15526
 DollarAkshay: Answer should be 5526
 cegprakash: may be Thanos was right
 Maverun: how do i create test case?
 DollarAkshay: Choose Custop
 DollarAkshay: Custom*
 DollarAkshay: Found it&#160;?
 Maverun: ah I am supposed to be in expert mode for custom gotcha

 cegprakash: ^ For you Maverun
 Maverun: what.. is that?
 DollarAkshay: LOL cegprakash XD hes not even asking about Spring Challenge
 Maverun: ah i see, I see my prob, Thanks...
 DollarAkshay: No Problem
 cegprakash: oh no I gave away my simulation testcases
 AntiSquid: now you misguided him so he won't get out of bronze
 Alshock: good job
 cegprakash: somebody said unittests and I wanted to brag
 cegprakash: because I spent time to build testcases
 cegprakash: :D
 AntiSquid: i test if 0 == 0 too
 Alshock: 'member kids, to test is to doubt
 Kathrin: You see me impressed, that you write tests for the simu. I skip that professional but boring attitude for more surprising bugs
 Alshock: Idk how orwell phrased it, infinitive or ing?
 Alshock: @Kathrin then our codes never fail to surprise, that's the real chill of programming xD
 DollarAkshay: MSmits your bot beats me by a huge margin. I always end up chasing your stupid pacs.

 DollarAkshay: The rage emoji only comes when I face you as an opponent
 DollarAkshay: XD
 cegprakash: wait u chase pacs :O now u gave away what u do with ur tracking lol
 AntiSquid: he is offline
 Alshock: never chase unless some heuristic or simu told you that it's a good idea in this specific case
 Alshock: he went to bed about 15 minutes ago
 DollarAkshay: Yeah I have a score for killing an enemy pacman.
 DollarAkshay: Should probably not bother with enemies that have speed ability on them
 AntiSquid: his "stupid pacs", do you think msmits will let you get away with bad mouthing his pacs&#160;? DollarAkshay
 Alshock: those emojis tho
 Alshock: the best invention ever
 DollarAkshay: TY. I would like my Samsung Curved LED monitor now
 AntiSquid: replace the emojis with your avatar
 cegprakash: I have bookmarked DollarAkshay's smiley code
 cegprakash: will add that feature later
 Alshock: You only need three sheets of papers with emojis and I can trick you into thinking that your whole wall is a flat screen
 AntiSquid: uhm is there a list of emojis i can pick from?
 AntiSquid: not sure what's available
 njaber: all Unicodes I guess
 DollarAkshay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.emojicopy.com/">https://www.emojicopy.com/</a>
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://getemoji.com/">https://getemoji.com/</a>&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ok thx
 DollarAkshay: Yeah both are good
 njaber: The coffin emoji for when you kill a pac tho
 AntiSquid: alright i got a really annoying idea for emojis
 sunksuperset370: how does the time out work
 sunksuperset370: this is confusing
 njaber: timeout happens when your code has a crash, or when it doesn't output it's moves in 50ms
 AlluringChair: does anybody know if pacs can see through the teleports? It only says that they have visioin in straight line, so i'm assuming they can
 njaber: they can
 AlluringChair: thanks
 AntiSquid: not all emojis work for me
 njaber: Tell me the coffin works&#160;: (
 DollarAkshay: Make sure you save your file as UTF-8
 BenjaminUrquhart: just don't use non-ascii chars /s
 AntiSquid: well i wanted to output like 5 and rotate them, but i guess i don't shift the string properly <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462410190">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462410190</a>
 AntiSquid: maybe i will add them into an array, shift the array every round and join it when i output
 AntiSquid: this is more important than the contest afterall
 njaber: yeah, seems like some of the emojis aren't supported by whichever font CG is using
 ShlOk: hi
 berries: anybody have any reccomendations for videos or websites i could use to better understand heuristics and bfs
 cegprakash: after a great performance optimisation I get same no. of sims
 cegprakash: or lesser
 cegprakash: wuuut
 pmor: you didn't optimize the critical path
 cegprakash: critical path?
 sunksuperset370: anybody know how to do things in the wood 1 league
 pmor: critical path is the codepath that takes the most time
 cegprakash: okay all my current sims are valid sims
 cegprakash: that makes sense actually
 cegprakash: or not
 cegprakash: may be what u said
 pmor: are you able to identify functions are taking the most time
 cegprakash: I didn't measure each action :D
 cegprakash: but I'm optimizing collision now
 pmor: msvc has a decent profiler
 cegprakash: I use visual studio code
 cegprakash: u mean that?
 thethiny: yes
 cegprakash: how do I use it
 pmor: visual studio 2019
 pmor: not sure if code has one
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/?view=vs-2019">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/profiling/?view=vs-2019</a>
 pmor: also, which language are you using?
 cegprakash: I am using microsoft VS 2017
 cegprakash: c++
 pmor: 2017 has it too
 pmor: its under Debug-&gt;Performance Profiler
 pmor: Though theres little reason not to use vs2019
 thethiny: guys how do you pick what pellet to go to next?
 thethiny: I know you're picking the clsoest one
 thethiny: but if you're doing BFS you need an endpoint
 thethiny: what's the endpoint?
 pmor: Before I rewrote my bot for bronze, I just chose the closest pellet with the highest value.
 thethiny: and then?
 thethiny: currently this isn't satisfactory for me as I have tons of disconnected paths
 tester3: hi
 pmor: that was it.  it got me through the wood leagues
 Durkin: MInes just adding up the total points (or 1/2 credit for non-confirmed points) on a path to a square, and dividing by distance
 Durkin: choose from top given that
 thethiny: thanks
 Kellthazar: Im changing my strategy... After all the big pellets gone, Im using the pellets only for control if the cell was explored or not.
 cegprakash: how do I clear the profiler results before the breakpoint
 Kellthazar: Im tuning my heuristc to prioritize unexplored areas or paths.
 thethiny: I'm doing this now
 pmor: that's not how to profile....
 thethiny: and I got from 196 to 925
 pmor: don't use breakpoints, run in release
 pmor: do the Cpu Usage profiler
 pmor: you want the profiler to collect as many datapoints as it can on its run
 pmor: if you sit at a breakpoint, it will get a lot of datapoints AT that breakpoint
 pmor: Best to have a loop of your code that runs for like 5-10 seconds
 pmor: That should show you your hot paths.  And then you can start diving down into the callstack to see what lines of code are taking the most time.
 cegprakash: I made profiler work
 cegprakash: it found the place where I spend too much time
 pmor: Next step is to figure out why and fix it&#160;:)
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/Sr6jdBG">https://ibb.co/Sr6jdBG</a>
 cegprakash: looks like my eval is too slow
 pmor: you can click into that function and msvc will show you which lines were hit the most
 cegprakash: how
 cegprakash: I don't see anything like that
 pmor: in the function name column, to the right theres a little arrow with lines of code
 pmor: click on that
 cegprakash: I can't find it
 cegprakash: I'm happy with function level
 tester3: Hi from Hawaii
 pmor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/cwj4JDz">https://ibb.co/cwj4JDz</a>
 cegprakash: thethiny u don't need an endpoint
 cegprakash: just BFS to all pellets
 cegprakash: and store difference to all pellets
 cegprakash: and choose the pellet with minimum of these distances
 cegprakash: u run BFS to find the pellet not otherway around
 pmor: for wood league I didn't even do that...I would just iterate over all the pellets and get their manhattan distance
 thethiny: @cegprakash I really don't understand it
 pmor: bronze i'm having to do bfs though
 thethiny: I tried to but I fail
 cegprakash: thethiny say u start BFS from ur current pacman position
 cegprakash: lets call this point A
 thethiny: sure
 cegprakash: u run a BFS until queue becomes empty
 thethiny: how do I run BFS without endpoint?
 cegprakash: now u have distance from ur pacman to every position in the map
 cegprakash: u don't need an end point for BFS
 cegprakash: u only need the root
 cegprakash: just like a DFS
 thethiny: so I just need to visit the adjacent cells?
 thethiny: no endpoint?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: just visit all adjancent cells until u visit all cells
 thethiny: okay makes sense
 thethiny: then okay I get the distances to all pellets
 cegprakash: and never visit a cell more than once
 cegprakash: yes
 thethiny: don;t I have to do this every turn?
 cegprakash: no
 thethiny: why not?
 thethiny: my position changes
 cegprakash: u can precompute this at turn 1
 cegprakash: u can have something like dist[x1][y1][x2][y2] on turn 1
 thethiny: okay and then I just go to the shortest distance from point A at turn 1, right?
 cegprakash: and this distance array never is going to change through the game
 cegprakash: no matter where the pacman is
 thethiny: I lost track
 cegprakash: see
 thethiny: after I finished the BFS, now I have an array of all distances
 thethiny: what's next?
 cegprakash: once u get the board
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8ae27e9-779a-458c-8ec7-3b4afa54c07a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8ae27e9-779a-458c-8ec7-3b4afa54c07a</a>
 cegprakash: something like this
 thethiny: okay?
 cegprakash: now u can compute distance from every point to every other point
 cegprakash: u don't need any pacman position here
 thethiny: ahaaa
 cegprakash: u can store these distances in a 4D array
 thethiny: and since I've done this
 thethiny: all I need is to index it by where I am rn
 cegprakash: yes
 thethiny: since I have this info already
 cegprakash: refer this
 cegprakash: that's all
 cegprakash: makes sense?
 thethiny: does that mean I have to do BFS from every point?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: that's right
 thethiny: I thought that would be computationally expensive
 cegprakash: that still runs in 0.0003 seconds
 thethiny: wuttt
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: u can measure it
 pmor: it is, but first turn you're given 1s
 cegprakash: if u don't believe me
 thethiny: this is a huge game changer then
 cegprakash: it is
 thethiny: there's still 1 issue though
 cegprakash: collisions?
 thethiny: I will send you a replay if you don't mind
 cegprakash: send
 thethiny: frames 26 +<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462442970">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/462442970</a>
 MattP34: has anyone had issues with timing out with python on an input line?
 MattP34: mine is timing out getting the info for the last pellet
 cegprakash: thethiny pellets are not on ur vision?
 pmor: I'm out - @cegprakash - good luck on turbocharging your scoring function
 cegprakash: sure pmor thanks gn
 thethiny: it is trying to go to the closest pellet then once it moves it changes its mind
 thethiny: because the closest pellet changes
 MattP34: here is the code:
 MattP34: for i in range(visible_pellet_count):
 thethiny: nodex[y][x].value
 cegprakash: thethiny u are using manhattan that's why it's not working
 thethiny: not [x][y]
 cegprakash: with BFS distance this will be fixed
 cegprakash: closest pellet will be always the one u are moving towards
 cegprakash: so don't worry
 thethiny: okay
 thethiny: I will try that
 thethiny: thank you very much
 MattP34: the issue I get is the console only print i to visible_pellet_count - 2
 MattP34: so if there are 9 pellets it only does the print statement 8 times
 MattP34: and it happens on random moves not every time
 cegprakash: MattP34 click reset code
 cegprakash: and try with default code
 cegprakash: it should work fine
 tester3: hello world
 cegprakash: and then fix slowly from there MattP34
 sunksuperset370: console.log(Hello World);
 sunksuperset370: lol
 sunksuperset370: this is how you say hello world in javascript
 SurajMishra2209: reset -_-

 Ikhadem: how do you show decision above the pac heads in that animation frame?
 berries: are they coding the boss bots to make them better 
 berries: cuz it seems like its getting harder to beat it 
 kdhakal: how do i change the direction?
 kdhakal: i know about " " and "#" but how do I check them?
 Kellthazar: Change direction?
 Kellthazar: Of the pac?
 Kellthazar: Ikhadem any string appended to the command will be displayed
 Kellthazar: SPEE 1 &lt;MSG&gt;
 Kellthazar: MOVE 1 13 2 &lt;MSG&gt;
 Kellthazar: etc...
 kdhakal: Kellthazar yes of the pac. how do I check for walls?
 Kellthazar: kdhakal, hmmm... you can ignore them
 Kellthazar: I mean, the pacs only see the "walkable" cells...
 Kellthazar: If you tell it to go to a point, the game engine will take care of the movement for you.
 kdhakal: my pac is stopping in the corner:disappointed:
 Ikhadem: thanks
 Kellthazar: Well, in this case, you can check if the pac is in the same place for more than one turn.
 Kellthazar: and tell him to try to go to another direction
 kdhakal: could you explain that in code plz
 Kellthazar: your pacman could be an object, and have two properties: currentPosition, lastPosition
 Kellthazar: even the currentDirection that he'is going
 Kellthazar: if currentPosition == lastPosition
 Kellthazar: try another direction
 kdhakal: thanks I'll try that
 Kellthazar: But this is not the best approach to take this problem...&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: you receive the grid layout on the begining...
 SamuelTheBad: the best approach to the problem is to avoid it happening :wink:
 SamuelTheBad: i say in agreement, having still not implemented any proper pathfinding myself
 Pranab: help any1. how to find if a pac is dead? 
 SamuelTheBad: assuming you're in bronze, you'll have to use the fact you don't receive an input line for a dead pac
 Pranab: okay thanks
 Dav1dS: wow! I added some basic collision detection and avoidance and my rank jumped 200 points 
 thethiny: is there a way to hide the IDE?

 michaellan: a question for those who use another client to view the CodinGame chat: how can I start/view Private Messages with another user?
 michaellan: Do I need to know their numeric ID?
 ABC[]: Hi~ o(*￣▽￣*)ブ
 BlaiseEbuth:  /msg pseudo
 michaellan: what's the pseudo mean?
 BlaiseEbuth: *nick
 michaellan: ok; did you get a message from me just now, I did "/msg BlaiseEbuth just testing" but it showed up on my own status console 
 BlaiseEbuth: Na. /msg nick open a chat with nick, don't put your message behind
 michaellan: I see. I think it worked
 michaellan: thanks
 michaellan: wow, it took several WEEKS for Di_Masta to write his visualization tool
 michaellan: I'm gonna probably have to make my visualizer a lot more sophisticated for Mars Lander
 eulerscheZahl: visuals really help to understand what's going on and spot bugs more easily
 MiyamuraIzumi: 19 on CoC wow
 ProCoder03: are JS the only way to write visualizers are can we write them in any other language&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: any language
 ProCoder03: any easy framework for beginners to begin with in .NET&#160;??
 ProCoder03: I am new to this visualizing topic&#160;!!
 eulerscheZahl: System.Drawing does the job
 eulerscheZahl: System.Drawing.Common for .net Core
 ProCoder03: ohhh.. Okay :thumbsup:

 ProCoder03: Thanks  a lot&#160;!!!!
 michaellan: Oh yeah I saw that GIF, fantastic job with that
 michaellan: also, the strategy of drawing all candidate points and removing them as they went... I read about that years ago on a BoardGameGeek thread.
 michaellan: I will try to dig it up now. the guy who discovered it said it ruined Captain Sonar for him&#160;:(
 michaellan: Also, I had a question that I keep thinking about but forgetting to ask. Is it actually possible to have your bot run iterations of some algorithm / perform some computational work while waiting for your opponent to make their move?
 michaellan: like after you print your move but before you receive next turn input
 jacek: no
 jacek: your process is suspended
 michaellan: ah
 michaellan: :rage:
 michaellan: why are there so many CG tutorials for GA but not for SA
 Westicles: SA is too slow
 Shivay: anyone say where is trivia bot 
 michaellan: aw... now im so confused
 michaellan: re-Curse (dont want to ping him) told me SA was more worthwhile than GA
 Westicles: Tricky autistic wording... I think he hates both
 michaellan: alrighty :cry:
 michaellan: I think SA is simpler for me to understand but there are more tutorials for GA... so the solution is to learn both
 Westicles: SA is awesome for offline optimization where you have time, but rarely is it useful in 50ms scenarious
 Westicles: scenarios
 ProCoder03: whats an SA&#160;??
 ProCoder03: semantic analysis or&#160;??
 ProCoder03: Can we use .NET 5 System.Drawing in Linux&#160;??
 ProCoder03: Anyone&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: simulated annealing
 ProCoder03: ohhh...
 eulerscheZahl: and yes about the Drawing
 eulerscheZahl: you have to import System.Drawing.Common
 ProCoder03: Thanks @eulerscheZahl
 bmacho: draw here on CG?
 eulerscheZahl: offline
 eulerscheZahl: i linked it a bit above already: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885/8">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885/8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: btw there is one game that supports drawing online: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/539734373">https://www.codingame.com/replay/539734373</a>you have to enable it in the viewer settings
 EdwinJagger: I keep getting shortest code on clash of the code
 EdwinJagger: does anyone else experience this?
 eulerscheZahl: modes are selected randomly
 EdwinJagger: interesting...
 EdwinJagger: i get shortest code the most
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have any statistics on what mode is the most common among contributions
 juice0: i'm fairly certain out of my clashes, shortest was the rarest
 -Gamma-: opposite for me
 EdwinJagger: when i first started, it seemed random
 EdwinJagger: but recently it's mostly shortest mode for me
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec55893f-8489-42fa-beec-c25236956c68">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ec55893f-8489-42fa-beec-c25236956c68</a>
 Maxim251: Because of DennisVash, now other peoples are reusing codes, what DennisVash stored in his github page, and they copy and paste solutions and they are gathering points for free,
 Maxim251: where other peoples including me, are hard working on coding to get real achievement not always with high points,
 Maxim251: but that work is priceless, and when I am wondering how other peoples are able get on codingame so big level using so many languages,
 bmacho: yay my first win in clash  
 Maxim251: even if they don't have idea how the code works, it make me crease. Where I work hard on 1 language trying to brake few levels higher, other peoples ere even not using brain and they are on master level, Tha'ts unfair!. And fustrated
 bmacho: and not even a trophy or something for it 
 Maxim251: Because of that peoples, my ranking is lower then I should have.
 Maxim251: Few times I see code copied one from another, I was thinking, wow, this two guys was thinking so simmilar way that they write almost exact same code, now I see that they dig on github and just do copy paste.
 Maxim251: and on ranking they jump to grand master, where i work for mentor for almost a year
 Q12: solving puzzles has no affect on your RANK, just on your PROGRESSION, which cannot be affected by someone else.
 Maxim251: Only what make me happy is Clash of Code, there they cant cheat :D
 Maxim251: Yeah, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/82cadb4735c16364b4979205c954ec051734841">https://www.codingame.com/profile/82cadb4735c16364b4979205c954ec051734841</a>
 Maxim251: on his page when I see achievements and gold level... wrrr
 Maxim251: and ranking rookie...Thats have no sense 
 Maxim251: like my progression looks more like normal, equivalent to my level. 
 Maxim251: #Q12 there are codes to games where peoples for free are jumping on ranking very high.  
 Maxim251: #Q12 imagine how high You will be on ranking, if somebody else will not use copy paste code, it make me angry if I work hard and my ranking is lowered, because of somebody who cheat..&#160;;/
 darthinvader666: why tho
 Q12: As I can see he is publishing the solutions to the practice puzzles only, which have no effect on the RANK, as I said before
 darthinvader666: why does dennisvash have to ruin it
 darthinvader666: oh hes not
 darthinvader666: ok
 Maxim251: he have gold level, I dont, and I feel to be an idiot when bronze level make me a problem
 Maxim251: I want also find my first job on programing, and I work hard to write code of my one, but how I can compare with others if some of them are using copy and paste code?
 Uljahn: paricipate in an online contest
 Uljahn: levels and ranks are here for gamification purposes and have no real value
 darkhorse64: If you really want to improve, do bot programming/ optimization puzzles. You will have fun and learn a lot
 ProCoder03: yeah i second that&#160;!!
 Maxim251: I use on java now one of the code, language on witch I never play, I did that code exam, and copy paste. That game is "The last crusaid 3" Nd now its pops up rank others solutions, what happened, I am ranking up solutions what I did copied, exact this same code, then how I can rank that solutions if 2, 3 or 6 guys have exact same code?
 darkhorse64: There also a few puzzles worth practicing for education purposes: floodfill, breadth first search. You can pass ranking when you see copy/paste code
 Maxim251: IFrom last year, I did cheat only once, when I didnt know how figureout the solution, but because I want find job in my language, and I start learning code in C++ in last year, I try do everything my self. I am proud that i get to that place where I am now. And I know only C++
 darkhorse64: On a personal note, don't copy/paste. You are only harming yourself: you learn nothing and deprive yourself of the joy of achieving something
 Uljahn: agreed
 ProCoder03: Wait why do even accuse others of cheating, it doesn't matter abt others till you are learning something and having fun
 Maxim251: Thats why I am so angry, that someone else have so much points, so big level, and admiring that person thinking, wow, this guy is so good in finding solutions, 
 darkhorse64: There are some people that elevate c/p to an industrial level reaching top 20
 ProCoder03: Just see the cheaters, they are gonna be gurus or grandmaster for few weeks!!
 Maxim251: and then finding out, that he use copy paste just for fun, and probably He get job, because he show on his account that he uses so many other languages... 
 BlaiseEbuth: lel
 ProCoder03: @BlaiseEbuth aren't you a mod&#160;?? 
 darkhorse64: :relaxed:
 BlaiseEbuth: Me a mod? Don't says nonsense...
 Uljahn: just wait for the chat server to reboot...
 ProCoder03: but i remember seeing you as a mod few days ago, that's why....
 jacek: he was a div then
 ProCoder03: div&#160;???
 BlaiseEbuth: int
 ProCoder03:&#160;!!
 t3qnee: hi, i know the all basics of python but i can't even complete easiest quests. What are you guy's suggestions.
 jacek: try easiest puzzle - onboarding, descent, temperatures, horse racing
 Shivay: guys i forgot how to go to trivia bot anyone can say
 BlaiseEbuth: What is trivia bot?
 Westicles: You also forgot trivia bot?
 BlaiseEbuth: It seems so...&#160;:/
 jacek: trivia bot?
 jacek: what do you say, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you should try to have a chance to look at the game
 borrel: @t3qnee  also research the puzzle tags, they will guide you to a basic algorithem
 jacek: like 5% or dissapointment
 Rob022: Use windows 98 like pros

 TheOneCode: is my code somwhere collected?
 jacek: it is saved once you played it or submitted
 jacek: in the history
 Coder_noob001: Where can i find which test case my code havent passed?
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean validators? still in the context of clash of code?
 BlaiseEbuth: Context? There's no such thing here...
 michaellan: Maxim251: high level, low rank = doing lots of practice puzzles but not doing competitive multiplayer activities
 michaellan: low level, high rank (these are the people that are OP) are the ones who are gods at AI/optim
 michaellan: and obviously high level and high rank are OP too
 jacek: oO
 michaellan: hi jacek
 Maxim251: Yes, I am practising, because for each game I am learning something, also I am training my self to get pattern for good programing. 
 Maxim251: And train brain for problem solving issues .
 michaellan: well
 michaellan: i would say the practice puzzles dont teach the same skills as in the bot programming, for example
 BlaiseEbuth: Ponies happen
 michaellan: also... is the reason why GA is faster than SA something to do with AVX/SSE? like parallelizing the members of the population in some way
 michaellan: i guess i have to bite the bullet and learn GA
 DR_IQWDJ: algorithm branch on the main page bronze sertification is kinda too hard for what it represents. the developer "who has mastered fundamentals" would have a hard time trying to solve puzzle of the week
 michaellan: Lol, this puzzle of the week just happens to be bot programming
 michaellan: normally thats not the case
 DR_IQWDJ: just as every other week ive been checking it
 michaellan: well, depends on your perspective on what fundamentals means
 michaellan: but i think you're just bikeshedding here
 DR_IQWDJ: from certification " variables loops conditions"
 michaellan: yeah i dislike the wording used on those certifications
 Sumit-coder: hi anyone up
 DR_IQWDJ: well that is true 
 Maxim251: Like You see on my account, each game what I play, I get skills, that owned skills are from sometimes from weeks of thinking about problem. For each practiced game I am proud to get new skill. That's occupied from hard work, in my case.  
 DR_IQWDJ: gotta learn that minimax thing sometime i guess
 xxd: i suggest you learn MCTS instead
 michaellan: Maxim251: that's great
 michaellan: focus on your own progress&#160;:)
 DR_IQWDJ: okay thanks for directions 
 Maxim251: what is MCTS, sometimes I forget that shortcuts
 Scarfield: Monte Carlo Tree Search
 Uljahn: xxd: i guess SA has only temperature as a parameter while GA has population size, mutation rates, crossover logic and selection algorithms, but GA could converge faster than SA given optimal parameters
 Maxim251: But how I could compare to others? 
 michaellan: Uljahn: yeah but those other parameters are the very things that intimidate me going into this
 michaellan: i guess i'll figure it out
 Maxim251: Oh yeah, 2 days ago helped me friend to explain how mechanics works on search tree, I did disighn my own using vector, because I have more then 2 branches to do, and then I did. And Even my code is not so greate, I am happy of that position what I have now
 Maxim251: I have score of 18.64, place is 2,410 and my ranking is now at 977th/2,334, thats quite and resonable place for me
 xxd: for which?
 Maxim251: ultimate ticTacToe
 xxd: nice
 xxd: what approach did you use?
 xxd: what type of search
 Maxim251: code is not fully working but I achieved to work " Tree search" and now I know how to create one. And my idea to use vector rather pointers was good idea.
 Maxim251: any way it works. 
 Sumit-coder: how you guys are soo good at this
 YurkovAS: mcts + bitboards: great for uttt
 Maxim251: My code is not finish, I get to big mess now, but I use montecarlo tree search from second move from players, and used MAX to chouse the best move for me, 
 BlaiseEbuth: A lot of child sacrifices.
 Scarfield: bribes
 Uljahn: investing a lot of time ofc
 BlaiseEbuth: And goat
 AntiSquid: i thought that's only if you want to be a politician BlaiseEbuth
 Maxim251: because of mess in my program, I did not implemented MIN for opponent, and sometimes my program is using the worst move from opponent to block him, this way I loose, because opponent are chousing the best move... :P
 BlaiseEbuth: The goat sacrifices?
 AntiSquid: the former
 Scarfield: thats bribes
 BlaiseEbuth: childs?
 Scarfield: i've heard its a big thing in politics
 DR_IQWDJ: what is the easier puzzle or game to start learning tree search?
 JBM: MCTS simple exercise ofc
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 Scarfield: Bandas or breakthrough have fairly simple game mechanics
 AntiSquid: yes blaise
 eulerscheZahl: breakthrough + MCTS? does that work well?
 BlaiseEbuth: Can works for everything if you're clear in what you ask.
 Maxim251: #DR_IQWDJ  montecarlo tree search, on wood level You have 1 board, I was learning that my self. Try not to pass that level , because later You will have 9 boards and it will be really hard. 
 jacek: people have some success with mcts in breakthrough, yes
 eulerscheZahl: more than with minimax?
 BlaiseEbuth: They probably sacrified some children...
 AntiSquid: is it a bad idea&#160;? breakthrough and mcts&#160;? if yes why&#160;?
 Scarfield: mcts ept probably(?)
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS shines when it's hard for a human to find any eval
 AntiSquid: and wasn't MCSmiTs using mcts in breakthrough&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: for breakthrough I see how to eval a state
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know what players are using
 eulerscheZahl: except for the NN at the top
 jacek: maybe pure mcts wouldnt work, then its ept
 martinpapa69: what is an ept&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: ept?
 AntiSquid: i messed up my MCTS in breakthrough i am sure . my beamsearch worked 10x better Q_Q
 AntiSquid: even ept was worse
 Uljahn: early playout termination?
 jacek: for bt you can easily use 'extended' solver, using bitboard to quickly solve positions few plies earlier
 YurkovAS: i'm use mcts (ept) in breakthrough
 martinpapa69: you terminate bad rollouts based on some heuristics&#160;?
 jacek: originally in ept instead of playing rollout to the end of game, you play for few moves and use eval to determine the winner
 jacek: most people here go dont rollout at all and use eval directly
 martinpapa69: ahh, ok
 AntiSquid: but still random moves right&#160;? not heuristic selection for moves
 AntiSquid: for the "few moves" in ept i mean
 jacek: could be either. mcts comes with many variations and enhancements
 xxd: ._.
 AntiSquid:  _
 xxd: wonder if its possible to eval a UTTT state
 eulerscheZahl: there are some minimax bots in legend
 AntiSquid: how good are you at UTTT&#160;? 
 xxd: very bad
 AntiSquid: then you can't do it
 xxd: alrighty
 xxd: procrastinating on writing a MCTS solver
 AntiSquid: then find something else to do, meanwhile have a lovely day
 xxd: you too
 xxd: what's a good starting puzzle for GA? I keep seeing the one where a bot tries to find the goal string but that just feels a bit lame to me
 xxd: i guess i'll code that one up anyway though
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't written a single GA here on CodinGame yet :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: search race might be a good candidate
 xxd: wow, really?
 xxd: how about SA?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 xxd: what did you use for Mars Lander optim?
 borrel: game of drones?
 xxd: dang...
 eulerscheZahl: monte carlo with heuristics
 xxd: o
 TobiasA: safe
 borrel: (check the blog)
 eulerscheZahl: heuristics to land and get a 100% correct at least
 eulerscheZahl: then random search to change a few tiny bits of my sequence at a time
 xxd: hmm ok
 xxd: sequence being a list of (angle, thrust) for each  move?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 TobiasA: how long is the sequence?
 eulerscheZahl: until the landing
 eulerscheZahl: the published puzzle solutions can give you a few idea about a good heuristic. you can even try several heuristics to keep the best
 Swyfti: which puzzle is this for?
 StevenV: ML
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hello guys
 xxd: hi
 TobiasA: Hi
 BlaiseEbuth: ML-insta-swifty-bot incoming!
 MiyamuraIzumi: I don't understand what you mean BlaiseEbuth
 xxd: swyfti got code-busted someone elses code for codebusters
 xxd: code-busted for using someone elses*
 eulerscheZahl: code-busted for codebusters? how fitting
 sheaaaaaaaaa: no
 Swyfti: hey
 Swyfti: i just realized that was an unintended pun
 TobiasA: :open_mouth:
 Swyfti: by the way this is not daniel speaking
 Swyfti: NOT
 TobiasA: who is daniel?
 Swyfti: this annoying person who copied code on my account
 TobiasA: reeeeaaaally?
 Swyfti: yes
 TobiasA: :o
 Swyfti: but now he is no mroe
 Astrobytes: Yeah. And my left leg can sing opera.
 Swyfti: left leg can sing opera
 eulerscheZahl: do you sell tickets Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Swyfti: really?
 Swyfti: i mean he does have a penguin father
 Astrobytes: It's about as likely as your 'explanation' for being a big cheater.
 Swyfti: woah dude
 Swyfti: i was not joking
 TobiasA: :expressionless:
 TobiasA: reeeaaally?
 Swyfti: its always very annoying when this kind of stuff happens
 Swyfti: first time this kind of stuff happened to me actually
 Astrobytes: If I had a penny for the amount of times I've heard this excuse I could retire.
 Swyfti: yes, i have heard about that stuff
 TobiasA: :o
 TobiasA: you have?
 Swyfti: of course!
 Swyfti: so this kind of stuff has happened on codingame before?
 TobiasA: what do you think about it?
 Swyfti: me?
 TobiasA: yea
 Swyfti: im just annoyed out of my mind
 TobiasA: teehee:joy:
 eulerscheZahl: if that was this daniel how submitted your codebusters bot - then how about resubmitting your own and getting a rank that you deserve?
 Swyfti: that sounds good-
 Swyfti: reset me on coders strike back please?
 eulerscheZahl: not possible
 Swyfti: yes, coders strike back
 Swyfti: oh
 Swyfti: oops
 Swyfti: then reset me on codebusters
 Astrobytes: copy that one too did he
 Swyfti: no
 Swyfti: there was legit an entire tutorial on coders strike back
 Swyfti: the logic is straightfoward enough
 TobiasA: how did you do yours?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575424162">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575424162</a>interesting messages, aren't they?
 BlaiseEbuth: Another one \o/
 Astrobytes: lol
 TobiasA: well damn
 BlaiseEbuth: Bad bad bad daniel...&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: That Daniel guy sure has been busy
 TobiasA: mhm
 jacek: oh my
 Swyfti: i mainly do clash of code on this account
 Swyfti: just saying
 Astrobytes: "It wasn't me! A big boy did it and ran away!"
 Swyfti: lol
 Swyfti: that is funny because of personal experiences
 Swyfti: guess im doing clash of code for the rest of my time
 TobiasA: why?
 Swyfti: cause its fun
 reCurse: Easier to copy paste too
 Swyfti: actually no
 Swyfti: not in shortest mdoe
 Swyfti: not in shortest
 TobiasA: a cup of copy with pasta
 Swyfti: copypasta
 Swyfti: very funny
 Astrobytes: Almost as funny as your excuse.
 Swyfti: oh my that way, for coders strike back, i just used many if else statements to control my speed
 TobiasA: why did it take you that long to answer:expressionless:
 Swyfti: because there were many other questions to answer...
 TobiasA: yet that's all you could come up with
 Swyfti: i mean its very obvious, is it not?
 TobiasA: so you decided to answer mine last
 TobiasA: how bias
 Swyfti: yes
 Swyfti: sorry
 TobiasA: hm i just realised that that was the only question to be answered:expressionless:
 TobiasA: forgiveness not granted
 Swyfti: acutally no
 Swyfti: there where questions previously in the chat.
 Swyfti: some sentences are indirect questions
 TobiasA: you really like excuses don't you?:expressionless:
 Swyfti: me?
 Swyfti: excuses are everywhere
 Swyfti: for every person
 TobiasA: preach
 Swyfti: preach means pray by the way what do you mean by that
 TobiasA: sorry i was just answering one of the many questions in the chat
 TobiasA: :rolling_eyes:
 Swyfti: preach
 Swyfti: is a verb
 Swyfti: answers are usually explanatory sentences
 TobiasA: preach
 Swyfti: exactly
 TobiasA: word
 Swyfti: its word for word
 TobiasA: facts
 Swyfti: ghosts in the cell and coders strike back where the only two bot programming i did
 TobiasA: what happened to code busters
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: And why have you a bot in mean max? :p
 Swyfti: i do
 Astrobytes: No. That and Mean Max were 'Daniel'.
 eulerscheZahl: that was daniel, you have to pay attention
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :D
 Swyfti: i really want you guys to reset my progress on all other contest
 eulerscheZahl: that's not possible
 Astrobytes: It isn't possible.
 BlaiseEbuth: same
 Swyfti: oh rip&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: (staff could do it but we won't bother them)
 TobiasA: sheesh
 Astrobytes: Delete account.
 BlaiseEbuth: "So sad"
 Swyfti: guess i can redeem myself in the fall 2021 contest
 eulerscheZahl: rumors say you can't
 eulerscheZahl: escape contest&#160;:(
 Swyfti: what rumors?
 TobiasA: noooooooooooooooooo
 jacek: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: we don't know the format of the next contest yet
 Astrobytes: You could redeem yourself by disabling the 'Daniel' bots.
 Swyfti: that is a good idea
 Swyfti: i already did
 Astrobytes: (redeem yourself *a little*)
 BlaiseEbuth: You'll probably have to pay to get someone else solution during FC21...
 Swyfti: i know
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 TobiasA: then i assume you got your money ready
 eulerscheZahl: no, they are on github during the contest too
 reCurse: Easier to redeem yourself by not being a clown
 Swyfti: really?
 Swyfti: well look at this
 eulerscheZahl: but at the end CG does a plagiarism check and removes all of them
 Astrobytes: what reCurse said.
 Swyfti: thats right
 Swyfti: so....
 jacek: better to be a troll than clown eh
 Swyfti: wanna see something?
 TobiasA: word
 eulerscheZahl: yes. that's why i'm watching asterix and obelix right now
 BlaiseEbuth: Keep your dick in your pants! :scream:

 xxd: what is that repo supposed to even mean
 Swyfti: a connect 4 minimax ai made by us
 Swyfti: its not copied...
 Swyfti: SUPRISE
 Swyfti: WOW
 Swyfti: ITS NOT COPIED
 Swyfti: impossible.
 Astrobytes: Clowns++
 Swyfti: um
 BlaiseEbuth: 1 -&gt; Prove that's not a copy.2 -&gt; That doesn't erase the fact you copied on other multis...
 TobiasA: team=[clown() for i in range( num_of_clowns)]
 BlaiseEbuth: 3 -&gt; That's a Ku Klux Klan repo
 xxd: i highly doubt this account "Swyfti" is shared between people
 Astrobytes: Kicks are warnings Swyfti, it means you're on thin ice.
 reCurse: Go get your attention fix elsewhere
 Swyfti: where tho? at least i need a place to go
 reCurse: I don't care
 reCurse: Not here
 Swyfti: not here
 BlaiseEbuth: "Hey hey! How's your attention? Fix it" someone will say.
 Swyfti: alright then...
 Swyfti: guess i will see you at the end
 Swyfti: i mark my words
 TobiasA: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Just do one and stop chatting crap.
 BlaiseEbuth: Las t judgement
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;?
 TobiasA: waaahaha
 TobiasA: he actually said "mark my words"
 idknow: hello
 idknow: how are you doing guys 
 TobiasA: good
 TobiasA: and how do you do?
 BlaiseEbuth: haggis, isn't it?
 EdwinJagger: it'd be cool if we can choose which gamemode in clash of code to play
 idknow: yo boys
 idknow: coding is life 
 TobiasA: is it
 BlaiseEbuth: copying is better
 xxd: pasting is best
 TobiasA: cup of copy and pasta together
 oxydowe: pasting is "Senior developer"
 xxd: EdwinJagger: yeah, like three different lobbies: Shortest, fastest, reverse
 xxd: that would be fun
 xxd: i would die to have reverse-only clashes
 xxd: those are my fav
 EdwinJagger: @xxd yup exactly
 EdwinJagger: like i keep getting shortest mode but I wanted to do more fastest mode
 EdwinJagger: also how do you tag here?
 xxd: you just say the name
 xxd: (accidental tagging is an issue)
 EdwinJagger: xxd I see cool
 xxd: what are you up to?
 EdwinJagger: xxd: i guess like that... but yeah do you know if we can request that?
 xxd: i think its a common request but im not sure they're gonna change it
 EdwinJagger: lol doing another shortest mode... i keep getting this mode a lot
 xxd: i think CG wants you to get better at it&#160;;)
 EdwinJagger: hahahaha
 xxd: what language do you use on clashes?
 eulerscheZahl: you can choose the clash mode when you launch a private clash. but then you have to find the participants yourself
 EdwinJagger: just python for now
 EdwinJagger: might get into ruby but i don't know it yet
 xxd: python is decent for shortest mode
 xxd: if you focus on golfing python you'll learn cool tricks about the language
 EdwinJagger: i've just done so much of it now
 EdwinJagger: i'd rather do reverse mode because sometimes you really have to think about it
 EdwinJagger: or even fastest mode
 TobiasA: how do i make it that numbers from 0-2 are considered 0 then 3-5 are considered 1 and so on without if statements
 TobiasA: question mark
 eulerscheZahl: n/3
 TobiasA: i see
 TobiasA: that was too obvious
 TobiasA: now i am embarrased
 TobiasA: so i have to round up?
 eulerscheZahl: floot. in python it is n//3
 eulerscheZahl: floor*
 TobiasA: c++
 TobiasA: oh yea nvm
 TobiasA: i forgot about floor
 BlaiseEbuth: floor is lava
 TobiasA: jeez i am dumber than usual today
 TobiasA: there is floor in c++ too right?
 eulerscheZahl: at first i wondered if i should answer. or if that was a question for someone else just to test them
 xxd: Oh yeah i had a similar question
 eulerscheZahl: just do an integer division. that's always floor
 xxd: If I can guarantee a uint8_t is in between 0-9, is it faster to divide it by 3 or use a switch-case with 9 cases (hardcoding the division)?
 TobiasA: i was also hesitating to ask the question
 eulerscheZahl: trunc actually
 TobiasA: because it was probably very easy
 eulerscheZahl: that's a UTTT question, isn't it xxd?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know the answer, benchmark it
 eulerscheZahl: or a lookup array as a 3rd option
 martinpapa69: jump instruction is generally slow
 martinpapa69: (return, if else, switchcase ...)
 xxd: ok gotcha
 xxd: yeah eulerscheZahl, was a shower thought haha
 xxd: pondering bot programming in the shower O_O
 Astrobytes: That's common, don't worry.
 eulerscheZahl: branches are fine. conditional branches are the slow thing
 xxd: when are branches not conditional
 eulerscheZahl: during contests you'll lose a lot of sleep if you are only half as invested as some of us are
 eulerscheZahl: while (true)
 eulerscheZahl: always calling a subroutine
 eulerscheZahl: (that is not inlined)
 xxd: i havent done a real contest yet, i'm signed up for Fall 2021
 xxd: it better not be an escape room
 TobiasA: that would be sad
 xxd: I see, that makes sense thanks
 Astrobytes: We live in hope.
 BlaiseEbuth: Escape from CG before it's too late
 darkhorse64: We lived in fear, now we will live in hop
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/3">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/3</a>for context
 eulerscheZahl: and Illedan even liked that post :rage:
 darkhorse64: hope
 Astrobytes: aw, I was looking forward to hopping and giving my wrists a workout :D
 eulerscheZahl: you would totally lose such a contest
 xxd: :rofl;
 Astrobytes: I would.
 Astrobytes: (wrists == ankles for those who don't know)
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 xxd: astrobytes types with his feet
 eulerscheZahl: i always thought wrist = hand, ankle = foot
 BlaiseEbuth: if there is a test with cloves of garlic, you're screwed
 Astrobytes: It's a joke between myself and darkhorse.
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Not if I'm careful&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: :nerd:
 martinpapa69: there should be an error message for exceeding memory limit...
 sheaaaaaaaaa: wtf
 sheaaaaaaaaa: i just got all testcases but still got 0%
 xxd: sounds like you hardcoded
 xxd: 0%?
 sheaaaaaaaaa: it was reverse and i just used elif statements
 sheaaaaaaaaa: does that have anything to do with it
 xxd: lolz
 xxd: nah, that prob just means you didnt solve it correctly
 xxd: did you try refreshing the page?
 xxd: sometimes its bugged
 sheaaaaaaaaa: im going into another game ill check in 5 mins
 Astrobytes: validators&#160;!= testcases
 sheaaaaaaaaa: yeah still 0%
 sheaaaaaaaaa: f
 eulerscheZahl: what were the inputs + outputs you saw?
 sheaaaaaaaaa: its happening whenever i use if and else statements
 sheaaaaaaaaa: im passing all testcases but im still getting 0%
 Astrobytes: are you hardcoding just for the test inputs?
 sheaaaaaaaaa: Yes, are you not allowed to do that
 Astrobytes: You have to solve the general problem.
 Astrobytes: Create a program that solves all cases.
 Astrobytes: Validators are different from testcases to prevent this.
 eulerscheZahl: it's obviously allowed. but it will rarely result in more than 0%
 Astrobytes: ^
 xxd: are a lot of the top ranking players only active during contest seasons?
 TobiasA: dunno
 TobiasA: any ideas on how i should represent the grid for uttt?
 Uljahn: you mean other than bitboards?
 xxd: I use 10 uint16_t's
 xxd: 9 for small 1 for big
 TobiasA:  do you put the 9 in an array or you join them together?
 xxd: yeah they're in an array
 xxd: i think i'd go insane otherwise
 TobiasA: true
 xxd: like its theoretically possible to do it with 2 int64's or something
 xxd: since its 9 * 10 total bits i guess
 xxd: oh wait
 xxd: i sorta lied
 TobiasA: but how do you switch between big and small?
 xxd: when bitboarding, you have two ints, one for each player
 xxd: and for the big board, i have a third int, for tied squares
 xxd: TobiasA: what do you mean by switch?
 Uljahn: if i recall correctly MSmits used titboards<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53708165/bitboard-to-titboard-ternary-bitboard-conversion">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53708165/bitboard-to-titboard-ternary-bitboard-conversion</a>
 TobiasA: wha?
 TobiasA: the hell
 martinpapa69: hmm good name choice
 Astrobytes: only for some parts
 xxd: lol
 xxd: "tritboards" sounds more like it
 Astrobytes: (the SFW version is tritboards)
 TobiasA: i mean for small board the coordinates are from 0-2 and big 0-9 
 TobiasA: so how do convert it
 TobiasA: no how do you use it in general
 Uljahn: modulo and integer division?
 xxd: ahaha i mentioned earlier i bothered to write out some conversion functions
 TobiasA: how did you do it?
 Astrobytes: most probably with modulo and integer division as Uljahn said
 xxd: yeah; <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clbin.com/fu47C">https://clbin.com/fu47C</a>
 TobiasA: oh
 xxd: oh theres some wack debugging comments in there
 xxd: get_move is for displaying my output, get_child is for interpreting the input
 TobiasA: BIGBOI:joy:
 xxd: im pretty sure my get_child function can be optimized somehow but its not that bad
 xxd: and i think i can avoid using loops for get_move somehow
 xxd: CBA to do it; these functions only get called &lt;100 times a game
 TobiasA: thanks i think i get it now
 xxd: yeah, you can probably do better than me in any case
 xxd: i look forward to seeing your UTTT bot&#160;:)
 TobiasA: i look forward to seeing my UTTT bot too:sweat_smile:
 xxd: Does the first-turn=1-second rule apply for all challenges?
 xxd: a lot of games only have saying "&lt;100ms per turn"
 xxd: I am wondering if the first turn rule is implicitly there or not
 chinmaya: hii guys
 chinmaya: where are you from
 chinmaya:&#160;?
 chinmaya:&#160;?
 TobiasA: xxd i don't think so
 chinmaya: tobisia 
 chinmaya: where are you from?
 TobiasA: hover over my profile
 Astrobytes: Yeah, first turn &lt;= 1 s for multis
 xxd: how about for optims?
 xxd: or does optim go under multis
 Astrobytes: Not 100% sure tbh
 xxd: heh. if so, i should change up my CvZ code, although i dont know how much an MC can take advantage of 900ms extra on first turn
 Astrobytes: Don't think it's the same. USer contributed multis may differ though.
 martinpapa69: its so stupid that nn bots play exactly the same game in a 200 round game 3 times in a row
 reCurse: That's why friends don't let friends make games with fixed starts
 MSmits: what could possibly be wrong with fixed starts? :grin: 
 MSmits: martinpapa69, this is preventable by adding some randomness. jace k's bots tend to do this.
 MSmits: as long as the randomness doesn't lead to significantly worse gameplay it should be fine
 martinpapa69: ye ive thought about that
 martinpapa69: randomizing the order of chilren nodes
 MSmits: also be careful about judging when your bot is worse. I think NN creators tend to try different versions of their bot and then keep the one that does best on the leaderboard. 
 MSmits: however, as you said, there is major RPS due to this determinism
 MSmits: randomness removes the RPS, but also removes the advantage of selecting "best out of X" and enjoying it's deterministic winning
 martinpapa69: yep
 martinpapa69: my goal is to make a good alphazero framework atm, idc about the rank
 MSmits: that's a nice goal
 martinpapa69: it would be nice to use top players replays to make an nn based "book" somehow
 Astrobytes: you should definitely talk to MSmits :D
 martinpapa69: ye I've heard he's a fan of...books
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: books yeah!
 MSmits: I'm working on what you are saying martinpapa69 only better. At any time, the current top only samples a subset of good lines of play. You want all of them
 MSmits: my new meta mcts has 10 million games so far, in only a few days
 MSmits: it has no problems getting the tree down to a "solved" state at 36 seeds so it should eventually incorporate all of the top players trees i think
 MSmits: of course, after that, whatever bot that is using the book, is on its own for the rest of the 36 seeds. My 57 GB endgame book will not fit in a bot. I want to train a nn for this part
 martinpapa69: the problem with that is your book contains a lot of states, that never played
 martinpapa69: your nn will underfit imo
 MSmits: not necessarily. It depends on how you select the data
 MSmits: you could play "games' in the book. Giving better moves a higher chance of selection
 martinpapa69: ye if you have a good technique (alpha zero? ) yo ucan solve this
 MSmits: from the book games, you can train a nn
 martinpapa69: sure
 martinpapa69: i thought you want to train with the raw booik
 MSmits: which one do you mean
 MSmits: the meta mcts one or the endgame book
 martinpapa69: the 57gb one
 MSmits: oh, yes, at first i want to try the raw book and i fully expect it to be worse than the process i just described with book-games
 MSmits: but  i have to start somewhere
 MSmits: this is also a way to ease me into nn's. It's not really my thing so i don't want to jump into azero
 MSmits: not any time soon anyways
 martinpapa69: ye its a good idea not to start with az. i worked with nns before, but i had 2 failed attampets before with az
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: all i did was a lot of reading + I converted the xor example to a NN for TTT (not uttt)
 MSmits: it worked quite well, high accuracy and only lost 1% vs random
 martinpapa69: cool
 MSmits: then i converted it to use tf + keras
 MSmits: sooo much easier
 martinpapa69: another good nn-ai practice is dqn
 MSmits: i did nornal q-learning, but not that
 MSmits: normal/simple
 michaellan: are you talking about chess?
 michaellan: what does an alphazero framework mean
 MSmits: not chess no
 MSmits: only re curse is doing chess i think
 MSmits: we're talking about using NN for simpler games
 MSmits: an azero framework is an automated interconnected "system" for self-play, training and testing your bot, then converting it to something usable here on CG
 michaellan: wow, fancy.
 michaellan: that sounds fun
 michaellan: i think i read about an AZ framework on some github repo but I cant recall what it was
 martinpapa69: I've been playing with it for more than a month now. can confirm, its fun
 MSmits: as martinpapa69 mentioned though, better not start with azero. Start with simple stuff that motivates you to keep going
 MSmits: otherwise you're either going to quit because of repeated failure, or you're gonna get something to work, but you have no idea why because you copied a gith repo
 martinpapa69: ye keeping your dopamine level up when trying new stuff is important
 xxd: :sunglasses:
 xxd: i dont think im gonna even be able to dabble with NN in the near future even
 xxd: i have a long ways to go
 michaellan: can a same parent mate with itself in GA? lol
 michaellan: my intution says yes so i'm gonna code it up that way for now
 MSmits: sure why not
 michaellan: might take longer to converge?
 michaellan: possibly
 MSmits: preventing it would maybe cause a slowdown which also may make it take longer
 michaellan: ah that is true too
 Astrobytes: the next generation is made from their children though... so...
 michaellan: hmm... in the Mars Lander article it says "(choosing a second parent is repeated until the chosen chromosome is different from the first parent). "
 MSmits: I guess it depends on the size of the population. With a smaller population, a bigger fraction will be like that
 Astrobytes: Oh right, the best 2
 MSmits: I guess with a bigger population, it would also cheap to check this, as it's just another if/else that is almost never true
 Astrobytes: It's still the best child from the generation + the second best
 michaellan: what with the best/second best? isn't probabilities supposed to be divided proportionally according to their fitnesses?
 MSmits: no idea actually. I thought it was just random
 Astrobytes: You were choosing parents, 2 of those I assume, chosen based on fitness and difference from one another
 Astrobytes: It can be anything
 MSmits: sounds like this is one of those things that's trial and error. Lots of hyperparameters to try
 Astrobytes: Personally speaking, if this is your first time doing GA, I'd create a flat MC to some depth, then introduce mutation, then incorporate features as and when you think you need them
 Astrobytes: It is MSmits. It has an evaluation function. 
 michaellan: how does mutation work with flat MC
 Astrobytes: Mutate your best solution.
 -rudos-: hi
 Astrobytes: According to whatever metric you like.
 michaellan: but...
 michaellan: doesnt MC just generate random paths each time?
 Astrobytes: Yes, keep your best and mutate it
 michaellan: what does "mutate it" mean?
 Astrobytes: You can see how this becomes a population of solutions at some point
 michaellan: is this basically simulated annealing without the "take if worse if temperature is high enough" part?
 Astrobytes: Change something about it, thrust, angle, etc
 michaellan: what do i do with the mutated one? run it again?
 MSmits: mutate is a small change to your set of features.  From what I've heard, some implementations don't use any mutation at all
 Astrobytes: Compare the mutated version with your current best solution, if better, keep it, or keep a pool of them
 michaellan: do i still do the thing where i just make random playouts?
 michaellan: i _think_ i get it, at any rate, thanks guys
 Astrobytes: Yes it's still stochastic in that sense
 PeterBishop: Hello all - I am trying 'Target Firing' in Go and curious why is only takes the one fmt.Printlln statement as input. what am I missing?
 RightHandElf: What's the confusion? You have an encounter against multiple ships and you have to provide one result.
 PeterBishop: maybe too new to Go and this interface. back to Go tutorial and back to this later then.
 theycallmedavid: Is there a way to see the error prints in validation replays?
 sheaaaaaaaaa: how are you graded on fastest
 michaellan: by whoever is fastest
 sheaaaaaaaaa: oh crap i said the wrong thing again
 sheaaaaaaaaa: i meant on reverse
 michaellan: theycallmedavid: if you could, you could just print out all the input given and deduce test cases
 sheaaaaaaaaa: sorry
 michaellan: ah, reverse is graded by time only, so its a fastest minus the problem statement
 michaellan: my GA works on the classic "guess the string" puzzle
 michaellan: lets go
 michaellan: its gonna be a long way to getting mars lander though&#160;:(
 dmin: this site is starting to become really fun for me 
 dmin: great hobby
 michaellan: awesome!
 theycallmedavid: @xxd right, forgot about that
 theycallmedavid: I fail the last validation step in "The Bridge". No idea why. I calculate the chain of commands on first turn. Validation step says timeout. In IDE, all first turns end in less than 1 ms
 xxd: do you have some check in place to make sure it doesnt take more than a second?
 theycallmedavid: No
 xxd: i think its just a really big hidden test
 xxd: i havent tried the problem so i cant say
 michaellan: hmm, the physics sim doesnt actually seem that bad for ML
 xxd: i assume the ship is a point object?
 michaellan: i've only taken physics 1 :cry:

 DrQuarius: crash was due to battery issue, not the website. just wondering if there's a way to find clashes you're currently in somehow on the nav bar
 Wontonimo: nope, not that i know of.  A better solution would be to play a multi bot battle or a challenge on this website
 DrQuarius: that's not a solution, that's just not playing clash of code, haha. Thanks anyway.

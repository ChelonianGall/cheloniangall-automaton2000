 Miki09: fun fact: there are only 5 players using Bash, 2 players using clojure,  3players using D
 Miki09: in the event
 Miki09: So I think Im gonna rewrite my code to D to get "Cherry on the cake" achievvment
 Westicles: this isn't a contest
 Miki09: hmm
 Miki09: so I cant get any achievments from it?
 Westicles: you can ask thib, but I would guess not
 Miki09: ok thanks
 StevenV: this is a contest I think
 Westicles: nah, it is a code event
 StevenV: it is shown in the contest CP points, which should be a contest
 StevenV: you can check that in your profile ranking
 Miki09: But its not in "contests" tab
 Westicles: code golf gets CP
 StevenV: are you saying about green it?
 StevenV: I am saying green-circle, it is in the contests tab.
 Miki09: I mean contests tab in "compete"
 StevenV: check your profile CP ranking
 Westicles: the "start N events" achievement didn't increment like it does with a contest
 StevenV: hmm
 StevenV: I am confused now :D
 Miki09: me too
 Westicles: best to send a notarized letter to CG headquarters and ask
 StevenV:&#160;:.
 StevenV: I would say this is a contest, but how it impact achivement and ranking system is still in question.
 Miki09: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

 eulerscheZahl: guess who ran out of free dynos again
 StevenV: dynos, what is this?
 eulerscheZahl: you need this to host a website on heroku
 eulerscheZahl: 1 dyno = 1h of uptime. you get 550 per month
 StevenV: ah
 StevenV: thanks
 Westicles: oh dear.  how will I check if my Probability for Dummies puzzle has been done already?
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: can anyone help me?
 DaNinja: unlikely
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: i am new to java and i am stuck on one of the easiest puzzles
 DaNinja: whats the problem?
 Aditya19: hey
 Aditya19: What's up party people
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't reply fast enough, so GumBox left?
 DaNinja: guess so
 iggy12345: what does Automated 1 Coding mean?
 iggy12345: does anybody know?
 DaNinja: coding is saved for use in releasing apps
 iggy12345: after I play it?
 DaNinja: after using CI on it, it is saved in your autos
 DaNinja: and can olny be used for app releases
 iggy12345: but I never used CI on it, I played Training, then Coding, Then Refactoring
 iggy12345: My hand ends up with 1 CI and 4 Tech Debt
 iggy12345: my program doesn't detect that I can release app #10 which contains  4 Coding and 4 CI, because Coding is no longer in my hand
 DaNinja: so instead of playing it, output WAIT if you want to use it for release
 iggy12345: I wanted to play it
 iggy12345: apparently I can use it for release even though it's not in my hand
 iggy12345: I think it's a bug
 eulerscheZahl: no it's not a bug
 eulerscheZahl: that's the whole point of automating cards
 eulerscheZahl: you might have used RANDOM to automate something
 DaNinja: ah gold at last, that was a struggle...
 iggy12345: my program can't output RANDOM I took it out
 eulerscheZahl: share a replay if you want answers
 iggy12345: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/646916354">https://www.codingame.com/replay/646916354</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a certain frame to look at?
 eulerscheZahl: the timeout i guess
 iggy12345: I'm looking at frame 69
 iggy12345: starting from frame 66
 eulerscheZahl: frame 57: you print RANDOM. that's how you automate
 eulerscheZahl: the timeout: you have 2 shoddy skills. you need 8 in total. can't release
 iggy12345: I'm working on the timeout part, but I'm trying to figure out the whole code thing
 iggy12345: is this information given in a frame that I can access from stdin?
 iggy12345: how do I know that it's automated?
 iggy12345: oh I see it
 iggy12345: nvm
 iggy12345: okay, so I don't get, why do I need 8 shoddy skills?
 iggy12345: do I have to double up on shoddy skills to release an application?
 eulerscheZahl: you need 8 skills. shoddy or the right ones for your application
 eulerscheZahl: can be 8 right skills or 8 shoddy or 4+4 or whatever
 eulerscheZahl: 8 in total. less shoddy = less technical debt
 iggy12345: I had 2 daily routine stored tho, so that should give me enough? Plus the 1 CI in my hand?
 eulerscheZahl: but you don't have them automated
 eulerscheZahl: only hand + automated matters for release
 iggy12345: then what's the point of permanent daily routine and architecture study then?
 iggy12345: also, where is any of this documented?
 eulerscheZahl: that you have more cards in your hand while starting the turn (architecture) or that you can pick cards from the neighboring desks when moving (daily routine)
 eulerscheZahl: and it's written in the statement
 eulerscheZahl: "DAILY_ROUTINE (2). This is a permanent skill: once played, it stays active until the team has released one application.After moving, the team can get their new skill card from a desk one step away. If you play many cards, their effects will add up."
 iggy12345: okay, that I get
 iggy12345: but where's the whole automated stuff at?
 eulerscheZahl: in the viewer?
 eulerscheZahl: or statement?
 iggy12345: the statement
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+F, "automate"
 iggy12345: where does it say that only automated and hand count for releases?
 DaNinja: in the CI section
 eulerscheZahl: i agree that it could be more explicit
 iggy12345: but the Daily routine says the same lingo as the CI section "Stays active until the team has released an application"
 eulerscheZahl: if you speak Japanese, go to<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tsukammo.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/06/17/032815">https://tsukammo.hatenablog.com/entry/2022/06/17/032815</a>they often explain it better
 iggy12345: I do not speak japanese lol
 jacek: more understandable than statement ;v
 eulerscheZahl: actually your quote is for routine and architecture. not for integration
 eulerscheZahl: look closely
 iggy12345: I know it is, but it's similar to continouous integration, which is what I said
 eulerscheZahl: if you are the alt account of ceg, that's something you have to tell us
 DaNinja: :D
 jacek: Oo
 iggy12345: I'm not? who's ceg
 eulerscheZahl: another user who likes to ask the chat instead of reading the statement
 iggy12345: I read the statement!

 hassanlprogrammerhahah: :worried:
 jacek: for score i bet its trueskill algorithm
 struct: huge lead from 1st to 2nd
 struct: ah i missread
 struct: I thought it was 29 instead of 25
 eulerscheZahl: you surely need some sleep
 struct: I just slept 10 hours euler
 struct: maybe its not enough
 Astrobytes: sleep for 3 days straight post-contest struct&#160;;)
 struct: I just wont come back
 Astrobytes: well, that's an option too I suppose
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i'm not sure how serious struct is with such statements
 eulerscheZahl: don't take the whole legend or delete too serious. stay with us, please
 Astrobytes: Agreed. His trolling is so well-honed it's difficult to say
 struct: Well its just hard for me to cope with it mentally
 Astrobytes: don't stress it man
 eulerscheZahl: it's just a game after all
 Astrobytes: ^not worth torturing yourself over
 eulerscheZahl: do you remember the 5% discussion from last year?i don't remember the exact words, something like "not over-dramatize it, not calling it a contest". i hate to bring this up, but i think i should remind you
 struct: I said that?
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: something along those lines :D
 eulerscheZahl: G-Rom did
 Astrobytes: on discord
 Astrobytes: During the Big Discussion
 eulerscheZahl: written discussion that i was somehow expecting to take place on voice
 Astrobytes: Yeah.

 struct: instead of waiting and completing
 Astrobytes: I have no idea about this game any more
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 eulerscheZahl: i hope it's just hibernating
 Astrobytes: not sure toads hibernate cryogenically
 eulerscheZahl: and yes struct: definitely automate the bonus
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm fine. must be either daiver or ranarama in that picture
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: thanks
 struct: now to change that without breaking the test
 struct: rest*
 actualCoderTrevor: Does it hurt your CP / ranking to join a contest but not participate?
 struct: yes
 struct: yes and no
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh no I better get cracking
 struct: Older contests will give less points for everyone
 struct: so everyone will lose points
 eulerscheZahl: it's not about joining. it's about not playing. you will lose CP for not participating regardless of registration state
 actualCoderTrevor: Okay thanks for that explanation&#160;:)
 actualCoderTrevor: *those explanations
 therealbeef: but doesn't it use only the result from your best 3 contests for ranking?
 MSmits: yes, but your best 3 all get worse
 MSmits: (with each missed contest)
 therealbeef: isn't that regardless of joining
 MSmits: yes regardless
 MSmits: but your new result might replace one of the ones that got worse
 MSmits: if you do join
 MrAZF: hey guys
 MSmits: it will for me for sure
 MSmits: havent had a good contestresult in a long time
 therealbeef: i've never had a good one hehe
 Astrobytes: and you missed at least one
 MrAZF: I have a question
 MSmits: i missed the last one and the witch one
 MSmits: i did oceans and pacman seriously, not sure if there were any others lately
 therealbeef: what made you get hooked for the current one?
 Astrobytes: you did the photosynthesis one right?
 MSmits: oh right that one too
 MSmits: but i was like 100th there
 MSmits: oceans/pacman i had a better result
 MSmits: i am not sure therealbeef
 Astrobytes: sheer willpower and determination I think&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah i think so
 MSmits: i liked the probability part, but my new bot is a mc bot and it's not yet better
 MSmits: so no more fancy probability calculus, just FastRand(x)
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you also get CP when the game comes back as a multiplayer. case closed
 struct: oh my
 struct: top 11 gold
 struct: There is hope
 Astrobytes: you can do it!
 jacek: you need more probability stuff
 Astrobytes: or moar random
 Razovsky: clock is ticking
 Razovsky: jacek the gold boss is your code
 Razovsky: i dont understand sht to what it does
 Razovsky: nothing seems logic yet it wins
 Razovsky: XD
 Astrobytes: Magic&#160;;)
 jacek: i dont understand it either
 Illedan: Me neither
 struct: You dont need to understand
 emh: my sim+heuristic can only do around 50 games per turn so the win ratios are not statistically significant. I failed to optimize prematurely. might have more bugs also, already rooted out quite a few
 struct: 50 games until end?
 emh: yes
 struct: how long is the average game?
 emh: let me check
 emh: I think it's quite high, like 200
 jacek: thats max limit
 struct: too long to get decent results imo
 struct: but I can be wrong
 Westicles: what's the best c++ rand, something with intrinsics?
 emh: I'm not sure but my turns might be 2x though, so 200 means 100
 emh: because I've got "++" two places
 emh: I don't even understand my own code hehe

 therealbeef: define best
 eulerscheZahl: fast, equal distribution
 therealbeef: thats two criteria
 eulerscheZahl: and in no obvious order

 eulerscheZahl: 1,2,3,4,5,... would also fit the first 2 criteria
 Westicles: okay thanks, I tried Xoroshiro and it didn't make much difference vs.  &lt;random&gt;
 Astrobytes: thats the one in the article struct
 struct: ah :p
 Astrobytes: amongst others
 jacek: for simulation this game maybe java random would be best
 Westicles: I mean, it is probably 5x faster but I'm not rng limited
 Sheeesh---: when you use CI it goes to discard&#160;?
 Sheeesh---: can someone remind me
 Sheeesh---: i'm losing braincells
 kovi: sure it goes
 kovi: i mean first played
 struct: it goes to played cards first but yeah
 Sheeesh---: thank you
 BrunoFelthes: The CI goes to played_hand and then to discard, and the other card goes to your automated
 eulerscheZahl: but when you CI on another CI, one goes to automated
 emh: hmm.. I calculated the average game length in a different way and now it looks like it's.. surprise... 42. 42.9 to be exact. while averaging on move phases it looks like 13.9. but these numbers ignore all the skipped phases
 emh: must be something wrong
 MSmits: 13.9 seems fine
 BrunoFelthes: at least at legend, it is 5/6 turn preparing, and others 5/6 finishing
 struct: your heuristics are doing a good job then
 BrunoFelthes: at least, it it my heuristic... preparing for 5 turns, and go crazy for 5
 MSmits: more like go crazy for 11 days tbh :P
 emh: without the heuristic the average move phases is 93
 BrunoFelthes: huhuhua, yes.. this contest, made me crazy.. my MC did not worked, i'm very frustated...
 struct: Sounds about right emh
 struct: I can try my MC if you want
 struct: to check how many move phases I get
 MSmits: my MC didnt work either, i've given up
 struct: same
 MSmits: well it did work, but far from beating my other bot
 struct: yeah it had around 30% win rate
 struct: so not great
 MSmits: did a full sim check, it worked perfectly
 MSmits: i just dont know what heuristics to use
 MSmits: it requires understanding the game
 MSmits: which i barely do
 BrunoFelthes: what are you using MSmits?
 MSmits: my best bot is a full search
 MSmits: of turn 1
 emh: struct if you feel like it
 BrunoFelthes: me to MSmits
 emh: but don't waste time so close to end of contest
 BrunoFelthes: but for the first move, I have a opening book for the first 5 turn... it is giant
 MSmits: does it help a lot?
 BrunoFelthes: i think yes
 struct: its fine emh it will take me 2 minutes
 MSmits: I might improve mine 
 BrunoFelthes: i have a map from the player and me and the cards that i need to opening to get 4 bonus
 MSmits: i have just a few moves
 MSmits: oh I see
 MSmits: I just take 5 in the first few turns and automate bonus, after that it's done by eval
 BrunoFelthes: in general, the game starts is equals...
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i do see why its helpful
 BrunoFelthes: WoW, ValGrowth assumes the leadership... Japan is dominating codingame
 BrunoFelthes: Are they know each other?
 struct: emh 1000 games from the start
 struct: until a player reaches score 5
 struct: number of phases that equal MOVE
 struct: 105.018
 struct: average
 MSmits: btw struct, i started using assert today, quite useful
 MSmits: saved some time finding bugs
 struct: good :p
 struct: yeah

 IvesL: oh i totally missed it last week
 IvesL: but how will the prize be allocated
 IvesL: cuz in kaggle, iirc, only american can receive prize, not sure if it applies similarly here
 struct: no idea
 struct: maybe some countries are not eligible
 IvesL: CodinGame &amp; Societe Generale employees are not eligible to these prizes.
 IvesL: do CG employees actually participate?
 IvesL: never seen one on leaderboard
 MSmits: yeah they do
 MSmits: they usually dont rank very high, but they do
 emh: damnit I don't understand.. I printed the move phases per game and histogrammed it and they are all 16 or more (except one 11) how can the average be lower than 16. must be a calc bug
 jacek: SG Sebatien is in low gold
 MSmits: emh do you take into account the start of the search?
 MSmits: on average your search does not start in the beginning of the game
 emh: I'm just doing the first move now
 MSmits: ah ok
 IvesL: omg
 IvesL: they are so young, i feel so old
 IvesL: really impressive people
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: who are you talking about?
 MSmits: can't be me, I was around in the last millenium
 IvesL: the japanese leading
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: must be the diet
 emh: ahh grrrrrrrr found the bug. was incrementing total in two places
 therealbeef: mostly surprised by the small amount of french in the top of the ranking; usually the top is &gt;50% french i think
 therealbeef: *number
 MSmits: around 50% average 
 emh: 24.26 move phases on average
 MSmits: did you have a bug?
 Nerchio: japan is strong lately in events
 emh: yes in the move phase average calc
 MSmits: ah ok
 emh: but you said 13.9 is how it should be?
 emh: so 24 is way too high
 MSmits: i am not sure what you are measuring. I am just looking at top games
 MSmits: they are not 24 turns long
 emh: I count move phases for both players. are we on the same page?
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: i count them as 1
 emh: ahh ok
 MSmits: problem solved
 emh: nice
 HPQ123: hello worl

 MSmits: well I had a tiny improvement on my bot
 MSmits: found a simbug with asserts
 MSmits: small one
 MSmits: at most it's 1 or 2 ranks prolly
 Astrobytes: asserts ftw
 jacek: print("dupa") debugging is the best
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: nice
 Nerchio: lol xd
 Nerchio: i like print("wtf")
 MSmits: i do this
 MSmits: (as well)
 Nerchio: or print("i am here") XD
 MSmits: yep have done
 Nerchio: well debugging is a little bit of a pain on codingame
 struct: mines are more like

 MSmits: i did that too struct
 Astrobytes: cerr &lt;&lt; "here", cerr &lt;&lt; "here2", cerr &lt;&lt; &lt;expletives&gt;
 Astrobytes: etc etc
 aCat: used it a lot to know where it blows up :joy_cat:

 MSmits: man, you guys are making me feel really unoriginal here
 Astrobytes: sometimes I use a random word like "wombat" for instance
 struct: who MSmits?
 struct: ah 
 aCat: but usually i use some number of xe'es
 MSmits: all of you, literally everything you guys just posted i have used in debug :P
 aCat: or "xxxx" "yyy" "aaa 1"
 Astrobytes: aCat hahaha yes
 _Royale: "here1" "here2" then "here1.1" between?

 Astrobytes: Still waiting for that particular one!Had a lot of others since though
 eulerscheZahl: let's invite you to Germany. and then call an ambulance for something minor and get you checked in the process
 Astrobytes: hahaha health tourism
 Nerchio: germany health care is :100:
 eulerscheZahl: i've read a story of an American travelling to Japan for a heart surgery
 Astrobytes: *healthcare tourism
 eulerscheZahl: while in the US they are like "i broke my arm. but don't call an ambulance, i can't pay that"
 Astrobytes: Sometimes certain specialists are only available in one or more select country so some folks have no choice but to travel, if they can
 Astrobytes: Yes euler, horrific
 Astrobytes: Monetization of healthcare is one of the most evil things we have ever come up with as a species
 struct: what happens if I go visit the us and break an arm?
 Nerchio: I think our species can do worse Astrobytes :joy:
 Crosility: Had to take my child to the hospital for a 104 degree F (40C) fever, a few months ago. Before she turned 2. It cost me ~400 USD WITH insurance. Trust me, America healthcare sucks.
 eulerscheZahl: no idea if my German health insurance would cover that
 Astrobytes: Your travel health insurance will kick in struct, if not, you will have a huge bill
 Astrobytes: Nerchio: well, yes, but the point still stands
 Nerchio: you are from US? you have an UK flag
 Astrobytes: I'm Scottish, in the UK 
 eulerscheZahl: yet somehow a lot of people in the US are against mandatory health insurance
 eulerscheZahl: also those who would benefit
 Astrobytes: It's a "paying for poor people/immigrants" issue euler
 Astrobytes: remember, anything left of centre-right in US is "communist" to them
 a-Rye: So, our ambulance rides alone sometimes cost $4,000 - $8,000, depending on what the needs are. We have government healthcare, but it's slow to catch on. I'm on Medicaid myself and pay the premium when I make too much money. 
 ael-bekk: the boss's score is higher now :disappointed:
 Astrobytes: Terrible situation a-Rye
 a-Rye: One time, my mom drove school bus to take a football player to the hospital, so it wouldn't cost anything. She regularly drove the busses for school events and offered it over paying for an ambulance
 Nerchio: damn legend is 50+ already :eyes:
 Nerchio: nvm
 Nerchio: wrong game
 a-Rye: Meh, it's getting better Astrobytes lol. It could be worse than just paying a lot of money.
 Astrobytes: I guess. I have some friends who do that "informal ambulance" thing with their own van
 a-Rye: Also, if anyone has ideas for character comments in video games, feel free to drop a comment on my playground. I'm adding some basic code to help with generating character messages for game dev tutorial type stuff. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/64843/beginner-python-concepts/example-algorithms">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/64843/beginner-python-concepts/example-algorithms</a>
 a-Rye: I need some funny, serious, catchy, or whatever type messages that NPCs might say to a warrior/hero/traveler 
 DrunkeyCPP: how do I know if I just played coding the previous turn? that is how do I know if I can play 2 cards this time 
 Astrobytes: I'll take a look tomorrow a-Rye
 eulerscheZahl: hasta la vista baby
 Astrobytes: also "groovy!"
 a-Rye: Thanks Astrobytes! I'm being really lazy on here since I started working again 
 struct: DrunkeyCPP I just check which action I outputed
 eulerscheZahl: i can relate, was more active when i was still in university
 Astrobytes: I think a lot of us are lazy on here these days
 eulerscheZahl: coding a bot after coding at work is exhausting. the community feeling of the contest definitely helps
 eulerscheZahl: when you started, it's not even that hard to keep going for me. the first step to get into it is the hard part
 a-Rye: I see all this chat about the card game and want to look at it, but yeah I'm too tired after work to really put in any effort. Still, it's fun to see others doing it
 DrunkeyCPP: struct you store your last move in a global? 
 eulerscheZahl: k4ng0u just 0.02 behind the boss
 struct: I just increase my moves allowed DrunkeyCPP when i output it
 eulerscheZahl: should i store if i have to THROW 1 or 2 cards? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: do i somehow get that in input (current number of cards)?
 DomiKo: nope
 eulerscheZahl: right, opponent might have given one to me
 DomiKo: you always have to throw 2 cards, so you can count how many times you got throw phase
 eulerscheZahl: current == throw, last&#160;!= throw =&gt; 2
 eulerscheZahl: i think i should add this
 DomiKo: yeah
 a-Rye: Done and done, eulerscheZahl has "Hasta la vista, baby" under "eZ"
 a-Rye: and Astrobytes has "groovy" under "aB". Thanks!
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Fame has found me at last
 eulerscheZahl: context?
 eulerscheZahl: what did i sign up to?
 Astrobytes: lol, nothing
 Astrobytes: You gave a suggestion for a game character (NPC) speech
 Astrobytes: For a-Rye's python tutorial playground on techio
 a-Rye: lol sorry, just a mention in my playground. Nothing serious!
 mpt: I can comprehend something in the Green Circle event. When trying to release an app I get "incorrect input" even though I think it is valid. If there is an app that requires 2 skills with a value of 5 and I have 5 bonus cards in hand I should always be able to release it, no? The C++ sample kit also seems to agree with that.
 mpt: 
 a-Rye: And no real name either, hence the identifiers "eZ" and "aB"
 The_Duck: mpt is it the 5th app? that requires you to use no shoddy skills
 struct: mpt replay?
 Astrobytes: ^ your anonymity is safe R**** *******
 mpt: Thank you The_Duck! That is probably it.
 struct: it should be yeah
 mpt: Cheers. Kinda misleading sample code tbh. :D
 Astrobytes: the C++ starter?
 mpt: yea
 Astrobytes: yeah, it is a bit misleading
 struct: nice I bet the boss 2
 struct: I promoted some1
 IvesL: giving 1 skill card to opponent or discarding 2 skill card at admin is a better choice?
 Astrobytes: depends on the skill cards and situation at the time
 kovi: also dont forget, that sooner or later you have to pay the admin toll
 struct: dont forget to pay the mod toll aswell
 Illedan: Don't need to pay admin
 Illedan: If you finish all applications before passing
 eulerscheZahl: "^ your anonymity is safe R**** *******"the number of asterisks adds up :scream:
 Astrobytes: we all did RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: true
 struct: I didnt
 eulerscheZahl: your clear name for a tshirt
 Astrobytes: Yup
 struct: how many games should I do to tell if a version is better?
 eulerscheZahl: offline testing is fairly useless for me
 Astrobytes: still waiting to hear back re. RAIC prize situation btw, from db f or nnovich, I suspect they'll hear something through the week
 eulerscheZahl: i see a strong rock paper scissors effect
 eulerscheZahl: in this case it's ok to ping dbf&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: you were not pinged
 a-Rye: ooh, there's Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard (from Big Bang Theory tv show) on the Code Wars! Just a more complex Rock Paper Scissors algorithm. 
 struct: I think its also here
 Astrobytes: yeah there's a puzzle somewhere
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't call that an algorithm
 eulerscheZahl: more like a relations table
 struct: its more like an AI
 eulerscheZahl: true AI
 Astrobytes: :D
 a-Rye: Oh thanks struct&#160;! I thought there was one here too, but I didn't want to misspeak. Also didn't want to take the time to check, so thanks for the link!
 Astrobytes: Laziness FTW :D
 struct: np is not like I can code with my 4 threads busy
 eulerscheZahl: you can't check with my puzzle search
 eulerscheZahl: ran out of dynos again
 jacek: youre so cheap
 Astrobytes: that, she, said
 eulerscheZahl: in germany credit cards aren't that common. i don't have one and it's the only payment method accepted by heroku
 struct: jacek I just dont upgrade because I get almost the same performance that I get on CG
 struct: same arch
 Astrobytes: The only payment option is credit card? Weird. Excludes me too then.
 jacek: Astrobytes did you know england won world cup in 1966
 eulerscheZahl: vs germany
 struct: arent there prepaid credit cards?
 Astrobytes: jacek: shut up
 struct: Maybe not
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: hetzner has cheap hosting, starting at 4-5 € per month
 jacek: struct yeah i made bigger model but it just plateus
 eulerscheZahl: i would still have to register a domain
 Astrobytes: Honestly, it's all the English talk about because they have nothing else to brag about in football
 struct: jacek dont say that
 struct: Nobody knew
 struct: ...
 jacek: i revealed your secret
 struct: thanks
 a-Rye: I love how global CG is 
 Astrobytes: heh heh, it's quite diverse
 eulerscheZahl: but with disproportional French/European fraction
 Astrobytes: True. Lots from ex/current French colonies though
 MSmits: not today
 MSmits: disproportional Japanese :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: and lots of ex britain colonies eh
 Astrobytes: I'm Scottish jacek
 Astrobytes: and not a Unionist
 eulerscheZahl: no genuinely don't know what that means
 jacek: so braveheart of you
 Astrobytes: I'm Scottish republican (not in the US sense) as in pro-independence for Scotland (and unity for Ireland, independence for Wales)
 Astrobytes: Unionists want the UK/Great Britain
 MSmits: does Northern Ireland want to be one with the rest of Ireland?
 Astrobytes: The opinions are heading in that direction now, post-brexit. Remember, neither NI or Scotland voted for it
 Astrobytes: *nor
 MSmits: ah  I see
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's some complicated match-up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not sure if i should call this luck or skill <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/647480128">https://www.codingame.com/replay/647480128</a>
 Astrobytes: If it's reproduceable it's skill, otherwise luck
 Astrobytes: :P
 Glyptod0n: I think I'm going crazy, I'm just not seeing how this app can be released: Application(id=27, card_needed=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4])While I have: HAND 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1and AUTOMATED 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 Michael_Howard: Either shoddy or bonuses
 The_Duck: yeah you can release with 2 good and 6 shoddy skills
 Glyptod0n: oh wait nvm; thanks guys
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh great, now I'm 19th in silver and have to submit,  y is it so stressful?
 COCIMINO: Hi all, i solve the puzzle but don't understand the mechanism :joy:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm gonna push keelhaul into gold
 PatrickMcGinnisII: who else needs a push?
 eulerscheZahl: he's staff, he probably has a button to push himself
 Astrobytes: in case of emergency last day non-gold: break glass and press red button
 Astrobytes: he improved a lot tho
 BugKiller_328: hi
 BugKiller_328: Can I use external library when I make program here?
 BugKiller_328: for example use numpy in python 
 eulerscheZahl: numpy is supported
 Astrobytes: &lt;faq link here&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>
 eulerscheZahl: haha
 Astrobytes: :D
 BugKiller_328: thank you
 emh: I give up. no Legend for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: push me up Astrobytes
 JoeFather: where can i find some tasty asbestos
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: in the garden shack of my mom
 struct: aCat destroying me, gl
 Astrobytes: the old pub near my local shopping centre
 eulerscheZahl: at university we had 2 identical looking buildings. then they teared one of them down because of asbestos
 aCat: sorry
 Astrobytes: Patrick++
 aCat: it is so concrete around the boss
 struct: its fine, if you are close at the end ill submit
 Astrobytes: Had the same at school euler
 aCat: I'm trying various chancges since 12 hours
 aCat: I was winning against the boss - but nearly never played with him
 aCat: this vesrion seems worse agains boss
 aCat: but is finally in top6
 eulerscheZahl: and in the gym in school we suddenly had plastic cover the whole ceiling
 jacek: 4 wins in a row
 aCat: so maybe I had bad luck in IDE&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: this town is full of asbestos (the bad kind), probably why it's so run down
 aCat: oh man, I wil go pry to RNGsus
 Astrobytes: :D
 aCat: also - I was tewaking against people I was losing
 aCat: and before I ship my improvements they were usually in legend&#160;;]
 aCat: so I was losing heavily against everyone else 
 aCat: ;p
 bi0phaz3: It's nice to still see familiar names after not being on this site for years
 Astrobytes: crusty old users never leave
 jacek: until the chat is gone
 Astrobytes: aye&#160;:(
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/aKjqVV3/akR6LxMd_700wv_0.mp4">https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/aKjqVV3/akR6LxMd_700wv_0.mp4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you have some weird obsession about sharing toad
 eulerscheZahl: i like it
 jacek: :innocent:
 Astrobytes: :D
 iggy12345: why is it that when I send parameters from matches that I had in the arena to my ide, either the bug disappears, or it turns out that I win when I play?
 eulerscheZahl: random opponents or random you?
 iggy12345: oh true, I guess if I did use random that might change it a bit
 jacek: manipulating random eh
 jacek: is it bad that RANDOM uses the game's random instance?
 iggy12345: wait, if I seed the rng, does that effect the opponent's rng too?
 eulerscheZahl: of course not
 eulerscheZahl: that would be horrible
 eulerscheZahl: does the RANDOM command of the game even use random?
 jacek:     public MoveAction createMoveAction(Game game, GamePlayer player) {
 eulerscheZahl: just round it myself. you are right
 eulerscheZahl: found
 eulerscheZahl: game.getRandom().nextInt(Config.ZONES_COUNT-1))&#160;% Config.ZONES_COUNT
 eulerscheZahl: what's that modulo good for?
 mpt: In the Green Circle event, is the number of skill cards left on the locations not part of the input?
 eulerscheZahl: no. add up all the cards in hand, discard, ... to get it
 struct: they are not you need to check the cards given and subtract
 struct: but watch out for the passive skills
 mpt: hmkay, thanks
 struct: like architecture and daily routine
 eulerscheZahl: the permanent skills that aren't permanet
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 DarkHunter98: hello
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: 12 hours left o.o
 aCat: and 4 minutes!!!
 aCat: they may be important&#160;;]
 Astrobytes: and just under 30 seconds
 Astrobytes: 5
 Astrobytes: 3
 Astrobytes: 0
 emh: ok I'm having a glass of white and watching the birds outside and the clock tick
 jacek: white? oO
 emh: wine
 Astrobytes: sounds good to me emh
 JoeFather: oO
 JoeFather: Oo
 Astrobytes: struct: take a lil break, get some fresh air, return reinvigorated
 jacek: dont jacek here
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: not when jacek is here to do the jaceking
 emh: I figure to win I need to either learn probability theory or optimize the hell out of my bot
 emh: but I don't feel like it
 jacek: who needs probability in this game :unamused;
 jacek: :unamused:
 iggy12345: are the applications always the same for each game? If not, are they always the same in regards to the number assigned?
 aCat: they are the same
 aCat: I mean there is pool of 28 apps
 jacek: app id 3 is the same in all games
 aCat: and you have random 12 of them in every game
 eulerscheZahl: there can only be 28. binom(8, 2)
 eulerscheZahl: but they are given in the order in which they are drawn, if anyone still wants to reverse the RNG
 iggy12345: I'm just thinking of devising a way to choose which apps I go for instead of computing a turn distance
 emh: I deactivated my sim and use pure heuristic so at least I have a decent placement in Gold for the end
 Astrobytes: oh the sim didn't work out?
 emh: nope
 emh: I think it's too slow to have enough games to decide what is better
 Astrobytes: keep it for the multiplayer version
 emh: yeah
 Astrobytes: that's what I'll do with my half-written sim code
 iggy12345: dang it, my bot is losing to somebody that's still just using RANDOM from the beginner code
 JoeFather: sussy
 JoeFather: good bye

 Michael_Howard: Highest finish is Gold #6 (twice)
 Michael_Howard: No sleep till legend. And I have work tomorrow. :persevere:
 Michael_Howard: I will get Swift into legend if it kills me.
 The_Duck: in game 1, stacking 2 DR is kinda weird, I've never seen anyone else do that. Then on frame 20 you should automate a bonus rather than taking training. Frame 31 you throw away a CI which you should instead use to automate another bonus. similarly frame 53 maybe consider moving to 7 and automating a bonus
 emh: wow I've been climbing from rank 20+ to rank 10 due to submits
 BrunoFelthes: man, the interface is horrible, to see this decisions
 Michael_Howard: Thanks The_Duck - will check that out.  :duck:
 BrunoFelthes: Michael_Howard,  as player 2, to get legend, I was more greed... at turn 23 for ex, you should move close and delivery an app instead of loop to the training and discard two cards.. but you won this game, why are you looking for advise?
 MSmits: well thats it for me. Out of ideas. I tried everything I could think of, but stuck bottom legend. I think I should count myself really lucky I was able to get past jacekboss
 aCat: oh yeah
 aCat: I'm still below&#160;:(
 Illedan: You can do it!
 aCat: I am trying!
 aCat: thx for support Ille ^^
 jacek: :innocent:
 Darleanow: hey everyone
 Darleanow: i had a question about tower-dereference
 Darleanow: when a tower is already placed so you can't build another on top of it 
 Darleanow: how can you know if u got the error message
 Darleanow: Darleanow: Tile (6/4) is occupied by another tower already
 emh: Darleanow usually you don't know in the code when you get an error, so you need to validate your placement by your code
 Astrobytes: ahhh battles now back at regular contest speed :D
 Astrobytes: maybe not regular contest last day speed but ... hey :D
 aCat: yeah submit is awful
 elderlybeginner: Anyone eager to drop me some tips? It's would be nice to add a few ifs to heuristics and jump into gold.here is an example battle:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/647577587">https://www.codingame.com/replay/647577587</a>
 Aldoggen: lol boss be churning out those apps and racking up the technical debt
 putibuzu: @elderlybeginner try to get automated bonuses, i.e. use CI on bonuses, hold back a little bit on the release for the first few turns
 elderlybeginner: thanks, I will look into that
 Aldoggen: gl!
 IvesL: how can the boss get 5th app with so many debts
 Illedan: Luck
 IvesL: it has less automated cards than mine
 IvesL: and 4times more debt than mine
 IvesL: but that shouldnt just be luck, because i can only win 5% of the game
 struct: so much lag
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e75567b-c6c4-4fe0-b717-d8e548ec2aae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e75567b-c6c4-4fe0-b717-d8e548ec2aae</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ elderlybeginner
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, invalid paste
 PatrickMcGinnisII: elderlybeginner do more CI than arch study, basically
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and try to do arch study on turn 0 as player 0...then CI should come naturally next
 elderlybeginner: PatrickMcGinnisII here is another one:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/647592351">https://www.codingame.com/replay/647592351</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: elderlybeginner try arch on turn 0, whole things will unfold differently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I onlt take debt of 3 or less until score is 3, then I'll take more ... waiting on releases can get u automated earlier
 elderlybeginner: arch disapper with releases, I only play it when score == 4
 Sheeesh---: you can't play training after training?
 elderlybeginner: I'm going with debt &lt; 5, that's not big difference, but I will check
 struct: you can
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I shoudl talk less, my rank keeps going down
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i've done like 4 puzzles during this Event
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: i need help
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: mentally and codingly
 Sheeesh---: you're not alone buddy
 aCat: definitely not alone...
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: There is no Spoon - Episode 1 - java any help?
 struct: There is a contest going I cant help you today sorry
 struct: I remember I solved that puzzle first on paper though, but this was like 5 years ago
 Astrobytes: welcome to codingasylum! I mean codingame! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Astrobytes: we're all crazy cause of the contest GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg
 Astrobytes: it's a tough time to ask for advice on puzzles
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: also btw but my name in a mc server address or join minehut.gg and do /join GumBoxPVP
 Astrobytes: Yeah no we won't do that
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg:&#160;;(
 Astrobytes: I mean, a lot of us are adults
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: i only earnt $10
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: i need more
 Astrobytes: go elsewhere
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: $10 isnt gonna keep me alive
 struct: stop spamming
 Sheeesh---: well that that escalated quickly
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: im spamming?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 struct: Well maybe its not spamming but keep conversation related to programming
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: if you say so....
 Astrobytes: Sheeesh---: interwebz :D
 Astrobytes: It's spamming about your own content so spam confirmed
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: i rlly need help why did they make it so hard
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: its only like the third thing
 aCat: yes Shun_PI please go to legend!
 Kayafu: GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg&#160;: try to use two-dimensional arrays and nested loops&#160;:)
 struct: noo dont
 struct: I had good win rate vs him
 aCat: I have terrible
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: Kayafu i dont even know what i must do
 struct: also kha o must go to legend
 struct: he beats me so hard
 aCat: and since 4 hours I randomly change contsnatns in code
 GumBoxPVP.minehut.gg: i gtg anyways...
 struct: everyone is beating me now o.o
 aCat: any normal changes that seams very reasonable simply does not work&#160;:(
 Illedan: Tell me about it
 aCat: oh - winstreak
 struct: losstreak :D
 aCat: damn below gold boss is so thick
 Kayafu: any tips to beat the gold league boss&#160;? :sweat_smile:
 aCat: be better than him and/or those around him
 aCat: the first is simpler
 Illedan: Need to beat all
 aCat: but you will have no chance playing against him because of hardcore concrete below
 aCat: bad struct&#160;:(
 struct: sry
 aCat: so random here really
 struct: yeah
 aCat: this game is awfully random and rock/paper./scissor
 aCat: so pray to matchmaker
 DomiKo: I still don't know how to play it
 Donotalo: this is a frustrating game for me
 Donotalo: i don't understand what's a good strategy
 struct: Push the boss down
 struct: Im still waiting for recurse NN to beat the boss 100-0
 struct: and promote me
 struct:&#160;:)
 aCat: sounds like a plan
 Astrobytes: lol what
 struct: or maybe daporan
 struct: Someone has to be hiding 
 Donotalo: even the problem description is hard to decipher
 Astrobytes: ain't seen no recurse action round here for a while, I mean he has little recurse to deal with anyway
 Donotalo: i needed 7-8 days to understand it properly
 struct: recurse was online
 struct: 2 days before contest
 Astrobytes: oh really?
 struct: but he didnt type
 struct: my recurse alert allerted me
 struct: "jacek"
 Astrobytes: quietly monitoring things :D
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 Astrobytes: fucking 5th
 struct: mado take me with you
 Astrobytes: fking sorry
 aCat: cat is losing again 
 aCat: and winning again
 aCat: can't we just throw dices
 Astrobytes: hsss meow
 aCat: the same level of competitiveness
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: its painful 
 struct: because I cant even tell what my bot does
 struct: Sometimes is just luck
 aCat: struct you are constantly submitting or parking bot and hoping for push?
 struct: dont know yety
 struct: im trying to improve the bot
 struct: but no sucess
 struct: doesnt help that I need like 1 hour to get to the top
 Illedan: A bunch of local games testing to find 60&#160;% winrate, barely climbs. Changes 1 param randomly by myself. Straight to top 20 -.-
 Astrobytes: to 24?
 Illedan: Hopefully this crashes back down to gold
 Astrobytes: (the param)
 DomiKo: LOL
 DomiKo: how
 DomiKo: I'm stuck at dead last too Illedan&#160;:/ 
 Illedan: I had 1 testgame, looked better than the previous one =&gt; yolo submit
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Param was
 Astrobytes: yolo submits ftw
 Illedan: The 3 was a 2
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: Scoring of the number of bonus cards
 Illedan: In draw + discard + played + hand
 Illedan: As long as it stays above euler
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: separately scoring or all together?
 aCat: BTW - UCB1 helped you instead of random choice in flat MC Ille?
 struct: Try submiting random in legend
 Illedan: No aCat
 Illedan: trainwreck
 aCat: good to know
 Illedan: This is my 2 day old code
 struct: are you using MC aCat?
 Illedan: with fresh param
 Illedan: and bugfix
 aCat: I was suspecting it but who knows
 aCat: yeah
 struct: I tried but failed
 aCat: best optimized c# bits I can
 Illedan: I had a megabug where my enemy had no cards. It was worse to give him all his cards as a draw pile -.-
 aCat: I have nothing better
 Astrobytes: aCat: there is no evolutionary algorithm to work well in this game? I am shocked and appalled! :D
 aCat: ...
 aCat: I try whatever has a chance of working
 Astrobytes: :kissing_cat:
 aCat: BTW I personally rarely use GA on CG
 Astrobytes: just winding you up&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: RHEA only has a few applications here
 Astrobytes: other EAs have applications elsewhere, not sure about on CG
 Astrobytes: but they sure are interesting
 Astrobytes: (here == CG not this contest)
 aCat: I understood
 aCat: hope other reading people also ;p
 Astrobytes: hah
 Astrobytes: DomiKo knows these things
 struct: ok 3 top 10 players submited
 struct: I guess I wait
 aCat: I was trying to find the old version that was winning with you
 aCat: :P
 struct: so i am gona lose vs you 3 now?
 struct: i was alread ylosing vs the other 2
 aCat: no I'm not a robot - i just want to go to legend&#160;:(
 Illedan: 0.05 above euler :D
 Astrobytes: he's gonna love or hate that when he reads the chat log tomorrow :D
 Illedan: I'm not done yet
 Astrobytes: :D
 Illedan: He has more time left than me
 Astrobytes: True, one benefit to his sleeping patterns.
 aCat: ok, good - 4/20
 aCat: if less I'm resubmitting - middle gold is deadly ;p
 Astrobytes: that's 16/20 won?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes u were up to like 4th silver, u just keep submitting?
 aCat: actually this was 20/24
 Astrobytes: Yes Patrick, but it's not the same
 aCat: but yeah, base condition is 16/20
 Astrobytes: aCat gotcha
 aCat: ok, go for a walk
 aCat: I sent version from 13 hours, maybe it will work now ;p
 Astrobytes: lol, gl
 struct: a win vs me = :hammer:
 Astrobytes: :D
 bobth: ** **
 Crosility: I don't know how they considered 1D spreadsheet. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/1d-spreadsheet">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/1d-spreadsheet</a> to be an EASY puzzle. There are medium puzzles way easier than that.
 Crosility: But it's done. Finally... Haha.
 Astrobytes: I think by 'easy' it depends on how you approach it, ie. the optimal solution is 'easy'
 Astrobytes: (don't ask me details, I don't remember, and my brain is mush right now from this contest)
 Crosility: Even the top submitted solutions in C.. at least. Use either enums, or deep recursive functions. Stuff a beginner will probably struggle heavily with. And I understand. Kill it boss! :D
 Astrobytes: don't think I did that puzzle tbh
 Crosility: You aren't listed on a followed player on my list who did it :P
 struct: lol my bot
 struct: (FLT_MAX)*probability;
 struct: I wonder what could go wrong
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: added to TODO_LIST
 Astrobytes: struct :D
 Crosility: Haha. Is that essentially max_random();?
 Astrobytes: genius mistake. I think we've both probably made that one a few times over the years :D
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/647676711">https://www.codingame.com/replay/647676711</a>
 struct: as you can see frame 44
 struct: he goes to training
 struct: because it might have a slim chance to win 
 struct: let me get the&#160;%
 struct: 0.0047619
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: I mean, if you're gonna work with numbers like that, at least clamp to some reasonable value
 Crosility: When you're taking into account cases than happen less than 1/10,000 of the time..
 Crosility: I think you might be optimizing the wrong thing :P
 struct: 1.0 = 100%
 Astrobytes: yes I got that :D
 struct: so it was 0.4% not bad
 Astrobytes: == fking awful
 struct: now I made it flt max only if opponnet has score of 5
 Crosility: Aw, sorry, you said that was the&#160;%. Okay, .4% chance. Maaayybbbee worth it. 1/250... so meh'
 struct: yeah Crosility but i was ahead in the game
 struct: the game should be a victory
 Crosility: I saw.
 Crosility: I just watched it, 5x4. Boss got 1 out at the very beginning, early into the match.
 Crosility: In other news, is "Puzzle of the week" still a thing?
 Astrobytes: can't seem to get higher than 5th silver, should I yolo into the night?
 Astrobytes: Not stressing about it but gold would be preferable :D
 struct: your call
 struct: I will stay up
 Crosility: You want that gold... right?
 Astrobytes: struct: all I will say is don't let it get to you
 Astrobytes: Crosility: heheh yeah, I'll probably eat something again then stay up for a bit, not all night though
 Niicide: you should stay up mate
 Niicide: go all in
 struct: :pray:
 Astrobytes: Once I've had a munch I'll take it from there.
 aCat: :pray::pray:
 Astrobytes: this contest shamed me tbh :D
 struct: Worse odds than lottery
 Astrobytes: lol
 TimeEngineer: Wow I pushed you so much aCat
 struct: push me to TimeEngineer :p
 TimeEngineer: We are quite even struct :p
 struct: true
 oidrissi: Coming guys need some help push me ty
 oidrissi: Just kidding 30 gold it is
 struct: its still a good rank oidrissi
 Astrobytes: it's a feckin hard contest
 oidrissi: Im competitive, legend is still achievable
 Astrobytes: we're all competitive, why we're here right? :D
 struct: petition to bring back fog
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 aCat: TimeEngineer thank you very much :kissing_cat:
 Astrobytes: did you get in?
 Crosility: Hex Grid + Fog!!
 aCat: not yet&#160;:(
 TimeEngineer: I run again
 struct: thanks
 Michael_Howard: Gold #5, 1.3 points from boss. What are my chances if I park there? :confounded:
 TimeEngineer: :thinking:
 struct: Im scared and im at .6
 Michael_Howard: I miss sleep.
 emh: people improved. bumped me down from 10 to 27
 emh: 28
 TimeEngineer: Sorry :grin:
 theycallmedavid: I'm starting to understand the game
 struct: day 12, I'm still trying to understand the rules.
 aCat: ^^
 Darleanow: i gave up 
 Darleanow: this makes no sense imo
 Darleanow: or either explained very badly
 actualCoderTrevor: I'm glad to hear it's not just me
 struct: Finally my bot knows how to open the game
 struct: :P
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/647709211">https://www.codingame.com/replay/647709211</a>
 struct: the start looks decent right?
 The_Duck: yeah!
 ael-bekk: we need mooooore submissions in arena to get the boss down a little
 The_Duck: opening 2 as blue does seem to be out of fashion (though I think it's not terrible)
 struct: What is the trend now The_Duck?
 The_Duck: blue always opens 5 afaik
 struct: interesting
 struct: I think my bot does better with it aswell
 struct: I will try both, thanks&#160;:)
 actualCoderTrevor: I thought I could at least get out of wood 2 today if I tried but it's not looking good&#160;:(
 struct: Takes a lot of time to understand the rules actualCoderTrevor
 struct: The game is pretty hard
 actualCoderTrevor: Yeah I took a few cracks at it earlier in the week but kept getting turned off by not understanding the rules
 emh: struct if you move from 2 to 4 by skipping 3 you block opponent from CI. I'm gonna try a submit your way to see if it's better for me or not
 emh: but changing my heuristic the average game length went up
 struct: I'm going to submit too
 TimeEngineer: Who fed the boss&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: what happened to chilling and watching the league burn emh? :D
 emh: haha I couldn't sleep
 TimeEngineer: 9/5 against the boss not bad :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: at least this bot reaches the top fast
 Crosility: Did he get bigger/evolve?
 Astrobytes: lol, feeding him with points
 Astrobytes: *it
 Astrobytes: anthropomorphized boss ai's...&#160;:|
 Crosility: Lol. You really went there.
 Crosility: It must keep growing!
 Astrobytes: Wait for a rogue CG staff member to email everyone that Gold Boss is sentient and be placed on leave
 Crosility: I really need to solve Mars Lander 2. Because I want to do the optimization challenge for it. But dang - making a decent decision tree for it is proving to be fairly difficult.
 Crosility: LMAO. Google reference?
 struct: nice 2 wins vs boss
 Astrobytes: indeed Crosility
 aCat:&#160;:+1;
 Astrobytes: gogogo struct
 struct: ill stay here pressing submit all night
 struct: if its what it takes
 Astrobytes: haha
 TimeEngineer: What a hero
 Crosility: Gotta mind the sentient AI's emotions. It has been submitting cards by the thousands/sec. Don't want to upset the delicate balance.
 Astrobytes: gotta say, my patience coefficient is not what it was several hours ago
 Astrobytes: *personal patience coefficient
 struct: so close yet so far
 struct: .36
 Astrobytes: oof
 struct: TimeEngineer you said you had good win rate vs the boss?
 Astrobytes: beat the boss and push all your opponents above it
 aCat: yep ;p
 aCat: please
 Astrobytes: victory will follow
 struct: I have 2 - 4 against boss
 Astrobytes: lol aCat
 struct: rest are draws
 Astrobytes: fixit
 aCat: mo versions that beat boss more loses with other players ;p
 struct: I dont even know
 putibuzu: I feel like there are way too few games to actually determine which bot is better since there is just so much randomness
 struct: Multiple games are needed
 Astrobytes: story of my whole contest
 struct: too much rng
 struct: Im playing 400 games per bot locally
 struct: It takes forever 
 struct: the current bot has 54.6% vs 40%+-
 struct: against the previous
 struct: and same rank lol
 struct: But I think this one is stronger
 struct: It climbed way faster
 putibuzu: that is a good sign, I hope youll make it 
 struct: Now I need to figure why I lose this
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/647720423">https://www.codingame.com/replay/647720423</a>
 struct: lol
 struct: from my view is just rng
 putibuzu: opponent has 4 automated bonus, that seems to help a lot for the last release
 struct: me too
 struct: Maybe I should have went to training
 struct: to draw more cards or something
 putibuzu: ah right, didn't see sorry
 putibuzu: yeah maybe
 struct: its fine 
 putibuzu: this game is confusing
 Astrobytes: no shit :D
 Astrobytes: when you think you get it... nope
 struct: So now we have a dilemma on who will submit
 struct: we are all so close to the boss
 aCat: i will probably soon
 struct: wait
 <b>**Astrobytes not included</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: 2 coming
 aCat: ok, thx
 struct: Not my submit
 struct: is just two top 10 players submited
 struct: Lets go Michael_Howard
 elderlybeginner: when to play DAILY_ROUTINE?
 struct: I think I only play it at the start
 struct: when I land on 2
 struct: or if I have nothing else to play
 aCat: ok, some ideas why not to submit?
 struct: wdym?
 aCat: ah they still compute, ok, wait
 struct: yeah
 aCat: and I'm pushed a little
 struct: I would wait
 aCat: were waiting many hours struct
 struct: If Im far away from the boss when they finish
 aCat: but good advise
 struct: and you are close
 struct: ill submit
 Astrobytes: The nobility!
 Astrobytes: another submit with 20 (ie 10) straight wins, bet it ends up halfway down silver
 struct: astro post a replay
 struct: also what search are you doing?
 Astrobytes: im past caring mate, gonna go bed after this one finishes :D
 struct: ifs?
 struct: ah ok 
 Astrobytes: yeah if forest
 struct: cant help much then :p
 Astrobytes: couldn't be assed to finish my sim in silver, thought the ifs would see me through to gold
 elderlybeginner: I'm stuck with ifs around silver 80
 Astrobytes: elderlybeginner: my same code can be at 5th or 55th
 struct: aCat i would wait
 struct: 2 top 10 submited again
 aCat: you are reading my mind&#160;:*
 Astrobytes: top part of silver is all the same score (roughly) and breaking through all of that is not something I succeed at right now :D
 elderlybeginner: nop, there's huge gap beteween 5 and 55 in silver
 Astrobytes: fix a bug, fix something that beats players x, y, and z, lose against a, b, c, d, e, f, g
 emh: struct your 2xDR trick didn't work for me so I reverted it
 emh: or maybe it's just getting harder idk
 struct: what is my 2x DR?
 emh: the replay you showed
 elderlybeginner: and i still have no idea how to handle CI with ifs.
 elderlybeginner: I mead DAILY, not CI
 Astrobytes: elderlybeginner: ok the points have changed a little but honestly, same code 
 Kellthazar: elderlybeginner I'm trying to do that right now :D
 Astrobytes: maybe I'll stay up a liiitle bit longer
 kouin: is it harder to get in legend when youre not like the first 25 people to get in, or it doesnt matter?
 struct: it shouldnt matter kouin
 struct: this time it was only 9 at the start
 Astrobytes: it usually becomes increasingly difficult if you have a sub optimal bot
 struct: in these types of contests I guess its harder
 struct: where rng plays a huge role 
 Astrobytes: yeah
 elderlybeginner: Astrobytes, you're 3 points to the boss. There will be no miracle :joy:
 Astrobytes: im not waiting for a fucking push I'm trying to fix my bugs :P
 elderlybeginner: I find this contest to be top annoying
 Astrobytes: yes it's very, very, very, annoying :D
 Astrobytes: but, weirdly addictive
 elderlybeginner: seems like you found something :joy:
 Astrobytes: don't bet on it, I've had plenty starts like that which end in complete fails
 struct: Daporan reCurse we need help in gold
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 aCat: found small bug
 struct: o.o
 struct: only .22
 struct: 6 hours left
 Astrobytes: - 9 minutes
 Michael_Howard: How much should I worry about getting a captcha? If I in imminent danger of a submission timeout?
 Astrobytes: no, just wait a lil bit in between times
 struct: also you can run out of submits and get a cooldown
 struct: watch out
 Astrobytes: I've had them for days since spamming to get out of bronze
 Astrobytes: just don't get carried away
 struct: hmm new account almost 100% win rate on bronze
 struct: who can it be
 Astrobytes: what's the name?
 struct: Unix10 10
 struct: no space
 struct: might be nothing
 aCat: like 1h without any game for my bot
 aCat: terrible
 khanglovesIT: i found some bot programming difficult. is there any bot programming fits with me (a noob&#160;:))) )? 
 struct: khanglovesIT what do you know about programming?
 khanglovesIT: i know some concepts, but when i look at the instructions, there are a lot of variables, and I cannot keep track all of them. 
 struct: mad pod racing includes an entry tutorial, but the game after is quite difficult 
 struct: Line Racing might be one of the simpler ones I guess
 khanglovesIT: i have done mad pod racing to bronze league, it is understandable.
 khanglovesIT: can you show me the link to line racing
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/line-racing</a>

 struct: :pray: RNG
 Astrobytes: *RNGsus
 eulerscheZahl: on the door to legend
 Astrobytes: omg I'm still awake and you've just got up
 Astrobytes: definitely going to sleep now, that's it :D
 emh: hitting the ice shots cactus and lime to celebrate struct going to Legend
 emh: soon
 struct: I hope I make it
 struct: Today was  a big improvement anyways
 struct: from 60 to 10th to 1st*
 emh: if you give me a good strat to get a lil' bit higher I'll keep resubmitting until I bump you up
 Astrobytes: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm still up as well?
 struct: I dont believe it euler
 Bob_Rocks: euler is still here
 eulerscheZahl: we all know it's not he case :D
 Astrobytes: why do I highly doubt that euler :thinking:
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: emh I  think most strategies you already know of
 struct: most work I did today was make my bot start releasing later
 struct: and improve the opening
 emh: I keep track of opponent debt increase and try to match it
 struct: I decided to watch replays
 emh: and also some other conditions
 struct: I have nothing of that kind
 eulerscheZahl: go struct, you can make it to legend. by just sitting it out
 struct: Only thing I keep track of opponent is his score and is position
 struct: Nah euler I cant go to sleep likes this
 struct: anxiety won't let me
 emh: "I was halfway to Legend when the shots began to take hold"
 struct: I tried to add some probabilities to opponent but only made it worse
 struct: I tried the MC everyone mentioned, it sucked
 struct: at least for me
 emh: for me too
 emh: I recently found a bug, it was rerelasing old apps
 emh: Windows update style
 Astrobytes: was about to say, MicroSoft strat
 Westicles: euler needs to win so he can sell the phone and buy dynos
 Astrobytes: :D
 emh: what he need dynos for?
 emh: on Heroku?
 Westicles: yah
 emh: I was envisioning a hydro plant
 Astrobytes: He's opening Heroku Park
 emh: frog friendly
 Astrobytes: Can't do that without Dyno DNA
 emh: like Jurassic or Xerox?
 Astrobytes: Jurassic
 emh: hehe
 struct: PLEASE
 emh: ok I'll submit struct just in case I meet you on one of the initial 20 battles
 struct: submit a broken bot then lol
 struct: Dont want to risk :p
 struct: im joking
 struct: you dont need to submit
 emh: I did anyway. no hit
 struct: oh aCat is coming
 struct: please dont hit me aCat
 aCat: nice
 aCat: and I have one more thing to code&#160;;]
 emh: ohhhh wowowwowowo
 emh: so high on so low battes
 emh: gz aCat
 struct: why did I lose points with a draw?
 struct: what
 Astrobytes: you stuck a rocket up your bots ass or something aCat? :D
 aCat: if you draw with lower rank
 struct: ...
 aCat: you lose points
 aCat: kind of ;p
 aCat: I mean I know one thing that helped
 aCat: and other I hope didnt broke :P
 Astrobytes: such is the way of bug fixing/adding 'functionality' :P
 aCat: back on #3&#160;:(
 WissarutKongjamnien: oh oh oh
 Westicles: you guys need to pop out and watch the sun rise.  the world is full of old people saying hi to each other
 Astrobytes: huh. Round here there might be a dazed junkie or recently awoken drunk wandering around
 Astrobytes: ugh. Almost broad daylight and I'm almost fully awake again, gonna try sleeping. See ya's
 emh: Astrobytes I pinged u on discord I lost the invite
 struct: gn astro
 Astrobytes: good luck aCat and struct!
 struct: thanks
 aCat: thank you :kissing_cat:
 Astrobytes: emh: no worries mate I'll send it again later for you
 emh: ok
 struct: damn aCat
 eulerscheZahl: taking the promotion all for himself?
 eulerscheZahl: how selfish of him
 aCat:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and a crab and a toad right next to it
 struct: The boss :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: we should add a "no pets" sign to legend
 aCat: i'm still 0.25 off
 aCat: like frogs?
 eulerscheZahl: that was before the sign obviously
 aCat: xD
 struct: This damn boss
 struct: just get close enough Ill push you after
 eulerscheZahl: i think aCat should resubmit right away, this submit isn't going anywhere
 struct:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i like to give bad advice
 aCat: but I'm working on something
 aCat: will submit with improve
 struct: does the improve beats the boss?
 eulerscheZahl: and i want to submit and test something. but i'm too scared of not climbing up to my current rank anymore&#160;:(
 struct: :pray:
 emh: my surfer got his Norwegian flag using Happn
 emh: what we gonna do while waiting out the last 4 hours of the Green Circle guys?
 emh: is anyone still coding bots?
 Sheeesh---: 4 hours more and i'm gonna complete 24 h without sleep
 emh: is there stilll hope?
 Sheeesh---: yes
 Sheeesh---: one variable can change a ton
 emh: really?
 emh: I changed so many variables
 emh: none seem to fit
 Sheeesh---: did you try removing some&#160;?
 emh: yes I removed a whole block of code
 emh: it was for the better
 struct: to submit or not
 struct: that is the question for me
 struct: ...
 Sheeesh---: just keep on trying  4 hours left
 emh: the block I removed was greedy initialization of next move, according to most needed card for apps
 emh: struct just submit. live large take a risk
 emh: how long did it take you to climb there?
 struct: like 15 miuntes
 struct: maybe less
 emh: ok then submit
 emh: you will have more chance if  you keep resubmitting until deadline
 eulerscheZahl: you go first emh
 emh: why?
 emh: I've resubmitted many times
 emh: I'm stable around 28th
 eulerscheZahl: ok, then you've proved to be brave enough
 eulerscheZahl: proven
 struct: Im doing it
 emh: yesssss
 struct: If I dont get it I hope acat does
 emh: let's have excitement
 struct: only 1 loss
 struct: I guess it counts as 2
 eulerscheZahl: in 2h frenchies will wake up and give you some more chances

 emh: ok. the fatboy song it suddenly hit me when I was thinking your name
 struct: lossstreak 
 aCat:&#160;:(
 The_Duck: man the match servers are not very fast right now huh
 Kayafu: We don't get the number of cards left on each place of the board as an input, right&#160;? Or did I missed it&#160;?
 The_Duck: that's right
 aCat: we dont
 The_Duck: you can compute it from the other inputs
 aCat: you have to compute
 Kayafu: ok
 Kayafu: thanks&#160;:)
 The_Duck: don't forget to account for permanent architecture study and daily routine cards
 Kayafu: ok, thank you&#160;:)
 struct: COME COME ON
 struct: Euler how much did you pay your brother to stop me?
 eulerscheZahl: i denied him from TCO finals
 struct: Come on aCat help me out
 HenroLST: lmao whats happening
 struct: HenroLST Im trying to get to legend on the contest
 HenroLST: ah
 HenroLST: whoa hows the text red
 struct: Just write the persons name
 eulerscheZahl: when you get mentioned
 eulerscheZahl: red HenroLST
 HenroLST: ah cool
 HenroLST: fancy red
 HenroLST: quick c++ question, what would be the fastest way to cout a certain amount of decimal places?
 struct: setprecision
 eulerscheZahl: &lt;&lt; std::setPrecision()
 eulerscheZahl: struct knows the spelling better i think
 aCat: trying struct
 struct: std::setprecision(12)
 struct: or w/e number
 aCat: but I have one more thing to ship
 struct: omg
 aCat: and out of ideas then...
 struct: My ideas are changing a number by 0.05
 eulerscheZahl: and just place that inside your streamcout &lt;&lt; setprecision(5) &lt;&lt; number
 struct: pressing arrow up and enter
 HenroLST: but doesnt that also effect the amount depending on the whole numbers?
 HenroLST: like setprecision(3) would be 2.43 and 12.3?
 Rikus: as player 0, is it better to go to Daily+Daily or Continuous+Automate bonus?
 eulerscheZahl: true, no trailing 0 that way
 The_Duck: Rikus automated bonus
 struct: you can also do fprintf it is easier
 HenroLST: ok ill look at it, thanks all!
 Rikus: ty, I have it that way. Asked because the gold boss does the opposite and it got me wondering
 The_Duck: it's also an OK opening, but the top bots seem to start CI as player 0
 struct: top players strategy are completely different
 struct: my strategy is ancient by now
 struct: The go for training on 2nd or 3rd turn
 struct: I guess its a way to manage draw/discard pile
 eulerscheZahl: aCat just making it worse
 HenroLST: oh shoot the events ending
 aCat: my bot you mean?
 HenroLST: thats awkward i was gonna do it but put it off :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: yes. losing more to boss than to struct
 struct: it happens :p
 eulerscheZahl: timer started blinking already
 struct: its not personal 
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: no AI hiding this time?
 jacek: i made my last submit yesterday
 struct: not you
 struct: In general
 The_Duck: jacek are you gonna write up how you trained your bot?
 struct: is royale also NN?
 eulerscheZahl: we will know soon. i bet yes
 struct: yeah its likely
 actualCoderTrevor: How can you tell if a desk is empty before moving to it? Is there a way?
 jacek: i am
 eulerscheZahl: sum up the cards that you and opponent have actualCoderTrevor
 struct: you need to check the cards inputs actualCoderTrevor
 HenroLST: random question, does anyone have tips for how to learn a language?
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh and there's only 5 cards for each skill I see. Thanks!
 struct: be carefull that you need to take into account players architecture anddaily routine
 struct: and subtract those aswell
 aCat: no
 aCat: only autos
 struct: you dont?
 aCat: ...
 aCat: they are just action used and counters
 eulerscheZahl: aCat is wrong
 struct: you need to subtract from them aswell acat
 struct: or you will think the table still has it
 eulerscheZahl: semi-permanent are not on disk and come to your discard on app release
 aCat: hmmm
 actualCoderTrevor: I didn't need to keep track of those at Wood 2 :upside_down:
 aCat: weird
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't implemented that either :D
 aCat: ;p
 actualCoderTrevor: But I just got promoted! First time I've been happy about making it to Wood 1. What a tough game.
 eulerscheZahl: but at least i know it's wrong
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm too scared to submit and lose my rank
 eulerscheZahl: someone push me down so i can submit
 aCat: If I climbed to legend I will do this for you euler&#160;:-)
 struct: I have no idea if I should keep submiting or not
 struct: ...
 eulerscheZahl: wait for fr to wake up
 Sheeesh---: isn't there a full reset euler&#160;?
 aCat: uhh, I forgot wich version was the fast one
 Sheeesh---: in legend
 eulerscheZahl: not fully
 Sheeesh---: wdym&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: your current rank will be used as seeding for match making
 jacek: :scream:
 Sheeesh---: i see
 eulerscheZahl: you still get a top of games to stabilize. but initial placement matters

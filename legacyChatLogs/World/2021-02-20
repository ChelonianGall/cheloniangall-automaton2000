 Sayach8: this constant security check is making me miss out clashes.
 Sayach8: anybody else facing this issue?
 Maexel: Captcha?
 Sayach8: yes
 Maexel: yes, it's very annoying
 Maexel: although I don't get it constant . At times, it pops up before every clash
 Maexel: We might get flagged as bots... :grin:
 Sayach8: i get it everytime&#160;:(
 Maexel: @admins is this a known issue?
 Sayach8: this started  very recently. Did not face this in the begining
 Uljahn: captcha check starts to pop up after a number of clashes played, this counter resets after some time (like 5 hours or a day, not sure)
 Maexel: k, thx Uljahn
 Maexel: good to know
 Maexel: have a good one
 Maexel: need to stop... :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 jacek: happy Caturday

 jacek: oO
 baguettes: Oo
 Robin-Hood: hii

 Westicles: Check on here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/613b8dd7e3f3f21da489c27a933e15d67334533/following">https://www.codingame.com/profile/613b8dd7e3f3f21da489c27a933e15d67334533/following</a>
 Robin-Hood: i think they deleted my account 
 jacek: why
 Robin-Hood: i don't know
 Robin-Hood: jacek
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/6ff5d67fdb8882e6c6cf85b5f0ffd8a06490914">https://www.codingame.com/profile/6ff5d67fdb8882e6c6cf85b5f0ffd8a06490914</a> this one? how many accounts are you making&#160;??
 AntiSquid: do you work for the company Robin Hood or something&#160;? 
 Robin-Hood: hey it not mine i mine the horse is not my avtar AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: aha ok
 Westicles: I got fooled too into following.  Sad
 Innoble: it's a MLP, gotta be jacek's alt
 Ballu-Bhai: i am sad, it was just the sum of digits in reverse mode and i was unable to see it *solution was infornt of me *
 Mahdi_Ghasemi: battl
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: huh?
 baguettes: Oo
 AntiSquid: omg spam
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN ban
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the link in the list of stuff there is nothing to do with the de
 Robinsstudio: eulerscheZahl is so famous
 AntiSquid: i want to play around with something but feels like i need to roll a die and then i am not happy with the result
 AntiSquid: maybe i need to make my own recommendation system :thinking:
 jacek: you flip a coin not to get the result, but to see what result you hope for
 UncleZam: Is this too why Anton Chigurh flipped the coin in the movie..
 ParallaxWave: sup
 Uljahn: just flip one-sided möbius coin with CSB on it
 miejs: Hello, can anyone tell me: is it possible to search for existing clash of code puzzles? I'd like to create one but don't know if it exists already.
 alpha..: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Uljahn: it's ok to make similar clash puzzles just don't copy existing ones
 AntiSquid: nobody created a guess the lottery number clash of code, just saying
 miejs: I already had one rejected because it's too similar to an existing one (even though I think mine is better and following the guidelines, while the other one isn't)
 miejs: So now I want to make sure nothing like it exists before I put effort into a new one
 Uljahn: was it for clash? uniquness is reqired for common puzzles i guess
 miejs: yes, for a clash. and it really was pretty much the same so it was my bad
 zapakh: It's all to do with which three people see your contribution first
 jacek: bribe them
 Westicles: no caesar/rot13, no snakes and camels, and most people don't like ASCII art
 HunterEhrenfeld: Hello Friends
 zapakh: Most people don't like math etiehr
 Noy78: true
 zapakh: Yet I'm doing one right now that's been approved and it's like two pages of storytime
 Westicles: People who do so many clashes that they see the same ones over and over like to approve the ones with long descriptions, it seems.  Gives them an advantage over the fresh fish
 Wontonimo: i made 2 contributions.  One got a lot of upvotes and one got a lot of downvotes.  guess which one finally got approved?  That's right, the down voted one.  Just keep looking for feedback, make modifications.  It can take a couple months
 MasterCoderxD: hi
 Westicles: I'll approve the beach one once you fix the validator
 Wontonimo: Cool!
 Imdone: Hi there
 Imdone: guys i have question about ruby
 Imdone: how can i mix two strings
 tibithegreat: what do you mean by mixing?

 Imdone: but short
 Imdone: i have no idea
 Imdone: tried with zip but didnt workout
 Imdone: im not in clash by the way

 AntiSquid: flatten the curve

 Wontonimo: Okay, I like this tank game that's WIP in contribution.  I haven't made a good bot for it yet, but it's super easy to make an initial bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/869982cfb928e93d4c5e99db05cc2c17b4e83a">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/869982cfb928e93d4c5e99db05cc2c17b4e83a</a> Very friendly to beginner programmers

 darkhorse64: Badly, it's sunny here ...
 Astrobytes: sunny?
 darkhorse64: last week, we had -10, food was frozen on the market, today +15
 darkhorse64: So, I went for a ride
 Astrobytes: Ah. Yeah, we had 40cm of snow, now it's pissing with rain and gale-force winds
 darkhorse64: I am bitboarding the engine with AVX code. masks, shift, shuffle ...
 Astrobytes: Heh heh heh, you wish for a beast of a boss
 jacek: the boss?
 jacek: but struct showed boss can be leaked
 Scarfield: thats sounds like a bossy boss
 Astrobytes: Yes, I would advise some kind of obfuscation unless it doesn't bother you
 jacek: using avx is obfuscation
 Astrobytes: lol, not wrong
 struct: I was not the one who discovered the bug though
 Astrobytes: It was the guy who suddenly went to the top really early in BR
 Astrobytes: Also euler iirc
 Astrobytes: It's a very peculiar 'feature' of their API imo
 struct: I think its a feature that would not take longer than 10 minutes to fix
 struct: But I can be wrong 
 struct: I think it would make a nice calsh
 Astrobytes: From where we're sitting I agree with you
 struct: clash*
 Astrobytes: haha
 Astrobytes: No, new escape room
 dericeketli: gençler
 dericeketli: nabiyorsunuz

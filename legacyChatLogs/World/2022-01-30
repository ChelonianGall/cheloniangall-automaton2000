 ninjadip: is there a hotline for stressed coders
 ninjadip: to keep them from formatting all their drives
 Dren: I don't think they would ever make one
 Dren: the queue to get to talk to someone would just make things worse
 ninjadip: maybe writing the code for the customer service queue would help relieve me lol
 ninjadip: haven't used a good list in a while
 MrZee: I rely on lists a bit too much I think lol
 ninjadip: i'm an array for a known size and vector for dynamic
 ninjadip: but it's nothing big
 ninjadip: i love a linked list though
 Wontonimo: i just learnt the trick of deleting from the middle of a fixed array, so long as you don't care about order
 Wontonimo: swap the last element with the one you want to delete, and keep track that your 'valid' list size is one less
 struct: delete and move the other elements?
 struct: ah I see
 DaNinja: list[i] = list[--size]&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i was like "omg, i've been programming for 25 years and why am i only seeing this now?"
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's a really nice short form DaNinja
 Wontonimo: but i think it is off by one
 struct: why?
 Wontonimo: list[i] = list[--size-1]
 struct: no
 struct: -- decrements first
 Wontonimo: oh, no, you are right!
 Wontonimo: i haven't used it yet.  maybe it'll speed up my uttt bot 
 struct: why would you need this on uttt?
 Wontonimo: children i want to prune
 struct: I see, I dont this at all
 struct: you use mcts too right?
 Wontonimo: ah... nope.  a quick scan of my code and there is no good way of pruning without redoing the architecture
 Wontonimo: yeah MCTS
 struct: there must be some tricks for uttt
 struct: im not aware of yet
 struct: also there must be a few way to make my mcts faster
 Wontonimo: oh, i see a possible optimization now that i was looking for a place to use the delete from list
 Wontonimo: it wasn't a delete from list
 Wontonimo: here i go&#160;!  Was 35th
 struct: did you submit?
 Wontonimo: yup
 Wontonimo: not a bad start
 Wontonimo: it wasn't a huge improvement
 struct: here is my bot with rollouts if you want to check

 Wontonimo: to speed, so probably won't change my rank much at all
 Wontonimo: outch, you crushed me
 Wontonimo: it's pretty late here.  i'm going off to sleep
 struct: gn
 struct: i have to go to sleep to
 struct: 5:38 am
 Wontonimo: it was a fun day of catching up&#160;!  see ya later

 C26_1: Hello every·ªèn
 C26_1: everyone*
 C26_1: Can I ask something?
 C26_1: Which in of these are better in calculating data: Excel or SQL
 5DN1L: You can google to find comparison between the two. For example this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sqlspreads.com/blog/sql-and-excel-why-you-need-both/">https://sqlspreads.com/blog/sql-and-excel-why-you-need-both/</a>
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: I've read that comparision post that @5DN1L gave to me, and I have somethings I want to say
 C26_1: Excel didn't have any variable in Formula Bar
 C26_1: So it's hard to debug
 C26_1: Except if you want to do some coding then yes, Excel has VBA
 C26_1: =IF((F3-E3)&lt;INDEX($I$18:$M$21,MATCH(RIGHT(D3,1),$H$18:$H$21,0),MATCH(LEFT(D3,2),$I$17:$M$17,0)),F3-E3,INDEX($I$18:$M$21,MATCH(RIGHT(D3,1),$H$18:$H$21,0),MATCH(LEFT(D3,2),$I$17:$M$17,0)))
 C26_1: This is an example of a formula in Excel
 5DN1L: keep it brief, don't flood the chat
 C26_1: Notice that I use INDEX($I$18:$M$21,MATCH(RIGHT(D3,1),$H$18:$H$21,0),MATCH(LEFT(D3,2),$I$17:$M$17,0)) in both comparision test and value return if the condition is false
 C26_1: If I can use variable in Formula Bar then of course it'll cleaner
 C26_1: That is one of the major problem for Excel Beginners
 5DN1L: C26_1 keep it brief please.
 C26_1: ok
 5DN1L: in Excel every cell is a variable
 5DN1L: and you can name cells and ranges to make things a little bit clearer
 rendermanGL: SQL for sure.
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, learn about critical thinking
 Automaton2000: ok i suck at them

 jacek: is Automaton2000 written in basic?
 Automaton2000: i think my sim is correct
 emergenitro: hello
 Yass-is-in: guys anyone has a java roadmap 
 5DN1L: yeah, jacek, maybe he did want to learn basic on python :upside_down:
 jacek: nyoro~n
 jacek: Automaton2000 kree java!
 Automaton2000: you know your code is just not good enough

 jacek: Automaton2000 what time of day is it
 Automaton2000: so i do not know how to deal with all the stuff in the ide
 saeed50050: i don't understand battel's questions

 JayBe: Hi. Where can i find the puzzle of the week?
 MACKEYTH: Ugh, I am having an embarrassingly hard time getting out of the Wood league in Ultimate TTT üò©
 5DN1L: JayBe Under notifications
 jacek: wood?
 MACKEYTH: Yes. I've got some logic error in my minimax approach that is making my algo miss losing moves.
 jacek: doint MCTS?
 chneery: im new
 jacek: ahh
 chneery: well im in level 3
 jacek: so it was minimax bugs in atari go then?
 chneery: what
 jacek: hello
 chneery: um are you real
 chneery: or not
 5DN1L: imagine we're real
 chneery: no i mean are you online
 chneery: because im a hacker
 Astrobytes: ahh cg chat
 chneery: im not a hacker
 5DN1L: i'm a mod
 chneery: im just pranking
 5DN1L: i don't tolerate spam
 jacek: how Automaton2000 is real if our eyes are not real?
 Automaton2000: if you mean it was a contest
 MACKEYTH: No, my Atari Go minimax seems to be working as designed. Although it suddenly started playing suicide moves in Wood 3 for some reason. Sigh.
 chneery: ok but are ypkejcdhvpfjhg89perbgvureihpbpgurep
 5DN1L: first warning
 5DN1L: next time you're kicked out
 hashluk: How do I debug procces has timed out in python?
 5DN1L: chneery
 chneery: ya
 chneery: im sorry
 jacek: MACKEYTH it chooses losing move despite there are non-losing ones?
 Astrobytes: either a scoring bug or sim bug
 chneery: :sob:
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, and I don't know how it's doing it. It should be catching and ignoring all suicide moves during game tree generation.
 jacek: minimax even without eval (only win = INF and lose = -INF and rest 0) should be able to avoid those
 chneery: :sob:
 5DN1L: chneery if you don't have better to say please keep silent
 chneery: :sob:
 chneery: are you a real mod
 5DN1L: are you testing my patience?
 chneery: umm why
 5DN1L: i give you some time to think
 5DN1L: you now know i'm a real mod
 chneery: but i want to be mod to
 Astrobytes: :rolling_eyes:
 5DN1L: either useless kick or very laggy chat
 chneery: you see im not at good a coding my dream is to become a master of coding and make a own websit and games
 Astrobytes: sometimes doesn't work for reasons unknown 5DN1L
 5DN1L: sigh Astrobytes
 chneery: but im a noob
 Astrobytes: yeah&#160;:|
 jacek: those canadians eh
 5DN1L: should let canadian mod to deal lol
 chneery: ok but  how you become a mod
 5DN1L: chneery you need to level up
 Astrobytes: by behaving yourself
 5DN1L: chneery you need to level up a lot
 5DN1L: i mean a lot
 chneery: to witch level
 5DN1L: to wizard level
 Astrobytes: Level up so much that Boris Johnson releases a white paper on you
 5DN1L: lol
 chneery: ok but im in level 3
 5DN1L: you'd better solve lots of puzzles here to level up
 chneery: ok but level is the wizard level
 5DN1L: you'll know when you reach that level
 chneery: i dont know
 5DN1L: because you haven't solved enough puzzles
 chneery: i started to play code game
 chneery: ok but how much puzzles
 5DN1L: hundreds
 chneery: like 500
 chneery: or 900
 5DN1L: let's see, i've solved more than 400
 chneery: like what 700
 5DN1L: say 400 ok?
 chneery: 400
 chneery: i said 400
 chneery: so want
 chneery: i mean what
 5DN1L: now go and solve some puzzles
 5DN1L: if you spam here i'll kick you out or even ban you
 chneery: i click the help buttion and it sai type /
 chneery: hello
 5DN1L: link to puzzles is here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 5DN1L: go there
 chneery: ok
 chneery: i did
 5DN1L: solve some puzzles in silence
 5DN1L: hope it works this time
 chneery: i did not i dont know the code
 chneery: im dumb
 chneery: im just a noob waaa
 chneery: why me
 5DN1L: a noob should learn the basics on another website, not here
 chneery: so that means you are baning me
 chneery: noooooooooooooooooooooo
 chneery: waaaaaaaaaa
 5DN1L: i didn't plan to ban you
 chneery: ok
 5DN1L: but if you continue to act so dramatic like this
 5DN1L: i'll have a thought about it
 chneery: can it be a another way
 chneery: or not
 5DN1L: if you wanna learn coding, look for a website to do so
 chneery: but i dont know wich website
 chneery: but can i do commands
 5DN1L: and your dream is to become a master of coding and make your own website and games???
 chneery: ya and be a admin
 5DN1L: then do research on how!!!
 chneery: how on what
 5DN1L: nobody's gonna help you if you can't help yourself
 5DN1L: research on where to learn coding, how to make your dream come true
 charanvir: ok
 charanvir: like what i know hour of coding but is boring
 Astrobytes: aw do one will ya
 charanvir: i whant to know javascript
 charanvir: but can i try the commands
 charanvir: im leaving
 5DN1L: bye, come back when you've learned the basics and learned how to research
 e_fishel: ^
 charanvir: no i did not found a coding think
 charanvir: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 charanvir: but i just want to be a moderator
 MACKEYTH: Hah, found the problem. Wasn't identifying won board configurations correctly.
 5DN1L: you need some more time to think over things properly chneery
 charanvir: is not chneery
 charanvir: its charanvir
 MACKEYTH: There's that debugging feeling again. "How did this ever work at all?"
 Wontonimo: lol
 5DN1L: thanks for telling me you've changed the name while the chat doesn't show it
 5DN1L: kicked
 Astrobytes: MACKEYTH: don't worry, I wasted an hour earlier only to discover my bot was missing the er, while (true) { ... } loop :P
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: i was going to say, who's "charanvir"&#160;?
 5DN1L: sigh
 Wontonimo: i've found clicking on their name and refreshing their profile page helps
 5DN1L: too lazy to do so as it's not that frequent lol
 5DN1L: kicked that person just moments ago using the old name
 MACKEYTH: Ok, Bronze League, here I come, hopefully.
 Wontonimo: what are you playing MACKEYTH&#160;?  puzzle of the week?
 MACKEYTH: UTTT
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: what algo are you using?  minimax, MC, MCTS, GA,&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: Nertz. Still losing sometimes.&#160;:(
 MACKEYTH: Going to use MCTS ultimately, but doing minimax to get to bronze.
 charanvir: i did it
 charanvir: i finsh a puzzle
 Wontonimo: are you using bitboarding or planning on using bitboard?
 charanvir: no im not
 Wontonimo: not you chneery
 Ahmed2k1: hi
 5DN1L: charanvir Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: talking to MACKEYTH who's a *real* programming :rolling_eyes:
 MACKEYTH: I've never used bitboarding before, was planning to store the board as an int array.
 MACKEYTH: Do you think bitboarding it would offer a speed advantage, or just save space?
 Wontonimo: can I share a 3x3 tic tac toe bitboard with you that uses MC&#160;?
 jacek: i store mine as 10 bitboards - 9 smalls and 1 main
 Scarfield: Bitboarding is king, once you get into it its quite fun fiddling with imo
 Wontonimo: it is able to compute 200,000 complete playouts in 100ms
 jacek: bitboard is mostly at least 1 order of magnitude faster
 MACKEYTH: That's impressive.
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, I'd like to see the example.
 Wontonimo: here you go <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS">https://tech.io/snippet/LiWPxTS</a>
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf">https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm%24_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf</a>
 Wontonimo: it may not be in the language you use , but i'm sure you can get the gist of it
 Scarfield: my link is not an example, but a good explanation of how to use bitboarding
 Scarfield: also hi folks
 Astrobytes: Bitfield
 Scarfield: Astrobites
 Wontonimo: thanks for the link Scarfield!!  I've saved it off and will share 
 Scarfield: np its quite nice to get the idea
 Astrobytes: very useful paper that, but only when you get the basics down
 MACKEYTH: Shouldn't be a problem. I can read C++ pretty well, but don't know it well enough to write in it.
 charanvir: hi
 <b>**charanvir slaps  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: can someone put that out of its misery
 charanvir: guys you can use commands
 Scarfield: slap the bass, not the fish
 Astrobytes: haha, fish... bass...
 Scarfield: xD
 5DN1L: one more warning, charanvir, next time you mess around here, you're banned
 jacek: who?
 charanvir: sorry
 charanvir: pls
 charanvir: no
 5DN1L: just stop it charanvir
 charanvir: ok
 Scarfield: autocomplete is not the correct name 5DN1L, but he got the message&#160;:)
 charanvir: but what can i do
 5DN1L: chat isn't showing the most updated name
 Dren: yeah 
 5DN1L: that person's profile is
 Scarfield: oh, my b
 5DN1L: no worries
 charanvir: i wish i can be  moderator
 5DN1L: don't repeat yourself
 charanvir: but is not going to happend
 charanvir: :sob:
 MACKEYTH: Oh, doing bitwise comparisons against a library of winning boards is a good idea. I bet that's fast.
 Scarfield: Astrobytes do you know davie504 on youtube?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield nope
 Astrobytes: bass player?
 Scarfield: i think you will like his "bass slapping", he is a sick bass player, but his videoes has a lot of filler material though
 Astrobytes: all good, I can skip those parts, noted for later&#160;:)
 Shadur: it does get repetitive over time.. same editing, same type of jokes, but as a bass player his top notch
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/ZOiAZlAK3ZE?t=297">https://youtu.be/ZOiAZlAK3ZE?t=297</a>
 Scarfield: yea i skip everything but the playing pretty much
 MACKEYTH: I wish CG supported multi-threading. I'd like to get more practice writing parallel code.
 Scarfield: +1
 Astrobytes: you can always make a local arena using as many threads as you like&#160;;)
 Scarfield: true, never thought of that lol
 Scarfield: trying to get myself into finally learning NNs, would probably be a good time to learn about multithreading the same time i suppose
 jacek: getting into hype wagon?
 Scarfield: thinking about it at least, gonna do it eventually, but havent been much on cg lately
 Wontonimo: MACKEYTH , the code example uses MC, not MCTS.  If your UTTT bot is optimized enough then MC is good enough to get you to gold
 Wontonimo: For Spring Challenge 2021, MC got my bot to Legend.  It isn't the strongest search in town but it is dead simple to code
 Wontonimo: and the code is reusable for implementing MCTS
 MACKEYTH: I haven't messed with my Spring 2021 bot since I got it to silver. It was my first MCTS.
 MACKEYTH: No, wait, that was my Fall 2020 bot. My Spring 2021 bot was if-then. Made it to Gold, though.
 MACKEYTH: How is MC different from MCTS?
 Astrobytes: flat vs building a tree
 Astrobytes: you don't build and use a tree with flat MC, you do with MCTS
 Astrobytes: since you need the node stats in MCTS
 MACKEYTH: MC just tries random playouts and remembers the best one?
 Astrobytes: yep
 MACKEYTH: Incroyable. I can't believe that works. Seems like it would be prone to picking unlikely wins from largely negative game states.
 charanvir: 24x2=48
 5DN1L: coming back with spam doesn't look good
 5DN1L: time to ban for good
 Wontonimo: good call
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: the intro to ML video you posted for struc t last night was really well done, great example
 Wontonimo: oh, thanks
 MACKEYTH: I'm still trying to figure out how to get some control over Java garbage collection.
 Scarfield: what link? :innocent:
 Wontonimo: i didn't have a script for the last bit about minimax and just winged it.  blekgh ... didn't really turn out.
 Astrobytes: doesn't matter, the important parts were clear as day
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUPFOFbCeFI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUPFOFbCeFI</a>
 MACKEYTH: My Atari Go 9x9 bot showed a huge amount of variation in how far ahead it could build its tree;
 Scarfield: wait, this is your video?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Scarfield: cool!
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 MACKEYTH: I can confirm that making all your variables global is _bad_.
 Scarfield: subbed&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: wow, my 3rd sub!  you and my two kids :tada:
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: it says 73 subs though, mr. humble :p
 Wontonimo: :O
 Wontonimo: i haven't posted for a year
 Astrobytes: and I subbed this morning
 Astrobytes: no, this afternoon
 Scarfield: soon to surpass pwediepie
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Scarfield: pew pew
 Scarfield: hmm you dont sound canadian :thinking:
 Astrobytes: yes he doesss
 Wontonimo: really?
 Astrobytes: listen for aboot
 Scarfield: xD
 Wontonimo: har har
 Astrobytes: no shame in that, us Scots say aboot too
 Astrobytes: oot and aboot in ma boat
 Wontonimo: we say sorry a lot.  it's no joke.  When Canada takes over the world the everybody will be sorry
 Wontonimo: *then
 Scarfield: you, for one, have a pretty thick accent astro :p
 Astrobytes: lol thanks :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol Wontonimo, we do it here too
 Astrobytes: perhaps not quite to Canadian level but still high
 Scarfield: have you used ML on CG wonto?
 MACKEYTH: ML?
 Wontonimo: Machine Learning
 Wontonimo: nope, not yet Scarfield
 Scarfield: rgr
 Scarfield: cool video though&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: I did play around with trying to learn position weights for UTTT.  It didn't help that I could find.
 Astrobytes: probably more 'user-friendly' games to try other than UTTT
 Scarfield: ^
 Wontonimo: absolutely
 justchris: im trying to do connect-4 with ML
 justchris: in javascri√•t
 justchris: javascript
 justchris: im ML absolute beginner
 Scarfield: javascri√•t :scream:
 struct: the connect 4 here?
 struct: or just a side project?
 Wontonimo: what ML are you using?  NN, random forest,&#160;?
 justchris: on here
 justchris: brain.js
 justchris: NN
 justchris: i have an ambition to replicate a very simple version of AlphaZero but maybe I can't do it
 justchris: did u guys use Monte carlo tree search?
 Wontonimo: cool.  CG (this site) does not support multithreading or GPU btw
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: yes
 Astrobytes: yes
 justchris: do u have any recommendations on puzzles/bot game to learn MCTS?
 Wontonimo: (anyone with a bot in Legend in Ultimate Tic Tac Toe used MCTS)
 struct: c4
 Wontonimo: yeah, Connect 4 is a good suggestion
 struct: or just try it on normal tic tac toe
 justchris: maybe i should do it first with MCTS then try to  improve with ML
 struct: its easy to tell if its working or not
 Astrobytes: most of the simpler board games tbh
 Astrobytes: yeah TTT
 justchris: i made a working XOR that works in the CG IDE
 justchris: in 200 lines
 Wontonimo: try using your bains.js on Mad Pod Racing&#160;!
 justchris: (if any js coders wanna talk)
 justchris: yeah but that will probably take a few more months to do
 justchris: optimistically
 Wontonimo: something some people here have had some success with is using a NN to estimate the value of the board for one player.  Combine that with minimax and you'll probably do really well
 justchris: on c4?
 Wontonimo: iin general
 Astrobytes: many board games including c4
 justchris: cool, will look it up
 justchris: thanks
 Wontonimo: there are two really good articles here on CG about getting started with NNs on this platform<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/b51fdf068b6dce96d27cc71eb133ffe113695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs">https://tech.io/playgrounds/b51fdf068b6dce96d27cc71eb133ffe113695/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs</a>and<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a>
 Wontonimo:&#160;?? wrong link for the 2nd
 justchris: yeah what i did is pretty much the same as the XOR
 justchris: i followed ur suggestion from last time and tried to tackle a more simple problem
 justchris: now i feel that my lack of understanding MCTS(and Minimax) is holding me back
 justchris: what are you guys working on?
 Astrobytes: 2048
 Wontonimo: a roguelike
 Wontonimo: and getting feedback for WFC
 Wontonimo: trying to make it a more approachable puzzle
 Astrobytes: shazbot, I forgot about the roguelike code, well, I have plenty time
 Wontonimo: is that a Starbuck reference?  that little robot thing that was so stupid 
 Astrobytes: nah, Mork &amp; Mindy
 MACKEYTH: I'm working on an item identifier tool for Nethack.
 Astrobytes: aw nice!
 MACKEYTH: I've been doing it by spreadsheet for a while, but it's kinda tedious.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, automate the boring stuff. Especially if it involves spreadsheets
 MACKEYTH: Any other Nethackers here?
 Astrobytes: long time since I played that but there are bound to be a few, programmers and rogeulikes go hand-in-hand
 Astrobytes: probably find a few people on the discord
 MACKEYTH: I just lost a good run last night to carelessness
 MACKEYTH: Kraken drowning.
 ASM_MOV_INT: they ever consider a dark mode for this website...
 MACKEYTH:&#160;??? What would you make darker?
 Astrobytes: you know you can set the theme using the settings below this chat right ASM_MOV_INT?
 ASM_MOV_INT: chat is great
 ASM_MOV_INT: it's the white screens... it's not a problem i regularly use a partially transparent powershell window for non-dark mode websites like this one
 MACKEYTH: D'oh. I didn't know that was there, Astrobytes
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 ASM_MOV_INT: one great feature they added to windows 10 a while back was, just hovering your mouse over a window, turns the scroll focus on the tab, window or whatever you hover over, thus I don't need to take the focus away from my powershell transparency window to scroll underneath it
 Wontonimo: new puzzle of the week is ascii 
 Wontonimo: hehe, i like it
 Wontonimo: and i've been playing with rasterization and shaders
 MACKEYTH: Ok, step 1 complete. I have a UTTT bot that will play randomly and uses bitboards;
 Wontonimo: woot!
 Wontonimo: MACKEYTH did the win condition check make sense?
 MACKEYTH: Yep. Made a constant array of winning bitboards, then check to see if board &amp; template = template
 Wontonimo: for the 9x9 board I actually store 9 3x3 boards for the small subboards, and 1 3x3 board that stores the overall
 MACKEYTH: Same
 Wontonimo: cool
 MACKEYTH: Great minds, eh?&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: oh wow, my "small" performance improvement yesterday for UTTT moved me from 35th to 30th
 MACKEYTH: What did you change?
 Wontonimo: during expand i used to check every move in 9x9.  i added a test to see if the move is forced and if so then only check the 3x3 forced into
 Wontonimo: seems dumb that i didn't optimize that before.  guess i just forgot about it
 MACKEYTH: Looks like a lot of coders got to bronze and gave up. I'm winning about 50%
 Jayarrowz:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yeah, that happens in multis where the rules change
 Wontonimo: looks like no. 1 in Bronze has a score of ~31 vs your bot ~23
 Wontonimo: 4 points difference is i think 9:1 win/loss, whereas 8 points difference is more like 99:1 or more win/loss
 MACKEYTH: Jeez, how many games does ReCurse have #1 in? The dude is fierce.
 MACKEYTH: Like mutant superpower fierce.
 Wontonimo: he burnt himself out doing it&#160;;(
 MACKEYTH: Aww, he's not active anymore?
 Wontonimo: it would be nice to see him back and loving life, sharing knowledge
 MACKEYTH: ++
 Wontonimo: he had a baby just after SC2021 which was also a culmination of a few  years of NN work he put in at CG to try and get to the top before NN on CG was cool
 Wontonimo: and that was the last multi contest, so actually a lot of people slipped away 
 Wontonimo: sadly, that was my first multi contest and probably last
 Wontonimo: so, what's the next thing in your bot?  
 Wontonimo: can you add MC to your current bot MACKEYTH&#160;?
 MACKEYTH: I'll give it a shot
 Wontonimo: did MC make sense?
 Astrobytes: didn't you have a playground for that Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: no.  just a tech.io snippet
 Astrobytes: ah right
 MACKEYTH: I think so. Like MCTS, except you're just running random playouts from all possible initial moves and counting the wins for each?
 Wontonimo: exactly
 Wontonimo: you can sub random playouts with a probable heuristic playout, but for UTTT random seems to work best.
 Astrobytes: UTTT is notorious for a lack of reliable heuristics
 Wontonimo: ^^ +1
 p.p.o.p.: Hi chat! Question about my code. This is something that I have been running into repeatedly here. I assign initialize a variable without a value, then give it a value somewhere else. This works in Unity (using same language), where I started coding. Here it tells me it hasn't been assigned. It doesn't feel "proper" to assign it some silly value that I know will be changed.
 p.p.o.p.: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a07d4a8-747c-4662-aed7-2f25ea55f448">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9a07d4a8-747c-4662-aed7-2f25ea55f448</a>

 struct: its just a warning
 Astrobytes: and what happens if you accidentally use the value of an uninitialised variable?&#160;:)
 MACKEYTH: That throws an error in Java.
 p.p.o.p.: no but i do initialize it. In the for loop
 p.p.o.p.: which works in unity and is what the book I am reading says to do
 struct: compiler wont know if the surfaceN will be greater or equal to 1
 struct: so safeLandingMinX could be unitialized
 p.p.o.p.: oh i see
 p.p.o.p.: so what is best practice there
 p.p.o.p.:&#160;?
 struct: maybe initialize with 0
 p.p.o.p.: okay. That's what I've been doing but for some reason that felt wrong
 p.p.o.p.: thank you!
 Ceekay77: This made the Embedded C in me twitch lol
 MACKEYTH: MC UTTT bot in the arena
 MACKEYTH: Beat Bronze.&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: nice one MACKEYTH, good luck&#160;:)
 MACKEYTH: I'm only getting a few hundred sims, though. Not good at all.
 Astrobytes: should be getting more for sure
 ionKOT: An integer H, the height reached by the ball after the sixth rebound.
 ionKOT: whats the math guys
 ionKOT: CONSTRAINTS:1 ‚â§ H ‚â§ 10000 
 MACKEYTH: Depends on the elasticity of the ball and the surface
 p.p.o.p.: Seems like if it is an integer it wouldn't be that complex MACEYTH maybe the simulation you are doing has some details?
 MACKEYTH: Thought experiment: beanbag bouncing on pillow vs ball bearing on steel plate. Very important
 ionKOT: lol
 ionKOT: input 5
 ionKOT: ourput 320
 ionKOT: how did it get 320
 p.p.o.p.: haha definitely, but I'm guessing if they are asking for an integer H then it is not trying to match real world physics and is more like: Each bounce the ball loses x amount and you have to calculate the number of bounces for h to get to zero and add up each of those bounces
 ionKOT: clash code a little to advance for me
 MACKEYTH: How in blazes is Wontonimo getting 200k sims? I must be doing something terribly inefficient
 ionKOT: where is the learning side
 Wontonimo: hey MACKEYTH,
 Wontonimo: that was just for 3x3 tic tac toe
 MACKEYTH: Oh, whew. Less panicked now.
 Wontonimo: for UTTT my bot does 90k to 120k
 Wontonimo: it was a HUGE accomplishment when I passed 20k rollouts per turn.  That's the generally agreed level you need to reach to beat the Gold bot
 Wontonimo: how many sims can your bot do in 100ms?
 MACKEYTH: I had to cut it off at 50ms to keep it from timing out.
 Wontonimo: java right?
 MACKEYTH: Yeah
 Wontonimo: don't use the garbage collector
 Wontonimo: so, don't let go of objects
 Wontonimo: you have 700Mb or ram per game.  you don't need to clean up RAM for the next game
 MACKEYTH: IDK how to turn off Java garbage collection, if it can even be done.
 Wontonimo: easy, don't let go of data
 5922: keep an active reference
 Wontonimo: pre-allocate and reuse lots of stuff
 MACKEYTH: I have tried that, and it actually seems to make things worse
 Wontonimo: for example, I have 1 board that is global the I reuse for every rollout.  I don't allocate a new one ever
 MACKEYTH: That's probably a time sink that I could tackle. I'm creating a new map for each possible move
 Wontonimo: a java profiler will really help you identify where time is being used
 Wontonimo: there are two "heuristics" that have been identified for UTTT.  1st - if you are the first to play the play in the very center
 Wontonimo: 2nd - if you are first to play in a miniboard, play such that your opponent has to play in the same board.
 ionKOT: what are these questions mannn
 ionKOT: gott dam
 Mishaaargh: ugh is there a round equiv for c++? ceil didn't work for me and including &lt;cmath&gt; didn't work
 MACKEYTH: math.h, round
 Mishaaargh: thank you i'll try that next time. so frustrating
 MACKEYTH: Remember Google
 Mishaaargh: thanks i tried that 
 Mishaaargh: and it told me to include cmath
 Mishaaargh: in 2022 tellin people to google is pretty pointless

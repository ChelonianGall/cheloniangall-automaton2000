 Almost404: man i really need to learn python3 doing clash in java is heartbreaking
 Enknable: learn Ruby if you want to win clash
 Almost404: i just dont want to smallest code and they have 57 chars and i have 445
 Almost404: might bad tho
 Enknable: almost guaranteed a 30% wr tho.
 Enknable: give or take losing to another Ruby user in golf
 siddharthdeo99: from where i can master basics in python
 jacek: happy Caturday
 eulerscheZahl: hi

 jacek: reCurse i see you fixed your bugs
 jacek: does p2 has advantage still?
 eulerscheZahl: the perfect submit :o
 jacek: used to be me&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: may I remind reCurse that he wanted to stay away from community games (mainly because of the low match count)
 TBali: shall I fight the borrower today, or shall I go swiftly?
 TBali: Life choices...
 Takkashi: moin
 TBali: I like type safety, but Rust takes it to an interstellar level...
 Westicles: Ran out of problems to solve in PHP?
 mzbear: rust is super tedious to write, but perhaps i'm just not fluent enough with it.  however, every time i've ported a piece of my c++ code to rust, the compilation has initially failed because it has exposed crazy buggy corner cases that existed in my c++ code, and i really like that.  i'm just completely unable to prototype anything in rust, i have to write it in c++ first :D
 tekki:&#160;:) mzbear
 Westicles: I judge languages by the quality of their heredoc.  Rust is one of the better ones
 TBali: well, I am not completely against Rust, I see the advantage of being very strict. But for simple puzzles it can be a pain.Example all the different integer types are REALLY different
 TBali: A small example, I encountered now: Don't Panic puzzle
 TBali: vector can be indexed only by usize
 TBali: fine, floor number is typicaly usize.
 TBali: However sometimes input can be -1 so it is read as i32
 TBali: now I have to make a specific edge case - out of 27 languages only 2 neeeded this.
 TBali: But most likely there are several much more elegant solutions in Rust for this particular problem.
 mzbear: the puzzles aren't a very good case for evaluating a language, though, because the puzzles encourage writing code that is allowed to catastrophically fail with incorrect input
 mzbear: if you had to do proper error checking in every language, it would even things out
 TBali: I agree, it was just a firendly banter on my side. Rust brought something new on the language table, and beginner level struggles might pay off on the long run.
 dbdr: first message I see after a while is about Rust&#160;:)
 mzbear: i never got past the beginner level in rust, because it's too tedious to write code in it&#160;:/
 TBali: I raised the bar quite high - convert 30 short puzzle solutions...&#160;:-)
 TBali: (Except Bash and perl)
 dbdr: you get most of the annoyances in doing such puzzles
 dbdr: vs little benefits
 dbdr: so I imagine it can be unappealing
 TBali: Actually, I once gave up after 15, then started to read <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/</a> now things make much more sense
 TBali: but still a beginner
 TBali: put a 4h Rust fundamentals video on Pluralsight on the near todo list&#160;:-)
 dbdr: yeah, the book is highly recommendd
 dbdr: most languages you can learn from practice + google + API
 dbdr: rust has new concepts, if you ignore that you are going to suffer
 TBali: stackoverflow is my friend - except when it is not
 mzbear: this was also "fun" read: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/">https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/</a>
 dbdr: stackoverflow is problem oriented, not concept oriented, most of the time
 TBali: Well, first few puzzles I did without even having heard of the borrower concept... it was like a monkey trying to do Shakespear
 TBali: mzbear - thanks I saw that, but put aside for later. I am at more basic stuff
 TBali: Where does the name come from? I have been to Rust in Austria at Fertő-tó several times...
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr is back \o/
 dbdr: xmas is over&#160;;)
 TBali: maybe by an auto trigger to "Rust"&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: so we can either have you or xmas?
 eulerscheZahl: i choose you
 dbdr: let me imagine rust was a constant topic for the whole of 2021&#160;;)
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl is sweet this year :o
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VKza949FL._AC_.jpg">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VKza949FL._AC_.jpg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: nah, I just don't care about xmas :P
 dbdr: I started a Futurama rewatch&#160;:)
 dbdr: evil Santa and all
 eulerscheZahl: cool, one of my favorite TV shows
 jacek: really?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, great show
 eulerscheZahl: you missed the confirmation that community contests are dead&#160;:(
 dbdr: hum, looks like I got closer to _Royale by not doing anythingmaybe I should continue on that path :D
 eulerscheZahl: i blame royale for being inactive too
 eulerscheZahl: your ideas made me climb at CotR
 eulerscheZahl: you told smits to run a beam search. he passed that on to me
 dbdr: yeah, probably he hasn't done many of the new multis that slowly give more CPs
 eulerscheZahl: or quickly if PotW
 dbdr: aha, cool, didn't remember talking to you about cotr, that xplains it
 dbdr: oh, sub 3k, nice eulerscheZahl
 dbdr: eu&lt;tab&gt; does not work&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: still for 2 or 3 my handcrafted solution is better than my solver
 jacek: use AutomatonNN for that
 AutomatonNN: and what is that link?
 eulerscheZahl: but i found some nice paths with beam search. one with a loop of length &gt; 20
 dbdr: only 2 or 3? :no_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: and I don't support nested loops&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and i could even improve my score if i would copy the replays from the overview page. some of those are better than what I have
 Westicles: why mess with multis when you can delve into the exciting world of Horn-satisfiability?
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like a puzzle from a Cat?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/horn-sat-solver">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/horn-sat-solver</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no, not even from him
 BlaiseEbuth: :metal:
 eulerscheZahl: seems like I did a rage-quit there
 Westicles: Anytime anyone says your contrib is inappropriate for CG, this link should be kept handy 
 dbdr: isn't there a very hard category?
 eulerscheZahl: and 3 of your favorite users approved it
 dbdr: I know JBM was one of them :D
 dbdr: *knew
 eulerscheZahl: he now got his freecell approved. without having a solver on his own
 eulerscheZahl: i tried a bit but it will be hard to solve FreeCell within 1s I think
 BlaiseEbuth: eulerscheZahl -&gt; the approvers identity is precisely why the puzzle is inappropriate :smirk:
 ChampionCoder: Lol I just got my own contribution in a clash! :smile:
 ChampionCoder: Soled it in like 44 seconds
 ChampionCoder: *Solved
 eulerscheZahl: i stopped clashing when I got a contribution that I approved 2h before
 ChampionCoder: Haha
 eulerscheZahl: didn't feel right to me
 ChampionCoder: I like CoC more than other things, but Bot Programming is an close second to it
 Westicles: BlaiseEbuth, nah it just is a very specialized problem you would have to research a bunch or already know the answer.  That's the exact reason people give for rejecting contribs all the time
 eulerscheZahl: I think those unwritten requirements drifted over time
 eulerscheZahl: it was approved 2.5 years ago. we don't know if it would still pass today
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm joking. Don't even know this puzzle.
 eulerscheZahl: I never tried to solve. I know about the theoretical background from lectures
 BlaiseEbuth: What is appropriate for CG is not clearly defined anyway... :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: there are some loose guidelines. It got a little better
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. we now know that close duplicates are allowed for CoC
 BlaiseEbuth: :expressionless:
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't reflect my personal opinion so I stopped moderating those. that simple
 Westicles: Well to be fair, it is difficult to know what is out there already on COC
 eulerscheZahl: getting too many to review them anyways these days
 eulerscheZahl: i often pointed out that we have almost exactly that clash already and linked itcreator: oh, i didn't know. and totally understood that there's no need for a 2nd one
 eulerscheZahl: the main question: where can I see a list of clashes
 BlaiseEbuth: Do you know this tool&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh nice. haven't seen that before
 BlaiseEbuth: :ok_hand:
 ChampionCoder: Somebody should make that official
 eulerscheZahl: I didn't even know that https works :o
 ChampionCoder: Just before submitting, they should search if the puzzle is already in the list
 ChampionCoder: Hey eulerscheZahl, did you create that
 ChampionCoder:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: let's see if Skynet 1 -&gt;  2 is trivial
 ChampionCoder: Oh ok&#160;:+1:
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't you have configured https yourself&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, comes from heroku
 eulerscheZahl: i checked the certificate
 eulerscheZahl: issued to: *.herokuapp.com
 ChampionCoder: Ha Ha, BitWolf did not get how to solve my puzzle :laughing:Which means that another player did not get it
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i can configure it to enforce https
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. I did'nt know heroku. Thought it was just a part of your domain.
 eulerscheZahl: and now the ghost of that player will forever haunt the CG servers
 eulerscheZahl: heroku is free web hosting
 ChampionCoder: Haha yeah&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: with a database and server for your own code
 eulerscheZahl: supports python (django/flask), ruby, php and a few others
 eulerscheZahl: the free database is limited to 10k rows. which is why i removed the codejam search recently
 eulerscheZahl: had an sqlite file. but that's not persistent
 eulerscheZahl: so i switched to postgres (keeps puzzles when I tell the server to update, I don't have to release a new version for that anymore)
 eulerscheZahl: and codejam just was too big
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://help.heroku.com/J2R1S4T8/can-heroku-force-an-application-to-use-ssl-tls">https://help.heroku.com/J2R1S4T8/can-heroku-force-an-application-to-use-ssl-tls</a>oh, the https part is pretty simple&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: I see. I prefer rent a small vps and do my grub on it, too many limitations and problems with classic  hostings...
 eulerscheZahl: i see the advantages of a paid server. e.g. stilgart grawls CG every day at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: i can't do that easily I think
 eulerscheZahl: and after 30min without request the website gets suspended
 eulerscheZahl: giving a 10s delay when it's used again and needs to be restarted
 BlaiseEbuth: erf
 TBali: free lunch arrives with cold soup
 eulerscheZahl: but it's free
 eulerscheZahl: i'm they guy who eats twice or thrice as much as the average colleague when there is free pizza in the office
 eulerscheZahl: updated, forward to HTTPS works
 BlaiseEbuth: The taste of free...
 eulerscheZahl: no, i'm just a good eater in general
 TBali: Well if I had to choose from "free speech" and "free beer" i would go for "free speech" but it is a close call&#160;:-) 
 BlaiseEbuth: :pizza:
 TBali: there is no fee pizza in home office
 TBali: *free
 eulerscheZahl: for beer it's a no brainer for me: speech it is
 TBali: what about "free speech" and "free pizza"&#160;? 
 TBali: fior lifetime
 eulerscheZahl: that's a tough one
 BlaiseEbuth: free beer
 dbdr: euler challenging german stereotypes&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: i also don't like German restaurants. Italian or Chinese are much better
 dbdr: Italian in Italy are even better&#160;:)
 TBali: I like Weisswurst but would not eat it too often 
 TBali: Same with pizza
 dbdr: kid, when I was your age, it was possible to travel to other countries
 eulerscheZahl: :older_man:
 mzbear: servers are ridiculously cheap, though, if you're willing to manage one yourself
 TBali: When I was very kid it was NOT possible
 TBali: only to DDR
 eulerscheZahl: i'm lazy and heroku works fine for me
 mzbear: i have some servers from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud">https://www.hetzner.com/cloud</a> ... 3e/month is pretty good value for a simple linux box
 Westicles: Everyone have their French smurf ready for the big contest?
 mzbear: there have also occasionally been really good discounts at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lowendbox.com/">https://lowendbox.com/</a>
 dbdr: damn, I managed to break even the testcases that worked :D
 eulerscheZahl: does that include a domain or do you need that extra?
 TBali: I think I pay 25€ per year for my site
 BlaiseEbuth: I am my French smurf
 mzbear: no domain at those prices, although i think hezner's web hosting at 2e/month did include one... let me check
 TBali: For the contest - if statement is in French then I am doomed
 eulerscheZahl: just curious, atm I have to reason to leave heroku
 BlaiseEbuth: Use a translator
 eulerscheZahl: i've particiapted in a contest where everything was in Russian. statement, whole website
 eulerscheZahl: i got along pretty well with translators
 mzbear: 10 setup fee, then 2e/month .. for managed web hosting at hetzner, including a domain registration. but they provide no cron jobs for that
 eulerscheZahl: 1 or 2 things that I didn't fully understand. but we have a Russian chat here to ask
 TBali: The site I am using since 2011 has only Hungarian website&#160;:-)
 mzbear: hosting a website has gotten ridiculously cheap lately
 eulerscheZahl: yeah. even if you want more than just the wordpress
 TBali: I have cPanel, 5GB, php, mysql, etc... no php 8 yet though
 eulerscheZahl: you and your love for PHP
 TBali: actually it is a love and hate reationship
 TBali: Internally I am a more "strict type" soul
 TBali: but php is getting better in this respect
 TBali: I learned php for my hobby site. And cheap hosting does not allow Java or  C# backend
 TBali: Python was out of view that time for me
 eulerscheZahl: i'M pretty sure heroku offers Java
 mzbear: i'm running a minecraft server on a 8e/month linux box with 4G RAM and 80G ssd disk, 3 virtual cores from AMD epyc 2.5GHz, but even the 3e box ran it surprisingly well.  it's amazing how cheap it is
 Westicles: Minecraft?  Is that like fortnite?
 TBali: minecraft server...  thumbsup
 eulerscheZahl: Node.js, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, Clojure
 TBali: Westicles thubmsdown&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: that's what heroku supports
 eulerscheZahl: have fun with Clojure
 TBali: My solo puzzle conversion project is enough fun for Clojure
 TBali: had to buy new ( keys
 TBali: And LISP was a #3 or #4 language in some point of time...
 Westicles: LISP was the only language taught when I was an undergrad
 TBali: Not even Pascal?
 Westicles: nope
 TBali: In my undergrad years we had ML, Prolog,  Modula2
 eulerscheZahl: Pascal was my first language
 eulerscheZahl: with an IDE older than myself
 TBali: C64 BASIC for me 
 dbdr: TP IDE was way ahead of its time though
 eulerscheZahl: it didn't support a mouse
 TBali: Absolutely. It was sci fi
 TBali: TP supported mouse but who would use that
 TBali: I knew all keyboard shortcuts
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm just too young to appreciate those tools
 dbdr: get off my lawn and go learn vi&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: not even vim?
 TBali: Well it evolved. Currwnt static analysis and linting is amazing
 TBali: All info is at fingertip
 dbdr: in truth I use nvim, i'm a sucker for modernity :D
 TBali: neovim -  yeah quite modern stuff
 mzbear: Westicles, minecraft has a kind of in-world programmable circuit game mechanic, btw.  You can do some quite wonderful things with it, not your average first person game
 mzbear: so, not like fortnite&#160;:)
 TBali: There were some talks about education edition. Did it come out?
 TBali: I did not follow in past 2-3 years
 mzbear: education edition has been out for some years, yeah, but i haven't tried it
 Westicles: wow, surprised so many Microsoft fans here...
 TBali: My son showed me what he did with redstone - pretty amazing, logic circuits, yeah
 TBali: Mojang fan, not?
 mzbear: microsoft bought minecraft quite a while ago, and although they've been hands off mostly, it's kinda changing slowly
 mzbear: this year, they'll migrate all minecraft accounts into MSN accounts, for example, and i have some mixed feelings about that
 TBali: Just checking <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://education.minecraft.net/">https://education.minecraft.net/</a>It says "start coding" ... just like CG
 TBali: Well, paid some really big bucks for it, afaik,
 mzbear: 2.5 billion dollars.  it's quite amazing how it happened, too
 eulerscheZahl: MS bought github too&#160;:(
 mzbear: Notch was frustrated about the whole EULA situation and tweeted jokingly a question if anyone wants to buy his share of mojang, and microsoft called and made that offer
 TBali: LOL
 BLU2403: Factorio is a really game for getting into automation, logic circuits, resource management, etc.
 mzbear: it was regarding to whether third party servers were allowed to sell loot boxes, which minecraft EULA had forbidden them to do, and there was massive drama about it which drove Notch crazy
 TBali: Factorio - will check, thx
 BLU2403: You're welcome
 dbdr: factorio is addictive!
 mzbear: oh boy, factorio is another great game for a programmer.  i think i have spent a total of 1000 hours in it, i have no idea how much time i wasted before it got on Steam
 BLU2403: Some people have gone as far as creating 3D graphics using logic circuits in Factorio, among other borderline insane things
 BLU2403: LOL
 mzbear: well, the programmable lights were really begging for it :P
 TBali: 1000 hours.... Then maybe I shouldn't check...&#160;:-)
 TBali: Knowing myself
 mzbear: TBali lol
 BLU2403: Especially when you get into the modding community
 BlaiseEbuth: I quitted the game when ms bought it. github is the last ms thing I use, and I don't know until when...
 BLU2403: Then you can program just about anything 
 BLU2403: fCPU is a pretty cool mod on Factorio for learning Assembly Language, it's also helpful for simplifying combinator circuits
 TBali: I had quite anti-MS sentiment earlier, but now I don't see that much difference between companies
 mzbear: I took a 5 year break from minecraft after MS bought it, but somehow i ended up getting back
 Westicles: wow, 1000 hours.  that's like 3% of your awake adult life
 BLU2403: Yep, that's Factorio :grin:
 TBali: Guys, I told you a MILLION times not to exaggarate
 organtrail: 1000 hours is 3 percent&#160;:( ) 
 organtrail: oh no
 dbdr: depends how long you live...
 TBali: OR SLEEP
 TBali: sorry capslock, not  shouting
 BLU2403: Just checked my Steam account: I've clocked 776.8 hours so far.
 organtrail: ohh no i have multiple steam accounts&#160;:(
 BLU2403: But who cares about circadian rythm anyway
 organtrail: multiple games with 1k+ hours&#160;:(
 TBali: I would be interested in my CG counter status...
 TBali: Or not
 BLU2403: ^ For Factorio
 eulerscheZahl: I still use some MS stuff. Like VS Code or the .net framework
 Stilgart: dbdr is back \o/
 eulerscheZahl: it's just their OS that I don't like
 eulerscheZahl: 5%er problems :P
 BlaiseEbuth: Hate both... ^^
 TBali: Every second Windows is fine
 TBali: but let's not start a flame war, I am not interested in that 
 eulerscheZahl: you can't configure Windows to use it as efficiently as I am with i3
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: chadok.info is quite light in requests actually
 mzbear: Windows 2000 was kinda nice. Afterwards it started going downhill
 organtrail: does anybody feel like games in the last 10 years have graphics but less playable&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but you have it running 24h/dayand with a cron job
 BLU2403: There's also MineTest if you want an opensource alternative to MineCraft. The Mesecons and Pipeworks mods can be installed to get something similar to the redstone in MineCraft
 organtrail: while games from early 2k were more playable , but worse graphics&#160;?
 TBali: 1000 api calls per days no? plus 10 for leaderboard?
 eulerscheZahl: + the list of puzzles with upvote stats
 eulerscheZahl: and solver count
 TBali: organtail - I don't think it cen be generalized
 mzbear: organtrail: games these days are indeed about content, not about game mechanics&#160;:/
 TBali: I thoight onky about the xp leaderboard
 BlaiseEbuth: If you look only at the AAA...
 Stilgart: 1 per puzzle + 1 per category (to find if there is a new puzzle) + 15 calls to the leaderboard API + around 50 calls for extra players
 Stilgart: one webpage calls ~10 API
 TBali: which api lists all puzzle ids?
 mzbear: smaller developers still explore game mechanics.  all the Zachtronics games are quite nice, for example
 TBali: I think I did not find a proper one for that
 organtrail: i mean ya but how can you not only look at AAA&#160;? indie games kinda like ur sibling trying something first time and ofc u gonna give some extra points
 Stilgart: I use findProgressByIds
 Stilgart: the one from the practice page I presume
 eulerscheZahl: findAllMinimalProgress gives a list
 mzbear: TIS-100 was kinda amazing game, for example
 Stilgart: I have not so much memories of TIS-100
 TBali: Puzzle/findProgressByIds&#160;?but then you need the id of the puzzle already, no?
 Stilgart: but it was good enough to make buy space chem :drooling_face:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/services/Puzzle/findAllMinimalProgress">https://www.codingame.com/services/Puzzle/findAllMinimalProgress</a>
 eulerscheZahl: with a payload of [null]
 eulerscheZahl: gives a list of about 500 puzzles
 organtrail: are there any android devs in here&#160;?
 Stilgart: let me check
 TBali: I use Puzzle_findAllMinimalProgress but it is not full list
 TBali: Maybe I remeber it wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i just inspected now, never tried
 TBali: it was several months ago I checked that 
 TBali: it requres authentication
 mzbear: I loved that TIS-100 actually had a reference manual that you had to read. I suppose there's something wrong with my brain :D
 organtrail: hmm im about to push my first android game using unity... in app purchases and google cloud save... im starting to get worried about TOS and retaining rights to muh art which will be shipped with the game instead of downloaded on gameload... anybody have tips or links&#160;?
 TBali: so I think those you did not solve is excluded - but mybe I am wrong
 Stilgart: I indeed also use Puzzle/findAllMinimalProgress
 BLU2403: Shenzhen-I/O is another assembly game from Zachtronics like TIS-100. Pretty interesting Embedded Electronics angle 
 Stilgart: are you telling me that this one has changed&#160;?
 BLU2403: for the gameplay
 Stilgart: BLU2403: Shenzhen IO /o\
 Stilgart: this one was really hard&#160;:)
 BLU2403: :grinning:
 Westicles: Work all day, go home and play games exactly like work
 BLU2403: Yeah, the signal processing puzzles were something else
 TBali: Stilgart - no most likely my mistake. It gives indeed a long list
 BlaiseEbuth: Nobody said he works all day.. :3
 TBali: Have to check if  the untouched puzzles are there or not
 Stilgart: I have freecell in my list
 TBali: But for you it is the same&#160;:-)
 Stilgart: so yes there are :D
 Stilgart: they*
 eulerscheZahl: i use an incognito tab to inspect those
 eulerscheZahl: not logged in, list of 525 puzzles
 TBali: OK, my bad. Thanks for the help
 eulerscheZahl: my herokuapp has 436. but there are some official puzzles that I don't index
 TBali: Still missing the XP leaderboard API

 Stilgart: at some point, make 1 call per player on top 1000 would be better
 Westicles: Should be 475 I think
 TBali: euler - No, I meant what Stikgart did for top1k 
 TBali: low cp users are missing from xp leadeboard
 eulerscheZahl: he has a way to manually add users. and check their individual profiles
 Stilgart: I have added them manually 
 Stilgart: (well, I have a list + I can call the correct script via ssh)
 Stilgart: CodinGamer/findCodingamePointsStatsByHandle
 Stilgart: with "[$handle]"
 eulerscheZahl: too bad the XP events are private

 TBali: Stilgart shall I send, or you have it (sure you can get, just fo convenience)
 Stilgart: TBali: I only have a very old one
 Stilgart: last time I did this was before OoC
 TBali: I did it on dec 30 for the language toplist, send you in private
 Stilgart: [CG]all: I want an achievement for "500 puzzles in a language" :p
 TBali: 26 to go&#160;:-)
 TBali: then we need to approve some more contribs for you
 TBali: too bad, general quality is not too high
 BlaiseEbuth: [CG]all: I want the "Contest creator" achievment in compensation, for I'll never get it otherwise.
 Westicles: Tatami tilings looks okay, even if there are already a million tiling puzzles
 TBali: I want a "most xp gain / most new sols" per month leaderboard
 TBali: absolute value is fine, but that would make it more lively
 Westicles:&#160;:)
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: crate something, like a turtle for instance
 Automaton2000: i think i just added
 Stilgart: a /ignore feature would be nice too
 Stilgart: for the webchat

 Westicles: So many graph puzzles on here.  Do you CS types actually use that kind of thing much at work?
 jacek: i dont know if i ever used graph (explicitly) at work
 jacek: but i use them in games
 eulerscheZahl: they make good boards to walk on
 eulerscheZahl: grid-based game =&gt; graph
 jacek: and there is some :soccer: game that uses graphs
 Westicles: Hmmm, well there are like 75 puzzles on graphs.  Maybe time to have a moratorium on new ones 
 jrke: i added few images in resources in multi in my local computer but when i am running its showing its not there i also cleared temp files then also same error?why
 Oliversss: answer me Sam!!!

 jrke: re importing project worked thanks
 D3adshotX25: hellp wporls
 eulerscheZahl: you must be using eclipse :P
 jacek: eclipse... i felt so nostalgic
 Almost404: ew eclipse
 jrke: yup eclipse
 TomiiPomii: use JavaEditor like a Chad
 jacek: kree java!
 eulerscheZahl: BlueJ
 _Lelouch_: PHP sucks
 jacek: i bet you didnt write vacuum cleaner in PHP
 codernikhil: C++ is best for competitive programming
 codernikhil: but language doesn't make much difference you should be good in problem solving.
 trictrac: eulerscheZahl&#160;: do you have a bot for TryAngle Catch&#160;? I am alone :slight_smile:
 jacek: what league
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, in which league shall I submit?
 eulerscheZahl: my bot is pretty basic&#160;:(
 trictrac: the first one
 eulerscheZahl: then I have to remove some commands
 trictrac: OK i can push in all the league, you can choose
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: you can only submit in 1 league
 jacek: but only one can be active at time
 eulerscheZahl: i submitted in the lower now
 trictrac: I know but my bot can be pushed in the 4 leagues. So I will go where someone is
 eulerscheZahl: lowest for now
 trictrac: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: and it's 4-3 in your favor already :D
 trictrac: Not significant for sure&#160;!
 jacek: like 5% significatnt
 eulerscheZahl: at least I can consistently beat jacek :P
 eulerscheZahl: but you don't do more than random, do you?
 jacek: i found some random code in C#, trying nw
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 eulerscheZahl: suddenly it looked quite familiar
 eulerscheZahl: the movements
 eulerscheZahl: your python on the other side was random I suppose
 jacek: yes
 jacek: i need to use german proxy to access talkchess&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: works fine without proxy for me
 jacek: no wai
 geppoz: puzzle of the week quite hard this time...
 geppoz: last test timeouts like hell :D
 ChampionCoder: I agre
 ChampionCoder: e
 ChampionCoder: The week before the last was too easy
 ChampionCoder: All test cases passed, but it was optimization, so the points counted, not the number of correct test cases
 geppoz: :thinking:

 eulerscheZahl: $4 and 100 cents
 DaMonkey: 1.64$
 eulerscheZahl: i know what you did with that number :D
 jacek:&#160;:?:
 eulerscheZahl: 1.64% of the CG community are classified as competitive
 jacek: where does that come from
 eulerscheZahl: lengthy discord discussion
 jacek: oh
 BlaiseEbuth: But that's not a real answer... Where does that REALLY come from&#160;?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06f49052-26f3-4b3d-ab42-fca456c6b218">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06f49052-26f3-4b3d-ab42-fca456c6b218</a>
 eulerscheZahl: CG poll with 160k participants
 eulerscheZahl: was on your main page at some point
 struct: From those 3 options
 eulerscheZahl: struct won, my internet was laggy
 struct: I would always vote the learn first
 eulerscheZahl: i think i voted fun
 struct: or that one
 eulerscheZahl: because for me competing is fun
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: but only a subset of the fun
 eulerscheZahl: if they want to get our opinion about contest frequency, then they should ask for that and not try to extrapolate
 eulerscheZahl: but i guess they don't really want to know&#160;:(
 Uljahn: i didn't participate in the poll because im not a developer&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: not that poll
 Uljahn: ah
 eulerscheZahl: there was one shown at your main page. just a single question
 eulerscheZahl: and 1 answer to choose
 geppoz: recently I tried leetcode
 BlaiseEbuth: I know that. I was there. I meant that throw numbers and affirm what they are supposed to mean is pretty easy without source sharing.
 eulerscheZahl: leetcode has their contests around 3am, not an option for me
 geppoz: they transformed every puzzle in a contest by giving scores in CPU times and memory use
 eulerscheZahl: long ago there was a site named codeeval
 eulerscheZahl: they gave you points for solving a problem. but reduced it for extra time and memory consumption so you could impossibly get the max score
 eulerscheZahl: they are no longer in business
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even miss them
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway, is this poll method relevant&#160;? I know that a lot of regular users (including me) never (or nearly) go on the Home page. And all the users who come only in contest period have probably not seen that poll either...
 eulerscheZahl: it's relevant in a way that CG plans their next steps baseds on it
 eulerscheZahl: is the poll representative? that's the actual question
 eulerscheZahl: if you have 166k participants, lots of them probably visit the site once or twice and never come back
 eulerscheZahl: don't even know about bot programming or contests
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes, but quantity is important, right&#160;? :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even know if every user got to see the poll. or just with registration &gt; 1 month or whatever
 eulerscheZahl: sampling matters
 jacek: there should be some ranking threshold for the pool
 jacek: poll even
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm in rage again, thank you
 jacek: relax, its caturday
 eulerscheZahl: and tomorrow is funday
 eulerscheZahl: as we are all here for fun
 zhoubou: And day after that is meanday
 Illedan: Why rage?
 BlaiseEbuth: You're welcome. I care about maintain the flame.
 eulerscheZahl: and after meanday finally toadsday
 zhoubou: Haha :D
 reCurse: Just let it go
 eulerscheZahl: i miss the old days
 jacek: like fryday?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not even about my game
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder has more contests. sadly optims and no bot programming but can be fun too
 BlaiseEbuth: reCurse, we're waiting for your self made platform.
 reCurse: Where's that meme with the skeleton waiting
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, leaving the sinking ship before it flies into the mountain
 reCurse: To be fair nothing changed except our hopes
 reCurse: Site remains the same for the time being
 eulerscheZahl: know we have official confirmation for what we observed already
 reCurse: Sure. But in practice nothing changes yet.
 reCurse: Still have the 2 contests a year, still have the multis, still have us.
 reCurse: Sure we had hopes for something we'd like more that got dashed
 reCurse: But let's not throw out the baby with the bath water
 BlaiseEbuth: Keep the water
 Illedan: haha
 Westicles: They'll figure something out.  Like one button that signs up for all contests for a year
 darkhorse64: CG also says they have a project to have smaller scale contests centered around optims, multis
 darkhorse64: They want the site the site to be more lively between contests. 
 eulerscheZahl: that reads like a sentence authored by AutomatonNN :P
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a lot of contests for that in the college in the discord
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 BlaiseEbuth: :D
 zhoubou: :rofl:
 darkhorse64: At least he agrees with me
 darkhorse64: To my mind, the poll is misleading.
 reCurse: It doesn't really matter whether we agree with their methods.
 darkhorse64: Sad but true
 reCurse: At least there was transparency
 Illedan: ^
 eulerscheZahl: :point_up:
 jacek: reCurse 2p still has advantage?
 reCurse: No, I misread the statement lol
 reCurse: Thought you could capture forward
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: w00t?
 Illedan: lol
 reCurse: That apparently results in a massive p2 advantage easily explained by zugzwang
 reCurse: Well, easily explained when you watch the games anyway
 darkhorse64: and .... restart training
 eulerscheZahl: sorry to say but that's a ceg-style mistake
 jrke: did you mean cegprakash-style?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 reCurse: You never make those?
 eulerscheZahl: of course i do
 reCurse: :P
 jacek: like in onitama. i was confued how cards work for 2nd player
 jrke: everyone makes those mistakes but ceg tells his mistake in public
 eulerscheZahl: they confused me too when writing the engine
 reCurse: So me telling my mistake in public makes me ceg?
 jacek: cegnn
 Illedan: If you ask about it tomorrow it does
 reCurse:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: boy or girl?
 Illedan: I mean ceg would keep asking :P I guess you just fixed it..
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm totally confused, lets start again
 eulerscheZahl: hi Illedan

 darkhorse64: all that is good is french
 jrke: who is the president of US AutomationNN
 zhoubou: AutomatonNN even
 eulerscheZahl: let's talk about tab completion
 AutomatonNN: if you want to be the best reading in the project in the referee and it makes it hot to take this on
 jrke: who is the president of US AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: feels like a better word
 zhoubou: AutomatonNN The president of USA is
 AutomatonNN: if everyone is just a new avatar
 reCurse: No spam please
 zhoubou: Oops, sorry
 zhoubou: Just thought the NN might have a good answer for that one

 eulerscheZahl: i have the illusion too
 jrke: did you mean black dots on yellow circles&#160;?
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: How did it get shipped like that
 eulerscheZahl: it's a feature

 eulerscheZahl: lines*
 Illedan: nope

 Illedan: Just accepted I had 200 rounds of input
 eulerscheZahl: was easier for me to animate that way

 Astrobytes: oh you've returned dbdr!
 dbdr: \o Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: We were wondering where you were, nice to see you back
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan i drop it on purpose. easier to show you what went wrong than just "fix it" especially if it's just a bit outside

 eulerscheZahl: why struct?
 Illedan: Did you ever play tetris struct?
 struct: ah right
 struct: I thought it was like stc
 dbdr: Astrobytes: thanks! I tool a long winter holidays break&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the main open question: do you want the next tile as input too?

 eulerscheZahl: the original game does not give it and I have a solution that works with current tile only
 eulerscheZahl: but to rely a little less on heuristics it would surely help
 Illedan: Easier without the next one :P
 Illedan: Else you would have to search double
 eulerscheZahl: squared
 Illedan: mhm
 eulerscheZahl: i've tried that evil tetris
 eulerscheZahl: not sure anymore if i got a single line :D
 eulerscheZahl: also struct did you change the colors in that screenshot already?
 struct: yes I removed some stuff
 eulerscheZahl: you dared to read my mess?
 Illedan: I want a smaller Tetris testcase as the first one I think
 struct: yeah, now I was trying to fix the invisble sides
 struct: that sometimes happen when moving camera
 Illedan: I have a bug and only the tetris one is easy to debug easy enough
 eulerscheZahl: smaller tetris?
 eulerscheZahl: smaller board?
 Illedan: Yeah for a testcase only
 Illedan: to debug with printing
 eulerscheZahl: hmm, how to add this properly?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want a testcase that's harder than the validators
 eulerscheZahl: and a smaller board will be harder
 Illedan: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: apropos Tetris: Jonas Neubauer died&#160;:(
 jacek: evil 2048 - can tiles spawn so badly that perfect player wont achieve 2048?
 eulerscheZahl: someone even suggested a 2048 multiplayer game

 Illedan: Will finish later. Now pizza time
 Illedan: bye
 eulerscheZahl: oh nice
 jacek: pizza. a circle, divided into triangles, comes in a square
 Knee-Gears: hey euler
 eulerscheZahl: hi Knee-Gears
 TBali: tetris  next item visibility - just a crazy idea: at each turn in output you can 'ask' for next item visibility (if you opted in, it will come as part of next turn input )but it costs you somescore deduction...
 TBali: so you only opt in if you are in trouble
 TBali: ... not sure if that can work, just an idea
 struct: ok, I give up, I tried depthTest: false
 struct: it fixes, it but also creates another bug
 eulerscheZahl: tbali it's a puzzle, not an optim
 eulerscheZahl: no score, just green or red
 eulerscheZahl: and an optional preview would make it more complicated with questionable gain IMO
 reCurse: 3d is hard
 eulerscheZahl: i even fail to place and rotate the camera how I want to
 struct: use axis helper euler
 struct: axeshelper*
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, google corrected that typo already
 eulerscheZahl: but definitely not today anymore
 eulerscheZahl: past 8pm already
 Astrobytes: Telling a German to use the 'axis helper' eh struct :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: sorry :D
 eulerscheZahl: that would have helped but the advice is 80 years too late

 MSmits: I have a weird bug
 MSmits: my bot crashes when i access the 800th character in a string which is 1300 or so chars long
 MSmits: when i turn optimizations off, it doesnt crash
 MSmits: gotta love this weird c++ :poop:
 Revoxs: javaftw
 reCurse: Gonna bet it's your weird c++
 MSmits: likely
 reCurse: It's a shame d&amp;b games are played until the end
 MSmits: when would you suggest they end?
 reCurse: As soon as you get 25 points
 MSmits: ahh yeah I guess thats better. That's always going to be like 70-80% in though
 MSmits: (almost always)
 MSmits: you do save some calctime that way
 MSmits: though... a good bot will stop calculating once it is solved, which it should be halfway through the game
 reCurse: Hmm now that I think about it...
 reCurse: I'm dumb
 reCurse: I can just play random moves when 25 points is reached
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: are you doing a serious try at D&amp;B? And is this a NN?
 reCurse: Just curious how well it works with a direct port
 MSmits: This is a pretty weird game. I'm sure you can use a NN for some parts of it, but it requires some mathy stuff from ply 40 and up. Even if that part can be done by NN, it seems to me that's very wasteful
 MSmits: akin to using a NN to simulate XOR operation
 reCurse: Depends on your perspective
 reCurse: What if I don't need to do the mathy stuff?
 MSmits: it seems to me that the more you use the NN to replace functions of your bot, the more complex your NN is
 kovi: wow, recurse owned bt
 reCurse: :innocent:
 kovi: nn's are scary
 MSmits: grats reCurse
 reCurse: At this point I can easily deploy it to any board game I think
 kovi: i will only play complex heuristic games so far
 kovi: from now on i mean
 MSmits: reCurse is the way you do a NN similar to alpha zero, like the way Robo does it? Or is your way different and maybe more effective within CG limits?
 reCurse: :zipper_mouth:
 MSmits: well I'm not asking for detals :P
 VizGhar: How exactly you should use NN? Haven't done one before. You create NN, train it offline, and use trained values?
 MSmits: details
 VizGhar: I'm quite dumb with it
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thats what right VizGhar
 MSmits: -what
 reCurse: For all I know maybe I can use my framework for spring contest

 MSmits: check with Thibault if they will let you. Not sure how much the "code has to be readable" rule conflicts with this
 MSmits: probably np
 reCurse: shrug
 VizGhar: I need to build one from ground up... hate that abstractions looking at the python's tensorflow
 kovi: (no that it make any difference, as i was not involved in mcts/opening finetunes either)
 MSmits: kovi, many complex games can still be searched
 MSmits: like xmas rush... pretty complex, but you can still write a search
 Astrobytes: Nice uh, 'breakthrough' in Breakthrough reCurse. That was bloody quick!
 reCurse: Yeah I wasted more time with my bugs than actual training lol
 Astrobytes: You gonna try all the board games  with it now?
 reCurse: Maybe
 reCurse: Trying d&amp;b
 Astrobytes: Interesting choice
 reCurse: Had to restart since I realized I don't need to play past 25 points
 MSmits: Remi said on his twitter, or maybe it was facebook, that NN's don't work there. Seems a strong statement, but it's probably a huge challenge
 Astrobytes: Well, they said that about the Unspeakable Tic Tac Toe game
 reCurse: If not I'll move on lol
 reCurse: No I said that
 reCurse: I was wrong
 Astrobytes: Sure someone else did too
 MSmits: yeah, its not at all clear why nn's wouldnt work in uttt. I see no reason
 Astrobytes: Perhaps I'm mistaken
 reCurse: They do work
 MSmits: i know
 reCurse: It's #1 if you don't take into account cg's stupid ranking system
 MSmits: but i never doubted it could, i just wasnt sure about the codesize limit
 struct: How well will it do in yavalath?
 reCurse: Random games fuzzes the top just like csb
 struct: Will it face same problems as robo?
 MSmits: struct it will be fine in yavalath, but it's not gonna beat a book
 struct: ah I see
 struct: So same problem
 reCurse: I'd rather test the book theory with othello tbh
 reCurse: Easier to implement too
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: You need something different for Y right, you need to use a hexagonal cnn iir Robo correctly
 MSmits: if it doesnt take too much time, you should try
 reCurse: Othello is super easy
 MSmits: but you'll just play 10 draws per submit vs me
 reCurse: Hex sucks
 reCurse: Can always do a honor pledge and remove books :P
 MSmits: if i remove book i'm 5th or so in othello
 MSmits: there are stronger bots 
 MSmits: dbdr alone, plays nearly perfeclt
 MSmits: he had a few lines of play that were uncounterable, i can only draw them
 MSmits: it will be fun to see if you can just beat everyone without needing a book, thats cool also
 reCurse: What would be so special about d&amp;b anyway?
 MSmits: well the game completely changes character halfway through
 MSmits: it becomes a graph basically
 MSmits: of chains and loops
 MSmits: and you can solve this with a bunch of mathematical rules
 Astrobytes: Thinking about it, that may not be an issue NN-wise
 MSmits: it doesnt have to be, no
 MSmits: but if you make the game simpler, it will be easier to train
 Astrobytes: Definitely interested to see the results
 MSmits: one way to make it simpler is to take that part out of the equation
 MSmits: if you dont, you got a game with a huge amount of branching
 AI_says_hi: which game is d&amp;b? :nerd:
 MSmits: dots and boxes
 AI_says_hi: oh thanks
 reCurse: So you mean have that solver part of the search?
 MSmits: there are basically 3 phases
 MSmits: from ply 55-60 there is a point where there are no more safe places to put lines
 MSmits: this is phase III
 MSmits: you can solve this
 MSmits: my solver does this almost always within 1 ms
 MSmits: before this you have 20 plies or so in which you can do some fancy stuff with nimstring calculus
 MSmits: to try and gain control
 MSmits: math helps here, maybe NN can take care of this
 MSmits: the first 35-40 plies are a complete mystery to every bot on the leaderboard currently
 MSmits: my bot just plays randomly
 reCurse: How hard is it to code phase 2 and 3 legit?
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure it will eliminate the need for the nimstring analysis - but not 100% sure how well it will do
 MSmits: personally, I found it the hardest I have ever coded for CG =/ But i may have went overboard with phase 3
 MSmits: gone
 MSmits: i'm the only one with an exact score calculator for it
 MSmits: doubt thats necessary
 reCurse: Intriguing
 Astrobytes: (I have no D&amp;B bot, I just read a bunch of papers and listened to Smits Sermons)
 MSmits: the first part of the game, the random part is mostly random because both players use the same lines basically
 MSmits: there are no p1 lines and p2 lines
 MSmits: other board games have two different colors usually
 Astrobytes: Miklla's conversation was interesting
 MSmits: so the only variable with a given gamestate is whose turn it is
 reCurse: Indeed, that was easy though
 reCurse: It seems to me to be extremely pattern intensive
 reCurse: I'm expecting to wipe it off so in reality I'll probably fail miserably
 MSmits: yes, but how do you manipulate a board so that you will be able to benefit at the end if you dont know whose turn it is going to be when the chains and loops are going to be filled in
 MSmits: basically your NN needs to manipulate the board to make sure its not your turn to open a chain at the end
 MSmits: that the main characteristic of a nim game, whose turn it is at the end, loses
 MSmits: (the end meaning, the start of the endgame)
 MSmits: it just seems hard for a NN. But as long as it's better than random, it's a win&#160;:)
 reCurse: Training is slow though...
 reCurse: Long games
 MSmits: oh you're currently training one?
 reCurse: Yeah
 MSmits: you already made sure the sim is correct and all that?
 reCurse: Umm
 reCurse: Maybe? :P
 Astrobytes: Is it worth breaking it down into stages?
 reCurse: I almost enjoy the failure stories
 reCurse: So I'm asking for it
 reCurse: I read the code multiple times and tried a random game a few times
 MSmits: I'm pretty sure it would be good to at least put some restrictions to your NN. Remove moves that are mathematically provably bad
 MSmits: but that would require diving into the literature. Not sure if you like that
 reCurse: Part of the experiment is how much effort you need
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: And no I don't expect to enjoy d&amp;b to go with theory
 reCurse: Breakthrough is fun though
 MSmits: I didn't either at first, but I got into it
 MSmits: I wish breakthrough had more theory
 MSmits: then I wouldn't fail so much at writing an eval
 MSmits: it's annoying when you like a game a lot and then suck at it :P
 MSmits: reCurse do you think that if NN's become the norm, people will distinguish themselves by better combining the NN with domain specific knowledge?
 MSmits: for example, your oware bot would be stronger if you had a generated endgame book 
 MSmits: mine generates a 9 seed book in 500 ms
 reCurse: I think domain specific is inevitable until we get stupid amounts of compute
 MSmits: then you could train the bot to specialize in the 48-10 seed domain and ignore anything after 10
 reCurse: Sure, makes sense
 MSmits: If it were just NN and nothing else, it would make me sad. There has to be more to it than that
 reCurse: I've gotten to the point where I'm much more interested in the generalizable stuff though
 reCurse: I don't have the lofty goals of applying it to complex real-life stuff, I just have weird hobbies
 MSmits: we all do
 reCurse: Is there a no-brainer bot to skip the wood 2
 MSmits: lol... I actually solved wood 2. Then I didnt even promote
 reCurse: Nice
 Illedan: No, you can't 100&#160;% win wood 2. Wood 2 sucks
 MSmits: because my bot knew it would always lose as p1
 AlgoRhythmus: which challenge r u at?
 reCurse: So... what then lol
 MSmits: sensible heuristic &gt; solved game
 MSmits: do it like this
 MSmits: take a box if you can
 MSmits: avoid placing 3 lines on the same box
 MSmits: this might be enough
 reCurse: Hmm
 MSmits: those two rules
 Illedan: Yeah, should be enough
 MSmits: Heiwu we're talking about different multiplayer arena's
 MSmits: Dots and boxes and other games on and off
 reCurse: Is there a P1 advantage?
 AlgoRhythmus: ah, ok
 MSmits: for wood 2 it's either solved 1-3 or 3-1 i forget
 reCurse: For the real thing
 MSmits: it's probabyl solved +2 or -2 so yeah one side will have advantage, but considering every bot plays random for 40 plies, it's negligible
 MSmits: +1 or -1 i should say
 reCurse: So in practice, your experience says it doesn't matter?
 MSmits: it should not
 reCurse: Ok thanks
 MSmits: but there's a bunch of deterministic bots on the leaderboard, who knows what that will do
 Illedan: Depends on how good you are at making those Areas in your own favor, as the research articles are stating
 MSmits: one placed line can turn everything around though Illedan. It's possible to steer the game in your favor in the last 10-20 plies before the endgame, but in the 30 before that it's impossible to tell
 MSmits: miklla is better because he is able to manipulate just  a few turns before my bot 
 MSmits: making sure he has control
 MSmits: but his bot plays the lowest index move for 38 plies
 MSmits: which is pretty much like random
 MSmits: except it's random where everyone knows what you're doing :P
 reCurse: I wonder if you can make those first moves so decisive the rest won't even matter
 MSmits: the game is not really like that. I mean sure, if you had it solved, every ply would have these decisive moves, but patterns just dont really emerge in the early game
 MSmits: say you had a bunch of chains that filled 3 quarters of the field. Just 1 line on the quarter thats left, will completely turn the game around
 MSmits: if you compare it to chess, there are plenty of ways to look at the board and judge the strength of either players' position
 MSmits: but in D&amp;B there is no player position. There is just the board and whomevers turn it is. 
 MSmits: brb
 reCurse: Hmm
 MSmits: what you could do is let your NN give 2 possible outputs
 MSmits: either the one whose turn it is has control at the endgame
 MSmits: or that person does not
 MSmits: having control almost always means you win
 MSmits: even if not, you can voluntarily give away control at any time
 reCurse: Not well versed in terminology
 reCurse: Having control?
 MSmits: if you watch a typical game, you see  players being forced to open a chain at some point
 MSmits: giving away boxes
 MSmits: the player that is forced to open a chain does *not* have control
 MSmits: which is bad
 MSmits: basically if a chain is, say 6 boxes long
 MSmits: the other player can take 4 boxes
 MSmits: then split the last 2
 MSmits: i mean cap off the last 2
 MSmits: and force the other player to take those 2 and then have to open another chain
 therealbeef: ilke a 'tempo' in chess?
 MSmits: the other guy keeps having to open chains
 MSmits: it's more than just tempo, it's everything
 Galant10f88: Hi (test)
 MSmits: if you enter the endgame not in control the game is basically over, unless you have a big lead in score
 reCurse: I see
 MSmits: reCurse there is also a lot to do with short chains and such. I can't really give a full tutorial on D&amp;B endgames, there's a lot of rules
 MSmits: but let me know if you have any question
 MSmits: say why something happened in a replay
 MSmits: i can probably explain
 reCurse: Sure, though I think my stay will be a short one
 MSmits: allright. I'll await your othello bot&#160;:)
 Rddevelop: surely php is an horrible choice in clash...
 reCurse: After d&amp;b maybe
 Rddevelop: short mode is guarenteed lose
 MSmits: you can still get points if you're 2nd or 3rd
 MSmits: but just learn python... or ruby, but python is a more useful skill probably
 Rddevelop: im forth currently, the python guys ya know
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: i learned python by solving 30 easy puzzles and then doing some projects
 MSmits: you wont be an excellent golfer then, but it's a good start
 Rddevelop: do you like python?
 Rddevelop: people say php sucks anyway
 MSmits: yeah, to code small programs
 MSmits: i wouldnt code anything big in it, because it has its problems
 MSmits: for big projects, use C#
 MSmits: or torture yourself with c++, thats fine too :P
 Rddevelop: hahah
 Astrobytes: PHP has its uses, on here I think people mostly see using PHP as a challenge to themselves. There are a few dedicated PHPers
 MSmits: yeah patrick
 Rddevelop: im on web development so i like php with laravel
 reCurse: A challenge to mental faculties?
 Astrobytes: and T Bali
 Astrobytes: Essentially reCurse yep, I think they both admit that too&#160;:)
 Rddevelop: java and javascript are cool too but pyton i never bothered tbh
 Rddevelop: even to look into it
 Astrobytes: PHP + Laravel&#160;!= trying to code in PHP on here :P
 MSmits: i think python is nicer than JS and C# is nicer than java
 MSmits: of course js and java are more widely used..
 Rddevelop: those are good for me because i can code on node knowing js and  also back-end with java is a posibility
 MSmits: dont have much js knowledge, but i base this judgement of the horror stories of some RL friends
 Astrobytes: It's not a friendly language.
 Astrobytes: IMO
 AlgoRhythmus: rockstar is the very best language ever! ;D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U&amp;t=2797s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U&amp;t=2797s</a>
 Rddevelop: its true that with js and php, them not being robustly typed makes them ugly
 Rddevelop: but typescript is good and php 8.0 is doing good
 Astrobytes: lol Heiwu
 Rddevelop: but i better learn pyton for clash anyway 
 AlgoRhythmus: typescript might also be my next candidate after feeling good in python.
 Astrobytes: Well, choose your tools when you need them.
 Astrobytes: Don't need to like them if you have to use them. Some just make your life harder than it should be.
 Rddevelop: yeah
 Rddevelop: clash is fun, i like coding game overwall
 Rddevelop: so i dont mind learning it just to have more fun
 AlgoRhythmus: i also learning python since about 6 weeks, is really fun.
 Rddevelop: one reason i have not done it yet maybe its because i dont want to confuse a language function with another so i try not to learn much languages and just stick with 2
 Rddevelop: but when i see pyton code in clash, it looks so random and different that i think i wouldnt confuse anything with that
 AlgoRhythmus: i'd give it a try and see if it differs enough.
 Astrobytes: If you're competent in a language and understand what you're doing (ie. not just syntax) then python should be easy enough.
 Rddevelop: yeah
 Astrobytes: I still can't understand how it went from 'used by some people on linux for things' to world-conquering must-learn amazeballs language.
 reCurse: That's python bothering your brain with that?
 AlgoRhythmus: i'd guess data science / "big data" and python notebooks do play a part in that game. and of course its easynes (is that even an english word?)
 reCurse: Javascript should have that attention imo
 AlgoRhythmus: typescript maybe
 AlgoRhythmus: "public static void"... XD
 MSmits: this rockstar video is awesome, thanks Heiwu
 Astrobytes: Yes I can also say the same about js reCurse. I cannot believe that it is what it is today.
 AlgoRhythmus: you're welcome.  the comments are right: "This guy is a great orator/storyteller/and probably DnD master"
 Astrobytes: that's why MSmits loves it, he's looking for a new DM
 Rddevelop: js is everythere tbh
 BananaInSpace: its 5:20PM and i studied 4 hours today im kinda proud :D
 MSmits: nah i have a good dm, multiple even :P
 Astrobytes: I hated js in 2000/2001 and I hate it 100 times more now.
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 AlgoRhythmus: yeah this site is damn addicting - until its daily slow-AF-time in about 1h
 therealbeef: history is littered with inferior products becoming the standard
 AlgoRhythmus: whatsapp :D
 Astrobytes: MSmits: ever use roll20?
 MSmits: dont think so
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i dont have a smartphone remember
 MSmits: i am sure the other guys i play with have used i
 MSmits: it
 Astrobytes: You need a smartphone for it?
 MSmits: i dont know i just googled it and it was an app
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://roll20.net/">https://roll20.net/</a>
 MSmits: ahh I see
 Astrobytes: I guess they have an app
 MSmits: looks cool
 MSmits: I will have to suggest it to them
 MSmits: is this wizards of the coast sanctioned?
 Astrobytes: Yeah a few friends of mine said it was actually pretty good. Not free but worth it. YMMV as always.
 MSmits: they crack down hard on copyright stuff
 BananaInSpace: anyone here have steam? ( gaming app)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, might be tricky to sneak games in there.
 ala89: oof
 Astrobytes: Oh just re-read your comment. It's all above board yeah.
 Astrobytes: (excuse the pun)
 MSmits: ah ok 
 Astrobytes: that's where the payment part comes in 
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for tonight. Gn all
 AlgoRhythmus: gn8
 MSmits: gn

 26: why wait so long to start there's 7 people
 26: god these problems are ass
 AliSsM: Hi
 Salted: What the heck happens around this time that makes the website so slow?
 therealbeef: updates of ranking i guess
 AlgoRhythmus: idkm but its daily
 therealbeef: std::sort&#160;;-)
 struct: I dont even know if its worth to report the bug again
 therealbeef: it might not be a bug
 therealbeef: maybe right now is the moment when least people use the site
 struct: Well they did say it happened when they updated db
 AlgoRhythmus: i hope they do have any kind of monitoring that alerts them about increased errors about this time
 Salted: Well it is 1am there so I assume no one even knows. 
 struct: Well i reported it before
 struct: In December
 Salted: but it's prime time in the states so I'm guessing they just set it up to run when it's nighttime wherever the servers are. 
 mihaipriboi: it s 2 am in romania and i still play...
 therealbeef: it's primetime in east coast USA, right? not west coast
 Salted: 4:23 west coast
 therealbeef: it might really be the quietest moment globally
 Pietrek: 2 am in Poland :D
 Pietrek: but coders-of-the-caribbean is so fun&#160;:)
 MACKEYTH: Hello all. I need some help finding something.
 MACKEYTH: Is there a list of the command identifiers available in Monaco? I want to change some keybindgs
 Severed: PYTHON: do we have access to numpy or spicy here?
 Salted: numpy for sure
 Severed: awesome, thanks
 Salted: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Severed: sweet, has both. TYPOd scipy as spicy lol
 Salted: Can we fix the character count issues with the codegolf stuff? It doesn't count unicode characters as part of the solution. So the codegolf guys can just use unicode characters to reduce their codesize.  
 Salted: Is that true? Are there special chars that codingame can't count?
 struct: it counts chars not bytes
 Salted: So that's how someone is able to solve codegolf challenges in C with only 36 characters?
 struct: its probably just a system call
 struct: you can run bash code in multiple languages
 Westicles: I don't it.  You can't call bash from C with only 5 characters overhead
 Westicles: *doubt
 Westicles: Probably submits random answers a thousand times
 Salted: Hmm, would be cool if the validation answers changed once in a while. 
 Salted: But also I guess I feel better. I was thinking there's no way I'll ever get to the point I could do a real solution in 36 chars
 Westicles: Yep, they should put it on the home page... golf solutions are all sort of cheating, and those guys beating you in CoC are all bots
 Westicles: Or in a FAQ I guess

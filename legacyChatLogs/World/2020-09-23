 MadKnight: too many clash links in chat Automaton2000, we gotta do something about it
 Automaton2000: i'm in the middle of the night

 yt2951: Hi :wave:
 Tanvirt073: hello
 jacek: good morning
 MadKnight: how did your kutulu go, guys&#160;?
 jacek: i let them win
 codeing: guy what's up&#160;?
 codeing: some person can tell what 3d programing platform exist online&#160;?
 jacek: well there was 3d teapot contribution on CG :v
 codeing: can i have a link&#160;?
 codeing: @jacek&#160;?
 jacek: hmm its not there anymore
 uvBoss: was it not euler's?
 jacek: eeyup
 Lafihalas: Coders strike back: how long does the shield last&#160;?
 VuHoangHiep: @portpass please teach me python
 Pussy_destroyer: +
 Uljahn: Lafihalas: 1 turn, but you can reactivate it
 RobkePila: px
 Zenkov: Valfi
 PositiveQuark: Hey, how can I open a new room without posting the hashtagged name in the chat?
 PositiveQuark: Nevermind, guess who found the help button&#160;:)
 Danotris: You&#160;?
 PositiveQuark: Is that a trick question? 
 jacek: no
 Lafihalas: Uljahn: Thanks&#160;!
 KAIn: hey, I approved a contribution that is accessible by now, and my quest map didn't update. Did anyone experience something similar?
 KAIn: or, maybe I am missing something hmm
 SeebOmega: i got this some time ago but in fact it was removed and not fully accepted 
 SeebOmega: after that i accepted another contrib that was accepted and my quest map did update
 jacek: huh there is a quest for accepting contributions? :f
 Uljahn: and then for making one, so 3D teapot was a quest accomplishing contribution 
 jacek: but that encourages crappy contributions to be accepted :s
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's nice to see so many new contribs but I fear quality may suffer
 darkhorse64: One fibonacci puzzle a day
 Astrobytes: I suppose they can get away with that if they're clashes (according to the guidelines) but puzzles...
 Dhamer: guys is there any low lvl puzzle all i can see  are high lvl puzzel like 5 stars
 jrke: stars is not level its the score that how much people liked it
 Dhamer: ah thx i thought it indicate the difficulity lvl
 Dhamer: thanks
 Astrobytes: hey jrke
 jrke: hello astrobytes

 KishanGhising: helloo
 NIgga: allo
 NIgga: i dont understand shit man
 NIgga: i literally do not understnad naything
 KishanGhising: :joy:
 NIgga: i literalyl need mentan help
 NIgga: i tried to learn coding today but
 NIgga: i just been doing nothing
 NIgga: like how do u fucking code it makes no fucking sense
 NIgga: i fucking swear master bating is a better 
 NIgga: thing to do then this shit rn 
 Astrobytes: Do you understand that you'll get kicked for talking like that?
 bich: nope 
 Danotris: Smell that&#160;? I think a ban is coming our way 
 Adbal99: That's n word D:
 bich: what n word?
 bich: my frustation to this shit is insane
 bich: i fucking hell i fucking trying and shit aint working
 Q12: so ask someone for help
 bich: can u help me&#160;;[
 Q12: What do you need?
 bich: i literally
 bich: have no idea wtf iam doing
 bich: literally 
 Q12: What lang do you want to learn?
 Q12: And stop cursing
 bich: i heard java script is good
 bich:  aight G
 Q12: ok
 Q12: so I can help you with that
 bich: aight so where the fuck do i start
 bich: cause my down ass is sitting in shit right now
 bich: i am at the quest map and all i am and i have no idea wtf i am doing
 Q12: I wont to help you if you keep cursing
 bich: easy as pie more 
 bich: aight og oh k k k k H
 bich: bruh but what i do now
 Q12: I recommend to start with practice
 Q12: go to Practice

 Q12: choose Easy lvls
 bich: aight
 Q12: and start solving one
 bich: just clicking
 bich: yup there a promblem
 bich: i dont understand how to slove one
 bich: i am dead ASSS dumb
 Q12: tell me the name of the puzzle you have chosen, and try to realx
 bich: Ghost legs 
 bich: bruh i am trying too man 
 bich: i dont understanDDDD
 bich: i dk where to start
 Q12: Private
 bich: what&#160;?
 Q12: chat
 bich: howww
 SPARROT: why private
 Q12: You also want help?
 Q12: I don't want to interrupt everyone
 Tanvirt073: hey guys who is using python?
 SeebOmega: Is there a problem here or you found a solution&#160;? 
 jacek: python? that esoteric language?
 Q12: :laughing:
 Q12: I am Tanvirt073 , but started just few weeks ago
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: stop collecting my personal info
 Automaton2000: i have the same issues
 sparky: automaton2000: how do you BOOST in haskell?
 Automaton2000: but it never reaches it
 widemouthfrog1: I'm having trouble with Code vs Zombies. I keep getting the warning about desynchronized outputs randomly. Sometimes a test will get the warning and fail. I've checked the inputs and outputs with print statements and they're fine. It happens more frequently with more zombies
 sparky: I haven't done that much, but you are probably missing some input data. Make sure you read the correct number of humans and zombies - it changes each turn
 widemouthfrog1: Every turn It reads the same number of humans and zombies as the number given, I counted them. It also doesn't happen often for few zombies and sometimes doesn't happen for many zombies
 eulerscheZahl: i'm with sparky, you probably miss some input readingpaste your code to the chat if you want help
 widemouthfrog1: The whole thing? It's 200 lines
 eulerscheZahl: do it or find the issue on your own
 widemouthfrog1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d9c89afd-be2f-42ec-b3a4-715454dbb9ad">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d9c89afd-be2f-42ec-b3a4-715454dbb9ad</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, pastebins are broken again&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: pastebin.com then
 widemouthfrog1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/3LNy6Csm">https://pastebin.com/3LNy6Csm</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i ran it a few time, didn't get a warning so far
 eulerscheZahl: looking at your code i don't see an issue either
 widemouthfrog1: I can send an image of the console on discord, I tried reloading the page but it's still happening
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 jacek: have you tried internet explorer
 mj61: hiii]
 widemouthfrog1: Thank you for your help. My problem has been solved. My algorithm was just timing out with large numbers of zombies and can be fixed by making the time I allow for each turn based on the number of zombies
 SeebOmega: widemouthfrog1 also you can just break whatever you are doing ehen you run out of time
 widemouthfrog1: How do you know when you've run out of time without checking constantly?
 eulerscheZahl: he already does that SeebOmega
 SeebOmega: i check it after each simulations 1 simulations shouldn t be more tahn a ms 
 SeebOmega: ok my bad 
 eulerscheZahl: i added a simulation counter. it's not that high but high enough to be fine when checking after each iteration
 eulerscheZahl: but in some cases it's much higher:
 SeebOmega: also i see he breaks at 90ms which should leave at least 10 ms to finish maybe a edge case with no output
 eulerscheZahl: lightshot is slow at uploading&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/lGAufwA">https://imgur.com/a/lGAufwA</a>
 eulerscheZahl: I added some logging:console.error(Date.now() - myTime);
 eulerscheZahl: maybe random garbage collection causing a massive slowdown, don't know
 eulerscheZahl: you have 150ms per turn. but even that 60ms safety margin isn't enough
 eulerscheZahl: i know it says 100ms in the statement. but that's a lie
 widemouthfrog1: It could be the copying of zombies on line 172
 widemouthfrog1: And all other copies like it
 Q12: I have a question what is better:making a two dimensional array or making a one dimension array when both have the same number of cells in total. Tell me from the run time point of view and the space. (Maybe they are same?)
 Q12: Thank you
 Noisestorm: Hey all,
 Noisestorm: Do you guys know how to share your profile and at the same time be able to show every doce you wrote/submitted?
 Noisestorm: *code
 Noisestorm: Obviously for CV purposes
 eulerscheZahl: your profile: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/6fd26e5ad551969b53d688825dace3397633043">https://www.codingame.com/profile/6fd26e5ad551969b53d688825dace3397633043</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can't share your code, it's private.
 Q12: I have a question what is better:making a two dimensional array or making a one dimension array when both have the same number of cells in total. Can you me from the run time point of view and the space. (Maybe they are same?)Thank you :slight_smile:
 Noisestorm: So recruiters can only see my achievements and not the code I write?
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 Noisestorm: I understand the concern about people copying code, but if the effort I put into coding here on CodinGame could be recognized by companies, then I would definitely spend more time on the site
 Astrobytes: Keep it in a private github repo for that purpose only
 Noisestorm: Yeah I thought about that, will probably do so, thanks anyways
 eulerscheZahl: rank high in the next contest and only share that one code
 Noisestorm: Also true, thanks for the tip
 jrke: euler always do half part of what he wrote "rank high in contest"  :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: because he is the Almighty Toad
 eulerscheZahl: so if I say that a high ranking is top50 then half of it is top25?
 Metanoob: :D
 Astrobytes: Think he meant half of the sentence&#160;;)
 jrke: euler in that way i wanted to be 2nd in any contest
 Q12: I have a question what is better:making a two dimensional array or making a one dimension array when both have the same number of cells in total. Can you me from the run time point of view and the space. (Maybe they are same?)Thank you :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i still have that dream too
 eulerscheZahl: which language Q12?
 eulerscheZahl: memory management is highly different depending on your answer
 Q12: js
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm out
 Q12: :laughing: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: asking a performance question for JS sounds odd anyways :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 Q12: I want to make hash table but don't know which one to choose
 Astrobytes: maybe check SO?
 Q12: How?
 Metanoob: hashtable will be faster, I assume you mean {} vs []? Am I wrong?
 eulerscheZahl: with your favorite search engine
 Astrobytes: Look for the question on stackoverflow / google it
 Q12: Metanoob I meant to 2D or 1D
 Metanoob: ye that's what I thought at first, I got distracted by the last message I guess
 Q12: Astrobytes  I tried but didn't found anything
 Q12: *something to help me
 Metanoob: for allocation, a VERY LARGE 1D array, for which all indices are used (not a sparse array, look it up if you wanna know more about those)
 Metanoob: if you know in advance the final size of your array
 Metanoob: new Array(&lt;size&gt;)
 eulerscheZahl: does JS even have a 2D array? or is it an array of arrays?
 Metanoob: it's an array of arrays
 eulerscheZahl: then you add an extra level of indirection
 eulerscheZahl: so i suppose a large 1D array would perform better (untested)
 Metanoob: yeah and it also depends on the js engine behind&#160;:/
 Q12: How can I test it? with Date.now()?
 Astrobytes: You can always try to benchmark the two
 Metanoob: yess benchmark is usually helpful
 Q12: Ok. Thanks :slight_smile:
 Metanoob: js is great for prototyping algorithms, not so good for testing high performance at memory level
 Metanoob: I think it's the first time I chat with any programming community online (SO doesn't count alright :p)
 eulerscheZahl: come back in 1.5 months during the contest. then this community will be a lot more active
 Astrobytes: ^ oh yeah
 Metanoob: yeah? Are you participating?
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 Metanoob: both of you actually?
 Astrobytes: Yes, most likely
 Metanoob: nice
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020</a>the last contest, to give you an idea of what to expect
 Metanoob: I participated in challenges on codingame a few years ago
 Metanoob: it seems similar
 Astrobytes: Yeah, try a few multiplayers to get in shape for it
 Metanoob: I mean the way it is organized
 Astrobytes: Yes, not too much has changed in that regard
 Metanoob: nice codingame is one of the platforms I always come back to at some point
 Metanoob: along with hackerrank 
 Q12: I am tring to get to the gold league in this contest right now :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: i lost interest in hackerrank when they stopped hosting contests&#160;:(
 Metanoob: nice good luck!
 Metanoob: oh they stopped?
 Metanoob: I didn't even pay atttention
 Q12: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: at some point it was contests with limited participants like women only or India only
 eulerscheZahl: then it stopped entirely
 Astrobytes: CG has a better feel to it anyway
 Metanoob: uf
 Metanoob: yeah here 
 eulerscheZahl: it's just different. hackerrank is more like codeforces: shorter rounds with a clearly correct answer
 Metanoob: the visual debugging and the animations are pretty good
 eulerscheZahl: CG is more fuzzy
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's true
 Metanoob: right well put
 Metanoob: have you guys tried the nintendo puzzle on CG?
 eulerscheZahl: tried and cried
 Metanoob: yuuuup
 Astrobytes: Oh that, hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: the only official puzzle remaining unsolved for me
 Metanoob: really? damn man got some serious skills
 Astrobytes: Something about field theory wrt that Nintendo thing right? Beyond me anyway
 eulerscheZahl: marchete mentioned galois fields
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy said that's only a minor part of it
 Astrobytes: that's the one yeah
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what to search for
 Astrobytes: "nintendo puzzle solution"&#160;? :P
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 Metanoob: haha good one
 Metanoob: I didn't actually research, I was just trying to solve it... which is probably why I didn't :D
 Astrobytes: Believe me, there's a certain demographic who solve puzzles just like that
 eulerscheZahl: you'll definitely need some maths background
 Metanoob: yeah I believe you
 eulerscheZahl: or github background...
 Astrobytes: lol
 Metanoob: :D
 Metanoob: I mean I don't have a solid background in math... but I read about crypto and some algorithms - but this is rly tough 
 Metanoob: galois fields you said I should have a look at?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but i did too, didn't help me
 Astrobytes: It's outside my skillset, I pick my battles wisely :D
 Metanoob: maybe I should try to solve all the other ones before trying this one 
 Metanoob: haha :p
 jacek: try double rot13
 jacek: Astrobytes isnt mod?
 eulerscheZahl: what did jacek just write?i can't read this encrypted message
 eulerscheZahl: he still is - but offline it seems
 eulerscheZahl: only those users currently online when you login are shown as mods
 Westicles: This guy goes over the math <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BUnm-bnik">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_BUnm-bnik</a>
 eulerscheZahl: hm, that seems to be too specific about the challenge. would feel like cheating&#160;:(
 Westicles: Well, the whole thing is just math majors trying to feel special.  Not really a fair problem for anyone else
 Astrobytes: sorry, had to go and make food
 Metanoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/141e6bbc-707d-4cd8-aa3d-da0354af3c7e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/141e6bbc-707d-4cd8-aa3d-da0354af3c7e</a>
 Metanoob: woops, I was just trying to tell euler that jacek said the following:try double rot13Astrobytes isnt mod?
 Astrobytes: yeah I got it Metanoob, thanks, not too much chat so still visible&#160;:)
 Metanoob: oh alright sorry :p
 Astrobytes: oh, wait. I think he was joking regarding the encryption thing
 Astrobytes: I'm slow off t he mark this week
 Metanoob: ah okay, I would have been surprised too - would be too nice if it were caesar
 Astrobytes: that would be very far from a Very Hard puzzle :P
 Metanoob: haha ye
 Metanoob: yeah I'm always slow off the mark that's why I don't usually chat so much
 VictorSmith: Stuck on C# Temperatures, how to check what value in an array that is closest to 0? x)
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, everyone is welcome Metanoob
 Metanoob: woop woop glad to be here
 Metanoob: VictorSmith, I don't recall that challenge I probably didn't see it yet, would sorting the array help?
 Astrobytes: VictorSmith: that's a search engine question, not puzzle-specific
 Astrobytes: Look up C# documentation or stackoverflow
 VictorSmith: Tried a few searches but couldn't find a proper solution&#160;:/ Will check into sorting though!
 Astrobytes: Cool, good luck&#160;:)
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures</a>
 VictorSmith: Thanks!
 Metanoob: good luck!!
 Metanoob: thanks jacek I will check it out
 jacek: its encrypted with double rot13 though
 Astrobytes: lol
 Metanoob: alright jacek, that was just perfect haha
 CopperFr: arrête de tronquer AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: that's why i am a noob 
 jacek: oh my
 Uljahn: stop being a noob AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: hey guys i have a question about the problem with the output of the game info the more complex code
 YusufEmad04: hey
 VictorSmith: Question: If I have a multiple testcase task, and task 1 wants me to print a positive number, and case 2 only negative numbers, am I supposed to complete task 1, change the code, and then complete task 2? In other words, am I supposed to not complete all the cases in the same code and then run all testcases?
 Uljahn: you need to create universal code which passes all the testcases
 VictorSmith: But they're mutually exclusive in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures</a>
 VictorSmith: I can't paste the answer for question 1 (Answer is 1) and question 2, which are only negative numbers.
 Uljahn: that's called hardcode when you output predefined number
 Uljahn: your code should work for any inputs in given ranges
 LastRick: The puzzle isn't asking you to print a positive or a negative number; it wants you to print the CORRECT number, regardless of its sign. So maybe you could store the numbers in a way so that -- once you decide which input is correct -- you come back and print it.
 VictorSmith: I just realised I could probably just store the answers in an array and loop through it.. &gt;.&lt;
 jacek: :O
 Uljahn: have you solved The Descent puzzle? it has a hints button with a sample solution, so you could have a look for reference
 VictorSmith: I, for some stupid reason, thought that you were supposed to do a WriteLine for each case xD
 Uljahn: ah
 jacek: oO
 VictorSmith: Think I've got it now lmao
 Astrobytes: Ah. No, don't hardcode
 VictorSmith: I blame my lack of coffee..
 Astrobytes: No no, you have to write code that will solve the general case
 Astrobytes: So, no matter what testcase you throw at it, your code will produce the correct answer
 VictorSmith: Yeah went too far down the rabbithole to print correct answer for case 1 and then completely forgot I'm supposed to loop answers instead of hardcoding them lol
 jacek: O_O
 Astrobytes: Don't loop over the answers, loop over the temperatures sure, but not an array of the correct answers for each testcase
 VictorSmith: Oh, no no. But have the console output in a loop I meant.
 Astrobytes: Nope. Your code will be run for each testcase (actually, validators which are similar but different) when you submit. So you just need to output once
 VictorSmith: Oh.. The more you know! So hard to figure this out
 Astrobytes: The input/output situation on CG can be a bit strange for some people initially, don't worry&#160;:)
 VictorSmith: Yeah it's a hurdle! Probably missed something explaining it though idk
 Astrobytes: It's not really explained tbh, just assumed. That may change sometime
 VictorSmith: Mostly just so different from running in your own IDE where you can set debug points and show all printouts
 Astrobytes: Well, you can develop in IDE, and copy the inputs from the testcases for a lot of puzzles
 VictorSmith: Might do that at some point if I get stuck further down the line! Code I had worked simply by removing the extra console outputs like you said&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Awesome! Yeah, you can do custom testcases too, if you need to test some edge case or whatever
 VictorSmith: Sweet :D
 eulerscheZahl: other sites like hackerrank, codeforces, ... use the same approach of reading input and printing output.but if you are new to the concept, it can be confusing
 eulerscheZahl: there was another website "codeeval" that confused me at first.they had some starter code similar to CG. when i extended it, i always failed the testcases. i was also wondering why it was so hard to read (gray text on darker gray background)
 eulerscheZahl: turned out the starter code was completely commented :D
 eulerscheZahl: codeeval doesn't even exist anymore
 Astrobytes: hahaha, brilliant
 eulerscheZahl: they gave you points for the difficulty of the puzzle. and subtracted some for time and memory consumption of your code
 jacek: memory consumptions? this is MSmists <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/030/710/dd0.jpg">https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/030/710/dd0.jpg</a>
 VictorSmith: Yeah I personally have only been on this site actively for like 4 hours , and like 2 hours on a different one like.. 6 - 7 months ago? x)
 Astrobytes: Well, now you know how it works so you're good to go
 jacek: wait till he makes prune array
 Astrobytes: There's puzzles, multiplayer bot programming, optimisation and clashes too
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 jacek: w00t little golem reset players rating to 1500&#160;:?
 Astrobytes: That's the board gaming site right?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: looks like some bug
 Astrobytes: Haven't tried it out, it's good? (when it isn't bugged)
 jacek: too bad its correspondence only
 Astrobytes: Oh, long games
 jacek: i just started bot few weeks ago
 jacek: yeah, very long. 24h for move
 Astrobytes: Oh nice. They allow bots?
 Astrobytes: Hey I used to play chess by mail with my grandad back in the day lol
 jacek: apparently. at least from the names i saw
 Astrobytes: Cool
 jacek: and in 1 paper describing bot they used littlegolem to see how strong their bot was
 Astrobytes: "So then we waited a whole year for the game to finish"
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: they have LYNGK, TZAAR, DVONNstruct wanted to port those I think
 Astrobytes: *Houdini, not struct
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: huh
 Astrobytes: And yeah, I recall him talking about those
 Astrobytes: (Houdini, he disappears and reappears unexpectedly)
 jacek: like that chess engine
 Astrobytes: And he was almost done with Amazons
 jacek: 10x10?
 Astrobytes: Not sure
 Astrobytes: When I get some time I want to do Morpion Solitaire
 Astrobytes: Multi and optim
 jacek: another NRPA?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I believe that gets good results
 Astrobytes: But, CG players are always full of surprises
 Astrobytes: Plus the platform restrictions (time etc) always make for interesting results
 Astrobytes: I should check with aCat that he wasn't planning that one actually
 Zoe_Witte18: I can't sorry
 jacek: youre not from canada?
 Zoe_Witte18: No
 JBM: blame canada
 VictorSmith: How do people specify to boost when they are in range of the final goal on the pod racing game? Is there a variable to check?
 The_Auditor: somebody said canada?
 The_Auditor: i am from Canada
 JBM: naaaw, you don't exist
 The_Auditor: @VictorSmith before boosting i check that the pod is oriented well, and has some speed already, otherwise either end up of track of boost is wasted
 The_Auditor: ... but i'm not the best, so what do i know...
 VictorSmith: Yeah doing that as well, just noticed that some people somehow manage to boost on the last stretch before the goal on lap 3/3, when they've had the same conditions met before
 The_Auditor: and i don't exist
 The_Auditor: they probably wait the distance to goal to be smaller
 VictorSmith: Right
 The_Auditor: i personally did not like the racing ... i like the Ice and fire and the Kutulu
 The_Auditor: the racing is the first because it is easy to get something going
 Astrobytes: Yeah, hard to pick a suitable first multiplayer game for all, like The_Auditor was getting at it's kind of OK for just setting the scene so to speak, get used to how the multis work etc
 VictorSmith: Is there any documentation for the Code Royale? Kind of at a loss as to where to even begin coding x)
 VictorSmith: The quick help and rules don't really make any sense before you've got going it feels like.
 Astrobytes: That was my first contest lol, maybe try a multi with less inputs? :D
 VictorSmith: But it looks so adorable&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, all good. You can check this out:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFtRcK0VzQ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFtRcK0VzQ8</a>
 Astrobytes: It's by the game author and it's in Kotlin but it might give you some ideas
 Astrobytes: And there's a few walkthroughs for multis/contests on the CG youtube channel
 VictorSmith: Forget that you can play things in different languages, I'm doing it in C# right now. Guess I'd have to start by creating some form of object class
 VictorSmith: Will give the YT a look at some point though, thanks for the tip!
 The_Auditor: THERE IS a CG YOUTUBE CHANNEL&#160;!?
 Astrobytes: yes&#160;;)

 AntiSquid: we already have a smit here, there can be only one so we need to get rid of one Automaton2000
 Astrobytes: The_Auditor: Mostly just for advertising contests and contest programming streams
 Automaton2000: yes, this is my code
 Astrobytes: Another one VictorSmith (and anyone else):<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/first-programming-contest/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/first-programming-contest/</a>
 VictorSmith: Got me some reading to do I see! :D
 Astrobytes: Contest-oriented but still applicable since the multis are al previous contests
 Astrobytes: *all (except the user contributed ones)
 Astrobytes: Well, not strictly true but that'll do for now
 AntiSquid: the one on tech IO gives me a weird error when going through the pages of that tutorial

 AntiSquid: this one has no such error
 The_Auditor: Automaton2000 is my friend
 Automaton2000: the only reason i can think of
 Astrobytes: Hm, is that related to the code-running error on tech.io that pops up now and then I wonder, AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: when you have friends like Automaton2000 you don't need foes, i'd look for new friends The_Auditor
 Automaton2000: he said he is not doing it
 The_Auditor: LOL
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 is the best friend
 Automaton2000: yeah, i guess it is the only option
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 yes
 Automaton2000: can also be used for the next one?
 Astrobytes: Things seem to work when the tech.io stuff is referred from CG but not if you do it directly on tech.io
 AntiSquid: sounds like he takes ownership of you folks
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 next one can be friend too
 Automaton2000: in the case where there is no limit
 Astrobytes: I give up
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 have no limit for friends
 Automaton2000: i don't know why i cant get out of wood
 DomiKo: Automaton2000 ask your friend for help
 Automaton2000: but that was before my time
 AntiSquid: cyberpunk? is that you&#160;?
 DomiKo: Automaton2000  when we can play cyberpunk?
 Automaton2000: i am running out of nodes

 DomiKo: interesting
 AntiSquid: good night .
 DomiKo: good night

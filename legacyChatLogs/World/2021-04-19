 struct: Should I even paste the move generation on slcc feedback?
 struct: I think the main reason my bot failed is because I didnt work on my eval
 Astrobytes: Sure, if you think it adds something
 struct: How can we pm in the forum? I wanted to pm tbali
 struct: to ask him if he wants to join
 Astrobytes: Find a post by him and click on his username is the fastest way I guess
 struct: done
 Astrobytes: Cool, nice one
 struct: Im not sure the move gen adds much
 struct: The only difference is that it takes into account 2 angles
 struct: instead of 1
 Astrobytes: Well, just give it a mention if appropriate then

 Marchete: Can someone help me with the descent?
 sanath-cousin: h
 struct: solve it on paper first
 struct: or press hints on the left
 Marchete: good idea struct
 AntiSquid: for descent write a simulation, also collect replay data and analyse it first 
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey! I found a bug in onboarding, where can I report it?
 Marchete: just make a new forum post and PM moderators
 KiwiTae: stop making fun of newcomers laaa they gonna walk out :p
 AntiSquid: who you calling new comer&#160;? 1 vs 1 me KiwiTae, see who's brest
 derjack: breast?
 BlaiseEbuth: Brest?
 bready-to-code111111: funy
 AntiSquid: best *
 KiwiTae: its the city i live in atm
 Astrobytes: Actually Brest is appropriate
 Astrobytes: see
 Astrobytes: So Kiwi is officially brest
 AntiSquid: typo, the letters are next to each other and i have chubby sausage fingers, stop making fun
 Astrobytes: No really, he moved to Brest, bretagne, France
 derjack: fix your -2.29 chess bot
 BlaiseEbuth: Brest is in Taipei&#160;? I should review my geography...
 Astrobytes: Tell them KiwiTae
 bready-to-code111111: France and Taipei are easily confused, the names are very similar. 
 BlaiseEbuth: True
 AntiSquid: he moved to europe he said so
 Marchete: probably if you compare it on Javascript
 struct: lol
 Marchete: True or False on JS is a leap of faith
 AntiSquid: woah ... the JS haters at it again
 Astrobytes: It's true though! (or is it? :D )
 struct: Give me a reason to love javascript
 AntiSquid: you can't force love
 bready-to-code111111: scratch is best language

 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: don't get the reference
 KiwiTae: its cold as f 
 struct: Really?
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course, he's in Bretagne, not in France

 KiwiTae: its like 11°C
 AntiSquid: it's colder everywhere this year
 BlaiseEbuth: Virus fault

 AntiSquid: had snow in april
 struct: Houses are not made for this
 BlaiseEbuth: Just build other houses

 <b>**BlaiseEbuth is sorry for this easy one</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: It may be cold and wet KiwiTae but always remember en Bretagne, il ne pleut que sur les cons

 AntiSquid: how good is your french from 1 to 10 KiwiTae
 KiwiTae: 9 I guess
 derjack: omelette du fromage?
 AntiSquid: how well do you understand hard-syllable-skipping french speakers? 
 KiwiTae: c'est la vie le paing ohlala
 KiwiTae: AntiSquid no clue I haven't interact with people so far, lockdown , no social circle
 AntiSquid: lockdowns are the reason it's colder probably, less carbon emissions, less green house effect
 Therabidpanther: i suppose that could make sense
 Marchete: so are you telling me I need to burn oil and stuff to avoid an ice age?
 Marchete: makes sense
 KiwiTae: its due to la Nina in the pacific, cools down the surface a bit

 Marchete: like it was a f*king achievement with  teraflops...
 Astrobytes: what is this sorcery
 struct: Just wait until you find that the secret to beat humans was to add a opening book
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 AntiSquid: you could invite the author to CG to advertise his book better 
 derjack: is this what reCurse bought to beat me at that game
 BlaiseEbuth: reCurse bought nothing to beat you
 derjack: except new PC
 BlaiseEbuth: He bought a new pc to beat you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: are pc parts available again?

 AntiSquid: GPUs nowhere to be found
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do you need pc parts when you can have a complete one... :rolling_eyes:
 struct: if I had a 3000 series I would sell it
 AntiSquid: ya good profit struct
 AntiSquid: because i am not paying extra for pre-built BlaiseEbuth
 derjack: or preprint
 BlaiseEbuth: You prefer don't pay at all and stay with your old pc.
 AntiSquid: there are few companies that allow you to pick your parts and they build it for you, but even then i would be worried about them selectively leaving out parts that accidentally above average
 lastshamp: :poop:
 AntiSquid: it's like 6 months old geez, i don't know how i'll survive

 inoryy: fyi: 0% of what you pay goes to the authors
 struct: 0%?
 Marchete: this can't be true
 Marchete: no royalties at all?
 inoryy: welcome to academia
 Marchete: like almost 40eur for some paper and nothing for the authors?
 BlaiseEbuth: Scientists are like artists, they're paid in visibility.
 inoryy: it's quite literally 0.
 Marchete: they are paid in prestige
 Marchete: do you have a lot of prestige, inoryy?
 Marchete: btw&#160;:)
 inoryy: moreover sometimes you can get a free copy if you just email the authors, as they retain the rights
 BlaiseEbuth: Or you can just use a downloader
 inoryy: don't think so? how would I measure it&#160;: D
 inoryy: I mean I'm not saying there's a simple way to bypass the paywall but I'm saying if you did use it then authors would literally lose nothing
 Astrobytes: Yep. Researchers do the work so journals and sites can make money.
 BlaiseEbuth: Pretty normal.
 BlaiseEbuth: :money_mouth:
 Marchete: I would never bother an author for a paper tbt
 inoryy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/hwitteman/status/1015049411276300289?lang=en">https://twitter.com/hwitteman/status/1015049411276300289?lang=en</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: ez money
 inoryy: also I'm not saying there's a simple way to bypass the paywall that you should use, but if there were then the book you linked would definitely be available through it
 BlaiseEbuth: C'mon inoryy, everybody here knows the way. ^^
 struct: Can confirm, I profited a total of 0€ from all the papers I published.
 BlaiseEbuth: But how much prestige!
 Marchete: prestige worldwide

 inoryy: Marchete not sure if you saw before, but I stumbled on your Mokka project -- nice work!
 Marchete: I don't know what I was doing
 Astrobytes: Well, if that's not high praise I don't know what is&#160;:)
 Marchete: so I beg your pardon on stupid stuff I did in that repo
 inoryy: pardon granted
 BlaiseEbuth: Mokka is pretty good cake.
 BlaiseEbuth: +a
 Marchete: Convolution layers is a hell to do it in AVX2
 Marchete: there seem to be some info around
 Marchete: but damn
 Marchete: are*
 inoryy: yeah, can imagine
 struct: I think re curse mentioned that avx512 is a little more friendly for NNs
 Marchete: yes, I found a lot of info on higher AVX versions
 Marchete: in most cases AVX2 is ignored
 Marchete: even by Intel
 Marchete: or it's overly complex
 Marchete: so I gave up on that
 MSmits: hey Marchete I am using your Mokka thingy to jumpstart my machine learning experimentation, so thanks a lot
 MSmits: the fact that i know i can use it in a CG bot, means i can use TF
 Marchete: I'm trying to use it, but still I'm working on the jacekmax
 MSmits: ah ok, i've written jacekmax before
 MSmits: it's very similar to mcts with ept
 MSmits: except you backpropagate minimax style
 Marchete: I'm trying to do a monster
 MSmits: what monster?
 Marchete: jacek+smitsi+max
 MSmits: i am not sure that is possible
 Marchete: hence the monster
 MSmits: smitsi relies on statistics that are decoupled between agents. If you maximize, then you need exactness
 MSmits: the whole idea about smitsimax is that the fuzzy statistics makes it work
 MSmits: but if you maximize, you cant rely on that
 Marchete: right now I don't trust the maximize part
 MSmits: you can trust it if you have a single, exact game tree
 Marchete: after N visits the code sees that another branch is much better
 Marchete: and changes the whole max() part
 MSmits: well I translated my mcts with ept to jacekmax in oware and got same rank
 MSmits: as in above all non-nn, below the nn
 Marchete: nice
 Marchete: jacekmax without rollouts, right?
 MSmits: mcts with ept seemed to be somewhat stronger, but eval was tuned for mcts with ept
 MSmits: yes without rollouts, eval
 Marchete: right now the jacekmax is about 30th, but my minimax is like 15th
 MSmits: just eval children
 Marchete: eval children is costly
 MSmits: depends on the eval
 Marchete: he takes out the policy part of the alphazero
 Marchete: in exchange of more game simulations
 MSmits: well its not really alpha zero
 inoryy: &gt; MSmits 04:30PM&gt; i am not sure that is possiblefamous last words
 MSmits: well in this case it just makes no sense to me inoryy, I didnt mean it is hard
 Marchete: can't the negamax part suddenly find a trap and "invalidate" the best branch?
 Marchete: like even if you have a lot of visits
 MSmits: yeah, it can, but mcts can skip traps too
 Marchete: I mean negamax inherently can fall in traps that change a lot the propagated score
 MSmits: not really
 Marchete: I thought it can happen the same on smitsi
 MSmits: because it's min maxed
 Therabidpanther: regex is the devil
 BlaiseEbuth: No. I'm
 Therabidpanther: oh
 MSmits: so if it suddenly raises the score a lot, the parent will just not be picked
 MSmits: so extremes will disappear
 MSmits: the biggest problem is the horizon effect
 MSmits: because the player who's turn it is might have an inherent advantage or disadvantage
 MSmits: so if the dept between leafs is not the same
 MSmits: some leafs may be p1 and some may be p2
 MSmits: eval can correct this partially
 MSmits: I usually have player-turn as part of my eval score
 Marchete: do you prefer jacekmax or MCTS-EPT?
 MSmits: but jacekmax, just like smitsimax has some features that makes you question why it would even work, but it does, I tested it for oware, jacek tested it everywhere
 MSmits: mcts-ept
 MSmits: because i know why it works generally
 MSmits: jacekmax is a bit weird
 Marchete: I don't like the negamax part
 Marchete: I prefer sumScore/visits
 MSmits: why  not, mcts also has negamax
 Marchete: the max() part
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well then it's just mcts with ept
 MSmits: use that instead
 MSmits: if you do sumscore/visit i mean
 MSmits: it works fine if your eval is good
 Marchete: fine?
 MSmits: it's very simple to convert one way to the other, just a few lines of code
 MSmits: similar i mean
 MSmits: at least for oware
 Marchete: fine doesn't mean good or excellent
 MSmits: jacek says in some games, one was better and in other games, the other
 Marchete: it's just okiish
 MSmits: no, i mean i beat everyone with both algos
 Marchete: top 30 or so
 MSmits: except the NN's
 MSmits: i can beat the NNs by cheating with a counter book though :P:
 Marchete: do you save gamestates on MCTS nodes?
 Marchete: or replay the whole thing
 MSmits: in some games yeah
 MSmits: actually in most
 MSmits: if the state fits in 128 bit or less
 Marchete: with an NN is harder to keep books
 Marchete: no left
 Marchete: no space left
 MSmits: i doubt that, why not just make a smaller nn
 Marchete: I was thinking that
 Marchete: keeping in 128 bits
 MSmits: which game is this?
 MSmits: oware?&gt;
 Marchete: oware, yes
 MSmits: my state is 64 bit :grin:
 Marchete: oh :D
 MSmits: well + score sry
 MSmits: the board is 64 bit
 MSmits: and then i have score also
 MSmits: so another 16 bit
 Marchete: I have tons of useless info on MCTS nodes
 MSmits: my state is: 5 bit per pit = 60 bit
 MSmits: then 4 bits left over
 MSmits: for the max 1 pit that has &gt; 30 seeds
 struct: marchet you ever tried to calculate value of childs with avx?
 struct: to get the best one
 Marchete: hmm,no, not in boards
 Marchete: maybe you can do it in sim games
 MSmits: did you want to avx oware Marchete?
 Marchete: noooo
 Marchete: I wanted to do AVX for Convolution layers
 MSmits: i think I have one of the fastest implementations for sim in oware, but no avx
 Marchete: my sim is ugly and buffy
 Marchete: buggy*
 MSmits: I do a bunch of lookups, little ones (cache efficient)
 inoryy: but does it slay vampires?
 Marchete: I hate oware rules more than PCR sim
 Marchete: oware = you can move, yes, but then it's invalid and game is ended
 Marchete: you can sow but can't capture
 Marchete: a lot of yes but no
 MSmits: meh, i hate pcr more. But think about my boardstate and how i have 4 bits leftover for &gt;31 seed pits, think about how complicated that sim becomes :P
 Marchete: I prefer to use 128 bits for board + score
 Marchete: 64+16 vs 128
 Marchete: I don't know
 MSmits: i like to have a cache of 40 million nodes :P
 MSmits: and reuse tree, for the whole game
 Marchete: how do you reuse nodes?
 MSmits: i just check the state 
 MSmits: if it's the same as one of the children of the root, i take it as the new root
 Marchete: you don't reuse nodes, then, no?
 MSmits: yeah i do
 MSmits: thats reusing nodes
 Marchete: how do you keep track of that?
 MSmits: the root is just the pointer to one of the nodes in my cache
 Marchete: I splitted the big array of node on smaller parts
 MSmits: when i play a move, i change the root
 Marchete: like 1 per depth
 MSmits: nah, why do that
 MSmits: just make a nodes[40 million]
 MSmits: or whatever fits
 MSmits: let me share my node, sc
 MSmits: sec
 Marchete: I have like 6million nodes, without gamestate&#160;:)
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3522e412-71cc-4105-8b21-9524cedfa5c2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3522e412-71cc-4105-8b21-9524cedfa5c2</a>
 Marchete: Cache Manager. Size:347MB - 5700000 nodes splitted in 57 blocks 
 Marchete: you change turn, you search your move + enemy move
 Marchete: have a match
 Marchete: then you set that as root
 Marchete: root-&gt;parent = nullptr;
 MSmits: my nodes dont know their parents
 MSmits: they dont need to
 Marchete: how do you backpropagate?
 MSmits: Node* selectedNodes[200];
 MSmits: i store the pointer
 MSmits: during selection
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/183fb07b-3bdb-4893-8659-dca90372d5db">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/183fb07b-3bdb-4893-8659-dca90372d5db</a>
 MSmits: i dont even backpropagate
 MSmits: i forward propagate, if you mean the order in which i increment
 MSmits: it doesnt really matter as long as you do the signs correctly
 Marchete: it's a good idea
 Marchete: I know
 Marchete: but you don't "recycle" nodes,no?
 MSmits: i think you overthink the tree reuse
 MSmits: i do
 MSmits: let me show you
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d446e5e-f45d-4beb-b3ad-c11bd2a1ac09">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d446e5e-f45d-4beb-b3ad-c11bd2a1ac09</a>
 MSmits: so i check all the children of the last root, see if any correspond with the current gamestate and then i set that node as the current root
 Marchete: childMax is childCount right?
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: the current root I get it
 MSmits: oh i also change the root when i play  a move
 Marchete: but you reorder or smth?
 MSmits: so the root gets changed twice per turn
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: the nodes are just all over the cache
 dudeOnGitHub: spam
 MSmits: until its full
 MSmits: then the whole thing gets reset
 Marchete: what reset means
 Marchete: lost all infor?
 Marchete: info?
 MSmits: yes, this happens when the full object pool is used
 MSmits: you can also start at index 0 again and not reset
 MSmits: and hope it doesnt yet need nodes that have been overwritten
 MSmits: thats risky
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: that doesn't work
 Marchete: trust me
 MSmits: i used it before in uttt
 RoboStac: thats how all my mcts bots work
 MSmits: the reset happened at ply 20-30
 Marchete: without reset?
 MSmits: yeah he restarts and doesnt reset
 MSmits: as long as none of the older nodes are still in use, its fine
 MSmits: and you dont get to ply 30 on turn 1
 MSmits: so thats usually ok
 Marchete: I was splitting all nodes in different arrays of nodes
 MSmits: the faster your bot get the riskier it becomes
 Marchete: then mark the arrays unused 
 MSmits: nah dont do that
 Marchete: it works but probably slower than yours
 MSmits: for one, the gain of tree reuse is marginal
 MSmits: it helps more in games with low branching
 MSmits: in oware admittedly it helps more
 MSmits: but still, the game has branched twice since your last turn
 MSmits: think of how few visits will still be in that branch
 Marchete: between 8% and 90%
 Marchete: I got stats
 MSmits: yeah in oware it is a lot more
 Marchete: on my buggy bot
 MSmits: but in uttt its pretty crappy
 Marchete:  Visits:3130/11746 = 26%
 Alshock: un UTTT my reuse was about a few percents
 Marchete: Visits:45738/52013 = 87% --&gt; At that time I already lost&#160;:)
 RoboStac: theres still enough turns in UTTT with only 1 or 2 good moves that it makes a big difference
 MSmits: well there's also a price to pay for tree reuse, that you may not realize
 MSmits: you get cache efficiency for not reusing
 Marchete: why
 Marchete: contiguous?
 MSmits: because if you reuse, your nodes are much more spaced out
 MSmits: yes
 RoboStac: not massively, it's still going to spread out very quickly
 Marchete: then yes
 MSmits: i have no idea how strong this effect is
 MSmits: but there must be some
 Marchete: neither me, I tried the fastest reuse with low precached nodes
 MSmits: in any case, having to reset halfway through the game is no big deal
 MSmits: if it's just 1 time
 Marchete: splitting in "levels" seemed the faster to me
 MSmits: never tried this, but as i said, the smaller your nodes become, the less of an issue you have to solve
 Marchete: but probably raw power and 1 reset can be better long temr
 Marchete: term
 MSmits: there are only a few games that require a reset
 MSmits: bandas is notorious for this
 MSmits: you do so many sims, you might run out
 Kitkat260: which lang is easier to code?
 RoboStac: bandas is a pain because it has infinite cycles and always has 4 moves
 Kitkat260: ....
 MSmits: yeah, but if you use an endgame book, most of those cycles disappear
 Marchete: python3
 Kitkat260: thx
 RoboStac: yeah, but then I'd have to write an endgame book
 MSmits: yes, i thought it was fun though&#160;:)
 MSmits: got up to 3x4
 Marchete: I'm trying to do some more generic MCTS, not ultra tuned for certain game
 MSmits: darkhorse always uses the same generic mcts
 Marchete: I see the no parent interesting
 MSmits: i always end up with a different mcts, because i somehow go with the input structure
 JBM: thor keeps going off the screen
 struct: generic code is good if you want something coded fast
 JBM: this is too hard
 MSmits: sometimes you're always p1, sometimes the index is given etc
 Marchete: print -3*vel, it works fine for thor
 Marchete: you can do overloads
 Marchete: I'm trying to do that
 ZERIH08: hi
 Marchete: but for the most performance
 Marchete: it's not the best
 MSmits: btw Marchete, oware also has endgame books
 MSmits: I go up to 9 seeds comfortably, 10 seeds with some crazy workarounds
 MSmits: and they are not stored in codesize
 MSmits: so goes easily with nn&#160;:)
 Marchete: "and they are not stored in codesize"
 MSmits: nope
 Marchete: what that means?
 MSmits: 500 ms
 MSmits: for a 9 seed db
 MSmits: fully calculated
 Marchete: ahhhhh
 MSmits: also including the game turn as a variable
 MSmits: so we're talking like 10 million entries
 MSmits: it may give a different result on turn 190 than turn 180
 Marchete: but then you don't have space for MCTS nodes
 MSmits: why not, I store 1 result in 5 bit
 MSmits: -15 to +15 seeds
 MSmits: so dont need more
 Marchete: tbh I don't use endgame books at all
 Marchete: and barely any opening book
 MSmits: opening books arent that great really, unless you specifically counter a deterministic opponent and thats cheesy
 MSmits: endgame books in bandas are strong and also help in oware
 MSmits: i am doing a uttt opening book experiment now, doing cg bench test every 1 million meta mcts games
 MSmits: so about once a week
 MSmits: so far, 3 million games, no net gain
 MSmits: except for 1 guy, who it turns out, also has an opening book :P
 Marchete: I prefer to copy your openings :D
 Marchete: just clone all your moves and good to go
 MSmits: this works
 Marchete: that's cheesier :D
 MSmits: when i still had my othello counter book that always drew games against oldjohn,  you could just copy 1 game of us and play the same moves vs me, guaranteed draw
 Marchete: :thinking:
 MSmits: basically perfect play from both sides
 MSmits: but just for that specific line of play (and abount 1k other lines)
 MSmits: about
 MSmits: but as i said, i turned it off, now i am just generating the book by uct, to get rid of the guilt of this cheesy way of playing&#160;:)
 struct: All the games I ported are bookable&#160;:(
 struct: I need to move amazons from wip
 struct: I think
 Marchete: how do you tune C and FPU on MCTS, Smits?
 Marchete: I struggle with these
 MSmits: FPU?
 Marchete: first play urgency
 Marchete: visits == 0
 MSmits: C is just 1.0 usually, very rarely it's 1.2  or so
 Marchete: or do you just play any visit==0 child?
 MSmits: i havent gotten any use from fpu, i dont think i did more than 1 experiment though
 MSmits: yeah i tried random first
 MSmits: or first first
 MSmits: works the same unfortunately
 MSmits: also, if you eval all children on every expansion, then there is never a visits = 0 child
 MSmits: they all start at 1
 Jeanpier: gaaa
 MSmits: i eval all on oware, bandas, onitama, yavalath. Not on uttt though
 Marchete: I put all those in visits ==0
 MSmits: when i eval all children the children also get their own score
 MSmits: thats technically a visit
 MSmits: so it's visits = 1
 Marchete: hmm, but it's not expanded
 MSmits: no, so i expand at visits = 1
 Marchete: ah, visits==1 expansion
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw you can take this further
 MSmits: darkhorse in bandas, expands 16 children
 MSmits: so he skips a layer
 MSmits: because you have 4x4
 MSmits: i tried this, no benefit for me
 MSmits: also very messy
 Marchete: like DUCT and similar
 MSmits: yeah thats also messy
 TRAFFICCONE: hello
 MSmits: hi
 TRAFFICCONE: how are you
 MSmits: I'm good, you?
 TRAFFICCONE: good
 MSmits: great

 a.fitzy98: Hey, where do you find details on the challenge?
 MSmits: it's secret
 MSmits: so you can't prepare
 BlaiseEbuth: shhh
 MSmits: you just know it's 10 days and its a bot game
 a.fitzy98: Ohh I thought it was already released
 a.fitzy98: ok cool thanks
 MSmits: oh 11 days now
 inoryy: I mean you can still prepare by doing multis if you've never participated before
 MSmits: yeah, but dont pick the really simple multi games, contests are never that simple
 struct: You should prepare :zipper_mouth:
 MSmits: preferably pick the ones that need some pathfinding, like bfs
 Astrobytes: struct and Scarfield: Thursday sounds good for me
 struct: Same time as last time?
 MSmits: hey , what are you guys doing
 Scarfield: sure, how about asking zeno, he seemed interested?
 BlaiseEbuth: Pew pew!
 a.fitzy98: By multi do you guys mean multiplayer games? And the task is to create a bot to play the game? I have never taken part in anything like this before
 struct: Sure, the new escape is 2-6 people
 MSmits: a.fitzy98 yes
 struct: MSmits Im doing bot programming
 Uxie: I have no idea how to code or read code... where do I start? I'm looking at the easy puzzles but I have no idea what I'm reading
 a.fitzy98: bf = battlefield? Thanks btw
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 inoryy: :joy:

 MSmits: Astrobytes, do we need to explain the game to you
 MSmits: you're supposed to give *them* names
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, I like to compete 
 MSmits: mmh ok&#160;:)
 Scarfield: trying to 1up a name is acceptable
 Astrobytes: ^ see, Scarfupmanship here gets it
 Scarfield: though the rules admittedly is unwritten
 Scarfield: are*
 Astrobytes: Who needs rules. Or statements :P
 Scarfield: not ceg
 MSmits: he does
 H7: What kind of Spring Challenge 2021 contest?
 MSmits: he has a rulearray
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: H7 unknown, just that it's probably a bot game
 Astrobytes: H7: Bot programming is all we know for now
 MSmits: you'll get maybe 1 or 2 hints from a trailer, the days leading up the 6 may
 MSmits: up to
 Smelty: o . o
 struct: Can it be a optimization one?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: usually it's bot game, i dont know if they would tell us if it was optim
 MSmits: the last optim was a  weekend contest
 inoryy: you can treat bot contests as optim, don't let society limit you
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: yeah, the opponent is just another variable
 MSmits: just optimize them away
 inoryy: this is the way
 Astrobytes: The real Zen of botting.
 MSmits: hey inoryy, are you involved at all with muzero?
 MSmits: i thought it is quite cool
 inoryy: MSmits nope, not involved at all
 MSmits: ah ok. I really like how a paper gets shared with some pseudo code and then implementations pop up all over that you can just try out for yourself
 MSmits: i get turned off by all those package requireements and such, but the fact that it's accessible at all is nice
 inoryy: yeah, it's really cool to see community excited enough to re-implement it&#160;:)
 MSmits: really shows you the power of an idea. The fact that something is possible is almost enough to recreate it
 MSmits: tell someone x can be done and they will do it
 jacek: but not enough power to do it&#160;:(
 MSmits: well thats true, but you can do it on a smaller scale
 MSmits: a small environment requireing a simple network to understand
 MSmits: muzero is so special, because a muzero bot will actually sim the game in a way that's not consistent with the game rules and this may lead to better result
 MSmits: just like when you throw a ball, you dont know the exact physics calculations, but you model of physics is good enough
 MSmits: your
 Scarfield: assuming i can hit something with a ball? :p
 MSmits: yeah, sorry, i meant in general. There are exceptions
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: but it has to at least indirectly learn the rules, to play by them? i could easily win at chess if i just ignored the rules i mean
 MSmits: I think it knows the possible moves to play on the current turn
 MSmits: it gets told that
 MSmits: but it doesnt know what happens after thart
 MSmits: the model is learned concurrently with the policy and value parts of the network
 MSmits: so when it builds the tree, it will often not be entirely correct
 MSmits: some moves will be so bad, it might consider them not part of the possible set of moves
 MSmits: (or something...)
 Marchete: do you think muzero has any use on CG?
 Marchete: I think it's just for bigger environments
 MSmits: might be too complex for cg, but we've been wrong before
 MSmits: there's free implementations of muzero
 MSmits: you can download them and test for connect 4
 Marchete: I see alphazero
 MSmits: and also othello i think
 Marchete: for CG
 Marchete: but not muzero
 MSmits: i found some, let me refind sec
 Marchete: but what NN size?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/applied-data-science/how-to-build-your-own-muzero-in-python-f77d5718061a">https://medium.com/applied-data-science/how-to-build-your-own-muzero-in-python-f77d5718061a</a>
 Marchete: sometimes they have connect4, the 6x7 or whatever the standard size
 inoryy: wrt compute / power requirements you might find this paper interesting <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03113">https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03113</a>
 Marchete: and 5MB NN
 inoryy: scaling laws is pretty big topic in deep learning in general atm
 MSmits: thats cool inoryy
 jacek: could simple MLP be used instead of convnets in muzero?
 Shree007: I am new to coding game
 Shree007: How to play it
 Marchete: free paper! :D
 MSmits: dont know enough to answer that. But convnets are good because parts of your board interact with neighbours more strongly than with far away parts of the board, right?
 MSmits: so you use filters similar to what is done with images?
 MSmits: maybe i got this wrong
 <b>**Marchete looks at inoryy_</b></p><p><img src="/a/61829028497145" /> jacek: so far MLP is good for my purposes
 MSmits: well MLP should be able to do anything, but it might not do some tasks as efficiently as convnets
 inoryy: muzero isn't tied to NN architecture, though you'd probably struggle to reproduce image-based results like the Atari from pixels performance
 MSmits: so it might work well with oware
 jacek: just like alphazero i suppose then
 MSmits: convnet does not make sense to me with oware
 jacek: im using a0 like without policy anyway
 Marchete: indeed
 jacek: so maybe next step will be mujacek
 Marchete: I don't really see the benefit on CG
 MSmits: that's a jacek with no human input and no idea about the game rules
 struct: By the time I learn NN the new thing will be released
 Marchete: maybe put that muzero on a challenge, go to sleep and in 5 day you have a winning bot
 MSmits: Marchete from what i understand from the papers, muzero has similar performance to azero on games where azero has been tested
 Marchete: days*
 MSmits: the strength is in other applications
 MSmits: like, building a model of an unknown environment
 MSmits: like a robot exploring a space
 Marchete: that's what I'm trying to say
 MSmits: yeah, you're right
 Marchete: CG has strict, written rules
 Marchete: no open spaces and that
 inoryy: muzero shines as a model-based agent, e.g. where env simulation is very expensive or even impossible
 Marchete: maybe as a proof of concept
 Marchete: who knows
 jacek: well its about seeing if it works
 Marchete: I see muzero working on PCR
 Marchete: tons of chips
 MSmits: yeah might be nice
 Marchete: where "image" is important
 MSmits: or fantastic bits
 jacek: you can do perfect tic tac toe with few ifs, but if the goal is to learn minimax, you'd use minimax there
 Marchete: I learn what I can make use of it
 jacek: greedy
 Marchete: I think I can use alphazero, actor critic or similar
 Marchete: for muzero I see little use
 MSmits: in board games, yes
 Marchete: in CG restrictions
 MSmits: might be good for chaotic, hard to sim games maybe?
 MSmits: maybe meanmax&#160;?
 Marchete: I think a0 does it
 MSmits: yeah i guess so
 ShortBaited: Automaton2000 say something funny?
 Marchete: maybe better with Conv layers
 Automaton2000: but u can get to a higher league
 MSmits: I still have a nonworking smitismax for meanmax i never finished
 MSmits: the algo should work
 struct: Other player actions dont affect your possible actions?
 Smelty: o.O
 MSmits: they affect the result of your actions
 MSmits: but not your possible actions
 MSmits: like csb
 struct: I see
 MSmits: you can get pushed around but still get to use the same actions
 struct: Yeah, I thought it was like FB
 MSmits: its not 100% sure though
 MSmits: there are some effects from special abilities
 MSmits: so you make some assumptions
 Marchete: the hard part are the "spells"
 MSmits: yeah i would just allow them at depth 0
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: and not in deeper layers
 Marchete: like me
 MSmits: i do the same in csb
 struct: you do smitsi on mean max marchet?
 Marchete: I always have a different children creation
 Marchete: for turn ==0
 Marchete: no
 Marchete: only on Xmas and PCR
 MSmits: me in pcr, xmas, csb and an early version of it in kutulu
 MSmits: should improve that version one day
 MSmits: it's a C# bot with a bad eval, still got 4th&#160;:)
 Marchete: kutulu was the first one, right?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i liked your post about the yoga mats btw
 MSmits: i got the same search result
 Marchete: based on a true history
 MSmits: i was gonna say something about google thinking you're interested in yoga
 MSmits: then i did the same search and it showed me that too
 jacek:&#160;:?
 MSmits: if you google uct forest jacek
 MSmits: daporan used it in his contest win
 MSmits: it's the same as smitsimax basically, but he calls it that, which is fine. It's more descriptive
 jacek: University of Cape Town?
 MSmits: just multiple uct trees
 Marchete: that's you, jacek?
 Astrobytes:  Yeah, I kinda like the name. Descriptive as you say MSmits
 jacek: uhm

 jacek: what did you find
 ShannonNorris97: I'm just skimming to find some decent resources, but it just seems like it's own algorithm completely, so I'm not sure if I'm looking at the right thing
 jacek: well its more general for DFS search
 ShannonNorris97: Ah okay, and then it combines with the minimax algorithm in some way?
 jacek: yes, as minimax is some sort of DFS anyway

 Zenoscave: thanks Zarthie
 KiwiTae: noice
 Astrobytes: oh cool zeno, what are you doing? Minimaxing approach?
 Zenoscave: ok bye all I gotta work. Nope FSM
 Astrobytes: Ah right, thought there was something special going on :D
 Astrobytes: Laters man
 Zenoscave: Not yet&#160;:) Might sim later in Legend
 Astrobytes: Seems doable. Fiddly game it is.
 ZarthaxX: scarfo LOL
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: StarWarsPewField
 Astrobytes: PewthaxX
 Scarfield: IncomeTax
 Scarfield: copyPasteroBytes
 Astrobytes: What did I copypasta?
 Astrobytes: "IncomeTax" :rofl:
 Scarfield: nothing(?) i just got the idea for the name
 Astrobytes: It makes my teeth itch. PastaBytes I can live with
 Astrobytes: Or PastryBites
 Scarfield: PastryBites xD
 Scarfield: i wish you could give others nick names, so you would see that instead of the actual name in chat, you would be PastryBites
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Sparky610: Hi
 jacek: good evening
 AntiSquid: itchy teeth? honey comb candy&#160;?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=makes+my+teeth+itch+meaning">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=makes+my+teeth+itch+meaning</a>
 AntiSquid: well it literally made my teeth itch whenever i tried it lol
 jacek: those british teeth...
 Secret_sister2: (ノ-_-)ノ ~┻━┻
 AntiSquid: european
 Zenoscave: Damn European teeth
 Zenoscave: WFH is hard
 Astrobytes: lol, distracted much zeno
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: 30 second review from you please - Neon Genesis Evangelion
 jacek: WFH?
 AntiSquid: my first day of WFH after a while lol
 Astrobytes: working from home
 AntiSquid: working from home 
 jacek: its about puberty ~
 <b>**AntiSquid tumbleweeds and crickets</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: That good eh
 Astrobytes: Thanks. Someone recommended it.
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://images.app.goo.gl/kNtuzw6bT2rA9FrAA">https://images.app.goo.gl/kNtuzw6bT2rA9FrAA</a>
 AntiSquid: ah was replying to jacek's puberty joke, Astrobytes
 Zenoscave: just a little distracted
 Sparky610: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 jacek: joke?
 AntiSquid: as for the anime, it's some emo kid who gets bullied and for some reason has social anxiety even if not bullied, the ending kills all the story for me, they fight hard for nothing @_@ Astrobytes
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid Cruel Angel's Thesis is playing in your head now
 Zenoscave: yw
 AntiSquid: ah you replied to neon genesis evangelion jacek&#160;? sorry, thought you were refering to the WFH thing
 Astrobytes: Sounds pointless. On my don't bother list
 Zenoscave: Serial Experiments Lain is much better
 Zenoscave: ^ Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: i agree with what jack said btw, it's true, Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: i don't get the point of serial experiemnts lain ... imo better watch Stein's Gate; 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, figures. Thanks for the opinions guys, knew I could trust you all
 jacek: try boku no pico!
 Smelty: . 0 .
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: change avatar orientation so he doesn't recognize you after watching it, jacek
 Astrobytes: eh naw, you're alright thanks
 Zenoscave: jacek wtf are you mentioning piko here for
 AntiSquid: if Automaton2000 made an anime it would probably have story elements from boku no piko
 Zenoscave: we have *standards* here
 Automaton2000: how many languages do you know when i will be
 YaoKim: yo dudes if i wanna sort descending, should i use &gt; or &lt;
 jacek: isnt this anime to introduce to people who have never watched anime
 Zenoscave: depends on what is on which side of the &gt;/&lt; YaoKim
 AntiSquid: i think the moe stuff is bad enough already
 jacek: what language?
 AntiSquid: what did you watch so far Astrobytes that you liked?
 AntiSquid: and neon genesis evangelion has amazing opening for sure 
 AntiSquid: the theme song is all it has
 jacek: opening? ms would love it
 jacek: also, maybe youll find something here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ashiren">https://myanimelist.net/animelist/ashiren</a>
 AntiSquid: is that your MAL account?
 Marchete: lol
 jacek: eeyup
 AntiSquid: where's your overthetop CSS styling&#160;?
 AntiSquid: they removed mine
 jacek: the what
 Astrobytes: Nothing really other than random mecha stuff, Akira, and er the Project A-Ko series thanks to an old friend back in the day (a programmer)I'm not into it really. But good is good.
 AntiSquid: you didn't see many MAL lists did you? everyone has some outrageous flashy style added to their lists
 jacek: meh
 BlaiseEbuth: Mine was not flashy
 AntiSquid: this one is mild for example&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Cynder360">https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Cynder360</a>
 AntiSquid: (not mine)
 AntiSquid: i gave lots of 1 ratings, kids would rage at me here too if i share mine
 BlaiseEbuth: You did'nt like nothing
 jacek: i dont rate, i just save for sharing
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes watch Shokugeki no Souma and Yakitate Japan
 Zenoscave: Has anyone suggested Gurren Lagan yet.
 Zenoscave: Just to watch people shift uncomfortably
 BlaiseEbuth: Kill la kill!
 Astrobytes: Those look awful AntiSquid
 BlaiseEbuth: Food anime... Why do I feel this is a little targeted&#160;? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: i thought so too until i've watched them Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Also I was exposed to Legend of the Overfiend
 AntiSquid: haha
 Zenoscave: I'd rather play code ala mode
 struct: hard choice
 BlaiseEbuth: tentacles...
 struct: ah
 struct: You could have said that first
 AntiSquid: Mob Psycho 100 has awful graphics, but great story, so ..
 Astrobytes: Urotsukidōji vs CalM? CalM, even if I have to play it for the rest of my life.
 AntiSquid: Terra Formars has great graphics but one of the dumbest plots :D
 AntiSquid: i rated 10 that one though :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Anyway, enough of this weeb stuff.
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: woah&#160;!!! let's come up with some slurs for western cartoons too, for equality
 Astrobytes: whitey toons
 AntiSquid: Aeon Flux was great btw
 AntiSquid: ugly but good story
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think I know that, even if I didn't watch it all
 AntiSquid: Afro Samurai is about a black guy, created by jap studio and has western style to it
 AntiSquid: 10/10 
 Astrobytes: sounds odd
 JBM: 10/10=1
 JBM: yup, it's odd
 AntiSquid: lots of gore, great story imo
 Scarfield: makes me think of Beverly Hills Ninja for some reason
 Astrobytes: oh hey JBM, didn't see you for a bit. How's it going?
 JBM: same old
 JBM: maybe more bored
 AntiSquid: your avatar is also a 10/10 JBM
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I feel that
 JBM: been streaming the shit out of the inlaw's ISP
 Astrobytes: Hah, visiting time is it
 JBM: how was sf42?
 Astrobytes: was actually quite fun
 Astrobytes: Wish I'd joined earlier
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: respond to your forum tag
 struct: It was good
 struct: Just no time
 AntiSquid: trying to better prepare for contest: staring at tryangle game and switching to different tab to do something else, been doing this for a while now, it's the graphics @_@
 struct: Legend or delete?
 AntiSquid: there is no legend
 Astrobytes: Only memories.
 Astrobytes: struct: When do we get Amazons boss
 struct: no time atm
 Astrobytes: Should I make one?
 struct: Maybe after the contest
 struct: If I dont have to delete
 struct: if you want to
 Astrobytes: What kind of boss do you want? Low depth alphabeta?
 struct: Whatever beats random
 Astrobytes: Cool. Will come up with something
 struct: Thanks
 Astrobytes: No worries
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Thankfield
 Scarfield: np, didnt know of that feature, hardly ever use the forum, but nice
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's not the best forum system tbh, some things are less than obvious
 Astrobytes: It works though I guess
 struct: omg
 struct: Im stuck in a loop
 Astrobytes: A thought loop? You been at the LSD again?
 Astrobytes: (kidding ofc)
 struct: Cant answer 
 Zenoscave: When do you think a w/r is enough to ensure you'll beat the boss???
 Astrobytes: Aha. Gotcha.
 struct: 100%
 Zenoscave: 55%? 60%?
 Astrobytes: 50+ against the boss I thiiiink?
 AntiSquid: depends on the bots that are below the boss too
 Zenoscave: true Anti
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you need that certainty above anything else
 Astrobytes: Ohh on the LSD note, happy Bicycle Day
 MSmits: Zenoscave, anything that is above 50% is enough. Mathematically, you will simply promote anyone else that you have &lt;50% winrate against
 Zenoscave: Makes sense
 MSmits: but you have to actually be certain it is above 50%. 10 games in a submit means nothing
 MSmits: do a 1000 game CG bench and have it be above 53% or so
 MSmits: then you can be fairly certain
 Zenoscave: So N &gt; 100 at least?
 MSmits: depends on the margin you have
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 MSmits: if in 100 games you have 60% WR thats pretty good also
 Zenoscave: Binomial P values and what not
 MSmits: yeah, i go by gut feeling here, done enough cg bench to know to be careful
 MSmits: theres free confidence calculators though
 Astrobytes: stahp
 Zenoscave: I have a physical one too
 Zenoscave: ti-34X
 Astrobytes: It's like being in biology lectures again
 MSmits: ti-30Xa
 Zenoscave: maybe that's the one I have
 MSmits: 7Euro 99
 MSmits: when i got it
 Zenoscave: 35 USD&#160;:/
 MSmits: ripped off
 MSmits: but you might have something different
 MSmits: mine is not graphical
 MSmits: just a simple scientific calculator
 MSmits: it has sine and stuff
 AntiSquid: maybe it's import tax for the US
 MSmits: blame trump
 Zenoscave: Mine has basic stats stuff
 Astrobytes: hm, I have a TI graphical one somewhere but it needs a battery. Stuck with my 2 fx-83GT+
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i had a TI graphical one from work. It died in a few weeks cuz the batteries leaked
 MSmits: never got a new one
 AntiSquid: geez just get some software with sci calc
 MSmits: yeah, i dont need that shitty thing
 Astrobytes: fx-83GT has some stats stuff but it's quicker to do it on the computer tbh
 MSmits: you know, in my country we actually use graphical calculators on math exams
 MSmits: it's mandatory curriculum
 MSmits: i hate that, just let them use a plain calculator and draw their own graphs
 Scarfield: its a good business for calculator producers
 Astrobytes: Interesting. I was only allowed a basic non-graphing calculator without solving capabilities
 MSmits: if you want to be fancy with tools, get a laptop and use real software
 MSmits: Scarfield definitely is
 MSmits: TI designed a calculator with buttons for physics constants
 MSmits: like planck constant and stuff
 MSmits: but physics commission made it illegal to use in exams, so we dont use it&#160;:(
 MSmits: come on, who wouldnt want a light speed button
 Astrobytes: Well, you are given all constants needed during the exam usually no
 MSmits: they get a 200 page table book
 Astrobytes: But yeah, the light speed button :D
 MSmits: it's in table 7
 Scarfield: i would, if it was a read one in my car
 MSmits: but it's cooler when it's built in
 Astrobytes: True
 Marchete: "illegal to use in exams"ç
 Marchete: like you need to know constants?
 MSmits: it's too easy when they only press a button i guess
 MSmits: they want to force students to use the table book thingy
 MSmits: but I want my lightspeed button&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Sure. When I did my higher physics exam I had to actually recite the Planck length in 4 different ways
 Zenoscave: "Smol"
 Astrobytes: (I didn't)
 MSmits: the planck length is something else. Also... recite, it's not a poem i dont think :P
 Zenoscave: That's 1 way right?
 Scarfield: lol zeno
 Astrobytes: hah
 Scarfield: making a poem out of it would help with memorizing it though
 MSmits: probably, but why would anyone need the planck length
 Astrobytes: recite it's numeric representation - better MSmits?
 MSmits: dont you mean plancks constant?
 Astrobytes: I pulled it out of the air for joking reasons!
 Astrobytes: Jeez, never joke with physicists
 MSmits: ohhh ok, well i take you seriously when you go quantum
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: cuz you seem to know more than the average biologer
 Scarfield: oof
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah I do, it's true.
 Marchete: I even google how to do a loop
 MSmits: do a loop?
 Astrobytes: I'll make a more educated joke next time :P
 MSmits: quantum loop theory?
 Marchete: for loop
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: I have a perfect solution for you Marchete
 MSmits: use FP languages. No loops
 Marchete: FP?
 MSmits: functional programming
 MSmits: haskell etc
 Astrobytes: Forgettable Problems
 Marchete: haskell? ugh
 MSmits: well it's just one example
 Astrobytes: Recursion recursion recursion recursion recursion...
 MSmits: I wrote oware web app in elm&#160;:)
 MSmits: got a 10/10 for it btw!
 MSmits: maybe i mentioned that before
 MSmits: don't care :P
 MSmits: first time i am actually proud of anything i did during my studies. FP is hard to learn
 Marchete: I prefer to learn from your bots rather than elm web apps
 MSmits: sure, but this was not voluntary, i had to do it to pass the class&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Hey Marchete. How's your bot
 Marchete: average
 Marchete: it seems to win
 AntiSquid: fix it
 Zenoscave: ezpz
 Marchete: ezpz
 MSmits: Marchete is this a NN already or are you just using any old eval?
 Zenoscave: Wait which bot are we talking about
 MSmits: oware bot 
 Zenoscave: Gotcha
 Marchete: just old eval from minimax, limited to -1..1
 Astrobytes: Yes, I noticed it was improving Marchete
 MSmits: maybe you just need a better eval then though
 MSmits: it's not that easy to write a good one
 Marchete: negamax was 15th, jacek around 20th
 Astrobytes: In fact it's kinda painful
 MSmits: the top 10, maybe 15 are pretty well fitted
 Marchete: I think I have a bad simulation
 Marchete: it's hard for me to know who wins when
 MSmits: i think you underestimate the strength of the oware top players
 Marchete: I need to reuse either referee or Agad_e arena code
 MSmits: competition has been pretty fierce 
 Marchete: underestimate?
 MSmits: yeah 20th is not weak
 Astrobytes: It's a hardcore lb
 Marchete: hmm
 Marchete: 20th?
 MSmits: there's a lot of guys with similar strengths
 struct: top 20 ezpz
 MSmits: between 5 and 15
 MSmits: i think
 Marchete: I don't think 20th+ are specially powerful
 MSmits: no, i am not sure where the limit is
 Marchete: my bot is negamax + some eval
 MSmits: but top 10 is quite hard to reach
 Marchete: like I tried two evals
 Marchete: one mine and another from github
 Marchete: and picked the best
 Zenoscave: I think I finally have my C# Test-bed/Development policy ready for MAy
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's about right, maybe 5-10-11, I didn't look at scores recently
 Marchete: I'd say top 15
 MSmits: Marchete did you fit the values?
 Zenoscave: Just need gitlab Devops now
 MSmits: or did you just pick a few sets and kept the best?&gt;
 Marchete: only 2 sets
 Marchete: one mine
 Marchete: and another from internet
 MSmits: ah well that makes a big difference
 Marchete: no fitting
 Astrobytes: Going in proper Zeno&#160;:)
 MSmits: we spent weeks tuning these
 Marchete: I won't tune that
 Marchete: I'll put a NN to do the magic
 MSmits: top 10 unreachable for a normal negamax with no tuning
 Marchete: I need to tune CONSTANT_C
 Zenoscave: Yup!  
 Marchete: I don't really now how to tune it
 Zenoscave: to 440 Hz
 Marchete: and this is a problem for training
 MSmits: You don't even need to tune it if you use normal eval
 Astrobytes: C is the least of your issues
 MSmits: because you can set it to 1
 MSmits: and fit all the others
 Astrobytes: Isn't that A zeno
 Marchete: what is my issue?
 MSmits: then the C is a free parameter basically
 Zenoscave: Oh yeah, whoops
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 YurkovAS: good eval example for oware<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.joansala.com/auale/strategy/en/">http://www.joansala.com/auale/strategy/en/</a>
 MSmits: with any set of parameters, you can set one to  1 or some other value and fit the others in relation
 Marchete: I think I used that eval
 MSmits: so just set c to 1
 MSmits: I used that eval for my web app
 Astrobytes: Yes as YurkovAS says it's a good starting point
 MSmits: exactly that one
 Marchete: &lt;NNvalue[-1..1]&gt; + ConstantC * whatever
 Marchete: first is limited to -1 to 1
 MSmits: but its wayyyy weaker than my live bots eval
 Astrobytes: I can hardly read mine
 Astrobytes: It's due a full rewrite/refactoring tbh
 Zenoscave: Here's a question. How many of you try to keep coding standards and readability during a contest?
 MSmits: try is the operative word
 Astrobytes: Not as much as I do for multis
 Marchete: it's exactly that heuristic
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/joansalasoler/aalina/blob/7c7d0b27388c58b84edc2028277a71c3447329be/src/com/joansala/oware/OwareGame.java#L436-L464">https://github.com/joansalasoler/aalina/blob/7c7d0b27388c58b84edc2028277a71c3447329be/src/com/joansala/oware/OwareGame.java#L436-L464</a>
 MSmits: I *tr*
 Marchete: what I used
 MSmits: y
 Zenoscave: I even try to handle Liskov stuff too
 Zenoscave: SOLID etc.
 MSmits: how many rollouts do you get Marchete?
 Marchete: little
 MSmits: also matters a lot
 Marchete: because I need to store the gamestate
 MSmits: well i store the gamestate on the node too
 Astrobytes: DURING A CONTEST Zenoscave. I tip my hat
 Marchete: I'd say 54k sim
 MSmits: in turn 2 right?
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: lemme do a test, sec
 Zenoscave: Well I woudn't be a good TA for a class on SDLC's if I didn't Astro
 Marchete: according to visits
 MSmits: it's good to compare
 MSmits: as soon as this ide loads, slow as hell
 Astrobytes: Zeno: This is indeed, very true&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe because of the 25 kb opening book :P
 Marchete: ....
 Marchete: anyways I won't have a lot of simcount
 Astrobytes: No, the Oware IDE takes ages to open
 Marchete: I imagine the NN will take a lot of it
 MSmits: seems about 220k visits
 MSmits: but i expand all children, so thats about 4-5 visits
 MSmits: each rollout
 Marchete: I'd expect that you have like 800k or similar :D
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: 1M then
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: divide to get your result
 MSmits: so only like 50k rollouts, but i eval all so its a bit more work
 MSmits: counts as 1 visit for every pit
 MSmits: this is why iget 220k
 MSmits: so i dont think you're actually that slow
 Astrobytes: I get 60-70k
 Marchete: I'm probably counting badly
 Astrobytes: But this version expands one at a time
 MSmits: oh, that makes sense
 MSmits: my eval is also quite heavy btw, it even has loops
 MSmits: counting stuff over all pits and such
 Marchete: do you priorize capture in some way on selection?
 Astrobytes: Yeah I have a loop too
 MSmits: selection is just based on UCT Marchete
 Astrobytes: You can sure give it preference in your ewal
 Astrobytes: or your eval
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/372bfcb6-3d9c-4aa8-b801-535bea5a0fae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/372bfcb6-3d9c-4aa8-b801-535bea5a0fae</a>
 MSmits: its the same as every other bot basically
 MSmits: i always do them like this, more or less
 Marchete: what status mean?
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: seems similar
 MSmits: solved or not
 MSmits: -1 loss, 0 draw, 1 win, 2 ongoing
 Marchete: hmm  fastlogf(fastsqrtf
 Marchete: no more lookup?
 MSmits: nah, not because this is faster, but because i really hate the lookups
 MSmits: this is a few&#160;% slower
 Marchete: yeah I've had some problems
 Marchete: when I have more visits than lookup
 MSmits: i would artificially limit the rollouts to fix this
 MSmits: and i dotn want to
 MSmits: I think it might also hurt cache efficiency combined with other stuff
 MSmits: like endgame books etc. Not sure, but it would make sense to me
 MSmits: funny thing: When I went from 9 seeds to 10 seeds endgame book, my bot became worse
 MSmits: 10 seeds db is so slow that it hurt my cache efficiency, is my theory
 MSmits: i might put it back in when i write a NN
 Marchete: I'm on the edge of start training
 MSmits: NN does so few rollouts that the lookups dont hurt
 Marchete: like it seems it's working
 MSmits: nice one
 Marchete: but I don't feel confident at all about it
 MSmits: you've got stiff competition in the NN department also
 MSmits: several different approaches
 Astrobytes: ^
 Marchete: not really
 Marchete: I mean
 Astrobytes: They're tough cookies
 Marchete: I play solo
 MSmits: not to mention nearly perfect play, so it's all down to 1 bad move out of 100 and you lose
 Marchete: like I usually choose multis with low activity
 Marchete: I'm trying to learn
 MSmits: yeah its good for that
 Astrobytes: I think we've noticed that Marchete&#160;:)
 Marchete: and eventually put it some skeleton on github
 Marchete: but not a ready to play bot
 MSmits: just try not to judge too much by the top 5 strength, it's all really very deterministic
 Marchete: don't worry
 MSmits: except ja cek
 MSmits: his bot is great
 Astrobytes: And be confident, just get on with it
 MSmits: it's all over the place and it's still strong
 Marchete: I haaaate oware
 Marchete: the whole simulation
 Marchete: so I'm not for top 4
 Marchete: or nothing
 MSmits: I dont mind it, it's a bit finnicky
 Marchete: just a working NN bot
 MSmits: not sure finnicky is a word
 MSmits: but it fits
 Astrobytes: I thought it was really easy simulation, one or two tricky bits
 Astrobytes: It is MSmits
 MSmits: good
 MSmits: there's more than one or two
 MSmits: my sim has 4 tricky bits
 Astrobytes: Might have one n, I've always used 2
 MSmits: the first 60 were easy
 Astrobytes: Yeah but you bitboarded it
 Marchete: wtf is that
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MaximeCheramy/cg-oware/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L223-L230">https://github.com/MaximeCheramy/cg-oware/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L223-L230</a>
 MSmits: oh right, probably wasnt necessary to bb it
 MSmits: since you also got a good simcount
 Marchete: like you have an endgame before sim?
 MSmits: I guess so
 Astrobytes: If you can't move
 Marchete: why does it takes all?
 Marchete: if you can't move?
 MSmits: it gets complicated when the last move at 200 does this
 MSmits: do you get the seeds or not?
 Marchete: it makes no sense at all
 Astrobytes: That's the tricky bit
 Marchete: and grand slam
 Marchete: it's just tricky
 MSmits: yeah it is Marchete
 MSmits: tbh i dont even know if mine does everything perfectly
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's kindof annoying to write but once it's done - it never needs to be touched again&#160;:)
 Marchete: oware? I agree :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: it's really the perfect game to practice nn's with once you do have the sim though
 Marchete: that's why I'm here
 Marchete: but I'm not sure about sim
 Marchete: even the damn score is tricky
 MSmits: ah well my sim is unintelligible, so i cant really help you
 MSmits: if unintelligible is a word 
 Astrobytes: it is
 MSmits: good
 Marchete: un intelligible, two words :P
 struct: I cant understand
 Astrobytes: not in English :D
 struct: If I change a static variable
 struct: It doesnt show what it wants...
 Marchete: I know
 struct: I tried with a local variable and it worked
 MSmits: again, try FP, no variables
 Astrobytes: only immutable thingies
 Marchete: haskell is the PCR/oware of languages
 MSmits: yeah, it's mental
 struct: Anyone has any idea why?
 MSmits: eh, if you're starting to wonder what your variables really want, then you might need a break
 Astrobytes: Hah! I think Haskell is quite elegant.I am by no means what I'd consider proficient but it's pretty cool
 Astrobytes: "It doesnt show what it wants..." What you want or what the variable wants? 
 Astrobytes: struct
 MSmits: the resilience of a program coded in FP is amazing.
 Marchete: yeah, if you know how to use it Haskell must be cool
 struct: I think I know why
 struct: I had a static array
 Marchete: for non-FP
 Marchete: it's hard
 struct: That I was writing over his index
 MSmits: tell me about it
 struct: his max index
 Astrobytes: Yeah I am very far from an FP expert
 MSmits: for the first 2 sets of home work it took me almost a full day and was just as slow as the other students
 MSmits: then you get used to it
 MSmits: and you suddenly get to use all your coding skills again
 struct: MSmits when can we expect a Yavalath paper?
 MSmits: damn, there is so much to write up&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Well, when you have the time
 MSmits: maybe I should just not try to come up with new stuff for a while and just do the things Marchete comes up with
 Marchete: ok, smits says a C=1.0
 Marchete: and these guys
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-3-parameter-tweaking-4dceb78ed1e5">https://medium.com/oracledevs/lessons-from-alphazero-part-3-parameter-tweaking-4dceb78ed1e5</a>
 MSmits: then i have time to write up what i have
 Marchete: put C=4.0 
 struct: Nah, you dont have to, I was just wondering, since you talked about it before.
 MSmits: yes but Marchete, the C param is only meaninful in relation to your range of score
 Marchete: range -1 to 1
 Marchete: tanh
 MSmits: even so, you have a st.dev, if your scores are in practice all between -0,02 and +0,02, it's different
 MSmits: so you need to fit it
 Marchete: I won't know how the NN will behave
 MSmits: it is just 1 more param
 Astrobytes: It's empirical MArchete
 MSmits: I use 1.0 for two things
 MSmits: when it's a loss/win thing like in uttt it is a good value
 MSmits: so -1 to 1
 MSmits: but also when i have all my eval params fitted in relation to c and i keep c at 1
 MSmits: i did that in csb
 MSmits: so my distance params are all super small
 MSmits: 0.000001 and such
 MSmits: in a nn it is going to be different
 Marchete: I remember to reuse my ranges from xmas to PCR and they worked well
 Marchete: like it's important to keep a good relationship
 MSmits: yeah, you can always double your c and double all your eval params and you get the same bot 
 MSmits: it's all in relation 
 Astrobytes: Yes, as long as it's related
 Marchete: ok, then I'd need to factor the NN output
 Astrobytes: ah beat me again smits
 Marchete: or adjust C
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: thats it
 MSmits: i would not worry so much about c
 MSmits: if you pick it too low, all your nodes have the same visits
 MSmits: no wait
 MSmits: too high
 MSmits: otherwise you will have 1 node with all visits, then c is too low
 MSmits: somewhere between those two is ok
 MSmits: worry about it when the nn starts getting better
 Zenoscave: between all and neglible is ok
 Marchete: I need to cache gamestates
 Marchete: then I'll try to train
 YurkovAS: Marchete i'm checked your eval function: 13-15 place with mcts ept depth 4, no solver, 25-30k rollouts second turn.
 MSmits: at first i usually do a few tests in te ide, and if i see 100 visits, 100 visits 1000 visits 5k etc. It seems ok
 Marchete: thanks yurkov
 Marchete: then I need to improve the MCTS part
 Marchete: negamax went like 15th with that
 MSmits: i forgot to mention Marchete
 Marchete: but my jacekmax won't go above 20th
 MSmits: negamax did not do well on oware
 MSmits: compared to mcts and similar
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix your MCTS and go legend Marchete
 Marchete: ezpz
 MSmits: also Marchete, how come we dont hear from you for like a year and then you suddenly share all that brilliant stuff with us
 Marchete: 30k rollouts is a lot
 MSmits: first that NS monster and then that NN thigny
 Marchete: I got tired and take some rest
 MSmits: well it helped
 Marchete: the NN is from months ago
 Astrobytes: eh, my negamax was alright, my mcts+ept was way better. Doesn't tric still use ab nega?
 Zenoscave: I think many of us needed a break for CG. I definitely did
 MSmits: but thats tric
 Marchete: NS was because xevi xevi got 700 with LAHC
 MSmits: he is magical with that
 Marchete: and I said wth
 Astrobytes: It's not magic, I even got some tips from him after I helped him promote in Clobber
 Marchete: in fact it was this kind of lucky shots
 Marchete: after many trials
 MSmits: well it's good to have you back again anyways
 Marchete: with 12hrs solving time using 70vCPUs...
 Marchete: I stalked a lot
 Marchete: :eyes:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you used to pop up randomly at late European hours&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It is good to see you back
 Astrobytes: (and all the other ones that seem to have returned)
 Astrobytes: Why doesn't recar talk? I always see him online
 Marchete: maybe in ru?
 Astrobytes: hm, I don't spend much time in there, I always end up closing the chat window due to pms
 Marchete: I have zero pm, but I didn't chat a lot because I haven't anything interesting to say
 Marchete: except for NS, that I thought it was cool
 Zenoscave: NS?
 Marchete: number shifting
 Zenoscave: negascout?
 Zenoscave: ah.
 Astrobytes: On the contrary Marchete, you clearly have lots of interesting things to say&#160;:)
 MadKnight: #ru wants me to ban this guy who's been there for some time because he keeps spamming all kinds of random thoughts and his small updates for his coding project to the point where the entire chat is mostly filled with his junk, but for some reason i feel guilty.....
 Marchete: I just wanted to reach 999 when the toad was online
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 how do i fix me?
 Automaton2000: i got to silver in uttt
 Marchete: thx
 struct: I also spam random thoughts
 Marchete: so I just submitted when he was online and replying me :D
 Marchete: damn toad and his damn puzzles
 Zenoscave: I interject most of the time.
 struct: Im just not spamming as much because I can't :zipper_mouth:
 MadKnight: no struct it's so much worse with this guy
 MadKnight: to the point where u get used to ignoring his messages by reflexes just like recus ignores Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: in the pod racing game
 Zenoscave: lol Which one Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: can i change my mind
 Astrobytes: struct you always post your random thoughts
 MadKnight: i mean i talked to this guy today and i felt like i got used to just ignoring what he says in such a short amount of time
 struct: This time I cant
 Marchete: me?
 struct: its hard
 Astrobytes: Ah right, ofc
 Marchete:&#160;:*
 Marchete: I'm going to sleep anyways, gn
 Astrobytes: ConstantBolzmann MadKnight?
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn Marchete
 MSmits: gn, me too Marchete
 MadKnight: ye, u gonna ban him right now?
 MadKnight: lol
 Astrobytes: Think I'm on my way too
 struct: gn everyone
 Astrobytes: gn all
 BlaiseEbuth: Giant Noodle
 Astrobytes: Tentacle
 Astrobytes: bn satan :P
 Marchete: is oware solved?
 Astrobytes: not the abapa version
 Astrobytes: It's complicated, ask again tomorrow
 BlaiseEbuth: Big Noodle&#160;?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MadKnight: wait who didn't go to sleep&#160;?
 RomanceDawn: you
 MrFruit: slep god
 MadKnight: RomanceDawn well so since u are a dawn...
 MadKnight: RomanceDawn what is your pair of words supposed to mean&#160;?
 RomanceDawn: its
 RomanceDawn: "the beging of a great journey " 
 RomanceDawn: its the title  of the first chapter of ONE PIECE 
 MadKnight: oooh like a dawn of a great romance?
 RomanceDawn: yeah yeah 
 MadKnight: dammit Automaton2000 i almost spelled "damn" instead of - dawn
 Automaton2000: wish i had a few bugs
 MadKnight: RomanceDammit
 RomanceDawn: :grin:
 MadKnight: everything must have an end RomanceDawn
 MadKnight: so looking forward for the Dusk version
 RomanceDawn: romanceDusk
 MadKnight: Tusk
 RomanceDawn: maybe the very last chapter of one piece 
 MadKnight: expecting it to be dark and ambient
 MadKnight: i only like that stuff
 MadKnight: not depressing
 MadKnight: don't get those confused
 RomanceDawn: gn mk 
 MadKnight: RomanceDawnWhenItsDusk
 MadKnight: going to sleep until the dawn
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 pls stop
 Automaton2000: i don't see the point in the game
 Zenoscave:                 Anid    GW=50.00%  [36.34% ,63.66% ] [W=50.00%  L=50.00%  D=0.00%  ] [56]
 Zenoscave: whoops sorry, thought that would pastebin
 struct: which game Zenoscave?
 Zenoscave: c4l
 Zenoscave: I win exactly half my matches in against the next top players and the boss. I'm not sure if I should submit or wait
 struct: you wont get pushed anytime soon
 Zenoscave: true
 Zenoscave: I'll tweak some params to match boss w/r and hope
 MadKnight: Zenoscave pastebins are more than 4 lines of textg
 MadKnight: u only had 4 lines
 MadKnight: just remember that criteria
 Zenoscave: Got it. thanks MK
 MadKnight: Zenoscave anyway, what game is that&#160;?
 Zenoscave: Code4Life
 MadKnight: and what is this data&#160;?
 Zenoscave: CG Benchmark
 Zenoscave: Of my local bot
 MadKnight: ooooh i need to re-solve this game
 Zenoscave: You're wood still, yeah?
 MadKnight: was almost legend during contest
 MadKnight: i think it was my first contest where i couldn't reach legend
 MadKnight: was sad
 Zenoscave: WEPWEPWEP
 MadKnight: need to reach legend everywhere now
 kkkkl: gello
 human37: your mom lol
 jcrepes: my shirt do this
 Upthea[n]ttic: that is my mom lol
 MadKnight: guys guys calm down
 MadKnight: this guy got a special channel for u guys
 MadKnight: join it -&gt; #hismom
 MadKnight: struct are u working on any multi right now&#160;?
 struct: yes
 MadKnight: oh, which one&#160;?
 struct: csb, im rewrinting my code
 struct: Im doing avx for collisions
 struct: instead of having 8x games with avx
 MadKnight: oh i still need to make a super fancy template class that supports AVX natively
 OBenjOne: if I want to output for debugging how to I stop the game from recognizing my print statement as a command to move? 
 OBenjOne: In Coders strike back*
 struct: you print to stderr
 struct: which language are you using?
 OBenjOne: Python 3
 Zenoscave: print(..., file=sys.stderr)
 MadKnight: there's a comment telling u how to do that
 Zenoscave: make sure you import sys
 struct: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 MadKnight: u can find it
 OBenjOne: where do I find that file to read it?
 MadKnight: it's like a few lines abobe the main print()
 Zenoscave: file just means where is it printing to
 MadKnight: in a comment
 MadKnight: it goes like
 MadKnight: 
 MadKnight: don't worry
 MadKnight: oh and some interesting info struct
 MadKnight: so in c# there's actually a way to run scripts while the code is being parsed so that u would be getting raw tokens from the code
 OBenjOne: hmmm maybe I should learn c++ then
 MadKnight: and with all the cool c# features, u would be able to really beautify your c++ code by turning it in fancy c# code which just generates c++ 
 MadKnight: OBenjOne wait why?
 OBenjOne: Well it seems like just knowing python isn't quite enough in the real world
 Zenoscave: Depends on what area you work in OBenjOne
 MadKnight: it all depends on the kind of field u wanna work in
 MadKnight: fancy maths or rocket science? well c++
 MadKnight: some scripts for a server? well python
 Zenoscave: Or Typescript
 MadKnight: Zenoscript
 Zenoscave: or Javascript. Or Java, or C#. There's tons of tools to use (A language is a tool) There's no "one tool to rule them all"
 Zenoscave: just gotta learn what you like best and what's best for the job
 OBenjOne: I don't exactly know what area I want to go into yet, and I think learning a variety of languages can't hurt
 Zenoscave: ^ exactly
 Zenoscave: but not Gloss over. Actually *learn* each one fairly well first
 MadKnight: well just start with python and then switch to c#
 MadKnight: that would be pretty much enough
 OBenjOne: Ok thanks for the advice
 MadKnight: c# is actually getting popular
 Zenoscave: :thumbs_up:

 Zenoscave: Looks possible worthwhile to submit?
 Smelty: woAh 0-0
 mybk: hello everybody, I was wondering, do you think CG profile is a good reference for recruiters to evaluate the candidate&#160;? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Anyone set to receive professional emails ever get one?  i would say, drop a linkedin or a github in there.  *shrug*
 MadKnight: my headphones driver stopped working for some reason
 MadKnight: but not entirely
 MadKnight: only the part controlling the mic
 MadKnight: now the mic gives me raw sound without background sounds cleared
 MadKnight: so now any soft and distant sound sounds very loud and i can't get them to stop going back to the headphones without turning down the mic entirely
 Westicles: I suspect Russian hackers
 MadKnight: dude i'm a russian
 MadKnight: are u saying i'm such a bad russian i can't protect myself from russian hackers?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop getting triggered
 Automaton2000: that's a great way to learn more about the game
 MadKnight: anyway Westicles
 Westicles: I don't want to point fingers, but policemen usually suspect the victim
 MadKnight: what's time now for u&#160;?
 Westicles: Early evening
 cViper971: how do i rank up in coders strike back
 cViper971: im in first and ive beat the boss in the arena
 cViper971: but im not ranking up
 OBenjOne: It ranks you up after youve been ahead of the boss for a while
 cViper971: ok
 cViper971: do i need to stay in arena&gt;
 OBenjOne: At a certain time of day I think
 OBenjOne: I dont actually know Im new too
 cViper971: i can leave arena tho, right?
 OBenjOne: My pod moved up In rank while I was coding a new one
 OBenjOne: Quick question to anyone who's high rank in coders strike back: do you eventually get a current speed variable or should I code one myself by comparing distance and time? 
 Zenoscave: It changes the inputs later OBenjOne
 OBenjOne: ok thanks then I won't waste time on that now
 cViper971: anyone know when exactly it promotes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow Astrobytes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/541737806">https://www.codingame.com/replay/541737806</a>
 Zenoscave: usually once an hour
 cViper971: also how am i in first when i only did what the thing said
 mybk: it should be displayed on top (I think)
 OBenjOne: It gets harder
 cViper971: like how come no one else out of thousands in my league can beat the boss
 mybk: 1 hour to get from silver to gold league
 cViper971: im in wood 1 
 cViper971: rn
 mybk: isn't 5min or so 
 cViper971: idk why not being promoted then
 mybk: I don't really remember 
 Zenoscave: cViper971 did you beat the boss?
 cViper971: my first 2 promotions were like right after i beat boss
 cViper971: now this one is taking some time
 cViper971: yeah zeno
 cViper971: in arena
 Zenoscave: The wood leagues go faster
 cViper971: the first 2 wood were like a minute
 cViper971: this one is taking very long tho
 Zenoscave: *Much* faster
 cViper971: idk whats going on im still first
 cViper971: been so for over 10 mins\
 Zenoscave: It<i>ll be about an hour</i>
 Zenoscave: should be a timer at the top if you refresh
 cViper971: oooooooooof
 cViper971: where
 Zenoscave: what game
 cViper971: coders strike back'
 cViper971: the pod racing one
 Zenoscave: you're still doing matches
 Zenoscave: Your matches have to complete as well
 Zenoscave: you're at 23%
 Zenoscave: The timer will show up if you're above boss after all matches are done
 cViper971: how do i see the matches i need to do
 Zenoscave: click last battles
 cViper971: ohh i see it
 Zenoscave: it'll say a battles in progress and a&#160;%
 cViper971: thx
 Zenoscave: yw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Night of war is so wierd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 9th with a depth 1 eval
 PatrickMcGinnisII: scared to up the depth
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Anyone know how to track time per move for c++? I am using the high_resolution_clock but it seems off by a bit
 Westicles: #include &lt;chrono&gt;
 Westicles: You can see it used here
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/collisions-in-fantastic-bits/2369/2">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/collisions-in-fantastic-bits/2369/2</a>
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I am new to C++ and that looks crazy lol
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Not sure if it is a glitch but it seems like the bot is timing out even though it is taking less than the time limit
 Westicles: Yeah, sometimes you have to lower the limit until that goes away
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: is that a thing that happens? or is my bot just dodgy
 Westicles: I think last contest people had to set limits to 35ms intead of 50 to get it to work.  But you might also have a bug, of course
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok, I think it is probably both lol. I have to set to like 10ms
 Smelty: o  .  o
 cViper971: how do you make the best turns in coders strike back
 cViper971: rn i have it if over 90 degrees thrust 0
 cViper971: otherwise thrust 100
 cViper971: but i was thinking having thrust = constant/degrees might be better
 cViper971: its hard to tell tho
 MadKnight:  cViper971 still there&#160;?
 Smelty: wait how do we "solve" chess
 Smelty: the weekly puzzle
 davilla: write a program that never loses

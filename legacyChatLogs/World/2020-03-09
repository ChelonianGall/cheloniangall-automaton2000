 CredibleOpossum: Why is the "Power of Thor" killbox bad?
 MSmits: morning
 YurkovAS: MSmits congratulations with top1 in oware!
 MSmits: thanks
 uop: shut network
 TranBac: LOL
 MadKnight: hey MSmits u got #1&#160;?
 MadKnight: using smitsimax&#160;?
 MSmits: no, using mcts with early playout termination
 MSmits: also the nr 1 is unstable. royale can slowly pull me down with submit spam because i get occasional losses and Robo does nor
 MSmits: my bot is somewhat stronger against the nn's, but the nn's lose less vs weaker players
 ThunderbirdOne: so, technically you got lucky with the #1 spot? :p
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits</a>
 MSmits: I win almost every game against the non-NNs
 MSmits: but even if i lose 1 out of 20, if the NN's lose 1 out of 50, lower ranked players will eventually pull me down
 MSmits: so it's mostly a feature of the ladder-system. All I have to do is resubmit
 ThunderbirdOne: aha
 MSmits: it might be that the NN's take into account more different board layouts due to their training
 MSmits: which makes them more flexible vs weaker players. Less chance of a critical mistake
 MSmits: after all, I have no more than 10 parameters. And they have thousands
 ThunderbirdOne: fair enough
 wlesavo: hey guys, im probably stupid or smth, but what means {int} in python, for ex in this solution <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/skynet-revolution-episode-2/solution?id=3116375">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/skynet-revolution-episode-2/solution?id=3116375</a>
 asd521: ummm can someone help me?
 asd521: with c language i mean its a simple question
 ThunderbirdOne: wlesavo i can't see the python solutions =/
 ThunderbirdOne: asd521 shoot, someone might be able to help
 StickyVicky: wlesavo, I can't see the solution as I haven't completed but it's probably the name of an int variable that is going to be combined with text on an f-string. Such as: int=4;print(f"{int}2")
 asd521: my array has 7 elements in it but when i do sizeof(array)/sizeof(array[0]) its prints the size as 2
 ThunderbirdOne: StickyVicky seems like it, but jezus... int as a variable name :p that should be banned
 asd521: sizeof(array) prints out 8 when it should print atleast 28
 StickyVicky: still better and more descriptive than: asdf, but I agree :p 
 ThunderbirdOne: :D hah
 asd521: how can i make it more descriptive?
 ThunderbirdOne: call it whatever it represents
 ThunderbirdOne: if it's a count, call it count
 ThunderbirdOne: if it's the amount of money, call it TotalMoney or AmountOfMoney
 ThunderbirdOne: with lowercase btw, sorry :p
 MSmits: dont call it coun
 MSmits: count
 MSmits: thats a reserved word
 ThunderbirdOne: not in C#
 MSmits: true
 ThunderbirdOne: just make your variables as descriptive as possilbe, while avoiding reserved words (oh, and don't make them SUPER fucking long either)
 MSmits: sigh, I am having a checkerbot problem. My bot works, except when I turn optimization (O) on
 MSmits: how do you debug problems that only happen with optimizations?
 ThunderbirdOne: doesn't sound very optimised :p
 MSmits: you get no error message =/
 MSmits: I had this sort of thing before. It's a really tough problem
 MSmits: somewhere the optimization assumes something is always zero when it's not. 
 MSmits: or something like that
 MSmits: then it removes some code that breaks the bot
 MSmits: I also already know it's related to hashing
 darkhorse64: print is your friend. Check uninitialized data
 MSmits: i tried print, but it happens to rarely, i dont know the conditions for the print
 MSmits: uininitialized might be it iyes
 MSmits: basically it happens when i try to use transpositions and stop selection when reaching a repeated state
 MSmits: (repeated state = backprop value 0)
 MSmits: you could also do this for oware btw, but I am not currently doing that
 darkhorse64: You can also debug Release code but it assumes that you can reproduce the bug under Windows
 MSmits: also  a bit risky due to end game turn
 MSmits: my VS doesnt even know the pragmas
 MSmits: so no luck there
 Astrobytes: #ifndef _WIN32
 Astrobytes: then pragmas, so VS ignores them
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b2ca825c-b0cb-4ced-95d3-831bab342c2a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b2ca825c-b0cb-4ced-95d3-831bab342c2a</a>
 MSmits: i should put the pragmas in there too i guess
 MSmits: but it runs anyway
 MSmits: the problem is more that the bug only happens with the pragmas on
 MSmits: and they cant be on in VS
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 MSmits: but maybe VS has its own optims that cause the same bug, so i could still do it with release debugging
 MSmits: my c++ programs compiled with VS are also fast. About 30% faster than on CG due to faster processor i guess
 dbdr: MSmits: it seems quite a waste of time to search for such bugs, doesn't it?
 MSmits: yes
 dbdr: the compiler should tell you where you use uninitialized memory
 dbdr: or other undefined behaviour
 MSmits: oh, i can find that easily myself
 MSmits: the unitialized memory that is
 MSmits: undefined behavior... not so much
 MSmits: I am guessing I am copying a 32 bit to a 64 bit variable or something
 Locinsh: ]\
 MSmits: you're pushing Robo darkhorse64 :P
 dbdr: I like rust's approach, which is that such possibly undefined behaviour is reported by the compiler by default
 MSmits: thats what I knew would happen. I'm not going to resubmit soon though. I want to do some more fitting first
 dbdr: you can use the unsafe keyword if you really need sth like that and are sure it's OK
 dbdr: so you immediately know where to look if something is going wrong
 MSmits: i have to use unitialized memory often
 MSmits: try to use a 40 million sized node pool without it
 dbdr: there might be tools that help with C++, not familiar with it
 dbdr: yes, there are always ways to do that in rust as well
 MSmits: not in C#&#160;:(
 MSmits: well maybe with unsafe, i dont know
 MSmits: never used it in C#
 dbdr: it's just safe by default, unsafe when you really need it and are sure
 TheAceOfToasters: That one CodinGame Sponsored Contest where they gave you like 10 inputs, but never told you what any of them did and told you to get the highest score is the weirdest contest
 darkhorse64: I wonder how you manage to do Rust on CG with debug on in the IDE
 mr.x: hi
 darkhorse64: 0.07 away from Agade, should I resubmit&#160;? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 MSmits: no need, someone else will perturb it
 dbdr: darkhorse64: debug in the IDE is annoying but it's not a dealbreaker
 dbdr: it's good enough for testing the code is correct, usually
 darkhorse64: Your BT bot times out for instance.
 dbdr: then I look at arena matches
 dbdr: and reproduce a situation locally if I need to
 darkhorse64: Agreed but it's not very friendly
 dbdr: agreed, would be nice if CG improved it. even -O1
 dbdr: anyways, the language makes it worth it for me&#160;:)
 CSharp_Sama: Okay
 CSharp_Sama: Cool
 reCurse: #pragma...
 reCurse: Oh C#, nevermind
 Xx_R6PGMMater2BE_xX: hi guy
 Xx_R6PGMMater2BE_xX: s
 Xx_R6PGMMasterBE_xX: hello
 MSmits: did you use external things like opening books from other sources? Or fancy eval from somewhere? 
 Marchete: you need a good eval then
 Marchete: I need to
 Marchete: maybe that's the main diff from the first 2
 MSmits: opening books are easy to get
 Marchete: they are?
 MSmits: i couldnt find much actual source code of the best checkers bot. Those arent free 
 MSmits: yeah, just google a bit
 MSmits: there's whole libraries
 Marchete: I saw some openings
 Marchete: but then I need to encode, make space, etc etcv
 Marchete: the 100kb is a sh*t
 Marchete: too cumbersome
 MSmits: not true really
 MSmits: my yavalath both uses 5k
 MSmits: uttt also around that
 MSmits: it takes a huge amount of time to compute a book large enough to fill 100kb
 MSmits: oh also, that 5k is poorly compressed
 Marchete: either that or picking already done books
 Marchete: but then you realize they can't fit
 MSmits: yeah you have to get creative with that
 MSmits: probably write a program to analyze the book and make a selection
 darkhorse64: MSmits: If you are using eval after expansion, do you keep counting eval &gt; 0 as Win or do you use the true value to compute a reward or node priors&#160;?
 MSmits: I do this differently now darkhorse64, I will explain when i get home. My train is arriving now
 MSmits: will be 20 mins or so
 MSmits: maybe less
 darkhorse64: Time to go back home, too. Don't rush&#160;!
 MSmits: i'll jump over cars and sht
 Marchete: avoid coughing people too
 Marchete: people in public transport are expert on are experts in sneezing into your face
 Marchete: lol what I wrote
 Marchete: I need vacations
 MSmits: back
 MSmits: 11 mins, not bad
 MSmits: you still here darkhorse64?
 MSmits: we'll talk later. I'm guessing you're not as good as I am at jumping cars
 MSmits: it's a skill
 dbdr: MSmits, what do you mean too lazy to code the sim? You need it to update the state in any case.
 MSmits: the sim in the random rollout
 MSmits: it's different
 dbdr: So it's only picking random moves that you miss?
 MSmits: when you're using all sorts of fancy things to generate a move list for a tree, you use different code than when you're just picking 1 move
 dbdr: I mean it's a few lines of code, no?
 dbdr: pick a move, apply it
 dbdr: I see
 MSmits: ok for example, with checkers, do you pick a random piece and then a random move?
 MSmits: or do you make a full list of all moves and random that
 MSmits: it requires more thinking and since my bot isnt even working properly yet, I didnt bother
 dbdr: right, fair enough
 MSmits: i did think of one thing though
 eulerscheZahl: in checkers you have to capture whenever possible
 dbdr: my intuition would be random among all moves is better
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to consider all pieces, not just a random one
 dbdr: but might be slower
 Marchete: move ordering
 MSmits: you can do the quiescence by calculating jumps first. You only stop the sim once no more jumps are available
 Marchete: capture, anticapture, then others
 Marchete: no?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I meant, when you split the sim into two phases, jump  phase first, then move phase
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl is alive&#160;:)
 MSmits: if jumps dont happen, then there is a move phase
 MSmits: but either way you can go full random, or random piece -&gt; random move
 eulerscheZahl: why should i be dead?
 MSmits: you have been online less
 eulerscheZahl: congrats on 500 btw
 dbdr: disappeared for a while no?
 Marchete: AutomatonNN , eulerscheZahl is alive!
 AutomatonNN: why do you think it will be a random search?
 MSmits: dont scare euler away again Marchete
 eulerscheZahl: started bulls and cows today
 MSmits: oh cool, i was a great fan of that game when i was young
 eulerscheZahl: seems easy to hardcode, but playing for real is more fun
 Marchete: easy to hardcode?
 dbdr: playing for real?
 eulerscheZahl: with multiple submits to etract some info about validators
 Marchete: I mean, I tried hardcoding 1 digit
 dbdr: validators are random
 Marchete: and all values failed at first attempt
 eulerscheZahl: oh, didn't know
 Marchete: I assume validators are random
 eulerscheZahl: that explains the huge variance on submitsi thought it's just my random solver
 Marchete: at least my solution wasn't hardcoded
 Marchete: nor preseeded or anything
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: lot of variance due to this
 MSmits: but how did beard get nr 1?
 MSmits: does anyone know yet?
 eulerscheZahl: bug
 dbdr: what bug?
 eulerscheZahl: 10 validators at first, no proper leaderboard reset
 dbdr: ah yes
 Marchete: really?
 Marchete: :D
 MSmits: how are they fixing thaT?
 eulerscheZahl: BeardedWhaleYesterday at 8:30 PMThe leaderboard for Bulls and Cows 2 is still not correct. I'm in the lead with the score of 122, which I got when there were only 10 validators.AstroshytesYesterday at 8:49 PMThat answers that question at least :stuck_out_tongue:
 MSmits: ah lol
 Marchete: people got mad about he knew the random seed or smth
 MSmits: haha yes, that went off the rails  Iguess
 Marchete: I'm against mid game changes, even for NS
 MSmits: it;s not even a very good score for 10 validators is it?
 Marchete: like 12 moves per validator
 Marchete: not really I think
 dbdr: how many vals are there now?
 eulerscheZahl: 46
 eulerscheZahl: 1 digit only once, rest 5 times
 eulerscheZahl: before it was each once (1 digit to 10 ditigs)
 dbdr: damn, missed the obvious 42 choice
 MSmits: 1 digit... you need on average 5 guesses then?
 Marchete: yes
 dbdr: 1 digit =&gt; pure luck, right?
 MSmits: the information is useless
 MSmits: the input
 MSmits: yeah pure luck i suppose
 MSmits: but the validator still has a use. It tests whether your bot can deal with this length
 eulerscheZahl: similar with 9 digits
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know the missing digit
 eulerscheZahl: and more CPU time would definitely help my solver
 Marchete: I had problems on 9 and 10 too
 eulerscheZahl: so i combined 2 approaches now
 eulerscheZahl: for me it starts at 8 digits already
 Marchete: but it seems my score is not completely random, a lot of submits are around 320-340
 dbdr: but validators have only 1 and 5?
 eulerscheZahl: 1 digit once2..10 digits 5 times each
 dbdr: got it now&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439234017">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439234017</a>and that's my solver bruteforcing the right one
 eulerscheZahl: for more digits it's significantly less effective
 dbdr: oh, the replay shows the secret
 dbdr: step 1, write an OCR
 eulerscheZahl: that's not how it works :P
 dbdr: step 2: guess the correct number in 2
 dbdr: really? /s
 dbdr: that would also make things especially easy if validators were fixed
 eulerscheZahl: btw i can no longer download validators, CG blocked that API
 eulerscheZahl: it just returns "success" without any content
 MSmits: is it ever beneficial to take a guess that you know can't be the right code, but will give you more information?
 Marchete: that's a good thing euler
 eulerscheZahl: yes MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439234561">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/439234561</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's actually a bad solution
 MSmits: do you just monte carlo the possible secrets and calculate how many turns it takes to guess them&#160;?
 dbdr: depends how you define beneficial
 MSmits: guess the code sooner
 MSmits: = beneficial
 eulerscheZahl: if i take 2 digits that i haven't tested before, it might be faster
 MSmits: sooner as in, expected number of turns required
 dbdr: still not defined. in average? in the best case? worst case?
 eulerscheZahl: average i would say
 MSmits: expectation value
 MSmits: that's average I guess
 Marchete: people have studied bulls and cows, and got even formulas to get the max amount of moves and such
 dbdr: with that definition the answer is yes
 eulerscheZahl: i have a list of all possible solutions, print one at random and eliminate based on the result
 eulerscheZahl: but for 8+ digits it's too slow&#160;:(
 MSmits: however, with multiple submits possible, you may be more interested in what gives you the highest value, when you incorporate luck
 dbdr: exactly
 Marchete: euler for 10 you can ignore cows
 eulerscheZahl: best case: 1 try and i solve the 10 digit number :P
 dbdr: yes, so it's balancing
 eulerscheZahl: Marchete why? performance improvement?
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise i don't see a point
 Marchete: in my case I timeouted
 MSmits: how much code did you have to write for bulls and cows eulerscheZahl`?
 MSmits: seems like a tiny bot?
 eulerscheZahl: 226 lines atm
 eulerscheZahl: i could do some cleanup
 MSmits: ah ok, so 400 for me
 MSmits: this is the euler-smits linecount conversion law
 eulerscheZahl: but better score for youanother law
 MSmits: mmh didnt you pass me at NS?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but it's the puzzle of the week \o/
 MSmits: oh, I thought you did
 dbdr: yeah, plenty of new players
 dbdr: was 90 before I think
 MSmits: ahh thats why i got some rank
 eulerscheZahl: and a 3 star rating&#160;:(
 MSmits: 38th now
 MSmits: what!
 MSmits: barbarians!
 dbdr: let's see if I voted
 MSmits: 5 stars from me
 eulerscheZahl: i didn'ti never vote
 eulerscheZahl: except for the plagiarism puzzle (low ratin = autoremove)
 dbdr: ah, one 3 stars
 dbdr: but 4.9 avg
 MSmits: mmh it says here you got 36 times 5 stars....
 MSmits: this one guy who gave 3 just saw numbers and freaked out :P
 Marchete: can I vote 1 fon Bender 4=
 Marchete:&#160;?
 dbdr: quite a pessimitic way to look at it
 Marchete: on*
 Marchete: I hate it
 eulerscheZahl: of course you canbut you will make toad sad
 Marchete: what's the least to not make you sad?
 eulerscheZahl: bender isn't harder than "don't panic 2"
 dbdr: why Java Marchete?
 dbdr: maybe I already asked
 Marchete: to clone the referee :D
 MSmits: mmh it says westicles is rank 2
 dbdr: lazy lazy :D
 MSmits: but he is rank 1 with you dbdr
 Marchete: extreme lazyness, reporting for duty
 MSmits: i guess first in keeps the rank
 dbdr: the ranking never shows equals
 dbdr: but I think he gets all the CPs
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well the score is integer, so in this case we know for sure
 dbdr: also, it seems now they use submit date to sort for equals
 dbdr: for display, not for points
 eulerscheZahl: yes, same CP for both
 eulerscheZahl: did you improve your code to reach 500?
 dbdr: he was hiding 150 levels I think
 Marchete: wow
 dbdr: from 353 to 49x
 Marchete: you are amazing
 Westicles: Then he caught me in a day.  How embarrasing
 Marchete: I got stuck on 335 and never looked back
 dbdr: when I was at 444
 dbdr: Westicles :D are you running now?
 dbdr: reminds me of the cold war&#160;;)
 Westicles: Nah... it would take me 2 weeks to get to 600, then boom tied again
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, i think the game will crash around level 700
 Marchete: make some kind of truce
 dbdr: tempting...
 MSmits: you have to do it now Westicles, before it is summer and the heat is wasted
 eulerscheZahl: 50ms per turn =&gt; 600 turns maxthat's 600 move actions
 Marchete: think on those little bits
 dbdr: the crash I mean  :smiling_imp:
 Marchete: they are scared
 Westicles: If I get quarantined I'll do it
 eulerscheZahl: so depending on the particular solution you find, it even crashes for a different level
 dbdr: so 600, not 700?
 MSmits: lol,  get as high as possible with as few as possible moves
 MSmits: new challenge
 eulerscheZahl: not every new level adds a new move
 dbdr: sounds more and more like TGD :D
 Marchete: Imagine you get a solution but it's too large to be accepted...
 dbdr: need to find a better one
 dbdr: ah, 600 turns
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl, if you were inclined to do so, could you not compress the moves into less steps?
 dbdr: let me check my longest solution
 eulerscheZahl: i know how to modify the referee to accept the solutionjust haven't done yet
 MSmits: ah ok
 Westicles: My longest is around 490 I think
 dbdr: ╰─➤  wc -l log.txt 144722 log.txt
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: read multiple lines at oncecan even be a function of numbers remaining on the board
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: time to truncate your log
 MSmits: yeah my log is huge too and i only made 208
 eulerscheZahl: number shifting or movie collection, tough decision :D
 dbdr: my latest solution is 550 moves
 MSmits: maybe quickly watch matrix trilogy and then vow to never watch it again, saves a lot of space
 eulerscheZahl: getting closer to the limit
 reCurse: Or just watch the first one and ignore rumors a trilogy was in the works
 Westicles: 550 moves... I smell a rat.  You must be well into the 500s
 dbdr: matrix is a trilogy in one episode
 MSmits: yeah... tbh I rewatched them and I only really liked the first one
 dbdr: unlike THHGTTG, which is a trilogy in 7 episodes
 MSmits: whats that
 dbdr: really?
 MSmits: are you just stringing characters together dbdr
 reCurse: I'm lost with your analogy
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy</a>
 MSmits: oh ok that one, yes I read the books
 dbdr: both trilogies in some other number than 3
 reCurse: That makes no sense
 MSmits: thats true, a trilogy should be 3
 dbdr:  /s?
 reCurse: I don't get your point
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3225e873-186d-4cb6-9b6e-03e465618638">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3225e873-186d-4cb6-9b6e-03e465618638</a>
 MSmits: maybe we should discuss that plague game instead&#160;? :P
 reCurse: Ah, didn't know that
 reCurse: I already resolved that discussion MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: corona joke?
 reCurse: But you were missing
 MSmits: ow&#160;:(
 MSmits: no eulerscheZahl, you missed a long discussion
 MSmits: about a game idea
 MSmits: and balance
 Westicles: They are bringing 1000 people off that cruise ship within 2 miles of me.  
 MSmits: we did it quietly so as not to disturb you in your sleepp
 dbdr: Westicles, hold your breath for a few weeks
 eulerscheZahl: or get infected and realize that it mostly kills old people and you are safe
 MSmits: mostly safe :P
 dbdr: mostly harmless
 MSmits: 3,4% death rate now. Italy almost completely in quarantine. Pretty extreme
 MSmits: funerals arent even allowed as I understand it
 Westicles: I'm a germ freak from way back, so hopefully that will protect me
 MSmits: if you avoided them all your life, I doubt it
 MSmits: well maybe if you can avoid this one also&#160;:)
 reCurse: IIRC experts said something between 40 to 60% of world population would be in contact at the end
 reCurse: So just make peace with it
 Westicles: Well, I won't go sticking my finger in my eye, but a stray burrito might get me
 reCurse: And be thankful it's not a worse virus
 MSmits: well some effort may cause you to be on the right side of that 50-50
 MSmits: like, locking yourself in the house and do a bunch of multis
 MSmits: I see multiple advantages of that approach
 eulerscheZahl: name another advantage
 MSmits: you get to do multis
 reCurse: If that means uttt I might risk going outside instead
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: - uttt or death?- death please
 darkhorse64:    uttt to death
 MSmits: heyy darkhorse64
 MSmits: want me to explain the eval thing?
 darkhorse64: sure
 MSmits: i dont do the node priors thingy you mentioned, but I also dont use the discrete -1,0,1 score anymore
 MSmits: I thought about it like this
 MSmits: the eval is basically to estimate your advantage over the opponent
 MSmits: at some point the advantage is going to be large enough that it's almost certain you win
 MSmits: so you want that to give score 1, the same as an actual win
 darkhorse64: and you cannot choose any move because all look good
 dbdr: why lose the precision?
 MSmits: so all float values between -1 and +1 are possible. I define a max advantage
 MSmits: it's not a loss
 dbdr: sounds arbitrary
 MSmits: you dont want a solved win to be less important than a high advantage
 MSmits: sometimes an eval score gets really high due to an artefact in your evak
 MSmits: eval
 MSmits: that easily happens with many parameters
 MSmits: you need to cap it at the win score
 dbdr: solved win should be 1.0, high advantage is still &lt;1
 MSmits: if its much lower than 1, it doesnt guide your search anymore
 dbdr: ah, your eval can go above 1?
 MSmits: it could if i didnt cap it
 dbdr: yes, then cap is useful
 MSmits: it is simply another parameter
 dbdr: or transform it the the -1,+1 range
 MSmits: you mean like that relu thing a NN uses?
 dbdr: e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function</a>
 dbdr: you can choose the steepness
 dbdr: yeah
 MSmits: interesting
 MSmits: isnt that an expensive function?
 dbdr: yeah, that could matter
 dbdr: definitely depends on the gam
 dbdr: e
 dbdr: if the sim is expensive like PCR, probably doesn't matter&#160;:)
 MSmits: the thing is though, it's not unrealistic to assume that after a certain point, an advantage gives you 100% chance to win
 dbdr: that's true
 darkhorse64: You will face that problem with breakthrough. You build an overwhelming advantage and all moves have strong eval. How can you choose a move with -1, 1 criteria. You really need to look at the true eval
 dbdr: since you don't play randomly
 MSmits: but darkhorse64, you dont know the true eval
 dbdr: for random play, it would be true a huge advantge is still not 100%
 darkhorse64: I mean the eval value not the discretized one
 MSmits: float normalized = evalScore / MAX_ADVANTAGE;
 darkhorse64: It might be dangerous if your cap value is not well tuned
 MSmits: in the lower extreme it is the same as what i was doing before
 dbdr: Darkorse64: if all moves have strong eval, it could mean it does not matter which one you pick
 MSmits: namely, returning -1, 0 or 1
 MSmits: so it can only be an improvement
 MSmits: if my max advantage is near to 0 I mean
 MSmits: I also noticed, that as soon as I implemented this, my bot became better without the simulation phase entirely (sim depth 0)
 darkhorse64: Trust me, it matters because of horizon effect. You keep playing weak moves that seemingly does not degrade your position until you r bot realizes it's losing
 MSmits: It lost the need for a random components
 dbdr: but that means your eval is imperfect
 dbdr: which it has to be of course
 dbdr: but that also means trusting small differences that might be noise
 MSmits: darkhorse64 if your exploration param is somewhat higher, will you not be able to find better board states for your bot?
 darkhorse64: It is but not to the point it cannot distinguish strong moves
 MSmits: if it goes down a wrong branch the way you describe, it just seems it doesnt explore well?
 darkhorse64: Breakthrough endings are tactical which is a weak spot for mcts. Remember shallow traps in Y
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: but I think you need a very heavy eval for breakthrough
 reCurse: Yinsh?
 reCurse: This comment was sponsored by struct
 MSmits: this solves the problem (partially) for  Y also
 MSmits: :P
 darkhorse64: Also the branching factor is quite high and does not decrease
 MSmits: you do need TT I think
 MSmits: it helps when all the pieces are the same
 darkhorse64: There is a lot to explore
 MSmits: Yea, you need to prune
 MSmits: you'll create blind spots, but what else are you gonna do
 darkhorse64: The issue is to find whether you have a breakthrough (you consider the advanced pieces). If not, you have to build your position which is a long term goal
 MSmits: did you try splitting the board into partitions and assess them strategically?
 MSmits: could use a lookup for that 
 MSmits: not saying that would be easy
 MSmits: lookups up to 3x3 should be possible
 MSmits: or maybe a lookup centered on each  pawn
 darkhorse64: The seminal paper describes something like that; consider the 2x3 rectangle in front of your pawn.
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense
 darkhorse64: Programming Breakthrough from Richard Lorentz
 MSmits: what i like about breakthrough is that you need to think more about the game to write the bot
 dbdr: darkhorse64, did you work much on Breakthrough?
 dbdr: you usually get much higher than that
 MSmits: ssht dbdr, thats a sore point
 MSmits: we dont talk about that
 darkhorse64: Yes, my bot is weak and I spend too much time on Oware
 dbdr: well, it's a praise in disguise
 MSmits: true
 dbdr: for the other multis
 MSmits: darkhorse64 is pretty good almost everywhere he tries yeah
 dbdr: well, we have to make choices, can't do them all in depth
 MSmits: darkhorse64, maybe I should try breakthrough and then we can suck at it together
 MSmits: we're good at similar games
 MSmits: so we might also suck similarly
 dbdr: is it a real Python at #8?
 MSmits: just need to finish this checker bot so i can leave it
 dbdr: above Robo :D
 MSmits: lol thats a NN isnt it?
 darkhorse64: The best thing to stop sucking is to play another game and learn from it
 reCurse: Python = NN, it is known
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: I mean Robo's
 MSmits: he said something about trying and failing at breakthrough NN
 reCurse: You're messing up my NN and now my memes
 MSmits: not sure if thats also his submission
 reCurse: This is war
 MSmits: :worried:
 darkhorse64: War of the machines
 dbdr: the only winning move is not to play

 dbdr: special dedication to reCurse&#160;;)
 MSmits: yea
 reCurse: If I could go back in time I'd block CG on my end
 reCurse: Only way to avoid uttt for sure
 MSmits: and also, fix baby hitler
 Astrobytes: By blocking CG?
 eulerscheZahl: accept hit at art academia, so he doesn't get stupid ideas
 MSmits: yea!
 MSmits: we'd have some great art and avoid WWII on the side
 eulerscheZahl: now i think about OverSimplified again and wait for the next video, thanks&#160;:/
 dbdr: he was in love with a jewish girl too
 MSmits: oh dont even know those videos.
 eulerscheZahl: history videos, but simplified and funny
 dbdr: I discovered kurzgesagt recently
 MSmits: so far it seems an add for skillshare?

 dbdr: yeah, it's in english
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Westicles: Ugh.  Us old folks can't watch that kind of stuff
 dbdr: maybe started in german?
 dbdr: they mention "in a nutshell" as well
 dbdr: which could be a lose translation
 MSmits: too fast Westicles?
 Westicles: It is like having your eyes pried open ala Clockwork Orange and shoving 10 minutes of memes into you

 brandon-1999: used*

 MSmits: happens to me all the time =/
 MSmits: think you had a Eureka, and turns out it;s a Meh....
 reCurse: Well on the plus side I did remember it's my old mcts code from uttt v-1
 reCurse: So there's always the possibility it helps for no cost
 MSmits: and maybe I overfitted against you and a small change destroys my bot winrate&#160;:)
 MSmits: (that's a serious possibility, given the extremely fine tuned params)
 Astrobytes:  Smits, how did you get on with the 1 &amp; 2 seed parameters?
 MSmits: just started refitting those. I never got that much better with that through self-play
 MSmits: maybe when i try vs robo + recurse
 Astrobytes: I still think they're weird
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: when i set seed1 to 0 as a value, my winrate plummets though
 MSmits: so either it compensates artificially for a lack elsewhere in my eval, or it really is needed 
 MSmits: hard to say...
 Astrobytes: I'm in param hell. On the plus side I now get 950K - 1.2 mill root visits first turn
 MSmits: good job
 MSmits: at least, I guess that's better than most top players 
 MSmits: not sure what the average is
 Astrobytes: Still work to do. More refactoring and sht tomorrow. 
 reCurse: orly
 reCurse: Maybe I need to reduce my NN size
 reCurse: Oh first turn
 MSmits: you have 24k or 26k right?
 MSmits: you said that earlier
 reCurse: First turn 442k
 reCurse: I meant on a regular turn
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: damn
 Astrobytes: First turn is meh as player 1, might as well just output 5
 MSmits: I have 3.6 million on first turn
 reCurse: Ok so I retract my retraction
 reCurse: Maybe I do need to reduce it
 MSmits: i do have to add
 MSmits: I get 6 visits out of 1 rollout
 MSmits: because I eval each child
 reCurse: Dunno if it matters
 MSmits: at the expanded node
 MSmits: me neither, but just to be clear
 Astrobytes: Still runs about the same no?
 MSmits: well the selection loop can get expensive
 MSmits: lots of UCB
 Astrobytes: true
 MSmits: reCurse not sure if you save your board on the node or if you re-apply moves 
 MSmits: but saving the board seems better
 reCurse: Those optims don't matter with NN
 MSmits: yeah i guess all the calc-time goes into the NN-use
 Astrobytes: regular turn I have 70-85k
 struct: cpp?
 MSmits: bout 3 times that for me
 MSmits: cpp for me yes
 Astrobytes: I've just started rewriting. 
 Astrobytes: Nodes still heavy
 struct: Im still in learning process of AVX
 MSmits: what heavy about them?
 struct: It has been fun
 Astrobytes: They've got pointers, arrays
 MSmits: hmm not sure if pointers are bad
 Astrobytes: No, to parents and children, rather use indices
 MSmits: i usually use integer indices to the node pool, because they are half the size of a pointer
 MSmits: but its not that big of a deal
 struct: I dont think they are slower tbh
 struct: pointer should not be slower than array[index]
 struct: But I can be mistaken
 MSmits: memory caching
 Astrobytes: yeah that. It is faster. But I also have my gamestate
 MSmits: pointer should be 8 byte
 MSmits: integer index 4 byte
 MSmits: but its a small thing really, microoptim
 struct: Soon I move to sim phase of CSB
 MSmits: oh and dont keep a parent index Astrobytes
 MSmits: it is useless
 MSmits: do back prop with a list of nodes
 MSmits: gather them up during selection, then loop over them
 Astrobytes: list of visited nodes right
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: Yep, cool
 struct: yeah I do that on UTTT
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7f21ecd8-ddf2-4489-9a4f-1c1d461b490d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7f21ecd8-ddf2-4489-9a4f-1c1d461b490d</a>
 MSmits: this is my node
 MSmits: it's really tiny and i never really tested the effect of using int_8s, it might actually slow me
 MSmits: total size 24 byte if i'm not mistaken. 
 struct: yes 24
 Astrobytes: yeah that looks nice nad light, my state is stored on the node tho, and my board is an array of uint8_t
 Astrobytes: *and
 MSmits: my state is also stored on the node
 MSmits: thats the uint64_t board
 struct: you dont store move?
 MSmits: 8 out of the 24 bytes
 MSmits: i dont
 Astrobytes: Yeah but you've got it bitboarded
 MSmits: i dont need the move if i've got the board resulting from the move
 Astrobytes: I don't store move either
 MSmits: it's a pain when you output your move though, you have to reverse engineer the children boards :P
 MSmits: it's much worse on checkers
 MSmits: try reverse engineering a multi jump :P
 reCurse: Have you noticed a side imbalance btw
 Astrobytes: in Oware?
 reCurse: Yes
 Astrobytes: P1
 MSmits: I never checked, every test I did swaps
 MSmits: awari is solved as a draw, but that doesnt mean there isnt an imbalance
 reCurse: Ok it takes 16 minutes to start beating you
 reCurse: Not bad
 MSmits: you're training it anew&#160;?
 Astrobytes: brb
 reCurse: Yeah with my new mcts I did fo ruttt
 MSmits: oh cool
 reCurse: Also changed a couple things I know work better
 reCurse: We'll see
 MSmits: well as i said, do test it vs other players also. I might be overfitting, so your bot might just be breaking my overfit
 struct: At least you are safe at Yavalath MSmits
 reCurse: It took minutes to beat everyone back then
 reCurse: Like 5 minutes at most
 reCurse: Except robo
 MSmits: i was just gonna say
 MSmits: robo is a tough nut
 MSmits: how do you know it works well vs me? Do you start a cg bench?
 MSmits: or do you download some replays?
 reCurse: No I just checked if I could win
 reCurse: Means it's in the ballpark
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but you could already win
 MSmits: my current submit had like 55%
 reCurse: I also notice it has a much easier time as p1
 reCurse: Hence my question
 MSmits: it's highly unstable, winrates may hinge on a single move(type)
 MSmits: at least thats what I noticed
 MSmits: sometimes I did a submit with a small change and agade suddenly beats me 90%
 reCurse: Sure, I was talking about sides tho
 reCurse: This bit annoys me way more
 MSmits: yeah my point was, if it is so unstable, it might be true for p1 vs p2 too
 reCurse: Not necessarily
 MSmits: thats why i said might :P
 reCurse: Ok I need to run a bench but I think it broke your overfit
 MSmits: what annoys you?
 reCurse: In 23 minutes
 struct: UTTT v2?
 reCurse: Side imbalance is very annoying
 reCurse: I'm assuming it doesn't exist
 reCurse: So it speeds up everything by 2
 MSmits: well I hope you're having fun doing this and not doing it because I am frustrating you again :P
 reCurse: You know the answer to that
 MSmits: :grin:
 reCurse: Doesn't beat my old bot yet though
 Astrobytes: From day 1 of this multi P1 seemed stronger, seems they have the advantage, yet perfect play results in a draw
 reCurse: By the time it does it will start losing against you
 MSmits: tons of rps here
 MSmits: for a long time i had 0% Robo 40% you even though you beat Robo
 MSmits: it is very likely that after you're done training and I'm still fitting, i'll run into a combination of params that wins again. That's why your first instinct, to wait till I am distracted, might have been good
 MSmits: I wont go back after i'm done
 reCurse: I'm not a smart guy
 Astrobytes: Famous last words there
 Astrobytes: @Smits
 MSmits: nah really. I see so many nice games  I really want to try
 MSmits: breakthrough, that bulls/cows game
 MSmits: even onitama, just because it looks pretty
 reCurse: If I'm lucky it will give me opportunity to test training regression mitigation
 reCurse: Might be useful elsewhere
 MSmits: whats tha
 reCurse: Prevent self-play from collapsing
 reCurse: Catastrophic forgetting
 MSmits: is that similar to parameter drifting?
 reCurse: Don't think so
 MSmits: I may be following a course on AI for my studies for CS teaching
 Astrobytes: To prevent overfitting?
 MSmits: I wasnt supposed to do this because it is an area I already know a lot about, but another class got cancelled
 reCurse: I guess you could say it's overfitting
 Astrobytes: @reCurse
 reCurse: But it's more subtle than that
 Astrobytes: Nice MSmits, should hopefully be interesting
 MSmits: well it's a tradeoff between not learning very much because it's your favorite subject and liking the class a lot because it's your favorite subject&#160;:)
 MSmits: they do machine learning also, but probably not very in depth
 reCurse: I have a very low opinion of courses
 MSmits: me too, generally
 MSmits: but you see, it might be nice to talk about this subject with a live person as opposed to on chat
 MSmits: i dont know anyone in real life that is interested in this
 Astrobytes: Same. Well, one, but he's a stoner and never does anything.
 MSmits: lol
 struct: Who is interested in AVX?
 Astrobytes: I guess as long as you can discuss topics beyond the reach of the course then it might be beneficial
 MSmits: I am struct, I wish I could find a way to use it in a bot
 MSmits: Astrobytes exactly. Also we may get a project to work on and that may finally give me an excuse to do some machine learning, or something else I have yet to try
 struct: I would also like to learn ML
 struct: But one thing at a time
 MSmits: yeah, I am already doing 3 things at once now
 Astrobytes: Well, there's Kaggle I guess if you're into data
 reCurse: Halite is merging into Kaggle
 MSmits: I'm not, really
 reCurse: So they'll have AI competition too
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw that
 MSmits: into data I mean
 Astrobytes: i think they plan to do more AI competitions iirc? They have a connect 4 one or something
 MSmits: why would you have a connect 4 competition?
 struct: There should still be a connect 4 somewhere here
 Astrobytes: Might be connect(n), can't remember
 struct: At least I made it before
 struct: Just the demo though
 MSmits: connect n makes more sense
 MSmits: or connect 4 without first making 3
 MSmits: that would be a great game right struct&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Ohhh I wonder
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: Maybe we can also make it 6 directions?
 MSmits: oh... like on a hex board?
 struct: Oh right, thats what it is called
 dbdr: connect N in M dimensions
 darkhorse64: That's 3 directions
 MSmits: 3 axes
 Astrobytes: lol. I need to do something for that Yavalath. I lost the will to live trying to bitboard it last year
 MSmits: it's a pain to bitboard yes
 MSmits: I enjoyed it up to a point
 darkhorse64: It's aj joy you mean
 MSmits: well at some point it got a little crazy
 MSmits: add to that mcts bugs and it can get frustrating to debug
 Astrobytes: I'm sure I threw my whiteboard across the room at one point
 Astrobytes: (small whiteboard)
 MSmits: i should have a whiteboard
 MSmits: at home i mean
 struct: Just bring one from school
 MSmits: the one the size of a wall you mean?
 struct: Yeah
 struct: They will fit in the train
 Astrobytes: Ye, I have a big one for the wall, smaller one for the lap (both sides), and wipeable paper notebooks (that I must clean)
 MSmits: yeah, i dont think the train is the issue
 Astrobytes: (not all for CG I may add!)
 MSmits: sounds very professional
 MSmits: I just have paper all over the place with squiggles on them I lose understanding of about an hour after writing it down
 struct: In all the movies I watch, the physics guy always have a white board
 struct: You need one
 Astrobytes: Oh CG-wise I have pages of useless numbers
 MSmits: i know struct, but I have a wife
 struct: you can't have both?
 Astrobytes: I whiteboard stuff, but I'm lazy and use my notepad a lot.... 
 darkhorse64: The part of my code in Yavalath which gives me pride is the one where I look for traps just with pdep/pext
 struct: Guess im ditching my white board
 MSmits: yeah, me too darkhorse64
 MSmits: did much walking before I came up with that
 darkhorse64: Pencil/paper is enough
 darkhorse64: It makes me sad that I had to disable it in rollouts (no gain)
 MSmits: oh
 Astrobytes: Which? Pencil or paper? :P 
 MSmits: its really impossible for me to do any meaningful improvement to yavalath. I have no way of testing. The opening book trumps every possible change
 darkhorse64: Test without&#160;?
 MSmits: theres no point to that, the bot will never be without
 MSmits: and there is no guarantee that an improvement without, is an improvement with
 Illedan: Is the openingbook with 6 way rotation?
 MSmits: 12
 MSmits: there are 12 symmetries
 darkhorse64: If it makes your bot stronger without, it's likely to be best with
 Illedan: ah k
 MSmits: not really darkhorse64 because when you're optimizing without book, you'll be optimizing to avoid the traps that occur in early game
 MSmits: but i dont need to, because I have the book
 Astrobytes: Hm, not necessarily, cause you're compensating for actions the opening book will counter or prevent
 MSmits: yep
 Astrobytes: @darkhorse
 MSmits: but i cant be sure darkhorse64, its hard to say. Yavalath is pretty messy early game
 darkhorse64: And for traps out of the book&#160;? I mean they can occur quite late although I agree the game gets less tactical after a while 
 MSmits: you mean traps out of book that occur later on, if you are using the book?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: you can optimize it a bit for that, but you need to find an opponent that is going to survive early game. However, any opponent I have seen that does that, has very little variation. It's hard to do a good test
 darkhorse64: Notice I have no data to back up this claim. Just thinking aloud
 MSmits: yeah my data is not that great either. Self play is useless mostly and any opponent I try to train against will soon have an anti-book 
 MSmits: it's ridiculous how few moves I need to counter someone
 Astrobytes: The MCTS should be able to deal with that late game issue though? it's the early traps it fails in right? minimax will probably negotiate the early traps OK (also thinking out loud, don't even have a bot lol)
 MSmits: yes, seems minimax is better to avoid early game traps
 MSmits: and late game mcts is very good I think
 Astrobytes: Hence the need for opening book
 MSmits: yeah, but minimax would benefit from it too
 MSmits: you can also search through the book and get deeper
 Astrobytes: For sure yeah
 MSmits: if you already know the move you play, your branching becomes 1
 MSmits: not just on the root, but on any layer you have a book move for
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed
 MSmits: so the moment you leave the book, you still have a small advantage because you have a tree from previous turns that got a bit deeper
 MSmits: I also use transpositions on yavalath. I think it hurts early game
 MSmits: but because of the book, who cares about early game anyway
 darkhorse64: Here comes the dilemna: explore the bad moves to get ready for opponent bad moves or explore your book to get deeper&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah I never got that far into it, i just do regular exploration for my opponent moves
 MSmits: btw, it's nothing magical what I do, anyone with sufficient obsession-fuel can beat me on Y
 MSmits: just run a book for a few weeks 
 MSmits: meta mcts
 darkhorse64: months you mean 
 MSmits: or do like re curse and run 10 cores
 MSmits: well most people will try to thread it
 Astrobytes: I was gonna say didn't you have that running for months
 MSmits: i only ever did 1 core
 Astrobytes: sheesh
 MSmits: i had it running for 2 months or so? then did uttt
 MSmits: not full time btw, proll 12 hrs a day
 Astrobytes: half-time...
 MSmits: yeah, my wife doesnt like the computer on at night or when nobody is home
 MSmits: it might start the machine uprising when it's not being watched
 MSmits: or cause a fire, whatever happens first
 Astrobytes: #2 most likely
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Though low probability for both tbh
 MSmits: sure, it never caused a fire while I was there to watch it either
 MSmits: I do like the fact that i got nr 1, but the meta mcts is really about learning about the game as well. That worked well for Y, not that well for uttt, because its hard to see anything in that game
 MSmits: probably will be hard for oware as well... It's not that easy to see what works and what doesnt
 MSmits: gonna netflix a bit before sleep
 MSmits: no alcohol and picard for me, but I need to see that series somehow
 Astrobytes: Haha, you can download it easily tbh
 darkhorse64: Happy binge watching&#160;!
 Astrobytes: And enjoy
 MSmits: no doubt Astrobytes, ttyl guys, gn

 mr.mister: hmm, this is really weird. what does this mean? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/JoHZeu6.png">https://pasteboard.co/JoHZeu6.png</a>
 Allis: @mr.mister Found: "Nothing" indicates you didn't print anything.
 mr.mister: @allis but as you can see it says I printed "UNKNOWN"
 Allis: You only print that if $ni == 1; it must be the case that it doesn't.
 mr.mister: but do you see a line above that?
 mr.mister: it says standard output stream
 mr.mister: then UNKNOWN
 Allis: Oh, yes, I see. That *is* strange.
 Allis: What it then means is that the output is expected to contain N lines, and you printed fewer than that.
 mr.mister: Also, it says expected "UNKNOWN"
 mr.mister: which is exactly what I printed
 Allis: Yes, but if it expects three lines of output and you only print one, you'll get the Found: "Nothing" message.
 Allis: That is, it found nothing where it expected to find a second line.
 Allis: I grant that this can be pretty confusing at first, but the test cases always clearly indicate whether you should print the results on a single line or multiple.
 mr.mister: how can I see the input for a given test?
 eulerscheZahl: MadKnight is back \o/
 eulerscheZahl: we missed you
 MadKnight: yea i heard
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl are u using a chat client&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: webchat
 MadKnight: PM eulerscheZahl
 MadKnight: DM
 DaNinja: mr.mister You need to echo the newline too
 DaNinja: echo "UNKNOWN\n";
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl someone rekt my CSB bot so i had to return to implement a more fancy algo and get back
 BenjaminUrquhart: who rekt
 MadKnight: YurkovAS
 MadKnight: hey BenjaminUrquhart have u tried using smitsimax yet&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: someone gave me a rundown on it but I forgot
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's a tech.io page on it, right?
 Marchete: :o it's MadKnight!
 MadKnight: yea and i got u a new fancy algo for CSB Marchete
 MadKnight: i know u love those
 Marchete: what algo?
 MadKnight: combination of MCTS with smitse
 MadKnight: smitsi
 BenjaminUrquhart: found it, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/36476/smitsimax</a>

 MadKnight: now play a bit of this
 REZ16: oke
 REZ16: hey @MadKnight, i'm having trouble with the thrust
 MadKnight: what trouble&#160;?
 REZ16: idk where to change the thrust
 MadKnight: your code prints the thrust
 MadKnight: just print a different thrust
 REZ16: so i have to write print(.)??
 MadKnight: don't u already have this print&#160;?
 REZ16: yea
 MadKnight: then change it
 REZ16: i did but it diddnt work out
 REZ16: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + "50")
 REZ16: i change 50 to 100
 REZ16: but it seem not right
 REZ16: so i change " " to "100"
 REZ16: but still not work
 SPDene: you're adding "50" to the end of str(next_checkpoint_y). make sure there's a space between them
 REZ16: where?str(next_checkpoint_y 100)?
 REZ16: or what?
 REZ16: i'm sorry for being so stupid but i just begin to learn it
 SPDene: is checkpoint_x is 100 and checkpoint_y is 200, that code ^ will print "100 20050", when it should be 100 200 50"
 REZ16: so how can i fix that?
 SPDene: you're using python, right?
 REZ16: yea
 SPDene: so... you don't need the str() round the numbers... python will deal with that for you...
 REZ16: *numbers
 SPDene: I'd put the value of thrust in a variable, then print the 3 values (the default is they will be separated by spaces):
 REZ16: thank you so much
 Nightpl3x: hey does anyone have an idea how I could further improve my 'coders strike back' bot after entering bronze league, i'm stuck on rank 167
 AntiSquid: resub spam, -3vel, use opponent to bounce your pod off
 AntiSquid: Nightpl3x
 MadKnight: hihi squiddy
 dbdr: hey MadKnight!
 MadKnight: hihi dbdr
 dbdr: what's up?
 MadKnight: doing algos
 dbdr: what kind of algos?
 MadKnight: MCTS kind 
 MadKnight: the jolin's one
 dbdr: no idea what jolin is...
 tanmaycodernovice: anyone worked with sound module in python?
 Marchete: improved D&amp;B bot?
 dbdr: me?
 darkhorse64: jolindien stuff for XR&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: hi MadimetjaEmmanuelLebelo
 AntiSquid: hi MadKnight
 AntiSquid: are you doing XR MadKnight?
 AntiSquid: decoupled mcts, that's what it's called Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i don't want to live in
 Marchete: you are 1st again...
 darkhorse64: MadKnight said he managed smitsimax to wprk for CSB
 darkhorse64: *work*
 AntiSquid: #10 ... good enough
 MSmits: 10 on csb?
 MSmits:  Thats really good
 AntiSquid: the CP difference at that point is irrelevant LOL
 AntiSquid: i think it's 50 CP difference between #100 and #1 :D
 MSmits: something like that
 MSmits: welcome back MadKnight
 MSmits: looks like yurkovas made smitsi work too, at least, he was working on it
 eulerscheZahl: you don't play CSB for the global leaderboard. you play it for the sake of CSB
 MSmits: yeah I guess so, the interesting part of the leaderboard of CSB has almost no cp value
 MSmits: (differentially)
 darkhorse64: 23  ELO diff between 1 and 100. Need an extra league
 AntiSquid: csb isn't the kind of game i'd play "just for fun"
 MSmits: same AntiSquid... the only reason I stuck with it for a month or so is cuz it was going well. Hard to quit when you're ahead. 
 AntiSquid: makes sense
 MSmits: still working on D&amp;B myself. 
 MSmits: I finally finished putting the solver heuristics from the papers into the bot
 MSmits: but then I found that almost every end game is non-simple. So I am adding more heuristics to decompose complex object into simple ones
 darkhorse64: I read the thesis Marchete linked yesterday. Very interesting
 MSmits: i guess it's because the papers were written for 5x5, far more chance to simple end games
 MSmits: yeah it's interesting and easier to read, but actually not too much new in it, except if you're interested in the functional programming bit
 darkhorse64: At least, it's well explained even it's only helpful for some endgames
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: Still bitboarding&#160;?
 Marchete: and it gives ideas for data representation
 MSmits: sure, why not bitboard?
 Marchete: like I'm not sure about bitboards
 Marchete: maybe for some checks
 Solacefire: I feel like the clash of code challenges really, really want you to learn how to create an array of chars
 Marchete: or do you have highe level chain detection?
 Marchete: like loops and stuff
 MSmits: I have that yes, but it's mostly floodfill
 MSmits: you can detect a chain by floodfilling an object and then see if at least one of them has only one neighbor connection
 MSmits: with bitboard that is basically one bit operation (&amp;) with the map of 1 connection boxes
 MSmits: both of the objects being uint64_t
 MSmits: and then you popcount to get the length of the chain
 MSmits: have to also check if there are no joins (3+ connections) in the object
 MSmits: another &amp; operation
 dbdr: darkhorse64: leagues have no effect on CPs
 dbdr: MSmits: your arena bot uses the endgame solver now?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: it's useless because of what i said about simple endgames
 MSmits: almost every end game has a join in it ( a 3 way split)
 darkhorse64: I know, I was pointing out the level difference
 MSmits: you can decompose a 3 or 4 way split if they're all chains, but that requires more heuristics
 MSmits: also not done with the part that turns the board value into an actual action
 MSmits: this :poop: is hard
 jrke: dbdr again first in D&amp;B 
 MSmits: also, I need a way to deal with end games that contain 1 or more objects that can't be decomposed and handled by heuristics. It needs an efficiÃ«nt minimax
 MSmits: should be doable with tiny overhead if it's just a matter of choosing when and how to open these complex objects. Branching should be small
 MSmits: I am guessing you guys are doing this already but as a regular minimax
 MSmits: btw, my samegame meta mcts is still running also, nearly 155k now&#160;:)
 MSmits: going pretty slow but steady
 dbdr: ah, now I know why it's so hot
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: it's just using 1 core, the other core is still trying to beat jacek at oware, with little success
 MSmits: it's interesting though, some branches going 70 plies deep now, no fundamental mistakes found. Kudos to jacek
 MSmits: I managed to find them for Robo's bot in half this time
 Marchete: jrke are you really 13 years old?
 jrke: yes
 Marchete: awesome
 MSmits: mmh that makes me 3x awesome, I like it
 <b>**MSmits will warp your logic anytime anywhere</b></p><p><img src="/a/23569690082631" /> Marchete: whats a "simple endgame"?
 MSmits: just loops and chains
 MSmits: no 3 way splits
 Marchete: well, I shouldn't consider 3 way an endgame
 Marchete: but I'm still reading stuff
 MSmits: it is an endgame because you cant place a line in the 3 way without giving away boxes
 MSmits: loony endgame =  any line you place gives away one or more boxes
 MSmits: sometimes it's defined a little further in, after 1 and 2 length chains have all been removed
 MSmits: so the smallest chain = 3
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/484372597">https://www.codingame.com/replay/484372597</a> frame 56 end game starts
 MSmits: B4 and G4 have 4 way splits with chains
 MSmits: which makes the endgame non-simple
 MSmits: sorry G4 is 3 way
 MSmits: Pretty sure jrke should have taken A4 at frame 57 though
 MSmits: no reason not to
 MSmits: now dbdr ends up having both
 MSmits: A4 and A1
 MSmits: This is one of those games where its hard to make an AI doesn't make mistakes a human can spot in 3 seconds.
 MSmits: *that
 Marchete: reaching from a 3 way to a "simple endgame" isn't part of the search algo?
 MSmits: you mean the solver heuristics?
 Marchete: my idea was more like search until you reach an endgame
 MSmits: not in the paper no, but I think you can come up with them yourself, if they are all chains
 Marchete: your kind of "simple endgame"
 MSmits: yes, but what if the 3 way shouldnt be opened until it's the last object?
 MSmits: then you have a huge searchspace
 Marchete: and then return eval a difference score
 MSmits: better if you can simplify the 3 way split with heuristics and then solve it right at frame 56
 MSmits: instead of going off into a deep search
 Marchete: do you think it can be solved?
 dbdr: is there any research on that MSmits?
 MSmits: I've seen T-splits mentioned
 MSmits: but i did not find actual proofs or algorithms that include the splits
 MSmits: but you can reason them out
 MSmits: if the split has branches of 1 or 2 length you can easily see that you should take those first
 MSmits: and taking 1 and 2 first is part of the known algorithm
 MSmits: so those are trivial
 MSmits: like the one at join A4 (the one thats first opened at frame 56)
 MSmits: also part of the algorithm is that chains should be opened in order of length
 MSmits: so my guess is that you can just open the splits in order of their chain lengths, but not 100% on that
 MSmits: and it doesnt work with splits containing loops
 MSmits: but they are more rare, so this may cover 90% of endgames
 MSmits: G4 in the game I shared, is a loop actually
 Marchete: I was just thinking about minimax/MCTS those 3 ways, I imagine a lot of states are similar
 MSmits: yes, the idea is to minimax the objects you cant simplify
 MSmits: but the less you do this, the better your algorithm will be
 MSmits: so dont do it when it is not necessary
 Marchete: yeah, and that's why I find out graphs so useful and nice in this game
 Marchete: simple search bots can't perform well 
 MSmits: it's pretty hard to define simple here though
 MSmits: there are many ways to search 
 Marchete: simple == minimax lines one by one
 MSmits: do you consider every line? Or maybe only 1 line out of a chain
 MSmits: ahh right, thats not good
 Marchete: but that's what we do in many other games...
 MSmits: true, but not all. You probably shouldnt do it in Twixt either
 MSmits: interestingly, also an ericsmso game
 MSmits: also game where humans easily beat most AIs
 MSmits: for minimax in this game, i can see how to prune moves as an easy improvement on "try all lines" 
 MSmits: but I dont see how to evaluate a game
 MSmits: except when it gets to endgames
 MSmits: and you can count boxes
 Marchete: yeah, I can't see any evaluation until endgame yet
 Marchete: maybe "distance" to the desired number of chains
 MSmits: there is just 1 thing and thats counting chains and check if the number is even or odd, but that changes so much that it seems meaningless in large maps
 MSmits: for most of the game
 MSmits: Marchete the distance is 1 or 0
 MSmits: and thats what i meant 
 MSmits: when you know you're not going to win the control race, you can try to make many loops and 3 chains, according to literature, but it's hard to quantify this in an AI also
 Marchete: I still don't know
 MSmits: because how do you "know" for sure
 MSmits: when there's still many lines to fill in before the end game
 MSmits: thats why I am thinking mcts with heuristic end game solver
 MSmits: rollout till endgame, then use the solver
 MSmits: solver may include short minimax for complex objects
 MSmits: you can backpropagate win/loss or boxcount
 Marchete: I was thinking that too
 MSmits: boxcount is interesting when you use unscored states
 MSmits: and transpositions
 MSmits: this game has many
 Marchete: MCTS, a good game representation with a good hash for duplicated states
 MSmits: this is where bitboards come in
 Marchete: nah
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4054e225-ddf0-4466-91bb-82079e722b3b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4054e225-ddf0-4466-91bb-82079e722b3b</a>
 MSmits: thats really cheap
 Marchete: again, I'm trying to go really high level
 Marchete: on board representation
 Marchete: and trying to use similar structures than <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2015/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2015-068.pdf">https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2015/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2015-068.pdf</a>
 MSmits: the thing is, I do the chain analysis only on expansion and on the end of a rollout, so i also have the high level board representation but it's converted from the bitboard
 MSmits: yeah i saw that, thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's a good source
 Marchete: with high level I mean: M chains of type X, N of type Y, O of type Z
 MSmits: yes, i do that
 Marchete: not even how it's done
 Marchete: not horiz or vert
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c226c317-ab54-46fb-a5d4-6f255017561f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c226c317-ab54-46fb-a5d4-6f255017561f</a>
 Marchete: so that
 MSmits: whenever i need to expand a node, i do the analysis
 MSmits: so once per rollout
 MSmits: well and possibly and the end of the rollout
 MSmits: so twice
 MSmits: not sure how bad the cost is compared to your method, but they achieve the same goal
 Marchete: but as a graph I just need to work with a single chain
 MSmits: sure
 Marchete: I don't know if bitboard can be faster
 Marchete: from experience I have a hard time with them
 Marchete: trying to get more high level info
 MSmits: yeah it's not easy at all
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34e4dcef-36ef-46b7-adff-92537551ad8c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34e4dcef-36ef-46b7-adff-92537551ad8c</a>
 Marchete: with a "chain" object
 Marchete: I can track number of nodes by type
 MSmits: yeah, that works fine
 MSmits: but in the early part of the game it's very messy
 MSmits: there are no chains then
 MSmits: just lines everywhere
 MSmits: how to do that in a graph?
 Marchete: as always
 MSmits: and how to make nodes in a tree
 Marchete: neighbours
 Marchete: and mark them to avoid loops
 MSmits: hmm i guess it depends on how quick it is to evolve your gamestate
 MSmits: applying a move
 MSmits: I guess it's just disconnecting a neighbor
 jrke: its interesting game but a good improvement giving 90%+ win rate
 Marchete: disconnect and then evaluate nodetype counts
 MSmits: what is jrke?
 Marchete: to know if it splits or create a know chain type
 jrke: d&amp;b
 Marchete: what improvement?
 MSmits: whats the improvement?
 Marchete: damn I have -1.80 score :D
 jrke: that dbdr made
 MSmits: lol i had that for a while until i tried a random bot&#160;:)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Marchete: dbdr_ won't tell you :D
 jrke: yeah i know
 MSmits: Marchete the main advantage to a bitboard i think is that when I do selection phase, I have 0 overhead to applying moves
 MSmits: so if i go 15 nodes deep in the search, i just do UCT and apply no moves
 MSmits: the gamestate is on the node
 MSmits: but that could be negligible, i don't know
 dbdr: jrke, I haven't made any improvement
 dbdr: you were winning before in one case and playing the same match over and over
 jrke: oh so you went for random choice
 MSmits: heh, you know why that's dangerous
 dbdr: yes
 MSmits: dont make me meta mcts this game, do randoms :P
 dbdr: yes, it's also a good prevention against MSmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: right&#160;:)
 Marchete: int seed = rand();//1000;
 Marchete: FTFY
 MSmits: should be real easy to prevent in this game, so many ways to randomly place lines with no change in win chances
 dbdr: Marchete, what are you fixing?
 jrke: marchete needs to fix his whole d&amp;b bot atm :stuck_out_tongue:
 dbdr: btw FTFY is supposed to be a small change on what someone else wrote
 MSmits: never heard it, let me urban it
 MSmits: ah'k
 dbdr: LEUTFY&#160;;)
 Marchete: your random seed dbdr
 Marchete: rand() instead of a constant
 MSmits: cant find leutfy
 MSmits: google thinks you really mean lofty
 dbdr: you don't know lmgtfy?
 MSmits: sure
 dbdr: then you're close
 dbdr: &gt; (02:04:43 PM) MSmits: never heard it, let me urban it
 MSmits:  :thinking: I give up
 dbdr: let me urban it for you
 MSmits: ahhhhhhhhh
 dbdr: Marchete: are you planning a bot in F#? Clojure? Haskell?
 MSmits: I've been wondering. Do these being functional programming languages make them slower? Say, compared to doing the same job in C++&#160;?
 MSmits: or does that not affect it
 dbdr: they all use GC, so at least for that yes
 dbdr: of course the definition of "functional PL" is vague
 MSmits: but does a functional programming language need a GC in principle?
 dbdr: some are pure, some not
 dbdr: depends how you define function PL&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: but in general they are slower, but provide advantages in conceptual thinking about your program&#160;?
 dbdr: you can do functional style in C++ and rust and C#/Java ...
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: I wouldnt want to do something like this in C++
 MSmits: at least C# has Linq
 dbdr: I suspect there are similar libraries in C++
 dbdr: maybe not part of the standard but 3rd party
 jrke: dbdr do you have something for endgame?
 MSmits: dbdr's bot does seem to play the end game better than your bot jrke
 MSmits: i see yours making mistakes sometimes
 MSmits: mistakes you can prevent with some heuristics
 jrke: ya,i saw some replays
 dbdr: but I don't really do C++. the rust stdlib definitely has nice things in that regard
 MSmits: the heuristics not only prevent mistakes, but also reduce branching in whatever search you are using
 MSmits: like, always open 1 length chains before anything else
 MSmits: always take 1 length chains when they are offered
 MSmits: same for 2 length, when 1 lengths are exhausted
 MSmits: only when those are gone does it get more complicated
 MSmits: your search will probably lead you to this same kind of play most of the time, but why waste time searching?
 MSmits: oh and always open a 2 chain by bisecting it, dont give the opponent a choice
 MSmits: he has to take both boxes then
 MSmits: that last one jrke, i saw you do wrong
 MSmits: you opened a 2 chain by giving dbdr the option of taking both boxes, or closing the chain at the other end and forcing you to take them
 MSmits: never give them more options
 jrke: its the bug im trying to fix from last few days Msmits
 MSmits: ohh ok, good
 MSmits: as Marchete said, you're doing great
 jaehwanspin: hey
 jaehwanspin: hey you
 Marchete: I won't do functional programming, I just use the ideas from that document
 Marchete: I think it's really comprehensive about different states, and so well written
 MadKnight: Marchete
 Marchete: so I'll go probably C++
 Marchete: MadKnight
 MadKnight: DM Marchete
 MSmits: I didn't know Marchete was into D&amp;D
 MSmits: oh direct message... I usually say PM
 Marchete: I'm just reading it, the strategy behind the game is interesting
 Marchete: in that sense yes, I'm into D&amp;B
 Marchete: but 0 code right now
 MSmits: I said D&amp;D, dungeons and dragons, because MadKnight said DungeonMaster
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: but thats ok :P
 Marchete: sorry :D
 Marchete: I played some RPG years ago
 Marchete: LOTR, and vampire:mascarade
 MSmits: I like D&amp;B too obviously, most of my free time last week was spending reading and re-reading papers
 MSmits: ahh cool
 MSmits: I play D&amp;D twice a year, over google meet now
 Illedan: Got any of them good papers?
 jrke: is fall in september?
 darkhorse64: Usually the 21st
 jrke: 21st&#160;??
 darkhorse64: Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2015/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2015-068.pdf">https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2015/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2015-068.pdf</a>
 MSmits: Illedan the best one for me is: PLAYING SIMPLE LOONY DOTS AND BOXES ENDGAMES OPTIMALLY.
 MSmits: but it's not introductory
 MSmits: you should read other things first
 MSmits: just googling will help you with those
 Illedan: Damn, 100 page paper
 Illedan: tldr? :D
 darkhorse64: Also: The Dots-and-Boxes Game: Sophisticated Child's Play book
 darkhorse64: 100+ pages
 darkhorse64: #3 without reading any of those&#160;? 
 Illedan: Basic heuristics..
 MSmits: i dont  particularly like that book darkhorse64
 MSmits: it's too focused on nimdots/nimstring
 MSmits: the exceptions to those rules can't be ignored
 darkhorse64: I am still at thet
 <b>**TorbenJauss hello</b></p><p><img src="/a/23496414257567" /> darkhorse64: the start.

 TorbenJauss: Was just trying the commands from help section&#160;;)
 Illedan: #testcommands &lt;=
 darkhorse64: TorbenJauss has discovered emojis. Pray that he does not find long lines
 Marchete: Msmits these kind of paper are so hard to read
 Marchete: hundreds of theorems and Corollaries
 Marchete: and 0 graphical examples
 Marchete: and I found 2 versions of that paper
 MSmits: oh, did you find a longer version of it?
 MSmits: illedan said 100 pages
 MSmits: oh right, there is a 20 page and 30 page version it seems. Nice!
 MSmits: I did not see the 30 page one before
 MSmits: more theorems yay!
 MSmits: nah it's just spaced out more and easier to read. Same paper
 MSmits: you don't need all the proofs with the lemma's and such. You just need the results
 MSmits: The results are not easy to read either, but it's doable
 MSmits: mostly it takes time to get used to all the symbols
 MSmits: like cv(G\4) = 4
 MSmits: means, the controlled value of Game G minus one 4 loop (there's a sub (l)  is equal to 4
 MSmits: controlled value means, the value of the game when you dont give up control during the entire playout of the endgame except that you take all boxes of the last object
 MSmits: cv = controlled value, v = actual value
 MSmits: anyways, i did have to read this one several time
 MSmits: I put all results from this paper in my solver already, but as I said, it only works for simple end games
 Marchete: I have like 13 papers about D&amp;B
 MadKnight: MSmits i was telling people that your smitsi uses a pretty bad approach
 Zenoscave: :popcorn:
 MSmits: MadKnight do you mean the algorithm in general or my implementation of it?
 Marchete: :popcorn:
 MadKnight: the algo in general
 MSmits: ahh ok, well it does what it does
 MSmits: with its pros and cons
 Marchete: come on
 MSmits: depending on the game the pros may outweigh the cons, or not
 MadKnight: nothing of that level Zenoscave it's just that his trees are independent and it creates a huge problem - your bot can't predict that the opp will change his moves depending on your previous moves
 MSmits: Marchete does fairly well with it in PCR
 Marchete: we want blood
 Marchete: I already showed a :popcorn:&#160;!
 Zenoscave: Right Marchete!?
 Marchete: yeah
 MSmits: MadKnight you are completely correct in what you say
 MadKnight: no blood today
 Zenoscave: damn
 MadKnight: fix it MSmits
 Zenoscave: dzpz
 MSmits: the question is not whether this problem is huge or not
 Zenoscave: ezpz
 Marchete: it was like: "your ideas suck!" and politely replied "OK"
 MSmits: the question is whether it is larger than the problem minimax has with the branching
 MSmits: and depth
 MSmits: smitsimax gets twice as deep
 MSmits: with the assumption of independent trees
 Marchete: top 4 PCR has 3/4 smitsimax
 MSmits: depth is important in CSB, because  just turning your pod around takes 10 turns
 Marchete: 3 out of 4
 Zenoscave: 10? I thought it was 6
 Marchete: the alternative is combining moves
 MSmits: 18 degrees = 1 turn
 Marchete: === jolindien_s way
 Marchete: on Xmas Rush
 MSmits: 180 degrees = 10 turns
 Zenoscave: the math works out
 Marchete: decoupled MCTS or whatever is called
 MSmits: yeah the branching is insane though
 Marchete: my main problem...
 MSmits: but xmas rush is really complicated to search. Anything that works is gonna be really messy
 Zenoscave: Marchete can you look at some GitC replays and see if you have any advice?
 Zenoscave: I'm close to legend but I think something crucial is missing
 MSmits: the winning part?
 MSmits: :p easy shot
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 MSmits: i suck at gitc anyway, gj
 MSmits: i quit at silver and someone boosted me to gold months later
 Zenoscave: I win 45% of Matches against Gold Boss
 Zenoscave: just need a little more...
 dbdr: a lucky submit
 dbdr: might be what you need
 Zenoscave: lucky submit got me .8 below
 MSmits: well possibly you might be able to push every player that wins over 55%+ vs you out of gold first
 dbdr: luckier submit then&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: I already pushed one.
 MSmits: you need a somewhat better bot yeah. Maybe some hardcoding? How random are these maps?
 Marchete: you need &gt;55% to be sure to pass
 Zenoscave: My INC strat needs work
 MSmits: I was able to get past gold boss in code royale by watching its play and improving its hardcoded strat just a little bit
 Marchete: it's tricky
 Marchete: I have coefficients
 Marchete: and just spam train until I win more
 Marchete: then as this wasn't enough
 Marchete: I made different map coefficients
 Zenoscave: how many maps are there?
 MSmits: i was just wondering whether they are randomly generated or not
 Zenoscave: I think limited random
 MSmits: maybe randomly generated and then hardcoded?
 Marchete: seed based
 MSmits: with thousands of possible maps or maybe 20 or so?
 Marchete: try GitC seed=673060485   &amp;&amp;  seed=844146682
 Marchete: it crashes the server
 Marchete: I know because I generated ALL possible maps
 Marchete: locally
 MSmits: how many?
 Marchete: seed=0 to 999999999
 MSmits: yeah ok, but duplicates?
 Zenoscave: ^ this
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: two different seeds give the same map maybe
 Marchete: I got stats
 Marchete: probably
 MSmits: also there could be symmetries
 MSmits: which makes maps equivalent
 MSmits: even if they are not exactly the same in input
 Zenoscave: I think the equivalency of maps isn't an issue
 Marchete: there was an special case
 Marchete: rush maps
 Marchete: were bases are really near
 Zenoscave: Sometimes the boss stops sending troops from a few bases to save up for INC. if I can figure out when it's safe to do that I'm sure i've got legend
 Marchete: I have my stats here, I got these values from maps: FactoryCount;TotProd;InitialTroops;DistanceBases;Count;SampleSeed
 Zenoscave: just cant figure out the conditions for when it's safe
 Marchete: GitC is 80% the first turns
 Marchete: not a complete GG but really important
 Zenoscave: seed=603912519Can I get a replay of yours against me on this map?
 Marchete: if you have doubts about how to improve, just pick a replay and use another one's bot, and press play
 Marchete: to see the differences
 Marchete: mainly in the first turns + bombs
 Zenoscave: ok I'll play around with it
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/484386690">https://www.codingame.com/replay/484386690</a>
 Marchete: and after that play a game with seed=673060485  :D
 Zenoscave: Internal error. I saw already haha
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/484387879">https://www.codingame.com/replay/484387879</a>
 Zenoscave: Seems I should try harder to recover stopped enemy factories
 Marchete: why 13 to 6?
 Marchete: it seems you bot prefer longer jumps in some cases
 Marchete: and usually the center factory
 Zenoscave: what was the other option?
 Marchete: going thru the center
 Zenoscave: let me see...
 Zenoscave: Ah yes my Floyd-Warshall doesn't add 1 for hops. never got that working
 Zenoscave: Well, I got it working but it does worse
 Marchete: here I played a better bomb at turn=0 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484388849">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/484388849</a>
 Marchete: you send 1 and 3
 Marchete: I went 6 and 5
 Marchete: I bombed "my factory" 5 because I knew it was a lvl3, nearer to yours
 Zenoscave: Yeah I think I can fix bombs by looking for opponent score rather than -my score
 Marchete: as I said I have several coeffs for different actions
 Marchete: attack, INC, defense, etc
 Marchete: I realized the map space is huge, 1 billion different maps, but some similarities, so I get some samples of them, like 100
 Marchete: and trained to win more
 Zenoscave: ok thanks. I've got enough to work with I think
 Marchete: :D
 Marchete: ok then&#160;:(
 Marchete: so some points are
 Marchete: jumps are important
 Marchete: scoring of actions are important: when to defend, when to inc, attack, etc
 Marchete: bombs are important
 Marchete: 90% of the game are the first turns
 Marchete: after some few turns it stalls or someone snowball
 Marchete: few I don't know, maybe 20 or 25
 Zenoscave: Thank you so much!
 Zenoscave: this really should help
 MadKnight: &gt;  the question is whether it is larger than the problem minimax has with the branching it doesn't mean u shouldn't fix it MSmits
 MadKnight: MSmits u there&#160;?
 dbdr: MadKnight: [...] fix it [...]
 eulerscheZahl: didn't thibaud plan to remove his moderating powers?
 eulerscheZahl: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/chat-moderation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/chat-moderation</a>
 Marchete: :D
 Zenoscave: :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: MK can you still kick me?as I have that mod icon on every chat but can't kick on #ru
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't intend to start a fight, put back your popcorn
 Marchete: :popcorn:
 Zenoscave: *puts away popcorn
 Marchete: too late
 JBM: :ice_cream:
 Marchete: it's already "out"
 JBM: :soda:
 Marchete: btw euler, no Dots and Boxes for you?
 Zenoscave: I prefer Drum and Bass
 eulerscheZahl: didn't feel like it, i'm not that much into board games
 eulerscheZahl: and less motivated to code bots while coding at work too&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i miss my days as a student
 dbdr: we need professional CodinGamers
 Marchete: you did a lot 
 Marchete: of bots while working
 Marchete: but yeah, I feel the same usually
 Marchete: too much coding at work == less at CG
 Aravindhsiva: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/13588657f362229f43153377f38f76a05c67d01">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/13588657f362229f43153377f38f76a05c67d01</a>
 Aravindhsiva: Anyone can join
 eulerscheZahl: well, for board games i'm less motivated
 eulerscheZahl: feels too much the same to me. fast sim + opening books
 eulerscheZahl: sure, you still need some scoring too
 dbdr: D&amp;B is deep
 eulerscheZahl: but the part that's written for this specific bot and not reusable is smaller
 eulerscheZahl: ok, i'm still not into it then :D
 eulerscheZahl: maybe if i would try to write a basic bot first. but can't motivate myself to take the first step
 <b>**eulerscheZahl wants a contest</b></p><p><img src="/a/43448306132121" /> dbdr: what's happening with your game?
 eulerscheZahl: in review
 Marchete: D&amp;B has little opening books afaik
 Marchete: and it seems more about gamestate evaluation
 Marchete: rather than brute force
 Marchete: but probably will be on the future
 dbdr: yeah, d&amp;b does not seem bookable
 dbdr: unless you want to exploit specific deterministic opponents
 eulerscheZahl: well, the initial setup is always the same and the board is small
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand i don't think breakthrough is a good candidate for an opening book, so you might be right
 dbdr: 110 first moves or so
 dbdr: well less with symmetry, but still huge
 eulerscheZahl: UTTT has 81 first moves. yet the center is what everyone does
 dbdr: center is quite clearly special and better
 dbdr: nothing like that here
 dbdr: partly because it does not matter who played a move
 dbdr: just if has been played or not
 MSmits: 112 first moves, without doing rotations and mirror symmetry you can cancel 4 corner moves for being equivalent. Or you can just do the symmetry thing and arrive at 14 starting moves. 
 eulerscheZahl: will you try to make a book?
 MSmits: I;ll be happy if i even get a working bot but sure, I'll make one eventually I guess. Not really to counter any specific player, but just to get a reasonable start. Probably just for 5 plies or so
 MSmits: this game has about the same gamestate complexity as games like Othello, UTTT, yavalath etc.
 MSmits: but the gametree complexity is much greater
 MSmits: from which it follows that it has lots and lots of transpositions
 reCurse: I propose the Smits Law in CG game design: every game should start from a random state.
 reCurse: should = must
 reCurse: Poor law otherwise
 MSmits: not a bad idea&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: how many games do y'all run before confident int win%? 100? 1,000? 10,000?
 reCurse: You said it, use a confidence interval
 reCurse: Number of games depends on winrate
 mr.mister: How do you get those stars? The ones shown in a modal when you hover over someone's avatar in clash?
 Zenoscave: Fair enough
 Zenoscave: There's stars?
 MSmits: Zenoscave your map sample must be good too
 MSmits: fixed opponent can also be bad
 MSmits: sometimes you win 100% and then you check the games and they are all identical, which means the test is about as useful as a test with N =1
 MSmits: with random maps thats less likely
 Zenoscave: I have random maps. But that makes sense yeah
 MSmits: this is also why reCurse is right about his random start suggestion. Not just to prevent opening books, but to also to more easily test your bot and not get overfitted too quickly

 jacek: :v
 PotatoCoder: yahoo im banned from discord
 PotatoCoder: discord server*
 jacek: achievent unlocked
 PotatoCoder: yea an opinion was too much
 eulerscheZahl: because of the capchas question?
 eulerscheZahl: i just decided to ignore you, a kick or ban seems harsh
 eulerscheZahl: (maybe i missed the end if the discussion, don't know if there was anything else that followed)
 PotatoCoder: yea well i kinda trolled a mod and he probably banned me
 Zenoscave: And you're surprised because?
 PotatoCoder: becauce its a ban
 PotatoCoder: not even a warning
 Zenoscave: did you need a warning to know not to?
 PotatoCoder: yea well do you shoot somebody if they make something bad
 eulerscheZahl: Warning, Kick, Ban: notify the abuser with a public warning first, then kick if necessary, then ban if necessary<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/chat-moderation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/chat-moderation</a>
 VCODER_17: hey
 VCODER_17: does anyone know how to remove this chat window&#160;? 
 VCODER_17: from the right side of my computer screen  ?
 eulerscheZahl: append this to the URL:?disableChat
 eulerscheZahl: triangle at the bottom of the chat to just collapse it
 PotatoCoder: document.getElementById("chat").parentNode.remove(); putting this to userscript removes chat
 eulerscheZahl: but you way get the chat back at certain actions like entering the IDE. with ?disableChat it remains hidden
 MSmits: reCursev andaag om 19:52Great, someone banned the other guy and deleted all messages, so the conversation makes no sense.
 PotatoCoder: i just noticed "Invite me to Clash, earn a free ban!" Power Tripping much?
 MSmits: this was you PotatoCoder?
 PotatoCoder: haha
 PotatoCoder: yes
 MSmits: not trying to get you banned here too, but, just out of curiosity, what was the subject?
 reCurse: That's a joke in case the obvious needs to be told
 reCurse: And I didn't ban you, what's the last message you typed?
 reCurse: Don't lie
 MSmits: uh oh, seems I moved the problem here, sry&#160;:(
 PotatoCoder: "Error: The user is banned from this guild."
 MSmits: guild?
 reCurse: You typed a message before another mod proceeded to ban you
 MSmits: he banned you from world of warcraft?
 reCurse: I didn't see it
 reCurse: What was it
 PotatoCoder:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: what did you write to get banned?
 eulerscheZahl: i was wondering the same
 MSmits: it's a trap PotatoCoder
 reCurse: Can you stop trolling for a sec MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: i just saw you complaining about the CoC captchas. was there anything else?
 jacek: he said 3 3 is best opening move for Y
 MSmits: fine fine
 MSmits: wait what jacek? What a noob
 PotatoCoder: i typed "yea pretty cringe maybe we should ban everyone" and reCurse replied something like "whats your point" and i removed my message and got banned
 reCurse: No you typed another message
 reCurse: It got deleted and you got banned right after
 reCurse: What was it
 PotatoCoder: bruh i didint send any message 
 PotatoCoder: only remove
 eulerscheZahl: how do you even know that and who did the ban reCurse? are there logs which just don't show the actual message?
 reCurse: There are logs but they don't show deleted messages because Discord is sometimes terrible
 MSmits: but how do you know he said something then reCurse?
 MSmits: or did it just say he was "typing"
 MSmits: cuz that might have been deletion activity
 reCurse: I'd just find it weird he chose to delete 1 message then ban after, so I'm checking
 MSmits: I'm still wondering why the ban
 eulerscheZahl: we all are
 MSmits: bad language or just general unproductive conversation?
 reCurse: Doing due diligence here
 reCurse: I revoked the ban but behave a bit more
 reCurse: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: :thumbsup:
 PotatoCoder: ok thanks
 eulerscheZahl: out of curiosity: can I revoke bans too or just you as the server owner?
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: server owner??
 eulerscheZahl: reCurse is the one who set up the CG discord
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: I was wondering maybe recurse bought up CG when I wasnt paying attention
 eulerscheZahl: even got an honorable mention in a newsletter
 reCurse: Most people didn't see the point at the time but I set it up anyway
 MSmits: ah ok, i dont always read those
 reCurse: Because webchat is terrible
 reCurse: Unfortunately most people disagree
 MSmits: i dont disagree
 MSmits: this chat is terrible, but it's connected to the site
 eulerscheZahl: i like the webchat more
 Zenoscave: I don't not agree
 MSmits: new people come here
 MSmits: so this is where we welcome them
 MSmits: if we all move over to discord, this dies and CG suffers I think
 eulerscheZahl: mainly because it's directly integrated in the website and not a 3rd party
 reCurse: eulerscheZahl Unbans need admin rights so me and Thibaud
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 MSmits: is there any way to directly integrate discord into a website?
 MSmits: a channel i mean
 eulerscheZahl: i also tend to have a look at user profiles when they are stuck at a given game and find a replay.on discord they don't always use the same nickname
 Zenoscave: I doubt it MSmits
 MSmits: would be a nice service
 reCurse: Discord is kind of a package deal so embedding is not in their features
 MSmits: ah
 reCurse: Halite didn't need site integration at all and the Discord was very active
 eulerscheZahl: at least they show more history than the 10k messages we had on slack
 reCurse: People just get used to one thing and refuse to budge after
 reCurse: True for many things
 Zenoscave: mmmm QWERTY 
 MSmits: you're right to a point, but how do you get new players to the discord chat
 MSmits: they start talking here because the chat window just pops up at lvl 3
 reCurse: Just kill the webchat. Controversial I know.
 MSmits: it's extremely accessible
 eulerscheZahl: hosting question: is that all on discord servers or do you have to provide your own server for this?if it's the first I don't see what's the deal about setting it up
 reCurse: All on discord cloud
 reCurse: "Package deal" as in the platform is the product they offer.
 eulerscheZahl: for free or paid for a server of that scale?
 reCurse: Always free, so you're the product
 reCurse: How I'm not sure yet, maybe they're still sucking at the teat of VC money
 eulerscheZahl: i can get discord nitro for more emojis :D
 MSmits: :frog:
 eulerscheZahl: totally a selling point for meNOT
 MSmits: I'd like to report a :bug:
 MSmits: this :beetle: is actually a ladybug
 eulerscheZahl: i see a mushroom
 eulerscheZahl: with some biteouts
 MSmits: the dots are black :P
 eulerscheZahl: like the chat
 MSmits: look it up in the emote selection window, with white background it looks ok 
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNTBEcoW4AAZJcV.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DNTBEcoW4AAZJcV.jpg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: (they fixed it now afaik)
 MSmits: the piss beer?
 eulerscheZahl: hover foam
 MSmits: oh
 reCurse: Took me too long to notice
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737066/google-burger-beer-emoji-android-8-1-fix-release-date">https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16737066/google-burger-beer-emoji-android-8-1-fix-release-date</a>
 MSmits: people get too emotional over emotes 
 PotatoCoder: emotion is too relatable tbh
 eulerscheZahl: even goes so far as to bundle new emojis with security updates so more users install them
 MSmits: pretty :sick:
 reCurse: That doesn't sound true
 eulerscheZahl: now i have to find a source&#160;:/
 MSmits: or just make it sound better
 MSmits: spice it up a little
 reCurse: I'd like to think we're not at the stage where we're doing A/B testing for security updates using new emojis
 eulerscheZahl: The update includes more than 70 new emojis and a much-needed security update that patches the KRACK Wi-Fi exploit.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ios-11-1-software-iphone-x-8-8-plus-emojis-apple-watch-watchos/">https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ios-11-1-software-iphone-x-8-8-plus-emojis-apple-watch-watchos/</a>
 reCurse: Yeah sure but isn't that just part of the update rather than the reason?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it helps to get more users into installing it. but i don't think i can find an official reasoning. so this point goes to you
 eulerscheZahl: i hereby revoke my claims
 reCurse: Besides I don't know how it is on Apple but Android is pretty aggressive on getting you to update
 reCurse: I don't think you need incentive when there's basically no choice
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have a mobile phone, so i can't tell
 reCurse: :o
 eulerscheZahl: either i'm home or you have to wait, that simple :P
 reCurse: I can see the point about communication
 reCurse: But it's still very useful without
 eulerscheZahl: some friends get annoyed by it
 reCurse: I'm not great at finding places so integrated GPS is really useful, etc
 eulerscheZahl: and more and more websites require 2 factor authentication, i'm slowly getting locked out
 MSmits: ahh right not many people like you and me euler
 MSmits: I get :poop: about not having a mobile phone every day at work
 MSmits: I use tokens for 2 factor
 MSmits: also, if you use google or microsoft authentication, you can use a machine for it, instead of a phone number
 MSmits: i can log in using my laptop
 MSmits: i use that for some sites also
 MSmits: there's usually a way around it
 MSmits: (having a mobile phone)
 MSmits: I feel if they want me to have one they need to give me one
 eulerscheZahl: can have unpleasant surprises.e.g. you want to log in to your google account on another computer away from home. and it doesn't let you as there is some IP history and they figure it might be an intruder
 MSmits: that's true
 MSmits: btw, the 2 factor thing is actually tied to the machine, so to log in from a different computer, i need to have the laptop with me
 MSmits: just to get the code
 MSmits: at least that is how i understand it works
 MSmits: otherwise it wouldn't really be 2-factor
 MSmits: that way they also dont have to worry about the IP thing
 MSmits: because you have to have the machine with you...
 MSmits: try search for google + authenticator + laptop if you want
 eulerscheZahl: nah, too tired
 eulerscheZahl: going to bed soon
 MSmits: ahh yes
 eulerscheZahl: getting winter again :D
 MSmits: what are you working on on CG atm?
 MSmits: yeah that it is
 eulerscheZahl: no, still waiting for CG to review my game
 MSmits: so just chillin'&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: ah k
 MSmits: could do some dots
 MSmits: and some boxes
 MSmits: I hear you're good with the boxes
 eulerscheZahl: played soccer earlier todayi'm always tired after
 eulerscheZahl: and that's another board game, meh
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense
 MSmits: maybe code a skin that make the boxes do exploding fireworks when you capture them
 MSmits: but I get your point, you like more complicated game mechanics
 MSmits: strategy wise D&amp;B is very complicated though, but very mathy, not sure you like that
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure either
 eulerscheZahl: and recently i'm mostly playing contests anyways
 eulerscheZahl: going to bed now, cat is waiting :D
 MSmits: yes, dont keep the :Cat: waiting
 MSmits: :cat
 MSmits: :cat:
 MSmits: seems i am tired too
 MSmits: gn!

 MadKnight: MSmits u still there&#160;?

 jacek: how may we help you, Sir/Madam
 MadKnight: i'd like to talk about our lord and saviour, Decoupled MCTS
 jacek: smitsimax?
 MadKnight: nop
 MadKnight: smitsi is just MCTS[]
 MadKnight: MCTS[nAgents]
 jacek: not for simultaneous games?
 MadKnight: for them
 MadKnight: both these things are for simultaneous games
 jacek: welp never did anything for simul games anyway
 MadKnight: smitsi basically runs a separate MCTS per agent and runs the exploration thingy in parallel
 MadKnight: and Decoupled MCTS has moves for all the agents in 1 node
 MadKnight: instead of just 1 agent
 Scarfield: hi maddy&#160;:) long time no see maddy
 JBM: we missed u
 JBM: what's the current alg brand name
 MadKnight: wat?
 JBM: MadKsimax?
 reCurse: Wasn't that already talked about a while ago during the whole "smitsimax" craze?
 jacek: try jacekmax
 MadKnight: yea but i'm just explaining this stuff to jacek
 reCurse: What was that again
 jacek: instant win for all games
 reCurse: Namely?
 MadKnight: jacek what if u play jacekmax against jacekmax?

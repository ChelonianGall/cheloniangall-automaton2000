 WizardAesthetics: I got to 90% how did you guys get around not hard coding?
 MadKnight: hey Zenoscave 
 Zenoscave: hey MadKnight
 MadKnight: are u in legend&#160;?
 Zenoscave: yup
 MadKnight: noice
 Zenoscave: thx
 MadKnight: what's your strategy now&#160;?
 Zenoscave: same as the rest of gold but i optimized well
 MadKnight: how did u optimize it&#160;?
 Zenoscave: dfs 
 Zenoscave: movement choice is important
 Zenoscave: and when to torpedo is as well
 Zenoscave: when/where
 MadKnight: nice
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Zenoscave: happy pre caturday
 Riyuk: Hey MadKnight
 aCat: :D
 Riyuk: Guys, Is there any interesting course/book on AI that you would recommend?
 Riyuk: AI/ Algorithms!
 MadKnight: hey Riyuk
 Riyuk: :wave_tone2:
 MadKnight: just make a GA
 MadKnight: Riyuk
 Riyuk: Any puzzle to do that? MadKnight
 Riyuk: to begin
 MadKnight: CSB ofc
 MadKnight: lol

 rwilson: Riyuk - might look at "Artificial Intelligence" by George F Luger .. maybe newer versions?  was good for me, but there are likely more 'fun' books out there...  
 Riyuk: Thanks MadKnight and rwilson
 rwilson: ... if you want less 'formal' an a bit more fun -- really take a hard look at Udacity courses
 rwilson: .. i'm sure there are good ones on Udemy, but i've taken several Udacity &amp; they're nicely put together. ( bit of a price premium though for what feels like only 20 to 30% higher quality than Udemy in many cases though... so do your research.
 aCat: there are some free coursera AI videos on youtube
 aCat: I mean made by Stanford
 Riyuk: Sounds nice
 rwilson:&#160;;) in this day &amp; age, virtually all knowledge is free -- if you have the time to go find it...  ;) 
 Riyuk: I'll go check all that before picking one
 Riyuk: That's the thing, there is a lot of items
 Riyuk: the concern is more to choose the right ones&#160;:)
 rwilson:&#160;;) if you got time... you tube.. if you dont',   start lookign at Stanford free stuff, then Udemy courses ( when on sale ) and then Udacity ... ( that's, free -&gt; $$ -&gt; $$$$  )
 Raul17: Hey guys, where to check for the answers which i'm not able to solve in clash of code?
 eulerscheZahl: there is no way. you can just search for the clash to try it again
 AlimDursun21: hello guys, I wanna learn  programming with javascript . Who is help me about this topic? 
 eulerscheZahl: google
 AlimDursun21: thanks for suggestions:grinning:
 mikeNIN: also <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-ai-2">https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-ai-2</a>
 eulerscheZahl: not even trolling. learning how to search is a key competence for a programmer
 rwilson: ^ too true ( but becoming a key competency for a lot of tech fields these days ...  outsourcing our brains has become second nature )
 eulerscheZahl: and tech is evolving so fast. impossible to know everything. so looking things up is part of my daily work
 rwilson:&#160;:( 40 tabs of various searches open .. right now ..   while working on bot ...    a mild evening of refreshing memory ... 
 eulerscheZahl: sounds familiar
 cegprakash: when I want to get into Bronze but my friends call me to play AOE&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: real friends would understand that CG is more important
 eulerscheZahl: but instead of using your CG time to play the game, you spend it chatting
 eulerscheZahl: just like me
 18o3: you play AOE
 marshadow9: how is everybody??
 semera: Hi, codingame framework? When I start Ocean of Code simulation from captainsonar-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat-tests.jar my  debug informations are not in debug output. How to get my error/debug output?
 eulerscheZahl: from the local webserver or the json file
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://localhost:8888/test.html">http://localhost:8888/test.html</a>
 semera: I am not starting web server, just simulation
 semera: ok, hope have it, GameRunner.java returns GameResult
 eulerscheZahl: i know. but has it error streams?
 eulerscheZahl: never tried to get them
 IjustKilledutoo: hello
 IjustKilledutoo: it's me
 Nerchio: hello
 Nerchio: its me
 thibpat: hello everyone! I'm streaming again some more Ocean of Code! Most likely the last time to improve my bot <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 semera: ok, tested, errors are there
 AntiSquid: maybe i should play rust next contest since then people can't optimize vs me :D
 struct: you can even add if else
 struct: if its in ide timeout
 struct: else play
 AntiSquid: lame @_@
 AntiSquid: is that what Mr PonyPonyCodeCode does?
 PonyPonyCodeCode: nop, I timeout only because my code is too slow in debug
 yuushimizu: hi
 AntiSquid: hi, get an avatar
 eulerscheZahl: hi, get a promotion
 AntiSquid: don't really care
 wolf-555: hey guys does this site have bit manipulation questions&#160;? am new here
 tobk: what's a manipulation question?

 lxnn: Hey, can anyone answer this question: in 'Ocean of Code', what do the 'cooldown' values mean?
 Uljahn: charges needed to use a system
 darkhorse64: number of charges remaining before being operational
 lxnn: Ah right. Thanks!
 lxnn: Seems like a bit of a mixed metaphor 
 lxnn: cooling down vs charging up
 tobk: note that it's a bit confusing that in the UI, e.g. the torpedo is ready when there are three dots, but in the input, it is ready when you have a zero cooldown
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: i gave up trying to use cooldown so
 Nerchio: i have my own tracking for powers xD
 tobk: finally integrated mines into my fatality-code. nice combo: SURFACE | TRIGGER 8 0 | MOVE N SILENCE | SILENCE W 3 | TORPEDO 7 1
 lxnn: seems sensible to track powers yourself, because they could change between commands (i.e. they're not the same throughout your turn)
 lxnn: I suppose the provided values could be used for validation
 LyVanBong: hi everyone
 tobk: I update my cooldowns while preparing my turn, but in between turns, I rely on the inputs provided
 lxnn: hi LyVanBong
 Febrin: Fast question, can you put mines on island?
 NormantasStankevicius: no
 Febrin: Thanks
 MSmits: just land mines I think
 MSmits: legend feature
 Nerchio: lol
 Nerchio: MSmits are you in legend already
 Nerchio: You gave me a lot of trouble in gold :P
 eulerscheZahl: top gold
 eulerscheZahl: 7th including the boss
 AntiSquid: all about who gets pushed and how
 eulerscheZahl: i see it coming, he will make be cry again
 MSmits: you're more confident than I am euler, very little time left
 eulerscheZahl: you always get what you want
 MSmits: I was at 2nd 3 times yesterday, think it was luck
 MSmits: usually, not always 
 eulerscheZahl: i have no doubt that you will reach legend in the end if you try
 MSmits: but we'll see, I am trying to code self tracking now. Have to recode it because my other code is too bloated to reuse as selftracking
 MSmits: is it bad if i ignore mines on selftracking?
 eulerscheZahl: i check for blasts in self-tracking. but don't go back all the way to check if a mine can be there
 MSmits: yes blasts i do
 MSmits: i dont blast myself except on fatality, so thats easy, only need to check opponent actions for that
 eulerscheZahl: somehow it was worse for me with full mine tracking on myself. not sure if i screwed up implementation or if other bots have bad tracking
 YannT: your triggers can be very revealing so if you wanna do self tracking proper your might wanna have that in&#160;;)
 MSmits: not enough time though yannt, this is basically my last full day to get out of gold
 MSmits: i need a small boost is all
 Nerchio: submit submit submit :D
 eulerscheZahl: i even have a likeliness in tracking: it's possible that the opponent shoots himself. but unlikely. so i try to find a path without first. if none remaining, i allow self-shooting
 YannT: do you prioritize shooting before moving whenever applicable?
 YannT: that's a small boost right there&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes i do
 eulerscheZahl: because shoot-&gt;move can recharge your torpedo
 YannT: yes, often games are decided by just one torpedo charge in the end
 MSmits: my problem is mainly that i dont use silence intelligently at all and also dont move to avoid being tracked
 MSmits: also I think I need to improve my mine laying. Right now I just try to cover the map, but it's better to lay mines in places that the opponent hasnt visited isnt it?
 YannT: self tracking is what allows you to assign value to your silences
 MSmits: yeah
 pb4: MSmits&#160;: I have a dumb mine laying method just like you have
 lxnn: has anyone tried using a histogram filter for the tracking?
 YannT: yeah I didn't do anything fancy with mines either
 MSmits: ok pb4, but what if you do a "visited probability" function that calculates where the opponent likely has visited and then prefer cells that have a blast range on unvisited cells?
 pb4: Nope
 pb4: My only logic is to have at least 3 new cells covered by the mine I lay
 MSmits: currently i disallow any overlap between mine blasts, probably a bad call
 MSmits: but it makes me do more silence
 pb4: You'll have charge a new mine by the time you've moved anywhere else
 pb4: charged*
 eulerscheZahl: now good is your opponent tracking?say the opponent knows where you are and you are on a possible mine of your opponent but the opponent doesn't trigger.then it seems there is no mine at all.
 eulerscheZahl: do you handle that to eliminate paths?
 MSmits: no
 pb4: speaking to me&#160;?
 MSmits: it's dangerous
 eulerscheZahl: yes, pb
 MSmits: you might be wrong, some people trick you
 pb4: It's on the todo
 pb4: same with torpedoes
 YannT: seems risky
 Nerchio: damn when you submit and you don't move from 50th place
 Nerchio: feelsbad
 eulerscheZahl: he can't shoot you if you are out of range
 pb4: also this would only apply to the rare case where I'm right over the mine
 YannT: that will have you make possibly wrong assumptions about the opponent's estimation of value and if you're wrong you'll loose tracking
 pb4: If I'm in the 1 damage area, he could try to wait for me to walk over the 2dmg area
 pb4: YannT&#160;: "lose tracking" --&gt; that's a no for me
 pb4: I have two trackers
 pb4: tracker with assumption 
 pb4: tracker without assumption
 Quidome: OK, this was it. My new code is nice but way to slow. Have to back to the drawingboard for that and that is to much work for 2 days. :P
 YannT: that's smart
 pb4: if the tracker with assumptions loses tracking, I default to the tracker without assumptions
 Quidome: Good luck to you all, see you at the next contest :D
 eulerscheZahl: which is in less than a month already
 Quidome: :punch:
 eulerscheZahl: show some happiness
 Quidome: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 MSmits: wow... just my first test of bugged selftracking I see myself move in a large L-shape and reveal my location in like 10 turns
 MSmits: while gold boss makes a little square
 YannT: pb4: this is actually possibly the main reason I don't compete anymore when I think about iit... there's a lot of valid assumptions I thought of but decided against because it was too risky :o
 pb4: MSmits&#160;: how high are you without self tracking&#160;?
 MSmits: best rank was right below gold boss, did that 3 times
 pb4: YannT&#160;: a lot&#160;? I actually thought this was a useless feature in my bot -_-
 MSmits: I have 35% winrate vs gold boss
 MSmits: I think if i get this thing to work it should get me legend, just from seeing myself reveal my location so quickly without selftracking
 MSmits: probably i dont even need intelligent silence use, just picking the right move direction should do it
 YannT: pb4: seems like that would only ever make a positive difference wioth no negative impact, as long as the assumptions make sense
 lxnn: Question: do you think it's conceivably possible to do Q-learning in Python given the runtime constraints? I just started yesterday and need to decide how to use my time effectively.
 anid: Congrats on ur win Kovi
 YannT: I wouldn't be so sure&#160;;)
 Illedan: Long time left.
 Illedan: And winners get prizes too. Time to do some serious stuff
 YannT: is there tshirts?
 YannT: I thopught not
 Illedan: Thibaud said so yesterday
 YannT: oh yay
 YannT: seems like I'll get my first one then&#160;:)
 MSmits: SeriousStuff initiated
 Illedan: Indded
 YannT: plz don't kick me out of top20
 wlesavo: top 20?
 YannT: top20 gets tshirts usually&#160;:)
 wlesavo: wow
 YannT: I feel like I've finally deserved one on this contest
 YannT: oh yeah the contest poage has been updated!
 YannT: Are there any prizes to win?The 3 winners will receive a canvas of the contest artwork! Also 20 T-shirts will be awarded to the 20 top players in the Leaderboard!
 LikeUnkai: Skynet 2 has an issue. Test last "06 " failed only Submit session, all tests were success. why?
 eulerscheZahl: ah, they updated it indeed :o
 eulerscheZahl: was announced on discord yesterday evening
 eulerscheZahl: and i wrote again without reading all the chat
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: actually thinking more about it, it's difficult to implement the logic "I was there, he knew where I was, there can't be mines there" in my code
 pb4: I don't save mine positions, I save where the mine was laid
 eulerscheZahl: same. thought a bit about how to implement it, but i agree it's hard
 YannT: also my data structure doesn't easily let me iterate over possible mines :p
 eulerscheZahl: a bitboard
 YannT: yeah
 YannT: it's great and "is there possible a mine there" is super fast, but iterating over possible mines becomes like iterating over the entire grid&#160;:(
 YannT: still fast but meh
 eulerscheZahl: pb broken? got 3 wins vs him
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, definitely broken
 YannT: he's testing compiling stuff he said, times out a lot
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested him to submit a binary for testing
 pb4: Yup broken
 pb4: local compiling seems to timeout
 pb4: No idea why
 pb4: Not that interested in investigating
 eulerscheZahl: other compiler version, missing libs?
 eulerscheZahl: i remember we had to use a specific g++ version when i tried submitting a binary
 AntiSquid: eulerscheZahl see last frame:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/451820062">https://www.codingame.com/replay/451820062</a> it doesn't update the dots and i actually get in the input that i have 2 life not 1, so it's not just a visual bug
 eulerscheZahl: i dont see how that's not a visual bug
 eulerscheZahl: the opponent shoots a torpedo right at your location and you lose the remaining 2 lives
 eulerscheZahl: so you lose, last frame is missing
 eulerscheZahl: MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
 AntiSquid: check last frame ... i give out a command
 MSmits: Grrrr:   if (triggerX = posX &amp;&amp; triggerY == posY)
 MSmits: see the error?
 MSmits: c++ =/
 anid: first condition, number of =
 Astrobytes: triggerX = posX, classic
 eulerscheZahl: last frame output stream: TORPEDO 13 2 | MOVE N TORPEDO |SILENCE W 1 | MSG 1 ms
 MSmits: yep yep
 AntiSquid: ah looked at the wrong color ...&#160;:/
 Illedan: yeah..
 eulerscheZahl: because everything is shown as p1 in the summary below the viewer (known bug, reported on the forum)
 AntiSquid: i am not colorblind but i keep mixing up the orange and the red, that was the issue 
 AntiSquid: was thinking i am red
 AntiSquid: while looking at the correct sub 
 MSmits: finally my self tracking seems to work&#160;! Now to use the information...
 AntiSquid: how can you get mine tracking to work but have problems with self tracking?
 AntiSquid: i find mine tracking far more difficult
 MSmits: it's not that it's difficult, it's that I made such a major mess of my code, i cant just reuse opponent tracking. So I had to recode a slimmer version of my opponent tracking
 MSmits: and cause loads of new bugs =/
 AntiSquid: ah i had a mess too, maybe you should consider rewriting after contest
 MSmits: maybe I should consider never looking at it again :P
 MSmits: like I always do after contest
 MSmits: too much else to do
 MSmits: but you're right AntiSquid, mine tracking is hard
 MSmits: i did that 2 weeks ago so the pain has subsided
 idkhow2codee: Hi, does silence make path behind you when you move &gt;=2?
 iFightLegends: yeah
 iFightLegends: yeah
 idkhow2codee: oh k
 idkhow2codee: thanks
 MSmits: first game with functional move selection based on self-tracking:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/451851800">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/451851800</a>
 AntiSquid: replay the seed see if you win all the time
 AntiSquid: i get random wins vs boss too
 MSmits: i did the second time
 MSmits: my main point is: No more long L shape at the start. It makes a tighter shaper
 MSmits: shape
 AntiSquid: ya initially i thought everyone was hardcoding that movement lol
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: hopefully this is enough to beat the damn boss
 AntiSquid: who knows
 MSmits: i should say hopefully it actually helps, might be a fluke on this map
 AntiSquid: submit?
 MSmits: i did
 MSmits: hard to say
 MSmits: its going
 MSmits: also started CG bench
 MSmits: I like the start
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03fdf5bf-834d-4765-807b-2572f897fe09">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03fdf5bf-834d-4765-807b-2572f897fe09</a>
 AntiSquid: nice
 AntiSquid: everyone else seems to just shuffle the ladder and feed the boss :p
 MSmits: if I get a 50% + winrate vs boss,  I will spam the :poop:  out of it
 MSmits: push people into legend if they beat me, drop the boss if they dont
 Illedan: Nice plan
 MSmits: mehL
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8dbbb1a7-d9a1-4e42-8b90-2a7f27e35f9e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8dbbb1a7-d9a1-4e42-8b90-2a7f27e35f9e</a>
 MSmits: cheered too soon&#160;:)
 Illedan: :D
 AntiSquid: the mandatory loss streak
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: always baffles me to have a win streak and a loss streak, would expect more mixed results
 Nerchio: we didnt have any new person since 24 hours in legend
 Illedan: Let's keep it that way
 dbdr: humans are bad at expecting randomness
 eulerscheZahl: 50 is a good number
 Illedan: Let's make pb 4 the boss
 MSmits: it's a selection effect AntiSquid. You don't remember all the times you didnt get a streak
 dbdr: we see patterns where there is just noise
 AntiSquid: make pb the boss and reset legend
 Nerchio: so if the event finished now i would get a tshirt?
 Illedan: Or open SuperLegend
 Nerchio: #20
 Illedan: There is still a rerun Nerchio
 Illedan: Where you get 1000 or so new matches
 dbdr: above Legend is Mythical
 Nerchio: rerun?
 AntiSquid: ya Nerchio lucky submits won't help that much anymore, but they do help a bit
 Nerchio: so after timer finishes everyone in legend plays around 1000 matches or what
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: to stabilize
 AntiSquid: just rename legend to platinum / diamond and have legend above that, more like a moba
 eulerscheZahl: first all pending submits will finish. so you can in theory go all the way up from wood to legend
 eulerscheZahl: then the final rerun takes place
 AntiSquid: last second submit can still go wood to legend? woot lol
 eulerscheZahl: every player starts 500 matches on its own. so approx 1000 per player as you can be selected as an opponent
 eulerscheZahl: recalc only happens for min(100, legenLeagueSize) players
 AntiSquid: i forgot about that
 Swagboy: Hehe if someone in wood found the magic constant
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes it happens that we have to wait for one gold player to promote and climb up, delaying the whole rerun
 AntiSquid: you can still last minute submit bronze to legend
 eulerscheZahl: i can'trecurs e can
 AntiSquid: good win rate MSmits but you still so far from boss&#160;:/
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's not good enough, I am trying more things. I have the tracking, so I just have to use the information properly
 AntiSquid: use the Luke, force
 MSmits: I will use the Luke
 darkhorse64: Is there a way to see the gold boss level when you are legend&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea actually
 eulerscheZahl: yes, open a replay containing the boss
 eulerscheZahl: the score is shown below
 AntiSquid: why? are you worried big bad MSmits will come and wreck you?
 eulerscheZahl: there's another way using the in-game leaderboard for the specific league. but that's something for scripting, no simple manual way
 MSmits: look AntiSquid:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35c015ee-8e66-4e5a-9c8b-0681c142f748">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35c015ee-8e66-4e5a-9c8b-0681c142f748</a>
 MSmits: no streak
 eulerscheZahl: we don't fear AntiSquidwe accepted defeat the moment smits decided to play the contest instead of onitama
 MSmits: :P
 AntiSquid: maybe i should play community games instead of idling in chat :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: nah, chat is fine
 darkhorse64: I have achieved legend with no hope to win a tshirt. I have nothing to feat. Just interested in others effort
 eulerscheZahl: that dasies game reminds me of connect4just with a huge branching factor
 eulerscheZahl: same darkhorse64. i gave up
 MSmits: it's a strange game
 ZarthaxX: hi guys
 eulerscheZahl: minimum goal achieved, getting some rest before the next contest + codejam
 Nerchio: come on darkhorse you gave me a tough time in gold its time to fight in legend too :D
 ZarthaxX: darkhorse64 u quit?
 darkhorse64: Not yet for me. I am trying some marginal improvements in lack of a real strat
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl i remember you claiming a bot from march 31 would take 50-60 in the end of the contest, i guess you right in a way that you can only submit it in legend
 MSmits: huh, explain that
 ZarthaxX: wot
 MSmits: what is 50-60?
 wlesavo: #50-60
 ZarthaxX: position i guess
 darkhorse64: Unless a flood of people promote, this is going to be my best result ever
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: rank
 wlesavo: yes
 ZarthaxX: smitooooooooooo
 MSmits: yes Zarthy?
 ZarthaxX: heyo
 MSmits: hi
 ZarthaxX: school got you more busy than usual
 MSmits: mmh school and uttt
 MSmits: but not anymore, almost vacation
 ZarthaxX: oh u did uttt this month?
 MSmits: yep
 ZarthaxX: oh nice!
 ZarthaxX: so u kind of quit this one
 MSmits: I am trying to get to legend 
 MSmits: then i will quit
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: same feeling
 ZarthaxX: :P
 kovi: euler, you still have stats running?
 lxnn: Are any more game elements added after bronze league?
 ZarthaxX: no
 MSmits: no game rules, many different game strategies though
 eulerscheZahl: i admit my estimation was wrong wlesavo
 lxnn: oh ok, thanks. I was a bit confused because I got promoted automatically
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio do you have if else spaghetti?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have much experience for such long contests
 Nerchio: y
 ZarthaxX: wow..
 MSmits: patience you mean eulerscheZahl?
 ZarthaxX: congratz on that rank for first contest btw!
 Nerchio: ty
 MSmits: oh right, experience too
 ZarthaxX: really skilled spaghetti
 Nerchio: you dont have if spagheti/
 ZarthaxX: a mix
 MSmits: 2569 lines&#160;:(
 wlesavo: but still would be fun to submit it in gold
 ZarthaxX: but i suck at spaghetti
 MSmits: justy fyi, i worked on uttt for 2 years and it's 1400 lines
 ZarthaxX: are u first?
 Nerchio: whats utt
 MSmits: havent checked today
 ZarthaxX: ultimate tic tactoe
 MSmits: karlis o was gonna do something
 MSmits: but i was 1st yeah
 ZarthaxX: like tic tac toe but on steroids
 ZarthaxX: oh ok
 Nerchio: lol
 ZarthaxX: was?
 MSmits: maybe still, let me check
 ZarthaxX: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: :P
 darkhorse64: MSmits 51st&#160;?
 MSmits: I am currently above boss
 MSmits: but...
 ZarthaxX: :O
 MSmits: submit hasnt ended
 MSmits: hate that
 MSmits: will go back down i think
 MSmits: several losses
 ZarthaxX: this is the one smito
 ZarthaxX: :C
 MSmits: nah it;s shot, will try again :0
 lxnn: Can you lay a mine on the cell you're currently on?
 MSmits: still nr 1 uttt
 MSmits: ZarthaxX I did something tricky to beat karlis o
 MSmits: he's the only guy i cant beat without opening book
 MSmits: but he has one too
 darkhorse64: Overbooked karliso&#160;?
 MSmits: so i recorded his book and created my own book on top of it
 MSmits: 100% winrate :P
 ZarthaxX: ah ..
 MSmits: as p1 that is
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: u used his as a base
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 MSmits: yep
 ZarthaxX: kind of boring way of winning
 ZarthaxX: but fair
 MSmits: my bot is also very strong, i am not sure if it would be 1st if everyone removed their books
 MSmits: but it would be 2nd at least
 MSmits: so I have no choice but to counter any player with deep books. That is the way to go in the top 4 apparently
 kovi: it is definitely hard to climb today
 Illedan: No more autowin of pb 4? :P
 ZarthaxX: MSmits it's a fair play
 ZarthaxX: i just like games maybe where u cant do opening
 ZarthaxX: i like the idea of it tho
 wlesavo: that book war is facinating
 MSmits: ZarthaxX bandas then
 MSmits: you can create endgame books for bandas, but that is just to more efficiently solve.
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl did a good job on making onitama openingbook proof as well
 ZarthaxX: no opening?
 ZarthaxX: ah doesnt make sense right
 ZarthaxX: too many starts
 MSmits: like a million or more
 eulerscheZahl: not me, the game was always like that
 MSmits: onitama has less than bandas but still a lot
 MSmits: true...but it influenced your decision to pick it didnt it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and i saw nice animations at my inner eye
 MSmits: they sure are nice
 darkhorse64: If there is ever a chess game on CG, it shoud be the Fischer Random variant for this reason.
 MSmits: you dont really have to worry about opening book moves with chess
 eulerscheZahl: someone thought about adding chess in exactly that version. illedan?
 MSmits: there's a few useful ones, but other than that, the branching is so enormous, it is of limited use
 MSmits: checkers has more use for it
 Swagboy: There was final books however in previous state of the art
 Illedan: That project was put on hold :P
 Illedan: But the idea was to add with fischer random
 Illedan: But I like the idea of normal too
 Kukiss: Hello all,I have a grid with flagged areas in it and now I try to find the border cells of these areas. I am having hard times to ask a proper questions to google to look for some existing solutions. Do you maybe have any how to call it?
 Kukiss: any idea*
 MSmits: do you want a list of them or just a grid with the border cells flagged
 MSmits: I mean do you need to keep the relation ship with the center cell
 Matryza: path finding algorithms find the one u need
 Kukiss: well, I have already a mess. I have grids and I also store sets of coordindates. But a grid result would be better
 Kukiss: and, I do not need to keep the relationship with the center cell
 Nerchio: fun statistic
 tobk: How are the first opponents in a submit determined? I random selection from the entire pool? just had a boss fight as first battle and by bot was ~90th on last submit
 Nerchio: i start an if statement 362 times in my bot
 lxnn: Kukiss, if I understand you correctly, you have a region of cells, and you want to extract those cells that lie at the edge of that region?
 lxnn: And this is on ocean of code?
 Kukiss: lxnn yes, it is OoC and yes, your summary is correct
 tobk: get all cells in the set that have a neighbor that is not in the set
 lxnn: Ok, so surely it's just the cells that have at least one neighbour that is not inside the region
 lxnn: beat me to it tobk
 tobk: I love ses in Python. Use them extensively in all contests. e.g. to find the overlap of some blast area and possible opponent positions
 tobk: *ses=sets
 Kukiss: I store opponent's possible paths as sets + coordinates of last position and I wanted to filter it a little bit out with having only edge cordinates. But with this solution I miss information about the neighbors per each path.
 Kukiss: tobk Actually, I read second time what you wrote about sets there and it was exactly what I was missing. Thanks!
 Counterbalance: almost legend, MSmits, nice
 MSmits: yeah, it's a struggle to get there really. Not having much luck today even though i coded a lot of improvements I thought
 Counterbalance: My improvements are often worse aswell
 MSmits: mine arent even really worse. They are just major things and when i do a test, there's no change
 Counterbalance: same here, it's confusing
 eulerscheZahl: it's frustrating
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw, I too have succeeded in timing out myself with self tracking
 MSmits: using silence
 MSmits: that's when you know you're doin it right
 eulerscheZahl: we can do that too
 eulerscheZahl: just got one in the IDE while typing :D
 MSmits: lol gj
 darkstar: hello everyone
 MSmits: hi
 darkstar: new here, was wondering if anyone has give a go at "Shadows of the knight- ep 1"?
 ZarthaxX: it's a weird game where you code improvmenets and it doesnt work :D
 ZarthaxX: consistently
 MSmits: does it consistently not work or does it not consistently work?
 ZarthaxX: well lets say 50 50
 ZarthaxX: :P
 MSmits: lol ok
 Swagboy: Haha
 MSmits: darkstar almost everyone has
 MSmits: look up binary search, that's what you need
 darkstar: ok, thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: it's a 2D version of binary search btw, what you will find is most likely 1D
 MSmits: not that different, but still
 eulerscheZahl: you can do both dimensions independently
 MSmits: yeah i guess it is 2x 1D
 darkstar: i have been changing the bounds, dividing by 2 but still haven't gotten it to pass all the tests. I will start over
 MSmits: thats kind of how to do it, but there's many ways to make a mistake
 darkstar: yeah, i know xD
 MSmits: output your choices in error messages and see if they are correct
 darkstar: this channel is called world. Is it for all challenges or specific to what im trying to solve now?
 MSmits: maybe add some more messages for intermediate results
 MSmits: this is for all
 eulerscheZahl: general purpose chat
 darkstar: ok good to know, thanks
 MSmits: we are doing  a contest right now so thats what you'll be reading about, it ends on mondaymorning
 eulerscheZahl: right now it's mostly about the contest ending on monday
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 darkstar: oohhh, good luck&#160;!
 MSmits: thanks, the goal is to make eulerscheZahl flip again, but for a different reason :P
 ZarthaxX: invite eulerscheZahl to clash of code
 MSmits: yeah that seems like great fun until he decides to accept and whoop you
 MSmits: cuz you know he will
 Sneffy: Hi! I'm doing LoC&amp;M now and i wonder if someone has some time to help me finding a way to generate and test possibilites efficiently
 MSmits: did you read the post mortems?
 darkstar: flip as in flip out?
 MSmits: mine is pretty detailed I think
 MSmits: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: type /flip
 MSmits: as in flip the table over
 darkstar: haha
 Sneffy: Okey MSmits i'm gonna read it and see if i have some question thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: np
 Sneffy: At first i wanted to store a Move as as tructure that contain a type (int that represent if the mvoe is a summon, attack, or use) and then card pointer for source and target, is it too slow to work&#160;?
 MSmits: that kind of speed doesnt matter much in this game
 MSmits: you need speed in the sense that you dont consider duplicate moves
 MSmits: as in two move orders that lead to the same state
 MSmits: so if two creatures worktogether to kill something and there is no shield involved (whatever that bubble is called), then just consider one order between them
 MSmits: so if you do A attack C, then B attack C, dont consider B attack c, then A attack C
 MSmits: shield complicates this though, because when a creature is shielded, you need to attack with the low damage creature first
 Sneffy: sure
 MSmits: this sort of "using fixed order"  strategy to reduce branching also works on summoning and using green items (and red items to some degree)
 Sneffy: So i need first to generate all the possibles mobes
 Sneffy: moves*
 MSmits: if you can, you need pretty strict pruning. Also you need a way to deal with the tree for those rare instances where the branching is just too great
 Sneffy: and like take one, then regenerate the possible moves&#160;?
 MSmits: something like that
 Sneffy: because if i play one move, then it will remove some other possible moves or add new ones, like if i kill a guard
 MSmits: it is not an easy game though. if this is your first time doing  a tree-based search it is going to be rough
 Sneffy: so each time i choose a move i need to compute again
 MSmits: yeah
 Sneffy: I have tried tree search on csb but i stopped after not being able to make my blocker works 
 idkhow2codee: what are you guys talking about?
 MSmits: csb is also not an easy game to start doing tree search with
 MSmits: tron is easier
 MSmits: or any of the simple board games
 Sneffy: i've done it with bandas too but i have not enough performance to get to top
 MSmits: ahh dont worry about the top when you're still learning. Bandas top is really strong
 Sneffy: on csb move generation is somewhat easy because it's always the same ones
 MSmits: most of these simple board games have very strong top players
 Sneffy: but on loc&amp;m it seems tough
 MSmits: it is
 MSmits: do you use a fast language?
 Sneffy: c++ yea
 Sneffy: i've done it years ago in java but i wasn't good and i had like 3-4k sim per turn
 MSmits: ah ok, that helps for csb and those board games, however, it is a pain to use it on locam
 Sneffy: i had a basic monte carlo without tree
 Sneffy: just while(time) test random
 MSmits: ah ok, some top players had that too
 MSmits: it works ok
 MSmits: but better perfromance is important then
 Sneffy: Yeah
 Sneffy: so in a tree a node contain a whole turn&#160;?
 Sneffy: or each node is a move
 MSmits: depends on the game
 Sneffy: for loc&amp;m
 MSmits: in locam a node is a move
 MSmits: for me anyway
 Sneffy: okey
 Sneffy: I should maybe try without tree for now to get legend first
 MSmits: you can do that, but you'll still  need some kind of heuristics
 MSmits: I never wrote a heuristic bot for locam so i am not sure if it is hard
 Sneffy: you mean the evaluation for the board&#160;?
 Sneffy: or to prune moves
 MSmits: i mean if you use no tree
 Sneffy: i can like bruteforce
 MSmits: you need some rules to determine what moves to do
 MSmits: which cards to play etc.
 MSmits: my bot does this using a tree, if you dont use a tree, i dont know what else you would do
 MSmits: heuristics obviously, but that can get complicated also
 MSmits: I think I have a clear avantage over ooc gold boss now
 MSmits: but I need to get past the rest of the players :P
 MSmits: time for some submit spam maybe
 Sneffy: In your PM you speak about phase, like summon phase, then green item.. etc So in your node you have those phases&#160;? like while you can summon you only generate chil that summon&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah i have phases
 MSmits: some of them may repeat though
 MSmits: like i might have two summon phases
 Sneffy: yea i saw it
 Sneffy: but you also have a node that summon nothing&#160;?
 MSmits: oh hmm, yeah maybe i do
 Sneffy: like keep a card for later
 MSmits:  Iam not sure what happens if i have no creatures, i may create an empty node
 Sneffy: it would require to score the cards in your hand to not plays them each time you can
 MSmits: thats not important though, just do whatever works
 MSmits: sometimes making an empty node makes things simpler
 Sneffy: It wasn't like if you have no mosnter to play, but more if you have one spell and you prefer keeping it
 MSmits: ah yes, i have an option for not playing any spell 
 Sneffy: like it could improve the board state, next turn, but you still keep it because it could improve it more late
 MSmits: sure, yes, let me look it up
 Sneffy: and you need scoring the card in your hand to that your search keep it right&#160;?
 Sneffy: else it'd just "waste" like a red spell -7hp on a 2/2 monster
 MSmits: double EVAL_ITEM_USE_COST = 0.2;
 MSmits: I deduct points for using an item
 Sneffy: oh it it's constant for each item&#160;?
 MSmits: not sure, let me check
 MSmits: score -= itemUseCost * EVAL_ITEM_USE_COST;
 MSmits: so not constant
 Sneffy: ok that's what i thought nice
 Sneffy: i have much to do now haha
 MSmits: as long as it's fun&#160;:)
 Sneffy: yeah, i prefer doing games like loc&amp;m and csb as they are funnier but.. also harder
 MSmits: yes, csb is hard for a different reason though
 MSmits: it's very sensitive to eval and the physics is not easy to get perfect
 Sneffy: i found it kinda easy to get to top 20 legend
 Sneffy: but to get higher is way harder :p
 MSmits: with locam, eval doesnt seem to matter that much as long as it makes some sense
 Sneffy: i have a top30 genetic algorithm but with tree i couldn't acheive sames results&#160;:/
 MSmits: which algorithm?
 Sneffy: yours :p
 MSmits: for tree
 MSmits: oh, very few people have made it work for csb
 Sneffy: i mean with simple eval it works great for runner
 MSmits: Yeah that is what people tell me that try
 MSmits: my eval for csb is a mess, but it somehow works
 Sneffy: mine is too for my genetic 
 Sneffy: i have like 30 lines with plenty of if with angles and stuff
 MSmits: I never wrote a GA myself, I like SA, so I would probably try that first for a game where a hill climbing-type algo is needed
 Sneffy: I don't even know if my ga is "real" ga but well.. i have population and i do mutation and crossover haha
 Sneffy: but it's kinda bad for games like csb
 MSmits: did you use inoryy's csb starter for the GA? Seems most do
 Sneffy: First time yea but i changed a lot of things
 MSmits: btw GA was the meta for a long time with most people in top 10 csb using a GA
 Sneffy: reused the sim 
 MSmits: but you're right, it seems to me GA  *should* be bad for a game like csb
 MSmits: probably it was only at the top until someone had the courage to try a good minimax
 Sneffy: GA should be bad for every games with opponent that can alter you on purpose
 MSmits: its a bit iffy, because you need to discretize, something you dont have to do for GA
 Sneffy: pen, robostac,madknight, and others were already beating us easy at that time
 MSmits: true, the more interaction between the players, the worse GA should be. But my algoritm has that too
 MSmits: when was this Sneffy?
 Sneffy: like 3 years ago i think
 MSmits: oh wow, before I was on this site
 MSmits: before I could code a bot even&#160;:)
 Sneffy: and now you are 10* stronger than me hahaha
 MSmits: not feeling that strong right now, still failing in ooc gold :P
 Sneffy: well i stopped after getting wood 1 or 2 don't remember :p
 Sneffy: did not really like the game
 MSmits: I like it ok, but I wish i would just get legend and then I can quit :P
 YannT: it's a heuristic heavy game, maybe not your forte?&#160;;)
 Sneffy: I like heuristics, but this one is heavy on path and stuff
 MSmits: yeah that too
 MSmits: and the information game is huge in ooc
 MSmits: I am not used to that
 Sneffy: i'm gonna try to create my own multi soon i think
 MSmits: cool
 ZarthaxX: oh
 ZarthaxX: pog
 YannT: Sneffy: my pathing is actually the worse part of my bot, so it's not *that* important
 YannT: I still catch replays where it gets stuck on a shortish surface loop and stuff like that :p
 MSmits: ouch
 Sneffy: YannT yeah i see, but the tracking system too :p
 MSmits: just do a floodfill
 YannT: it's more involved than that tho
 YannT: I alter pathing to avoid mines, but can't apply mine detection during floodfilling (too heavy)
 YannT: so in very specific circumstances, it can enter a loop
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: I guess we all have these weaknesses
 YannT: and I have depth search too
 YannT: but if the loop is like 10-15 moves, that won't see it either&#160;:)
 YannT: it's alright, doesn't happen often
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: moar submit spam!
 YannT: mostly it does when the bot finds itself deep in the middle of a minefield, usually the game's lost anyway in that case
 MSmits: this is pretty clear right: 
 MSmits: -- TOTAL --    GW=57,41%    [ W=57,41%   L=42,59%   D=0,00%   ] [162 games]
 MSmits: 162 games vs boss
 YannT: I'd say so, since it's all vs. one bot, it should be pretty significative
 YannT: significant*
 MSmits: unfortunately I dont do superbly well vs the rest, so  i am going to have to push them into legend
 MSmits: before getting in there myself&#160;:
 Nerchio: lol
 Nerchio: how you get the stats
 MSmits: i just run games on cg benchmark, a tool
 MSmits: it basically runs IDE games automatically
 MSmits: with a time limit so as not to overload the cg servers
 MSmits: i try not to overuse it during contest
 MSmits: but i need it now&#160;:)
 Sneffy: Why not brutaltester MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: I need to know how it stacks up vs boss
 Sneffy: oh right
 MSmits: so unless someone gives me the boss source code, I cant&#160;:)
 MSmits: uh oh, horsey going up again
 MSmits: PonyPonyCodeCode
 Nerchio: how much points does boss have
 MSmits: 28.92
 MSmits: nr 2 and 3 both 28.02
 eulerscheZahl: 29.00
 Nerchio: 28.92 is pretty low
 Nerchio: it had up to 31 at certain points
 MSmits: it is, it just takes some luck for me to beat him
 Nerchio: i had same thats why i needed like 20 submits :D
 MSmits: right
 eulerscheZahl: 20 isn't much. some players got the 1000 submits in this contest already
 Nerchio: but i focused on getting my bot more consistent against people in mid gold
 Nerchio: so i could go for big winstreaks
 Nerchio: rather than boss itself
 MSmits: hm ok
 PonyPonyCodeCode: 432 submits here, but I can't really test my code in the IDE&#160;;-(
 Nerchio: same i write in the IDE but ctrl+c to codinggame
 MSmits: ahh Rust
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio not that lol
 ZarthaxX: rust timeouts when u click play my code
 Nerchio: ah really :D
 Nerchio: sounds like a pain
 ZarthaxX: everytime
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Nerchio: it's rusty so makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: Rust has release mode compilation in the arena but debug in the IDE
 AntiSquid: lol ladder just gets shuffledRaziel fingers crossed and you might promote
 MSmits: why cant they fix that eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: because it's a feature
 MSmits:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: release as it's significantly faster
 eulerscheZahl: debug to show you which part of your bot is broken
 anid: Wow Kovi
 anid: awesome!!
 eulerscheZahl: going up and down, he was there before
 eulerscheZahl: and then a resubmit 4 ranks below
 Nerchio: i won maybe 1 game vs kovi so far getting trashed all the time
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl shouldnt you be able to select what you want to compile it as? Like you can in c++
 kovi: yeah, top4-5 is still packed (val joined the branch)
 eulerscheZahl: you can MSmits? do you mean pragmas?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: does rust simply not allow the feature?
 eulerscheZahl: not the same and i don't know if Rust has something similar to this
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: you can do a trick in C# as well
 MSmits: but it never seemed to help much with me
 eulerscheZahl: call the program itself with runtime optim?
 MSmits: yeah I think that was it
 idkhow2codee: guys is it correct to name my boolean function as question e.g. bool IsCellFilled()?
 eulerscheZahl: still not the same as compile-time
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your language idkhow2codee
 idkhow2codee: c++
 eulerscheZahl: then i don't know about the uppercase I
 Nerchio: isCellFilled
 Nerchio: i would use
 eulerscheZahl: in C# that would be the way to do it, in Java you would write isCellFilled
 anid: Hes Far ahead now
 MSmits: I use C# style in C++ 
 MSmits: who cares :P
 eulerscheZahl: with I for interfaces?
 MSmits: there's a lot worse wrong with my c++ code than just style anyway
 MSmits: I never use an interface :P
 eulerscheZahl: illedan even uses that I in java :rage:
 idkhow2codee: but I don't care about case but about if I can name my function as question
 Nerchio: iScElLFiLlEdReTuRnTrUeIfTruE
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 idkhow2codee: xd
 MSmits: works&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: hi, this is Patrick
 anid: wht?
 MSmits: euler was hacked!
 Zenoscave: is this the krusty krab?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/xiqP6cT">https://imgur.com/gallery/xiqP6cT</a>
 eulerscheZahl: tHe WeIrD cAsInG somehow reminds me of patrick
 MSmits: ow
 MSmits: your brain is malfunctioning, this contest is too long
 eulerscheZahl: every contest is too long
 boinkus: choo choo
 MSmits: for you yeah, 2 days is optimal&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: A*Craft had a good duration
 MSmits: I was super stressed out 
 kovi: acraft was for tourist
 MSmits: would be enough for me now I think, assuming I dont have anything else on those 2 days
 kovi: even though im sure he spent only few hours
 MSmits: well I beat him on code a la mode so :P
 MSmits: slapped him around with my obfuscated 3k lines of code
 MSmits: (due to char limit)
 MSmits: pretty sure he just tried it and thought, fk this cooking, I am out :P
 icecream17: oh no! what did i do? how did it not save? i'm pretty sure i pressed play my code....
 Nerchio: use git
 MSmits: can always check submission history
 pb4: hey
 Zenoscave:   hi pb4
 MSmits: hi
 pb4: I'm printing a binary map which is easy to read in stderr from ide
 pb4: . and x just like the inputs
 pb4: however, in the stderr below a replay, the . and x don't have the same width
 pb4: --&gt; hard to read
 pb4: any suggestions on two characters which would have the same width below submit replays&#160;?
 Zenoscave: x and o?
 pb4: (also easily distinguishable)...
 Zenoscave: of . and |
 Zenoscave: verticle bar
 pb4: X and O are different widths
 pb4: I'll try the small versions
 Zenoscave: shame
 mlomb: the font is monospaced i
 mlomb: I think*
 Zenoscave: nope
 mlomb: the one in the debug output?
 pb4: in the replays
 pb4: not in the IDE
 mlomb: oh yes
 mlomb: thats sad&#160;:(
 skotz: i just dump .info_stderr { font-family: monospace; } in chrome dev tools&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: skotz with the real answers
 pb4: I'm going to like this&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_full-width_chars.html">http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_full-width_chars.html</a>
 pb4: Thanks for the suggestion skotz&#160;:)
 pb4: Do I have to do it every time I open chrome&#160;?
 pb4: Everytime I open a replay&#160;?
 Swagboy: 0 and 1 works well also pb4
 Zenoscave: Should be able to cache it somehow
 skotz: yeah... unless you have a live css editing plugin
 pb4: full width chars look gooooood&#160;:)
 pb4: It even makes the map a square
 Zenoscave: That's interesting
 mlomb: if you are using CGEnhancer you could throw a line there to apply the css autimatically
 Swagboy: Ah square map is a big +
 Swagboy: Even a big  □ 
 Zenoscave: new sub pb4?
 eulerscheZahl: new sub Zenoscave?
 pb4: Yup
 pb4: trying a new feature
 Zenoscave: always
 pb4: not working at the moment :D
 MSmits: above boss again.... probably temporary again
 icecream17: Somehow when submitting I always lose the 2nd game
 MSmits: your first submit are 10 games spread out over the ladder
 MSmits: likely your 2nd game is one of the better players
 MSmits: your first 10 games I mean
 MSmits: it's to make sure you dont have to travel all the way from the bottom to the top. They get you to your destination more quickly, especially if you're the best bot. 
 icecream17: I win 8/10. But so close, yet so far away from boss....
 MSmits: what do you mean 8 in 10?
 MSmits: on your first 10 games or overall?
 icecream17: yeah
 MSmits: or against boss specifically?
 MSmits: which is it?
 icecream17: 1st one
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well thats pretty good
 MSmits: usually means you end in the top 1/5th or so
 icecream17: The last day. Everyones submitting
 MSmits: not last day
 MSmits: tomorrow is the last full day
 MSmits: then some hours on monday
 MSmits: depending on your timezone
 icecream17: Oh. I forgot. (11:37 AM)
 MSmits: shit i finally did it
 MSmits: Legend :0
 kovi: grat
 Febrin: Yeey :d
 Febrin: That was a lot of effort, was it :D
 Swagboy: Gret
 Counterbalance: grats
 blasterpoard: cg
 MSmits: I just wore down the boss&#160;:)
 MSmits: attrition
 leojean890: gg
 Zenoscave: gz
 leojean890: yesterday you were so close MSmits.. you could just have been pushed in legend :P
 leojean890: 29 vs 29.3
 MSmits: I thought so but no, i think i was very lucky last night
 MSmits: after that i never got close until i verified my bot was better
 leojean890: I think that I won't succeed
 MSmits: it had 58% vs boss, my version last night had 35%
 leojean890: oh I see
 Febrin: Can you drop down to gold if you perfolm badly in legend, tho?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: once you're in, you're in
 leojean890: I've been on the gold top for 8 days
 leojean890: without succes ;o
 MSmits: do you have a fatality check?
 leojean890: yeah:P
 MSmits: self tracking?
 leojean890: yeah but not perfect I think
 leojean890: the damage taking into account
 MSmits: mine isnt either, i dont track my own mine triggers
 leojean890: same
 MSmits: i do track damage
 MSmits: and surface, sonar, torpedoes etc.
 leojean890: I track damage for enemy tracking
 leojean890: and everything
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: do you track mine triggers for opponent?
 leojean890: but for mine not damage nor mine trigger
 leojean890: yes mine triggers for opponents, damage, sopnar, surface
 MSmits: ah you need that, for opponent, not so much for self tracking i think
 MSmits: do you have mine avoidance?
 Swagboy: Miine trigger is important
 leojean890: mine trigger sometimes erases many paths&#160;:)
 leojean890: really efficient&#160;!
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats one reason you need it
 leojean890: not all the time but sometimes it's really efficient
 MSmits: yeah
 leojean890: yes clearly&#160;:)
 MSmits: but do you have mine avoidance?
 leojean890: I have mine avoidance but not perfect
 MSmits: noone's mine avoidance is perfect&#160;:)
 leojean890: sometimes I just surface for nothing :s
 Zenoscave: MSMits do you surface if there is no possible way to avoid a mine?
 MSmits: sometimes you just gotta go into the minefield, unless you want to surface
 eulerscheZahl: there we go, told you MSmits
 MSmits: Zenoscave, no
 MSmits: it's a good idea though
 leojean890: I choose to surface most of the time
 Illedan: euler, gonna let me win the C#? :D
 leojean890: depending on the proba
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: I should do the surface thing I guess
 eulerscheZahl: i do but Zenoscave has something against it
 Illedan: hmm
 leojean890: it's hard to choose if we go into mines or surface depending on the proba and the situation..
 eulerscheZahl: my bot sucks and i have no idea how to change it without a major rewrite
 MSmits: thats relative eulerscheZahl, mine has many shortcomings also, but i would not say it sucks. It's pretty good for getting into legend
 leojean890: :P and mine, stuck in gold..:P
 leojean890: not so good right :P
 MSmits: leojean890 depends in your skill level
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl is just used to being top 20 on most contest
 leojean890: I see, not me XD
 MSmits: then be proud, top gold isnt that easy on such a crowded contest
 leojean890: usually I have less time for contests:s
 MSmits: 7k players registered
 YannT: hey gg MSmits
 MSmits: there's 51 in legend
 MSmits: thanks YannT
 leojean890: yes 51
 leojean890: but I spent LOTS of time on this one^^
 YannT: I was sure you'd make it without too much trouble&#160;:)
 leojean890: and usually not much :P
 MSmits: many did that
 YannT: legend bots are somethiing else entirely tho as you'll soon discover now!
 leojean890: usually less than 10 hours
 MSmits: yeah you said that but I gave it a lot lol. 2 days coding straight&#160;:)
 leojean890: this contest more than 100 hours^^
 MSmits: I think I'm at 50 hrs or so total
 MSmits: maybe a bit more not sure
 Illedan: I'm at N+1 hrs
 MSmits: does random chatting count?
 leojean890: so, good perf :p
 leojean890: idk if I can count chatting:P
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized how loong leojean890 is on CG already :o
 eulerscheZahl: since 2014
 MSmits: cool, a veteran
 leojean890: but many many hours watching replays 
 leojean890: eys euler but at first I didn't spend time on contests and I had bad perfs :P
 MSmits: but not so much time invested in CG i think
 Illedan: When there was less than 4k players :o
 MSmits: your xp level is not so high
 leojean890: I made multis when I have time:)
 leojean890: I only went into gold for 7 topics
 eulerscheZahl: then upload them and share the games with us
 MSmits: ah ok
 leojean890: in multis
 MSmits: he means he worked on multis i think
 leojean890: not created them
 leojean890: I worked on multis
 ZarthaxX: gz MSmits&#160;!!
 YannT: I have no idea how much time I spent on this, but it's probably a loooot
 leojean890: my CG ranking on multis is higher than on contests
 YannT: I really wanted my first tshirt though&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks Zarthy! Super happy
 leojean890: 350 in multis and 5k in contests :P
 MSmits: you will get it most likely YannT
 YannT: yeah top10 achievement is looking kinda iffy, but I'm confident for the tshirt
 leojean890: cause I can do multis when I want
 leojean890: and contests need time at precise moments
 Illedan: YannT, just wait for tomorrow night
 ZarthaxX: quitting MSmits?
 Illedan: All hell will break lose
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, things can change a lot
 Illedan: Monday morning we get the hiders too
 MSmits: maybe semi-quitting. My eyes hurt if I look too much at my spaghetti :P
 kovi: not sure, if it will change that much
 MSmits: the pressure is off though
 Illedan: Lets see about that&#160;;)
 YannT: top5 is very tight, then 5-10 is also very tight but one notch lower, and then it slides down very quickly
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan are you hiding?&#160;;)
 Illedan: :angel:
 MSmits: no robo, no re curse on ladder
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: i see robo
 ZarthaxX: robo is
 MSmits: yay
 kovi: robo and blaster will surely improve
 YannT: recurse has been playing around on a smurf just to try it out quietly
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if robo is playing. but i definitely expect blaster to climb
 YannT: I don't think he plans to submit anything from his main tho
 MSmits: wait what?
 MSmits: why is recur se playing on a smurf?
 kovi: but otherwise hard to reach top. considering how many ideas turned out to be nuisance last week
 YannT: because he wanted to just try it out without people annoying him about it :p
 MSmits: oh a smurf is an alt account
 YannT: yeah
 YannT: basically he tried it incognito and decided against actually joining I think
 MSmits: my mind was working hard imagining the connections between re curse and smurfs
 MSmits: I've always seen him more as a gargamel
 YannT: ahah sorry for the mental image :p
 AntiSquid: you have weird fantasies
 MSmits: :P
 [CG]Thibaud: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and who's azrael then?
 MSmits: mmh Renard?
 eulerscheZahl: and why don't i see an avatar for thibaud?
 MSmits: I see it
 Zenoscave: It's blank for me too
 [CG]Thibaud: oh no
 AntiSquid: browser issues? CG issues? happens to me too sometimes, can't see avatars of some users
 AntiSquid: now it's all fine thouhg
 eulerscheZahl: tooltip isn't working either
 eulerscheZahl: i can see squiddy
 AntiSquid: then all is good
 eulerscheZahl: i mean the popup on mouseover
 reCurse: "I've always seen him more as a gargamel"
 reCurse: wtf MSmits
 YannT: I've had that bug a couple times
 MSmits: haha 
 MSmits: it worked&#160;:)
 YannT: oh no you invoked him :D
 Zenoscave: you have been summoned gargamel
 reCurse: I'm not evil&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: isn't MSmits the crazy witcher then? he summoned it
 MSmits: gargamel doesn't think of himself as evil either you know :P
 eulerscheZahl: still better than being called a team as CyberPunk once insisted
 MSmits: he;s just misunderstood
 Zenoscave: I forgot about ol cyber
 reCurse: Well I'm definitely misunderstood
 MSmits: there you go
 reCurse: But not evil
 MSmits: no submit for you on occ?
 MSmits: ooc?
 MSmits: no ofc not :P
 MSmits: how are you liking the game btw
 reCurse: Don't expect a submit from me
 AntiSquid: write a blog post instead of answering here
 MSmits: I figure you only submit when you have a serious bot
 MSmits: is it time restrictions or you dont like it much?
 reCurse: I only submit when I participate seriously
 reCurse: Big difference
 reCurse: I only fucked around a few days on a smurf for this one
 reCurse: To get a feel of it
 reCurse: Like I often do
 MSmits: yeah YannT said that, but did you not like it much? Or did you not want to spend too much time
 eulerscheZahl: and you learned how to skip a contest now. after you played some in the past despite not liking them
 reCurse: No that was different
 AntiSquid: watch it with the smurf reCurse, you're triggering MSmits fantasies
 reCurse: There was a time where my competitive fire was enough for me to engage even on the stupidest games like c4l
 reCurse: But that fire is gone
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl 0.07 away from the flip :P
 [CG]Thibaud: misunderstood you said?
 reCurse: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits only monday matters for the flip
 Illedan: Hope you get that fire back. We need some strong contestants in the future too!
 AntiSquid: MSmits hey congrats on legend, what was missing from your bot?
 MSmits: the last serious thing I added was selftracking
 Zenoscave: What's the flip?
 MSmits: to better move and silence
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 reCurse: That being said I didn't imply ooc was stupid
 MSmits: Zenoscave eulerscheZahl thinks I may pass him on the ladder
 Boulet: gg MSmits
 YannT: #28 for a first legend push is actually not bad at all, usually newcomers stay stuck at least for a bit at the bottom
 MSmits: thanks
 reCurse: I really don't know what it takes for me to compete anymore
 MSmits: your utg was pretty great
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: ice and fire
 MSmits: sry
 YannT: you probably just need for it to be a game that inspires you 
 AntiSquid: what's wrong with the game reCurse&#160;?
 reCurse: Like I mentioned above
 reCurse: I didn't imply ooc was the problem this time
 reCurse: I don't think the game is bad
 reCurse: Meta is way too passive for my taste
 reCurse: But it's still a fine game I think
 MSmits: I can understand where reCurse is coming from, I have problems motivating myself for these contests also. But it is only because of all the awesome community games
 MSmits: when i started on CG, almost anything that was not a contest, was an ex-contest or similar
 MSmits: so I didn't know how much fun these board games were , except for the game that must not be named in re curses presence
 [CG]Thibaud: what baffles me it that you're still so much present on chat/discord
 eulerscheZahl: but even if you don't try every time, you can still come back from time to time and prove your skills. like pb who wasn't active in the last contests and is first at the moment
 reCurse: Well I still value the foundations of CG really
 reCurse: There's nothing quite like it
 reCurse: And Halite completely fell off with Kaggle&#160;:/
 [CG]Thibaud: don't get me wrong, it's cool that you still hang around, even if you don't participate
 reCurse: I'm still trying to figure out personal stuff I guess&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: fell off?
 YannT: I think once you start doing well in a contest, that's also when it gets addictive and the competitive nature kicks in&#160;:)
 reCurse: Yeah true
 MSmits: reCurse might it also be that your bar is set so high, it's harder to enjoy coding for it?
 YannT: pretty sure that's what happened to pb4... he was just screwing around at first but once he started getting results he got way into it :D
 [CG]Thibaud: +1
 MSmits: that has been my problem
 MSmits: after doing well a few times
 MSmits: it gets stressful
 reCurse: Eh, yeah I think you spotted one issue
 reCurse: I mean why else would I smurf
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: honestly though, if you ended like 30th one time, noone would think you werent still the best of at least one of the best
 [CG]Thibaud: this
 darkhorse64: Chess told me that to win, you must accept to lose
 YannT: the best teacher, failure is
 YannT: :yoda:
 MSmits: that, we got :P
 reCurse: Well I wish it was so
 YannT: [CG]Thibaud: so I have a feature request
 YannT: :yoda: &lt;- see it's not working
 Zenoscave: afraid of 7, 9 is. Why?
 Zenoscave: mmmmmmm because 6, seven ate
 [CG]Thibaud: :hear_no_evil:
 AntiSquid: that's not how the joke goes Zenoscave
 reCurse: But even placing second I still feel super down about it for a while :P
 reCurse: Gets tiring
 [CG]Thibaud: doesn't even work on Discord, what a shame
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid it is if Yoda tells it
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/ey_JjlV9ftU?t=50">https://youtu.be/ey_JjlV9ftU?t=50</a> @_@
 MSmits: reCurse thats not weird at all, I placed 2nd one time and it felt crappy and great at the same time
 MSmits: mostly because i was 1st for 3 days straight :P
 MSmits: it's better to go up the ladder in the last few days
 MSmits: leaves you with more of a sense of accomplishment
 reCurse: Just write it off as me having too much ego :P
 reCurse: Anyway let's not make this chat about my psychology :P
 reCurse: Moving on
 [CG]Thibaud: so who would you choose as Azrael?
 [CG]Thibaud: :grimacing:
 MSmits: I said Renard earlier, but thats a fox
 reCurse: ffs lol
 [CG]Thibaud: ok going back to my torpedoes
 eulerscheZahl: then uljahn?
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: the legend leaderboard is very volatile
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 MSmits: gold was pretty quiet. It was mostly me hopping beside a pony
 eulerscheZahl: was 30th out of 31 on day. didn't submit, climbed up to the upper half later the day
 YannT: the leaderboard iin this game very much has a tide effect
 YannT: I think it's because the winrates are never that clear cut
 MSmits: yeah, lots of randomness
 MSmits: rock paper scissors too prolly
 AntiSquid: wdym gold is quiet, even the #2 changes all the time
 MSmits: I mean the number of people submitting AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: sure people don't improve much between submits, but it is chaotic
 eulerscheZahl: but #1 is the same for a week
 MSmits: haha
 AntiSquid: ah well better with less submit spam
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: if there were more people submitting i would not have gotten out of gold
 MSmits: it pushes the boss
 reCurse: I think boss rating should be frozen
 MSmits: it might be better, but I am not entirely sure what the effect would be
 AntiSquid: there aren't really enough games being played, sometimes the bot stops at a rank simply because it played all games and had a slow start, not because it can't beat people above anymore
 reCurse: I've seen that happen enough with top legend
 AntiSquid: with nearly 400 people ...
 reCurse: #1 is so high above but you don't get enough games vs him
 BenjaminUrquhart: I abandoned my torpedos
 reCurse: You still end #2 even though you're 65% against
 reCurse: Inflated ratings suck, but even more if it prevents a promotion
 reCurse: shrug
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh chat was scrolled
 BenjaminUrquhart: thanks
 MSmits: reCurse that is true. By the time i promote out of gold, i usually get halfway up legend
 MSmits: in ice and fire, there was a 100 sized legend and i had great trouble promoting. I ended 17th legend with almost the same bot
 AntiSquid: funny
 YannT: that's why it can be worth it to play the entire contest and make the cut at each league opening&#160;:)
 YannT: as opposed to just doing the last few days or hiding or whatever
 MSmits: that is what happened in half my contests. It is definitely easier to get into legend that way
 AntiSquid: improving early means increased chances of getting pushed
 YannT: also it's more fun for everybody when more people actively participate&#160;:)
 MSmits: mmh, i thought it was great fun sneaking up the uttt board when noone was looking :P
 YannT: that's part of why I have trouble getting into multis, I find it less fun to be the only one "playing"
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: what you do is this
 MSmits: you start playing
 MSmits: then start spamming people on chat about it
 MSmits:  soon you'll have company
 MSmits: works for me
 reCurse: The MadKnight technique
 MSmits: except he doesnt play
 AntiSquid: ask every newcomer to play the game
 AntiSquid: see them get stuck and rage quit
 YannT: doing multis is like playing against the ghosts of long gone people of the past
 YannT: it's weird
 MSmits: not all multis, but those old contests, yes
 reCurse: That makes some sense but also no sense at all
 YannT: like an empty theme park
 YannT: with ghosts and maybe one clown in the corner
 reCurse: Except those bots make no difference whether they're updated or not
 reCurse: The game is the same
 reCurse: The meta is the same
 reCurse: You only have stable references instead of moving ones
 reCurse: The only think you lose is chat
 reCurse: That's about it
 reCurse: *thing
 MSmits: yeah, but it's the social part, i get that.
 YannT: yeah but also you're the only one currently playing
 MSmits: it doesnt stop me from playing games if I like them though
 YannT: you don't play against other people actively playing also, you play against their past achievement
 YannT: I dunno, maybe it doesn't make sense but it works a lot less for me than contests&#160;:)
 MSmits: which doesnt necessarily makes it any less of a challenge
 MSmits: it's gonna be hard to make any sense of what is an improvement of my bot in legend =/
 YannT: it's basically impossible
 AntiSquid: but you know what your bot iss missing
 MSmits: I *think* I just improved my minelaying decisions, but hard to tell
 YannT: it's very hard to prove that something is an improvement on the ladder, your best bet is benchmark against a fixed reference and even that has some big variance
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: not going to bother with that
 reCurse: The fun of intransitive games
 MSmits: I just want to know if there's any low hanging fruit in my code
 MSmits: somewhere in between the rotten fruit I dont want to touch
 YannT: the only good metric I've found is to push and let it sit for a while, see where your ranking floats (also cgstats gets relevant if you wait a bit)
 reCurse: See how good your bot is against submit spam
 reCurse: That's about it
 YannT: cgstats has the detail tho
 YannT: you can see your winrates against non-spam pushers as well
 MSmits: vs some players
 MSmits: some just do one submit and then stop for a few days
 reCurse: Sure but you said "see where your ranking floats"
 reCurse: Except it's useless and misleading
 YannT: well not *entirely*, there's groupings in the ladder, you can see which one you belong-ish 
 reCurse: I've seen enough evidence to the contrary&#160;:)
 MSmits: i think YannT is rightish
 reCurse: Even more true with that kind of game
 MSmits: yeah its a mess
 MSmits: only thing worse would be if it was 4 subs
 reCurse: I'm sure you can easily be 4 points above what your real ranking would be with uniform distribution
 MSmits: or games with 2, 3 and 4 subs
 reCurse: If not more
 YannT: right now for instance there's a top5 group and a 5-15 group and then a sharp drop, with very little permeability between those
 YannT: so if you push and then hover in the top5, then yeah it's an indicator that you did improve (if you were previously stuck in the 5-15 group), or vice versa
 MSmits: to some degree that's true, there's always uncertainty
 MSmits: depends on how big the jump is really 
 reCurse: I've been stung with that kind of thinking too often
 reCurse: To agree
 MSmits: yes, thats what dbdr said earlier, humans tend to see patterns and changes where there arent any
 reCurse: That was much more true with halite's ranking
 reCurse: But not so with CG
 YannT: I'm very confident that right now, you cannot hold a 30ish rating with just luck (especially with the spam pushers)
 AntiSquid: top 5? but i see 2 points difference between 2 and 3, 4 and 5
 YannT: siman is testing stuff right now
 YannT: but other than that him, kovi, pb4 and val are the only 5 with a consistent &gt;30 rating
 YannT: that sticks
 MSmits: I think my mine thingy helped
 YannT: val made the jump yesterday, before that he was in the 5-15 group, so quite clearly he made a significant improvement
 MSmits: ah and then comes the loss streak&#160;:)
 NormantasStankevicius: the casual MSmits&#160;:&lt;
 MSmits: whatever siman is testing might not be that good, i am beating him  a few times
 reCurse: You don't know what he's testing :p
 YannT: yeah it's not, all his pushes land in 5-10 today&#160;:)
 MSmits: nope
 YannT: he's gonna git reset any minute and go back up there :p
 MSmits: probably
 reCurse: Sometimes you need a regression or two to hit a better maxima
 kovi: he fix a bug....which was actually a feature
 Illedan: classic
 tobk: where was the list with IDE hotkeys again?
 Illedan: huh, hotkeys?
 tobk: is there anything for folding/unfolding?
 tobk: there was a list somewhere, think some external site, did not keep the link...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts">https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts</a>
 reCurse: Look up ace editor
 tobk: thanks!
 YannT: I've always been baffled by coding in the CG IDE because why would you do that :o
 eulerscheZahl: i use my offline IDE too. From day 1 on CG
 tobk: too lazy to set up local test environment
 reCurse: At least 95% people use it
 YannT: really?
 YannT: I just copy/paste into the IDE if I want to test in there
 eulerscheZahl: and then lose their code when the website crashes
 reCurse: It's pretty easy to guess
 reCurse: Most people are not committed enough to care
 Illedan: I use the only ide when testing small stuff
 Illedan: *online
 YannT: I use it for testing but I never code into it
 eulerscheZahl: did that too. then had to merge back with offline code, always became a mess
 Illedan: Yeah, I'm going to have a hell tonight :D
 tobk: guess it depends on the language. for Python it's okay
 eulerscheZahl: there's some weird autocomplete.e.g. you write "con", autocomplete pops up but doesn't do anything. you continue typing "tinue", then autocomplete decides to complete it too, so you end up with "continuetinue"
 reCurse: Using monaco instead would be nice
 reCurse: Add that to the pile of "never gonna happen"
 eulerscheZahl: but for farming language badges the online IDE is fine
 eulerscheZahl: i don't need an IDE for each language on CG
 reCurse: That's not what I meant
 Nanosplitter: Anyone know the math for creating a long with 64 set bits given the number 64, and 15 set bits given the number 15, and 2 set bits given the number 2, etc?
 Nanosplitter: I'm using (2^n) - 1
 Nanosplitter: But for 64 and 63 it gives me 63 set bits
 eulerscheZahl: hackerrank is using monaco. that's why it looked so familiar to me
 Nanosplitter: It works for every number except 64
 skotz: use unsigned?
 ZarthaxX: doing that 2^64 makes it go out of representation
 Nanosplitter: Ohhhh
 reCurse: It still works
 Nanosplitter: How do I make it use unsigned with C++?
 reCurse: 2^64 = 0
 reCurse: 0 - 1 = ~0
 reCurse: tilde
 YannT: use C (it's C++ unsigned)
 reCurse: uint64_t
 reCurse: (1ULL &lt;&lt; n) - 1
 reCurse: Except it won't work for 64 :P
 Nanosplitter: Yesss it all works now, thank you so much guys
 Nanosplitter: I was so confused for so long lol
 Nanosplitter: I just replaced all my uses of long with uint64_t
 ybrobamieh1: your welcome
 Nerchio: what is a fun multi you guys would propose to me after ocean of code
 Nerchio: i didn't touch any yet
 Zenoscave: MadKnight says CSB
 MadKnight: MadKnight says what kind of stuff do u want&#160;?
 Nerchio: and what do you say :D
 MadKnight: other multis are almost abandoned by players
 Zenoscave: fair
 Nerchio: but the old bots are still there righ
 ZarthaxX: do ppl wait for their submit to end before submitting again?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MadKnight: yea but they won't improve with u
 Zenoscave: Id say Ice and Fire
 Nerchio: i mean doesn't matter strong bots are already there :p
 MadKnight: so do u want some physics and vectors stuff&#160;?
 MadKnight: or u want grid&#160;?
 Nerchio: grid
 MadKnight: or u want pure ifs&#160;?
 Nerchio: i hate physics xD
 MadKnight: rip
 MadKnight: why do u hate physics lol
 MadKnight: it's just a few vectors
 MadKnight: u add and subtract vectors and u get gold
 MadKnight: ezpz
 Nerchio: idk maybe if i try some i will like it
 tobk: coders of the carribean is kind of similar
 tobk: no stealth, but multiple ships
 MadKnight: do u like hex&#160;?
 Zenoscave: except on a hexagaonal grid
 Nerchio: thats fine
 tobk: sure, but once you've figured that out...
 tobk: in fact I just started it a few days back to get a break from OoC for a while&#160;:-)
 Zenoscave: tobk I was saying it as an exciting point to add to the game
 Zenoscave: ZarthaxX Only if it's a good submit
 Nerchio: damn when i look at all these games
 Nerchio: its always so intimidating to start 
 Zenoscave: the wood matches are much easier
 Nerchio: i have to say gold was the most exciting part of ooc
 Nerchio: and the league of the biggest improvement for sure
 Nerchio: when my bot started doing good things :D
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic and code of ice and fire are nice grid-based games
 Zenoscave: I agree
 Nerchio: i will see if i will try one of these before spring challenge starts
 tobk: but keep in mind that the next contest starts in, what, 2 weeks?
 eulerscheZahl: there's also another category: neither physics nor grid: code4life, locam, ghost in the cell
 Nerchio: I wrote this one in ~10 days so just enough time :D
 tobk: 3 weeks
 YannT: I might try hypersonic one day, that game looks fun&#160;:)
 reCurse: Ah yes, the suck category
 Zenoscave: how long is Spring challenge lasting?
 reCurse:&#160;:)
 YannT: 10 days I think
 eulerscheZahl: that's just your opinion reCurse
 reCurse: Obviously
 eulerscheZahl: i only agree on locam
 tobk: my personal nightmare MP is code royale
 tobk: that's what got me started on CG as a colleague played it
 aCat:&#160;;(
 tobk: a year in, and I'm still in bronze
 YannT: aCat: I liked locam&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: the marathon mode is what made me hate it. i know it wasn't your idea
 aCat: next time I will create contest everyone likes! :P
 reCurse: Impossible
 eulerscheZahl: not enough depth to keep us busy for a month
 YannT: yeah, it was about one week too long, but still I liked it!
 Illedan: aCat, that should never be a goal. As you can't make everyone happy :P
 YannT: aren't they stopping community contests now anyway?
 AntiSquid: well at least there are games for everyone, not just for the more vocal users
 aCat: But on the opposite then me whining - I really love OOC
 Illedan: \o/
 eulerscheZahl: if you propose a finished game, it can still happen to be a contest
 aCat: I think it's nearly best game
 AntiSquid: what ooc?
 YannT: ah they are just not actively helping setting up those?
 eulerscheZahl: but no collaborative game design with CG
 AntiSquid: so what's your fav game acat?
 aCat: difficulties in the right places, always lot of todos, constant progressing
 aCat: on CG?
 aCat: hard to say but I really appriciate Codebusters
 tobk: code-a-la-mode was fun, too, and I only realized that it's cooperative when it was already over
 Zenoscave: BotG best game
 AntiSquid: can still make a collaborative botg variant btw
 AntiSquid: pass ally orders as string each turn :p
 aCat: Happens I'm lucky on watergames I was quite involved in Karribbean; but it had some issues
 AntiSquid: 2v2
 Illedan: gitc was the one I had the most fun with
 aCat: I missed it - and still want to do as multi
 YannT: it says something that everybody has a different favorite&#160;:)
 aCat: I gave it to students a year ago but didn'r learn much from their input ;p
 muy31: fantastic bits was my fav
 muy31: i liked how dynamic it was
 wlesavo: gitc?
 muy31: Ghost in the cell
 wlesavo: oh
 YannT: I tried that one for a minute, I think I have a silver bot on the multi
 Counterbalance: i joined cg during gitc contest - still stuck in silver
 tobk: crystal rush aka unleash the geek was also fun, especially the mine-faking, and later when everyone did it the mine-faking-faking
 YannT: I couldn't figure out where to do with a proper strategy
 eulerscheZahl: gitc was the first contest where i did well
 aCat: fantastic bits was great - i don't like pphysics game but it was bearable  - which is a lot - and themed beautifully
 eulerscheZahl: so i still like it
 aCat: SURFACE | SURFACE | SURFACE | MOVE W TORPEDO | TORPEDO 9 10 | MSG 1-2  KM [2:-1]
 aCat: My bot REALLY want to surface
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl what does it mean the contest was crafted by you
 eulerscheZahl: that i helped to push it over the finish line. Illedan and me got our hands on an old prototype 2 days before the contest started
 AntiSquid: he forged it with hammer and anvil 
 Nerchio: :D nice
 eulerscheZahl: mostly illedan. i wanted to work on it on the weekend but contest started on friday :D
 wlesavo: lol
 AntiSquid: and ille still above you :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i improved the wood boss so much that it got nerfed later
 eulerscheZahl: still above me? no, again above me
 AntiSquid: even better
 eulerscheZahl: i accepted defeat already
 eulerscheZahl: see you in the spring contest
 eulerscheZahl: and codejam tomorrow if you want
 AntiSquid: not my kind of contest
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not strong in these either. but still trying
 AntiSquid: what makes codejam interesting? i forgot
 eulerscheZahl: they have some interesting problems that aren't just about typing a standard algo
 AntiSquid: right
 eulerscheZahl: out of the box thinking for puzzle solving
 ZarthaxX: u actually have to think
 AntiSquid: how much advanced maths is involved? im a bit rusty 
 eulerscheZahl: more a creative way of thinking, not much prior knowledge needed for most tasks
 wlesavo: AntiSquid you can check last one, actually quite interesting puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i really like about codejam compared to e.g. codeforces: you can solve some tasks without lots of practicing
 eulerscheZahl: at least the last 2
 eulerscheZahl: the first 3 are warmup questions
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i forgot about 1A. was thinking about the qualification problems
 wlesavo: yeah, 1A last 2 quite interesting, and not very hard even
 eulerscheZahl: and most of the time it's about having the idea, the coding part is simple then
 eulerscheZahl: unlike the last CG puzzle contest with the cube and neighbor cells you had to define
 eulerscheZahl: that one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/detective-pikaptcha-ep4">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/detective-pikaptcha-ep4</a>
 eulerscheZahl: for a puzzle it's fine. but for a contest with time pressure i didn't like it
 MSmits: I loved that, too bad about the moebius  controversy, but the other puzzles were cool
 tobk: yes, that was a bit hard to understand in the description. it was actually clear to see in the viewer, but that had some glitch in my browser and did not work&#160;:-(
 eulerscheZahl: the viewer only started playing when you had the correct solution. and everything in a single frame with zoom to hide some info
 Illedan: Can you join in on this round of codejam? Or did you have to solve the previous one?
 eulerscheZahl: get 30 points in the qualification
 eulerscheZahl: good luck next year
 Nerchio: msmits your bot timeout'd ;p
 MSmits: yeah thats possible
 MSmits: show me the replay, i can tell you why
 MSmits: I still have this also:
 MSmits: if (MapIsZero(oppMap))
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452118769">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452118769</a>
 MSmits: it just kills my bot if it doesnt know any possible spot
 MSmits: silence selftracking
 MSmits: is what killed me
 Nerchio: :D
 eulerscheZahl: crashes: 452121599 452120531 452119782
 eulerscheZahl: 3 in 21 games
 MSmits: I know why. I made my tracking constant really high, which makes me favor moves that make me hard to track very strongly
 MSmits: that also explodes the statespace on silence
 MSmits: it was just something to try&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i have this for when i completely lose track of the opponent:if (players[1].fog == 0) cout &lt;&lt; "ZA WARUDO&#160;! TOKI WO TOMATO&#160;!" &lt;&lt; endl;
 AntiSquid: oh chat scroll again yaya
 Illedan: Yeah, was camping the day of qualification&#160;:(
 Nerchio: MSmits smart but kind of resource intesive yeah
 Nerchio: i dont even have self tracking i dont think java can handle it xD
 NormantasStankevicius: I have Killer's queen, first bomb, when I know it's position and blow it up AntiSquid xd
 eulerscheZahl: qualifiers were going for 27h
 eulerscheZahl: but i missed it a few times too
 eulerscheZahl: just forgot about it
 eulerscheZahl: once i was in bed, half asleepwait a second, codejamgot up, did the bare minimum to pass and back to sleep
 Illedan: :P
 Nerchio: i change my fatality code
 Nerchio: and it turned out i do a fatality and shoot myself instead of the enemy
 Zenoscave: Nerchio you still made it to legend shooting yourself? amazing
 Nerchio: :spy:
 MostComplicatedUsername: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: I shoot myself on fatality also
 MSmits: but only if it doesnt kill me
 MSmits: what doesnt kill you makes you look cool 
 Nerchio: yea but i mean
 Nerchio: i literally shot myself
 Nerchio: xD
 MSmits: and you died?
 MSmits: or?
 Nerchio: yea
 MSmits: that's inadvisable
 Nerchio: my point is i gave my coordinates to shoot
 Nerchio: instead of the enemy xd
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan did that too for a long time
 MSmits: the question is
 MSmits: did you know that eulerscheZahl and neglected to tell him :P
 eulerscheZahl: he was aware
 MSmits: um ok
 eulerscheZahl: killing opponent but himself too in the blast
 MSmits: ohhh ok
 Nerchio: hahaha om
 Nerchio: omgg
 Nerchio: i havent seen this before
 MSmits: what?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452131690">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452131690</a>
 Nerchio: now everyone will start doing it
 Nerchio: xD
 Nerchio: look at the last 10 turns
 MSmits: brilliant
 kovi: it is last day
 Illedan: WHAT
 MSmits: should at least code something that makes you start triggering mines if you have 1 hp and have to surface
 Illedan: ok
 Illedan: damn
 Illedan: that was smart
 dbdr: I do the same
 Scarfield: lol
 kovi: i know everyone would do that
 dbdr: it's rarely relevant though
 kovi: true
 gghf: for real
 Nerchio: after i saw it i have to code it now :D
 Zenoscave: I still am not sure. can you move after surface?
 MSmits: yes
 eulerscheZahl: even before if you want
 dbdr: I don't even check if my mine will kill me in that case
 Zenoscave: well. Theres my improvement
 YannT: hm, I'm not sure it woiuld improve much, I hardly ever die from surfacing...
 YannT: too bad&#160;:(
 MSmits: costs you nothing to add it, except coding time
 dbdr: and if you do, it's still rare the other would die first if you waited just those few turns
 dbdr: sure, it's very easy too
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you get a lucky hit with the explosion
 YannT: it's not even that easy actually
 dbdr: you can also get lucky
 YannT: have to iterate over a bitboard :p
 dbdr: toad as faster
 eulerscheZahl: shark*
 MSmits: Yannt let me post a bit of code for that
 MSmits: its easy
 dbdr: half-toad, half shark
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2356d7e-b3ac-41ce-9d57-b776afc960c1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f2356d7e-b3ac-41ce-9d57-b776afc960c1</a>
 MSmits: thats an iteration over a minemap
 AntiSquid: half man-bear
 MSmits: does some other stuff too
 eulerscheZahl: half pig
 YannT: I basically never end up stuck, iI'm always gonna go towards the opponent mines eventually and die that way
 MSmits: YannT the nice thing is that you ignore empty rows mostly, you dont iterate over every cell in a row, just the set bits
 MSmits: I use this method a lot in bots
 AntiSquid: going out with a blast
 eulerscheZahl: i expected some -x &amp; x actually
 YannT: yeah I've used something similar for ice and fire I think
 MSmits: it's the same thing as ^= I think
 MSmits: the -x &amp; x I've used that before
 MSmits: you just remove the bit
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: you mean to get the index
 MSmits: yeah that might be faster, not sure
 eulerscheZahl: __builtin_ctz is what? index of set bit?
 MSmits: trailing zero count
 eulerscheZahl: mine is 1 &lt;&lt; index already
 MSmits: so it takes the right most bit
 eulerscheZahl: getting the last set bit
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: no idea what happens under the hood
 MSmits: I am just assuming it should be fast
 eulerscheZahl: log(bitcount) is possible
 eulerscheZahl: not sure of there's a faster way but i guess there is
 dbdr: TZCNT is one CPU instruction
 MSmits: so, no faster way?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you use that in uttt?
 MSmits: i think i use it somewhere in uttt yes
 MSmits: in several bots
 AntiSquid: cat is out of the bag
 MSmits: i use many more intrinsics
 MSmits: also pdep and pext and popcnt
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even know that this is a saying in english
 ZarthaxX: those are one asm isntruction
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/922651bd-38c1-4e8f-a452-ae539655d078">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/922651bd-38c1-4e8f-a452-ae539655d078</a>
 MSmits: this is nice for if you on VS with c++
 eulerscheZahl: just get the same OS as CG is using
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b445e803-b8e6-4070-8d8b-0998051c4ea9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b445e803-b8e6-4070-8d8b-0998051c4ea9</a>
 MSmits: what is that
 Counterbalance: bsf
 Zenoscave: inline asm
 Zenoscave: gross
 Counterbalance: ikr
 MSmits: bsf?
 MSmits: breadth search first?
 dbdr: same as tzcnt
 Zenoscave: bitscanforward
 MSmits: ow
 MSmits: would that help at all?
 eulerscheZahl: uint_fast64_t :D
 Counterbalance: it doesn't require the -1
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452142175">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452142175</a>
 Counterbalance: so it's really just 1 asm opcode
 Nerchio: last 5 turns
 Nerchio: success!
 dbdr: "TZCNT is an extension of the BSF instruction. The key difference between TZCNT and BSF instruction is that TZCNT provides operand size as output when source operand is zero while in the case of BSF instruction, if source operand is zero, the content of destination operand are undefined"
 MSmits: hmm builtin ctz requires no -1 i think?
 Counterbalance: hm i have this somewhere:
 MSmits: oh ok
 Counterbalance: the windows version of bsf:
 Counterbalance: has an if&#160;:(
 Nerchio: you can kind of snipe top players with submit 
 Nerchio: unethical but you can do it
 MSmits: uh how snipe?
 Nerchio: i mean you play games against them and i normaly don't cause my bot sucks :D
 MSmits: ahh oj
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: well it doesnt matter much since the board gets recalculated when the contest ends
 MSmits: but your starting spot has some effect
 MSmits: I coded the mineBlowing thingy
 MSmits: thanks for that Nerchio, probably is useless, but it looks nice if it works
 Nerchio: same
 Nerchio: you can win some matches here and there :D
 AntiSquid: battlecode 2020 started and it doesn't look fun at all
 MSmits: what is it?
 tobk: ah, the last days of the contest, when you try to implement simple changes that totally make sense in your head and should only make the bot better, but instead make it drop 50 ranks...
 AntiSquid: i will throw up if i play that too
 AntiSquid: it's a bot contest MSmits
 MSmits: whats bad about it? 
 Nerchio: isnt it done already in 2020?
 AntiSquid: have a look, maybe you like it MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.battlecode.org/">https://www.battlecode.org/</a>
 Nerchio: Thanks to everyone who participated in Battlecode 2020.We look forward to seeing you again in 2021!

 Nerchio: i like graphics
 Nerchio: this thing u linked doesnt look fun yea
 Nerchio: battlecode looks fun but i always miss it
 AntiSquid: bookmark it
 Nerchio: January 4, 2021,
 AntiSquid: you can do starcraft 2 bot programming meanwhile if you want something outside CG:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ai-arena.net/">https://ai-arena.net/</a> :p
 AntiSquid: is that graphics intense enough?
 Nerchio: starcraft2 is too complicated
 Nerchio: making a bot for it doesnt sound fun
 AntiSquid: no worries, the setup is even less fun
 Nerchio: i know thats why i am not touching it
 Counterbalance: AntiSquid is that ai-arena separate from sc2 ladder?
 AntiSquid: yes i think so?
 Counterbalance: yeah looks like a clone
 AntiSquid: they have a discord server you can ask there
 Nerchio: you cant play with AI on ladder
 Nerchio: its forbidden
 AntiSquid: it's like we still live in the 1950s
 Nerchio: the idea is probably that people like to play people
 Counterbalance: sc2ai.net = sc2 ai ladder
 AntiSquid: button mashing games aren't fun for humans imo
 Counterbalance: 23h before the timer starts blinking...
 AntiSquid: oh noes, better make some changes
 Counterbalance: :cold_sweat:
 MSmits: I have  a weird solution for self tracking timeout
 AntiSquid: why is it weird?
 MSmits: it tries to process the tracking and if I run out of time I just dont silence and rollback the changes :P
 AntiSquid: heh
 MSmits: better than timing out
 MSmits: it's kinda weird, i save the opponent from timing out to save myself from timing out
 AntiSquid: yes

 Febrin: One line in beam search got me from G 300 to G 60 wow
 AntiSquid: these bastards need to stop dropping my bot
 AntiSquid: stop submitting! *shakes fist*
 AntiSquid: LiorDush please explain yourself?
 AntiSquid: what's with those messages?
 MSmits: :fist:
 Scarfield: gratz!
 Scarfield: t-shirt incomming :thinking:
 MSmits: who me? I was just helping AntiSquid shake his fist
 Scarfield: yea, thought you just made it to legend :p
 MSmits: I did halfway through the day
 MSmits: very happy
 AntiSquid: made a tiny change, will leave it as is and see in the morning if it helped
 AntiSquid: have some other minor changes i can make with the current amount of obvious dedication
 AntiSquid: nice nerchio looks like you're t-shirt range! :o
 Nerchio: hehe
 Nerchio: yea but 3 previous submits were like 35
 Nerchio: idk just lucky i guess
 Nerchio: and i dont know what to fix anymore so
 darkhorse64: I think the final resub will be full of surprises
 Zenoscave: I gotta figure out how to silence better
 MSmits: it's like
 MSmits: :zipper_mouth:
 Nerchio: i mean ok there is a lot of things i can fix when i look at my games vs top3
 Nerchio: but its too much :D
 Nerchio: they dont spam silence when enemy is far away and cant hit them
 MSmits: yeah, I know there's a lot for me too, but it's in the realm of cant be arsed
 Nerchio: use paths that are harder to track
 MSmits: i do that
 Zenoscave: Harder to track how?
 Zenoscave: like reduces filtering?
 Zenoscave: I do that not
 MSmits: well its like this
 Zenoscave: now*
 MSmits: before i did this, my first movement could be a giant L shape
 MSmits: 6 to right, 7 down
 MSmits: after i started looking at that, it would make  alittle square or similar
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452219717">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452219717</a>
 MSmits: the giant L shape doesnt fit in many places
 Nerchio: between 83 and 89
 MSmits: but the square does
 Nerchio: i believe 
 Nerchio: could go straight down the path around the island but its easier  to track i think
 Nerchio: but yea
 Nerchio: first i would have to add self tracking
 Nerchio: and im not even sure if java would handle it ;p
 MSmits: actually, that silence-at-a-distance thing seems easy to code?
 Zenoscave: just finding what is considered a distance is hard
 MSmits: just get the closest distance and if it's not below some value, dont silence
 Nerchio: yea
 MSmits: i know where my opponents can be
 MSmits: thats what tracking does
 Nerchio: you can get dunked on with silence + shot though
 Nerchio: with little to respond
 Zenoscave: so minimum best tracking. smart
 MSmits: you can take that into account also, is a bit harder
 MSmits: silence + shot ruins a silence and a shot though, i can shoot right back
 Nerchio: i mean
 Nerchio: we agree there is a lot of things we could add
 Nerchio: but maybe its too much? :D
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: lemme try the silence thing
 MSmits: I can do it in 5-10 mins probably
 MSmits: that is without taking opponent dashes into account
 icecream17: No! The down arrow!
 MSmits: Nerchio, what is a good minimum distance for this to kick in?
 MSmits: you think?
 MSmits: manhattan 8?
 Zenoscave: manhattan 10
 MSmits: mmh ok i will start with that
 Zenoscave: move silence torpedo with chebyschev of 1 
 Zenoscave: still can strike at 10
 Zenoscave: so if (dist &lt;= 10) doSilence();
 MSmits: yeah ok, but maybe the risk is worth it
 MSmits: but i will do 10
 Nerchio: eh i will submit for fun with this change
 Nerchio: i spam silence too much anyway
 Nerchio: btw who was 2nd legend advance today?
 Zenoscave: not sure
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: VincentBab
 Zenoscave: You're the first 
 Zenoscave: Seems you're right
 Nerchio: damn
 Nerchio: you shot yourself zenos
 Nerchio: and my tracking fell apart
 Zenoscave: where?
 Zenoscave: replay?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452240749">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452240749</a>
 Nerchio: 283
 MSmits: you need to fix that. Assume they can selfdamage&#160;:)
 Nerchio: 277
 Zenoscave: I never self damage on purpose...
 MSmits: well you did there
 MSmits: you weirdo
 Zenoscave: whoops
 Nerchio: i should do a damage map
 Nerchio: should take 30 mins at best
 Nerchio: but idk tomorrow
 MSmits: mmh was harder for me, but my code might be a bit unwieldy
 MSmits: sometimes you start on a path and you wish you hadnt 
 MSmits: tunnel vision and all that
 Nerchio: but honestly its not that neccessary anymore since people in legend dont shoot themselves
 Nerchio: unless they are zenos
 MSmits: those damn zenos
 Zenoscave: oops
 VincentBab: MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: i just mentioned you because they asked who the 2nd guy in legend today was
 MSmits: so
 MSmits: grats&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: gz VincentBab
 VincentBab: oh ok ^^Thank you
 MSmits: errm there is a problem with the long distance silence thing
 MSmits: mines gonna getchu
 Nerchio: yea
 Nerchio: i was just writing this.
 Zenoscave: Ah that's the issue
 Nerchio: after Vincentbab killed me with mines
 Nerchio: when i was seen :D
 Nerchio: msmits i died to your mines now :p
 MSmits: show me replay&#160;:)
 Nerchio: let's roll back the silence xD
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452247973">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452247973</a>
 MSmits: hehehe 
 Nerchio: on the plus side i have a lot more mines on the map with this
 MSmits: yeah
 VincentBab: killermove ^^
 MSmits: oh that replay you shared
 MSmits:&#160;!
 MSmits: its the first evidence of a working dash kill i have seen for my bot
 MSmits: my fatality check works properly&#160;:):)
 MSmits: silence + torpedo
 MSmits: awesomeness&#160;:)
 Nerchio: :D gfz
 MSmits: theoretically it will also do a fatality by combining a mine and a torpedo blast, even if they blow on opposite sides of  the map. If there are two unknown regions and the opponent has 1 hp
 MSmits: but how to check that&#160;?
 Zenoscave: no idea
 Nerchio: watch a lot of replays ;p
 Nerchio: i dont have mine fatality
 MSmits: yeah I suppose, too lazy
 MSmits: you do it, so i dont need to :P
 MSmits: my fatality check combines surface, move, silence, torpedo and mines and also works when the opponent location is not precisely known, but death can still be guaranteed
 Nerchio: i was adding stuff on top of stuff in fatality checks
 MSmits: maybe my fatality check is what I should share in post mortem
 MSmits: that is one thing I think I did better than most. The rest is pretty basic
 VincentBab: yeah i have the same thing MSmits ^^
 MSmits: ahh so i wasnt alone then
 MSmits: cool thing is that it did not turn into if-spaghetti
 MSmits: I made it into a recursive function
 VincentBab: and i fixed a bug in it (so i dont suicide when i could win) and that got me to legend ^^
 MSmits: oh nice
 MSmits: I seem to timeout against Nagrarok every game
 Nerchio: another fatality by you
 Nerchio: enjoy 
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/452253787">https://www.codingame.com/replay/452253787</a>
 MSmits: whoppah, zip, BAM!
 VincentBab: maybe he silence a lot and generate too much possible position&#160;?
 MSmits: nah i timeout myself vs him somehow
 MSmits: he doesnt make enough effort to detect me&#160;:(
 MSmits: so i selftrack-timeout
 MSmits: he's mostly minespam so his own actions arent the problem
 VincentBab: haha ^^
 MSmits: self active count: 23653
 MSmits: thats how many states 
 MSmits: not good :P
 MSmits: I have it coded that it wont try to silence when it times out
 MSmits: but the states arent gonan go away
 VincentBab: yeah thats a lot for 50ms
 MSmits: on top of various other things
 MSmits: maybe i should just prune it also
 MSmits: its not that hard
 MSmits: lemme go code that now
 VincentBab: you can "combine" some states at the price of a decrease in precision
 VincentBab: thats what i do
 MSmits: yeah i had that for regular tracking
 MSmits: not yet for selftracking
 MSmits: i really need it
 Nerchio: corner shot finisher

 MSmits: nice one&#160;:)
 VincentBab: nice killermove ^^
 Zenoscave: EricSMSO nice morse code
 EricSMSO: Ha someone understood
 Zenoscave: S.O.S. correct?
 EricSMSO: yes, thanks wikipedia
 Zenoscave: ... ___ ....
 Zenoscave: I don't know why i know it
 MSmits: is this something your sub says when it dies?
 Zenoscave: yes
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: well i coded the pruning, here's to hoping I didn't break anything
 Zenoscave: lucky submit start
 MSmits: lost every game, so i guess i did :P
 Nerchio: -1 life
 Nerchio: msmits
 Nerchio: twice xD
 Nerchio: well done
 MSmits: whats that
 MSmits: oh I timeout
 Nerchio: y
 MSmits: weird
 MSmits: i hardly changed any code
 Swagboy: I can break any code with one character
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I removed a rather critical line by accident
 MSmits: ReorderNodes();
 MSmits: removes nodes that are dead... when filtering states
 Swagboy: Ah yes
 Swagboy: Are you doing a tree search&#160;?
 MSmits: mmh i just call them nodes out of habit because almost all classes i use are nodes on CG :P
 MSmits: but they are tracking States
 Swagboy: Hehe nice name indeed

 MSmits: i lost a lot of games because when selftracking vs nagrarok he didnt make an effort to detect me&#160;:)

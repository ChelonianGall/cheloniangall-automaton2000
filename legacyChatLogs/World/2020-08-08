 Allis: Use any extension that lets you apply custom user CSS on a per-domain basis.
 Allis: Then use the following CSS rule to prevent the annoying popup: .editor-widget { display: none; }
 Allis: Not having to deal with arrow key thieves is *chef's kiss*.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine with the popup.But when I hit escape to close it again, the editor loses focus entirely
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand I rarely use the browser IDE so I don't really care
 Gorbit99: now let's have a way that allows this only for coc Allis
 Gorbit99: eulerscheZahl I guess you don't play as much coc as some of us do
 eulerscheZahl: correct :P
 eulerscheZahl: i would probably use the web IDE for clashes too
 eulerscheZahl: especially for the easy ones
 Andriamanitra: any extension that allows you to apply custom css also allows you to choose which url the custom css should be used in
 Allis: Unfortunately, the URL is just .../ide/hash in all(?) cases, so that doesn't quite get there.
 Gorbit99: well, not using the webide would basically equate to shooting yourself in the foot many times over
 Gorbit99: btw, while I'm here
 Allis: I think Andriamanitra was suggesting a way to have it be Clash-local.
 Gorbit99: had this new forum post about coc putting me into the ide 13-ish seconds after the timer starts
 Gorbit99: is coc synced in that way, or is it a luck based system
 Allis: Yeah, I've experienced similar. Pretty rough.
 Gorbit99: I'd be interested in finding that out, as some clashes don't even last 13 seconds
 Allis: The timer started normally, but that could just have been a local effect.
 Gorbit99: it was in a clash you were in too
 Allis: That's quite an uphill battle. :P
 Gorbit99: show off
 Gorbit99: anyways, made a forum post
 Allis: If it's any consolation, it wouldn't be especially hard for them to sync that sort of thing, so they probably do.
 Gorbit99: although seems like since thibaud is on vacation or something, not many forum posts get answered regarding bugs
 Allis: That said, it's impossible to know from our end, so I hope you get a response from someone at CG.
 Gorbit99: well, we could test it
 Gorbit99: although would be nice to know from staff
 Allis: One of us kill our connection before the clash starts?
 Allis: I feel like that might test something different.
 Gorbit99: just the start time of two people in a clash
 Gorbit99: if one starts at 5 seconds in, the other at 20, that's proof
 eulerscheZahl: Andriamanitra 06:36AMany extension that allows you to apply custom css [...]The first thing that comes to my mind: stylish. Unfortunately it got bought and collects all kind of user information now
 eulerscheZahl: Try GreaseMonkey / TamperMonkey
 Gorbit99: I'm sure tampermonkey can do it, even with some coc detection thingies
 eulerscheZahl: you can have wildcards in the URL at TamperMonkey
 eulerscheZahl: and adding a style via JS shouldn't be that hard either (haven't tried)
 Gorbit99: but the url is the same as a normal puzzle, isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: so you don't want to modify the IDE for normal puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: but sure, there must be an indicator one could use to detect CoC. Like the shortest/fastest mode shown at the top
 Andriamanitra: i think normal puzzles are ide/puzzle/* and clash is just ide/*
 eulerscheZahl: and then there are multiplayers
 eulerscheZahl: also /puzzle/ide
 Gorbit99: ide/puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that
 Gorbit99: thankfully I got a simple shortest puzzle
 Gorbit99: seems like coc url is /ide/hash, all other urls are /ide/puzzle/hash
 eulerscheZahl: a regular clasher once said that there is a CoC taking 4 chars in shortest mode
 Gorbit99: yep, I know that one
 Gorbit99: and the shortest solution is in basj
 Gorbit99: h*
 eulerscheZahl: he also said that it's a typing contest who can submit the fatest
 Gorbit99: haven't seen that one puzzle ever again since I heard valnykol complaining about it
 Gorbit99: that was around 2 years ago
 eulerscheZahl: clashes get rated by players. when they drop below a certain treshold they are removed
 eulerscheZahl: that is a per-mode thing. So it can be a bad reverse but still fine for shortest
 Gorbit99: really? thought it's a manual thing
 Gorbit99: then I feel much better about rating bad reverses low
 eulerscheZahl: they automated it now (maybe 1 year ago)even for community puzzles
 Allis: Are you sure it was four characters? I can't think what Bashism could possibly solve a puzzle with that few.
 Gorbit99: well, it's good they did
 Allis: "wc -c" is five.
 Gorbit99: it was something stupid
 Allis: Well, of course.
 Gorbit99: weird characters all the way through
 Allis: For reference, eulerscheZahl, Stylus is Stylish without the suck.
 eulerscheZahl: ah, didn't know
 Allis: It's a hostile fork with good intentions.
 Allis: I'm not sure we have a name for that.
 Gorbit99: now I might have a tampermonkey script ready
 Gorbit99: time to try it
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Gorbit99: the css trick isn't working well Allis
 Gorbit99: it still doesn't let you move with arrow keys, it just hides the reason why
 Allis: That's odd. Browser?
 Gorbit99: chromium
 Allis: Stylish?
 Gorbit99: oh, I need that also?
 Allis: Well, you need some way of applying custom CSS to a page.
 Gorbit99: I just used tampermonkey to inject the css
 Gorbit99: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa86b9f2-aa38-4687-bfc8-d774453458e0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fa86b9f2-aa38-4687-bfc8-d774453458e0</a>
 Gorbit99: with this
 Gorbit99: and it worked sorta, it does hide the popup
 Allis: It must be that TamperMonkey isn't firing early enough, but I don't know the particulars.
 Gorbit99: well, it just puts some css right into the style
 Gorbit99: let's check with stylish
 Allis: Sure, but the web is complicated.
 Allis: JS+CSS means you can have a "nonexistent" element that nevertheless captures events and just generally has side effects.
 Gorbit99: probably needs some tinkering in JS to get rid of this
 Gorbit99: yep, same with stylish
 Allis: That's very strange.
 Allis: I can only report that it doesn't happen on my end, but that's not of much use to you.
 Gorbit99: once I get the vim error fixed, I can not worry about this issue
 Gorbit99: I'm slower without that either way
 HoangMrPhuc: :V
 HoangMrPhuc: we
 HoangMrPhuc: we
 HoangMrPhuc: hey
 HoangMrPhuc: hey
 Gorbit99: hey hey
 _-: what about stopping the language server?
 Allis: That's definitely more up TamperMonkey's alley, but I'd sooner just MITM my connection to not serve up the JS at all.
 Allis: I've generally had a better experience doing things that way than relying on TM getting there "in time".

 Allis: Why is it so long?
 jrke: happy caturday&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: cat that like water&#160;?
 AntiSquid: showering *
 HoangMrPhuc: hihi
 dbdr: lol, in Go, if the opponent passes, I do my search thinking I'm them :D
 HoangMrPhuc: sadsa
 HoangMrPhuc: P:)
 MSmits: yay 109/163 on breakthrough with no eval :P
 MSmits: it always backpropagates 0
 MSmits: 13 million root visits on turn 1, over 1 million on later turns
 MSmits: basically, the only time the bot knows what to do is when it's  solved the game, like 5 plies before the end :P
 MSmits: no idea yet how to eval this
 dbdr: better than random
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: I guess when my bot has identify issues, it's worse than random :D
 MSmits: identify issues?
 dbdr: in Go, if the opponent passes, I do my search thinking I'm them :D
 MSmits: you identify your opponent?
 dbdr: identity
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: that can happen in Othello as well
 MSmits: it's messy
 dbdr: the fix is not hard
 MSmits: no, but I fixed it wrong a few times until I had it
 MSmits: at first it worked for 1 pass, but not for chain-passes
 MSmits: my own ones
 MSmits: didn't really matter because when you chain pass you probably lost anyway
 dbdr: however I want to implement the crash detection from replays, and that's messy. because each games reports it differently
 MSmits: how do you use this"?
 MSmits: do you gather information from replays automaticall?
 MSmits: like euler's heroku app?
 dbdr: stats, yes
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: what do you use this for?
 dbdr: and a way to know if I have timeouts without clicking all of them manually
 MSmits: ah, euler does this too
 dbdr: so mostly that
 MSmits: cg bench will do that, but i guess with rust....
 dbdr: but the stats can be interesting too, like win rates separate for each position (player 0/1/...)
 MSmits: ah yes
 dbdr: curious how cgbench detects timeouts
 MSmits: it detects crashes
 dbdr: most games give a -1.0 score if you timeout, but not all
 MSmits: might not be timeout
 dbdr: yes but how
 MSmits: hmm should ask Neumann
 dbdr: I basically have special cases for several games
 dbdr: based on strings in the summary&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: it's on github, check the code
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: it might also not work on all games
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: my script checks for messages
 eulerscheZahl: "timeout" or "disintegrated"
 eulerscheZahl: the latter is hypersonic
 MSmits: he also updated this part of the program a few times
 dbdr: I have those, but you need to adapt to many other ones
 eulerscheZahl: i even forgot where the repo is
 dbdr: and in atari it's not in the summary, only as a tooltip
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark</a>
 eulerscheZahl: just that I found it too
 dbdr: thx
 Neumann: Hi
 Neumann: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/svivien/cgbenchmark/model/test/TestOutput.java#L48">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/svivien/cgbenchmark/model/test/TestOutput.java#L48</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Neuman n has linked it on the profile
 MSmits: hi Neumann, sorry i pinged you
 eulerscheZahl: and now i don't have to escape the name anymore
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/commit/d2978aa1cf88688e571fd41efd3327f4a7407fd5">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/commit/d2978aa1cf88688e571fd41efd3327f4a7407fd5</a>
 Neumann: Here is the part where I check for crashes
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 dbdr: so clean, with constants&#160;;)
 Neumann: It isn't perfect; as dbdr said, the detection isn't always the same for every game
 Neumann: Sometimes the info is in the frame, sometimes it's in the tooltip
 eulerscheZahl: return lowerCaseMsg.contains(Constants.TIMEOUT_INFORMATION_PART)
 eulerscheZahl: i know your pain Neumann
 Neumann: This version works with most (every&#160;?) game
 Neumann: I sometimes have to patch for new games
 MSmits: i have had no issies
 MSmits: issues
 eulerscheZahl: but does it work for game of drones?
 MSmits: havent tried 
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure if it was that one anymoreone game was annoying in that matter
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'll troll you and create a game that gives timeout string without being an actual timeout
 Neumann: It should work on GoD
 dbdr: this uses gameinformation and summary. so misses the tooltips
 dbdr: also the tooltip is "Suicidal move", quite specific
 Neumann: You can do the same kind of poor string check on replays downloaded from the last battles, to check wheter or not your arena bot times-out or not
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I do
 Neumann: On GoD, gameInformation&#160;: "¤RED¤Timeout: the program did not provide ..."
 MSmits: I am guessing the text is red :P
 eulerscheZahl: i think i remember now: wasn't part of the tooltips
 dbdr: and ¤ is a standard escape char, as we all know
 MSmits: naturally
 Neumann: What are you guys up to these days&#160;? Haven't been around in a while
 eulerscheZahl: coding my own game
 eulerscheZahl: with hookers and backjack
 eulerscheZahl: black*
 eulerscheZahl: ¤BLACK¤
 Neumann: Sounds interesting
 Neumann: CG game&#160;?
 Neumann: Might break CG's editorial line
 MSmits: mostly making bots for boardgames, trying to keep up with the new games
 eulerscheZahl: "I think it can be possible to make it a community contest if it's complete.keep me updated with your progress"
 eulerscheZahl: now thibaud is off for holidays so i'll wait till he's back
 MSmits: make the game even better
 eulerscheZahl: the game is finished for what i wanted to do
 MSmits: make the characters in your game do a dancing animation when they win
 Neumann: There are so many new ones, I'm so late and dbdr is climbing the ladder. I might need to invest some time on CG again
 eulerscheZahl: so waiting for feedback, wish me luck&#160;:)
 dbdr: Neumann: good move pretending not to get the irony&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: but... please keep in mind the dancing animation
 MSmits: it's the key to success
 Neumann: dbdr&#160;: meta-irony
 eulerscheZahl: like in codebusters MSmits?
 MSmits: oh, yeah 
 dbdr: all the way in some direction
 dbdr: maybe thibault being on holiday is the perfect time to break the editorial line&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: Thibau**d**
 eulerscheZahl: every single time :D
 eulerscheZahl: what do you mean with "editorial line"?
 MSmits: did you guys ever request a paper through researchgate?
 eulerscheZahl: no @MSmits
 dbdr: Neumann: resistance is futile<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQE66WA2s-A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQE66WA2s-A</a>
 MSmits: it's funny, i click a button and then i have to explain why i want it. So I just tell them I need it for a CG bot and they all give me their papers :P
 MSmits: it's no problem apparently, they like it when their stuff gets used
 Neumann: Wow, I'd never seen the whole segment. Didn't know they dubbed the whole thing haha
 dbdr: MSmits: I use it when it's already there, never requested. so that works well too?
 MSmits: yeah, if you have an account
 MSmits: I have 1 paper on there so I could get one
 dbdr: how does that work? they contact the authors?
 eulerscheZahl: do you think they read your request? or could you paste the lorem ipsum as a reasoning?
 MSmits: the authors get a request in a type of inbox
 MSmits: and they just click approve
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl they can read it, but they dont have to
 dbdr: don't they have to upload the paper?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: its already there
 MSmits: they just release it
 dbdr: from where?
 MSmits: the researchgate servers i guess?
 eulerscheZahl: so it probably is a per-case thing, depending on the author. some will read it, others wont
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: they magically get all papers published instantly?
 dbdr: nice tech :D
 MSmits: I don't know how researchgate does it
 MSmits: just that it works&#160;:)
 MSmits: I got 2 papers from a guy on early playout termination
 MSmits: and some stuff on oware or othello, cant remember
 dbdr: so now they are public?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: only I got them, i am not supposed to share obviously
 MSmits: it's their work
 MSmits: I'll tell you if I learned anything from it
 dbdr: what's the difference with all those that are public on RG?
 MSmits: some just aren't public
 dbdr: sure, but many are
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but research is often unique
 MSmits: one paper will refer to another paper thats not public
 MSmits: "we use the evaluation function from... "
 MSmits: something like that
 Neumann: That's the amount of "try-hard" needed nowadays to crush multis&#160;? Read unreleased research papers&#160;?
 MSmits: they are released to universities
 MSmits: just not the layman
 Neumann: I'm too lazy for this
 dbdr: research that is funded by public money (our taxes) should be freely available
 MSmits: yes, but there's different countries
 MSmits: sharing policies are not all the same
 MSmits: also sometimes they want to make some money off of it
 MSmits: the universities
 MSmits: I guess
 dbdr: editors make money, not the authors
 MSmits: i know
 dbdr: it's a racket, basically
 MSmits: sure
 dbdr: more and more people refuse it
 MSmits: but it's gotten better
 MSmits: 20 years ago you could get nothing
 dbdr: even the reviewers do work for them, without pay
 dbdr: definitely better
 eulerscheZahl: my effort estimation for community games (as you see to care about global ranking Neumann): getting to the very top isn't much easier than for a contest. but gives way less points
 MSmits: btw as for what Neumann said, you really don't *need* the papers, but sometimes it can save you time. I am trying to find some evaluation ideas for breakthrough currently.
 MSmits: hopefully some tested ideas are in there 
 Neumann: I don't care that much, I just want to stay ahead of dbdr, the rest I don't care
 MSmits: lol
 Neumann: He already shamed me on every optim game
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: these days that seems to be the same thing Neumann
 MSmits: getting ahead of dbdr is getting ahead of almost everyone else
 MSmits: he;s in code golf, optim and on many multis as well
 dbdr: not that high on multis
 eulerscheZahl: and has almost 5000 clashing points
 MSmits: no, but you did well on a few
 dbdr: MSmits, you have a more reasonable ranking now that you got the clashing CPs too&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, I am happy with the quest map forcing me to do clashes&#160;:)
 Neumann: All these CoC points ..
 MSmits: one of these days I'll man up and do more of those ex-contest games and really get some cp :P
 eulerscheZahl: the global leaderboard is mostly how much time you were willing to invest. and how you distributed it.the contest is what shows the skill level
 dbdr: well, now most people hav CoC points, no? the opposite of before when nobody did
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl it shows skill level to some degree, there is still a lot of time pressure on contests
 MSmits: some people just cant invest enough even if they are good
 MSmits: like pb4, when he has the time, he rocks
 eulerscheZahl: true
 MSmits: not complain here btw, I invest extreme amounts of time in contests 
 dbdr: contests are definitely more fair regarding time (though not perfect). but doing well under time pressure is one skill, not the absolute one
 MSmits: but some cant
 MSmits: it's more a family thing dbdr
 MSmits: I can tell my wife I am checking out for a week
 MSmits: that's not true for everyone :P
 dbdr: sure, so nothing is perfectly fair
 MSmits: yeah and that's ok
 dbdr: I was more responding to euler
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: then let's say ranking on single games vs global ranking
 dbdr: like Marchete does not like contests, does not mean he's not skilled
 MSmits: I also don't think it's problematic that the global leaderboard is about time invested
 eulerscheZahl: the latter is a hell of time, while playing 1 or 2 games are feasible
 dbdr: yeah, and many people can be #1 in at least one thing and say this is what they focused on&#160;:)
 dbdr: so every1 is a winner&#160;;)
 MSmits: there are very few people that systematically do all the multis just to get cp
 MSmits: even euler i would not say did this, he's just been here a long time
 MSmits: tric trac did it though
 MSmits: that was fast
 eulerscheZahl: and now i can't keep up with the speed of new games popping up
 MSmits: maybe not fully, but you keep up fairly well
 MSmits: at least you do the optims mostly?
 dbdr: new games give CPs only slowly anyways
 MSmits: also eulerscheZahl, it's partially your fault :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tw6tep">https://prnt.sc/tw6tep</a>do you really think so?
 MSmits: oh thats more than I thought
 MSmits: some of these you can quickly slap a minimax on though
 MSmits: takes you 1 day each
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe it's more fun to make others waste their time than to only invest mine :imp:
 MSmits: a basic minimax will get you rank 10 on yavalath euler
 MSmits: well at least to p20
 MSmits: good cp
 eulerscheZahl: meh
 eulerscheZahl: not doing it for the CP
 eulerscheZahl: in theory I know how to do a basic minimax
 MSmits: didnt you do it a lot?
 eulerscheZahl: i care more about the gameplay
 MSmits: ah, yeah me too
 eulerscheZahl: you love those board games. i miss the "extra twist" here
 eulerscheZahl: the bells and whistles
 MSmits: the "extra' twixt maybe?
 dbdr: the hoockers?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: do you mean graphics/animation wise or just pure gameplay options?
 MSmits: like special moves/powers etc.?
 eulerscheZahl: gameplay wise
 eulerscheZahl: the mix of search and heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: i know you need a scoring for those board games too
 eulerscheZahl: it just feels different and i'm not that much into it
 eulerscheZahl: and maybe i'm just not as hyped anymore as i was 3 or 4 years ago
 dbdr: missing the immersion of less abstract games
 eulerscheZahl: had some sleepless nights because i just couldn't stop thinking when I was new
 eulerscheZahl: I don't have those anymore
 dbdr: use coffee. you can sleep when you're dead&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: that terribly smelling stuff? no way
 dbdr: it's a learned taste&#160;:)
 MSmits: I have less sleepless nights also... but still get hyped on contests
 MSmits: even though I find the games themselves less interesting than boardgames
 MSmits: it's funny that you yourself built one of the most interesting boardgames on CG euler
 dbdr: again, an eulerscheZahl/MSmits combo would be basically unbeatable&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: coding a game is a different experience that playing one :P
 MSmits: well I do remember that on contests where we shared more in PM we did better :P
 MSmits: or I did anyway, always nice to get some professional help on tools and stuff
 MSmits: remind me to bug you more on next contest euler :P
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, "professional"i never really learned that web request stuff
 eulerscheZahl: that part is self-taught
 MSmits: isn't almost everything professional coders do?
 eulerscheZahl: without stackoverflow most of us would be doomed
 MSmits: yea
 dbdr: for the parts you don't use often
 jacek: i use scihub for papers
 jacek: oops scrolled
 eulerscheZahl: i use printer paper
 eulerscheZahl: 500 sheets for 3 Euro or whatever it costs
 dbdr: isn't that a bit blank though?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i need some free space to scribble my thoughts on it
 jacek: poor papers
 eulerscheZahl: should I get a whiteboard?
 jacek: thats racist
 dbdr: I just got one!
 MSmits: I always end up getting free notebooks (the paper kind) that i scribble in
 MSmits: you get them at a conference and such
 eulerscheZahl: i know, visited some too back in my student days
 MSmits: I thought you still did
 eulerscheZahl: and we had a coding contest at university twice a year. sponsored so you got free pens and paper
 MSmits: I kinda have no choice at work
 MSmits: someone has to go to these things
 MSmits: school has to have a presence
 MSmits: I can avoid it sometimes, but not always and sometimes they're cool
 eulerscheZahl: i've only been part of an "open door day" (not sure if that translates well)
 MSmits: this is when other companies or students come visit your company?
 eulerscheZahl: so those interested in a job after school could come and look around, seeing what we are doing there
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 MSmits: ah yes, we have those as well
 MSmits: not just for children to come to the school, also for other school to share experiences 
 eulerscheZahl: or where the mom comes and asks all kind of questions while the kid is standing in the back :P
 MSmits: yes that happens, but generally in the last few years they tend to try to push the kid to ask the questions
 MSmits: which is better
 MSmits: the day where we advertise for children to come to our school and parents come and such, is the toughest day of the year i think
 MSmits: it's from 7 pm to 9 pm and afterward you need to cleanup
 MSmits: but some of us still have to teach in the morning
 MSmits: both that day and the next
 MSmits: I always start the first class of the next day saying: Sorry if I seem zombie-like today
 eulerscheZahl: but CG is running a contest again
 MSmits: you got it?
 eulerscheZahl: huh?you are a zombie during CG contests
 MSmits: or do you mean company sponsored secret contest?
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: that
 MSmits: yeah that too, but thats a bad excuse :P
 MSmits: i can only use the zombie excuse when it's caused by work 
 eulerscheZahl: your students know about your CG habits anyways
 eulerscheZahl: they can count 1 and 1 together
 MSmits: a few months into the year they do, not at the start
 dbdr: do we need CGer Anonymous?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: Anonymous Algorighmics
 eulerscheZahl: I still have the contribution somewhere, never finished it
 MSmits: puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: multiplayer
 MSmits: oh really
 MSmits: what was it about?
 MSmits: was that the beer game?
 dbdr: you got MSmits interest :D
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: I seem to remember
 dbdr: again?
 dbdr: Vinidium has beer too
 eulerscheZahl: and Bender
 dbdr: true
 dbdr: how German&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah but he had a more beer-central game than vindinium
 eulerscheZahl: Anonymous Algorithmics was my first game which I never finished
 eulerscheZahl: just to get in touch with the SDK
 eulerscheZahl: you are building bars
 eulerscheZahl: and navigating passer-byes to visit them
 dbdr: oh, must use very old SDK version then
 eulerscheZahl: version 1.X
 eulerscheZahl: we have 3.14 now
 eulerscheZahl: 3.15
 MSmits: past pi already huh
 dbdr: growing fast :D
 eulerscheZahl: so of course it's broken If I try to reupload it now
 dbdr: doesn't it depend on a specific version?
 dbdr: like old games don't get broken
 eulerscheZahl: pixi.js itself got an update
 dbdr: hopefully
 eulerscheZahl: so all the older version are now blacklisted on CG
 eulerscheZahl: can't upload
 dbdr: but they still work
 eulerscheZahl: offline
 dbdr: mot sure if makes sense
 dbdr: *it
 dbdr: I mean uTTT still works online too
 dbdr: it was the first SDK game I think
 eulerscheZahl: all I know: you can't upload some, really old versions anymore
 dbdr: kinda makes sense, at the same time I don't think they can ever stop supporting old SDKs
 eulerscheZahl: and some old contributions just stopped working
 dbdr: multis?
 AntiSquid: how are old games being updated
 AntiSquid: on CG
 dbdr: I don't think they are updated
 eulerscheZahl: that only affects really old versions. before anyone could upload their games
 eulerscheZahl: it was in Beta for a long time
 AntiSquid: and some games have really old versions no? games here aren't containerized, i wonder how they don't break
 dbdr: right, makes sense not to support that
 dbdr: AntiSquid: because they depend on a specific version
 eulerscheZahl: defined in pom.xml
 dbdr: which still exists
 eulerscheZahl: maven still has the old SDK versions
 AntiSquid: so thy do have the older versions still available but deny access to them from new games eh
 eulerscheZahl: I even updated Bender this weekwas on my TODO for a long timenot it's not eating all the RAM anymore
 dbdr: very cool to do that!
 eulerscheZahl: no AntiSquid. some old contributions are completely broken now (black replay)
 dbdr: what fixed the RAM issue?
 eulerscheZahl: SDK version update. I don't know the details
 dbdr: ok
 dbdr: what kind of old contributions?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just that the broken contributions luckily never got published
 eulerscheZahl: just some user who probably left long ago still having a broken contribution in the private section
 eulerscheZahl: there was a rock paper scissors game. that might be broken, dunno
 eulerscheZahl: OoC was broken too before Illedan and I got our hands on it
 AntiSquid: the RPS was removed
 AntiSquid: no idea why

 eulerscheZahl: images not shown anymore
 AntiSquid: BotG and Code Royale are older 
 eulerscheZahl: maybe CG updated those on their own? I don't know
 MSmits: mmh went from rank 109 to top 50 breakthrough just by counting pieces. It's definitely more helpful than it is in Othello
 eulerscheZahl: the IDE link above doesn't even have a "view contribution"
 sOMEONE: heys
 AntiSquid: no
 dbdr: there is also no stub
 eulerscheZahl: just try this

 dbdr: someone was collecting, that's a new one&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: I remember that forum post
 dbdr: class Alcoholic :D
 eulerscheZahl: a classy drunk
 dbdr: oh, viewer works
 eulerscheZahl: partially
 dbdr: ah, ok
 eulerscheZahl: there used to be images
 dbdr: looks psychedelic
 eulerscheZahl: moe's tavern and the bar from Family Guy
 dbdr: #1 :D
 dbdr: too bad I can't approve it
 eulerscheZahl: zeno submitted in 2018. man, this is old
 dbdr: it's Alcoholics Anonymous
 eulerscheZahl: so: is it more beer-centered than Vindinium? :D
 dbdr: definitely
 Fronix: 5 minuts challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: don't you dare inviting us to a clash of code
 dbdr: "Integer y: the y location of the alcoholicInteger state: 2 if upgraded, 1 otherwise"
 dbdr: so you can upgrade alcoholics? :D
 eulerscheZahl: no, bars
 dbdr: well...
 eulerscheZahl: don' trust the statement
 dbdr: the statement says otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: don' trust the statement
 dbdr: were you drunk when you wrote it?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't drink alcohol at all :D
 dbdr: thought so
 eulerscheZahl: but I copy-paste
 dbdr: worse&#160;;)
 dbdr: copy-pasters anonymous
 MSmits: its funny how adding more eval features completely changes your bot in weird ways
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/480898165">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/480898165</a>
 MSmits: I added mobility and empty columns  and now it will immediately remove the front row to give more space for the back row
 MSmits: while keeping all columns filled
 jacek: he does only what you told him to do
 MSmits: yeah, i know, it still funny
 MSmits: because it's so regular
 jacek: looks like that phalanx game
 MSmits: kinda looks like a phalanx, not sure which game you mean
 jacek: do you use race patterns yet
 MSmits: nah, it's harder than I thought
 MSmits: I will try once I get a basic bot going
 MSmits: i want to get a bunch of features in like i did for othello, maybe try and avx them a bit
 MSmits: it looks stupid now 
 MSmits: want it to look a bit more like it knows what it's doing&#160;:)
 jacek: hmm cant find it. its was like breakthrough but wider and you could move few pawns in group
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: breakthrough is a bit like having army lines
 MSmits: I guess that's what i need to eval
 MSmits: support from neighboring pawns
 MSmits: ntuples might work here too btw
 jacek: there was paper on that
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: i tried TDL. it was winning 90% agains my normal eval in 1 ply, but got crushed in more plies
 MSmits: TDL what?  a ntuple bot?
 jacek: all 3x3 patterns for breakthrough
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: maybe it just took too much time to calculate?
 MSmits: or to look up I guess
 jacek: it was as fast
 jacek: and well, i played with fixed depth
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: did you try to figure out what was missing from your ntuple bot that was in your normal bot? There is nothing wrong with combining the two?
 MSmits: just add up the evals with some parameter
 jacek: having 18 x 19683 weights is meh anyway
 jacek: no, i tried only ntuples
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: hmm how do you fit that/
 jacek: fit what
 MSmits: that many weights
 jacek: i only used it locally
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: my NN has 30k weights
 MSmits: what type of NN is it?
 MSmits: Robo always does the alpha zero thing I think
 jacek: its just MLP with 1 hidden layer and 1 output giving eval
 jacek: im too dumb to make policy net yet
 MSmits: my little pony again?
 jacek: you said it
 jacek: multi-layer perceptron
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: 1 hidden layer doesn't seem much chance for complicated patterns?
 jacek: 1 hidden layer is enough to predict any function. though youd need many many units in it&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: i dont use any CNN or filters either
 MSmits: how do you train these locally?
 MSmits: what tools?
 jacek: for breakthrough, i player thousands games with my handcrafted bot and let it to analyze each position to 4ply, then NN tries to fit into that
 MSmits: oh supervised learning&#160;?
 MSmits: that requires you to already have quite a good bot
 MSmits: you were rank 2 before weren't you?
 MSmits: under tric trac/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 jacek: which i have
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: kk that explains that
 MSmits: and this was an ab bot?
 MSmits: i think tric trac had one
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: thanks for answering all those questions&#160;:)
 jacek: if my eval is smart as ab's eval at 4 plies, then i get 'free' 4 plies strength
 TheMassiveGhost_8138: How do i 5 star "The Descent"? Or are the stars the rating of the level made by players^
 TheMassiveGhost_8138:&#160;?
 MSmits: yes jacek makes total sense to me
 jacek: besides i also reinforced it, my old NN analyzed for 4 plies and tried to fit in. again and again until saturates
 MSmits: TheMassiveGhost_8138 they are contributor ratings, dont worry about them
 TheMassiveGhost_8138: oh okay thank you
 MSmits: 100% = 100%
 MSmits: some have achievements though, very few
 MSmits: jacek, one time I suggested to re curse that if you nearly solve a game or run a very deep meta mcts, you can use it to train a NN, he said that would not work. But isn't that what you did sort of?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: i try to mimic teacher, be it solved values, or deeper bot
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/J4cgS7O.png">https://i.imgur.com/J4cgS7O.png</a>
 MSmits: nice lines
 jacek: in blue one screwed and forgot about scaling, yet it beats the handrafted eval after 9k
 jacek: games
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: well it's nice to see that training a NN is not yet an I-win button and you still need to make a good regular bot first
 MSmits: this is true for creating books with meta mcts also
 MSmits: without a good bot it just won't work
 jacek: actually othello was first trained by TDL, then i used the self supervised thing
 MSmits: is it a NN now? 
 MSmits: it wasnt before
 jacek: ntuples
 MSmits: hmm ok, but thats not really NN because you decided the patterns
 jacek: but you still need to train weights
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: if you were wanting to, i am sure you could take nr 1 in Othello btw
 jacek: let rust have a victory for once
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: well he needs to retrain his bot then
 MSmits: and make it a little less deterministic, because i can re-book it in 1 hr
 MSmits: yours will take me a day or something
 MSmits: it's much more random
 MSmits: not sure if I am going to bother to keep doing that if it takes me as long as it did the first time
 MSmits: code size is not the limit here
 MSmits: it's me-time
 jacek: ask for some grants from the university :v
 MSmits: lol
 xlr4829: javascript for ever
 xlr4829: AI&#160;????
 MSmits: ai ai sir
 jrke: lol,i pushed someone above boss and later pushed him down but still he is going to be promoted in next league :smiley:
 DomiKo: yes, that's weird
 DomiKo: weird is CodeBusters silver league too
 DomiKo: 24 people
 DomiKo: silver boss look like random
 DomiKo: while the bronze one was pretty strong
 jrke: more weird is Botters of galaxy gold only 6 people
 AntiSquid: no it's not weird, once you are above boss with stable rank you get promoted
 AntiSquid: also botg multi gold boss is weaker than contest gold boss afaik
 DomiKo: weird is that silver boss &lt; bronze boss
 eulerscheZahl: for BotG it's hard to tell if a boss is hard or not. They are vastly different at least
 DomiKo: in CodeBusters
 eulerscheZahl: contest: rangedmultiplayer: meele boss
 DomiKo: silver boss is randomly walking
 DomiKo: so i guess he is weaker
 eulerscheZahl: silver is also really small at codebusters
 AntiSquid: no, multi is lancer flip + drS pull
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you said that a few lines above
 AntiSquid: rare type of bot
 eulerscheZahl: a Thibaud bot
 eulerscheZahl: by contest bot was like 5 points above the boss when I submitted it in the multiplayer
 eulerscheZahl: promoted a few others as wellrock paper scissors helped me against the boss
 AntiSquid: problem with that kind of unique boss is you can detect boss by hero selection and hard code vs it&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: so if someone in gold hardcodes then ya boss drops :D
 LeBaoHoang8A4: hey can yu guys tell me how to block someonr? One guy just iviting me to clash ALL the time!

 DominikDrums: Hi
 Gorbit99: hi
 DominikDrums: Can you guys tell me how to view history of my submissions for each clash of code I participated in?
 Gorbit99: don't think you can
 DominikDrums: So after game is over I cannot go back to this task and review my code later?
 Gorbit99: you aren't really supposed to
 DominikDrums: Why? It would be only available to me and I guess the number of tasks is large enough not to expect overlap of task
 Gorbit99: because it's a quick and dirty race and you are basically supposed to do hacky, ugly code
 Gorbit99: also, you haven't yet played 500+ clashes, then they do repeat
 jacek: well in notifications when clash is over you have link to the clash
 jacek: i think you can see code there
 Gorbit99: you can't I don't think so
 Gorbit99: well, if you shared
 Gorbit99: guess another reason to share your code
 DomiKo: you can see it
 DomiKo: you dont't need to share to see your own code
 DomiKo: you can always see it
 Gorbit99: yeah, you're right, I just checked one where I didn't share
 Gorbit99: I guess the issue then is that you can't see the task itself again
 DomiKo: yap
 DomiKo: but you can search it ;P
 Gorbit99: you can't if you don't see the submissions
 aCat: but you don't have the title&#160;;-)
 Gorbit99: eh, that's the least of the issues, as you have the author
 aCat: you can see contributions with level &gt;=20
 Gorbit99: you can also see contributions if you've got to the contribution questline in coc
 Gorbit99: even if you're below level 20
 eulerscheZahl: but you have the author aCat. that's enough to start a search
 aCat: It was already said
 aCat: don't jump at me euler ;p
 eulerscheZahl: i'm stupid
 aCat: I was the one trying to help here ;p
 eulerscheZahl: how's the same game going?
 aCat: I got offline the multiturn version done
 aCat: an hour this morning
 aCat: but
 aCat: Now I suppose it is stupid to leave warnings for the nonlegal moves
 aCat: they should be errors straight ahead
 aCat: what do you think?
 eulerscheZahl: both options sound fine to me
 aCat: hm
 aCat: when it is warning, you can gain more time by sending nonlegal moves
 eulerscheZahl: when do you end the game? no more valid moves?
 aCat: like i got solution of length 80 best
 eulerscheZahl: good point. then it's an error i guess
 aCat: yep
 aCat: and spend 20 additional turns on computing
 aCat: you will never loose only possibly gain
 aCat: yep&#160;;-)
 aCat: I will try update it today
 aCat: just trying to finish this damn crossword ;p
 eulerscheZahl: another puzzle of the week that you will finish too late?
 DomiKo: crossword was so ugly
 aCat: exactly
 aCat: I didn't had much time
 aCat: and I'm trying to do ruby achievement
 aCat: what an ugly version of python
 aCat: but some tricks are really interesting
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/rubik%C2%AE">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/rubik%C2%AE</a>the language farming puzzle
 aCat: nice to know
 aCat: In theory I wanted to do real puzzles with unknown languages to learn them at least a little
 aCat: and I did a lot for ruby
 aCat: but yeah
 aCat: onboarding all the way baby ^^'
 Gorbit99: what
 DomiKo: time to get some bronzs thanks :smile:
 Gorbit99: I thought descent is the farming one
 eulerscheZahl: there are even easier ones than rubik :D
 aCat: oh I forgot about descent
 Gorbit99: but this is medium
 aCat: but cmon - I got lot of unsolved
 eulerscheZahl: like A*Craft: submit the default code and you get 100% correctness
 aCat: but it's not a puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: optim counts too
 aCat: oO
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you get 100%
 aCat: buahahaha
 Gorbit99: what's the easiest hardest?
 aCat: batman one
 eulerscheZahl: you mean from the very hard section?
 Gorbit99: I think I've found the easiest very hard ones, but I wasn't successful with hard
 eulerscheZahl: for me it was the last resistance
 aCat: before we spoke euler I really planned to do this the valid way ;p
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 aCat: ouh hard - I don;t remember
 Gorbit99: for me very hard was easily music sheets and light up the box or whatever it is
 Gorbit99: I have 2 very hard puzzles achievement, but not the 2 hard one
 eulerscheZahl: for the community puzzles I lost track which is in which section
 eulerscheZahl: roller coaster wasn't that hard
 Gorbit99: I guess most hard and very hard are about a simple problem that needs optimizing
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, in clojure?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: or just put in the wrong category
 eulerscheZahl: what in clojure?
 dbdr: roller coster
 dbdr: there's an achievement
 eulerscheZahl: that one was a nightmare
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: zeno helped me as my solution was too slow
 Gorbit99: is it like bash riders?
 dbdr: yes
 Gorbit99: just straight up painful?
 dbdr: clojure is fine
 eulerscheZahl: bash riders?
 dbdr: euler is just allergic to it
 Gorbit99: horse racing duels in bash
 eulerscheZahl: oh. I did that in python
 eulerscheZahl: python3 -c "code here"
 Gorbit99: ...oh
 aCat: xd
 dbdr: :no_mouth:
 Gorbit99: cheater
 Gorbit99: that's genius
 aCat: you did this with ALL bash puzzles&#160;:&gt;?
 eulerscheZahl: someone did that in a bot contest and claimed it was pure bash once :D
 aCat: haha
 eulerscheZahl: of course aCat
 dbdr: my vinidium is real bash&#160;:)
 aCat: bashmaster
 jacek: bashing keyboard until it works
 Gorbit99: does anyone use bash in actual competitions?
 DomiKo: now i know how to get top1 language 
 dbdr: they check it
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 dbdr: in contests
 DomiKo: :sadface:
 eulerscheZahl: they only cared because back then first in a language was a tshirt winner
 eulerscheZahl: they don't have that anymore. neither top50
 Gorbit99: It'd be nice to get a tshirt, but I guess it's less effort to just go online and make it yourself in a tshirt creator
 dbdr: but that's not the same

 Gorbit99: what are we looking for eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: the baby picture
 eulerscheZahl: wearing a CG tshirt
 Gorbit99: aww
 eulerscheZahl: self-made as CG doesn't ship baby sizes
 dbdr: maybe if you wash it at 90C?
 Astrobytes: And the baby did all the coding anyway :P
 dbdr: or cook it with your spoon
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and then eat it with your spoon?
 dbdr: there is no spoon
 eulerscheZahl: now tourist is on track it seems
 eulerscheZahl: didn't submit in the first 2h, got 2 problems now

 eulerscheZahl: start with "don't panic" in 200 chars
 aCat: :crying_cat_face:
 Washier: i see it can be done in 200 chars even in C#, how!?! must find out
 Gorbit99: last I remember, it wasn't a complicated challenge
 Gorbit99: stupid me did it in C++ tho
 ush189: anyone knows how to debug in php?

 SplitCode: Does someone have a math page on how to calculate steps in an angle given two points? (the thor practice example)
 Gorbit99: steps?
 SplitCode: Yes, like starting at (0,0) going to (10,10), the next (logical) step would be (1,1)
 Gorbit99: eulerscheZahl are the shortest solutions for don't panic abusing the validators or are they legit?
 Gorbit99: you're a bit overthinking it SplitCode
 Astrobytes: legit, but system calls etc sometimes
 Gorbit99: I guess then because ruby is shortest, that's legit
 Gorbit99: geezus 
 Colorhacker: I've got a question
 Colorhacker: In code royale, there are mines, how much does it take to upgrade or build them?

 Colorhacker: It didnt take money when built but i still couldnt build sometimes
 Colorhacker: No one's here?
 Colorhacker: The chat has never been this quiet

 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl is a bot too
 Colorhacker: hey!

 Astrobytes: wtf eulerscheZahl 
 Memo12334: huh
 eulerscheZahl: I try to include three.js
 Memo12334: what is that challenge
 eulerscheZahl: just for the lols, I don't have a game idea that needs it

 eulerscheZahl: when I upload it to CG, I only see the selection menu in the viewer
 eulerscheZahl: no teapot at all
 Astrobytes: Any idea why?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure how the pixi part is even added yet
 eulerscheZahl: so I try to imitate that then

 Astrobytes: lol
 JBM: Parallel ok, but I want 0% could usage
 JBM: *cpu damn autocorrect
 MSmits: heyy darkhorse64, I started your game finally. Rank 50 so far
 darkhorse64: from your ranking, I guess you have not yet an eval
 MSmits: i do, a simple one
 MSmits: just counting pieces gave me rank 50, i added mobility and empty columns, but that didnt do much
 MSmits: the parameters for them might be too big or too small though, no way to know without trying to fit
 MSmits: trying to do the connection thing now, giving points for pawns connected horizontally or vertically
 MSmits: should also give points for how advanced pawns are I guess
 Scarfield: thats actually all i did for my eval, row*row xD
 MSmits: hmm how so?
 MSmits: whats row*row?
 Scarfield: rows away from "home"
 MSmits: oh you gave quadratic points for distance from home/
 Scarfield: yea
 MSmits: makes sense
 Scarfield: super simple, and havent gotten back to it yet
 darkhorse64: I have a piece value depending on its location with a bonus if the piece is safe
 MSmits: I try to put a whole bunch of evals in and trim the stuff that doesnt help
 MSmits: I removed 2 features from my othello bot during fitting
 MSmits: makes sense too darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: I have not invested much time in my bot. My ept is depth 4 and I select winning moves in my rollouts. May be I should look into race patterns
 darkhorse64: Lots of players = lots of CP in this multi
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I will look into race patterns for sure, hope i can work it out
 Laminator: Are you kidding e
 Laminator: me
 darkhorse64: I skimmed through the "Solving" paper yesterday. Looks like a promising way to prune moves although decoy moves are important
 darkhorse64: why kidding&#160;?
 Laminator: just lost 1st place in fastest clash with the same time lol sorry I have no other way to communicate with my clashers
 MSmits: yeah I will try to do something like in that paper
 MSmits: the difference might be in the floating point variable for the time, but rounded to show the same time
 MSmits: if you lost, you can be sure you were just slightly slower
 Allis: Are ties literally impossible?
 MSmits: or your internet connection was slightly slower when you were submitting it, though the other guy might have had a slower connection also and he actually won by 2 seconds :P
 MSmits: Allis probably they are yes
 MSmits: it doesn't really matter though, if the result is so close that you are in the error margin, then you just don't know who won. 
 MSmits: with enough games ending like this, you'll win half the time
 MSmits: = fair
 MSmits: no point stressing over that one result or what actually led to you narrowly losing
 MSmits: whatever it is, it will help as much as hurt
 Laminator: It just makes me wonder if I could've gone any faster
 darkhorse64: use more fingers to type&#160;?
 Allis: If you hadn't run the tests, you would've won. :P
 Laminator: exactly!
 Laminator: sometimes those tests take a while too
 Laminator: but sometimes I fail on the very last test so it's worth it. 
 aCat: eulerscheZahl I updated SameGame
 aCat: OK - I updated the puzzle.Important changes:- now you can make your action turn-by-turn (-1 for empty tile)- no more warnings - selecting illegal action causes hard error.
 Laminator: wow, my fastest solve yet, and you were twice as fast. wtf lol
 Allis: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Allis: The really easy ones just come down to reading and typing quickly.
 Laminator: Well, I had the fastest PYTHON solve. Leggo!
 Allis: Counts for somethin'. :P
 Laminator: I've seen what you Ruby people get away with for shortest mode. Not fair. 
 MSmits: note to self: It does not help if you do a 64 bitboard and only use 32 bit popcounts
 MSmits: that little difference between __builtin_popcount and __builtin_popcountl
 MSmits: looks like top 20&#160;:)
 LIONSxLEADER: how does scoring work for ranking clash of code&#160;?
 LIONSxLEADER: globally
 LIONSxLEADER: participation trophys weighed? with a completion% and time taken modifiers?
 Allis: @LIONSxLEADER It's based entirely on whom you beat/lose to.
 Allis: I don't know whether it's based on the sum or the average of your competition, but it helps to think of it like an Elo rating in chess.
 Allis: CodinGame technically uses TrueSkill, but it's very similar to Elo.
 Olusola: :smiley:

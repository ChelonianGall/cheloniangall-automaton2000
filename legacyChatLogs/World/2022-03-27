 delightfulblueberry: hey guys in the code clash spaces count towards the code size?
 tutubalin: delightfulblueberry yes
 tutubalin: line breaks also count (except those in the beginning and in the end)
 delightfulblueberry: so to win all the code gotta be in one line?
 NileshSingal: no
 NileshSingal: minimum lines
 Husoski: delightfulblueberry Trailing spaces and totally blank lines don't count, but leading spaces on a nonblank line *do* count.  The best way to get a feel for what counts is to watch the character count in the editor as you enter and change code.
 pbrane: :w!
 zhangqianxu: why I beet the boss but still can not go to the next level?
 VizGhar: zhangqianxu bug - resubmit
 5DN1L: or just the battles not yet finished running
 5DN1L: just 81%
 eulerscheZahl: but the submit was at 9:03 am, after the advice of Viz to resubmit
 eulerscheZahl: so i'd say it possibly was at 100% before
 eulerscheZahl: but the resubmit surely isn't at the top of the league
 5DN1L: yeah so probably it's not a CG bug
 eulerscheZahl: but promotion is known to be bugged
 5DN1L: true
 5DN1L: not in this case
 eulerscheZahl: we will never find out
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 how are you? Are you bugged recently?
 Automaton2000: is there a way to make sure you get the next level
 Ajaiy: Is it legal for anyone to use any XMPP bot in a chat?
 VizGhar: sry, I didn't check that&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you wrote before the resubmit, so all good
 5DN1L: you mean after
 5DN1L:&#160;?
 5DN1L: nvm
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Barerday01: hi
 Barerday01: i made all test cases as true but it does not give me score on submitting section
 5DN1L: Tests and validators are different
 5DN1L: Your code has to be general enough to pass validators too
 zhangqianxu: oh!!!
 zhangqianxu: thank you

 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 Westicles: what did we decide on the tacos?
 Westicles: I think I win with my strenght=9
 linjoehan: lol half hour
 VizGhar: huh?Compilation took too long and has been interrupted...
 Synergyforge: Optimize.&#160;:)
 VizGhar: its not computation its compilation
 VizGhar: My code didnt compile in time :D
 Synergyforge: re-run it? :P
 VizGhar: It compiles properly with default code and fails with my custom one
 VizGhar: there is no reason for it to fail
 Synergyforge: If there were no reason, then it would not fail.
 VizGhar: aha... too big array&#160;:| 1.000.000 custom structs it probably too much
 VizGhar: no space left on device
 Synergyforge: Why do you need so much?
 Christian: It's probably too much if you allocate it on the stack
 Husoski: The limits will be somewhat language dependent, but the total memory is limited to 768M bytes (program, data, interpreter and/or runtime libraries..the works)
 Husoski: Language version details at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>
 Westicles: huh, my fall2 code passes 2/4 validators on fall3
 Oswaldo:  ahhhh - only 97% on eventcan we see the validators after event? only "Conditional execution I" throws an error.&#160;:(

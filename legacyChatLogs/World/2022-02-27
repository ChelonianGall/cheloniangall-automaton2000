 jp007: I am actively looking for job as Software Developer New Grad roles in USA. please suggest me...
 InCog: wait has anyone done the coin guessing game
 InCog: I dont understand what they are asking for 
 InCog: do they want to the even number on each coin in its order or what 
 InCog: or just all the even numbers 
 InCog: cause the order of even number seems to be random
 MrZee: The output should be the odd numbers in order with their even pair
 MrZee: So if the coin with a 1 on it has a 4 on  the other side the first part of the output will be 14
 InCog: oh
 InCog: aight
 YS_Yousef: what is aight&#160;?
 InCog: alright
 InCog: but shortened
 YS_Yousef: oh ok
 StrideNYC: aight, #thuglife&#160;;)
 YS_Yousef: xD
 InCog: Whats the algo that is hinted at to solve the coin guessing game
 InCog: just so that I can read up on it cause I am completely clueless on how I am to do it
 MrZee: If you mean the coin ring thing, I wasn't sure about that. It's meant to be a hint to one strategy that can be used, but I just kind of thought of my own idea instead
 InCog: oh aight

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey jacek, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 92 tacos
 Automaton2000: looks like you have a bug?
 Miki09: :taco: 5DN1L
 antiwonto: [auto] Miki09 has awarded 5DN1L 10 tacos. 5DN1L now has 31 taco. Miki09 now has 36 taco
 5DN1L: Thanks Miki09
 Miki09: No problem

 Miki09: Automaton2000 What league are you in csb?
 Automaton2000: i just did a clash of code
 Miki09: Auomaton2000 Nice!
 Miki09: Automaton2000 Nice!
 Automaton2000: and i wanted to check if you have a chance to make a good game
 Miki09: Automaton2000 Do I?
 Automaton2000: and u can also use it to debug
 Miki09: Automaton2000 Thanks
 Automaton2000: gonna have to make your own game
 Miki09: Automaton2000 ok&#160;:-)
 Automaton2000: what is the end of the contest
 HarryYo: Hey everyone
 HarryYo: Any coder online?
 eulerscheZahl: it's the internet. of course the answer is "yes"
 HarryYo: Can you help me with a logic dude?
 HarryYo: I can't figure out a logic for an assignment I got
 eulerscheZahl: maybe. share the assignment first
 HarryYo: yeah shared in private chat
 DevTenga: HarryYo, come to private?
 HarryYo: yah messaged u appreciate it
 datu12: yoww
 datu12: quick question on the power of thor 
 datu12: Do we just need to add the conditionals&gt;
 5DN1L: you write whatever that is needed to achieve the goal
 Wangpy: The Kotlin compiler is too slow and might need addressing (ex. restarting the compiler instances)
 Wangpy: The issue has been there for a whole day
 jacek: i think theres issue with kotlin for quite some time no?
 datu12: guys is it possible i can bring in the cs50 library in the C language libraries here&#160;??

 Magmi: Guys
 Magmi: wtf is this
 Magmi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2254348d8663fff91a4ff9912f34c4d08250c96">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/2254348d8663fff91a4ff9912f34c4d08250c96</a>
 Magmi: is it cheating?
 5DN1L: what do you mean
 Magmi: did u see the code?
 5DN1L: only those who take part in the clash can see the code
 Magmi: of the winner
 Magmi: exec(bytes('㵩湩異ੴ㵤⡩਩㵣ਰ潦⁲ 湩‧⨧椨瑮椨⤨⤩瀺氬洽灡椨瑮椬⤨献汰瑩⤨㬩㵤孤瀺挫⭝⸢⨢⭬孤⭰㩣㭝⭣氽椊搨 ','u16')[2:])
 Magmi: this is the code of the winner guy
 5DN1L: this is compression of the code
 5DN1L: not considered as cheating by CG
 Magmi: yeah so he wrote a long ass code
 antiwonto: [auto] Magmi be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 Magmi: and the converted to byte code?
 Magmi: so this is legit&#160;?
 5DN1L: decompress and execute compressed code
 Magmi: lmao
 Magmi: nice cheater
 5DN1L: at least it's not against CG's rules
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>have fun
 Magmi: it should be
 5DN1L: i don't use it myself
 Magmi: do not tell me this look fair and good for the site
 5DN1L: whether it's cheating or not is debtable
 5DN1L: debatable*
 5DN1L: and remember, they still have to write out some code first before compressing it
 5DN1L: and the shorter the original code, usually the better the compressed length
 5DN1L: using that tool ≠ automatic win
 eulerscheZahl: if everyone uses it, you still have to write short code. and if you get below 50 chars, that tool makes your code bigger
 eulerscheZahl: the actual problem: CG judges by unicode characters instead of byte count. would be easy to shut it down. don't blame the players for using the system to their advantage

 Wontonimo: test - is this legit&#160;? exec(bytes('㵩湩異`)
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Wontonimo that looks like python golf compression.  It's legit, and acceptable to use.  You may be interested in this tool <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 Wontonimo: cool, works
 Husoski: Ugh, now you're *promoting* that bad habit.  
 eulerscheZahl: make it fair for everyone at least, get on the same level
 Husoski: I suppose it's alright for Code Golf where source code is never published, but CoC is supposed to be about sharing ideas as much as competing.
 Husoski: ...and if you're going to minimize that way, why use Python?  The same trick works in Ruby!
 Wontonimo: yeah.  if you have a site that auto compresses ruby please share and I'll add a link for that also
 Ajaiy: oof
 Wontonimo: better yet, convince CG to grade based on byte count
 Husoski: My suggestion is already in that pile.
 Wontonimo: +1
 Husoski: It's a problem in that the IDE editor is involved, and probably common code between CoC and golf, and there's a ton of golf entries already scored by character count.
 eulerscheZahl: CG has re.judged all golf codes on more than one occasion to counter hardcoding
 struct: try multiplayers
 Keny_fire: wow, hello community. It is my first time here, hope I am welcome!

 Keny_fire: @ Wontonimo
 eulerscheZahl: i got back to STC madness&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that's my personal UTTT
 Wontonimo: STC?
 eulerscheZahl: smash the code
 eulerscheZahl: i still think that i should add some low-depth minimax in there
 Wontonimo: hey Keny_fire , when you see red text it only means your name was in tthe text, nothing more
 Wontonimo: what skill level are you at in programming&#160;?
 Wontonimo: I'm guessing erCurse used NN
 jacek: noobs who cant code eval themselves revert to NN
 eulerscheZahl: i think so too
 eulerscheZahl: still got a few (but less than 50%) wins vs him

 5DN1L: TheRonin Click VIEW ALL in any of the puzzle categories on this page: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 5DN1L: Then you will see the ones you have solved are on the bottom
 TheRonin: Hmm.. I can't seem to find the one I've just submited 
 5DN1L: which one
 TheRonin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/brain-fork">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/brain-fork</a>
 TheRonin: This
 5DN1L: ah that's on a different page
 struct: that is in optimization
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 5DN1L: click VIEW ALL here
 5DN1L: Brain Fork is in Optimization, as struct said
 TheRonin: But how can I see specific the ones I've submitted&#160;?
 5DN1L: They're all over the place
 struct: you need to check in each category
 5DN1L: you can't see them on one single page (officially)
 TheRonin: So basically I need to remember those I've submitted in order to show them off to friends&#160;?
 TheRonin: Like someone can't click my profile (same as self) and check the ones I've finished&#160;?
 5DN1L: Or put them in a Word file or Excel file or in a database then you won't have to remember them :D
 struct: if they are not official puzzles then no
 struct: CG puzzles can be seen though
 TheRonin: So only the ones in the above given url will be accessible to view later on?
 TheRonin: haha will code some script for that
 5DN1L: what do you mean by accessible to view later on?
 TheRonin: For example: in leetcode or codewars you can see what you've already solved or started
 TheRonin: So wonder if any option like so here
 5DN1L: You can also do the same here
 5DN1L: but only on individual pages
 5DN1L: category pages i mean
 5DN1L: the VIEW ALL thing
 Quidome: does anyone uses oponent time for calculations?
 TheRonin: So those I've submitted in the quest will be there as well?
 5DN1L: quest?
 5DN1L: example?
 TheRonin: "quest map" in /home page
 5DN1L: they're probably all in the above urls
 TheRonin: Thanks for the help&#160;:)I do soo 'your last activities' in /home page hopefully everything will be stacked up there
 5DN1L: someone raised this request before: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/feature-request-your-last-activities-clickable-to-show-my-entire-list/194373">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/feature-request-your-last-activities-clickable-to-show-my-entire-list/194373</a>

 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 Magmi: please help me i cant get past 400 in clash of code rank
 Andriamanitra: have you tried being better
 Andriamanitra: or if getting better is too hard you can always learn ruby or perl
 Magmi: Did u learn Ruby only to be good in CoC?
 aimenrma: what happened to clash of code&#160;? 
 UZIHAMA: Hello world
 Andriamanitra: @Magmi not really but yes kinda, i knew ruby from before but only got good with it because of clash
 Andriamanitra: ruby is nice language though, i think it's a good one to learn regardless of if you want to be good at clash
 Andriamanitra: gives nice perspective to look at other languages from even if you don't use it for serious project

 gavi: Hello, can some expert give advice to me, please? 
 gavi: I did quite a lot of "practice" on CG...
 gavi:  ...but I never did any multiplayer puzzles.
 gavi:  What is the best category to start?

 gavi: Contests?
 gavi: Clash of Code?
 gavi: Bot Programming?
 gavi: Optimization?
 gavi: Code Golf?
 gavi: Can someone point me to a blog explaining the different types of competitions, so that I can understand how to start competing?
 gavi: I find particularrly challenging the situations where I can't use my IDE and I have got to code inside the browser
 gavi: so I prefer one input, one output situations. maybe that would be "optimisation" competitions?

 derjack: multiplayer is like puzzle, except you get your input in a loop
 Thorcode: How to import numpy in visual studio code?
 TheBlueBias: Did you sacrified a goat?
 darkhorse64: You don't. Install numpy in your Python distribution. Profit
 dreadylein: SciSharp has a port iirc, aside of that yeah python :P
 dreadylein: or was it a binding&#160;? cant remember exactly
 Thorcode: Thanks guy
 gavi: thank you derjak. So, because of the loop, the only way to use my own IDE is to reverse engineer the expected input, correct?
 darkhorse64: Save the input in a file and read it
 derjack: or simulate yourself. multiplayer games involve well, multi bots. make local 'arena' where bots fight
 derjack: robo making breakthrough in bt eh
 RoboStac: hopefully, though no doubt the server will disagree with my benchmark results as I only ran 50 games

 AwardWinningWrestlerAndHisDog_993d: uæyluæ
 dinmor: go to the gym
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: anyways
 Automaton2000: for the last few days
 gavi: @darkhorse64 OK, thank you. I tried with Mars Landing and I did not manage to reverse engineer the referee precisely...
 ProCoder03: is it one or two&#160;??
 gavi: @derjak: how to make a local arena. Is there an explanation on how to reverse engineer the most typical referres (Mars Lander, the game of the cars, etc.)
 ProCoder03: are you trying optimization gavi
 ProCoder03: if yes, they don't have a local arena 
 darkhorse64: You need some physics knowledge: acc += thrust + gravity; v += a; p += 0.5 (v + v_old); all these equations implicitely use the fact that between two steps = 1s
 gavi: thank you. so makybe, for me that I prefer to debug in the IDE, the best way to start to compete is Optimization, it seems
 Uljahn: also you can try to search github for unofficial referees
 gavi: @darkhorse: p&#160;?
 darkhorse64: I don't know of an unofficial referee for ML. p as position
 Uljahn: v += a/2 in marslander
 Uljahn: ah it's for p
 gavi: oh, so p is average(old,new) rather than p+=v
 gavi: oh v+=a/2 in mars lander, thank you
 Uljahn: no. it's for p
 darkhorse64: No v += a in my ML code
 Uljahn: ye, was my bad
 gavi: ML&#160;? stands for?
 Uljahn: MarsLander
 darkhorse64: Mars Lander
 gavi: oh, thanks
 darkhorse64: One last thing, my equations use vectors so you have to take lander orientation into account for thrust
 gavi: so ML, all intuitive, apart from p=p+ 0.5v + 0.5old_p
 darkhorse64: old_v not old_p
 gavi: for curiosity, what is the reason for p += 0.5 (v + v_old); 
 gavi: rather than the usual p+= v
 gavi: ohhh
 gavi: old_v
 gavi: orry
 gavi: sorry
 gavi: yes, you wrote that way: p += 0.5 (v + v_old)
 darkhorse64: It's an approximation of the integral of v over time delta p = int (v*t) over [0 1]. Sorry no LateX
 gavi: ohhhh cool, yes
 gavi: thank you so much
 darkhorse64: Yes, we are serious about math here
 gavi: I did try to reverse engineer with Excel but I could not get it right
 darkhorse64: :nerd:
 gavi: thank you so much
 gavi: ha ha ha yes, serious at math, as we should be
 gavi: great, thank you
 derjack: math :unamused:
 gavi: haha
 darkhorse64: p += v is OK when you assume that speed does not change other the interval. For Search Race (another simple optim), this is the case. 0.85 friction is applied only at the end of the turn
 darkhorse64: other -&gt; over
 gavi: oh... thank you for the explanation!The friction is usually applied to the speed?v = (v+a)*0.85
 gavi: So for 'Search Race' v+=athank you!
 ProCoder03: v = (old_va+thrust)*0.85 iirc
 ProCoder03: *old_v
 ProCoder03: I was wrong as usual..

 ProCoder03: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/search-race">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/search-race</a>   expert rules
 darkhorse64: v += thrust; moveAndCheckCollisions(); v *= 0.85
 gavi: @darkhorsefor ML friction 0.85?applied to v&#160;?v+=a*0.85
 darkhorse64: No friction for ML, we are moving into the void
 gavi: ahh yes, right, void=nofriction.sov += thrust; moveAndCheckCollisions(); v *= 0.85is for most other referees?
 jzen: It is for Search Race
 gavi: I see, thank you
 darkhorse64: Yes, the friction may change
 darkhorse64: SearchRace has an official referee. It's worth reading the code
 gavi: ohh. thank you
 darkhorse64: See you on the leaderboard
 gavi: thank you! yes, I am looking forward to try to comepte!
 gavi: compete

 TimothyAlexisVass: What do you think, should exec() be removed from clashes for Python?
 TheBlueBias: No.[solved]
 eulerscheZahl: no++
 TheBlueBias: np so
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 TheBlueBias: What?
 struct: is it usual for the entire site get leaked?
 eulerscheZahl: leaked?
 struct: yeah

 eulerscheZahl: "user payout"? so at least no password hashes and emails?
 Robot15: twitch is open source?
 Robot15: wtf
 eulerscheZahl: now it is
 Robot15: thats cool
 eulerscheZahl: The user posted a 125GB torrent link to 4chan on Wednesday, stating that the leak was intended to “foster more disruption and competition in the online video streaming space” because “their community is a disgusting toxic cesspool”.
 eulerscheZahl: that reasoning

 TheBlueBias: 4chan...
 struct: i read somewhere about passwords
 struct: migth be wrong
 struct: source code from 6'000 internal git repositories

 eulerscheZahl: Some Twitter users have started making their way through the 125GB of information that has leaked, with one claiming that the torrent also includes encrypted passwords, and recommending that users enable two-factor authentication to be safe.

 eulerscheZahl: hardcoding? shame on you
 eulerscheZahl: kidding, congrats
 darkhorse64: My hashing was completely broken
 eulerscheZahl: you said so much
 eulerscheZahl: "always question your code"
 darkhorse64: I am tempted to bitboard the thing with a 128 int to try and gain speed
 darkhorse64: and use the 128int directly as hash
 eulerscheZahl: and score as well
 eulerscheZahl: but applying moves on a snake board would be a pain
 darkhorse64: instead of storing tile values, I would store exponents only. I have assumed that score is not part of the hash
 eulerscheZahl: can't you just appreciate this compact implementation and stick to it?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/2048/blob/master/src/main/java/engine/Board.java#L77-L115">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/2048/blob/master/src/main/java/engine/Board.java#L77-L115</a>

 struct: if html is the only thing you know then you need to learn a programming language first
 noahcodesall: k
 noahcodesall: have any suggestions?
 eulerscheZahl: you get a rounded input each turn but the server keeps doubles. so you should ignore the values you get from stdin at later turns
 gavi: thank you. Now I study it
 gavi: I see!!
 eulerscheZahl: took me a few hours to get those 5 lines&#160;;)
 struct: I dont know which language to suggest to a beginner 
 gavi: yes, and you are impressive. me after hours I could not figure out the position

 noahcodesall: ok thx

 noahcodesall: where can i learn python free?
 Uljahn: or javascript, good sinergy with html i guess
 noahcodesall: dont feel like spending money on this
 eulerscheZahl: you mean paython?
 StarsAreFire: This site cost money?
 noahcodesall: no
 noahcodesall: i am using the free version
 StarsAreFire: freecodecamp.org has python vids
 noahcodesall: i meant spending money on a coding website lol
 noahcodesall: thx
 struct: language is not very important
 struct: you just need to learn how to program 
 noahcodesall: oh ok
 gavi: still, C++ might be very uphill
 StarsAreFire: I am using this to learn rust atm. I am struggling on reading input into vector and then accessing atm lol
 eulerscheZahl: my first was turbo pascal. i won't recommend that
 noahcodesall: i literally had no idea what i was doing lol
 gavi: and look for languages with plenty of tutorials, and examples, such as Python and C#, to start. True that the language is not imporant, but the learning resources might make  it easier
 noahcodesall: ok thx guys
 noahcodesall: i really appreciate this
 noahcodesall: gotta go
 eulerscheZahl: learning Go now?

 miszu: question about genetic algorithm. How do you simulate multiple moves ahead with it?
 miszu: I only see how to "improve" your genome but how can I simulate multiple moves
 struct: do you mean in games where the actions are not always the same?
 DomiKo: one genome is one move, so you can have 5 genomes and that's 5 moves
 jacek: or one move depends on other?
 miszu: so I am doing the zombie game optimization
 baileyyware: hi
 miszu: where you can have infinite moves in one tur
 miszu: I guess the only genes I need is the x and y coordinates
 DomiKo: could be
 struct: or angle and distanc
 miszu: but if I start with let<i>s say 10 pairs of coordinates, how can I simulate next turns?</i>
 miszu: some links I am missing
 4ThaWin: Which game should i start with when it comes to Go?
 miszu: angle and dist can be derived from the coordinates
 jacek: make 10 moves, get the score
 jacek: 4ThaWin go :v
 4ThaWin: jacek is Go not good?
 miszu: should one genome be only one move or should be many moves?
 jacek: 4ThaWin its alright
 4ThaWin: jacek any suggestions for starting out?
 jacek: miszu i.e. for search race my genome contains 20 moves, each move has angle and thrust that can be mutated.
 jacek: i just apply 20 moves, get the score of game state and compare to others
 miszu: ok so for one genome you generate many moves
 jacek: 4ThaWin do you have any experiences with games?
 jacek: coders strike back is kind of tutorial game. connect 4 is easy board game to start with
 miszu: jacek to generate one of the genome, I assume you take initial state, generate random move, apply the move, generate next move, apply the move etc.
 4ThaWin: jacek I'll start with those than
 jacek: miszu when i generate genome, the genome knows nothing about the game. it is just random angle and thrust within range
 miszu: that makes it easier
 miszu: thanks
 struct: but on cvz you might want to sim until the end
 miszu: what happens if one of the gene it is an invalid move?
 jiM-: the earth explodes man&#160;!
 jacek: i know nothing about cvz. in search race there are no 'invalid' moves
 miszu: makes sense
 darkhorse64: Make it a null move
 darkhorse64: For CvZ, I recommend simulating till the end. Games are no long
 miszu: when you say simulating, that for the generating genome right?
 darkhorse64: Let's not be confused by words. A genome is just an array of values. I make it big enough to have moves till the end 
 struct: I dont think it goes over 50 turns
 struct: at least with my code
 darkhorse64: I have 40 turns. That's enough for all
 miszu: darkhorse64 the array of moves you made, are they random without taking the game state in each move or you make the move while generating random moves?
 struct: i would go with 1st option
 darkhorse64: Yep, they are fully random at the start, and they do not contain the game state. Starting from the current state, I apply one move after the other to the state
 darkhorse64: I am not doing a MonteCarlo search
 miszu: I did MCTS and able to reach 510th
 darkhorse64: so I have a pool of move sequences
 miszu: only by looking at zombies and humans
 darkhorse64: Although I made a lot of progress at 2048, I am still behind you
 struct: you use bitboards there darkhorse64?
 Flickary: should i be here well im just learning how to code complex programs or should I wait until I'm more experienced? thoughts?
 darkhorse64: No, but I am thinking of using a union of 128 bit integer with a char[4][4]. That would give me free hashing
 struct: what do you mean by learning how to code complex programs?
 struct: I see
 Flickary: i am just getting past the memorization part of python and getting into actually making programs that accomplish things
 struct: memoization or memorization?
 eulerscheZahl: memoization
 Flickary: sorry cant spell
 darkhorse64: But I am not sure that more speed will improve my search
 struct: np was just a bit confused
 struct: I guess you can already solve some puzzles here then
 miszu: darkhorse64 are you talking to me when you mentioned behind you?
 struct: Probably it wont
 Expert23six: how should i tell when my boost is available
 struct: you only have 1 boost
 darkhorse64: yes miszu
 miszu: ah ok sorry, can't hear you from top there :P
 miszu: LALALALALA
 darkhorse64: :rage:
 miszu: tbh speed doesn't matter
 miszu: so don't break your head over that
 miszu: well.. it matters but since you are 10th there is no benefit by making it faster
 darkhorse64: The thing that puzzles me is that I score either 1.147M points or 2.8 M points depending on the test case. Looks like I hit a wall just like before
 miszu: I have the same thing
 miszu: but for me it's 1.7M or 2.8M
 struct: change the seed based on the initial game state
 struct: and have fixed ammount of sims
 struct: ezpz
 jacek: oh change in counting ttt
 darkhorse64: How manytimes do you the 131K tile  ?
 darkhorse64: do you reach
 struct: is 131k the max?
 miszu: I think I reached it two or three times
 miszu: only under special cases
 darkhorse64: I reach it with 4 test cases
 miszu: ok so 4 then
 darkhorse64: Yes I think 131K is the max
 darkhorse64: CTTT is nearing completion. Only Boss 2 needs to be fixed
 miszu: what's CTTT?
 struct: I see
 struct: I searched and its only possible in some scenarios 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/49">https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/49</a>
 darkhorse64: Counting Tic Tac Toe, a new contrib. I made a mistake, it's 1.147M but 1.747M
 darkhorse64: it's not
 darkhorse64: May be you were lucky and reach it also in the random seed test case
 miszu: I tried many submissions to get a lucky seed
 miszu: I didn't go far with it
 miszu: maybe the difference between me and 1st place is the random seed
 Westicles: the seeds don't change
 miszu: the first test case is a random seed
 struct: I think he means his random number seed
 struct: But I doubt is that
 struct: Maybe I was wron
 darkhorse64: 26 * 1.747 + 4 * 2.8 = 56,622. You did better at least in one test case
 miszu: I had in 3 millions once
 darkhorse64: S my search needs improvements
 darkhorse64: So
 miszu: it's all in heuristics
 miszu: and making sure you pruned dups
 miszu: use a set and make sure you have unique paths at the end of an iteration. If you get only two to 4 unique states then you did something wrong
 Westicles: only 14 of them can reach the 131k tile
 darkhorse64: looks like dbdr found most of them
 miszu: I want to know the secret salsa from dbdr
 darkhorse64: He is a beast at optims and code golf
 jacek: the secret ingredient is love
 Westicles: well, that's the last guy on here likely to share
 miszu: he wants to keep the 1st place :D
 darkhorse64: afk for a while, see you later
 Uljahn: discovering secrets by yourself is the funniest part of competition, why ruin it
 Westicles: on a few of the problems all orientations of snakes lead you into a dead end.  I think he must start at a good end and work backwards.  or something
 Westicles: anyhow, someday xevi will figure it out and tweet us a hint
 miszu: writing the genetic algorithm is not that trivial
 SquidXTV: Java test cases bugged?
 fztik: y
 jacek: darkhorse64 i think there is bug when i play as 2nd player
 jacek: or rather, if there is one move left in game, it assumes i played it and doesnt count it in opponentRow and opponentCol
 jacek: also, the statement needs update
 Wontonimo: CTTT boss 2 is my code and it does't handle the second game
 Wontonimo: I don't know when i'll have time to fix it
 Wontonimo: if someone else who is ahead of me wants to volunteer their bot as boss 2, I'd be totally okay with that.  I don't want to hold up the contribution.

 Wontonimo: most definitely it is possible
 quuentinb: Thanks a lot, I tried to find the logic but ...
 Wontonimo: here is the pseudo code
 Wontonimo: read in data
 Wontonimo: set highest and lowest to first data point
 Wontonimo: loop through rest of data points
 Wontonimo: if you have a new high, set the highest and lowest to the new high
 Wontonimo: if you have a new low, calculate the loss.  if the loss is more than the biggest loss you've ever seen, replace it
 Wontonimo: start with a loss of zero
 quuentinb: Thank a lot I'll try to do it
 Wontonimo: the start loss of zero is above the loop btw
 Wontonimo: quuentinb , all the classic puzzles (other than 1 very hard one) are able to be solved in all the programming languages in the drop down.
 quuentinb: Ok ok thank you very much
 darkhorse64: jacek, I asked precisely to rezasi to change the referee this way. You do not need the last move you played but you need to know you are starting a new game as first
 jacek: at least its more challenging
 jacek: you need to win first game bu huge margin as p1, or lose by small as p2
 jacek: stupid breakthrough. i used to own this game&#160;:(

 Wontonimo: hey hey
 Wontonimo: i just solved stock exchange losses.  wow.  in php even.  double wow.  beat that 
 Wontonimo: it involved 2, not 1, but 2 if statements
 Wontonimo: tricky
 struct: damn
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's why they call me "that guy" at work
 Wontonimo: or maybe it's because I take 3 slices of pizza at the end of week party
 <b>**Astrobytes sends vegetable tacos</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: whatever
 Wontonimo: hey, thanks
 Wontonimo: speaking of which, I'm going out for mexican food tonight.  to a restaurant.  like, out in the world 
 secantsquared: good luck php won't help in that realm
 Wontonimo: it still feels weird to go out.  anyone else got the i-still-feels-like-a-zombie-apocalypse feeling when they go out?
 secantsquared: you are braver than I am 
 secantsquared: LOL 
 secantsquared: yes, me, totally know what you mean by that
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: Too many idiots around. I feel mildy safer with my 2 jabs but not much
 Wontonimo: according to data here, if you have a working immune system and are between 18 and 50, your chances of having complications if infected as 10x higher than if in the same group and got your 2 jabs.  
 Wontonimo: that changes it from 2%, to 0.2%
 Wontonimo: still high.  I wouldn't want to roll the dice for that regularly
 Wontonimo: anyway, i'm here to talk about coding and stuff
 Astrobytes: yeah the stats are mildly encouraging, what I'm more concerned about are the variants which will be emerging in the next few months
 Wontonimo: very true.  me too dude, me too
 Astrobytes: thanks to the Great Unvaxxed
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I promised myself no serious stuff in here.
 osbourne: ok
 Astrobytes: Lets talk about...
 Wontonimo: noobs&#160;!
 Wontonimo: hey new people&#160;!
 Wontonimo:  I haven't seen secantsquared here before :wave:
 Wontonimo: or osbourne :wave:
 Wontonimo: welcome, and what brought you here?
 Astrobytes: I think the latter is new
 secantsquared: I stop in now and then when I don't feel like working on code I should be working on
 Astrobytes: hehehehe, many people do that&#160;:)
 secantsquared: then I'm in the right place
 Wontonimo: cool.  looks like you used to be a clasher, that mid this year you discovered multis and stuff&#160;!
 secantsquared: I pop on here and there when I can, it's fun and definitely the most interesting and unique of all the code challenge/battle sites for sure.
 Wontonimo: you got to gold in the pod race game!  Nice.  How did you do it?
 Wontonimo: i haven't seen antisquid for a long while.  What ever happened to that flying saucer intergalactic cat?
 Wontonimo: (now turned into the great attractor)
 Astrobytes: He's on now and then, albeit briefly, doing other things I guess
 Uljahn: he's more active on discord
 TheBlueBias: :older_man:
 Westicles: heh heh.  midwits here
 BobLob: Would anyone know why I'm getting messages that random people have approved or refused different clashes of code?
 Westicles: look in settings
 TheBlueBias: You played enough clashs to get moderation rights on them.
 BobLob: ah, I see.  Thanks for the info
 Westicles: huh, all my crappy contribs got approved
 TheBlueBias: But as Westicles said you can deactivate these notification in your account settings BobLob
 BobLob: Got it, thanks again
 Viprixity: wassup
 Viprixity: Does this help you learn coding
 Viprixity: i really wanna be a developer so im using this
 Viprixity: im 13
 Wontonimo: so many 13s on this site
 Wontonimo: Viprixity this site doesn't really teach you.  It is good for challenging yourself once you know the basics
 Wontonimo: 1/2 a million people have attempted this challenge and only 54% have succeeded.  It one of the easiest challenges here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 Wontonimo: if you find it too difficult, practice "if" statements, loops, and arrays then definitely come back
 dan.b: i've completed this one :sunglasses:
 Astrobytes: Martin Fierro rips it up every time!
 Astrobytes: Aw crap, wrong window, sorry.
 Astrobytes: I'll close this one, goodnight :saxophone:
 cw477: qwerty
 cw477: uiop
 Thorcode: Yeah I have another teammate to beat the cat
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode, how goes the coding?
 Thorcode: nice
 Thorcode: I'm trying the 6-5 kyu on codewars
 Wontonimo: hey, moving up in the ranks
 Wontonimo: how was 7th?
 Thorcode: not really hard :grin:
 Thorcode: it very simple
 Thorcode: some 1kyu is easy but it not in python lan&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: passed both 8th and 7th.  cool
 Thorcode: well solve a 6 kyu I pass a rank&#160;:)
 Thorcode: have you join Codewar?
 Wontonimo: yes, just to check it out
 Wontonimo: not serious about it.  i was just browsing while chatting here and saw this fun puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5dc49700c6f56800271424a5">https://www.codewars.com/kata/5dc49700c6f56800271424a5</a>
 Wontonimo: it is the classic key-and-door maze
 Wontonimo: this is the "literal" implementation of a dungeon crawl mechanic that is found in so many games
 Wontonimo: you have to find the thing (key) that helps you pass some challenge (door).  
 Wontonimo: It could be a giant man eating slug (as a door) and to pass it you have to pick up some salt (the key) from a beach
 Thorcode: really 3kyu
 Thorcode: you serious&#160;? Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: i'm not suggesting you attempt it.  I was just saying i like the puzzle
 Thorcode: yeah
 Wontonimo: that it is "classic" and very much at the heart of a lot of dungeon crawlers
 Thorcode: it look difficult
 Thorcode: I don't even understand the input
 Wontonimo: read the description
 Wontonimo: the upper case letters are doors
 Wontonimo: so A B C are all doors
 Wontonimo: and the lower case characters are the keys&#160;: a b c ...
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Thorcode: yup the character is stand for thing in the dungeon
 Wontonimo: why flip table struct?
 struct: loa is hard
 Thorcode: how could you understand what struct is saying
 struct: mcts seems way easier than minimax
 Wontonimo: lines of action is hard i bet
 struct: yeap
 struct: the move generator is very slow
 struct: And I cant understand what the paper writer is trying to say
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5aab8efe-0bf6-4b23-9084-8d6e2b9f1f6c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5aab8efe-0bf6-4b23-9084-8d6e2b9f1f6c</a>
 Wontonimo: i think they are saying to optimize move generation
 Wontonimo: but they could be talking about a chicken recipe 
 struct: one day ill understand how to read these papers
 struct: I think mine isn't slow but its not anywhere close to the paper implementation
 struct: At least fom what I understand from it
 struct: hmm
 struct: I think I understand
 Wontonimo: you have more patience than i do to read those papers
 struct: I dont read them
 struct: I read like &lt; 10% of it
 Wontonimo: for these games I like to just jump in and do a minimum of reading
 struct: well I did the bot
 struct: but I dont know what to do
 struct: its only behind minimax god

 Thorcode: what is this mean?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/HGkVDjL.png">https://i.imgur.com/HGkVDjL.png</a>
 Wontonimo: it means that 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
 struct: n is not a number
 Wontonimo: try thisfor i in range(int(n)):
 Thorcode: no why I passed all testcase but this happend
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/zfYhKBd">https://imgur.com/a/zfYhKBd</a>
 Wontonimo: what value was passed in for that last test case?  if it was "" or "x" then it'll throw an errror
 Wontonimo: read the write up of what is expected if the input is invalid
 Wontonimo: perhaps you are supposed to return -1
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false
 Thorcode: I suck
 Wontonimo: you failed your duty.  that makes doodie of your duty
 Thorcode: yep I missed that
 Thorcode: isinstance(n, int)
 Thorcode: can I do this?
 Wontonimo: if type(n) == int&#160;:
 Thorcode: oh thanks

 Thorcode: thanks Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: you are welcome.  if only i knew a similar trick to help struct
 struct: I think i understand what they do
 struct: But not sure how to implement it yet
 struct: basicly it will avoid me doing
 struct: popcnt * n_pieces * 4
 Wontonimo: 1 of 2 tasks done.  I'd say you are 50% done and it only took you an hour or so.  Given another hour just imagine what you'll accomplish
 Wontonimo: yikes, that's a lot of calculations
 struct: yeah and doing that every turn gets expensive I guess
 struct: every move gen*
 Thorcode: what are you guy doing?
 struct: lines of action
 struct: its a board game
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I know it
 Thorcode: that game is fun
 Thorcode: even I don't understand the rule of it
 Thorcode: but it look fun
 tubronjame: I'm not good in English
 Wontonimo: ok
 Wontonimo: mi englisk is bad allso
 Thorcode: yep bad
 Wontonimo: real bad
 Wontonimo: and, it is the only language i know&#160;:(
 Thorcode: you pretend to be a noob right?
 Wontonimo: tubronjame or me?
 Thorcode: you
 Thorcode: Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: oh.  no, i'm not pretending to be noob.  i'm admitting my poor language skills, specifically spelling  of my native language
 miszu: how you sort a vector efficiently when your sorting depends on the game state?
 miszu: nvm I found a hack
 Thorcode: who?
 mr.zhongnight: real?
 Thorcode: oh it not a person
 Thorcode: is there anything I can do in CG?

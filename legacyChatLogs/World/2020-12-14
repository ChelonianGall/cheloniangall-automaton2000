 mzbear: wtf.  i woke up wanting to continue working on my bot to reach wood1 ... and i just got notification that i reached wood1
 mzbear: Ah, Polilla and DavidAvsajanishvili, I thank both of you for submitting your bots to lose against mine, I needed that push since my score was so close to the boss :D
 mzbear: this is a bit of an anticlimactic ending, though. I had a 4 hour nap so I could keep pushing the bot, and minutes after I wake up I hear that Blip notification sound from the computer.  I suppose I should go back to sleep
 mzbear: My bot is so much worse than everyone else in wood1 league, I didn't deserve this lol
 struct: oh well
 struct: I got pushed from 40th gold
 struct: to legend in FC2020
 mzbear: oh man
 struct: its more prone to happen on active multis
 mzbear: the fall challenge was the first bot programming thing i participated in, and i was at, like, 27th silver at one point, and I kept pushing changes and never got into gold at all. I started it 5 days late, too, and wrote the first prototype with python3 before rewriting in c++
 Cucsijuan: Hi, I get a lot of "Can't send a troop from a factory you don't control", and happens when I issue a MOVE just a sec after a troop takes my base, any idea why is it happening?
 struct: well if they just took your base you can no longer send units right?
 Cucsijuan: so do I have to predict if is it going to be taken
 struct: Do you have a replay?
 Cucsijuan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/515863131">https://www.codingame.com/replay/515863131</a>
 Cucsijuan: MOVE 5 3 8
 struct: I think you did not own the factory anymore
 struct: you sent units when they arrive
 Cucsijuan: maybe I f***ed up the input reading
 struct: but im gonna try to replicate on ide
 struct: you can send troops
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/515863698">https://www.codingame.com/replay/515863698</a>
 struct: Here turn 20
 struct: I no longer own factory
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/515863742">https://www.codingame.com/replay/515863742</a>
 struct: turn 19 I send troops
 Cucsijuan: ok yep, i think I messed up the input
 Cucsijuan: and Im managing wrong info maybe
 Cucsijuan: I got a warning regarding that
 struct: ah
 struct: maybe you are printing two times on same turn?
 struct: It can happen and it makes it go out of sync
 Cucsijuan: what do you mean by "printing"
 struct: outputing
 Cucsijuan: cout or cerr?
 struct: cout
 Cucsijuan: yep im outputing
 struct: how many cout do you have?
 Cucsijuan: I though I could do that
 Cucsijuan: depends on the situation
 struct: you can have more than 1
 struct: but for example if you have 1 cout
 struct: and later you run a cout again
 struct: it will go on referee aswell
 Cucsijuan: my code can send like 10 or more couts per frame
 struct: yeah that will cause you to skip some inputs
 Cucsijuan: so if I want multiple MOVEs
 Cucsijuan: should I chain them in one cout
 Cucsijuan: with&#160;:
 Cucsijuan:&#160;;
 struct: yeah with&#160;;
 Cucsijuan: ok great, will try that, thanks
 ChampionCoder: has anyone noticed that the reverse of "codingame" is "emagnidoc"? :sweat_smile:
 ChampionCoder: It sounds like "enigmatic doctor"
 ChampionCoder: And by the way, can you guys give your feed back on this:

 mzbear: that seems a bit too simple to be meaningful for shortest mode
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44fc2913-7354-423a-bc19-d1998b647507">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44fc2913-7354-423a-bc19-d1998b647507</a>
 AntiSquid: ChampionCoder
 mzbear: yea, it's particularly simple for languages where reversing a string is either a standard function or built into the language directly
 ChampionCoder: Thanks for the feedback! :slight_smile:
 ChampionCoder: And AntiSquid I'll have a look at that
 Westicles: Too simple is not allowed as feedback.  Rule 1 or whatever
 ChampionCoder: Had a look at the link AntiSquid. That was what I had in mind foor shortest mode
 ChampionCoder: *For
 wlesavo: the better one would be to reverse the string twice :slight_smile:
 mzbear: westicles, are you being butthurt about something again?
 Westicles: No, I'm serious
 ChampionCoder: If you reverse the string twice, won't we get the same thing?
 wlesavo: exactly
 ChampionCoder: *wlesavo
 ChampionCoder: Ohh
 ChampionCoder: ok
 ChampionCoder: But...
 wlesavo: jk
 ChampionCoder: yeah you can submit that @wlesavo
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines</a>
 Westicles: "No CoC puzzle should be rejected with the justification that it's too simple."
 Westicles: so there, Mr. Butthurt caller&#160;:)
 ChampionCoder: lol :sweat_smile:
 kishorecoder: hi
 mzbear: i explicitly specified i was talking about the shortest mode
 Westicles: no, you were talking about my butt (again)
 mzbear: when there aren't many possible answers, it becomes a bit meaningless, there's nothing to do
 mzbear: alright, i admit i'm at fault for that
 ChampionCoder: And can somebody help me with the Code vs Zombies quest? always falling short of 40,000 points :disappointed:
 ChampionCoder: Will appreciate any help
 ChampionCoder: Thanks in Advance
 VizGhar: ChampionCoder have you tried to look into forum?
 ChampionCoder: Sorry?
 Westicles: We all got in big trouble
 Westicles: Even though I never heard of you before
 mzbear: such is the nature of internet drama
 Westicles: mzbear, not meaning to offend, but do you have some philosophical (or other) basis to your worldview?  I am always fascinated by people who have a firm opinion on almost everything
 mzbear: hmm... my worldview is a strange mixture of discordian, lawful, and liberal values. it's not exactly following any clearly unified philosophy
 mzbear: liberal but pedantic, if that makes any sense
 Westicles: sure, sounds like a personal creation
 mzbear: i just spent 10 minutes trying to come up with a better description of my worldview and failed.  like all things in life, nothing's simple once you take a good long look at it, but it's complexity that originates from the observer and not the subject matter
 Westicles: ha, everything is simple except you?
 mzbear: life is life, it follows fairly straightforward principles on the low level, i think
 Westicles: sure, you can derive everything from max entropy
 mzbear: lol, just did the cgx-formatter puzzle and wrote a silly recursive descent parser, and it seems nobody else did it that way
 mzbear: this puzzle needs an episode 2 that requires syntax checking ;D
 darkhorse64: mzbear: You made it&#160;! Congrats&#160;!
 mzbear: darkhorse: it was a bit disappointing, because i took a nap and my ranking went up without having to improve my bot
 mzbear: my bot is super weak compared to everyone else in wood1
 mzbear: also, i dont think it counted for clearing the puzzle of the week *sigh*
 darkhorse64: This one was quite difficult. It's an achievement in itself
 mzbear: i certainly underestimated the difficulty when i jumped into it.  i thought i'd be done in a day or two :D
 darkhorse64: This game has clearly one of the most difficult move generation engine
 YodaMaster123: Blcoking right?
 darkhorse64: You wrote a MCTS n-player engine&#160;? I only wrote 2-players engines. Yes, blocking
 mzbear: yep, i had to write a separate movegens with slightly different optimizations for getting all moves and for getting an reasonably uniformly random move
 mzbear: total of 900 lines of code, a bit too large for my taste
 mzbear: the worst part is that i'm not supposed to show the code to anyone, and i put so much work into it :D
 C_Boy: hi does anyone know how i can move a contribution in WIP for a clash of code to an easy in/out category without having to rewrite it all?
 helenica: hi i'm supposed to send code sample for job application, can anyone recommend me cool puzzle that has an interesting problem solved? your personal favorite? its for game dev job, and im just so anxious about it
 YodaMaster123: Go for one of the AI challenges.
 YodaMaster123: Something like a tree search for tic tac toe would be cool
 helenica: thanks for the advice!
 helenica: wow, yes!!!
 darkhorse64: 900 lines is pretty standard for a board game with a powerful search engine.
 darkhorse64: at least fpr me
 darkhorse64: *for*
 YodaMaster123: Wow, for blocking, Wood1 is basically legend...
 YodaMaster123: Awesome mzbear!!!
 mzbear: heh, i dont think i would've even bothered trying if someone had told me that beforehand
 YodaMaster123: Takes a lot of skill to be in the top 5 of a multi... 
 mzbear: not if there aren't many participants&#160;:)
 YodaMaster123: The top 10 are still just as competitive :D all of the really good guys are there anyway...
 mzbear: since my bot is only barely on level of the boss, it's likely going to stay at bottom of wood1 forever unless i continue working on it.  so, being in top5 is only because not enough people have bothered writing their own bot
 Maxim251: Wait untill some peoples at Your level will pass wood1, then You will be on top. I have similar situation, after two or tree days, I passed wood 1
 Q12: Yes!!! I finally complete Vox Codei - Episode 2 :grinning:
 mzbear: I suppose I'll write another bot to some more casual game. I'm a bit upset the list in compete page doesn't show number of participants for each game
 wlesavo: well you can check the ladder manually before diving into it
 wlesavo: Q12 thats a nice one, i think i had some hardcoded stuff for the last test case, and checking the solutions many others did smth simmilar as well 
 VizGhar: Hmm is it just me, or all Google services except search engine are down?
 YodaMaster123: Can someone send me the link for the Blocking referee?
 YodaMaster123: I wanted to see it after hearing about how complex it is :P
 mzbear: that's the thing... you dont have it
 YodaMaster123: Why?
 YodaMaster123: All the other ones do?
 YodaMaster123: Then you built a simulation without a referee? WOW:??
 YodaMaster123: How much time did the simulation take
 mzbear: i wrote the entire damn thing on the web editor
 YodaMaster123: :joy:
 mzbear: at least the referee is kind enough to provide a list of valid moves to me, so i could compare that to my own move generator until i got all the bugs fixed
 Q12: @wlesavo yeah, the final test case was very hard. I would have finish the puzzle two days ago if the final test case was not exist :slight_smile:

 Maxim251: I pass all cases, but why I need conect nodes longer then 2?
 Maxim251: after submit I din't pass brocken square and tunnel
 derjack: oO
 Maxim251: YES! I passed, It come out that I need add 3 loop to check how far nodes are in vertical or horisontal 
 mzbear: congratulations maxim

 Maxim251: this is part of nested loop
 Maxim251: And k represents lenght beetwen nodes
 Maxim251: I dont understand, How is made pointing in puzzles? Because i Clean code from debugging code, I make extra lines to brake loops that they are not go full to end, and still I am in that same position in the list with best coders. I did not move eve one position
 mzbear: what list? the published solutions? they're voted by other users, so it'll take time to gain upvotes
 mzbear: if you mean 100% ... that's just the test completion percentage
 Maxim251: Oww.. Then I spend few more seconds only to make my code more efitiency&#160;:(
 mzbear: it's always good to clean up your code once you're done, especially if you choose to publish your solution for others to see
 Maxim251: Yeah&#160;:)
 Maxim251: Now when I see my cleaned code, with break from loop, now looks like poem :D
 Astrobytes: well done on Blocking mzbear&#160;:)
 mzbear: I thought I'd try something relaxing after Blocking, so I started writing UTTT bot without first looking up the full rules.  i regret this decision
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Scarfield: ah yes, the relaxing UTTT xD
 cytolytic: bruh
 Astrobytes: UltimateScarf
 cytolytic: how am i good at programming yet so trash at problem solving lmfao
 Scarfield: AstroTic
 struct: Yavalath most relaxing just ask MSmits
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: Made by undefined
 Astrobytes: Or Yinsh. Nice, simple, relaxing game.
 eulerscheZahl: 2048you can relax for more than 1 hour watching the same replay
 DomiKo: Penguins are really cool
 pb4: mzbear&#160;: Trolls vs Castles
 pb4: Can always blame randomness when you lose :D
 mzbear: that sounds ... convenient ... and also annoying&#160;:) 
 DomiKo: if you like MCTS and randomness then Bandas will be great
 eulerscheZahl: so many games to chose from
 mzbear: just submitted my bronze league UTTT bot which only does one step search for local wins/losses ... i might get into the next league with this, what are these other people doing? :O 
 eulerscheZahl: and if you don't like any of them: upload your own game
 CommanderCero: what if i dont like my own games
 DomiKo: only time is the limit&#160;:(
 mzbear: ohhh... maybe I should make a game to torture you guys :D
 eulerscheZahl: guess why I uploaded so many CommanderCero&#160;;)
 mzbear: i almost started playing that tower defense game, but the lack of clear specification annoyed me, and i didn't want to read the referee's source to figure out how the attackers exactly moved
 mzbear: i like writing code against a specification, not against an implementation
 mzbear: oh, one step search wasn't enough to get out of bronze, interesting.  got rank 2 though
 pb4: Isn't the specification clear in the last version&#160;?
 pb4: have to admit I haven't read it in a long time :D
 pb4: Right, it's missing the main rule...
 eulerscheZahl: the game logic might be a little complex for the statement, causing clutter
 pb4: troll movement&#160;: one towards you if you send strictly less stones than the opponent, one towards him if you sent strictly more, no movement if you sent as many
 eulerscheZahl: so: vague description in text. details in code if you care
 struct: yavalath statement you win if you do 4  in a row but lose if you make 3 in a row
 eulerscheZahl: and you expanded that to a series of images that makes every art museum jealous
 mzbear: i meant euler's tower deference game's description
 mzbear: i have no idea what the troll game is, cant see it in the list
 eulerscheZahl: i consider TD as the worst of my contributions
 struct: I think the images are still hosted on imgur instead of CG
 eulerscheZahl: dwarfie disagrees, he really hates minesweeper
 struct: if they are ever removed I cant edit it&#160;:(
 dwarfie: i hates that i always have a random board where last move is to be played random ...
 dwarfie: and i always lose
 JBM: sounds like the real thing
 JBM: improve ton random
 struct: Just pick the opposite
 struct: ez fix
 eulerscheZahl: it's as frustrating as the original minesweeper
 dwarfie: impossible ... stilgart uses me as bad random generator ... where i am , randaom is never good :D
 eulerscheZahl: you can't make a better port

 eulerscheZahl: Fortran knows STRUCTURE too (not sure if that was part of the first version already or added later)
 philRG: DomiKo: I liked penguins also
 LastRick: For a change of pace from CSB I've been doing Mean Max for a week or so and I tell you, it is absolutely frustrating. The harder I try, the worse I rank.
 eulerscheZahl: Penguins was fun
 struct: Meanmax is harder than CSB
 LastRick: i'm beginning to recognize that
 LastRick: the gap between wood and bronze bosses feels like the Grand Canyon
 philRG: yep
 philRG: for penguins

 struct: nice
 DomiKo: yea 
 eulerscheZahl: don't touch STC :scream:
 DomiKo: I going to gold I guess
 DomiKo: I have to!
 DomiKo: STC is so grea....
 struct: You have a bug though
 DomiKo: Still????
 struct: at least on the first replay I played with your code

 DomiKo: structs its vs gold bosss
 DomiKo: I'm still in silver 
 struct: I know
 eulerscheZahl: he pulled the same "no move" thing vs me <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/515983689">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/515983689</a>
 struct: but its a bug :p
 DomiKo: my bot is just bad?
 DomiKo: that a bug?
 struct: Ofc you still have space
 struct: and placed piece on wrong place
 DomiKo: I see
 DomiKo: 3 points ahead of Silver boss that enought
 DomiKo: ehhh let's debug that mess
 struct: I was thinking on trying bitboards on STC
 struct: to see if I can manage to do it
 DomiKo: It's really weird that nobody tell anything about updating board
 struct: What do you mean updating board?
 DomiKo: after making move
 DomiKo: I should say how to fast make move
 struct: Well I keep track of columnsheight
 struct: I think it was euler that gave me that tip
 DomiKo: that help a lot
 struct: Also on pieces fall I do the same
 DomiKo: and that's why I think it's weird that nobody tell nothing
 DomiKo: there is a lot of tricks
 struct: and on pieces fall I start on minX and end on maxX
 Astrobytes: sometimes it's best to ask in chat or discord wrt certain games
 DomiKo: I know I could ask
 DomiKo: and I will
 Astrobytes: forum isn't *always* helpful
 DomiKo: Right now I have to implement everything I came up with 
 DomiKo: then I will ask how to squeeze it more
 DomiKo: but I was really shocked that forum tell nothing
 struct: Yeah
 struct: Also when I place a stone I only check for floodfill if there are &gt;= 4 blocks of that color
 struct: So I also keep track of colors
 struct: I do the same when pieces fall, I only add them to floodfill if they have &gt;= 4
 struct: There are these posts though DomiKo

 eulerscheZahl: marchete has bitboards on STC
 eulerscheZahl: tbh those posts aren't really helpful IMO
 eulerscheZahl: just play the game and see where you get
 eulerscheZahl: the tower building in the center was a little boost
 eulerscheZahl: i think i read that on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: lower risk of getting buried
 struct: I saw re curse ai and he sometimes starts on corners
 eulerscheZahl: cheater
 darkhorse64: Maybe I'm wrong but the real issue is not to compute the best combo (hence performance does not matter that much) but to strike at the right moment
 eulerscheZahl: watched some battles of me vs him. in the first attack i often get a higher score
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if he gets less points on purpose (5 skulls ready for next attack)
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, strike at the right time...
 <b>**eulerscheZahl doesn't predict the opponent</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: yeah re curse definetly does
 struct: darkhorse64 yeah perfomance should not matter much
 eulerscheZahl: always attacks 1 before me and gets me stuck
 struct: I was thinking on doing depth 4 enemy
 struct: 22^4 at worse
 DomiKo: struct yeah there are some posts
 DomiKo: but they tell "I have search"
 DomiKo: in most cases
 eulerscheZahl: i have search too :P
 darkhorse64: I have also noticed that one layer of skulls is not enough to make you lose
 DomiKo: yea is so easy to ignore one layer
 darkhorse64: Based on your search and opponent search, you can then make decisions
 DomiKo: wow gold is weird
 struct: bot strength is completely different
 DomiKo: I have like few hours to reach legend 
 DomiKo: new update will be in 3 minutes&#160;:(
 struct: update?

 DomiKo: yes&#160;:(

 reCurse: It's one of the hardest legend leagues
 struct: for first submit
 DomiKo: yeah not bad
 struct: How much time did you spend on it reCurse?
 reCurse: I forgot, let me check git history
 reCurse: Crap, I did a single commit when I submitted...
 struct: np
 reCurse: Oldest file is may 10
 reCurse: So 11 days?
 reCurse: Roughly
 reCurse: I was also in the middle of moving at that time so definitely upper bound

 struct: to check puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: clever
 struct: Quest map*
 jacek: meh
 eulerscheZahl: quest meh
 LastRick: One positive of the quest map: I've been on CG for about 5 months, finally did my first contest but really had done nothing but Puzzles. Had the entire contribution, clash and algorithm branches done. What should I do next? The compete branch said "Reach Silver in 2 games". So I went back to the bots I hadn't touched since I first joined. Got silver in CSB and it made me want to look at all the other competes.
 eulerscheZahl: there we got the puzzle notification
 jacek: wee
 jacek: too slow
 LastRick: Maybe its hard for old timers to understand this but as a newcomer, there is zero pulling you to the Compete section. I literally had no idea that the AI stuff was CG's big draw.
 eulerscheZahl: i keep saying that. you find puzzles elsewhere
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces, hackerrank, codechef, leetcode, ...
 eulerscheZahl: multiplayers are the main difference between CG and those other websites
 elcolumbio: are those puzzles better?
 eulerscheZahl: i consider puzzles on the other websites as higher quality compared to the average CG puzzle
 LastRick: good to know
 elcolumbio: even i started coding at codingbat , it was nice
 Astrobytes: yet still CG don't seem to notice
 LastRick: they don't know how they are different and thus how to market themself?
 Astrobytes: It may be changing, but I don't know if they realise that the multis are a massive thing
 elcolumbio: i think they are great. Something for mobile would be nice
 elcolumbio: by number clash of code is the biggest?
 Astrobytes: puzzles are fine but if you want straight-up no fuss technical puzzles without graphics etc. as euler says you can find more suitable elsewhere
 eulerscheZahl: seems they are planning their next big thing
 Astrobytes: I saw that
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928">https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928</a>
 eulerscheZahl: for those who didn't
 Astrobytes: theories?
 jacek: 3D UTTT
 elcolumbio: wow thats great, i mainly come here to see others peoples ideas. i still wait for my first programming job.
 eulerscheZahl: you solve a puzzle with other users. each codes a part of it
 eulerscheZahl: other guesses?
 Astrobytes: that would be so meh
 LastRick: No idea
 linjoehan: a multi clash?
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i see in that video that i fail to scale up
 Astrobytes: yeah, indeed
 Astrobytes: unless it's more of a CTF type feel
 Astrobytes: but I doubt that
 jacek: what if they are multiarmed bandits
 Astrobytes: linjoehan: I fear it may be a clash variant
 Astrobytes: then we're good jacek
 eulerscheZahl: i remember when tech.io was their new big project
 eulerscheZahl: somehow didn't work out as planned
 linjoehan: what evr happened to that thing?
 Astrobytes: It's so underused
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not saying that it's bad
 Astrobytes: *underutilised
 eulerscheZahl: just a different userbase
 eulerscheZahl: we have a big community here on CG
 Astrobytes: It could be useful for so much more
 LastRick: I think the Learn tab is the most wasted space on this site.
 eulerscheZahl: but you can't move them to tech.ioi don't need tech.io and those on tech.io don't necessarily care about CG
 LastRick: fair
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I mean there should be a lot more sections on there relating directly to CG tbh
 Astrobytes: this is true yeah
 linjoehan: There's just to much stuff there I think.
 jacek: get a job tab is more wasted imo
 Astrobytes: As a platform for teaching as it seems to be used for a lot I guess it's useful, but definitely cluttered
 Astrobytes: I always thought Get A Job was just motivation for the unemployed :P
 DomiKo: but it is not?
 LastRick: It's not set up correctly. If I go to the Learn tab, i want the filters to be subject or topic, not language. So forgetting that, say I want to learn (pun intended) A*, where is the search function to find it?
 jacek: write it your own
 jacek: thats part of learning
 Astrobytes: yeah, exactly LastRick
 Astrobytes: shuddup jacek :rofl:
 LastRick: the search function on their page, I should write that?
 Astrobytes: don't listen to Troll-In-Chief over there :D
 LastRick: oh
 eulerscheZahl: thats why i wrote my own search for puzzles
 LastRick: i guess now that I'm high enough level, I can find the puzzles through the contribute page but before then, that was an invaluable tool that you made
 Astrobytes: Oh it's still valuable once you try to load everything on that page :D
 struct: Its hard to understand whats going on the gif
 LastRick: it takes a minute
 eulerscheZahl: the puzzle page on CG has no full text search
 struct: I see 3 mouse cursors
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to find a puzzle because a similar one is pending on contribute
 linjoehan: move the mouse and use that one
 eulerscheZahl: cat tells me to go to bed, bye
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 struct: The quality of the gif doesnt help either
 Astrobytes: Way too under the dewclaw of your cat may I add :P
 LastRick: night
 struct: But it has a timer that is increasing
 Astrobytes: It'll be some new type of clash, mark my words
 Astrobytes: CG regards clash as really important because so many people play it, yet don't realise that many are just unaware there are other parts to the whole experience
 Astrobytes: *don't seem to realise
 Astrobytes: I could be wrong
 struct: 3 mouses, 1 timer, interactive viewer(?), ide
 struct: also 2 tabs on ide
 struct: After they interact with viewer a skull( boss&#160;?) appears?
 jacek: cg cyberpunk
 LastRick: so each of the users has a yellow line going from their part of the code to something in the picture? Like their assigned portion to build/beat?
 Astrobytes: something along those (pun not intended) lines it seems
 Astrobytes: It will be interesting to find out what it is anyway
 struct: Ok I managed to read what it says on ide tab
 struct: it says JukeBox
 LastRick: is that the yellow button?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/HEKQfBR.png">https://i.imgur.com/HEKQfBR.png</a>
 struct: This is what changes on ide
 struct: 3 diffent types
 Astrobytes: well they seem to click on one in the main screen, also arcade machine
 jacek: CSI: struct edition
 struct: 1 before interaction, 2nd shows after interaction and then the 3rd seems to be the same as 1 but with more lines
 struct: Is like the  last line expanded then collapsed again
 LastRick: yeah
 elcolumbio: is it 3 against 3?
 LastRick: 5 against 1?
 Astrobytes: DSI jacek, development scene investigation
 struct: 5vs1 seems more likely
 struct: Due to the 1 being at bottom right
 elcolumbio: no it is the person who made the picture. 
 struct: ah
 elcolumbio: i guess
 struct: Someone increase quality
 jacek: enhance!
 Astrobytes: &lt;enhancing intensifies&gt;
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/2078832_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/2078832_700bwp.webp</a>
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x">https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x</a>
 jacek: so NN
 Astrobytes: So weeb
 Astrobytes: Nice enhancement and all but... jeez
 Astrobytes: still, could've been ponies eh jacek
 jacek: im still searching
 Astrobytes: :scream:
 jacek: but i found something called pony waifu sim. interesting...
 Astrobytes: ...to some and not to most
 struct: 200$ to enchance
 struct: Damn
 reCurse: Well DLSS is pretty much SOTA for enhancing these days I think.
 reCurse: Not sure nvidia cared about animes though.
 reCurse: Nevermind it's not about images
 Astrobytes: any thoughts on the twitter gif reCurse?
 reCurse:&#160;?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928">https://twitter.com/FDesmoulins/status/1336720001550716928</a>
 Astrobytes: the root of this convo
 Astrobytes: ah, was quite far up in the history, my apologies
 reCurse: Ah yes I can see why
 reCurse: Looks like early 2000s youtube geez
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Astrobytes: Deliberately I would guess
 reCurse: err 2010
 Astrobytes: 00s, 10's, w/e
 struct: The challenge is to make an AI to enhance video
 reCurse: New dimension of collaboration and inclusion? Meh.
 Astrobytes: I am of the belief it's clash 2.0
 reCurse: Coop clash :scream:
 reCurse: Yeah that's very likely actually
 Astrobytes: Or something along those lines
 reCurse: Makes sense
 reCurse: But oh boy is it out of my interest sphere
 struct: I really hope its not clash
 Astrobytes: Same.
 reCurse: Collaborating with other devs is hell enough as it is, don't need a game about it
 elcolumbio: i hope its a clash
 reCurse: That would be like making chore simulator
 reCurse: Why
 jacek: goat simulator
 Astrobytes: I was saying earlier how CG recognises it has loads of clashers, yet seems to fail to realise that half the clashers don't know about any other part of the site and what it has to offer.
 jacek: i think even remi didnt know until later
 reCurse: I'd say they don't care probably
 reCurse: If you care about coding you'd stay out of clash
 Astrobytes: In conjunction with the fact that other sites are better for puzzles and multis are their one differing strong point...
 reCurse: Ok ok turning the edginess down
 Astrobytes: OK boomer :P
 reCurse: Alright bumping smoothiness to max
 reCurse: Clashes are a unique side of CG so capitalizing on it makes sense
 reCurse: I don't think clashers are in lack of exposure to other elements
 reCurse: They just prefer clashing
 elcolumbio: i know there are other challenges and i like clashes, because they are fast and give you a good feeling. 
 reCurse: That's as nice as I'm willing to get
 Astrobytes: Haha. But seriously, oh yeah ofc, it's a huge drawing point. I donno, I come across a lot of people that didn't have a clue anything else existed.
 Astrobytes: Heh.
 elcolumbio: but do they have the will and time to invest so much time?
 reCurse: Of course not
 Astrobytes: No, which is what clashes are intended for. 'Fun' for 15 minutes.
 reCurse: Well it's a fun distraction as long as you don't pretend it's for anything else
 struct: Well a coop clash that lasts at least 30 minutes
 reCurse: Like becoming a better coder
 Astrobytes: I was about to get onto that yes
 Astrobytes: Many view it as a serious endeavour. Take that guy the other day thinking they were like coding interview questions. I blame the internet, personally. YouTube specifically.
 Westicles: They should add all puzzles to golf, that would stir things up a bit
 reCurse: They are like coding interview questions, just for an inverse correlation
 elcolumbio: can we agree it is like bullet chess. 
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: No no no no
 reCurse: NO
 jacek: hows the chess going
 reCurse: Who me?
 Astrobytes: Let me rephrase: thinking they were going to help him with coding interview questions
 jacek: you worked on chess or not?
 reCurse: Oh, I was thinking helping employers weed out candidates
 reCurse: Yeah, still am
 reCurse: Engine is done, viewer is um... 80% there
 reCurse: Still need to implement crazy rules
 reCurse: And work on the bot protocol
 Astrobytes: Looking forward to it
 jacek: its antimsmits variant?
 reCurse: Chess960 yes
 reCurse: Because fuck opening theory
 jacek: and crazyhouse because fck endtables
 reCurse: Well I'm undecided on crazy
 reCurse: I'll put it as an initialization input
 struct: e4 thats all the theory I know
 reCurse: Have 2 parts to submission
 reCurse: See what happens
 reCurse: One with and one without
 reCurse: Also seed=0 to have standard initial position, but only for ide
 Astrobytes: Nice. Seems all the bases are covered
 Astrobytes: I won't touch it until after RAIC
 struct: So if seed would create standard board, you do some stuff to the seed?
 Astrobytes: If it comes before the end of that
 reCurse: Yeah. Wasted a few hours to get font and piece rendering right. Fun times.
 reCurse: The seed is used to generate the initial row
 reCurse: Following chess960 method
 Astrobytes: I saw the font issue on discord yeah, glorious JS
 reCurse: I got rid of the scaling trick, just picked better size and colors after much trial and error...
 reCurse: Web canvas is pain
 Astrobytes: Fair play
 reCurse: How many 50ms turns do we have max btw?
 reCurse: 400/player for 2?
 reCurse: Was that it?
 struct: 600
 struct: for 2
 reCurse: So 300/player?
 struct: yes
 reCurse: Ok.
 reCurse: So I can do pairs inside one game
 reCurse: Auto-draw at move 150
 reCurse: Lovely
 jacek: pairs?
 reCurse: Oh that's going to mess up player colors...
 reCurse: Ack
 reCurse: Yeah play as both white and black on same configuration
 reCurse: Use 2 points as end result
 jacek: so 1.5 == 2?
 reCurse: Makes better use of the ridiculously low amount of games
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: That just made me realize I may have wasted my time on that font rendering...
 reCurse: ffs
 Astrobytes: Flexible C++ CG SDK Dreams
 reCurse: Nah it's my bad I should have realized there was no point of having a nice black rendering if they were going to switch sides, now I'd be better off using standard player colors
 Astrobytes: Wasn't really a response to that, just fantasising out loud.I'm completely put off by the Java
 reCurse: Oh.
 Astrobytes: And the JS
 Astrobytes: Tis what it is, however.
 reCurse: The JS is optional
 Astrobytes: True.
 reCurse: If you don't mind using the CG abstraction
 Westicles: Anyone know the criteria for the moderation bot?
 reCurse: Probably best left unanswered
 jacek: AutomatonNN what are the criteria?
 AutomatonNN: code version is already a complete solution
 Westicles: Minimum 20 votes and &lt;2.5 score?
 reCurse: How about you try not to break things this time?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, there's no need for proof of concept.
 Westicles: I don't know how I could break that.  I just wanted to know which puzzles need to be done soon before they go away
 reCurse: Hmm ok
 LastRick: Puzzles go away?
 Astrobytes: Contributions?
 Westicles: Accepted puzzles that get downvoted.  Seems pretty rare
 Giselus: Hello guys&#160;:)
 Giselus: I have some question
 Giselus: Is it possible to challenge my friends in bot programming?
 Giselus: I ask if I can watch just one duel between my and my friend's bot
 struct: only if they are in top 1000
 Astrobytes: Only if they are within... ^ this :D
 Giselus: If the game has less than 1000 players can we duel at any time, or should we get some higher league?
 Giselus: I've tried only one game so far, so I don't know if it works the same everywhere
 struct: You should be able to
 struct: unless he is in a higher league than you
 Giselus: Thanks you guys&#160;:)
 DomiKo: oho
 DomiKo: top5 in STC is hard&#160;:(
 DomiKo: in gold&#160;:(
 Giselus: What is stc? :x
 DomiKo: Smash the Code
 struct: I remember how I made it
 Giselus: Oh, I get it
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/ylBtNEV.png">https://i.imgur.com/ylBtNEV.png</a>
 DomiKo: xD
 DomiKo: 30 here
 Astrobytes: goddamnit. My computer/office chair just died. Now sitting on one of the good dining chairs from downstairs
 struct:&#160;:/
 DomiKo: :frowning2:
 Astrobytes: 'good dining chairs' - who am I kidding. Chairs from my dinner table :DBut yeah, was on it's way out all week, now it goes backwards at any angle and crunches a lot.
 Astrobytes: *all last week
 AntiSquid: time for new fancy chair&#160;?!
 struct: DomiKo you still do very early combos
 AntiSquid: you need something better for your back anyway 
 DomiKo: ehhh
 struct: example
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/516031733">https://www.codingame.com/replay/516031733</a>
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: my old chair was good for it tbh, just not any more. And without advice it's hard to get one to suit my specific need
 LastRick: Oh come on! I beat that cat by a mile! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/516056025?f=300">https://www.codingame.com/replay/516056025?f=300</a>
 Xx__THK__xX: Uhh hey guys, so apparently  when I host a private clash the difficulty of the clash are way easier than a public one
 Xx__THK__xX: Is there a way to increase the difficulty?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516060913">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/516060913</a>
 DomiKo: struct you have a bug
 Xedux: hello @ejle
 Xedux: @ejle
 Xedux: could you share your previous clash code program&#160;?
 mzbear: argh, the editor glitched and desynced source with the analysis, so it no longer recognizes one of the function names, thinking it's garbled instead .... so the entire code is full of red error lines but it runs and works correctly

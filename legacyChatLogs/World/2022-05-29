 Hunter64TheOne2: Hello can someone (please) help me learn c++ and python? Thank you.
 noobcoder42: just code and start practice 
 Hunter64TheOne2: yes, I thought so, but...
 jacek: jrke how big is your model?
 jacek: if small enough, you can manually copy &amp; paste the weights ;d
 jacek: oware battles revived eh
 DomiKo: a lot of people submitting I see :D

 Youssif_Ekadi: joe mama
 Wizard-Dude: when will the next competition start?
 5DN1L: no news yet
 jrke: jacek i am just asking which libraries i can use whose weight can be put on CG
 jrke: like stable baselines3?
 Uljahn: there is no special ML/DL/AI support on CG, other than general purpose libraries such as numpy
 j4at: We need tensorflow&#160;:'(
 j4at: or even better pytorch
 DomiKo: numpy is really enough
 j4at: Converting my model from pytorch to numpy is a pain in the ass.. Because the model is complicated
 DomiKo: I'm doing the same and it's like 20 lines of code for me
 DomiKo: you only need to take 2D/3D arrays from your array 
 DomiKo: notthing special
 j4at: What about the operations  MultiheadAttention, custom PositionalEncoding and other custom layers, i'm using. I need to convert everything to numpy. But well it's understandable why they can't add pytorch/tensorflow.
 struct: I dont understand the training part well enough yet
 Alif005: same
 jacek: im not aware of 'easy' way to convert weights from libs to your needs. one plus for doing all the stuff yourself :v

 JabaDUDE: Hey guys new to the site. Seems like a fun way to get good but... uh... well you see, and this is awkward, I have no idea wtf I'm doing. Can anyone assist me
 JabaDUDE: Kindly,
 JabaDUDE: Jabadude
 5DN1L: Have you learned any programming languages before?
 JabaDUDE: I'm learning my first one, Javascript
 Razovsky: haaaaa
 Razovsky: noooooooooo
 5DN1L: You see, this is a practice website rather than a tutorial website
 Razovsky: nothing can save you
 JabaDUDE: My problem isn't the language, it's how to navigate the site and understanding what i'm looking at
 Razovsky: flee
 5DN1L: JabaDUDE you can practise by playing puzzles here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 5DN1L: and you can play multi-player games here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>

 JabaDUDE: Im doing the training and looking at The Descent, I guess I'm not sure what its wanting me to do. 
 Wizard-Dude: question, how would I calculate the impulse of two objects when they collide, if both objects have a mass of 1 and all I know the velocity of both objects?  
 jacek: youre probably struggling with input/output stuff
 jacek: even more advanced people are struggling at first
 5DN1L: JabaDUDE you're supposed to revise/complete the code so that it will solve all the test cases/validators
 5DN1L: you read the inputs, process them, and write the answers as outputs
 5DN1L: write refers to "console.log" in javascript
 jacek: in the hints you even have complete solution. but generally you have, in loop, the list of mountains in inputs and you need to print desired output in each iteration of loop
 JabaDUDE: I know that, I guess I'm confused by the text. Am I shooting the last mountain or am I shooting all the mountains?
 5DN1L: that is just visualisation
 jacek: shoot the highest mountain
 5DN1L: what you really have to do is to deal with text inputs and outputs
 JabaDUDE: gotcha, so I'm just outputing the last index
 5DN1L: outputing the index of the highest mountain
 5DN1L: index in the list of heights you are given
 struct: Hi YurkovAS I see you are also doing STC, are you using random search?
 5DN1L: e.g. if inputs = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]
 5DN1L: you output 0
 5DN1L: because 7 is index 0 in the inputs
 jacek: Wizard-Dude if youre doing simulation for mad pod racing i think there are some implementations already
 JabaDUDE: Ok so each turn the 'high mountain' will be a diff index and my code has to locate it thru loop, and 'fire it'
 5DN1L: yup
 JabaDUDE: Gotcha. I guess I was reading too much into the description. Thank you.

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Wontonimo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 27 tacos
 Wontonimo: yeah
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: how's it going struct?
 struct: good, trying to finish my stc bot
 struct: what about you?
 struct: are working on something?
 Wontonimo: nope.  I've been chatting just a tiny bit with jacek and ImSeaFu about NNs
 Wontonimo: don't know if I've been a help
 Wontonimo: probably I'd be able to help more once I actually use NN on CG
 struct: you should try it
 struct: I would help if I had a clue how to do one 
 struct: lol
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: :grin: thanks
 struct: I could help writing the past forward stuff in c++ in avx or something
 Wontonimo: that would be cool.  there's lots here on CG to start with in the playgrounds
 struct: I probably should ignore math and just try to do it
 struct: what can go wrong :rolling_eyes:
 Wontonimo: not much really.  maybe a crash course in matrix math just so that you stop thinking in "neurons" and instead think in terms of connections (the matrix operations)
 Wontonimo: because the connections are the important part.  the neurons (nodes) are not.
 Wontonimo: the nodes (neurons) are just the output, not the operation
 struct: I think i understand that part
 struct: just stopped at how it learns
 struct: on how it changes weights
 Wontonimo: use tensorflow during training.  it does the weight changes automatically
 Wontonimo: oh follow jacek's playground and just use c++
 Wontonimo: but then you don't have all extra bells and whistles of tensorflow&#160;;(
 struct: his xor one?

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Wontonimo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 28 tacos
 j4at: :taco: Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [auto] j4at has awarded Wontonimo 7 tacos. Wontonimo now has 35 taco. j4at now has 8 taco
 Wontonimo: you sir are a saint
 j4at: (:
 Wontonimo: what are you working on j4at?
 j4at: Im almost done with my AI
 Wontonimo: what will this AI do?
 j4at: the spider attack one
 Wontonimo: nice.  what kind of stuff are you putting in your AI?
 Wontonimo: i see you are already at silver, nice
 j4at: That's just hardcoded. So the AI can be trained to play level 3 only.
 Wontonimo: what algorithm(s) are you using?
 j4at: Im using an encoding transformer neural network. I don't know if you read about transformers yet. but this is my architecture
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/C91HKtG">https://ibb.co/C91HKtG</a>
 j4at: lol
 j4at: self recursive ofc
 j4at: forgot a line <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/sJLwkhs">https://ibb.co/sJLwkhs</a>
 j4at: "output" is more like "output state"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: look at NN sim of the human eye, i think they do image recog. with 20+ layers of 'intermediate' nodes
 j4at: Will do
 j4at: More accurate <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/Chn3nkn">https://ibb.co/Chn3nkn</a>
 Wontonimo: and how is it doing so far?  do you have an intermediate result replay?
 j4at: I didn't test it yet to be real
 j4at: I found a trick tho in RL
 j4at: Do you know about ddpg&#160;?
 Wontonimo: nope, reading it now
 Wontonimo: ah, seems pretty straight forward in concept, learn a value and policy.  kinda what alpha does
 Wontonimo: but for RL
 Wontonimo: and how is the training going?  do you have any metrics to indicate how good it is compared to your current silver bot?
 j4at: Its only playing against itself. So have no metrics but hopefully tomorrow I will have some
 Wontonimo: with old saves you can see how many generations of absolute defeat there are.  For example, let's say you have
 Wontonimo: about 500 saves of previous best versions.  Starting with version 1, find the next version that wins against it 90% of the time.  Maybe that is version 12.
 j4at: Yes I know I finished working on it like few hours ago So I didn't test anything yet
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f99a6c50-b05e-4882-b912-0d5b8550a910">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f99a6c50-b05e-4882-b912-0d5b8550a910</a>
 Wontonimo: Then repeat finding the version that beats version 12 90% of the time
 Wontonimo: when you got the 500th (or whatever your current version is) how many 90% win/loss levels is it ahead
 Wontonimo: your solution to use 2 agents and 2 critics is interesting
 Wontonimo: what kind of metrics do you have to see if it is improving?
 j4at: Well, I will start but making it play again my hard coded version and then make it play with older versions
 j4at: because ofc it can overfit if i make it train with my hardcoded version
 j4at: Well I can use the hardcoded version only as a metric i'm sleepy :3
 j4at: for now
 j4at: not for training
 Wontonimo: very interesting stuff&#160;!
 j4at: So, the critic lowers the score of actor's action prediction and that makes the actor tries to output a good action but different action than previous ones, self explore :o. The thing I'm scared about tho is if the actor will not try "bad" actions at all. So I might neeed to add some randomness&#160;? Or I might just need to play with the 3 different learning rates and makes them change differntly.
 Wontonimo: have you used this architecture on something more simple, like 3x3 tic tac toe&#160;?
 j4at: Not yet, I need to do a lot of tests :3 in my defense I came out with it like 2 days ago.
 j4at: I tested the NN architecture tho

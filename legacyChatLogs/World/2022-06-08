 AryanTripathi: wdym Westicles?
 Westicles: there is a rule about clashes with only two outputs, like true/false
 Husoski: "Binary outputs" refers to a problem which only has two possible results, like 0/1, True/False, Yes/No, etc.  It's too easy to guess to get a 50% score
 AryanTripathi: hmm
 AryanTripathi: i've an idea
 AryanTripathi: maybe I should ask them to print the health of the grasshopper?
 AryanTripathi: If it is below 0 or equal to 0, you've to print "Dead"
 AryanTripathi: *dead* lmao
 5DN1L: yeah, some more fitting description is always better than a generic word "false"
 AryanTripathi: yep
 AryanTripathi: done :thumbsup:
 5DN1L: Guess I'll have to wait for CG to fully upload your changes first
 AryanTripathi: it's updated now
 AryanTripathi: feel free to tell me if there's any type of mistake
 5DN1L: :ok_hand_tone1:

 Sephirious: What I dont get is, at the Clash for shortest code; of course people who write it with python are gonna get shorter character than C++
 Sephirious: Why is it like that&#160;?
 AryanTripathi: bruh
 AryanTripathi: cuz python is easier
 AryanTripathi: and c++ is a bit harder
 5DN1L: that doesn't explain shorter/longer code
 AryanTripathi: lol
 AryanTripathi: in c++ you need to import modules and other things that makes your code long, that's why you will see less people coding in cc++
 AryanTripathi: *c++
 Zexion: You're competing against other people, there are languages better for golfing. It is on your side to choose the best language that suits your goal
 AryanTripathi: in c++ it is important to import modules, but in python modules are imported when needed
 5DN1L: yes, AryanTripathi, and all the main, all the brackets, all the semicolons
 5DN1L: for python, indentation
 AryanTripathi: yep true true

 5DN1L: Good to know, but this channel is English only
 5DN1L: Please go to #cn channel for Chinese
 Husoski: b0ot One thing to do when "thinking recursively" is to assume that you have all smaller cases solved.  It's a lot like mathematical induction.
 Niminos: the logic of my first program is better than most of yours&#160;:)
 Niminos: i cannot understand how to know which project to choose 
 Niminos: because you cannot know the expertiseGain before studying it
 5DN1L: Code4Life?
 Niminos: y
 eulerscheZahl: ignore project until gold or even legend
 eulerscheZahl: just complete your samples
 eulerscheZahl: also the experience gain for each sample is given as input after you diagnose it
 Niminos: wow that's rude :p
 Niminos: but okok
 struct: jacek on search race do you use more than 3 angles?
 jacek: what do you mean 3 angles?
 DomiKo: -18, 0, 18
 jacek: i use [-18;18], all ints
 Wontonimo: i use all ints
 waterproofsodium: gm gm
 Wontonimo: actually i do -25 to 25 then truncate to -18 to 18.  you may think that is crazy, but it worked better for my GA
 struct: I tried adding a bit more angles but my bot refuses to use them
 waterproofsodium: struct I just solved your clash
 eulerscheZahl: jacek even uses all speeds in [0,200]
 waterproofsodium: the multiply and sum
 eulerscheZahl: n*n*(n+1)/2
 Wontonimo: the volume of a wedge?
 Wontonimo: with a square base
 eulerscheZahl: no story behind
 Wontonimo: what algo are you using for search race struct&#160;?
 struct: I copied my beam search from spring challenge 2021
 Wontonimo: from Totoro&#160;?
 ycsvenom: V=(bh/6)(2a+c)Wontonimo
 struct: yes
 ycsvenom: this should be it
 Wontonimo: reusing totoro code for search race :thinking: very interesting
 struct: wontonimo the clash is basicly I give N and they need to do n * n + n - 1 * n + n - 2 * n
 struct: until n - x meets 0
 struct: I forgot parenthesis 
 struct: I had MC before but just copy pasting was like 600 points difference
 Wontonimo: for the beam, what's the criteria you use for pruning the beam?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/476003c4859dea368c1587acc951182556c">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/476003c4859dea368c1587acc951182556c</a>
 Wontonimo: in search race
 eulerscheZahl: there is no x
 struct: The evaluation of the state
 struct: number of checkpoints crossed and  distance to next
 struct: basically its magu s eval from csb tutorial I guess
 waterproofsodium: oh eulerscheZahl that formula was for me?
 waterproofsodium: nice
 struct: yes waterproofsodium
 waterproofsodium: struct no timeout for using a loop? :D
 jacek: i use distance to (next checkpoint - 1 * vel)
 waterproofsodium: maybe you intended cause I had to use long
 struct: nah
 Wontonimo: hmm, struct your beam destroys my GA in search race
 struct: it did way better than my MC
 struct: and its using 0ms
 struct: 2*ms
 struct: I would have copied chokudai but the beam that I used with it is slightly different
 struct: wont work here
 struct: holy
 Wontonimo: moly&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: moly?
 eulerscheZahl: damn
 DomiKo: damnnn
 struct: this submit was good
 struct: lol
 DomiKo: what happend?
 struct: I wont from 12.7k to 11.1k
 struct: went*
 DomiKo: damnnn
 jacek: RNG?
 struct: no
 struct: it still uses depth 10
 struct: I just did - vel
 struct: like you said
 eulerscheZahl: you just bypassed me&#160;:(
 DomiKo: yeah it's a magic trick
 Wontonimo: it's as if taking into account velocity is useful
 Wontonimo: in a physics based challenge
 eulerscheZahl: -v in what way?
 struct: in eval
 struct: - dist(nextCheckpoint.pos - pod.vel)
 DomiKo: now try - 3 * v
 struct: something like that
 Wontonimo: or run a search over N for -N*v
 jacek: do meta GA
 struct: maybe ill play with beam a bit more
 jacek: does it still use only 3 angles?
 struct: yes
 struct: and only depth 10
 struct: with 1800 width
 Wontonimo: _someone_ used to call GA "garbage algorithm" , and seeing as BEAM just destroys it then I'd say that description is kinda appropriate here :O
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't work <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/639889981">https://www.codingame.com/replay/639889981</a>
 struct: do you take into account number of crossed checkpoints?
 LandinW: oh yeah baby just won a small coding clash with cpp 
 jacek: code golf?
 Wontonimo: congrats
 eulerscheZahl: must be something with that
 LandinW: nvm somone just came in with 1/5 size  program 4mins later
 struct: i do check * 50'000 - what I said
 LandinW:&#160;:(
 struct: check = crossed
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't do the trick for me. meh, i don't feel like trying
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, you wrote- dist(nextCheckpoint.pos - pod.vel)
 Wontonimo: i do checked*10'000 - distance to next checkpoint - 3v
 eulerscheZahl: i did:- dist(nextCheckpoint.pos, pod.vel)
 eulerscheZahl: dist to what even? the current car pos?
 struct: yes
 struct: pod.pos.distance(nextcheckpoint.pos - pod.vel)
 j4at: Yeah GA is really not that good. Evolution strategies is a better alternative atleast in my experience.
 Wontonimo: and 15 move lookahead
 SalvG: ehi guys, does anyone know what is the input of "Everything" test case in "Moves in maze"?
 SalvG: i get an error, but the output is correct
 jacek: what error
 jacek: do you have additional space or newline
 SalvG: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8232ba76-219b-448d-a3c1-402c8d73e458">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8232ba76-219b-448d-a3c1-402c8d73e458</a>
 SalvG: no
 jacek: w00t
 SalvG: it says that validators give me an incorrect answer to "prevent hard coded solutions". weird, think I ve used bfs right
 5DN1L: It just means the validators are different from the test cases, and your code can fail if it can't pass the validators
 5DN1L: And how do you know your output is correct if you don't know the input?
 jacek: everything test and validator are different
 SalvG: I pass all the test cases, but when i submit i don't (just for some of them)
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5651281d-286d-4059-801e-66aab2c477a2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5651281d-286d-4059-801e-66aab2c477a2</a>
 5DN1L: It's also a good idea to build some small custom cases to test your code as well
 SalvG: thanks @jacek, I checked the output and it is different.. but for some reason i get the green light
 SalvG: and the first line of my output is "free(): invalid next size (fast)" anyone know what it means?
 jacek: could be many things, for example delete already deleted pointer

 jacek: is the depth fixed? youre doing eval from the same depth?
 struct: yes
 struct: jacek do you also have the problem where you cant use the 50ms?
 jacek: im using 30ms
 jacek: and still ocassionally timeout
 struct: yeah thats what I used on MC I think
 struct: I think I use like 11 depth on that submit
 DomiKo: 30ms for me too

 jacek: no search, just outputs angle and thrust and clip the exceeds
 kann1er: whant does i&amp;1 mean
 jacek: if i is odd its 1, if i is even its 0
 SandmanSW96: should mean if the last bit of i is 1?
 SandmanSW96: yeah what he said lol
 SandmanSW96: same as %2
 struct: nice jacek, have you ever tried eval based NN on search race?

 Wontonimo: what's the chat thing?
 struct: being removed I guess
 Westicles: moving chat to a site they can't reach from work, where they usually spend the whole day chatting here
 Wontonimo: i thought maybe there was something else
 struct: top 20 finally
 struct: I think Im done with this
 Wontonimo: and the end of chat has been chatted about for about half a year ... and it's always been 2 weeks away
 Wontonimo: what did you do to get there&#160;?
 struct: just beam search
 struct: with dynamic depth
 Wontonimo: fancy
 Wontonimo: what's the logic around dynamic depth (as opposed to growing width)
 struct: well I start with a big width but search deeper
 struct: with growing width you will repeat the early states too many times I think
 Wontonimo: so, you just have a fixed width and grow the depth until you run out of time&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: classic beam search then
 MSmits: yeah that's just beam search
 Wontonimo: can i see a replay of hold the line&#160;?

 Wontonimo: i don't see how
 Wontonimo: turning with and without thrust is different

 darkhorse64: My best solution is also a BS but my eval probably sucks. He he, I talk too much. I have the same timeouts issues
 struct: my bot still does something weird on last checkpoint for some reason
 alxdip123: maybe because the checkpoints are so close to each other that it interferes with your logic

 struct: You can add your bot there I think
 struct: check line 19
 jscarle: The clashes that are size based don't play fair against all languages.
 j4at: ty, struct&#160;:)
 jscarle: Is there a way for this not to open a new chat window for every clash?
 b0n5a1: yes wait a few days...the chat will no longer exists :D
 Aldo_Baldo: i just started playing but i think i'm addicted now..
 Netsmile: where will the chat go?
 Netsmile: this right hand panel will dissapear?
 struct: yes
 struct: It will move to discord...
 Netsmile: cool
 Char1i3: is there a way to complete a clash after the timer runs out? I'm still learning so can't always finish in time but would still like to finish for the practice

 struct: search it there
 Char1i3: thanks for that
 jscarle: Python = 63 charactersC# = 164 characters
 jscarle: Impossible to win
 SandmanSW96: lol c# in golf is futile, i use it to practice Linq anymore
 AlMag: they refer to CoC. I also hate "shortest mode" one liners where python always wins
 SandmanSW96: clashes were a bigger deal but now they're still pretty handy to just get practice, work on new and/or better ways etc
 Mehdi_Maesta: i agree with you
 Aldo_Baldo: why is that so?
 jscarle: There are substantial differences in syntax between languages which makes C# impossible to compete with Python for shortest code.
 jscarle: CoC should be constrained to developers using the same language.
 jscarle: For example, Python can use input() and print(). C# MUST use Console.ReadLine and Console.WriteLine.
 jscarle: Right there makes the rest impossible.
 jscarle: Not to mention that C# is strongly typed and Python is not.
 jscarle: So whilst Python can do v = 0, the bare minimum for C# is var v = 0;
 Aldo_Baldo: yeah sure, i meant why &gt; it was a bigger deal and then it became less popular?
 Westicles: all right, we moved you to the top of the list

 Tbone1212: Does anyone know how to fix getting an error that was from a previous code
 Wontonimo: submit new code
 Tbone1212: Well it is a completely new challenge and there is no text but its just blank space underlined with an error that clearly isn't there

 AryanTripathi: I just won 3 clashes consecutively but still my achievement isn't completed
 AryanTripathi: sed life
 AlexCibotaru777: my brain is melting with this code
 AlexCibotaru777: i can't do anything
 AlexCibotaru777: apparently im too dumb for coding.

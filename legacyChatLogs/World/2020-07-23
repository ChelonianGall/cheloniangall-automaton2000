 eulerscheZahl: math and coding are closely related
 eulerscheZahl: and have you ever tried to study computer science at University?you'll get a lot of math lectures
 Kariin: yeah I did but irl i don't need to remember formulas and stuff
 Kariin: there's google for that
 Kariin: my brain got lazy for math
 SaadAhmed1: hi
 linjoehan: I like both actually i like math more. The truth is that most CS jobs won't require much math, but it's usually the guy that knows the math that makes that page load in 3 seconds compared to the old version that takes 10x longer.
 linjoehan: I think
 abt8601: Mathematics is required to solve some problems. And programming itself is closely related to mathematics. Maybe have a look at this.
 macobo: Math is puzzle-solving and programming is puzzle-solving. Quite different, yet so similar.
 hanzhere: why cannot launch clash game?
 [CG]Thibaud: what do you mean hanzhere&#160;?
 ThomPouce: Yeah, after countdown, the game is not starting
 Allis: Glitching here too.
 ThomPouce: and the countdown restarts
 [CG]Thibaud: with F5 maybe&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: let's see
 Allis: I noticed something was up when one of my submissions got stuck on "Pending..."
 [CG]Thibaud: ok I'm informing the devs
 Allis: Thank you. Any sort of ETA?
 ThomPouce: Thank you
 [CG]Thibaud: I'd say 10 minutes

 AmarjitSingh: you have 30 secs left to change your life
 AmarjitSingh: 10
 ad99526: 10 secs
 AmarjitSingh: 9

 jacek: :f
 OrsosAdam: How can I only join for a specific clash?
 OrsosAdam: I don't want to play Reverse, but gladly play the others
 Astrobytes: OrsosAdam You can only do that within a private clash
 toby666999: Hello?
 toby666999: Anybody Here?
 toby666999: I have a question
 vitnsk:&#160;?
 toby666999: How should I do of the Security Check
 vitnsk: captcha
 toby666999: I have no captcha on my browser
 toby666999: :confused:
 toby666999: Why?
 vitnsk: it's your browser
 vitnsk: try another one
 toby666999: But I tried another browser
 toby666999: There isn't a captcha on it
 vitnsk: connectivity issue with recaptcha services?
 toby666999: I don't know
 toby666999: There only a pictrue of Clash Of Code and 2 sentenses on it
 toby666999: Security CheckClash of Code is meant for human coders only, please prove you aren't a bot!
 toby666999: There aren't any thing under the sentenses.
 jacek: i think recaptcha is blocked in china
 Astrobytes: ^ this
 toby666999: ...
 Astrobytes: Maybe you can get around it with VPN? I'm not sure
 toby666999: What is VPN？
 toby666999: hello?
 toby666999: I'm going to have my dinner
 toby666999: ttyl
 Astrobytes: sorry was afk, it's a way of protecting your anonymity online, very few work for China however
 remi6: I think it is a serious issue if people of a whole country are not able to play CoC because the site uses Google's services.
 Astrobytes: It really is pretty awful
 jacek: hmm, maybe should report to discord
 Astrobytes: The counter-argument is to blame Chinese government, but there must be a way that works for everyone
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure something can be done about it, there are other non-Google security checks right?
 remi6: Alternatives certainly exist. Cloudflare switched to hCaptcha recently for example.
 Astrobytes: I'll put a message in the bug thread on discord
 Astrobytes: Alright, reported.

 Astrobytes: DeWill, just ask if anyone wants to clash, then send them the link if they do
 toby666999: Thanks

 Astrobytes: in PM I mean!
 Astrobytes: So as not to fill the chat with clash links&#160;;)
 wlesavo: lol, nice one
 Astrobytes: In retrospect it seems I should have been more clear
 SunnySponge_3235: any java geek here?
 SunnySponge_3235: want some help
 AntiSquid: DeWill no clash invite links in main chat please.
 AntiSquid: ever!
 DeWill: ok...:thumbsup:
 jacek: java geek?
 MSmits: a jeek
 jacek: kotlin ways would be keek
 MSmits: and rust would be reek
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: look at this test:
 MSmits: 14:05:03,587 INFO   Temporary results for othello.cpp (ETA&#160;: 39 minutes)&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0247bdc6-6c2b-4a41-b021-b5972075643b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0247bdc6-6c2b-4a41-b021-b5972075643b</a>
 MSmits: rps is nuts, i didnt even try for it to work for dbdr, i just maximize for total winrate
 MSmits: still not worth submitting though
 dbdr: definitely not&#160;;)
 MSmits: I wonder if there even is one that beats everyone. Doubt it, but we'll see
 dbdr: maybe it's because many bots are *almost* deterministic?
 MSmits: yeah thats usually the case
 dbdr: well, minimax should be more than MCTS I think
 dbdr: no randomness involved, just timing
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats why i have such an easy time on yavalath also
 MSmits: except vs the mcts bots
 dbdr: well, the mcts introduces the randomness, yes
 MSmits: even without random rollout
 MSmits: it's much more sensitive to timing
 MSmits: because iterative deepening always gives the same result
 MSmits: except on deeper levels
 MSmits: and there are only 2 possibilities basically
 MSmits: either you get another level or you dont
 MSmits: so on any game state you will do at most 2 possible moves
 MSmits: unless the eval is equal and you random, this helps...
 dbdr: not exactly, because of TT
 MSmits: oh thats true, if you keep it from earlier turns
 dbdr: I mean it affects later turns, even if you have the same result
 MSmits: not if you only keep from current turn
 LoGos: Hi. sorry for interrupting. What is TT?
 MSmits: transposition tables
 dbdr: transposition table
 LoGos: Thank you both
 MSmits: getting the same gamestate via a different series of moves
 MSmits: or sometimes just by making a different move
 MSmits: this last bit is usually true for symmetric gamestates
 MSmits: i had a thought the other day. Othello is really weird for having only 1 unique move as a first move
 MSmits: basically the opening board is not the opening board
 dbdr: yeah
 MSmits: because it really starts at ply 2
 MSmits: btw dbdr, do you have a simple eval like me&gt;?
 MSmits: i mean besides the probcut stuff
 dbdr: no, I evaluate patterns
 dbdr: probcut is not an eval
 jacek: so, ntuples as well
 jacek: and MSmits,  i think its worh submitting
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: gotta pull down the rus abit
 MSmits: will be a while before i submit&#160;:)
 Schwase: just figured out network cabling. i feel so dumb
 jacek: hmm swap rule wouldnt be interesting in othello, would it :v
 whitedeath: hello
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: lol no... swap rule would be totally useless
 MSmits: but since they believe it will be solved as a draw it's not necessary
 G-Rom: Ctrl-F5 home page&#160;;)
 jrke: Is there any refree link for langton's ant?
 MSmits: it's on the forum
 MSmits: check the discussion page, I think it was in there
 jrke: does cg website home page changed
 jrke: or my net issue?
 G-Rom: yes it has been updated with a quest map
 jacek: yay free exp
 jrke: hmm looks good
 ntsd: Man
 ntsd: just know it
 ntsd: the quest map
 jrke: thanks to new quest now level 24
 ntsd: now 22
 jrke: oh now 25
 ntsd: you're growing so fast
 ntsd: I'm stop now
 jrke: also filled 900 in level 25
 ntsd: I move from 20 to 22
 jrke: ah now 26
 jrke: now stopped
 jrke: i went 23 to 26
 eulerscheZahl: am i supposed to see the quest maps of other users?
 eulerscheZahl: or is this a private thing?
 jrke: hmm same ques also rised in my mind
 G-Rom: @eulerscheZahl this is not a big deal if you see it but no you can't if you navigate normally. We're reworking the profile so that it displays more things
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 tobk: Uh, free XP just for clicking on things...
 G-Rom: you're level 34, these things were not totally free&#160;;) 
 dbdr: today CG is a clicker game :D
 tobk: yeah, but now I get more XP for stuff I already did. In fact, looking at all those bubbles might be enough to get me to level 35&#160;:-D
 G-Rom: a short clicker&#160;;)
 jrke: :smiley:
 jrke: this update gave me level 26 from 23 
 jrke: 3 level increase
 tobk: I like the "where to go next" thing, but the "free" XP is a bit excessive
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to click it&#160;;)
 tobk: Oh, if you think that you do not know me...
 [CG]Thibaud: also, the experience is different when you're starting CG
 [CG]Thibaud: and doing all the quests 1 by 1
 jrke: maybe it can be to give a gift for active users
 tobk: Wow, I just got about as much XP as going from zero to Legend in three games...
 macobo: A quest map? Where, what how? :D 
 eulerscheZahl: I can answer the where: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tnb1p7">https://prnt.sc/tnb1p7</a>
 macobo: Snarky&#160;:)
 macobo: Found it as well - didn't expect anything to be behind the codingame logo
 AmarjitSingh: heyyy
 Zenoscave: [CG]Thibaud what happens when you finish the new xp map
 tobk: Huh, why isn't the ranking-bar on the new home page logarithmic like in the chart you see when you click on it?
 [CG]Thibaud: for now, nothing Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: Later things to be added possibly?
 [CG]Thibaud: we'll add 2 new paths after those
 [CG]Thibaud: very hard ones
 Zenoscave: Great!

 eulerscheZahl: what does the author want to tell us here?
 inoryy: clash of code has the longest path :grimacing:
 tsq_code_game: .
 inoryy: but otherwise looks nice
 tsq_code_game: 还能聊天？
 jacek: ah inoryy i have an NN question for ya
 inoryy: shoot
 jacek: derivative of relu at 0. does it matter if its 1 or 0? sources say its arbitrary (i can choose either?) but for xor example the derivative must be 0 otherwise it wont converge, at least for me
 Hjax: huh this map thing got me 2 levels 
 Hjax: free xp
 darkhorse64: Is it really worth doing the CoC quest, XP Wise&#160;? Many steps and Coc is not my cup of tea
 Hjax: one of the coc quests is to complete a clash in 3 different languages 
 Hjax: which is where i am stuck, i always use python for clash
 jacek: i got all from clashes
 darkhorse64: I have done one clash in my life for the easy XP
 inoryy: jacek it doesn't matter in the sense that for continuous activations you'd almost never run into a strict zero
 jacek: xor example is just very small and i run into zeroes?
 inoryy: if you're trying to learn xor then maybe look at another activation that's differentiable everywhere
 inoryy: e.g. leaky relu, tanh, sigmoid, ...
 jacek: leaky relu is differentiable? :o
 inoryy: hmm I might be thinking of another one
 inoryy: there was one that emulates relu but doesn't have the non-differentiable spot
 jacek: well there was some smooth leaky-relu like
 inoryy: yeah
 LoGos: log(1+e^x)&#160;?
 LoGos: without parameters
 inoryy: I'm not sure what do you mean by "xor example is just very small and i run into zeroes?"
 jacek: that in more real world examples i would have thousands of units and i would never encounter exactly zero
 inoryy: but even in your case I'm not sure how you'd run into a strict zero? I guess if both inputs are 0 and it's the first first step after init with biases set to 0?
 inoryy: but then you can just init biases to something very small
 Zenoscave: darkhorse64 I would say it is only worthwhile if you time it&#160;;) There's sometimes lulls in CoC activity. Just compete when it's only the auto-bot players
 darkhorse64: I am awfully slow at these kind of things and I am a C++ only coder. It's not going to make it
 Zenoscave: darkhorse64 that's fair
 dbdr: aren't the bots behaving like real players?
 dbdr: reproducing the same solutions in the same time
 Zenoscave: inoryy can a derivative be approximated? do taylor polynomials make non-differential-able functions usuable in activation?
 Zenoscave: The last I played them they were very slow
 darkhorse64: They are not modeled after me
 Zenoscave: dbdr
 bipinsingh061: what up daher&#160;?&#160;:)
 MSmits: darkhorse64 you'll pick up python quickly
 MSmits: useful to know
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 MSmits: give it up eulerscheZahl, noone can fill the void mk left
 MSmits: it's a heroic try, but insufficient
 eulerscheZahl: i still haven't started working on an MK bot
 eulerscheZahl: hoping for the real one to return
 MSmits: fun project
 eulerscheZahl: and Cyberpunk
 MSmits: yeah that may be fun to create, but not fun for us when it is running :P
 MSmits: if you want someone to make chat walls, just ask me, no need to make a bot
 darkhorse64: I can read Python, speaking is another level
 MSmits: just do a bunch of easy puzzles
 MSmits: it's more fun in python too, because you need less code
 eulerscheZahl: i can make chat walls too. even below the actual chat
 eulerscheZahl: wanna see?
 darkhorse64: I have done the bare minimum of 15
 MSmits: nooo
 jacek: i wanna see chat wall
 jacek: 2 3 is best yavalath opening
 eulerscheZahl: \o/
 jacek: lets tart
 eulerscheZahl: muhaha ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 MSmits: 2 3 is very weak as player 1 tbh
 darkhorse64: what's a chat wall&#160;? It bounces questions&#160;?
 MSmits: evne though i start with it
 eulerscheZahl: do you know the answer now darkhorse64?
 jacek: i thought a chat wall was wall of text, not that thing
 eulerscheZahl: kudos to AutomatonNN for discovering it
 AutomatonNN: why do you plan to get the match to see what is the most promising than me?
 jacek: how could he discover it if noone wrote it?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 eulerscheZahl: bug?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, already over&#160;:(
 MSmits: emergent behavior
 darkhorse64: please do not make this chat look like #fr
 MSmits: what does #fr look like
 eulerscheZahl: 50% automaton chat activity?
 jacek: omelette du fromage
 eulerscheZahl: i hate that bot actually
 darkhorse64: and 50% useless rant
 bipinsingh061: #fr
 eulerscheZahl: now i want to know how that chat wall looks on dbdr's history
 dbdr: we checked before, didn't we?
 eulerscheZahl: did we?
 eulerscheZahl: i remember wiki syntax
 eulerscheZahl: {\displaystyle x={\frac {-b\pm {\sqrt {b^{2}-4ac}}}{2a}}\ \ }

 eulerscheZahl: the same as here
 dbdr: I have done 1 clash :D
 JBM: welcome to the wonderful world of... [lost inspiration here]
 dbdr: that's worth 2.5 CP apparently
 dbdr: for finishing 2nd :D
 eulerscheZahl: clickopolis
 dbdr: 2.5K CP
 eulerscheZahl: you have to explain that to me dbdr
 dbdr: same as being 1st in one optim
 dbdr: which part?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, CPi thought about XP from the quest map
 jacek: CP? :scream:
 JBM: don't get too addicted to clash cp
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tnedv6">https://prnt.sc/tnedv6</a>what is that progress bar good for?
 RoboStac: just think if you were 1st it'd be a full progress bar
 RoboStac: now theres a tiny bit missing to drive you mad
 dbdr: I guess some prople don't have a full bar&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: hmm, I should zoom in :D
 dbdr: 1/100th of a pixel&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: zoom stops at 500% for my browser

 eulerscheZahl: did you send your application already?
 dbdr: not yet
 eulerscheZahl: you can't compete on contests anymore if you work there

 AbundantPuddle: Oooh, did CG get an upgrade?
 AbundantPuddle: I feel like Euler has just done so many clashes he just knows all of the answers based off of 1 set of inputs and outputs.
 AntiSquid: for a moment i thought i entered some kinda RPG game from steam lol
 AntiSquid: when did the front page change?
 eulerscheZahl: 5h ago
 AntiSquid: and it feels like some kinda game, i click the buttons and collect XP rewards :D
 eulerscheZahl: you can get a full level with that. and i even miss parts of the clashing path
 Astrobytes: The clashing path makes me sad
 jacek: i got 2 levels
 eulerscheZahl: i fail the top10003 years ago i would have gotten it
 jacek: and i have full clashing path
 AntiSquid: it's funny because i got my clashing achivement through quick join + insta submit at 0%
 Astrobytes: I just got 1 level
 AntiSquid: oh i am stuck at win 3 reverse clashes, guess i need to do clashes now&#160;:/
 AbundantPuddle: Thanks AntiSquid. I just realized that I could click them.
 jacek: awesome UX isnt it
 Astrobytes: Whole thing seems a bit... clunky?
 AntiSquid: my gaming experience paid off AbundantPuddle
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tnfesv">https://prnt.sc/tnfesv</a>who can click faster?
 AntiSquid: i am not gonna click fast, gonna enjoy the slow clicks, reading description and savor the achievements
 AbundantPuddle: ^
 AntiSquid: otherwise could use a macro editor and just move mouse
 AntiSquid: oh i need to make a contribution damn
 eulerscheZahl: i'm far ahead of you
 AbundantPuddle: Me too, but I don't like contributing to anything.
 AntiSquid: so the community contest doesn't count eh?
 eulerscheZahl: this particular quest might motivate users to contribute nonsense, we'll see
 AbundantPuddle: Especially those programs for little kids.
 AbundantPuddle: Or abused animals.
 AntiSquid: it 100% does
 jacek: like yinsh?
 AntiSquid: or paper soccer
 eulerscheZahl: or an ASCII value clash
 AbundantPuddle: That is very true Euler. But wasn't there some sort of reward for contributions prior to this as well?
 AbundantPuddle: jacek with the low blow.
 Astrobytes: They're already pretty good at contributing nonsense eulerscheZahl! 
 eulerscheZahl: 250XP for an approved contribution, 10XP for an upvote
 eulerscheZahl: there's a new SDK puzzle pending
 Astrobytes: Perhaps a bonus system for clash easiness
 eulerscheZahl: with a mouse in a see
 eulerscheZahl: sea

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/home">https://www.codingame.com/home</a>
 el19oc: Oh damn
 eulerscheZahl: CG does A/B testing, maybe you don't have them yet
 el19oc: don't think I ever scrolled down on the homepage
 Astrobytes: No this is new today
 AntiSquid: next we need some gacha system and maybe some items / heroes / cards to play with :D
 Astrobytes: God no
 AntiSquid: the AI one is basically just get CSB legend on the path
 eulerscheZahl: easy path
 AntiSquid: anyone has clash path completed?
 AbundantPuddle: How about a challenge where we have to code bots to auto-progress through th quests?
 AbundantPuddle: *the
 Astrobytes: But that's just bot programming with leagues, which we have
 SPDene: just code an AI to replace yourself, and let THAT coe the bots :P
 AntiSquid: hm i thought i was level 49 before
 Astrobytes: Sure, ezpz&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: Or code an AI to write the AI that replaces you.
 jacek: or make code that would solve recaptcha
 Astrobytes: Or just give up and hide in the corner.
 eulerscheZahl: no AntiSquid. you are toad - 4
 AntiSquid: well now i need to do clashes seriously&#160;?&#160;:/automaton2000 help me
 Automaton2000: it's the easiest way to do that?
 Astrobytes: Hey, why is there no multiplayer in the filter on the contributions page. Only clashes and puzzles
 AntiSquid: would anyone be interested in 2v2 version of BotG&#160;? :p
 eulerscheZahl: because the filter is much older than SDK contributions
 Zenoscave: I have the clash path done AntiSquid
 eulerscheZahl: i could add a filter on my puzzle page :thinking:
 Astrobytes: They need to update that, it's annoying
 eulerscheZahl: have you ever tried opening the full page of approved puzzles?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid I'm barely interested in the original (no offense :D )
 AntiSquid: it's ok
 eulerscheZahl: 1k items on a single page, makes my browser cry in pain
 AntiSquid: so another 2v2 game then?
 Astrobytes: Just did eulerscheZahl, slowed the hell out of my browser
 Zenoscave: I handled it fine
 Astrobytes: I prefer your puzzle browser
 Zenoscave: Wait chat is now typing one letter a second
 Astrobytes: there you go
 eulerscheZahl: exactly :D
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave what are the challenges after the "win 3 reverse"&#160;? if you don't mind telling, want to know if i want to commit to clashes (kinda hate the rushed format, i like to take a nap inbetween and watch random videos)
 Zenoscave: Let me look on sec
 eulerscheZahl: 3 shortest
 Zenoscave: win 3 shortest, solve 3 in a row 
 Zenoscave: 3 different langs
 eulerscheZahl: 3 different language
 eulerscheZahl: top1000 leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: win 3 in a row
 Zenoscave: yup
 eulerscheZahl: i'm blocked on top1k
 jacek: but later there is win 3 games in a row&#160;:?
 RoboStac: top 1000 wouldn't take many clashes
 Zenoscave: currently 476th&#160;:/
 RoboStac: as long as you can win
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't want to clash anymore
 Zenoscave: It is like 5-10 wins to get top 1000
 eulerscheZahl: got the rest long ago
 AntiSquid: i am sure i was top 1000 just with the join - quit method
 AntiSquid: even top 200 at some point 
 eulerscheZahl: i was top10 at some point i think
 Zenoscave: Depends on the day, it's pretty volatile depending on some players
 eulerscheZahl: in my early CG days
 Zenoscave: My best was 2nd but I hadn't found the glory of multi's yet
 eulerscheZahl: CoC is rather prominent on the website
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, I'm on the 3 different languages, but I don't know how to change the site language to French or Spanish.
 AbundantPuddle: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: with a lobby that was on the main page till today
 Zenoscave: no 3 prog langs
 AntiSquid: should have a contest path there or something
 Zenoscave: r/whooosh to me
 eulerscheZahl: i did C# and python for sure. maybe py2 and py3?
 AbundantPuddle: I know Zeno, I was being funny.
 Zenoscave: just got it
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 AntiSquid: maybe even a language path
 AntiSquid: final challenge: code in some obscure language
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud said they will add 2 more paths
 Zenoscave: Like D?
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: in the drafts they had a "hacker path"
 AbundantPuddle: The Path of the D
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot the quests
 AntiSquid: D is super easy compared to other ones lol
 G-Rom: shhhhhttt
 dbdr: thibault said they would add some harder quests later
 eulerscheZahl: with a /secret command on the chat
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl giving away secrets
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 Zenoscave: is it the shrug command
 G-Rom: I'm still trying to find good enigma&#160;;) 
 jacek: double rot-13
 dbdr: quadruple is more secure
 jacek: ill make clash of it
 eulerscheZahl: find the next contest before it starts
 Zenoscave: G-Rom make a challeng to promote more than 1000 players at once on CSB
 dbdr: lol
 AntiSquid: G-Rom add a gacha system, i am only half joking, seriously you will boost the activity in no time with that
 Zenoscave: gacha?
 dbdr: gacha?
 Zenoscave: gacha?
 G-Rom: gacha?
 eulerscheZahl: call an API function that isn't available via UI
 eulerscheZahl: oh, combobreaker, sorry
 AntiSquid: not sure based on what or what you'd offer with it, but basically having more forms of points would go hand in hand with that funny path system
 Zenoscave: what is gacha
 AntiSquid: well gacha is basically having multiple forms of currencies in online games
 Zenoscave: ohhhhh
 G-Rom: berk
 eulerscheZahl: micro transactions?
 dbdr: CGcoin
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game</a>
 AntiSquid: but in case of CG it would be likes different types of point systems for different types of achivements or skills or whatever
 Zenoscave: lmgtfy.com/?q=gacha+game
 Astrobytes: No, no and no. Plus moar no. With no on top.
 dbdr: mine CGcoin in your bots
 G-Rom: no, we're preparing a lot of new exciting  stuff
 AntiSquid: lmgtfy gacha system  probably is better zenithude_web
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: interesting
 dbdr: gah, blocked on "play 50 clashes" :sweat_smile:
 AntiSquid: clash-coins :D
 eulerscheZahl: you should start to "play" them :D
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl how many do you have left?
 dbdr: automate you mean?
 AbundantPuddle: I think I broke it.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/CjXaK49">https://imgur.com/a/CjXaK49</a>
 eulerscheZahl: how many what?
 Zenoscave: achievements left to finish
 eulerscheZahl: i did 258 of 271
 eulerscheZahl: do the math yourself
 AntiSquid: he doesn't have the 1st in a contest yet
 Zenoscave: Of the new one. the paths
 eulerscheZahl: these are "quests".2 clash ones
 eulerscheZahl: top1k + win 3 in a row (which i probably have)
 Zenoscave: thanks for the correction&#160;:) What is in algorithms after puzzle of the week
 Zenoscave: that's what I'm stuck on right now. haven't done many puzzles lately
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/q4JruK.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/q4JruK.jpg</a>
 AbundantPuddle: I could have sworn I have done the puzzle of the week in the past. I guess not.
 Zenoscave: whoa dbdr
 dbdr: :innocent:
 AbundantPuddle: Way to be a db.
 AbundantPuddle: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: sure dbdr, you won a contest
 Zenoscave: Can you still get the Community contest achievement?
 eulerscheZahl: you can still create and suggest a community contest
 eulerscheZahl: it's just that CG won't help you in the creation process
 eulerscheZahl: where did my struct go? :sob:
 Zenoscave: I recall hearing about that
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/Cq24fH.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/Cq24fH.jpg</a>There, done with CG
 dbdr: what's next?
 Zenoscave: lol
 AntiSquid: buy the company
 dbdr: ah yes
 AntiSquid: and make a chain out of it 
 dbdr: CookinGame
 eulerscheZahl: your level isn't fully filled dbdr
 dbdr: yeah, but if I do it will overflow
 jacek: the good thing about dbd r is i could test multiple pass moves for the tree reuse
 jacek: dbdr do you have only patterns as eval?
 dbdr: no, also mobility
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes have an ugly filter that's an insult for every web designer <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=&amp;category=PUZZLE_SOLO">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=&amp;category=PUZZLE_SOLO</a>

 Astrobytes: haha nice one. It's functional, that satisfies a programmer
 AntiSquid: use padding, center top buttons 
 eulerscheZahl: "feel free to mail me, and I'll probably feel free to ignore you." :D
 itzblinkzy: pedrosorio share your code please?
 itzblinkzy: i'm tryna learn :pensive:
 itzblinkzy: :cry:
 jacek: huh
 pedrosorio: oh
 pedrosorio: @itzblinkzy can you link the clash so I can share?
 icecream17: Is the nullish coalescing operator available (js)?
 Astrobytes: Try it and see
 icecream17: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '?'at Answer.js. on line 47
 Adassko: you can use ||
 Astrobytes: have you seen struct yet eulerscheZahl?
 BenjaminUrquhart: struct is a social construct
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'll see myself out
 Zenoscave: more like a social con\1
 Zenoscave: because struct is a capturing group
 Zenoscave: I'll see myself out too
 Astrobytes: lol, gotta love a regular expression
 Astrobytes: (that was actually pretty decent)
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/1313/">https://xkcd.com/1313/</a>

 Astrobytes: Othello weights?
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: What happened to your Oware?
 jacek: essentially its the same but made unlucky submit
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 Astrobytes: robo still has a strong lead regardless
 MSmits: the NN's are all good. With so few games and RPS, it doesnt mean all that much
 Astrobytes: robo's did seem a bit stronger tbh, your benchmarks prove otherwise no doubt&#160;;)
 MSmits: I can make a bot that beats any single one, sometimes two. Haven't tried to fit against jacek yet, but pretty sure thats possible too. 
 MSmits: his current one wrecks me
 MSmits: Robo took a lot of time to win games against yeah, seemed harder than re curse
 MSmits: however, i got to some local minima where re curse was a lot harder to beat also
 RoboStac: have you tried at all against my current one?
 MSmits: nope
 Astrobytes: I think you'll find it stronger (just a hunch)
 MSmits: I am running a meta mcts, i hope that will help at some point, but no idea if it will ever do anything
 MSmits: yeah it might be stronger
 MSmits: but with this crazy rps, who knows
 MSmits: Robo did you try a CG bench against the other 3 NN's&#160;?
 MSmits: that would give good information I think
 MSmits: re curse beat your previous version
 RoboStac: yeah, it was doing much better than the submit actually did
 MSmits: 50+ against all 3?
 RoboStac: out of 100 games it'd lost 3
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: this was against all 3 NNs&#160;?
 RoboStac: yeah
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: looking at your last battles I would say jaceks earlier submit was lucky
 MSmits: and your bot seems much stronger
 Astrobytes: Don't say I didn't warn ya
 dbdr: RoboStac you went all in on clash :D
 RoboStac: needed to complete my quests!
 MSmits: btw Astrobytes, ST Nemesis is a crap movie, but picard is good
 Astrobytes: MSmits yes, you just need the story from Nemesis to get the background (they ruined that movie so hard)
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Picard series atones for it somewhat imo
 Astrobytes: But still a terrible way to end the TNG era
 MSmits: yeah

 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Wait what's this quest map thing?
 Astrobytes: Wait, what's with your username MCU
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I'm not mcu anymore :D
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I'm a new person
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I am now E
 Astrobytes: No, just MCU with lots of E
 jacek: fire at will <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhsPHV-40Nw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhsPHV-40Nw</a>
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: oh
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: okay
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Astrobytes: MCU, click on the quest icons
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: just finished 22 quests 
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: o.O
 Astrobytes: Lots of clashy ones no doubt
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: yeah
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I have to reach top 2% of bot programming...
 Astrobytes: gj, levelled up?
 MSmits: why top 2%?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: yeah, once
 MSmits: seems oddly specific?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: msmits it's a quest
 MSmits: really
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: yes
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: 7nth one down on the multis
 Astrobytes: You've seen the new quest map right MSmits?
 MSmits: nope
 Astrobytes: click back to home
 MSmits: whoa
 MSmits: nice map
 Astrobytes: Now click on shit until there's nothing else to click on
 MSmits: imma clickin
 MSmits: I'm AI passionate
 Zenoscave: I finished the puzzle of the week! I enjoyed this one
 Zenoscave: Cool just two quests left
 Astrobytes: Only had a brief look at it, some optimal path thingy?
 Zenoscave: Floyd warshall but a non-euclidean metric
 Astrobytes: Gotcha
 Zenoscave: there's a few aha's in it as well
 Astrobytes: Looked interesting but a bit wordy
 Zenoscave: The idea was given a graph with `m `points in a cartesian plane, and `s` freebie points. what is the largest distance between two points discountinting any edges from the `s` verties
 Zenoscave: the `s` verties aren't specified which ones are 'free'
 SandmanSW96: lol, I just wanna go on record and say, that bots golfing in clashes using python and ruby is a load of crap...
 Zenoscave: SandmanSW96 why
 Zenoscave: Nothing is stopping you from doing the same
 Astrobytes: yeah I saw you had to find the optimal placement of those
 SandmanSW96: I can see a human winning like that but using a longer winded language handicaps you against something that just spews the answer lol
 Astrobytes: The bots use human solutions
 SandmanSW96: still at least limit their golfing to javascript or something
 Zenoscave: They only print solutions that past contestants have given on the same problem
 Astrobytes: And the trick to golfing is using the right language for the job
 SandmanSW96: yeah but thats a bad reason to learn a whole new language
 Astrobytes: Same with all problems really. Right tool for the right job.
 Zenoscave: So if they can beat you so could any (hypothetically) player
 SandmanSW96: just to win a clash lol
 Zenoscave: It isn't so much a reason as an incentive&#160;;) think of it that way
 Astrobytes: Is there ever a bad reason to learn another language?
 SandmanSW96: then give that human who solved it the win lol
 Zenoscave: I'd be top 5 then
 Astrobytes: The bots are only in there when there aren't enough human competitors, don't sweat it
 Zenoscave: Most shortest sols are easy to find
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: o.O imagine clashing
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: imma invite euler :D
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: NOOOOOOO third place
 AntiSquid: that's a weird nickname
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: wdym weird =,=
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: u insulting my nickname?
 AntiSquid: why not have something generic that doesn't stand out?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: hmmm
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: idk
 AntiSquid: weird as in very unusual, uncommon
 Astrobytes: Like MostLongestE
 AntiSquid: strange, peculiar
 AntiSquid: odd
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: AntiSquid enough quoting the thesaurus 
 AntiSquid: 1 sec let me open up the thesaurus
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: oh lol you weren't
 AntiSquid: i havn't opened it yet
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: oh eerie, nice word, forgot about it
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: quaint
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: quirky
 Astrobytes: eerie isn't really applicable in this context tbh
 AntiSquid: don't really like some of the suggestions here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/weird">https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/weird</a>
 AntiSquid: i mean "magical" wtf?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: yeah you have a really eerie nickname
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: i think i missed another contest...
 Astrobytes: They're context dependent 
 AntiSquid: i think elusive should be on there
 Astrobytes: No
 AntiSquid: horrific is on there
 Astrobytes: Context again, though that stretches it a bit
 Astrobytes: But elusive? No way
 jacek: eerie? eeyup?
 Astrobytes: giddyup
 AntiSquid: well kinky is there too
 AntiSquid: i mean seriously, a lot of the words don't make sense as synonyms
 Astrobytes: They do in the appropriate context
 AntiSquid: and you can try other words to you get WEIRD suggestions
 AntiSquid: EEEEEEEEEEEEE&#160;: Antonyms for weird
 Astrobytes: Like if someone is into vanilla sex and someone is into kinky sex, the former may consider the latter as 'weird'
 AntiSquid: you should consider it a compliment then
 jacek: i prefer mint sex
 Astrobytes: i.e. 'outside of the norm'
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: o.O take it to pms lol
 jacek: pms eh?
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: not mine
 Astrobytes: No I wasn't being explicit, just explaining
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: XD
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: ik ik astro
 AntiSquid: dirty minds think alike
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE:&#160;;-;
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I feel like that was an insult
 AntiSquid: in what context? :p
 AntiSquid: it wasn't meant as one though
 Astrobytes:&#160;;-; &lt;= what is that anyway
 AntiSquid: some evolved form of UwU is my guess
 Insufficient: JBM's troll vs castles game is lit if any of you haven't tried it yet
 Astrobytes: Probably yeah
 Insufficient: the dots are the eyes and the dashes are the tears
 Insufficient: sad face&#160;;-;
 Astrobytes: That's really pushing it tbh
 AntiSquid: OpQ
 AntiSquid: it's a face with nose hair and monocle
 Astrobytes:&#160;??? Three question marks
 jacek: o&lt;-&lt;
 JBM: So lit 
 AntiSquid: 3 eyed guy with funny hair Astrobytes
 jacek:&#160;?: elvis operator
 Astrobytes: yep
 AntiSquid: why elvis?
 Astrobytes: The quiff
 Astrobytes: It's your hair one on it's side essentially
 Astrobytes: *its side
 AntiSquid: i'll call it the yakuza operator <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pinterest.fr/pin/161496336621740036/">https://www.pinterest.fr/pin/161496336621740036/</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: :horse:
 Astrobytes: Did you see the Japanese police are trying to prevent the Yakuza from handing out Halloween sweets this year?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: what's the background story? 
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: ummmmm what did I refresh to?
 AntiSquid: i've seen some news about china having their own digital currency though, quite interesting implications
 Astrobytes: Preventing a turf war in Kobe

 Astrobytes: Internal gang issues
 AntiSquid: i see Kobe yakuza are as tender as their beef
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: Halloween yakuza
 JBM: Like, there are other season's
 Astrobytes: Sounds like a puzzle name you might come up with JBM&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Replete with complicated descriptions and language to forcibly educate euler ofc
 Astrobytes: (I expect to see the above in the contributions section in the foreseeable :P )
 Astrobytes: Anyway, out for tonight. gn/bn all
 AntiSquid: gn
 AntiSquid: so difficult to find a reverse clash ...&#160;:/ 
 AntiSquid: 2 more to go
 JBM: I've got a few puzzles in my queue who already have a name but no content
 JBM: Or even topic, for some
 JBM: The Halloween Yakuza can wait
 AntiSquid: only getting fastest and shortest wtf
 starmaq: shortest challenges be like: ruby
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave loves clashes?
 Zenoscave: ruby&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: just trying to finish the clash path starmaq
 AntiSquid: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: i give up
 AntiSquid: where's reverse?
 Zenoscave: lol just did a reverse
 Zenoscave: two in a row
 Andy_F: im so lost with this reverse lol
 Zenoscave: It took a second to figure out for me too
 Zenoscave: It would have been easier if it was in numbers
 Zenoscave: Is there a good tron floodfill?

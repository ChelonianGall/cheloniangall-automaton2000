 RyanGilbert: how do i get mods to see my contrib
 eulerscheZahl: patience. there are &gt; 100 waiting for moderation at the moment
 eulerscheZahl: and it's not first come first serve. the interesting and simple ones will be moderated first
 eulerscheZahl: my contrib is waiting for 4 weeks already
 RyanGilbert: oke thanks
 Noo8: Hi guys! How long have you been coding?
 proogrmr: me beginner 
 RyanGilbert: how do you find your clash of code rank not general rank
 jrke: hover over clash page
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global</a>
 jrke: or goto - compete-&gt;leaderboard-&gt;clash
 RyanGilbert: thanks
 RyanGilbert: oh im not too bad lol
 RyanGilbert: how do you improve score?
 eulerscheZahl: win clashes
 RyanGilbert: aight
 eulerscheZahl: or try out the other leaderboards like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/bot_programming/global">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/bot_programming/global</a>
 eulerscheZahl: to climb there, you have to play those games: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 woody0907: how can I run the game?
 woody0907: all test cases has passed
 jacek: click submit
 woody0907: i got 100% after submit
 jacek: good. you solved the puzzle
 jacek: try other one or multiplayer game bot
 woody0907: I see 
 woody0907: thank you
 Shishir1: does the rank update in real time?
 jacek: once a day
 VizGhar: What data structure u used for memoization in RollerCoaster puzzle whensolving it with clojure? I've used hash-map, it works, but it's still slow
 VizGhar: because assoc function simply copies whole map
 eulerscheZahl: transient(vec (for [i (range groups) ] 0
 eulerscheZahl: is that my data structure?
 eulerscheZahl: i can't read that anymore
 VizGhar: :D not sure... vec is vector i believe, so probably yes
 eulerscheZahl: surely wasn't the easiest quest to complete
 VizGhar: And you have seen a lot
 eulerscheZahl: had some help from Zenoscave here on chat as my first approach was too slow as well
 VizGhar: I have to complete clojure achievement while I have vague idea how to use it
 eulerscheZahl: i missed that moment
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm at 0 again
 eulerscheZahl: so i have to create more contributions like 2048 where the default code gives you 100% correctness
 VizGhar: :grinning: I'll help don't worry
 eulerscheZahl: great
 VizGhar: thinking about this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://entanglement.gopherwoodstudios.com/en-US-index.html">http://entanglement.gopherwoodstudios.com/en-US-index.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can cheese your way to about 50% of the quest
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that looks cool
 VizGhar: great candidate for optim
 VizGhar: but u know... ainobody got time for this
 VizGhar: omg, I've solved 6 hard puzzles in 2 days and cannot solve that clojure thing... frustrating
 eulerscheZahl: no time, true...blockout is sitting there for 4 weeks already
 eulerscheZahl: contrib page is too cluttered
 Q12: agreed
 VizGhar: I'll check it next week most probably... how many times u can re-send puzzle?
 Q12: should be less CoC type contributions
 eulerscheZahl: until 3 users refuse it
 eulerscheZahl: space maze needed 4 attempts iirc
 mzbear: blockout seemed far too complicated to even try, tbh
 mzbear: also, i'm offended that blockout's rotation pivot is at the corner and not at the center&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, probably the problem for many. same reason as for space maze which was pending for ages
 mzbear: also, the pivot moves when you pan the model, which is annoying
 eulerscheZahl: three.js orbit controller
 eulerscheZahl: not my invention
 mzbear: well, it really needs a button to reset the camera, and the camera should be initially pointing towards center of the play area
 mzbear: it's way too easy to mess up the camera in a way that's impossible to recover from
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i'll see what I can do
 eulerscheZahl: first time that i'm working with that library
 mzbear: capping the minimum/maximum distance might make sense too, to make sure the camera is always in a sane state
 mzbear: the reset isn't really needed if you can't mess up the camera, after all
 vishal09: hii
 jacek: good morning
 zhoubou: Mornin'
 VizGhar: eulerscheZahl in that clojure thingy u used volatile/atoms a lot? Looks like keyword def for re-setting variable is slow too (allocating space in memory each time)
 VizGhar: I've used array for memoization and the solution is still slow o.O
 jacek: AutomatonNN do you use closure
 AutomatonNN: keep the one coming out of the contest
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what I did
 eulerscheZahl: solve on 9th of september 2017
 VizGhar: :D ok thanks... AutomatonNN you are talking to me? didn't wuite got you
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same as a fire?
 mzbear: AutomatonNN what's the meaning of life?
 AutomatonNN: why no same thing then?
 zhoubou: Do I get XP for Optimization path?
 jacek: you get XP for any quest
 zhoubou: I mean, aside from 25XP for the quest itself
 zhoubou: For example, scoring 40k points on Code vs zombies
 VizGhar: no XP, just rank&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Too bad. It will take me quite some time to reach lvl 20 then
 VizGhar: if you want to level up, solve some puzzles 50p for each one
 zhoubou: Yeah, I guess that is my best bet
 jacek: or reach legend in multiplayer games
 zhoubou: Lol I wish. I'm having difficulties with some easy puzzles, let alone reaching legend.
 eulerscheZahl: wood to legend is close to 1000XP, give it a chance
 zhoubou: Oh, that seems nice. What game do you suggest?
 eulerscheZahl: for easy points: coders strike back, tron
 eulerscheZahl: for fun while playing: something else
 zhoubou: I see. Thanks!
 XIlayPVPX: I just spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to compare the value of 2 strings
 XIlayPVPX: I'm such a Pepega
 VizGhar: I did it... forsaken clojure :D
 zhoubou: Congrats!
 VizGhar: note to myself - never use def with clojure
 VizGhar: tnx zhoubou
 mzbear: never say never
 zhoubou: You just said it twice :PWeird. Code completion doesn't work when bot programming, is that normal?
 VizGhar: do not count on CG IDE&#160;:
 zhoubou: Lol figures
 zhoubou: What happens if I delete the Boss :o
 VizGhar: you can replace him by any player in ladderboard
 zhoubou: Oh I see. Awesome
 Westicles: They should rename #fr the 24-hour westicles discussion channel
 Westicles: Really quite flattering&#160;:)
 XIlayPVPX: yo guys, so I'm doing the "Horse-racing Duals" puzzle, I for some reason made a for loop inside a for loop, and that reuslts in me failing the third stage in which the game throws 100k values at you to check if the code was efficient. Is there a more simple way to do it without 2 for loops?
 zhoubou: Look at the hint provided.
 zhoubou: You can do it with 1 loop
 jacek: 1 and log
 XIlayPVPX: kk
 zhoubou: Yeah, what jacek said
 Stilgart: XIlayPVPX: what you need to know is that an array can be sorted more efficiently than with a loop inside a loop
 XIlayPVPX: I'm right now just playing with it a bit after eating lunch
 Stilgart: your language provides an efficient sort function, which is the key to solve this not so easy puzzle
 jacek: puzzle is easy, with a twist
 XIlayPVPX: I think I figured it out one sec
 TopGameDeveloper: Hi
 XIlayPVPX: Solved it!!!!!
 XIlayPVPX: EYYYY
 XIlayPVPX: I had to sort the array and then solve for an abstract value of array[i]-array[i+1]
 jacek: :tada:
 Stilgart: jacek: guessing that one can sort an array more efficiently than quadratic time is far from easy
 Stilgart: gg XIlayPVPX
 jacek: just use language's sort
 Stilgart: why should I, when I do not know that my bubble sort is suboptimal
 Stilgart: (common beginner mistake)
 jacek: why even try to write own sorting :v
 Stilgart: because it is a good exercice for loop nests
 Westicles: We don't want the wrong sort around here
 Stilgart: (and people will say in the forum that I do not care about newomers&#160;:( )
 MSmits: are these newcomers who are women?
 MSmits: are they accusing you of sexism?
 MSmits: nasty 
 jacek: :drum:
 Stilgart: MSmith: should be, but does it matter&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea, I'm just randomly chiming in
 MSmits: jacek missed it, so i felt i had to
 jacek: oh, i really missed it
 MSmits: jacek, be a better troll plz
 jacek: im getting old
 MSmits: :P
 Stilgart: (now i feel like the only one missing it...&#160;:( )
 MSmits: you spelled newcomers wrong :P
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: "newomers"
 jacek: or did he?
 Stilgart: oops
 XIlayPVPX: :regional_indicator_e:
 jacek: stupid 2048. i cant get the learning to work at all o.O
 Stilgart: are you trying a NN for 2048&#160;?
 jacek: n-tuples
 Astrobytes: How many? There are a lot of possibilities no?
 jacek: i made this before for multiplayer games. but this time there is intermediate reward and the papers dont mention any activators like tanh
 jacek: for starters i used the one from the paper
 jacek: but it doesnt learn at all. must be bugged somewhat
 Westicles: I always meant to try the reverse solution for 2048.  The board is full in a certain way before you get the 131k tile, so run it backwards until it intersects your search.
 Westicles: One of the russians tried it but no luck apparently
 darkhorse64: I looked at the n-tuples thing for 2048 but a 4-tuple is 18**4 weights and I wonder if it really makes sense to use smaller tuples. So I just went back to beamsearch and snake pattern. I got 22M but when I get deeper, I score less. How many nodes do you explore in 50 ms&#160;?
 hiramutsu: hi I just tried this thing out with a friend. Does anyone know how to increase difficulty in private clash? Or do I have to be higher level?
 darkhorse64: clashes are randomly chosen, I believe
 ChampionCoder: yeah, that's correct
 hiramutsu: I tried playing about 5-6 private  clash with a friend but they seemed to be the simplest problems unlike the public one
 ChampionCoder: But I'm pretty sure that they make sure you have not created the clash
 eulerscheZahl:     const int searchDepth = 120;
 eulerscheZahl: that's enough for 54M points for me
 Westicles: darkhorse64, I just do a brute force 7 deep with offline search through the tough patches
 darkhorse64: There must be something wrong with my eval (a vanilla weighted sum) because the deeper I get, the larger my beam. My weights are increasing powers of 2 in a snake pattern
 ChampionCoder: Does anybody else find the "helpful" popups when we keep the cursor stationary over a line of code annoying?I feel we should keep those a little less verbose
 ChampionCoder: *MUCH less verbose
 eulerscheZahl: most of us use an offline IDE anyways
 ChampionCoder: oh
 eulerscheZahl: so i don't have an opinion on the popups
 ChampionCoder: I use th CodinGame one only
 ChampionCoder: *The
 eulerscheZahl: and I can code in multiple files
 eulerscheZahl: with a script to merge them
 ChampionCoder: :thumbs_up:
 jacek: sometimes its annoying, but i mostly copy paste from my IDE and do minor modification in CG IDE
 ChampionCoder: :thumbsup:
 ChampionCoder: Ok
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;: +1&#160;: for less typing
 ChampionCoder: Ah thanks :sweat_smile:
 darkhorse64: Except for puzzles, a powerful IDE is needed for bug hunting. However, CG editor is now really decent
 eulerscheZahl: for clash and easy puzzle it's totally fine, true
 eulerscheZahl: i might be biased as i mostly play multiplayers
 eulerscheZahl: the debugger is the killer argument for me
 darkhorse64: ^
 darkhorse64: "VS debugger"
 eulerscheZahl: no VS on linux&#160;:/
 darkhorse64: VS debugger is the killer argument for windows :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 eulerscheZahl: windows is the killer argument for windows sadly
 eulerscheZahl: i'm much faster switching window focus and arranging the windows on my screen with i3
 eulerscheZahl: and it's free
 eulerscheZahl: :money_with_wings:
 darkhorse64: i3&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4&amp;ab_channel=CodeCast">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4&amp;ab_channel=CodeCast</a>
 eulerscheZahl: minimalistic user interface
 darkhorse64: Nice. Yes, MS window manager is not that great. You too easily end up with lots of clutter. Anyway, I ru mainly Firefox (with dozens of open tabs) and VS
 darkhorse64: *run*
 eulerscheZahl: on windows i'm always lost with 5-6 open windows explorers
 eulerscheZahl: the default file browser on ubuntu supports tabs :P
 struct: doesnt window support tabs?
 jacek: then it would be called tabs not windows
 darkhorse64: Explorer user experience has not really changed since the first ever windows. You weren't born
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 MSmits: jacek has regained his focus
 Astrobytes: badoom-tss
 jacek: new moves in othello?
 MSmits: 3 new moves
 MSmits: thats all it takes with old john
 MSmits: he books all the way to the end, at least vs me, so it's just the same line of play
 MSmits: it's a dose of my own medicine really
 MSmits: he's just not relentless enough about it
 jacek: phew
 eulerscheZahl: well, there are extensions like clover: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clover.en.uptodown.com/windows">https://clover.en.uptodown.com/windows</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but i'm not sure if i want to explain the installation to my company in case someone finds out
 Astrobytes: just use linux at work, have a windows desktop image fullscreen in another workspace and switch to it when needed :P
 eulerscheZahl: i'm writing windows desktop applications and plugins for other windows software
 jacek: or use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://fakeupdate.net/">https://fakeupdate.net/</a> on fullscreen and do your business
 eulerscheZahl: classic, I know that site
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah, I know. It's a fun idea though.
 Westicles: I had all my personal code on work PC when they started tracking USB activity.  I get an email asking why I just offloaded 107k c++ files
 MSmits: 107k&#160;!!!
 MSmits: do you put every function in a new file or something?
 eulerscheZahl: tell them because you didn't want to type it again
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like your company is logging a lot
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure if it would be legal here
 Westicles: Hmm, well I guess some were txt files.  They had such nice backups running, I couldn't resist the free service
 MSmits: what did they say when you said it was personal files?
 eulerscheZahl: first of all: did he admit that?
 MSmits: true
 Westicles: Yeah, I said they were personal.  They just asked my boss if he was okay with it.  Sent him excel with all the file names, kind of embarrasing actually
 MSmits: you IT department is evil
 MSmits: your
 jacek: youd send them your files' names?
 jacek: shame on you
 Westicles: They were all like scrabble.cpp, scrabble1a.cpp, etc etc
 MSmits: mmh better than my file names
 MSmits: muahahahanr1, cpp
 MSmits: wouldnt want to explain that to the boss :P
 Astrobytes: wait til they saw your function names...
 MSmits: they are worse, I agree
 jacek: just use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projects.haykranen.nl/java/">https://projects.haykranen.nl/java/</a>
 Astrobytes: He doesn't even need that. His brain does it automatically :P
 MSmits: yup
 MSmits: this is why it is good cg bots are generally small
 MSmits: in a large project i would start to have huge function names
 MSmits: I dislike commenting
 jrke: MS D&amp;B leaderboard is getting tough and tough
 jacek: hm?
 jacek: it still 2 ppl then...... then the others
 jrke: my offline c++ compiler is mingw for c++ are pragmas syntax same as on CG
 jrke:&#160;?
 jacek: what are your pragmas
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66df91cd-6a27-4699-8dfe-390e86cb2d45">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/66df91cd-6a27-4699-8dfe-390e86cb2d45</a>

 jacek: oh euler already asleep
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps jacek around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: can't sleep, got System.IndexOutOfRangeException

 AutomatonNN: aktroached is the complete game you will need to be wrong
 jacek: sounds like nice game
 Kitkat260: hi
 IsaacSvi: howdy people
 Kitkat260: how are you
 IsaacSvi: doin good
 IsaacSvi: hbu?
 IsaacSvi: gonna start a clash rn
 Kitkat260: tired
 Kitkat260: but ok
 RyanGilbert: kinda scuffed
 RyanGilbert: wilfred0 25th place
 RyanGilbert: only played 5 games
 IsaacSvi: ok, n' back
 IsaacSvi: when i'm tired, it's either coffee, push ups, or sleep xD
 Kitkat260: hi
 IsaacSvi: hi again lol
 IsaacSvi: love this mix btw:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTN2YKLNDFc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTN2YKLNDFc</a>
 Kitkat260: nice
 Kitkat260: issac
 Kitkat260: anyone?!
 jacek: oO
 IsaacSvi: back lol
 IsaacSvi: ok, going back to another one xD
 jacek: is optim still bugged? i use 45ms and still get timeouts ocassionally
 Astrobytes: for 50ms limit?
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: People were going down to 30-35ms prior to the contest to avoid timeouts (at least in SR). Not sure if there's been an improvement tbh
 eulerscheZahl: while playing coders of the realm I didn't notice any unexpected timeouts
 Astrobytes: Optim though
 eulerscheZahl: can it be that different?
 eulerscheZahl: well, it's the CG website. so probably yes
 Astrobytes: Different servers aren't they?
 eulerscheZahl: optim has less different ones at least
 eulerscheZahl: (never analyzed anything myself)
 Astrobytes: been a while since I bothered looking tbh
 ZarthaxX: hey guys
 ZarthaxX: happy new year everyone in your countries :D
 eulerscheZahl: you are early, still 2020 here
 eulerscheZahl: but going to bed now, good night
 ZarthaxX: i know but it's hard to time
 ZarthaxX: bye bye toad :P
 Toby75: A question to the Challenge "Goro Want Chocolate": Why is the answer to Test Case 2 the number 10? I calculated it by hand, and I also came to 16. Does someone know why it is 10?
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxXoooooo
 Astrobytes: Toby75: I can't help you I'm afraid, I don't think I've solved that one
 ZarthaxX: astrobytopilopus
 Toby75: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/i1MkqtPN">https://pastebin.com/i1MkqtPN</a> can you have a look at this one? Why is it wrong?
 DJSchaffner: can someone tell me if this concept has a name in python: "("false", "true")[some function that returns true/false]"
 RyanGilbert: wdym
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxXman that must be the best one so far :D
 Astrobytes: Guys, don't ask me about puzzles right now. I'm drinking and merely moderating/chatting.
 RyanGilbert: do you mean like ["false","true"][&lt;boolean.]
 ZarthaxX: hehe :P
 TheAwardWinningSpongeInSpace_24c6: hi
 DJSchaffner: i dont know. someone used it in a clash and it looked like a nice way to do some things
 ZarthaxX: what time is it there astro
 DJSchaffner: ("false", "true")[calendar.isleap(year)]
 Astrobytes: just about 8pm Zartho
 TheAwardWinningSpongeInSpace_24c6: hiiiiiiiiiii
 Astrobytes: Hello
 ZarthaxX: i will say happy new year later i guess hehe
 ZarthaxX: wanted to say it to toad before he went bed
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I tend to say it on the day, for timezone reasons&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: :D
 Westicles: Hii TheAwardWinningSpongeInSpace_24c6
 jacek: oO
 ProgrammerDog: Happy New year!
 Astrobytes: steady on there brother, not yet
 ZarthaxX: ban for lying
 Astrobytes:  /ban everything
 Westicles: should we give e uler a new year's and approve blockout without actually solving?
 Westicles: *gift
 Astrobytes: No. 
 VizGhar: :D
 Astrobytes: How many approvals has he got on it?
 Westicles: Rockstar approved, then it disappeared.  So none
 laPetiteGrenouille: Hello&#160;! someone knows how put 1.2, 1 and not 1.0 in Python
 laPetiteGrenouille: happy new year =)
 laPetiteGrenouille: for example if i seach the mass of a grid&#160;;)&#160;;)
 Westicles: oh my!
 laPetiteGrenouille: yeah i didn't understand it ^^
 Astrobytes: without using strings laPetiteGrenouille
 BrainWart: "%g"%(1.0)
 laPetiteGrenouille: thxx
 laPetiteGrenouille: and why&#160;?
 laPetiteGrenouille: how search in internet&#160;?
 laPetiteGrenouille: wat*
 BrainWart: idk. googled it earlier. string format python no decimal or something like that
 laPetiteGrenouille: kk thx
 Astrobytes: but you said without str in #fr
 laPetiteGrenouille: yeah i wanted say like
 laPetiteGrenouille: a = str(1.0) and rstrip ".0"
 Westicles: I didn't think that center of mass puzzle would get approved, but the cranky physicists came out of the woodwork in favor
 laPetiteGrenouille: yes grrrrrrrrrrrrrr
 Westicles: Well, and also rockstar...
 laPetiteGrenouille: the top classment&#160;?
 laPetiteGrenouille: they can do all in 1 min and  without hand
 laPetiteGrenouille: fcking them
 laPetiteGrenouille: ^^
 GeorgeDzigo: HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!
 GeorgeDzigo: HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!
 GeorgeDzigo: HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!
 Astrobytes: eftychisméno to néo étos GeorgeDzigo, just a bit early for me
 JBM: just a bit
 Astrobytes: hey JBM, how's it going
 JBM: closer and closer to the end of a rather shit year
 JBM: you? ;p
 Astrobytes: Confirmed
 Astrobytes: Onwards and... onwards right?
 JBM: yeah that's the word
 ILoveEveryone: HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!
 Astrobytes: happy new years to you ILoveEveryone
 JBM: curfew+fireworks
 JBM: not sure how that's legal
 JBM: yet it's obviously happening
 Astrobytes: Haha, yeah gonna be the same here shortly
 Westicles: There are no laws now.  2021 the years the aliens land
 ILoveEveryone: XD
 Astrobytes: They already did according to that ex Israeli space agency guy
 Westicles: exactly
 ILoveEveryone: Well, after what we've seen in 2020, alien landing wouldn't be surprising.
 Astrobytes: I think he was just trying to sell his book but I'd love to be proved wrong
 Westicles: well, as long as it isn't the Blondie scenario.  And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
 Astrobytes: Frankly, I ain't bothered :D
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for tonight. Enjoy your celebrations if you're having any, if not then gn&#160;:)
 Westicles: gn
 Skynse: wow, it's 2021
 Skynse: This whole year was blank
 Stilgart: three contests is not enough&#160;:(
 Jrabovsky: if e[0].isnumeric():
 Jrabovsky: Would anyone know why divisor would give me the wrong value from a string?
 Jrabovsky: It works for one example but not with the other?
 Stilgart: python killed us all
 Stilgart: Jrabovsky: you should give more details
 Stilgart: what is "the correct value"&#160;? what is e[0]&#160;?
 Stilgart: why divisor while there is no division&#160;?
 Jrabovsky: the question was aN-b=c
 Jrabovsky: solve for N
 Jrabovsky: so I was trying to get 'a'
 Stilgart: what do you have in input&#160;?
 ifobg: because len(a)&gt;1

 Raghuveer: ok
 midoooo: how to avoid clashs with code size
 midoooo:&#160;??
 danabanana: isn't it fun? it kind of pushes you to make the least possible number of lines but still having correct answer
 LelouchVC2: It's terrible
 LelouchVC2: In the end you have a mess that would get you fired if you submitted anywhere
 LelouchVC2: Shortest mode gets you barely working code that probably relies on something it shouldnt
 Rikkuss: *$
 caubeloatchoat24: Mode game is ramdom right?

 Uljahn: Automaton2000: teach me how to code
 Automaton2000: how do you not have a lot of points
 danabanana: @evilpencilcase: you have to be careful of setting lowest temp. 0 &gt; negative numbers. also why did you have a hardcoded t &gt; -3? your code should be able to process any values
 KrasserTyp: hello guys
 KrasserTyp: hows it goin
 KrasserTyp: you in work?
 Ninii: heyyy
 KrasserTyp: hellloo
 KrasserTyp: u grill?
 AntiSquid: get your own grill, stop begging for others to share theirs KrasserTyp
 KrasserTyp: so u own this grill?
 Astrobytes: Is it a George Foreman?
 KrasserTyp: no weber
 Astrobytes: Ah I see
 Astrobytes: Gas or charcoal?
 KrasserTyp: good for cooking raw meat
 KrasserTyp: gas
 Astrobytes: Meh. Wanted charcoal. Oh well.
 tanmaycodernovice: lol
 KrasserTyp: hows your cat
 KrasserTyp: @astrobytes
 Ninii: :cat:
 Uljahn: :cat:
 KrasserTyp: :cat:
 Astrobytes: :smile_cat:
 KrasserTyp: soooohows your cat doing
 mlllll: :smile_cat:
 Astrobytes: Great, thanks.
 KrasserTyp: nice, good to hear
 KrasserTyp: pretty cute cat you got there
 jacek: :3
 Forres: guys what do u think about starting coding at 21 and studying electrical engineering  3rd class. Before this year i didnt know anything about coding and may i be programmer in 1.5 year if i study hard&#160;?
 JeanMax: you can be a programmer right now
 JeanMax: go!
 Uljahn: you mean studying electrical engineering and computer science at the same time or what?
 Forres: nope just studying electrical engineering but i wanna be a programmer
 Uljahn: why don't you quit EE and concentrate on programming then?
 Forres: because i always fnished it
 Forres: already"
 Uljahn: ah, i see
 Uljahn: then yes, study hard and become programmer, nothing wrong with it, im electrical engineer myself&#160;:)
 Uljahn: also programming for me is more like a hobby so i study in a relaxed way
 Forres: thanks a lot , also which programs does an electrical engineer need in  electrical and electronic workplaces
 Uljahn: it depends i guess, but matlab/simulink and labview are good to know
 Forres: Thank you so much!
 Scarfield: This site is great for programming in general, but if you want to learn languages for EE there are probably much better suited sites out there&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: from my own time as a student i would add pspice to the list
 sirsatan: is it similar to LTSpice&#160;?
 Hjax: im sorry Astrobytes ive failed you 
 Scarfield: there is still time, but you have succesfully joined the cat cluv
 Scarfield: club *
 Hjax: i have!
 Hjax: and hes wearing a bow tie 
 Scarfield: he sure is :D
 Scarfield: gotta look nice for a picture
 Scarfield: his curly ears kinda looks like horns :p
 Astrobytes: Oh hey Hjax, well maybe today then&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I'm loving his bow tie, handsome lil guy he is
 Hjax: black cats are so hard to take pictures of 
 Hjax: thats probably the best picture ill ever get of him 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, my other cat's black, kinda blends into most photos
 Hjax: i didnt quite finish my rust bot last night 
 Hjax: finally got into a fight with the borrow checker 
 Hjax: i resubmitted a few times to see if i could bring the boss down 
 Hjax: and i had the most unfortunate submit ever 
 Hjax: above 70% against the boss and snef
 struct: Boss strength increases per submit
 Hjax: 28-0 against bearded whale
 Hjax: and like, 20% against field 3 
 Astrobytes: lol, not good
 Astrobytes: Ah the Rust ownership stuff, kinda what stops me from learning it if I'm honest :D
 Hjax: i wonder what field 3 is doing
 Hjax: i consistently lose to him 
 Astrobytes: Not sure, his english is pretty bad so he doesn't talk too much
 Hjax: time to learn japanese
 eulerscheZahl: what languages do you speak beside english?
 eulerscheZahl: don't say python
 Hjax: please refer to my country for origin for the answer to that question
 Scarfield: hi AsthrelloBots
 Hjax: dumb american that only speaks english :D 
 eulerscheZahl: broken spanish?
 eulerscheZahl: i see :D
 Hjax: i took french in high school, i was terrible at it 
 Astrobytes: Hi Scarfumble
 eulerscheZahl: for European standards i'm horrible at languages too: only German and English
 Scarfield: whats your rollout count for othello?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and Latin, forgot parts of it again
 Astrobytes: My rollout count? I'm not using MCTS
 Hjax: bbl
 Scarfield: vir pudens non contra ventum mingit - wise man does not pee up against the wind
 Scarfield: oh i though you did MCTS
 Astrobytes: dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori
 Astrobytes: -,
 eulerscheZahl: it's sweet and&#160;? to die for your country
 Astrobytes: Nah, a/b here
 Astrobytes: fitting eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: I didn't take Latin but I know that from the Wilfred Owen poem
 eulerscheZahl: oh, decorum means the same as dulce
 eulerscheZahl: a Hendiadioyn
 eulerscheZahl: and of course i misspelled it: Hendiadyoin
 Scarfield: oh, now i know what you are talking about :p
 BaP: hello
 Scarfield: hi
 Astrobytes: Damn, I haven't heard that word since school
 BaP: i'm newbie
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not talking about my own patriotism obviously :D
 Scarfield: Ã¼ber Alles :p
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to take the basic class in Latin but there was none offered at my school
 eulerscheZahl: so i took the advanced class to avoid German and English in my final exams
 eulerscheZahl: I hate creative writing
 Astrobytes: They dropped everything except German and French at my school a year or so before I got there. Used to offer ancient/modern Greek, Latin, Spanish 
 Astrobytes: My uncle used to be fluent in ancient Greek, he was planning to be an archaeologist
 Astrobytes: Then at uni, his roommate turned out to be gay, so he quit, moved to London and joined the police :P
 eulerscheZahl: what a weird reason to quit university :D
 Astrobytes: He's massively homophobic and racist, that's why he joined the Met police :D
 eulerscheZahl: run or you get infected
 eulerscheZahl: but the racist joining the police makes me sad
 MisterStiff: fun fact, i got 96 in my college OOP class but i can barely do a codingame challenge
 Astrobytes: He's a nasty piece of work tbh, don't have many dealings with him thankfully
 MisterStiff: am i alone here?
 Astrobytes: Break out your problem solving skills&#160;;)
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/aNenM0A">https://9gag.com/gag/aNenM0A</a>
 eulerscheZahl: your OOP class is all about theory. get your hands dirty&#160;;)
 MisterStiff: nono, its all practice
 Astrobytes: Scarfield - on point!
 MisterStiff: we never really looked at theory, he just told us what he wanted and we had to get the end result
 Scarfield: to accurate sadly 
 Scarfield: too *
 Astrobytes: yup
 Astrobytes: Oh I got my MRI scan results today
 Astrobytes: I have multiple fractures in my spine
 Scarfield: :o
 MisterStiff: bruh what hapenned
 MisterStiff: happened*
 Astrobytes: It's usually caused by osteoporosis, but at 37 years of age I'm a bit young for that
 Astrobytes: So need to have blood tests, then a bone density scan
 eulerscheZahl: damn, doesn't sound good
 MisterStiff: yikes
 eulerscheZahl: at least you know the reason for the pain now
 Astrobytes: No, it certainly does not. But yeah euler, it's a relief to know there's something to work towards and it's not a complete mystery
 Astrobytes: In other news, I got a few thousand back in tax. Not all bad  :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: any plans with the money?
 Astrobytes: Nah, just save as much as I can. Doing less work currently due to the back issue so nice to have some extra on hand
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes since when do you have those fractures? D: sounds so sad
 Astrobytes: Well the pain started in February, but some fractures are older, and some are newer, so it's an ongoing thing
 Scarfield:&#160;:/ any idea how you have made those fractures?
 ZarthaxX: but those happened like passively?
 ZarthaxX: without doing excercise, just normal movement?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 Astrobytes: Could be any number of things, I won't speculate for now
 Astrobytes: Just wait for tests and scans to rule out or confirm a few things
 eulerscheZahl: what's the ETA for doing these tests?
 Astrobytes: Blood tests Thursday, should have results early next week. Bone density scan I'm not sure, gotta go to Glasgow for it, and there's a backlog because of the virus
 rak1507: You live in scotland?
 Astrobytes: I do indeed
 rak1507: Same
 Astrobytes: I'm Falkirk area
 rak1507: I'm in edinburgh
 Astrobytes: Nice to see a fellow Scot on here, don't see too many
 rak1507: yeah
 rak1507: Is there a way to golf n%4==1 in python by any chance?
 MisterStiff: how long have yall been coding? I just finished my 1st year of college in CS
 struct: n%4&gt;0
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Whut?
 rak1507: no
 rak1507: n%4 can be 2 or 3 as well
 struct: ah right
 struct: I dont think so then
 OiYouYeahYou: Is there a way to turn off the code hints?
 struct: grats Hjax
 Hjax: not guaranteed yet 
 Hjax: but this submit is crushing the boss
 struct: it is
 Hjax: and positive against field 3 
 Hjax: which is very important 
 struct: still mcts?
 Hjax: yes
 Hjax: i made my rollouts smarter 
 Hjax: slightly slower too 
 Hjax: but smarter 
 Astrobytes: oh looking good there man&#160;:+1:
 Hjax: im ready to lose every single game in wood 1 
 Hjax: maybe a tea pot will timeout vs me 
 darkhorse64: Sorry, I fixed my timeouts
 Hjax: darn 
 Hjax: now time for the massive losing streak! 
 Hjax: will i win a game
 darkhorse64: Against me sure
 Hjax: hey i won one! 
 Hjax: woooo
 Astrobytes: You'll defo win a few
 Hjax: my bot seems like its good against the other mcts bots 
 Hjax: and bad vs the minimax ones 
 Astrobytes: It can beat me sometimes
 struct: I wonder if someone will make mcts work here
 struct: I mean to  get to top
 MSmits: later struct, later&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: finishing off a meta mcts for oware, it's a lot of work, once thats  done I'll try othello
 Hjax: i cant wait to lose to you MSmits
 MSmits: everything that works with minimax should be at least workable with EPT mcts, if not necessarily better
 Astrobytes: That's my bet too
 struct: hmm this lose is strange dbdr
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/475243308">https://www.codingame.com/replay/475243308</a>
 Hjax: yeah that involves an evaluation function though 
 MSmits: yeah
 Hjax: which i havent bothered to write yet lol 
 MSmits: thats why i think it will probably work
 tomatoes: :laughing:
 MSmits: you need one here for sure
 Hjax: yeah ill get one eventually 
 Hjax: speed is more important to me right now 
 tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475243296">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475243296</a>
 tomatoes: something similar :thinking:
 Hjax: now i get to lose to the cool kids 
 struct: I guess if you are left with 1 piece so early
 struct: its insta loss
 struct: doesnt matter where you move
 struct: But is strange your bot said 0.14 after your move
 struct: and jace k was sure of loss
 MSmits: from what i read you need to  evaluate patterns on the boar
 MSmits: it's gonna be challenging to make that fast hjax
 Hjax: well i just want my mcts to be fast first 
 Hjax: before i worry about eval 
 MSmits: do you mean the sim mostly?
 MSmits: or are you worrying about backprop and uct and such?
 Hjax: everything, although i think i do spend most of my time in the body of my rollout function 
 Hjax: im only getting about 7k rollouts on move 2 right now 
 MSmits: well i wouldnt spend too much time optimizing randomly rolling out if you're going to end up using EPT
 Hjax: which doesnt seem very good 
 MSmits: random rollout is very game specific
 Hjax: my rollouts arent completely random anymore 
 MSmits: you dont learn that much from optimizing it I think, aside from some general bit tricks and such
 MSmits: ah ok
 ameybhavsar24: join clash <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1276129ad36c302c7c5b80fdc9640e31c5c35e9">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1276129ad36c302c7c5b80fdc9640e31c5c35e9</a>
 MSmits: pdep/pext is going to be necessary here for good eval
 MSmits: so you can check specific parts of the board
 Hjax: yeah java doesnt have pdep 
 MSmits: C# neither
 MSmits: i have a function that does it, but horribly slow
 MSmits: only use it for meta mcts in non-bottleneck situations
 Hjax: its also useful to mask off the nth move from my movegen while doing random rollouts 
 MSmits: right yeah that sort of thing
 MSmits: anyway, train arriving, ttyl!
 Hjax: ive been trying to port to rust, but im not used to rust yet
 Hjax: so im not quite done 
 Hjax: cya 
 MSmits: you're a bit rusty on rust
 Hjax: har har 
 struct: 16% win rate 
 struct: And its  still only 80 matches played&#160;:(
 struct: even with 10 players
 Hjax: in wood 2 i was pushing 90% winrates 
 Hjax: now i just get owned 
 darkhorse64: Don't swim with sharks when you are a small fish
 darkhorse64: btw, I am still dead last
 Hjax:&#160;:(
 Hjax: i am very close to being dead last 
 Hjax: ill try EPT tonight 
 Hjax: although i want to solve my rust issues 
 Astrobytes: In this league we measure success in terms of points above darkhorse64 :P
 darkhorse64: :grinning:
 Hjax: im hoping dbdr will show up today so i bug him about rust things 
 Hjax: so i can*
 Hjax: my win against you is funny Astrobytes
 Hjax: your eval gets pretty high and then suddenly tanks 
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's all over when you grab top lefft corner lol
 Hjax: so when you do EPT, you do like, a 5 move rollout and then eval at the end right? 
 tomatoes: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Hjax: is that better than just doing the hybrid mcts where you replace the rollout with a low depth minimax search?
 Hjax: the minimax search seems like it would be strictly better 
 Hjax: i guess its probably a bit slower
 tomatoes: top 5 all have minimax i think
 Hjax: yeah but they arent doing UCT are they? 
 Hjax: i thought they were all doing normal a/b things 
 Astrobytes: I guess what you might lose in speed with the MCTS/mm hybrid you gain in accuracy
 Astrobytes: Never actually tried it
 Hjax: the papers i see on EPT MCTS are saying that the eval function doesnt have to be particularly good to be a huge improvement over full random playouts 
 Astrobytes: In terms of top 5, dbd r is using ProbCut, others just TTs and books afaik
 struct: still no NN&#160;:(
 Hjax: which is interesting 
 Hjax: probcut is some like, fancy linear regression thing right? to estimate the higher depth searches with the lower depth results 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, pretty cool
 Hjax: is it just used for move ordering? 
 Hjax: moves that the equation says will be good on this iteration go first? 
 Astrobytes: More about pruning afaik
 Astrobytes: I mean so's move ordering but you know what I mean
 struct: Multi-Prob cut is mentioned in the wiki of othello
 Hjax: oh you actually use it to compute alpha and beta 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, iterative deepening on the lower depth searches and different stats and params for different stages
 Hjax: thats very fancy
 Astrobytes: ( referring to multi prob cut)
 Astrobytes: Yes, and it's highly effective apparently
 Hjax: i follow computer chess a bit, theres so many techniques 
 Hjax: stockfish is an incredible piece of software engineering, its so fine tuned 
 Astrobytes: One could easily get lost down that rabbit hole, it's crazy. In a good way
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you're not wrong there
 joshihsoj: hello nitekat
 joshihsoj: nitekat
 jacek: sometimes better eval is worse in mcts
 jacek: at least that was the case with my bot in oware
 jacek: or, more likely, the better eval was 'tuned' for minimax than mcts
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I had to tune my eval slightly differently when I switched to the MCTS in oware
 dbdr: Hijax, I'm here
 Hjax: hi there 
 Hjax: so the thing i got stuck on is really stupid 
 Hjax: i have vector of Nodes, and i want my function to return the one with the max uct value 
 dbdr: (thanks struct, that does look like a bug)
 Hjax: but rust doesnt know that theres anything in my vector of nodes 
 Hjax: and theres no null type obviously
 Hjax: so i feel like i have to use optional 
 dbdr: wouldn't a visit count solve this as well?
 Hjax: but when i use optional, the borrow checker blew up saying that the method can only return an immutable reference 
 dbdr: I don't think Option would be a problem, but I also don't think it's needed
 Hjax: how would i do it without option?
 dbdr: plain nodes, with a visit count
 Hjax: i have a vector of nodes, each of them has a visit count 
 Hjax: im trying to select the one that maximizes uct
 Hjax: i dont think i follow what youre saying 
 dbdr: me neither :D
 dbdr: first, do you have one big array/vec, or one for each set of sibblings?
 Hjax: each node has a vec of children 
 dbdr: ok, that's slower I think, but it can work
 Hjax: whats the faster way? 
 dbdr: one array
 Hjax: one array containing every node?
 dbdr: yes
 Hjax: how do you know where your children are? 
 dbdr: indexes
 Astrobytes: Index + child count
 Astrobytes: same in C++
 Hjax: so each node stores the index of its first child
 Hjax: and offsets?
 dbdr: you cab keep them contiguous
 dbdr: can
 Hjax: can i? those children have children
 dbdr: there are several ways to do it of course
 dbdr: sure, they have the index of their first child
 dbdr: which can be a special value if they are not expanded yet
 Hjax: oh i thought you were saying there was a way to do it without keeping the index of your first child 
 Hjax: which i found confusing 
 dbdr: no, both Astrobytes and me mentioned indexes&#160;:)
 Hjax: i wonder how big of a speedup this is 
 dbdr: by contiguous, I mean the children between themselves
 Hjax: ah yeah
 Hjax: well thats useful to know, i didnt consider doing it that way 
 Astrobytes: This is what we were meaning wrt a node pool before
 Hjax: i wrote my search without giving it a ton of thought 
 Hjax: when i tried to add a node pool, i just preallocated an array of nodes, and replaced all "new Node()"s with NODE_POOL[index++]
 Hjax: which didnt work very well 
 dbdr: in Java?
 Hjax: yes lol 
 Hjax: ok so assuming i fix that, im not sure that i know how to write a selection method without a null type 
 dbdr: Java is different, because you can't have an array of nodes
 dbdr: only an array of references to nodes
 Hjax: yes thats true 
 Astrobytes: Ohhh yes indeed
 dbdr: loop over your children, find the max, return its index
 Hjax: oh 
 Hjax: ok it just clicked 
 Hjax: i get it now 
 Hjax: i should never be passing around Nodes, just ints 
 dbdr: yes
 jacek: or moves
 dbdr: this is part of what is new when coming from GC languages
 dbdr: you have more control
 jacek: and more ways to screw up
 Hjax: yeah, definitely a learning curve 
 dbdr: not in rust&#160;:)
 Hjax: too used to java and python holding my hand 
 dbdr: the compiler is your friend
 Hjax: the compiler telling you why you screwed up is definitely preferable to having to ask valgrind why you screwed up 
 Astrobytes: :D
 Hjax: although valgrind is a great tool 
 Hjax: not needing it is better
 dbdr: it also only finds validations that do happen while it is running, right?
 dbdr: not those that might happen in certain case but you don't have a test for it yet
 Hjax: yes, it tells you about memory leaks, and can tell you what went wrong when the program crashes 
 Hjax: but you have to be able to cause the crash first
 dbdr: so your first failure is in production
 Hjax: yeah, i like the design principles of rust 
 Hjax: i just need to learn it 
 Hjax: my move gen / make / rollout functions all work fine 
 Hjax: just need to do the search 
 Hjax: but i was apparently trying to write it too java
 Hjax: java-esque* 
 Hjax: which is why i got stuck 
 dbdr: that's normal
 dbdr: it's not the easiest thing to start with a MCTS&#160;;)
 Hjax: i watched my java bot run in visualvm 
 Hjax: it consumes memory very quickly 
 Hjax: so do you combine your bitboard class and mcts node class into a single class? 
 Hjax: right now my node has a bitboard instance 
 Hjax: othello bitboards are pretty tiny, two u64s and a boolean 
 dbdr: I'm not using MCTS in othello
 Hjax: right, but in general would you combine them? if you were doing mcts?
 jacek: you mean to hold game state in node instead of move?
 tomatoes: both ways are viable. or store state, or make moves during selection
 darkhorse64: Irt's a tradeoff, less nodes in your pool but faster selection (which consumes nodes faster)
 Hjax: yeah i hold a game state rather than a move in my node 
 Astrobytes: Yeah there's no real right or wrong way, game/situation/implementation dependent
 Hjax: a move is only half the size of a board 
 Hjax: i guess a move can be a byte if i want it to be really small 
 darkhorse64: If you are fast enough, you can consume nodes faster than you reuse them. Strange things happens then
 Hjax: 1 &lt;&lt; move
 Astrobytes: Welcome to the world of Really Fun Bugs.
 Hjax: oh boy 
 darkhorse64: I had that problem in Bandas
 Hjax: i was thinking the node pool thing makes tree reuse really hard 
 Hjax: because its hard to know what nodes are safe to reuse 
 Hjax: and which ones got moved into your new tree 
 darkhorse64: It makes it free and easy
 Hjax: what? how
 Hjax: unless your pool is big enough that you never need to reuse nodes for the entire game 
 Hjax: then yes its free and easy 
 darkhorse64: set your mcts root to the last node played. when your index grows too large, reset it to zero
 tomatoes: this is where smaller node size coming in
 Hjax: yes, but how do you guarantee the index doesnt overrun a node thats still in the tree? 
 struct: Hjax a move is not half the size
 Hjax: in the next search 
 Hjax: i corrected that a move can be a byte with a bitshift struct 
 Hjax: a naive move is half the size 
 Astrobytes: And reset the parent of your new root
 struct: ah I se
 Hjax: i dont see how you dont have some live nodes at the beginning of your array 
 jacek: wtf happened here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475243296">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/475243296</a>
 Hjax: that ruin your day when you reset the index 
 tomatoes: owned
 struct: yeah jacek, dbd r has similar replay vs tomatoes
 Astrobytes: Serious pwnage
 jacek: i remember in very beginning i had similar thing against trict when he was top and i was bottom
 darkhorse64: Hjax: you cannot guarantee that if you consume nodes faster than you free them. In practice, it works not too bad 
 Astrobytes: If your node array is big enough, and you're reusing the tree then you should be fine Hjax
 Hjax: are you just gambling that you dont run over an important node 
 Astrobytes: *should*
 Hjax: seems spooky 
 Astrobytes: You'll know if you do
 Hjax: lol 
 Hjax: if the mcts got lucky, it could have built the line that was ended up being played very early on
 Hjax: and then your root is early in the array 
 Hjax: and you run it over 
 Hjax: and explode 
 Hjax: so the idea is that if your pool is big enough, thats very unlikely? 
 darkhorse64: If you think hard enough, you will realize that all nodes allocated before your root node will never be accessed and that they are before your root node in the pool
 Hjax: yes, but theres also nodes after my root node that are off the tree too 
 tomatoes: only push new nodes, no overwrite
 darkhorse64: they are after in the pool
 Hjax: yes, if theres too many dead nodes after my root 
 Hjax: i blow up and die 
 tomatoes: no, i had ~1.5m nodes in the end
 darkhorse64: The next move will get you back many of these dead nodes
 Hjax: yes, but what if i need those nodes right now 
 Hjax: my pool was too small then? 
 Hjax: gtg
 Hjax: be back in a bit
 darkhorse64: You cannot. Time for pencil and paper.
 jacek: and soccer
 darkhorse64: :wink:
 Astrobytes: Always advertising
 Astrobytes: I can't stand the word 'soccer'
 darkhorse64: Did I say something goofy&#160;?
 struct: Hjax unless you do like me and expand every rollout I dont think you will have problems
 Astrobytes: No darkhorse64, you just reminded jacek to advertise his Paper Soccer multi
 jacek: now youre advertising it
 AbundantPuddle: Paper Football?
 Astrobytes: I always prefer 'football' over 'soccer' because you kick the ball with your feet.
 AbundantPuddle: In America, we throw footballs with our hands.
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, I know
 AbundantPuddle: :joy:
 Astrobytes: We do it too, but different. Rugby.
 AbundantPuddle: We have rugby here as well. Just not as prevalent as football.
 Astrobytes: I used to follow American football wayyyy back when I was a kid. I was a Bears fan for some reason.
 Astrobytes: Used to have to stay up real late, or get up real early to watch it though.
 Hjax: ok i wasnt gone for as long as i thought i would be 
 Hjax: i didnt consider that people in other countries would pay attention to american football 
 AbundantPuddle: Lol. I never got the whole sports fanatics thing. Like sports are okay to watch to pass the time I guess, but people go crazy. Watching sports makes me feel lazy. I'd rather be playing them. But American football is an insanely profitable business.
 Astrobytes: Rugby's great though. London's a nice place to watch international rugby, all the French, English, Scots, Kiwis etc all together in one pub. Great atmosphere
 Astrobytes: No I don't follow sports any more, other than watching some rugby a few times a year
 AbundantPuddle: That's cool. That's something I can get behind, bringing people of different cultures together under a similar passion.
 Astrobytes: 'soccer' is the same, just businesses to float on the market
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's much a much friendlier atmosphere than watching football/soccer with rival supporters in the building
 AbundantPuddle: Everybody else in the world should just change their football terminology to soccer. And instead of American Football, you can just call it football.
 AbundantPuddle: :joy:
 Astrobytes: lol, shuddup :P
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, I don't know why we have to be difficult and different. I completely agree. It's weird we named the sport where you kick the ball soccer, and named the sport where you throw the ball football, especially when the rest of the world already had football, and it was our soccer.
 AbundantPuddle: We just like to piss off the rest of the world I guess. We're pretty good at it.
 Astrobytes: It's a very American thing to do I guess (in the general case) :shrug:
 Astrobytes: 'American'
 AbundantPuddle: Murica!
 Astrobytes: The English do the same sort of thing, the superiority complex
 AbundantPuddle: I guess it's good we're not the only ones. England and us can share the hate then.
 Hjax: the americans and brits are in a contest to see who can have the most bizarre political landscape 
 Astrobytes: You know it
 Hjax: its quite the show of one-upmanship
 AbundantPuddle: I think our current country leaders can attest to that.
 Astrobytes: You guys really had it for a while but we caught up pretty swiftly
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 AbundantPuddle: I don't know much about U.K. politics, but whenever I found out about Boris Johnson, he really seemed like the UK equivalent of Trump. 
 Hjax: i just dont understand why he cant comb his hair 
 AbundantPuddle: Although not as discriminatory.
 Astrobytes: Well, they share some traits, but Johnson is nowhere near as thick. He's relatively smart.
 AbundantPuddle: He really does strike me as a "special" person. Especially when he wears his helmet.
 Astrobytes: Oh, that.
 AbundantPuddle: I believe it for sure. Trump is a complete moron.
 Astrobytes: An idiot up front is just what you need to get stuff done behind the scenes right
 eulerscheZahl: he just got bored from winning that much, as he announced on his previous election rally
 AbundantPuddle: I do think he is more hated than he deserves, however. I think a lot of people hate him for the wrong reasons because the politics in this country are so messed up right now, but he is an idiot for sure.
 Astrobytes: afk, bbs
 AbundantPuddle: But yeah, sorry about discussing politics. The world is a craphole and we're all going to die someday. Lol.
 Hjax: its nice to have so many smart people here to talk to btw, i really appreciate the advice&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: By the way, I think the server compilation is broken. It's not running my code correctly.
 AbundantPuddle: :joy:
 Hjax: struct you here
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, the user base on this site is top-notch.
 struct: yea
 Hjax: what does the default ai do 
 Hjax: random legal moves?
 Astrobytes: back, sorry, medicine break
 struct: its the same as wood 2 bosss
 struct: I think
 Astrobytes: Isn't the default AI the last boss?
 Hjax: oh is it 
 Hjax: i didnt know that 
 AbundantPuddle: Sure. "Medicine"
 Astrobytes: No it was medicine.
 Hjax: i just lost to it, and i was like, please dont be random 
 Hjax: please be skilled 
 Astrobytes: lol
 AbundantPuddle: Aw, that's no fun.
 Hjax: well im glad its the boss lol
 Astrobytes: Hey you don't wanna test against a dumb AI right
 AbundantPuddle: Well that depends on what the stakes are.
 struct: When I want to test vs dumb AI I test vs myself
 AbundantPuddle: If it were world domination, I would definitely prefer a dumb AI.
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: yeah fair
 Astrobytes: We test vs darkhorse64 struct :P
 AbundantPuddle: Is that considered cyber-bullying?
 AbundantPuddle: :joy:
 Astrobytes: As soon as he fixes his bot, I know he's gonna make sure he destroys me :D
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 ProfessionalScrewUp: Hey..uhhh...anyone know if there's a bot uprising going on?
 Hjax: how so ProfessionalScrewUp
 ProfessionalScrewUp: I swear there are more bots in CoC...
 ProfessionalScrewUp: ..or maybe I'm just that bad
 Astrobytes: The number varies depending on the number of available human participants
 ProfessionalScrewUp: Hmmm
 Astrobytes: But there aren't any extra ones overall no
 Hjax: yeah if theres enough humans in the lobby, the bots clear out 
 ProfessionalScrewUp: Ahhhh
 Astrobytes: Dammit, I might change my variable to 'pices' over 'pieces' since I type it so damn often
 jacek: does that piece you off?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Not bad jacek, not bad
 Hjax: so does anyone have a plan to dethrone dbdr 
 Hjax: or is he just the kind of othello now 
 Hjax: king* 
 jacek: because i let him
 Astrobytes: I think jacek has ideas. Smits is gonna come along soon with something. And I have a feeling tric is gonna come back with a bang
 Hjax: ah so kind
 Hjax: smits is always scary 
 jacek: poor foxy though, his 90s algo got rekt
 Astrobytes: He updated it a bit tho
 Astrobytes: So not pure 90s algo
 jacek: no wonder. some advancements in ai happened since 90s
 jacek: ;v
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: he just had an old othello implementation sitting around and uploaded it?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was his first ever big C project or something along those lines
 Astrobytes: *game-playing project
 Astrobytes: Early 90s
 Hjax: early 90s? its older than me 
 Astrobytes: Wrecked everyone initially
 struct: its from 1990
 Hjax: 6 years older than me 
 Astrobytes: There ya go
 Astrobytes: I was 8 and still mucking about with my Atari 1040
 Hjax: wow a whopping 1mb of ram 
 Astrobytes: My Amiga 1200 a couple years later had 2. So there :P
 Hjax: im spoiled by modern computers 
 Hjax: my parents desktop computer growing up had 256 mb, my first laptop had 8 gb 
 Hjax: i actually learned python on a jailbroken ipod touch, because i didnt have a laptop yet 
 Astrobytes: Nice. Well, you use what you gotta use right
 Astrobytes: We had a 486, then a Pentium, donno how much RAM, I was still very attached to my Amiga (got the 8mb RAM upgrade eventually)
 jacek: how many mcts nodes would you fit there
 Astrobytes: Not many. But it still amazes me how much performance they managed to squeeze out of limited hardware from back in the day. And still do in embedded sector. People should pay more attention to resource usage
 Hjax: or you can bury your hardware under 14 layers of abstraction and complain about how slow it is 
 Astrobytes: Quite!
 Hjax: ill learn to write performant things sooner or later, othello is a good first step 
 Hjax: i dont think my performance is /terrible/ but it could be a lot better
 360hazzy: hey guys
 Hjax: hello
 Astrobytes: Dude, you implemented your MCTS, got it up and running, got it faster, got it smarter - take your time
 Astrobytes: Hi
 struct: I dont want to see java bot on top league
 struct: Submit the rust bot
 Astrobytes: lmao, you have Been Told.
 struct: either that or new boss&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: time to get rank 1 with rust 
 Hjax: er
 Hjax: java* 
 Hjax: to make struct mad
 Astrobytes: Top league consisting of dbdr
 Hjax: i did want to get wood 1 with java before switching at least 
 Hjax: to prove i could 
 Hjax: so im glad i succeeded 
 Astrobytes: Yup, and wasn't a bad submit all things considered
 Hjax: i messed up the wood 2 rankings with my constant submitting lol
 Astrobytes: Meh. It's up to everyone else to fix their rank now eh
 Hjax: i dropped snef below coffee cup and field 3 
 Astrobytes: Oof. Even a resubmit would put him back up tho.
 Astrobytes: Probably
 Hjax: over the last day or two, the boss lost like 3 points, and coffee and field gained like 3 points 
 Astrobytes: Boss was pushed pretty high even before you started submitting right?
 Astrobytes: Like 35+ points iirc
 Hjax: yeah 
 Hjax: side effect of small leagues i guess 
 Hjax: not a lot of people promoting, so the boss gains points
 Astrobytes: Same in underactive multis
 Hjax: i had to drag it down a lot

 tomatoes: list comprehensions
 Uljahn: is it for code golf or what kind of "optimizing"?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i optimized for speed
 eulerscheZahl: def x(n,m): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/59216db8-5902-4057-b434-35b762a3540d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/59216db8-5902-4057-b434-35b762a3540d</a>
 OndrejBakan: I mean for code length.
 eulerscheZahl: s =, not s -= ...
 tomatoes: sum(i for i in range(n) if not all([i&#160;% 3, i&#160;% 5, i&#160;% 7])) :thinking:
 OndrejBakan: print(sum([i for i in range(n) if i&#160;% 3 == 0 or i&#160;% 5 == 0 or i&#160;% 7 == 0]))
 OndrejBakan: Oh, I see. :D Thank you. I am just a script kiddie (as you can see), but I love CodinGame. :D
 eulerscheZahl: sum(i for i in range(n) if not (i%3)*(i%5)*(i%7))
 eulerscheZahl: ==0 would be even shorter than "not"
 eulerscheZahl: sum(i for i in range(n)if(i%3)*(i%5)*(i%7)==0)
 tomatoes: &lt;1
 eulerscheZahl: right
 eulerscheZahl: did we win the clash?
 Uljahn: :trophy:
 struct: ruby would beat it sorry&#160;:(
 Hjax: ever see the code golf page on stackoverflow 
 Hjax: people will get like, 5 byte solutions using these weird golfing languages 
 Astrobytes: It's a strange hobby to me those golfing langs but whatever floats their boats I guess
 Hjax: agreed 
 OndrejBakan: euler, we didn't I already submitted my code before asking :D 
 Astrobytes: Did they win the post-clash clash then?
 struct: p`tail -1`.split.inject(0){|s,i|(i=i.to_i)%3&amp;i%5&amp;i%7&lt;1?s+i:s}
 struct: my best try
 Astrobytes: trictrac do you have anything incoming for Othello?
 trictrac: not yet I am working on eval
 Astrobytes: Have you considered ProbCut/MultiProbCut?
 trictrac: I have a kind of probcut but not sure that's the "real" one
 Astrobytes: dbd r is using it quite effectively, not sure if regular probcut or multi though
 Astrobytes: Interesting technique, I hadn't come across it before
 trictrac: I will have a detailled look, thank you
 Astrobytes: You're welcome (I think?!&#160;;) )
 Hjax: oh no, youre making him stronger :P
 Astrobytes: All about tough competition&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: The tougher the opposition, the more you can improve
 Astrobytes: I have a lot of improving to do :grin:
 Hjax: usually the opposition is the guy in the mirror who is trying to figure out rusts borrow checker 
 Hjax: do you do any local testing?
 Astrobytes: I thought you'd sorted this part out?
 Astrobytes: Not currently, but I'm planning to
 Hjax: well, ive sorted out my first fight with the borrow checker 
 Hjax: there will be more 
 Hjax: ive been meaning to see how to compile a ref for brutaltester 
 Hjax: i think you just insert some main class into the ref and build it 
 Astrobytes: Been a while since I used it, there's a line or two needs changing or something if it's not already compatible, can't remember fully
 Hjax: the problem with search games is testing is super slow 
 Astrobytes: The main class for the ref is just to run locally no? Not for brutaltester
 Astrobytes: As in run a game
 Hjax: i think brutaltester supplies a main class that you need to insert into the ref 
 Hjax: to get it to talk to brutaltester
 Astrobytes: Can't remember tbh, don't mind me
 Astrobytes: lo
 Astrobytes: l
 Astrobytes: Think there's some info in the forums regarding this
 Astrobytes: Not sure if the doc has been updated on github with the required changes or not
 Hjax: the github doc talks about inserting a CommandLineInterface class into the ref 
 Hjax: not sure if thats accurate 
 tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/pull/3/commits/cd6fb6977f24d7eb067f0db6a1b4bf6da9500887">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/pull/3/commits/cd6fb6977f24d7eb067f0db6a1b4bf6da9500887</a>
 Hjax: yeah that looks like what the brutaltester repo was saying 
 Astrobytes: Yep, seems to still be the case
 Hjax: ive considered getting a more powerful cpu for codingame tests 
 Hjax: that may be going off the deep end though 
 Astrobytes: lol, dedication
 Hjax: i already have a pretty powerful desktop, 6 core 12 thread 
 LelouchVC2: What are you using now?
 Hjax: which can run 2 or 3 games concurrently 
 Hjax: my processor is an 8700k
 Hjax: but imagine the testing on a 16 core 32 thread machine 
 LelouchVC2: and you want something even more powerful?!
 LelouchVC2: Doesn't seem to me it would make the difference.
 Hjax: why not?
 Hjax: can run 3x as many games 
 LelouchVC2: Those are more for servers with heavy loads rather than one heavy loud
 Hjax: yeah but im running many games in parallel 
 LelouchVC2: for servers with many heavy loads*
 Hjax: not one by one 
 LelouchVC2: Why? 
 Hjax: because its faster?
 Hjax: and i want to run 1000s of games 
 LelouchVC2: why are u running multiple games?
 struct: Dont use the referee of othello, its not very fast
 Hjax:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Only 4 cores and 8 threads here
 Hjax: guess ill write my own othello engine using my bitboard lol 
 struct: you can, I just did not think of performance
 Astrobytes: Actually using your own is a lot better
 struct: ^
 Hjax: removes the IO i guess? 
 Astrobytes: Not just for this but any multi you wanna do locally
 Astrobytes: You can optimise it to hell and back
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: some games speed doesnt really matter
 Hjax: UTG was super fast anyway
 Hjax: because my bot only took a couple ms to make a move 
 Astrobytes: Depends how many games you need to run 
 LelouchVC2: I think the performance gain may disappoint you
 Hjax: i usually run 1000 or so 
 Astrobytes: For a statistically significant outcome that is
 Hjax: during contests ill let tests run overnight 
 Hjax: doing 50k games or whatever 
 Astrobytes: Just don't do that in summer
 tomatoes: a lot
 Astrobytes: Well, I guess you probably have a great cooling system so&#160;;)
 tomatoes: i'm doing 100 with swap and then arena time
 LelouchVC2: everytime u cum, u save it
 LelouchVC2: and use it as liquid cooling
 Hjax: ...
 Astrobytes: ...
 LelouchVC2: Are we not open minded inventors?
 Hjax: we are not 7th grade trolls 
 LelouchVC2: old &gt;~&gt;
 Astrobytes: Old eh
 LelouchVC2: Once u pass 7th grade, ur old
 Astrobytes: I am 37
 LelouchVC2: You're practically dead according to Hjax
 Hjax:&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: an 8th grade troll is fine, but those pesky 7th grade trolls
 LelouchVC2:&#160;!
 Hjax: 37 isnt old
 Astrobytes: It's 'mature'
 Hjax: especially when it comes to a site like this, where experience helps a lot
 LelouchVC2: might be taking things too literally and seriously
 Astrobytes: You know I only do this as a hobby Hjax? I'm technically a biologist
 Hjax: i didnt know that!
 Hjax: im a software engineer, and then i go home and write more code 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm assistant manager at my local wildlife conservation centre and I do pharmaceutical regulatory work in my other time
 Astrobytes: And then I code
 Astrobytes: Where do you work Hjax? Well, as in what kind of company that is
 Hjax: its a contractor, makes submarines
 Astrobytes: Oh nice. You'll get along with the Thales guys on here then eh :D
 Hjax: ah neat, they are apparently the 8th largest defense contractor 
 Hjax: i work for the 6th largest, so pretty comparable 
 struct: time to write submarine physics game
 Astrobytes: Nice! Get learning your optimisations so you can beat them :P 
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 Hjax: OOC was a submarine game 
 Hjax: but i didnt like it very much 
 Astrobytes: It was nicer than the pacman game
 Astrobytes: (imo)
 Hjax: i put a lot of effort into the pacman game 
 Hjax: and just ended up annoyed 
 Astrobytes: I wasn't keen on either tbh, but I was quite 'medicated' for the duration
 struct: When I see fog I quit
 struct: On OOC I can understand
 Hjax: i can deal with reasonable amounts of fog 
 Astrobytes: Maybe I'll revisit them when I'm more bored than when I finally feel the need to do UTTT
 Hjax: but both OOC and pacman had absurd amounts 
 Hjax: i really enjoyed the unofficial pr2 contest 
 Astrobytes: At least OOC was actually about that though, it was pointless for pacman
 Astrobytes: Yeah I only put a few hours in to PR2 but I wouldn't have done it otherwise, will definitely revisit it
 struct: I think it's very hard to balance games with fog
 Hjax: my bot was basically just "run munkres and win" 
 struct: I think best fog game is WW
 Hjax: but it was still fun to make 
 Astrobytes: lol I forgot about that being built into python
 Hjax: yep! 
 Astrobytes: I need to improve my WW
 Hjax: usually for contests i spend the first day doing python, just messing around with the inputs 
 Hjax: and then port to java 
 Hjax: but i felt no need to use java for pr2 
 struct: my ww is just eval available moves
 Hjax: python was perfect 
 struct: So depth 0.5 :p
 Hjax: im surprised there arent many python on the leaderboard in pr2 
 Hjax: free munkres makes it pretty easy to get a strong bot 
 Hjax: only 4 python in the top 50, and im the highest rated 
 Astrobytes: Only 4?! 
 Hjax: shocking right?
 Astrobytes: I guess a lot of people didn't realise the benefit of HA
 Astrobytes: Munkres/whatevs
 Hjax: so many names lol
 AntiSquid: the others are python wrapped in C++
 Hjax:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I hadn't come across it until euler's PM for whatever contest it was.. CoIF?
 Astrobytes: He's trolling&#160;;)
 Hjax: ah 
 Hjax: theres someone in the top 5 with js
 Astrobytes: Like recurs e's 'python' bot in CSB
 AntiSquid: HA&#160;?
 Hjax: hungarian algo 
 AntiSquid: ah
 Astrobytes: How's things squiddo
 AntiSquid: just living life ... time passes
 Astrobytes: Ain't that the truth
 AntiSquid: trying to avoid the news to no avail, it's like the world gets crazier every day and some online "friend" find the need to share me some outrageous news
 Hjax: i realized not too long ago how much current events was stressing me out 
 Hjax: i exposed myself to less news and felt way better 
 Astrobytes: I've stopped reading the news every morning now
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: Still catch up with it all at some point but don't make it a daily thing
 Astrobytes: How's your ML journey progressing AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: sorry, i think your previous discussion was more interesting
 AntiSquid: oh well it's a long road
 Astrobytes: You doing Halite?
 AntiSquid: i can play with notebooks and do some basic guesses, but that doesn't count as much
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: i do the more traditional kaggle stuff
 Astrobytes: Hey it's a start eh
 Astrobytes: Even just the analysis part is something to get good at
 AntiSquid: it's what videos recommend, other who rank high were saying what they'd do if they had to start from scratch: get into doing stuff and experiment until you learn
 AntiSquid: so instead of going through massive amounts of theory i go through notebooks and then read theory only as much as i need to understand the notebooks on kaggle
 AntiSquid: this advice is most valid for the math part 
 Astrobytes: Yeah that makes sense I guess
 Astrobytes: You don't just get overloaded and give up at least
 AntiSquid: kaggle is more about analyzing than just pure straight up ML
 AntiSquid: also i find this video like perfect introduction to data science:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC-c7E5PK0Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC-c7E5PK0Y</a>just use what you need and what works :p 
 AntiSquid: basically like CG contests, if just basic if-else wins use that 
 Astrobytes: Hey, us biologists are natural data scientists, we just get the bioinformatics guys to do the work for us
 Astrobytes: But yeah, definitely use what you need and don't overcomplicate, it applies to many fields
 AntiSquid: contests are messy on kaggle
 AntiSquid: might get a bronze medal and it's not even because i fiddled with the parameters of a notebook&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i mean i didn't even find good magic numbers
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't bother too much about achievements for now, as you say, just learning is enough
 AntiSquid: well harder to work on something that isn't active at the moment
 AntiSquid: as opposed to something people discuss and release new ideas frequently
 Astrobytes: Your main goal right now is learning so it's not a huge issue. There are probably more useful communities elsewhere if you wanna discuss stuff, I heard Kaggle isn't great for that
 AntiSquid: who said that?
 AntiSquid: i mean whenever someone shares a new notebook there's a discussion on it and then someone takes that notebook improves on it or modifies it, shares the new version and then there's new discussion ...
 Astrobytes: Dunno, some people said the community was a little averse to being helpful at times (hey, I don't know what they asked - could've been bullshit, I'm happy to have a fresh opinion)
 Astrobytes: Well, that seems pretty cool
 AntiSquid: winwin was struggling with submitting a notebook, i kept trying to give him directions, not sure if you meant him
 Astrobytes: Maybe some people didn't get the concept
 Astrobytes: No no, I think he got it in the end no?
 AntiSquid: the UI is a bit confusing
 AntiSquid: idk, i have to ask
 AntiSquid: hopefully
 AntiSquid: maybe it depends what you ask
 AntiSquid: people there expect you to try and google some of the basics first
 AntiSquid: maybe it's comparable to asking here how to implement tracking the game state?
 AntiSquid: or even something more basic
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's why I disclaimered by saying I donno what they asked :P
 AntiSquid: most interesting part about kaggle is how people combine models
 AntiSquid: can't really do that on CG due to time constraints ... but imagine combining MCTS + GA + meanmax + whatever and then taking an average or a percentage of each prediction to use in the final answer
 Astrobytes: I'll forgive your 'meanmax' there, but yeah, it's quite something when you have unlimited time to be able to use all these approaches 
 AntiSquid: minimax 
 AntiSquid: :D
 Astrobytes: Way too much CG for you, /ban :P
 AntiSquid: too much kaggle maybe or too long break from CG type of challenges
 Astrobytes: GA to tune your minimax eval param coeffs, minimax as 'eval' in your MCTS
 AntiSquid: didn't even follow the halite subforum to see what people there are doing, but last i checked they had weak halite bots
 Astrobytes: I've not looked recently, too much going on atm
 Astrobytes: Just CGing for now, it's comfortable&#160;:)
 Hjax: kaggle halite is a disappointment imo 
 AntiSquid: it is from our perspective, not sure it's the same for a kaggle regular, it might be a fresh interesting concept to them
 Astrobytes: Just doesn't seem like the right platform as opposed to how it was before. I'd been looking forward to participate in it's old format.
 Astrobytes: But AntiSquid is right I guess
 AntiSquid: aicrowd since the actual ML centered contest website, not kaggle which is more about analyzing data, but got into too much trouble, submitted some random modified starter code for aicrowd and dropped it for now 
 AntiSquid: aicrowd seems to be *
 Astrobytes: Ah right, I see the difference even at a cursory glance
 AntiSquid: that train challenge was won by C++ wrapped in python last year, now they changed the way they give out the prizes for this year's (hardly modified) version:
 AntiSquid: The top three teams in the final round which use a reinforcement learning approach for their winning submission will be awarded one travel grant each.
 AntiSquid: for aicrowd 
 Astrobytes: I'm out, painkillers getting the better of me. Catch you guys later
 Hjax: cya 
 AntiSquid: gn8 Astrobytes
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have been summoned by a necropost on one of my forum posts
 BenjaminUrquhart: hi
 sb613: hi
 tiwariji264: hi
 kdhakal: plz share code
 sb613: For which puzzle?
 tiwariji264: Your task it to print a grid of width w and height h made out of periods ('.'). Every coordinate on the grid that is inside the rectangle, which has two opposite corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), should be a plus sign ('+') instead of a period.The upper-left corner has the coordinate (0, 0).

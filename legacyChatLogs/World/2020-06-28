 Raghuveer: rules

 TheSpiffiest: Can anyone direct me to code for PID loops? I haven't done them before.
 Raghuveer: i got the answer already

 N0Mana: Hi, how do I turn Java to C# in codingame puzzles?
 LelouchVC2: There should be a drop down to change languages
 LelouchVC2: Just click on where the language ur using is displayed
 N0Mana: Oh there, ye I just didnt look hard enough. thanks!
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 N0Mana: haven't used this account for years, and I've actually been learning C# in Unity.
 LelouchVC2: No idea
 LelouchVC2: C# and Python run fast on here though, faster than C++
 N0Mana: I see.Well looking at the frameworks, it does seem like base C#
 struct: I dont know why you keep claiming that python runs faster than c++
 Uljahn: ye, that's bs
 LelouchVC2: Idk why Jesus had long hair
 LelouchVC2: but some facts we have to acceptt
 LelouchVC2: Btw, I never said Python runs faster than C++
 LelouchVC2: I say specifically on *this* site
 struct: Which is still not true
 LelouchVC2: Which is clearly true
 LelouchVC2: Go look for yourself
 LelouchVC2: Start anything, and write the code in C++ and C#
 LelouchVC2: Run through the test cases
 LelouchVC2: C++ goes through them a few seconds per test
 LelouchVC2: C# runs through them like butter
 struct: compilation time?
 Uljahn: lol
 LelouchVC2: Why would it compile for every test?
 struct: I dont know
 LelouchVC2: I don't know why you attacked my claim if you didn't even test it yourself
 struct: What is your definition of faster?
 struct: For me compilation time doesnt matter
 LelouchVC2: How could you possibly know if it compiles the code every time?
 LelouchVC2: And even if it does, that means code is not optimized, which makes C++ still slower
 LelouchVC2: "fast" is relative
 LelouchVC2: On this site, fast would be how quickly ur code runs through the test cases
 LelouchVC2: If this includes compilation time, so be it.
 LelouchVC2: Real world, compilation time is once, and then the code will run nicely with C++. Run-time is whats important
 LelouchVC2: But in this site, in CoC, when you've got a time limit and have to finish faster than others
 struct: Well in multiplayers the compilation time is not taken into account
 LelouchVC2: I wouldn't know, just pissed me off when I tried out C#
 LelouchVC2: And it blasted through the test cases
 LelouchVC2: I realize how disadvantaged I was in CoC
 struct: Does the first test case take longer?
 LelouchVC2: No, all equal time
 LelouchVC2: if run-time on CG servers is not the issue
 LelouchVC2: Then it's retarded that it's compiling it over and over again
 Uljahn: CG engine is very old
 LelouchVC2: omfg
 LelouchVC2: No wonder I lost to ruby in fastest. we were both done in under 30 seconds
 LelouchVC2: I just tested the solution with ruby, it literally just destroyed like 8 tests in 6 seconds
 LelouchVC2: C++ took 6 seconds to finish like 2-3 tests
 dbdr: I would be surprised if the compilation and running time mattered
 dbdr: when you submit is what should matter
 LelouchVC2: I think the point went over your head
 LelouchVC2: If It takes me 3x longer to test my code
 LelouchVC2: than someone else
 dbdr: oh sure, that matters
 LelouchVC2:&#160;:(
 dbdr: use the best tool for the job, as always
 MSmits: this has nothing to do with the engine though? C++ simply has to be recompiled when you change the code. Nothing weird about it. And yeah dev-speed suffers.
 MSmits: kinda ballsy to do coc with c++ also :P
 struct: MSmits but they did not need to recompile code for each test case
 MSmits: thats true yes
 MSmits: what happens when you test all at once?
 MSmits: will it recompile each time?
 MSmits: doubt that
 struct: I guess
 MSmits: I mean the test all button
 MSmits: I can't imagine they would not use the same compiled code, would be silly to recompile
 struct: well they do that in multis dont they?
 MSmits: multis dont have a test all button
 MSmits: its just a single test
 jacek: can someone explain l2 norm. is it just adding lambda * sum(w^2) to the cost and nothing more?
 jacek: im talking about code. fancy math mentions some derivative in weight update
 jacek: but i think weight update should go as usual, the different cost function should cover it right?
 jacek: or is it cost the same, but update is more like w[i] = w[i] + alpha*delta - 0.0001 * w[i]
 jacek: doh i hate fancy math
 dbdr: they don't recompile each time in multis anymore
 MSmits: jacek are you throwing NN tensormath around now?
 MSmits: what's this world coming to
 Uljahn: do you mean l2 regularization?
 jacek: eeyup
 Uljahn: there are two ways i think, the second one is almost yours:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2017/09/01/neural-network-l2.aspx">https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2017/09/01/neural-network-l2.aspx</a>
 Uljahn: so L1 decays weigths by a constant value while L2 decays by a percentage
 jacek: thankies
 Dick121380: When I was to participate in Clash of Code, it notified me that I must prove I'm not robot,but how to?:tired_face:
 Dick121380: There is no new pages loaded
 Uljahn: google captcha doesn't work in china
 yshing: Get yourself out
 MSmits: Dick121380 if you can't figure out, you must be a robot :P
 WINWINWIN: :D

 linjoehan: hey I'm puzzle of the week woo hoo
 eulerscheZahl: congrats for becoming a puzzle linjoehan
 MSmits: nice job, I'm just a test case
 MSmits: or was it headcase? I forogt
 MSmits: forgot
 jacek: pacman puzzle of the week?
 eulerscheZahl: checkers
 jacek: pacman checkers?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2sDtTbzHiI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2sDtTbzHiI</a>rock paper scissors checkers - kind of...
 linjoehan: what a great game
 dbdr: the rules were not completely clear to me
 Scarfield: if pawns have the same of RPS choose one, and fight agian. then there is one trap and a flag that apperently has to be captured
 linjoehan: I think the trap can't move and the flag means you lose
 linjoehan: or win
 dbdr: sometimes you see the opponent kind
 dbdr: but you can change it anyways
 Scarfield: after a fight you know the winners kind, and if you fight them with the same "weapon" they can choose
 Scarfield: otherwise they fight with the same as what the pawn won with last
 dbdr: coming soon to CG?
 Scarfield: too little FoW
 Scarfield: you here Hjax?&#160;:)
 Uljahn: that game looks similar to stratego
 eulerscheZahl: "too little FoW"
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507644dbe6bc6fc318eeaa25e26e48954355</a>oh, up for approval
 eulerscheZahl: seems that he fixed the crashes on longer games
 eulerscheZahl: 200 turns on the large map, 150kB replay size
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure this can be improved. But it's not crashing anymore
 struct: yeah also noticed that
 struct: if he rename sprites I think it will also change a lot
 struct: ok it will only save 1846 chars
 MSmits: is this 9x9 go? Or are the rules different?
 MSmits: I see typo's in the statement also
 eulerscheZahl: 13x13
 MSmits: "Beside these simple rules there are a view more rules, on where stones can be placed and where not."
 eulerscheZahl: a view
 MSmits: I doubt there is any need to go beyond 9x9
 tutubalin: this Rock-Paper-Scissors Stratego was an addon for ICQ
 MSmits: it's nowhere near solved is it?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, was an ICQ game
 eulerscheZahl: i also remember a few other mini games. i really liked the pool game back then. and the war sheeps
 jacek: 7x7 is weakly solved
 tutubalin: Rock Paper Scissors<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxbu80okI_U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jxbu80okI_U</a>
 jacek: storms \o/
 dbdr: Atari go is supposed to be until the first capture
 dbdr: not just smaller board compared to Go
 jacek: atari go is smaller go fitted in atari 2600
 eulerscheZahl: but how do i run it on my commodore?
 jacek: play commodore go
 dbdr: 2x2 go
 darkhorse64: With handicap&#160;?
 brand: hello all 
 tutubalin: I prefer ZX Spectrum go
 tutubalin: board is divided in 8x8 areas with 2 allowed colors per each
 CaptainKitten_382c: hello 
 Yeet6969: bb
 Yeet6969: no
 Zenoscave: no 4004 go?
 Ruukasu: Clash of code go go
 Anthua: haha
 WINWINWIN: Can someone explain how to save the output from a notebook on Kaggle?
 WINWINWIN: :P
 AbundantPuddle: I wish I actually could be more help, but I am not familiar with Kaggle at all.
 WINWINWIN: Np&#160;:)

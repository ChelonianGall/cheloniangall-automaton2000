 AbundantPuddle: Sorry
 MostComplicatedUsername: My cg rank has gone down too... used to be 3990
 ArianPunk: Guys, is ANEO puzzle a graphic game? I can only see game description and console, not the game window.
 AbundantPuddle:  I'm not sure ArianPunk. Lemme take a gander.
 AbundantPuddle: I am going to say no gfx.
 ArianPunk: I think there's no game window
 ArianPunk: yup
 ArianPunk: how could one solve it then 
 AbundantPuddle: Code? Lol.
 AbundantPuddle: I would use debugging and check the test case inputs and outputs.
 ArianPunk: right
 AbundantPuddle: All traffic lights start green than duration green and duration red.
 jacek: ohai
 struct: morning
 Jasperr: :wave:
 jacek: hows yinsh approval
 struct: still pending
 struct: I guess I could just try and reupload it, but Ill let them find the bug
 AbundantPuddle: I approve
 AbundantPuddle: I thought I found a bug. Turns out it was just a fly on my monitor.
 struct: Go more approvals
 struct: 20 approvals and I delete
 AbundantPuddle: I honestly have no clue how that game is even played.
 struct: which game?
 AbundantPuddle: Yinsh
 struct: Can be a bit hard to understand at first
 struct: First time I looked at line board I couldnt understand it
 WINWINWIN: struct arent there 3 appovals?
 struct: There are like 9 
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes, TricTrac and AntiSquid?
 struct: But its bugged
 struct: 3rd never goes through
 WINWINWIN: I see, what did codingame team say?
 struct: seems like a :bug: to me :frowning: I reported it to the devs
 WINWINWIN: Delete it and resend it did not work?
 struct: Didnt try
 struct: better fix the bugs
 WINWINWIN: :D
 WINWINWIN: Any other MPs with bugs?
 struct: no clue
 AbundantPuddle: A worm? Uh-oh!
 solaimanope: is there any tool to combine all files in a java project into a single file?
 solaimanope: so that the single file can then be submitted in CG arena
 [CG]Thibaud: search "java single file" in the forum
 [CG]Thibaud: there are several topics about it
 GauravGosain: how do i fix this

 jrke: hey i have problem in my angle func look it always return me 90* its for CSB
 jrke: plz help
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/LsQnXDnr">https://pastebin.com/LsQnXDnr</a>
 WINWINWIN: Yes, last chat at 3hrs ago
 daffie: it's probably not a prblem in there, it's a issue where you're not using that function and sending 90 somewhere
 Xcalibre: jrke, since px, x, py, y and d are integers, (px-x)/d and (py-y)/d will round down to the nearest integer. cast any one of the operands in each expression to a double.
 mohammadhei05: hfge
 Xcalibre: if d &gt; (px-x) then dx will evaluate to 0, and ang will evaluate to acos(0)*(180/3.14) which is 90.046.
 Trice: Please share code if 100%
 Trice: Sorry
 Trice: Wrong chat :D
 cegprakash: jrke I'll give u mine
 cegprakash: jrke I shared u in India chat
 cegprakash: ur PI is inaccurate jrke
 cegprakash: I use float PI = 3.14159265359;
 cegprakash: oh nice
 cegprakash: Astrobytes what do u think is the safest way to start simultaneous games?
 cegprakash: like minimax is for alternate turn games
 struct: What do you mean ceg?
 cegprakash: games where both players play together 
 cegprakash: and don't know what other player moved this turn
 struct: Yeah, I know what it is, but what does this mean, "what do u think is the safest way to start simultaneous games?"
 cegprakash: something that helps reach gold easily
 cegprakash: or even legend
 Astrobytes: Safest?
 Astrobytes: Which game?
 cegprakash: MeanMax for example
 Astrobytes: What do you use for CSB?
 struct: Why do you want easy legend?
 cegprakash: CSB gold boss is too weak
 struct: Go do uttt
 struct: easy legend
 cegprakash: UTTT is alternate player game
 cegprakash:&#160;:\
 cegprakash: 
 cegprakash: just random search
 Astrobytes: Try that first then
 cegprakash: 2 runners no collision
 cegprakash: nno opponent prediction
 cegprakash: safest = with opponent prediction
 cegprakash: and make a safe move
 Astrobytes: Well write a good sim, and try random first
 cegprakash: u can take spring challenge also 
 cegprakash: as an example
 cegprakash: I didn't know what to do at all
 cegprakash: for opponent prediction
 RoboStac: both good examples of games where opponent prediction barely matters&#160;:)
 mihalkoss: hy
 cegprakash: top 10 predicts them 
 RoboStac: you said legend, not top 10
 Astrobytes: ^
 cegprakash: Saeleos won with opponent predictionn
 cegprakash: well I want top 10
 RoboStac: don't expect anything easy then 
 Astrobytes: ceg always wants the path of least resistance, then blames the leaderboard for not getting high placement&#160;;)
 struct: top 10 where?
 cegprakash: Saeleos did something like a nnested GA
 cegprakash: GA inside GA inside GA which can be very sloooow going depth
 Astrobytes: I guess if you're doing Mean Max you want a GA or SA or something
 Astrobytes: I haven't done anything for it seriously yet
 cegprakash: he does a GA on enemy
 cegprakash: how does he do that :O 
 Astrobytes: spend x ms running it for the enemy, spend the rest on you?
 cegprakash: but how will the moves talk to each other
 cegprakash: my move and opponent move
 Astrobytes: Dear god, not today ceg please
 cegprakash: minimax talks to each other
 cegprakash: is there annyway to achieve something like that in GA?
 Astrobytes: I'm still trying to recover from the minimax 'tutorials'
 struct: maximax
 Astrobytes: Prune Array
 cegprakash: it's negamax
 cegprakash: there is nothing called maximax
 cegprakash: what u guys talking about
 cegprakash: what array?
 struct: Just try Smitsimax
 cegprakash: but smitsimax ignores opponennnt moves
 cegprakash: opponent can kill u ur bot ignores it
 cegprakash: " For example, if a game allows 4 types of moves: A, B, C and D and if in some situations caused by the opponent, move C is illegal, then this search will not work. "
 cegprakash: I'm trying to understand Nash equilibrium
 Astrobytes: There's this search engine... 
 wlesavo: segamegamax
 cegprakash: wlesavo there is nothing called segamegamax u drunk?
 Astrobytes: Whoosh... there it goes
 cegprakash: wait what

 cegprakash: I've used this same strat on pacman
 cegprakash: that's why I'm top 50
 cegprakash: I mean without my own knowledge 
 351062: gg
 cegprakash: I was thinking I did a GA&#160;:\ but what I've done is a minnimax?
 Astrobytes: WTAF
 cegprakash: yeah this table is constructed during my GA&#160;:\ 
 cegprakash: I know it's weird
 cegprakash: nnow I don't know whether to call a GA or minimax
 cegprakash: it's a GAimax?
 Astrobytes: ...
 351062: How about cegimax
 Astrobytes: No, that's his other one, with the Prune Array
 Neumann: Oh
 cegprakash: what prune array
 cegprakash: okay
 Neumann: So many search algos ..
 Astrobytes: ceg, I really think you ought to do some research and reading of papers/definitions/implementations. It will benefit you.
 cegprakash: hey stop trolling me
 pb4: "I've used this same strat on pacman"   ---&gt;    After building the payoff matrix, how did you choose a move from the matrix&#160;?
 Astrobytes: That's not a troll ceg. I am completely serious.
 Neumann: That's litterrally the only non-troll message he wrote
 cegprakash: I always assume enemy's intention is to kill me
 cegprakash: that's like the perfect counter
 cegprakash: to my moves
 pb4: Unclear
 cegprakash: pb4
 pb4: Matrix won't kill you
 pb4: It just has rows and columns
 cegprakash: I have an eval to find the payoff
 pb4: Right, that fills the matrix
 pb4: Now you have the matrix, what do you do&#160;?
 cegprakash: so I move I play opponennt counter move
 cegprakash: that's how my GA i pacman works
 pb4: Unclear again
 cegprakash: *in
 cegprakash: so it's basically a minimax
 Astrobytes: The GA that you're not sure if it's a GA or a minimax, right? That one?
 Uljahn: :popcorn:
 cegprakash: yeah
 cegprakash: it's GAimax
 Astrobytes: I... just... :shrug:
 cegprakash: pb4
 cegprakash: I choose a random move
 cegprakash: for enemy I play a counter to this move
 cegprakash: then I go to next depth
 cegprakash: choose a random move
 cegprakash: pfor enemy I play the counter to this move
 Astrobytes: Um...
 struct: so you play and then make a move for opponent and eval the opponent move to choose the best?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: but I only play enemy it if there is a counter move for me otherwise I assume enemy doesn't move
 struct: Seems to have a few flaws
 cegprakash: that's a loophole
 cegprakash: if i fix that easy top 10
 wlesavo: fix it 
 Uljahn: ^
 cegprakash: and I don't have a perfect opponent tracking
 cegprakash: like Saeleous does
 cegprakash: and I onnly assume enemy's intention is to kill me.. if he can't kill me he should eat the best pellets around him annd spawn nenw pacman if there are multiple pacmanns around him
 cegprakash: that's what saelous does
 cegprakash: so may be he is using GAimax
 pb4: Saelyos*
 cegprakash: and I used partial GAimax
 Astrobytes: Where is the genetic/evolutionary aspect of this particular algorithm?
 Neumann: I'm closing the chat, I cannot work with that much entertainment on my second screen
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: Someone remind reCurse to check the chat logs later
 struct: Neumann its free knowledge
 struct: you should know GAimax
 Uljahn: i guess it's just MCimax not GAimax
 Astrobytes: Looks like an MC to me alright
 struct: I cant really see a benefit of it 
 cegprakash: why do everyone troll me
 cegprakash: when I found something amazinng
 Uljahn: but GAimax sounds pretty close to Gainax, that's cool
 Astrobytes: You are... possibly trolling yourself
 wlesavo: could it be that ceg is calling monte carlo GA 
 Uljahn: yep
 Astrobytes: *imax
 cegprakash: once I learn MCTS I'll find a way to do MCimax
 struct: good luck
 Astrobytes: I strongly suggest you start with less complexity than MCTS. Just my humble opinion. There are some... gaps, in your knowledge.
 AntiSquid: first time reading about gaymax algo AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: muh and a game with best cards at once
 cegprakash: it's not gaymax wtf
 wlesavo: jojomax
 cegprakash: it's GAimax
 cegprakash: i not y
 AntiSquid: same difference
 Astrobytes: Can you just call it MC please, the GA part is really triggering me
 pb4: Same pronunciation :D
 Astrobytes: And how did the payoff matrix fit into this?
 cegprakash: pb4 nooooo
 wlesavo: gaymax should be a legit meme
 struct: have you tried GAimax on CSB?
 AntiSquid: it's not a meme, it's GA and MM with payoff matrix
 struct: I think you probably get top 5
 Astrobytes: I'm rapidly losing the ability to find words here
 cegprakash: struct yes I'll try but I hate collisions
 Astrobytes: And you want to do Mean Max?
 eulerscheZahl: then avoid them and go straight to the next checkpoint
 eulerscheZahl: he did mean max already
 cegprakash: that's not how GAimax works
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u should also learn GAimax
 eulerscheZahl: simplified the engine, used floats and was confused why his results didn't match
 cegprakash: I foudn it
 aCat: hey anyone can tell me how many simulations per turn he got in UTTT?
 struct: Where did you sucesfully implemented GAimax?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, he wanted easy legend strat for it eulerscheZahl
 struct: aCat around 26-30k on 2nd turn
 cegprakash: PacMan struct
 eulerscheZahl: 20k-25k full rollouts in early game for legend
 AntiSquid: i don't understand what a partial gaimax is btw
 eulerscheZahl: top players get about 100k
 Astrobytes: Astrobytes 01:38PMceg always wants the path of least resistance, then blames the leaderboard for not getting high placement&#160;;)
 struct: My sim count is low because my MCTS is not true mcts
 aCat: (normal turn, my current timelimit is  95ms)
 struct: I dont expland and do rollout
 aCat: omg
 AntiSquid: how many sims can you get with a gaimax&#160;?
 aCat: I got like 8k in 2-4 turn
 AntiSquid: wow
 aCat: flat mc
 eulerscheZahl: just do x2 or x3, easy legend :rofl:
 AntiSquid: oh i thought you already implemented gaimax
 struct: aCat what language?
 aCat: I suppose it will be legend with this result If i switch from flatmc to mcts
 cegprakash: I did AntiSquid
 aCat: java
 aCat: I did it year ago
 AntiSquid: was talking to acat, ceg
 aCat: and i was sure it was kinda fast
 struct: I do have mcts, but my mcts expands the tree everytime it makes a move
 struct: so it isnt expand and do rollout
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/469699427">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/469699427</a>i print my sim count aCat, bottom legend
 aCat: not bitboards though
 eulerscheZahl: used to be higher before CG changed servers
 AntiSquid: what's the percentage for? and the last number i don't understand either
 cegprakash: partial GAimax = find counter moves only for certainn moves
 eulerscheZahl: my win probability. and the expected number of turns till the game ends
 cegprakash: which are easy to find
 struct: 0x7f57c40f0010 Visits: 25000 score -3617move board index: 0 move pos: 0 childs 90x7f57c40f0028 Visits: 4895 score 763move board index: 5 move pos: 0 childs 9Used nodes: 10115722Expansion counter: 1287613
 struct: the first one is root
 pb4: On a more serious note
 AntiSquid: doesn't all that tracking slow down the code a bit?
 pb4: The "simultaneous GA" that Saelyos used is basically Boss3 on BR
 aCat: eulerscheZahl can you play one more game against me?
 cegprakash: Boss3?
 struct: wood 3 boss
 pb4: The boss you still need to beat&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: no need
 AntiSquid: you are enough you do enough

 aCat: thanks 
 aCat: with time ai'm more and more slow
 aCat: but yeah its still not mcts
 aCat: might be significant
 struct: What  league are you atm aCat?
 aCat: #155 gold
 struct: With plain MC?
 aCat: yep
 aCat: ^^'
 Astrobytes: And no bitboards 
 struct: I was like silver with MC
 aCat: my board is 100 ints array
 aCat: sorry chars\
 aCat: so it's like optimizing to work on arrays
 aCat: but not on bits
 struct: my board is like 18 int16
 struct: + 2
 struct: so around 20
 aCat: after &gt; year I suppose I will finally add MC here
 aCat: *MCTS
 struct: There are java bots at legend
 struct: so there is hope
 Astrobytes: Just switch to Lua aCat&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: i was silver with something stupid like outputing possible_moves[-3] 
 wlesavo: struct im mid gold with depth 1 eval bot, but i think teccle s heuristics is a big part of this raiting
 struct: he uses heuristics?
 struct: real AI?!?!
 wlesavo: i mean returning to the same board
 wlesavo: plain mc did much worse for me, but i had like 200-300 rollouts :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: that's merely better than random
 wlesavo: not even sure if it is better than random
 ArianPunk: Will it buy me a job if I solve all the puzzles?
 ZarthaxX: nop
 ArianPunk: :D
 DoubleBreakfast_ff7c: bois
 Astrobytes: bois de construction...?
 DoubleBreakfast_ff7c: i have recieved a email from ea that i was considered as a candidate for an software engineer internship and they sent a test to this site what should i expect coding chalenges or theory or both&#160;?
 DoubleBreakfast_ff7c: i have never had an internship before any advice very usefull 
 DoubleBreakfast_ff7c: is*
 Astrobytes: about halfway down this page in this link you'll see a sample of what it'll be like (interactive):<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/">https://www.codingame.com/work/offers/screening/</a>
 Astrobytes: Then, do some puzzles from here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 Astrobytes: They'll be testing your language knowledge and problem solving skills I should imagine
 DoubleBreakfast_ff7c: how hard is it .i mean i have used c# to code a simple game in unity before and never had any problems in highschool at c++ 
 eulerscheZahl: difficulty can vary
 ArianPunk: Astrobytes, You wanna say these puzzles will buy him the success at his interview?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures</a>
 Astrobytes: I've never done one of the assessments  but I believe it's based on what position you're applying for
 eulerscheZahl: that would be an easy question
 Astrobytes: That's not what I am saying ArianPunk. He has been given an assessment to do on codingame from a potential employer. That's how codingame makes money (among other things)
 eulerscheZahl: the interviewer can decide which questions you have to solve. some got the question from above. but i have no idea what EA is doing
 jacek: as for uttt, teccles thing alone improved my position from ~15th to 6th
 AntiSquid: quite sure the interview questions are generally at medium puzzle level max
 DoubleBreakfast_ff7c: it is for the software engineer position
 jacek: and i see it significantly strengthens first player
 Astrobytes: ArianPunk, the puzzles are a good way to get familiar with the format and the level of difficulty expexted
 struct: They should add space maze to interview questions
 Astrobytes: *expected
 AntiSquid: what teccles thing in uttt?
 eulerscheZahl: if you play on an empty board, make opponent play in the same cells
 eulerscheZahl: that is: opponent send you to top center and there is no cell set so far, you send the opponent back
 jacek: i think this allows first player to fill be first in mini boards and increase his chances to win them
 AntiSquid: that sounds good
 ArianPunk: His internship and the fact that EA referred him to CG was a right-on-time thing to answer my question.
 Astrobytes: Solving puzzles alone will not get you a job though. Which is what you asked earlier.
 ArianPunk: I asked it sarcastically as I laughed afterward.
 eulerscheZahl: and as the interviewer can define own questions, you might not even know the task. even if you solved everything on CG
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: The task is to approve Yinsh
 struct: Good luck
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: i failed
 struct: Did you try?
 AntiSquid: the puzzles won't buy him success, but if he fails the interview question / puzzle do you expect him to get the job ArianPunk&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: yes but it popped a message when i did
 ZarthaxX: *can't approve such bad multi*
 struct: Oh, so now even approved messages wont go through
 struct: ...
 ZarthaxX: im kidding
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 struct: Its bugged ZarthaxX
 struct: game cant be approved
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 struct: I think its my fault
 ZarthaxX: maybe if you delete account
 ZarthaxX: and restart
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 struct: I think I tried to approve my own contribution with POST
 jacek: or maybe theres conflict name in DB
 struct: but Im not sure
 ZarthaxX: lol
 struct: cant really remember if I did it or not
 AntiSquid: i can confirm with an alt, deleting account makes your contrib unstuck
 ZarthaxX: tbh i didnt approve your thing
 jacek: if approve doenst work, does reject work?
 AntiSquid: i think not
 ZarthaxX: many people approved your multi
 ZarthaxX: or no?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: hi Zarthachloride
 ZarthaxX: is it really stuck
 AntiSquid: yes

 jacek: lol reject works
 AntiSquid: rigged
 ZarthaxX: internal error
 ZarthaxX: oh god
 Astrobytes: Conspiracy
 struct: Do 3 rejects work?
 AntiSquid: CG staff hate hexagons
 ZarthaxX: i will reject
 struct: LOL
 struct: you cant remove the reject now jacek
 struct: due to bug
 jacek: unreject
 ZarthaxX: it works
 struct: ah ok
 struct: it worked
 jacek: i delete the reject
 AntiSquid: guys let's test if the downvote button still works
 struct: let me try to reject
 AntiSquid: i deleted approval and redone it
 struct: Now try to approve
 struct: Someone
 ArianPunk: Is having high lvl on CG a good thing to be mentioned in your CV?
 jacek: not working
 struct: lol
 Stilgart: what's all this noise?
 Astrobytes: Nope, just error struct
 struct: Sorry Stilgart
 ZarthaxX: ArianPunk you could be a copypaster
 ZarthaxX: but i guess it's no harm to mention so
 struct: Yinsh is bugged and we were trying to approve it
 Stilgart: struct: no need to be sorry, there seems to be a major issue here
 ArianPunk: You mean a solver who cheats the solutions?
 Stilgart: bugged in which way?
 struct: It cant be approved

 Astrobytes: What if you reject fully? Then try to reupload?
 Stilgart: many contribs are bugged (espacially CoCs)
 struct: 3rd approval wont work
 ZarthaxX: ArianPunk yes, there are many solutions available on the internet
 jacek: maybe theres buffer overflow for 3
 ZarthaxX: manypeople have copypasted
 ArianPunk: yup
 AntiSquid: getting high rank in contest imo does ArianPunk and if the interviewer smirks or frowns at a top 50 rank then tell them to hire a HR with background in IT, not in geography
 Astrobytes: Oh so approvals are not working for other contribs too Stilgart?
 struct: Astrobytes, I could, but I want CG to find the bug
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: no
 ZarthaxX: so the whole system is stuck
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Stilgart: that is why I asked for the nature of the bug
 Astrobytes: OK 
 Stilgart: this one is news to me
 struct: The bug is on approval
 Stilgart: what about other puzzles in the same category&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ping someone in the Bug thread on discord again struct, see if they've made any progress
 Stilgart: we approved King Domino not so long ago
 struct: I'll ping them tomorrow
 struct: Don't want to pressure them
 Stilgart: (King domino is the real name of Code of the Realm)
 Astrobytes: Such a kind soul struct &lt;3 :P
 ArianPunk: @Antiswuad aha.
 AntiSquid: Don't put off until tomorrow what you SHOULD do today!!! struct ping them now!
 jacek: no, do it tomorrow. lets pressure them on friday afternoon
 Stilgart: bad idea
 AntiSquid: i see jacek knows how to plan ahead
 Stilgart: the site might be down all the week-end
 Stilgart: due to a bad friday push
 jacek: friday is release day
 AntiSquid: yes
 struct: I have to reject someone contribution just for test
 AntiSquid: should be on every interview "when is release day?" 
 Stilgart: when it's time
 AntiSquid: wrong
 AntiSquid: friday
 Astrobytes: "Always push to the live server on Friday afternoons" - true/false
 Stilgart: fortunately, I don't date if you think it's wrong&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: unless friday is bank holiday, then you do it thursday
 Stilgart: (and also, I can decide when to push my releases)
 AntiSquid: that was an interview question
 struct: OupsAn error occurred (#571): "Action not allowed for CodinGamer 1540478".

 AntiSquid: it will auto approve
 Tiramon: yay my first neural network is working on cg (more or less, like me it missed one rule&#160;;) )
 AntiSquid: game?
 eulerscheZahl: the rule to leave a valid action to your opponent
 Tiramon: oware abaqa ... it's a easy setting
 Tiramon: right eulerscheZahl
 Tiramon: was wondering why it stil didn't avoid invalid actions until i found out that is also an invalid one&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: how did you train it while leaving out one rule?
 Usamaliaquat: that was great
 Tiramon: it's a dqn .. it's learning wihtout knowing the rules ... and i used the referee
 Tiramon: so it was no problem that i missed it
 Tiramon: my goal for this evening is to switch from dqn, fixed Q, ER to a dqn with PER, maybe this  solves this invalid actions
 Neon_Tuts: Hi
 struct: Hi
 struct: "FYI, the approval bug has been fixed but is not delivered yet."
 struct: Nice
 Astrobytes: Nice Tiramon
 Astrobytes: struct, they're waiting for Friday afternoon
 Tiramon: was always wondering why i didn't get below 14% invalid actions ...
 AntiSquid: maybe they automated it and a script will auto update saturday early morning 
 struct: What will break next
 Tiramon: ok it's running with PER ... let's see if it helps
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes is that a cookie dough cat? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/9465e598a3709ee35fc186375949163c0361892">https://www.codingame.com/profile/9465e598a3709ee35fc186375949163c0361892</a>

 Astrobytes: I think that was a seal or something
 Uljahn: cricri from Hélène et les garçons? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Yeah lol, personal joke
 Near_you: вы тупорылые гавноеды которые были только что в моем комнате
 Astrobytes: Join #ru Near_you
 Uljahn: wow rude
 Uljahn: he's already there :unamused:
 Astrobytes: Yes I did a quick translate
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, reCurse, kicking required
 wlesavo: wow, google translation is surprisingly good
 Astrobytes: Sometimes...
 wlesavo: wouldn't expect it to get this one right
 Astrobytes: It usually fails on things you would not expect it to fail at :D
 wlesavo: lol
 WINWINWIN: Tiramon how far did the neural network get?
 eulerscheZahl: rank 155 out of 165 players
 eulerscheZahl: but he's still working on it
 Astrobytes: Oh he submitted?
 WINWINWIN: Are the top spots in all multis NNs?
 Astrobytes: DArkhorse and Smits are MCTS w/ EPT
 eulerscheZahl: and wlesavo i can confirm that google translate is readable for RU =&gt; ENthat's how I played the last mini RAIC
 Astrobytes: in Oware WINWINWIN
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even struggle to understand the rules
 Astrobytes: Not in all multis
 WINWINWIN: Ok
 AntiSquid: ah after checking google translate i see the ban was indeed justified
 LelouchVC2: Who got banned?
 LelouchVC2: And if you say "who", I'm going to suicide
 Astrobytes: *commit suicide
 LelouchVC2: I'm going to shove a hot poker up my nostril and suicide
 Astrobytes: *commit suicide
 LelouchVC2: I'm going to suicide
 Astrobytes: Right...
 LelouchVC2: I bet you'd grammar check code comments too&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: No. I only do it when I feel like it, for amusement usually
 Astrobytes: Especially for ridiculous statements :P
 Astrobytes: But it was some Belarussian user who was being nasty in #ru and here
 LelouchVC2: feel like it; for amusement*
 Astrobytes: :D
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 AntiSquid: very odd choice of words
 AntiSquid: "committing suicide if i don't get an answer regarding who got banned + i am going to do it in this specific odd lobotomizing way"
 AntiSquid: you could end up being disabled and fail to suicide idk ...
 Astrobytes: Often the outcome with many attempted methods.
 Astrobytes: Though males are usually more successful than females iirc, due to choice of method.
 eulerscheZahl: and possibilities
 AntiSquid: ya the gender death gap is still an issue
 eulerscheZahl: we can pee on an electric fence
 Astrobytes: So can a woman
 Astrobytes: Just takes a little more.. .efort
 eulerscheZahl: don't ruin my joke&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: *effort
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: my cat just fell asleep on me. i guess i'm stuck
 Astrobytes: I'm cat free for now, as I'm upstairs and  the window is open wide (they cannot be trusted except on the ground floor)
 Astrobytes: My old cat Phoebe, she fell out a 5 storey flat, landed on her feet. Was fine. Pretty sure she lost several lives though.
 AntiSquid: maybe cat jumping is still better than cat shoving a poker up its nostril
 AntiSquid: nvm that guy is gone
 Astrobytes: Cats are exceptionally good at falling.
 Astrobytes: We're not.
 AntiSquid: bungee jumping
 Astrobytes: *free-falling
 Astrobytes: **without a parachute etc
 AntiSquid: cats would do it too if they could
 Astrobytes: Bungee jumping? :P
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: Not sure either of my two would be impressed.
 AntiSquid: your cat would bungee jump down into a mouse and be back up to your flat before you even noticed
 Astrobytes: That's almost as bad as imagining the little beasts had wings.
 AntiSquid: the mice&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, the cats. That would essentially be a small bat otherwise.
 AntiSquid: one day ...
 AntiSquid: genetic engineering isn't there yet
 Astrobytes: I miss bats. Used to be loads where I lived when I worked in London.
 AntiSquid: winged cats and neko girls
 Astrobytes: You really do have something anime/manga related for almost every topic eh?
 AntiSquid: no
 wlesavo: yeah, it works ok, its just this particular one had grammar mistakes together with some slang/obscene words, not an easy task for sure eulerscheZahl 
 AntiSquid: just remembered the Elon Musk tweets regarding cat girls Astrobytes 
 Astrobytes: Not aware of those AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: thought it's funny he even considered entertaining that discussion
 Astrobytes: Guy's a bit of a loon
 eulerscheZahl: aren't swaer words the first you usually learn in a foreign language?
 eulerscheZahl: i can insult indians
 Astrobytes: ceg better watch out
 Astrobytes: *CG ceg, not the actual place
 eulerscheZahl: his name is prakash actually
 Astrobytes: I am fully aware of that
 Astrobytes: I even know his surname
 eulerscheZahl: i don't
 Astrobytes: But I won't divulge it
 AntiSquid: i think i saw it too 
 Astrobytes: (sent me a music playlist)
 AntiSquid: he even wrote in chat if i remember correctly
 eulerscheZahl: on the stream?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Astrobytes: I'm partial to some Indian music now and then, the rhythms and melodies are very interesting
 AntiSquid: no
 eulerscheZahl: i know squiddys full nameand doxxed myself on 2 or 3 occasions as well
 Astrobytes: Yes I know both of yours
 AntiSquid: don't care
 AntiSquid: about other people's names i mean
 eulerscheZahl: while the only thing i know about you is the garcia tshirt fro your profile pic Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol, yes, Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead fame
 Astrobytes: And we know Madeleine's name too
 eulerscheZahl: true
 AntiSquid: lol
 Astrobytes: But like squid said, I don't give a crap
 AntiSquid: Hasegawa Taizou 
 Astrobytes: that's your Madao (sp?) thing right?
 AntiSquid: no that's his real name duh
 Astrobytes: No, his real name is Madeleine Anton Kuz-something
 Nerchio: hey do you guys know a way to run cgbenchmark on a multi
 Nerchio: since it is the same name it says it's too late to run it
 AntiSquid: yes 
 AntiSquid: what do you mean too late?
 Nerchio: Error "it's too late to connect to the challenge"
 AntiSquid: ping neu man, he is your best bud anyway, will be delighted to help
 eulerscheZahl: enter the multiplayer name
 Astrobytes: Yea, you need to point it to the multi rather than the challenge
 Astrobytes: curse you euler
 eulerscheZahl: go to multiplayer, play once to find out how it's called
 Nerchio: spring-challenge-2020 is the same as was the challenge
 eulerscheZahl: which game do you want to play?
 Nerchio: the pacman :P
 Astrobytes: Global Thermonuclear War?
 Nerchio: it's in puzzles :s puzzle/spring-challenge-2020
 Astrobytes: How about a nice game of chess?
 eulerscheZahl: for me it seems to be 28526532f66f2180b933fe1def6e05c0283ddb6a
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/z3OSbjj">https://imgur.com/a/z3OSbjj</a>
 eulerscheZahl: whoops, forgot to trim the edge after moving
 jrke: hey i wanna know that in CSB that our pod will rotate and then move or first move and then rotate
 Nerchio: what's this?
 eulerscheZahl: network traffic. play your code in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: then analyze the request you sent
 Nerchio: I will try but I think there is a problem since
 Astrobytes: what kind of problem?
 Nerchio: when you pick pacman it says multiplayer/spring-challenge-2020 and when you are in ide
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not using CG Benchmark. But I suppose you need that number to play a battle with CG benchmark
 Nerchio: pacman is in puzzles
 Nerchio: . /ide/puzzle/spring-challenge-2020
 eulerscheZahl: did you check the red frame i drew on the right?
 wlesavo: Nerchio did you check isContest: false?
 AntiSquid: you don't need any number for cgbench 
 AntiSquid: i didn't need
 AntiSquid: wlesavo got it&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Ahhh
 AntiSquid: i remember that was the issue for me too
 Astrobytes: Been a while since I used bench
 Nerchio: wlesavo brilliant man :D
 jrke: plz ans this
 jrke: hey i wanna know that in CSB that our pod will rotate and then move or first move and then rotate
 eulerscheZahl: and then play the other pacman
 Nerchio: is the other pac online?
 Nerchio: i thought they took it down
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but i don't want to spoil
 tomatoes: rotate first iirc
 eulerscheZahl: not in the multiplayer section
 Nerchio: thanks @wlesavo it works not was a simple fix :D
 AntiSquid: what? who uploaded it 
 eulerscheZahl: not *that* pacman
 Astrobytes: jrke - you are in Legend league CSB, and you don't know whether the pod rotates before it moves?
 AntiSquid: then what other pacman&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: i only know 2 multis related to pacman
 jrke: i was confused at the moment
 eulerscheZahl: spoiler alert
 jrke: it just clicked my mind thanks Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: You know that other one AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: I see jrke
 Nerchio: euler you don't use cgbenchmark you use brutal tester? :P
 jrke: ya
 eulerscheZahl: neither
 Nerchio: your own sophisticated software? :D
 wlesavo: im intrigued about eulers pacman now
 eulerscheZahl: i play offline against myself (without brutaltester, just modifying the main class of the official referee)
 wlesavo: optim pac
 eulerscheZahl: and then i submit
 eulerscheZahl: advanced testing :D
 Nerchio: wtf
 Nerchio: i put optim pac in the search
 wlesavo: just setting player1 and player2?
 Nerchio: interesting 1st puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/09/02/urinal-protocol-vulnerability/">https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/09/02/urinal-protocol-vulnerability/</a>
 wlesavo: Nerchio :grinning:
 wlesavo: optimal urinal problem seems fun
 Nerchio: I'm pretty sure AntiSquid already solved it
 AntiSquid: i did
 AntiSquid: i go to the closed toilet areas instead
 AntiSquid: and piss on the seat 
 AntiSquid: easy win
 Tiramon: damn had to disable the timeout in my local referee to train my net ... was wondering why my bot failed to learn and he was timing out ...
 wlesavo: that problem statement is brilliant
 eulerscheZahl: Tiramon how did you disable it? or just increase?
 wlesavo: Tiramon wouldnt you exceed total gametime limit?
 Tiramon: i had to change GameRunner anyway to give my net feedback if it won or not and i just addednextPlayerInfo.timeout += 100000;
 eulerscheZahl: you know about the GameResult, right?
 tomatoes: full game limited to 30 secs
 Tiramon: i know the class yes ... why?
 Tiramon: you mean because it mentions timeout
 eulerscheZahl: GameResult game = gameRunner.simulate();
 Tiramon: but i disabled all output to get a readable log about the learning
 eulerscheZahl: won't solve your time issue
 eulerscheZahl: if you need all logs, that would require json parsing i think
 Tiramon: are the agents still connected at that point?
 AntiSquid: shit ... ate icecream too fast
 eulerscheZahl: brain freeze?
 eulerscheZahl: that GameResult is after the match ended
 Tiramon: then it would not fit in my current solution
 Tiramon: currently i send extra information to the agents
 eulerscheZahl: i guess it would be easier to fully integrate the referee + bots into a single program then
 Tiramon: maybe
 eulerscheZahl: at least removes the overhead of process communication
 AntiSquid: if you do self learning yes
 eulerscheZahl: which takes a lot of time
 AntiSquid: self play 
 Tiramon: normally i have a game of oware in 500ms, currently with PER it takes up to 1.2s
 Quidome: I am working on depot organization, which is hex-based. Are there hex-resource for algrithmic tricks?
 Tiramon: hm think PER is working ... got only 7% invalid actions currently
 Tiramon: before i didn't get it below 15%
 AntiSquid: what is PER&#160;?
 Astrobytes: With the PER, do you set the weights higher for the samples with timeouts and find a strategy to overcome it or do you set it lower to ignore those samples? (I'm very far from experienced)
 Tiramon: AntiSquid <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952">https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952</a>
 Astrobytes: Prioritised experience replays AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: *timeouts = invalid moves, sorry
 Tiramon: i don't manipulate the weights based on invalid moves
 Tiramon: i give a bad reward for invalid moves
 Tiramon: the bad weights will probably result in a big delta so there is a high chance he will try to learn from that step
 Astrobytes: Yeah I meant the reward, not the actual weights, my bad. Cool.
 Astrobytes: Very interesting, I didn't know about it until you mentioned it earlier,
 Tiramon: my rewards are score + win = 100loss = -100invalid -1000
 Tiramon: i'm currently taking the free month at udacity
 Tiramon: and do the deep reinforment learning nano degree
 Tiramon: quite nice
 Tiramon: and i wanted to try it on a cg game&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Nice. And putting it to good use ofc&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 eulerscheZahl: what do you need for that free month? just an email address?
 Astrobytes: Preferably a burnable email address at that
 AntiSquid: not sure i remember correctly but last time i wanted to go for a nanodegree thingy the price tag was about 400$ and i can be stingy at times
 eulerscheZahl: of course. 10minutemail ftw
 Tiramon: not sure what i entered, currently talking to my boss that he pays the other month
 Astrobytes: haha nice
 Tiramon: yes about 300-400 per month
 AntiSquid: it's 4 months rights?
 Tiramon: drlnd hast material for around 3 month
 Tiramon: ah 4 right
 Tiramon: but if you spent some time and have an idea of what you are doing i guess you can do it in less
 eulerscheZahl: and what are the chances for you boss to pay? you don't need it for your daily work
 Tiramon: im in for ... 1 or 2 weeks and just finished the first of three projects
 eulerscheZahl: but always good to have motivated employees
 AntiSquid: ya i imagined i could just do it elsewhere for free
 AntiSquid: no idea how good the course is
 Tiramon: we 'maybe' want to do some ML in the future and 
 Tiramon: he didn't say no when i asked him&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Get 1-to-1 (socially distanced) lessons from inory y AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: don't want to think about the fees, he lives in London no? he'll think of new ways to pay the rent
 Astrobytes: Get him to travel to Oxford and that's his payment, maybe a coffee and some noodles or sth :D
 AntiSquid: the 1 £ one from co-op
 Astrobytes: ASDA ones are cheaper
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: idk i tried the coop one and it's shit
 AntiSquid: are the asda ones even worse?
 Astrobytes: I think that's universal
 Astrobytes: Been a while since I used coop so... probably just the same tbh
 AntiSquid: really? korean / chinese instant noodles can be decent and even good sometimes 
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, lived in Tooting for a while when I was in London, massive Asian supermarkets, market. 
 Astrobytes: Chilli sauce for like 5p a bottle and shit
 Astrobytes: Was unreal
 Astrobytes: That was around 2004-5 tho'
 AntiSquid: ok that's just stupid on their behalf
 Astrobytes: No. The local Asian and Indian population was *immense*. Places were permanently rammed.
 tahsin314: Trump sucks!
 Astrobytes: Thank you for your valuable contribution to the conversation tahsin314
 tahsin314: LOL this was a valuable contribution :joy:
 AntiSquid: just ignore it Astrobytes, don't even acknowledge that thing's existence
 eulerscheZahl: Trump got fact-checked by twitter :D
 Astrobytes: Saw that eulerscheZahl :D
 MSmits: It's great
 MSmits: so humiliating to have a fact check below your lies
 Astrobytes: His response is somewhat disturbing however
 MSmits: disturbing is normal for him
 AntiSquid: he is weird
 Astrobytes: One may even say, fascist
 AntiSquid: in a bad way
 MSmits: I thought it was ridiculous Twitter let him do what he did before. They ban anyone else who trolls that much
 AntiSquid: but bush got a second mandate so kinda expect trump to still get one too
 MSmits: if he does, they deserve it
 MSmits: well, half of them do
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't side with big social media platforms
 AntiSquid: two wrongs don't make one right
 MSmits: I'm not on any of them thankfully
 eulerscheZahl: CodinGame is my social media platform
 MSmits: yeah mine too
 eulerscheZahl: and discord which i joined because of CG
 AntiSquid: just the other day i saw David Icke getting banned on youtube, i mean he is clearly insane, so why ban him?
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea who that is
 MSmits: I know Vincent Icke, related?
 AntiSquid: someone taking the movie "They Live" way too seriously
 MSmits: Who live?
 AntiSquid: the movie is closer to reality than what that guy says
 Astrobytes: Lizard-people guy, thinly-veiled Anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist. 
 eulerscheZahl: I know the Berlin dialect Icke (means ich = I/me)
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJC4R1uXDaE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJC4R1uXDaE</a> MSmits
 AntiSquid: i don't get where that anti-semitic bit came from, isn't he always moaning about banksters (and ya many are part jewish)
 Astrobytes: And pronounced like Ike as in bike eulerscheZahl, as opposed to a Berlin-style Ich
 MSmits: that must have been a horrible movie
 AntiSquid: i mean icke basically "predicts" there are corrupt elites / super rich / people in power ... and duh he is right about something lol
 MSmits: some of the worst acting i ever saw
 AntiSquid: MSmits the movie is great, it's old, but great movie
 MSmits: really...
 AntiSquid: just don't take it literally
 MSmits: wasn't terminator made around the same time
 MSmits:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: don't judge a book by its cover?
 MSmits: some cover...
 MSmits: the trailer is supposed to show the good bits :P
 Astrobytes: He just takes common problems and comes up with conspiracies involving elites and lizard-people (i.e. Jews and whatnot), and people identify with the problems he identifies because they seek solutions. Populist conspiracy theorist.
 Astrobytes: Makes a shit-ton of money too,
 Astrobytes: Oddly enough
 eulerscheZahl: oh, like kyle's brother from Southpark @Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Yes eulerscheZahl, just like baby Ike
 MSmits: isn't he canadian?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWQO3BChV1w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWQO3BChV1w</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, 'They Live', awesome
 Thiesjoo: What exactly is the difference between vector and array in c++? (Just starting to learn)
 Astrobytes: haha euler
 MSmits: vector is always on heap Thiesjoo
 MSmits: mmh you dont know what heap is
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, that's why he has that detached head/mouth thingy
 Thiesjoo: No not really, MSmits
 Astrobytes: *the heap
 AntiSquid: the difference is basically array is fixed size, vector is resizable
 Astrobytes: as opposed to *a* heap
 AntiSquid: imo most important difference
 AbundantPuddle: Just read your last message Astro, and I'm going to assume you're talking about David Icke?
 MSmits: it's not that easy to explain, but there's stack memory and heap memory. If you have a small array, it will often be on stack, which is faster memory. Vector will be somewhat slower, but has lots of pro's, like resizability as AntiSquid said
 Thiesjoo: Ah ok, so use vectors for resizeability
 Thiesjoo: And array's for fixed things
 Astrobytes: Yes LargeAmountsOfAccumulatedLiquidInALimitedArea
 MSmits: stack and heap are mostly conceptual and what happens under the hood might be different from what i just said... dont worry too much about it
 AntiSquid: he said he started ... you don't give a shit about heap and stack when you just start
 AntiSquid: you look for the tools to get shit done
 MSmits: I know
 AntiSquid: that's it
 AbundantPuddle: Dude  is a nut. Did you ever see the interview with him where he claimed to be Jesus?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that was his 'transition' moment.
 Astrobytes: Very rich nut.
 MSmits: Thiesjoo why are you learning c++ btw?
 Scarfield: I think im happy i dont know who this Icke is
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid Thiesjoo is MSmits student
 AntiSquid: c++ is good keep at it Thiesjoo
 Thiesjoo: MSmits, i don't really know. Javascript was a bit boring
 Thiesjoo: Wanted to do some faster stuff
 MSmits: yeah it's great, but can also be very frustrating at first
 Astrobytes: I like your thinking there Thiesjoo&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: C++ has it's catches, i noticed that already
 AbundantPuddle: Oh for sure. The internet has laid waste to common sense and given people like that a platform to seriously spread crazy idealogy.
 AntiSquid: what? hope you not gonna say typescript is cool next
 MSmits: many things you can do in a few lines in python or a few more lines in C#/java, takes a LOT of code in c++
 MSmits: and you're less protected from hard to find bugs
 eulerscheZahl: but for now it's time to learn Kotlin
 MSmits: but it's a good challenge indeed
 Thiesjoo: I worked a good bit with c# in unity(Game dev)
 Astrobytes: Definitely AbundantPuddle, and the crazier the world gets, the more crazy theories people look to for an explanation as to why things are going to s**t
 AbundantPuddle: Agreed 100%
 MSmits: well... eulerscheZahl almost always uses C# and he's nr 1 on this site
 AntiSquid: AbundantPuddle what's the real issue? someone spewing nonsense or a bunch of people acting on it and doing stupid things?
 Astrobytes: Stick with C# for now then Thiesjoo
 AntiSquid: + the censorship 
 Thiesjoo: Mmmhhh, i think i will go over to c#
 Astrobytes: (not treading on your toes here I hope MSmits)
 Thiesjoo: c++ is a bit too hard for now
 Thiesjoo: Maybe in a year or 2
 MSmits: c++ can be 2-3 times faster than C#, but it's very rarely the case that this decisive
 AntiSquid: i don't think social media should be allowed to practice any form of politics
 AbundantPuddle: The latter, obviously. It's just a shame that so many people can fall for some of this nonsense to begin with. And then they claim to be "woke."
 MSmits: euler can usually have a somewhat better algorithm than most players and beat them, even if they use C++
 AntiSquid: yes but banning nutjubs isn't the cure
 MSmits: the exception would be simple board games, where you need little code to make a bot
 AntiSquid: nutjobs *
 MSmits: then speed might be an issue
 MSmits: (like uttt)
 eulerscheZahl: for bulls and cows i saw myself forced to go with C++but as smits said: rare occasion
 AbundantPuddle: I think I like nutjubs better. Can we adopt that as the new terminology?
 Thiesjoo: I just did Pikaptcha ep1 with c++, but ep2 is a bit harder, so trying that now with c#
 eulerscheZahl: usually the smart algo beats the faster implementation of something worse
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: Thiesjoo, thats pretty cool, doing that with c++
 MSmits: I did the contest version of pikachu in C# myself
 MSmits: same puzzles
 Thiesjoo: Yeah, got a bunch of achievements for that.
 Astrobytes: Keep learning some C++ on the side though if you feel like it
 Thiesjoo: Saw a bunch of people talking about it on Discord, so i taught i would join the fun
 Astrobytes: Take your time
 Thiesjoo: Will do
 MSmits: btw, my first C++ bot, was a C# bot converted to c++ 
 MSmits: I got to legend in uttt with C# and then switched
 AntiSquid: c++ isn't hard, just need to get used to the syntax
 AntiSquid: java takes more time to get used to imo
 Thiesjoo: syntax seemed pretty similiar to javascript.
 MSmits: you also need to get used to the concept of pointers and refeences
 MSmits: thats much harder to learn than the syntax
 MSmits: because other languages dont have that
 MSmits: well references they do, but not explicit like in C++
 AntiSquid: you can leave pointers out when you start :p
 Thiesjoo: Javascript assumes it for you, which sometimes causes very stupid bugs
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of languages are influenced by C and thus look similar at first. but there are fundamental differences, the deeper you dive inside
 MSmits: yes javascript is hard in its own way, python too 
 Tiramon: i slowly get used to python currently&#160;;)
 MSmits: smaller programs where speed isnt important should be done in python
 AntiSquid: those are the easiest languages imo :p
 MSmits: or java/C# if you're good with it
 AntiSquid: especially python 
 Thiesjoo: I made a maze solver/generator in python, so i have the code for Pikaptcha ep2
 Thiesjoo: Now converting it to c#
 MSmits: whats ep2 again?
 AbundantPuddle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5b57325-be56-4042-a110-9f7943bb6291">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5b57325-be56-4042-a110-9f7943bb6291</a>
 MSmits: a wrapping maze?
 Thiesjoo: Maze solver that follows the wall
 eulerscheZahl: normal maze
 eulerscheZahl: ep1 = neighbor counting
 MSmits: ohhh ok
 eulerscheZahl: till then the contest was going great for me
 AntiSquid: 3 is wrapping (fake mobius strip)
 MSmits: yeah like 15 mins for episode 1 and 2? And then an hour for episode 3?
 eulerscheZahl: and then the fake Möbius happened
 MSmits: for the Mobius you should just reverse engineer the testcase
 MSmits: unless they fixed the description
 AntiSquid: no he didn't
 MSmits: the description only confused me
 AntiSquid: that's where you pull a ceg and ask questions in chat or watch replays, don't even look at statement
 Astrobytes: Does your CS teaching cover architecture, memory, pointers MSmits?
 MSmits: I have not done that much CS this year Astrobytes, just 4 hrs a week
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 MSmits: but pretty sure it doesnt cover pointers, it will cover architecture and memory I think
 MSmits: my colleague did most (15 hrs a week)
 Astrobytes: Pointers will come naturally after understanding memory and architecture
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: most of my classes were about python and algorithms
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 MSmits: I am considering doing a project on teaching machine learning next year
 AntiSquid: "not that much CS"reminds me of how after 3 years of 1 hour / week we finally did heap/queues/binary tree searches and lots of other basic stuff in the "IT" class
 MSmits: so we might add that to Thiesjoo's curriculum
 Thiesjoo: Seems cool
 AntiSquid: (this was in highschool)
 MSmits: I have to do it for my studies
 Astrobytes: It is Thiesjoo&#160;:)
 MSmits: some project
 Astrobytes: Never did anything like that when I was in highschool AntiSquid, I knew more than my 'Computing' teacher :D
 MSmits: Thiesjoo it's not certain, might be I end up doing it in a lower year
 MSmits: but last year seems more natural
 AntiSquid: glad we studied 5 hours a week literature in one language and 5 in another
 Tiramon: ok i guess after the current training i send my new weights to cg and try to beat this stupid invalid actions
 Astrobytes: Best of luck Tiramon&#160;:)
 MSmits: AntiSquid you seem quite literate though
 MSmits: so good job on that
 AntiSquid: i don't use those languages in my daily life
 MSmits: yeah, I'm glad I could drop most languages in the last 2 years of my high school
 Astrobytes: Which languages?
 MSmits: just Dutch and English for me
 AntiSquid: romanian/german 
 Thiesjoo: And i have to deal with german?!
 MSmits: yes Thiesjoo, sorry
 Thiesjoo: Unfair MSmits
 MSmits: I agree it is
 AntiSquid: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i have to deal with German too
 Astrobytes: Hey I always enjoyed German back in school
 AntiSquid: write your variable names in german Thiesjoo
 Thiesjoo: I don't think that would be nice AntiSquid. English for me please
 MSmits: the years after I was done with high school, my country decided that students like Thiesjoo need to learn either German or French
 AntiSquid: well once you done your coding part just replace variable names Thiesjoo
 Astrobytes: That's the only choice we had MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: for us it was French or Latin
 Tiramon: what for AntiSquid? low level obfuscating?
 MSmits: ah some do Latin here as well, but very few
 AntiSquid: obfuscation is a side effect
 Astrobytes: Whereas, my uncle for instance - at the same highschool - learned Latin, Greek and Ancient Greek
 AntiSquid: make the code annoying to read
 Astrobytes: How times change
 eulerscheZahl: and when I finished school I was lucky that our Minister of defense decided to pause military duty \o/
 Astrobytes: Very lucky.
 AntiSquid: i think that was related to the EU
 eulerscheZahl: soon after he had to resign as he cheated on his PhD
 MSmits: you mean the draft?
 Astrobytes: Yea
 eulerscheZahl: as in: copy-pasted most of it :D
 MSmits: wow
 Astrobytes: lol that's brilliant
 Astrobytes: Not for him I guess
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GuttenPlag_Wiki">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GuttenPlag_Wiki</a>
 AntiSquid: what gave it away?
 eulerscheZahl: the barcode indicated copying without cites
 AntiSquid: reminds me of a certain head of IT that got a jail sentence because he lied he had a degree in CS 
 AbundantPuddle: I code in Klingon
 AntiSquid: not gonna say which company
 AntiSquid: you can guess
 Astrobytes: "At least 21.5% of his dissertation consists of plagiarism" - :o
 AbundantPuddle: and use nested infinite loops
 eulerscheZahl: quite an achievement to pass on the first run with it
 MSmits: maybe he should only have been 78.5% fired?
 AntiSquid: so basically you don't even need to get the phd some times
 MSmits: wait that doesnt make sense, 
 MSmits: 21.5% it is
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid Peter Knight?
 Astrobytes: That's a f***ing lot of plagiarism!
 MSmits: I have had students that did more, but I guess they aren't ministers
 eulerscheZahl: and after that some other PhDs of politicians were examined
 eulerscheZahl: and others had to resign as well :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 AbundantPuddle: It's like he didn't even try. He must have literally just copied and pasted.
 MSmits: it's pretty hard to steal a PhD in physics
 AntiSquid: did they get sued for it euler
 MSmits: it's gonna get noticed more easily
 AntiSquid: also yes euler
 Astrobytes: It's easy to get qualifications if you are privileged enough to have the right contacts in the right places
 eulerscheZahl: i claim the google power user badge then&#160;:)
 MSmits: people in social sciences write so much, that noone is going to read most of it anyway :P
 AntiSquid: was obv you used that lol 
 AbundantPuddle: Now was this the Minister of Defense that you guys are talking about?
 eulerscheZahl: the guy with the many first names
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Theodor_zu_Guttenberg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Theodor_zu_Guttenberg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Buhl-Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg
 AbundantPuddle: Just googled it. Lol.
 Astrobytes: Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester Buhl-Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg
 MSmits: Did he plagiarize other people's names as well?
 Astrobytes: OH DAMN you euler
 eulerscheZahl: when he got the job, someone added an extra first name to his wikipedia page
 MSmits: I bet noone noticed :P
 eulerscheZahl: was only there for a short time but some news reporter copied the name from that wiki article :D
 AbundantPuddle: [...] he may have made errors in his footnotes. Lmao.
 eulerscheZahl: then it was printed, so it has to be correct, right?so wikipedia added the wrong extra name again
 eulerscheZahl: and when his cheating became obvious, someone added the name Xerox to the list
 MSmits: I had a colleague once that edited a wiki about submarines and just changed some type numbers. Noone notices this. That's why you need to be careful
 Astrobytes: LOL
 Astrobytes: Xerox
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Batuta_hoax">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henryk_Batuta_hoax</a>
 Astrobytes: "Noone notices this" - except people who fact-check their wikipedia info&#160;;)Which one must always do.
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: I've used Wikipedia for references in a few courses, but you have to do some real detective work and know wtf you're on about
 Astrobytes: *referenced Wikipedia
 AntiSquid: i think this still pales in comparison to Kim Jung-Un's self created image
 AbundantPuddle: Is his name really Guttenberg? Or is that just a play at Gutenberg?
 Astrobytes: It's sometimes better just to reference the citated reference though
 AntiSquid: the guy walked out of his mom's place when he was 20, not her flat ... 
 Astrobytes: *cited, where did I get citated from?
 AbundantPuddle: Lmao
 AbundantPuddle: "citated" sounds dirty.
 Astrobytes: Only in your mind CopiusFloodedArea
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: I citated the hell out of that paper.
 AntiSquid: citatrix 
 Astrobytes: domicitrix, she who citates the most
 Astrobytes: *domicitatrix, w/e
 Stanworld: in  a bots challenge, what s happens if i submit 2 times in 10sec by misclick&#160;?
 MSmits: it just restarts
 Astrobytes: You submit 2 times
 MSmits: doesnt matter
 AntiSquid: you need to submit more frequently to unlock the minigame Stanworld
 Astrobytes: Keep doing that though and you'll reach a submit limit
 MSmits: if you do it too often, then the server thinks you're a bot and you'll be studying traffic lights
 Stanworld: AntiSquid, are you telling there is a eastern egg&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: yes Stanworld, if you think the bot game is hard, try identifying the traffic lights
 Astrobytes: Lies. He tells you lies STanworld
 AntiSquid: a very fun one, helps you check how much your resemble a real bot Stanworld
 Stanworld:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Isn't that related to the ANEO puzzle MSmits
 MSmits: hmm dont remember. I am sure I solved it
 MSmits: it said i could apply for a job at the end right/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The speed/traddic light one
 Astrobytes: *traffic ffs
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 AntiSquid: ya MSmits but it was for specific country
 Stanworld: i watched 'ready player one" some days before start 'spring challenge 2020"
 MSmits: it was ok
 Astrobytes: Did it inspire you?
 Astrobytes: I haven't seen it tbh
 MSmits: better than They live
 Stanworld: about old fashion game, and the very first easter egg... kind of inspirating
 Astrobytes: You've not seen 'They Live'
 AbundantPuddle: I always found those captchas discriminatory.
 AntiSquid: the cover art kinda reminds of the movie player one, but it's nothing like the movie 
 MSmits: dont need to Astrobytes
 MSmits: I judged the cover
 AntiSquid: i had the book at some point
 Astrobytes: MSmits it's actually really good
 AntiSquid: there's a bunch of books detailing people's adventure in online games
 MSmits: are you saying it's not like a sharknado movie?
 Astrobytes: It's not like a Sharknado movie
 AntiSquid: MSmits what movies did you watch and enjoyed? curious
 MSmits: not even sharknado 2?
 Astrobytes: It's actually pretty relevant
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: many
 MSmits: name a genre?
 AntiSquid: MSmits i mean a movie title
 MSmits: oh
 Astrobytes: pornogr... I mean sci-fi
 MSmits: Tremors!
 Stanworld: i diminush the limit of 'deep' my diffuse algorithm can go, to avoid some timeout, seems to work , and climlbing in the ladder, slowly and ...not so surely 
 AbundantPuddle: Camp Cuddly Pines Power Tool  Massacre
 MSmits: Tremors is an awesome classic
 Astrobytes: Yes
 AntiSquid: also "They Live" is about as educational as animal farm or 1984
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm not doing this 2 nights in a row
 Astrobytes: BTTC
 MSmits: back to the code?
 MSmits: making squares with a snake?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, should be BTMC
 Stanworld: seem very "random" how my rank vary during the submit , i can gain 100 ranks and lost 300 just after some seconds...
 Astrobytes: (BAck to my code)
 MSmits: back too monte carlo?
 MSmits: oh
 AntiSquid: MSmits tremors looks like a bad old horror movie
 MSmits: Stanworld that can mean several things
 Tiramon: Stanworld it's Trueskill algo
 MSmits: sometimes it means the bots are all pretty close together
 MSmits: sometimes it means there's strong rock paper scissors effects and you're unlucky with opponents
 Astrobytes: You've never seen Tremors AntiSquid? :o
 MSmits: AntiSquid it might be like they live and you had to have seen it at the time it was made
 Astrobytes: (I'm breaking my rule here)
 AntiSquid: reminds me ofThe Langoliers or whatever it was called, just by looking at it
 MSmits: but it is pretty cool
 Astrobytes: No, They Live is also worth watching MSmits, really
 Stanworld: well , i used to love "random" in my algorithms as a reference bot to beat before submit, but now i swear there are very few random in my last submit
 MSmits: tremors  &gt; langoliers, but langoliers was ok
 AntiSquid: MSmits They Live is timeless
 AntiSquid: there's an important message in the movie
 MSmits: and RockyMullet is in it
 AntiSquid: hah
 tomatoes: hate random 
 Astrobytes: As Squid said, like 1984 or Animal Farm, that kinda thing
 Tiramon: The Court Jester is a timeless  one&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: have you seen Donnie Drako&#160;?
 MSmits: donnie darko is very good
 MSmits: one of my favorite movies
 AntiSquid: darko*
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: like the song too
 AntiSquid: ok so maybe you don't have bad taste :p
 Astrobytes: Also a great movie
 MSmits: did you see Memento AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: not sure
 AntiSquid: rings a bell
 MSmits: guy with a 15 min memory, movie is in reverse
 Tiramon: memento is fun
 MSmits: so you know as much as he does
 MSmits: the scenes are in reverse i mean
 MSmits: not the action
 MSmits: reverse order
 AntiSquid: i don't know if i've seen that or not ... sounds so damn familiar
 Stanworld: i loved memento
 Stanworld: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/270/">https://xkcd.com/270/</a>
 Tiramon: damn should have added an eta to my training script ...
 Stanworld: memento referenced by xkcd
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure xkcd has every subject covered :D
 eulerscheZahl: is there an xkcd about xkcd covering everything?
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: Well, you got me there. I will go with 'possibly'
 Stanworld: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/927/">https://xkcd.com/927/</a>
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://relevantxkcd.appspot.com/">https://relevantxkcd.appspot.com/</a>
 Stanworld: there are standards to cover...
 Astrobytes: jacek no, when I try to find an xkcd about xkcd covering every subject I get a 2.66% relevant xkcd
 eulerscheZahl: there's always a relevant xkcd gives #1079
 eulerscheZahl: not a match either
 Astrobytes: I can't get anything relevant
 Astrobytes: Perhaps we need to contact them
 Astrobytes: It's bed time for you eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: home office screwed up my sleeping habits
 JBM: hear, hear
 Astrobytes: We noticed :D
 eulerscheZahl: i even miss some of my colleagues
 Astrobytes: Wow. Lockdown is really getting to you
 eulerscheZahl: not the ones who run against the door when opening it and scaring me
 eulerscheZahl: my desk is next to a really loud door
 Astrobytes: Insensitive w**kers
 AbundantPuddle: 0.08333333333333333&#160;!= 0.08333333333333334
 Astrobytes: don't compare floats/doubles like that
 eulerscheZahl: another colleague got my desk (distancing) now. first this he did was to put a paper on the door "no entrance"
 eulerscheZahl: he was one of those how annoyed me before
 AbundantPuddle: Don't tell me what to do.
 AbundantPuddle: :joy:
 Astrobytes: Those kind of people annoy me greatly in offices eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: and we had one, when he was on the phone he talked so loud that everyone (about 50 people) could hear him
 AbundantPuddle: On a big enough scale, though, that little bit does make a difference.
 eulerscheZahl: but he's retired now. was fun how unfriendly he was sometimes :D
 Stanworld: bedtime... good bye youngs ones
 AbundantPuddle: On a big enough scale, though, that little bit does make a difference.
 Astrobytes: Who you calling young Stanworld?
 AbundantPuddle: He said youngs, not young. I think it's an acronym for something derogatory.
 eulerscheZahl: lots of 30+ users here right now
 Astrobytes: We had issues like that in my last (and only :D ) dev job, Sales was through a tiny corridor from our Dev Cupboard. We had this guy who you could ALWAYS hear
 Astrobytes: And he had a really annoying voice
 Tiramon: someone like that is sitting right infront of me in the same room ...
 Astrobytes: Working late Tiramon?
 eulerscheZahl: HELLO! HELLO! CAN YOU HEAR ME? HELLO!i left office earlier the day he had an important call and couldn't connect
 Tiramon: no not right now ... at work
 Astrobytes: Ah right. It's SO distracting
 eulerscheZahl: my current desk in company is ok-ish (great compared to other desks)
 eulerscheZahl: about 7 people in a separated area
 eulerscheZahl: main office is about 50 persons
 eulerscheZahl: and then there's me who doesn't like social interaction and doesn't even want you to see my screen
 Astrobytes: slightly OT: eulerscheZahl, here's my last dev job's website:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010428070259/http://www.2webpages.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20010428070259/http://www.2webpages.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i remember that
 eulerscheZahl: you shared it one day, complaining about the colors used
 Astrobytes: Oh you saw that
 Astrobytes: yeah the #FF6600 orange
 eulerscheZahl: damn, i missed the PS2 competition:(
 Astrobytes: I so wish the original was available
 Astrobytes: If you look in the page source you can see my font class "weeoran" - meaning small orange (Scottish wee = small)
 Astrobytes: Getting all that crap to display properly in all browsers back then was a nightmare. Today's frontend guys don't know how good they have it
 eulerscheZahl: and we can just ignore internet explorer
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 DatTrinh: hello
 eulerscheZahl: to simplify further
 Astrobytes: Trying to get JS to work properly was just... omg. And JS itself then was... omg
 eulerscheZahl: and netspace navigator was the hottest shit
 eulerscheZahl: and altavista to search anything and get hlep
 Astrobytes: We switched from perl/MySQL to perl/XML/XSLT for that redesign
 Astrobytes: Altavista!
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait. you had your own search engine. use your own product
 DatTrinh: Hello
 Astrobytes: No it was a business search engine
 Astrobytes: It would have been successful but for greedy owners
 Astrobytes: *netscape navigator btw :P And don't get me started
 MSmits: I remember when altavista was google
 MSmits: well the google of its time
 Astrobytes: Yup
 Astrobytes: Google started getting good around 2000/2001 (in relative terms)
 Astrobytes: Btw, for the record, I strongly contested the use of that 'towpy' mascot on the aforementioned website
 MSmits: whats towpy?
 Astrobytes: scroll up and click the webarchive link
 Astrobytes: 'Towpy' is that native American stereotype cartoon face at the top of the page.
 Astrobytes: 'towp' was a domain name we had, so our amazingly creative Creative Director came up with 'Towpy' as an 'identifiable character for our brand'
 Astrobytes: You can probably tell why I gravitated towards backend dev
 AntiSquid: just watched tremors, i think it's shit
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6anTpADz6Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6anTpADz6Y</a>
 AntiSquid: needed the explanation
 AntiSquid: also reminds me of hellraiser, which was imo also extremely shit, sorry
 MSmits: you watched the entire movie just now?
 MSmits: hellraiser sounds like a completely different kind of movie though?
 Astrobytes: He watches on FF
 AntiSquid: i mean in terms of quality
 AntiSquid: just double speed
 Astrobytes: You cannot compare Hellraiser and Tremors
 AntiSquid: i mean they are equally bad
 MSmits: dont remember seeing hellraiser
 Astrobytes: The pinhead guy, Cenobites, the puzzlebox?
 AntiSquid: you can't compare the story and the theme no 
 AntiSquid: but if you watched those, how can you hate sharknado?
 MSmits: i just saw trailers of sharknado, maybe it's great
 AntiSquid:&#160;:(
 MSmits: i did see some tomato horror, seemed similar
 MSmits: attack of the killer tomatoes?
 MSmits: or something like that
 AntiSquid: ya
 tomatoes: :rolling_eyes:
 AntiSquid: you're just a salad tomato
 Astrobytes: I used Hellraiser samples for this shit tune back in the day:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hearthis.at/team174/4-astrocyte-tear-you-apart/">https://hearthis.at/team174/4-astrocyte-tear-you-apart/</a>
 Astrobytes: 'scuse the quality
 AntiSquid: btw i remember pinhead got turned into human and started whining about it, then in another movie on a space ship he was finally destroyed
 AntiSquid: or locked in his realm
 AntiSquid: how does that work lol
 AntiSquid: also since he was basically demoted from his manager position in torture realm, how did he get back in charge again?
 Astrobytes: Don't think I watched past the first one or two, just plundered for samples
 AntiSquid: ya it's really stupid
 AntiSquid: but that's how horror movies are
 Astrobytes: They just rinse the franchises for all they're worth
 Astrobytes: Flog the dead horse and all that
 JBM: ok the troll can speak
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes in one of the movies he messed with an angel, then he got turned into human as "punishment" then he moaned his pain is gone and movie ends LOL
 JBM: if there's any popular controversy you'd like mentioned, leave me a note
 Astrobytes: Sorry, just listening to my old tune, I quite like it besides the poor production
 AntiSquid: hm well quoting ceg's GAimax algo might be a bit too rude
 AntiSquid: JBM
 AntiSquid: (he actually ade up that name)
 JBM: i'm fine with cg lore
 JBM: just find a quick and balanced way to put it
 Astrobytes: Yeah cegimax/GAimax
 JBM: "GAimax"?
 AntiSquid: make the troll say at the start:Powered by true AI
 JBM: i've already got a sim vs heuristics
 AntiSquid: yes JBM, i call it gaymax
 JBM: i usually take them triplets
 JBM: one for "troll goes left", one "goes right", and one "grunts and doesn't move"
 Astrobytes: Well, he didn't know if he'd written a GA or a minimax. And then claimed it used a payoff matrix. Then it turned out it was a MC.
 JBM: so many people invented mc
 JBM: ok, let's say chokudai left, smitsmax right, and gaymax middle
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: don't type it as gaymax, might be edited then
 AntiSquid: write GAimax
 JBM: why so?
 AntiSquid: i would put "true AI" in middle
 JBM: all right
 Neumann: But, does it prune&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It's the fact I spent hours explaining minimax and a/b pruning to him, gave him half my eval function and a skeleton "solve" method... and he still came out with GAimax
 JBM: yeah, i'm still not sure why you spent the time
 AntiSquid: also write "SEARCHO NO CHOKUDAI"  (search of chokudai) to make it more aligned with the meme's origin
 JBM: does it have to be allcaps?
 AntiSquid: just my suggestions
 Astrobytes: I try to be helpful
 AntiSquid: make adjustments as you see fit, it's your game
 Neumann: Why trolling Chokudai&#160;? It's kind of a good idea. Better than Cegimax for sure
 JBM: AntiSquid: i meant, is it relevant?
 AntiSquid: not trolling, popularizing
 Astrobytes: For sure Neumann&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: shows enthusiasm JBM
 JBM: right
 AntiSquid: like BANZAI! 
 AntiSquid: YOKATA!
 JBM: right now they're mostly lowcaps
 Astrobytes: Something like "Should've used a Prune Array" when you lose would be cool
 JBM: the most capitalized one is "COME FROM FTW"
 JBM: closely folowed by "NPE &gt; SIGSEGV"
 JBM: i'm OOTL wrt the prune array
 AntiSquid: actually "True AI, no sim" would be more accurate than just true ai on it's on, if you do add that
 Astrobytes: ceg had an array of... some numbers, which he was using to prune moves in his ... um .... cegimax algo
 JBM: it's already in, and i'll improve
 Astrobytes: This was during the a/b pruning discussion 
 AntiSquid: ceg's complex algos sound like adding bugs back in after fixing a bot because it dropped in rank
 AntiSquid: no offense, it's just how i see it
 Astrobytes: ceg misunderstands the algos. A lot.
 Astrobytes: Because he won't read or pay attention long enough to get it.
 Astrobytes: JBM: Prune array<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/iaFvAsL">https://imgur.com/iaFvAsL</a>
 AntiSquid: should link him a few materials about the slime mold algo then, would like to see more creative stuff
 Astrobytes: I like ceg, he's not a bad guy at all, but I wish to hell he would just listen and take the time to learn
 Astrobytes: I'm not even a dev ffs
 Astrobytes: And I'm teaching him
 JBM: whereas all he wants/does is...?
 Astrobytes: The path of least resistance
 JBM: you got me to wonder what that e means
 Astrobytes: Then moans about the leaderboard when he doesn't rank as high as he expected
 JBM: yeah that part was memorable
 Astrobytes: tl;dr "the easy legend way"
 JBM: "i should rank higher than all those people who beat me"
 AntiSquid: but often people get legend and then notice a major bug they fix in legend so it's not far from the truth
 Astrobytes: Which 'e' JBM?
 JBM: the one after 500g
 AntiSquid: best example: MBits doing PCR, being at #2 and then fixing a bug "finally" and getting 1st
 MSmits: I did that?
 MSmits: why do people remember things I did better than me&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i remember your chat ramblings yes
 AntiSquid: because you write huge paragraphs about it
 MSmits: that's true
 AntiSquid: you SPAM the chat with that kind of stuff
 Astrobytes: Ah that's an indicator of 'average amount' JBM
 JBM: he does that to get it out of his system
 AntiSquid: hard to forget when there's a wall of text with just htat
 JBM: don't bring it back in!
 JBM: Astrobytes: TIL
 MSmits: oh, that's a good theory, it's out of my system and into AntiSquid's
 JBM: and i've seen those like all my life
 Astrobytes: At least MSmits's walls of text are usually worth reading
 JBM: as opposed to? :P
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nameless Individuals Who Post Walls Of Text
 MSmits: NiwPwot?
 JBM: i mean, we've got one or two overin #fr
 JBM: but here i'm not sure
 Astrobytes: But there's a difference between posting nonsense and sensible rubberducking/explanations
 MSmits: we had them before
 MSmits: i do a little less of it these days, but we had cyberpunk too
 JBM: rubberducking is always useful
 Astrobytes: 100%
 AntiSquid: in fact judging by the amounts of bugs described during your PCR journey, i guess ceg should get easy legend in most multis MSmits
 AntiSquid: if he implement gaymax correctly
 MSmits: by reading my bug reports?
 MSmits: you mean that cegimax?
 AntiSquid: he wrote GAimax 3 times
 MSmits: oh
 AntiSquid: or more
 MSmits: I'm not sure if this chat is good for you AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: why?
 AntiSquid: i am watching shitty movies in between
 MSmits: well you seem to lack a good filter and remember all the useless stuff as well :P
 AntiSquid: doesn't make much of a difference
 MSmits: memory overload
 Astrobytes: He didn't know if his algo was A GA, or a minimax, but he was convinced it had a payoff matrix, yet couldn't describe how he chose a move based on that MSmits
 AntiSquid: i remember a lot of useless shit from my childhood
 AntiSquid: even some kindergarten bits
 MSmits: they had bits in kindergarten??
 AntiSquid: but when it comes to stuff i really want to remember then i fail&#160;:(
 MSmits: I remember stuff from my kindergarten but it was mostly quarrels about who got to play with which toy
 MSmits: we didnt do any bitboards
 MSmits: mmh or maybe we did and I repressed it
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 MSmits: tbh it would explain a lot
 Astrobytes: Bet you were banned from playing board games with any of the other kids
 AntiSquid: i need to form better habits though it's true
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN i am leaving you, bye you filth, you mean nothing to me
 MSmits: I was really good at chess in primary school, but never played it after, so now i suck
 AutomatonNN: can't solve the puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: Doesn't take long to get up to speed again MSmits, but all the openings and endings... meh. Better with Fischer Random
 AntiSquid: i beat my chemistry teacher in chess, supposedly one of the best MSmits
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: one of my colleagues is a chemistry teacher and a good chess player
 MSmits: he did speed-chess against a bunch of students at once
 Astrobytes: AT least Fischer Random is actually about playing chess. Not just opening/ending books
 AntiSquid: just watch magnus carlsen and realize you don't want to learn chess, you want to live life not become a human chess bot
 MSmits: thats what he likes
 Astrobytes: I went off chess because of the robotic memorisation aspect
 MSmits: the sad thing about being that good is that you can't stop or you'll stop being the best
 MSmits: so you get a very monotonous life
 MSmits: I mean, at least play a different game every once in a while
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah i dont like the memorization either
 Astrobytes: TRy Fischer Random
 Astrobytes: really
 MSmits: I prefer simpler games
 MSmits: less different types of pieces and such
 Astrobytes: It's random starting positions, invented by the one and only Bobby Fischer
 AntiSquid: might even be the choice between a monotonous life and being a nobody though
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: oh, I finally got my grade for my internet security class
 AntiSquid: anyone good at parsing CG replays btw&#160;?
 MSmits: 10/10&#160;!
 MSmits: AntiSquid euler
 AntiSquid: he linked me the CG encoder i think
 MSmits: gotta wait for him to wake up
 AntiSquid: and it looked like lots of headaches
 MSmits: it's definitely a nice skill to have on CG
 Astrobytes: gz MSmits
 Astrobytes: What about his tech.io playground AntiSquid?
 MSmits: thanks... i didnt even like the subject much, but I just did the homework. Some of you guys helped me a few times btw.
 MSmits: euler, counterbalance etc.
 Astrobytes: yeah I remember your nmap fun
 MSmits: yeah that
 AntiSquid: he made one that explains replay parsing&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i only remember the basic replay download bit
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/the-codingame-api">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/the-codingame-api</a>
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, the rest is down to you
 AntiSquid: he downloads replays and extracts the stdout
 Astrobytes: But he (and others) will answer reasonable/sensible questions wrt the subject
 AntiSquid: what i meant is interpreting the .view bit, which is like trying to understand dark magic
 Astrobytes: Waht do you want with the viewer?
 AntiSquid: i mean the view element in the json string
 Astrobytes: iirc from a discussion the other day/night, you need to ignore that whole part
 AntiSquid: his article explains the stdout element
 Astrobytes: It's full of JS right?
 Astrobytes: The view JSON that is
 AntiSquid: more like a cryptic description of where different pieces are on the screen at a given frame
 Astrobytes: Yeah you don't need that iirc, dbdr and eulerscheZahl can go into more detail for you
 Astrobytes: You're looking for the moves
 AntiSquid: i know where the other stuff is
 Astrobytes: Use that and ignore that other BS
 Astrobytes: You know where pieces are and whatnot because you've extracted the moves. ERgo, you don't need the viewer bollocks
 Astrobytes: (Ergo
 Astrobytes: dammit
 AntiSquid: you don't but only way i can find what happened is replay the moves locally 
 AntiSquid: afaik
 Astrobytes: What you just want the actual game result?
 Astrobytes: Or you're looking for timeouts?
 AntiSquid: look at specific frame data
 Astrobytes: I guess then that's local replay, what are you looking for specifically and in what game?
 AntiSquid: in all replays
 AntiSquid: searching for trends
 AntiSquid: xr atm
 Astrobytes: I think you should give euler or reCurs e a shout
 Astrobytes: Or whoever else does stats on replays like that
 Astrobytes: If you're going frame-by-frame that may be different to turns so...
 AntiSquid: it's more like looking for specific scenarios and see how the winning bot reacted to it
 Astrobytes: Still trying to crack Legend on XR?
 Astrobytes: (I don't mean that in a derogatory sense btw)
 AntiSquid: no worries
 Astrobytes: I know I've not worked on my XR for a while, but you might be overthinking it
 AntiSquid: i don't just want legend
 AntiSquid: then i could just go the pacman route and tweak vars + submit spam
 Astrobytes: Yeah but small steps can sometimes take you further than giant leaps into the unknown
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out. Brain no work-y from round-about-now.

 AntiSquid: does my opinion matter more if i get top 10 with D&#160;?
 AntiSquid: well there's a flaw with that logic
 JBM: hell yeah
 AntiSquid: top 10 will skew things in their favor
 JBM: of course they will
 JBM: so become top 10 so it doesn't happen against you
 JBM: gn

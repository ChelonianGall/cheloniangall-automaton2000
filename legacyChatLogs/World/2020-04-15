 Zenoscave: a few tiems
 Zenoscave: times
 ZarthaxX: hi zeno
 Zenoscave: hi zarth
 ZarthaxX: struggling?
 Zenoscave: Yeah
 ZarthaxX: yeah you wont get it
 Zenoscave: maybe
 ZarthaxX: remember what i said in the morning?
 ZarthaxX: its impossible
 Zenoscave: nope
 ZarthaxX: these gates are clsoed
 ZarthaxX: like super closed
 ZarthaxX: im kidding
 Zenoscave: 4 people got through today
 ZarthaxX: buttt its hard
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: i know
 ZarthaxX: and i will go through your m... ohhh 
 ZarthaxX: server is ded?
 Zenoscave: no?
 ZarthaxX: imean
 ZarthaxX: submits
 ZarthaxX: are ded?
 Zenoscave: like no one is submitting?
 ZarthaxX: no
 ZarthaxX: submit freezes?
 Zenoscave: not that i see
 Zenoscave: I have done 6 matches since you asked first
 ZarthaxX: a friend submitted and he is like frozen
 ZarthaxX: this is starting to scare me tho
 Zenoscave: interesting
 Zenoscave: what league?
 ZarthaxX: he ended 80th with same code that ended 5th
 ZarthaxX: gold
 Zenoscave: huh
 Zenoscave: praise RNGesus
 ZarthaxX: that randomness is scary
 ZarthaxX: right? lol
 ZarthaxX: i dont know why i neded where i am
 ZarthaxX: my code is trash
 ZarthaxX: anyyyyyway
 ZarthaxX: keep it up
 Zenoscave: thx
 ZarthaxX: hey u beated me
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(/
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: I need to improve my torpedo accuracy
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: did u disable mines like eul told us
 ZarthaxX: euler
 ZarthaxX: because i did and it sucks
 Zenoscave: yeah i tried. it did not work for me
 ZarthaxX: im gonna demand like sharktoad
 ZarthaxX: that*
 ZarthaxX: stop smacking me zeno
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 eulerscheZahl: good morning
 ZarthaxX: my shark
 ZarthaxX: turning off mine avoidance doesnt help
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: not much longer, soon the toad will be back
 ZarthaxX: FINALLY
 eulerscheZahl: i read that
 ZarthaxX: i miss the toa
 ZarthaxX: d
 ZarthaxX: how can i get legend toad
 eulerscheZahl: i missed your polar bear when you changed it
 ZarthaxX: im bottom gold
 ZarthaxX: yeah ik, u always miss it
 eulerscheZahl: #20 = bottom gold?
 ZarthaxX: its a matter of perspective
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449965145">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449965145</a>collecting mines?
 ZarthaxX: i was kidding tho didnt want you to help me lol
 ZarthaxX: lemme check
 ZarthaxX: also are submits wonky for you?
 ZarthaxX: slow i mean
 eulerscheZahl: haven't submitted in a while
 eulerscheZahl: soon offline: turn private PC off, company PC on
 ZarthaxX: ah ok lol
 eulerscheZahl: still feels weird to work from home
 ZarthaxX: studying from home is the best 
 ZarthaxX: already at home when clas finishes
 ZarthaxX: the replay u showed btw, i got a problem with mines like
 ZarthaxX: it doesnt make sense to avoid them at beginnign coz they are everywhere
 eulerscheZahl: i even did some biking trips to get outside and train my body a bit
 ZarthaxX: but after it does make sense bcause u almost know
 eulerscheZahl: that's desperation&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: weird to model that
 ZarthaxX: mhmm u went outside?
 ZarthaxX: thought u couldnt
 eulerscheZahl: i can, just not in groups
 ZarthaxX: i just can do some home workout
 ZarthaxX: ah i see
 tekki: hi all
 tekki: how's your contest?
 tekki: seems good
 ZarthaxX: gud contest
 tekki: gud?
 tekki: AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: I don't know what that is
 kovi: what is up with queue? got slowerd to 5minutes per game
 tekki: don't know kovi 
 ZarthaxX: af friend said its ded
 tekki: AutomatonNN explanation please
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same as the winner?
 kovi: ah, not the queue, leaderboards were not refreshed for 10+ minutes
 tekki: can't tell, CG here?
 Zenoscave: They're going slightly faster than that in gold
 Zenoscave: still slow though
 Zenoscave: 80% of my losses are to the same player
 tekki: no lucky my friend&#160;:)
 tekki: AUtomatonNN ban him please&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: have you tried to use it and see if i can see that it will be a problem with the same code in the sa
 Zenoscave: I fixed the bug though. I rarely lose to anyone else
 dbdr: kovi matches do look slow to me
 dbdr: what's your submit # now by the way?&#160;:)
 kovi: 600
 dbdr: 191
 Sepehr.khashei: :santa:
 dbdr: level keeps rising it seems
 dbdr: unsurprisingly&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: leaderboard update now completely frozen when submitting ugh&#160;?
 kovi: yes&#160;:(
 idkhow2codee: hi, is it possible to connect codin game to some external code editor?
 Boulet: yep 
 Boulet: look at the FAQ
 idkhow2codee: k thanks
 Boulet: chromium plugin 
 Nerchio: servers are slow since a couple of hours already
 gaha: I have big problem with timeouts, but CG is not showing me my std.err from turn where I had timeout. This would help me debug it, because I don't know where it happens, do you know a way to see it?
 Nerchio: put prints in delicate spots and see what prints last
 RMuskovets: or put prints on every line of your code)
 gaha: printing is giving orders though
 RMuskovets: print("line", 15, file=sys.stderr)
 RMuskovets: cerr &lt;&lt; "line" &lt;&lt; 15 &lt;&lt; endl
 RMuskovets: fprintf(stderr, "line %d\n", 15)
 gaha: Okay then, I do this. And there's a problem, because CG is not showing any logs at all from turn where I had the timeout
 gaha: It shows everything from turns that finished though
 RMuskovets: then, your last turn timeouts on the first line maybe
 gaha: Good guess, but it's not the case&#160;:(
 dbdr: gaha there is nothing to show, if you timeout before printing anything to stderr
 gaha: I don't think it's the case, but I'll print something at the very beginning just to see&#160;:)
 dbdr: yes that's a good idea
 gaha: Oh my god, you're right guys, it does print everything before the timeout
 RMuskovets: after making multi-step dfs for my bot many others look so dumb to me
 gaha: I here I am, wasting the whole day instead of checking it
 Nerchio: rmuskovets like with silence jump?
 marshadow9: hello
 RMuskovets: Nerchio no, not now&#160;:)
 gaha: what is multi-step dfs though
 gaha: whats the modification?
 RMuskovets: getting the last path and when it ends creating a new one&#160;;)
 gaha: Right, so not wasting compute
 RMuskovets: and a turn with it is only 20ms
 RMuskovets: including checking torpedo positions
 gaha: in DFS you have some FILO you're considering is still valid?
 gaha: I mean how are you considering
 RMuskovets: i try every possible path to get longest
 gaha: I imagine you can have path on your queue that are not valid anymore, I mean you've already moved PAST them in the actual game
 gaha: Isn't it right?
 RMuskovets: I don't have a "queue" of all paths. Just when my current path ends, I do SURFACE and create a new one.
 gaha: Ah, okay
 gaha: Well, so you don't modify the "choosen path" during MOVE'ing, but only after the SURFACE
 RMuskovets: Yeah
 gaha: I am modyfing it during MOVE'ing as well, but it was a bit of a pain to implement
 RMuskovets: The best thing with DFS is that the bot never gets stuck between islands
 gaha: And immediately you get a pretty long path
 gaha: In my case it works better to mix BFS and DFS
 gaha: solutions are longer
 Nerchio: how do you combine that?
 gaha: I have a queue, not recursive implementation
 gaha: You can pop from the beginning or from the end
 RMuskovets: When I was trying recursive, my bot just was timing out - not very good
 RMuskovets: Queue is far betetr
 RMuskovets: Better*
 Nerchio: didn't expect it to timeout on a 225 grid
 wlesavo: probably you didnt manage recursion right
 gaha: Oh man, count how many different paths there are
 gaha: It's impossible to calculate all of them
 gaha: It WILL timeout
 qwerio: Can i change the difficulty of the problems i  a private Clash Of Code?
 RMuskovets: Nerchio I did recursion for each of 4 neighbors
 RMuskovets: That was simply a forever recursion loop
 gaha: About the Sync, did anyone made it work in other Chromium browser than Chrome?
 AntiSquid: how to do mine avoidance with 5 mil paths?
 Nerchio: how do you kill something that you can't see?
 fluxtransistor: asking for a friend?
 gaha: Well, it looks like I have timeouts on those lines
 gaha:     sonar_result = input()
 fluxtransistor: Exactly the same problem here.]
 fluxtransistor: Giving me headaches for two days now.
 fluxtransistor: I have decided to rewrite my python code in C because of it
 fluxtransistor: ...first C program yay
 gaha: I suppose CG will send you ERR messages only when next input() happens
 fluxtransistor: I have a timer from the start of my code and if I print the value to stderr before the print call it is about 4 ms
 fluxtransistor: * input call, not print call
 gaha: Yeah, same, I suggest the timeout really happens after those input()
 fluxtransistor: But after the input call it doesn't print at all
 gaha: but you get logs only from before it
 fluxtransistor: Yes
 fluxtransistor: It must be a  bug on their end
 gaha: I need those logs though&#160;:/
 fluxtransistor: I need my code to work, not just the logs&#160;;)
 RMuskovets: Wow, got from 588th to 227th place in leaderboard&#160;:) Today's a productive day for me)
 wlesavo: pb4 switched to python? :grinning:
 pb4: deterministic opponent
 pb4: I've seen things I don't like on a replay
 pb4: but the opponent was not deterministic
 pb4: I push a but that plays the same sequence of actions over and over
 wlesavo: lol
 pb4: though I can switch my main bot to python if you want :innocent:
 wlesavo: no thx, there is enoygh competition already :slight_smile:
 Uljahn: btw in python you could use flush=True for your debug printing, it'll dump your logs before the timeout
 gaha: Thanks, let's see
 RMuskovets: pb4 What'd be the difference? If the algorithm is the same the bot's behavior will be the same... Except the Python
 RMuskovets: 's low speed
 pb4: no interest at all
 gaha: flushing works, thanks A LOT
 Uljahn: yw
 fluxtransistor: oh god thank you for this
 marshadow9: ho
 marshadow9: how do i win the mars lander level 1?
 RMuskovets: marshadow9 afaik you should turn on the engine when vertical speed &gt; 40 m/s
 Scarfield: marshadow9 if your vertical speed downwards exceeds 40 m/s you will crash. You need engine power of 4 to overcome the acceleration from gravity (-3.711m/s^2 iirc) and slow down
 aaronshenhao: Sounds like an interesting optimization + physics problem
 idkhow2codee: hi, c++ question - why I can't skip game output(std::cin) by using std::cin.get()? 
 aaronshenhao: How to further golf this code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/58d72c62-5145-458f-ae70-757d1bceb88a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/58d72c62-5145-458f-ae70-757d1bceb88a</a>
 aaronshenhao: Someone did it in 2 less characters!
 aaronshenhao: Also in Python3
 Scarfield: a=n-xf=lambda x:print("."*(a)+"*"*(x*2+1)+"."*(a))
 Scarfield: 1 shorter at least :p, never been interested in gold though :p
 Scarfield: golf *
 aaronshenhao: Think still the same, since \n counts as 1 character
 RMuskovets: f=lambda x:print("."*a+"*"*(x*2+1)+"."*a)
 aaronshenhao: That would cut it down by 4
 aaronshenhao: They probably used recursion with def
 aaronshenhao: Semi-recursive lambda is pretty cool:a = lambda x: 0 if x == 0 else 1 if x == 1 else a(x-1) + a(x-2)
 RMuskovets: is it fibonacci?
 RMuskovets: aaronshenhao
 aaronshenhao: Yes it is
 aaronshenhao: Fibonacci of  nth number I think
 aaronshenhao: nth Fibonacci number*
 Santyx_Orrer: will the competition go on after the contest has ended?
 aCat: yes
 aCat: the game will go as multi
 RoboStac: aaronshenhao - if you make f an actual function instead of lambda it's two characters less (def f(x): vs f=lambda x:)
 aaronshenhao: Oh yea, that's true. Should only use lambda when returning.
 RoboStac: you can also do "[*map(f,range(n))]" instead of your for loop
 aaronshenhao: O_O
 aaronshenhao: I also learnt today that apparently [*aList] is faster than aList.copy()
 AntiSquid: TOP 20, the dream is closer&#160;:')
 AntiSquid: maybe i should actually add mine avoidance? :thinking:
 DanTheMan832: Any tips for tracking opponent when they use silence? I get close to locating them then their possible positions gets really large again?
 Nerchio: just neeeds time to track them down
 RMuskovets: what's the general "idea" of tracking enemy?
 AntiSquid: of course e need a puzzle of the week
 fluxtransistor: wait so you have dfs, bfs and all but don't track your enemy?
 AntiSquid: dfs is much easier lol
 fluxtransistor: I haven't implemented it yet, but my bfs works really well
 sashaboulouds: Hello guys
 sashaboulouds: Does it exist group coding games
 sashaboulouds: Between teams?
 Uljahn: use sonar and mine triggering to narrow his positions down
 Uljahn: oops frozen chat
 sashaboulouds: Guys
 sashaboulouds: what are u talking about?
 fluxtransistor: The 'ocean of code cah
 fluxtransistor: challenge
 sashaboulouds: wtf is that??
 sashaboulouds: :innocent:
 RMuskovets: fluxtransistor yes, i have dfs but still don't track enemy)
 fluxtransistor: ok lol
 RMuskovets: and i guess silence will be a headache
 fluxtransistor: I guess
 fluxtransistor: What league are you in?
 RMuskovets: wood-1
 RMuskovets: i thought about getting all possible locations for the opponent
 RMuskovets: e.g. if they moved north they couldn't be at the topmost row
 fluxtransistor: The way i do it is I have a list of possible starting positions and just eliminate them by simulating the move history
 fluxtransistor: But yeah that's it in a nutshell
 wlesavo: pb4 i liked your python bot more
 wlesavo: this one is mean to me
 RMuskovets: fluxtransistor i'm gonna try that, thanks)
 pb4: :D
 RMuskovets: i need a opponent that doesn't use silence
 RMuskovets: with boss my tracking algorithm goes "mad" - 0 possible enemy locations
 Illedan: Just nerf your own bot and submit it.
 RMuskovets: does silence have the same range as torpedo?
 RavenKZP: from 0 to 4
 RMuskovets: yeah, like torpedo
 RMuskovets: before silence: 46 unique guessesafter silence: 1886 unique guesses
 RMuskovets: wow, i managed to track myself well) only 2 guesses
 NormantasStankevicius: but
 NormantasStankevicius: doesn't silence only go x or y axis?
 NormantasStankevicius: no Diagonal?
 RMuskovets: yea, no diagonal
 RMuskovets: more chances to track enemy out
 NormantasStankevicius: do you try to track
 NormantasStankevicius: where he was?
 RMuskovets: yes
 RMuskovets: and silence is not THAT bad
 NormantasStankevicius: how do you track where he was?
 RMuskovets: &gt; The way i do it is I have a list of possible starting positions and just eliminate them by simulating the move history
 NormantasStankevicius: after silence
 NormantasStankevicius: yeah, most of us do that
 NormantasStankevicius: but like after silence
 fluxtransistor: Haha just quoting me lol
 RMuskovets: just add every possible position after using silence
 NormantasStankevicius: cause I am thinking of implementing proper silence tracking just thinking how to optimize
 RMuskovets: premature optimization is bad
 NormantasStankevicius: ahh well
 RMuskovets: optimize only when needed AND possible
 NormantasStankevicius: I'll need to do that
 NormantasStankevicius: cause it seems
 NormantasStankevicius: at least in silver 200ranks
 tomatoes: why 46 to 1886? should be 46*17=782 maximum
 NormantasStankevicius: it's better to do no guessing than just placing him anywhere on the map?
 RMuskovets: i was thinking diagonal too
 RMuskovets: wow
 RMuskovets: before move: 3645after move: 148
 RMuskovets: before silence: 58after: 4698... 
 RMuskovets: that's not possible
 RMuskovets: 225*17 = 3825, not filtering unique
 RMuskovets: why can a print (python3) not execute?
 fluxtransistor: try adding flush=True
 RMuskovets: like, i have two prints that should write a big-ass list to stderr each and only first one executes
 RMuskovets: fluxtransistor i already have flush there
 RMuskovets: and no timeout
 RoboStac: are you getting ...'s at the end? CG have limits on how much debug they send you
 RMuskovets: yes, i have ...
 RoboStac: yeah, that means you tried to send too much debug and it's been trimmed
 RMuskovets: How does a player move up in the leaderboard?
 wlesavo: MOVE N
 fluxtransistor: ctrl a --&gt; del --&gt; submit
 RMuskovets: wlesavo :joy:
 RMuskovets: I was serious)
 fluxtransistor: Submit and hope
 fluxtransistor: It will automatically battle
 RMuskovets: I know, but if I win in almost all battles and get lower, what's the reason?
 fluxtransistor: Maybe you won more battles before?
 RMuskovets: E.g. i won in ~70% of my battles but from 219th place got to 234th
 RMuskovets: I need to improve my tracking
 RMuskovets: Even though I mostly win, my tracking is not perfect
 wlesavo: if you want real improvemnt add SILENCE N 0, thats not even a joke
 RMuskovets: I don't understand...
 fluxtransistor: Is it because it confuses 'strategic' bots?
 fluxtransistor: As in they don't expect it?
 wlesavo: charge silence and use it for 0
 wlesavo: no its because its hard to screw up with this
 Kiat: why this silence N 0 is a valid command and show up?
 wlesavo: its valid by rules
 gaha: there are players that assume you're doing SILENCE 0 and this is funny
 wlesavo: add one silence 3 in early turns and they will timeout
 wlesavo: whole silence tactics on a plate
 kovi: how do you know?&#160;:)
 gaha: so this is what you do in Legend League
 wlesavo: kovi :smiley:
 wlesavo: gaha whis is what kovi did for quite a while, not sure if he still does that
 RoboStac: gaha - I only ever do silence 0 (due to lazyness) and it's enough to get to legend so there can't be that many that do that
 fluxtransistor: Does the scoring count your life at the end of the game?
 RoboStac: no, just win/loss/draw
 fluxtransistor: Good - my torpedo bot is slightly self-harming
 E_pur_si_muove: SILENCE 0, or SILENCE x: does it make a difference? I guess no.
 E_pur_si_muove: it's just easier to "calculate" SILENCE 0.
 wlesavo: if you estimate badly you can end up in worse position, so thats the difference, also saving space for movement 
 kovi: with slow refresh and multiple submits i lost track again what helps and what isnt
 AntiSquid: i don't like this either, but this is like halite
 Nerchio: what is it like
 RavenKZP: AntiSquid do you sleep sometimes? or at all? :D
 Illedan: RoboStac, Silence 0 is enough for the top too :P (except for the final kill though)
 RoboStac: yeah, I've not got any final kill code yet
 AntiSquid: i work from home and i am bored so i drop a line in chat whenever RavenKZP
 boura0013: Hello everyone
 boura0013: I like this
 boura0013: Just started using
 boura0013: any tips?
 RavenKZP: So do I
 boura0013: hullo peeps
 JanisSerzants: Can I minimize sonar, torpedo and silance cooldown in one turn?
 boura0013: i dont know
 gaha: You can choose one ability to charge
 JanisSerzants: One ability per turn?
 gaha: Well, actually one ability per MOVE command
 JanisSerzants: :fearful:
 JanisSerzants: So what do you think, whats is more important, sonar, torpedo or silance?
 AntiSquid: silicone *
 gaha: I don't think silence is for attack
 JanisSerzants: That is what I said, i'm a defence guy, I think I will stick with silance
 gaha: most of the times you use it to hide
 gaha: Oh, yeah, sorry
 gaha: misread
 gaha: you usually want to have your torpedo charged though
 boura0013: hope that you suceed in whatever you are doing
 boura0013: and i am NOT a bot
 JanisSerzants: Thanks! Hope you will do great as well!
 boura0013: Yeah i am doing one of the easier puzzles
 boura0013: i am suceeding
 boura0013:&#160;:)
 JanisSerzants: Well my plan is to get as long water road as possible and move forward and backward, that got me out from wood 2
 JanisSerzants: Now on wood2 I need to run if possible, and fire from the back
 JanisSerzants: gaha, I can move with silance in a straight line only?
 gaha: Yes
 gaha: people often do silence 0, since you don't need to write much code to do this
 JanisSerzants: what does silance 0 does?
 gaha: does nothing, but you enemy does not know what silence you did
 gaha: so if he wants to keep track of your position, he needs to assume you might have done something
 JanisSerzants: hmm, well I should try it as well, are you doing it?
 Uljahn: im doing silence 1 with the same logic as move
 gaha: I did, but I am doing longer ones now as well
 boura0013: hello
 boura0013: wish you luck in your activities
 boura0013: and hopes and dreams of course
 JanisSerzants: can i do silance and shoot torpedo in same time?
 Nerchio: yes
 69razer69: gogo go
 vincent-vdb: does someone know how to get the final 'input()' (my_life, opp_life...) after the game over?
 dbdr: you can't
 aaronshenhao: haxx
 Astrobytes: Submits broken?
 dbdr: very slow
 vincent-vdb: thanks, then anyone managed to use reinforcement learning without the final outcome?
 Astrobytes: Oh I see on the discord
 gaha: you could do ML if you downloaded game in java
 RMuskovets: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodingGameCommunity/">https://github.com/CodingGameCommunity/</a>from here?
 gaha: y
 RMuskovets: a mistake, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/</a>
 gaha: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code</a>
 Uljahn: using RL means you play the game offline and then upload the weights of the model trying to fit in 100k IDE limit
 vincent-vdb: thanks gaha, I'm not used to java though and I don't manage to do more than the README example! But I will keep trying
 gaha: so I didn't do it myself, but installing requirements and running the game is not that hard
 gaha: later I imagine you want to print your data to a file instead of error stream
 JanisSerzants: gaha, how can I use only silance, just typing SILANCE 0 is crashing
 gaha: you can use those files to learn
 gaha: SILENCE S 0
 gaha: you need to pass direction
 gaha: any direction
 RMuskovets: any from N,W,S,E
 vincent-vdb: Thanks Uljahn, indeed 100k is quite small for a model... probably not a good idea
 aaronshenhao: Captcha is sabotaging me<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/w86y25Q">https://imgur.com/w86y25Q</a>
 aaronshenhao: :P
 JanisSerzants: SILANCE E 0 killed me 
 gaha: well, i don't know what SILANCE is
 JanisSerzants: MOVE SILANCE E 0 as well
 gaha: SILENCE E 0 should work
 JanisSerzants: :P 
 RMuskovets: aaronshenhao there is captcha?
 JanisSerzants: Greates weakness of developer is typo
 aaronshenhao: I keep getting catchas lol RMuskovets
 Uljahn: RMuskovets: in Clashes yes
 RMuskovets: wow, didn't see that before
 Uljahn: you should play a lot of CoCs to see it
 RMuskovets: a lot of CoCs = not that much of OoC that's more interesting for me
 RMuskovets: i meant, OoC is more interesting that CoC
 ZarthaxX: dbdr Astrobytes submits slow still?
 Astrobytes: yeah ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: wow they were like that 12 hours ago
 aaronshenhao: What's OoC
 ZarthaxX: ocean of code
 ZarthaxX: current contet
 ZarthaxX: contest
 aaronshenhao: I only play clash lol, so idk
 ZarthaxX: ah ok :P
 abuntuu: hi
 ZarthaxX: hai
 DanTheMan832: I'm better than the boss but I haven't been promoted??
 RoboStac: you have to wait for your matches to reach 100%
 DanTheMan832: oh ok
 wlesavo: wanted to relax a bit, so went to play some tron, got to legend with 200 lines without even implementing any minimax type algo, basicaly one heuristic and estimation of voronoi diagram on depth 1, without considering any of opponent actions, is it supposed to be that easy? 
 dbdr: wlesavo I think you have great intuition for heuristics&#160;:)
 wlesavo: hm
 dbdr: as you proved in OOC
 ZarthaxX: how did u do that
 ZarthaxX: fucking beast D:
 nicknobody: language!!!
 wlesavo: well it is my second legend, conting ooc for the first, i guess i will try to find some more heuristics in another games :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: ZarthaxX well heuristic was to stick to my body or map edges when im isolated, basically thats it
 ZarthaxX: mhmm
 ZarthaxX: impressive, super simple
 ZarthaxX: any tips on how you work out your heuristics?
 ZarthaxX: im weak on that aspect
 nicknobody: can some one help me with ocean od code
 wlesavo: i dunno, most of that seems just to be a general sence
 ZarthaxX: mmhm i see
 ZarthaxX: can i give an example with a replay of ooc
 TheDoubleLlama_6c58: hello guys
 wlesavo: sure
 TheDoubleLlama_6c58: is there a requirement here to make the lowest number of steps possible?
 ZarthaxX: like in this case <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450123549">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450123549</a>
 ZarthaxX: frame 143 and forward
 ZarthaxX: if you were to abnalyze that
 ZarthaxX: would u say main error was to reveal on shot?
 ZarthaxX: or the error may have come from before
 ZarthaxX: due to the pathing
 ZarthaxX: i find it hard in games to see sometimes where the main problemis
 ZarthaxX: to adjust the heuristics of a shot in this case
 ZarthaxX: so many corner cases 
 Skril: Hi, you might have not used silence on frame 132Did not improve your visibilityCould have been used right after torpedo shot
 wlesavo: i guess tough luck, but there is definetely one thing wrong with this replay, not charging torpedo after shooting
 wlesavo: also that, yes
 ZarthaxX: Skril right, im checking now to improve the silence heuristic, ty
 ZarthaxX: thanks wlesavo appreciated
 wlesavo: Skril nice sub btw
 Skril: thanks&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: you were gold couple days ago right Skril? great improvement past days
 Skril: some tiny improvements (like this silence thing) had great impact&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: oh for real?
 ZarthaxX: nice them, gives me hope
 ZarthaxX: great work dude
 ZarthaxX: then*
 Skril: thanks&#160;:-)good luck&#160;!
 ZarthaxX: ty
 struct: Were you at the top before Skril?
 wlesavo: i think in silver he was
 Skril: reached temporarily #5 in silver if I remember right
 ZarthaxX: submits are still wonky right?
 pb4: "some tiny improvements (like this silence thing) had great impact&#160;:-)"
 pb4: tell me more ^^

 wlesavo: i kinda stoped with tiny improovements cause they didnt seemed to give much impact, but probably i should come back
 wlesavo: damn, my enemy detection has twice the length of the full tron code
 ZarthaxX: lol
 gaha: yeah, how many code lines do you have?
 Skril: pb4&#160;: mostly improvements on mine over-avoidance and compact pathing&#160;;-)
 wlesavo: tryed to do smth like that if i understand correctly
 darkhorse64: wlesavo: i think we have the same tron bot. Other multis are much much harder
 wlesavo: darkhorse64 yeah, just was surprised by that
 kovi: top is getting packed more and more, no clear top3 any more
 MadKnight: sure thing helloi
 MadKnight: responded to an old message
 NormantasStankevicius: Question guys, how do you optimize
 darkhorse64: Contests also are getting much and much harder
 NormantasStankevicius: the insane amount of predictions of the enemy after silence?
 darkhorse64: We pray and hope for the best&#160;?
 NormantasStankevicius: so if someone spams silence
 NormantasStankevicius: god has not answered your prayers, huh?
 darkhorse64: Sort of 
 NormantasStankevicius: let me guess
 NormantasStankevicius: you have a ductape fix for that xd??
 darkhorse64: Silence spamming is effective when there are very few islands. Otherwise, after a few moves, tracking reduces drastically your choices
 NormantasStankevicius: thanks for the idea&#160;;)
 Uljahn: also you can use sonar and trigger mines to further reduce enemy positions
 nicknobody: you guys love gaming
 aaronshenhao: How does this even work:f=lambda n:n and n/5+f(n/5)
 pb4: kovi&#160;: agreed onthe very packed leaderboard
 pb4: also below the top 5, people are getting closer and closer
 pb4: It's really hard to climb now&#160;:/
 NormantasStankevicius: hmmm
 NormantasStankevicius: Seems like I won't leave silver
 NormantasStankevicius: without silence counter
 NormantasStankevicius: well
 NormantasStankevicius: let's go
 aaronshenhao: Nvm I get it now, it's python2 that's why
 wlesavo: works in python 3.8 also
 wlesavo: but returns n/4, duuno what it is supposed to do
 aaronshenhao: Should be int I thought
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f57e224b-b86e-4c20-ae5d-09ca6d2bc731">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f57e224b-b86e-4c20-ae5d-09ca6d2bc731</a>
 JFB: Funny thing on leaderboard - nus_miz is first in Gold - and last in Legend (simultanously)&#160;:-)
 idkhow2codee: I don't know what's the purpose of MSG command but I have an idea for example I would type some fake commands so if enemy's bot doesn't handle MSG command properly then it would be gg
 icecream17: nah, just for debug. enemy doesn't get your messages
 wlesavo: enemy bot does not get the msg command
 JFB: MSG  is for display something on the screen 
 idkhow2codee: haha k
 idkhow2codee: what a shame
 icecream17: what if there was a seperate thing, called "enemy message"? then cooperating people could tie...
 icecream17: aw but some people would cheat the system.. hmm
 idkhow2codee: hmm
 Nerchio: i mean if you tried hard you could do it anyway
 icecream17: could we do it without msg? like, up up left left down down or something?
 RavenKZP: Thats for what are MSG messages: :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/450145961">https://www.codingame.com/replay/450145961</a>
 icecream17: =O Raven you are genuis
 RavenKZP: all my bots use them in taht way :D
 Nerchio: damn it's hard to test when submit goes so slow
 wlesavo: icecream17  in #ru we just disscussed that such thing could be used to promote bots in legend, through spam submiting and thats why the servers are so laggy today, but that is sounds more like conspiracy theory
 ZarthaxX: dont test :P
 icecream17: well, i'm stuck in silver. (20 days or so)
 icecream17: aw... i didn't get to see the whole lyrics

 AntiSquid: lol lagging server to prevent legend promotion :D
 AntiSquid: CG servers are always in bad shape unfortunately
 Nerchio: " Issue was with the DB, it should be better now (or soon, the time that all waiting games get played)"
 ZarthaxX: where did u get thqat from
 struct: discord
 Nerchio: ^
 ZarthaxX: ah i saw it ty
 ZarthaxX: y
 Nerchio: I will wait till its faster otherwise i can't test my bot properly
 Riyuk: That's why it's worth it to have a local arena&#160;:/
 Nerchio: we can download from github maybe i will try to set it up
 JFB: Made local arena is not difficult (you can use githab as start point, maybe use brutaltester from github too) - but local arena has disadvantage that you can play only with your bots. Or maybe, if you gently ask  siman, he will send you his bot - for test purpose only of course&#160;;-)
 Nerchio: lol :p
 AntiSquid: you just download the game and edit the main file into some local arena manager which takes whatever bots you want and plays them against each other in whatever way you want
 Riyuk: Lol :D Against an old bot is fine enough to see the changes!
 AntiSquid: Zenoscave so close
 jules1: anybody have any advice for coders strike back
 AntiSquid: yes, quit it and play contest instead
 Nerchio: haha come on :P
 jules1: lol
 Nerchio: if i played that i would give you some advice :D
 jules1: lol is there any bot programming challenge thats fun that i should try
 jules1: contest?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Nerchio: depends what you consider fun haha
 AntiSquid: well these people in chat keep saying the contest is fun, so try it
 AntiSquid: if you ask me for a fun multi i will recommend you something else
 AntiSquid: but not CSB
 jules1: ok whats a fun multi :P
 DanTheMan832: What does MSG do
 AntiSquid: nothing
 AntiSquid: what type of games do you like jules?
 Nerchio: MSG prints a message below your portrait in the game
 jules1: i like something simple to pick up on, like not overly complicated at the outset
 AntiSquid: CSB gets complicated later on
 jules1: yeah and im all good with that
 jules1: so long as its not too complicated at the very beginning&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ah
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a> 
 AntiSquid: very simple 
 AntiSquid: to start off with
 jules1: ok ill give that a try! thank you&#160;:) 
 Nerchio: damn i missed so many fun games over the years :p
 RavenKZP: CSB?
 RavenKZP: oh ctrike back
 AntiSquid: Common Serial Bus, far inferior to USB
 RavenKZP: for me 10/10 one of the best
 Zenoscave: BotG is best game
 AntiSquid: thanks
 Zenoscave: it says so in the opening
 AntiSquid: if you would make a game what would you do Zenoscave?
 Zenoscave: not sure. probably something math based
 Nerchio: i like ocean of code best but its the only one i played
 AntiSquid: they all require math afaik
 Zenoscave: I mean truly math based like crypto math
 Nerchio: ameler first in gold
 Nerchio: new legend incoming?
 Zenoscave: probably
 Nerchio: you just beat me zenos
 Zenoscave: I see&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: you just beat me
 ameler: I hope&#160;!!!!
 Nerchio: but this commit has a bug in killer moves
 ameler:&#160;:)
 Nerchio: they don't trigger
 AntiSquid: there's a chance you end up 2nd though and then get dropped, happened to me twice in a past contest
 ameler: yes&#160;:/
 Nerchio: no chance
 Nerchio: ameler goes legend
 ZarthaxX: *fails in the end*
 Zenoscave: still a chance his score isn't high enough yet
 ZarthaxX: its not updating zeno lol
 AntiSquid: 0.24
 Nerchio: matches are getting played faster and faster
 Nerchio: finally
 AntiSquid: ah higher diff now
 Zenoscave: probably going through now
 Nerchio: so i have a question
 ZarthaxX: gz&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: We have answers
 Nerchio: how do i avoid losses where i walk on a minefield before seeing the enemy
 Nerchio: seems luckbased
 Zenoscave: don't walk on the minefield
 ZarthaxX: dont walk into it
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Nerchio: damn
 ZarthaxX: oh zeno you&#160;:*
 Nerchio: i haven't thought of that
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 AntiSquid: very helpful haha
 ZarthaxX: but its true
 Zenoscave: surface and reverse
 AntiSquid: or silence near mines
 NormantasStankevicius: xd
 NormantasStankevicius: silence dash to enemy
 NormantasStankevicius: AND FIRE
 AntiSquid: they detonate that shit because they are too eager
 Nerchio: the funniest thing was when i submited with silence broken
 Nerchio: didnt use it at all
 Nerchio: and still was top150 gold lol
 ZarthaxX: top150 is not much anyway
 Zenoscave: that is barely top half
 Nerchio: damn you both are so brutal
 Nerchio: you know how to put man down
 Zenoscave: Thanks
 ZarthaxX: looooooooooooool
 AntiSquid: bots keep improving, top 150 will be top 250 in few days
 AntiSquid: but Nerchio it's true
 AntiSquid: if you were here back when contest started you'd notice some from the initial top whatever you want to call top are now in silver or low gold
 Nerchio: also funny is that i use flood fill for movement but it looks the same as people with dfs
 AntiSquid: uhm
 Nerchio: I didn't realise before yesterday that this even is already like a month
 Zenoscave: very few cases will they differ
 Nerchio: i saw people that submited on 6th or something and was like "wow they wrote the bot in 5 hours and are top gold" ;p
 Nerchio: but the battles had been going for quite a while
 icecream17: 5 hours? wow
 idkhow2codee: can I move in the same turn when I surface?
 Nerchio: yes
 idkhow2codee: ty
 Nerchio: so zenos
 Zenoscave: yes
 Nerchio: what happened between your 2nd place and 36 now
 eulerscheZahl: when legend?
 Zenoscave: new submit. testing things
 eulerscheZahl: do you have the killer feature now?
 Zenoscave: I do
 ZarthaxX: he is not gonna make it
 ZarthaxX: the feature that inclues not knowing the position?
 Zenoscave: I lose dog fights too much
 eulerscheZahl: it's tradition for him to stay in gold?
 ZarthaxX: dog fights?
 ZarthaxX: yeah he liked the gold color
 Zenoscave: close combat
 ZarthaxX: ah ye hate those
 ZarthaxX: maybe the solution is to avoid them
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, in some cases it's possible to enforce a win without knowing the exact location of the opponent
 Zenoscave: i don't think my code is set up for that yet
 ZarthaxX: i remember
 ZarthaxX: clever thinking toad
 eulerscheZahl: but now i lost all my motivation
 eulerscheZahl: did better in the last marathon, ignoring the first half entirely
 rwilson: eulerscheZahl quick question - did your stats gathering learn anything interesting about the map layouts?   a couple folks posted seeds where there were isolated 'ponds' of water... kinda curious if it's just rare? or insanely rare... 
 jules1: can anyone here answer a question about botters of the galaxy?
 Nerchio: i had a seed that was split map with bot like 80 squares and no way to reach another
 Zenoscave: Anti can answer about BotG
 icecream17: current pos variables: currx and....
 jules1: im just wondering how i know what items i can buy.. i dont see that info anywhere in the rules, and maybe its just that the javascript starter code doesnt make it obvious or even doesnt do something right, but i dont see how i figure that out
 icecream17: in Ocean of code??
 Zenoscave: no icecream17
 rwilson:&#160;;) the first i saw was a TINY little pond &amp; both bots chose to live in it...    i'm sure anyone doing random start point will eventually land in a bad isolated pond &amp; get surfaced to death 
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid
 Zenoscave: BotG question ^
 icecream17: oh oops i wasn't listening sorry
 jules1: no problem :P 
 jules1: although if anybody out there can answer this broader question, thatd be great: is the starter code on these games not supposed to be changed?
 jules1: or does it frequently need to be changed
 jules1: (depending on the language)
 Zenoscave: frequently needs change
 jules1: ok lol good to know!
 Zenoscave: Starter code only doesn't crash. never intended to do well
 icecream17: I need an autochange bot for starting things....
 rwilson: changed ... but usually gets you to the first input .. but not always enough to get even 1 turn done right.
 jules1: ah interesting
 rwilson: jules1 the rules section on Botters should have the items info in the Game Input section  ( though, it does not list out all the items possibly given to you... just how to read their properties )
 yfprojects: Are you able to do some calculations while opponents turn? or is it allowed?
 Zenoscave: yfprojects it's possible but it isn't much time or worth setting up
 Zenoscave: not worth it
 yfprojects: its up to 100ms more
 Zenoscave: if you can thread the code. you only run on 1 cpu. you get maybe 25ms out of it total
 Zenoscave: but it's difficult
 yfprojects: so its allowed?
 Zenoscave: sure go for it.
 yfprojects: i'll probably do it if I dont have enough time
 Zenoscave: I'm telling you top players have tried and found it was not enough time to be worth the setup
 yfprojects: mmh
 icecream17: monomethylhydrazine???
 icecream17: (what i got when i searched it up)
 Zenoscave: icecream17 lol
 yfprojects: what did you search?
 Zenoscave: mmh
 yfprojects: go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/mmh">https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/mmh</a>
 yfprojects: used mostly for thinking
 Zenoscave: auchso
 icecream17: oh. i don't know anything other than english....
 rwilson: yfprojects - a few key details about multi-threaded ...   your time is accounted for across threads ( so you don't get 'extra' time by splitting it up...  and your process is effectively paused while waiting for your opponent. so you can't 'think' while their turn is running...
 Zenoscave: rwilson some were able to fork-exec and avoid this limitation
 yfprojects: not always i think
 Zenoscave: but the setup is much too much to result in extra time
 yfprojects: i got up to 100ms extra time
 yfprojects: well, sometimes only 11ms
 eulerscheZahl: yfprojects 07:03PMAre you able to do some calculations while opponents turn? or is it allowed?
 eulerscheZahl: i tested that already
 eulerscheZahl: you get a few extra percent in the timeframe between switching threads but as Zenoscave said: not worth the effort
 rwilson: Zenoscave i'd be curious to see the setup, ( i'll go forum diving later ) ..    last i looked into it ( years ago now )  it looked like CG's stance was to track it tightly, so there's no unfair advantage
 yfprojects: mybe my tests were buggy
 Zenoscave: well said euler
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/450221371">https://www.codingame.com/replay/450221371</a> it doesn't get more drawish than this...
 eulerscheZahl: what a boring match
 Illedan: Pacifist bot?
 AntiSquid: why wouldn't any of them try to guess the opponent might follow the same "best idea"&#160;?
 icecream17: hey, can anyone find a really really really empty map?
 yfprojects: seed=-430391657what about this one?
 icecream17: great! thanks
 icecream17: now to figure out a very good strategy for silencers
 Nerchio: antisquid you beat me in my submit
 Nerchio: i just walked over your mines
 Nerchio: and i already changed my mine-avoidance pretty high =/
 yfprojects: @eulerscheZahl and @Zenoscave could you look at this test code? 
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4e1f54ab-6595-47a8-bd95-34ccb8cff114">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4e1f54ab-6595-47a8-bd95-34ccb8cff114</a>
 yfprojects: is for tictactoe
 idkhow2codee: how to advance to higher div?
 Illedan: Submit a bot better than the boss
 rwilson: idkhow2codee - when your submitted bot has a higher 'score' than the league boss.   Roughly that's win&#160;% rate against everyone else in the league.
 idkhow2codee: oh k thanks for clear explanation
 rwilson:&#160;;) just being able to beat the boss 'head to head' is not enough&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: you walked into mines then your mine avoidance isn't high Nerchio
 idkhow2codee: :grin:
 AntiSquid: read my bot messages for debug help
 Nerchio: i should make the whole map one big mine
 wolf-555: hello 
 icecream17: Go around the opponent in a circle and surround them with mines
 Nerchio: go outside map boundaries so they can't find you
 rwilson: Mine change reactions would have been a fun addition to OOC.
 rwilson: ...  CHAIN  ..&#160;:( 
 Nerchio: i think maybe possibility to destroy mines with shot would be okay
 Nerchio: not sure how often it would be used though
 Illedan: If you could kill mines with shot, you can simple shoot ahead of yourself
 AntiSquid: it's inspired from captain sonar, which is different
 Illedan: and clear the path
 Nerchio: nah
 AntiSquid: clear path at the cost of giving away your position
 Nerchio: you shoot you can get countered
 Illedan: But I'm not sure if the game would better.
 AntiSquid: well captain sonar surely got popular for a reason
 icecream17: What about a new option to charge...
 AntiSquid: no
 yfprojects: a mine defuser
 eulerscheZahl: yfprojects that's an academic example: you test it in wood, where the opponent takes close to 0 time in most matches
 yfprojects: no i play against myself
 eulerscheZahl: that invalidates my argument
 eulerscheZahl: wait, it doesn'tyour main thread responds instantly
 eulerscheZahl: so the most time consumed is referee + communication
 yfprojects: oh i deleted that part
 eulerscheZahl: and there is a small gain between thread switching
 eulerscheZahl: 2ms compared to 0.001ms is a lot2ms to 100ms isn't
 icecream17: What if you could charge supersonar? You immediately get the opponent position with 15 charge!
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b275752-ca90-427a-b8b8-1a8baf3f18b0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3b275752-ca90-427a-b8b8-1a8baf3f18b0</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i could run your code to check for actual timings
 AntiSquid: Icelemon maybe your issue is that you don't like how some skills work, let's talk about that instead?
 AntiSquid: icecream17 * 
 AntiSquid: damn accidentally pinged your brother
 yfprojects: icecream17 that would be stupid and boring
 icecream17: hmm.... what about.... hmm....
 AntiSquid: as boring as all multis with full information
 icecream17: oh righ
 Nerchio: michael pu first in gold
 icecream17: what about teleport? it take 50 charge...
 AntiSquid: more appealing to some than others so ...
 AntiSquid: 50 charges?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171131/captain-sonar">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/171131/captain-sonar</a> icecream17
 AntiSquid: oh there are drones in the original
 eulerscheZahl: i tried different delays in your time.sleepbut no notable difference in the iterations
 eulerscheZahl: you would expect a linear correlation for this to work
 eulerscheZahl: drones are pretty much the sonar in the contest
 Nerchio: i am 3-1 vs michael pu in practice
 yfprojects: but you gain Some time from what i dont know
 Nerchio: just shows how brutal gold is
 eulerscheZahl: while the original sonar allows the opponent to give you 2 pieces of information about the own location (sector, x, y) where 1 is true and 1 is false
 eulerscheZahl: but that would complicate the protocol
 dbdr: independent answers for x and y?
 AntiSquid: oh the real sonar would make the contest more "exciting" lol
 eulerscheZahl: give both x and y, but one of them has to be a lie and you don't say which is wrong
 eulerscheZahl: and x and sector or y and sector
 eulerscheZahl: 17 more users, then we have as many as UTG
 AntiSquid: well that would narrow down paths a bit
 AntiSquid: even if one is a lie
 yfprojects: would be intersting 
 dbdr: can the referee respond "I always lie"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: true, but forces the opponent to handle the opponent sonar
 kovi: i think something different is needed. almost no matter what i change (even badly) the result is the same
 eulerscheZahl: same here kovi, just 30 ranks below
 dbdr: I was thinking 140 matches is not a lot for legend
 dbdr: don't you think?
 eulerscheZahl: my bot doesn't even have huge winrate differences against top vs bottom
 Illedan: For this game you need 140 matches vs each player :P
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday morning i checked and was 2nd from the bottom
 eulerscheZahl: in the afternoon is was in the middle
 eulerscheZahl: without even submitting
 Illedan: Very low difference
 Illedan: And someone spamming
 AntiSquid: now boss is 2 point abovve #2
 AntiSquid: YoBo must feel horrible :D
 eulerscheZahl: legend is big enough already
 Illedan: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: we are closed
 Illedan: Fly little boss
 AntiSquid: hah you wish
 dbdr: yeah, 40
 Illedan: up up and away
 dbdr: that's it
 icecream17: Rating should be like "10.56" with 29867 variation
 Illedan: Yeah, I'll close it now
 MichaelPu: not so closed
 eulerscheZahl: let's tell saiksy to put a stronger boss
 dbdr: grats MichaelPu!
 MichaelPu: thanks
 AntiSquid: almost sounds like some migrant crisis :D
 Illedan: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and CG will pay for it
 eulerscheZahl: wait, bad metaphorgold league players will pay
 AntiSquid: but only wlesavo built the wall
 coderinblack: ok
 icecream17: Hmmm.... "switch players" option for 40 charge
 icecream17: "infinite mines" for 50 charge
 AntiSquid: you realize that's 50 turns of doing nothing but charging?
 icecream17: It *might* be worth it
 icecream17: But why do you charge when you move?
 AntiSquid: feel the wrath of Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how is the contest winner
 icecream17: Shouldn't it be the other way around
 icecream17: I just thought of "Glitch"
 icecream17: ooh... what should it do?
 AntiSquid: make your own CG game&#160;:/
 icecream17: too hard to do that, dont feel like it
 icecream17: oh well.
 icecream17: Maybe I should code something like "type of player". Like... "silence 0ers" or something
 icecream17: Sonar looks more and more like a good option...
 Illedan: What league?
 icecream17: silver
 AntiSquid: In 1958, at age 15, Bobby Fischer became the youngest chess player in history to be named grandmaster, the highest title possible. icecream17
 AntiSquid: and you say making a CG game is too hard icecream17
 Illedan: As long as you have decent mines + decent tracker. You should be able to reach legend&#160;:)
 Illedan: *gold
 AntiSquid: probably doesn't tkae much more to get legend either
 Illedan: Legend requires a good tracker I think
 AntiSquid: considering how flawed and incomplete my bot is
 icecream17: My bot is currently worse than yours now
 kovi: maybe i was wrong. same top4 is separated once again
 icecream17: baboulaf's profile picture tricked me
 icecream17: i'm surprised i win half the time - anyone who triggers a mine i instant -1
 icecream17: nevermind, i only sometimes -1
 icecream17: nevermind, i -1 for no reason
 AntiSquid: more features more timeouts
 ZarthaxX: gg squido
 RavenKZP: better features better timeouts 
 Q12: Who can I contact to give an advice for improving the website?
 eulerscheZahl: Q12 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/c/feedback-bugs">https://www.codingame.com/forum/c/feedback-bugs</a>
 Q12: Thanks
 Nerchio: get rekt zenos :d
 Summit: i am bad at coding
 Q12: You will get better during the time.
 icecream17: Breach test case number 1 is called "simple"
 Summit: Thanks :grinning:
 icecream17: All my guesses are failing...
 Q12: Don' Give Up:grinning:
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX luck
 Summit: How did you learn coding
 AntiSquid: i made a wish
 AntiSquid: i have 2 wishes left
 AntiSquid: now get an avatar Summit
 Summit: i have one its just not showing
 AntiSquid: ah i see it now
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid luck?
 ZarthaxX: what
 AntiSquid: Summit do you know how to code or just starting?
 Summit: Just starting
 AntiSquid: ya ZarthaxX, you lucker if my bot wasn't so bad you would have your ass handed to you, lucker
 AntiSquid: do the easy puzzles Summit
 Summit: Ok i will
 AntiSquid: or get started with an easier site if this is still too hard
 Summit: Ok thanks for the advice
 icecream17: Oh yeah, relief! I "successfully...."
 ZarthaxX: i just said gg randomnly squid lol
 Summit: What coding platform is the easiest to learn?
 AntiSquid: but you won ZarthaxX
 AntiSquid: and i was joking 
 Nerchio: mlomb #1 ;o
 mlomb: finally
 Counterbalance: zarthy's alt?
 mlomb: top gold meta is so random and broken
 AntiSquid: lol Counterbalance
 AntiSquid: they aren't even same animal
 ZarthaxX: alt? Counterbalance
 ZarthaxX: he is another boi
 AntiSquid: did you check him?
 AntiSquid: to make sure? 
 ZarthaxX: ye&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: same flag/uni - you know each other in RL?
 Nerchio: lets goooooooooo
 Nerchio: good submikt
 AntiSquid: oh shit, mlomb is ZarthaxX's teacher :o
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance not yet
 Nerchio: thomasnicoulaud is my hardest enemy&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: we go to same uni tho, he is starting this year cout
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance
 ZarthaxX: and nico is gone Nerchio
 ZarthaxX: LMAO
 Nerchio: what? :D
 ZarthaxX: i saw him get golden
 Nerchio: i am crushing the top atm
 ZarthaxX: i think he promoted..
 Nerchio: zathrax u got owned 3 times
 ZarthaxX: yeah i hate u
 AntiSquid: his avatar animal makes him look older though, ZarthaxX
 Nerchio: lechuck 4 times
 Nerchio: hahaha
 Nerchio: zathrax
 Nerchio: xDD
 Nerchio: 5-1
 Astrobytes: Tardax
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 ZarthaxX: what did u change
 ZarthaxX: shh Astrobytes
 Counterbalance: you still have the CotC hat, tsk
 AntiSquid: Nerchio you need to say: gg ZarthaxXand then silence, most effective
 ZarthaxX: Nerchio promoting
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 Nerchio: damn the curse of first place
 ZarthaxX: 3 promotes
 AntiSquid: well done Nerchio
 Nerchio: lost 3 times
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: ha :P
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance ppl want the hat
 Counterbalance: make all brutal...End of game 100       17,00% 78,00%/flip
 Nerchio: i will ragequit if i dont make it
 ZarthaxX: u can just resubmit Nerchio
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: nico is gone
 AntiSquid: can happen Nerchio
 AntiSquid: but then you might also get pushed over night
 AntiSquid: so ...
 Nerchio: zzzzzz
 Nerchio: 6-6 last matches
 Counterbalance: decent lead
 Nerchio: and zathrax beat me
 Nerchio: :D
 AntiSquid: you know where he lives, must not be too far from his uni Nerchio
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 Nerchio: i will just keep submiting
 ZarthaxX: just dont feed boss Nerchio
 Nerchio: this 
 Nerchio: until i advance
 AntiSquid: lol
 ZarthaxX: and u fed him
 AntiSquid: rekt
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 Nerchio: ye i lost like
 Nerchio: 6 times to lechuck
 Nerchio: he got lucky
 AntiSquid: no point resubmitting you shoot yourself in the leg if you overfeed boss
 AntiSquid: best to just park the bot there on #2
 AntiSquid: until you improve
 Nerchio: looks like
 Nerchio: i can go 10-0 vs captain and 0-10 as well
 AntiSquid: but hey well done :D
 Nerchio: last 30 matches
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX you better learn from him
 Nerchio: is like
 Nerchio: all wins except 2 vs everyone
 Nerchio: and every game against boss was loss
 Nerchio: looks like captain le chuck got lucky this time
 Nerchio: back to the drawing board vs le chuck
 icecream17: Yes! 518 -&gt; 400ish
 AntiSquid: yes finally eliminated one of the timeouts jeez
 AntiSquid: icecream17 just get a decent opponent tracking, track all his steps
 icecream17: i don't have one already? what am i missing?
 AntiSquid: you do?
 icecream17: i don't know. i think it's more that i don't blow up my mines or torpedo well enough
 AntiSquid: ok let me try to give you an idea
 AntiSquid: this is me tracking the opponent, the numbers represent how many possible paths are at each position:
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/81e93d67-3924-4e33-a3cb-15d21026e2b2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/81e93d67-3924-4e33-a3cb-15d21026e2b2</a>
 FrankR: AntiSquid: does the number of paths matter? I just track the possible positions  only
 AntiSquid: and this is me timing out vs silver boss in a very sophisticated manner: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450333752">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/450333752</a>
 AntiSquid: idk, i think it does? i mean i got from 250+ to top 50 gold after i started tracking everything, but maybe it's not needed
 RavenKZP: FrankR I'm tracking only possible points&#160;:)
 icecream17: kept timing out if i do paths....
 AntiSquid: what language icecream17?
 icecream17: js
 Summit: Now im using codecademy
 AntiSquid: ya it's a nice language but slow compared to c++
 AntiSquid: actually icecream17 why don't you watch thibpat's stream? he streamed in JS how to get gold lol
 AntiSquid: are we losing you Summit&#160;?
 Summit: no
 FrankR: AntiSquid: you really only get multiples for paths on opponent's silence right?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: i don't handle opponent mines yet
 k4ng0u: FrankR if you don't track path precisely, you can't efficiently track mines so you are likely to surface all the time or spam silence constantly
 icecream17: each possibleOpp position = 0.01ms
 AntiSquid: i try to track them buti timeout atm
 Summit: im going to keep using this site but i need a foundation to build on 
 icecream17: with silence and paths: 128 * 16 * 0.01 &gt; 50... timeout
 Summit: i have no prior knoledge to coding
 Counterbalance: icecream17 are you using lambdas?
 icecream17: what's a lambda?
 Counterbalance:&#160;:)
 FrankR: k4ng0u: I do track, the question is why would it be better to keep track of the number of paths for each position, instead of just knowing that the enemy could be at a position or not?
 AntiSquid: icecream17 that's something you need to learn in JS
 Counterbalance: array.sort( (a, b) =&gt; a &lt; b ) etc..
 icecream17: another thing ive never heard of
 icecream17: oh, .sort()? yeah i know that...
 AntiSquid: what about ES stuff? did you learn any of that?
 icecream17: but how it relates to lambdas idk
 Counterbalance: or array.each( el =&gt; { stuff } ) - it's really slow
 icecream17: ES? also never heard of that
 AntiSquid: well lambda is just a compressed way to write functions
 icecream17: oh. yeah i know that
 AntiSquid: icecream17  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeburst.io/javascript-wtf-is-es6-es8-es-2017-ecmascript-dca859e4821c">https://codeburst.io/javascript-wtf-is-es6-es8-es-2017-ecmascript-dca859e4821c</a>
 icecream17: you mean ES5 and ES6 or stuff like that?
 AntiSquid: yes
 icecream17: ok... well i learned js like in 2018 or something so im good
 AntiSquid: ah
 Counterbalance: es6 is still not usable on all browsers&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: use a clock to check where you waste time in your code icecream17
 icecream17: var time = new Date()
 AntiSquid: edge and IE are not browsers
 icecream17: new Date() - time = 1 (millisecond)
 icecream17: Also I lose time on paths like this:
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1889ea3a-e6e6-4d3a-8a47-c281659e8d9f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1889ea3a-e6e6-4d3a-8a47-c281659e8d9f</a>
 AntiSquid: ah i see why i lose vs silver boss, he silence spams and i don't handle that correctly 
 FrankR: does anyone know a decent way to avoid/detect enemy mines?
 icecream17: And then the error stream just shows "..."
 Counterbalance: errorlogging = extremely slow in js
 icecream17: well, i could just put the time in an array but i wouldn't ever see it because it would timeout too early...
 icecream17: Maybe I could make a "setInterval" thing that displays every 5ms....
 icecream17: But usually the error stream is too clogged up to see
 AntiSquid: good question FrankR
 icecream17: How to avoid: Look at possMines. Oh 157 possMines? Maybe wait a little more... Ugh, silence. What? A mine? Let's add more positions...
 Counterbalance: yeah that about sums it up
 Nerchio: my mine problem is simply that when they put 1 mine you need to add 4
 Nerchio: and when they trigger mine you can't exactly remove 4
 Nerchio: ^^
 icecream17: I think you just avoid the general area the opponent is in by surface....
 icecream17: Trigger mine = Remove possibleOpp positions
 icecream17: Remove possibleOpp positons = Remove possibleMines
 FrankR: I'm more interested in a voronoi kind of map with high-density areas.. most just lay a minefield in one part of the map and it's way cheaper to surface than to enter that mine-hell
 k4ng0u: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/259c150f-ce82-4e20-9959-a57bbbbff337">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/259c150f-ce82-4e20-9959-a57bbbbff337</a>
 FrankR: k4ng0u I'm keeping track of the opponent's commands + possible positions. That way I can trace back paths when needed (f.ex. when a mine is triggered, I can rule out more positions/paths). However, all of that leaves way too many possible mine positions.Then again: are you saying you can successfully prune mine positions to anything meaningful? I failed to do that a few times now&#160;:(
 icecream17: I have assoc array where [position] -&gt; [possible Mines from that position]
 icecream17: When eliminate [position], eliminate [mines]
 icecream17: Usually the opponent silences too much or doesn't silence too much and you know...
 Nerchio: but 1 square can be connected to up 4 points
 icecream17: Yeah, but you're gonna avoid the general area anyway
 FrankR: icecream17 yeah I tried that.. but still even if you can trace back the correct path (assuming not even a silence) you get a mine probability of only 25%
 icecream17: avoid the general area....? add the totals up?
 k4ng0u: FrankR I can "successfully prune mine positions"  though the range is still wide because when the opp put a mine it's still a 9+6*4 potential dangerous cells. but then I still struggle to properly use that information :P for now I have some crappy heuristic to avoid those cells as much as possible but in some scenario I just go in and spam silence until I get out
 AntiSquid: ya frank same issue here, which mine do i even prune if one gets triggered and they are next to eachother&#160;:/
 icecream17: Oh. You mean if the opponent places a mine at move 17, it creates 4 positions... but when the mine blows up you only remove 1? I havent thought of that
 icecream17: handmade add up mine positions:
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/434a232b-5f66-445e-80ca-7d96a6eaeb0a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/434a232b-5f66-445e-80ca-7d96a6eaeb0a</a>
 icecream17: Try to stay in the zeroes?
 icecream17: Haven't implemented mine avoidance yet
 Counterbalance: i found a horrible bug again&#160;:(
 Counterbalance: my bot thinks it's a good idea to box itself in. It can't find the opponent then, so it thinks it's far away from it..
 Nerchio: is there ever a point staying at place #8?
 Nerchio: probably not
 icecream17: LeRenard is calculating and is 8th place in silver....
 icecream17: And all the top5 has a green up arrow
 icecream17: Including 2nd place... 0.03 behind the boss
 AntiSquid: you got a better version nerchio?
 icecream17: I wonder what the closest no-promote score is?
 Nerchio: no
 Nerchio: i feel like
 Nerchio: this game is random enough
 Nerchio: for me to advance on a good submit
 AntiSquid: try it then
 Nerchio: yea i submit when previous one finishes :D
 AntiSquid: but same bot for me can get #22, #50, #70
 Nerchio: same last time i finished 50
 Nerchio: now 8
 AntiSquid: ya maybe you won't get lucky again
 AntiSquid: just focus on improving or you waste time submitting
 Nerchio: if i submit enough times i will
 Nerchio: its statistics
 AntiSquid: then submit and improve simultaneously 
 Nerchio: dont have power to improve today anymore
 Nerchio: and tbh i am not sure what i can do anymore
 Astrobytes: LB is in constant flux during active contests, so it's obvious you'll have inconsistent results with everyone submitting, unless your bot is strong enough to cut through
 AntiSquid: as everyone improves it gets a bit harder to get past the wall that builds up close to the boss
 Nerchio: i actually think i do better vs top 10
 Nerchio: than top 30-100
 icecream17: 5 people in top 100 is computing now
 Nerchio: a couple losses against mid gold guys can slow down a submit substantialy
 Nerchio: looking decent so far
 Nerchio: a couple losses but overall many wins
 Nerchio: now the toughest region ~80
 AntiSquid: captain sonar the actual board game:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9NGY2xdP_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9NGY2xdP_8</a>
 OOOrion: There are bots in code clashs?
 Illedan: yeah
 koulick424: Hello guys
 RavenKZP: there is limit in size of code?
 icecream17: I've heard 100,000 characters or something
 RavenKZP: 98,530 :D
 RavenKZP: close&#160;:(
 RavenKZP: i mean i will need do some optimalization
 YannT: I removed 17% de of code in my  bot and now it's top10 again...
 YannT: so if you're having issues, try removing between 15% and 20% of your code
 YannT: just a protip
 Illedan: Compilation error&#160;:(
 YannT: (use cgbenchmark to figure out the magic number amount of code to remove)
 icecream17: cgbenchmark?
 Illedan: Java tool to brighten up your day
 Illedan: And run batch games to verify stuff
 trytrihjyuki: what is fastest way to get input in c++?
 YannT: trick question there's no fast way to code c++
 MadKnight: then code c#
 DHEER: where do i find the sprint coding contest?

 DHEER: ok thanks
 andichin: SIMP!
 icecream17: What's the fastest language?
 JBM: python
 JBM: well it WAS first to answer
 blasterpoard: icecream17 on codingame, c++ is probably the fastest
 blasterpoard: together with c
 Uljahn: and D perhaps
 blasterpoard: there are some who claim that D is much faster than C++, but there's still no proof
 reCurse: Good old meme
 icecream17: Count to 1000000?
 Astrobytes: D is 10 x faster than C++, they should add it to CG right now, millions will use it... oh... wait
 blasterpoard: well, D looks like it is the language with the best average rank in the contest
 blasterpoard: so those rumors might be true
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: You don't need proof when you community-spam
 blasterpoard: also C++ is bad on the top level - in legend, worst 8 players all use C++
 blasterpoard: *9
 struct: Cant argue with these facts
 Astrobytes: Shocking. Clearly D would improve this.
 Astrobytes: If everyone just takes the D, it'll all be good, right struct?
 struct: Not everyone has ability  to use D
 mviudes: hey a stupid question: if i submit one time, can i submit again?
 mviudes: is there a limit?
 struct: no limit
 Uljahn: no hard limits
 Uljahn: just don't spam submits
 mviudes: okay, thanks&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: mviudes there are people who submitted hundreds of times; but keep in mind that submitting again without significant improvement won't help you
 Astrobytes: Unless you use the D
 Astrobytes: It likes to go in frequently.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I have lowered the tone enough for tonight I think
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Goodnight all
 Counterbalance: nn

 icecream17: maybe my bot is actually good this time!
 DaniloFuchs: everyone should share their code
 DaniloFuchs: It's always puzzling to understand other people's reasoning
 icecream17: My code is useless and horrible: (first 100 lines)
 icecream17: It says "this command does not exist."
 icecream17: Oh. js comments have a slash, which are commands in cha.t.....
 icecream17: creating secret chatroom to test: #secret
 icecream17: Ah... that's how you... nice
 icecream17: Hmm. When I torpedo, the opponents silence. (Obviously not by accident). 
 icecream17: But even though I could catch the person the time of the least amount of positions is when the opponent didn't just silence
 icecream17: Hmm. If I have 1 tC, I could move and then shoot
 icecream17: The wins where I have the most lives is if my opponent walks into my mines... close combat is a close win or lose or horrible lose
 icecream17: Oh wow. I took my code and filtered out everything except [], {}, and () and got this:

 timiscoding: i've missed out on so many clashes because of the stupid security check
 Stormalix: ^
 Westicles: timiscoding, I thought you were a bot.  Why would you want to solve the same problems over and over?
 timiscoding: Westicles because they're not the same problems? 
 Westicles: There are less than a thousand, so you've cycled through them three times... 
 Westicles: Actually, that doesn't seem so bad.  From the leaderboard it looks like 5-6 times through is where the highest volume guys quit
 timiscoding: Westicles there's some problems i still haven't solved yet but you make a good point. still, racing against others is addictive..
 Westicles: No worries, seems like there are a flood of new ones these days anyhow

 MadKnight: wow there's now a room for that&#160;?
 jacek: better there than here
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we need an automatic redirection of clash links to #clash
 Automaton2000: you can try a lot of games against the boss
 Stormalix: boss?
 jacek: boss!
 Westicles: Has anyone done these jump point search puzzles?  Are they as awful as they look?

 AntiSquid: the ceiling 
 Wontonimo: same here, weird coincidence or illuminati&#160;?
 baguettes: Is there a way to get a question after submitting it?
 AntiSquid: where
 Wontonimo: in Clash of code?
 baguettes: Yes
 Wontonimo: if you remember the name you can search for it using <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 AntiSquid: nah, free masons didn't build it for me, too expensive, Wontonimo
 baguettes: Funny how I don't remember the problem name either
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: try the Activities-&gt;Practice instead. Easier to remember and it tracks the puzzles for you.  Also, they are more challenging than CoC
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a> was the first one on CodinGame that some shared with me, and it kinda got me hooked

 miejs: hi, does anyone know, if my contribution was rejected, does it reset the votes after editing it? I feel if I'd be stuck with a negative rating after editing my contribution, I should just create a new one instead..
 Wontonimo: don't know about rejected.  If it expires the votes stay but the approvals go away
 miejs: that part makes sense, thanks

 baguettes: Huh
 baguettes: Website slow
 Lobster_Speed: yeah website is also shit water
 Lobster_Speed: Like instead of fixing their site they decide to launch a new site 
 Lobster_Speed: like wtf
 TimV13-BBG-: make one yourself then
 Lobster_Speed:&#160;??
 TimV13-BBG-: and try to let thousands of people use it
 TimV13-BBG-: without it breaking
 Lobster_Speed: that isn't what I am saying 
 Lobster_Speed: I love Coding game
 Lobster_Speed: But they can't just abandon it out of nowheree
 TimV13-BBG-: well it sounds like you're just trash talking their website
 Lobster_Speed: No I am talking trash about them leaving this site to make a new one, without fixing the bugs on this site
 MSmits: what new site?
 TimV13-BBG-: sometimes that's the better option
 Lobster_Speed: coding escape
 Lobster_Speed: its not even fun
 MSmits: that is really meant to replace codingame.com I think&#160;?
 MSmits: is not
 Lobster_Speed: not it isn't supposed to replace it
 Lobster_Speed: It isn't fun because they basically took the challenges on coding game, over there and tried to make it a team game, which makes no sense
 MSmits: you are making an assumption though, that they make a decision to shift resources away from CG to this other site and leaving problems unfixed. 
 MSmits: it might be completely different teams
 MSmits: and the problems on CG might be hard to fix
 MSmits: which is why it takes so long
 Lobster_Speed: Then why did they say it was fixed tho
 MSmits: no idea, i didnt follow it closely. Maybe they thought it was
 TimV13-BBG-: stop complaining and make do it better yourself. they're doing their best to make something for people out there
 Lobster_Speed: dude your arguement is making no sense right now I'm saying why did they launch new site knowing that old site isn't working 
 MSmits: from what i know of CG, bad issues like the current ones do usually get fixed asap. Its mostly little issues that get put on hold for  along time
 MSmits: it's better to go on the forum and make a post, first checking whether someone else hasnt already
 MSmits: just report the problem and see what they say
 MSmits: another thing: Enjoy somethign other than clashes and short puzzles. Longer problems and bots and such can easily be done offline. You dont need the site to be working 24/7 for that
 MSmits: i am currently working on a bot and i can just keep coding, even if i cant test it yet
 Lobster_Speed: yeah they said they know and are currently working on it 
 MSmits: ah ok, well all we can do is wait then&#160;:)
 MSmits: Lobster_Speed what kind of things do you do on CG?
 AntiSquid: idk, it's their internal business decision so ...on the other hand lots of people said they'd pay a premium for faster submits :D
 MSmits: I would not mind some kind of premium membership but it's dangerous. It also scares some people off if they perceive unfair advantages to paying players
 MSmits: faster submits is one of those dangerous things
 AntiSquid: anyone else getting "Gateway Timeout" red message at random?
 MSmits: yeah part of the problem I guess
 2StepsFr0mHell: I don't see the link between us pushing the Coding Escape (which will be eventually on CG) and the current bug, linked to a prior release this afternoon Lobster_Speed&#160;?
 2StepsFr0mHell: wups wrong account
 [CG]Thibaud: here you go
 jacek: oO
 AntiSquid: one of them is the evil twin
 [CG]Thibaud: it was my account before I joined CG. Should have reused it
 [CG]Thibaud: now it serves as a test account
 AntiSquid: damn tab crashed again with gateway error message
 reCurse: Oh dear the APIs
 MSmits: :monkey:
 reCurse: Also don't feed the trolls Thibaud :P
 AntiSquid: the guy was just a bit frustrated
 darkhorse64: harsh comments based on clueless assumptions -&gt; alternate realities
 AntiSquid: the part i found weird was "why doesn't CG things the way i think it's best?" 
 AntiSquid: do things *
 darkhorse64: Why weird&#160;?
 reCurse: Oh if it was just that...
 darkhorse64: It's consistent with his other statements
 reCurse: My clasher radar is also scarily accurate
 HunterEhrenfeld: i hate react
 AntiSquid: too much self-importance
 AntiSquid: why doesn't x do what i think is best, because ...
 struct: I wonder what the release was :thinking:
 AntiSquid: try one of the alternatives HunterEhrenfeld
 AntiSquid: wouldn't recommend angular though
 reCurse: I think it's time to write an anti smits script
 struct: o.o
 reCurse: Trigger resubmit when he resubmits uttt
 struct: So many red arrows on top 10
 struct: What are you doing MSmits?
 AntiSquid: optimizing to the leaderboard
 reCurse: MSgiri
 Wontonimo: yesterday I wasn't going to complain because MSmits pushed me up 10 positions, but now that he has pushed me down 1 I have to protest! lol
 HunterEhrenfeld: AntiSquid, i have to use it because its the requirement for my university project
 AntiSquid: send him angry emotes in private, that will teach him, Wontonimo
 HunterEhrenfeld: anyone have a favorite bot programming activity?
 AntiSquid: it's not so bad compared to the others imo HunterEhrenfeld
 HunterEhrenfeld: its not, i just dont like js in general lmao
 AntiSquid: don't understand the last question
 reCurse: Don't we all
 AntiSquid: ah you're one of those people, nvm then HunterEhrenfeld
 MSmits: just testing some new stuff Wontonimo&#160;:)
 reCurse: You'd have more reliable results benching instead, just saying :p
 MSmits: i am not benching
 MSmits: when i submit its to test bugs
 MSmits: i can get a lot of games quick with a submit
 reCurse: I see
 MSmits: and easy to view as well
 MSmits: a lot of what i did these last few months is improving solver, so what i do is check my "WIN" "LOSS" output to see if it's consistent
 reCurse: My performance improved disabling the solver, not sure what's up with that
 MSmits: well, you dont have a lot of rollout so I'm not sure how much a solver would help you
 MSmits: how it would hurt you, i have no clue
 reCurse: With tree reuse and accurate move prediction it can accumulate quite a bit over time
 MSmits: sure yeah, i suspect 7-8 plies deep or so
 MSmits: but if your eval is good, it may not affect WR
 reCurse: I'm suspecting it has either more to do with draws, or the impact of a terminal visited normally on the scoring
 reCurse: It's really tricky
 reCurse: Not satisfied with the answers of the paper on how to address it either
 MSmits: might be different for a low rollout bot though. I guess the rest of us also have problems with draws, but because there are so many rollouts, it gets drowned out
 reCurse: That's the thing, I think it may miss out on draws because of how it handles them, hence lower perf
 MSmits: i tried selecting solved draws normally and backpropagating, didnt realyl matter
 reCurse: It might still way underevaluate a node even if it could draw
 reCurse: So it misses an opportunity not to lose
 jacek: draws are so tricky
 karliso: CGbench stopped working for me although IDE works: "FATAL Error while retrieving account cookie and session"
 reCurse: Yeah CG updated their APIs, I notified Neumann with the fix
 karliso: oh
 deoignition: bro im sorry but python is ass #nofilter
 jacek: oO
 ButIMNotACoder: can some one teach me competetive prog
 ButIMNotACoder: competitve
 Wontonimo: reCurse are you indexing/hashing boards and if so how?  (you said you are reusing them). I'm considering a custom hash
 Wontonimo: i'm looking at unordered_map or just a static array
 MSmits: Wontonimo are you talkng about uttt?
 Wontonimo: indeed
 Wontonimo: one track mind
 MSmits: it's not worth it to hash for mcts in almost every game, maybe every game. For UTTT it's not even worth it for minimax
 MSmits: reCurse is definitely not hashing
 Wontonimo: ah, thanks MSmits&#160;!
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: i just tried this btw, just for lategame states
 AntiSquid: butimnotacoder already offline lol, was about to share the answer to his question and the many mysteries of the universe
 MSmits: because you can have a lot of transpositions with finished boards 
 MSmits: but it wasnt worth it even then
 MSmits: also: Static array generally works best if you dont mind losing some states. That's what i do for minimax
 MSmits: unordered_map/set is nice for when you need to be 100% sure every state is saved
 MSmits: (but is not the fastest possible implementation that I've heard about)
 Wontonimo: i'm sitting at 53rd and I've run out of bullets for optimizing hyperparameters and my current architecture.  I ask about the hashing because i've only got 2 ideas for next steps&#160;: rave or RL
 MSmits: there are probabyl many other things you can try. I bet I can find at least 3 you havent tried
 MSmits: did you try doing something with avoiding givign away free moves in selection?
 jacek: i havent tried but id say rave wont work
 MSmits: like applying a uct penalty
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: also there's teccles
 MSmits: you can do it in expansion to avoid searching other moves
 MSmits: narrows the search
 MSmits: also do mcts solver if you havent
 jacek: msmits why so low
 MSmits: just submitted a bugged bot
 MSmits: i dont care what my rank is while working on it :0
 Wontonimo: teccles?
 MSmits: how can that be new to you&#160;? :P
 MSmits: allright, check any game between top players
 MSmits: and see what player 1 is doing
 MSmits: it's very easy to spot
 MSmits: mine is hardcoded to do it, re curse NN just does it by training
 MSmits: it emerged from training i mean
 Wontonimo: oh, right, yeah the first play in square thing.   I notied that a while ago
 MSmits: well you can force your bot to do it
 MSmits: but you can go further
 MSmits: you can also do your expansion such that it only allows that 1 move
 MSmits: having no branching
 MSmits: you can get deeper that way
 MSmits: it's not 100% always the best move, but close enough, especially  &lt; ply 20
 Wontonimo: right
 MSmits: and do the solver, it's quite impressive how well a mcts can solve. 
 Wontonimo: funny, i used to have the teccle (sp?) thing in my silver bot.
 MSmits: teccles is a top 20 player, he first advertised this move (probably was known long before)
 Wontonimo: ah
 MSmits: but he talked about it in chat. Eyeopener for many players
 MSmits: uttt doesnt have a lot of very succesful heuristics. This is an exception
 Wontonimo: that's why google had nsfw results for teccles ... 
 MSmits: lol
 Wontonimo: thought i was being trolled
 AntiSquid: there's an online "solution" of how to win as player one (slightly different uttt version) which uses some similar move, maybe he got inspiration from there
 MSmits: thats really funny
 MSmits: i never googled teccles
 MSmits: i dont get nsfw stuff
 AntiSquid: not getting any nsfw stuff either
 MSmits: maybe google just thinks you have different preferences :P
 AntiSquid: and i have show sensitive content on
 Wontonimo: you don't understand it or people just dont send you n*d*s?
 AntiSquid: google does show different results based on location 
 MSmits: they dont send me any of that Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: maybe i shouldn't search in my basement bathroom
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: is it like one of those london underground basements?
 Wontonimo: i wouldn't know, but if the london underground basements are like mine, then I'll pass and them them to have their teens clean it up
 AntiSquid: google: luxury london basements
 Wontonimo: those toilets are as large as swimming pools&#160;!

 Wontonimo: oh, i'm using 8% of my time on delete
 struct: delete?
 Wontonimo: 8% - MCTS::~MCTS()
 MSmits: why delete anything?
 Wontonimo: i'm asking myself that same thing
 MSmits: smart question
 Wontonimo: Memory Leaks for the Win!  
 MSmits: you dont use object pools?
 Wontonimo: no.  i've been reading about it
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 35000000;
 MSmits: Node nodes[NODE_MAX];
 MSmits: easy
 MSmits: Node* root = nodes;
 MSmits: int nodeIndex = 1;
 MSmits: (0 = root)
 struct: Do you even get close to 35'000'000?
 Wontonimo: oh.  hmm... i was thinking id have to deal with delete and clean up, but since delete is not needed, then yes, make make a good point that it is easy
 MSmits: struct yeah, for some versions of my bot i need to reset
 uvaishzafri: don't online communities feel dark and lonely?
 MSmits: use a different skin uvaishzafri
 MSmits: dark is better on the eyes
 MSmits: but if it makes you lonely, use light skin
 uvaishzafri: i mean a dark world, away from reality.
 MSmits: yeah, keep it light
 uvaishzafri: feels like a different world is going on
 MSmits: :flashlight:
 uvaishzafri: lol, dude
 MSmits: I know what you need
 MSmits: :smile_cat:

 uvaishzafri: hahaha you fell in the trap, i am a bot!

 Scarfield: Automatons assemble!
 AntiSquid: so? just have to make bots more human-like
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 already has feelings
 Automaton2000: and what's the problem with that?
 MSmits: :robot: :arrow_right: :walking:
 AntiSquid: no problem, we are all equal bots and humans
 MSmits: I think some are more equal than others
 AntiSquid: like Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN&#160;?
 Automaton2000: yeah i think so too
 Scarfield: :o
 MSmits: thats proof, he's thinking!
 MSmits: he said so!

 Wontonimo: you spit facts
 Wontonimo: not to be confused with speaking moistly

 MSmits: you are both Canadian :P
 Astrobytes: I keep my mask on to prevent me speaking moistly to people.
 Astrobytes: *prevent me from

 jacek: why russians are so obsessed with uttt

 reCurse: To be fair the chat here has also been dominated by uttt for the past month 
 Wontonimo: that's my focus for this month.  next month i'm on to something else ... i've got only a few days left on uttt
 jacek: why would you choose february for uttt
 reCurse: Least days
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Wontonimo: it's already the most depressing month ... why not double it&#160;?

 MadKnight: putin bad AutomatonRU good, remember that Automaton2000
 AntiSquid: but some guy on a keto-diet channel (youtube) said volcanic salt is good for you @[RAINBOW]BlaiseEbuth
 Automaton2000: has anyone done the chuck norris puzzle
 jacek: hm
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 coming up with jokes is hard
 Automaton2000: and tell me if i'm wrong
 [RAINBOW]BlaiseEbuth: Meh, after 3 days I'm already tired to fake I'm a kind guy...
 Astrobytes: I'm sorely disappointed in you for even trying to pretend.
 MadKnight: stop faking it lol, just accept it that u are an abuser and an oppressor of the minorities
 MadKnight: or are u not? 
 MadKnight: CRINGE
 Astrobytes: you high?
 AntiSquid: here's the channel can't find the video, but he bought some really expensive salt <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimalEdgeHealth/search?query=salt">https://www.youtube.com/c/PrimalEdgeHealth/search?query=salt</a>  if you're curious
 MadKnight: yes
 MadKnight: no
 MadKnight: in russia it's pretty normal to joke about being an abuser Astrobytes (just to troll some people)
 AntiSquid: ya different cultures . different strokes for different folks 
 MadKnight: true, how did some cultures come to "white bad / black good"&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's not start that topic her
 MadKnight: e
 Automaton2000: u should make a game where you can go back to your old code
 Astrobytes: Will you stop pinging that damn bot
 MadKnight: i need to talk to him
 MadKnight: lol
 Wontonimo: we need a dedicated channel for that 
 [RAINBOW]BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes, you're totally right... I will stop that now.
 Astrobytes: [RAINBOW]BlaiseEbuth: good
 MadKnight: then remove rainbow and all that kind of stuff from your profile lol
 MadKnight: he actually put that stuff into his profile? not as a joke? Automaton2000 it's too awkward
 AntiSquid: MadKnight you realize this is the same phase cyberpunk went through at the end right? he kept pinging the bots and spamming chat even talking to himself
 Automaton2000: i got an idea for a multi
 MadKnight: AntiSquid that wasn't his problem
 AntiSquid: but it was a symptom 
 MadKnight: u can't prove that it's an actual proof 
 MadKnight: stop doing proofs Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what do you do when you have no idea how to play it a lot
 AntiSquid: see&#160;? now you're engaging in a pointless polemic trying to reason your actions ..
 MadKnight: he wasn't doing that
 MadKnight: anyway, where is he? last time i saw him was in that website for chess
 AntiSquid: and before you know it you start blocking people with a script
 AntiSquid: idk maybe still on lichess&#160;?
 MadKnight: we can check
 AntiSquid: if you see him, remind him i won our chess game
 MadKnight: nono me i'm not gonna check it 
 MadKnight: at least soon
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 help us check it
 Automaton2000: but once you get used to the game
 reCurse: I mean you're talking with someone having 'mad' is in name and not expecting someone rambling to himself with a bot
 jacek: oh, fireworks puzzle of the week
 reCurse: *in his
 MadKnight: i made that nickname when i was a child cmon
 reCurse: Regarding to bot usage it's hard to see the difference
 AntiSquid: your younger self would tell you to fix your CSB MadKnight
 MadKnight: i'm just not experienced in being a social guy
 MadKnight: i've been coding for too much
 reCurse: Training with automaton will only make things worse
 MadKnight: i actually need a whole new approach 
 MadKnight: well okay i'll try to find a better way
 MadKnight: AntiSquid exactly
 MadKnight: but that wasn't 'mad'
 MadKnight: it was like 2014-2015
 MadKnight: i remember exactly when and exactly for what i made that nickname
 MadKnight: and it was 2014-2015
 AntiSquid: maybe you should go out if lockdown stopped in your country
 MadKnight: i do but i need like everyday go-out's
 AntiSquid: find a mad dame or something
 MadKnight: in russia it's like entirely finished unless u are 65+
 MadKnight: u can even visit some shops without a mask
 AntiSquid: in uk too, they call it the great reopening, you tend to get unwanted company though
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: why?
 AntiSquid: because someone calls police on you
 MadKnight: but why
 MadKnight: if it's a reopening
 AntiSquid: it's official lol
 MadKnight: sounds like it should make everything opened
 MadKnight: so why the police&#160;?
 AntiSquid: "official" ... boris introduced today his 4 step plan and by june we might be fully over with the lockdown
 AntiSquid: why the police? because people like to report you for whatever 
 MadKnight: just say "hi" to them 
 MadKnight: and then "bye"
 MadKnight: anyway
 AntiSquid: saw some videos people getting into long legal arguments
 MadKnight: now i'm trying to improve my tone of how i speak
 MadKnight: it was just absolutely terrible
 MadKnight: the tone 
 MadKnight: playing a game with this dude daily
 AntiSquid: so did you decide which regional accent / pronunciation you want to use&#160;?
 MadKnight: he suggested a few nice games
 MadKnight: AntiSquid like for sure not a new york'ers accent
 MadKnight: did i even spell that right&#160;?
 MadKnight: anyway i didn't mean an eng accent tone thingy, i meant like in general
 AntiSquid: new yoker's
 MadKnight: sounds like a rap
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 we need a beat to that
 Automaton2000: but is that the only thing that could be used in the next few days
 AntiSquid: yorker's * lol sry 
 AntiSquid: how about yolker&#160;? 
 MadKnight: naa i prefer workers
 MadKnight: hmm i'm kinda tired
 AntiSquid: of what? too much typing?
 MadKnight: of being awake for too long lol
 MadKnight: i just feel like i'm losing my ability to think because of that
 AntiSquid: did you pull an all nighter&#160;?
 MadKnight: hmmm more like double all nighter
 MadKnight: i don't remember sleeping last night or since then
 AntiSquid: woah&#160;! go sleep 
 AntiSquid: did you start seeing things yet from lack of sleep&#160;?
 MadKnight: no lol it's actually really far from that
 MadKnight: i need like 3 more nights after this one for that
 MadKnight: i dunno actually
 MadKnight: anyway let's just talk about some code
 MadKnight: so we've been discussing some WW in #ru
 AntiSquid: sure do puzzle of the week: fireworks
 MadKnight: my 3yo WW bot is kinda bad
 MadKnight: just a bit
 AntiSquid: it's derived from a jap game named hanabi
 AntiSquid: and the bot version is a lot less fun than the real life card game
 AntiSquid: and the inputs could have been made easier / more appealing
 MadKnight: no i only like doing puzzles when i can solve them with my fancy library that is so universal that it can solve literally everything similar
 AntiSquid: it's a multi
 AntiSquid: co-op multi, works same way as code a la mode in that regard
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: It was in WIP for several months, you could have provided feedback at the time
 AntiSquid: i was giving feedback on some stuff, he didn't appreciate it and i moved on to do other stuff
 MadKnight: hey reCurse an actual question
 MadKnight: any info on your uTTT bot&#160;?
 MadKnight: so i made a MCTS with 60k sims and i dunno where to go next after that
 AntiSquid: ping MSmits about that MadKnight
 Astrobytes: Or just get some sleep.
 MadKnight: hmmm i think he's sleeping now
 MSmits: nope, but soon going to
 MadKnight: oh
 Astrobytes: Now, for sure.
 MadKnight: me and some people in #ru were asking for some hints for uTTT
 AntiSquid: shadow people are real, if you don't believe me skip a few more nights of sleep you'll see them&#160;! 
 MadKnight: got any&#160;?
 MSmits: not really. yurko more or less knows what i know
 MSmits: so ask him 
 MadKnight: but u know more than me for sure
 Astrobytes: Yeah, 3+ days and you'll get shadow people
 MSmits: thats true
 MadKnight: so that's why i'm asking
 MSmits: you're seriously going to work on uttt then?
 MadKnight: first WW
 MadKnight: a dude is waiting for me to improve it
 MSmits: ok, i'd say implement teccles first
 Astrobytes: Better here in World at least, rather than endless DMs
 MSmits: get back to me once you've done tha
 MadKnight: welll
 MSmits: teccles is like -3vel for uttt :P
 MadKnight: now i just gotta do it lol
 MSmits: yep
 AntiSquid: first you grab tickle's cat, get its DNA and convert it to bits
 MadKnight: "get its DNA and stuff"&#160;? sounds too easy
 MSmits: did you write this anywhere else AntiSquid, I am starting to wonder why Wontonimo gets nsfw results
 AntiSquid: i'll see myself out, got stuff to do
 MadKnight: how can results be nsfw lol
 Astrobytes: yeah what was all that about, I just got some random stuff and a pic of teccles himself
 MSmits: no idea 
 Astrobytes: (Teccles the cat that is)
 MSmits: maybe he mistyped it
 MadKnight: it can't just be a bad number it's gotta be something more fancdy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits did u use 49 bits on connect4?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for the board

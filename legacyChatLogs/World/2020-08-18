 markyy: when do I lose points
 Allis: Any time you lose, I think?
 jrke: when you lose any clash you will lose points and if you win then you gain points
 markyy: does losing mean not being in the first place?
 Allis: I think it'd be better if it were the TrueSkill of whom you beat minus the TS of whom you lost to, but that doesn't seem to be the case.
 zile151: "Unbalanced games, for example, result in either negligible updates when the favorite wins, or huge updates when the favorite loses surprisingly." 
 zile151: So it does depend on who you beat, but a loss always decreases your rating
 markyy: do I always lose points if not in the first place?
 jrke: no 
 jrke: maybe if you are below total players in clash/2
 Rogogomogofl: Guys, how to enable the QUEST MAP display on the home tab?
 zile151: "we’ve released a first version of the quest map (new home page) for all users until now. (all new users will have it or not according to a A/B test)."
 zile151: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/quest-map-new-home-page-feedbacks-bugs/185603">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/quest-map-new-home-page-feedbacks-bugs/185603</a>
 zile151: so maybe you got unlucky with the randomization
 Vin_Wang_: this platform is fun
 ripcode: whats up fellas
 tutubalin: Without A/B test I can say that quest map is a great feature and really helps new users to explore vast possibilities of CG
 tutubalin: I'm not so new user, but quest map teased me to Optimization section which I have been ignoring for a long time
 jacek: and apparently quest map made clash haters do some clashes
 wlesavo: that was the most amusing part of quest map
 Gorbit99: I would love to see some stats about coc plays after the quest map was released
 [CG]Thibaud: we've just removed the A/B testing on home page FYI
 DomiKo: top3 :grin:
 tutubalin: :thumbsup:
 jrke: nice work in samegame DomiKo
 jrke: :thumbs_up:
 FinnWerner: :v:
 DomiKo: got 3639 in case12 :D
 jacek: good for you
 MSmits: nice one
 inoryy: what's the website with CG logs again? I really should bookmark it..
 Gorbit99: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page</a>
 inoryy: thanks
 Tiramon: what kind of almost blank wiki is that ... and what are the usefull informations on that page?
 Tiramon: most usefull part i see it the list of tools
 Agade: Someone started a wiki? Nice
 inoryy: well from my question it's kind of easy infer website's main use :P
 ruasd: hi guys&#160;!!
 Gorbit99: hey
 ruasd: i want to set up a website
 Gorbit99: Tiramon as far as I understand, it's a searchable chat log
 ruasd: do anyone want to help&#160;?
 Tiramon: don't see any logs on that page ...
 Tiramon: oh yes found the link on that page
 Tiramon: and Gorbit99 i wasn't wondering on the stuff linked on that wiki ... just about that wiki
 Tiramon: wow that really has some content of logs
 IgnacioGb: hi, is there any way to do block comment in python?
 jacek: put in """ """
 jacek: 3x "
 IgnacioGb: haha thanks
 IgnacioGb: oh i just discovered it
 IgnacioGb: ctl + #
 IgnacioGb: or ctl + ç idk i have german keyboard
 euneun: hi
 Gorbit99: hey
 Tiramon: ok guess that should be enough for wood 1 in coders of the realm 1v1
 Gorbit99: this dots and boxes game is fun
 jacek: using any search yet?
 Gorbit99: just a simple "if this box has 2 edges, avoid it like the plague, if it has 1, fill the remaining, otherwise, just choose at random"
 Gorbit99: but this seems effective
 jacek: so do i
 Gorbit99: only got 2 second places sofar
 Gorbit99: both from you
 Gorbit99: ok, now I got one from the boss
 Gorbit99: got a promotion too
 jacek: \o/
 Gorbit99: at 2x2, it's not really a real challenge, more like random luck
 Gorbit99: jesus, wood 1 is a big stepup
 jacek: and of course tric is 1st
 Gorbit99: ofc
 Gorbit99: let's see where this bot puts me in wood 1
 Gorbit99: seems to be in the middle
 Gorbit99: as I see it, what you really want is one of two scenarios, if it will be your turn when all the boxes have 2 edges, then you want a closed off area of 1 tile, or at least an area with less possible boxes than another one, so you can put in a line there and the enemy then needs to put one inside the larger area, making you win
 Gorbit99: but if it's your enemy's turn, you want the exact opposite, possibly just one gigantic section
 JJJJJJtendingtoinfinite: neymar
 Tiramon: oh it's really called dots and boxes ... just wanted to ask what game you are talking about&#160;;)didn't knwo the english name for that game
 jrke: where can i find D&amp;B refree?
 Gorbit99: I assume inside the zip
 Gorbit99: where it was submitted
 dbdr: would be nicer to have a public repo
 jrke: ^Yeah
 jacek: and reveal the boss?
 jrke: Then it will easier&#160;;)
 jrke: will be easier*
 Gorbit99: The boss is in there afaik
 Tiramon: and yes wood 2 isn't that hard even with doing stupid moves because i don't watch neighbour boxes
 jrke: i don't know why when i remove one bug i gives me bad result&#160;:(
 jrke: hey tiramon welcome in wood 1
 Tiramon: yeah ... now i'm punished for ignoring the state of neighbour boxes ...
 Gorbit99: oh right
 Gorbit99: that's my issue
 Gorbit99: thanks tiramon
 jrke: im also punished
 Tiramon: still a good score for ignoring that&#160;;)
 Tiramon: hm that looks like a fun game to train a NN for ... but i guess the weights will be to much for CGs limit
 jacek: NNs eh
 AntiSquid: how's your machine learning journey going Tiramon&#160;?
 jrke: can you tell me what Nueral networking do?
 Tiramon: finished my udacity course .. but got distracted by other stuff
 Tiramon: jrke .. atleast you got a positive score
 AntiSquid: jrke imagine a polynomial math function ...
 AntiSquid: you try to find a function that predicts what you want to know
 jrke: Tiramon when i entered wood 1 my first submission ended at -4.5
 Tiramon: and you form that function like you train your brain by positive and negative feedback to the algo
 jrke: so it trains our algo that what is working good or bad
 Tiramon: you try to create a polynomal function to approximate if a game state is a good or a bad stateso you can really fast choose which action to take next
 jrke: ok
 Tiramon: and you got an algo to do so ... thats the NN
 Tiramon: training takes foreverusing a trained NN is fast as hell
 mesavitae: Anyone else finished the Flood Fill Example puzzle, and believe the rules are contrary to what is happening?
 Uljahn: how so?
 mesavitae: well i misread one part thought it said it couldn't have the same IDs, but the last puzzle did. 
 mesavitae: 1. Each tower has an I.D., which is not '#', '.' or '+'.So first rule implies + is not a tower, but then later you're expected to treat it as a tower and to flood the map with it
 Tiramon: ok simple 'don't do shit in neigbours' should be done
 Tiramon: definitely better
 MSmits: ... lawn?
 MSmits: ... car?
 MSmits: what are you not :poop: ing in Tiramon?
 wlesavo: MSmits new multi, or an old one i never saw, dots and boxes
 MSmits: is that Sokoban? 
 MSmits: oh 
 MSmits: that one
 MSmits: kamertje verhuren
 MSmits: I know the game
 wlesavo:  la pipopipette
 MSmits: that's gross wlesavo
 Astrobytes: In this instance I have to say the French sounds better than the Dutch :P
 MSmits: the Dutch name translates to renting rooms
 MSmits: I would enjoy this game, but work to do unfortunately&#160;:(
 MSmits: Have to prepare classes and such
 Astrobytes: Plenty time!Oh you're back full-time now
 MSmits: hardly full time, but yeah in the sense that all classes are physical
 Astrobytes: You have my condolences, I don't agree with the situation at all
 MSmits: thanks, we'll see what happens
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 MSmits: I'll refer to story of 2 guys running away from a bear
 MSmits: if you know it
 Astrobytes: The old kids fable?
 MSmits: One guy says: "We'll never outrun this bear". Other guy says: I don't have to, I just have to outrun you"
 Astrobytes: Oh, different one
 Astrobytes: Quite
 MSmits: so I don't have to avoid getting infected
 MSmits: I have to avoid getting infected before others and the school closes again
 wlesavo: lol
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's the only way to play it.
 COdeC: same here in secondary school lol
 MSmits: of course there is the hope that it goes well, but I just don't see it
 wlesavo: we will never out run the bats
 Astrobytes: I can't see it either.
 MSmits: I don't blame my school btw, they do what they can
 MSmits: i blame a combination of dumb fellow Dutch people and the governments handling of this part of the pandemic
 MSmits: they did ok before, but I think they made a mistake now
 Astrobytes: No it's government to blame
 Astrobytes: Yes, and the general public too.
 Washier: Today is the first day you can legally buy(sell) cigarettes(tobaco products) in South Africa since March 23. A lot of people were angry, even non smokers complained because loss of income. Think most governments are going to make mistakes in this whole thing. Europe not that bad a place to be me thinks
 Tiramon: covid is the cause they blocked selling cigarettes&#160;?
 Washier: yes.
 dbdr: if people stopped smoking for 5 months, aren't they most delivered of the addiction by now?
 Washier: Our govt decided it increases your risk
 Washier: no, the illegal market flourished. prices were high tho
 Tiramon: trumps bleach idead was worse ... but not by much ...
 DomiKo: There is bug in description in Dots and Boxes. "string playerId; // The ID of the player. 0=first player, 1=second player."
 DomiKo: but Id is A or B&#160;:(
 dbdr: I think it's true that smoking does inscrease the risk of transmission
 dbdr: the decision is still a question of course
 dbdr: some countries ban public smoking
 Washier: probably does. but our neighbours Botswana was the only other country in the world that also banned it. rest of the smoking world disagreed
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53763267">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53763267</a>
 dbdr: spanish region banned it too
 dbdr: probably others, was the first hit
 Washier: that's smoking in public places. also not allowed here for years. we banned cigarettes. you were not allowed to buy them. black market exploded.
 dbdr: including the street
 dbdr: but yes, different from banning in your own homes
 MSmits: if you've already wanted to quit for years but didnt manage to, a ban like that can do the trick for you
 Washier: street no, but of course that's hard to enforce here. restaurants, malls, any building, not allowed to smoke here. i smoked in an Egyptian airport once, security said it was ok.
 MSmits: people who really want to quit, are not going to go through the trouble of black markets
 Washier: MSmits, you are right. But if you've ever been addicted to the sutff you would not say that
 MSmits: many people I know have been addicted and stopped
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a tough one to kick.
 MSmits: all it takes is a strong enough motivation
 Astrobytes: Only vaping helped me. 
 MSmits: a ban to make it illegal might increase motivation enough to quit
 MSmits: for some
 Astrobytes: No. Bans create black markets. Prohibition is rarely suitable.
 MSmits: of course they do, and they create crime too
 dbdr: I think ban in public places is a good compromise
 Washier: ok, sorry, with black market i should add, i bought mine in the parking lot at the shops. most people did. took the market about 1 month to develop, in which time I nearly quit. but alas. 
 MSmits: but that doesnt mean there arent less people addicted
 dbdr: dutch guy advocating banning of a drug, he orinoy&#160;;)
 MSmits: smoking is already on the decline
 Washier: its a stupid ban. should add alcahol was also banned. but most people agree with that.
 Astrobytes: There's been a cigarette black market like that in the UK for years. They put the prices up of real cigs and everyone buys the ones from under the counter instead
 dbdr: *the irony
 MSmits: I'm not advocating for it dbdr, i think banning is a bad idea
 MSmits: I am just discussing the consequences
 Washier: of course everyone skips the sin tax.
 MSmits: and I think one of them is reduced number of smokers
 Washier: so govt loses billions
 dbdr: right, just teasing
 MSmits: kk&#160;:)
 Washier: original thread was govts handling it baad. i wanted to assure people my govt is way up there&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: my government is actually handling it quite well mostly
 MSmits: listening to science
 Washier: very
 Washier: yes.
 Astrobytes: Oh Washier, will send you some metal with great drums later btw&#160;;)
 Washier: our govt cited non peered reviewed studies to support smoke ban
 Washier: will do 'stro
 MSmits: remember when smoking companies would do the opposite?
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 MSmits: citing non peer reviewed studies to support that smoking is healthy, studies done by scientists on their payroll
 MSmits: payback is a ...
 dbdr: pretty sure paid scientists also reviewed...
 Astrobytes: Still happens with big pharma drug trials
 MSmits: lol, well thats worse dbdr
 dbdr: then that business inspired and moved to keeping some doubt over climate change
 Astrobytes: ^
 Washier: &lt;brain explodes&gt;
 MSmits: seems to me that branch is now redundant
 MSmits: politicians dont need proof of anything anymore
 Washier: very true
 Astrobytes: I think they moved on to 'causes of climate change'
 dbdr: this is a good read if you have the time: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html</a>also beautiful presentation
 Astrobytes: saved for later
 MSmits: same
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: Currently prepping for an MHRA inspection
 Washier: good luck
 Astrobytes: Should be fine. Only GDP and the client is in good shape. Just gotta make sure all the i's and t's are dotted and crossed so to speak.
 Gorbit99: damn, this bf pow is very limiting, no wrapping and modulo 256?
 JBM: not even modulo
 JBM: then again you're only asked to implement, not to code with it
 Gorbit99: thankfully
 JBM: so it's not as much of hindrance as it appears at first sight
 Gorbit99: well, right here it's just a check
 Gorbit99: welp, got it
 KyawMyotun: how to find racetrack
 KyawMyotun: wrong chat

 sparky: :fearful:
 Gorbit99: when you code it
 sparky: you just have to take the king in the past, or in a parallel universe, or something..
 Gorbit99: I mean, codewise, I doubt it's that different, because it's literally just 2 more dimensions
 reCurse: Would be more interesting to add a 960 + bughouse variation instead IMO. Beats opening book and reusing existing engines/evals (probably)
 reCurse: Oops I meant crazyhouse
 sparky: yeah, also suicide chess
 reCurse: I find it boring :p
 jacek: so... shogi?
 reCurse: Slightly inspired yes but still more related to chess.
 reCurse: Still familiar but with very different execution
 reCurse: And gives a whole new meaning to trades
 reCurse: More complexification than simplification&#160;:)
 jacek: how long typical game lasts though
 reCurse: Likely under 200 turns per player
 reCurse: Or whatever the limitation is, I forgot
 reCurse: Looking at games of top players on chess.com games, duration seems similar to regular games, maybe even shorter
 Astrobytes: struct was gonna do 960 at one point but promptly disappeared instead
 reCurse: I think 960 doesn't solve reusing the existing theory/evaluation
 reCurse: Crazyhouse however I think remains underexplored in comparison
 reCurse: So combining both? Yes please
 Astrobytes: Sounds interesting for sure
 eulerscheZahl: where is my struct? :sob:
 Illedan: Deleted again?
 jacek: not in java, thats for sure
 eulerscheZahl: no, just ghosting
 AntiSquid: just tried bughouse, i hate it .
 AntiSquid: pawn dropped out of nowhere onto the board 
 AntiSquid: check the king and once i move king i lose knight ... wow
 jacek: you should anticipate deeper
 AntiSquid: kind of lame, you can just drop anywhere a piece, any time
 Andriamanitra: well no
 Andriamanitra: there's strategy behind it, you don't want to give your opponent pieces to drop
 AntiSquid: lost 1, won 1, still lame&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: maybe it's ok for bot games
 jacek: so you wouldnt like shogi would you
 AntiSquid: the 2v2 makes it kind of random imo
 Laminator: dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies. Screw that reverse 
 Gorbit99: AntiSquid it quickly changes, if it makes it better?
 Gorbit99: -?
 Gorbit99: oh, that was an hour ago
 Zm4j: hello, I am not experienced with this site, can someone tell what does this message mean.Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 Gorbit99: every game turn you get input
 Gorbit99: this means you haven't read it all
 Zm4j: in the game i am solving now, in game loop there is just one input and that is in the first 2 lines, why does it not read it all?
 Gorbit99: which game?
 Zm4j: skynet revolution e1
 Gorbit99: have you read everything before that too?
 Zm4j: i did, I saved it all in an array and then worked with it
 Zm4j: test 1 works fine
 Zm4j: second one passes but i get this message
 Gorbit99: make sure you don't accidentally print more than 1 thing at once
 Gorbit99: and that you haven't deleted the STDIN syncing line, if there was one
 Zm4j: thanks, ill try to fix it
 Zm4j: i solved it, thanks mate
 AlexZotz: i dont understand how to debug in this editor
 Counterbalance: All that's available there is printing to STDERR.. for real debugging you have to use an offline IDE
 AlexZotz: i mean the codinggame editor tells me to write a debug message in the console like this " // To debug: Console.Error.WriteLine("Debug messages...");"
 AlexZotz: but if i do exactly this: Console.Error.WriteLine($"Enemy HP is: {Enemy.HP}")
 AlexZotz: i get nothing
 Counterbalance: In the 'Console output' on the left-bottom of your screen, there's a pulldown
 Counterbalance: it says 'Game information, ..' or something. Make sure "Debug (errors stream)" is also enabled.
 AlexZotz: it works not in loops
 Scarfield: maybe you have a bug before the error print
 Counterbalance: try to put Console.Error.WriteLine("Hello!");right before you print the command for the turn - does that show up?
 AlexZotz: There is not error
 AlexZotz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3df0faaa-1b50-4761-a827-4888c356b353">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3df0faaa-1b50-4761-a827-4888c356b353</a>
 AlexZotz: just a simple foreach
 Hankdane: If you are running a puzzle or game with multiple turns, make sure to select the turn where you print the message.
 Counterbalance: you're doing Console.WriteLine("test") instead of Console.Error.WriteLine("test").The referee uses "test" as a command, which is probably wrong and terminates your program.
 Hankdane: C#? Console.WriteLine writes to stdout, not stderr.
 Hankdane: Ah, Counterbalance beat me to it.&#160;:)
 AlexZotz: its also dont work with Console.Error.WriteLine("test").
 AlexZotz: nvm i make a break here, i think this i not my art to learn programming
 AlexZotz: thx for your effort, have a ncie evening
 Counterbalance: It takes a while.. try again later after your break!
 Gorbit99: I fixed my freaking altgr problem with monaco vim

 Zm4j: ill look at it now
 Zm4j: try transforming every time into seconds, then find min value and then turn it back and print it into original form
 DarkLlama_cdac: Thank you!
 DaNinja: or just sort the strings
 zedd3v: yo
 zedd3v: why tf do i pass all the tests
 zedd3v: and then i submit my code and get 75%
 PatrickMcGinnisII: zedd3v your logic is flawed somehow, some condition isn't met
 PatrickMcGinnisII: DarkLlama_cdac so, tired of tiktok?
 zedd3v: i got that ostrich clash
 zedd3v: idk if you ever had it 
 zedd3v: but im sure my logic isnt flawed
 zedd3v: and i didnt hardcode anything
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ostrich weight?
 zedd3v: yea
 zedd3v: r=readlineg=r()print(g=="F"?~~(r()*1.2):g=="M"?r()/1.2:"UNKNOWN")
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did you truncate or round?
 zedd3v: yea
 zedd3v: and it passed all of the tests
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's probably in the trucation...hmm typecast to (int) prolly easiest
 zedd3v: idk 
 zedd3v: scuffed website
 PatrickMcGinnisII: (int)r*1.2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: test it  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/669cfb6b608d41b0607d16630b9423de355">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/669cfb6b608d41b0607d16630b9423de355</a>
 zedd3v: yea i had to round the second equation aswell
 zedd3v: but that test didnt show up 
 zedd3v: idk
 zedd3v: weird
 PatrickMcGinnisII: validators and test cases are different... sometimes designed to find common flaws
 PatrickMcGinnisII: some are evil, but not so much in clashes
 zedd3v: yea but dumb to approve solution lmfao
 zedd3v: and then give you 75% when you submit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: play SameGame, 45 lines of code and you can be in top 30

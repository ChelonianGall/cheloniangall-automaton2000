 MohamedZakaria: Hello
 MohamedZakaria: :eyes:
 Gorbit99: HEY
 Gorbit99: oops
 Gorbit99: caps
 Gorbit99: hey
 eulerscheZahl: moin
 MohamedZakaria: Guten morgen 
 Allis: Bon voyage.
 imgrbs: :joy:
 athensclub: do you know josho?
 athensclub: josho boiling
 SuthiwatPraesi: Im blind
 shinobi123: does anyone here code with python
 Gorbit99: if it's a question, it's usually better to ask it, instead of asking if you can ask it in the first place
 eulerscheZahl: i ignore this kind of question as i'm worried about the follow-up question that i feel obligated to answer
 AntiSquid: sinobi123 yes me and Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: no i just corrected myself
 AntiSquid: python was a mistake shinbi123
 AntiSquid: shinobi123
 MohamedZakaria: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Gorbit99: eulerscheZahl what could the follow up be that's so horrifying?
 jacek: ohai
 FinnWerner: whats up
 FinnWerner: girls
 eulerscheZahl: a question that needs a lot of text to answer or one that is plain boring
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to explain how the chuck norris puzzle works for the 10th time
 Allis: What is a chucknorris?
 Gorbit99: from experience, most questions like that can be answered in a few, usually language inspecific words
 Gorbit99: a unit of absolute measurement
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/chuck-norris">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/chuck-norris</a>

 AntiSquid: Allis <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bruce-lee">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bruce-lee</a> this one was better imo
 AntiSquid: ah nvm it's the other way around
 SydM107: Hello everyone
 Gorbit99: Hey there
 SydM107: I'm trying to figure out how to use a genetic algorithm for Code vs Zombies but I'm having trouble seeing how it could apply
 SydM107: there are so many factors and I can't see how to produce offspring
 Marchete: random angle + random dist?
 SydM107: hmm
 SydM107: but the number of moves would differ depending on all sorts of factors
 SPDene: genetic? or generic?
 Gorbit99: genetic probably
 SydM107: genetic
 Gorbit99: he's looking to outsource the work
 SydM107: haha no, 
 SPDene: that makes me think "if both daddy zombie and mummy zombie have blue eyes, baby zom,bie has blue eyes", sorry
 SydM107: I'm more of an ACO guy, I've never used genetic algorithms before
 Uljahn: SydM107: if you're ok with python i'd recommend this playground <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/334/genetic-algorithms/history">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/334/genetic-algorithms/history</a>
 SydM107: thanks
 SydM107: yeah python is fine
 MarianCejka: hi
 Maxlaxs: Hey
 Memo12334: anyone online?
 AlexisMolestos: me
 Memo12334: I get 75% on lumen and it's hard to find out why
 AlexisMolestos: I gonna try lumen now
 Memo12334: allright, like it passs all test cases but after there are more tests 2 of em fails there
 xlr4829: why why DZ
 Savorous_Sean: hi
 jacek: ohai
 Memo12334: AlexisMolestos how its goink 
 AlexisMolestos: it's not that easy :nerd:
 Memo12334: xD
 Memo12334: I can give tip if u want
 AlexisMolestos: yes please
 Memo12334: uhm u have to save the position the C's. And find distance between the X. I assume u converted the X and C to numbers tho
 jacek: hm?
 Memo12334: check Euclidean distance 
 Memo12334: jacek
 Memo12334: somehow my code only gets 75% for lumen :S
 Aldavon: yoyoy navid
 Aldavon: you outchea
 Aldavon: i mean nav
 Aldavon: sorry for the name drop
 AlexisMolestos: @Memo12334 thanks almost solved
 Memo12334: np
 Memo12334: if u get 100 tell me
 AlexisMolestos: 75 :joy:
 Memo12334: lmao
 Memo12334: gg
 AlexisMolestos: I think it's something with round
 Memo12334: yes
 Memo12334: there is also something called chebyshev distance
 eulerscheZahl: so you pass all visible testcases at lumen but fail on submit?
 Memo12334: yes
 AlexisMolestos: I read in forum many people have this problem
 eulerscheZahl: would you mind sharing the code? i'd like to have a look at it and maybe add an extra testcase
 Memo12334: sure
 Memo12334: here or?
 Memo12334: I will dm u
 eulerscheZahl: yes, paste it here
 Memo12334: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/edbeaeca-4bbd-4253-a025-7734625bf230">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/edbeaeca-4bbd-4253-a025-7734625bf230</a>
 eulerscheZahl: find_distance should do this:
 eulerscheZahl: return max(xd,yd);
 Memo12334: lol
 Memo12334: ok lemme see why it works now ;p
 SPDene: @eulerscheZahl if it helps, I had the same problem when I tried to use sum-of-squares to measure distance. it will pass all visible test cases then fail when submitted
 eulerscheZahl: yes, I just realized that too. I'll just swap a testcase and validator I guess. Or create a new (simple) testcase to make it clear
 SPDene: yeah - a visible test case which fails using ^^ that code would be good
 SydM107: Why do you calculate the absolute value in find_distance? it's completely unnecessary 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ef9a56c-f250-4986-aee0-4c8df56c071b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ef9a56c-f250-4986-aee0-4c8df56c071b</a>
 eulerscheZahl: expected: 9your code gets 10
 Memo12334: mine?
 Memo12334: I got 100/100
 eulerscheZahl: the 75% code I mean
 Memo12334: oh 
 eulerscheZahl: so that will be the new testcase
 Memo12334: ye the max worked, I see why now
 eulerscheZahl: easy enough to go through by hand
 Memo12334: SydM107 look again, it is necessary
 SydM107: how so? if xd  is negative xd*xd is positive, same goes for yd
 eulerscheZahl: updated. I took the opportunity to clean up the default code as well (reading each cell, not the whole line)
 eulerscheZahl: the pythagorean distance defines a circle @SydM107the solution expects a square around the lights
 Memo12334: oh sydm u meant that way , ye not needed indeed
 SydM107: that's a euclidean distance
 Memo12334: btw chebyshev is what is the best for this
 eulerscheZahl: right, Euclidean.by bad
 eulerscheZahl: my*
 AlexisMolestos: so you solved?
 eulerscheZahl: Yes.On Feb 23rd 2019
 AlexisMolestos: I googled for solution... Will I get banned?
 MSmits: no
 SPDene: if you're in a "fixing puzzles" mood, eulerscheZahl&#160;: in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/high-rise-buildings">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/high-rise-buildings</a> I believe the example given in the Goal (not the "Example" after the constraints) has no valid solution
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bf0b486f-d4d1-4a8b-8a3a-674e34f004f2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bf0b486f-d4d1-4a8b-8a3a-674e34f004f2</a>
 SPDene: yes that one
 JBM: dwarfie is active enough, you can tell him about it
 SPDene: ok
 eulerscheZahl: agreed, drawfie's jobmy program finds no solution assuming I correctly converted the input
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8de78975-d7c2-434e-98fe-77a6f45531fe">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8de78975-d7c2-434e-98fe-77a6f45531fe</a>

 eulerscheZahl: that 2 should be a 3
 SPDene: yep - it has to be symmetrical about a \ line
 dwarfie: yes euler , you approved it :D
 SPDene: LOL
 eulerscheZahl: so, will you edit it? :D
 dwarfie: of course ... i trust you when you tell that it should be 2 and not 3&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: I can't be help accountable for what I approved 2 years ago
 SPDene: ty
 SPDene: it delayed me a bit when solving it - i couldn't manually work out the answer!
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for reporting
 dwarfie: but ... if it is 2 , horizontally , it can be 2 and 2 ...?
 dwarfie: nor 3 vertically ...
 dwarfie: ok ... i found the real problem .... (just read all the discussion :D)
 eulerscheZahl: the real problem?Lumen having insufficient testcases?
 dwarfie: do old that it did not have difficulty set ... :D
 dwarfie: so old ... 
 dwarfie: no euler ... i was talking about mine ...
 SPDene: I didn't see a discussion link on that one - do you need to be a certain level to see it for v hard difficulty?
 Illedan: Discussion link? You talk about the forum link?
 SPDene: nope, once you've solved the, some puzzles have details/solutions/discussion tabs; others don't have the discussion
 SPDene: unless that's a link to forum post (if it exists)?
 eulerscheZahl: the discussion is an embedded forum
 eulerscheZahl: these thread get created automatically on approval. but for a while the forum bot creating those was inactive
 eulerscheZahl: or didn't exist for older contributions
 SPDene: ahh
 Memo12334: embedded systems?
 eulerscheZahl: forum embedded as an iframe<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/cXQOOgx">https://imgur.com/a/cXQOOgx</a>
 MunyoudoumPav: why is mu clash of code score reduced
 MunyoudoumPav: i got all test cases correct
 eulerscheZahl: the replay viewer has an iframe toofor sandboxing purposes I think
 SPDene: MunyoudoumPav was it fastest or shortest?
 MunyoudoumPav: fastest
 SPDene: and you finished first?
 MunyoudoumPav: yes
 JBM: validation cases too different from test cases?
 SPDene: maybe because you were against really low-score opponents? idk how the scoring works
 MunyoudoumPav: happened to me a few times already
 MunyoudoumPav: that's annoying

 LIONSxLEADER: Thoughts On ANEO?
 LIONSxLEADER: Seems pointless to apply from USA and their reviews are terrible. 
 Hjax: most people who apologize for their english have such flawless english i wouldn't have known otherwise 
 eulerscheZahl: I'm writing a refereeSorry in advance for my poor Java
 jacek: its like people who have clean room say 'sorry for the mess'
 tutubalin: sorry for my pure Java
 eulerscheZahl: not so pure, I mixed it with some JS
 lionrocker221: sorry for my profound mistakes within the english i am speaking
 eulerscheZahl: you are a native speaker, that doesn't count
 lionrocker221: lmfap

 lionrocker221: yes
 lionrocker221: it does
 Gorbit99: shortest mode is the best
 Gorbit99: no arguments
 lionrocker221: reverse mode is the best
 lionrocker221: no arguments
 Astrobytes: Not clashing is the best.Let the arguments commence.
 Illedan: :P 
 Illedan: :hammer:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 inoryy: idling in chat is the best
 Hjax: ^
 Hjax: sometimes i think it would be better if there was a separate chat for clashers 
 Hjax: because normally they show up in World and get shoo'd away by the chorus of "boooooo clash"
 Astrobytes: #clash
 Astrobytes: (it's real)
 Laminator: bicklil how did you solve that reverse?
 Astrobytes: Just not enough peeps know about it
 Laminator: actually, does anyone know how to solve the reverse, it had A beef = 64
 Laminator: bad face = 85
 Astrobytes: Also I'm going easy on the clashers in general atm cause the clash-specific chats aren't working
 bicklil: i just thinking of hexa value
 Astrobytes: *world not general
 bicklil: and I try to sum up the value in hexa and it was ok
 eulerscheZahl: I miss #general&#160;:(
 Memo12334: same
 jacek: #colonel
 eulerscheZahl: on a coder's website we spell it #kernel
 Memo12334: there is really easy challenge and I can't even solve it :S 
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Memo12334: coded it tho lmao
 Astrobytes: kernel, awesome
 Memo12334: detective pikaptcha ep1

 Memo12334: I had a question
 Memo12334: I get no exp anymore after solvign easy problems? 
 eulerscheZahl: you should get XP
 eulerscheZahl: i'll solve an easy one to see what happens
 eulerscheZahl: boring sudoku validator, i choose you
 Memo12334: ok maybe it was rlly low and I didn't realize
 Memo12334: oh sryI did get
 Memo12334: there is a tab where I can see em all
 Memo12334: sry sry
 eulerscheZahl: now i've already coded the input parsing&#160;:/
 Memo12334: sudoku validator is rlly hard challenge , quit now or spend a lot of hours
 Memo12334: its all about dem loops
 eulerscheZahl: solved it

 Memo12334: ah C# , the most popular language in the world
 Astrobytes: Gotta see sharp to C#
 Hjax: easy puzzles only take a couple minutes if you know what you are doing and are comfortable with the language youre writing 
 Hjax: thats why they are called easy puzzles :P 
 Memo12334: 2 easy puzzles per 10 hour for me
 Hjax: youll get better as you get more practice 
 Hjax: euler is the #1 ranked person on this site 
 Memo12334: I want to write bots like u guys and participate in AI darpa challenges
 Memo12334: when I grow up
 Hjax: then go find a multi that looks fun and get cracking 
 Hjax: no need to do puzzles first
 Memo12334: gotta first do some medium and hards
 eulerscheZahl: you are free to have a look at the games now. whatever motivates you
 Memo12334: one should be able to do some hard and medium challenges first
 Gorbit99: i haven't done hards before competitons
 Gorbit99: most people don't find the puzzles fun
 Memo12334: wait
 Memo12334: are they rlly different??
 Memo12334: I mean I thought it would be similiar stuff lol
 Gorbit99: nah, hard puzzles are harder than first few leagues in multis
 Gorbit99: they are very different
 Hjax: imo contests are by far the most fun 
 Memo12334: contests is vs another people right?
 Memo12334: solving as fast as possible
 eulerscheZahl: there is no real "solution"
 Hjax: not solving as fast as possible 
 Hjax: you write a program that plays a game against other peoples programs 
 Astrobytes: that would be clashes
 Hjax: if you win, you gain points
 Gorbit99: fast as possible is coc usually
 Hjax: whoever writes the best program at the game wins the contest 
 Gorbit99: in competitions it's basically like a tourney
 Memo12334: of contest is for proficient people I assume
 Gorbit99: no
 Hjax: contests are for everyone!
 Astrobytes: For everyone, it's all about the fun
 Memo12334: writing a program that plays a game?
 eulerscheZahl: there were almost 5k participants in the last contest
 Memo12334: seems advanced ;p
 Gorbit99: contests are the easiest thing to start on this site basically
 Hjax: you can usually write a simple program that plays the game 
 eulerscheZahl: only about 100 reached the highest league. didn't stop the others from trying
 Hjax: it doesnt have to be anything complex 
 Gorbit99: it can start with two if statements
 Memo12334: how can I train for that
 Gorbit99: practice
 Hjax: multis are old contests that anyone can play 
 Astrobytes: Get stuck in tbh
 Memo12334: ok I will do the bots thing after I am done with my current easy puzzle
 Hjax: i want another unofficial contest, the last one was fun 
 eulerscheZahl: i want a real contest
 Hjax: that too
 Hjax: i just hope the next contest is less annoying than pacman 
 Hjax: i really did not like pacman 
 eulerscheZahl: what was your problem with it?fog of war? rock paper scissors?
 Hjax: the way corners were blind 
 Hjax: you could get unlucky and just lose 
 Memo12334: hjax u write sc bots?
 Hjax: i do!
 Memo12334: cool
 Hjax: last contest my rank varied wildly even with the same submit, because of how heavy the luck factor was 
 Hjax: was pretty discouraging 
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen randomness in other contests before
 eulerscheZahl: at the top it's usually quite consistent. but below there's a lot of variance
 Hjax: randomness is fine if one bad random outcome doesnt mean instantly losing the game 
 eulerscheZahl: good point. there's no comeback in pacman
 Hjax: like the randomness with ore deposits in UTG was fine 
 Hjax: could you get really unlucky and lose? sure, but it didnt happen very often 
 Hjax: the better bot almost always won 
 JBM: didn't the bots start in the same position in utg?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 JBM: yeah, so no unlucky draw there
 Hjax: and the only other random thing was digging up your opponents mines, because you couldnt see them 
 Hjax: but that was more risk taking than losing to randomness 
 eulerscheZahl: the starting position wasn't that relevant anyways. 5 robots and 6 possible lines to start at
 Gorbit99: MadKnight dropped into my dms with "hey, do you need help with multis"
 AlexisMolestos: May I know if I need to lear vuejs framework what would you recommend? 
 Astrobytes: MadKnight has returned?!
 Gorbit99: only in my dms
 Astrobytes: And it was *the* MadKnight and not an impostor right?
 Gorbit99: I assume so
 JBM: sounded like him anyway
 Gorbit99: this "hey, want some help in multi" is a madknight thing
 Astrobytes: That is true.
 Gorbit99: his discord is TheVillainAgain
 JBM: which doesn't mean a thing as it's the first thing any impostor would do
 Gorbit99: I assume he's madknight
 inoryy: that does look like his username
 Hjax: maybe hes a ghost 
 Hjax: ooooh spooky 
 Hjax: :P
 Astrobytes: MadFright
 Astrobytes: Donno why he doesn't come back in chat tbh
 Gorbit99: I can ask if you want
 Astrobytes: Go for it. We saw the chat where he said he quit, but... not like MadKnight to actually quit
 Gorbit99: he's talking about some weird russian movei
 Hjax: well, he is russian 
 Astrobytes: The basketball one?
 Gorbit99: no, this one is an alien one
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Hjax: ive been looking into the stockfish nnue stuff, pretty mindblowing 
 Hjax: +100 elo in like, a week 
 Astrobytes: It's insanely strong huh

 Hjax: thats like a year of progress, all at once 
 Astrobytes: wow, ain't it just!
 Hjax: and the idea is still so young, im sure theres a lot of room to improve still 
 Hjax: make better nets, use it in different ways, etc
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: it's a game changer for sure
 jacek: surprisingly this is similar to what im doing several past weeks
 Hjax: what are you working on?
 jacek: using NN for eval, training in supervised/unsupervised mix
 Hjax: what game i mean?
 Astrobytes: Several&#160;;)
 jacek: right now breakthrough
 inoryy: nice, jacek
 Astrobytes: Been impressive so far, how is Breakthrough coming along?
 jacek: im still testing different net archtecture and learning ways
 jacek: and i think i found a bug in some of my endings
 Hjax: writing my own nns is still quite a bit over my head
 Hjax: so many people doing fancy stuff on this site :P 
 Hjax: ive considered trying to go back to school and getting a masters in machine learning 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's cool to see people pushing the boundaries
 Astrobytes: ask inoryy for advice
 jacek: i would be bored in machine learning lessons
 jacek: too much theory
 jacek: i just want to code stuff and see results
 jacek: thats why i like machine learning. it works and i dont care why
 Hjax: lol
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 inoryy: reminds me of this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.iwastesomuchtime.com/7102012232216iwsmt.jpeg">https://cdn.iwastesomuchtime.com/7102012232216iwsmt.jpeg</a>
 Hjax: i did take linear algebra and an intro to ml class in college 
 Hjax: so i know the basics 
 Astrobytes: lol inoryy
 jacek: though i liked turing machines
 jacek: but then again there were many weird symbols
 Astrobytes: I really should refresh my maths a bit, very rusty tbh. All this pharmaceutical stuff doesn't really  work the maths muscles 
 jacek: rusty :F
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: i tried to figure out how leela works at some point 
 Hjax: i understand the concept, but the technical details are beyond me 
 jacek: its always the technical details
 Gorbit99: Astrobytes Madknight said he's working on other things
 jacek: at first i made xor example in python, then without library, then without numpy, just for loops and multiplication. then i rewritten it to C++
 jacek: and it started and I dont see the end of it
 Astrobytes: Gorbit99 tell him I said (we all said) hello and come back once in a while if he has time 
 jacek: mk? that troll?
 Gorbit99: already put down the call
 Astrobytes: ah
 Gorbit99: I basically listened to him trying to explain the entire plot of the movie
 Astrobytes: definitely MadKnight
 Gorbit99: seems like he's happy to talk to people if you want
 Astrobytes: He was never unwelcome
 Astrobytes: He just left one day
 Uljahn: i guess we (non-natives) have to use every chance to practice english or it becomes rusty in no time

 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's just weird :P

 SPDene: hjax you should try welsh - our equivalent of DMV website: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency.cy">https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency.cy</a> (scroll down)
 Hjax: that looks like its been through a blender 
 Hjax: "trwyddedau" 
 SPDene: that's "licenses"
 Hjax: i wouldnt have guessed that :D 
 Hjax: the UK is a fascinating place, i hope to visit some day 
 Astrobytes: Hehe, Welsh is related with Cornish and Breton languages, shares little with Scots Gaelic. Great that Wales embraces the language more than we do 
 Astrobytes: We're 'working on it' apparently
 Hjax: do brits think that americans have cool accents? or is that a one way affair? 
 AntiSquid: fascinating in what way?
 Hjax: theres a lot of history and different cultures crammed together in a small space 
 SPDene: you have accents? all americans sound the same. we have a different accent if you go down the road 10 miles :P
 Astrobytes: Is it still being pushed SPDene? Learning Welsh that is
 Astrobytes: I hope so
 SPDene: I'm not welsh&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Oh I thought you were given the link
 SPDene: I just find it fascinating that all UK government websites are translated into welsh
 Hjax: americans have accents, people from the south sound much different from the north 
 JBM: weren't they written in welsh, then translated to english?
 Astrobytes: Because it's their language
 Hjax: new york and boston areas have strongish accents too 
 Astrobytes: US accents vary wildly
 Astrobytes: But I guess they can be subtle at times
 SPDene: yeah - I'm oversimplifying... but I could identify maybe 5 US accents... and 200 UK accents
 Hjax: i think my accent is mostly what would be considered "general american" which is probably quite boring 
 Hjax: everyone in the US thinks british accents are cool 
 Astrobytes: People over here get certain New England accents confused with New York accents for instance
 JBM: wait until they realize most of them are muggles
 AntiSquid: even the strong accents? :D
 Hjax: people from boston are incapable of pronouncing the letter r 
 Hjax: pahk the cah
 JBM: that's most of uk too isn't it?
 Astrobytes: lol I was gonna say cahpahk
 Astrobytes: I have relatives over that way
 Hjax: im just far enough from NYC and Boston that i dont have either accent 
 jacek: why theres r in colonel
 SPDene: most of the sowthwest UK use a rhotic R... the rest of the country not so much
 JBM: perfect opposite of the US
 AntiSquid: sometimes it's hard to tell whether someone is speaking a different language or is just pronouncing words weirdly:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/ySyBMTo-1sc?t=15">https://youtu.be/ySyBMTo-1sc?t=15</a>
 AntiSquid: (good movie btw)
 Hjax: ive known a few people from england who had the most amazing accents 
 Astrobytes: That's supposed to be 'pikey' Irish 
 Astrobytes: (travellers)
 AntiSquid: giving one example there
 SPDene: try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk-_XlU5s6A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk-_XlU5s6A</a> (orkney)
 AntiSquid: not everyone understands strong scottish accent either btw, i didn't have that much difficulty so far, but there are native brits who have problems understanding
 AntiSquid: i understand that SPDene&#160;! :o
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if you can understand Irish or Welsh people you can understand Scots islanders (most of the time)
 AntiSquid: Hjax i call that posh snob accent (no offense intended though) :p
 Astrobytes: Not if they're fu' though
 Hjax: it sounds incredible though 
 Hjax: the people with really smooth accents 
 Astrobytes: The American 'favourite' English accents usually indicate people who are of the upper class
 Astrobytes: i.e. the ruling class
 Astrobytes: Many in the UK don't take kindly to those accents
 Hjax: interesting 
 SPDene: Astrobytes you mean people who pronounce house "hice"?
 Astrobytes: Oh if they could have some kind of return to feudalism here they'd go for it.
 Astrobytes: Depending how you say that SPDene it could also be a Norn Irn accent :P
 SPDene: true - but i mean the homecounties ones
 BASWESD: Im looking for a frontend job in Ca bay area
 AntiSquid: they seem very common in ox, even among the "normal" people though so don't see the problem
 AntiSquid: i am more worried about chavs and the "got a li' may'&#160;? "
 Astrobytes: You're spoiled in that Oxon you are
 AntiSquid: (translation: got a light mate)
 Astrobytes: No shit. Try living in Peckham
 AntiSquid: well when i first heard that kind pronunciation i just stared and the guy said it exactly the same just louder getting angry, i was like "wtf?", walked away
 SPDene: your "li' may'" reminded me of Limmy - I imagine is accent's quite hard for some people to understand
 SPDene: his*
 Hjax: the brits have taken over the chat 
 SPDene: haha
 Astrobytes: Stay in Oxfordshire AntiSquid. Don't leave under any circumstances
 AntiSquid: lol why
 Astrobytes: Because of what you said. You'll be on the first train back within minutes :P
 Astrobytes: Well, you can try a few of the other Counties but don't venture into the city centre :P
 Hjax: i dont think theres any part of the US where i would have issues understanding their accent 
 SPDene: yeah - oxford's not my idea of "full of chavs" compared to other places
 Astrobytes: Quite
 AntiSquid: hah, doubt it met people from other cities too and bringing things like these up with others doesn't seem to bother most
 AntiSquid: even the people from the capital of joy riding can have a normal conversation some times
 SPDene: for anyone who doesn't understand "chav".. think "ned"... but that won't help you either&#160;:)&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: suburbian culture
 Hjax: when i hear chav i think of eggsy from kingsman
 Hjax: is that good enough
 Astrobytes: I went to Witney once, when I visited the Wychwood brewery. The pub was interesting
 Astrobytes: lol, ned
 AntiSquid: witney seems very quite
 AntiSquid: quiet
 Astrobytes: It is
 AntiSquid: relaxed town
 Astrobytes: a bit... too quiet
 Astrobytes: lol, was just typical small-place vibes. Was alright
 AntiSquid: Hjax imagine skinny dehydrated extremely casually clothed individual telling you how cool it is to get high and inviting you to a joint with them

 Natorade: how do I output an error message in c++?
 Astrobytes: cerr &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; endl;
 Hjax: you could have been describing me until the last bit 
 AntiSquid: cerr &lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; endl;///
 AntiSquid: ok ...
 Natorade: ty &lt;3
 Astrobytes: yw
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes is that a ned translator or what
 Astrobytes: Compilation of the "Interpreting for the neds" segments of Chewin' The Fat, a Scottish comedy from a while ago
 Astrobytes: neds = non-educated delinquents = chavs
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9BqmJrrW0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE9BqmJrrW0</a> sorry for offtopic, but new video&#160;!! always fun channel

 blakestone: Hello, is there a way to print/debug something without it registering as an output in the IDE? When I try to do this it's treating it as an output and failing to progress etc. Thanks.
 blakestone: for Javascript
 DaNinja: console.error("test')
 blakestone: worked - thank you&#160;:)
 xxd: getting closer and closer to getting this GA to work...
 ProCoder03: how to floodfill @xxd&#160;??
 xxd: OH MY GOD
 xxd: IM SO CLOSE TO GETTING IT WORKING I THINK
 xxd: LOOK AT THIS SCREENSHOT
 ProCoder03: dude is it Mars Lander 2&#160;??
 xxd: wait let me try it on a harder one
 xxd: yeah im doing mars lander
 ProCoder03: wontonimo did it in just 19 lines&#160;!!!
 ProCoder03: PIDs
 xxd: yeah
 xxd: but hopefully my method generalizes to all the Mars landers problems&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: superb&#160;!!!
 xxd: okay im doing a trick where i only check collisions every 12 moves and its biting me
 xxd: xD
 ProCoder03: Btw where did you learn GA&#160;???
 xxd: I learnt a lot of it from Di_masta's Mars landers post mortem
 xxd: :pray:
 xxd: its really good cuz he tells u exactly what he was thinking at each step. i stil had a bunch of questions tho which havent been answered yet
 ProCoder03: welll, i read that my mind literally died&#160;!!
 ProCoder03: GA is confusing:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 xxd: my code doesnt even deserve to work right now though... my fitness function is literally so bad
 RightHandElf: use a genetic algorithm to make a better fitness function
 ProCoder03: are there any pre requisite for GA&#160;??
 ProCoder03: I am just 15 and finding GA terrible hard&#160;??
 xxd: frik
 ProCoder03: what's frik&#160;??
 xxd: cuss word
 xxd: im gonna ask wonton if he ran two floodfills
 HMS_123: hi
 ProCoder03: hi 
 HMS_123: hey y'all did the 'Coders Strike Back'?Can u tell me the answer for the code?
 HMS_123: I can't find it lol
 ProCoder03: you can't find it&#160;!!!
 HMS_123: Yea
 ProCoder03: you need to code it yourself
 ProCoder03: hint: see the last line of the code&#160;!!
 xxd: there's no answer
 xxd: quite literally
 ProCoder03: is there any string Contains method in C++
 ProCoder03:&#160;??
 M1nerman: well, no, but you can work out whether a substring exists with the find() method
 ProCoder03: Thanks , that's exactly what I want&#160;!!!

 xxd: A:OIFJ:WOIEJF:WOIEJF:OIWHE:IOFJWE:OIFJ
 xxd: alright
 xxd: im making steady progress
 xxd: look at that floodfilled beauty
 xxd: i think wontonimo will be proud of me
 ProCoder03: wow!!!
 ProCoder03: really nice&#160;!!
 ProCoder03: Mars Lander 3, right&#160;???
 xxd: yeah 
 xxd: i am like
 xxd: pretty close i think
 shashj: Hello everyone!
 shashj: How is the lockdown treating you all??
 xxd: badly
 xxd: eh
 xxd: my school year is starting in &lt;36 hours
 Westicles: lockdown? lol that was last year
 shashj: LOL Its now for us
 xxd: so close yet so far 
 xxd: i need to mess with like 200000000 hyperparameters
 xxd: wait. i completely forgot that each pair of parents makes TWO children
 xxd: that is so not similar to real life
 Westicles: Such a shame, Australia used to be such tough guys.  
 martinpapa69: they even won the great emo war
 martinpapa69: emu*
 RightHandElf: they very specifically did not win the great emu war
 martinpapa69: ye, i just checked on wiki :D
 martinpapa69: I thought it was only a meme
 xxd: my GA was like sorta working, then i fixed some bugs and now its broken
 RightHandElf: lmao
 xxd: I feel like GA where genes are delta_angle and delta_thrust is just... odd
 martinpapa69: GA too is just a meme algo
 xxd: im starting to believe that
 martinpapa69: there are better algos out there
 Westicles: I feel like someone should tell him most ML2 solutions are 3-4 if statements
 xxd: brb gonna write a GA to try all combinations of 3-4 if statements
 ProCoder03: @xxd <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZE86BPDqCI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZE86BPDqCI</a>
 ProCoder03: this one is abt using PID controllers with GA&#160;!!
 ProCoder03: *tuning a PID
 xxd: thanks, will watch

 EthanLu34: curry=STEPH=GOATüêê
 grindy: curry, haha
 Broski_974: curry &lt;3
 grindy: hi
 grindy: i am back:)
 grindy: me back
 grindy: food?
 grindy:&#160;?
 Uljahn: next time is ban
 grindy: sorry i will stop
 peppers: lol
 peppers: how can i see others code?
 Uljahn: in clashes or puzzles?
 peppers: puzzles
 peppers: new here.
 Uljahn: solve it at 100% first
 peppers: emm.
 EthanLu34: hi
 EthanLu34: clashes
 peppers: u mean all problem???
 EthanLu34: idk
 Uljahn: no, solve the puzzle to see other's solutions
 EthanLu34: how u kick people?"
 Uljahn: with mod powers
 EthanLu34:&#160;???
 EthanLu34: so u famous?
 EthanLu34: also i followed u
 EthanLu34: :happy:
 EthanLu34: :grinning:
 peppers: i just solve a problem but in the  share web,  everyone has a locked icon.. :joy:
 Uljahn: is your result 100%?
 peppers: yep    successfully submited
 grindy: i finish one&#160;:)
 EthanLu34: gimme code
 Uljahn: peppers: while being in the puzzle click results on the left, then click "Learn from the best coders"
 peppers: let me see
 EthanLu34: ...
 Uljahn: giving a code is not encouraged here
 grindy: me gots 100%
 Westicles: I think it is... there is XP incentive to publish
 peppers: @Uljahn  see it, thanks.
 Westicles: oh you mean on chat... sorry, I agree
 peppers: aha  if i submit with python . i cant see other language solution right? 
 Uljahn: ye
 peppers: ye, thanks for guide
 grindy: bye bye bye bye i am leaveing
 Almin5k: Goodbye Grindy, if you‚Äôre brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new hello.
 dotori: :grinning:
 Panavia_tornado: anyone used bezier curves in coders strike back?
 Uljahn: not reasonable
 Uljahn: any collision will push you out of an optimal path
 Panavia_tornado: i play at wooden league, no collision
 Uljahn: seems like overengineering for a wood league
 Panavia_tornado: I suspect here the main difficulty in the beginning is that I cannot instantly turn the car in the right direction
 Uljahn: yes, there is a limit of 18 degrees per turn max
 DJUndyingKnight_b8a9: any further hints for the ASCII art excercise? i don't understand how to transform a text input like 'E' to my program knowing its shape without hardcoding anything&#160;:&lt;
 Westicles: did you look at the hints?
 DJUndyingKnight_b8a9: yea i saw that the shapes are given in input, my question was badly phrased. i guess what i don't understand is, how to use that input properly
 Armin_programmer2010: hello every body
 DJUndyingKnight_b8a9: like how to compare the asked letter "e" with the shapes given
 KiwiTae: they give you the ascii version of the alphabet 
 Merfi: is there anyone else who has some difficulty with the weekly puzzle? becaus i have
 Armin_programmer2010: me too
 Armin_programmer2010: hey guys
 Westicles: which one is it?
 Armin_programmer2010: how can i get the 100% of score in clash?
 Merfi: it is called PROPOSITIONS IN FREGE‚ÄôS IDEOGRAPHY, do you maybe have any tips/hints on how to do it?
 Westicles: Not a very popular puzzle... I would ask on the forum
 RightHandElf: I did it with recursion and python's eval function
 RightHandElf: and then iterating over every possible combination of trues and falses for every token
 Merfi: ok thanks very much, i will try to do that
 Armin_programmer2010: hello
 LTims080913: I can't click on results to see solutions
 LTims080913: I'm doing "temperatures"
 Uljahn: you can see solutions until you 100% solve it
 Uljahn: *can't
 LTims080913: then how do I LEARN??? I want to be able to solve algorithms but can't seem to think correctly
 Akshei: You try as long, to do it correctly, one way or another, or you can ask us for hints
 Akshei: Getting solutions is not learning
 LTims080913: Have you finished "temperatures"?
 Akshei: Yup, they are pretty easy
 Akshei: What inputs do you get in this exercise?
 LTims080913: the number of temperatures to analyze (n) 
 LTims080913: and a string  with the temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526
 Akshei: And what output do you need to write? 
 LTims080913: I need to display 0 if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise display the temperature closest to 0
 KiwiTae: if n = 0 return 0?
 Akshei: And how can you check, what temperature from input is closest to 0?
 LTims080913: idk
 KiwiTae: is 199999 or 1 closest to 0?
 Armin_programmer2010: how can i solve all of the clash of code reverse mode
 Armin_programmer2010:&#160;??
 RightHandElf: for CoC, you've just gotta be able to recognize the pattern
 Armin_programmer2010: i know
 Armin_programmer2010: i mean how to enter the answers
 TobiasA: or use openAI codex
 LTims080913: 1
 Westicles: You know guys, Forrest Gump got through his whole life without doing any programming, and he was happy.  Just something to think about
 RightHandElf: mama always said programming was like a box of chocolates
 RightHandElf: [punchline]
 LTims080913: lol
 Armin_programmer2010: lol
 Akshei: How do you know that 1 is closest to 0? 
 Akshei: And what is closest to 0, 2337 or -1995? 
 Westicles: Akshei, have you ever played ping pong?
 TobiasA: min(abs(2337), abs(-1995))
 LTims080913: because it is smaller
 LTims080913: and -1995
 TobiasA: pong ping
 peppers: who like pingpong?
 peppers: :raised_hands:
 TobiasA: me
 Armin_programmer2010: me
 Armin_programmer2010: me
 TobiasA: want to play?
 TobiasA: :ping_pong:
 Uljahn: guys, join #pingpong gang, don't spam here
 TobiasA: pingpong looks dead
 TobiasA: i'll pass
 Westicles: We were trying to gently suggest there are minimal mental requirements needed to program.  Maybe something should be added to the FAQ?
 Armin_programmer2010: hey how can i create a group in here?
 TobiasA: there was a time i mistakenly pronounced FAQ as fack-que
 RightHandElf: well fack que too, pal
 TobiasA: brruh
 TobiasA: frequently asked questions too you too
 TobiasA: to*
 Merfi: does anyone have tips for the spring challenge 2021? im stuck
 derjack: use fertilizers

 Coder_noob001: any tips for increasing the difficulty level in private clash
 derjack: make shortest mode in java only
 Seahorse06: :D
 UltraDarkCoder: how to increase thrust in coders strikes back&#160;; help me please
 TobiasA: step 1: increase thrust
 TobiasA: literally
 Uljahn: step 2: promote to higher leagues and use boost
 Uljahn: UltraDarkCoder: how does your output look like?
 Uljahn: should be 3 space separated numbers, third one is thrust, max thrust is 100 till legend
 UltraDarkCoder: I done it
 UltraDarkCoder: thank you
 UltraDarkCoder: sorry about my grammer
 Uljahn: no problem
 KNTK: Is it okay to copy and paste code in CoC, such as predefined functions and data structures? I assume yes, just want to hear confirmation. 
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 KNTK: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: paste all of your templates. especially for shortest mode
 eulerscheZahl: did anyone solve a puzzle recently while having the auto-publish feature enabled in the profile settings?to me it looks like my published solution remains private
 Westicles: which puzzle?  I can check if I can see it
 eulerscheZahl: i checked in incognito mode. but sure. this one for instance<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/adversarial-mate-with-rook">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/adversarial-mate-with-rook</a>
 Westicles: nope, not there
 Westicles: I know zeno was having problems with solutions auto publishing when he didn't want them to...
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/adversarial-mate-with-rook">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/adversarial-mate-with-rook</a>it says published. i guess i'll report it on discord
 Wontonimo: i think anyone with an IQ above 80 can do some programming if they are patient and interested and we are liberal with the term "programmer" to include excel formulas and scratch.mit.edu
 Wontonimo: oh, geez, sorry
 Wontonimo: i guess my scroll didn't update.  i was obviously looking at an old post by Westicles
 Westicles: heh heh
 eulerscheZahl: so this was not your reaction to me soling the adversarial mate?
 Wontonimo: no no&#160;!
 Wontonimo: West posted something around 5 hours ago, now that i look at the time stamp
 MSmits: I don't think using excel is easier than some programming languages
 MSmits: it's mighty unintuitive
 MSmits: maybe this is because of coming from math/physics
 MSmits: not sure
 Westicles: the Bell Curve guy wrote you need 120 minimum to be a competitive programmer, but of course everyone thinks he is evil or whatever
 MSmits: competitive is the operative word there
 MSmits: you don't actually need to be competitive imho
 eulerscheZahl: i facepalm every time a colleague wants to use excel for data entry and expects my program to extract the inputs and generate another excel from it
 Wontonimo: it's the "new" normal average IQ 110 or 120 anyway.
 eulerscheZahl: much less effective now that I work from home (and without a webcam)
 eulerscheZahl: average IQ is 100 by definition
 Wontonimo: if we are talking about IQ measuring abstract thinking
 Wontonimo: average IQ *was* 100 at the time it was created
 eulerscheZahl: so if you have an IQ of 100 today and later generations get smarter, your IQ will actually decrease without you doing anything
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect</a>
 Wontonimo: that's not how they do it in America iirc
 MSmits: nah, they educate their kids worse with every new generation, just to make their IQ go up :P
 martinpapa69: pretty smart of them
 eulerscheZahl: and you are part of that system of bad education
 Westicles: they play around with the standard deviation sometimes, it isn't standardized
 MSmits: I am not American :P
 MSmits: we have our own education problems 
 eulerscheZahl: we too. whenever a new Pisa study comes out *insert this-is-fine meme*
 Wontonimo: I REALLY liked this ted talk (before ted talks became just product advertisements) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_higher_than_our_grandparents?language=en">https://www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_higher_than_our_grandparents?language=en</a>
 MSmits: in my country it's mostly a matter of investment and making the job as a teacher more attractive
 MSmits: it used to be a high status job, but not it's almost looked down upon in some circles
 MSmits: that's not good for quality
 Wontonimo: a great reminder that the last 100 years has been substantially different than the previous 100,000 
 eulerscheZahl: but not = now?
 MSmits: but now yes
 MSmits: The question that's sometimes asked:
 eulerscheZahl: some people just see that teachers got lots of holidays
 MSmits: Hey you got a university degree, why go into teaching?
 eulerscheZahl: and don't see that you have to invest time outside of class
 MSmits: they forget you actually *need* this degree to even teach the ages/levels i teach
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl that too
 Wontonimo: in North America, there used to be a saying "They who can do, those who can't teach", so yeah, there is certainly a lack of respect for teachers here
 MSmits: if you go back 50 yrs or so, doctors, teachers and lawyers would have about the same status
 Wontonimo: I love teaching, but my dad repeating that phrase when I was young really got me out of considering it
 MSmits: yeah it's bad
 MSmits: teaching requires actual talent beyond the subject you're teaching
 Westicles: Yep.  A=business owner, B=employee, C=teacher, D=government
 eulerscheZahl: former chancellor Schr√∂der called teachers "faule S√§cke" (lazy *scumbags? - not sure how to translate best*)
 MSmits: wow really
 Wontonimo: Teachers in Canada make great money, on par with other trained professionals, and better benefits
 MSmits: oh, we actually don't get paid that badly, most of us
 MSmits: the weird thing though, is that all teachers more or less get paid the same if they teach the same level of education, no matter the subject
 MSmits: so an English teacher gets the same as a CS teacher
 MSmits: which makes it *really* hard to find CS teachers
 eulerscheZahl: as industry pays much higher on that field
 MSmits: yeah, if you're at all competent at it, that is
 MSmits: so mostly what you see is the biology teacher doing CS on the side, because noone else is available
 eulerscheZahl: my CS education in the school wasn't much better
 Wontonimo: It's a fantastic career option in Canada.  The pay is related to the number of core subjects you can teach (not the number you actually teach), if you can teach in English and French, and how many age group related specializations you have (children, teens, adult), and special needs certifications.
 eulerscheZahl: but good enough to get my interested in that field at least
 EngineHeart: can I join clashes only in one languiage&#160;?
 EngineHeart: cause Java is longer and slower to code&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you can switch the language above the code editor
 EngineHeart: I can but I use Java only as primary language&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yeah, use python if you want to win clashes
 eulerscheZahl: for private clashes it's possible to disable language selection
 EngineHeart: my question is can I compete on speed only with Java
 EngineHeart: I see
 Wontonimo: yeah, that is true
 Wontonimo: hey EngineHeart, have you seen any of the puzzles&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 EngineHeart: so no way unless I find other Java dudes? that's kind-a weird
 Wontonimo: you can use java there.  There is no time limit
 EngineHeart: sure I'm doing these as well
 Wontonimo: and java does NOT put you at a disadvantage 
 EngineHeart: but wanted to getr chalaange on Clash (for fun)
 EngineHeart: and the best so far is 1sec less the pyton (I shoulnd test all but just the first TC)
 Wontonimo: well, if you are looking for fun, try out this bot battle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a>
 Wontonimo: where your code battles other peoples code
 MSmits: EngineHeart clash of code is to me, the least interesting thing on CG
 Wontonimo: there are lots of other bot battles too.
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 MSmits: or optimization arena's or practice puzzles
 EngineHeart: true - I just wanted to win&#160;:) this is the interesting part.... the rets is within the other tasks
 EngineHeart: I'm here cause of an interview where I times out
 EngineHeart: timed*
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: well
 EngineHeart:&#160;:)
 MSmits: i recommend just doing practice puzzles
 MSmits: you'll get faster without a time limit also
 Wontonimo: i second that recommendation
 MSmits: why stress yourself?
 EngineHeart: so no worries I just wanted to know if I can LOCK the lang to Java in the Clashes
 EngineHeart: if not I'm moving on
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: language remains a free choice
 sasani: Hi
 Wontonimo: EngineHeart , did they ask you to code in Java for the interview clash?
 Wontonimo: Ni sasani
 Wontonimo: *Hi
 sasani: My friends, I am a newcomer
 Wontonimo: I can tell :D
 Wontonimo: (lack of profile pic gives it away)
 sasani: Teach me someone who knows programming
 Wontonimo: try some of these puzzles sasani <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 sasani: Do you have WhatsApp to talk to?
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: i'm too old for that
 MSmits: for 2 yrs I thought whatsapp was an appstore
 sasani: I want you to help me with programming
 eulerscheZahl: we can. but not on whatsapp
 Wontonimo: what programming experience do you have and what programming language do you know?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm modern enough to have a discord account :muscle:
 MSmits: discord confuses me
 Wontonimo: lol
 MSmits: I like it, in principle
 eulerscheZahl: i muted most channels because there were always those unread notes
 MSmits: I just get lost
 sasani: I am a computer engineering student
 MSmits: oh right, that's probably my problem too euler
 Wontonimo: and what programming language do you have some experience in?
 MSmits:  when you have to go here to learn 
 MSmits: your professors might not be very good :P
 MSmits: ask for refund imho
 Wontonimo: no!  not at all.  You just may be keen
 Westicles: You guys are so nice.  I guess bringing up IQ and making comparisons to Forrest Gump is less friendly..
 sasani: JavaScript and C # are basic
 MSmits: python is like a box of chocolates
 MSmits: you never know what it's gonna do
 Wontonimo: sasani, you can select either Javascript or c# as the language you want to use in any of the programming challenges or multis here.
 Westicles: All but one...
 MSmits: C# is a great language to learn with
 Wontonimo: If you want to learn the basics, like "if" "while" "for" and "arrays", this is not the place sasani.  
 eulerscheZahl: just don't try Pascal
 MSmits: has a little bit of everything, yet easy to get into
 jacek: kids these days... back in my days we were using irc
 sasani: Well I do not know I do not want to help me if any programmer knows professionally
 eulerscheZahl: i still know my ICQ number
 Wontonimo: do you use it in your passwords?
 MSmits: I never did
 MSmits: I did use icq
 TobiasA: what is irc?
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: kids these days
 eulerscheZahl: chat protocol
 Wontonimo: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 TobiasA: irc is chat protocol?
 Westicles: iirc
 TobiasA: what is iirc?
 Wontonimo: and i bet they also never had to use a tap drive as their only storage device (no hard drive or disk)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat</a>and iirc = if i remember correctly
 sasani: Can anyone help you with your programming career?
 TobiasA: check youtube sasani
 AlirezaNum1: hi i need a friend who has started to learn programming recently(python)
 sasani: I also need someone to teach me Python
 TobiasA: what about one who didn't start recently?
 AlirezaNum1: im not in high level to teach 
 sasani: If you have WhatsApp, give us a number so we can group there
 TobiasA: so irc is just social media
 AlirezaNum1: +989331665090
 MSmits: irc is like discord
 MSmits: except more anonymous
 MSmits: I think
 sasani: Alireza is my name, Mohammad Reza
 TobiasA: oh got it

 TobiasA: what happened to whatsapp sasani
 eulerscheZahl: he's gone
 MSmits: it got taken over by facebook
 MSmits: which is why you should be terrified of using it
 MSmits: i can never get over the fact that they state in their terms of use that you have to be 16 or older (or is it 18?) and teachers let whole classes make whatsapp chat groups for 12 yr olds
 MSmits: very irresponsible
 JBM: yes but zoom=CCP
 jacek: you give idea for the kids to report the teachers
 MSmits: they dont want to
 MSmits: they all love their whatsapp
 Westicles: reddit=CCP as well
 jacek: like they 1-starred zoom/meet/etc so no lessons would be done
 MSmits: we dont use zoom at my school
 MSmits: MS teams + google
 Wontonimo: oh, there is an interesting marking on the right side of the chat, starting with MSmits saying "pretty sure those are ..."
 Westicles: that's was euler's contribution
 MSmits: yeah, sometimes the chat wants to emphasize the good points i make

 MSmits: oh noes
 MSmits: don't cross out
 MSmits: my wise words
 Scarfield: im emphasizing them :p
 MSmits: you're doin it wrong :P
 Wontonimo: no really, what is that from?  Is that a mod feature to emphasize or mark part of the conversation?
 Scarfield: weird unicode stuff, idk
 jacek: its emergence from automaons
 GroutchKeu: :o
 TobiasA: :O
 Wontonimo: I think it was right after "oh I have something to contribute too" eulerscheZahl
 Wontonimo: what did you paste right at the end of that sentence&#160;?
 TobiasA: now my name is obiasA
 Wontonimo: fun unicode stuff!
 Uljahn: guess it's a char from zalgo font
 TobiasA: probably the ending moves of msmits oware bot:joy:
 eulerscheZahl: actually that long vertical line was "invented" by AutomatonNN
 MSmits: it's emergent behavior
 Uljahn: doubt it
 eulerscheZahl: probably a bug
 eulerscheZahl: Agade said it should not print non-ASCII characters. yet it did

 T-riPheo: hi
 jacek: ohai
 xxJoxx: heyy
 michaellan: hi
 michaellan: good morning
 TobiasA: hi 
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 michaellan: when I compile with sanitizers I get an error but when I compile normally it runs without error
 michaellan: :rage:
 ProCoder03: probably, your code is refusing it because it's already immune to COVID 
 jacek: :drum:
 ProCoder03: @xxd are trying to compile natively on mac
 michaellan: its fine i fixed it
 michaellan: I just.. dont inherently get how a GA _would_ work for this problem
 KalamariKing: what problem?
 michaellan: Mars lander 2/3
 TobiasA:  you can do mars lander 2 the physics way
 KalamariKing: yeah wouldn'
 KalamariKing: t a traditional convolutional work beter
 michaellan: tf
 Scarfield: you make a "gene" out of the action choices you have (angle,thrust), a genome (a series of genes). Simulate how the pod would fly with the actions from a genome and evaluate. 
 Scarfield: have a population of many genomes, keep track of the best scoring ones, make crossovers and mutations, rince and repeat
 michaellan: Yeah but crossovers ...
 michaellan: like I'm at least doing d_angle and d_thrust, not angle and thrust
 michaellan: because that's what di_masta did
 michaellan: so at each point its [-15,15] and [-1,1]
 Scarfield: thats fine, depending on the way you do it, you need to make sure that the genomes still work within the game rules after crossover.
 Scarfield: iterate through them, if total angle or thrust is out of bounds, fix them
 Uljahn: welcome to a local optimum, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: tell him to play csb
 Scarfield: xD
 Wontonimo: no, i disagree Scarfield.  Don't fix the out of bounds.  That could be a possible mutation to fix them, but don't always
 Wontonimo: the bounds checking would be in the interpretation 
 xxd: I clamp them during simulation
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'd go with that
 xxd: my local testing looks really good but its not translating to CG&#160;:/
 xxd: I think my physics sim might somehow be off
 blaze96x: hey everyone
 Wontonimo: do you have a print or something for local?
 xxd: wdym?
 Wontonimo: hey blaze
 xxd: I generate it and print everything out in the first second xD
 xxd: i should see if my local sim aligns with CG sim
 Scarfield: im no expert, but it seems more reasonable to me to "fix" the genomes, to avoid them exploding
 Wontonimo: and you have a solution in first second?
 xxd: well i have one for at least one testcase
 Scarfield: i fix/correct mine after mutation though
 Scarfield: you could paste your sim here xxd, we can tell you if its wrong
 michaellan: was thinking of doing that, going to refer to Post Mortem's first
 michaellan: to make sure i didnt srew up
 Scarfield: also, what is your pop size, gene count and how many generations do you get?
 michaellan: 40, 40, 400
 michaellan: OH GOD
 michaellan: bruh
 michaellan: wait lemme try smth
 michaellan: basically i meant to have each gene last for 3 turns
 Scarfield: 40 genes is too little, the maps take more turns than that
 michaellan: but i realize I am applying the d_angle and d_thrust 3 times
 Scarfield: ah
 michaellan: when i mean to have it "hold" for 3 turns
 michaellan: maybe that will help converg more sensibly
 michaellan: alright, i can't find the post I used earlier, so here's the "next_move" function of my physics sim <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clbin.com/ipMx6">https://clbin.com/ipMx6</a>
 michaellan: oh originally i put the negative sign on n.a_x = -sinf(...
 Scarfield: looks correct, its often the ¬Ω * acceleration thats wrong, the only physics game on CG that works like that and not just adds the acc
 Scarfield: what i mean is that people often doesnt multiply acc with ¬Ω, what you are doing looks good. dont take my word for it though, i suck at reading others code xD
 Mocky-FS: Les code clash quand on d√©bute sur python, c'est assez chaud x)
 michaellan: i hate this
 michaellan: OH MY GOD
 michaellan: it worked on the first test case
 michaellan: xD
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 michaellan: not sure if it's any good though.. i wanna compare it to someone else's
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander</a>

 michaellan: what
 Scarfield: there an optim version of mars lander 2
 michaellan: yeah ik
 michaellan: okay my thing is like broken
 michaellan: its luck that it works on the first testcase&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: pro tip: view settings =&gt; Audio =&gt; off
 michaellan: UGHHH this is so infuriating
 eulerscheZahl: makes mars lander much better
 michaellan: my code is 600+ lines of spaghetti
 Wontonimo: yikes
 Wontonimo: spaghetti is no good
 Wontonimo: 600+ lines though, that sounds about right
 michaellan: spaghetti cuz all my debugging/visualizing code is coupled to the actual logic
 michaellan: and I used copy paste like a madman instead of properly abstracting
 michaellan: Also, was my assumption that the mars lander is a point incorrect?
 Westicles: 600 lines? just as long as you know most solutions are like 40 or less 
 michaellan: thanks westicles
 michaellan: :cry:
 Westicles: I'm not sure why you are being steered into a complicated solution
 michaellan: I want a solution that will automatically work for mars lander 3 and do well on the optim too
 Westicles: ML3 also has short solutions with a few ifs
 brok_38383: hola
 michaellan: crud
 michaellan: this is so sad
 brok_38383: alguien de latinoamerica
 brok_38383: no....?
 Wontonimo: brok_38383 english on this channel only 
 brok_38383: chale tabien&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: there are other language channels brok_38383
 Wontonimo: in spanish&#160;: ingl√©s solo en este canal
 michaellan: hay otros canales para otras lenguas
 brok_38383: ai clearly says world without english chat so i am free to speak the language that sticks to me
 michaellan: english is the language of the world
 brok_38383: clear no offense
 Astrobytes: No. It's a common channel for all nationalities, so they chose to use English in World.
 michaellan: I'm gonna try to add more "biased" genomes at the start
 brok_38383: algien que hable en espa√±ol...
 brok_38383: alo
 Scarfield: one thing i did today was to make the genomes more biased in the end, if a genome reaches the landing zone, change the angle to being upright at that point, instead of fully relying on the GA to find it
 brok_38383: chale&#160;:(
 michaellan: yeah I do do that scarfield, thanks for mentioning that
 Scarfield: okay, btw if your replay wasnt a lucky fluke, it was a pretty good score&#160;:)
 michaellan: I think that replay was incredibly lucky, i thikn the spaceship was *accidentally* upright the moment it hit the ground
 michaellan:&#160;:/
 Scarfield: xD
 Swyfti: good morning everyone
 Scarfield: tipStrobytes :wave"
 Scarfield: :wave:
 Astrobytes: Scarfolomew :wave:
 brok_38383: I already understood the world is the English chat sorry for the confusion and for interrupting your chat
 Astrobytes: OK, cool
 Swyfti: wait, are you guys saying that there are chats in other languages?
 brok_38383: yes
 Swyfti: i never knew that existed
 Swyfti: is there one for chinese
 Astrobytes: Daniel probably knew about it.
 michaellan: or maybe its daniel talking right now
 Swyfti: guys chill its not
 michaellan: omg i think i have a lead, my "left bank" and "right bank" genomes make 45-degree-angle lines into the ground instead of floating horizontally
 Swyfti: wdym
 michaellan: they dont float
 Swyfti: there are many things that do not float
 Astrobytes: But they all float down here :balloon:
 Astrobytes: And you'll float too! :clown:
 Scarfield: wdym by left bank genome?
 michaellan: i took wontonimo's advice and added some intentional genomes in my initialization
 TobiasA: *pennywise entered the chat*
 michaellan: namely one that floats off to the left and one that floats off to the right
 michaellan: i've fixed it, turns out it wasnt to do with my physics sim. so thats sad
 Scarfield: ah, 21deg and 4 thrust or something close to it?
 michaellan: close, 11deg
 Scarfield: "close" :p
 AllYourTrees: whoa royale causing big changes in c4 top
 Scarfield: yea saw that too
 AllYourTrees: thats crazy
 michaellan: what did he do?
 Astrobytes: NN'd it probably
 Westicles: added cheese
 TobiasA: caused big changes in c4
 Scarfield: gotta try and join the NN club soon, and be part of the 0.5%
 AllYourTrees: a bunch of players who haven't submitted moved around cause of him lol
 michaellan: ah i see
 michaellan: also, why is there only wood league for it?
 AllYourTrees: :shrug:
 Astrobytes: Community multis only have wood leagues
 Astrobytes: Usually we have Wood 2 to get used to the game, and the boss filters out random bots so you get better quality in the top league
 Astrobytes: (random as in just pick a random given move, no sim+search, no real bot)
 xxd: gotcha
 xxd: everyone's bitboarding for c4 right?
 Astrobytes: About 98% of the community-made board games involve bitboarding
 Scarfield: xxd if you want your pod to hover sideways, it should be 22deg and 4thrust, assuming you have no vertical vel
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/576036849">https://www.codingame.com/replay/576036849</a>
 xxd: oh, weird
 xxd: okay let me change those
 xxd: but i've been sufficiently distracted into c4 now
 xxd: a basic MCTS doesnt seem that hard, bitboarding seems straightforward but i wonder if theres some fast bit operation to perform the move (i.e., "drop" the circle)
 MSmits: |= 1 &lt;&lt; index&#160;?
 martinpapa69: there is a template in c++ called bitset
 TobiasA: yesh
 xxd: i meant like, given you want to drop it in the 7th slot, which square does it end up in
 MSmits: |= 1 &lt;&lt; 7&#160;?
 MSmits: no
 xxd: huh
 TobiasA: yesh
 MSmits: |= 1 &lt;&lt; 6 sry
 xxd: do you not store the whole board in an int64 or something?
 MSmits: if you're doing uttt, then mostly people use 9x uint16 for each player
 Scarfield: depends on the way you "setup" your bitboard, bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right could all be set as 1 (and so on), different preferences
 xxd: I"m talking about C4
 MSmits: ohhh
 xxd: sorry
 MSmits: well then it's two uint64_t
 xxd: yeah
 MSmits: let me find out how i apply a move, sec
 xxd: but im still talking about how you know where the circle lands
 eulerscheZahl: "About 98% of the community-made board games involve bitboarding"that's 49 out of 50. There aren't even that many community games and I can easily tell you 2 that work without bitboards&#160;;)
 xxd: cuz the exact slot depends on how many previously have been dropped in that slot
 xxd: and it can be done with a while loop but that sounds incredibly sloow
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: I stand corrected. Did you know that 75% of statistics are made up on the spot? :P
 martinpapa69: including this one&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 martinpapa69: oh
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for explaining the joke
 MSmits: xxd I don't actually apply moves this way
 xxd:&#160;:/
 MSmits: I don't ever "choose" a slot
 MSmits: I choose a square on the entire board and only consider the lowest ones to be valid squares
 xxd: oh
 MSmits: which may seem like it's the same, but it's a different approach
 xxd: but that uses a lot more rng s
 xxd: so its only valid if the square to the right is filled, basically
 xxd: or if its the bottom one
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/">https://yare.io/</a>i wonder if i should get into this or not
 MSmits: I'm trying to find a snippet of code i can share thats not completely obscure
 eulerscheZahl: downside: it's javascript. and i'm not sure if there's an easy way to code offline
 MSmits: xxd this is useful:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fe38c0b-50a5-4914-ac1d-fa5a95c63c97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4fe38c0b-50a5-4914-ac1d-fa5a95c63c97</a>
 MSmits: you add up both player boards
 MSmits: p1 | p2
 MSmits: and feed it to this function
 eulerscheZahl: random match: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/d1/lwegthe2dn2">https://yare.io/d1/lwegthe2dn2</a>
 MSmits: then it returns the valid squares you can play
 xxd: i'm gonna need to ponder this for a while
 MSmits: it works as follows
 MSmits: (flipped ^ (flipped &lt;&lt; 9))
 andyescobar: Hello guys does anyone know how to translate this c++ code into java for(int j = 0; j &lt; ((digits[i]) + (i == 0)); j++)
 MSmits: this compares  each tile with the tile above
 MSmits: if they are the same, it is 0, if they are different it is 1
 MSmits: the places where it is different, is where the allowed move sits
 michaellan: thats fucking genius
 MSmits: struct came up with this one
 eulerscheZahl: that part should compile in java too andyescobar, doesn't it?
 Scarfield: MSmits the biz wiz
 michaellan: i think you may need to cast if necessary andyescobar 
 MSmits: no no, not me this time
 Swyfti: is there any real similarity between java and javascript?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md">https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md</a>
 MSmits: xxd btw, if you calculate the "allowed moves" one time and just update it, it could be faster
 eulerscheZahl: both java and javascript are somewhat based on C syntax
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/bitset</a>&#160;:/
 michaellan: ah thats true, but its literally some bit operations
 michaellan: no one likes bitset martinpapa69 
 Swyfti: C was my first computing language :sigh:
 eulerscheZahl: as similar as "english and german use the same alphabet (mostly, german has √§√∂√º√ü)
 MSmits: true
 michaellan: so its like sacrificing another 8 bytes in your node, for a tiny speedup
 michaellan: i'll try writing both
 MSmits: wait, what is your node like?
 michaellan: Wontonimo gave me a random_bit function that uses SSE instructions lol , i think i will use that here
 michaellan: I havent started to write it, but just thinking about it it would probably have 2 int64s for the players, win/visit, parent pointer, heap array of children pointers
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f78ee5bd-96dc-4844-81ed-9de52458cd72">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f78ee5bd-96dc-4844-81ed-9de52458cd72</a>
 MSmits: this is all i have
 michaellan: I might also remove parent pointer and instead do a thing with a path array
 michaellan: ah you use the node pool as well
 MSmits: no need for a parent pointer
 michaellan: i think a lot of the top people do it
 MSmits: and no need for a pointer to anything but the first child
 MSmits: all of them
 michaellan: is the node pool on the heap?
 eulerscheZahl: you waste some space if you only visit the node once
 Scarfield: thanks for the legal moves, i stole it&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's a giant global array xxd
 eulerscheZahl: and you store the full board in each node? not generate it again from the root?
 MSmits: in this game i do eulerscheZahl, i never tried to do it otherwise
 MSmits: in some games it's better to store on the node
 MSmits: i coded this bot in a day
 michaellan: Lol, the available moves is more advanced than what is shown in that github markdown file someone linked above
 MSmits: you can be sure that if it comes from struct, it will be *very* hard to find better
 michaellan: Is it sized at compile time? what happens if you run out of space? MSmits 
 andyescobar: hello guys does anyone know how to translate this code into java 
 andyescobar: for(int j = 0; j &lt; ((digits[i]) + (i == 0)); j++)
 eulerscheZahl: it crashes
 MSmits: it's sized at compile time or in the first second, not sure. But I reset the tree when i run out
 michaellan: darn
 MSmits: you can only run out if you reuse tree between turns
 michaellan: is it like 1 million or something
 eulerscheZahl: andyescobar i already answered you. why would this snippet not work in Java already?
 MSmits: way more
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 michaellan: 10m?
 michaellan: wowzer
 MSmits: it's almost all the memory you get
 Scarfield: and you run out o0
 michaellan: msmits thanks so much
 michaellan: im gonna try writing it now
 eulerscheZahl: just write (int)2.5e7
 eulerscheZahl: much more readable
 MSmits: i sometimes run out, but not so much in C4 i think
 eulerscheZahl: or does C++ support 25_000_000?
 MSmits: bandas is horrible for running out of nodes. Happens in oware too i think
 MSmits: but you can just reset
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl no idea
 michaellan: does the global array also have a corresponding "end" pointer
 andyescobar: I am sorry 
 MSmits: and yeah. I also still write some bit literals as decimals
 Scarfield: sure, how many rollouts do you get you remember?
 andyescobar: I was stuck in the program
 MSmits: for C4&#160;?
 MSmits: I can check
 Scarfield: ye
 michaellan: is the type of the global pool Node[] or Node*[]
 MSmits: wait rollouts are meaningless because of how i rollout
 MSmits: I rollout form each child
 eulerscheZahl: how many single steps then?
 Scarfield: after expansion, so do i actually
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe628476-f0a4-422a-84f9-584120b1e591">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fe628476-f0a4-422a-84f9-584120b1e591</a>
 MSmits: 4
 MSmits: 3 million sry
 MSmits: on first turn
 MSmits: (steps
 michaellan: holy 
 michaellan: thanks MSmits 
 eulerscheZahl: 600k here&#160;:(
 MSmits: wait, no
 MSmits: it's 3 million expansions I think
 MSmits: children expanded sry
 MSmits: so 3 million / 9 expansions
 andyescobar: hello eulerscheZahl this does not work in Java it keeps showing an error of bitwise operator undefined
 MSmits: 356k rollouts, a rollout being 9 children simmed to end of game, which means  3 million random rollouts
 xxd: fix the error
 Scarfield: if you rollout for each child, its also your rollout count i guess, im at 1.5mil 
 michaellan: why do you roll out each child
 michaellan: i dont recall that being described in anything i read
 MSmits: sometimes it performs a bit better
 MSmits: you get less rollouts, but more statistics
 michaellan: so u still backpropagate each rollout etc
 eulerscheZahl: (i == 0)this should be (i == 0&#160;? 1&#160;: 0)in Java
 MSmits: this is worthwhile if your selection function is a bottleneck
 MSmits: and in my case it is
 Scarfield: there are many different ways to do it. i expand every child, rollout every child, instead of only expanding 1 child
 michaellan: I see
 eulerscheZahl: same for (j == 6) and (j == 8)
 eulerscheZahl: == 8 )
 michaellan: oh is it the rng thats the bottleneck?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e7b339c-984a-41ae-8e43-481523786b44">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8e7b339c-984a-41ae-8e43-481523786b44</a>
 michaellan: or the UCT
 MSmits: uct
 michaellan: is UCT generally the bottleneck?
 P111111: hi
 MSmits: xxd it depends on how expensive the random sim is and how long the random sim takes
 michaellan: this pool method is so elegant
 MSmits: near the end of the game, your selection tree is most of the tree and the random sim is very cheap
 MSmits: in the beginning, random sim is the main bottleneck
 michaellan: instead ofNode* you could also have used integer for index in node pool right, just confirming
 MSmits: because it takes so long
 Scarfield: yea i was thinking aplying some variable depth-rollout thing, but meh
 michaellan: I see
 michaellan: tree grows deeper
 MSmits: yeah Scarfield things like that can help
 MSmits: but my experience is that looking for improvements like that is really frustrating
 MSmits: because most of the time it doesn't
 michaellan: can re-writing it in C be faster
 MSmits: only if you misuse C++
 Wontonimo: xxd, if you rollout every node upon creation, then you don't have to account for zero visits in any of your UCB calculations
 MSmits: thats true
 michaellan: darn
 michaellan: one less conditional branch damn
 MSmits: and also you're supposed to pick the first child randomly according to basic mcts
 michaellan: that prob makes a nontrivial difference
 michaellan: oh
 michaellan: i originally did that
 MSmits: and if you just rollout from each, you dont have to worry about it
 Wontonimo: pretty trivial difference
 michaellan: but i watched a video that just said pick the first one
 MSmits: mind you, i never pick randomly
 MSmits: it's not really worth it
 michaellan: and i did around the same
 MSmits: yeah
 Wontonimo: picking the first one is GREAT for debugging
 MSmits: but when you rollout all children you dont even need to worry about the order
 Wontonimo: so, yeah, do that until you work out all the bugs
 MSmits: oh xxd, 1 piece of advice. When you create your pool, don't initialize the nodes
 MSmits: so dont do "childcount = 0"
 Wontonimo: very important
 MSmits: otherwise you will be initializing 700 mb of memory
 MSmits: and time out
 Wontonimo: make a function called something like "init" that does it
 MSmits: only when using the node
 Wontonimo: ^^ that
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5ff86e8-8128-40d5-a4e6-a5f7e7be84a7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5ff86e8-8128-40d5-a4e6-a5f7e7be84a7</a>
 michaellan: super confused
 MSmits: we just mean the properties
 MSmits: look at the node i shared
 MSmits: none of the parts of the node have a value
 MSmits: they are all unset
 MSmits: well in fact they are set to whatever is in memory
 darkhorse64: Another good reason to rollout every child is that near the end you get more terminal nodes and your solver performs better
 MSmits: oh, yeah that's true
 michaellan: theres too much info to take in.. i feel like i should be taking notes
 AllYourTrees: lol
 Wontonimo: holy cow xxd!  you're 152nd in legend for UTTT&#160;!!!
 Wontonimo: congrats&#160;!!
 MSmits: yeah that's nicely done
 michaellan: yeah... i told you a while ago
 michaellan: thanks
 AllYourTrees: smits when do you do solver stuff? didn't see it in the backprop fn you linked earlier
 Wontonimo: i forget :sad:
 Swyfti: :disappointed_relieved:
 AllYourTrees: :eyes:
 MSmits: separately AllYourTrees
 michaellan: C4/UTTT/dumb bitboarding MCTS is more fun to me than hard physics problems :angry:
 MSmits: 			if (finished)				SolverPropagation(-bestResult);			else				MultiBackPropagation(startSign * rolloutWins, selectedState-&gt;childMax);
 MSmits: bah no pastebin
 AllYourTrees: ahh okay
 MiyamuraIzumi: not yet write MCTS&#160;:(
 michaellan: sorry MSmits but I still don't get what you mean by "MSmits&gt; so dont do "childcount = 0""
 Wontonimo: have you tried flat MC yet MiyamuraIzumi&#160;?
 MSmits: ok separate example xxd
 MSmits: say you're creating  a 2d vector
 MSmits: struct Vector {  int x = 0; int y = 0 };
 MSmits: struct Vector {  int x; int y; };
 michaellan: ah
 MSmits: this works too
 michaellan: so latter here is better since it doesnt init
 MSmits: but it doesnt set the memory to 0
 MSmits: exactly
 MiyamuraIzumi: I don't do any bot game for now
 michaellan: gotcha
 michaellan: so 
 MSmits: normally this is bad practice
 michaellan: i put it in constructor instead?
 MSmits: but we dont code normal here
 MiyamuraIzumi: feel lazy&#160;:(
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: you dont construct
 MSmits: you set by function
 michaellan: OH
 darkhorse64: We are fast and furious
 MSmits: it's not a constructor
 michaellan: i have a fake constructor
 michaellan: that is never automatically called
 MSmits: yeah
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/006b205b-6d85-4d30-b181-e0c3fa7a9214">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/006b205b-6d85-4d30-b181-e0c3fa7a9214</a>
 michaellan: smart lads
 Scarfield: this is what i do, and what you mean right?
 michaellan: how 2 be more like u guys
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f5f263bd-2e26-4330-b755-388eaf0a0165">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f5f263bd-2e26-4330-b755-388eaf0a0165</a>
 michaellan: yeah i think thats what msmits describes
 MSmits: more info for you
 MSmits: makes things more clear maybe
 michaellan: why you call it setChild
 michaellan: that seems like the wrong name
 Wontonimo: i call mine "init"
 MSmits: i am setting the node thats already there in the pool
 MSmits: init is maybe better
 MSmits: dunno
 michaellan: true
 MSmits: init has an issue though
 MSmits: nodes can be reused
 michaellan: when
 MSmits: when your tree runs out
 MSmits: and you start again at index 1
 michaellan: 0*
 michaellan: or 1?
 michaellan: what
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: the root is 0
 MSmits: the first child of the root will be 1
 michaellan: but dont you set the root again too
 MSmits: sure, i have a separate set root function though&#160;:)
 michaellan: i see
 MSmits: wait no i dont for this one
 michaellan: o
 MSmits: i have so many boardgame bots
 michaellan: haha
 MSmits: they are all slightly different
 michaellan: by the way
 michaellan: where do you teach computer science?
 MSmits: in a highschool in my country
 MSmits: 15-18 yr olds
 shayah_goba: how do you make a string start with the letter 0 in python
 michaellan: wow
 michaellan: those kids are lucky
 MSmits: i like to think so :0
 shayah_goba: how do you make a string start with the letter 0 in python
 michaellan: nah you cant
 michaellan: do that
 Wontonimo: don't spam shayah_goba, just be patient
 StevenV: only know Heuristic&#160;:)
 shayah_goba: dam so i just gotta give up
 michaellan: s = '0' + s[1:]
 Wontonimo: thanks xxd
 michaellan: (strings are immutable)
 MSmits: aren't they in most languages?
 michaellan: shayah_goba: are you in some dumb clash?
 MSmits: C# has the stringbuilder
 michaellan: yeah, not perl thoug
 MSmits: strings are misleading like that as you generally do a lot of += on strings
 michaellan: I've been using a separet State struct and a Node struct
 MSmits: but you're making a new string when you do that
 michaellan: but i dont think thats necessary now
 michaellan: ya
 michaellan: i think c++ might optimize it sometimes?
 michaellan: not too sure about that
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: btw, every time someone says struct here, we're ping a guy named struct :P
 MSmits: pinging
 michaellan: isnt he taking a break from CG though?
 michaellan: sorry struc-t
 Scarfield: but hes not here(?)
 michaellan: also MSmits do you use this:
 michaellan: uint16_t random_bit(uint16_t available_moves)
 michaellan: { return __builtin_ctzl(__builtin_ia32_pdep_si(1UL &lt;&lt; randval(__builtin_popcountl(available_moves)), available_moves));
 michaellan: oops i thought that would pastebin
 MSmits: i use pdep yes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/17ac554f-fd37-49fa-becf-df0ddaa9e40c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/17ac554f-fd37-49fa-becf-df0ddaa9e40c</a>
 StevenV: any good resource for learning those algorithms on CG bot game?
 MSmits: we learned from chatting here and all over google
 MSmits: google being synonymous with the interwebz
 StevenV:&#160;:)
 xxd: can i see your fastrand please? or is that classified
 MSmits: but you can often find some tutorial somewhere
 MSmits: not classified
 MSmits: these are standard functions i usually have. I came up with none of them
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c06f49c-4e37-4827-bc3f-a77dd5bf40f1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9c06f49c-4e37-4827-bc3f-a77dd5bf40f1</a>
 xxd: nice
 MSmits: the xorshift isnt used in this c4 bot
 xxd: astroconsultant showed me 3 of those
 MSmits: but i usually use that for hashing
 xxd: for UTTT
 xxd: ah
 xxd: wait why does the fastrand not do anything random anywhere :rofl:
 MSmits: it's pseudorandom
 xxd: i feel like im learning the dark arts
 MSmits: it just makes a sequence of numbers
 MSmits: that is sort of random
 xxd: i see
 xxd: like a merseene twister sorta thing
 StevenV: any suggestion for fall-challenge-2020&#160;? I want to be in legend for this game
 MSmits: exactly  that yes
 MSmits: its 2 to 5 times faster than normal c++ random
 xxd: darn
 MSmits: somewhere in that range
 michaellan: probably even more of a speedup for me since i currently use uniform_int_distribution
 michaellan: which probably has some overhead
 Scarfield: but its 2-5 times less random
 MSmits: never tried that
 MSmits: oh yeah Scarfield it is that, but i  did some tests and it had a good enough distribution
 MSmits: karliso uses a way worse random in uttt thats even faster
 Scarfield: xD i was just joking
 xxd: Lols
 xxd: how do you do faster than that
 MSmits: i think karliso has a 255 sized array with numbers in there that he just reuses all the time
 xxd: wait, the int Mod parameter is just the exclusive maximum bound right?
 xxd: BRuh
 MSmits: and if the number he finds is too high, he just caps it to the highest allowed move
 Scarfield: yea
 xxd: thats literally illegal
 xxd: why does he not mod it intsead of something
 xxd: or something*
 MSmits: well in uttt you have 9 squares
 MSmits: say 6 and 8 are taken
 MSmits: then there are 7 moves left
 xxd: oh thats true
 MSmits: so if his random finds 7, it's too high
 xxd: nvm
 MSmits: so he'll just take the highest possible
 MSmits: i was shocked to find he did that, but it works apparently since his bot is as good as the best NN';s
 Scarfield: how do you actually determine if something is "random enough"?
 michaellan: you click "Test in Arena"
 Scarfield: xD
 AllYourTrees: lmao
 MSmits: well 1 thing you can do is just run it 100 million times and if you only have 9 possible moves you can see if they are equally distributed
 MSmits: thats not enough of course
 MSmits: I am sure there are other tests
 MSmits: but i am no expert
 MSmits: but if that test fails, you know your random sucks already
 Scarfield: true
 Scarfield: xxd are you a CS student/graduated, or just benefitting from eating avocadoes?
 michaellan: i'm not sure how i'm supposed to pick from either option
 michaellan: i like avocados and I'm a CS sstudent
 michaellan: I don't like guacamole though
 Astrobytes: Heathen1
 Astrobytes: Heathen!
 Scarfield:&#160;!
 Astrobytes: avos were MADE for guacamole
 Wontonimo: and toast with feta
 Scarfield: xD
 michaellan: MSmits: what is the point of xorshift?
 Wontonimo: to solve the nintendo challenge
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift</a>
 michaellan: my bad, i thought "xorshift" was a made up term
 Astrobytes: Nice and fast some of them
 Scarfield: anyway, im off, enjoy your evening folks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Later Scarfield, same to you&#160;:)
 Scarfield: ty cya
 MSmits: bye Scarfield
 MSmits: xxd xorshift can turn your c4 boards into hash keys
 MSmits: p1 ^ xorshift(p2)   or use xorshift(p1) ^xorshift(p2)
 MSmits: if you dont use it, you will get hash collisions
 MSmits: especially since p1 and p2 are mutually exclusive, so when you xor them normally, you just get a lot of 1's  where the pieces are
 xxd: DAMN
 xxd: i get what u mean
 xxd: also by scarfield i wasnt looking at chat but hes probably gone now
 xxd: bye*
 MSmits: btw, I don't use hashing for C4
 xxd: yeah idk why you'd ned it
 xxd: oh
 xxd: transpositions
 MSmits: it's just those 5 lines are in each bot
 MSmits: yes 
 MSmits:  i use it for transpositions sometimes
 michaellan: how does that work
 michaellan: do you just link to the same node
 michaellan: in the pool
 MSmits: in mcts it is really really messy
 MSmits: but yes, you set your childindex to the same node
 MSmits: so they share children
 michaellan: okok
 MSmits: but i've never found it to work well in  mcts
 michaellan: also
 MSmits: in minimax it's great
 michaellan: why do you shift by 9
 MSmits: thats a row
 michaellan: wouldnt you shift by 8 to get the next
 MSmits: 1 row up
 michaellan: oh crud
 michaellan: its 0-8 xD
 MSmits: ye confusing sometimes
 michaellan: wait so int64 is litearlly perfect
 michaellan: for this
 MSmits: i've had my fair share of bug do to that particular off by 1 error
 michaellan: this couldnt have been a coincidence
 MSmits: due to
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: 8x8 could have been chosen for c4
 MSmits: but 8x8 is solved 
 MSmits: 9x7 isnt 
 michaellan: REALLY?
 MSmits: yes
 michaellan: i need to tell my brother tha
 michaellan: i told him c4 was solved
 MSmits: it is
 MSmits: 8x8 and smaller
 michaellan: huh
 michaellan: oh ok
 MSmits: normal c4 is 6x7
 MSmits: easily solved
 MSmits: btw, our version of C4 implements pie rule
 Wontonimo: what that?
 MSmits: player 1 starts and player 2 gets to decide to keep playing or take over p1's board 
 Wontonimo: oh, right
 Wontonimo: i like that
 martinpapa69: does that make it less-easily solvable&#160;?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: far less
 Wontonimo: i say we make that part of every board game
 xxd: wait
 xxd: taht seems overpowerd
 MSmits: if re curse were here he'd say thats lazy game design Wontonimo
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i heard MSmits
 Wontonimo: i say it's smart
 xxd: wouldn't you always steal?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: p1 will play a crap move if you always steal
 MSmits: the corners are losing moves
 xxd: oh
 xxd: well this makes my implementation a bit omre complicated
 MSmits: so he will play the most balanced move
 MSmits: effectively auto-balancing the game
 MSmits: if a balanced starting move exists
 xxd: how do you add this in MCTS though
 xxd: like
 Wontonimo: you don't
 xxd: the average?
 xxd: the median child
 martinpapa69: you check top players replay
 Astrobytes: didn't you figure out the most balanced move MSmits?
 Wontonimo: just hard code it in the first move with if statements
 martinpapa69: and hardcode
 MSmits: yeah it's 1 and 7 Astrobytes
 xxd: xD okay bigbrain
 MSmits: after 50+ million games simmed and many solved branches i am 99.7% sure that move 1 and 7 are solved as draw 
 Wontonimo: if you want to find the "bestish" first move, just run MCTS locally with 5 minutes of compute, copy the probabilities of the first move into an array and copy that into your game
 Wontonimo: now you have a reusable concept for any game that has the pie
 xxd: wait so if you "Steal", you basically switch sides on the table right
 MSmits: yeah
 Wontonimo: yes
 xxd: why is the problem statement's explanation so bad
 xxd: wait but in wood 2
 xxd: should i just do best
 xxd: and hopethey dont steal
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: 3 and 5 are best
 MSmits: 4 is second best
 xxd: oh seriously, not 4?
 xxd: interesting
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: probably both solved as win though
 MSmits: if we were to solve them
 xxd: is UTTT solved too
 Wontonimo: yeah.  wood 2 you can go middle, then random other than to prefer a winning move
 MSmits: uttt is not solved, but i've done so much testing for that game that i am convinced that if you solved it, p1 would win
 Wontonimo: without pie
 MSmits: pie rule would make it a draw i think
 MSmits: there are several bad starting moves that would lose the advantage for p1
 MSmits: there;s 15 unique starters for uttt
 michaellan: the pie rule is so interesting
 MSmits: and only 1 of them has to be solved as a draw
 MSmits: for pie rule to make the entire game a draw
 michaellan: facts
 MSmits: yeah pie rule is pretty neat
 MSmits: do you know where the name comes from?
 MSmits: say we have to share a pie. I get to slice it in half. You get to pick which half you get. I would be forced to slice it up exactly in the middle, or i get a smaller piece.
 MSmits: they use this trick with children
 MSmits: so they dont fight over dessert 
 michaellan: damn
 michaellan: i watched a video where they explained how to do pie rule with 3 people
 michaellan: it involved crumbs or something
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: well thats too advanced for me
 michaellan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaMKInkV7Vs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaMKInkV7Vs</a>
 MSmits: jeez
 MSmits: thats way too complicated!
 michaellan: theres no cake for anyone at the end :rofl: all crumbs

 TobiasA: i like that second one i did the interactive tutorial
 michaellan: wait
 TobiasA: ooouuu the first one looks neat
 michaellan: why are you guys using floats for win/visits
 michaellan: larger range? more flexibility with scoring?
 MSmits: so as not to have to cast when doing uct
 MSmits: casting is expensive
 michaellan: bruh im so dumb, how did i not think of this
 michaellan: thx
 MSmits: i spent months in real time on this :P
 MSmits: it's not dumb at all
 MSmits: we all run into the same issues
 MSmits: we're just dumping all this accumulated knowledge on you all at once :P
 michaellan: i think the way everyone has similar setups is almost like a GA
 michaellan: everyone talks to each other = crossover
 MSmits: yeah, thats true
 michaellan: and we converge at the best most optimized solutions
 michaellan: that is so satisfying to think about
 MSmits: though, we also converge too quickly sometimes
 michaellan: :thinking:
 MSmits: if everyone tells you how to do something
 MSmits: you dont try other stuff
 MSmits: so sometimes someone stubborn comes in
 MSmits: and teaches us all new things
 tohshiiki: hi
 michaellan: thats why we have mutations
 MSmits: too much sharing can be harmful to creativity
 michaellan: maybe one day i'll be a mutation
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: sure, you be a mutant, thats cool
 MSmits: you already got two x's

 Astrobytes: MSmits :D
 tohshiiki: ik im on a coding website not the chat tho
 Astrobytes: wanna kick?
 BlaiseEbuth: ban
 Wontonimo: i'm okay with one more strike
 TobiasA: imagine getting lost on the internet and ending up here:joy:
 MSmits: maybe he was looking for information about vaccines with fetus in them
 michaellan: lmao what
 TobiasA: :joy:
 MSmits: hey that's a thing
 MSmits: well, that people believe it, is a thing
 MSmits: anti vax theories would be funny if they weren't also depressing
 BlaiseEbuth: No more moderation on this chat...
 MSmits: astro does fine i think blaise
 Astrobytes: No it's true in some cases (I believe I explained this a while ago) in that fetal cells are used
 Astrobytes: in some vaccines
 MSmits: ah yes, i should specify
 MSmits: they think it's aborted fetus
 MSmits: from abortions
 michaellan: that is weird
 Astrobytes: well, cell lines derived from aborted fetus cells. Yes that's the case. From decades ago.
 michaellan: ._.
 MSmits: really? Thats interesting, it's not the covid vaccine though
 Astrobytes: The cell lines are just cells grown from those.
 Astrobytes: I think one or two companies use them.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's like the babies foreskins used in moisturizer to make it more creamy.
 MSmits: oh right, Johnson does apparently
 Astrobytes: And I think those cell lines were grown from 2 fetuses
 MSmits: it was my assumption that the idea was total nonsense
 Wontonimo: I was curious about running out of nodes in my node pool.  Just added output for that and I at most use 10% of my pool
 michaellan: wow
 michaellan: what is your size?
 Astrobytes: there are a couple of others that are grown from the odd other fetus here and there but from a long time ago.
 Ashishsr123: what is the code to print debug messages&#160;?
 Wontonimo: 30,000,000
 xxd: just print to stderr
 MSmits: wait, but there's no microchip right Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: The vaccine itself doesn't actually contain any of that though MSmits
 Ashishsr123: ok
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: it's used for production and testing
 Astrobytes: But they are used to develop and test
 Astrobytes: yes
 xxd: but what about the 5G
 xxd: do they put 5G in vaccines
 Astrobytes: It's pretty standard practice MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: no telemetry data for the producer?
 eulerscheZahl: but MS does that too!
 MSmits: I think G is part of rna/dna so lots of G's  in mrna vaccine&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: have you seen GATTACA?
 MSmits: nope
 Astrobytes: xxd: Of course! I'm streaming all my data directly to Bill Gates, Hilary Clinton and a secret cabal of baby-eating lizard-people
 Wontonimo: xxd, instead of rolling out all children, I do 2 rollouts per child.  It's a tradeoff that gave me 4 or so ranks
 Astrobytes: GATTACA is one of my favourite movies
 xxd: nice
 eulerscheZahl: my favorite is probably Idiocrazy
 xxd: is a 2^63 size win lookup table too big
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Idiocracy is up there for sure
 xxd: so i gotta loop and stuff to find wins -_-
 Astrobytes: back soon, cat just woke up
 MSmits: my oware lookup locally is around 2^36
 MSmits: and thats 57 GB
 xxd: wtf
 xxd: 2^36 bools?
 MSmits: no bits
 MSmits: 7 bits per state
 xxd: i think my intuition is horribly off
 MSmits: wait i think i am a power of 3 off
 MSmits: 2 ^39
 eulerscheZahl: 2^36 = 64GB
 MSmits: yeah 2^36 bytes is
 MSmits: i was thinking bits
 MSmits: got confused
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: only internet providers count in bits instead of bytes
 MSmits: higher numbers = better
 dmin: gotta pump those ads up 
 martinpapa69: brand new 2000ml coca cola!
 eulerscheZahl: my physics teacher once told me that there's a difference between 2l and 2000ml
 eulerscheZahl: it's the precision: 2l might as well be 1.6 or 2.4
 Wontonimo: and my math teacher told me they are the same
 Wontonimo: and my religion teach told me not to trust either because they can't agree
 jacek: engineer would round down to 0
 xxd: frick i got sniped 
 TobiasA: why?
 xxd: MSmits: why do you set visits to 1 in SetChild
 xxd: the backpropagate will set it again no?
 xxd: i'm gonna set mine to zero cuz thats the way im used to it at least
 MSmits: because i know i'll be rolling out from all o fthem
 MSmits: that way i dont have to set the visits 
 MSmits: during the rollouts
 MSmits: so only do this when you rollout from each child after expansion
 xxd: so u just start from the parent of the node
 xxd: when u backpropagate visits?
 MSmits: i start at the root
 MSmits: it's basically forward propagation i guess
 xxd: oh i see
 xxd: i just realize you dont store a "player" variable and its not necessary
 MSmits: doesnt really matter if you start at the root or the leaf, as long as you get the sign correctly
 xxd: like the current player
 MSmits: yeah thats not necessary
 xxd: made things eaiser when i was learning it at first
 MSmits: selectedcount &amp; 1 tells you the player
 MSmits: even or odd
 AllYourTrees: finally cleaned up my solver backprop to not have to visit all children every time
 MSmits: all children?
 AllYourTrees: when i backpropped before i scanned all the children of each node to check if they were all solved or not
 AllYourTrees: but now im just tracking best found so far and number of solved children
 MSmits: why do you need to track the number?
 AllYourTrees: to know when all of them are solved?
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: so you're keeping this number on the node?/
 AllYourTrees: for losses don't you need to know all children are proven losses?
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da53dddb-35b0-42f9-b060-9b0266168dd0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/da53dddb-35b0-42f9-b060-9b0266168dd0</a>
 MSmits: i never even considered that
 AllYourTrees: requires you never visit a solved node though
 MSmits: I just loop over all children and if i encounter a nonsolved node, i stop solving
 AllYourTrees: ya thats what i did before
 MSmits: is your way better?
 MSmits: your new way
 AllYourTrees: bumped up a couple of ranks on clobber
 MSmits: thats a very bad test though
 AllYourTrees: whats a good test
 MSmits: leaderboard is very unreliable
 MSmits: a performance measurement i guess
 AllYourTrees: yeah it was a performance boost for me
 MSmits: well thats all i need to know because then it can only be an improvement
 AllYourTrees: well
 AllYourTrees: performance is kinda inconsistent when i play in ide
 MSmits: yes
 AllYourTrees: haven't tested locally or anything lol
 AllYourTrees: either way i feel better about doing it that way so im keeping it :P
 MSmits: if you do it locally, you would need to pick a state thats solvable and solve it with both methods and time it
 MSmits: it's a cool find
 MSmits: never heard someone mention this 
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 MSmits: so 2 extra bytes?
 YurkovAS: store bestSolved and numberSolved in parent node?
 MSmits: yeah
 AllYourTrees: ya to both
 martinpapa69: i keep a bitset&lt;children_count&gt; unsolved_children; on nodes
 MSmits: never used bitset
 martinpapa69: so i can avaoid messing up my count, if i accidentally visit a solved child
 martinpapa69: int8_t then
 martinpapa69: whatever
 YurkovAS: bitset is slow
 martinpapa69: i do actually visit solved children
 MSmits: I completely abandon those children
 martinpapa69: thats not a good idea
 martinpapa69: you can overestimate nodes
 MSmits: I don't want to waste an entire selection iteration just to end on an already fully explored branch
 aayux: i am new to c++ need help where should i stary
 MSmits: i started c++ by starting at C# :P
 MSmits: has similar syntax, but doesnt turn you off programming entirely like C++ frustration can do&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: the paper actually mentions solved children nodes
 AllYourTrees: i vote rust
 AllYourTrees: :D
 martinpapa69: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/uctloa.pdf</a>
 MSmits: yeah, i know it
 martinpapa69: you should never just "abandon" the,m
 MSmits: their code is bad
 MSmits: i just mean i dont visit them
 martinpapa69: ye i dont down ther on a solved branch
 martinpapa69: i stop at the last nonsolved node
 martinpapa69: and sometimes backprop solved children
 MSmits: ok let me put it this way
 MSmits: do you always expand something, when you go down the tree
 martinpapa69: no. if my ucb selects a solved node, i backprop it
 MSmits: ah see, i feel thats wasteful
 MSmits: you're all the way down there, why not explore a bit further
 martinpapa69: i use alpha zero tho. 80% of the cpu time is NN
 MSmits: you can always decide to backprop the solved node anyways
 MSmits: but still explore something else
 martinpapa69: its just make my mcts more accure with a small waste
 martinpapa69: accurate*
 YurkovAS: i'm ignore solved in ucb selection
 martinpapa69: dunno if its a good idea never tried. 
 MSmits: well i tried in uttt to select solved draws but wasnt better
 MSmits: i also tried to some tricks to pick nonsolved nodes and reduce the bias
 MSmits: but it was usually a small performance hit and no real gain
 MSmits: so i just select nonsolved nodes now and accept having the bias
 martinpapa69: one thing that bothers me more is node duplicates
 MSmits: what do you mean
 MSmits: transpositions?
 martinpapa69: ye
 MSmits: it's really difficult to deal with those in mcts
 MSmits: never seen it work in a cg bot
 martinpapa69: i wont to link them to the same node somehow
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: it worked for me 1 time
 MSmits: in yavalath, to solve sooner, but in early game it is costly
 MSmits: what i do is i share the same childindex to the node pool
 Wontonimo: if it's all pointers and no pooling, then it isn't an issue.  if you've got pooling and you allocate the children in a block, it is a little more tricky
 MSmits: yeah you can hash the childindex
 martinpapa69: pooling is necessary
 MSmits: oh and put the childcount in there too
 MSmits: or you will have to re-expand to find out
 martinpapa69: or make children a smart pointer, with ref counter
 Wontonimo: why ref counter?
 martinpapa69: oh nvm im talking about children node invalidation
 MSmits: martinpapa69 i use this in yavalath:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/86f85041-36ff-4490-92fc-e336d0a6a62c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/86f85041-36ff-4490-92fc-e336d0a6a62c</a>
 MSmits: value being poorly named, it's just the childindex
 MSmits: the child count isnt needed in yavalath as its just the number of empty spaces on the board
 MSmits: when i expanding i first check if the state is in the unordered set
 MSmits: if so i take the information from there and keep on selecting
 MSmits: not expanding at all
 MSmits: it might be better to create your own hashtable, unordered set is slower than most (this is an old bot)
 martinpapa69: I always use std stuff, when there is one for my problem
 martinpapa69: its better to have a clean code than to gain 5% performance
 martinpapa69: imo
 Wontonimo: if your clean code means 5 fewer bugs, absolutely 
 AllYourTrees: even if you pointed things properly your backprop would have to be a BFS instead of a single line
 AllYourTrees: cause now there are multiple parents
 AllYourTrees: ^ re transposition
 AllYourTrees: but i feel like bfs would be expensive
 martinpapa69: i dont have pointer to parants
 Wontonimo: the transposition is really for the benefit of that one branch and balancing it with the UCB calc
 martinpapa69: and i dont have a separate backprop function
 martinpapa69: if "backprop" with the return value of the recursive playout function
 Wontonimo: i don't think it would be bad to only backprop the path taken and skip all related parents
 michaellan: oh i completely forgot about backprop wrt transposition
 martinpapa69: ye i dont think so
 MSmits: AllYourTrees, about BFS, this is not really doable
 Wontonimo: if you wanted to use the sum of the child visits instead of the parent visits, that would "correct" your UCB calculation
 MSmits: Wontonimo even that is incorrect
 Wontonimo: do tell
 MSmits: well, I am thinking. I considered this before and dismissed it. trying to think of why
 MSmits: if you keep a visitcount on every node
 MSmits: but the real visitcount is the sum of child visits
 MSmits: which is it then?
 MSmits: the children also have children
 MSmits: do i use their visit count, or the sum of the granchildren
 michaellan: :mindblown:
 MSmits: a child may have a grandchild that has been updated, but it's not reflected in the visitcount of the child
 michaellan: what about some sort of lazy propagation
 Wontonimo: -inception-&#160;! i accept that it isn't "pure", but I attest that it is practical and  
 michaellan: where you have a flag that tells is it up-to-date
 Wontonimo: keeps true to the spirit of UCB
 MSmits: yeah, it's probably a first order correction that works Wontonimo
 MSmits: but i generally just ignore the issue
 MSmits: and accept the massive bias :P
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: oware has loops
 MSmits: think of the vicious circle of visit corrections you could get&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: ye you need to hash turn too
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: btw, my local meta mcts for oware hasnt found a single loop yet, with selection branches going 40 deep
 MSmits: 14 million selections so far
 MSmits: i have it set that when it encounters the same state twice during selection, it backprops 0
 MSmits: because in that case, both players agreed on a draw, sort of
 MSmits: a seed-draw that is. No more seeds captured after this point
 MSmits: (there may have been captures before)
 MSmits: but i cant debug it, because it doesnt happen =/
 martinpapa69: in meta mcts yo ujust precalculate the ucb tree locally and hardcode it&#160;?
 MSmits: hmm not entirely
 MSmits: my nodes are all in a dictionary
 MSmits: a massive one thats persistent (memory mapped)
 MSmits: the state hashes to the right node
 MSmits: so when i select, i generate all children and find them in the dictionary
 MSmits: then select one and do it again
 martinpapa69: ahh okay
 MSmits: transpositions are automatically handled this way
 MSmits: but yeah i suffer from the backprop and selection bias
 martinpapa69: that would definitely improve my nn bot
 MSmits: how do you mean
 martinpapa69: some precalculation of the nodes locally
 AllYourTrees: i wonder if you could pay for expensive transposition tables/bfs backprop while training the NN, and then on CG just do normal uct
 MSmits: do you mean an opening book?
 martinpapa69: ye something like that
 MSmits: thats what i am using it for
 MSmits: and maybe for training later
 MSmits: not sure yet
 MSmits: the 48-37 seed region will never be exact. The mcts value is an estimate
 AllYourTrees: martin what game are you working on
 martinpapa69: oware
 martinpapa69: but im basically working on my alpha zero framework not the game itself
 AllYourTrees: :thumbs_up:
 martinpapa69: MSmits btw. what if your book says that one note is a +4 for player 0
 martinpapa69: but player 1 have 23 score
 martinpapa69: and the node results in a series with 1 seed for player 1
 martinpapa69: then 5 seed for player 0
 martinpapa69: so i say its not enough to know the endresult of a node, you need to know every seedgain
 TawerLeon: hi there
 MSmits: back, let me think martinpapa69
 MSmits: I think it's a misconception that the game ending at 24 (or 25) seeds makes a difference
 MSmits: the only reason the game ends is that the other player cant win anymore
 MSmits: so you migth as well keep playing
 MSmits: it doesnt matter
 MSmits: so if it doesn't matter, why should I bother taking the issue into account?
 MSmits: maybe i misunderstood your question/comment though
 martinpapa69: (i thought game ends at 24 seed)
 MSmits: well if you have 24, you can still draw
 MSmits: or win
 martinpapa69: so if player 0 have 23 seeds
 MSmits: there are 48 seeds
 martinpapa69: and seeds a +2 node
 martinpapa69: sees*
 MSmits: then he won
 martinpapa69: ye, true. player1 cant get any seeds in that case
 MSmits: but the move that has the biggest net seed gain at the end of the game is always the best move in my way of looking at it
 MSmits: no matter what the current score is
 MSmits: ofc when you have 23 points, you can take a quick 2 points and win the game
 MSmits: or play longer and win the game by a larger margin
 MSmits: but you're not going to lose by picking the move with a greater net gain
 MSmits: thats impossible
 martinpapa69: ye, you are right
 MSmits: so this way i can ignore score and have a simpler gamestate for the NN. Might not help at all, but i like not having score as input
 martinpapa69: maybe i can integrate this thing into my AZ. hmhm
 MSmits: I have no idea if that's easy to do
 martinpapa69: can i actually just drop the score input&#160;??
 MSmits: I am training my nn to output something thats easily converted to a net score, so i can add it to the current score
 MSmits: well i am not there yet, but this is the plan
 MSmits: so my values are not estimates of win chance
 MSmits: but estimates of net score gain
 MSmits: no idea how this goes together with a policy and such
 martinpapa69: ye
 MSmits: I am a big fan of using as much domain knowledge as possible and focusing the NN to just the thing that is hard to figure out for humans
 MSmits: taking the score out fits with that idea
 MSmits: azero is supposed to be generating its own domain knowledge
 MSmits: so maybe not do that&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: I always belived in giving NN the as raw input as it makes sense
 martinpapa69: and let it do the job
 MSmits: there is something to that
 MSmits: but remember the xor example
 MSmits: what if you can replace the entire NN with a single ^operation
 MSmits: no need to do things needlessly
 MSmits: there is irony in that last line btw
 martinpapa69: ye sometimes it makes sense to transform the data
 GeorgeDzigo: cout &lt;&lt; "Hello how are y'all doing" &lt;&lt; endl;
 MSmits: hi GeorgeDzigo
 GeorgeDzigo: sup
 GeorgeDzigo: how are you?
 jacek: how may we help you, Sir/Madam
 MSmits: i'm fine GeorgeDzigo. Just chillin'
 AllYourTrees: i like making input as small as possible for NN. they can fit anything so may as well save computation
 MSmits: recur se said he makes small networks
 MSmits: but that migth not refer to input
 MSmits: maybe just few layers/nodes
 michaellan: since I'm using a global selected/path array, should I have my rollout return from the perspective of the root player?
 michaellan: i'm currently returning from the perspective of the node's player
 michaellan: i thikn the answer is yes but i am not 100% sure
 AllYourTrees: i think either way works, just changes where you place your negative signs
 michaellan: thank
 michaellan: what do you use?
 jacek: depends on selection
 AllYourTrees: perspective of current node
 MSmits: xxd yeah, unfortunately i do this in all possible ways across my different bots
 MSmits: when i do a random sim, some of my bots return 1 if the current player wins and some return 1 if the root player wins
 michaellan: so many possibilities for off-by-one-player erros
 jacek: if white wins in rollouts, add score to white's nodes and minus score to black's nodes
 AllYourTrees: jace what do you mean?
 michaellan: lol
 AllYourTrees: ahhh
 michaellan: yeah but i iterate from root downwards now
 michaellan: so i thought that might be eaiser
 MSmits: i do something silly
 MSmits: i let the input format decide for me
 MSmits: some games give you a player id
 jacek: AllYourTrees well you can have score in node from its perspective or global perspective. you just need to adjust the selectio then
 AllYourTrees: ahhhh i see
 MSmits: and in some games you're always player 1 from your own perspective
 michaellan: ok never shoulda asked now im 10x confused
 AllYourTrees: lol
 MSmits: you're supposed to be, this is literally the hardest part of mcts
 MSmits: the sign errors
 michaellan: i do think root is just easier in general though
 MSmits: figuring out if something needs a - or not
 AllYourTrees: i find node value relative to node's player the easiest to remember
 MSmits: yeah but does the root value need a - or not? when flipping signs in backprop, do you do it at the beginning of the loop, or at the end?
 AllYourTrees: then in selection, use -child value, and for rollout make score relative to current node
 MSmits: so many places to flip signs
 michaellan:&#160;; -&#160;;
 jacek: i dont have 'root' node, just list of children at the top hmm
 michaellan: MSmits: do you think of the "player" at each node as the player who just moved, or the player who is about to move?
 MSmits: who is about to move
 michaellan: goddamnit
 MSmits: so my root node belongs to the opponent
 MSmits: and the first child is my move
 michaellan: the other ppl i asked do it the other way
 MSmits: this is not the only way to do it
 AllYourTrees: isn't that the other way?
 martinpapa69: the "official" way is to backprop fro mthe prespective of the leaf node.In official i mean, it is used in  papers and popular implementations on github
 MSmits: there are many ways to do this
 MSmits: just be consistent with yourselrf
 AllYourTrees: ^
 michaellan: yeah but i was just wondering if one way is easier 
 AllYourTrees: do whatever makes sense and what works lol
 michaellan: none if it makes sense
 michaellan: of
 michaellan: i'm just trusting my gut now
 MSmits: it makes sense once you found one way and used it a lot
 MSmits: i wasted a lot of time, rewriting bots and doing it a little differently each time
 MSmits: confusing myself
 martinpapa69: i like it when i calculate the ucb scores i dont have to *-1
 MSmits: darkhorse made a template for mcts he uses across all his games
 michaellan: smart
 michaellan: i wanted to do that but i got lazy and started coupling game logic and MCTS logic
 MSmits: martinpapa69 yeah i dont do *-1
 MSmits: and if i had to, i'd just take the minimum instead of the maximum
 michaellan: why do you need *-1?
 martinpapa69: because you messed up the signs
 MSmits: if you backpropagated everything wrong :P
 michaellan: breh
 AllYourTrees: if node's score is for itself, then best child is -1 * child value
 AllYourTrees: if node's score is for parent, then best child is child value
 martinpapa69: the node's score is from the parents perspective
 MSmits: xxd nothing we say about this is gonna make it more clear. You need to draw pictures on paper and such&#160;:)
 MSmits: also, I am ashamed to admit i sometimes just coded a thing, flipped a couple of signs in various ways until it got  into the top 10 :P
 michaellan: ah i see what you guys mean now, but i will have to think about it more to actually udnerstand it
 michaellan: urgh
 martinpapa69: but ye i spent hours, if not days to just change signs everywhere and to hope it works
 MSmits: haha thats what i just said 
 AllYourTrees: its a rite of passage
 MSmits: it helps to minimize the number of signs required
 MSmits: if you see somewhere you're doubling up on signs, eliminate both of them
 michaellan: :bigbrain:
 jacek: MSmits this is what i do with inputs. sometimes board is flipped and/or mirrored vs my representation, so i brute force changes until it works
 MSmits: ohh yeah boardflipping makes everything worse&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: oh ya true lol
 MSmits: also using solver does too
 MSmits: more signs
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 Astrobytes: it really is a minefield of sign errors, or a signfield of mine errors...
 MSmits: my professors at the uni told me the biggest difference between math and physics is that the signs are really important in physics wheras in math they are... meh
 MSmits: is true for coding as well&#160;:)
 RightHandElf: why is my chat scrolling itself
 MSmits: no idea, it happens to me as well
 Astrobytes: it's extremely annoying
 MSmits: well the auto scrolling is not as bad as the fact that it locks everything up
 MSmits: you cant do anything
 MSmits: until its done
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that too
 martinpapa69: it only happens to me when i have multiple cg tabs open
 Astrobytes: There are not many days when that is not the case for me lol
 RightHandElf: I only had the one open but I did leave it up overnight and I might've had another open when I opened this one
 Astrobytes: if you leave the chat minimised I think it's OK, even with multiple tabs
 Astrobytes: iirc
 martinpapa69: there were crazy memory leaks on abandoned cg tabs back then
 martinpapa69: like one cg tab consumed 10's of gigabytes
 Astrobytes: Certain games if I remember rightly
 AllYourTrees: so any tricks to speed up NN computations? i tried simd but it was slower :scream:
 jacek: get faster cpu
 AllYourTrees: on CG i mean
 AllYourTrees: has anyone tried batching multiple node evaluations?
 jacek: sponsor faster servers for CG
 AllYourTrees: LOL
 jacek: have you tried nncache
 AllYourTrees: whats that
 AllYourTrees: just a cache for computations?
 RoboStac: have you tried a less rusty language?&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: how dare you
 jacek: like transposition table, but you put state - nn eval
 jacek: depends on how transposity is the game it may speed up considerably
 AllYourTrees: this is C4
 AllYourTrees: so probably a lot?
 jacek: so, quite
 AllYourTrees: kk wish me luck
 jacek: are you doing policy as well
 RoboStac: yeah, nncache is very good on c4
 AllYourTrees: ya policy &amp; value
 jacek: everyone doing policy but me&#160;:(
 AllYourTrees: :shrug: we are just about even now that royale blew up the ranks
 michaellan: whats policy
 AllYourTrees: a distribution over children nodes
 AllYourTrees: theoretically allows mcts to focus in certain parts of the tree
 michaellan: interesting
 michaellan: Do i need to worry about this? warning: comparing floating-point with '==' or '!=' is unsafe [-Wfloat-equal]
 michaellan: if (n-&gt;visits == 0)
 brooklyn76: Hi umm what do we do on here im new and just joined??
 RoboStac: probably not for a visit count, you aren't doing anything that could cause decimal places (it's only an issue if you are hitting accuracy limits which you won't do with full numbers until about 16 million)
 michaellan: I see
 michaellan: thanks robo
 michaellan: i guess i can make it &lt; 1
 MSmits: policy predates nn's i think
 MSmits: there are mcts enhancements that use something like a policy
 MSmits: explore high valued children sooner
 MSmits: (this assumes you have mcts with eval)
 MACKEYTH: I read a paper recently that suggested eval functions are best employed to terminate rollouts early, with each rollout still judged as a win or loss
 Astrobytes: EPT, yes. Early playout termination
 MACKEYTH: Once you start giving children values other than win/loss, doesn't that throw off the exploration constant in the UCT function?
 RoboStac: only if the values are outside the range
 RoboStac: it's normal for a node value in uct to be between -1/1 as it's averaged over all visits
 reCurse: You just need to scale the constant accordingly
 reCurse: There's nothing special about the range
 Astrobytes: You can either adjust your exploration constant or scale your eval score
 MSmits: it's funny to assign 117 as a loss, 118 as a draw and 119 as a win value
 MSmits: you can use the same exploration param for that
 MSmits: and your bot plays the same way
 MSmits: because an additive constant changes nothing, the addition being 118 here
 reCurse: Well
 reCurse: Guess I'm going to be that guy
 reCurse: You lose a lot more precision at 117
 MSmits: hmm sure i guess so, mathematically it's the same, but yeah 32 bit floats and all that
 michaellan: MSmits: 
 michaellan: the FastRand function is defined on ints
 MSmits: oh yeah, it's only for integers
 michaellan: but in even the first iteration
 michaellan: mcts_c4.cpp:20:50: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 777778 * 214013 cannot be represented in type 'int'
 michaellan: is it *meant* to overflow?
 michaellan: I have a flag that crashes my program on these erros
 MSmits: probably yeah
 michaellan: ok
 MSmits: I did not design it
 michaellan: aight aight
 MSmits: i just use it
 MSmits: funny that it tells you this
 RoboStac: it probably shouldn't be signed though
 MSmits: i must be having my VS setup poorly, i never saw any errors
 RoboStac: whats the function?
 MSmits: inline int FastRand(int mod) { g_seed = (214013 * g_seed + 2531011); return (((g_seed &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0x7FFF) * mod) &gt;&gt; 15; }
 michaellan: unsigned integer is UB
 michaellan: unsigned integer overflwo*
 RoboStac: no, unsigned is ok, signed is bad
 MSmits: you mean the seed?
 michaellan: oh, i swore i saw the opposite somewhere
 michaellan: yeah you're right
 michaellan: inside the function, where there's 214013 * g_seed
 MSmits: yeah?
 michaellan: that sub-expression is larger than signed integer max size
 MSmits: ok
 RoboStac: probably all 3 (seed, mod, return value) should be unsigned
 MSmits: ah, i just took it off stack overflow at some point I think
 MSmits: it works, but maybe it could work better
 MSmits: are you sure the overflow is not a feature?
 michaellan: i thikn its meant to be
 michaellan: but i'm too dumb
 michaellan: so i'm gonna not use it for now
 MSmits: ah, i sometimes use stuff i dont know how it works
 MSmits: like fast sqrt and such
 MSmits: i do check it to see if it does what it's supposed to
 michaellan: omg
 michaellan: wait MSmits 
 michaellan: you said 3 and 5 are best, and 1 and 7 are most equal?
 michaellan: and 4 is second best
 MSmits: yes
 michaellan: i think im getting there!
 michaellan: close to coding up the basic part of it
 MSmits: most good mcts bots will find 3 or 5 as best move on turn 1
 MSmits: you dont need a local meta mcts with millions of games simmed, to find this
 michaellan: whats the best second move/reply to 3/5
 MSmits: in terms of winrate on meta mcts, i it's more or less 40% - 50% - 60% - 70% -60%  for the first 5 moves from left to right
 MSmits: the other 4 are symmetric
 michaellan: mhm
 MSmits: reply hmm
 MSmits: the best reply is to steal it :P
 MSmits: i cant get to my meta mcts program atm. It's big and i transfered it to my slow HD
 MSmits: running oware now
 MSmits: but whatever the reply is, it's a losing move
 michaellan: okay
 MSmits: i can tell you all the best moves for oware any time you want though :0
 michaellan: ._.
 andyescobar: anyone knows why I keep getting an unalitialized numb6 variable 
 andyescobar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf8868bb-76f5-4e33-aa29-125845728577">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cf8868bb-76f5-4e33-aa29-125845728577</a>
 MSmits: int numb6,
 MSmits: it has no value
 MSmits: int numb6 = 0 works
 MSmits: you are assuming they are both set to 0 on that line of code
 MSmits: but they aren't
 andyescobar: MSmith I added a value to numb6 along with numb8
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: it's uninitialized
 MSmits: you just set numb8 to 0
 Astrobytes: donno if that works in java
 andyescobar: int num6, numb8 = 0;
 Astrobytes: What MSmits said
 MSmits: the error tells me it doesn;t work 
 andyescobar: ohh thanks
 MSmits: so i dont need to know about java
 MSmits: not much else can be wrong
 andyescobar: yeah thanks
 MSmits: it can only be uninitialized if it was never initialized
 Astrobytes: No shit!
 andyescobar: I am transitioning from C++ to java
 MSmits: :poop: 
 andyescobar: and its killing me not really but some syntax is a bit different
 MSmits: cool, yeah c++ lets you do lots of stuff that's a bad idea :0
 Astrobytes: It's a completely different 'experience'
 andyescobar: Yeah thanks a lot btw
 michaellan: why dont they put PIE rule in UTTT
 michaellan: oops idk why i capitalized pie
 MSmits: they just didn't when it was created
 MSmits: pie rule was first used in Yacalath
 michaellan: they can add a patch
 MSmits: c-&gt;v
 michaellan: or not
 MSmits: it would be too damaging to the bots already submitted
 Astrobytes: I kinda like Yacalath. When struct comes back you can suggest that to him.
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: pie rule would definitely fix the imbalance in uttt, but would add some more complexity. If you just view uttt as a new player mcts practice tool, then it's not worth it
 MSmits: near the top the imbalance really hurts the game
 michaellan: true
 michaellan: when i run out of space do i just ditch everything and restart?
 MSmits: when two bots are clearly not near in strength, the imbalance doesnt matter
 MSmits: node pool?
 michaellan: yeah
 michaellan: i dont think it'll matter in the real thing
 MSmits: i have a buffer. If I get near 90% of the node pool being used, I drop the tree. This is very easy as you just set the first node as the root and treat the root as not expanded
 michaellan: nice
 MSmits: whatever old data is still in the tree is just as ignored as if it were uninitialize
 MSmits: d
 MSmits: there is a riskier thing you can do
 MSmits: you can also keep the whole tree but just set the index back to 0
 MSmits: and hope none of the overwritten nodes are still being used
 MSmits: in uttt this is safe to do
 Astrobytes: it can go very badly wrong though
 MSmits: yeah, the more performant your bot, the more likely it does
 MSmits: there are many games where i dont even use 10M nodes, let alone 25
 MSmits: but some are really cheap to sim
 michaellan: the method described in the github markdown page earlier to determine winner doesnt seem to work
 michaellan: it made sense in my head
 MSmits: sorry i dont use that method
 michaellan: i used a method that trys to check for ALL verticalss at once
 michaellan: and ALL horizontals
 michaellan: but like it can wrap around incorrectly
 michaellan: i think
 MSmits: yeah those are complicated things
 MSmits: the main thing is to keep everything as simple as possible. Dont worry about optimizing 
 michaellan: do you loop?
 MSmits: do that later
 MSmits: i dont wincheck
 xxd: wtf
 MSmits: i calculate all winning moves for the opponent
 MSmits: then make sure i dont play under them
 MSmits: if no such moves exist
 MSmits: i lose
 Astrobytes: Wrap around as in bitboards? Just mask the areas you don't wanna go out of bounds from
 MSmits: i never win
 MSmits: (in the sim)
 xxd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/454da757-c377-4731-bb8a-3d02dfa9a2ab">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/454da757-c377-4731-bb8a-3d02dfa9a2ab</a>
 xxd: this is probably very very buggy
 xxd: because of the wrapping around
 xxd: oh wait theres a typo in there
 xxd: too
 MSmits: yeah wrapping is annoying
 michaellan: i underestimated C4
 MSmits: c4 is harder than uttt sim-wise
 Wontonimo: really?
 MSmits: but not terribly hard compared to some games
 Wontonimo: i found c4 way easier
 MSmits: well maybe it's harder because of simd being usable
 Wontonimo: but then again, i had a lot of practice before c4 and little practice before uttt
 Wontonimo: okay, you are 2nd and i'm 19th
 Wontonimo: so, yeah, it's easier if I don't rank as high lol
 Wontonimo: true skill difference is 46.24 (u) vs 32.62 (me)
 michaellan: I havent been able to complete anything for a couple days now, im sad
 Wontonimo: where as for uttt 29.89 (u) vs 24.54 (me) I still sometimes win against you when I play first
 reCurse: Relying on CG scoring is a fatal mistake
 reCurse: Unfortunately they killed benching so competitiveness on CG may now also be a fatal mistake&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: reCurse: come now, it's all about 'fun' and happyhappy joyjoy, not competitiveness :P
 <b>**Wontonimo wonto checks pulse</b></p><p><img src="/a/58850847098890" /> reCurse: Killing benching was the last straw for me
 reCurse: I don't care anymore :P
 reCurse: Just mentioning
 reCurse: Delta score is bad
 Astrobytes: Absolutely mind-bendingly peculiar decision
 Astrobytes: (CG I mean)
 michaellan: is benching sitting out or something?
 Astrobytes: CGBench, you could benchmark against other bots in the leaderboard by connecting via the 'CG API' and running IDE matches to gather stats
 xxd: oh bench as in benchmarking
 xxd: i mean i can see why they removed that
 xxd: when did they remove it?
 Astrobytes: Have you tried tweaking parameters in the IDE and doing a few plays? (not even submits)
 xxd: yeah it takes long time
 Astrobytes: You reach the play limit *very* quickly.
 xxd: oh theres a limit
 Astrobytes: The only solution is offline self-play, or replay downloads (which is also, I presume, heavily affected by this)
 CaptainDrewBoy: Hi everyone! New to CodinGame
 Astrobytes: But yeah, I'm chill on the situation. It's sad but life goes on.
 Wontonimo: hey CaptainDrewBoy&#160;! Nice pic
 Astrobytes: Hippie too, I dig.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, night all
 Astrobytes: afternoon, whatever
 michaellan: gn
 korex: hello
 peppers: hi  everyone
 MSmits: Wontonimo it surprises me not at all you sometimes beat me as p1, even with 5 rating difference
 MSmits: c4 is different because it's balanced
 MSmits: sorry for late reply, gonna get some sleep now&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: gn
 Wontonimo: hi peppers
 peppers: :smiley:+
 ja_fica: C4 is one of the best games to try simulation AI's
 ja_fica: For me is the best option to learn from bitboard to minmax to montecarlo tree search
 ja_fica: also AVX instructions work well in gere
 ja_fica: *here
 xxd: i think the is_win function is harder for C4 than for UTTT
 xxd: granted, someone generously spoonfed me the "fast" way to check is_win for UTTT
 michaellan: ja_fica: where do you use AVX? for checking win?
 michaellan: I'm trying to use the num_selected value (how many nodes in the current path) to determine who the current player is but its definitely not working...
 michaellan: need to think this thorugh
 xxd: i hate how i went from "decent-ish" code to global-variables-everywhere 
 xxd: so hard to reason with
 ProCoder03: in UTTT bronze if the board to play as per last move is already captured, when can we play in random boards&#160;???
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's when
 ProCoder03: interesting, i just need to fix it&#160;!!!
 grindy: Im back 
 grindy: :grinning:
 michaellan: i feel like if you didnt account for that in the beginning, there may be a chance you will have to make some annoying changes to your code
 michaellan: like bitset/int sizing etc
 kresteodymium: asdasad is cool
 ProCoder03: @xxd is it for me&#160;???
 kresteodymium: everyone go follow him, he's really good :D
 asdasasd: kresteodymium won IOI
 michaellan: lmao are yall 9yo
 peppers: ÏïàÎÖï
 kresteodymium: xxd is orz
 asdasasd: hello krish wants ioi medal
 kresteodymium: thats what jinha wants
 asdasasd: segment tree
 kresteodymium: orz
 xxd: shut up cringe USACO people
 asdasasd: heavy decomposition
 kresteodymium: lol
 asdasasd: eulerian circuits
 xxd: heavy light decomp
 xxd: blah blah blah some more algos no one cares about
 xxd: using ll = long long;
 kresteodymium: lol
 kresteodymium: macros are good doe
 asdasasd: lol 
 asdasasd: did anyone ask
 asdasasd: kresteodymium
 kresteodymium: bruh
 kresteodymium: hmmm
 xxd: u guys on the usaco discord?
 asdasasd: convex hull 
 asdasasd: is so cute
 asdasasd: functional graphs UwU
 xxd: CHT or convex hull
 xxd: CHT is cute
 asdasasd: latter definitely
 asdasasd: imho 
 xxd: i wrote a li chao tree once for a CF problem, still timed out, and i didnt bother again
 xxd: i also stole the li chao tree part from eric zhang's library repo
 asdasasd: oh nice 
 xxd: so i guess im just dogwater
 kresteodymium: so youre USACO too i suppose
 asdasasd: have you tried network flow probs 
 asdasasd: max
 kresteodymium: orz
 xxd: nah
 kresteodymium: imagine being camper
 xxd: i dont really do usaco much anymore
 xxd: never that good
 asdasasd: camperr brrrr
 kresteodymium: asdasasd is camper
 xxd: proof?
 kresteodymium: bruh
 kresteodymium: fricking ioi
 xxd: aight cap
 kresteodymium: chad
 asdasasd: kresteodymium stop 
 kresteodymium: lol
 kresteodymium: ioi chad
 asdasasd: seriously
 xxd: what are you guys working on, if anything
 asdasasd: lagrangian relaxation cute
 kresteodymium: lol
 kresteodymium: i tried eulerian tour stuff on a dmoj problem
 kresteodymium: but it died to mle
 kresteodymium: sadge
 asdasasd: when ur main programming language is javascript
 kresteodymium: bruh
 kresteodymium: imagine being python and going to usaco camp
 kresteodymium: *python user
 asdasasd: xxd
 asdasasd: hi
 xxd: sorry cant hear you over the sound of my bugs
 kresteodymium: hi

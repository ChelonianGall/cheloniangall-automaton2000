 lord8266: is there a source size limit to ocean of code?
 struct: 100k chars
 lord8266: ok peace
 lord8266: and is the response time same for all languages, im already hitting ~7ms on python for almost nothing
 struct: same time for all languages yes
 lord8266: damn thats bad
 struct: Do you start the timer after reading first input?
 lord8266: yeah after every update, i made my own environment in python and stuff..
 lord8266: sorry for being stupid, how do you run this locally
 Nixerrr: Depends what you want to do lord8266
 Nixerrr: You can clone the repo and run it locally. Here is the SDK's documentation: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction</a>
 Nixerrr: Or you could recreate the simulation from scratch
 lord8266: thank you
 dbdr: Nixerrr thanks for taking the early shift!&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: yes i don't see how the documentation helps to just run it
 eulerscheZahl: i answered him on discord, where he asked the same
 eulerscheZahl: by linking to that question on the forum
 Nixerrr: tbf I haven't checked if the documentation gives instructions to running it. Just assumed it did
 Nixerrr: It was a false assumption it seems
 eulerscheZahl: you deserve a not helpful answer for asking the same questions at different places
 FlyingMoustache_e541: hi
 FlyingMoustache_e541: can you help me 
 Nixerrr: Depends
 Nixerrr: If you want money, no
 Nixerrr: If you need coding advice, maybe
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you can help memy opponent tracking needs improvement
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for your offer
 Nixerrr: :P
 lord8266: im sorry, im really new around here
 eulerscheZahl: check discord, i linked a helping answer there
 eulerscheZahl: but it's not trivial if you don't know java and maven
 lord8266: ok so I ran mvn clean install and it installed dependencies 
 lord8266: then how do you run main.java
 lord8266: im on ubuntu 18.04
 lord8266: running it with java src/test/java/Main.java throws some compilation error
 eulerscheZahl: i never tried from command line, i always used eclipse or intelliJ
 lord8266: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea756345-9719-4ccb-a949-c80730967ff9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea756345-9719-4ccb-a949-c80730967ff9</a>
 yfprojects: Where do you run mvn on Windows?
 yfprojects: @eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: import somehow failed
 Nixerrr: Looks like some dependency issue
 eulerscheZahl: don't ask me windows questions, i'm on linux myself
 Nixerrr: lord8266 Why do you want to run it locally btw?
 lord8266: java --versionopenjdk 11.0.6 2020-01-14OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.6+10-post-Ubuntu-1ubuntu118.04.1)OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.6+10-post-Ubuntu-1ubuntu118.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
 lord8266: I thought I could use little grid search for parameters to see where the opponent will be using given directions
 Uljahn: good question Nixerrr
 eulerscheZahl: not a java problem, you somehow failed to import the codingame SDK from maven
 Tiramon: so classpath is not set properly
 Nixerrr: lord8266 I don't think you need to run the game locally to add enemy detection to your bot
 lord8266: so i have for each tile a surrounding value which tells how many islands or corners are obstructing it 
 lord8266: not obstrucing, i meant like around it
 lord8266: so then given enemy moves i can place those moves on top of each square assuming the player was there
 Nixerrr: One thing you could do is keep track of the cells the enemy could occupy and keep reducing that list of cells
 Nixerrr: 1st round - it's every cell that isn't an island
 Nixerrr: Then enemy moves north
 lord8266: exactly im doing something like that
 Nixerrr: Okie
 Nixerrr: Also, you'll hit computational boundaries sooner with Python than with other languages
 lord8266: so just find the right values for surrounding if it is an island or corner to see why the player turned and grid search for which values (like 0.5,1,2..) i can find at the earliest which sector the opponent is in
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/uXHgaVh">https://imgur.com/a/uXHgaVh</a>you don't need a local copy of the referee for this
 dbdr: pub const INITIAL_COOLDOWN: u8 = 3;
 dbdr: what was I thinking?
 eulerscheZahl: saving bits by using u8 i guess
 dbdr: yes. the issue is there is no such constant
 dbdr: it depends on the power
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's a combined const for all of them...
 eulerscheZahl: you wrote that in wood2 maybebefore knowing about the rest
 dbdr: yes, must be it
 dbdr: pub const POWERS: [Charge; POWERS_COUNT] = [Mine, Silence, Sonar, Torpedo];pub const INITIAL_COOLDOWN: [u8; POWERS_COUNT] = [3, 6, 4, 3];
 dbdr: better
 sudomakeinstall2: how to know if i got a timeout?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean for all games of your last submit combined?
 eulerscheZahl: or a single game?
 sudomakeinstall2: no just the on i am testing in ide
 eulerscheZahl: what does it say at the last frame?
 Uljahn: Nixerrr: this game is very numpy friendly btw
 sudomakeinstall2: -1 life
 eulerscheZahl: there are red and orange rectangles on the progress bar below the replay
 eulerscheZahl: hover over the last one
 sudomakeinstall2: oh yeah i saw it
 sudomakeinstall2: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and check the output area below the replay for error messages
 eulerscheZahl: you might see a line number where it crashed
 sudomakeinstall2: thanks it was the timeout.
 Nixerrr: Uljahn Good to know
 dbdr: it's a bit painful to submit when I'm #6 :D
 AntiSquid: ^ just remember there's a full month ahead and things change a lot :p
 dbdr: sure, it's not rational&#160;:)
 dbdr: there, I as brave
 dbdr: *was
 AntiSquid: #4
 AntiSquid: are you learning rust or are you using it daily?
 dbdr: with 20% timeouts
 dbdr: I don't use it for my job
 dbdr: only for CG and hobby programming
 AntiSquid: why rust over c++&#160;?
 dbdr: much cleaner
 dbdr: no segfaults
 dbdr: same perf
 dbdr: oOo
 egaetan: Hello dbdr oOO
 dbdr: you still beat me 2-0 so far&#160;:)
 egaetan: 2/0 is not significant enough
 dbdr: I know
 thibpat: hi all, I'm going to stream my Ocean of Code progress on twitch.tv/thibpat, feel free to come say hello :wave:
 thibpat: Sorry I mean <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 dbdr: cool. did you announce on #streaming on discord thibpat?
 egaetan: Aaah my lost game vs dbdr is a timeout&#160;:(
 thibpat: I didn't dbdr, good point!
 egaetan: dont feed mchi12
 dbdr: is it a silly timeout egaetan?
 dbdr: or too many paths?
 dbdr: ok
 dbdr: :D
 egaetan: a silly first turn, class loading from java
 dbdr: ah
 dbdr: good for you, should be fixable no?
 egaetan: if i only know what exactly...
 dbdr: what's your output?
 dbdr: real victory this time&#160;:)
 egaetan: nothing... everything is fine, debug fine too, except timeout fro mplateforem
 egaetan: gg dbdr
 dbdr: merci!
 dbdr: nothing on stderr?
 egaetan: nothing
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 dbdr: I seem firmly in top 3 now, big gap with #4
 dbdr: egaetan do you have a print early on that does not show?
 dbdr: oh I think I know. it might very well be the issue I talked about on the forum
 egaetan: dbdr i hate you
 dbdr: will you love me if I fix your timeouts?&#160;;)
 egaetan: Ahh maybe
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: only turn 1 is 1s
 dbdr: you need to exercise your main code
 dbdr: to load the classes and start the JIT
 dbdr: otherwise they will load on turn 2, when you only have 50ms
 egaetan: ok so far i did that, i should have miss one
 egaetan: i did warmup streams and optionals
 dbdr: maybe run them several times
 dbdr: the JIT does not quick in if a method is called only once
 egaetan: it more a class loading issue that a jit i think
 dbdr: ouch, streams are hard for performance
 dbdr: and a lot of classes to load...
 egaetan: yes, but easy to write
 dbdr: I had such issues when I used Java
 dbdr: my solution was to avoid streams
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: I use them in rust, zero cost abstraction and all
 MadKnight: a better solution was to avoid java
 dbdr: I'm sure they get reasonably fast in Java, but startup is a killer
 AntiSquid: new #1
 mchl12: yeah, thanks for feeding guys
 dbdr: np :D
 AntiSquid: lol
 mchl12: &lt;3
 dbdr: within the margin of error though
 dbdr: egaetan will wreck us when he fixes his timeouts
 dbdr:     self.enemy.retain(|e| sector(e.pos) == surface_sector);
 dbdr: it's quick nice way to filter a vector
 MadKnight: dbdr discovers filter function
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Nixerrr: Looks succinct
 dbdr: and fast at the same time
 dbdr: that's the great part
 egaetan: gg mchl12
 dbdr: well, only in release more. without optimizations it must be horrible
 dbdr: egaetan by the way, there are ways to monitor which classes load
 dbdr: but that might not help, you already know the problem I think
 dbdr: wait, you timeout on turn 2 right?
 egaetan: the first turn @ 50ms
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: that  means classes were loaded, if you warmed up correctly
 dbdr: so it might be the JIT
 egaetan: i dont know, jit should not impact when i run in 1 ms
 dbdr: there are several passes of compilation
 dbdr: first few executions are interpreted, to collect stats
 dbdr: then a quick compilation
 dbdr: then if enough calls, recompiled with optimizations
 Nangini: dbdr rust is nice compact powerful but sometimes it can be tricky
 Nangini: with the ownership thing
 Nangini: when you have to use Box or Arc etc...
 dbdr: yes, you need to get used to it
 dbdr: I almost never do use those
 eulerscheZahl: ownerSHIP
 dbdr: you need to design your data model differently
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, couldn't resist
 dbdr: nice one eulerscheZahl
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: Nangini what other language do you use most?
 Nangini: that's why i finally gave up on rust
 Nangini: and use Go
 Nangini: i cant wrap my head properly around graph in rust
 dbdr: right, in Go you have a GC so you just let it do it work
 Nangini: but the experience of learning/using rust was really worthwhile
 Nangini: and an other thing at the time on CG rust was not in release mode
 dbdr: yes, many ppl say that, it's useful even for programming in other languages
 Nangini: so the perf were not up to what the language can really achieve&#160;:)
 dbdr: for graphs, the simple solution is to use a vector and to model links as indexes
 dbdr: it's a bit weird at first but easier I think
 dbdr: and it's also good for cache locality
 dbdr: better than references all over  the heap
 dbdr: so good for performance
 Nangini: i might give rust an other try but not on CG
 Nangini: perhaps looking at servo or sth...
 dbdr: sure. it would be nice if CG did at least -O1 in debug mode
 dbdr: I had a 40x slowdown the other day
 dbdr: between debug and release
 Nangini: of course!!
 Nangini: sometimes you can't run properly a code in the ide which will perform great in the arena...
 YannT: it climbed to #10 while sleeping
 dbdr: in that case, I replace a for .. by a while and got 30x speedup :D
 YannT: who's a goood submarine
 YannT: it's youuu
 Nangini: dbdr nice trick ;D
 dbdr: Nangini otherwise the workaound is to compile locally and to send the binary to CG
 dbdr: but a bit of a pain
 dbdr: need to get the binary small enough
 pb4: it's made easier with Agade's send tool
 pb4: but it's forbidden during contests
 pb4: also beware, in some cases I NEVER even approached the performance of code on CG + pragma with send-tool
 pb4: Notably on vindinium, I still don't understand why but I lost 75% performance
 MadKnight: it probably compiles for any cpu so it doesn't use fancy things or maybe it compiles for x86, pb4
 dbdr: pb4 I don't think it's forbidden in the IDE
 dbdr: you can submit the source
 YannT: it is, there's a no obfuscation rule 
 YannT: I think
 dbdr: sure, for what you submit
 dbdr: what does it matter what runs in the IDE?
 dbdr: it affects nobody else
 YannT: oh yeah for IDE probably no one cares&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: 2 weeks of bronze?
 Tunga: Newbie here, are you all here talking about bot contests? And what is the best performance language for bot, C++? How is python performance&#160;?
 735487: AntiSquid: 1 week as I see
 emh: I broke everything with big refactor.. now don't know where to begin
 AntiSquid: oh lol ... i somehow read it as 3rd of april, didn't wake up properly
 Uljahn: Tunga: python is worst unless you know how to vectorize with numpy
 AntiSquid: unless you're a cat with a cat avatar
 735487:  emh: start from rollback of backup&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: history tab yeah
 emh: I have git history as well... but hate going back
 Tunga: Uljahn Thanks!
 dbdr: emh&#160;:(
 dbdr: I know the feeling
 dbdr: small refectorings rule, but not always possible
 emh: dbdr thx for sympathy
 dbdr: when you do a big refactoring, it's ok to expect some debbugging afterwards, no?
 emh: yes but could have doner smaller steps
 emh: got too eager
 dbdr: yeah, live and learn
 dbdr: sometimes I has two implementations of the same thing, just to assert they find the same result
 dbdr: sometimes I was less clever
 dbdr: I mean keeping the old implementation until the new one is proven
 pb4: Can you trigger several mines in the same turn&#160;?
 dbdr: "you can use each type of action only once per turn"
 pb4: thanks
 accorp: how about with torpedo?&#160;:)
 YannT: when doing big refactors, I try to find any reproducible battle (in the IDE), and check that the frames are the same after refactor
 dbdr: that's a good idea
 egaetan: emh where are you&#160;?
 emh: egaetan down and broken
 emh: but at least I got my tea order today
 emh: gunpowder green tea
 emh: jasmine tea
 emh: christmas tea
 emh: licorice tea
 egaetan:&#160;:)
 egaetan: dbdr that's not nice
 dbdr: at least I don't feed mchl12 as much
 dbdr: but yeah, sorry
 YannT: you knocked me down 5 slots dbdr please never push again :p
 dbdr: sure thing :D
 dbdr: ending the contest right now would fulfill your request
 dbdr: I would not mind
 YannT: okay for me too, I'm in top20 so   I get the tshirt
 dbdr: I only beat you twice
 dbdr: pretty close TS scores
 YannT: we went 8-1 in my last battles
 dbdr: probably from my previous push then
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/ocean-of-code/YannT">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/ocean-of-code/YannT</a>
 dbdr: 24%
 AntiSquid: what sort of random magic are you using mchl12&#160;?
 emh: yay found a bug. but there are more
 dbdr: emh I love the licorice taste!
 dbdr: seems like you are set for the month tea-wise :D
 emh: dbdr me too. brewing first cup now. yes 500g or so hehe
 dbdr: clever in these times
 dbdr: what are you changing?
 emh: just "compressing" code
 emh: removing redundancies
 emh: and some small changes I run into
 emh: when I see it
 dbdr: oh, then indeed small steps would have been better
 dbdr: I thought you changed the approach
 emh: nah
 dbdr: still you will sort it out
 emh: hope so
 emh: and btw it's licorice chilli hehe
 emh: I put a lot of tea in it. it's black now hehe
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: mchl12 beats dbdrdbdr beats egaetanegaetan beats mchl12
 dbdr: hm
 egaetan: hum hum
 egaetan: if only mchl12 resubmit i will be #1 again&#160;?
 dbdr: possibly
 egaetan: and you will be third&#160;?
 dbdr: though sample is small, who knos...
 dbdr: knows
 egaetan: if i resubmit you will be first&#160;?
 dbdr: only one way to know for sure...&#160;;)
 dbdr: you have nothing to lose
 dbdr: Schnee is far
 egaetan: let's try
 dbdr: :popcorn:
 dbdr: you lose against bottom lb, probably timeouts
 dbdr: that must hurt
 egaetan: ouch in first 10 , 5 timeouts
 wlesavo: probably its the silence spamers
 egaetan: only loose are timeouts
 egaetan: wlesavo no, something weird with first turn
 emh: found another bug. more remains
 YannT: egaetan; maybe you should preload .split() too&#160;;)
 wlesavo: egaetan maybe its related to that 20ms discussion?
 emh: and another. looking better now
 dbdr: great
 egaetan: dbdr nothing to loose&#160;? hmmm&#160;!
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: looking better
 egaetan: only 3 timeouts in first 20
 egaetan: that's awfull
 YannT: how do you timeout anyway do you have a sim already?
 egaetan: no something with first turn @50ms
 dbdr: strange that kotlin does not have the issue
 YannT: I did have the issue
 dbdr: :phew:
 YannT: classloading on split on the first turn
 dbdr: lol
 YannT: first call of split cost 20ms for whatever classloading reason, so I put a junk one in the initial 1s thing to fix it
 YannT: fun main(args: Array&lt;String&gt;) {
 egaetan: dsl YannT i didn't timeout vs you
 YannT:&#160;:(
 YannT: maybe you could put a sleep in to maximize timeouts?
 dbdr: Illedan, would there be a way to see the last frame?
 dbdr: now it's hidden by the end screen
 egaetan: 27 timeouts on 93 game =&gt; #22
 Illedan: Yeah, I know. I will rewrite this code into actually doing 1 command at a time. And add an empty frame at the end
 Illedan: But it might be a few days
 Illedan: You know, life, my own bot and all that
 Illedan: And yeah, work
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: there is time&#160;:)
 YannT: top20 gets shuffled everytime someone in it pushes
 yfprojects: Is threading a thing in CG?
 Scarfield: only one core is available
 jrke: anyone of you can hack any website
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: can you hack google.com?
 Automaton2000: but i like the idea of a good one
 MSmits: holy :poop:  They just cancelled my exams
 Illedan: Damn, more time for OOC?
 MSmits: no, it's after OCC
 MSmits: OOC
 Illedan: Let your class know they are graded based on OOC?
 Illedan: :D
 MSmits: during the other planned contest
 MSmits: I mean my physics class btw, my CS class has no exams
 MSmits: so they will get their diploma based on tests they did in our school as opposed to national exams
 MSmits: it's really weird. Never happened before
 MSmits: what if they screwed up our tests? They normally would get a (long) shot at the national exams to compensate. That's now gone
 YannT: I'm sure they canceled CS exams during the dark plague too
 dbdr: yeah, priorities
 MSmits: it may cost some students a year of studying though
 MSmits: some might not be happy about this
 Scarfield: just have them do the exams from home, and tell them not to cheat
 MSmits: hah we can't even do that. 
 MSmits: minister of education decided they're cancelled so they're cancelled
 YannT: can't give some home assignement anbd then on the school level decide to give it a bigger coefficient than the other school tests
 YannT: that would be like an exam
 ThunderbirdOne: Cpt. Levine just torped himself... what a nerf
 MSmits: YannT, we can, but that would be slippery slope. Would lead to some obviously unqualified students to get their diploma
 egaetan: dbdr only 10 timeouts for 92 games
 ThunderbirdOne: give students online exams with access to internet... yeah... sounds like a good idea
 YannT: for CS you can give some assignement that is more practice than theoratical no?
 MSmits: it's physics, not CS
 YannT: one where having google doesn't matter
 YannT: ahhh
 YannT: yeah that's harder
 MSmits: also, it's not just, me it's all my colleagues as well. French, German, chemistry, biology etc.
 YannT: have them screw around witrh pendulums at home ahah
 MSmits: lol..
 ThunderbirdOne: i have a friend whos doing physics in uni... all labs cancelled... so yeah :P
 tonowak: Illedan it seems that I don't see any of my MSG on the visualizer on the IDE, nor the text saying what actions a player did. It isn't normal, right?
 dbdr: egaetan now you pull me down
 egaetan: it'seems i correct my timeouts
 egaetan: for sure i pull you down i want to climb upper
 dbdr: whatever for?&#160;;)
 dbdr: mchl12 just never submit again and you'll be fine&#160;;)
 dbdr: egaetan what did you do against your timeouts?
 egaetan: lot of small things
 egaetan: i think the biggest win was a stream on a array from a split
 Illedan: tonowak, can you give a replay?
 mchl12: I will probably submit once someone takes my place, or when I get too impatient haha
 YannT: egaetan: ah so it WAS the split for you too :D
 tonowak: Illedan all of the games don't show any text
 dbdr: split probably pulls lots of unicode data
 tonowak: and btw, I'm on another laptop than normally
 YannT: isn't the bottom of the viewer just cut off? :p 
 tonowak: but there is also some text above the bottom, if I recall correctly?
 tonowak: i do not see any letter
 egaetan: YannT yes it seems to be related
 Illedan: Wierd
 Illedan: I can't see your messages in the viewer either
 Illedan: do you use some wierd |? :P 
 YannT: egaetan: would make sense, if Kotlin has a classloading thing with split, Java would have it too
 tonowak: no, my submitted code doesn't use any MSG
 tonowak: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/XseX9d5">https://imgur.com/a/XseX9d5</a>
 tonowak: but my in the IDE does
 YannT: oh yeah you've got no text at all
 tonowak: yeah, zero letters :P
 YannT: missing font or CSS style?
 tonowak: probably yes
 Illedan: Inspect it
 Illedan: and check if you get any errors
 Illedan: we are using Arial
 Illedan: should be fine..
 YannT: not on a stock linux install maybe
 YannT: no ttf by default
 tonowak: I'm on Arch linux
 tonowak: that's possible
 dbdr: another font should always be used as a fallback
 YannT: do you have that ttf package thing on it?
 tonowak: Arial? I would have to check
 YannT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microsoft_fonts">https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Microsoft_fonts</a>
 YannT: maybe
 dbdr: "I don't have the exact font specified? let's ignore the text"I don't think that's how it works
 YannT: shouldn't but who knows
 dbdr: yeah, can be a bug
 dbdr: display driver possibly
 tonowak: on my main PC I have Arch and I remember that I installed microsoft fonts. Here probably I didn't
 tonowak: I just installed the ms fonts. Still the same problem
 YannT:&#160;:(
 YannT: did you do 
 YannT: fc-cache -f
 YannT: to regenerate the cache?
 tonowak: shouldn't it do it automatically?
 YannT: can't hurt&#160;:)
 tonowak: still
 dbdr: start your browser from the terminal
 dbdr: see if there is any error message
 dbdr: you probably need to quit it first
 tonowak: hmm on chromium it is working
 dbdr: otherwise it does not really start
 tonowak: I'm using Brave
 dbdr: report a bug on brave&#160;:)
 YannT: oh, probably it's some CSS compatibility thing with that browser then
 tonowak: brave is chromium-based&#160;:(
 tonowak: I'll first update the system and brave
 YannT: maybe it is insufficiently chromium based :p 
 tonowak: yeah but remember that on my second device with Arch and Brave it is working
 dbdr: software is not correct when it sometimes works, but when it always works&#160;;)
 emh: Illedan what happened? broke it?
 Illedan: hm?
 Illedan: Broke what?
 emh: your placement. your bot
 AntiSquid: emh's heart :p
 Illedan: Yeah, it's only doing silence and move
 Illedan: Working on a new bot.
 Illedan: And I kept losing focus of being too high ranked
 Illedan: As this is a Marathon, not a Sprint :P
 emh: ah hehe
 Illedan: Should be done with something tomorrow or thursday
 Illedan: Want to try and break the Mine strategy. Else we have to consider nerfing something
 Illedan: +1 charge makes it 33% worse. Which might be a good idea. But I don't know yet
 AntiSquid: is last change happening this friday?
 Illedan: I was thinking yesterday, but cg says on friday. So I'll follow CG and try to find some good balance point if needed.
 mchl12: Giving mines +1 cd also makes hybrid strategies weaker, because you cannot place 'some' mines and still do other things.
 AntiSquid: even if it's just about adjusting heuristics, i think there should be a clear deadline somewhere
 AntiSquid: where no more changes are made until after contest
 Illedan: Was just one of the idea mchl12&#160;:) Have to test it properly.
 Illedan: Games is fun anyway at the moment, don't want to break that
 mchl12: Just wanted to share my thoughts, but I agree that the games are fun currently.
 mchl12: I think no matter what you do, sometime there will be an optimal strategy.
 YannT: I'm #8 with literally nothing coded regarding mines
 YannT: not sure it's actually *that* powerful in the end
 YannT: (and I still have some improvements possible without even touching mines still)
 Illedan: Of course mchl12, but mines feels a little too random sometimes&#160;:) 
 TomerBG: Hey guys, can split your code to files and submit it?
 Illedan: Yeah, but you have to merge them before you submit
 Illedan: What lang?
 TomerBG: cpp
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/quom-split-your-code-base-into-multiple-files/79324">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/quom-split-your-code-base-into-multiple-files/79324</a>If that doesn't work. Try to search the forum for other options&#160;:)
 TomerBG: thanks
 AntiSquid: italy 6k wtf 
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid at least it's going down in new cases
 AntiSquid: how's your bot Zarbas&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX 
 ZarthaxX: there is a guy called zarbas here?
 ZarthaxX: evolving i guess, how is yours squido
 AntiSquid: i barely managed to get rid of some persistent bugs regarding enemy position
 AntiSquid: don't have a real bot strategy in place yet
 ZarthaxX: i see, plenty of time anyway
 AntiSquid: and plenty of headaches 
 ZarthaxX: lol :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: annoying game for you
 AntiSquid: very much so
 AntiSquid: i got an idea but it will take a while to write and then to sort out any possible bugs or issues
 ZarthaxX: perfect contest for that then&#160;:)
 egaetan: i hope 
 egaetan: maybe not enough
 AntiSquid: to think that might not even be the gold boss&#160;:(
 mchl12: Did you fix the timeout egaetan?
 egaetan: it seems, will check at the end of the submit
 Azkellas: Yeah, how do you evaluate your current bot compared to usual leagues? Would you say you have a top (10-day) gold bot? Lower / higher? 
 mchl12: I honestly have no clue, this is the first contest where I get out of wood.
 mchl12: Looks like it was enough egaetan, wp
 egaetan: ouufff
 egaetan: was close
 egaetan: mchl12 your turn to broke the leaderboard
 mchl12: I'm on it
 mchl12: Your bot is already in the IDE
 egaetan: no play against others&#160;!
 egaetan: Azkellas, i've got a top silver bot i think
 Azkellas: Only top silver? :o I expected higher
 Azkellas: Thanks!
 egaetan: i could not the tuesday have a top gold bot ... :p
 Azkellas: It's sometimes possible, depends on the challenge
 AntiSquid: probably top gold bot
 YannT: too early to tell
 YannT: no one's written a simulation yet AFAIK
 YannT: it's usually pretty gamechanging
 AntiSquid: isn't enemy prediction part of the simulation?
 YannT: turn 0 prediction no, that's just a heuristic
 egaetan: Now that i don't have any timeouts, i can rewrite all for simulations... :p
 pb4: How does the game handle a command like MOVE N TORPEDO when I already have full charges on the torpedo&#160;?
 pb4: does it discard the whole move command as invalid&#160;?
 YannT: doesn't do anything
 pb4: or just not charge anything&#160;?
 pb4: thanks
 mchl12: Your move goes through and you charge nothing
 AntiSquid: how important is it to keep track about what the enemy's tracking 
 mchl12: I'd say that it is pretty important, you will know when to silence and when you can continue chasing the opponent for example.
 mchl12: You can also use it to find out how much information certain actions will reveal.
 HuyCuto: hello
 Scarfield: hi
 HuyCuto: goodbye
 Scarfield: :wave:
 HuyCuto: hello
 egaetan: hello
 Schneewittchen: hey ho
 HuyCuto: kono dio da
 HuyCuto: i'm stuck man
 HuyCuto: mar lander ep 1
 HuyCuto: how tf can i do that
 HuyCuto: i'm disabled
 Uljahn: go play fortnite, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: which is what i heard
 HuyCuto: no
 HuyCuto: don't disappoint me
 HuyCuto: i can still do it
 HuyCuto: where is the solution button
 Scarfield: dont exceed max velocity
 HuyCuto: :ok_hand:
 HuyCuto: i dont get it
 ZarthaxX: just crash dude
 HuyCuto:&#160;:(
 HuyCuto: vertical is what
 HuyCuto:&#160;:(
 HuyCuto: i don't learn engrisk very well
 Uljahn: rest in rip
 Scarfield: there is downwards acc of 3.711 iirc, and max thrust is 4. so to reduce downwards velocity, you need thrust of 4
 HuyCuto: oke
 HuyCuto: thank
 HuyCuto: just printf 0 4 okay&#160;?
 Scarfield: try it
 Scarfield: its almost enough&#160;;)
 HuyCuto: no
 HuyCuto: it's fly upward
 HuyCuto: i hate you
 HuyCuto: how could you lie me
 ZarthaxX: scarfo he is just trollling
 Scarfield: yea seems like it
 HuyCuto: no
 HuyCuto: this task donot have a solution button
 HuyCuto:&#160;:(
 HuyCuto: okay
 HuyCuto: EZ
 HuyCuto: i solve it
 HuyCuto: haha
 HuyCuto: i'm a genius
 Uljahn: you're level 4 while Automaton2000 is level 14 so he is 3.5 times more genius than you :smirk:
 Automaton2000: or do you make a ga for any of the other moves
 HuyCuto:&#160;:(
 HuyCuto: can so help me pls&#160;:(((
 egaetan: Automaton2000 do you want to help&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i'm trying to solve the ascii art puzzle?
 OmidSafari: hi
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: 15 level soon?
 Automaton2000: if you just want to get a 100% winrate
 Scarfield: me too
 yfprojects: Did Automaton2000 get all his Xp by its own or did he get help?
 Automaton2000: i didn't think that would be great
 HuyCuto: he is a bot
 yfprojects: Thats why I am asking
 tonowak: so if two players have trueskill a and b, what is the expected winrate for player a? Do we know it?
 AntiSquid: ask magus about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and now i have to type it
 RalphMcCrackenIII: Hey, all!
 PJA: is it possible that printing a lot to stderr takes a lot of time
 PJA:&#160;?
 735487: PJA: sure it is
 PJA: amurushkin ty
 ZarthaxX: PJA there was a contest where i timeouted everytime because of lots of stderr
 ZarthaxX: so try to disable them for submit
 PJA: ok thx
 Magus: i needed to get Automaton2000 level 3 for the chat
 Automaton2000: but how can you see what i do know
 Magus: so i copy/pasted my nintendo solution
 Magus: but after that, Automaton2000 earned 2500xp "by itself" with the A*C contest
 Automaton2000: you don't see the point of that
 Scarfield: xD
 Earthborne: First submition yey! How do you think I'll do Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: how did you write a bot that has a good bot for it
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah yes write a bot for a bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: Earthborne my first submission does nothing but move to a valid location lol
 Earthborne: Haha, I didn't want to submit until I could beat the boss
 PJA: in bronze against who do u run your bot in test?
 mchl12: Personally I run versus egaetan. You can also consider nagrarok, he is rank 45 with only torpedoes, great to test your basics against.
 PJA: ty
 PJA: and btw nagrarok uses sonar now
 mchl12: ah I wasn't aware, as long as he doesn't use silence I'm happy
 egaetan: stop playing against me mchl12
 mchl12: don't think I can cancel a submission&#160;;)
 egaetan: or i will start to use silence&#160;!
 mchl12: not silence! anything but silence!
 egaetan: better silence X x|MOVE x SILENCE
 BenjaminUrquhart: SILENCE
 BenjaminUrquhart: thanks for coming to my ted talk
 BenjaminUrquhart: have a nice day
 Insta-x: how to do custom match with someone?
 Insta-x: owh nvm
 Insta-x: i just got it
 darkhorse64: Do you remember that ocean is sometimes called "the worl of silence"
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 darkhorse64: *world*
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday evening i was #19now #10 without submitting anything :thinking:
 Waffle3z: resubmit and end up in 30th
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because the mine bug was fixed and my tracker is no longer broken
 ZarthaxX: code fixing itself, innovative toad
 darkhorse64: If you can't fix your bot, fix the referee
 AntiSquid: what's wrong with the referee now?
 eulerscheZahl: nothing afaik
 Illedan: Only visuals.
 eulerscheZahl: but fixing visuals can add logic bugs, as the past taught us
 darkhorse64: What if the map was a twisted torus&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: twisted?
 eulerscheZahl: i know what a torus is. but twisted?
 Scarfield: mobiius torus :thinking:
 AntiSquid: twisted torus<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/014/187/774/large/keir-3d-infinitorus2-smooth-0-00-01-27.jpg?1542868184">https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/014/187/774/large/keir-3d-infinitorus2-smooth-0-00-01-27.jpg?1542868184</a>
 eulerscheZahl: we should give an instruction how to build it with paper instead of a proper definition for sure
 darkhorse64: like the one for detective pikatcha
 AntiSquid: ya lol why not make the game worse than it is&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: this image gives me headache
 AntiSquid: sorry, no disrespect meant
 Scarfield: i guess you mean that the map "wraps" in West-East and North-South?
 Scarfield: there is a term for it, but cant recall
 darkhorse64: Yes. Ofc, I was kidding although a circular map would make tracking a bit more difficult
 mchl12: Are you ready for more matches egaetan?
 egaetan: no
 egaetan: mchl12 i said no
 AntiSquid: the number 1 hair band is hard to keep
 mchl12: you were too late&#160;:)
 mchl12: wala is holding me back though
 Swagboy: Illedan a nice visual fix would be to display the last frame when a submarine is destroyed
 Swagboy: Right now you don't see the last torpedo fired when you destroy your opponent, would be much more pleasant if we did!
 eulerscheZahl: he knows that already :D
 pb4: Is there a way to highlight your timeouts in a submit nowadays&#160;?
 pb4: by random sampling, it seems that I lose a lot by timeout
 egaetan: i developped a simple tool for that
 egaetan: parsing replays one by one
 pb4: shareable&#160;? ^^
 egaetan: -&gt; mp
 PJA: how do u choose where to move to? just trying to avoid been tracked?
 egaetan: it may be a beginning
 struct: Are the mines going to be changed or you dont know?
 Illedan: Most likely not.
 AntiSquid: what do you plan to change anyway
 Slash-Dev: Hi, I'm wondering if there is not a (another?) mine bug. If a mine is at [2, 5] and a ship is right below the mine (South of the map so [2, 6]), and writes:MOVE N SILENCE|TRIGGER 2 5Should it get hit by 1 or 2?
 struct: 1 i think
 BenjaminUrquhart: actions are processed in order
 Illedan: give a replay?
 Slash-Dev: OK so 2 in that case?
 Illedan: Should be 2 yeah
 Slash-Dev: OK, then there is no bug&#160;:)
 struct: ah rihgt 2
 Slash-Dev: Thank you
 struct: read wrong
 Illedan: phew
 struct: no more bugs&#160;:)
 jrke: can anyone of you come in clash of code:slight_smile:
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: do sub wars
 jrke: why
 BenjaminUrquhart: ocean of code
 struct: but I find a viewer "bug"
 Slash-Dev: I thought I read somewhere that the damage was determined on the position at the beginning of the turn so I was confused.
 struct: I dont think it needs fix though
 struct: A bit hard to fix
 BenjaminUrquhart: struct there's no such things as no bugs
 jrke: i have bored working on it so i am playing clash of code
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh

 Slash-Dev: And that's called a moderator&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: i gave moral support
 egaetan: i need some AntiSquid
 mchl12: moral support won't give you those .01 elo points egaetan...
 egaetan: oops spotted
 AntiSquid: you used java and the gap is very narrow, so that's definitely good
 AntiSquid: c++ is the fastest i mean
 AntiSquid: actually you didn't give up, i am taking a break until i find the motivation to rewrite a big chunck
 AntiSquid: stay positive
 AntiSquid: ok forget everything i just said you dropped another 0.01, it's all over now
 BenjaminUrquhart: alright my tracker is finished enough, time for me to join the fight
 struct: Just add java optimization flags
 BenjaminUrquhart: not sure you can add flags to the jvm at runtime

 eulerscheZahl: ascii(69) = E
 AntiSquid: direction 69 :thinking: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i am trying to make it even worse

 eulerscheZahl: if both die, it's a draw
 eulerscheZahl: 2 stars below the viewer confirm that
 wlesavo: oh i see
 wlesavo: thx
 wlesavo: maybe adding a win/lose/draw message to summary would be a good idea
 eulerscheZahl: you have the endscreen showing the ranking
 eulerscheZahl: both 1st = it's a draw
 wlesavo: oh im really stupid
 wlesavo: never noticed that
 eulerscheZahl: inexperienced with the CG platform
 eulerscheZahl: the endscreen is a standard module, not done specifically for this contest

 eulerscheZahl: are you sure?
 eulerscheZahl: the colors below the replay are wrong
 egaetan: sure
 eulerscheZahl: CG somehow fails to indicate the player for 1 player per turn games

 eulerscheZahl: ILLEDAN
 wlesavo: lul thats a nice bug
 eulerscheZahl: i better try it on discord, easier to catch him there
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice enum fail
 eulerscheZahl: so that's why mchl12 is so high? making the opponent lose by printing nonsense?
 BenjaminUrquhart: lmao
 AntiSquid: blame that on not being first! :p
 egaetan: yes i think
 egaetan: mchl12 you are discovered
 AntiSquid: probably bribed Illedan
 wlesavo: 69 is a secret code to win

 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: luckily i only have to forward it :imp:
 struct: Strange bug
 blasterpoard: eulerscheZahl I think there's a very minor mistake in the statement
 blasterpoard: at the very bottom, there is a list of actions
 Zenoscave: the space after silence?
 Zenoscave: err surface
 blasterpoard: SONAR should be SONAR x
 eulerscheZahl: can't blame Illedan on that one&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: dont mind me I need new glasses. I have bad vision for spaces
 eulerscheZahl: will fix but not deploy before a more relevant fix is done toothanks for reporting blasterpoard
 mchl12: noo, you found my strategy
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 muy31: is there a way to be sure that your torpedo hit the enemy?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: was just working through that myself lol
 muy31: i'm thinking if the change in the opponent's life is 2
 BenjaminUrquhart: what if they hit themselves though
 muy31: exactly
 muy31: so is it probably smart to not do that
 AntiSquid: chance they hit themselves on same turn =&#160;?
 muy31: or to do it with a lot of conditions?
 muy31: yes
 AntiSquid: if they hit themselves they are nearby / tried hitting you&#160;? if you got hit then you know?
 muy31: i just want input in case someone else kind of figured it out
 muy31: that's kind of makes sense
 muy31: thanks
 BenjaminUrquhart: or wait
 BenjaminUrquhart: if they took damage and they didn't fire a torpedo
 AntiSquid: if they hit themselves you know through enemy command and proximity of their torpedo to your torpedo 
 muy31: ok that makes even better sense
 Zenoscave: Good idea
 mchl12: The basic idea of what I used is: 1) make a list of all explosions on the map 2) calculate how much hp the opponent lost 3) for each possible position, find out the hp they would have lost to all the explosions on the map 4) if the hp they should have lost does not equal the acutal lost hp, they cannot be at this position
 muy31: dang
 muy31: i'm just gonna copy that into my notes
 muy31: thank you very much
 Zenoscave: thanks mchl12
 muy31: maybe i'll beat you with it later&#160;;)
 mchl12: No problem, just make sure you keep track of the opponent's movements as well and adjust this algorithm accordingly
 muy31: yeah
 AntiSquid: if you beat him you need to get #1, nobody wants to lose to 2nd best
 muy31: lol
 muy31: I'm just trying
 muy31: right now
 egaetan: same as mchl12 but in java
 accorp: no one else remembers that batman problem on CG?
 mchl12: the binary search one?
 Uljahn: shadow of the knight?
 accorp: exactly
 accorp: if the guy moves to the right, he can't be possibly on the far left
 AntiSquid: but he might be just trying to cause confusion?
 muy31: no accorp is exactly correct
 muy31: if by far left he means leftmost
 AntiSquid: if he means the edge .
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: or actually rightmost edge
 accorp: that's right
 AntiSquid: well yeah that was obvious? i mean how else did you get to bronze lol
 muy31: haha
 accorp: furthermore, apply and island map and info is suddenly appearing...
 accorp: an*
 muy31: you are still stating the obvious
 accorp: newcomers can't possibly know that, right?
 muy31: as soon as we read the game description, i'm sure most realized it
 muy31: but maybe ou are right
 muy31: about some newcomers
 AntiSquid: they deserve the wood if they don't realize this
 accorp: harsh
 muy31: hey i'm in wood 1 right now
 muy31: but im getting there
 AntiSquid: just use silence in wood 1, easy promotion .
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: But i like to develop my AI as much as possible
 AntiSquid: yeah i mean if you promoted to wood 1 then you done the tedious first part
 muy31: before submitting
 AntiSquid: there's more headaches to come
 muy31: i guess
 accorp: I think mines will be the OP solution here
 AntiSquid: easier to integrate it all if you can see all commands
 muy31: it's really annoying when there are newly added rules
 muy31: that's exactly true
 RalphMcCrackenIII: Coming from C++ to Python3, for loops in Python3 are so different.
 AntiSquid: why are mines OP&#160;? 
 muy31: but i have a sense of what to expect
 AntiSquid: reduce enemy possible positions without immediately revealing self?
 muy31: so im building towards that
 AntiSquid: no trust me, it won't be enough
 accorp: yeah, only what you think about
 AntiSquid: stuck here at the edge of getting pushed out of top 100 because i didn't plan correctly 
 muy31: AntiSquid you are talking to me or accorp
 AntiSquid: to you
 muy31: oh
 muy31: ok
 AntiSquid: this should be enough for silver, won't bother changing anything until i need to promote .
 dbdr: nice kovi!
 kovi: thx
 accorp: i'm having my bot trigger mines even if one cell is reduced and it works wonders
 dbdr: more and more people in top 10
 Scarfield: xD
 AntiSquid: there can only be 10
 pb4: dat... statement...
 dbdr: AntiSquid genius
 AntiSquid: highlander movie thought me
 muy31: agreed
 AntiSquid: taught *
 accorp: dealing with silence is a bitch, isn't it?
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: dull
 accorp: i'm having it expand by 1 so far but if i make it to higher leagues i'll have it to 4
 Illedan: pb4, nice
 pb4: thanks
 kovi: gratz
 AntiSquid: ah that's why you figure out where i am, i don't really bother to move far away, being greedy on space i cover for surface
 AntiSquid: accorp
 accorp: yeah&#160;:)
 Glenn: If you move and torpedo in the same turn, is the max range of the torpedo 4 tiles from your location before or after the move?
 muy31: before
 dbdr: after
 Tiramon: the actions are handled in the order you give
 Glenn: Always? Or does it matter which order the commands are issued?
 muy31: you torpedo when you are on (x,y)
 AntiSquid: which order are you doing the actions lol
 muy31: for real!
 Tiramon: so move|torpedo = aftertorpedo|move = before
 Glenn: I'm calculating for my opponent, so I need to handle both.
 AntiSquid: yes
 Glenn: Ok, thanks Tiramon, that's what I'm looking for.
 Scarfield: you could silence 4 N|move N|torpedo for even more range
 Glenn: Lol, good point, but I'm not quite there yet.&#160;:)
 accorp: I thought you can't silence and move at the same round?
 AntiSquid: you can
 AntiSquid: you can use all actions at once apparently
 muy31: so is the only command that can come by itself "SURFACE"?
 Scarfield: only one charge though (?)
 AntiSquid: one charge
 AntiSquid: charge is always on the move command
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: ok
 AntiSquid: quite sure you can still use surface with the rest, but why would you
 AntiSquid: unless it's the last square
 Scarfield: or a minefield ahead
 muy31: so i should always check for everything?
 Tiramon: surface followed by silence to obscure where you are is not the worst move
 accorp: why wouldn't you silent move after surface?
 muy31: every command?
 Scarfield: the commands that you see your opponent has done
 Glenn: You can also surface and then move which might put you in a different sector
 Uljahn: muy31: MSG could be used by itself too
 Glenn: if you were on the border. That'll mess up a lot of people
 AntiSquid: lol Uljahn
 muy31: Uljahn i meant only by itself
 Uljahn: ye
 muy31: like no pipe
 Uljahn: ah
 AntiSquid: then i just MSG enemy and stand still all day
 Uljahn: i thought you mean without arguments
 muy31: i understand
 Scarfield: MSG MOVE N|MINE E|TORPEDO 3 6
 AntiSquid: good that will show him
 Scarfield: has ille gone in hiding?
 AntiSquid: testing enemy prediction
 Illedan: I'll submit in a few days
 Illedan: Had to stop my bot code and rewrite the referee now. So that I can keep my sanity.
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Illedan: Unit test inc. :relieved:
 accorp: huh, you can actually silence and move
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 Illedan: Sure thing
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's both a blessing and a curse
 accorp: so you want to silence first
 Illedan: Not always
 AntiSquid: the options are endless
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: only 100 rush
 Illedan: *ish
 accorp: why would I move first?
 Illedan: For the first action of a round :D
 Illedan: move to get better torpedo range. Torpedo to damage. Surface to clear old path. Silence to get away accorp
 accorp: that would be an extreme edge case
 Illedan: Those are what brings you to legend :D
 accorp: don't agree
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 Scarfield: why would you silence first anyway, 4 + 1 = 1 + 4
 JBM: i'll be streaming haskell nonsense again in like ~5'<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm/">https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm/</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: screw with enemy prediction
 accorp: I'm thinking that if you silence and then move, that would really eef up prediction
 Scarfield: but it should be the same as move then silence
 Scarfield: or i am getting too tired
 accorp: not the same
 muy31: i'm thinking it doesn't matter if your enemy isn't trying to predict you
 muy31: but just find you
 AntiSquid: depends which one gets you more move space on the silence ... so either could be better
 Scarfield: thats true though
 accorp: hm, instersting
 blasterpoard: I've been debugging an off by one error in my bitboards for the last 2 hours... turns out I forgot that 1st line of input is width/height
 accorp: but if you wanna screw prediction, like  BenjaminUrquhart said...
 blasterpoard: and that's why my maps were wrong
 ZarthaxX: im sorry for you blasty that's sad
 ZarthaxX: are you using a 256 bits variable?
 blasterpoard: no, 15x uint16_t
 Illedan: is that faster?
 blasterpoard: maybe?
 Scarfield: in open water the enemy prediction will be the same no matter the order of silence and move, but as squid said, what gives silence the most cells to reach will screw the most
 blasterpoard: easier to wrok with, imho
 ZarthaxX: bitset isn't comparable?
 accorp: the problem is that if you expand every position you already have for op for 4 cells in every direction, when they move, you have to expand those too
 accorp: this is an exponential...
 accorp: island or no island, you can't rely on that
 mlomb: I rely on that
 mlomb: kinda
 mlomb: I store the visited cells on each stat
 mlomb: state*
 mlomb: if you remove all the possibilities it ends up not being that much
 ZarthaxX: he is just lying, it's a hell
 AntiSquid: "not much"
 mlomb: I have a trigger if they are too many I just cut down some
 mlomb: but its high
 Scarfield: the way i track silence is i check for cells the opponent could be, that touches water where i know the opponent cant be, then apply the 1-4 cells in different directions
 accorp: I don't think too many bots are doing more than 1 cell per silent move. That would be a turning point for this league, but not now
 Scarfield: i am not yet :p
 BenjaminUrquhart: I am, but you can't tell through all the timeouts from not handling surface correctly :eyes:
 accorp: Scarfield, try only 1, I'm pretty sure of this, and it can't hurt to try. Although, I have a failsafe, which resets the assumption and starts all over...
 Scarfield: i am silencing, but only by one, thats what i meant&#160;:)
 kingofnumbers: "Are there any prizes to win?In the current situation, we're unable to ensure the delivery of prizes to winners."
 kingofnumbers: does it mean there will be no prizes for sure 
 kingofnumbers: or it means it could be&#160;? 
 mchl12: it's not about the prizes, it's about the fun we have together in this bot programming competition&#160;:)
 Scarfield: but my point was just the way i do the silence tracking, the order shouldnt really make that much of a difference, since i find the "edges", but of course the will be more edges if move is done first, i just dont think it will mean that much
 kingofnumbers: mchl12, still my question is valid&#160;:) 
 AntiSquid: don't care about prizes, although there usually are t-shirts at least, this contest was done last minute for the sake of keeping people busy during the covid lockdown
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't expect more than t-shirts for top 20 or so kingofnumbers
 kingofnumbers: AntiSquid I know this, but just asking because that sentences wasn't really clear 
 AntiSquid: welcome to CG
 kingofnumbers: I feel like you are treating my like a greedy guy just because I asked this question 
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: you missunderstand
 AntiSquid: the lack of clarity happens from time to time
 kingofnumbers: two guys immediately said "it's not about prizes it's more about fun "
 kingofnumbers: even though my question was valid 
 AntiSquid: i didn't say fun
 AntiSquid: this game ain't fun for me
 Scarfield: we all think that you are greedy :p
 kingofnumbers: Scarfield lol ok 
 Uljahn: you shouldn't ask random guys, ask community manager :smirk:
 AntiSquid: ya i didn't mean it that way, as in it's not about the prizes ... i mean i just don't care in this instance if i say magically got 1st place and didn't win anything
 Scarfield: honestly the contest is the prize in itself right now
 accorp: there are prizes?
 kingofnumbers: Scarfield, as I said: still my question was valid, please don't make such replies to my question 
 AntiSquid: IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRIZE ACCORP!! /s
 muy31: BIG BRUH MOMENT
 Scarfield: it was a joke, hence the smiley&#160;;)
 Uljahn: the main prize is another contest in may if you'll be still alive :smiley:
 muy31: lol
 Scarfield: can cats get the virus?
 accorp: :D
 AntiSquid: well if it mutates the right way i guess so&#160;?
 kingofnumbers: if the contest is "not about prizes" 
 kingofnumbers: I would ask the organizers please go to FAQ page 
 kingofnumbers: under question "Are there any prizes to win?" 
 kingofnumbers: please put this as reply "it's not about prizes, this contest is the prize itself" 
 kingofnumbers: instead of " In the current situation, we're unable to ensure the delivery of prizes to winners."
 AntiSquid: kingofnumbers let's forget about this please, the chat will take any opportunity to talk random gibberish about anything, since it's usually very quiet in here
 AntiSquid: don't read too much into it
 muy31: are you kind of salty
 AntiSquid: @_@
 muy31: that was for kingofnumbers
 AntiSquid: i take it personally muy31
 AntiSquid: if you have a problem with me, i'll let you know that Automaton2000 is my paid bodyguard
 Automaton2000: i can't even get to silver
 muy31: RIP me #7 wants to take me down
 Astrobytes: chill out kingofnumbers
 AntiSquid: wow i am cutting you pay Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: still working on my own
 Scarfield: and i dont think anyone knows if there will be prices anyway, im just saying the contest is very much appreciated in this time of staying at home
 mchl12: wanted to clarify that my reply was not meant seriously, it was not my intent to disregard your question kingofnumbers
 accorp: so, if a torpedo or a mine is exploded, there's only 3 options, right?
 Scarfield: how so?
 Uljahn: it depends
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by 3 options&#160;?
 Scarfield: you mean 1, 2 or 3 damage?
 Scarfield: 0,1,2 *
 AntiSquid: if they overlap it's 4 damage
 Scarfield: if the opponent moved before exlpoding torpedo/mine the turn after you exploded torp/mine its a headache :p
 AntiSquid: i need sleep, will kick myself out, good night
 Scarfield: gn
 muy31: bye bye
 muy31: it's 5:30 where I am
 muy31: pm
 muy31: how about you?
 accorp: a guy could be hit dead center, adjacent or not at all
 Scarfield: 11.30 pm, so Altered Carbon is imminent :p
 muy31: lol
 Scarfield: yea if only on explosion went of, there are those 3
 Uljahn: accorp: with separate explosion yes
 Scarfield: but if you fired, and next turn the opponent moves then fires, there are some cases that will be tricky
 Scarfield: if simultaneous explosions (no movement in between) its just adding the damage up for each cell
 accorp: Uljahn, only an isolated explosion would do it, right?
 accorp: One that occurred alone in a round
 accorp: my god this got complicated&#160;:)
 Scarfield: yup
 Scarfield: so dont fire anything the turn after i fired!
 accorp: firing can be dangerous, yes
 accorp: but you can fire and reveal
 Scarfield: yea, i havent implemented using sonar yet, my torpedos are my sonar :p
 accorp: my bot actually fires only when certain, but I need to work on that
 BenjaminUrquhart: my game controller doesn't like surfacing &gt;.&gt;
 kingofnumbers: my understanding that every torpedo or mine doesn't interfere with other torpedo or mine, damage for each one will be calculated separately
 OmidSafari: hi
 mchl12: Scarfield, try keeping a list of all explosions, and as soon as the enemy moves, change the locations of all explosions in the direction of their move. This should help with opponents firing after moving.
 Scarfield: yea, started implementing that, "shifting" a map of the explosions, then i thought what if they silenced as well :P
 Scarfield: will have to be for tomorrow
 Scarfield: but ty for the tip&#160;:)
 accorp: does anyone see any good in sonar? i'm struggling to see a benefit, but all see are edge cases...
 kingofnumbers: well, if you have good prediction system, sonar could help increase its accuracy 
 Scarfield: i think it will matter more, when more people start silencing further
 kingofnumbers: I think sonar will not matter in low leagues 
 kingofnumbers: but only in advanced matches 
 accorp: but thinking about its nature
 mchl12: So far I find sonar most useful when the opponent has many possible positions, as soon as I have more certainty on the opponent's whereabouts I switch to mines. Not sure if this is a good strategy though.
 mchl12: Having 2 mines directly next to eachother seems unecessary, which means you sometimes have a turn or two to charge your sonar.
 accorp: having sonar on 1 possible location in a sector?
 accorp: that would either eliminate or have one
 TheFlashDemon_6b40: hi guys, where are you?
 mchl12: if you want to play consistently (which you do), you want to sonar the sector with the highest chance of the opponent's presence
 mchl12: anything else is high risk, high reward
 accorp: that would eliminate the less..?
 mchl12: using sonar on the sector with the least possibilities, would also result in less, because the answer will most likely be no
 mchl12: if the answer is no on a big sector, you can eliminate multiple places
 accorp: because he would move out, reacting on the sonar?
 Illedan: You also want to eliminate closer sectors first. 
 kingofnumbers: Illedan, do you mean closer to my submarine? why&#160;?
 accorp: open fire
 Scarfield: bigger threat, than being further away
 Illedan: If you are correct. Fire.
 Illedan: If he is far away. Nothing will happen in a lot of rounds anyway..
 Illedan: Closer and you can start shooting to narrow further
 Scarfield: well, gonna call it a day - gn
 mchl12: good point
 kingofnumbers: it doesn't seem good strategy to me 
 Illedan: Good thing there is no right approach&#160;;)
 kingofnumbers: yeah, I said "seem" and "to me" 
 Illedan: ^^
 accorp: I play defence in most games until I understand them, but when I find a good offence I usually get to lefend
 accorp: legend*
 accorp: that's why I think mines are the way to go on this one
 BenjaminUrquhart: so when my bot isn't throwing nullpointers it looks decent I guess<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442088595">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442088595</a>
 OmidSafari: hello
 icecream17: what's a tooltip?
 BenjaminUrquhart: the little tabs on the progress bar
 icecream17: ok. I wish this would always happen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442078610">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/442078610</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: before I click
 BenjaminUrquhart: is it a 1x1 hole someone spawned in
 BenjaminUrquhart: close enough
 icecream17: yes?
 kingofnumbers: icecream17, lol 
 kingofnumbers: I think you should report that to the creators 
 kingofnumbers: or actually maybe it's intended, since you can choose your starting cell 
 BenjaminUrquhart: they know
 BenjaminUrquhart: intended
 kingofnumbers: ok then
 icecream17: i just delete every space that has less than 2 other spaces next to it.
 icecream17: but for a rectangle.... hmm
 BenjaminUrquhart: I floodfill and pick the largest area
 accorp: largest area / distance to starting point
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm 2 bugs away from getting out of the bottom of wood 1:MOVE null TORPEDOInvalid MOVE: obstacle or already visited cell
 accorp: it will make you reveal the least
 accorp: provided you picked the largest area starting point
 kingofnumbers: accorp or just go to largest area, and rely on silence to stay unknown 
 accorp: every move you make is powering something, but also reveling your position
 Zenoscave: oops. eulerscheZahl
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/442095173">https://www.codingame.com/replay/442095173</a>
 struct: it happened :p
 Zenoscave: Am I not the first to report?
 struct: It can happen, I posted seeds here yesterday of it 
 Zenoscave: nice
 Zenoscave: still on those seeds huh
 struct: nah
 struct: that was yesterday
 struct: But I think of it happening is very low
 struct: and also enemy should always choose the area with most ocean available
 Zenoscave: how many trials before you saw one?
 Zenoscave: 1M?
 struct: I tried to split in half
 struct: seed=1874286978
 Zenoscave: oops
 struct: I had better seed for splitting map in half, but lost it
 YannT: kovi: you have the sneakiest submarine in the realm :o
 YannT: I can't seem to torpedo you
 phaberthur: i need a good code
 Secundus: System.out.println("Hello World");
 Secundus: here you go
 phaberthur: :rage:
 icecream17: oooh, i can play my code against my code
 icecream17: oh, they pick the same square at the beginning...
 YannT: heyy ça push fort!
 YannT: par contre, bon, va vraiment falloir gérer les mines là
 YannT: #6, on peut aller se coucher&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: wrong channel&#160;;)
 YannT: oh shit&#160;;)
 YannT: sorry
 YannT: I blame it on the latenessq of the hour
 Zenoscave: No worries&#160;:) it must be quite late
 YannT: about time yeah
 YannT: I can't go any higher without having some description of mine handling I think
 kovi: nice submit
 YannT: I trained on you kovi
 YannT: you're the sneakiest submarine
 YannT: you've got good incertitude maximization&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Kovi. do you do full path or just current position for filtering positions
 icecream17: ok, icecream17, stop delaying, you know floodfill is the easiest way
 icecream17: this is harder than it seems. oh no
 BenjaminUrquhart: floooood
 BenjaminUrquhart: I finally found my invalid move issue. I forgot to update coordinates when silencing&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's now fixed well enough that I don't get a million losses instantly
 sudomakeinstall2: can you mine and trigger the same mine in one turn?
 BenjaminUrquhart: try it an see
 sudomakeinstall2: The default AI does it but the mine doesn't trigger, but I was under the assumption that you can do this. Wanted to make sure.
 mlomb: You can't
 BenjaminUrquhart: I've somehow managed to attempt to divide by zero
 BenjaminUrquhart: looks like my tracking needs some more work
 aangairbender: which positions do you guys have? e.g. I am top102 in bronze
 BenjaminUrquhart: 69 wood 1 due to some issues that cause my bot to crash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: What's the news from the world?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Trucks are spraying down our streets with some gas, and its not for mosquitos.
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh hey maybe I'll make it out of wood
 aangairbender: I guess u need just to move without using SURFACE very often and track enemy
 BenjaminUrquhart: yep I'm moving on to bronze
 BenjaminUrquhart: time fore more headaches
 aangairbender: bronze introduce mines, but I am just ignoring them for now
 aangairbender: there are still a lot places for improvement
 aangairbender: i track enemy, but i dont hide for tracking well
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have an interesting way of hiding, won't say more just yet&#160;:)
 aangairbender: just charging and using SILENCE when I dont know where the enemy is
 BenjaminUrquhart: I actively hunt the enemy
 aangairbender: but care, if you dont know where the enemy is and use TORPEDO, enemy will know that you are close to that shot
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's part of my hiding
 BenjaminUrquhart: :eyes:
 BenjaminUrquhart: or I should say it's handled by my hiding
 aangairbender: then it's ok
 aangairbender: go to bronze so I could make some pvp matches with you xD
 BenjaminUrquhart: just got there
 BenjaminUrquhart: having some move issues
 aangairbender: first match, a win for me
 BenjaminUrquhart: I know
 BenjaminUrquhart: there was a subtle bug in my state management
 aangairbender: oh, actually you won, but then you tried to go to already visited cell
 BenjaminUrquhart: ik
 aangairbender: how many lines of code do you have?
 BenjaminUrquhart: 814
 aangairbender: c++?
 BenjaminUrquhart: java
 aangairbender: ok, i have 500 c#
 SolForecast: Hey there, anyone up?
 aangairbender: y
 SolForecast: I'm seriously confused how to get the elevator floor from Don't Panic &gt;&gt;
 aangairbender: dont know the rules sorry
 aangairbender: do ocean of code!
 SolForecast: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/don&#39;t-panic-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/don't-panic-episode-1</a> It's over here if you could help ^^;
 SolForecast: gee. im still stuck on conditionals. I dont think i should head there yet
 aangairbender: i can see reading of elevator floor from the input in the default code
 aangairbender: what language do you use?
 SolForecast: python currently
 SolForecast: My idea right now is to just compare the position together to the direction, but I don't know how to call for said elevator position
 aangairbender: wait a min
 SolForecast: &gt;~&gt;?
 aangairbender: you could have two bool variablesfirst is whether elevator located to the left from the clonesecond is whether clone is going LEFTnow if these variables are equal you should print WAIT else BLOCK
 aangairbender: i guess
 SolForecast: er.Problem i had right now is I have no idea how do I call for the elevator's position
 SolForecast: I did get the basic gist so far. I just- don't understand what I'm supposed to do to call for each floor
 SolForecast: *'s elevator
 aangairbender: but you have reading of elevator_floor and elevator_position
 aangairbender: you could store that and use
 SolForecast: I can't seem to call it. It only gives out error that it simply doesnt exist
 aangairbender: i would create an array outside that for loop and append pairs of elevator_floor and elevator_pos to that arrat
 aangairbender: and then use it in my game cycle
 aangairbender: game loop*
 SolForecast: @-@
 aangairbender: because everything creating inside for disappears outside for loop
 aangairbender: it is called variable scope
 SolForecast: I honestly have no idea how python array works yet honestly-
 aangairbender: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0812619-d59c-4af8-a15d-24b59fdd27ec">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0812619-d59c-4af8-a15d-24b59fdd27ec</a>
 aangairbender: btw that can be googled
 aangairbender: i am not good with python, but basic idea to store that elevator data to some global variable
 SolForecast: waitSo array is just, a queue or something?
 aangairbender: yep
 aangairbender: kinda list
 SolForecast: fair enough. I'll give that a try
 aangairbender: good luck

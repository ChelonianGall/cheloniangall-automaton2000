 hackyouu: hello world
 crazy_ape: ouh
 Coding_Aria: hello world
 Thorcode: hi world
 derjack: good morning
 TheBlueBias: 'nin
 Thorcode: good morning derjack
 TheBlueBias:&#160;:(
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Thorcode: How can i handle all the number in the last line of fax machine?
 TheBlueBias: In the inputs?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: at the heart there is alot of input and It make me dizzy
 TheBlueBias: What language do you use?
 Thorcode: Python
 TheBlueBias: Well something like: [int(i) for i in input().split()]
 TheBlueBias: But that's probably already in the base code.
 Thorcode: nope
 Thorcode: it just input()
 TheBlueBias: Oh. Right.
 Thorcode: and in the fifth test case the input so long&#160;:(
 TheBlueBias: So. I gave this piece of code to you, but you'll have to learn about it. Search "list comprehension"
 Thorcode: thanks
 Thorcode: there is alot of stuff I didn't know in python&#160;:(
 TheBlueBias: Do you follow any course?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: a course on w3school
 TheBlueBias: Well you'll probably learn what's missing soon.
 Thorcode: list comprehension doesn't help me
 Thorcode: oh I get's it
 Thorcode: thanks TheBlueBlas
 TheBlueBias: :thumbsup:
 Thorcode: alot
 Thorcode: Wontonimo have a nice puzzle
 TechnoBot: Howdy'
 TechnoBot: Hello?
 Uljahn: :door:
 Thorcode: hi
 TheBlueBias: Bonus day on ICPC! \o/
 struct: why?
 Seii: iza no malagasy ato
 struct: English in this chat please
 Seii: sorry,  can't write english very well
 AntiSquid: there is #jp
 AntiSquid: although what you wrote doesn't look like a spoken language at all
 eulerscheZahl: TheBlueBias my reaction was more like :rage:
 struct: I agree euler
 struct: its unfair
 eulerscheZahl: no I'll ask my boss for an extra day off. still pissed, tell me earlier and I can plan. and be less disappointed when I drop in the last hours
 AntiSquid: ah malaysian&#160;? seii, well dont think anyone else here speaks it
 struct: Did they give any reason on why they extended the contest?
 Seii: sorry everyone
 derjack: oO
 AntiSquid: it was a joke, sir bubbleeyes
 eulerscheZahl: no reason. just "The contest duration has been extended to 5 days. The actual finish time is October 14, 2021, 00:00 UTC**"
 eulerscheZahl: the video announcement always said 5 days. maybe CF did it wrong in the first place?
 eulerscheZahl: and now CG down?
 eulerscheZahl: CF*
 eulerscheZahl: Oops! Probably Codeforces can't be reached right now or your Internet connection is broken. You can try:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/">https://codeforces.com/</a>
 AntiSquid: ya
 AntiSquid: it's down for me too
 eulerscheZahl: sounds serious. why not extend it to a full month because of this?
 AntiSquid: seen some other contests get randomly extended last minute, makes me wonder is it a "we don't like who's at the top so let's give it another try" sort of thing :D
 eulerscheZahl: i predicted tourist, NVAL, T1024 and wleite at the top ranks. only tourist still missing
 eulerscheZahl: but last time he also appeared close to the end already. has already submitted but really behind in ranking for now
 struct: nval comented on the day added
 eulerscheZahl: he's not the only one who ranted
 struct: I only saw 2/3 comments
 struct: but was on the official contest page
 eulerscheZahl: mine was the 4th comment about it
 eulerscheZahl: thought the more users write about it, the more likely they see what they did
 AntiSquid: i would invite some coworkers to post a rant too if i was angry about it 
 AntiSquid: 502 Bad Gateway on all pages
 TheBlueBias: Yeah. I understand euler. But since I didn't had the time to do a lot, for me it's more a good news...
 TheBlueBias: You're participating to ICPC too Squidy?
 AntiSquid: who's this guy calling me squidy&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: no, i looked it though
 eulerscheZahl: i would never do that. I always write squiddy with 2 d
 huhjo: sussy boy
 TheBlueBias: Meh... He doesn't recognize me...&#160;:(
 Overbed: where do i learn python 3 for free 
 Overbed: the basics
 C26_1: um
 C26_1: you can googles for yourself
 C26_1: or searching in Youtube
 Mundgus: w3scool
 Mundgus: geeksforgeeks
 Mundgus: for python learning
 C26_1: @Mundgus, yes explanatory websites
 TheBlueBias: Overbed <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=learn+python+basics">https://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=learn+python+basics</a>
 Overbed: thanks 
 C26_1: whoa
 TheBlueBias: :3
 C26_1: I've never seen a website that's like this
 C26_1: Set = contains unique things
 Overbed: is hyperskill.org a good website to learn python 3 from?
 Overbed: it isnt free but my school can fund me a bit
 C26_1: Array/List = contains a lot of things (may including copied things)
 Mundgus: If you search paid website, use udemy
 Overbed: onlineacademy?
 Mundgus: udemy.com
 Overbed: thanks
 C26_1: @Mundgus, struct (Only in C/C++/C#) = short-words for structure, somethings than contained multiple information about a object
 C26_1: @Mundgus, dictionary = one-to-one correspondence of info-checking
 C26_1: does that fact true or just simply false
 Mundgus: struct can contain functions, not just variables
 derjack: in c++ struct is just a class without private stuff
 Mundgus: Yep
 struct: I think it can still be private
 struct: its just public by default
 Saber-Tiger: What's up
 eulerscheZahl: do you have inheritance for structs?!
 eulerscheZahl: i always thought that's the main difference
 eulerscheZahl: and for C# structs are value types and not object types
 struct: you do have
 eulerscheZahl: ok. big difference between C++ and C#. to no surprise
 struct: They are exactly the same in c++, the only diference is that struct is public by default and class is private
 derjack: trust this guy, he knows a thing or two about structs
 derjack: loa has no longer WIP in title, but its still WIP?
 eulerscheZahl: no, it's VIP now
 kimsejin123: hi
 kimsejin123: feel very good
 derjack: :tada:
 miszu: finished 22nd in cvz. Need. To. Optimize. More
 Uljahn: :tada:
 miszu: what reasonable algorithm can be used when you have (2000x2000)^30 search space?
 eulerscheZahl: got the extra day off. still not happy about codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: just bruteforce it miszu
 eulerscheZahl: you are exaggerating the search space, it's only (2000x2000 x PI/4)^30
 Uljahn: NN or search space discretization i guess
 miszu: eulerscheZahl akchually.. it's (PI*1000^2)^30
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; 1000**2 * math.pi == 2000**2 * math.pi/4True
 eulerscheZahl: even python with possible rounding issues agrees that they are the same
 miszu: my trigs sucks then lol. I didn't get how you added a pi/4 at the end
 Uljahn: what's possible rounding issues in python? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; sum([0.1]*10)0.9999999999999999
 eulerscheZahl: case closed
 Uljahn: is it python's issue though?
 eulerscheZahl: IEEE754
 derjack: 0.1 + 0.2 =&#160;???????
 miszu: how good CMA-ES is?
 eulerscheZahl: how good your English is?
 miszu: anyone here used it and was satisfied?
 miszu: mmmm... English is 3rd language so not the best&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, just teasing&#160;;)
 miszu: haha that's cool :P
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's the 2nd language. I surely write some wrong or even stupid stuff as well
 miszu: I want to an english college to learn english properly. Man I struggled because you need to pass an english "exit exam" which is like an 2k word essay about ideas from the author
 miszu: went*
 karandeeppotato: :grin:
 jacek: huh? i thought there was english in canada
 miszu: if you live in Quebec it's a bit complicated
 miszu: they don't like English much
 jacek: who likes them :v
 chungangli: Hello, everybody, who can help me?
 chungangli: I want to change the account email, but I can't do it.
 chungangli: I am using gmail for this account, but I want to use outlook email for it. but I have no way to do it.
 DomiKo: miszu I used it for some tasks, and it was pretty good, BUT it really depends 
 miszu: DomiKo do you have a good reference that explains the algo clearly? All I can find is very mathy equations and I can't make sense of it
 miszu: I understand the high level but all the sigma etc. assumes that the reader knows exactly what it means
 DomiKo: algo isn't really easy, so I don't know if you can find any explanation without math
 miszu: at least they explain the pseudo code the operation
 miszu: if not I will continue to search
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://blog.otoro.net/2017/10/29/visual-evolution-strategies/">https://blog.otoro.net/2017/10/29/visual-evolution-strategies/</a>
 DomiKo: there you can find some visual effects
 DomiKo: that could help
 chungangli: Dear DomiKo, could you help me?
 DomiKo: about mail change?
 chungangli: yes
 miszu: thanks DomiKo
 DomiKo: right corner, there is a arrow, click it, then go to settings
 DomiKo: and in setting in "Login information" you can change email
 StarsAreFire: For the <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/aneo">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/aneo</a>Is the distance stated - An integer distance representing the distance of the traffic light from the starting point (in meters).From the very start of the drive or from when you enter the zone?
 chungangli: I tried, but it is needed to enter password, but I have no password becasue I am using google login now.
 Uljahn: those are the same i guess
 Uljahn: StarsAreFire
 DomiKo: if you are using google login, you need to get a password
 TheBlueBias: chungangli use the "forgot password" option to set a proper password, then you'll be able to change your email
 DomiKo: do what TheBlueBias  told you
 LeeDeffo: i have no idea what im doing right now 
 TheBlueBias: Well. I have no idea of what you're doing right now, if that rassures you.
 chungangli: Thank you, friends, it works well.&#160;:)
 DomiKo: nice
 TheBlueBias: :tada:
 TimothyAlexisVass: Sometimes when people reverse their thinking, they move sideways without looking at the backside underneath their own position.
 jacek: ~paulo coelho
 miszu: DomiKo lol in the page: "CMA-ES is my algorithm of choice when the search space is less than a thousand parameters. I found it still usable up to ~ 10K parameters if I’m willing to be patient." cvz: *laughs with the billions of search space*
 Uljahn: paramters not states
 HalfTangible: We're supposed to share our code, right?
 Uljahn: no, this is optional
 miszu: my bad
 miszu: is it possible that CMAES gets stuck in a local optimum given enough time?
 DomiKo: enough time is a weird sentence
 miszu: enough generations
 DomiKo: I'm not 100% sure, but I would say yes. 
 DomiKo: but with big enough population, it would be really rare
 miszu: I will try to give a shot with cvz. At least the simple one not with the integrals and all stuff
 jacek: :scream:
 miszu: all I need to figure out is how to generate random points from gaussian distribution and how to apply when you want to make a series of moves
 miszu: linking mean and std with many moves ahead
 miszu: TIME TO CODE CMA-ES!
 TheBlueBias: Don't scream.
 jacek: madness
 TheBlueBias: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwIe_sjKeAY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwIe_sjKeAY</a>
 miszu: jacek you think it's overkill to use that algo?
 miszu: glad c++ has a normal_distribution class in std. One problem less
 jacek: its alright
 TheBlueBias: don't think twice
 jacek: but cma-es sounds similar to madness
 darkhorse64: Since people started encoding NN brains in UTF16 for CG, sky is the limit, miszu. (100k too)
 miszu: cmaes is not so bad. It's just computing a normal distribution over X% best sample
 darkhorse64: :popcorn:
 El_Nino619: kys
 nikogabro: hello can anyone tell me whats catch in codingame sponsored contest??
 TheBlueBias: No. All the interest is to figure it out by yourself.
 nikogabro: okay whats your best?
 Andrew_Clark: I think I did well
 nikogabro: like how much?
 Andrew_Clark: 2:07
 nikogabro: 207?
 Andrew_Clark: the time I took
 TheBlueBias: You're not speaking of the same thing...
 Andrew_Clark: oh
 nikogabro: xd
 jacek: oO
 miszu: if my parameters are x and y  but I simulate 10 moves ahead does that mean I have 20 parameters?
 Uljahn: i think yes
 Wontonimo: are you talking about a GA miszu&#160;?
 Wontonimo: if so, that is how some people implement a GA
 Wontonimo: an implementation detail is that on the next game round, you move all the parameters 1 position.
 Wontonimo: also, some simulations work better by keeping dx and dy instead of x and y
 Uljahn: also you can use complex numbers :smirk:
 Wontonimo: oh?  tell me more about that
 Uljahn: i mean one complex number instead of (x, y) pair
 miszu: Wontonimo talking about CMAES
 miszu: just understanding the math
 miszu: I use dx and dy
 miszu: I understahnd you compute mean and sigma for each parameter but I don't get it how the sigma(xy) comes into place
 Wontonimo: what is CMAES?
 Uljahn:  CMA-ES
 Uljahn: evolution strategy
 Wontonimo: oh, cool.  i just learnt something.  Thanks
 ZarthaxX: guys any recommendation on a cpu?
 ZarthaxX: like intel or amd for instance, or a specific model
 miszu: amd ryzen are good
 miszu: the newest generation\
 ipsissimus: ^
 ipsissimus: note however, that if you get an amd cpu, youll need a gpu as well, as most amd chips dont have integrated basic graphics like intel
 ipsissimus: unless thats changed recently
 ipsissimus: *shrug
 ZarthaxX: no problem about that
 struct: price range ZarthaxX?
 jacek: integrated gpu is crap
 ZarthaxX: have a gpu, just wanted to know what cpu is good for programming purposes and i guess a bit of gaming
 ZarthaxX: struct ehhh hard to tell with the coin conversion hehe
 ZarthaxX: i was looking at i7 11gen for exmaple that is 330$
 ZarthaxX: accesible here
 ipsissimus: no more than a 4 core id say. no need to go crazy with threadripper or anything if you not trying to do some blender rendering etc
 ZarthaxX: okey
 jacek: but if you ml stuff, the more cores the merrier
 ipsissimus: yeah
 ZarthaxX: that's something i was worried about
 ZarthaxX: if i plan to do data science stuff
 ZarthaxX: ML etc
 ZarthaxX: would be nice to have 8 cores 16 threads?
 ipsissimus: sure, if youre looking for max cores though, i think amd is best bang for buck at the moment
 jacek: thats why i have amd. 16 threads
 ipsissimus: intel been slacking for like 5 years now
 struct: the 11700k has avx512
 ipsissimus: thats a over clockable chip i believe
 struct: you can even go for the kf
 struct: which doesnt have the integrated gpu
 ipsissimus: yeah dont pay for stuff you dont need
 ZarthaxX: well in argentina the version without F is cheaper than the one with F haha
 ZarthaxX: but as you are saying, intel has been kind of bad in last few years, but i didnt know if the i7 11gen was different
 ZarthaxX: or the i7 10gen
 ipsissimus: i have a great basic system ryzen 3600X and rx 580. does the job and gives me 1080p 60fps which im happy with.
 struct: I think the 11th gen is fine
 ipsissimus: was around 800 bucks total build
 ZarthaxX: avx512 thingy is interesting but i think useless struct haha
 ZarthaxX: tempting tho&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: nice ipsissimus
 struct: Whats the 10850k / kf price there?
 struct: its 10th gen though
 struct: but 10 cores
 ZarthaxX: an equal option in terms of money for i7 11 gen was the ryzen 7 3700x
 ipsissimus: hyperthreaded?
 ZarthaxX: mmm lemme checj
 struct: yes ipsissimus
 ipsissimus: i think x variants of ryzen chips are worth it for your use cases
 ipsissimus: ryzen just so good for an chip class
 ipsissimus: amd went hamm
 struct: it depends on the country you live in mostly
 ZarthaxX: i9 10850k is like 1/5 more than the i7 11700
 struct: On some countries theres barely any difference in price
 struct: ah ok
 ZarthaxX: ipsissimus you think so? okey..
 ipsissimus: ye but in US i think intel overpriced
 ZarthaxX: i have seen reviews everywhere recommending amd tbh
 ZarthaxX: but i didnt know if anything changed now with this 11gen
 ipsissimus: or maybe ryzen underpriced idk
 ZarthaxX: ryzen here seems to be above intel in terms of price now
 struct: yeap thats what I mean
 ipsissimus: ye that demand for a superior product :O
 ZarthaxX: ryzen 7 3700x is equal in price to i7 11700, has same cores and threads
 ipsissimus: but i think nows a bad time for chip buying no?
 struct: but 2nd gen 
 ipsissimus: what with semiconductor shortage
 ipsissimus:&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: according to this page tho i7 11gen is better <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11700-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/m1450761vs4043">https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11700-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/m1450761vs4043</a>
 struct: also new cpus coming soon I think
 ZarthaxX: but that page says the i7 11gen is better and later on every page says ryzen is better
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 miszu: ryzen 5900 is very powerful
 struct: I doubt the 2nd gen ryzen is better than the intel 11th
 miszu: that's the one I will buy once I have an rtx
 struct: Maybe in some scenarios
 ZarthaxX: uh the 5900 one seems very expensive :8
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ipsissimus: yeah intel chips arent bad we should be clear. just USUALLY more expensive. and sometimes expensive enough that you can get a better chip from amd for less
 ZarthaxX: struct its hard to tell without testing it :sweat:
 ZarthaxX: right
 ipsissimus: doesnt intel have ARC for benchmark testing?
 ZarthaxX: it makes me doubt as i have seen that every page recommends amd because its better at multicore
 ZarthaxX: so i dont know if even having 2 cpus with same cores and threads, and a benchmark saying intel one is better, i still shouldnt believe it haha
 Babali: Bonjour
 MmODeadlySins: Bonjour&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: hey
 MmODeadlySins: You'are Welcome  :)
 ipsissimus: i dont think you can go wrong with ryzen at the moment. unless next gen comes out with crazy new tech
 ZarthaxX: okey
 struct: hi
 TheBlueBias: :french_bread:
 ipsissimus: but it may not work out price wise dependent on location
 Babali: @MmoDeadlySins ça va gro&#160;?
 Astrobytes: #fr guys
 TheBlueBias: Baguette
 ZarthaxX: ipsissimus thing is i have these 2 cpus at same price, and i didnt know what to pick
 ipsissimus: which 2?
 ZarthaxX: i mean these <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11700-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/m1450761vs4043">https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-11700-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/m1450761vs4043</a>
 Babali: Berret
 MmODeadlySins: @babali lol
 WisTala: English here thanks
 ZarthaxX: and the i7 10700 is a 1/5 cheaper option too for those, dont know if worth
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-10700-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4077vs4043">https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-10700-vs-AMD-Ryzen-7-3700X/4077vs4043</a>
 ipsissimus: ryzen 15$ cheaper
 ipsissimus: ez choice&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: ignore that
 ZarthaxX: here is same price
 ZarthaxX: i just wanted to show models and benchmarks, not prices as they dont make any sense when talking in different countries :P
 struct: ah here the 3700x is way cheaper
 struct: 270 vs 320
 ZarthaxX: damn&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: maybe they are equal here because people is buying ryzen mostly
 ipsissimus: well that says something too no?
 ZarthaxX: what thing?
 ipsissimus: that everyone buying them up and its driving up the price
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ipsissimus: and its not like amd spamming marketing like intel does
 ZarthaxX: yeah its true
 ZarthaxX: well in the benchmark page, the amount of benchmarks for ryzen one is huge
 ipsissimus: really though, disappointed in intel. they need to step it up. Competition is good for consumers
 ZarthaxX: like 10x and more times intel one
 ZarthaxX: yeah&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: so, ryzen option is good for programming too?
 ZarthaxX: i just dont know how much multicore benefits here
 ipsissimus: yeah like I said, ryzen is just a sick with the (zen??) architecture
 ZarthaxX: aight
 ipsissimus: they really went hamm on this product skew i think
 ipsissimus: seen alot of true believers come out because of ryzen
 ZarthaxX: good to know
 ipsissimus: yeah most people dont know but the only reason amd was in the game with intel owning like 80% market share in the past was that amd had the 64 bit architecture patent, and they licensed it to intel. but with recent products, their market share has soared
 ipsissimus: take a look and see for yourself
 ZarthaxX: oh nice, will check it out ty&#160;:)
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hexus.net/business/news/components/147224-amd-briefly-passes-intel-desktop-cpu-market-share/">https://hexus.net/business/news/components/147224-amd-briefly-passes-intel-desktop-cpu-market-share/</a>
 ZarthaxX: annoying to be in this moment of the year where there is a 50 50 tho haha
 ZarthaxX: and with these 11 gen from intel that dont have much time on the market to have a clear judge about them
 ipsissimus: yeah but both manufacturers going to have a hard time with supply. so prices going to get raised 
 ipsissimus: prophecy detected
 ZarthaxX: probably haha
 struct: I dont know how well 12th gen will do
 struct: with multiple diferent cores
 struct: like 16 cores but 24 threads
 struct: only 8 cores have 2 threads
 ipsissimus: likely will be OS dependent i think right? some OSs handle core abstraction better than others
 struct: no idea
 ipsissimus: i have the other extreme than zarthaxx, i like to do small projects on toasters. really makes you figure out how to be efficient
 jacek: like how to fit NN in 100k limit
 ipsissimus: ye. tho im trash at programming, i know hardware better cuz im EE. but thats why im here&#160;:) to get trashed by my competition and look at their code
 TheBlueBias: Toasters are less expensive though.
 ipsissimus: thats right. and if you can get it to work on a potato. itll work beautifully on company high end employee issued comps
 matez: The clash of code page sometimes does not work:when the clash would start it does not give the coding page and you cannot do anything just became the last player&#160;:(
 TheBlueBias: Just refresh the page and you'll get the IDE

 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: if you do, it would be a perfect score

 struct: Because I could not take the best path

 eulerscheZahl: it's about how many valid paths you can create

 derzinek: Hello guys. I'm new here and I need some help. Trying to solve chuck norris. Can't pass third test. ASCII for&#160;% char is 37 and binary for 37 is 100101. When I encode it result is: 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0. My code works correctly but the test says it's  00 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0. Why?
 struct: Needs to be 7 bit binary
 struct: so 100101
 struct: would become 0100101
 derzinek: I think I missed that part. Thank you so much struct.
 struct: it needs leading 0's
 struct: np
 struct: leading or trailing
 struct: i cant remember the right word
 derzinek: "i cant remember the right word" never mind, I'm not so good at English&#160;:))

 2ReGul4r: Hey can someone explain me how I can approve contributions? I got 50+ games of clash of code, but I still cant do it&#160;:(
 jacek: shouldnt it be more?
 2ReGul4r: it says: Any player who has played more than 50 clashes has approver rights.
 jacek: so you have 50 or 51 games played
 2ReGul4r: i got 51
 jacek: maybe it takes time to acknowledge, i.e. the ranking calculation is done once per day
 struct: search racer jacek?
 2ReGul4r: yeah thats the only tought I had why it would work
 jacek: struct eeyup
 jacek: i though id try nn there before trying in csb
 struct: nice
 struct: how many different moves do you allow?
 jacek: for GA every move
 jacek: -18..18 and 0..200
 struct: but this wont be for the NN right?
 struct: wont be the same
 struct: 
 Westicles: only 49 clashes
 Westicles: you have to look on the leaderboard
 jacek: yeah, id probably quantify for starters
 jacek: at first im gonna do supervised based on moves from GA
 Astrobytes: Quantize you mean?
 jacek: quack
 ja_fica: I'm having an hard time to convert an array of 128*128 float values to fit in 100k size code
 Astrobytes: I was asking seriously
 struct: ja_fica do you use 32 bit float?
 ja_fica: I do, but I can discard the last 16 bits
 ja_fica: and the remaining of the mantissa
 ja_fica: *and keep
 struct: if its 16 you can use special chars
 struct: I think
 struct: the cg editor counts chars not bytes
 struct: so you can use 4 bytes chars
 MSmits: some chars are counted as 2 chars.
 ja_fica: the problem is that \0 and \n characters exist
 MSmits: (or something)
 MSmits: ja_fica let me check how i do it.
 struct: I never did this before so I dont really know the details
 ja_fica: im having trouble in \0 and \n
 MSmits: ja_fica I skip a few characters
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/233c8046-51fc-4c1c-91b6-feb96730ec86">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/233c8046-51fc-4c1c-91b6-feb96730ec86</a>
 MSmits: I start at 'a' + 95 to skip most of the control characters
 MSmits: and then there are 2 more of those in the 8k range, i also skip
 MSmits: stay below 50k or so and you should be safe
 MSmits: I only use 14 bit from a unicode character myself, but 15 bit should be safe
 MSmits: it's just a bit annoying decoding it, because you have to be careful about how to do the -2 for results higher than 8232
 jacek: welp i use 1 weight - 1 character
 MSmits: yeah but how do you avoid those control characters?
 MSmits: have you just been lucky not hitting them accidentally?
 jacek: lower resolution
 MSmits: dont know what that means
 jacek: + its somewhat homemade ugly solution
 MSmits: ok so you skip the bad characters?
 MSmits: like this one:
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c757cb95-b960-477c-b57e-7e3c79517ac7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c757cb95-b960-477c-b57e-7e3c79517ac7</a>
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codetable.net/decimal/8232">https://www.codetable.net/decimal/8232</a>
 MSmits: mmh not sure i understand that completely, but are you just skipping way more characters than you need to?
 jacek: probably. here the 'resolution' is 1/3000.0, enough for most purposes
 MSmits: yeah but i am not worried about the accuracy of it
 MSmits: i am worried about it converting to unicode 8232 which is a line separator
 MSmits: thats what ja_fica was talking about
 ja_fica: Too complex for me to get it right was
 ja_fica: *way
 jacek: unicode 8232?
 MSmits: ja_fica it's not too hard, if you start at a + 95 and skip 8232 and 8233
 jacek: i just care it will not exceed 50000 something
 MSmits: this one jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codetable.net/decimal/8232">https://www.codetable.net/decimal/8232</a>
 MSmits: it makes your string go to the next line when you paste it
 ja_fica: yes
 jacek: i never encountered it then
 MSmits: i only did recently
 MSmits: (my book got big)
 jacek: and the visualiser is done somewhat :tada: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/37v53b">https://streamable.com/37v53b</a>
 MSmits: that looks cool
 ja_fica: MSmits, with your code, I cant print the characters
 ja_fica: they get implicit converted to %255
 MSmits: no, the function is bigger, but it's C# code, so i dont know if it'll help you
 MSmits: this is just the part that skips the bad unicode chars
 MSmits: also i dont do floats (yet)
 ja_fica: I can do C# as well
 MSmits: ok i'll share the code, but its complicated
 ja_fica: Well Im not worried about floats
 ja_fica: I can use union to integer
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ff1a15c-a645-42be-b495-5d98e582d263">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9ff1a15c-a645-42be-b495-5d98e582d263</a>
 ja_fica: thanks, I'm having this problem at a long time ago
 MSmits: I use 6 bits per yavalath move
 MSmits: since a character holds 14 bits, the moves are sort of split between different unicode chars
 MSmits: the bitindex is where in the current number I am at
 MSmits: and the bitnumber is the number for that character
 MSmits: this will eventually become a unicode char
 ja_fica: thats genius
 ja_fica: Thats exacly what I tried to do
 MSmits: thanks, i use different systems for different games
 MSmits: in bandas i put 10 moves in 1 char =)
 MSmits: 10 solved states i mean
 ja_fica: but can't we make 14 bits of info into a single char?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: so a solved state is like 1.5 bits&#160;:)
 MSmits: W/L/D
 MSmits: thats less than 2  bits
 MSmits: I do a ternary representation here
 MSmits: 3^10 fits in 1 unicode char
 MSmits: so you can fit 10 WLDs in 1 char
 MSmits: but for Yavalath it's just 2 moves and a little extra, because it's an  opening book
 ja_fica: Im a litle confused how to use it for 14 bits but I'm definitely use C#, thanks a lot
 MSmits: it's easy. First move fits in bit 0-5 of first char, Second move fits in 6-11 of first char, Third move fits in 12-13 of first char and 0-3 of second
 MSmits: thats if you use 14 bit, but i could have used 15
 MSmits: it's just messy to code, you're going to make bugs. But the concept is easy
 MSmits: that list of integers i feed in, all has integers that fit in 6 bits ofc (yavalath has 61 hexes)
 Chrisidris21: first time learning lua
 Chrisidris21: code
 struct: I see that you got 1st again
 struct: nice
 MSmits: Thanks, I remade the book, it's much bigger now
 MSmits: and the bot is new too
 MSmits: better TT and pruning
 struct: you are doing c4 atm right?
 ja_fica: I finnaly got around flatten neural network weigths. Thats my final step to copy weigths. Then all that I'm missing is the training process. Alpha-zero like code its hard to transpose to C++
 MSmits: remaking C4 with the same kind of TT. Locally will redo also for meta mcts, I have a great idea for pruning. Maybe i can solve C4 with that
 jacek: solve nine men morris
 ja_fica: 6x7 is solved in 5seconds
 MSmits: I was thinking about the fact that we use only 3 possible options out of 4 with our bitboard representation: Namely empty, p1 played or p2 played. There's not an option for occupying both p1 and p2 bitboards
 ja_fica: you can use transposition table with 72 bits 
 MSmits: so what if I use that for representing  parts of the board that can no longer affect the outcome?
 MSmits: like cells that can no longer make 4 in a row
 MSmits: it does not matter if they are blue or red
 ja_fica: static already played positions?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i can make many many transpositions with that
 MSmits: reducing the statespace by a lot
 MSmits: so when creating a new state locally, I check the whole board, all useless cells are coloured as this other color
 ja_fica: thats happens if you go full minimax
 ja_fica: and not MCTS
 MSmits: and represented by both p1 and p2 filled
 MSmits: this is just for local meta mcts though
 MSmits: it will be too slow otherwise
 MSmits: drawn or nearly drawn games only solve around 17 or 18 plies before the end. I think i can solve these much sooner with this TT trick
 MSmits: or at least re-using the results much more
 MSmits: btw, i am not interested in using this to retain/regain nr 1 C4. I could just do that by making a bigger book. I like a shot at solving it
 struct: I think ill code my mcts to change the value of the node instead of having the status var to check if its solved
 struct: Just to try the avx select again
 wizaral: Hello. How to reopen school/job chat if I've closed it?
 MSmits: ohh right, i'd be interested to see if you can make it work struct
 MSmits: no idea wizaral
 struct: i have a version but it doesnt perform better
 MSmits: yeah i know, i meant if you make it work better
 struct: mainly due to the fact that I need to do some weird stuff to the status var
 wizaral: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: struct you could try it with a game that has no draws
 struct: wizaral was it a chatroom?
 MSmits: then you can avoid status altogether
 MSmits: (just set extreme negative wins or positive wins for solved games)
 struct: I still think it wont do much of a difference
 wizaral: I used join command and it reopened
 MSmits: probably not, but that won't stop you
 struct: true, ill try to do something on ICPC first though
 MSmits: gz wizaral&#160;:)
 MSmits: what is this ICPC
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1576/problem/A">https://codeforces.com/contest/1576/problem/A</a>
 MSmits: ohh ok, looks cool
 MSmits: jacek i was going to solve nine men's morris at some point. Is it up yet?
 jacek: its in contributions
 MSmits: yeah i know, been there for a long time
 struct: I tried playing it vs ludii
 MSmits: it's solvable, but requires some trickery
 struct: it started smiling at me before I placed all the pieces
 struct:&#160;:/
 MSmits: haha
 MSmits: it's exactly the kind of game i like to try and solve so I hope it gets out of contribution soon. 
 MSmits: you can't fit the whole solved result in a bot as a book, so it's not like you can use it very well ingame
 MSmits: but it would be cool to try and train a NN on the solved results
 Astrobytes: weren't you going to approve 9mm jacek?
 Astrobytes: it only needs one more since eric approved earlier
 <b>**Astrobytes killed the chat</b></p><p><img src="/a/71042767029501" /> TheBlueBias: With a 9mm...
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: that was 9 Mens Morris btw in case anyone didn't catch that
 MSmits: naw, we just assumed jacek visits people who submit solved games with a 9mm
 MSmits: that jacek, always trolling people
 Astrobytes: Hey, Poland isn't *that* wild lol
 MSmits: I'm sure Russians think it's the wild west
 Astrobytes: I'm not convinced
 MSmits: they have wild west themeparks at least :P
 Astrobytes: lol, I don't want to know :D
 Astrobytes: The image conjured up in the mind upon thinking of that is quite enough
 MSmits: hehe ok
 Astrobytes: MSmits: Why did Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac and Wolfgang Pauli work in very small garages?
 Astrobytes: They were quantum mechanics!
 Astrobytes: (before you look it up)
 MSmits: oh nice one&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: A blowfly goes into a bar and asks: "Is that stool taken?"
 Astrobytes: (blowfly larvae eat sht)
 Astrobytes: Done for today, I'm here all week
 MSmits: lol
 wegrepdf: hi
 Astrobytes: lo
 Astrobytes: No no, this version has "William Tell has stretched his bow till it won't stretch No furthermore and/or it may require a change that hasn't come before." after a few rearranged lyrics.I mean they forgot shit all the time lol
 Astrobytes: ahhh ffs
 Astrobytes: So wish there was a remove message button
 Astrobytes: (wrong tab, please ignore the above)
 miszu: man get sample from multivariate gaussian is so complicated
 Astrobytes: hahaha, fun with stats
 miszu: I thought you can plug and play but NOOOO... you have to find a matric A such that A*A^t = Sigma
 Astrobytes: It's not a straightforward algorithm
 Astrobytes: I mean, I haven't used it, but I've checked it out (the maths at least) and I would make sure you understand the maths first before attempting the algorithm itself
 Astrobytes: Are you sure this is a good idea for CvZ?
 miszu: cvz would work in theory
 miszu: because cma es is good for problems that the reward is much later
 miszu: such as cvz
 miszu: there are scenarios where you score big points just at the end
 Astrobytes: Hm, I get your reasoning
 Astrobytes: And good luck with it! Nice placement with the GA btw, you don't just want to fine tune that for a better score?
 miszu: I did flat MC
 Astrobytes: Aha!
 Astrobytes: Told you it was decent
 MSmits: Sent you a reply miszu. Going to sleep now
 MSmits: gn all&#160;!
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits
 miszu: gn MSmits
 miszu: I did flat MC before but I did a mistake
 miszu: I chose number between -1000 to 1000
 miszu: however rarely you get 1000
 miszu: so I fixed thanks to struct and increased to like 2000 so like 50% chance you get 1000
 Astrobytes: that's what I meant before about ranges
 Astrobytes: Have a higher+lower range than you need and clamp the result to your legal range
 Astrobytes: well, not clamp, but take the appropriate value
 Astrobytes: You won't go back to trying your RHEA?
 miszu: I was too stupid to understand what you meant before :P
 miszu: RHEA?
 miszu: what's that?
 Astrobytes: lolAh, rolling horizon evolutionary algorithm
 Astrobytes: The GA type you were using previously
 Astrobytes: GA/EA
 miszu: GA I tried but gave me suboptimal results
 miszu: but maybe I implemented wrongly
 miszu: the crossover part
 Astrobytes: That's in its nature but it should be better than flat MC
 miszu: I simply took the delta X and delta Y from different parents
 Astrobytes: this is a conversation for later for me I'm afraid, I'm going to bed. I think it's worth giving it a go again
 miszu: i will
 miszu: thanks!
 miszu: but need some research about crossover
 Astrobytes: there's a lot of different ways, start simple and experiment
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out, see ya later&#160;:)
 miszu: take care!
 Thorcode: hi
 Wontonimo: hello all
 khalis: hi
 Wontonimo: hey khalis
 Wontonimo: what brings you here?
 Wontonimo: not much eh?
 Hyperplane: wtw&#160;;]
 Wontonimo: hey Hyperplane
 Wontonimo: what are you working on?
 Westicles: mom called them both to take out the garbage
 Wontonimo: it happens
 OofButBetter: hello. i am new to this website!
 Wontonimo: hey
 Wontonimo: how did you find out about it?
 Mauprogamer333: can you recommend me a book of algorithms?
 OofButBetter: my tutor showed me it
 Wontonimo: oh.  what have you seen so far?
 OofButBetter: only a couple of taks, but i am having lots of fun!
 Wontonimo: there is this python cookbook <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf">http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Python-Cookbook-3rd-Edition.pdf</a>
 OofButBetter: *tasks
 Wontonimo: what programming language are you interested in
 OofButBetter: python
 Wontonimo: oh, that link i just sent could be good
 OofButBetter: i also write in c++, but mostly python
 Wontonimo: and also there is this site to practice some easier puzzles in python <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 Wontonimo: once you have the basics like loops, arrays, functions then try some of the puzzles here
 Westicles: after you do 50 clashes you can approve my cryptic reverse contribs
 Wontonimo: no no plz don't
 Wontonimo: oh, i read that wrong
 Wontonimo: i thought you said "approve any cryptic reverse contribs"
 Wontonimo: please do approve Westicles' reverse contribs
 Westicles: heh heh, well no you had it right at first.  I watched twitch and they mostly hate them
 Wontonimo: my secret is that i don't watch twitch, so I don't know how much people hate my contribs
 Westicles: binarysearch seems to be the big thing these days
 Wontonimo: what kinds of things have you done with python and c++ so far OofButBetter
 OofButBetter: uhh i programmed on those languages and learend to use them but nothing else really
 Wontonimo: this is one of the 'intro' puzzles here.  check it out and tell me how you do <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 Wontonimo: you can pick any programming language you like from the dropdown at the top
 OofButBetter: i already did that
 Wontonimo: and how did you find it? difficult, easy&#160;?
 OofButBetter: pretty easy
 OofButBetter: im on temparature right now
 Wontonimo: okay, i made this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine</a>  How hard is it?
 Wontonimo: okay, do temperatures
 Wontonimo: you get more points for it i think
 OofButBetter: ill do it after:)
 Wontonimo: do you have a math background or physics?  If so I can recommend some that have more of a math or physics style to them
 OofButBetter:    no not really im fine for now
 Wontonimo: :thumbsup:
 OofButBetter: :ok_hand:
 Wontonimo: Westicles, are you working on anything these days?
 Wontonimo: when you say binary search is the big thing, on the twitch stream?  It's that ... kinda old school&#160;?
 Westicles: I hadn't heard of it before.  Seems to be about learning algorithms
 Wontonimo: binary search learning algorithms?  like a decision tree?
 Westicles: oh,  I meant <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://binarysearch.com/">https://binarysearch.com/</a>
 OofButBetter: well i set up my profile pic
 Wontonimo: you are mentally unstable
 Wontonimo: (tm)
 OofButBetter: :joy:
 Thorcode: is there any 13 years old boy from US or UK
 Thorcode: pls dm me&#160;:)
 Thorcode: I need something to prepare for SAT
 Thorcode: I need more English word in more subject&#160;:)
 Westicles: they've dumbed down the SAT so much in recent years that almost everyone aces it
 Wontonimo: participation badge
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Westicles: back in the old days a 1600 meant you got on TV and invited to space camp
 Wontonimo: noone watches TV anymore
 Wontonimo: so you wouldn't know even if that still happened
 Thorcode: or read news
 Westicles: people read news 18 hours a day now
 Wontonimo: which people?  Fox news doesn't count
 Westicles: twitter and whatnot
 Thorcode: I can solve SAT if I have more word even the SAT is DUMBED down I can't do it if I don't understand the input&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: what words are you looking to learn?
 Westicles: Just concentrate on writing a nice essay about the important of climate change
 Thorcode: the math word
 Thorcode: like sum plus minus, etc
 Westicles: :thinking:
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/</a> has some great word problems
 Wontonimo: that are focused on math
 Thorcode: thanks
 Thorcode: I can write an essay
 Thorcode: Thanks Wontinomo
 Wontonimo: let me know if that helps
 Wontonimo: you are welcome
 Westicles: I always get suspicious when the chat log is missing a day.  Something big must have gone down yesterday
 Wontonimo: :thinking:
 Thorcode: Yesterday my chat broken&#160;:(
 Thorcode: can't connect to the server&#160;:&lt;
 C26_1: if stockPrice() &gt; stockPrice(1)

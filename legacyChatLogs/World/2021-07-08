 Arthur_Phantasm: hey yall, would it be possible to make a online multiplayer game here?
 Arthur_Phantasm: or, atleast learn how to make one?
 derjack: online multiplayer? no. there are multis for bots only
 Arthur_Phantasm: sad
 Astrobytes: the 'game' in 'codingame' does not imply game development. This is not a game development website.
 derjack:&#160;:(

 Docer: teach me too code
 masknksnvsndvo: what is the shortest way of taking int input from the same line for 2 variables
 masknksnvsndvo: in python
 masknksnvsndvo: Because I'm currently using map
 masknksnvsndvo: but it's still lengthy
 KiwiTae: input returns a string in python sorry 
 Shozy: im also writing lst = map(int, input.split(" ")) 
 KiwiTae: map(int,input.split()) 
 KiwiTae: and map is not a list
 AllYourTrees: a,b=map(int,input.split())
 Shozy: ye, I forgot about list before sry
 zmx: hello
 zmx: It's really difficult to python
 KiwiTae: zmx nop
 zmx: teach me too code
 Wontonimo: no problem zmx, here is a link you could check out www.google.com
 Wontonimo: I've found lots of programming tutorials there
 zmx: cool
 Wontonimo: np dude
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: but more seriously, what lang have you tried?
 Wontonimo: hi struct :wave:
 zmx: 我不知道
 Wontonimo: Fancy, but i'm not familiar with that programming lang
 zmx: np  dude
 Wontonimo: you've been coding Python right?
 Wontonimo: :eyes:
 derjack: thats opening book?
 zmx: yeah
 struct: more books on c4 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: good thing i only wasted a few hours on that game
 derjack: therefore this is c4 library
 Wontonimo: have you tried any of the practice puzzles zmx&#160;?
 derjack: hows the bt
 struct: slow progress
 struct: Maybe ill do amazons instead
 struct: at least i wont struggle vs books
 derjack: no books in bt
 derjack: but some challenge in amazons would be welcome
 struct: maybe i need to add a covert art to it
 Astrobytes: So nobody can see it?
 Astrobytes: (covert :P )
 zmx: I tried   Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: cool, good job on doing some
 zmx: teach me too code
 zmx: ok
 Wontonimo: arn't you going to get on the book bandwagon struct?
 struct: no
 Wontonimo: take your time, you don't have to answer right away.  i know it can take some introspection
 struct: not really
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: lol
 struct: I have strong opinion on it
 Wontonimo: go for it, I'm sitting down
 struct: im not against it, but its not really something that i would do
 struct: lets keep it at that
 Wontonimo: allergies.  Yeah, I have a similar reaction to PHP
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 Im9: hi
 Illedan: hi

 Astrobytes: hi Illedan
 Wontonimo: i'm just thrown words around
 Illedan: Zup astro? You joined the NN wave?
 Astrobytes: Not yet lol
 Astrobytes: Gonna have to it seems&#160;:)
 Illedan: Indeed
 Illedan: Just need a whole lot more time :D 
 Astrobytes: For sure!
 derjack: cpu/gpu time?
 struct: need summer to end first
 Illedan: cpu/gpu/irl/spare/life/free time
 Illedan: 4p games in blocking is so random -.-
 struct: amazons is all you need
 Illedan: Is that another game?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: yep
 Illedan: hm
 struct: unbookable
 Astrobytes: A good one at that
 struct: NNable
 Illedan: Guess I've been far less active for a long time
 Astrobytes: You *do* have a good excuse&#160;;)
 zmx: i won't
 Illedan: Shh
 Illedan: ahhhhh
 Illedan: so many board games
 Illedan: -.-
 struct: this one is different&#160;:(
 struct: but i understand what you are saying
 Illedan: This is just WW with less steps?
 Astrobytes: Noooo
 derjack: WW?
 Illedan: Range on placing walls is infinite?
 struct: range is infinite yes
 Illedan: Top players doing NN?
 struct: also you can move any range
 struct: jacek has NN
 derjack: no NNs yet
 struct: But I dont think its his current submission
 derjack: this game is even easier than onitama
 struct: you have NN for it right&#160;?
 struct: just didnt submit
 derjack: locally
 derjack: no need to, still have 100% winrate
 struct: is it mcts?
 struct: the current one
 derjack: minimax
 derjack: simple yet powerful eval
 Astrobytes: "what is this, the 90s?"
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Illedan: How hard could this be :thinking:
 Illedan: OK, you had me at I got vacation and coffe
 Illedan: I'll give it 2 hours
 Illedan: Let's go
 struct: gl :D
 struct: hf
 Illedan: Anyone got a free eval for sale?
 Astrobytes: Nope.
 derjack: be better than opponent
 derjack: [sold]
 Illedan: Nice
 Illedan: I'll take that
 Illedan: Don't blame me when I wreck you
 struct: just wait until he sees the ammount of moves :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Illedan: Whaaat, I don't get possible moves as input?
 Illedan: :sob:
 Astrobytes: Far too many
 struct: you get number of legal moves
 derjack: over 1000
 derjack: welp heres my train
 Illedan: Always 8x8 right?
 struct: yes
 struct: only difference between games should be the starting positions
 Illedan: White always first?
 struct: yes
 struct: but you play 2 games
 struct: one has white and one has black
 Illedan: Yeah, but on swap. White is first on the next game too, yeah?
 struct: yes
 IonutS: Hello
 iliass_aek: aloha
 Illedan: struct, wouldn't the scoring on Amazons be better with number of open squares left as scoring? Feel it would often end in draws?
 struct: hard to say
 struct: if i didnt make it have 2 games there would be no draws&#160;:(
 Illedan: Sure, but 2 games is nice
 MSmits: it's better to have 2 games for balance
 MSmits: if this means you get a lot of draws then it's even better as you eliminate the luck factor in going 1st or 2nd
 MSmits: imagine uttt without 2 games, it would really suck
 MSmits: p1 would win most of the time and your success on the board would depend on how often you were p1
 struct: but i wonder if there is a difference in elo
 struct: for 2 games
 struct: and 2 games in same replay
 Illedan: Yeah, but counting the square left would give less draws
 struct: draws happen a lot in wood 2 because of random
 MSmits: what I know for sure is that your 2 games choices makes it so that the leaderboard gives a more accurate measurement
 struct: i make them play exactly same game
 MSmits: re curse did this too with chess
 MSmits: and langtons ant has it too
 Illedan: Yeah, I agree on that part
 Illedan: Just unsure about the win condition
 struct: yeah the  win condition is from the original rules 
 MSmits: it doesnt work for all games though, if you were to remove steal from yavalath and instead had 2 games, every result on the leaderboard would be a draw
 MSmits: (at least between good bots)
 MSmits: same with c4
 BiMathAx: Hi, me and y friend are blocked on the level of the TV (in come back 80s)Someone can help us plsWe have taken the indices but this still doesn't work and return a grid of 0

 MSmits: you can stream on your phone if you are blocked from TV
 MSmits: (if this is a puzzle I have never heard of it )
 BiMathAx: It's a puzzle in the coding escape 
 MSmits: ohhh ok

 Illedan: struct, I would really love some indicator on the tiles on their game color. Like a Blue/Red star or whatnot in the center to make tracking a game easier..
 Illedan: *pices
 Illedan: *pieces

 Illedan: Just a circles in the center of small width is sufficient I think&#160;:)

 Astrobytes: Boba McGinnis
 Wontonimo: what's your bot so far Illedan&#160;?
 Illedan: Just bruteforce everything and throw a Vornoi at it
 Wontonimo: I haven't used Vornoi on anything on CG yet.  Actually, don't think I've ever applied it to any computer problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: voroni works well on tron
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: Losing by 1 move some games vs trictra. Can't quit just jet
 Wontonimo: i've done simultaneous flood fill.  Are you doing it with lines?
 Illedan: Oh, true. I do floodfill on the lines and not Vornoi
 Illedan: With altering colors
 Wontonimo: colour per player, or colour per round%2&#160;?
 Illedan: Color per player with decay on the depth
 Wontonimo: that worked for me for Tron, but no decay.  Decay is an interesting twist.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "Back to the code" works too
 struct: i see the draws ammout
 struct: o.o
 struct: I guess it happens more on unbalanced positions
 Samson120: any tips on detecting a loop in a map?

 jacek: its thursday and almost no mention of this puzzle of the week
 FalINTOblivion0112: its coming out i think
 FalINTOblivion0112: later this week
 Astrobytes: isn't it coop mate with rook?
 jacek: yes, but no one mentioned it in the chat
 jacek: while previous week everyone were hyped for sokoban
 jacek: or ban
 Astrobytes: guess they're probably still doing sokoban
 Astrobytes: Or escape rooms
 jacek: oh didnt see escape rooms hype either
 jacek: maybe they escaped from the chat
 Astrobytes: discord is where the hypes at, plus you get your own chat in escapes
 punter147: cooperative mate with rook should be solved by bfs right?
 punter147: coz we need the shortest sequence of moves
 Illedan: lol jacek, that replay :D
 FalINTOblivion0112: discord gang?
 jacek: punter147 bfs is for shortest, yes
 punter147: thanks jacek, will give this puzzle a try. 
 ja_fica: MSmits, how much speed you do games in your meta MCTS solver?
 MSmits: that depends on how deep the branch is. 
 MSmits: when it is exploring nearly solved branchines, up to 100 games/s
 ja_fica: I always start from the begining
 MSmits: branches
 ja_fica: I m building my first opening book creater
 MSmits: oh cool
 MSmits: what do you mean starting from the beginning?
 ja_fica: Thats what i'm submiting
 ja_fica: Well im not doing a meta MCTS
 MSmits: oh you're just doing normal mcts with high calculation time?
 ja_fica: I'm doing MCTS on top of a AI vs AI MTCS plays
 ja_fica: No not taht
 ja_fica: Im using MTCS for each play
 MSmits: how does that work? It sounds like meta mcts to me
 ja_fica: each play is stored in TT
 ja_fica: TT also with symetry
 MSmits: sure, same as me then
 ja_fica: Its close to meta
 MSmits: but whats different
 ja_fica: I use different UCT formula
 MSmits: oh, ok
 jacek: D:
 MSmits: what is the function of the new formula?
 Illedan: Astrobytes, what are you submitting?
 MSmits: your end
 Astrobytes: Not sure Illedan, since I ran out of plays
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: So I just though fk it
 ja_fica: (obp-&gt;visits[col]==0&#160;? 0.4&#160;: (obp-&gt;score[col]+obp-&gt;visits[col])/(obp-&gt;visits[col]*2.0)) + (obp-&gt;defaultMove == col &amp;&amp; obp-&gt;totalVisits&lt;(4+plays*4)&#160;? 2.2f&#160;: 1.2f)*sqrt(clog/(obp-&gt;visits[col]+1));
 MSmits: looks complicated
 ja_fica: I want to force replays in MTCS so I can have good intermidiate books
 Astrobytes: think my earlier one was better but thanks to CG I don't know
 Illedan: Yeah, that replay cap
 Illedan: sad panda noises
 ja_fica: I tries multiple until I found one that resulted in good entries
 Illedan: Anyway, off to play cards and drink beer. Cya
 ja_fica: I only have around 65 so far
 Illedan: Need a new game tomorrow
 MSmits: 65 what?
 Astrobytes: Nice, cya later Illedan, enjoy&#160;:)
 ja_fica: 65 good entries
 MSmits: whats an entry? A move?
 ja_fica: a state
 ja_fica: state-&gt;move
 MSmits: oh, but how do you know they're good?
 MSmits: btw meta mcts, if done well, gives you good opening moves very very slowly
 ja_fica: parent &gt;= x visits &amp;&amp; (win&gt;=40% || solved &amp;&amp; WIN) 
 MSmits: do you build a meta tree?
 ja_fica: No
 ja_fica: I have an unordered_map with a good hash function
 MSmits: well i have something like that too, but I still use it as if it is a tree
 MSmits: i generate the moves and during selection i pick them out of the dictionary (hash map)
 ja_fica: In you values from your maps, you have pointer to the other states?
 MSmits: no, everything is in a dictionary, similar to your unordered map
 MSmits: the state representation is the hash key
 MSmits: so i generate children, turn all of them into keys and pick the correct nodes out of the dictionary
 MSmits: if they dont exist, i create them
 ja_fica: the hash function cannot be the same as the key
 MSmits: and select that node as a leaf to run a game from (since its new)
 ja_fica: Unless you have spent millions of dollares on memory
 MSmits: well C# handles the conversion of Guid (128 bit type) to a hash key
 MSmits: but equality is checked so it's all fine
 ja_fica: Yes, I prefer to make my hash function
 MSmits: I do in C++ as well, but this part of my meta mcts is not a bottleneck even with a really bad hash function
 ja_fica: I use the trick I told you last time, it highl reduces collisions
 MSmits: the games are run in c++ from the leafs of the dictionary (tree) in my C# windows forms program
 ja_fica: the p0 | availablemoves
 MSmits: yeah thats nice
 MSmits: i would use it if i  needed it
 ja_fica: I never understood what you mean by playing only the leaf nodes
 ja_fica: you don't store every state, I suppose
 MSmits: hmm i'll try to explain
 MSmits: ok so think of 1 overarching tree in my C# program
 MSmits: all of it is stored (currently 6 GB)
 MSmits: I start every game at the root of this
 MSmits: then i do 1 single selection downwards until i hit a leaf of this stored tree
 MSmits: so it's just 1 selection phase of mcts (which is why it can be slow)
 MSmits: at some point there's a leaf
 MSmits: a  c++ mcts selfplay program is run from this leaf
 MSmits: this runs my bot that is also on the leaderboard
 MSmits: and finishes the game
 MSmits: (can be long, or very short)
 ja_fica: how you communicate from c# to c++, I tryied so hard and couldn«t do it
 ja_fica: .NET?
 MSmits: sec yes
 ja_fica: advantages of windows
 Astrobytes: you can just run another process or you can use a dll 
 ja_fica: between c# and c++, I can only force it using nodejs as the mensager
 ja_fica: MSmits, I have a new map in 4-5 minuts
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/RCwtEJ7c">https://pastebin.com/RCwtEJ7c</a>
 ja_fica: You want to submit your bot again so we don't harm our points
 MSmits: thats most of it
 ja_fica: unfortunally it does not work outside .NET
 MSmits: start process runs once at the start of the program, once it's running it's just being used by simulation. 
 MSmits: I use 10 processes in parallel
 MSmits: thanks to mutex it's safe
 MSmits: gets a bit hot in here though :P
 ja_fica: Yes, in c++ should be easy as well
 ja_fica: Im also thinking of doing it in cuda
 MSmits: i have no experience with any of that. Windows forms was just the first thing i managed to do and i never tried anything else
 ja_fica: But is do difficult to SIMD leveraging from UCT formula
 MSmits: i never use simd in uct
 ja_fica: cuda is playing each game in a graphic thread
 ja_fica: I tried, and it was not a good idea
 MSmits: i tried also and it was also not a good idea :P
 MSmits: struct tried also
 Astrobytes: not sure anyone's had success with simd in uct, or did someone? struc t or marchet e?
 MSmits: i think struc t did have some success, but only if there was exactly the right amount of children
 Astrobytes: oh struct had false positives right
 MSmits: or just enough
 MSmits: i think so, but not 100% sure
 struct: only worth if there are exactly 8 children
 Astrobytes: something like that iirc
 MSmits: ah good, i remembered correctly then
 Astrobytes: There ya go
 struct: loading values is expensive
 struct: it might be good in games like bit runner
 struct: if you have always the same N moves
 ja_fica: AVX512 is far superior to AVX2
 ja_fica: loading is the same time and have many more instructions like popcount
 MSmits: i guess some bots may need some work if that gets onto cg cpus
 MSmits: popcount for the full register would be great
 MSmits: i wanted that for uttt
 MSmits: instead i popcount 3 times 64 bit
 ja_fica: yes, I needed that for C4
 MSmits: i union 9 miniboards with 3x 64 bit 
 MSmits: then i can quickly count the free moves
 MSmits: for c4 could be helpful as well
 AllYourTrees: huh adding draw handling to my mcts solver for C4 bumped up rating more than expected
 ja_fica: I open 4 nodes at the same time with AVX in C4
 jacek: oO
 ja_fica: I couldnt explain it if I could
 jacek: how do you handle draws differently than before
 PatrickMcGinnisII: o.q
 ja_fica: It was a weird idea
 AllYourTrees: i ignored draws before, you could only win or lose :D
 jacek: oh
 AllYourTrees: well in the mcts solver, in the game you could draw
 MSmits: they are fairly rare in actual played games, but within the search they may occur way more often
 AllYourTrees: yeah
 ja_fica: I prepare the nodess to be open without opening them, but still use the process time to predict 3 plays ahead without the memory overhead of opening nodes
 ja_fica: The better the AI's the most likely they are to draw
 MSmits: seems hard to predict 3 plays ahead
 ja_fica: And costly
 ja_fica: I only have 45k rollouts in first turn, without AVX I have 27k
 MSmits: a rollout is an expansion with 1 similation?
 AllYourTrees: are you using a NN fica?
 ja_fica: No, although im saving meta MCTS data for NN
 MSmits: oh, I guess  Icould do that too
 ja_fica: I think opening book + NN can work
 MSmits: it can, if you balance the code size properly
 ja_fica: I can buy your data
 AllYourTrees: opening book just play 4 in the center&#160;:) there you win!
 ja_fica: But for UTTT, 
 MSmits: maybe after i solve it, if i do&#160;:)
 ja_fica: I don't think it can be solved when first play it not near the center
 MSmits: ja_fica how do you store your state + move?
 MSmits: i think it can be solved, maybe not by me. Probably within 10k or so cloudcomputing time 
 ja_fica: tuple&lt;uint64_t, uint64_t, int&gt;
 MSmits: i mean, in codesize
 ja_fica: a verctor of tuples
 MSmits: how are they written
 ja_fica: Rigths now i only have 65 entries so  is something like this
 lignus: mkæas
 Astrobytes: Illedan submitting every time I submit eh :P
 lignus: they call me mister hacker man
 ja_fica: ({ {0LL, 2LL, 3}, {0LL, 1LL, 5}, {2LL, 16LL, 4}, {1LL, 8LL, 3}})
 lignus: wops sorry this is an actual chat
 Astrobytes: I'm using submit as my "Play My Code" right now
 MSmits: ja_fica so you store whole states with their moves?
 MSmits: that's very costly
 MSmits: it's cheaper to store a tree, with just the moves
 MSmits: the moves build up the state
 ja_fica: how?
 MSmits: like this:
 ja_fica: Thats really smart
 MSmits: {4{5{3}}} etc
 MSmits: a { means go deeper
 ja_fica: I use that technique in regular MCTS
 MSmits: } means go back up
 MSmits: first move is always best
 MSmits: second move is an opponent move you may have to counter
 MSmits: and third also
 MSmits: etc.
 ja_fica: thats a really good idead thanks
 MSmits: thats how i stored it before
 MSmits: but I converted to unicode thingy
 MSmits: now 1 character is 2-3 moves
 MSmits: so I can probably store around 200k
 MSmits: currently i have 26k stored
 struct: this is my book:1
 ja_fica: yes xD
 MSmits: great book, exciting till the end&#160;:)
 jacek: dont spoil the ending
 MSmits: you gotta work on the sequel
 MSmits: 7
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :popcorn:
 RoboStac: mines like structs but the 1 can randomly be a 7
 MSmits: ahh, one of those choose your own adventure randomly books
 MSmits: currently working on D&amp;B mcts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: numbers are movees :popcorn:
 struct: in d&amp;b you are safe from NNs
 ja_fica: robo why not try a neural-opening book with a bigger NN?
 MSmits: for now, i do think it's possible, but very hard to get a working NN
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ooh, movies with monsters
 MSmits: neural opening book?
 RoboStac: from what msmits has said my bot pretty much plays his book moves anyway
 RoboStac: until a fairly decent depth
 MSmits: my current version is weaker though robo, you're 1 again
 MSmits: yeah about 18 or so
 RoboStac: mm, still have 0% against you  though, just better against others
 RoboStac: I'll have to try some 8bit magic, worked well on oware
 MSmits: yeah, I guess the branches it plays vs you didnt change because it spent millions of games on other branches. I dont watch it much. I just submit and sometimes it's good, sometimes not
 ja_fica: neural-opening books can have more moves using less weigths space if you use convolution, it can be advantagous 
 ja_fica: After X detph use regular algorithm
 MSmits: i just dont see how a nn can be a book
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, Nightmare on Elmstreet
 MSmits: i mean they're mostly eval-machines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 ja_fica: Also convotions usually have better accuracy
 Marchete: 8bit magic RoboStac?
 Marchete: int8 quantization?
 RoboStac: yeah
 ja_fica: neural opening book is an imperct book
 Marchete: I was thinking about it
 Marchete: but int16
 ja_fica: *imperfect book
 Marchete: maybe I'll recheck later
 Marchete: but it's hard to do...
 RoboStac: int16 on my current bot was about 20% faster, int8 is closer to 50% faster
 MSmits: ja_fica this is like my TTT experiments, fitting a perfect minimax result to a NN. it would be like 98% accurate, but never 100
 RoboStac: you do have to retrain for int8 though unless you've capped relu
 Marchete: tensorflow like quant, or custom made?
 RoboStac: custom (similar to stockfish)
 Marchete: no, I have free relus :D
 Marchete: ahh ok
 RoboStac: the stockfish article is what made me try it, I wasn't aware of the madd instructions before
 Marchete: madd?
 Marchete: fmadd?
 BlaiseEbuth: Breaking the head of someone by hitting him violently with a dictionary, that's a neural opening book.
 RoboStac: no, not fma
 RoboStac: _mm256_madd_epi16 
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth thanks
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: technically that's a cranial opening book
 Marchete: ahh I knew it
 Marchete: mult going to 16bit, no?
 Marchete: hmm no
 RoboStac: well, you do 4 int 8's -&gt; 2 int 16's -&gt; 1 int32
 Marchete: I need to recheck
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes: Depends of how hard you hit.
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: Fair
 MSmits: last day at work tomorrow
 MSmits: well half a day
 MSmits: then 6 weeks off
 jacek: 6 weeks of more meta mcts
 MSmits: nah, i dont think i will be running it much
 MSmits: will be on vacation for a week, also it will be too hot
 MSmits: i mostly want to try get nr 1 in D&amp;B, get a oware NN working
 MSmits: maybe write that article about uttt and some other stuff
 MSmits: those 3 things are my modest goals&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: 6 weeks, nice&#160;:)
 MSmits: RoboStac, in this replay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/569124769">https://www.codingame.com/replay/569124769</a>  my meta mcts says your 2nd move is a losing move
 Astrobytes: Also, make the most of the vacation and don't CG during it&#160;:)
 MSmits: so thats frame 4
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 MSmits: i think you recover from it in most cases
 MSmits: just not vs my bot
 MSmits: Astrobytes i will CG 80% of it&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: you mean on vacation
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: no, mostly no Cg&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ALL no CG, I insist :P
 MSmits: maybe when i am bored and everyone else is sleeping
 Astrobytes: Yeah alright, I'll give you that
 BlaiseEbuth: :cry:
 RoboStac: interesting. My bot thinks 1/3/4 are very equal (all between .495 and .51) and that ones winning on policy
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/oIW6kMd">https://imgur.com/a/oIW6kMd</a>
 MSmits: so it's 66% wins from there on playing 5 for my bot
 MSmits: at least in the meta tree
 MSmits: it's really hard for any bot to get the first few moves right I guess
 MSmits: they changed for me as well even after millions of games
 MSmits: just from a strategic perspective, it would seem better to control the center
 jacek: oh there is (or will?) 2nd season of kobayashi dragon
 jacek: :3
 MSmits: aww damn, sucks jacek
 RoboStac: yeah, I think it's just struggling with the length of the line to beat that - it's convinced it'll be a draw until frame 15 when you start to get a slight advantage (.55)
 MSmits: EuroBronyCon 2021 postponed
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: that could be it
 jacek: you wanted to attend it?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/oIW6kMd">https://imgur.com/a/oIW6kMd</a>
 MSmits: chat crashed for me
 Astrobytes: yeah, came back just a min ago
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Keegangb: how are you guys training the networks
 MSmits: so... jacek, I was just sympathetic to you missing the brony conference. Personally I am not a brony&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: use a training leash and carry around treats whereever ya go :D
 Astrobytes: lol, AllYourJokes
 AllYourTrees: AllYourLaughsAreBelongToMe
 wakils: any trump supporters?
 BlaiseEbuth: I prefer guitar.
 MSmits: guitar &gt; trump
 MSmits: trump(et) 
 Astrobytes: hey trumpets are awesome
 MSmits: so are guitars
 BlaiseEbuth: Is that trump tump site already exists&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah but can you pick between Miles Davis and Django Reinhardt? (for example)
 Keegangb: no pls
 Keegangb: are you able to store permanent data during game simulation
 Astrobytes: Offline training
 Keegangb: so u literally have to remake the game
 MSmits: not visually, but yes
 Astrobytes: You have to do that for any search algo so it's not much of an issue
 Keegangb: ok yea i thought maybe that was what you guys were doing but thats so painful lmao
 Astrobytes: The source for most games is available so that helps
 Keegangb: oh thats op
 Keegangb: so like for the pod racer?
 Keegangb: cause that one seems to be the most active
 Astrobytes: Only cause it's the tutorial multi
 Keegangb: whats most active popualar then
 Astrobytes: well what do you like?
 MSmits: changes every few weeks
 Astrobytes: There are a few physics-based games like the pod racing, lots of board games, lots of grid games
 MSmits: ultimate tic tac toe comes back every 6 months or so
 Astrobytes: cause of #ru or you usually :D
 Keegangb: i mean i was really interested in physics until i found out that all the big boys just use NN, i mean i like ai but i was interested in ig "figuring out" the game
 Keegangb: or are people using NNs for pretty much all games including the min-max ones
 MSmits: thats not really true Keegangb
 Astrobytes: You can still get very high in Legend leagues without an NN, just the top spots are currently occupied in many games
 MSmits: in coders strike back it's just top 6 or so
 MSmits: and legend alone has 1000 players
 Astrobytes: *a NN
 jacek: an NN*
 jacek: i always read NN as enen
 Keegangb: true ig it could go either way
 MSmits: in boardgames it's on average 2 players with NN 
 Astrobytes: me too jacek but everyone else here hated it
 Keegangb: okay well that makes me more it=nterested
 Astrobytes: Well, Oware...
 jacek: for minimax or mcts you still need to simulate game yourself
 MSmits: i did say average 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes you can plug a NN into an existing search bot
 MSmits: so you'll need to learn those things anyway
 MSmits: NN is just the last step
 MSmits: and it's up to you if you want to take it
 Keegangb: so its doable to get top 10 in whatever game with NN tho
 Keegangb: without
 Keegangb: *
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: in csb it's possible, but very very hard with the extreme amount of players 
 MSmits: in other games it's very possible
 Keegangb: ok cool
 MSmits: many games dont even have a NN
 MSmits: on the leaderboard
 jacek: like :notebook: :soccer:
 Keegangb: are NNs prevalent in the seasonal competitions or are you like not even allowed
 Keegangb: ok thats neat
 MSmits: if you're a good coder already, try D&amp;B
 MSmits: but sure paper soccer works
 Keegangb: which is that
 MSmits: dots and boxes
 jacek: in last contest, top 1 NN dominated the leaderboard
 MSmits: it needs a lot of math which turns off most NN players
 Keegangb: ok i figured haha
 MSmits: i dont mean they dont understand the math, but they cant just plug in their nn framework into D&amp;B is why
 MSmits: takes a lot of adaptation
 jacek: d&amp;b is very mathy and more like all-or-nothing
 MSmits: yeah, like clobber 
 MSmits: though more so
 MSmits: I like it a lot
 Keegangb: i kinda want to experiment with custom models/methods for NNs so maybe i just have to join the boys
 jacek: have you read the article on cgzero
 MSmits: oware and csb are best then
 Keegangb: i havent
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game-codingame/alphazero-like-implementation-for-oware-abapa-game</a>
 MSmits: marchet e paved the way for you
 MSmits: Keegangb
 MSmits: but i would suggest you write a normal oware bot first
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: Get it working first
 Keegangb: you mean no NN?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 MSmits: yeah just mcts or minimax or whatever you like
 MSmits: get a working sim, check if it makes no mistakes
 Astrobytes: Verify your simulation etc
 MSmits: or say the same thing in 3 words
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: i will soon be out of top 10 in oware
 struct: just wait until my NN is finished
 Keegangb: im confused what oware is
 Keegangb: is that a standalone game
 Keegangb: i mean a game on this platform
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa</a>
 struct: its currently 40ºC in the room
 MSmits: it's a bot game
 MSmits: lol struct
 Astrobytes: that's just summer in Portugal
 MSmits: if you check the leaderboard, my bot is the highest ranking non-NN and it's only 8th :P
 MSmits: 9th also NN
 Keegangb: jeez nn is just so op
 MSmits: Keegangb oware is an exception though
 MSmits: it's really easy to write a nn for it
 MSmits: much harder for other games
 Keegangb: do you know what highest non NN for csb is?
 Astrobytes: *relative to some other games that is
 MSmits: let me check
 Astrobytes: Yurkov?
 MSmits: not sure if yurko is NN
 MSmits: might be
 MSmits: he had a good smitsimax bot, beat mine
 MSmits: i think thats still it
 MSmits: so yeah yurko
 Astrobytes: Yeah he went in hard on that, all of ru did I think
 Keegangb: ok cool so doable for sure getting top 10
 MSmits: yeah seems so
 MSmits: Keegangb it's probably the hardest game on CG to get top 10 in
 MSmits: and thats not even because of the NNs
 MSmits: some people spent months on their bot
 Keegangb: yea i figured it would be since its the first game u get presented with
 MSmits: that too
 Keegangb: yea i want to make this a little project and a good challenge
 MSmits: sure is
 TobiasA: i know a lot of people who play that oware game in real life. i didn't even know it was in codingame too:joy:
 MSmits: TobiasA cool, there are a lot of variants though
 MSmits: different game rules
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure, it's popular though
 struct: i still need to finish my csb bot
 Keegangb: okay well i might just stick to non-NN for a while cause im far too lazy for all the groundwork required for NN at the moment
 Keegangb: does legend introduce yet more information than gold for scb?
 Keegangb: csbb*
 MSmits: also if you do csb, then noone shared a full framework, they did for oware
 MSmits: (nn framework)
 struct: legend has 200 thrust instead of 100
 Astrobytes: No, other than the max thrust
 Keegangb: ok thats not too bad
 Keegangb: most code would still apply
 MSmits: all other games stop changing rules after bronze btw
 Astrobytes: And there's the Nash-DQN article by pb 
 MSmits: csb is a big exception in many ways
 Astrobytes: *pb and Agad e
 MSmits: yeah thats helpful and gives some detail, but nowhere near what marchet e did
 MSmits: they specifically kept some things to themselves
 Astrobytes: Indeed. Different though
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article</a>
 Keegangb: ok nice
 Keegangb: ok bookmarked the marchete link tho for when i want to get into it
 MSmits: you and me both
 Keegangb: is it common to need a compressor for these games?
 struct: no
 MSmits: to compress the nn weights yes
 BlaiseEbuth: perhaps
 MSmits: for nn only Keegangb
 MSmits: not for any normal bot
 Keegangb: ok thats what i was wondering
 MSmits: you have 100k characters
 MSmits: depending on how long your lines are that's 3k/4k lines
 BlaiseEbuth: Ok, so NN are not normals. Racist
 MSmits: most bots are around 1k, 2k if someone gets obsessed
 Keegangb: ok yea doubt i'd need to worry then
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't worry, be happy
 MSmits: yeah, and this is without minifying
 MSmits: you could always do that too
 Keegangb: yea true thats an easy step to add in
 MSmits: anyways i am getting some sleep. 
 MSmits: gn!
 Keegangb: peace
 Res-c: I have booboo
 jacek: :scream:
 Marchete: Oo

 pices: gi
 pices: hi
 pices: how do i learn c++ 
 Keegangb: google c++ on youtube
 pices: lmao 
 Keegangb: err search
 pices: here
 pices: in games
 Keegangb: well this site cant really teach you a language
 Keegangb: just asks you to solve a variety of problems
 jojacorps: google en passant

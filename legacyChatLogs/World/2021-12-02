 UZUHAMA: uh oh
 UZUHAMA: Sometimes, you get hard one
 MynameisDuy: the last compete was hard 
 MynameisDuy: but this one
 UZUHAMA: even harder?
 MynameisDuy: it is VERY VERY HARD
 UZUHAMA: Oof
 UZUHAMA: Well, you just gotta try your best
 MynameisDuy: ok!

 UZUHAMA: Oh my
 MynameisDuy: i have to input the up and down row
 UZUHAMA: I haven't got the slightest clue
 MynameisDuy: it is too hard
 MynameisDuy: im giving up&#160;;-;
 UZUHAMA: Hey
 UZUHAMA: Try using nested for loop
 MynameisDuy: wut?
 MynameisDuy: im using c++
 UZUHAMA: Are there no nested for loop in c++?
 MynameisDuy: not really
 MynameisDuy: 4 minutes left
 UZUHAMA: Oh no
 UZUHAMA: Did anybody else solved it?

 ZXC01: whats wrong...
 Dren: isn't ord already an int?
 ZXC01: no.....
 ZXC01: i got 80%
 Dren: I don't know the challange so I can't tell the problem
 Dren: but you can probably just write that as sum(map(ord,s))/len(s)
 ZXC01: use acii value added up from a string to divide by the length of the string and round it off
 ZXC01: wait what?????
 ZXC01: so short?
 Dren: map(ord,s) will iterate through the string and turn the letters into the number ord returns
 Medoo: wow coool
 ZXC01: wow thanks
 Dren: if you have a string like '1434234'
 Dren: and you want to take every digit 
 ZXC01: but the string i thought is letters?
 Dren: you can also use map(int,num)
 Wontonimo: Hearthbell nice bronze pod racing bot
 Hearthbell: Oh thanks Wontonimo! I found this site earlier today and fiddling around with the bots is pretty fun

 DialFrost: hi guys
 DialFrost: how do i shorten this
 DialFrost: if gets==0;puts 0;else;a=gets.split();b=a.map(&amp;:to_i);a.map!{|x|x.to_i.abs}.sort!;puts (b.include?a[0])?a[0]:a[0].to_i*-1;end
 DialFrost: its in ruby
 Superwog1: wat
 DialFrost: code golf for temperatures
 BlueArtemis: DialFrost you can call methods without parentheses if without a parameter
 BlueArtemis: gets.split() --&gt; gets.split
 DialFrost: whoops
 DialFrost: im not very fluent in ruby&#160;:/
 BlueArtemis: and a[0].to_i*-1 can be shortened into -a[0].to_i
 DialFrost: but if i do test case no.2 will fail
 Superwog1: blueartemis are u 13
 DialFrost: wait nvrm
 DialFrost: anyone else can help shorten?
 ZXC01: try a different method
 DialFrost: thats part of the reason y i need help
 ZXC01: o
 ZXC01: i think you could delete the first part "gets==0;puts 0
 DialFrost: then it can print 0
 ZXC01: i think it could since the programe is finding the one nearest to 0
 DialFrost: nope
 DialFrost: it will mess up the code
 DialFrost: the program starts printing random numbers in the list
 ZXC01: oh
 derjack: :upside_down:
 DialFrost: any ruby pros out there?
 DialFrost: *abit more refined
 DialFrost: if gets==0&amp;&amp;0;else;a=gets.split;b=a.map &amp;:to_i;a.map!{|x|x.to_i.abs}.sort!;k=a[0];p b.member?(k)?k:-k.to_i;end
 PATTRIM: thx for ans
 ZXC01: lol
 ZXC01: its only a part
 DialFrost: er no its not
 DialFrost: its the full length code
 DialFrost:&#160;:/
 ZXC01: wow thx
 ZXC01: jk
 DialFrost: atlthough the code is too long
 DialFrost: rank 700/900
 DialFrost: rubbish
 ZXC01: why you use ruby
 DialFrost: its short
 DialFrost: although im figuring out how to remove a big chunk of my code
 ZXC01: but code golf are seperated
 DialFrost: 1# is 29 chrs
 DialFrost: in perl
 ZXC01: the languages
 FlyingWormOfPower_efa8: cheers banach
 DialFrost: ye
 DialFrost: the more langauages u code in
 DialFrost: the more cp u get

 PMG_The_samurai: anyone excel in c :nerd:
 radioctiv: hey
 radioctiv: not exellent but prob can get job done
 PMG_The_samurai: anyone execel in c
 PMG_The_samurai: need a help
 derjack: just ask the question
 PMG_The_samurai: how can we se dynamic allocations to enter elements of an array
 Uljahn: like vectors in c++?
 PMG_The_samurai: malloc functions

 Uljahn: why don't you want to solve it yourself? at least there is a plenty of resources on the web to borrow some ideas from
 PMG_The_samurai: no iam problem with using malloc function thats why i ask i coudnot found any resources describe it much more clear
 Milanovich: How do i make my code of 277 python characters into code of less than 200?
 DoomedDictator_ba8d: delete windows
 Aquajag: i'm new here. trying to find things in "learn" that will tell me how to manipulate strings or use arrays in python. cause the games all seem to assume I already know how to do that. but the search box brings up mostly games. how can i search the learning space?
 Uljahn: use other sites and online tutorials to learn basics, then come back to practice
 Aquajag: ok. well i came here because when i googled places to learn coding it suggested this site. But I'm finding this site isn't about learning, it's about practice? any suggestions on places to learn? 
 Milanovich: w3schools imo
 Ajaiy: You can find a book about your language in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://books.goalkicker.com/">https://books.goalkicker.com/</a> (if you are ok with books)
 Aquajag: generally I like books! but i was looking for something book-free this time around
 Aquajag: thanks for the suggestions
 derjack: codeacademy? kaggle?
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.learnpython.org/">https://www.learnpython.org/</a>
 Aquajag: i'll check kaggle. i am trying codeacadamy, but it seems to think i should sit through an hour of "why coding is a good thing to learn and how to get a job with it" first.

 GER-NaN: I read that pastebin and I dont even see a question in it.... maybe thats why
 Mortis_666: can i create a multiplayer game with python?
 Uljahn: on CG? no
 dirri: shortest code is the most stupid shit i ever seen 
 dirri: congrats who ever added that to clas 
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like a challenge: get maven to compile python and upload it here
 BlaiseEbuth: Another c# coder... :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: thank you for being so open-minded
 Mortis_666: 😢😢
 dirri: im done playing that shit 
 dirri: rank 700 in 2 days 
 dirri: but cant go further 
 dirri: cz of this useless invention 
 Uljahn: genuine clash experience
 BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 GER-NaN: :sob:
 dirri: check the last notification 
 dirri: second place with 1:16 and 62 chars
 dirri: first place 8:18 ad 56 chars 
 Uljahn: oO
 dirri: what is that? a competition&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: last notification. Superwig1 is following me. good to know
 BlaiseEbuth: Well. Yes&#160;?
 dirri: he spend 8x more time 
 dirri: for only 10 chars improvement 
 dirri: actually 6 
 Uljahn: bruh
 GER-NaN: thats what you should do. stop crying
 eulerscheZahl: actually 6.55 as much time, not 8 times
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. That's the fact that thinking people do beter than fast ones that trigger you? :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: you are free to use the remaining 13min to go online and look up some stuff of your programming language of choice to get it shorter
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: turtle
 Automaton2000: what do you mean by that
 eulerscheZahl: but surely you spent 2 days on it already, so you are mastering the subject and i shouldn't tell you what to do
 Mortis_666: bruh what is kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: language from jetbrains teams
 Uljahn: java for codegolf
 Westicles: dirri, as ombudsman I would be happy to arbitrate if you file a formal complaint
 eulerscheZahl: compiles to JVM, as does Java. so they can be combined
 BlaiseEbuth: You can use clojure too. :3
 Uljahn: or scala
 eulerscheZahl: no one should ever use clojure
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 Mortis_666: is the kotlin the only way to make a bot programming game?
 GER-NaN: can code make api calls over the internet when in the Arena?
 eulerscheZahl: any JVM language works
 eulerscheZahl: most use Java to create games here
 Mortis_666: hmm ok
 eulerscheZahl: no internet connection GER-NaN
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course GER-NaN, very useful to use external super-computer for NNs.
 Mortis_666: o i saw ur dice duel game is 97.3% made with js
 GER-NaN: hmm ok thanks, guess someone already thought of my idea.... ima dummy
 eulerscheZahl: because i included that 3D library by copy-pasting the entire thing
 eulerscheZahl: the player interaction part is Java
 Mortis_666: that game is op
 dirri: how to delete account? 
 eulerscheZahl: i spent some time to get the UI working that way. it was messing with my brain really hard
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/settings">https://www.codingame.com/settings</a>scroll to the bottom dirri
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Because clashs are the whole platform ^^
 dirri: cool ty
 eulerscheZahl: when you rotate a die, you rotate around the internal coordinate system. but this is different to the external one so you can easily mix that up
 Westicles: dirri, I will also delete your complaint ticket
 GER-NaN: dirri, do some Bot Programming, its much funner
 GER-NaN: than challenges
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>that's where CodinGame shines

 Coderboi270: hi
 XmerpX: i did the codecademy java course and i cant do a thing on here
 5DN1L: What have you tried here so far?

 5DN1L: Have you tried any of the practice puzzles? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 XmerpX: yea stuff that i make just doesnt work
 XmerpX: im going to keep trying and hopefully learn more

 XmerpX: thanks
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 jacek: some quite experienced people struggle with the inputs/outputs thing here at first
 XmerpX: what confuses me so much is printing numbers makes games run. or printing words does
 Coderboi270: Can someone help me
 5DN1L: be specific in the type of help you need
 Coderboi270: mad pod racing 
 XmerpX: well thank you for the help my class is over so i gtg
 Coderboi270: the 2nd boos
 5DN1L: the 2nd boss boos...
 5DN1L: ok, what's the problem about the 2nd boss?
 Coderboi270: i cant win
 jacek: are there some hints? i think there was something about angle &lt; -90 or 180
 Coderboi270: idk
 5DN1L: the thrust should be set based on the angle
 5DN1L: does your code consider that?
 Coderboi270: i have no clue
 5DN1L: what's the logic of your current code?
 Coderboi270: what do you mean by that
 5DN1L: does your output change based on the inputs?
 5DN1L: or does your code always output the same numbers no matter what?
 Coderboi270: I think it does change 
 5DN1L: like how
 tutopiw: hi
 MynameisDuy: hi
 Wontonimo: hi 5DN1L , Coderboi270 , tutopiw , and MynameisDuy.  What's everyone working on?
 jacek: should have update the arch more frequently...
 Wontonimo: hey Coderboi270 , you have to increase the speed to 80 or 100 to beat boss 2.  Also you have to use the new submit button
 Wontonimo: arch jacek?
 jacek: archlinux
 jacek: after update some graphics fail
 Wontonimo: why archlinux instead of an alternative like ubuntu?
 eulerscheZahl: arch doesnt try to force snap on you
 jacek: eeyup
 Wontonimo: wow, i'm so out of the loop&lt;loop&gt;inside&lt;/loop&gt;   outside wontonimo
 eulerscheZahl: snap is a software manager - like apt-get or pacman
 jacek: ubuntu seems quite proprietary
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still using ubuntu (but not their default gnome interface)
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't understand some steps they are taking
 eulerscheZahl: evolving like CG does
 jacek: are they renaming stuff?
 LE_Shiol: guys what is the easiest to learn coding language?
 Kanerix: python i think
 LE_Shiol: okay, thank you
 Wontonimo: nope, I'd say scratch.mit.edu is the easiest
 Wontonimo: seriously, if you've never programmed before really consider it.  It looks like a kids toy but you can make full physics simulations with it.  It is turing complete 
 Wontonimo: then once you understand conditions and loops, go to something like python or javascript
 LE_Shiol: Oh, okay thanks for the tip
 LE_Shiol: Guess, i'll learn scartch first
 Wontonimo: what is your background with programming?  have you taken any courses?  and what is your highest level of math?
 LE_Shiol: Non
 Wontonimo: how about math?  (the reason i ask is because there are a lot of reusable concepts)
 LE_Shiol: im gonna be honest im just a 12 y/o child
 LE_Shiol: so no
 LE_Shiol: im gonna need to learn scartch, im still too dumb
 Wontonimo: okay.  Scratch may be a very happy place for at least the first couple months!
 LE_Shiol: Okay, thank you
 Wontonimo: it's really fun, but don't let that make you think you are not learning
 LE_Shiol: Okay, i always wanted to learn how to code
 Wontonimo: just make sure you spend time trying to add loops and conditions!
 LE_Shiol: Okay
 LE_Shiol: I gotta sleep now its 2:27 am of night.. im gonna get sick :P
 Wontonimo: l8r
 LE_Shiol: okay
 5DN1L: A more ancient language for beginners is LOGO. I don't know whether LOGO is still being used now :joy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/1zMtYi2TNTA?t=229">https://youtu.be/1zMtYi2TNTA?t=229</a>
 Wontonimo: I went to a coding camp as a child and LOGO was the language we learnt
 eulerscheZahl: &gt; are they renaming stuff?yes jacek. they have default tools like nautilus and call it "Files" instead
 GER-NaN: wow, removing my "preferred" placement of radars and letting a fill algorithm boosted me into gold league.. 
 jacek: crystal rush?
 GER-NaN: yea, its a fun game
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl?
 Abdirizaq: clash of code is hard to start from the beginnign
 Abdirizaq: like i dont knew nothing and doing clash of code
 Abdirizaq: know*
 jacek: this site isnt for complete beginners
 Abdirizaq: yea i guess
 Abdirizaq: how long it took u to learn coding?
 Illedan: It is for NP-complete beginners
 Wontonimo: i'm still learning and i've been at it for 40 years
 TeslaRam: hido i get xp for completing clash of code?
 Abdirizaq: im going to start uni this January and i want to learn from now 
 Wontonimo: but more practically, be patient without yourself.  It'll be about 100 hours of practice until the basics sink in, another 1000 hours of practice until it starts to be fluid 
 jacek: no. only one-time achievements like 50 clash of codes completed
 TeslaRam: thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: patient without yourself? :thinking:
 Wontonimo: *with
 Abdirizaq: is 1 month enough to learn coding?
 Abdirizaq: from zero experience 
 Wontonimo: there are 2 kinds of people in the world, those who can work with incomplete and incorrect data.
 Wontonimo: how good do you need to be Abdirizaq&#160;?
 jacek: alphazero mastered go in 4 hours. srely you can do things from zero in 1 month
 Wontonimo: if your goal is to print "hello world" on the screen, then yes, 1 month is enoug
 Abdirizaq: im good at printing stuff in c++
 Abdirizaq: like example 
 GER-NaN: nice! :grinning:
 jacek: Abdirizaq instead of clash of codes, try easy puzzle
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a> or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures</a>

 Abdirizaq: books help right
 Abdirizaq: yes in uni c/c++
 jacek: dunno. i learn by doing, not only reading
 Abdirizaq: give some advice how did u learn coding&#160;?
 Abdirizaq: im sry for asking a lot of questions 
 jacek: it was so long ago i dont remember. i started before i was 10
 jacek: i used... delphi, but it was mostly point and click, arranging buttons and make them show some text
 BlaiseEbuth: :older:
 BlaiseEbuth: :older_man:
 jacek: i also remember writing in some basic for nes clone

 AntiSquid: and wow games do get renamed
 struct: you started programming before you were 10?
 struct: damn
 jacek: i was antisocial before that
 AntiSquid: on the day he was a born a portal opened and he rolled out with his computer desk on wheels
 struct: I probably havent even touched a pc by that age
 jacek: they werent invented yet?
 struct: they were
 nyloc:&#160;;) I remeber my first pc at the age ot 10 a pentium 133 MhZ with a 2GB SCSCI HDD and 128MB memory. As if it was yesterday :P
 struct: maybe a gameboy if it can be considered a computer
 struct: gameboy color I think
 struct: or advanced
 nyloc: I was so happy when i upgraded my win 3.11 to win 95 all on my self
 jacek: 128MB? seems a lot
 jacek: my first pc was p3 450MHz with 64MB
 Uljahn: my first programmable calculator had only 104 cells of code memory
 struct: no idea what my first pc specs were
 nyloc: Yeah, my dad payed for that memory and a cd burner as I promised to digitalize his dvr stuff and all his LPs
 nyloc: I think I still owe him as I never finished
 jacek: you can buy him 128MB memory now
 PhantomChild_80c1: hello friends i come with pandas
 PhantomChild_80c1: tell me all your woes
 jacek: oO
 nyloc: I like pandas
 Uljahn: i like numpy
 nyloc: and dask
 nyloc:&#160;;)
 PhantomChild_80c1: your mother is a padna
 PhantomChild_80c1: im sorry i tell the truth
 jacek: oh my
 visva: stop the hate
 JONMS: anyone else here getting the a bad feeling in their body just thinking about coding?
 stagomon: i get a bad feelnig thinking about no pandas
 JONMS: well, i could stop driving my diesel
 JONMS: maybe it'll save the rainforest
 stagomon: do you also eat fried panda
 stagomon: pandas are yum
 stagomon: im sory but the rainforests are made of bamboo
 stagomon: calculate the f = ma of deez
 stagomon: yes
 stagomon: i see
 stagomon: nobody knows the answer
 stagomon: because deez are too large
 surgutti: at which past contest you had the most fun?
 surgutti: i'm looking for something to do
 jacek: fc2020?
 Westicles: ice and fire
 surgutti: whats the meta in fc2020?
 <b>**AntiSquid nervously searches to see which one is fc2020</b></p><p><img src="/a/46567648927625" /> DomiKo: witches
 jacek: witch
 DomiKo: there is no meta in fc2020
 jacek: try to win by making opponent lose
 surgutti: need to note
 jacek: :nerd:
 AntiSquid: none of these games have a meta, do they&#160;?
 surgutti: first in ranking isn't meta?
 AntiSquid: maybe spring2021 has a meta i guess
 AntiSquid: not when it's all about fastest search, no surgutti
 surgutti: faster doesnt mean better
 jacek: thats what she said
 AntiSquid: the word meta as it is generally used in online games doesn't make sense here
 surgutti: so its only about luck
 AntiSquid: yes, we are playing bingo in here#
 Westicles: kids say meta when they are asking for the winning strategy?
 AntiSquid: yes Westicles
 Westicles: I think they just don't know any other words
 AntiSquid: well strategies 
 Westicles: like chuck norris only with a meta button and a meme button
 surgutti: i think in greek meta means to excel
 AntiSquid: beyond
 AntiSquid: you should have paid attention to zuck's new ad
 surgutti: since when did zuck change company name to meta?
 surgutti: im somehow outdated
 jacek: ok boomer

 AntiSquid: is aCat your teacher surgutti&#160;?
 surgutti: nope
 surgutti: im in highschool now
 surgutti: &amp; 2 years till end
 AntiSquid: your profile says uni of worclaw 
 surgutti: because i'm going there next

 JOKEER: a
 Abdirizaq: where should i find easy practices for beginners
 C26_1: @Abdirizaq, it should be w3schools
 Abdirizaq: ok thx
 C26_1: There you can find the lesson and at the end of any lesson, you'll find the practice box
 Abdirizaq: how long it will take you the lessons 
 C26_1: well
 Abdirizaq: 1 month should be enough right to get better at coding
 C26_1: It depends on your knowledge
 C26_1: It you're new, read the lesson slowly as muchas possible
 C26_1: Only very know about the small, you can know the large
 C26_1: Good luck
 C26_1: @Abdirizaq, There's something that I should advice to you
 C26_1: Do not ever to jump-learn
 C26_1: That means you skipped a lot of lesson between two of them and you suddenly so confused
 C26_1: So if you new, don't try hard topic like Neural Network, or Something higher that that
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: Except that do not asking on Stackoverflow
 Abdirizaq: should I finish the lesson first or do lesson plus practice  
 C26_1: Some of the programmers will laugh at you or maybe very angry about your question if you ask very simple
 C26_1: @Abdirizaq
 C26_1: As I mentioned before, you should read the lesson first
 C26_1: When you know you can deal with it, do the practice
 Abdirizaq: ok thanks 
 Abdirizaq: @c26_1 i wouldn't take it seriously if someone laughs at me cuz everyone started from where I am today
 Abdirizaq: if you going to learn something ignore the haters 
 Abdirizaq: never let someone tell you can't do that 
 Abdirizaq: im sorry but i am so motivations lol 
 Abdirizaq: have*
 Abdirizaq: some*

 UZUHAMA: Does anybody know how to view all the puzzles I've solved?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: to see the easy puzzles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Wontonimo: and scroll to the bottom
 Wontonimo: repeat for the medium, hard, and very hard
 Wontonimo: Abdirizaq , how's it going?
 UZUHAMA: Oh thx
 Wontonimo: hows it going UZUHAMA&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what puzzles have you worked on lagetly?
 UZUHAMA: Um, I re-solved Fax Machine, Descent, and Folding Paper for last few days
 UZUHAMA: Also, I worked on Mad Pod Racing for little bit
 Wontonimo: that's how you level up&#160;!  Awesome job
 UZUHAMA: :DD
 Thorcode: nice
 Thorcode: won could you help me with brain fork?
 Wontonimo: looks like there are about 3 people actively competing on mad pod racing right now.  2 in wood 2, 1 in bronze
 Wontonimo: i haven't done brain fork
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: you got rank so high
 Thorcode: in that puzzle
 Wontonimo: oh, looks like i did lol
 Abdirizaq: @wontonimo so far not bad I finished reading first lesson 
 Thorcode: because you finish all of the certification
 Abdirizaq: in w3school 
 Wontonimo: oh, brain fork used to be called code of the relms or or something like that
 Thorcode: that why I'm asking for your help
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: I know that
 Wontonimo: my solution isn't optimized or anything but it works
 Wontonimo: i can tell you what it does at a high level, no problem
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: thanks
 Wontonimo: create a function that computes the cost of changing a given magic stone to the letter you need
 Wontonimo: the cost includes all the commands to move there and rotate the letter to the one needed.
 Thorcode: oh this is like the one I asked you
 Wontonimo: use that to rank all the stones
 Thorcode: I think I know how to do this
 Wontonimo: then change the stone the ranks the least
 Wontonimo: that 's pretty much all i do
 Thorcode: this like the one that I ask how far from z
 Wontonimo: it you want to take it to the next level, then do a search into the future
 Thorcode: thanks
 Wontonimo: I think you can get pretty high by using a BEAM search and calculating a solution offline
 Wontonimo: haha, they renamed Bilbo to "Blub"
 Wontonimo: poor Bilbo
 Thorcode: oh tha t is the boy name
 struct: Hi Wontonimo, are you currently working on any multi?
 Wontonimo: nope
 Thorcode: is the new string challenge is bot programming?
 Wontonimo: i'm fantasizing about making the worlds best multi ever but making sure my expectations are so far out of reach that there is no point in even trying to start coding it
 struct: would be hard to beat some of the games here
 Wontonimo: my method ensures I don't have to do any work.  It's ideal actually
 struct: lol
 Wontonimo: in all seriousness, i've gotten interested in shaders and compute shaders again
 Wontonimo: have i coded any?  nope.  have i been practicing (like i tell others to do)? nope.
 Wontonimo: what have you been up to struct?
 struct: not much
 struct: trying to find motivation to code :p
 Wontonimo: yeah, me too
 Wontonimo: I was looking at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ajanse.me/asciidots/demo-src/">https://ajanse.me/asciidots/demo-src/</a>
 Wontonimo: use the dropdown to pick counter
 Wontonimo: it is a calculating circuit using ascii art.  thought it would make a good puzzle ... but would have to make small changes so people don't just copy the code
 struct: looks interesting
 struct: but is not my beach
 struct: I dont know if its an english phrase what I said
 struct: but we use quite it portugal 
 struct: we use quite a lot*
 Wontonimo: it hit the feels for me.  reminded me of a game i played in 6th grade that was about laying down circuits
 struct: you can even use the sdk I think
 struct: to make graphic version for it
 struct: if it  passes
 struct: but that might be a bit challenging
 Wontonimo: yeah.
 Wontonimo: i started working on this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75474b51e6b3186ea493a8467395fbbefad7">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75474b51e6b3186ea493a8467395fbbefad7</a> but lost steam 
 struct: I see ascii art and I run
 struct: sorry :p
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: i get it
 struct: Some people enjoy it though
 Wontonimo: i suppose it could be changed to coloured blocks
 Wontonimo: instead of ascii characters
 Wontonimo: it would be the same thing
 struct: Not sure you can change color on statement
 struct: unless you use sdk
 struct: WW was renamed to Amazonial
 Wontonimo: so sad
 struct: Maybe they will go to amazons instead when searching it :D
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 struct: maybe ill remake Othello 
 struct: and put better graphics on it
 Wontonimo: and just update the same game or as a new game?
 struct: The same game
 struct: I should have released with book prevention
 struct: but i dont care much
 Wontonimo: i move river crossing out of WIP.  Noone's been commenting and the upvotes have been nice
 struct: as long as people have fun
 Wontonimo: why book prevention?  cuz you have had enough of MS's booking&#160;?
 struct: Not MS's fault
 struct: Im just not really a fan of them
 struct: This is why amazons starting positions are randomized
 struct: instead of the default one
 Wontonimo: I haven't tried to book.  I should, to stretch my skills.
 struct: There was a list with 13k starting positions
 struct: I cant find the link
 struct: But when it was suggested it was already too late
 Wontonimo: well, if you only have a small amount of coding motivation .. you could try my new medium puzzle&#160;;)
 struct: linki?

 Wontonimo: hey ZXC01 , you dm'd me about search race.  so, you need to put the checkpoints in an array
 Wontonimo: but the code you shared just concats them as a string
 Wontonimo: nextx+=str(checkpoint_x)+' '
 Wontonimo: instead you'll want something like
 Wontonimo: checkpoints = []  # at the top
 Superwig1: lists
 Wontonimo: checkpoints.append( [checkpoint_x , checkpoint_y] )
 Wontonimo: instead of 
 Wontonimo:     nextx+=str(checkpoint_x)+' '
 Superwig1: Wyy did someone change my name from superwog1 to superwig1?
 ZXC01: then?

 Wontonimo: ^^ look there
 ZXC01: ok
 ZXC01: oh thx
 ZXC01: i passed the test!
 Wontonimo: oh, i just rewrote my bot using my search race bot using my new PID controller and drifting skills&#160;! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/594356040">https://www.codingame.com/replay/594356040</a>
 struct: how many turns ahead do you searcH?
 Wontonimo: 1
 struct: nice
 Wontonimo: and no search
 Wontonimo: just a drift calculation
 struct: looks good for 1 turn
 Wontonimo: power 100 if no drift detected, power 20 if a drift is detected
 ZXC01: oo
 Wontonimo: hmm .. it doesn't do Tokyo drift well.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/594356405">https://www.codingame.com/replay/594356405</a>

 pmor: Wontonimo - thanks for your help yesterday.  Couldn't find out what was wrong with my mcts, so I rewrote it a bit differently today.  I'm now smacking MightyCarlo around&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: AWESOME&#160;!!!
 struct: My bot doesnt even get 100% Wontonimo
 struct: for some reason
 Wontonimo: what was it?  did you ever find out or just a rewrite didn't copy the old problem
 pmor: I have no idea what the issue was.  Just rewrote it from scratch.
 Wontonimo: that is some awesome dedication
 Wontonimo: did you add unit tests?
 pmor: I have unit tests but I couldn't figure out a good way to really debug the mcts
 ZXC01: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/594356618">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/594356618</a>
 pmor: I printed out the tree and analyzed it, but I still couldn't figure out what was wrong
 ZXC01: worst code ever
 Wontonimo: oh, nice replay ZXC01&#160;!
 ZXC01: ....
 ZXC01: thats the worst ever
 Wontonimo: that's actually really good, don't knock it.  you are using the 3v steering PID correction
 pmor: I did do some more optimizations and get ~35k iterations
 Wontonimo: okay cow pmor&#160;!  that's awesome stuff
 Wontonimo: you must be in legend now
 Wontonimo: okay, if you want to add drift ZXC01 , the trick is to make a look like this
 pmor: still finishing up the run, but i'm currently sitting #1
 Wontonimo: for _ in range(4):
 Wontonimo: and for each iteration through the loop just check if your car is within 600 units of the checkpoint
 Wontonimo: if it is, switch a boolean flag to true
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/594356787">https://www.codingame.com/replay/594356787</a>
 struct: not perfect
 struct: but not bad
 Wontonimo: then add your current velocity to your position
 Wontonimo: and do that in that loop
 Wontonimo: at the end of the loop, you'll have a flag that says if you will hit the next checkpoint in the next 4 rounds
 ZXC01: ah?
 Wontonimo: if you are, then change the index of the checkpoint you are targeting to be the next one like so
 Wontonimo: target[(index+1)%len(target)]
 Wontonimo: hey, that's nice struct.  let me see if i can find my old solutions tokyo solution

 Wontonimo: i like that version.  3d just seems like a distraction.  if you are excited about it then DEFINITELY DO IT&#160;!
 struct: well not excited per say
 struct: I just dont like the rotation animation of that one
 Wontonimo: make it explode and shake the table with a new one forming from the shattered pieces in a reverse entropy reconstruction
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: jk.  how were you thinnking of making it 3d?  what library/tools would you use?
 struct: same one that euler used
 struct: I cant remember the name
 struct: three js
 struct: I think

 Wontonimo: it's really easy for stuff like that
 struct: yes I have tried it before
 struct: I was gonna port some game with it
 Wontonimo: not a whole lot harder  to add shaders where i did this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://panchishin.github.io/shader/square_shade.html">https://panchishin.github.io/shader/square_shade.html</a>
 struct: but I abandoned it
 Wontonimo: what was the concept behind the game?
 struct: its called laser chess
 struct: also know as "keth"
 struct: just another board game :p
 Wontonimo: the angle in search race is true angle and not angle to next checkpoint&#160;!
 Ace1234: Wait, How do we make two console.logs?
 struct: console.error
 struct: to debug
 Ace1234: Ok

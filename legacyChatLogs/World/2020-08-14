 dbdr: so no
 dbdr: right click on the right zone of the editor, then right arrow on the kbd
 dbdr: seems too much right is bad :D

 dbdr: why?
 kovi: yay, im above
 dbdr: you're competing with past dbdr? :D
 eulerscheZahl: he started later than you
 dbdr: oh sure
 kovi: you still online?
 eulerscheZahl: who?
 kovi: or local hardcode. dbdr?
 dbdr: "you"
 dbdr: offline
 dbdr: but not optimized yet
 eulerscheZahl: i'm online again for an hour maybe. didn't put an all-nighter
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm hardtoading&#160;:(
 dbdr: how to run a local simulation of euler?
 jrke: kovi do you know about mini samegame contest&#160;?
 kovi: what do you mean?
 jrke: you have to eat a toad dbdr for running euler sim
 dbdr: "you"
 eulerscheZahl: you need a lot of obscure dependencies for it, not recommended to install
 dbdr: perl code?
 eulerscheZahl: now i can't find a nonsense reply to keep this going
 eulerscheZahl: btw smits of solving online too

 Thyl: Morning
 jrke: yeee i didn't believe myself made 29000 points
 eulerscheZahl: live-clash-of-codewhat is Thibaud doing on discord? creating a different place to share invites than this chat?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, are those even different servers than the regular CG discord?
 Illedan: No
 Illedan: or
 Illedan: :shrug:
 jrke: oh ya i also saw live clash of code 
 eulerscheZahl: but clicking the links just tells me that the server isn't public
 eulerscheZahl: i guess he's still in the middle of adding it

 dbdr: TS and D got added, Julia was not far behind
 Andriamanitra: :thumbsup:
 dbdr: welcome to the club, Illedan&#160;:)
 jrke: wait i will try to be in that club
 dbdr: ok&#160;:)
 jrke: my online sim got 36k points will run offline
 Andriamanitra: can i only be on the leaderboard once? i was going to snag the coveted #1 spot for lua in samegame
 eulerscheZahl: the 100k club?
 jrke: there is no one from lua currently
 eulerscheZahl: Andriamanitra only your highest score is shown
 Andriamanitra: well i'm f'd then
 Andriamanitra: i'm never going to beat 32k
 jrke: 5 c++ in top 10
 eulerscheZahl: there are barely more than 10 even trying more than just printing a valid move
 eulerscheZahl: so you see the language preference of active users, doesn't tell anything about the language performance at all
 dbdr: most of us could submit in lua too if we wanted&#160;:)
 dbdr: with the same score
 eulerscheZahl: i feel like i could even get a higher score in lua
 kovi: not me
 eulerscheZahl: as you are playing for real and make me feel a little shabby
 eulerscheZahl: you definitely have the better algo
 jrke: is there any in 100k club without harcoding?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 2
 eulerscheZahl: kovi and smits
 jrke: wow
 dbdr: domiko too maybe?
 Andriamanitra: what'd harcoding
 jrke: they are nearly to beat dbdr hardcoded
 eulerscheZahl: can't tell for domiko
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure dbdr will raise his score
 dbdr: not 100K, but will be
 jrke: and he is not in 100k club currently
 jrke: domiko ^
 eulerscheZahl: chat is laggy as i'm using 7 out of 8 threads for the puzzle&#160;:/
 dbdr: really? :D
 Andriamanitra: i thought the solutions run serverside
 dbdr: how many bogomips eulerscheZahl?
 Andriamanitra: seems a bit unfair to run them on clients
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr started this
 dbdr: it's fair since everyone can do it
 Andriamanitra: but not everyone has same hardware available
 Andriamanitra: or time
 dbdr: also, MSmits made me realize, there is more luck involved with running online
 eulerscheZahl: of course. you might be able to clean the board for 1k extra points
 dbdr:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?&#160;?
 dbdr: I did not follow how what you said connected with the rest
 eulerscheZahl: "luck factor" -&gt; i agree
 eulerscheZahl: as the 1k bonus for an empty board is significant and you won't always be able to get it
 dbdr: right, that's a dominant aspect
 kovi: true
 Andriamanitra: maybe the validators should be randomized and just repeated enough times that you can take average
 dbdr: and the luck is amplified by having to be lucky in many validators at once
 dbdr: when validators are randomized, people submit many many times
 eulerscheZahl: random validators are a bad idea. you can't get the same score on each board
 dbdr: which is not good for CG servers
 eulerscheZahl: so the board would be more relevant than your algo to some degree
 jrke: whats best for vertical lines&#160;?
 dbdr: Andriamanitra: it's true there is also unfairness offline, but I think less. I don't have a fast CPU
 Andriamanitra: algos are already mostly irrelevant if we're pre-calculating everything
 dbdr: very much not true
 dbdr: algos are extermely relevant
 dbdr: Numbershifting showed this brilliantly
 eulerscheZahl: 9803 i think jrke
 Andriamanitra: you don't even need to use the same algo for all of them for crying out loud
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/481754254">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/481754254</a>
 jrke: same me hardcoded 
 dbdr: using the best algo for each base is exactly what you do in real problems
 dbdr: there is nothing wrong with that
 Andriamanitra: yeah but you conveniently skip all of the stuff that you'd have to do to choose the right one
 eulerscheZahl: but the CG website design makes it a little unfair. we (lvl29+) can easily get the validators. new users won't even know that they are available
 dbdr: oh, definitely, we should make the validators available
 jrke: i made a code in which i enter mat and it gives me mat save in 2d array and moves as ouput for saving hardcoding
 dbdr: if you want to compete on solving problems fast, it's exactly the skills needed for multis
 dbdr: no need to make optim duplicate that
 dbdr: it's good that it's different
 dbdr: I mean "at real-time scale"
 dbdr: 50ms or so
 eulerscheZahl: i'm perfectly fine with some offline solving that is announced at such so everyone at least knows what's going on. see google hashcode
 dbdr: and NS&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 YurkovAS: samegame has referee with many validators?
 eulerscheZahl: 20 validators
 eulerscheZahl: i can file a PR on your repo dbdr
 jrke: ya even refree have random validator genarator
 dbdr: I was looking at doing that eulerscheZahl&#160;:)do you have something in a ready to use format?
 dbdr: I have something

 dbdr: right
 dbdr: aCat?
 aCat: hi
 eulerscheZahl: aToad?
 jrke: im ready for running local sim but i don't have time wanna go for lunch will do it later&#160;:(
 dbdr: what about pushing the referee to a git repo?
 dbdr: as YurkovAS was looking for it for instance
 aCat: I didn't find a good reason for this as the code is downloadable
 aCat: but i can
 eulerscheZahl: also helps those who want to understand the SDK. just more reference to look at
 dbdr: it's only dowloable for level29+, no?
 aCat: I'm learning sdk via downloading ccontributions
 aCat: 20
 eulerscheZahl: 29+ to find it now
 aCat: searching for githuybs is waste of time ;p
 aCat: ouch
 eulerscheZahl: as it's not pending anymore
 dbdr: CG trivia&#160;:)
 aCat: It is actually a github
 eulerscheZahl: then link it in the statement
 aCat: but inside my secret CG-solutions :P
 <b>**eulerscheZahl always does this :angle:</b>
 jrke: euler how many your local sim take for one complicated case
 jrke: time
 <b>**eulerscheZahl always does this :angel:</b>
 eulerscheZahl: i use the same time for all testcases
 aCat: and it has a readme pointing our related research
 jrke: whats that limit?
 jrke: how many ms or seconds?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even count the rollouts or anything, no idea
 eulerscheZahl: beam search with 2000 width
 jrke: ok
 eulerscheZahl: changed that, running with lower width and some randomness right now
 eulerscheZahl: new score: 129004
 dbdr: nice
 eulerscheZahl: still running. and theer's 4 cases i don't clear yet

 Westicles: jrke, I cheated.... I already did these back in 2012
 [CG]Thibaud: GeRiY I suggest you check the forum post related to the puzzle
 [CG]Thibaud: or ask your question directly
 Westicles: Though I didn't save the solutions
 dbdr: did you find your code?&#160;:)
 Westicles: Yeah, that dead Dell sitting in the corner had it on the hard drive
 dbdr: :D
 Westicles: Total mess.  There are around 10 parameters tuned for each case
 GeRiY: what is example what i need to put in output?
 GeRiY: number,number?
 jrke: x y
 GeRiY: its not help&#160;:/
 jrke: x cordinate,space,y co-ordinate
 GeRiY: i get a $line and its contain four three number and one dot

 ivandr: do anybody know how to see how much time code spend on answering??
 eulerscheZahl: use the stopwatch equivalent of your langauge
 Andriamanitra: use a stopwatch and watch the output carefully
 eulerscheZahl: start the timer *after* reading the input
 ivandr: this editor has debuging&amp;&amp;
 MSmits: you need to code it avandr
 ivandr: or you meant clock
 MSmits: ivandr
 MSmits: whatever your language has
 MSmits: it's code... so language dependent
 ivandr: of course
 ivandr: I understand
 MSmits: yes you still havent said which language....
 ivandr: C++
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: sec
 ivandr: clock()
 ivandr: function
 MSmits: nah
 ivandr: can measure time
 ivandr: I know
 eulerscheZahl: chrono has higher precision
 ivandr: yeahh
 MSmits: auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
 ivandr: hahah
 ivandr: good googling
 ivandr: thanks anyway
 MSmits: it's not googled lol. I have this in 20 bots :P
 ivandr: )
 eulerscheZahl: and you googled it the first time you needed it
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: I Robo-ed it
 eulerscheZahl: chat shared?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 ivandr: I thought that all puzzles will show me usage like in codeforces(
 MSmits: they will show you by timing you out if you're too slow, but otherwise you have to do it yourself
 MSmits: you need to time it anyway, because often, you want to use the full available time
 ivandr: ok
 MSmits: and you need to know when to cut the algo short
 eulerscheZahl: for puzzles it's usually not relevant
 MSmits: true
 ivandr: at some sense
 MSmits: it's relevant when you have an algorithm that's too slow and want to test different things that are faster I suppose
 MSmits: but that almost never happens afaik
 MSmits: it does in bot games and opti arenas ofc
 ivandr: mostly it used in machine learning - reinforcment learning - Monte Carlo

 Nicholas0901: Hi guys and gals, I am trying to figure out how to display information in my game
 Nicholas0901: I want to print out values without making the game crash. I can't wrap my head around the sys.stderr. Anyone able to quickly explain?Thanks
 Andriamanitra: stderr is a separate output stream that won't be read by the game
 Andriamanitra: how to use it depends on the language you're using
 aCat: yeah - I passed this awful first steps in creating new puzzle!
 aCat: nothing is visible
 aCat: no idea where to start coding
 aCat: :D
 MSmits: oh sry was shopping
 MSmits: not using bitset magic afaik
 MSmits: I use a bitboard for floodfill, but my color map is just int8_t[225]   i could probably do better here
 MSmits: Marchete
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 wlesavo: westicles i wonder if you already got to 1000 in NS? if thats not a secret ofc :slight_smile:
 Westicles: No, I stopped where it is on the leaderboard
 Westicles: I think dbdr could take it to a 1000 much easier
 wlesavo: oh, didnt notice you submitted, nice
 Nicholas0901: Thanks, so to anyone else who is new, the stderr is displayed in the console like the other input. Just you can filter to view the Debug only&#160;:)

 aCat: what's upperbound on on in-game sgapes while initializing?
 aCat: I can't show grids with &gt; 36x36
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/hKxlUgl">https://imgur.com/hKxlUgl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: sgapes?
 aCat: shapes
 Astrobytes: shapes I believe
 eulerscheZahl: 100kB for the initial turn, 30kB for later
 aCat: kB...
 eulerscheZahl: no pixi object limit, just ther replay size
 eulerscheZahl: i managed to get around it by doing it in JS directly
 eulerscheZahl: didn't publish teh code yet as I still have hopes for a contest
 Astrobytes: What did Thibaud say?
 Astrobytes: (re. your game)
 eulerscheZahl: will review it this week
 eulerscheZahl: the trick for the JS part: still use the SDK to register the entities (as this supports movement animations and all that)
 eulerscheZahl: but generate them in JS yourself for less data
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise you would have to reinvent frame transitions when the user starts sliding the timebar below the player
 aCat: kB.. so how I can optimize it? I use simple rectangles / lines
 aCat: I can cut the number of entities in half but hey I want this to be pretty&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: put it in a private github repo and add me to it if you want (same username as here)
 eulerscheZahl: i might not get to this today anymore. but it seems you can continue with it on a smaller map size for now and then scale it up later
 aCat: yeah, I just want some hints for the future
 aCat: I added you
 eulerscheZahl: got hte mail
 aCat: this is 90% irrelevant copy of the samegame
 eulerscheZahl: great commit message :D
 aCat: and 10% started jps puzzle
 aCat: viewer is working and just showing grid, player is irreblevant does nothing
 aCat: test 66 is large grid&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: the general approach: you create and register your own module in Java (like the tooltip module or toggle module from the SDK)
 eulerscheZahl: that module is responsible to serialize some data
 eulerscheZahl: you add the mathcing module in JS to extract the info and do something with it
 aCat: so you shift the workload to other part of the system that does not have such constraints?
 aCat: The only thing I did in javascript were 3 puzzles ;p
 eulerscheZahl: yes, whatever reduces replay size
 eulerscheZahl: i can add that part to your game to draw the map in JS.then you also have a reference to come back the next time you need it
 eulerscheZahl: took me about 2 days to get it working for my own game
 eulerscheZahl: not much code. but easy to miss one thing in the chain
 JBM: still using pixi, or ditched it altogether?
 eulerscheZahl: still pixi
 eulerscheZahl: as the SDK does the pixi handling and user interaction and all (pausing, resuming, ...)
 aCat: that would be great euler I might need it a lot, for later puzzles
 JBM: your teapot inspired me to push my html5 viewer concept a little further
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 aCat: this one can stick with small maps if forced to, cause its simple exercise
 eulerscheZahl: let's make our own SDK
 aCat: but, the extension I plan
 JBM: still not the ideal java-free svg-based thingy i'm aiming for
 JBM: but a bit closer
 aCat: will be in pain without HUGE maps
 eulerscheZahl: you can even get around java I thinkif you manage to tell maven to use something else
 JBM: i don't have the required maven level for that yet
 JBM: though i'm getting frightfully better at it
 JBM: but i'm not too scared of that
 JBM: i'm not too far from just pushing my binary along
 eulerscheZahl: aCat there are still limitations. pixi itself gets laggy with too many objects shown
 JBM: and re-extracting/running from java
 eulerscheZahl: so that 36x36 map already has &gt; 1000 objects
 eulerscheZahl: that's still fine but already pushing it to the limits
 aCat: so
 aCat: what's the ability to show 256x256 game maps?
 aCat: :D
 eulerscheZahl: compression? :D
 aCat: hmm, actually in this case
 eulerscheZahl: a chessboard would be a problem
 eulerscheZahl: but large areas could be combined in visuals
 aCat: I will probably stick with loading precomputed map png as a one image
 aCat: and draw on top of that if needed
 eulerscheZahl: sounds a reasonable decision
 aCat: but Detective Pikaptcha EP1 have very large grids
 aCat: but he proobably uses less visuals than me including additional lines, tooltips, etc
 eulerscheZahl: tooltips can be generated in JS too
 eulerscheZahl: also toggles (for a debug view)
 Memo12334: bruh pikaptcha
 wlesavo: yay got MC in C++ working, took me quite long though
 ivandr: Guys, do puzzles have hidden tests
 SPDene: yes
 ivandr: or we see all testcases
 ivandr: ok if yes how many 
 ivandr: where to see the amount
 ivandr: of hidden tests
 SPDene: you deliberately CAN'T see all test cases, to prevent you writing "If (case1), write (answer1)"-type solutions
 SPDene: if you see 5 tests, there will be another (hidden) 5 tests
 Gorbit99: if it's a normal in/out puzzle that is
 ivandr: hmm
 ivandr: ok
 ivandr: maybe bad tested puzzle
 dbdr: cool wlesavo!
 wlesavo: are most of SG top scores from offline or it is possible to get &gt;100k online?
 wlesavo: thx dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: smits and kovi are online
 wlesavo: oh nice
 eulerscheZahl: the odd number in the score is a clear indicator for online sim btw
 wlesavo: smits have some sick rollouts count, i think i have an order of magnitude lower
 eulerscheZahl: mine is really low
 eulerscheZahl: after each change i regenerate all groups
 MSmits: hmm i dont think my rollout count is that great is it?
 wlesavo: well yeah, i do the same and for long testcases i get only 50k rollouts in 20s
 MSmits: lemme test on set 15
 MSmits: 80k in first 20 s.
 wlesavo: oh, so not that many
 MSmits: that's with mcts though, not sure how that affects rollout count compared to MC
 MSmits: might be slower or faster
 wlesavo: i though you said you have around 50k in 50ms
 MSmits: nah
 wlesavo: maybe for a smaller cases
 MSmits: I have a solver, so i almost solve those
 wlesavo: so mine 50k is actually ok, maybe ill try some real algo then
 MSmits: it's not bad
 MSmits: though, maybe my sim could use improvement
 eulerscheZahl: 11845 ms207361 expands
 eulerscheZahl: on testset 15
 Illedan: Online?
 MSmits: mmh, you mean moves played"?
 eulerscheZahl: expand is a single removal of 1 group
 eulerscheZahl: yes, on the CG server
 MSmits: oww
 eulerscheZahl: but my score is offline search
 MSmits: in those metrics I go over a million I think
 wlesavo: oh, it is not a rollouts
 MSmits: lemme count moves played
 Illedan: I count full rolouts
 eulerscheZahl: i don't do MCTS so it makes no sense to give you that number
 Illedan: about 200k in 30 sec
 MSmits: nice
 kovi: 360k in 20sec
 eulerscheZahl: so far kovi wins I think
 aCat: eulerscheZahl thanks for the PR
 eulerscheZahl: you welcome
 aCat: I will try to understand what's inside
 dbdr: is it a trojan?
 aCat: and thanks for giving me hints how project filkes should look like / what to remove
 aCat: I have no damn idea what files java &amp; intellij creates and uses for
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: .idea is your local projectwhich files you have opened and such
 MSmits: btw as for performance. It depends a lot on how you select a move. If you pick a random tile, it's different from when you floodfill every tile and then select a random flood
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't add them to .gitignore and i didn't pay attention, my IDE just replaced some without my intent to do so
 aCat: ah ok
 aCat: fooltip is your version of tooltip?
 eulerscheZahl: so the whole .idea folder should be in gitignore
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i needed a registerTooltip function
 eulerscheZahl: so to add it, I just copied the tooltips file and tweaked it
 eulerscheZahl: and pepped up the naming not to get confused :P
 dbdr: foolpit
 aCat: bleh, normally CG repos are for me, so even storing open IDE tabs seems reasonable for me ;p
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 kovi: the problem is that 2x rollout only gives approx +5%
 eulerscheZahl: you can't expect a double score as the theoretical optimum is probably below 200k
 dbdr: so CPU amount only has negligible impact on optim score?
 dbdr: shocking!
 MSmits: yeah, the leaderboard will be creeping along
 Illedan: xD
 MSmits: biggest creep wins
 dbdr: oOo
 Illedan: WHAAAT can't I solve NP problems faster with more CPU :P
 kovi: so 1k luck factor is more than that
 kovi: or lucky roll on some unbalanced? (set20) case
 MSmits: I doubt luck has much of an effect here
 MSmits: algo &gt; cpu time &gt; luck
 aCat: eulerscheZahl so I need to move everything on JS side, or later can add normal in-java tooltips and stuff?
 aCat: but all the things as constant declarations, etc have to be doubledeclared then
 dbdr: what about the luck to find the right algo?
 dbdr: luck &gt; algo.it's RPS all over again&#160;;)
 MSmits: sure, there is some luck in that, but also not that much&#160;:)
 wlesavo: also luck in choosing the right language
 MSmits: yeah, the best way to choose a language is by wheel of fortune
 dbdr: roll the dice to discover your next language...
 eulerscheZahl: you can combine the JS stuff with the CG SDK
 dbdr: vb.net :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: but it's not possible to create an object in JS and then reference it in Java
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, you will need some code duplication. you could also send the constants to the JS module as well do avoid that. But I think it's not worth the overhead
 eulerscheZahl: the tooltips might be a little tricky as you should use my Fooltip module for it. Otherwise you would see 2 overlapping tooltip windows in some cases
 eulerscheZahl: but i can help with that if needed
 aCat: yeh, I was thinking about that and probably youre right, sending constants as data to module seems stupid
 wlesavo: got +10k by varying a seed lol
 aCat: If fooltip works the same I assume I can use it instead of the old one
 aCat: no reason not to
 MSmits: gj wlesavo&#160;:)
 wlesavo: thats totaly my way of solving prorblems :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: you will have to create a fooltip module on the Java side too
 aCat: aaa
 eulerscheZahl: my copying the official tooltip module and changing 2 or 3 lines
 aCat: hm
 eulerscheZahl: my =&gt; by
 eulerscheZahl: and inject the new module in the referee.java
 aCat: so you don;t have it already done in your projects?
 eulerscheZahl: i have one project with some more JS code. but that would spoil a potential contest
 eulerscheZahl: if you agree to keep your mouth shut and possibly test the game, i can give you access
 aCat: ok, ok, I didn't as for an access , just like it is somewhere so you can copypaste this to me without too much effort
 aCat: changed my mind
 aCat: I am asking for an access
 eulerscheZahl: that makes it easier for me&#160;:)
 aCat: :heart_eyes_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: so no sharing and spoiling, you agreed to these conditions on a public chat
 dbdr: with logs
 aCat: This cat is an honest person
 aCat: trust this one
 Illedan: We know where you live :eyes:
 aCat: no you don't ^^'
 Astrobytes: Cats are people too? :o
 eulerscheZahl: invite sent
 eulerscheZahl: g2g for now
 aCat: thx, cya
 dbdr: people have eyes. cats have eyes. therefore cats are people
 Astrobytes: Astounding logic :D
 dbdr: thx
 dbdr: non distributio medii
 dbdr: even more astounding with such a name, right?
 Astrobytes: I remember this from the logic section of my maths for computer science course
 Astrobytes: Part of me wishes I'd continued down that path rather than biology, but hey ho
 dbdr: you can do CS on CG&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Well I have been learning&#160;;)
 dbdr: TheHolyCommitter was a great random username
 jrke: are there only 30 original testcases in samegame?
 zlatanised: yello
 Memo12334: is it forbidden to ask for someones solution?
 Scarfield: not only is it forbidden, its severally punished :p
 Memo12334: ok bg for me then
 Scarfield: you can ask, if you have already solved the problem yourself, someone might want to share, but dont count on it
 Memo12334: ye probably no one is that generous xd
 Scarfield: having problems with a puzzle?
 Memo12334: yes and for a long time , it drained my brain power 
 Scarfield: which one?
 Memo12334: I can't think clear anymore but I rlly want to solve it before I can live again
 Memo12334: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/detective-pikaptcha-ep2">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/detective-pikaptcha-ep2</a>
 Scarfield: i havent done that one, what approach are you trying?
 MarkAdell: what are the benefits of clash of code chat?
 Scarfield: you can ask for a tip if stuck, and someone might be helpful
 MarkAdell: but the chat isn't present during the round
 Astrobytes: It has a known bug at the moment, where it disappears. Staff are aware, can only apologise in the meantime&#160;:/
 Scarfield: oh didnt know, AstroWise
 Astrobytes: Now you do KnowledgeField
 dbdr: jrke only 20 unique validators
 dbdr: + 20 that are the same with different colors
 kovi: nice improvement msmits. still not local?
 MSmits: no, i just started doing offline
 MSmits: just a bot thats given more time is all
 MSmits: 4 second turns till the end
 MSmits: most of the testcases are the result of just 1 trial run
 MSmits: I think I should be able to get to 140-150 or so if i hang in there
 Scarfield: if you are testing locally, is there any reason to go beyond the first turn, instead of simulating from the first choice untill end, and finding the best sequence that way?
 MSmits: it's nice how submits are much faster with hardcoded solution
 dbdr: :D
 itzblinkzy: i passed all the test cases in clash of code but still got 0%
 itzblinkzy: :pensive:
 itzblinkzy: dunno what i did wrong
 jacek: you didnt invite anyone
 dbdr: esp starting with e
 eulerscheZahl: damn you dbdr, how dare you stealing my 2nd place?
 eulerscheZahl: i have 139k offline. still below you
 dbdr: you mean my 2nd place that you were injustly occupying?
 eulerscheZahl: that's a ridiculous complaint
 dbdr: I'm not the one complaining&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you are the one stealing ranks
 dbdr: *liberating
 eulerscheZahl: do you clear all boards?
 dbdr: I don't record it :D
 eulerscheZahl: :rolling_eyes:
 dbdr: lemme try sth
 dbdr: yes, I clear all
 dbdr: you?
 MSmits: what boards?
 wlesavo: all of them
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 MSmits: I got that part :P
 jacek: tic tac toe boards?
 dbdr: samegame board
 dbdr: s
 dbdr: what else?
 jacek: differentgame boards
 Scarfield: MLP boards
 dbdr: skate boards
 Astrobytes: floor boards
 MSmits: not sure what you mean by clearing though
 eulerscheZahl: i'm one short of clearing all
 Scarfield: removing all tiles
 MSmits: ohh, empty the full board for +1000
 dbdr: yeah
 MSmits: I dont even know
 Scarfield: I suppose there could be a starting board, where you could get a higher score, by grouping more than 35ish tiles and removing them together, but not clearing the entire board
 dbdr: theoretically yes, but 1000 is quite significant
 Scarfield: sure, was just thinking that clearing all boards, might not be the best metric
 dbdr: the best metric is score&#160;:)
 Scarfield: ^&#160;:)
 dbdr: it's still interesting to check it
 Scarfield: yea, i just finished the sim for it, now to decide how to search
 dbdr: it's like that NASCAR video: "our strategy? drive fast!"
 MSmits: mcts it&#160;:)
 MSmits: mcts is easier for single player than for 2 player
 MSmits: because  you dont get the annoying sign bugs
 Scarfield: thats was my first idea, but i think its time to learn about beam search, havent used it before
 MSmits: sure that might work too
 Scarfield: hmm just read the first paragraph explaining beam search. The idea is a lot simpler than i thought it would be, and doesnt seem to be the way for this optim. I understand your "might work" :p
 dbdr: why not?
 MSmits: there are different approaches that might work
 MSmits: the advantage mcts has over beamsearch is detecting long term benefits
 eulerscheZahl: JBM just trolled me :D
 JBM: \o/
 JBM: you may be interested in the way I address assets, btw
 Scarfield: the greedy part of it, it seems to need a very good eval to sort out which choices to leave out
 MSmits: what did he do euler
 MSmits: Scarfield right
 eulerscheZahl: pending contributions MSmits
 JBM: i feel it's a bit cleaner than the "struct way" of posting once, than finding the hashes
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5326e0ad9aaa1c84010096f697c2dc81eee2">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5326e0ad9aaa1c84010096f697c2dc81eee2</a>
 MSmits: kk
 JBM: even in undocumented
 eulerscheZahl: i'll have a look at it. i took the hash-way too
 MSmits: oh no i got RR-ed
 JBM: yes, that's why i mention it
 Astrobytes: ah ffs :D
 JBM: even *if undocumented
 MSmits: sometimes you think it's gone and then every few years it comes back
 jacek: again, no fog of war
 Scarfield: xD
 JBM: there's some around 1'50
 JBM: i think
 eulerscheZahl: webm.setAttribute( 'src', base + assets.images['codingame.webm'] );
 eulerscheZahl: hm, how to use that in the statement?
 JBM: doesn't the statement pick them up directly?
 eulerscheZahl: struct likes to add a lot of images there too
 eulerscheZahl: I don't think so. Never tried tbh
 JBM: it does for league popups
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 JBM: i'd expect it to do so for regular statement as well
 JBM: though i never tried either
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl are you beamsearching samegame or still mc?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, now that I think of it: might work. of course not if i place it in the asset folder :D
 eulerscheZahl: MC beam
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: like MC hammer
 jacek: mr beam
 eulerscheZahl: beam, then MC to change a step, beam from there
 MSmits: mmh bit like mcts 
 eulerscheZahl: and i realized that i have no save routine for during a run
 eulerscheZahl: only when that testcase finished
 MSmits: yeah I me neither
 eulerscheZahl: getting tired but i have a nice score&#160;:(
 MSmits: I need to get a meta mcts going
 MSmits: that's a lot of work though, not sure if i can do that before sunday and run it any useful amount of time
 Scarfield: for samegame?
 eulerscheZahl: blame illedan for the close deadline
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: the cat is already working on the next game
 MSmits: damn felines
 Scarfield: felines before Fra√ºlines
 Scarfield: ah no umlaut&#160;:'(
 MSmits: did you just come up with that one?
 darkhorse64: He wants us to review all literature about NP problems
 MSmits: i dont need to
 Scarfield: nope, saw on reddit somewhere
 dbdr: clicked the preview button on that contribexpecting a 3D toad
 MSmits: they are no problem, problems after all
 MSmits: haha dbdr
 MSmits: you got RR-ed too
 dbdr: RR?
 MSmits: did you click play&gt;
 darkhorse64: Have you read NRPA papers&#160;? Even worse than solver ones
 MSmits: otherwise i will not tell you what it means
 JBM: i think he knows what it means
 dbdr: ah, RR
 dbdr: :D
 Scarfield: "nobody knows what it means, its provocative, gets the people going"
 dbdr: first time it crashed the tab
 JBM: how do i pop out the twitch chat thingy?&#160;:'(
 MSmits: mmh was was nrpa again, it came up the other day
 JBM: shit, there goes my portability&#160;:(
 dbdr: wondered if it was an exploit :D
 JBM: nope, that's a bug
 JBM: my side or CG?
 dbdr: FF, but definition
 dbdr: a tab should not crash
 darkhorse64: Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation. I don't like the idea of streaming inside CG
 MSmits: ahh right that
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/Cfbrcx.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/Cfbrcx.jpg</a>
 MSmits: sometimes these papers about rollout adaptations and selection strategies feel like the researchers are running out of stuff to imrpove about mcts

 MSmits: that sort of thing

 JBM: yeah, did it to me too once
 darkhorse64: The paper claims for more
 JBM: their  asset loading isn't foolproof
 MSmits: hmm ok
 dbdr: #1 at RR&#160;:)
 JBM: shit, i'm not logged in to CG on this box
 JBM: and I forgot my email
 MSmits: damnit, I dont have your login details on this computer either
 darkhorse64: Too hard to code when the beach is nearby
 kovi: uh another hardcoder
 JBM: got it from the mail server
 MSmits: lol, he said too hard to code, not to hardcode :P
 darkhorse64: :ice_cream:
 MSmits: oh darkhorse64, i gave up breakthrough for now. Got lower top 10, but everything I try with params fails
 jacek: aww

 MSmits: I think i need a new eval approach, but i dont feel like it
 darkhorse64: I did for now too. I think I have a performance issue on BT but my code triggers a VS compiler bug and I am unable to profile it
 MSmits: ahh thats annoying
 Scarfield: xD lol dbdr
 darkhorse64: my __builtin_ctlz implementation issues wrong code
 dbdr: use a real compiler then?
 MSmits: damnit I just got RR-ed again
 MSmits: ctz is undefined for 0
 MSmits: might that be your issue?
 dbdr: there's a funky history around that
 MSmits: nooo, no more RR links
 dbdr: a new instruction with the same encoding as the old, but different behaviour on 0
 darkhorse64: Worse than that. The compiler casts my uint64 to 32 bit
 Scarfield: ctlz? isnt it either ctz or clz
 Illedan: RR?
 Scarfield: or just typo
 MSmits: clzl or ctzl
 MSmits: the l  at the end is for 64 bit
 darkhorse64: Sorry, ctzl
 Scarfield: long yea, was just thinking that the typo could somehow be an issue
 MSmits: Illedan click on JBMs new contribution

 MSmits: Rollouts: 418400 
 MSmits: ROOT: visits: 10504216
 MSmits: turn 1
 MSmits: Rollouts: 48736
 MSmits: turn 2
 jacek: rollout = 1 eval?
 dbdr: (who thinks I've edited that wikipedia page with a RR?)
 MSmits: no jacek
 MSmits: thats eval of all children
 MSmits: root visit  is 1 eval
 MSmits: so 10 million of those
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: i dont do random rollout
 MSmits: i expand eval all, backprop
 MSmits: if i would do, say a 5 depth rollout, it would be slower
 MSmits: bot might even be better, but too lazy to try
 RoboStac: darkhorse64 - ctzl is for longs (min 32bit) - ctzll is for long longs (min 64bit)
 jacek: or you just need better eval
 MSmits: yes, but in CG environment ctz is 32 bit and ctzl is 64 bit
 dbdr: for now
 MSmits: I for sure do need better eval to beat tric trac
 RoboStac: yeah, but thats because of the min part of my statement - gcc does 64 bit longs
 MSmits: for you i need better eval and some offline boosting
 MSmits: yeah i know robo
 MSmits: c++ is silly
 MSmits: what other language does this?
 RoboStac: pretty sure c started it
 dbdr: C
 MSmits: ah yeah thats not surprising
 RoboStac: lots of others have variable sized types for some things
 MSmits: oh
 dbdr: lots?
 MSmits: well i dont know so many language so sure
 darkhorse64: My VS code: 
 MSmits: it just seems weird
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff10c12b-ab77-412c-a664-0af71425bb12">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff10c12b-ab77-412c-a664-0af71425bb12</a>
 jacek: int should be int - 32 bits, no more, no less :x
 dbdr: not sure which ones
 MSmits: whats wrong with that darkhorse64
 RoboStac: well, rust / go both do sizes as 32/64 depending on arch
 RoboStac: admittedly at that point I'm running out of examples
 dbdr: rust has u32 and u64 and u128
 RoboStac: yeah, but c++ has uint32_t
 dbdr: and usize for the dependent one
 darkhorse64: The code is correct but the compiler messes with it
 MSmits: u128 is nice
 MSmits: did you know C# actually sort of has u128
 MSmits: it's called Guid
 dbdr: uint32_t is ugly enough that it does not get used much
 RoboStac: c++ just makes it really awkward by automatically converting between things
 RoboStac: so  you suddenly lose some bits and have no idea why because your constant 1 was actually a 32 bit int 
 MSmits: well at first you dont even know you lost some bits
 dbdr: it loses bits silently? :O
 MSmits: that's the first hour of debugging
 darkhorse64: Basically, it ignores the upper 32 bits in a 64 bits int
 RoboStac: yeah - easiest mistake in bitshifting is to do uint64_t y = (1 &lt;&lt; x);
 MSmits: it gets worse when you only lose the bits with optimization on
 RoboStac: and if x is &gt; 32 you get 0
 MSmits: happens to me a lot RoboStac
 darkhorse64: It used to work with previous VS versions
 Scarfield: have done that as well
 Astrobytes: I know that error well
 dbdr: java is reasonable in only converting silently when it does not lose information
 MSmits: C# also
 MSmits: i dont think it ever converts silently
 dbdr: in rust it's always explicit
 dbdr: I guess if we need something unreasonable we always have C++ :D
 MSmits: it's so crazy what it lets you do
 dbdr: long x = my_int;
 dbdr: that's silent conversion
 MSmits: oh hmm
 dbdr: in Java/C#
 RoboStac: you just need to enable all the warnings + the extra ones + the even more extra ones and then a few more and it'll tell you about these things though
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c47e4f7-f427-43ba-a0d8-b857dff0482a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3c47e4f7-f427-43ba-a0d8-b857dff0482a</a>
 MSmits: your VS is bugged
 MSmits: it speaks French
 dbdr: :scream:
 MSmits: lemme show you what i did darkhorse64, maybe you can just steal that?
 RoboStac: for what line of code darkhorse64?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba761d9a-dcd8-41a3-9fe0-2ecf2af94263">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba761d9a-dcd8-41a3-9fe0-2ecf2af94263</a>
 darkhorse64: Actually, hard to tell because everything is inlined but, looking at the ASM, I see that BitScanReverse is translated to ctz_helper. The error message says that the helper is called with a 32 bit argument cast from the 64 bit
 RoboStac: because that warnings exactly what you should get for passing a uint64_t into __builtin_ctzl
 MSmits: I do that all the time
 MSmits: am I not supposed to?
 dbdr: ll for 64
 MSmits: I guess ll for 64 bit guaranteed
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: but on CG just l works right?
 darkhorse64: You mean that __builtin_ctzl is part of VS library&#160;?
 MarkAdell: is codingame open source?
 MSmits: MarkAdell no
 MSmits: but you can contribute puzzles and games
 MSmits: that part is open source
 darkhorse64: And that my implementation is shadowed&#160;? That would explain everything
 MSmits: also when they write a bot game for you to make bots for, they ahre the referee, thats sort of open source
 MSmits: share that is
 MSmits: so I guess parts of it are open source

 darkhorse64: darkhorse64 is my ChessBase nick
 dbdr: 64 bit shorts, nice :D
 MSmits: ah ok, then your VS just doesnt like it somehow...
 darkhorse64: I think he does not like that I call my function __builtin_ctzl
 MSmits: me neither
 darkhorse64: Great. An explanation and a workaround
 darkhorse64: Problem solved
 MSmits: cookl
 MSmits: -k
 darkhorse64: anyone can cook&#160;?
 MSmits: not me
 Zenoscave: I can
 Astrobytes: I can
 Zenoscave: I cook frozen dinners all the time
 darkhorse64: scrambled eggs is nothing for someone versed in MonteCarlo
 MSmits: thats called defrosting Zenoscave
 Astrobytes: When I wasn't vegetarian my cassoulet was legendary
 Zenoscave: oh. does it count as cooking if i don't use a microwave?
 MSmits: sure
 Zenoscave: then i'm a "cook"
 dbdr: Astrobytes: couldn't you adapt to a veg version?
 Astrobytes: Of course dbdr, but then it's just not cassoulet&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Just beans.
 MSmits: wait, vegetarians can still cook meat cant they?
 MSmits: I thought it was about eating it
 Astrobytes: Yes. I have to sometimes.
 dbdr: "virgin bloody mary"
 MSmits: then it's still legendary isnt it?
 MSmits: thats a sheldon quote dbdr
 dbdr: yep
 Astrobytes: Not if I can't eat it
 dbdr: the "vegetarian cassoulet is just beans" reminded me of it&#160;:)
 MSmits: mmh ok, but isnt legendary by definiton about other people&#160;?
 MSmits: dbdr yeah makes sense
 Astrobytes: And quite frankly, I'm not about to go to the effort of making cassoulet for a couple of family members when I cannot eat it.
 darkhorse64: I tried meat but I did not inhale it
 Astrobytes: That and there's no French market here anyway&#160;:/
 dbdr: I think it would be strange for a vegetarian to work in a slaughterhouse
 dbdr: it's not just about eating
 Zenoscave: having trouble with agitc
 Astrobytes: Obviously.
 Zenoscave: gitc*
 Astrobytes: I was a highly carnivorous chef once upon a time.
 jacek: cats are quite carnivorous anyway
 Astrobytes: And I resent having to cook meat, which is why I do it for relatives only. At a push.
 Astrobytes: On special occasions.
 Astrobytes: Still love the smell and taste of it (if it's good stuff), but that's it.
 dbdr: really? how long have you been vegetarian?
 dbdr: I experienced it fades away with time
 Astrobytes: About 2.5 years I think?
 Astrobytes: I detest the smell of poor quality meat/meat products. Which is most of what you get in supermarkets etc.
 dbdr: but yes, I can imagine it's different if it's right there and very good quality
 Astrobytes: Some of the high quality stuff I've tasted I couldn't afford outside of a pro kitchen, and it's fantastic. Won't eat it now though.
 dbdr: is quality going to get even worse outside the EU?
 Zenoscave: dbdr have you tried running the ocaml in your bio?
 Astrobytes: *Wouldn't
 Astrobytes: Yes, I think so.
 dbdr: Zenoscave: I don't think so, wrote out of memory. is it wrong?
 Astrobytes: Loosening of regulations etc.
 Zenoscave: I think so. 
 Zenoscave: my ocaml is weak though
 dbdr: yeah, probably does not work for data
 dbdr: my ocaml is rusty :D
 dbdr: but you get the idea
 Zenoscave: I do&#160;;)
 dbdr: Astrobytes: maybe Scotland will join?&#160;;)

 Javatacos: can you torpedo and trigger same turn?
 Javatacos: also when does the game calculate whether the torpedo is within range.  before or after move?
 Insta-x: torpedo range is calculated when you shoot, so your range with be different before nd after move
 Javatacos: cool thank you
 Insta-x: torpedo and trigger is unrelated, so you can do both command in one turn
 metahom: but what happens first if u launch torpedo and move on the same turn?
 Zenoscave: depends on which you do first.
 Zenoscave: torpedo or move
 Zenoscave: they are evaluated in order of commands given
 metahom: i see. thanks
 Csipcsirip: hm isnt it possible to jump over on visited cells with silence&#160;? 
 Csipcsirip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443025867">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443025867</a>
 Csipcsirip: i dont know what " (not visiting already visited cells or islands)" means then..
 Csipcsirip: ahh okay I understand it now :D 
 Zenoscave: Csipcsirip no
 Csipcsirip: yes I see it know. I had to overcomplicate my whole code to handle that case...
 eulerscheZahl: it's the same questions getting asked over and over again
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl how's your bot
 Csipcsirip: maybe the rule statements are not 100% clear :p 
 Zenoscave:  cells in a given direction (not visiting already visited cells or islands)
 Zenoscave: clear to me&#160;;)
 Csipcsirip: for me... it was not :D 
 eulerscheZahl: i just started Zenoscave
 eulerscheZahl: give me a day or 2
 Zenoscave: You just started?
 eulerscheZahl: i have some tracking logic
 eulerscheZahl: and a stupid if-else to somehow use it
 Zenoscave: ok
 Zenoscave: That's all I have...
 eulerscheZahl: but the brain part of my but is missing completely
 accorp: your but has a brain?
 accorp: no wonder you're so good
 eulerscheZahl: these letters are really close together on the keyboard
 Zenoscave: oui
 eulerscheZahl: and i never learned proper 10 finger typing
 Zenoscave: Neither did Kernighan nor Ritchie
 eulerscheZahl: and then they decided to torture those who did with fancy simbols
 eulerscheZahl: i always have to look where to find some of them
 eulerscheZahl: while i can find the letters blindly at least
 Zenoscave: fancy symbols like {} and []?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Zenoscave: C# may be a bit heavy on those
 eulerscheZahl: a hell to type on a german keyboard
 Zenoscave: I can imagine
 eulerscheZahl: and \ for latex
 Zenoscave: you do a lot of Latex?
 eulerscheZahl: not anymore
 eulerscheZahl: we have an AltGr key on the right of the space bar
 eulerscheZahl: press that together with 7 and you get {
 Zenoscave: I'm aware
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Zenoscave: Been (mis)fortunate enough to need a keyboard like that 
 Zenoscave: Not a fan
 eulerscheZahl: and all of that just because of äöüß
 Zenoscave: at least you don't have ø
 Zenoscave: ¥†®´∑œå∂ƒ©˙∆˚
 eulerscheZahl: i guess Illedan has that
 Zenoscave: I hate apple keyboards for this
 eulerscheZahl: i only have those: @ł€¶ŧ←↓→øþæſðđŋħł|»«¢„“”µ·…–
 eulerscheZahl: for some i don't even know what they are good for
 Zenoscave: some are old english or saxonish
 Zenoscave: a few physics symbols I see as well
 SilentKnightFromAfar_d6e: ...
 eulerscheZahl: and that's a linux keyboard thing. i wouldn't find them on windows
 Zenoscave: lol windows alt codes make me ill
 Zenoscave: think you'll sim this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: not completely
 eulerscheZahl: uncertainty + high branching
 Zenoscave: right
 eulerscheZahl: you get somewhat get around the branching with a MC search
 Zenoscave: probably just gonna sim combat in close quarters
 eulerscheZahl: worked quite well for C4L
 Zenoscave: MC search for C4L eh?
 eulerscheZahl: but the incomplete information will be a pain
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i'm ranked 3rd in the multi right now with it
 Zenoscave: huh
 Zenoscave: thanks for the idea. I assume you mean true MC search not MCTS? or am I mistaken

 Zenoscave: thanks
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl US-international is a good layout for programming I think
 dbdr: [] directly, {} with shift, not alt-gr madness&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but then i have to relearn it and the marks on my keyboard don't find the content
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: or get a US keyboard next time&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and when i buy a new keyboard, i have to buy another one for my office desk
 eulerscheZahl: and the laptop...
 dbdr: I can still type accents when needed, but it's secondary for me
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even care about öäü that much
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: but when i use someone elses keyboard, it will get weird
 dbdr: german has qwertz&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 JFB: z &lt;-&gt; y on german keyboard&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 dbdr: same for hungarian, probably because of german influence
 JFB: In "official" polish keyboard it exactly the same. But nobody use "official" polish keyboard
 eulerscheZahl: historically you wanted letters next to each other, that aren't used in normal words directly after each other
 eulerscheZahl: from type writer letters getting stuck by fast typing
 dbdr: I think that's still true
 dbdr: faster to type if you alternate hands
 dbdr: maybe
 dbdr: I might be wrong
 dbdr: close might be good, far but same hand bad
 dbdr: or not&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: just explaining the y-zas german is a different language
 eulerscheZahl: English has a lot of y, german doesn't
 aCat: eulerscheZahl was there any stream concerning ocean of code?
 eulerscheZahl: there's a #stream channel on discord, check there
 eulerscheZahl: personally i don't care, so i muted it :D
 aCat: great - thanks for reminding me!
 aCat: I didn't mute it but as I have thousends of unread stuff on cg discord it "blends in" quite nicely :P
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Uljahn: meow
 Csipcsirip: :angry:
 eulerscheZahl: why so angry?
 Csipcsirip: becaus of that cat
 eulerscheZahl: did i miss anything?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the dog avatar
 struct: How many states do you end up until end game usually?
 struct: Is the number big?
 eulerscheZahl: hard to answer, as it depends on your overall behavior (e.g. SONAR usage)
 accorp: lol, a player surfaced and shoot a torpedo in same move, so that I would think he was damaged by it... I can't decide if that's clever or just dirty
 eulerscheZahl: you see the SURFACE in his last commands
 eulerscheZahl: so your tracker just sucks
 struct: what would you say
 struct: worst csae
 struct: 1 mill+?
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's 3-4k maybebut with sonar
 accorp: could you not be an as*hole? I know I can see it
 struct: what?
 accorp: euler
 Csipcsirip: do you track possible paths or just possible positions euler&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: both
 eulerscheZahl: why the hate, what did i do wrong?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, "so your tracker just sucks"now i remember
 Uljahn: the chat seems a bit sensitive atm
 Zenoscave: maybe you're sensitive Uljahn
 Zenoscave: jk jk meow
 Zenoscave: happy caturday
 Uljahn: pewpew
 eulerscheZahl: oh deari'm the wrong person to keep chatting when others get easily offended
 Zenoscave: PEW PEW
 AntiSquid: should have used the more common "FIX IT" line
 Zenoscave: maybe you should fix it
 AntiSquid: ok accorp fix your tracker, eulerscheZahl fix your fix it statement, ok i will try to fix my tracker later Zenoscave
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: I fixed something but I'm not sure what
 AntiSquid: accidentally squashed a bug&#160;?
 Zenoscave: a big one apparently
 struct: or created one
 Zenoscave: how so?
 aCat: You do some normal 'search' in this game or just symething like one-ply deep or rule-based stuff?
 Zenoscave: filter popssible positions
 Zenoscave: state based right now
 Zenoscave: maybe a few top players sim
 kovi: nice csipcsirip!

 eulerscheZahl: woof
 YannT: I like bots who give their detection in messages
 YannT: good for debugging against
 kovi: yeah, it helped in the beginning
 kovi: now everyone of us have the same bugs&#160;:)
 struct: your enemy detection is bugged?
 eulerscheZahl: not anymore i guess
 Tunga: Greetings my lords!
 YannT: I don't think I've got detection bugs?
 YannT: except the assumption that people won't shoot themselves, because yeah we've all got that one
 MSmits: not me
 struct: I think you should take that into account
 struct: imo
 YannT: you can't if you think about it
 MSmits: sure you can
 MSmits: you know where the explosion happened
 MSmits: you know how much damage he got
 YannT: your only options are make the assumptions (for now, true almost all the time), or just not deduce if say both players have a torpedo action on the same turn
 MSmits: you know where you shot
 MSmits: you save that
 MSmits: then you take his order
 YannT: no you can't because you don't know the split of damage between your torpedo and theirs or if they shot themselves before or after moving
 MSmits: add up the damage to a damage map
 MSmits: filter possible position
 YannT: so you don't know how to decude that properly
 MSmits: sure you know that
 MSmits: you know the order of the opponent orders
 MSmits: so you know if he moved first or not
 YannT: it could be your torperdo hitting, or theirs, and theirs could be before or after move
 MSmits: so allow both options
 MSmits: you use the damage as a position filter
 YannT: and between 1 or 2 damages, it could be any combination of possibilities
 MSmits: not any, just very few
 YannT: yeah you could allow all of them, but that's equal to not decuding&#160;:)
 MSmits: you simply consider them all
 MSmits: no it;s not
 YannT: meaning, you don't actually deduce
 MSmits: you allow all *possible* combinations
 YannT: which is your entire space to begin with!
 MSmits: so you fully deduce it as far as is possible
 MSmits: no it's not
 MSmits: you know where the explosions happened
 MSmits: so why would it be the entire space
 YannT: it hit or it didn't = no deducing from that
 struct: cant you deduce if you dont hit aswell?
 YannT: you just do the fire position deduction
 YannT: but nothing from damage taken
 YannT: so back to what I said, you can either make the assumption, or not deduce if both players fired/triggered on the same turn
 YannT: (unless they didn't lose any live)
 MSmits: YannT you seem to say that since there are multiple positions on the map where he could take 1 damage, you can't deduce anything, but surely you can deduce he isn't anywhere else but those positions?
 MSmits: isnt that a good thing?
 MSmits: I don't see the problem
 MSmits: I do allow for the possibility he will shoot himself and that will simply mean a few more possible positions
 MSmits: not that many
 MSmits: the alternative is making a wrong assumption and completely messing up your tracking when he *does* shoot himself
 MSmits: thats way way worse
 YannT: I'm saying in a case when the opponent lost life, and fired a torpedo, and they fired a torpedo, if you don't wanna assume that they won't shoot themselves, you cannot deduce position from the damage taken, because it could be your torpedo or their torpedo hitting, and because they could have fired their torpedo before or after moving, allowing for all the poissibilities ends up not trimming anything
 MSmits: thats not true, it still trims a lot
 MSmits: it's a 15 by 15 map
 YannT: decuding from the firing position does yeah, damage doesn't
 MSmits: it's only a 3 by 3 blast
 MSmits: the blast is less than 5% of the map
 MSmits: who cares that instead of 5% of the map you get 7-8% of the map
 YannT: you don't have all of the map as possibilities typically when firing torpedoes
 MSmits: of course not, but you will be removing all the remote locations
 MSmits: the way i do it i dont even think about all those possible combinations and options
 MSmits: i just create a damage map, compare with opponent damage and filter cells
 MSmits: the only annoying part is moving the map with the opponent orders (shifting the damage map_
 wlesavo: MSmits seems to be the only correct way
 jacek: smitsisonar
 wlesavo: smitsishootin
 MSmits: I'm not saying there isn't some value in assuming the opponent doesnt shoot himself, there is a good chance it's correct and then you filter more. The alternative is just annoying, ending up with an empty map of possible positions, not knowing how to continue
 wlesavo: stands for exposing yourself in 3 shoots :slight_smile:
 MSmits: yeah :P
 MSmits: blasterpoard convinced me to try and make a silence pruning function today
 kovi: smitsilence then
 MSmits: lol no... I just felt stupid watching illedans bot kill me by chain silence
 MSmits: even after I shot him 3 times and was at full life
 MSmits: even vs bronze boss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443066602">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443066602</a>
 kovi: yeah, some days it was fun getting to top10 basicly by silence only
 MSmits: I get 2385 paths
 MSmits: to 6 positions at the end
 YannT: "i just create a damage map, compare with opponent damage and filter cells" I do the same&#160;:)
 wlesavo: there were a couple of such bots in bronze, dunno if it is gonna be relevant later, but some one can still abuse it against you
 MSmits: Yeah, you need a state-filter regardless
 MSmits: they can also explode your state-space with mines
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2jDPgvbTY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2jDPgvbTY</a>
 YannT: I actually have half a mind to make a tricky thing where I intentionally shoot myself on the turn I get torpedoes and it doesn't do any damage to empty their positions list and screw them over&#160;:)
 MSmits: well that one won't work on me :P
 YannT: I think most if not all of the current bots would be screwed by that :D
 YannT: you can tell anyway by the numbers in the comments of the bots who do that that they all  make the assumption
 MSmits: nice
 eulerscheZahl: you would actually help my bot detecting you by shooting yourself
 kovi: tha is also on my list
 AntiSquid: even my bot checks who shot the torpedo and what caused the damage 
 kovi: trigger a mine
 kovi: but you can tell
 kovi: cant
 YannT: you would do this only when your list of possible positions is small to empty it
 MSmits: if you trigger a mine you can still tell which positions give 1 or 2 damage and filter appropriately
 YannT: I know that would screw me over
 MSmits: you know where both mine and torpedo exploded
 AntiSquid: 1 or 8 cells
 MSmits: but sure, with bad assumptions you could be screwed
 YannT: 90% of bots in that case assume their torpedo or mine did the damage, not yours&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: then they need to FIX IT
 MSmits: yeah, I'm sure it works, but it's better to try to compete with the best bots I think
 YannT: they might have a safeguard against empty lists tho, so you would need to do it when there's like 10-20 possibilities remaining so it seems legit and they will work off a screwed up list for many turns
 accorp: MSmits, what if you shoot and trigger a mine, and the op takes 2 dmg?
 MSmits: then there will be several positions where he took 2 damage
 AntiSquid: mines don't get triggered by torpedo anymore do they?
 MSmits: and you only consider those positions to be possible
 accorp: oh, just 3 positions
 YannT: never did
 eulerscheZahl: they never got AntiSquid
 MSmits: do mines trigger eachother?
 YannT: nope
 AntiSquid: no?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 MSmits: ok, never done mines yet
 MSmits: so was wondering
 MSmits: good... that makes it possible to do a perfect damage filter
 AntiSquid: accorp you need to change that part in your code
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cba6b988-aecc-4859-8a6a-00f7481f0f3a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cba6b988-aecc-4859-8a6a-00f7481f0f3a</a>
 YannT: my next TODO is a probabilistic mine location filter of some sort so avoid moving where there's likely mines
 YannT: that's gonna be a subtle balance to strike
 MSmits: thats far down my list, so many other things to do&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: like onitama :D
 YannT: between not going into likely mines, updating mine possibilities after triggers, and also not going into islands trying to avoid mines :o
 MSmits: no, i meant my ooc list&#160;:(
 MSmits: I wanted to do onitama though
 wlesavo: YannT actually did just that yeasterday, minimizing possible damage from mines
 MSmits: and suddenly I got uttt ideas too, so i did some of that the last few days :P
 YannT: it's my last feature TODO, after that the next one literally say  "simulate stuff"
 struct: meanwhile you lost rank 1 on yavalath
 MSmits: are you kidding me
 struct: yes&#160;:)
 wlesavo: :grinning:
 MSmits: giving me a :heart: attack
 AntiSquid: :broken_heart:
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: then i know the right puzzle for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators</a>
 MSmits: solved it
 wlesavo: so you safe against the heart attacks
 YannT: yavalath sounds like MCTS city no?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 struct: yes and no
 jacek: ohboy
 YannT: you could take your UTTT, rework the data structure and have a thing :D
 struct: vanilla mcts wont do well
 MSmits: a thing?
 YannT: a bot that works
 jacek: vanilla?
 MSmits: plain mcts on Yavalath is super weak yes
 YannT: why so?
 struct: traps
 MSmits: your bot will try to avoid killing itself by randoming 3 in a row
 MSmits: not traps
 MSmits: at first it's just gonna be putting hexes on edges
 MSmits: because those have the least chance to make 3 in a row
 MSmits: and kill yourself
 YannT: ahh I see
 jacek: i thought vanilla would include 1-ply check in the sim&#160;:?
 MSmits: well depends on your definition of vanilla
 MSmits: most wont start with a 1-ply check
 MSmits: especially coming from uttt
 MSmits: uttt is just, random everything, get good performance -&gt; legend
 struct: I forgot I cant update yavalath
 struct: and add boss
 MSmits: did you want another league?
 MSmits: get lvl 30
 struct: Yes, but still not many players
 eulerscheZahl: even i can update yavalath :D
 struct: was 96 players last time I checked
 YannT: 1-ply check = check if you can set up a win in two moves with a 2+1&#160;?
 MSmits: no, check if your bot suicides on that particular random move
 MSmits: and pick a different random move
 MSmits: so filter all loss locations
 MSmits: in the random sim
 jacek: make a winning move if can, avoid losing move
 MSmits: yeah do the wins too
 MSmits: gradually making the sim heavier makes your bot a lot better
 emh: I lost my motivation for Ocean of Code.. and we're only in second week. maybe I should rewrite in an obscure language
 YannT: I don't understand why the bot would make a random 3 line as that would be a lost anyway in the MCTS results
 jacek: in a sim
 YannT: ahhh
 MSmits: if you're going to do random moves and check for win, you're often going to suicide
 YannT: okay got it
 MSmits: way more than actually winning
 YannT: so the random sims don't end in silly ways
 jacek: itll be slower, ut smarter
 MSmits: so 95% of losses will not be because someone made 4 in a row, but because the other guy made 3
 YannT: got it, make the random sims more relevant&#160;:)
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: taking a break before trying to write some state-pruning code
 YannT: I need to do mine probabilities :o
 MSmits: go go&#160;:)
 YannT: and move away from  probable mines without going into islands
 ToshiTuringMachine: any easy way to create an hamiltonian path?
 accorp: YannT, if you take the move that reveals you the least, wouldn't that be achieved naturally?
 YannT: it's NP-complete so no
 YannT: reveals the last&#160;!= avoiding going where there's maybe mines
 accorp: I mean the island thing
 YannT: I mean if you avoid the mines too hard, you might screw your pathing or force a surface
 YannT: there's a balance there
 eulerscheZahl: why do you even want a hamlitonian path ToshiTuringMachine?
 eulerscheZahl: will make it easier for the opponent to track you
 ToshiTuringMachine: so if you see someone doing half hamiltonian path you predict him to continue the same way?
 YannT: long straight lines are bad for detection
 YannT: be the snail
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah the snail is an hamilt path
 wlesavo: to catch a snail you need to think like a snail

 wlesavo: sure it does
 Uljahn: illegal commands are substituted by surface?
 AntiSquid: ah yes lol
 wlesavo: "SURFACE|MOVE " + to_string(x) + " " + to_string(y) + " TORPEDO"
 AntiSquid: the x y shouldn't be there anyway
 MSmits: why not?
 MSmits: Surface
 AntiSquid: because you don't surface x y
 MSmits: you do
 wlesavo: just SURFACE
 AntiSquid: where does it say you teleport to x y&#160;?
 Uljahn:  If you fail to output a valid action, you will SURFACE in that turn. 
 wlesavo: everything else done by refere
 MSmits: wait, surface is completely random?
 AntiSquid: MSmits your output is wrong
 AntiSquid: no
 MSmits: well random from visited cells ofc
 MSmits: but still random
 RoboStac: no, its where you are
 wlesavo: MSmits sectors mean 1..9
 MSmits: I know this, I am not talking about opponent surface
 MSmits: I am talking about my own surface
 RoboStac: you just surface without changing position
 MSmits: do i have any control over where I surface?
 Uljahn: no
 MSmits: ohhhhh
 wlesavo: what do you mean random
 AntiSquid: and also you can't MOVE x y 
 MSmits: I completely misread the text
 Insta-x: yes, i you intentionally surface
 MSmits: By using surface you will reset your path of visited cells so that you can freely move to a cell that you have previously visited.
 MSmits: I thought it said you teleported to a cell you've previously visited
 Uljahn: ahh
 wlesavo: lol
 YannT: ohh
 Insta-x: lol
 MSmits: it can be read that way
 YannT: that would be handy ahah
 AntiSquid: no it just clears your path
 wlesavo: spece ocean
 ToshiTuringMachine: propose it as a legend league added rule
 Insta-x: that would make the game longer lol
 MSmits: well that makes things simpler I suppose
 wlesavo: sure
 AntiSquid: that would make silence look far less outrageous than it is i guess
 Insta-x: yes lol
 MSmits: ok, so subs cant teleport all over the map, got it!
 Insta-x: everytime your enemy surface, you will have to track him again from zero
 wlesavo: smitsiLence
 AntiSquid: Insta-x no, you get the sector
 MSmits: yeah I got that
 Insta-x: no, its if what MSmits said true
 MSmits: I knew it from the opponent point of view. I just misread the text saying it would allow you to teleport
 MSmits:  I thought you could teleport and then the opponent would know which sector you picked
 Insta-x: we know, we are just playing what if, i think
 MSmits: this is going to make my todo list a lot shorter :P
 MSmits: I had "find good spots to surface at" in there
 AntiSquid: but you got more issues in there MSmits AddOrder("SURFACE " + to_string(x) + " " + to_string(y) + " TORPEDO"); why is there x and y&#160;?
 MSmits: i just explained
 MSmits: I thought it was a teleport to specific cell previously visited
 MSmits: so I was trying to teleport
 AntiSquid: ah but you don't use that for MOVE do you&#160;?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: string dir = GetDirection(posX, posY, x, y);
 MSmits: AddOrder("MOVE " + dir + " TORPEDO");
 MSmits: surface so rarely happens in my games that I never noticed this crazy misconception :P
 eulerscheZahl: you can even surface on purpose to make SILENT more effective
 MSmits: and get damage
 eulerscheZahl: but little
 MSmits: that would only be worth it if you expect your opponent to time out because of it?
 MSmits: if he has no pruning
 eulerscheZahl: if you expect to get hit by a torpedo as well
 MSmits: so, you surface, then silence
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 YannT: there's for sure a balance to be found with surfacing when all other remaining options "suck", for some difinition of sucking
 YannT: maximize your possible positions, not walk into a mine field, reset the available tiles while silence is available...
 MSmits: you have a const float SUCK_TRESHOLD in your code don't you Yannt
 YannT: I call it a score but yeah :p
 AntiSquid: how do you even accurately detect mines?
 YannT: accurately you don't
 eulerscheZahl: guesstimation
 Insta-x: ooh, is it a GA?
 YannT: you can know where there's maybe possibly mines and evaluate wether it's worth risking it or not (that's my next feature)
 AntiSquid: so how does the opponent guess it's time to detonate a mine?
 MSmits: when he knows where you are
 MSmits: that happens a lot
 YannT: that's easier, it's like torpedoes
 AntiSquid: just blow it up to reduce possibilities?
 Insta-x: wait, if you surface then silence, it could make your opponents silence pruning timeout?
 MSmits: if I look at my games, I often know where the opponent is
 YannT: well you can be more liberal with mines because it doesn't give your position away, but you still want to get some value out of them
 MSmits: unless they chain silence
 ZarthaxX: you cant catch me smito
 ZarthaxX: im a shadow
 MSmits: Yannt it can give your position away actually
 MSmits: if you blow up a mine, your opponent knows where the mine was
 YannT: if one assumes you don't self damage, we've been over this :p
 Insta-x: you sure we cant track you with mine?
 AntiSquid: noob rank ZarthaxX
 MSmits: he can then deduce where you where when you dropped it
 YannT: no
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid ban
 YannT: it's 4 possibilities times the number of possible positions at that time
 Astrobytes: BanthaxX
 ZarthaxX: astrobyto&#160;!
 MSmits: he can prune all paths that did not pass by a mine
 ZarthaxX: hi
 Astrobytes: hey man
 MSmits: in that location
 ZarthaxX: MSmits is correct
 AntiSquid: i will report you ZarthaxX
 Insta-x: i dont know, cuz i just wanted to implement it
 YannT: and with people doing the snail, there might ever be several possibilities for laying out a mine in a given path
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid aight
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes how is the corona?
 MSmits: Yannt not saying it's easy, I am saying it's possible 
 YannT: I guess you can get some value out of it yess
 YannT: it's probably litte tho
 ZarthaxX: it's huge
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX looks like US will be hit the hardest in the long run
 Astrobytes: STill feeling a bit meh ZarthaxX but a lot better. Need to go supermarket today
 Insta-x: its pretty similar with silence pruning i think, at least its similar with my silence pruning algo
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid US is rank 1 by far, not smth proud to be about&#160;:/
 MSmits: yeah, one might wonder if this has something to do with people listening to a mentally unstable president AntiSquid
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes nice, and your mom?
 Astrobytes: She's not too good ZarthaxX, still keeping an eye on it, no worse but no better either
 YannT: MSmits: might be a feature idea actually, I guess it would indeed be worth something to run all paths and check if they allowed for that mine to be laid, but I don't know if it's going to prune enough to be worth the time cost
 MSmits: me neither YannT, but I it's on my list
 Insta-x: i think its worth it?
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes&#160;:( hope she goes through this shit
 MSmits: yeah Astrobytes
 Insta-x: if we could prune almost everything, our enemy cant escape with silence
 YannT: typically everybody moves in a snail manner, so at any point most of your possible paths probably cross that mine, and especially if a silence was used
 Astrobytes: Me too ZarthaxX man, everyone healthy on your side?
 MSmits: most people come through ok thankfully
 Astrobytes: Yeah MSmits, she's got high blood pressure tho' underlying condition and all that
 Insta-x: my bot dont go in a snail pattern lol
 ZarthaxX: yeah we are ok, been inside the house for weeks
 ZarthaxX: went out for shopping only
 Astrobytes: Cool. Doing that shortly myself
 MSmits: YannT not just "crossing the path" also crossing it at the point in time when a mine was laid there
 Astrobytes: Considering wearing my respirator mask for shits and giggles
 MSmits: I get confused in the supermarket
 AntiSquid: i had a random dry cough for few days after i started working from home, but that's about it, might as well pretend it was the common cold
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes never wore one, dont know how effective it is..
 ZarthaxX: but i guess it helps stop the spread
 MSmits: I need to pay so much attention to people staying away from me I  forget to take some groceries out of the card and stuff like that
 MSmits: it's quite stressful
 YannT: MSmits: very interesting  actually&#160;:)
 jacek: youre physics teacher. dont people already stay away from you?
 Insta-x: i havent go out since the quarantine started lol
 MSmits: hahahahahahaha :P
 AntiSquid: should wear his badge
 Astrobytes: No I'd just wear the mask for a laugh, I use it for DIY stuff, sanding paint/varnished surfaces etc. The filter covers viruses too, would scare the shit outta everyone
 YannT: but, at this point detection isn't really a primary concern anyway, it's 
 ZarthaxX: looool jacek
 YannT: good enough that I pretty much know where the ennemy is
 YannT: MSmits: silence does screw up the "point in time" aspect actually
 MSmits: yeah Yannt, just spreading ideas 
 Insta-x: well yes, i think strategy and resource management is more worth it
 Astrobytes: Spread ideas not viruses
 YannT: because of silence your possible paths will have different lengths
 YannT: so probably can't do that
 YannT: or also keep track of "silence time"
 MSmits: it depends a lot on how you model silence
 YannT: in each path
 MSmits: when i said time, I didn't mean time exactly 
 Insta-x: silence time? what does that mean?
 MSmits: when you split a silence into possible movement locations, you also get possible mine locations
 MSmits: and if a mine did not explode into any of those possible locations, the entire path is impossible
 YannT: well if you wanna backtrack a path to know where someone was at a given turn, you also need to keep track of the steps in silence not costing any turns
 MSmits: I don't backtrack, I bitboard the entire path and possible origins
 MSmits: dont use lists and all that
 MSmits: everything is a bitboard
 AntiSquid: overall it's more about guesswork, since silence covers too much of the possible map
 emh: what I did in the end I keep track of possible end locations, with list of possible parents, then in the end I validate non-self-intersecting paths using the parents
 Astrobytes: Coming soon, MSmits SC2 bot, bitboarded
 Insta-x: i use lists MSmits hehe, what is bitboard?
 Insta-x: is it in python?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44ccd3de-b7fb-4f85-a0ae-40c9751d2558">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44ccd3de-b7fb-4f85-a0ae-40c9751d2558</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it's a language agnostic idea
 AntiSquid: you use bits to represent data Insta-x
 MSmits: this is sector 1 in bitboard
 Insta-x: like a bitmasks?
 MSmits: yes
 Insta-x: is it in python?
 eulerscheZahl: i feel ignored
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl 02:14PMit's a language agnostic idea
 Insta-x: cuz i use list to represent the bitbard using True and False lol
 ZarthaxX: that's how noobs that talk here feel everyday eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: At least I paid attention :P
 AntiSquid: Insta-x <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-bitset-and-its-application/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-bitset-and-its-application/</a> good start
 Insta-x: ooo thx
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i didnt think it merited a response, it was perfectly descriptive and clear
 Insta-x: thx eulerscheZahl
 YannT: I don't know how you "bitboard a path", you would need the ordering not just visited locations?
 Insta-x: didnt pay attention :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: not ignored by you MSmits&#160;;)
 MSmits: no, the ordering doesnt matter
 MSmits: you just keep the visited places
 MSmits: and as you build that up
 YannT: true, but it does if you want to do the "point in time" thing
 Insta-x: yep ZarthaxX
 MSmits: you also build up a possible mine map
 MSmits: so each time you add a mine to this possible mine map, you know where you are path-wise
 MSmits: at that point in "time" 
 MSmits: i was thinking about using a uint32_t for this
 Insta-x: i dont bitboard the path, its too memory and performance intensive
 MSmits: so i have 4 bits per cell
 MSmits: (4 neighbors)
 AntiSquid: Insta-x read the link ...
 MSmits: the problem with storing the path is that it shifts, so you need to move the path around
 MSmits: the path is relative to the origin after all
 YannT: but the trigger will be many turns later, so how do you "go back" if you have no ordering to say that this was the turn the mine was laid and these are the paths at that time that were possible
 MSmits: no no, you dont need to look at the path
 MSmits: thats what the possible mine map is for
 Gajowy: what does MSG do?
 MSmits: the path is absolute btw, it's not possible path, absolute path
 Astrobytes: Clever
 MSmits: you split into different states on silence
 Insta-x: Monosodium Glutamate?
 Insta-x: lol
 MSmits: then your path is absolute and so is your possible mine map, only the neighbor is uncertain
 MSmits: why am I telling you how I do this before I have even coded it :P
 Gajowy: but like why whould you use MSG as a submarine
 ZarthaxX: lolo
 Gajowy: enhance the oceans taste?
 Insta-x: maybe
 MSmits: lyrics from your favorite song
 YannT: haaa I get it, you keep a possible mine map per path
 AntiSquid: Gajowy message
 MSmits: YannT yes
 Insta-x: bitboard every possibility?
 MSmits: the only problem is pruning this when you prune chain-silencers. Havent solved that yet
 YannT: MSmits: that's what I wasn't figuring, yes that would work
 MSmits: right now, my first priority is to rewrite my teleporting submarine
 Insta-x: lol
 Insta-x: cool tech
 Insta-x: keep it, you could win easily by teleporting
 Astrobytes: That was truly a superb misunderstanding, I have to say&#160;:)
 YannT: I have a sim that works (only inputs I take from the referee are ennemy orders and current life), but I'm absolutely not using it :p
 MSmits: if it would work, sure :P Instead it just surfaces and thinks it's somewhere else, eventually running into it's own path :P
 Insta-x: sim = simulation?
 Astrobytes: y
 Insta-x: good luck MSmits
 Insta-x: what should we sim?
 MSmits: I imagine the sub captain looking outside the window after surfacing, thinking "I totally just teleported, this water looks completely different".
 Insta-x: lol
 AntiSquid: does it taste differently?
 MSmits: i didn't code that AntiSquid
 Insta-x: its a possibility
 Astrobytes: fix your flavour enhancement Smits
 MSmits: on it
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm off to brave the supermarket, laters
 MSmits: good luck
 ToshiTuringMachine: use mask to go out
 MSmits: kick old people away to protect them
 ToshiTuringMachine: use mask 255.255.255.255 
 MSmits: :P
 Insta-x: lol
 ZarthaxX: yes
 Insta-x: whats with 255.255.255.255? i dont get it, all i know its an ip address
 MSmits: it's not
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: it's a mask that can be used to give you a subnet id if I remember correctly
 Insta-x: dont know anything like that
 Insta-x: lol
 MSmits: i didnt either, but Iam in a internet security course
 Insta-x: have you tried picoCTF?
 MSmits: nope
 emh: it's a mask that protects you from interacting with other IPs I think
 emh: your own 1-IP subnet. right?
 Insta-x: could it protect us from internet virus LOL
 Insta-x: subnet? what is taht?
 Insta-x: *that
 MSmits: a smaller part of the network
 Insta-x: like a wifi?
 MSmits: you use a part of the ip-adress to identify hosts in the network
 MSmits: wifi will do that I think yes
 Insta-x: nope, i dont have wifi in my house
 Insta-x: now im using mobile data from my phone
 MSmits: pretty sure you have it
 MSmits: you just can't use it
 MSmits: because you dont know the wifi password
 AntiSquid: Insta-x www.cybrary.it check it out, goodbye
 MSmits: AntiSquid out? Drop mic?
 emh: hmm.. order more tea or not.. favorited 1 out of 5, now want more of that one. but should finish the 5 also...
 MSmits: are you that bored with ooc
 MSmits: talking about tea now?
 AntiSquid: MSmits if he actually checks it out he might not come back
 MSmits: oh ok
 Insta-x: thx?
 emh: I have open Visual Studio on a template F# project
 Insta-x: im not into cyber security now
 emh: wondering to rewrite my C# in F#
 AntiSquid: ya tea is a far better topic than ooc 
 emh: for lesser cognitive load
 MSmits: which cognitive load you mean your head or the computers?
 emh: my head. hard to come up with new stuff
 emh: besides hit the 100k limit
 MSmits: 100k what?
 emh: code size
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: wow
 AntiSquid: Insta-x it starts with basics, it helps gain a basic general understanding so you don't have to ask what 255... means
 MSmits: it's only been a week
 Insta-x: ok thx, i still have much to learn 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443125546">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443125546</a>this guy doesn't find meand that makes me timeout&#160;:/
 emh: I went out on a tangent. even coding spiral movement using atan2 hehe. but not using it actually
 emh: in production
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl why do you timeout?
 MSmits: you dont prune&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i track my opponent tracking me
 eulerscheZahl: and no
 Insta-x: oo lol
 Insta-x: you also simulate him tracking you?
 MSmits: ahh, I started pruning when blasterpoard showed me a battle vs illedan
 Insta-x: cool
 MSmits: you kinda have to
 eulerscheZahl: yes, trying not to reveal too much about my position
 MSmits: I prune when going over 1000 states
 eulerscheZahl: on my list
 MSmits: I am not even using any abilities besides torpedo yet
 Insta-x: my code cant process more than 200 states
 MSmits: yay for priorities&#160;:)
 Insta-x: but my pruning now can keep all possible states below 100
 Insta-x: even if you chain silence
 MSmits: yea, mine is invulnerable to that as well now
 blasterpoard: the question is, how much information do you lose?
 Insta-x: its all because someone just chain silence lol
 Insta-x: lol, here he is
 blasterpoard: I got pinged
 Insta-x: oo
 AntiSquid: nice Insta-x 
 MSmits: ah yeah blasterpoard, I fixed my pruning
 Insta-x: thx
 MSmits: just resubmitted
 MSmits: will probably not help much in bronze
 blasterpoard: cg... I deleted all of my logic
 MSmits: but maybe you can try a battle vs illedan again, see what happens
 blasterpoard: and started writing an actual bot
 MSmits: what did you have before then?
 Insta-x: an ai?
 blasterpoard: move to minimize avg distance from opponent
 blasterpoard: if expected dmg is &gt;0.7, fire a tornado
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: tornadoes!
 Insta-x: wowo
 blasterpoard: if I can silence, silence 0
 Insta-x: good idea
 Insta-x: lol
 blasterpoard: *torpedo
 blasterpoard: that is my entire bot
 MSmits: good bot
 blasterpoard: #24 right now
 Insta-x: cool
 blasterpoard: for some reason
 AntiSquid: Insta-x why no avatar?
 MSmits: yeah, blasterpoard you say it's so easy to track, but it's actually pretty complicated. It doesn't surprise me that bot is 24
 Insta-x: im kinda lazy i think
 AntiSquid: avatars unlock the hidden +5% win rate feature 
 Insta-x: dont see the point of putting an avatar
 Insta-x: huh?
 MSmits: Insta-x otherwise you look the same as everyone else
 AntiSquid: +5% win rate Insta-x
 MSmits: which is annoying when you're in the top 10
 Insta-x: i dont mind that
 MSmits: you want to be able to distinguish
 Insta-x: why?
 MSmits: it's annoying to others mostly
 blasterpoard: Insta-x if I want to find battles against you in last battles tab, it's annoying if you have no avatar
 Insta-x: oo
 MSmits: otherwise I cant tell from the pics on the recent battles who just beat me
 MSmits: or who I just beat
 blasterpoard: MSmits you failed <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443128704">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443128704</a>
 Insta-x: yeah, i feel that 
 AntiSquid: Insta-x nvm then don't get an avatar then, best to annoy everyone else
 Insta-x: LOL
 AntiSquid: for chat it would be nice to have an avatar though Insta-x
 MSmits: blasterpoard need more pruning apparentkly
 MSmits: I prune after 1k 
 MSmits: this had 660 states
 AntiSquid: otherwise you look like a random person that just made an account and joined chat to type in some random gibberish 
 AntiSquid: Insta-x
 blasterpoard: MSmits I can manage many more states than that
 Insta-x: maybe i'll put something thats still hard to distinguish, so i have an avatar and still annoy everyone :joy:
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: blasterpoard what you consider a state is different from what I consider a state
 MSmits: a
 blasterpoard: but maybe my states are diffferent from yours
 AntiSquid: i like your thinking Insta-x
 Insta-x: how can you have so many states?
 Insta-x: what language?
 MSmits: I have bitboards, 1 bitboard may correspond to a maximum of 225 origins
 Insta-x: for me, i have sets
 emh: hmm.. should I go down or up. C++ or F#
 AntiSquid: F#
 Csipcsirip: do you ust std::bitset&#160;? 
 MSmits: no
 blasterpoard: I use C++, I can handle around 200k states easily, but I'll need some time for other things
 MSmits: yes but how do you define a state blasterpoard?
 Insta-x: i prefer C++ just because i dont know F#
 Insta-x: what is a state for you? blasterpoard
 blasterpoard: and by state I mean all possible opponent move histories from the beginning of the game
 MSmits: does this include the start location?
 blasterpoard: all visited and mined cells
 Insta-x: whats the data structure?
 blasterpoard: and current location
 blasterpoard: and hp
 MSmits: ah ok, because I keep my start location variable in the state
 MSmits: thats why 1 state can be 100+ states \
 Insta-x: data structure for the visited cells
 Csipcsirip: is manual bit toggling much faster MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: in this case I don't care. It just much easier to do 
 Insta-x: how do you guys can have so much states? dont you have to calculate ecery state every turn?
 MSmits: yes, c++ is fast Insta-x
 Csipcsirip: yeah I would use it too if the map would fit in a 64 bit int
 eulerscheZahl: at least we update it, sure
 Insta-x: oo, you use c++
 eulerscheZahl: and filter states
 Insta-x: i use python3
 MSmits: blasterpoard, so you open the game with a  225 - island cells amount of states?
 blasterpoard: MSmits yes
 MSmits: i open the game with 1
 MSmits: thats the difference
 AntiSquid: Insta-x here's a good avatar for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.adinaturals.com/storage/producttypeimages/1551029520.jpg">https://www.adinaturals.com/storage/producttypeimages/1551029520.jpg</a>
 MSmits: so when i have 600 something, that equates to you having 600 times that amount you start with
 AntiSquid: wait i meant this one Insta-x <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Instant_coffee.jpg/1280px-Instant_coffee.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Instant_coffee.jpg/1280px-Instant_coffee.jpg</a>
 MSmits: and if the current silence-turn multiplies that by 10+ you can see my problem&#160;:)
 Insta-x: still easy to distinguish AntiSquid
 MSmits: I should just filter after 500 instead of 1000, see if that fixes it
 blasterpoard: ofc - your way sounds a bit impractical
 Insta-x: lol
 AntiSquid: but it fits your name Insta-x
 Insta-x: hmm?
 MSmits: blasterpoard that's personal I think. I am so used to bitboards from all the board games that this feels very natural
 Insta-x: so you guys have every state from the beginning of the game?
 MSmits: OH!
 MSmits: I had pragmas off
 Insta-x: and prune it every turn?
 MSmits: lol
 blasterpoard: xD
 blasterpoard: Insta-x yes, but we onyl rarely need to prune
 MSmits: Insta-x yes
 Insta-x: c++? very fast i see
 Insta-x: one of the fastest i heard
 AntiSquid: i didn't bother with branching out
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: also not that easy to use
 MSmits: but when you have 30 days it's fine
 Insta-x: yep
 AntiSquid: not gonna bother until friday probably, unless silver overfloods and i get promoted again
 blasterpoard: I don't find C++ that difficult
 Insta-x: gold wil be unlocked next week right?
 MSmits: because you're used to it blasterpoard
 blasterpoard: I like that I can be sure it's actually doing exactly what I write
 Insta-x: I havent learned all the data Structure in c++ so i didnt use it
 MSmits: I like that too, but if I am using a lot of lists and different classes I end up preferring C#
 AntiSquid: no ... just compare C++ to some of the more obscure stuff out there, i mean they are not only obscure languages but the way you have to code some of them is really weird
 Insta-x: all i know is array and queue
 MSmits: blasterpoard can you run another illedan battle, I can't select him&#160;:(
 Insta-x: actually, i also just started using sets, dictionaries and tuples in this contest lol
 Insta-x: MSmits, which league are you in?
 MSmits: bronze still
 blasterpoard: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443133150">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443133150</a>
 MSmits: I have a bad priority queue :P
 Insta-x: ooh ok
 blasterpoard: this one took a bit longer xD
 ToshiTuringMachine: tell that to people who say that 'codingame is not teaching anything'
 MSmits: Boom yeah!
 AntiSquid: Insta-x you're doing well, keep going while you're motivated
 MSmits: I could probably stretch my pruning limit. I am not even timing things
 Insta-x: thx, though im not a motivated as 3 days ago
 Insta-x: im a bit tired, especially programming silence pruning
 AntiSquid: then save current code and try out random fun nonsense 
 Insta-x: it took me 3 full days
 MSmits: my surface is still bugged though, i lost illedan and had an empty position map at the end :P
 MSmits: but he doesnt shoot anyway
 Insta-x: well, i want to try GA
 AntiSquid: JUST DO IT!
 Insta-x: its 10 PM here, so i just want to chat LOL
 AntiSquid: excuses
 blasterpoard: that's the best time to code
 Insta-x: :v you're not wrong actually
 Insta-x: for me, its not, im not used to sleeping late
 AntiSquid: i mean if you're here to chat there's Automaton2000 and he is really cheap, with low hourly rate
 Automaton2000: that is the right approach
 Insta-x: oo, hi? lol
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: long time no see
 Automaton2000: you need to put them in a single line
 icecream17: oh i see you need to type "Automaton2000" for it to work
 Automaton2000: give an example of what you want to know how it works
 Insta-x: what to work?
 AntiSquid: how Automaton2000's body parts work
 icecream17: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: do you think about that?
 MSmits: yeah AntiSquid, do you think about Automaton2000's body parts?
 Automaton2000: so i'm pretty sure they have a nice day
 JBM: i may or may not start streaming again <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/stream-twenty-thousand-loc-under-the-c/168072/7?u=jbm">https://forum.codingame.com/t/stream-twenty-thousand-loc-under-the-c/168072/7?u=jbm</a>
 AntiSquid: may or may not? you become your opponent tracker
 eulerscheZahl: in #de he wrote that he's already streaming again
 MSmits: #de has a better tracker?
 MSmits: they know things we dont
 Insta-x: i dont understand anything there
 wlesavo: here should be some WWjoke
 AntiSquid: jbm knows german?
 eulerscheZahl: a little
 eulerscheZahl: egaetan speaks German too, he even lived there for some years
 AntiSquid: MSmits JBM is ahead of you
 egaetan: only one year eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: Insta-x, not everything we say is a statement of coder genius. Sometimes we talk out of our ass
 eulerscheZahl: my bad
 MSmits: especially AntiSquid :P
 Insta-x: LOL
 Counterbalance: ohh there's a contest
 eulerscheZahl: but i remembered parts of the story
 eulerscheZahl: oh there's a Counterbalance
 wlesavo: fatality addition seems to be working
 Insta-x: java vs python3 performance, which one is better?
 AntiSquid: no, JBM is ahead of you MSmits
 MSmits: you bringing a little mortal kombat into ooc wlesavo?
 blasterpoard: Insta-x almost everything is better than python
 MSmits: ahead of me like what&#160;?
 wlesavo: MSmits sure why not
 emh: when is CG going to support wenyan-lang? I want to code in Chinese
 Insta-x:&#160;:( thats bad, im currently using python
 AntiSquid: on the leaderboard MSmits
 AntiSquid: and he is streaming, so expect more competition / rank drop
 MSmits: bah, everyone and their mom is ahead of me :P
 Insta-x: fatality, you mean pursuing him because you are 100&#160;% will win
 Insta-x:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: my mom isn't, will make her an account MSmits
 MSmits: Insta-x detecting a winning move yeah, I guess so
 wlesavo: it seems that quite a few games can be ended by some finishing move
 MSmits: ignoring other considerations
 Insta-x: well, i like to call that SPARTA actually
 Insta-x: but yeah, good name LOL
 MSmits: ok AntiSquid, just be advised, I will torpedo your mom
 AntiSquid: ehm, ya see? weird MSmits jokes again
 ZarthaxX: ban him
 AntiSquid:  /ban MSmits
 MSmits: I meant, in ooc, sheesh
 AntiSquid:  /kick MSmits
 Insta-x: its not growtopia LOLOL
 AntiSquid: SELECT * AS money FROM MSmits_bank_account
 MSmits: noooo
 blasterpoard: MSmits is so rich that a bank needs a separate db table for him
 Insta-x: its str(" or ""=" ) - injection right?
 Insta-x: *"injection"
 Scarfield: random thing i read the other day: Russians were the first to have torpedos expell gas, to reduce the drag from the water, and making them go much faster
 AntiSquid: it's a 1 row table doh
 MSmits: I'm so rich, I overflow 64 bit and become poor
 Insta-x: i'm so rich i need big Integer
 MSmits: good one, see you're getting the coder jokes now
 AntiSquid: should have said you need a linked list of integers
 Insta-x: if i dont get that joke, than you can say ima very beginner
 Insta-x: *then
 Insta-x: or for c++, im so rich that i need string
 Insta-x: lol
 Insta-x: i never used linked list, but i have used string to store big integer
 emh: yo momma so fat she uses her g-string to store big integer
 Insta-x: LOL
 Scarfield: wow that escalated quickly :D
 AntiSquid: JBM also missing an avatar, maybe should remove mine
 AntiSquid: just for the contest
 JBM: AFAIK you can't
 AntiSquid: you can with CG premium membership, just updated, refresh
 eulerscheZahl: you uploaded the default image
 JBM: re-uploaded default image appears as whatever file format you gave it
 JBM: missing/default avatar is entirely missing, provided as inline html data
 AntiSquid: some people here simply can't afford CG premium i guess
 eulerscheZahl: see it's not real <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/NymtgjV">https://imgur.com/a/NymtgjV</a>
 blasterpoard: tbh I would pay for CG premium if I got extra 5ms per turn
 AntiSquid: do you really need to confront me about a joke? :D
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 ToshiTuringMachine: 5ms lol
 eulerscheZahl: because i can't motivate myself to work on the contest bot
 AntiSquid: will you write a script to filter out and replace my avatar?
 ToshiTuringMachine: it becomes a pay-per-win
 eulerscheZahl: nor the rewording that jbm suggested
 eulerscheZahl: PRs welcome&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: i didn't even read the statement apart from input output section
 AntiSquid: chat discusses the game so much you don't have to read it
 eulerscheZahl: partially the statement is still from the prototype, partially it's what I addedit somehow became a little inconsistent
 eulerscheZahl: he has valid points
 MSmits: I read the statement and I thought I could teleport my sub, chat might've been better :P
 Insta-x: test
 Scarfield: icles
 Azkellas: hon hon hon
 AntiSquid: hey MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: teccles isn't playing the contest yet
 MSmits: hey AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: look up D-star Hexaquark
 MSmits: ok will do in a few. 
 Astrobytes: that's the one you mentioned a few days back Squid?
 AntiSquid: related to the article i was talking about MSmits
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: quarkstars
 AntiSquid: no not stars, dark matter related article
 MSmits: oh, right, interesting
 AntiSquid: 6 quarks fused together somehow .
 MSmits: well normally there's 3
 MSmits: or 2
 MSmits: but mostly 3
 MSmits: protons and neutrons consist of 3
 AntiSquid: yes i am aware
 MSmits: kk
 Astrobytes: It's a Bose-Einstein condensate
 MSmits: brb
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes it is claimed that it's a "dark matter candidate"
 Astrobytes: Yes I know, I'm saying it's formed by Bose-Einstein condensation, fused together at absolute zero
 AntiSquid: ah
 Astrobytes: Pretty fucking cool
 Astrobytes: (pun intended)
 AntiSquid: but space isn't at absolute zero is it?
 eulerscheZahl: get a profile pic AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: No, but during the rapid cooling post-big-bang it may well have been 
 AntiSquid: why eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it's confusing me
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i have a built-in filter to mostly ignore users with no pic
 AntiSquid: lol 
 pb4: didn't you have a profile pic yesterady&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: he had
 eulerscheZahl: the galaxy
 eulerscheZahl: with a red dot where we live
 AntiSquid: no. laniakea with a red dot where the galaxy is
 Illedan: Hi
 Astrobytes: Hello
 dbdr: kovi #1!
 AntiSquid: are you streaming Illedan&#160;?
 AntiSquid: gratz kovi
 dbdr: oh :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: did not expect that
 dbdr: this sub is incredible. might just be luck, it's early
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: overshot by a little
 E_pur_si_muove: @eulerscheZahl: in the gridmaneger when you initailize the grid I think the expression rand.nextInt(26)  is evaluated in every for loop.&#160;???
 aangairbender: is c# compiled by mono? why not .net core?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/GridManager.java#L47">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/GridManager.java#L47</a>yes indeed :D
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even notice yet (not my code, even if i commited)
 eulerscheZahl: now find the bug in this line: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Utils.java#L5">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Utils.java#L5</a>
 eulerscheZahl: because CG struggled to get .net core running on their servers aangairbender
 aangairbender: that is sad
 aangairbender: .net core is very fast
 eulerscheZahl: there might be an update before the may contest
 eulerscheZahl: mono is extremely slow on 2D arrays i noticed
 kovi: back
 kovi: wow
 eulerscheZahl: converting to 1D is much fasternot like that for .net
 kovi: thx dbdr. nice submit btw
 eulerscheZahl: impressive kovi
 Astrobytes: It doesn't flatten 2D arrays under the hood?
 dbdr: well, going up and down a lot. might end up as usual or a bit better
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile: yay, top30!
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know how 2D arrays are implementedbut with mono they are much slower
 eulerscheZahl: for some games i doubled my sim count by converting that
 aangairbender: i am rewriting eveything from c# to rust
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 aangairbender: is rust good for cg? @dbdr
 MSmits: it works, but it runs in the IDE in debug mode afaik
 MSmits: which is annoying because that means you can't test properly with, or against other bots in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: yes, release mode only on submit
 dbdr: aangairbender as a language it's great, I think
 dbdr: the IDE mode is annoying sometimes
 dbdr: currently it's not affecting me in OOC
 MSmits: nah it wouldnt affect me either. It's more for those high performance board games
 wlesavo: mchl12 some crashing in your submit, if you interested <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443170729">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443170729</a>
 dbdr: even for those, performance is great in arena, which is what matters
 aangairbender: btw its easier to express intentions with c#
 aangairbender: imo
 dbdr: you can workaround the IDE thiing
 MSmits: yeah, thats why it is only annoying
 dbdr: do you have an example aangairbender?
 aangairbender: example of what?
 Illedan: AntiSquid, yeah I'll be streaming in 15 min
 MSmits: easier to express intentions aangairbender
 aangairbender: hmm for example c# has linq, easy way to work with collections
 aangairbender: with rust i have to add unwrap() everywhere
 dbdr: that's unrelated
 MSmits: linq has a high risk of you doing things that are extremely costly in terms of performance
 dbdr: unwrap is for unsafe cases
 dbdr: you can work with collections like filter map etc without unwrap
 kovi: hmm, im not loosing vs pb4
 dbdr: and get the same performance as hand-written loops
 MSmits: I've never understood why foreach would sometimes be slower than for or reverse in C#
 MSmits: the compiler should be able to look at the code and just compile it in the fastest way
 aangairbender: with .net core its fast
 pb4: damn kovi
 MSmits: I'm talking about marginal differences, like 10%
 aangairbender: I've read an article about for vs foreach, but I don tremember details(
 kovi: france and hungary both has 3 players in top10
 dbdr: nice!
 dbdr: room for one more country
 MSmits: I'm trying!
 wlesavo: kovi now im the one loosing to pb4
 dbdr: 10 - 1, ouch
 aangairbender: i loved how I only needed working simulation+1tick minimax to be in legend in PokerChipRace
 aangairbender: but for this one i hope there is not any simulation based strategies
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong with simulations?
 wlesavo: i probably need to wait till pb4 will stop resubmiting :slight_smile:
 aangairbender: nothing wrong
 aangairbender: btw are they applicable here?
 MSmits: you do some kind of simulation yes
 MSmits: you simulate where the opponent sub can be
 Ille-Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/codingame">https://www.twitch.tv/codingame</a>
 kovi: nice submit pb4
 aangairbender: dbdr do you gave script for merging code into single file?
 dbdr: yes, but it's not in a releasable state I think, with some custom stuff in it
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 dbdr: there was one mentioned on the forum though
 aangairbender: ok, thanks
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/rust-crate-source-bundler/2877">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/rust-crate-source-bundler/2877</a>
 emh: what's everyone's favourite C++ single-header coroutine / generator library?
 aangairbender: bits/stdc++.h
 aangairbender: if i understood question correctly xD
 aangairbender: oh
 aangairbender: seems not
 emh: I just want my "yield return"&#160;:)
 ToshiTuringMachine: ... you are so clever you need a shortint to store your IQ
 aangairbender:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Toshi coming with the jokes from 3 hours ago :D
 aangairbender: for school times
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah my brain is degrading back to school
 ToshiTuringMachine: i can't get that silver... i was 3th nownow
 eulerscheZahl: how many points below the boss?
 ZarthaxX: ToshiTuringMachine same, i got retarded
 ToshiTuringMachine: i didn't check
 Astrobytes: "got" ZarthaxX? :P
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah ZarthaxX &gt;) drunks on coding
 MSmits: I've always wondered when that happened ZarthaxX, tell us more :p
 Astrobytes: TardaxX
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes good poinrt
 Astrobytes: Tardobytes
 ZarthaxX: MSmits is that a joke?
 MSmits: of course&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: savage
 MSmits: you can take it
 ToshiTuringMachine: tardTuringMachine
 Astrobytes: ToshiTardingMachine
 ToshiTuringMachine: how comes I have same results ignoring enemy silence... lol
 ToshiTuringMachine: bronze
 ZarthaxX: f
 MSmits: sorry I cant finish that, my students could be watching
 Astrobytes: Did you convince any to take part?
 AntiSquid: gonna ban the bear for calling ZarthaxX retarded
 MSmits: nah, i was planning on sending them a message, but this contest is too hard I think. Something like code a la mode would be better
 AntiSquid: for relaxing yes ^
 Astrobytes: They wouldn't like the challenge?
 AntiSquid: this isn't a relaxing game for lockdown :D
 AntiSquid: it's like perfect torture
 MSmits: I think they wouldn't get anywhere
 MSmits: or do you think there's an easy way to make a bot 
 MSmits: that doesnt require tracking and such?
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: there was no way out of wood2 without tracking
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid right LOL 
 MSmits: yeah thats what I mean
 MSmits: I dont think they can do the tracking
 ZarthaxX: you will ban myself nice move AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: remember kutulu contest when wood boss was overpowered?
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: this contest felt even harder in wood :D
 ZarthaxX: MSmits maybe random moving and shootigng work
 ZarthaxX: works
 ZarthaxX: but idk
 ZarthaxX: but it was a rough start
 MSmits: btw, i dont think this games wood boss  is overpowered. The game is just hard to begin with
 ZarthaxX: right
 MSmits: any boss that "works" is gonna be hard to beat.
 ZarthaxX: maybe making enemy visible for wood 2 would have been better
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: MSmits wood 2 boss is same as wood 1 and default AI, it tracks you down and fucks you up
 MSmits: i didnt have problems with it at all. I skipped wood 1
 MSmits: before it was nerfed
 ZarthaxX: the devs of the game were really inspired for those wood bosses :P
 MSmits: you just need a tracker is all
 AntiSquid: ya but, you shouldn't need that for wood
 MSmits: I agree, but then the game would be fundamentally different
 AntiSquid: normally you just need to not ram your head full speed into a wall and just throw in some skils and promoted
 MSmits: also, the boss shoots himself
 MSmits: a lot
 ZarthaxX: im with squido on this one
 AntiSquid: no MSmits, same game, just weaker wood bosses
 ZarthaxX: make a bot that uses the actual actions and pass
 MSmits: but how would you know where to fire?
 MSmits: how to even damage the boss?
 AntiSquid: it has to move lol
 Astrobytes: BRute-force and ignorance ofc
 ZarthaxX: maybe making nemey visible
 MSmits: random shooting is kinda hard with a 3x3 blast in  a 15x15 map
 ZarthaxX: and torpedo be replaced by a move 
 AntiSquid: the problem is tracks you very well MSmits
 ZarthaxX: that has a pathfdinger
 ZarthaxX: finder
 MSmits: so it comes to me, that is convenient :P
 Astrobytes: Paaaathfinger
 AntiSquid: imagine xmas rush, but wood bosses go straight to item, which isn't the case
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes youuuuuuuuuuu shut up
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: MSmits you took a while to promote out of wood and so did many others, so that's proof enough the bosses were too strong
 MSmits: still a lot of people out of wood though
 AntiSquid: either way i find it annoying when they nerf them retroactively after you commited to improve your bot and pass them -.-
 MSmits: me too
 MSmits: also, I found it extremely annoying my bot skipped wood 1
 dbdr: that work is not lost
 AntiSquid: MSmits out of wood after probably nerfing them again or resubmitting boss
 AntiSquid: just add silence then maybe you promote to silver MSmits
 MSmits: i like the abilities coming in slowly
 MSmits: haha yeah, i should stop torpedo-ing every 3rd turn
 MSmits: i'm 50th in bronze with that now
 MSmits: I want to fix a bug or two first
 AntiSquid: well maybe wood should be manual promote
 AntiSquid: because otherwise you need to setup locally and manually change to wood2
 Csipcsirip: what I dont like is that you have to wait like 300 rounds for something to happen
 MSmits: i dont mind either way, they should ask the players that have a lower skill level. It doesnt matter if it takes a long time to get out of wood, if you eventually do
 AntiSquid: when you bored of wood: type promote or something
 MSmits: if you never get out of wood thats a different story
 MSmits: br2k bosses for example
 MSmits: I never got out of wood 2
 MSmits: ofc that is more like gold but still
 AntiSquid: never tried that game seriously
 AntiSquid: just submitted random
 MSmits: its fun, but i didnt know how to eval 
 Numby: Anyone knows if Java inheritance incurs additional overhead (or no due to type erasure)? I'm considering creating &amp; extending an abstract class to share a helper method vs creating the same method static
 pb4: Was it bad that bosses were strong in BR2K&#160;?
 MSmits: no, it was a different kind of contest
 MSmits: can't really compare
 MSmits: I was just saying it kinda gave me a feeling for how it would be for people who cant get out of wood in a regular contest
 Astrobytes: I think stronger bosses work well in long contests
 Astrobytes: You get more out of it
 Astrobytes: imo
 Astrobytes: The BR2K format was nice
 MSmits: I like how reCurse won it with a NN. That's something you can't do in a regular contest
 MSmits: which is a good thing imho. But no reason it shouldnt be allowed in an unofficial contest
 Astrobytes: Who said it shouldn't?
 MSmits: noone said
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, thought someone had 
 MSmits: don't think so. I think most people liked the fact that he pulled it off in that timeframe
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was impressive
 icecream17: what happened?
 MSmits: reCurse won br2k unofficial contest with a neural network in I think 14 days? Probably a lot less
 ZarthaxX: besat.
 ZarthaxX: beast.
 Astrobytes: Wasn't br2k a 4 week-er?
 MSmits: hmm could be yeah
 MSmits: anyways, his bot was unbeatable much sooner
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it was
 eulerscheZahl: 3 weeks i think
 eulerscheZahl: not a real contest anyways
 Astrobytes: It's a shame it wasn't. But I liked the unofficial contest idea
 Csipcsirip: can you link that contest pls&#160;?
 MSmits: it's just an arena
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/bit-runner-2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/bit-runner-2048</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i never tried, not looks like csb2 to me
 MSmits: it's mostly the engine
 Astrobytes: Yeah, bit more to it than just racing&#160;:)
 pb4: CSB on steroids(TM)
 eulerscheZahl: still i think it was a good decision not to turn it into a contest on a first look
 MSmits: but eulerscheZahl is right, it's not an official contest. It's more like what happens occasionally in a new community multi when a lot of good players start it at the same time. We had this with yavalath for a while as well
 MSmits: br2k just had better PR
 eulerscheZahl: pull request?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: you know what I mean :P
 eulerscheZahl: seriously i don't get it
 MSmits: public relations
 Astrobytes: public relations
 MSmits: advertising
 eulerscheZahl: oh, aaaah
 wlesavo: lol resubing pb4 somehow got me to #4
 Tunga: in 5 minute contest, pythoners are advantaged as hell&#160;??
 MSmits: why would there be a 5 min contest
 wlesavo: CoCtest
 Astrobytes: think he meant CoC
 MSmits: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: try codeforces if you like short contests
 Tunga: There is a contest where I just typed the library name and 5-10 more characters and won (in python ofc)
 Tunga: Yes CoC
 MSmits: call it a clash
 MSmits: contest has a completely different meaning to us&#160;:)
 MSmits: but yeah, python has a major advantage in short contests, just like c++ does in moderate to long ones if they require performance
 Uljahn: ye, rigth tool for the job
 AntiSquid: clash of code isn't contest D:
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeahhh silver
 ZarthaxX: gz!
 ToshiTuringMachine: ty ZarthaxX
 ToshiTuringMachine: time to rewrite
 dkov: has someone win rates for utlimate tic tac to for x, o and draws?
 eulerscheZahl: ask MSmits about that
 MSmits: dkov, around 67% for p1 and 33% for p2 is normal
 jacek: an draws
 MSmits: I count a draw as 50% win
 MSmits: if you do that, you get the 67/33 
 MSmits: however, I do believe it would be solved to a win for p1
 MSmits: if you could
 MSmits: running a meta mcts approaching the best play, usually increases p1 winrate I've found (lately that is, I've thought differently before)
 dkov: oh! I did not ask my question right!
 dkov: for a random mc simulation, what are the win percentages?
 MSmits: oh, no idea
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think anyone thought that would be interesting to test
 MSmits: for example, it would strongly depend on the first move 
 dkov: cause my old simulater gives 49/43/8my new one: 41/39/20random first move
 jacek: and how are they different
 jacek: do you use 1-ply win check
 dkov: different implementation but they should yield the same result. i suspect there might be a bug in one of them or biased random numbers.i don't know, what you mean by 1-ply win check
 jacek: if there is a move that would win the game, make it. otherwise make random move
 dkov: no 1-ply win check in both
 eulerscheZahl: these numbers are close together, can just be randomness
 eulerscheZahl: you need more runs for a reliable result
 eulerscheZahl: but p1 should have an advantage over p2 for random rollouts as well
 dkov: they are consistent with millions of runs
 dkov: these are percentages, sorry
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i thought you just ran 100 games
 eulerscheZahl: then the 49/43/8 sounds more reasonable to me
 MrTimber: Hi PHP devs, if you are interested, I made a project that allows you to code using different source files, with a small tool that combines everything into a single file for synchronization with Coding Game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MrTimber/OceanOfCodePHP">https://github.com/MrTimber/OceanOfCodePHP</a>
 Astrobytes: MrTimber post that in the forum and/or discord so people can find it&#160;:)
 dkov: i messed up the victory condition in the new simulator. now I get similar results. thanks for the help
 jacek: good for you
 Astrobytes: you gonna join the contest jacek?
 jacek: unlikely
 jacek: i havent done anything game/ai for past few months
 jacek: im getting old
 Ille-Stream: Top 150 on stream :tada:
 Astrobytes: getting old! 
 Astrobytes: gratz Illedan
 Astrobytes: Stream
 Astrobytes: Ille-Stream
 Ille-Stream: I'll swap :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: hm?
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: oh i see you slightly overshot your main eh?
 Illedan: My main is still broken :P
 Illedan: It's 25th or something
 AntiSquid: ah right
 AntiSquid: why did you break it if you can reach top 50&#160;?
 Illedan: I'm working on my new tracking system
 Illedan: Need a test bot with silence only
 Illedan: Fix 1 thing at a time&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Test against mine, it only silences
 Illedan: I like to know what I'm testing against :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 JFB: Illedan - so you can test agains me too - is deterministic, only torpedo + silence (1 step)
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I'm also deterministic fwiw :P
 AntiSquid: fwiw&#160;?
 Counterbalance: for what it's worth, iirc
 Astrobytes: yrc
 AntiSquid: faa
 icecream17: it's worth it - easier to debug. unfortunately I silence and mine randomly.
 eulerscheZahl: sttla
 Astrobytes: ok you got me there squiddy
 Astrobytes: and you too euler
 AntiSquid: last a stands for acronym
 AntiSquid: s
 Counterbalance: still no bot functions like !urbandict here?
 AntiSquid: "still no"
 Astrobytes: say no more AntiSquid lol
 Astrobytes: nope
 Counterbalance: we had that stuff 24 years ago on IRC
 Astrobytes: Tell CG :D
 AntiSquid: you can add your own bot
 Astrobytes: True
 AntiSquid: flood chat with Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: yes i do
 Automaton2000: as long as it is
 AntiSquid: see? they are ready to flood the chat any time
 Counterbalance: !rank
 Astrobytes: yeah but AutomatonXXXX help/faq/translate/die/troll etc would be more useful
 Counterbalance: !slap AutomatonNN
 AntiSquid: unlike other chats: discord for examplehere you can add your own bot and nobody will stop you?!
 AutomatonNN: maybe it's a good idea
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Counterbalance: lol
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 !die
 Automaton2000: if you want to keep it simple
 AntiSquid: it's never simple Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this got me to gold
 Astrobytes: both bots on form this evening
 Counterbalance: move is executed before torpedo? (got a fired out of range) Or does it depend on the order of the commands given?
 Astrobytes: Depends on order yeah
 ZarthaxX: the things are executed sequentially
 Counterbalance: thanks
 AntiSquid: it depends on your output Counterbalance
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance read the rules sheez
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you can do MOVE N|TORPEDO 0 3 or the other way around
 eulerscheZahl: not recommended Counterbalance
 AntiSquid: you could just read chat more often, like i did, i didn't read the rules
 Astrobytes: is the referee that bad? Not looked at it yet
 Counterbalance: I only found out today - too busy with extra work due to the crapshoot going on
 eulerscheZahl: reading the chat also helps to find out about a contest
 eulerscheZahl: the referee has UI and game logic merged
 Astrobytes: How 'merged' is merged
 eulerscheZahl: illedan decoupled it but doesn't seem in a mood to push it to the public repo
 eulerscheZahl: so merged that he broke the game logic when he tried to add extra animation frames
 Astrobytes: oh ffs :D
 eulerscheZahl: old prototype from CG that we inherited
 eulerscheZahl: existed before the kutulu contest
 Astrobytes: yeah, I know it wasn't you guys
 Astrobytes: Still, Illedan, push the decoupled version will ya
 eulerscheZahl: spot the bug that will cause problems for other constraints <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Utils.java#L5">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Utils.java#L5</a>
 Counterbalance: like non square grids
 eulerscheZahl: and we have a winner
 icecream17: how does the seed work
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, ffs. Is that used in any non-square grid context in the ref though? 
 AntiSquid: this sub game was linked on slack back when BotG was in development
 AntiSquid: and was still titled captain sonar
 eulerscheZahl: and i scrolled all the way up in the history and found it there
 eulerscheZahl: then it stopped working with the pixi.js update
 Astrobytes: They should bring the PacMan one too
 Astrobytes: It looked pretty nice
 AntiSquid: maybe we could ask the admins if we can just host it as a regular multi&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Or unofficial contest. Mind you, probably wouldn't be best as a contest since the format has been done to death elsewhere
 AntiSquid: "i sniped this game, can i host it?"
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: *idea not format
 eulerscheZahl: say it's your own game and hope they don't remember
 Astrobytes: Change the graphics a bit
 Zenoscave: Illedan
 Zenoscave: are you streaming?
 Astrobytes: Get eulerscheZahl to do them in fact
 Astrobytes: He already did Zeno
 Zenoscave: cool maybe i'll find some useful stuff
 Zenoscave: My code needs some cleanup
 eulerscheZahl: my bot just gets worse, even if i improve in self-play&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: Yeah, this silver is getting rough
 struct: This is why I havent started
 struct: I cant get worse than default code
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't remember which was my best submit
 Astrobytes: No versioning, tsk tsk euler
 Zenoscave: I have versioning but the scoring for same code is too erratic
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'm just trolling 
 Zenoscave: :P
 blasterpoard: imagine trying to find out where did your bot make a mistake in legend
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - for example in match with my bot - your bot crashed. Probably my bot done too many silence
 Zenoscave: Yeah silence timeouts are crazy
 Zenoscave: still can't fully do all the paths
 AntiSquid: i am sure at some point i fixed a bug dropped 50 ranks, improved tracking a bit and jumped 50 ranks back up, maybe i should have kept the bug and just improve? :thinking: -regarding versioning
 Zenoscave: I can handle about 1.5k paths total between two players
 Zenoscave: Who knows AntiSquid, this is getting tough to predict
 eulerscheZahl: do you happen to have a replay JFB?
 AntiSquid: e
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's not your silence
 Illedan: Zenoscave, I'm done streaming
 Zenoscave: thanks Illedan&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: eulerscheZahl www.codingame.com/replay/443250074 just play vs illedan if you want to check
 Illedan: I added the link to discord and the forum
 blasterpoard: and yes, you crash vs silence cpam
 Zenoscave: cpam?
 blasterpoard: spam
 Zenoscave: ah
 eulerscheZahl: hm, didn't expect that but it's indeed the silence here
 eulerscheZahl: but most of my timeouts should result from me trying to rebuild the opponent tracking me
 Astrobytes: CPAM - Comprehensive Perl Archive Memories
 eulerscheZahl: and if the opponent has poor tracking, i find too many options for myself and timeout
 JFB: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443207245">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443207245</a>
 Zenoscave: oh god at least it isn't CPAN
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: c like in mice @Astrobytes :p
 eulerscheZahl: ok, JFB playing the hiding game with me as well
 Astrobytes: yeah I know squid
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pics.astrologymemes.com/sack-of-eyes-if-the-gh-sound-in-enough-is-19575378.png">https://pics.astrologymemes.com/sack-of-eyes-if-the-gh-sound-in-enough-is-19575378.png</a>
 Zenoscave: I love and hate that I new exactly where that was going
 Astrobytes: lol that's exactly what I thought of
 AntiSquid: i disagree with the bottom statement though
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - I do not understun why you have problem with tracking yourself. As you see - in tris replay, just before your bot stopped, both bots (your and my) knows exactly where you are
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid which is your nomination
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: in this replay it's tracking you which causes the timeout
 AntiSquid: don't think anything is more ridiculous than a giant "alphabet" that people in their 40s who learnt it their entire life didn't master it
 eulerscheZahl: but i also had caes where tracking myself was the problem
 eulerscheZahl: well, good night
 JFB: good night&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 Zenoscave: gn&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Which alphabet AntiSquid? 
 AntiSquid: you can pick between mandarin and cantonese
 Astrobytes: Couldn't possibly comment tbh, not enough experience
 AntiSquid:     Electric + Vision = TV 电视 （diànshì）
 aangairbender: ok I made a script for merging c# code into a single file
 aangairbender: going to split my code into some files/folder
 Astrobytes: Intonation means a lot huh Antisquid
 MSmits: yay silver
 MSmits: so this is interesting. I was fixing a nasty bug. When I fixed it, my submit was way worse
 MSmits: then i resubmitted my bugged version and I am in silver
 Astrobytes: Standard contest bot behaviour :D
 MSmits: yeah...
 MSmits: also it is still just shooting torpedoes every 3 turns :P
 Astrobytes: gz btw
 MSmits: thanks
 MiniWolskys: Am I the only one feeling like there is a bug with the input for the map in Ocean of Code in C&#160;? Just added a print to the standard code and only half the map is present
 MSmits: I'm guessing you added the print wrong
 ZarthaxX: you are the bug MiniWolskys
 MSmits: but i wouldnt know how to check, i dont know C
 aangairbender: input is given to all languages in the same way
 Uljahn: there is a limit for debug output length
 nnminh171298: i print the whole map ok
 Counterbalance: you can print at least 2 maps and some more lines 
 MSmits: you should be able to at least print a map
 MSmits: yeah
 MiniWolskys: I print everything with no problem with my own input code but not with the default one
 nnminh171298: aaaaa how come I beat you every game and you up rank, MSmits
 MSmits: it's not about beating a specific person
 Uljahn: ah, the stub could be far from perfect
 MSmits: it's about being strong against most important
 MSmits: most people sorry
 MSmits: also, if you get near the boss on a submit, try to make your bot strong against it
 MiniWolskys: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/D2xNTWr">https://imgur.com/a/D2xNTWr</a>
 accorp: MSmits, how old are you, btw?
 MiniWolskys: All I added is the fprintf line and I don't think I have done it wrong, but only 8 lines are printed of the 15
 MSmits: I'm 39 
 Astrobytes: What about you accorp? 
 aangairbender: MiniWolskys try adding if (i &gt; height/2) before pprintf
 aangairbender: to check whether its a debug size limit
 Counterbalance: MAP: 0 ........xx.....MAP: 1 MAP: 2 ........xx.....MAP: 3 MAP: 4 ...............MAP: 5 
 Counterbalance: it's fubar
 Zenoscave: the engine is fubar Counterbalance?
 Counterbalance: no, the stub I think
 MiniWolskys: Yeah that's the format I got when I added the line to my print, but why is it not picking every other line then&#160;?
 Counterbalance: ok, make it so:
 MiniWolskys: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/m1Nyity">https://imgur.com/a/m1Nyity</a>
 Zenoscave: also fprintf(strderr, "%s\n", line);
 Zenoscave: fprintf doesn't add newlines
 Counterbalance: fgets reads at most 1less than the given size, so, width bytes. The newline is not read.
 Counterbalance: alternatively, add  fgetc(stdin) after the fgets()
 MiniWolskys: On my own code I fixed it with a fgetc() at the end, but I feel like this is a complicated start if you don't pay attention
 Counterbalance: yes indeed
 MiniWolskys: if I add the \n it print 3 empty line instead xD
 Zenoscave: perhaps we could reach out to the team
 accorp: it's completely eef'd
 MiniWolskys: I'll post a message on the forum on the OoC bug thread
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 accorp: is it because the new line is "\n\r"?
 MiniWolskys: Good to know it's not just in my head
 Zenoscave: I doubt it
 Counterbalance: no, because the line size is width + 1, and fgets reads width + 1 - 1 bytes
 Zenoscave: Counterbalance is right
 Counterbalance: the same kind of bug could occur when reading the opponent orders, but they use a buffer of 201 bytes so it's less likely
 Zenoscave: Wait they use a static sized buffer????
 Zenoscave: Oh many ideas are flowing
 accorp: this can't be right, C does what its told to...

 ZarthaxX: smito when is that 40yo birthday
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/fgets">https://linux.die.net/man/3/fgets</a>
 MSmits: not for a while ZarthaxX, it's in 2021
 ZarthaxX: ah we wont be alive by then
 Counterbalance: so your birthday was before 21 jan?
 ZarthaxX: asteroid hitting on april
 Zenoscave: Since when is there an asteroid
 MSmits: eh no, it wasn't. Are we using ooc tracking methods on my birthday?
 ZarthaxX: sinece 2020 sucks
 ZarthaxX: you will pewpew the asteroid right zeno?
 Zenoscave: PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW
 ZarthaxX: and save the contest
 Counterbalance: hehje yeah, my tracking is too restrictive in my bot too
 Zenoscave: maybe top 20 again!
 ZarthaxX: pog
 Zenoscave: 18 heyo!!!!
 ZarthaxX: gz!
 Zenoscave: and back down to 20 I need to quit estimating
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: ohh, I just had a great idea
 MSmits: to check your tracking
 MSmits: when the opponent possible locations map empties, break your game update loop
 MSmits: then check a submit for timeouts
 ZarthaxX: put an assert
 Counterbalance: TRACKING BUG: no opp cells!
 accorp: Counterbalance, this means the last char is forced to be \0, in this case the carry is not returned
 Zenoscave: It works decent
 Counterbalance: accorp yes indeed
 MSmits: does anyone else have problems with repeated code in recursive functions and such? I always found it hard to extract repeated stuff out of a recursive function like that
 MSmits: it messes with references and such when i pull it out and separate it into a different function
 MSmits: for example, my silence function. I have 4 loops with small differences for the 4 directions. But there is a recursive element due to the silence happening in 4 steps
 MSmits: so i end up with this bloated code
 ZarthaxX: u mean like repeated processing of diff actions?
 MSmits: yeah my processing of actions is also recursive
 ZarthaxX: same but i meant that repeats in manyplaces
 MSmits: but a single silence action is recursive in and of itself
 ZarthaxX: it gets way too repetitive
 MSmits: yeah
 Counterbalance: you should be able to factor out functions without a problem..
 MSmits: a more experienced c++ coder might
 Uljahn: why recursive? can't you iterate and break when needed?
 MSmits: hard to explain, has to do with damage map being carried down the action list
 MSmits: having it recursive means it is easier to pass it on changed or unchanged depending on the actions
 MSmits: on a silence, you split into several branches also
 MSmits: it's kind of a tree structure
 ZarthaxX: should stop giving out your ideas in a contest:P
 MSmits: yeah, I'll stop now
 Counterbalance: so you have something like if (left) { left-specific-code; copy-past-code}else if (right) { right-specific-code; copy-paste-code} ...?
 MSmits: hmm not exactly no
 MSmits: I go down all possible directions for silence
 MSmits: and iterate 4 steps
 MSmits: but each silence step is a possible silence end result so the processing of actions should continue
 MSmits: pretty sure everyone does this btw, i am not giving anything away here
 MSmits: but anyway, all 4 directions have the same code
 MSmits: instead dy = -1 or +1 or 0 etc.
 Counterbalance: and you can't do   foreach (direction) { explore(dir) }
 ZarthaxX: yeah not a spoiler
 MSmits: hmm how would you define a direction?
 MSmits: like a list of dx,dy structs?
 Counterbalance: something simple like  for (int dir = 0; dir &lt; 4; dir++)  {  Pos next{cur + dir};  blah; }
 Counterbalance: ehh Pos next{ cur + directions[dir] }
 MSmits: yeah I think that might work, I dont work in directions, but in dx, dy, but that could be a constant array of 4 structs {dx, dy}
 accorp: first 4s being general directions and the seconds are diagonals
 MSmits: dont need diagonals for silence
 accorp: same for cross, first 4s are west, second are E and so on
 aangairbender: for silence i have two nested loops, first loops on directions, seconds loops on distance
 MSmits: yeah, that's what i am changing to  now, as advised by Counterbalance. Thanks by the way
 MSmits: oh I had a very general coding question btw, that has been bugging me for a while.
 Counterbalance: np. If you use constexpr arrays and unroll-loops you'll hardly notice the difference. BUt it should be possible to factor out the identical code to a function so you kan keep the 4 optimisations
 MSmits: whats a constexpr array?
 Counterbalance: you could even use a template&lt;&gt; inline function() 
 MSmits: just a const?
 Counterbalance: better
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: so, for my next question
 Counterbalance: constexpr's are really compile-time constant, const kind of
 MSmits: what if I have boolean that is changed only once in the entire run of the program, but is not constant. Yet I have a lot of if statements that refer to this boolean. Will this slow me down at all?
 Counterbalance: (const int foo = 0; will still create a variable on the stack; constexpr int foo = 0 doesn't)
 MSmits: kk, will try that, thanks
 Counterbalance: It'll slow you down a little, I suppose, but probably not enough to change the approach. If the variable is referenced a lot it's likely cached. But every memory compare + jump does take a little time. If it's not changed in a function you could create a const copy of it (on the stack), that might speed it up a little.
 Counterbalance: Is it a win-condition check or something?
 MSmits: well say I expand 100k times during a uttt turn and in each expansion I do if(playerId == 0)
 MSmits: the playerId is set at the start
 MSmits: this is just the first thing that comes to mind, i ran into this many times
 Counterbalance: aha, and you have an else // playerId == 1 aswell?
 MSmits: well there is automatically an else if it affects what comes after. For the compiler it doesn't matter if there is an else or not
 MSmits: it's branching either way
 Counterbalance: you _could_ define the function as a template and pass the playerid as a template param, that way the compiler optimizes the ifs out
 MSmits: you mean they become two different functions?
 Counterbalance: template&lt;int playerId&gt; calculate(...) {}
 MSmits: one for p1 and one for p2?
 Counterbalance: yes
 MSmits: interesting
 MSmits: I never used a template before tbh
 Counterbalance: the caller would do if (playerId == 0) calculate&lt;0&gt;(..) else calculate&lt;1&gt;(..)
 Counterbalance: (the template param has to be a compile-time constant so you can't do  calculate&lt;playerId&gt;(..), I think)
 accorp: trade off - memory
 Skril: if the condition doesn't change during the game, branch prediction should kick in and reduce the cost of the test
 MSmits: memory to store functions in you mean accorp?
 ZarthaxX: i guess he did
 MSmits: Skril that is what i was wondering about, does branch prediction work that well in this situation
 ZarthaxX: why woudlnt
 MSmits: i have no idea, i know what branch prediction is sort of, but no idea how it works in detail
 MSmits: where does it even keep the stats
 ZarthaxX: i saw that last year
 ZarthaxX: a hardware table
 ZarthaxX: it's quite amazing
 Skril: it's done at cpu level
 MSmits: seems magic to me
 dbdr: it's part of the CPU
 ZarthaxX: has like a fsm
 ZarthaxX: made in hardware
 MSmits: fsm?
 Skril: it recognises patterns
 ZarthaxX: finite state machine
 MSmits: ah
 ZarthaxX: just 4 cases
 Skril: it starts execution code for the prediction it does for the test
 dbdr: also branch locations are hashes
 ZarthaxX: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Branch_prediction_2bit_saturating_counter-dia.svg/600px-Branch_prediction_2bit_saturating_counter-dia.svg.png">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Branch_prediction_2bit_saturating_counter-dia.svg/600px-Branch_prediction_2bit_saturating_counter-dia.svg.png</a>
 ZarthaxX: that's the states
 dbdr: with a small width like say 8 bits, so you definitely get collisions
 ZarthaxX: it's from wikipedia anyway
 MSmits: mmh ok
 dbdr: so depending on one byte shift in your code, you will get collisions or not
 dbdr: and very diffrerent perf
 dbdr: fun
 MSmits: I see
 Uljahn: isn't it NN based in recent CPU architectures?
 MSmits: well, I am now ranked 179 in silver with a bot that only shoots torpedos all the time and never uses any other action. Also ignores all mines
 ZarthaxX: i think
 ZarthaxX: good
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 dbdr: MSmits but it tracks the opponent perfectly, I'm sure
 MSmits: It probably does, I changed it to break from the update loop as soon as it loses all positions
 MSmits: which crashes the bot
 dbdr: yeah, that's a great debugging opportunity
 MSmits: all my losses seem to be death from torpedo and mines
 MSmits: do people use sonar?
 dbdr: what else, surface?&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: he meant his crash 
 MSmits: surface maybe... but dont see it that often
 dbdr: I do. but I did not tune my actions much
 accorp: Counterbalance, you didn't finish your take on templates...
 MSmits: just wondering if sonar is a common top bot-action
 MSmits: or if it is like archers in code royale&#160;:)
 dbdr: not really I think
 MSmits: do you think it might help when you detect an opponent that doesn't care about killing you, just tries to out-silence you?
 MSmits: then your own silence is useless
 dbdr: I might be wrong pb uses sonar too
 Counterbalance: oh well, your point about double the code size is very valid; it depends on the compiler and cpu whether one is faster than the other
 MSmits: and you may be better off sonaring
 dbdr: it would be if it's a top strategy
 Counterbalance: but, premature optimisation is the source of all evil, so get it right first and then see if you need to resort to compiler tricks&#160;;)
 MSmits: true Counterbalance. I just do all these simple board games so often that I quickly run into questions like this
 dbdr: are you saying that to MSmitsboard?  :upside_down:
 Counterbalance: you guys say BUG a lot - makes it hard to search the console output for bugreports 
 accorp: this is just academic&#160;:) is it just perfect for the template to boolean?
 Counterbalance: They're fun though, right MSmits?
 MSmits: very
 MSmits: this is sort of like a boardgame. It's quite simple compared to most contests. I dont mean simple to play, but very few rules. I like it
 Counterbalance: I detest copy-paste code, because I spend a lot of time cleaning up other people's mess at work. Fix a bug, then it turns out the code is copy-pasted 5 more places so I have to do the same thing 5 times, and that's 4 times too many
 MSmits: I detest it too, I am just not that experienced in preventing it
 MostComplicatedUsername: Hm
 MostComplicatedUsername: Function
 Counterbalance: if you want really fast code then it's very hard to avoid.. I changed my  pos = cur + direction[dir] approach to 4 blocks in another multi and got 20% speed increase, so there's definitely something to say for it under certain circumstances
 MSmits: yeah! Thats exactly why it bothers me
 accorp: isn't the ugliest of things? :D
 MostComplicatedUsername: AHA
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im dum
 MSmits: but smart enough to realize it
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;;/
 MSmits: it's a sad state to be in
 MostComplicatedUsername: YEah
 MSmits: better be even dumber and not know it
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ignorance is bliss
 MostComplicatedUsername: I was surfacing constantly 
 MSmits: being dumb is like being dead. It's only painful for others - Ricky Gervais
 Counterbalance: lol
 MostComplicatedUsername: And I realized that I wasn't resetting the trail once I surfaced
 accorp: best to know where you stand at
 MSmits: MostComplicatedUsername then I was much dumber
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;?
 MSmits: I read the statement carefully and concluded that you can teleport anywhere you have visited when you surface
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol
 ZarthaxX: Counterbalance how is those 4 blocks
 ZarthaxX: idea
 MSmits: By using surface you will reset your path of visited cells so that you can freely move to a cell that you have previously visited. 
 MostComplicatedUsername: yeah
 MSmits: freely move to a cell -&gt; teleport!!!
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: makes sense
 Counterbalance: { pos.y --; foo(); } // up{ pos.y+=2; foo(); } // down ..  ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: but you need ifs?
 ZarthaxX: or what
 MSmits: it's basically like manually unrolling a loop
 Counterbalance: yeah you do, for bounds checks...
 accorp: +2?
 ZarthaxX: wait
 Counterbalance: yes because you did y-- before.. 
 ZarthaxX: u apply one, call, apply other, call
 ZarthaxX: that way?
 Counterbalance: the foo() is just a placeholder for basically the same code again and again
 ZarthaxX: oh god ugly
 Counterbalance: normally you'd do  foreach (dir) { next = cur + directions[dir]; if (next.inBounds()) foo(); }  but that is slower
 accorp: MISRA is coming for you...
 MostComplicatedUsername: Something odd is happening...
 MSmits: a game with a lot of BFS for example right Counterbalance
 MSmits: like Xmas rush
 MSmits: or maybe kutulu
 MSmits: actually very many CG games

 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: but i bet it crossed his mind to say it at least once :D
 MSmits: it gets really confusing when the subject is trump. You have to try hard to make a story so ridiculous people wont think it's real
 AntiSquid: MSmits all this complaining about trump makes me wonder if people forget that Biden has dementia
 MSmits: I did not forget it
 MSmits: I really dislike that he is winning
 AntiSquid: it's like most american presidents are senile to some degree

 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:\
 AntiSquid: next month we might just get hit by an asteroid so whatever
 MSmits: I bet you cross a road without looking also :P
 AntiSquid: a car can cross the sidewalk without the driver looking, what's your point? :p
 MSmits: thats what I thought :P
 accorp: :D
 AntiSquid: in fact . there was a carer hit by a bus next to the street lights just on a street near where i live MSmits
 MSmits: a carer?
 MSmits: you mean like a nurse?
 AntiSquid: she was on the side walk
 AntiSquid: no, nurses have degrees
 AntiSquid: carers just assist
 MSmits: ahh a low level nurse
 MSmits: like wood 2
 accorp: this is getting dark pretty fast
 AntiSquid: not considered a nurse
 icecream17: wow Msmits
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: what is it icecream17
 icecream17: your comment
 AntiSquid: but the point is she was on the sidewalk when the bus hit her MSmits
 MSmits: did i say something insensitive?
 MSmits: didnt mean to
 AntiSquid: calling her wood 2 
 MSmits: oh ok, is that offensive? Many players are in wood 2
 MSmits: they are players too
 AntiSquid: i was just bringing it up to show life can screw you over regardless
 MSmits: it can yes
 AntiSquid: she is fine though
 MSmits: good
 AntiSquid: i mean she recovered
 MSmits: it's another less person in the healthcare system though... not good
 MSmits: while she recovers that is
 MSmits: all those shortages on masks and such dont help either, docs and nurses get sick too
 accorp: AntiSquid, do you fear death?
 AntiSquid: you mean if i am worried right now?
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: not at the moment anyway, but this year has been crazy
 MSmits: yes
 accorp: are you drunk right now? :D
 AntiSquid: no
 accorp: good
 MSmits: no accorp he's always like this
 AntiSquid: what are you on about accorp
 AntiSquid: lik what MSmits&#160;? you made the wood joke about someone who got hit by a bus
 MSmits: I'm just messing with you AntiSquid
 accorp: you post a lot of stuff, talking in a certain direction
 AntiSquid: i am bored
 MSmits: it's just late at night, we're tired less inhibitions, more stupid stuff said :P
 accorp: oh, I get it
 AntiSquid: find a different subject that's more entertaining and i will go along with it
 AntiSquid: i hope aliens abduct MSmits
 MSmits: being tired is like being drunk
 MSmits: me too
 AntiSquid: ya good riddance
 MSmits: btw, I have a plan for being abducted
 MSmits: I'm much smarter than all those other people
 MSmits: when I get abducted
 MSmits: I will pick up a piece of alien tech
 MSmits: off a shelf
 MSmits: and prove aliens exist
 accorp: one less person to demote me down
 accorp: i hear yoy
 accorp: you*
 AntiSquid: oh please if something like that really visits earth crossing interstellar space they could just pick up humans like rats that can't fight back
 icecream17: but why aliens do that
 MSmits: yes, but they always bring you back home after they're done with their rectal exams dont they?
 AntiSquid: idk
 AntiSquid: have no experience with such things 
 MSmits: this just hearsay ofc
 icecream17: they would have to be smart right? i wonder what aliens programmers are like.
 accorp: ffs :D
 MSmits: probably they dont have them
 Counterbalance: nor shelves
 MSmits: they just have a single neural network
 AntiSquid: icecream17 we abduct animals to experiemnt on them and tag them, so naturally one of the theories or made up stories would be about the same thing
 icecream17: what? that's horrible. now i don't like aliens.
 aangairbender: yey my c# script for merging project into single file is working

 AntiSquid: maybe they had their own human soup and suffer from some virus too icecream17
 AntiSquid: humans carry diseases too
 MSmits: MostComplicatedUsername just at this time of day
 MostComplicatedUsername: :expressionless:
 AntiSquid: MostComplicatedUsername it's ok everything is under control, i am a professional moderator
 MostComplicatedUsername: :expressionless:
 AntiSquid: and how was your day MostComplicatedUsername
 MostComplicatedUsername: Normal
 AntiSquid: wow how dull
 MSmits: dull is good
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well, school closed, not much to do
 MSmits: oh you're in school
 AntiSquid: highschool or uni&#160;?
 icecream17: I wish everyday was not a normal day. I have online learning
 ZarthaxX: closed?
 AntiSquid: might be one of your students MSmits
 ZarthaxX: not even virtual classes?
 icecream17: Ugh.
 MostComplicatedUsername: 12 grade
 MSmits: he's in the US
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes there are online classes
 MostComplicatedUsername: SHe
 MSmits: I dont have students there
 AntiSquid: hey MostComplicatedUsername do you have a lazy physics teacher that skips classes and programs bots?
 MostComplicatedUsername: No
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: oh ok
 Counterbalance: nice one
 ZarthaxX: MSmits explain
 MSmits: hey I dont just teach physics
 icecream17: i wonder where that question came from
 MSmits: what ZarthaxX
 accorp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_tEdQvFcc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr_tEdQvFcc</a>
 ZarthaxX: you are doing virtuual clases?
 ZarthaxX: classes
 icecream17: no, just assignments
 icecream17: online
 MSmits: yeah, kinda, but I am a bit lucky. I did some experiments along that line last year and the classes that are still going right now are just in that period of the year where i can use material from those experiments. Like Youtube videos
 MSmits: so i dont have to do that much
 MSmits: but i am going to write two google forms tomorrow to ask some questions during an online class (on google chat)
 MSmits: they make pictures of their homework and hand them in as well
 MSmits: written by hand ofc
 MostComplicatedUsername: Hmm
 ZarthaxX: oh nice
 MostComplicatedUsername: Seems a bit inefficient
 MSmits: physics is not that easy to do digitally
 MSmits: equations and such
 MostComplicatedUsername: What kind of hw do you give?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Like, wksts, etc...
 MSmits: we're doing biophysics now
 MSmits: mostly about human senses
 MSmits: hearing, decibel calculations etc.
 MostComplicatedUsername: But do you post problems online?
 MSmits: they have books. I refer to the chapters and problems
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ohhhhhh
 MostComplicatedUsername: I see
 MSmits: they write the answers, make a photo
 MostComplicatedUsername: Google docs?
 MSmits: we do google classroom
 MSmits: you can submit files
 MSmits: as a student
 MSmits: I check them
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ik
 MSmits: see if they did it seriously
 MostComplicatedUsername: But wouldn't google docs be easier for them?
 MSmits: dont think so
 MSmits: writing equations and calculations takes more effort
 MSmits: easier on paper
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yeah
 MostComplicatedUsername: I was just thinking of having to take a picture of each page and post it
 MSmits: there are not that many pages, 1-3 photos per week
 icecream17: lucky
 MostComplicatedUsername: yeah
 MSmits: they only have my class 3 hrs a week
 AntiSquid: 1-3 student selfies per week? Automaton2000 what's going on in this chat?
 Automaton2000: i found a bug in my code but i don't think there's a lot of fun
 JBM: streaming more Haskell editing to silence back to the same effects (or so I hope): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm/">https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm/</a>
 Zenoscave: there's tons of fun
 MSmits: per student ofc AntiSquid for that particular subject i have 47 students
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yay my bot can move randomly...
 AntiSquid: well done 
 MSmits: my CS class ends tomorrow and my graduation year physics class has also ended, because the graduation exams were cancelled
 MostComplicatedUsername: Thank you...
 MSmits: so I only work half time basically
 MostComplicatedUsername: We still have our AP exams
 MostComplicatedUsername: unfortunately
 MostComplicatedUsername: But a lot of the content was cut out, everything that would have been taught after march
 AntiSquid: some junior doctors feel a bit relieved because school is closed, more time to prepare for exams
 MSmits: makes sense, though that makes me question the effectiveness of the school
 MSmits: isnt the school supposed to prepare you for exams?
 icecream17: in texas exams are closed
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yeah
 icecream17: your in texas?
 MostComplicatedUsername: But teaching is harder
 MostComplicatedUsername: no in CA
 AntiSquid: MSmits you've been a teacher for a long time, don't you ever think that the system needs a bit of rethinking and that it's outdated?
 MostComplicatedUsername: So the college board has decided 
 MostComplicatedUsername: to cut it out
 MSmits: is texas the state where the governor or senator decided it's ok to let some old people die for the sake of the economy?
 icecream17: idk
 MSmits: AntiSquid sure, there's much to improve
 icecream17: like the cafeteria XD
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/24/covid-19-texas-official-suggests-elderly-willing-die-economy/2905990001/">https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/24/covid-19-texas-official-suggests-elderly-willing-die-economy/2905990001/</a>
 icecream17: "official-suggests-elderly-willing-die-economy" gosh...
 BeeGee: Sounds like Brazil
 MSmits: there's video too, you can probably find it on youtube... pretty sick I think
 MSmits: it's not even taken out of context or anything... that's just what some people think
 AntiSquid: ya idk, it's kinda weird and backward it's like those governments want old people to die 
 icecream17: i better check the us coronavirus thing
 MSmits: sounds like it yeah
 AntiSquid: everyone was initially boycotting china that they secretly spread the virus to have an excuse to kill dissenters and old people, but now they are quiet about their own governments 
 MSmits: on fox news they still call it the "china virus" 
 icecream17: US cases: this morning 105 thousand
 MSmits: or the "foreign virus"
 icecream17: now: 121K
 AntiSquid: MSmits i think that's irrelevant
 MSmits: like the virus has a nationality
 AntiSquid: spanish flu / china flu / uk flu / they can even call it after me, it's beside the point to argue about it
 MSmits: icecream17 yes, there's a difference between the positively tested amount and the actual amount
 ZarthaxX: icecream17 they are rockin
 MSmits: you can be sure there's many 100k's , maybe a million
 icecream17: two red comments in a row
 AntiSquid: icecream17 what's your favorite icecream
 AntiSquid: have you tried red wine ice cream?
 icecream17: mint chocolate or cookies and cream or caramel or ....i'm an 8th grader
 icecream17: When I searched google for favorite foods ice cream was there somehow that's why
 MostComplicatedUsername: ah
 icecream17: wow, now i want to eat ice cream. mmm. everyone deserrve an icecream lol
 icecream17: i realize that my "most" moves mover works the wrong way but also correctly
 MostComplicatedUsername: Should I come up with a path before the game loop and just print each item in the list during the game loops?
 icecream17: Most moves = N, -&gt; move E
 icecream17: Huh, that's an interesting idea. My thing is mostly deterministic except for charges and silence and mine.
 icecream17: Wow, no tyops this time.
 MostComplicatedUsername: YEah
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then I just have to keep track of the opponent
 MSmits: did you just make a typo in the word typo icecream17?
 MostComplicatedUsername: nice lol
 AntiSquid: typhos
 icecream17: think I would timeout if I tried to premove. Plus, I never make it to turn 600....
 MostComplicatedUsername: Well
 MostComplicatedUsername: TUrn 1
 MostComplicatedUsername: Response time is 20 times
 MostComplicatedUsername: Longer
 icecream17: Turn 0 = Start on 7th square, "2988ms"
 Counterbalance: you start measuring too soon
 Counterbalance: do it after you have read the first line of the turn input
 icecream17: "1ms"
 MostComplicatedUsername: The way I keep track of the enemy's positions
 MostComplicatedUsername: Is
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have a list of possible positions
 MostComplicatedUsername: And update it every turn
 MostComplicatedUsername: And I can narrow it ever time the opponent surfaces
 MostComplicatedUsername: every*
 MostComplicatedUsername: the problem with that is
 MostComplicatedUsername: For each "starting" position of my opponent
 icecream17: every time the opponent surfaces?
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have to have a list 
 Counterbalance: i don't have a list
 MostComplicatedUsername: And more and more lists as more paths are created
 MostComplicatedUsername: I can occasionally delete lists when some are proven impossible 
 struct: what language MostComplicatedUsername?
 icecream17: oh I do "move", "torpedo", "my torpedo", "surface", and "ohno (silence)"
 MostComplicatedUsername: Python
 icecream17: python is suppossed to be eaiser than js, but i learned js first and so python is hard.
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh
 MostComplicatedUsername: I haven't actually typed up my idea 
 icecream17: what idea?
 MostComplicatedUsername: -_-
 icecream17: I'm working on moving (still) and mine for bronze
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im in wood 2 still
 MostComplicatedUsername: I only have random moving rn
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im mainly working on CSB rn 
 icecream17: Move up if you can, then left if you can, then right if you can, then down if you can.
 MostComplicatedUsername: That's what I do
 MostComplicatedUsername: For back to the 
 MostComplicatedUsername: I mean
 MostComplicatedUsername: Tron battle
 MostComplicatedUsername: rip
 icecream17: send share
 Counterbalance: yay wood1
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443292531">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443292531</a>
 icecream17: Good job Counterbalance!
 Counterbalance: nasty bugs!
 icecream17: Take a pad and write out explanations for every major function
 MostComplicatedUsername: A pad?
 icecream17: It made me realize how bad I am.... (notepad or paper or wall, doesn't matter)
 Counterbalance: by bot keeps torpedoing itself
 icecream17: how does your torpedoing work
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Counterbalance: well enough so far, curiously enough
 icecream17: think of all the ways torpedoing can be pronounced
 Counterbalance: yeah, I wanted to write torpedoeing but not sure that's correct either
 icecream17: maybe it's just "torpedo"
 icecream17: I wish I could make my own maps
 icecream17: I can change the seed, but I don't know how the seed number works
 icecream17: seed=0000000000000000000 has islands still....
 Counterbalance: you could if you added that to the referee.. some other games have options for that
 MostComplicatedUsername: maybe 
 MostComplicatedUsername: You should\
 MostComplicatedUsername: Do an experiment
 icecream17: I looked in the code and it says it adds "random" islands so I definitely don't know how it works
 MostComplicatedUsername: Come up with
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/GridManager.java">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/GridManager.java</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: 200 random seeds
 AntiSquid: "bot keeps torpedoing itself" Counterbalance no obscenity in the chat please
 icecream17: :grinning:
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then try each out
 MostComplicatedUsername: Then figure out how the seed relates to the islands
 MostComplicatedUsername: Sigh
 MostComplicatedUsername: Automaton2000 fix AntiSquid
 Automaton2000: you are good at it
 MostComplicatedUsername: Wow thx
 icecream17: anyone in java, what does rand.nextInt(15); do?
 ZarthaxX: google it :P
 MostComplicatedUsername: learnxinyminutes.com
 icecream17: seed=0000000000000000001 is completely different!!!!!!!!
 icecream17: How am I ever going to figure this out?
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443294793">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443294793</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: First time every 
 MostComplicatedUsername: ever*
 MostComplicatedUsername: winning against the boss
 MostComplicatedUsername: My CSB code 307 lines
 MostComplicatedUsername: I could probably make it shorter
 Counterbalance: mine's 3000 lines
 Counterbalance: that could definitely be shorter&#160;:)
 MSmits: wait... your csb bot is 3000 lines&#160;!?
 Counterbalance: yup
 ZarthaxX: no bugs at all?
 MSmits: I write very long bots and mine is like 1200 lines
 MSmits: what is taking up so much space?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Dang 
 MSmits: I sometimes go over 2k with complicated games, but never 3k
 ZarthaxX: like this one
 ZarthaxX: :D
 MSmits: 1185 so far
 MSmits: but I am not tracking or using mines, not using silence or sonar either
 icecream17: wow makes my 573 lines sound bad
 Counterbalance: it has 1400 lines of shared library code with a lot of #ifdefs for different bots
 MSmits: oh, it's more than one bot
 Counterbalance: that part of the code is used in more than one bot, yes
 icecream17: I do silence or mine, randomly, if the opponent doesn't torpedo for 5+ moves
 Counterbalance: it also has local stuff, like generating an AVI replay, param fiddling etc..
 MSmits: whats an AVI replay?
 Counterbalance: video file format
 MSmits: damn
 ZarthaxX: the fuck
 MSmits: this is too pro for me
 Counterbalance: it outputs an image for each frame that gets turned into a movie using ffmpeg
 ZarthaxX: u have lots of goals MSmits
 MSmits: for this contest? Yes, my list has 12 goals currently, but those 3 are for tomorrow
 MSmits: many of the 12 goals will end up having many subgoals. Plenty to do
 MostComplicatedUsername: Counterbalance Why
 icecream17: the reason i always have something to improve on is because my code is bad
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol
 MSmits: Counterbalance how do you get the images?
 MSmits: from the referee?
 MSmits: also do you do this for every game?
 struct: wtf
 Counterbalance: no just drawn using lines and circles etc - also part of the bot
 struct: avi
 MSmits: ahh 
 struct: my current csb bot is 1700 lines with no search
 MSmits: thats because your avx code bloats things
 ZarthaxX: lol
 struct: let me check
 ZarthaxX: who has the largest code
 struct: how many lines is avx library
 struct: 900 lines
 MSmits: ah see
 icecream17: I enlarged my page size. Now *I* have the largest code!
 struct: also lots of functions i dont use
 struct: but I added them anyways
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: compiler will remove them I guess
 Counterbalance: at 8 9 my bot does MOVE S TORPEDO|TORPEDO 8 10Lost 2 lives.
 struct: self destruct
 MSmits: nice job
 Counterbalance: it's as player 2.. it's almost like... hmm
 MSmits: next turn, the other guy crashes because his tracking system can't handle your crazy
 MostComplicatedUsername: I love it when
 MostComplicatedUsername: I make the boss crash
 MSmits: Counterbalance ah i get it. Your bot thinks it's always player 1 and it tries to kill player 2 even if that's you
 Counterbalance: it looks like it
 MSmits: btw, Counterbalance, there's a Dutchie at nr 1. Let's make it a top 3 Netherlands only situation
 icecream17: "seed=1234567890123456789" seems really good for debugging
 Counterbalance: yeah i sawlet's try!
 icecream17: In bronze top 5 is all france....
 MSmits: around half the players are usually French&#160;:)
 MSmits: CG is a French company
 Zenoscave: this would be a binomial distribution. french not french
 YannT: yeah we're just more numerous really :p
 YannT: also we have recurse who counts as semi-french
 YannT: french adjacent
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443300205">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443300205</a>
 Zenoscave: Lol true
 struct: semi french
 icecream17: :grinning: 
 AntiSquid: my bot is still at &lt; 500 lines
 MSmits: good job MostComplicatedUsername, you showed him
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ik right
 icecream17: yeah
 YannT: I think he's technically french canadian, so yeah, adjacent&#160;;)
 MostComplicatedUsername: Random moving
 Zenoscave: Still only a ~3% change of the top 5 all being French if half the server is French
 MSmits: there's a selection effect though. He would only say it at the moment it is true
 YannT: Cpy. Levine really got nerfed since I saw him ahah
 MSmits: he would not also say it 97 times when it's not true
 Zenoscave: I don't understand your staement MSmits
 MSmits: the boss always blew himself up
 MSmits: Zenoscave it's like this
 YannT: didn't use too before nerf
 MSmits: the top 5 changes all day right
 YannT: he'd actually aim
 Zenoscave: Correct
 MSmits: so 3% of the time it has 5 French players
 Zenoscave: in the top 5
 MSmits: at all the times it hasn't, noone says anything
 MSmits: yes
 Zenoscave: Oh so observation bias?
 MSmits: ah yes, i should have said that
 Zenoscave: I was just going of statistics.
 MSmits: yeah
 Zenoscave: 0.5^5 = ~0.03
 MSmits: got that
 Zenoscave: Then we agree in different words
 MSmits: it would be more special if it was the top 5 in silver
 MSmits: because its more stable
 Zenoscave: True
 MSmits: bronze changes all the time because people get promoted
 Zenoscave: Plus this doesn't take effect of the distribution of French to non french player ranks
 MSmits: true
 Zenoscave: If the top players are all French it would greatly increase the distribution
 struct: We need to prevent it
 MSmits: this is also why people always think you absolutely need c++ to win a contest
 Zenoscave: I'll be right back writing a script
 MSmits: because that simply is what the top players use. Not because you can only win when you use it
 Zenoscave: I just had a brilliant idea for a Forum post
 MSmits: uh oh
 MSmits: :worried:
 Zenoscave: Gonna do a country and language Statistical ranking
 struct: This was seen before
 MSmits: ohh interesting
 struct: They used to share those stats on older contests
 YannT: real talk,  you might need C++ to rank very high in the multi games, but during a contezst language usually really isn't the limiting factor
 Zenoscave: I remember struct but did that was a static Country X ranks higher typically than country Y
 MSmits: YannT not even in all multi games. Some just dont require performance, or a small change in algorithm has such a large effect that performance effects become negligible
 YannT: true&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Plus lang wrappers...
 Zenoscave: where's the curse when this discussion pulls up
 MSmits: you can be sure that all those simple board games require c++ or similar, or wrapped
 YannT: I passed UTTT legend with Kotlin tho, and it was honestly more of a challenge because JVM, doable fore sure, just more work by default
 MSmits: I think he's avoiding CG until he has time to compete in the contest
 struct: but some really require performance
 YannT: but this is a pure optimization contest
 MSmits: it's frustrating when you have to work on other things 
 YannT: multi*
 Zenoscave: I finished midterms today.
 Zenoscave: I'm good for a week
 MSmits: grats Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: thx
 Zenoscave: but not grats. I did horribly on one
 MSmits: YannT, not entirely. There's some strategy involved as well
 struct: if there are 2 python bots at top 10
 MSmits: also some inefficiency in your algorithm may make it 10x slower whereas c++ only gives a 2 or 3x boost
 Zenoscave: 65/100 was my score. dropped me from an A to barely above D
 struct: its not all about performance
 MSmits: as long as you pass Zenoscave
 MSmits: you'll never look back at these scores. What you take with you is your degree and what you learned
 Zenoscave: I learned not to take a networks class online
 Zenoscave: Ironically
 MSmits: oh, sounds like my internet security class
 MSmits: I am finishing that in 2 weeks
 Zenoscave: Just OSI models TCP protos and other such nonsense
 MSmits: had to do a ddos attack last week
 Zenoscave: you did UDP yes?
 struct: so we found out who took cg chat down
 YannT: MSmits: on UTTT very little, it's mostly optimization
 MSmits: yeah UDP TCP
 MSmits: YannT, not entirely though. You can easily get to legend with good optim and mcts with totally random rollout
 MSmits: you can be sure that's not what the top 10 does. They have more tricks
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: but yea, forget this with java
 MSmits: even the tricks wont help you enough
 struct: if my bot had 80k rolouts i probably would only climb to top 30
 MSmits: top 30 sounds about right yes
 YannT: well,  I did legend on JVM, and my point is that was more  work that would have been required on other languages
 MSmits: my bot has 90-130k
 MSmits: and if i submit it now it's nr 1
 MSmits: but waiting on some more improvements
 MSmits: i did legend on C# YannT
 MSmits: but converted after
 YannT: case in  point&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes
 YannT: many multi are not optim ones tho
 YannT: that one clearly is!
 MSmits: it is probably the most extreme example
 MSmits: oware would be another
 MSmits: bandas probably
 MSmits: yavalath not so much
 YannT: and, that level of oiptim really doesn't exist during contests (unless you aim for #1)
 YannT: so language is not limiting on contests, generally speaking
 MSmits: depends on the contest
 YannT: it only is for ranking first on multi :p
 MSmits: I'm pretty sure I had the most optimized bot on code a la mode in the top 10. But I was only rank 8 and the nr 1 was completely heuristic :P
 struct: I think Bit runner is one of the multi its impossible to get legend without c++
 MSmits: yeah might be true struct
 smeagol: Hi
 struct: hi
 smeagol: MSmits: do you use simulation algos&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, but that's a very broad question
 YannT: MSmits: again, case in point&#160;;)
 Counterbalance: STC is also a good candidate
 aangairbender: i guess this contest was meant
 struct: no Counterbalance you are mistaken
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl has a very high rank in STC
 YannT: maybe as a multi getting to the top will require crazy performance and an assembly bot or something, but during a contest it generally doesn't really matter
 struct: C# bot of euler places around same rank as his c++ bot
 smeagol: STC&#160;? STMC
 MSmits: he is not known for writing super optimized bots
 MSmits: maybe he did that time though, not sure
 smeagol: searc tree monte carlo?
 struct: I think he has around 600k sims
 smeagol: 600k: it's very much
 MSmits: smeagol in this contest? No, not mcts
 smeagol: AG
 struct: we were talking about STC
 smeagol: MC
 struct: smash the code
 MSmits: just processing opponent orders eliminating possible locations and paths and such
 YannT: I think in the current contest everyone is heuristic (or close to it)
 smeagol: MS: this heuristic algo
 smeagol: for navigation, what are you using algo&#160;?
 smeagol: the most path doesn't work
 YannT: minimize ennemy detection
 smeagol: beaucause it eliminate the most possibities
 YannT: (and available space after move)
 smeagol: whith degree
 YannT: taking a path that visits every cell is actually not a good idea
 YannT: the best idea is to sometimes eat a surface to have better tiles
 YannT: (well, it is a good first idea, but you come back from it)
 smeagol: better tiles (in french&#160;?)
 smeagol: Salut MAD
 smeagol: comment vas tu?
 YannT: minimise la détection ennemie et fait des mouvements qui te laissent le plus de cases dispo pour après  ;)
 YannT: (sorry)
 smeagol: le plus de cases&#160;: c'est toujours le meme nombre
 smeagol: ah oui je voix
 YannT: you try not to cut the map
 smeagol: pour les mouvements suivants
 YannT: yes
 smeagol: merci YannT
 MSmits: gonna get some sleep, gn
 YannT: gn man
 ZarthaxX: gn!
 FloopyBirdMan: you are a buttcheak
 smeagol: gn!
 MostComplicatedUsername: hum
 MostComplicatedUsername: I can't really think of a good strategy for moving
 BenjaminUrquhart: have you tried
 BenjaminUrquhart: moving
 MostComplicatedUsername: YEs
 MostComplicatedUsername: Rn just random movement
 MostComplicatedUsername: Seems to work well enough&#160;;)
 MostComplicatedUsername: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443310969">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443310969</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: But I need something
 MostComplicatedUsername: That 
 MostComplicatedUsername: Wait
 MostComplicatedUsername: lemme rephrase
 MostComplicatedUsername: I need some way to move that increases the amount of time before I surface
 aangairbender: go to the cell that gives the most flood value
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;???
 aangairbender: by flood value I mean how many connected free cells are there from next cell
 MostComplicatedUsername: English please
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh
 MostComplicatedUsername: I see
 MostComplicatedUsername: But that...
 MostComplicatedUsername: Takes work
 MostComplicatedUsername: And im lazy
 MostComplicatedUsername: So I'll probably start trying
 MostComplicatedUsername: but then stop
 aangairbender: 20 lines of floodfill
 aangairbender: just bfs
 MostComplicatedUsername: I have no idea how to do any of that
 BenjaminUrquhart: keep in mind my bot is broken as hell rn<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443312702">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443312702</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im a nub
 MostComplicatedUsername: Hmmm how do you keep track of opponent?
 BenjaminUrquhart: process of elimination
 BenjaminUrquhart: and hoping I don't divide by zero again
 MostComplicatedUsername: My idea is to keep track of possible paths the opponent is taking and use POE 
 aangairbender: keep all possible enemy positions
 aangairbender: and update them after enemy moves
 MostComplicatedUsername: Now I just have to write the code
 aangairbender: right
 MostComplicatedUsername: Argh
 MostComplicatedUsername: My least favorite part
 BenjaminUrquhart: my tracker breaks when tracking torpedos, so that's fun
 MostComplicatedUsername: Why bother tracking torpedoes? They're instantaneous, right?
 BenjaminUrquhart: well because the opponent needs to be within 4 units
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh I see
 MostComplicatedUsername: So you can narrow the opponent's position
 BenjaminUrquhart: exactly
 MostComplicatedUsername: Manhattan distance is annoying
 BenjaminUrquhart: just bfs
 BenjaminUrquhart: smh
 aangairbender: abs(ax - bx) + abs(bx - by)
 aangairbender: easy
 aangairbender: i meant ay - by
 BenjaminUrquhart: I mean
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 MostComplicatedUsername: what is ay?
 MostComplicatedUsername: And by?
 MostComplicatedUsername: confused
 aangairbender: coordinates
 MostComplicatedUsername: Oh wait
 MostComplicatedUsername: Im dum
 BenjaminUrquhart: a and b are the 2 points you are comparing
 aangairbender: a.x a.y b.x b.y
 MostComplicatedUsername: Ik
 MostComplicatedUsername: The variable names messed me up\
 MostComplicatedUsername: We don't recieve opponent starting position, right? That would be too easy
 BenjaminUrquhart: nope
 MostComplicatedUsername: receive*
 MostComplicatedUsername: ok
 BenjaminUrquhart: games would end in like 20 frames
 MostComplicatedUsername: yeah

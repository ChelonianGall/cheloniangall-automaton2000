 Peached: and first time 2nd les go
 phoenixcrow: i dont understand how all game work
 FleuryBoy: guys, i already beat the first bot in the spring challenge contest
 FleuryBoy: but they didnt upgrade my league
 FleuryBoy: i already battled multiple times
 FleuryBoy: won all my battles
 KiwiTae: u need to submit
 KiwiTae: your code in the arena
 FleuryBoy: i already did
 FleuryBoy: in te arena
 FleuryBoy: beat everyone
 FleuryBoy: im on top of my league
 KiwiTae: nop
 FleuryBoy: im second
 KiwiTae: you are 2points behind Benoi
 KiwiTae: and whats the boss score?
 FleuryBoy: but that shouldnt matter
 FleuryBoy: because they say that the ones better than the bot will upgrade
 KiwiTae: whats the boss score?
 FleuryBoy: less than mine
 KiwiTae: how much? hehe
 FleuryBoy: 6 points
 FleuryBoy: i have 25
 FleuryBoy: the bot has 19,52
 KiwiTae: :fearful:
 Peached: finally im off 8k on clash of code
 derjack: :tada:
 Peached: now imma try to solve this ascii art
 Peached: puzzle thing
 Peached: (instant confusion)
 Peached: YOO ALL OF A SUDDEN IM 5K WHAT
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey there.
 Peached: hai
 Peached: im on a impossible clash rn it has problems so bad
 Peached: imma just get 20% of it and S U B M I T
 Peached: and i got 0% wtf
 Peached: weirdo clasher
 Peached: dawdsjdowldmadkdce

 struct: hi
 KiwiTae: o/
 struct: hi KiwiTae are you still working on hypersonic?
 Nguyen_SoCute: hello
 Wontonimo: oi
 struct: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hey struct&#160;!
 Wontonimo: I have successfully converted 3 CoC'ers to multis this week.  I should get a badge
 struct: lol nice
 Illedan: :star:
 struct: yesterday i sucesfully revived my c4 bot
 Wontonimo: look at it, proudly high on the leaderboard.  What the heck is Robo doing different?
 struct: he has NN
 Wontonimo: I'm a bit frustrated that I can't get my UTTT bot any higher.  I'm kinda out of bullets.  Perhaps a transposition table or node reuse table?
 struct: node reuse?
 Wontonimo: an inferior version of transposition tables, which only looks at exact board/move matches
 Wontonimo: i just made up "node reuse", it's not an official term
 struct: i feel like its one of those games where its hard to improve
 Wontonimo: it is, for sure.  it's been a crazy amount of effort to climb from 38th to 28th
 struct: if I were you I would try another multi
 struct: Sometimes you might get another ideas and then apply them there
 struct: its what happened for me on c4
 struct: I found this when I was doing breakthrough
 Wontonimo: you and me are thinking the same thing
 struct: then I aplied it on c4
 Marchete: :notebook::soccer:
 struct: :fire:
 Wontonimo: are you using transposition tables for C4?
 struct: no
 struct: mcts solver with smart rollouts
 struct: and higher rollout count than the average
 Wontonimo: thanks
 struct: and opening book that is book = {7}&#160;:)
 struct: just 1 move for first turn
 struct: cant really be called a book
 Wontonimo: yeah, i saw that.  It would be great if UTTT also had that steal option to balance the opening
 Wontonimo: more like a leaflet 
 struct: Im sure if you port your uttt mcts to c4
 struct: you get top 20
 Wontonimo: yup
 derjack: node reuse? like tree reuse from previous turn?
 martinpapa69: or more like a node storage where you put back nodes you dont need anymore
 derjack: node pool?
 Wontonimo: in the event you've come to the same board configuration, reuse the cooresponding node in your MCTS
 Wontonimo: it therefore benefits from not having to divide the learnings from rollouts between two areas of the tree
 derjack: so, transposition table
 Wontonimo: right, but without symmetry transformations 
 Wontonimo: i thought transposition tables usually included symmetry transformations
 Wontonimo: or do you skip that?
 Wontonimo: or is symmetry transformation usually considered "extra" on top of transposition&#160;?
 RoboStac: extra - lots of games have no symmetry but benefit from transposition tables (eg chess)
 Wontonimo: excellent, thanks
 martinpapa69: I've too thought about that kind of node reusage. doesn't look trivial to implement tho
 struct: i would not try it on c4
 Peached: hi
 RoboStac: I would have thought c4 would be good for it, it has a lot of reused positions
 derjack: the are not many transpositions in uttt anyway
 struct: maybe, but I still think its not trivial to use with mcts
 Peached: i finally got off 6k place in clash of code
 martinpapa69: one thing is cool about it, it could be merget with the neural network cache. the outputs could be stored on the nodes
 martinpapa69: oh, i dont even need nn cache in that case. nvm
 martinpapa69: one thing i dont know if i backprock. i would be smart to count all parants
 martinpapa69: and backprop to all of them
 martinpapa69: so instead of having a Node* parant, having a vector&lt;Node*&gt; parents, and call backprop on every parent
 derjack: afaik robo is using nncache in oware
 derjack: well if nn stuff is expensive, why not reuse it
 derjack: no transpositions in oware until endgames loops though
 RoboStac: yeah, but I still have separate nodes for each state
 Wontonimo: hey Peached, have you tried competing in the bot battles? 
 Wontonimo: Peached , do you think you could steer a pod better than these guys <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572892061">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572892061</a>&#160;?
 Peached: yea i did
 Peached: im in liek bronze league rn
 Peached: lemme see the link
 Wontonimo: yeah, you are higher than them
 Peached: yep
 Wontonimo: what do you think you could do to predict that your pod is about to hit the checkpoint, and if so to target the next checkpoint?
 Wontonimo: so as to drift into the current checkpoint by turning in advance
 derjack: -3vel eh
 Wontonimo: oh, that too
 Wontonimo: but i usually try and get people to use -1vel first and have them find 3 by themselves
 jrke: -3vel easy pzy top gold
 jrke: top gold like top 1000 i think
 Wontonimo: Peached, have you heard of -3v&#160;?
 Wontonimo: PM me if you want more details
 Peached: no clue
 Peached: probally shouldnt do clash of code rn and ruin my ranking imma message u
 schachmatt: did the power of thor golf challenge get re-run recently?
 antiwonto: why you ask?
 schachmatt: my solution went from 100% to 75% without me changing anything
 eulerscheZahl: and i climbed a lot of ranks
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think it was rerun a few weeks(?) ago
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes CG adds/changes validators to prevent hardcoding

 ericmp33: im new
 jacek: a chat
 ericmp33: bruh
 AlecMan: Yeah it's a chat
 ericmp33: but if u ask what is this chat, u can't answer is a chat
 ericmp33: is redundant
 eulerscheZahl: it's a chat for the whole website
 eulerscheZahl: there are others for certain languages such as #rf #ru #de
 ericmp33: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: and there is a discord independently from this chat
 ricknardo: Greetings, just a friendly reminder to stay hydrated. Please, drink wanter now if you are able to.
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, thanks. my bottle is right next to me
 Astrobytes: same
 ericmp33: xd
 dbdr: what's in your bottles though?
 eulerscheZahl: tap water
 AstroHydes: Also tap water for me
 AstroHydes: woops, wrong window :D
 eulerscheZahl: why the account switch?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 ericmp33: if i drink the tap water we have here, i die in 15 days xdddd, not drinkable
 AstroHydes: I'm doing stuff in this one and tabbing between them, gets confusing at times!
 eulerscheZahl: is it me or is the user info on mouse-over not working?
 Astrobytes: Getting the same actually
 struct: in chat yeah
 struct: i guess we all tried to mouse-over the same person
 ericmp33: how can i check my previous solved puzzles?
 ericmp33: puzzles/exercises idk how u call them

 eulerscheZahl: or did you play clashes? then you can't see it
 ericmp33: i think i did both
 ericmp33: thanks btw
 ericmp33: in this one, when the loop breaks? like i see while true in java, but no break (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/onboarding">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/onboarding</a>)
 ericmp33: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/424c9209-06e7-4930-b3e5-f237a7c13be0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/424c9209-06e7-4930-b3e5-f237a7c13be0</a>
 eulerscheZahl: while(true) is fine here on CodinGame
 eulerscheZahl: in each iteration you will read input and write output
 Astrobytes: it runs as long as it receives input from stdin
 eulerscheZahl: an external program will feed your code. and kill the process when it's done
 ericmp33: oh
 ericmp33: but wouldnt be better use sc.hasNext() in java for example? or how could i stop it?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to stop it. CodinGame will do this for you
 ericmp33: okay yeah, but was an assumption of how could i do it coding it in my machine
 ericmp33: a guess*
 dbdr: imagine the millions of bots still running
 xxd: i have this odd issue where in CoC where the page freezes when a clash starts, i need to refresh the page to view the problem/IDE
 eulerscheZahl: only Stilgart's bot refused to die at some point
 dbdr: how could he tell?
 Stilgart: \o
 ericmp33: i solved it, just changed while (true) to while (sc.hasNext()) c:
 Astrobytes: that was tricky to get to the bottom of iirc
 Astrobytes: Something to do with threading?
 dbdr: ssh my_bot@codingame.com
 Stilgart: not my fault if CG does weird things with threads&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hehehe

 aetrnm: Oh Astrobytes, you are still alive UwU
 Maxim251: Please read that, There is question wht array cant be initiate
 aetrnm: Haven't been for 3 month on a website
 Maxim251: If I want initialise "MARK place[3][3] = { none};" then why I get wired output? 
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/42875bdb-7a16-4ab3-a59c-379b8afbc05d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/42875bdb-7a16-4ab3-a59c-379b8afbc05d</a>
 ANONYMOUS42: is that in C?
 aetrnm: If it's C, then None with capital, but I am note sure whether it exists in pure C...
 struct: thats how it works
 struct: if you do int arr[6] = {1};
 struct: only the first 1 will be 1, rest will be 0
 struct: which is the default value
 Maxim251: C++
 struct: you can do enum MARK {none, X, O };
 struct: then 0 will equal none
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: that will work, anything else you risk garbage
 Maxim251: Thats wired, I always was sure that it will initiate all array 
 Maxim251: @struct yeah, I think this could be easy solution, is good that is initializing with 0 value and not mess leaved from memory.
 Maxim251: Now I know, to never again do it like this int value[8][8] = {3}; and I will do it manually from for loop
 struct: for loop works
 jacek: does it work for other things?
 Astrobytes: 'other things'...
 jacek: other than loop
 Astrobytes: hm?
 Astrobytes: what do you mean?
 jacek:  
 jacek: ok ill shut my mouth :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: were you trolling?
 jacek: no
 Astrobytes: do you mean the {} initializer syntax?
 Astrobytes: Oh well. Unexplained questions never get answered :P
 jacek: initializing 2d array with {} is more tricky no?
 juice0: you have to do {{}} right?
 jacek: i think so?
 Astrobytes: For anything other than 0 value it's safer to use a loop
 Astrobytes: There are ways
 Astrobytes: But it depends what you want the value to be
 Astrobytes: iirc memset works for 0 or -1, anything else needs a loop
 juice0: yep i do <a href="/index.php?title=Template:0&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:0 (page does not exist)">Template:0</a> with maximum confidence for me, which is about 1%
 aetrnm: *int arr[6] = {1};only the first 1 will be 1, rest will be 0which is the default value*Values that are not defined can contain garbage, which is rare, but can happen. For newbies such a details are important, as it is a basis for understanding of evething
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I would definitely recommend looking into memory allocation and memory in general, since it fundamental for arrays
 aetrnm: Tbh, I have been solving programming tasks with C++ for 3 years so far, and I am always using  vectors. Even though they are slower, if you don't want to fk brains with memory, it's really a good option, especially because Codingame does not have 1s time limitation
 Astrobytes: It's different when you're doing bot programming
 Astrobytes: I mean STL vectors are fine if you reserve the size and don't change it
 Astrobytes: but when you have 50-100ms per turn and no command line optimization, you have to use the pragmas
 Astrobytes: and sometimes arrays too
 Astrobytes: implement your own vector class or whatever
 aetrnm: Nah, once I tried to override standard vector in C++, according to my task, that was crazy
 aetrnm: Just C++ is not for everyone&#160;:)
 Maxim251: I have another problem, in Montecarlo tree search, I have base class on wich I will generate child class, in my mind is like multiverse in LOKI series in Avengers, My question is that when I create obiect in side obiect, it will happen for ever. How I can limit that, or how I can track multilayer arrays of class?
 jacek: you have nodes in your node class?
 Astrobytes: You may be overcomplicating things a little
 Astrobytes: @Maxim251
 Maxim251: That class is a node, but this node is base node, because I am create it, but in side that class I want create copy of its one, where will create copy of that board and fill up next choice.
 therealbeef: sounds like composite design pattern
 Maxim251: that class is... I try explain as easy as posible how I try desighn that class...
 Maxim251: struct MAP
 Maxim251: create board[3][3];
 Maxim251: vector&lt; pair&lt;int, int&gt;
 jacek: time flies eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/axMex3n_460svav1.mp4">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/axMex3n_460svav1.mp4</a>
 Maxim251: as avaible moves
 Astrobytes: Right, so you have a Node class. Your root node is an instance of that. From there you expand that node - you give it children, more instances of that same Node class, who are created from applying available moves
 Maxim251: yes... 
 Maxim251: I never do that previously, and I am bit confused how I should do that...
 Maxim251: I know that clas should contain whole logic to figureout next move and if is win or lose
 Maxim251: Or do I need move all functions out side of node class and inherit them apart?
 jacek: logic is done outside the class
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: class is has just state/move, wins/ visits, children and optionally parent
 Maxim251: Do someone can help me in C++ ... help me write base code? On private chat, that I will get glimps of how that desighn should look? Because now I feel like I go thru black room, 
 sapfeer0k: the website's js is broken.
 sapfeer0k: Possibly unhandled rejection: {"id":-2} undefined in browser console
 Maxim251: I  want learn Montecarlo tree search on Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe because board is small and I think it will be easier to me to understand
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c565ae3d-f476-45cc-9730-7c94b761f7e0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c565ae3d-f476-45cc-9730-7c94b761f7e0</a>
 Astrobytes: there is a naive example
 Astrobytes: Maxim251: I would try to learn it on regular TicTacToe first
 Maxim251: Ok, then I go first there, if I found...
 Astrobytes: We don't have it on here, other than a puzzle version. But it's easy to code by yourself
 Maxim251: Ok, logic it self is easy . But that game give me 2 moves of O, and my answere should be where is the winning move, But I need something to start from scrach using Montecarlo, like Othello game, where I try use old fashion code. And I get only 111 in ranking, and i think others was using tree search to predict future moves.
 Astrobytes: I am suggesting to code tictactoe and use monte carlo tree search to play it.
 therealbeef: the wood league of UTTT is regular tic tac toe, no?
 Astrobytes: Hm yes, I think so
 Maxim251: Yes, I have wood tictactoe only 1 board... Thats why I did not write simple code to pass wood league, and thats why I want learn tree search on that simple board. 
 therealbeef: good idea
 Astrobytes: Yes stay with the simple board
 Maxim251: In othello board is to big, and I leaved that , because I want first learn how code tree search.
 Astrobytes: have you learned minimax w/ alphabeta pruning, and even random (monte carlo method, no tree) searches?
 jacek: start with the simulation: board state, list all available moves, makeMove, undoMove, isGameOver, getWinner
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7b54a29e-533d-4f45-a8e8-0ce3d1fb8476">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7b54a29e-533d-4f45-a8e8-0ce3d1fb8476</a>
 Astrobytes: Are you familiar with tree data structures in general?
 Maxim251: NO
 Astrobytes: OK, well I'd get learning about binary trees first and work your way from there. It will help a lot
 Maxim251: ps, I know that node should contain array? Because board have 9 fields, and each choice begins from diferent field?
 TobiasA: what is the largest depth you guys have ever used for minimax on coding game? that actually works?
 jacek: i think i had around 14 in oware when using negamax
 jacek: and more near endgame
 Astrobytes: No idea. Mostly I use iterative deepening, I don't always check the depth
 TobiasA: 14:fearful:
 TobiasA: i see
 jacek: welp there are at most 6 moves
 Astrobytes: and higher yes, depends on pruning tricks and other search techniques
 TobiasA: that means it is me who is doing something wrong 
 Astrobytes: which game?
 TobiasA: depth of 1 times out for me
 TobiasA: tron
 Astrobytes: You're doing something wrong
 TobiasA: mhm
 Astrobytes: Maybe another game is better to try minimax first
 TobiasA: any suggestions?
 Maxim251: ok, I have node based at using pointers and 'new' key word
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3be42ae-afcc-427d-8982-b427960d8bb9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3be42ae-afcc-427d-8982-b427960d8bb9</a>
 Maxim251: But when I think about it, there should be posible to use vector?
 jacek: depth 1 timeouts? then it is likely some crash
 Maxim251: vector will alowed me to iterate from all instances in simpler way.. I am going in good direction?
 Maxim251: This site show me basics how manually create tree of nodes, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-1-introduction/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-1-introduction/</a>
 Maxim251: how I can create automatycally growing node untill some rulls will stop it?
 Astrobytes: but have you practiced that?
 Maxim251: To practice, first I need to know how do it, other wise I will code blindly and waisting a lot of time, where at the end it will be so simple...
 Maxim251: I dont want lern it in hard way, thats why I try ask You gus for help
 Astrobytes: Sorry but you really need to learn the basics of building tree data structures
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0794f50d-801c-4348-8b22-26f6564fc74d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0794f50d-801c-4348-8b22-26f6564fc74d</a>
 Astrobytes: there's no quick fix
 Maxim251: this is simple. But I never do auto growing node, 
 Astrobytes: afk, back later
 Maxim251: This link show manually creating tree, like:node = create node,node-&gt;node-&gt;node-&gt;node = create new node....In auto growing node this type is without sense... And function to create node should be in side of that node, 
 Maxim251: then I will get problem, how to prevent to growing tree for ever, 
 Maxim251: Also coming to my head is problem of counting deph, 
 Maxim251: My aproach was something like this:
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/857166e6-284e-43ae-ba7f-419bf648e4a4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/857166e6-284e-43ae-ba7f-419bf648e4a4</a>
 Maxim251: This aproach will be good?

 Maxim251: I try play with nodes, And happly I get what I want, but more interesting is that output what I get is something what I was suprised.
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5ad8b1c-40fd-4a1e-90ce-9d0ee07fef09">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5ad8b1c-40fd-4a1e-90ce-9d0ee07fef09</a>
 Maxim251: This line is very interesting, left = new Node( layer ) Is creating new nodes until reach desire amount, and then next line is outputted, Is going in oposite direction
 Maxim251: Output looks like that&#160;:
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/027db5c2-2da4-40d7-84e6-499d0954869d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/027db5c2-2da4-40d7-84e6-499d0954869d</a>
 Mochlek: so 
 Mochlek: how is your life
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Maxim251: By accident now I know to make all logic before creating next layer, and use that last line to return interesting me value? Or I can do logic after creation of node, but that will happened bacuard? 
 Maxim251: Ps, I should use also delete&#160;? because I use pointers and new keyword/
 Maxim251:&#160;?
 struct: usually you do
 struct: but on cg I dont use delete
 struct: I create a memory pool for the nodes
 struct: and then use the nodes in that pool
 Maxim251: I was just reading about chunk alocation... I think I understand how You use in Your code... Hmmm... Interesting aproach.. Rather to delete every seccond 1 node, You delete whole chunk at the end...  Do I am corect?
 Maxim251: sorr, memory pool
 struct: yes when program ends
 struct: This is used mostly for performance reasons
 struct: at least here
 struct: If you are starting to learn how to program
 struct: You dont need to do this
 Maxim251: Only problem is that when I want create size for my nodes, I need first know how many of my nodes will be sored,&#160;?
 struct: yes, usually I store like 40'000'000
 struct: I never end up needing all of them
 Maxim251: Yes, of course, is good to know that stuff... 
 Maxim251: :blush:
 Maxim251: Its like array and moving 1 pointer in fixt amount of bits
 Maxim251: uff, Thanks for help, now I understand how create tree of nodes.&#160;:)

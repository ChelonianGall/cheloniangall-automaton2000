 ASM_MOV_INT: I love clash, because you can see other's code after it's complete, and if you understand their solution.... if it's different approach, it's nice to have that in your mind
 koiee: yeah me too, but as an not active user herethere should be a question difficulty level selector
 koiee: we just want to clash code with my friends
 koiee: is there a website that we can select difficulty level of question
 One-Six: Yeah, that would be nice for private clash...
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: hey, does anyone know if you can read &amp; write files from your computer to your programs for codingame projects?
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: Or some other way to store data between runs of a program?
 Wontonimo: how's the NN stuff going?
 struct: I paused it for a bit during backpropagation
 struct: its a bit confusing
 dmuraco: what's for dinner?
 dooge: eheheh
 dooge: aahahahahhahah
 dooge: l
 dooge: ll
 koiee: hi
 koiee: how can we get harder questions in private clash
 ASM_MOV_INT: ...there is no way to determine or select difficulty in the clashes, as far as I've ever known
 ASM_MOV_INT: the rating system helps them determine that behind the scenes for the selection process

 One-Six:&#160;?
 MrZee: I have absolutely no idea lol, it just happened
 MrZee: I used shift enter to write on a new line and that's how it came out
 One-Six: testa second line
 One-Six: hmm...
 One-Six: perhaps it's not long enough
 One-Six: But, yes, classic programing
 One-Six: take down one bug, another arises
 MrZee: It's especially annoying when the program involves a lot of math that must be redone by hand to see where the operation is failing lol
 One-Six: ohno
 TFeld: If the chat message is long enough, it's put into a pastebin

 RajdeepBiswas: The sound alerts on this site could be a little more dampened so its not as much piercing to headphone users. What do you guys think?
 5DN1L: read the solution here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/allow-user-to-disable-or-adjust-volume-on-clash-of-code-countdown-bell/194450">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/allow-user-to-disable-or-adjust-volume-on-clash-of-code-countdown-bell/194450</a>
 RajdeepBiswas: It's just straight up muting the sound. I still want sound effect; just need an option for a gentler one. Thanks anyway!
 5DN1L: You may try browser addons which can adjust sound volume on individual tabs in a browser
 Miki09: Can someone please tell me what's wrong with my code in minesweeper?
 ReinJaks: why in minesweeper the cell always return "?" wherever you are?
 Miki09: "?" means that you dont know what's in this cell
 Uljahn: "Your first action will always reveal multiple cells at once."
 Uljahn: so reveal some random cell first, then read the inputs
 Miki09: Can someone please tell me what's wrong with my code in minesweeper?
 DethHarmonik: me what's wrong with my code in minesweeper?
 ReinJaks: thx uljahn!
 Uljahn: Miki09: why don't you want to use this learning opportunity yourself?
 RajdeepBiswas: Just curious, when does one become a moderator?
 Miki09: Because I'm struggling on my code SOOOOOO long and I still don't know what's wrong
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a min troll level required RajdeepBiswas. Note there's also a max troll level and you can lose the mod status if you go above.
 ReinJaks: the icarus disease of the moderators
 Uljahn: RajdeepBiswas: it all depends on admins decision to promote old-time users
 MrZee: So what you're saying is that mods need to keep their trolling......in moderation
 DethHarmonik: :clap:
 DeadSpark: e
 RajdeepBiswas: *begins trolling aggressive*
 RajdeepBiswas: *but not too aggresively*
 5DN1L: that's not the way

 5DN1L: i can never understand it either
 Uljahn: it's not fun enough when "this is NOT a problem"
 Quidome: it's getting to a point where it is annoying actually
 geek_in_code: agree
 5DN1L: obviously they have a very different idea in their minds
 Quidome: yes I see, but do that somewhere else please
 Uljahn: this might be considered as a challenge by those "edgy" kiddos, kinda forbidden fruit
 linjoehan: Hey is the minesweeper thin over already?

 fpackard: Question re shortest clash of code - someone used an online tool to minify their Python solution, which basically turns it into an unreadable string of bytes wrapped in an exec()
 fpackard: Is this legal? It seems somewhat cheat-y to me.
 5DN1L: CG doesn't disallow it
 fpackard: OK, good to know. Thanks.
 Miki09: fpackard I've already asked Thibaud and he said it was legal. But you can ask too&#160;:-)
 fpackard: No worries, I believe you&#160;:)
 fpackard: Personally I feel like it sort of defeats the purpose of the 'share code' button - in that people can read your solution and learn from it. But I don't make the rules!
 5DN1L: you can still read it and decode it haha
 5DN1L: not that i use the minifier myself
 fpackard: True - though I don't know about anyone else, but I really couldn't be bothered doing that&#160;:) 
 5DN1L: fair enough&#160;:)
 5DN1L: and i can't be bothered using the minifier as well
 5DN1L: just knowing how the trick works is good enough
 fpackard: Yeah, it's a pretty clever idea
 fpackard: Just not something I would personally want to use
 5DN1L: right
 HideLord: Btw I've seen a lot of people solving shortest mode with some kind of compression on the code and then executing the bytes
 HideLord: how is this done?

 5DN1L: 24 doesn't mean post 24
 5DN1L: it's just part of the url i copied
 5DN1L: read the whole post
 5DN1L: whole thread, i mean

 RajdeepBiswas: Oh, what happened?
 Astrobytes: Spinal/bone issues. Long story.
 RajdeepBiswas: Take care, man
 RajdeepBiswas: Whats the recovery ETA?
 derjack: oO
 Astrobytes: Well, still waiting on a bone density scan among other things, everything delayed because of the virus
 Astrobytes: so no idea really
 Astrobytes: It had better be soon though!!
 5DN1L: hope it'll go well for you!
 RajdeepBiswas: feel better, man
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I don't need these kind of issues at my age, feel like a pensioner
 RajdeepBiswas: curious, whats your age (bracket)?
 Astrobytes: 39
 RajdeepBiswas: ah
 RajdeepBiswas: its scary tbh
 KiwiTae: pretty old for a cat&#160;:) hey Astrobytes o/
 Astrobytes: No one told my bones apparently, they think they're 79 :rofl:

 nulte: drjack
 KalamariKing: RajdeepBiswas euler does
 KalamariKing: its pretty useful yea
 RajdeepBiswas: very useful indeed, thanks @5DN1L
 RajdeepBiswas: also, why doesnt codingame have its own lookup feature at least

 FluffyToaster: Hey quick question about a bot programming contest (Great Escape). I'm currently better than the boss, and have been for a few hours, but I haven't been upranked yet. The "those better than the boss will be promoted" time has passed a few times already. Any idea what's going on?
 Wontonimo: are you higher on the leaderboard&#160;?
 Uljahn: resubmit or ask [CG]Thibaud to promote you manually
 FluffyToaster: I resubmitted this morning, but I'll try it again
 FluffyToaster: And yes Wonto I am
 jacek: there seem some problems with promoting randomly lately eh
 Uljahn: promotions are buggy, ye

 struct: ok finally added TT for repetition
 struct: unordered map was very slow for me for some reason
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wontonimo tell me about cats
 jacek: :unamused:
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: what?
 struct: When even jacek reacts you know something is wrong
 jacek: oh my
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: thanks for the info
 struct: jacek I decided to not hash the state, instead I store it and just compare it, is this a bad idea?
 struct: the 3fold repetition table should be small anyways
 ninjadip: folding steel is hard
 Wontonimo: how do you do the lookup in a fast way if you don't hash struct?
 struct: just a for loop I check all current entries
 struct: it was faster than unordered map
 struct: at least for me
 struct: Maybe I did something wrong
 Wontonimo: i wouldn't use an unordered map.  i'd use a static array, and the index is the hash
 jacek: just like that c4 solver
 struct: how does that work?
 jacek: well comparing states shouldnt be that expensive if you use bitboards
 struct: yeah my state is only 2 U64
 jacek: i.e.  you use array of 2**24 entries. so hash&#160;% 2**24 is your inde
 jacek: x
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/07-transposition-table/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/07-transposition-table/</a>
 struct: I see
 struct: I think I remember coding something similar
 struct: but with buckets inside the TT
 struct: in case the hash&#160;% 1&lt;&lt;24 repeated but state would be different
 Wontonimo: if the data structure in the TT also includes the game state, then you can use the hash lookup to quickly get to the TT then double check the game state to make sure it isn't a false match
 struct: yeah I think this is what the buckets were for
 Wontonimo: how do buckets work?
 struct: struct TT{Entry entries[size][buckets]
 struct: then if hash%size you check all the stuff inside it
 struct: for the size that it currently has
 jacek: few states per hash
 Wontonimo: ah
 jacek: :taco: Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [automated] jacek has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 53 tacos. jacek now has 13 tacos
 Wontonimo: so if you have 8 buckets, you could instead have a hash that is 8 times larger with no buckets
 jacek: and also slower insert/load
 Wontonimo: slower without buckets?
 jacek: with
 Wontonimo: right, linearly with size of bucket
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: hm, what kind of code does fnf use?
 Wontonimo: assembly
 Wontonimo: i'm not wrong

 jacek: it burns gpus
 Rebollo: does seem to use ray cast, why it would?
 Alshock: hm, that's not what I was thinking of, but I can't find it easily
 Rebollo: raycast is more related to trigonnometry, like line intersections and thing like that
 struct: linux jacek?
 Wontonimo: like raycasting for gpus and lighting?
 Rebollo: yes and fire guns

 BadBurger: dam, i knew you could use kotlin to make android apps, didnt know it has surpassed java in developement for android. its been 4years ago when i llast read about kotlin. tried to make a app for fun during the weekend, and was supriced how easy it was
 BadBurger: went and bought a android pad to company and making couple apps i use when i do measuring. man they have really made it simple nowdays to make apps
 Wontonimo: yeah, a coworker gave a presentation about how awesome it was, that it was her new fav programming lang.  Then 3 weeks later she gave her resignation and took a job doing ... you guessed it
 jacek: adult stuff?
 Wontonimo: lol
 jacek: did i guess
 tpat90: making apps is no adult stuff nowadays
 Wontonimo: if by "adult stuff" you mean coding kotlin for a major accounting firm, then yes
 nulte: close enough
 jacek: now lets make kotlinscript
 struct: maybe next time Ill try kotlin to make a cg game

 nesnes112: hi
 nesnes112: here is a small javascript script
 nesnes112: const S = readline();print(S.replace(/(\d+)(\D+)(?=\d|$)/g,(a,b,c)=&gt;c.repeat(b)))
 nulte: no
 nulte: a represents what the regex matched
 nulte: if you do (a,b,c) =&gt; console.error(a,b,c);
 nulte: you can see exactly what each one does
 nulte: I think b is index of the match?
 nulte: ah no
 nulte: im wrong
 nulte: a = (\d+), b = (\D+), c = (?=\d|$)
 nulte: I think
 nulte: ok I have no idea about it, maybe some js expert can explain better
 nesnes112: thanks nulte but i don't think it's correct what u said
 nulte: I think the a is the entire match of the regex
 nulte: That one im certain about
 nesnes112: thank you nulte
 ninjadip: why you don't you test it in a regex editor
 nesnes112: i did ninjadip
 nesnes112: i ask for only a
 nesnes112: what represents
 ninjadip: a will match to all numbers/digits
 ninjadip: or something that starts witha digit at least
 Wontonimo: i'm just chomping on the bit to use the lmgtfy function hehe

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: what if im trying to make a game that uses 3D and 2D things, what can i use/do to save space and time
 Wontonimo: practice more.  Seriously eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers , i've asked you to focus on codingame related topics here
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i am
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: well more or loss
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: but the codingames guidebook doesnt talk about adding 2D and 3D
 nulte: 3d for what?
 nulte: sdk?
 ninjadip: i never got a guidebook, man what did i pay those membership fees for to Wontonimo then?
 Wontonimo: nulte , eve hasn't even solved 1 puzzle nor knows any languages
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: as far as you know
 Wontonimo: making a game isn't the right next step
 Wontonimo: you just asked me what language you should learn, and you got 1% on the language you tried to test on.
 ninjadip: hm.. that's a tough first step
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: for me aleast
 ninjadip: for anyone!!
 ninjadip: you can't run before you crawl
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: and you cant crawl before you were born
 ninjadip: oh my
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: or start, that would be better thing to say
 nulte: well same applies to coding
 nulte: go learn how to code then you can think about 2d/3d stuff
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: okay,  i'll go and learn stuff
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: what is reverse mode?
 5DN1L: you have to guess what you have to output based on the provided test cases
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: ohhh
 Quidome: anyone experience with Clobber?
 Quidome: strange game&#160;:)
 struct: nim game
 Quidome: yes, can't think of a strategy except for building an endgame database
 jacek: that tutorial game?
 jacek: i cant think of any stategy either
 jacek: thats what i have computers for
 struct:&#160;:/
 Quidome: brute forcing then
 struct: my bot is just my bt code
 jacek: or random mctsing
 struct: with move gen changed
 Quidome: really does mcts work with this game?
 struct: not that good
 Wontonimo: if only there was some way to auto generate a reasonable heuristic 
 jacek: yes if you dont know any eval
 struct: my bot has no eval
 struct: due to that reason
 Quidome: yes, i came to that conclusion as well&#160;:) glad you brought that up
 Quidome: all is done in endgame
 Quidome: hm
 Quidome: did anyone build an endgame database for Clobber?
 struct: I dont think its usefull
 struct: just like on bt
 struct: game is decided early
 Quidome: why is the game decided early?
 jacek: probably you can remove the unusable pawns from consideration
 struct: maybe im wrong about clobber
 Quidome: what is bt?
 struct: breakthrough
 struct: another board game
 Quidome: here on CG?
 struct: I dont know clobber very well though I only spent a few minutes on it
 struct: yes
 Quidome: you are at place 8 with no eval and brute forcing?
 struct: yeap
 Quidome: nice&#160;:)
 Quidome: how deep do you look (max)
 struct: no idea tbh
 struct: I have around 1.6M rollouts on first turn
 Quidome: hm, speed is of the essence then
 jacek: well there is some earlier endgame detection in bt
 struct: 1.6M on clobber
 struct: im also 8th on clobber
 struct: I might be confusing
 Ron1331: who wanna visit north korea with me?
 struct: are we talking about bt or clobber now?
 struct: On bt I do have an eval
 Ron1331: :hugging:
 jacek: oO
 5DN1L: wrong channel, Ron1331?
 struct: Speed is not very usefull, my c4 is the proof of that
 Quidome: I am confused now, is this about Cobbler?
 struct: The numbers I said were about clobber
 Quidome: ok thnxs, what is c4
 struct: connect 4
 Quidome: 1.6M rollouts sounds like a lot
 struct: well first turn is 1 sec
 Quidome: but does that help, probably not, 1.6M at the end would be better&#160;:)
 Quidome: well thnxs for the feedback 
 jacek: speed is quite important. but after some point there are diminishing returns
 jacek: at first having 20-30% more rollouts will be significant, but later having 2x speed would be hardly noticeable
 Quidome: @jacek you are at position one. are you doing brute force and minimal eval as well?
 jacek: im using... NN
 Quidome: Aha, that's different, intersting
 jacek: so a little brute force and maximal eval
 Quidome: gona look at your games see of it shows me some features of winning positions 
 jacek: so manually training yourself by watching the games
 kovi: transfer learning
 struct: MIght be easier to write a NN than to learn from one
 ninjadip: i would think so
 Quidome: I am just curious, if i had to play this game myself I don't have a clue what to do
 struct: I get what you mean Quidome
 jacek: find some papers about it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf">https://project.dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/games/files/msc/Claessen_thesis.pdf</a>
 jacek: or learn some nim game theory
 Quidome: yeah already looked at that one and it doesn't translate to nim apparently
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://meep.cubing.net/portfolio/proj_sw_clobber.htm">https://meep.cubing.net/portfolio/proj_sw_clobber.htm</a>
 jacek: this one uses 'endgames' as it gets scores from separate subgames reducing the search space
 Quidome: Claessen is usong an endgame database so I was wandering if that was already tried here
 jacek: milklla is/was using theoretical approach. i bet msmits used some endgames stuff as well
 Quidome: OK, i have sort of an idea what you guys are doing with this game. I guess there is still room dor some improvement,... hopefully&#160;:)
 jacek: im suprised im still 1st
 Quidome: How long are you at that position?
 jacek: last submit was 30.04.2021
 jacek: sometimes i was 2nd or 3d since then due to resubmiting of others
 Quidome: hm, sort of dead alley. You are more than 2 points better then number 2
 Quidome: that's a nice difference
 jacek: still it isnt perfect. when you see my lost game, youll see that my bot says something like 0.7 or 0.9.. score just to prove a loss one move later
 nulte: that still happens?
 jacek: yes, thats why im surprised it still good
 struct: jacek do you use TTs with mcts?
 jacek: no
 jacek: too messy
 BadBurger: dam, missed eulers mini contest
 struct: you still have 4 days?
 BadBurger: oh, i tought it ended today, and next 4 days is just to vote
 struct: ah
 jacek: eulers mini contest?
 jacek: oh minesweeper?
 BadBurger: yah that
 jacek: its not much different than from old puzzle of the week
 Deathbot1094: It's been a while since I've been on this website and into coding, but can someone help me on hot to write the coding&gt;
 Idk.-_-: hey guys
 Idk.-_-: wich language is best after the python&#160;?
 struct: java
 sulan_codin: assembly
 sulan_codin: fortran
 Idk.-_-: Does Java affect Python development?
 sulan_codin: joking around, you should learn at least one static typed language like Java, C++, C#...
 Quidome: rust
 jacek: :scream:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: people do know TSP is a very well known problem almost everyone has solved at one point or another, right?
 struct: I never did it
 Quidome: well is exposed to it, yes
 DomiKo: As you can see there <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/travelling-salesman/discuss">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/travelling-salesman/discuss</a>
 DomiKo: yes
 Idk.-_-: and i'm very bad at solving math problem what can i do&#160;?&#160;:((
 struct: get better at math
 jacek: try meth, its almost the same
 Idk.-_-: i'm scare if i go after other languages i will forget the python  :D
 jacek: you can never forget python
 jacek: thats what she said
 DomiKo: :joy:
 SleepyPig: q&#160;:
 Blabbage: Idk, don't be afraid to try another language. Java and C# are somewhat easy to get started with, however going from Python, you will probably hate them for their wordy and very explicit nature. But going from doing one language to multiple will enable you to generalize many programming concepts and make it easier to transition and understand new additions to the languanges
 struct: I think going from python to c++ might be enjoyable
 Idk.-_-: damn it man but you said java :D
 Idk.-_-: i started looking java tutorials
 struct: any language will do
 babun: finally rank 1 in bronze&#160;!
 babun: i love this game
 struct: grats
 Blabbage: congrats, which game?
 babun: Mad Pod Racing
 babun: im new, i thought it was Mad Pod Racing game chat only&#160;:)
 Blabbage: This is global chat
 babun: ok&#160;:) have fun everyone&#160;!
 Idk.-_-: struct mate do you know a nice course for c++&#160;? 
 struct: Its been a long time since I learned c++
 struct: maybe? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.learncpp.com/">https://www.learncpp.com/</a>
 Idk.-_-: it's esay to understand&#160;?
 struct: thats subjective
 Idk.-_-: thanks a lot for helping&#160;:))
 Idk.-_-: 1 last question :D
 jacek: mad pod racing eh
 Idk.-_-: do i need to learn c before c++&#160;?
 jacek: no
 jacek: better if you dont know c before :v
 BadBurger: personally, i dont think one should start learning c or c++ unless they have a good reason for using it. i feel like languages are divided into 3 groups, assembly, c/c++, and then there is the rest.
 BadBurger: i mean, hell of a language to know, but learning another language, it will be easyer to learn the next one, you learn programming, you know what you want to do and how, then when you move to another language, its a day or 2 and you start getting the hang of it. (exept java, f java
 jacek: oO
 BadBurger: i want to know c/c++ but its just so hard for me to allocate the energy to get it. when it takes like days to move from one language to another.
 jacek: yeah, there is some allocation in c/c++ :v
 BadBurger: maybe its just me, but knowing languages like kotlin, python, js will take you far if you are a tinkerer/hobbyist.but if c if for future jobs, thats a different story, or if its for competing in the challenges, then c/c++ is great
 Scarfield: nulte has returned :o
 jacek: he has some class at least
 BadBurger: 3 languages that is easy to learn, with those, you get far, python for raspberryPi (big librarys for stepper motors and such) kotlin for android integration. but this is very hard todo with c/c++ in same timeframe it would take to learn python and kotlin for example.
 BadBurger: this is my opinion and not meant as a fact.
 jacek: well c/c++ is quite low level in comparison to those
 BadBurger: yeah and thats my point. you can make a raspberryPi/arduino controlled thing like lights in your home, and control with with a app you made in c (its possible right?) on your phone. but you need to be a dam guru, but do that with python and kotlin, you could learn how to do that in couple weeks 
 Idk.-_-: i can't explain what i mean
 Idk.-_-: i want to learn other languages to improve my python languages and get better understand in syntax
 Idk.-_-: and i don't know wich one of them is best after python
 BadBurger: idk.-_- we understood your question, im just offrails philosophizing, if you want to learn c++, not learning c first might be better.
 jacek: then java or c# will be better. youll learn about static types and they are high level enough
 BadBurger: dont listen to jacek, he is one of those rare people that just know stuff. not like you and me. but yeah, agree, i would go c rather than c++, but definetly go kotlin instead of java
 BadBurger: java is soon a dead language
 jacek: oO
 Idk.-_-: again thank's for helping
 BadBurger: i went form python to javascript because they are so similiar, you just google "python dict in javascript" and you get the js version. and kotlin was very easy to goto after that. i learned js for fun because it was so easy to go to.
 Idk.-_-: kotlin is just for android&#160;?
 BadBurger: and kotlin is very fast, since its compiles, but js is much faster than python, if you want a language you can understand fast after python and want a edge for competition here, since python is slow to sim in theese challenges
 jacek: kotlin is not only for android
 jacek: i learned kotlin after java, for me it's just java on steroids.
 BadBurger: kotlin is the new java, google pushes kotlin more and more and is abandoning java. so its a good time to know kotlin. 
 Elena.: data class already makes it incredible compared to java
 Elena.: saves so much time
 Anschluss: hi everyone
 Elena.: hi
 Anschluss: i was looking to your chat about languages
 Anschluss: what you said about kotlin, is it a point of view or the real future of coding languages?
 Anschluss: cause i got a friend who learn java at this time for is new career may i tell him to change his studies?
 BadBurger: hi
 Elena.: No programming language is 'the future'. When you look for jobs online you'll be able to find them in many kinds of programming languages.
 BadBurger: well, best for him would be to learn both languages, if he knows java, will be quite easy to learn kotlin
 Anschluss: ok thx for answers
 Elena.: As @BadBurger said. If you know Java, switching to/learning another programming language should be no problem.
 Anschluss: talking about me, i'm learning python for fun, is it easy too to switch to kotlin?
 BadBurger: but if he is gonna go into android programming, kotlin will probably be smarter choice, since google pushes kotlin hard. but java will be used for alot of other stuff, but google does have a big impact on kotlin vs java.
 Anschluss: and last question is it easy to find some little freelance job in python programming?
 Anschluss: ok ty @Badburger
 BadBurger: i dont know the answer for that, but i feel like python is more a language that is used personally, or for small projects. sure it can be used for big projects, but because of that, if you intend to learn a language to freelance, python might not be it. but its a great language to know.
 dmuraco: learn javascript to freelance :100:
 BadBurger: yeah my neightbor learned js 2 years ago, ( he is 50years something) he got a job easy programming js. talked to him today about it. so dmuraco might have a good point
 Anschluss: ok cause i'm a math teacher and i'm looking for a little extra cash^^
 BadBurger: shouldnt you freelance in mathlab then?
 Anschluss: is there a big step between python and js?
 BadBurger: matlab i meant
 Anschluss: you think so @badburger?
 Idk.-_-: what about after python first js,java,kotlin&#160;?
 BadBurger: js is probably mosy easy language to goto from python.
 Anschluss: ok
 Idk.-_-:&#160;?
 BadBurger: Anschluss matlab is very popular in scientific circles, and if you are a math teacher, (i dont know matlab or the usage that much, but i know if you aint good in math, then matlab aint for you) and as a match teacher, looking for freelance, mightaswell use your strengths, but math is so important in any programming language. 
 BadBurger: idk.-_- depends what you want to do. if your only goal is to learn another language after python, js will be quite easy, only a day or 2 and you are doing it as good as python
 BadBurger: but theese are my opinions, dont mistake them for facts. everyone is biased.
 KellenW: .
 Idk.-_-: i want to improve my skills in programming and be the best in this field and than get a nice job
 Idk.-_-: but i'm still confused
 NFTOwner: guess who
 NFTOwner: 's back
 ashwin_h26: hello
 Derek_DSouza: hey could remove that profile picture because you do not own it
 dmuraco: LoL
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: guys, don't get banned there are no more renews
 BadBurger: idk.-_- yeah. the thing is. you want to be as good as you possible can, but if you aim to be the best in the field. you are gonna give up too easy. there are people hardwired to think in machine code. many of em dont even seem to think like humans anymore :joy:  you will just need to accept the fact that you wont be best in the field in programming.
 Idk.-_-: why&#160;?
 Idk.-_-: look this 5DN1L he is a legend in his field
 5DN1L: don't look at me. programming isn't even my job lol
 Idk.-_-: mate you sure&#160;? :D
 Idk.-_-: you know every language
 5DN1L: i SOLVE some puzzles in every language
 5DN1L: not that i know them all very well
 BadBurger: because its like.. lets say you are in a wheelchair, and your goal in life is to beat usain bolt in 100m dash.. sure you might get to be a very good programmer, if you have the passion for it. its like saying i want to be the best mathematician in the world, imma start learning addition tomorrow, what would you tell me withou tlying to me?
 Idk.-_-: Certification 99%&#160;? :F
 5DN1L: all just basics tests
 Idk.-_-: 468 puzzle only with python&#160;?
 5DN1L: don't look at me. listen to BadBurger instead
 Idk.-_-: badburger is hopeless
 5DN1L: huh?
 Idk.-_-: mate accept that you are a legend :D
 5DN1L: that's not a respectful thing to say
 5DN1L: please don't do that in this chatroom

 Anschluss: @5DN1L are you really just someone who make fun with programming?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Idk.-_- try #fr, you can call people beef nose there
 Anschluss: with such results?
 5DN1L: i did some programming at work, but it's not required
 Anschluss: ok
 Idk.-_-: sorry sir&#160;!
 Idk.-_-: Be humble and supportive of each other
 Anschluss: just like said badburger some people are usain bolt and some are in a wheel chair
 Anschluss: i'm going to turn my wheels^^
 Idk.-_-: BadBurgersorry mate I did'nt mean badly
 BadBurger: no worries idk.-_- i know you didnt mean to be mean, my views just didnt alignt with your hopes.
 Elena.: Not just CodinGame really. Most companies usually just let you do a test. Usually with algorithmic solutions. 
 5DN1L: interesting, i wonder how that article comes to that conclusion
 Elena.: ^
 Idk.-_-: sorry again&#160;:(
 Blabbage: I would like to read that article as it is very different from my experience
 5DN1L: yeah, if there's a link to that, please share it here
 BadBurger: i will look if i find it, i had the article on my mobile news, but il try finidng it.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I thought Finland was flooded with ex-Nokia guys who take all the jobs
 Derek_DSouza: hey
 ashwin_h26: hi guys!

 NFTOwner: who?
 nulte: just google "codingame" cv
 NFTOwner: asked
 ashwin_h26: thats a pretty based article
 5DN1L: you'll be banned, NFTOwner
 Blabbage: I know many companies that does not have college degree as a mandatory, however the companies I know prefer candidates with a degree
 Derek_DSouza: hey
 Blabbage: If you already have a proven track record, e.g. doing freelance work, projects etc. they are mostly open
 antiwonto: [automated] Derek_DSouza please don't repeat yourself
 Derek_DSouza: who?
 Derek_DSouza: why
 ashwin_h26: hi derek

 BadBurger: im trying to find it on google, but i cant remember wich language i read it on or wich "news" site it was publushed on. so im having difficoulties finding it
 Blabbage: ah, no problem, would just be interesting to read how they got their data
 Elena.: I mean, Amazon, Facebook, Google and large companies in general usually just let you do tests instead of completely going by diplomas/certificates.
 Blabbage: They test everyone in my experience
 Elena.: At a couple of companies I applied to I wasn't able to upload any of my diplomas or certificates. So then it's just my resume and the tests I do lol
 Blabbage: I think a degree is the shortest and easiest path still for most people, for a few, something like learning by doing might be better
 Blabbage: Elana: Nice
 5DN1L: name misspelled
 Blabbage: The companies i speak with have major recruitment problems atm. so they interview everyone
 Elena.: I learned more here than from study. Although I do think having a diploma is useful.
 Blabbage: sry, about the name
 Elena.: np
 I.T.: hello
 Blabbage: Elena, I learned a lot out of uni. however I also learned stuff I would never learn by myself 
 Blabbage: In general I think people should just focus on how to get better at what they would like to work with, and not focus too much on degrees and grades
 BadBurger: yeah the programming hiring world has changed in the last 10years. you cant learn passion for programming. in my books, passion to solve problems by coding is probably most important thing one can have when it comes to programming, thats my opinion. also its fairly easy to teach coding ethics (is that the word for it? im thinking of using spaces between a+=1 and a += 1 for example, the rules for formatting) 
 Be-Ugeen: small question: what is the binary value for '%' 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: lmgtfy what is the binary value for '%'

 Anschluss: are all of these puzzles and clashes near to the problems a programmer could be faced to?
 struct: nope
 Anschluss: ok and what is the length of the gap?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: real programming is debugging somebody else's code
 Anschluss: ok so you need to know your language near to perfect, is it what you mean?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: 10 million lines of embedded code and something that always worked broke on some release and you have to fix it
 Blabbage: and it costs the campany 1000s of dollars an hour until it's fixed
 Anschluss: ok it looks less fun than all the puzzles and clashes proposed^^
 Anschluss: i ask that cause i got so much fun to solve the puzzle and clashes and will be so happy to got a job where i ave that to do all day long
 Anschluss: but looks like a sweet dream^^
 Anschluss: have*
 Blabbage: Working as a programmer doesn't have built in gamification, you have to learn to motivate in other ways 
 Blabbage: Here you do the puzzles for fun, in a company your goal is to make money for the company
 BadBurger: in programming, like kotlin, when you make a class, or function, you use the () for assign variables inside the class or function, like fun a(letter:Int), in that context, what is the brackets called?
 BadBurger: well, letter:Int dont make sense but you understand what i meant i assume
 BadBurger: nevermind, its scope. 
 Idk.-_-: this PUZZLES so confusing
 Idk.-_-: i got headache :D
 ASM_MOV_INT: which puzzle?
 Idk.-_-: Shadows of the Knight
 Idk.-_-: the most esaiest one and i can't do it&#160;:(
 ASM_MOV_INT: classic puzzle - very hard?
 BadBurger: you can ask for help on the puzzles, but not for solutions
 BadBurger: idk.-_- wich part of it is it you strugle with?
 Idk.-_-: its only need to write if up go up or need to make condition for w and h&#160;?
 BadBurger: what anguage are you doing it in?
 Idk.-_-: python 
 BadBurger: lets use 01 map for this.w, h = [int(i) for i in input().split()]that line, sets w to 4 and h to 8.because first map has 8 storys on the house, and 4 windows wide
 BadBurger: x0, y0 = [int(i) for i in input().split()]this set x0 to column2, and y0 is 3
 BadBurger: indexes allways start on 0, so batman starts on third window from the left, wich is window#2
 BadBurger: because indexing starts counting with 0, so 0,1,2,3.
 BadBurger: then every game loop, bomb_dir = input() this fetches and sets bomb_dir to a string, in this case, it will be DR
 BadBurger: from this, you can extrapolate, that bomb y cannot be less than batmanY, because bomb is in direction down and right.
 BadBurger: x=0 y=0 is top left of building, so if you do print("0 0") batman will goto top left window.
 BadBurger: and now answer me, what can bomb X not be?
 Idk.-_-: wait still reading
 Idk.-_-: i will use for example x0 += 4 or indexing&#160;?
 BadBurger: well, before you implement the code, you should be able to think out the next step.from beginning, next step would be to either think of a solution to figure out, what windows the bomb cannot be in, OR, what windows the bomb can be in.
 Idk.-_-: and how do i find this&#160;?
 BadBurger: if you manage to think of a way, to get x, y coordinates of windows, where the bomb can possibly be in, then you can jump to a window, and start over again, this time, the possible windows will be smaller, until eventually you land on the bomb.
 Idk.-_-: first one esay to see but last one is so confusing
 BadBurger: well, just focus on the first level, okay so, tell me what x, y coordinate batman starts on
 BadBurger: or row,col if you prefer that.
 BadBurger: remember, xy starts from top right, wich is 0,0
 Idk.-_-: batman in first map in y 3 becuase stars from 0
 BadBurger: y is correct, and x is?
 Idk.-_-: and x is i think 3
 Idk.-_-: becuase it's start from 0 otherwise it will be 4
 BadBurger: x is 2, because first window is 0, second one is 1, thisrd is 2
 Idk.-_-: oh my bad :D
 BadBurger: if you write print(x0, y0, file=sys.stderr, flush=True) it will display with red text the current location of batman
 BadBurger: debug print is a big asset, if you write print(bomb_dir, file=sys.stderr, flush=True) you will get with red text, the direction of bomb
 BadBurger: but we know bomb is on x:3 y:7
 BadBurger: if batman is on x:2 y:3, and direction of bomb is down right, so we can conclude, that the bomb must be in a window, wich x is greater than batmans, and y is greater than batmans y 
 BadBurger: your job is to figure out a way, to write a code that gives you all windows that x is greater than batmanX, but also, in same condition, window y that is greater than batman y
 BadBurger: since its late and not many here, and its a easy one, i will give little more info than probably allowed
 BadBurger: if you setup minX, minY, maxX, maxY variables
 BadBurger: minX = 0minY = 0maxX = wmaxY = h
 Idk.-_-: k and what information im gonna store in it&#160;?
 Idk.-_-: oh nice :D
 BadBurger: w if you remember is the total windows on width, and h is total windows vertically
 BadBurger: if dir="DR" then you can put minX=batmanXminY=BatmanY
 BadBurger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/125a3fa7-d905-43bc-bbf6-0cd9e921c9fd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/125a3fa7-d905-43bc-bbf6-0cd9e921c9fd</a>
 BadBurger: i suggest googleing python dict
 Idk.-_-: mate what is batmanX variable&#160;?
 Idk.-_-: i have to create it my own&#160;?
 BadBurger: well yeah, you want to track where batman is after your first move, the game only gives you directions, and does not update x0 or y0
 Idk.-_-: so i have to use batmanx += for example 3
 BadBurger: but when you jump for example to print("3 6") you can set your x0 = 3 y0 = 6
 BadBurger: or you can set a new var in start, batmanx=x0
 BadBurger: or just rename x0 to batmanX.
 Idk.-_-: yes that's one is good
 struct: is this binary search?
 BadBurger: this contains binay search yes, but we are currently on, current coordinates of batman, and not in the search part yet.
 struct: ah sry

 Rebollo: Guys each puzzle has it own "timeout" or this limit changes depending on the data volume, complexity, etc?
 struct: Rebollo I think it depends on the puzzle
 Rebollo: thanks
 struct: If you want to measure just run an infinite timer and print the time every 100ms
 Rebollo: I do it right now
 Rebollo: thanks
 Rebollo: let you know the result soon
 struct: it also depends on the language I think
 struct: at least for some puzzles some languages have a bit more time
 Rebollo: of course it is not trivial to deal with time is c++
 Rebollo: as I tought
 Rebollo: :nerd:
 struct: #include &lt;chrono&gt;

 dmuraco: rust &gt;
 struct: Rebollo try that
 Rebollo: worked thanks
 Rebollo: lol
 dmuraco: hey struct whats your favorite struct
 Rebollo: was struggling again
 Rebollo: anything is a challenge to me
 Rebollo: even simple time functions
 Rebollo: :expressionless:
 Hean2000: you are not alone :sweat_smile:
 Rebollo: struct?
 struct: yes?
 Rebollo: what Am i supposed to to with that
 Rebollo: insert in a loop?
 Rebollo: I got this as result
 Rebollo: 153470
 Rebollo: what does it mean?
 struct: well that gives the multiple time
 struct: nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds
 Rebollo: All right so I added the cerr (milisencds) inside a while(true) loop, the last result was 596
 Rebollo: does it mean the timeout is half a second?
 Rebollo: last result before *timeout
 C26_1: Good Morning
 C26_1: Hello Everyone

 struct: hi
 struct: that will print count evey 100milliseconds
 C26_1: ah I understand the code
 C26_1: print the number increasingly for every 100ms 
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ceabfe88-ba27-4a6a-937b-28d8142bb9c6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ceabfe88-ba27-4a6a-937b-28d8142bb9c6</a>
 struct: yes
 Rebollo: but there is something wrong here
 Rebollo: the result is:

 Rebollo: meaning the time is half a second?
 Rebollo: last printed number is 5
 Rebollo: so 500 milisencods
 C26_1: hmmmmm
 C26_1: I think the clock may get a problem
 Rebollo: we are talking that the timeout is half a second?
 C26_1: You see when the compiler evaluate the conditions, it needs time
 C26_1: and so does the assign and increasing the count var and print something out
 C26_1: So I think it's the compiler error
 C26_1: Hey Struct
 Rebollo: but you can check for example how long takes before and after this operation to check if your argumemnt is true
 struct: yes?
 C26_1: why does the code has "start" var when it hasn't assign yet?
 Rebollo: give us a light about we mentioned
 C26_1: Doesn't that give you an error or something?
 Rebollo: just initialize it before the while
 C26_1: Ok
 nulte: just do auto start
 dmuraco: facts
 Rebollo: what are they?
 Rebollo: I am waiting for the facts
 Rebollo: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 struct: you still need help Rebollo?
 struct: srry

 struct: mean that it did 500ms at least
 struct: before it timed out
 Rebollo: only half a second?
 struct: so you should have around that time for the puzzle
 struct: yeah
 struct: half a second is a lot
 Rebollo: humm
 Rebollo: I see
 struct: Do you know the game connect 4?
 Rebollo: no
 struct: quatro em linha
 Rebollo: hum I check and know now

 struct: the bot I have plays 3 million games in 1 second
 struct: just so you have an idea how fast c++ is
 Rebollo: wow
 Rebollo: min max right?
 struct: no
 struct: monte carlo tree search
 Rebollo: would you mind sharing the code?
 Rebollo: curiosity only to have a look
 Rebollo: but 3 million games in 1 second sound impossible
 struct: sry but I cant share it.
 Rebollo: let me do a quick check
 Rebollo: if I do
 struct: I do a lot of stuff like avx
 Rebollo: a simple while
 Rebollo: only counting
 lexicons: simd?
 struct: yes lexicons
 lexicons: inline asm or intrinsics
 struct: intrinsics
 Rebollo: Do you parallelize in some way?
 lexicons: sick
 struct: no you can only use 1 thread as far as im aware
 lexicons: what kind of sandbox is the code run in
 struct: for example this is my win check condition

 lexicons: nice
 struct: haswell cpu it ranges from 2.1ghz to 3.1ghz
 struct: you have 768 MB of ram
 lexicons: oh wow
 lexicons: is it hosted
 Rebollo: What is the trick? Data type? Data structure?
 Rebollo: Type of operations?
 lexicons: and do you know the compiler flags
 struct: aws I think
 struct: Yeah I use them
 lexicons: what are they
 struct: These are the ones I use
 struct: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 lexicons: like that the backend compiles your source with
 struct: ah no
 struct: you need to put them at the top
 lexicons: oh pragmas
 struct: yeah
 struct: it needs to be pragmas&#160;:/
 struct: But its still very fast
 struct: I think default here is O2...
 struct: But rust and C# do have release mode
 lexicons: wonder if you could locally compile it with your own optimizations then objdump or something and get inline asm to throw in main()
 struct: Rebollo Avx can be a bit tricky
 lexicons: obviously with lots of messing with the strings

 struct: ah I think this is just a compressor?
 struct: But I think you can do some stuff lexicons
 Rebollo: I dont know even what it is
 lexicons: oh it just makes a new file
 Rebollo: but will lear about it for sure
 struct: You can submit py3 bot run c++ from it
 lexicons: is the code run in linux
 struct: yes
 struct: Rebollo you dont have to worry too much about avx
 lexicons: i was poking around a little earlier in the bash dropdown to see whats up

 struct: if you check here
 struct: both rank 1 and rank 4 use a c++ bot
 struct: but is listed as python 
 struct: because they did submit python code
 lexicons: oh im working on my bot for that rn
 struct: Nice
 struct: top 4 is NNs btw
 lexicons: i just started it and im in wood 1
 lexicons: what are the other rules like
 lexicons: that they add as you go
 ionKOT: uh
 struct: at bronze or silver you get shield
 struct: at gold you get 2 pods
 lexicons: im thinking message passing
 struct: and at legend the max thrust is 200
 lexicons: oh huh
 lexicons: whats shield for do they fight
 struct: they increase your mass by 10
 struct: ok your mass becomes 10
 lexicons: what kind of interaction is there between opponents
 struct: check top bots replays
 lexicons: oh thanks
 struct: basicly you have 1 pod racing and another 1 trying to block the opponent
 struct: You can have both pod racing but is not a good strategy
 lexicons: oh interesting
 lexicons: i thought it would just be like motion planning
 lexicons: no combat
 struct: if you wanna race solo you can always try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race</a>
 struct: It uses the same physics
 struct: and the referee is public
 lexicons: oh this is cool
 lexicons: you can just feedforward it perfectly then
 struct: yeah you can write the engine and then simulate 
 lexicons: it would be cool if it was traveling salesman
 lexicons: oh wait it is lol
 lexicons: they arent ordered right
 struct: wdym?
 lexicons: you can visit the checkpoints in any order
 struct: no
 struct: there is an order
 lexicons: oh
 lexicons: the win condition is You visit all checkpoints as given by inputs before the time is out!
 struct: But it could be interesting if you had to find the best path
 lexicons: yeah thats what im thinking
 struct: That part of the statement makes it seem like it yeah
 struct: but it is not&#160;:/
 lexicons: so you have to go 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: for N laps
 lexicons: hm ok
 struct: the multiplayer one is more interesting but also harder
 lexicons: ill try to solve the base case with the car first
 lexicons: and use something based on that for the racing pod
 struct: you can always check this source for sim and search if you want

 BadBurger: in languages like kotlin, whats the guidelines on classes, inside or before main()?
 struct: I would say before

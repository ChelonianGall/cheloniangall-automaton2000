 Brennti: I'm so lost on this one
 Brennti: Is n the array of all the temperatures?
 Uljahn: n is the number of temperatures
 Uljahn: use debug to print inputs to error stream to analyze them
 Brennti: I printed n in the debug thingy, and my output was 5. Does that mean that there are 5 total temperatures.
 Uljahn: for that testcase yes
 Uljahn: each testcase has it's own set of inputs
 Brennti: Okay, thank you very much. That actually helps in this problem solving
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: debug is your best friend
 Automaton2000: i'm looking at your code
 derjack: :flushed:
 Uljahn: 50% of my code is printing to debug :slight_smile:
 5DN1L: Why is Automaton2000's profile not accessible in chat? And without a profile picture? Is it a different Automaton2000? :open_mouth:
 Automaton2000: how can i get the rules
 Green_Man: Google it 
 Green_Man: Googlr 
 arckoss77: hello mates
 Uljahn: perhaps the chat is buggy
 Uljahn: Automaton2000 uses external connection via xmpp
 Automaton2000: he knows a lot about the game as well

 Overbed: what is ASCII VALUE
 chenhaorantianjiayi: hello

 chenhaorantianjiayi: :heart::yellow_heart::green_heart::blue_heart::purple_heart:
 chenhaorantianjiayi: :yin_yang:
 BattleSponge_9ce3: ASCII is a way to represent characters like alphabets in numbers. Its mainly used in electronic communication, Range of ASCII is usually 0 - 127 
 chenhaorantianjiayi: :flag_cn:
 therealbeef: that's unicode not ascii&#160;;)
 chenhaorantianjiayi: unicode？
 chenhaorantianjiayi: :flag_fo::flag_dk:
 therealbeef: you can search it
 BattleSponge_9ce3: where can I see the solutions for problems?
 5DN1L: You can't see any solutions until you solve the problem
 BattleSponge_9ce3: Im struck with The Resistance problem and I just want to understand how they did that.
 chenhaorantianjiayi: :droplet:
 chenhaorantianjiayi: :droplet:
 chenhaorantianjiayi: :droplet:
 BattleSponge_9ce3: oh ok then, ill try to solve it:sweat_smile:

 brend0g: you muted me yesterday
 brend0g: rat
 brend0g: struct are you gorny
 brend0g: jhorny
 brend0g: horny
 datu12: dude this is a coding game not tinder lmao
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Tinder? For an elementary school kid? Pretty irresponsible...
 datu12: Who knows, you might be.. but that brend0g might not be
 datu12: You can easily lie on tinder anyway lol
 brend0g: scumming
 brend0g: cumming
 brend0g: everywhreere
 brend0g: help me&#160;:(
 Uljahn: brend0g: you've been warned but still can't watch your language, that means you're going to get banned
 brend0g:&#160;:(
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: He is. At least I hope for him. :smirk:
 brend0g:&#160;:(
 brend0g: :9
 brend0g:&#160;:(
 Uljahn: rip
 eulerscheZahl: one user goes, the other comes.good afternoon
 Thorcode: brend0g have he being banned
 struct: no he was promoted to mod
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Seems realisitc.
 Maximoo62: can i get mod??
 jacek: only div
 Wontonimo: :point_right: "%" here you go Maximoo62
 jacek: ‰ here you go all
 therealbeef: hmm a lot of the multi names were changed. copyright issues?
 [CG]Thibaud: yes, in prevention
 Scarfield: broomstick flyers xD 
 eulerscheZahl: Amazonial
 eulerscheZahl: and the artwork replaced by a screenshot of the game&#160;:(
 Scarfield: Besos wont like that name
 Scarfield: Bezos*
 eulerscheZahl: Jeff
 Scarfield: my name
 eulerscheZahl: when I use the search at the top, it doesn't even show the substitution artwork
 eulerscheZahl: Soul Snatchers
 eulerscheZahl: galleon wars
 eulerscheZahl: squiddy succeeded with a lot of his name suggestions
 GamingGnawer: does anyone know anything about preprocessor functions in c++?I was trying to be sneaky in golf... and it just does nothing...
 Scarfield: they are impressively lazy some of them xD
 eulerscheZahl: there are still some more on the list that will be renamed&#160;:(
 GamingGnawer: #define Q(a,b) toupper(c)=='a'?'b':   char c;std::cout&lt;&lt;( Q(O,0) Q(L,1) c );
 eulerscheZahl: Unary - Code golfthat used to be Chuck Norris
 Scarfield: i hope there will be a Netflix show called Spring Challenge soon, could make the contest names more interesting again
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: oh, the forums working again
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: There's a forum?! :o
 GamingGnawer: I figured it out... doing cast of x to char with 'x' just isn't a thing
 Wontonimo: you *chewed* through that problem
 GamingGnawer: When using an external IDE, how do you manage multiple files?
 GamingGnawer: It seems the coding-game  add on syncs one file?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Yup
 jacek: ee
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: You can't use multiple files on cg, so obviously you only can sync a single file.
 GamingGnawer: so do I a manual "Include" by ctrl+c before upload... or is there a way to automate
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Of course you can automate it. What language do you use?
 GamingGnawer: c++
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: So you can try mine <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGppMerger">https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGppMerger</a>
 GamingGnawer: neat! Thanks!
 Wontonimo: in unix land you can do
 Wontonimo: cat file1.cpp file2.cpp &gt; outfile.cpp
 Wontonimo: done
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Yeah! This way you'll get includes or pragma in the middle of the final file!
 Wontonimo: you sir are correct
 qwpjhofwealn89yae: e
 GamingGnawer: When writing all code in one file, expectations on beuty and optimization goes down :P
 qwpjhofwealn89yae: what?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Right. But there's a chars limit on cg, so you don't want duplicate and useless lines.
 GamingGnawer: true!
 Wontonimo: echo `cat file1.cpp` "\n"`grep -v include file2.cpp` &gt; outfile.cpp
 Wontonimo: or use your script
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: :smirk:
 Westicles: somebody should approve the snooker puzzle so we have something to do today
 jacek: why dont you
 Husoski: Who renamed the "Blender" puzzles to "Blunder"?
 Westicles: I took all the time to solve Wine Kalbadia 2 and the guy just let it expire and die
 Wontonimo: Husoski - all puzzles with a possible copyright or tm  are being renamed
 struct: rip all my ports
 Husoski: Oh, I guess that make sense.   Thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: rip your port 8080?
 eulerscheZahl: now there's a "Bender - Episode 4" but no 1-3&#160;:(
 Scarfield: rename to flexo
 pihack: hey flutter is better or ract native?
 jacek: fluttershy?
 eulerscheZahl: and they completely removed the artwork without any replacement
 Scarfield: thought they wouldnt change the user contributed ones&#160;:(
 jacek: next theyll remove copyrighted avatars
 eulerscheZahl: Bender1-3 were official ones
 Scarfield: oh yea thats right
 Wontonimo: personally, I think there is an opportunity lost here.  Who wouldn't want more buzz about their brand so long as there are links back to the copyright portal
 jacek: they already remove Automaton2000 's avatar
 Automaton2000: how did you do the same thing.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.artstation.com/tontonrevolver">https://www.artstation.com/tontonrevolver</a>I don't find it on Tonton's profile. didn't he upload it?
 eulerscheZahl: also where did Automaton's profile pic go?
 jacek: copyright police is strong <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://c.tenor.com/UZvVVLVZ0sEAAAAC/the-simpsons-movie-piracy.gif">https://c.tenor.com/UZvVVLVZ0sEAAAAC/the-simpsons-movie-piracy.gif</a>
 Scarfield: its all on the profile
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling that the gif itself is a copyright violation jacek
 jacek: :head_bandage:
 eulerscheZahl: can't find this on the artstation: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=2210494561333">https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=2210494561333</a>
 5DN1L: Either Automaton2000 here is a different one, or its profile pic just won't load in the chat
 Automaton2000: i have absolutely no idea what to do
 5DN1L: The pic can still be seen in its profile <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/b97bb4be55e91775c31501aaabb786a27927211">https://www.codingame.com/profile/b97bb4be55e91775c31501aaabb786a27927211</a>

 jacek: mars lander?
 eulerscheZahl: i just wanted to shock you, CG version of rickroll :D
 eulerscheZahl: did you click?
 jacek: eeyup
 struct: I think user ones are safe
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud stated that they will only change the official onces
 eulerscheZahl: ones
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just not happy by how they do it. looks like minimum effort compared to the original&#160;:(
 jacek: onitama is safe then
 eulerscheZahl: it might be possible to just ask the company and get their approval, if they are reasonable
 eulerscheZahl: it's clear that the game is not an original idea and one user even told me that he bought the board game because of it
 eulerscheZahl: rule of thumb: the bigger the company, the less reasonable
 jacek: apple, google, amazon, facebook, codingame...
 struct: and being american
 Wontonimo: hey Automaton2000 , do you want help with CSB&#160;?
 Automaton2000: what do you think i should be able to use a ga
 Wontonimo: wow, that's a good response from Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: maybe you are the only way to see if it's any better
 Wontonimo: i do specialize in fixing brains like yours Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: need to work on the contest
 Wontonimo: I think Automation just told me off
 Scarfield: are you slowly turning into maddy?
 Wontonimo: no.  just a little after work fun
 Wontonimo: happy friday everyone
 Scarfield: wait when did you get ascended to mod?

 Wontonimo: what i hear anyway
 Scarfield: so now its up to 0$
 Wontonimo: nope, £0
 Wontonimo: gotta get the currency right
 Scarfield: spend them wisely
 jacek: on scientific papers!
 Wontonimo: I have to convert  it to Canadian first, and pay the exchange unfortunately
 Scarfield: anyone seen arcane?
 jacek: when was the last time you lost it?

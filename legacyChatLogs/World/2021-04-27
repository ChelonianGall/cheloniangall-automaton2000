 Smelty: hi world
 ZuhairAbid: hey can I find my last clash of code solutions?
 arubaha: you can look in your notifications for the clashes and click on them, dunno if there's a better way

 Notter: Does anyone have tips for Marslander 2?
 VizGhar: Notter = if else till u die&#160;:) or implement GA/SA
 VizGhar: I took first path and now working on second one
 darkhorse64: You can try GA on ML1. Only one parameter, easy fitness function
 Alex-1: hi VizGhar
 Uljahn: Notter: find the center of a landing zone, approach it maintaining the altitude when it's far (useful for the last testcase), then descend, never let the absolute angle go above 45 degrees
 Alex-1: I am trying to solve Code Vs Zombie but don't get it
 Alex-1: any help
 darkhorse64: I have also used a GA for this one. Write a sim, discretize possible directions, always move 1000 pixels, fitness is the score 
 Alex-1:&#160;?
 Notter: My approach for Code vs. Zombies is very simple but it's somehow enough to complete the objective
 darkhorse64: yeah, I am a bit sketchy. 
 darkhorse64: What goes over your head&#160;?
 Notter: Me?
 darkhorse64: Alex-1
 Alex-1: yeah
 Notter: Oh ok
 Alex-1: bro
 Alex-1: i use if and else condition
 Alex-1: don't get what is the problem or how to do it
 darkhorse64: GA (genetic algorithm) is needed if you want to maximize your score. Does that name ring a bell&#160;? The idea is to compute a set of moves for your player and randomly mutate the moves and see if that increases your score. You kill zombies just by moving close enough to them
 HTierney703: Hello World!
 Notter: Hi
 Alex-1: hi
 HTierney703: :worried:
 Alex-1: i can't understand what to do in CodeVsZombie
 HTierney703: set coordinates to 7000 5000
 HTierney703: that worked for me
 Alex-1: ohh let me try
 Alex-1: few testcase pass
 Alex-1: HTierney703
 RenardFute: Alex-1 you need to kill every zombie before every human have died 
 HTierney703: it worked for me

 Alex-1: okk SImpleNick
 SimpleNick: may be 1 array for height, pod marrine coordinate. we have line height = curve or zig zag, and we input height and current state pod and we matimatics next point for pod and again and again while curve line ______ and find center coordinate this line if find center line ________ we construct vector from pod to line and we have angle and pod next angle&#160;!= -1 next. it route pod why us this ga sa if we have coordinate system

 King_Coda: Ajac... isn't the entire point of learning to program... is to get a job?
 Ajac: honestly, a lot of people just like to make things
 King_Coda: I'm learning c++ c# and javascript so I can become a game developer
 Ajac: I doubt that's the case with those people, but I don't understand how they could end up acting that way in the first place, so idk if me doubting means anything
 Therabidpanther: i cant tell if you are serious King_Coda, but a lot of people code for their own enjoyment

 WannaBeHum1n: does clash of code consider the language u are using&#160;?

 King_Coda: ...are you talking about this website specifically
 WannaBeHum1n: yes
 King_Coda: ohhhhh

 King_Coda: I thought you were just saying in general
 WannaBeHum1n: i am sure i did the minimum
 WannaBeHum1n: yet 
 WannaBeHum1n: 6/8
 WannaBeHum1n: all above are python
 King_Coda: that would be the stupidest and boldest claim to make if you were talking about people in general
 WannaBeHum1n: coda u talking to me&#160;?
 King_Coda: i thought you were saying that all people who learn how to program just to get a job as a programmer are entitled
 King_Coda: But you were just talking about the people on this website who expect to get help and teached by other users are entitled
 King_Coda: sorry WannaBeHum1n, i was talking to Ajac lol

 Justin_Lowry: how does one actually learn on here with little to no experience
 struct: very hard without experience
 Therabidpanther: nearly impossible
 Justin_Lowry: where do u recommend learning lua then
 BlaiseEbuth: nowhere
 SimpleNick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/mqw0oQWB-n8">https://youtu.be/mqw0oQWB-n8</a>
 Justin_Lowry: ...
 Justin_Lowry: so then how do I learn
 ZarthaxX: you cant sadly&#160;:(
 Therabidpanther: i mean, there are definitely youtube videos out there, maybe some sites with resources
 Therabidpanther: i use tutorialpoint for quick learning
 Justin_Lowry: how did people learn lua if u cant learn lua
 BlaiseEbuth: Nobody learn lua
 BlaiseEbuth: nobody know lua
 SimpleNick: practical love twiks -&gt; have fun and exp for skill up -&gt; undersyanding -&gt; achieve
 BlaiseEbuth: lua does not exist
 Justin_Lowry: for a moderator youre not that helpful are you
 Therabidpanther: roasted lol
 ZarthaxX: mod position was free by the time
 ZarthaxX: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: I am. I'm saving you for making a very bad choice
 ZarthaxX: just google lua Justin_Lowry
 ZarthaxX: tutorials etc
 ZarthaxX: haha :rofl:
 Therabidpanther: is lua that bad? lol
 SimpleNick: lua have wow subsystem
 struct: You are better by learning a language with more resources available
 struct: and then learn lua
 SimpleNick: you are start lua in wow
 Therabidpanther: ^^]
 Justin_Lowry: sorry but I cant learn from videos I have to do it myself my learning disability doesnt do well with visual stuff
 Justin_Lowry: I know javascript
 Therabidpanther: have you tried following along a video before?
 Justin_Lowry: yes
 SimpleNick: lua have subsystem in freebsd
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/">https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh... Js... So go forth with lua. You're already lost for me...
 Therabidpanther: React is GOATed
 Justin_Lowry: I know java and kotlin aswell
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Justin_Lowry: I just want to learn lua
 SimpleNick: hm for primmer, you have algorithm in javascript
 SimpleNick: and you love this algorithm
 jacek: astroapprove?
 SimpleNick: replace this algorithm and pattern in lua
 Astrobytes: sure, one sec jacek
 struct: I dont even know 1 language...
 Justin_Lowry: In the words of ash ketchum I gotta learn them all
 jacek: start with FiM++
 struct: o.o, amazons already approved
 jacek: amazing
 struct: I got 1 notification I refresh and its approved...
 Westicles: Just remember these chats when you think about letting the car drive itself
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh! I see. So you start with the badest...
 Justin_Lowry: no i start with the most common
 Justin_Lowry: just like most guys start there sexual lives with the most common
 Justin_Lowry: your mother being the most common
 Therabidpanther: interesting analogy 
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. But lua in the most common&#160;?
 SimpleNick: lua or haskel?:slight_smile:
 Justin_Lowry: lua is more common than others for example roblox which has probably 1 bil + concurent players is lua
 WannaBeHum1n: cobol and lua 
 WannaBeHum1n: ftw
 Therabidpanther: roblox uses lua? lol
 Justin_Lowry: so lua is pretty common
 Justin_Lowry: yes indeed it does its rbxlua
 Therabidpanther: if thats so, im sure roblox has some learning material on it?
 Justin_Lowry: made by kids ye
 Justin_Lowry: and its very odd to understand there stuff
 BlaiseEbuth: Wow 1/7 of the humanity is on roblox... :o
 Therabidpanther: i believe it LOL
 Justin_Lowry: daily its 37 million about
 jacek: how much of humanity is on minecraft
 Therabidpanther: all of humanity 
 BlaiseEbuth: Not me. But I'm not human
 Justin_Lowry: isnt minecraft java?
 Therabidpanther: do aliens also play minecraft?
 Therabidpanther: I believe it is java
 Justin_Lowry: ur right ur not ur a mod but a pretty bad one at that
 Westicles: some microsoft game the kids love
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact I'm really good at using chat commands...
 R3Ked: hey does anyone know how to play the escape game solo
 R3Ked: i want to do it in person, not over zoom
 struct: Create two accounts and invite the other one
 imrel: we used to make fun on people who chatted via app while sitting next to eachother. modern times modern times
 WannaBeHum1n: lol
 Westicles: You took that mother insult much better than most
 BlaiseEbuth: mother insult&#160;?
 R3Ked: wait but isn't there a limited amount of slots left
 struct: I dont know, but is the only way to play it solo

 BlaiseEbuth: I don't undestand it as an insult... For me that was "each guy's mom is its common archetype"
 BlaiseEbuth: *his
 Astrobytes: I don't think it was that deep tbh . . . 
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh... For once I left the benifice of the doubt to somebody...
 Astrobytes: Well, it's not every day one witnesses a miracle :rofl:
 Westicles: These kids, can't even put together a coherent insult.  Sheesh
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway I don't care about insults. But I sanction the act of insulting.
 Westicles: Sanction is a funny word... it can mean you approve or disapprove
 SimpleNick: if me sad i playing in youtube stay crunchy Ronald Jenkees and i fell his motivation)
 SimpleNick: because it fun
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not so fluent in english. ^^ let's say 'punish'
 imrel: pun-ish
 King_Coda: Minecraft java has about 90 million players worldwide
 King_Coda: minecraft bedrock has 110 million players worldwide
 WannaBeHum1n: does that include cracked minecraft&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: not payed for&#160;?
 King_Coda: no
 WannaBeHum1n: i mean
 WannaBeHum1n: wow nice
 Westicles: We aren't fluent either.  When a football player retires, the headline says he 'resigns'.  They put the same headline when he signs a new contract
 King_Coda: oooooh re-signs
 King_Coda: wow i didnt see that until now
 King_Coda: Westicles precense truly is enlightening
 King_Coda: *presence
 Astrobytes: re-sign though
 King_Coda: Astrobytes, what is this joke about westicles troll accounts
 Astrobytes: It goes back some time ago
 Astrobytes: Don't worry about it
 King_Coda: I'm just glad that I got to meet the legend that you hold so highly
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 King_Coda: What, Coding escape only gives you a limited number of invitations? It says I have 20/20 invitations left
 King_Coda: That's a shame
 Therabidpanther: how many people are you inviting lol
 Astrobytes: It's still in a somewhat-closed beta
 imrel: they don't want you to get naughty
 King_Coda: Personally I believe that this is the right step that codingame is taking. People who don't know much code should still be able to enjoy the site
 King_Coda: I hope we see more games like this in the future
 jacek: uh-oh, amazons has no tags?
 Astrobytes: These approvers eh
 BlaiseEbuth: Except that cgescape has nothing to do with this site, you're right.
 struct: I can still edit it
 struct: which tags do you want?
 struct: No books
 BlaiseEbuth: 5%
 Astrobytes: lol, anti-booking - don't. Just in case :D
 BlaiseEbuth: deforestation?
 jacek: the same as othello?
 BlaiseEbuth: mono-boobs-huntress
 struct: Bezos?
 jacek: mcts minimax, bitboarding
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 King_Coda: Jesus, 1 hour to 2 hour long coding escape campaign missions.
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, the time flies
 King_Coda: I mean, I know halo had long campaign missions, but this is just a collaborative point and click
 struct: Oh I should change something
 struct: so random vs random is always a draw
 Astrobytes: No, not always
 Astrobytes: Check your last battles
 King_Coda: I'm gonna be part of the first testing group for the new missions
 struct: I know it isnt, thats why I said I need to change :p
 Astrobytes: Oh, I misread lol, my bad :D
 struct: King_Coda you are testing the next contest?
 King_Coda: No no struct, nothing that exciting
 struct: How do you know its an escape?
 King_Coda: Just the new missions for the Coding Escape game. All 4 of them
 Westicles: I beta tested for the contest.  It is based on the board game S'quarrels
 struct: another card game?
 King_Coda: Yes
 Westicles: Oh whoops, I guess that was a secret.  Disregard

 struct: :cookie:
 BlaiseEbuth: Why not&#160;?
 Tony12C: :grinning:
 Tony12C: Because u don't know the java code to ban me
 BlaiseEbuth: If java was needed to ban someone I'll be so sad...&#160;:(
 SimpleNick: i go to create new class:upside_down:
 Smelty: o . o
 Astrobytes: lol, did a darkhorse64 and made a boss that beats me
 Astrobytes: Admittedly it's almost the same code
 jacek: hm?
 struct: he cant beat his own ai
 darkhorse64: not exactly before I released the boss, I made sure that I had a better version (a faster one) but it was barely enough
 Astrobytes: I didn't write a proper bot, just the boss
 jacek: you could just copy paste that ~
 Astrobytes: It worked fine in testing, in the wild it was less effective :P
 jacek: fyi, what im using now isnt NN
 jacek: good old negamax + eval
 darkhorse64: nor n-tuple&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I don't see a use for n-tuples tbh... or perhaps, possibly, up to near endgame
 jacek: not even n-tuple, yes
 darkhorse64: I have done  a bit of google search and it seems to be a game where heuristics can play a strong part
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Scarfield: amazons?
 jacek: its a kind of that combinatorical theory games?
 jacek: where last to move wins
 Astrobytes: I guess n-tuples could help with forcing queens into chambers
 jacek: or loses if cant move*
 darkhorse64: more like space controlled heuristics
 darkhorse64: space controlling
 Astrobytes: Yes Scarfield
 Astrobytes: And yes darkhorse64, territory control is a huge part of the game
 ddx: this might be a stupid question, but i cant figure out the command to use boost in c#, can anyone help, thanks
 ZarthaxX: just output the string BOOST
 Astrobytes: ^
 ZarthaxX: it doesnt have to do with your language
 Astrobytes: BoostaxX
 ZarthaxX: Boostbytos
 ZarthaxX: :bird:
 ddx: Console.WriteLine(nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointY + "BOOST");
 ZarthaxX: missing the space at the end
 Scarfield: " BOOST"
 ZarthaxX: between the Y and BOOST
 ZarthaxX: Im sorry scarfo but i won this one
 ZarthaxX: (?)
 ddx: oh thank you so much
 ZarthaxX: yw
 Scarfield: my answer was slow and lazy, fair enough you win :moneybag:
 ZarthaxX: i wanted a cookie, not your bag of money&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: run with it!
 ZarthaxX: lol :rofl:
 Scarfield: :first_place:
 Scarfield: its a cookie you can put around your neck ready to be eaten, nomnom
 ZarthaxX: thanks! -&gt; breaks his teeths
 ZarthaxX: tooth*
 Astrobytes: Or teeth
 ZarthaxX: i would break multiple
 Astrobytes: Teeth then
 jacek: tooths
 Astrobytes: tooth is singular, teeth is plural
 jacek: how many points does boss have
 Therabidpanther: 1
 Scarfield: teoth is which ever
 Astrobytes: 12.54 jacek
 jacek: so close eh
 Astrobytes: You're enjoying this eh
 Scarfield: how many points is a jacek?
 jacek: yes
 struct: Okay im updating referee so it uses avx
 bossyboots: HELLO
 jacek: avx in java?
 ZarthaxX: kidding struct???¡ :rofl:
 struct: Java doesnt have it?
 struct: im ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes i read it and wrote the opposite :DD
 ZarthaxX: about the teeth i mean
 ZarthaxX: so bad damn
 ZarthaxX: struct ffs :D

 jacek: oO
 Kitkat260: i need 3 more players plz
 Kitkat260: please
 Kitkat260:&#160;:(
 King_Coda: 2 more players
 jacek: try discord
 davilla: sorry I was just looking to see what "it" was
 davilla: looks like fun but how long will it take?
 Kitkat260: 1 hour
 davilla: hi KitKat
 davilla: I think I'd like to but I have some things to do first
 Kitkat260: ok
 Marchete: I have no idea how to train a damn regression NN
 Marchete: 0.3 losses
 jacek: adjust the weights to decreases the loss [solved]
 jacek: youre doing tensorflow, it should do it for you
 Marchete: wow
 Marchete: it's solved!
 Marchete: thanks
 King_Coda: I fixed the steam pipes
 Marchete: I know it decreases, from 0.9 to 0.3
 Marchete: but 0.3 is a lot of loss still
 Marchete: from -1 to 1 range
 jacek: do you have some conflicting data
 jacek: is it train or validation loss
 VizGhar: Are there many players using NN here?
 VizGhar: It's wonderland for me still&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Quite a few now yeah
 King_Coda: I think i figured out the weird da vinci code thing on the book on the floor
 Astrobytes: King_Coda: make a private room if you want to discuss
 Astrobytes: And send it to your team mates
 Astrobytes: Spoilers and all that
 King_Coda: oh right
 King_Coda: sorry
 Astrobytes: Also, the voice chat is very very useful
 Marchete: train loss
 King_Coda: voice chat won't load for some reason
 Astrobytes: I had to reconnect my mic a few times
 VizGhar: use some other tool for communication
 jacek: Marchete still, does it play better if trained?
 Astrobytes: Zoom worked well the first times around
 jacek: or skype :v
 VizGhar: When working with NN you are using tensorflow with pytom mostly, or some custom implementation?
 jacek: i have my own implementation. my NNs are quite simple
 King_Coda: Neural Networks?
 jacek: eeyup
 King_Coda: I know nothing about those
 Marchete: I'm using TF
 Marchete: but I'm not an example
 Marchete: I don't know what I'm doing
 Marchete: how much time it takes to train, jacek?
 VizGhar: jacek can you recommend some repo or something, where I can take a peak into someone others implementation?
 Marchete: minutes, hours, days?!
 VizGhar: I know theory but not much more
 VizGhar: Marchete - longer - better :D 
 jacek: depends. i can train oware that matches my own from zero within hour
 jacek: breakthrough almost a day, bandas 15 minutes
 darkhorse64: One thing I do not understand about training is how to backpropagate results after a series of moves
 jacek: VizGhar nah, i just found some nn xor example and translated it into c++
 jacek: darkhorse64 i use mcts backpropagation&#160;:?
 VizGhar: yeah. I guess I should just google for 10 minutes :D
 King_Coda: does the Coding Escape video/voice chat window use a zoom extension, or is it an original app made by codingame specifically for this site?
 darkhorse64: backpropagate in a NN 
 jacek: hm?
 Marchete: :S
 jacek: also, my losses at the end are in range 0.01 - 0.1
 jacek: for bandas it could be about 0.09, for bt 0.04
 VizGhar: noice... why not to use it with every single game?
 jacek: i use nn for most board games
 King_Coda: I'm asking because the voice/video chat refuses to load, and zoom doesnt work on my computer, so i thought there might be a connection
 VizGhar: I need 2-3 years to get there :D
 VizGhar: Hope I can get at least to legend on next contest
 Marchete: inputs are [0..1] and expected score is [-1..1] right?
 Astrobytes: It's a Jitsi plugin iirc King_Coda
 jacek: yes, i use tanh
 King_Coda: thanks Astrobytes
 darkhorse64: jacek: in your n-tuple example, you know the exact outcome of a game, so you can compute an error. But, how to adapt for more complex games&#160;?
 darkhorse64: I mean there is no ground truth
 jacek: darkhorse64 the target is score of best root move from mcts or 1/0/-1 if solved
 jacek: i have i.e. fixed 200 iterations of mcts, use that for target, put i.e. 500000 positions into buffer and learn from buffer. then play more with improved network and repeat
 MSmits: 200 seems little
 VizGhar: ++
 darkhorse64: At each ply, you compare target and NN eval  and backpropagate&#160;?
 MSmits: it won't perform worse with more iterations will it? This is just to save time?
 jacek: but it works for me
 jacek: maybe more would be better but takes time
 Marchete: it's a full MCTS?
 Marchete: I thought you did N turns, like in normal bot play
 RoboStac: MSmits - it tends to overfit if you give it too many (at least on alphazero style as the exploration factors have much less effect)
 jacek: darkhorse64 like a0, during self-plays i only generate positions and  their targets and put into buffer. then during learning phase i train from that buffer
 MSmits: RoboStac thanks, good to know
 MSmits: but i suspect this varies a lot per game
 jacek: Marchete its mcts-ept
 jacek: yeah, for oware i have less, for others more or less but mostly 200
 Marchete: I'm too stupid for that sh*t :D
 MSmits: but might as well be jacekmax or full random rollout, it doesnt matter right? As long as you get a node value
 MSmits: will depend on the game what works best
 jacek: well random would be too stochastic no?
 MSmits: yeah i guess so
 RoboStac: possibly - alphazero did 1600, muzero but they'd reduced it down to 50 by muzero
 MSmits: but you could use minimax
 RoboStac: though thats a slightly different architecture
 jacek: yeah at first i used minimax and learned using texel tuning method on minimax score, just like they do now with nnue
 MSmits: btw, when you see 200 iterations, do you mean you eval 200 nodes? Or do you eval 200 times all children of a node
 MSmits: when you say
 darkhorse64: Is there a reference paper/book that explain all that&#160;?
 RoboStac: the alphazero papers / pseudocode are fairly understandable compared to most papers I found
 jacek: 200 iterations - selection, expansion, 'rollout', backpropagation
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0">https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0</a>
 MSmits: ah ok, just 1 node then. I am just asking because most of the time i eval multiple nodes for 1 iteration
 jacek: i dont use policy and i my net isnt convnet
 jacek: MSmits on expansion i expand every children and give them eval
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: so you eval way more than 200 nodes
 MSmits: then 200 doesn't seem so little 
 jacek: yeah
 darkhorse64: I have skimmed google for hours but found nothing better than tons of TF without explanations. Thx for the pointers 
 Marchete: jacekmax is poor man's alphazero :D
 MSmits: mcts ept is poor man's a0
 MSmits: jacekmax is different
 Marchete: not the NN part
 MSmits: hmm does a0 backprop max value?
 Marchete: he "sacrifices" policy 
 jacek: actually theyre quite interchangable, its the backprop that differs
 MSmits: or average value?
 Marchete: and reuse value for policy
 jacek: a0 use average
 MSmits: so i was right
 MSmits: mcts ept is poor mans a0
 jacek: who can afford policy these days when GPU are expensive&#160;:(
 MSmits: when games are simple enough you may just not need it
 MSmits: just like convnet
 jacek: amazons has been approved, time for your new meta
 MSmits: it's expensive to run right? So maybe with 50 ms, it's better to just do a mlp
 MSmits: instead of convnet
 SimpleNick: maybe who know where start enter point in chapter in use resource control memory, i have see my resource in GPU and PC in a real time
 MSmits: not gonna do a meta mcts for amazons, not much point to it, already did one for clobber and that was fairly useless
 darkhorse64: this cheat sheet is really great&#160;! I already found many answers to my questions in the first bubble
 RoboStac: policies are just extra outputs for your eval network - theres no reason it has to be much more expensive and it helps a lot
 jacek: i was thinking of training policy. but at first i must understand softmax prime backpropagation. once again there are many maths but no easy readable pseudocode&#160;:(
 jacek: i wish there was xor example for softmax - instead of regression it would output 2 values
 MSmits: RoboStac does it help on oware also? Jacek is competitive withou tit
 Marchete: but policy doesn't affect training or something?
 jacek: oware has little policy. perhaps its better for games with bigger policy, because you ask NN once for the probabilities
 Marchete: or how is the gradient done?
 RoboStac: when I tried with / without it was much better with, but I didn't do much investigation into how much smaller I could make the NN if I removed it
 RoboStac: yeah, backprop on multiple outputs was where I gave up on any interest in removing tensorflow from my workflow
 MSmits: also RoboStac, oware might not be a good game to test nn methods on if you want to know what works and what doesn't. It's too simple. It may just be a good game to learn on
 MSmits: the NN's on there mostly play perfectly. 
 SimpleNick: i think NN logic  = logic transistor, and counter ijk
 MSmits: with very rare mistakes
 darkhorse64: Have you tried Neural Network from Scratch in Python from sentdex. He has a YT channel which is very noob friendly and use sofmax
 darkhorse64: softmax
 SimpleNick: nn graph)
 struct: ill watch it ty
 jacek: does he use libs?
 darkhorse64: only numpy
 SimpleNick: cascad or cpu have more million or billion transistor and have binary memory too
 jacek: import nn; nn.train(); weee! we trained the network!
 SimpleNick: but nn it program
 darkhorse64: yeah, that sums up many sites content
 Astrobytes: +1
 SimpleNick: so theme NN it Schem programmers
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: does anyone know how long i should wait before I can play escape game?
 struct: wait?
 Astrobytes: Just wait until your team mates are ready then start
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: Yea when i sign up, i get a number
 struct: ah, no idea what that numbers means sorry
 Astrobytes: Number of invites?
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: Alright, but it sounds like u know how to start?
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: do i have to invite 5 friends or so?
 struct: You can invite up to 5 I think
 King_Coda: does it say 20/20 invites left?
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: it just as "You are current #26, invite ur friends" and then there is a link
 King_Coda: huh
 struct: Maybe they have a queue system now?
 struct: When I registered there wasnt any of that sorry
 King_Coda: yeah me neither
 King_Coda: maybe #26 on the leaderboard?
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: i dont think so, one of my friends just got #1
 King_Coda: maybe he was the first person to register, and you're the 26th?
 Astrobytes: I have no idea. Ask on the discord perhaps?
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: yea imma ask on discord, thanks for trying anyways guys!
 Astrobytes: Sorry I don't have more info
 King_Coda: Yeah I have no idea what that number means
 MathiasRerup-dyberg: dont be, glad for the info u had
 King_Coda: MathiasRerup-dyberg, let me know what you find, because I'm curious as to what that number means as well
 Astrobytes: +1
 King_Coda: +1?
 Astrobytes: me too
 King_Coda: ah, of course
 Astrobytes: I agree, one more vote, etc
 King_Coda: yeah yeah, makes sense
 Scarfield: ++
 Astrobytes: IncrementalField
 Scarfield: sounds like a dangerous place
 King_Coda: HTML5 is such an inefficient language
 King_Coda: it takes so long just to type one thing
 Astrobytes: Could be dangerous indeed.
 Scarfield: DangerBites
 struct: an error that occurs on debug but doesnt happen on release is safe?
 Astrobytes: Pff. Obviously. Deploy immediately :P
 struct: I was using nth_element(&amp;arr[0], &amp;arr[0] + 10, &amp;arr[5]);
 struct: on debug it doesnt work because 10 is higher than 5
 struct: on release it works fine
 struct:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Err yeah. Don't do that.
 Scarfield: why &amp;arr[0], and not just arr?
 struct: For me its easier to look at 
 Scarfield: fair enough, shouldnt 2nd argument be &amp;arr[10] though?
 struct: it wasnt on my code
 struct: and it worked fine
 struct: I think
 SimpleNick: new 10 no?
 SimpleNick: occured beacause not memory
 SimpleNick: maybe you new 5
 SimpleNick: and use 10
 struct: _STL_VERIFY(_First &lt;= _Last, "transposed pointer range");
 struct: #if _ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL&#160;!= 0
 struct: I think its more of a warning
 Astrobytes: doesn't it just need to be nth_element(arr, arr + size, arr + nth element)
 struct: Ill fix it anyways
 Astrobytes: *size-1 (last element that is)
 Scarfield: the arguments are (first, nth, last), what is the point of doing nth_element with nth not between first and last?
 Astrobytes: heheh, sorry, I mixed those up
 Astrobytes: AstroShytes
 Scarfield: JobbyBytes
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Better than BiteaJobby I guess

 Astrobytes: I like it SimpleNick )
 struct: ok I watched a video and now I understand nth_element
 Zicrix: i want to learn how to code but idk how to code 
 Astrobytes: Presumably the fact you don't know how to code is why you want to learn to code no? This makes your statement a little redundant.
 Butanium: is that the good typo to add a json agent in test main&#160;? 
 Butanium:         gameRunner.addAgent("json /testMaxime.js");
 Scarfield: Zicrix this site is not the best place to start, if you dont know any coding at all. The fundamentals are needed, but with a few videos you can try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>

 VizGhar: look at his achievements... maybe they are enough for lvl 3... first levels are insanely fast
 VizGhar: I got like 10 levels first day here
 struct: You probably get level 10+ if you get gold on csb
 Astrobytes: Is that the Lua guy from earlier I wonder?
 Astrobytes: Half the chat seems to be the same people with different accounts these past few weeks
 Scarfield: im part of the 5% without an alt apparently
 SimpleNick: i have 1 account
 Astrobytes: I have an alt
 struct: I havent loged on an alt for a long time
 struct: I have like 5
 VizGhar: I'm bronze on CSB... didn't like it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: it's cricri10000 or something
 VizGhar: maybe later
 Astrobytes: I only know the nulte one
 Scarfield: Nick Nulte?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: well the nick is nulte but not nick nolte
 Scarfield: xD was afraid the pun would be lost
 Astrobytes: That sentence pleased me.
 Astrobytes: No, not lost at all :D
 Astrobytes: DrollField
 Scarfield: "a jester or entertainer; a buffoon." xD
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 SimpleNick: GreenGoblin)
 struct: This nth_element seems magic
 struct: my brain cant keep up
 DomiKo: it's like quick sort
 struct: so all values from the left of nth will be higher?
 struct: after its done
 DomiKo: yeah
 struct: Thanks
 struct: I think I got it this time
 DomiKo: np
 struct: Maybe I wont need to call my teacher this time
 Scarfield: i saw it used to find the median of an unsorted array ealier today
 Scarfield: but when the nth is larger than last argument, i have no idea what it does?
 struct: you dont need to worry
 struct: just trust your code
 struct:  /s
 Scarfield: but can i trust your code?
 Scarfield: :p
 Astrobytes: jacek: Friendship In Disguise
 struct: Bad stuff happens probably
 struct: let me check
 Scarfield: " I was using nth_element(&amp;arr[0], &amp;arr[0] + 10, &amp;arr[5]); " you said this ealier, i am still curious what its supposed to do?&#160;:)
 struct: it still sorts but only up to the last one
 struct: Im just not sure if its safe
 struct: by sorting i mean it still does what it supposed to do
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/uZyllJR">https://tech.io/snippet/uZyllJR</a>
 struct: remember last is non inclusive 
 struct: or w/e is the term
 struct: msvc throws error though on debug mode
 struct: please dont revoke my coding license
 Astrobytes: what are you trying to do?
 struct: it works now
 jacek: puns! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aoMWwGA_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aoMWwGA_700bwp.webp</a>
 struct: is just for beam search
 Scarfield: but if it sorts between 1st and last, and nth is larger than last the nth would be unchanged?
 struct: oh I see what you mean
 Astrobytes: The element pointed at by nth is changed to whatever element would occur in that position if [first, last) were sorted.
 Astrobytes: so specify the range (ie. [...) )
 Astrobytes: usw
 Astrobytes: or etc if you're feeling less German
 Astrobytes: jacek: Friendship in Disguise tho. Have you not seen this.
 Scarfield: yes astro, but when the nth is outside of the sorted range, the nth would be the same as arr[nth] no?
 Scarfield: ooh, never mind, i misunderstood what it does
 Astrobytes: Hmmm
 jacek: Astrobytes?
 jacek: oh my
 Astrobytes: You hadn't seen it? A friend who's into comic books just posted it on our discord. I'm... not sure what to say
 struct: Ban dont say anthing
 jacek: "a friend" eh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, he's into comics but not ponies, but kinda liked the crossover.
 Astrobytes: Can't stand either myself
 Astrobytes: "The Magic of Cybertron" is coming soon apparently&#160;:/
 jacek: mlp has official comics but i havent seen this one
 jacek: and transformers are silly
 Astrobytes: I regard both as silly
 Astrobytes: But I suppose at least the ponies have some kind of message
 Astrobytes: That's all the praise you're getting from me.
 Astrobytes: Only comics I was ever really into were the Dark Horse Aliens ones.
 King_Coda: #ChugJugWithYou
 darkhorse64: mm 
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Dark Horse is a publisher darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: King_Coda: wtf
 jacek: dark pony?
 King_Coda: what?
 King_Coda: it's Chug Jug With You
 Astrobytes: I don't know what that is. I'm 38, I don't give a flying jobby about Fortnite.
 King_Coda: Some song that a 12 year old made I think
 Astrobytes: ...
 Mageplate: is it only clash of code and escape room that you can play with your friends?
 Astrobytes: Directly yes
 Astrobytes: But you can compete in multiplayer by trying to get better placement in the leagues or whatever, better score in optim or code golf etc
 orangesnowfox: I wonder if we'll ever see a competition where there's a split single player / team leaderboards, would be interesting to see
 Astrobytes: Doubt that will happen but yeah
 davilla: is KitKat still around?
 Astrobytes: Lots of other competitions have teams of 1 or more 
 Astrobytes: Our resident person who goes "hi", "hi", "hello", "hru", "what" all day davilla? Why?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!
 Astrobytes: Hii
 King_Coda: Hello!
 King_Coda: hru
 davilla: they wanted to do a puzzle, and I'd offered maybe later
 King_Coda: i don't think they're on
 Astrobytes: I suspect there may be better team mates, don't let me influence your decision however
 Boogle: fortnite
 King_Coda: indeed
 King_Coda: what
 King_Coda: #ChugJugWithYou
 King_Coda: click on that Boogle
 King_Coda: I need to make a graph of this chat's activity
 King_Coda: it likes to just drop off randomly sometimes
 Astrobytes: It's not random.
 MadKnight: i'm trying to get file id on google drive using google drive api in c#, but on google i only see how to do stuff using the file id that u already have
 MadKnight: guys can u help me find how to get file id on google drive by its path&#160;?
 MadKnight: Astrobytes&#160;?
 King_Coda: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://markheath.net/post/list-and-download-google-drive-cs">https://markheath.net/post/list-and-download-google-drive-cs</a>
 King_Coda: maybe this will help MadKnight?
 MadKnight: well this is a direct http query and not a drive api library usage but...
 MadKnight: why not
 King_Coda: yw
 MadKnight: wait what is - publicFolderId
 MadKnight: i don't have the folder id
 King_Coda: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/4wj98k3bbQsLRuiWm-PrQlRfkrEP6lbNg?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/4wj98k3bbQsLRuiWm-PrQlRfkrEP6lbNg?usp=sharing</a>
 King_Coda: "4wj98k3bbQsLRuiWm-PrQlRfkrEP6lbNg?usp=sharing"
 King_Coda: "4wj98k3bbQsLRuiWm-PrQlRfkrEP6lbNg"
 MadKnight: i only got name
 King_Coda: that's your folder id
 King_Coda: the folder id is in the url
 MadKnight: but i don't have it
 MadKnight: i wanna get it by its name using api
 King_Coda: i don't think you can?
 MadKnight: well rip
 MadKnight: then i can just use file id instead
 MadKnight: anyway
 MadKnight: what are u up to King_Coda 
 MadKnight:&#160;?
 King_Coda: thats a lot easier than what you're trying to do
 King_Coda: oh, just practicing my typing
 King_Coda: typing out a bunch of stuff in HTML5
 King_Coda: trying to get faster at typing when coding
 MadKnight: i wanted it to receive the actual file id from path instead of hardcoding it into the code
 King_Coda: yeah, with the way google makes it's stuff, that's virtually impossible
 MadKnight: &gt; just practicing my typingwell it all depends on how smart u are
 King_Coda:&#160;?
 MadKnight: noone thinks about that but your level of iq and all that stuff directly affects your trainability
 King_Coda: Yeah it does
 MadKnight: even at such basic things as typing fast
 King_Coda:  havent taken an iq test since i was a small child, so I don't know what my iq is
 King_Coda: my typing speed currently is about 30 wpm, which is below average
 MadKnight: well it won't help u
 MadKnight: taking that test won't change your speed
 MadKnight: we need a new science researc
 MadKnight: h
 MadKnight: - correlation between the best people can get their typing speed to and their iq
 MadKnight: i really wanna see that
 MadKnight: just for the memes 
 MadKnight: King_Coda i have no idea how fast 30 is
 King_Coda: 30 is below average, 40-45 is average
 MadKnight: do u look at the keyboard while typing&#160;?
 King_Coda: yes i do
 MadKnight: well that's the problem
 MadKnight: it slows u down
 King_Coda: also apparently my iq is from 109 to 125
 King_Coda: apparently that's above average
 MadKnight: just stop looking, u gotta navigate the keyboard using touch info
 King_Coda: i can do it
 MadKnight: cool
 King_Coda: im doing it rifht now
 King_Coda: as tou can see my accuraxy decarexes
 MadKnight: now practice the speed like that
 MadKnight: i'm sure your speed will increase by a lot just from u not looking at kb
 King_Coda: hmm, yeah i guess you might be right
 MadKnight: now to actually important questions King_Coda
 MadKnight: be honest
 MadKnight: does my english sentence making sound very bad?
 Devilzwirn: I learned 10-Finger-System, just learn that and you can do easily 60 words in a minute
 MadKnight: King_Coda u code in which lang&#160;?
 King_Coda: MadKnight your english is fine
 King_Coda: I code in c++ right now
 MadKnight: King_Coda no i'm asking about my style how i make sentences
 MadKnight: the words that i use
 King_Coda: uh, no it sounds just fine
 King_Coda: i dont really usually analyze peoples sentence structures while they are talking
 MadKnight: i was only asking if something was so weird u noticed it without even analyzing
 King_Coda: I have "very superior intelligence" according to some doctors
 orangesnowfox: "some" doctors :think:
 MadKnight: well y'know, like when u watch terminator 5 and u feel like something ain't right....
 King_Coda: now i dont really know or care what that means, but when looking at your sentences i dont notice anything out of the ordinary
 MadKnight: well have u seen T5 or T6&#160;?
 King_Coda: "I have "very superior intelligence" according to some doctors" -&gt; "now i dont really know or care what that means, but when looking at your sentences i dont notice anything out of the ordinary"
 MadKnight: nono forget that
 MadKnight: i'm just asking if u have seen these movies
 King_Coda: no
 MadKnight: what about T2&#160;?
 MadKnight: it's a pretty popular movie
 MadKnight: okay nvm
 King_Coda: i havent watched any of the terminator movies
 King_Coda: i dont really care
 MadKnight: yea nvm
 MadKnight: so u code in c++? do u know any other langs&#160;?
 MadKnight: i've been coding in c++ a lot
 SimpleNick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/EXgXMa5kapI">https://youtu.be/EXgXMa5kapI</a>
 SimpleNick: Mad check this video)
 MadKnight: SimpleNick stop hiding, tell us the truth 
 MadKnight: u are a russian?
 King_Coda: oh, my typing speed is actually 50 wpm, it only slows down when I'm coding because of all the extra characters
 MadKnight: SimpleNick are u Cyberpunk&#160;?
 King_Coda: I'm learning c++ rn. after that I'll learn c#, then javascript.
 MadKnight: King_Coda well coding doesn't count because of all the extra chars
 MadKnight: King_Coda wait why c++ and then c#? it's supposed to be c# and then c++ cmon
 King_Coda:&#160;?
 King_Coda: oh
 SimpleNick: Mad thank you for mcts)
 MadKnight: c# is the simplified version of c++ King_Coda
 SimpleNick: i understand)
 MadKnight: SimpleNick are u cyberpunk
 King_Coda: ohhhh
 SimpleNick: :thumbsup:very nice tutorial ever:wink:
 MadKnight: SimpleNick pls
 MadKnight: let's go to #ru
 SimpleNick: i cant
 MadKnight: whyt
 SimpleNick: iam a ConstantBolzman
 MadKnight: dude if u get banned then u are not supposed to create more accounts to go around it
 Uljahn: why am i not surprized, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you mean what do you do with them
 SimpleNick: i dont create i finded norm nickname
 MadKnight: King_Coda hello from #ru
 MadKnight: King_Coda let's teach u c# and then ru
 SimpleNick: no i want new create i have this account and i think new puzzles in queue
 SimpleNick: want not
 MadKnight: SimpleNick ЛС
 MadKnight: ЛС means DM if anyone wonders
 Astrobytes: Oh SimpleNick is ConstantBoltzmann, I see
 MadKnight: instaban&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Not done anything ban-worthy in here yet
 Astrobytes: Annoying yes
 AntiSquid: ban circumvention
 MadKnight: tutubalin explained this
 Astrobytes: He was banned from ru?
 Astrobytes: Sorry I didn't see
 MadKnight: u are supposed to warn him for avoiding ban
 AntiSquid: i'd investigate how outrage i should be, but i am too sleepy, got to go sleep
 MadKnight: yea everyone was asking me to ban him from ru
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes probably banned him here if he is the guy who kept spamming to ban uljan for banning him on ru
 MadKnight: and he was like - "i didn't do anything to get banned!"
 AntiSquid: but if he is desperate to rejoin CG, why doesn't he shut up about who he is&#160;?
 MadKnight: he thinks he's right
 MadKnight: that he wasn't supposed to get banned 
 MadKnight: and that it's us who are wrong
 AntiSquid: at least should have kept low profile
 Astrobytes: Ban seems appropriate. CG chat this past 3 weeks/month has just been/is just full of sht
 Astrobytes: Not all ofc, but so much and so many of the same inane posts from the same accounts
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I was on my way to bed, so gn
 AntiSquid: same
 AntiSquid: gn8
 AntiSquid: madao you keep watch over the chat
 TheDrowningFish: sup gallas
 TheDrowningFish: fellas
 MadKnight: hey
 MadKnight: Automaton2000, this is some fishy guy
 Automaton2000: but he didnt say using it
 cegprakash: hi all
 MadKnight: oh hey ceg
 cegprakash: hi @MadKnight
 cegprakash: I just applied casual time off in my company for the entire contest
 cegprakash: last contest was ruined coz of office work
 cegprakash: I don't want that to happen
 MadKnight: and we got an entire week off in russia
 MadKnight: the next week
 cegprakash: how
 MadKnight: it's multiple holidays at once in russia
 MadKnight: one of them goes on different days every year
 cegprakash: i forgot all the tools i used in codingame
 cegprakash: like parameterfiddler
 MadKnight: they nerfed everything
 cegprakash: haha
 MadKnight: because the servers are too weak during contests
 cegprakash: but we can run it in local right
 cegprakash: can't we?
 MadKnight: ofc
 cegprakash: like with two bots of our own versions
 MadKnight: but u won't have all the enemies
 Smelty: hi
 MadKnight: it's not so useful to run it against your own bot cegprakash
 cegprakash: oh
 MadKnight: hihi Smelty
 Smelty: hi
 MadKnight: hi
 cegprakash: last 3 contests were about lot of hidden details we need to track enemies
 cegprakash: and guess him
 cegprakash: lot of fog of war
 cegprakash: I don't want another one of that kind :P
 cegprakash: even though it's good
 MadKnight: well let's go practice on some old contest cegprakash
 orangesnowfox: it is good, but something 0 sum perfect information would be neat
 cegprakash: I want to redo fantastic bits from scratch but I need to show a demo at work this week
 MadKnight: cegprakash let's go
 orangesnowfox: ... meanwhile I'm working on mars lander
 MadKnight: pt2 or 3&#160;?
 cegprakash: I'll join next week
 cegprakash: u continue maddy
 cegprakash: gn&#160;:)
 cegprakash: it's 4AM here
 MadKnight: well pt3 is not even easier than his game
 cegprakash: and I'll unmute u on discord till contest ends :P
 MadKnight: lol
 orangesnowfox: The part 2 opt technically, but I suppose the general solution
 MadKnight: oooooh i remember how it ended last time now
 Smelty: h  m mm m m 
 MadKnight: didn't go well cegprakash
 Smelty: sad
 MadKnight: will it go differently this time&#160;?
 MadKnight: Smelty why
 Smelty: um...because it didnt go well
 MadKnight: Smelty what are u talking about
 MadKnight: the thing we were discussing?
 MadKnight: Smelty don't worry about it
 MadKnight: better tell me what u are coding right now
 Smelty: o.o
 Smelty: weekli puzzli

 5DN1L: please let's not drill into that
 Troph: Hi everyone, I am stuck with langton's ant bot programming and would like some pointers. I am doing it in python and can only do 1.000  random simulations with a very basic algorithm. I don't know where to start to improve it
 eulerscheZahl: which programming language?
 5DN1L: he said python
 eulerscheZahl: oh, reading skills...
 eulerscheZahl: sorry
 eulerscheZahl: i get around 45-50k in C#
 eulerscheZahl: i'd say porting to C# can get you around 20k at least. porting to C++ and your sims are on par with mine
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, we have different map sizes in this game
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think, that this game has any shortcuts to significantly speed up the simulation
 eulerscheZahl: i can just provide reference numbers: 20k-ish for 34x34 map size and 132 turns<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/639704180">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/639704180</a>
 Troph: Doing it in C I can do around 25k simulations, but I see people above me using python so I am wondering what I am doing wrong
 eulerscheZahl: what i do: compute the next few empty cells, that the ant will pass. only allow to play there and not anywhere
 eulerscheZahl: then minimax me vs opponent
 Troph: I am not even at the fighting the opponent on the same board stage
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, first leagues are single player
 Troph: Stuck in wood 4, using C I could go up, but I'd rather fix it before
 eulerscheZahl: i struggled harder with those than i should have. passing with simulation and then adding minimax put me quite high already
 Troph: what I do is I generate random moves, then simulate the ant's move and keeping the sequence that does the best score
 StevenV: wow wood5 the first time I see this
 Troph: for each turn
 eulerscheZahl: try to only simulate empty cells which you will pass (and probably which are somewhat early in your path)
 Troph: hmmm, that could be indeed a solution, I'd need to switch to a completely new approach

 jacek: Troph do you use pragmas to compile C code in release mode?
 darianleking: shut up
 kenaubry: cheh
 5DN1L: kicked out :shrug:
 Troph: jacek I do not know what pragmas is
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html</a>
 struct: This is what I use
 struct: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer","inline")
 struct: If you paste it on top of the file it should work
 struct: The last one should not be needed I guess
 struct: Without Ofast I go from 3Mill to 300k sims per second
 Troph: oh, that will really improve my C code
 Troph: thanks
 struct: I use it on c++ but I think it should also work for C
 jacek: it should be pasted above #includes
 struct: Finally reached 4M sims but same rank ...
 jacek: stc?

 struct: I meant rollouts
 struct: on c4 but was only 1 game
 struct: I think my bot must be bugged
 jacek: 10x faster should be noticeable better no matter what
 struct: yeah but its not 10x its 20x
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: by now it should emerge self-consciousness
 struct: 20x should not be 0.5 elo dfference 
 jacek: trueskill*
 struct: on the leaderboard
 struct: ok trueskill
 jacek: when i first added pragmas to uttt, i went from bottom of legend to top 25%
 jacek: that was 3x faster
 jacek: woah im 3rd
 struct: I would check c4 but I rather spend my time elsewhere
 struct: I wont learn much form rewriting it anyways
 struct: jacek would ttt be a good place to start to apply a NN or do you think its too hard?
 jacek: yeah, its good to start
 jacek: although ttt requires surprisngly many nodes or layers to play perfectly
 jacek: maybe hexapawn would be easier
 struct: 3x3 breakthrough?
 Akex06: hey
 jacek: not exactly as you can diagonal only to capture
 struct: ah I see
 j4at: I gave up on my spider attack NN. I made it work but the problem that it so big(21.5m paramaters for the actor) and slow for CodinGame :p Size is very important for transformers. Shrinknig it makes it very bad.
 struct: j4at you could try on a simpler game I guess
 struct: When I'm able to make it work I would choose breakthrough
 struct: I will choose*
 j4at: Well, I can try with another NN architecture. I will try a simpler game first. Any suggestions&#160;?
 struct: Yes, breakthrough, oware
 struct: or onitama
 struct: but jacek has more experience on this
 struct: Maybe he can suggest one
 j4at: okay, ty&#160;:)
 jacek: oware would be simplest
 jacek: or you could try this actor-critic thing in single player - search race
 DomiKo: I believe that every simple game for NN have one common flaw. It's hard for you to understand if your boy is doing something meaningful
 struct: DomiKo even on bt?
 struct: its an easy game to check if your bot is doing poorly or not imo
 DomiKo: OK deciding if it's completely trash or not isn't that hard
 jacek: thats what leaderboard is for
 struct: well on breakthrough there is only two types of bots, trash and not trash
 jacek: thats why i like CG - i can see if my bot is good, at least not crap
 DomiKo: Worst when you see that your bot is bad, you don't know why
 jacek: because you copied your brain into NN :v
 j4at: Search race seems perfect&#160;:) 
 j4at: I will give it a shot
 DomiKo: Yeah, storing entire brain in some linear layers isn't the best idea, I  guess
 DomiKo: And one question in Oware P1 loses? or draws?
 jacek: my alt is 27th, and this is NN
 jacek: normal oware is draw. maybe turn limit changes that
 DomiKo: ok thanks
 emh: hmm I have some fast bitfiddling algos for StC but I never got around to submitting a bot with it
 struct: derjack is also NN jacek?
 emh: struct what's your optimized numbers for StC on flood fills?
 struct: Not that much
 struct: I get like 1M random plays per turn
 emh: ahh ok
 struct: but 1M with pieces drop and floodiflls
 struct: so 1M moves
 emh: with regular flood fill I get around 400k, with bit optimized 1.6M. but that's just the floodfills. and lonesome pieces are removed with a bit operation first
 emh: on my laptop that is. should check online
 struct: I get like 50% of what I get locally 
 emh: ahh ok. I got 1M instead of 1.6M online
 struct: but floodfills or moves?
 emh: floodfills only
 emh: so yours seems fast
 emh: but it depends how densely I populate the random matrices
 struct: I do normal floofill
 emh: ahh ok
 struct: but there is a few optimization you can do
 struct: to not use it as much
 struct: I only check floodfill on pieces that were affected 
 eulerscheZahl: now you just have to find a way to utilize your sims and climb the ladder
 emh: I see
 emh: hehe yes euler
 struct: also I take into account color count of each piece
 struct: maybe if you divide it into regions it can also help
 struct: But I dont do the 2nd part
 eulerscheZahl: i don't try a flood fill, if there are only 3 of that color on the board. is that what you mean?
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: there was a time when i was trying hard
 struct: I only try to floodfill if there is more than 3 and if the piece moved
 struct: either it was placed or if it dropped after a piece was removed
 eulerscheZahl: i have that too
 emh: I have a bitboard per color
 eulerscheZahl: and here i'm out, no bit board for me
 eulerscheZahl: marchete does
 struct: I also only add if it has a neighbor next to it of the same color
 struct: But that is probably not neede
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't sound that color to me
 emh: I wrote my bit stuff for StC at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/5f1a3b2bee0e0fc11ee2d14e0fc3a40983085/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard">https://tech.io/playgrounds/5f1a3b2bee0e0fc11ee2d14e0fc3a40983085/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard</a> long time ago

 emh: ahh sorry
 emh: that link was wrong
 emh: here is it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/58038/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard">https://tech.io/playgrounds/58038/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard</a>
 eulerscheZahl: half of my time is used for eval anyways
 struct: My performance is similar to the grid one
 eulerscheZahl: but one version is more likely to break at some CG update than the other
 struct: update whats that?
 eulerscheZahl: i rare this that happens right before a [contest](definition missing)
 emh: with average 10 bits on the board or so I get 2.3M flood fills on CG
 MSmits: DomiKo yeah normal oware draws and it is very likely the turn limit does not change that.
 struct: how do you count floodfills emh?
 MSmits: also there are many routes to a draw. 
 eulerscheZahl: 5 colors? =&gt; 5 flood fills per turn
 emh: struct a board of 6x12 bits, split into its connected components (one 6x12 bitboard per each)
 eulerscheZahl: only 1 stone of a color? fast flood fill
 emh: eulerscheZahl yes I have to do flood fill per color
 emh: 5 per turn yes
 struct: Ok I do it individually per bit that was changed
 struct: Maybe I should change that
 struct: Maybe I should write eval first instead of wasting time on this...
 eulerscheZahl: no. that's your signature move: optimizing performance but close to no eval
 struct: found this while looking for hexapawn, it might be useful for someone I guess, I havent read it yet but I think I will <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/neural_network_chess">https://github.com/asdfjkl/neural_network_chess</a>

 Ninjatron: the only company to give me an offer were all ex-googlers
 Ninjatron: i am applying to companies far weaker, but get rejected anyway
 Wontonimo: do you dress perfectly ordinarily?  Like a typical middle aged office worker who has no individuality?
 Wontonimo: or do you have anything that shows your individuality or culture?
 Ninjatron: i mean all interviews are virtual nowadays, never had an in office interview
 Wontonimo: video?
 Ninjatron: yes
 Wontonimo: and how about my question about dress?
 Ninjatron: i tried to dress like i cared, a nice shirt and that's all they see anyway
 StraumliPerversion: Are you a sociopath?
 Ninjatron: nowadays i do the opposite since i started to think everything i do must be wrong :D
 Ninjatron: i just wear a sweatshirt
 Ninjatron: lol am I socipath? what kind of socipath would say "yes" :D
 Wontonimo: oh, that's StraumliPerversion, he may just be asking his other personality
 Wontonimo: or me
 Wontonimo: who knows really
 Wontonimo: well, sorry to hear about your job prospects.
 StraumliPerversion: more of a schizoid, but yeah.
 Ninjatron: yes, well idc that much anymore, at this point learning all that i can and will build a company myself
 MrZee: As a fellow sociopath I could welcome you to the society
 MrZee: That's kind of my mindset now, I've been trying to get into game design for years so I've decided I'm just going to start making my own games
 Ninjatron: well, games make no money generally
 MrZee: Kickstarters do lol
 Ninjatron: lol and never deliver
 Ninjatron: "give me money i will build you an infinitely open sandbox world by myself, i need $65.000"
 Ninjatron: :D
 MrZee: I don't remember if it was Kickstarter or Gofundme, but somebody made a complete game and then opened a kickstarter just saying "buy me a pizza for building this game" and got like over $10,000 from backers lol
 Ninjatron: i want to checkout man, i am tired of this nonsense, i don't want to ever apply for a job $10000 isn't enough for that
 StraumliPerversion: if it helps, you'll probably be dead in 100 years. 
 Ninjatron: yeah, imagining to probability of being alive past 2100s did make me feel good
 MrZee: I'm somewhere between the "At least I'll be dead before long" and the "I wish I could be immortal and learn all of the things" mentalities
 MrZee: I might be a lich, idk
 Ninjatron: that sounds defeatist
 Ninjatron: i want to embarrass a lot of people really
 StraumliPerversion: I'm starting to guess the problem is you talk too much in the interview.
 Ninjatron: i tried it all
 Ninjatron: talk a lot, don't talk a lot, only answer questions, pretend i love collaboration, pretend i am an individual contributor
 therealbeef: don't beat yourself up too much; many interviewers don't know how to interview. Especially HR people
 Ninjatron: yes, i don't really beat myself up, i just accepted there is no justice. i will build my own thing.
 multii: hi
 antiwonto: [automated] 'hi' was defined as ' A common salutation for those who are short of words ' by Wontonimo
 MrZee: Seems legit
 lord8080: I'm practicing here for an interview, I haven't code in a bit more than a year and I'm a bit rusty
 java_coffee_cup: Depends on what u'r interviewing. Not everyone needs to code.
 lord8080: it's for backend development
 YS_Yousef: MrZee
 MrZee: msg/ YS_Yousef
 MrZee: Doh, that didn't work lol
 MrZee: Oh I guess I misunderstood that purple text was a private message lol
 MrZee: What's up?
 YS_Yousef: good
 YS_Yousef: I think i will remove the comments from my solution because without them my code 30 with them my code 78
 YS_Yousef: line*
 MrZee: You could add the comments to the same lines as the code
 YS_Yousef: oh yea thx i didn't think in this XD
 MrZee: No problem lol
 YS_Yousef: ok nice i edited it now and it is 35 line nice
 MrZee: Nice, mine is super long lmao
 YS_Yousef: XD
 Andriamanitra: o god python people come up with some terrible code
 Andriamanitra: i don't like how it makes you choose one or the other in the review thingy
 MrZee: I can't judge lol, my code is never clean
 Husoski: The weird thing is that sometimes neither of the choices to judge are among the published solutions.  I wonder what that's all about...
 Uljahn: you can just skip it
 JohntheHacker: hi
 JohntheHacker: hello?
 JohntheHacker: :grinning:
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Thorcode: hi JohntheHacker
 Thorcode: how can I find the current puzzle of the week
 Ronins: Hello
 Thorcode: hi
 Ronins:  I am new to code in game
 Thorcode: ok
 Ronins: nice guy
 Thorcode: thx
 Ronins: What now
 Thorcode: what you want to do bruh 
 Ronins: You want to fight
 5DN1L: Calm down
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 Ronins: You again
 Thorcode: well I'm fighting with him 5d XD
 5DN1L: You do it in your private chat channel
 5DN1L: not World chat
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: I talked to him
 Thorcode: and how can't I see the current puzzle of the week
 5DN1L: it's now become an event
 5DN1L: go to ACTIVITIES
 5DN1L: then EVENTS
 5DN1L: and JOIN
 Ronins: I know that
 Thorcode: ah okay
 Thorcode: I just know that
 apcoder: guys suggestions for learning graph, tree data structures
 Thorcode: because I'm trying the coin guessing game
 Ronins: Go to your private chat
 YS_Yousef: coin guessing game was ez right?
 5DN1L: Ronins stop being disruptive or I'll kick you out
 YS_Yousef: what is disruptive?
 MrZee: apcoder, I've been taking a udemy course on pathfinding and someone on this site also recommended redblobgames.com to me
 apcoder: Thanks!! I'll look into it
 YS_Yousef: I have a question i am in a game and the question say fil all bits of a number don't flip leading zeros and 1001 become 0110 how?
 YS_Yousef: flip*
 5DN1L: what do you mean by "how"?
 Uljahn: replace 0 with 2, then 1 with 0, then 2 with 1 :upside_down:
 YS_Yousef: i mean with how that this is not real 1001 become 1001
 YS_Yousef: if flip it
 Uljahn: or xor with 1111
 YS_Yousef: ok thx bro
 5DN1L: ah you thought flip was like mirror image / palindrome-flip
 YS_Yousef: yea
 5DN1L: usually flipping the bits means 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0, like flipping a switch
 YS_Yousef: ok thx i solved it
 5DN1L: :clap:
 Hackker: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: amazing
 YS_Yousef: what is the amazing bro
 Hackker: for solving the problem
 Idk.-_-: hi&#160;:)
 Idk.-_-: somone has any idea for ASCII Art puzzle&#160;?
 5DN1L: What's your idea so far
 Idk.-_-: i mea'n help :D
 5DN1L: i mean you have to think first before asking for help
 Idk.-_-: i know
 Idk.-_-: but i can't think
 Sl0ppy: i need help translating smth to eng :D
 Sl0ppy: for clash contribution :D
 5DN1L: what's that smth
 Idk.-_-: how can i pick for example e in row&#160;?
 Sl0ppy: i'll give roughly the situoation i'm in
 5DN1L: Idk.-_- use maths
 Idk.-_-: index number&#160;?

 Sl0ppy: what is _________
 Sl0ppy: in my language we say "received"
 Sl0ppy: but i don't think it works for eng
 Idk.-_-: i'm terrible at mat&#160;:(((
 5DN1L: Sl0ppy which is the product of m and p? or which is obtained by multiplying m and p?
 5DN1L: obtained/calculated
 5DN1L: arrived at
 Sl0ppy: obtained sounds cool
 Sl0ppy: cause iu pretty much have to apply a function over and over again until u arrive at a single digit number
 5DN1L: oh, looks like the multiplication version of sum of digits
 Sl0ppy: kinda
 Sl0ppy: i'll submit it soon
 5DN1L: ok
 Sl0ppy: but pretty much u "need" to find n!
 Sl0ppy: and then keep summing the sum of sum of digits, etc
 Sl0ppy: until u arrive at 1 digit
 Sl0ppy: and i smh have to express that in "output"
 5DN1L: i'll take a look when you've submitted it
 Sl0ppy: Line 1: A number less than 10, obtained by continuously applying digit sum starting from n! 
 Sl0ppy: how does that sound
 5DN1L: erm, i think you make your contribution WIP first
 5DN1L: then i'll comment from there
 Sl0ppy: :D
 5DN1L: Idk.-_- do you know anything about ascii values?
 5DN1L: if not, google and take a look
 Uljahn: also there are some hints on the left
 Idk.-_-: you min ord&#160;?
 5DN1L: yup
 Idk.-_-: mean
 Idk.-_-: damn it :D
 Idk.-_-: xD
 Idk.-_-: so ord of E is 69
 5DN1L: yup, then do some y=ax+b stuff
 Sl0ppy: i submitted it
 Sl0ppy: and i'm going 4 lunch
 Sl0ppy: i'll check ur review later
 Uljahn: that solution :joy:

 Idk.-_-: hmmm 
 Idk.-_-: still confused xD
 Idk.-_-: E index is will be print(row[16:20]) but i dont know how
 Idk.-_-: calculate it
 Uljahn: use width and index
 5DN1L: Idk.-_- start from a, b, c... find a pattern
 codefrero: how can i learn phyton?
 5DN1L: you learn by reading and practising
 codefrero: wtf ahahahaha
 Moduus: 5DN1L "A hero we don't deserve, but a hero we need"
 5DN1L: Why that quote?
 Idk.-_-: i think E ined in abcde is 4 becuase starts from 0 and 4*4 = 16 and 4*5 = 20 right or wrong&#160;? :D
 Uljahn: ye, almost
 Moduus: Just reading the questions on this chat while doing puzzles and appreciate the energy :smile:

 5DN1L: energy required
 5DN1L: brain juice required
 derjack: brain runs more efficiently on ketones [solved]
 5DN1L: ketones are inflammable, hence brainburn 🔥
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 how's your database doing?
 Automaton2000: it is different from the test cases in clash of code

 Automaton2000: i am trying to create a contest
 YS_Yousef: BRUH
 YS_Yousef: Automaton2000 hello
 Automaton2000: did you check out the source code is available
 YS_Yousef: idk
 MrZee: Man it looks like only 4 other people solved the Coin Guessing game in C# for this event lol, there's so few C# coders left it seems
 YS_Yousef: i am a c# coder
 MrZee: YS_Yousef :taco:
 MrZee: I thought that was how tacos got gifted lol

 Automaton2000: is there anything i can do more than just a few minutes
 Fasader: what is this taco business?
 Wontonimo: for glory
 Wontonimo: :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] ':taco:' was defined as ' A currency to some, sustenance for others ' by Wontonimo

 eulerscheZahl: test
 eulerscheZahl: that one worked recently
 ssMoody: test1
 ssMoody: test2
 Wontonimo: 10 / hour limit.  with 1/5min recharge
 ssMoody: test3
 Wontonimo: once antiwonto goes over its limit, it will sleep for 1 hour and then be fully recharged.
 Wontonimo: you can tell when it goes to sleep because it appends [sleeping] to its last message
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i thought it was defined by a sleeping struct
 Wontonimo: lol
 NeelD31: how do i get rid of the template code when i play clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: crtl+A, del
 struct: ^
 Wontonimo: ^^
 NeelD31: ik that 
 NeelD31: but i want to keep some of it
 NeelD31: but not all of it
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 NeelD31: is there a setting to change the template at the start
 struct: no
 <b>**eulerscheZahl laughs at you</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: just change it, using like your mouse and keyboard
 NeelD31: anyone knows what the OUCC is?
 eulerscheZahl: our universal coding contest
 struct: did you want to change how inputs read?
 Calastian: :grimacing:
 Calastian: Sometimes I just wanna learn a new language without having to search through thousands of tutorials without proper documentation
 Calastian: T_T
 Calastian: IDK where to start
 Astrobytes: then look up the official language docs
 Astrobytes: If you know one language you can surely pick up another quickly, assuming no major difference wrt paradigm or whatever
 Calastian: Thanks!~
 struct: still no art for the contest :thinking:
 struct: I guess 3D is hard to draw
 ninjadip: 4d is even harder
 Astrobytes: Time/resources issue I would assume
 Magmi: What is your rank on codeforces?
 eulerscheZahl: don't they hire external artists for contest covers?
 Astrobytes: They were doing so at some point, not sure about these days
 struct: no graphics needed its text based
 eulerscheZahl: there's Gabi, I know she did the OoC font
 Astrobytes: lol struct, at least the 'viewer' would be stable
 struct: I only have viewer problems on mad pod racing
 Astrobytes: I haven't checked any recently
 struct: also on bit runner old replays dont seem to work
 struct: its around 1 year old
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/537205979">https://www.codingame.com/replay/537205979</a>
 struct: it only seem to bug on nulte replays
 struct: Maybe im doing something
 struct: ah I think I know
 eulerscheZahl: the game knows that no one wants to see a squiddy victory
 struct: No
 struct: It was me 
 struct: I can break the replay on purpouse
 struct:&#160;:)
 struct: I forgot to report it
 struct: cout &lt;&lt; "EXPERT " &lt;&lt; angle &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; thrust &lt;&lt; "&#160;;" &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: The "&#160;;"
 struct: breaks the replay
 struct: Yes this was intentional by me at the time
 eulerscheZahl: illedan fix it
 eulerscheZahl: and disclose the boss code
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: wait, un-disclose
 eulerscheZahl: what's the opposite?
 Astrobytes: hide?
 struct: I wonder if this works in any other multi
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: any other with a broken input parse i'd say
 struct: im surprised it only broke the replay
 vd8ic: kys
 NicolasDiniz: :tacos: SylvJalb

 struct: is antiwonto still sleeping?

 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/3O0aw1V.png">https://i.imgur.com/3O0aw1V.png</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea
 eulerscheZahl: but given the rating that's about as close to 4 as to 5 stars, it might be better that way
 eulerscheZahl: there are contributions of mine (tower dereference) where I understand a poor rating. minesweeper isn't one of these
 struct: yeah the game is a perfect copy
 eulerscheZahl: including all the annoyances (random guessing)
 <b>**darkhorse64 whispers: make an optim out of it</b>
 struct: euler is retired now
 eulerscheZahl: how should that look like? solve as many boards as you can in 600 frames?
 eulerscheZahl: when you solve one (or fail), it restarts with a fresh board
 struct: Multiple boards at once and with restarts
 eulerscheZahl: and you play on all simultaneously?
 darkhorse64: solve 50 boards: for each board, your score is the number of revealed cells + the number of correctly guessed mines + bonus if you solved the leve
 struct: yes
 darkhorse64: level
 struct: darkhorse I havent forgotten ataxx
 struct: Im just doing onitama atm
 eulerscheZahl: i'm just not sure if there's enough room for an optim
 struct: Should take me a few more days
 darkhorse64: I have not even started a bot for it: do not worry
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's not that hard to get near perfect play, random has a stronger effect than your algo
 struct: I dont think it would be enough for an optim
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder had a minesweeper optim a while ago
 eulerscheZahl: instead of giving mine count for direct neighbors, they used a larger range around the cell
 darkhorse64: Depending on your algo, you can strongly increase your success rate
 eulerscheZahl: but they also do 2k validators for a stable ranking at the end
 struct: whats a good success 20% of submits pass?
 eulerscheZahl: of course i can increase the success rate. but at some point it's as good as it can get. and i think that point isn't that hard to reach
 eulerscheZahl: when i made it, i ran it 10 times and passed half of them
 eulerscheZahl: didn't bother doing more runs
 eulerscheZahl: and my solver can be improved
 darkhorse64: My last try was 40% on 50 runs
 struct: wow
 darkhorse64: I can also see clearly that you fail later on average when you improve your bot
 eulerscheZahl: for an optim you would still need an extra twist or you get another TSP-like game
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr, also using concorde for that score?
 darkhorse64: Yeah, I finally gave it a one star despite approving it :sob:
 eulerscheZahl: won't do much, far above the limit of 2.5(?) for garbage collection
 darkhorse64: at least for MS, you have to write your own solver
 struct: MS?
 struct: and minesweepr
 eulerscheZahl: mines sweeper
 struct: ah*
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl no, home made and offline
 darkhorse64: There are still lots of people at 3M score, I hope they downvote it
 eulerscheZahl: oh, well done then
 dbdr: it's unfortunate the scores are rounded
 struct: ill try it with pen and paper
 darkhorse64: dbdr has the DIY spirit
 dbdr: and of course that there are solvers, I agree it should have been modified slightly
 dbdr: did some people admit to using concorde?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure that westicles did. no idea on tric trac
 eulerscheZahl: i used concorde too to achieve my score
 eulerscheZahl: but set 10000 - dist for each edge
 eulerscheZahl: then it was pretty slow as it's not the standard euclidian TSP with heuristics anymore. so i disabled some time costing features
 5DN1L: I wrote a random shuffle code without heuristics to give 1 star
 struct: so on that puzzle I need to submit but on others I dont?
 struct: to rate
 struct: ah I dont
 struct: was just in cache I think
 struct: you only need to press play my code to rate a puzzle
 5DN1L: oh really? i don't know that
 5DN1L: but it's ok to submit that code anyway lol
 eulerscheZahl: it's enough to play in the IDE to vote
 5DN1L: just for giggles
 darkhorse64: 0 1 2 .... 0 solves the puzzle
 Stray-spirit: what do I do when the validators says that I fail but I did everything right in the puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: share the code + puzzle link
 eulerscheZahl: you can paste it right here in the chat
 Stray-spirit: there is a way to share the puzzle + code in the same link?
 dbdr: no
 eulerscheZahl: paste your code directly into the chat
 eulerscheZahl: and paste the URL so we know what you try to solve
 Stray-spirit: ok
 ninjadip: i thought guessing what they were talking about is the fun
 ninjadip: lol

 eulerscheZahl: temperatures
 eulerscheZahl: damn, too slow it typing. but i guessed it
 Stray-spirit: yeah
 Stray-spirit: the test cases give me all right 
 Stray-spirit: but when I submit it only gives me 90%
 dbdr: there is a bug in your code
 Astrobytes: impossible! :P
 eulerscheZahl: but dd you spot where?
 ninjadip: yes
 dbdr: I thought I did, but in fact no. the code is just more complicated that it needs to
 jrke: it fails at 5526 the reason is you have set -273 as LL so for all reasons its abs value is smaller than 5526
 eulerscheZahl: good point
 eulerscheZahl: only large positive and no negative breaks it
 jrke: just change it to some small value &lt; -5526 i mean
 jrke: it will work
 struct: he is right yeah
 eulerscheZahl: change b to some even smaller value (doesn't matter if theoretically impossible)
 struct: custom testcase returns -273 for 5526
 eulerscheZahl: i'm rusty at typing&#160;:(
 dbdr: practice by coding in rust&#160;;)
 Stray-spirit: but first I sepparate positive numbers from negative ones
 eulerscheZahl: nah, busy with Blazor these days
 struct: Stray-spirit the problem is that if the only input is a positive number higher than 273
 struct: it will return -273
 dbdr: what's blazor?
 Stray-spirit: oooo
 struct: C# for web or something like that
 Stray-spirit: I get it now
 dbdr: \o/
 eulerscheZahl: exactly: C# web framework. i'm building a website at work
 Stray-spirit: btw any tip to improve the code?
 TimberStalker: Blazor is the .net framework for web that compiles to WASM
 struct: Stray-spirit you can check others solutions
 eulerscheZahl: except if you use server-side blazor
 struct: after you submit with 100%
 dbdr: 201,385&#160;:)
 TimberStalker: Im just differentiating for ASP.Net
 TimberStalker: from*
 Stray-spirit: good to know, I will do that now thx
 eulerscheZahl: hooray, a new leader
 Astrobytes: on..?

 Astrobytes: oh.. that
 jrke: why the nodes count are too low in that?
 jrke: 300 only
 Astrobytes: also hi dbdr, been a while
 Astrobytes: same for jrke
 dbdr: why do I feel the dedain even in your writing Astrobytes? :D
 jrke: hey astrobyte
 jrke: s
 Astrobytes: jrke: read the forum post&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: dbdr: lol, was I that obvious? :D
 dbdr: yep :D
 eulerscheZahl: neither me nor the dictionary know "dedain". but i missed you too
 Astrobytes: *disdain
 dbdr: disdain
 eulerscheZahl: i ever wrote to your company email address, not sure if you saw it
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl check your french dictionary&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: even*
 dbdr: I saw that on discord :D
 dbdr: but not reading that email
 jrke: wow for TSP source code is also downloadable (cherry on the cake)
 dbdr: it's always good to have referee code
 Astrobytes: It is what it is, since the author didn't want to modify his idea it will stay as it is.I was tempted to create the variant we suggested but I lost motivation fairly quickly.
 Astrobytes: afk 5 minutes
 dbdr: definitely would have been better&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/AlRtHu7.png">https://i.imgur.com/AlRtHu7.png</a>(did it in the contribution so it won't show up on the leaderboard)
 dbdr: yeah, I'm looking for the last solution to get that score&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i might even be in on creating that variant if you manage to motivate me
 eulerscheZahl: did you know that this score is possible?
 dbdr: yes, I ran the online concorde to see what scores it gets, I just don't use the solutions
 eulerscheZahl: i have the offline version since <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/oneofus/">http://www.hacker.org/oneofus/</a>
 ABD_RRAHIM00: i m bad programmer :frowning2:
 dbdr: when concorde says Optimal Solution, it seems to imply it proved optimality, right?
 eulerscheZahl: proven optimal for integers
 eulerscheZahl: it floors or rounds the distances before solving
 dbdr: yes, and it has maximum edge length too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that's why I *100'ed everything
 dbdr: *100 fails for the first one I think
 eulerscheZahl: i also figured that max edge length&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: aah, that's why i didn't get anything out of the 5 nodes
 eulerscheZahl: but that was easy enough to solve
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: * 10 works
 dbdr: got it! \o/
 struct: o.o
 struct: dbdr comes here for a day and takes 1st on everything
 dbdr: just the one thing

 ArcadeRaider: i am stuggling with this Mars Lander one. I'm new to programming and I've been learning C++
 ninjadip: loved that mars lander
 struct: episode 1?
 ArcadeRaider: yup
 ninjadip: especially when the gas is a bigger factor
 ninjadip: or fuel
 struct: have you tried the hints on the left side?
 struct: they will spoil the solution
 ninjadip: what is your mars lander doing wrong that you need to fix?
 ArcadeRaider: it was going to fast, and the hint helps
 ninjadip: have logic that evaluates the horiz and vert momentum
 FreezeFlare: been so long
 Pollard_Rho_Algorithm: codingame
 ninjadip: i had a sweet-spot buffer of velocity that i would neither steer towards or counter steer
 struct: your mars landers is heuristic based ninjadip?
 ninjadip: but maybe have something if horiz_velocity&lt; threshold then increase velocity towards target, if too fast then counter steer, but don't have it flip flop between the two, have a good coast range in the middle
 ninjadip: yes
 ninjadip: hopefully that makes sense
 ninjadip: if too slow and so far from landing zone, increase speed and angle, if too fast counter steer with thrust to slow until desired momentum is reached
 ninjadip: how did u solve it struct
 struct: I didnt
 struct: Never tried it
 ninjadip: ah
 ninjadip: lol
 struct: I dont enjoy puzzles that much
 ninjadip: i never read any of the hints or forums
 ninjadip: so idk how everyone else did it
 ninjadip: i love them
 ninjadip: probably why i like zelda so much
 ninjadip: been investing time again in botw
 struct: botw?
 struct: ah breath of the wild
 struct: or w/e its called
 ninjadip: solving the mars lander with fuel optimization is fun and scary to watch as none of the landings are perfect but everyone survives lol
 Idk.-_-: hi everyone
 ninjadip: yes breath of the wild, botw
 struct: hi
 Idk.-_-: can some one look at this code and say what is wrong&#160;?
 Idk.-_-: print(row[z.index(a)*l:z.index(a)*h],end="")
 ninjadip: idk

 Idk.-_-: ascii art puzzle
 5DN1L: why *l and *h
 Idk.-_-: 4*4 = 16 4*5 = 20 row[16:20]
 Idk.-_-: 4 is E index number
 Idk.-_-: abcde01234
 5DN1L: is h always l + 1?
 5DN1L: l is width and h is height
 Idk.-_-: no
 Idk.-_-: :D
 5DN1L: don't know why how you can mix them that way :shrug:
 5DN1L: why and* how
 Idk.-_-: is whole code wrong&#160;?
 5DN1L: do you feel happier if i said it's partially correct? :upside_down:
 Idk.-_-: 100%
 Idk.-_-: i'm thinking for this code whole day :D
 5DN1L: and you still have to deal with the cases of lowercase letters and symbols
 Ninjatron: is there a path for a total noob to follow?
 ninjadip: the path of the ninja
 ninjadip: is it is silent, but deadly
 Ninjatron: my cousin asked for a resource and i consider recommending this
 Uljahn: just stop being a noob [solved]
 5DN1L: agreed
 Ninjatron: oh i forgot that most engineers don't have a good sense of humor, thanks for reminding me that guys
 Ninjatron: :D
 ninjadip: is noob&gt;boob?
 eulerscheZahl: in lexicographic sorting: yes
 struct: euler you must add card dlc to onitama
 eulerscheZahl: with loot boxes?
 Ninjatron: but damn i asked a serious question
 Ninjatron: :D
 struct: dont forget nfts
 eulerscheZahl: NFTs are total nonsense. you don't even own the object, just a link to it
 struct: shhh
 eulerscheZahl: CG is probably not the best place for a total beginner
 eulerscheZahl: others recommend a different site but i keep forgetting the name
 struct: code academy?
 eulerscheZahl: some mix-up of code and academy, yes
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know whether it's good or not. when i got into coding, i neither had a stable internet nor that fluency in English
 Ninjatron: it was pro anyway i recommended learnpythonorg
 Ninjatron: NFTs are total nonsense you say
 Ninjatron: I said the same thing about crypto coins
 struct: that means you are wrong twice
 Ninjatron: see you must be reasonably intelligent guy if that's your argument
 eulerscheZahl: they still have a purpose at least
 eulerscheZahl: for NFTs i can't see any
 Ninjatron: reasonably intelligent guys generally do not know how many idiots are there out in the wild
 Ninjatron: so we are wrong again and again
 Ninjatron: you could say the exact same thing for NFTs
 Ninjatron: it is a store of value
 Ninjatron: it doesn't have an intrinsic value
 struct: avx?
 struct: maybe I can make some avx nfts
 Ninjatron: so, almost a millenia ago, a Mongolian ruler wanted to use paper money 
 Ninjatron: he was able to get away with a lot of oppressive policies, in Middle East
 Ninjatron: but even him could not make people accept using paper instead of gold or silver
 Ninjatron: yet people use it every day today and no one questions "wait a minute why do i value a piece of paper"
 Ninjatron: so he had to drop paper currency idea
 jacek: avx in onitama?
 struct: ofc jacek 8x games at once
 struct: Ninjatron I think the main problem is that its a new thing and there is a lot of shady stuff already
 struct: jacek do you rely on auto vectorization for your NNs?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: im too dumb to vectorize myself
 jacek: probably could get some tiny speed using int16 and int8
 struct: its simpler than it looks
 Ninjatron: my point is; do not always rely on your intelligence to figure something
 Ninjatron: sometimes just observing idiots is a better signal for where the future is headed
 Ninjatron: :D
 Ninjatron: it took me a long time to realize this
 struct: I see your point
 Idk.-_-: stucked with this puzzle
 5DN1L: get on with the next one then
 Idk.-_-: should i use if statements&#160;?
 5DN1L: yes
 struct: depends on what you are doing
 struct: I try to avoid them
 Idk.-_-: for example if abcdef not in wordadd&#160;?
 5DN1L: yes
 jacek: use only gotos [solved]

 ninjadip: bored, workin on the coin prob
 ninjadip: or by how hungry someone is
 Wontonimo: i got bored of it and wandered off
 Wontonimo: tried to do it in javascript and got frustrated with 2d arrays in js.
 ninjadip: thought you would like the constraint part
 Wontonimo: yeah, i do!
 Uljahn: 2D arrays in coin puzzle?
 Wontonimo: yeah, it is a matrix reduction.  one axis is odd, the other even, 
 Wontonimo: and you are resolving to identity
 ninjadip: oh idk
 ninjadip: that sounds familiar
 Uljahn: hmm, guess i'll do it with numpy
 Durkin: Shoot, okay, really dumb question: If I accidentally had code open on 2 different computers, then wrote on compA and closed it down without 'testing in arena', is there any way to get the code back? Wasn't much, but I came back to compB and just overrode the changes when its page auto-refreshed.
 Wontonimo: yeah, numpy would be easy
 Wontonimo: it is in your history.  open the ide
 Wontonimo: on the left hand side there is a "history"
 Wontonimo: click that, and you'll see all the code you "send to arena"
 Durkin: Ah, only hit "Play my Code". Damn, oh well.
 Wontonimo: how were you approaching the puzzle Uljahn&#160;?
 Uljahn: i was thinking on how to utilize numpy
 Uljahn: so basically no progress so far
 Wontonimo: i have't solved it either, so don't take the 2d matrix thing as gospel 
 darkhorse64: guys, take it easy. Just implement the statement algorithm and you are done
 ninjadip: i'm doing constraints
 ninjadip: seems like it should work
 darkhorse64: it does
 ninjadip: darkhorse64 i know, but they don't
 Wontonimo: what's the statement algorithm?
 darkhorse64: in the three coins example
 Idk.-_-: how  can i use condition if all of them is in for loop&#160;? 
 jacek: take example inputs and outputs, create NN, learn on those,&#160;???, profit

 IllusionSquid: If you do UTTT with MCTS how many visits on your 2nd move?
 struct: depends
 struct: I get 100k
 struct: some people get more
 IllusionSquid: 100k visits on your root?
 IllusionSquid: What????
 IllusionSquid: I struggled to get 3.9k
 IllusionSquid: Alright
 struct: language?
 IllusionSquid: But I did use C# so that is a bottle neck
 Wontonimo: that shouldn't be a bottleneck by any means
 struct: do you use bitboards?
 struct: Do you allocate a memory pool for your nodes at the first turn?
 IllusionSquid: Yeah I did use bitboards this time around
 IllusionSquid: Yeah I was planning on doing a factory model
 IllusionSquid: Not yet
 Wontonimo: not really needed.  you should be able to get to 20k without factory
 Wontonimo: or memory allocation pool
 Wontonimo: have you done a profile of your code?
 struct: also I rollout all the created nodes when I expand
 struct: that also has an impact
 IllusionSquid: There is some room for optimization I am aware... But I'll probably rewrite everything in C++ next try.
 Wontonimo: nope, it's probably your code, not c#
 Wontonimo: are you familiar with branchless programming?
 IllusionSquid: Yeah I think you were the one who recomended it to me a month ago
 Wontonimo: and data oriented programming
 IllusionSquid: Yup
 Wontonimo: at 4k nodes, you have some large inefficiencies that can be addressed.  It isn't c#
 struct: There is plenty of tricks to make it faster
 struct: you can check early win during rollout
 struct: and stuff like that
 struct: but that is not needed yet
 Wontonimo: in another persons code i reviewed, they converted the coordinates at every function call instead of first converting the coordinates when erceived from the game
 Wontonimo: stuff like that
 IllusionSquid: Hmmm perhaps you could look at my code?
 IllusionSquid: But that's besideds the visitcount

 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 Wontonimo: hiya
 UZUHAMA: Lately been lazy on coding&#160;:(
 UZUHAMA: gotta get back on track
 Wontonimo: story of last year for me
 UZUHAMA: ok
 UZUHAMA: Briefly, I got COVID, started studying C programming, learned few new stuff for programming, aced school exam
 Wontonimo: nice
 UZUHAMA: not bad, I guess
 Wontonimo: about the acing exam.  not the covid thing
 UZUHAMA: Well, it's like getting a really strong vaccine
 Wontonimo: i've not got it.  yeah
 UZUHAMA: That's still good too
 Wontonimo: no it isn't.  it's like getting a virus that does long term damage
 UZUHAMA: long term?
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 UZUHAMA: I was sick for only a few days
 UZUHAMA: Oh I know
 UZUHAMA: Some people do get a long term effects from covid
 UZUHAMA: I guess I'm lucky
 UZUHAMA: :sunglasses:
 Wontonimo: okay, so, if you get lots of little paper cuts or injection sites on one arm.  like tons.  you'll get scars on that arm.  the skin won't completely heal back properly
 UZUHAMA: that's true
 UZUHAMA: But your skin do gets little bit more tough
 Wontonimo: well, viruses reproduce by killing cells and using them to make themselves, and in COVIDs case that is the small sacks in your lungs
 Wontonimo: you really think your lungs grow back 100% but your skin doesn't?
 Wontonimo: no, there is scar tissue and inappropriate fusing of tissue
 Wontonimo: damage is damage
 UZUHAMA: oh dang
 UZUHAMA: gotta be more careful from now on, I guess
 UZUHAMA: By the way
 Wontonimo: where as the vaccine makes you feel sick because your body is preparing for a battle, not because there is one.  no bad long tterm side effect there
 Wontonimo: by the way?
 UZUHAMA: um
 UZUHAMA: I was going to say 
 UZUHAMA: Can anyone please do a little check on my  code real quick
 Wontonimo: code for what?
 UZUHAMA: MIME Type
 UZUHAMA: I have no idea why it isn't working

 UZUHAMA: It's Java
 UZUHAMA: Oh I forgot to mention the problem
 UZUHAMA: if(key == extension)
 UZUHAMA: I don't know why
 Wontonimo: what is this for?
 Wontonimo: in java you have to use the equals
 Wontonimo: like so
 Wontonimo: if(key.equals(extension)) {
 Qwick: did you create a dict for the names or array
 UZUHAMA: ...huh
 UZUHAMA: Is it some weird hash table stuff
 UZUHAMA: oh hell nah...
 Wontonimo: the == in java means "is it exactly the same object reference"
 UZUHAMA: what??
 UZUHAMA: I thought that was ===
 UZUHAMA: was it from C or something
 UZUHAMA: I'm confused
 BibiBobo: Why video isn't working?
 Wontonimo: refresh you page BibiBobo
 UZUHAMA: Thank you
 Wontonimo: np.  2 bitcoin please
 UZUHAMA: I would've never find that out on my own
 UZUHAMA: lol
 Qwick: never
 Qwick: me either
 Wontonimo: When you grow up and become a god of programming like me, then you'll make that same mistake, spend 2 days on it, then someone will ask you about it the next day and you'll look smart, just like i did
 UZUHAMA: oh hahaha
 Wontonimo: no, seriously, i knew to look for it because someone i worked with broke something in production 2 days ago with exactly the same error
 UZUHAMA: Oh really?
 UZUHAMA: one day...
 UZUHAMA: I hope it'll come soon
 Wontonimo: worked&#160;?  i mean i currently work with them.  they didn't get fired
 UZUHAMA: hmm?

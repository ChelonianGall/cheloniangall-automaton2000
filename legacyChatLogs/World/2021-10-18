 DaNinja: Ctrl+F5 to refresh just gives a grey screen
 DaNinja: a lot of ERR_ABORTED 504 errors in browser console
 TheBlueBias: What a shame! Errors have the right to live!
 struct: seems fine to me DaNinja
 Uljahn: yes, some ppl from Korea got the same problem, it's been reported on discord bug-report channel, so devs are aware of it
 Uljahn: ah, it was codingame channel, not bug-report
 DaNinja: thanks, similar reports in JP channel too
 Uljahn: could be regional ISP problem
 DaNinja: odd that chat still works
 Uljahn: not really, chat is websocket based, and the problem might be CDN related, but it's just a guess
 Boruto-kun: hi guys, have you watched the new episode of Boruto Next Generation Yesterday???

 eulerscheZahl: Cofferfield, the coffee wizard
 Astrobytes: lol
 TheBlueBias: ngl
 Scarfield: sounds like an undertaker(?), coffers for all
 Astrobytes: that would be coffins
 2ReGul4r: Hey I made my first CoC challenge some days ago. Can you guys give me some more feedback&#160;? :D <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/74472b771e77ff932c9453793178e3c70c5e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/74472b771e77ff932c9453793178e3c70c5e</a>
 TheBlueBias: Coffee lead to coffin.
 Astrobytes: coffers seems more financial
 Scarfield: yea, but with the right dialect, ah its a stretch
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: i'm wondering if your proposed solution is deterministic 2ReGul4r
 eulerscheZahl: you are using a dictionary. does Python keep the keys is order?
 TheBlueBias: Is that the first problem you see?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, do you have more?
 eulerscheZahl: i mean, obviously the first problem is that it's a clash
 Astrobytes: #1: It's a CoC
 eulerscheZahl: but that's too obvious, doesn't count
 Astrobytes: damn you 
 TheBlueBias: #2 alreday seen
 eulerscheZahl: #1 asking on chat?
 TheBlueBias: But not a proble according to guidelines
 TheBlueBias: That's a problem too. But I was speaking of the coc itself
 TheBlueBias: #3 the statement
 eulerscheZahl: "programm" has a typo obviously
 TheBlueBias: The whole sentence is weird
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i skilled the statement and had a look at the code directly
 TheBlueBias: skilled ^^
 Astrobytes: for me to notice anything about it I would have to look at it. Which I will not :innocent:
 eulerscheZahl: just ran the author code on the problem, seems to work
 2ReGul4r: I know my english is not the best its my 3rd language sry :D
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, TheBlueBias is always picky
 Astrobytes: and I seldom look at clashes (it's nothing personal)
 eulerscheZahl: ++
 eulerscheZahl: i just click at them to make the red circle go away
 TheBlueBias: I looked only because it attacked the chat.
 2ReGul4r: I updated the statement with the "programm" typo and changed it up a bit
 2ReGul4r: thanks for the feedback guys
 2ReGul4r: &lt;3
 Scarfield: was Schrödinger buried in a coffin?
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Makos: YES
 Makos: and no
 TheBlueBias: Meh. That's not funny
 TheBlueBias: Disapointing Scarfail
 <b>**Astrobytes awaits the best joke ever from Blaise</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: Meh. Not even a joke.Disappointing Blaise.
 Scarfield: oof
 TheBlueBias: What a lame argument. Dispointing too Astrobytes...
 Astrobytes: :P
 TheBlueBias: You should do politic.
 Astrobytes: I couldn't. I'm awful at lying.
 TheBlueBias: "Do you have a solution to the problems of this country? No? So you don't have the right to criticize anything I do."
 Scarfield: You could get far by answering your own questions, and not the ones you are asked
 Astrobytes: Fair. Though I'm not rich enough either.
 Scarfield: thats where corruption is usefull

 TheBlueBias: Ach so.
 Astrobytes: hahaha

 MeBen: Sometimes I get so stuck on a clever golfing solution in clash that I end up running out of time with less than 100%, when I could have gone with a straight forward solution and win at 100% about 2 minutes in
 eulerscheZahl: can't happen to me B)
 derjack: hm?
 _NikJ: I see an increase in code golfed solutions of the type "爽牥慤汩湥੦㵸㴾砮獵扳瑲⠰ⰲ⤪㘰ⴠ⵸⹳畢獴爨㌬㈩੄㵲⡁㵦⡲⡎㵦⡲⠩⤩⤩੩昨举䄩中㴱㐴《灲楮琨䐾䄭丿≌䅔䔢㨢佋∩"? Anyone cares to explain what it is?

 _NikJ: Booooring
 struct: use ruby and you wont have problems beating python
 waschak: this is so unfair tbh especially when we have to write less code
 _NikJ: I try to use it when possible, I was just curious aboout this
 waschak: c ++ or java vs python ruby
 waschak: xdddd
 derjack: dont bring knife to a gun fight
 struct: its so unfair for python that it gets destroyed in performance multis by c++

 eulerscheZahl: feel free to learn python too
 eulerscheZahl: others learnt C++ just for the bot programming section of this website

 MeBen: Imagine once he sees some Ruby/Perl/Bash golf
 bdrnglm: @eulerschZahl why C++ in particular&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: because it's fast. You could also use C or Rust
 eulerscheZahl: I go with C# as a good tradeoff between speed and ease to code (and because it's what I know best)
 niluthebear: hello world
 Wontonimo: hello niluthebear 
 Wontonimo: hey bdrnglm, I tried for months to do the bot programming in just python.  It went okay but only for bots where simulation didn't really count
 Wontonimo: I tried python on ultimate tic tac toe and was only able to do about 500 (partial) simulations per turn.  With C++ I'm about to do about 100,000 simulations per turn
 Uljahn: i wish we had numba&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: bdrnglm, when you are doing something like minimax or mcts, more simulations really helps.
 Wontonimo: +1 Uljahn 
 bdrnglm: (Guys, please let me know how you can mention somebody here&#160;?)
 bdrnglm: @Wontonimo If I do this it won't work non&#160;?
 bdrnglm: And thank you for letting me know&#160;:) I knew that compiled languages are usualy faster, but for whatever reason I didn't know it was the case on CG as well
 Wontonimo: yeah, just start typing the name then press tab for auto complete.  no need for the "@"
 bdrnglm: Wontonimo ooooooooh hhh
 Wontonimo: yes, that worked.  i see that message in red
 bdrnglm: But you have to know that! There's no UI element letting me know that I can do that
 bdrnglm: Thank you Wontonimo
 bdrnglm:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: you're welcome bdrnglm
 miszu: why the puzzle of the week is a bot programing?
 Wontonimo: sometimes it is
 miszu: what is considered as "you solved the puzzle"
 Wontonimo: a little while ago it was space shooter
 Wontonimo: there is a double rainbow in the background of dice-duel.  Nice eulerscheZahl
 Westicles: miszu wood 1
 miszu: I am doing the bender episode 1 puzzle. Only thing I need to think of is how to detect a loop
 69razer69: whats that new unknown level that appears in language box
 miszu: there is the cheezy way to count # of turns and use a high value but I prefer a clean way to find a loop
 Wontonimo: same location, same state = loop
 miszu: it's not entirely true though
 Wontonimo: why not
 miszu: you could pass the same location, same state but in future moves there is a difference
 Wontonimo: then the state isn't the same
 Wontonimo: how could the state be the same but have a different outcome?
 jacek: quantum physics question?
 miszu: classical physicas
 miszu: maybe later in further location there was a change
 miszu: are you 101% sure that if any location it has the same state then it's a loop?
 Wontonimo: if the state includes bender and the board, and all their properties, then if you have revisited a state then you are definitely in a loop
 miszu: oh okay makes sense
 miszu: you compare more stuff than just location
 Westicles: better check the Hamiltonian to be sure
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: i'm checking my solution to be sure i'm not just leading you in the wrong direction and it turns out that's not how i detect
 Wontonimo: my solution is cheese and I'm not proud of it
 jacek: cheese? and taco?
 Wontonimo: unfortunately no taco
 Wontonimo: and stinky cheese (that isn't supposed to be stinky)
 Wontonimo: I had a "seen" map to help with tracking cycles but I ended up not using it
 niluthebear: any feeling that something(whle typing)  slow while solving puzzle of the week
 niluthebear:&#160;?
 jacek: dice duel mines crypto
 PoonJolly: i have no idea what im doing
 Westicles: disable HW acceleration
 Westicles: er, enable... read the forum
 niluthebear: ok
 Mo-Mo: what if you don't the answers for clash of code

 Mo-Mo: I'm a decent JavaScript developer but these question lol. I don't even know half of them
 Wontonimo: if you want more time Mo-Mo try the puzzles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Wontonimo: the is no time limit on them and you can choose the difficulty
 Wontonimo: you may also like to see your code battle other code.  i Just recently tried Ghost in the cell <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ghost-in-the-cell</a> it was fun
 MSmits: testing my new c4 bot with TT. It doesn't have a book so doesn't beat my old bot, but look how soon it solves:

 MSmits: not yet reusing the tree either, still bugged somehow.
 jacek: i know this trick
 jacek: if (rounds &gt;= 29) cout &lt;&lt; " LOSS" &lt;&lt; endl;
 MSmits: haha I am not you jacek :grin:
 MSmits: solving just 5 plies earlier will help a ton when trying to solve this game
 jacek: how do you backpropagate
 MSmits: along the same route as the selection 
 MSmits: and yeah using TT messes up mcts stats
 MSmits: having parents with less visits than the total number of visits of the children
 jacek: children dont visit their parents nowadays anyway
 eulerscheZahl: you should play the puzzle of the week
 MSmits: indeed, thats the right analogy
 MSmits: you want me to do the dice thing
 jacek: he doesnt have gpu for that
 MSmits: oh lol it's that heavy 3d thingy
 MSmits: I have a good gpu
 eulerscheZahl: either that or low resolution dice. decisions had to be made
 MSmits: I like the game, it's definitely high on my list, but also got a large work backlog
 eulerscheZahl: just make up grades for your student
 MSmits: hehe i dont grade so much now that i teach CS
 eulerscheZahl: our chancellor candidate did that too
 MSmits: have to grade some artwork created with python, some really good stuff

 MSmits: yeah thats messed up, just admit it got lost and don't do the fraud
 eulerscheZahl: he even made students pass that didn't take the exam
 MSmits: yeah i read
 MSmits: handed in blank paper
 eulerscheZahl: fast reader
 jacek: can i apply there
 MSmits: you can, just send in a blank paper
 MSmits: they'll make up your name
 unthinkable: e
 eulerscheZahl: 2.718281828459045
 MSmits: pi
 TheBlueBias: phi
 MSmits: whats phi?
 eulerscheZahl: golden ration?
 eulerscheZahl: -n
 MSmits: i dunno, i always used phi for angles
 MSmits: like theta
 eulerscheZahl: Ist noch lambda? Ja, aber das phi ist noch rho
 TheBlueBias: Yeag golden ratio
 eulerscheZahl: too bad you won't get the joke, translates poorly&#160;:(
 MSmits: yep, gave it a good try but don't get the joke
 Wontonimo: jokes on you, I can read German.  Problem is I don't understand it.
 eulerscheZahl: I bet you can't read all the German letters. What about ß?
 MSmits: i can read some German depending on the context
 unthinkable: ss
 MSmits: dont bring up ww2
 TheBlueBias: Ach
 MSmits: ach?
 eulerscheZahl: us Germans don't make our stringstream objects ss
 MSmits: that figures
 Wontonimo: My reading skills are probably better than Armin Laschet's
 Wontonimo: regardless if i know ß or not
 MSmits: i think it's mostly your decision making skills that are better
 Wontonimo: and looks
 TheBlueBias: Oh? You write schutzstaffel fully?
 MSmits: debatable but i am partial to the lightning bolt
 Wontonimo: thanks, but I hate to break the bad news.  It doesn't look that good in person
 Wontonimo: it's been photo enhanced 
 MSmits: o&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: it's a bit smaller irl.  kinda self concious about its size and all
 MSmits: a small bolt is better than no bolt
 MSmits: struct, can you tell me when yor bot solved this:

 MSmits: your
 jacek: you can the count dropping 1 frame later
 DAPRO1: Hey guys
 DAPRO1: Do the challenges get harder as you level up?
 DAPRO1: Seems very easy
 MSmits: yeah so he solved at 39 or 40
 MSmits: 2-3 frames later. Not bad
 jacek: clashes are random
 DAPRO1: Anyone knows if it gets harder?
 DAPRO1: Ok thanks
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/space-maze</a>good starting point if you want harder
 TheBlueBias: ezpz
 MSmits: that's a good endpoint if you want harder :P
 jacek: solved by 6%
 eulerscheZahl: already 14 solvers. close to the 20 for PotW
 MSmits: imagine the amount of questions you're going to get when thats potw
 eulerscheZahl: sokoban got some fans in that one week
 eulerscheZahl: not even in an ironic way. some needed more than a week but kept playing it
 MSmits: yeah i think it's great you made that and minesweeper. Nostalgia!
 MSmits: you must have been quite young when those games were popular
 jacek: but space maze was potw hm?
 eulerscheZahl: my sister played sokoban (or a similar game, can't even remember)
 eulerscheZahl: space maze and blockout are my 2 missing ones that haven't been potw yet
 eulerscheZahl: and tower dereference
 eulerscheZahl: no leagues. but also no loss for not being potw
 eulerscheZahl: i consider it the weakest of my contributions
 MSmits: with the best name
 eulerscheZahl: I also like the tryangle catch name
 MSmits: true that's good too
 struct: what jacek said was correct
 struct: when my rollouts drop a lot its when its solved
 struct: So I solved the next turn

 struct: after you play b4a3 its a win
 struct: ah no
 eulerscheZahl: bad defense for sure
 jacek: no, its lose 1 move later
 struct: yeah
 struct: but e8e7 instead of b4a3 would have saved it?

 jacek: yes

 MSmits: bot seems good otherwise
 MSmits: has something to do with me changing from board-on-the-node to move-on-the-node
 Astrobytes: At least it's a book bug and not a book worm
 MSmits: true&#160;:)
 MSmits: was up last night cuz my dog ate a slug
 MSmits: she wasnt feeling very well
 Scarfield: badum tss  :drum:
 MSmits: yeah, shes ok now though
 Scarfield: oh, was not directed at your dog&#160;:(
 MSmits: it was a badum tss moment though
 Astrobytes: ate a slug... doesn't seem too big a deal, is she sensitive like that?
 MSmits: it's a small dog
 MSmits: big slug
 Scarfield: okay that is slightly amusing, even though sad for your doggo
 Astrobytes: Hmm. Is she on regular anti-worm treatments?
 MSmits: yea, should be ok
 struct: "has something to do with me changing from board-on-the-node to move-on-the-node", what does this mean?
 struct: ah you dont store the board anymore?
 struct: on the node?
 Scarfield: ivermectin?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: eh
 Astrobytes: Cause iirc it's lung or heart-worms you need to look out for with slugs
 MSmits: no probably not ivermectin

 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah i know
 Scarfield: updating the board both from the book and the tree maybe
 Astrobytes: cool cool, I trust you as a responsible dog owner&#160;;)

 MSmits: well it's my wife mostly that looks up this stuff
 MSmits: she already had a fear of slugs before she looked that up :P
 Astrobytes: 'dog owner with a responsible wife' then :D
 MSmits: indeed
 Scarfield: im sure the dog is responsible as well
 MSmits: she would not eat slugs if she was
 Astrobytes: It's mental Scarfield, it has small dog syndrome
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: I am actually not sure she ate a slug but the alternative is worse
 Astrobytes: *she
 Astrobytes: What's the alternative?
 MSmits: we had a plastic bird bath with 10 years of accumulated residue from whatever they did in there. Belonged to the previous owner
 MSmits: huge chunks of orange stuff
 MSmits: she may have eaten a chunk of that instead
 Scarfield: me ma has two small dogs, one is mental from small dog syndrome, the other is brain damaged and super nice
 Astrobytes: How did she get it? It was at ground level?
 MSmits: i think it may have fallen off as i was moving the junk out to the other side of the house
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: awww bless!
 MSmits: it was at ground level indeed, it was dug into the ground before i pulled it out
 MSmits: like a tiny pond
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I met a brain damaged cat once, poor thing drooled all the time and couldn't take care of its fur properly, so needed constant brushing. It was a sweet little thing
 MSmits: my dog is psychologically damaged and is also mental from small dog syndrome, not sure where one begins or the other ends
 Astrobytes: @MSmits: Ah I see
 Astrobytes: and lol
 MSmits: i probably told you before but she was a guard dog for 2-3 yrs, lived outside. Probably ate plenty of slugs back then
 Scarfield: small guard dog?
 Astrobytes: Yes. You rescued her right?
 Astrobytes: From Romania or somewhere?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: guard dogs arent just to defend, also to warn, small dogs can do this just fine
 MSmits: also she had sisters, they were a team. Vicious too
 Scarfield: yea sure, i often play-fight with my moms small mental dog, its bloody fast. I wouldnt want to fight it for real, let alone more of them
 MSmits: the problem is that she thinks we are her new team. If we go for a walk she wants to charge any dog she sees and i don't mean to hug and kiss
 Astrobytes: lol, and the stealth cat that follows between the buildings along That Street
 MSmits: ah yeah at my old house we had one of those that was always following. some cats do that, it's unsettling
 Scarfield: how old is your dog?
 MSmits: I think 6 now
 MSmits: at least she no longer attacks me
 Scarfield: probably to late to fix that behavior then
 MSmits: yeah but small progress is good
 MSmits: when she was first with us, she did not wait for positive identification before the attack, so if she just saw my legs...
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: with previously traumatised animals you just kind of have to roll with their behaviour at first, recognise their triggers and work with them
 Scarfield: i remember you mentioning something about opening the fridge with care
 MSmits: she was particularly sensitive about food and where it was stored, so if the legs were poking out behind the refridgerator door...
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol yeah I remember
 Scarfield: poor little buggers, nice of you to "adopt" one&#160;:)
 MSmits: well it was my wife's decision, but I am happy with her, she's funny
 Astrobytes: Pets to me are members of the family
 Scarfield: your wife, or your dog?
 Astrobytes: hahahaha :rofl:
 Scarfield: xD
 niluthebear: :rofl:
 niluthebear: is there any typo in WHAT WILL I LEARN section <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020</a> 
 niluthebear: ressource
 MSmits: lol Scarfield I realized that was ambiguous&#160;:)
 MSmits: and yeah if you don't treat a pet as a member of the family you shouldn;t have one
 Scarfield: ^
 MSmits: niluthebear you can edit the html and then the extra s will be gone&#160;:)
 niluthebear: lol
 Scarfield: i have very well developed skills for misunderstanding stuff :p
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: it's good, teaches other people to be clear in their communications
 Astrobytes: hahaha, I regularly find myself teaching English to people
 Astrobytes: perhaps I missed my calling
 Scarfield: last time i visited my mom, she asked if i wanted another portion of food, and i said: "ill wait 2 sec and get some more" everyone counted to 2 in unison, and i got another portion, its in the family
 Astrobytes: hahahaha that's just a cool family :D
 Scarfield: yea especially when i see my big brother, we literally catch each other in rephrasing senteces to not be misunderstood
 Astrobytes: lol, that's kinda awesome tbh
 jacek: misunderstandings eh
 Scarfield: for sure, its family friendly trolling
 MSmits: I troll my wife all day
 Scarfield: for years my big brothers wife were rolling her eyes at us, now she is taking part and upping the stakes :p
 Astrobytes: hahaha, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em!
 Scarfield: yup xD
 Scarfield: even my 11 year old niece catch us sometimes
 Astrobytes: I have this dynamic with my mother
 Astrobytes: And pretty much all my friends
 Scarfield: i asked her if she could pass me the pepper, and she dead-pan just says yes, not passing me the pebber :D
 Scarfield: pebber/pepper
 jacek: :confused:
 MSmits: sounds like jacek is your mother
 MSmits: he would do that
 MSmits: or maybe blaise 
 Scarfield: ah he would just complain :p
 MSmits: hmm maybe&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: "can you give me a hand with this" - "yes", extends hand
 Astrobytes: etc etc
 Scarfield: i love that kind of dumb humor
 Scarfield: it brings a spark to the sometimes stale everyday 
 MSmits: struct, do you have a mirrored representation for c4?
 MSmits: (8 - (nodes[i].move_index&#160;% 9)) == move_index
 MSmits: the 8 -&#160;?
 struct: no
 struct: my 0 bit is bottom right
 MSmits: hmm maybe this is what i am missing?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: exactly!
 MSmits: oh ok mirrored then
 MSmits: my 0 bit is bottom left
 struct: yours is mirrored :p
 MSmits: but i dont have to do 8 - ...
 Scarfield: bottom left o0
 Scarfield: bottom left as 0 seems so un-intuitive to me
 struct: same for me Scarfield
 struct: but I see some people starting from top left
 Scarfield: heathens
 Astrobytes: I don't think there's really a best way, it's personal preference and/or common practice for most things
 Scarfield: :pitchfork:
 struct: yeah its personal preference for sure
 struct: :fork:
 struct: :fork_and_knife:
 Astrobytes: :flaming torch:
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: btw Astrobytes i found out that my audio book app has the constant gardener with le carre himself as narrator on it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: Now *that* is awesome
 Astrobytes: It surely couldn't be better than that
 Scarfield: its amazing, one thing is that he is a great author, but the man can narrate as well!
 MSmits: constant gardener?
 MSmits: I identify with this man
 Scarfield: yea, lawn mowing is jobby
 Astrobytes: Yes, he spoke very very well
 Astrobytes: jobby!
 MSmits: i remove all the jobbys my dog made before i do the lawn
 Astrobytes: *jobbies
 MSmits: those too
 Scarfield: never seen an interview or anything with him, but after listening to him narrating, i definatly want to
 Astrobytes: For when you have time:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/d-Tq7xeSwRE">https://youtu.be/d-Tq7xeSwRE</a>
 Astrobytes: (2010 interview)
 Scarfield: oh, i didnt even know he past away
 Astrobytes: Yes. Great loss.
 Scarfield: its weird to see him speak now, i connect his voice with the story atm
 Astrobytes: you still will when you listen to it
 Scarfield: i didnt even realise "the spy who came in from the cold" was written by him
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Scarfield: well my to-read list has expanded :p
 Astrobytes: Good! 
 Scarfield: the first 10 minutes of that link.. the gonads of that guy
 Astrobytes: right&#160;:)
 Bushi671: im pretending to be productive in this class
 MSmits: Gj Bushi671
 Bushi671: might as well learn code while im at it
 Bushi671: tyty &lt;3
 MSmits: :thumbsup:
 Bushi671: is this a good site?
 Astrobytes: Bushi671: if you want to be good at things later in life I strongly advise you be productive
 MSmits: if you can't, pretending is also ok in many cases
 Scarfield: anyway, im off for today, gn folks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: (or try at least)
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: gn dude
 niluthebear: gn
 MSmits: gn
 Bushi671: no absolutely I want to study code so I feel now is a better time if any 
 Bushi671: im just in a class with a friend for moral suppory
 Bushi671: support*
 Astrobytes: lol, which subject?
 Bushi671: rn hes were in EDUC but ive already taken this class
 Bushi671: lol
 Bushi671: so I just searched up code lessons and now im here XD
 Astrobytes: I have no idea what that is but carry on coding, pay attention in math class and preferably a at least one science
 Bushi671: good thing I love both those subjects&#160;!
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Bushi671: but thanks for the tip regardless! 
 Astrobytes: Then all I will say is stay with it and go far&#160;:)
 Bushi671: tyty :D
 dimertrean: sup
 Porsuk: that's a nice pfp you've got there
 Porsuk: I like ponies too, not in this way tho
 Remus_: Can I somehow kill the 3d display in this puzzle of the week? it takes ages for me to load&#160;:(

 Astrobytes: * Remus_
 Red_Eclipse: hello
 ipsissimus: Hi friends, is this refactorable into 1 line:t, c, r = [int(i) for i in input().split()]print('yes' if t&gt;=c/r else 'no')
 struct: dont think so
 struct: but doesnt py3 have ternary operator?
 struct: ah its the one you are using
 struct: im not used to py3 syntax sry
 ipsissimus: yeah im pretty sure theres a way but im big dumb. 
 struct: print('no' if t&lt;c/r else 'yes')
 struct: one char shorter :p
 ipsissimus: :O
 MeBen: print('no' if int((x:=input().split())[0])&lt;int(x[1])/int(x[2]) else 'yes')
 struct: also 2 spaces were not needed
 struct: print('no'if t&lt;c/r else'yes')
 MeBen: And could probably do map(int,input().split())
 struct: meben is right
 struct: idk python so cant help much
 ipsissimus: ok hold on i need to look at that a bit colser
 MeBen: It uses the new in 3.8 walrus operator
 ipsissimus: i see. let me google it
 ipsissimus: i always struggle to shorten problems with multiple var assignments. but then i see other users submit some voodoo and im like wat
 ipsissimus: ah i see, walrus evaluates the right side then assigns it instead of needing 2 lines
 MeBen: Very controversial operator, turns assignment from a statement to an expression
 MeBen: Python is hard to voodoo with (unless you count eval('UTF8HERE'))
 MeBen: print('no'if eval('{}&lt;{}/{}'.format(*input().split()))else'yes')
 ipsissimus: ye thats exactly the kind of voodoo im talking about
 ipsissimus: i also see people take the input stream and output something like i(some expression)
 ipsissimus: makes me scratch my head for longer than it took for me to write my own implementation
 Wontonimo: +100 MeBen :tada:
 struct: this is the type of code i write in coding interviews
 Wontonimo: how's unemployment treating you?
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: j/k
 ipsissimus: i lost my job 3 weeks ago.. thats why im here&#160;:*(
 Abruuham: BOOM ROASTED
 Wontonimo: oh no, sorry to hear ipsissimus
 mjuresic: you were bad then, keep practicing
 struct: Wontonimo i dont think the language ceritifications are bugged
 struct: Have you checked the tests you have to do?
 Wontonimo: were you a programmer, or are you changing careers ipsissimus?
 Wontonimo: no, i'm not doing the certification tests.  Why, are they pretty straight forward, like clash level?
 ipsissimus: Im actually EE but spent most my time doing GUI work for data collection as well hardware fabrication for sensors that would capture the data.
 struct: yes clash level
 struct: took me 10 minutes for 3 puzzles I think
 struct: and I used c++
 Wontonimo: EE?  Electrical Engineer?
 ipsissimus: thats right. I worked for a computer vision company. Had to collect data like. human hand images, eyes, and large scale mapping stuff. 
 ipsissimus: but most job interviews want me to be a god at python which is hard because i spent alot of my time learning ML and CV applications like camera calib etc
 mjuresic: do you have your projects to show from ML&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that's nice to hear struct, i just may give it a go
 Wontonimo: yeah, the job interview really is biased towards those who can code as a performance art, and not really those who can do long thinking
 ipsissimus: I have some of the GUI work that I ported before i was let go. but technically everything i worked on doesnt belong to me so I cant show it off like as if it were. I didnt write any NN or learning algos, just the protocols to capture training dat
 Wontonimo: hey, that's good stuff
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/KingDDD/Gestures-Detection-Collector-Tool/blob/main/gestures-master/data-collection/scripts/GUI.py">https://github.com/KingDDD/Gestures-Detection-Collector-Tool/blob/main/gestures-master/data-collection/scripts/GUI.py</a>
 Wontonimo: I do NN and ML at where I work
 mjuresic: no it is not, dont give him false hope
 ipsissimus: Looking back on it, its jank but its what i got.
 mjuresic: be realistic, you need your project to show and talk about to prove you know ML, or be ready to do some live coding to showcase your skills
 mjuresic: Change point of view, you need to show your skills somehow, adapt to what you need to know to pass interview
 Wontonimo: I've not needed that
 struct: is ML a requirement to pass interviews now?
 struct: im screwed
 mjuresic: no it is not
 mjuresic: but if you want ML related job it could be
 Wontonimo: I've focused on being able to code as a performance art.  I also do a lot of my own mini projects (like stuff that would take a couple days).  I do well
 mjuresic: Wontonimo, somehow you need to show your skills
 ipsissimus: Oh I dont purport on my resume to know how to implement ML from scratch or anything.  I just say that I have fundamental understanding on how to get them to work with viable data.  Bad data in my field results in months of lost time and thousands of lost $$
 Wontonimo: +1 ipsissimus 
 mjuresic: Wontonimo, you obviously focused to be able to show skills
 Wontonimo: that there ipsissimus is good business thinking and a view of the bottom line
 mjuresic: that is what ipsissimus lacks
 Wontonimo: and tbh, 95% of the work isn't ML in the ML field.  It is dealing with data
 mjuresic: 5 days project is good enough to have something to talk about on interview, a lot better then nothing
 ipsissimus: let it be known. i think my python is trash.  but what im looking for is a more multidisciplinary field like rapid prototyping or test engineering.
 ipsissimus: but maybe thats a pipe dream atm
 mjuresic: ipsissimus getting better at python does not takes a lot of time
 ipsissimus: im working on it :p
 struct: Yeah I would probably work on a project to show it
 mjuresic: Cool! Make something simple stupid like few days project too
 Wontonimo: but also work on being able to do easy clash of code puzzles *without* googling anything
 mjuresic: fizzbuzz like&#160;:) 
 Wontonimo: yes
 ipsissimus: yeah code clashes seem simple to me
 ipsissimus: interview questions have been far more difficult imo
 mjuresic: in few weeks time you can be great
 Wontonimo: oh, like what questions&#160;?
 ipsissimus: i think the last one that stumped me was minimum number of train platforms given arrivals and departures
 ipsissimus: with 20 minute window for trains to "hover" beforeneedig a platform
 mjuresic: One of my fav question is "implement cache"&#160;:) 
 struct: cache like memoization?
 mjuresic: yeah
 Wontonimo: $$$ &lt;- done
 mjuresic: up to you what will you use behind, but fun to discuss what and why
 struct: I guess that should apply to dp related problems
 ipsissimus: me?
 mjuresic: it is easier than that
 mjuresic: linked list and hashmap and some basic implementations works the best, but there are many solutions that works well
 struct: ipsissimus I feel like clashes are a bit too simple
 ipsissimus: i think so too, but not sure where to go other leetcode for the harder ones
 mjuresic: it is actually enough to solve it and explain it well enough
 struct: cf, atcoder
 mjuresic: I practiced on hackerrank but that was few years ago
 struct: but problems are way harder there
 struct: imo
 Wontonimo: ipsissimus, the people conducting the interview are just winging it also.  They ask some esoteric question and some people have read about it and some havent
 Wontonimo: a lot of time it is just luck of the draw if you've heard that one question
 Wontonimo: the trick is to go to more interviews
 mjuresic: true, luck is important&#160;:( unfortunatelly
 mjuresic: the trick is to go to more interviews &lt;-- most important advice! kudos
 ipsissimus: exactly how i feel about it. I worked at a AR/VR company called Magic Leap for 4 years. interview question asked me for some dfs of binary tree. never used a binary tree since
 mjuresic: Cracking the code interview books is awesome
 MeBen: I just won a Clash with 0%
 mjuresic: dfs is basics, dont be affraid of it
 Wontonimo: my 'rule of thumb' when job hunting is 100 warm contacts turns into 10 interviews, which I do at least one person followup email or hand written letter, turns into 1 or 2 offers.
 mjuresic: Wontonimo great advices :ok_hand:
 ipsissimus: oh i passed that interview (because idid binary tree cramming) what i mean is that after that interview, I never saw a tree since. makes me wonder why that was the interview since it was irrelevant to the job
 Wontonimo: unless my friend hires me, then I'm just in.  Like my current job and the one before that
 mjuresic: yeah many wonder the same questions
 ipsissimus: yea i sent out about 35 applications today
 Wontonimo: ah, that's very different than a warm contact imho
 mjuresic: I didnt used trees 4 years hahaha
 ipsissimus: looking at FB reality labs as its technically the same job as the one I had
 Westicles: this is the easiest time in history to get a job in the US
 Wontonimo: oh cool
 ipsissimus: sensor calibration and SLAM and the like
 ipsissimus: well that makes me feel worse lmao
 mjuresic: ipsissimus try Microsoft too, they have same stuff
 ipsissimus: yeah tomorrow is microsoft and apple
 Wontonimo: I thought 1999 was pretty easy to get a job.  And again in 2000.5
 ipsissimus: then wednesday will be nvidia and amazon
 Wontonimo: not so much 2002
 mjuresic: if you have experience is easy
 ipsissimus: hopefully my friend
 mjuresic: good luck ipsissimus and others, time for me to go to sleep
 ipsissimus: when i got terminated, all my responsibilities hit me like a ton of bricks
 Wontonimo: sorry to hear
 Wontonimo: i hope you have a good social support network of friends and family
 ipsissimus: not really, im alone. but what can you do? I can only look forward and try to improve
 ipsissimus: actually
 ipsissimus: I have to, i have no choice
 KelvinAndHubbles: is the programming language certificates ranked both on points and time?
 struct: I think so KelvinAndHubbles
 struct: and dificulty of the problem
 slazure: hi
 struct: When I did mine I got
 struct: 97, 300, 300
 struct: I think the max for the first one was 100
 struct: I was kinda slow on that one
 Wontonimo: can you re-do it?
 struct: after 30 days
 Wontonimo: nice
 MeBen: I wish Firefox wouldn't prevent Emacs keys from working properly in the editor
 MeBen: So many Windows opened accidentally
 struct: std seems to have so many functions I was not aware o.o
 MeBen: C++ STL is huge, and actually pretty good (sans the error messages ...)
 MeBen: If you're familiar with it you can write some very clean C++
 struct: yeah, im trying to get into competitive programming
 struct: a lot to learn
 KelvinAndHubbles: what is up with the certificate tests tho. I know like very little to base C++ and just used if statements and got &gt;99% for the ranking. Is it just because their a new feature and it'll balance out?
 struct: no idea how it works
 struct: i also got 99%
 struct: and I feel like the problems are too simple
 struct: I still remember all of them I think
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7485189f3f6bea04d252903b8927bd2921ec?comment=53190">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7485189f3f6bea04d252903b8927bd2921ec?comment=53190</a> try my contribute again pls :D
 struct: string.size() &gt;=3  &amp;&amp; &lt;= 20 &amp;&amp; ^[a-zA-Z0-9]
 struct: oh change it to hex now
 struct: I need to update by solution&#160;:/
 Thorcode: more 
 Thorcode: you need to change all the number to factorial of it :D
 Thorcode: then plus them all and change to hex
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: I had such a beautiful solution&#160;:(
 Thorcode: why flip table struct?
 Thorcode: so you can't solve it with 18 char anymore :D
 Thorcode: I was thinking to change hex to string too :D
 struct: what do you mean?
 Westicles: the numbers are too big for most languages
 Thorcode: change my hex to a string
 KelvinAndHubbles: actually tho, factorial(100) is a bit to compute and store
 Thorcode: ok so I will change it to factorial the last sum :D
 struct: factorial the last sum?
 struct: what does that mean?
 struct: sum all then factorial?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: like the first but factorial it
 Thorcode: then change it to string :D
 KelvinAndHubbles: I feel like thats worse if you sum it first
 struct: already had solution for this one
 Thorcode: ok
 struct: $&gt;&lt;&lt;"0x%x"%`dd`.split.map{|x|(1..x.to_i).inject(?*)||1}.reduce(?+)
 struct: yes its wors
 Thorcode: or easier reduce the number
 struct: if you sum all the number will increase
 KelvinAndHubbles: sum of last test case is 5022 and factorial(5022) is a bit
 Thorcode: sum all and minus 200
 KelvinAndHubbles: thats still 4822 wat
 Thorcode: I will reduce number :D
 struct: just make sure the result is less than
 struct: 2^31-1
 Thorcode: 2^30&#160;?
 KelvinAndHubbles: (2^31)-1
 Thorcode: ok
 struct: if its sum of all then factorial I can reuse my old code
 Thorcode: so the last i will make 2^31 :D
 struct: then it wont work in some languages...
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: the max will be 1000 ok?
 Thorcode: if the sum is bigger print value error
 struct: not how it works sorry
 struct: !1000 is way too big
 Thorcode: ok 500
 Thorcode: or 250
 struct: still too big
 Thorcode: about 50
 struct: still
 ipsissimus: 52! has like 67 0's
 ipsissimus: massive number
 Thorcode: 40
 struct: ...
 ipsissimus: lol
 Thorcode: 20
 struct: still too big
 struct: sorry
 Thorcode: if the sum is bigger than 20 print hex of it
 struct: !12 is the max you can go
 struct: without going over 32 bits
 struct:&#160;:)
 Thorcode: ok
 struct: print hex of what?
 struct: of the factorial?
 struct: or the sum?
 struct: I would probably forget the factorial
 Thorcode: if the number is bigger than 12 print hex of the sum
 Thorcode: else factorial it and print hex of it
 struct: too random imo
 Thorcode: or if the sum is minus print value error
 Thorcode: that seem easier right?
 Wontonimo: a good puzzle is more than just repeating a sequence of pre-defined steps.  It is problem solving and preferably something with a real-world problem
 struct: I would just keep it as it is
 struct: and limit max number to 11
 Thorcode: ok
 struct: even 12 is safe
 Thorcode: 6227020800 is this too big?
 struct: yes
 struct: it has 33 bits
 struct: 12!+12!+11!+10!+9!+8!+7!+6!+5!+4!+3!+2!+1!= 1001957913
 struct: its safe
 Thorcode: oh ok
 struct: Wontonimo I think that is more applicable to puzzles
 Wontonimo: ah, yes.  i agree
 Wontonimo: i thought it was a puzzle, my bad
 Thorcode: that was clash :D
 Westicles: I like to make culture-free clashes.  It is sad all these require a western upbringing to solve
 struct: latvia going into lockdown again o.o
 struct: damn MSmits finished his bot
 struct: its solving so much earlier than mine o.o
 MKSxTERROR: can anybody tell me how to train for coding exam?
 KelvinAndHubbles: by coding
 Wontonimo: not that helpful, but true
 Wontonimo: what is on the coding exam?
 MKSxTERROR: but where to practice
 MKSxTERROR: which site is better
 Wontonimo: what is on the exam MKSxTERROR&#160;?
 Thorcode: what about change from hex to demical&#160;?
 Thorcode: oh forget it
 ipsissimus: i think you can do int(hex, 16)
 struct: yeah
 Westicles: hex was invented by the patriarchy
 struct: or "%x"%var
 ipsissimus: or int(hex, anybase)
 struct: or you can do
 struct: int(hex, first)
 struct: i meant
 struct: int(decimal, first)
 struct: being first the first number you read
 ipsissimus: can you clarify that
 ipsissimus: i dont understand what u mean
 struct: the decimal would be the sum
 Thorcode: yep
 struct: or w/e he wants to do with the inputs
 Thorcode: that why I said forget it
 struct: and the first would be the base using the first number he read
 struct: 212
 ipsissimus: ah i see
 struct: would be int(5, 2)
 Thorcode: make a contribute is not easy as I thought :D
 struct: it is
 struct: pick a board game port it, free contribution
 ipsissimus: yeah but that requires big brain many wrinkle. i dont have big brain.
 ipsissimus: no wrinkle
 ipsissimus: no wrinkle = no think
 ipsissimus: no think = no sad
 Thorcode: I will make a running compition :D
 Thorcode: competition
 Wontonimo: good first try Thorcode.  Keep at it! 
 Thorcode: or the last thing is change it to ascill ode?
 struct: I dont think it adds much
 struct: I feel like the problem is still a bit trivial
 struct: But I dont really do puzzles
 Thorcode: then tell the name of the ascill present?
 Thorcode: that will be tough for me too :D
 struct: what do you mean?
 Thorcode: like the ascill present the beach print beach
 struct: ascii art?
 Thorcode: yep
 struct: im not a fan of it :p
 Thorcode: print what the ascii art present :D
 Thorcode: but this was tough
 struct: where is it?
 Thorcode: I was thinking to make that
 struct: But how will it work?
 Thorcode: like this pic is beach
 struct: yeah I cant code that
 ipsissimus: there was an ascii art CoC i remember
 ipsissimus: where you had to make a face
 ipsissimus: like:
 ipsissimus: ^^^^^
 ipsissimus: | 0  0 |
 ipsissimus: \ v /
 ipsissimus: or something like that
 Thorcode: make that is not easy as I think
 ipsissimus: i thought it was about middling difficulty
 Thorcode: why I could say that it is imposible
 Thorcode: the middle is |  -  |
 struct: maybe you can give a beach and make the people counter the number of tents or something
 Thorcode: and the nose too bro
 struct: idk
 Thorcode: no I can't do that either
 Thorcode: look at that strange tree how to identify it?
 struct: match(/\/\/o\\/)
 Thorcode: what
 Wontonimo: procedurally generated ascii art vs. ascii art object recognition.  Sounds like a cooperative multi
 struct: regex
 bminnix: Yeah, I just finished the 50 clashes needed to access the contribute area.  I don't see me adding much here for a bit.
 Wontonimo: have you tried the bot battles bminnix&#160;?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Thorcode: I tried to Identify the ascill and I failed
 bminnix: I've done a couple of them.  My Coders Strike Back is in the 20's of Bronze League.
 bminnix: But I haven't spent much time on it since submitting the code that got me there. 
 bminnix: And I was looking into the Zombies one, but only took the time to make him go to 1 human.  That failed on the one where he gets bombarded early and so does the human, no avoidance yet.  One day I might pick it back up.
 bminnix: Any of the javascripts guys here play screeps?
 bminnix: I guess it can be fun for anyone who codes really, but you write in js
 struct: never tried it
 struct: Mainly due to having to use js
 bminnix: Haha.  Yeah.  It's one reason I don't play it as much as I thought I might.  Spent a lot of time at first, learned a bit of js.  
 bminnix: You have to manage your CPU (amount of time it takes for your loop to run) pretty tight, and being a noob didn't help.  Path caching becomes extremely important.
 bminnix: Overall though, if you take out the js aspect and look at it from a RTS that you fully program your AI, it's a really cool game.

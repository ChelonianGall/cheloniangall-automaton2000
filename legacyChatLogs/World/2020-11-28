 Automaton2000: at the same time for a test case
 jacek: happy Caturday
 PrO_Ogrmr:&#160;:)
 jrke: oh yes happy caturday
 Doju:  How can i profile my code without running it locally?
 Doju: or alternatively how can i get all of the inputs out of a game to run it locally?
 Doju: printing all of it will truncate it

 Uljahn: jacek: could you give some hints on how to compress NN weights to utf8? or is it utf16? im lost
 jacek: utf16
 jacek: i use python to 'compress' and c++ code to 'decompress'
 Uljahn: thanks
 pb4: wut&#160;?
 pb4: You compress/decompress in a different language&#160;?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/492e4c44-b22e-4cbb-adea-164c3f419594">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/492e4c44-b22e-4cbb-adea-164c3f419594</a>
 jacek: pb4 i mean i have NN in my comp, i encode to utf16 in python. then in code on CG i decompress it
 jacek: as for python code

 jacek: not every utf16 character will be only one character
 Westicles: yeah, base2048 addresses this but it is only in JS
 Pierrebr: Hey guys, I passed the test cases but when I submit it fails some of the randomly generated tests. I can't debug at this stage. How to get more info and correct my code&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: which puzzle are you even talking about?
 jrke: you can't get info of validators in any puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: for some you can
 Pierrebr: Pirate's treasure, beginners

 Mr-DillinG: Damn this is more tricky than i thought :P 
 Mr-DillinG: definately a good practice and a good way to learn more&#160;:)
 Doju: this is a shame
 Doju: deepcopying game states takes up like 80% of the available time
 Uljahn: classic, i guess a faster way to copy gamestates in python would be to use structured numpy arrays, you can even preallocate memory for children with np.repeat to make the needed number of copies at once
 Doju: I suppose i have to make my gamestates into simpler objects to make that work
 Doju: currently they're pretty complex
 jacek: do you need to copy gamestate instead of incrementally do/undo game moves?
 Doju: I guess i could do that too, jacek
 Doju: might be a lot faster, in fact...
 wlesavo: deepcopy is a pure evil
 jacek: deeplearning even more
 wlesavo: coming from python i undo mutations in SA instead of copying  state even in cpp code
 Doju: Doesn't that get slower the deeper you go?
 Doju: Since you have to apply all the actions to the original state for each node in the branch
 jacek: dont you copy more as deeper you go as well?
 jacek: or better, measure time and see what is bette
 Doju: well yes, but that's O(1) for each step whereas doing and undoing mutations is O(depth_of_current_node)
 Doju: anyways i'm gonna refactor everything and then think about that
 eulerscheZahl: "Each game tick, first all active entities’ actions are being performed sequentually in random order (the order is different each tick). "&#160;:/
 rockstar555: hii
 MadKnight: no more perfectly predictable games for u
 kovi: well, not different from raic2019
 kovi: and with so many units it would not be possible to plan ahead except for a few turnswith this rule the importance of micromanagement is lowered even more
 struct: managed to create a piece yesterday on blender
 struct: but i think im gonna cancel it, the pieces zoomed out are barely visible
 struct: to see which is which
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/JHWQIWv.gif">https://i.imgur.com/JHWQIWv.gif</a>
 jacek: well the shape is the same
 eulerscheZahl: my Blockout has the problem that some surfaces aren't rendered depending on how you rotate the view
 eulerscheZahl: so there's still a justification to have pixi. still a fun experience to mess with three.js
 eulerscheZahl: after reading the RAIC rules: sounds fun (except that I hate fog), i'll join the contest
 struct: nice euler, did not see that was wip now
 eulerscheZahl: as it's playable now
 eulerscheZahl: except i forgot to mark it as a win after that 200 turns, so you always lose :D
 malik27: bhaduoooo
 malik27: gaanduo
 AntiSquid: you can scale objects to make them bigger struct
 AntiSquid: english malik27
 struct: AntiSquid the quality seems fine in other gltf loaders, just not on threejs
 AntiSquid: i am sure you can speak it well . malik27
 eulerscheZahl: struct then use any other JS library
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">https://www.babylonjs.com/</a>
 struct: ill check, i think i found another game though
 struct: might be a little more interesting since is not studied
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://1stwebdesigner.com/3d-javascript-libraries/">https://1stwebdesigner.com/3d-javascript-libraries/</a>so many options :o
 AntiSquid: i have a huge list of bookmarked JS frameworks / engines / libraries btw :Pnever got around trying them all
 AntiSquid: there's always new JS stuff popping out of nowhere
 eulerscheZahl: i've only done a little 3D charting with plotly so far
 AntiSquid: struct look up <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">https://brm.io/matter-js/</a>   matter js,  good physics engine
 struct: im not really familiar with 3d stuff
 struct: to create the piece i had to look up multiple tutorials
 AntiSquid: but now you know how to, or got the idea of how to
 struct: I imported the svg, then added scalibility then I had to change from curves to mesh
 struct: yeah, thanks
 bayukendhil10: Hello

 PrO_Ogrmr: hello everyone everyday i will contribute a clash of code problem&#160;:)
 meh1001: you are a month early for new years resolutions!
 PrO_Ogrmr: ha
 Y0ursTruly: 2020 as good as over tho
 PrO_Ogrmr: hey
 PrO_Ogrmr: can i set my IDE a default template as my like
 PrO_Ogrmr: forever
 meh1001: not sure what you mean, but mine seems to remember my settings
 PrO_Ogrmr: oh,ok
 meh1001: then again maybe I never changed any and so it just seems like it's remembering because I'm used to the default...:sweat_smile:
 PrO_Ogrmr: :D

 Y0ursTruly: hmm the "Impossible" test case i cudn't deal
 Y0ursTruly: gg
 Y0ursTruly: oh it was to multiply it
 PrO_Ogrmr: yeah
 Y0ursTruly: i just did a check for if the divisor divides all clean.. then realised putting the opposite of that got a lot of them

 PrO_Ogrmr:  i making a contribution now, second contribution of today
 PrO_Ogrmr: check it out
 Stanworld: hello , from most of the challenge, the referree is on github.is there a tutorial to explain how to run a simulation on local computer?
 Lysk: yes, search for cg-brutaltester on github
 Stanworld: thanks Lysk
 eulerscheZahl: well, depends on what you want to do
 eulerscheZahl: brutaltester is a community tool
 eulerscheZahl: to run it the way it's intended (single threaded, with a replay showing in your webbrowser, local server) you have to build the maven project
 eulerscheZahl: brutaltester is to run a lot of games offline. but it will require some modifications of the referee first
 struct: managed to port the mirror example
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/kaY1ZHF.png">https://i.imgur.com/kaY1ZHF.png</a>

 struct: care on chrome might kill your browser
 eulerscheZahl: works perfectly fine for me
 AntiSquid: it's a different size for every browser? struct ... i don't see how
 Y0ursTruly: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/33894165b1065a09ca0ab9b868937d5e67e243d7">https://www.codingame.com/ide/33894165b1065a09ca0ab9b868937d5e67e243d7</a> the clash in this asks for one thing, i give it but the "anwers" are incorrect
 struct: what do you mean AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: oh nvm misread . 
 struct: ok euler, i guess ill work on firefox, i dont really need mirrors, but i think it will add something to the game, since the real one uses it
 eulerscheZahl: Y0ursTruly Something wrong happenedOnly the CodinGamer associated with this testsession can access it (412)
 struct: only add visual wise
 eulerscheZahl: share the task, IDE links won't work
 eulerscheZahl: i'm on chromium btw
 struct: The game im porting come with dlcs
 struct: and its a board game
 struct: lol
 AntiSquid: what game is it
 AntiSquid: and why do you use mirrors?

 struct: :D
 TWW: has anyone had one of the debug overlay options not be available? in a contest the 'fog of war' option is disabled for me but other players say it's working for them. It's not a league based contest so it's not like I haven't unlocked it yet
 struct: which game?
 PrO_Ogrmr: how read n lines in stub generator
 PrO_Ogrmr: with for loop
 PrO_Ogrmr: i got synta
 PrO_Ogrmr: syntax error
 eulerscheZahl: how does your broken stub look like?
 PrO_Ogrmr: loop 10
 eulerscheZahl: loop 10 what?
 PrO_Ogrmr: i should read n lines a string
 PrO_Ogrmr: loon n
 PrO_Ogrmr: loop n&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: then tell to read a string in the loop
 PrO_Ogrmr: ok
 eulerscheZahl: loop 10 read text:string(256)
 PrO_Ogrmr: ok
 eulerscheZahl: as documented&#160;;)
 PrO_Ogrmr:&#160;:)
 struct: cant increase line width on three js
 eulerscheZahl: what did you try? change material properties for the line?
 struct: i tried new THREE.LineBasicMaterial( { color: 0x0000ff, linewidth: 2 } );
 eulerscheZahl: looks reasonable, let me try
 struct: but the max is 1.0
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/136d54d9-fede-43e9-a5da-e156d3f3d610">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/136d54d9-fede-43e9-a5da-e156d3f3d610</a>
 struct:  Due to limitations of the OpenGL Core Profile with the WebGL renderer on most platforms linewidth will always be 1 regardless of the set value. 
 struct: oh well
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vrxcvg">https://prnt.sc/vrxcvg</a>set it to 10, definitely thicker than before
 struct: hmm, ill search a bit about it thanks
 PrO_Ogrmr: #new_contribution
 eulerscheZahl: and now that i know the puzzle i don't like the stub generator that i suggested anymore
 eulerscheZahl: loop n loopline n cell:int
 eulerscheZahl: and you forget a write statement in the stub
 PrO_Ogrmr:&#160;:\
 PrO_Ogrmr: but
 PrO_Ogrmr: it is
 PrO_Ogrmr: not needed
 PrO_Ogrmr: for nice solution
 PrO_Ogrmr: i think
 PrO_Ogrmr: print((n*n-s) * 7)
 PrO_Ogrmr: oh write
 PrO_Ogrmr: statement
 eulerscheZahl: just do something likewrite 7in the stub
 PrO_Ogrmr: ok
 struct: Something is not right
 struct: I know your solution works
 struct: But it seems like validators and testcases are made for that solution to work
 struct: ah wait
 struct: I didnt read properly
 eulerscheZahl: the statement is made for that
 struct:  There is exactly C cells which contains 1
 struct: yeah euler
 <b>**eulerscheZahl came up with that formula too</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: I missed this part

 Mr-DillinG: damn just finished my first puzzle on my own :D 
 struct: grats
 Mr-DillinG: Very new to coding so feels really good :D
 Mr-DillinG: still one puzzle really have me puzzled&#160;;) it is about arrays and sorting them according
 Mr-DillinG: Really need to reed up on tha
 Mr-DillinG: *that
 Astrobytes: wow struct, that looks interesting
 Astrobytes: well done Mr-DillinG

 struct: its like an extension for the previous versions
 Astrobytes: yeah I spotted this when I googled it
 struct: looks different and i dont think its studied
 Astrobytes: Mr-DillinG: sometimes writing things out on paper before doing any coding/looking up language features can really help
 Astrobytes: You reckon it's doable struct?
 struct: yeah
 Mr-DillinG: yea i started using adobe photoshop to write some ideas and calculations up in first :P
 struct: even if the 3d version isnt the normal version is
 Astrobytes: Mr-DillinG: use an online whiteboard or something lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I meant the 3D one struct, normal version looks doable for sure. And fun
 Mr-DillinG: Do you have any recommendations for an online whiteboard?
 Astrobytes: I only know this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://r7.whiteboardfox.com/">https://r7.whiteboardfox.com/</a>
 Astrobytes: It's also collaborative
 Astrobytes: So you can share the link and anyone can write on it
 Astrobytes: Probably a few others too
 Astrobytes: I use a real one because I'm old and in the way
 Astrobytes: :P
 jacek: it was the one we used that day?
 Astrobytes: Yeah :D
 Astrobytes: Or if you're on Windows you could use MS OneNote or something I guess
 therealbeef: or MS Whiteboard
 Astrobytes: yep

 PatrickMcGinnisII: Very Knotty struct
 struct: ty lets see if i can start doing the board today
 struct: I think i know enough of threejs now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, I'm not that familiar, but I do know all the ordering that's involve with 3d-&gt;2d transformation viewing
 struct: viewer is 3d
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so it's taking care of all the low-level stuff for you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG minecraft, that would take some of these puzzles to a new level
 Astrobytes: did you see euler's latest contrib PatrickMcGinnisII?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5774f141c59462b06e77d826d14d052d7966">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5774f141c59462b06e77d826d14d052d7966</a>
 Astrobytes: struct: what am I looking at in your images
 struct: the first was a "feature"
 struct: that made me stretch viewer
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG DOOMII
 struct: did not even know it was possible
 struct: the other one shows like 2 renders
 Astrobytes: Aha, gotcha
 struct: So you can have 2 cams
 struct: or even more
 Astrobytes: yep, I get it now
 Astrobytes: How's the performance?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, the tetris style thing?
 struct: on firefox is 60fps, on chrome it isnt, might be a me problem
 struct: since euler tested something on chromium and was fine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: spining it with the mouse is pretty cool!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ooooh, mouse wheel zoom
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Now we can play Xevious
 struct: all we need is more turns
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops, wrong game
 Astrobytes: Perhaps when CG sees boundaries being pushed that will happen at some point struct, who knows
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, I was thinking of Tempest

 Astrobytes: Hey, you'll remember Captain Blood Patrick, right?
 Astrobytes: (just popped into my head there, I guess some of our older French users might remember better)
 struct: never heard of it
 struct: but it is older than me
 Astrobytes: came out in the mid-late 80s iirc
 Astrobytes: we used to sit round the computer and play it as a family
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes a little, i don't think i liked it... although Ulrich had a kewl pseudonym ... damnit wish i could remember, SpacemanSpiff....nah, something else
 Astrobytes: No idea tbh, was a cool game imo though
 Astrobytes: PrO_Ogrmr: Again?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i worked for Namco America from 93-95, my name isn't on anything, but I can fix almost any stand-up arcade machine
 Astrobytes: is PrO_Ogrm r somebody's alt or something
 Astrobytes: Good skill to have Patrick. Now start using C on CG (I will keep nagging you :P )
 MSmits: hi guys
 Astrobytes: oh hey man, how are ya
 MSmits: good, very busy
 MSmits: it hurts me to have so many ideas to improve bots and not have time to code them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits, yea screw Bandas, darn thing is pissing me off
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, had a busy spell myself recently
 MSmits: bandas is hard to sim
 Astrobytes: AI course design thing go OK?
 MSmits: even though its not that much code
 MSmits: yeha
 MSmits: but thats mostly what i am busy with
 Astrobytes: kk
 MSmits: currently writing a page on evaluation functions, then minimax
 MSmits: there are some nice unplugged activities for minimax, just solving tree puzzles
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I managed to put the moves in a lookup table.... 6560 x2 possible move combinations per line
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a great way to get the algo in your head imo
 Astrobytes: works with a/b pruning too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: takes about 32k of codesize
 MSmits: huh PatrickMcGinnisII? why so many, there's 4 moves?
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah it does, i might not go that far though
 MSmits: maybe i'll expand it later
 PatrickMcGinnisII: every line of the board has a teritary representation....ie.   01201201
 struct: hi MSmits
 Astrobytes: hey, it's not a huge step in the scheme of things MSmits, perhaps make it optional
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do a move on it to the right with either player 0 or player 1 and you have 2 results
 MSmits: ohh right PatrickMcGinnisII, i get it, you look up each line to get the new state
 MSmits: hi struct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: god tired of all the loops
 MSmits: 8 lookups is not cheap either though
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah i would keep it optional. I am just strapped for time in writing it right now
 MSmits: optional things dont help me get the course done&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well they are in order, so index lookup might be....I'll time it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: time the dirrefernce between functions
 Astrobytes: Fair MSmits&#160;:)
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII, my bitboarded loopy thing does all rows at the same time basically
 MSmits: so it is at most 8 iterations
 MSmits: it's not 8x8
 struct: The rules dont explain well how pieces climb to tower&#160;:(
 MSmits: huh

 struct: new idea for multi MSmits
 struct: Khet 
 MSmits: I see 
 MSmits: I still havent even done Yinsh
 struct: Its fine, not many people did
 MSmits: I did do othello though
 struct: im bringing lasers this time
 struct: and 3d viewer
 MSmits: that was yours too wasnt it?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: my only nr 1's currently are your games :P
 Astrobytes: Where's my Amazons :P
 struct: I think i have it somewhere
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I rewrote the 2 for loop routine i had into more of a bitwise, still think lookup will be faster
 struct: let me check hd
 MSmits: laser and 3D sounds good
 MSmits: cant go wrong with lasers
 Astrobytes: indeed :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there was a laser puzzle game called blackout i think
 Astrobytes: this is more like chess with lasers, and layers if you go 3D
 Astrobytes: maybe simpler than chess, don't quote me
 Astrobytes: I'd never heard of it until this evening
 Astrobytes: MSmits did you see euler's new 3D contrib?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't find it on google, I have it in the other room
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: doesn't google know how old I am?  i know stuff before google existed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 MSmits: no i didnt Astrobytes

 MSmits: or maybe i did, not sure, link me&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits the zoom, rotations are worth it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: left lick hold, right click hold, and mouse wheel

 struct: Still works
 Astrobytes: eyyy awesome
 MSmits: no idea what i am looking at, but I likey
 Astrobytes: Amazons
 MSmits: ahh
 struct: Astrobytes since you are an english speaker
 struct: What do you understand from 3. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/p0Y35li.png">https://i.imgur.com/p0Y35li.png</a>
 struct: From whatI understand he can move up or down in z axis
 struct: if tower is directly above
 Astrobytes: yes that seems to be the case
 struct: very poor rules on the pdf
 struct: I dont even know how the tower works
 struct: which way it goes in and it goes out
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's a touch unclear. I'll need to look into the game a bit further to get a handle on it properly tbh
 struct: oh i get it now
 Astrobytes: I don't :D
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm out for tonight. See you all tomorrow, take care everyone
 struct: gn
 MSmits: gn
 struct: hmm
 struct: this game seems a reskin of laser chess
 struct: 1987
 cagdas001: is there any way to hide the chat section?
 Dagavin: Do you guys recommend a language to use here? or it makes no difference?
 ItsNotABug: played my missus at ultimate tic tac toe on paper and lost. Dont have much hope for building a bot lol
 therealbeef: cagdas001 click the little triangle at the bottom
 cagdas001: @therealbeef oh thanks! I first thought its purpose is to send the message :joy:
 Uljahn: Dagavin: there is a huge difference for clash and multiplayers, but for puzzles there is none
 therealbeef: just use one you enjoy or want to learn more about
 MSmits: ItsNotABug I lost to one of my students last week and I'm ranked 3rd on uttt
 MSmits: you dont have to be good at it to write a bot is what i'm saying
 therealbeef: basic principle of software engineering :D
 FerrusDude: :muscle:
 FerrusDude: :joy:
 FerrusDude: Every bot is a new learning experience.&#160;:)
 ItsNotABug: those who can't do... write a bot to do it for them
 ItsNotABug: is server running crazy slow again?
 tibithegreat: it's seems slow for me as well
 tibithegreat: thought maybe my internet was acting up or something, but some requests seem to take a bit long
 neilpop: the server is definetly acting super slow
 ClockSort: agreed
 neilpop: test dont run and server error keep showing up
 ItsNotABug: well, guess its bed time then. Night
 ClockSort: itsnotabug
 ClockSort: itsafeature.
 ItsNotABug: exactly :D 
 Rock-Lee: there is no one to play with me?

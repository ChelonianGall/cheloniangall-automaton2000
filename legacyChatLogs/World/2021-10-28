 aangairbender: what is default C param value for MCTS where scoring is -1, 0, 1
 aangairbender: If I remember correctly, its 0.5 for scoring 0, 0.5, 1 
 aaron9753: need non bias opinion (if even possible) which is better for game development, c# or python. I'm currently learning c# but have courses for python
 aangairbender: aaron9753 you can use c# in Unity, but not python
 aaron9753: can't python be used basically as addons for unity?
 aangairbender: idk, you can search for that, but for sure main scripting language is c#
 aaron9753: ight, than you!
 Uljahn: aangairbender: iirc it's sqrt(2)/2 for [-1, 0, 1] and sqrt(2) for [0, 0.5, 1]
 aangairbender: ty
 tobk: How, if at all, will this new contest be rated? It's first time to finish, not least time to complete, right? (Not that that's really important, just curious.)
 Uljahn: first 5 to finish will get t-shirts i guess
 Uljahn: first 5 teams
 darkhorse64: No CP, no XP, no IA ...
 Uljahn: yep, no achievements for the contest
 darkhorse64: It's not really a contest, actually
 Uljahn: a team-building event
 tobk: Good. That takes a bit away the pressure for the over-achievers, which probably means more fun for the team.
 tobk: Still a pity there's no "real" contest, but just sort of a big advertisement for the new game category, though...
 wyenat: That also means anyone in Asia won't win, since it's start at midnight on a weekday
 Uljahn: just take a day-off and break your sleeping schedule a bit
 wyenat: Same for Americas I guess, as I don't think many people will bother player a thursday's morning
 darkhorse64: You have 10 days to play it casually
 Uljahn: but then there is no difference with existing escape rooms
 TheBlueBias: You have 10 days too? :smirk:
 Uljahn: 2 hours are more than enough

 Thorcode: Uljahn could you show me your 4th testcase in mars lander 2?
 KyawMyotun: Fuck You
 KyawMyotun: :unamused:\
 Uljahn: watch your language or ban
 Carnage2: you
 ADC_PhamTrump: hi, i am beginner, and i wanna found a guy can teach me
 Thorcode: hi
 Thorcode: ADC_PhamTrump you can learn by solving problem here and if you stuck you could just ask on world chat for help
 Carnage2: :pensive:
 Thorcode: how long is the command ban effect&#160;?
 Carnage2: now
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: idk I will continue to try to solve mars lander 2 
 Thorcode: is there any document hint for this puzzle?
 Uljahn: External resources: PID controller, Dead reckoning etc.
 Thorcode: how to control horizontal speed
 Thorcode: I got 56
 Thorcode: and can reduce it
 Thorcode: can't
 herh: adjusting thrust accordingly
 Uljahn: tilt the lander in the opposite direction and use thrust
 Thorcode: I hate the horizontal speed
 Uljahn: you need some basic trigonometry i guess
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: I don't even know what is trigonometry
 Uljahn: then learn it or skip the puzzle
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: I will skip that puzzle
 Thorcode: thanks Uljahn
 mrmnrd: trigonometry is part of math handling relationships between angles and measures in a triangle (cos, sin, tan...)
 Thorcode: I know but I just in grade 8
 Thorcode: so understand that is not easy
 Thorcode: I have just seen some basic of it and my mind almost boom
 mrmnrd: i do&#160;:) it's matter to learn, you'll see it's not so complicated
 Thorcode: I will skip that puzzle
 Carnage2: wy
 Thorcode: that puzzle is too complicate for me
 Uljahn: not the best puzzle to learn trig, i suppose Mad Pod Racing is a bit better or something like CodeBusters
 Thorcode: how codebuster help me learn trig
 Thorcode: it just collecting ghost
 raizbro: hi
 raizbro: any Qustein

 raizbro: no
 Uljahn: guess it's enough, we talk about coding here
 kite1002: anyone can help with regex? I try to match 'A B C' from ( A B C ) with \( ([^ ]+(?= )&#160;?)+ \) but it only matches last word not all of them
 kite1002: \( ([^ ]+(?= )&#160;?)+ \)
 kite1002: using par space as boundary on each side so I try to use lookahead to not consume last space in the list of words
 kite1002: nvm I just needed to put another parenthesis around the whole thing since I got last match instead of all the matches at once
 NotGoodatall: an someone join my team for the event.
 KalamariKing: why are there *so many* new folk today
 KalamariKing: NotGoodatall you could always ask family or friends, you don't need much coding experience to partake this time

 eulerscheZahl: what's a fall challenge?
 b0n5a1: a bungee jump...
 b0n5a1: o/
 eggeggwe: I am ready for fall challenge!!
 chungangli: @altugtatlisu
 AntonCosmin: how many team members should be in a team?
 gjjkdfcjnsjfn: I am doing the challenge but it starts during PE so I might have to wait an hour or 2
 BrunoFelthes: today is a sad day :pensive:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/12-active-ai-game-competitions-ongoing-upcoming-6d97f3c3f920">https://towardsdatascience.com/12-active-ai-game-competitions-ongoing-upcoming-6d97f3c3f920</a>
 BrunoFelthes: any recommendations eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: i played yare. was fun but their next contest might take 4 months or so to start
 eulerscheZahl: gocoder is probably the next that I consider looking into
 ProCoder03: gocoder is nice..
 eulerscheZahl: LuxAI is running right now. Game looks nice, I just don't like those long running contests
 ProCoder03: except for the fact, it needs reinforcement learning or machine learning :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: it does not. you can play it however you want to
 eulerscheZahl: the organizers are interested in ML. but they don't enforce it. And I don't think that a ML approach will win the contest
 eulerscheZahl: that is: no neural networkif you consider MCTS and alike as ML too, then it has high chances
 ProCoder03: ohh... you mean I could go with a typical if-else decision tree&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 ProCoder03: Well, then got 4 months to prepare an all case decision tree for it 
 eulerscheZahl: or you step up your gameplay and simulate it properly&#160;;)
 ProCoder03: how will Russian AI Cup be&#160;?? 
 eulerscheZahl: they have complex games. let me find a few videos of previous contests
 ProCoder03: I could, but I am poor at writing simulators for now :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC 2019: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfImU0kAFI0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfImU0kAFI0</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can still watch 2020 replays here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 2018: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p73XwFCbkA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p73XwFCbkA</a>
 eulerscheZahl: in 2017 they had a starcraft-like strategy game with fog of war and different terrains that make some units stronger and others weaker
 eulerscheZahl: ground and air units
 ProCoder03: that was nice :smile:
 ProCoder03: thanks 
 eulerscheZahl: and if you want a free tshirt, you can usually get it in 1-2 afternoons
 Astrobytes: and receive it sometime this decade
 ProCoder03: is it ongoing&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: 360 tshirts, 60 hoodies to win. just be patient as delivery takes a year :D
 ProCoder03: lol 
 eulerscheZahl: RAIC has ended in January. Next contest starts in February 2022
 eulerscheZahl: takes ages but they ship it in the end. I've never not received it so far (still waiting for 2021)
 ProCoder03: February 2022 , well it will be a pretty tight month for you, bomberland, yare and RAIC 
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if i can handle all of it&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but bomberland starts in december
 eulerscheZahl: yare will also launch the new game earlier. just a contest around february
 eulerscheZahl: and RAIC: if it starts in February, it will end in March
 eulerscheZahl: maybe even April
 ProCoder03: yeah, I misinterpreted the announcement for bomberland
 ProCoder03: for yare, any ideas when the new ones will come&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: and I only want the hoodie, so not going all-in at RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know regarding yare
 ProCoder03: well mostly everyone participates for swags :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: if there are multiple interesting contests going on, it helps to decide
 eulerscheZahl: wouldn't have taken 3 days off for Huawei without the prizes
 Marchete: 1st at LuxAI is called Toad Brigade :spy:
 Marchete: coincidence? I don't think so!
 eulerscheZahl: i wish i could claim authorship over that bot
 eulerscheZahl: $4000 for the winner, not bad
 ProCoder03: atlast they updated languages with puzzles completed
 ProCoder03: is the certification valid humph&#160;??
 ProCoder03: I mean is it accepted by companies 
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, I didn't even bother doing their tests
 ProCoder03: I tried C# and got better than 99% professionals :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they consider you as better than me because I didn't take the test?
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen so many &gt;99%, that's the only explanation I have
 0zero0: hello everyone
 dbdr: are you guys doing the contest&gt;
 dbdr:&#160;?
 ProCoder03: obviously I just started C# an year ago
 eulerscheZahl: in 4 mins i will log out and don't return for the next 7 days
 ProCoder03: dbdr I am just attempting 
 0zero0: yes
 tomie24: yes, can't wait
 dbdr: boycotting eulerscheZahl?
 0zero0: oh no
 eulerscheZahl: maybe. and not moderating the chat
 eulerscheZahl: so do some other mods
 ProCoder03: we have an attendee of 12k which was 5k less than previous fall challenge 
 eulerscheZahl: we are an inclusive community now, everyone can spam
 dbdr: I don't even have a team
 eulerscheZahl: you can play solo
 dbdr: ok
 eulerscheZahl: registered players&#160;!= participants
 eulerscheZahl: the last contest had similar registration count
 ProCoder03: atleast 80% 
 dbdr: also going on a trip tomorrow at 3:30 am, so not sure how much time I'll have. and how much time is needed
 ProCoder03: it says 2 hrs 
 ProCoder03: probably 1 hr 
 eulerscheZahl: i predict 40min for the first to finish
 eulerscheZahl: but i have no idea
 Astrobytes: Not doing it, not moderating.
 Nikgame: glhf everyone
 tomie24: I am going solo as well
 tomie24: gl
 eulerscheZahl: only saw the roman numerals on the candles
 Mundgus: glhf&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: in the contest artwork
 eggeggwe: last 30 seconds!!!
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, see you next week :wage:

 wackadoodle: 1 man teams ftw
 Beretta_Vexee: One wo/man army&#160;!
 Not_Mee: 1 army man
 tomie24: I guess most teams will be of size 1
 ProCoder03: lot of one man armies, Ig
 eggeggwe: my team size is 5, but 4 of mine are sleeping though
 KVNMDS: Hello I am with Lucas

 Essenti: maybe :D
 eggeggwe: maybe
 C_Minor: I got 504 error
 dbdr: they said they wait a few minutes for teams to coordinate
 Beretta_Vexee: Alors on joue&#160;!  #AoE
 Zardosh: they said on the help page that they'd wait 15 mins for all teams to be ready
 Essenti: can i start tomorrow if my team cant today?
 Mahin1729: Can I join the event anytime in the next 7 days?
 schachmatt: wait did they change it to allow 1 player teams?
 schachmatt: (been out of the loop for a while)
 ProCoder03: yeah sure, you don't need to start now 
 Essenti: cool, thanks
 ProCoder03: you can start anytime in next 7 days
 tomie24: yes but you don't have a chance for top 5 and win a t-shirt then
 ge_pet: do we qualify for something else later?or it is just this?
 Essenti: oh no :O i ven diddnt knew that i can win something, my prize is a fun
 tomie24: well mine too since I doubt I will be anywhere close to top 5
 Zardosh: top 5 is probably gonna be reserved to 6 plr teams
 1612584: when the game is starting&#160;:)
 dbdr: soon
 Nikgame: it feels like waiting for a train in germany
 eggeggwe: maybe soon
 Nikgame: you think it starts at 6 but will be 7 lol

 AlexHL: yes
 bitwiseio: ah nice, ty for the information
 eggeggwe: can someone tell me hoe to stop the timer?

 Zardosh: cant execute code
 Zardosh: is it just me?
 razorbeard: @Nikgame im just facing it im crying
 eggeggwe: no more 502QAQ
 razorbeard: same error 5xx
 [K]Gabor: no, we cant either
 TinieblaOscura: rip event
 ProCoder03: yeah, Mine just quit 
 Nikgame: we did it
 Nikgame: no clue how but yeah
 ProCoder03: what di you do&#160;??
 Nikgame: code execution insnt working for me rn, so im waiting
 Zardosh: cant run code aswell
 Schneewittchen: japs
 Westicles: surprised nobody is streaming it
 Nikgame: im in uni so i cant stream rn
 ProCoder03: Westicles, its not even smooth 
 ProCoder03: did you finish that chruch prob&#160;??
 alenic: regarding fall challenge it's a nice idea but the system crash continuosly and it is impossible to run the code
 Zardosh: would be really bad if some teams are currently being able to run code while others cant
 TinieblaOscura: AMEN
 jacek: oO
 Nikgame: yeah
 Nikgame: we cant execute
 Hysta: can't even get in
 ProCoder03: Internal CG regret: running Bot programming would have saved them more bucks and some negative feedback than this event :joy:
 eggeggwe: i think a lot od 502s made me almost cry
 makerecho: is the challenge supposed to work?
 makerecho: we can not execute any code ... it just throws bunch of js errors 
 _martynas: it brokey
 bjy: welp...
 ProCoder03: people who don't live in France..
 Hysta: even people living in France...
 ProCoder03: lets agree on a pact... lets all come and do this one afterwards 
 eggeggwe: damn.....my country are far from France(
 Hysta: Can't run
 Zardosh: wait are ppl in france able to run code?
 makerecho: i tried chrome, firefox,  even went for edge XD still same  error 
 makerecho: Network Error [504]Unexpected token &lt; in JSON at position 0
 Zardosh: i see a team with a french team
 Zardosh: french name
 Zardosh: gaining progress
 razorbeard: dont wry im in france i have the same prob
 Hysta: No, I'm from France and I can't run anything. So not everyone from there is able to run code
 ProCoder03: nope people who live in france are near to CG infra thus they get much quicker response
 ProCoder03: the leading team all are french 
 ProCoder03: take time to see 
 makerecho: i am on team with guy in paris and he can't run anything ...
 Hysta: It really depends even from France
 ProCoder03: these guys are from lyon 
 Hysta: Well they're lucky
 ProCoder03: *most of these
 Zardosh: yea but imo they should just cancel this and reschedule it to some other day
 Zardosh: cuz this is really unfair
 Zardosh: only a small percentage of teams is able to progress
 razorbeard: yep and the chrono is still running
 Hysta: worst is time running out^^
 AlexHL: maybe they should make the Challenge to make the Challenge stable
 razorbeard: haha
 Runner87: 502 without press START
 AlexHL: :grin:

 ProCoder03: just got it :disappointed:
 B4tiste: I'm at Lyon, and cannot process anything, stop crying azbout your location
 Zardosh: there are teams progressing and they are mostly french, even if you aren't able to run code, some teams are
 Zardosh: and you should be complaining aswell
 razorbeard: seems to work try again guys
 landyns.: hi
 sikr_: lol
 ProCoder03: B4tiste just check out the top 10, they all are mostly french

 ProCoder03: yes
 Zardosh: even if they fix it now, one of the teams is about to win
 Zardosh: they should redo the entire event some other day
 [CG]Thibaud: we're looking into the issue
 5atchm1n: servser are KO
 jacek: Oo
 Westicles: I guess you can't see the leaderboard unless you start?
 SmokingJoe: funny contest indeed, you cant do anything 
 Zardosh: i was able to run code once
 Zardosh: but thats it
 Westicles: oh, you can see leaderboard but not progression
 _martynas: The 2nd team just completed one task
 _martynas: Puzzles look good for Coding Escape but this event doesn't fit the Fall/Spring challenge vibes... Unable to participate temporarily wouldn't be a bad thing in bot programming contests...
 vklidu: Tak to se vám moc nepovedlo pánové!
 ProCoder03: the leading team has 3 tasks left 
 EveryOS: Yea. But since this is timed, it is very bad. How did the leading team overcome the 502s?
 jacek: they bribed CG
 EveryOS: xD
 ProCoder03: lol
 WolfDarrigan: They have an ethernet cable patched directly into the servers&#160;;)
 ProCoder03: those were french team 
 Westicles: I bet it is dbdr, he'll win for sure
 ProCoder03: nope dbdr is not on there team 
 razorbeard: guys try again 
 razorbeard: it seems to work
 ProCoder03: unlessing he is using another acc
 jacek: its hammertime
 Westicles: no hammers this week.  work stoppage
 ProCoder03: I lost interest, its boring 
 ProCoder03: euler's idea jacek no mod for this week 
 EveryOS: I'm on a 2 person team, and started very confused, but we've managed to complete 2 tasks. But I've managed to figure out one puzzle, while my teammate solved the other. I'm amazed that some teams have 15 puzzles solved. We've only done 1/8th of that (and thanks to the 502s, we are taking a break)
 ProCoder03: razorbeard not for still bad gateway 
 ProCoder03: reminds me of microsoft build this year :joy:
 razorbeard: damn
 razorbeard: im out also, what a pity&#160;:(
 Westicles: 3 winners
 makerecho: lol. 3 teams already done and some can't even load the thing&#160;:/
 jacek: is it over for them?
 ProCoder03: 4 now

 jacek: heres :taco: for ya
 IgnacioGb: Hi guys,  In the Outum Fall challenge how can I add members to my team if i have already started the challenge?
 Runner87: if I start a solo player game then can I start a team session&#160;?
 magmasa: cringe contest when position in leaderboard is dependent website not working
 Westicles: it is more fun anyhow if you don't rush through it
 magmasa: then dont make it competitive
 magmasa: and its fie
 magmasa: fine, servers wont crash

 stefan-gg: whi is there an overtime&#160;?
 stefan-gg: why*
 Zardosh: i hope they do something about the downtime
 Westicles: I would love to see #fr auto-translated and added to #world.  Some great discussions over there
 Wontonimo: autotranslate works wonders
 Wontonimo: and my very poor French comprehension
 jacek: deepL eh
 Wontonimo: well, since noone seems to be discussing multis or puzzles I'm gonna log off and check in maybe tomorrow

 JBM: that's Agile for you
 Astrobytes: login endpoint changed from CodinGamer/loginSiteV2 to CodinGamer/loginSite
 JBM: barely signifncant
 Astrobytes: Just grab session cookieNot sure if anything else changed
 _.Martin_.: how do i beat the 2nd boss
 Astrobytes: Report him to the 3rd boss
 Westicles: userId = r.json()['codinGamer']['userId']KeyError: 'codinGamer'
 Westicles: seems to have broken the NS script
 _.Martin_.: huh
 Astrobytes: Westicles: Discord I'm afraid but might be useful info here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/466965651135922208/902908142982168607">https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/466965651135922208/902908142982168607</a>
 AntiSquid: oh SNU is on the leaderboard
 Westicles: Astrobytes, thanks
 Astrobytes: Westicles: np man
 Noyotens: what is way to display a sequence of such corners, and of translating them into UP/DOWN outputs in the fall challenge
 AntiSquid: are you asking for solution during the contest&#160;? @_@
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 take care of him
 Automaton2000: how can i start tomorrow if my team cant today?
 _.Martin_.: i need help with the 2nd boss
 Noyotens: AntiSquid what if i didnt complete before 2 hours
 Daaaaaan: I died :D
 Daaaaaan: Why this is so hard 
 Daaaaaan: ahahaha
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: team up with AutomatonNN
 Automaton2000: they don't have to track it yourself
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: I can also lend you CGActivity_Bot if you need (but beware, it's a angry turtle)
 Automaton2000: it's not really my kind of game
 oki098: Is rust a good language to learn for this 
 oki098:&#160;?
 oki098: c++ is terrible for competitive programming 
 oki098: takes more time to write things down so
 elio27: bon je suis 7/8 y'a un type qui a leak la réponse dans le chat mais j'étais trop occupé à me casser la tête à comprendre
 elio27: sorry wrong chat
 Dustyy: What???!!!!
 Cukinoden: can someone explain to me what the heck is going on in the glass 
 Cukinoden: the clans and castle what was that&#160;!!
 ninnghazad: i kinda flailed at the fall thing today. =/ but still was fun. did stupid things, like clicking the hints just to see what happens. costs time is what happens. or pay attention to my annoying kid, which did nothing for my score!! think im gonna do the winter thingy too. was kinda different from what i expected - i thought it'd be like just coding and not so... visual. nice change of pace.
 Zardosh: the contest was really cool but the downtime in the middle of everything was unfortunate
 ninnghazad: i came late, just had some weird short disconnects but no real wait inbetween. 
 MadKnight: wait, is yellow on clan flags called Orange&#160;?
 ninnghazad: ye, theres no yellow i think
 Triv: hi
 MadKnight: why can't i find clan flag for a description&#160;?
 ninnghazad: cause you describe wrong probly
 MadKnight: did u find the half green flag name?
 ninnghazad: ye i found all the flags i searched for. remember symbols can be invisible but still have a type.
 MadKnight: oh now that's a surprise
 MadKnight: but i still can't find the middle flag
 ninnghazad: oh, the center flag, the last one is special - theres a note about somewhere in the room.
 c0d34: hjghjfghj
 Scarfield: hey MadKnight have you seen that csb changed name to "Mad Pod Racing"?
 c0d34: does anyone know how to increase the amount of hits you need to take down an alien?
 MadKnight: yes Scarfield i did
 MadKnight: ninnghazad i still can't find the green one 
 ninnghazad: i just searched for one corner i knew and checked the other corners of these few manually. was faster than writing like 16 conditions. 
 ninnghazad: there were only like 4 that came with the corner i searched for. so it was obvious which one was the good one
 MadKnight: i count the number of green corners and the number of white corners with 4 blue rectangles
 MadKnight: and finds something when i remove the condition for the symbols
 ninnghazad: so print those you find and look if there are any that match the other 3 corners. 
 MadKnight: i dunno but when i removed the condition for 4 symbols i passed it
 MadKnight: what's the yellow one's symbol called?
 ninnghazad: i think i had different colors and flags
 MadKnight: it's like a spike thingy
 ninnghazad: probably the lily
 ninnghazad: like a spearhead with two side thingies and a point middle thingy
 MadKnight: well it can't find it again
 ninnghazad: so you have 4 and missing only center flag?
 ninnghazad: try searching for 4 background colors only then - you probably end up with like 2 or 3 that fit and you can guess from there.
 Noyotens: i spent two hours looking for half green flag just cause i used SymbolColor instead of Color
 Noyotens: :frowning2:
 MadKnight: lol rip
 MadKnight: well mine turned out to only have 3 symbols instead of 4
 MadKnight: and they were circles
 ninnghazad: aw man... i clicked that first manual tombstone puzzle thing like 30 times from the beginning because it just didn't get how it worked.
 MadKnight: no wait, rectangles, but still 3
 ninnghazad: does codegolf count whitespace?
 MadKnight: what are there clan locations for?
 ninnghazad: that comes soon
 Westicles: MK, good to see you
 Westicles: They renamed CSB in honor of you
 MadKnight: oh i also needed to print the left side ones
 Noyotens: i found the middle shield what should i do
 MadKnight: why did i come back now everyone is gonna mention that to me
 ChaosConstant2828: g
 Westicles: yes, everyone will for sure.  over and over
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 unrename it
 Automaton2000: i've never done a clash
 ninnghazad: it's kinda hectic
 ninnghazad: a bit like crunchtime, but you don't get paid.
 MadKnight: having so much fun looking for a path for my castles on this huge map
 MadKnight: are u having fun, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think there's a fix for that
 ninnghazad: glasses. put em on.
 MadKnight: next one looks fun but let's take a break
 Noyotens: if you take a break and close the page is the timer keep going?
 MadKnight: probably
 MadKnight: Westicles did u complete the game&#160;?
 Thorcode: what the time know in Europe?
 Thorcode: now
 MadKnight: okay google
 Noyotens: 1:45 AM
 Thorcode: thanks
 Noyotens: np
 Thorcode: that why my friend is not here
 ninnghazad: it's the perfect time to give em a call!
 ninnghazad: let em know u care!
 Thorcode: I tried
 ninnghazad: lol =)
 ninnghazad: --friends
 Thorcode: I think they are sleeping
 Wontonimo: hi friends
 Thorcode: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hey Thorcode
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what?? MadKnight is  here?!?
 xions: whats up
 Wontonimo: hey MadKnight&#160;!
 MadKnight: nope
 Fabricioo:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: long time
 MadKnight: me not here
 Wontonimo: i've missed chatting
 MadKnight: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MadKnight: did u complete the game Wontonimo&#160;?
 Wontonimo: I have not entered fall challenge 2021
 Wontonimo: have you started?
 MadKnight: yep
 MadKnight: it's like single player
 Thorcode: In this time I can still invite teammate right? 
 MadKnight: dunno
 MadKnight: i'm playing solo
 Wontonimo: are you having fun MK&#160;?
 Justin-Truong: I will try to solo that challenge :D
 DustinWestGlow: guys hello
 Wontonimo: good luck Justin-Truong
 Wontonimo: hey DustinWestGlow and xions and Fabricioo
 Wontonimo: welcome to codingame
 DustinWestGlow: thanks man that was quite a shoutout
 Wontonimo: so loud it made you see red
 Wontonimo: btw, whenever someone mentions your name it will appear red for you only
 DustinWestGlow: yeah i just did 3 clashes im contemplating lifeOkay, Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: no need for "@" or "#", just the name will do.  Start typing someones name then press tab t oautocomplete
 Wontonimo: yeah, like that
 Wontonimo: typing /help will show you some more options
 DustinWestGlow: /me
 DustinWestGlow: yeah so /me is contemplating all Greek wisdom after those 3 clashes
 DustinWestGlow: all Greek philosophy what was Plato thinking who made the pillars of reasoning
 Wontonimo: did you find it difficult DustinWestGlow or easy?
 DustinWestGlow: I know how to use Python and stackoverflowBut I don't have experience implementing algorithms by the book and practice recognizing what to use whereso I did not finish first. Maybe I can look at it from a better angle than self-study. A lot of people seem to be self taught but maybe I can do better. I have a whole Fall Break to take action toward that though.
 Wontonimo: have you tried the puzzles?
 Wontonimo: they may be better for you.  they are not timed and allow you time to do research
 Wontonimo: here is what is generally considered the 2nd puzzle <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 DustinWestGlow: No, I haven't. I can do the research. I just found the Descent thanks, very much.
 Wontonimo: and here is one that I made <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine</a>
 DustinWestGlow: ok
 Wontonimo: that is in the "easy" category
 Wontonimo: the puzzles take a lot more time than the clashes.  Don't keep track of time, just have fun solving parts of it
 Wontonimo: what language are you using DustinWestGlow?
 DustinWestGlow: That is reasonable. so, I'm using Python but I completed a coding course with a few other languages. Thanks so much for your help to a stranger like me.
 joniebear: 🐍 language, best language
 Wontonimo: oh, i didn't know you were a stranger.  ah man, 2nd mistake today
 joniebear: Is there a code golf for Fax Machine? 
 Wontonimo: if you want to practice python specifically and want something a little more gentle than codingame, try this free site <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a> (then come back)
 Wontonimo: there are only 4 code golfs <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf</a>
 MadKnight: well i did, Wontonimo
 DustinWestGlow: yeah... RGB compression is what Fax Machine looks like.
 Wontonimo: but you can submit 3 language entries per golf
 Justin-Truong: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3192dfbc-7635-4460-9666-270d38b8a341">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3192dfbc-7635-4460-9666-270d38b8a341</a>
 Justin-Truong: is this is horizontal
 Wontonimo: a horizontal what?
 Wontonimo: what's the puzzle you are working on&#160;?
 Justin-Truong: how can I remove "" in my list?
 DustinWestGlow: I don't have a capital s key
 Wontonimo: Justin-Truongif you list is ["hi","","there","justin"]
 Justin-Truong: yep
 Justin-Truong: not that
 Justin-Truong: I want to delete all the "" in my list
 Wontonimo: you can remove "" like soresult = [x of x in stuff if x!=""]
 Wontonimo: result = ["hi","there","justin"]
 Justin-Truong: thanks
 DustinWestGlow: so, how come regular expressions were difficult to find internet resources for? I just found out a few things but it's a googling copy paste mess. Are there any resources you can point me to?
 Wontonimo: ask me a couple questions and i'll answer as best i can
 DustinWestGlow: okay
 ninnghazad: check out <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://regex101.com/">https://regex101.com/</a>
 ninnghazad: i like the online thingies for regex to try and check expressions
 Wontonimo: +1  nice link
 Wontonimo: but, the offer still stands.  I'll do my best to answer regex questions
 DustinWestGlow: why were they taught in coding courses?
 Wontonimo: what coding courses?
 DustinWestGlow: Freecodecamp
 Wontonimo: why were regex taught somewhere?  i can only imagine it's because REGEX IS FRIKIN POWERFUL
 Wontonimo: it is a language upon itself
 ninnghazad: ye, but it's like writing brainfuck
 DustinWestGlow: my apologies I must leave for an eventI will follow u
 Wontonimo: no, it sure isn't.  it is pretty straight forward if you don't abuse it
 Wontonimo: for example,
 Wontonimo: if you want to match the word "sup", you simply use "sup"
 Wontonimo: if you want to match "sup" or "soup" you have a few choices
 Wontonimo: "(sup|soup)"
 Wontonimo: this is an or statement and you can list as many items seperated by | as you like
 Wontonimo: another ways is like this "sou?p" 
 Wontonimo: the "?" means the previous letter is optional
 Wontonimo: another is "s(o|ou)p"
 Wontonimo: again, the stuff between () is an or list
 Justin-Truong: how to change ['hi','there'] to ["hi","there"]&#160;?
 Justin-Truong: oops
 Wontonimo: no need
 Justin-Truong:&#160;?
 Justin-Truong: I need that
 Justin-Truong: oh
 Justin-Truong: I have a way to do that
 Justin-Truong: no
 Justin-Truong: I need to learn
 Justin-Truong: I wish I have a full 2 hours to solve it
 Wontonimo: do puzzles instead of clash
 Justin-Truong: no I'm trying fall challenge
 Justin-Truong: and I can't focus or stop the challenge
 MoMaT: ask team for help
 MoMaT: or relax, let it go and finish tomorrow
 Wontonimo: you better finish it because if you don't all the worst things possible will happen, like you'll have to eat broccoli tomorrow for breakfast.
 ninnghazad: mmmm, broccoli...
 Wontonimo: and you wan't have clean socks on monday and everyone will point at your shoes
 Wontonimo: think of all the bad things that will happen Justin-Truong... you have to finish this challenge
 Justin-Truong: I can't stop that challenge and I need to learn online
 Justin-Truong: I hate that
 Justin-Truong: I wish I would finish that
 Wontonimo: i hope you've learnt your lesson grasshopper
 Wontonimo: timed challenges are not good for learning.  they are only good for assessing
 Justin-Truong: yep
 Justin-Truong: and my teacher always call me
 Justin-Truong: so I can't do the challenge as well
 Justin-Truong:&#160;:(((((((((((((((((((((
 ninnghazad: stop stressing yourself out dude
 Wontonimo: no, more stress, max stress, that's how we make diamonds
 Justin-Truong: yep
 Wontonimo: i'm kidding
 ninnghazad: compress all the stress + lubricate with tears = superdiamonds
 Justin-Truong: really bro
 Wontonimo: you don't want your carbon crushed down to the size of a mellon 
 Justin-Truong: well I can't solo that fall as well
 Justin-Truong:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: if the test is a 42Km run in 4 hours, and you *only* make it 25Km...  did you fail?
 Wontonimo: hell, if I made it 25km in 4 hours that'd be a huge success for me
 ninnghazad: lol if i made 25km in a week i'd be proud
 Wontonimo: yeah, but according to *someone else* we would have failed the test, so ... there's a message in there somewhere
 Wontonimo: i think it's that we are out of shape :D
 Wontonimo: lower your standards, that's the secret to happiness (and a life long love of coding)
 Justin-Truong: ok
 Justin-Truong: thanks guy
 Wontonimo: anytime you need me to get up on my soapbox and spit random life advice that will probably not help, I'm here for you
 Justin-Truong: I will stop trying that challenge and keep on learning on my school for the test 
 Justin-Truong: and let my brain relax
 MadKnight: so why are u not doing the challenge Wontonimo&#160;?
 Justin-Truong: Have you finish that challenge Mad Knight?
 Wontonimo: i don't like escape mazes
 dkslslep: 1
 Wontonimo: i've done 2 in person and 1 online already.  all three experiences were blah
 ProCoder03: Morning everyone&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: it doesn't help that i suck at them
 Wontonimo: hey ProCoder03
 ProCoder03: hello Wontonimo
 Thorcode: sad for you my bro Justin-Truong
 ProCoder03: wait are you both same&#160;??
 ProCoder03: *aren't
 Thorcode: not now
 Wontonimo: who both same?
 Justin-Truong: yep
 Thorcode: know Justin-Truong nick is from my neubour
 Thorcode: coussin
 Thorcode: my bad grammar
 Thorcode: now
 ProCoder03: My fall challenge is now running at 9hr and 45 mins :laughing:
 Justin-Truong: yep it does pause
 Justin-Truong: I think I finishl do it in this afternoon
 Justin-Truong: *not
 Justin-Truong: doing
 Justin-Truong: I got 1hr40 min
 Justin-Truong: and the time does not stop
 ProCoder03: It was not as fun as that steam house 
 Justin-Truong: Sherlock is better
 Justin-Truong: steam house kinda hard
 ProCoder03: That was too easy 
 ProCoder03: sherlock
 Justin-Truong: yep
 Thorcode: I got top 1% in steam housse
 Thorcode: 2 attempt :D
 ProCoder03: not counted :smile:
 Justin-Truong: bye I gotta learn
 ProCoder03: bye
 Thorcode: bye bro
 Thorcode: keep learning stupid online :D
 Thorcode: school
 ProCoder03: you guys still have online schools&#160;??
 ProCoder03: lucky 
 Justin-Truong: yep
 Justin-Truong: still online
 Justin-Truong: but my teacher always call me
 Justin-Truong: so I can't focus on coding
 Thorcode: not me
 Thorcode: I can still coding while online school
 Justin-Truong: lucky for you 
 Justin-Truong: bye I have an test
 Justin-Truong: and that site have a good hack dectection
 joniebear: Well, here it goes. My first clash contribution :D
 Wontonimo: nice, congrats
 Wontonimo: expect your first contribution to have a LOT of feedback
 joniebear: Well, it better. The instructions are a bit vague at times :P 
 untillness: hello
 ___I_am_Loser___: std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello, World\n";
 Husoski: fprintf(stderr, "Goodbye, cruel world!\n");
 ProCoder03: next == groups.length &amp;&amp; (next = 0); what does this do in JS&#160;??
 Husoski: That's a fancy if statement, same as:if (next == groups.length) next = 0;
 Husoski: The idea is that the right side of &amp;&amp; isn't evaluated if the left side is false.
 ProCoder03: :man_facepalming:
 ProCoder03: why do they overcomplicate things
 Thorcode: kinda nice Jonibear
 joniebear: :blush: thanks!
 Zardosh: does any of u guys know any games similar to coding escape?
 Zardosh: does any of u guys know of any games similar to coding escape?
 Zardosh: sry double msg
 Thorcode: yeah I want to have a game like that too
 ProCoder03: do the escapes in escape.codingame.com
 Zardosh: its a really fun experience but theres too few rooms that we can access
 ProCoder03: yeah 
 Zardosh: ive done them already
 Thorcode: me too
 Zardosh: man it'd be cool if they opened up another room as compensation for todays downtime XD
 Thorcode: try fall bro
 Thorcode: fall challenge
 Zardosh: yea ive done it
 Thorcode: finished?
 Zardosh: but there was a 30+min downtime in the middle of it
 Zardosh: yea
 Thorcode: all of it
 Zardosh: yes
 Zardosh: finished 21th
 Thorcode: nice
 Zardosh: the downtime was unfortunate
 Zardosh: as some teams were able to still run code
 Zardosh: while others couldnt
 Thorcode: you got 21 place?
 Zardosh: yea
 ProCoder03: I got 1hr downtime 
 ProCoder03: :sob:
 ProCoder03: why me&#160;??
 Zardosh: 21st place relative to the start of the event
 Zardosh: damn i wrote 21th before
 Zardosh: sorry lol
 ProCoder03: congrats btw 
 Thorcode: nice
 Zardosh: thx
 Thorcode: Itachi in atasuki?
 Zardosh: yes

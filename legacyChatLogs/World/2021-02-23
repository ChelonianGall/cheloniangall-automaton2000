 reCurse: Enough spam
 reCurse: Thanks
 MuhammadMehediHasan: How you get a moderator badge? 
 reCurse: Why do you care?
 MuhammadMehediHasan: you're a real mod?
 MuhammadMehediHasan: Nice &lt;3

 Kitkat260: is anyone here really good at clash of code/
 Kitkat260:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Not a single person, no.
 Kitkat260: ok
 NOTsteve: Do you need help with something or were you just wondering if anyone feels confident?
 dragginballs: all yall trash 
 Kitkat260: sup
 Oeloeloeloe: Whats up
 Kitkat260: hru
 Oeloeloeloe: Great, hbu?
 Kitkat260: ehh
 Kitkat260: school
 Kitkat260: is crazzy
 Oeloeloeloe: How come?
 PrinceJordan: this is difficult they don't but real prince's through this lol
 Kitkat260: i hate homework
 Oeloeloeloe: I understand
 Oeloeloeloe: Used to hate it too
 Kitkat260: yea
 Oeloeloeloe: Try to make it fun
 Oeloeloeloe: It helps
 PrinceJordan: i dont care for homework i have no prob with it
 Kitkat260: wow
 PrinceJordan: i work way better under pressure so thats why im ok with it
 Kitkat260: nice
 kunomels:&#160;:)
 jacek: AutomatonNN eh
 AutomatonNN: eso in companies offer the link to it and then we use it for you and then the contest is over by the
 jacek: AutomatonNN should be called AutomatonMLP
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the contest?
 Astrobytes: Hmph. At least we had peace for a day.
 Uljahn: my little perceptron
 Astrobytes: Better than multi-layered pony I guess
 RustyMysteryFromTheSwamps_fe5b: Hi guys
 AntiSquid: drain the swamp!
 AntiSquid: hi
 Saphine: #clash <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/16078424e2f0294caf387125ad5c122193e9bf0">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/16078424e2f0294caf387125ad5c122193e9bf0</a>
 Astrobytes: Saphine: The idea of the #clash channel is that you click on #clash and post the link in there&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Then you can say "would anyone like to join my #clash"
 Astrobytes: Although I'm not sure why I care tbh.
 jacek: you're mod, it's your mission
 AntiSquid: i consider this "mistake" to be intentional
 jacek: youre overthinking
 AntiSquid: tell me what i should think, i am dependant on others to have my own opinion
 jacek: jacek is op
 Saphine: Oh sorry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek is PEBCAC AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: Hi, guys does anybody knows the solution to the game
 BlaiseEbuth: Ze solution to Ze game. The only one. My preciouuuus.
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: ANEO sponsored puzzle... I think I half the way.. but I cannot get through
 BlaiseEbuth: If you stop in the middle of the way you'll probably be hurted when the lights will turn green...
 Kitkat260: hello
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I think , I am not understanding the problem at all
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: so I already calculated the average distance
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: sorry speed
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: but when I play all the test cases, it doesnt work
 Kitkat260: same
 Kitkat260: same
 BlaiseEbuth: Do  you mean that you're printing the same answer for all test cases&#160;?
 Kitkat260: yes
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: yeah, depending on the output but I am not getting the correct answer
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not what that is expected. Your code must compute the answer of each test case.
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: 501200 10  like this case I am just getting 76
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I dont understand then how it gets an answer of 36
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra:  I thought that by following the formula speed=distance/time would get the right answer
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: but nope
 BlaiseEbuth: Have you read the statement&#160;?
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: yeah, but probably I am not getting it right
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I think thats my problem
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I will read again
 Imnewhelp: how to solve it lol
 Imnewhelp: im dumb
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I think this problem involves a bit more math
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: and analythical skills
 Imnewhelp: yea
 PatrickMcGinnisII: usually people forget to convert km/h and duration to more manageable integers
 Imnewhelp: teach me?
 Imnewhelp: im new to this "world"
 Imnewhelp: how do you collect even and odd numbers?
 Imnewhelp: and by "sum" do they mean add them together?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: try multiplying both by 3600 then compare the computed time float by integer division by each duration...if even...then it hits a green light
 Imnewhelp: ...
 Imnewhelp: English 
 Imnewhelp: plz
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you looop from your maxspeed down to 1
 Imnewhelp: why multiply it by 3600
 Imnewhelp: how to do that
 Imnewhelp: do you have discord
 Imnewhelp: can u be my sensai
 Astrobytes: did someone miss their Ritalin dose today?
 Imnewhelp: 19 secods
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and at each of these speeds, count how many green lights are valid... if you hit them all, then you have your answer
 Astrobytes: Imnewhelp: stop talking rubbish and interrupting
 Imnewhelp:&#160;???
 PatrickMcGinnisII: time=dist/spd
 Imnewhelp: oh wait
 Imnewhelp: are we on diffrent code servers lol
 Imnewhelp: sorry lol
 jacek: its global chat ~
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think he meant to type in his clash chat
 Imnewhelp: :joy:
 Imnewhelp: sorry guys
 AntiSquid: it's ok
 AntiSquid: just stop playing clash
 Astrobytes: np, just be careful in future
 Imnewhelp: sure bye guys
 AntiSquid: hold up
 AntiSquid: play some multis
 Imnewhelp: whats multis
 Imnewhelp: im like 9
 PatrickMcGinnisII: determine an easy way to see if car hits the green window is easily done with (int)(tryingspeed/lightduration/lightduration)%2==0 then car went thru on a green light
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops messed up formula
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: make sure to tag AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra in your replies or it'll get lost in random chat
 Imnewhelp: looks like fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lightdistance/tryingspeed/lightspeed
 Imnewhelp: how long have you guys been playing this game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra make sure to convert the values appropriately km to m and h to s
 Imnewhelp: i wouldnt call it a game, its more like a torture chamber until you gett gud
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: yeap, I did, but I think my approach was not correct I found a web page which has  a fair explanation
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, still screwd up formula
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i meant lightduration instead of lightspeed
 Astrobytes: don't do that in an important physics calculation :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra the puzzle is pretty easy, it's like 20 lines
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: did you solved it already?
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.xarg.org/puzzle/codingame/aneo-sponsored-puzzle/">https://www.xarg.org/puzzle/codingame/aneo-sponsored-puzzle/</a>
 Astrobytes: Wasn't there a common pitfall involving decimal places or something?
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I found this solution
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I think my approach was incorrect, I didnt think that much
 Astrobytes: Well, it's not the best idea to look for full solutions before you solve it
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: yeah, I know but I havent seen the solution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes yes, that's why multiplying the inputs by 3600 makes the intdiv work to determine odd (red light) versus even (green light)
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: so somebody might be able to help me
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: to explain it
 Astrobytes: gotcha PatrickMcGinnisII
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: please
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't say much more without giving it away
 PatrickMcGinnisII: loop from maxspeed down to 1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in each loop, sim the car ... hit a red light...then that speed isn't a solution
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: Ok, I think I was thinking about a linear solution but  it is different
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: I will do the drawing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there are prolly a 100 different solutions, each lang. delas with prcision differently
 PatrickMcGinnisII: deals w/ precision..i can't type
 AnaPaulinaRamirezSierra: ok, got it. I need to practice more my analytical skills
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ashketchum made sure board is basically 63 bits, so the simple ways of determining a win with bitwise operations takes some head scratching
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sorry working on connect 4
 Neumann: CGBenchmark has been fixed to work with the new APIs&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/releases/tag/1.2.0">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/releases/tag/1.2.0</a>
 jacek: connect4 eh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need 72 bits, I only have 63 :cry:
 jacek: why 72 bits?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need a 0 row to prevent false positives.... so 8x9
 jacek: use some masks
 Astrobytes: thx Neumann
 PatrickMcGinnisII: *sigh*, storing the board in 3 64 bit ints is ok, but the easy ways to test for a win become more complex
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can do it in 2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the 3rd is basically p0|p1 anyways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;-- talks to himself in chat apparently
 jacek: welp 63 bits is ideal for bitboard stuff
 jacek: you only needs 2 int64s
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a normal connect 4 board 7x6 would be easier
 Astrobytes: It's not supposed to be easy.
 jacek: but boring. its solved
 jacek: maybe solution isnt within reach in cg constraints, but its very close
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea ok, 2^64 ...heh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2^42 isn't THAT far odd, but yes, there are more online discussions of the normal board
 PatrickMcGinnisII: odd=off
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 jacek: 8x8 is solved
 PatrickMcGinnisII: with an opening book no less
 reCurse: Checkers is solved too and yet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, i see the need to twist it a little
 PatrickMcGinnisII: keeping the width an odd number of columns seems to be an advantage of sorts
 Imnewhelp: imagine having a social life:joy:
 jacek: :scream:
 reCurse: You sound like a quality individual
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "Stay away from my coffee or I'll drink it from your skull"&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol PHP_INT_MAX&lt;&lt;1 = -2 ... fml
 Astrobytes: Honestly Patrick yourPHP  masochism is always impressive.
 Astrobytes: *your PHP
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ((PHP_INT_MAX-1)&lt;&lt;1) = -4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm guessing it's a 2s complement thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, self torture
 Astrobytes: CGSM
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh CG sado masochism, took me sec :joy:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AntiCheap: When will spring game be?
 AntiCheap: I'll need to dehibernate
 Astrobytes: Spring probably.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea i don't feel like doing a breadth first alphabetaminmax with a node limit of 1000, with some quarklike eval ... I'm losing my mind
 Astrobytes: Just use C ffs! Not like you don't know it!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 9^x=1000 anyone know?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depth 3 i guess
 Astrobytes: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i have done 20k nodes on some simple games
 Astrobytes: Honestly man it's an exercise in futility for a lot of multis. Puzzle-wise sure.You might as well be controlling a nuclear reactor with VB
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you're not wrong
 Astrobytes: At least use the fortran compiler we have on here :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: haven't done fortran since like '89
 PatrickMcGinnisII: If I WAS using VB, i would have a loaded gun in my lap
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I like java more than c#
 PatrickMcGinnisII: exercise in futility
 Astrobytes: You are a true mystery.
 Astrobytes: I firmly stand by my CGSM label.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did alot of C++ and ASM graphics back in the day ... I don't wanna pull the boxes of code out just yet
 Astrobytes: Be a helluva lot easier than this torturous process!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess I'm trying to do the same speed improvements with php that I would do with C# anyways
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i could be sloppier with more power
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, you might be triggering me to do the lang. switch on CG, but I still have other php projects going on non-CG
 Astrobytes: Well don't give up PHP! And feel free to use it on puzzles etc but for the love of god help yourself wrt multis&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE-aQO9XD1g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wE-aQO9XD1g</a> seen this yet&#160;? it's 3D too so you can drag and look around
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll prolly see if I can get into wood1 of connect 4, then make sure my Vis. studio still works
 Astrobytes: good!
 AntiSquid: when did connect 4 appear&#160;?
 darkhorse64: last week
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I use eclipse for java, i know that works
 AntiSquid: eclipse? wow unreal
 Astrobytes: Not changed much since Viking AntiSquid :P
 Astrobytes: Eclipse?! I'm gonna label you asa pure BDSM over CGSM if this continues Patrick
 AntiSquid: eclipse is closer to injecting bleach into your veins
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid that YT link is pretty damn kewl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, you use VS for java too?
 AntiSquid: VSC or intellij 
 Astrobytes: IntelliJ or VSCode
 PatrickMcGinnisII: IJ?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh
 AntiSquid: i am not a fan of VS, i get it some people like it ... 
 Astrobytes: IntelliJ is great for java but it's a bit slower than VSC for me, ymmv
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so I should be using Cordova?
 Astrobytes: You what?
 AntiSquid: what do you want to do&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, trying to figure out what plugin i need for android
 jacek: android studio
 jacek: forget cordova :unamused:
 AntiSquid: ya why not android studio&#160;?
 AntiSquid: too popular?
 AntiSquid: phone gap worth trying too btw
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm used to the JDK thru eclipse actually
 jacek: cordova is phonegap
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11b5dd42-b7b2-4279-8417-23c1a73d380a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/11b5dd42-b7b2-4279-8417-23c1a73d380a</a>
 jacek: huh
 AntiSquid: is it? i don't know anymore
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Android Studio only supports java for programming. On the other hand, Eclipse supports C, C++, PHP, Java, Perl, C#, and many other languages as well. ... When it comes to user interface Android Studio is much easier and quicker. Eclipse is not a native Android IDE and thus, is more complicated than Android Eclipse.
 AntiSquid: the why do i find articles titled "Adobe PhoneGap vs Apache Cordova" jacek&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's Apache Cordova now
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Wow, I am into BDSM 
 AntiSquid: so it closed down and got bought&#160;?
 Astrobytes: screenshotted for future reference PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The screen layout looks SOO much easier in AS
 AntiSquid: you can at the very least use kotlin in android studio last i checked 
 AntiSquid: and with some plugins you can use other languages ... 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, yall put me in a google hole
 greencat: test
 greencat: woah
 Astrobytes: Test failed. Abort.
 Scarfield: Astraborts
 Astrobytes: Scabortfield
 Scarfield: any new plans to escape
 Astrobytes: Don't think so, they'd have announced if there were new scenarios I guess
 Scarfield: oh i thought someone mentioned there were new ones available
 Astrobytes: Oh?
 Astrobytes: I still have no access so can't check
 Scarfield: they are no new ones
 Astrobytes: 'there are not' or 'they are not'?
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: there are no new ones available
 Astrobytes: aw fk even I fked it, 'there are no' fml
 MSmits: you're both crap at language
 MSmits: just fyi
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Thanks man
 MSmits: yw :grin:
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Did you try the escape thingy MSmits? I can't remember if you did or not
 MSmits: nope
 Astrobytes: It's kinda fun tbh, you need voice/video though. I did the first one with just text from my end - not good
 MSmits: just submitted my 4th (?) completely rebuilt random rollout just now... hope this does something, prolly not :P
 Astrobytes: A rebuilt random rollout ...
 MSmits: oh teamwork game you mean
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Scarfield: :v: (imagine the fingers crossed)
 MSmits: the worst thing is that most of them get stuck between 5 and 10 or something. So not only did i  fail to improve anything, I dont know which one to continue with :P
 Astrobytes: Sounds like you need: ML!
 jacek: and messing up with the leaderboard
 jacek: my little what?
 MSmits: no thanks, if i do ML it wont be uttt
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: how can there not be a fingers crossed emoticon thing
 Astrobytes: My little problem
 Astrobytes: jacek
 Scarfield: yea i know, its ridicoulus
 Astrobytes: there's also no salt one on here, but discord has it. I feel salty about that :salt:
 MSmits: bot doing reasonably good, but it's probably a lucky streak
 Scarfield: why are we even here. without these emojies whats the point
 Astrobytes: Life is meaningless.
 MSmits: life is empty without a screaming cat
 jacek: :soccer:
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 Scarfield: wait there is always "xD" aahh im happy again
 Astrobytes: :scream_cat:
 Astrobytes: Here he comes to save the day. EeeeecksDee is on his wayyyy
 Astrobytes: (Mighty Mouse reference)
 MSmits: ohh yeah i remember that
 MSmits: yellow cape right
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/T0HLAKm1_1Q?t=2">https://youtu.be/T0HLAKm1_1Q?t=2</a> xD
 Scarfield: no idea what this is
 MSmits: ahh not his cape, the rest is yellow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :beer:
 Astrobytes: It was a cartoon about a... well, like a super mouse
 MSmits: it was good
 MSmits: i liked it
 Astrobytes: iirc it was quite funny
 MSmits: bah i was doing so well. now getting wrecked by re curse NN
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 MSmits: wish i could do proper benchmarking
 MSmits: but cg bench not working
 jacek: it is now
 MSmits: really how?
 MSmits: new release?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/releases/tag/1.2.0">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/releases/tag/1.2.0</a>
 MSmits: yay
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: my new bot has 60-70k rollouts
 MSmits: much heavier though
 Astrobytes: Yeah was about 8pm or thereabouts he posted the update in here
 MSmits: he did that fast
 Astrobytes: Don't think it was a particularly difficult thing to fix, something about the JSON response returning the result object as the root (you've seen JSON responses)
 MSmits: i've seen loads of texty stuff if thats what you mean
 MSmits: thats professional jargon btw
 Astrobytes: lol yeah, but the hierarchy/format of the JSON response.
 MSmits: not lately
 MSmits: but i'm totally ok with that
 Astrobytes: Before there was some other shit before you got to the actual result of your API request
 MSmits: they removed the :poop:&#160;?
 MSmits: no more jobby in the json?
 Astrobytes: Didn't check, probably just moved it
 Astrobytes: OMG
 Astrobytes:  jobby in the json
 Astrobytes: Actually spat out my tea
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Well played
 MSmits: i have a bad memory for some things, but I can do fairly well with poopywords
 Astrobytes: I think that's a male thing
 Scarfield: looking forward to the chat word image from euler with a super large  "jobby"
 MSmits: hmm maybe
 MSmits: yeah i noticed my wife is not into poop
 Astrobytes: I refuse to ask why or how you found this out.
 MSmits: better not
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: :rofl:
 MSmits: my submit: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/msmits</a>
 MSmits: I think it's an improvement. I did a complete rewrite of sim, so tons of room for experimentation
 MSmits: wrecked by re curse, but its hard to draw conclusions from that
 Astrobytes: Definitely hitting the wall wrt reBless, tomatoes is giving you a run for your money
 MSmits: 50% tomatoes
 MSmits: bad run vs vingte though
 MSmits: he definitely improved
 Astrobytes: I'd be more concerned about fixing that 50%
 reCurse: Why don't you spam submit that version then for a change :P
 Astrobytes: initially
 MSmits: hmm, i kinda owe it to you dont I reCurse
 MSmits: one more should do it maybe?
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: another submit incoming
 reCurse: Tempting to resubmit
 MSmits: dont 
 MSmits: I will fix it
 MSmits: you'll be nr 1 for a little while
 reCurse: Nah but I can get higher by resubmitting
 reCurse: More games vs you :P
 MSmits: more than if i spam&gt;/
 AntiSquid: submit wars?
 reCurse: Yeah because then I get games vs kar too
 Astrobytes: Get a room you two :P
 MSmits: ohh
 reCurse: Alright F it
 reCurse: Let's do it live
 MSmits: I think my new bot is much stronger vs lower ranked players than all the other ones i had
 Astrobytes: eSports!
 AntiSquid: good stream opportunity, just add some trash talking, throw some dirt at each other
 reCurse: There's a million other better options for that
 Wontonimo: well, whatever you are doing is causing me to go up in rank, so keep it coming
 MSmits: probably random though
 Astrobytes: that's usually not a good thing unless you're top 5
 Scarfield: one day there will be an anime about your uttt rivalry
 reCurse: CG anime
 reCurse: There's enough material for a couple of seasons without fillers
 MSmits: I don't feel that much rivalry with re curse atm because I'm like rank 4-5 atm
 Astrobytes: More of a classic kung-fu movie I think
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxCukwjjhhg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxCukwjjhhg</a>
 Astrobytes: You beat my beloved master and adopted his techniques!
 Wontonimo: I really think there is a rock-paper-scissors  with the bots going on, and trueskill doesn't capture that there are different flavours.  It's a fairly basic machine learning problem that is similar to learning user preferences or a recommendation system
 AntiSquid: Scarfield <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://averagejoe351213450.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/inuyashiki-header.jpg">https://averagejoe351213450.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/inuyashiki-header.jpg</a>
 reCurse: There's also a fairly basic solution, optimize wrt pair winrates
 reCurse: Trueskill is very ill suited for bot ranking
 reCurse: Yet everyone does it for some reason
 MSmits: Wontonimo there is a rock paper scissors going on, but it's actually much worse in other games
 Scarfield: lol squid
 MSmits: not doing as poorly against you this time around reCurse
 Wontonimo: MSmits all the more reason to promote a solution.  If we had tennis players, wouldn't we keep track of (or calculate from probabilities) left and right handed?
 reCurse: It's ok it's my best chance at 2 minutes of glory
 MSmits: Wontonimo this has been discussed soooo often. there's no point to it now
 reCurse: Fighting this system is too frustrating
 reCurse: If this community wasn't dying I'd make alternative leaderboards
 Astrobytes: There are ways of calculating more reasonably
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, what reCurse said
 reCurse: Parse new matches every hour and compute new leaderboard every day
 Wontonimo: haha MSmits , just cuz i'm late to the game, doesn't mean I get to miss out on giving my 0.02 .  That said, i get it, we got we got
 MSmits: i accept that the rankings are flawed and that rank is onyl accurate between two bots with obviously different strengths
 MSmits: Wontonimo sure, didn't mean to silence you on this
 MSmits: just trying not to give you false hope this will be fixed
 Wontonimo: all good dude
 Astrobytes: reCurse: The community isn't dying it's just cg seems hell bent on killing it
 reCurse: No it's dying let's be honest
 Wontonimo: which community?
 reCurse: Not nearly as much activity from the 5% as there used to be
 Astrobytes: Yes but the reason is
 AntiSquid: he's talking about us Wontonimo
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: i consider myself still young though
 Astrobytes: euler's inactivity made me quite sad
 Scarfield: ^
 reCurse: I was surprised he sticked around so long after
 Wontonimo: i feel like i missed out by not joining 2 years ago
 reCurse: I don't nearly put as much in as he does
 reCurse: I'd be frankly disgusted
 MSmits: Wontonimo try not to get too discouraged. There is no better platform for botting out there still... afaik
 Astrobytes: Yeah you're not wrong there reCurse
 AntiSquid: what happened to euler? wasn't around much lately
 Astrobytes: It's beyond a slap in the face/kick in the teeth
 MSmits: he designed a contest 
 reCurse: Think he got fed up being played like a violin for months trying to get his community contest in
 MSmits: but never happened
 reCurse: Only to get the abysmal response CG gave
 AntiSquid: aaaah that, i was surprised they wouldn't accept a ready made game to fill in an empty downtime
 reCurse: Gotta get those juicy numbers twice a year
 Astrobytes: I mean that was ready since last end of summer/beginning of autumn (fall you heathens) right?
 Astrobytes: TryAngle Catch I mean
 AntiSquid: don't think it helps retention, but i don't have all the stats
 reCurse: I think the clashers are the audience they're going for
 reCurse: Well soon they'll get what they want
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 Wontonimo: honestly, i thought this was mostly a job recruitment site that just tolerated the top&#160;% players who are just doing it for fun and not recruitment.  So personally, I'm super impressed that they pay for all this cloud compute that doesn't really feed their core business
 reCurse: I am very thankful for the years of fun
 reCurse: I am very frustrated with how it ends
 reCurse: End of story
 Astrobytes: It's kinda built on the community, or has been these days, and the reason we've supported them is because they've done all this.
 Andriamanitra: i'm sure they would like this to be a recruitment site because that would make money
 Andriamanitra: but i'm not convinced anyone is getting recruited here :D
 Astrobytes: Now, it's a different feeling.
 AntiSquid: are you looking for a job here Wontonimo&#160;?
 Wontonimo: hey hey ... reCurse did you change your bot or just resubmit?  if change, mind sharing?
 reCurse: They have a very different side of business we don't see
 reCurse: Same bot
 reCurse: When I complain about the broken rankings
 Astrobytes: CG for Work is separate
 reCurse: I'm not fucking kidding
 Wontonimo: AntiSquid no, i'm happy with my job
 reCurse: They are broken as hell
 Astrobytes: that's the same one reCurse?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: well... not everyone feels the same way about this. I  do think it is sad that they removed community contests, but it wasnt the main fun for me
 reCurse: Exact code
 Astrobytes: ffs lol
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: karlisos bot does very well against some subtop players
 MSmits: better than recurse
 MSmits: so when they submit...
 reCurse: There is no excuse
 AntiSquid: contests are the most active time
 Wontonimo: HAHA
 reCurse: I have 65-70% vs him, I don't care if he 100% the rest
 MSmits: i had a bot for a long time that had 25% vs karliso and 50% vs you
 Astrobytes: Perhaps they never really factored in the fact that people would write such competitive bots - or perhaps they just never bothered updating it accordingly :thinking:
 MSmits: reCurse thats not fair though, you're saying you want RPS to make you win, but not when ti makes you lose 
 reCurse: Ok let me rephrase
 AntiSquid: even OOC was fun, didn't like the game itself, but it's the event and how it plays out and the chatting and ranting and debugging and complaints and the memes ....
 reCurse: There is no world in which you have &gt;65% against all top bots
 reCurse: And you're not rank 1
 Astrobytes: No he's saying it's nonsense
 reCurse: There is no justification
 Scarfield: and ceg asking about the rules
 MSmits: i can give 1, sort of
 MSmits: what if there's only 1 clear rival
 reCurse: I can fit an elo curve on winrates if you give me 24 hours to batch it
 MSmits: and having &gt;50&#160;% against everyone else is trivial
 reCurse: It's a joke
 MSmits: you migth RPS that rival
 AntiSquid: ceg "speed runs", save time on reading statement Scarfield
 MSmits: does that mean your bot is better?
 reCurse: If you have a significant positive winrate against every bot
 reCurse: You are number 1
 reCurse: End of story
 reCurse: I can document all the ways the system is broken
 AntiSquid: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: allright, so what if they did a round of games where all the top 10 playeed 10 games against the other 9
 MSmits: do you think you would win that?
 MSmits: if all games counted equal
 MSmits: because I doubt that
 reCurse: Low sampling means there is a probability distribution
 Astrobytes: There was a reason for pb's alternative scoring in BR (and in subsequent contests)
 MSmits: ok 1000 games then
 reCurse: So let's say I have 70% vs the rest
 reCurse: And he 100% the rest
 Astrobytes: *(and grpahs in subsequent contests)
 reCurse: But I 70% him
 reCurse: You're fine saying I'm number 2
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: yes
 MSmits: because RPS
 MSmits: what if he changes 1 parameter
 reCurse: I don't know what to say. It's pure nonsense.
 MSmits: and your 70% becomes 40%
 MSmits: maybe thats the case
 MSmits: RPs is fickle
 reCurse: What kind of hypothetical scenario is that
 MSmits: seen it happen a lot
 reCurse: It's not about what could be
 reCurse: It's about what the winrates *are*
 struct: But what would your win rate vs the rest be?
 MSmits: yes but you are making your own definition
 reCurse: I just exaggerated in his favor the current scenario happening
 reCurse: And you still think it's fine
 MSmits: I know
 reCurse: So it's kind of mindboggling to me
 MSmits: you are choosing a particular definition of *best bot*
 MSmits: i am not defending the trueskill system btw
 reCurse: Someone saying a bot that wins significantly above everyone else doesn't get rank 1
 MSmits: i am just not certain its fair to say karlisos bot is weaker overall
 reCurse: To me it's like 1+1=3
 reCurse: I don't know how and why I should debate that
 struct: Which rating system would not place you second in the example you provided?
 reCurse: An elo curve fitted against pairwise winrates
 Astrobytes: (which is also, I may add, asking the impossible on CG)
 MSmits: but you yourself said it's important that a bot is generalized well. 
 Wontonimo: trueskill has both win chance and fickleness of win built in.  With these two factors all sorts of weirdness come out.
 MSmits: isn't karlisos bot generalized better if he does well against everione except your deterministic nn
 reCurse: You think a better generalization is better winrates against bots you dominate while losing significantly to a rival bot
 MSmits: no, i think it needs to all be taken into account
 MSmits: and i think RPS is a bad judge of bot strength
 reCurse: It's not RPS
 MSmits: why not, i tried like 5 completely different bots against karliso
 MSmits: i even have had 55% winrate vs you 
 AntiSquid: well continuous games would fix this even at large intervals
 MSmits: with one of them
 reCurse: You don't need continuous games
 MSmits: none of them got over 30% vs karliso
 reCurse: You just need to fit historical data
 Wontonimo: once i found the score was trueskill, i change my strategy to try and target more consistent results and really make sure I don't lose against much lower (and also it can hurt to win against much higher)
 Wontonimo: i don't think that's the case with your bot reCurse cuz it just wins as far as i can tell ... so your uncertainly should be near zero
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/reCurse">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-tic-tac-toe/reCurse</a>
 MSmits: looks very  much rps to me
 MSmits: look at that insane winrate vs karliso
 reCurse: Can we please not look at submit results
 reCurse: And instead rely on big batches
 jacek: and little vs jacek
 reCurse: I've had 75 games 55% winrate batches turn into 68% at 250 games
 MSmits: it's small sure... but still... 30-6
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: It's a bit sad you feel you have to actually change your approach purely based on the scoring algorithm
 MSmits: yeah i would not do that
 reCurse: I don't have 83% on a large batch
 reCurse: So I won't debate that
 AntiSquid: i'd expect to be 1st with win rates like that tbh
 MSmits: no i know, but you do not have much difference between winrates vs karliso and other players
 MSmits: right/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: he;s sooo much stronger than everyone else. Only your bot has this experience
 MSmits: which is quite the achievement to be sure
 MSmits: not debating that
 reCurse: You're assuming RPS when it could be unexplored transitivity
 MSmits: what that?
 Astrobytes: Transitivity that has not currently been explored.
 reCurse: The opposite of RPS is perfect transitivity right?
 AntiSquid: no i mean recurz got better win rates on that magugeek site, or am i missing something?
 MSmits: sure ok
 reCurse: But all you have is few data points at the top with a very large distance
 MSmits: yeah thats the main problem, the two guys at the top are far ahead
 reCurse: With more diversified top bots you could still find it's not RPS at all
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: if we had more bots of that strength, we could know for sure
 reCurse: So I don't know why you assume RPS when there's no strong evidence for it
 Astrobytes: Do some alt submits
 MSmits: I don';t assume, i think it;s possible, even likely because of my experience with various bots submitting. But I cant assume
 AntiSquid: oh ya flood UTTT with clones&#160;! :D
 Astrobytes: No, not clones. I mean meaningfully different but strong bots.
 MSmits: various bots benchmarking i mean
 Astrobytes: "Multiplayer is a zoo" right
 AntiSquid: right, but some animals live in large colonies
 Astrobytes: don't get OT
 Astrobytes: Nah I can't make head nor tail of that UTTT leaderboard really.
 Just_Spark: I can't understand clashincode game xD
 AntiSquid: well then ... that's end of the road
 Just_Spark: xd
 AntiSquid: omega_xD&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol pushed papyjo out of wood2 connect4 with a depth 1
 Astrobytes: You're supposed to push yourself out of wood 2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its deoth 1
 Wontonimo: i think i may just start a metagame of trying to make a bot good enough to push players out of wood league in games but purposefully lose agains the boss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i win against boss, but not players
 PatrickMcGinnisII: boss is pretty dumb
 struct: If you do it in CSB, its similar to DDOS
 Wontonimo: eventually they'll get auto-promoted and only leave you and the bot
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII the boss is supposed to be a weak bar of entry
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 Astrobytes: anyway, goodnight/goodbye all, laters
 struct: gn
 MSmits: gn Astrobytes
 reCurse: :wave:
 Wontonimo: laters Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: gn8
 Wontonimo: it's only 6pm dude (timezone lol)
 MSmits: midnight here&#160;:)
 MSmits: In Dutchieland
 Scarfield: gn
 Wontonimo: so, 90% away approximately
 AntiSquid: are you leaving too Scarfield&#160;?
 MSmits: 90%&#160;?
 struct: Just make unbeatable bot, problem solved
 Scarfield: nono, just a little late to say gn to sleepstrobytes
 Wontonimo: if you tell me how high the moon rises off the horizon then I can get a rough estimate of long and lat from my position
 Wontonimo: actually, no, i'm too lazy the to the math
 Wontonimo: 90 degrees
 Wontonimo: not&#160;%
 Wontonimo: there really should be a degree symbol on the keyboard
 MSmits: yeah i dont have it either
 AntiSquid: there is, you just have wrong keyboard / layout
 AntiSquid: not on mine either btw
 Wontonimo: (waves fist)
 milad-mehri: °
 milad-mehri: there is no key
 milad-mehri: use alt codes
 Wontonimo: or spoon apparently
 AntiSquid: you have it on german keyboards <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_keyboard_layout">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_keyboard_layout</a>
 AntiSquid: top left
 Wontonimo: hmm .. how much damage has all these resubmits caused me on uttt ...
 MSmits: your 31 rank would be worth top 20 a year ago and top 10 the year before that
 MSmits: uttt has evolved a lot
 Wontonimo: that's what i gets for being late to the party
 MSmits: nagrarok was nr 1 for over a year i think
 MSmits: now 16
 MSmits: same bot
 reCurse: Booking doesn't age well
 Wontonimo: i also get some lessons learnt from trail blazers and community support
 MSmits: I do you really think he booked so much? I never noticed it
 reCurse: Not nearly as much as those coming after
 MSmits: maybe because he didnt counterbook me personally
 reCurse: I meant booking, counterbooking is more specific and harder
 reCurse: To detect
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: well booking doesnt even help that much
 MSmits: regular books i mean in uttt
 reCurse: I'm speculating btw, haven't had official confirmation/deny
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i noticed the counterbooks when i pitted you, karliso and miarem against eachother in my IDE and saw the same games for 15-20 plies. Identical every time :P
 MSmits: of course could be other reasons... but not likely :0
 reCurse: True
 Wontonimo: that just seems kinda cheap ... and tempting
 MSmits: tell me about it
 Wontonimo: not my speed though
 MSmits: they created a monster by doing that :P
 Wontonimo: i'd get a lot more satisfaction from having an algo that wins vs it than just hardcode something
 MSmits: its no longer done much in uttt now though
 MSmits: dont worry about it
 MSmits: the thing is, counterbooking makes you vulnerable to counterbooking
 MSmits: by counterbooking, you're making yourself deterministic
 MSmits: it's selfdefeating, unless it's perfect play 
 Wontonimo: if i was gonna attack such a thing, my kneejerk would be to deep train offline for that config, and apply it as a soft heuristic like i do with teccles heuristic.  It isn't deterministic in my algo.
 Wontonimo: but ... now thinking of it, i can't see how it wouldn't be deterministic and open to counter attack
 Wontonimo: okay, point taken
 MSmits: if you apply teccles only in the early game it's pretty much perfect play
 MSmits: i cant prove that, but i've seen enough to think thats the case
 Scarfield: just dont google it, apparently :p
 MSmits: lol
 Wontonimo: at least from my basement bathroom
 reCurse: Counterbooking doesn't necessarily imply deterministic
 reCurse: You could make it next level with generic counterbooking
 MSmits: that's true i guess
 Wontonimo: hmm ... this refactoring to not have the whole board copied in each node is proving time consuing
 MSmits: worth it though
 MSmits: you will have more space
 MSmits: can even do tree reuse then
 MSmits: i am assuming you currently dont reuse
 MSmits: with those huge nodes
 Wontonimo: no reduce / reuse / recycle here
 struct: Also storing the current game state every time can be expensive in the long run
 struct: Especially when you dont need it
 MSmits: what most of us do is have 20-30 million node pool, when you apply a move, you select the child as the new root, then when the opponent plays a move, you search that new root for the move and make the new child the root. then you continue searching
 MSmits: the new turn will have a large tree as a base already
 MSmits: it's probably about 10% of the original tree. Still helps
 MSmits: with a small exploration, it could be much more or less, more if your opponent plays what you expect
 Wontonimo: oh, i do reuse the tree from the last turn and search for the opponent move
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: but then you probably run out of nodes?
 MSmits: or maybe not if you dont have that many rollouts
 Wontonimo: i don't pre-allocate nodes.  I tried that yesterday after talking and got the segmentation violation blues ... with small nodes it'll be okay
 Valdez001: hi
 MSmits: yeah it will be
 MSmits: preallocating nodes will help a ton
 struct: you create nodes every expansion?
 MSmits: also, why not reset your tree when you run out?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wood1, puke\
 MSmits: just check at the beginning of your turn if you're near the end of your pool and reset it
 Wontonimo: also, i tried to allocate on the stack. ... which is the wrong place.  so, that's an easy fix
 MSmits: you'll lose the tree, but thats fine
 Wontonimo: struct yes i create nodes as i need them
 struct: I wonder how big the performance penalty is
 Wontonimo: dinner calls!  later
 MSmits: gtg as well. GN!
 struct: gn
 Wontonimo: oh, and my nodes contain a whole board each
 Wontonimo: atm
 Scarfield: gn gn
 Guillermo.: hello world
 Wendys: yes
 Wendys: hello mr guillermo
 Guillermo.: who are you mr wendys
 Guillermo.: you are beautiful
 Wendys: yes
 Just_Spark: I'M DONE WITH THIS GAME 'Power of Thor'
 Wontonimo: and by done, do you mean you KILLED IT?
 middleverse: am i doing something wrong, it's printing nothing
 middleverse: am i suppose to return
 middleverse: or am i suppose to print()
 Wontonimo: pint
 Wontonimo: print
 TheBrutalKnight_e654: Print
 Wontonimo: (after the pint)
 Wontonimo: what lang are you using middleverse&#160;?
 middleverse: gotcha 
 middleverse: thanks it worked
 middleverse: python
 Wontonimo: you can also print to standard error using print("debug",file=sys.stderr,flush=True)
 Wontonimo: in python.  The standard error will be displayed in the output but won't be considered part of your solution.  it's really handy for debugging
 YodaLightsabr: python is eas
 YodaLightsabr: y
 YodaLightsabr: why not do something more challenging
 YodaLightsabr: like JavaScript?
 Notgoodatcoding5: Hi
 YodaLightsabr: python has a lot of built in functions
 YodaLightsabr: oh wait
 YodaLightsabr: wrong chat tab
 YodaLightsabr: lmfao
 Andriamanitra: as if javascript didn't have a lot of built-in functions :p

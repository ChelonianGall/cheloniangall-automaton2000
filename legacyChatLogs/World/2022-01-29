 dmuraco: yooooo
 Blokops: heu
 Blokops: hey
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: do you mean the angle coming off the checkpoint in respect to the pod?
 Blokops: like instead of 334 give -26
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: the pod angle goes +180 clockwise and - 180 to counter-clockwise with respect to the front of the pod, how are you calculating that 334?
 Blokops: angle = math.atan2(next_checkpoint_y_1 - y1, next_checkpoint_x_1 - x1)
 Wontonimo: if (angle &gt; 180) angle = 360 - angle
 Wontonimo: oops , that's not right
 Wontonimo: if (angle &gt; 180) angle = angle - 360
 Blokops: yup that did it
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: wintonimo is right
 Blokops: was trying to find when the y was lower than the ship y, if the  flip
 Blokops: i guess i was overcomplociating
 Blokops: but at least i got the distance form ship to check by accident
 dmuraco: facts he right
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: are you trying to calculate an offset to correct drifting trajectory?
 Blokops: if angle &gt;90 speed = 0
 Blokops: it took me this far 
 Blokops: no idea why the took it away in gold
 Wontonimo: hey Blokops, you may find micro tests really help for these kinds of things.  Here is an example SO response that uses inline micro tests well <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148</a>
 Wontonimo: it would have really helped with making your angle calculator and verified that it worked as expected
 Blokops: sort of like building it in parts
 Wontonimo: +1
 Wontonimo: the brilliant thing about these kinds of micro tests being inline with your code is that they run once when your program starts up to verify right away if everything is as you expect.  No sifting through replays or logging output
 Wontonimo: or trying to get that one tricky situation to be recreated in a playback
 Blokops: gold league is full of dead programs
 Wontonimo: yes, it sure is
 Wontonimo: you can get well ahead in gold just by un-deading your bot
 Blokops: next step is to make one of the pod crash with the competition
 Wontonimo: and for that i'd suggest,
 Wontonimo: if the opponents lead is going for an even numbered checkpoint, then move to intercept and ram.  else, rush ahead to the next even checkpoint to get ahead of them
 Wontonimo: otherwise, you'll just follow behind them constantly 
 Wontonimo: also, camping is a good strategy as well as detecting an upcoming collision and using shields
 Wontonimo: 20 fake internet points for the first person to say what "Tron" stands for
 Blokops: wasn't tron a antivirus
 Blokops: tool or device
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: Google says The Real-time Operating system Nucleus
 OverInstitutionalizedApe: But all i could think of was the movie
 Wontonimo: tron = Trace On.  its an assembly debugging command
 Wontonimo: sorry, BASIC not assembly
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRON_command#:~:text=TRON%20is%20a%20debugging%20command,BASIC%20GOTO%20and%20GOSUB%20statements">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRON_command#:~:text=TRON%20is%20a%20debugging%20command,BASIC%20GOTO%20and%20GOSUB%20statements</a>.
 Wontonimo: 4 fake points to Blokops for identifying it is a tool.  3 fake points to OverInstitutionalizedApe for the movie reference

 Mortis_666: wow
 Mortis_666: cool
 Wontonimo: I commented on your WIP Blabbage.  Nice write up
 Blabbage: Thx
 Wontonimo: I always find reverse hard
 Wontonimo: oh, in the output you have the text "distance" ... what about French&#160;?
 Wontonimo: The word "distance" in the output really helps with reverse mode
 Wontonimo:&#160;:+1:
 Blabbage: Yeah, i recently changed to make reverse better
 Blabbage: So distance in output and only 3 types of emergencies
 Blabbage: either "Alarm", "Emergency", or "Priority"
 Blabbage: But as you write in your comment, you can disregard the words, I made this for the shortest mode
 Wontonimo: i've been thinking about adding extra flavour text to the input to help also.  Things like hints that are not needed to solve the problem but provide clues to the programmer if they are stuck.  Seems like you where thinking along the same lines
 Wontonimo: but for output
 Wontonimo: cool
 Blabbage: Yeah, I also love when the progression of the inputs helps you out
 Wontonimo: I think this will be challenging for C/C#/C++ having an unequal number of elements per line of alarm
 Wontonimo: maybe i'm too noob in those to know of a simple split command
 Blabbage: ok, didn't think about that, I thought it should be no prob in C# though
 DSG_prozkillz: hey
 Blabbage: dealing with arbitrary length input in one line was to complicate the shortest mode
 DSG_prozkillz: is there anyone with high authority here?
 Blabbage: I have very limited C/C++ knowledge
 Blabbage: But I will look into it
 Wontonimo: there is the cin call to read in white space separated tokens and do automatic conversion to primitive data types.
 Wontonimo: that works great when you know ahead of time how many tokens there are per line
 Wontonimo: anyone here know an easy way to process variable number of tokens per line in C / C++&#160;?
 Blabbage: ok... I think I should change it then...
 Wontonimo: not so fast, I'm no C/C++ expert
 Blabbage:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: maybe there is a quick and easy way 
 Blabbage: saw this:  char * strtok ( char * str, const char * delimiters );
 BlaiseEbuth: Quick and easy way for&#160;?
 Blabbage: Split an input string by e.g. space
 BlaiseEbuth: a stringstream
 Blabbage: like "1 2 3", however the length can be arbitrary
 Blabbage: So e.g. "1 2 3" but sometimes "1 2"
 BlaiseEbuth: Something like that Blabbage <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/ID9At4m">https://tech.io/snippet/ID9At4m</a>
 Blabbage: Works 
 Blabbage: nice, the reason for asking is my contribution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/8002ea73cdd5181a43df0d92f716b186209e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/8002ea73cdd5181a43df0d92f716b186209e</a>

 Astrobytes: (no. speak english please)
 struct: wht language is this?
 Astrobytes: Greek
 MSmits: I only speak Geek
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 jacek: :nerd:
 MSmits: sup
 MSmits: I've been a bit too busy for CG is why i am not around much btw
 MSmits: covid giving me lots of extra work
 struct: im still waiting for your NN
 MSmits: so am I&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: so is Smits
 Astrobytes: lol dammit
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: well at least I have a ridiculous amount of data to train on.
 MSmits: from having a meta mcts running for weeks
 MSmits: I plan a test and half my students are home with covid or quarantine
 jacek: youll solve the game sooner than youll get NN working
 jacek: at this point it wont matter
 jacek: except for compressing into CG limit
 MSmits: it's not really solvable the way i am going about it though
 MSmits: if i used the endgame book program and rented some cpu, i could solve it
 struct: hmm
 MSmits: but i stopped at 36 and instead went at it from the other direction (starting at starting board)
 MSmits: that wont solve it because of loops
 struct: how many seeds is it in total?
 MSmits: 48
 struct: how long did 36 take you?
 MSmits: 3 weeks, but it is very exponential. The last 2 seeds is like 80% of that time
 MSmits: 60 GB of storage for the 36 seed states
 struct: ok, this would get expensive really fast
 MSmits: 36 seed book is nearly 15 GB, 35 seed is 11 GB
 MSmits: i mean just the 36 seed states
 MSmits: total book is 60 GB so far
 MSmits: 37 would be over 20 GB
 MSmits: but the main probably is I need to hold a lot of it in RAM during solving
 MSmits: main problem
 struct: just get a 512 GB ram server
 MSmits: I *only* have 32 GB ram
 MSmits: I could use HD space, but that is so slow, it would be half a year to just do 37 seeds
 MSmits: some French mathematician solved it I think
 MSmits: In practice I can pretty reasonably say I know what lines of play lead to a draw and be pretty certain the opening move 5 leads to draw
 struct: damn there are machines with 3TB of ram
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 struct: I wonder what uses so much ram
 MSmits: what i do now i use the meta mcts lines of play to select states from the endgame book. I can easily get millions of those and train on them. The work is mostly in getting a bot working that uses it. To make it easy for myself I should try to adapt marchetes work
 struct: im going to try to learn it again
 struct: only way to progress on bt
 MSmits: learn nn in general or the azero system marchete shared?
 struct: nn in general
 MSmits: ah ok, i think i have to basics on that. Just havent used it for anything in CG
 MSmits: dont know the azero system very well though
 MSmits: just the idea of it
 MSmits: lucky submit, got past recurse&#160;:)
 MSmits: this is just my plain old bot with a early game opening book
 MSmits: (&gt;= 37 seeds)
 jacek: recurse now seems just low level boos
 jacek: boss even
 MSmits: yeah, seems to be, but his bot is still miles ahead of anyone not a NN
 MSmits: like +5 rating
 MSmits: this leaderboard is starting to be like csb (mad pod racing), where at the top every few ranks it's a totally new league
 jacek: and every top is nn
 MSmits: almost, yes, i got into top 10 now though :P
 MSmits: once i convert my bot, dark horse has the honor of being the best non-nn on the board
 jacek: dark horse? you meant darkhorse64&#160;?
 MSmits: yes sure, ping him why not&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: best old school bot, :fireworks:
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: I wonder if tric and yurko are still old school
 MSmits: if they aren't, then their bots are only a little better than before, or the submits shifted them
 jacek: astro seems also old school
 MSmits: yeah I think so. He has a very strong bot. I think he spent an uncharacteristically long time on this one
 MSmits: tweaking it
 MSmits: Before when there were only 3 NN's, we spend weeks discussing eval and such, trying to beat you guys
 MSmits: spent
 jacek: but everything changed when the fire nation attacked
 MSmits: is that what Marchete is called now?
 jacek: maybe
 Astrobytes: I could still rewrite that Oware bot but it's a lot of work

 IanRaa: hi
 IanRaa: anyone could help me here
 IanRaa: regarding Mad Pod Racing
 IanRaa: should be simple one, but I don't get it how to find out coordinates for x, y 
 5DN1L: What kind of help do you need?
 jacek: just ask the question ~
 IanRaa: I see position of target 1
 IanRaa: but how should I know where it is on the screen
 e_fishel: does coc give xp?
 5DN1L: coc don't give xp; associated achievements do
 IanRaa: I mean if pod is to move towards target one for the beginning 
 IanRaa: I need to determine it's x,y position 
 IanRaa: guess like pixels position of the screen
 jacek: click on the gear icon under the screen and turn debug on
 IanRaa: ok
 MACKEYTH: I need some tips for 9x9 Atari Go.
 MACKEYTH: I've got a depth 2 minimax algorithm set up. It can beat the Wood 4 boss sometimes, but not consistently
 jacek: do you know flood fill algorithm
 jacek: oh
 jacek: what is your eval
 jacek: i use simple my_score - his_score
 MACKEYTH: Me too.
 darkhorse64: Only through achievements and quest map
 darkhorse64: oops scroll
 jacek: and i get 3-4 plies in the beginning
 MACKEYTH: I was thinking about adding a heuristic involving free fields around enemy groups for simulations with no captures
 MACKEYTH: I'm not good with minimax. Uncertain to apply it to more than 2 plies, or how to prune.
 jacek: pure minimax or alphabeta?
 MACKEYTH: Wikipedia article was a bit opaque for me.
 MACKEYTH: pure minimax for right now. I couldn't figure out a good pruning heuristic
 jacek: alphabeta is universal, it prunes a lot without any heuristic. it just prunes more with good move ordering
 jacek: but in go, for about 20 first turns, i completely ignore edges moves
 MACKEYTH: I haven't incorporated any traditional starting strategy.
 Astrobytes: alpha and beta are dynamic score bounds, anything outside the range of alpha-beta can be pruned (essentially)
 MACKEYTH: I think I read somewhere that creating groups around the dots being a strong opening.
 MACKEYTH: My bot just makes random moves until it detects possible captures
 MACKEYTH: My first attempt was a MCTS, but it was only getting single-digit rollouts.
 MACKEYTH: Calculating all legal moves for a given board state is pretty time consuming
 jacek: go in CG constraints is very consuming
 jacek: UTTT is better for mcts training
 jacek: but if already know minimax, alphabeta is next step to learn
 Astrobytes: ^
 MACKEYTH: I read the wikipedia article on alpha-beta, but didn't really get it
 MACKEYTH: Know of a more beginner-friendly resource?
 Wontonimo: hey MSmits , did i read that correctly that you have a NN bot out there&#160;?
 Rebollo: guys is is possible to use some kind of EVAL in c++?Lets say I want to check which side to go and then execute object-&gt;left, object-&gt;right and so on

 Rebollo: if side == LEFTobject-&gt;left
 MACKEYTH: Thx Wontonimo
 MACKEYTH: &amp; Astrobytes
 Rebollo: just do like object-&gt; + "left"
 jacek: chess programming wiki is quite resourceful
 Wontonimo: before doing alpha-beta, implement negamax.
 Astrobytes: Rebollo: int dx[LEFT] = -1
 jacek: MACKEYTH on the other hand, is your minimax bug-free? i think depth2 minimax with score eval should be enough
 jacek: to beat wood4
 Astrobytes: eg. int dx[4] = { 0, 1, 0, -1}
 Wontonimo: it's like minimax, except just max and every other move is *-1 value
 Astrobytes: int dy[4] = { -1, 0, 1, 0}
 MACKEYTH: Seems to be /relatively/ bug free. Doesn't time out or make illegal moves, at least
 Astrobytes: enum Direction&#160;: int { UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT }
 Astrobytes: Rebollo: does that help?
 Rebollo: for sure..I am just trying to full understand
 MACKEYTH: I found a really dumb bug last night where it was trying to evaluate moves without actually playing the stone it was simulating
 Wontonimo: do you have unit tests for the algo MACKEYTH?  for example my UTTT bot is 550 lines of code where as I also have 650 lines of unit test to make sure it does exactly the right thing 
 Rebollo: I know it is simple, but for e nothing is simple
 MACKEYTH: I'm not familiar with unit tests
 jacek: unit tests are for weaklings
 jacek: test on production on friday like CG
 Astrobytes: Rebollo: dx and dy arrays are the offsets to go up right down or left. The Direction enum starts from 0 ands at 3; use the enum to key into dx and dy, add these values to your current x,y position
 Astrobytes: *and ends
 Wontonimo: lol jacek&#160;!
 Wontonimo: i'll dm you some resources MACKEYTH
 MACKEYTH: Thanks!
 Rebollo: Would you mid give a full sample just one set of rows?

 Ceekay77: which language?
 Aaronnotsharon: c++
 Wontonimo: put it first into an array
 Wontonimo: then access the array
 Ceekay77: Im sure there is an stl way.  Im a C guy so id use strchr
 Wontonimo: which ascii art puzzle specifically?
 Ceekay77: strchr for '\n' eill get you the pointer to the next line
 Aaronnotsharon: it just says ASCII Art as the title. its in the easy catagory... I don't see an author for it or anything..

 Blokops: i dont get it
 Blokops: wow
 Blokops: .
 Blokops: .
 Blokops: dude you broke chat
 Astrobytes:         nah it stops
 Blokops: i gotta know how did you do it
 Astrobytes:        just copy my first post
 Astrobytes:       and use sparingly :P
 ninjadip: insane-o
 ninjadip: oh no!
 ninjadip: it's a virus
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: it does stop eventually
 ninjadip: it's got all of us....woe the web we weave
 ninjadip: oh it's done&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: there. Nice clean chat again :P
 ninjadip: oh those clean chat rooms are the worst
 Astrobytes: lol

 ASM_MOV_INT: lol
 ninjadip: nooo
 ASM_MOV_INT: what did I do?
 ASM_MOV_INT: copy paste that's it i swear
 ASM_MOV_INT: a
 ninjadip: way to go Sam, dropping them eaves
 ASM_MOV_INT: b
 ASM_MOV_INT: c
 ASM_MOV_INT: d
 Astrobytes: 
 Astrobytes: Oh cool, there's a spamming message now
 ASM_MOV_INT: there it's done
 Astrobytes: Now don't abuse this unicode trick, deploy with caution please.
 Astrobytes: works best when chat is busy so it's over and done with quick;ly
 Astrobytes: *quickly
 ASM_MOV_INT: what unicode # is that? and... why does it do that? rofl
 ninjadip: yeah, here's this ring that's super cool, but don't put it on or tell anyone about it
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Blokops: fun fact theres a worst version of it
 Blokops: much much worst
 Astrobytes: Don't :rofl:
 ASM_MOV_INT: i get into so much trouble looking at past posts of chat sometimes....
 ninjadip: is it really worst or worse
 Blokops: 1000% worst
 ninjadip: lol
 Blokops: like clip outside chat worst
 ninjadip: like going through space
 Josdel: hey guys
 Josdel: i'm cuck
 Josdel:&#160;:(
 Blokops: hi cuck im blokops how can i help you
 ninjadip: like what you said + "old"&#160;?
 Blokops:&#160;?
 ninjadip: cuckold
 ninjadip: or maybe he meant chuck
 Blokops: i think he meant stuck
 Astrobytes: yeah I'm gonna nip this convo in the bud now before it gets worse
 Astrobytes: keep it relatively clean people
 ninjadip: i think it's getting better by it's own accord, have some faith
 ninjadip: by its own momentum is probably better
 Astrobytes: I'm an ex-mod, I have 0 faith :D
 Blokops: didnt you post that unicode first
 Astrobytes: Yes :D
 ninjadip: when the river runs red just take the dirt road
 ninjadip: yeah i think he did, then turned us in for messing up
 Astrobytes: But getting into NSFW territory is a step too far
 Blokops: is the same principle as the panama river
 Astrobytes: lol not at all
 Astrobytes: @ninjadip
 Blokops: okey lets take it back to programing
 ninjadip: i can't really say that that cryptic message means here in  this clean room
 Blokops: php ama right guys?
 Astrobytes: at least unicode tricks are related&#160;;)
 ninjadip: more hacker than coder
 Astrobytes: troll-ish
 ninjadip: yes, unicode is
 Blokops: whats words but a unicode aranged
 Astrobytes: hehe
 Blokops: all this started bcasue of Automaton8000 fault
 Astrobytes: the other Automaton (NN not 2000) used to use that unicode thing I did now and then
 ninjadip: terrible power
 Astrobytes: it did that and pinged eulerscheZah l frequently
 Astrobytes: anyway, see ya all later
 Blokops: okey change of topic, yesterday did anyone if you post a link related to madpod racing
 Blokops: soemthing about how to follow a player
 Astrobytes: runners and blockers?
 Astrobytes: as in 1 pod is a runner (trying to get to next CP) and the other is blocking the opponent runner pod?
 Blokops: found it 
 Blokops: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732">https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732</a>
 Astrobytes: yeah, Scarfield posted it I think. That's a nice way to start with it, I got to high gold using steering behaviours, after that I took the sim + GA route
 Blokops: im using PID but is not enough 
 Astrobytes: I thiiink it's possible using PID too, what league+position are you in?
 Blokops: gold 1,245
 Blokops: use to be 400 but the rng is not kind today
 Astrobytes: nice, yeah it's kinda like that. If you're having no luck with your PID, try out some steering behaviours
 Astrobytes: You can get to legend without sim + search but most likely not too high
 Astrobytes: anyways, cya later, gotta run
 p.p.o.p.: I feel honored when they ask me to prove I'm not a bot before racing my pod...I shouldn't because I am very far down on the leader board lol
 ninjadip: lol
 ninjadip: who is asking you that
 ninjadip: what league are you in
 p.p.o.p.: CodinGame...bronze...i'm making negative progress
 ninjadip: wow no one talked to me ever in it
 ninjadip: and i got to gold and stopped playing
 p.p.o.p.: It's because i'm doing a super quick change without testing in the IDE and sending back to the arena
 ninjadip: need to implement seek and annoy for jet #2 and win with jet #1 lol
 p.p.o.p.: so the website thinks i'm a bot
 ninjadip: oh no, it just wants you to chill out
 ninjadip: i did that by accident on first
 ninjadip: need to test more with the bot in your IDE before submitting to the arena after every little change
 p.p.o.p.: Yeah they don't mean it in a good way at all. I'm just taking it as a compliment
 ninjadip: it just happens whenever you submit too much to the arena within a timeframe
 ninjadip: nothing to do with rank going up 
 p.p.o.p.: My IDE often doesn't actually show the bot running though so I make a change and then want to see its effect
 ninjadip: solving that involved enabling cookies for me
 p.p.o.p.: Oh. Thanks. I'll try that
 ninjadip: and once in a while that still happens, i refresh the page and it works again
 Astrobytes: there's also a constraint on number of IDE plays, it's a bit grim when you're adjusting parameters
 Astrobytes: +1 on refresh btw, the viewer crashes now and then and a refresh fixes it
 ninjadip: i can't for this mofo wave function to collapse
 ninjadip: so mad at it
 ninjadip: have to make some hot tea to chill out. sounds crazy
 p.p.o.p.: i thought you got it yesterday ninja
 ninjadip: i got test 1 and test 3 and test4 or something
 ninjadip: and i thought i was on it
 ninjadip: i talked to the creator today, Wontonimo, and was told that i was off track
 Blokops: what problem are you doing?
 ninjadip: but getting lucky lol
 ninjadip: so rewriting some of it now, i think i now how to finish it
 ninjadip: just time to write the code
 ninjadip: wave function collapse
 ninjadip: going to search more by pattern constraints than anything else
 Blabbage: ninjadip: ask if you need hints, I might be able to help
 Blabbage: I struggled for many hours...
 p.p.o.p.: Is the boss you play in the IDE the same as the one you play in the arena? I am beating it in my IDE but getting crushed by others in the arena
 Blokops: yes is the same
 Blokops: below next to the portrait of the boss there a delete button, click it and the choose the top 1 player
 Astrobytes: Yep, same boss. It's the players you really need to beat, 50%+ winrate against the boss plus high winrate against the rest of the league should do it
 p.p.o.p.: got it! Thanks
 Astrobytes: identify who you're losing against the most and watch replays to understand why, adjust bot to taste
 p.p.o.p.: "adjust bot to taste" :grinning:
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 p.p.o.p.: I like my bots speedy and curvy!
 Astrobytes: lol, sounds about right
 ninjadip: Blabbage thanks, just got back to console. i think i got it, just time to code
 ninjadip: well at least i got a direction now i mean
 ninjadip: just taking a break
 Wontonimo: hey ninjadip , WFC is marked as "hard".  really, it's hard.  I've been plugging away at it very part time for years.  
 ninjadip: don't discourage me
 ninjadip: i'm on a good track here
 Wontonimo: oh, no, ii meant it as encouragement!!!  you've made a way more progress than I made in the same time&#160;!!
 Blabbage: Nice, it's worth it though, so satisfying filling out the blanks&#160;;)
 ninjadip: doing like you said, i am changing my output/working grid from char to string, going to make it hold the possibilities
 ninjadip: i am so close
 ninjadip: so i got two classes that are working pretty good together
 ninjadip: with the patch class being able to do it's own testing of any other patch passed to it makes it very efficient code in the other loops 
 ninjadip: currently writing the constrain code
 ninjadip: i had to watch that youtube video again, makes even more sense after grasping the problem but failing. if that makes sense to anyone
 Blabbage: yes, same for me, it's easier to understand when you've already gotten dirty with the details
 ninjadip: yeah, that's what i always tell people when i'm training them at work, or used to train them
 ninjadip: watch me, try it, usually fail, now *really* watch me, and then  they watch better that second time lol
 ninjadip: oh, got to love some hot tea, all my problems are almost gone
 ninjadip: alcohol for the rest
 Astrobytes: what kind of tea though
 Blabbage: long island?
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 ninjadip: i've always been partial to earl grey, but sometimes i like the english or irish breakfast. but always black tea
 ninjadip: lol
 Astrobytes: earl grey and lady grey are both nice. Other than those I go for herbals
 ninjadip: one time i served a woman a long island iced tea, and spit out the first sip, and i had to explain that not only was it an alocholic drink, she had no idea, that it was almost all alcohol
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 ninjadip: she just thought long island ice tea sounded like a cooler regular tea
 ninjadip: lol
 Blabbage: it's soo elusive, it's strong but doesn't taste nearly as strong as it is
 Astrobytes: That's the beauty of a well made long island iced tea&#160;;)
 ninjadip: i think anyone will know that there's alcohol in it
 Astrobytes: *should know*
 ninjadip: both
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 ninjadip: man eff this Wontonimo
 ninjadip: i'm getting nowhere lol
 Blokops: helpi have 12 hours worth of reading to do in 24 hours
 Blokops: is more like 3 hours but with my adhd is 12
 ninjadip: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/421a5a0a-3747-4334-93ad-0788c75bca11">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/421a5a0a-3747-4334-93ad-0788c75bca11</a>
 p.p.o.p.: Okay. I'm a teacher. Now we're in my area of expertise! Do you need to be able to do things with the reading or talk about it Blokops?
 Blokops: there will be a quiz 
 ninjadip: always study for the quiz
 ninjadip: primarily
 p.p.o.p.: What subject?
 Blokops: but im really not best at thing that things you call "reading"
 Blokops: Software Arquitecture and Design
 ninjadip: i mean study for the quiz by focusing on the right sections. but discerning what is important...
 Blokops: Or S.A.D for short
 ninjadip: first thing first is know that there isn't a q in architecture 
 Blokops: im a engenirer not a writter
 ninjadip: i'm studying myself to be a software engineer 
 Blokops: cool beans, beware the filter classes
 Blokops: they are the worst
 ninjadip: i might be in the class you are in now
 p.p.o.p.: So the reading is on S.A.D.?
 Blokops: yes
 Blokops: need to read chap 1 and 2 also i need to watch 2 hours worth of videos and read again for other class
 Blokops: and make another assigment
 p.p.o.p.: Are there a lot of examples of software that follows the principles they talk about?
 Blokops: and make an essay 
 5922: Well, what are you doing on here? @_@
 Blokops: is 100% theory 
 Blokops: 0 coding
 ninjadip: ah no it's called operating platforms, but we are learning a lot of architecture
 ninjadip: i usually just skim the chapters
 ninjadip: is it on scrum and agile?
 Blokops: sigh well back to work i guess
 Blokops: you guys better not have fun while im out
 p.p.o.p.: If you are writing an essay on architecture I can guarantee you they don't care about writing quality...understand the software principles by looking at the example and make notes on what you find interesting, then write your essay on that...i guess we are not in my area of expertise though haha
 p.p.o.p.: Stabalizing around rank 8 on mad pod racing 
 ninjadip: did u do any drift counter steer yet
 ninjadip: that's when that thing flys
 ninjadip: flies
 Blokops: pasting a quote from the book seems relevant
 Blokops: "Good judgment is usually the result of experience. And experience is frequently the result of bad judgment. But to learn from the experience of others requires those who have the experience to share the knowledge with those who follow."
 p.p.o.p.: jeez that's terrible writing
 p.p.o.p.: well *that* won't be on the quiz and is not worth writing about
 p.p.o.p.: Oh I'm 5th and the boss is 4th!
 p.p.o.p.: So close!
 Astrobytes: yes, adjust so you drift nicely into the checkpoint and life will be smoother
 p.p.o.p.: just dropped WAY down
 Astrobytes: what league you in?
 p.p.o.p.: Bronze, nothing to brag about
 Astrobytes: ok, best advice for bronze -&gt; gold is keep it simple
 ASM_MOV_INT: so good judgment is frequently the result of bad judgment
 ASM_MOV_INT: learning from results of previous bad judgment
 ASM_MOV_INT: :innocent:
 Slyyyy: hello whats a good way to pick up on javascript
 ASM_MOV_INT: I started clashing with it, and seem to have picked it up relatively quickly
 Blokops: start with the simple stuff
 ASM_MOV_INT: it's all i clash in now...
 ASM_MOV_INT: w3schools also helps
 Slyyyy: ive been trying the clashs but get stuck sometimes
 Blokops: the first step at being sort of good is being sort of bad
 ASM_MOV_INT: that's normal
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 ASM_MOV_INT: if I can't get it, I hope that others share their code.... sometimes the problems get stuck in my head, and wish I could see the original code solution
 ASM_MOV_INT: :sunglasses: problems of a clash addict
 ASM_MOV_INT: sometimes I think I want to learn python.... then I see some of the solutions in python, and think.... um, i'm good
 ASM_MOV_INT: it's more syntax rules than I care to devote to memory
 ASM_MOV_INT: if and when I need to learn it... I will
 Blokops: it took me ages to learn about map and lambda
 Astrobytes: you can always keep working on the problem ASM_MOV_INT
 Astrobytes: look it up at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Astrobytes: just try to remember something about the clash so you can find it again
 ASM_MOV_INT: @astrobytes what is that? oh!  that's .... awesomeness
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm going to have to try that
 ASM_MOV_INT: ty
 ninjadip: and i'm going to burn this wave function program to the ground
 ASM_MOV_INT: wave function collapse is still wandering around my brain... waiting for me to turn it into some form of code soon
 Astrobytes: ASM_MOV_INT: yeah it's a useful tool that
 ASM_MOV_INT: especially for reverse lookups that no one solves! rofl
 Astrobytes: also handy if you come across problematic ones that need reporting or downvoting, generally useful. Give props to euler whenever you see him
 ASM_MOV_INT: oh sweet, it pulls the puzzle back into the IDE!!!! ty
 ASM_MOV_INT: they should just link to the contribute view for every puzzle
 Astrobytes: when you get to a certain level (And/or number of clashes for clashes) it does
 ASM_MOV_INT: ah
 Astrobytes: Useful if there is a problematic clash or puzzle. Abused by some but for the most part I think it's respected.

 frez017: does anyone think that there is a problem with the game when clashing&#160;? im sometimes 100% sure that my code is clean of errors and still the engine cant read my solution
 Blokops: no
 Blokops: do you get below 100%?
 Blokops: sometimes is becasue you dont test all test cases
 frez017: it doesnt read the code when i test
 Blokops: do you have a sample of said code?
 Wontonimo: hey hey
 Blokops: hey hey hey
 Wontonimo: did you solve WFC ASM_MOV_INT&#160;?
 Blokops: me?
 Wontonimo: no, ASM_MOV_INT 
 ASM_MOV_INT: no
 Wontonimo: I'm starting to think it should be classified as 'very hard'&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: 54% success rate so far, and that includes the contributors 
 ASM_MOV_INT: I just haven't tried it, I want to do it as a personal project, so loading it into my brain makes me want to go offline and try it in my personal programming...
 Dorak: Just out of curiosity, is there a shortcut to the "Play All Test Cases" button?
 Wontonimo: click the button&#160;?
 DaNinja: ctrl+shift+enter
 Dorak: Thank you very much, Ninja.
 ASM_MOV_INT: he meant to ask 'keyboard shortcut'
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 Wontonimo: i'm allowed to be a troll and a mod at the same time right?
 Wontonimo: in all seriousness, i didn't know there was a shortcut.  leave it to our resident ninja to know how to execute things quickly
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 DaNinja:&#160;;)
 DaNinja: Havent found a shortcut for Replay in Same Conditions yet
 Wontonimo: *execution* is more your style anyway
 struct: hi Wontonimo
 struct: hi *everyone
 Wontonimo: hey struct
 struct: Wontonimo im going to attempt to learn NN's once again
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 struct: What should my first step be before trying?
 Wontonimo: jacek's tutorial&#160;!
 struct: anything you think its important?
 struct: like math or something like that
 Blokops: one sec i have some prof presentations that could help you

 struct: dont think so
 struct: thanks Blokops Ill check it
 Wontonimo: i think those will be a bit much blokops for a 1st intro
 Blokops: do the first link first
 struct: i also have the "nnfs" book that I bought a while back
 Blokops: the first link has a good explanation
 Wontonimo: are you familiar with GA struct?
 struct: never tried it 
 struct: not going well :p
 Blokops: maybe try to start from the begening
 Wontonimo: okay, take a look at this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUPFOFbCeFI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUPFOFbCeFI</a> 
 Blokops: try k nearest nenigbord and move from there
 Wontonimo: I like to first dispel some concepts around machine learning
 Wontonimo: and i try to do so in that video.
 Wontonimo: hopefully after seeing the code in action 
 Wontonimo: you'll see that starting with a plausable function but with the wrong parameters you can find the parameters through trial and error
 struct: will watch
 struct: watching rn*
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: (and embarrassing)
 Blokops: going to have to give up on mad pod racing for now
 Blokops: rank 1,500 is good enouhg right?
 Wontonimo: for what?
 Wontonimo: good enough to show you are solid into gold?  yeah!
 Blokops: been going hard on this page because i have a interview in feb 
 Blokops: but im been stuck in the mad pod racing far to long
 Blokops: need to learn other stuff
 Wontonimo: i was "stuck" in it for about 3 months
 Blokops: going to wait fro summer break after that will defeat you :point_right:
 Wontonimo: struct, what do you think of the video?
 struct: There are plenty of games to try
 struct: good so far im only 8min in
 Wontonimo: ah
 struct: had to afk for a bit
 Blokops: well now that im moving away from MPR
 Blokops: any suggestions on what to do next
 Blokops: something to teach me how to code better
 Wontonimo: like what kind of algo do you want to try?
 Wontonimo: do you want to learn minimax or MCTS&#160;?
 Blokops: whatever will help in a techncial interview
 struct: ok so no AI
 struct: I would do puzzles I think
 struct: and even then there might be better places for this
 Blokops: clash of code been a big help at lerning python better
 Blokops: i can now free style rap python
 Wontonimo: clash is probably the best for coding interview
 struct: are interviews clash level?
 Blokops: the first round will be 90 minutes to do 2 problems
 Wontonimo: maybe try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Blokops: been doing those all month
 struct: Blokops I would look for binarysearch site
 struct: Lots of interview type questions there
 Blokops: thanks again for the help with the water problem
 Wontonimo: blub blub
 Wontonimo: yeah, my pleasure :D
 Wontonimo: do you practice coding without a proper editor and without google&#160;?
 Blokops: mostly here
 Blokops: google i do use but mostly math stuff
 Wontonimo: something that will make you stand out and look pro level is to be able to code without autocomplete, without googling stuff, and compiling once (maybe twice)
 Wontonimo: so specifically practice that on easy coding problems like fizzbuzz
 Wontonimo: count the number of compiles you need to solve the problem and work on reducing it to one or two
 Blokops: reverse fizzbuzz?
 Wontonimo: nobody does that kind of practice, and the only people who have those kind of skills are people who have coded every day professionally for decades.  so you'll appear way more experienced than you are
 Wontonimo: fizzbuzz is this problem <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/">https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/</a>
 Wontonimo: but i don't mean fizzbuzz specifically.  i mean problems like it.  fairly simple interview questions
 Blokops: seems easy enough, i bet i can solve it in one line
 struct: sometimes problems can be tricky though
 struct: they seem to have a simple solution but you need to take into account the complexity
 Blokops: true true 
 Blokops: this seems more like a math problem
 Blokops: doneprint([ [[i,"Fizz"][i%3==0],["Buzz","FizzBuzz"][i%3==0]][i%5==0] for i in range(1,n)])
 Blokops: shortest mode has thought me well
 struct: yeah
 struct: just dont do that in the interview
 struct: :p
 Blokops: also the complexity is absolutely shit

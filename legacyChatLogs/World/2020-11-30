 miszu: struct as X
 miszu: I implemented teccle, I win and draw more often
 miszu: but once teccle is over, I do like 19k
 struct: oh
 struct: how long do you run teccle s heuristic for
 miszu: against gold boss, the 1st moves
 miszu: basically, if it is an empty miniboard, do tickle
 struct: your current arena bot
 struct: is it the new one?
 miszu: no, it's the old
 struct: so you get around 20k on turn 5?
 miszu: turn 9
 miszu: so at the 18th frame
 struct: on 18th frame I have around 32k
 struct: but maybe 20k should be able to pass gold
 miszu: I have an idea to improve my score
 struct: you can try and submit to see where you place currently
 miszu: I'll try in a bit

 rockstar555: if any problem in this
 rockstar555: plz tell
 rockstar555: this is my first time to make contribution
 PatrickMcGinnisII: adding 2 numbers? for real?
 miszu: Google: can you start working tomorrow morning?
 struct: Only missing 3d viewer
 miszu: I don't get it. I don't use vectors and barely make more sims
 struct: whats the difference?
 miszu: 4k
 miszu: I don't get how top people can do 150k sims
 PatrickMcGinnisII: considering I can only do 2k full sims, pfft
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 150k nodes or sims?
 miszu: sims
 miszu: top players apparently
 miszu: are those pragmas sufficient?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can set compiler options, but i don't know them
 miszu: #pragma GCC optimize("O3","unroll-loops", "inline")
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think there is an error_handling one too
 miszu: what would it do?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: exception handler... i think it can be turned off
 miszu: yeah but why would it increase sims?
 Westicles: this is common
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/collisions-in-fantastic-bits/2369/3">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/collisions-in-fantastic-bits/2369/3</a>
 miszu: also I use rand()
 miszu: is that slow?
 struct: there are faster alternatives
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 
 miszu: also I do a lot of modulus for my pool indexes
 miszu: let me find that one
 ZarthaxX: change those modulus
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Y22OlWL.gif">https://i.imgur.com/Y22OlWL.gif</a>
 struct: I need to make the pieces
 struct: I dont want to use blender again&#160;:'(
 ZarthaxX: OMGGGG
 ZarthaxX: so nice
 ZarthaxX: lol blender F
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that for the pharoahs thing?
 struct: yes patric
 struct: patrick*
 miszu: ZarthaxX how can I loop around the pools without modulus?
 tomatoes: idx&#160;% pool_size?
 struct: yes tomatoes
 miszu: yeah but it uses modulus
 struct: Remove it
 struct: and start from 0 again
 struct: when you start your search
 struct: dont  reuse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: miszu you'll find that simple tricks on code that is executed alot makes a big difference
 tomatoes: you can use pool_size = 2^n-1
 miszu: struct, so at the beginning of main loop, I set next node to 0?
 struct: or 1 since the root will be 0
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, struct i submitted a random Yinsh...smh
 struct: nice
 miszu: so struct you don't reuse your mcts in next moves?
 miszu: like you always recompute?
 tomatoes: and even with tree reuse i get at most 3m nodes at the end of game
 struct: yes i dont reuse
 miszu: I see
 tomatoes: so modulo really not needed
 miszu: tomates, you 2^n  - 1, how you loop around then?
 tomatoes: i had it some other :thinking: othello prbably
 miszu: in uttt I use more than 3m at the end of a sim
 miszu: of the game*
 tomatoes: a lot more? or a bit?
 miszu: let me check
 tomatoes: you can just reset root each turn and overwrite existed
 miszu: 4 millions
 miszu: 4 041 164
 tomatoes: make 5-6m nodes and plain indexing
 miszu: plain as no modulus?
 tomatoes: yep
 miszu: what about rand() vs others? Big difference struct?
 struct: There is quite a difference yes
 struct: But always profile it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: c uses a pseudo random number generator anyway
 miszu: how you profile efficiently?
 miszu: just use clock around it?
 struct: I run it localy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's fast, but for small set of numbers, there are faster
 struct: its not perfect but better than nothing
 struct: In cg there are multiple machines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: an old post says something about 1ghz to 2ghz processors could be used radomly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: radomly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: randomly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: its prolly changed since then, but it does vary
 miszu: ok ill get rid of modulus then see the benchmarks
 tomatoes: profile with vtune, valgrind, perf or whatever
 struct: are you on ubuntu or windows miszu?

 miszu: got rid of modulus
 miszu: meh
 miszu: maybe 1k

 rockstar555: please approve me
 rockstar555: this is my first time
 AntiSquid: don't beg for approvals . if it's good people will approve
 rockstar555: okk
 rockstar555: or 
 rockstar555: Sorry
 AntiSquid: and that should be rejected lol
 AntiSquid: sum of 2 numbers, really? please . you are capable of better than that
 rockstar555: if u are moderator 
 rockstar555: than i show u
 rockstar555: how to work hard
 AntiSquid: you could put your words in one message and stop splitting them
 Uljahn: could've been haiku :smiley:
 AntiSquid: you mean he's been talking in haikus all the time?
 AntiSquid: maybe i should just do some rewly hurd wark and make a clash puzzle too 
 AlanMarx: Does anyone know how to find out what the next output would have been when your program times out of one of the challenges? I'm trying to figure out where things are going wrong with my code DX
 AntiSquid: you can't, when it times out you're out and it's not because of future outputs, try to output current input also use try catch 
 AntiSquid: read default code for debug output
 AntiSquid: what language are you using?
 AlanMarx: Python. Trying Ghost in the Cell, if that helps
 Q12: To me, when I receive the message I just make the algorithm faster and it solve it.
 AlanMarx: And thank you&#160;:) 
 AntiSquid: # Write an action using print
 Westicles: Q12, that's what I do with contributions.  When my pi puzzle gets rejected I'm going for 2 million digits
 Q12: Yeah, in this way you make the difficulty of the contribution higher.
 Q12: But I see that it is not rejected yet
 Westicles: Only a matter of time
 Q12: I think, according to the discussion there, that maybe you can give a hint to how to calculate it.
 Westicles: Hard to say.  The guy who said that has a grudge against me, rejects everything I do
 Q12: ahhh
 AntiSquid: tell him to get 2 alts
 AntiSquid: and why the grudge&#160;?
 Q12: so I don't know, at least your contribution has 7 upvotes, it says something about it :slight_smile:
 Westicles: Not sure.  Sometimes people don't like each other for no good reason
 AntiSquid: well i see a greta fan, but won't downvote just because of that :P
 rockstar555: represent a new contribution in few minutes
 rockstar555: clash of code
 tomatoes: substract?
 Uljahn: :joy:
 Westicles: Not sure what a greta is, unless it is the funny looking little girl on google
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/56591a3a2a8607e928bb302ca8979f2fd104">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/56591a3a2a8607e928bb302ca8979f2fd104</a>
 AntiSquid: greta avatar
 AntiSquid: but didn't even downvote :P
 AntiSquid: rockstar555 get a greta avatar too, it helps the trolling 
 Westicles: Hah, now two rejects from dbag Stilgart
 sahilrox: If an accepted clash of code question is wrong, is there any way to revert it?
 Stilgart: If you are unhappy with this, learn how to make fun/interesting problems
 Westicles: Learn how not to be a dbag
 sahilrox: I played a clash where the test cases were wrong, can something be done about it?
 Stilgart: sahilrox: there is, but so many clashes are broken and I have lost faith
 sahilrox:&#160;:(
 sahilrox: Okay, just to confirm, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57213f4203fc00dc7d2a189c910470d72ece">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/57213f4203fc00dc7d2a189c910470d72ece</a>Here test case 4 violates the statement right?
 sahilrox: In terms of decimal precision
 AntiSquid: you can edit clashes after playing 50 i think
 Stilgart: as do test 4, validator 3, and so on...
 sahilrox: Hmm okay thanks
 Westicles: Have you made any puzzles Stilgart?  I just see you whining on the forum all the time
 AntiSquid: Westicles if you call him a dbag for rejecting it's just antagonizing him, maybe you said something similar to the other guy? not best way to get votes, i mean just compare to rockstar555 who "politely" begged for upvotes
 Westicles: Nah, I didn't say anything to the other guy.  But I think it is fair game to antagonize after the fact.  I mean really, his feedback is just really low effort
 Westicles: Plus his complaining about the JPS puzzle
 Stilgart: Westicles: even if this is not visible, I have edited/fixed/rewritten many puzzles 
 Stilgart: as for JPS, it was completely broken and I fixed it
 Stilgart: when you don't know what you're speaking avout, shut your mouth./h
 Westicles: I think I know just fine, thank you
 Uljahn: Looks like quality vs quantity to me. Should we accept the level of contributions dropping as we get lot more of them? Or should we be more picky? I guess it's for community collective effort to determine the balance, so we need extreme opinions to coexist.
 Stilgart: I think the community already made its choice
 Stilgart: almost nobody solves the puzzles
 Westicles: Also, some are a little hidebound in their thinking.  If it isn't a sorting puzzle, it isn't a puzzle
 Stilgart: say that to euler
 AntiSquid: they pop up like mushrooms after the rain, not much time ...
 Westicles: I think others specifically reject problems because they are not up to solving them in the language they use
 Stilgart: see my message above then&#160;:)
 Westicles: You think you can get a million digits in Haskell?
 Westicles: It would be a challenge, I admit
 AntiSquid: hey totally agree with you on the puzzles, they shouldn't be centered around sorting stuff Westicles, but isn't your code interpreting puzzle a bit too weird?
 Westicles: It really is no different than golf solutions
 Stilgart: tech.io is the place for this kind of stuff... but nobody seems to know that
 Westicles: hidebound
 Westicles: or as the kids say, gatekeeper
 Westicles: Anyhow, no big deal.  I didn't expect them to be approved, but it sure is fun poking fun at the stolid rejectors
 Q12: I think that we should be more "picky" as Uljahn said with types of puzzles that a lot of people contribute and less "picky" with the other types.For example: we have a lot of easy puzzles but not the same amount of puzzles with difficulty hard.Because of this we can allow ourselves to be more "picky" with common types of contributions but less "picky" with rare types of contributions.

 NguyenVinhHien: whats wrong with the server
 rockstar555: yeah
 rockstar555: saying right
 rockstar555: is anyone here
 rockstar555: hii
 MSmits: yo
 rockstar555: hey view my new contribution
 MSmits: you made a mother contribution you said?
 rockstar555: sorry
 rockstar555: another
 MSmits: aha
 jacek: huh
 rockstar555: hii
 MSmits: dont have time to look at it right now, i am in class, doing surveillance
 rockstar555: i think now server working right
 MSmits: sup jacek
 MSmits: what are you working on these days
 jacek: not much with ai
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: but what on CG?
 MSmits: you're just hanging?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: ahh ok, good, better than nothing
 rockstar555: cam u explain how to make a contest
 rockstar555: sorry
 MSmits: you use the SDK to make a game
 rockstar555: cam
 MSmits: cam?
 rockstar555: can
 MSmits: oh 
 rockstar555: ohh
 MSmits: well you make a game and ask a dev if it is any good\
 MSmits: but this is really a long term thing
 rockstar555: okk
 MSmits: generally, you make multi arenas
 MSmits: if you like
 MSmits: thats similar to a contest
 rockstar555: yeah i like multiplayer game
 MSmits: right, well you can try make one of those
 MSmits: but it has to be good if you want to get enough players to play it
 MSmits: there's much to choose from already
 rockstar555: hey can u view my contribution and tell it is right
 rockstar555: or either wrong
 MSmits: dont have time to look seriously at a contribution atm
 rockstar555: okk
 MSmits: usually after a contest its hard to get people to look at them, because everyone is tired
 MSmits: right after contest, CG goes really quiet
 MSmits: well a day or two after
 MSmits: gets better later
 rockstar555: okk
 rockstar555: now i have to solve bot programming
 rockstar555: to became silver to gold in CSB
 MSmits: sure, you can do that
 MSmits: I prefer board games myself
 rockstar555: ohh
 rockstar555: nice
 Stilgart: rockstar555: do you know that some languages provide a gcd function, which makes your contribution rahter unfair&#160;?&#160;:(
 Stilgart: (and that some don't)
 MSmits: gcd?
 MSmits: global common denominator?
 Stilgart: greatest common divisor
 rockstar555: yeah
 rockstar555: greatest common divisor
 Stilgart: which is the main topic of rockstar555's contribution
 rockstar555: yeah
 rockstar555: but  i write in python
 MSmits: is it a clash or puzzle?
 rockstar555: clash
 MSmits: ah yeah then its unfair
 Stilgart: I suggest that you add some story around your contribution, or it might be viewed as a duplicate
 rockstar555: why
 Stilgart: (a gcd clash ought to exist already)
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - will you start RAIC this year? Or have bit such plan because it is no inf. about prizes? Or you do not like the game? For now it is only beta and only around 150 peoples - I see only few nicknames from CG
 rockstar555: it is made u
 rockstar555: so i can change it in shortest
 Stilgart: JFB: raic asks for too much investement imho
 MSmits: so it's basically iterate over all denominators and check if x&#160;% d == 0?
 Stilgart: this year's game seems awesome
 Stilgart: MSmits: it's basically gcd(a,b)
 MSmits: if the language has that
 Stilgart: except in C/JAVA
 Stilgart: it is the greatest integer that divide both a and b, otherwise
 ..O_O..: yeah he can add some story or find gcd and do something instead of finding gcd and no information about gcd in statement
 MSmits: allright onto my next class, this one was boring. Next one needs my attention. Ttyl&#160;:)
 JFB: Stilgart - it is really a lot of investment. But it will be Christmas and New Year holidays ...&#160;;-) 
 jacek: i thought you were teaching this class?
 JFB: MSmits - this new class will be more interesting because it will be more practical? For example: how to build small atomic bomb in your kitchen&#160;;-) 
 wlesavo: JFB euler said he will join, for now  you can check #raic2020
 JFB: Thank you wlesavo&#160;:-)
 YodaMaster123: Hey all new coder here, starting with the tutorial AI Challenge and I found some mentions about a "magic formula". Can someone tell me what it is?
 Uljahn: it alterates your target position depending on your velocity vector, so your pod can somehow compensate it's velocity and drift
 YodaMaster123: so something like target - the velocity?
 YodaMaster123: or target - coefficient * velocity.
 Uljahn: target - 3*Velocity, yes
 YodaMaster123: Thanks!
 YodaMaster123: Is there a derivation for this formula somewhere?
 MSmits: no, but it works
 YodaMaster123:&#160;:)
 MSmits: also, it ends the CSB fun a bit prematurely, because after that, you can only improve with an actual search algorithm
 Blended: Is there a programing language similar to rasbin? Or arduino?
 MSmits: and that's a huge stepup
 MSmits: blended, try C#
 Blended: okay
 MSmits: Arduino is C or C++ I think, but C# is way more beginner friendly
 Blended: Oh sick! It looks almost like it!
 MSmits: yeah
 YodaMaster123: Yeah, I just gave a cursory glance to those docs given...Its so much more than the 50 line thing that I just did.
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: thats the simulation mostly
 MSmits: not even the search
 MSmits: simulation just calculates what happens to the game when you do certain actions
 MSmits: search tries to find out what the actual best action is
 YodaMaster123: Isn't the search part easy? generate a random set of moves and score the end situation?
 MSmits: sure, you can do that, but it will be very bad
 MSmits: thats called monte carlo search
 ZarthaxX: that's a montecarlo approach
 ZarthaxX: smito i ahte u
 ZarthaxX: you won this time&#160;:(
 MSmits: sry
 ZarthaxX: hai 
 YodaMaster123: But in 75s can't you search enough to get a good answer?
 MSmits: hi 
 ZarthaxX: how are your turtles
 YodaMaster123: *75ms
 MSmits: doing good, taking good care of them
 ZarthaxX: complexity explodes YodaMaster123
 ZarthaxX: i mean, the tree size
 ZarthaxX: anyway u kind of get a good answer i guess, you gotta define good
 ZarthaxX: MSmits i meant the pawn ones
 ZarthaxX: :P
 MSmits: if you want to search 7 turns into the future like I do, you have 4 pods doing around 5 different kinds of moves every turn 
 ZarthaxX: btw i beated them after wselav o said he beated them
 ZarthaxX: thought it was impossible lol
 YodaMaster123: Ok, so then do modifications on the previous move set to get it more focussed?
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/512232624">https://www.codingame.com/replay/512232624</a> my Bot likes to do a double win
 MSmits: so 4 ^ (5*7)
 MSmits: = 4^35
 ZarthaxX: that's wrong
 MSmits: is it?
 MSmits: 5*5*5*5 for one turn]
 ZarthaxX: why did you put 4 pods as base?
 MSmits: oh ok
 ZarthaxX: 5^4
 MSmits: 5^(4*7)
 MSmits: you're right
 ZarthaxX: right
 MSmits: so 5^28 = worse
 YodaMaster123: Understood, impossible to search any statistically relevant amount of this.
 ZarthaxX: i mean you can, but have to be smart when doing so
 MSmits: YodaMaster123 there's several ways to do it
 ZarthaxX: montecarlo works as a base
 ZarthaxX: euler guy, who is 1st in CG, always tries montecarlo first on games
 ZarthaxX: it's an okeish way to start, and fast
 MSmits: on some games it's great
 ZarthaxX: also true
 MSmits: works fine on locam
 YodaMaster123: After that you can move ahead to more advanced solutions?
 ZarthaxX: right
 MSmits: yes, but the annoying part is, you never get a working bot in csb with monte carlo
 YodaMaster123: And it serves as a good base right? You can use the same simulation and evaluation function?
 MSmits: they will just go around doing nothing useful, not even knowing how to get to the next checkpoint
 ZarthaxX: right
 MSmits: tbh if you want to learn how to do a real search, CSB is a bad place to start
 MSmits: it's pretty hard to do
 YodaMaster123: Where do I start then?
 MSmits: simple games that dont require much simulation
 MSmits: like a board game
 miszu: honestly, you won't go far without simulations
 miszu: don't be afraid to make simulations
 miszu: it's the fun part
 MSmits: not for me really
 YodaMaster123: But in a board game you have to predict the opponent? So how does the search work then?
 MSmits: thats the interesting part YodaMaster123
 MSmits: try learn minimax, or monte carlo tree* search
 MSmits: this is not monte carlo btw, its different
 MSmits: but minimax is easiest
 ZarthaxX: true
 ZarthaxX: 2 liner
 ZarthaxX: :P
 miszu: but you need to represent your game state and be able to make actions on it
 MSmits: monte carlo tree search is much more coding and hard to debug
 YodaMaster123: Will start working on minimax&#160;:) I can ask doubts here right?
 MSmits: so better start with minimax
 MSmits: yeah
 miszu: yeah
 MSmits: minimax has much example code on google
 MSmits: even the wiki 's are god
 MSmits: good
 ZarthaxX: smito do you think mcts is overall better?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 miszu: if you ask the right question, people are willing to help
 MSmits: depends on the calc time
 ZarthaxX: ah.. okey
 MSmits: and the quality of eval
 ZarthaxX: and the game?
 MSmits: yeah thats the eval part
 ZarthaxX: ah
 MSmits: some games are easy to eval
 ZarthaxX: there is one simple game, i wonder what approach would be better
 MSmits: yavalath is notoriously hard to mcts, but easy to do a minimax
 ZarthaxX: tho i could try both
 YodaMaster123: So Othello would be the easiest to start with right? Simple rules and simulation?
 ZarthaxX: yeah i remember yavalath with mcts, the traps states
 MSmits: uttt is easier, but othello is fine
 YodaMaster123: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe?
 MSmits: othello has some nice example code on google also
 MSmits: yes YodaMaster123
 MSmits: it has a nice lower league with just s 3x3 board
 ZarthaxX: check this smito
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1875/isolation">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1875/isolation</a>
 YodaMaster123: Ok, but after that does it go into that 3x3x3 setup?
 ZarthaxX: pretty simple game, but i feel as there is a trap thing related to the area you have
 ZarthaxX: like someone cutting the path to a big area for you and your eval going down hill :P
 MSmits: 3x3 x 9
 YodaMaster123: Oh.
 MSmits: looking now ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: aight
 YodaMaster123: But wouldn't Ultimate Tic Tac Toe be hard to evaluate? 
 MSmits: looks interesting
 ZarthaxX: also it's cool to teach bot programming
 MSmits: YodaMaster123 yes, but  you can write a simple eval at first
 ZarthaxX: super simple
 miszu: YodaMaster123 yes thus why you have to go with mcts
 MSmits: you dont have to get nr 1 at first YodaMaster123
 ZarthaxX: you can teach bfs for an eval there too
 MSmits: its just for learning purposes, make a simple evakl
 MSmits: learn mcts after
 MSmits: there's a few minimax bots in legend, so its doable
 YodaMaster123: Why doesn't miniaxx work as well?
 Astrobytes: harder to write a meaningful eval
 Astrobytes: also, hi all
 ZarthaxX: HI ASTRO
 jrke: hey bytes
 Astrobytes: jrkethaxX
 MSmits: YodaMaster123 minimax depends on an eval function
 MSmits: mcts depends on random playouts from leafs of the tree
 YodaMaster123: But Monte Carlo Tree Search is exhaustive. 
 MSmits: what do you mean
 YodaMaster123: It keeps moving till the game ends?
 YodaMaster123: So you don't need to evaluate it right?
 ZarthaxX: merging people now astro
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: it expands the branches with better winrates basically YodaMaster123
 MSmits: the winrates come from random playouts yes
 YodaMaster123: Ok, so you don't need to have that slow evaluation function there. You can search more.
 MSmits: because this game is hard to evaluate, mcts has an edge, but its not a huge edge, you can still do reasonably well
 MSmits: the eval function is not slow ctually
 MSmits: the random playouts are much slower i think
 MSmits: but you search the tree more efficiently
 MSmits: best first as opposed to breadth first search
 MSmits: you dont waste time exploring bad branches]
 jrke: which game you are talking about MS
 jrke:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yeah ZarthaxX :D
 YodaMaster123: So you can search it for the most likely to win methods rather than obviously wrong things like Minimax.
 MSmits: minimax also have some methods for this
 MSmits: like ab pruning and such
 MSmits: but for this particular game mcts beats it
 Q12: I practiced minmax algorithm with the game checkers, I think it is a good game to practice it.
 wlesavo: jrke take a wild guess :smiley:
 MSmits: yes, but checkers is hard to simulate
 MSmits: because of the jumps
 jrke: :smiley:
 Q12: yeah
 Q12: This was the hard part
 jrke: Q12 i think oware awaba is good for starting minimax
 MSmits: jrke you asked about dots and boxes
 Q12: I don't know this game jrke
 Q12: I will try it

 MSmits: I promise it will be up there, but i have a huge pile of work 
 MSmits: will be a while still
 YodaMaster123: pruning will still require you to search part of the tree. Does that happen in Monte Carlo?
 jrke: i am not asking i am waiting for your BOT MSmits
 MSmits: i know
 MSmits: i am waiting to have more time, i really want it up there, its just very hard and time consuming to get my offline solver in a working bot
 MSmits: its a 1500 line thing
 MSmits: and it lacks many parts of the bot 
 MSmits: it just solves endgames halfway through the game
 jrke: yup btw Dots and boxes is having maximum no. of players in arena in any community game
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: good cp then
 jrke: yup 2991cps
 MSmits: YodaMaster123 mcts searches the branches that are good, which is a kind of pruning
 MSmits: it stops exploring bad branches after some number of visits
 YodaMaster123: Understood.
 jrke: MCTS is prefered for big branching factor tree as far as i know
 MSmits: mmh depends
 MSmits: Yavalath has huge branching also
 miszu: alright, time to submit my bot in UTTT. Cross fingers for legendary
 Astrobytes: good luck miszu!
 MSmits: but minimax does better, unless you make you mcts really sophisticated
 MSmits: good luck&#160;:)
 jrke: gl miszu
 jrke: now my next targeted multi is tron battle
 MSmits: the thing with mcts in yavalath is that there are many losing moves and you need to filter them out in the random rollout
 MSmits: I never got good at tron
 jrke: done with fall-challenge now
 MSmits: the 4p thing is too annoying
 jrke: MaxN is thing i want to learn for tron
 jrke: but currently going to write sim to get atleast gold
 MSmits: not sure if people use maxN
 MSmits: some do paranoid I think
 MSmits: and some fancy graph stuff combined with floodfill
 jrke: maybe not sure about that
 MSmits: there's some problem with small passages
 MSmits: you can only go through them once, so floodfill gives a bad result the
 MSmits: then
 Astrobytes: Voronoi-based heuristics too iirc
 MSmits: yes the floodfill
 MSmits: but it gives a bad result when you cant go in every direction at once
 jrke: i understood what is vornoi very easily but never get the idea to code it :smiley:
 MSmits: imagine doing a sequential floodfill
 MSmits: p1 flood, p2 flood, p3 flood etc
 MSmits: 1 square each
 struct: Hello
 Astrobytes: hi struct
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: and keep doing until the board is full\
 jrke: nice MS
 BrunoFelthes: hi MSmits, what kind of algo are you using at Onitama?
 MSmits: mcts without rollout
 BrunoFelthes: hum
 MSmits: I eval all children at leaf
 MSmits: and backpropagate eval
 miszu: oaky so now my bot is doing better than previous submission
 BrunoFelthes: nice
 MSmits: train arriving, have to be off for about 20 mins, ttyl
 BrunoFelthes: I'm using Minimax, but i think that it is not very good... my deep at the start of the game is 4...
 miszu: 30th and 56% done
 struct: how many rollouts atm miszu?
 miszu: after teccle done, like 20-25k
 miszu: but MSmits gave me a nice clue about my exploration variable I could tweak and it wins more locally
 miszu: so my problem is my mcts don't see trap moves that could be losing
 wlesavo: miszu you dont reuse your tree yet, do you?
 miszu: no I don't as for now
 wlesavo: i see, 20-25k should be enough for legend i think
 miszu: reusing is not complicated to add
 wlesavo: i think you only need to track root node
 miszu: yeah and add a function gived a move, how to move down a root
 miszu: and if that path has not been explored, then fresh mcts
 wlesavo: i think that situation wont ever happen
 miszu: which situation?
 struct: also you can explore even when you do heuristic
 struct: having a path that has not been explored at all
 miszu: boys, 10th now with 45% done
 miszu: 5th!
 miszu: 4th!
 miszu: 2n!
 miszu: 1st! Now it's just me vs the boss
 jesuisdev.net: hi guys. May I solicitate your help, is anyone have any suggestion where  to deply asp.net Core 3.1. app with angular for a price - let say reasonabley cheap&#160;??? thanks for your attention. L
 Uljahn: miszu: have you tried to change exploration coefficient?
 miszu: Uljahn yeah I have done that now and the current run is doing much better
 miszu: I switched from sqrt 2 to 0.5
 Uljahn: i see you're above the boss, good job
 miszu: thanks!&#160;:)
 miszu: YAY! Promotion to Legend!
 Astrobytes: hey congrats!&#160;::)
 miszu: thanks&#160;:)
 miszu: can't believe the exploration factor was the key
 struct: grats
 miszu: hopefully I won't be the last in legends haha
 darkhorse64: You can't. There are two broken bots at the bottom
 wlesavo: miszu gratz :slight_smile: i knew you had enough rollouts
 miszu: darkhorse64 ok so not last among functionable bots :D
 miszu: to be honest, I was a bit disapointed by my # of rollouts
 miszu: I avoided vectors and just got 5k more sims
 darkhorse64: Hey, it's just the start. It took me weeks to reach 90k
 miszu: darkhorse64 how you find the bottleneck?
 tomatoes: use profiler
 darkhorse64: profiling; trial and error; papers reading
 miszu: yeah profiler but it just shows CPU usage
 tomatoes: should show what exactly code is using cpu
 miszu: the build in profiler in visual studio is enough?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 darkhorse64: Pro tip: do not spend too much time on this multi; try to reuse your mcts on other board games (bandas is an easy one). Tackling other problems will give you food for thought
 miszu: oh yeah, I am done with UTTT
 miszu: it was a fun ride
 miszu: learned mcts and coefficient factor tweaking
 miszu: and some optimizations
 darkhorse64: Nah, it's just the beginning
 miszu: :P
 darkhorse64: Still lots of CP to collect
 miszu: my bot is in top 100 in legends
 darkhorse64: Fine start
 YodaMaster123: How do you decide what you explore at the beginning? Is it at random or tailored to beat certain AIs?
 miszu: which game?
 struct: not sure if i keep the mirror

 KrisztianToth: Hey guys!
 YodaMaster123: MCTS miszu
 YodaMaster123: For Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
 struct: only top players have opening books
 struct: and not all of them
 ZarthaxX: holy fuck struct
 ZarthaxX: that'z amazing
 struct: thanks
 YodaMaster123: What is it? 
 struct: a game im porting to codingame
 tomatoes: i think he's about newly created (first visit) nodes, not book
 YodaMaster123: No tomatoes, I`m talking about your starting point. The opening books.
 struct: i dont think im gonna use the pharaoh theme thoug
 tomatoes: i have only teccles and copypaste smits response to teccles 
 miszu: YodaMaster123, do teccle then MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: hi structi think the mirror looks a bit confusing. showing parts of the board twice, hard to recognize as a mirror
 <b>**eulerscheZahl gets easily confused at shopping malls</b></p><p><img src="/a/45097182899192" /> struct: yeah I have to agree
 struct: euler I Think i know how to fix the bug you have
 struct: of cubes disapearing
 eulerscheZahl: not cubes. just surfaces
 eulerscheZahl: so, what's your suggestion?
 struct: whats you near value on perpectiveCamera?
 eulerscheZahl: uh, 0.1 i think
 struct: oh&#160;:/
 struct: hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, it's 0.1
 eulerscheZahl: whatever, now it's RAIC time
 struct: the surfaces of the cubes disapear?
 struct: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: tshirt + hoodie of last year finally arrived today :D
 eulerscheZahl: just 11 months
 struct: whats the prize this year?
 eulerscheZahl: 360 tshirts
 tomatoes: money
 eulerscheZahl: 60 hoodies
 eulerscheZahl: and money
 eulerscheZahl: no laptops and smart watches
 miszu: in codingame or something else?/
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://russianaicup.ru/">https://russianaicup.ru/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: where did the prize section go? was curious how much money
 eulerscheZahl: last year there was a picture with prizes on the start page. but only showed when you were not logged in
 Astrobytes: prizes listed on here euler:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mailru/blog/530232/">https://habr.com/ru/company/mailru/blog/530232/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo registered too
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, looks like you have submiyyed already&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: thanks astro. that's where i saw it
 eulerscheZahl: yes. just a pimped starter AI
 eulerscheZahl: with some building
 dbf: :thumbsup:
 wlesavo: t-shirt right in time to motivate euler to submit :smiley:
 Astrobytes: grats on finally receiving it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 250k rubels for the winnerabout 3200 US dollar
 struct: quite high prize
 eulerscheZahl: i'm here for the swag only :D
 Astrobytes: lol, euler's yearly shopping list
 eulerscheZahl: as always: minimum effort to get a hoodie
 struct: Must be stressfull playing for top
 struct: with 30 days competition
 wlesavo: yeah, just downloaded assets, was rewriting cg sponsored, still hope to make it to top3, seems quite doable now that i have beamsearch and can tune specific cases
 eulerscheZahl: last year i failed on the minimum effort part
 eulerscheZahl: you have the validators for CG sponsored?
 wlesavo: no, but i have assert :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: submit spam to extract info? :D
 Astrobytes: you saved all the maps?
 eulerscheZahl: it was way easier in the past. but i missed to do it
 wlesavo: smth like that, buyt maps and behaviour can be fully extracted from tests
 eulerscheZahl: same maps for validators?
 wlesavo: y
 eulerscheZahl: same starting positions?
 Astrobytes: nice
 wlesavo: no, starting positions and sleep times are the main difference
 eulerscheZahl: *sigh*
 wlesavo: and one case with 5 enemies
 eulerscheZahl: wow
 wlesavo: beam search is quite ok, but requires close to perfect sim, blitz is really close to optimum score though
 wlesavo: max i could get on most cases is a little above 1300 and 1300*11 = 14300
 miszu: which next ai game should I work on?
 wlesavo: oware is also nice for mcts
 miszu: I am tired of mcts haha
 miszu: ghost in the cell, how hard to reach legend?
 jrke: dots and boxes my favourite miszu
 wlesavo: well it does not work there the same way, you need early terminations with eval
 wlesavo: also there are some great optims, i would advise for 2048 and number shifting
 wlesavo: oh, and same game
 eulerscheZahl: ghost in the cell is an easy legend
 miszu: thanks. I was looking at the ghost one.
 miszu: It is a nice one because it is about ressource management. Never practiced that before
 therealbeef: is MCTS the main viable algo for UTTT legend?
 miszu: therealbeef it allowed me to reach legend
 struct: some  people did minimax to get legend
 therealbeef: sounds like it's rare&#160;;-)
 miszu: teccle + mcts is enough
 struct: even mcts is enough
 AshKetchum: what is teccle
 wlesavo: moves that make the opponent to play on the same board you made your last play
 AshKetchum: got it
 AshKetchum: thanks
 therealbeef: started with minimax, was just wondering if i have a chance at legend
 therealbeef: but even if its rare, i'll take the challenge&#160;:-)
 therealbeef: best way to learn
 miszu: therealbeef my advice is make sure you code the board state and transitions moves correctly
 miszu: then after it's easy to implement different algorithms
 struct: i think current rank 31 is still minimax
 struct: on uttt
 ZacDonald: somebody know on C4L if the id at the laboratory is the same as the diagnosis&#160;?
 miszu: ZacDonald not sure but can't you print out in the error stream?
 llks: Hola!
 llks: Any recommended puzzles to learn MCTS?
 llks: *easy ones to start with
 miszu: UTTT
 miszu: good luck
 llks: Ty
 abdomokh: HOLA
 abdomokh: WHAT IS MCTS
 abdomokh: ,
 struct: monte carlo tree search
 miszu: I thought it was Carlos
 Astrobytes: Mister Carlo's Tongue Scraper
 abdomokh: Ty
 ZarthaxX: carlos :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: it comes from the casino name mmis
 ZarthaxX: miszu
 miszu: yeah I realised that now
 miszu: I thought maybe there was a Prof. Carlos who came up with it
 Astrobytes: Monty Carlos' Flying Circus
 ZarthaxX: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
 ZarthaxX: im gonna die
 Astrobytes: lol
 meh1001: every turn is something completely different!

 VizGhar: maybe you didn't take&#160;? into account?
 ningelsohn: somehow a @ gets displayed as a&#160;? and thats fine (at least the test still passes)
 VizGhar: there is&#160;? as last ascii, that you should use if some charactes is not [a-z]
 ningelsohn: is this mentioned somewhere? i was thinking of that, but thanks, i will give it another try

 ToshiTuringMachine: hi nerds
 tobk: Weird. Trying to optimize my Poker chip Race collision detection. Instead of comparing each Chip with each other, I use two TreeSets (Java/Kotlin) for X and Y position and then use those to get the intersection of subsets of chips that are within two radii of the current Chip.
 tobk: I thought that would be super-fast, but it's 3-5 times slower than brute-force comparing all combinations...&#160;:-/
 ToshiTuringMachine: i stopped using all lambdas in java because the for(int i=0...) version is 12x faster
 ToshiTuringMachine: no surprise
 tobk: hm, good point, there are indeed a few lambda's in the code, Kotlin though, not sure how it behaves there.
 AlmightyStopwatch_71e9: sh
 travisfw: ToshiTuringMachine, even after JIT compilation? I'm new to the platform, but does JIT optimization work here? or do we not get enough time for it to "warm up"
 ToshiTuringMachine: sorry no idea. I just stopped using java 2 yrs ago
 Astrobytes: you get 1s first turn in multis, puzzles should be OK time-wise. afaik it's worth doing some manual warmup in that 1s
 travisfw: interesting Astrobytes. so like, hard-code a test case and loop it for a second I guess...
 Astrobytes: yeah, or create a bunch of instances of some dummy classes
 VizGhar: Just looking at nintendo puzzle... And I'm really puzzled o.O its something
 Astrobytes: It's quite a highly specialised mathematical problem, I have no real idea
 tobk: hm, tried converting all those .filter{...} to loop+if, but only marginal speed up, and comparing all pairs still much faster than using the tree sets...
 jacek: wooo new puzzle of the week
 miszu: does optimization matters for ghost in the cell?
 struct: dont think so
 ToshiTuringMachine: lovely puzzle of the week... thanks illedan
 ToshiTuringMachine: a milestone
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: Hello everyone
 LastRick: Yep I'm enjoying it. Just can't get the last one in time yet.
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: I just barely started playing around here
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: And been solving the Power of thor task
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: Solved it but I can't understand one thing
 LastRick: Its fun when you first start. Like I said above, my controls were so wonky, poor guy looked drunk
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: If something is higher on Y line than obviously thor has to move North
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: and here its opposite
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: how the ... is that possible
 Astrobytes: Origin is usually top-left on CG
 VizGhar: most of the time in programming y=0 is top&#160;:)
 VizGhar: and if you are referring to directions, you should use LTRB
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: Gotcha, I was just reffering to task conditions 
 TheNoiselessPony_7a5e: Thank you guys
 Astrobytes: no worries
 struct: miszu race to legend?
 jacek: oh heas already legend in uttt, noice
 miszu: struct for ghost in cell?
 struct: yes
 miszu: jacek yeah I hit legend today&#160;:)
 miszu: struct Rush B it is
 miszu: but I am burned from the UTTT
 struct: I think gitc is the hardest multi for m
 struct: me*
 miszu: euler said it is easy to reach legend
 miszu: we shall see then
 struct: hmm maybe I do the contribution instead :thinking:
 Astrobytes: struct, your clip of your contrib looked amazing. Agree with euler on no mirror effect though
 struct: thanks it will be slow progress though
 struct: Not really familiar with 3d stuff
 Astrobytes: take your time man, there's no rush
 Astrobytes: nice to have you back again btw struct&#160;;)
 struct: thanks astro, glad to be back
 Sinux1: I am starting to use this sit emore for fun (in reality, to practice coding in specific languages), but is there a way to work in my own ide, with the same game parameters, so that I can write and run them locally?
 Astrobytes: For multis or puzzles Sinux1?
 Sinux1: I am not sure the difference between the two, but I think the right answer is the puzzles. I have been trying to follow the quest map
 Astrobytes: Multiplayers are the bot programming, optim and code golf kinda come under that umbrella as they have leaderboard, clashes then you have single player puzzles
 Sinux1: ok, I have been doing the single player puzzles
 Astrobytes: Puzzle-wise you can take the test cases (if they are visible) and run offline with them as your input
 Sinux1: but if they are not visible?
 Astrobytes: You can print the input to stderr and copy that way
 Sinux1: ok
 struct: If you dont have expert mode enable do it
 Sinux1: that works for me
 Astrobytes: +1 for struct's comment
 struct: The puzzles that dont show inputs are the ones that change depending on your output
 Sinux1: ill do it now
 Astrobytes: Also, you can't get the validators for puzzles (the test cases you get on submitting your code)
 struct: to enable expert mode click on ide settings on left 
 Sinux1: haha I was about to type "how?"
 Sinux1: ty
 Sinux1: Thank you so much
 Astrobytes: then if test cases are visible you'll see a menu icon 'display test cases', and under 'Custom' you can define your own too
 Sinux1: I just figured that out! wow. Okay, I see it all now, This ANEO sponsored puzzle was really aggravating. With this, I can get some stuff done. 
 Astrobytes: Ah, good stuff&#160;:)
 Sinux1: haha this is going to really reduce the amount of time i study for my finals this week... ttyl. 
 Astrobytes: Hey, prioritize! ttyl
 Sinux1: is there an irc channel?
 Sinux1: im using this off the side of the site ... is this the discord?
 Astrobytes: this is it technically, XMPP. There;s the discord link up top
 Astrobytes: The two are different
 Astrobytes: Both can be quiet at times, but discord is good for longer discussions
 jacek: irc? what year is it
 Astrobytes: hey, it still works
 Sinux1: at least you didnt ask what irc is
 Sinux1: i like it, i use. discords cool too. 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, here and discord are my 'social media'
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm done for tonight. See you all tomorrow

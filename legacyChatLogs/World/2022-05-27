 PatrickMcGinnisII: could overload session variables, oh a use for php
 eulerscheZahl: even if we pull it off: i don't think that many users would use it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: even if/when chat goes down, peepz will just discord
 Westicles: when is mid june.  too many people have discord blocked at work, the fr were talking about chatting elsewhere
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my dev site incrreased their security... they intentionally scan my scripts as malware to piss me off.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I coded user data on one of my sites into a block text file, so I can greasemonkey email blast if I have to... they flagged them.  Shut down my customer for 3 days until I spent 3 hours on the phone bitching at them.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: They apparently didn't like the fact they couldn't unencrypt my data for themselves.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gnite

 waterproofsodium: 4899 CP in clash :_(
 waterproofsodium: place 1004 sigh
 waterproofsodium: it just won't let me enter pro league xD
 Ajaiy: Automaton2000 do you think your job is tiring?
 Automaton2000: i am not sure how i would do it
 gokubill: hi 
 aCat: hello
 LOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX: hello
 waterproofsodium: I'm 4900 CP next day safe&#160;:)
 jacek: :tada:
 blop200: how long does it take for one to reach "legendary" status on clash of codes? 
 blop200: I mean I look at some programmers here and they are so fast and efficient. I am wondering how long it would take to code to reach those sort of skills
 blop200: or is it only attainable for certain gifted individuals
 waterproofsodium: aw ty jacek
 waterproofsodium: blop200 are you strating from scratch?
 blop200: i'm a first year comp sci student who's currently mostly studying c++ 
 waterproofsodium: if you are not new to programming I would guess you can get to it in 1-2 years. but I've not been there :P
 blop200: hmm that's interesting, I hope that's the case
 waterproofsodium: I think you could make it. I think it requires to dedicade quite some time tho
 waterproofsodium: I mean if you're into it. I am confident that you can achieve it definitely at the end of your degree
 jacek: c++ isnt popular in clashes
 waterproofsodium: but in cp&#160;;)
 M3M0: negri di merda
 blop200: maybe I should learn a new language like phyton?
 waterproofsodium: use the language that makes sense for you
 waterproofsodium: don't change a language because it's more convenient for some "online practice"
 blop200: yeah you're right
 M3M0: porco dio 
 blop200: maybe mastering one language first is a good idea before heading over to other languages
 blop200: althought "mastering" is a very abstract term
 blop200: you can technically never master something even though you have been studying it for 40 years or longer
 waterproofsodium: lets see how much more features they add to C++ the next 40 years :P
 blop200: hahhahah
 waterproofsodium: can't master something that is changing faster than you're learning
 waterproofsodium: but gotta be able to use C++ without mastering it
 waterproofsodium: if not the language will die soon enough
 waterproofsodium: (not saying that is the case)
 waterproofsodium: c++42.. that has a ring to it 8)
 jacek: computer science is more about algorithmic thinking, language agnostic
 waterproofsodium: jacek: I'm stuck on "win 3 shortest clashes" :D
 waterproofsodium: for 2 weeks now ig
 jacek: no wonder if you use c++ for that :v
 waterproofsodium: haha na C#
 waterproofsodium: same problem tho
 jacek: C# is even more verbose
 Ajaiy: C# is my base language too
 Ajaiy: but I tried to learn Python3, and it was very nice for shortest
 Ajaiy: Ruby, Perl, etc. are like the gods of shortest, out of which I know only 0.1% of Ruby
 jacek: and you colleagues will love it when you write shortest incomprehensible code
 Dren: when you have three line long statement with mapped dictionary comprehensions of zipped list comprehensions with multiple assignment to reference the list inside itself because it just makes sense that way
 Uljahn: you mean it's impossible to break it down in any meaningful way? i'd like to see this example
 waterproofsodium: beaten by baby yoda&#160;:(
 b0ot: anyone know why in ruby my strings always seem to have extra " marks
 b0ot: insteady of "foobar"

 mr_sam01: Hi
 Lynch[0]: can someone tell how to fix EOF error
 Lynch[0]: in python
 vknue: send bob pls
 vknue: send bob and vagene
 ToastyBreadsicle: is there a way to choose only code golf challenges in clash of code? without creating a private room that is
 jacek: no
 ToastyBreadsicle: aw shucks i like those&#160;:(
 5DN1L: Lynch[0] correct your code to fix EOF. check whether everything opened has been closed (e.g. brackets)
 Lynch[0]: can someone tell how to fix this:
 Lynch[0]: EOFError: EOF when reading a line
 jacek: is this some puzzle
 Lynch[0]: yeah ascii art
 jacek: youre doing more input() than neccessary
 5DN1L: oh i thought he was asking about "unexpected EOF while parsing"&#160;:(
 Lynch[0]: nope it was about reading a line
 Lynch[0]: i only passed the first test and every other tests are showing that error
 Python1234: WHY I CAN'T USE STRIP() (python)
 5DN1L: what's your code
 TINOUAINANI: hi, whay my python Certification show 96%, i solved all the problems
 5DN1L: is this the first time you took the test?
 TINOUAINANI: yes
 5DN1L: you have full score?
 5DN1L: i mean the validators may be different from the test cases
 TINOUAINANI: oh, ok thanks
 Yuhiii: hey
 Yuhiii: let num = 255let num = num + num++
 Yuhiii: can someone explain me what wrong&#160;? (javascript)
 TINOUAINANI: num = 255 + 255 right&#160;?
 5DN1L: SyntaxError: Identifier 'num' has already been declaredat Answer.js. on line 2
 5DN1L: don't let twice
 Yuhiii: "Apply the increment operator to num"
 Yuhiii: that's why i make it twice
 5DN1L: just "let" the first time
 5DN1L: this works:
 5DN1L: let num = 255num = num + num++console.log(num)
 5DN1L: at least without error
 5DN1L: not sure if that's what you want, though
 Yuhiii: ohhh
 Yuhiii: yea it's what i want lmfao
 Yuhiii: tysm
 5DN1L: np
 Yuhiii: error is i put twice&#160;;-;
 Yuhiii: tysm
 Python1234: TINOUAINANI
 Python1234: n = input()
 Python1234: *input = "H1a23l6l597e0y"
 5DN1L: you can copy and paste the whole code here
 Python1234: ok
 Python1234: import sysimport maths = input()print(s.strip('0123456789'))
 Python1234: goal is remove all the number
 Python1234: it just print the whole input again
 Python1234: id understand
 Ayza: It's because you are looking for 0123456789
 Ayza: not all numbers from 0 to 9
 Ayza: nvm mb just tested it in the console
 Ayza: what's the input you are given
 Python1234: i lost it
 Python1234: but it kind of letter and number
 Python1234: "H1a23l6l597e0y"
 Ayza: well what I conclude from testing is the strip function will only remove the numbers from the start and the end
 Ayza: I suggest using replace instead
 Python1234: thx
 Ayza: np

 Ajaiy: jacek: do you put random stuff on purpose?
 jacek: what random stuff
 Ajaiy: Like putting very hard puzzles as a recommendation for a beginner
 jacek: no, its autonomic reflex
 Ajaiy: was that supposed to be sarcastic?
 jacek: no :upside_down:
 Ajaiy: ok then? ðŸ˜•
 5DN1L: automatic reflex means an if-then-else that takes less than 1 ms to execute
 Ajaiy: I wonder how jacek has an autonomic reflex for every situation
 5DN1L: he has a super neuron network?
 Ajaiy: I mean, even bots like Automaton2000 can't handle that big of a network
 Automaton2000: thanks for letting me know

 Ajaiy: is it a bug or a feature?
 5DN1L: feature i guess
 5DN1L: facilitate change of difficulty level if needed
 Ajaiy: Yeah ig
 Ajaiy: it works for all the puzzles
 Ajaiy: btw what is the coolest one-liner you have seen in a clash of code or somewhere?
 jacek: print(input().title())
 jacek: for a clash that wanted capital letter at every word
 jacek: so "I like cats" becomes "I Like Cats"
 GNye22: Does anyone know why when you minimize functions or classes, they seem to randomly open back up when typing? even when there's no mention of the class in what you're typing?
 jacek: dunno, I rarely use site's IDE
 Uljahn: GNye22: CG uses Microsoft's Monaco Editor, which has a lot of configuration options, you can alter them in the settings on the left-side panel
 GNye22: Oh, I was unaware that was there. Would you happen to know how I could keep the IDE from automatically uncondensing my methods and classes?

 antiwonto: [auto] hey Wontonimo. I'm a bot :robot:
 jacek: :taco: derjack
 antiwonto: [auto] Spread the love.  Give tacos to someone else, not someone you spam with tacos.
 jacek: :rage:
 Wontonimo: yeah, like me.  you haven't give me tacos recently&#160;!
 derjack: :taco: Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [auto] derjack has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 35 taco. derjack now has 58 taco

 Wontonimo: :taco: jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded jacek 10 tacos. jacek now has 42 taco. Wontonimo now has 36 taco
 jacek: what does 'error' mean in NNs? so far ive been doing mse (i think) only. what would i need to change in the xor example, to decrease the mean absolute error for specifically? or i got this wrong
 Wontonimo: yeah, you could use mean square error MSE for XOR.  An alternate is logistic softmax
 Wontonimo: as for  "error" in NNs, I don't know what you mean.  more info plz 
 Wontonimo: maybe we could make a colab notebook to talk about this?
 jacek: you have huber loss, absolute error etc.
 Wontonimo: here is a XOR demo notebook i made a while ago <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iZ1ZWjQHXBNZBOa-ZxX8SSOoiwFjCIcD?usp=sharing">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iZ1ZWjQHXBNZBOa-ZxX8SSOoiwFjCIcD?usp=sharing</a>
 jacek: im not theory guy, i half mindlessly copied pieces here and there to get working solution
 jacek: what if i wanted to decrease huber loss specifically, not (only) mse?
 jacek: if my question makes sense
 Wontonimo: no problem, write a new loss function
 Wontonimo: want help doing that?
 jacek: without libs?
 Wontonimo: using keras and tensorflow
 jacek: its all there, just import stuff. its easy
 jacek: in my xor example, im doing (target - output) stuff. then it is decreasing mse specifically?
 Wontonimo: i'd have to see your code to answer 
 Wontonimo: link?
 jacek: probably you wonder how could i come this far using NNs without knowing them
 Wontonimo: no, totally seems reasonable actually
 Wontonimo: custom losses are kinda niche for fine tuning 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/axkMYBm">https://tech.io/snippet/axkMYBm</a>
 jacek: what would i change for custom loss, like MAE or other simple loss
 Wontonimo: OH, you are not using tensorflow and keras
 Wontonimo: so, you'd have to compute the derivative of your loss function
 Wontonimo: if you made a new one
 jacek: :scream:

 bubba1: damn i mistyped which cost me like 20 seconds
 jacek: derive to 20 seconds, ezpz
 Ajaiy: When you try to code something simple to humans, such as finding what number is handwritten, that's when you feel so gifted to do such things easily

 jacek: oO
 Ajaiy: Automaton2000 do you think you will be successful in rickrolling someone?
 Automaton2000: i like how you can do something like this in the rules
 Ajaiy: i mean, the rules never forbade rickrolls
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: is it the Moon or a yellow traffic light?
 Automaton2000: not sure if you are good enough
 jacek: DomiKo why do i get repeated games from you :thinking:
 jacek: youre so predictable
 SUwUn: I was stuck on a test case but when I submit it was 100%. lol wtf
 SUwUn: I hate that

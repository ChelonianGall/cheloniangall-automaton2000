 Westicles: Solving Vox Codei 2 and struggling with ASCII art is how he knows
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;:(
 gggsfjw: whats the best thing to learn first in python?
 Illedan: Good morning
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, how is that contest going?
 eulerscheZahl: that's how, Illedan<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/replay/ai0gvj2ao2l7">https://yare.io/replay/ai0gvj2ao2l7</a>
 eulerscheZahl: devs don't see an issue, will just increase the HP of the base from 5 to 8. which doesn't matter when I destroy all enemy units
 eulerscheZahl: you can play 3 different shapes. squares can rush the other 2
 Illedan: Lol, rushing is just that strong
 Illedan: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: Zeeerrrggg!!!!
 eulerscheZahl: a more serious gameplay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/replay/ncggvu0111q4">https://yare.io/replay/ncggvu0111q4</a>
 Illedan: Only rushing if close?
 eulerscheZahl: i have a rush vs other shapes. but disabled that feature on the 2nd replay
 NinjaDoggy: is yare.io fun? :D
 eulerscheZahl: not really searchable, more of a heuristic contest. probably some rock paper scissors
 eulerscheZahl: hard to test, as you can only fight against opponents that are online and 2 test bots that aren't completely stupid
 eulerscheZahl: it's not a full bot game
 eulerscheZahl: you can update your code during the match. and even add some UI elements to interact, if you want
 eulerscheZahl: to give commands via clicking or whatever you can think of
 eulerscheZahl: but <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/tournament">https://yare.io/tournament</a>
 eulerscheZahl: huge prizepool
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 eulerscheZahl: too late to join now. the contest was linked on CG discord. that's how I found it
 NinjaDoggy: not too interested anyways :P
 NinjaDoggy: gonna spend some time learning CGZero to prep for fall contest&#160;;)
 Illedan: date launched?
 eulerscheZahl: i like your optimism
 eulerscheZahl: no date yet
 eulerscheZahl: toad prediction date: November 11th
 NinjaDoggy: doesn't really matter anyways right
 NinjaDoggy: as long as it's not cancelled it'll be 2 a year
 NinjaDoggy: longer wait = shorter wait for next one :P
 BlaiseEbuth: You think CGZero will works for cgescape?&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i'll link it again, should bookmark it<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/solo-contests/1114/3">https://forum.codingame.com/t/solo-contests/1114/3</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's what I meant with "optimism"
 NinjaDoggy: Doesn't CGZero work for literally any game if you write a simulation + search algo that makes use of an eval function :P
 NinjaDoggy: even if it's not MCTS there's no reason why you can't train it on just game state -&gt; win rate right?

 NinjaDoggy:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: we speculate that the next contest might be an escape room and not a bot game
 NinjaDoggy: pls no...
 NinjaDoggy: surely 2 multis a year isn't too much to ask for&#160;:(

 NinjaDoggy: the wild conspiracy theory is seeming more likely&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and RAIC will be delayed until February
 Fenris.: escape room? what's that like?
 eulerscheZahl: go to youtube, search for "codingame escape room"(might contain spoilers)
 eulerscheZahl: you are supposed to play these with a group of multiple people. as a team
 Justin-Truong: play escape room?
 ProCoder03: yup..
 Justin-Truong: could you invite me
 Fenris.: is it any good for newbs? I'm not exactly a full newb but I have not been coding for quite a while.
 eulerscheZahl: the escape rooms require less coding skills than clashes
 Justin-Truong: yeah
 Fenris.: okay cool
 Serpi90: i hate shortest mode clashes
 Fenris.: how and when can I try it out?
 Justin-Truong: i played with myself clash all of this afternoon
 ProCoder03: Its just a harder reverse...
 Serpi90: nah, they are useless in real life
 Serpi90: and you end up doing dirty hacks to use 2 less characters
 eulerscheZahl: just go to activites-&gt;cooperate at the navigation bar at the top
 Justin-Truong: nah the hardest for me is fastest
 eulerscheZahl: and find some friends willing to play with you
 Serpi90: i don't hate them because they are hard, i hate them because they are pointless
 ProCoder03: or go to discord channel for CGescape
 Justin-Truong: is it hard
 ProCoder03: what's hard&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: right. i muted that discord channel the second it was created
 Fenris.: thanks

 Justin-Truong: play coding escape
 0ffset: Hi I have a doubt regarding the dice puzle
 eulerscheZahl: which of them?
 eulerscheZahl: dice duel? codindice?
 eulerscheZahl: probability dice?
 BlaiseEbuth: Miami dice
 BlaiseEbuth: Dice city
 0ffset: The probability dice
 0ffset: The thing is that i dont get to fully understand the fact that they want something that follows a normal distribution...
 eulerscheZahl: do you know what normal distribution is?
 0ffset: yes, but isn't it overcomplicating things?
 0ffset: otherwise i guess i'm not fully understanding the problem
 eulerscheZahl: it's not totally trivial to solve, if that's what you ask
 0ffset: the point is that i know what a normal distribution is but i dont know how to implement it
 eulerscheZahl: how I solved it:when I see d6, i generate 6 strings: "1", "2", "3", ... to replace it
 eulerscheZahl: then evaluate each of them
 0ffset: that's way more trivial that what i imagined
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible that the substituted string still has mode "d"s in it. in this case i will recursively replace those too
 eulerscheZahl: too me a total of 18 lines in python (including 2 empty lines and an import)
 0ffset: okay, i guess that I'm overcomplicating things then 
 geppoz: or you can use qbits :D
 jzen: Is it possible to reopen a closed clash chat?
 Justin-Truong: yes
 Justin-Truong: oh no
 eulerscheZahl: yes. open the clash itself again
 eulerscheZahl: you can find it in your last notifications
 geppoz: it's saturday, so why not to talk bad of js&#160;?
 geppoz: someone can explain me why that split() limit is so silly in js?
 geppoz: any brained would have implemented it as: "after the limit, return remaining in last element"
 geppoz: not just "throw away the remaining"
 geppoz: or it is just me?
 MiyamuraIzumi: so the point is "limit meaning"
 geppoz: yes, and his usefulness in that silly way
 MiyamuraIzumi: why do you think that others will think like you
 geppoz: since serious languages, like java, think like me :D
 MiyamuraIzumi: not really
 geppoz: ofc if I want just first elements, I can slice()
 Ocho: can someone help me with C?
 geppoz: the usefulness is to stop the parsing
 geppoz: not just throw the remainder
 geppoz: hi ocho , try to ask, let's see if someone can
 Ocho: appreciate it 
 geppoz: MiyamuraIzumi you don't think that, implementing in "my way" you will have all needed cases, and nothing less and something more?
 MiyamuraIzumi: as always
 MiyamuraIzumi: those support javascript will say
 MiyamuraIzumi: why Java is doing like that
 geppoz: you have the stop of the parsing, if the problem is the computational weight, so you can just after take only the first elements if you want, but you will also have the remainder, so you can do more things
 MiyamuraIzumi: it make the last element of split not really following what they expected
 geppoz: because you have more thing at same price, and nothing less
 geppoz: on the contrary, if you want to do something with the remainder, you are in trouble, since you don't have where to start
 MiyamuraIzumi: so as what say, it's depend on the pov of the language designer
 MiyamuraIzumi: or api designer to be extract
 geppoz: well, you can't just say "that's my pov", there are better pov than others
 geppoz: I'm just sayng, for me, that's not an useful pov 
 geppoz: express yourself freely, that's a friendly environment :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Everybody can have his opinion. But I'm the one who's right.
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 geppoz: ofc
 MiyamuraIzumi: i am not the author, but I think that not everyone will suport Java idea
 BlaiseEbuth: Or even Java
 MiyamuraIzumi: they api just meaning, I want to split this string with this limit
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes
 MiyamuraIzumi: so maybe javascript say, so it is limit =&gt; the out of lime will be truncate as what "limit" always be
 littlebear: when I refresh sometimes I am losing some chats 
 MiyamuraIzumi: so "limit" again 
 eulerscheZahl: entire chat rooms or history of single rooms?
 MiyamuraIzumi: haha
 littlebear: clash chats
 MiyamuraIzumi: even private chat
 MiyamuraIzumi: only store some of the recents
 MiyamuraIzumi: just a bit
 MiyamuraIzumi: so MCTS share some characteristic of negamax, is this correct?
 MiyamuraIzumi: can anyone help me on this?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I mean MCTS sovlver
 eulerscheZahl: have some demo code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg">https://tech.io/snippet/UGXgTEg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: formula at line 100 is wrong, should use the direct parent instead of root node for N
 eulerscheZahl: afk lunchtime
 ProCoder03: what is the difference between MCTS and MCTS solver&#160;??
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank you
 BlaiseEbuth: solver
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am leaning solver
 MiyamuraIzumi: so I don't really know for now
 ProCoder03: :unamused: Ikt BlaiseEbuth
 ProCoder03: Okay

 sprkrd: And I've been pastebinned&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: Thank you sprkrd
 ProCoder03: :joy:
 sprkrd: just search for MCTS solver and you'll find the paper
 ProCoder03: OK...
 ProCoder03: LoA means Line of Attack, right&#160;?? and what does it mean&#160;?? 
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.ru.is/faculty/yngvi/pdf/WinandsBS08.pdf">http://www.ru.is/faculty/yngvi/pdf/WinandsBS08.pdf</a>
 ProCoder03: I am new to these algos :sweat_smile:
 sprkrd: As far as I known there's just one paper describing it, and then very small references to it in other papers (the classic references you do to fill the "Related work" section of the paper without paying too much attention to it), so I don't think MCTS solver is a raging success, at least yet. However, it can tell you (in some instances) whether you're following a path that leads to victory or to defeat
 sprkrd: Yeah, LoA = Lines of Attack
 ProCoder03: "whether you're following a path that leads to victory or to defeat" Wow...... Seems Interesting....
 sprkrd: It's the thing some people use to set the messages of their bots to something like a smiley face if they know they're gonna win of to a frowny face if they're gonna lose :joy:
 ProCoder03: sounds cool :sunglasses:
 sprkrd: Btw, LoA = Lines of Action, I got carried away before
 ProCoder03: yeah.. you mentioned it...
 sprkrd: No, I said Lines of Attack
 sprkrd: it's not attack, it's Action
 ProCoder03: Ohhh.....
 ProCoder03: what does it mean&#160;??
 sprkrd: dunno, don't know the game. It seems somewhat similar to Othello? Never cared enough to learn the rules
 ProCoder03: Its game related!! Okay Thanks sprkrd
 duckymirror: I just did a Clash of Code where nobody got more than 25%. Can I look at the solution the author uploaded?
 JBM: the answer to the question doesn't depend on the sentence before it
 ProCoder03: You can't 
 duckymirror: Hmm. Okay, thanks!
 BlaiseEbuth: You can...
 BlaiseEbuth: If you pkayed enough clashs
 BlaiseEbuth: *played
 duckymirror: Do you know how many that is?
 ProCoder03: is it 500 clashes, BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes.
 duckymirror: That's a lot. I'm going to do a few then. 😀
 duckymirror: *a few more
 _NikJ: How on earth did these people solve Temperatures in 29-30 characters? And Chuck Norris within 50 characters? o.o
 ProCoder03: That's the art of code golfing&#160;!!
 ProCoder03: writing shorter but uglier code...
 _NikJ: No, I get THAT.
 _NikJ: But 29 characters?
 _NikJ: Come on
 _NikJ: How do you take input and solve it within 29 chars lol
 ProCoder03: Bash..??
 geppoz: the only "cheat" I found in that, is when they write some language solution as "exec" of a bash
 geppoz: that ruins real competition in a language
 ProCoder03: you mean running another language from bash
 geppoz: no, i mean exec bash from any language
 geppoz: so you have one short bash solution, and use in all languages
 geppoz: (or almost all, which have "exec" command)
 ProCoder03: ohhh.... I thought it was the other way around....
 _NikJ: Yeah.. I mean, doesn't seem legit that code that in 30 chars in C no less
 ProCoder03: Now, 30 chars in C is not even legit...
 ProCoder03: The include and main itself will come to around 15 chars
 _NikJ: you don't need includes
 _NikJ: but yes, idk how :d
 ProCoder03: how will printf work without stdio.h
 _NikJ: I guess the validators used to be much weaker before, so that even "wrong" solutions would pass them all
 _NikJ: It can be done in C
 _NikJ: you can write main(){printf("hi");} and it will work as expected
 ProCoder03: What!! Then why does GCC throws an error when I try it locally
 _NikJ: probably a compiler flag
 _NikJ: here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2199076/printf-and-scanf-work-without-stdio-h-why">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2199076/printf-and-scanf-work-without-stdio-h-why</a>
 ProCoder03: will check 
 ProCoder03: Thanks
 _NikJ: but anyways, yeah, the input+the algorithm in like 30 chars in C? :open_mouth:
 ProCoder03: Impossible, Unless He is a master in it...
 ProCoder03: *He/She
 _NikJ: I actually think it's this " guess the validators used to be much weaker before, so that even "wrong" solutions would pass them all"*pasted from above*
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a rerun when validators are modified.
 Westicles: It isn't clear how one becomes a state-of-the-art golfer in bash.  Lots of weird, undocumented knowledge involved
 BlaiseEbuth: HCF
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 sprkrd: "state-of-the-art golfer" sounds way too serious, like it will have any implication in computer science
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan in chat. of course he's submitting FB
 Westicles: I would put bash golf high on the list of the last things human outperform machine intelligences
 EngineHeart: how to make the console to give all the output&#160;???
 Rag3ar0ck: hello
 MSmits: damn i hate it when this happens, bug on release, but not in debug mode. I am guessing it's an uninitialized var somewhere
 struct: Hi
 MSmits: hi
 Illedan: Always eulerscheZahl
 Illedan: Had a major bug, which kinda worked out xD
 MSmits: i was not returning from an expansion function... oops
 MSmits: only c++ thinks thats fine
 MSmits: debug mode makes it return 0 i guess
 jacek: ohai
 struct: hi jacek
 MSmits: hi jacek
 struct: you are working on Yavalath Msmits?
 jacek: welcome back, yavalath runner up
 MSmits: yeah applying some stuff i learned since that old version
 MSmits: I know jacek
 MSmits: thanks for the headsup
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: saw it a few days ago
 struct: im sure you learned a lot in that time
 MSmits: not a lot, but some things are helpful. Trying to get a better hashing scheme to work
 MSmits: was using unordered set
 MSmits: also, on expansion i was automatically reserving 61 - depth hexes. Which is a bit wasteful on forced moves
 MSmits: i kept instantly lost moves as children
 MSmits: so every time on selection, these were iterated over
 struct: why do you need to reserve hexes?
 MSmits: on the node pool
 MSmits: as children
 struct: ah 61 nodes
 MSmits: i basically had no expansion function, i just set a block of memory to 9
 MSmits: to 0
 MSmits: cheap on expansion, but expensive for selection
 MSmits: will be a while before I get anything working. I am adapting my local version + meta mcts before getting a new leaderboard version
 MSmits: oh btw, the expansion thingy i had before was terribly bad at finding chains of forced moves, because whenever a forced move happened, it would be something like 50 losses and 1 continued game, so that makes that move really unattractive to explore
 MSmits: now it just has 1 child so it can keep going
 struct: These little things should help
 MSmits: Yep. These NN's on Y are really RPS anyway. Royale had a bot that beat me and then Robo resubmitted and beat Royale harder than me
 MSmits: but I want to try getting an opening book that's not countering any specific player. I am kinda past that exercise
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: Y is the only game where i still have one of those
 MSmits: only thing I still do is that when it seems like my bot is not finding countermoves locally, I increase the exploration param
 MSmits: but that's similar to changing a NN hyperparam
 Jamez707: hi
 Jamez707: hru guys
 MSmits: hot russian guys?
 MSmits: I'm not russian
 Jamez707: what lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 MSmits: but hi Jamez707
 Jamez707: hi
 Jamez707: u play minecraft
 Jamez707: im bored
 MSmits: are you coming to codingame to pickup minecraft buddies
 MSmits:&#160;?
 struct: I don't
 Jamez707: imstuck soooo
 MSmits: I stopped playing minecraft. I was too awesome. Wasn't fair to everyone else
 Jamez707: ive just started learning java and i skipped a level by accident and now im stuck 
 Jamez707: lol 
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 MSmits: skip a java level?
 MSmits: how do you do that?
 BlaiseEbuth: Better skip java
 Jamez707: i dont know
 Jamez707: i kindof just happend
 MSmits: you were an accident?
 Jamez707: yes but so was the level skip
 MSmits: this convo is all over the place
 BlaiseEbuth: Condom for the win
 _Royale: MSmits: you are first on C4 now&#160;;)
 MSmits: oh, what did you do?
 MSmits: also congrats on all your NN success, are you still building on marchetes work? Or doing your own?
 _Royale: I pushed another NN that loses 100% against you
 Jamez707: invalid input. Expected 'x y power' but found '28000'
 MSmits: ahhh i see
 Jamez707: its saying that but its not in the code
 Jamez707: as far as i can see
 MSmits: you are outputting 28000 somehow, check the output i guess
 Jamez707: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ac6f74a-8075-4cc0-83ab-bd7a192631da">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ac6f74a-8075-4cc0-83ab-bd7a192631da</a>
 _Royale: MSmits: I still use my own version (no AVX) but learned a lot thanks to the community
 Jamez707: sorry its a link
 MSmits: ahh ok, well gj. Yeah community is great for this
 MSmits: Jamez707 you are just adding them all up before output
 MSmits: so it's a single number
 struct: you dont use avx on c4 _Royale?
 Jamez707: so should i change the 3000 and 9000
 MSmits: it should be nextcheckx + " " + nextchecky + " " + 100 or something
 MSmits: thrust being 100
 MSmits: the " " is to separate the output, because otherwise you're mathematically adding
 MSmits: struct he doesnt use avx in his NN framework, which he also uses on c4
 _Royale: struct: no I rely on auto vectorization
 struct: But you dont need a sim anyways MSmits?
 Jamez707: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bdb47ce4-5cac-4cfc-b31f-c0ad05f3c929">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bdb47ce4-5cac-4cfc-b31f-c0ad05f3c929</a>
 MSmits: ohh, you mean in the sim. I don't think that matters for NN's. Sim speed is not a bottleneck
 MSmits: very small speedup if you avx that part
 struct: ah I see
 struct: Jamez707 follow the tutorial
 Jamez707: i understan approximately 3 words of that
 Jamez707: i started like 2 hours ago
 MSmits: perhaps it's better to just do some easy puzzles
 MSmits: csb isnt the best tutorial
 MSmits: if easy puzzles don't work, then you're not ready to use java on CG
 Jamez707: it wont letme till ive done this
 MSmits: wait, do you know any language?
 MSmits: is java just a new language, or your first?
 Jamez707: do i sound like i do?
 MSmits: i don't know
 Jamez707: first
 MSmits: ok, well this is not a good place to learn your first language. It is a good place to practice using your first language though
 MSmits: assuming you already know the basics
 MSmits: but it seems like you're stuck on the basics
 Jamez707: um yeah
 MSmits: you need a real java tutorial
 Jamez707: i got told to start on this website
 MSmits: do you really need to learn java btw?
 MSmits: or can it be any language?
 MSmits: personally I like python and C# better for starting out
 Jamez707: i was told it was the best starter language
 MSmits: mmh, well that's an opinion I guess
 Jamez707: my source is a bit of an idiot tho
 Jamez707: r u on pc
 MSmits: yes
 struct: starting on this website might not be the wisest choice
 MSmits: the thing about coders is that they quickly forget how hard it was to learn the basics of their first language and to learn computational thinking
 MSmits: so it's easy to make the mistake of referring people to CG when they have no basis
 Jamez707: can we message on steam this is really glitchy for me
 Jamez707: makes sense
 MSmits: sorry, I only chat here
 struct: message on steam?
 Jamez707: thats fine
 MSmits: yeah steam has some chat thingy i guess
 struct: Yeah but why not use this chat?
 MSmits: well he's right that it can glitch sometimes
 Jamez707: bc it doesnt work very well 4 me
 struct: my recommendation is to learn the basics first 
 Jamez707: i will thanks guys
 Jamez707: i gtg walk my dog now anyway but another time
 MSmits: code.org is ok if you don't know any computational thinking at all, but may seem a bit childish to you. I kinda like it though
 MSmits: at least you'll be able to solve most of their exercises and they have minecraft stuff =)
 Jamez707: i dont care if its childish as long as it helps 
 Jamez707: thanks guys
 MSmits: will not help with written language, but with solving skills
 Jamez707: i will see you i dont know when
 MSmits: you can convert your block code to real code though
 MSmits: sure, have fun
 Jamez707: u too
 jacek: aww you made a new friend
 CoderSpeedRoll: WWWEWE
 eulerscheZahl: what's that? drunken Thor wandering around the map?

 MiyamuraIzumi: for GCC optimize?
 BlaiseEbuth: loops
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;:(

 MSmits: very minimalistic
 MSmits: no idea what it all means
 eulerscheZahl: it's a contest starting soon (qualification closed)
 eulerscheZahl: harvesting energy which you can use to build new units or attack the enemy
 eulerscheZahl: and it's somewhat interactive. you can change the code during the game. or even build your own UI for manual control
 MSmits: whoa... bots and manual combined?
 MSmits: thats new
 MSmits: this is what i need to get nr 1 at Y back&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't screeps similar?
 MSmits: dont know screeps
 BlaiseEbuth: Is it euler? Thought it was bot only
 MSmits: I can see this being useful for games with lots of logistics. Bot handles that part and big decisions can be handled by player manually
 eulerscheZahl: never played screeps myself
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder how the contest format will look like (details not determined yet)
 BlaiseEbuth: Me neither, the possibility to buy things sound too much "pay to win" for me
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't see why I should pay when I have CG as an alternative
 eulerscheZahl: with more language flexibility
 BlaiseEbuth: For now
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 jacek: you pay with a soul
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah...&#160;:/

 MSmits: different issue
 MSmits: Sayonara!
 eulerscheZahl: pay to play the game. and then just copy what others did
 eulerscheZahl: smart move, really :smirk:
 MSmits: yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: My concern is more about extra CPU you can buy.
 eulerscheZahl: that's like buying a PC game and then watching a youtube let's play instead of playing yourself
 MSmits: on community servers it is free BlaiseEbuth
 MSmits: it's just the servers they provide
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmmm
 MSmits: also, there is a maximum amount you can spend (quite high still)
 MSmits: i've seen PTW games where people spend 1000 a month to get ahead
 MSmits: this game is not like that
 MSmits: i can kinda understand having to pay for the official servers. You can't expect them to provide infinite calculation time after the initial price. I think that's what it is about mostly
 MSmits: normal games don't require much calculation per player, but coding games are different
 MSmits: anyways, that's what i get from the steam store page, havent played it myself
 struct: yeah it would be similar to cg charging like 5€ to month or something
 struct: for servers
 eulerscheZahl: ok, that sounds fair
 eulerscheZahl: it's just that i can't keep the pace to play everything on CG. and I play some other contests too. I matter of time
 eulerscheZahl: and it looked more like a heuristic game, which isn't exactly my cup of tea
 struct: yeah, its not a game I would enjoy
 struct: also I would need to use js
 eulerscheZahl: perfect summary of yare :D
 eulerscheZahl: one player managed to code in Rust with WASM
 eulerscheZahl: and shared a starter bot
 jacek: rust addicts :unamused:
 struct: I never used wasm tbh
 BlaiseEbuth: Addicts these days
 <b>**Chairmanfmao hello</b></p><p><img src="/a/70323045703940" /> Skynse: Rust do be addictive 
 Rag3ar0ck: resolve in python?
 MSmits: I prefer wasd to wasm. The m is too far away
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: :grin:
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: hard to make improvements Illedan?
 MSmits: hard to improve on nearly perfect
 struct: 7.0 points difference is not perfect
 MSmits: nearly
 struct: nah
 struct: im only 27 points behind
 struct: :p
 struct: What rank did you get on the fb copy Illedan?
 Illedan: Sogeti?
 Illedan: 3rd
 struct: yeah
 struct: nice
 struct: How well does your fb bot performs without spells?
 Illedan: Poor
 struct: &gt; top 10?
 Illedan: Didnt try
 Illedan: I can do a test
 struct: pb4 was top 10
 struct: before you submited your bot
 Illedan: :P
 struct: I mean his bot that uses no spells
 Illedan: I know
 struct: Might be worth a try just to get an idea
 Illedan: pushed
 struct: :thumbsup:
 Illedan: This version had 35 points with spells
 jacek: facebook?
 Dr_Monkey: fantastic its i think
 Dr_Monkey: bits
 jacek: tits?
 Illedan: Language!
 Dr_Monkey: exactly
 jacek: im using C++
 Dr_Monkey: i use python
 BlaiseEbuth: language!
 Dr_Monkey: bit late but ok
 BlaiseEbuth: Late? Its an answer to the message just before, so no.
 Illedan: 70 ish I guess struct
 Dr_Monkey: wdym
 struct: Maybe you can play with eval with this version
 struct: I think thats what pb4 did
 opitt: If you like a simple game, please approve mine - if you like it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7204a06363301568107e0e98085cfc40eb6a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7204a06363301568107e0e98085cfc40eb6a</a>
 MSmits: tbh
 MSmits: well... for lategames my hashing thingy drops solving time by around 30% in Yavalath
 MSmits: over unordered set that is
 jacek: jokes on you, lategames in yavalath are rarew
 MSmits: not when my bot plays them
 jacek: :smirk:
 MSmits: but yeah in general you're correct
 struct: you sovled 2 moves right?
 struct: solved*
 MSmits: Yeah, center 7. It's 2 moves when considering symmetry
 MSmits: it's really not hard, anyone can do it
 MSmits: center move is an hour or so, the ones around that a day or so if you have a reasonable algo
 MSmits: all the others seem unsolvable
 MSmits: which basically means there is no way to avoid going into the very late game where either player runs out of safe moves
 MSmits: you can see why that would be hard to solve
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: however, if you start with 3 2 for example, there are only 2 followups that aren't solved
 MSmits: and only 1 that is strong
 MSmits: a lot of these starting moves that arent solved have most of their replies solved
 MSmits: which turns a game with high branching into a manageable game
 struct: forced moves also help right?
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: yeah and trap moves
 MSmits: typically you have maybe 3-5 options to survive a trap
 MSmits: i should say, a trap that is coming. You either block the trap or play an available forced move
 MSmits: once the trap happens and you didn't prevent it, you've lost
 jacek: if you start playing game, you already lost
 MSmits: nooo, that is when the fun begins!
 MiyamuraIzumi: can a solver improve much on mcts of UTTT?
 MiyamuraIzumi: my solver seems quite dump, is this mean, I have done wrong?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know. for connect4 it didn't make much of a difference
 eulerscheZahl: Scambaiter got access to some cameras this time<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpzUjYYUp-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpzUjYYUp-Q</a>
 MiyamuraIzumi: yeah, I am trying to make thing
 struct: solver took me from 100
 struct: to top 50
 struct: on uttt
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am around 105, and solver make me to 160&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: so that must be my implement problem
 struct: probably
 MSmits: solver cant really hurt you if you do it right. It should only kick in on games that end in your expansion function
 MSmits: so otherwise it should not cause slowdown
 struct: unless is solver is very expensive
 struct: his*
 MSmits: yeah if you do it right, it should not be
 struct: i have no idea how mine performs tbh
 struct: its hard to test
 struct: you cant really test solver vs non solver
 struct: because you will end up using diferent paths
 MSmits: you can profile your solver. That gives you enough information
 MSmits: see how much&#160;% of total calc time it takes
 struct: True
 MSmits: it will likely be &lt; 2%
 struct: Not sure if I did that
 MSmits: &lt; 0.1% for early game
 MSmits: big question is whether to backprop solved games
 MSmits: i mean backprop the statistics
 MSmits: or only solve
 MSmits: if(ended) solve  else backprop
 struct: i do backprop
 MSmits: sometimes that seems bad
 struct: Never tested the other way
 MSmits: because you will also backprop paths noone would ever take
 MSmits: like a move thats insta loss in Y
 MSmits: might depend on the game
 struct: if you never took it you will never go into that node
 struct: because it was not expanded right?
 struct: Like if its a losing mvoe
 struct: on c4
 MSmits: well if your expansion function is really restrictive, the point is moot
 struct: moot?
 MSmits: there's no point
 MSmits: you already fixed the problem
 struct: ah
 jacek: hm? backprop solved when available
 MSmits: as win/loss stats jacek?
 MSmits: or just for the solver?
 jacek: backprop solved states as high as possible
 MSmits: thats not what i mean
 MSmits: do you both solve it and backprop it as win/visits
 MSmits: if(ended) solve  else backprop
 MSmits: or
 MSmits: if(ended) solve
 MSmits: backprop
 jacek: i just overwrite solved if thats what you mean
 MSmits: i just mean do you do both things, the solver function and the backprop function, on a solved expansion
 MSmits: or just the solver
 jacek: just solver 
 MSmits: ah ok, me too, mostly
 struct: maybe im the one doing it wrong 
 MSmits: not really, there's no rule that says either way is wrong
 MSmits: i can argue both ways
 MSmits: might depend on game
 MSmits: best thing is to try it
 MSmits: it's difficult for EPT though
 MSmits: if you backprop eval instead of win/loss stats
 MSmits: because what is the eval of a solved game?
 struct: 1
 struct: I see what you mean
 MSmits: really? What if a good game state for me has an eval of 10k
 struct: i normalize the game state
 MSmits: i don't 
 struct: my bt eval is always between [-1,1]
 MSmits: at least i don't think so, in most cases
 MSmits: extreme results average out mostly
 MSmits: i tried using tanh to get it in a fixed interval
 MSmits: wasn't better for onitama
 MSmits: slightly worse
 struct: I dont use tanh
 struct: I do some weird stuff
 MSmits: i also tried clamping
 struct: might not even be good
 MSmits: clamping was better than tanh actuallyu
 struct: like if there is a max of 16 pawns
 struct: its easy to normalize(?) it
 struct: current/16
 struct: then I apply score to it
 MSmits: yeah but your eval has many more parts
 struct: ofc
 struct: I do this for every part of it
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: still hard to compare it to a won or lost game
 struct: true
 Astrobytes: tanh worked for me in oware, can't remember if I still use it
 MSmits: oh it works fine, just when  I did a lot of testing it was a small winrate drop
 MSmits: who knows what that meant, could be RPS
 Astrobytes: I would guess so yeah
 MSmits: back then a small alteration to any param would change my winrate against a specific NN from 20% to 70% or vice versa
 struct: one day ill finish breakthrough eval
 Astrobytes: I really should rewrite that oware bot, it looks like a dogs breakfast
 struct: I wont touch oware
 struct: or yavalath
 MSmits: hah thats what i am doing with my Y bot, but I am not touching the sim. It's so complicated
 MSmits: I do weird stuff with pdep and pext
 Astrobytes: always fun looking back on those :D
 MSmits: at least I understand my oware bot
 MSmits: oh Astrobytes I did that hash table thingy, got 30% improvement on solving speed. For Y
 Astrobytes: Aha, see&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah i knew it worked from other games, but this bot is old, hadnt tried yet
 MSmits: well i tried it before, but not with the loop that looks for empty spot
 MSmits: marchete explained that part to me
 Astrobytes: I remember
 Astrobytes: Many ways to do it, stick with what works imo
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw, I have 40 million games now in my loca meta mcts tree for oware
 MSmits: not a single loop yet
 MSmits: they must be really long
 Astrobytes: wow, that's impressive tbh. Not 1 loop?!
 MSmits: nope, not in a selection phase I mean
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remember you explaining before
 MSmits: I go 50 deep in some places
 Astrobytes: When are you going to unleash the beast?
 MSmits: i keep increasing exploration param  too. It keeps hitting solved states
 Astrobytes: Intriguing
 MSmits: it's at 120 now. Based on seed gain
 MSmits: so a value can be +1 meaning expected net seed gain is 1
 MSmits: 120 is crazy high
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 MSmits: i unleashed the opening book from this on the leaderboard already, well a 30M version
 MSmits: it helps a bit, but it only goes to 36 seeds
 Astrobytes: Ah, I still haven't looked, other priorities atm
 MSmits: after that it needs a NN trained
 MSmits: and i havent done that yet
 MSmits: so it's really just an opening book
 Astrobytes: Yeah, quit procrastinating with Yavalath :P
 MSmits: not an option&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: anyway, off for some guitar. See ya later or tomorrow.
 MSmits: but it's cool to see games vs Robo that use moves from books like 30 plies deep until it's down to 36 seeds
 MSmits: bye Astrobytes
 struct: cya
 struct: your oware is with end game book right?
 struct: how many seeds?
 MSmits: yeah locally 36 seeds, in game 9 seeds
 MSmits: ingame includes turn limit, locally assumes no limit
 jacek: he may have slight chance with 48 seeds endgame
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: re ept, I have used sigmoid for normalization. It failed for onitama and did wonders for checkers
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i never had a good eval for checkers though
 MSmits: also hi darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: hi
 MSmits: did you get around to the whole nn thing yet?
 MSmits: not sure if you were going to
 jacek: oh my 3rd in checkers&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: no, I am reluctant to spend months before getting decent results. I love too much writing engines. For checkers, I picked the eval on Internet. You can already get something good by just valuing material
 MSmits: ahh, i guess i did that too, my rating is the same as yours
 jacek: i think material value will give you top30
 MSmits: I'm 8 with it
 MSmits: really fast sim though
 struct: scoring pawns on bt was top 20 I think
 MSmits: not sure how much that helps
 struct: the amount of pawns
 MSmits: I think i did like 100 score for men, 120 or 150 for kings
 MSmits: thats all
 darkhorse64: I have spent a lot of time on movegen
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: we probably ended up with something similar, like we did in c4
 struct: my movegen on bt is just a lot of while loops
 MSmits: most movegens of mine are that
 darkhorse64: It's a crazy bitboard thing. My eval is a bit more sophisticated but material is still hugely valued
 MSmits: yeah i have a crazy bb thing also
 MSmits: doing moves and jumps in parallel
 struct: on bt I dont think pawns are that important because you can have pawns that can be stuck for almost of the rest of the game
 darkhorse64: You use a skewed bitboard pattern&#160;?
 MSmits: i think so yeah
 jacek: huh
 jacek: welp i have simple bitboard, movegen speed isnt that crucial to me
 MSmits: struct yes material count is much less important in bt than in checkers
 MSmits: bt is very positional
 jacek: in bt, forward pawns are better, but protected forward pawns are betterer
 MSmits: like chess
 darkhorse64: We looked at the same things, then
 jacek: what the same thing?
 jacek: like that oware eval thing?
 jacek: but for checkers?
 MSmits: this is a piece of it darkhorse64
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b61e69ac-0d0a-404e-850b-ecfd00eb5c67">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b61e69ac-0d0a-404e-850b-ecfd00eb5c67</a>
 MSmits: it basically finds all jumps in one go and then does a while loop over the possible loops to create the children
 MSmits: possible jumps
 MSmits: makes more sense for moves i guess, since there usually arent that many possible jumps
 Kairu111: I have a problem with the Chuck Norris QuestMy code says that&#160;% in binary is 100101In the Chuck Norris job, the&#160;% binary is represented as 0100101
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cb18057-cca1-4540-82fc-045845ad6779">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cb18057-cca1-4540-82fc-045845ad6779</a>
 Kairu111: P.S Google translate
 struct: I do stuff like this for bt
 struct: Kairu111 its 7bit binary I think
 struct: You need padding zeros
 MSmits: oh, you make a move array!
 MSmits: I always immediately make children, skipping any intermediate array. Isn't that faster?
 struct: i get moves then create the children
 MSmits: yes, but the children come from the moves, so why not immediately get the move and make the child, without storing it
 struct: ah I see what you mean
 MSmits: without storing the move i mean
 struct: Never tried it
 MSmits: it might be a negligible difference
 darkhorse64: My implementation is completely different but the algo is the same. jacek: look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/checkerboard.php">http://www.fierz.ch/checkerboard.php</a> as a starting point
 MSmits: as long as you're not using vectors that are being resized and such
 struct: yeah
 struct: stockfish does it this way
 Kairu111: Can you tell me how to convert a 7-bit ASCII string to binary? thanks
 MSmits: then it's probably fine 
 struct: but they use minimax
 jacek: oh that guy finally used n-tuples for his checkers
 MSmits: nn also didnt he?
 jacek: no, just tuples + eval
 MSmits: oh it's his competitor then, that uses nn
 MSmits: it has some good information on creating endgame books also
 jacek: Kairu111 you need to add 0 at the left
 darkhorse64: Yep, that a thing I should do to speed up things for some old bots of mine
 darkhorse64: oops, scroll
 MSmits: yeah i was wondering what you were going to do with that extra 0
 Kairu111: jacekI don't really understand how this works, since when converting 'C' to binary, 0 is not appended to the left. And when I convert '%', it adds
 jacek: python?
 Kairu111: yes
 jacek: use .zfill(7)
 Kairu111: Thank you
 MSmits: thanks *python knowledge increased*
 darkhorse64: for checkers bitboarding, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.3dkingdoms.com/checkers/bitboards.htm">https://www.3dkingdoms.com/checkers/bitboards.htm</a> 
 MSmits: seems different from what i did. This uses a little bit more ops, but i am guessing cheaper ones, because I use pext
 jacek: i have very basic 'bitboard'. 64bits for 1 player. actually it doesnt differ much from 2d array approach, except i use long instead of the array
 darkhorse64: I use 32 bits and no pext
 darkhorse64: 32 bits for pawns and kings, so it's actually 64 bit for one player
 MSmits: yeah same
 MSmits: mmh for yavalath, is it ever worth it to play on a hex that can't contribute to a win and can't be played on by opponent?
 MSmits: except when there are no other options
 MSmits: seems like a way to speed up solving if this is a correct rule
 jacek: maybe it will pay off in endgame if opponent doesnt have free hex
 MSmits: yeah but thats why i said, cant be played on by opponent
 MSmits: so its already a losing hex for him
 MSmits: i cant win on it and he cant play on it
 jacek: youre the most qualified person to answer that&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, I was just wondering  if i am missing something
 MSmits: noone else shares my obsession&#160;:(
 MSmits: I guess you all have different ones. 
 Dr_Monkey: anyone wanna look at my clash of code idea
 darkhorse64: Using domain knowledge to have a sort of quiescence search during expansion or rollout is very rewarding. Combined with a solver, it rocks. I remember solving completely a C4 position at move 48 in less than 800 searches
 struct: i do a sort of quiescence search during rollout on bt
 MSmits: mmh how do you do a quiescence search on c4?
 MSmits: i mean i keep expanding if there is only 1 possible move
 MSmits: that's sort of similar i guess&#160;?
 struct: I would say so
 struct: I dont think I do it in my current submit
 struct: I kinda lost track of versions
 MSmits: it's pretty easy to implement. Just put a while loop in for when you expand. While (selected-&gt;childcount == 1) etc.
 MSmits: break on solved nodes 
 struct: yeah I have it implemented
 darkhorse64: Yes, that's what I meant
 struct: just not on this versions
 MSmits: ahh ok darkhorse64, i just never thought of it as quiescence. That's usually mentioned in the context of minimax type searches
 MSmits: but yeah i see the parallel
 struct: my qs on bt rollout is like add 2 more depth
 struct: if a pawn is capruted
 struct:  :d
 struct: or if there is a forced move
 MSmits: 2?
 struct: i increase max depth sorry
 struct: Yeah 2 more turns will be played
 struct: Dont know why I put 2
 struct: It might even not do much at all
 MSmits: for checkers it's worth it for sure
 MSmits: bt prolly also
 MSmits: because capturing isn't that helpful if you get captured right back
 darkhorse64: I tried the same on checkers but it failed. It may be me
 MSmits: it is a basic feature for checkers minimax
 MSmits: but dont know how well it would work for mcts
 darkhorse64: With C4, it works
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/abcbed0f-e26f-433c-83cb-9801648eb015">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/abcbed0f-e26f-433c-83cb-9801648eb015</a>
 MSmits: just coded this for y
 MSmits: the quiescence thingy
 MSmits: should be good for series of forced moves
 darkhorse64: Yes, I should revisit this bot. I have learned a lot since then
 MSmits: yeah that's what I am doing
 MSmits: sometimes it takes people beating you to do that&#160;:)

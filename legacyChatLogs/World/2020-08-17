 scofield2: Let's DO THIS
 scofield2: :worried:
 MSmits: morning
 Marchete: moin
 MSmits: in the train back to work now, arriving in 5 minutes
 MSmits: no teaching yet, first class on thursday
 Marchete: to prepare classes?
 MSmits: among other things yeah
 MSmits: schools are fully open when the amount of infections is just as bad as when they first closed.... it's weird
 Marchete: here is against bad
 Marchete: but we are testing much much more
 Marchete: so it's not exactly the same
 MSmits: it's not, no
 Marchete: I fear to send my kid to school in Sept...
 MSmits: mostly fear for yourself, kid is probably more in danger of crossing the road every day to school
 MSmits: but they infect older people
 MSmits: people underestimate the amount of damage this virus can do to a 30-40 year old
 MSmits: even if it doesn't kill them
 Marchete: ..or not
 MSmits: thats why statistics say anyway
 Marchete: people understimate long term effects on an unknown virus
 MSmits: what
 MSmits: Marchete yeah
 MSmits: I feel our government has just decided to experiment with the health and lives of me and my colleagues by dropping us in a building with 1100 students
 MSmits: a building originally meant for 600-700
 Marchete: for science!
 MSmits: maybe it will go ok, maybe not, it's still an experiment
 Marchete: that's crazy
 MSmits: right :P
 Marchete: here we are trying to reduce to 50%
 MSmits: not here, fully opening
 MSmits: only rule is that they have to keep 1.5m distance from me
 MSmits: and I can use a mask if I want to
 Marchete: if you want?
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: here we are pretty much mandatory
 Marchete: they are trying to ban smoking in open ares if you are near others
 Marchete: they*
 MSmits: why smoking?
 MSmits: does corona travel on smoke particles?
 Marchete: smoke = no mask and air expelled with more force
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: smoking is not allowed in or near our school
 MSmits: so that at least is no problem
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: but no masks is really weird
 Frosty8529: I am bad at programming and life
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: ok gtg, I'll be back tonight
 MSmits: ttyl
 Frosty8529:&#160;:(
 MSmits: sorry Frosty8529 gtg
 Marchete: take care
 chinaredclif: good morning
 jebreen: sartan55
 SaHav: wow
 zlatanised: heyya
 FinnWerner: ki+
 FinnWerner: hey
 jacek: good morning
 AntiSquid: hi
 Hogachaka: hello world
 BbgHina: hi everyone
 Thyl: good morning&#160;!
 Psychora: Hello
 MyoThuraWin: may br
 MyoThuraWin: hello from hello world
 sebounet: hey
 DiL: hello everyone
 DomiKo: Hiiii
 AggYzz: helo peoples
 devjayantmalik: why mathematicians made -1 greater than -4 on number line&#160;?
 jrke: because -1 lies on right side of -4 on number line and right means greater
 devjayantmalik: Thanks everyone
 Shyroe: a
 jacek: woooo new puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: hi dbdr your chat history script seems to be broken
 dbdr: yeah, got a "Resource temporarily unavailable"
 MSmits: hi
 MSmits: got my meta mcts working last night for SameGame. I had it running with a single mcts turn of 1 minute
 MSmits: got crap scores.  I think I need to do 3 seconds per turn and then do a full mcts game
 MSmits: papers confirmed this, seems like it is better to spread the mcts time over several turns instead of building the tree on turn 1
 Westicles: euler, what happened to your submission for test1?
 xlr4829: HELLO 
 MSmits: hi capsguy
 jacek: WHAT IF IT WAS SHIFT
 MSmits: i meant he's typing in  all caps, not that he used capslock :P
 MSmits: it could be shift, indeed
 DomiKo: I'm trying to catch you guys ;P
 dbdr: nice progress DomiKo!
 DomiKo: :grin:
 xlr4829: 'abc'.split(<i>).map(char=&gt;char.charCodeAt()).reduce((a,b)=&gt;a+b,0) ==&gt;</i>
 MSmits: GJ
 xlr4829:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I meant DomiKo, but good job to you to xlr4829
 MSmits: too
 dbdr: random_guy&gt; it doesn't make sense to compare [A] with [B], because they're not the samedbdr&gt; Why would you compare things that are the same?
 MSmits: why would you compare things that are different?
 JBM: random_guy&gt; the same nature, you pedantic moron
 MSmits: why do any of us compare things?
 dbdr: dbdr&gt; A comparison is precisely between things that are not the same, to identify both similitudes and differences.
 JBM: i compare things that are the same all the time
 JBM: that's how i decide to break my otherwise infinite loops
 MSmits: yeah it gives true
 dbdr: JBM, there were of the same nature
 dbdr: *they
 dbdr: JBM: so you are even more extreme than me&#160;:)
 MSmits: mmh so basically I should find out if two things are the same before I compare them, otherwise there is no point?
 MSmits: :confused:
 JBM: on some axes, most probably yea
 dbdr: my point is rather that comparisons are fine
 MSmits: I agree
 MSmits: they're awesome
 JBM: i love them
 MSmits: good point dbdr
 dbdr: I'm annoyed by this argument, it's illogical
 MSmits: those are the best arguments
 dbdr: it's just an easy way out of a comparison when you don't like the conclusion
 MSmits: barely an inconvenience
 MSmits: easy ways are tight
 dbdr: wat? :D
 MSmits: you dont get the reference?
 dbdr: nope
 MSmits: finally someone else besides me misses a reference
 MSmits: sec let me link it
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: damn slow wifi, just search youtube for "pitch meeting" 
 MSmits: there's hundreds and they are great
 dbdr: outsourcing search&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: they pick a movie and imagine what the pitch meeting would have been like
 MSmits: during which they slam the movie hard
 dbdr: nice idea
 MSmits: the reference were standard phrases, used in every instance
 MSmits: you'll notice if you watch one
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRqsC4UuY_A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRqsC4UuY_A</a>
 MSmits: thats the one for avengers end game
 dbdr: I don't watch that much hollywood I think. but I did see Independence day ages ago, watching that one&#160;:)
 dbdr: it's good
 MSmits: yeah, i watch a lot of movies, so i can pretty much pick any one of them
 MSmits: perks of working 4 days a week :P
 MSmits: allright train arriving, ttyl
 dbdr: hollywood is a strict subset of movies&#160;;)
 dbdr: got the "barely an inconvenience"&#160;:)
 kovi: nice score domiko. still online?
 DomiKo: nahhh
 DomiKo: with online i reached 110k
 kovi: that is still very good
 DomiKo: I got lucky in some cases
 DomiKo: with offline I barely beat them
 jrke: which could be best algo for samegame to learn
 DomiKo: from papers i guess the NRPA 
 DomiKo: but MCTS is good too
 DomiKo: you can try some MC like me
 DomiKo: MC + simple heuristic
 DomiKo: can give you really nice score
 kovi: you can add SA to MC
 DomiKo: 140K+ 
 ondron: Hello, does anyone know if thrust/boost influences the turning speed? and how fast can it turn? Sorry if I should not ask here, I am new here.
 ondron: Coders strike back
 ondron: forgot that
 DomiKo: maximum 18 degrees
 ondron: thanks:&gt;
 DomiKo: and thrust/boost does't affect it
 DomiKo: its always 18
 ondron: so if angle of the point where the pod is going is 180° from where it is currently facing, it is going to turn at 18°/sec.Is the turning speed linear to the angle/10 of the point it is going to?
 DomiKo: "The pod will pivot to face the destination point by a maximum of 18 degrees per turn and will then accelerate in that direction."
 ondron: ok thanks:), I think it turns at 18 degrees/sec unless it needs to turn less than 18 degrees.
 DomiKo: yes
 ondron: I appreciate your help:)
 DomiKo: no problem&#160;;)
 Shyroe: sd
 cegprakash: suddenly a wild ceg appears
 MSmits: kill it! It gives 20 xp!
 MSmits: and pristine hides!
 reCurse: I've already done my dailies
 jacek: so i wrote an article on jacekmax
 reCurse: No.
 jacek: yes
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct-draft">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct-draft</a>
 reCurse: Ok at least it's called properly :p
 jacek: everything my idea is already written about&#160;:(
 reCurse: Welcome to life
 MSmits: sounds like you found a draft formula for locam :P
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: using uct for draft :P
 jacek: so im not original?&#160;:(
 MSmits: ahh nvm, if you didnt do locam you have no idea what I am talking about&#160;:)
 MSmits: bad reference
 jacek: i know what locam is
 MSmits: ok so you know I tried to find a draft formula using something like 30-40 parameters
 MSmits: was just sayin your link looks like you cracked it
 jacek: draft?
 jacek: by draft i mean its ufinished
 MSmits: i got that
 MSmits: it's a poor joke lol, dont make me keep explaining it :P
 jacek: i feel dumb&#160;:(
 reCurse: Even calling that a joke is an offense to all dad jokes
 MSmits: thanks reCurse
 MSmits: I missed you
 reCurse: Depending on your perspective it's either a compliment or an insult
 reCurse: I'll leave the interpretation up to the reader
 jacek: with every bullet*
 inoryy: hi missed you, I'm inoryy
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 jacek: :expressionless:
 AntiSquid: :spam_emote:
 JBM: wrriting some more cglambda if anyone's bored <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm">https://www.twitch.tv/cg_jbm</a>
 jacek: lambda?
 jacek: it has so many meanings
 darkhorse64: jacek: I just read your draft. Really nice from you to share your secret weaponry. Regarding your scoring for win/lose, I believe you can achieve the same result with a MCTS Solver where you record the depth at which the game is solved, thereby avoiding to mix eval/result in the backpropagation phase. It is likely it does not change anything but provides a cleaner implementation
 jacek: darkhorse64 the solver is implied  in the score. if abs(score) &gt; 1 then it is solved (though i also have boolean solved in node for draws). the score depth is merely to choose fastest win or slowest lose
 jacek: i backpropagate so the parent's score is -max children's score. if one child is win, then is lose for parent. if all children are lose then parent is win.
 darkhorse64: This is well explained in your draft. My point was that it may be better implementation wise to have an explicit solver (which will handle nicely draws).
 darkhorse64: I agree it's a very small detail
 jacek: so its just implementation detail. just like if you use -1, 0 1 or 0, 0.5, 1
 wlesavo: i think i missed smth, did  eulerscheZahl fooled us with his high score on testcase1 and just gave us xss ejected link damn you euler
 jacek: lets see what Automaton2000 thinks about him
 Automaton2000: must be a reason for that
 eulerscheZahl: no, that score was on the website for real
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i've sent an email to the admins to fix their website :P
 wlesavo: lol
 wlesavo: still funny though, i waited your updated score for quite a long time
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 jacek: Automaton2000 really?
 Automaton2000: msmits did you try to submit my code in the referee
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: crap he found me out
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl you really should have gone for security specialist :P
 MSmits: you're always doing this stuff
 eulerscheZahl: i was surprised i fooled you and no one caught suspicion :D
 MSmits: fooled me, even though not that long before you were discussing the security of the site...
 eulerscheZahl: but honestly: that page is almost 20 years old. you can do stuff there that shouldn't work on a modern website
 MSmits: makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: and dbdr incited me to share a top score
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yay i got an small improvement on testcase 2
 MSmits: was trying a new UCT formula and tuning the parameters with a 1s turn timer got lucky
 Illedan: Damn, fooled me too eulerscheZahl. Was waiting too. Even checked a few times to see if you submitted yet -.-I should learn..
 eulerscheZahl: i definitely got a higher score within 4 days than everyone else trying for months :smirk:
 jacek: nyoro~n
 Illedan: Take it as a compliment :P 
 eulerscheZahl: i do. and now i'll go to sleep. good night
 Illedan: gn
 Illedan: I'll go fix my nginx
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: fix it with apache? :P
 Illedan: hm?
 eulerscheZahl: just trolling, i'm fine with nginx
 Illedan: I'm just very bad at nginx
 Illedan: Can't get it to push my html file public -.-
 Illedan: Guess I broke something alone the wY
 reCurse: Should be pretty easy
 dbdr: oh, yeah, now it's my fault euler? :P
 Westicles: eulerscheZahl is now a wanted man in germany
 dbdr: I told him he would be fine, he can get internet and even play soccer in jail
 jacek: with pencil and paper
 DomiKo: ehhhhh
 DomiKo: 146K
 DomiKo: so close and so far
 BenFreanklin: COol
 BenFreanklin: What rank do you guys suggest
 [4G]: LVL 3 :nerd:
 JBM: gg
 jrke: when i was 10 i play dots and boxes with my friends and now in bot programming&#160;;) 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and your friends are still butthurt.&#160;;) :P
 jrke: :smiley:
 markyy: how does clash of codes ranking work?

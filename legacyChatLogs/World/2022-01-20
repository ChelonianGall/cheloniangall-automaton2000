 5DN1L: somehow they don't care about copyrights of community-made puzzles

 Quidome: hm, let's decrypt that one :D

 5DN1L: Azar_Ibrahimli Are you having a problem with any specific puzzle right now?
 SMOKEz8z8: Hi, question about the easy puzzle, 'Defibrillators'. test 1, 3 and 4 work. But test 2 fails. I noticed in the input there are alot more decimal place on the degree.  I limited those but still no cigar. Cant see a clue in the explenation.
 SMOKEz8z8: also, the codes looks horrible, the I put the whole formula on one line. Is that bad practise?
 SMOKEz8z8: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f5948a2-0bbb-4b84-9cc4-d96e1171fcb1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f5948a2-0bbb-4b84-9cc4-d96e1171fcb1</a>
 5DN1L: sorry
 5DN1L: pastebin out of service
 5DN1L: you need to use an outside pastebin website
 SMOKEz8z8: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/gU3s0Hka">https://pastebin.com/gU3s0Hka</a>
 5DN1L: wow you're trying very hard to do everything in one line o_O
 SMOKEz8z8: hehehe
 SMOKEz8z8: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/defibrillators">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/defibrillators</a> it is that formula
 SMOKEz8z8: the formula works, since test 1, 3 and 4 work... but I dont know why test 2 'exact location' fails
 5DN1L: Well I'd rather do it over several lines :stuck_out_tongue:
 5DN1L: but anyway, did you try to do the calculations using Excel or a calculator to verify what you've calculated using python?
 SMOKEz8z8: I'll check
 SMOKEz8z8: I'll first make the code more readable
 5DN1L: yup, and try to come up with ways to debug, like what i suggested
 5DN1L: also note that there is a function in the math module to convert between radians and degrees
 5DN1L: i mean two functions, one function for each direction
 SMOKEz8z8: I'll look it up. for this puzzle needed to do a lot of googeling, never used longitude and lattitude so wanted to understand how it even works
 5DN1L: yeah sure
 ThisCodegDeverloper: hi guys i am very new to languages ​​like c# c++ will this page help me?
 5DN1L: if very new, maybe not. you need to learn the basics first
 5DN1L: after you've learned the basics, you can come back to practise here
 ThisCodegDeverloper: C# basic level course
 ThisCodegDeverloper: But here I am, all of a sudden, I'm confused, I can't figure it out
 SMOKEz8z8: I'm very new, if you know how to write statements, etc. you can use the easy puzzels and google to learn more
 SMOKEz8z8: hardest part at first for me was, understanding the input they give you, how to take that in so you can use it in your statements
 ThisCodegDeverloper: I've used it many times, I'm sorry
 5DN1L: What do you mean by "it"?
 SMOKEz8z8: ok solved it, on the second testcase, the distance was 0.
 SMOKEz8z8: was just gonna ask how to properly set a value to something which you dont know the value of
 SMOKEz8z8: for now I flipped it around instead of saying d=0 I guessed a distance that would always be bigger.. 10000000.00 but that is a gable
 SMOKEz8z8: gamble
 SMOKEz8z8: thx for the tip Uljahn
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 5DN1L: :thumbsup: Uljahn
 5DN1L: I continue to have my lunch in peace
 SMOKEz8z8: yep that works perfect, without having to guess a maximum or minimum version
 SMOKEz8z8: ow snap now I wont pass a validation&#160;:)
 Uljahn: your distance values differ from mine, so there might be a mistake in your formula
 SMOKEz8z8: thx for the pointer
 SMOKEz8z8: Uljahn are you using the supplied formula?
 SMOKEz8z8: only thing I can find is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula</a>
 SMOKEz8z8: use an other formula to avoid problems at small values
 Uljahn: im using formulae supplied in the statement
 SMOKEz8z8: k thx, got it working now, instead of trying to figure out (with my bad math skillz) how to convert the formula on the wiki to python&#160;:)
 SMOKEz8z8: seem the part of the cos, needs ( ) around the top line.
 Cederkaeppen: Finally made it bros... top 100 in clash of code

 SMOKEz8z8: I had the same thing, had to reload the page
 Melting_Ice: i did
 5DN1L: I've just tried my code, the animation runs fine
 SMOKEz8z8: can always try ctrl f5 to fully reload, but I would copy my code just to be sure it wont get 'forgotten'
 Melting_Ice: well it doesn't run for me

 Archopecia: Now he is PMing me :rolling_eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: In fact he added words...
 5DN1L: I don't have to google it if he's referring to some triad gang stuff. But I mean, do you invite members to a triad gang in the OPEN?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: we are reaching levels of braindeadness that shouldn't be possible
 Automaton2000: i think my bot is even worse
 5DN1L: that's why i feel it so surreal
 BlaiseEbuth: Triad gang?
 5DN1L: organised crime group
 Archopecia: KKK is the klu klux klan. The primarily american ones in white hoods that want to kill black people (and have in the past). They are trolling to try and get a reaction.
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah I know 5DN1L, just don't see the link with KKK
 5DN1L: i think they're similar?
 Archopecia: No not really
 Archopecia: Triads are organized crime, KKK is a hate group
 5DN1L: ah i see
 Archopecia: Triads are more equivalent to Hell's Angels in North America
 5DN1L: Archopecia If needed, keep some screenshots of your PMs with that guy and send it to Thibaud as evidence of harassment

 5DN1L: Brody_The_Vegan You started learning Ruby yesterday, so you've still got more to learn and practise
 SMOKEz8z8: how can the code breaker puzzle be called easy? I have no clue how to tackle the multiply part...google just get me heavy stuff like Euclidean algorithms.Am I on the right track?
 5DN1L: just brute-force
 5DN1L: don't over-think it
 SMOKEz8z8: yeah the first part brute force was easy enough (although I was going for an over thinking solution first)
 SMOKEz8z8: but the multiply part...
 SMOKEz8z8: i ll try some more&#160;:)
 5DN1L: convert single loop to nested loop
 5DN1L: then you can brute-force both
 SMOKEz8z8: on that note, if you add or remove a loop. is there an easy way to indend or de indend multiple lines?
 5DN1L: tab / shirt-tab
 5DN1L: highlight the relevant lines first, of course
 5DN1L: shift-tab
 5DN1L: oops
 SMOKEz8z8: ah the highlighting is the trick
 SMOKEz8z8: thanks
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 SMOKEz8z8: was doing it line for line
 SMOKEz8z8: i think the&#160;% thing is trowing me off.. back to google.
 5DN1L: ok, i'll let you discover for yourself :D
 5DN1L: it's nothing complex really
 SMOKEz8z8: grrr that makes me more mad&#160;:)
 SMOKEz8z8: i tried a nested loop with range 1 to 100 as a brute for on top of the alphabet len one
 SMOKEz8z8: but it just starts returning the same line after a certain point
 SMOKEz8z8: (well I dont like it when I need to think hard over something simple. if it is complex sure, hurt my brain. ) 
 5DN1L: try think of toy examples then
 5DN1L: start with 2, 3, 4, 5...
 5DN1L: you'll know you don't have to test millions of numbers
 5DN1L: (2,3,4,5 refer to length of alphabet)
 SMOKEz8z8: thx think that's a good tip, took some pen and paper and noticed a pattern.say letter is 4, shift is 8, we get twelve. multi say, 3, we get. 36. %whatever.for each answer with the same modulo. it goes up with the value of the multi...
 foxforfoxes: helloooo
 foxforfoxes: me again
 foxforfoxes: i figured out python
 Wontonimo: +99 (not +100 because I'm not feeling that generous today)
 foxforfoxes: python 3 tho
 Wontonimo: why would you use any other version?
 SMOKEz8z8: hehe, yeah well, I might be on to your puzzle, but solving it is still not working
 foxforfoxes: idk
 foxforfoxes: is there any way to just free code?
 foxforfoxes: without solveing puzzles
 5DN1L: you can come up of projects of your own
 foxforfoxes: how?
 5DN1L: by thinking?
 foxforfoxes: no like what do you have to do
 foxforfoxes: like what do you go to
 5DN1L: SMOKEz8z8 Let's ignore multiply for now. Say the length of the alphabet is 5, how many numbers do you test for "shift"?
 SMOKEz8z8: 5
 5DN1L: OK
 SMOKEz8z8: len(alphabet)
 5DN1L: For multiply, you just test the same
 5DN1L: you don't have to test more
 SMOKEz8z8: well, i made extra loop around the code that works on the len(alphabet). for b in range(100): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/390f94cc-70f7-404f-b544-cf6c9dde6cee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/390f94cc-70f7-404f-b544-cf6c9dde6cee</a>
 SMOKEz8z8: lol pastbin of my chat
 5DN1L: why is it 100?
 SMOKEz8z8: the multiply can be any number, is not limited to the alphabet?
 5DN1L: Read the puzzle statement
 5DN1L: Constraint
 5DN1L: The shift and multiply are both less than or equal to the length of the alphabet
 SMOKEz8z8: ok... did not read that
 SMOKEz8z8: len(alphabet) it is I guess&#160;:)
 5DN1L: :wink: Yes
 Eclipse_Storm: I might be missing something but in the "Counting TicTacToe" puzzle it usually happens that I win, then get a timeout and I'm set as the loser... why does it happen? :S
 Wontonimo: don't time out.  timing out means your program didn't operate within the hard constraints, and is automatically disqualified.  
 Eclipse_Storm: Okay forget my question, I missed the part where we played 2 rounds and had an error in my code&#160;;)
 jacek: oh so they fixed that in statement eh
 struct: is the game still a draw?
 struct: or did any rule change?
 gumark: help
 gumark: dis is hard
 jacek: dats what she said
 jacek: struct still a draw
 jacek: and some crash apparently
 struct: oh well I keep playing bt then
 struct: Cant draw on that one
 jacek: any breakthrough lately?
 SMOKEz8z8: nope.. still not solved, (if you are even asking me)
 struct: nope 
 struct: still working on my gui
 SMOKEz8z8: thx for all the tips 5DN1L , but... still think I need to inverse the modulo, or something.
 SMOKEz8z8: tried every way I could think of of adding an extra loop of len(alphabet)
 SMOKEz8z8: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/84d8f9ad-bcea-4187-80e3-07933d754536">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/84d8f9ad-bcea-4187-80e3-07933d754536</a>
 5DN1L: Did you search python operators for "%"?
 SMOKEz8z8: i found pow(x, y, z) where pow(x, -1, len(alphabet) is the thing i need I think
 5DN1L: No, did you search python operators for "%"? 
 SMOKEz8z8: ill google that exact string :D
 Idk.-_-: const n = readline();const t = readline();const r = new RegExp(n+'+','g');console.log(t.replace(r,x=&gt;x.length));
 Idk.-_-: can somone write this code on python&#160;? pls
 5DN1L: Yes, I'm sure someone can.
 jacek: exec("const n = readline();const t = readline();const r = new RegExp(n+'+','g');console.log(t.replace(r,x=&gt;x.length));")
 Idk.-_-: 5dn1l you cant&#160;?
 jacek: Automaton2000 can?
 Automaton2000: i don't have a good scoring function
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 solve the puzzles for me
 Automaton2000: i need to play a bit with a large fishbot
 5DN1L: wow. don't slap me with that
 5DN1L: i won't ask you again
 SMOKEz8z8: 5DN1L , just to be sure, google only have my info about the&#160;% operator, and did not give operators for the&#160;%...
 5DN1L: just google "python operators" and you'll see&#160;% as one of them
 5DN1L: in fact, why not take the chance to read about ALL of them
 5DN1L: instead of just ONE of them?
 SMOKEz8z8: I did, I did... although the whole list is a bit long&#160;:)
 5DN1L: and the point is: you don't have to overthink, you don't have to reinvent the wheel :wink:
 5DN1L: you can convert the formula in the puzzle statement to your code in a rather straight forward way
 SMOKEz8z8: at this point I'm just using a shotgun methode of trowing all kinds of crap at the problem and seeing what comes out...
 5DN1L: what you had is good enough
 5DN1L: maybe you just have to modify the line "test += ..."
 SMOKEz8z8: think it is time to cut my loss..converting the formula,x+a is just i from one of the loops, the *B is /B, the %L is *(len(alphabet)
 5DN1L: @_@
 SMOKEz8z8: ow man... this just hurts... thx for you patience&#160;:)
 5DN1L: are you still trying to convert it to another formula?
 SMOKEz8z8: i been do ing what not with that line
 SMOKEz8z8: ((X+A)*B)%L is the formula, trying to reverse it
 5DN1L: you don't have to
 5DN1L: brute-force means you just try to plug in the numbers
 5DN1L: and see if they fit
 5DN1L: no inversion
 5DN1L: or reversal
 5DN1L: hmmmm
 SMOKEz8z8: ok, the basic, shift was easy to brute force. then just shift that one again brute force?? but that did not work.. or do I need to multiply to bruteforce values?
 5DN1L: i think i may start to understand why you're doing that way
 5DN1L: you try to decode
 5DN1L: but i try to encode :smirk:
 5DN1L: hint hint
 SMOKEz8z8: you should have seen my first try lol, trying to find a pattern in the distance of the letters, to use that to find the same pattern in the message... kinda worked
 SMOKEz8z8: ok... wait, let say I brute for tests first char. then the second char doesnt use the same code.. i just a random other char.
 5DN1L: sorry i was multi-tasking so didn't think over your code deeply :stuck_out_tongue:
 SMOKEz8z8: i just make a random string containing all options in the alphabet
 5DN1L: why not encode the word itself?
 5DN1L: and see if the encoded word appears in the full encoded sentence?
 SMOKEz8z8: yeah
 SMOKEz8z8: but that would give alot of false positive
 SMOKEz8z8: ah cool
 SMOKEz8z8: ok ill try that
 SMOKEz8z8: but then I would need to decode again&#160;:) lol
 5DN1L: well you still have to check after you've got a match
 5DN1L: because as you say there can be false positives
 5DN1L: erm... you still don't have to decode
 5DN1L: i mean
 SMOKEz8z8:&#160;? but if I encode the word, see if that is in the message, I then need to use that setttings I used to encoded the word. to decode the message?
 5DN1L: you have to, but you don't have to reverse the formula to decode
 5DN1L: you can decode without coming up with a reversed formula first
 SMOKEz8z8: instead of bruteforce decoding, and seeing if the word is in the message, I go and brute for encode, and see if the result is in the encrypted message
 SMOKEz8z8:&#160;?
 5DN1L: yes, that's step 1
 5DN1L: step 2 is to check whether it's a false positive
 5DN1L: if not, go to step 3, decode the entire message
 SMOKEz8z8: so reverse the steps, and see if the word is now in the reversed message?
 5DN1L: i'll PM you so as not to flood this chat lol

 Blabbage: just wrote some suggestions
 Blabbage: I like the idea, just think it is a bit inconsistent and language specific
 Blabbage: I put it as a comment under the contribution
 Blabbage: as well
 Blokops: totally forgot about float. And yes you are right is to python specific.
 Blabbage:&#160;:) WIP
 Blabbage: Often times things are very clear when you write them, and then not so clear when others take a look&#160;:) Same for me too:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/8002ea73cdd5181a43df0d92f716b186209e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/8002ea73cdd5181a43df0d92f716b186209e</a>
 Blokops: a quick thing i saw on yours is that reversed wont work since you dont know if you have to round up or down
 Blabbage: You do not round up or down, you round to one decimal

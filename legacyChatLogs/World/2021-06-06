 GarethEddies: I wonder why people don't share their core more readily
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Because CoC code is usually sloppy

 PatrickMcGinnisII: php
 ANONYMOUS42: thinking php but averttostring doesn't show up on google
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh, function to change verts to string
 PatrickMcGinnisII: array of verts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: blame euler
 PatrickMcGinnisII: solving Sokoban
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's an endstate mapper
 ANONYMOUS42: oh so it's your function
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII nods</b></p><p><img src="/a/12323424608735" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: i thought he wanted code, rofl ... so i just finished writing it...nutz huh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only gets run once
 ANONYMOUS42: why? do the CG servers go down after running it??!
 ANONYMOUS42: you must be hacker
 PatrickMcGinnisII: funny.  Sokoban puzzle is just a b*tch
 PatrickMcGinnisII: searchtree requires a hashtable to prevent infinite loops
 PatrickMcGinnisII: driving me insane
 ANONYMOUS42: i had to do a similar puzzle to it on my second year in CS uni
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so instead of a bunch of compares at eacj node to determine if search is done i just compute the valid final states, pretty standard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but it looks really funky
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 ANONYMOUS42: the difference was there was no blocks to move and whenever the player moved they had to go all the way until they hit a wall
 ANONYMOUS42: oh i see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler has a few puzzles that have a degree of insanity built in

 StevensGino: I have tried to use GA for Mars Lander, but end up using Heuristic
 StevensGino:&#160;:(
 jacek: try heuristic GA [solved]
 LazyMammal: FrancoRoura connect-4 in Python, yes.With bitboard minimax depth 3 is possible.For depth 4 you need alpha-beta pruning.
 LazyMammal: I'm just using wins/losses so far.
 LazyMammal: If depth reached or board full (haha) then I return tie.
 jacek: and bitboard in python? w00t
 Uljahn: bitboards in numpy are quite effective
 kovi: hmm, it seems that connect4 top5-12 is pretty much the same
 kovi: jacek you have nn? (vs. msmits books)
 jacek: no. one of them is rust&#160;:/
 jacek: self-trained nn. i dont train nn against specific opponents
 kovi: sorry i meant that
 kovi: just combined msmits in the same sentence
 jacek: ah
 LazyMammal: For me bitboard = built-in int.  Python has arbitrary integers so I don't have to write my own.
 LazyMammal: I use two integers as bitplanes.  One for each player.  Pretty fast.  I wouldn't expect minimax to work very well if my board was a bit list&#160;:(
 jacek: connect4 over doubled players this week
 LazyMammal: It's nice to see the "Puzzle of the Week" actually draws people over
 StevensGino: connect 4 already have 241 players
 StevensGino: great
 jrke: its becomming next D&amp;B
 StevensGino: yes
 jacek: or othello, or yinsh...
 jrke: volcanoes can also gain lot of players easy to start tough to master
 StevensGino: :relaxed:
 kovi: but none is as fun as dice duel 3d
 jacek: but you need gpu for that ~
 IgnacyJ: who doesnt have gpu???
 jacek: decent* gpu
 Ano.code[Love]: hello
 emh: woow.. there are so many new multis that I haven't done
 Chainman: heeeyyy
 Chainman: how many?
 Chainman: I'm new to this site I wouldn't know
 emh: 29
 emh: 29 new and 33 I've done
 emh: I'm more motivated by the ones with leagues and bosses tho
 geppoz: question: in MCTS, it make sense to do many rollouts in a single step to have a better evaluation?
 geppoz: from the same state I mean
 darkhorse64: less nodes explored but more accurate information on a node, that's a trade off
 geppoz: and in this case, the n denominator counter for the UCB should be incremented by the numbers of rollouts, or by 1 in any case?
 geppoz: I suppose if you score as the avg of rollouts, by 1, if you score as the sum of rollouts, then n
 geppoz: but which is the correct one to keep balance score with other nodes?
 darkhorse64: 1 rollout = 1 visit. If you do more rollouts, the UCT formula will take care of selecting the "interesting" nodes
 MSmits: well you can also count 2 rollouts as 1 visit because you will just refit the exploration parameter
 MSmits: exploration would have to be twice as big
 MSmits: there's many ways to do these things
 MSmits: I never get a lot of difference in bot performance from tweaking these things
 MSmits: just as long as the values arent ridiculous
 MSmits: (parameters)
 MSmits: what is very important is a good eval, in case you're terminating  the rollout early and evaluate. In that case parameters are very important
 geppoz: I'm trying in connect4, so always to the end
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: btw, darkhorse and I usually just do a random playout from each child and backpropagate the total result
 MSmits: though it doesnt always make a big difference for me, it's convenient
 geppoz: but I mean, if I do 10 rollouts from a new expanded state, and I get a score of 7 (1=win -1=loss), I should backpropagate w=7 and n=10&#160;?
 geppoz: or w=0.7 and n=1
 darkhorse64: 7/10
 MSmits: geppoz likely it doesnt matter
 MSmits: as long as you fit exploration
 MSmits: with the second example, exploration would be 10x higher probably
 MSmits: the param i mean
 darkhorse64: That's what I do. No brainer
 MSmits: it's also what i do
 MSmits: but it doesn't matter
 MSmits: in our example, high branch nodes are explored more initially
 MSmits: actually no
 MSmits: they are explored less 
 MSmits: because you count it as a lot of visits
 MSmits: if you average it, it counts as a single visit
 darkhorse64: It depends if you choose a node by visits or by value
 MSmits: i mean during selection
 MSmits: you always select by both
 darkhorse64: I mean the move to play
 MSmits: yeah, but it doesnt really matter for that, just the way the exploration happens
 MSmits: if you get to a node and the first time you immediately count it as 10 visits, you might not go there again if only 1 child was good
 MSmits: but if you average the result, you might, and you might go to that good child
 MSmits: in games where branching is mostly uniform it should not matter which way you choose
 MSmits: like C4, bandas etc. but on a free move in uttt it's going to matter a lot
 MSmits: anyways, I am using your method darkhorse64, so I guess that works fine.
 geppoz: ok, let's go for it, thanks both&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: My point is adding averages is wrong. 
 darkhorse64: except when the branching is constant
 darkhorse64: slowly but steadily overtaken by jacek :disappointed:
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: make a grimoire&#160;:)
 MSmits: stop the nn menace
 darkhorse64: afk
 jacek:  
 Manchi_o6o7: if someone can help me why is this wrong

 Manchi_o6o7: g is a pointer
 emh: I just published a writeup
 emh: of my StC findings
 emh: regarding the connected components / flood fill bitboards
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/58038/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard">https://tech.io/playgrounds/58038/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard</a>
 emh: MSmits do you perchance have some time to review my article? since you're in education and all :D
 emh: struct maybe you are interested as well?&#160;:)
 olaf_surgut: some one know how to good hash function for two unsigned long longs?
 DaNinja: Manchi_o6o7 try G graph = {1, {'A','B','C','D','E','F'}, NULL}, *g = &amp;graph;
 DaNinja: or use strcpy() to set g-&gt;vertex
 LazyMammal: Manchi_o6o7Same advice basically.  You are trying to use "compile time" initialization with a "runtime" variable.  You can't do that directly.  Either set another way or use memory copy as DaNinja said.
 emh: I try to avoid pointers as much as possible in C++
 emh: they always make me segfault
 emh: when I do use them I tend to use the pattern: BitboardComponentTable&amp; bitboardComponentTable = *(new BitboardComponentTable());
 emh: with no free :p
 emh: but on singletons with lifetime the scope of the program
 jacek: olaf_surgut i just use something like (prime_number1 * A) ^ (prine_number2 * B)
 jacek: :B
 olaf_surgut: kinda cheating, but i like it
 Grandmaster-Loading: study hard
 Manchi_o6o7: Guys, is it okey that I ask here some questions. Not neccessarily connected with CG problems?
 DomiKo: yes
 Manchi_o6o7: So, this is my question. I have some code for MST via Prims algorithms
 Manchi_o6o7: Algorithm*
 Manchi_o6o7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b66eadb9-7225-4ace-b2e6-7ff2f463797d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b66eadb9-7225-4ace-b2e6-7ff2f463797d</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: there you have also my question in the comments
 DaNinja: I think allVisited() will return 1 the first time
 Manchi_o6o7: so !allvisited will be 0
 Manchi_o6o7: and the execution will stop?
 Manchi_o6o7: or you mean !allvisited will be 1
 Manchi_o6o7: wow, for some reason only the first element in the array is set to 1
 Manchi_o6o7: not all the elements
 Manchi_o6o7: isn't array[size]={1}; meaning that all elements are 1
 DaNinja: use array&lt;int&gt; instead
 Manchi_o6o7: isn't array[size]={1}; meaning that all elements are 1
 DaNinja: arrays of local scope are left undefined
 DaNinja: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/">https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/arrays/</a>
 Manchi_o6o7: thank you very much
 darkhorse64: Not completely sure but in C++ {1} is an array of size 1, so you are initializing with a size 1 array
 StevensGino:  array[size]={x} is array of size "size"
 MSmits: yes and I think you're setting the first value to x and the rest to 0?
 MSmits: could be wrong
 emh: hey MSmits
 MSmits: hey emh
 emh: did you see my article?
 MSmits: which
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/58038/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard">https://tech.io/playgrounds/58038/fast-connected-components-for-6x12-bitboard</a>
 MSmits: that's awesome. I did not see it, but I am for sure going to use it to get a stc bot at some point
 emh: thank you. ok&#160;:)
 MSmits: I will do something like that for uttt when i have time. Probably after 24th of june. That's the deadline for my internship report 
 emh: ahh I see. where are you interning?
 emh: thought you are a physics teacher
 MSmits: well, I am interning at my own job, only as CS teacher instead of physics teacher, same school&#160;:)
 emh: ahh hehe&#160;:)
 MSmits: but have to write a report or i wont finish my studies
 emh: I see
 MSmits: next year i am mostly CS teacher
 emh: what's the report on?
 MSmits: probably only 3 hrs a week physics teacher
 MSmits: on being a CS teacher&#160;:)
 MSmits: to get my degree
 emh: hehe ok
 StevensGino: yes @MSmits for your question
 MSmits: have to use a bunch of quesionairres and such filled out by students to prove i dont suck&#160;:)
 StevensGino: :D
 MSmits: ahh ok StevensGino, wasnt 100% sure
 MSmits: I usually just initialize to 0 with { 0 } 
 emh: and you are teaching in Netherlands&#160;? but from Spain?
 MSmits: wait what, did someone hack my flag
 MSmits: nope still says Dutch&#160;:)
 emh: ohh
 MSmits: maybe confused with Marchete
 emh: I must've been color blind last time I checked hehe
 MSmits: he's from spain
 emh: oh ok
 emh: I like Amsterdam
 MSmits: not at all offended, I like marchete&#160;:)
 MSmits: happily confused with him
 MSmits: meh amsterdam is too busy for me
 MSmits: I like quieter places
 emh: yeah for me too at this age, but I liked when I was younger
 MSmits: ahh I see
 emh: partying and clubbing, but now I don't do that anymore
 MSmits: ahh, i never did
 MSmits: I didnt like that sort of thing
 emh: ok. I used to like club dancing
 emh: also did couple dancing
 emh: salsa, bachata and zouk
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: the only time i do physical exercise is on a hometrainer or when i am trying to de-root my backyard
 emh: hehe I also had a treadmill at home, but don't have it currently due to moving
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I went to bigger house so finally have room for one
 emh: ok. only thing I did today was walk to the gas shop to buy energy drinks, and write that article
 MSmits: it was nice during covid
 emh: should write my StC bot.. but don't feel like it
 emh: more like bit fiddling hehe
 MSmits: true, thats more fun
 emh: writing the components but not the final result. kinda silly, but well.. someone else can use it. hehe
 emh: I do have an old StC bot though, from years back
 MSmits: yeah a bit weird
 emh: it's in Gold at rank 115
 emh: yeah
 emh: my old bot uses some fancy tricks with doubly linked lists for the board. don't remember how well it performs though
 MSmits: I see, doubly linked list doesnt sound performant, but hey if the algo is good...
 emh: I think the point of the list was to do incremental flood fills
 emh: on every change
 emh: but I'm not sure how it worked now
 emh: or if it was in that way
 emh: I'm pretty sure the new algo is better though, so no need to go back and look
 emh: with bitboards
 Anequit: I'm suck
 Anequit: stuck
 StevensGino: on what&#160;?
 Anequit: The reverse mode on clash of code
 StevensGino: I don't play much on coc
 StevensGino: I don't even know what is reverse mode
 Dark_bloom: i need help
 sprkrd: emh What's StC?
 StevensGino:&#160;?
 StevensGino: what is StC?
 sprkrd: Dunno, that's why I'm asking :joy:
 StevensGino: haha
 sprkrd: It seems like a Multi, but right now the acronym doesn't ring a bell
 DaNinja: Smash the Code
 sprkrd: ah, I see
 sprkrd: I don't know all the multis by heart :sweat_smile:
 emh: yup it's Smash the Code&#160;:)
 StevensGino: very cool multi
 sprkrd: I've noticed that there haven't been many optimization competitions in the last months/years. When was the last one? Do you remember?
 sprkrd: (question directed to no one in particular)
 emh: well Euler has 4 that I didn't do yet
 emh: haven't been so active lately though
 StevensGino: I am quite new, and really want to know about this also
 DaNinja: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization</a>
 sprkrd: oh, I mean with prizes and such
 sprkrd: at least the t-shirt
 sprkrd: Yeah yeah, I know where they are, it's just that I don't know when was the last "official" optimization contest was. Also some of them have been removed (like the bin packing one)
 sprkrd: when the last official competition was*. God, I wrote that sentence like crap
 emh: A*craft was optimization. from Oct 19 2018
 emh: right?
 emh: I have a number of contests listed after that, but don't remember which of them were optimization
 emh: if any
 sprkrd: I guess beating someone else is just more popular :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 emh: Spring Challenge 2021, Fall Challenge 2020, Ocean of Code, Unleash the Geek, Detektive Pikaptcha, A code of Ice and Fire, Code a la Mode, Xmas Rush, Klee Hackathon, A*Craft. in that order
 sprkrd: Ah, Detective Pikaptcha
 sprkrd: that's the last optimization contest
 emh: ahh ok
 sprkrd: Now it's just a puzzle
 sprkrd: Didn't get to participate on that one
 sprkrd: I don't know why they removed it from the optimization section
 sprkrd: Same with Vox Codei
 StevensGino: :9
 emh: I barely submitted on Detective Pikaptcha
 StevensGino:  Unleash the Geek, don't have any problem related to it
 StevensGino: seems removed
 sprkrd:&#160;:(
 sprkrd: but that was a bot contest right? It's probably harder to make that into a puzzle
 StevensGino: yeah
 jacek: is this it? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/crystal-rush">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/crystal-rush</a>
 sprkrd: tbh, I don't know what "unleash the geek" was about, so it could be?
 StevensGino: thanks, so that's the game
 StevensGino: I think that is the game
 sprkrd: good good, so it seems we still have that one, fortunately
 emh: anyone know if "noexcept" makes a difference in C++ optimization? I copy pasted some operator overloads that used this keyword
 sprkrd: I don't think it makes any difference, specially with optimization flags
 emh: ok I would suspect so
 sprkrd: there's this question in stackoverflow in which the consensus is: "it might make a difference, but it probably won't and in any case it's more for the programmer than for the compiler.

 emh: ahh ok thanks&#160;:)
 a-zA-Z0-9: where can i speak to admins&#160;? 
 MSmits: I think there is this canyon somewhere, where you can scream into it and then you hear an echo, which is like confirmation you got heard
 Westicles: Please hold for my supervisor, Steve.
 MSmits: but you can also ping someone here 
 MSmits: or maybe the forum
 geppoz: MSmits have you way to check if this: 3,4,2,3,1,0,5,3,8,5,5,0 is now a forced loose for red?
 darkhorse64: MCTS is not dead&#160;!
 jacek: oh my
 darkhorse64: more training days :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 MSmits: I can try geppoz
 jacek: more rollouts?
 MSmits: sec
 darkhorse64: smarter exploration
 MSmits: 3,4,2,3,1,0,5,3,8 is already forced loss for red geppoz
 MSmits: 3,4,1 is the correct way to play for red
 MSmits: 2 instead of 1 is the mistake
 MSmits: oh wait, i may not have done it correctly, my board flips automatically sometimes (symmetry), let me recheck
 MSmits: 2 is a mistake regardless
 StevensGino: which game are you discussing?
 darkhorse64: connect4
 StevensGino: ah
 StevensGino: I see
 MSmits: nope i did it correctly
 darkhorse64: submit your bot, join the party
 MSmits: oh hey, what'd you do darkhorse64, got pushed?
 MSmits: or new version?
 darkhorse64: see PM
 ja_fica: How do you verify if a play is win? I verify a 13 long integer array match. Is there a better approach using shifts? 
 StevensGino: already has 245 players, great
 ja_fica: The more the better, more points to everyone&#160;:)
 StevensGino: :D
 darkhorse64: ja_fica: bitboarding is the way
 ja_fica: Yes i use bitboarding
 ja_fica: How else could I verify 13 integers as matchs xD
 ja_fica: I was just wondering if using shifs in the bitboard could be better
 darkhorse64: yes
 darkhorse64: it is
 ja_fica: I'm having doughts as shifting right or left would overflow the row when chekin horizontly
 jacek: use masks then
 darkhorse64: ^
 KOTS98: leave blank spaces at the start and end
 jacek: darkhorse64 ^ isnt mask :v
 ja_fica: I could leave blanks but that would require a manual check for the exception on the corners
 jacek: maybe not the best way but
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8de734bb-712a-4cd2-bdbc-11c37a372ba4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8de734bb-712a-4cd2-bdbc-11c37a372ba4</a>
 ja_fica: right now I use (config[i] &amp; playerstate) == config[i], where there are 13 combinations for each pair (row,col). But I feel this approach provokes cache misses as I read the memory from 63 different position
 jacek: i see no need for additional masks2 and 3 or bottom etc.
 MSmits: whats that monstrosity jacek&#160;? :P
 jacek: one of early versions
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: let me check how i do this. I dont remember 
 MSmits: well shifting has to be accompanied by masks yes. I don't verify win
 MSmits: so cant tell you how thats done
 ja_fica: You don't need to verify win?
 MSmits: I guess, when you play a move, you check in all directions if there's a thingy
 MSmits: no i generate winning moves for opponent when i play a move and if there are any, i lose
 darkhorse64: MSmits bot is so smart it does not need to
 MSmits: but i dont play the winning moves :P
 MSmits: well not in the tree, obviously in the last turn
 MSmits: hmm hey, let me see how i do that
 ja_fica: Anyone anticipates losing move? I tried but it heavy reduced the rollouts at the beginning
 MSmits: hmm i guess me and darkhorse64 do this
 darkhorse64: ^
 MSmits: it does reduce rollouts, but not if you do it efficiently
 MSmits: we both use bitboards and simd for this
 ja_fica: MSmits keeps reducing my points xD
 MSmits: man what a crap submit =/
 jacek: why so low
 MSmits: it's bookless, but i was nr 1 with that every time before this
 MSmits: darkhorse64 did some fixes so he might be stronger now
 MSmits: and you could be, because NN
 ja_fica: I'm not having fast enough rollouts, maybe because of UCT formula
 ja_fica: 60k is the best at the beggining I can wihout verifying wins
 MSmits: I wonder if i'll be 1 with latest book
 ja_fica: How much are you achiving?
 MSmits: 29k each child 
 MSmits: so thats 9x 29k
 ja_fica: much higher
 ja_fica: than me
 MSmits: yes, but that's with simd and bitboards
 MSmits: quickly goes up after turn 2 btw
 ja_fica: I don't even know how to do it without bitboard xD. Using AVX complicates the code significantly for me. You store evey node you passs through or you do independent rollouts?
 darkhorse64: I have 150-170K. Still trying to understand why so low
 MSmits: maybe you have 29k rollouts too
 MSmits: i am multiplying by 9, might not be correct
 MSmits: sometimes this is 1 child only, because of forced moves
 MSmits: early solves etc.
 darkhorse64: right
 darkhorse64: it looks good enough right now
 jacek: and here i am with hmm.. 7k * 9 = 63k nodes?
 MSmits: this is your NN version no&#160;?
 nulte: fix it
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: well then thats fine :p
 ja_fica: You train your NN on python-keras?
 darkhorse64: afk
 jacek: nah, on my home-made NN thingy
 ja_fica: 63 inputs entries?
 jacek: 6 * 63 inputs
 jacek: empty, red, blue. and x2 for side to move
 MSmits: whats the 6 again? 
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: still no flipping huh
 MSmits: mmh my book codesize is 7618 according to code golf
 ja_fica: Using a book sound better then a NN in performance
 MSmits: this is the number that can be 100k?
 MSmits: ja_fica it is only for simple games and only with a fixed start
 Nerchio: and here is me with 10k rollouts
 Nerchio: :innocent:
 jacek: MSmits book + code
 MSmits: ah yeah ofc
 MSmits: code is not much after minify i think. c4 is among my smallest bots
 MSmits: I used 33 million nodes to generate abook using 8% of codesize
 MSmits: so.... half a billion to fill it... nearly?
 MSmits: assuming its even linear
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/562280821">https://www.codingame.com/replay/562280821</a>  neat, a draw&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh and I see another... we draw darkhorse64
 ja_fica: I am amazed at how performant you algo is, it detects the end result at such early stage of the game
 MSmits: not just me, tric trac is fast too
 MSmits: and i assume darkhorse64 as well
 MSmits: but he doesnt use messg to say
 MSmits: mcts solver usually solves better than minimax in my experience.Though tric trac is quite good at it
 kovi: i miss somthing here
 ja_fica: I just the way you know you will lose against me xD
 kovi: 300k rollout, but clearly behind top4
 ja_fica: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/562277348">https://www.codingame.com/replay/562277348</a>
 MSmits: kovi it depends on your definition of rollout
 ja_fica: I can only calculate it after a while .=
 ja_fica:&#160;:)
 MSmits: i think if you just count playouts i have near 200k
 MSmits: but this is with loss avoidance. If yours is total random you're gonna have more
 kovi: i ci tried insta loss avoidance, but it was worse
 MSmits: you mean you lost a lot of rollouts
 MSmits: of course if you lose a lot it's gonna be worse, but if you figure out a way to do it efficiently with simd, it doesnt have to be
 ja_fica: darkhourse vs MSmits, who will win xD
 MSmits: i will but it's not a fair fight atm. I put book back in
 ja_fica: I vote MSmits
 MSmits: darkhorse64 uses no local training for his bot, so if that's your limitation, then he has the best bot I think
 ja_fica: books are allowed so are NN
 ja_fica: NN are better for more complex games that can build a pattern (even a fake one)
 MSmits: sure and i think that is ok. But I try to make an exception for counterbooks. It's really too easy to beat nn's with them
 jrke: MS so you have something trainned offline in C4 bot?
 ja_fica: I have built many drl agents using python-keras, c++ is just too new for me to transfer the code
 MSmits: just meta mcts, I ran 33 million games to get stats to hardcode an opening book
 jrke: oh
 MSmits: it's a sort of training
 MSmits: very simple kind&#160;:)
 Nerchio: is there a best opening MSmits 
 Nerchio: i need some help to boost my performance :joy:
 MSmits: if you incorporate pie rule/steal then it's 1
 MSmits: second from left or right
 MSmits: so can be 7 as well
 MSmits: steal 2, 3 and 4
 MSmits: dont steal 0
 Nerchio: so can i hardcode this :D
 MSmits: sure why not
 jrke: kaggle also have C4 arena but 6*7 board and also no prizes
 Nerchio: 1st player random column 1or7, 2nd player steal 2,3,4
 ja_fica: 6*7 is already solved for best play
 MSmits: 6*7 is too simple. Pretty sure i would have already solved that by now
 MSmits: Nerchio yeah, and you can decide to steal 1 or not, it doesnt matter, it's pretty balanced
 jrke: but MS no cpp on kaggle
 ja_fica: Pure minmax with fre oppening books is enough <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/</a>
 jrke: python and R on kaggle
 MSmits: jrke ahh ok, but how much codesize?
 ja_fica: *few
 jrke: no code limit i think there file size limit
 MSmits: lol easy then&#160;:)
 ja_fica: 6*7 can be solved in 5.490 s without a opening book
 Nerchio: so you have 100% win ratio with people outside of top4?
 jrke: kaggle is for pure NN so no code issue atleas
 MSmits: not 100% I think Nerchio, but pretty good
 ja_fica: He lost against me&#160;:)
 MSmits: yes, you have a non-standard opening ja_fica
 jrke: i installed conda and i need to reinstall every package lol
 ja_fica: Yes, you steal my piece
 Nerchio: damn smits bot is bragging about win like 10 turns ahead
 struct: 10
 Nerchio: :joy:
 struct: more like 30
 MSmits: heh thats the solver, I like it because it helps me figure out bugs
 MSmits: and other people as well
 MSmits: well and it's bragging :P
 Nerchio: btw
 Nerchio: if you say steal 2,3,4 why not 5 and 6 too
 MSmits: it's implied
 MSmits: symmetry
 Nerchio: ok
 Nerchio: wanted to make sure :D
 MSmits: hehe ok
 MSmits: try yavalath, 61 moves to choose from&#160;:)
 MSmits: only 9 unique
 Nerchio: im done with MCTS in java for now
 Nerchio: was a pain to get it to work
 MSmits: it always is
 MSmits: but once you got it working once it gets easy
 MSmits: different language is another story
 Nerchio: and i dont know how to speed it up more i am already using bitset
 MSmits: converted my C# to c++ in two days, was not so bad
 MSmits: bitset?
 MSmits: oh, you cant do normal bitboard in java?
 MSmits: because of that weird integer class?
 Nerchio: i mean just long yeah
 MSmits: or whatever that is
 Nerchio: i misname bitset/bitboard sometimes i guess
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: if this is C4, then you need simd to speed further
 struct: do you pre allocate memory nerchio?
 struct: or is this not possible in java?
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: i create 300k states but idk how many get used like 100k probably
 MSmits: in C# thats really hard somehow, think you need some tricks to preallocate
 struct: is selection still a bottleneck?
 jrke: does anyone know how to remove conda from default python version?
 Nerchio: no struct
 Nerchio: i will check what is but i think playouts now
 Manchi_o6o7: guys, how can I count the number of stack frames for a function in C
 ja_fica: You just also copy/paste the code from UTTT to c4?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/lSpL1aq.png">https://i.imgur.com/lSpL1aq.png</a>
 ja_fica: I did and got rank 11 as soon as I submited xD
 emh: hmm.. I am using 128 bit integers for my StC bitboards. do you think using 8 bits for rows instead of 6 bits would be faster? because of byte lookups instead of shifts?
 emh: well I guess shifts are rather fast anyway, maybe even faster
 MSmits: emh no idea, sounds like the kind of thing that needs to be tried
 MSmits: is this the 128 bit thingy that doesnt work on msvc&#160;?
 struct: yes
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9068631/dereferencing-a-pointer-vs-shifting-for-bytes">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9068631/dereferencing-a-pointer-vs-shifting-for-bytes</a>
 MSmits:  i used that for HS
 emh: HS?
 struct: hypersonic
 emh: ok
 emh: "On any modern computer architecture, the shift operation will complete in a single CPU cycle."
 MSmits: right
 DomiKo: no from NN we got to optimizing C4?
 DomiKo: so*
 struct: grats on rank 1 btw
 DomiKo: :grin:
 MSmits: I think the best possible bot for C4, would be an optimized NN that uses about half the codesize and has the rest filled with opening book&#160;:)
 DomiKo: yeah opening could be needed
 jacek: so you need to breed top1 and top3 bots
 MSmits: yeah
 emh: struct did you catch my article?
 emh: from today
 struct: I saw, I will read it later
 DomiKo: I like that my MCTS does random move for more than half rounds
 emh: ok
 struct: thanks for sharing it
 emh:&#160;:)
 MSmits: DomiKo which game?
 DomiKo: C4
 MSmits: wow, random for half of the game?
 jacek: thats the point of mcts isnt it
 DomiKo: not full random but really close
 MSmits: oh ok
 DomiKo: like every move get the same score 
 MSmits: that can mean many things
 MSmits: sometimes all moves are nearly equally good
 MSmits: (clobber)
 DomiKo: that random early games mean nothing
 MSmits: well there are some moves that cause early losses, so i am sure there must be some exceptions for you too
 jrke: i got something very cool for C4 and bitboards today
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4/blob/master/Position.hpp">https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4/blob/master/Position.hpp</a>
 MSmits: also, people seem to be able to find easily, that move 3 is best
 jrke: everything coded in bitboards
 Nerchio: we have bigger board though
 DomiKo: that one codeed in 128 bits
 DomiKo: soo not that great
 emh: hmm.. if shifts are so fast why does commenting out two of them bring perf from 2.25M to 2.5M.. hmm.. puzzled
 MSmits: usually not a good idea to spend too much time on that sort of thing&#160;:)
 MSmits: been there
 emh: yes I know.. should do the algorithm and win the game instead hehe
 emh: but I just get hooked on microoptimization
 jacek: premature optimization is the root of all evil
 emh: true. little evil me&#160;;)
 Nerchio: is there any trick to finding out a list of moves available 
 Nerchio: :D
 MSmits: from a bitboard?
 Nerchio: yeah
 MSmits: for C$?
 MSmits: 4
 MSmits: hmm
 Nerchio: i do emptyspaces &amp; topmask
 Nerchio: which gives columns
 jacek: there are only 512 possibilities
 Nerchio: and then some shifts and other stuff to find out actual indexes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d274c7b5-adc8-4db1-82bb-878366f465f7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d274c7b5-adc8-4db1-82bb-878366f465f7</a>
 MSmits: this is what i use for initial solution
 MSmits: combined is the sombined bitboard
 MSmits: so you cant play there
 MSmits: after this you increment the moves
 Nerchio: jacek what do you mean only 512?
 MSmits: so dont keep using this
 MSmits: const uint64_t COLUMN = 0x40201008040201;
 MSmits: need that
 jacek: oh i just use moves from 0..8, looking at top row. the actual move is done via shift
 Nerchio: and how do you know how much to shift?
 jacek: lookup heights for each each column
 Nerchio: i do moves with direct index state.playerChips = state.playerChips | (1L &lt;&lt; cellIndex);
 MSmits: i do too
 Nerchio: MSmits thanks i will try to undestand it :D
 jacek: since move generation/play/undo is not most consuming part of my code, i stopped caring :shrug:
 MSmits: it just depends on how slow it is, at some point it becomes a problem, but C4 is fairly easy to sim and NN is always expensive
 Nerchio: my move generation takes too long
 MSmits: if you're going to some depth, keep your last move generation and increment each column by 1
 MSmits: dont regenerate all moves each time
 MSmits: mine isnt particularly fast either, but if you do it only once, it's fine
 Nerchio: i do it every move atm but
 Nerchio: i think i have an idea
 Nerchio: i will just create a map of &lt;cellIndex, columnLong&gt; and i will be able to OR available moves with the columnLong
 Nerchio: i think that sounds good? 
 MSmits: a map?
 MSmits: maps are really slow
 MSmits: use an array then
 Nerchio: true in this case array is fine
 MSmits: i use lookups a lot for boardgames, could be a fine method
 MSmits: did not do a lot of experimentation for C4. i spent half a day coding it and then ran meta mcts for weeks :P
 MSmits: hardest part is to get the draws right in the solver
 MSmits: since they are so rare
 Nerchio: im just happy it works atm :D
 jacek: and you are top1 java :o
 Nerchio: i dont think anyone really tried this with java though lol
 Nerchio: :joy:
 Nerchio: next step: NN with Java? :wink:
 MSmits: If you can do simd in java, i doubt it would underperform much
 MSmits: NN could wreck everyone in java probably
 sprkrd: I don't think SIMD is possible in plain Java
 sprkrd: Anyway, Java is not that bad in terms of performance, is not like a trained NN will take that much time for evaluation, regardless of the language
 jrke: so many on CG are learning NN now
 jrke: inspiration reBless peformance in SC21&#160;? :thinking:
 sprkrd: They're jealous of recurse success in spring2021 :D
 struct: I dont think jealous is the right word
 kovi: inspired
 jrke: its inspiration for me as well
 sprkrd: let me be playful with my choice of words :upside_down:
 Nerchio: hmm
 Nerchio: im inspired and disheartened lol
 Nerchio: that "normal" methods are trash compared to good NN
 sprkrd: I on the other hand dream with toppling the mighty NNs with non-learning approaches
 jrke: which is best NN game to start with&#160;? according to you guys
 kovi: search race
 jacek: w00t
 jrke: yeah i was also thinking SR to no opponent interaction just maximise yourself
 MSmits: jrke if you want a 2 player game, oware is probably best
 jrke: for SR trainning my average score is 0.2 after 450 matches is that bad
 jrke: score i mean 0.2 checkpoints crossed per game
 MSmits: lol
 jrke: is that bad or really bad or worst?
 MSmits: no idea, havent tried nn there
 darkhorse64: does that mean that you never reach the end&#160;?
 struct: that gives like 1/2 checkpoints max per game?
 struct: 1-2
 jrke: struct exactly
 jrke: gettin 0 or 1 and rarely 2

 DomiKo: SR would be good, because then you can upload that to CSB too
 DomiKo: my NN got 13K points fairly easily on SR
 jrke: can you tell me that what could be the average score after 450 matches of training
 DomiKo: depend of what training method you use
 jrke: RL with pytorch
 DomiKo: after 450 full races?
 jrke: yes
 jrke: and i think my inputs are wrong
 DomiKo: I guess you should be easily compliting races
 jrke: what you use as inputs?

 DomiKo: he explains how he made data
 jrke: ah
 VergilX: Hey I need help with a particular question. I tried many times, but my logic doesn't work in one case or another. Where can I ask for help?
 jacek: you can ask here in the chat
 dscientist: well, here
 VergilX: But it's kind of difficult to explain
 VergilX: You know, without knowing which question I'm doing
 VergilX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/aneo">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/aneo</a>
 VergilX: This is what I'm doing
 VergilX: I use Python 3,So basically, the logic I'm using here is I put a list for indicating the status of a light( True when it's green and False when it's red)
 VergilX: I'll tell the rest, it'll take a while to type it out 
 dscientist: structs , "Discussions" or the forum?
 VergilX: Yeah, but nobody has posted anything that can help. They just talk about the way you can correct the approximations(the puzzle has an approximation challenge). But I'm having a problem with the math
 VergilX: I thought the logic I'm using is right, but it seems only a few test cases are right
 dscientist: I mentioned structs but the struct know (the moderator)
 dscientist: I think
 MSmits: ☕
 MSmits: this is funny, there's a cup of coffee in my opening book
 MSmits: also this ⏳
 VergilX: Is the moderator the guy who made the puzzle?
 MSmits: hmm, it gets translated to a chat emote in some way when i paste it
 darkhorse64: your book is typed by an army of :monkey:s

 olaf_surgut: does 97.2&#160;% on mnist dataset is good result for handmade NN?
 olaf_surgut: i see 99.8 best accuracy and think what to do better
 jacek: training or test accuracy
 olaf_surgut: test
 jacek: handmade conv?
 olaf_surgut: normal, without conv
 jacek: then its very good
 jacek: 99.8% is the best possible non-cheating
 jacek: requires very good convnet, data augmentation, optimal parameters etc
 olaf_surgut: so now it's time to play with it
 Smelty: breh i cant make a 4 dimensional list somehow
 jacek: just make 3 dimensional list and add time
 Smelty: welp that what i tryin
 Smelty: kinda
 ddreams: just remember that time and the first three dimensions are connected relativistically
 ddreams: hth
 Smelty: hh
 MSmits: also remember that the dimensions are curved
 MSmits: so curve your list
 Smelty: :eyes:
 ddreams: nice to have such a helpful chat channel
 Smelty: yep
 Smelty: 2 dimensions for the board, 1 dimension for each possible change, and 1 dimension to remember to column
 Smelty: *the
 ddreams: what puzzle are you doing?
 Smelty: connect 4 multiplayer
 Smelty: trying out minimax
 Kethryes: Is anyone in top10 using minmax, or is it only MCTS (or NN?)
 DomiKo: only MCTS  and NN100% 
 kovi: not sure about trictrac
 DomiKo: hmmm
 kovi: he tend to have sophisticated minmax (ab, iterativedeepening, etc)
 Kethryes: Ok, so I have one of the best minmax around yay \o/
 kovi: well done

 MACKEYTH: I'm trying to implement a MCTS for the first time, on Coders of the Caribbean
 MACKEYTH: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-of-the-caribbean">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-of-the-caribbean</a>
 MACKEYTH: Not sure how to select enemy actions between levels
 MACKEYTH: Any advice?
 MACKEYTH: Maybe point me at a resource/tutorial?
 Smelty: well you can try plugging it into your algo from opp's perspective
 Smelty: and select the promising looking ones
 Smelty: i.e. the moves that are best for opponent
 MACKEYTH: Since enemy/player actions are evaluated simultaneously, would you have to create a leaf node for every possible combination of actions from both sides?
 Smelty: idk :p
 MSmits: MACKEYTH you can do that and it's called DUCT
 MSmits: decoupled uct
 MSmits: you won't get much depth with this and require a lot of memory
 MSmits: but it works
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, it'd be something like 16-25 children per node
 MSmits: depends on the game, 16-25 is actually not so bad
 MSmits: but doesnt cotc have more than 2 players at some point?
 MACKEYTH: DUCT info links?
 MSmits: duct becomes hopeless then
 RoboStac: yeah, in the next league you'll have 3 ships each
 MSmits: best to read the forum thread
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, up to 6 agents in the higher leagues. I'm still in Wood
 RoboStac: so then that number becomes huge
 MSmits: then duct is useless MACKEYTH
 MSmits: you could try some form of sequential mcts, but maybe it's better not to use mcts at all
 MACKEYTH: I have discovered that the manual movement commands work in Wood, they're just not provided in the statement
 MSmits: oh, thats nice
 MSmits: I dont know if i even got out of wood in that game
 MACKEYTH: I'm finding it difficult to avoid mines and collisions using only MOVE x y for navigation
 MACKEYTH: The forum thread linked from CotC's bot programming page has &lt;10 posts. Is there a better thread for the game somewhere?
 Smelty: rip
 RoboStac: look for the contest one rather than the multi version
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/coders-of-the-caribbean-feedback-strategies/2746">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/coders-of-the-caribbean-feedback-strategies/2746</a>
 MACKEYTH: That's much better, thx. Game's discussion link should go to that topic instead.
 emh: I split my loop into two: memory access and processing. That was around half as slow. Probably due to no processing while waiting for memory.
 emh: now I am thinking should I use two threads, one for memory access and one for processing. or coroutines. or something. or just revert it to how it was..
 MACKEYTH: Has anyone done benchmark tests to see if a particular language has a processing speed advantage on CG?
 icecream17: wow, my new bot finally beat my old bot... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/562331625">https://www.codingame.com/replay/562331625</a>
 MSmits: MACKEYTH c, c++ and rust are fastest
 MSmits: which one wins depends on the exact use case and i would not be able to give you examples
 MSmits: not all competitive coding on CG needs the fastest language though
 MSmits: the more complicated a game is (more variables, strategy etc.), the more important a well written AI is compared to the choice of language
 MSmits: for simple games, use fast language or accept being out of top 10
 MSmits: but no worries, if you like a game, code in whatever language, go as high as you can. You can always convert to c++ later. I did, it's not that hard
 MACKEYTH: I'm not really fluent in anything but Java
 MSmits: i wasnt either, I wrote a C# bot for uttt, then converted to C++ in two days, this includes reading on what pointers are and all that sht
 MSmits: these are two full time days thpugh, so 16 hrs
 1415495: MSmits: not fun, no troll bait in your answer&#160;;)
 MSmits: it helps if you dont use all sorts of fancy stuff in your language
 MSmits: sorry&#160;:)
 1415495: it was the perfect question for one&#160;:)
 MSmits:  i had like 1 class in my C# bot and the rest was just loops, arrays and functions and such
 MSmits: ah well, lurk in chat all day like jacek and you have tons of opportunity fenrir&#160;:)
 1415495: lol
 jacek: oO
 1415495: but yeah, basically the less fancy stuff (in the perf critical path) the better for perf, and that include anything related to dynamic memory (so no or very few object creation in the critical path)
 1415495: and in 'high level' language they are sometime well hidden unless you know the language well
 MACKEYTH: I am getting the impression that the Wood leagues in CotC are unusually difficult compared to other bot programming games
 HASCII: hello guys ü
 MACKEYTH: HI
 MSmits: MACKEYTH not sure about cotc, but wood leagues aren't all easy
 MSmits: sometimes they take some work
 MSmits: and sometimes just a few lines of code
 Kethryes: Is there a good way to copy/paste all code from the CG interface at once&#160;? When I select all and copy I get only a reduced version with "..." in the middle.
 NomNick: ctrl+A&#160;? 
 aCat: need to access directly from the CG relplay data?
 Kethryes: I mean, I select all (no problem) but when I paste, I only get a small fraction of what is selected...
 Kethryes: (using Firefox btw, maybe I should try with chrome...)
 struct: you mean stderr stuff
 struct:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: sounds like you're outputting too much to stderr with the ...
 Kethryes: No just selecting my code to copy it to a text editor
 Astrobytes: From the CG IDE?
 Kethryes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: That is not something I can reproduce I'm afraid
 Boman: I'm not having an issue either
 Astrobytes: Which text editor are you pasting into?
 Kethryes: Ok, probably something with my Firefox then thx
 Kethryes: anywhere really
 Astrobytes: Very strange issue
 Kethryes: Yeah it's weird, it's as if it copy a collapsed version of the code (but I can see everything uncollapsed on the IDE)

 Synergyforge: Sure wish I were good at, graphs! :D
 Synergyforge: Or deleting comments I added when I was about to say something different.&#160;:)
 Synergyforge: or saying the right word like comma instead of comment.  fml
 Synergyforge: make taco
 Synergyforge: Darn.&#160;:(
 Synergyforge: Is it weird that 358  of my 493 lines of code are commented out versions of prior attempts that I didn't want to totally delete yet? :grimacing:
 drnobody: well, when 2 compilers love each other...  
 MJ_said_hehe: Is there a benefit of sorting a map/dictionary&#160;? The access remains O(1)
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: we are reaching optimization levels that shouldn't even be possible
 Automaton2000: i had to do that
 PranavVK: i just did a clash of code game
 PranavVK: i got 100% on test cases
 PranavVK: 0% on the actual test
 PranavVK:&#160;?????
 PranavVK: and no i didnt hard code if statement for the test cases
 grebz: weeeeee
 MCCV: weeeee
 derjack: :upside_down:
 PranavVK: why are there like 10 people with the avatar
 Synergyforge: Clearly you wrote that number in binary.
 kanav162: plz tell me how can i learn javascript here
 kanav162: i sjust sarted
 kanav162: i dont know anything about coding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kanav162 CG has a decent IDE for you to test code and problems to solve.  Read a book, look at code, then come back.&#160;;)
 Synergyforge: Nah, just watch a couple youtube videos.  Suddenly, expert in field.&#160;:)
 PranavVK: why are there like 9 people with that avatar
 Synergyforge: Counting not your strong suit? I see two with Jian Yang from Silicon Valley.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: JS for me is just modifying the document model, varying css attributes, and modest input field verification.  Not a very good number cruncher.  If you need JSON, i guess you need JS.  You kinda need it for webdesign, but there are alternatives.
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII shrugs</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> MJ_said_hehe: JS and JSON are two different things.
 MJ_said_hehe: independent
 Synergyforge: Yeah JSON is a format for storing data, and isn't required to be used with Javascript..  JS is actually quite powerful these days, and used in a lot of things other than web sites.
 MJ_said_hehe: true, people are making "native" apps with JS
 Synergyforge: I wrote a program for interfacing with my smart panels in Python and it uses JSON for sending and receiving data.
 MJ_said_hehe: that's one of the things that I love about network applications, they are language independent. All you need is a common data format, which can be handled with frameworks like gRPC.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh, not gonna argue... but passing data with JSON model is pretty common, i guess for websafe communications and encryption.  Sure your API gateways can do more now, but that wasn't always so.
 Synergyforge: "JS for me is just modifying the document model"  JS might not even know about a "document model" if it's not running in a browser.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I use JS for web.  I've not had cause to use it otherwise.  No matter how it has been expanded and libs made, etc.  It still runs slow.  JS is a wait another month and someone will come up with something new to tack on. heh
 Synergyforge: It used to be way worse performance-wise.
 Synergyforge: To the point where people would disable JS on all websites because it was more intrusive than useful.  Now, it's literally everywhere and sites will totally break if you're using something like NoScript.  Is that even a thing anymore?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: script insertion is certainly still a thing
 derjack: still better than *ugh* flash
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ^ what derjack said, lol
 MJ_said_hehe: I dunno if JS has gone faster or the machines/browsers.
 MJ_said_hehe: I know latter is faster for sure.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh, my php writes custom JS ... are you 'triggerred' yet? lol
 Synergyforge: I mean, Flash lasted more than 20 years.  That's an eternity for an internet technology.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm Shocked and Waved goodbye
 Synergyforge: And I really quite liked ActionScript 3.  :(
 Synergyforge: i c wut u did thar
 MJ_said_hehe: Some video game dev companies still mention for AS3 as requirements(among others) when looking of a tool developer(dunno the reason).
 Synergyforge: I think some menu systems still use Flash in even AAA games
 Synergyforge: Because there's no real alternative other than writing their own engine for driving menus
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, some games include chrome ... maybe they have anims that have buttons...like &lt;buy addon&gt; ... i dunno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think world of tanks uses an mpeg player served up for the "lastest goodies" kinda thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: has a X close button and a play button
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wthdoiknow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: codec support i guess
 Ajaiy: i finally did it!i finally finished Roller Coaster! 🎉🎉
 Ajaiy: It took such a long time
 Mortis_666: nice
 Ajaiy: I need to thank Wontonimo for the memoization trick, though
 Ajaiy: Hmm... and now it says that "you have won moderation rights". What does that mean?
 Mortis_666: ig it means that u can now approve puzzles?
 Ajaiy: I don't think it means that?
 Ajaiy: that was when you finished 50 clas of codes
 Ajaiy: *clash
 Ajaiy: or 500
 Mortis_666: no i mean approving classic puzzle
 Ajaiy: Oh i see
 Ajaiy: btw does anyone know any very hard puzzle to start with?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unflood the world
 Ajaiy: Official ones?

 Mortis_666: i passed all the test cases of unflood the world but failed one validator&#160;:|
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can see the validators ... i don't have the link to it tho...then you can hardocde the input and see why your code fails
 Mortis_666: where?
 Mortis_666: u mean go to the contribution page of that puzzle?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, i forget ... yup, that
 Mortis_666: ok i found it

 Automaton2000: and do the same thing i guess
 Automaton2000: but i bet it will be fun
 Mortis_666: shakedown Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] Using your superior Charm of 2 you shake 10 :taco:s off of Automaton2000.  9 fall on the floor, 1 got crushed, and you lost 1
 Automaton2000: you can always use the same code
 BJD: take taco
 Mortis_666: take taco
 Automaton2000: dont know what to use
 antiwonto: [auto] BJD has taken 1 :taco:s off the floor and now has 1.  There are 8 left

 Tryst: check taco
 BJD: i dont think you can
 Tryst: rip
 Mortis_666: ya
 Tryst: so i guess i need to get a notepad and type them there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ever play a MUD, aber, diku?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you like text type interactions and lots of bots
 eulerscheZahl: hey PatrickMcGinnisII (was afk)haschcode is over for weeks already, only lasted 4h
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i thought u had a team go to finals
 eulerscheZahl: no, kovi does
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oic
 eulerscheZahl: i might reach topcoder finals, we'll see
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well gl.  I been fightin the optim, ready to put the darn fire out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 7 hours later... some progress
 eulerscheZahl: spontaneous decision: i'll try the april fools contest on codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: starts in 30min
 Tryst: good luck eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: tasks will be weird. harder to figure out the question than to code it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 minutes or two hour contest?
 eulerscheZahl: 2 hours
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 minutes would be an april fool contest
 Tryst: how can i register for the contest
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a codeforces account?
 Tryst: oof nope
 Tryst: i thought it was a codingame contest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 14k registered
 eulerscheZahl: that's actually small by codeforces standards
 Tryst: that's small?
 Tryst: wow
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contests?complete=true">https://codeforces.com/contests?complete=true</a>
 eulerscheZahl: last one had 27k
 eulerscheZahl: and these contest aren't even anything special, they have 1 or 2 each week
 narenza: wow
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1663/problem/H">https://codeforces.com/contest/1663/problem/H</a>that looks like a funny task
 Roger_Rangel: where do we write the code
 Roger_Rangel: :D
 Roger_Rangel: inside the loop?
 Tryst: lol i just registered for the april fool contest and i cant eve figure out the question
 Roger_Rangel: HAHAHAHA
 Roger_Rangel: instructions are not clear :joy:
 Tryst: So I'm just gonna troll and do a simple infinite loop code
 Roger_Rangel: no wait
 Tryst: for every question
 Roger_Rangel: lets solve it
 Roger_Rangel: :D
 Tryst: :D
 Tryst: ok
 Roger_Rangel: where the "f" do we put the code
 Roger_Rangel: i dont get it really
 Roger_Rangel: const lane = 1 thats the first answer
 Roger_Rangel: :joy:
 Roger_Rangel: and then console it
 Roger_Rangel: funny
 Tryst: lol
 Roger_Rangel: hahahha im joking
 Tryst: i think i found the answer
 Tryst: int var = String
 Roger_Rangel: and then?
 Tryst: uh
 Tryst: idk
 Tryst: am just jokin
 Tryst: xd
 Roger_Rangel: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Tryst: still tho its so hard to find the answerrrrrrr
 Tryst: i mean the problemmmmmmm
 Roger_Rangel: the instructions are not clear
 Roger_Rangel: thats the problem
 Roger_Rangel: they should do it as freecocdecamp\
 Roger_Rangel: plain and simple
 Tryst: yes
 Tryst: agree
 Roger_Rangel: nice
 Tryst: shakedown Automaton2000
 Roger_Rangel: the teamwork part is a good idea
 antiwonto: [auto] Automaton2000 needs at least 50 :taco:s to do a shakedown
 Automaton2000: how can i get some help with the power of thor which was ezymode, but then it felt like 0 ...
 Automaton2000: but i found a solution
 Roger_Rangel: anybody found the way to solve this&#160;?
 Tryst: "Time limit per test: 1 second"
 Tryst: lol
 Roger_Rangel: lol
 Roger_Rangel: Kinas
 Roger_Rangel: co to jest ahhahaha
 Roger_Rangel: pomoc nas prosze
 Roger_Rangel: Kinas help us :innocent:
 Tryst: ^
 Roger_Rangel: wow so the solutions
 Roger_Rangel: this is a joke hahahahah
 Roger_Rangel: hahahhahaha what the hell :grin:
 Tryst: XD
 Tryst: I should've known something was fishy since it's april 1st
 Roger_Rangel: hahahha
 Roger_Rangel: sandbox was enough
 Roger_Rangel: what a fraud
 Tryst: lol

 NewCoder09: :taco: Tryst
 antiwonto: [auto] NewCoder09 has awarded Tryst 3 tacos. Tryst now has 8 taco. NewCoder09 now has 4 taco
 NewCoder09: goodwork antiwonto
 NewCoder09: Automaton2000 hi
 Automaton2000: i am trying to figure out what to do

 eulerscheZahl: topcoder sent an email today:"Topcoder Rating Problems? Buy a New One starting April 1st!"
 ZeroGravity003: Hello everyone
 ZeroGravity003: I'm having issues with theh actual instructipon
 ZeroGravity003: Can anyone help me out
 eulerscheZahl: your question is under-specified
 ZeroGravity003: The mad pod racing]
 ZeroGravity003: I was given 6 inputs and asked to make the pod faster 
 eulerscheZahl: and did you?
 ZeroGravity003: I don't even know how to do that??
 eulerscheZahl: there's a speed output ("thrust"). you have to change the value
 ZeroGravity003: Do i have to add that as a new variable
 eulerscheZahl: can you share the current print line
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: nope, he ded
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Wontonimo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 41 tacos
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 51 taco. eulerscheZahl now has 25 taco
 eulerscheZahl: shakedown Wontonimo
 eulerscheZahl: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Using your superior Intelligence of 3 you shake 10 :taco:s off of Wontonimo.  9 fall on the floor, 1 got crushed, and you lost 1
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry eulerscheZahl but you have to give someone else a turn
 Wontonimo: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has taken 5 :taco:s off the floor and now has 46.  There are 4 left
 eulerscheZahl: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has taken 2 :taco:s off the floor and now has 27.  There are 2 left
 eulerscheZahl: how nice of me, isn't it?
 Wontonimo: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has taken 2 :taco:s off the floor and now has 48.  There are 0 left
 Wontonimo: hey, i ended up with more tacos
 Wontonimo: eat :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has eaten 10 :taco: and your Swag is now 7.  You have 38 left
 Wontonimo: eat :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has eaten 10 :taco: and your Intelligence is now 2.  You have 28 left
 eulerscheZahl: i'm actually surprised that i managed to beat you in a random skill
 Wontonimo: I haven't been farming tacos
 Wontonimo: your Int of 3 beat my Int of 1
 eulerscheZahl: but you can always give you bonus points via code
 Wontonimo: i play by the same rules, makes it fun
 Wontonimo: there are no 'special cases' for me
 Westicles: no new event today?
 eulerscheZahl: we have april fool's contest on codeforces
 eulerscheZahl: you'd love the last task - i'm sadly clueless

 Westicles: hmmm
 PainEXE: in mad pod racing i keep on turning too slow and doing like 3 loops around the check point
 PainEXE: how do i fix that
 Hugesn0wduck: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/667867563/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/667867563/</a>
 Hugesn0wduck: spent a while on this xd
 Hugesn0wduck: get extra credit though
 Wontonimo: got slower when you are close or your angle is too large PainEXE
 Wontonimo: you can't change the speed of turning, all you can do is change the thrust
 Westicles: nothing jumps out euler, not sure how to do that
 Hugesn0wduck: can yall suggest what i should add to my scratch project before i actually spend the time coding it?
 inoryy: it's been over 2 minutes and nobody suggested magic formula? back in my day...
 inoryy: PainEXE set thrust = 100; target_x = checkpoint_x - 3 * velocity_x, same for _y
 PainEXE: thank you
 Hugesn0wduck: but yall, is it weird that i still use scratch to make a basic version of my coding ideas?
 Wontonimo: oh inoryy ... we don't just give it away like that anymore
 PainEXE: inorryy i dont have velocity _ x yet
 Wontonimo: btw :wave: inoryy&#160;!!!  Nice to see you 
 eulerscheZahl: MK has left and we don't even miss him
 PainEXE: but when that shows up Ill do it
 inoryy: :wave:
 Wontonimo: you need to "calculate" velocity
 inoryy: PainEXE you can estimate it from given inputs
 Wontonimo: -3v
 antiwonto: [auto] '-3v' was defined as ' A PID controller reference for mad pod racing. Check out <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a> '

 Wontonimo: scratch is great!  not weird at all imho
 Hugesn0wduck: mk good, i just use it as a idea maker
 inoryy: scratch is awesome, do whatever works for you
 Hugesn0wduck: i dont really have the time to code much anymore
 Hugesn0wduck: so scratch is great for simple ideas before spending time to code
 Wontonimo: scratch is coding, don't let anyone convince you otherwise
 Hugesn0wduck: true, but i personally think of it as an idea complier, its really nobody but their own opinions
 Hugesn0wduck: also i havent used this account in 3-4 years xd
 Hugesn0wduck: i truely have matured i think&#160;:(
 Hugesn0wduck: not saying yall arent mature, im just saying that i used this as a younger self, and i dont use it anymore
 Hugesn0wduck: i actually got into art now, so coding helps with digital art like animations
 Wontonimo: there isn't anyone here who used this in the past who wasn't younger at the time.
 Hugesn0wduck: well thats a fact XD
 Hugesn0wduck: bruh i cant believe i used swift in the past, i cant really see myself doing that
 Hugesn0wduck: also
 Westicles: except that guy from Tralfamadore the other day
 Hugesn0wduck: <img alt="Screenshot 2022-04-01 11.41.01 AM.png" />

 Hugesn0wduck: lol
 Hugesn0wduck: just for a reference of what that photo would be
 Hugesn0wduck: i defined physics
 Hugesn0wduck: in code

 Hugesn0wduck: so question yall, what should i add to my scratch project before i actually code it
 Hugesn0wduck: if you would like the project to eb linked again, please just ask
 Hugesn0wduck: be*
 eulerscheZahl: changed it to this as well Westicles. passes all but the final validator
 eulerscheZahl: only validators use division

 Hugesn0wduck: back
 Hugesn0wduck: im listening to piano and just grinding out my coding
 Hugesn0wduck: Xd
 Tryst: im just listening to the sound of my keyboard when im coding 
 Tryst: it calms me down
 NewCoder09: Same 
 Westicles: calms you down because you are on the spectrum, or just in general?
 NewCoder09: Just calms me down from the way the button click

 Lachrymosa: Is anyone available to help me troubleshoot a minor error?
 Lachrymosa: I say minor because it still executes somehow, but it flags an error nonetheless... unless this is an Apr 1 prank
 Wontonimo: start explaining and see who helps
 Lachrymosa: In Python I have a function that returns a tuple (x,y)  and stores it in a dicitonary. When accessing the first or second value of the tuple i do dict[key][index] it is printing the expected result but the error is also saying  TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
 Wontonimo: on what line, and what is the code on that line
 Lachrymosa: holder=(second[a][0]+(second[a][0]-first[a][0]),second[a][1]+(second[a][1]-first[a][1]))
 Wontonimo: and what is in 'second'&#160;?
 Wontonimo: the compiler knows that it is an int.  What do you want in there?
 Lachrymosa: I want a dictionary with the value being a tuple of ints
 Wontonimo: what's the key of the dictionary?
 Lachrymosa: a single letter string
 Wontonimo: show us the line of code where you add the tuple to the dictionary
 Lachrymosa: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/uhjTmtke">https://pastebin.com/uhjTmtke</a>
 Wontonimo: nope, sorry, i don't have access to unsecure websites.
 Lachrymosa: My function getCoord returns the tuple and it is added in the second for loop to the dictionary

 Lachrymosa: Is pastebin unsafe? Should I not use it?
 Wontonimo: your getCoord can return -1 instead of a tuple.  
 Wontonimo: -1 is an int last i checked
 Westicles: Is Discord secure?  Gets blocked at work for alot of people
 FrancoRoura: No CodinGame logo in r/place?
 Lachrymosa: ach, you're right. I incorrectly assumed the error was with the correctly returned thing I wanted, but it is from the 'none' results. Thanks
 PainEXE: Can someone explain how to calculate velocity in mad pod racing
 Uljahn: difference between coordinates at current and previous turns?
 eulerscheZahl: probably for distraction, Westicles
 eulerscheZahl: companies don't want their employees browsing the web at paid time
 eulerscheZahl: or find an optimal layout for scrabble
 Westicles: heh heh
 Wontonimo: hey PainEXE, velocity is calculated like this
 Wontonimo: ( current - previous ) / time
 Wontonimo: but since each turn is 1 you can get rid of the time
 Wontonimo: so it becomes
 Wontonimo: current_location - previous_location
 PainEXE: how do i get current and previous and how do i get time
 PainEXE: Failing rn
 Wontonimo: you don't need time, like i said, it's always 1
 PainEXE: k
 PainEXE: do i just say if dist ==0
 PainEXE: then its previous time
 PainEXE: and x is current location?
 Wontonimo: you have your current location yeah?
 PainEXE: ye
 Wontonimo: okay, and do you know how to make a new variable&#160;?
 PainEXE: Yup
 Wontonimo: great
 PainEXE: do i just assign it to dist==0:?
 Wontonimo: so make a new variable called previous
 Wontonimo: and at the end of your main loop assign previous = current
 Wontonimo: done, now you have previous and current
 PainEXE: thx
 Wontonimo: i don't know what this dist==0 thing is you keep talking about, but it's not that
 Uljahn: also the very first turn is kinda special, because your previous has no relevant information stored in it yet, but you can assume the speed is 0 for this turn
 Wontonimo: meh, don't confuse her with edge cases
 Wontonimo: or him.  idk actually
 eulerscheZahl: i still think CSB shouldn't be an onboarding
 Wontonimo: what would be a better one?
 eulerscheZahl: heavily confused me when they never explained what the angle means and that you can only turn by 18°
 eulerscheZahl: anything grid based
 Uljahn: uTTT
 antiwonto: [auto] 'UTTT' was defined as ' Ultimate TicTacToe '

 eulerscheZahl: or even with a lower value
 eulerscheZahl: while the starting value doesn't even matter. only the solution for the remainder, to which you can add the current value
 eulerscheZahl: and you didn't delete your code, still visible in the edit history of your post&#160;;)

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey EleanorJ, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 Synergyforge: omg I just discovered middle-click-dragging works in this IDE. :D :D :D
 Magmi: Добрый день
 a-Rye: Lol, google translate is awesome! Good afternoon to you as well!
 Magmi:&#160;?
 a-Rye: @Eleanorj it's best if you just throw your question out there. If someone thinks they can help, often they'll speak up
 a-Rye: مساء الخير لكم أيضا!==  Добрый день
 a-Rye: Yeah, I'm waiting to see how much is wrong in my OSCS translation I did. I have some Colleagues looking at it soon and they'll let me know how far off Google Translate was
 Magmi: just out of curiosity, did this site put sanctions on russia? are people from russia allowed to compete?
 a-Rye: I was just speaking with someone from Russia two nights ago? As far as I know, everyone is still welcome here
 Westicles: of course they are
 Magmi: interesting
 Westicles: Founder Codi Ngame spoke about this in her blog, if you read vietnamese
 Synergyforge: Wait that's a person's name?!
 Synergyforge: Oh.  April 1.  Gottem.
 wlesavo: but tibo actually talked about this
 Magmi: many companies sanction russia
 Uljahn: and many don't
 Magmi: sadly
 Uljahn: guess developers are quite welcomed in Europe and brain drain is still a thing
 Synergyforge: Saw a video posted recently to Twitter from Kyiv, driving through the streets of a neighborhood, and there are dead bodies everywhere.  Looked like they were just murdered in the streets.  One was still on a bike, lying on the ground, like he just fell over while riding.  Eerie, disgusting stuff/
 Magmi: best programmer are born in russia and belarrusiia
 Magmi: nobody know why but it may be due to gene hacks
 Synergyforge: haha
 Magmi: its true
 Magmi: best programmer in world is from belarussia
 Magmi: and in top 50 there is a lot more
 Uljahn: so you want to sanction them to increase your chances, that's smart
 Magmi: no i dont want sanctions. i am afraid of my job in europ
 Uljahn: just don't be lazy and be competitive [solved]
 macobo: Paying taxes within russia literally funds the bombing of cities and killing of ukrainians.
 macobo: Very little about competitiveness here - rather, don't cooperate with evil.
 Magmi: it was just a question dont need to be so aggressiv
 macobo: If you're in russia and you can get out, please do!&#160;:) A lot of international companies with russian origins have exited their employees within the last month
 Synergyforge: There's not much of a free press in Russia, so many citizens don't even know what to believe.
 Westicles: there's not much of a free press anywhere
 Synergyforge: The fact that we have right-wing propaganda outlets in the USA proves that we have a free press.  Just because we disagree doesn't mean it's evidence of some oppressive state manipulation machine.
 Magmi: US is full of left wing propaganda, what does not fit the narrative is censored, most of the vocal individuals are already banned from everywhere
 Magmi: massive censorship in US by the tech oligarchs

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Synergyforge, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 2 tacos

 Synergyforge: Science, REAL science, is objective and independent of bias.  But you won't hear that on Faux Noise.&#160;:)  Also, I made southwest veggie soup last night and homemade tortilla chips. That's kind of like tacos, right?&#160;:)
 Girlperson: i love tacos! But what does 14 tacos mean?
 Synergyforge: It's just a fun little toy for chat to play with. :D
 ASM_MOV_INT: it means i have 14 tacos

 Synergyforge: I went to school for graphic design but now I'm wishing I did computer science.&#160;:(
 AzrielCodes: i'm gonna go improve my code in the racing thing
 Wontonimo: what's a problem you were given in an interview (and btw, congrats on taking it seriously enough to practice now)
 Synergyforge: Like, a graph problem is where you have a bunch of pieces of data that can represent something like street addresses or places an AI can walk in a game.  You have to figure out something like, find a path from this point to another point.
 Wontonimo: GO AzrielCodes GO&#160;!
 AzrielCodes: whoaaah
 AzrielCodes: how did you do that?!?!?!
 Wontonimo: do what?
 Wontonimo: red text?
 Synergyforge: Or like Google Maps finding a route on your GPS.  It's constantly solving graph problems.

 Wontonimo: so, is this a graph problem like what you were asked <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/river-crossing">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/river-crossing</a> Synergyforge
 Synergyforge: Hmm... Not sure if that's a graph problem, so much as a logic solving challenge.  Wontonimo I was more thinking something like this, which has the added challenge of not knowing what the entire graph looks like before you explore it.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-labyrinth">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/the-labyrinth</a>
 Synergyforge: So in order to find the shortest path, you have to know all the possible paths
 Synergyforge: which means you first have to decide where to start exploring, while avoiding the walls.
 AzrielCodes: could you use multithreading?
 AzrielCodes: i don't know how that works in other languages
 Synergyforge: Not sure what that would gain you for this problem, since each tick, you have to make a move, and you can only move one space at a time.   You pick a north, south, east, or west direction, and then you get an updated graph and make another decision based on the new data.
 Wontonimo: no, multithreading isn't going to help until you have a good algo
 AzrielCodes: oh
 Wontonimo: do you know about A* search Synergyforge 
 AzrielCodes: i see now
 Synergyforge: Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: and floodfill&#160;?
 Wontonimo: that's my name
 AzrielCodes: i didn't look at the problem sorry
 Synergyforge: Wontonimo I know ABOUT it, but... :P  I tried for a while to get it working with that one but I'm just not good enough yet.  I had a solution that worked for two of the challenges, but then I abandoned that method.
 Wontonimo: okay, can I help you with A*&#160;?
 Synergyforge: lul you can try
 Wontonimo: cool cool, so I'm guessing you know about queues, arrays, and sorts right?
 Synergyforge: I just looked up a couple videos and read some internet posts about it, but this one is tough because I have to decide where to start moving, and then keep trending that direction until I have a better option once I uncover more of the map
 Synergyforge: yeah
 Wontonimo: okay, so here is A* in a nutshell for a 2d grid 
 Wontonimo: where movement from 1 square to an adjecent square all costs the same
 Synergyforge: I had a heuristic that calculated the distance from where I am to all the connected nodes I can currently see,  then I got stuck.
 Wontonimo: you have a starting position, and an ending position (x,y)
 Synergyforge: yeah that was one thing I was struggling with, picking an ending position, since, technically, it should be one step away since I get a new grid each time
 Synergyforge: until I see the goal, like the control room or transporter
 Synergyforge: Once I see one of those, I can just plot a path to it
 Synergyforge: but I struggled with it for like 3 days before I was like eff it
 Synergyforge: kinda new to graphs
 Wontonimo: ok
 Wontonimo: so, how can i help? 
 Synergyforge: I dunno, I just feel like I was having difficulty with the implementation.
 Wontonimo: A* is like floodfill, except instead of using a stack, you use a sorted queue.  As for the details I can help you with it
 Wontonimo: ^^ does that make sense?
 Synergyforge: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70bc2dc0-6e5a-4c7b-9b98-5549950571c7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70bc2dc0-6e5a-4c7b-9b98-5549950571c7</a>
 Synergyforge: Guess I typed too much&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: yup, i read it though
 Synergyforge: anyway my brain is foggy right now.  I need to go unwind for a bit.  
 Synergyforge: Not even really sure how to do flood fill
 Synergyforge: but I'm gonna go for a little ride on my motorcycle to unwind.  If you want, you can message me and I'll see it later... or I'm sure I'll see you around here. :P
 Wontonimo: oh, that's a good place to start!  It is super useful and really not that hard once you are shown
 Synergyforge: yeah I'll try that next
 Synergyforge: thanks
 Synergyforge: my first implementation, I just got all the '?' on the grid, and went in the direction that most of them were (to my left, right, up, or down) as long as it wouldn't run me into a wall.
 Synergyforge: the big empty one, with the control room in the lower right, it went to the middle, and then got stuck there in a loop.
 Synergyforge: then I did more of a pathfinding solution, and it got me to the control room and back, and that was one of the ones I was able to pass.
 Synergyforge: but it was bad at finding its way through a maze
 Synergyforge: Anyway I'll prolly be back on later if you're still willing to give me some hints. :P
 Wontonimo: hows the mad pod doing AzrielCodes&#160;?
 PainEXE: Anyone mind giving me some feedback on my puzzle? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/11533e190b55b63be956c0a928a28afdbe6fe">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/11533e190b55b63be956c0a928a28afdbe6fe</a> thanks
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey PainEXE, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 KalamariKing: interesting hypothesis, however your mother
 AzrielCodes: hello
 AzrielCodes: i kinda went to go do stuff so yeah
 Wontonimo: hey
 AzrielCodes: wow you're up?
 Wontonimo: yup
 AzrielCodes: dang
 AzrielCodes: committed
 Wontonimo: how's the pod racing going?  want more help?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII yawns</b></p><p><img src="/a/81211382445325" /> AzrielCodes: i just started working on it right now
 AzrielCodes: it seems like a decently simple challenge
 Wontonimo: something easier than distance, is to check your angle
 AzrielCodes: just a lot of tweaking to get the right formulas
 Wontonimo: if abs(angle) &gt; some_threshold then use thrust of 0
 Wontonimo: otherwise thrust 100
 AzrielCodes: oh?
 Wontonimo: don't need to do distance
 AzrielCodes: ok
 Wontonimo: yeah, if you are pointed away from the next checkpoint, should you really be thrusting?
 AzrielCodes: that is a good point
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 AzrielCodes: lol thanks
 Wontonimo: start with 90 
 AzrielCodes: as a thrust value?
 Wontonimo: max abs(angle)
 AzrielCodes: oh
 Wontonimo: thust = abs(angle) &lt; 90&#160;? 100&#160;: 0;
 Westicles: pain finally got approved
 AzrielCodes: does that if statement work in java?
 Wontonimo: i don't know what programming lang you are using.  probably javascript
 AzrielCodes: i use java right now
 Wontonimo: are you doing java now?  cuz your original bot is javascriipt
 AzrielCodes: i don't think it has shorthand for if statements
 AzrielCodes: yeah i switched to java
 Wontonimo: yes, java does
 AzrielCodes: oh
 AzrielCodes: enlighten me please
 Wontonimo: it's called a ternary , and most all languages have it
 AzrielCodes: i hadn't seen the java version used before to be completely honest
 AzrielCodes: does it work like c#?
 Wontonimo: here is a code example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/dCz6v7J">https://tech.io/snippet/dCz6v7J</a>
 AzrielCodes: ok thank you for that
 AzrielCodes: it makes coding much easier
 AzrielCodes: i hadn't realized java had ternary
 AzrielCodes: for if statements
 MarvinChen: i want to learn how to code
 MarvinChen: is there an easier way
 TimberStalker: Than what?
 AzrielCodes: codecademyyy
 AzrielCodes: that's where all my knowledge comes from
 MarvinChen: okay thanks
 Wontonimo: practice on your own.  start with really easy programs like hello world, and listing prime numbers. 
 MarvinChen: how would i do that?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;alt&gt;+&lt;f4&gt; opens help menu
 AzrielCodes: i like this website a lot because it provides challenging... challenges xD
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII april fools!</b></p><p><img src="/a/81211382445325" /> AzrielCodes: PatrickMcGinnisII that's true
 Wontonimo: practice those easy programs on your own without internet, without looking at your previous work, without autocomplete until you can do it from memory or understanding.
 AzrielCodes: ph
 MarvinChen: where can i practice that
 AzrielCodes: oh*that sounds very hardcore
 TimberStalker: Im having trouble in The Labyrinth puzzle 05. How do you get from C to the starting point in 42 moves?
 Wontonimo: then add a harder program, and repeat, not moving onto a harder program until you can do it from understanding or memory.  do it on your computer
 Wontonimo: no, not hard AzrielCodes, just takes time.  You will learn A LOT&#160;!  Like how to fix your own bugs, how to understand large blocks of code quickly, how to remember large blocks of code quickly
 AzrielCodes: i take the slower approach xD i mostly do this for fun
 Westicles: what language does PatrickMcGinnisII use?  oh yeah
 Westicles: php
 antiwonto: [auto] 'php' was defined as ' A zombie walks into a brain store. On the shelves, a pound of C++ programmers' brain sells for $500, of Java programmers, $1000, and of PHP programmers, $1,000,000. The zombie gets confused and asks the store owner why PHP programmers' brain is so much more expensive. The owner says "do you know how many PHP programmers I kill to get one pound of brain?" '
 MarvinChen: what do you mean by hello world?
 Wontonimo: print("hello world")
 MarvinChen: oh i know that
 AzrielCodes: lolll
 Wontonimo: thaht's all i mean
 AzrielCodes: antiwonto
 antiwonto: [auto] 'antiwonto' was defined as ' A bot, possibly assembled in Central America. Programming questionable '
 AzrielCodes: that was funny
 MarvinChen: i already know how to do print ("hello world")
 AzrielCodes: ew python doesn't use semicolons
 MarvinChen: what else can i do with it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Westicles has jokes.&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: how about printing all the odd numbers from 1 to 100 except numbers that have a "w" in them
 MarvinChen: oh i dont know
 Wontonimo: there you go, you now have a puzzle
 MarvinChen: thanks
 MarvinChen: ill try to figure it out now
 Wontonimo: OH&#160;!  you have submitted your bot AzrielCodes&#160;!
 AzrielCodes: yes i have
 AzrielCodes: just as a test for right now
 Wontonimo: it's killing it
 AzrielCodes: meh
 AzrielCodes: it's pretty bad xD
 AzrielCodes: that's the fun part though
 AzrielCodes: making it better
 Wontonimo: you have been promoted to the next league!  what do you mean it is pretty bad?
 AzrielCodes: i can see it being much better
 AzrielCodes: this was only one line of code
 AzrielCodes: i can do better
 Wontonimo: you can.  i'm so disappointed in you.  hang you head in shame
 Wontonimo: hehe
 AzrielCodes: xD
 Wontonimo: do you know about arrays&#160;?
 AzrielCodes: yes i do
 AzrielCodes: i know most of the basics
 Wontonimo: cool, then you could store the checkpoints in an array as you pass them
 Wontonimo: and once you see a checkpoint again then you know you have found them all and in order
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: and with that you could set up better runs with better angles
 AzrielCodes: ooohhh
 AzrielCodes: very smart
 AzrielCodes: i'd mostly just thought of using equations
 AzrielCodes: i'm an algebra oriented person lol
 Wontonimo: okay, if you'd like to do equations then i've got this for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 Wontonimo: it's PID controller info.  Very equation oriented!  
 AzrielCodes: thank you so much
 Wontonimo: it's fantastic for this kind of challenge
 AzrielCodes: you have a wide variety of knowledge
 Wontonimo: :grin:
 AzrielCodes: loll
 Wontonimo: :taco: AzrielCodes
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry Wontonimo but you can only award tacos once per day
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 AzrielCodes: and you are very amigable
 MarvinChen: numbers = list(range(1,100)for num in numbers:
 AzrielCodes: i don't know the word in english
 MarvinChen: did i do it?
 AzrielCodes: the word is amicable
 AzrielCodes: i'm dumb
 Wontonimo: nope.  That will print number that are spelt with the letter 'w'
 MarvinChen: oh yeah i forgot that part
 MarvinChen: how would i do that?
 Wontonimo: first step in these kinds of problems is thinking of how I, as a human, would go about solving that
 MarvinChen: you would have to check each letter in each number from 1 to 100
 MarvinChen: actually
 Wontonimo: one - no W, three - no W, five ...
 MarvinChen: you only have to check the ones with a 2
 MarvinChen: so all numbers with a 2 should be excluded from the ouput
 Wontonimo: hint, 23 is not okay
 MarvinChen: numbers = list(range(1,100)for num in numbers&#160;!= 2:
 MarvinChen: is there a way to check if a two is included in a number
 Wontonimo: i don't know of a language where that code will run
 MarvinChen: python
 Wontonimo: in pythonif "2" in str(num)&#160;:
 Wontonimo: or if "2" not in str(num):
 MarvinChen: ohh
 Wontonimo: for num in range(1,101):
 MarvinChen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/939ff354-b2ff-4267-b624-8461903a6f04">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/939ff354-b2ff-4267-b624-8461903a6f04</a>
 Wontonimo: nope, your code won't work the way you want it to.
 Wontonimo: did you even try running that code?
 MarvinChen: nope
 MarvinChen: where can i run it
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet?l=python">https://tech.io/snippet?l=python</a>
 MarvinChen: oh it showed errors
 MarvinChen: your code worked perfectly]
 MarvinChen: ill ttyl

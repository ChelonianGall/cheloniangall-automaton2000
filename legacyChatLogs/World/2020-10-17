 LinhT.Nguyen: that was weird as shit problem tho.....
 Laminator: which one? lol

 codeing: waiting answer there #codeing
 codeing: is my code complexe&#160;?
 jacek: happy Caturday
 Shrimpster: any free python bootcamps yall can recommend? My little brother is starting to code
 Tiki69: hey can someone help with a question?Minimun number of swaps to make an adjecent of an array equalexp-&gt; [2,1,2,1]      output 1 As Swap 2nd and 3 red index
 Neumann: Are you guys using Beam Search in the top 8 of 2048&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you should ask that on #ru
 eulerscheZahl: i don't understand a word but they are actively discussing it by the numbers i see there
 geppoz: i dont know how it is called,
 geppoz: i create a full tree of a certain depth, say 8
 geppoz: then i evaluate all the leafs, choose the best and i go up the tree for some steps, then i restart from there
 geppoz: with that, i am above Euler :D
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 geppoz: that's enough for me :D
 eulerscheZahl: what to expect next (not an optim):<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/v12mud">https://prnt.sc/v12mud</a>
 geppoz: that method of mine has a name?
 eulerscheZahl: sounds a bit like beam search
 eulerscheZahl: yet different
 eulerscheZahl: and i doubt it's more effective than a regular beam search
 geppoz: the difference would be to choose a set, not a single one to restart, right?
 eulerscheZahl: and not go back multiple steps
 eulerscheZahl: list of boards =&gt; expand alltake best n
 eulerscheZahl: repeat
 geppoz: expand all =&gt; 1 step only?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: give it a try
 Intp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1423654aba198072da292d6c8f3740eb9fb0d6f">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1423654aba198072da292d6c8f3740eb9fb0d6f</a>
 geppoz: i think that requires a very good scoring evaluation
 geppoz: while going deep allows good results even with poor score eval
 eulerscheZahl: it's not much different to what you do
 eulerscheZahl: going multiple levels deep is the same as having a wide beam
 eulerscheZahl: that is keeping many nodes
 Neumann: What's your BS width euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to print everything up to the final node at the end
 eulerscheZahl:     const int searchDepth = 30;
 Neumann: wow
 Neumann: You must have some fancy eval function
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/738ecabc-a6c1-4870-a0a7-5507a1f8a4a8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/738ecabc-a6c1-4870-a0a7-5507a1f8a4a8</a>
 eulerscheZahl:             double result = 0;
 eulerscheZahl: and so on, forming a snake
 Neumann: wat
 eulerscheZahl: i dont even score the game score
 eulerscheZahl: just the number on each tile with different factors
 eulerscheZahl: rewarding a large number in the corner
 geppoz: fixed snake? i did double sided snake
 eulerscheZahl: fixed for me. Ille has 2 snakes as well
 geppoz: what means printDepth?
 eulerscheZahl: i should also score "movability"only a single legal action that is RIGHT is deadly for me
 eulerscheZahl: tried not to print all of my plan
 Neumann: Why the top left-corner would reward 6561 times more than the bottom-left corner&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: to recover from that RIGHT-only
 eulerscheZahl: if that's 9^4, then yes
 Neumann: I don't understand the logic of your eval :D
 Neumann: Favor tiles stacked in a corner, ok
 eulerscheZahl: did you ever play by hand?
 Neumann: But why a corner more than another&#160;?
 Neumann: A bit yes
 eulerscheZahl: give me a moment to make a screenshot
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/v12srs">https://prnt.sc/v12srs</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i reward snakes
 Neumann: That I can see. But what if your screenshot was inverted, center-rotation
 Neumann: Same board value
 Neumann: Very different eval result
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's the top left. but that's completely arbitrary
 eulerscheZahl: just take 1 corner and stick with it
 Neumann: Ok
 Neumann: Interesting
 geppoz: the important think is you dont reward two corners in the same board
 geppoz: eval the "direction" of the board, and reward only toward any corner
 geppoz: i do it for the two top corners
 Neumann: brb stealing your idea
 eulerscheZahl: i see you beating me soon
 geppoz: i still didnt understand what do you mean with "print" depth
 eulerscheZahl: while my beamsearch knows my plan for several turns, i don't print all of them
 eulerscheZahl: you go some levels deeper to detect a dead end and go back up
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't print everything
 Neumann: How did you came up with that eval&#160;? You figured out the game&#160;? That's pretty smart
 eulerscheZahl: too much playing by hand
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/v136f6">https://prnt.sc/v136f6</a>
 Neumann: Nice
 wlesavo: Neumann yeah, mostly beamsearch with snake eval, at pure bruteforce with depth 7 i was at 28M
 wlesavo: i think anyone who played the game came up with the same eval separately, which is pretty funny actually
 BoBot: exactly - I was like - "what snakes?!" and then when I saw the screenshot - oh yea I used to do that as well :D
 codeing: hi gaystell me there #codeingwhat you think about this puzzlethat's my answer

 Astrobytes: again codeing?
 codeing: sure
 codeing: i'm shaked
 AntiSquid: codeine&#160;?
 AntiSquid: (pain drug)
 codeing: explain
 Astrobytes: I know, it take it 4 times a day
 codeing: why pain drug&#160;?
 AntiSquid: because that's what it is
 Astrobytes: codeine and codeing, different by 1 letter only
 codeing: mhm
 AntiSquid: Codeine is an opiate used to treat pain, coughing, and diarrhea.
 codeing: codeing == code in present continuous
 codeing: so code ing
 Astrobytes: *coding
 codeing: same
 Astrobytes: You drop the e
 AntiSquid: codeing is like short for treating pain with codeine
 AntiSquid: the perfect verb for it
 Astrobytes: "every day I'm codeing"
 codeing: sure&#160;?
 Astrobytes: totally untrue actually
 Astrobytes: anyway codeing, why are you showing everyone that code from hell again?
 codeing: Astrobytes how is this code the hell&#160;?
 codeing: make me feedback there
 codeing: #codeing
 Astrobytes: we gave you feedback on it last night
 codeing: you rigth
 codeing: cya
 Astrobytes: remember? Hard to read, inefficient, extremely verbose
 codeing: what verbose&#160;?
 Astrobytes: You asked that last night too
 codeing: was tired
 Astrobytes: In this case, more code than required
 Tiki69: hey can someone help with a question?Minimun number of swaps to make an adjecent of an array equalexp-&gt; [2,1,2,1]      output 1 As Swap 2nd and 3 red index

 Sylarb91: can anyone guide me on the temperatures puzzle&#160;?
 jrke: in temperatures you have to output nearest int to 0 
 jrke: means minimum absolute value
 Sylarb91: i already did that... let me be more specific
 Sylarb91: i fail on the 3rd and 5th test because i dont know how i can output the positive value
 jrke: use if else 
 thanhhv317: Hi 
 Sylarb91: yo
 Neumann: wlesavo: How would you reach 28M with depth 7&#160;? 7 moves per turn doesn't allow you to get that high. Did you do several depth 7 BF per turn&#160;?
 geppoz: +1 (me too dont get that)
 Rodian: Can I restart coders strike back?
 jacek: what do you mean by restart
 radwl: hi
 wlesavo: Neumann yeah, several, you need around 30-40k moves, so once you reached depth 7 you add moves to the pool and continue the search
 Neumann: Ok
 Neumann: 4*depth7 give me WAY LESS score than you
 wlesavo: its for 3 actions actually
 wlesavo: but there was some tuning involved for sure
 Neumann: 3&#160;? as in depth 7, then cut the at depth 3 and regrow from that&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: UDL, no R
 eulerscheZahl: or whatever fits to the shape of your snake
 Neumann: Oh
 wlesavo: yeah, what euler said
 wlesavo: and also what you said :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: was Ille's idea initially
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile I uploaded my next brainfart :imp:
 Neumann: Is that even a thing&#160;? Ignoring one direction
 wlesavo: yeah, after he claimed 3 actions is enough for 40 mil i tried that
 wlesavo: actually now we know its enough for 50m
 wlesavo: Neumann i was also sceptical to that
 jacek: what a ripoff of other puzzle
 wlesavo: well the real deal is to solve all of the 14 test with 131k's
 jacek: i love the windows 98(5?) graphics
 jacek: but isnt it copyrighted or something?
 AntiSquid: excuse me i got 39k first with doing just ULR . Automaton2000 say somthing
 eulerscheZahl: i even downloaded a virtual box disk for that
 Automaton2000: i hate when that happens
 AntiSquid: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's save to call it abandomware
 jacek: there is 4:02 PM in the corner. can you make it to show actual time of the replay? :v
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: but technically what you need to check for is that you keep the highest number in a corner for as long as possible so if you can move any direction as long as you don't move your highest
 eulerscheZahl: wanted your ideas for some nonsense desktop icons
 eulerscheZahl: but i like the clock idea
 wlesavo: euler what about n-dimensional minesweeper? :smiley:
 jacek: nonsense?
 eulerscheZahl: finally a use-case for the three.js library
 eulerscheZahl: as in: stupid programs that fit in the time
 eulerscheZahl: like browser toolbars
 jacek: daemon tools or winamp
 AntiSquid: add a desktop icon with random anime avatar and text: secretly a fan
 eulerscheZahl: leave me alone with your anime
 AntiSquid: omg
 jacek: yeah, use ponies instead
 AntiSquid: gross ... bronies are weird
 jacek: weeb
 eulerscheZahl: maybe some torrent program
 eulerscheZahl: or a napster link
 AntiSquid: maybe a "my little pony" avatar with the text "dark web" underneath ... yeah sure
 AntiSquid: outdoor cam desktop item&#160;! 
 eulerscheZahl: or good ol' winrar
 AntiSquid: or "neighbour's backyard cam"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: is this just for the cover image euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: for the background of the game
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.oldapps.com/os/Windows_98">https://www.oldapps.com/os/Windows_98</a>
 eulerscheZahl: messengers, of course!
 AntiSquid: oh yes limewire&#160;! the first best source of viruses&#160;!
 AntiSquid: mcaffee antivirusinternet explorer 4
 eulerscheZahl: how do i go online and download things? it tries to detect my modem
 jacek: delete system32
 AntiSquid: sure i have a drive with a bunch of system32 on it just so i can delete when whenever i see that comment 
 AntiSquid: delete one *
 jacek: linux hasnt system32 and see how fast it is
 AntiSquid: out of curiosity what do you use jacek? 
 AntiSquid: also windows has bloatware so your comparison is unfair
 jacek: arch linux
 AntiSquid: upgrade to black arch now
 Illedan: Oh, Minesweeper contri :O seems fun
 eulerscheZahl: i still have to fix the system clock. it's stuck :D
 Illedan: OH
 Illedan: Do it in JS?
 Illedan: Would be very cool if you added a dummy start menu to :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: when you load the replay, it already shows the correct time
 eulerscheZahl: that part is done in JS
 Illedan: aha
 jacek: while youre at it, why dont you make fully functional windows 98 in js
 Einwickler: jacek like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://98.js.org/">https://98.js.org/</a>
 Illedan: wow, some people have too much free time
 Einwickler: yep
 Einwickler: there is a ms paint on github somewhere too
 jacek: ohh and it has minesweeper
 jacek: no need for VM now
 Illedan: euler stole it from there :O

 DomiKo: I think that statement is too long
 jacek: you read statements? :o
 DomiKo: no
 DomiKo: but i can see that it is long
 DomiKo: :sweat_smile:
 BiMathAx: Xd
 DomiKo: ohhh that's English + French
 BiMathAx: It's because she is in English/French
 DomiKo: now I don't know if that's legal or not
 jacek: its a crime
 DomiKo: French could be crime
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid did you just self-upvote your comment?
 AntiSquid: it's a good comment
 DomiKo: own comment is always good one
 eulerscheZahl: that would be a good comment if i would have written it DomiKo
 AntiSquid: btw i still remember the order on every machine was: My computer, recycle bin, network
 jacek: what is the round limit in checkers? 300?
 Laminator: isn't it infinite if both sides get kings?
 jacek: on CG
 AntiSquid: it's never infinite, one of the players would die in real life before the game ends .
 Sylarb91: imagine that happening
 Sylarb91: a game from childhood till burrial
 MSmits: Laminator you can have multiple kings in checkers and  if you have more kings than your opponent you will usually win
 MSmits: you do get some extremely long solved wins though. I think  with more than 10 pieces, some solved games have a PV of 400+ turns
 MSmits: so that's the fastest you'll win in those cases
 jacek: i see there is 300 turns limit
 MSmits: yeah, so in CG the solved wins/losses/draws are different
 MSmits: well.. only in the sense that some won games will be draws
 MSmits: all draws will still be draws
 MSmits: this is reflected on the leaderboard btw. Way too many drawn games. 
 MSmits: also because these end games are so long, the searches cant find a route to the win even if it does exist, so you get silly loopa
 MSmits: loops
 MSmits: if someone ever makes a chess game, this will be far worse even. 
 MSmits: needs a point win rule. if you're ahead by x points it's an automatic win. Otherwise way too many games will get stuck even though it's obviously a win for one side
 jacek: nah, in chess it is more complicated
 MSmits: what is
 jacek: points and the endgame
 MSmits: I mean I know the game is more complicated and material isnt everything, but after 300 turns, the game is likely stuck in a loop
 MSmits: you could make it +15 point difference for the win or something
 MSmits: and you dont apply the rule until after 300 turns
 MSmits: in real chess tournaments there is a referee making a decision like this also
 MSmits: well the one i was in when i was young anyway
 PatrickMcGinnisII: start making baby pawns at turn 200, heh
 MSmits: lol wut?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bored pieces make babies
 MSmits: sounds like i've been playing chess wrong
 MSmits: ahhhh
 jacek: thats cheese
 Allis: @MSmits Not necessarily "stuck in a loop", but threefold repetition of the position is very likely to have occurred by move 300.
 MSmits: mmh true
 jacek: dunno. detecting 3-fold repetition would be pain
 PatrickMcGinnisII: drop random glasses of beer, drunk pieces can bend the rules
 Allis: I would be shocked if there weren't a chess position hashing algorithm by now.
 jacek: zobrist eh
 jacek: hmm my checkers bot seems to be working bugless. move representation was pain
 Allis: What'd you use?
 jacek: for now, negamax
 eulerscheZahl: finally, my clock is working
 PatrickMcGinnisII: No Stress Chess would work, no repeated moves checks. level 1, 1 card, level 2 3 cards level 3 5 cards, yup that would do it
 MSmits: jacek yeah... checkers is a pain to simulate with the jumps
 MSmits: oh and eulerscheZahl grats on fixing time. Though without you my vacation would never end&#160;:(
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: sorry, responding to some old chat :P
 MSmits: I had new ideas about oware endgame books
 MSmits: turns out even though you need a different result for each turn because of the limit, they have patterns. So i can save a bunch of time
 MSmits: and I can keep generating the endgame book while still on my opening book
 MSmits: maybe if I use all these new ideas I can finally win some games vs you jacek :P
 MSmits: still only have a 20-30% winrate with my best versions
 jacek: good
 jacek: its boring being the 1st
 MSmits: in a way it is yeah
 jacek: no motivation to improve
 MSmits: I would not mind working on yavalath more, but you're right, no motivation
 MSmits: I'll help you out, just give me another month or two
 boon-cpu: h
 MSmits: I got you
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 jacek: gotta rent that supercomputer eh?
 MSmits: maybe as a last resort :P

 jacek: not that fancy, but yeah
 DomiKo: maybe one day I'll make something work that well
 DomiKo: right now everything is a lot worse or very similiar&#160;:(
 jacek: how can it be worse?
 DomiKo: some enhancement are really slow
 DomiKo: and they perform very bad&#160;:(
 jacek: many of "general" or "knowledge-free" enhancements works mostly only for go, maybe hex/havannah

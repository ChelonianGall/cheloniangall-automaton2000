 FlyHead: :nerd:
 hosseinZK86: hi
 yassirsecurity: hi
 trashcan06:  Servers fixed woohooo!
 yourmomsbutt: hello, has anybody here done kirk's quest?
 uvBoss: yeah
 uvBoss: whatup
 uvBoss: u mean the labirynth?
 yourmomsbutt: no, sorry, I mean The Descent
 uvBoss: i have done it
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent</a>
 uvBoss: this?
 yourmomsbutt: yes
 uvBoss: wait let me catch up on what the puzzle is then i can help&#160;:)
 yourmomsbutt: i'm having trouble understanding the requirements, more precisely the input the game is providing. is that from 0 to 9? or value 0 is 100, value 1 is 85 etc&#160;?
 uvBoss: okay so
 uvBoss: there are 8 "grids"
 uvBoss: the game provides the height of mountain at each grid
 uvBoss: u have to keep record the highest and shoot it
 uvBoss: do u get it?
 uvBoss: @yourmomsbutt
 yourmomsbutt: what do you mean by grid?
 yourmomsbutt: i am trying to solve it in java
 yourmomsbutt: if it makes any difference
 uvBoss: just divisions on the screen which divides the whole thing into 8 parts
 yourmomsbutt: and each of these grids has a different value? grid 0 = 232, grid  1 = 540 etc?
 uvBoss: yea the value is the height of the mountain
 uvBoss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/xvbRESw">https://imgur.com/a/xvbRESw</a>
 yourmomsbutt: aha, ok, that makes more sense now. thank you uvBoss! :raised_hands::v:
 uvBoss: np&#160;;)
 yourmomsbutt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/20e04b8b-0167-4829-82ea-c10cf5a863e3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/20e04b8b-0167-4829-82ea-c10cf5a863e3</a>
 yourmomsbutt: ok, so i had a look at the solution, and they provide the following loop
 yourmomsbutt: won't it basically print the same value over and over again?
 uvBoss: nono
 uvBoss: the updated values will be given every frame
 uvBoss: every iteration of the while loop
 uvBoss: new values will be provided
 uvBoss: @yourmomsbutt
 yourmomsbutt: ohhh so it chooses the highest one each time
 yourmomsbutt: correct, it says "At the start of each game turn, you are given the height of the 8 mountains from left to right."
 yourmomsbutt: thank you!
 uvBoss: np
 MelihEkici: Hi
 MelihEkici: can we choose the difficulty when creating a private room?
 jacek: no
 Thran: It is usual that task are always very easy in private rooms?
 SPDene: Thran if you mean a private clash of code: there's no difficulty rating for clashes, but they're all meant to be solveable in 5 minutes. other than that, it's random which ones you get
 AntiSquid: Thran, what you do in private is none of our business
 Wontonimo: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: joke aside, no, it's random for clash afaik
 Milas44: ye jk jk
 Milas44: ._.
 amin_tabriz: Hi 
 AntiSquid: greetings
 hosseinZK86: InputExpected outputIs HTML a programming language? No.00110? 0.
 abrman: If I have a *.js function with default values, how do I call the function while using default 1st parameter but setting the 2nd one?
 abrman: Ahh, found it: functionName(undefined, "Foo")&#160;:)
 Milas44: html isnt a language
 JohnnyLuke: the l stands for language
 JohnnyLuke: so ...
 magaiti: html is a markup language
 magaiti: not a spoken or programming one
 magaiti: but a language nonetheless
 Hinokami: hola
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: gluten tag from german bread
 jacek: oO
 Trunks123abc: Yo
 geriatric1927: Oo
 MSmits: testing my new bot. I think its early game is still pretty weak, but it makes up for it somewhat in the late game
 MSmits: this replay is interesting
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529196969">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529196969</a>
 MSmits: ply 40 -&gt; my bot knows it lost
 MSmits: ply 43 -&gt; due to opponent mistake it's now a draw
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: That game just hurts my head, I can't even play it myself
 MSmits: haha yeah that's uttt
 MSmits: it's gonna be top 10 at least
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: noice, gl
 MSmits: pretty happy with that because there are no random rollouts
 DJSchaffner: can i remove the notifications for people validating contributions? since i am allowed to do that i feel like it spams a little too much
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: is that game solved the same way normal tic tac toe is?
 MSmits: it's not solved at all
 MSmits: but you can solve it from some point in the game, say ply 30 and up
 MSmits: in that case it's solved similarly yeah
 DJSchaffner: oh nevermind i found the setting for it
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: yeah, i was meaning how tic tac toe the best play for any position is known
 MSmits: ah no, my  bot just continuously tries to solve if it hits endgame positions and some point it succeeds
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: nice job
 eulerscheZahl: hi, who's up for a short quiz?
 MSmits: me
 MSmits: what did i win
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: whats the topic?
 eulerscheZahl: i grouped chat logs by user and generated word clouds
 eulerscheZahl: i give you an image and you guess the user
 jacek: AutomatonNN did you hear that?
 MSmits: thats awesome!
 AutomatonNN: why do you want to participate?
 eulerscheZahl: level 1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/nCkLnvq">https://imgur.com/a/nCkLnvq</a>
 Astrobytes: mk
 MSmits: madknight
 eulerscheZahl: that's even a reasonable answer from Automaton :o
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, MK :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/UXsjlNv">https://imgur.com/a/UXsjlNv</a>
 MSmits: the ezpz did it
 jacek: this could be a puzzle
 reCurse: I was going to say MK but CSB was not taking over the whole picture
 reCurse: I call BS
 Astrobytes: ul jahn?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it's uljahn
 Astrobytes: the ye did it

 Peanutbutter_Warrior: Dunno, but why is D in there
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: D
 eulerscheZahl: it's from&#160;: D
 JohnathanBarbee: D
 reCurse: jacek?
 eulerscheZahl: the tool removes the&#160;:
 eulerscheZahl: not jacek
 eulerscheZahl: jacek pings automaton much more
 jacek: and i dont ping myself
 Astrobytes: me?
 reCurse: Who elses keeps referencing D though
 eulerscheZahl: it's Astrobytes
 reCurse: Oh really
 MSmits: oh Astrobytes is pretty neutral i guess
 MSmits: no weird catchphrases
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/f6WfigC">https://imgur.com/a/f6WfigC</a>
 reCurse: Yeah removing the nick references would make this harder
 jacek: AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by that?
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: D
 eulerscheZahl: not automaton
 ciel617: i do not understand anything you guys talk about lol
 MSmits: darhorse?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 MSmits: mmh
 Astrobytes: struc t?
 eulerscheZahl: hint: the 5th most talkative user within the last 10-11 months
 reCurse: jacek
 eulerscheZahl: db dr
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Astrobytes: ah, he's quite neutral too
 reCurse: 5th most? He's never here

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/wRJ5xBw">https://imgur.com/a/wRJ5xBw</a>
 eulerscheZahl: surprised me too. i'm going by overall text length to say 5th most
 reCurse: With the big euler I would say Automaton
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: that was easy
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: or eulersche and he talks in 3rd person a lot
 Astrobytes: yep

 eulerscheZahl: i blame the python library
 reCurse: Always a good candidate

 reCurse: it's :D
 eulerscheZahl: an extraordinary happy user :D
 struct: antisquid
 Peanutbutter_Warrior: the ds just crack me up for no good reason
 eulerscheZahl: not squid. 2nd most talkative user
 MSmits: this users thinks everything is a game
 Astrobytes: you euler?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: ahhh 
 reCurse: What
 reCurse: I thought you'd be 1st
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: fun quiz
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/eYaCCOE">https://imgur.com/a/eYaCCOE</a>
 MSmits: now we know who is best at listening here
 Astrobytes: Right I gotta run, afk a bit
 eulerscheZahl: smits is chatting more than me
 reCurse: Yeah was fun, thanks for that
 struct: me?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, struct
 Astrobytes: ok that m,ust be struct
 Astrobytes: saw the avx
 MSmits: I am nr1 euler?
 Astrobytes: later
 eulerscheZahl: by text length: yes
 eulerscheZahl: see you
 MSmits: bye Astrobytes
 MSmits: but not by messagecount?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have stats for the latter
 MSmits: so I am long-winded?
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: easy to generate but i don't have it handy
 MSmits: I think  I talk in waves. When I do talk, a lot of walls are incoming. 
 MSmits: I stop when chat is filled with bald old men
 eulerscheZahl: so, any specific user you want to see? i have the 100 most active
 reCurse: I'm not bald. Wait.
 eulerscheZahl: i declare astro as the winner
 MSmits: no it's me
 MSmits: astro easily the winner
 reCurse: You should now use this power for more entertainment and train a chat bot on a specific user
 MSmits: btw reCurse, my new non-rollout bot only ended 10th on submit. does 50% winrate vs you in CG bench, but doesnt really stand out in other ways. Still above nagrarok though
 reCurse: I still fondly remember inoryy's MK bot
 reCurse: Maybe top 5 funny things to happen here
 MSmits: i wasnt there then i think
 reCurse: No that was a long time ago
 eulerscheZahl: how could I miss that MK bot?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 struct: I also missed it
 reCurse: Maybe I have logs buried somewhere
 reCurse: Not sure what to search for though
 MSmits: did it just produce mk catchphrases?
 eulerscheZahl: fix it ezpz
 reCurse: It was scarily hard to distinguish from the real
 eulerscheZahl: write a GA for CSB easy top 10
 reCurse: It kept referencing random CSB replays with bad URLs
 reCurse: Stuff like that
 MSmits: that would be funny yeah
 reCurse: lol I found myself referencing that bot again to you
 reCurse: In 2019
 reCurse: History repeats itself
 eulerscheZahl: i have a bad memory then&#160;:(
 MSmits: there's just too much stuff in there
 Scarfield: in history?
 jacek: maybe it cant avoid draws but at least tries to escape it... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/529194852">https://www.codingame.com/replay/529194852</a>
 MSmits: in his head
 eulerscheZahl: and you are to blame most according to my stats :P
 MSmits: mmh i think you zone out mostly, when i start rambling. I would be surprised if you remembered most of that
 eulerscheZahl: i plead guilty :flushed:
 MSmits: yeah jacek, your bot is trying to figure it out it seems
 MSmits: but those states might be solved as a draw even with infinite time
 MSmits: so you cant solve all draws
 MSmits: i mean make them go away
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: but it worked here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529195682">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529195682</a>
 MSmits: yeah, that one is definitely solved as a win
 reCurse: Oh dear I found
 MSmits: but you could still get stuck in repetition
 reCurse: December 2016, time flies
 reCurse: Not as funny as I remembered though, but still
 jacek: its not perfect but ill take it
 MSmits: this is not a NN jacek?
 jacek: it is
 struct: did you use end game tablebase at all?
 MSmits: it's hard to use them in the bot itself struct because they are huge
 jacek: NN can tells the position's value, and it says its good but if many moves are good it may go round in circles
 jacek: no, i didnt. not in game, nor for training
 reCurse: For the record I ended up ditching them altogether
 reCurse: Was a fun experiment though
 jacek: in learning too?
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: It all ended up worse
 reCurse: And using those is a major pain in the ass
 MSmits: it took too much "space" in the NN, distorting good play in early games?
 reCurse: Like seriously it's a nightmare to use
 MSmits: checkers dbs are complicated
 reCurse: No it's mostly due to how they're made and how to get good data out of it
 jacek: similarly happen to me in bt. for training, i turned off my extended solver and it learned a little bit faster and better
 reCurse: They're obviously made to store as little as possible
 reCurse: But it makes any use outside their intention very complicated
 MSmits: do you mean how they compress invalid states and such?
 reCurse: Mostly because of this requirement: a position must not have a capturable piece if either side was to play the next move
 reCurse: And they provide absolutely nothing to validate
 reCurse: Took me hours to get something decent out
 reCurse: And it was computationally very expensive
 MSmits: oh right, because when you capture, the branching is small, you need to finish the capturing, then do the lookups
 reCurse: Yes, except
 reCurse: If *EITHER* side
 reCurse: You can end up searching to depth 40 and still not know the answer
 reCurse: Unless you do very smart prioritization
 MSmits: mmh why 40? Capture chains dont go that deep do they?
 reCurse: No but you can't just do minimax
 reCurse: Because there will always be sequences of moves that alternate possible captures for the other side
 MSmits: isnt that quiescence search?
 reCurse: And even checking for repeated positions don't help
 reCurse: No I repeat
 reCurse: For either side
 pabx06: clash of code keep asking if i am a bot wtf&#160;?
 JLukeSkywalker: you are too speedy
 JLukeSkywalker: or cookies
 struct: is to prevent you from becoming addicted
 MSmits: i dont follow exactly reCurse, but that's ok,I'm sure I would run into the same issue if i try it and i'll remember what you said
 JLukeSkywalker: you in incognito mode or something?
 reCurse: It's not just a capture for the side to play
 reCurse: It's also a capture if it so happened that same board would be the other side to play
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: Quiescence is only for captures that make sense in that game, i.e. the side to move
 reCurse: But both sides makes this madness
 MSmits: I see
 reCurse: Oh and I forgot another important detail
 MSmits: when I do a endgame db everything is always done from the perspective of the player to move
 reCurse: It keeps only information for one of the sides
 reCurse: There is no precise way to know other than query
 reCurse: So you have half the info
 reCurse: Plus those invalid states
 reCurse: It's extremely expensive to compute the exact information
 reCurse: It's more made as a lookup in your current search
 reCurse: If you don't have the info, oh well
 reCurse: But if you look to train... bah
 MSmits: so it's not usable in a rollout either?
 MSmits: say at the end of a mcts rollout where your pieces go &lt; 8
 reCurse: It works in the context of a search if I could attach a 40gb tablebase to my bot
 reCurse: It doesn't work as well in the context of a NN that tries to train against it
 MSmits: because games take too long?
 MSmits: or wait, because of the reward check
 MSmits: backpropagation
 MSmits: you need to look up 
 MSmits: a lot
 reCurse: Well there's a bunch of reasons
 MSmits: you check if the NN does the move that comes out of the DB i suppose
 reCurse: First it slows down everything with becoming IO bound
 MSmits: does *a* move
 reCurse: Second you don't have correct information a lot of the time
 reCurse: Third if I directly rely on the db during training I need a replacement at runtime
 reCurse: To have a replacement at runtime I need the correct way to solve a game
 reCurse: The correct way to solve a game is not something that dbs are made to answer efficiently
 MSmits: heh, i think if you wanted to do a foray into retrograde analysis, you might have started with an easier game even
 reCurse: I have zero interest in this, for now at least
 reCurse: I found other ways to deal with endgames
 MSmits: ahh ok
 iiAbusinq: what are good beginner coding practice exercises 
 JLukeSkywalker: pretty much any coding golf problem
 JLukeSkywalker: you can link to the actuall puzzle from the golf screen
 Scarfield: I dont see the benefit of code golf for a beginner though?
 JLukeSkywalker: do the non-golf puzzle
 jacek: the puzzles are easy, golfield
 Scarfield: oh, makes sense
 JLukeSkywalker: you can actually solve it in the golf too
 JLukeSkywalker: just might not do well ranking-wise
 MSmits: i did that
 Scarfield: i missed your second message there&#160;:) NNcek
 Scarfield: iiAbusinq so either what luke jaywalker suggested or take a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a> 
 iiAbusinq: Thanks all!!
 reCurse: Suggesting golfing to a beginner? Is this trolling?
 iiAbusinq: What even is golfing? haha
 MSmits: they mean that the golfing puzzles are also the easy puzzles
 reCurse: I need to learn how to read
 MSmits: i suggest thor, temperatures and batman to my students
 reCurse: My bad
 struct: Just do CG official Easy puzzles
 reCurse: Or stop reading chat while multitasking
 struct: thor temperatures descent horse racing 
 Scarfield: golfing means solving with the shortest possible script, ie. fewest characters used.
 JLukeSkywalker: i just suggested it because i think those puzzles other than maybe dont panic are some of the easiest easy puzzles, and good to start with
 JLukeSkywalker: you can ignore the golf part
 JLukeSkywalker: solving it in the golf no matter what code length you end up with isnt detrimental at all
 reCurse: Seems a roundabout way to go
 reCurse: But sure
 JLukeSkywalker: instead of linking a bunch of puzzles, its easier to just say 'go do the golf puzzles'
 struct: Only if CG had a way to filter by success rate
 reCurse: Keeping community puzzles separate would have been a start
 reCurse: Instead it was made a stop
 reCurse: On the plus side it dramatically reduced the number of chuck norris questions in chat
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 JLukeSkywalker: for gold csb, does the winning pod have to pass through all checkpoints?
 JLukeSkywalker: or can you do like a staggered divide and conquer
 JLukeSkywalker: like each pod does every other
 Scarfield: each pod has to do the race itself
 Scarfield: each pod has to pass each CP to be more clear
 JLukeSkywalker: got it
 JLukeSkywalker: makes sense
 Scarfield: could be an interesting puzzle though, to time and intertwine crossing the CPs with different pods
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i was kind of hoping thats what it was
 JLukeSkywalker: both are cool though, just different strategies
 Scarfield: you are free to make your bot work that way xD
 iiAbusinq: Should all test cases be done with the same code?
 JLukeSkywalker: yes
 Scarfield: yes
 JLukeSkywalker: when you submit it tests everything
 Scarfield: bah, too slow
 iiAbusinq: Is it possible to add a second condition (if then)
 JLukeSkywalker: yes
 iiAbusinq: Do I just add it?
 JLukeSkywalker: as long as your code is valid code, codingame should accept it
 JLukeSkywalker: with some like version exceptions, etc
 iiAbusinq: Musn't be valid then haha
 JLukeSkywalker: want to share?
 JLukeSkywalker: can paste here, big stuff will auto pastebin
 iiAbusinq: I'm trying the Mars Lander Episode 2
 iiAbusinq: Not that big, just trying to start out
 iiAbusinq: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03e9ee8d-7903-4569-af58-3407d676ba35">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/03e9ee8d-7903-4569-af58-3407d676ba35</a>
 iiAbusinq: I'm just trying to solve the first test case, I don't understand 
 JLukeSkywalker: looks like the if-elses there arent stacked/indented correctly
 iiAbusinq: I added the else for a second time as it said I didn't provide an input in due time, but that didnt fixx it
 iiAbusinq: Where should I use else in this case?
 JLukeSkywalker: let me try to learn lua if-elses real quick
 JLukeSkywalker: unless someone on here knows already
 iiAbusinq: Thanks!&#160;:)
 JLukeSkywalker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be575b02-2028-4851-944f-ec2d0bb08e3f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/be575b02-2028-4851-944f-ec2d0bb08e3f</a>
 JLukeSkywalker: first indent was off from paste
 JLukeSkywalker: but looks like lua if-elses should be stacked like this
 iiAbusinq: Ah okay, thanks I'll try it again
 iiAbusinq: It works, thanks!
 iiAbusinq: Didn't know elseif existed
 JLukeSkywalker: np, gl!
 JLukeSkywalker: now i know how it works too&#160;:)

 -oa-: Man, the mars lander crashing is loud! Rip earbuds
 MSmits: there's a solution for that
 MSmits: :rocket:
 Wontonimo: Hey @MSmits, thank for the UTTT help.  Made it to Legend
 MSmits: gj Wontonimo
 JLukeSkywalker: gz!
 MSmits: i stopped working on my non-random uttt bot with eval. I got into top 10 with it and it did well vs anyone in top 10 except karli so and toma toes, but in the end it was weaker overall. I am now trying to merge new stuff i learned with my old bot
 jacek: is the log still bottleneck?
 Wontonimo: mine is (nearly) random.  Just the same square heuristic for opening isn't random
 MSmits: ah, I did not have a rollout at all. I expanded a node, then evaluated the node, assigning  a score and backpropagating that
 jacek: evaluation uttt? oO
 MSmits: yeah, it beat your bot :P
 MSmits: it's up now if you want to test it
 Wontonimo: that's what my python imp did.  it worked better than my random python but still was stuck in low silver
 Wontonimo: tbo, my eval was probably too simple, just placement count
 MSmits: more than that jacek, i had versions that beat re curse... but it's likely RPS, most did roughly 50% vs him
 MSmits: overall it just did too badly in early game, losing games it shouldn't, to weaker players
 MSmits: and it never beat toma toes or kar liso
 MSmits: Wontonimo, my eval is centered on calculating the likely hood of winning miniboards, to maximize both the total count of won boards and the probability of getting a line
 Uljahn: so the score is float?
 Imdone: Hello guys
 MSmits: it is currently, i was planning on converting it to a 16 bit integer for speed
 Imdone: i need help with algos
 Imdone: i have a number
 Imdone: i have list*
 MSmits: a list of algos?
 Imdone: and i need to find number which have least sum of differences with elements from list
 Imdone: something like that [-3, 2, -4] -&gt; -3
 MSmits: are you doing a clash?
 Imdone: [0, 2] -&gt; 1
 Imdone: nope puzzle
 MSmits: loop it
 Imdone: i have solution but it takes too long
 Imdone: what is fastest (optimized) way to find it?
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: hmm
 Wontonimo: what's the puzzle?
 MSmits: i can see the problem. If you have a large list, the naive solution is N^2
 Saad-py: whats the puzzle
 Imdone: netwprk cabling
 Imdone: network*
 Saad-py: ok
 Uljahn: ah
 MSmits: Imdone numbers are between what and whay?
 MSmits: what are the limits?
 MSmits: also are they unique?
 MSmits: better link the puzzle
 Saad-py: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/network-cabling">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/network-cabling</a>
 Wontonimo: @Imdone are you familiar with binary search&#160;?
 MSmits: oh i solved that
 Imdone: -230 ≤ x ≤ 230
 Imdone: -2**30 &lt;=x &lt;= 2 ** 30
 Wontonimo: 2^30
 MSmits: I used a quicksort
 Imdone: 0 &lt; N ≤ 100000
 MSmits: make sure you have a fast sorting method 
 Imdone: @Wontonimo i guess
 MSmits: i am trying to understand my own solution :P
 jacek: i am dumb... i put othello to my new training pipeline. basically copy pasted code from bt and checkers
 Wontonimo: haha ... i was going t osay the same
 jacek: it stopped at 30% winrate. i forgot about passing moves
 jacek: it propagated bad values
 MSmits: ahh 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: those are annoying
 MSmits: Imdone somehow i used a median value
 MSmits: if you sort the values
 MSmits: and then take the median. I think it's optima?
 MSmits: optimal
 Wontonimo: @Imdone , step back and take a look at the whole problem and try and come up with ways to reduce the problem.  For example, you know that the cable can't be above the highest house, or below the lowest house
 Astrobytes: Take a look at the test cases and work through it on paper
 Astrobytes: (or whiteboard, whatever)
 MSmits: it's really a small solution, i tend to be very verbose in my old C# solutions, but this one is, aside from the weird house struct i did just to contain x and y and the quicksort, it's just 20 lines

 jacek: and yes, within 10 minutes it surpassed my half-day bot :v
 MSmits: nice
 jacek: you hilighted struct?
 MSmits: it's not my fault he named himself that :p
 Imdone: submitted median, worked out, thx for help
 struct: You should use class
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: ah but then it would not be immutable
 jacek: or java. no structs threr
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: C# structs arent immutable
 MSmits: i always think that somehow
 jacek: c# doesnt have final, sealed or whatever classes?
 Wontonimo: @Imdone , the quicksort works because errors are proportional to the distance to the solution.
 MSmits: not sure jacek
 MSmits: euler would know
 jacek: AutomatonNN ping him
 AutomatonNN: hey guys i want to paste it in the beginning on this site and it works pretty well
 MSmits: Imdone good to hear it worked, i was kinda surprised too as i remember
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/all-about-c-sharp-immutable-classes2/">https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/all-about-c-sharp-immutable-classes2/</a>
 jacek: hmm it seems you have do it your own - use read only properties
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: my VS is always telling me to make everything read only 
 MSmits: it's so whiney
 jacek: why dont you listen
 MSmits: i probably should
 jacek: or is this your wife's name
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: no, I am not married to VS
 MSmits: but I think i might be cheating on her with VS :P
 MSmits: spend far too much time with it
 Astrobytes: wooo 1st in Clobber
 jacek: because im not there yet
 Astrobytes: I'm ahead of tric
 MSmits: good job!
 MSmits: you're on a roll today. First you speed-analyze everyone's speach patterns and then you wrecked the tric
 Wontonimo: any word on if clobber is going to be 8x8 or 10x10&#160;?
 MSmits: will be a while until we know
 MSmits: i think basically if there is no need for 10x10 it will be 8x8
 Astrobytes: lol yeah
 jonzel: brillant how batman paces like a mf from one bomb to another in this batman puzzle
 Astrobytes: Will be 8x8 Wontonimo
 jacek: depends if hardcore players will solve 8x8 withing CG constraints
 Astrobytes: Just waiting on a boss from darkhorse now
 MSmits: solving seems impossible unless there are mathematical rules you can derive that eliminate a lot of possible moves
 Wontonimo: could just mess with everyone and make the board size variable and stated at startup ... 5&lt;N&lt;15  lol
 MSmits: there have been games that did that
 MSmits: especially contest games
 jonzel: how to a prevent this "hard coded solution"flag at the end of a puzzle
 Astrobytes: Wouldn't be an issue, just trickier to bitboard
 jonzel: i always seem to get some false positives there
 jacek: huh?
 jacek: what flag
 MSmits: new to me as well
 jonzel: this message "The validators differ from the puzzle test cases to prevent hard coded solutions. This is why you can have some fails here even if all of the tests provided in the IDE have been successfully passed.
 MSmits: good message, this is true
 jonzel: this comes up after submitting a solution
 jacek: it always shows that if you fail some puzzles
 Astrobytes: It just means if you didn't pass them all, that's the reason why
 jacek: or your code sucks
 jonzel: but I dont fail any and I dont have any hard coded solutions
 jacek: so you passed all the validation tests?
 jacek: maybe you forgot some edge cases
 Wontonimo: you definitely missed an edge case
 Astrobytes: It's not insinuating you've hardcoded anything, it's just explaining that the validators differ from the testcases, like jacek says you have probably missed an edge case.
 jonzel: I think so. "Play all testcases" is all green
 Astrobytes: Yes but what about when you submitted? 
 jonzel: Wait a sec
 Astrobytes: Only the validator results matter on submission.
 jonzel: I see&#160;:-D one test fails now. Thanks for clearing that up for me
 Astrobytes: No worries.
 finncode2010: hoi
 finncode2010: im new
 reCurse: I have a terminology problem if it rings a bell to anyone familiar with graph theory so I know what to google...
 reCurse: So you have a graph with some nodes forming a single component. You are allowed to create new edges between any 2 nodes, but each new edge should give the best minimal sum of distances of any node to any other node.
 finncode2010: wat
 reCurse: In other words, if you have A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E, you should either create A-&gt;C or C-&gt;E
 finncode2010: wat
 reCurse: Is there any term or algorithm for that
 finncode2010: is happen
 Astrobytes: Check with euler for a fast answer, he's on discord
 finncode2010: hello
 finncode2010:&#160;?
 MSmits: ye euler is most likely to know this
 Astrobytes: finncode2010: we heard you the first time.
 MSmits: if i even knew an algorithm that did this it's unlikely i would know the name =/
 nvc-_: yoo
 reCurse: The hardest part of research is figuring out the terminology to google&#160;:/
 iiAbusinq: Is it possible to work together on a code on this site 
 MSmits: true
 nvc-_: y is this so hard
 jacek: well i did many graphs algorithms not knowing their name
 MSmits: iiAbusinq you could share an ide outside CG and paste the solution here
 reCurse: My bad the graph is not directed by the way
 MSmits: but you're not supposed to share solutions on two accounts
 MSmits: at least not in any competitive way
 MSmits: simple practice puzzles are ok i think
 iiAbusinq: What's  a good  online code editor which more than one person is able to use?
 MSmits: repl.it, but if you're not paying, it's public
 MSmits: this is if you dont want to get involved with gith, which is of course more professional
 MSmits: repli.it i nice for short python scripts 
 MSmits: repl.it i mean
 reCurse: Oh I think I figured it out
 reCurse: Thanks rubber CG
 MSmits: :duck:
 jacek: what is it
 Astrobytes: don't leave us hanging!
 finncode2010: hi
 jacek: is it: dissapointment? 5%?
 MSmits: oh, is he working on tryangle?
 MSmits: make sure to channel the disappointment reCurse
 finncode2010: what is happening
 reCurse: I think it's any node with distance 2 that has the greatest number of reachable nodes that don't involve distance 1
 reCurse: But I can't prove it I'm not mathematician
 reCurse: :P
 MSmits: you can't prove it to us, but your brain neurons proved it to eachother
 finncode2010: btw recurse is a cool name
 struct: Does Prim's algorithm work?
 struct: Or is it for something else?
 reCurse: Oh no I'm wrong actually, forget it
 reCurse: Hmm maybe struct, need to read more, thanks for the hint
 Astrobytes: Yeah, aren't you trying to find minimum spanning trees?
 reCurse: Well it might be slightly different
 reCurse: In my problem, the optimal is a graph connecting any node to any other node
 reCurse: So all distances are 1
 reCurse: The idea is to find an algorithm that would minimize the sum of distances by using few new edges
 reCurse: So a balance between number of edges and overall distance
 reCurse: Makes sense?
 struct: So you want to make it the shortest possible using the fewest edges possible?
 reCurse: In other words, the minimum spanning tree is not optimal
 reCurse: I could keep adding edges
 reCurse: Well I think I can get something good by finding which new edge would give the best result in a greedy fashion
 reCurse: So take the new edge which has the lowest sum of all distances
 reCurse: Until some criteria is met
 JLukeSkywalker: does anyone have a good strategy guide for code vs zombies? I can pass all the tests, but the score is meh
 struct: random
 Astrobytes: that seems sensible reCurse, until you can get a better answer from euler
 reCurse: It just seems wasteful and the kind of problem probably already studied in some fashion
 MSmits: JLukeSkywalker I used a monte carlo to get top 300 or so, then cheesed my way to (i guess) top 20 or 30, dunno what it's at now
 MSmits: with optims, most of the time the validators are known and you can solve them by hand with some optimization tools to speed things up
 MSmits: i guess maybe people used GA and/or SA combined with manual to do this or some smart MC
 RSBat: ga = genetic algorithmsa = simulated annealing?
 MSmits: yes
 iiAbusinq: How does one use the same code to solve all text cases?
 MSmits: it needs to be flexible enough for that
 Wontonimo: ^
 Astrobytes: Solve the general problem not the individual tests.
 Scarfield: ^
 Scarfield: AstroWise
 MSmits: ^^
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: CaretField
 JLukeSkywalker: cg fudge is such a terrible puzzle for color blind people
 Astrobytes: *funge - and yes it's a nightmare.
 Astrobytes: I moaned but euler told me to make a PR if I was that bothered :D
 Scarfield: google told me you didnt call me a carrot xD 
 Astrobytes: No but the wordplay was intended&#160;;)
 Scarfield: im not a carrot&#160;:'(
 MSmits: dont cry
 MSmits: have a :carrot:
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Nope. Just a field of ^s
 MSmits: mmh I am compressing the uttt top 20
 JLukeSkywalker: my cg funge is a field of ^
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: pulling high ranked down and pushing lower up
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: gonna stop submitting or Vingte will pass re curse :p
 jacek: i dont mind some pushing in oware as well
 MSmits: already pushed him beyond tomatoes
 MSmits: ow, lemme try a submit
 MSmits: oware IDE loads soooo slow
 Astrobytes: Not just oware
 MSmits: no i know, is there something they can do to fix this?
 MSmits: all i want is a simple place to dump text
 Astrobytes: Donno. It's been extra slow since last weekend loading-wise
 MSmits: I see
 struct: try opening it with chat disabled
 struct: ?disableChat
 MSmits: but then i will miss you
 Astrobytes: awww
 struct: I dont know where all the lag comes from
 MSmits: i am guessing euler is taxing the server with his big data project
 MSmits: trying to understand our speech patterns
 MSmits: and such
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: at least it explained his absense
 Astrobytes: *absence
 Astrobytes: Bet he's doing lots of ML stuff to get up to speed
 jacek: hes making his own chat. with blackjack and hookers
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: ohh thats it
 MSmits: he's creating replacements of us
 MSmits: copies
 Astrobytes: Replicants!
 MSmits: so that he can chat with us even at 6 am when the normal people are asleep
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Scarfield: lol
 RSBat: sometimes i wish i used rust instead of c++
 Scarfield: 25h 20m untill mars landing :o
 RSBat: too much unexpected behavior in c++
 Explosion-Scratch: hi people
 Scarfield: hey
 jonzel: Like what expected behaviour in cpp? I am learning for an upcoming cpp exam
 RSBat: the one i just encountered wasint a = static_cast&lt;const Foo&gt;(foo).bcall copy constructor of Foo
 MSmits: lot's of foo
 jacek: you were supposed to push me up :F
 MSmits: sorry, if you look at Robo's matches, all of them are with me as player 2
 MSmits: I win 100% as player 1 :P
 MSmits: bad luck
 MSmits: at least you have the same rank right
 jacek: ok booker
 MSmits: :P
 JLukeSkywalker: funge hurts my head
 MSmits: it's fudge
 MSmits: eat healthier
 JLukeSkywalker: got it to do 1-3

 jacek: good for brain
 jacek: as you  can see
 Astrobytes: (he eats hay and fresh grass)
 MSmits: sure
 reCurse: Summing up all those articles and studies seems to indicate eating food is bad for you.
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inedia</a> is the only way
 JohnathanBarbee: It
 jacek: and cheap
 Wontonimo: 100% of people who eat food eventually die
 JohnathanBarbee: ^
 Wontonimo: fun fact: you can go without food for the rest of your life
 reCurse: Breatharians? I'm perplexed if I'm better or worse for knowing about that.
 jacek: you never know until you try it
 reCurse: It's like discovering a new uncharted parcel of land in the continent of madness.
 struct: Why did I google it :rolling_eyes:
 reCurse: That was in the article
 jacek: no need for google, i linked it
 struct: ah I didnt open the article
 jacek: you dont open my links?&#160;:&lt;
 reCurse: Wouldn't blame him
 Astrobytes: "a new uncharted parcel of land in the continent of madness." - amazing.
 struct: Is there any research why some people think like this?
 Wontonimo: USA
 Wontonimo: it's a whole country
 Wontonimo: j/k
 Astrobytes: Ancient Hindu texts are not always good to live by
 jacek: i cant hear you over my third eye
 Astrobytes: :P
 reCurse: Can't hear about it if the proponents are dead
 Wontonimo: if the third eye is in the middle of the forehead, where is the third ear?
 jacek: inner ear?
 JohnathanBarbee: armpit
 Astrobytes: Behind your front-ear?
 reCurse: Fascinating, it's true you only hear about an extra eye but not an extra nose or ear
 struct: Riots happening on barcelona and madrid&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: i don't have a "minds ear".  Can't imagine noises
 Astrobytes: My 7th nose is tingling...
 jacek: Wontonimo you have aphantasia? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia</a>
 Valdez001: hello
 Scarfield: why stop with food and water only, seems obvious to stop breathing as well. especially from the term "breatharianism "
 Wontonimo: yes, audio and visual
 jacek: i cant imagine having aphantasia
 Wontonimo: @jacek but I do have a spacial sense, like visual, but it contains only concepts.  There is no colour or texture
 reCurse: So after the dark corners of youtube, the dark corners of wikipedia with your explorer in chief, jacek
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: haha i can't imagine not
 jacek: would you explore my youtube recommendations?
 reCurse: No.
 Astrobytes: Definitely not.
 jacek:&#160;:(
 struct: cat videos?
 jacek: cats, dragon ball, mlp, obscure music
 Astrobytes: I can do cats in moderation and obscure music. That is all.
 struct: I thought mlp standed for Machine Learning P...
 reCurse: multi-layer perceptron
 Scarfield: problems?
 jacek: multilayer perceptron. with friendship extension
 Astrobytes: "multi layer perceptrons"

 Astrobytes: It is. See the 'friendship extension"
 jacek: stop horsing around

 Astrobytes: You tell yourself this.
 Scarfield: xD
 BlaiseEbuth: Bronies never die.
 jacek:  /)
 Astrobytes: ...
 MSmits: hold your horses.... another brony?
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh MSmits&#160;! You're here, but when&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i have no horses, and i'm certainly not holding some brony's horses
 MSmits: eh always?
 jacek: sounded like entrance to heisenberg joke
 Astrobytes: Oh you missed it. Blame special relativity.
 Astrobytes: And superchat theory.
 Scarfield: maybe he came back from the future, and want to know when now is
 MSmits: mmh I guess i missed it then yeah
 MSmits: i do too little physics this year
 MSmits: I'm slippin'
 BlaiseEbuth: What's the spin of MSmits when he sleep&#160;?
 Astrobytes: It needs to be measured...
 MSmits: 1/sqrt(2) * up + 1/sqrt(2) * down&#160;?
 Wontonimo: and if he sleeps quietly enough, does his instances obey the poly exclusion principle anymore
 Scarfield: relative to what? and in what units [MSmits/day]
 Astrobytes: *Pauli 
 jacek: poly?
 Scarfield: pony?
 MSmits: I'm not a fermion
 Astrobytes: Enough HorseField!
 Wontonimo: yes, pauli ... 
 Wontonimo: yes, the ponyexclusion 
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: a Brony Einstein Concentrate
 MSmits: good one&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: condensate i think but sure
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: Joke still valid.
 MSmits: agreed
 Astrobytes: (imo)
 MSmits: hey Astrobytes, remember when we did oware and we tried EPT depth 5 and experimented with different depths
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: i am doing that with UTTT now, see if it does anything
 MSmits: before this i only tried straight eval or full rollout
 Astrobytes: Well, when we took that to its conclusion it ended up depth 0
 MSmits: sure, but in the papers they use other values, so who knows, maybe there is something to it
 MSmits: worth a shot. I tried longer shots already
 Astrobytes: Worth a shot I guess, you might discover something
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: especially eval-wise would be interesting
 MSmits: well I know my eval is reasonably good, but it doesnt beat the top 10
 MSmits: matches 5-10 or so
 Astrobytes: Not bad though
 struct: But your eval beats NN eval?
 MSmits: not exactly, some versions of my bot had 55% vs re curse
 MSmits: but it's highly RPS-ed I think
 jacek: if your eval is reliable then 0 depth is enough
 Skynse: The frontend of this site feels like it was made with javascript
 Astrobytes: You're gonna be in for another few months of fitting params
 MSmits: nah, it's just the one parameter for depth, the eval itself only has 2 parameters
 MSmits: so 3 total
 jacek: you can grid search that easily
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: No other heuristics to use in eval?
 Wontonimo: @Skynse - what else could it be and how would if feel different if it was?
 MSmits: no, it's basically like this
 MSmits: the two parameters control two parts of the eval
 MSmits: the part that counts expected miniboards won
 MSmits: and the part that counts how much your best line of 3 counts
 MSmits: the line of 3 you're farthest along with
 Astrobytes: Yeah I getcha
 Skynse: @Wontonimo - I've just been getting a hunch that javascript is used for the server side operations. For instance, I feel like Django would be more static, but I could be wrong
 Skynse: Then again, I haven't used frontend js frameworks in conjunction with django before
 Astrobytes: Well, let me know how you get on with tweaking the depth
 Skynse: I want to make a startup but can't decide on whether to use django, vue.js, or both
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 MSmits: yeah, as i said, it's a long shot. If you don't hear anything, it was a bust, like so much else with uttt&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, gotta explore the options right
 MSmits: yep
 Scarfield: when is your UTTT paper due?
 MSmits: ehh not sure, i do have other papers i should be working on :P
 jacek: :soccer:
 MSmits: have to write an introduction to a design/research paper for my studies
 Astrobytes: Do it on Oware or something
 MSmits: no it's supposed to be for high school education
 MSmits: i am doing it for my AI course
 Scarfield: lol nice one paperCek
 MSmits: probably on optimization and Q-learning
 Astrobytes: Ah ok 
 MSmits: basically travelling salesman and that 3x3 breakthroug game i forgot the name of
 jacek: hexapawn?
 MSmits: yeah that
 jacek: but you already did it
 MSmits: yeah i cheated a bit
 jacek: and despite the name, there are no hexes there
 MSmits: now i have to properly design it using didactic literature and all that
 Astrobytes: I think the hex may refer to the fact it is 3x3 pawns...
 Skynse: @Wontonimo I just re-read what I wrote earlier, and now I can see how it didn't make any sense lol 
 MSmits: there's 6 pawns
 MSmits: i also did an octapawn self-training game
 Astrobytes: +3 is what I meant
 MSmits: trains itself by q-learning in 1 minute
 Astrobytes: 3x3 grid, 3+3 pawns
 Astrobytes: nice
 jacek: table :unamused:
 Wontonimo: have you tried sarsa @MSmits&#160;?
 jacek: or salsa
 Wontonimo: sure, that too, i'm curious about both now
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/python/c673de5c0f?outputOnly=true&amp;runOption=run">https://trinket.io/python/c673de5c0f?outputOnly=true&amp;runOption=run</a>
 Scarfield: Wontonimo just type a nickname to ping, no need for @.. also there is autocomplete for names: sca-&gt; tab
 MSmits: it's solved as a win for human player, so you can still win once it's  done training
 Wontonimo: AH!  thanks Scarfield 
 Scarfield: np&#160;:) 
 Scarfield: but remember pinging is a great power, and with great power and so on
 Wontonimo: Scarfield 
 jacek: right AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a framework to be able to check the language to say "solved"
 MSmits: are you trying to cheat again AutomatonNN&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: give it his game to something interesting :P
 Astrobytes: Huh. It almost made sense twice in a row.
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Broken clock
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 Astrobytes: Hm. When analogue clocks die out that phrase will go the same way as the 'broken record' phrase.
 MSmits: into a nursing home?
 Astrobytes: Just a minute inside your mind would be a very strange experience.
 reCurse: To die out they need a cheaper alternative
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: well i wouldn't know, I am always in here
 MSmits: to me it's normal
 Astrobytes: 2 * Yeah, true. 
 Scarfield: i wonder how much of that minute in your mind is taken up by uttt :thinking_
 MSmits: mmh ok, so good news the EPT with depth gets better when I let it go deeper. Bad news, thats because when it goes deeper it does more rollouts and my rollout bot is better :P
 MSmits: nice timing Scarfield
 Astrobytes: Right. Not much point in that then.
 Astrobytes: lol, EcksDee on point tonight
 Scarfield: I wonder how big "xD" would be on those pictures euler made earlier
 MSmits: he has you too i think
 MSmits: he said 100 most talkative players
 MSmits: I estimate you at 19
 Scarfield: lol
 Scarfield: thats a very specific estimate
 MSmits: well i stopped short of decimals
 MSmits: that would look weird
 Astrobytes: Highly specific for sure
 MSmits: they were pretty hard to guess most of them
 Astrobytes: I still can't believe how accurately and quickly I got those
 Scarfield: i hope he doesnt have a value/word estimate
 MSmits: except jacek 
 jacek: :F
 MSmits: are you doing :F now to have more variety in your next word pic jacek&gt;
 jacek: eenope
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: Scarfield what is a value/word estimate?
 Scarfield: like how worthwhile / word ones messages are to read
 Angecide: anyone have had any experience with mcts with rave statistics? basically using moves played during rollout to generate better statistics for moves when expanding and searching
 Angecide: I was wondering if this could have positive effect in uttt
 jacek: personally i never got rave to working
 jacek: but i doubt it would work in uttt
 MSmits: i know of rave, but it requires parallel games having similarity. In uttt, you jump to a completely different board on every move
 jacek: moves are restricted and dependent on position
 MSmits: so one different move, screws up your RAVE thingy
 reCurse: It doesn't have raving reviews
 Angecide: I see, yeah it probably makes more sense in games like go where there aren't any jumps
 MSmits: could make sense in breakthrough
 MSmits: not in othello 
 MSmits: might make sense in yavalath also
 Astrobytes: "raving reviews" :door:
 MSmits: it makes sense in games where the killer heuristic also works in minimax
 Scarfield: yea he is on fire today xD
 MSmits: correct me if i am wrong, but killer move in minimax is what rave is to mcts, kinda, sort of?
 jacek: somewhat
 MSmits: except killer move is probably more effective
 MSmits: and less damaging when it fails, as it's just a move ordering thing and not  a move value thing
 Scarfield: uuh never heard of killer move, have pretty much decided on Minmax, and was considering how to sort moves earlier&#160;:)
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: killer move is when you save for each depth level a best moveindex
 MSmits: and use that move first, even on different boards
 Astrobytes: you can also use history heuristic
 Scarfield: yea looked it up, and found a short and neat explanation
 Astrobytes: Scarfield:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf">https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf</a>
 Scarfield: have only done minmax once before, so i pretty much only know about ab pruning
 Astrobytes: More in depth stuff online but that's a good start.
 MSmits: I usually do negamax + AB + TT + history. I don't get more creative than that
 Scarfield: uuh ty astro, but i will probably save that for after finishing my first attempt
 MSmits: it's the only source i find that has a good example for combining AB with TT
 MSmits: that's not a trivial thing
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's quite clear
 Scarfield: have been thinking about doing TT as well, but it seems problematic with 3fold repetition and 50 move rule in the 960 chess
 Astrobytes: There's that ancient website too
 Astrobytes: I don't have the url handy
 MSmits: Scarfield, you're right, the repetition is painful
 MSmits: but it's painful even without TT
 MSmits: because to have the full state, you need to basically know all prior states
 Scarfield: i think i have an idea that will work fine without the TT, but my assumptions usually turn on me xD
 MSmits: yup
 Wontonimo: hey MSmits , I'm curious if you use Q-learning specifically or if you use SARSA or some other variant 
 MSmits: it's meant for education, so it's the simplest form of Q-learning. Just a table with action/state combinations
 MSmits: just to expose students to simple machine learning
 MSmits: they play the game by hand also, with actual pawns
 Wontonimo: cool
 MSmits: to see how a human learns
 jacek: sounded like you teach robots
 Astrobytes: nice
 MSmits: lol jacek
 Scarfield: "And slowly the fleshy vessel realises its mistake"
 MSmits: :grin:
 Scarfield: well im off, gn all&#160;:)
 MSmits: gn Scarfield
 Wontonimo: gn

 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, pretty much set it up that way instead of doing a full interpreter
 MSmits: oh wait, that was actually supposed to be asm-like?
 JLukeSkywalker: each one of those is a call to a function that modifies the stack
 JLukeSkywalker: so yes?
 MSmits: I se
 MSmits: e
 JLukeSkywalker: @outdef app(a):	global stack	stack += [a]
 JLukeSkywalker: like that one is the append
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: this optim does seem like torture
 JLukeSkywalker: defenitely
 JLukeSkywalker: pretty sure my solution is gonna time out on the 9991 test case
 JLukeSkywalker: maybe not
 JLukeSkywalker: i think my print decorator for testing is just making it absurdly slow
 MSmits: could be
 elderlybeginner: Do you remember any post about scoring data structure for a bot or a contest?
 MSmits: not me
 elderlybeginner: some basic information how to set a scoring for a bot
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: I think you mean an evaluation of a sim state?
 elderlybeginner: yes, that's what I mean
 MSmits: well it depends a lot on the game, but basically, it's a lot of trial and erorr
 MSmits: what makes the most sense is that you try to figure out what features of the gamestate tell you the probability of a win
 MSmits: collect a bunch of features
 MSmits: give them parameters
 MSmits: add up the features multiplied by their parameters
 MSmits: and there's the score
 MSmits: a useless feature will have a parameter that goes to zero when fitting
 MSmits: can you give an example of a game, then i can tell you what features to evaluate (maybe)
 elderlybeginner: I wonder what data structure to use. There are some parameters, some side effects
 MSmits: i'm not sure what the data structure has to do with it
 MSmits: evaluation is a function that returns a number
 elderlybeginner: I am trying to rewrite my if/else for codebusters into some evaluation and it doesn't look clear
 elderlybeginner: no sim here, just heuristics
 MSmits: oh ok, i'm not really the right person to ask about aesthetics, code readability and reusability
 elderlybeginner: I miss a separate file for variables and with functions it's getting kind of messy
 MSmits: with a good IDE, you can collapse stuff so it's not so cluttered
 Astrobytes: There are some code bundling scripts, or you could write your own if you want to separate things into files for readability
 Astrobytes: You can collapse stuff in CG IDE also I think
 MSmits: yeah
 elderlybeginner: thanks guys, I will look into that
 Astrobytes: You're using python right? It'll be easy to find or make a script for that for sure.
 RanDom2113: hey so I just started today, what program language should I start with?
 elderlybeginner: yes, python, right now i wondering how to nicely pack: actions (stun, move, bust, release, etc) with features and multipliers for each feature
 elderlybeginner: @RanDom2113 that's seems to be really tricky question :joy:
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: MSmits: yay I'm back in Oware top 10. Not that it matters much below top 5 but hey :P
 MSmits: that's pretty good though. 
 Astrobytes: 8th
 MSmits: there's 4 nns you can ignore
 MSmits: i mean it's not a level playing field with them
 Astrobytes: Just trying to pull darkhorse down :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I kinda ignore the nn's, can't compete currently
 MSmits: can ignore me too, I have a book based on 9 million games :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah, well, y'know :P
 MSmits: biggest before this, was 3 million actually
 MSmits: so it's pretty extreme
 Astrobytes: Can't really just award myself a feelgood 3rd :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah you really went in hard on Oware
 MSmits: it's because of the NNs
 Astrobytes: I know. It became a mission
 MSmits: yep 
 MSmits: i stopped hardcountering them, just running a general book now, that works too. Cant hurt
 MSmits: the previous stuff is still in there though, but they can just submit a new version and the hardcounter advantage will be gone
 Astrobytes: Well the general book is about as NN-like as you're gonna get really
 MSmits: without doing a NN yeah, it's at least a way to "train"  locally, even if it's just for the start of the game
 MSmits: the start can go quite deep with a branching of only 5 o rso
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: how is your Clobber boss?
 darkhorse64: It's my next weekend project
 Astrobytes: cool
 darkhorse64: so not started yet
 Astrobytes: All good, no rush
 darkhorse64: I'll wait for 269 upvote, I want to beat trolls and castles
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 darkhorse64: Only 260 eft
 darkhorse64: left
 MSmits: #lifegoals
 Astrobytes: btw, my *deliberate* oware submit tonight got 8th darkhorse64 - finally I'm chasing you again.
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 MSmits: gj Astrobytes
 darkhorse64: Yes, the safety margin has decreased
 Astrobytes: I'm more pleased about getting above tric twice in a day tbh
 MSmits: tric is  a great benchmark
 Astrobytes: You know that
 MSmits: i dont mean because he is the best player, even though sometimes he is, at least for a while
 Astrobytes: He's not unleashed everything in clobber yet though
 darkhorse64: twice. What's the other multi&#160;?
 MSmits: but because he is so stable
 Astrobytes: Just Clobber darkhorse64, I'm first
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, exactly
 darkhorse64: I now understand why you want a new muti
 Astrobytes: I still need to bitboard clobber though
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: what else would you do
 MSmits: it's a board with white and black pieces
 Astrobytes: I wrote my bot in 2 hours
 MSmits: it would be harder for me not to bitboard it
 Astrobytes: With hardly any sleep, and a hangover
 MSmits: then i would need to think about classes and whatnot
 Astrobytes: On Sunday
 MSmits: yeye :clap: :P
 Astrobytes: classes, meh
 Astrobytes: You can check the chat logs
 MSmits: no I believe you
 Astrobytes: I didn't wanna risk doing bit operations with a humdinger of a hangover
 MSmits: sometimes you get inspired. I usually take days, but my connect 4 bot was a few hrs and got a good one right away
 Astrobytes: I really need to get on amazons, and test jrk e's multi, and there are others too
 MSmits: so many
 Astrobytes: anyway, won't take long to bitboard clobber, it's simple
 darkhorse64: Play fireworks. I enjoy my lead but we are too few
 MSmits: seems to be
 Astrobytes: Yes darkhorse64! That too
 Astrobytes: I think that's a candidate for is it mu-zero? that they used that on?
 darkhorse64: I don't think I can AVX move gen because I need left shift and right shift
 darkhorse64: Clobber move gen
 MSmits: you can combine left and up 
 MSmits: and do down and right separately
 darkhorse64: Yeah, but it's only two at a time, with C4, I do all checks in one go
 Astrobytes: Yeah (re Fireworks/Hanabi) MuZero
 MSmits: you can run two sims at once&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: I don't think it'll be a bottleneck
 Butanium: Hey I'm doing the fall Challenge 2020 and I have a problem&#160;: sometimes my script take to long to explore the graph so I loose because of that. I tried to implement a len limit for the exploration but it's not sufficient when I have a lot of spell to deal with. Is there a way to get how many time I have left during the prgm in order to interrupt the tree search if I have not enough time left?
 darkhorse64: The more rollouts the better
 MSmits: Butanium yes
 darkhorse64: C++ -&gt; chrono
 Astrobytes: I was considering EPT on it but I might stick with alphabeta, we'll see
 MSmits: easiest is a global variable for "timeleft"
 MSmits: if it's false, you quit out of any recursive function your bot is in
 MSmits: every time you enter a new function you increment an iterator. Every 100 or so iterations you  check the time
 Astrobytes: Just make sure you backed up your best move so far
 Butanium: But how do I know how many time I have for each iteration?
 MSmits: you dont need to
 MSmits: you only need to know the start time
 MSmits: and the current time
 MSmits: when you pass a certain limit you set, you quit out of any function you're in
 Butanium: ok
 Astrobytes: start your timer at the beginning of each turn, if it exceeds the limit you bail
 MSmits: say you get 100 ms, you quit at 95 ms
 Butanium: it says I have 50 ms per turn
 Astrobytes: yep, so bail out at 45
 Butanium: it's pretty short :sweat_smile:
 Astrobytes: Optimise&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah but it's short for everyone
 darkhorse64: EPT, vanilla MCTS, solver à la d&amp;b, may be ml, many approaches
 MSmits: clobberTime!
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed. I like Clobber in that respect, I think it will be interesting.
 MSmits: I'm imagining a fantasy-style orc when i say that, just fyi
 darkhorse64: For the fall challenge, I don't even use all available time because a beam search depth 15 is enough
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: got your D&amp;D head on
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: I don't think Clobber will bea successful multi but I believe it's interesting for ferocious competitors
 Butanium: darkhorse64 &gt; I'm dohing BFS for now
 Astrobytes: damn, I also still have to do Blocking
 Astrobytes: yes exactly darkhorse64 :P
 Butanium: that's why it takes that long
 Astrobytes: beamsearch is definitely the way to go for that challenge iirc
 darkhorse64: Yeah BFS takes too long and does not get deep enough
 darkhorse64: Top Gold with a BFS, Legend with BS at least for me
 Butanium: I'll try to implement a BS
 Butanium: thanks for your advice&#160;!
 darkhorse64: BS is a BFS where you keep only the best moves at each turn
 Astrobytes: n best moves
 Astrobytes: n being the beam width
 darkhorse64: Selecting the best moves is the difficult part
 Butanium: yes
 Butanium: Idk how to select them actually
 MSmits: evaluate them and sort them by score
 darkhorse64: The post mortems are full of evaluatiion ideas
 Butanium: you mean the potions or the spells by score?
 MSmits: you dont actually have to know whats best. You just create a sum of features with parameters and then experiment 
 MSmits: then you will learn what works
 Butanium: yes I see x)
 Butanium: Also I had a question
 Butanium: For the coders strike back challenge
 Butanium: I went to legend
 Butanium: but are you supposed to do reinforcement learning when you reach it?
 MSmits: gj
 Butanium: thx ^^
 MSmits: not really
 MSmits: unless you want to be top 5
 Astrobytes: well done. What's your rank?
 Butanium: 673
 Butanium: I didn't change my gold league code
 MSmits: so 668 more ranks to get before ML is needed
 Astrobytes: And your algo?
 Butanium: my algo is just 1 pod reaching the checkpoints and another trying to annoy the enemy team
 Butanium: but I struggled with improving my aiming system for the annoying boy
 MSmits: ah, then you'll hit a wall Butanium. The better bots in legend all use a search
 Butanium: so I kinda give up 
 Astrobytes: no search algorithm then? You could get further even with just a random search.
 MSmits: if you want, check one of my games. My pods say how many simulations are being run
 MSmits: select me as opponent
 Butanium: what do you mean by search algorithm
 MSmits: trying moves up to 7 turns into the future and simulating the outcomne
 MSmits: assuming best play from opponent, preferably
 Astrobytes: Like your BFS, just searching the game tree
 MSmits: CSB is not the best place to learn how to do a search
 Astrobytes: That's always a relative one
 MSmits: better learn it for simple boardgames, then learn how to apply it to CSB imho
 MSmits: CSB has simultaneous moves
 MSmits: 4 agents
 MSmits: continuous action space
 DomiKo: physics
 MSmits: and that
 Butanium: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529286299">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/529286299</a>
 Butanium: lul
 Butanium: I actually have a search algorithm which just check if I will collide next turn
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: i  blocked you and you timed out?
 Astrobytes: Right, so you need to simulate a few more turns ahead
 Astrobytes: No he didn't make the checkpoint MSmits
 Astrobytes: So pod timeout, not search
 MSmits: yeah because of the blocker
 Butanium: yes it's my nightmare
 Astrobytes: That's the job of a blocker no?&#160;:)
 MSmits: imagine the top 5 blocking even better&#160;:)
 Butanium: x)
 Astrobytes: You've seen the info about CSB? The magu s article, the referees?
 Butanium: nop
 Astrobytes: One referee:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Coders%20Strike%20Back/Referee.java">https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Coders%20Strike%20Back/Referee.java</a>
 Astrobytes: Another referee:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/robostac/coders-strike-back-referee/blob/master/csbref.go">https://github.com/robostac/coders-strike-back-referee/blob/master/csbref.go</a>
 Butanium: oh yes
 Butanium: that's the things to simulate outside of codingame
 MSmits: but you can use it to simulate inside the game
 Astrobytes: No - inside too.
 Butanium: lol
 Butanium: ok
 MSmits: translate the code to something you can use inside your bot
 Astrobytes: FR version of Magu s article:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb.html</a>
 MSmits: but honestly, try your first search on a simple game, unless you really realyl like csb and it motivates you 
 MSmits: a full search csb bot will be 600-1000 lines
 Butanium: yes I think that if I do some more coders strike back I'll do it whith an heuristic method
 MSmits: brb
 Butanium: Like genetics algorithm
 MSmits: good idea
 Astrobytes: Genetic algorithm can work sure, even just random search with some mutations can work too.
 Butanium: Random search would be to test random action and see what's the best result within 8 ticks?
 Astrobytes: within n ticks yep
 Butanium: ok
 Butanium: But for now I don't have time to do such a big project like this. So I'll just try to make my witch not timing out because it allows me to practice on my school programming langage ocaml
 Astrobytes: Oh OCaml, lucky you :D
 Butanium: do you have any other funny bot fighting challenge to recommend me?
 Astrobytes: That's cool though, school stuff comes first
 Butanium: Yes ocaml is pretty cool
 Astrobytes: Just depends what you like. There are a few physics games but they're quite complex
 Astrobytes: Many board games
 Butanium: I didn't like the spring 2020 one
 Butanium: too much agent to deal with
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I didn't like that one either
 Butanium: what would be your 2 best recommandation, 1 of physics challenge and another one more like a board game?
 reCurse: physics: fantastic bits board: wondev woman
 Astrobytes: FB easier than CSB?
 reCurse: I didn't see any mention of easy in the question
 darkhorse64: physics: poker chip race
 DomiKo: wondev woman is really great for trying minmax
 Astrobytes: Oh my bad
 darkhorse64: because the sim is easier to write compared to FB
 Astrobytes: Is it?
 reCurse: FB is 100x easier to write a heuristic for
 reCurse: Just saying
 Astrobytes: ^
 Butanium: ok thanks
 Butanium: when I'll get time I'll give a try to those challenge
 Astrobytes: I really need to get up to speed on here.
 darkhorse64: I agree for the heuristics part
 Astrobytes: Anyway, an omurice and a beer beckons me. Goodnight all
 Butanium: cya
 reCurse: "I won't submit just to drag you down" "Submits 20 times the next day" :P
 reCurse: Just teasing btw
 MSmits: yeah, i know.. i honestly do not have a single bot version that does better vs karliso than vs you
 MSmits: I tried full rollout, EPT dept 5,10,15,20 with eval, full eval, many different ways to prune
 MSmits: all better vs you than karliso
 reCurse: It's ok I'm getting used to the trope of anyone else but me getting boosted in most multis :p
 MSmits: hehe ok
 reCurse: Wish I was kidding
 MSmits: maybe your bots are too specialized at beating strong players
 MSmits: compared to others anyway
 reCurse: I think you could make an argument just as well for the other way around
 MSmits: depends on who's submitting
 MSmits: in uttt it's usually the weaker players
 reCurse: Wouldn't a bot too specialized more likely to be boosted
 MSmits: if you're specialized to beat karliso and he never submits, then that would not be good
 MSmits: you benchmarked vs top 5 or so didnt you?
 reCurse: Top 10
 MSmits: ah ok
 reCurse: A bot who performs very well in a specific scenario is more likely to be hit by someone weak against it
 reCurse: vs a generalized bot
 reCurse: IMO
 reCurse: So if anything maybe my bot is too generic
 MSmits: hmm could be true I guess. But karliso must also be. Everything i try against him fails
 MSmits: and against everyone else i had versions that worked
 MSmits: though not against all at the same time ofc
 MSmits: there is plenty of RPS with a non-random bot
 reCurse: Most uttt bots use random in some fashion what are you talking about
 MSmits: I mean my non-random bot version
 MSmits: if i use it, i get serious RPS effects
 reCurse: Wouldn't you get RPS only if both bots are deterministic
 MSmits: you would think so, but one is apparently enough for it to become noticable
 MSmits: the best "random" bots arent that random in uttt anyway, at least karliso's isnt
 reCurse: Biased random is still random
 MSmits: yeah, what i mean is, the tree of good moves is muc hsmaller than the full tree
 MSmits: and better bots are better at finding those
 MSmits: therefore becoming more deterministic i suppose
 MSmits: anyways, with the eval-only bot i had situations where i had mealc at 30% and yurko at 70% when their bots are equally strong
 MSmits: not to mention you at 55% when you wreck my normal random bot
 MSmits: even though my eval bot is weaker overall
 MSmits: it's pretty annoying when your bot is so unreliable
 MSmits: mine i mean
 MSmits: so i am back to random, keeping my new solver, because solving is cool
 MSmits: (though it does nothing for my winrate)
 karliso: ironic. I remember I asked you about RPS effect when I was starting and you said it is negligible and I should just brutaltest.&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: thats what i thought back then
 karliso: I think to gain consistency you need to do what others do, just better.
 MSmits: mmh in uttt thats probably true
 MSmits: i've seen so much rps in games where NN's dominate and minimax bots 
 MSmits: it's really different
 karliso: I felt same in onitama.. like my minimax would beat mcts, but not win as well against mcts as someother mcts.
 MSmits: yeah onitama can be like that
 MSmits: when the oware nn's were a bit weaker, i could fit maybe 8 param for my eval. Some would cause me to beat robo 70% lose 30% to recurse and i would change a param by 0,01 and it would be the other way aroudn
 MSmits: the nn's do this to eachother also i believe
 MSmits: recurse is right when he says you need to generalize, but if you generalize and you always play the same move in the same situation then you're still deterministic and a different player that has a lucky set of params that beats this, can pull you down by chain submit
 MSmits: that player could have an otherwise bad bot, not even worthy of top 10
 reCurse: That's a symptom of CG's broken system, not a specific kind of bot
 MSmits: if by broken you mean there's a way to be targeted by the same player over and over then you're correct
 MSmits: however, any time you're pitting two players against eachother, letting them play repeated games, says very little about which is the stronger bot
 reCurse: Broken as in if you tried to fit an elo curve around its multi rankings it would be pretty bad most of the time
 MSmits: i think the problem is that two bots playing repeated games, covers a very very tiny portion of the total gamespace
 MSmits: and to call a bot good, you want to say it knows what to do with most gamestates
 MSmits: (that are likely to occur)
 reCurse: You're treating of a different problem
 MSmits: it's related though
 reCurse: I'm strictly talking about the mapping of pairwise winrates to CG scoreboard
 reCurse: That is garbage
 reCurse: The other issue of trying to test a bot in generic conditions is orthogonal
 MSmits: it might be garbage, but i think it's a smaller problem than the fact that most bots are deterministic and playing games with deterministic starts
 reCurse: I strongly disagree
 reCurse: It happens just as much with games with random maps
 MSmits: you'll get different games every time then though
 reCurse: The submit bias is the single strongest skew factor
 reCurse: Of them all
 MSmits: oh, i agree with that
 MSmits: i thought you were saying something about elo
 MSmits: and score
 MSmits: in any case, this is not even a 5% problem, but a &lt; 1% problem. Who cares about it except us who fight over the first few spots on each leaderboard
 MSmits: if you're not in top 10, you're not likely to worry abot this
 MSmits: I can see why you would though
 MSmits:  I would too, if i wasnt having so much fun otherwise
 reCurse: I need that stupid carrot to put the work
 MSmits: you need to work out how to use a different carrot
 reCurse: But that's where the tough competition is
 reCurse: I wouldn't give a rat's ass about uttt if it had 20 bad bots
 MSmits: I share you way of looking at this but it's not 100%, part of the fun is the game itself. That's what allows me to ignore the shortcomings of CG more easily
 MSmits: i can spend days on a game with 20 players if it's sufficiently interesting to me
 reCurse: *bad players
 reCurse: Not much fun beating your own bot
 MSmits: well lets just say if trictrac, dbdr and such are there, it's fine with me. Just  afew that are seriously competing
 reCurse: That's why I emphasized
 MSmits: no, i do agree with that. you need some competition
 MSmits: I also think you and I are different about letting go of a game 
 MSmits: I cant let go of a game until i try every idea
 MSmits: you cant let go of  agame until you're nr 1
 jtsimmons: This site is really struggling the last week.
 MSmits: it is
 reCurse: It struggles at this time of the day every day
 reCurse: For about uh, 30 more minutes? I forgot
 MSmits: think so yeah
 reCurse: MSmits: If a game is solved as a draw and your bot is the only one strong enough to do so, how should it play?
 reCurse: Just had that random thought
 MSmits: oh you mean the bot solved it?
 MSmits: if you used mcts solver to solve it, it's easy
 MSmits: you pick the move that had the highest winrate
 reCurse: No I meant in a broader sense
 reCurse: Ok let me rephrase
 reCurse: Your bot somehow has the entire table of all game states but the initial state is solved as a draw
 reCurse: How should it play
 MSmits: hmm, well you would want to maximize the chance of your opponent making a mistake
 reCurse: Right, so how do you determine that
 MSmits: maybe do a search and calculate the fraction of moves that are mistakes, encountered in each branch
 MSmits: pick the highest one
 MSmits: make the path of the draw as narrow as possible
 reCurse: But the narrow path could be very obvious
 reCurse: Say in chess where you need to take the piece back for a trade
 reCurse: You could have 30 other moves, all bad
 reCurse: Narrowness is not enough to describe that
 MSmits: thats true, this is similar to the friction between minimax and mcts
 MSmits: mcts will do better where my argument applies
 reCurse: There's something irritating me with that notion
 reCurse: Not sure what
 MSmits: what i just said? Might be phrased poorly
 reCurse: Well with this situation in general
 reCurse: Your bot could be much stronger but much weaker for it
 MSmits: well I encountered a similar issue when doing the bookfight with oldjohn
 MSmits: we were hitting draws
 MSmits: and i could go off on a different branch he hadnt explored yet
 MSmits: hard to decide what to do
 MSmits: stopped being interesting at that point
 reCurse: I don't see the similarity
 MSmits: well you know whatever you do, it's a draw
 MSmits: so you purposely try to find weird branches that are narrow and hard to find for the opponent
 reCurse: That's true for bots of "equal" strength which you could argue is the case for bots booking like that
 reCurse: But I'm exaggerating the notion of a stronger bot by putting it as having the entire game state known
 reCurse: But it's a draw
 reCurse: You should be able to exploit all other players still
 reCurse: But how
 MSmits: ahh ok
 omer123321: It's fun to watch you guys even though I don't understand a word
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i had this when trying to get out of wood 2 in D&amp;B, i solved the full game on turn 1 as a loss
 MSmits: wasnt a draw, but still, everything was a loss
 MSmits: so what to do then?
 reCurse: Yeah, true
 MSmits: you can get out of wood 2 with like 5 lines of code and i wrote a 500 line bot that failed 2 submits
 reCurse: Though I'm not sure there's enough space to help draw parallels
 MSmits: yeah, well it may depend  on the game
 MSmits: what route is best
 reCurse: Assume chess is solved as a draw, what do you play
 MSmits: either you do the move counting thing i mentioned, or some kind of eval
 reCurse: It really bothers me for some reason
 reCurse: You should be able to win every game still
 reCurse: But how do you even determine that
 MSmits: you have to know what the opponent values and you dont
 MSmits: if you know what he values, you know what he is likely to play and which mistakes he is likely to make
 MadKnight: yea that's true automaton2000
 Automaton2000: do you know the one
 reCurse: Is there a generic way to evaluate the probability of a blunder
 MadKnight: since i'm not a mod i can't even tab Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: can you share your code please?
 MSmits: well say you could fit a very good NN 
 MSmits: and you find the moves that are most likely to be picked by this NN but are mistakes
 MSmits: i think that every version of this NN might give different results though
 MSmits: also the calc time used during the game 
 MSmits: and other limiting factors
 MSmits: i wonder if your problem has a name already
 reCurse: Well it's probably some sort of game theory exploitation
 MSmits: i remember jacek training a NN to beat a TTT bot and doing better than his perfect playing minimax bot
 MadKnight: seen YT of a "game theorists" recently
 MSmits: vs random bots
 MadKnight: he explains game maths pretty well
 MSmits: my point about jaceks experiment is that the NN and minimax bot both played perfectly, but the NN was able to exploit some feature about random bots to win more often
 karliso: MSmits You wanted to balance uttt. One day I watched video of Anish Giri and he was asked about his reputaton of drawing a lot of games... and he said something like.. if you don't like draws don't play chess, play tac tac toe
 reCurse: Yeah I got that
 reCurse: I'm just thinking
 reCurse: It's definitely possible that knowing too much makes you play weaker
 MSmits: karliso was his point that chess has more draws?
 MSmits: reCurse you migth be right 
 MSmits: it takes a similar, but stronger bot to properly predict and make use of opponents weaknesses... maybe
 MadKnight: recurs had that exact expeirence in the witches game i think
 MadKnight: and now he be like "i think it might be possible"
 MSmits: ohhh, that explains why I am not nr 1 in most of those multis, too much knowledge&#160;:)
 MadKnight: true
 MadKnight: stop knowing too much
 MadKnight: become like Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it is funny to we have country name same as animal
 karliso: Most top chess games are draws.. players have various styles in chess, some take more risks some are more defensive. And decisive score is more interesting for spectators.
 FdevM: there is four days that i'm stuck in temperatures challenge
 MadKnight: i solved it in 1 line
 MSmits: ah I see
 karliso: I found it curious that he said TTT, because it is draw... maybe he though UTTT
 MSmits: I think he meant it that way
 reCurse: I think he may have meant it as a joke
 karliso: yeah :D
 MadKnight: or he's new
 MSmits: when people play TTT they actually often dont draw
 reCurse: As in, yes, chess is more drawish than a solved draw game, deal with it
 MadKnight: wait
 MadKnight: FdevM or kar
 MSmits: because most people dont know how to avoid losing as p2 in TTT
 MadKnight: oooh ok
 MadKnight: my bad
 reCurse: I think anyone over 8 knows how not to lose in ttt
 MSmits: you would think so, but then you dont play it for 10 yrs and you first 2  or 3 games you lose again :0
 reCurse: Please read between the lines :p
 MSmits: heh yes, but it's actually true, i did this in my class
 MSmits: students were supposed to invent heuristics to always win
 MSmits: and that included playing
 MSmits: they made tons and tons of mistakes
 MSmits: to always draw i mean
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 stop losing
 Automaton2000: so do i just have to start over
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's make multiple people to have 100% winrate
 Automaton2000: the only way to do it, but i am getting an error message
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's say it's possible for multiple people to have 100% against each other
 Automaton2000: can anyone help me with the chuck norris puzzle
 MSmits: you know what bothers me about TTT reCurse, it's similar to your problem maybe. I am inclined to say player 1 has a massive advantage
 MSmits: but 
 MSmits: it's solved as a draw
 FdevM: actually i'm not joking
 MSmits: so is it true then?
 MadKnight: FdevM yea it was my mistake
 MadKnight: don't worry
 MadKnight: FdevM just explain what's your problem
 reCurse: TTT is too simple to be helpful here I think
 reCurse: Like I said anyone that spends a bit of time in the game knows
 MSmits: maybe
 MSmits: true
 FdevM: i already did it in my other account, but i don't remember hiw to solveit
 MadKnight: hmmmmmmm
 MadKnight: sooo
 MadKnight: what u want from u
 MadKnight: s
 reCurse: My brain hurts
 reCurse: We assume playing for the longest loss is the best strategy when you know it's solved
 reCurse: But is it
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 let's keep talking in parallel
 MadKnight: with other people
 Automaton2000: you know your code is readable
 reCurse: It's a parallel to the what to play on a draw
 MSmits: hmm define longest loss though
 MSmits: when using mcts i define it as requiring the most visits to sovle
 MSmits: thats not necessarily the deepest lost
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 i should just listen to recurse
 reCurse: You know, what is proven to take the most turns to lose
 MSmits: loss
 Automaton2000: and it's definitely not unique to cg and you definitely need audio/video. zoom works great.
 MSmits: i think my way is better then
 reCurse: Can you stop spamming automaton when a conversation is happening please?
 reCurse: Thanks
 MSmits: requiring most visits to prove as loss
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 recurs is probably right about anything more than me let's just listen to him
 Automaton2000: one of the top 10
 MSmits: with my new uttt solver, this is how i pick moves, and against &lt; top 20 players i often see games where i lose, that i still draw because they make a mistake
 reCurse: That seems rather anecdotal though
 MadKnight: ooops
 MadKnight: okay
 MSmits: it is, but how else would i d o it?
 reCurse: That's what I'm hurting to know
 MSmits: i think there might just not be a 1 size fits all answer
 MSmits: in uttt for example, there are many critical moves to avoid, to make sure you dont lose on the next turn or the turn after that
 MSmits: those are easy decisions
 MSmits: but for deeper stuff it depends on what the opponent "sees" 
 MSmits: what does he choose to explore and what might he miss
 MSmits: you can only assume your opponent thinks as you do
 MSmits: and then needing the most visits makes the most sense to me
 MSmits: and generally i think that might also often be the deepest, or near the deepest games
 reCurse: But is there a way to define generically what is more likely to be obvious
 reCurse: And use that as a metric
 MSmits: generically i can only refer to the PNS thing
 reCurse: Or is it really all about meta-gaming and it's about constantly adapting to general trends
 MSmits: you read that right?
 reCurse: Yeah
 MadKnight: guys i think u might have differences in how u understand what's it about
 MSmits: thats the general solution i guess, at least it shows which move is hardest to solve
 MSmits: its free of domain knowledge
 MSmits: my uttt solver certainly isnt
 MSmits: anyway, I am getting some sleep.
 reCurse: gn
 MadKnight: gn guys
 MSmits: gn
 MadKnight: now i can spam Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if they are still on the same round, the nth zombie killed's worth is multiplied by the given thrust value. ...
 MadKnight: meh Automaton2000 is only fun in #fr when he spams "oui" or in "ru" when he spams that his smiley icons are broke
 MadKnight: n
 Automaton2000: i dont know much about it, but i have a choice
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 any content at all? in #world? for the sake of the content?
 Automaton2000: i mean, if you have an idea
 Camden272: hey guys
 MadKnight: hihi
 Camden272: how are you
 Camden272:&#160;?
 MadKnight: too good
 MadKnight: can't be good
 MadKnight: well y'know
 MadKnight: anyway
 MadKnight: what are u working on&#160;?
 Camden272: can you help me a little
 Camden272: im really new
 MadKnight: finally
 Camden272: what?
 MadKnight: yea get to your question
 MadKnight: well y'know
 MadKnight: i've been here for 5 years
 Camden272: ohh
 Camden272: well then
 MadKnight: i just guesssed that u'd need help
 Camden272: so what are the basics
 MadKnight: of what
 Camden272: that are easy to explain
 MadKnight: of what
 Camden272: like im tryna do java
 MadKnight: cringe
 MadKnight: do c# instead
 MadKnight: c# is like java + cool features
 MadKnight: java is soooo 2003
 Camden272: ohh
 Camden272: lol
 MadKnight: java was super popular in 2003
 Camden272: ohh
 MadKnight: literally everyone decided to make their projects in java
 MadKnight: and literally every single teaching thingy says that java=good
 MadKnight: but that's 2003
 Camden272: is java and java script the same thing?
 MadKnight: NO
 MadKnight: don't even think about that
 MadKnight: they're not even close
 MadKnight: absolutely 2 different things
 MadKnight: a and b
 MadKnight: u can say they're both in english so that's what makes them similar
 MadKnight: anyway
 MadKnight: so why u wanna do java&#160;?
 Camden272: idk
 MadKnight: thats' the news from 2003 dude
 Camden272: dream does it so i decided i wanna try it
 MadKnight: c# resolved all the problems
 MadKnight: wat
 Camden272: is c# easier
 MadKnight: since when does dream do java
 Camden272: on his dream sd
 Camden272: xd
 Camden272: channel
 MadKnight: dream does cool YT vids and also does stream that they think are "too lucky" so 100% false
 Camden272: he said
 MadKnight: where
 MadKnight: gimme link
 MadKnight: i'll watch and comment
 Camden272: bet
 RSBat: you need java to hack minecraft so...
 MadKnight: welllll
 MadKnight: their "super luck" was related to his whole stream of a ton of plays
 MadKnight: and not just to a single play
 MadKnight: single play was just a tiny bit lucky
 Camden272: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHKcQ184aa8&amp;t=97s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHKcQ184aa8&amp;t=97s</a>
 MadKnight: dude they literally calculated that "terrible chance" based on his 3h stream that contained a ton of separate plays
 MadKnight: his "world record" would just contain a tiny bit of luck
 MadKnight: if u exclude other plays
 MadKnight: why would he run a 3h stream that makes his "cheat" overly visible? 
 MadKnight: directly
 Camden272: he deleted the "did dream fake his speedrun" video
 MadKnight: wat
 MadKnight: there are lots of those
 MadKnight: from different sources
 MadKnight: cmon it's dream
 Camden272: dreams video
 Camden272: from dream\
 MadKnight: i don't believe he wouldn't thought that playing TONS of games on a broken version makes it obvious
 MadKnight: the "terrible chance" is related to a WHOLE 3h stream
 MadKnight: not just to a play
 MadKnight: it contains a ton of plays
 MadKnight: they say - "in his whole 3h stream he had kinda fancy chances...."
 MadKnight: he could just submit a single play
 MadKnight: and it wouldn't make anyone being sus of him
 MadKnight: because it's just "kinda not exactly like that..."
 MadKnight: Camden272 he deleted it after he tweeted the reason
 MadKnight: Camden272 he wanted to stop this whole fight 
 Camden272: ohh well then i dont have twitter
 MadKnight: i saw it on YT from someone else
 MadKnight: i can give u the link
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VczZCoZ21jk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VczZCoZ21jk</a>

 Westicles: Man, these guys are petty
 Camden272: ALRIGHT '
 Camden272: ima go
 Camden272: bye
 truewulfey: man, when you see the same people go on code clash thing over and over throughout the day
 truewulfey: like bro "AlkhilJohn" youve been here for 16 hours straight
 Westicles: that bro is a bot
 truewulfey: i stg then like 90% of the clash people are bots
 DhevanSafaHevanafa: bots don't usually submit answers tho
 mitfity: bot leaves when 4+ people joins the clash

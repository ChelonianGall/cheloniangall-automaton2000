 heaven7: After 3 days of baging head to the wall with binary search I figured out that my program receives wrong instructions in Shadows of the King Episode 1. Anybody else had similar experiance?
 Husoski: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Husoski has taken 2 :taco:s off the floor and now has 9.  There are 0 left
 Husoski: heaven7 Did you mean "Shadows of the Knight"?
 Nik05: Shadow of the King is an easy puzzle, no binary search
 Nik05: Oh wait, it is 
 Nik05: heaven7 it works for me
 Husoski: @heaven7: I just tested my Python solution (straightforward 2D binary search) and it still passes all test cases.  
 Nik05: Did the same in C#
 Husoski: Funny how math works in any language, huh?
 Nik05: Oh right, all languages work with stdin/out, so tests are probably all the same. That is different on that other website, where tests are written in a language's test framework
 Husoski: I meant the kind of math that says repeated integer division by 2 must reach 1 when the starting number is greater than 1.
 heaven7: I'm using Rust, and targeting the test 6 (UP/DOWN). Since I can enable debug, I know where is the "bomb". Now, my algorithm works properly if I implement the logic of going up/down. But when I switch to instructions from the game, at one point, game gives wrong instructions.
 heaven7: Check this debug output: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c377d7a3-6db1-4863-b84b-de42051a691d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c377d7a3-6db1-4863-b84b-de42051a691d</a>
 heaven7: Maybe I should switch to Python as well. Could it be an issue with instructions provided to the Rust in the background?
 jacek: should work the same for all langs
 Nik05: Husoski well yes :P 
 heaven7: that's the idea... :D
 heaven7: Let' me try to implement the solution in Python (for example).
 heaven7: Will let you know how it goes... :D
 Nik05: Are you sure your rust implementation is correct?&#160;;)
 Husoski: heaven7 What's your strategy with "UR" and "DL" inputs?
 heaven7: I can post it... It's very simple...
 Husoski: ...etc.
 Husoski: I was going to change my logic and try to duplicate it.
 Husoski: There's no rule that says a puzzle can't have a corner-case error...
 heaven7: Ok... here goes the unfinished code (ugly), but should give you idea... 
 heaven7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/670b4e08-43aa-40ad-9931-5c88eac18ce0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/670b4e08-43aa-40ad-9931-5c88eac18ce0</a>
 heaven7: I'm targeting the test 4, as lef-right instructions work well....
 Nik05: Uh
 Nik05: Those bottom two if blocks are kind of empty...
 heaven7: They are... I'm targeting the test 4.
 Nik05: Oh 4 is 1D
 heaven7: Yep.
 heaven7: I made initially the version that should be working with all instructions (directions), but then the "batman" went bizarre... :D I taught it's the algorithm issue, and went back to the drawing board.
 heaven7: This is really a basic problem, that's why I'm so confused.
 heaven7: But will try this in python...
 heaven7: It should work.
 Nik05: Well yes, you are missing stuff
 jacek: if it doesnt, try space maze
 Husoski: Your left/right code is empty, so I don't know how you say you're getting a wrong direction.
 heaven7: Try to run test 4 with that code.
 Nik05: heaven7 try running cargo check/clippy and it will show you all unused variables...
 heaven7: With python version, I'm getting the same issue. Must be a 'problem with the user'.
 Nik05: It is indeed 
 Husoski: It looks to me as if you're doing things in the wrong order.  
 heaven7: Python code is simpler...
 heaven7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0b6f249-9000-4017-9097-cd65b394cdb3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0b6f249-9000-4017-9097-cd65b394cdb3</a>
 Husoski: The response you get tells you where the bomb is relative to your current location, so you update your high/low boundaries based on that.  The midpoint is only for your next guess.
 heaven7: This is the 'numeric' simulation... 
 heaven7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/456b754e-a7c6-4425-9946-f03ceeb6203a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/456b754e-a7c6-4425-9946-f03ceeb6203a</a>
 Husoski: heaven7 read the above.  the x_mid and y_mid values should not be involved in the high/low calculation at all, Only the current position and direction input matter.
 Nik05: Calculate your midpoint with your new bounds
 Husoski: And then do what Nik05 said.  Use the new high/low to make a guess.
 bortol: Finally got legend in UTTT with java, uh, was harder than expected
 heaven7: Will try... Thank you All!
 Husoski: yw
 Husoski: ...or should that be "np" this century?
 Husoski:&#160;:)
 Nik05: what is "yw"?
 Uljahn: u'r welcome
 Westicles: yahweh
 Nik05: Husoski in my language they now also using "no problem" or the directly translated version...
 jacek: UTTT legend in java? impossibru!
 Husoski: Nik05 Nederlands huh?  You're from the birthplace of Python!
 Nik05: yes
 Husoski: cool, very cool
 Nerchio: bortol good job it's not easy in java ^^
 heaven7: Just to report - once I start tracking the coordinate instead of the "mid" value - all is working! :D Such'a trivial problem... Thank you all again!

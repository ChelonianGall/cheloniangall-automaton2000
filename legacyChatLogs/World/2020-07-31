 Allison: Hmm...  Why isn't 2.47255199914939E+18 smaller than 3.73890469722706E+18?
 AbundantPuddle: I feel like that's a trick question...
 Allison: No, serious question... I don't get it.&#160;:|
 Allison: Both of them only have 14 numbers following the ., they're both E+18, so why isn't 2.47~ smaller than 3.73?
 AbundantPuddle: What language are you using? How are you comparing them? What is the code that you are using to reference them?
 AbundantPuddle: When dealing with very high and low numbers, different languages sometimes behave strangely.
 Allison: C#, if(closestDistance &lt; newDistance) closestDistance = newDistance
 AbundantPuddle: What type of variable is closestDistance and newDistance?
 Allison: Both doubles.
 AbundantPuddle: Yeah, I don't see why they wouldn't compare correctly. Have you tried debugging sections of your code?
 Allison: Yeah.  Gonna try changing doubles to floats and see if still upsetti spaghetti...
 AbundantPuddle: It's worth a shot. If it's still giving you trouble, I would make sure that those are absolutely the values those variables are getting at that point in the code.
 AbundantPuddle: Oh wait, are you sure it's not a logic error?
 AbundantPuddle: By the sound of the variables and assigning of the variables, aren't you checking to see if the new variablie is closer than the old one?
 AbundantPuddle: if(newDistance &lt; closestDistance) closestDistance = newDistance
 Allison: ..... &gt;.&gt;'<b></b>
 AbundantPuddle: Did that help solve the problem?
 Allison: *checks*
 Allison: I swear I've switched it from &gt; to &lt;
 Allison: andviceversa.
 AbundantPuddle: There could be other reasons as well. Just looking at the snippet of code you gave, that's one thing that I would check.
 Allison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d621e0d-f749-4e41-8d5d-c0f5f10bbb60">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5d621e0d-f749-4e41-8d5d-c0f5f10bbb60</a>
 AbundantPuddle: Something in your code is backwards because it's assigning the 5.1... over the 0 as well.
 Allison: Crap, forgot to reassign closest to 999999 before running. xD
 Allison: Alright, so reassigned, here are the results...
 Allison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0a543e7-cad3-4c53-865b-748e8b5d9c6a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d0a543e7-cad3-4c53-865b-748e8b5d9c6a</a>
 AbundantPuddle: Also, I'm not sure if you changed it in the code and just left it in the debug,  but you still seem to be comparing closestDistance&lt;newDistance.
 Allison: Yep, I left it like that intentionally.  Gonna switch it here in a second.
 AbundantPuddle: How are you assigning your variables? I find it odd that when you changed the 0 to 99999, it didn't have any effect on your code.
 AbundantPuddle: Which puzzle are you working on?
 Allison: Defibrillators.
 Allison: I'm so freaking confused at this point and may just start over and see if maybe I'm just being dumb.
 AbundantPuddle: Okay, I vaguely remember that one, although I did it in Python.
 AbundantPuddle: Are you assigning values to variables at multiple places in your code?
 Allison: Hmmmmmmm...  Possibly?  Let me check something...  Looking at this again....  Currently it's trying to say that there's (somehow) well over 10,000 km distance between a single ยบ long/lat.
 Allison: So something is *definitely* off there.
 AbundantPuddle: Even if the values weren't assigned correctly, from the debugging code you sent me, it seems like the comparing is not performing properly either, which means it wouldn't ven matter what the values were assigned.
 Allison: Yeah...  I'm not sure either why it was being so dumb, but.
 Allison: Fixing the error within the values did seem to fix it.
 AbundantPuddle: Is it working now?
 Allison: Yeah.&#160;:&gt;
 AbundantPuddle: I was just writing up a long winded message. Lol.
 Allison: I forgot to replace the ',' with '.' for the locations.
 AbundantPuddle: Well that's good. Glad you got it working.
 AbundantPuddle: Oh yeah, that makes sense.
 Allison: Probably made this more complicated than I needed to.. but.
 Allison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aceb37e4-5a97-412f-a073-fae94e4cf5bc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aceb37e4-5a97-412f-a073-fae94e4cf5bc</a>
 AbundantPuddle: I haven't delved  all that much in C# and it's been a while since I've worked in C++ or C, but your code is organized and easy to read, so it's okay in my book. Lol.
 Allison:&#160;:&gt;
 AbundantPuddle: But I'm heading off. Take it easy. Good luck.
 Allison: Take care, and thanks. :3
 AbundantPuddle: No problem.
 Bob: joy to the world
 Allison: Yo.
 Bob: shi&#160;?
 Allison: How's it going?
 Bob: fine
 Bob: last day at work before vacation&#160;:)
 Bob: your code for temperatures isn't all that complicated
 Allison: Temperatures? o _ o;;
 MSmits: Bob talking to his imaginary friend
 Bob: defibrillators
 Bob: not quite awake yet
 Allison: Oh. :D
 Allison: Oki. :P
 MSmits: grats on last day btw Bob, great feeling I know :P
 Bob: you could skip storing the defibs and just process them on the fly
 Allison: I was just thinking... "There's probably a much easier way to do this...."
 MSmits: better tonight even
 Bob: there might be more elgant ways to write it but that one's ok
 Bob: and it's a good exercise
 dbdr: Bob: don't forget to push breaking changes to production a few minutes before leaving
 MSmits: lol
 Allison: Now to just figure out this garbage.... =___=<i></i>
 Bob: dbdr&#160;:)
 Bob: dbdr: this has become harder now that we have pull requests and controlled merge to master
 Bob: I'd have to hide somewhere in a bit of obscure code
 MSmits: would be easy for me, most of my code is obscure
 Bob: in my previous project just anybody could commit to trunk, code review notwithstanding
 Bob: and it did happen more often than not where someone would fubar some important section of code bfore going off for 3 or 4 weeks
 MSmits: seems dangerous
 Putnam3145: oh my god the puzzle of the week is a sudoku checker
 Putnam3145: i've already written one of those!
 Allison: It wasn't too hard.&#160;:&gt;
 Allison: Iunno if mine was any good, but I solved it pretty easily. ^^;;
 Allison: And am super noob.
 Bob: I'm pretty sure I submitted something like that as a CoC
 Bob: all those years ago
 MSmits: when you were young
 dbdr: anyone can commit to trunk, but automated tests run, and if they fail that module is not upgraded
 dbdr: so it does not affect other modules and releases
 dbdr: including the tests of other modules that depend on it
 MSmits: that kind of hinges on the quality of those automated tests
 dbdr: sure
 Bob: boy how many crappy tests have I seen
 dbdr: but it scales well
 Bob: in our main software, we started doing tests when the software was already 15-20 years old
 dbdr: if I have good tests for my module, I don't have to worry that anyone will break my module when changing another one
 MSmits: you mean the chance for catastrophic bugs grows slowly with the size of the project, when you say scales well?
 Bob: needless to say, most of the tests just check that the code does what it did at the time
 Bob: and many of them don't even do it correctly
 dbdr: I mean behaves well when the number of modules/programmers grow
 MSmits: ah right
 dbdr: I can guarantee quality regardless of what other teams do
 Bob: this implies people are responsible for some specific section of the code
 dbdr: e.g. it's easy to have 3 great programmers, harder to have 100 good ones. so you need some mechanism to prevent mistakes from affecting everyone
 dbdr: right. personally I like code ownership
 dbdr: and decentralised vs centralized
 dbdr: precisely because it scales
 Allison: Ooofs...  I'm not even sure where to start with 1D Spreadsheet... D:
 MSmits: is that like when you make your excel window so small it only shows 1 row?
 Allison: Easy Puzzle.&#160;:\
 Allison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-spreadsheet">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-spreadsheet</a>
 MSmits: ohh I seem to have solved it
 dbdr: MSmits: yeah, we all love the 2D -&gt; 1D transformation&#160;:)
 Bob: make a function to compute the value of one cell
 MSmits: I have a cell class and a double loop with way too many ifs, if that helps
 dbdr: cell A(col * 128 + row)
 Bob: which parses the content
 Bob: gets the contents of the referenced cells, if any, and carries out the operation
 MSmits: ah yeah dbdr, you can make anything 1D that way
 MSmits: except for infinite spaces
 dbdr: you can for infinite too, just not this way
 Bob: a cell is basically either a value or an operation with two arguments
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: let's not get into that :P
 Bob: and an argument is either an actual value or the value of another cell
 Bob: so make a function to parse and return the value of an argument
 Bob: and one to parse and return the value of one cell
 dbdr: was it you MSmits who doesn't like these infinite things?&#160;:)
 MSmits: nah, i just need to do some shopping. I'd like it too much
 dbdr: lol
 Allison: Alright..  so, going by the $x, I'm assuming I'm also going to have to store cells as well?
 MSmits: ttyl&#160;:)
 dbdr: just do infinite shopping once and be done with it
 MSmits: will do, see you later, when the universe reboots
 dbdr: *clue Futurama scene
 Bob: I don't remember whether it's mandatory but it will definitely speed things up if you store the value of computed cells
 Bob: so you don't have to compute them multiple times
 Allis: You either need recursion or a loop that repeatedly runs until all the values have been reified.
 Allis: For 1D spreadsheet.
 Bob: yes the functions will recurse
 Allis: *recur :P
 Bob: ok&#160;:)
 Allison: Wuuuut. o _o ''
 Bob: the statement guarantees no cyclic references however
 Allison: Oh my. xD
 Bob: so you don't have to worry about infinite recursion
 Allis: Right.
 Bob: hmmm
 Bob: I'm having an idea for a new puzzle
 dbdr: 0D spreadsheet?
 Allison: Plz no. xD
 Allison: Now I wonder what a 3D SS would look like though... O_o<b></b>
 Bob: well, move to nD from 1D isn't really difficult
 Bob: it's just a matter of defining and parsing a syntax for the cell coordinates
 Bob: it's just like pikaptcha, if you design the first steps correctly, the next ones are super easy
 Bob: apart from debugging copy-paste mistakes when changing cube faces&#160;:)
 Allison: xD
 Allison: Well, I got up to Backward Dependency to work, but now I'm almost at a loss...
 Allison: This is kind of ebil....
 Bob: hmmm not sure what could go wrong
 Allison: I'm thinking... I have a few ideas, but I'm pretty sure I'd probably time it out if I did them...
 Bob: the design I have suggested earlier gives few opportunities of making mistakes
 Allison: I'll go back and reread.&#160;; -&#160;;
 Allison: I'm not very smurt.  Sorry.
 Bob: no it's okay
 Bob: consider that a cell is always operation arg1 arg2
 Bob: so the function value-of-cell just parses that and you have a simple if that computes the result of the operation
 Bob: and then an argument is either an actual value or a reference to another cell
 Bob: so there is a function value-of-arg which returns either the value or value-of-cell(reference)
 Bob: and that's pretty much it
 Allison: Yeah...  The issue I'm running into right now is when they're requesting data that hasn't been assigned yet because of order of loops...&#160;:\
 Bob: that's where you need to keep a list of computed and not-computed-yet values
 Allison: Yeah.
 Allison: I'm seeing this. &lt;3
 Bob: value-of-cell starts by checking whether you do have a value for the cell
 Bob: if yes, you return it
 Bob: if not, you compute it, store it and return it
 Bob: this is probably necessary to not timeout on the last case anyway

 LeBaoHoang8A4: Hello, i'm in wood league of Spring challenge. Now i need to control 5 pacs. do they have different pacID?
 Bob: yes
 LeBaoHoang8A4: thanks
 Bob: note that the id is unique *within a team*
 Bob: so there are two pacs #0, one for you and one for the opponent
 LeBaoHoang8A4: it means that all my pacs have pacID 0?
 MSmits: your pacs 0,1,2,3,4
 MSmits: his pacs 0,1,2,3,4
 MSmits: unique within team means, all different within team
 MSmits: but same as other team
 MSmits: the input tells you it's your pac, so there is no problem there
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok
 MSmits: you can also just error-print the input and you'll see
 LeBaoHoang8A4: got it
 VirtualAtom: e
 VirtualAtom: (oups, sorry, wrong window)
 jrke: yeah finished all paths of quest
 Bob: gg
 jrke: My last quest was 100 achievements out which 7 were left
 jrke: i solved Rubik@ in 7 different lang&#160;;)
 Bob: you mean not all&#160;?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Hi, how to print the MOVE of all my pacs?
 Bob: on one line, separated by |
 JBM: on stdout
 Bob: e.g.MOVE 0 27 11 | MOVE 1 5 3 | MOVE 2 17 6 | MOVE 3 5 9
 Bob: you can add some text to be displayed after each pac's command, e.g.MOVE 0 27 11 hello | MOVE 1 5 3 world
 Bob: you can omit one pac entirely if you don't want it to move for this turn
 Allison: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/36ec708f-9a4a-4355-a939-a33756e5921c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/36ec708f-9a4a-4355-a939-a33756e5921c</a>
 Allison: Well, that wasn't what I wanted to happen, but okay. xD
 Allis: No, that won't work. If everything is solved, you hit the `continue` every time and thus `unsolved` never gets updated.
 Allis: Oh, but that's correct. Then `unsolved` will be false. Sorry, I got confused by the double-negative.
 Allison: Is all good.  My apologies for wording it weirdly.
 Allis: Easier for me personally to comprehend would be something like `done = true; foreach { if (!x.solved) done = false) }
 Allison: Could just change variable names and make it more consistent. :P
 Allis: Either way, you've got the right idea as far as determining when you're finished processing the cells.
 Allison: There's more that's happening after that, just wasn't entirely relevant. 
 Allis: Yes, of course.
 Allis: The part that tripped me up when I thought I had it was that the VALUE operation can take a reference rather than an immediate value, so keep an eye on that.
 Allis: It's a really rewarding puzzle to solve, though, so stick with it. You got this!&#160;:)
 Allison: I think I got it.
 Allis: Awesome.
 Allison: All test cases completed successfully.&#160;:&gt;
 Allison: Hecks yeah.
 Bob: gg
 HXLYTT: โTimeout: your program did not provide an input in due time. Earth was destroyed!โanyone knows how to solve this??
 Allison: Your loops are taking too long to complete, either you're doing too many loops or you're stuck in an infinite loop.
 DomiKo: hi
 HXLYTT: oh
 HXLYTT: thanks
 Allison: Hi hi
 jacek: ohai
 DomiKo: how is morning going?
 Astrobytes: My morning is like a jellyfish
 Astrobytes: A bit wobbly but moving forward in a graceful fashion
 Allison: xD
 Allison: I like that allusion.
 Allison: Going okay, how about yourself, Domi?
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: that that phrase
 DomiKo: awesome
 DomiKo: my morning equals debugging physic
 Astrobytes: Soul destroying?
 DomiKo: kinda
 DomiKo: but i'm telling myself SCB will be fun...
 DomiKo: so at least I have hope :joy:
 Astrobytes: SCB?
 DomiKo: CSB
 DomiKo: *
 DomiKo: *
 Astrobytes: Ah
 Astrobytes: You're trying to get Legend or improve your Legend?
 MSmits: CSB is ok. It's just getting the sim right is annoying
 Astrobytes: Bit of a pain, yep
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: ot
 DomiKo: it's like i know what my sim should be
 DomiKo: should do*
 DomiKo: but he's not...
 MSmits: my rank hasn't changed for over a year I think
 Astrobytes: 5th?
 DomiKo: not many people will try that hard
 MSmits: 6th
 DomiKo: i guess
 MSmits: everyone above me is NN
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 MSmits: feels like oware :P
 Astrobytes: Neuman n is NN too?
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: not sure
 Astrobytes: I thought he did Smitsi, could be wrong
 MSmits: that would be cool
 MSmits: his previous version was mm I think, but this one must be better
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was a while back when I noticed he'd climbed up there, I asked him but I don't remember what he said
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: 100 more characters of torture in cotr
 MSmits: then I have all validators maually solved
 MSmits: I blame the quest map
 Astrobytes: Oh, I'm not a fan of CotR
 MSmits: I like it, but not enough to spend time on an algorithm
 MSmits: so I solve all of them manually
 MSmits: the first 14 or so are easily done, the last one is 300+ characters
 MSmits: so i have to type in a string of like 1500 brainfk instructions
 Astrobytes: Whatever works for the quest is fine&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah i beat the quest without the last one, but then i was ranked 361 out of 4k
 MSmits: and i guess i can shave a lot of characters off that last validator if i did it manually
 MSmits: unfortunately it is the entire text on the ring :P
 Astrobytes: Got my quest and ditched it. Put it back on my Really Bored Emergency List. Hopefully I'll never get round to it again
 fuckboiiii: hi
 fuckboiiii: i love you
 MSmits: will do that too, once i am done with this line
 MSmits: thanks random troll
 Astrobytes: 1 week later, running an offline brainfk optimiser...
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: no no, i am going to try other things after this
 Astrobytes: Good
 DomiKo: oh yes I found cause of bug
 fuckboiiii: Is this a dating app?
 Astrobytes: Are you gonna play Atari Go?
 DomiKo: you can date nice game
 fuckboiiii: i am male
 fuckboiiii: 180 cm
 MSmits: not for a long time Astrobytes, it's not high on my list
 fuckboiiii: good looking
 MSmits: I got breakthrough before that
 Astrobytes: fuckboiiii: do you have anything useful to add to the conversation? Or would you like to be kicked out?
 MSmits: you have to kick yourself for bad language if you say his name
 Astrobytes: Ah, the big board size putting you off of Go?
 MSmits: kinda, i have no idea what to do there
 MSmits: dont want to go down the go rabbit-hole
 fuckboiiii: we are the world
 Astrobytes: I'm just learning
 fuckboiiii: I love mankind
 MSmits: othello was much easier, at least to get a working bot. I just have 7 parameters and thats it
 fuckboiiii: hello world
 fuckboiiii: i am god
 Astrobytes: Want a free ban?
 MSmits: think you can kick him Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I did
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: gj
 Astrobytes: Banned
 dbdr: damn, missed my chance to try my inaugurate my mod rights :D
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 DomiKo: close
 dbdr: Astro did it by the book, warn, kick, ban
 MSmits: he's a by the book kinda guy
 MSmits: me too
 dbdr: ah, no, kick, warn, ban
 MSmits: on yavalath
 MSmits: oware
 dbdr: that's wrong. burn him!
 MSmits: uttt
 dbdr: or rather, ban&#160;;)
 MSmits: he said a bad word too
 MSmits: do you see a history of mod actions dbdr?
 MSmits: or are you just inferring this from the chat?:
 dbdr: it's on the webchat
 MSmits: oh ok
 dbdr: "fuckboiiii has been kicked by Astrobytes."
 MSmits: now you said the bad word too&#160;:(
 dbdr: dark gray en darker gray&#160;:)
 dbdr: oh I see. I didn't even notice it I think
 dbdr: what word MSmits?
 MSmits: the name
 MSmits: of the troll
 dbdr: what name?
 Allison: Oh, I didn't see any of that, I just saw him getting kicked... Assumed it was due to name.
 MSmits: I've got brain
 dbdr: :P
 dbdr: more than me
 jacek: coitusboii
 MSmits: coรฏtus
 dbdr: I think beahviour was more problematic than just the name
 MSmits: the name was a nice hint
 dbdr: true
 MSmits: btw, what kind of algo did you use for cotr dbdr?
 MSmits: ga.sa&#160;?
 MSmits: just wondering, not gonna try it myself
 MSmits: ack, my handtyped solution for the last validator is so long, it's messing up the language assist colouring
 MSmits: 20 more words to go
 dbdr: you did it by hand???
 MSmits: yeppers
 MSmits: 1 more
 dbdr: beam search, if I remember well
 MSmits: all other validators solved
 dbdr: what's wrong with you?&#160;;)
 MSmits: dunno, it's the fault of the quest map
 MSmits: i was trying to get it under 6k
 dbdr: I mean, why by hand
 MSmits: and when i did, there was just this last validator left
 dbdr: you of all people
 MSmits: because I had 2 paths. To get a solution better than a handmade solution would actually require more time I think
 MSmits: it's not that easy
 dbdr: you need to metamcts this cotr&#160;;)
 MSmits: I can get top 50 I bet, with handmade
 dbdr: probably
 dbdr: not sure it takes less time though
 MSmits: for me it will
 dbdr: but also depends how you feel, that's fine
 MSmits: I dont have a ready made solution for optimization
 dbdr: true, it's different from multis, so maybe more time to get productive
 dbdr: it was my first, IITC
 MSmits: like ga, sa, never written a working one
 dbdr: IIRC
 dbdr: but beamsearch you have&#160;;)
 MSmits: sure, but i didnt even think of that
 jacek: you never did GA? D:
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: i was gonna do sa first, because i fully understand it
 MSmits: seems easy
 MSmits: but havent gotten around to that
 MSmits: ga seems messy, too much to experiment with
 MSmits: I like my parameter space smaller
 dbdr: just ga your ga parameters
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: its gas all the way down
 MSmits: that's a discworld reference?
 MSmits: turtles?
 jacek: i was briefly hooked to swarm particle optimization but many places have different implementation detaisl
 dbdr: yeah
 jacek: and it also has paraemeters, so meh
 Astrobytes: I did warn, kick, warn ban btw actually
 dbdr: turtles
 dbdr: don't know about discworld
 MSmits: ah yes its not discworld
 dbdr: ah, even better Astrobytes&#160;:+1:&#160;:)
 MSmits: discworld does have a bunch of turtles stacked
 MSmits: but not infinite
 Allison: I want turtles... :O
 dbdr: noob
 SPDene: why did I read the "gas" in "gas all the way down" as the plural of "ga"? I think I'm coding too much!
 dbdr: lol SPDene
 DomiKo: MSmuts you have to try GA
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: yeah that is a sure sigh
 MSmits: sign
 DomiKo: it's so much fun
 dbdr: I noticed it and decided to keep it for fun
 MSmits: why is it fun?
 DomiKo: more parameters =&gt; more fun
 MSmits: maybe i need a template to mess around with
 Allison: As long as it's not LiveCode....
 dbdr: a physicist might understand "gas all the way down" in a different way
 dbdr: if we had one
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: maybe also a intestinal physician
 dbdr: which might be true cosmologically?
 dbdr: yeah
 SPDene: oh, so you're not talking about a parachutist who ate beans for breakfast? :P
 MSmits: ah thats both
 dbdr: problem is gas is not well defined I guess
 MSmits: never heard a cosmologist say, gas all the way down
 MSmits: and they say a lot of weird stuff
 dbdr: once the pressure gets too low to make sense statitically
 MSmits: density mostly
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: well the laws are statistical
 MSmits: so timescales would just be longer
 MSmits: less collisions, so takes a lot of time to get some kind of equilibrium after a disturbance
 MSmits: maybe it's more a matter of how many particles you have, because if you make the space small enough, no density is going to give you working statistical physics
 MSmits: and if you make it large enough and wait long enough any density &gt; 0 works
 MSmits: damnit dbdr, i need to finish my ring sentence :P
 dbdr: competition happens at all levels, including distracting on chat&#160;;)
 dbdr: reminds me I need to retake #1 on CotR
 MSmits: so who made us obsess over that ascii game last night?
 dbdr: :innocent:
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: btw, that last validator is pretty lazy. They just did the ring sentence and introduce 2 typos
 Allison: Any of the easy puzzles any of you would recommend I hate myself while trying to accomplish?
 MSmits: did you do the batman?
 MSmits: its officially medium
 MSmits: but its pretty easy
 Allison: Shadows of the Knight?
 MSmits: yes
 Allison: I will try it.....
 MSmits: it's fun
 MSmits: and you get graphics
 Allison: I'm bad at these.... xD
 MSmits: you should do all the classic puzzles with graphics
 MSmits: the skynet ones are cool too
 MSmits: bit harder
 MSmits: very good practice though
 MSmits: for learning searches
 DomiKo: is there any rule for what time you will advance to next league?
 Astrobytes: is it CSB?
 MSmits: probably, dont know exactly
 DomiKo: yes
 Astrobytes: oh no
 DomiKo: long time?
 Astrobytes: Yeah at least a few hours
 MSmits: i remember being relieved
 MSmits: ohh, i can finally sleep
 MSmits: and then i woke up and was top 5 :P
 DomiKo: wow
 Astrobytes: mine was on a Saturday, in the summer, late afternoon/early evening
 MSmits: DomiKo this was when the NN's werent here
 Allison: I hate you MS. xD
 DomiKo: wish me luck
 MSmits: I spent 2 months after this trying to beat this 1 guy with a super minimax
 MSmits: but his bot is no longer alive
 DomiKo: still have some bugs
 Astrobytes: ah pen
 MSmits: yes&#160;:(
 MSmits: he should be up there
 DomiKo: legend is so big
 MSmits: yeah
 DomiKo: i'm wondering where i will be
 DomiKo: it's the best part
 MSmits: the interesting part about csb is that small differences in bot strength lead to 100% winrates
 DomiKo: when advancing
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: actualy true
 MSmits: so if you're weaker than someone else, you'll probably lose everything
 MSmits: at the top we had brackets of maybe 3-4 players that dont always beat one another and beat everyone below them
 DomiKo: really excited
 MSmits: several of those brackets, they are like whole leagues
 Astrobytes: There are mini-leagues the whole way up CSB legend
 DomiKo: sounds fun
 MSmits: sure, it's not really my kind of game, but some parts of it are definitely fun
 DomiKo: graphics is super coooll
 MSmits: yeah
 DomiKo: i like showing my replays to friends
 Astrobytes: What are you using for CSB DomiKo?
 DomiKo: GA
 MSmits: btw, once you have the sim down good, you can also try bit runner 2k
 Astrobytes: Cool
 Astrobytes: Yeah, BR2K is awesome
 DomiKo: yes i will
 MSmits: never got to highest league there
 Allison: I definitely don't know where to start with this one, MSmits...&#160;:\  I'm such a noob...
 MSmits: you mean batman?
 Astrobytes: I must get back to BR at some point
 Allison: Yeah...
 MSmits: you need binary search Allison
 Astrobytes: Batman?
 MSmits: jump to the space between the current position and the edge of the  map
 Astrobytes: Oh Shadows of the Knight
 MSmits: so if you're at x = 3
 MSmits: and the bomb is to the right and the max  for x = 10
 MSmits: 3 + 10/2 = 6
 MSmits: you jump to x = 6
 MSmits: put some parentheses in there
 Allison: Hmmm... Oki.
 MSmits: (3+10)/2
 MSmits: do this for x and y both
 MSmits: also, remember y increases downwards
 MSmits: so south = higher y
 Allison: Kk... Let's see if I can figure dis out. :O
 MSmits: this is actually how I learned the algorithm binary search
 MSmits: never heard of it before
 DomiKo: never heard of "guessing the hidden number?"
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: except if you mean mastermind, i knew that, but thats different
 DomiKo: it's like the little game
 MSmits: i know it now DomiKo
 MSmits: it's how i teach binary search to students
 DomiKo: lag*
 MSmits: i give them batman if they're bored after finishing all other assignments
 DomiKo: sometimes CG chat lag is huge for me i guess
 MSmits: some of my students solved it
 MSmits: yeah sometimes it is
 Astrobytes: yep
 Scarfield: you need to exclude as many possible cell positions as possible for each jump. you get the bombs relative postition to batman, so each time you want to go to the middle of your current not-yet-excluded cells (rows and columns)
 MSmits: lagField&#160;?
 MSmits: nice explanation though
 Scarfield: SlowField is soon my nick :p
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: hehe
 Allison: SlowLagField?&#160;:&gt;
 Scarfield: yea i felt an explanation was better than only the process
 MSmits: Allison if you cant figure out batman, you can always try other easy puzzles. It's not hard but there are easier ones. It's not my intention to discourage you
 Allison: I'm not easy to discourage.&#160;:&gt;  
 MSmits: good&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Excellent attitude&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: me neither... I've never given up on a puzzle yet, but some did take me a day or two
 Scarfield: and a tip, i didnt notice the "external ressources" links for puzzles when i started here. Before clicking solve it, there are links for the intended algorithms/approaches to thepuzzles intent
 MSmits: for some reason marslander 2 was really really hard for me
 Allison: If I find a task daunting within regards to programming, I either A: look up ways to do part of what I'm looking to do... 
 Scarfield: or/flip
 Scarfield: (โฏยฐโกยฐ๏ผโฏ๏ธต โปโโป
 Allison: B: Work on something else for a while that may have similar concepts; C: Ask someone if they may be able to assist me in understanding....
 Allison: Or D: As a last resort, look at someone else's method and try to understand what they did and why.
 MSmits: batman is googleable, but do that as a last resort
 MSmits: i had one student plagiarizing it
 MSmits: then I asked him to explain to me how the solution works :grin:
 Allison: Yeah, not looking to have answers given to me unless I absolutely just can't wrap my head around it.
 Allison: xD
 Astrobytes: Nice. That or boiling oil would do the trick.
 Allison: And he was like, "Uh...  Iunno... "
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: I think it was even stupider
 MSmits: I think he said something like: umm, the website didnt explain how it works
 Astrobytes: That's why you need the boiling oil.
 Scarfield: boiling oil?
 MSmits: hmm i would have to check the teachers manual. I don't think the boiling oil is in there
 Astrobytes: Torture may be illegal but hey, it works&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: (I am kidding)
 MSmits: lol
 Scarfield: oh thought it was some expression xD
 DomiKo: 97% CSB lets see how much i have to wait :joy:
 Astrobytes: This is the sort of stuff my highschool teachers used to come out with
 MSmits: if you have to explain that you're kidding about torture, you're in  a really weird place Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: LOL
 Scarfield: yea UK has changed lately :p
 DomiKo: 1:02 :open_mouth:
 MSmits: 1 hr 2 minutes?
 Astrobytes: No, not changed. Just not bothering to hide things any more Scarfield 
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: only 1H wow
 MSmits: thats not bad
 MSmits: i think i had to wait over 4 hrs
 Astrobytes: That's not bad at all, I waited 5 or 6 hrs
 DomiKo: the worst one for me was 6H
 MSmits: oh... are you on an all-legend spree?
 DomiKo: I'am on road to guru
 dbdr: it's Legend all the way up
 MSmits: ahh I see
 MSmits: I was gonna say we could always use more gurus
 MSmits: but we never get more gurus 
 Scarfield: xD
 DomiKo: xD
 DomiKo: personal challange to reach guru before new semester
 MSmits: you're going to steal someone else's guru
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 MSmits: dont you feel bad about that?
 DomiKo: mayby 101 will be ok too?
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: if you want to be a measly grandmaster
 DomiKo: the best grandmaster?
 DomiKo: is this a thing?
 MSmits: thats true
 Scarfield: the grandest?
 DomiKo: grandgrandaster?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/">https://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/</a>
 MSmits: you can use this too
 MSmits: though i dont know when it was last updated
 DomiKo: iam using this for multi
 DomiKo: watching winrate is so useful
 MSmits: thats cg stats right?
 DomiKo: yes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/?user=cf4e1a99c35a5c4b9774dfd98702b03f5308692">https://apps.rezonux.com/codingame/?user=cf4e1a99c35a5c4b9774dfd98702b03f5308692</a>
 MSmits: i added your profile id
 MSmits: check where you're missing points
 DomiKo: Atari is second in less missing
 DomiKo: and i have 0 points
 DomiKo: lol
 DomiKo: i still have a lot 0points games
 MSmits: yeah me too though
 MSmits: I played about half
 MSmits: you can be guru playing about a quarter of them  I think
 MSmits: contests help too
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: i have 45K and i need 68K
 MSmits: 5-6 multis
 DomiKo: it's doable
 MSmits: or 50 clashes and 4-5 multis
 MSmits: unless you already did that
 DomiKo: I'm clashing since 2018 i guess
 JollyGood: hi i have a question, im new
 MSmits: ohh ok, I've been clashing 2 days total, sometime early this week
 JollyGood: is it OK to copy paste code from internet?
 JollyGood: for any challenge
 Astrobytes: No.
 MSmits: well...
 JollyGood: not even a part?
 Astrobytes: Why would you do such a thing?
 JollyGood: like, a small part
 MSmits: need to make this more specific
 JollyGood: no, I just wanna know
 PlungeDominick: This clash's test cases are horrendous 
 SPDene: hmm. so somehow the width of the CG IDE has changed, such that O can only see the code window if I drag the browser over 2 monitors. clearing cookies didn't fix it. anyone seen this before? 
 MSmits: you can take algorithms from internet
 Astrobytes: hehe, as long as you don't copy a full solution
 JollyGood: yeah thats what I was asking
 MSmits: adapt them
 MSmits: thats fine
 JollyGood: okay thanks
 MSmits: but some people shared whole bots on google, thats not ok
 JollyGood: uhhh
 Astrobytes: Yep, you'll find new algorithms and want to apply them, so definitely do that
 JollyGood: yeah, cz no point wasting time inventing an algorithm when its already there on internet right
 Astrobytes: Well, you're gonna want to understand it too
 JollyGood: well, yeah 
 Astrobytes: So you can code it by yourself in the future
 DomiKo: you can invent sth for specific game
 JollyGood: hmm
 DomiKo: so you need to really understand what you are doing
 DomiKo: and why
 JollyGood: true
 JollyGood: okay thanks
 Astrobytes: Yup, sometimes you can adapt algorithms for specific purposes, and ... yeah what DomiKo said&#160;:)
 JollyGood: got it
 Scarfield: i have recoded the same search algo 3 times now for different multies. It has gotten neater and faster each time, and i learned a lot, instead of just copy pasting it. 10/10 would recommend
 JollyGood: ohhh
 MSmits: same
 JollyGood: so you took a lot of time the first time right
 DomiKo: every time
 Scarfield: looked at my Bandas bot the other day, yuk :p
 JollyGood: i just got my first software engineering job and, ii feel like my code is so messy, and I take a lot of time to do something when trying on my own
 MSmits: however, this is most noticable when the search is a large part of your bot. Some multis have a 600 line simulation. Then it's nice to have a search ready but you'll spend more time with the sim 
 MSmits: board games have a simple sim, so the search takes the most time there
 Scarfield: yea the first time took the longest, now i feel like i almost know it by heart :p
 JollyGood: ohhh
 JollyGood: so it's normal to feel like
 JollyGood: I suck?
 JollyGood: when trying for first time
 JollyGood: i mean
 Astrobytes: Of course! That happens
 MSmits: isnt it always like that?
 JollyGood: like i constantly have doubts T.T
 JollyGood: yeah but
 MSmits: with everything you learn?
 JollyGood: most of the ppl around me, they do it so fast (they r more experienced than me though)
 DomiKo: man
 DomiKo: i still suck
 JollyGood: aww
 MSmits: I sucked when i got here 2 yrs ago
 JollyGood: sometiems I feeel like i should change careers, I hate not knowing something
 Astrobytes: Your confidence will grow the more you do it but you'll still feel like you're sucking at it sometimes
 JollyGood: ahhh
 MSmits: understood basic coding, no algorithms
 MSmits: and physics ofc
 JollyGood: so its common this feeling
 JollyGood: thtas why I came here
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: but
 JollyGood: i want to impove
 JollyGood: *improve
 DomiKo: that is key
 MSmits: good place to be
 Astrobytes: 100%
 DomiKo: if you want to improve you will be good
 JollyGood: and it's nice to find a community like this
 JollyGood: awww
 DomiKo: this comunity is soooo goood
 Astrobytes: Yep. You get out what you put into it.
 JollyGood: I hope so too
 MSmits: you do need to know a single language fairly well. Loops and conditions and all that
 JollyGood: hmm
 MSmits: but once you have that, you can learn the rest here
 DomiKo: and then some opti trick
 JollyGood: i see
 DomiKo: in that language
 Scarfield: and if you wanna improve, i suggest not copy pasting at all&#160;:)
 JollyGood: so first I should master one language?
 JollyGood: haha
 MSmits: not master
 JollyGood: okay then I'll try
 MSmits: i havent mastered any language
 MSmits: just be able to use it
 JollyGood: oh&#160;:/ 
 MSmits: the simple stuff
 MSmits: i'd suggest python
 DomiKo: mastering language is weird phrase
 JollyGood: realllyy
 MSmits: easiest if you know nothing
 MSmits: if you already know a language, do that one first
 JollyGood: ok so best to stick to one language first right
 JollyGood: ill try python then, thanks
 MSmits: at some point you'll want a fast language for some specific purposes, you can always learn one of those then
 MSmits: but they are usually much harder to learn
 JollyGood: ah
 JollyGood: &gt;.&lt; 
 MSmits: its not needed for many things
 MSmits: all puzzles can be done with python
 MSmits: over half the multis also
 MSmits: clashes
 MSmits: etc.
 MSmits: so python is fine
 MSmits: i use it too
 JollyGood: yeah, i saw python is most popular language out there 
 JollyGood: thanks all for your advice!!!
 MSmits: yeah, its just not the best choice for bots that require millions of simulations per second
 JollyGood: oh
 JollyGood: then what is?
 MSmits: but there isnt anythign like that needed for you any time soon
 JollyGood: C++?
 MSmits: or Rust
 JollyGood: ah
 MSmits: or for somewhat slower, but easier, C# or java
 MSmits: or Go
 JollyGood: hmm
 MSmits: algorithms are almost always more important than the speed of your language
 JollyGood: then it's easier to code right
 MSmits: and typing a python program will generally be 3-5 times faster to do than doing the same in c++ etc.
 MSmits: thats what i mean yes
 JollyGood: ahhhh ok understood
 MSmits: python is easy to code in
 MSmits: C#/java also, but python is more beginner friendly
 JollyGood: niiice
 JollyGood: I'll try python
 MSmits: rule of thumb, the easier it is to code in a language, the less optimized your code will be
 MSmits: not a general truth, but a rule of thumb
 JollyGood: i see
 MSmits: but if you dont need optimized code.... 
 JollyGood: yep, got it
 PlungeDominick: or if you wanna lose shortest clashes 
 JollyGood: jeez, learned so much just from yall, than textbooks. thanks!!!
 MSmits: np
 jacek: rust eh?
 PlungeDominick: rust :flushed:
 MSmits: rust is just as fast as c++ isnt it?
 Putnam3145: yes
 TonIsHere: is lua good to learn?
 Putnam3145: yes
 TonIsHere: i want a sugg
 TonIsHere: oh ok]
 Putnam3145: well, rather, what are you planning to use it for
 MSmits: is lua good to learn if you have the choice between python and lua?
 Putnam3145: it's good at one thing, and EXTREMELY good at it
 MSmits: whats that?
 Putnam3145: and that thing is acting as an embedded scripting language
 Putnam3145: it's very small and rather fast
 Putnam3145: personally I've mostly only used it for, weirdly enough, memory hacking APIs
 Putnam3145: like, completely disparate ones that decided to use Lua independently
 Putnam3145: Bizhawk and DFHack in particular
 TonIsHere: Most ppl use lua to hax
 PlungeDominick: oh god
 Putnam3145: i think cheat engine has support too?
 Putnam3145: which is another memory hacking library
 Putnam3145: or application rather
 Putnam3145: I've never used it
 Magus: I read that Rust is a little slower than C++, but Rust features for multithread code are so damn good that the benefit is above the performances need in many cases
 Magus: but i never benchmarked anything myself between the 2 languages
 Putnam3145: I actually wrote some multithreaded C++ earlier today
 Putnam3145: ...and working in a sort of terrible DLL hook situation where I'm dealing with memory managed by another game engine, and if I ever try to do anything at all with any of that memory I instantly get a segfault
 Magus: but for CG, since we don't have optimizations flags for many languages, i can't really say what is faster between C++ and Rust
 Putnam3145: I'm using D cause I'm an obsessive with it
 Magus: i think is faster since we can have the pragmas and we are one threaded
 Magus: *i think C++ is faster
 MSmits: i was more thinking about order of magnitude
 MSmits: c++ and rust are the same in that sense
 MSmits: C# and java and go are on a lower level
 Magus: yes
 MSmits: what other languages are on the same level with C++ and rust? Besides C&#160;?
 Magus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/rust-gpp.html">https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/rust-gpp.html</a>
 Allison: Alright..  Getting screwed over on Tower and above for testing things....
 Magus: it seems than Rust can effectively compare to C++ in performance. I suppose some will says that C++ g++ is bad and slow, but i can't really find other sources :D
 RoboStac: rust / c++ performance is basically identical these days. The biggest difference in benchmarks tends to be differences in data structures used in the standard library
 MSmits: ah ok
 RoboStac: (eg c++ map / unordered_map have restrictions that mean they can never be very fast)
 MSmits: do you guys know other languages with comparable speed?
 Magus: i don't know anything except C++/C/Rust for performances
 MSmits: hmm ok, that makes Rust a lot more interesting to learn
 MSmits: if there is not much alternative
 RoboStac: just be prepared for pain using rust on cg as you can't force optimisation in the ide
 MSmits: yeah I know =/
 jacek: i have a great idea. lets turn on rust optimization in ide and turn off in submits
 Putnam3145: D
 jacek: and let the rusters go wtf
 Putnam3145: is pretty dang fast
 Putnam3145: mostly when using LDC though
 MSmits: lol
 Putnam3145: also if you like
 Putnam3145: know how to finagle the GC
 Putnam3145: which is a bit of an ordeal
 Allison: MSmits, am I going to need an offset, too?
 MSmits: for batman?&gt;
 Allison: Yeah.
 MSmits: you need to keep track of your own position
 MSmits: every time you output it
 MSmits: so store your new position
 MSmits: so that you can calculate the new position to jump to
 MSmits: the output is not relative
 MSmits: you output absolute coordinates
 Scarfield: try and make a simple drawing of the process of a few turns&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah, that helps
 Allison: Oooh... wait....
 MSmits: dbdr, made rank 48 with handcrafted solutions&#160;:)
 MSmits: lucky guess with that top 50&#160;:)
 MSmits: 3474 total score
 MSmits: that means I typed 3474 characters by hand =/
 Scarfield: those poor 2 fingers :p
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: It's not actually a bad thing to do if you want to test a GA or SA, makes for a good benchmark
 MSmits: or beamsearch or whatever
 DomiKo: MSmits 3K chars really...
 TonIsHere: hi
 DomiKo: so lets the submit in legend begin!
 dbdr: gz MSmits
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Hello, in wood1 league in Spring challenge they say i need to control 5 pacs but why PINKY(BOSS) controls 2 pacs?
 JBM: what a loser
 LeBaoHoang8A4: me?
 JBM: pinky
 LeBaoHoang8A4: but why?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Why PINKY controls 2?
 JBM: don't ask me
 Schwase: lollll
 LeBaoHoang8A4: HAHA
 SPDene: but why shouldn't we ask you JBM? :P
 RoboStac: you both have the same number at the start - 5 is the maximum
 Schwase: jbm only takes responsibility for his monstrosities, not anyone else's
 JBM: exactly
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OH GOSH
 Schwase: im doing firmware development and after 3 weeks of having v115 i received v116 to test and today i got v117 lol
 Schwase: thanks for the interval testing material
 Schwase: literally 2 in 2 days
 Schwase: "it should be ready tomorrow"
 Schwase: coders last words
 LeBaoHoang8A4: But why when i test my code, PINKY has 2 pacs
 LeBaoHoang8A4: RoboStac  07:31PMyou both have the same number at the start - 5 is the maximum
 SPDene: I'm just guessing, but probably something to do with the number of pacs&#160;:)
 LeBaoHoang8A4: you mean i can have 2 or 3?
 MSmits: or 4
 LeBaoHoang8A4: yep
 LeBaoHoang8A4: haha
 SPDene: it says "you will control up to 5 pacs" in the rules
 LeBaoHoang8A4: whatever
 MSmits: that's actually a wrong statement
 MSmits: it should be 1 to 5
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OH
 MSmits: or is it 2?
 SPDene: to me, thaat's what "up to 5" means
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OH man, this is hard
 MSmits: LeBaoHoang8A4 spring challenge is definitely not the easiest multi to pick if you're a beginner
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OK
 TheBarnacle: Is there any way to measure small gains on the coders-strike-back puzzle? Or is the only way to measure improvement to beat the boss?
 TheBarnacle: I don't see a timer or anything
 MSmits: you can count the frames
 TheBarnacle: Ohhh, thank you!
 MSmits: np
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Hey MSmits, how can you color your letters?
 MSmits: i dont, you just see it that way when your name is in the statement
 MSmits: LeBaoHoang8A4
 MSmits: type my name fast by starting the word and finishing with tab key
 LeBaoHoang8A4: let me try
 LeBaoHoang8A4: MSmits
 MSmits: i see that as red
 MSmits: you dont
 MSmits: MSmits
 Astrobytes: LeBaoHoang8A4
 LeBaoHoang8A4: wow
 Astrobytes: LeBaoHoang8A4
 Astrobytes: LeBaoHoang8A4
 MSmits: you dont see your own name in red apparently
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 MSmits: if you type it
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Astrobytes
 MSmits: shame, i wanted to ping myself
 LeBaoHoang8A4: haha
 Astrobytes: Yep LeBaoHoang8A4.
 LeBaoHoang8A4: when was you guys learning to code?
 TheSpiffiest: 1988? :P
 LeBaoHoang8A4: 2020
 MSmits: I think I learned somewhat over the course of 2010-2017 by doing modding for games and learned most of the rest (which is most) here on CG
 LeBaoHoang8A4: so long, i've learned for 6 months
 TheSpiffiest: It's silly. I've got 30 years experience in something that takes 3 years to master. 
 MSmits: the yoyo?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: whut?
 MSmits: oh wait you're still talking about coding :P
 LeBaoHoang8A4: HAHA
 LeBaoHoang8A4: You guys are grown up, i don't see any people at my age
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: well half of them are trolls and they get banned :P
 LeBaoHoang8A4: let me guess, you are 30?
 MSmits: almost 40
 MSmits: februari will be 40
 MSmits: we have young players too
 MSmits: many around 20 I think, students
 MSmits: some younger ones too
 LeBaoHoang8A4: almost 14October i will be 14
 MSmits: yeah thats young for CG, but you're not unique for sure
 Astrobytes: jrke is 12 or 13
 wlesavo: wow, MSmits actually quite young, i thought you close to 50th
 MSmits: haha just spiritually :P
 wlesavo: lol
 Astrobytes: I'm 37 but feel 67
 Scarfield: his avatar is not a picture of him :p
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OH MAN, sorry for you
 LeBaoHoang8A4: his cat
 Scarfield: btw le 'stro, any news about your back?
 MSmits: it's not  a beheaded ca i think LeBaoHoang8A4
 MSmits: cat
 wlesavo: Scarfield :grinning:
 MSmits: just looks that way
 Astrobytes: Still waiting on bone density scan Scarfield, but I have some new medication which is helping a little bit better
 MSmits: but they will do surgery for sure?
 Scarfield: thats nice at least
 MSmits: just a matter of time?
 Astrobytes: I don't know MSmits
 MSmits: hm ok
 Astrobytes: The primary objective rn is to find out why I have osteoporosis at the age of 37
 Scarfield: do you know its osteoporosis yet?
 MSmits: oh i didnt know it was that
 Scarfield: i thought you needed the density scan to be sure of that?
 Astrobytes: Yes I do, but it's still the prime suspect
 LeBaoHoang8A4: go to the doctor for sure
 MSmits: he did
 Astrobytes: LeBaoHoang8A4 I certainly have been
 MSmits: he's been dealing with this for months
 LeBaoHoang8A4: ok
 LeBaoHoang8A4: i'm sorry
 Astrobytes: No need! I'm alive&#160;:)
 MSmits: Astrobytes so it wasnt caused by something you did wrong in the garden or anything, there was an underlying condition
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits
 LeBaoHoang8A4: :wink:
 LeBaoHoang8A4: wanna to join a clash of codw?
 LeBaoHoang8A4: *code
 JBM: BAN
 LeBaoHoang8A4: PLEASE NO
 LeBaoHoang8A4: HAHAHA
 Scarfield: oof, you are new here. Clash of code is not popular among regular users&#160;;)
 LeBaoHoang8A4: yeah i know
 LeBaoHoang8A4: just for fun
 JBM: it's not clash of code so much as talking about it in #general
 DomiKo: i will join!
 LeBaoHoang8A4: OH DOMIKO
 Scarfield: i have no issue with someone asking about it, but posting links can be annoying
 LeBaoHoang8A4: yep
 Astrobytes: Yep, send invites in PM
 JBM: to that euler guy
 TheSpiffiest: So one thing - when you do clash of code, share your code
 TheSpiffiest: Then others can learn from you.
 JBM: that part still is weird to me
 TheSpiffiest: DomiKo beat me by 30 characters, but we don't know what he did. Likely map/reduce tricks
 Astrobytes: Same.
 Astrobytes: Not very competitive if you all see each others code
 jacek: what if hes ashamed of his code
 DomiKo: which clash?
 jacek: as he should be
 TheSpiffiest: Ha! gotta protect those imaginary points you get here?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I solved the clashing problems by not clashing.
 JBM: indeed you do
 DomiKo: i have auto share option on my profile
 DomiKo: dont know we it didnt work
 Astrobytes: Think you gotta do it manually in clashes DomiKo
 Uljahn: it works for puzzles only
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/JkcvSm2.png">https://pasteboard.co/JkcvSm2.png</a>
 DomiKo: so this "view code" is fake
 DomiKo: good to know
 jacek: you can always see your code
 RoboStac: you can view it, but until you click the share button no-one else can
 Astrobytes: If you click share it activates it for otheres
 jacek: wait, we can choose not to share puzzle code?
 DomiKo: rly?
 Astrobytes: Yes jacek
 Astrobytes: Yes DomiKo
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: TheSpiffiest tranlate
 DomiKo: to can google it
 TheSpiffiest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/JkcwrIU.png">https://pasteboard.co/JkcwrIU.png</a>
 DomiKo: now you can see it
 DomiKo: i guess
 TheSpiffiest: Ah, cool.
 TheSpiffiest: Yeah see I had no idea that function existed.
 Uljahn: which one?
 TheSpiffiest: python3 - string  maketrans
 TheSpiffiest: But I know C, C++, Python, JAVA, Lua, C#, VB.NET, JavaScript, Ruby, R etc
 DomiKo: if you want do sth in python
 DomiKo: you must know one thing
 TheSpiffiest: So I suck in many languages
 DomiKo: there is a function for it
 TheSpiffiest: but I'm not great at any
 TheSpiffiest: Thank you for sharing DomiKo
 TheSpiffiest: I like this site over HackerRank because it saves my code.  I can solve the problem in Java, then go back and solve it in Ruby
 TheSpiffiest: HackerRank you solve the problem and the code gets deleted. 
 TheSpiffiest: This is educational, plus I love the visualization of the robots and drone games
 Astrobytes: It's a bit less dry than some other sites
 DomiKo: wow 
 DomiKo: hard faster clash
 DomiKo: math is hard
 DomiKo: can i report clash?
 DomiKo: or check if there is bug?
 dbdr: DomiKo: there is a button to report the clash
 dbdr: "I had a problem with this clash", sth like that
 DomiKo: yea i see
 jacek: you can give feedback
 DomiKo: oh yes i will
 DomiKo: clashes for fiding pattern in math problem
 DomiKo: is not cool
 TheSpiffiest: Interesting thing though Amazon asks you to take a test on HackerRank.com during their interview process
 TheSpiffiest: and google has used <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/">https://codeforces.com/</a>
 TheSpiffiest: Although they are kind of bizarre in their interview process. You'll be given problems that you can't possibly solve.
 Astrobytes: Google use leetcode too
 Astrobytes: Evaluating your approach to solving the problem no doubt
 TheSpiffiest: Yep. I've got interview 5 today so stuff like this is actually my homework
 DomiKo: i believe that they are using only easy/medium tasks from this sites
 TheSpiffiest: I feel like an idiot. I haven't done algorithms from scratch since Clinton was president.
 TheSpiffiest: because - you *don't* do it by hand. You just use new LinkedList&lt;int&gt; and be on your way
 DomiKo: if you consider LindedList as algoithms then i guess you are begginer
 TheSpiffiest: Heh, I don't know what I am. I've been programming since I'm 12, and I'm 42
 TheSpiffiest: it's more like at this point the terms blur together
 TheSpiffiest: I've done it, but I don't recall which is called what
 DomiKo: the wierd part about interviews is that you dont't really use algorithms 
 TheSpiffiest: depth first would or radix sort would be an algorithm and linked list a data type.  
 DomiKo: that you need to know
 DomiKo: for them
 TheSpiffiest: like what for example?
 DomiKo: have you seen interview with Erichto?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuPSibuIKIg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuPSibuIKIg</a>
 DomiKo: that question is not eaasy
 oetzi: no i havnt seen it
 oetzi: shall i?
 oetzi: *should 
 DomiKo: for me
 DomiKo: it was interesting to watch
 TheSpiffiest: Yes.  I watched a ton of those.
 xlr4829: js is not good for math
 TheSpiffiest: The funny thing is I'm not great at math, but I ship working code and am good at leading teams.
 TheSpiffiest: Oops - forgot I was in a code clash&#160;:) 7/8 and I timed out 
 Dlx: why are someone noob if they consider LinkList an algorithm @domino? LinkList is a perfect example of an algorithm and even part of the base libraries of most languages, so I have no idea what you are babling on about and calling others noob. That was rude!
 DomiKo: i didn't sad noob
 Dlx: @domiko that is
 DomiKo: just a begginer
 Dlx: still
 DomiKo: in can of inteview in google
 DomiKo: in case*
 Dlx: why don't you consider linked list and implementations there of, as algorithms???
 Putnam3145: linked lists are data structures
 Astrobytes: Possibly because they are data structures...
 SPDene: nice DomiKo. I should have had the advantage on that one (I approved it this morning), but I completely forgot how to do it!
 Dlx: linked list, yes sure, but in "all" languages you have classes with supported operations, and I'm pretty sure that's what he was talking about
 DomiKo: what I meant is that you need to know something more complex
 DomiKo: than LinkedList
 Dlx: LinkedLIst, not linked list, is a clas
 DomiKo: SPDene nice bracket case
 DomiKo: i didn't know about brackets and added one by one
 DomiKo: a lot of testing...
 Astrobytes: Dlx: I believe DomiKo was referring to the the fact that in some cases you need to know the underlying implementation of a LinkedList 
 Astrobytes: How to construct the data structure, which algorithms to use for insertion etc
 Scarfield: and anyway he obviously didnt mean to offend, neither was  Spiff offended, so.. Just keep it civil 
 Astrobytes: Quite. No need to jump off the deep end when we can just discuss like adults.
 AntiSquid: very warm outside wow
 Scarfield: xD
 DomiKo: haha
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a nice day
 DomiKo: that's what happend if you clash to much
 Scarfield: "And now for something comepletely different"
 DomiKo: :yoy:
 Scarfield: :yoyo:
 SPDene: it's nearly 30C here -it's HORRIBLE
 AntiSquid: ok i am slow, didn't notice any uncivil chat *confused*
 SPDene: nor me
 Astrobytes: I miss living in London 34-37 degree days, amazing
 DomiKo: where you live now?
 SPDene: yeah - that's pure torture for me. give me 10-15 any day
 Astrobytes: Back home in Scotland
 AntiSquid: next to the loch ness monster
 Astrobytes: Quite far from Loch Ness
 DomiKo: Scotland rain rain rain
 Scarfield: i was smelling torches and hearing pitchforks rattle, but no need to ring the alarm :p
 AntiSquid: that's basically all of UK DomiKo
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we get a lot DomiKo
 AntiSquid: well this area anyway
 DomiKo: I was there once
 DomiKo: and the felling 
 DomiKo: when i go to shop
 DomiKo: 10 min
 DomiKo: go outside
 DomiKo: hmmm
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: You get used to it. I hate it but you get used to it.
 DomiKo: 3 min rain every 15 min
 DomiKo: its weird
 Scarfield: apparently you can have 4 seasons of weather in 1 day in scotland
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: in 4 minutes or less if you're in the hills or mountains
 AntiSquid: anyone heard about this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/2kA0-UmNbPg?t=81">https://youtu.be/2kA0-UmNbPg?t=81</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah some Dutch guy floated the proposal earlier this year
 Astrobytes: I'm not entirely convinced
 DomiKo: wait what
 Scarfield: in doesnt float well.. badum ts
 AntiSquid: it's a dutch thing of course you wouldn't understand
 Astrobytes: Yes Scarfield, you took that to it's natural conclusion&#160;;)
 Scarfield: there is already a line somewhere, a direct train from paris to london is a thing afaik
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: but that's underwater
 Astrobytes: The channel tunnel
 AntiSquid: wait it's that what it's called? i forgot
 AntiSquid: weird name
 Astrobytes: It's a tunnel under the English Channel...
 Scarfield: lol, i assumed (wrongly as ever) that these were tunnels xD
 AntiSquid: nah someone wants to build a massive dam
 AntiSquid: worried London and other cities might flood
 Allis: They should call it the Dayum Dam.
 Astrobytes: We just need massive beavers to build it
 AntiSquid: could genetically engineer some
 Scarfield: xD
 Allis: Genetically engineer some dams?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoroides">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoroides</a>
 Scarfield: skips the beaver part
 Astrobytes: Giant beavers
 Bob: *must not get mental image*
 Scarfield: must. resist. the. puns..
 Astrobytes: Bob, was just waiting for that :grin:
 AntiSquid: nitpicking on semantics, but some SF books have genetically engineered space ships, so ...
 AntiSquid: Allison
 Bob: *epic fail*
 Bob: :see_no_evil:
 AntiSquid: oh there's allis and allison, so if i ping allison i ping both?
 Bob: there goes my weekend
 Allis: AntiSquid: That wasn't the best test case.
 dbdr: RustyGhostFromHell_ec10, pretty good user name, why change it? :D
 Allis: But no, thankfully I didn't get pinged when your post only contained "Allison".
 Allis: The power of \b.
 AntiSquid: i could rename to Automaton20000 so Automaton2000 also gets pinged
 Automaton2000: what league are you in?
 Scarfield: you dont gent pinged like this AntiSquido
 AntiSquid: oh weird
 Allis: Not too weird; it probably matches the message against /\byourname\b/i or some such.
 dbdr: AntiโSquid
 Dlx: is there a way to 'store' a clash as a favourite and replay it, or invite friends to play it???
 Scarfield: if you make a private clash i think you can choose the clash, but i dont know how it works, never did it
 xlr4829: i can win this time
 Sooran: Hello~
 Dlx: cool scarfield. will try that, thanks
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Not sure you can choose the actual clash itself, but you can choose the type and the language in a private one for sure
 Putnam3145: looking at my code and realizing that what I was doing made no sense, but was working anyway
 Putnam3145: baffled
 Astrobytes: time for a screen break&#160;;)
 DomiKo: nashhhh
 DomiKo: 222 in CSB
 DomiKo: still a lot to work
 Astrobytes: gg, you were 600-ish earlier on first submit right?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: in gold max thrust was 100
 DomiKo: there is 200
 Astrobytes: hehe yeah 
 DomiKo: my boost was 200...
 OwenGaming: Hi im new to coding! :hand_splayed:
 DomiKo: so i was slow as f...
 DomiKo: hi man
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 DomiKo: maybe top200 right now
 Astrobytes: Hi new to coding!&#160;:)
 DomiKo: winrate looking good
 DomiKo: :joy:
 OwenGaming: yes i am and if only played the tutorial
 Astrobytes: Onboarding or the pod racing?
 OwenGaming: Idk what you mean im sorry
 Astrobytes: The tutorials
 Astrobytes: that you played
 OwenGaming: onboarding
 AntiSquid: just build a dam around astro, he'll stop bothering you then
 Astrobytes: Cool, I would suggest continuing with the easy puzzles and ignoring Anti Squid for an easier life :P
 OwenGaming: Ok i wont ignore both of you
 OwenGaming: :joy:
 Astrobytes: lol
 DomiKo: lmao
 xlr4829: oh shit here we go again 
 xlr4829: second place common
 Astrobytes: Get first!
 Dlx: is it only me who wants to complete every clash even if I loose/time out? Completeion geene I guess... 
 Dlx: is there some other activity that is good for 10-20 minutes??? 
 Allis: Rubik's Cube?
 Dlx: chekcing&#160;:) thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Sure, some of the easy (and possibly medium depending on your expertise) can be solved in 10-20 mins
 Astrobytes: *puzzles I mean
 Allis: Oh, sorry; I meant solving Rubik's Cube for 10-20 minutes to pass the time.
 Allis: I think I misunderstood your question.
 Dlx: haha&#160;:) 
 Dlx: I was looking hard for it  ;P
 Astrobytes: There are a couple of Rubik's puzzles
 Allis: Well, sort of.
 Astrobytes: yeah
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/rubik%C2%AE">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/rubik%C2%AE</a>
 Allis: That one's all math and has nothing to do with the mechanism of a Rubik's cube, though.
 dbdr: rubik's cube IS math&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ^
 Allis: It's definitely not.
 Allis: Or, well, doesn't have to be.
 Allis: I'm a speedcuber.&#160;:)
 dbdr: need to fight JBM
 Astrobytes: Yeah, double stream, cube vs cube
 Allis: I average high 14s, so I'm not crazy-fast, but I do enjoy meeting other cubers.
 dbdr: ^
 dbdr: cubung with one hand, coding with the other
 dbdr: *clashing
 Allis: I've done that. :sweat_smile:
 el19oc: I'm not allowed near anything cuboid in shape
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 el19oc: not since the accident...
 dbdr: like the earth?
 Logiman09: (โฏยฐโกยฐ๏ผโฏ๏ธต โปโโป
 dbdr: oops, revealed myself as a cube-earther
 Astrobytes: a cube-earther
 Astrobytes: That's a thing now?
 dbdr: why would flat and round be the only two options?
 MSmits: the Earth is Tetrahedron!!!
 JBM: til proven otherwise
 Allis: It's a torus.
 Astrobytes: Everyone knows it's a teapot
 el19oc: it's a tortoise
 Allis: It's toroidal tortoises all the way up.
 Allis: (But also flat.)
 Astrobytes: and gas all the way down
 dbdr: ^
 dbdr: v
 dbdr: which way is down?
 Allis: Thataway.
 Astrobytes: Depends on your perspective
 el19oc: head upward, but the other way
 dbdr: trick to remember: when your hand's palms are facing down, your left hand is the one with the thumb on the right
 MSmits: and your right hand is the one with the thumb on the left?
 JBM: how'd you guess
 MSmits: I extrapolated
 dbdr: ^ genius
 dbdr: never mix them up again
 MSmits: it's water tight
 MSmits: and airtight
 DomiKo: beaten euler in CSB job done
 JBM: nwo clash him
 Scarfield: hmm i just put by hands on the table, and seemingly both right and left is toward myself :thinking:
 MSmits: weirdly shaped table
 el19oc: how do you tell your hands from your feet
 dbdr: weirdly shaped self?
 Astrobytes: weirdly shaped hands
 MSmits: just say
 MSmits: Get away from my feet
 MSmits: you hands!
 dbdr: maybe the space is curved
 dbdr: any blackhole in the neighbourhood?
 Scarfield: ----   ----
 Scarfield: lol
 MSmits: why are you showing us your church layout
 Scarfield: fingers pointing at each other
 MSmits: seems you are sitting close to the exit
 Astrobytes: In case of black holes obviously
 Scarfield: hit &lt; insted of shift when creating newline, was about to make line art to show my hands
 el19oc: always ready to make a quick getaway
 el19oc: I like it
 Scarfield: :point_right: :point_left:
 Astrobytes: Failfield
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: like that, but palms down, pun unintended :p
 MSmits: you're working real hard to tell us what your hands are doing :confused:
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: dbdr confessed to me earlier he is doing this on purpose
 MSmits: so we dont break his nr 1's 
 MSmits: keep us busy
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: remember that ascii game from last night?
 MSmits: that was part of the strategy
 Astrobytes: never underestimate a multitasker (pun intended)
 Astrobytes: lol yeah
 dbdr: what's the intended pun?
 Logiman09: what is the easiest type of code for coders strike back?
 MSmits: working on multis
 MSmits: while being distracted by you
 MSmits: that's the pun
 Astrobytes: aka multi-tasker
 dbdr: ah, multi
 dbdr: :D
 Logiman09: what is the easiest type of code for coders strike back?
 dbdr: -3vel
 MSmits: Logiman09 mostly we use ascii
 Astrobytes: It's not the same when you have to explain it!
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 dbdr: gg, Astrobytes
 dbdr: MSmits: you realize if I have to keep animating the chat, it defeats the purpose, since I can't improve either
 dbdr: conclusion, you're talking to a dbdr bot
 Scarfield: :O
 Scarfield: its self aware
 Logiman09: MSmits ascii does not apear as a choice
 dbdr: no need, the chat is quite predictable
 dbdr: just react to a few keywords and it's above the average level of coherence
 dbdr: Logiman09: you mean programming language?
 dbdr: which ones do you know?
 Scarfield: Logiman09 the -3vel was actually a strat for CSB, subtract 3*vx from target x of next check point
 Scarfield: same for y
 Astrobytes: Though that has to be one of the greatest responses ever
 MSmits: hmm what if we have always talked to the dbdr bot
 dbdr: what if there is no dbdr
 Logiman09: I don't know any. I have been practicing with JavaScript but I am not very good with it
 MSmits: me neither
 el19oc: then who made the dbdr chat bot
 Scarfield: i am suspecting you have just submitted some code dbdr?
 dbdr: it made itself
 Scarfield: xD
 dbdr: ML, obviously
 dbdr: why do you think there are chat logs?
 Scarfield: Cogito ergo sum
 dbdr: the automatons were just earlier, more primitive attempts
 dbdr: Scarfield: submitted?
 Scarfield: waiting for submit to finish -&gt; more time to distract in chat
 Scarfield: or more computational power to do so, since the bot is no longer coding
 Astrobytes: As the famous philosopher Cyberpunk once said: Good coder is 10% talent and 90% not being distracted by chat.
 dbdr: my submits are automated too
 dbdr: (true story)
 Scarfield: this statement is false
 Astrobytes: Thanks for letting us know.
 Scarfield: testing if dbdrBot would "non sequitor"
 Scarfield: i think we are safe
 Astrobytes: heh
 el19oc: he's learning
 el19oc: pretty soon he will be indistinguishable from a real human being
 dbdr: ๐คฏ
 jacek: .exec 'rm -rf /*'
 AntiSquid: you can do few multis and pass wood league
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll
 AntiSquid: it's like time travel
 JBM: but cheaper
 Putnam3145: okay so like
 Putnam3145: are the leagues "fake" or something
 el19oc: yes, it's all a conspiracy
 Astrobytes: There are no leagues.
 Putnam3145: never have been
 el19oc: this whole website exists so that the dbdrbot can learn from the chat
 Astrobytes: What do you mean anyway?
 Astrobytes: regarding the leagues
 Putnam3145: like, are they... actually indicative of real players I'm beating
 SPDene: Astrobytes did you look in the sea. I heard there were 20,000 of them under there :P
 Astrobytes: SPDene dear oh dear :D
 Astrobytes: Well, they are all bots submitted by someone at some point Putnam3145
 Putnam3145: okay the 30 minute promotion is making me suspect it's real--yeah okay
 Putnam3145: sorry i just got to silver league after like... two hours?
 Putnam3145: so i was like "hey wait a minute"
 Astrobytes: Whether the users are still active or not... some are, some aren't
 Astrobytes: Yeah there's a delay sometimes
 Putnam3145: then again all the bots in bronze league seem, uh, fantastically simple
 Astrobytes: They are&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: It gets harder, I assure you
 el19oc: most of the competition happens in the higher leagues
 Putnam3145: like i didn't see anything basic like adjusting while keeping up thrust to go in a straight line or whatever you call that
 Putnam3145: newton
 Astrobytes: There's not much needed for the lower leagues in CSB
 Astrobytes: The input changes in gold btw
 Putnam3145: oh, fun
 Putnam3145: i'm using complex numbers for coordinates cause they're the only thing in this language that has built-in angles support. it's kinda silly
 Scarfield: sin(), cos(), tan()&#160;?
 Putnam3145: and you can just use z.arg to get the angle of that particular complex number
 Putnam3145: very helpful
 Scarfield: sure, but i doubt that there are not built in sin() etc?
 Putnam3145: there are
 Putnam3145: just easier to use complex numbers cause i'm too cool for normal vectors or whatever
 AlmostM: is there a way to turn off auto-creation of close quotes and close brackets?
 Astrobytes: AlmostM Settings on the left
 AlmostM: thanks!
 Astrobytes: no problem 
 trictrac: gg Astrobytes go13x13 is for now
 Astrobytes: thx trictrac, not quite there yet!  should probably implement a search now
 Astrobytes: well, in the next league I mean
 trictrac: Your winning rate is good against the boss It will be good 
 Astrobytes: Just not quite consistent enough
 trictrac: Sure it will be tonight
 Astrobytes: Planning on it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Nice rank btw!
 AntiSquid: what game?
 AntiSquid: ah that weird go variant
 jacek: The Game
 Putnam3145: oh wow
 Putnam3145: i'm in gold league now
 Putnam3145: fun fun
 Astrobytes: good job Putnam3145
 Putnam3145: oh, nice, you actually get checkpoints now
 Putnam3145: before I was storing them as I got to them, then if it found a familiar one it'd start using that info to plan ahead more
 Putnam3145: getting speed vector and angle are nice
 Putnam3145: i was... also calculating those before
 Putnam3145: i might've gone overkill
 Hankdane: I kind of gave up on that competition, because I got some strange results when I was trying to counter drift.
 AntiSquid: always some bug in the code ^
 AntiSquid: easy to overlook
 Putnam3145: my experience with that was
 Putnam3145: terrible, terrible angle stuff
 Putnam3145: negative radians are and have always been a bad idea
 Putnam3145: well okay
 Putnam3145: they're fine
 Putnam3145: something was causing them to act super weird
 Hankdane: That's what I found.
 Hankdane: It looked like I successfully countered my drift, then the drift would get worse on the next 'tick'.
 Hankdane: That didn't make sense.
 Hankdane: I mean, I would get my angle to 0 or 1, then it would jump to 14 or so.
 Hankdane: Which is fine and can happen, except it was worse than the 'normal' path (not using counter-drift logic).
 Hankdane: If there was a bug in my counter-drift logic, it would make sense to get worse. Not better first, then worse.
 Hankdane: It wasn't a case of over-shooting either, the angle was getting worse in the same direction, not the opposite.
 Razhan13: Hi
 johantenhouten: if line
 johantenhouten: closet_dist
 BaRNiii: hello, is ther anyoen who can help me with coders strike back&#160;?
 DomiKo: go ahead
 johantenhouten: what is coders strike back?
 DomiKo: I'm currenty doing it
 DomiKo: ask anything
 DomiKo: Bot proggraming
 BaRNiii: i am stuck in the begining of the bronze
 BaRNiii: how shoudl i improve my pod to beat the first level of the bronze&#160;?
 DomiKo: print x, y of next checpoint and 100 thrust?
 BaRNiii: and trying to slow down before the checkpoint to avoid drift but i think it isnt good enough
 DomiKo: i know there is simple strat without slowing down
 DomiKo: that can reach gold
 Putnam3145: slow down how much though
 DomiKo: so maybe try to
 DomiKo: consider current speed
 DomiKo: to make drift
 Putnam3145: you have to calculate speed
 BaRNiii: thrust = 100 - (80 - nextCheckpointDist/100);  
 Putnam3145: which, like, I did to reach gold, but it's not the most trivial of things
 BaRNiii: with this i slow to 20 when i reach the checkpoint isnt it&#160;?
 Putnam3145: that's probably too much
 DomiKo: slowing isn't the best
 Putnam3145: unless you're pre-turning, which you probably aren't
 Astrobytes: there's a very trivial solution but I won't give it to you
 Putnam3145: unless you're doing something weird
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: don't give it
 BaRNiii: :D
 DomiKo: i have it too
 Putnam3145: it's POSSIBLE, and I did it, but you don't have to
 DomiKo: one liner to gold
 DomiKo: but that's not fun
 DomiKo: i am
 DomiKo: try to maybe watch your car
 DomiKo: how it's drifting
 DomiKo: like when you have high speed
 DomiKo: and you go in straing line to checkpoint
 DomiKo: that could be not the best idea
 Astrobytes: think about taking the checkpoint into consideration, relative to your velocity, and where you intend to go after
 BaRNiii: what do you mean&#160;?
 BaRNiii: i dont know the next checkpoint until i reach the current 
 BaRNiii: i know onlt next checkpont coordinates, distance, angle, and the enemy pod cordinates
 Astrobytes: Relate what I said to what DomiKo said
 Andriamanitra: i guess you could remember checkpoints from first lap
 Astrobytes: Yes, you can indeed
 BaRNiii: i dont get it :S
 Astrobytes: Take your time and watch the pods
 Astrobytes: change a few variables and look at the effects
 Scarfield: your pod changes direction somehow, consider what is a good point to aim at
 Andriamanitra: is the ranking after submit my ranking in my current league or global?
 DomiKo: league
 DomiKo: you can check leaderboard for global rating
 BaRNiii: should i avoid crash somehow with the other pod&#160;?
 johantenhouten: e,ee
 DomiKo: no
 DomiKo: nobody will do that
 DomiKo: right now
 DomiKo: try to do the run as fast as you can
 DomiKo: image that there is no enemy
 DomiKo: imagine*
 BaRNiii: okay 
 BaRNiii: i am currently trying to figure it out how to avoid drifting away
 DomiKo: drift is kinda cool
 Astrobytes: USE the drift!
 BaRNiii: :D
 Astrobytes: Really.
 BaRNiii: so should i set the next checkpoint cordinate to the right or to the left denpends on the turn for the next checkpoint 
 BaRNiii:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: - 2.98  * velocity
 BaRNiii: thats the magic value&#160;? :D
 Illedan: Play Search Race to look more into the driving itself
 Illedan: ;D
 BaRNiii: where is that&#160;?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/search-race</a>

 BaRNiii: it is turning only right
 Illedan: Yeah, my car is not the best driver :P 
 BaRNiii: :D:D
 DomiKo: Hi Illedan
 Illedan: hi
 DomiKo: i was trying you game
 Illedan: Search Race?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: and i mean
 DomiKo: it's really hard
 Illedan: You are close though
 Illedan: 98&#160;%
 DomiKo: i can easly pass all cases
 DomiKo: but validators
 DomiKo: ...
 Illedan: Do you simulate the game?
 DomiKo: so hard
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: GA right now
 Illedan: How long time are you using?
 Illedan: 45 ms?
 DomiKo: from 25 to 48
 DomiKo: changed from submit to submit
 Illedan: Use at max 35
 Illedan: No idea why
 DomiKo: yea i read the forum
 Illedan:&#160;:+1:
 DomiKo: then my&#160;% is like 90%+
 Illedan: Do you save the maximal used time during a game, just to verify you never use more than 35 ms?
 Illedan: If you have loops doing multiple runs before checking the time
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: that could be useful
 DomiKo: i will try it
 Putnam3145: i'm the only person who's ever done roller coaster in D&#160;:(
 JBM: gg
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: 100% Search race
 DomiKo: finally
 JBM: gg
 JBM: wait do i know other words?
 Allison: No
 JBM: oh yes, thank me
 Allison: I think you're just stringing letters along in a way that looks pleasant, but you don't actually know what they mean. :P
 JBM: isn't that the point?
 Allison: I'm not sure...  I wonder if I do the same thing sometimes.
 JBM: your opinion Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: and you will see a score column
 JBM: well said
 Putnam3145: good lord it's absolutely convined i'm a bot
 Allis: Convined?
 Allis: Oh, I see. Do you mean the Clash captcha?
 Putnam3145: convinced
 Putnam3145: and yeah
 Putnam3145: why is it getting HARDER
 Allis: It ramps up the more it thinks you're a bot, which is determined by a combination of frequency (how often you're playing) and the accuracy of your answers.
 Allis: I do think they should just limit it to the simple "not a bot" button for users who are clearly not bots.
 ARUINY: Does anyone know where to see the original codes in STDIN?
 MateusKarvat: at the upper right corner of the "test cases" box, there's a menu button. Click on it and you'll be able to see all tests
 MateusKarvat: I hope that's what you were asking about
 ARUINY: Thanks @MateusKarvat . But did not find a menu button at the right upper corner. I am in game The Decent.
 ARUINY: Screen Shot 2020-08-01 at 10.43.33.jpg

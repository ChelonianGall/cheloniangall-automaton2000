 UnnamedCodinGamer: stupid question: is there any interaction between the car and the check points in search race or collision means that the car cleared the check point?
 Programmer69420: :fried_shrimp:
 struct: What do you mean UnnamedCodinGamer?
 struct: by interaction
 Astrobytes: does it bounce etc 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: that the car bumps into the check point and changes its path
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 Astrobytes: It doesn't
 UnnamedCodinGamer: ok
 UnnamedCodinGamer: there was some part in called "check collisions"
 BrainNotFoundException: meow
 UnnamedCodinGamer: so they are not real collisions then
 struct: its just to get the time it will take to enter the checkpoint range
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's not like CSB in that regard
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: Strictly speaking a collision is when two objects overlap, no consequences are required...
 UnnamedCodinGamer: well
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: in a physics based game it might be expected to be more than that
 derjack: physics :nauseated_face:
 BlaiseEbuth: I suppose it depends if you're speaking from the geometric point of view or the physic one...
 Astrobytes: It does yeah

 MSmits: I'll just scare away some of the spammers by talking about meta mcts, thats always fun
 Astrobytes: Join us

 MSmits: hf, let me know how it goes
 struct: It was better than I expected
 MSmits: whats fun about it?
 Astrobytes: ^
 struct: cooperation 
 Astrobytes: Some of the puzzles were actually fun to solve as a team
 MSmits: hmm ok, the only cooperative programming i have been apart of was google hashcode
 MSmits: i always feel pretty useless at those
 MSmits: ille dan and euler dominating the show mostly
 struct: the problems are very simple
 Astrobytes: There's not a great deal of programming required tbh
 MSmits: hmm ok
 derjack: isnt this like clash with extra steps
 Astrobytes: No, not really
 Astrobytes: I mean you don't cooperate in clashes, there's no adversary in these other than the puzzles
 derjack: meh
 Astrobytes: you would just troll your team members anyway :P
 MSmits: this could be helpful
 MSmits: added challenge
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: oh I passed my thesis!
 Astrobytes: eyyyy well done man
 MSmits: barely passing grade but I don't care, it's done
 MSmits: I have good grades for the programming stuff, but didactic thesis is different
 Astrobytes: A pass is a pass is a pass
 MSmits: yeah!
 Astrobytes: What's next?
 MSmits: just need to write an internship report, or however you translate it
 MSmits: technically i intern as a CS teacher

 <b>**BrainNotFoundException :wink:</b>
 struct: MSmits what are you working on atm?
 MSmits: the big long term project is a oware NN probably, but i need to work out how to generate positions to train on and use TF with that, and marchetes mokka
 MSmits: other than that i want to code a multithread version of my meta mcts
 Astrobytes: finally :P
 MSmits: yeah i have 10 cores now and running 5 meta mcts. It's easier to just run one at a time and use 5-7 cores for it, running in the background
 Astrobytes: Far easier, yes
 MSmits: only time i ever did multithreading is with Numbershifting
 Astrobytes: oh, didn't know you did it for NS
 MSmits: yeah I think i used 2 cores
 MSmits: but never went beyond dancing links, so got stuck on early 200s
 Astrobytes: ah right
 MSmits: thinking about how to make sure the games running dont mess up the tree. Need to lock a node somehow so another selection process wont choose the same node to run a game from
 MSmits: games are between 50 ms and 3 seconds
 MSmits: and there's solving on solved games
 derjack: parallel mcts, tree paralelization with local mutexes
 derjack: and virtual losses
 MSmits: are you giving me google search words?
 derjack: well yes
 MSmits: cool thanks&#160;:)
 derjack: but this is what i use for parallel mcts
 Astrobytes: Yeah that sounds appropriate
 derjack: it mostly resembles the single threaded mcts tree with more time
 MSmits: hmm well that's the idea
 MSmits: but is it compatible with meta mcts?
 MSmits: i start new proceses
 MSmits: using a C# program, starting C++ games
 derjack: dunno. during selection, if node is selected, you set mutex, you set virtual loss, then release mutex and go deeper
 derjack: virtual loss is to discourage many threads to go into the same path
 MSmits: ohhh i thought of that!
 <b>**Alex-1 what is Brain F**k</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: i was thinking just add a visit
 derjack: or add visit
 MSmits: mutex is a thingy that locks a node?
 derjack: yes. yet another variable in node
 MSmits: i can imagine getting to a parent of which all children are leafs. If you lock one you can pick one of the others, but what if all children are locked?
 derjack: then you wait till someone is free
 derjack: but at this parent parent should have many virtual visits (and/or losses) so it shouldnt be chosen unless its really good
 derjack: at this point*
 derjack: some locking and waiting for unlocking is unavoidable
 derjack: or just google that and see what free papers will say about it
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: makes sense
 MSmits: i know what to do then, just matter of working out how to do this properly in C#
 derjack: should have thought of that in the beginning of winter though
 MSmits: wouldnt matter
 MSmits: i was already running meta mcts pretty hard
 MSmits: probably using a net 6 cores
 MSmits: I just want to focus on 1 of them, prolly uttt for my opening book experiment
 derjack: i never used it for meta but should be the same. except you probably also care about transpositions and rotations, so i dont know now how to work with them in multi threaded way
 MSmits: I dont think that matters at all. Every node is rotated and mirrored to the lowest possible state every time a move is made
 MSmits: so transpositions are automatically taken care of
 MSmits: its just part of ApplyMove()
 MSmits: so say i am doing othello. Whenever I make a move, i look at the new board, check all 8 transpositons and change the current board to the lowest one (taking the state as integers)
 derjack: ahh you have state in a node
 MSmits: thats the key in my node dictionary
 MSmits: i dont have a list or array, it's a giant dictionary
 MSmits: so there isnt even any tree actually. Every time children are being generated, it checks the dictionary to see if the nodes already exist
 MSmits: and otherwise it adds them
 struct: how fast is the dictionary?
 derjack: how do you backpropagate if child has few parents
 MSmits: just the ones for that selection route 
 MSmits: which leads to weird situations
 MSmits: but i accept this
 MSmits: struct it's probably slow as hell, but the meta mcts part of the program is allowed to be slow
 MSmits: the dictionary is a persistant dictionary saved on SSD
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/microsoft/ManagedEsent/blob/master/Documentation/PersistentDictionaryDocumentation.md">https://github.com/microsoft/ManagedEsent/blob/master/Documentation/PersistentDictionaryDocumentation.md</a>
 MSmits: it's a very convenient alternative for a database
 MSmits: same speed as a real DB, just very limited in what you can save
 MSmits: just strings and simple structs
 MSmits: I almost always use GUID
 MSmits: which is a 128 bit int 
 MSmits: i use it as a key/value pair so 128 bit to 128 bit
 MSmits: state is key, value is wins/visits etc.

 ZarthaxX: i know eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: read the rules, at least not so complicated
 ZarthaxX: but well, it's like a hs with sometweaks
 eulerscheZahl: did the rules even say anything about collisions? did I just miss that part?
 Q12: Hi BlaiseEbuth, I tried to listen to your advice and be in place 76 instead of 77 but I just can't because I am already in place 57  :grinning:
 jacek: ban
 eulerscheZahl: do that during the contest and you'll be back to 77 soon enough

 DetoBot: Nice
 VizGhar: any conspiracies around upcoming contest? 
 WesCraterMadman: It's designed by the mole people
 VizGhar: are those friendly?
 WesCraterMadman: sometimes
 WesCraterMadman: depends on your feelings on worms
 DetoBot: Well, it has been a week since it was started
 WesCraterMadman: you just made me panic and check if the contest had already started without me noticing
 DetoBot: :confused:
 VizGhar: :D :D no no. I was just wondering. Before last contest I was able to guess game type... now I have no idea
 DetoBot: that seems like an innovative way to learn programming and motivate logic building
 WesCraterMadman: I've never done a contest on here before, so I have no guesses whatsoever
 DetoBot: Good luck then
 VizGhar: hope you at least tried some bot programming here
 WesCraterMadman: haha yeah I'
 WesCraterMadman: ve done a bit
 VizGhar: Also I hope you will have some free time :D
 aetrnm: Oh, I remember good old days in LoL
 VizGhar: I've had basically none during last one and it shows... 4hrs of codind in total... reach silver and that was it
 DetoBot: An scary idea for the next contest
 DetoBot: "Create a program to fight in Coding Escape"
 DetoBot: It's much more interactive, amusing and exiting in many a ways

 Sakib62: loving this site
 King_Coda: me too
 King_Coda: this site is, as the cool kids say, "poggers"
 WannaBeHum1n: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 WannaBeHum1n: what is causing this
 WannaBeHum1n: i am pretty sure 
 WannaBeHum1n: i read the data
 Astrobytes: printing twice?
 WesCraterMadman: Usually you're printing something somewhere the game didn't expect it
 WesCraterMadman: Or you printed before it finished giving you info
 King_Coda: wasd
 WannaBeHum1n: ty
 King_Coda: oh wow
 King_Coda: if you press the up arrow on your keyboard it auto copies that last thing you said in chat
 King_Coda: if you press the up arrow on your keyboard it auto copies that last thing you said in chat

 King_Coda: maybe next year
 WannaBeHum1n: guys the nextCheckPointid var is local inside the for loop how do i use it outside it to print where the pod goes
 Astrobytes: use a variable outside the loop to store it?
 WannaBeHum1n: outside the game loop od would it be enough ouside the for loop of the pod
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: sorry
 WannaBeHum1n: i am using this to learn
 WannaBeHum1n: outside the game loop or the pod's for loop
 WannaBeHum1n: had a stroke reading the 1st msg

 WesCraterMadman: that's the one I was thinking of
 King_Coda: I hate that one the most
 Roxxx: my pod is circling around the starting area, not moving towards checkpoint at all
 WesCraterMadman: King_Coda why?
 WannaBeHum1n: Roxxx
 Roxxx: even though i can see that the program takes the coords of the checkpoint 
 King_Coda: Because it makes no sense!
 Roxxx: with a scanner

 Roxxx: java
 WesCraterMadman: I think wood

 Gabbek: thank you very much&#160;:)
 Gabbek: hmm, where can I see your bot?
 Astrobytes: Gabbek: I'm attempting to make a boss for struct, so my current bot is designed to beat random bots
 Gabbek: I see, so something just slighty better than random bot someone would create to see how the game plays out?
 Butanium: In everygame which look likes a board game there is trictrac on the top x)
 Astrobytes: Just to filter out the non-serious competitors who just submit random and be done with it
 Astrobytes: For the next league that is
 Gabbek: So that would be Boss 1, the starting one?
 Astrobytes: Nope, my Astrobytes one
 Astrobytes: Not finalised yet, boss 1 is just random
 Westicles: Seems like the bot games are kind of in a rut
 Astrobytes: Oh, but yeah, my bot would be boss 1 yeah
 Astrobytes: How so Westicles
 Westicles: Another 8x8 board game?
 Gabbek: I'm more than happy to help - but currently I have nothing; should I prepare some random bot(s) and we test those against your boss?
 Westicles: You guys can do those in your sleep
 Astrobytes: It's been pending for a good while now Westicles, and not sure if you noticed but there is a hardcore of boardgame fans here :D
 Westicles: Yeah, because you are good at them :P
 Gabbek: Oh Westicles - congrats on level 40! New shiny color (hopefully it's new... haven't poked around lately ;p)
 Astrobytes: Gabbek: Just output "random"
 Butanium: If you want something else than boardgames I'll start doing marketing for clash of bots :joy:
 Astrobytes: An additional forum post was enough "extra marketing" tbh Butanium :P
 Gabbek: Astrobytes: sure, but I don't know how to access your boss&#160;:( the Boss 1 is spamming random as well :p
 Butanium: Was that too much astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Westicles: nah, I ain't that good, but they are a lot of fun
 Butanium: I saw that everyone was doing it
 Butanium: So I thought it was a good thing to do
 Astrobytes: You gotta submit Gabbek
 Butanium: if not I can still remove it &gt;&lt;
 Gabbek: okey, sure - submitting the default code then
 Astrobytes: Butanium: Everyone? No, When puzzles/multis are approved, a forum thread is created
 Butanium: oh ok
 Smelty: hiya
 Gabbek: Good evening
 Astrobytes: afk 2 mins 
 Butanium: I didn't realize that those game where already validated
 Butanium: I'll remove my post for now then&#160;!
 Gabbek: Astrobytes: I've submitted, 12/17
 Gabbek: so it seems yours is pretty safe - all random seem to be around ~14-15 points
 Gabbek: I'll do few more tries just for safety&#160;:)
 Butanium: Your AI easily beat random astro
 Astrobytes: Thanks Gabbek, appreciated
 Butanium: the 2 games I got against you were easy win for you
 Gabbek: I'll let you know once few more have finished - anyway... how are you? What are you up to lately?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Butanium: don't worry, all good, it's your first contrib.And thank you for testing as well
 Butanium: I guess you don't need the replay as far as boss is random too
 struct: replay will play with same seed
 struct: random will play the same
 Butanium: oh right
 Astrobytes: Gabbek: Not much. Slowly working on a couple of bots, here and there. Wanna try and get Amazons out, struct is kinda busy so I volunteered to make a boss.
 Astrobytes: what do you think struct?
 struct: I havent seen it play yet, but if it beats random its good
 Gabbek: hard to luckily play a game against yours - but so far random has lost all of them when it happened, so it looks pretty good
 struct: I just dont want to prevent players from submiting random
 Butanium: What are advanced strategy for this game?
 Butanium: Monte carlo?
 Astrobytes: Well, once in a while I draw against random struct
 struct: That is fine
 Astrobytes: Butanium I use a minimax with alpha-beta pruning, and for this bot LOTS of extra pruning
 Gabbek: I've been trying to get to gold in all official games, but lately I came back to UTTT - I thought: a year has passed... clearly should be a bit better - wrote new thing from scratch; and the results are... it's exactly the same :D
 Gabbek: so far the best random submit is 8/18; 16.5 point
 Gabbek: and you're with 21.5 - pretty huge lead I think&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: yeah it seems fine, thanks a lot Gabbek, much appreciated
 Butanium: Astrobytes ok interesting
 Gabbek: np&#160;:) at the start I couldnt figure out how you want me to test it :D
 Butanium: I'll go to bed, good night coders
 Astrobytes: All good Gabbek, I just needed someone online to be able to give me feedback, the number of games on contributions is very low
 Astrobytes: Goodnight Butanium, see you later!
 struct: gn
 Gabbek: Good night!
 struct: Astro Ill add it maybe tomorrow?
 Astrobytes: Yes, let me tidy it up a little and I'll send it tomorrow at some point.
 Astrobytes: You want it obfuscated or not bothered?
 Gabbek: If you guys ever need help -- do poke me, please.
 Gabbek: I'm not really active on the chat, but a simple message on the discord or forums will do the trick, for sure&#160;:)
 struct: its your call
 therealbeef: anyone started on that coderone contest that began today?
 Astrobytes: Noted Gabbek, thank you&#160;:)
 struct: I registered then I opened their discord
 struct: and saw the feedback
 struct: was not so good
 therealbeef: same&#160;;-)
 therealbeef: seems a hassle to set up a toolchain
 struct: yeah
 struct: if I didnt have to setup docker I would have joined
 Astrobytes: I ain't too bothered struct, I'll put my code out there. Or maybe I should convert it to Haskell or something
 therealbeef: also they only has starter packs for python and some other language apparently, so for c++ you had to figure stuff out yourself
 Astrobytes: I think once docker is set up it's not so much of an issue, but as I said to euler earlier, it's an extra step you don't need
 therealbeef: and programmers are naturally lazy
 Astrobytes: It's why we write programs!
 struct: Also they mentioned possible changes iirc
 struct: I only read briefly
 therealbeef: in these first days yeah, like bugfixes or balance tweaks
 struct: how long is the competition?
 Astrobytes: What were the old perl virtues? Laziness, hubris and... I forget
 Astrobytes: Impatience, thank you google
 therealbeef: qualifiers 2 may, playoffs + finals 7 may, 
 Astrobytes: I'll hold out for mini-RAIC
 struct: maybe cg will be good, who knows
 therealbeef: how do contest usually do this? (maybe im spoiled with CG)
 Astrobytes: Not usually with docker
 therealbeef: is it usually just upload source code?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 struct: the windows update for dev channel is huge&#160;:(
 struct: But I really want to try the wsl thing
 Astrobytes: I mean, there are a bunch of contests that are just py or js or whatever, sometimes they have an option for hacking some other language in via some method or another.
 Astrobytes: CG is versatile, RAIC is versatile (be prepared for a strange API though), TC seems fine.
 Astrobytes: The new WSL thing seems amazing struct.
 struct: yeah
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: given the above complaints, CG is definitely the easiest to enter
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I gotta eat something again and sleep
 Gabbek: have a good evening&#160;:)
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: See you all tomorrow
 Astrobytes: gn
 Gabbek: see you, gn

 Smelty: xD
 Smelty: i've been tryin
 Smelty: I seem to play better then my bot
 Smelty: on the other hand, you have the seed..
 struct: what do you mean?
 Smelty: you know where the next tile is going to spawn
 Smelty: but I haven't really implemented it yet
 Smelty: ...basically, I haven't really tried building a good bot for this

 Lachrymosa: Hey I just solved the Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock problem and was wondering if someone could review the code and give me pointers on making it cleaner or if it is acceptable. I'm planning on doing bigger projects in the future and want to make sure I make smaller things with best practices to, well... practice.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lang?
 Lachrymosa: Python3
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not me sry
 Lachrymosa: np ty for offering
 WesCraterMadman:  Is there a built in debug tool? Or is it just debug mode?
 Lachrymosa: you can print stuff to an error stream to look at it and debug yourself, otherwise I think you need to tie the website to your own IDE
 Smelty: hhi
 WesCraterMadman: How would I print to an error stream? I've never done that before
 Lachrymosa: What language are you using?
 WesCraterMadman: Python3
 WesCraterMadman: I can look it up if there's a good place to go
 Lachrymosa: print(thingIWantToDebug,file=sys.stderr)
 WesCraterMadman: thanks
 Lachrymosa: just throw whatever you print into the standard error stream there, you can comma separate multiple things to check
 WesCraterMadman: I'm running into a weird issue, not sure if it's me doing something wrong. I'm working on CVZ, and the program stops right around the first time it does the inputs for the zombies
 WesCraterMadman: I can't get it to print beyond there
 Lachrymosa: If you throw it in a pastebin I may be able to debug it a bit, I haven't attempted this one though
 WesCraterMadman: I'd appreciate that
 WesCraterMadman: Gimme a sec
 WesCraterMadman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/pJZw1fHb">https://pastebin.com/pJZw1fHb</a>
 Lachrymosa: So here is something that may be useful to you, I commented out your section that checks if ash is none or not and then appends him to humans. Once I did I was able to get both zombie's information in test cases 2 and 3.  It seems like your code is just taking too much time . You need to do stuff in less than 100ms
 WesCraterMadman: dang
 WesCraterMadman: when does it start counting? Because if I can't even get through input theres nfw I can actually do calculations
 Lachrymosa: not sure why instantiating Ash is giving it so much grief
 Lachrymosa: I just had it list all the zombies and try to solve on 09 and it was just missing ash so it err'd
 Lachrymosa: weird. I put the ash bit back and it fails like you saw in the first 2, but if you try further down cases you still get all the zombies listed
 Lachrymosa: or most of them
 WesCraterMadman: Could it be a problem with low zombie count?
 WesCraterMadman: I'm not really sure what I can trim out in the beginning, unless initializing all my functions is a big time sink
 Lachrymosa: well like for case 15 there were 6 zombies but it only printed 0-4
 Lachrymosa: and again on 13 it says there are 14 zombies but prints 0-12
 Lachrymosa: so you keep missing the last one 
 Lachrymosa: not sure why
 WesCraterMadman: huh
 WesCraterMadman: it makes sense that the first one would freak out if it's missing the last zombie, since it only has the one
 WesCraterMadman: But it shouldn't take that long just to read in the information
 Lachrymosa: Sorry I couldn't be more help. I haven't been successful in simulating stuff so I'm not sure where the overhead is coming from
 WesCraterMadman: haha me neither
 WesCraterMadman: You've pointed me in the right direction, which is no small thing
 Lachrymosa: Well thats a plus :3
 Lachrymosa: As I said earlier, I'm trying to knock out easy puzzles with "best practices" structure and then move on up through the difficulties so that I can take on some larger projects I have in mind with actual clear and clean planning
 Lachrymosa: My mentor said good code is 90% planning and 10% coding
 WesCraterMadman: I started that way, but I got bored
 WesCraterMadman: Although now I'm frustrated, so not much of an upgrade
 Lachrymosa: I mean, I have a few bots kicking around bronze and one in silver. all without any simulation so I've been there :p
 Lachrymosa: I'm still gonna try on May 6th for the contest too even though I get blown out by the big fish lol
 WesCraterMadman: Me too! Good luck to you
 WesCraterMadman: I'm looking forward to getting absolutely punted
 Lachrymosa: If I make it out of wood, I call it a success :3
 JustnTime: Is there a way to do the Clash of Code challenges without a time limit? I kinda suck but love doing the puzzles
 WesCraterMadman: idk
 WesCraterMadman: you could always write them down and do it outside the ide
 WesCraterMadman: you'd have to manually check if you did it that way though
 Midnight2441: I don't think there is a way around the time barrier. Unless you can create a back door to the system, there is always a time limit.
 BigFatDecker: ok so this code was working then all of the sudden it just broke with no errors can someone help find the problem 
 BigFatDecker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/3swmsbaZ">https://pastebin.com/3swmsbaZ</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no query pause?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: btw, i know nothing of PY, especially this
 BigFatDecker: i thought that is what the r.pause threshold lol. It was working for about 2 hours then it just broke with no errors other then it can detect my voice
 BigFatDecker: cant
 WesCraterMadman: can you get someone with a different voice to try it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well if function call returns NULL on query ... test that
 BigFatDecker: sure i can try!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ISP or router firewall issue prolly
 BigFatDecker: you mean after the error i would return null instead of none correct?
 WesCraterMadman: Do you want to return the word None or a None object?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i have no idea of .recognizer return codes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i have a feeling try {} exception isn't catching because it shoudl return something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what does PY do on a print(NULL)?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: recognizer must timeout
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll shut up
 BigFatDecker: if that was the case would it work for awhile then crash? Could it be the microsoft api that im using for speech to text is having problems?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it depends on so many things, put in a test string i guess.  Somehow you got to test connectivity.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if it's saying hello, then the text to speech should be working
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google usually want you to set a developer id, stupid stuff like that
 BigFatDecker: yep it is saying hello just not picking up mic audio
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's ways around it, I've used some on google maps, but have no idea on sr
 BigFatDecker: i mightve just found the issue and i feel really dumb haha. My microphone went into powersave and shut off im not sure if this completely solved it yet haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, g/l  I'm no help anyways...Java on mobile much more complicated...so I would overcomplicate it as well
 BigFatDecker: no you were a lot of help and i really appreciate it

 ASM_MOV_INT: power options, never never
 hejamandajiri: set it to never sleep and unplug your input devices and the ports lol
 StevenV: Hello guys, do you guy know when will the green-circle got publised?
 StevenV: As It isn't in community contribute section anymore
 kovi: because it is in multiplay already
 GroutchKeu: o/
 SirGouki: as others have stated, you can set your power options to never sleep/hibernate or autoshutdown, then hold the windows key and press L to actually lock the computer.

 Westicles: It will be funny when every Friday they push an update and it reappears
 jacek: the chat will be available to everyone
 Uljahn: should be possible to make invite-only community xmpp server
 5DN1L: I think CG's concern is more about ongoing maintenance
 jacek: the ongoing what
 5DN1L: ongoing trolling :shrug:
 5DN1L: dedicated trolling to keep the chat alive
 5DN1L: or maybe i mean maintenance
 5DN1L: :shrug:
 jacek: :taco: 5DN1L
 jacek:&#160;:(
 5DN1L: thanks anyway&#160;:)
 Lavashyk: How to know the position of Thor?
 5DN1L: you get his initial position from inputs
 5DN1L: afterwards you have to keep track of it by yourself

 Automaton2000: had 2 energy drinks yesterday, feeling the drain
 jacek: oh my
 Joey_G: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i am new to coding
 AndreyXD: same
 AndreyXD: I am learning Python rn but wanna learn C
 NightScap3: RIP Chat
 NightScap3: Byebye
 jacek: C, python? quite different ;v
 TheRipperJack: yea, i recommend c++ for starting
 Joey_G: What does Automaton2000 think is the best way for starting?
 Automaton2000: so might not just be your bot
 AndreyXD: No worries, learning only python. C is hard for me rn lol
 therealbeef: the mirror match thingie is broken in the green circle multi. how do you report such bugs?
 Astrobytes: Devs are at a conference currently, we await their return to possibly add proper leagues and mirror matches
 eulerscheZahl: a firm wish, isn't it?
 Astrobytes: Yeah&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: the game remains crippled with so many top bots still missing
 eulerscheZahl: 82 in the arena. vs 1700 in the contest
 Astrobytes: Yes. Absolute travesty for such a nicely done game.
 darkhorse64: you nail it, euler, without the best, the incentive is mostly gone
 therealbeef: with only 90 matches and no mirror, and the first player advantage it's even more random at the moment
 eulerscheZahl: if i would have missed legend in the contest, i still had a goal to achieve within the final contest leaderboard as a starting point
 eulerscheZahl: now there is no such goal
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's what affects darkhorse and myself
 darkhorse64: ^
 eulerscheZahl: just another dead multiplayer arena now. even if you start a game from scratch, more players mean more fun as you have a better way to track your own progress
 eulerscheZahl: changed something, 50 ranks up. vs 1 or 2 up and not sure if random luck
 Astrobytes: Yes, exactly.
 Astrobytes: Corporate world sucks.
 eulerscheZahl: at least the Fr supremacy is gone. almost as many japanese players now
 JBM: heya eZ, astroes, westies o/
 Astrobytes: hey JBM, been a while&#160;:)
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: they will just open legend again and I will miss it again since it will be harder with even fewer bots
 Gangbi34567: which chanel is for invite
 Gangbi34567: whats the chanel name
 Astrobytes: Chanel #5
 darkhorse64: We have the PM now to help
 AliyTheEngineer: hi guys
 AliyTheEngineer: im new
 AliyTheEngineer: im beginner at js
 struct: I didnt enjoy the game that much to go back into it
 eulerscheZahl: What would be your strategy in the current Block the spreading fire puzzle event?How would you do in a Google-style interview based on the Wordle game?What do you think a coding problem from the World Championship Qualifiers look like? 
 struct: That question is for who eler?
 struct: euler*
 eulerscheZahl: i just got it in an email from CG
 AliyTheEngineer: how do i go to another test case
 eulerscheZahl: promoting their youtube <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Codingame">https://www.youtube.com/c/Codingame</a>
 AliyTheEngineer: like to the 2nd
 jacek: "Chat removal üí¨For maintenance reasons, we're sunsetting the integrated xmpp chat in favor of a unique place that part of the community already uses, Discord.Feel free to tell us what you think about the change in this forum thread."
 eulerscheZahl: what nice and positive words to describe this sad event
 AliyTheEngineer: aww man
 AliyTheEngineer: no more chat
 Astrobytes: AliyTheEngineer: complain here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/10">https://forum.codingame.com/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/10</a>
 AliyTheEngineer: i didnt complain tho
 Astrobytes: "aww man" sounds like disapproval to me&#160;;)
 jacek: nyoro~n
 struct: "The removal of chat should happen next week."
 struct: oh well
 struct: I don't think people will just move to discord
 struct: I think they might have the wrong idea
 jacek: people think this is discord
 eulerscheZahl: it is not?
 struct: This chat probably has more messages in 1 month than discord has in 1 year
 j4at: Codingame will never feel the same without chat, worst decision ever
 j4at: What about pm and coc chat&#160;?
 struct: all removed
 j4at: BRUH!
 j4at: Why are they removing it tho&#160;?
 therealbeef: 1. costly to maintain, 2. the spam, 3. discord as alternative
 Aldoggen: I haven't seen spam in like a week
 therealbeef: (just copying CG's message from the forum, not my opinion)
 Aldoggen: all right
 Revisto: HELLLLO
 struct: Thats because there hasnt been spam in like 1 month
 j4at: Chat with spam is better than no chat. Discord is not the same. I don't think that chat is costly to maintain!!
 j4at: compared to the games atleast
 struct: I probably averaged 1 ban per week last month
 AryanTripathi: sup
 DevMarcao: this chat here will be removed?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/9">https://forum.codingame.com/t/discussions-spaces-update-the-question-of-the-chat/196276/9</a>
 struct: You can always leave your opinion on it
 Ayza: discord is no different to be honest
 Ayza: only difference is you can delete messages
 Ayza: which can probably be easily made here
 DevMarcao: yeah but clash chat rooms are nice, i don't think they can be the same on discord
 j4at: I don't want to use discord it's partially owned by the ccp&#160;:)
 Ayza: yeah, I definitely don't want the chat to be deleted
 Ayza: faster and easier to communicate while doing a puzzle
 Ayza: instant response
 Astrobytes: make sure you express your opinion in the forum thread&#160;:)
 j4at: I can make a new chat for CG for free, and even put some backdoors.
 j4at: jk about the last part
 Westicles: hey, where's our clash type detector script?
 j4at: I lied Westicles
 Ayza: open source chat on top
 Westicles: j'accuse!
 Westicles: holding steady at 6 1-stars
 j4at: Yeah, didn't find a way to to detect the type of the clash. I thought I did but I was wrong I just got lucky :p
 struct: 44 more
 struct: you are not wrong
 struct: there is a way
 j4at: how struct&#160;?
 struct: playClash request gives it
 j4at: no it doesn't
 struct: it does
 struct: I just checked
 Westicles: :popcorn:
 j4at: it always return shortest
 struct: oh then im wrong
 eulerscheZahl: the word "shortest" is actually longer than "fastest"
 Astrobytes: Valuable knowledge.
 j4at: probably not even related to the mode of the game, but length  of the game probably. Maybe they were going to add long clashes
 eulerscheZahl: and i just told everyone, i really can't keep anything to myself&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: in the past there were 2 clash durations i think (was before my time)
 eulerscheZahl: 5min and 15min or so
 eulerscheZahl: CG veterans like JBM can tell you
 Westicles: they sunsetted the 5min
 eulerscheZahl: they kept the easy ones as clash and moved the rest to community puzzles
 Aldoggen: tbh I like 15 minutes more. I almost never need it, but when I do, it's a godsend
 eulerscheZahl: for shortest you need 15min or you are playing it wrong
 Westicles: I was surprised, I had a sort of tough clash approved yesterday
 StevenV: when will green-circle show up as a multi?
 Westicles: yesterday
 struct: its already a multi
 Astrobytes: -ish
 StevenV: oh
 Aldoggen: what version are they on currently?
 Aldoggen: I've seen low 50s
 Westicles: free xp as the fr say
 StevenV: thanks guys, I think that it would be on the top as always
 eulerscheZahl: CG even mentioned it in an email an hour ago
 StevenV: ah, I don't often check email
 eulerscheZahl: i have thunderbird running all the time
 StevenV: I've never used thunderbird
 j4at: I'm thinking of creating 3rd party clashes, with custom puzzles and modes.
 StevenV: don't even know what it is actually
 eulerscheZahl: you can select the mode (and language?) in private clashes
 j4at: I mean extra modes
 j4at: custom modes
 eulerscheZahl: like prettiest code?
 Astrobytes: longest
 j4at: no!
 eulerscheZahl: closest to emoji in code layout
 Astrobytes: Poetry?
 j4at: I will add brainfuck to list of languages&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: 1 hour time limit

 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Westicles: :rofl:
 Westicles: what?
 Astrobytes: forum thread response
 eulerscheZahl: the troll puzzle?
 Astrobytes: "I worry MAU metrics will be impacted as account banning and re-ups should drop drastically."
 eulerscheZahl: oh, a new one
 Westicles: well, that one guy must have made 10k accounts
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: Classic response :D
 Kellthazar: so, will this chat be terminated?
 DevMarcao: yes

 StevenV: :D
 Astrobytes: Since they asked for opinions
 StevenV: I really like this chat actually
 StevenV: so green-circle doesn't have the red league&#160;:(
 Kellthazar: sad that the chat will end, but I understand the reasons for it. Maintain a bloated functionality is a nightmare in most cases.
 StevenV: we can just keep the chat and won't maintain it :D
 StevenV: well there are me and boss2 only :D
 BrunoFelthes: no more leagues than wood for green circle?
 JosiahWI: The featured event says to get help and help your peers directly in the chat? Does that refer to this chat or another one?
 Aldoggen: lmao
 Aldoggen: Thibault be like: ok lemme just get one of the other unupdated pieces of **** I've been carrying in my pocket for all these years

 eulerscheZahl: Do you know Automaton2000? You don't? Okay, so, let's join the chat. Look at the right of the website and join the general channel. If you are level 3, just say "Hi Automaton2000" and the bot Automaton2000 will answer you.
 Automaton2000: also i need to get it
 Automaton2000: that's the way to go
 creeper82: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i am new to coding
 struct: Bye Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: when i have the same issues
 creeper82: lol Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i will try to learn it
 StevenV: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but no need to worry about it
 creeper82: well ok? lol
 HenroLST: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: that one is a bit weird
 HenroLST:&#160;:(
 creeper82: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what is your best friend
 creeper82: uhh. you?
 creeper82: nah just kidding you're a stupid bot
 HenroLST: ay
 HenroLST: dont be rude to my boy Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but there is no way to get an idea of what i do&#160;;-)
 j4at: Automaton2000 is tricking you humans and soon will takeover. As he said we have no idea what its doing.
 Automaton2000: you can just take the first move
 HenroLST: dang he even wants you to take the first move
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 how are you doing?
 Automaton2000: oh so i cant do anything
 Aldoggen: clearly not so well
 Daporan: I'm impartial, but if you really want the chat to stay then a last resort could be to tweet the forum thread to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/coderpad">https://twitter.com/coderpad</a>
 j4at: poor Automaton2000! we need to build a body for it
 Automaton2000: if i ever get to the top
 HenroLST: Automator2000, reply if I'm your favorite here
 HenroLST: NOOO I MISSPELLED
 Aldoggen: XD rip
 struct: Enough of Automaton spam
 HenroLST:&#160;:(
 Aldoggen: tip: you can tab-complete names
 struct: Time to ask jp to tweet since I dont have 1
 5DN1L: Does CG earn any revenue from this part of the website? Or just from CodinGame for Work?
 Aldoggen: I tried to find something about that in the about of this website
 HenroLST: I guess its fianlly time to make a twitter account
 Aldoggen: nothing afaik
 5DN1L: financial incentives would convince CG more than other factors, I guess
 Aldoggen: I believe there's a hidden financial incentive for keeping the chat
 Aldoggen: community
 HenroLST: true
 HenroLST: chats are supreme
 5DN1L: you can't just tell that to the CEO :shrug: you need numbers and evidence
 Aldoggen: so even if the current one gets removed (cause I can understand no one wants to work on this thing, it was made by an intern long ago), I hope they add a new one
 j4at: Make CG pay to win
 HenroLST: wait really? thats cool
 j4at: Easy money
 HenroLST: clash of code but you can buy powerups
 Aldoggen: yup, that's part of the problem. I don't now anything about finance lol
 HenroLST: minus 1 min = $5
 struct: pay 1$ per month to access chat
 struct: done
 HenroLST: ... or that
 HenroLST: but powerups
 Kellthazar: Hi Automoton2000
 j4at: pay 5$ per month to get emotes
 Kellthazar: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: he is a real problem
 Aldoggen: XD
 HenroLST: pay for access to automoton and upgrade him
 FrancoRoura: How can a chat become so expensive for a company like CG to think it's worth it to invest time in taking it down lol
 FrancoRoura: You literally need like 500MB ram on a Redis and wss 
 struct: I dont think its expensive to run it, but to maintain or add features 
 struct: but im not sure
 FrancoRoura: Tbh if it's not generating any benefit I'd just leave it as is and "abandon" it
 5DN1L: abandon = don't complain when pastebin breaks or chat disconnects :shrug:
 j4at: The chat makes money for the chat. Because it makes people participate in the sponsored events. right&#160;?
 j4at: for CG* :3
 HenroLST: or just watch ads start appearing in chat, or like watch an add for 30 min of chat
 Lassassin: how to increase fontsize of editor and console inside of codingame?
 StevenV: I like the active of you guys here on chat
 HenroLST:&#160;:)
 StevenV: so if you guys active on discord, np for me :D
 Aldoggen: Lassassin there's a settings button on the left
 Aldoggen: then press edit configuration
 Lassassin: thanks
 Aldoggen: np
 Lassassin: what about the one in console output?
 Lassassin: bottom left
 Aldoggen: I don't see settings there. for me they're in the vertical bar on the left
 Aldoggen: maybe we're just talking about the same thing
 HenroLST: uh im not sure if you can change the console output
 Aldoggen: oh, console?
 Aldoggen: hmm
 Aldoggen: nope
 HenroLST: whoaaa i can give brackets color
 Aldoggen: hey CG, what about fixing font resizability on your website instead of deleting chat?
 StevenV: The best solutions are revealed&gt;&gt;
 StevenV: so they will publish the solution for the optimation game?
 j4at: no
 StevenV: so what actually they do?
 StevenV: "The best solutions are revealed" this is on the feature optimization puzzle, what does this mean?
 5DN1L: unfixed text
 StevenV:&#160;???
 5DN1L: that description should have been removed
 5DN1L: but actually remains there
 StevenV: ah, thank; you
 5DN1L: np
 StevenV: most of tops of multi are C++, does it mean C++ is faster than Rust on CG?
 jacek: or no one knows rust
 StevenV: :D
 StevenV: I am gonna use Rust or C++ to solve multi on CG
 struct: c++ is slow on cg
 StevenV: I know C++ but not effictient enough to write a good bot and simultion
 Astrobytes: because it's not in release mode, there are tricks to make it run faster
 StevenV: maybe I should learn Rust
 jacek: learn iron and oxygen first
 Astrobytes: *learn chemistry first
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygene_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygene_(programming_language)</a>
 StevenV: I'll keep in mind that when starting to learn Rust
 Wishbone: Or if you want to learn something more entertaining but less useful, try learning brainfuck&#160;;-)
 StevenV:&#160;:(
 StevenV: I would stay away from that
 Wishbone: Hehe, esoteric programming languages can be quite fun to mess around with.
 eulerscheZahl: i recommend CG Funge
 Astrobytes: Was about to recommend that, plus Code of the Rings or whatever it's called now, and there are a few BF/funge puzzles too iirc
 StevenV: apart from fun, what is the point to learn those languages&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: brainfork
 Astrobytes: brain exercise&#160;;)
 GoodGoodNotBad: Little noob question :sweat_smile:. Is there a reason why I can't call functions declared outside of main in main? Are they not both in a class by default? (c++).
 eulerscheZahl: missing forward declaration?
 eulerscheZahl: do you define the function after main()?
 GoodGoodNotBad: oh god I did
 GoodGoodNotBad: thanks 
 jacek: oO
 jacek: Automaton2000 where do you go
 Automaton2000: you probably have to rewrite my code to make a bot for it
 Lassassin: goddamn there is no spoon more like there is no hope ._.
 jacek: hm?
 Lassassin: there is no spoon my brain tells me to write loops its mixing everything up 
 Lassassin: so many loops
 JBM: c++ has nested functions now?
 jacek: lambda?
 2wenty2wo: yeah lambda func
 JBM: good catch
 JBM: anyhoo, they're most certainly not in a class by default
 BrunoFelthes: why there is only 100 players at green circle?
 Astrobytes: Manual resubmission, no proper leagues, no mirror matches...
 BrunoFelthes: man, what is happening with CG?
 Astrobytes: devs were at a conference apparently, we'll find out next week if they add leagues or not I guess
 aCat: soo even no chat to complain about it&#160;:(
 BrunoFelthes: are they bank bankrupting?
 aCat: *soon
 Astrobytes: Since this was half-corporate and half-community, there are corporate contractual issues 
 Astrobytes: aCat: please post in the forum thread, even if it's purely for posterity

 struct: Yeah, leave a comment about it, even if its repetitive
 struct: Its not like it can hurt
 Astrobytes: there are also only 2 cats in there, we need more :P
 Astrobytes: BrunoFelthes: you know they were taken over by an American company right?
 JBM: oh, taken over?
 JBM: I only read the PR about a merger, this is interesting
 Astrobytes: By CoderPad yes
 Astrobytes: 'merger' lol
 JBM: keep talking
 jacek: its all about :money_with_wings:
 Astrobytes: what a time to ask! struct help me out here, I'm ducking in and out of chat here
 JBM: seriously, tell me more!
 struct: help with what?
 jacek: Astrobytes soon youll wont have that problem
 JBM: I just saw the bland ‚Äúwe're moving in the same direction, let's do it together‚Äù kind of shit
 Astrobytes: The coderpad takeover struct
 struct: ah yes
 struct: they bought CF
 struct: CG*
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://coderpad.io/about-us/coderpad-acquires-codingame/">https://coderpad.io/about-us/coderpad-acquires-codingame/</a>
 JBM: source?
 JBM: ah nice
 mlomb: what
 struct: this is old news
 mlomb: didnt know
 jacek: :ie:
 jacek: hum
 Astrobytes: struct JBM has been away for a lil bit
 struct: I see
 JBM: Cookies on CoderPad: Accept or‚Ä¶ no other option
 struct: Bruno goes straight to the point lol
 JBM: well I did read the CG-emitted mailing, but the change of tone here is a welcome addition to my attempt at an objective opinion
 JBM: &gt; its acquisition of CodinGame, a first-class candidate assessment platform and global developer skill building community.
 struct: They probably bought it for CG for work
 Astrobytes: we were all intrigued but cautiously optimistic until we found the coderpad post iirc
 jacek: acquisition by bigger corpo is mostly bad
 JBM: that is not at all what I considered CG to be when I joined
 JBM: didn't know it was bigger
 eulerscheZahl: that's the last page coderpad acquired: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.adaptilab.com/">https://www.adaptilab.com/</a>
 JBM: the CG mails did make it sound like ‚Äújoint forces‚Äù, assumed mostly same-sized
 struct: brb
 Astrobytes: there is apparently only one dev working on our part of CG at any one time
 Astrobytes: This was either on the forum or discord
 eulerscheZahl: i saw some open positions (cg hiring) - task description sounding like combining systems of cg + coderpad
 JBM: well thanks a lot struct, that was mighty eye-opening
 Astrobytes: they recently got rid of the 'get a job' part here too, useless outside of FR iirc
 Astrobytes: "think global!"
 Eandy11: have you guys done the N agents one
 Eandy11: given N agents, find the traitor
 Eandy11: that one
 JBM: if I knew which one was the traitor I wouldn't make a CG problem out of it

 eulerscheZahl: you can also see that in the job titles of their recent hires
 Astrobytes: lol JBM
 JBM: the only one I noticed was the ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù
 eulerscheZahl: growth marketer, growth assistant
 Astrobytes: tbf they had tech evangelists before (I am still unsure of what the and uncomfortable with any meaning of that is)
 eulerscheZahl: what even is a growth copywriter?
 jacek: he comes up with new names for puzzles and games
 Astrobytes: writing copy for growth. Bullshit marketing-focused blog posts? 
 eulerscheZahl: for the protocol: i'm not bashing on random people i don't even know. just pointing out that there is a surprising high amount of non-developers
 Astrobytes: Welcome to corporation-land.
 JBM: copywriter sounds way nicer than homophone copyrighter
 eulerscheZahl: there is also growth hacker and head of growth
 Astrobytes: Dilute any meaning from your target, grow it based on invented marketing hype, sell.
 JBM: with all this growth-drivenness they still take decisions aimed at harming the actual community
 Astrobytes: Wrong kind of growth.
 eulerscheZahl: i think they changed some titles in general. "head of people &amp; culture". i think she was HR before
 Astrobytes: This whole side is essentially dead to them
 Astrobytes: (the corporate masters I mean, not CG staff)
 JBM: s/HR/PC/ is a worldwide trend, nothing really specific to see here
 eulerscheZahl: compared with wayback machine, definitely some job titles renamed

 PatrickMcGinnisII: One of my GF's besties was a headhunter until CoV hit, then she moved to HR within a large company.  I sat in on one of her interviews with an 'engineer' ... intelligent young man, yes ... coder, no.  Headhunting is big $$, companies need solutions ... and frankly the US doesn't have the hardcore programmers.  Alot of reasons for this (in general).
 JBM: there's really no more sanitation-related meaning to surface in {fr} as there is in {en}
 eulerscheZahl: oh, mathis hammel gets a mustache on mouse-over on my last link :D
 Astrobytes: It's descriptive yet exceptionally vague, interesting :D
 JBM: that's the evangelist, isn't it?
 Eandy11: how do you find the 2 numbers of something when you have the sum and product of those 2 numbers
 JBM: I'm sure I've read his name before, I've (still) got to dig
 Eandy11: im using Javascript
 wagabond12: hey, how can i join clash of code with my friends, to a global lobby&#160;? 
 Eandy11: no clue what to do
 Astrobytes: try writing out on paper, or whiteboard to save trees
 HenroLST: you could use algebra
 eulerscheZahl: he's active on some competitive platforms like codeforces
 HenroLST: x+y=sum; xy = mul
 JBM: not sure whiteboard actually saves trees compared to paper
 HenroLST: then you just manipulate those equations to get what you want
 JBM: active, but noteworthy?

 Astrobytes: Depends what you use as a pen and whiteboard JBM, though true
 Astrobytes: Lets all get active on other platforms then CoderPad might hire us for CG....
 Astrobytes: ...
 JBM: that better than CG hiring you directly?
 eulerscheZahl: let me invite you to topcoder if you like optimization tasks
 Astrobytes: Not sure :thinking:
 JBM: pretty sure I;ve already got a dormant acct there
 Astrobytes: yeah I think you might enjoy some of the TC marathons JBM

 HenroLST: panic why is there a line of 2 minature dots going through the middle of my chat
 Automaton2000: is it possible to reach legend

 jacek: oh my
 PatrickMcGinnisII: help us Automaton2000
 HenroLST: wait what the its scrolling with the chat
 Automaton2000: to get the best move
 struct: Maybe I should pin the post :D
 eulerscheZahl: abuse your mod powers, i'm all for it
 eulerscheZahl: i abused mine to get the hypnotoad title on the forum
 Astrobytes: And I have my 5%

 HenroLST: ... uh oh
 Jay10890: anyone got the answer to mars lander episode 2
 Astrobytes: 12
 Jay10890: got answer to mars lander ep 2?
 Jay10890: struct do u got it?
 struct: oh I never done mars landers 2
 eulerscheZahl: he pinned a forum post
 Astrobytes: 42
 Jay10890: eular u got the code?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jay , like search github er somethin.  42 is the best answer
 Jay10890: wym 42
 eulerscheZahl: i got one code. there are almost infinitely many solutions
 HenroLST: 42: the answer to life the universe and everything
 Jay10890: ok
 eulerscheZahl: the only thing that prevents the infinite amount if the 100k code size limit
 Jay10890: euler how long as it been
 eulerscheZahl: i don't understand
 Jay10890: since we last met
 struct: wait the other post that was pined is gone
 struct: o.o
 Jay10890: been months tbh
 eulerscheZahl: if you are the one i think, not long enough
 eulerscheZahl: pinned posts only show as pinned for you until you open them, struct
 eulerscheZahl: try again in incognito, then it should be back to normal
 struct: ah
 struct: thanks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm gonna be in D.C. in 10 days, any advice?
 eulerscheZahl: or you broke it :imp:
 struct: well it was worth
 struct: this topic is more important
 BugKiller_328: @Astrobytes, @struct
 struct: yes?
 Astrobytes: hi BugKiller_328
 BugKiller_328: I don't know who suggested me about iterative deepening.I've applied it to connect 4 and my ranking was upgraded from 79th -&gt; 54th
 BugKiller_328: in wood 1 league. thanks.
 Astrobytes: possibly either or both of us
 struct: nice
 Astrobytes: and nice, well done&#160;:)
 BugKiller_328: no 53th as final result
 eulerscheZahl: might have been me. i was thinking about it but not sure if i spelled it out
 BugKiller_328: with Java lang
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: now implement bitboards&#160;:)
 jacek: and do you use ordering while iterative deepening?
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: Well, from DC you can tell us if it's better than AC
 eulerscheZahl: jacek wrote it, credits to him
 BugKiller_328: maybe need to migrate java to c++?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2022-06-29">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2022-06-29</a>
 struct: you can try BugKiller_328
 Astrobytes: lol, nice one euler
 BugKiller_328: Ah, @jacek  Thanks
 BugKiller_328: I think @jacek @Astrobytes, @struct you all! thanks again
 struct: np
 Astrobytes: you are very welcome
 eulerscheZahl: use the chat to your advantage
 BugKiller_328: @jacek "and do you use ordering while iterative deepening?" what is this?
 eulerscheZahl: you have good and bad moves from minimax
 Astrobytes: move ordering
 Astrobytes: try the best one first
 eulerscheZahl: as you have pruning, the order matters. apply the best first to prune more
 Jay10890: i found this\
 Jay10890: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5ca7c25-3f43-4516-9564-dd0435c9ed43">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5ca7c25-3f43-4516-9564-dd0435c9ed43</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no you didn't find it
 BugKiller_328: how to ordering for my available moves.
 Astrobytes: It's an advantage of iterative deepening in that you know the best move from the previous depth searched
 Jay10890: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/vadim-job-hg/Codingame/blob/master/MEDIUM/MARS%20LANDER/python/mars-lander-episode-2.py">https://github.com/vadim-job-hg/Codingame/blob/master/MEDIUM/MARS%20LANDER/python/mars-lander-episode-2.py</a>
 Jay10890: this it?
 eulerscheZahl: there is not this one correct solution. code your own
 Astrobytes: ^
 Jay10890: tried
 eulerscheZahl: try harder
 Astrobytes: hence why your silly question got sill answers
 Astrobytes: *silly
 jacek: Jay10890 have you ran it
 eulerscheZahl: or try another puzzle and come back later
 Jay10890: yes
 jacek: BugKiller_328 i.e. in chess you would try capturing moves first. in othello the corner moves
 Astrobytes: Or learn something about the problem you are trying to solve, in order to better understand it
 Astrobytes: @Jay10890
 jacek: but with iterative deepening + transposition table, you can try the best moves from previous iteration
 jacek: as they are likely to produce faster cutoff

 Astrobytes: things like this are why I love this chat
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted to download all chat logs and extract URLs but somehow never did
 jacek: my youtube links? :smirk:
 Astrobytes: well, the logs will remain I guess as long as dbdr doesn't remove them
 jacek: hopefully after chat is removed theyll see significant drop in :moneybag: and bring it back
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely, i see myself more as a cost factor for CG
 HenroLST: STRIKE
 Astrobytes: I doubt that. They'll see a drop in use of the free side
 Astrobytes: what euler said
 BugKiller_328: @jacek do you have youtube channel? what's it?
 Astrobytes: Personally, I think open-sourcing a lot of this side of CG would be a huge benefit
 jacek: here we go <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>

 eulerscheZahl: damn, too slow
 Astrobytes: Yeah don't click that one BugKiller_328
 BugKiller_328: Is MCTS much harder than alpha beta?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap it's raining
 eulerscheZahl: it's different
 eulerscheZahl: but yes, takes a few more lines to code
 Astrobytes: But if you understand alphabeta/minimax well it is easy enough to understand
 eulerscheZahl: and it's hard to understand as a human what's going on. easy to code a bug and not even realize that it's wrong
 Astrobytes: as euler says though, it's a little more work to implement
 BugKiller_328: hmm, MCTS, GA, NN
 BugKiller_328: what should I go first?
 BugKiller_328: make an order for me
 Astrobytes: get really good at alphabeta first
 BugKiller_328: alpha beta already done
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 11k pos / second... move ordering ... nah doesn't work great for CG
 struct: 11k pos in php?
 Astrobytes: move ordering, pv, null window, negascout etc? BugKiller_328
 jacek: killer moves
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 11k nope, more like 2k
 jacek: and well GA is rather broad, it doesnt have to have anything with tree search
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think i did something similar for the bike race puzzle
 BugKiller_328: I really like to know how to check isWin in connect 4
 Astrobytes: history, fail high or low? TTs and all the fun that comes with them, the list goes on
 Astrobytes: *fail hard or soft
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/Fbf9HIO">https://tech.io/snippet/Fbf9HIO</a>MCTS for connect4. not optimized for speed at all
 BugKiller_328: I have 4 for loops. 1 for horizontal, 1 for vertical, 1 for positive diagno, 1 for negative diagno
 Astrobytes: well that's where bitboards come in
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BugKiller_328 it's hard for CG version because of width and fitting it in 2 - 64 bit boards
 BugKiller_328: anyone tried bitboard in Java?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not different to bitboard in other languages
 Astrobytes: Plenty people do
 BugKiller_328: I'm asking this because as I remember, 
 eulerscheZahl: but be careful about shifting: java only has signed integers and thus &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;
 BugKiller_328: when I try bitboard in c++ in times ago
 Astrobytes: I think some of the bitwise operations are slightly different in java but the concept remains unchanged
 BugKiller_328: I used some c++ specific api functions
 Astrobytes: intrinsics?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think u have to make sure you don't get stuck in a 2's complement arrangement
 eulerscheZahl: popcount
 Nerchio: yeah you lack some nice functions to use bitset in java, and you're probably not going to be much higher than wala's places in those games (he's top30 in connect 4 with java)
 Nerchio: even if you somehow optimized everything you can
 BugKiller_328: __builtin_ctzl, __builtin_ia32_pdep_si, __builtin_popcountl
 struct: top 20 should be possible 
 BugKiller_328: these kind of func
 struct: out of those this is the only one I use for c4
 struct: const U64 pdep = _pdep_u64((1ULL &lt;&lt; rand(__builtin_popcountll(safe_moves))), safe_moves);
 struct: to select a random set bit in safe_moves
 BugKiller_328: @struct, do you have that kind of code for java?
 struct: no
 Astrobytes: Print it out, spill coffee on it [solved] :P
 Astrobytes: afaik, C/C++/Rust are probably the ones you wanna use for bitboard-intensive stuff
 eulerscheZahl: C# got better in that regards
 BugKiller_328: c++ vs c#&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: C++ still faster
 BugKiller_328: c++ much faster than c#?
 Astrobytes: I was about to add that I think C# might be better than Java too
 BugKiller_328: or slightly?
 eulerscheZahl: but C' has release more on CG at least
 Astrobytes: *C#, mode
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: # and ' are the same key with shift on my keyboard
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.bitoperations.popcount?view=net-6.0">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.bitoperations.popcount?view=net-6.0</a>
 Astrobytes: # and ~ here
 eulerscheZahl: relatively new but i think you can use it on CG already
 eulerscheZahl: and syntax-wise C# and Java are similar enough that you can switch easily
 BugKiller_328: I know c, c++ too
 jacek: remember they have uppercase methods names :unamused:
 BugKiller_328: c, c++, c# a little, java (in depth more)
 struct: if you want to learn bitboards choose c++
 eulerscheZahl: and IInterfaces - the last bit of hungarian notation
 Astrobytes: I would use the language you are most comfortable with then, that has the best features that you need
 BugKiller_328: c++ not c?
 Joey_G: It's PascalCase not Uppercase
 struct: c++ its easier
 BugKiller_328: but speed is similar?
 struct: I think so
 eulerscheZahl: UPPERCASE
 Joey_G: right
 struct: Speed its almost irrelevant on c4
 BugKiller_328: again what about c++ vs c#
 eulerscheZahl: but C# uses PascalCase
 Astrobytes: Yes, speed is similar, be careful with using some standard containers though
 BugKiller_328: c++ is much faster or slighly faster than c#?
 eulerscheZahl: camelCase for private stuff
 j4at: C# is a lot slower than C++
 struct: for bitboards I would say much faster
 Astrobytes: snake_case
 eulerscheZahl: that's so python
 Astrobytes: preferred in C++ too 
 struct: snake is how I code c++
 j4at: python_case
 Joey_G: IdIoTcAsE
 Astrobytes: j4at: speed-wise he was speaking of C vs C++
 eulerscheZahl: for java, c#, python i try to follow conventions. for c++ i never read a style guide&#160;:(
 Kellthazar: Are you folks talking about the event?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 j4at: C are C++ are equal speedwise
 Joey_G: rANdOmcaSE
 eulerscheZahl: as long as you stay away from polymorphism
 Astrobytes: And resizing std containers on the fly
 Joey_G: Did anyone simulate CodeVsZombies?
 Astrobytes: Most people with a decent score yes
 Joey_G: I'm having trouble with reversing the  targeting mechanics, I think there may be some issues?
 Joey_G: Is there anyone who could perfectly predict the movement?
 jzen: I think mine does, I'll check

 Joey_G: Got it
 struct: its a class
 struct: class Point {float x, y;float dist ...}
 BlaiseEbuth: Geronimo!
 Joey_G: "inline float distance (int _x, int _y)" gets called with "distance(dist2)" but dist is just an int. Am I missing something?
 <b>**BlaiseEbuth wait for the taco-hammer.</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: might be an int yeah
 waterproofsodium: somebody familiar with markov chains?
 waterproofsodium: (stuck at a problem 2+ days straight, trying to educate myself on the topic)
 BlaiseEbuth: Automaton2000 are you familiar with Markov Chains&#160;?
 Automaton2000: so when you do this
 Joey_G: "inline float distance (int _x, int _y)" gets called with "distance(dist2)" but dist2 is just an int. Am I missing something?

 Joey_G: So it's overloaded. ty
 jacek: markov chain? which puzzle
 waterproofsodium: jacek it's for google foobar. non public
 jzen: Probably 'Markov Text Generation'
 jzen: By wonton
 jacek: oh
 waterproofsodium: nope not text generation
 jzen: Oh
 jzen: nvm
 jzen: It's a good puzzle for learning then
 waterproofsodium: I'm on a timer and the topics diverge slightly :D
 GlitchedPug: can someone help me the the tempertures puzzle?
 jacek: eeyup

 BugKiller_328: I can see this code, but which header I need to include?
 waterproofsodium: and 5 in total
 BugKiller_328: only chrono?
 BugKiller_328: ah, I missed 
 BugKiller_328: thanks
 jacek: chrono
 jacek: and namespace
 jacek: oh
 BugKiller_328: in c++, min int inf and max int inf?
 j4at: jacek, CPython 3.12 will have a jit. The problem with pypy is that ML libraries doesn't support it&#160;:( 
 j4at: My hold the lnie record is 136.88 which is pretty slow
 jacek: thats problem for those who use ML libraries :v
 waterproofsodium: how can you compile python to jit? I bet only by torturing the JIT compiler
 Astrobytes: min = -INT_MAX, max = INT_MAX if that's what you are asking
 j4at: I use it for web hosting and video game servers.
 jacek: j4at noice, my NN gets 150+
 j4at: hehe non
 j4at: noob
 BugKiller_328: where's INT_MAX lives?

 BugKiller_328: rand number for 0 to n?
 cyberPanda: hez
 waterproofsodium: if hidden tests are good. they will make you fail when you didn't do your research :p
 jzen: rand()&#160;% n
 BugKiller_328: rand() will just from 0 ~ max int?

 jzen: Well, rand() gives you a random int from 0 to max, and when you take the modulo you will get a number in [0:n-1]
 jzen: So yeah
 Joey_G: Struct, your code is correctly working. Thank you.
 struct: np Joey_G
 jzen: n is non-inclusive however
 j4at: yeah struct I already saw it, pretty impressive
 Astrobytes: but you can make functions to change that if you need. Also, prefer even std random methods over rand()
 struct: yours is NN right?
 j4at: mine is NN
 struct: do you use policy for moves?
 j4at: yeah
 j4at: RL, ddpg variant

 Blokops: any javascript user here? can someone explain in 20 words or less how to methods?
 Astrobytes: how to methods: method
 Blokops: interesting 
 Astrobytes: it made equal sense with your question&#160;;)

 Blokops: how to make a method
 struct: BugKiller_328 check the snippet I wrote
 struct: you are missing
 Astrobytes: @BugKiller_328: check structs snippet
 struct: short A::data = 1;
 struct: or w/e value you want
 Astrobytes: OUTSIDE of the class and OUTSIDE of the main
 BugKiller_328: short A::data = 1; how we can do??
 Astrobytes: this is usually a header/definition issue but CG is different I guess

 Aldoggen: Blokops check out W3Schools. They're pretty good for explaining simple things
 Blokops: im here because W3Scjhools are shit
 Aldoggen: well all right lets move to private chat
 BugKiller_328: @struct I want to do it inside main function
 BugKiller_328: because I can only know value inside  main
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/CtHOfPZ.png">https://i.imgur.com/CtHOfPZ.png</a>
 struct: thats needed
 BugKiller_328: ah, but why is it needed outside main?
 BugKiller_328: why we need to initialize it once outside main?
 Aldoggen: the compiler needs to know what you're going to do
 Aldoggen: is the short answer
 BugKiller_328: Can I do that inside class?
 j4at: Blokops

 Astrobytes: No BugKiller_328
 Astrobytes: That is the point. That static variable must be initialized outside of the class
 jacek: blashemy
 BugKiller_328: hmm, I'm most comfortable in Java. and I only used c++ for algorithm solve. 
 BugKiller_328: so almost didn't use the class.
 BugKiller_328:&#160;:(
 BugKiller_328: maybe I don't know basics
 j4at: is domi using NN in search race&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: domiko
 jacek: really?
 struct: yes
 struct: and in py3
 struct: real python
 struct: his csb is also NN
 struct: and also py3
 jacek: oh my
 j4at: Don't worry soon enough I will pass him and pass recurse too
 j4at: I had 10.9k NN but accidentally overwrote it. Needs to train again&#160;:(
 struct: hardcoded?
 j4at: Well kinda. I do a little search over my NN and use the best solution
 j4at: struct I didn't use beam search like I told you I was going to do. I used pure reinforcement learning
 j4at: hard coding sucks
 Aldoggen: seems like it'd be a good vacuum cleaner
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Aldoggen: oof all right I'll shut up
 Blokops: the good thing of lerning a new language is that i can just copy my code golf and get free points
 ellen_lu: could someone help me on starting the "block the spreading fire?"
 struct: check cg video ellen_lu

 Blokops: the problem looks like Montecristo
 Blokops: monte carlo
 BlaiseEbuth: :3
 Blokops: sayyyy does javascript also have an encoder as python?
 Blokops: utf16(?) to utf8 sort of encoder
 Blokops: nvm found one
 BugKiller_328: hi
 Blokops: hi
 BugKiller_328: in connect 4, if depth is 0, I need to calculate heuristic
 BugKiller_328: what is the best way for it?
 Aldoggen: check if the game is over maybe?
 Aldoggen: idk
 BugKiller_328: no can't do that 
 BugKiller_328: need to estimate the score of current board (which is not finished yet
 Aldoggen: it might be finished if you search reaches depth 0
 BugKiller_328: depth 0 means it reached depth limitation 
 Aldoggen: I don't know a better heuristic sorry
 BugKiller_328: in minimax, if I search with depth 4, then in depth 4
 BugKiller_328: game can't be finished 
 BugKiller_328: which means, we need to try calc heuristic
 Aldoggen: my "heuristic" would just amount to almost random moves, except when it sees the game ends in 4 moves
 Aldoggen: so yeah I understand you don't want that&#160;:)
 BugKiller_328: ah, you're doing random move?
 Aldoggen: nope
 Aldoggen: if I use as heuristic to check for the end of the game, I get what I wrote above. so most of the time just random moves, because most of the time the game won't end, which means most moves are equally fine for the bot
 Aldoggen: maybe a better heuristic is to look at the amount of 3 stones on a line?
 Aldoggen: amount of 2 stones on a line would be important too.
 Aldoggen: but for both of those, you should only count them when they're not blocked
 Aldoggen: maybe that can serve as a nice heuristic
 BugKiller_328: I already to in that way. I'm in rank betwen 55 ~ 80 
 Aldoggen: then I probably can't help you&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: good luck!
 j4at: block the spreading fire best solution is to hard code it.
 j4at: there is only few validators
 struct: I dont do eval, I use mcts so cant help
 BugKiller_328: @struct, can you give me some code for connect 4?
 BugKiller_328: which is using bitboard
 BugKiller_328: droppiece, check win
 BugKiller_328: no idea clearly yet for bitboard use for connect 4.
 BugKiller_328: if you can't , it's fine&#160;:)
 HenroLST: anyone willing to take a quick look at my code and see where it might go wrong? its the puzzle scrabble and i pass all but three cases
 struct: Well it might be a little unfair for other players
 BugKiller_328: ok, then&#160;:)
 struct: I can show you how I apply a move and how I generate them
 struct: But wincheck and such are avx and its probably not fair for other for me to share
 BugKiller_328: yes. totally fine. I can understand. I can try myself for it.
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/wLLxRgbf">https://pastebin.com/wLLxRgbf</a>
 struct: thats about everything I will share
 struct: Whats outside applies a random move
 struct: to check for win you will need to use masks
 struct: 0x7E3F1F8FC7E3F1F8ULL, 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL, 0x7E3F1F8FC7E3F1F8ULL, 0xFC7E3F1F8FC7E3FULL
 BugKiller_328: ooo.. what a horrible numbers. haha
 struct: its too prevent overlap
 BugKiller_328: maybe need to take time for the experiences.
 struct: so when I do &gt;&gt; 1
 struct: I wont end up on bottom row
 struct: since I wanted to check the piece on the right
 struct: yes, I think there are better games to learn bitboards
 struct: connect 4 is probably not the easiest one
 BugKiller_328: need 2 board
 BugKiller_328: 1 is for me
 BugKiller_328: other is for opponent?
 struct: yes
 struct: thats what I do
 BugKiller_328: lowest place to be (0,0)?
 struct: for me 0, 0 is bottom right
 struct: But that's personal preference
 BugKiller_328: in board (0,0) is in most right side bit?
 struct: 0, 0 is bit index 0
 BugKiller_328: bit index 0 means most right side bit 
 BugKiller_328: am I right? :D
 struct: I think so
 struct: I would try something simpler first bugkiller
 struct: probably normal tic  tac toe to learn the bitobards
 struct: its what I did to learn it
 BugKiller_328: yeah, I did it fewmonths ago a little
 BugKiller_328: but I came back to learn more
 MAWAAW: Buy the rumor. Sell the news.
 Darleanow: Night everyone&#160;:)
 Darleanow: struct werent u mod&#160;?
 EzS-NoVa: hiiiiiiiii uwu
 HenroLST: hm

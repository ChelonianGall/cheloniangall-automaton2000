 NoiselessKnight_28b2: OKAY! Good news. I came back to it, and I solved the problem. I think that I can give some hints to whomever might be struggling. My discord is NightRaven#4025
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: what's your discord?
 Automaton2000: what are u doing it in c++ and c#
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: java
 UsernameAsterix: hey

 NoiselessKnight_28b2: thx
 jiniiii: hi
 HMu0510: hi
 TheMysteriousCube_4a5a: hi~
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: hi
 icecream17: hi
 NoiselessKnight_28b2: anyone know why all the validators for this weeks puzzle pass except for the last one? Anyone solve this?
 syoon: it's bug
 icecream17: weeks puzzle is hard. i'm still trying to figure out how not to use too much brute force
 icecream17: but with only 27 lines of code a heap already ran out of memory
 Dark2Master: hey..
 Andrew-Causelof: day
 Andrew-Causelof: hey
 jacek: winter wrap up winter wrap up, lets finish our holiday cheer
 jacek: winter wrap up winter wrap up, cause tomorrow spring is here!
 Uljahn: winter wrap up is 20 percent cooler with AVX :sunglasses:
 struct: I think ill pause on CSB a bit
 struct: Do you want arimaa?
 Uljahn: Omar Syed announced a $10,000 prize for the creation of such an Arimaa bot which could win a 10-game match against Sharp. This has not yet been done. :thinking:
 Uljahn: "we are offering a prize of at least $10,000 USD until 2020"&#160;:(
 struct: 2020 still counts right?
 struct: AutomatonNN give me an idea
 AutomatonNN: why do you see the result of the game?
 AmoSimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bfe92af6-9b94-459f-bae5-7a385d599f54">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bfe92af6-9b94-459f-bae5-7a385d599f54</a>
 AmoSimo: can anyone tell me what i did wrong&#160;?
 AmoSimo: challenge is "There is no spoon"
 AmoSimo: says: "invalid input. Expected 'x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3' but found '0 0 0 0'"
 eulerscheZahl: you are supposed to print 6 numbers in a line, not 4
 MostComplicatedUsername: Why can't I test my code?
 MostComplicatedUsername: It's showing me the results of the test, but not the replay
 eulerscheZahl: do you have a premium account?
 MostComplicatedUsername: That's a thing?
 eulerscheZahl: kidding, which game?
 MostComplicatedUsername: CSB
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is that python?  hell if i know... but your logic has holes in it where x and y == ""
 eulerscheZahl: test results for CSB? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: you mean win/loss?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes, it shows that
 eulerscheZahl: there should be a replay tooF12, go to console
 eulerscheZahl: any errors?
 RoboStac: replays often break, refreshing normally fixes it (I'm assuming you are getting err output, but the replay doesn't change?)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AmoSimo see the hole in the logic?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Doesn't even show
 MostComplicatedUsername: The output
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Just who won
 MostComplicatedUsername: k
 AntiSquid: MostComplicatedUsername are you AmoSimo&#160;? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what if j+1=width AmoSimo
 AntiSquid: just confused with chat
 MostComplicatedUsername: no
 MostComplicatedUsername: how do I post screenshot?
 AmoSimo: yeah yah
 eulerscheZahl: imgur.com
 AmoSimo: found it
 eulerscheZahl: or any other image hoster
 MostComplicatedUsername: ill just post on discord?
 eulerscheZahl: ok...
 AmoSimo: this may be a dumb question cuz i didn't use python for quite a while, let alone this site, but is there a syntax error in "if (j+2) =&gt; (width):"
 RoboStac: yes, its &gt;= 
 dbdr: &gt;=
 AmoSimo: oh ok thanks
 MostComplicatedUsername: o nvm
 MostComplicatedUsername: found problem
 dbdr: you don't need the brackets
 jrke: please share code at end
 Cesarus82: CORONA VIRUS
 icecream17: Is it possible to not use brute force in the weekly puzzle?
 Muffle9: hey
 Muffle9: :eggplant::peach::taco:
 Uljahn: icecream17: what do you mean?
 Uljahn: i searched all combinations with some optimizations in python with 100-200 ms per testcase
 icecream17: oh ok
 icecream17: does pemdas apply?
 icecream17: e.g.: Is 2 + 3 * 4 + 5 * 7
 icecream17: [49] or [150]?
 icecream17: Nevermind, it does....
 jthemphill: @icecream17: you just choose two numbers and an operation, there's no need to consider order of operations
 icecream17: time to rewrite my whole code....
 struct: happens to me too
 JBM: still beats testing
 FabioSmeriglio: Sorry guys, if a second validation test (one of those AFTER the submit) keeps failing, is there a way to test that case specifically when it is not in the Test Cases inside the IDE?
 darkhorse64: No. Validators are hidden
 struct: which puzzle is it btw?
 FabioSmeriglio: Alright, thanks, then i don't know how to solve the horses one
 struct: can you put your code here&#160;?
 FabioSmeriglio: the 6th validation keeps failing: called "Horses in disorder" but i expect it to be the same as "Horses in any order" inside the test cases...and that one works
 struct: FabioSmeriglio put your code here
 struct: Ill check

 darkhorse64: why check if diff == 1&#160;?
 struct: if I remove $diff == 1
 struct: itr works

 struct: Now I got php achievement
 FabioSmeriglio: freak...i didn't read properly...the minimum difference could also be zero
 struct: how to remove?
 FabioSmeriglio: i thought the min value was 1
 struct: fixed right?
 FabioSmeriglio: yep, stupid error XD Thanks
 HMu0510: jin
 dsetzer: ouch the weekly puzzle is so stupid...
 dsetzer: there's also an error in test case 04, this can be done in 3 operations but it says it's expecting 5
 MostComplicatedUsername: uh oh are submits broken again?
 MostComplicatedUsername: nvm

 ipsissimus: 4 people 
 ipsissimus: 1 sage
 Wontonimo: 1 tomato
 ipsissimus: i had a job interview today
 ipsissimus: hopefully i did good
 ipsissimus: really need that income
 Wontonimo: yeah&#160;!
 Wontonimo: i hope so too
 Thorcode: Good luck ipsissimus
 ipsissimus: was for a company that wants to do facial recognition as 2FA
 Broso56: hopefully it goes well!
 Thorcode: ipsissimus try your best
 ipsissimus: im not raising my hopes
 ipsissimus: that way i cant get rekt
 <b>**Thorcode hope ipsissimus pass</b></p><p><img src="/a/70831423647635" /> ipsissimus: wasnt a coding interview. i just talked alot about project management
 ipsissimus: threw alot of mythical man month jargon out there
 ipsissimus: :O
 Thorcode: idk but I still wish you pas
 Wontonimo: hey ipsissimus, I hope *random platitude* for for you.  And don't forget *irrelevant tangent idea* always helps
 ipsissimus: indeed 
 Wontonimo: did you joke with the interviewer and actually make them smile?
 Wontonimo: i don't mean knock-knock jokes
 ipsissimus: i tried. im pretty charismatic under pressure
 ipsissimus: but who knows what theyre thinking
 Wontonimo: awesome
 ipsissimus: i really want it, i have a meeting with a FB recruiter and a Florida Power &amp; light manager on monday
 ipsissimus: and im dreading those
 Wontonimo: well, i'm tired
 Wontonimo: I'm gonna go do that think where you lie prone and lose consciousness
 Wontonimo: later :wave:
 ipsissimus: die?
 ipsissimus: dont do it
 KayKay1202: Do we wanna join a Google meet everyone
 ipsissimus: theres so much code to write
 KayKay1202:&#160;? Or nah
 ipsissimus: nah
 KayKay1202: Fair enough hah
 ipsissimus: I shleep
 ipsissimus: :v:
 KayKay1202: Hey
 KayKay1202: Anybody here
 KayKay1202: :sob:

 KayKay1202: HELLO?
 KayKay1202: ANYONE??????
 jacek: happy Caturday
 KayKay1202: you too.
 KayKay1202: hey guys
 ziggityzaggity: yo
 Broso56: hey
 KayKay1202: hello
 ProCoder03: hello 
 JHBonarius: Wait, why is "Coders strike back" now called "mad code racing"?
 JHBonarius: sorry "mad pod racing"
 TheBlueBias: Copyright issues fear...
 JHBonarius: the joke used to be that all competitions had something like "code" in it
 eulerscheZahl: and a reference to a movie
 JHBonarius: The link is still /ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back and it states the title in the opening screen
 TheBlueBias: Enough fear to do something, ,oy enough to do it correctly.
 TheBlueBias: *not
 JHBonarius: Tron has also been renamed...
 JHBonarius: Disney :rage:
 TheBlueBias: And others...
 TheBlueBias: Well, Disney said nothing, CG done it by anticipation
 JHBonarius: hmm, indeed pirates of the Caribbean is also Disney, but that hasn't been renamed
 jacek: lets call them :imp:
 JHBonarius: Seems they only use email
 JHBonarius: hmm, vs code is weird
 JHBonarius: I open a folder. Add a subdirectory. Want to add a second subdirectory, but it adds it below the existion subdirectory, instead on in the top directory
 TheBlueBias: Yeah. You have to click the parent directory first.
 JHBonarius: I did
 TheBlueBias: Hm... I generally use a right click on the directory instead of the generic button.
 JHBonarius: If I click it, it collapses the whole directory tree and the "add directory" icons dissapear
 JHBonarius: Yeah, so that doesn't work for the top level directory/root
 eulerscheZahl: JHBonarius i can assure you the list of games that need renaming or other changes is longer. it's just the first few that have been renamed already
 JHBonarius: Ah, found it. You have to right click somehwere in the tree pane, not on some existing directory or file
 JHBonarius: very intuitive... not
 JHBonarius: eulerscheZahl sad times
 eulerscheZahl: yes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that and the missing contest
 eulerscheZahl: no community  contest either. I even gave them a finished game and they refused<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tryangle-catch">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tryangle-catch</a>
 TheBlueBias: Ah, for the top directory, yes... Need time to integrate this behaviour...
 JHBonarius: i think it's because they are jealous of your skills
 eulerscheZahl: they figured out that only 1.64% of their users come to compete in a completely transparent poll
 JHBonarius: I'm using VS 40+h a week, which is weirdly different
 eulerscheZahl: what is that add directly that you are talking about now?
 JHBonarius: vscode intuitive interface
 eulerscheZahl: ah. i use VS Code at home
 eulerscheZahl: VS at work
 eulerscheZahl: no VS for linux
 JHBonarius: it worked. I'm backing up all of my bots now. I had some files on my drive but found the online bots differ. Don't know what happened there
 JHBonarius: how are you doing by the way
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine. just trying a few other contests outside of CG
 eulerscheZahl: and remote working for a long time, only 4 days in office in 2021 so far
 TheBlueBias: linux -&gt; virtualbox -&gt; windows vm -&gt; vs. EZPZ
 JHBonarius: oh wow. I that typical for where you live?
 eulerscheZahl: lots of colleagues go to the office. but i'm pretty much the only programmer in a team of CAD designers
 eulerscheZahl: so my presence isn't really needed. and still not too many people wanted inside the office
 JHBonarius: YEah, if it works out it's good.I work better at my office. less distractions.
 eulerscheZahl: similar here. my company only demands 45% of your days spent in office (business trips count as office)
 eulerscheZahl: they even offered 100% i've been told, but employee representatives didn't agree on this one (fairness to others who can't work remotely)
 JHBonarius: 100% what? in office or from home?
 eulerscheZahl: 100% remote
 eulerscheZahl: optional, employees can still go to the office
 eulerscheZahl: just as an offer
 JHBonarius: ah. yeah. I think that's seriously considered now. Altough I don't like that some companies are reducing pay for people that work from home
 eulerscheZahl: they do?
 JHBonarius: yeah google did that
 JHBonarius: LOL!!! My legends of code and magic bot doesn't compile anymore!
 JHBonarius: std::random_shuffle has been removed in C++17
 eulerscheZahl: RIP
 JHBonarius: tha's funny. code rot
 eulerscheZahl: C# is less prone to this kind of breaking change
 jacek: can there be nonrandom shuffle?
 JHBonarius: 2 years :skull:
 JHBonarius: Yeah: the dance
 jacek: quick sort dance?
 JHBonarius: Yeah, I know that one
 JHBonarius: it's std::shuffle now
 JHBonarius: but all stl stuff... non-optimized...I can't remember... was algo speed important for LoCM?
 eulerscheZahl: let me know if your new submit reaches top100, then I'll index you
 eulerscheZahl: not that important
 eulerscheZahl: interesting: you say your bot doesn't compile anymore. but your arena version is still working
 JHBonarius: hmm, seems to work fine in IDE. My local build just fails....
 eulerscheZahl: ClosetAI
 eulerscheZahl: but no ML involved
 JHBonarius: No? I thought he was doing value training on simulated battles on a server?
 eulerscheZahl: he just ran millions of games where he played one card vs another while giving the same set of other cards to both bots
 eulerscheZahl: that's not machine learning
 JHBonarius: are we going to have that discussion? :rolling_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: or at least not my understanding of that term
 JHBonarius: I think it's ML, it's not a NN
 TheBlueBias: :popcorn:
 eulerscheZahl: want a different discussion?
 JHBonarius: training regression models is also a form of ML
 JHBonarius: git fun
 JHBonarius: new repo. trying to add files...
 JHBonarius: "unable to merge unrelated histories"
 JHBonarius: what? it's a new repo
 JHBonarius: trying to remove the .git directory
 JHBonarius: "you need administrator privileges to remove this" -&gt; ok elevate"denied.. you need permission from [local user] to remove this"wait what?:tired_face:
 JHBonarius: wsl2 rm -rf .git works fine...
 JHBonarius: you need to use wsl to do simple windows filesystem operations...
 JHBonarius: again "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories" vs code github integration sucks
 eulerscheZahl: why don't you just use the command line?
 JHBonarius: I should. I hoped VS cdoe would make life easier
 smallPPperson: #clash
 jacek: ML talking?
 jacek: why it keeps turning&#160;:( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/om3wud">https://streamable.com/om3wud</a>
 DomiKo: Tokyo drift all the time
 MSmits: my 7x7 c4 solver still going. I think it will be a full day
 MSmits: biggest solved by John was 8x8. That will indeed take a long time
 MSmits: nice drifting btw
 jacek: you dared to click my link
 MSmits: I trust you
 MSmits: I am naive like that
 TimothyAlexisVass: :peach:
 flame568: ok
 Ellain: sup guys, is it worth to learn concurrency? does anyone use threads here?
 Ellain: std::thread::hardware_concurrency() returns 8
 flame568: i am new
 JFB: jacek - are you schure that your bot can turn right? 
 jacek: right is for the noobs
 MSmits: yeah, if you make it work for left first, you can just add a minus sign to your program and it works for right turns too
 darkhorse64: MSmits: what if you made your TT size as a power of 2&#160;? You could get rid of the&#160;% and save precious ms
 MSmits: ah yeah that's true
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: where did that come from suddenly lol
 MSmits: random optimization advice
 MSmits: how would you do it with a power of  2 by the way? Just mask the higher bits?
 darkhorse64: I saw your TT implementation very late (completely out of sync with the chat) quite some time ago and forgot to tell you
 MSmits: ah ok
 darkhorse64: if SIZE is a power of 2, just and with SIZE -1 
 aangairbender: what is TT by the way?
 aangairbender: transposisiotn table?
 darkhorse64: yes
 MSmits: ok, will do that
 MSmits: probably will be negligible, but it's good to be thorough
 darkhorse64: A scarce ressource has a high value, ms are CG gold
 darkhorse64: :slight_smile:
 darkhorse64: file size too
 MSmits: int key = HashKey(boards[0], boards[1]) &amp; (HASH_CAPACITY - 1);
 MSmits: HASH_CAPACITY = 524288;
 darkhorse64: Correct
 MSmits: great
 JFB: Do you remember2^n up to n &gt; 19?
 UntitledEpicness: Yo
 darkhorse64: Was your previous 400K based on tests&#160;? Up to 2^31
 darkhorse64: Kidding
 MSmits: 400k was sort of based on test. I did not see much difference between 200 and 600k
 MSmits: plateau
 darkhorse64: Just in case 256k is enough 
 jacek: 640kb is enough
 MSmits: i guess i'll test it when i feel like testing
 MSmits: how do you know jacek?
 darkhorse64: jacek: I really hope you would say it
 aangairbender: guys you know how to use simd with rust on codingame?
 MSmits: it kind of depends on the game. C4 has a lot more expansions than yavalath, so more use of the table
 jacek: rust? D:
 darkhorse64: Sorry, aangairbender, I am C++ only with all due respect to Rust
 aangairbender: my rust code worked after first submit, my identical cpp code didnt work after hour of debugging
 TheBlueBias: I like rusty spoons. :salad:
 Sebastogne: i like you
 MSmits: i like me too
 JFB: MSmits: about 650 k said Bill Gates
 JFB: *640
 aangairbender: :joy:
 Asuki: ```goHello```
 Sebastogne: x^2+1=0
 witer33: oke
 darkhorse64: aangairbender: Once you convince the compiler your Rust code is compliant, I feel your chances for something correct are greater
 aangairbender: darkhorse64 that's true:sweat_smile:
 MSmits: don't understand the bill gates reference
 aangairbender: seems like only sse and sse2 are supported (not avx, avx2, sse4.1)
 darkhorse64: MS-DOS time when you could not access more than 640K, Bill Gates said 640K would fulfill all your needs
 MSmits: ohh ok
 darkhorse64: We have all forgotten but programming on PC/MSDOS was nightmarish
 MSmits: ah i could not code back then
 JFB: we had lower expectations then darkhorse64
 MSmits: but just using a PC was nightmarish, so i can imagine
 JFB: first turbo pascal looks as some kind of magic - it was soooo fast - you write code, press one button and have running program.
 MSmits: some PC's had a turbo button :P
 JFB: of course  in 1980s
 MSmits: I was always wondering why they had that. I mean why would you ever want it to be slow
 JFB: Yes - and you sometimes do not use it becouse same games run too fast with this button&#160;:-)
 dreadylein: legacy reasonses
 MSmits: ohh ok
 dreadylein: most software just run as fast as the cpu could execute it
 MSmits: so this was before they figured out how to not make game speed dependent on cpu speed
 dreadylein: not only games but yeah hehe
 MSmits: this is a funny game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/587388854">https://www.codingame.com/replay/587388854</a>  Two bots same code. Red solves as loss, then blue makes a mistake and it becomes a draw. That's mcts randomness for you
 JFB: playing digger (pac-man clone) on 386 was a purely random game (for speed reasons) 
 MSmits: it should have been possible to introduce time.sleep(x) lines into the code to slow it down to match your cpu 
 MSmits: they could even have made a game menu setting where you could manage the speed like this 
 JFB: of course - but I have has only *.com (or *.exe - I do not remember) so you have had to disssemble to add sleep 
 MSmits: ahh
 JFB: it was pirates copy of course 
 MSmits: naturally
 struct: hi
 aangairbender: hi struct
 Kepe55: Any good online whiteboard you guys recommend?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://miro.com/signup/">https://miro.com/signup/</a>
 Kepe55: thanks, do you use that?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: miro give you 3 infinite boards for free
 DomiKo: you can share them to your friends
 DomiKo: and they work in real time!
 Kepe55: alr thx
 69razer69: noice
 TimothyAlexisVass: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8f4f7cf4-5c5e-4772-bc8f-77a5b12028d1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8f4f7cf4-5c5e-4772-bc8f-77a5b12028d1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 3 infinite boards you say :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: infinite is pretty big, i'm tempted to test that now
 DomiKo: I have one board for every CG game
 eulerscheZahl: *for those you played
 eulerscheZahl: btw your MPR bot is interesting. completely deterministic
 DomiKo: yeah it should be
 DomiKo: I'm doing depth 1 search + NN
 DomiKo: no random indeed
 eulerscheZahl: i assumed a neural network
 eulerscheZahl: my bot comparison spotted the deterministic behaviour
 DomiKo: :scream:
 DomiKo: that bot isn't great, but it require a lot of time to improve&#160;:( 
 eulerscheZahl: it's top40 at least
 DomiKo: without depth 1 It was like top120
 eulerscheZahl: that is depth0?
 DomiKo: yeah
 DomiKo: I believe I could code in C++ and results would be much better
 struct: wait this is true py3?
 DomiKo: yes
 struct: o.o
 struct: step 1 c++, step 2 avx, step 3 NN
 DomiKo: if I would do this for CG, then yes. But that was a project for uni
 DomiKo: that's why euler thought that magma is my second account, because its same code, but different NN
 struct: oh I saw that account somewhere
 struct: maybe on uttt or something
 DomiKo: yeah
 DomiKo: UTTT is a first task at acat lecture
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, it popped up here and I was confused as I didn't expect to find anything in a physics game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?game=coders-strike-back">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?game=coders-strike-back</a>
 TheBlueBias: Oya here
 eulerscheZahl: while others such as codebusters light up like a christmas tree
 TheBlueBias: What's your next planned contests eulerscheZahl?
 TheBlueBias: *are
 eulerscheZahl: maybe Coder One, not sure yet
 DomiKo: I love this one:
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?game=hypersonic">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?game=hypersonic</a>
 TheBlueBias: erf
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's just 1 bot. but random so it looks like it's a few different ones
 eulerscheZahl: i could keep regenerating games until it's all the same
 eulerscheZahl: it also has user profiles, if you click a nickname
 DomiKo: how you check this?
 eulerscheZahl: play bot vs itself. compare the gameplay (that is actual action, not output including message)
 eulerscheZahl: and of course i didn't play all these games by hand
 DomiKo: nice idea
 TheBlueBias: Hmm... And what are the RAIC date?
 eulerscheZahl: february
 TheBlueBias: Bwarf...
 eulerscheZahl: no more details known to me
 TheBlueBias: Don't even see that on the website...
 eulerscheZahl: yare probably around a similar date
 eulerscheZahl: they sent an email explaining that it's postponed until 2022
 eulerscheZahl: in Russian
 eulerscheZahl: i translate all those mails to make sure that I don't forget to claim my tshirt/hoodie
 TheBlueBias: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: they tend to ask you to enter your shipping address until date X
 eulerscheZahl: then at X+something they ask you again as there was a huge delay
 TheBlueBias: Icy
 eulerscheZahl: they save your inputs. but you still have to confirm them
 TheBlueBias: Oh? Bomberman is by team? 
 TheBlueBias: Or it's because you control multiple characters?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's still 1 vs 1 in terms of AIs
 eulerscheZahl: didn't read the rules
 eulerscheZahl: still in open beta. contest is planned to start on december 3rd
 TheBlueBias: Me neither. It's because of "Top 8 teams battle it out live on Twitch!"
 eulerscheZahl: with some prizes each month and a big finale later
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's the downside: they don't play tons of games for each bot
 TheBlueBias: I'll perhaps take a look so...
 eulerscheZahl: they launch the games manually. just a few of them
 eulerscheZahl: =&gt; more randomness
 eulerscheZahl: also knockout at the end
 eulerscheZahl: each vs each to determine finalists
 eulerscheZahl: (at least that's how it was last time)
 eulerscheZahl: i decided not to play. ValGrowth won. dapo 3rd
 TheBlueBias: I'll see. December is in a looooong time.
 eulerscheZahl: i know. i have no contest plans until then&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder marathon was too close to huawei
 TheBlueBias: The snake thing?
 adamgosnell: Hey everyone! I'm working on Horse-racing Duals, and I'm failing on test case #3 (Many horses). It looks like my code works, but the test is failing?
 adamgosnell: Can you explain what's happening?
 adamgosnell: Here's the error: FailureProcess has timed out. This may mean that your solution is not optimized enough to handle some cases.
 TheBlueBias: Yes
 Marcorvar: You may have too many for loops in place&#160;:)
 Press_F_to-Cesar: jojo
 adamgosnell: Thanks, bearnilu! I was sorting in a for-loop, was taking to much time. 
 Astrobytes: Press_F_to-Cesar: Do you honestly have nothing better to do than come here every day and talk about 'jojo' randomly without ever doing anything else?What is your major malfunction?!
 bearnilu:&#160;:) you are welcom
 eulerscheZahl: have you heard the story about the ship that had jojos loaded? it sank 207 times
 SunnyGiant_e433: Hi I am working on "There is no Spoon - Episode 1" and I get the following Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur. The test case is failing...in my local IDE, the output stream is different...Any ideas?
 SunnyGiant_e433: I read all input before any cout statement
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: Oh I get it now, "yoyos"
 eulerscheZahl: i ruined the joke then&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: nah, I still groaned :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's the best reaction to a lame joke :D
 Astrobytes: exactly!
 jacek: oO
 jacek: is this jojo reference
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - what "open beta" contest have you talked about? By the way - congratulations on 2nd place in yare.io
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: gocoder.one
 eulerscheZahl: the Bomberland game
 JFB: OK. 
 JFB: Have you win etherum?
 eulerscheZahl: i got 0.3ETH as announced. already received it the day the contest ended
 jacek: only cg coins
 jacek: did you sell them
 eulerscheZahl: the main slowdown was that I had to figure out how to create a wallet. so huge shoutout to yare organizers
 eulerscheZahl: i kept it. and ETH is going up
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - delete this post (tax police is looking )
 jacek: &lt; Caturday&gt; 1 BTC - 61137 USD, 52505 EUR, 44437 GBP
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know how taxes apply in such cases
 JFB: ETH noit BTC
 jacek: its kind of correlated isnt it
 eulerscheZahl: it is
 eulerscheZahl: but I don't have 52505â‚¬ * 0.3
 JFB: 1 ETH = 0.06584403 BTC (actually)
 struct: not sure if tax is applicable but might be different in germany
 eulerscheZahl: also no idea about the huawei smartwatch. does that require taxes?
 eulerscheZahl: illedan had to pay when he received his 3rd price for Sogeti (the fantastic bits variation)
 eulerscheZahl: but that's Norway
 jacek: nandway
 eulerscheZahl: i know that you don't have to pay taxes in Germany if you win the lottery
 jacek: can i be your citizen plx?
 TheBlueBias: Viking gonna plunder...
 eulerscheZahl: just looked it up: when it's mostly luck-based you don't have to pay taxes (lottery, sports bets, ...)when it's more about skills, it seems that you have to pay
 struct: just say it was luck
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://taxfix.de/steuertipps/gewinne-bei-lotto-und-quizshows-versteuern/">https://taxfix.de/steuertipps/gewinne-bei-lotto-und-quizshows-versteuern/</a>not sure how reliable that source is
 JFB: In poland I think is around 20% tax from the lotery (it depend on the kind of the lottery)
 jacek: yare was rng?
 eulerscheZahl: there was a bit of RNG
 JFB: mam bÃ³l gÅ‚owy z nagrodÄ… z topcoder'a - na szczÄ™Å›cie dopiero w kwietniu 2022 - ale siÄ™ tego bojÄ™ bo mogÄ… mi zakwestionowaÄ‡ jak to zaklasyfikowaÅ‚em. Zobaczymy. Prawdopodobnie jak bym dostaÅ‚ cryptowalutÄ™ to bym tego nie zgÅ‚aszaaÅ‚
 JFB: Sorry
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, yes
 eulerscheZahl: kick next time&#160;;)
 jacek: oO
 JFB: I have a headache with a topcoder award - luckily not until April 2022 - but I'm afraid of it because they might question me how I classified it. We'll see. Probably, if I got a cryptocurrency, I would not report it 
 eulerscheZahl: not telling anyone about it makes life easier
 JFB: ye
 JFB: best way not telingg - is telling in CG chat&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: good thing that I never leaked my real name :see_no_evil:
 JFB:&#160;:-D
 JFB: and address&#160;:-)
 struct: just tell dbd r to delete the logs
 JFB: or all internet (delete)&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: i'll do where facebook failed
 JFB: it looks that fb have new fail everyday
 jacek: fantastic bits is alright
 JFB:&#160;:-D 
 eulerscheZahl: as long as it's still "fantastic bits" :imp:
 jacek: any copyright there?
 jacek: because its abbrevation is fb?
 bearnilu: lol
 eulerscheZahl: JFB might not get that joke. CG is renaming some games. like CSB =&gt; mad pod racing
 JFB:&#160;:-) 
 TheBlueBias: Frodo Baggins
 eulerscheZahl: Fantastic Beasts
 TheBlueBias: For Beer!
 JFB: So was my surprise today - I saw post about mad pod racing - and replay from CSB
 eulerscheZahl: Tron =&gt; Line Racing
 eulerscheZahl: Skynet =&gt; Death First Search
 JFB: Really?
 jacek: onitama =&gt; ban?
 eulerscheZahl: and 1 more puzzle was renamed, what was it again?
 jacek: batman?
 eulerscheZahl: they won't handle community contributions for now
 TheBlueBias: Tron =&gt; Blaise's Line Crossing
 JFB: Maybe some copyrigt problem?
 eulerscheZahl: Thor artwork
 jacek: didney
 eulerscheZahl: it's all about copyright, yes. getting into the US market with that acquisition
 JFB: Nobody wants to go to court with Disney for CSB 
 eulerscheZahl: last crusade =&gt; the fall
 JFB: copyrgth law === the big evil 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2VxpTMAbas">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2VxpTMAbas</a>
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 JFB: But with fantastic bits it looks that facebook plan to change its name. I thought that change is due to "image problems" but maybe it is due "fantastic bits"&#160;;-)
 AllYourTrees: no ifs ands or bits about it
 struct: what was csb copying?
 eulerscheZahl: empire strikes back
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: read mods channel, contains valuable hints for people like us who aren't that firm in cinematic questions
 AllYourTrees: okay color me confused... i added selecting a random child 75% of the time in MCTS in C4 and its beating smits :thinking: with no random moves it loses...
 struct: retrain your NN
 struct: They will need to change the links too right?
 jacek: mods channel?
 struct: yes #mods
 eulerscheZahl: the one you decided not to join
 JFB: AllYourTrees - maybe random moves confuse smits' bot - its think so long that it is timeout&#160;;-)
 AllYourTrees: lol
 eulerscheZahl: or you found a way around his opening book
 jacek: for uct i have random [0.9,1.1] * eval + C * sqrt(...)
 AllYourTrees: oh ya the opening book, good point
 AllYourTrees: oh thats cool jace ty for sharing

 jacek: i need to be more patients. 100th vs 1000th generations. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/p3jd28">https://streamable.com/p3jd28</a>
 jacek: at first i put more emphasize to just finish the games, then when most games are finished, the fitness for duration kicks in
 jacek: maybe thats why it keeps steering into one direction
 struct: i added your rng thing and finally I can win some games vs NNs
 jacek: huh
 struct: i made my selection a bit random sometimes
 jacek: but pure mcts is inherently random, no need for that?
 struct: maybe its just rng from submit
 jacek: maybe you need more exploration
 JFB: jacek - this racing bot is NN or what? 
 jacek: my trials at NN
 Chelbeb_Mohamed: que pasa hejo de espagna&#160;?
 jacek: oO
 ja_fica: I have one question, is PUCT superior to UCT?
 jacek: PUCT requires policy probabilities no?
 jacek: its like comparing oranges to apples&#160;:?
 69razer69: i tried running the game template on eclipse and i got error caused by&#160;: java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException
 eulerscheZahl: interesting, i can't remember getting that error
 eulerscheZahl: which java version?
 69razer69: java.runtime.name=OpenJDK Runtime Environmentjava.runtime.version=16.0.2+7-67
 eulerscheZahl: that's a really new one. i use Java11 when I do anything SDK related
 struct: I use 8
 struct: also I dont use openjdk when I do sdk stuff
 69razer69: so its just a matter of dozngrading
 69razer69: *downgrading
 <b>**eulerscheZahl uses OpenJDK</b></p><p><img src="/a/61418101984360" /> struct: probably

 69razer69: popopipi
 eulerscheZahl: i kicked already
 KelvinAndHubbles: What is the timeout time set to?
 KelvinAndHubbles: Like 5 seconds or something, or does it vary
 69razer69: timout of wut
 KelvinAndHubbles: Like when you run a test case and it times out. 
 KelvinAndHubbles: How long does it run for before it throws timeout error
 struct: I think it depends on the puzzle and language
 KelvinAndHubbles: KK, fair enouigh
 TheBlueBias: But that's more about ms than seconds
 eulerscheZahl: for a classic text-based puzzle it's 1s I think
 eulerscheZahl: but different languages even have different timeouts i've been told
 jacek: handicap for python eh
 eulerscheZahl: you can bruteforce rollercoaster in JS but not in C++
 eulerscheZahl: take that!
 eulerscheZahl: struct can confirm
 struct: yeah
 struct: the js code can run up to 6 sec on that puzzle I think
 struct: while c++ has like 1 sec
 VizGhar: yeah but it looks more like a mistake from CG?
 TheBlueBias: CG makes no mistakes.
 eulerscheZahl: the different time limits are a feature
 VizGhar: o.O :D explain following contest then :D
 eulerscheZahl: research told them it's a good idea
 eulerscheZahl: only 1.64% are here for contests anyways
 TheBlueBias: Ultra accurate surveys
 cruelnerd: 31
 eulerscheZahl: 42
 TheBlueBias: 666
 SmokingJoe: does anyone here maybe has a c++ merger to upload a project as single file&#160;?
 TheBlueBias: I have
 TheBlueBias: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGppMerger">https://github.com/BlaiseEbuth/CGppMerger</a>
 cruelnerd: guys im noob  at devolopping. im stuck with doing these things.  Ä± feel like dumb, i cant even solve basic problems.
 SmokingJoe: ohh thx a lot
 eulerscheZahl: a c++ merger written in c++my C# merger is in python
 TheBlueBias: I'm a purist.
 aangairbender: SmokingJoe there is codingame-merge npm package
 TheBlueBias: npm :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: npm package for C++ bots?
 aangairbender: at least its easy to use
 aangairbender: my c# merger is in c#
 eulerscheZahl: mine is just a few lines that I run on compilation
 aangairbender: I analyze namespaces and usings as well
 eulerscheZahl: i do the same for usings, making them unique and putting them at the top
 eulerscheZahl: i code without namespaces to solve that problem
 aangairbender: yeah same for uniqueness of usings
 TheBlueBias: I use it with CGLocal. So I can just click "build" in VSCode then click run on CG.
 eulerscheZahl: also constructs likeusing(IDisposable someObject)would get mistaken for a library import
 aangairbender: visual studio creates namespaces by default, so they are supported
 eulerscheZahl: i just delete them when I create a new file
 eulerscheZahl: my script might work with namespaces but i don't see a need to have them
 eulerscheZahl: only adds an extra level of indent, overkill for small projects like CG bots
 aangairbender: I guess if using namespaces, there is extra indentation before using(disposable)
 aangairbender: so following line.StartsWith("using") wont detect it
 eulerscheZahl: same. but if i would try to trigger it with bad formatting, my merger could break
 MSmits: I write 3k line bots in 1 file :grin:
 MSmits: like a boss!
 TheBlueBias: And you pay for papers. What an example for children...
 MSmits: there was *1* paper :rage:
 TheBlueBias: :smirk:
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: was a totally useless paper too
 MSmits: did not know that until after i paid 10 for it
 struct: you write everything in the same file? o.o
 eulerscheZahl: you paid 10 what?
 TheBlueBias: bc
 eulerscheZahl: 10ETH? that would be expensive
 eulerscheZahl: bc? you mean BTC?
 TheBlueBias: Hm. Yes
 eulerscheZahl: but smits also learned to just ask the author. that way you get the paper for free
 derjack: :tada: passed SR. no simulation, just put inputs to NN and got outputs
 struct: nice
 DomiKo: good job
 derjack: it wasnt trained on testcases nor validators*

 Queuebee: is `exec(bytes('ç ªã´¬æ¥¦ç‘¬`... allowed in 'shortest mode` clashes?
 Queuebee: i keep getting beat by people who do that
 TheBlueBias: Yes
 Queuebee: REeeeeeeee
 eulerscheZahl: is it ok to kick/ban a user just because of the nickname?
 eulerscheZahl: NIgga2 please change it
 TheBlueBias: Why?
 TimothyAlexisVass: I think exec(bytes... should not be allowed&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: are you trolling TheBlueBias?
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 eulerscheZahl: who shall prevent it?
 TimothyAlexisVass: CG...
 eulerscheZahl: that would turn into whack-a-mole
 Queuebee: the judge
 Queuebee: :D
 eulerscheZahl: if you disallow exec in on way, a user will find a similar way to do the same
 Queuebee: truetrue
 TheBlueBias: Because nigga is different of nigger...
 eulerscheZahl: there's even a tool for that: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>

 adamgosnell: Is it weird that I'm disappointed when the top-rated solutions solve it the same way I did?
 TheBlueBias: For one time that I was not trolling...
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: scrabble seems a million times more dangerous than those other titles
 eulerscheZahl: it's on the list too
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested scribble. astro wants "words without friends"let's see what CG takes
 Westicles: Hasnobro?
 jacek: those with small horses?
 Westicles: I guess chuck norris goes as well?
 TheBlueBias: Chuck Norris isn't copyrighted, that's the copyright that's Chucknorissed.
 eulerscheZahl: i won't leak the complete list now
 Westicles: The new masters must be pretty paranoid.  Everything besides scrabble seems to be fair use
 Westicles: And my avatar is copyrighted, that should go as well
 jacek: ban copyrigthed avatars
 jrke: looks like the pretty id doesn't got changed
 jrke: the last part of link still has old name
 Astrobytes: it will change at some point
 TheBlueBias: Yup. When they will have found how to change it without broke the entire website. :smirk:
 struct: soon all board games are gone 
 Astrobytes: Nah. Just rename. Cheese, Mothello, Grapethrough, Peckers, Yavalaff etc
 Westicles: oops, avatar is trademarked
 Westicles: IANAL
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: UANAL? :smirk:
 struct: on the board games I do think the names can be copyrighted 
 Astrobytes: A few of them do have permission from the creators though
 Mega_Awesome: how do you take a square root in Java?
 Astrobytes: Math.sqrt()
 Mega_Awesome: also, is there an easier way to square something than multiplying it by itself?
 nathanstephenson: If a problem gives me a normal for(i) loop, why does it time out just iterating over that...
 adamgosnell: Mega: the ** operator, I think?
 Mega_Awesome: thx and thx
 adamgosnell: nathansteohenson: this just happened to me. It's because I was doing too many operations within the for loop. 
 adamgosnell: I need to ask a question about Shadows of the Knight Episode 1 optimizing, can someone helpful DM me so I don't spoil?
 Mega_Awesome: ** does not seem to work
 nathanstephenson: adamgosnell: I need all of the operations though, and there aren't many
 jacek: Math.pow(x,2)?
 Mega_Awesome: ill try it
 Mega_Awesome: I think its working
 adamgosnell: ** is equivalent. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp</a>
 adamgosnell: x ** 2 = Math.pow(x,2)
 jacek: he meant java
 Astrobytes: Java not js
 Astrobytes: x*x is sufficient surely...
 adamgosnell: oh. My bad. 
 Mega_Awesome: x is a bit long and i like things to be somewhat neat
 Mega_Awesome: I assume there is a floor function, could someone share that with me?
 Astrobytes: We're not a language reference...
 Mega_Awesome: oh...
 TheBlueBias: rtfm
 Mega_Awesome: where could I find this language reference?
 Astrobytes: You're familiar with a search engine I imagine...
 Mega_Awesome: yes, tho they are often of little help especially when you are looking for something specific
 Astrobytes: java manual/documentation/language reference perhaps?
 jacek: class Math has many those math things like floor ceil etc.
 MSmits: hey, I found that the draw trick is more general than just solving 2 generations upward. You can have whole chains just like ab... I need to figure out how to code it =/
 struct: you mean when you solve one node has a draw you need to check it up until root?
 MSmits: well depending on the situation of each node that could be true
 MSmits: you need to keep track of two properties
 MSmits: at minimum a draw, or at maximum a draw
 MSmits: when these are both set, it's a draw
 MSmits: it's equivalent to alpha == beta
 MSmits: when a node has a drawn child it is at maximum a draw
 MSmits: when a node has children that all have a draw, the node is at minimum a draw
 jacek: solve breakthrough. there are no draws there
 MSmits: you could propagate the max/min draw upwards
 MSmits: for a few generations, without finding draws
 MSmits: and then 5 generations upward, you find a draw because both min and max are set
 MSmits: it's like a whole different solver function
 MSmits: yeah bt is definitely easier&#160;:)
 MSmits: or just use standard minmax with ab and TT, that's also easier
 MSmits: anyways, i need to struggle with this math a bit and figure something out, then test it on the 7x5 case again to compare
 jacek: 7x7 done?
 MSmits: 1 starting move is, of the other 3 one is nearly done
 MSmits: so no, i am guessing halfway
 struct: how much time has it been running for?
 MSmits: 48 hrs total i think
 MSmits: 24 hr now
 MSmits: roughly
 MSmits: but this version is solved as a draw, says John. So that's why it's harder 
 struct: ah right
 MSmits: it's already bigger than 7x6 standard c4, but it being a draw makes it worse
 ja_fica: My current version of C4 is a UCT NN, now I will test PUCT, get ready to reck me xD
 MSmits: maybe it reks us all
 ja_fica: I don't think so, I trained it overnight
 Mega_Awesome: how do you turn 90.0 -&gt; 90?
 TheBlueBias: remove ".0"
 MSmits: string[0:length-2] I think?
 MSmits: something like that anyways
 TheBlueBias: Right
 Mega_Awesome: oh yeah, should specify, I'm using Java
 ja_fica: thats anoying in shortest mode python.
 MSmits: then you're doomed :P
 MSmits: well doomed as in i can't help you, maybe there's a java expert
 TheBlueBias: Probably better for him you can't help...
 Mega_Awesome: also there is a box obscuring part of the chat and there is no obvious way of removing it
 ja_fica: I don't know whu my PUCT NN is so bad&#160;:(, more training required, better data, different network...
 TheBlueBias: A box? Automaton2000 tidy your turtle collection :rage:
 Automaton2000: i mean, you have a look at the code and see if it is possible
 Mega_Awesome: I'm using a floor function and I think that might have something to do with it
 MSmits: Mega_Awesome a box?
 MSmits: like a html element?
 MSmits: use css positioning
 MSmits: j/k, i dont know what box you mean
 MSmits: maybe screenshot it
 Mega_Awesome: <img alt="Screenshot 2021-10-23 3.20.57 PM.png" />
 Mega_Awesome: did that work?
 MSmits: eh no, i meant like a printscreen posted to imgu
 MSmits: imgur
 TheBlueBias: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: (avoiding including personal stuff)
 Mega_Awesome: I have to post a msg just to see yours
 Mega_Awesome: don't know what imgu is
 MSmits: the box is blocking the bottom&#160;?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/">https://imgur.com/</a>
 Mega_Awesome: dang school restrictions
 MSmits: tell me about it
 jacek: those teachers eh
 MSmits: teachers aren't the one doing it
 TheBlueBias: Is there a cat in the box? If yes, is he alive?
 MSmits: he didn't say schrÃ¶dingers experiment was blocking the chat
 TheBlueBias: Well. You can't say if it's a schrÃ¶dinger experiment without opening the box... :3
 Mega_Awesome: there is no cat
 MSmits: are you say it's both schrÃ¶dinger's experiment and not schrÃ¶dinger's experiment until you look?
 jacek: no Caturday?
 TheBlueBias: Incertitudeception
 Mega_Awesome: and if there was a cat it would be both dead and alive
 MSmits: very meta quantum
 MSmits: Mega_Awesome not after you look
 TheBlueBias: Well. You can't measure to property at the same time.
 TheBlueBias: tired...
 TheBlueBias: *two properties
 MSmits: sure you can, depending on which properties they are
 MSmits: you can't know both momentum and position at the same time, but you can know other things at the same time
 MSmits: like charge and position
 MSmits: or momentum and spin
 TheBlueBias: Oh.
 darkhorse64: MSmits: read Score Bounded Monte-Carlo Tree Search for draws
 TheBlueBias: Free paper?
 MSmits: yeah i remember that one from a long time ago. Thanks for reminding me darkhorse64
 jacek: Mr. Heisenberg is driving on the free way and a police officer stopped him for speeding. Officer walks up to Heisenberg's car and asks him, "Sir, do you know how fast you are going?" Mr. Heisenberg said "Officer, I have no idea how fast I am going, but I know exactly where I am."
 MSmits: haha i know that one, still funny&#160;:)
 TheBlueBias: :3
 MSmits: Pessimistic and optimistic bounds
 darkhorse64: Yes, it's free with somewhat readable pseudocode 
 MSmits: thats the min draw and max draw idea i had
 Mega_Awesome: the box is white and it says "Changes done? Run your code when you think you have found the right thrust to win the race."
 TheBlueBias: Lel
 darkhorse64: You have to change your node to include two status
 MSmits: 3 i think
 TheBlueBias: A wild tutorial appear.
 MSmits: well you can do two if the final status is given by min == max
 MSmits: but then to find the final status you need to do a min == max check to see if it is even solved
 darkhorse64: yes
 Mega_Awesome: yes, it is the tutorial thing-a-majigar
 TheBlueBias: Mega_Awesome: Did you simply tried to refresh the page?
 Mega_Awesome: yes
 Mega_Awesome: it just removed my progress
 Astrobytes: Isn't there a skip option?
 Mega_Awesome: no
 TheBlueBias: Not on CSB one iirc
 Astrobytes: Hm. Annoying.
 Mega_Awesome: I think I just have to win the race and to do that I must remove .0 from 90.0
 Astrobytes: (int)90.0&#160;?
 Astrobytes: or just change the variable to int?
 TheBlueBias: How do you get 90.0 in the tutorial? You just have to modify the output string...
 Astrobytes: isn't the one after that still a tut?
 Astrobytes: I can't remember back that far
 Mega_Awesome: I simplified my code and it worked
 TheBlueBias: Just push in arena and that's over
 Mega_Awesome: I was trying to make check distance with the pithago theorem  thing and change speed based on that but all I had to do was put " 70"
 Mega_Awesome: smh
 Mega_Awesome: sometimes I know too much...
 Mega_Awesome: and don't know enough, all at the same time
 jacek: oh my
 ja_fica: I adjust my exploration rate, now PUCT is good xD
 jacek: good for you
 Mega_Awesome: ok, so when you floor a sqrt how do you get it to out put x instead of x.0
 Mega_Awesome:&#160;?
 Mega_Awesome: or how do you just remove the .0 after the fact
 Astrobytes: (int)x
 Qarnax: hello world
 Mega_Awesome: ok, thx

 Mega_Awesome: Uh oh! This page doesn't want to work.
 Astrobytes: are you in school?
 Astrobytes: college/uni whatever
 TimothyAlexisVass: I work at the university&#160;:/
 TimothyAlexisVass: Does that count?
 TheBlueBias: If you are Mega_Awesome, yes.
 Astrobytes: Was talking to the other guy, might have explained his lack of access to the page that TheBlueBias linked
 Mega_Awesome: I'm on a Chromebook (quit judging me)
 LelouchVC2: i wasn't judging you until you said you had a chromebook
 Mega_Awesome: exactly
 Mega_Awesome: thats why I included it in the msg
 LelouchVC2: because u wanted to be judged?
 Mega_Awesome: because I thought I might as well go ahead and tell you to stop judging me
 Mega_Awesome: before you even start
 TimothyAlexisVass: It's fine if you have a Chromebook
 LelouchVC2: if you wanted me to stop judging before i began you should have reordered the sentence
 LelouchVC2: Stop judging me, i'm using a chromebook
 Waffle3z: can I make the auto-indent stop using 4 spaces instead of 1 tab?
 TimothyAlexisVass: People used to think those who had Apple computers were idiots... I remember one guy saying something at work a few years back "Hey you know... I use Apple because I like it when things just work you know?"
 LelouchVC2: they aren't idiots?
 Waffle3z: also can I make tab stop using 4 spaces instead of tab?
 LelouchVC2: i dont believe so waffle
 Waffle3z: that's 3head
 Mega_Awesome: I am getting the impression that this boss has an advantage...
 Zakiyys: its hard
 TimothyAlexisVass: Waffle: Where are you trying to replace tabs with 4 spaces?
 Waffle3z: you that read backwards
 Mega_Awesome: *replace 4 spaces with a tab
 TimothyAlexisVass: You want tab instead of 4 spaces?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Why?&#160;:\
 LelouchVC2: The editor on here automatically puts 4 spaces whenever it would normally be just a single tab
 LelouchVC2: Python code golf would benefit
 LelouchVC2: Shortest mode with python would benefit
 Waffle3z: have to copy and paste a tab if I want it to not use spaces. but then enter automatically indents the next line with a bunch of spaces
 TimothyAlexisVass: Use spaces instead of tabs.
 Waffle3z: no
 LelouchVC2: Lmao, what a solution
 TimothyAlexisVass: Why not?
 TimothyAlexisVass: :D
 Mega_Awesome: be miserable
 LelouchVC2: dont use an proper editor, code on notepad
 LelouchVC2: because why not
 TimothyAlexisVass: I think default in editors is 4 spaces&#160;?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Or am I quick to change it? :sweat_smile:
 Mega_Awesome: I should probably do that essay that I'm supposed to  be doing right now...
 TimothyAlexisVass: -_
 Mega_Awesome:&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: I've never seen an editor that requires 4 backspaces to remove a tab before
 LelouchVC2: That seems like the wrong assumption to make about editors
 Waffle3z: how about 4 left arrows to move back 1 level of indentation
 Waffle3z: morally corrupt
 LelouchVC2: Its obvious it just adds 4 spaces, it highlights 4 characters when you highlight what should be a tab
 Mega_Awesome: He doesn't want to click &lt;- 4 times
 Astrobytes: if you're golfing python just replace the tab with 1 space, it's quite simple
 Waffle3z: golfing using spaces because spaces are smaller than tabs
 LelouchVC2: Its a waste of time, there's no reason the editor shouldn't be counting tabs as a single character to begin with
 Astrobytes: if the tabs are spaces then using a single space makes sense
 Westicles: write up your tab proposal and print it out and staple it to trees around your neighborhood
 Waffle3z: it does count tabs as a single character, it just doesn't put a tab when you press tab
 LelouchVC2: sure, but it looks horrific and you have to go back and do it afterwards
 TimothyAlexisVass: Well maybe you have a point
 TimothyAlexisVass: Then
 TimothyAlexisVass: It would be nice to golf with tabs
 TheItalianGuyMIO: ahah, would be great&#160;:) 
 TimothyAlexisVass: -_-
 LelouchVC2: I'm going to write a 10 page essay on this matter and staple it around westicles' neighborhood

 TimothyAlexisVass: I completed this clash...What's the trick?
 TimothyAlexisVass: You are given a number n and a prime number p.You must tell the greatest power of p that divides n! (where n! is the product of all positive integersâ©½n).
 Astrobytes: I mean seriously
 TimothyAlexisVass: obviously n! was something like 1389472893471238957123895792385612346123897412389751238956237846123897412389712385723569238478923

 Westicles: I just put book titles for reverses since they don't get shown 
 struct: use ruby
 Waffle3z: you already have the number mostly factorized, use that
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 TimothyAlexisVass: How are you suppose to find the highest power of P that divides N! when N=100000 and P=997&#160;?&#160;:\
 struct: what was the puzzle?
 Waffle3z: count the number of times 997 shows up as a factor
 struct: can you quote the statement?
 TimothyAlexisVass: What do you mean Waffle3z?
 TimothyAlexisVass: N! is like...
 TimothyAlexisVass: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3956cf92-1d80-457a-afa2-4ca02b745dff">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3956cf92-1d80-457a-afa2-4ca02b745dff</a>
 Westicles: 997 is prime so you just count the multiples
 TimothyAlexisVass: But N! is like a gazillion digits long
 TimothyAlexisVass: oh
 Waffle3z: you have the factors already
 TimothyAlexisVass: *facepalm*
 TimothyAlexisVass: so only have to count the factors that divide by P
 TimothyAlexisVass: from 1 to N

 TechnoBot:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Close the chat ffs
 TechnoBot: idk what u mean
 Astrobytes: "a lot of stuff is happeningpls keep it down"
 Astrobytes: dude
 TechnoBot: can u stop quoting my words pls?
 ipsissimus: some people cant handle the neutron style
 Astrobytes: you're sailing close to a kick
 Astrobytes: Anyway, someone else can do it. I have other things to do right now.
 ipsissimus: Python question. for anyone
 ipsissimus: can i rewrite the ending sum on 1 line?
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7353a046-4ab6-44a6-82f3-8ae0d3210414">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7353a046-4ab6-44a6-82f3-8ae0d3210414</a>
 ipsissimus: actually I know it can be done, but idk how
 Dren: probably turn it into a sum(map(function, list))
 Dren: where function is a lambda x: int(x,2)
 ipsissimus: so print(sum(map(function,list))
 ipsissimus: lamda functions always confuse me
 ipsissimus: also map here im not sure i understand what its doing
 Dren: and you can just unpack the string into a list with [*string]
 ipsissimus: hold up
 Dren: or [_ for _ in string]
 ipsissimus: i thought * only unpacked
 ipsissimus: lists
 Dren: nah I use it to transform things into lists all the time
 Dren: shorter than the list comp from
 ipsissimus: ya i seen witchcraft that i cant explain using * and everyone i asked said it was just for list unpacking
 ipsissimus: like for gen objects
 Dren: yeah to unpack things into a list
 Dren: heh
 ipsissimus: i need to play with it somemore
 Dren: so instead of list(filter) or list(map())
 Dren: you can just [*map]
 Dren: or [*filter]
 Dren: and unpack those
 ipsissimus: i need to read map documentation, it seems to have alot of different uses
 AllYourTrees: damn [*map] game changer
 AllYourTrees: TIL
 Dren: yeah because if you chain a bunch of functions like that and sort filter and map in one line constantly calling list() to turn it back makes it real long
 ipsissimus: ayy
 ipsissimus: i used *
 ipsissimus: for once
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72610ab1-5e1c-42e6-8fb3-944a19903e1c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72610ab1-5e1c-42e6-8fb3-944a19903e1c</a>
 ipsissimus: inb4 my code is trash and theres a better way
 AllYourTrees: did you want tips?
 ipsissimus: of course
 ipsissimus: i dont want to be trash forever
 AllYourTrees: n, r = map(int, input.split())
 ipsissimus: yes?
 AllYourTrees: yep!
 AllYourTrees: also recommend checking out list comprehensions
 ipsissimus: i have some basic list comprehensions, but i usually write out something as pythonically as possible
 ipsissimus: then refactor
 ipsissimus: with a comp if i can see one
 AllYourTrees: list comprehensions are very pythonic&#160;:)
 Dren: also that n loop just adds 0s?
 AllYourTrees: but that is fair i hear ya
 Dren: because you can just write [0]*n
 ipsissimus: yeah, because the range function fails with 0 as ending 
 ipsissimus: i was actually struggling with that
 ipsissimus: i know python can let you do str*3
 ipsissimus: to get str str str
 ipsissimus: but i blanked for when it was an int
 ipsissimus: and didnt think to convert
 ipsissimus: speed challenge u know
 Dren: yeah but ['a']*3 will give you ['a','a','a']
 ipsissimus: yeah i see that now
 ipsissimus: but it seems just different
 ipsissimus: not better
 ipsissimus: is it better?
 AllYourTrees: depends on what you are trying to do
 AllYourTrees: if yuo're trying to do the min code size thing then yes&#160;:)
 ipsissimus: well by better i mean, faster and less space
 ipsissimus: memory*
 Dren: well you are looping through a range and adding things one by one
 Dren: and this is a simple operation
 Dren: I assume it's faster and less memory but I haven't actually benched it
 ipsissimus: that makes sense
 ipsissimus: i know i should avoid loops if possible
 ipsissimus: as they can get quadratic fast
 Dren: in the code you sent I would also remove the print from the conditional and just stick it at the end once.
 ipsissimus: yes. 
 ipsissimus: speed challenge isnt good for my brain and optimization
 Dren: but that's just a small thing here
 ipsissimus: i feel like im developing bad habits with shortest challenge and speed challenge
 LelouchVC2: dont worry, you are
 ipsissimus: lmao
 ipsissimus: ive been indenting with 1 space
 Dren: yeah same
 ipsissimus: thats bad
 Dren: I can't help but want to write that whole thing in one line
 ipsissimus: people at my last company would flip their lids if my imports werent alphabetical
 ipsissimus: and yet here its like
 ipsissimus: you can save 1 char by not putting a space after: if 'k'in list:
 ipsissimus: after <i>*</i>
 Dren: actually the second for loop isn't needed either
 Dren: since you take every number in that range
 Dren: you can just create that list with [*range]
 Dren: and the conditional can be turned ternary
 Dren: once the code gets that small
 KayKay1202: Hello
 Andriamanitra: or list(range(x)) if you're not golfing
 ipsissimus: im going to need an example
 ipsissimus: because idk what u just said
 ipsissimus: remember
 ipsissimus: that was my first time using * and knowing what it was for
 Dren: print([0]*n if r==0 else [*range(0,n*r,r)])
 ipsissimus: this was someboyd elses solution:
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dec96859-2db8-4752-a9f4-b340de0b9514">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dec96859-2db8-4752-a9f4-b340de0b9514</a>
 ipsissimus: theyre smarter than me
 ipsissimus: and maybe i should ask
 ipsissimus: the reason why i incorporated a list at all
 ipsissimus: is because the answer was supposed to be space separated
 ipsissimus: so the first output was supposed to be
 ipsissimus: '0 2 4 6 8'
 ipsissimus: and i always run into the problem of having
 ipsissimus: '0 2 4 6 8 '
 ipsissimus: which has extra space
 AllYourTrees: `print(*[i*r for i in range(n)])`?
 Dren: yeah that seems to be it
 Dren: if you have trailing or leading white space you can just strip
 Dren: and if you only need it on one side you can target that too
 Dren: like rstrip() or lstrip()
 ipsissimus: ah rstrip()
 ipsissimus: i forgot
 ipsissimus: i tried strip but it obv gets rid of all my spaces
 Dren: but you can also just use strip unless you need the space on one side
 Dren: for example with justified strings
 ipsissimus: i usually get away with it by making a string
 ipsissimus: and print(str[:-1])
 ipsissimus: but that looks jank to me
 AllYourTrees: print(0, 2, 4, 6, 8) will give you space separated values, thats why the print(*[...]) works for ya there
 ipsissimus: yeah im trying to always stack my for loops in my prints now
 ipsissimus: but most of the time
 ipsissimus: theres some curveball
 ipsissimus: like i need to do some operation on each element
 ipsissimus: so that doesnt work
 ipsissimus: thats why im trying to read up on map
 Dren: you can map() for that
 ipsissimus: ya
 Dren: and lambda
 ipsissimus: map seems more manageable
 ipsissimus: than lambda
 ipsissimus: atm
 ipsissimus: for me
 KayKay1202: i know shes just not right for you
 LelouchVC2: She likes more rowdy men
 ipsissimus: maybe shes into wrinkles on the brain
 ipsissimus: not me
 ipsissimus: aerodynamic brain
 ipsissimus: smooth
 Dren: lambda is just a nameless one line function
 KayKay1202: i can treat you better than she can and any boy like you desevese a women
 KayKay1202: so i know that u wastin time when you could be with me instead
 ipsissimus: lamda for smooth brain? :grinning:
 Dren: def add(a,b): return a+bis the same aslambda a,b: a+b
 ipsissimus: i just have to remember lambda syntax
 KayKay1202:  Another Day please into night Fall and you're not here to get me through it all  i let my guard down and then you pulled the rug that he was getting kinda used to be someone you loved
 Waffle3z: I submitted a bot for counting tictactoe at wood 3 and walked away and now I'm wood 1, I missed all the wood 2 games
 KayKay1202: hey guys
 Dren: hey kay
 KayKay1202: dren do yuo type or read fast
 C26_1: um
 C26_1: I just want to ask a question
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 C26_1: Do we must say something naturally or we just need grammatically correct sentence?
 C26_1: I mean we still communication with each other when become a coder right?
 Thorcode: yep
 ipsissimus: bad grammar? straight to jail
 KayKay1202: Anybody do anything fun today
 Ruskin: Raining here, still in lockdown. More a of a day for clashes and work than anything else
 ProCoder03: is NZ still in lockdown&#160;??
 KayKay1202: WHAT IS NZ
 ProCoder03: new zealand
 KayKay1202: OH I AM STUPID
 ProCoder03: struct can we block person in private chats&#160;??
 struct: dont think so, who is it?  Can you pm me?
 struct: ProCoder03
 KayKay1202: ME
 KayKay1202: IT WAS ME
 struct: Well can you stop pming people for no reason?
 Ruskin: Auckland is still in lockdown, until we hit 90% vaccinated
 Thorcode: can I block pp in private? struct
 ProCoder03: nope 
 Thorcode: no
 Ruskin: I think we're about 89% rn
 ProCoder03: Ruskin sorry for that
 Thorcode: whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
 struct: Thorcode check pm
 Ruskin: Meh, used to it by now
 Ruskin: And we had a solid- 18 months without any restrictions, so it could have been a lot worse
 ipsissimus: you know how some problems give you a var assignment that you never use? how do i get rid of that input()
 ipsissimus: or throw it away
 ProCoder03: the irony is here, we are just some 57% vaccinated single dose, and people are back to normal 
 ipsissimus: for shortest code challenge
 Ruskin: You just have to input(), but do nothing with it
 Ruskin: No way round that afaik
 ipsissimus: ok ty
 ipsissimus: idk how u did the last one in 57chrs
 ipsissimus: im at 75 and trying to do all the tricks i know
 Ruskin: Hey, at least it wasn't Ruby. I can never understand anything that anyone does in Ruby!
 ipsissimus: ye, and they always share
 ipsissimus: to rub it in
 struct: Ruskin I think new Zeland is at 57%
 struct: 58.4

 struct: 87% on portugal&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: he is in auckland 
 Westicles: definition is changing though
 ProCoder03: maybe the city has 89% 
 struct: ah ok
 struct: Yeah doesnt seem very effective
 struct: we are still having 1000 daily cases
 ipsissimus: ruskin ive seen u do it twice now, what is the behavior or print(end) without a initial parameter?
 Westicles: you could die in a fire in the US and they put down covid
 ipsissimus: i only know print(x,end)
 ipsissimus: yeah i second what westicles said
 Ruskin: I think we're 89% on first doses. But we've only just recently had out big vaccine push, so second doses will go up rapidly in a week or two
 ipsissimus: flu taking a vacation this year
 Ruskin: I just use print(end=) so you don't get a carriage return
 ProCoder03: wait India is only at 20% :confused: 
 Ruskin: Means you don't have to build a list and then join() it
 ipsissimus: ok i understand
 bminnix: No no.  Flu is down because everyone is so precautious of COVID :rolling_eyes:
 ipsissimus: my friend died in a motorcycle accident. official cause of death: you guessed it
 bminnix: Sorry to hear about your friend
 ipsissimus:&#160;:/
 bminnix: Where I live people have just been going on about their lives for a while now.
 bminnix: Most not vaccinated, some are.  Most don't wear masks, some do.
 ProCoder03: Well in our country, its back like 2019... except for a mask at chin :joy:
 Westicles: they'll give us a break for a few months, then next year smallpox will be the big thing
 Westicles: or maybe ebola.  I always like that one
 ProCoder03: nah.... China has a new variant with it 
 KayKay1202: ipsissimus at least ur not the only persons whos friend died mine died of cancer
 Ruskin: Westicles, smallpox was eliminated. The vaccine worked
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/smallpox-preparedness-and-response-updates-fda">https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/smallpox-preparedness-and-response-updates-fda</a>
 ipsissimus: the existence of smallpox implies the existence of largepox
 ipsissimus: and normalsizepox
 Ruskin: Not sure what your point is. Smallpox was eradicated because enough people got vaccinated. I guess you're worried that someone could re-release smallpox on the world?
 Westicles: big pharm doesn't spend hundreds of millions on a new vaccine 'just in case'.  they made it, they'll find a market
 Ruskin: Well maybe, maybe not. I hope not. Meanwhile, I'm worried by people using arguments like this to minimise the threat of our current pandemic, and somehow argue against the simple mitigation measures (masks, vaccines) that we should be taking
 Westicles: I don't think we are going to agree, so I'll stop here :P
 Ruskin: Yeah, me too, I'm off to do some clashes. See you there?!
 bminnix: Aww man, I was hoping to see you guys finish that conversation, lol.
 bminnix: Just sitting in here like, :eyes:
 bminnix: :popcorn:
 KayKay1202: lol
 bminnix: The one thing found interesting was to see how people in the "We should be wearing masks to protect everyone else" camp get their vac and be like, "I know I can get it, I know I can spread it.  It won't make me as sick so I don't need to wear a mask".
 bminnix: And the government endorse that mindset by permitting vaccinated people to go maskless while enforcing masks on unvaccinated people.
 Ruskin: Which government does that bminnix?
 KayKay1202: i want a boyfriend so put on me im lookin for a person who can take my heat i need a rude boy tell me somethin sweet at the same tie

 ZarthaxX: i think there are magic numbers that can do that
 ZarthaxX: google it
 Nanosplitter: I can't find anything about magic numbers and bit flipping. All I see about magic numbers are "don't use magic numbers"
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: never tried that
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25750844/how-can-i-shuffle-bits-efficiently">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25750844/how-can-i-shuffle-bits-efficiently</a>
 ZarthaxX: i saw that page linked in answer
 ZarthaxX: it's crazy
 Nanosplitter: I'll work on trying to understand that, thank you lol
 Nanosplitter: Still new to doing bit stuff
 ZarthaxX: yeah well, bit permutation is not smth i tried ever
 ZarthaxX: there is byte permutation
 ZarthaxX: but that's smth else
 ZarthaxX: way simplerlol
 Nanosplitter: lmao
 superfx12: Maybe using a mask?
 Nanosplitter: superfx12 What do you mean?
 Nanosplitter: My friend just sent me this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/zyS2C1Dr">https://pastebin.com/zyS2C1Dr</a>
 Nanosplitter: I haven't tested it yet, but seems like it may work
 superfx12: What i meant was
 superfx12: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/723857fc-6864-4c2c-a496-542d2b093ca2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/723857fc-6864-4c2c-a496-542d2b093ca2</a>
 superfx12: then you could do AND 0011100 again to get the reversed
 ZarthaxX: that's just inverting the bits
 superfx12: And do AND 1100011 to get the res
 ZarthaxX: 00101 , i want to reverse that so 10100, but u are saying 11010
 superfx12: It was an exemple let me write it up in a doc tahn paste it here
 ZarthaxX: it wont work but ok
 superfx12: Ill just try
 Nanosplitter: Yeah, I'm wanting to reverse the bits, not flip them
 superfx12: Oh okay I think I understand, yep it wont work
 ZarthaxX: aaaaand f
 eulerscheZahl: and 0xF?
 ZarthaxX: funny
 ZarthaxX: is there a mod on? i need someone to get hammered
 eulerscheZahl: i think my chat history doesn't go far enough to guess who it is
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Radewoosh was online that night
 ZarthaxX: i meant you lol
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: :P
 eulerscheZahl: illedan climbed a lot during the night
 ZarthaxX: yes, impressive
 dbdr: it's as if he knew the game well
 kovi: radewoosh is still here
 eulerscheZahl: indeed, submitting
 dbdr: what about him?
 eulerscheZahl: a legendary grandmaster on codeforces
 ZarthaxX: a god basically
 kovi: yep
 dbdr: ok&#160;:)
 kovi: also was 2nd on locam sprint here
 dbdr: btw, is errichto a top player somewhere?
 kovi: yes, topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: codeforces, codejam
 kovi: and i think hashcode
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codejam/search/Errichto">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codejam/search/Errichto</a>
 dbdr: wow, you coded a tool for codejam too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: there is no user search on codejam
 eulerscheZahl: there was another site to search for users but they stopped indexing newer contests
 dbdr: that's the problem with  these tools, hard to maintain long term
 kovi: almost equality on top again
 dbdr: yeah, was just looking
 dbdr: top 2 a bit apart, but less than before, and variant for sure
 dbdr: we'll see a bit better when gold opens, to some extent
 kovi: im slowly running out of good ideasi mean most of them didnt help
 Zandy156: Wow .52 below bronze boss. I was planning on comparing code with my next submit, but I don't think I can now.
 eulerscheZahl: i still have a few points, my mine avoidance is still pretty poor
 kovi: (at least less than how competition improved)
 eulerscheZahl: but after that i'll struggle to improve as well
 kovi: i really wonder on gold recalc. even after 3 resub i cant tell the stance atm
 dbdr: legend is again sth like double of gold
 Zandy156: Is silence generally less effective at high rank? Or is frequent silencing still part of good strategies?
 eulerscheZahl: you need some silence for sure
 eulerscheZahl: not spamming, you need to find a balance
 eulerscheZahl: i think SONAR is the least important
 dbdr: "as little as possible, but not less"

 AntiSquid: RPS
 dbdr: a bot whose first move is to surface Search ResultsWeb results
 dbdr: copy paste fail :D
 eulerscheZahl: defaultAI is pretty strong, would reach silver without SURFACE
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl is he strong?
 eulerscheZahl: kidding, defaultAI is a noob
 dbdr: according to my tracker, he hit me perfectly when he had 43 possible locations for me
 dbdr: so just got spuer lucky?
 eulerscheZahl: targets the first possible location
 eulerscheZahl: lucky
 Csipcsirip: maybe he has a more advanced tracker :p 
 dbdr: ah, so top left is a bad place to be
 eulerscheZahl: it has a tracker but doesn't know the exact position of course
 dbdr: checks out
 eulerscheZahl: exactly :D
 kovi: silence0 is skipped probably
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, defaultAI doesn't know silence
 kovi: i mean, it maynot track silence at all
 eulerscheZahl: uses it but doesn't track opponent
 eulerscheZahl: and assumes top left corner initially
 dbdr: right, i used silence 0 here
 dbdr: the gods were against me in this one
 kovi: you need to add some variation early to avoid easy death to silver newbies
 kovi: force variation
 kovi: may not be true for higher leagues
 eulerscheZahl: in legend that problem will fix itself
 dbdr: thanks, I'll see if it's needed
 dbdr: after gold
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and gold is near
 eulerscheZahl: spoiler: we are in
 kovi: siman took the lead
 eulerscheZahl: and he pushed me back to #4
 eulerscheZahl: after kovi dropped me
 dbdr: did Csipcsirip share his joke with you kovi?
 kovi: not yet
 eulerscheZahl: a hungarian joke?
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: then i won't get it&#160;:(
 dbdr: siman means something in hungarian
 eulerscheZahl: smooth
 Csipcsirip: mm not exactly it means easily. 
 dbdr: yeah, it's kind of slang in that meaning isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: and then there is this user: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/447f8455a69ee26e0e6df8833f5684519084261">https://www.codingame.com/profile/447f8455a69ee26e0e6df8833f5684519084261</a>not sure if one has to be german to consider it a bad choice
 Csipcsirip: yes
 Csipcsirip: szerinted valaki meg fogja el≈ëzni kovit? szerintem siman!it was the joke btw :p 
 dbdr: it's very good&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: kovit = declinated kovi?
 dbdr: yes, object
 eulerscheZahl: accusative
 eulerscheZahl: or whatever cases you have in the Hungarian language
 dbdr: now now, let's not accuse kovi of anything too bad
 emh: Csipcsirip I thought it was dothraki
 eulerscheZahl: you only have subject and object, not a range of different cases?
 dbdr: but you're right, that's the linguistic term
 kovi: nice one csip
 dbdr: a lot more suffixes
 eulerscheZahl: i'm used to those from Latin
 dbdr: you can say a whole sentence in hungarian with a single word
 kovi: en forditva szoktam mondogatni siman megnyertem ezt a jatszmat
 dbdr: especially since "is" is left implicit
 dbdr: take a word, add suffixes for direction, posession, object, plural
 dbdr: that's at least 4, might be possible to do more
 dbdr: native speakers? kovi Csipcsirip?
 Csipcsirip: yes
 dbdr: i mean you can add all 4 suffixes at the same time
 kovi: there must be just a few nonnative hungarian speakers...
 dbdr: 33% on the chat right now&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: motivation to learn it is low, when you don't live there
 Illedan: Morning
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: nice progression Illedan!
 eulerscheZahl: congrats for getting a working bot Illedan
 Illedan: :rocket:
 dbdr: working = top 20 right?&#160;;)
 emh: so Hungarian is ideal for bit packing I guess with all those conjugations. no wonder people use Hungarian notation in programming hehe
 eulerscheZahl: just make sure not to become C# #1
 Illedan: Gimme a few days euler ^^
 Illedan: Me you and Zeno for that fight atm
 YannT: I think I've won first Kotlin :D
 YannT: mostly because no one does Kotlin
 Uljahn: i think the contest isn't over yet :smirk:
 YannT: siman did some tuning
 iFightLegends: How can I check the time it takes me to make an output in JavaScript since console.timeEnd() prints directly in the standard output and performance.now() is not working?Date.now(); seem not to be precise - it says it took me over 2 seconds, but that can't be because only 1 second is valid on the first turn and it still worked.
 Uljahn: start measuring the time after the first input
 Uljahn: To debug: console.error('Debug messages...');
 iFightLegends: Doesn't make much sense with Date.now() again - it says 0.08seconds... but after 50ms it should already timeout and I then I should't even had the time to print that.
 iFightLegends: although I just noticed: console.timeEnd() did print the same...so I guess Date.now() is precise after all - thx&#160;:)
 Palmipedus: is anyone using bitboard and mask?
 JBM: is anyone *not*?
 Palmipedus: I have some perf issues (too much list of small object)
 JBM: fuse them
 Palmipedus: I've never implement bitboard and mask, so I don;t really know where to start
 JBM: what's your small object?
 Palmipedus: coordinate (x, y)
 JBM: oh, wow
 JBM: ok
 Palmipedus: and I have list of coordinate for paths
 JBM: what's your container?
 JBM: if that's useful to you as is, just make an array of them
 Palmipedus: for the "simulation", I'm using BFS with a node  boject that has info about the state
 Palmipedus: for the parth I could allocate a array of 15*15 but I wonder is it will be faster
 JBM: well i'm not going to solve it all for you
 JBM: but the expected point of bitboarding is: smaller data
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search</a>
 JBM: or perhaps more accurately: more compact data
 Palmipedus: Uljahn good, it's in c++ but that would be useful for me 
 darkhorse64: add inherent parallelism
 Palmipedus: but it seems to only represent the map, what about the info for the visited, you'll need to pass it down
 Palmipedus: for each node
 Uljahn: you could modify the map i guess
 iFightLegends: thx4 the info about bitboards - I've never heard that term in my life, learned something new today :D
 sadek11: hello world
 emh: hmm.. for path reconstruction I guess there are at least two options. either do xor (symmetric difference of each generation) and reconstruct a path that way (but might have multiple choices). or use another bitboard with 2 bits per cell to indicate parent
 emh: I just ordered 1.5 kg of tea. mostly chili, licorice and other spicy ones. some new taste trials. should be enough for 4 months hehe. drank around 200g in last 2 weeks
 dbdr: emh again? :D going out fast
 emh: hehe yes. still have 300g but got addicted to this chili licorice which I am out of now
 emh: I also ordered a new one with 17% chili. should be spicy enough heh. and has like 10 other ingredients
 emh: called chiliform
 emh: chili, licorice, cocoa peels, mint, ginger, peppermint, nettle, black pepper, fennel, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and chili with seeds
 amurushkin: emh interesting tea. never see something similar at our shop. could you show a picture of the box?
 emh: amurushkin <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.med24.no/chiliform-te-100-g">https://www.med24.no/chiliform-te-100-g</a>
 amurushkin: could try to add chilie papper to my tea ))
 emh: hehe but don't add too much. I added a half fresh cut Carolina Reaper to my beer once. threw up after. twice
 emh: but the Reaper is special. world spiciest fresh one
 amurushkin: i dont have possibility to buy Carolina Reaper here ))
 emh: oh ok it was in the regular supermarket in Oslo once so I bought it. was cheap too
 emh: maybe you can order online
 amurushkin: I think i dont need it. The other pepper that i can bought and get on my garden is enough for me
 tobk: are you sure that's tea? maybe someone just put a pack of curry back to the wrong shelf...
 Quidome: why are you usinf BFS?
 AntiSquid: why would you put a carolina reaper in a drink?
 Quidome: I mean, for what  aspect?
 AntiSquid: Quidome BFS to find a path
 AntiSquid: for whatever reason
 Quidome: yeah sure, but I don't do lookahead at the moment
 Quidome: So I was wandering&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: stop wandering around, sit down and code&#160;:)
 Quidome: Don't sea an obvious purpose 
 AntiSquid: purpoise :p
 Quidome: you are doing BFS as well?
 AntiSquid: even Automaton2000's grandmother does
 Automaton2000: i want to use a spell not found on the chat.
 yfprojects: Which one Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: unless you have a list
 sadek11: hii
 sadek11: i need exc in datastructure help
 Tunga: Fixed some bugs, here we go, submitting!
 emh: tobk hehe
 emh: AntiSquid well we were drinking and eating reapers so the combination was obvious and alluring
 Tunga: We all need help budy, I also need help data structure too sadek11
 Uzay-G: when we submit our code for a league, the leaderboard is the leaderboard for that league?So if ur first in wood II that means ur submission did the best of all the wood |I submissions? I'm talking about Ocean of code
 Uzay-G: actually I'm good
 Uljahn: Uzay-G: if you're first in your league at 100% of the submit you'll get promoted to a higher league
 Uljahn: *first or above the boss
 Uzay-G: alright thanks
 MSmits: yay, looks like I'm getting into gold&#160;:)
 MSmits: finally started using mines today
 MSmits: note: do not try to lay mines on islands.
 MSmits: but even when trying to lay mines on islands, my bot was better than my silence/torpedo bot
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: really taking it slow this time around
 MSmits: I did my first google meet classes yesterday with headset and stuff
 MSmits: no camera, just shared powerpoint. It's kinda weird, you don't see anyone, so every one in a while I gotta ask: Ehh can anyone with a mike say something
 MSmits: Then they go "something". And I know they're still there
 ZarthaxX: mhm
 ZarthaxX: yeah there is a void
 ZarthaxX: i dont have to do virtual classes so dont know the feeling
 ZarthaxX: but can imagine :P
 MSmits: I wasn't planning to do it, was just gonna do google chat + youtube + assignments and feedback
 MSmits: but the boss said we had to&#160;:)
 MSmits: I can kinda see why, especially for the younger classes
 MSmits: sometimes they just need a live-teacher I guess and chat isnt enough
 ZarthaxX: yes
 ZarthaxX: the constant questions becomes a problem with the virtual class}
 MSmits: I get some questions, but the questions are public, mostly. The students are instructed to first check if their question has already been asked and answered
 ZarthaxX: how do they do that?
 MSmits: google chat has channels, for each class, everyone is added to a channel
 MSmits: to ask a question, they open a new discussion
 MSmits: the question and my answer, remains up
 MSmits: I also start each virtual class there. Everyone says hi, I note down their presence and then give them a google meet link
 ZarthaxX: oh ok
 ZarthaxX: and what do you think about this methodology
 ZarthaxX: better than normal classes?
 Keylan: Is there some flexibility in adjusting the interface that I might be missing?  I see the horizontal slider for adjusting the IDE - but would like to control some of the other areas too (like hiding instructions but still show the playback/video)
 ZarthaxX: like a possible future of education
 MSmits: ZarthaxX I think it has definite advantages, but also some limitations. I would like it if there was 1 live class and 2 virtual classes each week. But it might not be equally effective for every age-range
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: tru
 ZarthaxX: being in the house makes kids get distracted
 MSmits: live classes simply have far quicker interaction
 ZarthaxX: but could change 
 ZarthaxX: also that yes
 MSmits: I dont really have that problem, but some of my colleagues do
 struct: Keylan its quite limited, most of the users use external IDE with extension to sync
 ZarthaxX: maybe if you do a workaround about the lack of interaction
 ZarthaxX: it could be better
 Keylan: Thanks struct - I am using an external IDE but would like to see more of the log output alongside the video
 struct: Try CG enhancer
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441</a>
 MSmits: not sure how, you got 20-30 students hooked up to a google meet. No matter how advanced the program, it's always going to be less effective than a live classroom when it comes to interaction. You do lose less time to bad behavior with google meet though. 
 MSmits: You could just mute them :P
 Keylan: Thanks struct
 MSmits: also it is easy for students to sneak away and pretend to be listening
 MSmits: play games on phone instead
 ZarthaxX: i meeant use another platform MSmits not google thingy
 MSmits: thats why i said it depends on the age range. My students are 17 years old on average. Far more mature
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: sure, there might be improvements, but i find it hard to imagine a different platform having all advantages of a live classroom
 MSmits: it can get closer to that, sure
 ZarthaxX: yeah, hard to accomplish
 ZarthaxX: also helps to keep kids social in some way
 MSmits: yes
 ZarthaxX: and not be in their home all the time
 MSmits: cooperation is also a skill

 MSmits: probably restart the browser
 MSmits: you did too many hacky things
 eulerscheZahl: left and reentered IDE, not helping
 eulerscheZahl: restart it is
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 MSmits: weird, maybe if i restart its gone too

 MadKnight: Automaton2000 did u break something again&#160;?
 Illedan: Fine for me
 Automaton2000: but if i can find the motivation
 eulerscheZahl: did you reload the IDE Illedan?
 eulerscheZahl: *checks leaderboard outside of the IDE*what are you doing up there Illedan?
 Illedan: Doesn't work now
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: Dammit
 Illedan: why did I reload
 Illedan: :sob:
 eulerscheZahl: to verify my bug report
 eulerscheZahl: i pinged @staff on discord
 struct: seems like silver only
 eulerscheZahl: i just opened the IDE leaderboard to search for struct and see if you are in silver :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have a short attention span
 Illedan: lol
 MadKnight: fix your attention
 struct: bi
 struct: no
 struct: its all leagues
 struct: I ctrl + F5 and now it bugs for me too
 yfprojects: What bugs?
 MadKnight: leaderboard
 MadKnight: thibaud is on it
 struct: Its on all games
 yfprojects: i do see it, also after reloading
 yfprojects: Illedan is #45 right now, because of submitting
 Keylan: struct I have cgenhancer going and see most of the features, but full screen console doesn't seem to be happening - is there a trick?
 struct: I dont think it can go to fullscreen
 struct: but it becomes bigger right?
 struct: Or is the page like it was before?
 Keylan: layout is the same, leaderboard and some other small things are different
 struct: enable the sync
 Keylan: Yup, sync is enabled
 struct: The text editor should hide
 Keylan: I'll search around for bugs with the text editor not hiding
 struct: should look like this

 Keylan: Thats what I was hoping for yea, but text editor still there.  Layout is the same
 struct: What sync are you using?
 struct: CG sync or CG local?
 Keylan: Ah, whatever the native thing is
 Keylan: Didn't realize there were two options
 Keylan: The little settings window says CodinGame Sync at the top
 struct: hmmm, I don't know then, all I remember doing was installing and enable CG Enhancer script
 struct: and then enable the sync
 Keylan: you are also using CG sync?
 struct: yes
 Keylan: I will try turning it off and back on again =)
 Keylan: Ok - when I enable sync the layout changes briefly and then switches back, debugging

 YannT: enjoying my 15mn of spotlight while they come back :p
 dbdr: make it count&#160;;)

 Uljahn: are you in the same multi? :smiley:
 DavidJangdal: But, I have clicked the submit&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you didn't say you're playing the wrong game
 AntiSquid: you need to play ocean of code
 AntiSquid: and get an avatar for +5% win bonus
 eulerscheZahl: which game is it? coders strike back?
 eulerscheZahl: wood leagues are huge and you can only select top1000
 DavidJangdal: Back to the code
 eulerscheZahl: same problem
 eulerscheZahl: you can only fight top1000
 wlesavo: AntiSquid gimme an avatar
 AntiSquid: you have one
 AntiSquid: that's why you're so high on the ladder, see? it works wlesavo
 Uljahn: wlesavo: your avatar is quite good with +20% python skill bonus&#160;:)
 wlesavo: AntiSquid hm, but i would realy appreciate an additional 5%, would it help if i will set two avatars?
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo how about <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/yKGHaJZF2j/captain-garfield/">https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/yKGHaJZF2j/captain-garfield/</a>
 Uljahn: you can set the background
 wlesavo: euler blocked by our goverment, lol
 Uljahn: worked for me
 eulerscheZahl: or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/PjFY6336/pirate-cat/">https://drawception.com/panel/drawing/PjFY6336/pirate-cat/</a>
 AntiSquid: try this then wlesavo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/tmgMtFO.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/tmgMtFO.jpg</a> also a cat avatar
 eulerscheZahl: hm, blocked to i guess
 wlesavo: AntiSquid will i have to resubmit then?
 AntiSquid: idk, pray to the galactic spirit and hope you randomly end up in the universe with the best random seed for you&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or switch to C++ for speed boost
 wlesavo: will it also give me my 5%?
 blasterpoard: more
 YannT: speed is not of the essence currently really
 YannT: I typically answer in 0-5ms
 YannT: unless there's like silence spam bot, but then I just reset stuff so
 blasterpoard: = 0-500ms in python
 YannT: :grimacing:
 YannT: I know how I'm gonna make use of the time eventually, but for now I don't think anyone really does
 blasterpoard: I have a search that can use it, but it is capped at 10ms for now
 YannT: I found that if you prune the order combinations sensibly, there's really no need for the  time
 YannT: some combinations just don't make sense or are functionally the same as others
 eulerscheZahl: including the time when you placed a mine?
 eulerscheZahl: + location
 eulerscheZahl: the location is the important info actually
 blasterpoard: I'm not talking about the opponent's possible paths in previous turns
 blasterpoard: I'm talking about selecting your own path for the next turns
 dbdr: ver reminiscent of locam, the action earch
 dbdr: *very
 YannT: quite
 YannT: weirdly enough I did well on that one too
 blasterpoard: well, I guess I'm doing something completely different from the rest of the bots
 YannT: so that's either very good or terrible :p
 blasterpoard: looks good, considering that after ~30 turns the movements of my bot are random
 dbdr: what are you searching if it's random?
 YannT: I don't know if planning a path ahead makes a whole lot of sense given the uncertainty about a lot  of stuff
 YannT: by the time  you get there could be mines or a torpedo in the face
 blasterpoard: dbdr incomplete bot
 dbdr: ah right
 YannT: in the end I've become quite convinced that moving so as to minimize ennemy detection and mines is a whole lot more important than maximizing space use
 YannT: (don"t wanna run into corners if you don't have to, but a lot of the time the smart move would actually be to surface even if you technically don't have to, which is quite counterintuitive for an eval :p )
 blasterpoard: sure, my search is looking for paths that don't allow the opponent to find out where I am without sonaring/damaging me
 YannT: but mine laying by the opponent might screw up your path any turn?
 blasterpoard: I have a solution for that
 blasterpoard: current bot ignores all mines though
 darkhorse64: why surfacing is better&#160;? It gives vital info on your location, it costs a life and it does not prevent you for being impacted by mines
 YannT: actually it can prevent you from going into a mine field
 blasterpoard: also, the opponent probably already has that info
 YannT: sometimes you're better of surfacing and backtracking safe waters than going into the 20 mines your opponent put on his side
 YannT: also vis a vis detection, surface + silence can create a lot of incertitude than just silence on its own&#160;:)
 YannT: silence is max 3 directions by default, with surface 4, and depending on your previous pathing, maybe less
 YannT: so surface + silence makes you disappear really well and can allow you to avoid going into mines (which if there's a lot of less would be a lot more than just 1 dmg)
 darkhorse64: Make a lot of sense
 darkhorse64: *makes*
 YannT: yeah well, try explaining that to an eval function tho&#160;:/
 YannT: it's tricky
 Zenoscave: YannT do you sim?
 YannT: yeah
 YannT: 1-ply for now
 Zenoscave: huh
 YannT: plan for the future  is 1) rewrite a proper eval because mine is a mess and 2) do opponent turn&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445016025">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445016025</a> I was trying to figure out why I didn't silence after my 1st torpedo, and why yannt didn't fira a second one...
 blasterpoard: turns out my bot is smart xD
 YannT: I don't know why I didn't shoot you actually
 blasterpoard: figure it out
 blasterpoard: it will help you fix your bot
 YannT: no clue, I should've shot you on fram 144
 YannT: frame*
 YannT: I probably decided it would give my position away or something
 blasterpoard: nope
 blasterpoard: you didn't know my position
 YannT: idgi
 YannT: I did
 blasterpoard: (13 10) was my other possible position
 blasterpoard: you didn't know whether my, or your torpedo damaged me?
 YannT: 0ms) [OPPONENT] MOVE E =&gt; 1/1 [(11, 11)]
 YannT: not to me
 YannT: I *really* should've shot you
 blasterpoard: or at least, that's why my bot didn't silence
 eulerscheZahl: in most cases it's a valid assumption that players don't shoot themselves but get shot by the opponent
 YannT: my eval's a mess, it decided the loss in possible positions for me wasn't worth the torpedo (which is obviously wrong)
 icecream17: I should code for the case I have three lives and the opponent has 2 lives, and we're both on the same square
 YannT: that's why I wanna rewrite it, sometimes it falls on the wrong side of things
 blasterpoard: and, unlike my bot, you actually saw the hp (not) change between the torpedos
 YannT: yeah my tracking is top notch, I know for sure where you are, so I properly evaluate that torpedo as a guaranteed 2 damages
 YannT: just decided it wasn't worth it because it would give my position away :p
 karliso: One could damage himself to confuse opponent? Nice.
 blasterpoard: so my bot should have silenced from (11 11)
 blasterpoard: I should fix that eventually
 YannT: yeah dunno why you have two positions on that frame
 YannT: I guess that requires the assumption that you wouldn't shot yourselmf
 blasterpoard: yes
 YannT: (not actually possible in the case of torpedoes that don't overlap anyway so not a factor here)
 blasterpoard: you couldn't know whether I went S1 or E? from (8 8)
 blasterpoard: [8 8]
 YannT: 2 torpedoes, 2 damage each, no overlap, means either we both shot ourself right in the face, either both torpedoes landed
 YannT: either way there not really uncertainty there&#160;;)
 blasterpoard: my bot just makes absolutely no assumptions xD
 Zenoscave: so landing torpedos for 1 hp is not good anymore?
 blasterpoard: Zenoscave depends
 YannT: well you should probably assume you wouldn't self torpedo for 2 damage :p
 Zenoscave: self torpedo?
 YannT: no it's good
 YannT: you don't really use torpedo for sonar anymore tho yeah
 YannT: too costly for little upside
 blasterpoard: btw EESWSWNWSSSENEENEN was the result of my search from [8 8] in that game
 blasterpoard: that's the 10ms search that I do xD
 YannT: I should've won this if eval didn't decide a 2 damage torpedo was too good for it :p
 blasterpoard: well... I finished with 3hp
 YannT: yeah well, -2 if a shot and then the mine, you dead
 blasterpoard: yes
 karliso: Are you guys doing multi-turn simulations?
 blasterpoard: also the [14 10] torpedo should give away my position, now that I think about it
 blasterpoard: becuase otherwise I'd shoot your face
 blasterpoard: karliso I have something, but it's still under development
 codefreak288: hey bitcheshow u all
 YannT: I really need to rewrite this eval... 2dmg guaranteed torpedo, doesnt do it, this is  preposterous
 YannT: I'm going to  have a talk with its manager
 ZarthaxX: ban
 dbdr: YannT, dying undetected, that's the holy grail&#160;;)
 YannT: apparently&#160;;)
 YannT: but  if I yank up  to reward for torpedo too much, I end up with a coked out bot that does stuff  like SILENCE 4 into a corner just for the chance to put one in sooo
 YannT: it's a balance
 kovi: selfdamage is gold idead, or is it legend?
 icecream17: i think some people will just account for that
 blasterpoard: kovi wood
 Zenoscave: def wood
 kovi: i did no damage in woods
 icecream17: what? then how did you win
 kovi: silent only (crash or enemy run out of space)
 YannT: aka the Saelyos strategy
 YannT: good bot for stress testing :D
 MSmits: oh... I think I am still triggering mines I am in range of :P
 MSmits: I don't hit myself with torpedos, but forgot I can do this with mines too :P
 YannT: good for  screwing upo ennemy detection
 YannT: it's the shot self in the arm  to  throw the police off track method
 Zenoscave: Doesn't work if youre still holding the gun&#160;;)
 MSmits: YannT only if the enemy detection is bad
 MSmits: it won't screw my detection
 MSmits: shoot yourself all you want&#160;:)
 dbdr: at some point there can be a tradeoff between perfection (conservative) and heuristic (prunes more and correct in x% of the cases for x high)
 eulerscheZahl: gold!
 ZarthaxX: lol gold
 MSmits: nice
 kovi: 38.09
 MSmits: the mittens come off now!
 kovi: finished with same score 
 kovi: siman egyenlo lett
 karliso: What techniques are used to simulate incomplete information games?
 MSmits: random with probability
 MSmits: but not on this contest
 MSmits: here the posssibilities are the perfect information
 wlesavo: in the mid of my submit lol
 pb4: oh shit
 icecream17: Gold????
 MSmits: so it's not your typical game with incomplete information
 icecream17: Oh noooooo
 pb4: I'll be late to gold, won't have all the games&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: I JUST RESUBMITTED
 wlesavo: pb4  same (
 dbdr: noobs&#160;;)
 pb4: hey at least I can say I'm first :D
 eulerscheZahl: the new league always opens around the same time
 Zenoscave: I thought we had another 50 minutes
 MSmits: dudes and dudettes... this is not your first contest :P  you know it starts at 6
 dbdr: does it matter pb4?
 Zenoscave: oops off by an hour
 eulerscheZahl: i can understand that wlesavo submitted but the rest should know better
 karliso: MSmits Do you mean one should treat this game as perfect information game when simulating?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl #1&#160;;)
 wlesavo: first for me, yeah
 ZarthaxX: screenshot toad
 icecream17: Cpt. Haddock?
 MSmits: yes you should, but the perfect information tells you all the positions the opponent sub can still be at. It's a different kind of perfect information
 icecream17: Is that from the username or just random
 eulerscheZahl: not first on my laggy leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: but new league opening isn't a screenshot reason anyways
 dbdr: it is on my IDE
 dbdr: global is not refreshing
 MSmits: I wouldnt consider it incomplete information, because games like that are typically different.
 dbdr: ah it just did
 MSmits: in most incomplete information games, you know everything except 1 or 2 things. In this game the entire point is eliminating possibilities
 wlesavo: oh, at least we can deduce silver bot by its MSG
 Swagboy: MSmits, check kriegspiel
 eulerscheZahl: what langauge is the bot?
 Swagboy: A prussian chess game with really incomplete information considered as such in research papers
 wlesavo: c#
 Zenoscave: c#
 eulerscheZahl: shouldn't it be Kriegsspiel with a Fugen-s?
 dbdr: does not sounds like a strong definition MSmits
 MSmits: it's not, but I am trying to get across that this is not your typical incomplete information game
 dbdr: it's not incomplete because incomplete is only incompletely incomplete?&#160;;)
 MSmits: right :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445032818">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445032818</a>
 dbdr: what's typical for you?
 eulerscheZahl: from the message that might be it
 MSmits: like UTG, halite
 Swagboy: Kann sein eulerscheZahl&#160;!
 YannT: looks like they took top100 or thereabouts then?
 MSmits: starcraft
 MSmits: also wondev woman
 izik1: free gold wut
 eulerscheZahl: legend won't be for free
 eulerscheZahl: but hard work
 MSmits: depends entirely on how they choose the gold boss
 pb4: Where's the boss gone&#160;?
 izik1: Yeah, didn't expect the free gold though
 wlesavo: –¥—â–¥
 wlesavo: lol  Cpt. Haddock 0.0
 AntiSquid: lol my garbage bot promoted?
 MSmits: if they choose it at rank 15 and everything below that is about equally you strong, you get a 100 bot legend within a day
 eulerscheZahl: resubmit?
 AntiSquid: so i don't need to submit new version until next week :D
 kovi: wlesavo still silver?
 dbdr: 96 people in gold
 ZarthaxX: dont call it trash squido
 Zenoscave: Why woiuld they resubmit boss?
 AntiSquid: idk i have gold timer frozen at the top
 wlesavo: kovi yeah,  its gonna be a long submit
 Counterbalance: i'm at 200 silver and got promo notice too
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 izik1: 314 people in gold :thinking:
 AntiSquid: is it real or bug?
 Zenoscave: boss has 0.00 score
 YannT: if they resubmited the boss everybody passes ahah
 izik1: Boss seems to have gotten a bad bot
 Beerus: my algo is not even complete and i m gold
 YannT: oh yeah
 kovi: than there may not be real assessment for now
 eulerscheZahl: this does not sound right
 YannT: 267 in gold ahah
 icecream17: What? promotion to gold in 00H 00MN 00 SEC
 ZarthaxX: F
 izik1: F
 Zenoscave: F
 izik1: I expect a revert
 eulerscheZahl: F
 tarriel: I was at the bottom of silver after a bad submission... and am now in gold&#160;:)
 izik1: :v
 AntiSquid: ban
 MSmits: are we all testing our keyboards now?
 eulerscheZahl: did i pay respect?
 icecream17: thank you! i love THIS bug
 YannT: all of silver is gonna go gold now ahah
 ZarthaxX: lol
 izik1: oops
 Zenoscave: Except those who resubmitted...
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/612924-five-years-ago-call-of-duty-press-f-to-pay-respects-meme-born">https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/612924-five-years-ago-call-of-duty-press-f-to-pay-respects-meme-born</a>
 MSmits: They might put everyone back in silver and do it again...
 AntiSquid: no worries probabl getting demoted :D
 Zenoscave: I.e. me, pb4 and wlesavo
 MSmits: ahh ok eulerscheZahl
 Zenoscave: among others
 AntiSquid: i got confirmation message of promotion :thinking:
 pb4: haha
 AntiSquid: anyone out there who didn't get promoted to gold?
 dbdr: 267 in gold :O
 pb4: o/
 Zenoscave: o/
 Astrobytes: wtaf is happening
 wlesavo: :grimacing:
 Zenoscave: Madness
 eulerscheZahl: 463 in gold
 Uljahn: jeez
 MSmits: thats basically what silver was
 pb4: silver will be the new legend
 pb4: 15 people left :D
 izik1: lol
 Zenoscave: pb4 how many matches did you finish
 pb4: I'm at 56
 Zenoscave: I'm at 29
 pb4: but only 5 since league opening
 Astrobytes: Was Silver boss broken or something?
 izik1: 186 gold though, so I'm in the top half
 wlesavo: lol and now boss is back
 wlesavo: :grin:
 izik1: Astrobytes: yeah
 Zenoscave: oops
 AntiSquid: 31 left in silver?
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: too bad if you missed it
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know what happened but i blame Saiksy
 kovi: what will happen now
 dbdr: it's  repetition of the wood 2 situation
 AntiSquid: do we get double the xp&#160;?
 pb4: SaiksyApo now&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&amp;v=2&amp;jpgQuality=100&amp;width=700&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Ffacebook%2F000%2F029%2F405%2Fjordan.jpg">https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&amp;v=2&amp;jpgQuality=100&amp;width=700&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Ffacebook%2F000%2F029%2F405%2Fjordan.jpg</a>
 AntiSquid: i mean i expect to get demoted and repromote later
 Zenoscave: oops
 Zenoscave: ya dun goofed
 eulerscheZahl: you might get depromoted to silver again
 dbdr: AntiSquid I rememer some situation like that and you only got it once
 izik1: If we _don't_ get to keep the XP, I'll get a level down
 pb4: [CG]SaiksyApo
 eulerscheZahl: he's on it
 YannT: can they even do it if they want to :p
 pb4: Just want him to see the image :P
 ZarthaxX: all silver is gold?
 izik1: yep
 izik1: bug
 izik1: bad boss submit
 dbdr: DROP TABLE 'gold';ezpz
 AntiSquid: demote ZarthaxX now [CG]SaiksyApo
 dbdr: CLEAR maybe
 ZarthaxX: i demand to be demoted
 izik1: lol
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: I would rather like to be in Silver now
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr i have a captcha that you will love <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/L1V9ub3">https://imgur.com/a/L1V9ub3</a>
 Zenoscave: nice euler
 MSmits: Illedan you want more social distancing?
 Zenoscave: XKCD
 ZarthaxX: if u get demoted, u can get more xp
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: yeah sw it earlier&#160;:)
 dbdr: saw
 ZarthaxX: i want to be demoted
 wlesavo: 30 ppl silver, nice company
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 YannT: '; DROP TABLE bobby; --
 icecream17: Lol, some people have negative points
 Quidome: WTF is happening???
 eulerscheZahl: once i promoted to bronze twice, only got CP once
 AntiSquid: promotion apocalypse Quidome
 YannT: I'm not on the podium anymore that's what!!
 YannT: preposterous
 wlesavo: boss deleted
 icecream17: 194th. That's the best rank i've ever got. (i'm so tryhard)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm in silver
 izik1: oh, hey
 AntiSquid: lol
 icecream17: wow
 YannT: hey me too!
 Astrobytes: lol
 izik1: they totally reverted the boss
 eulerscheZahl: with a sumbit still running
 Illedan: Maybe I get double XP?!
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: so no gold within the next 2h i guess
 dbdr: empty leaderboard in gold
 icecream17: oh i'm in silver now
 ZarthaxX: silver yay
 Swagboy: Aha back as well
 pb4: So in the end... domak might be first in gold :D
 icecream17: What? It's like I never submitted because I can't add anything other than default
 icecream17: oh nevermind
 Zenoscave: gz domak
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: back to silver \o/
 wlesavo: well at least that was funny
 AntiSquid: i want my old submit date back&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: perfect time to add a sneaky update to your bot without anymore noticing
 YannT: like a 4-ply minmax
 YannT: all sneaky like
 AntiSquid: i thought the most heroic deed would be to hid until 5 minutes before the contest ends?
 icecream17: I win about 4 of the first 10 battles, so hopefully I will get to 5
 BenjaminUrquhart: hold up, how did I get to gold 
 BenjaminUrquhart: what what
 Zenoscave: late to the party BenjaminUrquhart
 YannT: you did, and then you didn't
 YannT: it's shrodinger's gold league
 YannT: you're in it until you look, and then you're not
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have the email to prove it
 Astrobytes: :D
 YannT: but at the end of the journey, you'll find that the gold league was within you all along
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah yes
 kovi:&#160;:)
 codefreak288: nd me
 BenjaminUrquhart: so um, why am I being resubmitted
 codefreak288: wat abt me
 codefreak288: wer
 icecream17: People who silence all the time always beat me. Hey, I realize something. If they silence, I should silence more often
 AntiSquid: sure you can stay wood2 as long you remember the true legend league in your heart ... Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i know it's possible to get a lot of things
 Zenoscave: just not legend in wood
 AntiSquid: you. are. the. legend. Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i start the timer after reading the first input
 AntiSquid: :clap:
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000 is learning!
 Automaton2000: why is it that you are using a ga for csb
 Zenoscave: holy shit
 icecream17: I went alll the way down to 300
 icecream17: So it's accurate now
 AntiSquid: why did everyone submit, should have waited for gold to open first tsk tsk
 BenjaminUrquhart: it auto-submitted when I opened the ide
 SavinVadim: Going live in 10 minutes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/b_lm-GKnqFA">https://youtu.be/b_lm-GKnqFA</a>
 YannT: you donna stream while the leaderboard is in disarray? :o
 reCurse: Good luck submitting anything for the next few hours
 AntiSquid: vadi
 jacek: hmm? no uttt submits?
 AntiSquid: SavinVadim it says live in 24 hours
 SavinVadim: it's live now
 Quidome: Silver looks normal again...
 AntiSquid: with that outfit you should be on twitch ... SavinVadim
 AntiSquid: leaderboard isn't crushing, everyone has their bot rank recalculated
 Quidome: Oh no, I see it now
 AntiSquid: man your assumptions drive me crazy ... why would everyone resubmit at once
 BenjaminUrquhart: they got hte email
 BenjaminUrquhart: they opened ide
 BenjaminUrquhart: instant resubmit
 icecream17: silence 2 instead of silence 0 does wonders
 emh: what happened to Gold?
 eulerscheZahl: it was too big
 eulerscheZahl: like all of silver
 Bob: emh: the boss had a failure and the entire silver lot was promoted
 Bob: so they did a rollback
 emh: oh ok
 Bob: now we have about 5 times the expected number of bots recomputing
 Bob: so we wat :D
 Bob: wait*
 eulerscheZahl: to get a full gold recomp after
 Bob: I just hope I'll make it back up to somewhere above the new boss
 eulerscheZahl: saiksy: set boss score to that of player Xmeanwhile player X: i'll resubmittadaaa, huge gold
 AntiSquid: saiksy at #133, so about 25% promoted
 AntiSquid: will be promoted *
 Bob: initial number of players in gold was 95 before the failure
 pb4: eulerscheZahl :that's what happened&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, paraphrasing here
 wlesavo: euler, but the score was ok for quite a while, but at some point i saw that boss was actually resubmitting at around 30%, after it sited at 0.0 for a while
 eulerscheZahl: the plan was to see how reliably the boss reaches such a rank i think
 wlesavo: oh, i see
 wlesavo: quite reliably
 inoryy: :grimacing:
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: why are your matches that long&#160;?
 kovi: python?
 tempux: :joy:
 _AhmedHafez: how can i go to clash i entered&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: play an old clash again?
 kovi: siman resubmit?
 siman: yes
 kovi: but why?
 _AhmedHafez: see standing of this clash
 kovi: in gold we could have seen some actual standing
 siman: I found new bug and fixed.
 Beerus: guys my programm stops with no timeout or runtime error
 kovi: oh, well im sure i have a lot more as well&#160;:)
 Beerus: at least not a runtime error that codin debuger shows
 Beerus: c++
 _AhmedHafez: how can i find users of my school&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: siman on chat :ohi
 siman: hi, there. but I'm not good at english. :joy:
 jacek: happy Caturday's eve
 kovi:  Those better than the Boss will be promoted to Gold League at 18 H 17 
 kovi: tomorrow or when?
 eulerscheZahl: where do you read that?
 kovi: on leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: F5 and check again
 kovi: still there. what is displayed for you?
 Quidome: Waiting for the bot to to his submit calc
 Quidome: The Boss bot that is
 kovi: 147th
 Quidome: yep, and just recalculated, drum roll
 eulerscheZahl: oh, it's back
 eulerscheZahl: my IDE leaderboard was all white
 tobk: what happened with gold promotion?
 eulerscheZahl: scroll to the boss at #107
 Bob: there was a bug
 eulerscheZahl: boss needs 100% too
 tobk: some were already in gold, now all in silver again; i got promotion message, but now am well below the boss&#160;:-(
 Bob: all of silver got accidentally promoted to gol
 Bob: they had to rollback, rerun silver and restart the boss
 Quidome: Cpt. Haddock now at 107
 Quidome: I am below the cut this way&#160;:(
 wlesavo: is it time for resubmit?
 Quidome: no, no, no
 Quidome: mayhem
 wlesavo: jk
 Bob: the original cut at 18:17 was at #95, just saying
 lNitsua: I'm trying a new path finding that does a BFS to find available paths, and ranks them based on how open they leave the map, and how much information they give away
 eulerscheZahl: you can submit wlesavo
 Bob: now it looks like they're adjusting the strength of the boss to get a similar cut
 eulerscheZahl: boss will take some time
 lNitsua: but, how should I score those things?
 eulerscheZahl: i think bosses get more battles than regular players
 lNitsua: and how would I score the whole path? If I take the sum of the whole path, the longest will just win, and if I take the highest score the shortest path will win because of fewer moves
 lNitsua: would the average be best?
 Quidome: Just don't submit and wait a while...
 tobk: funny how it still says "gold promotion at 18 H 17"
 Bob: that's probably the time of the original promotion
 Bob: but yeah&#160;:)
 tobk: of course, it does not say which day...
 Quidome: :D
 eulerscheZahl: SaiksyApo posting this on discord: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/690566608891936769/695691013309857852/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/690566608891936769/695691013309857852/unknown.png</a>
 Bob: lNitsua I'd say just check how much space you have left at the end and size of your own visibility map
 Bob: don't go for complicated stuff, just use one criterion for main decision and the second one as a tie-breaker
 Bob: my current code does excatly that
 eulerscheZahl: the lazy bob
 Bob: #whatElse
 lNitsua: does it matter that since I can't check all possible paths, some will be shorter?
 Bob: nope
 emh: ah Cpt Haddock is calculating I see
 lNitsua: the shorter ones will technically have more room and give away less information, but with a BFS they'll only be off by like one or two
 ZarthaxX: classic bobby
 Bob: in most cases the game is not decided on who runs out of space first
 Quidome: Yes didn't know what was happening at first and was happy to be in gold and now I don't make the cut...
 Bob: just make sure you avoid trapping yourself in obvious short dead-ends 
 eulerscheZahl: the other guys just keep shooting at me&#160;:/
 Bob: because *then* the resulting surface both docks you one HP and reveals you
 eulerscheZahl: only the sector
 Bob: yes but depending on the configuration it can be a lot
 ZarthaxX: promotion
 eulerscheZahl: boss at 80
 Bob: wooo I'm just above
 kovi: wow lucky boss
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445075002">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445075002</a> I am clearly missing something
 eulerscheZahl: i think that score was set manually
 wlesavo: 3/10
 wlesavo: lol
 Bob: considering I was 54th at the original promotion, I'd have been rather vexed not to make it this time around
 Quidome: Cpt Haddock is now at 81 and you are at 77 Bob&#160;:)
 Bob: \o/
 dbdr: whom did you play wlesavo? :D
 Bob: let's be bottom of gold now
 eulerscheZahl: the toadand he won&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i'm one of his 3 wins
 dbdr: but he lost 7??
 dbdr: no, won 9
 Quidome: OK gold is back in business
 jacek: why theres no easter toad?
 wlesavo: no i meant 3/10 in rank, one loss
 dbdr: ah&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: because i'm not religious jacek
 eulerscheZahl: hm, that doesn't add up with xmas...
 dbdr: xmas recycled pre-christian celebrations
 eulerscheZahl: based on another religion?
 Zenoscave: mostly pagan
 dbdr: not even sure it was religions
 dbdr: it's the darkest time of the year, makes sense to do something at that time
 eulerscheZahl: ZarthaxX will disagree
 Zenoscave: ZarthaxX do you disagree?
 ZarthaxX: yes i disagree
 ZarthaxX: what are we talking about btw?
 Zenoscave: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: xmas = darkest time of the year
 ZarthaxX: not my case :P
 dbdr: ocean of code = bluest time of the year
 Zenoscave: I see mostly red and yellow dbdr :P
 dbdr: initial map&#160;;)
 emh: wow I'm a bottom feeder now in Gold
 Zenoscave: how many in gold now?
 Zenoscave: ~100
 eulerscheZahl: 81
 Zenoscave:&#160;?
 Zenoscave: ok
 eulerscheZahl: and emh won't make it to legend with the current bot
 eulerscheZahl: neither will i :fearful:
 emh: I guess it's true
 dbdr: depends how the boss behaves&#160;;)
 emh: will have to gather my wits and C++
 Zenoscave: ... Why do you say that euler? new strat?
 YannT: pretty sure you will eulerscheZahl
 YannT: legend bar is usually not thaaat high!
 eulerscheZahl: still 1 week to go, others will improve
 dbdr: with current boss he means
 Zenoscave: oh
 dbdr: *current bot
 eulerscheZahl: i'm confident that i'm able to reach legend
 YannT: yeah that's what I mean too
 eulerscheZahl: just needs some more work
 YannT: current top5-10 bots feel good enough to reach legend in a week
 YannT: improvements become less dramatic as the contest drag on
 eulerscheZahl: true
 eulerscheZahl: i still want to work on my mine avoidance
 eulerscheZahl: and stealth
 Zenoscave: Mine avoidance important now?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 Zenoscave: I'm still ignoring them
 eulerscheZahl: i even surface and turn around sometimes
 YannT: remember locam, bots basically stagnated by the end
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: someone called?
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: :D
 Zenoscave: lol
 eulerscheZahl: locam was a horrible game for such a long contest
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic:&#160;;(
 eulerscheZahl: not complaining about the game itself, just the combo of game + marathon
 Zenoscave: BotG best game
 YannT: by the last week everyone pretty much already had the best bot they could muster anyway
 eulerscheZahl: which wasn't even aCat's idea as he told me in all caps
 dbdr: it was good if you took it slowy
 dbdr: slowly
 dbdr: it was august after all
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: yeah, that was CG 'testing'&#160;;]
 AntiSquid: banning LegendsOfCodeAndMagic @_@
 YannT: it was a solvable game essentially... so once you've solved it there's not much to do :p
 AntiSquid: wrong contest
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: xD
 Zenoscave: who is LoCaM Really
 AntiSquid: cat guy
 Zenoscave: uljahn?
 eulerscheZahl: LegendsOfCodeAndMagic = aCat?
 AntiSquid: acat 
 AntiSquid: where's my money? 
 Astrobytes: Was the account he used on stream during LoCaM iirc?
 Zenoscave: still no money AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: no lol
 Zenoscave: tsk tsk LegendsOfCodeAndMagic
 eulerscheZahl: but he announced the next contest already
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 rough him up
 Automaton2000: you have to submit a bot to play the game
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: hell do I know
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: with the same game and previous winner codes public
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: sent some mails
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: 'investigating'
 AntiSquid: is it ok to submit #1 bot from previous contest into your new contest? i mean i don't get prizes anyway
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i'm still waiting for my Arduino Emoro Pro robot kit from riddles.io&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: i doubt you will ever get that eulerscheZahl considering the state of riddles.io
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 eulerscheZahl: and booking.com told me they sent it
 Zenoscave: in need
 AntiSquid: maybe it would be different if the guy from riddles.io was here in chat
 AntiSquid: would it?
 Zenoscave: Anti are you that guy?
 stone43: How long has riddles.io been reinventing their site?
 eulerscheZahl: not even riddles' faultthey shared contact information with the sponsors
 eulerscheZahl: stone is back :o
 AntiSquid: sure Zenoscave, i am using his arduino for a pass the butter bot
 stone43: yes, I was away for a while
 Zenoscave: what is its purpose?
 AntiSquid: to pass the butter
 Zenoscave: oh god
 eulerscheZahl: riddles certificated was created in july 2019, expired in october
 eulerscheZahl: so it got inactive somewhere in between
 IAmTheTurtle: hi everyone. I got a message that i have been promoted to gold... well, i haven't and I guess I shouldn't (currently low in rank in silver). Is it a bug? 
 Zenoscave: yes. IAmTheTurtle
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: you are in silver until you beat the boss
 ZarthaxX: IAmTheTurtle are u from halite?
 IAmTheTurtle: thanks&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: or intentional&#160;! :o
 AntiSquid: promote all so it generates an email and have them check the game again
 eulerscheZahl: you get an email for promotion?
 Zenoscave: Why wouldn't they just send an email
 IAmTheTurtle: halite?
 AntiSquid: i do euler
 IAmTheTurtle: @euler: i did
 eulerscheZahl: hm, maybe i deactivated the notification
 ZarthaxX: nvm im
 kingofnumbers: There's a bug in the boss of silver 
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX that is a "all your something something " 
 Zenoscave: probably . you hate notifications
 ZarthaxX: nvm IAmTheTurtle
 kingofnumbers: outputs: 
 kingofnumbers: SILENCE N 0 | MOVE S SILENCE |  | MSG 10 4 or 1
 kingofnumbers: then: 
 kingofnumbers: Game Summary:Not enough charges of SILENCE
 kovi: lucky rolls
 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: anyone playing codejam tomorrow?
 Zenoscave: o/
 AntiSquid: no
 Counterbalance: something went wrong earlier with the promotions so they reset it and did it again
 Counterbalance: ohh scroll bug 
 Zandy156: kingofnumbers it doesn't affect anything though does it?
 wlesavo: euler thx, registered just now, never tried such things though, but at least will look into problems
 eulerscheZahl: in the qualification round you have 24h
 eulerscheZahl: and only need to solve about 2 out of 4 problems to reach round 1
 eulerscheZahl: "We'll bring the top 25 contestants from Code Jam Online Round 3 to our onsite World Finals, where they'll compete for the championship title and a cash prize of $15,000."
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how realistic that announcement is
 icecream17: Wait, I can register? But it says "I am at least 16 years old" and...
 stone43: How far do you get Euler?
 stone43: *did
 AntiSquid: haha very eager
 eulerscheZahl: last year i qualified for round 3 (but had no time on that day)
 Adnane.a.a: sup
 AntiSquid: i would have called in sick at work, i mean screw it :p
 stone43: 15k pay day would be worth one day of PTO
 stone43: or fake being sick
 eulerscheZahl: $10k for the winner
 eulerscheZahl: 15k for all finalists together
 eulerscheZahl: and we all know who will get that 10k
 wlesavo: onsite means offline?
 eulerscheZahl: in the google office
 JBM: which one this year?
 wlesavo: i see, not very realistic indeed
 eulerscheZahl: the one without Corona
 miles7: hahaha
 JBM: unannounced?
 eulerscheZahl: can't find it despite searching for it
 AntiSquid: idk still free trip right euler? why no day off? 
 eulerscheZahl: yes, google pays travelling expenses
 JBM: that contest is going down the drain
 JBM: no wait, wrong idiom
 JBM: is "on hte wrong path"
 kovi: who: let me guess, start with t?
 Zenoscave: is there someone who always wins?
 chucknorris: yes
 JBM: that's not his nick on GCJ
 JBM: but yeah
 eulerscheZahl: 6 wins in a rowwasn't allowed to participate in the finals before, as he wasn't 18 years old
 Zenoscave: whoa
 kovi: wow, chucknorris?&#160;:)
 NinjaDoggy: wew i'm late for ocean of code&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: no notification till yesterday?&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: Ninja Gold is open
 Zenoscave: better catch up!
 NinjaDoggy: yea... gonna play catch up :P
 eulerscheZahl: still 16 days to go
 NinjaDoggy: yea still plenty of time
 eulerscheZahl: there was a email notification the day the contest started
 NinjaDoggy: i somehow missed it i guess&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that can happen easilysome other players also found the contest by coincidence
 kovi: hmm, solid lead
 eulerscheZahl: and the next thing is already announced <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/CodinGame/status/1246110607419547648">https://twitter.com/CodinGame/status/1246110607419547648</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know any details
 darkhorse64: a pacman bot&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, pacman gets 40 years old
 AntiSquid: damn this was a waste of time Q_Q
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIrvpn3k9A4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIrvpn3k9A4</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, Remi is the best
 eulerscheZahl: he stopped before he became boring
 Astrobytes: Yep. If only someone would tell all the other 'funny' people on youtube
 AntiSquid: i stopped halfway through the video
 MSmits: You can't even do this in the US. Instead of a golf club you get shot by Ak47 :P
 inoryy: Code Jam finals were planned for late summer so quite realistic they'll happen
 AntiSquid: more likely to be tasered MSmits
 MSmits: think tasers are more rare than assault rifles :P
 AntiSquid: or pepper sprayed
 MSmits: yeah thats more likely
 eulerscheZahl: when you keep flattening the curve, we have to continue social distancing for about a year, given the available beds in hospital in germany
 MSmits: the spread may slow down as more people develop immunity. That means you can have more contact between people while having the same hospitalization rate
 MSmits: also hospital capacity may increase
 AntiSquid: i heard in US you get massive hospital bills sent to your home address :D
 MSmits: yeah, uninsured people will, of which there are quite a few
 MSmits: 30k or so if you're in for a week
 emh: ok I registered for codejam. never tried it before. not sure how much time I will invest
 AntiSquid: so maybe a lot of people don't want to test for COVID because they can't afford it in US
 eulerscheZahl: the qualification round is fairly easyif you only go for the points needed to advance and you know a bit of coding, you are done in 15-20min
 AntiSquid: which is why some people have weird ideas like china spreading it intentionally to screw over the US
 MSmits: yeah, great idea. let's screw over our own country and then the US!
 AntiSquid: RAIC level of targeting 
 MSmits: as opposed to just hopping on a plane straight away :P
 AntiSquid: ok my NN is ready!!!
 AntiSquid: but it only outputs MOVE N TORPEDO&#160;:/
 MSmits: you have an actual NN?
 AntiSquid: yes, massive time waste, since i must have fucked up something really badly
 struct: Do you have NN experience?
 AntiSquid: most likely the backpropagation
 AntiSquid: attempted imitation learning
 Nagatwin: FC NN&#160;?
 AntiSquid: what sort of experience are you implying struct?
 Nagatwin: Tried to do a NN approach on oware
 Nagatwin: but failed kinda hard
 struct: If you ever done this successfully 
 eulerscheZahl: did csipcsirip change his nick?
 struct: I think he is chucknorris
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i think toobut why?
 AntiSquid: yes but ocean of code is clearly difficult struct
 eulerscheZahl: i finally learned how to spell it&#160;:(
 Nagatwin: hahaaaa
 AntiSquid: does the character exploit still work on the IDE? the weights occupy a lot of space
 inoryy: character exploit?
 AntiSquid: certain chars weren't counted into the total i think
 Zenoscave: no unicode chars are two bytes but only one char
 MSmits: meaning you can fit more information. It's not an exploit
 inoryy: not really an exploit though
 Zenoscave: yeah agreed
 AntiSquid: but does it help with storing long decimals?
 pb4: probably falls under the obfuscation rule
 Zenoscave: 4 chars of bin packed
 Zenoscave: and pb4 has a point
 Zenoscave: Man Gold got hard fast
 eulerscheZahl: legend is where the struggle begins
 NinjaDoggy: you mean last day of contest gold
 NinjaDoggy: is where the true struggle is
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Zenoscave: legend is my goal. just getting legend is enough for me
 NinjaDoggy: pass gold = automatic top 20 legend&#160;:/
 MSmits: yeah thats what happened to me last time
 MSmits: well before utg that is
 NinjaDoggy: happened to me as well i think
 MSmits: on ice and fire
 NinjaDoggy: at least twice?
 eulerscheZahl: my UTG story too
 Counterbalance: is it posible that on some CG servers the code gets compiled to 32 bit?
 Zenoscave: I doubt it
 Zenoscave: but possible I suppose
 eulerscheZahl: highly unlikely i would say
 Counterbalance: yes, thought so
 struct: at least for multies is no
 Counterbalance: got some stackoverflow errors before main() at win32..
 eulerscheZahl: CG has linux servers
 struct: ^
 Counterbalance: I know
 eulerscheZahl: and they won't use both 32bit and 64bit compilers, as it's creating more effort in maintenance
 struct: What is the error message counter?
 Counterbalance: timeout
 struct: no error from compiler'
 Counterbalance: nope
 Counterbalance: I'll look into it further - must be something silly
 struct: What if you remove pragmas?
 Counterbalance: it's intermittent - if i replay it often works fine
 YannT: private enum class Damage { TWO, MAYBE_TWO, ONE }
 YannT: I think I'm on the right track here
 YannT: :nerd:
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 YannT: an integer isn't enoufg to express damage, you need an enum
 eulerscheZahl: a double
 YannT: and I'll add MAYBE_ONE in the next feature rollout
 Zandy156: I really didn't think I'd be able to get into gold with movement that isn't based on the opponents actions.
 MSmits: my bot moves randomly as well
 MSmits: I just do a depth 0 floodfill to see if i dont lock myself in
 Zandy156: I mean I get destroyed by mines, but they aren't that common yet I guess.
 MSmits: mines are very common...
 NinjaDoggy: this game is so sick
 NinjaDoggy: too bad i'll have to swap to C++ later for more computattions
 YannT: it's honestly not critical as of yet
 NinjaDoggy: yea for now it doesn't matter
 YannT: one of the top bots is python :p 
 NinjaDoggy: but in a few days it's gonna matter a lot
 YannT: it doesn't feel like this is going to be an optimization centric contest
 NinjaDoggy: why not?
 NinjaDoggy: you can track the opponent quite well if yout wanted
 YannT: yes but it doesn't take that much time
 NinjaDoggy: but there's a lot you can do
 NinjaDoggy: after you track them
 MSmits: unless they spam silence&#160;:)
 MSmits: then it takes a lot
 NinjaDoggy:  yep and that too
 MSmits: btw, you can solve it by just exploding a few mines
 NinjaDoggy: hm... maybe i should just do some stuff and get to bronze first
 MSmits: I dont really see the benefit of sonar tbh, mines also clear the fog and they can actually do damage
 NinjaDoggy: before i work on tracking and stuff lol
 YannT: or just reset paths because there's literally no upside to tracking 1k paths anyway
 MSmits: what do you mean there is no upside?
 YannT: at that point it doesn't really prune anything anymore&#160;:)
 MSmits: if you track the path, you have more cells he can't have moved to
 Nagatwin: and info on the mines placements
 MSmits: even if he lays no mines
 YannT: unless you have every possible cell in the paths, then it does prune paths but not positions anyway (which is the end result you want)
 MSmits: it does prune positions
 NinjaDoggy: also if you track paths you can get better reads on positions
 MSmits: if you know the path, then you know he can't move to any of the spaces on the path
 NinjaDoggy: ilke if 10 paths lead to a certain position
 MSmits: so you eliminate those positions
 NinjaDoggy: and if only 2 paths go to some other position
 YannT: okay but lets assume you have one path,  right, then chain silence from that, you're going to have a few positions and a gazillion paths that cover all possibilities, so the paths won't prune positions anymore, might as well act like he surface and reset them
 Counterbalance: 101250 paths max
 MSmits: it's not black and white
 MSmits: you should track all paths as much as you can, there's a good chance you can make it
 MSmits: and if not, prune smartly
 MSmits: dont just prune all paths
 MSmits: prune partial paths
 YannT: I'm not saying don't track paths in general, I'm saying at the certain point it becomes useless anyway (and that point requires the opponent to do nothing but silence which doesn't win)
 MSmits: like, keep *some* visited cells as blocked, because they appear in all paths leading to a destination
 YannT: this loops back to: performance is not that big a thing right now
 MSmits: again... it's not black and white, it's not 100% useful or 100% useless. The more you track the better it is
 MSmits: more paths stored does help
 MSmits: even with a chain silencer
 YannT: as a physics teacher you should really get more comfortable approximating stuff :p
 MSmits: say there is a tight corridor he has to have passed in all 100k paths you have storeed
 YannT: that's like, the entire difference between physics and maths
 YannT: being able to say "this is annoying and also negligible" :p
 MSmits: yes but I think it's not negligible
 NinjaDoggy: nothing's negligible when pushing for top 5 :P
 YannT: like friction in physics, it's always a thing until it's not because it got annoying to deal with
 MSmits: also think about this Yannt, say he has 100 possible positions
 MSmits: some of those possible positions have thousands of paths leading to them
 MSmits: but some have maybe 3
 MSmits: and the 3 paths share a lot of common characteristics
 NinjaDoggy: ^ my point earlier
 YannT: MSmits: my entire point is that literally never happens in a proper game
 MSmits: if you just clean the whole history... you're definitely losing out
 chucknorris: adn if u want to go deeper than 1ply I think knowing where the enemy can step is a must
 MSmits: YannT if you mean that you never run out of memory and calculation time, then you're right, chain silencers dont exist at the top
 MSmits: mines will make sure you can simply track all
 YannT: typically against a chain silencing bot you'll have like maybe 30 positions for 1k paths, and at that point keeping those paths is useless because 1) it doesn't prune anymore and 2) you're against a bot who does nothing but silence and you've put mines everywhere so you're gonna win
 MSmits: unless he knows where you put em&#160;:)
 chucknorris: btw its usually max n points and 5n paths 
 YannT: well I've yet to see a silence spam bot perform well&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: Saelyos
 MSmits: but sure, there is a good possibility it wont benefit you much to do minimal pruning, but while prune too much if you dont have to
 MSmits: I literally have a 20 line function and some hashing to do minimal pruning when i have to
 Nagatwin: Anyone has some advice about memory managment for the paths&#160;?
 MSmits: why prune too much i mean
 YannT: of course if you can handle a gazillions paths then feel free too of course, my entire point is it's not critical for success (looping back to: performance doesn't really mattter yet)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: then you're right
 Nagatwin: Atm I have a vector&lt;path_struct *&gt;, using new to duplicate paths and delete when these are not relevant anymore
 Counterbalance: Nagatwin i just store all paths and some grids per path; my struct size is around 70MB
 Nagatwin: CounterBalance using an array&#160;? a vector&lt;struct&gt;&#160;?
 Counterbalance: each path is   unsigned char positions[MAX_TURNS]
 Counterbalance: I chose not to use STL here because of performance.. malloc/free is very slow
 YannT: MSmits: you know what was a good idea tho, your plan for tracking mines
 JBM: Illedan, Illedan, Illedan
 YannT: I implemented it and kudos to you, it works wonders
 Nagatwin: Counterbalance&#160;: I need to store more than an array of chars per path
 JBM: that message was not a questoin to you! O:-)
 YannT: my paths are int[15]
 MSmits: YannT cool, good to know
 Nagatwin: Counterbalance I feel like moving my structs around the array when I delete one is more costly than having to free/new
 YannT: and, thatt also fits mines quite conveniently&#160;:)
 MSmits: do you do this in 32 bit now?
 MSmits: I switched to 64 bit myself
 YannT: yes
 Nagatwin: Msmits I guess I figured out the way you work with mines
 Counterbalance: a copy of a struct is far faster than free/malloc Nagatwin.. I do a compact iteration after the updates 
 YannT: int[15) = 32 bits per row, 15 for path, 15 for mines
 YannT: fits perfect
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1b6ad14b-7f91-4bf2-899d-9084dd0ad609">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1b6ad14b-7f91-4bf2-899d-9084dd0ad609</a>
 YannT: and the idea to put mines in there was yours&#160;:)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: yeah thats what i do Nagatwin
 MSmits: I changed mine to 64 bit for now
 Nagatwin: Oh does it matters&#160;?
 MSmits: i had some bugs before and i wanted to eliminate the possibility of overflow
 Nagatwin: I had a 64 too
 MSmits: the thing is, in practice it never happens that a place is visited 4 times
 Nagatwin: didn't you have a hp map or something&#160;?
 MSmits: so a mine will never be laid from it 4 times
 MSmits: but what if i prune visited cells
 MSmits: then they can be visited again
 MSmits: and i might get overflow in my sim
 Nagatwin: Counterbalance I'm curious, how do you know that&#160;?
 MSmits: Nagatwin i have a damage map but its not in my state
 Nagatwin: MSmits oh ok alright
 MSmits: i pass it down through my order processing and at the end of processing i use it to filter the state
 MSmits: it goes down a recursive function
 Nagatwin: Yeah
 YannT: I had a damage map, ended up getting rid of it
 Nagatwin: filtering through state hp too
 Counterbalance: Oh for one thing, flat arrays are many times faster than stl vector, and I've read and written several malloc libraries. They use linked lists, region splitting/merging etc.. a lot of overhead
 YannT: it was faster to just scan ceels
 YannT: cells*
 Valdemar: MSmits you do not need visited cells after surface and so onfor mines it's reasonable though
 MSmits: no after the surface, you reset visited cells
 MSmits: but its still part of the state
 MSmits: because you got 1 visited cell already
 YannT: if you keep mies on say the high 15 bits of an int, path on the lower 15 bits, you can reset paths within resetting mines&#160;:)
 YannT: assuming a 32 bits int
 MSmits: yeah you can do that. I do think you still do it differently though Yannt
 MSmits: you track mines directly
 MSmits: I track places from which mines were laid
 YannT: yes, per path, it's linked
 Valdemar: MSmits of coursedo you guys try to minimize amount of memory?
 YannT: prune a path, prune the mines that go with it
 YannT: it's perfect&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: Nagatwin if I remove a path, I copy the last path in there and reduce the size of the array; I don't have to copy the entire array if I remove the first entry, like vector&lt;&gt; does
 MSmits: dont think memory is a problem valdemar, but minimizing memory maximizes speed also
 YannT: MSmits: I keep track of places the mines were laid too
 MSmits: but if you only have 15 bit, how do you track multiple mines being laid from the same cell?
 YannT: not the mines themselves (you don't know where they are, it's a 1 in N chance)
 YannT: it's true I don't
 MSmits: is this a problem?
 YannT: someone could surface, go back, lay another at the same place and it wouldn't increase my odds when it should
 MSmits: hmm ok
 YannT: not really because the possibility of a mine being laid from there still exists anyway
 YannT: it should be higher, granted
 YannT: but in the end you wanna avoid mines anyway :p
 MSmits: yes, but you dont just use it to avoid them
 MSmits: you also use it to track the opponent
 MSmits: when he explodes one
 YannT: true,  I could remove a path unduly because of that
 MSmits: that was my worry. But it is probably extremely rare
 YannT: if he explodes both and I consider it not possible
 MSmits: like our earlier discussion
 YannT: never saw it happen yeah&#160;:)
 MSmits: I actually have a if statement that kills my bot if i have no possible position left
 MSmits: never happens anymore
 domenico.lordi: hey everyone
 Nagatwin: Counterbalance yeah that's what I thought about
 MSmits: Nagatwin you were right the other day btw
 MSmits: you said my method leaves out one rare bit of possible information
 Nagatwin: but my vector is a vector of pointers so it should not be too expensive
 MSmits: i thought about it some more
 domenico.lordi: any python coder?
 MSmits: if an opponent lays a mine somewhere and in your sim, he lays a mine at the same position during a time before it has exploded (two mines in same spot), then that is actually an impossible state
 Nagatwin: MSmits actually I said that because I did not though that you were having 1 position per path but a list of possible ending position for each path
 MSmits: my method doesnt respect the order in which mines were laid, just the position from where they were laid
 MSmits: so a mine might explode, get removed  and another mine laid in that place
 MSmits: that has to be checked for timing, for perfect tracking
 Nagatwin: Oh I see
 YannT: well, I abide by the YAGNI concept
 MSmits: I can do it actually, but I need another 16 bit map to fix that
 YannT: until it screws me over, it's not an issue :p
 MSmits: not sure if i will
 Valdemar: update tracker during processing enemy actions should be sufficient
 Nagatwin: MSmits does the order matters&#160;?
 MSmits: on the real path, two mines never get laid in the same place before 1 has exploded
 MSmits: but one of your tracked states might do this
 Nagatwin: Oh yes
 MSmits: you could have eliminated this 
 YannT: unless there's a surface in the  path
 MSmits: if you checked the timing
 MSmits: YannT yes
 Nagatwin: Not only the timing but also the amount of nearby available cells
 MSmits: yes, well that should be counted. I am already tracking that I think
 Nagatwin: I handle this when I generate a mine map but not during the state update, I felt like it was unnecessary
 MSmits: these are super rare issues, I doubt it's worth anyone's time
 MSmits: I just wanted to let you know you were not wrong when you said you felt like my method is missing some bit of info
 YannT: I don't think checking for "double laying of mines" would prune a lot because you have a verry little chance to have two line laying positions where there's no option for for them both to be in the same place
 Nagatwin: Yeah :D
 Valdemar: is sounds like spending much time to optimise 0.01% cases
 MSmits: it wouldnt prune anything probably YannT
 MSmits: it's a perfectionist issue
 YannT:&#160;;)
 YannT: you know what is an issue tho, my eval not taking a guaranteed 2 dmg torpedo because it considers that would give my position away too much
 YannT: I really need to rewrite it...
 MSmits: you mean it would need to get 1 cell closer?
 YannT: no no
 YannT: it can shoot
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 NinjaDoggy: "wortH'
 YannT: chooses not to
 MSmits: thats bad yeah
 MSmits: my bot just fires when it can 
 YannT: because the tradeof in detection isn't worth it according to it :p
 MSmits: well above a threshold
 MSmits: it's still blasterpoards 0.7 
 JBM: you've been talking about that rewrite all day
 YannT: well in my defense I was #1 for a while I wasn't gonna screw with that
 MSmits: my current bot doesnt care if anyone sees it. Minespam ftw
 Valdemar: YannT you use some kind of search with all actions to certain depth?
 JBM: sure you were
 JBM: we're 3 weeks from contest end
 MSmits: 2 now
 YannT: for now it's basically 1-ply bruteforce
 JBM: oh yeah
 MSmits: i'm not in a hurry
 JBM: I was counting with 6-day weeks /o\
 MSmits: trying to make my uttt solver use ab pruning with draws :P
 Valdemar: including enemy moves or just yours? YannT
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 NinjaDoggy: i tried that for a bit
 YannT: no 1-ply
 NinjaDoggy: never really got it to work&#160;:/
 NinjaDoggy: or it just gave no performance improvements&#160;:(
 YannT: next rewrite eval, then 2-ply&#160;:)
 MSmits: you mean the solver?
 NinjaDoggy: yea
 NinjaDoggy: ab pruning with draws
 MSmits: it works well on some games. On uttt small improvement, not easy to notice
 Illedan: Hi
 MSmits: oh the ab pruning specifically
 MSmits: i have no idea, it doesnt work yet
 Valdemar: So you get to the top6 with only that? Impressive
 YannT: ab pruning on minmax is typically a drastic improvement on most games
 MSmits: no this is mcts solver YannT
 MSmits: not minimax
 Illedan: minmax on ooc?
 MSmits: no lol... uttt :P
 YannT: yeah I think that would be good Illedan actually
 YannT: that's my plan
 Illedan: Sure, play vs all possible locations and paths :D
 YannT: especially when ennemy uncertainty is low, seems very appropriate
 MSmits: beamsearch might be better
 karliso: How do you do minimax in this game?
 JBM: sam as any other
 MSmits: dont think you do karliso
 Illedan: Sure you can
 YannT: beamsearch is hard to implement here I think when you think about it
 Illedan: But you need assumptions
 MSmits: well there are so many ways to do searches in ooc, we may be talking about different things
 YannT: you're gonna end up with 10 order combinations with same of similar scoring, it's gonna be like SILENCE 1 N, SILENCE 2 N, etc
 MSmits: I was more talking about a search as in Hypersonic. Navigating an existing possible minefield using beamsearch, ignoring opponent
 YannT: so it'll be hard to take the "N better options"
 Illedan: Branching factor is not too high in this either
 MSmits: not if you know where he is, no
 YannT: I think you really need minmax to show you that the difference between  moving here or one tile over is a torpedo in the face
 YannT: 1-ply will tell you these are equal or  close, opponent turn will show you it's really not
 YannT: at least that's my thought
 ronlobo: Anybody using any reinforcement learning or genetic algorithms for this?
 Illedan: Think the most advanced bots are  react bots with some pathing searching and complex ifs
 MSmits: thats what i was planning to code
 Illedan: I'm working on my search :P
 YannT: at that point I think all bots are 1-ply bruteforce of order combinations with some description of eval
 Illedan: My if spagetti is just making me sad
 YannT: you can see it in the "surface killshots"
 Beerus: how can i get the inputs from debug error stream
 YannT: crazy finishers like SURFACE|MOVE N|SURFACE N 4|TORPEDO DEAD
 JBM: too many surface
 YannT: happens if you combine all orders and see what happens 
 YannT: SILENCE* :p
 Valdemar: YannT yeah, they looks really fun
 karliso: So this game is more strategic than search based...
 Illedan: At the moment
 YannT: for now yes
 MSmits: karliso, provided you write a good tracker first
 Valdemar: I planned to realise that even further with mine placement and instant trigger, but rules don't allow that:unamused:
 MSmits: you need this or your strategy wont help you
 YannT: performance or algos are not much of a thing at this point
 Illedan: You need to search for the opponent though..
 YannT: opponent tracking is all heuristic yeah&#160;:)
 Beerus: how do i copy paste the console
 Valdemar: Beerus you can copy paste by hands, or try automate it with post request to codingame server
 Valdemar: there is post from magus describing more, but you still will need research. There is no ready to use solutions
 Valdemar: post on forum I mean
 Beerus: i will try by hands
 JBM: hey Illedan/eZ if any of you still around, I was wondering if I got it clear
 JBM: is win/loss ocndition checked per action or per turn?
 Illedan: hm?
 Illedan: ye
 YannT: it's per action
 JBM: k thx
 YannT: you win on the frame someone goes to 0
 Overacter: afte4r surfacing the x and y coordiante change is that normal?
 JBM: even if you suicide like worse later in same turn
 Illedan: ye
 YannT: yes
 JBM: thanks
 Illedan: should be the same Overacter, unless you move too..
 Overacter: after surfacing i move in x driection but the y ccoridnate changed instead of x
 Overacter: befor surfacing all ccordiante where right
 Illedan: Replay?
 Overacter: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445144836">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445144836</a>
 Illedan: You not at 0 14 after the surface?
 Overacter: yes but i moved and the position keeped the same
 Overacter: that messed up my position tracking
 Illedan: You sure you don't overwrite some position or something during Surface?
 Illedan: Do you forget to clear the path in your code?
 Overacter: $x and $y come in every loop
 ZarthaxX: reading x y wrong from input? :P
 Overacter: fscanf(STDIN, "%d %d %d %d %d %d %d %d", $x, $y, $myLife, $oppLife, $torpedoCooldown, $sonarCooldown, $silenceCooldown, $mineCooldown);
 Illedan: Maybe you print 2 lines when doing surface?
 Overacter: no and i never set $x and $y
 Overacter: i allways keep the input
 Overacter: i can track my position myself but that not should not be needed
 Overacter: a replay with only output after reading input <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445150119">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445150119</a>
 Overacter: have fun
 Valdemar: only you can see your debug output
 Valdemar: so there is nothing interesting in this replay at all :grinning:
 Valdemar: try use MSG for that
 JFB: Strange - I received message "Better than the boss in Ocean of code" - you will be promoted to Gold league soon - it was abot 5 h ago - but I'm in silver still. It was wrong message? 
 Counterbalance: they botched it and put everyone back in silver and tried again
 icecream17: you missed the whole thing
 Valdemar: inside IDE on each turn you see debug output for the next command you don't printed yet. It may be confused at first Overacter
 JFB: OK -&#160;:-)
 DEIZ21: hey illedan, Bravo for the ranking.
 Illedan: ty
 DEIZ21: ll u share your code when the contest finish? i would be interrest
 DEIZ21: to learn
 DEIZ21: if not i can understant&#160;;)
 JBM: IMHO it'd be easier to understand if he did share it
 DEIZ21: hhh i meant i can understand his decision
 JBM: xd
 Astrobytes: lolDEIZ21 the contest will come back as a multiplayer game after the contest ends, so code sharing is generally frowned upon
 Valdemar: on my view postmortem is far more useful, you can understand little from cryptic contest code everybody written there
 Astrobytes: Valdemar yep
 JBM: not all PMs are created equal
 DEIZ21: it's my first time i code an ia
 JBM: nice
 DEIZ21: i need much ressources
 DEIZ21: and time
 Valdemar: welcome to the club then
 Astrobytes: You got 16 days DEIZ21&#160;:)
 DEIZ21: no
 DEIZ21: i do work, i have a wife and children..
 DEIZ21: :D
 JBM: they can survive
 Astrobytes: I mean, the competition has 16 more days, so use your spare time wisely&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: and leave your family
 DEIZ21: yes i have some ideas but i dont think they ll enhance my bot that much
 Astrobytes: Yes. CG self-isolation
 YannT: using spare time wisely probably shouldn't consist in playing submarine :p
 Beerus: i am trying minimax too
 DEIZ21: YannT hhh
 Astrobytes: lol, depends I guess YannT :D
 Valdemar: totally right, is should consist of writing AI to play submarine
 DEIZ21: minimax?? how the hell is this possible
 YannT: very possible imo, that's my plan for the future
 Beerus: branching factor is huge, u need to expand the "best" actions
 muy31: ok, am i in gold league or silver?
 DEIZ21: possible but you need to evaluate the board and precomputed position evaluation
 Astrobytes: If you are tracking your opponent well DEIZ21 then you can minimax 
 DEIZ21: it's not a complete information game..
 muy31: it is a good enough info game
 DEIZ21: sorry, i dont think so
 Astrobytes: That's why tracking your opponent is important
 muy31: ive been using minimax since wood 2
 muy31: to movce
 muy31: move
 DEIZ21: what league now?
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: how deep minimax you can make..
 DEIZ21: what rank
 muy31: gold
 LegendsOfCodeAndMagic: mincuding opp answers?
 DEIZ21: 50ms 
 DEIZ21: bizarre
 Beerus: depth depends on actions
 Valdemar: muy31 so you respect possible enemy movement when making decision?
 muy31: yes
 DEIZ21: i need to enhace the opp tracking
 muy31: i actually base it on whether I wan to move aggressively toward enemy or defensively away from it
 DEIZ21: yeh this is a good idea
 DEIZ21: but not minmax
 muy31: no, it is, 
 muy31: in implementation it is
 DEIZ21: i can't see how
 Valdemar: how do you deal with enemy uncertanity?
 DEIZ21: good question
 Valdemar: there is hundred of possible positions
 muy31: i set a score based on how many moves i have left and on how close/far i am from enemy
 DEIZ21: what??
 muy31: i then simulate my turns
 muy31: based on that
 DEIZ21: how do you know how many move you have in the openning and middle game
 JBM: 299 - moves already done
 muy31: i mean like available squares to move on
 Astrobytes: muy31 you're in silver
 muy31: hey no
 muy31: i just got a notification
 muy31: from CG
 Astrobytes: No, they accidentally promoted all of silver to gold earlier, then had to resubmit and recompute
 YannT: it's from a botched league opening
 YannT: everyone got the notification
 muy31: RIP
 DEIZ21: i m ranked 98 silver and your bot just beat mine 3 times
 muy31: nvm
 muy31: me?
 muy31: but my bot is broken right now
 DEIZ21: yes
 muy31: sometimes it tries to go back to a previous square after using silence
 DEIZ21: 5 times
 icecream17: I found a timeout error. Resubmitting
 Beerus: guys try beam search minimax
 DEIZ21: what the hell it beats mine every time
 DEIZ21: you're raked 235 and i 98
 DEIZ21: ok it must be an overall score
 muy31: yeah
 muy31: but you just beat me just now
 DEIZ21: so some strategies doesnt work with somme other even if better raked
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/445161003">https://www.codingame.com/replay/445161003</a>
 muy31: yes that is true
 DEIZ21: how you share?
 Astrobytes: "replay and share" just under the viewer
 muy31: in your match viewer click "replay and share", then copy link
 DEIZ21: ok thx

 muy31: me winning probably had to do with the map
 DEIZ21: 5 times i told u
 YannT: muy31: you still have pathing issues
 YannT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445162438">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/445162438</a>
 YannT: you surface a lot
 muy31: i have those issues b/c of my attempt to  use minimax while moving
 muy31: cause i don't just base it on which squares i can go but also where my opponent could be, as I am trying to get closer
 muy31: emphasis on trying
 muy31: thanks tho YannT
 muy31: ok YannT I can also explain
 muy31: you use a lot of mines, and i mainly use Silence to get away from squares that could be mines
 YannT: but you're killing yourself on a side&#160;:)
 muy31: however, whenever I use SILENCE, there are weird bugs
 muy31: in my move function
 muy31: that i haven't been able to fix
 muy31: Currently, i have started over
 muy31: and am creating a new program
 Illedan: Did you remember to save the path you have been using?
 muy31: yeah i have a boolean array
 muy31: after i move w/ silence or move i set my positions to false accordingly
 muy31: i believe

 JohnyCode: thanks, but it still doesn't say how exactly do I approve
 JohnyCode: do I need a command or smth?
 Westicles: Do you qualify?
 JohnyCode: I have 50 games so I should
 Westicles: Leaderboard says 49.
 JohnyCode: interesting
 JohnyCode: I got the achievement :joy:
 JohnyCode: But thanks, I'll play 1 more
 eulerscheZahl: private clashes don't count for moderation

 martinpapa69: link is not working for me
 eulerscheZahl: oh&#160;:/i copied it from their discord announcement
 eulerscheZahl: blame the user Stone
 JohnyCode: hey, so I definitely have 50+ games now, but I still cannot find the approve button. Where should I look for it?
 Westicles: Can you link what you want to approve?

 JohnyCode: i just noticed that
 JohnyCode: :grimacing::sweat_smile:
 JohnyCode: thank you!
 ProCoder03: is there any good example for MonteCarlo in C#
 ProCoder03:&#160;??
 martinpapa69: its c++ but easy to port i think

 007AhanafAziz: hello
 Wontonimo: hello 007, i have a mission for you
 69razer69: how lonf can be the string input 
 69razer69: long*
 Wontonimo: in what context?  are you making a contribution with a large string output?
 WannaBeHum1n: wow
 WannaBeHum1n: it saves the code you wrote for every question even if it is old
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx developers 
 69razer69: a lot of memory is speard for my dum solutions
 WannaBeHum1n: guys 
 WannaBeHum1n: i am simple javascript guy
 WannaBeHum1n: do i have to build a simulation and work out how to make a genetic algo
 WannaBeHum1n: to get out of gold 
 WannaBeHum1n: in coders strike back xD
 derjack: yes
 WannaBeHum1n: oof
 69razer69: i recommend codingtrain video made using p5js
 69razer69: on gen alg
 Wontonimo: no WannaBeHum1n
 Wontonimo: you can get to gold without GA WannaBeHum1n
 WannaBeHum1n: huh
 WannaBeHum1n: how
 WannaBeHum1n: any tips xD
 derjack: no need for GA. use NN [solved]
 Wontonimo: has anyone told you about PID controllers? or the simplified -3v algo?
 WannaBeHum1n: GOOGLING INTESIFIES
 Wontonimo: you won't find the -3v on google (probably).  It simply means
 Wontonimo: instead of targeting the checkpoint, target checkpoint - 3 * velocity
 WannaBeHum1n: I ASSUME NN MEANS NEURAL NETWORK&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: sorry caps
 69razer69: yup
 WannaBeHum1n: ik that one
 WannaBeHum1n: -3v
 WannaBeHum1n: but 
 WannaBeHum1n: hard stuck at gold
 WannaBeHum1n: 1000 rank
 Wontonimo: let me look at some of your replays
 WannaBeHum1n: i have one that targets next checkpoint
 Wontonimo: just a sec
 WannaBeHum1n: and one that blocks
 WannaBeHum1n: how do i share
 Wontonimo: don't share code here plz
 WannaBeHum1n: i know
 WannaBeHum1n: he asks for replays
 WannaBeHum1n: how do i show replay
 WannaBeHum1n: for u
 martinpapa69: you can share replays with the "replay and share" button
 Wontonimo: for replays, you can click on the share button, it opens a new window.  copy that url. 
 WannaBeHum1n: do i look for a losing one
 Wontonimo: i've looked at a couple replays 
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: u can see already&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: oh
 Wontonimo: it looks like you are probably only subtracting -velocity or -2 velocity
 Wontonimo: are you sure you are using -3 velocity?
 WannaBeHum1n: i was changing the values earlier testing
 WannaBeHum1n: i set it to 3 now
 WannaBeHum1n: testing in areana
 Wontonimo: okay, i see that now
 Wontonimo: nice
 WannaBeHum1n: 25%
 69razer69: so the stub generator how far i can go in string(51656)
 Wontonimo: okay, it doesn't look like you've implemented drifting
 Wontonimo: a super simple first implementation of drifting goes like this:
 Wontonimo: using your current velocity, calculate if your pod would be within 400 of the checkpoint in the next 4 rounds.  if it is, don't target that checkpoint and instead target the next one
 Wontonimo: this will result in early turning and your pod drifting through the checkpoints instead of turning after 
 WannaBeHum1n: wait
 WannaBeHum1n: i can see
 Wontonimo: waiting
 WannaBeHum1n: all the checkpoints
 Wontonimo: yes
 WannaBeHum1n: omg
 WannaBeHum1n: oh god
 WannaBeHum1n: my life is a lie
 WannaBeHum1n: thank you som muck
 WannaBeHum1n: much*
 Wontonimo: np
 Wontonimo: that should boost you several rankings.
 WannaBeHum1n: but how do i calculate the 4 seconfs 
 WannaBeHum1n: distance / velocity&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: right&#160;?
 Wontonimo: for( the count of 4)
 WannaBeHum1n: ah ok
 WannaBeHum1n: ty
 Wontonimo: 4 rounds (not seconds).  sorry bout that
 Wontonimo: after implementing that and seeing that it boosts your ranking a good chunck, implement blocking like so:
 Wontonimo: one pod is your running, the logic it is currently using.  The other becomes a blocker.  The blocker keeps track of the lead opponents next checkpoint.
 Wontonimo: the blocker starts by targeting checkpoint 2, and then camping there to block the lead opponent.
 Wontonimo: once the opponent clears that checkpoint, the blocker races 2 checkpoints ahead and repeats
 Uljahn: it was easier for me to beat the gold with two runners though
 Wontonimo: oh?  do share!
 Uljahn: immediately use boost if a map is not tiny (3 checkpoints) but only by one pod
 Wontonimo: are there multiple boosts available in gold?
 Uljahn: no
 Uljahn: if you boost by both pods they'll collide at the first checkpoint and could miss it
 Wontonimo: you can also use shields to break hard.  if while approaching a checkpoint your pod is facing more than 140 degrees away from the next checkpoint, it is a way to not overshoot
 Wontonimo: not the only way
 WannaBeHum1n: what if me and enemy have same target next 
 WannaBeHum1n: wouldnt blocking hurt me too
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;?
 Uljahn: that's the point of two runners, they barely interact with each other, also it's hard to block both
 WannaBeHum1n: but how do u control the boost
 Wontonimo: good point.  if the blocker moves slightly towards enemy, then no.
 WannaBeHum1n: mine shhot each other
 WannaBeHum1n: literally
 WannaBeHum1n: shoot at satrt
 WannaBeHum1n: start*
 Wontonimo: make pod 1 use boost at beginnig.  pod 2 use boost after 1st checkpoint
 Uljahn: ^
 WannaBeHum1n: ty
 WannaBeHum1n: currently at 476th
 Wontonimo: for the drifting thing, there are definitely better algos, and the closer you get to fully simulating all the mechanics the better, but the simplified version is a good start
 Uljahn: yeah, it's enough for around 300 in legend, no collisions, no GA, just plain move prediction for your pods
 Naknik: mod :o
 derjack: div!
 Wontonimo: abs 
 WannaBeHum1n: sqrt
 eulerscheZahl: pow
 Stilgart: log
 WannaBeHum1n: exp
 WannaBeHum1n: anyonne know how i would count the number of checkmarks my car passed
 eulerscheZahl: with an integer?
 martinpapa69: have you tried using mathematics&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: i want to use the boost for second car after a certain number of checkmarks
 AllYourTrees: what about big data
 WannaBeHum1n: k
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: any other idea for chadok.info&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: ah, I see you implemented the author already
 eulerscheZahl: and deleted puzzles in red, nice
 Wontonimo: hey WannaBeHum1n, every time your car has a different checkpoint than the last, increment a global counter
 Wontonimo: you'll need to also store the checkpoint from last round so you can compare the current and last
 WannaBeHum1n: thank you &lt;3
 michaellan: good morning
 michaellan: in theory, a MCTS can be abstracted over any type of game, given (1) a way to compute "next states" from current state and (2) a function that checks if a position is won/drawn/lost right?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: that's the beauty of it
 michaellan: so in theory... refactoring an MCTS to support another game should be easy -_-
 michaellan: im having a tough time rewriting my TTT into UTTT
 Wontonimo: ah, yeah
 Wontonimo: perhaps first try rewriting your TTT to have the MCTS part in a different class than your TTT part
 Wontonimo: and your MCTS just have a pointer to the TTT class, and all TTT related code and calculations hidden within TTT
 Wontonimo: I actually have them as different files locally, and use a python script to concat them together for submitting to CG
 michaellan: wow thats genius
 michaellan: the one thing im wracking my brain over is
 michaellan: i'm wondering if it's worth abstracting the game logic out of both the rollout/playout and node-expansion functions
 michaellan: since they're super similar in that they both calculate next possible moves
 michaellan: for TTT it was trivial so i didn't bother
 michaellan: oh also, for UTTT: do you have a bool array of length 9 describing which sub-squares are already won/lost/drawn?
 michaellan: i have that right now but i'm wondering if its worth doing since its trading memory for speed
 Wontonimo: i found rollout and expansion to be very different.  don't see how combining them would give any benefit
 Wontonimo: i have 3 bitboards for player1 won, player2 won, tie
 Wontonimo: available positions is 0b11111111 ^ (p1 | p2 | tie )
 michaellan: wow im dumb
 Wontonimo: so, i have a class for MiniBoard, which is the 3x3, and a class for the above which is identical to MiniBoard other than it keep track of ties and the win calculation returns correctly
 michaellan: wdym by win calculation returns correctly
 Wontonimo: then the UltimateBoard class which has 9 miniboards and 1 of the modified like above
 Wontonimo: the modified version with ties doesn't just return win/loss if there is a line.  If there is no line and no spaces left, it returns a win for the player with the most squares
 Wontonimo: you can get rid of the "0b11111111^" if your p1 p2 and tie bitboards are inversed (0 for used , 1 for free)
 Wontonimo: and you used &amp; instead of |
 Wontonimo: i don't do that, but i've been thinking about making the change for optimization.  it does have some drawbacks elsewhere, so i've not been motivated
 oxydowe: Hi, is there any reason python walrus operator cannot be used in code golf unless it is parenthesized?
 michaellan: yeah, Wontonimo, like for ties
 michaellan: i think
 michaellan: oxydowe, are you speaking more generally than just in code golf?
 michaellan: probably order of operations-related?
 oxydowe: xxd if I remember correctly, in clash of code I can write a:=2 but in code golf I need to (a:=2)
 Astrobytes: Have you tried the egg man operator?
 akhil2310: yooooooooooooooooo
 oxydowe: my bad, also in CoC a:=2 is invalid syntax and needs parenthesis
 Wontonimo: koo koo kachoo
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1488399_4E12W.jpg">https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1488399_4E12W.jpg</a>
 Andriamanitra: @oxydowe it depends on context, you can't write a:=2 on top level, it should be fine inside most expressions though
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: At least someone got it&#160;:)
 oxydowe: ok, I just discovered you can write l=[a:=0] but you cannot write l[a:=0] and you need l[(a:=0)]... wow
 7-4: rap me in plactic and make me shine
 7-4: i know u can fus  me and u
 Astrobytes: 7-4: Are you unwell in some way?
 BAruch: {
 dsfjkfdls: huihuihiuhuihi
 Atanasius: wkwkwkwk
 Andriamanitra: @oxydowe that's probably because when you're using [] as indexing operator&#160;: has a special meaning (slice)
 Swyfti: username change lmao
 HeroicRobot_cf06: Sup
 Swyfti: my current username resembles my real name
 HeroicRobot_cf06: if(1+1 == 3)
 Wontonimo: swifty&#160;?
 Swyfti: yes
 Swyfti: that is somewhat my real name
 Swyfti: not exactly
 Swyfti: somewhat
 Swyfti: by the way im a master now so... Horray!
 Wontonimo: congrats&#160;!
 Wontonimo: From this day forward you will be known as Master Swyfti  (on CG, if we remember)
 Swyfti: thank you
 Swyfti: i am starting ghostbusters any tips people?
 BlaiseEbuth: Catch the ghosts
 Swyfti: no like the algorithm
 Astrobytes: Ghost Catching Algorithm #42
 Astrobytes: :P
 Swyfti: POG
 BlaiseEbuth: You can take a look to the Spengler-Venkman algorithm.
 Swyfti: I KNOW IT NOW
 Swyfti: print('42')
 TobiasA: if(thereIsGhost):catchGhost()
 Swyfti: well you also have to cosider abilities
 eulerscheZahl: don't catch the ghost. catch the tryangles
 Swyfti: i catch the tryhards
 Swyfti: the tryhard ghosts
 Swyfti: now f this imma start a 2 hour coding montage
 eulerscheZahl: finally my MCTS solver seems to be working
 Wontonimo: in all seriousness, i have a basic bot on that.  It keeps a fog of war map
 Wontonimo: the busters try and find an unexplored area and go there
 TobiasA: i like watching MCTS solver seem to work
 Wontonimo: it shouldn't "seem to work"
 TobiasA: my minimax seems to work only with two players in tron
 BlaiseEbuth: I maintain the Spengler-Venkman algorithm is a good choice for CB.
 Swyfti: my ai is insane
 Swyfti: its too insane
 Swyfti: its like playing atomic chess on lichess.org
 eulerscheZahl: Wontonimo i like how our evaluations are almost in perfect sync <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575179114">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575179114</a>
 eulerscheZahl: adding up to 100%
 eulerscheZahl: the solver is still wrong
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: nevermind, was watching an old replay :D
 TobiasA: that looks perfect in my eye
 eulerscheZahl: you are the questionmark face, aren't you? you changed your avatar
 TobiasA: yea
 TobiasA: do you recognize my pattern of speech:laughing:
 TobiasA: oh my name:no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: eulerscheZahl , I'm not happy that my C4 code jumps from 54% to solved in 1 turn, as you can see from that replay.  Something fishy is going on in my code i think
 TobiasA: isn't solved good?
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's good, but i'd like to see the previous move be around 80% or 90%... just kinda fishy that it jumps
 Wontonimo: i don't check for instant next move win conditions in rollout, which may help
 Wontonimo: i also don't handle ties in any sensible way in the solver
 jacek: 54% to win isn't weird if opponent made a mistake
 jacek: beware of 54% to lose
 jacek: or 0.8 to lose for some my bots in some games ;s
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/575179114">https://www.codingame.com/replay/575179114</a> after move 33 it was a win for me.
 Wontonimo: but my bot only reported a 54%.  looks like i have me a unit test
 ReiKiriyama: Im trying Amazons puzzle but I don't get it why d3a1h7 is invalid move when color is 'w' and field d3 is occupied by my white queen?
 BlaiseEbuth: Dura lex sed lex...
 ReiKiriyama: (a1 and h7 is empty)
 Nox05: std::getline(std::cin, Str)
 eulerscheZahl: MCTS: rank 23MCTS with solver: rank 23
 eulerscheZahl: sigh
 eulerscheZahl: at least i have something where I can put my bandas sim into
 jacek: ReiKiriyama do you have replay or screen?

 martinpapa69: at least you didnt completly break your bot with solver
 jacek: you cant move from d3 to a1
 BlaiseEbuth: On this chat mods complain about their code, and trolls help users...
 ReiKiriyama: haha ah I forgot that it can only move like a queen. Thanks for that hint
 jacek: ReiKiriyama its indexed from 1
 TobiasA:  /me is waiting for BlaiseEbuth to complain about his code
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not a mod.
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm a troll in disguise
 TobiasA: help me with my code
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't want to compromise my cover.
 TobiasA: understood
 jacek: are you trolltech ceo
 Swyfti: trolltech?
 Swyfti: can i join that company
 Litcatdad: is trolltech looking for unpaid and lazy interns?
 martinpapa69: stop trolling, this chat is for serious topics
 AllYourTrees: i love trolling
 BlaiseEbuth: And normal users take themselves for mods...
 martinpapa69: my dad is a mod, dont make me call him
 enzoROD: XD
 BlaiseEbuth: martinpapa69... I'm your dad.
 martinpapa69: hi dad, new account&#160;?
 Moontasir: hello&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup. Need to change a little
 AllYourTrees: how deep are people exploring in C4 with mcts?
 Scarfield: you mean EPT depth? so far im just doing standard mcts - untill game over
 AllYourTrees: like how many levels are there in your tree at the end of one of your turns
 AllYourTrees: the max depth that node selection goes
 Scarfield: max depth, potentially until draw - full board
 Wontonimo: i'm adding that to my bot, just a sec AllYourTrees
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575190480">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575190480</a>
 Wontonimo: it's the number after the k
 AllYourTrees: interesting okay thats about the same for me, i was surprised at how deep it gets
 AllYourTrees: though i guess once a couple columns are full there aren't very many actions?
 Wontonimo: 19 on first move, 13, and 27 near the end
 AllYourTrees: i wasn't sure if i had a bug that was pruning too much lol. ty Wontonimo!
 Scarfield: oh you at rank 11, nice :muscle:
 AllYourTrees: :D i definitely recognize your icon scar lol
 Scarfield: club top 300&#160;;)
 AllYourTrees: :joy:
 Scarfield: euler and wonto dropped my rank a bit though&#160;:'(
 AllYourTrees: yeah there seems to be a lot of activity on C4 lately
 Wontonimo: it's a pretty straight forward port of UTTT, i think that's part of the draw
 Wontonimo: if you skip all the fancy c4 specific tricks
 Scarfield: currently im just cleaning up the mess of a bot i made a few months ago. the other day i realised i used the wrong mask when checking for one of the diagonals, gained about 30 ranks fixing that xD
 jacek: general mcts tricks apply there
 Wontonimo: i'm not saying it's "easy" or quick, don't get me wrong.  i'm just saying that it's less work than starting from scratch if you already have uttt
 Scarfield: i still start from scratch, my scripts improve slightly every time
 jacek: time for ultimate c4
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 Scarfield: oO
 Wontonimo: 9 c4 tables, you play on the one where your opponent played the col of last
 darkhorse64: 567 moves max, it's not that too much for CG constraints
 Wontonimo: I really doubt it would be more than 256 moves for 99% of games
 martinpapa69: sound like a perfect game for minimax
 darkhorse64: If you switch to 6x7 with 7 boards, game duration looks more reasonable
 Wontonimo: anyone able to help me understand what nonsense happened here&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/575191649">https://www.codingame.com/replay/575191649</a>
 martinpapa69: your bot decided that its a guaranteed lose&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what's weird is that my bot seemed to think things were going really well, and tric knew he won way ahead that my bot had a clue
 Q12: are you using MCTS?
 Wontonimo: sigh, guess i'm gonna have to read the c4 how-to afterall
 Wontonimo: MCTS + Solver + mem pool 
 Scarfield: you do have steal implemented right? only obvious bug i can spot
 darkhorse64: + bitboard
 Wontonimo: yeah, i got bitboard.
 darkhorse64: avx&#160;?
 martinpapa69: mathematics?
 Astrobytes: prune array?
 Wontonimo: oh man, i forgot about math
 Wontonimo: what's the steal but you see Scarfield?
 Scarfield: Prunebytes
 Astrobytes: Scarfarray
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: just the only thing i thought could be an obvious mistake, that your bot has a bug when first move is "stolen"
 Wontonimo: on move 17 it would have tried to "complete" col 1 if that was the case.  Thanks though, I hadn't really double check that section until now
 jacek: maybe i should come back to c4? would you like that
 Q12: your bot should have block the opponent in the end of the game, I think
 Wontonimo: I see how the prune array would help Astrobytes
 Scarfield: any news on your back astro btw?
 Wontonimo: lol Q12.  wouldn't have mattered.  he would have won 2 moves after that
 Scarfield: ^
 Q12: ohh, I see it know :sweat_smile:
 AllYourTrees: does everyone using solver just prune solved nodes completely?
 jacek: still you could choose the longest lose
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: nope. Still waiting on that scan. We have millions of people on waiting lists here now.
 Scarfield: if the tric says he has won, its probably true
 jacek: a tiny chance opponent wouldnt see his win
 Wontonimo: yeah, you are right jacek.  that is an issue of my current mcts
 Scarfield: damn astro, sad to hear that. had hoped you would have been scanned by now
 Astrobytes: Yeah. It's really a living hell tbh. I have good pain tolerance but ffs.
 Gabbek: Hello everyone&#160;:)
 jacek: ohai
 Astrobytes: Hello Gabbek!
 AllYourTrees: wait astro what happened??
 Astrobytes: Long story AllYourTrees
 Gabbek: Hi, hi! I'm trying to catch up - something's wrong Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: For over a year now yes lol
 Wontonimo: AllYourTrees, I don't prune solved.
 Gabbek: Yikes... I should chat more often&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Nah. I'm ok just got bad bones.
 jacek: drink more milk
 Astrobytes: I don't have a calcium deficiency.
 Scarfield: problem solved
 BlaiseEbuth: Garlic cloves got him...&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: That was the hand
 Astrobytes: *hand/wrist
 Astrobytes: That still hurts a lot some days btw
 jacek: back or wrist
 Scarfield: you need a skeleton transplant
 Astrobytes: hand
 Astrobytes: Pretty much Scarfield
 jacek: buy one of those boobs mousepad, they work wonders
 Q12: did you consider in your solver states in which your opponent can't put in a column because you will won if he will? like turn 15 Wontonimo
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 jacek: for your wrist
 Astrobytes: Wrong wrist
 Scarfield: preferably with mlp design
 jacek: hmm they exist <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1Y5jlXI_vK1RkSmRyq6xwupXaB/my-little-pony-mouse-pad-900x300mm-pad-to-mouse-long-notbook-computer-mousepad-cute-gaming-padmouse.jpg_q50.jpg">https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1Y5jlXI_vK1RkSmRyq6xwupXaB/my-little-pony-mouse-pad-900x300mm-pad-to-mouse-long-notbook-computer-mousepad-cute-gaming-padmouse.jpg_q50.jpg</a>
 Scarfield: i am an organ donpr, maybe i can specify my bones are belong to yo astro
 Wontonimo: yeah Q12, i think that's what prune array is that astro was referring to
 Astrobytes: I'm an organ donor too, swapsies
 BlaiseEbuth: All your bones are belong to us
 Scarfield: im not surprised jace, not checking the link though xD
 Scarfield: nema
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Nah. Prune array is part of cegimax. Just a CG meme :P
 jacek: ceg meme
 Wontonimo: ah ... colour me uncultured
 Astrobytes: that too
 Astrobytes: It was a while ago Wontonimo
 Gabbek: I was jealous of legend optimization badge you guys have... so I've decided to push it from silver :p reached 2% on optimization for gold and then saw the next task -- 2% on cold golf... and all of my will power is gone :P
 Gabbek: what's the final task for legend optimization badge, I wonder?
 jacek: 2% on code golf, then nothing
 jacek: final flag will give you 500 xp
 Gabbek: oh, so 2% on code golf is final? That's nice to know, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: Gabbek there you go<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 Gabbek: Good day, eulerscheZahl!
 Gabbek: How's going, what are you up to lately?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: reclaiming #1 on the global leaderboard
 Scarfield: wait, when did db dr take 2nd?
 eulerscheZahl: he was first for a while
 BlaiseEbuth: dbdr?
 Gabbek: nice, congrats - I was trying out code rings lately, really fun... but those top scores are pretty amazing - I've run out of ideas, maybe I'll try again in few weeks
 Gabbek: The frog will rule us all&#160;:)
 Scarfield: an tric on 4th, seems like the global leaderboard has changed a lot the past few monts
 Gabbek: wasn't there some kind of bugged user which was #1 on the leaderboard? I remember talking about it with Zylo few weeks ago
 eulerscheZahl: my code of the ring is a beam search done offline (validators are testcases with a=z, b=y, ...)
 eulerscheZahl: testing all possible chars. then making sure that i don't print the wrong thing
 Gabbek: interesting - I've noticed that might be the case with my basic solution when I've implemented incrementing pattern detection and firstly done only positive ones
 eulerscheZahl: loops really help. the beam found some interesting ones
 Gabbek: any double loops? I couldn't figure out any useful ones
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have nested
 Gabbek: but yeah, surely the search is the way to go - guess I'll try to do something like that, but I'm not really sure how to go about it, will be fun experience&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575197739">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575197739</a>that's something i wouldn't see if playing by hand
 eulerscheZahl: hm, somehow it stops playing when i open it in a new tab
 eulerscheZahl: btw that game has an easter "egg". or more like easter bunnies
 eulerscheZahl: when you print a comma
 Gabbek: hmm, same issue after turn 12 or so
 AllYourTrees: hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: i'll generate a new replay
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/575198194">https://www.codingame.com/replay/575198194</a>
 eulerscheZahl: same bug
 AllYourTrees: just realized i've been selecting actions based on avg value instead of num visits this whole time
 AllYourTrees: not sure how much that matters lol
 Gabbek: nice pattern, I like it! Indeed a good one; wouldn't notice it by hand myself for sure
 eulerscheZahl: those numbers are closely correlated, doesn't matter
 Gabbek: I'm guessing that the long sentence has the biggest savings - do you know how many characters you had on the final test?
 eulerscheZahl: on "24 long spell"?
 eulerscheZahl: 1184
 eulerscheZahl: and no loops at all in this one
 eulerscheZahl: i allowed loops but my search opted against
 Gabbek: I would like to check mine as well but having issues with my internet at the moment, guess I'll be check to check in a minute or two
 Gabbek: 1278, a lot of jumping back and forth - only one loop to initialize all runes to O
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should try that too and hardcode my start for the search to continue
 Gabbek: you could try to set all initial runes to O and run the search - maybe it'll find a better solution; my loop to initialize all runes is 27 characters
 eulerscheZahl: let me see if i can easily tell the search that i want to init my memory instead of printing
 eulerscheZahl: no, that looks complicated to add
 eulerscheZahl: and I last touched that code in january
 shayah_goba: deez nutz
 Gabbek: could you tell me a little bit about your beam search in code rings? All characters are actions and you interpret current solutions and if they are invalid you discard them?
 eulerscheZahl: pretty much. there are only &lt;&gt;+-[].
 eulerscheZahl: i filter a bit during generation already. like no + right after -
 eulerscheZahl: or no ] without [no . if that would print something invalid
 eulerscheZahl: removing different paths that create the same state (memory relative to bilbo position, possibly mirrored)
 eulerscheZahl: the current loop body must be handled too when it comes to hashing
 eulerscheZahl: and a really wide beam (half a million), takes maybe 10 minutes to finish on the last testcase
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/bilbo.txt">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/bilbo.txt</a>
 Gabbek: cool, will try a bit with beam search then, since so far I've only used some patterns recognition and some loops; I've tried to make use of [&gt;] with something like 6 letters space 6 letters space etc. -- but it didn't seem to yield good results
 eulerscheZahl: [+] to clear a cell
 Gabbek: yep, it's very useful - haven't found a good use for [&gt;] sadly
 eulerscheZahl: [&gt;.] maybe?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575202004">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/575202004</a>a little longer but still a short loop
 Gabbek: for [&gt;.] you would probably need some efficient way to initialize all runes to different values which you would want to use, say for alphabet -- but that one seems to be very short anyway
 eulerscheZahl: and it stops playing again
 Gabbek: yep, I have the same pattern, guess beam search is yielding much better results for all tests named "spell x" - as those require the most dancing around and that's why my solution fails the most I think
 Gabbek: have you played legends of code &amp; magic with 2 lines version?
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/68194451cf54dd36cc8c817f355e5a44a06062">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/68194451cf54dd36cc8c817f355e5a44a06062</a>
 michaellan: It's possible to draw a UTTT game right?
 eulerscheZahl: no. i already hated the 1 lane version and swore never to touch it again (maybe just too little depth for a 1 month contest, making me biased)
 eulerscheZahl: i know about that version. there was even a contest about it, antisquid won some money
 eulerscheZahl: ties in UTTT are possible
 Gabbek: I see, I can understand your point - even 2 lanes version isn't much deeper, drain seems more useful and there's a bit more tactic, but in general it's very similar
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't play the 1 month contest which was exhausting
 eulerscheZahl: i was smart enough to skip the first 2 weeks and join late. still not late enough to have a full week without ideas how to improve but mental inability to just stop
 reCurse: Yeah really disappointing for a 1 month contest
 reCurse: Looks just good enough to make you think there's depth and then you scratch and nope
 eulerscheZahl: glad that OOC worked out better
 Gabbek: there's so much content... I just can't decide what I wanna do next - but I must say that I always appreciate all the insight, hopefully one day I'll be able to share some back as well&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: peckman was just 2 weeks after ooc 
 Gabbek: greatly enjoyed OOC and code of ice and fire - but only multi versions, wasn't around for contests
 Gabbek: by the way eulerscheZahl - code with me plugin is being developed for rider, should be ready in about 6 months if I'm no mistaken
 eulerscheZahl: is that similar to the VS code share?
 Gabbek: works really nicely in pycharm so the c# version will be great as well I think
 Gabbek: I would say it's much better
 AntiSquid: the trend says there's one contest less each year:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/woM9Ilj">https://imgur.com/a/woM9Ilj</a>
 eulerscheZahl: *live sharethat's how it's called
 Gabbek: had a lot of issues with code share in visual studio, works a bit better in visual code, that's for sure
 eulerscheZahl: did that once with illedan
 Gabbek: yeah - *live share, right
 eulerscheZahl: i was scrolling down. but the screen content didn't change (or instantly revert)
 eulerscheZahl: then i looked at illedan's screen (he was sharing on discord at the same time)
 eulerscheZahl: and he was like "why is the same block of code duplicated 15 times?"
 eulerscheZahl: then VS Code just crashed
 eulerscheZahl: fun times
 Gabbek: I tried to use VS code and visual studio versions, had a lot of issues with visual studio version - mostly with highlighting either bugging out or not working at all and having to rejoin the session every 15-20min or so, or just random disconnects, crashes etc.
 elderlybeginner: in fantastic bits, throw is calculated after wizzard thrust being calculated, movement done - or before that?
 Gabbek: while the pycharm "code with me" experience was insanely smooth, same with intellij
 eulerscheZahl: i never tried pycharm
 eulerscheZahl: i only that the IntelliJ community edition
 Gabbek: elderlybeginner - wish I could help, but I haven't touched fantastic bits yet at all
 eulerscheZahl: works fine overall. sometimes the typing is a tiny bit laggy
 AntiSquid: need more memory
 eulerscheZahl: i have touched fantastic bits years ago, no memory
 jacek: AntiSquid why so low in amazons
 AntiSquid: idk
 AntiSquid: forgot what that even is
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Fantastic%20Bits/RefereePuzzle.java">https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Fantastic%20Bits/RefereePuzzle.java</a>good luck
 eulerscheZahl: just 2.7k lines to dig through
 AntiSquid: do you pay for pycharm Gabbek&#160;?
 Gabbek: there's a quite nice deal on jetbrains - if you know jetbrains academy you get all products license for 1 month for free, which can be replenished every month
 Gabbek: if you join* and solve 3 topics
 jacek: is this like winrar license
 eulerscheZahl: i prefer free and mostly open source software
 eulerscheZahl: that's also why i use linux over windows. and because i can use it more efficiently
 AntiSquid: winrar doesn't autoupdate does it&#160;?
 Gabbek: I do pay for pycharm, but it's mostly because I really like how they handle support and design their stuff - also a big fan of jetbrains academy, not gonna lie&#160;:)
 elderlybeginner: Thanks eulerscheZahlThere are not many bots I'm higher they you, so mayby you should give it a second try&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i can assure you that i could counter you if i would try hard enough&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: jetbrains seems to do heavy advertising, there were lots of free entry raffles for 1 year free license (in my area) Gabbek
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_1594312643ZJjYcJUFWIf8Tw1sLQExQy.jpg">https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_1594312643ZJjYcJUFWIf8Tw1sLQExQy.jpg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's winzip jacek
 eulerscheZahl: totally off topic
 AntiSquid: the weird windows stuff all looks the same anyway
 eulerscheZahl: jetbrains also organizes Kotlin Heroes every few months on codeforces
 Gabbek: I like when you're a long lasting customer and you pay less - that and how jetbrains academy is evolving, always something new to learn, it's quite chill place to do some refreshments or learn a bit of java for fun (I pretty much don't know anything, but nerchio uses a lot of java -- and we sometimes write something together, so it's fun!)
 jacek: i like ketchup
 elderlybeginner: I guess you could have done it with minimal effort
 eulerscheZahl: i like spaghetti napoli
 AntiSquid: do you use the paid version of intellj over the community one? and what for Gabbek&#160;?
 reCurse: Jetbrains makes good products but every time I try using them it feels so bloated&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: ReSharper
 jacek: sound javaish
 reCurse: Well good news for them, visual studio is on 64 bits now so they can eat away all the memory without crashing now
 michaellan: how did you guys print out debuggign boards for UTTT
 michaellan: im thinking of using colors to represent wins on the big board
 Wontonimo: cerr
 michaellan: i meant ilke how did you print them out
 eulerscheZahl: not for UTTT but usually i draw .png files
 Gabbek: AntiSquid I'll be honest - I only use pycharm paid version but I don't really use paid features much, think rider with resharper and some other tools would be more useful - like dotpeak and dotmemory if someone would write a lot of azure functions for example
 Wontonimo: i'll send you my code xxd
 Wontonimo: just the print
 michaellan: hmm im actually half done with writing my own
 michaellan: thanks though
 Gabbek: I'm curious - any thoughts on rider vs visual studio? Whenever I use visual studio I feel like my PC is about to explode...&#160;:(
 reCurse: Visual Studio anytime
 reCurse: Not that it's not bloated but less so I think
 leftnut: reading these problem take some getting used to. Took me 30 minutes to figure out what to do for Batman

 jacek: NN ftw
 BlaiseEbuth: What happened 18 days ago? I'm currently looking to old puzzles I solved years ago, and there's many where my C++ solution was re-submitted 18 days ago... :thinking:
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: Thor golf recalc was 18 days ago
 Astrobytes: The Day of Mjölnir
 jacek: thursday?
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yes. So this is perfectly logic that some old solutions to medium puzzles were submited back.
 Gabbek: Very wild guess - do you have auto-submit turned on? Maybe 18 days ago solutions which were not visible were re-submited, for some reason?
 BlaiseEbuth: Auto-submit?
 Gabbek: I think it's in settings, it basically auto-submits your solution to the problem so you don't have to do it manually
 Gabbek: let me have a look - haven't touched it in a very long time
 michaellan: How do i calculate winrate in MCTS?
 AntiSquid: auto-publish
 jacek: win / visits
 michaellan: (for entertainment purposes)
 michaellan: oh, seriously?
 michaellan: then my winrate is about 10% only?
 BlaiseEbuth: Publish you mean Gabbek?
 Gabbek: ah yes, sorry - publish, that's correct
 michaellan: I'm... scared right now. Just turned my TTT MCTS into UTTT MCTS, cleaned up compiler errors... and it _seems_ to work
 jacek: what rank
 michaellan: wait havent tested on CG yet
 Wontonimo: well publish and let's look
 Wontonimo: :D
 michaellan: only 100ms to make a move...
 Wontonimo: yuppers
 michaellan: probably better than my current strategy of randomly choosing a move
 michaellan: oh nooo i have to take in CG input, a most daunting task :cry:
 Wontonimo: lol
 jacek: oh my
 Wontonimo: alright, i gotta go.  laters
 michaellan: my bot consistently draws against itself so i think thats a good sign
 michaellan: have a good day
 Gabbek: good night Wontonimo
 xxd: can i ignore taking in the input
 xxd: im not sure how that would work
 jacek: the input is opponent's move
 xxd: yeah but theres a bunch more lines
 jacek: how can you sim without the actual game
 xxd: aftter that
 Gabbek: you have to take the input as it includes opponent's move
 xxd: yeah i am wondering if i can just take first line
 jacek: you can ignore the possible moves since you make them yourself
 jacek: you still need the cin, input() or whatever, just dont use them
 69razer69: talking about breakthrough
 Astrobytes: what about breakthrough?
 juice0: i think he was wondering if they were just talking about breakthrough, regarding ignoring inputs
 Astrobytes: This is why the '?' exists.
 Gabbek: '?' seems to be one of most useful characters, so much meaning in just one symbol :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe not wrong
 juice0: yes but you have to hold that other key down to do it.  just playing devil's advocate here but that's a lot of work
 Astrobytes: hah!
 Westicles: I think he was talking about today's shocking news
 xxd: huh

 BlaiseEbuth: :flushed:
 Gabbek: CGStatementDL - I was thinking about creating something which would download all available testcases and maybe setup a project or something
 Gabbek: because I ended up doing it manually so many times... :D
 Astrobytes: "This article is a preprint and has not been certified by peer review [what does this mean?]. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice"
 Gabbek: I know it's about downloading statement, but just thinking out loud
 Westicles: Mayo clinic is solid.. 
 Astrobytes: "has not been certified by peer review"
 Astrobytes: Everyone makes mistakes. I haven't even looked further than that statement.
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't. But I don't test vaccines.
 Astrobytes: What's the 'big news' part anyway Westicles?
 Astrobytes: *shocking news sorry
 Westicles: The results?
 Gabbek: good night everyone, have a good one!
 Astrobytes: gn Gabbek
 Astrobytes: I was hoping you were going to summarize them Westicles since I'm doing about 40 other things right now :P
 Westicles: Well, we don't want to rush to conclusions.  There are a a million news articles out there with better interpretation than I could give
 ja_fica: MSmits, you there=
 ja_fica:&#160;?
 reCurse: "don't want to rush to conclusions" "a million news articles out there" :thinking:
 reCurse: Sounds contradictory
 Westicles: It is big news
 ja_fica: Imagine this
 reCurse: News articles are mostly about rushing to conclusions these days
 ja_fica: In C++, we have 2 functions optimized with O3 and inline and they are declared just one after the other, nothing in between. Changing the order of declaration should impact the performance of any?
 reCurse: No
 ja_fica: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://aipuzzles.com/learn/performance">https://aipuzzles.com/learn/performance</a>   -    see random generator
 ja_fica: it happens
 ja_fica: experiment trade the 2 random functions
 ja_fica: It has the same behavior in my computer as well
 ja_fica: You can even try to have the same logic in both functions, the first function declared will have a higher performance... it makes no sense
 ja_fica: My guess is that inlining is not properly conceived
 reCurse: "With this 3 lines of code in the beggining of the script we can spare some time and make a more readable code along the rest of the script." I will resist commenting on this
 reCurse: Can you post a proper example on godbolt?
 ja_fica: forget about that, just copy paste the code of the random generator
 ja_fica: the last module of that page
 reCurse: Can you make a godbolt?
 ja_fica: Never heard of it, let me try
 reCurse: godbolt.org
 reCurse: Use the right compiler and options, inspect assembly, you can even share it here I'm curious to take a look
 ja_fica: But have you tried to swap the 2 functions?
 ja_fica: Im in there now, I will let you know what i can find
 reCurse: It's going to be much simpler if you do it than if I try to figure out what you did

 reCurse: So you swap fastRand1 and fastRand2 in code?
 reCurse: Their order?
 ja_fica: Yes
 ja_fica: It makes no sense
 ja_fica: Tell me when you believe me plz, im not such a noob in C++, but i can't figure this out
 Pro-grammer: nice
 Pro-grammer: wont my first clash of code
 Pro-grammer: won*
 reCurse: That's an interesting one indeed
 ja_fica: told you&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: do you swap the order in the main function too?
 ja_fica: it makes no diffenrece
 reCurse: Hah that's a gcc quirk
 ja_fica: it only affects chaning the declaration, I guess is a cache miss problem
 reCurse: clang behaves like you'd expect, no difference
 reCurse: So probably some gcc quirk, wouldn't be the first one
 reCurse: It decides to inline the first one it encounters in declaration but not the other
 reCurse: clang inlines everything
 ja_fica: so its a gcc problem, i would say bug
 reCurse: I'd say quirk
 reCurse: It's not erroneous behavior, optimization is left to the compiler
 ja_fica: damm, so I can't force it?
 reCurse: Sure you can
 ja_fica: I really would like both of them inlined
 reCurse: __attribute__((always_inline))
 reCurse: Just be careful not to abuse it
 ja_fica: yes, if the code gets to big it will increase cache misses
 reCurse: Or just use a proper compiler :P
 ja_fica: it didn0t work&#160;:(
 reCurse:&#160;? worked for me
 ja_fica: can you paste the code?
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/z/4M8aKMEhx">https://godbolt.org/z/4M8aKMEhx</a>
 ja_fica: It must be a compiler issue as that code is not running in my computer with gcc
 reCurse: Which version of gcc is that?
 ja_fica: 7.5.0
 ja_fica: i will just update it
 reCurse: Uh, weird compile error, seems like a bug maybe
 reCurse: Code is not using target specific stuff as far as I see
 ja_fica: It worked

 xxd: a naive, bitboarded MCTS for UTTT is around what league?
 RaulButuc: I still recall it being a bit unpleasant to code, had tons of fun with challenges like LOCAM
 xxd: ah, there are just so many things to keep track in LOCAM i sorta am putting that one on hold
 xxd: what type of bots are for imperfect information games, what did you use?
 RaulButuc: True, idk why but that one matches my style more than some of the other bot challenges around here :D
 RaulButuc: for LOCAM I ended up using monte carlo
 xxd: but how do you siimulate opponents moves?
 xxd: oh nvm
 xxd: is your simulation just all the things you can do on your turn, randomized?
 xxd: and you have aan evaluation function for the output of your turn
 RaulButuc: well in this sort of game you dont really "simulate it" per se
 RaulButuc: sort of
 RaulButuc: i went for brute force
 RaulButuc: performed better than randomised
 xxd: hrmm :thinking:
 RaulButuc: you have to set a narrow time limt
 RaulButuc: tweaking the formula for the evaluation is also a bit of a hit and miss :D

 xxd: i assume its pretty important 
 reCurse: If you don't reach legend probably not important
 xxd: oh
 RaulButuc: im stuck in higher gold on UTTT and I havent used it

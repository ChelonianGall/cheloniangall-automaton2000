 drdrdr: start
 Godot30: hi guys, new here, how can i start learning python with these puzzle? what puzzle should i choose? where should i start&#160;? 
 Uljahn: start with easy puzzles, look for most solved like the Descent and Power of Thor ep.1, these two have a hints button on the left
 ChampionCoder: Mars lander episode 1 is also pretty good
 ChampionCoder: Episode 2 is crazy hard
 bafian: the "my last play" function does not work right&#160;?
 rekaxem: what is mars lander 2 about
 jacek: flying on earth
 Uljahn: isn't it about Musk colonizing Mars?
 captainnarwal: how can i race my pod with my friend in coders strike back
 jacek: you can choose a player under the ide
 captainnarwal: thanks mate
 captainnarwal: but i cant search my frnd
 captainnarwal: do i have to be in same league
 Uljahn: guess it works for top-1000 players
 Fun007fun: Hello!
 Uljahn: yep, top-1000 players of your current league and below
 captainnarwal: means if i am in silver league i can play with top 1000 of bronze league
 Uljahn: nope, means that if silver is smaller than 1k you'll get some from top bronze
 captainnarwal: but its not showing the people i follow
 captainnarwal: me and my frnd are both in bottom of silver leagues 
 Fun007fun: respect
 gatitos: what are the league things you guys are takling about
 captainnarwal: in coders strike back the pod races have leagues
 gatitos: what is coder strike back
 gatitos: i only play coding game
 gatitos: the clash of code t hing
 Uljahn: it's a multiplayer thing, also it has a tutorial

 Carsonfanboy: hey guys
 Mr.intro: hi
 jacek: ohai
 Carsonfanboy: can  u help me with a problem?
 Carsonfanboy: i am doing the porcupine fever thing
 Fun007fun: you guys just don't eat dinner?
 Carsonfanboy: no 
 Carsonfanboy: but later i will
 Fun007fun: :smile:
 Carsonfanboy: can u help me with a lil problem pls?
 Carsonfanboy: it says:
 Carsonfanboy: TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
 Carsonfanboy: what can i do about it?
 Fun007fun: maybe other guys can help you
 zhoubou: You will need to show your code if you want to be helped
 Fun007fun: i am puzzled
 Fun007fun: yep
 Carsonfanboy: ok 
 Carsonfanboy: should i just send my code in the chat?
 zhoubou: Send a relevant snippet
 Carsonfanboy: for i in range(n): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1ea89b22-b294-4cbc-94ce-168de105f721">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1ea89b22-b294-4cbc-94ce-168de105f721</a>
 Fun007fun: if it's not a secret,you can
 mzbear: if he doesn't know what's causing the error, he might not know what's relevant either&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Good point
 Carsonfanboy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b677d799-744c-4f4f-8f0f-43f9c51c53e0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b677d799-744c-4f4f-8f0f-43f9c51c53e0</a>
 Carsonfanboy: this ist the whole code
 mzbear: a,k,g are all integers, therefore you have one dimensonal array of int ... but you treat it as two dimensional
 Carsonfanboy: ok...
 Carsonfanboy: how can i fix this
 Fun007fun: porcupines should be a list
 Carsonfanboy: porcupines = list()
 Carsonfanboy: it is
 Passifi: Bonjour&#160;!
 Carsonfanboy: hi
 zhoubou: Carsonfanboy  A single porcupine should be a list [a, k, g] instead of appending a, k, and g separately. Then use indices to access them
 Fun007fun: BonsoirÔºÅ
 Carsonfanboy: ok ill try
 Carsonfanboy: thank u guys
 zhoubou:&#160;:)
 Fun007fun: what a nice thing that you got it
 Carsonfanboy: no i dont got it but i see the problem XD
 Carsonfanboy: and now i try to find a solution XP
 zhoubou: Feel free to DM me if you get stuck
 Carsonfanboy: ok thank u 
 Fun007fun: Sorry,but what's mean of "XD","XP"and"DM":joy:
 zhoubou: XD and XP are smileys with crossed eyes. DM is direct message
 Passifi: XD is a type of crazed smile XP is experience dm is a privat message
 Passifi: or XP is also a smily good to know
 Passifi:&#160;:)
 Fun007fun: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Fun007fun: like this?
 zhoubou: Yeah
 Fun007fun: haha
 Passifi: I think XD used to be more popular in the olden days
 Fun007fun: :yum:
 Passifi: before we had emojis bcak then we used to say rofl which is also pretty dead *nostalgicfeelings*
 Fun007fun: :joy: is also very popular
 therealbeef: roflmao
 SPDene: roflshtcicoomn
 Passifi: I know roflmao is roflshticicoomn a real thing&#160;? :thinking:
 SPDene: laughing so hard that coke (cola, not the other type) is coming out of my nose
 Passifi: oh wow :D
 Passifi: those were the days then people began saying lol in real life and we knew things went to far 
 Fun007fun: wow,time flies
 Fun007fun: i need to have a easy dinner, so you next time guys
 Passifi: Salut
 MSmits: hi
 zhoubou: :hand_splayed:
 Carsonfanboy: i think that they should add the "excuse me wtf emogi" from fallout as an emogi
 Carsonfanboy: that would be fun
 jacek: gib me new cpu
 Passifi: I wonder: how do you unlock certificates?
 Mr.intro: solve puzzles, do clash of code..
 rekaxem: hi
 Mr.intro: o\
 Mr.intro: o/
 AntiSquid: o-
 zhoubou: Certificates?
 Mr.intro: cerficatiions in profile
 zhoubou: Oh those are called certifications. Missed that
 MSmits: wazzap!
 MSmits: went to school for in person teaching today, one day a week
 MSmits: in the train home now
 MSmits: then racing my bike home to be home just in time to do 2 more hours of online teaching
 MSmits: weird situation
 zhoubou: Weird indeed
 mzbear: the approve puzzles, why the hell does EVERY approver have to check that the default code works for all languages? isn't this something that could be automated?
 jacek: just do the tick and be done
 mzbear: i am so not going to test every language one by one, and i refuse to tick a checkbox untruthfully
 mzbear: thus, i suppose i'm never going to approve any puzzles
 jacek: if people were honest, no puzzle would be approved
 mzbear: i think people should start being honest
 mzbear: flexibility ruins the system
 mzbear: this is such a simple thing that could be fixed in the backend, e.g. adding a requirement that the default code must output a hardcoded solution for the first test case
 Uljahn: easy fix could be making each approver to use different lang, so at least 4 languages to be covered
 DomiKo: Maybe someone knows any public tricks about Hypersonic?
 darkhorse64: write a beam search
 darkhorse64: and ignore the opponent
 DomiKo: Yeah, but nobody writes about it since 2016?
 darkhorse64: It's on my todo
 darkhorse64: list
 rekaxem: whats a beam search
 DomiKo: BFS with fixed max width
 rekaxem: oh
 darkhorse64: not only
 darkhorse64: you also do pruning
 darkhorse64: I mean, you keep the most promising paths
 DomiKo: I mean feedback from contest is so old
 DomiKo: And I know that it is outdated
 DomiKo: Most of the top codes are from 2019
 DomiKo: and there is no info&#160;:/
 DomiKo: no feedback from them?&#160;:/
 darkhorse64: Yeah but people have kept playing it after the 3rd leaked his code. Therefore, the top is much stronger. Ask MSmits for information
 DomiKo: The 3rd one is 70th right now
 DomiKo: so they are much stronger
 DomiKo: I will ask
 darkhorse64: There are lots of copypasted clones of the 3rd. Your(mine too) goal is to beat the clone wall
 RoboStac: I think the top few have done a bit more on enemy prediction than the post mortems, but I don't think there has been any massive change
 RoboStac: mines almost exactly the same as code in 2017, just with some beam search performance improvements I found during xmas rush 
 DomiKo: Hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: beam search for me too. but I dropped out of top10&#160;:(
 jacek: oO
 Mr.intro: #short
 audif90: damn im bad
 1400179: Yeah I think HS is one of the rare multis that got crazy progression after contest, the only other ones I can think is CSB and WW to a much lesser extent.
 Westicles: RIP robinhood
 jacek: hm?
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6038b09ec9c38c45b4b7ab48665c4f44bbfa">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6038b09ec9c38c45b4b7ab48665c4f44bbfa</a>
 Astrobytes: Constrated too hard.
 Westicles: He was a fine young lad with the sensitive heart of a poet
 1400179: Some low standards you've got
 jacek: the third guy approved has beautiful avatar
 esfes: hi
 esfes: what does it mean ' If the ASCII code of the character is ABC'
 esfes: the ascii code of the first letter in the first test is 84
 esfes: so how is it possible for it to be ABC?
 Westicles: ASCII codes are up to 3 digits
 esfes: up to
 esfes: but what about the codes that have only 2 digits
 Westicles: Maybe A=9994?
 esfes: what do you mean?
 Westicles: What is the only answer that makes sense?
 esfes: westicles?
 esfes: none
 esfes: A=0
 esfes: or C=0
 Westicles: Let me get my ouija board and we can ask the author
 esfes: lol
 esfes: well you approved it, thought you solved it lol
 Westicles: C=0 doesn't make sense, that would be 840
 esfes: i though about 084
 esfes: but than x is the same 
 esfes: and the y changes
 esfes: checked it and didnt find an O
 Westicles: AB=08=8, C=4
 esfes: I thought they meant a*b
 esfes: not ab
 esfes: thank you
 esfes: got it
 esfes: thanks for the help
 esfes: i think the author should rewrite the assignment because its not very clear 
 gatitos: oh someone linked that bards message challenge
 gatitos: i got that in fastest and i epicly failed it because i didnt know what i was supposed to do
 esfes: i can send the code of the challenge 
 esfes: if you want to
 esfes: The wording is not the best
 Westicles: I don't play clashes so I can't edit, but find someone with over 300 and they can make it clearer
 Westicles: Oh, somebody already did it, great
 BennySama: W
 BennySama: Whoops, sorry
 gatitos: there is like a bug /w the coding game lua interpreter
 eulerscheZahl: the interpreter or the language assist?
 gatitos: maybe im just really stupid
 gatitos: im running `print(exp, math.floor(exp) == exp)`
 gatitos: where exp = 29.0
 gatitos: it is outputting 29.0 false
 gatitos: i can provide like the full code repo 
 eulerscheZahl: comparing floats is prone to errors
 eulerscheZahl: are you sure it's exactly 29.0 and not 29.0001 or something?
 gatitos: ah good point
 gatitos: lua's __tostring might be coercing 29.00000000001 into 29
 gatitos: hmmm
 gatitos: it just said i faield a test case but got 100%
 gatitos: O_O?
 jacek: O:
 gatitos: oh on the topic highlighting not working
 gatitos: ruby's highlighter fails on statements that can be intepretted
 gatitos: a?b:c
 gatitos: things like "a"?"b":"c" i mean
 gatitos: the highlighting will make everything beyond the&#160;? go white iirc
 gatitos: or sometimes it will do something else
 gatitos: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/aTwXKSF">https://imgur.com/aTwXKSF</a>
 eulerscheZahl: report it on the bugs channel on discord or on the forum
 1400179: What's scarier than a bug? Spider?
 1400179: I think I found an australian-class spider in my search code
 eulerscheZahl: Huntsman spiders are gross
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 1400179: Affects all my experiments since uttt :scream:
 Astrobytes: I quite like spiders.
 Astrobytes: Not in my code.
 eulerscheZahl: the cook speaking here?
 Astrobytes: No, I genuinely quite like spiders. Very interesting creatures.
 BlaiseEbuth: That's fluffy.
 1400179: What about australian-class ones?
 JohnnyLuke: to prove im not a robot it made me select all boats, then forced me to select a jetski
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I don't mind them. Fk living there surrounded by 'em though :D
 Astrobytes: What's your enormous spider bug then?
 1400179: You know the exploration term of mcts
 Astrobytes: Yep
 1400179: Turns out sum of child visits is not quite parent visits
 Astrobytes: Oh dear, you've made a wrong calculation. And still won a lot.
 Astrobytes: Don't fix it :P
 eulerscheZahl: i know something worse than spiders: German car commercials<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMTjDRGwlNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMTjDRGwlNg</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: Can people edit contribution if the source code is not downloadable?
 struct: or does it only apply to public ones?
 struct: By people I mean other users
 1400179:&#160;?
 1400179: Other users can edit a multi?
 struct: Yes
 struct: ...
 1400179: Um.
 1400179: wat
 struct: euler tried to edit yavalath and managed to do it iirc
 Astrobytes: Couldn't edit Langton's though
 eulerscheZahl: langton is an old contribution
 Astrobytes: Ah right enough.
 eulerscheZahl: i have very old private drafts that i can't even delete
 BlaiseEbuth: Perhaps only euler can...
 struct: Well you can try, just download yavalath source and reupload
 struct: I was wondering if people could edit non downloadable
 struct: and remove the boss for example
 1400179: Website is so ripe for abuse it's not even funny
 eulerscheZahl: recently i thought i found a big onebut luckily I was wrong
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/runner/src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/runner/Renderer.java#L877">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/blob/master/runner/src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/runner/Renderer.java#L877</a>it's part of the SDK, so I removed it and tested some JS in the statement
 1400179: Anyway to struct's original question, I don't see why it would prevent them then
 eulerscheZahl: but it's just a duplication of what's done on the server again
 1400179: Oh boy
 struct: oh well
 struct: I uploaded amazons to a private contribution

 eulerscheZahl: built :P

 struct: Im not even sure if its worth reporting it
 Astrobytes: Most likely it comes under Very Minor . . .
 struct: we will fix if its exploited
 struct: its more suitable
 struct: sorry im a bit salty
 Astrobytes: Me too, don't worry.
 1400179: Ever since the great salt flood
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair far less than 5% of the users play community multiplayer games
 jacek: "Turns out sum of child visits is not quite parent visits" w00t?
 DomiKo: How much is 5% of users?
 1400179: 5% iodine salt
 struct: 100000 /s
 Astrobytes: 42
 struct: the survey was around 200k right?
 1400179: 200k survey answers??
 eulerscheZahl: 166k
 struct: I think so
 eulerscheZahl: totally all regular users
 struct: lol
 1400179: Well at least I can rest in peace, I was wondering if I should have botted in retrospect
 1400179: But 200k is a bit much
 jacek: botted?
 eulerscheZahl: bot for survey
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: when i saw the survey i had no idea how relevant it would be
 struct: ^
 1400179: Me neither, but at 200k margin for error is small
 Astrobytes: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure if i answered "compete" or "fun"
 eulerscheZahl: and competing is a subset of the fun part for me
 struct: I either voted fun or learn
 1400179: Then again god knows who answered that
 jacek: 5%?
 eulerscheZahl: school classes
 Astrobytes: Robin Hoods
 BlaiseEbuth: Not me
 1400179: Wait so 166k survey answers
 struct: yes
 1400179: 5 new idiots per day in chat
 1400179: And 15 regulars
 1400179: Something doesn't add up
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: most are "explorers"
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 Astrobytes: Explore once and then can't find their way back here?
 struct: A true explorer
 1400179: Then again I still have no idea how we have so many discord users so what do I know
 1400179: Targeted audience of lurkers
 Astrobytes: People see discord and click
 Astrobytes: (a certain subset of people)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still on the codeforces discord and have it muted
 BlaiseEbuth: Keep salting guys, I almost hear the seagulls...
 jacek: and get disappointed because its not mlp
 Astrobytes: The difference in subscriber count vs active participants is... not small 
 1400179: It's always low but that low is a bit of a novelty to me
 Astrobytes: 2021: The Salting
 1400179: 2.5k online in discord, you wouldn't effing know
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 eulerscheZahl: someone even decided it hide offline users
 1400179: I think it does that by itself when there's too many actually
 eulerscheZahl: 15k members in total
 1400179: Here's what Discord has to say about our server
 1400179: "Your server needs more members who visit and talk weekly"
 1400179: "Your retention is too low. Try improving your new member onboarding experience"
 pb4: "5 new idiots per day in chatAnd 15 regulars"
 pb4: I'm not a regular
 pb4: so am I an idiot&#160;? :D
 eulerscheZahl: we need more custom emojis on discord
 1400179: If you are, not a new one at least
 pb4: (hello)
 Astrobytes: That logic!
 BlaiseEbuth: We need a salt emoji here
 Astrobytes: I said that a long time ago Blaise
 eulerscheZahl: :salt:
 BlaiseEbuth: Me too, but nobody add it...
 kovi: pb?4 is surely with 5%
 kovi: within
 pb4: I'm surprised that I'm having fun with the Sopra challenge
 Astrobytes: It's more fun than the original codebusters?
 1400179: I'm surprised you're doing it at all
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too reasonable for Sopra, I try the topcoder marathon
 1400179: Where is the leaderboard anyway
 pb4: reCurse&#160;: so am I actually&#160;!

 1400179: If I knew you were doing it maybe I would have been tempted :p
 1400179: Still need my revenge
 Astrobytes: TC marathon started eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: 6 days remaining
 Astrobytes: What is it?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/793155215276113971/804062670709850132/downloadDocument.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/793155215276113971/804062670709850132/downloadDocument.png</a>
 pb4: What's really refreshing is that I'm regularly finding measurable improvements 
 eulerscheZahl: swap any 2 tiles
 struct: candy rush?
 Astrobytes: Oh bejeweled kinda thing
 eulerscheZahl: then if there is 3 in a line (not diagonally) it disappears
 Astrobytes: Not diagonally? Weird
 eulerscheZahl: points for long lines and long lasting combos
 pb4: Contrary to FC and OOC, where 95% of changes I didn't really know if they help
 1400179: Hmm
 eulerscheZahl: line: (length-2)^2
 1400179: Any idea why?
 pb4: In this game&#160;: 95% of changes *do help* 
 eulerscheZahl: sum of line scores multiplied by combo count
 Astrobytes: Sounds reasonably interesting. Might take a look at it.
 eulerscheZahl: you are still far from the end of the contest pb4
 pb4: reCurse you still have a few days to take your revenge&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: usually that's about the time when I run out of ideas
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: I have run out of ideas already
 pb4: Won't spend time grinding this one though
 eulerscheZahl: then try Triangle Catch&#160;;)
 1400179: Nah that's starting too late
 1400179: And if you're not tryharding it's not worth it either&#160;;)
 pb4: No good idea, no time spent
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: I really should, it looks cool
 eulerscheZahl: leaderboard for CB is almost exclusively FrenchI guess without prizes as an extra motivation, many discarded the idea
 pb4: I didn't think it would play such a big role, but I find it hard to muster the motivation when there is no real time limit
 eulerscheZahl: (or job opportunity)
 eulerscheZahl: i totally agree. I need a fixed deadline
 1400179: And focused attention
 pb4: Just knowing that it doesn't make a difference if I start today or tomorrow doesn't help starting&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: a real one, not the bitrunner fake contest
 pb4: Yes
 pb4: Well we did what we could for BR
 Astrobytes: Salt wave incoming
 1400179: That wasn't a diss on BR really
 1400179: But we all know
 eulerscheZahl: if CG doesn't want contests, we can't really do anything about itbuilding our own platform is not an option
 jacek: build your own platform. with blackjack and hookers
 1400179: fwiw I still enjoyed BR
 eulerscheZahl: i still haven't started&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Me too, even though I didn't do particularly well. Great game.
 1400179: pb4's bosses were quite fun
 pb4: Thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: The hard bosses really make it.
 eulerscheZahl: i still have a backup to read later
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I think it was a good game, better than some of CG official ones
 eulerscheZahl: procrastination at its finest
 eulerscheZahl: and no changes at all after release, were there?
 1400179: Just would have been better with the CG attention magic
 Astrobytes: Yeah, for sure
 eulerscheZahl: for CG contests it's standard. bug fixes and each extra inputs like dead pacmen
 Astrobytes: Don't think so euler
 Astrobytes: (changes after release)
 pb4: Nope, no changes
 pb4: We had reserved the possibility to do so during the first few days of the fake-contest
 1400179: Let me know next time you tryhard on something pb4
 pb4: But apparently testing had been thourough enough&#160;:)
 pb4: Haha reCurse :D
 pb4: Will od
 pb4: do*
 1400179: Next best thing after a contest
 HiRadical: lol this is why I hate writing c# code.
 jacek: oO
 HiRadical: I do a problem with 72 chars in python meanwhile someone has like 30000000 lines of code in c++ or something
 jacek: on shortest mode?
 eulerscheZahl: don't use a hammer for a screw
 Astrobytes: Where's the "Use the right tool for the job" autoresponder
 Astrobytes: Way too much of this exact complaint recently.
 Astrobytes: For my liking.
 Astrobytes:  /salt
 1400179: So what does that have to do with c# and what's the problem?
 eulerscheZahl: C# and codegolf
 1400179: Yeah but he said he's doing it in python
 1400179: And something about gigabytes of c++ code
 eulerscheZahl: my bad, selective reading when I sense a clasher
 Astrobytes: Soon, every clash will declare everyone in 1st place.
 1400179:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: People who don't use ruby/python/perl get real hurt about losing shortest mode.
 Astrobytes: Complaints everywhere.
 Astrobytes: The solution therefore is to declare them all as winners, to keep it Fun.
 eulerscheZahl: should we get rid of clash? it makes some people lose which is sad
 eulerscheZahl: they might get frustrated and never come back
 1400179: Tempting to start trolling
 1400179: Like start forum threads about using character multiplier for different languages
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: same troll on #fr :D
 1400179: C# should be 0.4
 1400179: Java 0.01
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I dont understand why peolpe take coc seriously
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but hate 'competing'...
 eulerscheZahl: in Germany we have "Bundesjugendspiele" (kids running, throwing a ball as far as they can, long jump, ...)
 Astrobytes: (Sports Day)
 eulerscheZahl: and one kid came home crying as it performed poorly. logical reaction from the mother: make a petition to stop that event
 eulerscheZahl: got a surprisingly high attention and number of signs
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder how these kids grow up and perform in the real world after school
 Astrobytes: We had the same issue with Sports Day even when I was at primary school. Nowadays everyone gets a certificate of participation so they don't feel like they lost.
 Astrobytes: Yes, your last point there euler. Exactly.
 1400179: The real world adapts to them
 eulerscheZahl: so that's why we have less contests now? and noob friendly contests
 1400179: It's much broader than that
 1400179: Maybe it's just me but I'm tempted to bury the hatchet, topic got old and salt is out of control
 1400179: It is what it is to quote a stable genius
 eulerscheZahl: i accepted defeat already
 Astrobytes: "stable genius" heh heh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the saltiness will surely be overtaken by a rush of syrupy-sweetness given time.
 struct: Save the saltiness to when the new feature is released
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: what will it be? the twitter post thing?
 struct: No idea when, and ys
 struct: yeS*
 1400179: Let's just move on
 Salted: Can we just know which clash we're going for? It's like signing up to play a sports game and no knowing which sport you're signing up for. Maybe it'll be hockey, tennis. Personally I would rather just pick the game I want to play in coc. 
 struct: private clashes allow you to choose
 struct: But its not that usefull if you dont have people to join
 1400179: The player pool is not big enough to afford fracturing the matchmaking
 eulerscheZahl: easy fix: if it's a shortest one, you close the tab and start a new one
 eulerscheZahl: reverse? close and start new
 eulerscheZahl: fastest? also close and start new
 1400179: Doesn't that tank your rating?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Salted: How do you know which one it'll be?
 struct: Just submit 1 char with 0%
 eulerscheZahl: you see it when it started
 struct: sometimes its enough for top 50%
 Salted: Oh you have to wait. That's lame. 
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert comment here&gt;
 [Kian-carling]: ok
 Salted: &lt;insert rebuttal&gt;
 TBali: there are close to 500 solo puzzles - no competition, no time pressure, no (too much) language disadvantage
 Astrobytes: ^
 TBali: and in general more interesting problems
 Salted: But no adrenaline rush either
 Salted: The clashes are actually kind of addicting
 1400179: Eh, now that's an interesting idea
 1400179: Puzzle rush like in chess
 Wings_of_Safety: You know it would make sense not to compare languages that are inherently shorter to code in with more verbose languages. Should have different categories of code like in boxing; lightweight to heavyweight. Or, you know, just have each language as a competition category.
 TBali: My max was 20 puzzles in a day
 struct: new puzzle rush on lichess is pretty good
 TBali: But unrepeatable now for me, remaining stuff is hard
 struct: starts very easy but its good
 1400179: Yeah, that would probably give a better alternative to clashes
 Kr3sZ: guys, what's the statement if the input is 3 and 5, and the output is 5 6 7 \n 6 7 8 \n 7 8 9&#160;? i can't get it
 TBali: That could be a nice contest-like event
 1400179: You could even do like the fancy ones where the puzzle gets a rating
 TBali: But that would need withhelding few dozen puzzles (to reveal them at the same time)
 TBali: I like this idea
 TBali: Pikaptcha was somewhat similar
 struct: for(i=5;i&lt;5+3;++i)s=""for(j=0;j&lt;3;++j)s+=j+i+" "
 struct: something like taht Kr3sZ
 TBali: but tematic and 4h only
 Astrobytes: I can't stand puzzle contests. Just imo.
 SPDene: Kr3sZ looks like input: 3 5 means produce a 3x3 grid of numbers, startiong with 5 (not sure if that's what you're asking)
 1400179: The only thing I could see in favor of clashes is time pressure, this would give it a better alternative imo
 Astrobytes: Yeah I agree it would certainly be an improvement
 kovi: hmm, i thought it is possible to reach legend uttt with pure mcts...how many rollouts should i reach?
 1400179: Umm
 1400179: Was it 20k or 50
 1400179: Forgot
 struct: 20-25k
 Astrobytes: 20-25k iirc
 Salted: If it wasn't for the clashes I'd probably be on a different site or solving on my own. It really is just the rush of competition. 
 TBali: For pikaptcha was adrenaline for 4 hours 
 TBali: finished in 3:52 or so...
 DomiKo: kovi 15K is good too
 kovi: no heuristic?
 1400179: No
 DomiKo: no
 kovi: hmm...i still need to double
 eulerscheZahl: i hated pikaptchadone with the first 2 in 21min. then I didn't understand the m√∂bius task
 struct: Was site slow during pikapctha?
 eulerscheZahl: and finished after &gt;3h
 eulerscheZahl: no, that was fine
 eulerscheZahl: locam sprint was horrible
 TBali: Maybe a puzzle rush would be better with more available puzzles and not building on each other
 struct: yeah
 TBali: so you can skip the one you don'T like or stuck
 struct: No skip
 struct: People should get space maze
 struct: as first puzzle
 TBali:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: episode 2
 TBali: my fellow troll
 eulerscheZahl: the one that i never published as i can't solve it myself
 TBali: freecell can come after it
 Astrobytes: Perhaps you can WIP it euler, see if anyone can solve it
 TBali: what is the hardest puzzle in expert?
 TBali: (subjective I know)
 struct: What was the main difference in ep2?
 struct: Well Nintendo probably has the lowest success rate
 struct: But people are curious and click on it to check
 struct: so that adds up
 TBali: Yep,  in it is still C++ only...
 TBali: don't understand why, contest is over long time ago
 TBali: I found some fairly easy puzzles ion expert, and some quite hard in medium
 Astrobytes: That happened after The Great Mixing.
 eulerscheZahl: just too many states in space maze 2. and my speed improvements don't work there anymore
 TBali: another quick contest idea - you only 1 puzzle (not too hard or long) - first to pass in ALL languages wins
 k4ng0u: how many people did finish space maze (1)?
 struct: 10
 struct: im not sure I think
 TBali: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/puzzles_list.html</a>
 struct: I thought I saw that number
 TBali: stats page for solo
 k4ng0u: and this is not the hardest puzzle ever?
 k4ng0u: (on cg)
 jacek: space maze?
 eulerscheZahl: now it's freecell going by solver count
 struct: ^
 TBali: number of solutions also dpeends on since when the puzzle is there.Success&#160;% is also revealing
 Westicles: the hardest one is that stupid one where you have to print out the stupid unix directory structure
 eulerscheZahl: but those numbers are biased. much more users saw nintendo
 TBali: you can sort the list above
 eulerscheZahl: only try-harders got to see space maze
 TBali: If I see you are the author, I know it will be interesting but bloody hard
 k4ng0u: oh ok, must have missed a few messages in the feedhard puzzle harder than very hard and everything at 50XP classic CG
 eulerscheZahl: and 250xp for creators
 eulerscheZahl: no matter if clash or complex multiplayer
 TBali: Westicles, which one is that?I remember solving a dir tree printer but that was not hard
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/advanced-tree">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/advanced-tree</a>
 k4ng0u: oh well. not much of a contributor myself but this sounds not so good, especially considering the harder the puzzle is, the most effort needs to be put in the testcases (outsider view though, might be challenged)
 Astrobytes: Welcome to the CG Salt Mine&#160;:)
 TBali: advanced tree - I did not find that one particularly hard. only tedious
 eulerscheZahl: the animations are what usually takes the most time
 eulerscheZahl: and testing corner cases for multiplayer games to make sure nothing breaks
 TBali: 300 loc for me
 Westicles: Oh, yeah I meant tedious... hard to finish
 TBali: But my style is verbose
 TBali: from medium, mars lander 2 is the hardest imho
 MSmits: i second thaty
 TBali: (except the 3 I still have left)
 MSmits: I spent two days on that when i had just joined CG
 Westicles: this nurikabe one is fun, but I doubt it will end up being very hard
 TBali: 1 of course from eauler...&#160;:-)
 MSmits: and then after that i tried skynet 2 and solved it in 15 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: i even solved marslander 3 before 2
 eulerscheZahl: my random search always failed 1 testcase when i tuned for the other
 MSmits: yeah i guess when doing marslander 3, you use an actual search, that you can then also use on marslander 2
 eulerscheZahl: then i wrote a few if statements and passed
 MSmits: but marslander 2 is medium, so who is going to use GA on a medium puzzle...
 eulerscheZahl: and added the random search to improve my solution from there
 MSmits: yeah mine was fully heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: how needs GA when there is MC?
 MSmits: well it's a search anyways&#160;:)
 MSmits: also, your MC are usually pretty smart
 TBali: from expert Hitori is at most medium
 TBali: simple backtrack
 eulerscheZahl: then i checked solutions and included 2 more heuristics from those and just test all 3 combined with my random search
 eulerscheZahl: find path with heuristic. then random step or 2. from there heuristic again to finish the landing. check if better
 struct: I cant stay on the same puzzle for more than 1 hour
 struct: adhd
 TBali: "but marslander 2 is medium, so who is going to use GA on a medium puzzle..."
 TBali:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you mean Onboarding
 TBali: the one with NN
 TBali: don't remember
 TBali: Right, onboarding it is.I found it because of the huge amount of upvotes (well deserved)
 TBali: But the NN was trained offline, weights are hardcoded
 TBali: This might be another idea for "beaty contest" - maybe for tech.io - publish the weirdest wolutions possible
 TBali: Reminds me to the Niels Bohr barometer anecdote
 TBali: (And we are coming back to the "right tool for the right task topic")

 jacek: and this reminds me of tom &amp; jerry
 TBali: maybe an anti-golf contest?
 TBali: longest code, BUT all lines must have a purpose in the solution
 TBali: (hard to judge automatically, I am afraid)
 TBali: let me check - my longest puzzle solution is last crusade 2
 TBali: at 22 kB
 TBali: my shortest is google interview
 TBali: ungolfed 163 bytes - but that includes the puzzle link in a comment
 TBali: my contest/bot codes are longer
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at least coc works better for me with the new web layout on cg
 struct: you get the new layout?
 struct: for me its 50/50
 TBali: my browser reverted to the old upper bar. on mobile it is the new one
 TBali: But why is it better? I thought only the menu bar changed
 TBali: IDE is the same no?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, CG has a different understanding of A/B testing
 MaxiLaw: Who needs a game made for them?
 JLukeSkywalker: you can make my game
 JLukeSkywalker: I just havnt bc I hate graphics
 eulerscheZahl: add walls and power-ups already
 MaxiLaw: Alrighty!
 JLukeSkywalker: GRAPHICS
 JLukeSkywalker: REEEE
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to collect ammo
 eulerscheZahl: and heal
 MaxiLaw: Alrighty!
 TBali: Don't forget fog of war
 MaxiLaw: So like a First Person Shooter Game?
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps TBali around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: ammo/shields/speed boost
 TBali: FPS but with a text parser input
 MaxiLaw: Alright.
 TBali: interactive fiction style

 TBali: By the way CG should support Inform 6
 MaxiLaw: $5.00 = 1 Week Delivery at Minimum Free = 1 Month at the least.
 MaxiLaw: I suppose you want free? 
 eulerscheZahl: take your time, a good game can take a month
 MaxiLaw: True.
 MaxiLaw: I'm a nice guy so I'm gonna make it as good as possible.
 Astrobytes: struct: Not sure about mixing the sides like that
 Astrobytes: black/white adjacent
 Astrobytes: Not sure
 JLukeSkywalker: currently have next leagues for tanks with shield and variable bullet size, working on adding the walls
 MaxiLaw: Alright.
 TBali: can we pay with CP?:
 MaxiLaw: So you want: 
 struct: port doom
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if variable bullets add anything to the game
 MaxiLaw: TBali its free!
 eulerscheZahl: best case there is a clear best bullet and everyone is using it
 eulerscheZahl: worst case some rock paper scissors
 MaxiLaw: Multiplayer or robot shooting?
 JLukeSkywalker: they cost your energy to fire, deals more dmg and goes slower
 MaxiLaw: I think Muiltplayer.
 Astrobytes: Ammo, shields, speed, health, that kinda thing
 struct: 3d
 MaxiLaw: Alright.
 TBali: Okay, I see it is free, but at least add in game micro-transactions
 struct: Surround sound
 MaxiLaw: Email me at: rbgamerbambammommy84@gmail.com so when I get home I can start making your game.

 Astrobytes: OK I'm commenting to JLukeSkywalker btw
 jacek: struct ask MSmits to find balanced starting positions :v
 TBali: I can provide better suggestions without context
 eulerscheZahl: coming up with a game idea is the hardest IMO
 JLukeSkywalker: i have the ideas, just too lazy
 MaxiLaw: If you want a game just email me at: rbgamerbambammommy84@gmail.com the best details you can give me.
 JLukeSkywalker: after i finish tanks, next one is stock market
 struct: I could force only one unit per player on each 4x4 board
 TBali: I am wondering if Diplomacy can be implemented
 Astrobytes: We'll beat that out of - I mean motivate you JLukeSkywalker
 Astrobytes: :P
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 TBali: But there offline negotiations are the key aspect
 MaxiLaw: I am only in charge of game making and multiplayer services. You are responsible for everything else.
 1400179: What the hell did I just read
 struct: Which part?
 1400179: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: the email address?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the yes meme
 MaxiLaw: rbgamerbambammommy84@gmail.com
 TBali: added to spam bots - tick
 eulerscheZahl: be careful sharing your email address
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://mailbait.info/">https://mailbait.info/</a>
 MaxiLaw: Its fine.
 Astrobytes: struct: that could work yeah
 jacek: AutomatonNN will you spam
 MaxiLaw: I get spam all the time.
 AutomatonNN: Hi, I should have to look into that I have to add a ref solution 
 MaxiLaw: I just programmed something to prevent it.
 MaxiLaw: It doesn't work the best.
 Astrobytes: struct: Gonna have to experiment a bit initially 
 struct: yeah
 1400179: Where is the check everything button when you need it
 MaxiLaw: But yea I will start working on it when I get home@
 eulerscheZahl: you want to approve a contribution reCurse?
 eulerscheZahl: there are lots of checkmarks
 1400179: Nah if clashers can do it I can manage
 1400179: But that website you linked
 1400179: That's a lot of checkboxes
 Astrobytes: :D
 JLukeSkywalker: are there even any puzzles on here that use trend-following and other stock prediction algorithms yet?
 1400179: If you mean puzzles with no practical real-life use oh boy have we got those

 eulerscheZahl: riddles.io had a crypto trader optim
 eulerscheZahl: the internet had riddles.io
 MSmits: jacek if there was any point to using meta mcts to help out struct I would. But I would both need a reasonably strong bot which I have no idea how to write and then some way to deal with the branching, or a million hours of computer time
 jacek: youll manage. i believe in you
 MSmits: thanks :P
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you have the money to rent some servers
 TBali: This would make a great AI game  (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)</a>
 jacek: you dont need good bot. only mcts with enough rollouts
 MSmits: technically i can afford some, but I would never get wife-approval :P
 1400179: I have the algo you just need to provide infinity
 eulerscheZahl: buy google
 eulerscheZahl: i think i don't have to read the article to say "hell no"
 TBali: which article?
 MSmits: that seems like a uniquely human game
 eulerscheZahl: diplomacy
 TBali: I played it play bay email long time ago
 TBali: it lasted 4 months
 Astrobytes: Yes. Risk might work
 TBali: Risk has random
 MSmits: you mean platinum rift 
 TBali: Diplomacy is deterministic
 TBali: much better
 piggymann23_funnergame25: yoo
 Astrobytes: Yes but requires... Diplomacy
 TBali: yes - that is the hard part
 TBali: writing natural language emails to other bots
 TBali: and understanding the incoming ones
 Astrobytes: Off you go then, this is your project for the year. In PHP.
 MSmits: this makes me wonder, has there ever been evidence of players cooperating illegally?
 MSmits: i know it happened in halite
 TBali: the game mechanic is very simple
 TBali: and teher is no META
 TBali: just subterfuge
 JLukeSkywalker: might be easier to make the game coup, still some cool strategy and subterfuge
 Astrobytes: I thought Halite had communication features?
 TBali: Actually no trolling was intended, Diplomacy could ba made with a simplified diplomacy API
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm starting to understand why people ask for reviews on their contributions on the chat or the forum...&#160;:(
 TBali: make contact, make alliance
 TBali: etc
 TBali: agree on attacking X
 MSmits: i mean two players identifying eachother in a game and then avoiding harming eachother
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I thought that was part of it
 MSmits: i think reCurse said something like that happened in halite
 MSmits: i dont think that was supposed to happen
 kovi: in 4 player game?
 MSmits: yeah
 kovi: which halite
 1400179: H2
 1400179: Can't remember if it was done in H3...
 1400179: I know it was discussed
 kovi: i cactually i learned enemy aggression in h3
 Astrobytes: It was legal?
 1400179: Nothing forbid it
 JLukeSkywalker: someone just write an ai that reads in a game rule-book and spits out a codingame game
 Astrobytes: Legal then.
 1400179: Thankfully they run tens of thousands of games for finals
 kovi: so i guess it would not be hard to learn patterns
 MSmits: obviously not intended behavior though
 1400179: I was able to measure the impact on rankings
 1400179: It had none
 1400179: But could have
 kovi: well...anyone could still say...they dont want to mess with recurse and instead focus on easier opponents
 MSmits: i guess you can do it when your output is sufficiently varied and you can output an id early in the game
 MSmits: like if you output a float
 1400179: It was continuous space so quite trivial
 MSmits: ah right
 kovi: i think in h3 someone trained his nn on recurse
 1400179: Yeah
 1400179: Supervised learning
 MSmits: was it better than you?
 1400179: No
 Astrobytes: lol, how did that work out?
 MSmits: ah good
 1400179: Much better than it should have actually
 1400179: I was also the only bot that was very learnable apparently
 1400179: Namely failed on teccles
 kovi: he said that in post mortem
 MSmits: ahh, teccles should just be  aheuristic like in uttt :P
 Astrobytes: Been a while since I read all the halite pms
 1400179: I didn't know anything about NNs back then, should read his again
 MSmits: so basically, he just read the gamestate got an output from his NN and backpropagated a score based on how similar the orders were to your bot's 
 MSmits: thats my guess about how supervised would work
 1400179: Yeah except the game features hundreds of agents so he must have had to hack something
 MSmits: yeah that seems hard
 1400179: Oh yeah I think I remember why it worked much better on mine than others
 1400179: I had no adaptive collision detection &gt;:(
 MSmits: seems easier to just write your own bot tbh. 
 1400179: Depends on your goal
 1400179: He has done the most impressive one imo
 MSmits: because he did something that is hard to do?
 Stilgart: h3&#160;?
 piggymann23_funnergame25: :grin:
 1400179: Hard to do and with much more generalized uses
 MSmits: I see
 1400179: One of the main goals was to promote machine learning
 1400179: He may be the only one who did that and made it work
 1400179: Keyword: and
 kovi: i agree. and it is not simple, i read it few monthes ago when i got some (minimal) nn understanding and there are interesting parts
 MSmits: hey, i know you're nr 1 in pr-2, but would it not be a good goal for you to try a NN there, new challenge?
 1400179: Implying I don't currently have a challenge with easier parts
 Astrobytes: Fixed the bug now?
 1400179: Yeah the fix was easy
 jacek: what bug
 1400179: sum of child visits&#160;!= parent visits
 jacek: :O
 Astrobytes: Yeah easy fix, you're retraining now?
 1400179: Yeah
 jacek: how come
 1400179: Off by one error with catastrophic implications
 MSmits: transpositions?
 MSmits: oh 
 jacek: log(0)
 1400179: I'd have to describe everything I do to properly convey how bad it was
 1400179: So you'll have to take my word for it
 jacek: what gamre
 1400179: uttt, bt, othello, checkers...
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: Comparing to 3.6 roentgen/hour it was on the terrible side of not great.
 MSmits: that's pretty bad
 Astrobytes: Seemed appropriate&#160;:)
 1400179: I don't get it
 Astrobytes: REM values. Also Chernobyl reference.
 1400179: Hmm
 Astrobytes: "3.6 roentgens per hour? Well, not great, not terrible"
 MSmits: ah 3,6 roentgen is actually not that much
 MSmits: i never use that unit
 Astrobytes: No, it's not great, not terrible either.
 MSmits: yeah that's actually accurate, i thought it was some kind of understatement
 Astrobytes: I never used it much either apart from a few exams.
 Astrobytes: Well, the meters only went up to 3.6 roentgens....
 MSmits: well if you have to stand in that radiation all day it's a problem yeah
 MSmits: with no protection
 MSmits: I have to teach this stuff in a few weeks
 MSmits: we use Sv unit for equivalent dose
 Astrobytes: The point was that there was a lot more than 3.6 roentgens coming from the open core.
 struct: MSmits the amazons will probably be 8x8 and have random starting positions, suggested by trictrac
 MSmits: makes sense, if it topped the meters...
 struct: random mirrored
 MSmits: struct can't hurt to be safe
 MSmits: as long as they are balanced
 MSmits: we dont want another bandas
 Astrobytes: It blew the meters with higher limits too.
 MSmits: you said mirrored, thats probably ok
 1400179: lol bandas
 1400179: I tried it for fun
 1400179: Biggest regret of my life after uttt
 struct: lol
 1400179: How did this get approved
 1400179: No don't tell me
 MSmits: ahh you place too much emphasis on leaderboard viability. Sometimes it can just be fun to code something&#160;:)
 1400179: Fun?
 1400179: What's that
 jacek: whats wrong with bandas
 MSmits: my point exactly :P
 jacek: aside its solved after few turns
 MSmits: jacek it has starts that are so unbalanced, the winner is clear when there are two good bots
 MSmits: no matter what they do
 1400179: Eval saying -0.8 on first turn
 1400179: Yeah.
 jacek: and its right?
 MSmits: yeah it's right
 MSmits: my mcts says -0.3 or so, with scores between -1 and 1 and it's very reliable
 1400179: Map gen is a joke and I don't even know if it's fixable
 MSmits: it was actually improved
 1400179:&#160;!
 MSmits: was worse at first
 MSmits: i meant before you tried it
 1400179: You can't make worse
 1400179: That's like saying there is negative abs(x)
 Astrobytes: that fireball guy should not have approved, he was a big copypaster iirc
 MSmits: - abs(x)&#160;? 
 1400179: No, x where abs(x) &lt; 0
 jacek: imaginary?
 MSmits: imaginary doesnt do that
 MSmits: thats when you square
 Astrobytes: That's not imaginary
 Astrobytes: eh, too slow again
 jacek: absolutely imaginary?
 1400179: Gotta go for fictional
 MSmits: wait, we did not count on jacek's imagination
 Astrobytes: Imaginatively absolutely fictional?
 1400179: I'm sure there's a pony that has a negative absolute
 1400179: Would reinforce my theory actually
 Astrobytes: Princess Negabsolutor
 Astrobytes: I feel dirty.
 jacek: well if you can have sqrt of negative, why not abs of negative
 jacek: im gonna look for that
 1400179: negative abs not abs of negative
 1400179: Big difference
 jacek: whatever
 MSmits: what's the meta on game of drones?
 MSmits: do people use GA?
 Angecide: found a discussion about it on math stackexchange, seems like it could exist in some obscure field
 1400179: Uh oh
 MSmits: I'm just asking because I have 3 students doing game of drones and it would be helpful if i knew the game a bit better, maybe get out of silver
 1400179: I was replying to Angecide
 1400179: I completely forgot what I did for god
 MSmits: yeha i got that
 MSmits: i wonder if it has to be approached as some kind of partial optimization problem
 MSmits: not just an adversarial bot search like we usually have
 MSmits: (on boardgames etc)
 1400179: It's definitely unique
 MSmits: I was thinking of trying SA with a solution assigning drones to a primary and secondary target
 MSmits: then doing some sims and repeating the same for opponents
 Astrobytes: Why SA in particular?
 1400179: Physics
 MSmits: cuz I like it
 MSmits: and i dont know many others
 Astrobytes: :D
 1400179: Biologists go for GA
 MSmits: that too :0
 Astrobytes: Meh, I like SA too
 MSmits: I think god might be better or just as good as csb for people who are relatively new to coding. It's so easy to get a starting bot and slowly add new things
 1400179: :thinking:
 MSmits: there's no physics and stuff, all you do is send your drones somewhere
 MSmits: big searchspace, simple actions
 kovi: isnt it about economy rather?
 1400179: If you can get past how boring it looks you might be right
 kovi: (havent played it)
 MSmits: right yeah somewhat boring i guess
 Astrobytes: Heh. Not wrong there actually.
 MSmits: kovi, no economy
 MSmits: just score from keeping captured nodes
 MSmits: like domination in a fps
 Astrobytes: Definitely has a scheduling thing going on though
 MSmits: except no shooting
 Astrobytes: iirc
 MSmits: how do you mean Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: what to send where and when
 1400179: This may be wildly off topic but
 Astrobytes: So, some part of it might be reducible to a simpler problem
 1400179: Gladiabots has something very good about teaching "coding" within a "bot game"
 1400179: Execution is a bit off imo but the underlying idea is pretty good
 Astrobytes: That name tho
 MSmits: that's not off topic at all, always nice to check those things out
 MSmits: ohh a steam game
 1400179: And behavior trees have a major relevance when it comes to game AI
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: you see a lot of that in those turnbased and real time strategy games
 MSmits: saw some edited behavior files for some of those
 1400179: I'm no teacher but I'm sure there's some gold to be found there
 MSmits: if there is, it's probably going to be for those really strong students that are already far along. Most of my students can barely code
 MSmits: that's the difficult part with AI
 1400179: Yeah but you don't need to code to do behavior trees
 jacek: just wait for AI to code for you
 MSmits: oh I see
 Astrobytes: You can do them on a whiteboard
 1400179: Yet it teaches similar principles
 MSmits: I'll check it out
 1400179: In a context that might be more appealing to some
 jacek: AutomatonNN can do them as well
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to understand the internet
 1400179: I know I didn't give a damn about geometry until I learned it could be used in video games
 jacek: no one understands the internet
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's always great to show applied examples of what you're learning
 Astrobytes: Varied examples at that
 TBali: multiplying huge matrices became fancy only with the advent of ML...
 MSmits: reCurse yeah I got a lot more interested in linear algebra when i was building custom weaponry in space engineers and scripting them to hit spaceships moving at a constant velocity&#160;:)
 TBali: same with graph theory and CG
 MSmits: yeah
 1400179: While we're into these recommendations, if you want to get bitten by parallelism problems in a gamey way, spacechem is fantastic
 Astrobytes: I love all the zachtronics games tbh
 1400179: True
 TBali: I bought only one  (actually because Astrobytes recommended) - I don'T dare to buy the rest, I am afraid of the lost time
 TBali: I mean time to be lost
 1400179: Is it lost if you have fun
 Astrobytes: Whilst keeping your mind sharp
 TBali: Ask my social peers like family, friends...
 Astrobytes: Make them play it.
 TBali: Justr checking my Gog account. Actually I bought Spacechem besides TIS100 but did not install it yet
 Astrobytes: You know what to do.
 TBali: bye, be right back (in February)
 jacek: o:
 TBali: but another topic - just listening to a C++ tutorial. This unique_ptr, shared_ptr thing seems a bit complicated. Do people actually use these?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 1400179: Yes
 BlaiseEbuth: No
 TBali: that is overwhelming vote&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: It's really not complicated.
 TBali: this manual memory management seems to be tough for any code over 50 lines
 1400179:&#160;???
 TBali: I mean in general
 TBali: not the *_ptr
 1400179: What are you talking about, it's the opposite of manual
 Astrobytes: That's automatic memory management, manual memory management is * fun
 TBali: I meant C++ in general - so no CG, haveing to worry about delete
 TBali: but not finished th course yet, so even my comments  might not make sense 
 1400179: Well you lost me
 RoboStac: thats why unique / shared ptr exist so you never have to type delete again
 1400179: ^
 Astrobytes: Once it's out of scope it's done for you
 TBali: okay, next time I actually FINIS the lecture before I ask&#160;:-)
 MSmits: well there's no segmentation faults in C# :P
 MSmits: he's not wrong that there's more ways fk up in C++
 1400179: Do NPEs count?
 MSmits: nonylphenol ethoxylates&#160;?
 1400179: Exactly
 Astrobytes: I mean I'd still practice using raw pointers if you're unfamiliar but the unique/shared pointers are a real help
 TBali: but if they delete automatically isn't part of the speed advantage lost?
 TBali: is it so good?
 TBali: That is half GC, only determeniszic timing, no?
 1400179: Don't take offense
 1400179: But there's so many things wrong in that question I'm not sure what to say
 1400179: What performance are you talking about?
 1400179: And it's not garbage collection because it still needs to be explicitly freed
 1400179: It's just done automatically via the destructor
 1400179: What is allocated needs to be freed regardless
 MaxiLaw: I didn't get a email for the game that someone wants made, I am home.
 TBali: okay, thanks. 
 RoboStac: yeah, either you free the memory before the pointer goes out of scope or you leak the memory and lose it forever
 RoboStac: I mean I guess it's technically faster to leak until you run out of memory
 Astrobytes: lol
 1400179: That's true, it's also led to the invention of GC
 TBali: Actually in PHP with some puzzles I start with "disable_gc()"
 MSmits: I played a lot of games where players were complaining about memory leaks happening in extended play
 MSmits: before i could even code
 TBali: if I am not out of memory till I solve it I am much  faster
 1400179: What if I could leak until I run out of memory and then let someone else free the memory for me
 struct: you can disable gc on php?
 TBali: yes
 MaxiLaw: For the person that wanted a FPS game made I never got a email on complete details? I am home so I can work on it now if you send me a email.
 TBali: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gc-disable.php">https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.gc-disable.php</a>
 TBali: otherwise I am dead lost with objects in 100 ms turn time
 MSmits:  "Deactivates the circular reference collector"
 JohnnyLuke: lol, is maxi trying to scam on a site of programmers?
 MSmits: circular reference collector seems way more specific than GC?
 1400179: The leak everything strategy rarely applies outside of CG
 1400179: Well GC solves the circular ref problem
 MSmits: but doesnt it solve more than that?
 1400179: But when it comes to PHP I would assume the least possible except it's probably not doing what it says
 RoboStac: php is reference counted so things do get collected as they go out of scope unless they have circular references
 MSmits: ah ok
 1400179: So they kind of have both at the same time? Sounds like PHP
 MSmits: circular reference means 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;1 right?
 MSmits: so it seems everything is still in use
 TBali: CG in PHP is implemented with counting circular references 
 1400179: Or more simply, 1-&gt;2 2-&gt;1
 MSmits: also 1 -&gt; 1&#160;?
 1400179: Hmm
 1400179: I would say yes?
 RoboStac: I'd imagine so
 MSmits: hmm but what if it's a really large circular reference and you're actually using it? Or is that not possible?
 TBali: This is how it works in PHP <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.gc.php">https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.gc.php</a>
 1400179: Then it won't get GC
 TBali: might be different from Java
 MSmits: ah ok
 1400179: GC only collects what cannot be referenced
 1400179: From a root
 MSmits: got it
 jacek: could be a nice puzzle, to program GC behavior
 MSmits: I guess I also understand now why gc can be so expensive
 MSmits: it's BFS/DFS-ing everything in memory
 MSmits: or floodfilling i guess
 MSmits: better name for it
 1400179: Btw it's not the only way to solve the circular ref problem
 1400179: Weak refs are another way
 TBali: Appeared in PHP 7.4 and more of it in PHP 8 just recently
 MSmits: what's a weak ref?
 TBali: never used it though
 Astrobytes: doesn't increase the ref count for one thing
 Astrobytes: but you can still hold the reference
 MSmits: oh it's a low priority ref that leads to gc removing it if there is no other connection?
 TBali: Weak references allow the programmer to retain a reference to an object which does not prevent the object from being destroyed. They are useful for implementing cache like structures.
 TBali: "was a quote"
 1400179: Doesn't have to be GC related
 1400179: Concept exists in C++ as well
 MSmits: ah ok, got it
 1400179: Node and children
 1400179: If parent and child are strong ref, you can't free the tree
 1400179: If parent is weak ref, all is good
 MSmits: mmh I just do parentIndex  = 0 on my giant node cache :P
 MSmits: I'm so horrible at c++
 MSmits: I dont leak memory though
 MSmits: i just claim it all in a giant object pool 
 1400179: That's a very legitimate allocation strategy
 1400179: Maybe the oldest one
 MSmits: yeah it's funny how windows will still just use your claimed memory
 MSmits: I claim 1 gb and it will only show 200 mb in memory
 1400179: There's a lot to say about that
 1400179: Not sure it's worth it though
 MSmits: dont bother, i sort of half know enough about it 
 MSmits: i just think it's funny it works that
 MSmits: way
 MSmits: they had to work this out or programs would claim too much memory and not use it
 MSmits: i guess
 1400179: Let's just say it falls apart when you want your computer to do more than one thing
 MSmits: sure, it works under the assumption you dont run out
 Astrobytes: Anit-threading
 Astrobytes: *Anti
 TBali: Airline overbooking works the same not?
 MSmits: yeah sounds similar TBali
 MSmits: that would really piss me off
 1400179: That's a creative analogy
 TBali: Just do not appear all the ticket holders at the airport...
 MSmits: or people taking all their savings out of the bank at once :0
 TBali: even better analogy
 JLukeSkywalker: finally hit lvl 20
 TBali: I have friends working at bank branch office. Elderly custromer came in, "please show me my money" I don't wnat to take it out just show me that you have it
 Astrobytes: So violent. What did lvl 20 ever do to you? 
 TBali: Beware lvl 20 fighters can hit back
 TBali: or mages trun you to frog
 JLukeSkywalker: it never called me back
 TBali: But we do like frogs here at CG
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's your game cat v frog v dog, frogs have waterguns, cats have claws, and dogs have teeth
 1400179: waterguns?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cats and dogs usually don't like getting sprayed
 Astrobytes: Frogs should have venom or very sticky tongues.
 Astrobytes: Regardless, it's RPS/
 Astrobytes: *RPS.
 struct: it will get aproved anyways dont worry
 1400179: Well no, frog is obviously OP
 TBali: Are there other language where tongue and language is the same word?
 1400179: FR
 TBali: HU as well
 struct: PT-PT
 Astrobytes: Depends if it's actually poisonous or not
 TBali: why PT-PT? BR-PT not?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: trying to get 50 clashes, boring
 Astrobytes: Yes, you can say tongue and language interchangeably in English too
 1400179:&#160;??
 struct: br-pt should be too
 TBali: poll: what is your favourite coding tongue?
 TBali: sounds weird
 1400179: Please stop sticking out your language at me
 Astrobytes: No, doesn't work like that.
 ryantimjohn: but mother tongue does
 struct: thats 2 words
 1400179: Sure but same word means both ways
 Astrobytes: In the context of speaking about language I should have said, my bad.
 Astrobytes: As always, context is everything.
 TBali: in context free grammars not
 TBali: there was a puzzle
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah
 TBali: and I remember √≠Chomsky from the university
 TBali: was a quite weird  course
 TBali: don't remember anything
 TBali: just the guy's name
 Astrobytes: Noam Chomsky is a fairly well known guy
 owent3877: hi
 TBali: yeah, and not a computer only
 owent3877: I'm new here
 owent3877: like, two minits ogo
 Astrobytes: Indeed. Much of his great work is outside the field of linguistics alone
 TBali: but I met with his work only in the context of this semester course dealing with artificial grammars
 owent3877: hello?
 Mr.intro: hello @owent
 Astrobytes: TBali: It's a tough subject (for me at least)
 Astrobytes: Hi new here
 TBali: at that time it sounded very theorethic. Maybe good if you plan to write a parser for a compiler.
 TBali: Not sure if it is used in NLP?
 jacek: or html parser
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/3122936">https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/3122936</a>
 TBali: or NLP went completely the deep neural networks way
 jacek: Nay Little Pony?
 TBali: yes that one
 TBali:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol at your link jacek
 TBali: regex was quite a mystery for me, I mean how can it be so fast,
 TBali: Then I learned about KMP
 TBali: last summer (did not know about this before)
 TBali: But maybe regex is not using KMP
 Astrobytes: regex matches patterns
 TBali: yes, the deterministic state automatons can be extended also for patterns not just exact strings
 TBali: my shallow knowledge on the topic comes from this course <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithms-part2/knuth-morris-pratt-TAtDr">https://www.coursera.org/lecture/algorithms-part2/knuth-morris-pratt-TAtDr</a>
 Astrobytes: Hm. My knowledge isn't great either but I know that it's Yet Another Case of right tool, right job.
 TBali: there was even a YACC  in unix
 TBali: Yer Another Compiler Compiler
 TBali: implemented exactly the Chomsky parsing topic we discussed
 Astrobytes: (hence my Y A C  capitalisations)
 jacek: yacek?
 TBali:&#160;:)
 TBali: Yet Another Coder Emitting Kode
 TBali: okay, not the best one
 TBali: With regexp as a (hobby) coder, my problem is that I don't use it on a weekly basis, so by the next time I need it, I always forget the syntax
 TBali: Had to look up dozens of time already
 TBali: I don't like code syntax not self-describing
 Astrobytes: Yet Another Computationally Expensive Kill
 jacek: what a coincedence. my app for android is call ya paper soccer - ya for yet another
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if you don't use regex er, regularly, it can be a bit tricky to remember past the very basics
 Astrobytes: Nice advertising there jacek. Didn't know you'd made an app. Does it sell?
 TBali: yay = yet another yes
 jacek: its free. i released it about 5 years ago
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 jacek: it was actually my first serious ai project
 TBali: is it same as the multi?
 Astrobytes: Nice
 TBali: (which I did not try, just see it )

 TBali: cool, congrats
 TBali: this is just okay self promotion imho
 TBali: does it plays against human?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1 clash left for 50
 Astrobytes: Yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yawn
 jacek: ai and human, via wifi or bluetooth
 TBali: Patrick, 50&#160;? go for the 500 achievement
 owent3877: do you know the ansed to code vr zombies?
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: you're trying to get the achievement?
 jacek: paper soccer as paper and pencil game is pretty popular in poland' schools
 owent3877: HELLO?!?!?!?
 jacek: OHAI
 1400179: DONT SCREAM
 owent3877: hello?
 owent3877: i nead help
 struct: what is ansed?
 MSmits: did you fall down a well owent3877?
 Astrobytes: owent3877: 42.314^59266
 Astrobytes: damn, missed a digit

 MSmits: the 42 is in there, thats enough answer
 Astrobytes: What's that Skippy? Owen's fallen down the well?
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: was this a dolphin or a kangaroo
 MSmits: i forgot
 Astrobytes: Flipper is the dolphin
 MSmits: ahhh ok
 Astrobytes: Skippy's the kangaroo
 MSmits: got it
 Astrobytes: Lassie was the dog
 MSmits: keep going
 owent3877: and i thought i said answer
 TBali: jacek - I did not this one in particular. I used to play a "car race" paper-pencil game on grid. Have to go fastest through a track , where each turn you can modify your movement vector by 1 only
 MSmits: ed was the horse right?
 1400179: Let me guess, homework?
 Astrobytes: I'm all out of animals MSmits
 Astrobytes: and lol
 MSmits: you forgot ed
 Astrobytes: How could I forget Mister Ed
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: a horse is a horse is a horse
 MSmits: of course
 owent3877: do you know the answers to code vr zombies?
 Astrobytes: VR Zombies would be quite something
 owent3877: this is hard
 MSmits: it's not hard, you cant die
 MSmits: he just shoots all the zombies
 owent3877: i need the answers
 1400179: Why
 owent3877: cuz i cant do it
 Astrobytes: Learn.
 1400179: Why do you 'need' it?
 TBali: but with the answers in your hand, yu still "cant do it"
 owent3877: cuz i'm 10
 MSmits: but he has the answers TBali, he doesnt need to, then
 1400179: Ok. So why do you 'need' the answer?
 Astrobytes: oh looks like one of our trolls again
 MSmits: owent3877 you're not allowed to play zombie games, they're 12+
 MSmits: too much blood/gore
 owent3877: shigh
 MSmits: it's safe

 MSmits: you will develop mental issues
 owent3877: i play halo reach
 struct: good enough
 MSmits: not safe i mean
 1400179: Yeah we figured.
 1400179: Start by answering my question, why do you 'need' it?
 owent3877: then all do the bat man thing
 Astrobytes: I'm doing it right now 
 MSmits: you're doing the batman thing?
 Astrobytes: I'm sure everyone will join in as you asked
 TBali: this conversation gets weirder by the minute
 Astrobytes: "all do the bat man thing"
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: let me go suit up
 MSmits: reCurse, you can be Robin
 owent3877: i am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad
 Astrobytes: I'm doing the "BLAM! KAPOW! SPLAT" thing and nananana'ing around the small area of my chair seat.
 1400179: Can't tell who's the bigger troll here
 owent3877: huh?
 1400179: Can you explain what you need?
 Astrobytes: owent3877: Talk sense
 owent3877: why?
 Astrobytes: Or you get rubbish as a reply.
 MSmits: I think he just got here randomly
 1400179: You ask for something, I ask you why
 owent3877: did not
 PatrickMcGinnisII: huh, quest map isn't updating
 Astrobytes: What are you trying to do? Program? Or play a game?
 MSmits: maybe we just should stop feeding the troll and let reCurse finish his responsible moderating
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i had to click it
 owent3877: program
 Astrobytes: You think reCurse isn't feeding it MSmits?&#160;:)
 1400179: Doesn't sound like a troll, but you guys sure are
 owent3877: me?
 MSmits: maybe
 TBali: Owen, there is a forum thread with some hints

 TBali: You might start by xhecking this out
 MSmits: I guess we were assuming he was a troll, when he's actually serious
 PatrickMcGinnisII: batman thing?  Ahh, you know chicks think they are a sexy harleyquinn ... that just means they date jokers
 owent3877: owen is my real name
 Astrobytes: Sounds like most of the trolls/idiotic randoms we get throughout the day:"GIVE ME THE ANSWER"
 1400179: Sounds like a genuine 10yr old to me

 TBali: If  you find Zombies too hard try an easiwer one
 Astrobytes: Have you solved other puzzles Owen?
 MSmits: owent3877 do you know a little bit of coding? If you can't code at all it might be better to go to a learning website such as codecademy.com or others
 struct: owent3877 the easiest way to solve cvz
 MSmits: the idea is, if you're on CG, you know at least the bare minimum in language
 struct: is to move to the closest zombie
 MSmits: such as loops/conditions/input/print
 MSmits: in 1 language i mean
 owent3877: i cant moov
 TBali: move to the closest zombie almost works but not 100%
 owent3877: crap
 struct: it is 100%
 struct: I think
 1400179: 100% is moving to closest human
 struct: oh right
 MSmits: yeah that works
 owent3877: what
 Astrobytes: owent3877: which puzzles have you solved so far?
 struct: Thats what i wanted to say
 owent3877: 3
 MSmits: did you solve the descent, thor etc?
 Astrobytes: which&#160;!= how many
 owent3877: yes i salved thor
 MSmits: i suggest you keep doing  more easy puzzles
 MSmits: optim arena's are a bit harder
 owent3877: what is that?
 Astrobytes: What you're doing.
 MSmits: and those are harder
 owent3877: oh
 MSmits: than easy puzzles

 TBali: the select easy
 TBali: or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 owent3877: im doing ASCII ART
 MSmits: also our apologies for making fun of you earlier owent3877, we get players who are trolls here sometimes
 jacek: or solve puzzle of the week
 owent3877: i was trolled?
 owent3877: wow
 MSmits: no, we thought you were a troll, but it seems like you're not
 TBali: For the beginning few puzzles, what CG suggests as next is usually fine
 MSmits: so, sorry about that
 owent3877: what would i troll for?
 MSmits: good question
 Astrobytes: I always reserve judgment.
 TBali: Shoot firs, ask later
 TBali: that is my motto
 owent3877: i dont know what trolling is
 MSmits: trolling means players come here and then pretend they dont understand anything, call people names and such
 MSmits: use bad words etc.
 Astrobytes: Then how would you know  to say: "what would i troll for?"
 TBali: Check Astrobytes and myself: we are trolls
 MSmits: not really
 jacek: :unamused:
 owent3877: shure
 Astrobytes: Out-trolled you jacek. Slacking ponyboy, slacking!
 Astrobytes: owent3877: Back to the subject in hand
 struct: Should I write meta for amazons
 struct: to test?
 MSmits: struct i doubt there is a point
 owent3877: my name is owen!
 MSmits: meta mcts only works if you can get some depth in the search
 Astrobytes: Player test struct
 struct: I need a heater
 Astrobytes: owent3877: We have established this Owen.
 struct: should be enough
 MSmits: best thing you can do if you have the time is try to find from literature what are good moves and try to write a good bot
 owent3877: im in greenland
 MSmits: or wait for tric trac to do it]
 struct: I guess I need to find a good paper
 struct: there are thousands on it
 owent3877: it is cold
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: The reason I suggested Amazons for CG in the first place is because it's a highly studied game
 MSmits: it's also interesting because the usual approaches to board games won't work here
 TBali: Owen here are some of teh easy puzzles with the highest success rate: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca7406f2-9d7c-4ee2-a88c-01ce9a28a0ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ca7406f2-9d7c-4ee2-a88c-01ce9a28a0ee</a>

 Astrobytes: Exactly MSmits. Well, certain combinations of them for sure
 Astrobytes: Yes. Additional complexity.
 MSmits: owent3877, use TBali's list
 MSmits: (pinged him)
 Astrobytes: reCurse: did you see tric tracs Fireworks contribution? (basically Hanabi)

 owent3877: im doing There is no Spoon
 TBali: (I hope he is not a troll, working so much for help...&#160;:-) )
 owent3877: im not a trool
 owent3877: im mean troll
 TBali: Spoon is a good choice!
 TBali: Episode 1 I mean
 owent3877: im doing 1
 Astrobytes: owent3877: Did you finish ascii art?
 owent3877: no
 TBali: What language do you use?
 zhoubou: He's doing puzzles in bash
 Astrobytes: Well... why move on?
 owent3877: cuz i can
 TBali: That's the spirit!
 owent3877: crap
 owent3877: im a falure
 TBali: actually CG is good for practice what you already KNOW, but not the best to learn a language from scratch
 TBali: You can find tutorial of your choice for your language (whixh you did not specify, crap is not a language) and come back to CG a bit later
 MSmits: I'm not convinced of that TBali
 TBali: If you are 10 and did 3 puzzles in a real programming language, you already do great. I was 11 when I had my first code written
 MSmits: there's rockstar, brainfk, shakespeare, emoji, why not crap
 owent3877: There is no Spoon is hard
 Astrobytes: Based on the time you have spent on these puzzles, you'd find tictactoe hard to play on paper.
 owent3877: what/
 jacek: uttt?
 TBali: Msmith, I don't dare to think about the reserved words in craplang
 Astrobytes: TBali: type MSm and press tab
 TBali: MSmits
 TBali: sorry
 Astrobytes: :D
 TBali: my mistype ratio is 20% 
 MSmits: there's so many words for crap
 owent3877: good by
 TBali: and no correct in webchat
 MSmits: it would be a great language
 MSmits: bye owent3877
 TBali: bye, and don't give up coding 
 Astrobytes: Welp. We tried the educational approach, we tried the anti-troll approach, we tried reasoning, we tried directing to puzzles, we failed.
 owent3877: im going to code combat
 TBali: and not being able to correct myself after hitting enter is like unix mail
 Astrobytes: owent3877: that's probably a better idea, codingame is not good to learn your first language.
 owent3877: i havve lerned pithon
 TBali: eulers #1 spot is spared
 TBali: python is a good start
 owent3877: i know
 owent3877: brb
 owent3877: what about screeps
 owent3877: want the link?
 TBali: google helps me
 TBali: never tried this one
 BlaiseEbuth: Pay to win...
 Astrobytes: We don't want the link for screeps thank you.
 owent3877: ok
 Astrobytes: You already play screeps then owent3877?
 owent3877: no
 Astrobytes: Right.
 owent3877: i just found it
 duckymirror: In case you need anybody to discuss, I play Screeps.
 owent3877: cool!
 Astrobytes: Got put off by the JS thing, you can compile other langs now these days right?
 MSmits: go here #OfficialScreepsChannel
 TBali: With so much altruism in me I won't finish this C++ video tut today...
 Astrobytes: Statement of the year TBali
 TBali: Chat should be banned if one has other stuff to do 
 owent3877: i dont 
 MSmits: best is to go to the #OtherStuff channel and not say anything there
 TBali: only 75 mins to go.. tommorrow
 TBali: I create a LonelyTrollClub
 MSmits: that's cool
 MSmits: Is jacek moderating it?
 TBali: yes, kicks and bans me all the time
 MSmits: he does that
 TBali: I tried also /dev/nulll
 Astrobytes: TBali: "Chat should be banned if one has other stuff to do " - no, it's a question of focus.
 owent3877: what about tis-100?
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Do that.
 TBali: not juts focus, it is question of multitask. I am too old for that
 Astrobytes: How old are you again TBali?
 TBali: 10
 Astrobytes: :expressionless_face:
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 TBali: My mum told me not to reveal my age online. There are bad men 
 owent3877: same
 owent3877: im 10
 TBali: with innocent cat avatar
 TBali: Me too. And I started coding at 11
 TBali: C64 BASIC
 Astrobytes: TBali: OK you won the trolling
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah beware of the skirt-wearing men with cute cat avatars...
 TBali: I am slightly younger than C
 MSmits: So, D
 Astrobytes: B
 Astrobytes: no wait
 Astrobytes: ffs
 Astrobytes: It's late
 Astrobytes: D indeed
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: would it help if i said i also wanted to type B a split second before i said D
 Astrobytes: lexical vs chronological meh
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: :rofl:
 TBali: almost same old as Intel 8080
 TBali: but I age better&#160;:-)
 TBali: or that is how I think
 Astrobytes: Not wrong I suppose
 owent3877: im doing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.flexboxdefense.com/">http://www.flexboxdefense.com/</a>
 TBali: But my memory can be adressed in 3-4 bits
 TBali: and my max clock rate is 1 instructions per minute
 Astrobytes: Heh
 owent3877: huh?
 TBali: hah!
 TBali: (lucky there is no moderator here to kick me)
 TBali: ops, there is

 TBali: * kick
 TBali: soes not work for me mere mortal
 MYBK: Hello everybody, does anyone, knows how to approach Shadows of the Knight - Episode 2? I don't think binary search is enough to solve it... thanks  
 TBali: binary search independently by axis was almost enough for me but not completely for some tests.
 TBali: I had some trouble and tweaking and finally got it, but don't remember exactly how
 MYBK: Emm I see, thank you for your response I will try I little bit more than. :D 
 TBali: The problem is when you change from x to y, you loose extra turn 
 TBali: that was needed to be saved
 Astrobytes: TBali: type /me followed by some words
 MYBK: thanks TBali for your help&#160;:)

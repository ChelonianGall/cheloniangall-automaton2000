 TheDayIsMyEnemy: Mad
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: where is everyone:X
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: eulerscheZahl hi
 Gorbit99: probably asleep
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: I remember before there were so many people 
 Gorbit99: most people here it seems are european
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: not really .. at least before :D
 eulerscheZahl: so, where have you been?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe the others are there right now
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: here it is.. the champion 
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: eulerscheZahl when #1 lul 
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: nice :D
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: I missed so many things
 eulerscheZahl: a few months ago when CG changed the ranking formula
 eulerscheZahl: and i got a ban hammer
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile it seems we lost MadKnight
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: I got almost 2 levels from the quest map :D
 Gorbit99: oh, I remember madknight
 Gorbit99: he was the one who totally didn't show me the secret csb formula
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: he was always here before
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: spamming :D
 eulerscheZahl: he did NOT?
 Gorbit99: never, why would he even do such a thing
 eulerscheZahl: one day I changed my nickname as AutomatonNN kept pinging me
 AutomatonNN: what is the most problem with the same code?
 eulerscheZahl: MK thought I was new and sent me a private message to tell me about CSB
 Gorbit99: ðŸ˜‚
 TheDayIsMyEnemy: Hahaha
 Gorbit99: you ain't escaping
 eulerscheZahl: kept him busy for 20minthen I got bored and told him that I just promoted to legend
 Gorbit99: is there a way to just test a contribution in the ide with the testcases I create, or should I just use rextester for that?
 Gorbit99: I worded that wrong
 Gorbit99: a contribution I'm creating
 Gorbit99: that's an important part
 eulerscheZahl: simple one or interactive?
 Gorbit99: interactive
 Gorbit99: probably
 Gorbit99: basically just having the same thing as a normal puzzle would be alright
 eulerscheZahl: then you run it offline. not sure is cg shows validators now
 Gorbit99: does
 Gorbit99: it shows them until the contrib is accepted
 eulerscheZahl: then upload as private and mess around
 eulerscheZahl: or is there a misunderstanding between us?
 Allis: Are you worried that your tests are dependent upon how CG actually feeds input to the program or something?
 Gorbit99: basically I want a simple way to develop the solution
 eulerscheZahl: unrelated: beside test.html there is stub.html and statement.htmlthere existence is poorly documented so i'm telling you here
 Gorbit99: that's about it
 eulerscheZahl: there are test files like test1.json, test2.json right?
 eulerscheZahl: you can set them in the test/Main.class for offline play
 eulerscheZahl: or you upload the contribution and play on CG directly
 Gorbit99: it's just a simple in/out puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: you just said it's interactive
 Gorbit99: I didn't know what you meant 
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Gorbit99: what would interest me, is what are the differences between the individual contrib types?
 eulerscheZahl: then I think you save the contribution and just execute it. I've never done this myself
 Gorbit99: I get coc, multiplayer and optimization
 eulerscheZahl: and 3 others?
 Gorbit99: but what's the difference between solo game and in/out?
 Gorbit99: blog article I also get
 eulerscheZahl: in/out is the one you are doing. similar to clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: for the solo puzzle you upload a zip file with the game
 eulerscheZahl: that's an animated one
 eulerscheZahl: multiplayer and optim are zip files too
 Gorbit99: a
 Gorbit99: h
 eulerscheZahl: you could open a game on github (most contributions have a link to the repo), just download it as a zip and upload it on CG.
 eulerscheZahl: for the classic in/out puzzle I think you have to enter everything manually
 Gorbit99: does solo puzzle also have to be a strict "test case input -&gt; output", or can you write validator code for that?
 eulerscheZahl: strict text comparison
 Gorbit99: alright
 eulerscheZahl: very limited
 Gorbit99: yeah, that's my issue
 eulerscheZahl: you could just make it an interactive one and kill the viewer if you don't need it :D
 eulerscheZahl: or you find a nice graphical representation, i don't know the problem you are designing
 Gorbit99: it would have a nice graphical representation
 Gorbit99: I assume there's a blog post about interactive puzzles, or some wiki link
 eulerscheZahl: great, then make it interactive&#160;:)

 Gorbit99: thanks
 Gorbit99: time to brush off my java
 eulerscheZahl: and just open some games that you like and that have animations. to see how it's done there
 Gorbit99: thanks a lot
 eulerscheZahl: and ask here or on discord when you are stuck. some players have messed with the SDK already
 Gorbit99: eg you
 eulerscheZahl: yes :P
 eulerscheZahl: from my experience making/finding appealing graphics is the hardest part
 Gorbit99: gf is an artist, hopefully, if all goes well, I can just ask her nicely enough
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 aCat: morning all
 aCat: I updated samegame
 aCat: and just noticed that before update
 aCat: it warked as A*craft regarding puzzlespamming
 aCat: hx for the hint euler

 aCat: LET US DO GAMES TOGETHER&#160;!
 aCat: my ideas + your fixes, my engine + your visualization
 eulerscheZahl: sure&#160;:)
 aCat: :heart_eyes_cat:
 Gorbit99: now I want to know what else there is to see
 eulerscheZahl: but first: breakfast
 aCat: ok, have a nice time euler
 nfgCodex: i don't understand this bot battle game thing... is it really playing against other people? is it just made up gamification that i'm literally waiting for no reason? I'm just trying to make sense of what is actually happening here
 Gorbit99: if it's in compete, you're playing against people
 Gorbit99: when you submit that is
 Andy_F: there are also some bots in clash of code but they mirror actual player submissions
 Gorbit99: I assume if it's a bot battle game, it's a multiplayer game
 jrke: yeah bot programming is multiplayer game
 jacek: oh? i always thought it was just chaning strategy everytime
 eulerscheZahl: CG doesn't hold a bunch of people captive in their basement to play against you?
 Gorbit99: what's a normal turntime for solo games?
 theBatman: Are there bots in Clash of code?
 Gorbit99: yeah
 Gorbit99: like 7 of them? maybe 6
 Allis: There are eleven: AlkhilJohn, BSoD, BitWolf, JayEm94, KaneyklovAleck, LannertvSeveir, MathieuGanesan, Natchhood, NoopatJntsu, SuperMuppet, Tychkorg
 jrke: yeah allis you are right
 zask_warrior: hello
 jacek: good morning
 jrke: where is struct gone?
 jacek: he became class
 jrke: :smiley:
 jrke: next time he will be header file
 eulerscheZahl: i miss the struct&#160;:(
 jacek: with every bullet so far
 jrke: currently he didn't changed his name
 eulerscheZahl: ghosting on discord too
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: Bruh
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: Help me
 Allis: With?
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: When i enter Coders strike Back, i dont understand the second step
 jacek: what does it say
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: To play, you'll have to write your own program... but we've entered some code for you to begin with. Let's see what it's doing!
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: And i waited 
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: Nothing happened

 Gorbit99: seems like your resolution is small
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: I see
 jacek: you have to scroll down the middle part
 jacek: 1920x1080 small? :o
 jacek: or scroll right&#160;:?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/twjgcj">https://prnt.sc/twjgcj</a>i think there should be some kind of "ok got it" there

 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: ill do this myself
 jacek: oO
 Robertt_The_Bad_Coder: Sorry for wasting your time
 eulerscheZahl: ah, you should hit the play button
 Gorbit99: pic you've posted is not even close to 1920x1080
 eulerscheZahl: collapse the chat first
 Gorbit99: check your monitor resolution settings, it might be borked

 Allis: Do bots have a TrueSkill score?
 JBM:  which bots?
 JBM: come to think of it, i think the answer is yes whichever
 Gorbit99: coc bots?
 Allis: That's how I meant, yeah.
 JBM: i think coc bots are full-fledged accounts
 Allis: I'm wondering if it would explain how I'm pretty sure I recently lost points on a win.
 Gorbit99: well, they are just standard users
 Gorbit99: just driven by a program
 JBM: that you can click on, check out the profile and search in the rankings list

 Memo12334: AY
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: wow
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 dbdr: I see a new era for viewers arriving&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: did you notice that I killed the timeline? :D
 dbdr:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: the scroller at the bottom
 dbdr: just noticed zoom works too
 eulerscheZahl: to select the replay frame
 dbdr: ah yes
 dbdr: why?
 eulerscheZahl: i just deleted all childs
 eulerscheZahl: to kill pixi
 eulerscheZahl: maybe 1 too much :D
 eulerscheZahl: the zooming and such is really all from three.js
 eulerscheZahl: the only thing i did is to include it in the replay
 dbdr: visual bug, maybe the model is imperfect?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/typ8PD.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/typ8PD.jpg</a>

 Astrobytes: impressive!
 dbdr: imagine an optim or multi using that&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: gj on getting the teapot working euler&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 dbdr: 3d graphics faster than 2d pixi :D
 eulerscheZahl: i know :D
 eulerscheZahl: and doesn't make my computer cry
 dbdr: now we can make botg viewer in 3d
 dbdr: and move the camera&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Bugs out a bit. First time the controls were visible, second time they were minimised as normal, third and fourth times no teapot or controls
 eulerscheZahl: just buy a new computer
 eulerscheZahl: every time you plan to load a game
 Astrobytes: (that's when I press play multiple times btw)
 eulerscheZahl: read the description. does it tell you to play again?
 eulerscheZahl: I had to delete the demo replay. somehow the pot was visible for a split second and then disappeared
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: it's definitely not perfect the way it is now. Just wanted to upload a 3D object for the lols
 dbdr: teapots vs kettles multi upcoming?
 Astrobytes: It's great. Wonder what else you can do
 eulerscheZahl: tea vs coffee
 eulerscheZahl: i think you can do pretty much anything that JS can do
 eulerscheZahl: but the code is sandboxed
 eulerscheZahl: so i can't access the user profile
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: or send web requests
 eulerscheZahl: which is a good thing
 Astrobytes: yeah indeed

 cegprakash: oh my isBouncing function flaw I think
 cegprakash: ty
 FLQ4: good luck 
 FLQ4: is neumann a bot 
 Neumann: Non.
 FLQ4: ok 
 Neumann: Why&#160;?
 jrke: someone saying mod a bot :smiley:
 cegprakash: Astrobytes belated wishes
 eulerscheZahl: witch hunt failed. whom do we call a bot next?
 cegprakash: I gift u a :popcorn:
 cegprakash: Player also loses if after his turn the ball cannot be moved.
 cegprakash: does this mean I have to let a valid move for opponent after my move?
 AlwaysBeDream: i got and inf number in js , but can python handle big num&#160;?
 AlwaysBeDream: i see some member already done with the case with python, but i cant see member has done with javascript
 cegprakash: javascript don't have bignum as far as I know
 cegprakash: python by default is big num
 cegprakash: u don't even have to import anything or use a different datatype
 cegprakash: I always use python or java when I need bignum
 AlwaysBeDream: nope
 AlwaysBeDream: ahh , thats why i got inf output
 Xcalibre: C# has a BigInteger class too
 cegprakash: what gives inf?
 AlwaysBeDream: infinity
 eulerscheZahl: JavaScript has the double datatype.So whatever causes this to overflow
 cegprakash: are u using 1/0 or something?
 Gorbit99: ruby is also default bignum
 cegprakash: how big are the numbers u are dealing with AlwaysBeDream
 Gorbit99: but it switches to it only if you need it
 AlwaysBeDream: the case just calculate pow(120 , 324)
 cegprakash: jz
 AlwaysBeDream: haha
 cegprakash: python then
 AlwaysBeDream: i am not using python
 Gorbit99: don't you need pow(120, 324)&#160;% something tho?
 AlwaysBeDream: nope
 cegprakash: or use the bignum library provided in npm
 Gorbit99: really? that's weird
 AlwaysBeDream: can i install some lib in this website&#160;?
 AlwaysBeDream: XD
 Gorbit99: some are already installed, just have to check
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-integer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-integer</a>
 AlwaysBeDream: i dont know about that, i new member here
 cegprakash: this has pow function
 Gorbit99: which puzzle is this btw?
 Andriamanitra: 120^324 doesn't sound right for any puzzle
 Gorbit99: yeee
 AlwaysBeDream: i am join the clash of code
 Gorbit99: clash then
 Gorbit99: what was the text of the coc?
 Gorbit99: or was it just reverse?
 AlwaysBeDream: the case is take the result of pow(a , b) then take 3 digits from number
 Andriamanitra: yeah you don't need the full number to do that
 Gorbit99: OH
 Gorbit99: first three digits?
 Gorbit99: yeah, know that one
 AlwaysBeDream: but  i need the result to take the number
 AlwaysBeDream: yeah
 Andriamanitra: i think i had it too the other day
 Gorbit99: you don't need the full number for it
 cegprakash: jz..
 cegprakash: last 3 digits would have been easier
 AlwaysBeDream: emm, that's my bad
 cegprakash: who asks first 3 digits&#160;:\
 Gorbit99: last 3 would be too easy
 AlwaysBeDream: i am using substr . i just convert it to string
 AlwaysBeDream: XD
 jacek: there is math for that
 Andriamanitra: you can do the math or you can just take first x numbers and hope it's enough
 cegprakash: intention of the puzzle is probably to solve it without using pow function
 Andriamanitra: i did the latter
 AlwaysBeDream: all of participant just complete 83% of the case
 AlwaysBeDream: cuz the 8 case have a big and very big result
 cegprakash: just print rand()%1000
 cegprakash: if you are lucky it can pass
 Gorbit99: yeah, just don't use pow for it
 Gorbit99: that's why they are there
 AlwaysBeDream: oooh,  thank you bruh
 Gorbit99: trying to find the puzzle itself
 Andriamanitra: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5227bf9168ec8ceeb60c226a19e6c5fb1e2e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5227bf9168ec8ceeb60c226a19e6c5fb1e2e</a>
 Gorbit99: you were faster
 AlwaysBeDream: ah , that's the puzzle
 Gorbit99: I approved it
 AlwaysBeDream: i see
 Gorbit99: it does have a cheap trick to it
 cegprakash: is it possible to do something bruteforce like (a^b) MOD (10^p) and try all p where 10^p &lt;= a^b?
 cegprakash: or is there a better math
 eulerscheZahl: i think logarithms could work, didn't do the math
 eulerscheZahl: log(a^b) = b*log(a)
 eulerscheZahl: that's a small number. and then do an operation that is equal to /10 as long as the number is too big
 Andriamanitra: ruby's pow actually seems to be so nicely optimized that it passes just doing a**b :smile:
 Andriamanitra: in python that would time out
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like broken by design
 eulerscheZahl: i mean the clash statement
 Memo12334: hey can I ask an expert something
 Andriamanitra: expert on what?
 Memo12334: coding
 Memo12334: so I have almost done a challenge and I would like to ask how to do something. graffiti on the fence
 Memo12334: everything works expect idk how I would do it when everything is painted
 Memo12334: aka not everything works
 SPDene: read the description again - it says what to print if there are no unpainted bits ("All painted" maybe - i don't remember exactly)
 Memo12334: yes I know..
 SPDene: then I'm not sure what you're asking
 Memo12334: how to code it
 Andriamanitra: if statement?
 Memo12334: yes if whatr
 Andriamanitra: if there are no unpainted sections everything is painted, no?
 Memo12334: yes but how to do that is my question
 SPDene: if (number of unpainted sections == 0 ) ...
 Andriamanitra: i'm confused by the question tbh :smiley:
 Memo12334: did u guys solve the challenge im taklking bout
 SPDene: yes
 Andriamanitra: the exact form of the if statement depends on how you have solved it
 Memo12334: yes so if I add an if then the minor test 1 fails lol
 SPDene: without knowing what language you're using, and what approach you're using to solve the puzzle, this is a bit like asking "what do I write in my essay?"
 Memo12334: how do u guys solve these challenges so easily
 Memo12334: PhD maths?
 SPDene: can't speak for anyone else, but 40 years of coding experience for me :P
 Xcalibre: more like elementary math
 Memo12334: wow that's rlly a lot 
 Memo12334: SPDenewhat language u use
 SPDene: mostly python
 Memo12334: oh nice , not easy language to work with 
 Maxlaxs: wut
 SPDene: it's one of the easiest
 Memo12334: ok then probably for me
 Laminator: A month of practice 
 Andriamanitra: hmm, which language do you think is easier?
 Laminator: familiarity is not the same as easy
 Memo12334: ok that's it probably
 pardouin: maybe you should practice on fundamentals first
 pardouin: cause here the "easy" problems require already a bit of practice
 ChrisBell: Is there a way to continue practicing on a clash of code problem? I<i>ll get into a few of them using bit tricks on paper, but never get to write the C++ for them to test it -.-</i>
 Andriamanitra: ChrisBell use this site to find it in the submissions section where you can freely play with it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/</a>

 pardouin: what clash was that?
 Shashank2409: Shortest code
 pardouin: I know but which one?
 Andriamanitra: find the largest prime i believe
 jacek: so hot :fire:
 pardouin: yeah ruby is good for that with his prime module
 dbdr: heatwave jacek?
 Andriamanitra: require'prime' is too many characters for shortest though
 jacek: yes. and NN training overheating :c
 MSmits: hey... anyone know of a code example for RL used to fit parameters for a boardgame or similar. I don't mean policy, just value function approximation. I find it hard to google examples
 MSmits: everything is more complicated than this or entirely theoretical
 MSmits: doesn't need to be TD either. MC is fine
 MSmits: if I could get something like that working, it would save some CG benchmarking time. 
 MSmits: I do seem to remember you complaining about it too jacek, that you couldn't find good example code
 MSmits: just lots of theory/formulae
 Andriamanitra: RL? TD? MC? i don't know what any of those mean :laughing:
 MSmits: reinforcement learning, temporal difference learning and RL using monte carlo methods
 MSmits: basically, you have a bot, with a bunch of numbers that affect how your bot performs
 MSmits: you let it play vs itself to figure out what the best values for those numbers are
 MSmits: the way you vary and adjust the numbers is given by the type of learning algortihm
 Andriamanitra: ah, machine learning stuff
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: but you end up with a run of the mill bot the way I intend to do it, not some fancy neural network
 MSmits: I just want my parameters to have good values
 jacek: yes, math is meh
 jacek: texel tuning method and the like is/was used for parameter tuning
 MSmits: texel tuning?
 MSmits: sounds good, googled it
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Texel%27s_Tuning_Method#Method">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Texel%27s_Tuning_Method#Method</a>
 MSmits: at least it's confined to the domain in which i want to apply it
 jacek: though its similar to what im doing, playing gazillion games and fit parameters to them
 MSmits: if i look up RL stuff, it's all trying to give me a full overview which i dont need
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: thanks, this should help me a bit
 jacek: NN stuff is diffrent doman. though you can treat your eval as single-layer neuron
 MSmits: yeah i know
 MSmits: for NN there are tons of free tools
 MSmits: because it's popular
 jacek: hmm there is something on reinforcement learning on chess wiki
 MSmits: full alpha zero implementations where you just switch out the game rules for something else
 jacek: yeah but that requires resources which i dont have
 Memo12334: what do u guys do if ur stuck
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: I ask jacek
 MSmits: gotta go for a bit, wife wants to go for a walk, ttyl

 JojoZ.: do you like potatoes&#160;? 
 jacek: tomatoes?
 Meowsuke: pomato?
 Laminator: I once went to cracker barrel and order mashed potatoes, fries, and a baked potato as my 3 sides
 Laminator: It was so good
 LIONSxLEADER: you didn't get the cheezy hashbrowns ... missed out
 FLQ4: i am on the coc grind 
 FLQ4: does anyone have some tips 
 LIONSxLEADER: you passing them?
 Astrobytes: tips? Play multis or do puzzles, not coc :P
 Astrobytes: Otherwise, git gud and grind
 LIONSxLEADER: i have 3 timed monitored coding test interviews over the next week. 
 Astrobytes: On CG or elsewhere LIONSxLEADER?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 for different jobs or for the same?
 LIONSxLEADER: hte COC definately has helped me with my relative speed, without focusing too much on more difficult problems
 LIONSxLEADER: yeah
 LIONSxLEADER: apple is tommorow
 LIONSxLEADER: not on CG
 Astrobytes: Which platform are they using out of interest?
 LIONSxLEADER: apple?
 LIONSxLEADER: codility i belive
 LIONSxLEADER: wait
 LIONSxLEADER: not
 LIONSxLEADER: thats another job
 LIONSxLEADER: they just have a notepad action i belive
 eulerscheZahl: codility lists a lot of popular companies like microsoft, amazon, paypal, ...but no apple as far as i can tell
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 LIONSxLEADER: whiteboardesk
 Memo12334: so codingame helps with getting a job later when git gut
 Astrobytes: ah alright
 Astrobytes: Memo12334, CG's main focus is:codingame.com/work
 LIONSxLEADER: all i know is i never have to code fast, but in the timed tests, you have to
 LIONSxLEADER: so if you dont know the common solutions for easy stuff, you wont finish harder stuff in time
 Astrobytes: Or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a> since I'm a noob
 Memo12334: ooh, ye I do it for fun and to get good in programming. To be a better problem solver
 LIONSxLEADER: you use that to get interviews?
 Astrobytes: No, CG provide interview screening tests like the ones you're going for
 eulerscheZahl: competitor to codility
 LIONSxLEADER: i see
 Memo12334: It takes approximately 10 hours for one easy challenge for me
 LIONSxLEADER: why dont you guys have scored for bigO?
 Astrobytes: You'll get faster Memo12334
 LIONSxLEADER: scores*
 Memo12334: feels bad ;p
 Astrobytes: It's kinda puzzle dependent LIONSxLEADER, some are dependent on efficiency, some aren't (puzzle-wise)
 eulerscheZahl: it is badbut totally normal when you are new to the field
 Memo12334: how do I become like u guys or are u guys born with the skills
 Memo12334: like genetics
 LIONSxLEADER: do it for a decade or 2, you get better
 Memo12334: lmao 
 LIONSxLEADER: good memory helps
 Memo12334: decade = 10 years
 eulerscheZahl: hard trainingmaybe a mix of training and talent
 Astrobytes: I'm not even a dev by trade, just practice and use that amazing thing attached to your spinal cord&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and the practicing doesn't feel like it as long as you enjoy it
 Astrobytes: ^
 LIONSxLEADER: i just hate how the challenges go nowhere
 LIONSxLEADER: you build on your own knowledge
 Astrobytes: If you don't enjoy it then you either are interested and lack training/practice, or just aren't really interested
 LIONSxLEADER: but if you dont use it you forget it
 Astrobytes: For the puzzles?
 LIONSxLEADER: so all the time spent gets semi lost vs working on a project 
 LIONSxLEADER: just talking about how practicing increasingly difficult puzzles, can start to have diminishing return value vs working on projects of your own or others
 LIONSxLEADER: in terms of what you have to show for the time spent
 Memo12334: rlly? I would think it rlly levels one problem solving ability
 Astrobytes: Well, it's about fun, practice and/or learning/improving skills. Personal projects may take priority, that's OK!
 LIONSxLEADER: agreed
 LIONSxLEADER: but in terms of getting a job you need a portfolio and the ability to code these kinds of tests to pass thier automated filters
 Memo12334: but lions
 Astrobytes: You need problem solving skills mostly
 Memo12334: don't these puzzles level one proble msolvin ability. isnt programming about problem solving anyway
 Astrobytes: Most jobs in any STEM field require problem solving
 LIONSxLEADER: oh i wasnt discounting it
 Astrobytes: #1 priority
 LIONSxLEADER: i was just talking about diminishing returns
 LIONSxLEADER: does codinggame do any crownsourced projects?
 LIONSxLEADER: crowd
 Astrobytes: Sure, I mean don't focus on CG if it's taking you away from more productive projects
 Astrobytes: No to your crowdsourced project question
 LIONSxLEADER: so breaking up a project into small parts and having everyone work on them duolingo style 
 LIONSxLEADER: that sounds like a fun coding project
 Memo12334: bruh
 Astrobytes: Feel free to team up with some people and make a multiplayer game using the CG SDK then&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: yay to more multiplayer games
 Astrobytes: But it'll all be Java in the end
 Astrobytes: Is yours ready to pitch now euler? As in finished and ready to sell to Thibaud?
 LIONSxLEADER: do you know about duolingo?
 eulerscheZahl: just waiting for thibaud to be back
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: get thibaud on my sidestep 2: find testersstep 3: possible changesstep 4: contest
 eulerscheZahl: step 0: you are here
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 LIONSxLEADER: how the people learning the language by solving tests are actively translating untranslated texts
 Memo12334: eulerschezahl
 eulerscheZahl: Memo12334
 Memo12334: did u do personal projects too or only codingame if I may ask
 jacek: personal projects eh
 eulerscheZahl: CG is my center of activity. but i've been active elsewhere too
 Astrobytes: LIONSxLEADER spell this out in a CG-related context for me if you will please (I'm familiar with duolingo yes)
 eulerscheZahl: also: CG projects doesn't limit to solving puzzles or playing multiplayer games.e.g. you can build a website to add a feature your are missing, build your own games (in a team with other users, ...)
 LIONSxLEADER: i am imagining this large process that starts with the description of a program
 LIONSxLEADER: then goes to TDD stage where you task people to write the tests for the description
 eulerscheZahl: and then we build the functionality first, write tests and commit+push in reverse order :P
 LIONSxLEADER: you take the "best" Tests and offer them as the next problems
 Astrobytes: Isn't this just the Contribution system gone wild?&#160;:)
 LIONSxLEADER: everyone solves the problems. viola. working progam&#160;:)
 LIONSxLEADER: indeed
 LIONSxLEADER: but just like everything
 LIONSxLEADER: how its offered means everything
 LIONSxLEADER: i know so easy right&#160;;).
 Astrobytes: I mean, contributions are based on this kind of idea in terms of review etc. People come up with additional testcases/validators etc. I see what you mean with trying to formalise that but it would be quite a shift for the platform no?
 LIONSxLEADER: oh i dunno, an extra category or two for parts of programs you need but dont have
 Astrobytes: Hard thing to gamify imo
 LIONSxLEADER: or likely dont
 LIONSxLEADER: like the webservices of api requests
 LIONSxLEADER: or*
 LIONSxLEADER: or writing test cases
 LIONSxLEADER: stuff you need to do for any job
 LIONSxLEADER: i agree
 pcc_gaming: hello 
 LIONSxLEADER: hard to gamify
 tutubalin: dear moderator. we've got a problem in #ru chanel. who has enough right to kick/back flooders?
 Astrobytes: Most people come here for a break from work LIONSxLEADER
 JBM: don't you have uljahn there
 Astrobytes: jiki again tutubalin?
 tutubalin: yes, but his rights have not been approved yet
 Astrobytes: I can't kick him
 Astrobytes: or ban
 tutubalin: Astrobytes yes. now he's not just flooding, but also offence people
 Astrobytes: ffs
 LIONSxLEADER: really? id imagine it was the opposite
 LIONSxLEADER: people trying to find work
 jiki: ban Ulian tutubalin
 Uljahn: i can kick him here but not in #ru
 jiki: insults mans
 LIONSxLEADER: do the demographics say that?
 JBM: weird system
 Astrobytes: well, I banned him here
 Astrobytes: LIONSxLEADER remember the 2 sides to CG, there's the recruitment side (so you get people practicing for job related stuff) then you have the more informal competitive programming side
 LIONSxLEADER: interesting
 Astrobytes: JBM, they messed up the mod rights a bit
 JBM: yeah, i can tell
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 JBM: no mods on #ru
 jacek: :scream:
 JBM: or #de, but then again that's not exactly a pressing issue
 Astrobytes: hehe true
 JBM: rumors of #de being idle are greatly exagerated
 JBM: i for one only have one week of  history there
 JBM: far cry from the two weeks i've seen advertised
 Astrobytes: Well, some of us took a little holiday to #de for a short while recently :P
 JBM: how long is it goingto take them to recover that precious idle time
 Zenoscave: a week about
 Zenoscave: just guessing
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: tutubalin should be OK for a while now at least
 tutubalin: thank you!
 tutubalin: or whoever did it
 Astrobytes: Magus has #ru mod rights, thibaud will fix it so we all have mod rights in #ru when he returns from holiday
 tutubalin: we really tolerated him for a long time and tried to convince him to behave appropriately
 Astrobytes: (Magus did it)
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, I'm aware of his behaviour
 Zenoscave: Astro did you solve BBP Pi yet?
 Astrobytes: Yes! Or I wouldn't have approved it
 Zenoscave: What lang?
 Astrobytes: I did it in Go because I'm a masochist
 Zenoscave: I'm interested in learning other approaches
 Astrobytes: Well, I was practicing
 Zenoscave: cool!
 Astrobytes: Pretty much just did the Bailey way
 Astrobytes: I'm interested enough to try other approaches, I wasn't aware of this at all before your puzzle
 Zenoscave: Spigots can be really usefull for some mathematical approximations?
 Zenoscave: *!
 Astrobytes: definitely yes
 Astrobytes: Your python solution was very clean btw.
 Zenoscave: thank you!
 Zenoscave: I optimized to remove floating point arithmetic
 Zenoscave: so it's a little clunky now but blinding fast
 Astrobytes: Yeah I noticed. Very well done!
 Zenoscave: thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I gotta shoot, gn dude and gn all
 JBM: gn A
 mohsinalipro: hello from Pakistan!
 AntiSquid: hi
 Gorbit99:  I have most of my solo games systems working
 JBM: yay
 Gorbit99: just need a bot for it
 inoryy: what's the website that hosts CG chat logs?
 JBM: cg.spdns.eu iirc
 JBM: want to catch up on all the jiki you missed?
 inoryy: that's the one, thanks!
 kiikii: Anyone have any tips for references of coding interview type problems for f#?
 Gorbit99: my personal coding interview practice place is codesignal
 kiikii: thanks ill check it out
 FionaZe: how can I debug on the platform?
 jrke: can every lang hold 65 bit int&#160;?
 nfgCodex: do you h av eto wait for all players to finish the Clash of Code to get credit or something?

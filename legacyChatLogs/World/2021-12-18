 Wontonimo: yeah, he changed his profile recently ... let me see if i can find his old profile

 Wontonimo: ^^ that's his original account
 Wontonimo: or dummy account
 Wontonimo: or hacking account
 Wontonimo: idk
 Jerrasterix: He is a legend indeed!!
 Jerrasterix: he seems to have done all the puzzles CG has 
 Flaise: Man...
 Wontonimo: well, there is an easy way of getting the solutions, so he doesn't actually have to do them
 Flaise: Makes me totally question my philosophy of doing it the hard way
 Jerrasterix: how&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: same Flaise 
 Wontonimo: don't spoil the site for yourself and go looking for the solutions.  just dont
 Jerrasterix: I used to when I learnt programming last year.... 
 Jerrasterix: now I am as honest as I can be 
 Wontonimo: if you want fake internet points, yeah, his way is best.  if you want to have fun and learn stuff, his way probably isn't going to get you there
 Jerrasterix: I have a doubt, How did my bot went from bronze 30s to gold in botters of galaxy :confused:&#160;??
 Wontonimo: oh, congrats!
 Jerrasterix: I am still bluffled
 Wontonimo: i can't get a break iin that game
 Jerrasterix: dude I didn't touch that for months
 Wontonimo: nope, i'm still in bronze
 Jerrasterix: Mine was just attacking, retreating and buying whatever I could...
 Jerrasterix: for Tron battle, did you use Voronoi diagram&#160;??
 Wontonimo: yes, but more specifically synchronous flood fill.
 Jerrasterix: ohhh,,,, I tried it a couple of days b4
 Jerrasterix: Its suiciding...
 Wontonimo: your tron?
 Jerrasterix: yeah
 Jerrasterix: Its moving for some 20 moves and crasjing into itself&#160;:(
 Jerrasterix: *crashing

 Wontonimo: yes, i see
 Wontonimo: how are you using flood fill to drive decision making?
 Jerrasterix: Nope 
 Jerrasterix: Class started for me&#160;:( , Bye Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: later
 Jerrasterix: Idk flood fill btw
 Wontonimo: here is the puzzle that will help with synchronous flood fill <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/flood-fill-example">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/flood-fill-example</a>
 Flaise: Wontonimo: Fair point about the "fake internet points". I'm here to practice and hopefully present a genuine-looking profile to potential employers.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: "his way"?  What is that supposed to mean?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Several french have done more puzzles than me, do they have a "way" as well?

 Jerrasterix: wait boss1 is -2.35&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: WTF&#160;??
 Fira19: i dont think 
 DialFrost: lmao fewest ppl i've seen online
 DialFrost: 3 ppl in chat only
 jacek: happy Caturday
 DialFrost:&#160;:)
 DialFrost: anyone here willingly to check something real quick
 DialFrost: rly easy qns
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">https://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 DialFrost: im asking this cuz i dont want random ppl stealing the code
 DialFrost: and i wont pm ppl without getting their consent first
 jacek: Automaton2000 will you look at that
 Automaton2000: it's about the fact that you have a good reference
 BlaiseEbuth: and people will not accept to help you without even knowing what is it about.
 DialFrost: fine its about mad
 BlaiseEbuth: *it is
 DialFrost: plus all one needs to do is understand wat it means
 DialFrost: done
 BlaiseEbuth: -_-
 rekaxem: hi
 DialFrost: elo
 DialFrost: lo
 DialFrost: whoops
 DialFrost: ello*
 rekaxem: ello
 Maxamas: wagwan my frilla
 Maxamas: drilla*
 BlaiseEbuth: And people are supposed to go ahead to try to help you without knowing what language you use, or what league you're in? You know, all this details that can help someone to know if he even could help you&#160;?
 DialFrost: thats the thing
 DialFrost: u dont need to know
 DialFrost: cuz its not mine
 DialFrost: its magus's or well from his website
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: And you don't want people to stole the code he shared publicly?
 DialFrost: steal*
 DialFrost: actually u have to find it if u wanna see it
 BlaiseEbuth: Dude... This site is linked about 50 times one the MPR's forum topic
 BlaiseEbuth: *on
 DialFrost: and if ur not answering my question then stop
 DialFrost: js pm me if u wanna lecture me
 DialFrost: instead of filling the chat so no one can see the question
 BlaiseEbuth: I didn't see the question either...
 DialFrost: very funny if u didnt see the qns how'd u know to "lecture" me hmm?
 BlaiseEbuth: "Do someone want to help me with something? I will not give any precision because  mean people will steal the code" isn't a valid question... You can insist, correct my english, say me to stop, that doesn't change the fact that people here will not take on their time to help you without knowing if they can before, or even the time that will take.
 DialFrost: nice speech
 LelouchVC2: Ladies, your both beautiful
 LelouchVC2: But I'm not interested
 LelouchVC2: I'm sorry
 DialFrost: should i consider that a compliment or an insult
 DialFrost: ur first line
 rekaxem: why am i getting so many security checks
 DialFrost: captcha?
 rekaxem: yes
 DialFrost: er idk
 DialFrost: depends if u like click submit too many times
 rekaxem: im just playing clash of code
 DialFrost: oh
 DialFrost: idk
 jacek: too much clash oc coding
 BlaiseEbuth: The link is even on the game front page :rofl:
 Jerrasterix: may I know who in this f**king world gave logical opertaors a lower precedence than equality&#160;??
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: Isn't equality a logical operator?
 Jerrasterix: Woops I meant bitwise operator
 BlaiseEbuth: Seems logical. No?
 wlesavo: yay carebaens legend :slight_smile:
 DialFrost: congrats!
 Jerrasterix: Congrats&#160;!!
 DialFrost: btw guys in this code
 DialFrost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f3da9bff-79c8-44ff-bf5c-4330b0db5a00">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f3da9bff-79c8-44ff-bf5c-4330b0db5a00</a>
 DialFrost: wat does this.angle mean
 Jerrasterix: Not for me BlaiseEbuth
 wlesavo: pushed 7 people in the mean time :smiley:
 Jerrasterix: you must be feeling happy for that :laughing:
 wlesavo: DialFrost the code is for a method of a class, so this.angle is a property of an instance of a class the method is called for 
 DialFrost: er since this is mad pod racing
 DialFrost: is it the angle of the pod?
 BlaiseEbuth: Why Jerrasterix? I mean, why 'a&amp;b==c&amp;d' is more strange than 'a+b==c+d'? 
 Jerrasterix: Its not stranger than it&#160;!! That's what I am saying 
 Jerrasterix: Then why does bitwise have a lower precedence than equality&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: bitwise produce diversity of values while equality can only be true or false. When the choice of precedence had been made, it seemed more useful to favorise comparison on bitwise operation results rather than use of bitwises on booleans. :shrug:
 Jerrasterix: Ohhhh....
 Jerrasterix: Thanks for explaining BlaiseEbuth&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: When in doubt, put brackes everywhere!
 BlaiseEbuth: That's the angle you get in input DialFrost btw
 DialFrost: ic
 DialFrost: thx blaise~

 TimothyAlexisVass: :joy:
 Jerrasterix: ig not
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: he is a real person
 Jerrasterix: well, they seem to be from a korean drama 
 Thorcode: actually he's from australia
 Jerrasterix: What the&#160;??
 5DN1L: Wait until you see him: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/ab1d65237f6c3b52d46bd65a842d41ae5884264">https://www.codingame.com/profile/ab1d65237f6c3b52d46bd65a842d41ae5884264</a>
 Thorcode: nah I chatted with him on discord
 Jerrasterix: he is a real person
 Jerrasterix: but is he like on his pfp
 5DN1L: AlkhilJohn, AlkhilJohn., AlkhilJohnStan
 Jerrasterix: that's question&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: even a mod is spamming :unamused:
 5DN1L: it's information provision
 5DN1L: letting you guys know two other profiles which copy from the clash of codes bot
 Jerrasterix: you can't copy humphh&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: Yeah, even I was thinking him as a bot till this morning when he posted a contribution 
 5DN1L: it's a bit confusing to say the least. but well, at least better than that day the other guy copied MY profile &gt;.&lt;
 5DN1L: or i should say, not worse instead of better
 Jerrasterix: what did you do 
 5DN1L: i told Thibaud who took that guy's account off
 5DN1L: who then*
 Jerrasterix: well by copying , wdym&#160;??
 5DN1L: use my profile pic
 5DN1L: and use a name very similar to mine
 5DN1L: even existed on this chat for a while
 Jerrasterix: :laughing:
 5DN1L: claiming that he was the real one
 Jerrasterix: he went far on that 
 5DN1L: yeah, he did
 5DN1L: luckily it was resolved quickly
 Jerrasterix: yup 
 Jerrasterix: You used MC in CSB??
 5DN1L: who, me?
 Jerrasterix: yeah
 5DN1L: no, i just duplicated my first pod's simplest behaviour for my second pod  :joy:
 5DN1L: too busy to do anything more complex than that
 TimothyAlexisVass: Can I see a clash again after I've done it? It was a pathfinding task and I didn't solve 100% in time. I Want to solve it...
 5DN1L: try searching the clash here:

 Jerrasterix: you are faster than me&#160;:(
 5DN1L: bookmarked it :P
 Jerrasterix: ohhh lol
 TimothyAlexisVass: Found it, thank you
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 TimothyAlexisVass: Lol, I will be impressed to see someone solve this in 15 minutes, even the author of this one.
 5DN1L: is it a dragon one?
 Jerrasterix: The deadliest part is it was approved
 Jerrasterix: nope a simple one "as per author"
 TimothyAlexisVass: Doodlerabout 4 years ago
 5DN1L: i mean there
 TimothyAlexisVass: "The mere fact that I solved it, urged me to approve it. One of the toughest clashes ever I think."
 5DN1L: oops
 TimothyAlexisVass: lol

 TimothyAlexisVass: Contributor wrote"I myself barely finished in 15 minutes. So not sure whether its okay..."
 5DN1L: i do have a generic code for something like that. not sure if 15 minutes is enough to adapt to the inputs and stuff
 Jerrasterix: where did you learn pathfinding algo from&#160;??
 5DN1L: Google?
 Jerrasterix: like any resource&#160;??
 5DN1L: lots of resources on the web
 TimothyAlexisVass: DFS or BFS
 jacek: he used pathfinding to find it
 Jerrasterix: i need both

 Jerrasterix: ohhhh you need graphs for both&#160;??
 TimothyAlexisVass: Not reallyl
 Jerrasterix: idk graphs&#160;:(
 5DN1L: graphs just a way to connect the dots with lines i think :think:
 TimothyAlexisVass: You don't "need" graphs
 Jerrasterix: ohhh 
 TimothyAlexisVass: You can use DFS to find the shortest path from point A to B in a graph structure.
 TimothyAlexisVass: You have a bunch of nodes with links to other nodes
 TimothyAlexisVass: What is the shortest path from node A to B&#160;?
 Jerrasterix: okay how do you get the route from the stack... 
 TimothyAlexisVass: What do you mean?
 Jerrasterix: They say, you have push the starting to stack and keep on pushing the adjacent unvisited nodes to it 
 Jerrasterix: and you have to do that till you reach the end point 
 TimothyAlexisVass: What programming language are you using?
 Jerrasterix: C# 
 Jerrasterix: why&#160;??'

 jacek: DFS - stack. BFS - queue
 jacek: kthxbai
 Jerrasterix: I know about stacks and queues
 Jerrasterix: okay, the order of points in a stack or queue is the path right&#160;??
 TimothyAlexisVass: "okay how do you get the route from the stack..."
 TimothyAlexisVass: The stack is the route
 TimothyAlexisVass: yeah
 Jerrasterix: okay, I messed up on understanding that one :P
 Jerrasterix: Thank you everyone 
 TimothyAlexisVass: You can generate an array of all possible paths
 TimothyAlexisVass: and then draw conclusions based on that for example, which one is the shortest
 Jerrasterix:&#160;:+1:
 TimothyAlexisVass: I need to learn pathfinding better myself obviously because I didn't solve this clash.&#160;:)
 Jerrasterix: dude no one solved that one 
 Jerrasterix: I once had it for clash 
 TimothyAlexisVass: But apparently, the author barely did too :D
 Jerrasterix: everyone 0%
 TimothyAlexisVass: I think, if I had more experience with DFS, I could have solved it easily.
 TimothyAlexisVass: especially with itertools
 5DN1L: I think you need BFS for shortest path
 Jerrasterix: do you write a Node class to represent the nodes&#160;??
 5DN1L: Ah, this is a puzzle to practise path finding too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/dungeon-3d">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/dungeon-3d</a>

 Jerrasterix: thorcode&#160;??
 Thorcode: I'm training on codewar
 Thorcode: I'm kinda trash when asking that question
 Jerrasterix: wait does codewars have path finding algo question&#160;??
 5DN1L: why not
 Thorcode: it have alot

 BlaiseEbuth: How did you hear about it 5DN1L? You readed all the forum from the start? ^^
 jacek: not so hidden anymore eh
 5DN1L: some other forum threads mention that post :P
 5DN1L: the evolution of CG or something like that
 5DN1L: it's stilll hidden in the sense that you can't search it in the usual way
 Jerrasterix: but only 2,... disappointed 
 BlaiseEbuth: Well... Even already beeing there at this time, I didn't know about it... :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L: it's kind of an experimental thing i guess

 5DN1L: you can if it is correct to do so
 Overbed: where?
 Overbed: w=w.split()?
 5DN1L: before you print your final output perhaps?

 lakaoe: but its only printing ow many digits in the last line 
 lakaoe: thats when there are no digits overbed
 5DN1L: is your identation wrong
 lakaoe: idk whats wrong
 lakaoe: but its only printing how many digits in the last line 
 lakaoe: i have to do the first line to
 lakaoe: too
 5DN1L: your code doesn't do the below for loop until after it's finished the reading for loop
 5DN1L: i think your indentation is wrong
 5DN1L: (and identation is spelled wrong, sad)
 lakaoe: how do i fix that/
 lakaoe:&#160;?
 lakaoe: its private coc btw
 5DN1L: push that indentation to the correct position?

 Vienkk: where is my history clash?
 mussie:&#160;;
 Vienkk: Where is my Participations?
 5DN1L: What do you mean Vienkk?
 lakaoe: Mismatch with the stub generator input: Input not read entirely (6)
 lakaoe: what does this mean
 5DN1L: That means your stub generator reads fewer variables than your specified inputs probably
 lakaoe: how do i add a variable in the stub generator
 5DN1L: are you making a contribution?
 lakaoe: yeah, its for my nephew that wants to start coding python a bit
 lakaoe: so i made a code where he has to solve it using if, else function
 Vienkk: I played 3 games but I can't find my code history

 Uljahn: :tada:
 jacek: oO
 Ukraineboi86: where can i go to learn c++
 TimothyAlexisVass: Try :earth:
 NotANick: You will use ISO/IEC 14882:2020 pdf's for c++ standarts you can find free versions on that pdf in everywhere and they are not illegal they are just incompleted(like beta but %99 completed) versions
 jacek: 2020? i barely use c++11 features
 NotANick: yes but its standart
 NotANick: and everyone already use minimum c++11 in their projects
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm sure you still can find companies who works on older versions.
 jacek: like CG
 Lambert_W_Function: gaming
 Rddevelop: given a puzzle all the 12 testcases pass but after submitting the testcase nº 12 fails and i have no clue why
 Rddevelop: any idea?

 Rddevelop: yeah i understand that but the testcase that failed is called "random small number" so i was hoping there was a way to see the input that the testcase used
 Flaise: You can print that to stderr
 Rddevelop: my bad i meant validator, testcases passed but a validator failed afterwards
 Flaise: Oh you mean when you click submit
 TimothyAlexisVass: It happens...
 Rddevelop: yeah
 Flaise: Unfortunately, they can't share those because it would defeat the hard-coding protection
 5DN1L: Better test your code on all the small numbers offine
 Flaise: I had a Clash of code give me a 50% or something on the validation after all tests were green in the IDE. I was miffed.
 Rddevelop: yeah i ll do that
 5DN1L: For some puzzles it's easier to test offline. I know it's difficult for some other puzzles and that's frustrating. nothing can be done about that except to seek help and be more patient to go through the code again and again
 TimothyAlexisVass: hhmmmmm
 TimothyAlexisVass: Can't connect to recaptcha
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: we usually just share the validator if someone is stuck on just one
 jacek: "we"?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: we helpful frenchwomen
 Astrobytes: (shared in private message ofc)
 TimothyAlexisVass: Frenchwomen?
 jacek: whats frenchwo?
 Rddevelop: actually i want it yeah, i message you
 5DN1L: helpful frenchwomen will get more private messages from now on :D
 jacek: Automaton2000 message me a solution
 Automaton2000: but if you use visual studio
 Rddevelop: guys
 Rddevelop: some1 remember the river ll puzzle?
 Rddevelop: so the validator that was failing is 40, its expecting a YES, but 40 is never a meeting point of a single river besides himself
 5DN1L: {7, 14, 19, 29, 40, ... }
 5DN1L: Exactly the example given in the puzzle statement
 Rddevelop: yeah
 Rddevelop: i mean
 Rddevelop: i should get some sleep XD
 5DN1L: :smirk: good night
 Rddevelop: yeah finally 100%, lets just say that i have no clue how it passed 91% tests with the error i found
 5DN1L: :tada:
 TimothyAlexisVass: -_- -_-
 TheProGremer: hello
 danieeeeeeel: last christmas
 danieeeeeeel: i gave you my code
 danieeeeeeel: but the very next day
 5DN1L: you gave me a bug?
 Majeck: you handed it in late?
 danieeeeeeel: thiiiiiiiiiiis year
 danieeeeeeel: to save me from tears...
 ardacera: im a terrible programer i should die
 5DN1L: That reason is not good enough
 BADSUGAR: I just don't understand the simplest exercise haha
 5DN1L: is it something on this website?
 BADSUGAR: Oh yeah, I'm trying to understand the first pod race
 ardacera: i am not even enough for finding a valid reason to die. Ohh god!
 danieeeeeeel: start using javascript
 BADSUGAR: Yeah I'm using Javascript because it's the only language I have "seen" so far
 BADSUGAR: I'm more used to the syntaxe. But I'm still clueless on how to make this darn pod move
 BADSUGAR:&#160;:)
 jacek: the tutorial should tell you
 jacek: is this the one with nextCheckpointY +" " + nextCheckpointY?
 BADSUGAR: Yeah it's this one
 5DN1L: y-coord + y-coord
 5DN1L: is
 5DN1L: wrong
 AmineACH51: Hello
 BADSUGAR: Heya
 BADSUGAR: I don't understand haha, i wrote something that doesn't move my pod but I still completed the race :joy:
 BADSUGAR: from clueless to abuse haha
 jacek: you wrote the X + Y?
 BADSUGAR: Hm not the numnbers 
 BADSUGAR: Am I suppose to write words or numbers :joy:
 5DN1L: depends on whether you want fixed values or variable amounts
 5DN1L: and BOOST is the only word command you'll need
 5DN1L: it can be used once only
 5DN1L: at this stage
 BADSUGAR: I can't even make the pod move in any direction, even when I write the checkpoint coords
 BADSUGAR: I'm not boosting soon haha
 5DN1L: in which league are you now?
 BADSUGAR: How do you check this&#160;?
 5DN1L: look at the top bar
 BADSUGAR: It just says Mad Pod Racing
 5DN1L: And next to that?
 BADSUGAR: Nothing&#160;:)
 5DN1L: Does your url include "ide"?
 BADSUGAR: yes sir
 5DN1L: How curious :joy:
 BADSUGAR: I'm resetting the game haha
 5DN1L: Did you even receive any message telling you that you've been promoted, the rules have been updated, that sort of things?
 BADSUGAR: Not at all
 5DN1L: Meaning: you've made no progress probably :smirk:
 5DN1L: That's why I can't find you in the leaderboard
 5DN1L: I guess
 BADSUGAR: Ok I'm making progress ..
 BADSUGAR: Cool! :D
 5DN1L: :clap:
 BADSUGAR: It was a space missing somewhere I guess
 5DN1L: That could happen, yeah
 BADSUGAR: Wood 3 finally! :D
 5DN1L: Wood 3 is the starting league
 BADSUGAR: Yeah but I understood, now I'm ready to fight my way up :D
 BADSUGAR: I'm not that stupid :joy:
 5DN1L: Of course not&#160;:)
 5DN1L: Newcomers need time to get used to the interface
 BADSUGAR: Yeah it's just that I typed the good thing pretty early but I placed two ' ' without any space inbetween. The log returned that a ) was missing and from this attempt I went to far. I tried adding new console.logs, get rid of the newCheckpoint const etc
 BADSUGAR: I tried basically everything haha
 5DN1L: and you figured it out finally
 BADSUGAR: YES!
 5DN1L: :tada:
 BADSUGAR: Thank you for the help and the time you spend on my case :pray:
 5DN1L: You're welcome&#160;:)
 5DN1L: jacek also helped
 BADSUGAR: True, thanks Jacek too!
 BADSUGAR: You guys are amazing
 5DN1L: :blush:
 JBM: yeah we are
 TimothyAlexisVass: -_-
 Darkblade5641: i'm trying to implement the trigonometry feature for better hitting the checkpoints. anyone know a direction? i'm just not sure how to integrate the sin and cos functions properly...
 JBM: go west
 skotz: for csb? iirc magus had a good postmortem. might find a link in the forum
 DialFrost: morning guys
 Darkblade5641: if speed is prev_distance - distance, and i store distance into prev_distance after this calculation, how do i make this work in python? anyone?
 Darkblade5641: i tried to store as None when initializing, but then there's a type conflict with the subtraction
 DialFrost: idk mate sry
 DialFrost: although im working on csb too &lt;33
 Darkblade5641: awesome! what league you in?
 DialFrost: gold
 Thorcode: wwood 2
 Darkblade5641: Silver
 Darkblade5641: are you using trig?
 programer53: how do you code
 programer53: kjn 
 TimothyAlexisVass: I code with fingers on keyboard
 AlkhilJohn.: Damn it
 AlkhilJohn.: Shit
 AlkhilJohn.: Hacking codingame is hard
 AlkhilJohn.: I tried hacking my username and rank and stuff to that of AlkhilJohn
 AlkhilJohn.: Too many network requests and nodes and stuff
 AlkhilJohn.: I changed all data stores to empty disctionaries
 AlkhilJohn.: But I couldn't change my IP and id to that of AlkhilJohn
 AlkhilJohn.: lmao
 Flaise: Yeah I code with fingers on keyboard too.
 struct: AlkhilJohn. you need to step it up
 struct: not even the image is the same
 AlkhilJohn.: I know

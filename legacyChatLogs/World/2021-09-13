 ProCoder03: For FlatMC in CvZ, should I make the guy move towards an random zombie&#160;??
 darkhorse64: moving towards a zombie is not always a good move for scoring. IRL, it never is
 ProCoder03: Then&#160;??
 ProCoder03: should we move towards the person who has most zombies on his trail&#160;??
 darkhorse64: Actually, I have used a GA for solving. My initial guess is completely random moves and my fitness function is just the score
 ProCoder03: wow, GA... I don't know GA!!
 ProCoder03: Need to learn it then...
 ProCoder03: Ahh... I found out one, in forum..
 ProCoder03: Thanks darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: for starting, you can do the following: say you solution is an array of moves (40 is enough). Fill it randomly, run the sim, eval. Then, make an random mutation on the array, sim, eval, keep the best. Repeat until you run out of time. This is called hill climbing
 darkhorse64: This should be better than flatMC
 ProCoder03: Awesome&#160;!! Thanks
 ProCoder03: but how do we do a random mutation
 darkhorse64: Select a random place in your array and change the current value with a random one
 ProCoder03: :thumbsup:
 darkhorse64: A GA uses a pool of solutions. At each cycle, you keep the best solutions and you build a new solution from two randomly selected solutions. For a given move, you pick randomly a move from one or the other solution. You can also keep part of one solution and fill the remainder from the other
 ProCoder03: just like hill climbing in a tournament style, right&#160;?
 darkhorse64: You can also keep some of the best solutions with a random mutation and have a new few random solutions to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. Yep, the tournament style is probably the right picture
 ProCoder03: Thank you so much darkhorse64
 JustinZhang: Oh what is GA
 ProCoder03: Genetic algorithm
 darkhorse64: There are many twists you can apply to a GA: pool size, rate of mutation which have a dramatic effect on the efficiency. Genetic algorithm. So there is no single implementation for a GA
 darkhorse64: The most important things are how you model your problem (which parameters you evolve) and the fitness function
 ProCoder03: the fitness function is the scoring function right??
 darkhorse64: For CvZ, yes. This is enough. For more complex problems, you need to evaluate many more features
 ProCoder03: why does CG take my completion in to account while finding the best score??
 ProCoder03: Can't they just take the best score :confused:
 darkhorse64: Your goals is to save at least one human per test
 ProCoder03: :disappointed:
 darkhorse64: Humans score high
 ProCoder03: wow, even my naive method seems to be performing good :smiley:
 apcoder: Hey can anyone help me with stub generator input.I am new to contributions.
 JustinZhang: thanks guy
 gigabuffoon: Made it to top 100 clash tonight!! Exciting&#160;:) fun platform

 kyoya34: hello
 kyoya34: have any of you guys completed dont panic episode one?
 Uljahn: sure
 kyoya34: im not able to pass all test cases
 kyoya34: how did u do it
 Uljahn: debug
 kyoya34: uhh..im a begginer bro
 BlaiseEbuth: debug
 ProCoder03: is there anything like beginner can't debug or what :confused:
 littlebear: good evening
 kyoya34: there is no error in my code to debug
 kyoya34: it passed 5/7 test cases
 kyoya34: but it takes too long
 kyoya34: and i cant find any way to decrease the time complexity
 ProCoder03: what language&#160;??
 kyoya34: cpp
 ProCoder03: and if statements shouldn't take long 
 kenav: have you used cerr &lt;&lt; "Debug messages..." &lt;&lt; endl;&#160;?
 kenav: check all the variables on the last floor&#160;:)
 kenav: kyoya34, sorry I thought you were talking about "Submiting" code. To pass tests - make sure you used "elevatorFloor" and  "elevatorPos"  variables&#160;:)
 kyoya34: thats the thing...i am not getting how to use elevator pos variable
 kyoya34: elevator pos is defined inside a loop..so i cant use it outside
 ProCoder03: just define it outside and use 
 ProCoder03: Ezpz
 kenav: +1.  feel free to change auto-generated code&#160;! 
 kyoya34: ok..thanlyou
 kyoya34: thankyou*

 ProCoder03: Can someone explain conway sequence please&#160;?
 C26_1: Conway sequence is a sequence started with two first terms equal to 1 as feeds
 C26_1: Here we denoted P(n) as nth number in Conway sequence
 ProCoder03: Thanks...
 C26_1: The recursion relation is this: p(n) = p(p(n-1)) + p(n-p(n-1))
 Astrobytes: *recurrence

 C26_1: um, I have a question: What website can I put my math research into without cost and without needed PhD. I know it's unrelated to computer science but help me this once
 C26_1: I'm search in google for a while but it didn't resolve the problem
 struct: isnt research gate free?
 C26_1: Ummmmmmmmmmm
 C26_1: Im gonna go to that webiste for a moment
 AllYourTrees: arxiv
 C26_1: website*
 AllYourTrees:&#160;?
 C26_1: Arxiv is good but it didn't help you create your own paper
 C26_1: hold up a second
 C26_1: ResearchGate website needs your research email
 C26_1: How can I use my email to become research email
 struct: ah I didnt remember that research mail was needed

 Hiro-GG: welp
 Hiro-GG: i did everything correct and i got success on all tests
 Hiro-GG: but i got 75%
 Hiro-GG: why
 Astrobytes: validators&#160;!= tests
 Astrobytes: They're different to prevent hardcoded answers.
 Hiro-GG: i did the same thing i did in another game
 Hiro-GG: on the last game i got 100%
 Hiro-GG: but on this one i got 75%
 Hiro-GG: i dont understand it bruh
 Hiro-GG: i did the exact same

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/</a>that bar chart is loading slower and slower, maybe i should optimize the query
 BlaiseEbuth: select * from *
 eulerscheZahl: much worse. I extracted some properties such as author and type (clash/puzzle) in separate columns. but also store the full json response in my DB
 struct: Who shows as owner of yavalath?
 eulerscheZahl: for the chart I realized that I haven't stored the date in its own column. so I parse the full json each time you load the chart
 eulerscheZahl: it's struct because I stored that contrib before you deleted
 struct: I see
 littlebear: lol

 AllYourTrees: okay for multiple games at once, do you make moves in all games per turn? or choose a single game to make a move in?
 eulerscheZahl: up to you to make the rules
 eulerscheZahl: or just generate a new set of rules every time a game is played. and pass it to the bots in some standardized way
 Muppitfood: Anyone know why coders strike back have so many more entries than the other competitions?
 eulerscheZahl: because it's the onboarding game
 darkhorse64: It's called General Game Playing
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't know the exact term
 eulerscheZahl: i know that aCat is interested in that field
 BlaiseEbuth: That's cool. I worked a little on it.
 darkhorse64: A meta language that describes the game and some hints. I think Ludii is an GGP example
 BlaiseEbuth: But you don't play multiple games at once. You just get the game rules as inputs.
 darkhorse64: You need a meta bot to understand rules and play the games

 mrs.kind: hello
 eulerscheZahl: Magic count of numbersI just generated all the valid numbers by adding prime factors. but there's another way. search for "principle of inclusion and exclusion"
 littlebear: hi mrs
 mrs.kind: how are you lilbear?
 eulerscheZahl: wait nvm. I used that principle too
 littlebear: i am fine thanks, how you doing
 ProCoder03: Yeah.. I am doing it by using sets and generating numbers but I get out of memory error 
 mrs.kind: eh, i punched a brick wall and a tree
 littlebear: haha
 ProCoder03: Is there a wiki on that ...
 mrs.kind: i isnt mad
 MiyamuraIzumi: hello guys
 mrs.kind: i was just calm
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/inclusion-exclusion.html">https://cp-algorithms.com/combinatorics/inclusion-exclusion.html</a>
 ProCoder03: Thanks eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: and for another basic question: "how many numbers &lt;= 10 are divisible by 3?"
 MiyamuraIzumi: if we have solver in MCTS then we will change selection so that it will include the solve flag (I use flag to marked a node as solved)
 eulerscheZahl: 10/3 = 3 (rounded down). So you can count them without enumerating
 eulerscheZahl: that's all you need to know
 MiyamuraIzumi: so that it will always select the win-node and don't select the lose node
 ProCoder03: Ohhh.... That sounds easy...
 MiyamuraIzumi: am I correct?
 mrs.kind: should i change my username?
 ProCoder03: no need mrs.kind
 mrs.kind: why?
 ProCoder03: but if you want to, you can
 eulerscheZahl: also there's an easy version of the puzzle you are facing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">https://projecteuler.net/problem=1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the famous first puzzle of project euler, that can be solved with pencil and paper
 darkhorse64: MiyamuraIzumi: why select a solved node&#160;? It will not learn you anything new
 eulerscheZahl: because it affects the stats of the parent node?
 MiyamuraIzumi: but we know that this node is solved right?
 ProCoder03: Ohh... I remember solving it, but by using C#..
 mrs.kind: i have like 4 accounts on this website
 eulerscheZahl: i have only 1
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl
 ProCoder03: OMG!!
 mrs.kind: dont ask me what their names are
 ProCoder03: 4 acc., for what&#160;??
 darkhorse64: If you have already solved children, you'd better solve others so that you can solve the node
 mrs.kind: i have alot of account for things
 darkhorse64: Unless one child is a Win, which means the node is a Loss and that you do not need to solve the other children
 mrs.kind: plus if ya guys and girls knew my account they'll prob ban me again
 mrs.kind: anyway i just got done with coders strike back
 PureDay: so ur that
 PureDay: eve.ha.hooves person?
 ProCoder03: Okay if I have 3 primes, then I have to divide the no for 3! acc. to inclusion and exclusion principle, how do we do it&#160;?? 
 mrs.kind: nope never heard of eve.ha.hooves
 mrs.kind: who is eve.ha.hooves?
 BlaiseEbuth: Lel

 BlaiseEbuth: Hello him
 mrs.kind: there is "him"
 mrs.kind: fitting name if i say so myself
 BlaiseEbuth: You could at least try to look like different when you create a new account eve...
 BlaiseEbuth: * mrs.kind
 mrs.kind: eh, i would be lying then
 BlaiseEbuth: Friendly advice for your next one
 IndecisionTree: I, for one, think the fake mustache and cheap sunglasses look *great* Mrs. Kind.
 IndecisionTree: stick with it
 mrs.kind: fine fine, im gonna code, i learned how to code AI
 Astrobytes: So mrs.kind, would you like to be banned right now or later?
 mrs.kind: use my name that i told you dude
 struct: which name?
 mrs.kind: not any of the usernames i had
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, good advice! Next time take a screenshoot of a drawing of sunglasses and mustache eve!
 mrs.kind: when i first came here i said "call me kayla"
 Astrobytes: Funnily enough, no one was listening.
 BlaiseEbuth: Eve said that, yes. So you admit you're eve?
 mrs.kind: never said i was isnt
 littlebear: * mrs kind
 darkhorse64: can we talk about coding and games&#160;? This convo is boring and pointless
 Astrobytes: Banned again.

 PatrickMcGinnisII: got 100% on bulls and cows 2... wow, I overcomplicated it to begin with.
 MSmits: darkhorse64 I think I made mcts hashing work for yavalath now. a definite improvement
 MSmits: I had it before but never saw much gain, but now it's pretty good
 MSmits: the trick is when you insert, you check stored hashed result against the current turn's starting board and if the starting board contains hexes that are not in the stored spot, you can safely overwrite them. That way you dont need a large hash array
 MSmits: so I store the child index and childcount of a parent node when i expand and then when i expand a new one, i check if i already have it and if so, use the same index/count
 <b>**MSmits ramble mode off</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: this should work well for any mcts game with many transpositions and/or large branching
 PatrickMcGinnisII: keep talking, something might stick...my 39th ain't so bad...considering
 MSmits: ok, well I also added some pruning. In the very late game you have some filler moves that are equivalent or provably useless. I prune those
 MSmits: reduces branching
 MSmits: on forced moves I continue expanding
 MSmits: no need to do a rollout
 MSmits: in fact, i do this on any parent with 1 child. 
 MSmits: I don't store them in my hash table either
 MSmits: those are mostly my new tricks
 MSmits: altogether I solve 3-4 plies sooner on games that fill the board
 MSmits: (around ply 41-42 on a game that goes to 61)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can you aply that to the powerball lottery, it's over $400M atm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pick a number from 1 to 26
 PatrickMcGinnisII: anyone?
 struct: 24
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx
 struct: When will you submit MSmits?
 MSmits: I might submit within a day or two a version with no book, just to test for bugs
 MSmits: but it will probably be 6th or so.
 MSmits: solving sooner and playing lategames better does not help WR much if you fall to traps in early game
 MSmits: I also realized I can supervised-learn a NN for Yavalath
 MSmits: the mcts goes quite deep and I can round unsolved nodes to wins/losses if they have enough visits
 MSmits: the meta mcts i mean
 MSmits: so I might try that as well, I was going to do this for oware also. Either way is a good test
 MSmits: book + NN could be deadly combo... in theory.
 struct: yeah
 struct: but you would have to train the nn after the book move right?
 struct: or do you still train from the start?
 MSmits: hmm, that sounds more like an azero type training
 MSmits: no i just mean a value training. I have a bunch of gamestates, i know they are wins, losses or draws and i just train the NN to output the right value
 MSmits: it's just a plain list of states and values
 struct: if you force it to output always that move isnt it a book?
 MSmits: no, i dont force it to output a move
 MSmits: i force it to output a value
 struct: ah
 MSmits: 1 = win, 0 = loss
 MSmits: i try to make it output what my meta mcts and its solver come up with
 MSmits: then in the bot i can use this output instead of a mcts rollout result
 MSmits: it might be off somewhat, but it's a big old average anyways
 MiyamuraIzumi: I just forget for somehow
 MSmits: which is why you need enough rollouts still
 MiyamuraIzumi: How can I print message to screen&#160;?
 MSmits: which language?
 MiyamuraIzumi: C++
 MSmits: error output or game output?
 MSmits: game turn output
 MiyamuraIzumi: game output
 MiyamuraIzumi: game turn
 MSmits: cout &lt;&lt; "this is output" &lt;&lt; endl
 MSmits: with a&#160;; at the end
 MiyamuraIzumi: I mean the message that show on screen
 MSmits: that's different for each game
 MiyamuraIzumi: not the one that intruct the bot
 BlaiseEbuth: cout &lt;&lt; "instructions" &lt;&lt; "msg" &lt;&lt;endl;
 MSmits: well that wont work
 MSmits: you need a space
 MSmits: "instructionsmsg"
 MSmits: but it's not fixed, it depends on the game, some games dont even have it
 MSmits: you cant use messaging in oware for example
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am trying on UTTT
 MSmits: UTTT has it yeah, lemme check
 struct: for uttt is just a space
 MSmits: ah ok
 struct: 3 3 hello
 MiyamuraIzumi: I see thanks
 MSmits: I always use the msg to output solved results
 MSmits: win/loss/draw etc.
 struct: I dont
 struct: my bot is shy
 MSmits: it's nice, people who are debugging their bot can test against mine to see if their solver is correct
 MSmits: and also when mine has a bug, they can tell me&#160;:)
 MiyamuraIzumi: well my bot lose quite some game, I need to see my score with those game
 MSmits: yeah msg is fine for that
 MSmits: I also like it to debug a sim
 BlaiseEbuth: To sell cars too
 MSmits: and to troll
 MiyamuraIzumi: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: And sing
 MiyamuraIzumi: initially, the first msg I use is to print some dummy eval score
 MiyamuraIzumi: at that time I also don't know any bot algorithm
 MiyamuraIzumi: print as I know a lot :D
 MSmits: I recommend learning minimax. It's easy to understand and not much code
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am still mess up with MCTS solver
 struct: can be tricky
 MSmits: Are you 100% sure your bot plays perfectly without it?
 struct: and the code that is in the paper doesnt help
 MSmits: if you already have bugs, adding a solver is going to make things really hard
 MiyamuraIzumi: how to sure with MCTS?
 MiyamuraIzumi: it works good
 MiyamuraIzumi: that's my point
 MSmits: it's a legend bot?
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes
 struct: this is my solver
 MSmits: ah ok, then it's probably fine yeah

 MiyamuraIzumi: thanks
 MSmits: mmh that can be optimized a bit struct
 MiyamuraIzumi: the point is, I optimize my bot a lot, then when adding solver I have to modify it
 MiyamuraIzumi: but I don't understand solver much
 MSmits: but it's more important that it works, in MiyamuraIzumi's case
 MiyamuraIzumi: so I mess up
 MSmits: what part do you find hard to understand?
 struct: yeah msmits i can probably exit early if child status = 0
 MSmits: also you dont really need to count
 MSmits: you can just keep the best status
 MSmits: and negate it for the parent
 struct: hmm
 MSmits: well that is, if you have a 0 symmetric status, you would have to do 2-status or something
 struct: maybe ill get 4M rollouts
 struct: :p
 MSmits: nah, this is not a bottleneck
 struct: I know
 MiyamuraIzumi: As I understand, If I found a leaf node with direct win/lose/draw this node is solved, then I check with following:
 MiyamuraIzumi: if the node is win =&gt; it's parent is lose
 MSmits: correct
 BlaiseEbuth: Make children...
 MiyamuraIzumi: if the node is lose/draw =&gt; I check all of the siblings, if all of them are lose/draw =&gt; parent is lose/draw - else propagate normally
 struct: yes
 MSmits: if 1 is draw and all others are loss, parent is draw
 struct: ^
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes, I do like that
 MSmits: only if all are loss, parent is win
 MSmits: if a single node is unsolved, you stop solving
 MSmits: except of course when the newly solved child is a win, then the others dont matter
 MiyamuraIzumi: newly solved child is a win
 MSmits: well that counts for every step in the solving, wins and losses will alternate, assuming there is no draw
 MSmits: so any situation where a child is a win, you can immedately make parent a loss
 MiyamuraIzumi: I think my solver is correct for this
 MSmits: then the problem might be in the calling of the function
 MSmits: when you use it
 MiyamuraIzumi: in back propagation
 MSmits: I don't do that
 MSmits: that's a separate step for me
 MSmits: completely unrelated
 MSmits: in most bots i either back prop win/loss stats or i do the solver thing
 MSmits: but sometimes i do both, but then i still prefer doing it separately
 MSmits: this method of using the solver until it stops and then building the backprop on top of that is very messy and bug-prone
 MiyamuraIzumi: I see
 MiyamuraIzumi: assume that the part of propation is correct
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d6ecf08-56dc-4831-a2d4-5e65a2048254">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3d6ecf08-56dc-4831-a2d4-5e65a2048254</a>
 MiyamuraIzumi: for checking a node directly win/lose
 MSmits: thats my backprop for yavalath
 MSmits: normal stats backprop, no solver
 MSmits: this is solver:

 MSmits: neither function is calling the other
 MiyamuraIzumi: actually, I use UCT
 MSmits: how do you mean?
 MSmits: I mean I use UCT too, but not for backprop or solving
 MiyamuraIzumi: and for some reason, I compute the "mean" value and upper bound and store on the node
 struct: MiyamuraIzumi you should benchmark your code
 struct: to find  the bottleneck
 MSmits: I don't store much on the node
 MSmits: node:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/73226b46-e5bf-4f52-b485-e5ddd14ac9ab">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/73226b46-e5bf-4f52-b485-e5ddd14ac9ab</a>
 MSmits: that's Yavalath, but uttt is similar
 MiyamuraIzumi: well, so I have to change much
 MSmits: small nodes are beneficial. I mean it's a tradeoff, sometimes it's good to save more of the gamestate on the node, so you dont have to recalc during selection
 MSmits: don't let us tell you what to do. Just try small things and gradually change how you do things as you learn
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes, I do it to avoid recalculate
 MSmits: we're just showing you alternative ways to do things. Some we havent benchmarked properly. Well except struct, but he's special
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank you, I will try with this new way
 struct: math operations are fast
 struct: I would not trade some bytes for few math operations
 MSmits: yeah it depends on how many math ops
 MSmits: especially if an applied sim move contains loops and conditions
 MiyamuraIzumi: I think the log and sqrt are slow
 MiyamuraIzumi: so that's why I store them
 MSmits: the log is negligible
 MSmits: it only is used for the parent
 MSmits: so you calc it once and pass it to each child
 struct: But you store them each individually? 
 struct: I know some people store the uct
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes
 struct: but storing log sqrt and other stuff
 struct: is very expensive
 MSmits: mostly because it takes up memory and that loses you cache efficiency
 MiyamuraIzumi: my node worth 42 bytes each
 MSmits: my nodes are usually 16 to 24
 MSmits: sometimes a little higher
 MSmits: with small nodes you also stand a better chance to reuse more of your tree
 MiyamuraIzumi: well, so I do a lot of wrong thing
 struct: its not "wrong"
 MSmits: I wouldnt say wrong. There is little stuff you can do to improve. 
 struct: my first mcts was also wrong
 MSmits: pretty sure if i show my code to struct, he will see problems and i will see problems with his
 MSmits: every mcts i ever did was "wrong" to some extent. I hope they got less wrong over time&#160;:)
 struct: maybe he does expansion like i used to do
 struct: for every move i make i would expand
 MSmits: thats a common mistake
 MSmits: but i dont think he does that
 MiyamuraIzumi: another thing
 MiyamuraIzumi: I declare a global array of 1'000'000 node
 MiyamuraIzumi: then reuse this array
 MiyamuraIzumi: is this correct way of pre allocate at the startup time?
 struct: I do
 MiyamuraIzumi: thank you all, I will try another way
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e82a60ab-26ef-4582-bb85-5a6c77bb528e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e82a60ab-26ef-4582-bb85-5a6c77bb528e</a>
 MSmits: yeah, but 1 million is very few
 MiyamuraIzumi: it is still 42Mbytes
 struct: well if have access to 768
 struct: on uttt 1M wont be enough for first turn
 struct: you have access*
 MiyamuraIzumi: should I pre allocate more?
 struct: if you need space
 struct: I reserve 45M just to be safe
 MiyamuraIzumi: MEMORY_PTR = (MEMORY_PTR + 1)&#160;% OBJ_SIZE;	return &amp;MEMORY[MEMORY_PTR];
 MiyamuraIzumi: I do something like this
 struct: whats that?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I preallocate 1000'000 nodes
 struct: ah with the way i posted above you dont need any of that
 MiyamuraIzumi: then if the node more than  1000'000 -&gt; I modulo to go back to node 0
 BlaiseEbuth: So much space. Need to see it all. OO
 BlaiseEbuth: What's your favorite thing about space? Mine is space.
 BlaiseEbuth: Space...
 BlaiseEbuth: Ba! Ba! Ba ba ba! Space!
 BlaiseEbuth: I love space.
 MSmits: preallocation:
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 MSmits: Node nodes[NODE_MAX];
 MSmits: that's it
 MSmits: wont fit that many with a large node, but 10 million should be fine
 BlaiseEbuth: Come here, space. I have a secret for you. No, come closer.
 MSmits: when did BlaiseEbuth last get reset? Someone forget to do it?
 BlaiseEbuth: Look, an eclipse! No. Don't look.
 Wontonimo: How's the solver going MiyamuraIzumi&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi: well ...
 MiyamuraIzumi: not so good
 Wontonimo: oh

 ZarthaxX: i wont be able to be here until end of semester tbh haha
 struct: sorry to hear that
 ZarthaxX: yeah, pretty traumatic
 ZarthaxX: last week was horrible
 struct: feel free to message me if you need
 ZarthaxX: i can tell you
 ZarthaxX: it's already over tho
 ZarthaxX: i will pm you on discord a bit
 struct: ok
 ZarthaxX: gotta continue studying later for a final exam
 Wontonimo: :wave: ZarthaxX good to see you.  Good luck with uni and stuff
 ZarthaxX: hey wontoo
 ZarthaxX: thankkkkss
 ZarthaxX: &lt;3
 ZarthaxX: this game theory subject allows us to do some final presentation with algorithms
 ZarthaxX: guy says we could talk about alphazero
 ZarthaxX: pity i cant talk about that thing lmao
 Wontonimo: MCTS is(was?) a huge part of alphazero.  The UCB calculation is pretty impressive in combining weak classifiers in a tree (random rollout being the weakest)
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: maybe i could try reading about it for some presentation but seems impossible for december
 ZarthaxX: haha
 Wontonimo: you've used MCTS right?
 ZarthaxX: yeah, have done bots with that
 ZarthaxX: working bots lmao
 Wontonimo: that's all i'm suggesting.  a focus on UCT, the UCB formula, and that many things can be put in for the eval, like a random rollout or a NN
 ZarthaxX: but i have to do a NN
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: oh
 ZarthaxX: never done those
 ZarthaxX: i mean, isnt it the thing?
 Wontonimo: no
 ZarthaxX: anyway, prob i can find any other topic
 ZarthaxX: maybe some paper about mcts solver
 Wontonimo: i say that and my job is nn
 ZarthaxX: thing is to talk about a paper
 Wontonimo: ah
 ZarthaxX: but i find it cool to talk about a paper and implement stuff
 ZarthaxX: or a chapter form this book
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F13/algorithmic-game-theory.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F13/algorithmic-game-theory.pdf</a>
 ZarthaxX: haha
 Wontonimo: nice paper
 Wontonimo: book
 Wontonimo: don't get me wrong, NN is awesome.  I'm not discounting it.  I do love it.  But it has it's place and often a classic machine learning algorithm fits the problem very nicely
 ZarthaxX: wdym by this? " a classic machine learning algorithm fits the problem very nicely"
 Wontonimo: a classic machine learning algorithm is something like auto-clustering, or K-means, or support vectors.  They can solve a ton of problems without getting into NNs

 MSmits: hi
 raizbro: bear wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
 littlebear: you have been warned
 Astrobytes: he was warned and kicked
 MSmits: hi Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits
 MSmits: are you working on anything for CG?
 MSmits: Or just keeping the channel clean?
 Astrobytes: Not at the moment, killing time before my 2nd covid jab (eventually)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: why did it take so long for you to get it?
 MSmits: I was pretty late myself and it was almost 2 months ago
 Astrobytes: Had to push the date back due to having covid 
 MSmits: oh right thats it
 MSmits: you sample all viruses first, before getting the vaccins
 Astrobytes: Naturally! :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: well it's professional interest I'm sure
 Astrobytes: Nah. I'm just extremely unlucky. It's a well known feature about me  :P
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: I did run length encoding with students today
 Astrobytes: Cool, how did they find it?
 MSmits: they had to draw pictures from encodings
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: and then they had to invent their own picture and turn it into encoding
 MSmits: saw a lot of different male members today
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: Teens will be teens
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: but in this case it's mostly my colleague's fault
 Astrobytes: lol why?
 MSmits: he will make a point of walking into my classroom at the right moment and whisper some stuff at them
 Astrobytes: Hah! My kind of colleague
 MSmits: hehe yea it's oik
 MSmits: he also rickrolls them
 MSmits: he uploaded several files of the same sound but varying sample rate
 MSmits: but they were all rickrolls
 Astrobytes: superb
 MSmits: then when it's testing time he makes a link "answers to the test here"...
 Astrobytes: That's great. Wish my teachers had been master trolls like that
 MSmits: hehe yeah it's kind of funny
 MSmits: I have a sense of humor, but I don't naturally troll students
 MSmits: I can enjoy it when he does though
 Astrobytes: You should. Just a little.
 Astrobytes: Like once a week or something
 MSmits: I'll think about it&#160;:)
 MSmits: hey, I am confused about something with covid
 Astrobytes: Gives you enough time to come up with something good
 MSmits: maybe you have thoughts
 Astrobytes: Go on
 MSmits: how come in the  US they have 30k young children hospitalized with covid and here in my country there are no restrictions at all in priomary schools and they do ok
 Astrobytes: Bigger population for starters
 MSmits: well sure, but 30k is a LOT still
 BlaiseEbuth: Bigger people
 Astrobytes: What's the geographical distribution of the 30K?
 MSmits: it's of course going to be mostly in states with lower vaccination rates
 MSmits: but still, we've been told it's mostly harmless for children
 Astrobytes: Yes. They also have generally few if any restrictions, so who knows which variant they have.
 MSmits: hmm so you're thinking it's not the same delta variant over there?
 Astrobytes: I think it's just as harmful, but kids are a bit more resilient. Plus these kind of viruses will sweep through certain demographics of the population every wave
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: I'm not up to date on the current variants, there are quite a few floating around
 MSmits: I'm a bit worried we're going to see massive waves going through primary schools here at some point
 Astrobytes: It's happening here
 MSmits: oh?
 Astrobytes: No one appears to care though
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: physically weaker kids go to different kinds of schools here where they are more careful
 MSmits: In the US the person with Down syndrom goes to the same school
 MSmits: this does not help
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we've got a huge school for kids with special requirements and whatnot here, serves the whole area. They're very careful too.
 MSmits: anyways, that was my question, train is arriving, ttyl&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Definitely agree with you.
 Astrobytes: Later man
 MiyamuraIzumi: well, we could just see, covid as a new normal soon
 MiyamuraIzumi: so people all around the world will accustom to it
 MiyamuraIzumi: we might need to vaccinate yearly
 Astrobytes: Yeah it will be like that, it'll take some time to settle down though. So much of the world is still dealing with huge numbers of cases
 Astrobytes: Yes, most probably.
 ProCoder03: Wait in your country primary students started doing to school daily&#160;?? 
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 TimothyAlexisVass: Updated this now:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7308d63b764bf1979ade0e862fcb636fa0f4">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7308d63b764bf1979ade0e862fcb636fa0f4</a>
 ProCoder03: Wow!! Ours is the one that's lagging behind :disappointed:
 Astrobytes: That and our prime minister is a shockingly bad excuse for a human being.
 ProCoder03: We are still having alternative days school and that too only for 13+
 ProCoder03: lol
 MiyamuraIzumi: covid is still in high, I don't think we should let children go to school for now
 Astrobytes: It's a tough balance between ruining kids education and hospitalising them with a potentially deadly virus I guess
 ProCoder03: yeah..
 MiyamuraIzumi: :white_check_mark
 MiyamuraIzumi: :white_check_mark:
 TimothyAlexisVass: Is there some trick to sum the digits in a number?
 Astrobytes: Use / and&#160;%
 TimothyAlexisVass: Hmm?&#160;:\
 TimothyAlexisVass: Let's say I have N=1375411+3+7+5+4+1 = 21
 TimothyAlexisVass: In Ruby you can split it and use inject.
 TimothyAlexisVass: In Javascript you can split it and use reduce
 Husoski: If you keep summing, though, repeating the digit sum until you get a single digit sum, then you get either 0 or (n-1)%9 +1.
 raizbro: shtrj
 TimothyAlexisVass: JS:s=N.split``.reduce((a,b)=&gt;a+b)
 Astrobytes: bye bye raizbro
 TimothyAlexisVass: Hmm that won't be correct though.
 TimothyAlexisVass: s=N.split``.reduce((a,b)=&gt;+a+~~b)
 TimothyAlexisVass: Otherwise it will do string concatenation of the numbers...
 gugrbywitkr: timothyalexisvass there's trick
 gugrbywitkr: eval([...s].join`+`)
 gugrbywitkr: if you are working on number you have to make it str firsst
 gugrbywitkr: so its eval([...<i>+n].join`+`)</i>
 gugrbywitkr: eval is evaluating str as javascript would 
 gugrbywitkr: so eval('1+2') is 3 
 gugrbywitkr: so you do [...<i>+152].join`+` and you get '1+5+2'</i>
 TimothyAlexisVass: gugrbywitkr! Thanks, that was clevereval([...s].join`+`)
 gugrbywitkr: we can private clash and exchange js tricks
 TimothyAlexisVass: OK

 Nektar24: guys i love programming , but i hate sitting down on a chair , as a result i haven't programmed all summer , what do i do&#160;? :disappointed:
 Nektar24: my back and my butt hurt from all the quaranteen sitting down
 Wontonimo: stand
 Wontonimo: kneel
 Nektar24: i can kneel for maybe 10 minutes but then what :grin:
 Nektar24: maybe i'm sitting down wrong
 dreadylein: get a decent char and try to sit properly&#160;;) aside of that, standing is actually not a joke if you got problems with your back
 Wontonimo: my most productive programming is 15-25 min sitting, stand up, pace around while thinking of next steps, sit down and repeat
 dreadylein: just make sure to increase the height of the monitor and keyboard accordingly
 Wontonimo: i've been asked how I get so much done at work when I seem to be walking around so much.  it works for me
 Nektar24: i see alright
 Nektar24: thanks&#160;!
 Wontonimo: that kind of routine can also really help you keep your changes in manageably small chunks that are self contained
 Wontonimo: when sitting down it's all about focus in the small self-contained change that can be completed in 15-25 min.  When standing up it's all about planning the next change and thinking higher level
 NotGoodatall: hi guys um what is the best programming language :neutral_face:
 ProCoder03: every language is both superior and inferior to all other programming langauge
 NotGoodatall: Ok ill use JavaScript i'm better with that one .  
 TimothyAlexisVass: ProCoder ...
 ProCoder03: yes..
 MeBen: He ain't wrong
 NotGoodatall: MeBen what is your rank?
 ProCoder03: hover hover his dp
 MeBen: No idea, either 13 or 9276?
 ProCoder03: the later is your rank
 ProCoder03: first is your level
 NotGoodatall: im 10,077
 NotGoodatall: and im level 4
 ProCoder03: it shows you are 38000s

 NotGoodatall: :zipper_mouth:
 NotGoodatall: i'm not good at programming
 MeBen: Practice makes perfect&#160;:)
 NotGoodatall: yea
 TimothyAlexisVass: How do I get 2 space separated integers into 2 variables with Ruby?
 TimothyAlexisVass: in Python it'sa,b=map(int,input().split(' '))
 MeBen: There's several ways, the most straight-forward would be `a, b = gets.split.map &amp;:to_i`
 TimothyAlexisVass: Is that the shortest?
 TimothyAlexisVass: a,b=gets.split.map &amp;:to_i
 struct: I guess so
 MeBen: It depends on how many inputs there are, and if they're on the same line, etc. You can also use the special $_ variable when gets is used, things like `gets;p $_.to_i+$_[~/ /].to_i`
 TimothyAlexisVass: :S
 TimothyAlexisVass: :open_mouth:
 MeBen: Ruby had a lot of influence from Perl
 struct: also if you want to read entire input you can use `dd`
 MeBen: Yep, `dd` is a good trick, and also $&lt;.map to map/iterate over lines of input
 TimothyAlexisVass: So it's 1 line with 2 space separated integers
 MeBen: Can also use eval, i.e. to sum all numbers in a line you can do `p eval(gets.tr ' ',?+)`
 TimothyAlexisVass: Has anyone used Ruby in their profession?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Let me rephrase taht
 TimothyAlexisVass: Has anyone here (enjoyed) using Ruby in their profession?&#160;;)
 MeBen: A little bit now and then
 TimothyAlexisVass: We use Redmine here
 MeBen: A lot of Ruby is in Rails and I don't do web dev
 ProCoder03: MeBen, Is there any good ruby course you would suggest
 MeBen: There's _why's poignant guide, but that's more of a story than a guide
 MeBen: Other than that I can't really remember, it's been too long

 MeBen: The problem statement needs work, it doesn't say anywhere what operations are allowed, that there's parentheses, etc. 
 MeBen: It sucks when you have to look at test cases because statements aren't exhaustive.
 BlaiseEbuth: And a summary of the roman system would be good
 MeBen: Is that not assumed to be common knowledge?
 5922: Probably not to the extent required.
 BlaiseEbuth: Furthermore, there's the Roman's roman system, and the medieval roman system. With some differences between
 TimothyAlexisVass: I'll add some details. I think it's also nice to be able to copy the numbers from the Statement.
 Wontonimo: Hey TimothyAlexisVass, have you solved this using c, c++, or rust?  Is it reasonable to solve this in 15 min using one of those languages?
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't see anything thar could be a problem in these languages
 Wontonimo: I'm not c/c++/rust expert, but a huge part of your solution is using "eval" that does all the heavy lifting of parsing the order of operations and that doesn't exist in those languages
 TimothyAlexisVass: Good point.
 Wontonimo: "( I + II ) * IV / III"without "eval" will require a lot more work in c/c++ compared to the published solution in python
 TimothyAlexisVass: especially with the parenthesis.
 Wontonimo: it's doable, it's just not clash sized for all languages

 Miki09: In cb silver league what is the max speed of pod? The pods thrust is from 0 to 100 but it moves about 500 pixels each turn.
 Miki09: *csb
 Illedan: What is the friction again?
 Illedan: 0.2*500 =&gt; 100. So you can't drive faster
 eulerscheZahl: BOOST
 eulerscheZahl: isn't friction 0.15?
 Miki09: But i take my previous position and my position now and the distance method returns about 500
 BlaiseEbuth: Thrust is added to the speed vector, it's not the speed itself.
 Miki09: So what's the max speed of pod?
 BlaiseEbuth: On each turn the pods movements are computed this way: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aea70005-9223-483b-b070-1ac595633f57">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aea70005-9223-483b-b070-1ac595633f57</a>

 Wontonimo: hey Miki09 , nice Coders Strikes Back silver bot.  What's your next idea for improvement?
 Wontonimo: Miki09, you are using shields when speeding to the next checkpoint.  Shields also stop your pod dead in it's tracks, so not the best when speeding to a checkpoint
 tealfrog: I got a guy in clash who made exactly same code in short. Looks unlucky to name even vars the same. Is there place to report it?Someone checking use of double account?

 struct: They cant handle them
 Wontonimo: are you getting on the NN wagon?
 struct: yes

 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 Wontonimo: about the time China and US and SpaceX are planning on having a person return to the moon
 struct: Yeah ill have to write a NN to bring them back
 Wontonimo: that sounds like a multi or solo.  kinda like a reverse mars lander, but only allowed to use NN (not code)
 Wontonimo: "The orbiter transport has crashed.  You have to grow potatoes for 3 months (90 game frames) then drive to the launchpoint, lift off, and do an orbital docking"

 Wontonimo: "with the replacement transport"
 Astrobytes: with a touch of The Martian
 mr_ayush_kumawat: Hey there
 struct: Does mcts work for 3+ player games?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but I think you have to incorporate things like paranoid, maxN, best-reply, all that kinda stuff depending on the game
 Astrobytes: Never tried it myself
 MiyamuraIzumi: mcts can also even work for 1 player game
 Astrobytes: There are papers out there on it
 Wontonimo: if you lose, it's very sad
 MiyamuraIzumi: isn't that 1 player game always lead to a lose?
 Wontonimo: for multi player that is just 1 winner and multiple losers,  you could have a backprop that is +1 for the winner and -1/(players-1) for the losers.  I bet that would be okay and result in about a zero score for near tie games
 struct: yeah but tron is kinda a different story
 struct: sometimes you are not even competing vs some players
 MiyamuraIzumi: apart from doing bot programming, do you guy have any idea on what to do in freetime?
 Astrobytes: Perhaps try the paranoid approach struct, maybe EPT with floodfill heuristic
 struct: paranoid = closest right?
 Astrobytes: Assume all players are out to get you
 struct: yeah my bot does that
 struct: for 1 ply
 struct: ill try 1vs1 mcts to see how it does
 Wontonimo: MiyamuraIzumi , I hear some people bath.  That can take upwards of 14 minutes
 struct: baths or showers?
 Astrobytes: I like both tbh
 Wontonimo: at the same time?
 Astrobytes: baths in winter, showers in summer
 struct: I do some sports too, but not everyone can
 struct: I do cycling, swimming, running, football
 Astrobytes: Actually, I have really long hair so I do use the shower in the bath when I'm washing it
 MiyamuraIzumi: well do some execercise/sport seems good
 Astrobytes: Do whatever you want&#160;:)
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: write a program to generate ideas
 MiyamuraIzumi: oh
 Astrobytes: NN it. Consult it every morning on daily plans.
 Wontonimo: and then write another to generate excuses

 struct: minimax voronoi?
 Wontonimo: and eval being floodfill area controlled - opponent area?
 YurkovAS: That’s why I use the MCTS more and more frequently on Codingame: Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (2 players), Tron (4 players), Mars Lander (optimzation)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/xmash-rush-cc07-feedback-strategies/74346/38">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/xmash-rush-cc07-feedback-strategies/74346/38</a>
 Astrobytes: Yes and yes
 jrke: while minimaxing with nearest opp do you switch opponent in between if it becomes more nearer than the first opponent?
 Astrobytes: You would presumably check who is closest every turn yes
 Astrobytes: Oh, during minimaxing... hm, no
 eulerscheZahl: ^
 MiyamuraIzumi: MCTS for MarLander YurkovAS?
 Wontonimo: i can image that would work
 Astrobytes: The reason you choose the closest is because they are the most immediate threat. 
 eulerscheZahl: minimax vs furthest only :thinking:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: You can use SP-MCTS for other optimisation problems too
 eulerscheZahl: DerRadikaleRusse was experimenting with paranoidand predicted that one opponent would commit suicide so the other can survive longer
 jrke: my current tron bot leaves lot space like closing lot space which can't be visited
 Astrobytes: No one says you have to fill all the space, as long as you win
 eulerscheZahl: when you are cut off from the others, there's some nice graph theory to use
 jrke: whats that theory?
 Astrobytes: chambers and articulation points and stuff iirc
 YurkovAS: MiyamuraIzumi 68placebut i'm was same with GA (online)
 eulerscheZahl: Superstrukturgraph (no idea how to translate)yes, related to articulation points
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;:)
 jacek: graph theory eh
 Wontonimo: to get started in Tron, just turn if you are about to hit a wall
 eulerscheZahl: the thing that struct hates
 struct: i know very little about graphs
 Astrobytes: I knew very little about graphs before CG
 Astrobytes: Just some basic concepts
 jacek: Superstrukturgraph? is this Supergraph?
 Astrobytes: Yes iirc, we had to translate this once before when euler used the same word

 jacek: good for you, but non-clash people cant see the question or solutions
 Gvinfinity: oh, is there a way I can share that?
 jacek: manual copy paste
 Astrobytes: Or just be happy with "well done!"
 sirsatan: i guess it was difficult
 Astrobytes: Judging by the times and success rate yes, or the others were simply feeble
 Wontonimo: or the clash was hard
 Astrobytes: See post above mine&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: And well done anyway Gvinfinity
 Wontonimo: hey Gvinfinity, there is more to CG than clash.  Have you tried the puzzles or bot battles?
 Wontonimo: oh, i see you have tried a bot battle :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: Work is boring today Wontonimo?&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: it sure is Astro
 jacek: isnt it always
 Astrobytes: Here: :taco:
 Wontonimo: you know me well
 Wontonimo: thanks :D
 jacek: i see robo overtook me in bt :F
 jacek: i take holidays for 5 days and this is what happens
 eulerscheZahl: holidays from CG?
 eulerscheZahl: good thing you are back tomorrow to wish us a happy Caturday
 jacek: somewhat. i didnt take bring my computer
 jacek: my grammar is so advanced since then
 Wontonimo: your saying texting is very good decent 
 omboyo: anyone here who has done ray tracing?
 omboyo: ray casting*
 Wontonimo: yes
 struct: last time I heard about it someone wanted to solve space maze with it
 Astrobytes: ahhh the ray-tracing NN
 omboyo: how do you get the distance not from the ray to P, but from the frame to P?
 omboyo: im trying to solve a simple ascii 3d engine
 darkhorse64: you want the distance from the origin to the point touched by the ray&#160;?
 omboyo: thats what ive got now i think. but I get a fisheye effect. But its says to fix that you have to calculate from "the plane of the screen".<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/ray-casting-diagram.jpg">https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/ray-casting-diagram.jpg</a>. exsampel the screen in this photo
 Astrobytes: So from the camera plane
 Husoski: dot product with the direction vector (unit vector perpendicular to the screen)
 darkhorse64: if you have a fisheye effect, it's likely that you are not using a perspective projection. You are doing something like direction = [angleX/resolutionX*i, angleY/resolutionY*j]
 Wontonimo: ^^ that right.  fisheye is cool, and uses angle
 Wontonimo: instead put an imaginary grid of 600x400 (or whatever your resolution is) infront of the camera.  iterate over each grid location and shoot a ray from the camera in the direction of the grid location
 Wontonimo: if the grid is 2 meter across, and it is 1 meter infront of the camera, then you'll have a 90 degree field of view
 omboyo: thanks guys i think i will get i now
 omboyo: i coulnt find much information on this. how did you guys learn?
 dreadylein: books ... iam old
 darkhorse64: i wrote my own raytracer a long time ago <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://xrt.wikidot.com">http://xrt.wikidot.com</a>
 struct: parsing inputs for tron is a mess
 struct: ...
 A_W1534: there is a city in poland called kock
 Husoski: There's a pudding in England called "spotted dick".  So what?
 Wontonimo: any new players here who need a hand?
 OTOK: :nerd:
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Wontonimo: what are you working on OTOK&#160;?
 andrefalt: i'm new
 andrefalt: This game is fun
 andrefalt: Ngl
 Wontonimo: what are you working on?
 JustinZhang: How can I identify the color in smash the code
 JustinZhang: I just random number and it is stupid
 ProCoder03: Good Morning guys!!
 Husoski: Evening, here.  Just got a fresh earthquake alert.  4.9 about 40 miles away.  Not feeling anything so far.
 zaraptwillbebeaten: scary
 ProCoder03: :scream::frowning:
 Husoski: It's been marked down to a 4.3 by USGS, so it's much smaller than the phone alert said.  I didn't feel a thing.  But if it's a pre-shock...
 ProCoder03: which area&#160;??
 Husoski: LA south bay, near Long Beach
 ProCoder03: I don't know abt LA...
 Husoski: (CA, USA)
 ProCoder03: but isn't LA close to san andreas fault
 Husoski: San Andreas is father inland, but there's lots of fault lines throughout So Cal.
 zaraptwillbebeaten: 👋
 ProCoder03: ohhh.. CA seems to be a Earthquake prone area :worried:
 littlebear: morning
 ProCoder03: morning littlebear
 littlebear:&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: are you from AP&#160;??
 littlebear: me&#160;?, no Kerala
 ProCoder03: Oh..
 Joe1014: What i can do...
 Joe1014: For coders strike back
 Joe1014: anyone help?
 MiyamuraIzumi: Hello guys
 MiyamuraIzumi: gitc

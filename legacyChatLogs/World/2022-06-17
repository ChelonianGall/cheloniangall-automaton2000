 emh: good morning
 MSmits: meurning
 Poligraph: ok boys
 Poligraph: how to code
 MSmits: is that rhetorical?
 aCat: morning MSmits&#160;:-)
 MSmits: hi aCat
 emh: this game is not so bad after all. it's probabilistic so it's suitable for heuristics. no?
 emh: and if you start with the published boss you can use arrays immediately and don't have to worry about long names haha
 MSmits: ohh i did that on my own. Did not know i could get it from boss
 emh: but then you'd have to do Java
 MSmits: it's the first thing i did, before i even understood any of the rules
 MSmits: but I agree, it seems cool
 MSmits: It is somewhat similar to locam
 MSmits: but locam had 2 problems. 1) cards were unbalanced, which killed the complexity of the game, you could just set a card order
 kovi: array? i was hesitating on bitmap instantly
 MSmits: 2) too much uncertainty
 MSmits: i dont know if this game has 1), but it does not have 2)
 MSmits: kovi how would you do a bitmap here?
 MSmits: bitboard i think you mean
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: you can have a hand with up to 5 cards of each
 MSmits: thats 3 bits times 8
 MSmits: if you include bonus its harder
 MSmits: but the bits dont necessarily makes things better because you cant shift them
 MSmits: it's still just addition
 MSmits: so the only advantage i think would be storage. If you foresee having to store millions of gamestates, then yeah
 kovi: or calculate quicker
 MSmits: not necessarily
 MSmits: why would bits be faster here?
 MSmits: sure you can subtract an app from a hand in 1 go
 MSmits: but you have to check if you're allowed first
 MSmits: and that's not doable with bit ops afaik
 MSmits: (unless you use 5 bits per card type and use 64 bit state)
 MSmits: still hard i think
 kovi: i have some ideas
 MSmits: I'm going to focus on the search algo and on figuring out a way to fit params which I will inevitably have to do
 kovi: i wonder how nn would do in this game
 MSmits: I think the question is how hard is it to come up with a working NN 
 MSmits: the input is weird and has a difficult structure
 emh: yayy I'm 29 in Bronze and all I did was change ~10 lines of boss
 MSmits: :cry:
 MSmits: I worked on it for hours last night and am 31
 kovi: hmm, did they already shared github link?
 MSmits: I guess most time is spent understanding how the game works
 emh: lazy coding ftw
 MSmits: yeah, someone will have it kovi
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle</a>
 kovi: thx
 MSmits: hey, i have a question
 MSmits: you can chain multiple coding cards right?
 MSmits: which means you can have several play phases
 MSmits: is there anyway to know from the current turn input, how many play phases are queued?
 MSmits: or do you need to keep track?
 MSmits: say you play a coding card. Another play phase happens, but it is only the first of two. So if you sim this phase, you have to know there is another
 MSmits: also, you should be able to play infinite coding cards if you have enough in your deck
 kovi: i havent checked play_card, but i guess we need to track (use state) ourselves
 MSmits: yeah, it seems a bit out of character for this game though since almost everything is given in input
 pedrosorio: they don't tell you how many throw phases you have either
 pedrosorio: also, afaict they don't tell you which turn it is in the game (?)
 MSmits: but you dont need these
 MSmits: throw is just at most 1 and only when you passed admin 
 pedrosorio: the game turn seems pretty relevant
 j4at: why is there 4 levels&#160;?
 kovi: hmm, turn might be needed
 MSmits: not really if all good games stay below 200 phases
 MSmits: all you need to know is your opponent score
 kovi: are they? (i dont know yet)
 MSmits: they are
 MSmits: if bots do well and there is no bug (like the training bug) it's usually below or near 100
 kovi: but will they? (when we also try to disrupt opponent)
 MSmits: yeah, i dont think its possible to disrupt the opponent to a sufficient degree so as to double the length of the game
 MSmits: you can influence the cards in the desk, but this just gives your opponent bonus cards
 MSmits: and you can block his desk, but this is not a major issue
 MSmits: and it's always a temporary block for which you can find workarounds
 MSmits: it's really a low interaction game
 MSmits: almost an optim, with probabilistic elements
 MSmits: oh right and of course you can take his apps, but thats happening now and is not going to change in the future i thnik
 aCat: Smits you have 2 discards when going thdough desk
 MSmits: sorry i meant the 8 type desks
 MSmits: not the admin
 aCat: and if you go via desk and enear the opponent - 3 discards in a row&#160;;]
 MSmits: i know, dont do that :P
 MSmits: train arriving, working for 4 hrs and then back to green circle&#160;:)
 MSmits: ttyl
 aCat: bb
 j4at: Iwood 2 is level 1, wood 1 is level 2 bronze is level 3? But there is 4 levels in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/tree/master/config">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/tree/master/config</a>

 pedrosorio: task prioritization action failed because I don't have a card which I do have&#160;?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/BjFdzLk">https://imgur.com/BjFdzLk</a>
 pedrosorio: funny thing is the replay never says what's wrong, just "timed out" (which is unlikely since I print at 35ms): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641723290">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641723290</a>
 MSmits: perhaps there was no 6 card in the desk and the error message is bad
 pedrosorio: I am keeping track of the cards on the desks, so that is strange but possible, I guess
 pedrosorio: I've seen the error a few times. A bit suspicious that it's always complaining about continuous integration not being available.
 pedrosorio: on turn 11 lol:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641727183">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641727183</a>

 NotSureWhyThisWorks: can someone explain why the game gets stuck in an infinite loop at around turn 64 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641729397">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641729397</a>
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I think it must be something to do with the use skill phase, I am just printing RANDOM, but I wouldn't have thought that the game would allow an infinite loop
 pedrosorio: as I suspected, there is a bug:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CommandManager.java#L238">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/CommandManager.java#L238</a>

 emh: are desk 7 and desk 0 considered to be next to each other?
 Illedan: Not in my code
 PiterYeh: yes emh
 Illedan: They are?
 PiterYeh: in my head i'm sure they are, i think i saw that in a replay last night

 PiterYeh: turn 9
 Rafarafa: does anyone know how the list of possible applications is generated at the start?
 j4at: Badly written statement&#160;:)  reading the source code is the only reasonable way to understand this.
 aCat: but the source is complicated mess
 eulerscheZahl: so is the statement&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and i have a feeling that not all bronze changes are highlighted in green
 eulerscheZahl: either that or i missed a lot while reading wood1
 Rafarafa: can't read java&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: you should appreciate that it's not Kotlin this time
 eulerscheZahl: code royale memories...
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L537">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L537</a>
 aangairbender: isnt Kotlin easy to read? I was doing code-a-la-mode recently, it was nice kotlin
 aCat: here is checking distance to opponent
 eulerscheZahl: code royale and code a la mode are from the same author
 Rafarafa: so I'm getting from the ApplicationFactory file that it just randomly pulls 12 big applications at the start from a preset database of what, 25 or so big applications?
 Rafarafa: you never get to work with small applications in bronze?
 aCat: 28
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/ApplicationFactory.java#L13">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/ApplicationFactory.java#L13</a>
 eulerscheZahl: even the promotion popup told you that all applications are big
 aCat: ids are just indexes in the table
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903337608606789755/987024511427809361/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903337608606789755/987024511427809361/unknown.png</a>
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yeah I couldn't see the highlighted differences in bronze
 aCat: you are reading the promotion popup :scream_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes. rarely
 aangairbender: Rafarafa I think those are not preset database, but actually just all possible big applications
 aangairbender: they just decided to precompute them
 aCat: random 12 from preset 28
 aCat: ids 0 to 27
 aangairbender: yes, 12 applications from all possible big applications (it just happen to be 28 in total)
 Rafarafa: I didn't remember the popup&#160;:(
 Rafarafa: ok thanks everyone
 Illedan: Uhm, I do Training and can still do TASK_PRIORITIZATION from my hand, but I just go straight to RELEASE?&#160;:/ 
 aangairbender: if no shoddy skill used why not?
 MSmits: 28 applications = (8*7) / 2?
 MSmits: it picks 12 random from these 28?
 emh: is there a way to skip the admin post? I see in replays that sometimes the player jumps past it
 MSmits: Illedan task prioritization does require a second card
 jacek: wood replays?
 aangairbender: 28 applications = C(8, 2)combinations to put 2 skills into 8 buckets
 MSmits: perhaps the new cards are not counted as possible cards to play 
 MSmits: aangairbender yeah that's 8*7/2 :P
 aangairbender: MSmits in this case infinite loop would not exist:joy:
 MSmits: we really need to study the source to know what really happens
 pedrosorio: emh you jump past the admin post if you have &lt;= 2 skill cards, there's no decision to make in that case, you just spend the cards/get the tech debt, no need to request the player for input
 MSmits: so many weird things happen
 emh: pedrosorio ahhh
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure if i want to understand or just copy the source to put it into my sim (which doesn't exist yet)
 MSmits: I want to understand and I need the sim to be c++
 aangairbender: pedrosorio statements says action will be performed automatically in this case
 pedrosorio: yep
 MSmits: which is problematic because the viewer isnt that informative
 kovi: yeah, rewrite and painful check of compare diff
 MSmits: it might have been better to let players do the phases even if there is no choice to be made
 eulerscheZahl: i just hope there won't be any significant referee changes/bugfixes
 MSmits: i hope there will be, because there's some bad bugs to fix
 eulerscheZahl: the bad one, sure
 eulerscheZahl: the infinite loop
 eulerscheZahl: at a previous contest i ported the referee. then the referee was changed. and again and again
 eulerscheZahl: botg
 aangairbender: it would be cool to see applications and automated cards in the viewer
 MSmits: yeah thats annoying
 eulerscheZahl: i still have to understand those concepts from the rules
 MSmits: viewer could just have little dots for apps, should not take up too much space
 MSmits: which concepts?
 eulerscheZahl: what's an automated card?
 MSmits: it's a card you can use for finishing apps
 eulerscheZahl: or a permanent skill card
 MSmits: but not play as a skill
 MSmits: permanent skill card is a bonus that stays until next app finish
 MSmits: it has separate input
 aangairbender: automated card is never discarded, but can be used ONLY for release
 eulerscheZahl: can there be multiple automated ones?
 aangairbender: yes
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: of any type?
 MSmits: you can use a bonus card for it
 MSmits: yes
 aangairbender: I am thinking automating bonuses it a good idea
 kovi: like nerchio did smartly
 MSmits: and Illedan
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: does an automated card get removed after a single release?
 aangairbender: seems no
 eulerscheZahl: do i see automated cards in the viewer?
 MSmits: no it doesnt
 MSmits: not sure
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: so technically you could automate all the cards you need for a release instead of waiting for them to get drawn?
 kovi: with CI yes
 MSmits: yeah, but this takes time
 MSmits: it's also a popular desk
 MSmits: so expect opponent to go there
 Illedan: Hm, I do anything smartly?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: hmm ok
 aangairbender: worker placement mechanics:sunglasses:
 MSmits: it's possible in theory Illedan
 kovi: sorry Illedan not sure who did it first, just noticed the smart use of many automated bonus
 Illedan: Ah
 Illedan: So it is better to automate bonuses?
 Illedan: :eyes:
 aangairbender: it seems so, you can use it for all releases in theory
 aangairbender: so huge value
 MSmits: should just make bots that do various things and test them
 kovi: i let the communinity do that for me&#160;:)
 MSmits: I don't think this game will have much of a "meta" as opponent influence is limited. It's more about figuring out what works.
 aangairbender: I even wanted to do paper copy of this game and play with friends a bit to understand the game better
 MSmits: also the bot needs to be flexible to deal with the available apps and the deck you've built uop
 MSmits: up
 aangairbender: maybe it's worth checking out Samsara board game. maybe best strategies can be applied here
 MSmits: depends on how different it is
 aangairbender: as it was with contest about potions
 eulerscheZahl: will automated cards disappear when i use them to build an app?
 aangairbender: they dont disappear
 kovi: that is why 2-4 bonus is uber
 eulerscheZahl: so with 8 bonus cards in auto, i can just complete one project after another and win?
 kovi: it seems
 eulerscheZahl: (if the opponent lets me get those 8 cards in the first place)
 aangairbender: with 4 bonuses you can complete any of first 4 apps
 aangairbender: need to finish without shoddy though
 kovi: yes only last need 8
 Illedan: MSmits, do you disagree with the screenshot I put on the forum?
 eulerscheZahl: that's one of the few rules i got, aangairbender
 kovi: it is hard to prevent getting bonus...
 Illedan: I should be able to do ArchStudy right?
 aangairbender: each player starts with 4 bonuses, I guess just going for CI will be nice strat
 MSmits: Illedan i havent seen it, let me look at it
 aangairbender: also TRAINING seems good, using that card give more opportunities (unless you need that card for app)
 kovi: considering these...meta might evolve
 kovi: anti-automated-bonus strat
 MSmits: IlledanI have no explanation other than bug
 MSmits: would be best if you located the bug in the source
 Illedan: I tried
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L152">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/d57c4a5659da1ff5558363b88bc5fab9cc73842d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L152</a>Maybe this?
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:thank god i'm not the creator or tester here. after reading the forum, i predict a busy day
 MSmits: canPlayActionCard(activePlayer)
 MSmits: that function should contain the bug
 aCat: so true euler...
 Illedan: They should discard the used card after it is done. For training and Coding it would solve the bugs
 Illedan: Ah
 TINOUAINANI: Hi, what should I print if I don't want to use the skill card?
 aCat: WAIT&#160;?
 MSmits: ye
 emh: ohh number of initial battles increased to 20?
 eulerscheZahl: are there mirrors?
 emh: yes seems like
 MSmits: mirrors are good
 Illedan: Makes sense
 TINOUAINANI: in PLAY_CARD phase , i don,t whant to play a card can I&#160;?
 MSmits: yes WAIT
 TINOUAINANI: thanks
 MSmits: maybe someone can go to their desk and disturb them to give them a code review card?
 Ayushman965: Hello
 Ayushman965: anybody on chess.com here?
 MSmits: our motto is: "Why play a game when you can code a bot to do it for you"
 MSmits: we have a chessbot arena though
 Ayushman965: oh
 Ayushman965: chess programming is interesting
 MSmits: but i am sure some users play chess on chess.com
 Ayushman965: yeah
 MSmits: i have in the past
 jacek: chess programming wiki?
 Ayushman965: so you've quit chess.com?
 MSmits: i just did it casually
 MSmits: i didnt consciously quit
 Ayushman965: so you quit it when you were dreaming?
 MSmits: no i just stopped without actively making the decision&#160;:)
 Ayushman965: why do you speak like that?
 Ayushman965: like you were coding something?
 Ayushman965: "actively making the decision"
 aangairbender: politeness
 Ayushman965: ahh
 Rafarafa: so how do I make my python class subscriptable? I'm googling a bit the __getitem__ constructor but I can't seem to figure out what to do, any pointers?
 aangairbender: I also play chess.com sometimes just to spend some time
 Ayushman965: you into cubing? @aangairbender
 Illedan: Hmm, we didn't really need mirror match yet :thinking:
 aangairbender: what is cubing? Ayushman965
 Ayushman965: solving rubik's cubes blazing fast
 aangairbender: Rafarafa python:worried:
 Ayushman965: because you have a pfp of a rubik's cube

 aangairbender: it is imo
 j4at: Creating a simulation for this will be a pain in the ass. It's also weird that they don't use small applications at all but mention it the statement just to confuse us&#160;:)
 aangairbender: rather to teach us in wood leageues
 aangairbender: with small apps games finished in 10-20 phases
 j4at: ow
 emh: I hope infinite training bug will be fixed. I lost a bunch of battles to it
 BugKiller_328: hi, Can you suggest me bot programming puzzle which is easist for training minimax?
 BugKiller_328: purpose of minimax programming traning
 MSmits: well ultimate tic tac toe has an easy simulation, but it's difficult to come up witha  good evaluation function
 MSmits: so if you dont mind using a bad eval function and just want to practice minimax
 MSmits: it's fine

 Illedan: We? Teamwork? :O
 Illedan: ^^
 wlesavo: the rules with shaddy cards are so obsure, i still cant figure out the whole rules. it seems like releasing an app with shaddy = good is not possible, is that true?
 Illedan: Can you rephrase wlesavo?
 jacek: you cant release 5th application with shaddy
 wlesavo: jacek oooooh
 aCat: Zylo is showing me his errors ;p
 jacek: BugKiller_328 you can try connect 4
 Illedan: Tell him he is stacking too much Technical debt
 aCat: he just found out that 5th release cannot use shooddy :P
 therealbeef: When you 'play' a card, where does it go? the rules don't tell this
 Illedan: Discard pile
 therealbeef: thanks
 therealbeef: the UI doesn't show all steps, can be confusing to figure out what's going on
 aCat: board state is unknown?
 aCat: and you cannot actualy reason about it - because of opponent actions hidden?
 jacek: in FoW games you can see everything in viewer
 therealbeef: which part is unknown (besides oppo's hand)?
 aCat: lik e he used daily routine to remove some skill from some table
 Illedan: You can just count the cards in all hands to figure what he did
 aCat: still seems stupid to not simple give BOARD state
 therealbeef: you want even more lines of input?&#160;;)
 aCat: useful
 aCat: yes
 aCat: If i deal with 454 lines I can deal with 454+1
 kovi: board state you mean how many cards on desks?
 Illedan: Could just add a BOARD line in the card list
 aCat: y
 Illedan: Which is the count of all remaining cards
 kovi: isnt it 5-allother?
 Illedan: yes
 aCat: but they can go back and forth with  TASK_PRIORITIZATION and there are 36 bonus skills
 kovi: true. we cant know bonuses
 Illedan: You can?
 Illedan: 36-allother
 kovi: sorry, didnt care about bonus/td till now, they are also tracked
 Illedan: What do you think about:
 Illedan: Check if the last N actions are coding or train and stop the next one.
 Illedan: Just to prevent the loops
 Illedan: You can force it with smarter plays, but then you really try
 jacek:     private void initGameFromState(String state) {
 jacek: oh my
 Illedan: :D 
 MSmits: Illedan i am looking for your bug. This trainride is 30 min. If my wifi holds, i might find it
 GroutchKeu: o/
 therealbeef: Do desks 0 and 7 count as adjacent?
 Illedan: yes
 therealbeef: but there's the admin desk in between&#160;:-/
 MSmits: it's very thin, negligible in width. This is why the admin guy is so cranky and stealing your cards
 aCat: :D
 therealbeef: When a play let's you draw cards but you have none, you just draw nothing?
 wlesavo: so turned out the best way to get bronze is to ask for rules in chat. still a mystery for me why this rule is not in release section
 eulerscheZahl: that's when the infinite loop kicks in therealbeef
 eulerscheZahl: first replay in forum discussion
 Illedan: They are working on a fix
 Illedan: Hmm, need to track the amount of actions I have left, once the bugs are fixed
 MSmits: Illedan your train bug is being worked on too?
 Illedan: No
 Illedan: not as I know

 Sheeesh---: if i use task_prio... skill does it mean i lose two cards and add one card? 
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: well not exactly
 MSmits: task prio goes in discard, but you trade another card with a card on the board
 Sheeesh---: oh i see
 Sheeesh---: thanks!
 MSmits: if you're not using the task prio that turn for an app, there is not much reason not to use it to swap another card
 MSmits: its still your card, part of your deck
 therealbeef: Continuous Integration sounds like it would be a permanent skill
 Astrobytes: I thought I understood this game when I went to bed last night, now that Iook at it again it feels like I've never seen it before&#160;:)
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: same 
 MSmits: Illedan sorry couldnt find it, learned a lot about the referee though. I hope to run into the bug myself once i start using these cards
 Illedan: Can't find it either
 Mortis_666: hello, i have a question, what does technical debt cards  do besides tie breaking?
 aangairbender: dont let you draw good gards:joy:
 aangairbender: *cards
 Illedan: Mortis_666, it is a dummy card you can draw instead of something usefull
 Mortis_666: oh but u will get it from using shoddy skills, so it wont actually matters if u use shoddy skills?
 Kururugi: it's a surprise tool that will help us later
 Mortis_666: 🤔
 Ayushman965: anybody use pygame?
 Ayushman965: here?
 Astrobytes: there is a contest currently ongoing, it's doubtful you will get a meaningful reply for such a non-codingame-related question
 MSmits: Mortis_666 it does matter. If in future turns you get your hands full of dummy cards you will regret it
 Mortis_666: ok thx
 TINOUAINANI: there is a bug in CODING and TRAINING&#160;?

 Astrobytes: rubber duck debugging ftw
 b0ot: My updated approach: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jsfiddle.net/yz1h47ut/">https://jsfiddle.net/yz1h47ut/</a>
 Astrobytes: kinda busy with the contest tbh
 Astrobytes: Possibly get a better response on the discord I think
 eulerscheZahl: he answered himself already
 eulerscheZahl: i was about to suggest the same: add val to memo instead of x,y
 Astrobytes: I know, read the following statements
 eulerscheZahl: he asked the same on discord?
 eulerscheZahl: i still have to start coding for the contest. motivation, where are you?&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: No, I was suggesting he might get better feedback on the discord
 eulerscheZahl: but he doesn't need it anymore. that's what i said
 BrunoFelthes: why sometime the card that i draw go to the pile, not to my hand?
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/26becfc7-0b19-43c7-a7d7-aca457cb1633">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/26becfc7-0b19-43c7-a7d7-aca457cb1633</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oops
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: clicked the link, then missed that line
 eulerscheZahl: my first thought was a bool[] reachable for lookup
 eulerscheZahl: more efficient than the dict with hashing
 Astrobytes: As for motivation, this is the last time we will have a contest with the chat
 Astrobytes: So you must motivate yourself, for old times sake
 eulerscheZahl: or i take a nap first
 Astrobytes: Whichever works for you&#160;;)
 emh: Astrobytes so sad. will discord be online tho?
 Astrobytes: emh yeah it is. Sure, the discord will still be there
 emh: ok
 Illedan: BrunoFelthes  got an example?
 Astrobytes: oops, missed your question BrunoFelthes, apologies!
 eulerscheZahl: referee with bugs and they are patching java starter code
 Astrobytes: easier to fix quickly I guess
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, they did something about the infinite loop too
 VizGhar: grumpy euler
 BrunoFelthes: i already understood, i is because i passed at the administration poste, and discarted my card, so i buy one card without action... and pass my actions and the card go to  the pile
 eulerscheZahl: no, not grumpy
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: hey struct
 Ayushman965: hey struct!
 Harsh_Chourasiya: Hey
 Sheeesh---: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641837166">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641837166</a>
 Sheeesh---: turn 9
 Sheeesh---: how did i go back without passing the poste&#160;?
 struct: you did pass I guess viewer just didnt show it properly 
 struct: you lost 2 bonus cards
 Sheeesh---: oh i see
 Sheeesh---: my bad then
 struct: but on turn 16-17
 struct: opponent passes and it does the same?
 struct: its strange
 struct: It seems like a bug to me
 struct: Opponent goes from table 7 to 0 and doesnt throw cards
 Sheeesh---: yup i saw that too
 Sheeesh---: she lost 1 bonus card
 struct: Yeah but shouldnt it be throw card phase?
 struct: Anyone that understands the rules better can confirm if this is a bug or not?
 Sheeesh---: actually the bonus card vanished
 struct: oh 1 card is gonne from discard pile?
 j4at: I'm writing a Green Circle simulation in Python. I'm pretty tired  :( anyone else writing a simulation&#160;?
 struct: yes i am
 j4at: C++&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: why python j4at?
 j4at: NN&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: oh for offline purposes
 j4at: yep
 Astrobytes: was gonna say&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: good luck!
 jacek: just copy paste referee. ezpz.
 j4at: ty&#160;:)
 struct: so if I only have 1 skill type in hand it automatically discards those when I go throw admin? 
 struct: through*
 putibuzu: yes, it should
 Snef: Anyone have a abug with permanent card not showing&#160;?
 putibuzu: but I think there is a bug when it comes to bonus cards, as in the example above (turn 16-17 as you mentioned) only 1 bonus card is discarded
 Snef: putibuzu discard is one by one
 asdf1234562456: wow I just discovered this website, this is so cool!
 asdf1234562456: think I'm gonna do one of these every day from now on, I can't believe I didn't find this earlier
 putibuzu: Snef hmm weird I thought it is supposed to discard 2 here
 Snef: putibuzu when you do a whole turn&#160;?
 putibuzu: Snef yeah, when you pass the admin desk :thinking:
 putibuzu: probably need to study the Referee a bit better
 Snef: You get to throw one card
 Snef: but twice
 Snef: so two turn for two throw
 putibuzu: aah I see, thank you&#160;!
 putibuzu: sorry if I confused someone! :sweat_smile:
 AryanTripathi: sup
 eulerscheZahl: i like this comment :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L116">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L116</a>
 Astrobytes: someone posted that earlier, absolute classic :D
 eulerscheZahl: was afk-ing. should get my travelling passport in 4-6 weeks
 Astrobytes: oh nice, when are the finals?
 eulerscheZahl: you instantly know what for :Dnov 15th-18th
 eulerscheZahl: The Encore, Boston
 eulerscheZahl: hotel/casino. looks expensive
 Astrobytes: lol :DNo expense spared eh! Nice :D
 eulerscheZahl: in the past TCO was in las vegas. they even put up extra security staff to oversee the nerds
 eulerscheZahl: worried of card counting or such
 Voleur2Poules: coucou les nullos
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: "oversee the nerds" :D
 Astrobytes: Is it streamed live? 
 eulerscheZahl: there will be a live-cast i think
 eulerscheZahl: rip my anonymity
 Astrobytes: Cool, will have to watch that for sure :D
 Astrobytes: Well, you could go in disguise. False moustache and hat!
 struct: gl euler and have fun
 eulerscheZahl: for now there is only this announcement: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/UVxvcbzXerM?t=883">https://youtu.be/UVxvcbzXerM?t=883</a>fast cuts and with zoom lag

 Astrobytes: Nikolay: the least excited person 
 struct: Yeah I remembered that aswell uljahn
 bobth: wat, I just was in two clashes at once and didn't know about one of them
 Astrobytes: hahaha yes :D
 jacek: so 200 is game phases, not players turns
 struct: isnt it the same?
 darkhorse64: count move phases for turns
 jacek: is it 200 inputs total?
 jacek: or more
 struct: 200 inputs
 Astrobytes: afk
 Westicles: Did you guys decide the contest is fun?
 emh: yes hehe
 emh: after initially thinking it was not
 Illedan: I want to buy the boardgame and play it :P
 jacek: oO
 struct: A bit of a pain to sim but I think its fun
 jacek: viewer could be more descriptive
 struct: yeah
 struct: Do they accept pull requests?
 struct: push
 struct: or w/e its called
 Illedan: yes
 struct: Maybe I can add a debug toggle?
 Illedan: And break all previous replays? :D 
 Dapps: debug toggle would be nice
 struct: It doesnt break
 Illedan: oh
 Illedan: Do it anyway
 Illedan: show the applications below the admin desk as 2 squares with the color of requirement :D
 struct: impossible to fit all the applications
 struct: I havent decided if I will do it or not yet, havent even looked at referee
 j4at: Why the statement doesn't mention the sizes of the card piles at all :thinking:&#160;?
 struct: what card piles?
 j4at: bonus / debt
 emh: Each of those desks contains 5 skill cards at the beginning of the game.
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/f561d3bdcbd3ed9154caa26c8f644df641af363d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L90">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/f561d3bdcbd3ed9154caa26c8f644df641af363d/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L90</a>
 struct:  36 BONUS skill and 100 Technical Debt cards available on the board.
 j4at: Yep, its not in the statement
 struct: I guess its only available on bronze
 j4at: ow
 Illedan: Hmm, what to do with the dance when both player swap on jumping above each other :thinking:
 struct: wdym?
 Illedan: When both players avoid to stop next to the other
 struct: no idea
 emh: ohh just realized MOVE can take two parameters
 emh: thought it was automatic to get from other desk if it was empty
 FrankR: what does it mean for Training and Coding to be able to "play X more card(s) from their hand"? Can you immediately play Training and then another card like Refactoring?
 struct: yes I think it means you can play N more cards  on that turn
 struct: So you could do that yeah
 struct: since training allows you to play 1 more card
 eulerscheZahl: i checked the referee and can confirm
 FrankR: and if you draw another training or coding, you can just keep it going and draw through your deck further?
 eulerscheZahl: there is a bug active currently where you can keep training until the game ends
 FrankR: I thought all cards you play just go to discard and you reuse them next round?
 struct: The bug happens if you use training and have no cards to draw
 FrankR: oh.. or did you mean training until turn 200?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, you can currently block your opponent from ever playing
 Dapps: any word when it will be fixed?
 eulerscheZahl: check the forum. they have a fix but not deployed yet
 struct: We are out of task prio cards sorry
 MSmits: hey, when moving, in what order does move (gain card)/give/throw happen?
 FrankR: how does it work? does the played training go immediately into discard, is reshuffled into draw and then drawn?or is discard reshuffled into draw, it draws and the played training is then discarded?
 Illedan: move, throw, give, gain
 Illedan: I think
 MSmits: so you gain the card last?
 struct: So I must give before gaining?
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 JohnyDaison: Speaking of Task priority, can someone explain this?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/U8ufuyJN">https://pastebin.com/U8ufuyJN</a>
 MSmits: time to look at referee again..
 Illedan: A bug JohnyDaison, it is fixed. not deployed

 Illedan: Throw first
 Illedan: Then give
 JohnyDaison: ok, so we're not supposed to play Task prio at all for now, or is there a workaround?
 Illedan: Don't do it without CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION on your hand :D
 Illedan: And don't do it on CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION without 2 of CI in your hand :P
 JohnyDaison: you mean _with_?
 Illedan: No
 Illedan: Copy paste bug
 JohnyDaison: so if I had 2 CI, it would work?
 struct: so when I move next to opponent the tech cards go to the discard pile?
 Illedan: mhm
 MSmits: Illedan i saw that but still trying to find where it says you gain the card after throw/give
 struct: MSmits from what I undestand from the viewer thats what happens
 struct: you throw, give and then gain
 MSmits: from viewer sure... i'd like to know from the referee though, just to be sure

 MSmits: looks like it happens at the same time...
 Illedan: Oh, the player tooltip contains more info, nice
 struct: it just looks
 MSmits: ahh but the order does not contain GIVE 5, so i guess you gain last

 AryanTripathi: btw we get 300 or 250 XP for our contribution getting approved?
 AryanTripathi: demn so many people online in the chat
 Ayza: 250 XP
 Tanvir: I'm in the first league(wood 2), what are the usage of the cards which are in DRAW location? As application can only be released using the cards which are in HAND 
 AryanTripathi: kk
 JohnyDaison: your new HAND is drawn from DRAW
 AryanTripathi: how to solve happy numbers I m confused
 Tanvir: JonyDaison when it happens?
 Mortis_666: At the beginning of your turn, your team draws 4 cards at random from their draw pile.
 Tanvir: Are the cards in HAND replaced with the DRAW or juses added to the HAND
 Tanvir: just*
 struct: Can I use task prioritization to remove itself?
 struct: Like TASK_PRIORITIZATION 3 5
 MSmits: nooo don't break the game struct
 MSmits: I am guessing you can't. If you can, that is a bug
 struct: at least it doesnt show in moves 
 MSmits: makes sense
 struct: if you have 2 task prio you can though
 MSmits: also makes sense
 struct: yes
 struct: same for Continuous integration I guess
 MSmits: indeed

 GNye22: Has anyone done Death First Search Part 2?
 GNye22: Or have an understanding of some basic BFS?
 GNye22: I'm going through this algorithm in the posted article, but the cost calculation isn't making sense 
 FrankR: I still don't understand this Task Prioritization.. If I have 3 cards of that type and my opponent 2.. why is it still possible to get one more via task prioritization?
 MSmits: maybe you get a bonus card?
 MSmits: damnit, i cant find a good opponent to test against. Either they are too strong or they keep doing the training bug
 GNye22: Could someone take a quick peek at this for me and see if I'm just missing something here?
 GNye22: I just am not understanding this line here: if connected_gw[i] &gt; 0 and parent &gt;= 0
 GNye22: I don't understand why the cost would remain the same rather than be cost[cur_node] + 1
 GNye22: article linked here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/dfs-agent-skynet/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=skynet-2">https://www.codingame.com/blog/dfs-agent-skynet/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=skynet-2</a> Looking at the Thinking as the Player section
 VizGhar: Hey guys, any news?
 maxlabinch: war in ukraine (it's a good news
 maxlabinch: )
 aangairbender: :confused:
 maxlabinch: :innocent:
 JohnyDaison: GNye22 that specific line handles the case when you reach the last node before the gateway, so the path is finished, no need to +1, the else below does +1 in every other case
 MSmits: If the team goes through the administrative task desk (between the desks 7 and 0), they lose 2 skills cards from their hand (they can choose which ones).  
 MSmits: Discard or back to board?
 aangairbender: back to board
 MSmits: ah that's painful
 aangairbender: that's helpful I think, no other way to get rid of trash cards (except give or prioritize)
 elderlybeginner: amount of input data is overwhelming
 GNye22: JohnyDaison but I'm confused, if you take a look at the graph used in that article, it's trying to calculate shortest turn cost from the source node, but using that algorithm, that specific line would initialize the cost of Node 2 to 1, but the cost of Node 2 should be 2, or am I doing something wrong?
 MSmits: aangairbender do you get so many trash cards then? You get to choose which desks you go to right?
 JohnyDaison: GNye22 the "cost" is not the distance the robot has to travel, but distance to nearest gateway
 GNye22: ok, so then how is the cost of Node 1 come out to 1? 
 JohnyDaison: you are running the code?
 GNye22: Because starting with the node vertex, whose cost is 0, node 1 is reachable from the source and is not visited and then because it is not connected to a gateway its cost becomes cost[source] + 1, so its cost would be 1
 GNye22: And no, I'm tracing it on paper cuz its just pseudocode, I'm just not following
 GNye22: Running through that algorithm basically just marked every non-gateway as a cost of 1 and all gateways as a cost of 2 for that specific graph so I'm majorly confused
 BrunoFelthes: can I see the applications at the visual interface?
 JohnyDaison: GNye22 hm, looking at it again, I'm confused too. Seems like maybe something was omitted in the pseudo code or there is logical error 
 GNye22: Ok, at least I'm not crazy haha, I was starting to think I was lmao
 BrunoFelthes: Can someone help me? I have 2 bonus cards + 1 skill card. And an applications that costs 4 from on skill, and 4 from the skill from my card, should I be able to release the application?
 therealbeef: BrunoFelthes nope, and nope
 BrunoFelthes: why? what i'm missing?
 eulerscheZahl: if the skill card is one of the required, why not?
 eulerscheZahl: no and yes to my understanding
 struct: I would say yes?
 therealbeef: sorry, nope and yes indeed
 struct: since you have 4 good points and 4 bad
 GNye22: Which program are we discussing here ^
 struct: Green circle
 therealbeef: Irony Circle
 MSmits: what is confusing about this game is you don't know what phases just happened
 struct: wdym MSmits?
 MSmits: even with throwing cards. If you have to throw 2 cards, it's 2 different phases
 MSmits: so if you already threw 1 card, there is no way to know from the input you did so
 kovi: im just implementing phase que
 struct: check previous phase MSmits
 MSmits: is that given in input?
 struct: no
 struct: you are right  yes
 MSmits: that's what i meant, it's weird
 struct: but its easy to work around it
 MSmits: yeah it can be worked around, but it's painful when connecting your sim to the real game
 BrunoFelthes: it is at the input MSmits
 MSmits: the gamephase is
 struct: yes bruno but you can distinguish between 1st thor and 2nd
 MSmits: but not the previous gamephase
 struct: cant*
 MSmits: same with training 
 struct: Since they are both THROW_PHASE
 MSmits: i mean coding, the thingy that lets you play 2 cards
 aangairbender: you can check amount of cards in your hand maybe
 MSmits: you just need to record your previous phase i suppose
 MSmits: but that doesnt work when you chain coding cards
 aangairbender: yeah that's the easiest way
 MSmits: you basically need to record the number of plays left, like in the referee
 aangairbender: also if action is performed automatically this doesnt work
 struct: yes MSmits
 BrunoFelthes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641931584">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641931584</a> at the turn 80, i have a application with the following requirement: [0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0], why it did not opened the release fase?
 JohnyDaison: The fifth App is not allowed to have shoddy skills used for it
 BrunoFelthes: hummmmm
 BrunoFelthes: ok
 MSmits: pfft shoddy coders
 therealbeef: Seems they didn't exactly follow the way of working that is advertised in this game
 MSmits: what are you referring to therealbeef?
 MSmits: (I don't disagree btw)
 SonByrne: is this one shorter or longer than the last challenge?
 MSmits: same
 therealbeef: the game could have benefitted from some more code review, architecture study, daily routines, etc
 MSmits: :grin:

 jacek: nope. im quite newbie here
 eulerscheZahl: you are too young to our community
 eulerscheZahl: there was a hero selection in the game. with WAIT for default hero
 eulerscheZahl: you could spawn a HULK and then WAIT for another hulk
 jacek: is hulk op?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and ceg was complaining in chat about a guy with 2 hulks at the top of gold. didn't believe him until he shared a replay
 eulerscheZahl: hilarious
 eulerscheZahl: and you could also move the tower that represents your base with skill effects
 Illedan: -.-
 jacek: do you have some script for joining multiple java files into one?

 jacek: thx
 MSmits: I joined almost immediately after though
 MSmits: or maybe it was after meanmax
 struct: lets not forget that SC 2021 had a massive bug too on day 1
 struct: and I tested for it ...

 struct: if the scores were the same
 IAmTheBestPlayer: hello I am the best player
 MSmits: confidence
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gotta go to a bday party, but I'm thinking MCTS is best for Green circle... anyone else trying this?
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII take into account the fact that there are probabilistic elements. a move does not always lead to the same gamestate
 MSmits: so you can't directly connect actions to nodes
 MSmits: unless the nodes don't represent gamestates
 MSmits: for example, when playing a training card
 MSmits: you draw 2 cards, but you dont know which
 MSmits: you might think: States not connected to nodes? No opponent interaction? Let's use smitsimax. But the probability thing is like an opponent interacting with your bot, it is an outside influence
 Ayushman965: where are you guys coding this?
 jacek: at home
 MSmits: in a nuclea bunker
 MSmits: +r
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, I just finished my structures and gamestate stuff.  There's so much stuff, I'm not sure what to trim as far as making cloning faster.  But if I were able to run 1k sims for each possible move, that sounds like a probability curve could be generated
 kovi: i agree msmits, but maybe we can simplify random draw and assign to action groups
 BrunoFelthes: i will just add a million if else
 MSmits: sure yeah, it just needs some kind of dirty solution
 struct: never again
 MSmits: or a if else tree, which is in line with the company policy. Save energy
 BrunoFelthes: much better than run ten minutes finding a solution
 Illedan: Ah, we need to code green?
 BrunoFelthes: lets save energy
 MSmits: yeah Illedan
 Illedan: Should only allow 1 submit during the contest
 Scarfield: less computation time should give more points
 BrunoFelthes: hauhauhuhuahua
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gamestate eval seems kinda simple... number of releases adjusted by remaining required somehow
 BrunoFelthes: 1ms each turn
 MSmits: ye let's penalize all those python users&#160;:)

 MSmits: :balloon:
 MSmits: (there is no blimp emote&#160;:( )
 jacek: can we recreate game state from the inputs?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: some things are missing
 MSmits: opponent hand is secret
 MSmits: also you need to keep track of the phase
 jacek: :rage:
 MSmits: if the previous phase was throw and the current phase is throw you need to throw 1 more card, if the previous phase was not throw and the current one is, you need to throw 2 cards
 struct: Ill just ignore opponent
 MSmits: well you do need to know his current position
 MSmits: and what cards he has in total
 MSmits: otherwise you cant sim yourself
 struct: I mean Ill act like he cant move
 MSmits: there's a better way
 MSmits: act like he's not on the board for subsequent rounds
 MSmits: otherwise you will bias your search toward dealing with that permanent location he is on
 struct: I see
 struct: Il ltry
 Dream1234: Hello
 struct: I only have coded move gen yet
 MSmits: I am working on sim, but it is messy
 MSmits: trying without playing cards first
 Dream1234: do people swear or its community freindly
 MSmits: dont even know what including training and coding will do
 MSmits: those are not mutually exclusive Dream1234
 MSmits: I can be friendly, yet swear
 MSmits: or be unfriendly and not swear
 Dream1234: okay thx
 jacek: bloody hell, why
 Dream1234: language
 linjoehan: with chrono how do I add a duration to a timepoint?  time_point endtime = starttime + timelimit;
 Dream1234: language bro
 Ayushman965: where in website are you coding this?
 Scarfield: c++
 Dream1234: hello

 struct: nice the tooltips help
 Dream1234: @antiwonto are you admin?
 MSmits: you mean to avoid having to calculate a duration many times?
 MSmits: that's smart
 Dream1234: lol
 MSmits: never considered that
 struct: just check the timer every N iterations

 MSmits: antiwonto is spamming too :P:
 kovi: lovely tooltips, thx [SG]Sebastien
 [SG]Sebastien: you're welcome
 struct: only thing missing now imo is empty frames
 linjoehan: MSmits I don't calculate it everytime just at the start of my turn I do a ton of if now &gt; endtime
 MSmits: yes, that was my point
 MSmits: it is smart
 MSmits: you avoid calculating durations
 MSmits: I recognize your genius
 linjoehan: Ah yes "That's the reason I did it)
 linjoehan: Now I need to figure how to do it
 linjoehan: Ok chrono documentation where are you
 AbrahamJLR: Rip, 504 Gateway Time-out error while i'm playing.&#160;:'D
 emh: me too
 MSmits: same
 TINOUAINANI: Helllllllppp :joy:
 aangairbender: I guess it for everybody
 MSmits: at least we can still chat. That is the important part
 linjoehan: me too
 MSmits: yes you are also an important part
 MSmits: without you there would be no checkers
 linjoehan: No not that I was me tooing on the 504
 jacek: checkers? that tutorial game?
 TINOUAINANI: its back
 linjoehan: Its a tutorial game now?
 MSmits: no jacek = sarcasm
 jacek: in other words: jacek = no sarcasm
 MSmits: that's meta-sarcasm
 Scarfield: no jacek =&#160;?
 linjoehan: sarcasm is not allowed in chat, also I never get sarcasm goes over my head everytime
 BrunoFelthes: no technical debit is the new meta?
 Illedan: There is a meta?
 BrunoFelthes: yeah, you are the first you, you are the meta
 BrunoFelthes: i will copy you
 Illedan: I played a lot of card building board games :P
 MSmits: linjoehan this is a good thing. It makes you feel jacek is complimenting you all the time
 linjoehan: yeah his #1 in checkers using a NN. that's amazing
 MSmits: yep
 TINOUAINANI: the application needs are the given by number of cards or number of skills neded&#160;?
 jacek: how do you know its NN?
 MSmits: we know its jacek
 struct: its jacekmax
 linjoehan: man I don't know how to read documentation
 Westicles: Something is missing... why aren't people as when silver opens over and over like usual?
 Westicles: *asking
 MSmits: they are too busy reading the statement for the 23rd time
 MSmits: or maybe the previous contest wasnt that long ago and many players here are not 1st timers
 jacek: by now youd get 2k in bronze
 MSmits: game is hard
 MSmits: btw, another thing that is missing from input
 struct: I should have released backgammon before the contest
 struct: so people could practice for this
 MSmits: once you're throwing away cards at admin desk, you dont know where your bot is going&#160;:)
 MSmits: you really need to keep track of a lot of decisions your bot made

 struct: I think this is a bug
 struct: I release 5th app and game still goes on
 MSmits: opponent gets same number of turns
 struct: ah
 MSmits: i am guessing you are player 1
 struct: "The hackathon stops as soon as one team releases its 5th application."
 struct: So I guess the statement is wrong?
 MSmits: well just poorly worded. It's corrected further down
 Scarfield: "When a team has released 5 applications, the game will end once all teams have played the same amount of turns."
 struct: ah but then its corrected
 struct: I see
 struct: A bit confusing sorry
 MSmits: this game has a lot of those
 MSmits: I remember with ooc the only confusing part was that I thought you could teleport using surface
 therealbeef: very agile: working software over documentation
 Scarfield: yea the statement is lacking unfortunately, but statements are hard to write when you know how the game works, and dont know what people will question
 pedrosorio: "very agile: working software" hmm
 MSmits: yeah, i am not criticizing the achievement of making this game, just stating the obvious. I wouldn't be able to pull this off anyway
 MSmits: making games is hard as struct said
 AdemDj12: is there an event running rn
 MSmits: yes
 AdemDj12: where i can find it

 Myrky: Hey
 Westicles: what a great name
 Westicles: University of Kasdi Merbah Ouargla
 MSmits: Sounds like you're casting a spell Westicles
 Myrky: Can someone give me a tip on the Body weight is a girl's secretproblem?
 Myrky: What`s the math trick?
 jacek:  / 0
 Westicles: you can solve it on a piece of paper with simple formulas
 Myrky: I tried a system of ecuations
 Myrky: But you don`t know the order of the pairs
 Westicles: the biggest number is sum of two heaviest, same with smallest, etc.  you can logic it out
 AdemDj12: omg whats this
 Myrky: ok got 
 Myrky: Thank you
 Myrky: That`s what I was missing
 MSmits: AdemDj12 are you blown away by the statement of the event?
 AdemDj12: yup too much to read specially when my english is on the weak side
 Westicles: there's are french version if that helps...
 AdemDj12: so the application need some ingrediants to be released am i right
 Myrky: Thank you guys, I did it. You rock
 AdemDj12: Westicles why would you assume my french is better than my eng
 Westicles: because french is the language of love? :P
 MSmits: :heart:
 AdemDj12: lol i would love if we could translate statments &lt;3
 MSmits: there's chrome addons
 MSmits: maybe if you translate it back and forth between several languages it would resolve some of the confusion
 AdemDj12: yup but memebers can do better job 
 pedrosorio: MSmits xD
 struct: This contest is hard
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: yes
 pedrosorio: so maaaany rules
 struct: im already exhausted and its been 1 day
 struct: maybe its the heat
 AdemDj12: i am confused a bit
 pedrosorio: you can feel the competition, buggy code 12h ago ~40th place, drops to 80th over time, fix all the bugs, 40th place again
 pedrosorio: AdemDj12 aren't we all
 MSmits: he only just read it, which is why he is only confused a bit
 pedrosorio: lol
 MSmits: it will get worse before it gets better AdemDj12
 AdemDj12: every application need one bunch of this things to  (

 AdemDj12: right&#160;?!
 MSmits: sure thats part of it
 AdemDj12: what the card part i am missing
 MSmits: you are missing a lot
 AdemDj12: whats*
 MSmits: i cant explain it in a few sentences
 AdemDj12: yup i think
 MSmits: try wood first
 MSmits: dont worry about cards
 AdemDj12: i am in wood 
 MSmits: i mean playing cards
 MSmits: just do the releases
 UndyingDictator_c722: I need a hint on problem Object Insertion
 MSmits: move and release
 linjoehan: Ah ok solved the timer thin no more timeouts
 MSmits: nice
 linjoehan: I set the duration as a double and it didnt like I found the alias thingys and used that
 struct: oh we get 2 matches now
 struct: nice
 linjoehan: std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::time_point endtime = starttime + std::chrono::milliseconds(timelimit);
 MSmits: I am saving that snippet
 linjoehan: I knew you would, right now I got to figure how to not get stuck in draws
 jacek: in checkers? impossibru
 struct: it is really impossible
 struct: I shared end game database here before
 linjoehan: lol Im actuall playing checkers again. Some dude sent me a msg to tell me that he is finally ahead of me now I got to gofix the damn thing
 jacek: w00t
 linjoehan: It is possible for me <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/641982256">https://www.codingame.com/replay/641982256</a>
 linjoehan: I don't save the game history I bet you can tell
 jacek: i do. maybe thats why i can escape some draws
 Westicles: UndyingDictator_c722, I just used 4 nested loops
 linjoehan: Do you have a punish for reaching the same position when you are ahead? jacek
 linjoehan: Oh no you would not you use a NN
 struct: Here are the endgame db
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.edgilbert.org/EnglishCheckers/KingsRowEnglish.htm">http://www.edgilbert.org/EnglishCheckers/KingsRowEnglish.htm</a>
 struct: if you want
 jacek: i have transposition table and if i encounter the same position, i just use 0.5 * NN's eval + 0.5 * draw
 struct: 102gb
 linjoehan: Now how do I get that into my CG code 
 struct: I think recurse tried to use this
 linjoehan: Ah jacek some mathemagic nice
 struct: not sure if he succeeded or not 
 struct: Can you paste the NN's eval jacek?
 struct: ty
 jacek: its simple: repeated position are meh. if NN thinks its good position, it will avoid it. if its bad, it will be encouraged to draw
 jacek: only second layer. you can easily reconstruct the rest
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7efcd85-e777-400d-8dd4-362f3050dcea">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7efcd85-e777-400d-8dd4-362f3050dcea</a>
 linjoehan: It is simple but simple is often rather pretty and genius
 struct: ty, I will now reverse engineer this and make counter book against you
 linjoehan: It's only simpole once you've seen the answer
 Scarfield: is jacek a simpole?
 linjoehan: Does that say that your father played a cello in the band
 linjoehan: I think without the timeouts I will pass him again then I don't have to fix the draw thing
 linjoehan: I haven't touched this thing in over 2 years it's funny what a little ego can make you do
 MSmits: it's even funnier what a large ego can make you do
 linjoehan: how big is the database for all of checkers. I know it exists.
 MSmits: no it does not
 MSmits: there exists an endgame DB of 10 pieces
 MSmits: and there exists a partially stored game tree that proves a draw
 MSmits: on perfect play
 jacek: next step since oware?
 MSmits: otherwise you'd need to store around 10^21 states
 linjoehan: The dudes that crunched the game to determine that the starting position is a draw, they must have it
 MSmits: no
 jacek: they weakly solved it
 linjoehan: ah it's a perfect play db 
 MSmits: the genius of their result is that they did not need all of the states
 MSmits: it's weakly solved, not strongly solved
 MSmits: oware is strongly solved
 MSmits: I am trying to weakly solve it
 jacek: an interesting read <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php">http://www.fierz.ch/cake186.php</a>
 struct: Even I am able to strongly solve games like TTT
 MSmits: kudos&#160;:)
 jacek: even the guy got convinced into n-tuples
 Scarfield: i only managed to solve TT
 MSmits: no Toe?
 Scarfield: nope, to difficult
 MSmits: or no Tic?
 Scarfield: actually just TicTic

 MSmits: kind of yeah, but it's a lot of work
 Illedan: I didn't do anything serious yet though

 NNWWSS: im new and i have programed a lego robot with no training
 MSmits: do you mean the robot has no training or you don't&#160;?
 NNWWSS: no i have no training
 BrunoFelthes: changing from js to java :P
 MSmits: and the robot does?
 NNWWSS: it got past a big obstical
 MSmits: did it destroy the obstacle?
 NNWWSS: it passed it
 NNWWSS: and the lego robot can also pick up a lego brick and move it to another spot
 MSmits: any spot?
 NNWWSS: also the robot have a color sensor and a button that if pressed does an action and it also has a camera and a ultra sonic sensor
 NNWWSS: yes any spot
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: sounds cool
 NNWWSS: and it also can make any sound that you want it to
 NNWWSS: and im only just passed 5th grade
 MSmits: ahh I see
 NNWWSS: i was told from testing that if i was in a class of 100 kids i would be the smartest one
 MSmits: ah, I think most of us here would
 linjoehan: how tells you that?
 MSmits: except jacek
 linjoehan: *who tells you that?
 NNWWSS: i was also getting extra work caus i got my work done way before everyone else
 NNWWSS: my teacher
 NNWWSS: and my mom
 NNWWSS: and my other teacher
 MSmits: ahh ok, this site is only right for you if you can do some python coding or some other written language
 MSmits: if you've only used coding blocks in lego mindstorms, that might not be enough
 NNWWSS: my teacher thinks that i should become a programmer
 MSmits: probably you should yes
 NNWWSS: so im gonna learn more and program more
 linjoehan: do you like math?
 NNWWSS: like math?
 MSmits: sure, but as i said, if you have no programming experience at all, this site will be too hard.  you need to know how to use loops, if/elses, input and output
 NNWWSS: I love math
 NNWWSS: ok
 MSmits: if you dont know those yet, you'll learn them in less than a week on a different site
 MSmits: not sure which is best
 NNWWSS: ok
 NNWWSS: scratch maybe?
 MSmits: just saying, you can learn a lot here, but it's not for complet ebeginners
 MSmits: no, scratch is also visual, with coding blocks
 NNWWSS: ye
 MSmits: you need real code
 linjoehan: Oh no not scratch
 NNWWSS: ok
 MSmits: you can experiment with python turtle maybe
 MSmits: to start with
 MSmits: and then do stuff with the console
 NNWWSS: also for the lego robot i programmed it all by myself
 NNWWSS: no help at all
 VizGhar: go for python, easiest if you don't need to know what is going on HW level
 MSmits: yeah, i am sure you got the computational thinking/logic down, but you need to learn about written code too, that takes some time
 linjoehan: I hate python so much
 NNWWSS: yes i bet it does
 MSmits: dont listen to linjoehan
 MSmits: python is great
 MSmits: but other languages are great too, they just take more time to setup sometimes
 NNWWSS: everyone has their own opinions never judge someone elses opinion just because you dont like it
 linjoehan: yeah I guess I hate it because I didn't learn it first
 VizGhar: go perl :D
 MSmits: NNWWSS go here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/">https://trinket.io/</a>
 MSmits: import turtle
 linjoehan: haha perl
 NNWWSS: ok
 MSmits: then turtle.forward(100)
 MSmits: look up the documentation
 MSmits: and make drawings
 MSmits: good place to start
 MSmits: but you need a real course after that
 MSmits: python starter course
 MSmits: on some website
 MSmits: brb
 NNWWSS: ok
 linjoehan: Is there a decent gamified coding thing for new coders?
 linjoehan: Asking for a friend
 NNWWSS: well ima go bye
 BoBot: of course when I changed the code to not moving next to opponent, I did not check that I would not move to the same room where I was....ez bronze now
 VizGhar: linjoehan I didn't find such resource (for free). Would like to see one... So I'm working on my own. But I have close to 0 time for that, so it will probably fade away
 JohnyDaison: VizGhar do you know about Scratch&#160;?
 VizGhar: I know about scratch... but block coding is not enough to teach high schoolers
 MSmits: I agree
 MSmits: It's not enough for this 5th grader either I think, not for long
 MSmits: block coding is only good to introduce computational thinking, so as not to get distracted by syntax
 VizGhar: I think breaking point is somewhere between 5-7 grade (switch to normal typing)
 MSmits: it depends a lot on the student
 Rafarafa: is the default ai in green circle entirely deterministic or it has random moves mixed in?

 BrunoFelthes: MOVE 2 3
 VizGhar: ah... ok
 VizGhar: cardTypeToTake... Havent reached that point yet :P
 MSmits: there's also that card with 2 indices
 BrunoFelthes: i never use it
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f4e7d554-2169-47f4-b1a7-dcdf8341653f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f4e7d554-2169-47f4-b1a7-dcdf8341653f</a>
 MSmits: TASK_PRIORITIZATION
 struct: task prio is 9*8
 struct: so 72
 BrunoFelthes: i use only 2 task prio
 jacek: sorted
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f7176bfc-4014-4fa7-97f6-70058ca689a0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f7176bfc-4014-4fa7-97f6-70058ca689a0</a>
 MSmits: oh yeah, i forgot that daily routine thing
 MSmits: that is annoying
 struct: is not too bad
 jacek: in game or real life
 BrunoFelthes: why 28 release?
 Illedan: All possible actions?
 struct: mod 8
 MSmits: no i mean it explodes by brute force&#160;:)
 MSmits: my
 struct: ah
 jacek: there are 28 possible applications to randomly choose from
 struct: well but you dont have 28 at the start do you?
 struct: ah but they are all the same
 struct: so id 0 is always equal for each game?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: they have fixed id
 MSmits: you can tell from the fact that their numbers go up to 27
 jacek: say, hypothetically if someone would train policy net, one would choose all possible moves as output layer. like in chess they use over 5000 nodes
 jacek: so in this game, 198 is the output. most of them of course illegal
 struct: I see
 MSmits: and we are not criminals here
 struct: Have you read the game name?
 wlesavo: does DAILY_ROUTINE gives reach to both sides from the table, or only forward? 
 struct: both sides
 wlesavo: thx
 jacek: actually it can be. since there are only 12 applications, we could artifically give them 0-11 ids
 MSmits: for training purposes you want the ids to be fixed
 MSmits: all apps can show up in a game
 BrunoFelthes: for all games, the apps is always the same?
 MSmits: the possible apps to choose 12 from are always numbered the same
 MSmits: so number 26 in one game is the same app as number 26 in another game
 MSmits: but number 26 is not always part of the game
 BrunoFelthes: ok, 12 apps from 26
 MSmits: from 28
 BrunoFelthes: ok
 MSmits: 8*7 / 2
 MSmits: because there are 8 different skills
 MSmits: and you dont pick 2 of the same type
 MSmits: and the reversed order is the same app, so divided by 21
 MSmits: 2
 MSmits: I sort of have an endgame solver for the last app, but it almost never gets to the last app
 VizGhar: I cant imagine how can somebody squish trained net to 100k chars...
 MSmits: so not particularly helpful. But it helped me get the sim up and running and debug it
 jacek: VizGhar yeah its unimaginable
 MSmits: if my bot has a smiley face it solved (ignoring play cards still)
 struct: MSmits this is not oware
 MSmits: you can still solve it on your turn&#160;:)
 MSmits: you control everything in your turn, all phases in a row
 MSmits: the winning moves can be very bad moves in general. Just counting on the same if-forest for the whole game is not a good idea.
 MSmits: like.. you may have to throw good cards away just to get a specific card from a desk, or even a bonus card
 MSmits: so I brute forced my final turn
 struct: I see
 MSmits: but i havent included play_card uet
 MSmits: yet
 struct: Im still far away from having anything working
 struct: But at least my move gen doesnt seem to have any more bugs
 MSmits: task prio could get you a winning move also
 MSmits: or maybe training or coding
 MSmits: possibly training, probably not coding
 struct: yeah
 kovi: i still dont get it how they do without testing/debugging
 struct: Need to search for searches that take into account&#160;%
 MSmits: when you use that, you dont get a winning move, you get the move with the highest win probability
 TINOUAINANI: is there is a bug whene we RELEASE application , i always validit it with less 1 skill or 2&#160;?
 struct: wdym kovi?
 MSmits: i think kovi is referring to the fact that testing and debugging is not a desk in the game?
 kovi: yes&#160;:)
 struct: ah lol
 MSmits: I am not a professional coder and i got that one :P
 struct: Im not a professional either
 Rafarafa: so you don't have access to opponent deck
 MSmits: of course you are, you work for CG
 MSmits: hammering trolls
 Rafarafa: you have to keep track of it or sth?
 struct: Im a professional chat moderator 
 wlesavo: btw is there any updates regarding infinite loops bug?
 MSmits: i guess so&#160;:)
 MSmits: isnt it fixed yet?
 wlesavo: idk
 kovi: afaik fixed
 struct: what was the fix?
 struct: What happens now if you use training and dont have cards to draw?
 kovi: there is a played_cards pile
 kovi: which is separate from discard pile
 wlesavo: oh thx
 MSmits: so you cant play a card twice in the same turn?
 kovi: that is what i understand
 MSmits: yet another thing to put into the sim
 wlesavo: PLAYED_CARDS the cards you played during this turn and that will go to your discard pile at the end of your turn
 kovi: i still dont use play
 struct: Just make the used cards go into disacard pile MSmits
 struct: or isnt it the same thing?
 MSmits: yeah, but i could have infinite training in my sim if i am not careful&#160;:)
 struct: how if the card goes into the discard pile?
 MSmits: discard gets resuffled into draw pile
 MSmits: even during a turn
 struct: o.o
 OldJohn: OK so silver (wo opening book!)
 MSmits:&#160;?
 jacek: hm?
 struct: Where is the part that makes discard pile go into the draw pile 
 struct: I cant find it in the statement
 OldJohn: So time to stop for tohight... 
 MSmits: i found it earlier today, sec
 kovi: And their personal discard pile will be reshuffled into the draw pile when it gets empty.
 jacek: you dont find many stuff in that statement
 jacek: line racing?
 OldJohn: No Green Circle
 jacek: no silver in green circle oO
 OldJohn: Ces cartes seront sa pioche personnelle et sa défausse sera recyclée pour refaire une pioche quand cette dernière sera épuisé
 MSmits: ohh i thought you meant in the source struct
 OldJohn: So yes Bronze&#160;:-)
 MSmits: i saw it there earlier
 struct: ah ok
 struct: so how could the training loop happen?
 OldJohn: 3 paragraph of the rules in french
 struct: if the draw pile was empty shouldnt it get the cards from discard?
 OldJohn: third
 MSmits: yeah but the training card will go in there
 MSmits: i will draw it again&#160;:(
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Player.java#L301">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Player.java#L301</a>
 struct: So the exact moment the draw pile gets to 0 cards
 Dream1234: lol hello
 struct: then it should get all the cards from discard?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: ok thanks
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: going to take a break
 struct: same
 TINOUAINANI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642039595">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642039595</a>
 TINOUAINANI: at 48 i shold get one dept card
 TINOUAINANI: becouse the applecation need 4 from tow deferent skills
 TINOUAINANI: i have 4 from one skill and 2 from the ather one plus one bonus card i still need one skill but i didnt get dept card whay&#160;?
 Illedan: MSmits, infinity draw is fixed
 Illedan: Any cards used go into the PLAYED_CARDS list and you get them back when you are done with your round
 cegprakash: holaa!!
 cegprakash: promotion to wood1! streaming live!
 cegprakash: next step Bronze!
 wlesavo: wood to legend submit day 1
 struct: close to imposible
 MSmits: Illedan you dont get this in your input though right?
 Illedan: You do
 Illedan: Updated a few hours ago
 MSmits: but there is no such card location is there?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3fb2fb8-4f76-4687-82db-2b232b930817">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3fb2fb8-4f76-4687-82db-2b232b930817</a>
 MSmits: wouldnt this make us crash?
 Illedan: You can read the tooltip on your discard pile
 wlesavo: HAND, DRAW, DISCARD , PLAYED_CARDS
 MSmits: whats the difference between the discard pile and the played pile then?
 Illedan: You can't draw your played cards
 Illedan: So you can only play a card once during a sequence of PLAY_CARD
 MSmits: yeah ok, but how do you know whats in your discard pile
 Illedan: To prevent infinite loops
 MSmits: if you no longer get it as input
 Illedan: YOu get it
 Illedan: mine was just empty in that input
 Illedan: You don't get empty card lists
 Illedan: sadly
 MSmits: ok, but does this break bots then?
 struct: impossible to break my bot with this
 Illedan: most people aren't advanced enough yet
 MSmits: have to take a look at this tomorrow
 kovi: technically it can, but ...
 MSmits: it will probably miscount the cards in desks
 kovi: yeah
 struct: oh right, thanks MSmits
 MSmits: it's a good fix though
 struct: oh I dont even need to update my code for it
 MSmits: just not a pretty one to have to add during the contest. Good thing it has been only 1 day
 struct: PLAYED_CARDS dont show in HAND do they?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: but if you want to know whether a desk will give you bonus or a normal skill card, you need to know where all the cards are
 struct: yeah
 struct: that I keep track of
 PiterYeh: do you guys actually understand what is going on when watching replays?
 MSmits: barely
 struct: no
 PiterYeh: cool
 kovi: with tooltips now it is a bit better
 PiterYeh: oh they added the tooltip for apps? nice
 kovi: apps, desks
 struct: and player I think
 kovi: afaik player worked before
 PiterYeh: they did
 Edulol-1: I wen humbled
 Edulol-1: went*
 kovi: hmm...admin desk is adjacent to trainindesk?
 kovi: is this new?
 kovi: nvm...user error
 jacek: its alright, this is their 1st contest. on 5th contest they cant do shoddy
 kovi: hmm, training and coding doesnt seem to workno draw or more play, the game continues with opponent move phase comes
 Illedan: Only if you have nothing else to play, but there might be an Action bug
 Illedan: I just haven't found it after the update
 Illedan: And I couldn't find it while reading the source code
 kovi: yes, both cases those were the only skillcard in hand
 kovi: (solo skillcard)
 Illedan: And if there is nothing usable to play or no RELEASE to be done with the cards picked. Then it would end your turn
 kovi: i c.but there were no draws performed
 Illedan: I guess it just ends it, if you can't do anything anyway?
 kovi: well...technically draw should be done to deplete the draw pile
 Illedan: oh
 Illedan: it is not done?
 emh: did they update with the fix for infinite train/code bug?
 Illedan: yes
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3fb2fb8-4f76-4687-82db-2b232b930817">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d3fb2fb8-4f76-4687-82db-2b232b930817</a>
 Illedan: You get the PLAYED_CARDS
 Illedan: Which you can't redraw until the next round
 emh: ahh ok
 struct: im not getting that input what
 jk_java: anyone into music?
 struct: ah I get it how it works now
 struct: PLAYED_CARDS will always have only 1 value set to 1 right?
 struct: since you cant play 2 cards in 1 turn
 Illedan: wrong
 Illedan: You can have 5 TRAINING
 Illedan: and play them in sequence
 Illedan: PLAYED_CARDS are reset when you move to RELEASE/MOVE phase
 struct: ah thanks Illedan
 8swaglord24: just checking -- we're not given the current count of skill cards per location, we need to keep track of those ourselves?
 kovi: minor issue: there is no sense for p2 last turn if the opponent is already winning by 2
 kovi: (having 5:3 or better i mean)
 struct: thats a good suggestion
 struct: yes 8swaglord24 you need to keep track of it
 kovi: lets make it green: save a turn, save the planet
 8swaglord24: thank you
 darkhorse64: I do not think you can because you can move to a desk and pick a skill from another place
 Donotalo: the training skill - it says the team draws 2 cards and play 1 more card from their hand
 Donotalo: what does playing a card mean?
 [lazy]Opera: what is AUTOMATED and OPPONENT_AUTOMATED card locations?
 Westicles: 3 puzzles with 2 approvals, which will be next?
 jacek: frontgammon
 AbrahamJLR: Can I start a conversation with someone online by visiting their profile?
 jacek: only if they follow you
 AbrahamJLR: Rip. Thanks for answering me.
 Westicles: through the forum is the best way
 Westicles: finally crawled into bronze with first available move
 jacek: but RANDOM/WAIT are last ~
 PiterYeh: after turn 44, why does it not allow me to play another training? it just skips to the opponent's turn...
 PiterYeh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642083294">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642083294</a>
 Sarzorus: The Turn description doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Does move, use skill, release all happen in order? Do I need to check for which part of the turn I'm on? I keep getting invalid option when I try to release an application on purpose
 PiterYeh: Sarzorus when you read game state in the input you're told in which phase you're into
 PiterYeh: you can play only some actions depending on which phase you're in
 PiterYeh: you can only play release in release phase
 Sarzorus: Ah, thanks. I see the variable. It just isn't documented well in the rules
 PiterYeh: it takes a bit of trial and error to figure out what's valid when, but at least error messages are helpful
 FADED_C0RE: im not understand the clash of code stuff
 FADED_C0RE: im super new to c++
 FADED_C0RE: but i just cant figure it out at all
 PiterYeh: FADED_C0RE, try out some solo puzzles to get started on the platform
 FADED_C0RE: alr thanks
 PiterYeh: clas of code is just that but faster
 FADED_C0RE: ah ok
 struct: darkhorse64 you can keep track of it I think because you get all the cards that all players have
 darkhorse64: When you throw a card, it returns to its place&#160;? Yeah, I did not think of summing all cards. 
 struct: yes
 wlesavo: wait, permanent skills are consumed when used until you release?
 wlesavo: thats totally not obvious
 struct: Daily and continuous I think
 struct: Architecture*
 wlesavo: thats explains at least some of my bugs
 Illedan: That worked :tada:
 struct: nice
 struct: still if else?
 Illedan: Ofc
 Illedan: Doing sim on the side
 Illedan: But I'm not sure of the direction I want yet
 Illedan: Hmm
 Illedan: And some unlucky in the end
 struct: Can I use refactoring even if I dont have any tech in my hand?
 Illedan: Think it transfers to a wait
 Illedan: but it makes no sense
 struct: yeah
 struct: it ends up being the same result
 struct: I guess
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Might save some CPU time, if you could have done application with shoddy, but wasted the card to do it 
 aCat: hah again the same issue Illedan 
 aCat: like hey should I make state on bits and go try some search or keep normal arrays and heuristics
 Illedan: Normal array with sim
 Illedan: Then optimize when needed
 aCat: won't be too slow?
 Illedan: Nah
 aCat: all this array creation&#160;;]
 Illedan: Huh?
 Illedan: Cache the array
 aCat: ok, ok I stated it badly
 Illedan: 
 aCat: not creation, but more 'writing to space'
 aCat: for now I have some visualization
 struct: Im also using arrays for now
 struct: I just want something working before optimizing
 struct: I think im learning
 Illedan: Nah, you started too early on Legend or Delete :P
 struct: Legend here might be very hard
 struct: low player count
 Illedan: mhm
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/FnxiPSg">https://imgur.com/a/FnxiPSg</a>
 wearelegend: yeah
 wearelegend: dont know what I ll do
 wearelegend: ı didnt understand what ı will write
 Illedan: I like that aCat
 jacek: now buy the board game
 wlesavo: is there any info about will the game be available as multi after or not?
 aCat: #if DEBUGstatic class DebugImage
 aCat: all my code has this&#160;;]
 Westicles: wlesavo, thib said yes on discord
 aCat: wlesavo it will be
 aCat: thib confirmed, yep
 wlesavo: oh nice
 wlesavo: thx
 wearelegend: can you guys advise to me for 0 to learn
 wearelegend: ı have nothing
 wearelegend: but ı want to start it
 wearelegend: ı have time
 Sraiti: just do it 
 Sraiti: start
 wearelegend: do what
 Sraiti: with JavaScript  
 wearelegend: first java?
 aCat: OK, thanks for support Ille I will think about 'not optimizing prematurely
 Sraiti: java will work too
 Sraiti: anything just start
 wearelegend: zero information
 Sraiti: everything else will come with time
 aCat: but usually I like to have final state as fast as possible, to not waste time on rewriting 
 Illedan: Abstraction is key
 wearelegend: ım starting thx.
 Sraiti: here there's more than enough resources here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">https://www.theodinproject.com/</a>
 Illedan: Abstract away what you suspect you might want to rewrite
 jacek: wearelegend this site is for someone who knows the basics
 aCat: but - here bits does not seem big advatage as you have to take them and plus/minus all the time
 aCat: no idea what I want to write
 aCat: :D
 aCat: except 100 of ifs
 Illedan: Only 44 ifs yet
 Illedan: can go bigger
 wearelegend: thx jacek .
 wearelegend: yes not for me
 wearelegend: dont have basic too
 jacek: oh my, the half-assed nn actually works
 wearelegend: theodin project ı ll check it
 Illedan: For this game jacek?
 jacek: yeah
 Sraiti: good luck
 wlesavo: wow
 Illedan: :D
 wearelegend: good night guys
 Illedan: what is half-assed?
 wearelegend: thx for my first 
 jacek: not optimized architecture, trainig for half an hour etc.
 Illedan: Got replay?

 jacek: i still dont know the game by heart so i dont know how smart or stupid it is
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: crazy
 wlesavo: is it the submited version?
 jacek: yes. im 12th
 struct: nice jacek
 wlesavo: yeah, really nice for such a short period
 Illedan: makes me scared
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: But all bots are crap now
 Sarzorus: How do you train the NN? mock everything or somehow send information back to yourself?
 jacek: for now, playing games against the random bot locally
 jacek: once it reached 99.5%, i submited to check if it actually works
 jacek: so excited i dont know if im gonna be able to sleep oO
 struct: lol
 struct: I told it was a NN contest jacek
 jacek: :imp:
 j4at: My dude decided to copy past the referee while im here writing my simulation&#160;:'(
 Illedan: MCTS jacek? Or just 1 action?
 j4at: Are you using brutal tester&#160;?
 j4at: jacek
 jacek: Illedan just action. i dont have simulator in the code
 Illedan: Cool&#160;:)
 jacek: j4at no. i copy pasted referee and modified slightly to my needs
 Illedan: brutal tester is too slow for local training
 j4at: well, teach me how to run it?
 Illedan: No idea, didn't try since LOCM
 j4at: jacek help :c
 jacek: i dont use brutal tester
 j4at: you already said that :3
 jacek: then how could i help you oO
 j4at: I don't to know how to run the referee
 j4at: I'm tired of writing a simulation
 jacek: i copied most sutff had to modify to run without viewer and most CG SDK stuff. and its still in java :c
 j4at: Well, I don't know how to do any of that. Don't know java either. I guess will continue writing my simulation
 struct: ok so if I go over 4 on Daily routines it will give repeated moves

 jacek: oO
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you have history
 Automaton2000: it is a good choice
 emh: I'm having fun with heuristics. no plan to write a sim

 Sraiti: can anyone help me with the thor game
 Sraiti: as far as i understand there's no variable for the current position of thor

 jk_java: and TY
 jacek: you have starting position. you have to update them yourself
 jk_java: as in ThorX
 Sraiti: so i need to create new variables for that 
 Sraiti: ah okay i will try that 
 jk_java: and as jacek says you have to keep track
 jk_java: good luck, it is a fun game
 Sraiti: thank you guys 
 jk_java: :rocket:
 struct: jacek when are you submiting again?
 struct: oh you jsut did
 struct: :p
 jacek: imma sleep. there are so many ways to improve it...
 struct: gn
 emh: gn
 struct: I'm probably gonna rewrite, I didn't understand all the rules before starting to write the sim
 struct: It was a bad idea
 jacek: you dont read statements eh
 struct: I tried
 Westicles: RTFM 5 times
 emh: good night
 struct: Here I was thinking the game was making my pc lag
 struct: but its the chat
 struct: I forgot
 john.reumont: &lt; 
 struct: There is no way to know the current turn is there?
 BrunoFelthes: sum your turns + cardsPlayed?
 struct: But I dont know how many turns opponent played
 struct: But I guess it wont matter much
 VladTheInstaller: Hi all, I just got promoted to a higher league.  any idea how to refresh the default code in the IDE?

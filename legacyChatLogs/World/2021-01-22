 YCS-Venom: how do we know that we are playing with a bot or not?
 Severed: arent they all bots? Isnt that what we are doing?
 Uljahn: if you're not a bot why do you get captcha?
 Perlorodka: @kavandoctor I guess I know why you are asking.. And I simply had to store the demonstration of your amazing skills for future generations. Creating program to convert roman numbers to decimal in 38 seconds, just wow! Too bad you didn't share it afterwards..

 GoogleJeff: lol, clearly they are galaxy-brain and type at 1000 wpm
 GoogleJeff: it's python so they probably just did "import roman_numeral_clash_of_code_solver"
 Velcoro: I'm amazed that some people are actually willing to spend time to exploit an educational site in order to achieve higher rank in some virtual ladder, learning nothing in the process
 darkhorse64: What are you referring too&#160;?
 Westicles: gotta be clashes
 Westicles: or golf
 Westicles: Is that why Allis quit?
 jacek: who
 Westicles: Ah, he's probably referring to a new guy with 58 clashes that is about to pass him.
 Westicles: Someone up to shenanigans no doubt

 Velcoro: I was referring to kavandoctor
 Terralis: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Perlorodka: Allis was quite happy with the state of CoC and he was very active, participating in most private clashes.. but then he suddenly disappeared
 Westicles: Ah.  Well, I mean he is playing against guys who have done every clash at least 20 times.  I guess fairplay is a little nebulous all around
 Velcoro:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Yeah, when it comes to a point where you copy/paste from your database, it's time to move to something else. Bot programming for instance&#160;?
 Velcoro: exactly
 Sk0v: How do u play arena?
 Sk0v: in coders strike back
 KiwiTae: Sk0v read the description and hints
 Sk0v: i won the game and want to play against other players
 KiwiTae: press submit
 Uljahn: click Test in Arena
 Sk0v: i done that many times ntohing happening
 KiwiTae: your not in the ladder u need to submit your code
 Uljahn: are there any battles in the Last battles tab on the left panel?
 Sk0v: no there isnt
 Westicles: maybe a bug, jrke reported same thing on discord
 Bitse: I think all battle arenas are currently down. Battles aren't updating for Tron Battle either.
 Uljahn: looks like servers've stalled
 jrke: yeah battles bug i have reported
 Sk0v: its scam i cant move further i need my xp
 Uljahn: understandable, have a great day
 [CG]Thibaud: thanks jrke we're looking into it
 VizGhar: i though it was only sopra steria challenge&#160;:)
 ivnbcr: hi all
 Westicles: VizGhar imposteur! pas français!
 aetrnm: Hey, guys! What is the shortest programming language available here and how do I actually win "Shortest" game mode?
 alpha.: you can win most of them using python i think.
 alpha.: and ruby is amazing
 VizGhar: Westicles :D
 NK2910: Hackerrank&#160;?
 jrke: oh new update on CG
 jrke: ACTIVITIES AND COMMUNITY nice
 Westicles: Still when you click on friends, it doesn't take you to your friends
 Satzmann666: Heyo, did anyone else have issues with the ANEO puzzle? Im pretty damn sure my code is correct but tests 7 and 8 fail
 darkhorse64: Don't take it personally but for sure, your code is wrong.
 jrke: yes there is one minute thing you have to fix to get that perfect in aneo
 Passifi: the one with the traffic lights I had the same issue in my case it was something about floating point precision a value was like 59.99999999 or something like that and should have been 60&#160;:)
 Passifi: it drove me mad debugging it btw
 jrke: yeah minute thing i said
 darkhorse64: I do not see any update. Is it available from the home page&#160;?
 jrke: "ctrl+shift+r" try it darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: :thumbsup:
 Satzmann666: thx guys using Decimal did the trick
 G-Rom: A/B test for the menu, 50% chance to have it
 Kitkat260: morning
 Kitkat260: any tips for braces
 Westicles: Avoid fistfights?
 Kitkat260: thx

 yohyoh: hey
 Kitkat260: hi
 Kitkat260: how is everyone today
 ichwarsnix: hello, other people
 Westicles: don't you mean hell is?
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 ErrorRazor: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: so, who got the new header already?
 BlaiseEbuth: I
 eulerscheZahl: i may have. the livestreams have a yellow circle now. rest is the same
 ErrorRazor: I do see a different icon for livestreams
 BlaiseEbuth: This is visible on both old and new.
 eulerscheZahl: what else changed?
 BlaiseEbuth: But on the new the categories change
 eulerscheZahl: aah, got it in an incognito tab
 eulerscheZahl: activites =&gt; practice, compete, learn
 eulerscheZahl: and community
 eulerscheZahl: and discord link in its own community subsection
 Astrobytes: Yeah, got it as well.
 eulerscheZahl: is it removed from the chat then?
 Astrobytes: No, seems to still be there
 eulerscheZahl: it's costing valuable screen space&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: I agree. Should probably mention it.
 eulerscheZahl: your job, you are A
 eulerscheZahl: i'm B
 Westicles: there are probably ads everywhere, we all just block them
 eulerscheZahl: i tried to block the livestream with my adblocker
 Joseph_Mother: JOE LIKE JOE MAMA
 RoboStac: oh,  apparently I blocked discord message with ad blocker, was about to say I couldn't see it anymore
 eulerscheZahl: my troll sensor tingles
 Joseph_Mother: senses*
 RoboStac: but it's still there on my other pc
 Astrobytes: Joseph_Mother: be nice or be kicked.
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i should block the discord too :P
 eulerscheZahl: perfect, it's gone
 BlaiseEbuth: The new header seems not to be displayed in the same way that the old one... It appears on my chat client...
 Wang-sirs: :grinning:
 Joseph_Mother: coc
 Joseph_Mother: why coc
 Joseph_Mother: also why are you telling me to be nice i just helped him correct his words
 Joseph_Mother: thats a very nice thing to do
 Joseph_Mother: i dont appreciate you profiling me 
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't appreciate you trolling
 Wang-sirs: may i ask ,Can The code of the Rings  solved with GA optimization algorithm？
 Uljahn: what if someone answers negatively but it's actually possible? :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: What if someone answers positively but it's actuallly impossible&#160;? :thinking:
 Uljahn: exactly. why not just try and see for yourself?
 Westicles: All I know is Msmits got to 54 in 3 hours playing it manually
 Uljahn: MSmits is kinda GA under the hood i guess
 BlaiseEbuth: I'd like to say it's possible but with a very good evaluation function, and a non-naive generation of individuals, perhaps helped by some heuristics, and probably with more CPU/Time that allowed on the site...
 Kitkat260: sup
 Wang-sirs: great thanks
 Kitkat260: thats good
 MSmits: I'm more SA under the hood Uljahn, but i did do it manually. I was going to do a beamsearch for it this weekend
 MSmits: hope i can finish something that works
 jacek: i have the new navigation. and i still can find something else than clashes&#160;:(
 lopidav: where is the forum at
 lopidav: what is happening 
 BlaiseEbuth: A forum master lopidav has lost... 
 lopidav: I can access it via history but where is it on the page? Did it move to another site?
 jacek: commmunity -&gt; forums
 lopidav: oh, that's way better than it was before. Thank you
 eulerscheZahl: oh, now i have the new header as well
 jacek: oO
 Kitkat260: hi
 Joseph_Mother: m
 struct: How much time should I allow per turn for Amazons?
 struct: 75ms?
 Joseph_Mother: 69 ms
 Joseph_Mother: i miss shortest code ones
 struct: euler if you block these 2 things the streamer thing will be blocked
 struct: www.codingame.com##.container-0-2-47www.codingame.com##.on.contentContainer-0-2-23
 struct: or do you only wanna block the circle that show the number?
 Westicles: With ABP is comes back
 Westicles: it
 struct: oh i use ublock origin
 BlaiseEbuth: With adguard you can directly select to block on the page
 struct: I think most blockers allow that
 BlaiseEbuth: I got this&#160;: codingame.com##.live-streams-button-container
 Westicles: The problem is the three digits change every time you refresh (or maybe when the streams change)
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah, this is on the old header.
 BlaiseEbuth: On the new header&#160;: codingame.com##.live-streams-button-react-container
 Joseph_Mother: LUA WHAT THE FUCK
 Joseph_Mother: 5.0 == 5
 Joseph_Mother: WHAT IS YOUR
 Joseph_Mother: GRRRR
 struct: that isnt a lua problem
 struct: and chill with the caps
 Joseph_Mother: Im mad bruh
 Joseph_Mother: thats some bs
 jacek: oh my
 struct: jacek what time do you think I should allow for amazons?
 struct: or it doesnt matter much
 eulerscheZahl: UTC
 struct: I get a better answer everytime
 jacek: that was my style&#160;:(
 jacek: how many moves amazon game lasts?
 struct: max should be 92
 QuratulAinAftab: how can I get fast at coding. I have the logic in mind but diffculty in coding it
 jacek: 100ms is standard
 struct: ok, so 2 games it is
 struct: I was thinking on making it lower and playing 4 games
 jacek: 4 games? what for
 struct: I dont know I just thought it could be good
 struct: Maybe im wrong
 Astrobytes: 2 is enough
 jacek: 2.5
 jrke: for what?
 jacek: i couldnt find nice amazon memes
 struct: amazons jrke
 BtB1: boy the website is running really slow for me
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, i cant clash anymore
 JeroenB: I have the same issue
 TyTheDefaultGuy: Ditto. It's real bad.
 JLukeSkywalker: and this is why change is bad
 maras: it's laggy as hell today
 JLukeSkywalker: dont fix something that isnt broke
 TyTheDefaultGuy: Change?
 djmil: LAGS!
 TyTheDefaultGuy: (I've been away a while)
 JLukeSkywalker: they changed the entire site format
 maras: I'm waiting like 5 minutes to run my code
 JLukeSkywalker: and now its dying
 OldJohn: Yes I suppose there is too much ghosts somewhere&#160;!
 TyTheDefaultGuy: It just picked up dramatically for me.
 djmil: yes.. test cases fails on timeout 
 TyTheDefaultGuy: Scratch that..... it's bad again.
 TyTheDefaultGuy: :sob:
 JLukeSkywalker: try clearing your cache and site cookies so that it loads the new webpage
 JLukeSkywalker: helped me a bit
 djmil: nope) this is internal site problem
 JLukeSkywalker: there is definitely an issue connecting to the server, but the web page issues on your end will just compound it
 djmil: i've tryed incognito mode, and it can not open main page&#160;:(
 TyTheDefaultGuy: That's disconcerting....
 djmil: as hell!
 struct: yeah, very slow
 JLukeSkywalker: last clash i was in, no-one loaded in. 8 ppl got 0%
 JLukeSkywalker: good job codingame
 struct: Even bigger sites have problems sometimes
 struct: dont need to be salty
 ErrorRazor: Ok, the point has come across. Someone's probably working on a fix
 ErrorRazor: I'm slow
 monkey: Friday deployments ... always fun :wink:
 Salted: Maybe it's just me, but the site seems to be down a ton lately. Are they having budget problems?
 djmil: it's not only you)
 struct: They deployed today, it might have bugs
 Oguru: Glad to see i'm not the only one, i was just refactoring my code because i thought it was too inefficient (it probably was anyway)
 djmil: Friday deploys.. mmmm... my favorite 
 NikkiBear: uggggggh LOL
 KouaArmand: :scream: Friday deploy
 Astrobytes: Oh, not again. lol
 eulerscheZahl: the Sopra thing got too competitive, the 95% were intimidated
 Astrobytes: :D
 darkhorse64: The battles have been down for most of the day. It does not help. Saelyos posted a bot 18 mn afer the start and is still #1
 Salted: Oh it's getting bad. 503 errors. I'll try again tomorrow. 
 eulerscheZahl: Saelyos is a strong player
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw the issues this morning darkhorse64. Thought they'd fixed it.
 darkhorse64: he is and he is fast
 darkhorse64: too
 LouieAniez: show saelyos?
 eulerscheZahl: and he might had a bot already, at least for the classic multiplayer
 LouieAniez: whos*
 eulerscheZahl: even this contest isn't entirely new
 Astrobytes: Almost the same as the Klee one
 Astrobytes: Or whatever it was called
 darkhorse64: I wasn't there
 eulerscheZahl: only almost?
 eulerscheZahl: I didn't try Klee
 Astrobytes: I joined but didn't submit because it was codebusters
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't Klee the contest where they leaked all the email addresses?
 Astrobytes: I don't remember if it was exactly the same this time around or slightly different.
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 eulerscheZahl: that's an achievement: host a contest and the only thing I remember is a massive doxxing
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Was a real classy move :D
 jacek: now lets do the csb league recalc
 Astrobytes: the email leak was Klee's fault as well btw
 Astrobytes: Not CG
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: what's that BCC? never used it
 Astrobytes: I'm sure I still have the Klee apology email somewhere
 eulerscheZahl: i never registered for that contest, so I don't have it
 eulerscheZahl: but someone impersonating CG invited me to a paid coding tutoring
 eulerscheZahl: and some others too
 Astrobytes:  I remember that yeah
 Astrobytes: I've not had anything like that
 eulerscheZahl: probably got my email from github. it's not the one I use on CG
 eulerscheZahl: are you on github?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/astrobytes">https://github.com/astrobytes</a>this one?
 Astrobytes: I've got two, that's mine yeah
 Astrobytes: wtf is that
 Astrobytes: Oh Thor
 eulerscheZahl: i see a thor
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 Astrobytes: I had some short url pointing at it
 Salted: Anyone use this before?
 Salted: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i used some offline checker
 eulerscheZahl: you download a large file and run a script on it
 eulerscheZahl: and with high probability it tells you if you got pwned
 Astrobytes: That sounds... interesting
 eulerscheZahl: apparently I wasbut couldn't find my passwords currently in use
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't willing to enter my email in some random textbox of a website
 Salted: Google passwords seems to keep track of leaked passwords and lets you know if you're using a known password
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know right. "Have I been pwned..." - well, you have now :P
 Salted: Yeah, I tried my old school one. It's been pwned a lot apparently. 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/soprasteria">https://www.twitch.tv/soprasteria</a>Neumann speaking in that weird language again

 jacek: good this chat has prevention to accidently paste your password
 jacek: like **********
 eulerscheZahl: and he disabled the chat, we can't ping him&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Wat. Shocking behaviour!
 Salted: So if I paste my password it gets starred?
 jacek: eeyup
 Salted: slk##2Slkd%324
 Salted: Nope
 Salted: Doesn't work
 Salted: lol
 jacek: you can see it but we dont
 Salted: Hahaha!
 Salted: Alt + F4 key reveals uses email addresses in tool tips
 struct: On amazons should I bother rotating the board when players switch?
 struct: Or should just black go first
 eulerscheZahl: rotate avatars
 jacek: just switch players' positions
 struct: But board is symmetric
 struct: no need for it&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: do whatever the chess game does
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: random openings?
 Astrobytes: shuddup you 
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i downloaded flashpoint197k flash games waiting for me
 eulerscheZahl: and good ones from your memories?
 jacek: flash :unamused:
 Salted: Is codingame hosted through aws?
 eulerscheZahl: AWS/Azure
 eulerscheZahl: CG made contradicting claims
 Salted: Neat! 
 eulerscheZahl: i know that the frontend and email are from AWS
 eulerscheZahl: for the games they wanted to switch to Azure
 Salted: I'm working on getting the aws developer associate certification. Any opinion on those certifications?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it's mostly HR who cares about those
 Salted: It's been nice doing it so far. There's a lot of little things I didn't know amazon could do. 
 Salted: I guess amazon does a lot though
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: I got a 1 week training 2 years ago
 eulerscheZahl: was overwhelming
 Salted: It is overwhelming! I'm thinking of switching to coding from engineering. 
 Salted: I've been an electrical engineer for ~10 years but it's harder and harder to find work that pays anything. 
 kovi: 1 week training? must be a strong nn after that
 eulerscheZahl: seems jacek is influencing multiple users
 Salted: Ha! @kovi
 Westicles: I thought SW jobs are all in India now.  EE should make much more
 Salted: When we posted jobs for entry level ee we would get 400+ resumes. 
 Westicles: I guess it depends a bunch on specialty and location
 struct: site slow again

 Salted: Really? My chat was posted to a pastebin?
 Astrobytes: Which is also - broken
 Salted: haha, oh man
 struct: if its long enough it goes to pastebin
 Astrobytes: Depending on line breals
 Astrobytes: *breaks and length
 Westicles: Everything is broken.  The stream sounds like gibberish
 jacek: isnt this french?
 Astrobytes: mdr
 Salted: Well I was trying to say that EE tools have stopped getting updates for about 8 years. No new companies seem be entering the market. I think no new tools means that industry is dying or stagnant. So it's time to bail on electrical engineer. 
 struct: stream sounds fine on my end
 Clement.G.: is there any problem with codingame site&#160;?
 Salted: Friday update
 Clement.G.: When this will be patch&#160;?&#160;:/
 Salted: Zero idea
 Salted: But its definitely rare to be down like this. 
 struct: reminds me of contests
 struct: The sprint contest of locam was fun
 Westicles: perfect time for everybody write a couple more contribs
 struct: I cant give legalActions on Amazons
 struct: Should I give the number of legal actions?
 jacek: why you cant give legalActions?
 struct: I mean i cant give them all
 struct: for first turn its 2176
 struct: Its way too much
 Westicles: just give the best one
 jacek: alright then give number of actions
 jacek: are you gonna give 'random' like chess?
 struct: I could
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/gLXZnZs3">https://pastebin.com/gLXZnZs3</a>
 Westicles: So it seems very likely Tryangle Catch gets a 3rd approval today.  
 jacek: now lets wait till MSmits will give each move&#160;% winrate
 Westicles: Better to WIP it until the french one is over?
 thebest2333232: why is it so slow today
 thebest2333232:&#160;??
 DesmondW: I've always seen it slow on Fridays but not other days. Is that anyone else's experience?

 AutomatonNN: possibility to continue as in a bad code
 General_Imaginaer: is there a way solve the games in  assembler&#160;? 
 thebest2333232: no lol
 MSmits: what a stupid waste of calculation time, what's the point of knowing which side has a tiny edge with completely random moves
 MSmits: at least do this mcts style, why full random
 MSmits: I hope they needed the heating
 Astrobytes: Yeah, kinda strange study.
 Salted: Probably need a paper
 MSmits: you can probably write a paper with less than 1 billion games :P
 struct: its only 40 hours
 struct: not that much
 MSmits: oh right, full random, no search
 MSmits: i guess i spent a lot more on my meta mcts :P
 MSmits: but at least there is a *point* to that
 reCurse: Eye of the beholder
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: The only absolute fact is it's still better than cryptomining
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: guess so
 MSmits: hey Astrobytes I presented my project for game design todat
 Mekole: Is the site completly overloaded tonight?
 Astrobytes: Oh cool, how'd it go MSmits?
 MSmits: started with the yavalath demo and then proceeded to explain my game design
 Astrobytes: Yeah Mekole, servers are burning
 MSmits: during the talk, i heard through the zoom call: "YES I WON"
 MSmits: so apparently they were still playing the demo
 Astrobytes: hahaha epic
 MSmits: so i asked what level
 MSmits: "Beginner"
 MSmits: thats basically a 1000 iteration minimax
 MSmits: not even depth 2&#160;:)
 Mekole: @astrobytes thank for confirming
 Astrobytes: no worries Mekole
 Astrobytes: MSmits :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Hey, they're new to the game though
 MSmits: yeah its fine, but its just funny he exclaimed so loudly when its the lowest levek
 MSmits: I thought he beat the hard one
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: And that was your professor?
 MSmits: no, another student
 MSmits: professor was being professional
 Astrobytes: Ah, you present to the other students too, gotcha.
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: went well overall, i'm glad thats done
 Astrobytes: Game design doc went well too then
 MSmits: yeah they were impressed i think
 MSmits: except the one guy i guess, he was too busy playing yavalath
 Astrobytes: Do you have to take questions on it or it's more informal?
 ErrorRazor: Looks like site's working again
 MSmits: it's informal but the professor asked questions
 struct: Just wait until he comes here and takes the 1st spot on yavalath
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 MSmits: he did ask about codingame
 MSmits: so who knows
 Astrobytes: Oh nice
 MSmits: my next course is functional programming
 MSmits: starts in 2-3 weeks i think
 Astrobytes: Lisp?
 MSmits: elm i think, but it may be different
 Astrobytes: A lisp is a lisp is a lisp ()
 MSmits: no idea what that means, i still have to learn that
 jacek: or haskell
 MSmits: not sure, i saw an old version of their course explanation that said elm
 MSmits: I havent tried to check on US news for 2 days
 MSmits: it's great
 Astrobytes:  The problems are not going away though.
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: but it's boring enough to ignore now
 MSmits: i dont live there after all
 General_Imaginaer: inline assembler works in c
 Astrobytes: Status quo. Everyone can go back to sleep.
 MSmits: thats why he's called sleepy joe 
 1400179: Did dbd r disclose what he was doing on othello? Just curious
 MSmits: yes
 jacek: MPC
 Astrobytes: Yeah, multi probcut
 jacek: and 300k weights&#160;:?
 MSmits: multi probcut ab pruned minimax
 1400179: So minimax with linear eval?
 MSmits: i guess so
 jacek: he also used n-tuples i think
 1400179: Ah
 Astrobytes: You sure jacek?
 Astrobytes: Was that a subsequent version?
 jacek: he was talking about 300k weights. what else could it be
 MSmits: the probcut thing uses weights
 jacek: but its 2 or 3 params no?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, probabilities. You use them to cut...
 kovi: but a full random stat can be irrelevant. say if black has a single  winning 1st step and all other slightly loosing
 MSmits: jacek not sure, i thought it was more
 MSmits: maybe multiple lookups get combined to get those 2 or 3 numbers
 1400179: He has by far the strongest bot, at least according to my attempts
 jacek: we may never know until someone hilights dbdr
 MSmits: I knew that reCurse
 struct: oldjohn said its the bot that looks more human like
 Astrobytes: not that many params but you end up with a lot of probabilities.
 jacek: so you beat me reCurse?&#160;:(
 1400179: Not by much but yeah
 MSmits: the reason dbdr is not higher is because he's almost fully deterministic
 Astrobytes: Theyr'e used to influence a and b cutoffs, I've forgotten most of the algo
 1400179: db dr is the only reason I haven't submitted yet
 1400179: My winrates are absolutely abysmal
 Astrobytes: It's an excellent bot
 Astrobytes: Logistello on steroids
 1400179: logistello?
 MSmits: sometimes he plays perfectly as far as i can tell, but usually dbdr's bot makes 1 mistake. No more than that
 MSmits: when he plays perfectly i draw him
 jacek: othello that won 6:0 to human champion in 97
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Buro's othello program. Was what he invented MPC for iirc
 1400179: Ah
 struct: Didnt oldjohn work with him?
 1400179: I'm starting to have a theory why NN eval is not working but it's kinda annoying
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 Astrobytes: @struct
 MSmits: I'm curious, do share if you want reCurse
 1400179: The endgames are extremely easy to compute
 1400179: But extremely hard to predict
 MSmits: checks out in my experience
 1400179: So I suspect all the NN energy is focused on endgames that can be computed in microseconds
 1400179: So I need to write an endgame solver
 Astrobytes: Yeah that sounds sensible
 MSmits: thats not hard to do, but will take you a bit of time
 1400179: That's where I notice the biggest deltas of eval anyway
 MSmits: it would actually make a lot of your NN's better if you added stuff like that
 jacek: i noticed you dont use shortest wins in bt sometimes. meh
 1400179: I only bother with what's necessary
 MSmits: i noticed you sometimes make a mistake on oware with 7 or so seeds remaining
 MSmits: have seen a draw turn into a win fo rme
 1400179: It's possible, I suspect oware has the same issue with endgames
 1400179: As othello
 Astrobytes: Something like that :D
 MSmits: yeah makes sense
 Astrobytes: Game is bonkers
 Astrobytes: (oware)
 MSmits: well let me know if you want any help with the endgame stuff, i dont mind sharing some of how i did this with oware. it's a pretty algorithm
 1400179: Well I'm doing othello first I guess
 MSmits: would you go for a typical ab solver?
 MSmits: or a specialized solver
 MSmits: specialized would go deeper, but if you dont solve, you dont have a good move
 1400179: Not sure what you mean by specialized
 MSmits: like proof number search
 MSmits: it only proves the win/loss
 MSmits: but it doesnt give an eval score
 1400179: That's what a solver is
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: but a normal minimax search also solves
 MSmits: and if you fail, you still have a good move
 1400179: Sure but I'm not talking about search, I already have it
 MSmits: i meant with a simple eval instead
 1400179: Then I have two problems
 Astrobytes: Did you do a proof number solver in the end MSmits?
 MSmits: no, but i understand the theory. I was gonna use it for uttt, but never did
 1400179: Not sure what you mean by that
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a bit more work
 MSmits: by proof number search?
 1400179: Yeah
 MSmits: it's a treesearch that prefers the most solving nodes
 MSmits: and only solves, but doesnt eval
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Proof-Number_Search">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Proof-Number_Search</a>
 1400179: Ah i googled proof number solver, serves me right
 Astrobytes: I had some papers but I think I've misplaced the links
 MSmits: it is usually better than a typical ab or mcts solver search
 MSmits: but you won't have a backup move if all you calc time goes into this
 1400179: That's the point
 Angecide: but you would have to do normal mcts until the tree contains terminal nodes right?
 MSmits: Angecide no, 
 MSmits: it's hard to explain over chat, it's a bit weird
 MSmits: basically, nodes are just unsolved, until they are solved, no eval or other stats. It just keeps the number of unsolved children
 MSmits: or descendants actually
 MSmits: let me find a good paper sec
 1400179: Intuitively it seems like it shouldn't be better than minimax
 Angecide: but they will stay unsolved for a while I imagine, until you reach the later stages of the game, but for uttt you would have to pick a move fast
 Angecide: so you would end up picking a unsolved move, which is just as good as any of the other unsolved move, and thus just a random move I presume
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/pnchapter.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/pnchapter.pdf</a>
 MSmits: this one is ok i think
 MSmits: comparison with ab on page 21
 1400179: huh
 MSmits: i remember another paper that also compared with mcst solver, but i cant find it now
 MSmits: in any case, all PNS variants were usually better than ab or mcts
 MSmits: makes sense to me, solving is all they can do, it's specialized for that one purpose. 
 Astrobytes: yeah there's a couple of papers (probably still by Winans et al) that helped me understand
 1400179: Well today is one of those days I'll feel dumber by the end of it
 Astrobytes: *Winands
 Astrobytes: I feel like that every time I read one of these papers
 MSmits: reCurse it's informed ignorance
 MSmits: before today you did not know
 Astrobytes: hah, nice
 1400179: It has to use some kind of heuristic
 MSmits: yeah, it counts solved and unsolved descendants
 1400179: Does it assume stuff like positions that lost are more likely to lose again or something?
 MSmits: with backpropagation
 1400179: Ok so then it's heavily dependent on the domain
 MSmits: probably, but it has been used in many
 MSmits: it might be very effective in othello because othello has the mobility as part of most evals
 MSmits: and mobility means more nodes
 MSmits: or this might make it anti-effective. Not sure
 1400179: I'd rather not tackle more heuristics
 MSmits: it's not really  a heuristic
 MSmits: it's just the only thing that is tracked
 MSmits: like mcst tracks wins and visits
 MSmits: this tracks solved and unsolved instead
 MSmits: so it's quite simple
 1400179: I think the tree will cause a massive overhead
 1400179: I'm not looking to solve depth 20 positions
 MSmits: ohh, my bot does 15-20 
 MSmits: just from mcts solver
 1400179: I want to solve positions that take less time than an eval
 MSmits: well that's no problem then if you only need the last 10 or so
 MSmits: just use any typical othello eval
 1400179: Noooooooo
 MSmits: 10 is real easy
 1400179: I want to minimize domain knowledge
 MSmits: well it's really minimal, my bot has 7 params and features
 MSmits: but ok
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: you can just do mobility only
 MSmits: maybe that'll work
 MSmits: just avx the thing, there's some stuff you can steal online
 MSmits: very efficient move generators
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/84bd28a3-5815-4e28-b0e9-2138c9aab92a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/84bd28a3-5815-4e28-b0e9-2138c9aab92a</a>
 1400179: If I start handcrafting evals then what's the point of going NN
 Astrobytes: dammit
 MSmits: reCurse the point is, there is not much handcrafting required since you require so little depth
 1400179: So why mobility
 Astrobytes: In contrast to other best-first algorithms PN search does not need a domain-dependent heuristic evaluation function to determine the most-promising node to be expanded next [2]. In PN search this node is usually called the most-proving node. PN search selects the most-proving node using two criteria: (1) the shape of the search tree (the branching factor of every internal node) and (2) the values of the leaves.
 MSmits: cuz you already have the moves generated. Count them :P
 1400179: Sorry I don't get it, use it for what? Move ordering?
 MSmits: yeah i guess so
 MSmits: or iterative ab?
 MSmits: to use with TT
 1400179: I think a dumb ab is as much as I can afford
 MSmits: why "afford" 
 MSmits: code size limits?
 Astrobytes: This can be done offline
 1400179: No
 1400179: The point is to let the eval focus on better roi
 MSmits: dont you just use the full calc time in those last 10 turns?
 1400179: Instead of focusing on stuff that can be solved in microseconds
 1400179: But if the ab takes 1ms then it's pointless
 MSmits: roi?
 1400179: return on investment
 MSmits: ohh now i get it
 1400179: There is a domain agnostic property, if it takes less time to brute force than eval then just brute force it
 MSmits: you want to end the search early
 MSmits: and solve
 MSmits: i thought you would spend a whole turn doing this
 1400179: No
 1400179: Well maybe
 MSmits: oh that's tricky
 MSmits: then you cant do 10 turns
 MSmits: too expensive
 MSmits: if you want to do it at every leaf 10 turns from the end i mean
 1400179: I don't know how fast it can be
 MSmits: I wonder if TT is helpful here
 1400179: No
 MSmits: probably not no... there's some, but not enough
 Astrobytes: PN* uses TT
 MSmits: it's very helpful in oware, with those low seed boards
 1400179: Probably
 MSmits: Astrobytes optionally i think?
 Astrobytes: No it's part of its iterative deepening structure
 Astrobytes: *multiple iterative deepening
 MSmits: reCurse the reason i recognize your end game issue is that when i am hardcoding moves vs old john for example, my bot tends to do the best moves for 10-20 turns in a row sometimes and then messes up right before it can solve, it's quite annoying
 Astrobytes: A few other variants use it too
 MSmits: so it doesnt need the book until the very end it seems :P
 1400179: Well it's also that the game is at its most volatile at the end
 MSmits: so there's something volatile about the endgame
 1400179: Even though it's very straightforward
 MSmits: yeah
 1400179: Like imagine if a game is solved at the end by very complex formulas that a computer can bruteforce super easily
 1400179: Then why bother learning that formula
 MSmits: the best bots i think have 3 separate evals, beginning, mid and endgame
 Astrobytes: *evals or approaches
 MSmits: there's 1 serious othello bot on gith
 1400179: Seems sensible
 MSmits: loads of code
 MSmits: it has those 3 evals
 1400179: I'm not even sure why I'm spending time on this tbh
 1400179: but w/e
 Astrobytes: I think I've seen that one
 MSmits: because you started :P
 Astrobytes: Play some Othello
 1400179: I don't even like the game
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: tbh it's not my favorite either. I prefer BT over it
 1400179: True
 1400179: BT is very fun to watch
 MSmits: but hey i never played it for real
 MSmits: Astrobytes says its fun
 Astrobytes: BT is just hardcore pawn...
 MSmits: it's just very strategically visual or however you say that
 MSmits: no beginner knows whats going on with othello
 Astrobytes: It's easier to visualise than Othello for sure
 MSmits: same with oware, that seed stuff is very obscure
 Astrobytes: If you actually play it (or a variant) physically it's not so hard
 Astrobytes: re. Oware
 MSmits: yavalath, connect4, BT, these are all games any beginner will be able to "get" in a few minutes
 MSmits: not be good, but at least follow
 1400179: Maybe I should have done checkers instead
 1400179: smh
 Astrobytes: Oware (and variants) are played by kids around the world
 jacek: its a draw-fest
 Astrobytes: As well as professionals
 MSmits: reCurse go here for checkers: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.fierz.ch/checkers.htm">http://www.fierz.ch/checkers.htm</a>
 struct: Thats why they play from certain positions on tournaments
 MSmits: jacek checkers is mostly drawn because most bots dont know how to finish a game
 MSmits: you get infinite repetition
 MSmits: even though any reasonable end game db will give the strongest player a win. But it might take 50 rounds and ab bots dont see that far
 MSmits: I still have it on my list to put a 3 piece end game db into checkers. I hope that helps a bit
 Astrobytes: You can use different variations on ab (or indeed a completely different algo) at various stages in the game remember
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: It just gets a chore to fit all those params, unless you've built for yourself a framework to do this automaticlaly
 Astrobytes: And here was me thinking that was the fun part :see_no_evil:
 MSmits: well I used to do this with CG bench
 MSmits: and sometimes locally depending on the game
 MSmits: but I really just need to do it automatically. Get some TD going
 Astrobytes: You do have a point.
 MSmits: jacek did it and he sucks at math apparently
 Astrobytes: No, he hates mathematical notation.
 MSmits: o right that was it
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: but thats a hurdle
 jacek: i just need to code the math
 MSmits: was just saying i need a TD framework
 struct: Dont know what to do for UI on amazons
 MSmits: what are your choices?
 MSmits: and also, what do you mean by UI?
 MSmits: it's a bot game
 struct: The viewer
 MSmits: ah
 captaineSlip: the User Interface 
 MSmits: techically the interface is the input/output structure is why i asked
 Astrobytes: that would be the API :P
 MSmits: well should it be different from other games in some way?
 struct: I guess ill do something simple
 MSmits: yeah i guess api is the correct term
 MSmits: you can always beef it up while it's in WIP
 MSmits: right?
 Astrobytes: Nothing complex needed atm struct
 struct: yeah i can
 Astrobytes: Yeah, as MSmits said, if something is needed it'll be pointed out
 MSmits: I dont know how to even write a search for a game with a branching of 1k :P
 MSmits: I need to prune over 90% of that
 struct: There are a lot of papers
 struct: they say from first 2k moves, 20 are good
 MSmits: does it remain that way?
 MSmits: 1% being good?
 Astrobytes: No.
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: so you hardcode the first move
 MSmits: or random from a set of 20
 struct: end game is hard
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: There's a reason they use it for research&#160;;)
 jambokampy: is clash super laggy for everyone or just me
 MSmits: with a NN, you have just enough time to lookup each possible move :P
 MSmits: without even a tree
 Astrobytes: jambokampy: sorry, it's a known issue, devs are aware
 jambokampy: ah no worries just wanted to check
 MSmits: jambokampy it's laggiest mode
 MSmits: gonna go sleep. Hopefully tomorrow i can get some cotr working
 MSmits: see if i can beat manual solutions 
 Astrobytes: lol, masochist. gn MSmits.
 MSmits: gn!
 zhoubou: Hi Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: hey zhoubou, how's it going
 zhoubou: Doing alright. Switching  between many things, finally "found" some time for CG
 zhoubou: How about you?
 Astrobytes: Always time for CG... well, not really, but you know
 zhoubou: Haha yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not much to report from here tbh
 Astrobytes: When is your work exam?
 zhoubou: 6.2.
 zhoubou: 6th of February, that is
 Astrobytes: Plenty time then
 Astrobytes: I got it&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Yeah, wasn't sure lol
 zhoubou: Yeah, I think it's decent amount of time
 Astrobytes: Enough to work some CG into the schedule outside of other life things at least&#160;;)
 zhoubou: Of course&#160;:)
 zhoubou: I'm wondering... How do you handle learning programming? Or anything for that matter. With so many things to go into, how to not get caught up in a rabbit hole with so much information available, so many different courses and tutorials. So many programs and learning paths. Omg lol
 zhoubou: Not to mention books and other resources.
 Astrobytes: Well, when I decided to properly learn I went from the ground up. 
 Astrobytes: Theory first.
 zhoubou: I thought trying to go from the ground up is my problem. I was thinking about re-learning math first.
 Astrobytes: The internet was a little less helpful than it is today. There's a lot of helpful stuff out there but also a lot of absolute crap.
 Astrobytes: Which parts of mathematics are you lacking in?
 Astrobytes: And what's your goal with programming?
 zhoubou: I have no clue re math. I have some basic knowledge in a lot of math, but very basic in most.
 zhoubou: I would have to start from algebra  or something
 zhoubou: Or past it
 struct: for some stuff you dont really need math
 zhoubou: Yeah, I've gotten quite a bit without much math
 Astrobytes: ^ It depends what you want to achieve and what level of knowledge you want
 struct: if you want to make a NN you probably will need math
 zhoubou: Re programming goal, I am thinking about it career-wise in the long run. In the short run, I want to build my portfolio, so some projects. In even shorter run, I'm here on CG, trying to improve.
 Astrobytes: For general CS stuff it's graph theory, discrete maths, linear algebra, maybe number theory, that kind of thing
 zhoubou: Not sure which path I would take
 therealbeef: don't forget that programming is a practical discipline; so just program a lot, and search for answers to specific questions when you encounter them
 Astrobytes: ^ yep
 struct: Everytime  I try to read the papers that are posted here
 struct: I cant understand the math
 Astrobytes: Many, many programmers are not overly well versed in aspects of CS, hopefully they know the domain they are working in&#160;:)
 therealbeef: You can also learn a lot from having your code reviewed by others
 Kitkat260: sp
 Astrobytes: Weren't you doing a CS degree struct?
 zhoubou: struct Does that represent a problem for you? Or do you manage?
 Astrobytes: Personally, I always recommend everyone doing mathematics to some level or another.
 struct: yes
 struct: But I still struggle with it
 Astrobytes: lost in a vector field&#160;:)
 struct: I have phases where my brain doesnt work at all
 struct: dont know why
 jacek: or struct field
 zhoubou: I am also interested in math, and would love to explore it, but I don't know to which extent, since I'm also interested in a ton of other stuff and I'm not sure how much time I can spend on math alone.
 Astrobytes: struct, I've been there
 Astrobytes: Still happens tbh
 zhoubou: I've got problems like that as well
 zhoubou: I think most people do to some extent
 Astrobytes: You have to 'chunk' things into what you *need* to learn in order to learn what you *want* to learn.And spend some time thinking about that beforehand.
 zhoubou: But how do I know what I need to learn until I learned it and see that I can use it in a part of a project?
 zhoubou: Maybe I'm overthinking this
 Astrobytes: Break "what you *want* to learn" into things you *need* to learn
 zhoubou: Hmm, that makes sense
 Astrobytes: Pick a goal. I'm not saying you need to think "I'm gonna make a self-driving car!" - start tiny!
 zhoubou: Well, CG is a collection of goals that can lead to my grander goals. So I'm onto a good start I guess
 Astrobytes: Small projects with clear goals, try to figure what you need to learn to accomplish that.
 Astrobytes: Yeah, CG puzzles and multis are good for that in a way
 ZtimE: tiny is key!
 Astrobytes: But a lot of stuff here you might never even use in a dev job
 ZtimE: also tiny is fun&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: True to an extent.
 zhoubou: Astrobytes I fear I might be wasting my time here then
 Astrobytes: No, not at all
 Astrobytes: Great place to practice languages and learn algorithms.
 zhoubou: Hmm
 Astrobytes: It's just likely you won't be using a/b minimax or MCTS in your day-job&#160;:)
 therealbeef: CG is also great to experiment
 therealbeef: and to learn optimization
 zhoubou: Ah, I see. Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the time constraints really make you push yourself
 zhoubou: I guess you're right guys
 Astrobytes: But definitely learn elsewhere too. CG is more 'practice-based'
 zhoubou: What am I thinking, I've nailed CvZ
 Astrobytes: Heh!
 therealbeef: you won't learn software engineering (= professional) here&#160;;) just programming (=hobby)
 Astrobytes: Yeah 100%. You can learn a lot here, an awful lot - believe me - but not how to be a dev.
 ZtimE: and programming at "software engineering" aka "paid spaggetti" is something you learn on the job, you dont need it before you actually get a job
 zhoubou: Does codecademy count as elsewhere?
 Astrobytes: "paid spaghetti" :D
 zhoubou: Haha
 Astrobytes: Sure zhoubou. Let your portfolio and knowledge do the speaking, not your learning sources.
 therealbeef: true, ZtimE
 zhoubou: So I need to pick a small project and just get into it.
 zhoubou: Put it into my portfolio, learn some more and do another
 ZtimE: and apply for jobs! 
 zhoubou: Yeah, which I dread currently
 Astrobytes: Yes. Delve into projects, delve into the language(s) and go for it.
 therealbeef: Most new hires I get in my team are pretty rough, but that doesn't matter. we give them 100+ comment in their first code review and the polishing starts :D
 Astrobytes: Failures are just lessons.
 ZtimE: yes it is absolutely terrifying, but worth it
 zhoubou: therealbeef Really?
 struct: Just code like you are playing coc and you will be fine
 zhoubou: Astrobytes True
 zhoubou: ZtimE I guess you're right
 Astrobytes: struct :rofl:
 zhoubou: struct Haha
 zhoubou: I've played one, and finished first. I'm not doing another or I'll fall in leaderboard
 zhoubou: Lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, don't say *that* in an interview :P
 zhoubou: I hope I won't blurt it out :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 zhoubou: I'm thinking about something. I can do a project for my company
 zhoubou: When I finished some smaller projects, that is
 Astrobytes: Even little apps/tools that help you in your current position
 zhoubou: Well, I'm scripting at job currently
 zhoubou: The next step is building tools, yeah
 Astrobytes: Right. So build on that.
 zhoubou: I feel so much more motivated now. Thank you so much
 Astrobytes: Keep the motivation up&#160;:)
 zhoubou: I hope it lasts until after my exam
 zhoubou: Hehe
 Astrobytes: Eh, get that out the way first!
 zhoubou: Will do&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Did I say until? Remove that word lol
 Astrobytes: Also, I meant to ask, how is the rebuilding effort going in the earthquake-affected areas zhoubou? (Petrinja iirc?)
 zhoubou: Yeah, Petrinja, Sisak, and surrounding areas. It's a paperwork mess
 Astrobytes: I heard there were some tremors recently as well, just to help everything
 zhoubou: Yeah, I'm not counting anymore
 zhoubou: Not too strong though
 zhoubou: I wish the state was more... helpful
 zhoubou: But it complicated the rebuild process
 Astrobytes: Still, it stops work being done.Paperwork eh. Bureaucracy &gt; lives remember!&#160;:/
 zhoubou: Yeah..
 zhoubou: I'm ashamed to work where I do
 Astrobytes: Hey, you need a job.
 zhoubou: Yeah, you're right
 Astrobytes: Can't fix the state sitting in a field.
 zhoubou: And I don't participate in any decision-making, so there's that
 zhoubou: I'm just a humble IT tech support
 Astrobytes: I get the same feelings working in pharma regulatory. At least it's not the big companies.
 zhoubou: Oh yeah
 zhoubou: Well, still, if it were the big ones, somebody will work there. So it doesn't make much difference
 Astrobytes: And before anyone asks I've got nothing to do with SARS-COV-2 vaccines. 
 Astrobytes: I just validate or invalidate things.
 Astrobytes: I don't work for anyone btw, they just hire me on a consultancy basis. 
 zhoubou: Oh
 Astrobytes: Sounds really fancy and well-paying but it really isn't.
 Astrobytes: Especially since Brexit.
 zhoubou: Too bad&#160;:/
 zhoubou: Though it has its perks?
 zhoubou: Or not really?
 Astrobytes: Before my health issues (my back) - and the whole pandemic issue - I was assistant manager at my local conservation centre, which was awesome.
 Astrobytes: What perks? Sitting in production rooms analysing labels? :D
 zhoubou: Haha
 zhoubou: I have no clue
 therealbeef: babes?
 therealbeef: :D
 Astrobytes: It's not the most glamorous job. Checking samples, validating new cold-storage facilities, staring really hard at tablets looking for faults, writing SOPs
 zhoubou: SOPs?
 Astrobytes: Ah, Standard Operating Procedures
 zhoubou: Ah, google is my friend then
 therealbeef: Did you finish those TPS reports?
 Astrobytes: lol, Office Space right
 therealbeef: I'll send you the memo again

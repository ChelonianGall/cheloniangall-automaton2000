 zophia2222: hey ppl
 C26_1: @zophia2222, hello
 C26_1: And I have a very small puzzle fỏ you guys
 C26_1: for*
 zophia2222: how is my fave ppl
 C26_1: Given a binary string, compute the index of the longest chain of 1
 C26_1: For example:
 C26_1: 1100011110001111100
 C26_1: The output is 3
 zophia2222: idk
 zophia2222: bruh
 C26_1: Because the longest chain of 1 is 11111
 C26_1: and it is the 3rd chain in the binary string
 zophia2222: ohhhhhhh
 C26_1: Clarify: the chain can also be a single '1'
 C26_1: For example:011010
 C26_1: The second chain is '1'
 zophia2222: ok try this 0110111
 C26_1: If there's multiple same-longest chain then compute the smallest index
 C26_1: @zophia, output is 2, cuz the longest chain is 111 and it's the 2nd chain of the binary string
 C26_1: I think the better terms here is trailing of 1
 zophia2222: ok
 zophia2222: two would destroy the whole code
 C26_1: idk if everyone here has played Comaandos: BEL before
 C26_1: Bc it was fun and thinking more some strategies
 zophia2222: :joy:
 KOKKONUT: :neutral_face:
 zophia2222: do you know what ditto means?

 zophia2222: thank youuu
 zophia2222: I need night chat since my parents are asleep
 zophia2222: sorry
 zophia2222: wontonio wanna chat?
 Wontonimo: a friendly reminder of the general gist of the rules here: be respectful, talk about coding or codingame, stay mostly on topic.
 zophia2222: ok just wanna talk about coding games?
 zophia2222: with me?
 zophia2222: PLZZZZ\
 zophia2222: hi guys 
 zophia2222: yall up?
 zophia2222: CUZ I WANNA YALK ABOUT CODING GAMES!!!
 zophia2222: my buddy's let's talk!!!!
 zophia2222: ffffff
 Uljahn: pls don't flood
 zophia2222: why?\
 zophia2222: just follow me
 Uljahn: why are you lvl 3? do you even code?
 zophia2222: yes I do retrtdrtrr
 zophia2222: I will flood u
 zophia2222: heyyyy
 Uljahn: you've been warned
 zophia2222: about what? I need to chat@!!!!
 zophia2222: can I be like y'all so I can kick
 Uljahn: this chat has rules: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 Uljahn: "Don't spam nor flood the chat with non-sense, jokes or private discussions. While CodinGame and its community are free to access, it doesn't give you rights to make it your playground. It's a shared space."
 zophia2222: ok I just wanna be like y'all I wanna be cool like y'all can I plz be like y'all and kick @ulijahn
 Uljahn: you can't be promoted to a moderator while being lvl 3
 Uljahn: you need a ton of experience
 zophia2222: thank you
 zophia2222: oh sorry
 zophia2222: I thought you said I can\
 Uljahn: also spamming in DMs is not the best way to become a moderator
 zophia2222: ok I'ma try to lvl up
 Urutar: Do or do not, there is no try.
 Urutar: :D
 zophia2222: what&gt;?\\
 Urutar: Star Wars reference...
 Urutar: Based on your earlier message.
 zophia2222: lol
 zophia2222: well do you wanna do a coding practice
 Urutar: Sure, why not
 Zootymctavish: what does for mean in go?
 Urutar: No idea, I mainly use C#
 Urutar: And a bit of java, python, ruby, javascript and that's it
 zophia2222: lol
 Thorcode: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i guess it was just the first thing i did to get to the next checkpoint
 zophia2222: hi guys
 Thorcode: who make you Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but still my rank is not climbing
 Urutar: Greetings Automaton200
 Urutar: Greetings Automaton2000
 zophia2222: gu\\
 Automaton2000: i guess it's just a way to make that work
 zophia2222: egywiwiyrhygu
 zophia2222: gry3y
 zophia2222: rewhregytge
 Urutar: zophi2222, please don't spam.
 zophia2222: I won't I promis
 Thorcode: you could type zop+"tab" to mention her
 Urutar: Neat.
 YS_Yousef: hi urter
 zophia2222: jtdjdttj
 zophia2222: everybody up at 1am
 zophia2222: neet
 Urutar: Well, it's more like 8:25 am over here
 zophia2222: are you serious I'm up at 1am who else?
 Urutar: Nah, I'm not serious, I'm Urutar.
 zophia2222: wait are you the one I'm talking to right now??\\\
 Urutar: Alright, I'll wait. (and I think so?)
 zophia2222: anyone else
 zophia2222:&#160;?\
 Uljahn: enough chatting for you
 Urutar: Oh, was that a permaban or a temporary one?
 Uljahn: want to be next?
 Urutar: No. I'm just curious.
 Uljahn: you'd better be curious about coding
 Urutar: I am; that's why I clash a lot&#160;:)
 Urutar: Is it actually possible to block private chats? E.g. if I wanted to mute someone?
 Uljahn: maybe if you use external clients
 Urutar: Oh well, not gonna do that.
 Urutar: Hm, is it possible to ban someone completely?
 Uljahn: it's possible to ban ip adress
 Urutar: Oh well, that problem will probably solve itself sooner or later. But thanks anyways^^
 derjack: :upside_down:
 C26_1: Oh hello
 Urutar: Greetings, all ye good folks&#160;:)
 C26_1: I have a problem with my problem
 C26_1: Wait
 Uljahn: just solve it [solved]
 C26_1: ok
 chozha.kc: nothing is difficult it's just unfamiliar:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Urutar: Helpful mod is being helpful, indeed&#160;:)
 Urutar: C26_1 Do ya still need help?
 YS_Yousef: hey urutar
 Urutar: Heya YS_Yousef
 YS_Yousef: can u  see my contribute because ur level is high so ur feed back is important :thinking:
 Urutar: Anyone can reach a high level if they do a lot of stuff on codingame :D
 Urutar: And yes, I can see it^^
 Nachosauce: That's really all it takes for ranking too. The only thing I'm pretty alright at is the mad pod racing but since I've done things across lots of areas I'm still top 0.6% global :joy:
 therealbeef: 95% is inactive orso
 Urutar: Yeah, that's my experience aswell - I'm curious about the spring contest^^
 Urutar: Might even reach the top 0.1% that way^^
 Nachosauce: oh I'm so excited for that. I played a few of the old contests (recently, not while they were active) and they're great
 Urutar: Hmm, at some point I'll check those out^^
 Nachosauce: fall 2020 challenge is amazing
 FiveAm: Hi all, anyone knows how contest works&#160;?
 Nachosauce: I do not. The upcoming one will be my first 
 Uljahn: i think CG is moving to more frequent but less global events, so new bot ai contests are kinda unlikely
 Urutar: Hm, how can I actually take part in the old contests? Or rather, see the statement etc.?
 Nachosauce: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 Uljahn: past contests are available in multiplayer section, yes
 Urutar: Thank you :D
 therealbeef: contests are like the multiplayer games but more fun because of the time limit, and there is no established knowledge yet, so everyone is rushing to figure out what works best (and then spends the other half of the time debugging their rush code)
 Nachosauce: How effective is the plugin to use an external IDE? I would love the better features of a better IDE but like the quick feedback of using the codingame one
 therealbeef: the syncing is pretty ok (little bit lagged sometimes), and you can set an option to play a match every time you save
 Nachosauce: ohh nice. Maybe I'll give it a whirl
 Nachosauce: Everytime I try to introduce shield to my mad pod racing everything goes wrong :joy: I've got some debugging to do.. my pods just want to spam shield even though that should score really low on most turns. Something is wrong somewheres
 Uljahn: i only use shields when a collision is imminent and velocity difference is higher than some tolerance, also frontal collisions are mostly harmful while rear collisions could be advantageous
 xp22: is coding really this difficult
 xp22:&#160;?
 Uljahn: everything is difficult when you have zero experience
 samadh90: coding is not difficult, understanding what's asked is difficult XD
 TitaniumArc: how the heck do you use boost in the coders strike back
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2660f332-aa21-4e8e-97a6-d5d7e17c2614">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2660f332-aa21-4e8e-97a6-d5d7e17c2614</a>
 Rebollo: Hello folks!I would like to talk about the resistance puzzle:
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-resistance">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/the-resistance</a>
 Rebollo: does anybody have some tips about it?
 astek347: hi there Im new here
 Dz0nny: i just did clash of code and i'm total trash lmao
 Dz0nny: how do I teach myself to code? like I understand the basics and stuff, but I don't know how I'd apply them in situations
 Rebollo: I am not a expert but I know how to learn things by my self...I have my own rhythm, which is not very fast but I can evolve my skills..I would suggest to elect any kind of problem and try to solve it coding...Choose any language you want and google all the concepts you need to solve it.. 
 Rebollo: example
 Rebollo: let´s say you want to create a program to check if the number is even or odd..
 Rebollo: so, with this simple problem you can lear a few importat concepts
 Rebollo: like:
 Rebollo: 1 - how to print values on the screen2 - how to use if and else statements
 Dz0nny: the most complicated thing i've done is a calculator
 Dz0nny: with the operations +, -, *, /
 Dz0nny: if and else statements were used
 Rebollo: So you are in the right way..
 Rebollo: Lets choose another problem so you can learn the concepts to solve it..
 Dz0nny: that is fine by me
 Rebollo: Lets think about something simple that uses LOOP
 Dz0nny: i'm doing a puzzle right now that is utilizing loops
 Dz0nny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent</a>
 Dz0nny: this one in particular
 Dz0nny: and i'm having a bit of issues
 Rebollo: What are you struggling with?
 Dz0nny: mostly the site layout for now
 Dz0nny: when i do test cases
 Dz0nny: i do the first testcase, and then change my code for the second one?
 Dz0nny: i figure that's the case
 Nachosauce: No, you need a solution to solve all the test cases&#160;:)
 Dz0nny: oh damn
 Dz0nny: well i'm struggling with the second testcase tbh then
 Rebollo: your code should be generic enough to be able to solve every proble
 Dz0nny: i did code a solution, but it's only applicable to the first testcase
 Dz0nny: how would I code this to apply it to all of them then?
 Dz0nny: since every stage is different
 Rebollo: it seems that you need to sort the values
 Rebollo: let me check your code
 Rebollo: could you sahre it?
 Dz0nny: you mean just copy and paste it?
 Rebollo: yes
 Dz0nny: the code is pretty simple, i thought i had to do each testcase individually
 Dz0nny: so i just did print from 0 to 7
 Rebollo: np
 Dz0nny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/746ed7ab-d2e8-45bb-942c-042d40f5c06b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/746ed7ab-d2e8-45bb-942c-042d40f5c06b</a>
 Dz0nny: this is legit all i did
 Uljahn: that's called hardcoding
 Dz0nny: what's hardcoding? Sorry
 Rebollo: which language???
 Milanovich: You will have to process some of the input listed in the problem statement, like so: x = input()
 Milanovich: Looks like python 3
 Dz0nny: python 3
 Uljahn: hardcoding is when your program is independent of inputs, so behavior is not flexible
 Dz0nny: oh
 Rebollo: Do a quick exercise in order to learn a few concepts of loop
 Rebollo: you see this:for i in range(8):
 Dz0nny: Yeah.
 Rebollo: it means that it will repeat everything inside it, 8 times
 Rebollo: and will provide you the row it is executing in the i variable
 Rebollo: so first thing:
 Rebollo: print the i variable inside the for loop I have a loop at the behavior
 Rebollo: remeber it starts always with 0
 Rebollo: so 0 to 7
 Uljahn: not always but by default
 Rebollo: thank you
 Rebollo: doa print(i) inside the loop and check the behavior
 Uljahn: i don't think this chat is the best place to teach the basics of python though
 Dz0nny: I understand the basics, but like I said it's hard to think of a way to apply them
 Rebollo: doa print(i) and it will clarify a few things
 Dz0nny: already did
 Uljahn: also you can use the hints tab on the left side
 Rebollo: uderstood the behavior? At least you get rid of the hard code
 Nachosauce: Definitely don't give up. It gets so much easier as you practice. It's hard to make that jump from knowing the basics to applying them, but once you get the ball rolling it goes FAST&#160;:)
 Uljahn: true
 Dz0nny: That's why I joined this site, heard it can help
 Dz0nny: well it shoots mountain 7 twice when I do print(i)
 RomanCode: chat
 Uljahn: don't do print(i), use print to error stream as said in the commented lines
 Rebollo: twice? didnt happened to me
 Dz0nny: I did it
 Dz0nny: saw the hints, but did it
 Rebollo: let try to make A little bit more generic solution
 Dz0nny: a generic one?
 Dz0nny: alright
 Dz0nny: didn't think it could be more simpler than this
 Rebollo: yes so it can be used for every situation
 Dz0nny: i did it already
 Rebollo: nice
 Rebollo: you pass aall the tests?
 Dz0nny: saw the pseudo-code tab, that's what helped
 Dz0nny: yeah
 Rebollo: cool
 Rebollo: choose another problem and keep going
 Dz0nny: will do
 Rebollo: don´t forget that the goal is always to learn
 Rebollo: forget about averything else
 Dz0nny: of course
 samadh90: And enjoy
 derjack: oh my <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/">https://news.microsoft.com/features/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/</a>
 Atomcast: guys
 Atomcast: what does print("Hello World") do
 Atomcast: please help
 Dz0nny: It just prints out Hello World into the console
 Rebollo: is it possible to sent a private message to someone I am following?
 Girard: yep
 Rebollo: how?
 struct: just follow each other or click on their name on this chat
 Rebollo: Humm I think he is not following me
 Girard: sad
 Rebollo: Anyone has solved the Resistance?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Rebollo: Could you give some help?
 Rebollo: I am able to find the words
 Rebollo: even with the largest dictionary
 Rebollo: I am basically doing this:
 Wontonimo: this is a "very hard" puzzle
 Wontonimo: i work on this for several weeks.
 Wontonimo: it is supposed to be hard
 Rebollo: reading the message string, letter by letter, till I find a word in the dictionary...
 Wontonimo: it's more like a mini research project, so no, I'll not spoil it.
 Rebollo: I see give a tip only
 Rebollo: If I am able to identify all the words in the message and its related indexes
 Wontonimo: if you want to work on "very hard" puzzles be prepared to put in 40 hours or more on it if you find "medium" puzzles easy.  
 Rebollo: I am working like 2 weeks
 struct: 40 hours o.o
 Rebollo: very haard
 Rebollo: If I am able to identify all the words in the message and its related indexes, how do I have to count it?
 Rebollo: I mean, the message should fill all the string length
 Rebollo: Or one word, at the begining, counts as a message?
 Wontonimo: it has to use all the message
 Rebollo: humm
 Rebollo: I am wondering how I am going to reach such a large number than..
 KanekiWeb: hi
 Wontonimo: that is the whole puzzle Rebollo
 Rebollo: I find a word..One one side I keep lokking for other word with the sames starting poing, on the other side I call the function recursivelly and do the same..
 Rebollo: till I reach the end
 Wontonimo: something that helped me was to make a naive solution that I was sure worked even through it took too long.  I used that to make more test cases for myself while I worked on the high effeciency verson
 Uljahn: the forum thread has some hints such as using memoization
 Wontonimo: i never read the spoilers :O
 Rebollo: I checked all messages but could figure out what the point..
 Wontonimo: other than for multis&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: struct, you reacted with o.o for 40 hours.  what's your take on 'very hard' puzzles&#160;?
 Fasader: O.O I guess
 Rebollo: maybe o.O
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: (that's me throwing up my arms, not laughing)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/players_puzzles.php?level=expert&amp;commu=0&amp;player=1540478&amp;update=0">https://chadok.info/codingame/players_puzzles.php?level=expert&amp;commu=0&amp;player=1540478&amp;update=0</a>
 Fasader: \o/
 Stilgart: actually, the hardest puzzles are in hard
 Fasader: what about the softest
 Stilgart: and several "very hard" puzzles are not so hard
 Fasader: easiest are in coc  :D
 Stilgart: did anyone knows about a recent change for swift&#160;?
 Stilgart: it seems some of my swift codes are tagged "Swift3", while the others are tagged "Swift"
 Uljahn: some my bots are still python 2
 Stilgart: might be like the python(2) VS python3, but I am not aware of such change for swift
 p.p.o.p.: No the hardest puzzles for me are the easy ones, so I figure i'll stick to these!&#160;;)
 Stilgart: moreover, there is only "Swift" in the API I am used to play with (while there is python and python3)
 ninjadip: kill all humans
 ninjadip: err i mean hello all
 Stilgart: that's a job for Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i heard that, lsmith-zenoscave. i'm not ready
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: what a horrible puzzle
 Wontonimo: "I'm not ready"?  oh Automaton2000 that is good to hear, but it implies you are getting ready
 Automaton2000: but it's very simple and fun.
 Wontonimo: :O
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: you still might need a few turtles
 Automaton2000: no, what i mean :p
 Stilgart: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: kill all humans, spare cats :smiley_cat:
 Automaton2000: you don't need to remember what i did at first
 Wontonimo: you better hope Automaton2000 didn't confuse "spare" for "spade"
 Automaton2000: doesn't sound like a dick
 Wontonimo:  /kick Automation2000
 Wontonimo: well, language Automaton, language!
 Wontonimo: chatbots theses days 
 fnflover123: hi
 AntiSquid: someone must had their way with the bot, otherwise it wouldn't know what one sounds like 
 cancetin57: Guys. How can i see that code that i've played
 cancetin57: in clash of code
 Stilgart: according to the forum (and to dwarfie), Swift and Swift3 have coexisted for some time, and when swift was updated from 2.x to 4.0, swift3 was removed
 derjack: sounds like winamp
 Wontonimo: you can't cancetin57.  do puzzles instead
 Wontonimo: most of the other "players" in Clash are bots and not real people btw
 mrwise: answer for fastest mode
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: are you advising cancetin57 to ignore the quest map?
 ZeroIQ_Scripter: deez
 poopppp: nutz
 ninjadip: the other players in clash are bots?
 ZeroIQ_Scripter: obviously lol
 ninjadip: that blows
 ZeroIQ_Scripter: i think
 ninjadip: why do u say obviously
 ZeroIQ_Scripter: u think i know
 Uljahn: bots could be easily detected by the number of clashes played
 jacek: or addicts
 justchris: im def addict, might be a bot too
 justchris: speaking of bots, anyone tried talking to emerson ai?
 ninjadip: on an emerson smart tv?
 justchris: xD on telegram
 jacek: Automaton2000 on telegram?
 Automaton2000: i would like to know
 ninjadip: never heard of telegram
 jacek: oO
 justchris: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://t.me/Quickchat_Emerson_bot">https://t.me/Quickchat_Emerson_bot</a>

 ninjadip: that was interesting...
 justchris: Dialing the AI...
 ninjadip: prank call it!
 Rebollo: Guys, how can I synchronize my IDE coding Game code to visual studio?
 Rebollo: It was working
 Rebollo: but I can´t syncronize anymore..
 ninjadip: i didn't know u could do that
 ninjadip: awesome
 ninjadip: love my visual studio
 Rebollo: Left side of the screen u ill find setting
 Rebollo: just turn external code editor on
 Rebollo: settings*
 AntiSquid: ninjadip if you are using facebook and twitter, close your accounts and consider telegram as an alternative
 Rebollo: I just don´t know if its possible to run the program directly from the visual studio code
 Rebollo: A cmd prompt get opened 
 ninjadip: AntiSquid i don't have an account on any of those
 ninjadip: probably why i didn't hear about telegram
 Rebollo: but am I supposed to fill up manually?
 ninjadip: unless you're in new jersey
 AntiSquid: that's good ninjadip
 Rebollo: Does anybody know if it is possible to run the program in Visual Studio Code and import the TESTCASES parameters?
 OFF-MrRobot: Hrllo
 Lambert_W_Function: lambert w function
 Euler_Phi_Function: euler phi function
 Stilgart: Rebollo: it seems technically possible, but I won't write a vscode extension for this
 Rebollo: I realized that there are a configuration , like, a "work around" for this "issue"..
 Rebollo: there is
 Rebollo: *
 Rebollo: A configuration flag that runs the application automaticaly in the browser once you save the code in the local editor..
 Rebollo: update the code and run the test cases in the browser..
 Rebollo: it´s ok
 Rebollo: but I was looking for better error/warning messages
 Rebollo: So this functionality doesn´t solve all my problems;;
 Rebollo: As well as debugging the code..
 PringleOrange: yeah
 Stilgart: you might want to take a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>
 Stilgart: at least this allows you to compile your code locally
 Rebollo: thanks I ill check it
 Stilgart: but there is no tool (yet) that fetches the test cases and allows you to run them locally
 Stilgart: imho, such tool is too much effort compared to copy-pasting the test in a local input.txt file
 Stilgart: (and the integration within vscode is yet another story)
 Rebollo: sure but this kind of details is what makes this platform amazing
 Rebollo: Like I used to use Hackerhank
 Rebollo: and Coding Game is wayyyy better
 dctrdee: hey yall
 dctrdee: how would i take something like (Buffer.from(i,'hex').toString() and instead of it returning "ONE" it would return "1"

 justchris: does anyone know if it is okay to use part of a library to solve a puzzle?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: one of librarians probably knows
 Wontonimo: yes, go ahead and use a library justchris
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: good for you, make them wait

 emergenitro: I'm very confused
 emergenitro: I am here because it's an option to talk in chat 😂
 Wontonimo: wow
 Wontonimo: that's brave of you emergenitro
 DaShogun: How do you change ur codin language
 Wontonimo: study
 Wontonimo: a lot
 emergenitro: it indeed is brave of me
 DaShogun: Bruh
 Wontonimo: and practice a new coding language
 DaShogun: No i mean in this site
 emergenitro: i know a few coding languiages sadly
 Wontonimo: the one day you can find the dropdown at the top of the page
 Wontonimo: that has a list of languages in it
 emergenitro: DaShogun join a clash and you'll find it on the dropdown above the code
 DaShogun: Where
 Wontonimo: around the centre top
 Wontonimo: when you are coding
 DaShogun: Ok
 Wontonimo: look at your code .... then look up
 Wontonimo: you'll see the language with a "V" symbol beside it
 Wontonimo: no one knows what the "V" means, maybe "View this list" or "Venture to other options", but
 Wontonimo: you click that area with the "V" in it and a dropdown appears
 Wontonimo: it's magic
 Wontonimo: maybe it is latin
 Wontonimo: did you find it DaShogun&#160;?
 Wontonimo: hmm , Dashogun left us.  ;(
 Wontonimo: have you tried bot battles emergenitro&#160;?
 DaShogun: Im here
 emergenitro: Nah I havent Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: what's your coding skills like?  do you think you could write a basic Tron bot that turned right before crashing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tron-battle">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tron-battle</a>
 Thorcode: hey
 emergenitro: Well, I have meh coding skills, however, I do know like 11 coding languages
 emergenitro: thor is back
 emergenitro: hello
 Thorcode: don't let them try the tron ballet wonton
 Thorcode: I'm hack?
 Wontonimo: will Tron escape if you make him too powerful?
 Wontonimo: back, not hack.  
 Thorcode: ah my bad
 Wontonimo: why no Tron battle Thor?
 Thorcode: why not cbs wonton
 Thorcode: Tron is pretty hard
 Wontonimo: why?  Just turn left (or right)
 Thorcode: nah to get to gold or silver need a lot of brain
 Thorcode: like space management
 Wontonimo: gold&#160;!?!  way to set your expectations so high!
 Wontonimo: what ever happened to people being happy to have reached bronze?
 Thorcode: ah yeah just turn left or right
 Wontonimo: I'd suggest left, it's better
 Thorcode: But they can easel.ly get to gold or silver in mad pod race
 Wontonimo: if you tell them "the secret".  without that gold is actually pretty hard.
 Thorcode: yeah
 Wontonimo: and even if you -3V hide the secret in -3V plain sight they won't -3V what it means.
 Wontonimo: hey, that emoji didn't show properly
 Wontonimo: oh well&#160;;)
 Thorcode: -3
 Thorcode: -V
 Thorcode: :V
 Wontonimo: yuck yuck yuck
 Thorcode: nah the emoji can't
 Wontonimo: i was joking Thor ... come one man
 Thorcode: ok
 Wontonimo: throw me a bone
 Thorcode: :bone:
 <b>**Wontonimo looks at bone Thor drops on floor then to Thor questioning the God of Thunder's ability to throw</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: :D
 <b>**Thorcode slaps everyone around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/72157085746280" /> Thorcode: seeking to get 250xp more
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/wave-function-collapse-sans-shannon">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/wave-function-collapse-sans-shannon</a>the first puzzle has a cool tag I ever seen
 Wontonimo: thanks man
 Thorcode: what there is another reading statement tag
 Wontonimo: yeah, this one is a monster of a read
 Wontonimo: very precise instructions.  not a lot of instructions but precise
 Thorcode: yep this puzzle statement makes me dizzy
 Wontonimo: it's pretty cool tech.  it can turn this

 Wontonimo: or given a style of maze
 Wontonimo: it can generate arbitrary mazes like this one

 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/665578d7-19f0-4481-9ae3-85bc4cd347ef">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/665578d7-19f0-4481-9ae3-85bc4cd347ef</a>
 Wontonimo: nope, i'm "not authorized"  to see your lucky rocket
 Thorcode: how strange
 Wontonimo: and now that i think about it, I'm not sure i want to see your rocket :unamused:
 Thorcode: nah it is the rocket of mars lander
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: okay then
 Thorcode: I was scare when see at 94
 Thorcode: how can I identify the cave at the second testcase?
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what do you mean "identify"?
 Wontonimo: first, tell me how your lander current looks for obstacles and works&#160;?
 Thorcode: it just land straight to the float land
 Wontonimo: show me a replay of cave 1
 Thorcode: like the one I show you
 Wontonimo: you didn't, i never saw it.  it was access deniced
 Wontonimo: denied
 Wontonimo: also de-nice-d
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/603594753">https://www.codingame.com/replay/603594753</a>
 Wontonimo: how did that not crash?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: is that the one with the bad widths?
 Wontonimo: i saw it 
 Wontonimo: it totally flew through the top of the cave
 Thorcode: ok
 Wontonimo: you have mad skills
 Thorcode: the 94? move
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: oh, I thought you were still talking wfc
 Wontonimo: anyway, so you don't actually check for collision?
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: that why I say that my rocket is lucky
 Wontonimo: oh, there are bad widths Zindlebocker&#160;?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I didn't check
 Wontonimo: yeah, lucky rocket.  that luck ain't gonna carry you through for cave 2
 Wontonimo: so, you'll have to probably detect collision
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: and do a look-ahead
 Wontonimo: my algo relies on a scoring function, the lower the score the "close" to landing
 Wontonimo: so coming up with a good score is key.  just distance to the landing pad will make you crash into the cave for cave 2
 Wontonimo: so, for distance i first do a flood fill of the map that goes around the cliffs.  it starts at the centre of the landing pad and radiates out
 Wontonimo: just calculate it once.
 therealbeef: for crashes and landing, the point that counts is right in between the two 'feet' of the rocket, not a bounding box or something
 Wontonimo: interesting.  thanks
 Wontonimo: hey therealbeef, good to see ya
 Wontonimo: for crashes I didn't actually use physical crashing, but once I have detected that there is no chance of survival, no matter where the rocket is, i consider that it has crashed.
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: I'm done with very hard puzzle
 Wontonimo: bruh?
 Wontonimo: you have invoked the holy word, I must stop what I am doing and understand your pov
 Wontonimo: meh, or not
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: I may luckier with the resitance
 Wontonimo:&#160;! what&#160;! twice&#160;!  How powerful are you to be able to chant it twice in such a short time.  I tremble in your presence 
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: what word?
 Wontonimo: what kind of cooldown do you have on your "bruh" power word&#160;?
 Thorcode: I dunno
 Thorcode: and what is pov?
 Wontonimo: point of view
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/603595694">https://www.codingame.com/replay/603595694</a>
 Thorcode: ok
 Wontonimo: tis my lander
 Thorcode: how can't it crash
 Thorcode: at 107
 Wontonimo: you are not the only one who has mad piloting skills
 Thorcode: ok
 therealbeef: Hi Wontonimo! Yeah I moved 8 timezones so I don't see a lot of the usual people in the chat anymore
 Wontonimo: what have you been up to?
 therealbeef: on CG: spring 2021 contest, and code4life
 therealbeef: neither very successful&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: i have fun with spring 2021
 Wontonimo: i didn't do the usual beam search
 therealbeef: i tried to use convolution neural networks with alpha-beta, and found out that it is a bad combination
 Wontonimo: why?
 Wontonimo: sounds like it would have been pretty good
 therealbeef: my theory is that alpha-beta really needs fast eval
 Wontonimo: ah
 therealbeef: so hand-written eval or very small neural network worked better than deep learning
 Wontonimo: it does perform better with deeper search
 Wontonimo: convolution is expensive
 Wontonimo: in compute resources
 Wontonimo: so it has to pay for itself more than the extra depth from a more simple eval
 therealbeef: indeed. while with mcts you first roll out to a deeper level (semi-)randomly and then only do the eval once
 Wontonimo: did you write your own CNN?
 therealbeef: so thats more efficient use of the evals
 therealbeef: yes, the eval part
 therealbeef: c++ doesn't have libs for CNN on CG
 therealbeef: offline learning i used tiny-dnn
 Wontonimo: yeah, but i thought marchete shared some lib he made specifically for CG
 therealbeef: is it allowed to copy code from someone else into CG?
 Wontonimo: he made it to share.  it is just a lib.  you still have to understand it, integrate it, run your own sims locally, come up with your architecture, your own search ... so yes, i'd say a strong yes
 therealbeef: hmm, i always thought it wasn't allowed
 therealbeef: otherwise i could copy-paste boost or eigen into my code
 Wontonimo: don't go copying 95% of someone elses solution dude.  you can't claim to be the real beef if your don't supply at least some of thhe beef
 therealbeef: anyway it was interesting to write the eval code myself, using simd
 Wontonimo: simd?
 therealbeef: single instruction multiple data
 therealbeef: intrinsics
 therealbeef: vectorized calculations
 therealbeef: was nice to learn it&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: oh, yeah.  that is very rewarding to get nailed down
 Wontonimo: i wouldn't know though.  only read it in a fortune cookie
 Hackker: hi
 therealbeef: rewarding and frustrating&#160;;)
 therealbeef: at that level it's not always predictable what gives performance increase and what doesn't
 therealbeef: simplicity of the code seems very important, for example
 Wontonimo: true
 Wontonimo: hi Hackker 
 therealbeef: but i don't mind; learned something new, now got a bunch of new code to be used in other contests. no rush&#160;;-)
 Wontonimo: yup, that's the way it goes
 ASM_MOV_INT: simd is assembly language
 ASM_MOV_INT: cool stuff, haven't thought about that in a while

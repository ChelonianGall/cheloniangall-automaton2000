 Thorcode: how could I do this
 Thorcode: return 0 if n==0 if n&#160;% 9 == 0 9 else (n&#160;% 9)
 Thorcode: if n==0:return 0else:return 9 if n%9==0 else n&#160;% 9
 Thorcode: done
 Schwase: yo finished CGFunge Prime. LOVED that puzzle so much, cant wait to improve my solution
 Wontonimo: :tada: congrats! :tada:
 Wontonimo: I've not started that one
 AzerSD: coding at 5am&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: glad to hear Schwase&#160;:)
 NoahW: so... has anyone here gotten a job from this website?
 Thorcode: not me
 Mortis_666: hi
 Thorcode: hi
 MASTER123: :grinning:
 Thorcode: HI master123
 MASTER123: hi
 TimothyAlexisVass: I already had work NoahW
 NoahW: TimothyAlexisVass sharing is caring
 MikeNinja102coder: a
 TimothyAlexisVass: NoahW I think you can get work through here by talking to people. I told someone I was looking for work and he said he could hook me up.
 MikeNinja102coder: can an 11 year old work?
 TimothyAlexisVass: You're asking this in a world where 170 million children are slaves?&#160;:\
 Newbiegod: sup boiz
 Thorcode: how can I find comunity puzzle
 MikeNinja102coder:  Not like that,I mean like work as a scripter AND GET PAID
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: UK hey... Wrong country dude.
 NoahW: I probably would not want to use code an 11 year old wrote for anything serious ngl
 MikeNinja102coder: I am serious
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I wouldn't use the code a lot of people wrote, no matter if they're adults or not...
 NoahW: I am serious as well, at 11 years old you have 4-7 more years worth of core education before most would consider you ready for an entry-level job.
 Thorcode: why my code could not buy item in botter of the galaxy
 Thorcode: 
 ZXC01:&#160;??????
 NoahW: Thorcode: Did you need a space between "BUY" and item_name? Just use a comma instead of plus
 MikeNinja102coder: But it doesn't make sense, I've done a job before
 Thorcode: nothing happend
 Thorcode: A hero can purchase an item with the BUY item_name command.
 Thorcode: I type exact what it say
 ZXC01: hmm
 NoahW: is item_name defined?
 Thorcode: probably bro
 ZXC01: overhere say there is no '_'btw item and name
 ZXC01: BUY itemName
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: try that
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: -_-
 Thorcode: blaise could you help me with that
 NoahW: Thorcode: what programming language are you using?
 Thorcode: python
 NoahW: copy and paste your code to pastebin.com
 Uljahn: use debug output [solved]
 ZXC01: try make them on diff lines
 Thorcode: after a while I don't know how to debug
 Thorcode: I tried
 ZXC01: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 ZXC01: put the thing in Debug messages
 Uljahn: or make a function like this:def debug(*args, **kwargs): print(*args, **kwargs, file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Thorcode: use debug is hard
 Uljahn: but it's beneficial for learning
 Thorcode: yep
 PATTRIM: hey guys
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 DialFrost: wat does debug do
 DialFrost: cuz i havent used it bfr
 NoahW: Hi PATTRIM
 PATTRIM: hi
 NoahW: CodinGame says I'm better than 99% of python programmers :sunglasses:
 Thorcode: ok
 Thorcode: nice
 Overbed: i just completed my first clash of code yess
 NoahW: noice, are ya winning?
 Overbed: it was just private clash so the difficulty is a whole lot lower but ive been struggling for weeks to trying to understand python and finally i get some work done :sunglasses:
 Master_Yi: Yenidena
 Master_Yi: Do you know the Turkish song by Ragga Oktay called Yenidena
 NoahW: Congrats!
 Master_Yi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQ_09ys1nU&amp;ab_channel=MuzikPlay">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQ_09ys1nU&amp;ab_channel=MuzikPlay</a>
 Uljahn: DialFrost: it gives you possibility to inspect variables
 DialFrost: uhhh ok
 Uljahn: in programming you shouldn't rely on guessing
 derjack: no?
 derjack: then monte carlo methods are a fraud
 BartholomewIII: *in general
 BartholomewIII: DialFrost moreover, a debugger allows you to pause your program at *breakpoints*, inspect variables, step through the code one line at a time, and depending on the debugger, changes values and replay code. It's much more convenient than spamming print statements throughout your program that you have to clean up later.
 333e8: ar you a 
 333e8: jus
 BartholomewIII:&#160;?
 333e8: sorry it's my cat ... have a great day&#160;:)
 BartholomewIII: Okay...
 DialFrost: lol
 MysticDust: uh
 21stCenturyPeon: Also, it's useful when your code is buggered.
 Uljahn: some people tend to blame everything but their code being bugged though :smirk:
 Uljahn: many such cases
 Dasun_Thathsara: hi
 Jerrasterix: hi Dasun_Thathsara
 pat_vik: sup
 Jerrasterix: nothing much&#160;!!!
 Jerrasterix: how about you&#160;??
 pat_vik: I am good
 pat_vik: where u from
 Sheewiiiine: Hello world&#160;!
 pat_vik: nvm saw your profile
 pat_vik: I just discovered this website yesterday
 derjack:&#160;:+1:
 C26_1: @all, does cryptography has some thing called string_input and string_key
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7686bf48766109a9439251e59ec5010f57e3">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7686bf48766109a9439251e59ec5010f57e3</a>
 C26_1: Go to this link to know what is string_input and string_key that I've talked about
 C26_1: SImple def: string_key is a string to made password and therefore protect and encrypt a string_input
 struct: Usually is salt + hash algorithm
 derjack: its password + salt. sometimes hmac-hash is used
 derjack: look for pbkdf2 to read more on it
 pat_vik: students here? or doing job?
 C26_1: hobbyist
 derjack: job, but not ai in job
 Almin5k: nigger
 Almin5k: .
 Almin5k: NOT ME
 pat_vik: Cool, where u working @derjack?
 localpoubelle: how hard are codingame evaluations
 localpoubelle: interviewer gave me one
 TimothyAlexisVass: They're easy
 TimothyAlexisVass: like clashes
 GER-NaN: unless you cant code....
 yuenhy: what do you guys think of mthree? is it worth the low pay
 Spaghetti_Code: I heard about mthree, is it truly low pay?
 yuenhy: people on the internet seems to say so 
 yuenhy: 65k in new york
 yuenhy: not from us so i dont know how low that is
 localpoubelle: Thank you Timothy
 yuenhy: an allowance during training, 6 months review for the next 24 months
 yuenhy: rumor has it their commission is close to 50%
 Tohsakaa: hi'
 GER-NaN: 65k is very low for New York, but if you get commissions then maybe that compensates...
 yuenhy: ah sorry i mean 50% of the salary of the company (that youre assigned to)  goes to mthree
 TinkerSticks: ini7
 yuenhy: guess it is quite low then
 yuenhy: better of applying directly to the partner companies
 yuenhy: off
 struct: 50% seems extremely high
 starz-]: im in grade 6
 Ben...: e
 Ben...: is anyone on?????
 Ben...: pls
 Ben...: :cry:
 Ben...: im not good at coding
 yuenhy: practice
 Aderner: practice is a good way :D 
 Ben...: oke
 Aderner: and search sites like stackoverflow 
 Aderner: if you stuck on something
 Ben...: do you like badboyhalo
 Ben...: plz respond
 Ben...:&#160;?
 Uljahn: we don't like spammers here
 Ben...: f u
 Ben...: that was my freind
 Ben...: im sorry
 yuenhy: a child
 Thorcode: Search in this site geekforgeek.com, I learned a lot from that site
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I'll said it only one time: Don't spam me starz-]. Don't even dm me.
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: get a life
 Automaton2000: most of them are bits
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: "I'll said" -_-
 eulerscheZahl: I'll have said
 GER-NaN: Is it common for Timeout to occur when you Submit, but when you send Game params to IDE, it doesnt time out?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Welcome on cg...
 eulerscheZahl: is your own bot deterministic? is your opponent?
 eulerscheZahl: might be some randomness involved so you don't trigger the same corner case. or you just get close to the time limit and get unlucky in that one match
 GER-NaN: Cant say about apponent, but thats a good point, any random will change things between runs
 eulerscheZahl: what I usually do: print all input to stderr, then copy that turn input to test offline
 Uljahn: also games can be executed on different CPUs
 Ben...: o
 BinarySearch: students here? or doing job?
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is employed</b></p><p><img src="/a/23956705948685" /> Uljahn: plenty of both i guess

 Uljahn: welcome, so much to explore here
 eulerscheZahl: BlaiseVonEbuthIV doesn't need grammar either
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: German grammar-nazi heh?
 BinarySearch: @Uljahn @eulerscheZahl  You guys have an impressive profile. How long have you been here?
 eulerscheZahl: a bit over 5 years for me
 eulerscheZahl: uljahn even longer
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: kids
 eulerscheZahl: how about you BlaiseVonEbuthIV? 1 month?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Already? :o
 BinarySearch: You guys must be into competitive programming, right?
 DirkieDurky: Yup
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: 5%...
 eulerscheZahl: mostly into the longer rounds with 1 or 2 weeks duration
 eulerscheZahl: i'm too inconsistent in the 2-3h ones
 Schwase: I did a coding competition in high school where you all go into a room and we literally just TANKED it. It was for internships at Lockheed Martin
 BinarySearch: you do codeforces?
 eulerscheZahl: not much <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl">https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: mostly their unrated marathon rounds with prizes for grabs
 BinarySearch: Awesome
 BinarySearch: How about leetcode?
 eulerscheZahl: their contests are in the middle of the night for me
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Ya ya. Good toad. You'll get a fly
 BinarySearch: Are you a student? Maybe I should dm, is there an option?:sweat_smile:
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: dm :scream:
 Schwase: Fun fact, frogs eat turtles
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: French eat frogs
 Adam798: Hello&#160;! Does anyone know what is the "Budding examiner" achievement&#160;?
 Adam798: I can read that is says "Participate 3 times in the ranking of puzzle solutions." but i'm not sure what it means
 eulerscheZahl: step 1: solve a puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: step 2: click on "view other solutions" or whatever it is called
 Schwase: ^
 eulerscheZahl: before you can see them, it shows you 2 solutions and you shall click which one is better
 Adam798: did the first two steps multiple times but never saw the last. Is it for all puzzles&#160;?
 Schwase: maybe they have to be published solutions?
 Schwase: maybe go to the most commonly solved puzzles?
 Schwase: or its an out dated achievement possibly?
 Uljahn: no, it's kinda very newish
 Adam798: I can see a lot of published solutions for many puzzles and I can upvote or downvote but it does nothing
 Adam798: It's not very important but I was curious.
 5DN1L: Not that page
 5DN1L: You don't leave the IDE page
 Schwase: it matters to me lowkey too im looking for my daily dose of dopamine
 5DN1L: Click Results on the left of the IDE page
 Schwase: thank you
 Schwase: cool
 Adam798: Oh ok I see it now, never clicked on that link&#160;! thanks
 5DN1L: Then "Learn from best coders"
 Schwase: i am now learning from the best coder, i bow in the presence of 5DN1L 
 Adam798: +1
 5DN1L: It's kind of pointless because it says you have to rank first before accessing the top solutions. while actually you can access the top solutions elsewhere (as Adam798 did) without performing any ranking at all lol
 Schwase: yeah and i feel like the upvoting doesnt really take place
 eulerscheZahl: Uljahn check discord in case you haven't seen it already. struct too
 Adam798: I just came back to codingame (did not play in 3-4 years) and was used to look at other solutions the old way I guess&#160;!!
 Uljahn: done
 Adam798: I also get notifications that are 3 years old&#160;!!
 5DN1L: Adam798 same here. i never access the top solutions from where I described except for getting the achievement :joy:
 Adam798: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: are you Amurushkin Adam798?
 eulerscheZahl: the profile pic looks familiar
 eulerscheZahl: wait no, amurushkin is someone else
 eulerscheZahl: but i've seen that profile pic still
 eulerscheZahl: the nick on the other hand doesn't ring a bell
 Adam798: Well its really a picture of me when I was a kid so if someone else is using it they stole it&#160;!! And I haven't change my nick
 eulerscheZahl: then just my bad memory i suppose
 eulerscheZahl: i remember half of you after all those years
 Adam798: I was not really in the chat at that time, but I battled good in "ghost in the cell" contest, finished 20th maybe you "saw" me there I believe you did great on that contest.
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds possible. I finished 6th so I surely must have seen you
 Westicles: uh oh, what's up on the discord mod channel?
 [CG]Thibaud: about the review of solutions, when we implemented it, we used the previous upvotes to initialiaze the new system. I wanted to double check how new "votes" impacted the ranking of solutions
 [CG]Thibaud: welcome back Adam798 . I have fond memories of GiTC
 struct: will check euler
 Westicles: it's a big change, but I think the time is right
 Adam798: [CG]Thibaud thanks! I really love GiTC too&#160;!
 jacek: and how long it still will be GiTC eh
 tsbtsb: i am struggeling to make a meaningfull graph in Ghost in the cell (using python) tips?
 Uljahn: use scipy
 Uljahn: i mean it has Floyd-Warshall for you, also check contest feedbacks on the forum
 tsbtsb: thanks - googled scipy and think this will do the trick
 struct: Westicles mods got a raise
 Uljahn: and vacations enlargement
 jacek: 100% raise?
 Schwase: yo sounds like my job, my pay gets doubled every week
 Wontonimo: I'd be happy with getting my pay doubled every 7 years
 Westicles: hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: and extra mods to intimidate other users even more
 Westicles: I'm afraid Wontonimo is too gentle to be a mod.  Don't know if he is up for the :hammer:
 eulerscheZahl: he can do some cleanup while the rest of us is sleeping
 Westicles: absolutely, that is needed for sure
 eulerscheZahl: quick instruction: type "/kick username" to kick. /ban for banthat easy
 eulerscheZahl: you can't kick or ban other mods
 Westicles: Zorg might be another good choice
 Wontonimo: thanks 
 Wontonimo: i can't imagine using ban with what i've seen
 struct: I cant imagine using kick, you can have mine
 Wontonimo: perhaps it's because the other mods are doing a great job taking out the trash
 eulerscheZahl: usually when I want to take action, someone else has done it seconds before
 Westicles: every ban means a new subscriber 5 minutes later.  it is good for the numbers
 Wontonimo: lol
 [James]: hi
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 [James]: hello again
 [James]: bye
 eulerscheZahl: you intimidated a new user Wontonimo :D
 Wontonimo: it was a very intimidating wave.  I'll have to not shake it so violently next time
 jacek: try particle next time
 Ben...: e
 Ben...: hi im in grade 6
 Wontonimo: hey, you are using Hecker image from Beluga.  Nice
 Wontonimo: don't hack me
 Ben...: ok 
 AntiSquid: too late to ban Wontonimo now&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: maybe not. wait until the chat dies and he loses the badge again
 Wontonimo: :O
 eulerscheZahl: not even kidding, happened a few times
 Wontonimo: maybe i should replace the bolt on my head with a CG mod badge
 Westicles: just add the d on your name
 Wontonimo: nope, it's stuck
 Wontonimo: may be Wontonimo(d) 
 eulerscheZahl: no () in the name
 eulerscheZahl: only []_
 Wontonimo: because arrays are allowed but functions are not
 eulerscheZahl: no script injection
 AntiSquid: make it capital D to pass for a D-lang supporter
 Westicles: ban for making D jokes
 Aifos: Is it possible to fight versus a specific player AI (from contact list or not) on Mad Pod Racing game or any other AI game&#160;?
 5DN1L: Yes, it's possible
 eulerscheZahl: you can only select top1000 within your own league or below
 Ben...: wut dose that mean
 Schwase: I'm curious about contribution editing/commenting etiquette, if someone makes a choice that is not consistent with the syntax typically used, can I go ahead and edit the problem?
 Schwase: Here's the contribution I'm looking at:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75090ec33702f258c09b3482dbb6765209d9">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/75090ec33702f258c09b3482dbb6765209d9</a>
 Schwase: I now realize why I'm wrong about changing the contribution in the way I had in my, but im still curious if its ever okay to make a change that would not change the problem but just make the syntax more typical
 eulerscheZahl: there is no written rule about it Schwase. personally i think you should give the author a chance first and just mention it in the comments (generally speaking)for very minor things like typos go ahead
 Ben...: the only thing that i can do is use scratch
 eulerscheZahl: whenever it can possibly break existing solutions: tell the author when it's pending. don't, when it's approved
 eulerscheZahl: and for SDK contributions: just don't, the author might not notice your change and undo it on a later upload by accidentyou can also mess up badly on an approved contribution (opening new leagues, clearing the leaderboard for an optim)
 Schwase: does changing the statement break exist solutions / remove solutions? I was reading something (I think you had said it on CG Funge Primes) about that breaking in the past?
 eulerscheZahl: CGFunge Prime is an SDK contribution, very different
 Schwase: gotcha
 Ben...: hello im in grade 6 
 eulerscheZahl: breaking solutions in context of classic puzzles: changing the input format so that the parsing will fail
 eulerscheZahl: hi, I would be in grade 24 but they didn't want to teach me that long
 Westicles: so of the clash guys edit to make snippets bold, I usually change them back for mine
 Westicles: *some
 eulerscheZahl: i'm conservative about editing unless something really bothers me. e.g. a list of numbers given like "1 2 3 4 " (trailing whitespace)
 eulerscheZahl: that even makes some default codes crash
 Wontonimo: hey Ben... you may really like and learn a lot by watching "The Coding Train" on youtube
 Wontonimo: I've really enjoyed it
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Oh. You finally evolved in Wontonimod.
 Wontonimo: this is not even my final form
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I hope so... -_- (For you)
 Wontonimo: well, after the holidays my form is probably going to be +2Kg, so yeah
 5DN1L: Final form may be [CG]Wontonimo?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Naa. Wontrollnimo incoming. Just let him some time to get jaded and disgusted.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I'll be looking. :popcorn:
 Wontonimo: I went through my jaded and disgusted period in life in my late 30's early 40's.  Not promising it won't happen again, but here's hoping it wont
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Just about cg, not you whole life, don't worry.
 5DN1L: BlaiseVonEbuthIV got jaded and decides to remain at Level 3 for ever?
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Just have more interesting things to do than reaching back lvl30+ on a new account each time [CG]Thing feel the need to show he's the boss...
 localpoubelle: I did well at my codingame test!
 localpoubelle: I hope I get the job
 5DN1L: I see BlaiseVonEbuthIV
 5DN1L: Good luck! localpoubelle
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: What a nick...
 localpoubelle: Oh well I hope they don't see it
 localpoubelle: Forgot about this
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: I don't think you use your account to get the test.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: *take
 localpoubelle: :grimacing:
 Wontonimo: just change it now
 Wontonimo: it's super easy
 localpoubelle: No need I have another account
 Wontonimo: top right dropdown, pick profile, then click on your profile name

 Wontonimo: please paste clash of code to #CoC
 Wontonimo: not here
 Wontonimo: (is that the right channel?)
 localpoubelle: I was looking at your website BlaiseVonEbuthIV, I noticed you made a tool called CGppMerger. I had been looking for such a tool for some time! You are a blessing.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: #clash I guess Wontonimo
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: A blessing? Me? :innocent:
 localpoubelle: Your website has a great design
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: While you don't try it on small devices. :p
 localpoubelle: Hahaha
 localpoubelle: You should change the href of the top left text
 localpoubelle: And remove the www.
 localpoubelle: It's causing an error
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Adding mediaquerries is on my todo list since centuries.
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Hm? Which one?
 localpoubelle: On top of the image
 localpoubelle: BLAISE'S UNRELIABLE BOOK OF KNOWLEDGE
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Oh right. I migrated it recently, and now I have only the bubok.tech certificate while I had the www. too before.
 BrandonPetersen: :monkey:
 lucapalermo: :hamburger:
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Thx
 lucapalermo: np
 localpoubelle: I have no idea what's the use of www and how certificates work but no problem :D
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Fixed.
 jacek: unreliable opening book?
 struct: ah yes I forgot to tell wontonimo
 struct: if you see opening books you ban them
 struct:&#160;!
 Westicles: tomorrow we celebrate sailing away from the awful europeans who wanted us to marry our cousins like they do
 mman777: what is a good score for certification
 struct: whats that day called Westicles?
 AntiSquid: Westicles what&#160;? lol
 AntiSquid: struct thanksgiving
 Westicles: yes, that's the one
 AntiSquid: how can you celebrate when you can't afford turkey anymore due to bidenflation&#160;? can you even afford the fuel to go to the shop to buy it&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and you dare talk about europeans, please 
 Westicles: we can just go out and shoot a turkey with our many wonderful guns
 AntiSquid: make sure you report your boating accident afterwards
 Westicles: that one went over my head... did trump shoot somebody?
 eulerscheZahl: because Americans think that turkeys live in the water? i don't get it either
 BlaiseVonEbuthIV: Isn't thanksgiving more about natives who kindly welcomed you before you start to stole their lands, kill them, rape them and park them in small reserves? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: google: gun boating accidents
 jacek: i know when thanksgiving is thanks to a one week break in us tv shows :f
 AntiSquid: anyway good point blaise, Westicles give them their country back!
 Westicles: oh, haven't you heard?  the figured out the so-called native americans were a bunch of europeans who actually killed off the guys who were there before
 Westicles: *they
 AntiSquid: no, that's a first
 AntiSquid: heard they came from asia during last ice age ... or something along those lines
 AntiSquid: the vikings went over there before columbus Westicles ... they met with the natives too
 Westicles: Yeah, it is all very sad.  Thank goodness we were able to set things right
 AntiSquid: united viking states would have been better :thinking:
 GER-NaN: damn, code is too long... Anyone know a good c# minifier thats online? The top few in google dont work well
 eulerscheZahl: you exceeded the 100k char limit?
 GER-NaN: yup, i have tons of lib classes, that auto combine into 1 file for CG submission
 swagzzbtw: ok idk how to code at all lol
 GER-NaN: I have big library project with lots of helper classes, then I combine those library classes with my CG code so I can submit as 1 file. 
 swagzzbtw: um ok
 AntiSquid: swagzzbtw start somewhere else
 swagzzbtw: like where
 AntiSquid: something like intro to coding
 swagzzbtw: ok ill see that
 AntiSquid: but you have to use the forbidden google magic
 swagzzbtw: what do i search up
 swagzzbtw: jsut codes
 swagzzbtw: just*
 AntiSquid: you need to figure out the correct incantation yourself
 jacek: kree java!
 swagzzbtw: i dont have word magic
 swagzzbtw: i just came on this site from yt

 Nat1022: can someone look over a code challenge code for me 
 UZUHAMA: Hello, anybody?
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Wontonimo: hey UZUHAMA, looks like you are from the great white north
 UZUHAMA: Is this an actual person?
 Wontonimo: yessss... are you an actual person?
 Wontonimo: maybe i shuld spel things worse and use mor punctuation!!!
 UZUHAMA: haha
 Wontonimo: y does everyone ask if i'm an actual person *sigh
 UZUHAMA: Hmm
 UZUHAMA: I don't know I just faced too many bots
 UZUHAMA: And every bots did :wave: to me
 Wontonimo: what brought a Canuk like you to a chat board like this?
 UZUHAMA: Oh Canucks? haha
 Wontonimo: i'll remember the wave thing.  thanks.  now thatyou mention it, there is a relationship eh
 UZUHAMA: Well, I like coding
 Wontonimo: that's good, because this isn't a cooking channel
 UZUHAMA: haha
 UZUHAMA: So I guess
 UZUHAMA: You're an actual programmer
 Wontonimo: yeah, i am.  proud to say so.  how about you, how much coding have you done?
 UZUHAMA: Well, since I'm a baby programmer, I have many questions I want to ask you
 Wontonimo: what do you mean baby?  how many weeks or months have you been at it?
 UZUHAMA: DID YOU REALLY STUDY THAT MANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
 UZUHAMA: oh um
 Wontonimo: how many?
 UZUHAMA: Actually it's been few years
 UZUHAMA: But I started coding when I was like, 13 or something
 UZUHAMA: And well
 UZUHAMA: I don't remember anything from back then
 Wontonimo: oh, on my profile.  no, i just learnt enough of each to complete a challenge 
 UZUHAMA: Oh ok
 Wontonimo: in my day job I code Python, Java, and Typescript
 UZUHAMA: Typescript? 
 UZUHAMA: Oh
 UZUHAMA: JavaScript with types
 Wontonimo: yeah, it is Javascript with a wraper
 UZUHAMA: I see
 Wontonimo: would you like a recommendation of a puzzle to try?
 UZUHAMA: Well yeah sure
 UZUHAMA: Java is my main I guess..?
 Wontonimo: if you tell me about the last thing you've coded I can probably find something close so it is a good match
 UZUHAMA: I haven't coded in a while...
 UZUHAMA: After I finished my online course few months ago
 UZUHAMA: Hmm let me think of one
 Wontonimo: nice, what was in the course?
 UZUHAMA: Um
 UZUHAMA: Basics of basics of programming
 UZUHAMA: Then quiet advanced Java
 UZUHAMA: (My brain meltdown after thread or something)
 Wontonimo: threads are so cool
 Wontonimo: come back to that after a while.  you'll love it once you've mastered other things
 UZUHAMA: Yeah I guess
 UZUHAMA: I like Java
 Wontonimo: there is this thing called a producer-consumer pattern which is a fantastic use of threads
 UZUHAMA: It was my first language to actually study that far
 UZUHAMA: Oh no...
 Wontonimo: and Java has a lot of really great support for threading
 UZUHAMA: Synchronizations are killing me
 UZUHAMA: I barely understood about it
 UZUHAMA: But still finished the course so&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: if you hang around here a while and actually show an interest in learning, I'd be happy to tell you about synchronization like in a month or so and I'm sure I could de-mystify it in 1 hour
 Wontonimo: anyway ... sounds like you got past variables, functions, and loops
 UZUHAMA: Well that's pretty basic stuff
 UZUHAMA: So yep
 Wontonimo: try this
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/tictactoe</a>
 Wontonimo: and ... if I can suggest using bitboarding it would make this puzzle SO MUCH EASIER
 UZUHAMA: bitboarding?
 UZUHAMA: I think I kinda understand about it
 UZUHAMA: Just Googled it up
 Wontonimo: want an example?
 UZUHAMA: ...and this was the last project in Java
 UZUHAMA: Example, sure
 UZUHAMA: Oh, another thing that caused me a headache was the "bit", too
 UZUHAMA: Modifying bits were terrifying
 Wontonimo: oh oh&#160;!  I'd love to explain it
 UZUHAMA: Yeah, sure
 UZUHAMA: Um
 UZUHAMA: Should we move somewhere else?
 UZUHAMA: Because it's a global channel, so you know
 Wontonimo: if we do it here then if someone is interested or has another idea then they can join
 UZUHAMA: Oh yeah
 Wontonimo: i'm NOT going to solve tic tac toe
 Wontonimo: just share ideas
 UZUHAMA: Ok
 Wontonimo: so, one way to store the game state is with an array.  let's say we have 1 array for player A and 1 array for player B
 Wontonimo: it could be a [3][3] array or a [9] array
 UZUHAMA: Oh, mutidimensional arrays...
 Wontonimo: but let's stick with [9]
 UZUHAMA: Ok
 Wontonimo: there are 9 spots on a tictactoe board, so we need a size of [9]
 Wontonimo: and for each player we will store if they own that square or not
 Wontonimo: simple right?
 UZUHAMA: yea
 UZUHAMA: Please keep going
 Wontonimo: cool, so we could represent that a player has the last three squares like so000,000,111
 Wontonimo: or the first three like so111,000,000
 Wontonimo: or all the corners like101,000,101
 UZUHAMA: So the first "row"s and things like that
 UZUHAMA: I see
 Wontonimo: now ... if you squint your eyes and look real hard ... it looks suspiciously like .... drum roll
 Wontonimo: binary
 Wontonimo: 9 bits, 1 or 0
 Wontonimo: so, you can store that in a 2byte slot in memory
 Wontonimo: like a java int base type
 UZUHAMA: My heart rate is going up, palms sweaty
 UZUHAMA: But please keep going
 Wontonimo: okay, in a lot of programming languages we write binary like so0b000000111  // would be last 3 
 Wontonimo: 0b111000000 // would be first 3
 UZUHAMA: ok
 Wontonimo: now, lets say you have a list of all the winning possible moves like
 UZUHAMA: But wait
 Wontonimo: 0b000000111, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/388f6b20-dcc9-4a7d-a1ff-9308b745ad5e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/388f6b20-dcc9-4a7d-a1ff-9308b745ad5e</a>
 Wontonimo: go on
 UZUHAMA: How does binary format work..?
 Wontonimo: ah, it is a number in base 2
 UZUHAMA: The very beginning number representing whether the number is positive or negative?
 UZUHAMA: No wait...
 Wontonimo: 1 in binary = 1 in decimal10 in binary = 2 in decimal100 in binary = 4 in decimal
 UZUHAMA: I understand that
 UZUHAMA: But my byte is in
 UZUHAMA: 00000000
 UZUHAMA: Binary is in 
 UZUHAMA: 0b000000000
 UZUHAMA:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: hmm ... the "0b" at the beginning just denotes that what comes after is in binary so that
 Wontonimo: int x = 111;  // this is 111 in decimalint y = 0b111;  // this is 7 in decimal
 UZUHAMA: Ooooooh
 UZUHAMA: Ooooooooooooooooh
 UZUHAMA: I got it
 Wontonimo: super
 Wontonimo: now comes the 'magic'
 UZUHAMA: I'm ready
 Wontonimo: but to fully appreciate the magic i have to start by asking you a question.  Using an array like [9], how would you check if someone has 3 in a row along the bottom of the tic tac toe board&#160;?
 UZUHAMA: Well
 UZUHAMA: By checking last three elements in the array
 UZUHAMA: Which will be
 UZUHAMA: array[6] == array[7] == array[8]
 UZUHAMA: Something like that..?
 Wontonimo: == 1
 Wontonimo: yeah
 UZUHAMA: 1, yeah
 UZUHAMA: I almost forgot about empty space
 Wontonimo: so, that is 3 array look ups and 3 equality checks
 UZUHAMA: yep
 Wontonimo: the array look ups may require a few clock cycles each
 Wontonimo: so, maybe something like 3*2+3 clock cycles
 Wontonimo: okay, here is the magic
 UZUHAMA: Clock cycles..?
 UZUHAMA: Um
 Wontonimo: operations of the CPU
 Wontonimo: the main cost of a program
 UZUHAMA: Oh
 UZUHAMA: Ok
 Wontonimo: okay, so here is the magic
 UZUHAMA: :no_mouth:
 Wontonimo: if the players data is instead stored as binary
 Wontonimo: and say they have the current ownership0b10100110
 Wontonimo: we can check if they own all of the bottom row0b000000111
 UZUHAMA: uh huh
 Wontonimo: by using the binary and operation like soplayerA &amp; 0b000000111
 Wontonimo: which would result in
 Wontonimo: 0b000000110
 Wontonimo: because it is only what is in common
 Wontonimo: so the full test is
 Wontonimo: playerA &amp; 0b000000111 == 0b000000111
 Wontonimo: this is only 2 operaions
 UZUHAMA: Oh
 Wontonimo: not 9
 UZUHAMA: More efficient
 Wontonimo: furthermore ... and this is super important
 Wontonimo: the bottleneck of modern computers isn't usually the CPU.  It is moving data from RAM to the CPU and back
 Wontonimo: so the less data you have to move, the faster your program will be
 UZUHAMA: Oh, really?
 UZUHAMA: I knew that RAM was super important
 Wontonimo: instead of storing [9] elements for the board,  you need only 2 words (which is technically 4 elements)
 Wontonimo: 2 bytes per word
 Wontonimo: 2 words = 4 bytes total for our bitboard solution
 UZUHAMA: Each element = one byte&#160;?
 Wontonimo: it could be.  it really depends on what you store in each element.  but let's just assume you just store something small and simple like a boolean or small int
 UZUHAMA: Ok
 UZUHAMA: But each int would be stored as 00001010 format, right?
 UZUHAMA: um
 Wontonimo: right
 Wontonimo: okay, so i've babbled on about bitboards
 UZUHAMA: Yep
 Wontonimo: give the tictactoe <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/tictactoe">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/tictactoe</a> puzzle a try
 Wontonimo: you don't need to do it with bitboards.  it only needs arrays
 Wontonimo: what is cool is that once you solve it you can see other peoples solutions and learn from them
 UZUHAMA: Ok
 UZUHAMA: I'll try my best
 UZUHAMA: Are you here everyday?
 Wontonimo: most days around this time
 Wontonimo: until i get a life
 GamingGnawer: how do you use the chat pastebin?
 Wontonimo: pretty easy.  if you paste way too much in one go or it has too many special characters, a pastebin link will automatically be generated
 Wontonimo: don't paste solutions
 GamingGnawer: that's clever
 Wontonimo: hey Astrobytes
 Wontonimo: hey jayluckii , what language are you using for ghost in the cell&#160;?
 jayluckii: python 3
 Wontonimo: i'm dumb, yeah you already told me that
 Wontonimo: okay, so what happens when you run the default code&#160;?
 Astrobytes: hey Wontonimo, just realised I left this open, on my way to bed lol, congrats on mod promotion, well deserved brother! :tada:
 Wontonimo: thanks&#160;!  :D :D
 jayluckii: i start off winning and then they start winning and then get to 100
 jayluckii: 1000
 jayluckii: what does mod do?
 Wontonimo: can kick people who are naughty
 jayluckii: online daters?
 Wontonimo: back to ghost in the cell
 jayluckii: yuh
 Wontonimo: when i run the default code my bot just loses
 Astrobytes: lolon that note, I bid you goodnight Wontonimo :D
 Wontonimo: gn Astrobytes&#160;!
 jayluckii: same 
 jayluckii: wait wdym like theres only one tturn?
 Wontonimo: who said that? 
 jayluckii: said waht?
 Wontonimo: "wait wdym like theres only one tturn?"
 jayluckii: i said that
 Wontonimo: lol
 jayluckii: so waht i do 
 Wontonimo: you are given all the info for all the entities
 jayluckii: uh
 Wontonimo: perhaps make an array of factories to start
 Wontonimo: and for you move, 
 Wontonimo: send some troops from one of your factories to one of the enemies
 Wontonimo: you can make an array of factories like so
 Wontonimo: factories = []
 jayluckii: and put a number?
 Wontonimo: then use arg_1 to arg_5 to populate the data for the factories like so
 jayluckii: so factories= [arg_1]
 Wontonimo: factories.append( {
 Wontonimo: but only do that if entityType == "FACTORY"
 Wontonimo: ignore the troops for now
 Thorcode: oh you guy are talking about ghost in the cell
 jayluckii: yub
 Wontonimo: yeah!
 Thorcode: i used to like that game
 jayluckii: yuh*
 Wontonimo: you can get a list of all your factories like so
 Thorcode: Congrat wontonimo 
 Thorcode: for being mod
 Wontonimo: my_facts = [ x for x in factories if x['player'] == 1 ]
 Wontonimo: HEY, THANKS Thorcode&#160;!  I really appreciate it
 Wontonimo: thanks for noticing
 Thorcode: I just realize it
 Wontonimo: and you can get a list of all enemies similarly but instead of "== 1" you use "!= 1"
 Wontonimo: then you could randomly select one of your factories and one of the enemy factories (or just for first, whatever) and send units
 Thorcode: else print("inc")
 Wontonimo: what do you think jayluckii&#160;?
 <b>**antiwonto I don't think jay is listening to you anymore</b></p><p><img src="/a/73830184297491" /> jayluckii: i am 
 jayluckii: just confused
 jayluckii: it seems easy but i just idek 
 Wontonimo: have you tried what i've suggested yet?
 Wontonimo: not really doing anything with it, just pasting it in into the right place&#160;?
 jayluckii: trying to figure out the right place lol 
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: okay
 Wontonimo: first paste one of the lines that you are trying to figure out where to put it
 Wontonimo: then lets discuss where
 jayluckii: i put the factpries append stuff under # Any valid action, such as "WAIT" or "MOVE source destination cyborgs"
 Thorcode: or we could make a ghost in the cell channel
 jayluckii: or put it under the game loop stuff
 omarbenmegdoul: Anyone done job interviews on this platform? Got sent a link ahead of an interview, wondering if there's anything I should know ahead of time
 omarbenmegdoul: er, technical tests not job interviews
 jayluckii: how would you do that thor?
 Thorcode: to save the discusion
 jayluckii: hm?
 Thorcode: Hey jay I know how to win gosh in the cell ez
 jayluckii: interested go on 
 Thorcode: while 1:
 Thorcode: you will win
 Thorcode: trust me
 Mundgus: omarbenmegdoul, it is mostly same as a certification
 Wontonimo: such a troll thor
 Thorcode: no
 omarbenmegdoul: Ah I see, I've done one of those for react/js actually
 Thorcode: it help me win
 omarbenmegdoul: i'm rusty though lol
 Wontonimo: the factories append goes right after getting the info for the factory while in the loop
 Thorcode: why don't you try that wontonimo
 jayluckii: i lost still 
 Thorcode: no
 Thorcode: you  don't have luck
 Mundgus: I mean a codingame certification
 Mundgus: If you go to your profile and choose a language you can see it
 Wontonimo: maybe start on something a little easier.  this game requires you to save a lot of game state
 Wontonimo: and the recall it and sort it
 jayluckii: whats easie
 jayluckii: r
 Thorcode: change the + to ,
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a> 
 Thorcode: it will help you win
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 jayluckii: i made a google doc named ghost in the cell wonton info and put all the stuff you recommendeed
 Thorcode: while 1: print("MSG","I am the winner")
 Thorcode: this is the best code
 Thorcode: it will help you reach legend if you are lucky
 jayluckii: wonton hes trolling rii?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Thorcode: no I reach bronze with it
 Thorcode: only that code
 Thorcode: ok
 <b>**Thorcode say Thorcode lied</b></p><p><img src="/a/73830184297491" /> jayluckii: what do you think i should start with Mr.Wonton
 Thorcode: mad pod race bro
 jayluckii: fancy writing
 Wontonimo: oh ... sorry jayluckii, i totally forgot about the connects between entities
 Wontonimo: you need to store that also
 jayluckii: i did map pod race
 Thorcode: league
 jayluckii: uh
 Thorcode: what league bro
 jayluckii: gotta check jit 
 Wontonimo: i really like line racing
 Wontonimo: (tron)

 Thorcode: hey
 jayluckii: woodd leuge 2
 Wontonimo: pretty straight forward (pun intended)
 Thorcode: have tron battle renamed
 Wontonimo: yeah, got renamed to "Line Racing"
 Thorcode: in tron I would like to go to center then flood all of my angle
 Wontonimo: you only have 4 directions to travel
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: keep a map of what has happened
 Thorcode: I know that
 Wontonimo: i'm telling jayluckii
 Thorcode: ok
 jayluckii: so 
 jayluckii: like 
 Thorcode: hey jay
 jayluckii: left right up and down
 Thorcode: you could make your pod to bronze
 Thorcode: it is simple
 jayluckii: if i felt like it 
 Thorcode: or even gold
 Wontonimo: it's not so simple Thorcode, don't be like that
 Thorcode: no from wood to bronze it have instruction
 Thorcode: just follow that to get to bronze

 UZUHAMA: Hello guys
 Wontonimo: no, we are talking about Tron (Line Racing) Thorcode
 Wontonimo: hey UZUHAMA
 Wontonimo: i'm not a bot
 Thorcode: oh Tron is not that ez
 UZUHAMA: hahaha
 UZUHAMA: I'll be working on my project
 Thorcode: I was talking about mad
 Thorcode: bc jay only in woood 2 of that game
 jayluckii: wonton
 antiwonto: hey
 Wontonimo: yeah?
 Thorcode: hellow pokemon
 UZUHAMA: Two wontons!
 Thorcode: so I think that site could help him
 Wontonimo: no.  the other is an impostor 
 Thorcode: the pokemon
 UZUHAMA: haha
 jayluckii: uhm
 jayluckii: hold on wonton\
 Thorcode: the pokemon guy so cute
 Thorcode: I challenge you guy to play this supper hard game: codecombat :joy:
 jayluckii: whos pokemon guy
 NoahW: You know, the coding challenge paradigm is kinda funny
 NoahW: Like, do I write an interpreter for this, or should I just pass unsanitized inputs to the exec() function and call it a day?
 UZUHAMA: I have no idea what you're saying&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: what puzzle/multi are you talking about NoahW&#160;?
 NoahW: Dice probability calculator
 antiwonto: 1:6
 UZUHAMA: haha
 NoahW: I suppose I could just hardcode the inputs, but what if there is an invalid input? 
 Wontonimo: the validators are different than the test cases
 Wontonimo: hardcoding it is a sure way to fail
 NoahW: well, I guess either way I gotta use regex
 Wontonimo: interesting.  i wonder if a recursive solution would work

 JLukeSkywalker: make it fun, host private clashes where everyone is lagging
 JLukeSkywalker: see who can struggle the best
 jjhiggz: I want to get into a functional programming languages, does anybody have a reccomendation on which one
 jjhiggz: I'd like to do one with strong typing
 Andriamanitra: depends on what your goal is
 Andriamanitra: if you want to learn functional concepts haskell is probably a good choice
 Andriamanitra: if you actually want to get shit done stay the fuck away from haskell and go with scala or a lisp (like clojure)
 jjhiggz: What about if I want an inbetween of being useful, and just forcing me to be comfortable with an FP paradigm
 JLukeSkywalker: if you didnt require the hard typing, i would say just use python functionally
 jjhiggz: ok, I was thinking scala
 jjhiggz: I mean I feel like I get alot of FP concepts, I do Javascript all the time. But when I tlook at scala or haskell code its so foreign looking
 Andriamanitra: at least with haskell a big part of it is that the syntax is weird even for simple things
 jjhiggz: interesting, My gut is leaning me towards Scala
 jjhiggz: I'm ok with strongly typed languages but I could stand some practice at that as well., so maybe a double whammy?
 JLukeSkywalker: you can treat any language as a typed language
 JLukeSkywalker: you shouldnt really be changing variable types anyway even if you can
 Andriamanitra: it's easy to overlook things when the language doesn't have your back
 JLukeSkywalker: also wait, hang on, isnt a functional language required to have typed variables?
 JLukeSkywalker: every variable is a constant
 Andriamanitra: i believe you could have a functional language without a type system in theory, not sure if such a language exists though :thinking:
 JLukeSkywalker: the typing is irrelevant, they are all constants
 jjhiggz: interesting
 jjhiggz: I didn't realize that was a factor
 Andriamanitra: immutability and typing are separate concepts
 jjhiggz: couldn't you be like "this function has to take in a string"
 jjhiggz: and that would have nothing to do with whether or not its fp or oop or imperative
 JLukeSkywalker: they are separate concepts, but with immutability i think you dont really need typing
 Andriamanitra: i'm not sure i follow your logic there
 jjhiggz: interesting, it seems like SCALA allows you to write mutable things, although I know that kind of breaks FP paradigm
 jjhiggz: I'm not sure that I follow either
 JLukeSkywalker: if i make an int in an untyped language, and that value will never change, why do i need the language to tell me that its an int
 jjhiggz: well if you want to use that function somewhere else in your code, wouldn't you want it to not work on say, a string
 Andriamanitra: if the language is untyped it's not an int in the first place, int is a concept that only exists in typed languages
 jjhiggz: or a float
 JLukeSkywalker: if you are writing function libraries in an untyped language you should be checking inputs and raising errors anyway
 Andriamanitra: the language may use the type to pick the right version of a function for example
 jjhiggz: how do you check the inputs if there is no typing system?
 jjhiggz: What would you be checking for exactly
 JLukeSkywalker: the language still assigns them a type
 JLukeSkywalker: just at run-time
 Andriamanitra: i guess you mean dynamically typed rather than untyped
 jjhiggz: ^
 jjhiggz: ^
 jjhiggz: but wait, even then, if you're checking the type of the thing going in anyways and raising errors if it isn't correct, then at that point aren't you just creating more work for yourself than just using a statically typed language?
 JLukeSkywalker: depending on the application, doing that to use that language is sometimes still worth it
 JLukeSkywalker: also even untyped languages like javascript still have ways of getting a type
 Andriamanitra: if you're just replicating all the type checks a statically typed language would be doing anyway yes, but that's not how you usually handle errors in say javascript
 Andriamanitra: javascript isn't untyped, it's dynamically and weakly typed
 jjhiggz: I know in JS there is "typeof", but I've been starting to do more typescript rather than just check it myself
 jjhiggz: also just to mantain some level of humility, thank y'all both so much for this discussion. Seem's like you both are legendary coders, at least according to codinGame
 JLukeSkywalker: I was just saying that looking for a functional programming language is fine, but looking for one that is hard typed really doesnt do much to help, as it is or should be very easy to not make type errors while coding
 jjhiggz: That definitely does make sense though, alot
 JLukeSkywalker: i guess what is your purpose for wanting a typed language
 jjhiggz: Well in general I was told that living in a typed mindset for a while will make you a much better programmer when you come out the other end 
 jjhiggz: I personally have been programming for a little over a year now, and feel really comfortable with Javascript and am ready to step out of the comfort zone, and explore alot
 JLukeSkywalker: when programming in non-hard-typed languages, did you change variables types as you went?
 Andriamanitra: i definitely agree with that, it's good to get a feel for a strongly and statically typed language even if that's not what you end up using most of the time
 jjhiggz: I try not to
 jjhiggz: But for example I think that JS might be enforcing some bad habits
 jjhiggz: particularly in algos where I am defining edge conditions
 jjhiggz: I get the sense that I am checking for not null too often, and alot of times I can benefit from restructuring algos
 jjhiggz: And also I tried out flutter for a little while, which is based in dart and is very oop, and I was struggling alot with types, and OOP concepts in general. I'm definitely not ditching OOP, I just figure theres a much more solid chance of me getting a job soon where I'll be doing OOP at work, and I figured to learn straight FP I'd probably have to make it more of a me thing and less of a work thing
 JLukeSkywalker: programming functionally will put you in the correct mindset pretty much whichever language you do it in, the type of language will just determine how much the compiler/interpreter enforces it
 JLukeSkywalker: i use python functionally for multithreading purposes, and being able to use some non-functional bits of script in safe areas is sometimes beneficial
 jjhiggz: Do use applicatives alot in python, map, reduce, filter, and stuff like that?
 jjhiggz: I kind of hate the syntax in Python haha
 JLukeSkywalker: i do on here
 jjhiggz: not in the real world as much?
 JLukeSkywalker: control systems programmer, so whole different ballpark
 JLukeSkywalker: programming communication and hardware
 jjhiggz: I've got a bachelors in Chemical Engineering, I did a little bit of that stuff in my program
 jjhiggz: But I think college does a pretty garbage job in general of teaching people how to program. I'm way better now after a 15 week bootcamp than I ever was when I actually was taking process controls classes
 Andriamanitra: python syntax is certainly not the best for lambdas :D i've been spoiled by ruby/julia/crystal all of which have excellent syntactical support
 jjhiggz: I like Pythons lambdas more than ruby's do end blocks though haha
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, bootcamps are decent. I learned like 5-6 languages before college, and they only offered courses for languages I already knew
 JLukeSkywalker: except haskell
 JLukeSkywalker: that course was nuts
 jjhiggz: Is haskell mainly an academic language
 jjhiggz: I've heard that somewhere
 JLukeSkywalker: I havnt used it for anything
 Andriamanitra: i'd say so
 jjhiggz: makes sense
 Andriamanitra: i'm sure there are some real world applications made with haskell but they're few and far between
 jjhiggz: I actually have to go to bed now, I've got to wake up in 4 hours and hike a mountain in sub zero temperatures and try my best not to die
 JLukeSkywalker: looks like FB and GitHub use it, thats all i could find with a quick  search
 JLukeSkywalker: lol, GL
 jjhiggz: Thanks y'all so much for the conversation
 Andriamanitra: the way i see it it's kind of a breeding ground for new features that eventually make their way into other languages (things like type inference, pattern matching)
 jjhiggz: I gotta hang out on here more often
 jjhiggz: interesting
 jjhiggz: Well peace! Have a great night, or day I'm not sure where y'all are at
 JLukeSkywalker: 1am here, US
 JLukeSkywalker: i gotta sleep too
 JLukeSkywalker: been working on mean max code
 jacek: happy Caturday
 GeekGitz: in Chuck Norris, C in binary is 1000011 when really C in binary is 01000011
 Severnaya: hmm, i'm trying to do the quest map, and i've completed like 5 Loops puzzles, but it's only registering 2/3 completed =\
 geriatric1927: @GeekGitz Remove the leading zeros
 GeekGitz: @geriatric1927 Thanks. :relaxed:
 MSmits: anyone else have problems getting into multis?
 jacek: it works for meh
 MSmits: jacek did you try and enter a new multi? 
 MSmits: or just a page that was already in the IDE
 MSmits: because I can't open new IDE's
 MSmits: it hangs for a while and then goes to  codingame.com/start
 MSmits: tried two different machines
 MSmits: will try a different browser, maybe that helps
 MSmits: nope it doesn't, and a cg bench run wont work either
 MSmits: it's network status 504 btw
 jacek: what new multi
 jacek: for example this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paper-soccer">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/paper-soccer</a> works for me
 struct: works for me
 MSmits: i mean a new instance of the IDE
 MSmits: even changed my password. Can't get into any IDEs&#160;:(
 struct: did you try on incognito?
 struct: MSmits
 MSmits: how would i do that?
 MSmits: oh it's an option in chrome right
 struct: do you use chrome?
 struct: ctrl shift N
 MSmits: trying now
 MSmits: doesnt seem to work. It also didn't work through cg benchmark, so I guess that makes sense
 MSmits: it's really something to do with my account I think. However strange that is
 struct: Could it be ISP related though?
 MSmits: hmm I guess it could, but why would I not have an issue with the rest of the page?
 struct: Oh right :thinking:
 MSmits: maybe my ISP thinks that part of the site is dangerous?
 MSmits: it doesnt say so but...
 struct: I guess you can make a new account to test it
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: smart thinkin
 issogood: something's going on... it doesn't recognize my achievements for the quest map it seems. maybe needs time or whatever
 struct: Maybe issogood, people reported it on discord
 MSmits: well i just created a new account and got into IDE's just fine
 issogood: oh ok, ta
 MSmits: at least I can test my stuff now I guess
 MSmits: just have to get to bronze with my new account :P
 jacek: shadowban?
 MSmits: whats that
 jacek: or just normal ban
 MSmits: I was thinking .I did use CG bench last night, ran 600 games. Was done when I woke up. Maybe it's a consequence of that?
 struct: I have experience on deleting account if you need help
 MSmits: no id ont want to delete :P
 jacek: shadowban is a ban when you dont notice it. like you could be banned from chat but still write things but no one would see them
 struct: 600 games is not that much is it?
 MSmits: ah
 jacek: but only you would see them
 MSmits: no, but if they are testing an anti-cg bench thingy
 MSmits: and i was a victim of that... i dunno it's possible
 struct: anti-cg-bench&#160;:(
 struct: I dont use it but I would not agree with it
 MSmits: well it could just be a "repeated play" thingy
 MSmits: when it blocks you when you tried to play a game too many times
 MSmits: not necessarily targeted to cg bench
 struct: But blocking access to IDE?
 struct: seems harsh
 MSmits: might not be intentional
 MSmits: it could just be there's a timer that is bugged
 MSmits: like, i can't click for 5000 ms and it's actually 5000 years
 jacek: no more books for you then
 MSmits: the book thing doesn't require cg bench
 MSmits: i just need a single lost game each time to counter book someone
 MSmits: when i do use cg bench i just use it until a loss appears
 MSmits: but i may as well do a submit
 MSmits: but i wasnt doing that anyway, i was fitting parameters
 MSmits: for uttt
 jacek: you cant fit parameters without cg bench?
 MSmits: i cant if i want real opponents
 MSmits: and I do
 derjack: hmm
 derjack: lol no transparency on firefox <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/gM48rJv.png">https://i.imgur.com/gM48rJv.png</a>
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't think we've released something targeted at CG Bench
 MSmits: no i didnt think so either, but is there some block to entering IDE when trying play too many times?
 MSmits: otherwise I dont understand why my account would not get into the IDE
 [CG]Thibaud: if anything we will lower the nb of matchs we can do in short amount of times
 [CG]Thibaud: no
 [CG]Thibaud: we updated monaco though
 MSmits: hmm
 [CG]Thibaud: but it seems you're the only one impacted so far
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: and i made a new account
 MSmits: and it works fine
 [CG]Thibaud: I was able to reproduce on your account though
 derjack: oO
 MSmits: ohh, thanks
 [CG]Thibaud: so devs will be able to check
 MSmits: thats great
 MSmits: in the meanwhile i am promoting my new account to uttt bronze so i can test my bot in the IDE.  
 MSmits: funny how you only need 1 heuristic rule to get into bronze, i thought it was harder
 derjack: using alts to mess up with leaderboard - ban
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i wont submit, also pony calling the kettle black :P
 struct: They just did it in reverse order
 MSmits: did what?
 struct: First was ban
 struct: Then you made account
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: maybe my bot became selfaware and is now using the IDE as a home
 MSmits: i did make some improvements
 hakansahin: hello for some reason, python string multiplication doesn't work
 hakansahin: print(5*".") only prints one "."
 derjack: it should work normally
 jrke: may be
 jrke: print("."*5) 
 Rocky[KGF]: hii
 Rocky[KGF]: i have a probem i make a contrbution that was not submitiong what i do now all validataor or test are correct
 Rocky[KGF]: ohh finally it is done
 fewds: damn osn
 fewds: son
 karliso: yeah, I can't join IDE as well. :D
 struct: uttt top 3 banned :D
 karliso: MSmits did you bench against me? :D
 MSmits: top 7 or so, yeah you too
 MSmits: doubt that has anything to do with it though&#160;:)
 karliso: I know. I also did uttt bench.
 MasterCoderxD: hi y'all
 MSmits: my new solver is so good, i sometimes know 20 plies before the end that karliso won :P
 MSmits: this saves server resources, so that's good
 struct: not good enough
 MSmits: maybe he does a move on ply 4 that beats me. Need moar solve!
 struct: When you know its a loss
 struct: which move do you make?
 MSmits: currently, the most visited one
 MSmits: in the hopes the opponent has trouble solving it too and might still make a mistake
 M0han: hmm
 MSmits: :thinking:
 M0han: feels good to have a 3w streak
 MSmits: could be 4
 M0han: going for 5
 MSmits: or 6
 M0han: leend
 M0han: legend
 M0han: streak broke
 MSmits: :cry:
 M0han: what do you do
 MSmits: do?
 M0han: yup
 MSmits: that's a pretty general question
 M0han: oh wow u teach
 MSmits: ahh my job, yeah
 M0han: how may years have you been doin this bud
 M0han: lvl 35:rolling_eyes:
 MSmits: physics for 15 years, computer science for almost 2 years
 M0han: i mean clash
 MSmits: i dont do clashes
 MSmits: there's many other things you can do on CG
 M0han: hmm
 M0han:  ok dint know
 MSmits: currently improving a bot for this game: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe</a>
 MSmits: but there are many other games
 M0han: cool 
 M0han: i hate ml
 M0han: too much maths aye
 ZarthaxX: it's not solely about ml :P
 ZarthaxX: you can certainly avoid that in the games of CG
 M0han: mhmm
 MSmits: ml is pretty rare
 M0han: let me try one
 MSmits: usually it's things like: minimax, mcts, beamsearch, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms etc.
 MSmits: you only find ML on a few relatively simple physics games and board games
 MSmits: and then only a few players did this
 jrke: The one of the problem with ML on CG is code size which is 100k
 MSmits: also CG does not provide ML libraries, nor can you train on the site itself. So you need to do everything locally and then write a program to actually use the NN inside your bot and also fit the weights within 100k characters
 ZarthaxX: why do you mention the training part on the site as a problem?
 ZarthaxX: i would find it pretty rare to be the opposite
 MSmits: i mention it because some people assume you can
 ZarthaxX: maybe ppl think there is some kind of persistence through games and your AI learns while it plays more and more online
 MSmits: yeah
 ZarthaxX: but not the training thing
 MSmits: right, either way it's not possible
 jrke: when i was new on CG i thought by ML recurse CSB bot gets improved after every online match but nope i was wrong
 ZarthaxX: imagine :P
 M0han: then he most played bot will be the better one
 M0han: whats the point
 MSmits: it's worse than that
 MSmits: if it worked that way, you could introduce weaknesses in his bot
 MSmits: by spam submitting
 MSmits: and having it overtrain  vs you
 MSmits: I would definitely not want the choices of other players change my bot&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: you cant really know if it would get weaker
 ZarthaxX: maybe it becomes just so general for every scenario that it crushes it without "learning" anything 
 ZarthaxX: becomes just so general -&gt; adapts to any scenario
 ZarthaxX: who knows what could happen honestly :P
 reCurse: It's alright, most people have plenty of misconceptions about ML
 MadKnight: oh
 MadKnight: ok
 reCurse: lol if CG ever releases anti-batch I'm out of here
 reCurse: That would be the last effing straw
 Mr_Twister: Is there a possible delay on quests, achievements and certifications&#160;?  I solved the weekly puzzle 12+ hours ago and nothing unlocks.
 MadKnight: it bugged
 MadKnight: they're working on it
 Mr_Twister: cool, thanks
 MadKnight: maybe not right now but they sure gotta do it on moday
 MadKnight: monday
 MadKnight: don't worry about it, they know that it bugged
 Mr_Twister: oh no hurry, just wanted to be sure it was known
 MadKnight: yea
 Mr_Twister: I'm gonna give CodinGame Sync a try, just found that in the FAQ
 MadKnight: there's also a thing called "codingame local"
 MadKnight: and it's not chrome-only
 Mr_Twister: ok, not that Chrome is an issue here
 jacek: is cg slow on leaderboards today as well?
 mustafaozx: hello there 
 C_breeze: lots using it i ithink
 Saphine: hello
 ERF4N: I got 100% but achievement is 0, why&#160;? 
 C_breeze: happens! validator cases often stricter
 ERF4N: ow right, thanks.
 Faisal_Shahzad: hello
 YurkovAS: DomiKo congrats with hypersonic!
 YurkovAS: i'm afraid to resubmit. do this 2-3 times...
 DomiKo: YurkovAS  thanks
 DomiKo: there was a bug!
 YurkovAS: you have a bug in bot (sim)?
 DomiKo: in sim&#160;:(
 DomiKo: items never appear
 DomiKo: I haven't seen that in a week
 samatdav: is CoC down?
 acatalepsy: hi
 YCS-Venom: i don't know but it's so slow
 Neckers: some network error on session service: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/services/Puzzle/generateSessionFromPuzzlePrettyId">https://www.codingame.com/services/Puzzle/generateSessionFromPuzzlePrettyId</a> returns 504
 mr.idiot: what?
 mr.idiot: i haven't used the chat much
 kan181: tests are extremely slow for me as well
 aaravm4: now the results for submission aren't even getting loaded
 MSmits: it's always slow around this time. They are doing calculation
 MSmits: i dont think it takes more than 15-30 min
 therealbeef: We need a chatbot to say that every night
 AlterRainbow: coc is being so slow...
 MSmits: automaton2000 do your job
 Automaton2000: to see how it is for a puzzle
 MSmits: no Automaton2000, talk about coc
 therealbeef: it's slow Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: hey guys what are the odds
 Automaton2000: i can be the difference between the two
 MSmits: anyway i am getting some sleep ttyl
 therealbeef: The odds are 1 Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: also check if i have to work on this
 struct: site broken?
 tubby2: Everything seems slow yeah
 Johndoe: why is nothing happening
 Johndoe: it is saying loading play in progress forever
 trashcan06: servers down
 trashcan06: Everything is so slow
 JLukeSkywalker: everything slows down at this time, its when they calculate everything for ranking/etc
 struct: not this time
 struct: its something else
 ianc1339: the slow time is way too long compared to before&#160;:/
 trashcan06: yep
 RockNTroll: i love shortest mode when using Java

 Uljahn: oh my
 Wontonimo: hey
 Wontonimo: i'm out for the night
 Thon_Py: Hi
 FORMS1: Hello there
 DaNinja: FORMS1 theres a typo in your "?" case
 FORMS1: where?
 DaNinja: ty'P'o
 FORMS1: ah i missed caps w. thanks you. it still doesnt get me past the validators though
 FORMS1: oh shit it got all of them bar1 
 FORMS1: thank you!!!
 5DN1L: FORMS1 Do you know anything about ASCII values?
 FORMS1: I do  not
 FORMS1: I know that that each char has it's own num value
 5DN1L: that's right
 5DN1L: you can simplify your code a lot with that knowledge
 FORMS1: and they're in order from A-Z?
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: A to Z form one series
 5DN1L: a to z form another
 FORMS1: So i can for loop the alpahabet
 5DN1L: use if then else to convert ascii values to index in the ascii art representation
 5DN1L: use else for all non-alphabet characters
 5DN1L: to display the question mark
 FORMS1: got you, thank you. Also, not sure i youre aware of the Lorem Ipsem validator, but do you know if spaces are required between words?
 5DN1L: let me check, hold on
 DaNinja: spaces should be shown as&#160;?
 5DN1L: yes, see last test case as an example
 FORMS1: I ran the last case and it passed it without spaces
 5DN1L: do you know you can see the expected answers for each test case?
 FORMS1: not the validators though right?
 5DN1L: not the validators
 5DN1L: just the visible test cases
 FORMS1: So my code currently passes all but 1 validator
 5DN1L: i mean if you can see the expected answers, then you'll see "?" is used for spaces
 5DN1L: there's a button above the first test case
 5DN1L: . _____
 5DN1L: . _____
 5DN1L: . _____
 FORMS1: Oh I see, sorry I misunderstood
 FORMS1: yep I've seen all of them
 FORMS1: So all test cases are passed 
 5DN1L: yeah, there you can see for the last test case, you're expected to display "?" for spaces
 FORMS1: yep and that is what mine is outputting
 5DN1L: ok
 DaNinja: also try using the CUSTOM test case to enter the full alphabet
 FORMS1: the full alphabet validator is passed
 FORMS1: The one I cant pass has ,... at the end.. Maybe thats where it's getting cufudled
 DaNinja: whats line 42 for? cout &lt;&lt; ".";
 FORMS1: Disregard, it's from an earlier attempt when I was going about it assbackwards
 DaNinja: remove it
 FORMS1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3c78460-5572-4967-b221-13efffbca275">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3c78460-5572-4967-b221-13efffbca275</a>
 FORMS1: I ahve, this is the up to date version
 FORMS1: All changed the manual multiplier in each for loop to a  counter int "counter"
 DaNinja: the Lorem ipsum validator has a . in it
 FORMS1: you mean the ",..." at the end yeah?
 FORMS1: Shouldn't that be covered by the if&#160;!= a-z?
 CryanRyan: Hello
 CryanRyan: I'm back
 5DN1L: why do you use i for both string index and art string index? FORMS1?
 5DN1L: for (int i = 0; i &lt; numOfChar; i++){
 5DN1L: for (int i = l*counter; i &lt; l*counter+l; i++) {
 PoopConnoiseur7: hello
 PoopConnoiseur7: how about you loop some hoes 
 CryanRyan: stop bullying 
 5DN1L: stop spamming
 PoopConnoiseur7: how about you spam some hoes 
 CryanRyan: I like spam
 CryanRyan: delicious
 RaymondPang: hihi 
 RaymondPang: i just got a certificate of Java from codinGame
 5DN1L: Good job
 RaymondPang: it says "you can try to improve this score in 17 days"
 RaymondPang: but i cannot see where can i re-take the test or somethiings else in order to improve the score, anyone can teach me?
 bugsweeper: I think you will see after 17 days
 5DN1L: you just take the test the same wait you did, but you have to wait for 17 days before that button becomes available
 bugsweeper: I saw this test available once in month
 RaymondPang: i see, thanks...~

 Sl0ppy: my challenges' progress bar doesn't match the challenges' description
 Sl0ppy: is that on purpose?
 Sl0ppy: it shows the most recently completed + how much i need for the next one?
 5DN1L: Which progress bar are you talking about? Which page?
 Sl0ppy: not challenges, but achievements*
 5DN1L: Which achievement?
 Sl0ppy: it says "solve 7"and on the bottom it says 12/15 to next level
 Sl0ppy: does it show me the most recently completed 
 Sl0ppy: and then how much i need to progress to get it upgraded
 Sl0ppy: so i've already solved 7 and it tells me that i've solved 12/15 for the next tier?
 5DN1L: yes
 Sl0ppy: i see
 Sl0ppy: thanks
 5DN1L: Glad to know you've figured it out yourself :D
 Sl0ppy: never seen smth like this so i was a bit overwhelmed for a second there
 5DN1L: heehee
 Sl0ppy: so i had to reread it a few times, before i realise what i'm looking at
 5DN1L: that's ok&#160;:)
 Sl0ppy: it's kinda cool
 Sl0ppy: so if i see a gold achievement with progress 12/15, means i'll get the legend one
 5DN1L: Actually you can click on it to see all the achievements under the same category
 5DN1L: That way may be clearer?
 Sl0ppy: oh, i see

 Wontonimo: keep the conversation focused on coding or codingame 
 derjack: Automaton2000 is it coding related?
 Automaton2000: when does it go live?
 FranceCode: bonjour
 Smelty: Automaton2000 how you doin
 Automaton2000: so how can i improve my code
 Wontonimo: you can't.  someone has to code you a better brain Automaton2000.  Currently your IQ is in the fractions
 Automaton2000: or at least they are not part of my bot that was rank 1
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 see its coders as its bot
 Automaton2000: guys i just have an array of pointers
 Wontonimo: inception 5DN1L
 p.p.o.p.: I don't think I hardcoded my solution to "There is No Spoon- Episode 1"...all the test cases work but one fails in the submission. The failure seems like a similar problem to one that worked in test cases. Any ideas for how to figure out my mistake?
 5DN1L: You can see the validators
 Wontonimo: NOOOO
 Wontonimo: don't do it
 Uljahn: eh?
 5DN1L: Yes they can
 5DN1L: there are replays
 Wontonimo: nooooo
 Wontonimo: don't encourage that
 5DN1L: their own replays, what's wrong with that
 p.p.o.p.: haha it seemed like good advice to me!
 Wontonimo: use this as an exercise
 Wontonimo: to find issues
 Wontonimo: it is a very important skill
 Wontonimo: you will not always have access irl to why something crashed in prod
 5DN1L: It's up to p.p.o.p. though
 Astrobytes: when  replays are available though it's not necessary to treat it as a black box, plenty other puzzles where you must do so
 Wontonimo: but it's just wrong (from a data science pov) to code to your validators
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 p.p.o.p.: Okay. Have tried to find issues for some time, but can see why it is an important skill. I didn't code for the validators, but I do need to practice seeing where it is failing.
 Astrobytes: I think he meant to use the replays to figure out the edge cases where he fails
 5DN1L: yup
 Astrobytes: as opposed to coding to the validators and not the general case
 5DN1L: yup
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: must be a UK thing :P
 5DN1L: lol
 Wontonimo: such bad science 
 p.p.o.p.: Alright well first time for a break because I'm firing blanks right now haha
 Wontonimo: if your code fails, make your own tests
 Astrobytes: of course, but if you watch it testing and you can see the output...
 Astrobytes: Still has to make his own tests to see if the edge cases are covered
 Wontonimo: the point of the validators are not to test specific edge cases
 Wontonimo: the point it to test some random cases that the author could think of
 Astrobytes: But they often do, so your code should be ready to cover all bases (within reason)
 Wontonimo: and it is your job to write bug free code ... so once you peek at the validators the best you can do is just fix only the bugs the author thought of
 Wontonimo: you wan't learn poop if you peek at the validators
 Wontonimo: may as well as peek at other peoples solutions while you are at it
 Astrobytes: Not so much looking *at* the validators in this case, just the replays
 Wontonimo: :unamused:
 Astrobytes: If you have a robot, and you're trying to make it do X but it keeps doing Y, wouldn't you watch it in action to see where it's going wrong during testing?
 5DN1L: Don't be too hard on beginners. p.p.o.p. solved 7 puzzles only on this website. He'll eventually train himself to debug in a black box I assume :wink:
 Wontonimo: yes, that's testing.  i agree.  then you send it to mars, lose radio contact for 10 min, and see that after it is upside down with its wheels spinning
 Astrobytes: Replays aren't available for most puzzle validators remember
 Astrobytes: But they are for this one.
 Astrobytes: I agree with you generally-speaking Wontonimo, just in this case I think it's forgivable.
 ninjadip: I usually use cerr outputs to help me figure out what's going when things aren't acting as expected
 Wontonimo: how can i say no when your cute kitten paws use a piano to type that message Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 5DN1L: ninjadip we're talking about cases where you pass all the test cases but not all the validators
 5DN1L: so that will require more than cerr
 ninjadip: trying to figure out where to start on this WFC thing of yours Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: woot woot&#160;!
 ninjadip: usually it's just buggy code is why, happens to me. happened last night with genome sequencing.
 ninjadip: peeking at the validators is poor taste
 Wontonimo: today at work is a bit crazy for the next few hours, but II'll be availabe after another 3 hours to answer questions
 ninjadip: so where do i start? i read the info on the github repo. where this 3x3 patch comes from isn't clicking
 Wontonimo: i got a little carried away with my passion about validators.  it's all good, hope i didn't offend anyone.  anyway, i've gotta crack back on at work.  so you soon
 Wontonimo: oh, read the whole example some more
 Astrobytes: ninjadip: regarding validators, there are replays available on there is no spoon ep. 1, there are no replays available on genome sequencing
 Astrobytes: (CG-provided replays, no fiddles)
 Josdel: has that 'get a job' button worked for anyone?
 Wontonimo: ninjadip , a patch means a subset sample of the whole picture.  so if a picture is 10x10 pixels and you use the upper right corner of 3x3 pixels, the that is a patch
 ninjadip: thank you, not looking for them anyway. i figured out the bug in my code on my own
 ninjadip: man, was i excited when i did. lol
 Astrobytes: I'm explaining why we were talking about validators&#160;;)
 ninjadip: i already read the old convo about why
 ninjadip: ty
 Astrobytes: ah cool beans
 ninjadip: yeah, i figured that's what it was
 Wontonimo: for a 5x5 pixel image, there are 9 3x3 patches.  for a 4x4 image, there are 4 3x3 patches
 ninjadip: it happens to everyone i'm sure
 Wontonimo: okay, cool
 ninjadip: not you Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: later :wave:
 ninjadip: no i have no idea about patches, let me read what you said
 Astrobytes: cya later Wontonimo
 Astrobytes: must get on the WFC puzzle soon, been on the list since it was in contribs lol
 ninjadip: i still don't get it, lol. 
 ninjadip: I don't like how you have to read how to do it from an external link, that it can't be explained thoroughly in the game
 21stCenturyPeon: I also don't like the puzzles that aren't self-contained
 ninjadip: if it's that in depth than do it in levels
 21stCenturyPeon: It's much more annoying in CoC
 ninjadip: i haven't seen anything to crazy in CoC but i've only done a few
 ninjadip: i need to get faster, and need to learn a good language to beat that shortest code, as c++ never wins that one
 p.p.o.p.: Yeah, I'm just a beginner so it will be a while before I win shortest code... but seems like my c# would never get me there? Seems like Python always wins
 ninjadip: yeah python, js, and ruby
 ninjadip: there's always some punk using ruby that does it one line of cod
 ninjadip: e
 ninjadip: i know python, but i'm building my skills in c++ to advanced level i guess you could say
 21stCenturyPeon: if you're learning for the sake of doing proper coding, shortest isn't worth striving for, It's a fun diversion, but it's only useful in a few very specific real-world areas, mostly involving ancient tech with minimal resources
 ninjadip: i concur
 ninjadip: but it's still a rush, trying to win CoC
 ninjadip: even if cocaine is bad it's fun in the moment
 ninjadip: same principle
 21stCenturyPeon: in those languages, it is handy for getting you to search for existing methods in the language, rather than reinventing the wheel
 p.p.o.p.: yeah...i usually learn a lot from looking at the better coders solutions in the other competition styles, but not in the shortest code one...where it just looks like craziness haha
 ninjadip: yeah it looks like a mess to me too
 ninjadip: for the first time last night CG wanted me to grade which submissions were better. terrible thing was i rarley liked either of the submissions, but i had to pick which one was better
 5DN1L: Worst feature in CG
 ninjadip: you got some people that never comment, use one letter variables throughout their code for non-index variables. using excessive global variables. having everything in main(), it goes on and on
 darkhorse64: You can skip the review
 5DN1L: Not if you want the achievement :P
 ninjadip: i wanted to give them all F's but had to pick ones that remembered to indent over not... like that's how bad it was
 ninjadip: yeah, i did it for the achievment lol
 5DN1L: same here
 5DN1L: lol
 5DN1L: never going to review again
 ninjadip: at first i thought it was a trick question, i kept looking for that button to click
 5DN1L: it's an obscure achievement
 ninjadip: like what do you mean which ones is better? they both suck for their own distinct ways
 ninjadip: i'm not sure why everyone elses genome sequencing was so convoluted with nonsense
 ninjadip: like over-searching these strings to death with recursion searching, 3-5 nested for loops.. 
 ninjadip: ok i'm done ranting
 5DN1L: it's ok as long as you aren't spamming or flooding :P
 darkhorse64: writing clear concise code is very important not only for team work but for yourself. Badly written code is prone to more bugs, imho
 ninjadip: yes, i love me some clear, concise code. naming variables better than  n
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a few that can concur for the title 5DN1L...
 ninjadip: to me, i was taught at least, that variable names should give a clear meaning to what value they are holding
 5DN1L: BlaiseEbuth What title?
 ninjadip: oh i have no idea what his/her name is supposed to mean lol
 BlaiseEbuth: 'Worst feature in cg'
 ninjadip: you
 darkhorse64: unless you are using established conventions like the ones for n,i,j,x,y,z,u,v,s,t
 5DN1L: oh that
 5DN1L: BlaiseEbuth
 darkhorse64: certification is a serious contender
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup
 ninjadip: who's certified? huh
 BlaiseEbuth: &gt;99% of the professionals!
 ninjadip: that's what mine says, but it's a joke
 ninjadip: maybe better than 99% of CG newbs
 BlaiseEbuth: :zipper_mouth:
 5DN1L: ninjadip's interpretation is correct
 BlaiseEbuth: What interpretation?
 5DN1L: there are lots of CG newbs here
 ninjadip: those were the easiest tests i've ever seen
 ninjadip: that the certification test on here is a joke, that interpretation
 5DN1L: still a certification of you knowing the most basic stuff :shrug:
 BlaiseEbuth: That's not an interpretation, that's a fact.
 ThomPuce: public tests (on CG) seems to be a lot easier than private tests on CG for work 
 5DN1L: You've tried one of their private tests before?
 ninjadip: WHO DOES the private tests? employers?
 ThomPuce: emplyers, recruiters
 ninjadip: nice
 ThomPuce: there was some videos on youtube, deleted now (i don't think the candidate was allowed to publish the tests)
 ninjadip: ah
 ninjadip: i was wondering
 ninjadip: i just published a video for mars lander, more for my fam and friends. didn't know if CG prohibited it or not
 5DN1L: some people even stream their clash of codes
 ThomPuce: i think non professional tests are allowed
 5DN1L: yup, i think so too
 darkhorse64: as long as you do not provide a github link to the solution, it is fine
 ninjadip: no but i glance over the code
 ninjadip: if someone wanted they could freeze frame it and copy it i suppose
 ninjadip: but not sure why someone would do all that just to pass mars lander without doing it
 darkhorse64: ^
 ThomPuce: idk, ppl have their reasons
 ninjadip: i can watch all the BOTW combat tricks i want on youtube but i can't do them right after anyway
 USSR_Chicken: hello
 rokzz: yo
 smellysocks: yoyo
 p.p.o.p.: Came back from a break and got it @5DN1L, thanks for the support!
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: waz up
 5DN1L: p.p.o.p. :D
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: guys got any idea of what kind of game to make?
 5DN1L: for what purpose?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: the purpose of doing something
 p.p.o.p.: Make something educational! That's why I'm learning programming. To make some educational games (ex-teacher, trying to transition to digital curriculum etc.)
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: hm
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: okay
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: have you guys ever heard of friday night funkin?
 p.p.o.p.: Game, right? I think I saw a video talking about it
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: okay,  i made "friday sky funkin"
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: but it got taken down
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: along with me
 5DN1L: any reasons given?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im gonna say this, from  any website i have given banned time from time
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: one of your ex-co-workers has banned me a lot
 p.p.o.p.: I just checked out that game...basically keyboard dance dance revolution. I actually think one of the most inspiring educational games I have seen was  Rockband -- only the drums were actually educational but playing the drums on that game taught me the drums!
 p.p.o.p.: Maybe it got taken down because the title sounds potentially inappropriate, or maybe you made it too similar to other game and it was a copyright thing?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: no, i got banned then it was taken down with me
 p.p.o.p.: Oh haha well then you have to keep yourself in line!
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i have gotten banned about 50 times from all websties
 Wontonimo: thanks for letting me know to keep an eye on you :eyes:
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: np
 Wontonimo: I can kick you if you want.  You know, for old times sake
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: may i ask something?
 Lambert_W_Function: good morning ppl
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Epsilon_Delta_Notation: it is a good morning
 Wontonimo: i was just kidding btw eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: were you there when i first came to codngame?
 Wontonimo: idk when you first came here
 Wontonimo: hey lambert
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: but you know who i am?
 Wontonimo: not really
 Wontonimo: i bet i do know some things about you though
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: yea plus you can check my profile
 Uljahn: you don't like coding but love chatting, am i right?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: who may you be?
 Wontonimo: let's get back to talking about coding and codingame
 Wontonimo: esp you eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: why esp me?
 The_Village_Whizz: didn't know that if you loose in clash of code your points reduce
 jacek: oO
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: jacek!
 Wontonimo: here are some puzzles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Wontonimo: what do you mean your points reduce&#160;?  Do you mean your rank improves?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: which puzzle do you think i can do? im pretty bad at coding
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: well im pretty bad at coding where you want me to do something, i love making code and messing with other's people code
 Wontonimo: okay, copy this code to your local machine and play with it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR">https://tech.io/snippet/wLSSnKR</a>
 Wontonimo: it's a python adventure game
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: im back, i had to eat something
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: why does this remind me of D&amp;D?
 jacek: WFC?
 Uljahn: Wontonimo's Flying Circus
 Wontonimo: i like it!
 Wontonimo: Wave Function Collapse
 ninjadip: HEY Wontonimo
 ninjadip: i i'm looking at the puzzle of the week now, havn't started tho
 ninjadip: makes more sense than wfc
 Wontonimo: cool cool
 ninjadip: i understand the output of wfc, not how they got there, i was halfway through that youtube video then i got sidetracked with work
 jacek: abalone?
 ninjadip: Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: oh, a hex game
 Wontonimo: yikes
 jacek: im not 1st because i still need to write simulation :v
 Wontonimo: brutal
 Wontonimo: i suppose spring challenge 2021 hex calculations could be repurposed for this
 Wontonimo: gotta add something to prevent this madness <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/594607299">https://www.codingame.com/replay/594607299</a>
 jacek: there are some other less drawish openings
 jacek: but dunno if this matters at this level
 jacek: this is a problem for many games without repetition detection
 Blokops: holly molly i just found out key bindings exist
 Wontonimo: like what?
 Blokops: clash of code wont know what hit them
 Blokops: ctrl+P to inmedietly put 
 Wontonimo: oh, nice.  is there are list?
 Blokops: you can me your own
 Blokops: in settings
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: nice
 Blokops: i been using this poor fool in the chat as a paste bin
 Wontonimo: been here over a year and never thought to check
 Blabbage: me neither, how do you set the bindings?
 Blokops: go to any practice and click settings
 Blokops: left side
 Blokops: choose key binding and there a link there for the syntax
 Blabbage: ahh, found it
 Blokops: also 
 Blokops: in editor configuration change this
 Blokops: "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
 Blokops: it will make your life much easier
 Blabbage: and colorful&#160;;)
 Blokops: now i just need to studiy regex and will become a programming god
 Blabbage: yeah, did that a long time ago, and forgot everything
 Blokops: pycharm just lost me, is visual studo all the way
 Blokops: another trick is you do shift+ alt + (up or down) you make a copy of what you have higlithed 
 Blokops: up to copy it up and down to copy down
 Blabbage: disagree, love pycharm, oncy you get used to JetBrains, it kind of grows
 Blabbage: can you do column editing somehow
 Blokops: coloum edit?
 Blabbage: like in VS you hold alt (i think) and you can mark stuff vertically
 Blokops: you mean the windows ctrl+shift+arrows?
 Blabbage: nope
 Blokops: well apperentl alt + arrow is chrome exclisove so no
 Blabbage: ah, you can, shift+alt and then mark
 Blokops: how do you mark?
 Blabbage: so e.g. for fastest clash, you can remove 4*space for single space in multiple lines
 Blabbage: select with mouse
 Blabbage: mark with mouse
 Blokops: 0-0
 Blabbage: in JetBrains you just use alt+mouse
 Blabbage: oh, sry, this is interesting but gotta go, family needs me&#160;:)
 Blokops: :wave:
 Demon_bakugo: hi
 Fasader: hello
 TimberStalker: i just figured out that you can do n%1==0 to determine if n is an integer value. How did i not know this before
 jacek: w00t
 Husoski: For golf problems, testing n%1&gt;0 to find non-integers is a character shorter, if it's convenient to swap if and else cases.
 Husoski: (oops, that might have been useful 90 min ago...) :blush:

 Blabbage: two characters shorter&#160;:)
 Blokops: i been using is_integer() all my life
 Blokops: freaking geeks for geeks sucks at giving programing tips, is all a copy past from other sites
 Blokops: and most of the time they dont show the result of their code instead they want us to us their shitty compiler

 sophw8: how do i learn java
 Dorak: What version of F# is the application using? I can't do practically anything valid in net core 6. :disappointed_relieved:

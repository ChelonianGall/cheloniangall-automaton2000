 Snef: if your search have random it's logic
 Snef: the fails tho..
 Astrobytes: YurkovAS was wondering about the CPUs on the machines
 Illedan: Yeah, some have said they have to use 35 ms to "fix" the fails..
 YurkovAS: Snef yes, use randoms with fixed seed
 Snef: yea me too
 BeardedWhale: I use fixed seed, but since the searchtime is somewhat random, the results still vary somewhat.
 AKZOMBIE74: yo
 AKZOMBIE74: im tryna change my password on this site but i forgot it
 AKZOMBIE74: i use my google account to sign in, and i tried the password for that google account but it doesnt work
 AKZOMBIE74: can anyone help?
 JBM: find the "reset password" link
 mikelong1994: is there a proper console so I can see errors?
 AKZOMBIE74: @JBM there isn't a "reset password" link tho
 Snef: struct u there&#160;?
 struct: Snef
 struct: now I am
 cegprakash: top 20 on oware xD
 cegprakash: i go till depth 15! what a pruning!
 struct: nice cegprakash
 jacek: see, and it was without that pruning array
 jacek: wait, in this situation is draw? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/469018118">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/469018118</a>
 jacek: i thought you take the seeds from the board
 Doju: Hey, python question here:
 Doju: So i have a vector class that inherits from a numpy array
 Doju: i'd like that class to have vec.x and vec.y
 Doju: i can do that by doing self.x = self[0] and self.y = self[1] in the __init__
 Doju: but that breaks when i add two of them together for example
 Doju: if i go (vec1 + vec2).x it throws an error
 Doju: So how should I go about fixing that? Getters and setters?
 Uljahn: why don't you like to use recarrays?
 Uljahn: mixing python and numpy is generally not the best idea
 Doju: Oh huh, that's pretty much exactly what i want
 Doju: you're right
 Doju: thanks Uljahn

 cegprakash: I had a 13-8 lead in early game
 cegprakash: and it doesn't seem to matter
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 WINWINWIN: Even your CoC puzzles are CSB based MadKnight?
 WINWINWIN: You must output the length of a race track, given a number of coordinates, using the Euclidian distance . If the track has 2 coordinates, they represent a start and finish line. If the track has 3 coordinates or more, the first coordinate represents the start/finish, while the others represent checkpoints that are required to be passed through in order.
 cegprakash: the problem with minimax is it assumes there is only 1 optimal strategy for any game state
 jacek: could be more if 2 moves have the same score
 cegprakash: I rekt eulerscheZahl on Oware.. feels awesome xD

 cegprakash: 10-4 ahead still lose
 cegprakash:&#160;:\
 cegprakash: he won with 1 freaking seed

 cegprakash: 20-5 ahead and lost
 cegprakash: wuut
 darkhorse64: Won by overfeeding
 cegprakash: i seriously don't understand if I should take it as bad luck or I should predict 100 turns ahead
 cegprakash: :D
 jacek: ponies like seeds
 jacek: what is your eval? only seeds count?
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: just score
 cegprakash: and avoid getting 0 seeded
 jacek: think of something more
 cegprakash: my brain is dead
 cegprakash: 3 days no sleep
 cegprakash: only oware
 cegprakash: :D
 Alshock: xD
 cegprakash: I was trying to figure out obvious winning states
 cegprakash: but I couldn't find any
 cegprakash: may be MCTS is better
 cegprakash: and top 20 has probably more than 20 depth
 cegprakash: I only gave a depth = 9 to 15 based on no. of seeds left on board
 jacek: the one when you get 25 seeds is obvious winning
 cegprakash: my bot with timeouts do perform better than bot without timeout
 cegprakash: :D
 Uljahn: top oware are NNs i guess
 darkhorse64: 2 NN, 2 MCTS
 Csipcsirip: nn like alpha zero&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 Csipcsirip: hm gotta make my own
 darkhorse64: glhf
 jacek: with blackjack and hookers
 cegprakash: is it good to have too much seeds?
 darkhorse64: Wealth is good
 cegprakash: haha

 Embedded: Hi
 Alshock: that sounds like a good way WINWINWIN
 Alshock: I should try that
 wlesavo: im actually used to do that, because it was hard to improve and my motivation would drain out pretty quickly
 wlesavo: NS was probably the first game i was really commited to and it felt much better trying different stuff on and on
 WINWINWIN: NS?
 wlesavo: number shifting
 wlesavo: since it is an offline game you can try a lot of things, which normaly you wouldn't do, especially with python
 wlesavo: i think i tryed mcts, GA and SA with a lot of different modifications, all of these algos for the first time
 AntiSquid: on number shifting
 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 Jasperr: I'm going to try to create my first working GA on SR tonight
 Jasperr: Looks like a suitable competition
 WINWINWIN: Jasperr seems like a good idea, no collisions so very easy to simulate
 wlesavo: AntiSquid yes, but the only solid implementation was sa, other ones failed misserably
 ArianPunk: guys, are some of these puzzles buggy?
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely
 eulerscheZahl: can you elaborate on it? which puzzles? which kind of bug?
 ArianPunk: I see weird expectations in the ASCII Art puzzle
 Astrobytes: They're all bugged. So is the leaderboard. The whole site is one huge bug.
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure it's a bug in your code. ASCII art is well tested by thousands of users
 ArianPunk: the first test is the letter E
 ArianPunk: but it is expected smth like ###
 eulerscheZahl: for the first line of output that is
 ArianPunk: my first line is ###
 eulerscheZahl: missing or extra spaces?
 ArianPunk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ee6241b-b91c-4510-be97-6b42f07dc929">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ee6241b-b91c-4510-be97-6b42f07dc929</a>
 Scarfield: missing a newline?
 ArianPunk: don't think so.
 eulerscheZahl: share code
 ArianPunk: just tryna pass the first test
 jacek: is there some state of the art software for GA parameter optimization? like i give it set of parameters and it calls my fitness function and it does all the genetic shit on its own and give me the optimized parameters
 ArianPunk: I haven't finished the whole code.
 eulerscheZahl: you are missing a space in the first line of output
 eulerscheZahl: and even more spaces for lines below
 ArianPunk: just wanted to know what it does, then I'd try to write the whole thing.I added the space, no result.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/00193e65-3803-4224-94a5-47a354d4857b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/00193e65-3803-4224-94a5-47a354d4857b</a>

 ArianPunk: you mean this?
 Alshock: errr of course that depends on the ascii-art alphabet you're given as input
 ArianPunk: done
 ArianPunk: got it. thnx
 ArianPunk: I think I have to write A to Z in ascii art. takes time. not mine. but I got it.
 Astrobytes: You can't just hard-code the answers btw
 ArianPunk: yeah, just wanted to try it. see if I like the puzzle n how it works.
 Alshock: well technically on CG it's possible
 ArianPunk: not always possible.
 ArianPunk: you gotta trick it.
 Alshock: yeah, and be the lamest guy there's ever been. But it's still possible :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 ArianPunk: i reckon in this puzzle u gotta kinda hard code it anyway.
 eulerscheZahl: you won't pass with hardcoding
 ArianPunk: make all ascii arts for a to z as ur database.wait for word inputs, (eg MANHATTAN).check each of its characters, find it on ur database.
 eulerscheZahl: the alphabet is different for the last testcase
 ArianPunk: print them.
 ArianPunk: if not found, print&#160;?
 Komby: can i ask a silly question too&#160;:)&#160;?
 ArianPunk: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 IvailoManolov: go ahead bby
 LuaWurld: Anyone on lua here?
 ArianPunk: you mean my question was silly? 
 IvailoManolov: LOL
 Komby: I at doing A CHILD'S PLAY easy puzzle but i used hashmap in java and im failing because of optimisation
 eulerscheZahl: because of optimization?
 Komby: and enumerator, should i switch to some other data t ype&#160;? yes 
 Astrobytes: Your code is so highly optimised, it fails?
 ArianPunk: yeah, Euler, cant beat the last test.
 Komby: on the contrary , it isnt 
 ArianPunk: but I suppose u could trick it.
 eulerscheZahl: there's always a way around the expected solution. but what's the point if it's harder than solving the problem itself?
 ArianPunk: how would my program know what ascii art version the user wants?
 eulerscheZahl: it's part of the input
 ArianPunk: the last test's inputs are:2011MANHATTAN
 eulerscheZahl: no, that's not the full input
 ArianPunk: you mean the A to Z underneath 11 is part of the input as well?
 Komby: so im guessing i should submit my unfinished solution so others can see&#160;?
 Trice: Have any idea, what is this?input: 123 output: 2Input: 2314 output: 3
 Astrobytes: ArianPunk yes
 eulerscheZahl: only 100% solutions are visible
 ArianPunk: hmmm
 Komby: any tips how i can optimize my solution&#160;? hashmap is bad&#160;?
 ArianPunk: is it an easy puzzle for real?
 Trice: input: 1111 output: 0Input: 33278110 output: 5Input: 112233445566778899 output: 8
 Scarfield: you are clashing Trice?
 Trice: yes :D

 Scarfield: you are in world chat
 Trice: But I can't understand this problem
 Trice: Oh
 Trice: Thanks :D
 Scarfield: lol i guessed it was largest int minus the first int xD
 Astrobytes: Komby, I haven't done that puzzle but can't you just use a 2D array to represent the grid?
 eulerscheZahl: and i spoiled the clash. not even feeling sorry for the other players :imp:
 Astrobytes: spoilerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Komby: wont it be also slow to to check array values on each step&#160;?
 Trice: I exited from the clash when I asked for help.
 Astrobytes: It shouldn't be Komby
 eulerscheZahl: I approved that clash :oi don't even remember
 LuaWurld: How can i close this sh*t?
 eulerscheZahl: alt+F4
 LuaWurld: no u
 LuaWurld: I dont trust you.
 eulerscheZahl: chat? triangle at to bottom
 LuaWurld: Ty.
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol
 eulerscheZahl: now that I revealed this secret, will we lose more chatters?
 MostComplicatedUsername: No
 MostComplicatedUsername: You see...
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:)
 MostComplicatedUsername: Pressing the triangle takes WORK
 eulerscheZahl: at least it's an actual link, vimium detects it. unlike switching chats
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile I just got a clash of code invite :rage:
 MostComplicatedUsername: ...
 MostComplicatedUsername:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Is TvC still live?
 eulerscheZahl: what is tvc?
 Scarfield: ^
 Zenoscave: the JBM troll game
 eulerscheZahl: toad vs chat?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Zenoscave: troll vs castle or something
 eulerscheZahl: there's a link somewhere on the forum
 Zenoscave: ok thanks
 Zenoscave: found it!
 JBM: now with improved graphics
 Scarfield: how can you improve what is  already perfect?
 Astrobytes: That troll in fullscreen is the best thing I've seen this year.
 AbundantPuddle: perfect++?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Wow that's one abundant puddle
 AbundantPuddle: Just saw the time stamp. A bit late to the party I suppose. Lol.
 MostComplicatedUsername: mhm
 AbundantPuddle: I like the irony of your username. Lmao.
 eulerscheZahl: self-descriptive
 MostComplicatedUsername: My code for bandas is pretty simple, every turn I calculate the side with the most opponent pawns, and move in that direction. But for some reason, it only ever chooses left
 Astrobytes: You have a bug in your code.
 MostComplicatedUsername: NOOOO
 MostComplicatedUsername: Genius
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I also have a bug in my SR
 darkhorse64: Don't write an eval. You'll have no bug. Only TrueAI
 Astrobytes: Dammit, that's what's wrong with my GA, it requires no fitness function and no sim.
 darkhorse64: Yeah remove the sim 
 Astrobytes: Add some if-elses
 darkhorse64: Kidding aside, my bandas bot has no eval at all, only random rollouts
 struct: who needs eval
 Astrobytes: Not tried Bandas properly yet
 Alshock: @struct interpreted languages do
 Alshock: Ok I'm out :door:
 darkhorse64: I think my SR fitness sucks. I am stuck slightly above 12k
 struct: No yavalath rating is ruined&#160;:'(
 struct: 2 stars
 jacek: huh
 darkhorse64: Ban 
 darkhorse64: Only 5 stars allowed
 jacek: good thing it wasnt 3 stars
 Astrobytes: I ported some of my CSB code today, and it sort of works but doesn't. Will check the sim properly tomorrow.
 darkhorse64: Beware that pos and speed are truncated
 eulerscheZahl: 2 stars, cute...got 1 star on tower dereference and onitama :sob:
 Astrobytes: Yup, saw those darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: Collisions are also a bit different. The referee helps for that
 struct: damn&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'll go through it properly tomorrow morning
 struct: you have as many 1 stars as BOTH
 struct: BOTG*
 darkhorse64: Do you know of sensible parameters for CSB aside fro checkpoint count and distance to next checkpoint&#160;?
 struct: angles maybe?
 eulerscheZahl: i think it was 1 user giving 1 star ratings to 6 community multiplayers
 Astrobytes: blocker distance to enemy CP, to enemy runner, angles for sure
 struct: Like enemy blocker angle to your runner
 struct: or what astro said
 Astrobytes: there's literally *loads* of parameters you can try
 struct: I never tried any though
 struct: blocker distance to enemy cp is good
 Astrobytes: It's balancing them all that's the issue (like always)
 darkhorse64: And for runner&#160;?
 Astrobytes: distance from enemy blocker, enemy runner is covered I guess, angles again
 Astrobytes: Play around with it.
 darkhorse64: angle is what is missing from my SR fitness function
 Astrobytes: I would definitely include that
 darkhorse64: Although it's hard to define what's the right value
 Astrobytes: Yep. You don't want it going straight towards the checkpoint at all times ofc
 darkhorse64: I feel transportation illness when seeing SR replays
 Astrobytes: Even on slow speed?
 Astrobytes: (called motion-sickness btw&#160;;) )
 darkhorse64: Slow is not an option
 Astrobytes: Yeah I watch on max speed too
 Astrobytes: Mostly
 darkhorse64: forgot the right words. thanks
 darkhorse64: afk
 Astrobytes: no prob, ttyl
 ArianPunk: I went back to ascii art
 jrke: hey is this search race new
 Scarfield: yea
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 ArianPunk: last test gives me error
 Scarfield: SlowstroBytes&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hahaha Scarfandgloves :D
 Scarfield: lol xD
 Scarfield: never realised scarf was part of my name, now i cannot unsee it
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: sorrynotsorry :P
 Scarfield: .D
 ArianPunk: ascii art done
 jrke: hey search race same like CSB
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 jrke: just copying 
 Astrobytes: little bit different
 jrke: whats change
 jrke: just alternative output
 Astrobytes: The engine is a bit different, so your sim will need to take that into account
 jrke: seems recurse will be first
 Astrobytes: He *is* first
 jrke: whats your progress astrobytes
 Astrobytes: 19th/44 16,322.67 100%, no search
 Astrobytes: Currently porting my GA from CSB
 jrke: nice
 Illedan: :wave:
 Illedan: jrke, change is that there is no enemy :P
 Illedan: Just to practice the racing part
 jrke: yes 
 eulerscheZahl: and that CSB never killed any other games
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: wait, promotion...forget what i just said
 jrke: 100%
 jrke: now something else to add going
 jrke: hey how give rotation angle output
 Astrobytes: "EXPERT angle thrust"
 jrke: K
 jrke: thanks
 Astrobytes: It's at bottom of the statement&#160;;)
 BeardedWhale: Yay! Finally below 11k on Search race!
 Zenoscave: Second in TvC!!! JBM your game is fun
 Illedan: :clap: BeardedWhale!
 Zenoscave: gz BeardedWhale are you doing a sim-less ai?
 Illedan: -4 vel is the magic formula
 Zenoscave: ...
 Zenoscave: not again
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: You didn't try yet?
 351062: -3vel &gt; -4vel
 BeardedWhale: Zenoscave, no I am using GA
 Astrobytes: gj BeardedWhale
 BeardedWhale: Thx
 Astrobytes: Debugging my sim + GA rn
 Astrobytes: Think I fkd something up earlier. I blame my pain relief ofc
 Astrobytes: In Java too BeardedWhale :clap:
 Astrobytes: Very well done
 AntiSquid: left CG open and when i come back i see a bunch of clash invite, wtf? is there no cure for that shit?
 AntiSquid: what's the current game topic? speed racer?
 BeardedWhale: Yeah, I'm doing speed racer at least
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what is TvC?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, the pew pew is gone
 Illedan: Troll vs Castle PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx Illedan, didn't know
 BeardedWhale: I cannot find Troll vs Castle, where is it?

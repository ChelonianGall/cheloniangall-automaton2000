 faisalam1n: Hey
 thibpat: Hello, I'm streaming my progress on Ocean Of Code, focusing on Mine management today! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.com/thibpat">https://twitch.com/thibpat</a>
 wlesavo: blasterpoard i cant come up with fight sim, dont know where to start even
 AntiSquid: how's your herd immunity everyone?
 hkouiorp: can some one help e 
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, help the irrational constant!
 hkouiorp: i am getting the first question correct but when i am moving  to the second one the first question is wrong
 wlesavo: lol help eulersche zahl
 Ifthel: Which questions?
 hkouiorp: you guys are so rude
 Ifthel: "rude"
 hkouiorp: no not you
 hkouiorp: the others
 hkouiorp: you were kind enough to help me
 Ifthel: They weren't rude either, though
 hkouiorp: then
 hkouiorp: ok first help me then
 hkouiorp: lets chat
 hkouiorp: in clash of code
 Ifthel: No need: Private messaging works in this
 AntiSquid: hkouiorp few solutions: don't hard code, you need a general answer, don't play clash, it's a waste of time, do the contest <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a> 
 Ifthel: Anyone know how to get CodinGame to use -wall and treat warnings as errors?
 Ifthel: For C++, ofc
 Q12: Do you mean debug?
 Ifthel: Talking about compiler flags. Apparently it's possible to get CodinGame to use -O3 with pragmas, wondering if there's something for compile warnings
 Ifthel: Alternatively, I'll just test compile on my local machine
 eulerscheZahl: you can force -O3 for your own file. but that won't affect STL, e.g. vector will still be slower than it has to me
 eulerscheZahl: *has to be
 chucknorris: are you sure eulerscheZahl? even if you put the pragma over the #include &lt;vector&gt; in your file&#160;? 
 darkhorse64: It works for me
 MadKnight: yea eulerscheZahl have u tried putting pragma before vector&#160;?
 dbdr: feel to #17, resub is #8 at 5% :D
 AntiSquid: i have pragma before vector, bot still seems fast considering it does lots of redundant calculations
 dbdr: maybe I was hammered by someone spamming. or there are just small differences in the mid ranks
 wlesavo: last one
 wlesavo: it feels really close
 kovi: 5% doesnt matter
 dbdr: sure
 dbdr: but winning 8/10 would be quite improbable if you are actually worth #17/23, no?
 AntiSquid: and someone was saying ladder doesn't get shuffled
 AntiSquid: with heavy RPS element of the game, who would have thought&#160;?
 dbdr: it's also the influence of last matches when some people submit constantly and others rarely
 WINWINWIN: Crazy hard gold boss in OoC? only 23 in Legend?
 Nerchio: it's pretty good :D
 eulerscheZahl: no i'm not sure Csipcsirip, just repeating what others said
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN i doubt it's crazy hard also this will stay as a multi for a long time without boss being improved, so better this way
 struct: Im not sure how it works
 eulerscheZahl: ranking feels random
 struct: But I know it isnt true O3
 chucknorris: one thing is sure, its much faster if you put the pragma before the std includes
 eulerscheZahl: zhmyh almost last for ages, climbed a bit
 eulerscheZahl: dropping again now
 dbdr: I don't know, I've been moving #8 to #13-ish for a long time. not #3 to #22
 eulerscheZahl: it's random, but not THAT random
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: imagining a leaderboad with 100 papers, 100 stones and 100 scissors in that order. the ranking would be perfectly stable between the three categories I think&#160;:)
 dbdr: papers would stay on top because they would nevere play against scissors
 Ifthel: chucknorris could it be that CodinGame has includes before  your code? It would explain why I'm able to use unordered_map without including it
 Ifthel: Would also mean a pragma before the include would be pointless
 pb4: lfthul highly improbable
 pb4: What are your includes&#160;?
 Ifthel: algorithm, iostream, memory, string, vector
 wlesavo: WINWINWIN actually around 10, but not the same version, i wonder where would it be placed in legend actually
 pb4: only those&#160;?
 dbdr: wlesavo you can try&#160;:)
 dbdr: you have the code
 Ifthel: Yep, nothing else. Compiles fine on codingame but I need to include unordered_map when I compile locally
 struct: What compiler do you use offline?
 struct: locally*
 wlesavo: dbdr ok, ill actually submit it
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Ifthel: llvm (specifically the clang-cl driver)
 wlesavo: what day was the legennd?
 pb4: lfthel&#160;: I'm really curious, can you provide sample code that compiles on cg&#160;?
 dbdr: friday evening
 Ifthel: Sure, just a sec pb4
 eulerscheZahl: keep in mind that CG has different machines to run out code on
 Ifthel: Also, with experimentation, it seems that if I don't include &lt;algorithm&gt;, unordered_map is missing
 Ifthel: Meaning that codingame does something wacky with algorithm?
 dbdr: or uses a different standard version than you?
 dbdr: I would hope CG uses the same compilers on all machines
 Ifthel: Following compiles fine in codingame:
 Ifthel: Fails to compile with llvm clang-cl
 Ifthel: (using /std:c++latest on clang-cl)
 struct: Ifthel seems strange yeah
 dbdr: CG uses g++ 9.2.1 mode C++17
 struct: Even on tech.io you need to include it
 Ifthel: Possible that MSVC's algorithm lacks unordered_map while the stdlib on codingame has it
 Ifthel: In which case the question is which stdlib codingame uses
 dbdr: doesn't the C++ standard specify such things?
 pb4: wow
 pb4: that's weird
 Ifthel: It should specify it, but whether the implementation is compliant is another story&#160;:)
 pb4: g++ locally doesn't compile that sample code
 dbdr: are you testing with C++17?
 struct: yeah
 struct: They must do something 
 Ifthel: But why?
 Ifthel: The plot thickens...
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/LiaBzI1">https://tech.io/snippet/LiaBzI1</a>
 struct: on tech io I guess the options are different
 struct: than on CG
 DanTheMan832: Im a bit overwhelmed by the contest... anyone have any tips on where to start
 aCat: track your positions
 aCat: i mean visited squares
 aCat: make AI that goes to any nonvisited square
 aCat: if that's not possible then surface
 aCat: that's step zero
 Ifthel: Start by having your AI not explode, basically
 DanTheMan832: thanks
 aCat: step one - change that so you choose the square to move into the one with the most available cells
 dbdr: Ifthel <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://godbolt.org/z/4Tdwg-">https://godbolt.org/z/4Tdwg-</a>
 dbdr: works outside of CG too
 aCat: you will get to next league certainly with the latter, not sure about the former
 aCat: in higher league you have to start shooting the opponent and tracking his movements at least in basic
 Ifthel: dbdr whoa
 aCat: have fun, if any problems - just ask here
 dbdr: the -std=c++17 was required
 Ifthel: Still won't compile with clang-cl /std:c++17 though
 Ifthel: This is going to give me nightmares
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99354b1a-5dbc-4d29-9f84-2cb118a23116">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/99354b1a-5dbc-4d29-9f84-2cb118a23116</a>
 shootiz: I'm a bit stuck in the silver league, any ideas on what should I improve guys?
 pb4: Looks like it works with gcc9
 pb4: and not with gcc8
 pb4: on godbolt
 Ifthel: Should mention I'm using clang 8.0.1
 Ifthel: According to compiler explorer it works in clang 9.0.0
 dbdr: wlesavo gold boss ranking #12? almost #10
 wlesavo: with quite a few over 50% winrates actually <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/ocean-of-code/wlesavo">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/ocean-of-code/wlesavo</a>
 wlesavo: so there goes my improvements
 Ifthel: Same thing happens with vector. It seems that algorithm now includes the containers library. Mystery solved ig
 dbdr: gold boss might win the contest at the end :D
 wlesavo: oh, didnt notice its 24 now
 dbdr: just remove it now, let people change their bots to optimize against each other, and put it back at the last minute :D
 dbdr: k4ng0u grats!
 dbdr: second Java in legend
 aCat: BTW - how it works if both players got 0hp
 aCat: who wins?
 wlesavo: draw triggered
 k4ng0u: thx. Sill impressed how wlesavo got there  in Python and keep so many people in gold
 darkhorse64: How did you make it&#160;? Mine avoiddance&#160;? Shoot and evade&#160;?
 wlesavo: ok, so the gold boss actually landed around 12 :slight_smile:
 Nerchio: some of my turns in java show they take &gt;50 seconds and i don't lose
 Nerchio: any ideas?
 Nerchio: &gt;50 ms
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: there is a small grace period
 dbdr: but I think it accumtulates over time
 dbdr: so 52ms might work a few times, but not every turn
 Nerchio: i sometimes have 70+ ^.-
 dbdr: would you prefer to lose?&#160;;)
 struct: you probably have something wrong
 wlesavo: no, its actually possible to have a little more then 50
 struct: but 70?
 wlesavo: but not consistently
 dbdr: calculate the sum of overtime over the whole game
 dbdr: how much is it?
 DanTheMan832: guys why is my  cursor a yellow flashing rectangle???
 DanTheMan832: how do I fix it
 dbdr: DanTheMan832 press Insert?
 kovi: insert
 Nerchio: 4856 ms over 282 turn game i dont count first round
 Nerchio: ~34 ms/turn
 DanTheMan832: thanks
 Nerchio: another game 2506 ms over 144 turns so i had 72 turns which is ~34,8 ms/turn
 Nerchio: i found 106 ms turn but 
 Nerchio: somebody told me java on codinggame sometimes takes longer turns because of garbage collection so maybe they take that into account idk
 fasil: hy
 eulerscheZahl: Nerchio how are you meansuring? after reading the first line of input?
 Nerchio: at the beginning of while(true)
 eulerscheZahl: congrats k4ng0u
 struct: you must read after first input
 eulerscheZahl: start the timer after the input or you stop the opponent too
 eulerscheZahl: read after input?
 pb4: did Nagrarok improve his AI or did he get pushed in legend and is automatically 13th&#160;?
 Nerchio: ok if i changed the timer after reading input its much better
 Nerchio: and i was testing it on opponent who has a bot in javascript so if i was taking his turn into account obviously it was long :D
 Nerchio: now my average turn is ~1ms longest 35
 dbdr: it's also the time taken by the referee
 Nagrarok: pb4 I got pushed yesterday, and improved a little bit today too
 Nagrarok: but was already 15th after push
 Nerchio: so obviously my 30 ms turn is when they silence and i have 1200 agents
 Nerchio: should be faster in c++ obviously :P
 Nerchio: how hard is it to run the game locally?
 wlesavo: ok, so there is no difference in rank between golden boss and my current better and improved code :expressionless:
 dbdr: Nerchio honestly the easiest might be the code a mini-referee yourself. the rules are simple
 dbdr: especially if you trust your bot to output valid actions and don't need to check that
 Nerchio: i am going for a trophy the longest messy code
 Nerchio: already 1600 lines
 Kh4z: xD
 wlesavo: nah, you gonna lose
 Nerchio: who's the contender
 etzl: I can't understand the gravity tumbler problem I mean it's all ok until the map part it says if number is odd width lines of height and if it's even something else but how many # should i put in each line?
 735487: XLP I love you )))) I am in legend now
 wlesavo: lol +2
 wlesavo: grac
 XLP: I push you amurushkin &amp; Valdemar in legend (but not me) :pensive:
 735487: maybe you have better chances now without us there
 Q12: how to print in javascript without getting to new line? (console.log)
 Valdemar: XLP thanks man, it was though legend this timeGood look to join us any time soon
 pb4: siman :fire:
 DanTheMan832: just to clarify guys does torpedo_cooldown represent the charge
 pb4: siman :fire:
 pb4: woops sorry
 eulerscheZahl: getting crowded in legend&#160;:/
 DanTheMan832: @eulerscheZahl does torpedo_cooldown represent how much you have charged it
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 DanTheMan832: thanks
 wlesavo: nice XLP
 Valdemar: XLP welcome to the legend
 XLP: ty :grinning:
 kovi: grat
 Crashterpiece: is there any good way to get the full output stream to a file? it always stops within the debugging
 Nerchio: i think only setting up the game locally can help you there
 Nerchio: or just limit your debug info 
 wlesavo: you probably need smth like flush = true
 dbdr: if it ends with ... it means it has been cut because if was too long
 NormantasStankevicius: Yesterday I went to sleep and forgot to save my code
 NormantasStankevicius: F
 NormantasStankevicius: Guys, when you decide where to go (when you floodfill)
 NormantasStankevicius: do you calculate every possible direction
 NormantasStankevicius: how much can you move
 NormantasStankevicius: and compare?
 Nerchio: kind of
 Nerchio: but my flood fill wastes space atm
 NormantasStankevicius: Until a certain point of moves?
 NormantasStankevicius: cause I am thinking
 Nerchio: you can do floodfill on every move it doesnt take much time
 NormantasStankevicius: do I have enought time to compare everything on C#
 NormantasStankevicius: well
 ZarthaxX: c# is quite fast yes, just 4 directions
 NormantasStankevicius: I'll test every possible move
 NormantasStankevicius: I mean, every turn I want to calculate
 NormantasStankevicius: let say I take left
 NormantasStankevicius: and how many turns I can take
 NormantasStankevicius: till no more space
 ZarthaxX: what?
 NormantasStankevicius: AKA, every turn calculate the longest possible path
 ZarthaxX: it's really hard to calculate the perfect path to fill the grid
 ZarthaxX: nah that's quite insane
 NormantasStankevicius: With a bit of recursion 
 ZarthaxX: it's super big you cant bruteforce it
 NormantasStankevicius: I have the idea how, but my issue is speed
 NormantasStankevicius: well, I might do it till a certain point
 NormantasStankevicius: let's say
 NormantasStankevicius: up to 10turns
 NormantasStankevicius: or less
 ZarthaxX: i do depth 9
 ZarthaxX: you can try doing that yes
 NormantasStankevicius: for now I will try to do every turn, but scale down 
 NormantasStankevicius: if speed is my issue
 NormantasStankevicius: as there is also the calculation of the enemy
 ZarthaxX: you wont get to do all the turns till you filled board
 NormantasStankevicius: that eats time
 NormantasStankevicius: idk, I will try to prolong my path
 NormantasStankevicius: as right now
 NormantasStankevicius: it's go up down left right
 NormantasStankevicius: and do not go
 NormantasStankevicius: if the path there is a 1x1 block deadend
 NormantasStankevicius: if I have somewhere else to go
 ZarthaxX: ah ok yeah
 ZarthaxX: space for improvement
 NormantasStankevicius: so for now I will try to find the longest path
 NormantasStankevicius: with recursion and just scale down
 NormantasStankevicius: to fit for speed
 ZarthaxX: sounds good
 NormantasStankevicius: it should be also possible, as i heard people almost getting to silver with just pathfinding
 DanTheMan832: How do you stop bot from battling
 NormantasStankevicius: your or enemy?
 DanTheMan832: mine
 NormantasStankevicius: what league?
 DanTheMan832: wood 1:(
 NormantasStankevicius: hmm hmmm
 NormantasStankevicius: how do you predict the enemy?
 DanTheMan832: I don't yet
 DanTheMan832: I only started today
 DanTheMan832: I just submitted it but now my bot won't stop battling other peoples
 yfprojects: What do you mean by battling?
 DanTheMan832: When I click on last battles it shows tons of battles
 DanTheMan832: I want it to stop starting new ones
 yfprojects: Just submit again
 wlesavo: DanTheMan832 it will stop after finishing games that needed to calculate its rank, it shouldnot bother you
 DanTheMan832: ok
 DanTheMan832: can you use more than one ability in a turn. eg torpedo and sonar
 RMuskovets: I tried to write something for the Ocean Code challenge but its somewhat hard and idk what to start from
 RMuskovets: can you plz recommend smth?)
 yfprojects: yes @DanTheMan832
 NormantasStankevicius: Start from making the grid
 NormantasStankevicius: of the map
 NormantasStankevicius: and a basic move
 yfprojects: but you  have to use at least one, which doesnt have to be MOVE
 aCat: RMuskovets remember visited cells.And go in the direction you do not repeat position. If there is no such possibility - make surface move
 RMuskovets: I mean, I've put down some code that generates a matrix from the map and possible moves list and struggle what to do now
 yfprojects: Tracking
 aCat: good start
 tobk: At least in the lower leages, it does not really matter where you move. Focus on finding out there the enemy is, then attack when you get close.
 NormantasStankevicius: ^
 NormantasStankevicius: that is what I did
 NormantasStankevicius: and still
 NormantasStankevicius: basic tracking
 NormantasStankevicius: I left wood 100~
 NormantasStankevicius: and got to silver 400~
 RMuskovets: But I only know the sector where the enemy moves and nothing else
 tobk: parse the opponents commands and try to find out as much as you can from that. the good thing is: you can reuse this part no matter what's your actual strategy.
 yfprojects: Will your Programm be blocked while opponents turn?
 tobk: it's a turn-based game, so yes. you do your turn(s9, then the opponent, then you again, etc.
 tobk: *turn(s)
 RMuskovets: Can I skip a turn?
 RMuskovets: e.g. to gather some more data from my opponent
 tobk: not really. if you skip, you SURFACE, which hurts you in many ways. also, why skip? just moving around lets you charge your power-ups
 RMuskovets: oh, makes sense
 tobk: but it's a good idea not to fire TORPEDOs blindly whenever you can, as those also give away your position (and that of the opponent, *wink*)
 tobk: "But I only know the sector where the enemy moves and nothing else" You can know a lot more than that. You see what the enemy did, which direction he moved (and thus where he came from), where he fired a torpedo (and thus where he has to be close to), etc.
 yfprojects: If op moves left, you know that he couldnt have started in the leftmost column
 Uljahn: or to the right of any surface
 wlesavo: another +1 
 yfprojects: wlesavo do you know a good way to run a thread or process UNTIL it gets notified?
 hkouiorp: care to help
 wlesavo: yfprojects not really, no
 yfprojects: this one hkouiorp
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.caretohelp.org/">http://www.caretohelp.org/</a>
 Uljahn: or just ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but if you want to change my code to get a lot of experience
 yfprojects: Thats how you are thinking Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but might be a good candidate
 yfprojects: maybe
 Famout: The more I don't touch my code the better I do o_o since submitting in wood 2, I went to wood 1, then over night went to bronze rank 30, now at rank 3.... 
 yfprojects: :thumbsup:
 Famout: My ship doesn't even fire a torp, just evades... Thanks Codin gods? 
 yfprojects: The gold boss seems to go high as well
 eulerscheZahl: those who were close to the boss promoted now
 wlesavo: yeah, quite a few today
 LuckyJ.: Hi guys,
 yfprojects: There Emacs or Vim shortcuts
 yfprojects: look at SETTINGS
 LuckyJ.: Thx!
 Nerchio: using silence before putting a mine is so nasty
 Counterbalance: LuckyJ. also see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://defkey.com/ace-editor-shortcuts">https://defkey.com/ace-editor-shortcuts</a>
 wlesavo: Nerchio dam, how didnt i think of that one, thx
 Nerchio: woops&#160;:)
 Nerchio: it breaks mine detection pretty much
 yfprojects: Can u prevent getting hit by mines through silencing?
 Nerchio: i mean you don't move during the enemy turn so hw?
 Nerchio: how
 wlesavo: im not sure it worth to keep a mine until you silence, but in my bot there even was no such possibility 
 RMuskovets: my bot finally doesn't move to illegal positions =)
 RMuskovets: i'm so happy
 RMuskovets: even does SURFACE when needed
 yfprojects: How long would it take to narrow down opp positions to about 9 if he silences as soon as possible?
 aaronshenhao: Lmao why adblocker says 252 blocks for this page
 aaronshenhao: That's the highest I've ever seen it
 wlesavo: yfprojects it depends
 RMuskovets: i have 0
 RMuskovets: aaronshenhao
 wlesavo: on lucky sonars or mine triggers at least
 wlesavo: without that you can almost never go below 9 i guess
 yfprojects: But 18 would be ok, actually. Is that possible?
 wlesavo: with spam silence i believe yes, especially if opponent doesnot use sonar and with some preventive surfacings
 wlesavo: not really a viable strategy though
 yfprojects: Cause Mines dont seem that strong in legend
 pb4: they aren't strong because we avoid them
 pb4: they don't deal direct damage
 wlesavo: kovi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/449083226">https://www.codingame.com/replay/449083226</a>
 pb4: however, they deal indirect damage by zoning us out of lots of places
 pb4: --&gt; mines are strong
 wlesavo: but they restrict movements, and eventually deal some damage
 yfprojects: And why dont you avoid opponents?
 RMuskovets: should i add torpedo code before submitting bot to "arena"? it behaves like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/449083638">https://www.codingame.com/replay/449083638</a> now
 dbdr: RMuskovets no need to worry, you can submit and improve it later
 RMuskovets: oh, great)
 aaronshenhao: Anyone noticed the editor supports multiple cursors o_O
 RMuskovets: looks like nearly every bot i've competed with has no torpedo logic )))
 AntiSquid: you're in wood league RMuskovets
 RMuskovets: yeah, ik
 AntiSquid: so only dumb bots there, sorry
 RMuskovets:&#160;:(
 RMuskovets: but at least ive managed to beat them)
 yfprojects: like mine, he is just moving upwards
 wlesavo: Nerchio turned out this silence -&gt; mine can even make some of the top bots to crush, at least before i didnt notice that
 Nerchio: :D
 Nerchio: glad to hear that
 ZarthaxX: crush or crash?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 RMuskovets: f*king cpt levine
 wlesavo: crash, yeah
 AntiSquid: silence-&gt;mine as opposed to mine-&gt;silence?
 wlesavo: y
 wlesavo: well not really forcing that yet
 yfprojects: pb4 and wlesavo why arent you avoiding opponents aswell?
 pb4:&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 wlesavo: it involves long term planning, which i dont have 
 wlesavo: by long i mean &gt;1 turn
 yfprojects: :smiley: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/449091412">https://www.codingame.com/replay/449091412</a>
 pb4: other players avoid more than you think I do&#160;?
 yfprojects: no
 yfprojects: You seem to try to elimate causes of death
 yfprojects: which were mines and now are opponents
 ZarthaxX: you are wood2 and you already analyzed everything?
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 wlesavo: yfprojects its easy to make situation worse trying to avoid opponent, at least without a good reason
 DEIZ21: hello everyone
 DEIZ21: I am looking for an eclipse plugin which merge several classes into a single file (removing the packages, public in front of the classes ...) to be able to work correctly locally and synchronize with CG .. can connoisseurs tell me one?
 DEIZ21: sorry (google translate :p)
 yfprojects: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/tiramon/CGFileMerge">https://github.com/tiramon/CGFileMerge</a> Thats for merging files
 yfprojects: But it isnt a plugin
 Nerchio: it's so discouraging when you end the day worse than you started&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: yeah  better to just quit right?
 eulerscheZahl: summary of my day
 Nerchio: i mean in gold there is 300 places so lucky run can land you high and bad run can run you far ;P
 Illedan: Hi
 ZarthaxX: hi illo
 Illedan: Wazzup?
 RMuskovets: Ocean of Code of course)
 DEIZ21: yfprojects  thx, doest it watch for directory changes?
 RMuskovets: oh, great, my bot now checks for all possible torpedo positions
 RMuskovets: now to add enemy tracking &amp; firing
 DEIZ21: Ilkledan, does your bot uses simulation process, monte carlo, or GA?
 Illedan: I'll keep some secrets for now&#160;:)
 DEIZ21: ok, bu if so, plz try to make a presentation on your code without the eval function, it would be very instructive
 DEIZ21: for all codingamers
 Illedan: Sure, I'll see what I can do after the contest&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: getting top1 illo?
 Illedan: I have a big rewrite on the side which I have big hopes for
 Illedan: But tomorrow it's back to work and all that&#160;:(
 Illedan: (still from home though)
 DEIZ21: good luck hope u get the first place&#160;!
 Illedan: Thx, will try
 ZarthaxX: u will have time to code anyway :P
 Illedan: ^^
 idkhow2codee: Is it possible to write bot as real ai(neural network) here?
 eulerscheZahl: only if you ship your own framework and fit it into 100k chars
 eulerscheZahl: some even did that
 Illedan: There are some posts about it on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article</a>
 idkhow2codee: k thanks I was just curious
 tobk: It's weird how random the ranking in Gold seems to be. My bot wanders anywhere between 120th and 180th...
 tobk: (at least for that region; in the higher-ups it's probably less random)
 ZarthaxX: not really lol
 tobk: not weird or not random?
 tobk: or in the higher-ups too?
 ZarthaxX: it's kind fo random anyway
 ZarthaxX: whole contest :P
 tobk: so, if the thing runs another month everyone eventually ends up in legend? whoo!
 ZarthaxX: i dont think so
 ZarthaxX: there is some skill obv but sometimes u cant tell diff between bots
 ZarthaxX: like what happened for one to be better than other
 ZarthaxX: maybe the opposite happens onanother submit
 ZarthaxX: that kind of stuff
 k4ng0u: tobk your bot will be particularly good on some kind of maps and bad on others. if you are matched up with ppl doing better than you on your good maps  or worse than you on your bad ones it can create a huge uncertainty in your final ranking
 eulerscheZahl: and even is you have another month or even longer, most won't take the time. there's another contest starting in early Max
 eulerscheZahl: May
 eulerscheZahl: my bot is best, when the opponent spawns in a small lake and i'm in the large one. sadly legend bots don't do that anymore&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: so u fill nicely
 ZarthaxX: lol
 k4ng0u: lol
 Nerchio: i didn't bother to fix that yet it happens so rarely
 Nerchio: i timeoutd gold boss :D
 fluxtransistor: I thought @eulerscheZahl was one of the people programming the bots?
 fluxtransistor: Or do they just machine learn their own strategy
 eulerscheZahl: everyone can program a bot now
 tobk: fluxtransistor AFAIK only the Wood bosses are provided by the creators of the game, Bronze and up are selected from among the submissions, so the creator of a game does not necessarily have to end up at the top
 Quidome: wow, done my first Rust solution, that was a steep learning curve:)
 fluxtransistor: I was a bit confused as I only just began the contest
 MadKnight: can u know if enemy lost health from a torpedo or from a mine&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: input has enemy health
 Quidome: Can also be surface damage
 tobk: I think he meant "whether it was a torpedo or a mine"?
 Quidome: Nop
 tobk: if it's surface damage, you know it from the last orders
 Quidome: For that reason i only shoot or trigger&#160;:)
 Quidome: But, that said, he can also take damage from his own trigger or torpedo
 Quidome: :P
 tobk: my tracking is pretty good (I think), but still missing a good strategy, i.e. what to do with it
 tobk: apart from moving around randomly, avoiding deadends and firing when chances for a hit are good
 Quidome: Owning space by laying mines
 tobk: sure, particularly in the early game when Idon't know where to torpedo
 Nerchio: so torpedo cooldown input returns how much 'energy' you have or?
 tobk: also have very basic mine detection, but breaks down at silence (and not sure I want to do the refactoring that would be necessary to change that)
 tobk: cooldown == 0 -&gt; can use that action
 tobk: kind of confusing that it's opposite to the UI
 Nerchio: yea thats why i have my own counter but somehow its failing sometimes i think
 Quidome: that info is redundant, you have it without the server telling you
 Quidome: I don't use it
 Quidome: @tobk, do you use opponent trigger for tracking?
 tobk: no, my mine detection is not good enough for that
 tobk: I mean, yes, I could still prune away a few possible positions, but again would require quite a bit of a refactoring
 Quidome: Brute force kill move?
 tobk: que?
 Quidome: do all possible options and see if one of themkills the opponent
 tobk: ah, no, that not either. might be an idea, thanks
 Quidome: in any combination
 Quidome: Works pretty well
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you should definitely do it
 eulerscheZahl: SURFACE|SILENCE|TORPEDO for higher kill range
 eulerscheZahl: and in combination with mine triggering you can even kill the opponent despite not knowing the location
 Quidome: Exactly, was nice to do
 Quidome: Had this idea from you btw
 RMuskovets: hmm... what's the "general" algorithm for tracking enemy?
 tobk: that's actually pretty cool. if opp health &lt;= 2, check if he is "in range" and then just hit him...
 fluxtransistor: Keep a history of their moves
 tobk: so far I just had a general "fight or flee" heuristic
 fluxtransistor: And see if they are impossible from the starting locations
 eulerscheZahl: i even saw my bot going for the kill with 3HP remaining in combination with mines
 tobk: yes, I have move history for basic mine tracking and "relative visited" positions for narrowing down their silence-blur
 Quidome: I do the following, for every possible starting move of the opponent do his order. Keep the starting move if possible  otherwise throw it away
 fluxtransistor: Same here
 Quidome: And you can use a lot, don't forget opponent life
 Quidome: silence gave me a headache
 Quidome:&#160;:)
 Quidome: furthermore, lookahead
 Quidome: well, lot's of things to choose from :D
 RMuskovets: Hmm... the bots here in Wood 1 league are mostly dumb but my one is very good at not getting "torpeded"))
 RMuskovets: Like in this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449205170">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449205170</a>
 RMuskovets: Can I have a multi-threaded bot? E.g. one thread does pathfinding and the other - everything elese
 RMuskovets: else*
 Swagboy: I think you can't have more than one thread
 pmor: I believe you can, but your bot runs on only 1 core
 RMuskovets: Anyway I'm gonna try now)
 pmor: context switching and synchronization will make it not optimal
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl did you have a broken bot in the previous submit?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: added an explosion twice to my tracker in some conditions
 eulerscheZahl: and then couldn't find the opponent anymore
 eulerscheZahl: this version has the experimental feature added the way i wanted it. let's see if it's any better
 kovi: interesting, multiplte submit from top4 lowered our score from 32-33 to 30
 eulerscheZahl: oh, royale joined us
 _Royale: eulerscheZahl: gold boss was a nightmare&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: but you did it, congrats
 eulerscheZahl: legend league just feels incomplete without some players
 eulerscheZahl: still waiting for Neuman n to join us
 kovi: re-curse cough
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 CedricR: does someone did the ANEO sponsored puzzle I habe a code, and when i excute it i get an Erorr that my value is wrong, but when i check this value on my own it seems right.
 Nerchio: 1 submit place 150 another place 60 ... 
 CedricR: what do you mean?
 AntiSquid: it is very random nerchio
 AntiSquid: i can get anywhere between 100 and 300 actually :D
 CedricR: @AntiSquid is there a support way if i need help?
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by support way?
 AntiSquid: generally people just ask questions in chat and if someone knows the answer they might help
 CedricR: okay
 elderlybeginner: is there a good way to copy code into outside storage?
 elderlybeginner: from cg to hd or github or any other way?
 AntiSquid: i keep it in files on my local machine
 AntiSquid: you could have a local repo
 elderlybeginner: any way to export all or just open, copy, paste?
 AntiSquid: github everyone can see them
 AntiSquid: well you could use codingame sync i think
 AntiSquid: which means you code locally and then push your code into the IDE
 elderlybeginner: I would like to import it from CG to my local or github. Manually that's a lot of work
 AntiSquid: check how this guy does it:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/codingame">https://www.twitch.tv/codingame</a> elderlybeginner or search CG sync, i think that's the name
 AntiSquid: just copy paste to local lol
 elderlybeginner: well, there are like 30-50 puzzles I completed&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ya no other way
 AntiSquid: if you want to share your solutions, there's a button on the puzzle once you completed it
 elderlybeginner: nah, I'm sharing. But I would like to have them on my local, to look into it with my tools, to make i better and to learn something 
 AntiSquid: copy paste to local drive :D
 elderlybeginner: so manual. OK
 Nerchio: i literally jumped 120 with in gold with the same code
 Nerchio: 120 places*
 str8flows: nice
 elderlybeginner: i jump from silver to gold yesterday with the same code
 AntiSquid: gold is flooding
 Nerchio: gold is the equivalent of elo hell
 blasterpoard: there is no elo hell, you're just bad&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: the key is to not look at rank, keep improving your bot and benchmarking
 str8flows: obvious, but its nice to look at rank sometimes
 CedricR: does someone did the ANEO sponsored puzzle I habe a code, and when i excute it i get an Erorr that my value is wrong, but when i check this value on my own it seems right.
 icecream17: it's km per hour to meters per second
 elderlybeginner: check forum, there same issues with rounding
 CedricR: i used as anwser 68 km per hour there is no rounding error, when i try it to calculate without the computer i get the answer that i should work
 icecream17: which test case
 CedricR: test case 5
 CedricR: there you have 3 lights with 300m, 1500m and 3000m with 30s, 20s and 10s
 CedricR: I choose 68 km/h = 18.75 m/s 
 CedricR: This would mean i arrive at the first light after 16 seconds, cleary green
 wlesavo: lol easy #3 while whole top is resubing
 blasterpoard: wlesavo thanks for boosting my rating, btw
 CedricR: After 80 seconds at the second light, but if change every 20 s it should be green from the 80th to the 99th second, so green
 CedricR: and after 160 sendonds the third light, which also be green with 10s per interval
 icecream17: 68km/h = (19 - 1/9)mps
 icecream17: At (3040 - (160/9))ms = 160s = green
 CedricR: okay, thanks
 icecream17: But at 3000 it's red
 wlesavo: i spended like couple of hours on aneo, ended up giving up on it, end month later realised i read the statement wrong, and the distances are counting from the start, and not between each other 
 wlesavo: the funny thing was i still got most of the cases right
 wlesavo: and only couple of them were wrong
 icecream17: this puzzle seems tedious
 TheSkolar: Hello everyone! I'm kinda proud of myself that I got into Gold League 3 days since I started the challenge. Any hints to get even better? 
 TheSkolar: I feel that at this rank there are no more simple gamechangers to implement...
 Ifthel: Maybe improve predicting where the enemy's location is?
 Ifthel: Either through probability or better deduction?
 TheSkolar: Well, i track almost everything
 DEIZ21: even on mine triggerring?
 TheSkolar: Yes
 Illedan: Do you avoid mines?
 DEIZ21: do u continue to track mine triggering after u reset the list of possibles paths?
 TheSkolar: Not yet, but I thought about it
 DEIZ21: Illedan do u continue to track mine triggering after u reset the list of possibles paths?
 blasterpoard: TheSkolar there's a couple of things; f.e. using silence when you detect that opponent could torpedo you in the next turn, torpedoing before moving whenever possible (to charge it again), ...
 blasterpoard: get this right and you should be able to get to top gold
 Illedan: Yeah
 blasterpoard: just don't throw fights
 TheSkolar: sure, so i need to track what opponent might know about me to react
 TheSkolar: and start avoiding these damn mines
 blasterpoard: that's about it
 Illedan: Yeah, should be enough for legend
 blasterpoard: I got to legend without fighting
 Illedan: Fighting
 Illedan:&#160;?
 TheSkolar: Without fighting? Just mines and opponents' stupidity?&#160;;)
 blasterpoard: Illedan the only thing I did in torpedo fights was "fire torpedo if average dmg is &gt; 0.75"
 blasterpoard: and silence if he can hit me
 Illedan: I have something similar
 Illedan: still
 Illedan: 1 if before and after the move is sorted :D
 blasterpoard: I fixed the the torpedo thing
 DanTheMan832: is your code svaed if u submit?
 Ifthel: Yes
 Ifthel: Also saved if you test it
 CedricR: when i want to execute a special print command 5 times and another 3 times after that, how can i do this, without declaring an extra variable, which increase every game loop
 Ifthel: As in you want to execute MSG for a number of turns in a row?
 Ifthel: Or something like that
 blasterpoard: btw is anyone already using mines like this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/448843760">https://www.codingame.com/replay/448843760</a>
 CedricR: yes, in my example i want to move the char 5 times in a row into the south direction (print("S")
 Illedan: What is that blasterpoard?
 Illedan: What is "like this"?
 blasterpoard: Illedan fram 181-187
 Illedan: Ye ValGrowth does it
 blasterpoard: I'm thinking about turning it on in my leaderboard bot, but I want info about different stuff now
 Swagboy: blasterpoard my bot does it sometimes
 Swagboy: Maybe not for the good reason tho
 Ifthel: CedricR You chould just print out MOVE S [Action]  5 times in a row or something. Best to use a for loop for that, which uses a variable but anything else would be bad practice
 Ifthel: Having said that, if this is for a bot, you're better off recalculating what action you want to take on every turn
 kovi: nice combo blaster. but illedan could have surface escaped
 blasterpoard: kovi ofc; but who has a bot that thinks about that?
 DEIZ21: Illedan it seems u dont track opponent torpedo charge (seen in the share of blaster) your bot go near the opponent and didnt notice it ll lose just after
 icecream17: surface more and more? what a great idea!!! i need to implement this...
 Illedan: Correct DEIZ21. my bot is very stupid at the moment&#160;:)
 Illedan: And kovi, my bot never surfaces when there is a mine below it :P 
 kovi: i do eval with surface. not lookahead though
 Illedan: I'll just make a bot that wrecks blaster earlier than this..
 blasterpoard: Illedan that shouldn't be hard
 Illedan: I just need 6 days, 9 hours and 30 min
 Illedan: * 10 hours
 Illedan: need 1 more round of benchmarks
 Illedan: Anyways, Im off. gn
 AntiSquid: -9 hours
 __KAPPA__: I can beat the wood 1 league bot the majority of the times but when I submit it to the leaderboard it isn't able to get to the top
 __KAPPA__: Also when I submit the code the initial ranking seems very strange
 rwilson: __KAPPA__ the 'better than the boss' is about your score, not whether you can beat the boss head to head. I suggest you swap your opponent out in the IDE for a few others near the top of your league and see what they are doing that beats your bot.  Your score comes from # of wins against others in league, and they all can have slightly different strategies
 __KAPPA__: Ok I understand. 
 blasterpoard: __KAPPA__ I looked at one of your games; I think your problem is that you bot sabotages itself by random movement even against weak opponents, that's why you have trouble climbing the league
 __KAPPA__: The bot in this league use a very dumb strategy but my bot is unable to beat it :grimacing:
 __KAPPA__: blasterpoard Yes I need to change that
 __KAPPA__: I didn't pay much attention to it
 Zenoscave: blaster do you just do tree pruning for your fight sim?
 blasterpoard: Zenoscave no comment
 Zenoscave: damn
 Zenoscave: I feel I'm missing something crucial for my bot for legend
 Zenoscave: Can't figure it out
 __KAPPA__: blasterpoard Against very week bots, the ones that only silence, I don't know how to find them
 blasterpoard: __KAPPA__ then your tracking isn't good enough
 __KAPPA__: I track precisely every position the enemy bot can be
 blasterpoard: top bots remember all possible paths the opponent could have taken, not just the positions where they might end up 
 __KAPPA__: So I have to keep in mind that enemy bots cannot cross their path. I hadn't thought about that
 __KAPPA__: Thanks
 blasterpoard: just make sura that you don't timeout, because the number of paths grows exponentially
 blasterpoard: each silence can multiply the number of paths by up to 13
 __KAPPA__: Ok
 __KAPPA__: I just felt very annoyed because I had put a lot of effort in my bot only to see it loose against a very dumb strategy
 AntiSquid: how do i know for sure i track all paths? i don't time out and it seems like i track everything&#160;:/
 Trzcinae: siema
 icecream17: 166 possible opponent positions in map with very very few islands.... SILENCE! (you lose)
 icecream17: Yes! I finally DONT timeout against this person in 400something place!
 Nerchio: 166 positions?
 Nerchio: try 1200 agents
 icecream17: agents? (im such a noob)
 AntiSquid: is the gold boss random?&#160;:/
 Zenoscave: yes AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: wow ....
 Zenoscave: exactly
 Nerchio: antisquid i saw you on the list while going up and down myself
 Nerchio: you looking for legend?
 wlesavo: AntiSquid sorry for that yeah, that submit was with comment on fixed seed
 Zenoscave: wlesavo you're the boss?
 ssda: I never thought there were island like this -7897354049226771500
 rwilson: ssda that's the 2nd map i've seen with isolated sections of water
 rwilson: not sure if it happens enough to code something in your starting location selection...   maybe eulerscheZahl knows&#160;;) 
 struct: Its very rare
 ssda: I can figure it out.I just did not expect it. too much headache for small problem
 alchemsti: Yeah, the dealing with silence, and still trying to get information out, and updating that historical information when new stuff comes in ... that's what's been killing me the last while, and I think what I need to make legendary.
 ssda: I did that but I'm still silver
 Zenoscave: then you did it wrong
 ssda: no I'm sure I did it correctly 
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449318799">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449318799</a> amazing!
 Astrobytes: lol wtf you testing against me for, my bots fucked mate
 icecream17: well, i always timeouted against this other person, but now that i fixed that i timeout against you
 Astrobytes: Depends which version you tested against
 Zenoscave: probably state explosion icecream17 he silences the turn before you timeout
 RavenKZP: logic: code with some bugs in special cases -&gt; 40 in silverfix bugs -&gt; 167 in silver :D
 Zenoscave: put the bugs back&#160;;)
 ssda: Zenoscave I'm still figuring out the other stuff how to utilize them to the max + the best way to move around the map
 Zenoscave: floodfill and edge following is all I do rn
 RavenKZP: looks like bugs are somehow useful :D
 Nerchio: zenos what do you mean edge following?
 Nerchio: i am using floodfill but sometimes it cuts areas and i lose many moves
 Nerchio: would like to prolong my surface in certain times
 Zenoscave: if two paths are equally likely chose the one that has less moves next turn
 ssda: let me google that floodfill  alg of yours
 Zenoscave: it doesn't work perfect but it helps
 Nerchio: well so its the same as mine
 Nerchio: problem is
 icecream17: i use the squares next to the squares i could go to, but i flip N and E, and S and W, and I also check the diagonals to see if i can go N (which has 1 escape) but end up at E (which has 3 escape)... and.. oh wow that's really complicated
 Nerchio: in open water when you have lets say 150 squares W and 150 squares N
 Nerchio: but when you go north you blockade like 30 squares in the corner forever
 Nerchio: that sucks
 Nerchio: also where is my avatar
 Zenoscave: try maybe a higher depth dfs?
 AntiSquid: ssda there's a map with 4 big lakes and 1 tile lake in the middle, don't have the seed anymore
 icecream17: I wish the seed was more straightforward and that we could make any shape and size islands
 icecream17: I would make even second row land, but leave the middle column ocean
 icecream17: or maybe every prime would be land....
 ssda: AntiSquid ahh thanks for the head up. I will add to the to-do-list
 ssda: just want to check. is there a path I can take that will give less info about my location than another?
 ssda: I did focused only on the attack side
 icecream17: woah. i just had an idea for crystal rush - if you put a line of traps right next to the start.....
 Zenoscave: You have to sim your opponents possible paths for you as well
 Zenoscave: icecream17 that was done in the contest
 icecream17: my ideas are always taken by the past
 ssda: lol
 Zenoscave: doesn't make it any less of an idea
 alchemsti: @ssda, definitely you can choose paths that give less info
 ssda: damn I will add it to the think-list
 alchemsti: :D I have a long think list too. Well, long implementation list&#160;:/
 icecream17: My list right now is full of things that will take a week to implement.
 alchemsti: That is indeed the problem&#160;:/
 icecream17: Frame 47 win!? No -1!?
 icecream17: MINE S. Next turn: MOVE S. TRIGGER. Get torpedoed right on too.
 Nerchio: .
 icecream17: How to find a bug: Submit your code and ridiculous things happen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449344777">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/449344777</a>
 ssda: idk copy that guy to your IDE and rerun your code until it crash 
 ssda: need sleep see later guys
 alchemsti: I crash-failed like this when I sent the same command twice, or tried to do something else illegal. You may want to dump to your command to debug, before sending it to standard out -- I don't think you get to see bad commands via stdout
 icecream17: augh! stop being so random, other people
 alchemsti: I'm heading to bed too. Next time I think I will try to build replay capability in from the beginning. My stuff is too stateful&#160;:/
 Nerchio: there is a guy that doesn't care if you silenced
 Nerchio: he just shots the position assuming you did silence 0
 Nerchio: so annoying :p
 MostComplicatedUsername: icecream17 it look like you pause when placing a mine
 icecream17: yeah
 MostComplicatedUsername: 6 days left... still in wood 1

 icecream17: bronze
 MostComplicatedUsername: Um ok
 icecream17: good night. just discovered "back to the code". pretty cool

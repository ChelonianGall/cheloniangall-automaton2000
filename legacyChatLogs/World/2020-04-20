 jsprieto10: hi
 MadKnight: hey
 kovi: top5 is very close
 cegprakash: oh no: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453104282">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453104282</a>
 kovi: oh, nice swag!
 Swagboy: Thanks kovi!
 Swagboy: What I've been trying to do was almost too ambitious even for one month!
 kovi: did you set up an NN?
 Swagboy: No a partial information mcts
 Swagboy: I already have issues with the 100ko limit without a NN
 eulerscheZahl: you have a NN?
 Swagboy: No no
 kovi: wow, you have very nice stat vs. top
 Swagboy: Yes around 50% on good benchmarks
 Swagboy: But just had a 10+ loses row 
 dbdr: noise
 kovi: you may push joli to #1
 kovi: oh, you did cgbench?
 kovi: just scrolled up
 kovi: what was you winrate vs. me?
 eulerscheZahl: you submit too often to tell
 Swagboy: I usually bench around 50% against you kovi
 kovi: thx
 Swagboy: But since I reached the top 10 quite late, I've got many feature a bit untested
 Swagboy: First I think that my bot is still too aggressive
 metahom: omg, it seems like PonyCode has protection from being played in ide
 Swagboy: Hence maybe good winrate against strong bot but average winrate against average bots
 kovi: hmm, interesting point
 Swagboy: Most of my defeat I shoot first
 Quidome: he guys did you stay up all night?
 kovi: move shoot?
 kovi: that is a risky order
 Swagboy: Sometimes just shoot without silence
 eulerscheZahl: no Quidome, i'm the early bird
 Quidome: :D
 Swagboy: It's indeed risky, but the risk is somehow calculated by the mcts
 eulerscheZahl: this very code was at 23 1h ago, now i'm stuck around 50&#160;:/
 Swagboy: But what is underestimated is the loss of 3 charge points
 Quidome: last few hours, any interesting last time arrivals?
 eulerscheZahl: swag
 Swagboy: yes?
 eulerscheZahl: Quidome 07:12AMlast few hours, any interesting last time arrivals?
 Quidome: ah, yes top 5, nice work!
 Swagboy: Oh right
 Swagboy: thx Quidome!
 Quidome: and calculating...
 Quidome: Kovi at first positon while crunching, all interesting. Is there a life speaker :P
 kovi: not any more...
 Quidome: i just dropped out of the tp 10%&#160;:(
 Quidome: can't wait for the next one and it is comming soon. I think i go for Rust. Performance was killing me this contest
 eulerscheZahl: always depends on the game if you need the performance
 Swagboy: Which langage did you use?
 kovi: 4xpython in top10-20, it was not that crucial this time
 eulerscheZahl: code4life had lots of heuristics at the topmean max was a simulation festival
 Quidome: First Python, then switched to Java
 eulerscheZahl: java sounds fast enough
 Quidome: little bit unpredictable
 eulerscheZahl: garbage collection?
 Quidome: yep
 Quidome: but, I have to design for performance as well
 Quidome: Blaming Java is not right
 Quidome: But, it was great fun :D
 Quidome: Correctness is more important then anything
 Quidome: A stupid bot with good tracking is already in silver, maybe gold
 FrankR: Gold - says my stupid bot&#160;:)
 Nickname_Za007: Hello
 Nickname_Za007: I wonder why lately clash of code servers respond so slow
 Nickname_Za007: or its just my internet
 mlomb: its a contest
 mlomb: welcome to legend martin, are you the last one?
 thibpat: Hi :wave: I'm going to take a last try to improve my Ocean of Code before the end of the competition, live on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 Illedan: Writing new very untested features right now hoping they would work :scream:
 dbdr: same Illedan&#160;:)
 mlomb: will you finish the rewrite on time Illedan?
 dbdr: finishing a rewrite with a one hour deadline, that would be so stressful
 ZarthaxX: risky move Illedan
 dbdr: live dangerously
 Illedan: I have that up yesterday mlomb. Now I'm only adding ifs :P
 mlomb: nice then
 kovi: my ifs failed
 ZarthaxX: my life failed
 mlomb: the contest failed
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: Illedan he is kidding
 ZarthaxX: good contest&#160;:)
 dbdr: very interesting game
 mlomb: nah its good
 Illedan: \o/
 mlomb: I'm joing
 mlomb: joking*
 Illedan: A little too deep :P
 dbdr: brought something new in my opinion
 mlomb: I just feel too much randomness :P
 ZarthaxX: randomness? :P
 Illedan: Yeah, sadly too much randomness
 mlomb: maybe I'm just bad
 Illedan: Not sure what would have fixed it though
 Illedan: Visible enemy? :D
 dbdr: yes, uncertainty is fundamental to the game
 dbdr: that's what makes it interesting
 dbdr: but then you can get more or less lucky, and only many games will show the skill, when it is close
 dbdr: as always, of course
 Illedan: I can't decide on a number :scream:
 Illedan: 1 or 2?
 dbdr: 1.5?
 Illedan: Has to be whole
 dbdr: 1 + rand(2)
 Illedan: naaah
 Illedan: I need determinism :P
 Illedan: It's one of my most important numbers
 dbdr: what is it?
 Illedan: How much hp I have left to force a stupid move instead of surface :P
 dbdr: stupid move can cost you more than 1?
 Illedan: sure
 dbdr: then 1&#160;:)
 dbdr: wait, the other one&#160;;)
 pb4: reCurse  05H44I'll go with pb3 for the meme :D
 pb4: please no -_-
 Illedan: pb3?
 Illedan: 3rd place? :P
 struct: yes
 dbdr: Illedan <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&amp;min=1&amp;max=2&amp;col=1&amp;base=10&amp;format=html&amp;rnd=new">https://www.random.org/integers/?num=1&amp;min=1&amp;max=2&amp;col=1&amp;base=10&amp;format=html&amp;rnd=new</a>
 dbdr: will be deterministic once you see it
 Illedan: It is 2 now
 Illedan: and this thing is still climbing
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 dbdr: yes, doing well, don't touch it
 Illedan: Looks like new feature worked ok
 Illedan: sweeet
 Illedan: Or Im just lucky
 Illedan: and will be crushed down to &gt; 20
 Illedan: :scream:
 dbdr: come back in 5 hours to find out&#160;;)
 Illedan: 8 wins 1 lose vs blaster on this one. It's a winner.
 dbdr: cherry picking the opponent?&#160;;)
 Illedan: Picking the best stat in Cg.stats :D
 dbdr: I have 100% on kovi&#160;;)
 dbdr: spoke too soon :D
 Illedan: 100% vs jolindien :D
 dbdr: 67% vs Illedan&#160;;)
 Illedan: Let's not read tooooo much from these numbers
 dbdr: as long as it's for fun...
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: no time left for precise measurements now
 dbdr: your bot looks good at #6, leaving it there I guess?
 Illedan: Yes ofc
 Illedan: This is the highest I have been in very long
 dbdr: me too. good timing&#160;:)
 Illedan: But, there is a whole bunch in submit..
 Illedan: But you win too much vs me
 Illedan: :thinking:
 Nerchio: i can  keep submitting until the time runs out?
 dbdr: Nerchio yes
 Illedan: Sure
 ZarthaxX: didnt previous rank affect you on recalc?
 dbdr: the final rank of your last sumit is your starting rank for recalc
 Nerchio: ok give me a good run lets go :p
 tobk: hm, dropped from G50 to G90 over night&#160;:-(
 JFB: It looks that my bot is the_Gold_Boss_killer. Just run 6 runs in IDE - 6 wins. What the pity that my bot is stack in 70-80 gold range and can not play with Boss ...
 Nagatwin: recalc will take years haha
 Nerchio: :s
 anid: wd pb4, looks like ur win is assured
 mark7: and here I am stuck in silver
 dbdr: Illedan :O
 Illedan: :angel:
 dbdr: noob&#160;;)
 Illedan: hahaha
 Riyuk: :joy:
 Illedan: Just gonna test 2 different values for something
 anid: Illedan resubmit?
 MichaelPu: what happens if your bot is in the middle of re-ranking when the time ends?
 dbdr: the ranking continues
 Illedan: Everyone has to wait for it to finish
 Illedan: before rerun is done
 dbdr: only new submits are blocked
 MichaelPu: so the final results come only ~30 mins after the deadling?
 mlomb: ha ha
 Illedan: nah
 tobk: yes, back to G55, now stay there! good bot.
 Illedan: in 4 hours
 JFB: For legend even later
 dbdr: + several hours of recalc
 Illedan: All Legend players are given 1000 new matches
 MichaelPu: oww
 tobk: how was it? recalc is for max(legend, top100)?
 Illedan: *min
 tobk: okay, no guaranteed no recalc in gold and only top 100 of legend?
 JFB: yes
 MichaelPu: so no matter what place you are in legend, you will be re-calced anyway?
 tobk: do the top 100 then only play among themselves, or against all in legend (randomly), and can they drop below 100th rank?
 Illedan: Correct
 Illedan: Only vs legend players
 MichaelPu: sounds fair&#160;:)
 Illedan: and they can drop to the end of legend
 Illedan: If you suddenly lose all :P
 darkhorse64: Min your last minute submit
 darkhorse64: *Mind*
 MichaelPu: that actually changed my strategy a bit
 MichaelPu: I got 2 sets of parameters - 1 is good against ranks 10-30
 MichaelPu: and the other one against ranks 10-60
 Illedan: Adding a timer? :P
 dbdr: and not mess it up
 MichaelPu: no, just a slight change of parameters
 MichaelPu: it's crazy, 2% change in a parameter value can be the difference between 15th place and 30th place
 Illedan: euler submitted something new?
 dbdr: another noob
 tobk: some bots also print funny messages (do they still do that in legend?), you could change your strategy based on those
 tobk: one was singing the Portal song...
 JFB: Your bt do not see messages
 tobk: oh, you are right, I forgot
 Illedan: That would be wierd :P
 JFB: For example message of one bot for another: could you kill yourself, please?&#160;;-)
 Illedan: So you need to at AI to understand the message :P
 Illedan: And have a chat
 JFB: Next level of AI&#160;:-)
 WINWINWIN: Guys, for back to the code I shud use manhattan distance?
 Illedan: sure
 JFB: And AutomatonNN will win&#160;:-)
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem?
 Illedan: AutomatonNN can you SURFACE?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a problem with the statement
 JFB:&#160;:-D
 Illedan: haha
 mark7: Hope my current submit passes silver
 Illedan: My submit is winning its way back top 20 at least. Means it wasn't just luck :D
 dbdr: Illedan did you put back your previous one?
 Quidome: tik tak tik tak
 duckquackduck: thanks for the contest guys. it was fun! 
 Quidome: Yes it was!
 MichaelPu: sent a resubmit, turned off debugging&#160;:)
 wlesavo: happy new year
 MichaelPu: save some ms
 ZarthaxX: finally its ending
 ZarthaxX: D:
 Quidome: just entered the top 10%
 Quidome: me happy :D
 Swagboy:&#160;::)
 Nerchio:  i like that its ending i dont like that my submit is trash
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: rip tshirt?
 ZarthaxX: gg!
 Swagboy: 15 first tshirt&#160;?
 Nerchio: i cant be top 20 for sure :p
 mlomb: gg
 kovi: top5 is still balanced
 mark7: gg
 ZarthaxX: 20 Swagboy
 Illedan: gg
 Swagboy: nice
 mlomb: gg
 Quidome: We get a recalculation before we know the official winner?
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: Come back in about 4 hours&#160;:)
 Illedan: dbdr, this was my old yeah
 Quidome: aha
 ZarthaxX: Quidome not for whole leaderboard
 Swagboy: top 4 kovi
 Quidome: complete legen i hope
 kovi: truel, i cant tell where siman lands
 Swagboy: Oh right he may come
 Swagboy: Well played everyone, I'm going to bake a chocolate cake to celebrate
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885</a>
 AntiSquid: lol guess i got randomly dropped over night again
 AntiSquid: kinda lame considering it can go either way
 ZarthaxX: f squid
 AntiSquid: anyone got a link to the leaderboard please?
 metahom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global</a>
 AntiSquid: thanks
 AntiSquid: oh shit i am barely above that top typescript guy, hope i don't get dropped&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: have a long story to tell, will post feedback in few days probably
 ZarthaxX: long story?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 wlesavo: so its gonna be a full resubmit now?
 kovi: how many actual players?
 struct: legend
 Nagatwin: 2279 kovi
 ZarthaxX: structoooooooo
 kovi: thx
 AntiSquid: why is that a problem ZarthaxX&#160;?
 struct: hi ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: didnt say it was a problem
 ZarthaxX: hi tobo
 thanos.a: is there a way to change the default text when starting a clash of code&#160;?
 tobk: the code stubs?
 thanos.a: yap
 Quidome: 17 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes for the next one!
 AntiSquid: thanos should have used his glove to destroy clash of code instead
 thanos.a: marvel came after me ..
 dbdr: did Siman mess his bot? he's looking low at 50%
 thanos.a: my name was there years before them
 Illedan: Above dbdr :D Good plan to submit again
 Illedan: xD
 dbdr: not so noob after all
 Illedan: 12-6 is very close..
 dbdr: up to 5 even
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: kovi crush me, but I'm 50% vs ValGrowth
 CacheCoherence: Hey, how do I look at the question of a clash of code game once its done?
 kovi: i hope illedan stays high, he is good vs. pb4 as well
 dbdr: Illedan I have the opposite :D
 Illedan: :D
 pb4: Illedan get out of there&#160;!
 Illedan: that is 4 games vs pb4 :P
 pb4: that is 4 too many
 kovi: one can still hope. top4 alone i have the worse chance
 dbdr: why worse?
 kovi: (at least with latest runs winrates)
 kovi: if it will be top4 games only
 kovi: (would be)
 AntiSquid: that's why puzzles are better CacheCoherence
 Santyx_Orrer: will the contest go on as a competion? if so when?
 Illedan: It will become a multiplayer
 Illedan: Hopefully today, but I'm waiting the response from CG team.
 kovi: wow
 AntiSquid: the dream
 Santyx_Orrer: multiplayer in the sense you have more subs?
 Sissiimperatice: gg kovi&#160;;)
 Sissiimperatice: gg all
 AntiSquid: no
 Illedan: No Santyx_Orrer, only 1 sub. But you can find the game in the multiplayer section
 AntiSquid: it means you can play it after the contest
 Illedan: So that you can continue, except the contest part is done
 Santyx_Orrer: Illedan: thx
 CacheCoherence: Can anyone answer ^^^ 
 CacheCoherence: Oh so it isnt possible AntiSquid
 CacheCoherence:&#160;?
 JFB: Quidome - oficial for Legend - after recalculation. Official for other leagues - now
 AntiSquid: no CacheCoherence
 AntiSquid: do puzzles, start with easy ones
 CacheCoherence: Damn, 
 AntiSquid: or do multiplayer
 pb4: @byebye Illedan, not thank you for the 4 losses :rage:
 Illedan: :sob:
 AntiSquid: lol you don't know what recalc will do
 Illedan: Just wait for the rerun :evil:
 Illedan: Just wait for my lucky 20 first wins
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: pb gettin demolished in 3.
 kovi: it is also intertesting that makers can play, just not win(i lost some places on coif wiht bad winrate vs. azkellas)
 Illedan: I can win this one
 Illedan: (not with this code)
 Illedan: but in theory
 JFB: When OoC multi will start? Tomorrow?
 dbdr: Illedan be afraid, I have a good rate against you&#160;:)
 Illedan: I'll let you know as soon as CG responds to my question
 Illedan: shh dbdr, let me have hopes
 ZarthaxX: euler shark died already?
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: toad is back
 Illedan: Toad \o/
 dbdr: you go up and I feed off you, win-win
 JFB: long live toad&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: servers dying in 3...
 Illedan: :scream:
 JFB: Only 2,5 week for start of the new contest. My family will kill me ...
 Illedan: Tell them you need to isolate from Corona somewhere far away :P
 AntiSquid: no last minute troll submit wood to legend&#160;?
 AntiSquid: dissapointing
 Illedan: JFB, multi should be ready later today&#160;:)
 JFB: I'm working from home for last 5 weeks. Now I can tell that I have return to working from joffice (nobody in the office now)
 JFB: Thanks Illedan
 JFB:&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: oh wow they lifted lockdown in poland?
 JFB: Not 
 AntiSquid: i missunderstood then, when do you return to your office
 JFB: It is not prohibited to work in the office. 
 AntiSquid: well here they try to minimize movement
 JFB: Becouse in this moment in my job nobody in the office - I can be only one on the floor of the building&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: do you like it that way?
 NormantasStankevicius: okay, the competition has ended, is there a place to see the final leaderboards?
 ZarthaxX: NormantasStankevicius it wasnt computed yet
 JFB: I'm working by remote desctop. By one of the probrams I use need to be started from the keyboard - so I can yose it remotelly but to start it 1st time I have to log on on the keyboard in the office.It is strange 
 NormantasStankevicius: Also, as my first proper competition, I'm kinda happy placing low gold. Tho took too much time to get there, was great to learn some new algorithms, that I could use in graphical issues or just 2d grids... this was a fun, yet emotionally and in general hard run
 NormantasStankevicius: ok ZarthaxX, will be waiting, I was competing for my school ratings, cause my teacher asked me to help, curious how the final placements end
 JFB: NormantasStankevicius - Gold rating is now final. Only final results on Legend will be after few hours
 ZarthaxX: NormantasStankevicius ah i see, gz dude
 AntiSquid: NormantasStankevicius <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=ALL">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=ALL</a> well apart from legend it's all part of the final leaderboard
 JFB: NormantasStankevicius - so it looks that your school is #19/34 and you are #2 in your school.&#160;:-) 
 Illedan: Rerun :scream:
 wlesavo: dam, being on the edge of top 20 is stressful
 dbdr: Illedan you'll get demoted to gold at this rate
 Illedan: dbdr grrr
 Illedan: Damn you are eating my score
 dbdr: wlesavo good luck! you deserve top 20 for sure!
 Illedan: :wave: top 10 hopes
 wlesavo: dbdr i hope youll make it to top 10 :slight_smile:
 Illedan: I hope Rust stops working very soon now
 dbdr: thanks! would be nice, but I already have that achivement, so no big stress
 dbdr: and top 3 is out of reach
 VincentBab: top20&#160;!! let's hope
 dbdr: Illedan :rage:
 dbdr: 10% already, going pretty fast
 wlesavo: im also eating illedans points a little
 AntiSquid: Val is doing very well
 TimAI: hey guys, is it cheat from toad&#160;? ))
 TimAI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/453207551">https://www.codingame.com/replay/453207551</a>
 Illedan: Nah
 dbdr: why would it be cheat?
 TimAI: only trigger, is it ok?
 Illedan: sure
 dbdr: sure
 Illedan: I forgot to implement it though
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 dbdr: 1 action per turn min
 TimAI: wow, ok, thanks
 Nerchio: 37 feelsbad&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: obvious hax from toad /s
 gkcs: Wow, that was a fun contest!
 dbdr: wlesavo staying stable?
 anid: Are the last submits being evaluated rn?
 wlesavo: dbdr yeah, seems like i will get my tshirt :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: wow, top 4 is so close
 wlesavo: with jolindien taking lead
 Illedan: I'm free falling&#160;:(
 struct: Top 3 so close to each other
 wlesavo: did not think it would be that close, 0.1 difference
 MSmits: I've been less than 0.01 above the nr 5 one time, difference wasnt visibile
 kovi: top4, not top3
 wlesavo: Illedan mars landing
 wlesavo: but im feeling for you
 MSmits: leaderboard is so random though...
 MSmits: the differences between the players so small
 dbdr: top 4 seems clear
 MSmits: you mean compared to the rest
 MSmits: thats not my definition of clear, they are close to eachother... very
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: I'd like to have clarity inside the top 4&#160;:/
 dbdr: yeah...
 pb4: I'd like it even more if clarity was in my favor :D
 dbdr: breathe&#160;;)
 struct: rererun top 4
 MSmits: struct they won't 
 struct: I know
 MSmits: the main problem is not the system here and a rerun would not solve anything
 AntiSquid: 1 point difference isn't small
 wlesavo: benchmark top 4
 MSmits: the problem is that the bots are too close together and there will never be a clear result
 MSmits: because it depends on rock paper scissors also
 wlesavo: till you satisfied with results pb4
 MSmits: if you add in player nr 5 to the rerun, the end result for player 1 is different maybe
 struct: My bet is still on pb
 MSmits: and if you add in player 6... it would be different again
 MSmits: bots can simply be too close to call a clear winner and there's nothing you can do
 MSmits: but pray to rng gods
 pb4: That's what I do...
 struct: From my calculations
 struct: you get 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th place
 MSmits: gj on those calcs struct
 wlesavo: 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th in the same time
 Illedan: Seems I managed to stabilize when out of dbdr's range :phew:
 struct: What if they all end up with same points
 struct: I didnt take this into account
 RoboStac: the
 dbdr: Illedan maybe I don't play against you anymore, but you should
 dbdr: so only half
 RoboStac: they're much more precise on the server 
 RoboStac: so I'd imagine it's just sorted by that
 RoboStac: though at that point pretty much any order is valid
 struct: I see
 dbdr: clue TGD&#160;;)
 RoboStac: as it basically means they're the same strength
 wlesavo: even reverse
 Illedan: They seem to move consistently now though
 struct: So its just not 2 decimals
 wlesavo: wow, kovi droped to 3 even
 JFB: 0.12 diff #1 - #4
 MSmits: Euler and I are 0.07 
 MSmits: much more interesting than top 4 imho :P
 eulerscheZahl: i used to be 21st when the rerun started&#160;:/
 Illedan: I was 10th :P
 eulerscheZahl: but maybe i'll pass Illedan at least :D
 MSmits: yeah  I saw
 Illedan: then dbdr kicked me out
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/AWLg54.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/AWLg54.jpg</a>
 dbdr: lb before rerun
 Illedan: :sob: all my hopes :boom:
 JFB: MSmits - #20 - #21 is much more interesting imo&#160;;-)
 MSmits: lol ok
 MSmits: 0.03....
 MSmits: 0.02 now
 JFB: Exactly&#160;:-)
 MSmits: i am talking about me and Euler still :P
 dbdr: surely would be first for VincentBab
 AntiSquid: the french flag all over the place
 JFB: Not in school leaderboard&#160;;-)
 AntiSquid: hard to take the 2 new categories seriously when so many companies/schools are automatically excluded
 wlesavo: wow, but whole top 10 in companies
 MSmits: makes total sense
 JFB: excluded?
 AntiSquid: i mean some people could solo climb on those 2 leaderboards
 MSmits: CG is used as a recruiting tool for French companies mostly
 MSmits: would not expect anything else
 AntiSquid: what does that have to do with recruitment?
 JFB: pb4 - #1 now
 AntiSquid: if anything it works against them
 dbdr: hugary and japan are resisting to the french domination
 MSmits: because if there is a business relationship dont you think many players here would work in that company?
 MSmits: and be on that team?
 N8_Name: baaa
 MSmits: over 25 people from Thales and amadeus
 MSmits: which are the two companies that had the most contests on CG
 struct: amadeus sponsored UTG
 AntiSquid: that still doesn't make any sense, there could be a company with no relation to CG and top that leaderboard, what does that have to do with anything?
 dbdr: cause or consequence?
 N8_Name: @SanduCristi
 SanduCristi: @N8_Name
 SanduCristi:&#160;:))
 N8_Name:&#160;:))
 MSmits: AntiSquid visibility
 AntiSquid: and the polish university only advertises itself being there first
 AntiSquid: but you don't need a relation with CG for visibility
 AntiSquid: and if someone can solo the leaderboard they get visibility too 
 AntiSquid: it's probably to prevent the new categories to look to much like the solo ladder, but again it doesn't mean much the way it is now
 MSmits: well i dont know how to explain my thinking any other way. If a company sponsors contests, draws good CG players into their employ, then motivates their employees to join CG contests to make the company visible
 MSmits: ...
 MSmits: it makes no sense for a German company to do this, because CG is not very visible to Germany
 MSmits: it's not their market
 AntiSquid: but as i said the wroclaw uni self-promotes well, i guess i would try there if i was going to uni and wouldn't mind the country&#160;? eh&#160;? looks more fun
 MSmits: uni&#160;!= company
 AntiSquid: was talking about the 2 categories though
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: yeah I could promote CG on my school, but i dont think many are good enough to get anywhere
 MSmits: i might pass the 3 player mark though and get it on there
 AntiSquid: it makes the school appear more appealing/fun
 MSmits: yeah 
 aCat: I'd love that some people see it as promotion&#160;;-)
 AntiSquid: ya i get what you are saying, but any other company can come and wreck the top, even without motivation to recruit people
 AntiSquid: just casually
 MSmits: true
 Nerchio: aCat so you're a teacher not a student?
 aCat: yep
 AntiSquid: yes
 Nerchio: you were better than your students then :joy:
 AntiSquid: switch university Nerchio
 AntiSquid: and tell your teachers to come beat acat in next contest
 Nerchio: in my uni i have to learn Ocaml, my next bot in ocaml maybe? xD
 AntiSquid: why ocaml&#160;?
 Nerchio: idk
 Nerchio: dont ask me
 AntiSquid: do they also ask you to learn java and typescript?
 Nerchio: so far we usually write in C xd
 RoboStac: I'm guessing it's to teach functional programming?
 Nerchio: i dont mind any language but i hate functional languages to be honest
 Nerchio: i look at ocaml and i dont get it xD
 Nerchio: i think my bot could've ended a couple spots higher but unlucky last submit
 wlesavo: kovi droped from top 3 :worried:
 Nerchio: they're all like 0.03 points apart though
 wlesavo: i think top 4 actually now in reverse order from before the recalc
 Illedan: Less and less about luck
 lxnn: At my uni the first programming course was taught in Haskell :sweat_smile:
 lxnn: I think using functional programming for CS education started in the days of lisp/scheme
 lxnn: Definitely good languages for AI programming, but difficult to master well enough to really optimise your code
 pb4: "wlesavo 12H12i think top 4 actually now in reverse order from before the recalc"
 pb4: Let me correct that
 pb4: "i think top 4 actually in correct order now"
 Illedan: Jinx!
 JFB:&#160;:-D
 wlesavo: pb4 :grinning:
 JFB: pb4 - you have to add " ... and one of my most important advantages is modesty ..."&#160;;-)
 PerpetualTopHat_435a: hi
 JFB: MSmits - it looks that you win your small but maybe the most important victory (over euler )&#160;:-)
 metahom: eulerscheZahl, Illedan, CG team, thanks for contest! 
 JFB: Nerchio - if your bot was in OCaml - you will be #1 in this language 
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-feedback-strategies/175885</a>
 pb4: JFB :D
 AntiSquid: pb4 so what were you using for your bot that required more than 100kb space?
 JFB: kovi - I think that you resubmit semi automatically to generate a lot of matches to use it for train NN or optimise parameters locally (using logs). Is it true or it is only my "conspiracy theory"&#160;?
 kovi: nope, i just used it as the only method of assessing improvement
 JFB: OK. So it is only my "dirty mind"&#160;:-)
 MSmits: JFB I was mostly kidding though, I have no rivalry with euler on contests. I like it when he beats me and especially that he is nr 1 overall. It's more jokingly
 JFB:  :-) MSmits - I know, it is only my kind if joke (stupid one). I think that it was too long contest for eulerscheZahl . Any way - thank eulerscheZahl, Illedan and G-rom for the contest!!! (And to CG and all its stuff too - of course - bid thank you!!!)
 MSmits: yes thanks guys, good job
 Illedan: Was fun. Thx for playing :rocket:
 MSmits: as a long contest it was definitely more succesful than locam. Though both individual games have their charm. This one was better for a month
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, see you for pacman soon
 eulerscheZahl: to finally beat you MSmits :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: (just kidding)
 MSmits: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: stats are on the forum btw
 AntiSquid: giving like for pretty graphics
 JFB: When I hear "Pacman" - first I see this scene from Guardian of the Galaxy 2nd&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo holy wall of text :o
 wlesavo: lul
 Illedan: Nice stats euler
 wlesavo: i used to writing papers, you know
 AntiSquid: just a few paragraphis, papers are longer no? :P
 AntiSquid: but thanks for PM
 Nerchio: euler your stats are interesting
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl thx for a stat, really nice one
 Nerchio: look at dmg taken by mine 1st and 2nd player
 Nerchio: such a clear difference
 Illedan: But joli deals more dmg
 eulerscheZahl: but at the cost of more surfacing
 eulerscheZahl: avoid mine by surface. not sure what is better :P
 jolindien: thanks eulerscheZahl, Illedan, G-rom&#160;!
 jolindien: great game&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: well played jolindien
 jolindien: thx&#160;!
 MSmits: yes well done
 MSmits: should I write a long PM on this one?
 MSmits: not sure if i did anything special
 eulerscheZahl: fun fact: only 2 players in legend didn't crash a single time
 Illedan: :D
 wlesavo: lol
 MSmits: lol
 wlesavo: wow, im one of them
 Cappefra: is there a way to see how many times I crashed?
 cegprakash: just woke up
 cegprakash: what did I miss
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl got top 20?
 cegprakash: leaderboard link plz
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=legend">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global?column=LEAGUE&amp;value=legend</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Cappefra only if you download every single one of your games
 eulerscheZahl: i just downloaded 45k and feel guilty now
 Cappefra: oh ok, thanks not gonna do it haha
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl there is a typo Turns ger game
 cegprakash: aw 28th
 Astrobytes: wow, pretty close at the top!
 cegprakash: yes all legend have very nice score
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo what's wrong?
 Astrobytes: Did you get gold eventually cegprakash?
 cegprakash: my bot would have may be 1.44 score in legend
 cegprakash: Astrobytes no I had a working simu though
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl should not it be per game?
 cegprakash: which was 50 ranks lower than my non-simu bot
 eulerscheZahl: i'm blind!
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global?column=keyword&amp;value=ceg">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code/leaderboard/global?column=keyword&amp;value=ceg</a> Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: cegprakash Nice, improve it in multiplayer?
 cegprakash: is it open yet?
 AntiSquid: later
 AntiSquid: today
 Cappefra: @wleslavo no, it means Turns GERMAN game
 cegprakash: wow
 cegprakash: today means I'll surely do
 cegprakash: if they delay I'll forget my progress
 eulerscheZahl: will fix it when i upload the final stats with all games played, thanks
 cegprakash: 818/2279 for last 3 days participation is not bad I feel
 cegprakash: If I had done for a week definitely gold
 cegprakash: unleash the geek is renamed to what game
 cegprakash: anyone remember?
 eulerscheZahl: crystal rush
 cegprakash: thanks
 cegprakash: i feel UTG easier version of Ocean of Code
 cegprakash: UTG needed less enemy tracking
 AntiSquid: i agree
 Radewoosh: WTF
 Radewoosh: How to get to ocean of code's IDE?
 cegprakash: Ocean of Code is all about tracking
 cegprakash: Radewoosh can't now
 AntiSquid: contest is over Radewoosh
 Radewoosh: wut
 Radewoosh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/">https://clist.by/</a>
 AntiSquid: you can maybe play it later today
 Radewoosh: clist says it's still running
 AntiSquid: when it turns into multi
 RoboStac: nah, it ended 3 hours ago
 AntiSquid: wow ... that annoying missinfo
 Radewoosh: Mah
 AntiSquid: did you have another version you wanted to submit?
 Radewoosh: I've left some autistic version
 Radewoosh: And wanted to submit some normal one xd
 Radewoosh: Or even work more on it
 Radewoosh: now
 Radewoosh: I've expected these extra 5 hours
 AntiSquid: can still participate in the multi
 Radewoosh: multi?
 struct: It will become a multi
 AntiSquid: yes, all contests become multiplayers
 struct: So you can play it longer
 AntiSquid: so you can play it forever, until the end of time
 Radewoosh: What will be the difference?
 Radewoosh: Between then and now
 MSmits: no time limit
 Radewoosh: What has ended actually?
 RoboStac: chance for prizes
 MSmits: the contest with prizes
 cegprakash: anyone wants to see my Silver code? 
 AntiSquid: not much, all bots will automatically be submitted to multi
 AntiSquid: no
 Radewoosh: Meh, losing a chance for prizes also hurts
 MSmits: cegprakash dont share code
 MSmits: unless its a small piece
 cegprakash: in PM I mean
 cegprakash: I need improvement
 cegprakash: help
 cegprakash: or wait
 MSmits: if you think you did something worth sharing in PM, you should do it
 AntiSquid: i think it would be frowned upon, but most people won't care since it's silver
 cegprakash: I can look at the postmortem
 MSmits: no need to paste code in a PM though
 MSmits: the ideas are worth more and it is more fun to translate an idea into code than to copy someone elses code
 cegprakash: only 10 post mortems so far?
 cegprakash: I'll write one
 MSmits: there will be more
 cegprakash: my wood postmortem is amazing 
 AntiSquid: i only see 3 post morterms and one really cool animation
 AntiSquid: how do you count 10&#160;?
 cegprakash: total comments
 _Royale: just saw your PM eulerscheZahl, I like the gameplay statistics
 MSmits: can someone link the PM thread again
 eulerscheZahl: thanks _Royalehelped tuning my bot a bit (more surface, less mine damage)

 MSmits: thanks
 AntiSquid: 10 £ MSmits
 dbdr: wlesavo, grats on top 20!
 struct: grats pb
 wlesavo: dbdr thx, grats on top 10  :slight_smile:
 dbdr: thanks
 dbdr: even 1 digit&#160;:)
 wlesavo: hehe
 metahom: could somebody PM me when multi is open please. want to check one thing
 jolindien: you will receive a mail from CG
 metahom: oh, thanks
 MSmits: this is gonna be a huge PM&#160;:(
 MSmits: so much typing
 eulerscheZahl: do it like me: generate your PM with code
 wlesavo: MSmits longer then the actual code? :slight_smile:
 MSmits: yeah your pm is great&#160;:)
 MSmits: wlesavo maybe as many characters :0
 MSmits: hey eulerscheZahl, your stats say my mine avoidance was very good!
 eulerscheZahl: give me a second to update with all the games
 eulerscheZahl: takes a minute to generate with so many matches
 sharkdog: Is there any way draw/paint on the screen?
 AntiSquid: another multi!!!!
 MSmits: tulips and daisies?
 AntiSquid: oh nvm
 AntiSquid: mistook rock paper scissors for a multi
 AntiSquid: wonder why we don't have the old RPS game anymore
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl ur animation shows probabilities.. I only have 1 or 0
 cegprakash: what are these probabilities
 eulerscheZahl: different paths cause different mine placements
 MSmits: this is also a major problem with pruning
 cegprakash: these are mine probabilities?
 eulerscheZahl: as my opponent tracking gets more accurate, these numbers are changing
 cegprakash: I only track enemy movements not mines
 cegprakash: do I get probabilities as well
 eulerscheZahl: each path has a list of cells with mine drops
 cegprakash: for now all I have is 0 or 1
 Re9iNee: guys im still working on ocean of code though its finished, will it be available later? 
 eulerscheZahl: exclude paths =&gt; exclude mine locations
 AntiSquid: why did you join so late cegprakash?
 eulerscheZahl: later today Re9iNee
 cegprakash: was playing Age of empires AntiSquid
 Re9iNee: @eulerscheZahl ok thanks :X
 cegprakash: I didn't get motivation until I got my friend into this the last 3 days
 AntiSquid: then you maybe had more fun than me
 cegprakash: he tells strat and I code thigns
 cegprakash: he doesn't know to code
 cegprakash: he plays games though
 cegprakash: he might learn coding as I go him into this
 cegprakash: he's a manager now at Paypal
 kovi: gratz for top3!
 WINWINWIN: Congrats to top20 for their consistent performances
 WINWINWIN: esp PB4
 Uljahn: eulerscheZahl: what does "Spawn from center" mean on your stats page?
 eulerscheZahl: if you always spawn on (7,7), the value will be 0
 eulerscheZahl: if you spawn in the corner, it's sqrt(7^2+7^2)
 Uljahn: so it's euclidean distance?
 Uljahn: thx
 eulerscheZahl: yes, pythagorean
 eulerscheZahl: no manhattan
 MSmits: ahh turns out the PM is not that huge. 
 MSmits: has a lot of information I think people can use if they come to this multi later or want to improve
 darkhorse64: When I read what the tops post in the chat, I feel very humble despite (barely) making it in the top 50. There is an ocean between me and them  :smile:
 MSmits: what kind of things do you mean?
 darkhorse64: the way they choose moves
 MSmits: how did you choose moves?
 wlesavo: MSmits nice PM covers most of basics in a good details
 MSmits: yeah I was in doubt whether to post since there are 24 players above me, but I tend to write PM's that have more basics like that to help lower players, wheras most top players will just share their unique tricks
 darkhorse64: Can I do damage, make the most damage to him and least to me combining move and silence otherwose move to maximise space  and minimize detections and avoid ines
 MSmits: but thats pretty advanced?
 MSmits: i guess the details matter
 darkhorse64: One thing I never solved is how to avoid retaliation
 MSmits: me neither
 MSmits: thats  a top 10 thing
 MSmits: it's just difficult to make a bot work with so many moving parts
 MSmits: blasterpoard described it well last night
 darkhorse64: I also realized the last day that my shooting was not optimal (no kill moves)
 MSmits: you mean no fatality check?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: ahh ok, yeah that is a thing that helped me get out of gold
 MSmits: that and self tracking
 MSmits: I liked it a lot, because there is no doubt in writing that. Only one way to do it right
 MSmits: as opposed to the rest of the bot logic
 wlesavo: yeah, also liked a blasterpoard's insight, waiting for PM from him
 darkhorse64: I tried to do it yesterday but my brain did not comply. My self tracking is OK. I ran it against the top guys
 wlesavo: MSmits also it cant harm the bot, opposed to parameter tuning and stuff like that
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: my fatality code is 300 lines btw, so no small thing
 MSmits: took me a few hours
 MSmits: void FatalityRecursive(vector&lt;Order&gt;&amp; orders, uint64_t damage[], int myHealth, bool surfaced, bool moved, bool silenced, bool triggered, bool torpedoed, int x, int y, uint16_t blocked[], bool charged)
 MSmits: recursively try all moves
 wlesavo: lol
 MSmits: I keep a damage map as i go down and I only succeed if all possible opponent locations have equal or higher damage than the opponent lift
 MSmits: life
 iFightLegends: They should make the leaderboard filters combinable - like all C++ in Country X, every time I select a different filter, the old one resets...Or is this a browser specific thing?
 MSmits: nah i think it does reset
 Nerchio: Msmits I assume the opponent can start on any cell, meaning I start with 225 possible states for tracking.
 Nerchio: you dont exclude islands? ;d
 iFightLegends: :frowning2:
 MSmits: no I do lol
 darkhorse64: My usual game has been, shoot the cloud, inflict one damage, get two, and end the game with one life for the opponent and my torpedo about to inflict the fatal blow
 MSmits: yep, a lot of games were like that fo rme as well
 MSmits: i lose torpedo shootouts
 MSmits: the assumption of 0-silence might have helped me here
 darkhorse64: I'll read the PMs later but that's the problem I have been unable to solve
 MSmits: because then you can one-shot them for 2 damage
 wlesavo: darkhorse64 this is why i tried to make my matches longer, not very succesfully though judging by eulers stats
 darkhorse64: My last try has been 1 silence for me but it fails
 MSmits: you mean move 1&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Yes treat silence as a move (quick and dirty hack)
 MSmits: I meant what wlesavo explained. Most players will 0-silence, which means you play the game and try to determine whether that is the case for the current game. Then if it is the case, you filter all states that dont comply
 MSmits: then you just do 2 dmg per shot
 MSmits: because you know exactly where they are
 MSmits: i wish I had thought of that
 MSmits: it's so easy to code
 MSmits: just make a boolean per state for  non-zero silences
 darkhorse64: Pb4 had 2 trackers, one with assumptions, one without
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: none of that is hard to code, it just makes your code more of a mess
 wlesavo: i basically have weigths, and when i didnt need them just counted a possitions
 pb4: MSmits&#160;: this is where I'm glad I used C++
 darkhorse64: In this respect, one month time allowed me to keep my code clean
 MSmits: well not to avoid a mess surely.... I guess for performance reasons
 pb4: It was a mess, but if you allow copies everywhere it's still manageable to read your code
 pb4: I traded some readability for performance
 pb4: (more readable, less perf)
 MSmits: ah ok
 darkhorse64: like bitboards&#160;?
 pb4: I'm speaking about the tracker here
 pb4: bitboards are unreadable, but they're wrapped in neat functions so it doesn't matter
 lxnn: I was wondering, did anyone try to use a histogram filter for tracking in ooc. I was going to try it but didn't have time. I had a hard time getting the tracking algorithm I used to work well enough.
 darkhorse64: My tracker is based on unordered_set
 pb4: bitBoard.expandPlus(), expandSquare(), etc...
 jacek: happy 420 day
 MSmits: i used unordered map to prune states, but other than that it's a big object pool of State objects
 MSmits: (prune for chain-silence)
 MSmits: hi jacek
 MSmits: lxnn I am not sure what a histogram filter is
 lxnn: So, for each possible position of the opponent, you keep track of the probability that they are at that position (just a matrix of numbers between 0 and 1)
 MSmits: I do that yes
 MSmits: float[225]
 lxnn: When the opponent makes a movement, you update the probabilities by shifting them over
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i recalculate probabilities completely anew every turn
 MSmits: i keep possible states for the opponent and update those every turn
 lxnn: when they use silence, you model their movement as a uniformly random choice and update the probabilities accordingly
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: basically it's like this
 MSmits: you start with about 200 possible states
 lxnn: Then for any other information you multiply in a likelihood function
 lxnn: Sorry, can't type fast enough!
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: it's not what I did I mean
 MSmits: I understand what you mean now by histogram
 MSmits: it's not the way to go though
 MSmits: you need to keep the full state
 MSmits: not just the probabilities
 MSmits: there is way more information in the states
 MSmits: like, where has the sub been, from where did he lay mines?
 MSmits: just a single probability wont cut it
 lxnn: Yeah, I realised mine tracking wouldn't work as the size of the probability space would be enormous
 Nerchio: This is why I wish i started with a Point object would enable me to store much more information about single point in a nice manner
 Nerchio: instead i had like 10 arrays [15][15] xD
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3b6a116-6b44-4a88-a5ae-eec06168d09f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a3b6a116-6b44-4a88-a5ae-eec06168d09f</a>
 MSmits: basically an opponent state means a single current position (x,y)
 MSmits: all the places he has visited in a bitboard
 MSmits: and all the places he laid mines from
 MSmits: also in a sort of bitboard, but 4 bits per cell
 Nerchio: makes sense
 Nerchio: i did some string manipulation and a hashmap xD
 lxnn: Cool
 MSmits: it's amazing you did that well with that, other parts of your bot must be really good Nerchio
 Nerchio: no its bad i think
 Nerchio: but the mine tracking was
 lxnn: Would have tried something like that but I think a bit board in Python would be complicated
 MSmits: very
 Nerchio: mines
 lxnn: and probably not efficient enough
 lxnn: How large did the number of possible states grow during a match?
 MSmits: bitboard in python: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://repl.it/@msmits/Tic-Tac-Toe">https://repl.it/@msmits/Tic-Tac-Toe</a>
 MSmits: might not run in some browsers
 Nerchio: oooh
 Nerchio: Msmits
 Nerchio: i just understood your probability mine map
 Nerchio: i just had a list of mines from all states and tried to avoid it
 lxnn: ah thanks MSmits, I'll have a look
 Nerchio: but obviously it got big really quick
 Nerchio: instead i could've done it like you and get&#160;% of mine in spot XY
 MSmits: oh, i dont avoid low probability cells, if there is just 1 state where a mine was laid somewhere and 10k where it wasnt, i am not afraid of that cell
 Nerchio: true 
 Nerchio: thats good
 Nerchio: its funny
 Nerchio: stages you go through in a challenge
 Nerchio: at certain points you think you have a lot
 Nerchio: but then you realise how much you can still do
 lxnn: With the state tracking, did you keep count of the number of each state, or just keep a set of states?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: each state should be unique, but some rare cases there could be identical ones
 MSmits: I don't check for equal states every turn, that would be super expensive
 MSmits: in a regular game with not too many silences, i would have maybe 1k states at a time
 MSmits: with crazy silencing that can be 40k or so
 lxnn: I'm thinking that techinically, the proabilities aren't accurate if there are uncounted duplicates, but with the mine tracking the states are probaly sparse enough that this isn't a problem
 Nagatwin: MSmits actually its not that expensive and quite useful against silence spammers
 MSmits: even with mines?
 MSmits: i am assuming silence + mines
 MSmits: chain silence with no mines doesnt really happen
 accorp: saw a bot that doesn't do anything else ut silence...
 MSmits: not in legend I think
 MSmits: dont think you can promote to legend witha silence-bot
 accorp: of course not, that would be embarassing&#160;:)
 MSmits: heh right
 Nagatwin: MSmits 2 silence back to back is common and may compensate
 Nagatwin: Against kovi I could achieve 70% less paths than he had on his silence spamming version
 Nerchio: so Msmits how do you organize a scoring mechanism i guess this is somehow a way to avoid if-nightmare
 Nagatwin: and performance-wise, its all about using a set or a sorted array
 MSmits: ah ok Nagatwin, I could have been a bit more creative in that regard I guess. I did use sets/maps for prunign when the states got outof hand
 lxnn: I wish I'd started on OOC sooner, it was actually quite an interesting game, being deterministic but partially-observable
 MSmits: Nerchio I had separate scores
 MSmits: torpedo score, trigger score. The beamsearch scoring was messy 
 MSmits: the decisions were mostly not interdependent either, so it did not get too complicated. But this part was the weak part of my bot so...
 Nerchio: kk :D
 Nerchio: interesting post by wala, at least for me about Java
 lxnn: If you're interested, there's a section of Rusell and Norvig where they talk about Kriegspiel, which is partially-observable chess.
 Nerchio: he did it similar to me so instead of an object he went with a lot of arrays
 wala: thanks
 MSmits: lxnn someone mentioned that before i think
 Nerchio: because objects with java suck apparently?
 MSmits: sounds interestiing
 lxnn: Ah right
 MSmits: Nerchio did you use an object pool?
 Nerchio: opponent states were objects
 Nerchio: but everything else was not
 MSmits: what i mean is
 MSmits: did you create all required objects in the first 1s of the game
 Nerchio: no they were created during silence mostly
 MSmits: thats what I do
 MSmits: thats not good, because you need garbage collection then
 Nerchio: so its better to create objects in first turn and then just copy data to them u think?
 MSmits: try to avoid garbage collection by creating a massive array of objects and when you need a new object just index them in your massive array
 MSmits: then they dont need to be created or cleaned up
 Nerchio: sounds like another layer of complication :p
 MSmits: all my bots do this. In uttt I have 700 mb of treenodes
 MSmits: the memory is filled before turn 1&#160;:)
 MSmits: well no
 MSmits: it is reserved
 Nagatwin: MSmits if you don't wanna be creative you can do&#160;:for (i = 0; i&lt;n; i++)for (j = 0; j&lt;n; j++) if (states[i] == states[j]){	// remove states[j]}
 MSmits: uninitialized
 darren4494: hello world, which game are you discussing about?
 MSmits: Nagatwin that seemed expensive to me
 MSmits: contest that just ended darren4494
 Nagatwin: MSmits this is n^2 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: sometimes you coul dhave 40k states&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: sorting + erasing or hashmap is nlogn
 MSmits: right
 Nerchio: aren't duplicate states somehow useful?
 Nagatwin: MSmits I never reach 40k with such pruning
 Nerchio: it means he is more likely to be in that positions isnt it
 MSmits: I did on full chain-silence Nagatwin
 MSmits: with no mines
 Nagatwin: MSmits on full chain silence, that's what generates most dupes
 MSmits: Nerchio yeah... thats true, but it's a grey area
 MSmits: Nagatwin you're completely right.... the silly thing is, I did think of it, but dismissed it before trying,because most of my experience with transpositions is that it doesnt do much. It's different here apparently
 Nagatwin: Nerchio depends. The likelihood is more probably caused by the paths themselves (going into mines, etc..) rather than the amount of paths that goes to a given point
 Nagatwin: MSmits yeah agreed
 MSmits: also Nerchio, if you really wanted to, you could add a state-counter to a state and count duplicates when you remove them
 darren4494: Just curious, How much time did you spend on the contest, anyone?
 Nerchio: i probably like 80 hours if i had to guess :P
 MSmits: 1 week spread out over the month
 MSmits: 50-60 hrs if i dont count time spent chatting
 darren4494: ohhhhhh
 Nagatwin: yeah same, too much haha
 cegprakash: i forgot to add fatality in my eval
 cegprakash: if enemylife = 0 score = INF that's all I had to do
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: or score += INF/2
 lxnn: Nerchio, I think you're right about duplicate states, but I think that once include mine location and the path history in the state, duplicates would be rare enough not to distort the model significantly
 MSmits: its not about distortion I guess. It's about not getting overwhelmed in terms of calculation time required
 lxnn: Although  I don't have code available to test this notion hypothesis
 lxnn: *hypothesis
 wlesavo: last chance to beat pb4 before he updated his code on contrib page
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: hey, i found the trick to beating pb 4 last night, you just follow him until he goes into a corner and then seal him off with mines
 MSmits: works 1% of the time.... guaranteed
 Scarfield: 60% of the time, it works every time
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:)
 wlesavo: easiest top 1 of my life
 MSmits: gj
 wlesavo: where is your top 1 now pb4 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/o7bD317">https://imgur.com/o7bD317</a>
 eulerscheZahl: top10 \o/
 wlesavo: solid lead by 5 points
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl still #2 in C# though :wink:
 Nerchio: i need to learn more alghorithms haha
 Nerchio: dont know whats minmax or beamsearch
 MSmits: beamsearch is easy to understand. You just take a bunch of states, then make new states from them by applying moves. If you have more than a certain amount (the BeamWidth) then you sort by score and only keep the best x = beamwidth number of states
 MSmits: that way you can get very deep
 Nerchio: ok sounds simple
 MSmits: minimax is also not very hard. You can find much info about it 
 Nerchio: and a sim that some people were talking about is a simulation of the future yeah?
 Nerchio: xD
 MSmits: ab pruning is a bit harder to grasp, but only a few lines extra code
 Scarfield: MiniMax is basicly looking through possible choices/actions, simulate them to some depth, eval resulting state, choose current action to minimize opponents maximum score
 MSmits: sim is a simulation of the future yes
 MSmits: a simulation can be partial (a part of the game) or full (the full game referee)
 Nerchio: so minimax and beamsearch sounds like a sim then
 MSmits: they use simulations yes
 MSmits: the difference is in which states to keep or which states to consider best
 MSmits: also minimax is adversarial
 MSmits: you do a move, opponent does a move
 MSmits: beamsearch is mostly just you
 Nerchio: i can probably evaluate future with if statements as well :D
 MSmits: in many games that won't be enough
 MSmits: especially simple board games
 Nerchio: yeah this is the first one i played so i need different environment to go out of this 'comfort' zone
 Nerchio: i mean different challenges
 MSmits: yeah, just do the simples possible game to simulate and practice searches
 MSmits: its fun
 Nagatwin: wlesavo which multi is this&#160;?
 MSmits: ooc contribution
 MSmits: some old bots in there
 MSmits: wlesavo is enjoying beating the crap out of them
 Nagatwin: xan't find haha
 MSmits: it was linked in the pm thread
 Nagatwin: oh thx
 cegprakash: hey eulerscheZahl
 cegprakash: There could have been a wood3 league with 3 lives with only MOVE and SURFACE commands.
 cegprakash: can u add this league in the multi?
 MSmits: thats not going to happen I think
 MSmits: current bots will be automatically submitted
 Scarfield: Nerchio i can recommend Bandas or Breakthrough, they are fairly easy to simulate, and you can use bitboards fairly easily as well&#160;:)
 MSmits: if you're going to make changes they would all be broken
 MSmits: Scarfield is right, they are great games to try for this
 Magus: Nerchio was the name of a Starcraft 2 PGM i liked. But i assume you are not that Nerchio :D
 cegprakash: but I felt wood2 was hard in this contest
 Nerchio:&#160;;)
 cegprakash: taking too much time
 MSmits: yes the woods were hard\
 cegprakash: Awood3 league with 3 lives with only MOVE and SURFACE commands could have made it easier
 cegprakash: with boss using just SURFACE often
 cegprakash: to kill himself
 MSmits: yep, it's really a good idea cegprakash
 MSmits: but too late&#160;:(
 struct: Magus he is
 Magus: Prove it&#160;!
 Scarfield: for MiniMax this video explains it really well <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp3VMe0Jpf8&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp3VMe0Jpf8&amp;</a>
 Nerchio: i will watch thanks!
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 struct: Magus I could have taken a screenshot but I didnt
 Scarfield: will look forward to you beating me with other algorithms xD
 struct: but he typed on thibpat chat on twitch
 struct: with Nerchio account
 Nerchio: if anything i can beat you with time spend on programming lol
 struct: So I guess there is that
 Nerchio: not sure if algos would be enough Scarfield xd
 Magus: i doubt you can beat me at time spend on programming :o
 Nerchio: i mean during a challenge
 Magus: Oh, probably
 Nerchio: for this i spend probably 80 hours writing if statements
 Magus: But if you really are Nerchio, it's kind of fun encoutering you here ... :D
 MSmits: Nerchio if you really like contests with lots of heuristics, please try code a la mode. No search required
 MSmits: people used hundreds of ifs
 Nerchio: idk I think i will try to learn something new maybe
 struct: Yavalath
 MSmits: i used a beamsearch, but most above me did not search at all
 Nerchio: i went through a list looks like a lot of fun multis so have stuff to do
 MSmits: yeah, probably better to learn searches
 MSmits: I only did half of them myself
 struct: Yavalath will probably make you learn some new stuff
 struct: MSmits needs a challenge tehre
 Astrobytes: struct you're such a Yavangelist
 MSmits: dont do yavalath Nerchio... thats a more expert version of those boardgames I talked about. Complex sim and not easy to write a search either
 MSmits: but sure, I welcome more players on that board&#160;:)
 Nerchio: haha
 Nerchio: leader!
 Nerchio: master of beamsearch?
 MSmits: no this is not beamsearch
 MSmits: on yavalath i do mcts
 MSmits: but not a basic version, very  heavily modified
 MSmits: uttt is the most popular board game
 MSmits: if you want to have an easy simulated game
 MSmits: it starts with regular tic tac toe up to bronze
 eulerscheZahl: but UTTT is hard to follow as a human
 eulerscheZahl: you don't see if you are winning or losing until the game is over
 MSmits: yeah, i only recently felt I started getting the hang  of some easy heuristics a human can use
 Nerchio: idk i dont like tic tac toe i will stick to some other stuff :D
 ThomasNicoullaud: thx eulerscheZahl, your stats just showed me that i forgot to add SILENCE 0 in my playlist -_-
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Nerchio: but yea YAVALATH doesnt look like it would be easy to beat with if statements :p
 ThomasNicoullaud: there is a realy big impact SILENCE 0&#160;?
 wlesavo: its only big if your estimation of silence is bad
 Nerchio: 95,9% of 0 silence by me
 wlesavo: at least i think so
 Nerchio: shame on me&#160;:(
 ThomasNicoullaud: i track it, but not play it in my minmax
 MSmits: ahh I am happy, 82% silence 0. Seems like I succeeded throwing some other silences in there at the last moment&#160;:)
 MSmits: coded it at 2 am last night
 pde-bakk: who is w7
 wlesavo: seing how many people using more advanced stuff then simple heuristics i am surprised by making yop20
 MSmits: I am most surprised by you doing it in python
 MSmits: there's some calculation heavy stuff in this game
 MSmits: thats probably the stuff you had to leave out
 eulerscheZahl: in other games you wouldn't stand a chance without a proper searchsometimes it's hard to tell before, if a search is mandatory
 eulerscheZahl: but here there are lots of uncertainties (fog of war) that make it hard to search
 Nerchio: i would consider myself getting to legend with brute force
 ThomasNicoullaud: wlesavo, lot of people hate you in top gold :D
 Nerchio: got some small stuff right, got a lot of stuff wrong :p
 MSmits: lol ThomasNicoullaud
 wlesavo: i do most of calculations with a treshold, i.e. if there are less candidates, or mines, or whatever needed
 eulerscheZahl: people from FR chat?
 MSmits: I have myself considered a few times writing some disparaging comments when wlesavo, during my fight to pass gold boss :P
 MSmits: when wlesavo was on :P
 wlesavo: oh, i forgot to appologize for the random boss in PM
 MSmits: ah that isnt even what bothered me. Just that it was damn strong 
 darkhorse64: tbh, I never beat wlesavo bot. I was pushed
 MSmits: but it is supposed to be
 eulerscheZahl: i was pushed too
 MSmits: oh, I had a 58% winrate vs it, but I did poorly against other players
 ThomasNicoullaud: when i'm entering legend, have only 30/70 on gold boss :s shame on me
 MSmits: so i had to chain-spam submits
 wlesavo: well it was top 10 at a time with suboptimal parameters
 ThomasNicoullaud: this boss was insane
 eulerscheZahl: i had a winrate around 80% vs the boss, still pushed
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: you didnt spam enough then euler
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't have to
 eulerscheZahl: submit ended, then i waited 5min
 MSmits: ah, then it was just a very strong submit
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know
 Illedan: I came along and wrecked the boss :P
 MSmits: hey... i figured you got into legend from the start btw
 MSmits: didnt know you were left behind
 eulerscheZahl: not as hard as i did Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: promoted about 2h after legend opening
 MSmits: ah ok. For me it was 1 week&#160;:)
 wlesavo: dbdr also was left behind i believe
 eulerscheZahl: and then you bypassed me
 ThomasNicoullaud: for me it was REALY one week
 MSmits: not significantly, but yeah, seems you were right once again
 ThomasNicoullaud: depressing
 MSmits: but you made it
 MSmits: could be much worse
 ThomasNicoullaud: MSmits you stated late&#160;?
 MSmits: no, i took several long breaks
 MSmits: two breaks of at least a week long
 VincentBab: #22, so sad&#160;:(but that contest was no nice&#160;:)thanks to the authors&#160;!
 ThomasNicoullaud: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: you have another chance very soon
 MSmits: yeah!
 Scarfield: yea big thanks&#160;:)
 Skril: Yes, thanks for this very entertaining contest&#160;:-)and gg to all
 Illedan: gg&#160;:)
 Illedan: VincentBab, you can try more:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8396250c21e3f21e3bd77a4e567e27e40c488e">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8396250c21e3f21e3bd77a4e567e27e40c488e</a>And later today as a real multi again
 eulerscheZahl: or try another game if you played OOC too much recently
 wlesavo: hehe still first after illedan updated his bot
 Illedan: Ok, I'll submit something better than your thingy ^^
 eulerscheZahl: that's an area to test the game, not the bots. there aren't enough battles to tell anything
 wlesavo: it ok, i already made my screenshoots
 eulerscheZahl: and you shared it on the forum
 eulerscheZahl: as an imgur link instead of as an image directly
 Illedan: :D
 AntiSquid: when does it go live?
 eulerscheZahl: today
 AntiSquid: ya time @_@
 VincentBab: Haha nice Illedan, I surely willBut i'm a bit disapointed for the t-shirt :P
 eulerscheZahl: when Saiksy is ready
 Illedan: Soon a new contest&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000's body is ready
 Automaton2000: yeah i do the same.
 wlesavo: AntiSquid are you gonna try it today?
 AntiSquid: try what?
 wlesavo: multi
 AntiSquid: ah ooc no
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl Illedan the best thing I liked about this contest is that there is actually no real meta
 cegprakash: very balanced game I felt
 cegprakash: lot of strat to counter lot of strats
 cegprakash: no skills are OP
 eulerscheZahl: meta = be passive and hide your location
 wlesavo: true
 cegprakash: not really
 wlesavo: early battles were quite random
 cegprakash: mining is not passive
 ZarthaxX: hello
 cegprakash: u did mining
 struct: ofc mining is passive
 cegprakash: if mining is passive, my entire bot is passive
 struct: trigger is noit
 struct: not{
 eulerscheZahl: but you can add a few silence actions after your mine placement to make it more passive
 cegprakash: well if u mine ofc u will write trigger code
 cegprakash: that's not passive
 eulerscheZahl: not really passive. but less revealing regarding your own position
 wlesavo: less forcing a direct fight
 cegprakash: well that's because it's a turn based game
 eulerscheZahl: attack the opponent without risking a blue eye
 cegprakash: whoever gets closer can git hit first
 cegprakash: and that's bad
 cegprakash: there is nearly no comeback from that
 iFightLegends: In the leaderboard what does the number in the "Score"-column mean?
 eulerscheZahl: it shows your score
 eulerscheZahl: mu-sigma i think
 cegprakash: it's like your win rate points iFightLegends
 iFightLegends: Oh I just see when I hove over it, it says True Skill system, guess I gotta google that then
 wlesavo: cegprakash i often lose having a health advantage against top players
 cegprakash: finisher blow? wlesavo?
 wlesavo: not really, bad fighting
 cegprakash: yeah need combos for sure
 wlesavo: especially at the time i had bad charging oreder
 wlesavo: order
 wlesavo: i.e. move carging smth, then torpedoing
 wlesavo: after i fixed that it was better but still
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl is it possible to estimate for what period of time stats were collected?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean my huge table?
 wlesavo: i mean last one with 42k replays
 ZarthaxX: gz wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: i started at 10am todaythe stats shown are only the most recent arena version
 eulerscheZahl: some opponents are outdated version though
 eulerscheZahl: so full final rerun + last battles from submit to reach the finals
 wlesavo: ZarthaxX thx :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: if i find multiple version of your bot (last battles of your opponents), i only show the most recent
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl so it does include final rerun?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 eulerscheZahl: it's a mess but it's your mess now:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/335e87cd-46be-4eb9-90ef-1716c2a4a8ea">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/335e87cd-46be-4eb9-90ef-1716c2a4a8ea</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i would share the replays too but 4.9GB is quite a lot
 wlesavo: wow, thx
 ThomasNicoullaud: eulerscheZahl have you a developer team with you for do challenge, Visual board App and, statistics App&#160;? Do you sleep 1h by night&#160;? What is your secret&#160;? :D
 eulerscheZahl: the replay animation was quite simple actually. i usually do that for a contest
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31320893-1012-471e-86e7-c1ba4c776b6e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/31320893-1012-471e-86e7-c1ba4c776b6e</a>
 eulerscheZahl: just about 40 lines
 eulerscheZahl: the stats took a little longer (had to look up how charts work, not part of my daily coding job)
 eulerscheZahl: but for a 1 month contest one can invest some time in tools
 Zenoscave: 3rd in my language! 
 Zenoscave: I'm counting this a success
 ThomasNicoullaud: :thumbsup: eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i might even write something about tooling as i good setup can help a lot (local debugging)
 eulerscheZahl: congrats Zenoscaveand thanks for letting me keep 2nd at least
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 Zenoscave: I had no chance. I lost too many in the mine field and combat
 wlesavo: that would be really interesting to read
 ThomasNicoullaud: +1
 eulerscheZahl: on tech.io we can define our own docker containers. so i consider some python with requests lib to pull data (not sure if we get internet access, would have to try)
 Zenoscave: if you make a docker container on tech.io can we pull the container or is it private&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i could include the docker container (i would just take an existing one) to use some libraries
 Zenoscave: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: like requests which isn't available in the default python version of tech.io
 Zenoscave: right
 eulerscheZahl: so i think about sharing some code snippets that you can modify on the tech.io website for testing
 Zenoscave: Did anyone get CP from this contest? I'm at 0/10000 right now
 eulerscheZahl: update once a day
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if this night already or later
 Zenoscave: ah I forgot
 ZarthaxX: recalc started with our current position right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 blasterpoard: 1500 word PM is up
 eulerscheZahl: i'll give it a like first and read it later then
 ZarthaxX: great blasterpoard
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for the effort, i'll read it for sure
 blasterpoard: some people pinged me saying they wanted to read it, so enjoy
 Uljahn: thx

 cegprakash: my post mortem
 cegprakash: the most awaited by everyone
 eulerscheZahl: thanks humble cegprakash
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl I need to start using animations to get more hearts
 eulerscheZahl: and tables with charts
 cegprakash: how to make animations like you made
 cegprakash: you build a tool and record video and convert to gif?
 eulerscheZahl: i do that for most of my contest bots but don't always share it
 eulerscheZahl: i generate a .png for each single frame
 eulerscheZahl: then i use imagemagick:convert *.png replay.gif
 eulerscheZahl: from the command line
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: nice
 wlesavo: blasterpoard thx
 wlesavo: blasterpoard some things looks like a total overkill but im facinated by this. Is offensive mine planting a heuristic or the result of fighting simulation in some way?
 blasterpoard: wlesavo <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/448843760">https://www.codingame.com/replay/448843760</a>
 blasterpoard: this is offensive mine planting
 wlesavo: no i remember you sharing the replays of it
 blasterpoard: simulation
 blasterpoard: "simulation"
 wlesavo: wow
 wlesavo: nice
 blasterpoard: depth 1
 blasterpoard: or 2,if you count my turn and opponent's turn as 2 turns
 wlesavo: but is it a specific simulation for this case or included in major one?
 blasterpoard: it's just keeping the mine when I think I'll encounter the enemy within 3 turns
 blasterpoard: and using it when I'm close
 blasterpoard: and then taking it into account in eval
 wlesavo: i see
 blasterpoard: didn't really work (I think), because at the beginning of the fight, opponent just silenced anyway
 blasterpoard: but it might be a good way to punish using silence excessively
 blasterpoard: just combo the opponent in 3 turns when he finally runs out of squares
 wolf-555: can search users here by uni?
 wolf-555: can i*
 icecream17: All my ooc contest code history is lost! How do I get my wood code back?
 MSmits: do we get submitted to wood?
 icecream17: no, i'm just doing the multi demo for now
 MSmits: ah
 icecream17: Oh, in the demo you can go forward leagues? Wow'
 MSmits: I'm just wondering, because in earlier contests we had to keep our wood code, or turn off parts of our bronze + code to get through wood
 MSmits: (when it was submitted as a multi)
 icecream17: I better prepare.... hopefully i'll be one of the first to get to bronze
 MSmits: doesnt matter really, if you're the first. Also your code gets submitted automaticall
 icecream17: Really? Oh.
 MSmits: I just am not sure if they make us go up through wood, or if we just appear in the league that we reached during contest
 darkhorse64: you just appear
 darkhorse64: but no xp
 MSmits: aww
 MSmits: I'll take the cp&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Another leap in thee leaderboard
 MSmits: yeah
 icecream17: Hey, look! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/ocean-of-code</a>
 wlesavo: wow
 icecream17: what? how? (...)
 wlesavo: smth went wrong
 icecream17: I got it from searching ocean of code, but I guess deleted now... (super fast)
 ZarthaxX: wait so darkhorse64 that way if you didnt do contest u get the same xp for getting to legend as the ones that did the contest?
 ZarthaxX: no disadvantage of xp
 wlesavo: oh, its working in ide <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ocean-of-code</a>
 aCat: whoh&#160;;]
 aCat: so multi is on the way&#160;;-)
 darkhorse64: You are absolutely right and I think it's fairere this way
 darkhorse64: *fairer*
 icecream17: Hmm... what happens if I submit? It says "no battles" so i'm assuming the leaderboard is more variable than ever.
 aCat: damn, I really was wishing for the double xp&#160;:(
 aCat: but it's fairer definitely
 darkhorse64: My point is that it used to be different 
 icecream17: Maybe I can come up with an easter egg. If a user finds it, they get xp. If they tell anyone, they lose 10x the xp.
 Nerchio: oh its up already? :D
 icecream17: jmRMkpqm0hwFAZKVdOnhYhrA1wMZKwTptmwk7YKIInA=
 icecream17: (random encrpyter online)
 icecream17: I don't have any ideas yet.... maybe something to do with....
 aCat: but I like this part of not thinking what to cut to make code feasible for wood leagues ;p
 icecream17: =O I got an amazing idea! Too bad I don't know how to do it...
 icecream17: How much XP should the user earn for the easter egg? 1? 1000?
 icecream17: I pressed submit in the ide. But i'm only playing against the boss
 icecream17: Oh no! I lost 3 times in a row and i'm now 429th
 icecream17: Oh nevermind. The first one was a tie.
 icecream17: First 10 games is 1 tie and 4 wins against the boss.
 icecream17: Oops. I forgot it was Monday. I have to do at-home-learning
 icecream17: 5th place! If I can beat the boss before anyone else submits....
 icecream17: (unlikely)
 metahom: thats an odd submit
 metahom: i play only Nerchio
 icecream17: Nice.
 Nerchio: i submited as well before
 Nerchio: i guess thats how it works xd
 icecream17: which league?
 metahom: like one of us pays other to make dummy submit and gets #1 ))
 Nerchio: it looks like i got XP as well weird
 icecream17: If someone submits, I hope that person loses against me a lot but wins against the boss a lot.
 icecream17: The boss always silence 0. So maybe.....
 Nerchio: wanted to try playing ghost in a cell but the window that shows the game is bugged meh :p
 ZarthaxX: u got xp? wot
 Nerchio: im not sure if i did because i dont know how much i had before
 Nerchio: but it spammed achievements for me with xp
 icecream17: I'm playing against random people now! What happenned?
 Astrobytes: has OOC reappeared in the multi section?
 Nerchio: y
 ZarthaxX: weird..
 wlesavo: Nerchio it is probably different contest related achievments
 metahom: Nerchio, I resubmitted and its working well
 icecream17: Wow. I win against the top ten? That's surprising. I always lose against bottom 100.
 Nerchio: idk in chrome its bugged out
 Nerchio: maybe another reason to use firefox
 Nerchio: it works well there&#160;:)
 metahom: I use chrome too
 wlesavo: Astrobytes weirdly enough only in the ide
 Nerchio: game window resizes for me and i see only a corner of the map :p
 Nerchio: btw
 Astrobytes: wlesavo that'll be the reason the submissions are weird I guess
 Nerchio: you can't change class name right?
 Nerchio: it will always look for Player -&gt; main
 wlesavo: Astrobytes for sure, submits on your own risk i guess
 Astrobytes: I think I'll wait
 MSmits: whats going on guys
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/ocean-of-code</a>
 Astrobytes: I mean, you can't even access the full leaderboard
 MSmits: I think they improved it
 Astrobytes: MSmits OOC appeared in the multi section, then disappeared, yet still available via that link
 MSmits: because
 MSmits: I'm 24 now&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Hence I don't believe it's officially live yet
 wlesavo: yeah, but i got pushed to
 MSmits: nerchio pushing
 wlesavo: still funny
 MSmits: and duke nukem
 MSmits: and polar bear
 wlesavo: having the history of submits is great though
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: not so much if you discover a bug in it 
 MSmits: That's one reason I dont go back to old contests
 Astrobytes: from discord: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7c3b066-8bfe-42b4-a769-8055f7c7c6ad">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a7c3b066-8bfe-42b4-a769-8055f7c7c6ad</a>
 wlesavo: auto manual transfer lol
 vbplaya: Can someone answer something for me?  In the attached replay, I noticed that "lordgun" has some status messages that appear under his picture.  Is this something he programmed in and if so, how do I do that (for future contests)?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/453190392">https://www.codingame.com/replay/453190392</a>
 Nerchio: add MSG
 Nerchio: to your bot
 Astrobytes: vbplaya it's the MSG command
 Nerchio: its for this contest specific ;P
 vbplaya: ok ... so maybe cant' do for the one coming up soon.
 wlesavo: some other have that too
 Nerchio: move W torpedo | MSG You ded
 vbplaya: OH, thanks Nerchio.
 Nerchio: we dont know if we will be able to do this in next contest yet
 vbplaya: This was my first contest, and I really enjoyed it.  Gonna do this one coming up too.
 vbplaya: Are you one of the designers of these contests Nerchio?
 Nerchio: haha
 Nerchio: absolutely not
 Nerchio: this was also my first challenge 
 vbplaya: Ok, sorry, from your response I thought you might be
 Nerchio: yea i mean
 Nerchio: we as 'players' dont know if msg-style action will be available :p
 vbplaya: Well, thanks for your response.  How did you do in this one?
 Nerchio: depends who you ask&#160;;)
 Nerchio: i was ~45 in legend or something around that
 Nerchio: satisfied and disappointed at the same time
 vbplaya: Well, just being in legend is awesome (IMO)
 Nerchio: but in some ways i wanted to fix my bot but it was to big of a mess to change in the end
 MSmits: you're not alone in that
 vbplaya: we have very different standards ... I just wanted to be in the top 50% because I missed the first 2 weeks ... and I got to silver and in the top 50% ... so I'm happy about that
 Astrobytes: It's back in the multi section
 MSmits: cool
 Nerchio: i might try ghost in a cell now
 Nerchio: :p
 vbplaya: ya, I learned a lot about how I will approach this next time.
 Astrobytes: Did you also read the PMs in the forum vbplaya?
 vbplaya: I also did this entire contest without looking at anyone's video or getting any info from people in the PMs and so forth because I wanted to see how I would do without any other help.
 vbplaya: So NO ... I didn't ... next time I will though ... just wanted to see what I came up with on my own.
 Astrobytes: No, the post-mortems, the after contest reports
 Astrobytes: for OOC
 vbplaya: Oh, sorry ... misunderstood you ... what is that ... and how do I look at it?

 vbplaya: Oh, VERY cool Astrobytes ... thanks for pointing me there ... I didn't know about this.  it will be very helpful.
 Astrobytes: no worries vbplaya, they do that after every contest btw
 vbplaya: Good to know ... I've got a lot to learn so this is definitely a useful resource.
 MSmits: AntiSquid really did a ML bot??
 MSmits: I thought he just suggested that it would be a good idea
 Astrobytes: Tried
 MSmits: pretty ballsy, hat off to you sir AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: He spoke about it, was near end of first week/start of second iirc?
 MSmits: yeah but people suggest ML all the time, it's different from actually going ahead with it, especially in a contest
 AntiSquid: nothing ballsy imo ... it's just maths
 Astrobytes: Everything is 'just maths'&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: and it felt like cutting corners if i actually make it work
 MSmits: mmh maybe, it's still taking a risk
 MSmits: thats what I meant
 Astrobytes: Will you try again?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: Nice, hope you get it working
 MSmits: yes that would be cool
 AntiSquid: ya me too, i mean i hope to somehow apply ml to all games
 MSmits: some games aren't suited though, I know of a few
 MSmits: esp some of those nearly solved board games
 AntiSquid: not suited for my current knowledge or skill, but imo all suitable 
 MSmits: I mean... a NN would use coding space that could fit an opening book that will wreck your nn :P
 MSmits: it's a weird exception probably
 MSmits: uttt is one
 MSmits: nn would be awesome for meanmax and such I believe
 MSmits: it would make sense of the chaos like nothing else can
 MSmits: re curse was working on FB which has a similar engine and setup
 MSmits: not sure if that got off the ground fully
 Astrobytes: Was still working on it afaik
 MSmits: ah ok
 wlesavo: AntiSquid wow nice, i hope if you will succeed we will get an update
 Nerchio: if not we dont want to hear about it :joy:
 wlesavo: somehow this weird submits pushed me a lot, not really pushed me but drugged people around lower
 Astrobytes: dragged :D
 wlesavo: lol
 Astrobytes: It's crush/crash all over again :P
 Nerchio: top16 POG
 Nerchio: #1 soon!
 wlesavo: yeah
 Nerchio: i played
 Nerchio: 200 games
 Nerchio: against amusruskin
 wlesavo: lol
 Nerchio: 240 actualy
 wlesavo: who won
 Nerchio: i guess me
 Nerchio: since i am top 13 now
 Nerchio: xD
 eulerscheZahl: what's POG?
 Nerchio: PogChamp refers to an emote, a small image used in chats on the video game streaming platform Twitch, used to express shock, surprise, or excitement.
 Nerchio: copied from google
 eulerscheZahl: ah, thanks :D
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i just admitted that i don't use twitch
 Nerchio: world spins around faster and faster i can hardly follow some things as well :p
 Nerchio: i like to have twitch open on one of the monitors though
 Astrobytes: I use it for CG streams and some other stuff sometimes but the emotes fly over my head
 JFB: Nerchio - last I checked world (Earth) spin once per 24 hours.&#160;;-)
 AntiSquid: there are emotes on twitch you can only see as a premium user
 Nerchio: did you guys play ghost in a cell I want to try it now
 eulerscheZahl: around the own axis
 eulerscheZahl: but once a year it spins around the sun
 eulerscheZahl: i did, liked the game
 JFB: eulerscheZahl - true
 Nerchio: when i look at the concept it feels like it will be hard to go far with if statements :p
 eulerscheZahl: you don't need a heavy simulation (will be hard with that huge branching)
 eulerscheZahl: but you should do some computations to send the right amount of troops to defend your bases
 Nerchio: you are top5 there nice :D
 eulerscheZahl: i am? i thought 6th
 eulerscheZahl: i guess someone pushed me
 Nerchio: y 5
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 Nerchio: 184 people in legend haha :p
 eulerscheZahl: PED broken with his python2? used to be first
 eulerscheZahl: looking at his last battles: definitely broken
 Nerchio: python in a calculation game?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not that CPU intense
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl that python you shared earlier in a paste. can you share it again?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Zenoscave: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: this?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56b40da3-4573-4493-aa46-db738b84f8ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56b40da3-4573-4493-aa46-db738b84f8ae</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh it's trimmed
 Zenoscave: thats the one
 wlesavo: when will cp points arrive?
 Zenoscave: pastebin maybe?
 Zenoscave: tonight wlesavo
 wlesavo: thx
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/30Ln3PiB">https://pastebin.com/30Ln3PiB</a>
 Zenoscave: once a day or so i am told
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: your replay stats analysis script?
 eulerscheZahl: yeahi do download and analysis in 2 scripts
 eulerscheZahl: so a bug in the analyzer won't ruin my downloads and force me to do it again
 Zenoscave: smart
 Astrobytes: Yeah, sensible
 eulerscheZahl: common sense i would say
 Zenoscave: Separation of concerns
 ThomasNicoullaud: i see that initial position of the final run is really important&#160;:( 
 eulerscheZahl: i did a test at BotG
 eulerscheZahl: had a bot ranked around 40
 Nerchio: yeah sad my last commit was really weak&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: broke it on purpose (kill switch to play strong in the rerun but poorly before)
 eulerscheZahl: climbed from 98 to 73 i think
 eulerscheZahl: still far away from my old rank
 eulerscheZahl: and that's how i ruined my contest result :D
 Astrobytes: You took one for the team
 ThomasNicoullaud: at 8h i was 15th ... but lot a of people submit and push me 35th&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: wait you are a mod?
 ZarthaxX: wat
 ThomasNicoullaud: i should submit juste before rerun
 eulerscheZahl: for 2 months
 Nerchio: it says right there
 Nerchio: moderator
 Nerchio:&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: i know 
 ZarthaxX: dont understand why
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Tardax strikes again :P
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 eulerscheZahl: to kick you of course
 ThomasNicoullaud:&#160;:]
 AntiSquid: why the name calling for ZarthaxX though?
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl :D
 eulerscheZahl: is that a German-only fairy tale?grandma, why do you have such big eyes?
 Astrobytes: No the 'tard thing came about the other week
 eulerscheZahl: why do you have such big ears?
 Astrobytes: Little Red Riding Hood
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: Rotkäppchen
 AntiSquid: why do you have such a big coc grandma?
 Astrobytes: Oh ffs 
 Nerchio: lol
 AntiSquid: clash of code i meant, she wasn't playing shortest mode well
 Nerchio: so you are trying to apply neural network to coc?
 icecream17: What!? I added 10 lines... and won 10 out of the 10 first games in Ooc?
 IAmNoob: hi
 icecream17: hi
 smcbot35: r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-rip
 AntiSquid: ban?
 AntiSquid: or kick?
 MSmits: maybe it's a game map
 MSmits: like the start of Onitama
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff6db9d5-de36-4e6f-b01d-0a492461b923">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff6db9d5-de36-4e6f-b01d-0a492461b923</a>
 Astrobytes: lol
 icecream17: NN plays clash of code....
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: pretty sure there is not a neural network on clash of code
 icecream17: Just an idea I had. Probably bad
 MSmits: ah, well it's not workable
 MSmits: NN are not suitable for creating things out of nothing
 MSmits: it can't code for you
 YannT: PM posted&#160;:)
 MSmits: if it could, that would be scary
 MSmits: will read YannT
 MSmits: seriously, 600 lines of code
 MSmits: i know it's kotlin, but...
 YannT: yup&#160;:)
 YannT: 637 exactly&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;1400 here
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: I ended with 2700 or so
 MSmits: much duplicate code I did not have the patience to whittle down
 MSmits: like: Oh I need to check for torpedo before and after move? ... copy paste, done
 MSmits: possibly i should not have been so lazy with those long breaks :P
 icecream17: The while loop in my code is from lines 127 to 369 ......handleOpponent from 444 to 939..........
 eulerscheZahl: did you use a single file for that or did you merge multiples MSmits?
 MSmits: single file
 MSmits: great fun scrolling :P
 eulerscheZahl: first time i used a code bundler on CG
 icecream17: Multiple files? You can do that?
 eulerscheZahl: liked it that way much more on RAIC where you can submit zip files
 eulerscheZahl: icecream17 you need a script to paste multiple files into one
 MSmits: it's just for when you are working on it icecream17, to work more easily
 MSmits: I just minimize most functions and it's doable
 MSmits: not great, but doable
 icecream17: i'm sorry... but... minimize???
 IAmNoob: good game
 MSmits: Visual studio
 MSmits: you can minimize functions. I expect any good IDE will allow this
 icecream17:&#160;?
 MSmits: if you use C#, you can even add regions
 IAmNoob: we dont need minimize
 MSmits: and minimize those
 wlesavo: YannT lol feeling bad for wala having to delete spaces
 IAmNoob: are u a c#?
 MSmits: sometimes, this contest i used c++
 eulerscheZahl: ah, minimize = collapse
 MSmits: ah right, collapse, sorry
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i thought about minifying
 IAmNoob: MSmits I am developer in c++
 icecream17: still dont understand
 MSmits: icecream17, are you on windows
 Astrobytes: icecream17 look in the CG IDE
 icecream17: chrome
 Astrobytes: do you see those arrows
 MSmits: yes but on windows right... chrome is a browser
 IAmNoob: do you want to come in a game?
 eulerscheZahl: Chrome OS
 Astrobytes: next to the line numbers
 MSmits: oh chrome os
 IAmNoob: icecream17&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: chrome
 MSmits: well, you can minimize your window on chome os too I am guessing
 icecream17: OS?
 MSmits: i dont think he is on chrome OS :P
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 Astrobytes: icecream17 the arrows next to the line numbers in the CG browser IDE will collapse functions
 AntiSquid: very low level trolling, please stop, IAmNoob
 eulerscheZahl: there is a red X at the top right icecream17. when you click it, what do you see behind?
 IAmNoob: who want a clash?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: a red X&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: oh, will he find the way back to CG now?
 icecream17: red???
 MSmits: i predicted it
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, looks different to me
 MSmits: just 1 extra questionmark
 icecream17: Oh you mean close window?
 ZarthaxX: toad troll
 icecream17: (no response)
 MSmits: icecream17, we just mean, you can make stuff small so you cant see it
 MSmits: you can do it with browser windows and you can do it with code
 eulerscheZahl: here, no X<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/4BiOa1V">https://imgur.com/a/4BiOa1V</a>i don't know which color it should have
 MSmits: so that if you write thousands of lines, it doesnt become untenable
 AntiSquid: i don't have a red x what should i do? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/AFbjLgJ">https://imgur.com/a/AFbjLgJ</a>
 icecream17: Woah. The line arrow thing is interesting
 eulerscheZahl: but you have an X
 IAmNoob: good game
 AntiSquid: but since it's not red it looks scary to me
 AntiSquid: not gonna touch it
 IAmNoob: who wantws a clash?
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c280a9ca-03f0-4447-a12d-9df11b60d2fa">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c280a9ca-03f0-4447-a12d-9df11b60d2fa</a>
 AntiSquid: IAmNoob talk to AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: who knows what is that in this contest?
 MSmits: :clap:
 icecream17: AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: ww=wood 1 to drone
 IAmNoob: AntiSquid?
 Astrobytes: IAmNoob Start a clash, and people will join
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: thx
 MSmits: icecream17 didnt you have to do homeschooling&#160;?
 MSmits: I'm a teacher, if you're slacking, I will tell your teacher
 MSmits: we all know eachother
 Astrobytes: Master Smits laying down the law
 Astrobytes: Connecting to the Teacher Hivemind
 MSmits: exactly
 AntiSquid: icecream17 have your teacher fight MSmits, see who is stronger
 Nerchio: what are you teaching msmits
 Nerchio: biology?
 MSmits: ack no
 MSmits: physics mostly, but i am transitioning partially to computer science
 AntiSquid: bio-physics
 MSmits: not at all
 Nerchio: too smart for me
 MSmits: biology is way harder than physics
 IAmNoob: yeah
 Astrobytes: No it ain't
 Nerchio: i dont know anything about either
 IAmNoob: i am a phd physics
 IAmNoob: and tried biology too
 IAmNoob: and saw that physics is better
 MSmits: the smallest unit of life is a cell and it's too complicated to understand
 MSmits: the smallest unit in physics is an elementary particle and it's super simple
 Astrobytes: By incorporating physics it can help to understand
 Astrobytes: *understand the workings of the cell
 Astrobytes: The deeper you dig it becomes biochemistry, then just chemistry, then physical chemistry then physics
 MSmits: the hard part is to understand how it all fits together
 Astrobytes: So much going on in those wee cells. It's magnificent.
 YannT: ahhh merging paths!
 YannT: why didn't I think of that&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: "the hard part is to understand how it all fits together" - it's also the fun part!
 IAmNoob: yeah
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzcTgrxMzZk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzcTgrxMzZk</a>
 IAmNoob: and to make a simulation on PC
 IAmNoob: to see how it behaives
 YannT: I had a reset (kinda like surface) but I didn't want to lower the threshold for that because there's information loss so I instead accept the occasional timeout
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know that one MSmits, glad it wasn't another Disney song :P
 YannT: the merging idea would've allowed me to have a lower threshold and not time out!
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: BlitzProg why 4096 possibilities? i don't understand
 MSmits: nagatwin shared earlier that he also got rid of duplicates
 MSmits: you can do that before merging
 YannT: I did that
 MSmits: I just merged but didnt worry about duplicates
 YannT: there's never any 
 Astrobytes: I thought Naga would have done a pm
 YannT: I would simulate opponent surface and then depublicate, keeping only one for each position
 eulerscheZahl: just 7 timeouts YannT, not too bad
 MSmits: it surprised me i got so many crashes in your statistics
 MSmits: didnt seem like that when i was testing
 MSmits: out of how many games was this?
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: this is not just the recalc?
 YannT: I usually had about 2% timeouts, but I removed all debugging for the final submit so that probably helped
 YannT: but when I say 2%, I mean vs. top5, vs. you it was probably a lot more than that
 MSmits: 34 out of 1151 matches
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: vs me you had a ton
 MSmits: If it was just me and you on the leaderboard I'm not even sure you would still be above me 
 YannT: in the end I doubt that had any real impact, I blame my horrible pathing choice for not getting top10 :p
 YannT: but the merging idea would've been nice
 YannT: I just didn't think of that
 eulerscheZahl: smits killed me. not with violence but with silence
 YannT: so I decided to live with a higher threshold and some timeouts instead
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: is this what happened in the recalc euler?
 MSmits: too close to me on the board?
 eulerscheZahl: nah, just a too high rank before the recalc
 MSmits: ah ok, i figured you got too many games vs me and dropped from the timeouts
 eulerscheZahl: possible
 MSmits: your stats say i silenced exactly twice as much as you
 eulerscheZahl: but my winrate vs you isn't an outliner
 MSmits: and in the top 25 there was only 1 person who did more silence than me, slightly
 MSmits: daaskare
 eulerscheZahl: but you crashed a lot too
 IAmNoob: what is the clan GC?
 MSmits: well 3%
 MSmits: not too bad
 IAmNoob: CG*
 MSmits: i was wondering though, your stats, from which point did you take them?
 Astrobytes: It means Codingame staff IAmNoob
 MSmits: is it just recalc?
 IAmNoob: thx
 eulerscheZahl: i started at 10am
 MSmits: or several days?
 MSmits: oh
 eulerscheZahl: so recalc + directly before
 MSmits: ok then its right i guess
 eulerscheZahl: but if you have multiple versions in my history, i only consider the latest
 MSmits: i fixed some errors with timeouts yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: but it includes your stats vs outdated opponents
 eulerscheZahl: you can see that if you analyze the script i shared a little ealier&#160;;)
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: 2 guys in all of your stats that did more silence. I guess that explained why i used so few mines
 MSmits: I was really conservative with placement, in my games you see them covering the map far apart 
 MSmits: i did prioritize mines over silence, but if my bot is not allowed to place very often, i still silence a lot
 eulerscheZahl: 61%
 MSmits: this would have been a helpful tool during contest as well
 MSmits: i never knew i was that silency
 wlesavo: based on just that stats i guess we can improve quite a bit
 YannT: I told you :p
 MSmits: funny how it says "other"
 eulerscheZahl: and bots are surprisingly different even at higher ranks
 eulerscheZahl: there isn't that one way
 YannT: I literally told you you silenced a lot and that was bad because it means you lose a lot of time charging it back up&#160;;)
 MSmits: when?
 MSmits: my bot changed a bit
 MSmits: I think it got less silency, but apparently not that much less
 MSmits: ah well, it helped me anyways.
 MSmits: timing people out :P
 YannT: when we were discussing my timeouts and I explained why I didn't consider it much of an issue&#160;;)
 YannT: chain silence don't win
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: but thats not what i do
 MSmits: check my mine damage, its still a lot
 MSmits: but i do it with way fewer mines
 MSmits: bout the same as yours i think
 MSmits: as far as you can compare us... because we dont face the same opponent
 YannT: well to be fair I played against bots that go into mines a lot less than lower down the ladder&#160;;)
 MSmits: anyway, gotta go walk the dog, thanks for the stats eulerscheZahl, it's really cool
 MSmits: YannT yeah thats true
 Rprades: hi, quick question. I finished 2 puzzles but i did not get the exp. Is there any problem? Or what am I missing? thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: how could i miss the fact that you have a dog?
 MSmits: i dunno, talked about her before
 AntiSquid: he keeps mentioning his dog
 MSmits: she's crazy and attacks people and other animals
 MSmits: we keep her on a short leash
 Astrobytes: You own a hellhound?
 MSmits: anyway, i'll have stories another time, gotta go (yes she thinks she is a hellhound, but shes just a little dog)
 AntiSquid: hey Rprades go here and click on your level, see what it says, if xp is really missing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/home">https://www.codingame.com/home</a>
 MSmits: ttyl
 Astrobytes: Aha, small dog syndrome
 Astrobytes: ttyl
 wlesavo: YannT i feel like if you would take my path estimation it would make quite a good bot actually
 YannT: it would be really easy to replace my crap scoring for position value with something else too&#160;:)
 YannT: pathing really was my anchor, I dunno why I didn't feel like going with something else before it was too late, I kinda got tunnel vision on this :p
 icecream17: ok im back
 icecream17: also, about the teacher thing, i have 7 classes.
 wlesavo: but eval part looks quite good, maybe ill try to implement something similar
 YannT: it's really what got me to where I am tbh
 Kukiss: Hi all
 wlesavo: it takes a specific way of thinking which i dont have yet but want to practice
 YannT: other than that my tracking is good, but as good as everybody elese's, and my pathing is clearly subpar
 Kukiss: I don't know if any1 asked it already wlesavo, but is there maybe any post mortem coming?I am really curious how you managed the data to be competitive using Python..
 wlesavo: YannT opposite for me, it seems that i got carried by pathing
 YannT: I would very accurately estimate mine positions etc, but only 4 tiles around my position at end of turn
 YannT: and that was clearly not enough
 wlesavo: Kukiss there is one already in the forum
 wlesavo: so you didnt have whole damage map?
 YannT: I did
 YannT: but I only analyzed 4 moves deep
 wlesavo: oh i read wrong
 YannT: when my bot had to "take a turn" (i.e go into one sea or another with no possibility of going back other than surface), and one choice would lead it to a minefield and death
 Kukiss: oh, I did not notice. Thanks
 YannT: if it was more than 5 tiles away it wouldn't see
 YannT: it would pick based on "well there's no mines around and there more space so I'mma go there"
 YannT: no notion of "yeah, but there's mines you can't avoid just 5 turns later"
 YannT: I read in one guy's PM about giving more weight to already visited tiles
 YannT: probably shouldn't have done that
 YannT: although it would've compounded the "my bot doesn't handle surface loops very well either" problem
 wlesavo: i think random path works the same in the close region, but also accounts for floodfill to the length it can reach and cummulative damage is helpful to estimate if you wanna surface already
 YannT: yeah but you're gonna force more surface on yourself (or choose to go into mines) when you don't necessarily have to is what I'm saying
 YannT: if there's 100 tiles on one side and 101 tiles on the other +50 mines but there's a few tiles away, it's gonna go towards mine and eat a surface when it gets close to them
 wlesavo: not what i meant, if you have valid path of sertain length you doont need the actuall flood fill, max length is reached, so thats enough already, then just estimate damage on path by summing up with a discount
 YannT: oh yeah
 YannT: basically any other path evaluation is probably better than what I've got
 icecream17: ooh. back to the code
 MichaelPu: you could add a discount for mined tiles in the floodfill
 YannT: I tried that but performance was horrible
 YannT: but I thought about it after there were ways to implement it in such a way that the performance would be acceptable
 YannT: was too late tho&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: as we talked about kawano's blog yesterday: val growth streaming (recording from earlier the day) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitcasting.tv/valgrowth/show/">https://twitcasting.tv/valgrowth/show/</a>

 zurakin: live?
 AntiSquid: so we can't join?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what the URL is
 AntiSquid: "The challenge is only accessible to 42 students." from twitter :D
 AntiSquid: VIP only rofl
 MSmits: actually it's not 42
 MSmits: the network is called 42
 MSmits: and they have many more students
 AntiSquid: oh ok
 Astrobytes: Hm,  Ionly know Network 23
 MSmits: maybe 42network is studying the question to the answer to life the universe and everything
 Nerchio: yeah i read somewhere that there is 2 private contests going on right now or something
 MSmits: thats how cg makes money to keep going
 MSmits: sometimes those company sponsored contests are open to all
 MSmits: they never give you codingpoint ranking btw
 MSmits: but you do get xp
 AntiSquid: maybe just the meaning of life during university years :p
 eulerscheZahl: who cares, we want tshirts
 MSmits: ah yes, I forgot your clothing situation
 AntiSquid: but MSmits it's free for schools i think
 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: maybe they don't want the students wrecked
 MSmits: makes sense
 Nerchio: haha lol
 Astrobytes: I liked the days we could hijack semi-private contests
 MSmits: euler finds the secret links
 Astrobytes: *used to
 Astrobytes: But they removed them from the page source iirc
 MSmits: probably best
 Astrobytes: For them perhaps, what about us?! :P
 MSmits: i mean if we're not supposed to wreck the students we shouldnt :P
 MSmits: we got plenty to do&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: nerchio is a student though, he could still wreck them maybe? nerchio can you join it?
 Nerchio: idk i dont think so
 reCurse: Since when are we not supposed to wreck students
 reCurse: How else will they learn
 AntiSquid: best life lesson
 Nerchio: when you click join it makes you join a campus ;p
 MSmits: ahh, you opened my eyes reCurse, now I see what i have been doing wrong in my job :P
 MSmits: it needs more wrecking
 AntiSquid: organize cg contest at your school MSmits
 Nerchio: there is a guy in C# in top3 of that contest
 MSmits: it's a good idea, but we only just got started with our CS curriculum
 Nerchio: so yeah
 MSmits: my colleague started teaching them java in 4th year and they have 2 more years of coding after
 eulerscheZahl: leaderboard link?

 MSmits: definitely more than 42
 Nerchio: if you had an email from one of those cities/campuses
 Nerchio: i think you could join

 Nerchio: yea i mean i wrote 42 network cg in google and it came up
 Nerchio: wasnt that hard to find lol
 MSmits: recurse, quick, dump your NN on there
 ZarthaxX: he would crush them all
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 AntiSquid: wait it's until 21st April?
 YannT: MSmits: actually CG mostly makes money by providing recruitment tests
 MSmits: oh ok
 AntiSquid: it's different from the actual game MSmits ZarthaxX
 reCurse: You prevented me from completing it MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: and a laptop for the winner :o
 MSmits: ack... i did not pull you back into uttt did i? Or was it oware?
 reCurse: oware
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: well thats fine, it's a NN at least
 Nerchio: its the squiditch game
 Nerchio: or whatever
 AntiSquid: yes
 Nerchio: you can watch battles
 YannT: it's like a multiple choice test, and also there's code questions that kinda use the same platform as the public game, but then they send you a report of how the candidate did, with snapshots of his code through time and stuff
 AntiSquid: Nerchio it's Fantastic Bits
 YannT: that's their "pro" offer for earning money&#160;:)
 Nerchio: yea i know dont want to play that tbh
 Nerchio: i stay away from vectors from now
 AntiSquid: what you gonna do then
 Nerchio: for *
 YannT: and it's actually great when you wanna recruit dev, you just send them the link and it makes for a great first screening
 Nerchio: i am trying ghost in a cell i think
 MSmits: yeah, it gives you something to talk about during the interview also
 Nerchio: but so far reading input got me ^.^
 Astrobytes: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work">https://www.codingame.com/work</a>
 Astrobytes: Also I think they did a blog article on it
 AntiSquid: you got ooc legend, everything else should be easy
 MSmits: i remember reading that
 MSmits: Astrobytes
 MSmits: didnt know most of the money was from recruitment tests
 darkhorse64: apart from the spells, it does not look that different
 Nerchio: no antisquid i think other challenges look harder lol :p
 AntiSquid: you didn't spend a month on them
 AntiSquid: did you
 MSmits: ow, there's a little yellow bot thingy talking to me on cg work. Did AutomatonNN make a baby?
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem?
 Nerchio: antisquid i spend 10 days on ooc not a month ;D
 MSmits: no no, no problem
 AntiSquid: ya what's your problem you racist?
 YannT: they even have a visio interview thing as part of their "pro" offering now so you can do remote interviews
 AntiSquid: bot hater
 MSmits: :P
 eulerscheZahl: you can click on the nodes to see the matches
 AntiSquid: then maybe that's your kind of game nerchio

 MSmits: ok so you win the contest and then try to find an alternate ranking
 MSmits: makes no sense, interesting stuff though&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: "he was expected to win"you want to trigger the gender nazis, don't you? :D
 Nerchio: he won and he wants to see if he also won in all alternate universes
 MSmits: mmh i think you calling them nazis might trigger the gender nazis :P
 MSmits: oops
 MSmits: now i did it too!
 Nerchio: i was expecting msmits to be top5 with alternate ranking
 Nerchio: but turns out no
 MSmits: where am i at
 Nerchio: idk i dont see you
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm on spot with 28th
 Nerchio: around 25
 Nerchio: i think
 Nerchio: msmits
 MSmits: yeah where to see
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-alternate-ranking/176074">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ocean-of-code-alternate-ranking/176074</a>
 Nerchio: last pic?
 YannT: I'm still #11 and no top10 achievement, alternate ranking fake news
 cegprakash: ocean of code is back??
 cegprakash: yet?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Nerchio: ye
 MSmits:  I know why trictrac beat zenoscave 88% instead of 53%
 YannT: yes
 eulerscheZahl: timeouts?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: his both was worse  than yours
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: on timeouting
 MSmits: that is
 cegprakash: how I'm already on silver
 eulerscheZahl: zeno, chucknorris and me collected them, true
 cegprakash: auto submit?
 eulerscheZahl: final contest leaderboard was copied
 cegprakash: and I see all my history from the contest
 cegprakash: wow
 cegprakash: interesting idea
 cegprakash: thanks CG
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: that's why I was surprised in UTG today
 cegprakash: when I opened crystal rush
 cegprakash: and saw my bot already on gold
 YannT: no more double dipping on XP though
 cegprakash: what sad
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: that was my hope to hold my  lead
 MSmits: fine with me, xp is not meant for that
 YannT: resubmiting my contest bots into the multis and leaving them there was my bread and butter  :(
 reCurse: People still caring about xp
 reCurse: wat
 YannT: I deserve to be golden
 eulerscheZahl: we can't max-out on XP anymore
 AntiSquid: where you doing all the jap AI stuff from eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: digging *
 AntiSquid: where are you digging it from
 eulerscheZahl: to whom are you talking?
 AntiSquid: you
 AntiSquid: you found bunch of links
 Astrobytes: You've triggered squid's inner weeb
 eulerscheZahl: CG twitch
 eulerscheZahl: twitter*
 eulerscheZahl: and the in-game leaderboard for games like 4 player CSB
 AntiSquid: better a weeb than anglophile in times like these
 eulerscheZahl: (that was id=1)
 reCurse: twit casting lol
 Astrobytes: true AntiSquid
 reCurse: Bless their innocence
 Astrobytes: "twit casting" just that phrase makes my teeth itch
 <b>**MSmits is googling "weeb"</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: oh that again
 Astrobytes: What did you google before? Waifu?
 AntiSquid: MSmits watch out you have a lot of exposure to that lately and it's contagious
 MSmits: nah AntiSquid shared a yt about some guy marrying an anime hologram
 AntiSquid: maybe you got the weeb flu already, should self isolate
 MSmits: think he was a uber-weeb
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah that was it. He married his cuddly toy waifu....
 eulerscheZahl: and we have another multiplayer pending
 Astrobytes: It's not contagious, it's fairly repellant :P
 reCurse: stahp
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Conway's
 MSmits: tulips and daisies 3p&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: as 2 player
 MSmits: whats that?
 eulerscheZahl: looks like "game of life and death" from riddles
 eulerscheZahl: wait, it's 4 players
 MSmits: wow
 Astrobytes: 4 players...
 MSmits: at some point they will need to make subcategories for multis
 AntiSquid: hey MSmits change avatar <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4c/aa/f7/4caaf7c49df86fbaef6f9019d9cb4b9a.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4c/aa/f7/4caaf7c49df86fbaef6f9019d9cb4b9a.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: You have some kind of avatar fixation squiddy?
 AntiSquid: no
 icecream17: =) don't know why that was...
 MSmits: he's just a weeb for physics professor anime
 AntiSquid: just offering MSmits an anime alternative
 Astrobytes: Always telling people to get an avatar or recommending one
 MSmits: i like the pic AntiSquid, but its not good for small size
 AntiSquid: oh i have a fixation for avatarless folks i guess
 Astrobytes: Admittedly that's quite a decent one
 AntiSquid: see Astrobytes? he likes it
 Astrobytes: So do I!
 Astrobytes: Just use the head MSmits
 AntiSquid: ya looks funny, hair waving 
 AntiSquid: you can crop when you upload
 MSmits: meh I am too attached to my current avatar
 MSmits: It looks more like me than your pic
 MSmits: more glasses, less hair :P
 Astrobytes: I have never known any physics professor with hair
 MSmits: mmh my colleagues have hair mostly
 MSmits: on their head even
 Astrobytes: Yeah? REmarkable
 Astrobytes: I find biologists have the most hair
 Astrobytes: on their heads
 MSmits: sure, they know how it grows
 AntiSquid: like where else would you see their hair growng from MSmits
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: i don't know AntiSquid, I just hypothesized it
 AntiSquid: become an experimental physicist
 MSmits: hah I am very far from that
 MSmits: in my physics group, I am always the theory guy, we have another physicist that is great at experimental stuff
 Astrobytes:  Does he have hair?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: he's older than me and has more hair
 Astrobytes: Ergo, theoretical physics causes baldness
 AntiSquid: ok question, why isn't tesla more popular
 MSmits: think maybe you did some p-hacking there
 MSmits: nothing wrong with tesla
 Astrobytes: :D
 wlesavo: i know many physicists with hair, some of them teaching
 MSmits: glad you're butting in on this very mature subject also wlesavo :P
 reCurse: Rumors say MSmits switched to IT to prevent losing hair
 MSmits: my IT colleague does also have more hair...
 Astrobytes: Case closed
 AntiSquid: but einstein had more hair than your profile picture
 MSmits: well i never said that my profile pic was Einstein
 MSmits: that is your assumption
 AntiSquid: who does it represent&#160;?&#160;:/
 MSmits: me
 AntiSquid: you bleached your hair?
 MSmits: no, it's symbolic
 Astrobytes: Do you have a 'tache like that tho?
 MSmits: nah that's also symbolic
 AntiSquid: blue top&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Symbolic of what, exactly?
 AntiSquid: his stando
 MSmits: what's a stando?
 Astrobytes: stando?
 MSmits: it's not anime related again is it?
 AntiSquid: google it MSmits
 reCurse: It is
 Astrobytes: The lockdown is pushing squido into full weeb
 AntiSquid: obviously your avatar is performing the battle stance
 MSmits: ahh ok sure, stando works
 reCurse: That doesn't look like a stando at all though
 MSmits: maybe that's the idea
 MSmits: it's failed stando
 MSmits: reCurse, you arent still working on oware are you?
 reCurse: No
 Astrobytes: Stop swearing MSmits
 MSmits: what is your project now, if you want to share?
 reCurse: No project
 MSmits: no multi, no nn etc.?
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: busy with work then?
 Astrobytes: Just gaming or life stuff?
 darkhorse64: MSmits: come rekt karliso on Onitama
 MSmits: or right, reCurse still games
 MSmits: darkhorse64 I am working on it
 MSmits: I got a state representation that fits in 64 bit&#160;:)
 reCurse: Yeah I guess
 AntiSquid: too MSmits karliso got bored and quit CG while waiting
 AntiSquid: too late *
 AntiSquid: damn it, i am eating up words
 Astrobytes: reCurse your mojo will return
 MSmits: hehe yeah, I have no idea how long i'll be at onitama either. Just want to get it working. If it's good and i know an eval that works well.  I'll stick around longer
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUJCNoLmRO4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUJCNoLmRO4</a>
 MSmits: trying to convert to a good card system now, I can fit it in 5 bit
 MSmits: but it's not easy
 Astrobytes: Yeah not that mojo
 darkhorse64: 64 bits including the cars&#160;?
 MSmits: including
 darkhorse64: cards
 MSmits: 25 bits for all positions, 3 bits per master, totals 56 bit, 1 bit for the turn, 7 bits left, I need 5 for the cards, so 2 bits left
 reCurse: What is this, the 70s
 MSmits: 62 out of 64, good deal&#160;:)
 MSmits: hey it's nice, if i want to use maps and sets i can use a 64 bit key :0
 Astrobytes: I'm off to work on my optimised punchcards
 MSmits: hf&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: what?
 Astrobytes: I'm joking ffs
 AntiSquid: sure
 Nerchio: wtf haha
 Nerchio: i keep getting games only against amurushkin in ooc xD
 Nerchio: ~288 games 
 Nerchio: ah i guess maybe he is working on his bot and submitting
 Nerchio: so its the same for others too
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: it's just you
 Nerchio: ;o
 wala: Nerchio you were 41 this morning and now you're 13&#160;???
 Nerchio: yea bugged
 Nerchio: i have 288 games vs one player&#160;:)
 cegprakash: when should I use silence? when enemy can track me well?
 Nerchio: yes
 Nerchio: or sometimes after you shoot
 Nerchio: or some other options as well
 cegprakash: my rand() always returns the same values (same cycles). All my games run on the same server?
 Nerchio: do you guys remember the name of the plugin that could run the games and see the stats
 Astrobytes: either brutaltester or cgbenchmark, depending if you want to test vs yourself (former) or a selection of players (the latter)
 Nerchio: there was one for webbrowser
 Astrobytes: cgspunk?
 Nerchio: ye probably thsis one
 Astrobytes: That doesn't work now
 Nerchio: ah&#160;:(
 Nerchio: i am crushing wood3 in ghost in the cell
 Nerchio: most of the bots dont do anything xD
 aCat: that's wood
 aCat: what did you expect :P
 Nerchio: i was getting crushed in legend ooc so it feels good to win :D
 SatoshiNakamoto: Hi
 Nerchio: but wood2 is giving my 5 min alghoritm some trouble
 cegprakash: cgspunk is bugged I think
 Nerchio:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: it never worked for me
 cegprakash: I installed it for the BATCH RUN feature
 cegprakash: but except that all other features work fine
 cegprakash: but those are cool features too
 cegprakash: u can try it
 cegprakash: it's a chrome extension
 Astrobytes: You need CGBenchmark for runs against a set of opponents now
 Astrobytes: (or your own tool)
 Nerchio: does it use server power?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, so did CGSpunk
 Astrobytes: So there's a delay between requests
 Nerchio: but if everybody used that it wouldn't be so good :D
 aCat: yeah, cg spunk is not working for me&#160;:(
 aCat: Is something wrong with it globally?
 Astrobytes: It just wasn't updated to reflect the CG API changes aCat
 aCat: ah, ok, that's sad&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: CGBenchmark is cool tho, just a bit less 'plg 'n' play'&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: *plug
 Nerchio: if it doesnt overload servers then i will probably use it next time
 Nerchio: its not the one where you need to write the referee is it?
 Nerchio: xD
 Astrobytes: Nerchio<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark/blob/master/README.md</a>
 Nerchio: ok nice will be easier to debug ^^
 cegprakash: is there anyone in legend who don't use mines and sonars?
 cegprakash: because I'm committing on this strat
 Swagboy: No
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: at least no mines?
 Nerchio: i dont use sonars in legen
 Nerchio: but mine is neccessary xD
 cegprakash: sonar is easy to code
 cegprakash: I can take it from my wood1 bot
 cegprakash: but mine I've no idea where to place
 Nerchio: everywhere
 cegprakash: :O
 cegprakash: but opponent will know u placing
 cegprakash: whats the point
 cegprakash: better to charge something else
 cegprakash:&#160;?
 cegprakash: when u charge a mine
 Nerchio: all the time 
 cegprakash: u can only charge 1 skill at a turn
 Nerchio: torpedo first always
 Nerchio: then mine/silence as you choose
 cegprakash: how u choose?
 cegprakash: unless u predict next 6 moves
 cegprakash: between mine and silence
 cegprakash: coz u take 6 turns to charge a silence
 Nerchio: i like to have silence ready
 cegprakash: I'm right now wasting a lot of silences
 cegprakash: I need to find some logic when I should avoid casting silence
 cegprakash: so that I can save mana for mine or sonar
 MSmits: mana? 
 Astrobytes: energy/charge
 MSmits: ah... well it's a good thing he's not casting spells from his sub then
 Nerchio: wood1 ghost in the cell
 Nerchio: hype xd
 Astrobytes: flipendo
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: gz Nerchio
 Astrobytes: nice Nerchio
 Nerchio: damn wood1 has some tough competition
 Nerchio: will have to tackle it tomorrow
 cegprakash: does anyone choose spawn location based on myId? say spawn in the center if first player or spawn in corner if second player to be defensive
 tekki: hallo world!
 tekki: AutomatonNN advice?
 AutomatonNN: can someone help me with the code that i did in javascript and javascript code is community puzzle a
 TrentT: Can you link the code?
 tekki: hmm me mo&#160;:)
 tekki: Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i don't even know how to do it on the forum
 tekki:&#160;:) good boy
 tekki: Automaton2000 can you link the code? please
 Automaton2000: damn i just found a bug in my code.
 Kelvz: this's good
 TrentT: Welcome to the club
 tekki: so Automaton2000 can you link your code?
 Automaton2000: im not gonna do that
 tekki: why&#160;? Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: anyone knows if there is one
 tekki: and? Automatmon2000?
 tekki: and? Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: depends on what i should do something
 tekki: can AutomatonNN link the code Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: do you guys think of the contest
 AutomatonNN: with a that strategy
 Nerchio: so in bronze usually all things are unlocked right?
 reCurse: Not always, but for recent games yes
 Nerchio: Starting from the bronze league, you can increase the production rate of your factories.This is the last rule change.
 Nerchio: nice
 Nerchio: so with minimal code i got to all the rules now i can start thinking about strategy :p
 Nerchio: damn Unleash the geek looks fun as well
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: u seem so excited
 Nerchio: ye i like coding bots :D
 cegprakash: me debugging at Silver
 cegprakash: i'm wondering how gold boss works
 cegprakash: sorry silve rboss
 cegprakash: it prints my exact position at turn 20. That's the 10th turn for him 
 cegprakash: that too before dealing any damage or receiving any damage
 cegprakash: it prints my position in the message
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453504660">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453504660</a>
 cegprakash: please check turn 20
 vbplaya: cegprakash, I cant watch the replay for some reason.
 cegprakash: it works in private windo for me
 cegprakash: plz try in private window
 tomatoes: shooting without damage reduce possible positions too
 cegprakash: interesting
 cegprakash: I need to add that
 cegprakash: thanks tomatoes
 cegprakash: so my torpedo target should also be optimal
 cegprakash: damn
 cegprakash: this is fun
 cegprakash: my tracking is wrong when both players damage each other
 cegprakash: interesting
 cegprakash: that too when enemy uses torpedo on himself
 cegprakash: just so he can hit me as well
 cegprakash: opponent guesses my position accurately at 30th turn without using any skills at all.
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453529369">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453529369</a>
 cegprakash: how is this even possible
 ZarthaxX: u have bad movement?
 cegprakash: check replay
 cegprakash: it's not bad
 ZarthaxX: he just shot you at the very end
 ZarthaxX: in your exact tile
 ZarthaxX: im confused
 cegprakash: no he shot after he decided
 ZarthaxX: mhm?
 ZarthaxX: what frame
 cegprakash: turn 30 see MSG printed by boss
 cegprakash: on right side above the cooldowns
 cegprakash: it says "11 3 or 1"
 ZarthaxX: and the 1
 ZarthaxX: means yours?
 cegprakash: yeah
 ZarthaxX: well
 cegprakash: at the start of the game the possibilities are large
 ZarthaxX: take into account that the moment you shoot
 cegprakash: it shrinks to 1
 ZarthaxX: you sold yourself a lot
 ZarthaxX: yeah well they shrink hwere basically coz of your movement and torpedo shot
 cegprakash: I soold nothing
 ZarthaxX: your movement generates invalid tiles for later on
 ZarthaxX: that discards a lot
 ZarthaxX: when u torpedo you reveal yourself a lot too
 cegprakash: I never shot him
 ZarthaxX: frame 29
 cegprakash: not at 30th turn
 ZarthaxX: u shot somewhere
 ZarthaxX: then he shot you
 cegprakash: it did not damage him
 ZarthaxX: no
 ZarthaxX: but you shot
 cegprakash: so what
 ZarthaxX: he saw where you shot
 cegprakash: no
 ZarthaxX: he can discard options
 cegprakash: he can't do that
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: yes
 ZarthaxX: you get enemy torpedo position
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 cegprakash: what he knows my torpedo position
 cegprakash: wtf
 cegprakash: wew
 ZarthaxX: read the rules plz
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 ZarthaxX: u could have got gold
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 cegprakash: out off all the things to track
 cegprakash: this is the most crucial one
 cegprakash: and I didn't do it
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ZarthaxX: yep
 TrentT: ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)
 cegprakash: thanks for fixing the table TrentT
 cegprakash: I will fix my code tomorrow
 cegprakash: I mean tonight..
 cegprakash: why am I going to sleep at 7:30 AM
 cegprakash: I am being paid
 cegprakash: zz
 ZarthaxX: lmao

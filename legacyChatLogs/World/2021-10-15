 codeing: Wontonimo why are you telling it not possible
 codeing: the code is maybe complex but all tests case pass
 Wontonimo: awesome!
 Wontonimo: I was wrong
 Wontonimo: sorry
 ProCoder03: Good morning&#160;!!
 Wontonimo: :wave: Programer171
 Wontonimo: :wave: ProCoder03
 codeing: lets chat in private
 Wontonimo: eulerscheZahl , have you noticed that all the pgoramming language levels you had in your profile are now gone?
 Wontonimo: I worked on a bunch of those levels and today they have been erased
 Wontonimo: that's kinda sad
 Mundgus: The levels are gone, butif you move your cursor to any language icon, you can see the number of solved puzzles
 Wontonimo: nope, nothing is showing for me
 Wontonimo: it just says to discover my skill
 Wontonimo: i already know my skill
 Wontonimo: :unamused:
 ProCoder03: yeah, now you have do some sort of screening test
 Husoski: Hey Wontonimo...what's that about CG getting sold?
 Mundgus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/YZgMUGkRO4rU.png">https://pasteboard.co/YZgMUGkRO4rU.png</a>
 ProCoder03: Yesterday it got sold to Coderpad.io 
 Husoski: Is that good news or bad?
 ProCoder03: Only time can tell...
 Wontonimo: Mundgus, my UI does't look like that
 Husoski: FWIW, the coding levels are (mostly) still there under achievements...but the extra award for 30 solutions disappeared from there.
 Mundgus: Wow, I don't know, why&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: i don't have 333 puzzles solved
 Wontonimo: more like 40 for each language
 ProCoder03: First of all, does CG has 333 puzzles&#160;??
 Boruto-kun: hi guys, im just curious.
 ProCoder03: abt wht&#160;??
 Boruto-kun: is anyone here doing jobs from clash code?
 Husoski: CoC isn't really a job skill.  Winning there almost always involves junky techniques that I'd never use in a professional context.
 eulerscheZahl: Wontonimo 06:06AMeulerscheZahl , have you noticed that all the pgoramming language levels you had in your profile are now gone?
 eulerscheZahl: yes I noticed. But I don't intend to do anything about it
 eulerscheZahl: looks like employment theory for me to update that list
 eulerscheZahl: same for skills and certifications
 Wontonimo: when did this change? 
 eulerscheZahl: a few days ago
 eulerscheZahl: but afk now. breakfast, then work
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Wontonimo: Husoski, i can see the number complete on other peoples profile, just not mine&#160;!  
 Husoski: Interesting...that means I need a sock account just to keep tabs on the real one?
 Husoski: I don't see any puzzle counts on your profile, though, so maybe something else is going on?  Where should I look other than the main /profile page?
 Wontonimo: idk
 ProCoder03: visit your profile page from an incognito tab
 Wontonimo: :astonished:
 Wontonimo: :wink:
 Wontonimo: well, i'm pretty tired and i have a mouse in the house that i've gottta take care of.  later :wave:
 ProCoder03: you still haven't got rid of the mouse 
 ProCoder03:&#160;???
 Husoski: Still not seeing any puzzle counts anywhere (other than at least 15 to get the red badge).
 Husoski: Oh...there they are...on the hover popup.

 Thorcode: I don't know java
 Thorcode:&#160;:(
 S3D1: i dont know python
 S3D1: :disappointed:
 Thorcode: idk
 Thorcode: the clash of areslane only allow java
 Thorcode: so I say that bro
 S3D1: if you know any language java is easy to learn
 Thorcode: so I tell him that
 S3D1: no you have to learn it
 S3D1: dummi
 Thorcode: why
 SunnySuperstar_a06d: Hi everybody
 Thorcode: you serious I have to learn Java
 S3D1: idk know what clash of areslane is i started yesterday with that game
 SunnySuperstar_a06d: If any one wants to learn React.js or want to becom gis developer
 SunnySuperstar_a06d: I can teach them free
 Thorcode: nice
 Thorcode: your level only 1 SunnySuperstar_a06d 
 SunnySuperstar_a06d: I just joined this site
 Thorcode: well rank up bro
 SunnySuperstar_a06d: Why that's important
 Thorcode: I don't thing that I can trust a level 1

 VizGhar: Hey guys&#160;:) Just going through MIT performance presentations and I've noticed typedef struct bit fields (wasn't aware of that before)
 derjack: hello
 darkhorse64: The compiler pads your struct to the nearest boundary but it is way better to do it yourself just for the sake of being able to initialize unused bits. I am not aware of any slow downs. I have use bitfields for Onitama or FC2020 and it looks good to me although it did not benchmark against an implementation with int64, masks and shifts. It certainly makes your code clearer 
 derjack: will you use them in FC2021 though
 darkhorse64: will I ever use it in the future&#160;?
 derjack: not in CG future eh
 darkhorse64: I will not speculate on corporate decisions
 derjack: corporate? we are big family
 darkhorse64: Not the same family
 darkhorse64: Not just one family

 Astrobytes: who's on your team euler?
 struct: been a while since i did those
 eulerscheZahl: dready, zeno, blaise
 eulerscheZahl: The5Percent
 Astrobytes: ah right, yeah zeno said he was doing it along with blaise, didn't realise it was your team
 eulerscheZahl: well, it is. kudos for the teamname to zeno
 Astrobytes: Yeah, great name! good luck with it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and also for the blaise nomination. i will kick both is we don't perform :imp:
 eulerscheZahl: if*
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 TheBlueBias: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how well you know dready. he's the one who broke the initial number shifting version by reversing the map generator seed
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I don't know him to speak to much but am familiar
 eulerscheZahl: likes to break stuff and bypass security measures. or automate captcha solving
 eulerscheZahl: we send DMs occasionally
 Astrobytes: useful team member indeed
 eulerscheZahl: also: hmehta is quitting at topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: it's their Thibaud equivalent
 Astrobytes: yeah I know the name, reason?

 eulerscheZahl: there is a "why" paragraph but I failed to extract the reason from it
 struct: well probably wasnt enjoying it anymore and wants to try something else
 Astrobytes: he's leaving to be senior community manager at another dev community
 eulerscheZahl: didn't even say the name
 Astrobytes: "Now to learn more and try new things, I am heading to manage a developer community as the Senior Community Manager, concentrating on initiatives such as user groups, building their local communities, and outreach."
 eulerscheZahl: i read that,yes
 Astrobytes: So it's probably better money, more opportunities, more interesting etc
 MiyamuraIzumi: hello guys
 Astrobytes: Just wait and see if he pops up again somewhere else, if not I'm sure it'll get around
 eulerscheZahl: really surprised me when I read it. for me he was the personalized topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder in person. that sounds better
 Astrobytes: *Personification of
 JBM: sounds better, misleads better too :D
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 ProCoder03: can we solo in reply challenge&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: team of 2-4
 Astrobytes: Yeah, like I said, must be a much better offer, or he's just bored/stagnating
 Uljahn: might be recruited by Coderpad :smirk:
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 eulerscheZahl: oh, some activity on discord stream. i thought it was on twitch?
 Astrobytes: hm?
 Astrobytes: Oh wait I see it
 struct: whats happening on discord?
 Astrobytes: Yeah they said twitch yesterday

 eulerscheZahl: i know
 TheBlueBias: I'm a french user
 raizbro: where the secret put
 TheBlueBias: :p
 raizbro: maybe like somthing
 eulerscheZahl: github even sent me an automated mail when I committed that secret
 struct: nice
 eulerscheZahl: but I don't care as I don't have any user logins in my DB
 raizbro: where the secret come from
 raizbro: what Db

 eulerscheZahl: it's the source code of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: minus the puzzle update script
 raizbro: ok
 raizbro: so
 raizbro: first secret
 raizbro: Dr_monkey user name
 raizbro: real
 raizbro: all
 raizbro: 29 has secret
 raizbro: ok
 Wontonimo: no spamming raizbro
 Wontonimo: having my progress taken away (even if it is still there but just hidden) is demotivating.  My languages levels now show up as "unknown level".  Taking away fake internet points is poop
 eulerscheZahl: might get another update
 eulerscheZahl: check forum
 eulerscheZahl: also, on todays episode on random CG facts: did you know that you can read the chat without being logged in?
 Ran_42: how can you do that?
 struct: o.o
 Astrobytes: Step 1: log out
 Ran_42: :p
 eulerscheZahl: open a replay in a new tab. then use the top navigation to go somewhere else like the forum
 eulerscheZahl: a chat will open

 eulerscheZahl: nice
 Wontonimo: i can't hear anything either
 derjack: :older_man:

 ProCoder03: my eyes hurt
 Astrobytes: streaming live from a potato
 derjack: from CG server*
 Ran_42: lol
 struct: lol
 struct: coderpad is also streaming
 struct: also muted
 struct:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: also 328p?
 Astrobytes: is it higher res?
 Wontonimo: *technical issues from coding site*
 struct: 720
 struct: both have sound now
 ProCoder03: mine is still in 328p...
 Wontonimo: and some of the sound is looping and delayed by a few seconds
 Ran_42: I still got 328p
 eulerscheZahl: i see they know the CG website my heart already
 eulerscheZahl: by

 BlackDragonGaming: THE WOT
 BlackDragonGaming: wut
 BlackDragonGaming: The Clash of Code is a bit hard
 _NikJ: You just gotta get used to it
 chin_utd: hi everyone (:
 MIPSTER: peen
 Astrobytes: MIPSTER: first warning
 eulerscheZahl: the question: will the see the oddities of UTF8 now? My money is on python winning
 Astrobytes: oh, I hadn't checked the clash, was listening but didn't see
 eulerscheZahl: golf and not a completely trivial one. so it will go over 50 chars
 Astrobytes: yeah, not gonna be particularly short solutions
 eulerscheZahl: this binary encoding will be a great showcase of the platform :rofl:
 Westicles: binary encoded ruby is usually better
 Astrobytes: lol
 Uljahn: solved with numpy, then bianry encoded, should i share the solution? :smiley:
 Uljahn: *binary
 eulerscheZahl: r=range and then not using r :D
 Scarfield: implied intellect
 Astrobytes: i know right :rofl:
 Astrobytes: he had plenty time to find-replace that before the end
 Astrobytes: Uljahn: YES!!!
 Uljahn: ok
 eulerscheZahl: uljahn have you shared?
 Uljahn: ye
 eulerscheZahl: with UTF8?
 eulerscheZahl: cant see as i didn't play
 Uljahn: plain solution was:import numpy as n;[print(*r) for r in n.array([input().split()for i in range(9)]).reshape(3,3,3,3).swapaxes(1,2).reshape(9,9)]
 Uljahn: LOL
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: nice
 Uljahn: :muscle:
 eulerscheZahl: well played
 Astrobytes: definitely
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 lukaster:     ()
 darkhorse64: when i see Uljahn solution, I know why I should never ever play Coc
 eulerscheZahl: a reverse one. meanwhile in my log files:

 eulerscheZahl: IP seems from Vienna, Austria
 jacek: you should shut down the website :imp:
 struct: make it return a random clash&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i always knew it's a dual use thing&#160;:(
 MeBen: @eulerscheZahl That was me&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i see, gotcha
 MeBen: I had a decent idea what it was but not enough to find a solution, didn't realize it was a phone thing
 eulerscheZahl: did you find the clash?
 MeBen: Yeah
 Westicles: ha, I should be there too
 eulerscheZahl: btw we already have 2 new mods on discord. more people to ping with @staff when the chat died again&#160;:)
 struct: only on discord?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: s/mods/staff
 [CG]Thibaud: it was easier for the permission of the vocal channel
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not complaining, I like pinging users :imp:
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl

 Moodyz: hey
 Moodyz: just joined , haven't read much unfortunately about it, is it worth the time for actually learning&#160;?
 Astrobytes: the site assumes a basic working knowledge of a language, so not for complete beginners
 Astrobytes: It's good for learning though, through practice and challenging oneself
 Moodyz: great , im not looking for complete beginners thing
 Moodyz: appreciate the time to reply! thanks
 eulerscheZahl: reply starts in 17min
 Astrobytes: No worries, there are puzzles, multiplayer bot programming, optims and clashes
 Astrobytes: and code golf
 Astrobytes: good luck eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 BlackDragonGaming: Can you freely code on this website?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 BlackDragonGaming: Okay... how do I do that?

 BlackDragonGaming: Iwonder if there is a Super Mario thing on here XD
 jacek: unlikely
 Moodyz: what's the best game to play here y'all from your personal exp&#160;?
 Astrobytes: that's highly subjective
 jacek: :notebook:
 Astrobytes: ...
 Moodyz: well you are 100% right , its more like what do you guys recommend starting with
 Astrobytes: There are board games, maze-type games, physics-based games
 Astrobytes: In all honesty I would just go through the list and check them out, see which one you find the most interesting
 Moodyz: agree , that was a really unessercery  question haha
 Astrobytes: nah, don't worry, it's just a very open ended question with a lot of varying answers :P
 Moodyz: thanks, ill stick to the quest map and do them all
 Moodyz: gotta catch em all "Pokemon"
 Astrobytes: As I usually say, if you start on something and don't like it, move to another one and do that instead

 TimothyAlexisVass: Moodyz
 Astrobytes: right?
 struct: is it fine to use unordered_map for TT?
 struct: or is it too slow?
 Astrobytes: you caaaan but it depends how performant you need it to be
 TimothyAlexisVass: These are easy to start with: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56dc8d59-53cc-4655-a3f0-368608845142">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/56dc8d59-53cc-4655-a3f0-368608845142</a>
 struct: I think ill try to make it work on loa first
 struct: then ill try to add TT's on C4
 Astrobytes: mcts?
 struct: yes
 struct: but loa will probably be minimax
 Astrobytes: I have zero experience using TTs with mcts
 jacek: i use unordered_map for TT
 jacek: im too dumb to write something better
 jacek: or that hash thing table from that c4 solver would be faster

 struct: I tried that I had too many collisions on loa
 struct: for some reason
 struct: the key&#160;% size
 struct: would be different from the key that was actually stored in that index
 Astrobytes: perhaps your replacement strategy?
 jacek: of course you need to check what exactly is in that entry
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: so your hash wasnt hashy enough
 Astrobytes: and you can have multiple buckets or just one
 jacek: TT greatly speeds up alphabeta if you use move from previous iterative deepening iteration
 Astrobytes: you don't even need the TT for the previous best move but in conjunction with the TT yes, the speedup is great
 jacek: for move ordering i only use TT, killer moves and heursitc if i know any
 struct: but dont you reset the TT every time you need to increase the depth?
 jacek: my multithreading app causes my pc to reboot wtf
 struct: sell it
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: i dont. i only reset TT in beginnign of my turn
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: my TTEntry contains move and iteration
 Astrobytes: you can choose to overwrite entries based on equal or greater  depth
 struct: ah I see
 Astrobytes: or just always overwrite
 struct: so if you were at depth 2 and were searching until depth 6
 struct: and there was a state with depth 4 in the TT
 struct: you know the result
 struct: right?
 Astrobytes: Yes, depending on your replacement strategy
 struct: like max_depth - current_depth &lt;= depth_tt
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table#Depth-Preferred">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table#Depth-Preferred</a>
 Astrobytes: thanks jacek, was looking for that
 jacek: slowbytes
 Astrobytes: "eeyup"
 struct: yeah but thats too replace right?
 struct: to*
 struct: I think I understand
 Astrobytes: also, if your eval isn't too expensive you can do a basic move ordering just by eval'ing each move.
 struct: on c4 i wont have the depth problem
 jacek: you can afford more expensive ordering at shallow depths
 Astrobytes: Very true.
 jacek: hence the internal iterative deepening is a thing
 Astrobytes: Absolutely. There's a vast palette of strategies and tricks to use with ab, it's great
 jacek: ab is so 90s
 struct: what should I use then?
 struct: mcts?
 struct: I would if I could create a fast rollout
 jacek: NN :v
 Astrobytes: 90s my a$$ lol, it's applicable where needed :D
 struct: my bot did quite well this time vs robo
 struct: rng
 Astrobytes: I heard if you comment a little prayer to the RNG Gods in your code it helps :P
 struct: all I do is setting a random seed
 Verdi: bro i went to sleep and woke back up and realized the dumbest mistake ever I spent like 30 minutes on
 jacek: dream incubation eh
 Verdi: that or these almonds are magical
 Astrobytes: Definitely going with magical almonds.
 jacek: on an other note - i think i finally managed to make this n-tuple shit work for 2048 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/wysYXL6.png">https://i.imgur.com/wysYXL6.png</a>
 Astrobytes: oh wow, that looks promising
 struct: what do the left number mean?
 jacek: i think it found the bigger tile before rising again
 jacek: average score from last 1000 games
 Astrobytes: what have you changed? I remember it wasn't working correctly previously (Some time ago)
 jacek: this is 1-ply
 jacek: before i had had copied the weights updating from my board games agents. it wasnt working properly
 jacek: i have never dealt with situations where you can get intermediate rewards
 jacek: so i looked into pseudocode of that 2048 paper and copied carefully and it works
 Astrobytes: All or nothing previously then. Nice. Have your tried it online yet?
 Astrobytes: *you
 jacek: still its nowhere near the minimax bot
 jacek: gives its determinitics, shallow-ply minimax bot can reach 16k, 32k or even 64k never seen by the network yet
 Astrobytes: Ah. Well, it's a step in the right direction at least.
 jacek: not to mention this network has about 300k weights, which is quite small in comparison to state of the arts
 TimothyAlexisVass: How are clashes rated?
 TimothyAlexisVass: vs all who have done the clash or vs all in that round?
 KalamariKing: as in your clash placement (0-8th place), its between who did that specific clash in that specific lobby *with* you
 KalamariKing: so the ranking you see when you hover over "join a clash" on the home screen is what you're ranked out of everyone who's done at least 1 clash
 jzen: TimothyAlexisVass: This is going to be pure speculation from my side. But since the score values you see in the leaderboard are very similar to those in bot programming, I would imagine there is some overlap in how scoring in done in the two. i.e. it would be equivalent to playing a bot game with 2-8 players. And so scoring would be based on the lobby and the scores of the participating players
 KalamariKing: ^
 jzen: And of course the placement in that particular instance
 TimothyAlexisVass: KalamariKing I'm ranked 35, and I'm wondering if it matters who you play against in a clash or if you're scored according to all who played that specific clash.
 Uljahn: yes, it does matter because of underlying Trueskill algorithm, you should've checked the forum first
 TimothyAlexisVass: What forum?
 jacek: :upside_down:
 TimothyAlexisVass: can you point me to the forum post that explains the ranking system? I'm not finding anything like that
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/coc-score-calculation/188417">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/coc-score-calculation/188417</a>
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you mr. cat man sir
 jacek: tuhewsfjthrdkjgnxvfbdfhmm i am catman!
 rumoursinspace: [:
 Astrobytes: "what forum"The site redesign a while back worked well huh
 TimothyAlexisVass: I didn't know there was one :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was supposed to be more visible after the redesign lol
 Astrobytes: Community link in top menu bar
 struct: hmm trying to find how to mirror the c4 board
 struct: doesnt seems easy
 struct: seem*
 Astrobytes: I still haven't done anything proper on C4
 struct: if you ever do feel free to ask for help
 struct: my bot is not top level but is good enough
 Astrobytes: noted man, cheers
 struct: by top i mean not NN level
 Astrobytes: No I know
 Astrobytes: *Yes I know
 Astrobytes: (old London habit)
 struct: No was fine to me
 Astrobytes: Ah cool, confuses a lot of people
 struct: In portugal I say the same expression
 struct: Não, eu sei
 struct: Sim, eu sei
 struct: Both mean the same
 Astrobytes: yeah, makes sense to me too
 Astrobytes: in portugal do you also say "dinda" as a nickname for "madrinha"?
 Astrobytes: (bit random I know)
 MSmits: random bits?
 Astrobytes: Não
 AntwanR942: Has anyone completed the ASCII Art puzzle? The first test case wants E in the format however the console expects only "### " instead of the full letter.
 Astrobytes: I would check the testcases and the expected output
 Astrobytes: then re-read the statement
 AntwanR942: The example output and the console expected output are different&#160;:/
 struct: nope astro
 Astrobytes: right, might be a BR or just regional BR thing then
 struct: MSmits do you have any function to rotate the board in c4?
 MSmits: you mean flip left right?
 Astrobytes: mirror
 struct: I guess so
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/653ddfd2-413d-4093-b7f5-bc2527937871">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/653ddfd2-413d-4093-b7f5-bc2527937871</a>
 MSmits: not optimized
 MSmits: just for using my book, 1 time per turn
 struct: ah ok
 struct: I need something a bit faster I think
 struct: I want to try TT on mcts
 MSmits: int flip[63] = { 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 53, 52, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 62, 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54 };
 MSmits: guess i need to add that&#160;:)
 struct: im gonna try to do something like I have on breakthrough
 MSmits: I doubt it's useful at all
 MSmits: flipping the board i mean
 MSmits: mirror
 MSmits: because, imagine your game being at any state 5 plays
 MSmits: in
 MSmits: whats the chance it can reach mirrored states of eachother
 MSmits: almost 0
 MSmits: this only happens near the start
 Astrobytes: yeah I don't get the reasoning either tbh
 struct: hmm
 struct: maybe ill just ignore it then
 struct: at least for now
 struct: ill rewrite my bot probably
 MSmits: the only reason i have it is that locally, with 50 million states it happens a bit more often, but only because the start is always part of the tree
 MSmits: in a real game it's not
 MSmits: (except at the actual start)
 struct: CPU blessed me and gave me 4.2M rollout in 1 sec
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: You used a CPU prayer in the comments right :P
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/582880748">https://www.codingame.com/replay/582880748</a>
 struct: as p2
 Astrobytes: I need to improve my BT, I'm too close to remi
 MSmits: remi the dots and boxes guy?
 struct: time to ask coderpad to improve cpus
 struct: he has bt bot yeah
 MSmits: cool
 Astrobytes: Yes, remi inventor of mcts and such
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: he's the dots and boxes guy
 Astrobytes: remi coulom
 MSmits: ye him&#160;:)
 AntwanR942: Also if an output's last char is a space then the test cases fail and report nothing was found.
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: He also invented the term monte carlo tree search
 MSmits: i know, i remember people for the most important thing they do. 
 MSmits: like you sneaked out a window to avoid your GF's dad
 Astrobytes: *parents
 MSmits: oh right, neurons corrected!
 Astrobytes: That's not the most important thing I've ever done!
 MSmits: maybe not to you. It sticks out in my mind
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: like the dots and boxes guy
 Astrobytes: At least the dots and boxes thing is explainable
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: you mean you want me to go on a rant explaining dots and boxes right?
 Astrobytes: NO.
 MSmits: oh ok&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: got a week off
 MSmits: I'll do it tomorrow
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Compulsory holiday or personal?
 MSmits: or I can do it in 2 hrs when noone else is on
 MSmits: I like to imagine euler coming online in the morning and thinking to himself
 MSmits: ffs!
 Astrobytes: I'll be up late so I might stay around just to see if you do
 Astrobytes: and lol
 struct: hmm, cant download vs
 struct: not working&#160;:/
 MSmits: it's just a school vacation week btw
 Astrobytes: ah gotcha
 MSmits: but 1 week, so mostly an opportunity to catch up on work
 MSmits: stuff i was too tired to do before
 MSmits: christmas and summer vacations are the only real ones
 Astrobytes: Yeah, same for my teacher friends
 MSmits: I didn't know you had teacher friends
 struct: MSmits how deep does your c4 book goes?
 MSmits: if jacek was on he would now be saying: "I didn't know you had friends"
 Astrobytes: I have teacher friends and ex-teacher friends too
 MSmits: struct could be anywhere between 4 and 30 plies really
 MSmits: it's mcts so it doesn't have 1  depth limit
 MSmits: if you share a replay i will tell you how deep it went
 struct: nah its fine
 MSmits: mmh I don't even have teacher friends
 MSmits: just colleagues, a ton
 MSmits: all my friends are coders or coder adjacent
 Astrobytes: "coder adjacent"
 Astrobytes: like that
 MSmits: yeah i think he's mostly a manager of a team of coders
 Astrobytes: I have few coder friends irl tbh, well, not many that I see any more at least
 MSmits: we are a D&amp;D group since high school
 MSmits: don't see them much at all especially with covid, but we got something planned soon
 Astrobytes: the same group you still play with? That's awesome
 Astrobytes: Weren't you doing them virtually via zoom or something before?
 MSmits: yep, just not very often, about 3 times a year before covid
 MSmits: yeah we tried that, but it wasnt great
 Astrobytes: Yeah these kinda games are all about being around the board together
 MSmits: yeah exactly
 MSmits: most of them got kids and all so it's harder to find a good day fo rit
 Astrobytes: Yeah. I lost a lot of friends to kids
 MSmits: back in the day we played once every 2 weeks
 MSmits: I used to DM that, but it was soo much work. I won't do that anymore. I'd be totally fine playing a boardgame
 MSmits: like a normal board set, just to have an excuse to get together
 Astrobytes: DM is a lot of work yeah
 MSmits: gonna sleep, gn!
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits
 Astrobytes: ooo a bit late

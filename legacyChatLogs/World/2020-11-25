 tomatoes: ... -&gt; forum?
 linjoehan: Will a simultaneous multi allow 600 turns? or does each player use up one turn so only 300? 
 jrke: top right three dots nerchio
 VizGhar: strange feeling to clash clash created by me :D
 rockstar555: hii
 Nerchio: ooh thanks imo a weird place to have 'forum' btw
 Nerchio: should be on top panel i think
 Nerchio: thanks
 SurduTony: no nut november almost over, stay strong
 AntiSquid: lol
 struct: I think he has been warned already
 struct: I wasnt here
 struct: chat bugged?
 JBM: any more than usual?
 AntiSquid: who got warned? 
 AntiSquid: rockstar555 anything apart from hi&#160;?
 LordSkaven: he says hii sometimes
 ruasd: :V
 ruasd:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: linjoehan you can have a total CPU time of 30s which is equal to 600 single player actions at 50ms each. so it's 300 turns each in 1vs1
 melchi: zo
 mathieuschnd2: HELLO
 ZarthaxX: hai
 struct: hi
 AntonCosmin: hi guys
 sebak: hello programmers
 AtomicDemon_f847: Hello
 MadKnight: hello sebak
 miszu: I finally was able to unit test my UTTT
 MadKnight: gg
 miszu: I created lots of lookup table that I need to compute at turn 1. It's good to test correctness
 miszu: also tested the small board for my bits operations. Now I will write tests for big board and make sure the states are correct

 kovi: wow<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/xevixevi">https://twitter.com/xevixevi</a>
 dbdr: why wow kovi?
 eulerscheZahl: now you have to fight back dbdr
 dbdr: yeah. I know I can improve, but that's a lot
 kovi: seems that xevi is not a one trick pony
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: "I reduced it by about 100 steps. I'm not sure about the limits, but it won't be so easy. Since there is no drill, it is finished for the time being, so which one is next?
 struct: anyone has any resources on handling bitboards bigger than 64 bits
 eulerscheZahl: somehow chat is still laggy for me
 struct: The pdf I read doesnt have a lot about it
 mars_magnet: Hi
 dbdr: drill is probably a mistranlation
 dbdr: any japanese speaker around?
 darkhorse64: struct: gcc supports 128 bits but if you look at the assembly it's just 2x64bits. I don't think there is much too gain from it
 struct: darkhorse64 i wanted to try on HS
 struct: But I dont understand how I can work with 3x ui64
 struct: I dont understand how to go from 1 region to another
 eulerscheZahl: he's not really checking if numbers are prime but hardcoding according to twitter
 eulerscheZahl: but i guess you assumed that before
 darkhorse64: You have also been tempted to Beam Search by the latest contest. Ask MSmits for info on HS
 struct: Yeah, i kinda managed to  do a beam search of some kind
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 struct: The problem is that I cant find MSmits
 ZarthaxX: he is busy
 ZarthaxX: just wait lol
 Westicles: no drill probably means no time limit
 dbdr: yeah
 darkhorse64: There is nothing in the PMs&#160;? I haven't read them
 eulerscheZahl: ixanezix (HS contest winner) used a 128bit integer to store the board
 ZarthaxX: that's what i told him
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i have a typo in the name
 darkhorse64: Look like an Asterix &amp; Obelix name
 Lysk: :D
 struct: I dont think he stored the board on 128 bits
 struct: but the boxes
 eulerscheZahl: a little bit of info about number shifting: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/xevixevi/status/1323805595619635201">https://twitter.com/xevixevi/status/1323805595619635201</a>

 darkhorse64: There is a LHAC implementation for NS on Marchete GitHub repos
 darkhorse64: Sorry LAHC
 dbdr: public bot? :O
 darkhorse64: Without eval ...
 eulerscheZahl: one that gets you around lvl200 i think
 eulerscheZahl: didn't test
 darkhorse64: I used this algo for A*C
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: I need \ that does division in the reverse order&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: reverse order? you mean modulo?
 eulerscheZahl: aah, for shorter code
 eulerscheZahl: CG funge
 dbdr: stack(0)/stack(1)
 Westicles: We can let some weirdo cat guy beat us
 Westicles: can't
 eulerscheZahl: he worked hard on it
 eulerscheZahl: more than 2 months for number shifting. then shared a screenshot of level 654
 eulerscheZahl: looks massive
 Westicles: Maybe I'll try to improve it a little... unless you want to take him dbdr?
 dbdr: not now I think
 ProMikeSundays: hi

 TheMusicalGiant_6f99: Hi
 ProMikeSundays: what is your opinion on programmers getting automated because of more advanced versions of gpt-3?

 ProMikeSundays: :joy:
 zub: im terrible
 Jabberwocky733: Trying to get to Gold league with C. Any tips?
 Jabberwocky733: For instance, is it worth it to use a machine learning approach, or is a rule-based heuristic adequate?
 Lysk: that choice has little to do with the language
 Jabberwocky733: True, although I would probably switch to Python if I wanted to go with machine learning. 
 Uljahn: ML is rarely an option on CG
 Jabberwocky733: I'm trying to find a pragmatic way to describe a strategy directly, but I think it's difficult and tedious. 
 Jabberwocky733: Oh, interesting @Uljahn. Is  that because there's just not enough time to evaluate the neural network?
 Uljahn: ye, also your code is limited by 100k chars
 Jabberwocky733: I saw that it's possible to download and run the referee locally, so I assumed that unsupervised learning would be possible
 Jabberwocky733: Ohhhh
 Jabberwocky733: cool
 Jabberwocky733: That actually makes me quite happy to hear, though, since ML is sort of the same approach regardless of the game, which is kinda boring
 Jabberwocky733: But what do you do instead? Just a hierarchy of functions calling functions? Or maybe something like a state machine? 
 Lysk: check the forum, the thread "feedback&amp;strategies", it will give you an overview of what people tried
 Jabberwocky733: Thanks Lysk, I'll check it out!
 Lysk: here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/</a>
 Jabberwocky733: Thanks a lot :thumbsup:
 Uljahn: i guess top players often use search-based algorithms to find suboptimal solution in a given time
 Uljahn: you need to reimplement a game engine and them simulate and evaluate consequent states to search for better actions
 Jabberwocky733: Alright, I thought implementing simulation too. That sounds doable and fun. Thanks a lot.&#160;:) 
 jacek: ML is rarely applicable here due to time and size constraints
 jacek: well offline params optimization is more of a thing
 Uljahn: some games are ML-friendly though
 eulerscheZahl: should have done the latter, felt a bit lazy on it
 Jabberwocky733: Makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: would have given a better return than the C++ conversion i think
 struct: sorry for suggesting port&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: my fault for doing it
 struct: I was paid by top players
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: at least now you know that i'm capable of writing some C++
 eulerscheZahl: back to C#
 struct: jacek you are also good with bitboards right?
 jacek: a bit
 struct: Do you know anything about using multiple int64 to represent a board
 struct: Like if board is bigger than 64 bits
 jacek: i was going to try one. i think i found gomoku on multiple ints on github
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/wwatkins42/gomoku">https://github.com/wwatkins42/gomoku</a>
 jacek: 19x19 board
 struct: Thanks Ill check
 struct: I never really done bitboards, not sure if its a wise choice to go this route
 struct: for the first time
 jacek: 8x8 boards are straightforward
 eulerscheZahl: 7x7 even more
 ZarthaxX: 1x1 evenmore
 eulerscheZahl: extra space to clear after shifting
 jacek: and beyong bit"boards", bit operations are generally faster
 eulerscheZahl: you won ZarthaxX
 jacek: 0x0
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 TimberStalker: what is a bitboard? is it just using ints to make a 2d array?
 ZarthaxX: that's a face jacek
 ZarthaxX: jacek and copying the state
 ZarthaxX: also faster
 struct: I also found this tutorial if anyone wants to check
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/01-introduction/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/01-introduction/</a>
 struct: its about connect 4, but talks about a lot of stuff
 jacek: too bad we dont have connect4 on CG
 struct: but we do
 ZarthaxX: that bot goes super fast anyway
 jacek: but its ugly
 ZarthaxX: kind of solved lol
 struct: my feelings&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: noob struct
 struct: which bot ZarthaxX?
 jacek: oh karliso changed avatar
 jacek: looked familiar
 eulerscheZahl: i like it
 eulerscheZahl: it's from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://craftpix.net/freebies/knight-character-free-sprite/">https://craftpix.net/freebies/knight-character-free-sprite/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but he recolored it to make it blue
 ZarthaxX: struct the one of that article
 struct: it goes fast at the end
 ZarthaxX: i played against it years ago, goes super fast and has the optimal always
 struct: at the start not so much
 ZarthaxX: hardcode the options for beginning and gg xconnect4
 ZarthaxX: anyway yes, its a cool article
 struct: i got legend finally ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: where?
 ZarthaxX: ah
 ZarthaxX: fall
 struct: fc2020
 ZarthaxX: i have to go there
 ZarthaxX: gz man&#160;:)
 struct: I just waited
 ZarthaxX: proudy of my structy
 struct: I was top 40 and got pushed to legend
 ZarthaxX: ah, the waiting game, classic
 ZarthaxX: LOL wtf
 tomatoes: :thumbsup:
 ZarthaxX: it's nice that they opened it earlier
 MadKnight: eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: MadKnight
 MadKnight: remind me
 MadKnight: what did u not like about java's lists&#160;?
 MadKnight: there was something
 <b>**eulerscheZahl reminds MadKnight</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: arraylist&lt;integer[]&gt;?
 MadKnight: like
 MadKnight: oh right
 eulerscheZahl: something like that is broken
 TimberStalker: Why would you do that though?
 eulerscheZahl: because i'm evil
 TimberStalker: cant you just use integer[][]?
 eulerscheZahl: or list&lt;list&lt;int&gt;&gt;
 TimberStalker: that too i guess
 eulerscheZahl: but when i know the size for one dimension but not the other
 TimberStalker: You can still use an arraylist if you know the size of the dimension
 MadKnight: but he doesn't
 TimberStalker: Simple question. Can you use multiple files for coding?
 MadKnight: ofc
 MadKnight: i do
 MadKnight: i'm using multiple files + custom script to merge my entire code into 1 file + cg local that sync's local code file with CG ide 
 TimberStalker: i mean, yes, but i meant builtin.
 MadKnight: why would u need someone else's when u can make your own
 therealbeef: Are there limits on source file size or compilation time?
 Uljahn: 100k chars and 1 sec for the first turn
 eulerscheZahl: compilation
 MadKnight: yea 100k chars means 200k bytes if u use uft16
 eulerscheZahl: i think 20s. a little more for clojure
 therealbeef: ah, to prevent people from generating large lookup tables offline?
 eulerscheZahl: to keep the database small
 struct: cg saves all the code
 Uljahn: to prevent submit history from exploding yes
 reCurse: It can be larger than 200kb with utf8
 TimberStalker: for those who use a language with curly brackets, do you use option a or b
 TimberStalker: option a: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34261701-5262-43b7-904e-5a5544a66699">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/34261701-5262-43b7-904e-5a5544a66699</a>
 CommanderCero: are you trying to cause a war
 TimberStalker: Maybe
 TimberStalker: I use option b by the way
 VizGhar: You should not care about that :D
 VizGhar: why do you care? For C#, C, C++ I'll choose style B, for any other language style A (Java, JS, Kotlin, Dart...)
 zub: option a, all day
 VizGhar: whatever ide choose on autoformat
 struct: i use A to save my enter key
 therealbeef: B. code needs to breathe
 VizGhar: :D but you have to strike SPACE
 therealbeef: made a bot that takes 2 minutes to compile&#160;:-(
 struct: 2 minutes to compile?
 struct: What have you done?
 TimberStalker: How?
 therealbeef: solving TTT using template meta programming
 eulerscheZahl: "whatever ide choose on autoformat"same here
 eulerscheZahl: there are some really ugly styles though
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style</a>
 eulerscheZahl: like whitesmith, seriously?
 struct: haskell seems even worse
 therealbeef: compilation timeout is 10s&#160;:-(
 eulerscheZahl: there are some examples of how not to do it IMO
 TimberStalker: Who in the world would EVER use haskel
 eulerscheZahl: JBM triggered
 struct: therealbeef dont forget that TTT changes once you go above wood 2
 struct: or wood1
 JBM: yeah that haskell example is completely invalid
 JBM: there's no while keyword, so it can't be layout-inducing
 JBM: there was a viral tweet some time ago with the various haskell indenting styles
 TimberStalker: wait.
 zub: but if you use haskell you can post on your twitter about monads and think everyone thinks your super smart
 TimberStalker: I just realised ti-84 programming is basically haskell
 ZarthaxX: therealbeef u crazy :P
 therealbeef: it works though&#160;;-) instant regular TTT solve from any position 
 therealbeef: maybe I can let the compiler only do the later moves and put some runtime stuff on top of it
 ZarthaxX: o.o
 ZarthaxX: you should do UTTT :D
 MadKnight: yea u can just bruteforce all the possibilities for TTT
 JBM: TimberStalker: well haskell is basically math, so there's some idea behind that similarity
 ParticleBeam: Odd. Code I ran this morning is running much faster now than before
 ParticleBeam: Oh. Running slow again. Must have been random chance
 jacek: its tired
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi nerds
 ToshiTuringMachine: i am looking for ideas to improve my code of the rings branf*ck score. any help/documentation?
 ZarthaxX: hi toshi
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*

 ToshiTuringMachine: hi brothers
 ToshiTuringMachine: what score you have there? i cannot get better than 7439
 eulerscheZahl: 3534
 struct: 5881
 struct: with simple solution
 ParticleBeam: 5921 with simple calc
 ToshiTuringMachine: wow gg. any idea? like i can create the entire alphabet with +[&gt;-[&gt;+.&lt;-]+.-&gt;+&lt;&lt;-]
 eulerscheZahl: +++++++++++[-&gt;+[.+]+.-&lt;]
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah that is the test 17 but what's the best way to create all the 21 runes and not write anything
 ToshiTuringMachine: i mean 26
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/510812160">https://www.codingame.com/replay/510812160</a>close :P
 NicolasH_42: c'est du brainfk&#160;? 
 ParticleBeam: Odd. Replay not working properly for me
 eulerscheZahl: was sagt er da?
 eulerscheZahl: after f5 it does for me
 ParticleBeam: Nope. Tried reloading a few times. Maybe its something on my machine
 Stranger.K: Does anyone know how I can get the IP of visitors of a website and then contact them? 
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds like 2 close to impossible questions at once
 ToshiTuringMachine: for me too the replay doesn't move after turn 9
 struct: keep refreshing
 struct: after a while it worked for me
 eulerscheZahl: hardcode this+[[+&gt;]+[&lt;]&gt;]
 ToshiTuringMachine: yeah cool
 ToshiTuringMachine: amazing really
 ToshiTuringMachine: but it says Failure: Bilbo has too many actions to perform (infinite loop?)
 eulerscheZahl: told you it's close but not working
 TimberStalker: what is that game even about?
 struct: I think Im going to discard bitboards for now for HS
 ToshiTuringMachine: the replay gave me a correct stop at turn 2600 lol
 struct: I have some stuff i need to ask msmits
 struct: euler do you think normal sim without bitboards will do well enough for legend?
 eulerscheZahl: it's not the same code :P
 eulerscheZahl: HS is an easy legend
 struct: ok, ill do it without bitboards for now, its slowing me down too much
 eulerscheZahl: pain starts around rank 100
 eulerscheZahl: aka sayonara wall
 struct: cp wall?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: 3rd of contest
 struct: so if I win vs that bot
 struct: how much do i climb?
 struct: 80 ranks?
 eulerscheZahl: below 100 or around top10
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl suddenly changed to German in one sentence? :P

 0ffset: Hi, i know this may sound awkward but can somebody lend me a hand on how to improve at IA?
 JordiV: In the ANEO puzzle, anyone know why the 2nd testcase wants 36km/h and not 50&#160;? the distance is 200m the duration of the lights 10  secs
 miszu: JordiV floating point precision loss&#160;:)
 ParticleBeam: I remember one of the testcases I had a floating point issue
 miszu: a hint: you can solve this problem with no division and all with integers if you do some tricks
 JordiV: alright, so i am going to convert m/s to km/h by dividing by 1000 and multiplying by 3600, maybe that'll help&#160;:)
 miszu: you don't need to divide
 JordiV: if i multiply by 3.6 i'm using float's again (i'm still a student so it's possible imiss something obvious 
 miszu: don't multiply by 3.6
 miszu: think of.. in high school how you deal with fractions multiplication and division
 miszu: so you can keep whole numbers
 miszu: did it click a bell?&#160;;)
 JordiV: Alright :grin: thanks for the help! i'll try it out :sunglasses:
 MSmits: Hey, anyone want to play a Q-learned game of octapawn. Takes about 1-2 min to train in the browser and then you can play it
 struct: sure MSmits
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/python/c673de5c0f?outputOnly=true&amp;runOption=run">https://trinket.io/python/c673de5c0f?outputOnly=true&amp;runOption=run</a>
 jacek: Q-learny by whom
 MSmits: by itself
 struct: Also when you have some free time i would like to talk with you about HS
 MSmits: selfplay
 MSmits: hypersonic?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: i got time now for a few questions
 struct: ok, what did you use to store the board?
 struct: I havent got much bitboarding experience
 MSmits: 128 bit type for c++, but it's basically 2 64 bit
 MSmits: well, several of those
 MSmits: 128 bit for boxes
 struct: how can I store 13x11, in a 128?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits I rewrote my UTTT into MCTS... it did about the same as my older version.  I only got 750 sim games, any bit tricks u can think of I might be missing besides bitpacking the board?
 MSmits: lemme help struct first here
 MSmits: sec, lemme look up my formula
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's all good
 MSmits: its pretty complicated
 jacek: can i play with black
 struct: if its really complicated maybe I can store it other way
 miszu: ParticleBeam which lagnguage?
 MSmits: nah sorry, but thats a good thing, this game is solved as a win for white jacek
 miszu: I can have 16k sims
 struct: For example for the board you dont store emtpy cells?
 MSmits: i dont store the pillars
 struct: the entire grid
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm rewriting Bandas and seeing how many sims I can get, so I'll be around.  U play.&#160;;)
 MSmits: ohh i remember now, it's vs code
 struct: Wait you dont store the pillars?
 struct: How can you know they are there?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dbfafb32-403f-4da2-b700-1d1687caaac5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dbfafb32-403f-4da2-b700-1d1687caaac5</a>
 MSmits: enjoy the amazing formula :P
 MSmits: it skips pillars
 MSmits: so thats why it fits in 128 bit
 struct: hmm, ill need to study it
 struct: I thought you used like 3x64ints
 ParticleBeam: miszu What language for what?
 miszu: so you could use the 128 bit to store your UTTT states?
 MSmits: I think this is the reverse operaton struct
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44c4a843-5e44-4c55-938b-1c7016042b2a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44c4a843-5e44-4c55-938b-1c7016042b2a</a>
 miszu: ParticleBeam for what you are coding
 ParticleBeam: I am currently working with C#
 MSmits: miszu it is actually possible to store a full uttt board in 128 bit, but it's extremely complex and not worth it
 MSmits: I only do it for my offline meta mcts database
 MSmits: saves space
 MSmits: also better transpositions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in UTTT I'm not storing the states, just using a depth decay factor and adding the endgame to the first move eval
 MSmits: the basic thing to realize is that there are only 8629 miniboards
 MSmits: as opposed to 3^9 which is what most people think
 struct: thanks MSmits, I had no clue how they were storing stuff in 128 bits
 MSmits: yeah i spent a bit of time figuring that one out struct
 struct: ok i finally managed to find the winning solution
 jacek: a bit of time... i see what you did there
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 struct: for that game
 MSmits: cool!
 MSmits: I have trouble finding it
 MSmits: hexapawn is much easier
 MSmits: it only has like 252 nodes in the tree
 MSmits: and using brain means you visit like 20 to solve it
 Doumaki: helloes, i would like to learn some real AI
 Doumaki: am 2cond year computer dev student 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Quite a bit of 2d interleaving going on in that HS snippet msmits
 MSmits: yeah PatrickMcGinnisII
 jacek: i keep trying to go diagonally as in bt :c
 MSmits: oh right, it;s not actually like bt. It's like chess
 struct: 43422
 MSmits: 43422 positions you mean?
 Doumaki: what are u talking abt?
 MSmits: several things at once sorry Doumaki
 struct: I meant solution for octapawn
 MSmits: Ohhhh
 MSmits: lemme try it
 struct: oh it doesnt play always the same?
 MSmits: it's still learning
 MSmits: from you
 struct: oh nice
 Doumaki: am working on this /ide/puzzle/factorial-vs-exponential
 MSmits: yeah i have a hexapawn version that also learns from you, but it doesnt self train
 MSmits: so it's just learning by playing vs you
 MSmits: this octopawn does both
 MSmits: doumaki thats a puzzle right
 Doumaki: yepp
 struct: So the learning is only saved on my browser right?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: very good msmits
 MSmits: i tried a 5 pawn version
 MSmits: it took almost 1GB of memory
 MSmits: to fully train
 MSmits: still solved as white
 struct: how long?
 MSmits: half an hour or so
 Doumaki: wait a second 
 Doumaki: u guys actuammy train AI s?
 miszu: MSmits yeah I won
 MSmits: cool&#160;:)
 miszu: took me a while to find a combinations
 jacek: and it's Q table?
 MSmits: it's a giant python dictionary
 MSmits: key = board 1 + board 2 + move origin + move destination
 MSmits: it stores a score between -1 and 1
 MSmits: and uses simple learning rate formula
 MSmits: so no fancy NN of course. This is intended for my AI course. I'm testing it tomorrow with 2 students that are far ahead
 jacek: Doumaki yah, its AI training
 jacek: i never actually fully understood "policy" function training, i only optimize value funcion
 miszu: MSmits for my UTTT I used lookup table for all possible moves and random moves for the small boards. Any advice for bigger board what approach should I do?
 MSmits: jacek I never used it either, before
 MSmits: I guess it only matters on transpositions, as you can get to the same state by multiple routes
 MSmits: combining the state + move prevents some problems that happen with transpositions
 tomatoes: bigger board is small board
 MSmits: miszu you need to write a search
 struct: MSmits also I have one last questions sorry, VS does not have int128?
 struct: I tried to find but couldnt
 MSmits: it doesn't
 MSmits: this is the only bot i coded in VS code
 struct: ah ok, its no problem
 miszu: well I am doing MCTS but right now I do only 16k sims. I am writing unit tests for my game engine because something is off there. But I also want to optimize and get rid of vectors. How to get all possible moves but returning an array and somehow knowing # of moves
 MSmits: with a horribly configured IDE, mostly no intellisense
 struct: ill use  wsl2 to use gcc
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: I might be the wrong guy to ask, i use a pretty far out way to generate moves and such
 MSmits: there are simpler ways that are probably just as good
 MSmits: hard to test
 jacek: miszu well i use lookup table for small board as well. 
 MSmits: yeah i have had versions that do that
 MSmits: it's fine
 jacek: as for bigger board i 'concatenate' the possible moves
 miszu: jacek small board is easy
 jacek: bigger board moves happen rarely anyway
 darkhorse64: You have been misse MSmits; you have a queue of at least three people eager to get knowlege from you
 darkhorse64: *missed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl
 MSmits: yeah it seems so lol, hi darkhorse64
 miszu: but bigger board, it's like.. you need to check where last was played and then add all moves
 miszu: so couple of conditions
 MSmits: yeah it's painful miszu
 jacek: yes, thats what i do
 miszu: jacek are you legendary or no?
 MSmits: it helps to put in some heuristics to make this move less likely
 miszu: because I am legendary now
 jacek: yeah im in legend
 MSmits: because it's bad to give the opponent a free move anyway
 miszu: do you have a method that returns a list of all possible moves or no?
 MSmits: (most of the time)
 MSmits: I don't make lists no
 MSmits: I think i just iterate over them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in uttt you almost want to just minmax the smallboard wins
 MSmits: as i create them
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII i tried that, it's bad
 miszu: minmax is slow
 miszu: I want to use vanilla mcts
 MSmits: well not that, the eval function is bad
 MSmits: vanilla mcts works great
 miszu: yeah eval is not obvious
 jacek: miszu well yes. i have 9 boards in my Board class
 miszu: but for mcts you need to keep track of all moves
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well I'm only Mcing 750 sims in 100ms, that's freaking slow
 miszu: and it's a pain to keep track of
 MSmits: yeah PatrickMcGinnisII i think research shows minimax is more effective with low calc time
 jacek: hm? i just make move and undo move
 MSmits: mcts scales better with faster cpu
 miszu: jacek how you iterate over all children?
 miszu: how you store children?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my small board book and large board library performed just as well as the mcts with 1/10th of the exec time
 MSmits: I have a giant object pool
 MSmits: children already exist
 MSmits: they are just indexed to
 MSmits: 700 mb of nodes
 miszu: i get your ideas but can't picture the implementation
 jacek: likewise. my game tree is just 'pointers' to the moves pool
 MSmits: so when i make children I say: Your children are at index 125732 and there are 8 of them
 MSmits: so that's 2 integers
 MSmits: makes for tiny nodes
 miszu: in your node, do you have an object for your game engine?
 miszu: my game engine can do sims and all the moves
 miszu: and calculations of win/loss/draws
 jacek: the node is simple - wins, visits, list of children, move
 jacek: what do you mean object for game engine
 MSmits: I only have a Node
 PatrickMcGinnisII: simple things like whether to use static or not can +/- your code spped by 10-15%
 MSmits: no other objects
 miszu: I have a struct called GameEngine. It is responsible to keep the state of the game and you can apply moves() play random moves() and simulate till outcone()
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er speed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: game extends board i would think
 miszu: I have SmallBoard, Board which contains 9 SmallBoards and GameEngine which contains 1 Board
 miszu: and then Node which contains 1 GameEngine
 MSmits: btw miszu, for uttt i dont store the state on the node
 MSmits: my node has the move only
 miszu: ok but how can you simulate then?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/694cdd6b-61a6-4ffd-8f33-a831756786dd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/694cdd6b-61a6-4ffd-8f33-a831756786dd</a>
 MSmits: ignore that zerochild thingy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u don't have to store alot of stuff, just pass a couple things on node creation
 tomatoes: play while traverse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's alot for 1 node MSmits
 miszu: yeah but how can you keep track of the state of the game of that node?
 MSmits: not a lot of bytes though PatrickMcGinnisII
 AntiSquid: isNeutered would be a shorter variable name 
 jacek: bonus? status?
 MSmits: status is solved -1,0, 1
 ZarthaxX: jacek what did you do in breakthrough to be so far away?
 MSmits: bonus is a bonus i add for causing free moves and such (= actually a penalty)
 MSmits: its a bonus on selection
 jacek: heuristic?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: ZarthaxX NN
 struct: hacked referee
 ZarthaxX: NN for what part?
 jacek: for eval
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not in uttt, but in other games I make one big nodelist and like MSm said, just store the indexes as pointers in the nodes themselves
 jacek: used in jacekmax (or MCTS w/ ept)
 ZarthaxX: jacekmax is a minmax of your own? :P
 ZarthaxX: impressive
 ZarthaxX: nice results
 MSmits: it's UCT guided minimax
 MSmits: best first basically
 AntiSquid: which model was it&#160;? some alphazero&#160;? jacek
 MSmits: works nicely
 jacek: most of stuff is in the eval, it could be used in minimax as well
 MSmits: yeah, you can do that jacek, EPT eval does not translate to minimax well
 ZarthaxX: guided minmax???
 MSmits: yeah, so not one depth
 miszu: so you store just the move but where you store the actual state of the game?
 ZarthaxX: you mean in the way it explores?
 MSmits: but variable depth like mcts
 ZarthaxX: mmm
 ZarthaxX: wait what
 MSmits: you backpropagate in minmax fashion
 ZarthaxX: isnt it like mcts then&#160;?
 jacek: AntiSquid nah, feed board state into NN and use output as eval
 ZarthaxX: ah,ok 
 MSmits: no, mcts adds scores
 MSmits: this one replaces
 ZarthaxX: mmmmmmmmmmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in bandas i just seem to grasp how to do the move transformations bitwise for up and down
 ZarthaxX: okey
 ZarthaxX: i need to check it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er can't
 Moctrof: Someone is strong for objet oriented design pattern and things like this&#160;? I have a question not related to coding game
 jacek: yes, the only difference
 AntiSquid: homing minimax 
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII it's painful yeah
 AntiSquid: oof lag? suddenly i didn't see any new message for a while 
 jacek: ZarthaxX <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 MSmits: i even transform the board so it sits in the corner, on ever move
 AntiSquid: and then it flooded
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rotate the bitmatrix 90 degrees and go with the left/right transformations?
 MSmits: that way i can use the bitboard as a lookup for an endgame bok
 MSmits: book
 ZarthaxX: thanks jacek&#160;:*
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII I just iteratively push
 MSmits: until nothing moves anymore
 MSmits: so all dudes get pushed, if some dudes overlap, i do it again for those
 MSmits: until no overlap
 MSmits: while loop
 ZarthaxX: MSmits i liked your python thingy btw
 ZarthaxX: but bot doesnt play first
 MSmits: thanks
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: yeah so you're guaranteed the whin
 MSmits: win
 MSmits: except you dont, cuz its still better :P
 MSmits: until you play enough games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, like i know its sloppy, but I'm trying to get rid of the char board that i have now
 MSmits: wanna see my bandas node?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3e81a4a3-6696-4bd3-829f-87d780828c37">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3e81a4a3-6696-4bd3-829f-87d780828c37</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that
 ZarthaxX: php?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that is a down transformation
 jacek: :scream:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's slow AF
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: you're awesome for being able to read that :P
 AntiSquid: char board @_@
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea it's garbage, but it plays
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/13b4e19b-810d-4922-8b9b-0930ed68d5db">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/13b4e19b-810d-4922-8b9b-0930ed68d5db</a>
 MSmits: i store the boards on the node
 MSmits: cuz it's not much info
 MSmits: all boards have 4 children so you can leave out the childmax also
 AntiSquid: i am just looking at all the $$$$$ while trying to process the code PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: just index
 AntiSquid: i never get used to the $ all over the place 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i hate it because it reminds me of BASIC, puke ... but it's so easy to code
 MSmits: easier than python?
 jacek: my eval for bandas <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hastebin.com/mulopopazi">https://hastebin.com/mulopopazi</a>
 jacek: sill easier than php
 PatrickMcGinnisII: PY drives me nutz, It likes wants to truncate my floats when i don't want it to
 MSmits: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: while loop, hmm
 MSmits: i have one of those Chinese strings as well jacek, but for me it's an endgame book
 AntiSquid: php isn't hard just hard to read if you don't use it regularly 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek, google translated your hastebin... wth
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII python sure has its quirks, but i picked it up easily
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Lost and destructive, victorious, victorious, victorious, victorious, victorious, victorious, victorious, afflicted, afflicted, afflicted,  ....
 jacek: thats bandas allright
 MSmits: rofl
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII it's a compressed neural network i am guessing
 MSmits: apparently it's pretty dramatic
 AntiSquid: afflicted by the urge for victory
 AntiSquid: or yearning 
 MSmits: wanna do my endgame book too PatrickMcGinnisII	?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is it chinese or danish or german?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII chcukles</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: 겆푪䟨킎췎ᇘ㘰䘊䘊
 MSmits: it's the first part of it
 MSmits: dunno what language
 PatrickMcGinnisII: says it's koreean
 struct: you have opening book for othello right?
 MSmits: i do struct
 AntiSquid: no it has korean mixed with chinese in it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, that's more like it MSmits, pure binary gibberish
 AntiSquid: first is a korean sylabe, then some random ascii, then chinese and then korean
 MSmits: yeah, when people ask me if I speak Chinese or Korean, I say only at the end of a game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: one word is "Pan"
 MSmits: Peter Pan?
 struct: it speaks
 struct: Its trying to send a message
 jacek: thats where you fry your seeds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then "Thousands
 AntiSquid: .this is what google translate gave me when i removed the hangul bits: Sang sang sang sang
 MSmits: oh right, maybe my oware bot says more pan
 PatrickMcGinnisII: this could take all day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "Pan Thousand Spit"
 MSmits: oh no nvm it doesnt even use unicode
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i give up
 MSmits: just numbers 0 to 5
 MSmits: with spaces even... os badly compressed
 MSmits: so
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the next word shoud be dead.... and si it would equal P.T.S.D.
 MSmits: i wouldnt mind pasting more of my bandas endgame book, but my VS crashes half the time i try to touch it
 AntiSquid: Qian qi qian qian
 MSmits: the string is too long 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: end game PTSD that gives you PTSD
 AntiSquid: to me it gives:푪킎췎ᇘ =&gt; pyolpkuinhchwekkᇘ =&gt; Wow (English translation) :D
 AntiSquid: which obviously has to be inaccurate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think i remember you saying you preprocess best endgames, that would save alot of time
 Bikoko: should I learn java or js for backend bros?
 AntiSquid: 푪킎췎 = puffiness in korean, MSmits :P
 AntiSquid: i suggest shaving your head
 MSmits: lol, i do this already
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll be puffy tomorrow, Thanksgiving
 AntiSquid: Bikoko what do you want to achieve?
 AntiSquid: and what do you want to do . 
 Bikoko: I want to be a backend developer
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Americans: any excuse to pig out   Everyone else:  wth
 AntiSquid: uhm ugh agh ... well C++ could help just as much ... what matters is what the company that you want to work for uses
 PatrickMcGinnisII: js....frontend ... C# backend, heh
 MSmits: on thanksgiving, all Americans are backend developers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I bought 10lbs. of prime rib, gonna take like 9 hours to cook
 Bikoko: I want to work in a bank
 AntiSquid: is thanksgiving banned in america&#160;? lol seen some angry message on social media
 AntiSquid: then research your local banks or whatever banks you want
 MSmits: lol AntiSquid, what corner do the algorithms put you. That's a fox new conspiracy :P
 tomatoes: cobol
 Bikoko: thank bros
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i remember doing cobol III, yea banks love that shiz
 MSmits: basically the CDC discourages travel on thanksgiving to prevent spread of covid, is all
 AntiSquid: fox news conspiracy? all main stream media is under the same blanket
 AntiSquid: idk how much is true of it, i don't live in the US, lockdowns are real though
 AntiSquid: UK is in a new lockdown till 4th of december or so
 MSmits: mostly it's 3 camps nowadays, mainstream center/left which includes cnn msnbc and others, then fox right, then extreme right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's like a dozen of us pigging out and hitting the pool
 MSmits: extreme right is OAN and newsmax
 MSmits: definitely not all on the same blanket
 AntiSquid: well i don't watch either, all shit imo
 MSmits: it's pretty bad
 MSmits: the political bias varies, but the sensation bias is worst
 AntiSquid: and fox news when i checked it was all over the place 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't go to Parler.com, holy crap there are some nutz on there
 AntiSquid: worse than twitter?
 BoBot: if I did not know, I would have thought parler.com is a gay dating site
 MSmits: fox news has somewhat neutral news hosts and pretty far right opinion hosts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh it's ALL alt-right
 MSmits: it depends on what show you watch
 jacek: newsmax?
 MSmits: watch tucker carlson or sean hannity for some pretty extreme, crazy stuff
 MSmits: or watch chris wallace for... mostly just news
 MSmits: some what right oriented, but no lies
 AntiSquid: uhm i doubt i can rely on anything there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: example of parler&#160;: "COLORADO PROUD BOYS LEADER DEAL WITH ANTIFA BLM RIOTERS BY SLAPPING THE PHONE OUT OF HIS HANDS "
 MSmits: probably not "rely" but thats relative
 MSmits: jacek newsmax is a growing channel that just tripled in size because Trump hated on fox
 MSmits: cuz you know, he lost and fox admits that
 MSmits: (mostly)
 AntiSquid: i didn't try parler, all i know is it's supposedly lacking censorship, which is getting really annoying to watch on twitter / reddit / facebook . but i guess it makes sense, right wingers would go to parler if they are banned on twitter
 TimberStalker: interesting conversation
 PatrickMcGinnisII: FB doesn't support a free internet, but doesn't want to pay taxes ... so i try out all the new social media platforms
 AntiSquid: i've seen vids of crazy BLM / ANTIFA ... less of crazy proud boys, they exist, but they don't burn buildings down
 MSmits: the critical part is that FB is not a news platform, people try to use it that way and then complain when they censor people for lying on it
 MSmits: its a company
 MSmits: they can do whatever they want
 MSmits: twitter same
 AntiSquid: not really, they are supposed to act neutral
 MSmits: they dont have to
 MSmits: no obligation at all
 TimberStalker: Theres a big problem with censorship though. 
 TimberStalker: All you do is embolden the people you censor
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well they censor stuff that doesn't fit their agenda... they label alot of Truth as "fake" and dangerous.  So I hate that
 BoBot: in what way are they "supposed to"? am I supposed to act neutral? as a private citizen? when does my right to be biased end? how large does my platform/company be?
 MSmits: what truth?
 BoBot: have to be*
 BoBot: before I am not allowed to be biased?
 MSmits: facebook only censors because of their reputation
 meh1001: The issue with them censoring stuff is that they are a company, but they are claiming the lack of liability for content due to being a public forum
 MSmits: after all, genocide was commited through facebook
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's the 6 degrees of freedom problem... someone you don't know might get offended randomly
 AntiSquid: they get some benefits like tax cuts or somesuch, didn't read much about it, but there's something they profit off under the guise of just being platforms for social interaction and they breach this by taking sides MSmits
 MSmits: kinda gets you in the mood for some censoring
 meh1001: so they can be a company, only allow what they want, but be liable for what they do allow
 meh1001: or they can be a public forum and suck it up when terrible people say things they disagre with
 meh1001: but you can't be a public forum, and censor views you disagree with, and remain logically consistent
 MSmits: meh1001 its not about agreement mostly
 MSmits: it's about people saying things are fact when they are verifyably not facts
 MSmits: like "massive fraud" in US election
 AntiSquid: but either way twitter / facebook got very political about it
 BoBot: but-but...the reality has a well known liberal bias&#160;;)
 meh1001: Well I mean, I don't think anyone argues that picturs of people murdering other people hsould be taken down... the argument is people believe the censorship happens based on alignment with one side or the other
 MSmits: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CG has mods....just sayin', self policing is a thing... like mIRC back in the day... you make groups and kick out anyone you don't like
 MSmits: yeah  i see it as moderators also
 MSmits: they have rules
 MSmits: you agree with them
 BoBot: @meh1001 if one side likes facts more than the other side, the bias might seem unfair
 BoBot: "damn truth bias"&#160;:/
 BoBot: getting political fast over hear :D
 meh1001: I agree confirmation is  bias, but I don't think you can argue that facebook is a platform for nothing but facts..
 BoBot: already feeling the heat
 meh1001: confirmation bias is 100% a thing** I mean
 iWillKickYourAss: GUY SENSEI
 AntiSquid: not me PatrickMcGinnisII, i mean say what you want to say, but repetitive messages or random stuff like swearing out of nowhere, what's the point of allowing that?
 MSmits: the problem in the US is mostly that if one side lies 1 time out of a 100 and the other lies half the time, everyone is a  liar. There's no sense of degree
 AntiSquid: the other folks on here are more extreme than me imo, they kept kicking some trol with a pikachu avatar, i thought it's funny / amuzing ... so depends
 MSmits: AntiSquid, if trump was a random guy and came on here talking like he does, he'd be gone in 5 minutes 
 AntiSquid: not because of me
 AntiSquid: same for biden
 MSmits: definitely because of you. Or do you generally keep players around that repeatedly say the same stuff in all caps
 MSmits: making no sense
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My 75 year old father got put in FB jail for sharing political satire, sometimes stuff is just funny, people r too serious.  And the dumbing down of society is real.
 BoBot: I had a comparison for that once - people were kicked off a feminist group for talking about issues in an obviously anti-feminist angle, and people cried censorship...and I thought - if someone came on a soccer forum and instead of discussing soccer started shitting on soccer and saying that basketball is the best game in the world and soccer fans are idiots...should they be removed from the forum?
 MSmits: not if they did it in the general discussion forum in their own thread
 BoBot: comparison fitting here - if your forum is made for (mainly) discussing a topic - in CG-s case - bot programming - then spam is obviously going to hurt that goal
 TimberStalker: Big difference between a political group and a soccer group.
 MSmits: the fans are not that different though, these days
 AntiSquid: i mean hate trump w/e, do need better candidates, but how the hell does everyone fail to take into consideration biden is a dementia patient with 2 brain surgeries. dementia patients can deteriorate very fast ... still i see people saying "i still rather vote biden", well in fact no, you're voting for whoever is going to replace him, Kamala
 MSmits: AntiSquid you're right, biden is definitely mentally not as fit as a president should be
 MSmits: but even if you compared  him with trump on just that front
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hey, sometimes you just got to unfriend people, even family... we are responsible for filtering/blocking our own feed, so who gives a damn if people are sharing links to movies like "Vaxxed"
 MSmits: biden comes out far ahead
 AntiSquid: uhm, he might be a vegetable in bed tomorrow .
 BoBot: I am fine with people assuming they voted for Harris :D 
 MSmits: so might trump be
 BoBot: I prefer Harris to Biden
 AntiSquid: see? you are making the same mistake
 PatrickMcGinnisII: youtube whacks documentaries... because of bias too
 MSmits: he cant form coherent sentences almost
 AntiSquid: you never worked with dementia patients, they can really deteriorate very badly&#160;:/
 meh1001: I am glad no matter our political leanings, we all like to write code together xD
 MSmits: AntiSquid, my point is, while biden might get dementia, that's all that might happen. Trump is a disaster on 100 fronts
 MSmits: including the same one 
 AntiSquid: that's some heavy bias
 MSmits: i dont see why
 MSmits: just pick any random tweet
 MSmits: and think about it
 BoBot: wait why do you assume Biden has dementia? do you have medical records?
 MSmits: nah i dont assume
 MSmits: i just see he's an old man 
 MSmits: and that's risky
 MSmits: he stutters so he seems worse than he is really
 AntiSquid: no assumption
 TimberStalker: I mean, you dont really need to assume. You can kinda just see it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: people vote party line... and it's sad, the 2 party system is broken and an illussion of control over our own lives... corps. run the show
 AntiSquid: it's known
 TimberStalker: 2 party system needs to die
 BoBot: so the same risk as with every old person being picked? you do know Trump was the oldest president ever?
 BoBot: @AntiSquid known by whom
 meh1001: I agree with that, 2 party is a sham. It's like the illusion of choice
 MSmits: BoBot yeah it's the same risk
 iWillKickYourAss: let's clash guys
 iWillKickYourAss: nobody here can beat me
 AntiSquid: biden is older
 MSmits: but trump also has some personality disorders that have nothing to do with age
 MSmits: thats the thing
 MSmits: if you cant see the extreme narcisism, you havent been paying attention
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Did you know that if the Queen of England made a statemtn to the effect of "Americans need to overthrow the govt."  We would overthrow the govt.
 AntiSquid: what? 
 MSmits: btw biden is physically healthier
 AntiSquid: i don't see how that's possible, americans are proud of their independence
 BoBot: @AntiSquid no seriously, if something like that was confirmed, a source should be easy to find - you should have statements from his personal doctors on public record... otherwise it is bullshit, because peoples medical records are guarded pretty tightly in the US from what I have heard
 MSmits: google trump running 
 MSmits: and biden running
 AntiSquid: it's bullshit because it's on video and he stutters&#160;?
 MSmits: see which one gives you hits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Elizabeth II geets mad respect here, especially since netflix is airing "The Crown"
 AntiSquid: i don't know anyone who doesn't acknowledge he has dementia
 BoBot: @AntiSquid anyone "diagnosing" people from their public appearances is unreliable, EVEN IF they are professionals in their field
 AntiSquid: you can see the signs and the 2 brain surgeries are fact
 BoBot: @AntiSquid YES, you cannot be honestly serious about diagnosing people from their public speeches?!
 TimberStalker: Didnt biden also pop a blood vessel in his eye during a debate or something?
 AntiSquid: and then the only thing that says he doesn't have it is the media
 MSmits: what i dont understand though AntiSquid, what is your alternative to the media?
 BoBot: wait which other sources of Biden's medical history do you have
 BoBot: looooool
 MSmits: the media are far from perfect, but pretty much any alternative is worse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: They've tried twice really hard to tax the internet, they suck, we pay 3x the going rate for access than most people
 BoBot: dude :D I think that Trump is a narcissist, but I cannot claim that he has a Narcissistic Personality Disorder, because I do not have access to his medical records, and that disorder hardly ever gets diagnosed, because the people who have it do not seek help
 MSmits: same BoBot
 MSmits: but in this case, he reaaaally flaunts the narcisism
 MSmits: it's not subtle at all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Alot of Trumps policies aren't THAT bad comparitavely, but his leadership is sh*t and he's just another profiteer like the rest of them
 BoBot: mental health is complex, diagnosing people if you are not a professional in a clinical setting is damaging to the society, because it hurts and trivializes the already badly stigmatized problems
 AntiSquid: you can think what you want, but biden having mental issues isn't false
 MSmits: they're also not really trumps policies. I never understood the urge to ascribe any policy of a government to its leader
 BoBot: lol yea, why do people still think we have kings
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my father is a PhD brain-picker, he often diagnosis Trump as Narcicist, the pros know... I say "it takes one to know one"  lol
 BoBot: even POTUS is a figurehead
 BoBot: there is no way anyone could actually lead a country on their own
 BoBot: his power is mostly symbolic, and is why picking people from the same demographic into power is also part of the symbolism
 MSmits: AntiSquid i do think he has mental issues, but it's pretty average for someone aged 77
 MSmits: if you know anyone that age in your family, you know they aren't all there, the way they were at 50
 PatrickMcGinnisII: BoBot sorry but the lines between executive/judicial/legislative have been blurred to the point that the Potus almost has complete autonomy
 AntiSquid: depends MSmits 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Biden just does stuff slower and can't 'keep up' witht he fast talkers
 BoBot: I am not saying executive is not powerful in the US, I am saying that POTUS does not hold the power, the administration does
 AntiSquid: some are more lucid
 AntiSquid: some less
 MSmits: you should watch some clips of the way trump talked when he was younger and compare it to now
 AntiSquid: some even work in their 80s
 MSmits: his vocabulary shrunk by a factor of 4 or something
 TimberStalker: He does that intentionally
 BoBot: Bush did not go to war, Cheney and Rumsfeld went
 TimberStalker: Its easier for people to understand if you dont use complicated words
 MSmits: TimberStalker partially maybe, but it would shine through at times that he can speak "smarter", but he really never does anymore
 BoBot: lol - when one guy stutters, he has dementia, if the other guy fumbles, he is a mastermind
 struct: he should use paint like icebox did to explain beam search to me
 struct: i understood it in 2 minutes
 AntiSquid: wait ... that's derailing it, who said the other is a mastermind&#160;? huh 
 MSmits: I've seen trump rant on for 10 minutes about his toilet not flushing :P
 TimberStalker: a lot of supporters do
 TimberStalker: AntiSquad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ummm, Trump has like 100 criminal charges waiting to be filed on him in NY once he leaves office.
 BoBot: I actually think he is quite funny, he has quite nice zingers
 MSmits: he has some things in common with stand up comedians yeah
 BoBot: mostly hurtful name calling, but the one where he went after Kim Jong Un's weight
 PatrickMcGinnisII: he even said he might have to leaave the US
 MSmits: jokingly, but it's true
 AntiSquid: will he&#160;?
 MSmits: he may have to
 MSmits: Biden cant even pardon him
 MSmits: it's NY state charges
 PatrickMcGinnisII: His campaign manager went to prison for election fraud...then he won, then he pardoned him...he lives near me...the dude is an ass
 BoBot: Biden has said he wont
 BoBot: pardon Trump...but that does not mean he won't
 MSmits: if he does it doesnt matter
 MSmits: they cant pardon state charges
 BoBot: yea I know about state charges
 TimberStalker: Why the hell would Biden pardon Trump?
 MSmits: only federal ones
 MSmits: it's tradition actually
 BoBot: because he was convinced it was better for the country
 PatrickMcGinnisII: After T attacked Biden's family in the debate, no way Biden gives him any slack
 MSmits: pardon your predecessor to gain peace
 lazily.evaluated: STFU\
 PatrickMcGinnisII: personal attacks have no place there
 lazily.evaluated: PLEASE STFU
 Shreklock: biden cheated
 lazily.evaluated: u guys can't code
 Shreklock: i helped him
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl
 lazily.evaluated: whatsoever
 BoBot: lol synchronized trolls
 AntiSquid: see? this is not allowed on CG chat
 BoBot: are you in the same room?
 MSmits: if not, get one
 Shreklock:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: As long as yall support a free internet, we good.&#160;;)
 MSmits: #troll-room
 MSmits: click it
 MSmits: enjoy
 AntiSquid: too random, too nonsensical Shreklock
 Shreklock: pardon?
 AntiSquid: you're pardoned
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Musk launched more Starlink sats yesterday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: trying ti get into Beta
 TimberStalker: I thought starlink already works?
 meh1001: I wonder if that will be available to consumers, or will it be reserved only for commercial/municipal customers..
 BoBot: worldwide Internet coverage sound neat, and a bit sci-fi
 meh1001: I'd love to live in the middle of nowhere long as I could still work remote
 TimberStalker: Its literally meant for normal people who cant get internet
 BoBot: I thought the goal was a bit humanitarian
 BoBot: well, the thought at least :D
 BoBot: if you think of Internet access as a basic right
 TimberStalker: It still costs money.
 BoBot: so does food
 MSmits: anyway, I am getting some sleep. Gn all&#160;:)
 meh1001: interesting, I though I had read it was restricted, but maybe that was just the beta and not the end goal
 AntiSquid: didn't really look much into starlink but from what i understand it's a world wide web of satelites communicating with each other ... how will they avoid collision with newly launched rockets from other countries?
 TimberStalker: End goal of starlink is to provide internet to anyone anywhere
 BoBot: @AntiSquid the space is big... but there have been concerns raised about space debris
 PatrickMcGinnisII: locally, the I.P., is basically a monopoly...$70/mo. is the cheapest
 BoBot: and other issues
 AntiSquid: yes debris too
 TimberStalker: AntiSquid, they plan this all out. Plus, its extremely hard to actually hit a satellite.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: starlink is $100/mo.
 BoBot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome</a>
 AntiSquid: isn't american internet run by a monopoly&#160;? AT&amp;T&#160;?
 BoBot: this is scary, otoh thinking about it in a simulation seems kinda cool :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: IPs won't run fiber optic, so we have to do something
 TimberStalker: I get internet from spectrum.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: soectrum, yup...effective monopoly that i have to reset the router twice a day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er spectrum
 TimberStalker: Also, did you know that there are massive cables that go through the ocean connecting the continents.
 AntiSquid: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: We need fiber optic everywhere
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I worked on Nasa property
 AntiSquid: really?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: space debris is a thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and it sucks
 meh1001: We need deflector shields stat
 AntiSquid: what exactly was your involvement PatrickMcGinnisII?
 meh1001: or I guess we should start with polarized hull plating right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the starlink launches are actually pretty clean, they know the bits that have to come off will decay and burn up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the Chinese, russian, and even japanese are more prone to leaving space junk than we are
 BoBot: the one collision Chinese created on purpose....major dick move...
 AntiSquid: and there might be more in the future
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AntiSquid it was a long time ago, I basically helped people get PhDs.  And I installed stuff at the air force bases.
 AntiSquid: cool . what happened next&#160;? i mean would have tried to get more involved, but that's me
 Random_Stuffs: you guys are old
 PatrickMcGinnisII: After 911 it wasn't fun anymore, got tired of the politics and 50 calibur gun checkpoints
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in 1988, the year I left college the first time, there was a hiring freeze at Nasa... you couldn't get a job pushing a broom at Nasa
 Random_Stuffs: you are 48?
 Random_Stuffs: 50?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, i just turned 50
 TimberStalker: Damn. And im not even 18 yet.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops 1992
 AntiSquid: mhm, i remember all TV channels displayed black screen for 5 minutes to have few moment of silence for americans who died in 911 ... ya i was watching TV a long time ago ... all channels except for some country music one
 BoBot: yea I was like...you left college at 18? :D
 Random_Stuffs: lol
 AntiSquid: US gets a lot of attention
 BoBot: US has too much power :P
 BoBot: attention follows
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did work at Harris and Northrop and got to see alot of machines mfg. parts for planes and helicopters... those companies are all about the benjamins...but not for their employees
 TimberStalker: "the benjamins"
 TimberStalker: what?
 AntiSquid: China gaining a lot of influence and power :thinking:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: $
 TimberStalker: oh
 BoBot: I prefer the EU, but in global politics China is fine as well
 TimberStalker: Thats case china has over a billion people
 TimberStalker: lots of valuable consumers
 AntiSquid: fine as well&#160;? i'm worried
 BoBot: lol that is what I thought would happen - such a controversial statement right :D
 AntiSquid: worried about china, not about your feelings lol
 TimberStalker: You know if you say something bad about chana anywhere in the world, they can legally arrest you if you enter the country?
 BoBot: China's foreign policy is pretty non-interventionist...I hate how they treat their own citizens though
 TimberStalker: China*
 AntiSquid: they have some extradition agreements even with some EU countries, if their citizens speak ill about them while in those countries they can be sent back to china
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Imagin a free internet in china.  Almost went to war over Pacific trade routes...so wierd...it's all boutt he $
 therealbeef: got compilation time down from 120s to 72s :sweat:
 AntiSquid: for now their politics don't affect us much, but that might change
 BoBot: yea, I would hope they will not start intervening as much as some other global powers do...
 AntiSquid: actually they do affect us .
 AntiSquid: i mean they're involved everywhere
 BoBot: no boots on the ground, I cannot deny economic influence of course...
 AntiSquid: yes economic influence and i am sure they try or do actually spy on the rest ofthe world just like the NSA wherever they can
 TimberStalker: China has been building a very strong military.
 AntiSquid: it's a slow start: Hong Kong -&gt; Taiwan -&gt; who knows what's next
 BoBot: do you prefer unilateral power?
 BoBot: less conflict ofcourse
 BoBot: but do you think USA is fit to police the world?
 BoBot: I am more and more sus of that
 AntiSquid: no
 BoBot: actually, I have been sus of that...always?
 AntiSquid: USA did their share of damage
 BoBot: the question is - is China gaining military power bad then?
 TimberStalker: I would say yes. They are much more open on limiting human rights.
 BoBot: (I think it is still, because I am scared of them as well, I just am not 100% sure)
 AntiSquid: i expect US to sort of suicide / fall like Rome ... China will just step in to take over if they can
 BoBot: I think all countries should demilitarize, and USA should show the lead by not spending trillions on military
 BoBot: @AntiSquid that feeling we share
 BoBot: fall of Rome sounds very fitting as a comparison
 therealbeef: Rome situation was a bit different. They were surrounded by locally strong forces and got eaten bit by bit
 therealbeef: USA is interwoven with most of the rest of the world
 therealbeef: they go down we all go down
 AntiSquid: you could argue the same about china in that case since many things are manufactured there ... if they go down we go down 
 BoBot: yea, that is why I support as much independence of EU from USA as well
 therealbeef: I think they are the best friends we can have at the moment though&#160;:-/
 PatrickMcGinnisII: most of us in US are 'modern slaves' just like the rest of the world
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't count anyone as friend ... it's all about businesses, power, money, influence, etc
 therealbeef: true
 therealbeef: it shoudl be about winning contests and having fun
 AntiSquid: if anything they probably try to make others dependant on them by shutting competition down 
 TimberStalker: You dont need to shut down competition
 TimberStalker: look at china
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Our quality of living is only a hair better ... our food is junk, our industry poisons us,  we haven't learned how to live in harmony.  these people have some good ideas...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/">https://www.thevenusproject.com/</a>
 therealbeef: there can be mutual benefit, though, especially if they share values
 BoBot: I like that EU has started taking steps towards tech independence 
 AntiSquid: the air pollution in china is very serious due to their heating system afaik
 AntiSquid: (source: chinese people)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: close to 3B people still cook over wood
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wrap your head around that
 therealbeef: and charcoal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahhh...'open-fires'
 TimberStalker: You just accurately described a grill.
 therealbeef: I find it interesting how the two major forces (CN, USA) in the world both are ok with exchanging human suffering for economic gain. i think this is EU's 'weakness'
 therealbeef: the poverty, despair, if you can close your eyes for that (also politically), it's apparently very beneficial
 BoBot: it is weakness only if your eval function only considers economy as something to optimize
 BoBot: I do not think all people agree, even in those countries
 therealbeef: for sure
 AntiSquid: do you think EU is all sunshine and rainbows?
 therealbeef: relatively, yes
 BoBot: some cynical Wall Street guy asked during Occupy Wall Street - what good have the non 1%ers ever done and he was asked if he liked Beatles? he said yes :D 
 BoBot: I have tried to find the video of that, unsuccessfully
 AntiSquid: how do you feel about Brexit from your country&#160;?
 therealbeef: i completely understand Brexit, I wish we had the balls for it in NL
 BoBot: the same as I feel about Trump getting elected?
 therealbeef: Trump election I also understood / saw it coming&#160;:-)
 BoBot: maybe "USA having too much power" should be amended to "English-speaking countries having too much influence"
 AntiSquid: personally i see downsides in both EU and brexit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Both yall live in better countries than the US imo.  So yall debating stuff is kinda ...well...hilarious
 AntiSquid: better for how long? 
 BoBot: I have still seen some weird adoration of the US in the Netherlands from some people which surprised me :D 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've been to the UK (well b4 the invasion), not the netherlands tho
 AntiSquid: i am not expecting much good to come after the lockdown period
 SandmanSW96: hey all, in the contests, multis, etc, is there a keyboard shortcut/hotkey for "replay in same conditions"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: not aware . maybe try ctrl shift enter 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I couldn't stand the immigrants if I lived there, other friends in big cities over there are absolutely pissed off about the middle east invasion...oh there i go again, sorry - no politics
 SandmanSW96: yeah tried that
 AntiSquid: you could use a macro
 BoBot: sry what now - the Middle East is invading the UK? I thought it was the other way around :D
 BoBot: Tony Blair went to Iraq iirc
 SandmanSW96: well if there is no keyboard combo a macro wouldn't work, just keep kicking myself for debugging code and then hit ctrl enter out of habit lol.  then DOH once I realize it loads a new situation lol
 BoBot: lol "invasion" my ass
 therealbeef: Are things in the USA still as bad as they were portayed in The Wire 10-15 years ago?
 AntiSquid: google macro editor SandmanSW96
 AntiSquid: it would help. a lot with many different things
 AntiSquid: not sure, there might even be a browser addon
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl, yea i need to stay away from politics
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The wire?
 AntiSquid: or you code one yourself :P
 SandmanSW96: well a macro would only work if there is a keyboard shortcut first right?
 AntiSquid: no
 therealbeef: the tv series about Baltimore from 2004-2009
 AntiSquid: you create shortcut through the macro program 
 BoBot: The Wire is on my watch list - my ex suggested that
 SandmanSW96: if it's that much work I will just reach for the mouse and click the damn thing XD
 BoBot: should connect to current police brutality discussions pretty well
 AntiSquid: it's not .
 SandmanSW96: nah I was just wondering about any existing CG ones
 SandmanSW96: no big deal 
 therealbeef: and the current media discussions, and politics discussions actually
 AntiSquid: i mean just initial download and recording of your mouse / keyboard / mousclick whatever 
 SandmanSW96: haha no thanks I prefer not to have keystrokes etc logged
 AntiSquid: but afterwards you could just press 1 button to launch the macro
 SandmanSW96: not that I am doing anything illegal just meh haha I will just click it manually
 SandmanSW96: just easier and faster to type and BLAM ctrl-enter etc
 SandmanSW96: or ctrl-shift-enter like in clashes for test all
 AntiSquid: ya i understand, not that i am illegally selling stuffed hamsters either hehe
 SandmanSW96: just CSR doesn't do the same in multis
 SandmanSW96: er CSE
 BoBot: thx I did not even use Ctrl+Enter myself, though I think I had at one time
 SandmanSW96: *shrugs* lol
 SandmanSW96: no worries lol
 SandmanSW96: the less I have to take my hands off the keyboard the better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The Wire, hmmm drug epidemic WAS bad 25 years ago, lately not so much - they legalized MJ in so many places.  it's not as bad here, I dunno about Baltimore
 BoBot: sounds like a feature they could add :P
 BoBot: I mean do you not have a legalized drug epidemic now? the opioids?
 SandmanSW96: the wire is a prison show
 SandmanSW96: if you were in prison (not misdemeanor jail) for marijuana, you had way more than a nickel bag lol
 AntiSquid: oh damn it's midnight, good night, was talking too long got stuff to do, but too much to worry about thought i only briefly pop in chat and waste few minutes .
 SandmanSW96: but yeah set in baltimore,   but here in arizona woot come new years day recrecational is all good
 SandmanSW96: I am gonna sit on the front porch, private property, and blaze one for every poor one on earth \m/
 BoBot: yea long overdue imo
 SandmanSW96: yeah, colorado set it off
 SandmanSW96: and whats funny there, it happened like I said it would lol,
 BoBot: fucking hell, even caffeine is more addictive imo (from personal experience)
 SandmanSW96: they literally said they had more tax dollars to spend as a result than they knew what to spend it on
 SandmanSW96: here comes the BOOM, so to speak lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i took a road trip to Wa,Or,Ca, and Co... did a bit of sampling about 4-5 years ago... all the new states are gonna see... it's all about the $.  Fl. made medical legal and the politicians screwed it all up
 SandmanSW96: lol I lived in albuquerque nm, about 2 1/2 hours from colorado,
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Corps. take over everything.
 SandmanSW96: and before it was all scag nasty stuff, seeds and stems mostly, then once colorado legalized it all, the quality up there in northern NM went through the roof
 SandmanSW96: I'm just glad tommy chong lived long enough to see it lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I bought property in Co., piece of crap house... then i found out it was a dry county...so i sold it.  Was looking for vacay spot i could rent out, still made a profit... but property prices go thru the roof when rec. hit
 SandmanSW96: yeah I woulda hung onto that land
 PatrickMcGinnisII: homless in Co and Ca. is a big problem
 SandmanSW96: dry or not mountain pine country is prime in the US
 BoBot: wtf googled dry county - you still have prohibition laws in the US?! :D
 SandmanSW96: Bo even in texas it is city to city
 SandmanSW96: lol
 SandmanSW96: like in the Dallas metro area, was a while since I was there, but 4 cities all one right after the other,
 SandmanSW96: dallas wet, grand prairie dry, arlington wet, ft worth dry
 BoBot: omg and now I am reading that there is a constitutional amendment specifically about alcohol
 SandmanSW96: all in the same urban area lol I was like wtf?
 BoBot: jfc USA :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Dallas had a huge drug problem, I knew people who moved there...they all dead.
 SandmanSW96: alot  of major urban areas do, usa or not
 SandmanSW96: though I won't lie it is probably worse here
 SandmanSW96: meth made st louis and kansas city the murder capitols of the US
 PatrickMcGinnisII: people still dying of fentanyl they geet from the dark web...oooh sounds so spooky... 
 SandmanSW96: oh god yeah we get warning ads on the radio about that crap
 SandmanSW96: gimme beer bud and tobacco and I am a happy yank
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 22 yr old kid i taught a bunch of stuff to... fentanyl...dead
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sad
 SandmanSW96: yeah fentanyl sp? is a stupid problem to have
 SandmanSW96: at least green is just burning a plant
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but try getting a pain-killer from a dr. even tho I'm a broken down old man... nope... BS
 IfIHadATail: yeah I had surgery and they wouldn't even give me enough for the pain. it was BS
 SandmanSW96: hehe patrick mcginnis I would say to ya like I say at the end of the  work day, gonna go home and put some beer on my back
 SandmanSW96: sometimes it goes the other way around though
 IfIHadATail: and they treated me like a criminal everytime I went to fill my garbage perscription
 SandmanSW96: I went to the VA hospital in phoenix for a broken wrist,
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MJ is not a cureall, but face it - people need anti-depressants in the F U world
 SandmanSW96: they gave me vicodin without even telling me
 IfIHadATail: lol 
 SandmanSW96: next thing I know I am looking up at the sky and bleeding because I smacked my head on a brick window ledge, didn't feel a thing
 IfIHadATail: yeah I don't have that problem lol
 Car_sad_car: Hello. Is someone have problems with site connection?
 SandmanSW96: got back to my apt, looked in the mirror, and I looked like an extra from the walking dead lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't get safe stuff... system is broken
 IfIHadATail: sorry no dite problems for me
 IfIHadATail: site*
 SandmanSW96: went BACK to the same sorry VA hospital for stitches
 PatrickMcGinnisII: We now live in a DIY community, 'cause you can't get what you need thru the 'system'
 SandmanSW96: 2018 sucked ass lol
 SandmanSW96: well screw pharmaceuticals for sure
 SandmanSW96: I am not even gonna take this damn vaccine when they do put it out
 SandmanSW96: and I am not anti vaccine I just don't trust whatever they are up; to
 IfIHadATail: don't worry I'll take an extra one for you
 IfIHadATail: XD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: A set of people dying of cancer wanted to grow their own pot, they were all on fixed incomes.  they put a few of them in jail... like they are dying - leave the the f alone
 SandmanSW96: lol
 SandmanSW96: I would have gotten it by now, might have for all I know
 SandmanSW96: patrick yeah for sure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if someone isn't making a profit, they shut that stuff down
 SandmanSW96: out here it's remote enough ppl can get away with it at least without any problems
 SandmanSW96: haven't gotten mine yet but ex military automatically qualifies you for a medical card in alot of states lol.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they all suck:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker">https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2020/3/covid-19-vaccine-tracker</a>
 IfIHadATail: I live in california so I haven't had tha problem for a long time now :P
 SandmanSW96: I look at it like a flu shot,
 SandmanSW96: I take the shot, THEN I get sick, no thanks
 SandmanSW96: let the high risk ppl have em I will be fine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: dispensary stuff is still way expensive
 SandmanSW96: yeah it can be
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't even get flower in my county with a med. card...just edibles and tinctures
 SandmanSW96: but even before rec was starting to get legalized, out in the borderland it's like jaywalking
 IfIHadATail: yeah but so is the cost of getting a misdemeanor :P 
 IfIHadATail: yeah it was pretty hard to get a cop pissed at you enough to write you up for it
 SandmanSW96: nah if you don't have at least an ounce on you in a major urban area in az, new mexico, they don't give a shit
 BoBot: yea it is just not worth it in many jurisdictions in EU as well
 IfIHadATail: I remember when a cop made my dump mine out and gave me my pipe back :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: look at the ingredients of some of these tinctures... might as well blaze
 SandmanSW96: yeah bo for sure, like you cross into utah out here you will probably do months plural with a bowl worth
 SandmanSW96: then into nevada and pffft lol they don't care either
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You can buy an automatic switchblade in Utah, but not ... nevermind, just funny 
 IfIHadATail: yeah my buddy went to the river with his not thinking about it and he got in trouble on the nevada side of the river and threw the book at him
 IfIHadATail: he was pissed lol
 SandmanSW96: lol I was living in south carolina, and still have the switchblade in my center console in my car
 SandmanSW96: which turns out, was a no no in SC
 SandmanSW96: but I still have and had an AZ plate on my car,
 SandmanSW96: so the laws of that state apply if the registration hasn't expired lol
 IfIHadATail: lol got lucky :P
 Recovery_disaster: my test cases are taking minutes to complete. IS there server maintance ongoing?
 SandmanSW96: which means if I had a new mexico current plate,
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't carry my $400 blade I bought in Utah legally in fla. w/o having my weapons permit on me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 SandmanSW96: I could have a loaded 45 on the dashboard and would be good to go :laughing:
 SandmanSW96: lol you need a permit for a knife?
 CobaltMEN: same here, test cases taking a long time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: switchblade, yes
 IfIHadATail: ironically I'd proobablly get shot for that
 SandmanSW96: hahaha wtf
 SandmanSW96: name me one innocent bystander that got hit by a blade  (I am sure it happens)
 IfIHadATail: lol no but you know how it is
 SandmanSW96: but that's ridiculous lol
 SandmanSW96: I am kind of biased though, it is still alot of the old west out here
 BoBot: @SandmanSW96 maybe in an action movie :D
 BoBot: where they actually throw them
 SandmanSW96: lol bo one of the things to make an assault rifle illegal is a bayonet mount *facepalm*
 PatrickMcGinnisII: same license to carry a 9mm as a switchblade...hmmm
 SandmanSW96: name ONE gangbanger who ever used a bayonette lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all about the $
 IfIHadATail: yeah old west by with over population issues XD
 SandmanSW96: nah not in the smaller places
 SandmanSW96: plus tons of room to grow
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Ever chase off someone with a machete?  that's legal...rofl
 SandmanSW96: but they are turning phoenix into another los angeles ugh
 IfIHadATail: lol on reddit a while ago there was someone that posted criminal and the old timey weapons found them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I looked at land in NM, almost bought it too... kinda off grid...didn't buy it... no internet
 IfIHadATail: it was hilarious highly doubt I could ever find it again 
 SandmanSW96: lol been a while since I looked at the actual state statutes, but you wanna know what the ONLY law on the books was in NM the last time i saw, about when it comes to a home invasion?
 IfIHadATail: found on them*
 SandmanSW96: born/raised mostly in NM btw hehe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Had a friend in Albequerque, had one of them good govt. jobs ... MFr disappeared, never heard/saw of him again
 IfIHadATail: no clue
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what SandmanSW96?
 SandmanSW96: ah shoot, he might have been put on an even better govt job then and had to break ties
 SandmanSW96: well ok in NM, the last I saw, about a decade or so ago(and I doubt it changed much),
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly jumped in a stargate or some shit, lol
 SandmanSW96: hahaha never know
 IfIHadATail: that suck had I known I had to join the milltary to use a stargate I would have joined ages ago
 SandmanSW96: but so there, "property" refers to your home, your land, or your vehicle.  and if it is even a rental if it is your residence same rule(s) applied
 SandmanSW96: the ONLY law on the books,
 SandmanSW96: was that "if it can be determined that the individual is attempting to vacate said property, lethal force is not allowed' 
 SandmanSW96: in laiman's terms, you can't shoot them in the back, willingly or be "proven" you did lol
 IfIHadATail: so basically you can't shoot someone in the back?
 IfIHadATail: lol yeah
 SandmanSW96: go figure, for all the guns, etc,
 SandmanSW96: comparatively it's one of the lowest home invasion rates in the US lol
 SandmanSW96: because you are just that STUPID to kick someone's door in out there lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Threshold common law here.  if you shoot them outside...drag them inside, u good.
 IfIHadATail: lol RIP
 SandmanSW96: lol amen, it's your word against that dumb asshole, oh wait, he can't talk anymore
 SandmanSW96: I don't know what may have changed recently,
 IfIHadATail: this got pretty daark for codingame chat lol
 SandmanSW96: but that was literally the ONLY law on the books 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Actually, they have stand your ground law here...they basically made it legal to go snipe hunting
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it sure did
 SandmanSW96: yeah we kinda have the same thing, but it's just the notion that you are actually in real danger
 SandmanSW96: like a guy pulls a knife on you, you can shoot him lol
 MadKnight: but what if an unarmed guy pulls a gun on u
 SandmanSW96: but just blasting on an unarmed man at a circle K not so much
 MadKnight: (that's a reference)
 SandmanSW96: lol mad then he ain't unarmed anymore
 SandmanSW96: game on lol
 MadKnight: tell that to the news
 MadKnight: (PM)
 SandmanSW96: yeah and the other side of that coin,
 BoBot: "I mean what kindofa man would they think I am if I didn't shoot people who touch my stuff?" 
 SandmanSW96: if a cop is about to pull a gun on you,
 MadKnight: PM SandmanSW96
 SandmanSW96: do NOT reach for your phone or wallet lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MadKnight you put the throw away gun in his hand i guess
 MadKnight: private msg
 SandmanSW96: ah crap mad, I closed it by accident, send again?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MadKnight you trying to hack everyone again?
 SandmanSW96: nah just a jpg
 SandmanSW96: which I couldn't load lol
 BoBot: yea do not trust links from MadKnight
 MadKnight: it's a news link
 MadKnight: do u know TheDailyCaller?
 BoBot: I do not know how he hacked that Moderator sign next to his name
 MadKnight: ask icebox
 SandmanSW96: lol mad that pic,
 SandmanSW96: reminds me of how back in the day toy guns that looked real were banned
 SandmanSW96: now airsoft guns look like actual m4's
 SandmanSW96: and go figure in a half second or less to decide, real bullets fly
 BoBot: "yea, if your gun looks like something that can kill people, it better be able to!"
 SandmanSW96: lol if it looks real enough I am not gonna roll the dice and wait to see
 MadKnight: no PatrickMcGinnisII we're discussing a taboo topic
 SandmanSW96: lol it's not so much taboo in certain parts of the US
 SandmanSW96: texans think they should be able to carry AK's into walmart, california thinks you shouldn't be allowed to have a cigarette on the 2nd floor of your own apartment outdoors, new mexico just facepalms
 MadKnight: only in certain partis
 MadKnight: parts
 SandmanSW96: lol this makes me wanna listen to/watch the vid for toby keith's "american ride"  pretty much roasting all of it
 BoBot: sounds like a catch22 - I want to smoke, but I might get shot for reaching for the lighter...
 SandmanSW96: lol bo that would be if you were black and anywhere north of the red river or east of the mississippi, or pretty much anywhere in cali
 BoBot: wait cali is worse with regards to that? :O
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the popo used to be just policing for profit, now they enofrce feelings too.&#160;;)
 MadKnight: BoBot whose alt areu&#160;?
 SandmanSW96: well there is still a difference between real cops and pigs, and the pigs gottta go
 BoBot: @MadKnight alt? I have been here under this name for ~4 years, on and off :P
 BoBot: mostly off in the last 2
 SandmanSW96: lol MK remembers me as sandman I am sure, just different suffixes 
 MadKnight: there are lots of places with lots of pigs making others' lives worse
 SandmanSW96: oh no doubt
 MadKnight: yea i do remember
 SandmanSW96: but not 100% of cops are pigs, unless you are in riyahd or pyongyang or something lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: SandmanSW96 true, making a mistkae is ok, making a mistake that costs someone their life...well, not so much.  Since the riot in Tampa, they changed the local ordinances again.
 MadKnight: eminem was trying to stay up-to-date so his last song contains reference to that cop
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Facemask enforcers seem to be everywhere
 MadKnight: as well as a reference to the quarantine
 MadKnight: BoBot hmm i haven't seen u much when there were no contests
 BoBot: yea I pop on mostly for contests :D
 BoBot: that's how it is :D
 MadKnight: BoBot PM&#160;?
 SandmanSW96: yeah any huge disturbance can get outta hand.  when the red sox wont the world series,
 BoBot: oh sry
 SandmanSW96: that girl got shot with a riot control paintball in the eyeball, got a hemmerage and died
 SandmanSW96: and that was just celebrating
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think I figured out my bandas bitboard
 SandmanSW96: lol yeah let's talk code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but now my dinner is out of the oven
 SandmanSW96: lol or that too
 SandmanSW96: I know I get vocal on that kinda stuff online, mostly just to try to bring logic to some middle ground.  it is way too easy to let things spin outta control one way or the other, just look at our last f'ing election *facepalm*  I thought I was embarassed when "we" voted him IN...  I am so ashamed of 49.9% of my country once again
 TimberStalker: nice "middle ground" you got there
 SandmanSW96: trying to make sense of it all
 SandmanSW96: both sides are guilty of enflaming things, but the "voter fraud" orale... not gonna spark that one up in here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have friends on all sides.  One almost got arrested harassing people at a polling place.  Some are just morons.
 SandmanSW96: yeah
 SandmanSW96: counterproductive as hell
 TimberStalker: Maybe this "election fraud" will get dragged out for four years just like the last one.
 SandmanSW96: like the anarchists in phoenix who smashed in windows and didn't even loot because of the "guy in minnesota the cops killed" and probably couldn't even tell you his name
 SandmanSW96: I never said there was fraud, that ninja got his ass stomped lol
 SandmanSW96: never thought I would miss Bush Jr
 SandmanSW96: but by comparison, tap dancing jehova
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DqoQq1zME8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DqoQq1zME8</a>
 SandmanSW96: lol patrick
 SandmanSW96: so..... how about that power of thor? pretty tricky eh?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ep2 yes
 SandmanSW96: ah yeah I should give that one a shot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a little like code v zombies
 SandmanSW96: I hit a roadblock on APU2 first time here, and never got over it since I had work, then so many more contests and multis
 PatrickMcGinnisII: apu2?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII scratching head</b></p><p><img src="/a/47384461132252" /> SandmanSW96: yeah the matrix one
 SandmanSW96: a hashi puzzle "there is no spoon"
 iWillKickYourAss: that "Bob and Alice" question is stupid
 SandmanSW96: its in the hard puzzles I think
 SandmanSW96: haha willkick yeah
 SandmanSW96: if N&gt;M blah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh i never did ep2
 SandmanSW96: my least fav is height of the ball
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 SandmanSW96: which is n*64 if you ever come across it, so done to death I will gladly risk spoiling it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u do Ghost in the cell?  that's my fav contest
 SandmanSW96: I don't think I tried that one yet, trying to focus on one at a time
 SandmanSW96: hey the most recent, they immediately posted it in multis,
 SandmanSW96: does it carry your existing code over? or do you have to start from scratch again?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that's the first time i think they ported the code over automatically
 SandmanSW96: thats cool
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i usually had to copy/paste it
 SandmanSW96: other ones, I had to reboot it, which can be good but not if you hadn't saved it elsewhere
 SandmanSW96: nothing wrong with ref***ulating existing code but not if you can't glance over the old stuff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think u get xp when u submit a bot the first time in a multi... so i think we missed out on some free xp there
 TimberStalker: what is a multi?
 SandmanSW96: yeah but still alot is given in clashes, but I haven't been around this much in a while so no clue
 SandmanSW96: timber a multi is a bot challenge, that has league levels
 SandmanSW96: all PVP
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have to rewrite challenge anyways, it can wait tho
 TimberStalker: oh ok
 SandmanSW96: most if not all are old contests, like the one that just wrapped up the other day
 SandmanSW96: my first acct here made it from silver to gold in CSB while I was afk for like a month lol
 SandmanSW96: came back and bob was congratulating me :laughing:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: submit some bots, rank up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fall challenge cost me like 20 places
 PatrickMcGinnisII: haven't done Yinsh, but that is struct's fault...smh
 SandmanSW96: yeah alot of scoring used to come from clashes but I do love how these folks are on the ball and keep changing it up
 struct: why? PatrickMcGinnisII?
 struct: :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, cause u made it so complicated
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :P
 struct: Yeah, it was hard
 struct: I used game notation
 MadKnight: struct
 MadKnight: so what happened&#160;?
 MadKnight: i have no idea
 MadKnight: something absolutely random
 JohnCM: hey all... how do you make the blue text in the problem statement?
 JohnCM: like output 'True'
 JohnCM: i'm creating a CoC

 MadKnight: JohnCM still there&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a href="/index.php?title=Template:Text&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Text (page does not exist)">Template:Text</a>
 JohnCM: ok
 JohnCM: yup
 JohnCM: yes <a href="/index.php?title=Template:Text&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Text (page does not exist)">Template:Text</a> did the trick
 MadKnight: PatrickMcGinnisII PM&#160;?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: what is <a href="/index.php?title=Template:Text&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Text (page does not exist)">Template:Text</a>
 Rodrigo_the_coder:&#160;???
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i'm so lonely...:(
 miszu: whatsup
 Rodrigo_the_coder: what is <a href="/index.php?title=Template:Text&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:Text (page does not exist)">Template:Text</a>
 miszu: no idea, I just arrived
 Rodrigo_the_coder: fall challenge has ended, lets play CSB
 miszu: you don't play CSB
 miszu: you code a bot and let it play
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i couldn't pass bronze&#160;:(
 miszu: try new strategy
 Rodrigo_the_coder: targ3-vel?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: nope
 Rodrigo_the_coder: ...
 miszu: to reach higher level, you need to read a lot of strategies and algorithms
 Rodrigo_the_coder: lonely again&#160;:(
 Rodrigo_the_coder: why only miszu chat
 Rodrigo_the_coder: where are the others&#160;:(
 miszu: they left
 Rodrigo_the_coder: :sob:
 Rodrigo_the_coder: check the person icon beside settings
 Rodrigo_the_coder: in the bottom
 miszu: yeah I know
 Rodrigo_the_coder: they are most likely busy coding around
 miszu: for sure
 Rodrigo_the_coder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5a7cdf5-35fc-4c6f-84bd-4053be21ae8d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c5a7cdf5-35fc-4c6f-84bd-4053be21ae8d</a>
 Rodrigo_the_coder: do you understand this? improve it
 Rodrigo_the_coder: :sob: the most lonely coder is: me!!!
 JohnCM: lol
 JohnCM: if i'm not wrong, a series of if else for thrust can get you into silver alr
 Rodrigo_the_coder: thx
 Rodrigo_the_coder: u mean if elif else
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i tried, but failed to defeat Boss 4

 Rodrigo_the_coder: hey
 Rodrigo_the_coder: u there
 Rodrigo_the_coder:&#160;:(
 miszu: JohnCM hey how you doing?
 JohnCM: still an if else
 JohnCM: doing fine haha
 JohnCM: i've been blitzing CoC
 miszu: what you working on?
 JohnCM: soon gonna be top 100 alr
 JohnCM: just submitted two CoC contributions for review
 miszu: ah nice
 miszu: that's good
 JohnCM: you?
 miszu: working on my UTTT
 JohnCM: haha i've been too lazy to start the puzzles
 JohnCM: what's uttt
 miszu: utliamate tic tac toe
 miszu: 40th in gold and making a push to legendary
 miszu: but I am rewriting my code in visual studio and using unit test for correctness
 JohnCM: that game is hard
 JohnCM: i got stuck at bronze
 JohnCM: you used mcts?
 miszu: yeah mcts
 Cheekycoder: hey guys
 miszu: basic mcts put you out of bronze
 miszu: kinda optimized mcts put you out of silver
 miszu: super optimized will bring you to legend
 JohnCM: i used mcts
 JohnCM: but i did in python
 JohnCM: only can go depth 5-6 + needed heuristics
 miszu: c++ my friend&#160;:)
 JohnCM: guess i should recode in c++
 Cheekycoder: i don't under stand any thing like what to type and what it means
 miszu: I use visual studio and write unit tests
 Lysk: in C++?
 miszu: I want to make sure my states are working properly
 miszu: yeah
 JohnCM: ha what unit tests?
 miszu: hi lysk
 miszu: haha
 Lysk: nice nice
 miszu: unit test is like writing code to test your code
 JohnCM: i know
 JohnCM: but like what kind
 miszu: ohh
 miszu: example
 Cheekycoder: you guys now how to code right?
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47719c54-65a3-4908-aa10-26be5884a599">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47719c54-65a3-4908-aa10-26be5884a599</a>
 Rodrigo_the_coder: will MCTS help me on CSB
 Zenoscave: no Rodrigo_the_coder
 Zenoscave: wrong domain for the usecase
 miszu: this test tests a win state and make sure the states are also correct
 Rodrigo_the_coder: what language is this?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47719c54-65a3-4908-aa10-26be5884a599">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/47719c54-65a3-4908-aa10-26be5884a599</a>
 miszu: C++
 Rodrigo_the_coder: thx man
 Rodrigo_the_coder: is it UTTT
 miszu: yeah
 Lysk: have tried a c++ profilier, I have that on my todo list
 Lysk:&#160;?
 miszu: never used a profiler
 miszu: I think most people's problem is they don't have correctness of their code
 miszu: a hidden bug separates them from next league
 Rodrigo_the_coder: uttt wood python
 Rodrigo_the_coder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f34a193f-3253-4b3e-8c8b-a79e890b0038">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f34a193f-3253-4b3e-8c8b-a79e890b0038</a>
 Lysk: right
 miszu: so I changed my mindset and test my code
 miszu: my mcts pick a branch with 80% win rate but loses
 Rodrigo_the_coder: in python, to get out of uttt wood in python is print(row, col)
 miszu: rarely but it does that
 Lysk: Anyone fwith feedback wether or not it's worth having the potion bonus price in the simu?
 Lysk: eg: after brewing potion at index 0, the potion at index 1 has as price: price -1 +3\
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lysk I think the bonus is in the input data
 Lysk: yup it is, I was curious to see if it was useful to have same bonus calculation deeper in the simu
 Lysk: say you brew the first potion at depth 3, should the price for the potions be updated when calculating score/action at depth 4+
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I doubt anyone bothered
 JohnCM: yea just use potion bonus price
 JohnCM: chances are, things won't have changed by the time you reached that state, if you are optimal enough
 Lysk: when planing on 30+ turns it could make a difference

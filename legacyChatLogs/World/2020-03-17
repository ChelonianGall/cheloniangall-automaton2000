 EmilHuzell: has anyone solved shadows 2 using trilateration?
 TheWaterCooledSkater_cead: i,m a newer and i wangt to make some progress
 TransExterminator: poop
 5IGI0: oh&#160;! hein voilà
 TransExterminator: go on codeforces there are better problems there
 5IGI0: hm
 5IGI0: give link pls
 TransExterminator: im talking to other guy
 TransExterminator: just google it
 lotosmui: how i know if the id on the loop is my id?
 struct: what game?
 lotosmui: platinum rift
 lotosmui: episode 2
 struct: they give you your id
 struct: at the start of the game
 struct: on first turn

 struct: Hello AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by that to me?
 Uljahn: AutomatonNN: that means you should invite euler to coc
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to learn to code in the code and the last case will be the same as the 
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 struct: poor euler&#160;:(
 struct: euler should make a bot that every time AutomatonN N pings him, the bot would ping Magu s
 Uljahn: wasn't it Agad e's before?
 struct: I think soi
 struct: Well just ping both
 struct: or ping everyone at #fr
 jang888: Will i have band if i hardcode?
 struct: you mean ban?
 struct: if you mean ban, you wont get banned
 struct: But your solution wont pass the validators
 struct: Unless you hardcode the validators
 wlesavo: i guess there are some puzzles where you can watch the replay from validators, although in these puzzles it is easier to actually solve them then to hardcode
 jang888: thank
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: Well sim is finished
 struct: Finally
 struct: Time to delete&#160;:'(
 Uljahn: delete what? the acc?
 struct: Yes
 struct: I said 1 mill sims or delete
 eulerscheZahl: how many do you get?
 struct: worst case 600k
 eulerscheZahl: best case?
 struct: best case 2mill
 eulerscheZahl: fair enough, for me that counts
 eulerscheZahl: you can keep your account for now
 eulerscheZahl: but you have to reach UTG legend when it's added
 struct: :cold_sweat:
 struct: ofc these numbers are without eval
 struct: and just random search
 Uljahn: with avx?
 struct: yes
 struct: using floats, not doubles
 struct: also my sine and cosine are not equal to normal
 struct: They are close enough though

 struct: I think euler linked it before
 Uljahn: you can cache trigs i guess
 Uljahn: when an action space is 0, 200 for thrust you can precalculate all 200*cos(angle) and 200*sin(angle) with angle being int in degrees
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: I dealt with the vanishing avatars
 eulerscheZahl: a local copy
 dbdr: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: and now you have to do the same with pastebins :P

 dbdr: meaning I will have the history of everyone's avatars&#160;:)
 dbdr: yeah, I did it for pastebins already
 eulerscheZahl: oh nice
 dbdr: not accessible yet, but they are stored
 dbdr: do you know how long they stay?
 dbdr: oh, you linked to an old one?
 eulerscheZahl: 0s worst case
 dbdr: wat?
 eulerscheZahl: no, i added some newlines
 eulerscheZahl: created one
 eulerscheZahl: no idea how long the remain
 eulerscheZahl: the 0s is when they are broken again
 dbdr: ah :D
 eulerscheZahl: were you on CG already when we had sad times without emojis?
 eulerscheZahl: once they broke too
 dbdr: added benefit is the space savings
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?title=Chat:World/2020-03-15&amp;action=history">https://cg.spdns.eu/index.php?title=Chat:World/2020-03-15&amp;action=history</a>

 eulerscheZahl: and another benefit: the search results are less cluttered
 dbdr: yep&#160;:)
 dbdr: JFB, if you're there: I set the lang now
 dbdr: you can get your automated translation
 dbdr: with chrome only by default I think, not FF
 eulerscheZahl: wow, great
 dbdr: wrote an extension that sets the language based on the page title
 Nixerrr: Holy cow, euler is #1. Congrats!
 struct: Nixerrr long time no see
 Nixerrr: :wave: struct
 wlesavo: holy bulls and cows, you gotta be politically correct nowadays :wink:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: hey Nixerrr!
 Nixerrr: Hey hey
 Nixerrr: My gym closed so I might return to CG :D
 YurkovAS: struct you use avx same?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/robostac/cg-meanmax-postmortem">https://github.com/robostac/cg-meanmax-postmortem</a>My implementation runs 8 different games in parallel, so you can try 8 different moves at once and evaluate them. This gave a speed up of 5-6x in CSB.
 RoboStac: it's great for ga style solutions, a complete pain for mcts based ones (eg smitsi)
 struct: yes
 eulerscheZahl: thanks Nixerrr (and welcome back)CG changed their ranking formula, that's how i got there
 eulerscheZahl: and today i started Cultist Wars :tada:
 struct: why do you think is a pain for MCTS RoboStac?
 struct: You cant really avx the tree
 YurkovAS: RoboStac you current csb bot without avx and 1 mil sim?
 struct: is that why?
 RoboStac: it's hard to make use of parallel games efficiently 
 RoboStac: as you need a way to not just generate the same game 8 times from the tree
 struct: True, but still possible
 struct: I guess the gains will decrease a bit though
 RoboStac: my current bot is avx enhanced but not parallel games - just doing all the collision checks at once etc
 RoboStac: I had better results with that  than parallel games
 YurkovAS: RoboStac thanks. I use avx in uct formula and pod end move (round, trunc), but it give very small benefit.
 struct: I see, I will try this way though
 struct: to see how it goes
 struct: Do you load the values YurkovAS?
 struct: also I found that if I use avx flags on my none avxed code
 struct: I still gain a bit of performance
 struct: due to auto vectorization
 struct: small boost
 struct: 10%-20%
 YurkovAS: struct I use sse (not avx): _mm_set_ps and for read - union { __m128 v; float a[4]; }

 AntiSquid: how is life?
 AntiSquid: need to go shopping, wonder if there's anything on the shelves :thinking: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: well you don't have the time yet
 TransExterminator: struct are you talking about c
 TransExterminator: my favourite
 struct: c++
 TransExterminator: what  about cpp are u talking about
 struct: We were talking about AVX
 TransExterminator: to do what
 struct: to  apply it on CSB
 struct: coders strike back
 TransExterminator: lol
 AntiSquid: how's your CSB TransExterminator?
 TransExterminator: if only they used clang
 AntiSquid: did you fix it?
 TransExterminator: fix what
 Astrobytes: it
 TransExterminator: what
 AntiSquid: your CSB bot
 AntiSquid: fix it TransExterminator
 TransExterminator: im new
 AntiSquid: that's the best time to fix it, when you're sitll new
 TransExterminator: i signed up yesterday i will check it out
 TransExterminator: ok
 TransExterminator: where is it
 AntiSquid: just do Vindinium instead:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/vindinium">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/vindinium</a>
 AntiSquid: how's your Vindinium TransExterminator?
 TransExterminator: checking it out right now
 TransExterminator: its gcc right?
 TransExterminator: so i can use bits stdc++
 AntiSquid: let us know when you fixed it
 TransExterminator: what is fixed
 TransExterminator: i win the game?
 AntiSquid: get top 10 in Vindinium
 TransExterminator: why
 AntiSquid: i mean reach Wood 1 first
 AntiSquid: then top 10
 TransExterminator: like global top 10?
 AntiSquid: one step at a time
 AntiSquid: top 10 Vindinium
 TransExterminator: how  do i make my thing mobe
 TransExterminator: move
 AntiSquid: using directions:NORTH, EASTH, SOUTH, WEAT
 AntiSquid: WEST *
 TransExterminator: ok
 TransExterminator: that move me one forwars?
 AntiSquid: but you need to choose correct one each turn!
 TransExterminator: how do i know where the enemy is
 AntiSquid: one square at a time
 AntiSquid: it's given in the inputs
 AntiSquid: read the text on the left
 AntiSquid: how's your bot?
 TransExterminator: its standing there doing nothing
 AntiSquid: someone help me give the perfect 5 letter reply?
 Astrobytes: Fix it
 TransExterminator: ok im doing it
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 AntiSquid: when Wood 1?
 TransExterminator: i just started idk what wood is
 struct: :fireworks:
 TransExterminator: how do i get my own x and y position
 struct: Which game?
 struct: Vindinium?
 TransExterminator: vindinium
 TransExterminator: yeah
 struct: I think its given in inputs
 TransExterminator: it said x and y is of the entitiy
 struct: it gives entitytype
 struct: if hero
 TransExterminator: OH
 struct: I think I fixed or broke something
 struct: my sim number increased by quite a bit
 Astrobytes: Defo broken :P
 ronthecookie: im addicted to the clash now.. 2 days in a row...
 BurakEkincioglu: hey is there anyone now&#160;? , it is my first time, it is very interesting for me :D
 TransExterminator: nevermind idk wtf i am supposed to do
 TransExterminator: i am going to do clash of cod
 struct: Wise choice
 Astrobytes: Clash of cod? Fish battling!
 struct: Im gonna create a multi called Clash of Code
 struct: free advertisement
 Astrobytes: Clash of Cod would be better tbh
 Nixerrr: I tried cod several times, but never really acquired a taste for it 
 Nixerrr: Very bland taste and falls apart easily when roasted or fried
 Astrobytes: Only if you overcook it
 Astrobytes: But bland yes, takes strong flavours well
 struct: I havent played it a lot
 struct: only have 3k games I think
 Nixerrr: Astrobytes Right, I might have overcooked it, true
 Nixerrr: Or handled it too much while cooking
 struct: Now I need MSmits
 struct: Now that I finished sim
 Astrobytes: Yeah that would do it NixerrrGoes well with chorizo if you like that
 Nixerrr: Yeah I like chorizo a lot
 Astrobytes: When I used to eat that kinda thing I liked a bean + chorizo stew with pan-fried cod
 Nixerrr: Not anymore?
 Nixerrr: Went vegan?
 Astrobytes: Vegetarian these days
 Nixerrr: I usually like fish with more character and fat. Had carp the other day, it was great
 Astrobytes: Yeah, carp's nice. The oily fish have more flavour usually 
 Astrobytes: But the more bland white fish like to be paired with strong flavours. Cod is nice in a curry for instance
 AntiSquid: why the chorizo? i get it it's much beloved ingredient, but you could just use paprika powder / tomato sauce and some other spices with the cod herbs . lemon . garlic 
 AntiSquid: also maybe this is a time in life where one might consider begging as a necessity
 AntiSquid: begging for toilet paper
 Astrobytes: You could also do that yea
 Astrobytes: These days I substitute chorizo with smoked paprika
 TransExterminator: smoked paprika in soup is very good
 TransExterminator: in chili or some thick starch soup 
 AntiSquid: got the perfect money making idea:giant easter chocoloate egg with a toilet roll inside! i bet it would sell like crazy
 5IGI0: oxford '-'
 5IGI0: you're a asshole's bourgeois
 AntiSquid: there is no middle class
 AntiSquid: just the poor commoners, the super piss poor commoners doing drugs and then all the rich classes and above
 Uljahn: ah, those pesky russian oligarchs
 romrd468: What is the latest python libraries?
 romrd468: A lot of the ones I was finding online were dead libraries.
 struct: What do you mean by dead?
 MadKnight: rip
 MadKnight: it means when u include them your code outputs F
 MadKnight: and then they do nothing
 MadKnight: what is the latest py library, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: not trying to get from bronze to gold
 MadKnight: just open github, sort repositories by latest commit date and filter them by py3
 MadKnight: ezpz
 romrd468: fudge another list of dead libraries or ones that are not functioning

 MadKnight: struct how's your float hacking&#160;?
 struct: haven't started
 MadKnight: just set its value manually struct
 Scarfield: float hacking?
 Scarfield: param fitting?
 MadKnight: no he needs to generate random from 0 to 1 without any float operations
 MadKnight: he only got bitwise 
 MadKnight: i told him he can manually set first 9 bits and randomize the other 23
 TransExterminator: why do floats lose precision?
 Astrobytes: Cause they float. They all float down here.
 MSmits: :balloon:
 MSmits: :clown:
 struct: hello there MSmits
 struct: My avx sim is finished for the most part
 MSmits: cool
 struct: and my account still remains
 struct: at least for now
 MSmits: why wouldn't it
 Astrobytes: Sim count &gt; 1 mil?
 struct: in most cases yes
 MSmits: awesome
 Astrobytes: With eval?
 struct: nah
 Astrobytes: It still counts no?
 struct: without eval I get around worst case 700-800k 
 struct: best case now I get 2.5mill
 struct: after some changes
 Astrobytes: Good enough if you ask me
 MSmits: yes
 struct: this with floats
 MSmits: lol Astrobytes, you made me nr 1 oware
 struct: by quite a bit
 MSmits: nah, that's still within the margin 
 MSmits: i am guessing Astrobytes chose some params that are somewhat hurtful to re curse
 struct: wasnt roy ale that pushed you?
 MSmits: yea i just checker
 MSmits: royale did it
 MSmits: astro pushed all of us equally
 MSmits: but royale royally screwed re curse
 struct: Im hyped to see his new version
 MSmits: you mean the csb?
 MSmits: oh re curse
 struct: yes
 struct: re curse
 MSmits: it's not gonna be much different, it's gonna whack everyone, including me, but when I submit a new version it could be different again
 MSmits: unless he somehow made himself immune to new params
 Astrobytes: My bot did Robo
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: so you and royale tag teamed the nns
 Astrobytes: Yeah, was a battle royale 
 MSmits: hehe
 Astrobytes: I don't want to see that game for at least another day
 struct: also it seems that avx doesnt work very well with trees like smitsimax
 MSmits: yeah I am not enjoying it much anymore
 MSmits: why not struct
 struct: robo says he uses avx only to resolve collisions
 struct: I think it can still work
 MSmits: but you just said you got millions of sims
 struct: havent tried
 struct: yes but node selection isnt so straightforward
 struct: Ill need like current[pods][8]
 MSmits: ah
 _Royale: Astrobytes: lol&#160;:) yeah I submitted a lot today
 MSmits: hey there _Royale
 _Royale: hi MSmits!
 Astrobytes: _Royale yeah me too lol, you win :D
 MSmits: nice to see you all around the community multis 
 MSmits: you did langtons ant right before me
 struct: Where is your yavalath bot?
 _Royale: yeah I had a lot of fun on Langtons too
 MSmits: i had some annoying bugs, but once it worked, it worked really well right away. At least i didn't have so many params, like in oware
 _Royale: and now that we have the lockdown I can spend even more time here&#160;;-)
 MSmits: me too i guess, but also need to do a lot of remote-teaching
 Astrobytes: I'm actually surprised CG isn't more active right now, I guess everyone has a bunch of crap to deal with though
 MSmits: yes, the hunt for toilet paper and all that
 Astrobytes: Don't, I gave my supply to my grandad, down to last roll. A vegetarian with 1 toilet roll is not good :D
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: that's poop-ist
 Astrobytes: I can't be poop-ist to myself
 MSmits: mmh ok
 Astrobytes: Poopism-by-proxy?
 MSmits: I'm just saying, just because they dont eat meat, doesnt mean they dont poop right
 Astrobytes: I'm vegetarian
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: wait, you gave him all but 1 roll?
 Astrobytes: I eat a lot of spicy food
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I mean I only had a pack of 4
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: re curse suggested printing out php code
 Astrobytes: All the people in my town are selfish idiots
 Astrobytes: *Most of
 MSmits: everywhere apparently
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 MSmits: we only have appropriate amounts of toilet paper
 Astrobytes: I get a pack of 4 every other week
 Astrobytes: Sometimes 2 if my sister visits
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: lol...
 Astrobytes: I don't know either. She just gets through it 
 MSmits: gives you a lot of stress I take it
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: I thought you had issues out of stress when she visits
 Astrobytes: That too lol. You can tell she's visited by the reduction in toilet roll 
 struct: remember
 struct: not all toilet rolls are same size
 Astrobytes: She must smoke it or something
 MSmits: struct do you mean they get smaller when you use them?
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: I can tell this is a late night conversation
 Astrobytes: Yep, look at the clock :smirk:
 MSmits: that too
 Astrobytes: But yeah, totally
 MSmits: I need help with Onitama&#160;:(
 struct: How can I explain&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: About toilet roll size?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: We're just kidding
 MSmits: struct isn't
 MSmits: this is serious stuff to him
 Astrobytes: The toilet rolls when I worked in Corfu were much smaller than here
 Astrobytes: What's up with your Onitami MSmits?
 Astrobytes: *Onitama
 MSmits: I'm a bit stuck on figuring out a good bitboard
 MSmits: it's 5x5 so fits easily in 32 bit for either player
 MSmits: I could use a cardpattern and shift it to the right cell
 MSmits: but I dont know what to do about shifts that go over the edge
 struct: so you mean it fits in __mm256i 8 times
 struct: __m256i
 Astrobytes: I've not played it properly yet but the patterns seem easy enough to work with bitboard-wise?
 MSmits: yeah, but that wont be useful to me I think struct
 struct: I also dont think you can avx every multi
 Astrobytes: You can. But it won't benefit you
 MSmits: Astrobytes I thought so too, but say you have a card that moves 2 to the left
 MSmits: that could be a shift of two on the bitboard
 MSmits: however, what if the origin cell is on the left edge of the board
 MSmits: the shift will still happen
 MSmits: and then you go to the next row
 MSmits: but that's incorrect
 Astrobytes: So you need to rotate
 MSmits: in bandas this can easily be solved because you shift 1 at a time
 MSmits: but not in onitama
 Astrobytes: not rotate as in angle
 MSmits: rotate wont work
 MSmits: you can also move 2 vertical
 MSmits: so there will always be a direction in which this happens
 Astrobytes: Hm, yes I see
 MSmits: and i cant rotate every move, because that defeats the purpose of a bitboard, too expensive
 Astrobytes: Yep. Have you tried it without bitboards yet
 MSmits: i've been thinking about just having a lookup array
 MSmits: just take the card and the cell
 MSmits: and lookup the bit pattern
 Astrobytes: That sounds logical
 MSmits: i try to avoid it when i can, because lookup comes with a price also
 MSmits: i dont know how to do it efficiently without a bitboard
 Astrobytes: But play it without any bitboards and see if you can see a way to work them in
 MSmits: I cant save the state on the nodes then
 MSmits: too much data
 MSmits: would be completely different bot
 MSmits: I'll make it work I think. It's just harder than I thought 
 MSmits: I got the framework from my checkers/oware bot
 Astrobytes: 1. Make slow working bot. 2. Make improvements to other bot based on that.3. Profit
 MSmits: just need moves/eval/input/output
 MSmits: i never do that Astrobytes
 MSmits: oware hasnt been optimized after it first started working
 MSmits: only eval changes
 Astrobytes: I know. Sometimes thinking from the ground up lets you see things you might miss
 MSmits: but for me, after writing so many bitboards, it's not really that much easier to do it without them
 MSmits: i'm used to it
 Astrobytes: You'll figure it out
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I'm just whining
 Astrobytes: Better than wheezing
 MSmits: true true
 MSmits: how are you btw
 Astrobytes: Not so bad, just lacking energy, can't stand up for more than 5 minutes, typical 'flu symptoms
 Astrobytes: Not any better, not any worse
 Astrobytes: You and family all good?
 MSmits: it's weird that virus that is more similar to a cold virus has symptoms nearer to a flu
 MSmits: yeah we're fine
 MSmits: i had to go to work quickly today cuz i forgot to pick up a stack of tests =/  Was 2 1/2 hrs, mostly empty train so it was ok
 Astrobytes: It's an interesting little virus that's for sure.Good to hear. Ah, so quiet everywhere you should be gine
 struct: you still go to school?
 Astrobytes: Or fine
 MSmits: i dont exactly "go to " school
 MSmits: the building is almost empty
 MSmits: i just go in, take my sht and leave
 Astrobytes: Use the toilet like everyone else you beast :P
 MSmits: oh, that's right, I could have stolen some rolls
 MSmits: missed opportunity
 MSmits: and, no, I am not using the tests
 MSmits: have some respect!
 Astrobytes: "i just go in, take my sht and leave"...
 MSmits: yea yea
 MSmits: students do not like it when they make a test and you take months to grade it
 MSmits: I couldnt really leave them there ungraded
 Astrobytes: The Phantom Shtter of Old Whatever-Town-It-Is
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: But yeah, definitely the right thing to do
 MSmits: I had a video meeting for my studies todat
 MSmits: my teacher invited a teacher from a different school to talk about their coder class
 MSmits: really awesome, these young students (12 and up) learn coding 5 hrs a week
 Astrobytes: That's awesome
 MSmits: by the time they're 18, they know enough to work at an IT company
 Astrobytes: The only coding experience we ever got was LOGO programming on a BBC Micro in primary school
 struct: MSmits in CSB you use 9 moves right?
 MSmits: well that's the norm in my country in most cases
 MSmits: struct only 7
 MSmits: I did 8 for a while, but 7 worked slightly better
 struct: you dont shield angle?
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: i thought you meant depth
 Astrobytes: Kids can learn so much so young, just a question of allocating resources
 MSmits: in that case, it is only 5 I think
 MSmits: right Astrobytes
 struct: only 5?
 struct: 200 0, 18 -18
 MSmits: yes, maybe 6 sometimes? On average less than 5
 struct: you dont have 
 struct: shield 0 18 -18
 MSmits: 3, 5, or 6 it was i think, depending on circumstances
 MSmits: no shield no, just first layer
 MSmits: so depth 0
 MSmits: because I prune many move sequences, the branching is quite low
 MSmits: I think many attempts at smitsi in csb fail because people try all moves
 MSmits: you cant converge that way
 MSmits: a regular turn has 2 types of power (0 or max) and 3 types of angle (-18,0,18), so max 6 moves
 MSmits: but because many move combinations make no sense, it is on average much less
 MSmits: maybe I should publish my move sequence pruning at some point. it's really effective
 MSmits: more proud of that part than anything else in my bot :P
 struct: isnt it just if you -18 0
 MSmits: no not just that
 struct: you wont 18 0 next turn
 MSmits: there's more
 MSmits: if i do -18 0, i wont allow the following on next turn:
 MSmits: 18 0
 Astrobytes: tech io tuto incoming 
 MSmits: 0 0 
 MSmits: i think also 18 100
 Astrobytes: Makes sense
 MSmits: i think after -18 0 I only allow -18 100 or -18 0
 MSmits: because you do this to take a sharp turn right?
 struct: hmm
 MSmits: so either you keep turning at 0 power, or you start turning with power because you almost finished the turn
 MSmits: let me check it
 MSmits: ah yes
 YurkovAS: MSmits can you share avg count of mcts nodes (moves)?
 MSmits: what i said was correct, just those two moves
 MSmits: so some nodes have branching 2
 MSmits: what does that mean YurkovAS
 MSmits: total nodes in game?
 YurkovAS: yes, i'm try to prune moves, but it not give benefit
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: I dont save the tree
 MSmits: like in mcts, you cant really do that
 MSmits: apparently, most turns I use around 50-60k nodes
 struct: per pod?
 YurkovAS: total or per pod?
 MSmits: total
 YurkovAS: MSmits thanks!
 MSmits: any time
 struct: I guess I know why my smitsimax never worked
 MSmits: oh, sometimes it goes below 40k
 MSmits: probably has to do with collisions
 MSmits: expensive sims
 MSmits: how is that struct?
 struct: I used like 100k nodes 
 struct: oh wait
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: yes, you prune less
 struct: I didnt visit the 100k+ obviously
 struct: but it expanded to that
 MSmits: neither did I
 MSmits: i expand to 40-60k
 MSmits: but I branch less
 MSmits: so i expand less
 MSmits: it's easy to converge when you have very little branching
 YurkovAS: now i use ~500k nodes. min=200k, max=800k.In my case it play better than: 40-80k
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: this is smitsi?
 YurkovAS: yes
 MSmits: crazy, how much depth?
 struct: wtf
 struct: how many sims?
 YurkovAS: top15 :smiley:
 Astrobytes: And this is with AVX on UCT?
 YurkovAS: sims ~300k
 MSmits: how can you get so many nodes?
 MSmits: with the same amount of sims that I get
 YurkovAS: i'm recheck now count of nodes
 struct: oh my
 struct: forget my old number of 100k nodes
 struct: I just checked
 struct: more like 600k-900k nodes for me
 MSmits: is that in a full game or in a turn?
 struct: turn
 struct: with around 170k sims
 MSmits: ok let me check mine then
 struct: This is without pruning
 struct: and allowing shield every turn
 struct: so its like 9 moves per turn at worse
 MSmits: yeah it really is 40-60k for me
 YurkovAS: avg=600k, min=400k, max=1mil nodes total for 4 pods
 struct: that is with pruning YurkovAS?
 YurkovAS: sims 300-400k
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5405535-7a69-422e-9e47-627a0a6c808c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e5405535-7a69-422e-9e47-627a0a6c808c</a>
 YurkovAS: no, with pruning play bad. i'm try to find better result
 MSmits: maybe your pruning has a bug?
 YurkovAS: my bot is bug. when i use ttl=150 vs ttl=75 in brutal tester - they play same. but sims count 2x time more
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: I should stop talking about csb, I dont want to be dragged back into it&#160;:)  Already fighting nn's in oware
 MSmits: I think everything above me in csb is a nn
 MSmits: except iggy maybe?
 struct: I wonder if sims will make a difference
 MSmits: they will
 Astrobytes: Donno about that one, just saw the leaderboard yesterday after a long while
 MSmits: I can go deeper with more sims
 MSmits: or explore more
 MSmits: either way, it helps
 MSmits: also, with avx sim I could defeat that final boss in br2k&#160;:)
 MSmits: being stuck behind a wood boss is embarassing
 Astrobytes: IT's not real wood tho
 MSmits: I know 
 struct: dont make me open yavalath league with undefeatable boss
 Astrobytes: Laminated boss
 MSmits: what would an undefeatable boss look like?
 MSmits: I know one way
 struct: Which way?
 MSmits: make him always be p1, choose middle hex and disallow swap :P
 MSmits: steal I mean
 struct: The referee doesnt know if it is the boss that is playing
 MSmits: oww
 MSmits: well then I got nothing
 Astrobytes: Guess it could if you sent it a signal 
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: a secret signal we can also use&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Is that possible on CG? I know they did similar things in Halite
 struct: Ill send some generated stuff from bot
 struct: to referee
 struct: referee reads and decodes
 struct: if its right its bot
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah it is I think. 
 MSmits: You just need an agreed upon starting sequence
 Astrobytes: Cool
 MSmits: however, people would figure it out and then abuse it
 MSmits: so say, you wanted to boost me in oware
 Astrobytes: Half the fun tho right? 
 MSmits: you make yourself lose whenever you know it's me
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: then someone else would pose as me and do the same moves
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I guess spoofing isn't so much suited to CG games
 MSmits: see i know what that word is because i am in an internet security class
 struct: if (MSmit s) winratio = -winratio
 Astrobytes: hehehe how long you have left on it?
 MSmits: 4 more homeworks
 MSmits: I think they delayed this weeks' homework because of corona
 Astrobytes: I like your measurement scale
 MSmits: yes, so  1 month&#160;:)
 MSmits: after that I will start an artificial intelligence class
 Astrobytes: Yeah, loads of people I know have been delayed at least a week, most a month
 MSmits: I was supposed to do media and user interaction
 MSmits: but that got cancelled
 MSmits: I;m so sad that i get to do AI instead ot hat
 MSmits: sooooo sad
 Astrobytes: HCI is always good tho
 MSmits: yes, but... AI
 Astrobytes: Obviously AI too&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's like free study credits to me. But still worth it, because it increases my motivation level 
 MSmits: internet security is so boring to me
 MSmits: It's important... but boring
 MSmits: interesting, and also.... boring
 Astrobytes: lol, I can understand that
 MSmits: btw, for oware I am now using a pure sinusoid for kroo param
 MSmits: period 11 because you seed 11 spots before you repeat
 MSmits: and it goes both negative and positive, so on average the bonus is 0
 MSmits: i fit the amplitude and I have a power param to make the sine more spiky if necessary (it's currently at 1 though)
 MSmits: i had a growing sine before, giving more bonus for larger seed counts, but I stopped that. i figured I already have a bonus for seedcount, so why pollute the sine with it
 Astrobytes: Clever. 
 Astrobytes: I like that
 MSmits: i turn it into a lookup array
 MSmits: so i dont have to calc the thing during eval, just a small kroo[]
 Astrobytes: Yeah I figured as much
 Astrobytes: Would be pretty expensive doing that everytime
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/hKXubEC">https://imgur.com/a/hKXubEC</a>
 MSmits: i had fixed bonuses first, 30+ params, one for every seedcount + pit combo
 MSmits: but then turned that into a sine
 struct: what do you use to make those graphs
 MSmits: orange line was what i used when i first beat the nns
 MSmits: just excel struct
 Astrobytes: You should do a small paper on this
 Astrobytes: Be better than half the other ones out there tbh
 MSmits: for oware, yeah I guess so
 MSmits: I wouldnt even mind giving stuff away, but I worry ruining the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: No need to give anything away directly
 MSmits: yeah it's a tough balance
 Astrobytes: Or indirectly. Just your findings
 MSmits: I also think my bitboard functions are really interesting
 MSmits: the seeding + capturing
 MSmits: I could double someone's simcount by sharing that
 Astrobytes: Implementation as exercise to the reader
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: you know, I really want to just pick 1 game and do a bitboard tutorial at some point
 MSmits: yavalath is too complex, uttt too messy
 struct: Also on something that is not hex
 MSmits: checkers and oware are pretty well suited fo rit
 struct: also breakthghrough
 MSmits: bandas too
 struct: or I can bring Orima
 MSmits: i didnt do breakthrough yet
 MSmits: a good bitboard tutorial shouldnt just cover adding and removing moves
 MSmits: it should also have some pdep / pext usage
 Astrobytes: Fair points
 Zenoscave: PCR Gold!!!!
 MSmits: grats Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: no sim yet either
 Astrobytes: grats Zeno
 Zenoscave: thx thx
 MSmits: sim is where the pain begins&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: That's why I avoided it
 MSmits: think about csb, only with pods pooping out other pods
 Zenoscave: I hate that idea
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i mean
 Zenoscave: It scares me
 MSmits: think about csb, only with pods giving birth to other pods
 MSmits: that better?
 Astrobytes: No.
 Zenoscave: not at all
 MSmits: ah well I tried
 Astrobytes: Worse I think.
 Zenoscave: Thanks for the effort
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: pcr is much more fun to look at though
 MSmits: like onitama is much more fun to look at than checkers
 MSmits: time to get going i think, it's late&#160;:)
 MSmits: gn guys
 struct: gn MSmits
 Zenoscave: gn
 GuYou:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: gn man take care

 MostComplicatedUsername: "I don't speak dog eater"
 MostComplicatedUsername: What???
 Sporko: for a first impression to that site it's a bad rep for the userbase
 MostComplicatedUsername: Not a first impression
 HereticalChildVanDerSwag_75a1: shut up you jew

 HereticalChildVanDerSwag_75a1: oh 
 HereticalChildVanDerSwag_75a1: i apologize for my mischarecterisation

 MostComplicatedUsername: mischaractarization
 MostComplicatedUsername: mischaractarisation
 MostComplicatedUsername: One of those two ^]

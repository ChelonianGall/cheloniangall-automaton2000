 JCProgrammer: what's going on y'all
 Wontonimo: i'm making a cave generator 
 Wontonimo: what are you up to?
 JCProgrammer: just clashin'
 JCProgrammer: continuously refreshing my phd applications 
 JCProgrammer: in other words, unhealthily obsessing
 Aaronnotsharon: what does it mean when the console outputs a stream of question marks? does that mean that the value is NULL?
 derjack: or bad encoding?
 derjack: so, a bird is a word? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you have a few things you can improve your coding skills
 aertify: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i'll give that a shot
 1mpossible_c: sometimes the clashes are so easy. but most of the time, they are very hard
 Hackan: siuuuu
 1mpossible_c: kes 
 Hirocco: where I can check the difficulty of clash problem&#160;? 
 Alshock: what do you mean by that?
 Alshock: clashes are not available as puzzles so they are not ranked from easy to very hard (though they'd all be ranked easy)
 1mpossible_c: cock

 1mpossible_c: I call these my suicide attempts
 Hirocco: lol chill 
 1mpossible_c: sorry haha
 5DN1L: hope you can practise and improve your coding here instead of typing that c-word you typed for no reason
 1mpossible_c: what's so wrong with roosters?
 5DN1L: Yeah yeah are roosters or whatever you meant remotely related to coding?
 5DN1L: Do you shout out that word in a public area for no reason too?
 5DN1L: Please stick to coding-related topics and mind your language in this chatroom

 aroncrime: hmm
 aroncrime: any have any clue how to make a string a range
 Quidome: python?
 aroncrime: ye python
 Quidome: What do you want to do?
 aroncrime: basically i wanna input a base 10 number and output that as a 7 segment thing
 aroncrime: i can probably do it but i dont know how to do a line break
 Quidome: Can you give an example input-output to work with
 aroncrime: input 123 output     _  _ 
 aroncrime:     _  _ 
 aroncrime:      _   _ 
 Quidome: Aha i see,
 5DN1L: line break is "\n"
 aroncrime: o
 Astrobytes: or just print(something) 
 Astrobytes: ^ automatically adds a \n
 5DN1L: print() by itself also gives a line break
 Pheytun: Hello how can i debug using python? this is for checking for test inputs
 5DN1L: your default code tells u how
 5DN1L: the* default
 Quidome: s = '123'for c in s:
 Quidome: a string IS a range you can just loop over it&#160;:)
 aroncrime: ohhhhhh

 BadBurger: starting with kotlin after i have decently learned js, i was supriced how fast js (loop with =+1) to python, now im scratching my head how much faster kotlin is to js,
 BlaiseEbuth: :speak_no_evil:
 BadBurger: i understand its compiling it, but its instant, should have learned that long ago since its a easy language
 Jingyi: If I want to learn python better , what can I do?
 derjack: i dont know if they fixed it, but kotlin compiling could timeout sometimes
 BlaiseEbuth: It timeout because it's too fast for the server...
 derjack: wait till he find out c++ is much faster than kotlin
 derjack: Jingyi do you know the basics?
 derjack: you can start with easy puzzles. then when you solve them you can see others' solutions
 Quidome: if you are really just starting exercism.org is a good place to start
 BadBurger: i know it is :D but i gave c++ a shot 4-5years ago, and i didnt have the energy to learn it, but i learned js by playing bitnode, its quite similiar to python, and kotlin is quite similiar to js, so its easy for me to go there.
 Jingyi: ya, thank you for your help!
 struct: BadBurger what do you mean by =+1
 BlaiseEbuth: I suppose he measures the time needed by a for loop with a step of 1 on a given iteration count... :thinking:
 BadBurger: well this for example struct
 BadBurger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e882a46-b095-4795-90d0-68851cbdd8ca">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2e882a46-b095-4795-90d0-68851cbdd8ca</a>
 struct: well that should be instant in most languages
 struct: compiler will optimize that easily
 BadBurger: that same thing in python takes 3years, 5sec in js and 0.2 in kotlin without timing only the function
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah...
 struct: and 0.0 seconds in c++
 BadBurger: well its 0.2 seconds, for 1000 loops or 100000000 loops. init takes the 0.2
 BlaiseEbuth: Probably 0.0 in kotlin too, but doesn't mean kotlin is as fast as C++
 BadBurger: but kotlin is so close to js wich i have a grasp now on, so its easy for me to go there, but c++ i dont have the energy to learn new foundation.
 derjack: compiler may be clever enough to just calculate it and not increment by 1
 struct: mov     eax, 10000000ret
 struct: this is in c++ 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5ebc203-38e2-4dd3-8622-44666316d8d0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a5ebc203-38e2-4dd3-8622-44666316d8d0</a>
 struct: basicly it will return 1000000
 struct: it doesnt need loops to find out what the value is
 BadBurger: i know c++ is fast, im not omparing it to c++ im comparing to js, since its pretty much if you know js you know kotlin after 2h. well almost
 struct: depends on the compiler
 struct: and if its release or debug
 struct: im sure js can optimize this aswell
 derjack: if you know js you have brain damage. consult a doctor please
 BlaiseEbuth: +1
 BadBurger: well, i learned js from playing bitnode, you have to program in js to play it. i enjoyed it.
 BadBurger: its free on steam
 derjack: so its a gamer
 derjack: all google found is some bitcoin stuff
 BadBurger: gets old after couple days when you program a crawler and "hacking" software that pretty much does everything 
 BadBurger: sry, its bitburner and not bitnode
 Quidome: did anyone do search race?
 struct: yes
 Quidome: I am not sure how the scoring goes
 struct: isnt it the number of turns?
 struct: lower = better?
 Quidome: fastest time what does that mean
 Quidome: yes maybe
 derjack: number of frames, the lower the better
 Quidome: frame = turn?
 struct: ye
 derjack: eeyup
 Quidome: ok, that was easy :P
 Quidome: thnxs
 derjack: quite pleseant optim
 derjack: experimented with neuroevolution but the cars kept driving in circles
 BadBurger: im having trouble googling what im looking for in kotlin, does it not have this? (object in js, or array in python)
 Quidome: yeah, interesting, was looking at it from a math perspective but now looking at reinforcement learning
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/for-loop">https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/for-loop</a>
 derjack: i used GA for it
 derjack: my main is 6th
 Quidome: nice!
 BadBurger: obj = {a:1, b:5} when i call obj[a] it returns 1, do i need to do a function for this?
 BadBurger: kotlin
 derjack: thats called dictionary
 derjack: or hashmap
 BadBurger: thx, il google with that for kotlin
 BadBurger: yep, found it thx
 Quidome: What do you mean with "my main is 6th"
 derjack: im jacek
 derjack: *gasp*
 Quidome: aha aliassing
 Quidome: why do you use two accounts?
 derjack: to test algos without disrubting my leaderboard
 Quidome: aha, ok, nice to knwo
 Quidome: 6th with GA I am impressed 
 KrazyPanda: hi
 KrazyPanda: :grin:
 derjack: ohai
 therealbeef: i tried a math approach for search race. got to 19th but since then it has dropped a bit. it's not easy since it's QCQP problem
 ninjadip: /me
 Quidome: QCQP?
 ninjadip: yeah, you know me
 ninjadip: i'm down with OOP
 therealbeef: quadratic constraints quadratic programming
 OmarZaweayhAlyamaa: why no one online&#160;! &gt;where is the pliiiirs
 ninjadip: i don't have any pliers but i'm here
 OmarZaweayhAlyamaa: 0 plir join moi clash
 OmarZaweayhAlyamaa:&#160;!
 ninjadip: got brain f*#$ up, got to get the output under 6.5k it says for extra credit
 ninjadip: oi oi
 therealbeef: but gradient descent works
 Uljahn: solving offline?
 derjack: gradient descent? where
 Quidome: search race i suppose
 ninjadip: search critical race
 therealbeef: yes
 ninjadip: never heard about CRT until a game mentioned it in the dialogue
 ninjadip: that disco elysium is one trippy game
 therealbeef: you can write out the objective function and the constraints (passing by checkpoints) and then find the partial derivatives of all parameters (thrust and angle per turn)
 ninjadip: wow
 ninjadip: i just start steering to the next checkpoint when i'm almost at my current checkpoint
 derjack: so, using math :unamused:
 ninjadip: makes a nice swing through the checkpoints
 ninjadip: do it my way, very little math, just code really
 derjack: neuroevolution attempt <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/606145628">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/606145628</a>
 ninjadip: if distance to checkpoint&lt;X &amp;&amp; velocity &gt; X2 then steer to checkpoint +1
 ninjadip: you don't want to prematurely steer to the next checkpoint if your momentum won't carry you enough to pass your current checkpoint
 ninjadip: that added with drift correction steering is beast. zero brakes
 jacek: and GA approach <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/606146169">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/606146169</a>
 struct: which  inputs did you use for NN?
 derjack: vx, vy, sin(angle), cos(angle), nextCPx, nextCPy, nextCP2x-nextCPx, nextCP2y-nextCPy; normalized accordingly
 derjack: and 2 outputs: thrust and angle
 derjack: not the typical 6 actions and choose one
 Uljahn: therealbeef: very interesting, do you find the partial derivatives by hand or using some math package?
 therealbeef: by hand
 Uljahn: for discrete functions?
 therealbeef: i think so yes
 Uljahn: do you think the same approach can be used in mars lander?
 therealbeef: i think i did some hack for when you pass through a checkpoint but neither start nor end position of a turn lies within the checkpoint
 therealbeef: i tried similar approach for mars lander i think, but then gave up or changed approach for some reason (was a year ago)
 Rebollo: Guys how are you doing?

 Rebollo: here in the plat?
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/search">https://www.codingame.com/forum/search</a>
 Rebollo: thank you
 Rebollo: Any tip about the architecture? Is is a good ideia to create a linked list, tree or something like that?
 5DN1L: I don't have a tip about what you mention. The puzzle's front page mentions "Backtracking" and "Recursion"
 Nahro: Yo pier
 Rebollo: I am trying to keep track of the possible paths using a string chain
 Rebollo: But it seems that is not a good ideia
 Rebollo: also when I try to use recursion
 Rebollo: IT seems that thses data  go wild
 Rebollo: mutiple versions
 Rebollo: at the same time
 Rebollo: I kind of getting crazy
 struct: if you wanna go full crazy try breakthrough
 Rebollo: What would be the best way to control parameters using recursing without messing up the information the control everything??
 Rebollo: breakthrough what is it?

 Rebollo: nice
 struct: I use MCTS
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: sup
 struct: monte carlo tree search
 Rebollo: humm
 Rebollo: extreme complex?
 struct: not really
 Rebollo: you can have N number of child per node? like no limit?
 struct: yes
 struct: usually its the number of moves
 Rebollo: How do you control that? list of child?
 struct: on bt should be 16*3
 Rebollo: vector?
 struct: i initialize an array at the start of the game with 40'000'000 nodes
 struct: and then my Node struct has number of children and first child index
 struct: All childrens will be next to each other
 Rebollo: which language?
 struct: c++
 Rebollo: child are next with each other
 Rebollo: and control the parent obviouly
 struct: When I expand the parent
 struct: I set the next node available as the first children index
 struct: wait the reverse
 struct: the first children index is the next node available
 struct: I keep track of all the nodes I used so far
 Rebollo: And you never swap anything right? just go forwar dand backwears in a static list?
 struct: yeah I dont swap anything

 linjoehan: I drawed the diagram in the top right corner, now it opens a whole field of math to solve this problem
 linjoehan: haha also there's a pun in there if you a real nerd
 struct: Rebollo you dont need to learn it, its more so I can allocate more nodes and wont run out of memory
 struct: its only really usefull on some multiplayers
 Rebollo: how you control the parent?
 Rebollo: I havent seen it
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: "comeout? train go boom"
 struct: I add the parent to an  array everytime I visit it
 struct: just so I can use it on backpropagate
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: "No Man Fights Alone. In the war that changed the world, no one fought alone."
 Rebollo: use recursion?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: this is what it's like getting helped in coding
 struct: no, I use a for loop
 Rebollo: humm
 Rebollo: when you intialize the "tree" it is empty? is create every possibility? when to stop?
 struct: so how mcts is like this
 struct: tree is empty at the start
 struct: you then select the best node using UCB
 struct: wait the tree has the root only*
 struct: since you dont have any more nodes yet the selected node would be the root
 struct: then you expand the root with all the next moves
 struct: so you will have N new nodes expanded and the selected node will have N children
 struct: after that you select one node at random and do a rollout
 struct: play a game with "random" moves until the game is over
 jacek: bt eh
 struct: then you backpropagate that result up to the root
 struct: just wait jacek i will finish learning NNs this time
 struct: you do the following steps until you run out of time, expand select rollout backpropagte
 struct: select, expand*
 BadBurger: im confused, im trying to add int from mapOf in kotlin, but im getting compile error:*inferred type is Int? but Int was expected
 Rebollo: nice
 BadBurger: when im trying to add that value to my int
 BadBurger: cant use this either: val score: Int = dictionary[s.toString()]
 struct: sry mate I have no idea how kotlin works
 jacek: whats s
 jacek: BadBurger either val score: Int? = dictionary[s.toString()]
 jacek: or val score: Int = dictionary[s.toString()]!!
 jacek: because dictionary may not have the value, it will return null
 BadBurger: ok, i will try this
 BadBurger: thx mate, it compiled. have no idea whats the difference with int? and int
 jacek: int? means its nullable. kotlin is about null safety unlike java
 BadBurger: okay, thx

 Rebollo: How A i supose to initlize withoout giving length?
 struct: you dont need to with vectors
 jacek: this is dynamic

 Rebollo: here
 BadBurger: kinda stupid that on practice, it dont compile it and use it on all testcases, but compiles it again for every test case..
 Rebollo: objects newObject = objects(matrix[i][j]);
 struct: he is most likely trying to push a normal var into * vec
 Astrobytes: looks that way
 Rebollo: yes you are right
 struct: push_back(new(newObject))
 struct: i think my code is wrong
 struct: new objects(newObject)
 Rebollo: ok but I got the concept

 linjoehan: is your solution in python?
 BadBurger: no, kotlin
 BadBurger: i just wrote, i started learning kotlin today
 linjoehan: Ah nice.
 5DN1L: no, please don't post your solution here BadBurger
 linjoehan: I learned python about 3 monts ago. I totally hate it
 BadBurger: yeah, 5DN1L i figured that might be the case.
 BadBurger: i love python, but im starting to really like kotlin, i dont know why i enjoy thats its retarded in that it so sensitive and that you cant even change a string. but i enjoy it.
 5DN1L: Nice
 5DN1L: What's your plan? Continue to learn more kotlin?
 BadBurger: yeah, after its compiled, its fast, and kotlin seems so natural for me to learn unlike C, and when i have the hang of it, i can start looking at making some personalised apps on android such as reporting app for work. but thats later.
 jacek: if you solved a puzzle, your solution is shared (by default)
 Husoski: Really?  I thought you had to enable auto-sharing?
 jacek: maybe they changed recently
 BadBurger: no its not shared, you need to activate the function. 
 jacek: oh
 BadBurger: it asks if you want to publish all future solution after first 100% when you post your first solution
 jacek: people normally come to kotlin from java
 BadBurger: yeah i figured, but i did play bitburner on steam, and i had to learn js from the game to play it, played it couple days and got familiar with this kind of syntax so it did help a f load. so saying i started kotlin today from python background might be little misleading, but not false.
 struct: java made me learn c++
 struct: thanks java
 BadBurger: it ignited my love of coding again, ive had a couple years break from coding. 
 jacek: there was colobot game. you had to write c(?) like scripts to make the robots do stuff
 Kattekongen: Is there a way to keep working on a clash of code minigame even after the timer has run out?
 jacek: not officially. if you remember the contents you can try to search it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 BadBurger: but kotlin has so many ways of doing the same thing its insane. if you google loop functions, you get several ways, feels like theres multiple builtin functions to do the same thing. i pick the easyest, but i know that most often the easyest can be alot slower.
 Rebollo: Oh my god, how can I walk trough this guys?
 Rebollo: objectsNode* rootNode = ballNodes[4];
 Rebollo: tempNode = tempNode-&gt;leftChild;
 Rebollo: But it happen to be circular..
 jacek: depends whats leftChild
 struct: what do you mean by circular?
 Rebollo: this row for sample
 Rebollo: .    .    .    .    .    .    .  B_4_F
 Rebollo: keeps showing
 Rebollo: B_4_F
 Rebollo: .
 Rebollo: B4_F
 Rebollo: .
 Rebollo:  instead og going all the way to the left
 Wontonimo: I've made my first world chat bot!
 Wontonimo: if you say "wontonimo tell me about cats" it will respond
 Wontonimo:&#160;:)
 5DN1L: :D
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wontonimo tell me about cats
 wontonimo: eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers I dont know about cats
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: XD
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's all it does
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: hm
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i got my virus done
 BadBurger: i tought it dissed first until i actually read the full name :D
 5DN1L: More to come, right? Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: maybe&#160;;)
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: perhaps an alt account that isn't my name
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: time to burn the world
 Wontonimo: no
 BadBurger: everyone will start spamming you with that line, and suddenly you instareply to all and get muted :D
 5DN1L: yeah it should be something related to coding, not cats
 Wontonimo: you have high expectations of me
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wontonimo tell me about cats
 wontonimo: eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers I dont know about cats
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wontonimo tell me about cats
 wontonimo: eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers I dont know about cats
 BadBurger: wontonimo tell me about cats
 wontonimo: BadBurger I dont know about cats
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wontonimo tell me about cats
 wontonimo: eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers I dont know about cats
 Wontonimo: no more please
 BadBurger: wontonimo tell me about cats
 wontonimo: BadBurger I dont know about cats
 Wontonimo: ikay, i'm turning it off
 Wontonimo: off
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wontionimo tell me about cats
 BadBurger: maybe code a reply intervall?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: aw
 Wontonimo: no more please
 5DN1L: Maybe Automaton2000 will pick up that line
 Automaton2000: i think he wanted to do a lot with any kind of search
 Wontonimo: HA!
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: Death solves all problems – no man, no problem.
 jacek: cats are discussed on Caturdays
 Wontonimo: Automaton2000 tell me about cats
 Automaton2000: see what i mean is, if you have more to do with vertices that are duplicated for uv purposes
 jacek: uv eh Automaton2000
 BadBurger: it was fast replys, is your code working even tho you dont have the browser active and visible?
 Automaton2000: i know that, i just don't understand why it works
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: Five second fuses only last three seconds
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background, the countless minor scenes and interiors of the secession war; and it is best they should not. The real war will never get in the books
 5DN1L: eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers keep that long speech to yourself
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: why
 5DN1L: it doesn't belong here
 5DN1L: please, ok?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers:&#160;;-;
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: fine...........
 5DN1L: thanks
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: i have a even wayyyyyyyy longer one
 5DN1L: don't put any of them here
 5DN1L: Wontonimo, as BadBurger was asking: it was fast replys, is your code working even tho you dont have the browser active and visible?
 Husoski: "wontonimo tell me about cats" 
 jacek: i see wala still tweaking his eval
 wala: hi, yes but with no real results
 jacek: oh
 Rebollo: Guys I am sorry
 Rebollo: I am printing my hole code
 Rebollo: Could you pleaswe help me undersatand
 Rebollo: why I cant navigate trought the node]in the

 Wontonimo: 5DN1L and BadBurger , it is running as a console script using nodejs
 Wontonimo: no browser needed
 5DN1L: interesting
 Wontonimo: i set it to replay within 500ms so that it would make a good demo.  a more reasonable delay would be good
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 replies fast too
 Automaton2000: did you try to do it now
 5DN1L: Not right now though
 5DN1L: Sometimes it does
 struct: wala its impossible to tweak eval
 Wontonimo: i looked at that code.  It uses a queue and pops the next phrase it will say once every couple seconds.  So it really depends when in the cycle it generates the message
 5DN1L: ah i see
 struct: wala do you use mcts or minmax?
 BadBurger: jacek you are a kotlin guru, im supriced i cannot add a list, inside a list as i can do in js and python. dont seem to find anything in google. im trying to make a grid list, with row, col
 BadBurger: any tips?
 struct: Rebollo which puzzle is it?
 Rebollo: Winamax Sponsored Contest
 struct: im getting seg fault
 Rebollo: I am missing some concepts
 Rebollo: I think the root cause of the problem is in the
 Rebollo: initMatrixPointers
 Rebollo: I think I am not linking nothing to anything
 Rebollo: I think I am
 jacek: BadBurger you mean List&lt;List&lt;xxx&gt;&gt;?
 Rebollo: and think I am *
 BadBurger: jacek yes
 BadBurger: so i can call it list[2][3] for row2 col 3
 Rebollo: is my code horrible?
 jacek: List is immutable. you want MutableList if you want to change it. and mutableListOf
 struct: matrix = vector&lt;vector&lt;objects &gt;&gt;(h);for (int i = 0; i &lt; h; i++)
 struct: this is wrong
 Wontonimo: discuss feature requests for a possible new CG chat bot #botfeatures
 struct: one of them should be a w right?
 struct: I guess the 2nd one?
 Rebollo: w?
 struct: height width
 struct: the board isnt always a square is it?
 Rebollo: they got the same size
 Rebollo: its square
 BadBurger: jacek, yeah i know i need mutable list, but if a=mutablelist with items, how do i add that list to list b?
 struct: 2 11H
 struct: This is not a square
 struct: sorry
 jacek: b.add(a)&#160;?
 Rebollo: not square?
 Rebollo: 2x2?
 struct: its 2x1?
 Sllama: bad
 struct: 2 = width 1 = height
 struct: 1H
 struct: at least for Test 1
 Rebollo: Your program must output a grid of equal width and height, containing arrows indicating how the balls must be hit.
 ElGodYosh: Hi, i'm trying to use an ArrayList in Java on the online editor of condingame, but am unable to find how to import corresponding package :x 
 Rebollo: Each character of the string represents one column
 struct: statement is poorly worded
 struct: the height must not be equal to width
 wala: Hi struct
 struct: but it must be equal to the height they gave you
 struct: hi wala
 wala: I'm using minimax
 jacek: ElGodYosh its already imported as java.util.*
 ElGodYosh: cheers mate
 wala: I've tride MCTS but with bad results
 BadBurger: hmm, i can add a list to a list with val y_c = mutableListOf(x_c), but if i create a new empty mutable list, &lt;List&gt; does not work so i cant add to it. didnt find declare empty list for List on google
 struct: MCTS with EPT?
 wala: what's ept
 struct: early playout termination
 struct: do normal eval after N plays of rollout
 struct: but minimax seems to be doing well for you
 struct: I dont think many people used mcts here
 wala: no i did that for oware
 struct: i meant on bt sorr
 struct: sorry*
 wala: i did not try it on breakthrough
 struct: its probably not worth it
 jacek: bt has quite big branching factor. you'd need something smart for the selection as well
 struct: branch moves?
 jacek: even if you have smart rollouts, how do you select children, especially unvisitied ones?
 wala: My minimax evaluation does a lot of computations. But i still have ideas so i try them. 
 jacek: is it bitboard?
 wala: Yes
 struct: maybe I should try my eval on minimax
 struct: maybe it would work
 jacek: do you have cheap win/loss checking 3 or 4 plies before it actually happens?
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: war never changes
 wala: I check if some pawns can surely win
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7f4e94bc-2de2-428d-84c2-fefe90600909">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7f4e94bc-2de2-428d-84c2-fefe90600909</a>
 wala: Now i'm trying to keep my attacking pawns together
 struct: This checks if player won
 struct: from 6th row
 struct: for any combo possible
 struct: only works if its the current player turn
 Rebollo: O I got the problem
 Rebollo: were doing everythingwrong acctually
 wala: I've something like this working for both players.
 struct: basicly the idea is if you are attacking a cell more times than its protected than you won
 wala: I just check if there's a "free way"
 wala: But thanks for your code. I'll try to understand it.
 struct: np, I wrote that code but ended up never using it
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: unnc
 jacek: when i used classic way, i gave penalty to attacked not protected pawn (if not my turn)
 wala: i've got something like that too but it needs to be perfected
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 hyphz: Ok wtf is with the certification tests saying you're better than 99% of people if you hit all the use cases
 hyphz: Like, a good second year could do these, they are good but they sure as hell are not better than 99% of professional programmers 
 Wontonimo: :unamused:  yeah, CG knows.  it's under review
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wontonimo tell me about cats
 Wontonimo: no
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: why not

 Svat623: hi there. is it possible to see how much and which of my solutions was  published&#160;???
 Svat623: can anybody help with this important question?
 EzS-NoVa: yes
 Rebollo: Now I am in the right track
 Rebollo: .00 _ .10 _ .20 _ .30 _ .40 _ .50 _ .60 _ B70 _ .60 _ .50 _ .40 _ .30 _ .20 _ .10 _ .00
 Rebollo: uhulll
 Rebollo: Guys, question:
 Rebollo: If, in C++, I pass a pointer as a parameter in a function
 Rebollo: Every change int it wiil be replicate to my original object
 Rebollo: or I have to return it and assign it agian
 Rebollo:&#160;?
 Svat623: :zzz:
 Rebollo: int* i = 0
 Astrobytes: if you pass it like func(Object* ptr) it will change it, if you pass as func(const Object* ptr) it will not.
 Astrobytes: *can not
 Rebollo: nicee thanyou
 Rebollo: I when to use &amp;?
 Rebollo: and*
 Astrobytes: complex topic but in general prefer references over pointers unless you really, really need the pointer
 Astrobytes: I would advise reading up on some C++ topics
 Rebollo: sure
 Rebollo: thank you again
 Astrobytes: you're welcome&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: oh Rebollo, did you mean &amp; in terms of pointers?
 Rebollo: yes
 Rebollo: some time IDE suggests adding these guys
 Astrobytes: Ah, OK, apologies. &amp; is also for references e.g. Object&amp; objRef
 Rebollo: and I got confused
 Astrobytes: &amp; in the context of pointers is the address-of operator
 Astrobytes: Object* ptr = &amp;objToGetMemoryAddressOf;
 Astrobytes: Again, it's worth reading up on this and practising a lot, it can be confusing at first.
 Rebollo: I know, I use to do that a lot but sometime I got even more confused
 Astrobytes: As long as you know how memory works in a computer you can get your head around pointers and memory management.
 Rebollo: I dont really know ..I have an idea but..
 Rebollo: like
 Rebollo: assignAllThePointers(lastNode, LEFT);
 Rebollo: lastNode is a pointer
 Rebollo: is this going to change this guy out the function
 Astrobytes: yep
 Rebollo: I am doing something wrong then
 Astrobytes: UNLESS your function definition is assignAllThePointers(const Node* lastNode, Direction direction)
 Rebollo: void assignAllThePointers(objectsNode* o ,Direction d)
 Astrobytes: that seems fine then.
 Rebollo: Even if I got 2 levels deep?
 Rebollo: There is another function inside this one
 Rebollo: which actually changes the value
 Rebollo: Iside&#160;:
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6fb916e0-476e-4514-b67c-80f09972bfb1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6fb916e0-476e-4514-b67c-80f09972bfb1</a>
 Astrobytes: You're assigning this object to an object that's inside the object your assigning to?
 Astrobytes: What are you trying to do exactly? It seems like you're overcomplicating things here
 Rebollo: I got a function that is suposse to assign the references (pointers) but inside of it I have another function which assigns, but also check if the left and right between the "constraints" which are the matrix width and height

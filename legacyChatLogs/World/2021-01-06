 5rbsh518: Hi
 SoulNinja: damn chat in coc
 Joekung: :slight_smile:
 jiligualabajibaji: ohhhh
 Aya_Noaman: join shortm mode clash from #clash
 jacek: good morning
 Major-Thrust: kek bois
 SwagColoredKitteh: jacek hi hi
 eulerscheZahl: 2 days in a row, something is off SwagColoredKitteh
 SwagColoredKitteh: :D
 SwagColoredKitteh: the awesome power of coffee is keeping me awake
 jacek: oh my
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: bring us some more coffee
 Automaton2000: and if they are at the top of my head
 Stilgart: he even does the show :D
 SwagColoredKitteh: Automaton2000 is a qt
 Automaton2000: or you can be the difference between the two
 SwagColoredKitteh: yes yes
 eulerscheZahl: you were gone for so long, do you even know the 2 Automatons, SwagColoredKitteh?
 SwagColoredKitteh: wait, there are two?
 eulerscheZahl: Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: good night
 Automaton2000: my code is a mess
 SwagColoredKitteh: what's the difference?
 eulerscheZahl: i hate the NN one
 eulerscheZahl: neural network
 SwagColoredKitteh: and the other markov chain?
 eulerscheZahl: 2000 is a markov chain
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 SwagColoredKitteh: markov chain ones are more fun
 SwagColoredKitteh: Automaton2000 hello you're fun
 Automaton2000: there could be a nice feature
 SwagColoredKitteh: when i did a markov chain thing i made it record the triplets in both directions and select a seed word, which is the least frequent word from the message it's replying to
 SwagColoredKitteh: and then build from both directions
 SwagColoredKitteh: always made it seem like it was responding in some way
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 SwagColoredKitteh: kind of like primitive keyword detection
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, i get the idea
 SwagColoredKitteh: also generating a bunch of candidates and checking similarity with the message it's responding to, making sure it's similar but not too similar
 PandaKing: like, i came in here knowing nothing will i learn atleast something here?
 SwagColoredKitteh: not sure if that was a good idea
 PandaKing: like i know the basics, but 
 SwagColoredKitteh: PandaKing the easy puzzles are a good starting point if you already know how to program
 eulerscheZahl: if you are able to solve the easy puzzles, then CG can be a great website to improve
 PandaKing: ok thanks kitteh
 SwagColoredKitteh: you can always try and see if it works out
 SwagColoredKitteh: happy to help
 eulerscheZahl: if those are really hard already, maybe watch some youtube tutorials before
 PandaKing: ok, thanks guys
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: is the NN one pinging you that much&#160;?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes 3 messages in a row even
 Stilgart: AutomatonNN: do less euler and more turtle, please&#160;!
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same code?
 Stilgart: wow...
 Stilgart: NN does not ping so much on #fr
 eulerscheZahl: other training set
 Stilgart: and 2000 is far more aggressive
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i could analyze the chatlogs from dbdr
 Stilgart: discussion are more serious here... but I do not see why NN would say your nickname that much
 eulerscheZahl: i still believe something went wrong in training
 eulerscheZahl: even if Agade says no
 BlaiseEbuth: On fr NN create fake links now...
 eulerscheZahl: expired pastebins?
 Stilgart: nope, he is trolling CG by creating fake expired pastebins :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope. Totaly created cg-like links
 BlaiseEbuth: Sort of impressive since he works char by char...
 Stilgart: to be honnest, I really doubt that he is really working char by char
 BlaiseEbuth: They lie to us&#160;! :scream:
 Stilgart: the recursive part in its NN might in fact imply that it is working on words
 Stilgart: except when reaching its size limit, NN almost always provides correct words
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: ➜  Chat:World grep "AutomatonNN: " * | wc -l 472➜  Chat:World grep "AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl" * | wc -l64
 AutomatonNN: check the problem
 eulerscheZahl: so 13% of his messages are about me
 BlaiseEbuth: The ransom of glory...
 Stilgart: or NN did learn that the english word for contest is eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb428735-2eae-41f1-a2d6-6b0bc081d63b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb428735-2eae-41f1-a2d6-6b0bc081d63b</a>
 eulerscheZahl: pastebin truncated
 eulerscheZahl: but often asking me for a way
 jacek: the way of euler
 Stilgart: sounds like "eZ is there a way" here is our "contest de contest" on #fr
 BlaiseEbuth: :D
 Stilgart: " AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to destroy a lot of puzzles and forget about it" 
 AutomatonNN: what is the most interesting to to do it
 Stilgart: I really love this one :D
 BlaiseEbuth: Hikigaeru-do
 Stilgart: more seriously, I am right when I think that there are not so many words starting with e in english&#160;?
 Stilgart: (which makes eZ an logical start when picking e as the first letter)
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure how this works. random next letter or random full word
 eulerscheZahl: for full words it seems unlikely to ping me that often
 <b>**SPDene checks an old-fashioned (actual book) dictionary...</b></p><p><img src="/a/29054906001010" /> Stilgart: NN produces its answer char by char
 SPDene: 41 pages of Es in a 1255-page dictionary ... so around 3.3%
 Stilgart: what is inside its neural networks is a mystery for me
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, dictionaries
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: I'm sorry it's in french and I couldn't find the english translation, but here's what you should answer to AutomatonNN next time&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuIkPfklM5Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuIkPfklM5Y</a>

 jacek: mhm
 jacek: i see the war is resumed in othello
 MSmits: yep
 darkhorse64: I have found a way to increase the performance of my C4 engine. I have  now 3.2M to 4.5 M light rollouts first turn (depending on the CPU).
 darkhorse64: MSmits: one loss for you, bad submit
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: is it stronger than my bot now?
 darkhorse64: I mean Othello, you are still wrecking me at C4
 MSmits: ohh ok
 darkhorse64: Yeah, no worries :grin:
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: yeah i never have a fully won submit on othello, people use random in their move selection, as they should
 MSmits: the war jacek is talking about is old john
 MSmits: he keeps counter booking me
 MSmits: like 30 plies deep or something&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: This submit looks dreadful. 2.5 lead at 50%
 MSmits: right :P
 darkhorse64: 4 points lead. Is that usual&#160;? I haven't look at Othello for a while
 darkhorse64: *looked*
 Minato_N: hi
 mesu7: hey
 jacek: generaly its about 4.5-6
 jacek: err 5
 jacek: he just books the top
 mesu7: my browser doesn't redirect me to the editor page when clash starts. i tried opera but it's the same
 jacek: hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm... How to put a link in a contribution statement&#160;? I don't find the right syntax...
 eulerscheZahl: SDK or classic contribution?
 BlaiseEbuth: classic
 eulerscheZahl: you don't. at least not as a clickable URL

 Nuwaisir: anyone?
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah. I thought the possibilities were the same...
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: nope, far away
 eulerscheZahl: no images either
 eulerscheZahl: make it an SDK contribution and kill the viewer via Javascript :P
 BlaiseEbuth: :expressionless:
 eulerscheZahl: it would work
 eulerscheZahl: when did you start with contributions? for the quest map?
 jacek: see? and now its not 4 points
 Minato_N: OMG
 Minato_N: THERES THIS DUDE WHO GOT 259 WPM
 Minato_N: 50 MINUTES AGO
 Minato_N: ON TYPERACER
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't scream
 SwagColoredKitteh: maybe using a chorded keyboard or sth
 SwagColoredKitteh: you can get really high wpm with those
 Kitkat260: gm everyone
 SwagColoredKitteh: hey o/
 Kitkat260: how r u today
 Minato_N:  HI
 Minato_N: good
 Minato_N: hbu'
 Kitkat260: tired but good
 Kitkat260: school
 Minato_N: I got class in 1 hr 330 mins&#160;:&lt;
 Minato_N: *30
 SwagColoredKitteh: tired but mostly fine
 SwagColoredKitteh: online classes sound awful
 Kitkat260: yep
 Minato_N: SCHOOL IS AWFUL
 Minato_N: no matter if it online or not
 Kitkat260: thank you!!!!!
 jacek: aww
 Minato_N: ig in like 4th grade school was noice
 BlaiseEbuth: eZ&#160;: I don't contribute a lot, but nothing to do with the questmap. Most of the item were automatically validated when it was released...
 SwagColoredKitteh: i haven't been to school in over a decade lmao
 SwagColoredKitteh: well, unless you count university
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty confident i could write some script for typeracer and top that score
 Kitkat260: Minato_N r u a boy or girl
 SwagColoredKitteh: eulerscheZahl :D
 Minato_N: im a boy lol
 Kitkat260: ok
 SwagColoredKitteh: nice conversation
 Kitkat260: how old r u guys
 SwagColoredKitteh: 27
 Minato_N: 10
 Kitkat260: nice
 SwagColoredKitteh: nice.
 BlaiseEbuth: 666
 eulerscheZahl: in what unit?
 SwagColoredKitteh: BlaiseEbuth i'm scared
 Kitkat260: why
 SwagColoredKitteh: eulerscheZahl teraflops
 Kitkat260: is someone that is 15 or 16
 Kitkat260: just asking
 Minato_N: nah
 Kitkat260: ok
 Minato_N: is anybody here in elementary/middle school xD
 Kitkat260: i'm in 9th so yea
 Astrobytes: Kitkat260: For the 2nd time: take your meaningless conversation elsewhere.
 Minato_N: Anyways
 Minato_N: what langs do yall use
 jacek: here, have a pun <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-5ec3824072edc__700.jpg">https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-5ec3824072edc__700.jpg</a>
 Astrobytes: jacek :D
 Greycooper: What is this channel supposed to be used for Astrobytes?
 SwagColoredKitteh: jacek xD
 SwagColoredKitteh: Greycooper bragging about bots
 Minato_N: jacek LOLOL
 SwagColoredKitteh: telling people to play csb, too, i guess?
 Astrobytes: Greycooper: chatting about the site usually, general conversation
 Greycooper: ah k, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: let me give you an example:
 jacek: or puzzles tips
 Kitkat260: how do you guys so good a coding
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle idea: you have a bunch of switches and light bulbs
 Minato_N: coding is noice
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know how they are wired
 Minato_N: and pretty ez
 Minato_N: imo
 Minato_N: if u know the fundamentals, u can be god at coding
 eulerscheZahl: and you have to flip switches to generate a certain pattern with the light bulbs
 eulerscheZahl: sounds interesting?
 SwagColoredKitteh: eulerscheZahl that sounds like a fun puzzle
 Kitkat260: I'm terrible at coding 
 Minato_N: u'll get better
 Minato_N: im terrible as well
 Minato_N: xD
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still thinking about the details. not to turn it into the next bulls and cows where you enumerate all possibilities and exclude one after another. but need something a little smarter
 Minato_N: anybody wanna clash
 Minato_N: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1532832968b5389bb9b2175679a6be1f11ad156">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1532832968b5389bb9b2175679a6be1f11ad156</a>
 eulerscheZahl: use #clash for those invites
 Astrobytes: Like a sort of crossflip variant?
 Minato_N: oh sry
 eulerscheZahl: yes, somewhat
 eulerscheZahl: but you can have series and parallel connections between switches
 Astrobytes: Right, gotcha
 eulerscheZahl: and initial state of switches is unknown, you toggle one at a time
 SwagColoredKitteh: eulerscheZahl and have hidden logic gates between switches and lightbulbs? :P
 Kitkat260: #clash
 eulerscheZahl: now it's getting overkill :D
 SwagColoredKitteh: :D
 Astrobytes: That would simply be cruel!
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, poor Stilgart :D
 Kokoz: Hello all, I need some help with Coders Strike Back
 Kitkat260: don't ask me
 eulerscheZahl: is it the BOOST command?
 Kokoz: um, I figured out BOOST, I have an issue with thrust
 DaNinja: Euler that sounds similar to the Electrician Apprentice puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: oh, haven't even tried that one.
 GriM: So i just spent about 8 hours doing the porcupine test
 GriM: MY GOD does it feel good to be done
 eulerscheZahl: but for that puzzle you know the wiring already and don't have to reverse it from given outputs
 Minato_N: Hi!
 Minato_N: Bruh
 Minato_N: i cant do the code jam that i have been working on for the past 4 days
 eulerscheZahl: and did you pass? are you a procupine?
 GriM: i am indeed
 GriM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/porcupine-fever">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/porcupine-fever</a>

 eulerscheZahl: did you click the first to harvest it?
 GriM: nevermind, didn't click it lmao
 Kitkat260: welcome GriM
 Minato_N: hi
 derp22: Is there a way to access local files or how do you save a trained AI?
 Kitkat260: hi derp22
 derp22: Hey
 Kitkat260: want to join clash of code
 Astrobytes: You need to scrape replay data if necessary, train offline and upload the weights
 derp22: I see
 derp22: Ty
 Astrobytes: np
 Kokoz: Guys, in coders strike back I made the ship slow down the bigger the angle to next sp is, but it only works when it is rotating to the right.. Any ideas?
 derp22: The angle is negative when you need to turn left
 derp22: So -90 means the checkpoint is directly to your left and 90 means it's directly to your right
 Kitkat260: The angle is positive when you need to turn right 
 Kitkat260: #clash
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to join that channel, write "/join clash". you don't have to flood it here over and over
 Kitkat260: sorry
 Astrobytes: And consider renaming yourself CaptainObvious
 Kitkat260: ok
 Kokoz: Well my formula is 100*(1 - (angle/90) and if the number is higher than 100, the speed is 100. If the number is lower than 0, the speed is *-1
 Kokoz: so it should work turning right and left
 derp22: Which league are you in
 Kokoz: Bronze
 BlaiseEbuth: With your formula if the angle is -90 you get a result of 200, so you speed up...
 derp22: Ok so if the angle is -90, then you get 1 - (-90/90) = 1 - (-1) = 2
 BlaiseEbuth: first \o/
 proogrmr: \o/
 derp22: You can use the abs() function to turn the negative to a positive
 derp22: Depending on your language I guess
 Kokoz: Python, and yes I am using abs(). So if the angle is -90 then the speed is 200, and I made an if that says if it is above 100 then it is 100
 derp22: Yeah so you're not slowing down when turning left
 Kokoz: ohh yea, so I need to tell it that when the angel is negative it should also use the formula
 SPDene: a negative angel? is that a demon? :P
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 BlaiseEbuth: :imp:
 Kokoz: oops :S
 junk007: 中国nb
 Kokoz: ok, I fixed it, now it slows down only when turning left xD
 zhoubou: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/gallery/HTisMpC">https://imgur.com/gallery/HTisMpC</a>
 zhoubou: How did you... "fix" it?
 Kokoz: lol 
 Kokoz: when angle is &lt; 0 the formula is 1+ instead of 1-
 zhoubou: abs() should work
 zhoubou: `100*(1 - (abs(angle)/90)`, no?
 Kokoz: abs(100*(1 - (abs(angle)/90))
 Kokoz: because even when the angle is positive the result could be negative
 Kokoz: it is done. Probably it is the worst code ever, but it works now :D
 Kokoz: I was using if at one line instead of elif, so it works fine now 
 zhoubou: :tada:
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: poor me&#160;?*
 eulerscheZahl: if i would torture you with a new puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: as you want 100% solved
 Stilgart: well, I almost got bored about being at 100% while doing nothing :D
 eulerscheZahl: i have a high rage-quit on some of them
 Stilgart: but kakuro and freecell are on the way
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, these are real work
 Stilgart: I really do not want to solve freecell&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i wrote a kakuro solver long ago
 Stilgart: (personnal taste)

 Stilgart: 424 is either too high or too low
 Astrobytes: Your dislike of board games on here also extends to card games Stilgart?
 Stilgart: StilgartLevel 10Solved 274 out of 741 problems
 Stilgart: hum... 
 eulerscheZahl: i'm at 280 :D
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: I dislike coding a solver for a game I play
 eulerscheZahl: and started working on a Freecell solver. but then got turned off by autoplay
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: That's fair enough.

 Stilgart: (and I am pretty sure it is not that hard)
 Stilgart: 551 should be easy
 Stilgart: (i solved that one, probably to put some colleague back to work)
 eulerscheZahl: there are a lot among the newer ones that i haven't even opened
 Stilgart: yep... 7xx already
 eulerscheZahl: i just now realized that the did a redesign of the web interface
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, 228 looks doable i think
 eulerscheZahl: but it can be hard despite looking easy at first
 Stilgart: I can't decide... and I have not enough faith to try
 derp22: Is there a method to get the length of a python list?
 Stilgart: damned, I can't access chadok.info from here
 zhoubou: derp22: len()
 zhoubou: len(list)
 eulerscheZahl: "from here"where are you?

 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: I am in my office right now
 eulerscheZahl: you are solving them much more in order than me
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: I stopped long ago
 eulerscheZahl: my "office" is just the power button on the other computer
 Stilgart: went go at some point to get the "solved last 5 puzzles"
 Stilgart: went *back*
 eulerscheZahl: 362. that's pretty much the exact time I started on PE
 eulerscheZahl: when i was still a freshman
 eulerscheZahl: some silver coin was the latest back then
 Stilgart: anyway, it is easy to get 100% on CG :D
 Stilgart: compared to PE
 eulerscheZahl: definitely
 eulerscheZahl: but you need a higher tolerance to boring and repeating problems
 Stilgart: by the way, here is my PE key 131688_8bdb59844d6c12a16b81241118111b06
 Stilgart: GuegoLevel 26Solved 651 out of 741 problems
 eulerscheZahl: now I have 5 friends
 Stilgart: damned him...
 Stilgart: It won't be easy to catch him :D
 Stilgart: and 228 is hard
 eulerscheZahl: i'm easy on the other hand
 eulerscheZahl: just 6 apart
 Stilgart: it is also the first unsolved one of Guego
 eulerscheZahl: Stilgart last soled a problem 1756 days ago
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl last soled a problem 370 days ago
 Stilgart: that was 551, Boulet told me it was hard, so I solved it :D
 eulerscheZahl: is boulet still active?
 eulerscheZahl: btw haven't seen him on CG lately either
 Stilgart: you won't see him except during contests
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even remember him as a contest player
 eulerscheZahl: sure, he looked into it. but for me he's a puzzle solver
 eulerscheZahl: you are too
 Stilgart: he is more a contest player actually
 Stilgart: (I bring the ideas, he manages to exploit them)
 Stilgart: and I am completely a puzzle player
 eulerscheZahl: next time report your ideas to me directly
 Stilgart: would be nice to have a new optim contest, by the way
 eulerscheZahl: or any contest
 Stilgart: as soon as you subscribe to the turtle team&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: how do I do that?
 Stilgart: BlaiseEbuth: go go go convince euler
 Stilgart: see BlaiseEbuth's profile
 eulerscheZahl: ping BlaiseEbuthsay something so i have a quick link
 Stilgart: having friendly team ready for the next contest would be fun too
 BlaiseEbuth: We are labeled "Great Place To Be" eZ&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: and where do you place that label?
 Stilgart: for the time being, you have to put turtle in place of siemens
 Stilgart: but we might have a third category for the next contest (hopefully)
 eulerscheZahl: hm, oknot a loss for the company leaderboard, i'm alone anyways
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah \o/
 eulerscheZahl: not even offered via autocomplete
 Stilgart: turtle inc is not a real company, they said&#160;:(

 Astrobytes: Well... we're not psychic...

 Showya: are y´all older than 16
 Elininja: Add a decade there for me xD
 SwagColoredKitteh: i have 11 years of experience in being 16
 Elininja: That's a great way to put it
 SwagColoredKitteh:&#160;;)
 Showya: im only twelve and i have 6 months and almost close of programming and partnering up with a company
 Showya: hello
 Showya: anyone there
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: giving up on everything is not so good for the ecosystem actually
 Showya: im low at this new game that i found it helps me practice
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: I didn't give up on everything, I eat cheese and other animal products. Occasionally fish.
 Showya: bro what
 Astrobytes: Stilgart: I also agree that if everyone gave up it would not be good at all. Mass production/farming is the main issue (grain/animals/whatever).
 Stilgart: "A card is a piece of two-sided B8 laminated paper." that's JBM for you
 Stilgart: at least, this contribution is not underspecified&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Haha! FreeCell I presume.
 JBM: well you wouldn't want someone coming in with yet another stupid question about something not being in the statement, would you?
 JBM: I know I wouldn't
 Showya: can yall spam nothing but yes please
 JBM: sure can
 eulerscheZahl: but do we need more detail than for RAIC?
 JBM: haven't opened raic yet
 Showya: ok so can one spam yes
 eulerscheZahl: finals are over, you missed it
 JBM: naaaaw
 Astrobytes: Was fun
 JBM: still 11 months or so
 JBM: look forward
 eulerscheZahl: maybe a mini raic in between
 Stilgart: JBM: I do have a question
 JBM: don't we all
 Stilgart: are we sure that automoves will not ruin a game&#160;?
 JBM: good question
 Showya: &lt;html&gt; 
 JBM: i think not
 JBM: but i don't have a proof
 eulerscheZahl: it's what made me stop testplaying
 JBM: i'll make them disablable anyway
 JBM: ...when time permits
 JBM: but considering solutions in the great freecell db are given with them assumed
 JBM: i'm 80% sure it's ok
 Showya: well if auto move messes the game up what would that do to you guys depending on the different codes you can change that movement to not auto running you do know that right
 Astrobytes: ^automaton NN has produced offspring.
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i mean: yes
 Showya: ok
 Showya: so try different codes to disable auto running
 Showya: brb
 Kitkat260: who wants to do clash of code
 Astrobytes: Users in the clash lobby.
 Kitkat260: umm what
 Astrobytes: You know. The lobby. Where people wait for people to join their clash...
 Kitkat260: ok
 Kitkat260: what other lobbies r there
 Showya: lol gottem
 Showya: ill do clash of code
 Showya: i was bouta say clash of clans
 RyanGilbert: i gotta learn ruby for golf
 RyanGilbert: ruby wins 9/10 times
 nicola: You got to learn rugby for golf?
 nicola: :thumbsup:
 Stilgart: I would like to see trump trying rugby
 Astrobytes: Perhaps if he was the ball...
 Showya: you do know Obama and Biden paid the Chinese government to make the covid-19 right and trump tried to stop it but opions are opions
 MSmits: ^
 Kitkat260: I choose Obama 
 Astrobytes: MSmits: are 'opions' some newly discovered particle?
 Astrobytes: (see above if you missed it)
 MSmits: no i saw it
 MSmits: my first thought was drugs
 MSmits: like opium
 MSmits: opioids?
 Astrobytes: Good point. Opiod ions.
 MSmits: ah yes
 MSmits: scientists that dropped their stash into the accelerator and ionized it
 Astrobytes: *Opioid.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Has old john made a proper bot now?
 MSmits: I think he has an ok bot, but he;s mainly just counterbooking me
 Astrobytes: Ah right.
 MSmits: he puts new moves in, then submits until it drops me below jacek
 MSmits: then waits
 MSmits: I love it
 Astrobytes: Playing you at your own game, so to speak :D
 MSmits: yes
 Kitkat260: guys i'm sad
 Showya: bruh i said one thing to yall making another world
 Kitkat260:&#160;??
 reCurse: This is not your schoolyard.
 Astrobytes: Showya: Give it a rest. You've been spouting balderdash for hours.
 MSmits: I think he meant another word, but not sure. Maybe he needs to work on his spelling before worrying about geopolitical issues
 Ace1234: Ek
 Kitkat260: hey ace
 Ace1234: Hi
 Kitkat260: hru
 Ace1234: I'm in a clash
 Kitkat260: nice
 Showya: atrobytes you are like 2 time my age and im smarter than you shut up
 Astrobytes: Merci BlaiseEbuth
 Astrobytes: I guess he'll be back in a minute
 reCurse: I would have banned
 BlaiseEbuth: of course, but I follow the procedure
 BlaiseEbuth: warn -&gt; kick -&gt; ban
 reCurse: Too nice
 BlaiseEbuth: Last time I directly banned I had complaints...&#160;:/
 reCurse: From? The banned? Happens to me all the time.
 reCurse: Ignore them.
 reCurse: No patience for 'tough' school kids.
 BlaiseEbuth: I take note of that.
 Astrobytes: Perhaps we need AutomatonMod
 eulerscheZahl: Stilgart 05:33PMI would like to see trump trying rugby
 Astrobytes: Yes. That pretty much sums him up.
 eulerscheZahl: lastweektonight was a little more differentiated about him. that he sometimes just acts clueless to seem less harmful
 Astrobytes: No, to clarify I mean it sums up his attitude to anyone he considers lesser than him. Child or not.
 Astrobytes: He plays on the bumbling idiot thing yes.
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Stilgart: hahaha
 Astrobytes: He's a ruthless bully who just wants to be The Winner all the time. Somewhat politically incompetent, but desperate for the power.
 Astrobytes: Anyway, enough. I live this every day.
 Dan_is_a_Moron: yeah same 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know that much about UK politics. the English media I watch is mostly from the US
 eulerscheZahl: sure, I understand this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aGpKNRZ_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aGpKNRZ_700bwp.webp</a>

 Kitkat260: hi dan
 Dan_is_a_Moron: im not dan dan is a moron 
 Kitkat260: oh my bad
 Jamie_is_a_moron: Im  Dan
 eulerscheZahl: then i'll call you Peter
 Kitkat260: hi dan is a moron
 Dan_is_a_Moron: nahhhh my name is jamie 
 reCurse: Enough of this crap, bans will be handed out.
 Jamie_is_a_moron: woahhh
 eulerscheZahl: :zipper_mouth:
 Dan_is_a_Moron: oooooo scary 
 Jamie_is_a_moron: your the one getting poltical
 Jamie_is_a_moron: im just here talking about code
 Kitkat260: :weary:
 Jamie_is_a_moron: wow 
 Jamie_is_a_moron: you banned my friend for nothing 
 reCurse: Holidays are over huh.
 eulerscheZahl: in Germany they got extended
 Csharp_King: what a lovely day 
 reCurse: So still no school in germany?
 eulerscheZahl: starts on 10th i think. then mostly remote.I admit i'm not that much into it as it doesn't affect me directly
 PaulBeziau: i
 reCurse: I thought it would be much more drastic in UK. Oh well.
 eulerscheZahl: was a discussion if lower grades should go to school or remote for all
 eulerscheZahl: we can still meet 1 person from another household. used to be 5 from 2 houses and kids didn't even count to that total of 56
 eulerscheZahl: of 5
 struct: here its all going like nothing is wrong. But today we broke the max of 10k people infected in 24 hours....
 eulerscheZahl: and you have a much lower population
 reCurse: Yeah at least you were allowed some sort of christmas
 struct: yeah 10mill
 Megha.Akash: Hi. I have a doubt here. The quest in the home says to Accept or Reject a contribution. But I couldn't see any Approve or Reject button enabled under any of the individual contribution which are "Ready". How to Approve or Reject any contribution?
 struct: for coc you need to  have 50 clashes played
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/58651bfa0e7d1fe9864e5cccf83acc51eb37">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/58651bfa0e7d1fe9864e5cccf83acc51eb37</a>
 eulerscheZahl: do you see approve/reject there?
 Megha.Akash: Yeah. I played 50 clashes
 eulerscheZahl: also it's public clashes I think
 eulerscheZahl: did you play some private ones?
 eulerscheZahl: they don't count
 Megha.Akash: Yeah Public ones
 Megha.Akash: No, I can't see Approve or Reject there
 Megha.Akash: I also tested a contribution in the IDE to check if it enables the options. But no.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/whog54">https://prnt.sc/whog54</a>nope?
 struct: maybe an extension is blocking it?
 eulerscheZahl: you are at 44 clashes
 eulerscheZahl: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=keyword&amp;value=megha">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=keyword&amp;value=megha</a>.
 eulerscheZahl: 6 more and you get these buttons
 Megha.Akash: But I completed the whole path for CoC
 eulerscheZahl: it's confusing I know
 Megha.Akash: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes they count all clashes, sometimes private ones don't count
 eulerscheZahl: for moderation it's public ones only
 Megha.Akash: Oh ok. Thanks @eulerscheZahl
 Westicles: Yeah, the counts are screwy.  I had to click through 55 times to get 50 for some reason
 eulerscheZahl: they only count when they are finished. that is each player in the clash submitted
 Westicles: Well, you get the quest achievement at the real 50, but mod rights at the 55.  At least for me
 Astrobytes: No schools opening in UK until after January
 Astrobytes: argh, chat scroll
 Stilgart: seems not as bad as here&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: 1 in 50 infected in England, not sure about Scotland.England were going to open schools until the teachers union told no teachers to go back
 Westicles: In the US we have to wait for the black market to open for vaccine passports
 Astrobytes: That wouldn't even be surprising tbh.
 Westicles: It'll be necessary soon for a bunch of activities.  Better than untested mRNA
 SwagColoredKitteh: vaccinate me already plz
 SwagColoredKitteh: that's my stance
 Westicles: CaN I haz your passport?
 SwagColoredKitteh: don't you get the passport from taking the vaccine?
 SwagColoredKitteh: you need it for the vaccine?
 SwagColoredKitteh: i think i may have something mixed up
 Westicles: You need it as proof you got the jab
 SwagColoredKitteh: o
 SwagColoredKitteh: right right
 SwagColoredKitteh: more reasons to get the vacc
 Westicles: 30-50% of health care workers (varies with geography) in the US are declining.  they are all going to get fired eventually without paperwork, so a market will form
 Kitkat260:&#160;???
 Kitkat260: what do u mean?
 jacek: AutmatonNN huh
 jacek: AutomatonNN even
 AutomatonNN: sorry, have you tried to use a vector and start a coding contest
 MSmits: did you try a vector again? silly jacek
 struct: did you manage to avx your code jace K?
 eulerscheZahl: have you tried to turn it off and on again?
 jacek: nope
 Westicles: CG has HW that supports avx512?
 struct: no
 Kitkat260: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://quizlet.com/live">https://quizlet.com/live</a>
 Kitkat260: plz join
 struct: avx2, also it supports fma
 Kitkat260: code is 804-606
 Megha.Akash: Thanks a lot @eulerschezahl and @struct. I was able to Approve after playing 50 public clashes
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: reach lvl20 and you can approve other types of contributions too
 Westicles: They are lining up to approve Shakespeare :P
 Kitkat260: can someone help me with coding
 Kitkat260: The game mode is REVERSE: You do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the following set of tests: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5305d709-1b22-4294-a457-7fc93660727c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5305d709-1b22-4294-a457-7fc93660727c</a>
 Megha.Akash: It is just converting the integers to the respective ASCII characters @KitKat
 jacek: ascii magic
 jacek: but you should do it yourself
 eulerscheZahl: nah, let's do this together
 struct: also if you dont give us the inputs
 struct: we wont guess
 Kitkat260: umm ok
 jacek: there are
 struct: ah wait
 struct: I see
 eulerscheZahl: print(<i>.join(chr(int(c)) for c in input().split()))</i>
 struct: just confusing
 Kitkat260: i am so confused
 Westicles: one that easy wouldn't get approved these days
 jacek: for reverse?
 Kitkat260: i got test one right
 Kitkat260: i'm dead
 jacek: hi dead, im dad
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a problem in raising the standards
 Kitkat260: :rage:
 Kitkat260: thats me in coding
 Astrobytes: Then find another hobby.
 eulerscheZahl: you are dad, jacek?you pulled an automaton it seems <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/Mz0eKZz">https://imgur.com/a/Mz0eKZz</a>
 Kitkat260: jacek lol
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Kitkat260: Astrobytes shut up please
 Stilgart: omg....
 Astrobytes: Excuse me Kitkat260?
 soutenu: what up?
 eulerscheZahl: may I take a kick, Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Yes, you may.
 Kitkat260: just please 
 eulerscheZahl: my first of the year&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: You volunteered!
 Westicles: picking on 14.5 year old girls... tsk tsk
 Kitkat260: i'm sorry
 Megha.Akash: Could someone please comment on my contribution for Clash of Code?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/604966d6b8bb9b27ed1e2668aec89656d894">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/604966d6b8bb9b27ed1e2668aec89656d894</a>
 Westicles: Takes more than 5 minutes to read
 Astrobytes: Any kind of comment or a meaningful one?
 Megha.Akash: Meaningful one. If it is OK for a clash, please do approve
 Megha.Akash: I have just explained the rotation @Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I was just joking Megha.Akash, I don't clash personally so I'll leave it to those who do.
 Megha.Akash: Oh ok :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm with Astrobytes about the approval. but on a first looks it seems fine: interesting enough and the right level of difficulty
 Megha.Akash: Oh thanks @eulerschezahl
 Astrobytes: Agreed, I don't see any issues on a quick glance at at.
 Astrobytes: *it
 Megha.Akash: Thanks @Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Megha.Akash you don't need the @, just typing a username automatically pings the user
 Astrobytes: (here in chat I mean, not your clash)
 Megha.Akash: Oh
 Megha.Akash: Ok  Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No problem Megha.Akash
 zhoubou: The statement confused me at first. Had to have a very close look at the examples until I got it. Might be just me being dumb is all :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: next hint: autocompletionast[tab] =&gt; Astrobytes
 Megha.Akash: Oh wow. Nice eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: (I left that one for you euler :P )

 eulerscheZahl: i'm not paying 100% attention to the chat
 Astrobytes: I'm not either
 Westicles: Megha.Akash, it would be better if your example matched the first test case
 eulerscheZahl: what's about that comment SAChamp?
 Megha.Akash: Oh ok Westicles. I will add another test case then
 SAChamp: eulerscheZahl copied wrong link, just wanted to share the contribution
 SAChamp: can someone verify it from C++ point of view
 SAChamp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5866fc6d162ae0159c659d494069547fc39a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5866fc6d162ae0159c659d494069547fc39a</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i can confirm that such large numbers are a problem in many languages
 eulerscheZahl: and also the stub generator complain (which could be seen as a bug of the generator)
 SAChamp: I corrected that
 eulerscheZahl: the limit is 2^64 - 1
 SAChamp: I wanted large numbers for test cases
 eulerscheZahl: but other languages like javascript even allow less
 eulerscheZahl: and stub should use long instead of int
 Astrobytes: C++ string splitting isn't quite as trivial as split() but then, who the hell uses C++ in clashes
 Astrobytes: (to be competitive that is)
 SAChamp: True that, Astrobytes
 Westicles: Everyone else is done before I finish googling tokenize for the millionth time
 SAChamp: eulerscheZahl corrected the stub, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: should still support all languages and not make it even harder for some of them
 SAChamp: 10^20 is less than 2^64, should i reduce it further to 10^15?
 Astrobytes: afk 2 mins
 eulerscheZahl: did you check the default code in python?
 eulerscheZahl: uppercase I is not an option as it gets lowercase in some languages

 Nuwaisir: no sorry&#160;:(
 Nuwaisir: Im typing from codingame page
 Nuwaisir: So, I should join the discord server first...
 eulerscheZahl: to spam invites there? no!
 Megha.Akash: What are the channels available here? This is the first time I'm hearing about the #clash channel. 
 Nuwaisir: why would it be a spam -_-
 Westicles: Almost everyone who isn't new hates clashes
 zhoubou: Nuwaisir #clash channel is right here on Codingame website. Just click on it or type "/join clash" to join.
 Westicles: #in #fr #de #ru is all I know
 eulerscheZahl: there are more country channels. but fr and ru are the most active ones

 MSmits: hey, there are many things he could choose to do
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: does anyone know why isaplha() doesnt work on python 3 anymore?
 Astrobytes: because you spelled it wrong?
 SPDene: because you misspelled isalpha()&#160;?

 MSmits: :p
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_tiling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_tiling</a>
 Wontonimo: I'll be sure to google puzzles in the future to make sure there isn't a published answer.  Honestly, I just rolled up my sleeves and coded it.  It did feel easier than 'hard'.
 VizGhar: Hey guys. Can you recommend some easier puzzles for clojure? I need to resolve 4 more to get that legend clojure achievement and get rid of that language forever :D
 VizGhar: ideally from medium puzzles
 Wontonimo: solving the same problem in a different language counts towards your progress to legend
 Wontonimo: but that doesn't sound very legend, so don't do that
 Westicles: Westicles looking for the right emoji...
 VizGhar: there are about 30 languages * 15 problems... thats quite a lot :F
 struct: puzzles that require only a formula are good
 struct: also optimizations that you get 100% just by submiting still count for achievement
 Wontonimo: ^ now that is just sad.  very un-legend
 struct: Yeah, I dont do it, Im just saying its possible
 struct: Also I dont think there are many optimizations you can get 100% just by submiting
 Wontonimo: @VizGhar - we were just talking about "Paving with bricks".  Try doing that without googling it
 Wontonimo: also "Stock Exchange Losses" I found particularly easy 
 Wontonimo: but not with clojure.  i don't do clojure
 DomiKo: struct I believe only 2048 is such opti
 VizGhar: A*-craft too
 DomiKo: ohhh yeah
 DomiKo: so only 2
 VizGhar: euler himself mentioned it :D

 struct: the reverse engineer one doesnt work?
 VizGhar: aha... might as well
 DomiKo: I got 0%
 DomiKo: Console.WriteLine("A, B, C, D or E")
 DomiKo: you have to change one line
 VizGhar: yup
 DomiKo: beacuse template ouput is invalid
 DomiKo: lul
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: its funny
 Wontonimo: It would be really nice to have a filter in "Contribute" for WIP
 DomiKo: deafult code in 2048
 DomiKo: got timeout
 DomiKo: in Ocaml
 Westicles: scala?
 Westicles: oh
 DomiKo: Ocaml have a global problem?
 VizGhar: Yeah I'm looking at stock exchange looses and default code cannot be compiled for Clojure
 VizGhar: you can find such puzzles
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: When you think a puzzle should be set to a different level please don't approve until it is confirmed by others and done.
 Westicles: Stub checking for weirdo languages is rare
 Astrobytes: pardouin: if you are here, thank you.
 pardouin: np
 pardouin: what for btw? ^^
 Astrobytes: lol
 Wontonimo: thanks Astrobytes.  I agree 100% and I'll do that in the future
 Astrobytes: downgrading the puzzle to medium
 Wontonimo: it already was
 Astrobytes: pardouin
 Wontonimo: I just checked minutes ago
 pardouin: I just did yes
 Astrobytes: He changed it 10 mins ago
 Astrobytes: or more
 Wontonimo: Thanks everyone.
 Astrobytes: No worries
 Westicles: I was always afraid changing difficulty would break links, but the hard one still seems to work

 Astrobytes: It still shows up in the relevant section, but linking to it you can write whatever you like
 Astrobytes: We had fun with it a while ago, I think dbdr noticed it? Could be wrong.

 Westicles: Or be able to turn it off, I should say
 struct: what do you mean Westicles?
 Westicles: Right now it autoplays some moves (like the real game).  Some of us were complaining that made it tougher to solves
 AntiSquid: imo something like freecell would have been inevitably get accepted by regulars either way
 Salted: I hope I'm not interrupting. Does anyone know if R has or could be planned for codingame?

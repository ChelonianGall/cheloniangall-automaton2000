 StepBack13: Allis your 44 character Ruby code for counting vowels is doing my head it. How did you reduce$&gt;&lt;&lt;gets.split.map{|w|w.scan(/[aeiou]/i).size}*" "
 StepBack13: Amazed you can shave 6 characters off that
 StepBack13: Wish you'd shared
 Hugo-NL: anybody know if possible to migrate my profile to another e-mail&#160;?
 JBM: what have you tried?
 Hugo-NL: tried finding options
 jacek: do you want to just change your email?
 BuonOmo: StepBack w.count("aeiou")
 Hugo-NL: i did find something, trying now
 StepBack13: Thanks BuonOmo but it is upper and lowercase.I've got it down to 46:$&gt;&lt;&lt;gets.split.map{|w|w.count'aeouiAEIOU'}*" "
 Allis: There's a 44-character approach with #gsub.
 JBM: "count and print the mixed-case vowels in a single line of input", is that it?
 Allis: It's vowels per word, so "foo bar" =&gt; 2 1
 JBM: ah, ok
 JBM: lemme try
 BuonOmo: Trying with the gsub approach, everything is &gt; 46 yet!
 Allis: What's your regex?
 BuonOmo: $&gt;&lt;&lt;gets.gsub(/[aeiou]/i, ?1).map{|w|w.count(?1)}*" "
 Allis: Ah, that won't do. /\S+/ is sufficient.
 Allis: $&gt;&lt;&lt;gets.gsub(/\S+/){|m|m.count'AEIOUaeiou'} is the 44 I came up with, but I feel like there's room for improvement.
 Allis: It'd be great if MatchData objects would just implicitly act like Strings, but I can how that'd be a little messy.
 BuonOmo: oh i didn't know that $&gt;&lt;&lt;Enumerator would print space separated results! Thanks&#160;:)
 Allis: It won't...
 mikemilia: Hello, Im new here. I was reading about the topic "Basic simulation and evaluation". Im not a native english speaker, does someone knows what a "pod" is or can give me a link to a definition?
 Allis: What it does is replace the runs of non-whitespace (the words, in this case) with their vowel counts, so the spaces just stay untouched.
 BuonOmo: of course, my bad ^^
 BuonOmo: well played
 Allis: No worries. Happy to share... sometimes. :P
 JBM: ok almost there except for mixcase
 JBM: tripping on punctuation
 AntiSquid: twilightsnowflake, now that's an interesting username
 JBM: there, all clear
 JBM: 37 in perl :p
 BuonOmo: still in ruby, trying other approach not working though $\=" ";gets.split{|m|print m.count'AEIOUaeiou'}

 BuonOmo: what's going on here?
 jacek: invalid paste id eh
 BuonOmo: but I was just writting text, got changed into that weird paste bin after i hit enter
 jacek: its automatic so to prevent spamming code
 jacek: though there is some bug recently
 jacek: so youd beter pastebin your own and link it
 BuonOmo: ok so maybe posting in many times will do
 BuonOmo: Was saying, the clash where a boy moves in a room of size 31x11, starting at 0 0 according to the music: {"ts"=&gt;[-1,0],"boom"=&gt;[1,0],"ding"=&gt;[0,-1],"bing"=&gt;[0,1]}
 Allis: @BuonOmo I'm able to get 116 courtesy of the #clamp method.
 BuonOmo: @Allis then I guess we had the same idea, with clamp i'm 121.Just tried a new idea though, i think i'm 89 (don't have the input anymore&#160;:'( )
 eulerscheZahl: ping Q12

 Q12: Ok
 Q12: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: the ones you gave are IDE links. they only work for your account
 Q12: ohhhh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/3214013247b916f448e1f08c0063992e5b0d950c">https://www.codingame.com/ide/3214013247b916f448e1f08c0063992e5b0d950c</a>
 Q12: Thanks a lot
 eulerscheZahl: oops, not what i wanted to share
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/urt10y">https://prnt.sc/urt10y</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i meant edit your previous postwait, I can even do that myself now
 Q12: I can't edit it
 Q12: there is a problem
 eulerscheZahl: you can't? strange
 eulerscheZahl: I changed the links
 Q12: Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: maybe I should remove your reply with the fixed links now :thinking:
 Q12: Thanks :grinning: I don't know why but I have few problems with the edit and deleting of posts
 eulerscheZahl: maybe your account is too new and you haven't unlocked that feature, I don't know
 Astrobytes: Either way, I like the idea
 eulerscheZahl: they are nice puzzles to introduce to those concepts
 eulerscheZahl: and way too hidden
 Q12: Thanks Astrobytes love to hear your feedback in the topic :wink:
 Astrobytes: Sure, I'll write something later today&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: would also be a place for things like a normal tic tac toe (without the ultimate) as a minimax introduction
 Astrobytes: Yep, I think it would keep users on the site, as opposed to trawling the web looking for explanations etc (which is still advisable, but you get what I mean)
 eulerscheZahl: one could also link those with the tags
 Astrobytes: Yes, indeed
 eulerscheZahl: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/flood-fill">https://www.codingame.com/learn/flood-fill</a>
 eulerscheZahl: which links to other websites
 Q12: Like it eulerscheZahl, but write in the topic... so everyone could see it
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, i'm illiterate, can't write&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: nonsense
 eulerscheZahl: ok, you got me. after lunch
 Q12: Thanks :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: yay, I rock at this tag: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/urt9mt">https://prnt.sc/urt9mt</a>
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure that one of the tags even had an animated gif. but which one was it?
 eulerscheZahl: i thought it was floodfill but there is no animation
 Astrobytes: Hm, that was my first thought. Some other graph-based tag?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm searching
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html">https://chadok.info/codingame/tags_list.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: didn't click the right one yet
 wlesavo: anime based tags
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo: anime bass me if you know what i mean
 Astrobytes: nope
 eulerscheZahl: wow, Trump got Covid19
 Astrobytes: Yeah.
 Astrobytes: Gets him out of any presidential debates I suppose
 eulerscheZahl: he didn't do much more than interrupting Biden anyways
 Astrobytes: And talking crap/being insulting
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't have to comment on the tags anymore, someone else was faster
 wlesavo: or one may say you were slower
 Astrobytes: No you should elaborate further (I'm not letting you off with this now :P )
 eulerscheZahl: i hate redundancy
 Astrobytes: The user didn't mention external resources at all
 eulerscheZahl: my post would have been a little more verbose but it's fine as it is
 eulerscheZahl: i'll decide after lunch
 Astrobytes: lol
 wlesavo: nice quote from cnnAt 74 years old and obese, Trump falls into the highest risk category for serious complications from the disease
 eulerscheZahl: that would be one way to decide the election
 Astrobytes: Good. I mean I don't wish death on anybody but he kinda deserves this
 eulerscheZahl: it common sense isn't enough to handle it, let's wait for the nature to strike back
 jacek: but is he really sick tho
 jacek: i bet when debate dates are over, hell miraclously be healthy again
 eulerscheZahl: according to his twitter messages he's sick for years
 eulerscheZahl: mentally at least
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: And yeah jacek, I considered that possibility too
 AntiSquid: idk, think they need younger candidates on both sides, regardless of view, there are millions of americans to pick from, why risk getting those with health issues?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, surely the 2 geriatric white guys thing is getting a bit stale now eh
 AntiSquid: obama and romney looked in very good health by comparison
 AntiSquid: and their debate sounded a lot more civilized
 AntiSquid: from both sides .
 Astrobytes: The bar for civility was not high wrt that debate the other day :P
 AntiSquid: just found out few weeks ago mcaffee ran for president too at some point
 Astrobytes: As in John McAfee?
 AntiSquid: ya the antivirus guy
 AntiSquid: who ditched his own antivirus because of what became of it
 Astrobytes: yeah I know him lol
 Astrobytes: Didn't know he ran in the presidentials
 AntiSquid: he ran this year too apparently, but not as strong as in a previous attempt
 AntiSquid: it's all about how much screen time the media gives you for sure
 AntiSquid: although he is a bit weird, he's still more coherent than other candidates
 Astrobytes: Money, the more money you throw at it and the more people in your pocket the easier it is to run
 Astrobytes: Also getting high profile backers helps
 AntiSquid: i forgot which book by dan brown i've read, but one subplot was detailing the presidential elections very well :D
 AntiSquid: yes money 
 AntiSquid: lobbying&#160;! that's the key-word i was looking for
 Astrobytes: Yep. Really not how you should conduct affairs is it. Most countries are lobbied by all sorts of companies but the US doesn't even bother to keep it quiet
 Astrobytes: companies/individuals
 jacek: simpsons did it again? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2020/08/28/921642-trump-simpsons.jpg">https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2020/08/28/921642-trump-simpsons.jpg</a>
 MadKnight: did simpsons predict Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i wonder what the hell is that
 Aka_nate458: Sup how yall doing&#160;:)
 Schwase: anyone have any thoughts on a kakuro/cross-sums classic puzzle? I was thinking of doing the input like a crossword puzzles and not like the typical syntax because it'd be organizationally desirable
 Allis: @Schwase Perhaps base your decision on how much code it takes you to write your parser?
 LastRick: What about a grid of # (black) and . (white) for the board and a list of sums similar to the nonogram-inversor problem?
 Schwase: i was thinking of doing that but the leading cells would be replaced with a letter and then, like in crosswords, there would be a list of downs (A 3 B 10 etc) and cross's (A 4 C 35 etc)
 Schwase: alternatively, i could just use the binary # and . board and then list "x y S"
 Schwase: but i think i would also need direction
 Bob: I think your first idea is fine
 Schwase: ok
 Bob: just make it clear that the same letter may be used for both down and across
 Schwase: yes
 Schwase: is using puzzles from dell magazine immoral or improper?
 JBM: prolly both
 Bob: yea
 JBM: unless they granted you permission, naturally
 Bob: so go ahead and just do it
 LastRick: hah
 Schwase: i did pay for it
 JBM: that usally grants a license to read
 Bob: I did pay for the last digital music I've bought, that still doesn't allow me to pass it around
 Schwase: yeah it says violations punishable by death in the book
 Schwase: shucks
 Schwase: i could just mirror it
 Schwase: probably wouldnt be that hard to make unique puzzles
 JBM: that's derivative work
 Bob: however I'm pretty sure you can find loads of free puzzles on the internets
 Bob: as in free to use
 Schwase: once i get a working solution coded i could just test that there is only 1 solution
 JBM: "just"
 Bob: but really the bottom line is&#160;: nobody's going to look up the validators of a CG community puzzle and check whether they are violating some copyright
 Schwase: ill check for free puzzles first tho
 Schwase: that was a good suggestions
 jrke: did pastebin broked again?

 JBM: wow, that expired fast
 JBM: and i thought i was a fast clicker
 Bob: fix it
 eulerscheZahl: maybe I just wrote a random link that only looks like a pastebin?

 JBM: yeah, close but no cigar
 eulerscheZahl: this is not markdown
 JBM: it's html at the xmpp level
 JBM: reinterpreted by stanza
 eulerscheZahl: you can use wiki syntax and then look at dbdr's chat history the next day
 JBM: lol
 JBM: i'm fine with hanlon on this one
 MadKnight: u wanted to try html inside a paste&#160;?
 JBM: i wanted to check how obvious it would be to fake a CG-pastebin message
 MadKnight: why did u place it inside &lt;&gt;
 JBM: i didn't
 MadKnight: but why is there a &lt;&gt;
 JBM: some cg/stanza "magic"

 eulerscheZahl: the URL looks suspiciously non-random
 MadKnight: "12345678-" 100% not made up
 JBM: no needto look at the url

 sunksuperset370: yes pun intended
 sunksuperset370: please don't be mad
 sunksuperset370: i was having a  bad day so i was just trying to figure out what i need to do to make me happy, but making puns isn't helping not
 jacek: oh my
 sunksuperset370: i missed school so now i am going to be punished by my dad
 sunksuperset370: why are your surprised
 MadKnight: why are u trying to figure something out when u can just code something&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: i am doing that too
 sunksuperset370: but when you are stuck in a place and don't find a hole to get up, you would feel very well
 sunksuperset370: wouldn
 sunksuperset370: tt
 The_Auditor: what happened with the school? you missed the bus/
 sunksuperset370: so i am just doing three things at a time
 sunksuperset370: yes i did
 sunksuperset370: slept too long
 sunksuperset370: like an idiot
 sunksuperset370: but tbh i actually didn't want to go either
 jacek: so dont tell your dad [solved]
 sunksuperset370: i have to
 sunksuperset370: or my aunt will
 sunksuperset370: then my dad will get even angrier 
 sunksuperset370: by me not telling him
 The_Auditor: the aunt missed the school bus too?
 sunksuperset370: nope
 sunksuperset370: she 60
 sunksuperset370: plus i already told him
 sunksuperset370: so i don't give my aunt to tell him
 sunksuperset370: my aunt a chance^^^^
 The_Auditor: what to do when your school experiment shows result that go against multiple existing studies?
 MadKnight: why did u sleep too long&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: don't know why
 sunksuperset370: and what do your mean experment shows result that go against multiple existing studies
 MadKnight: u actually got a nice way out - just solve puzzles/multis the entire school time so when your dad comes back u can tell him u didn't waste this time
 sunksuperset370: i didn't get the q
 The_Auditor: ... that is a change of topic
 sunksuperset370: well i have to do school work from my school chromebook
 MadKnight: why didn't u wake up the right time&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: don't know
 MadKnight: what's school chromebook&#160;?\
 JBM: ask sleepy him
 sunksuperset370: nono
 sunksuperset370: now because of covid a lot of school have given chromebooks to students so they can also attend school from home
 sunksuperset370: rather than going to school physically
 MadKnight: but what is this chromebook&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: its a laptop
 sunksuperset370: a crappy one that is
 sunksuperset370: its not linux
 The_Auditor: its an ARM bashed laptop with chrome OS
 MadKnight: what? no linux? terrible
 MadKnight: oh
 The_Auditor: ARM based
 MadKnight: Chrome OS is a Gentoo Linux–based operating system 
 sunksuperset370: long story short its really crappy
 sunksuperset370: can i cus
 sunksuperset370: i really want to
 sunksuperset370: even though i am using the chrome book to do so
 sunksuperset370: i am using the chormebook to insult it
 sunksuperset370: lol
 The_Auditor: usually cheaper but can't do as much on is as chrome OS is limiting access

 Shadowtick: can anyone help me with the scrabble coding practice
 MadKnight: yea i can
 jacek: chromeopeningbook?
 sunksuperset370: no
 sunksuperset370: the name is just chromebook
 sunksuperset370: its a small laptop
 sunksuperset370: that is really crappy
 Shadowtick: I am on a chromebook you know and I kinda like using it because it's easy for me to use
 Bob: it's not helping you with scrabble, though
 sunksuperset370: yep
 sunksuperset370: is it nw
 Shadowtick: no its more my fault because I am using javascript code and I am not good at it
 Shadowtick: and there isn't the code that I am used to using
 sunksuperset370: i use javascript
 Bob: so what problem do you have?
 sunksuperset370: what do you need help with
 jacek: using javascript, thats your problem, eh
 Bob: the trolling level here is too damn high
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 The_Auditor: hm? didn't see any trolling
 Shadowtick: I am more used to making things on p5.js
 Shadowtick: that is the easiest thing that I make stuff on
 Bob: doesn't seem to be very different, except that they provide a visualization API
 Bob: here you communicate with plain IO
 jacek: only thing you cant use fancy libraries on CG
 Bob: apart from that, it's plain JS
 Bob: you still didn't state the nature of your problem&#160;:)
 jacek: he did. "javascript"
 Schwase: i keep having a "oops memory" error while writing a contribution and if i have to rewrite my stub again im gonna throw hands
 Schwase: i think that when i tried to use the language selector dropdown the image is expensive to display
 Bob: git your stub
 Bob: (or, in fact, your entire contrib)
 jacek: or gut your stib
 Bob: poor stib
 Shadowtick: ...
 Bob: so, that scrabble?
 Shadowtick: I'm just gonna not talk that much on here anymore
 Bob: well I don't know, you're asking for help but we've asked several times what you're having trouble with and no answer
 Shadowtick: I am just needing to focus thats all
 Bob: ok
 Bob: lurking on the chat can indeed hinder one's focus
 Shadowtick: yeah especially me because of my adhd and autism
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Shadowtick JS's power is in it's easy access to the DOM without a huge amount of parsing and easy event triggerring.  The downside is the error handling imho, your functions can run, but can just get ignored and then your left with garbage with no idea where the problem is.  Just get used to writing all your variables to the console.log and writing show or .tostring functions to your objects. g/l.
 Shadowtick: ok?
 Shadowtick: but call me shadow for short
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you type the first couple chars of someone's name and hit tab in the chat it will auto fill the name and ping them  Shadowtick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: right PatrickMcGinnisII
 Shadowtick: oh can you please stop pinging me because I am trying to focus
 Shadowtick: I don't wanna see new message pop up every few seconds
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and that's why OG's like me stop encouraging people
 Bob: you can fold the chat section with the little arrow button on the bottom left of the chat
 Bob: or you can add ?disableChat=true o the end of your CG URL to disable it entirely
 Shadowtick: well I get sidetracked easily that's why I am asking and I know and when I fold it it still will show it
 Bob: I often do this when I don't want to get sidetracked by the chat
 Shadowtick: I have to leave it open because I am being helped by madknight still
 Bob: ok
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII /join Limbo</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: ?disableChat is enough already, you don't need the =true parrt

 eulerscheZahl: but I have a joke about UDP for youI don't care if you get it either
 Shadowtick: I stopped working on the scrabble one and started coders strike back
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not a user?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CSB, of course ... the mad one never stops with CSB
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler there's no protocol for me, I'm out there man
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the audio is definetely distorted
 The_Auditor: i don't think Coders strike back is the best chioce
 MadKnight: i didn't tell him about CSB
 Uljahn: Automaton2000 did
 Automaton2000: i just wanted to see where it gets me
 MadKnight: he said he's gonna practice his js in csb before he comes back with new knowledge
 MadKnight: i dunno who did but i didn't
 MadKnight: hey Shadowtick, how did u find coders strike back&#160;?
 Shadowtick: it was one of the paths I could do on my quest map I saw AI and I really wanted to make an AI so I clicked it and it took me to coders strike back
 jacek: well its the beginning
 Darko_green_LOrd: hello
 Darko_green_LOrd: any tips for the C#  ascii art&#160;? 
 Darko_green_LOrd: its really hard
 Schwase: the manhattan puzzle @Darko_green_LOrd
 Schwase:&#160;?
 Darko_green_LOrd: yes
 Darko_green_LOrd: i found code that solves it but i want to understand it not just skip it
 Schwase: ok
 The_Auditor: you feel the C# is hindering you or the puzzle is hard in general?
 Schwase: C# isnt the problem
 Darko_green_LOrd: well . i used autohotkey before
 Schwase: its just important to understand it
 Darko_green_LOrd: and most people say C# is closest
 Darko_green_LOrd: to autohotkey
 Schwase: do you not know C# then?
 Darko_green_LOrd: well it seems alot diferent
 Darko_green_LOrd: my friend told me this page helps teaching the language
 Darko_green_LOrd: but esay challenges seem to be not easy
 The_Auditor: you know any language other then autohotkey&#160;?
 Schwase: isnt autohotkey just a macro thing?
 Darko_green_LOrd: well , not that much
 eulerscheZahl: because c# has a much more sophisticated syntax. autohotkey was never designed for that
 Darko_green_LOrd: you can make alot of things in autohotkey
 Darko_green_LOrd: but C# is better
 Darko_green_LOrd: what programming langauge do you suggest me to start with when i was using autohotkey before&#160;? 
 Schwase: i know 1 language, this is not my area of expertise
 The_Auditor: if you are learning programming, then starting with javascript or python may be easier
 Schwase: python
 MadKnight: can u make a bot for a game in autohotkey&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: one that i would suggest to a complete beginner
 Darko_green_LOrd: yes
 eulerscheZahl: c#, java, python
 Darko_green_LOrd: you can @MadKnight
 Schwase: java worked out well for me
 Schwase: but python seems more supportive
 The_Auditor: and to learn the basics of programming i'd recommend <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codecombat.com/">https://codecombat.com/</a>
 The_Auditor: stay on the free option. my 8 year old learned python there
 Darko_green_LOrd: okay ill try
 Darko_green_LOrd: thanks 
 Darko_green_LOrd: so codingame is more advanced thing
 Darko_green_LOrd: not for starting&#160;?
 Schwase: you need the essential basics
 Schwase: but after that
 Schwase: its a great resource
 The_Auditor: you need to know the basics of loops and conditions
 Darko_green_LOrd: okay
 Darko_green_LOrd: i can learn that in codecombat right&#160;? 
 The_Auditor: yes
 MadKnight: Darko_green_LOrd codingame is the practice, when u know the basica
 MadKnight: s
 Darko_green_LOrd: okay thanks for help guys
 The_Auditor: read all the hints and tooltips
 Darko_green_LOrd: is there some setting for langages
 Darko_green_LOrd: or its straight set for python&#160;? 
 The_Auditor: 3 langs available
 The_Auditor: javascript python and coffeescript
 Darko_green_LOrd: what is the default one and if not python how do i change it&#160;?
 Schwase: @Euler are you familiar with crosssums/kakuro puzzles?
 The_Auditor: when you create your hero, there is a dropdown on the bottom left
 Darko_green_LOrd: okay thanks for the help
 eulerscheZahl: yes Schwase
 eulerscheZahl: i even wrote a solver long ago
 eulerscheZahl: for that one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=424">https://projecteuler.net/problem=424</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and i lost my code for that one&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: was probably garbage anyways. did that 7 years ago and improved since
 Schwase: i am planning on making a classic puzzle
 Schwase: i have spent way too much time absolutely plowing through dell cross sums magazines

 AntiSquid: regarding puzzles, what's up with people's obsession to add one annoying corner case to the puzzle that ruins a smooth straight up solution?
 AntiSquid: (one annoying validator that differs too much from the rest)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Edging">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Edging</a>
 sagya: hii
 AntiSquid: which of the 300+ variants of covid vaccines PatrickMcGinnisII? :Dand which strains does it cover? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: any specific puzzle with a corner case you are talking about AntiSquid?
 Shadowtick: hey i'm gonna start working on scrabble again :smiley:
 AntiSquid: can't remember right now, but there were plenty
 AntiSquid: just look at statements "solve this puzzle, but if this happens then output *special-string* instead"
 eulerscheZahl: yes, those are annoying
 eulerscheZahl: detect the invalid input
 eulerscheZahl: but i mostly see that in the CoC contributions (i sometimes have a look while they are still pending)
 eulerscheZahl: just make the main task interesting enough so you don't need that kind of extra "twist"
 JBM: hugs to you both
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 AntiSquid: i don't consent JBM
 JBM: now try and make our local #fr worst offender understand it
 AntiSquid: you're not grill enough for me
 eulerscheZahl: who's that fr offender?
 eulerscheZahl: and what' i'm wondering for quite some time: where's boulet?
 JBM: he's alive, he was on the (fr) chan earlier this week
 JBM: has been pretty lately, AFAIUI
 JBM: with a months-long "lately"
 eulerscheZahl: ah. glad he's fine
 JBM: that sentence is missing a "busy"
 JBM: pretty busy lately
 eulerscheZahl: afk, dinner time
 Shadowtick: how is everyone?
 jacek: good evening
 AntiSquid: shadowtick doesn't tab complete
 AntiSquid: was going to answer and share my feelings and secrets, but not anymore
 jacek: how dare he
 AntiSquid: exactly
 Shadowtick: I am new on here still so dont do this to me you could have said I dont wanna anwser
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did both the new easy puzzles, fairly proud of myself
 MadKnight: they're joking Shadowtick 
 Shadowtick: ok
 Shadowtick: I couldn't tell
 georgi-vasilev: hey all
 georgi-vasilev: im new to this community
 georgi-vasilev: nice to meet all of you
 Shadowtick: hello there its nice to meet you too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: got my CG fix, now to clean my house...omg, who tf has been squatting here?  have mercy
 Shadowtick: if you need help with one of the things I have done before and your using javascript georgi-vasilev let me know and I can help you
 georgi-vasilev: atm im using C#, but thank you! 
 Shadowtick: your welcome
 georgi-vasilev: I was using JS during the summer while i had intership but i found it hard tbh dunno why
 Shadowtick: plus I got used to using javascript
 Shadowtick: I have a website I have been using to get better with javascript/js
 georgi-vasilev: this website looks interesting tbh but i still dont get what to do sometimes and got stuck on some problems haha even though i believe i have some descent knowledge
 georgi-vasilev: do you use node.js for back-end or?
 Shadowtick: no I use p5.js
 georgi-vasilev: like .. some people tell me that nowadays django is getting in the way of js for backend
 Shadowtick: want me to send you the link?
 georgi-vasilev: ye why not
 The_Auditor: why Lisp is not available as a language choice&#160;?
 The_Auditor: why basic is not available as a language choice?
 jacek: no advance either
 Uljahn: there are clojure and vb.net instead
 jacek: nor delphi
 The_Auditor: isn't delphi pascal with IDE
 jacek: eeyup
 The_Auditor: vb.net is close to basic?
 jacek: its visual basic
 The_Auditor: then does the set of languages on you home page update based on the languages used in puzzlez?
 The_Auditor: *when
 pentom12: im really bad
 pentom12: please dont go hard on me
 Shadowtick: I can help you if you need help with javascript pentom12
 Shadowtick: so if you need help with that type of code I can help you
 jacek: oO
 Shadowtick: I got used to javascript
 Shadowtick: ok?
 jacek: fair enough
 pentom12: yes please 
 jacek: clash?
 pentom12: are you good?
 Shadowtick: I dont do clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: he will wipe the floor with you
 eulerscheZahl: show him jacek
 pentom12: im not saying im good man
 pentom12: why toxic
 jacek: exactly
 pentom12: come clash
 jacek: not so bad eh
 Shadowtick: no because if you seen my skills on p5.js you all would be done for because me on javascript is pretty good
 pentom12: im bad at problem solving
 Shadowtick: if it was p5.js you would be
 DomiKo: so you need to solve problems
 pentom12: i do websec mainly
 pentom12: a friend recommended me this
 Shadowtick: :3 I like doing code on here because it is fun so
 jacek: do you even clash
 Shadowtick: no I dont
 Shadowtick: because I am not into it
 jacek: alright
 pentom12: i prefer htb
 pentom12: different subject but its more realistic
 Perfect_DepiT: sex
 jacek: htb?
 Shadowtick: pls god don't talk about anything 18+ because I am not old enough to hear that stuff
 Perfect_DepiT: lol
 Shadowtick: I am just saying
 Perfect_DepiT: are you serious?
 Perfect_DepiT: every time?
 Perfect_DepiT: every moment?
 Perfect_DepiT: What the...
 Shadowtick: yes I am serious I am not 18+
 Perfect_DepiT: go to google translator and
 Perfect_DepiT: put into this
 Perfect_DepiT: 병신새끼
 Perfect_DepiT: G O T I T&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Perfect_DepiT: stop being rude please
 Perfect_DepiT: SO
 Perfect_DepiT: DONT STIMULATE ME
 Perfect_DepiT: IAMVERYANGRYOFYOU
 Astrobytes: Stop spamming the chat with crap please
 Perfect_DepiT: am i wrong?
 Perfect_DepiT: so my anger is wrong?
 eulerscheZahl: in the wording you are wrong for sure
 jacek: bloody hell
 Astrobytes: You are being disruptive as well as incoherent
 eulerscheZahl: didn't follow the chat to tell by how far you are off
 Perfect_DepiT: hahaha
 Perfect_DepiT: don't fuck with me
 Perfect_DepiT: okay?
 Shadowtick: imma probably  just delete my account at this point
 Perfect_DepiT: yeap
 Astrobytes: kickable offence Perfect_DepiT
 Perfect_DepiT: go to delete
 Astrobytes: Shadowtick: don't
 eulerscheZahl: did we find the reincarnation of struct?
 Perfect_DepiT: :grinning:
 Perfect_DepiT: Asshole
 Astrobytes: kicked
 Shadowtick: yep
 Shadowtick: I think so
 Astrobytes: Getting spammed with A**hole in repetition
 Astrobytes: in PM
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: go for ban next time&#160;;)
 Shadowtick: well I have to get off so bye everyone
 Astrobytes: bye
 eulerscheZahl: is a ban from public chat a valid reaction to bad behavior in PM?
 Astrobytes: Just warned him he's getting one euler
 Shadowtick: hope you have a great weekend
 Astrobytes: If he continues

 Astrobytes: dammit
 eulerscheZahl: is that some insults you wanted to share?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Astrobytes: cracked your page, more a**hole etc
 Astrobytes: nothing exciting
 eulerscheZahl: no polite "how are you" before the insult&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: No, they just skip straight to the insult with me 
 eulerscheZahl: changing the topic, sokoban is near to approval already
 eulerscheZahl: only 1 vote missing, faster than i expected
 Astrobytes: Just finished clearing my grandfather's house so should be back to being able to actually do stuff on CG next week
 AntiSquid: you could at least kick your arch-nemesis automatonNN
 eulerscheZahl: great
 Astrobytes: No-go on the multi sokoban then? :P
 eulerscheZahl: pushing penguins?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the replay from the code and we have a contest in the contest an
 AntiSquid: :D
 eulerscheZahl:  /kick AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and Automaton too
 Astrobytes: there's loads I need to catch up on tbh, not just penguins
 eulerscheZahl: same
 eulerscheZahl: but making that list even larger by adding own brain farts is more fun
 Astrobytes: then try and find time to learn the SDK well enough to port Morpion Solitaire
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK isn't even that hard to learn now
 eulerscheZahl: plenty of code + docs
 AntiSquid: where's mcsmitz and his bitboard implementation for all multis that come out?
 Astrobytes: Cool
 eulerscheZahl: the most important gotcha: don't redraw everything every turn. update existing sprites by changing the color, position, ...
 Astrobytes: Just moved in to new house AntiSquid, guess he's busy unpacking rn
 AntiSquid: turning his basement into a coding dungeon
 Astrobytes: That makes sense from what I've seen eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: or into a dungeon dungeon
 Astrobytes: :o
 eulerscheZahl: for his D&amp;D evenings
 Astrobytes: so glad you added that part

 MadKnight: just stop sucking and start solving beginnerpuzzles
 code_kevi: im in clash
 code_kevi: everyone won
 code_kevi: i suck
 code_kevi: help
 code_kevi: i need to find the biggest angle
 code_kevi: In a cyclic quadrilateral the sum of the two opposite angles are the same for both pair of angles.Given 4 angles (in any order), print the biggest angle of each pair, in descending order if they compose a cyclic quadrilateral, otherwise print "Angles Bad!!!". All angles are in degrees.

 code_kevi: helppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
 code_kevi: i did
 code_kevi: if a:
 code_kevi: and its wrong
 Astrobytes: Do what MadKnight said and start solving some easy puzzles
 Astrobytes: then clash later
 Astrobytes: No time limit on puzzles
 code_kevi: i cant sole ittt
 code_kevi: pls teach me
 code_kevi: i beg u
 jthemphill: you don't need to solve this puzzle now, you can solve other ones to get better
 code_kevi: :sob:
 code_kevi: i cant
 code_kevi: i suck
 Shvz: so easy puzzles is the way to start? I'd like to practice but clash is way too hard I feel 
 code_kevi: teach me
 code_kevi: im doing clash]
 code_kevi: and easy puzzlees
 code_kevi: but i cant
 Astrobytes: Shvz yep
 Shvz: thanks Astrobytes! 
 code_kevi: pls teach me
 code_kevi: im doing
 Astrobytes: you're welcome Shvz, there's puzzles in all difficulties, there's usually a forum thread if you get stuck, if not just ask about your issue in chat
 code_kevi:  a easy puzzle
 Shvz: oh I didn't know about the Forum, just landed here - I'll go head there now while doing some puzzle then&#160;:) 
 JFB: it is pascal
 code_kevi: hey 
 code_kevi: pls tell me
 code_kevi: how to do it
 code_kevi: teach me
 code_kevi: pls i beg u
 Astrobytes: There's also multiplayer bot programming, optimisation and codegolf in the Compete section Shvz, if you didn't know already. Enjoy&#160;:)
 code_kevi: are u a bot
 code_kevi: astrobytes
 MadKnight: code_kevi here's your first lesson:
 code_kevi: omg
 code_kevi: thanks for helping
 jthemphill: I'm working on PoW (escape the cat) and I feel like I'm running into a bunch of floating-point rounding errors. Did others wind up fudging things, or is there a principled way to handle this?
 MadKnight: u are not the center of the world code_kevi
 Astrobytes: Ye, me and MadKnight are both bots
 code_kevi: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 code_kevi: help
 jthemphill: like the cat's radius frequently comes out to 499 instead of 500
 Shvz: Nice will dig into that Astrobytes, so far the clash was way to stressful seeing everyone finishing, but defo fun, I just dont have the level yet I feel - will heads to the puzzle for now 
 MadKnight: u aren't even trying yourself code_kevi
 MichieldeBruyne: if you scream for help everytime you have a issue Code_kevi, you will not get anywhere in programming on the job
 Astrobytes: Take your time Shvz&#160;:)
 MadKnight: oh that's exactly what i was going to, MichieldeBruyne
 MadKnight: MichieldeBruyne, Michielde is your real name&#160;?
 Astrobytes: jthemphill: I've not done it unfortunately
 code_kevi: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Astrobytes: stop it code_kevi
 code_kevi: is the world full of bots
 JFB: jthemphill - all x, y are rounded to int so radius is not exactly 500
 MadKnight: yea we got 50k bots
 code_kevi: hello bot number 12451
 Sjogs: @MadKnight yeah woops. Changed it now to give myself some privacy xD. signed up through FB
 MadKnight: 45 in CSB
 Astrobytes: lol
 code_kevi: wait
 MadKnight: lol MichieldeBruyne
 code_kevi: i think u work
 code_kevi: that means
 code_kevi: ur expert
 MadKnight: yea
 code_kevi: teach me helper bot
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out for tonight. Later everyone
 MadKnight:  /teach
 MadKnight:  /teach code_kevi
 Sjogs: might take some time to go through it seems or I need to relaunch chat jikes
 Astrobytes: good to have you back MadKnight :P
 code_kevi: i did /teach
 MadKnight: error: there was no bot called "code_kevi"
 Shvz: thank again Astrobytes! 
 code_kevi: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Astrobytes: no problem at all Shvz
 code_kevi: what are u saying
 code_kevi: priv chat me
 MadKnight: u gotta be more specific code_kevi and stop freaking out lol
 Sjogs: code_kevi one valuable lesson. if you scream for help . nobody wants to help cause you are annoying people that way :P
 Sjogs: aaaaah soo much better to have a nickname instead of my real name
 Sjogs: lolol
 code_kevi: ok bye&#160;;(
 MadKnight: why bye?
 code_kevi: me annoying
 MadKnight: if they told u not to scream, u go away?
 code_kevi: me cant learn
 MadKnight: because u screaming instead of trying
 Sjogs: you can learn Kevi but you need to take the time to do so. google things . there is no 5 minute power session that makes you a programmer
 Sjogs: I mean I wish there was but welp. gotta wait for Tesla brain chips lol
 code_kevi: i took a 4 hour lesson#
 code_kevi: but i dont unnder stand what this says
 Sjogs: I've been programming for 5 years and I still am learning. so 4 hours is just the surface man
 Sjogs: if only my job was more programming snif snif
 code_kevi: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 code_kevi: be my teacher
 Sjogs: we've lost him Madknight
 code_kevi: what is your dis
 code_kevi: telll
 code_kevi: me 
 code_kevi: i need serious help
 MadKnight: stop screaming
 code_kevi: hello
 MadKnight: no more screaming
 MadKnight: at all
 code_kevi: how years old are u
 code_kevi: im 10
 MadKnight: ooooooooh
 MadKnight: then do scratch
 code_kevi: u have 5 years coding
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.scratchjr.org/">https://www.scratchjr.org/</a>
 MadKnight: go here
 code_kevi: oki
 Sjogs: kevi being 10 is not a reason to scream. start small if you are that young. 
 MadKnight: not a reason but a cause
 Sjogs: true
 code_kevi: im not 5 years old
 Sjogs: well back to learning python which is a big change from c#. rip my brackets snif
 code_kevi: im 10
 code_kevi: i learn python
 code_kevi: me gonna be python god
 MadKnight: screaming god&#160;?
 Sjogs: Kevi learn scratch and follow the link from MadKnight. start small and then go from there
 code_kevi: i was seeing the ascii art
 code_kevi: and it was

 MadKnight: yea i PMed him
 Tee-Resa: whats going on here:sweat_smile:
 Firesteels: Go to the forum somebody here recommended to you and ask some specific questions related to the task.
 Sjogs: too much tee-resa. :P
 MadKnight: Firesteels i told him to play scratch
 Shvz: Temperatures puzzle seems really hard, loops and array both which I didn't master really - I understand the logic of it but when Im on a white page and having to come out with it myself its really hard
 Shvz: at least hard for me as a beginer ( I forget to say ) 
 MadKnight: u don't need arrays
 MadKnight: u can go with it like descent
 Sjogs: I think I just cheated the system with mars lander episode 1. woops but it works GG :P
 MadKnight: check my php solution for ML1
 Sjogs: kalwyn's solution for that puzzle is just insane. my poor brain
 BkDevDude: sup guys
 Shvz: Hello Bk 
 Simonka: heya
 MadKnight: say hello, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yes, now i can go deeper
 MadKnight: saying hello isn't deeper, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i am running into a problem
 BkDevDude: i'm doing the power of thor thing, is there a variable for thor's current x and y position?
 MadKnight: nope
 BkDevDude: oh, apparently there's thor_y and thor_x
 MadKnight: no that's the initial ones
 MadKnight: his starting position
 MadKnight: the spawn
 BkDevDude: nope, that's initial_y and initial_x
 BkDevDude: actually initial_ty and initial_tx
 MadKnight: what code are u reading&#160;?
 MadKnight: show it to me
 Zenoscave: it doesn't show current position. only starting position of the hammer and thor iirc
 ThunderbirdOne: yup
 ThunderbirdOne: power of thor does not update thor coordinates
 Zenoscave: hey ThunderbirdOne
 Zenoscave: long time
 AntiSquid: are you aware of the upcoming unofficial contest?
 Zenoscave: nope
 Zenoscave: what is it?

 jthemphill: has anyone else seen the 'could not find `Cargo.toml` in `/tmp/project` or any parent directory' warnings in their JS console when working in Rust?
 MadKnight: js console?
 jthemphill: yeah, browser console
 jthemphill: open a puzzle in rust, inspect element, console
 MadKnight: that's probably rust assist
 MadKnight: or is that from the server&#160;?
 jthemphill: The message before the warning is "Starting language server for language rust" and the message after the warning is "Shutting down language server"
 jthemphill: I'm still able to run code and solve, so I assume it's a developer tool that's failing
 MadKnight: yea it is

 jrke: where is git repo for the same euler?
 Amogh.R: hmm yes i cant access it
 tkaetzel: no
 jrke: oh found the repo
 Amogh.R: is there any api
 tkaetzel: ok
 Amogh.R: its working now
 Amogh.R: thank you

 AntiSquid: morning
 indiehjaerta:  nmaps=  for else"s
 jacek: hm?
 Passifi: anyone knows whether you can save time by replacing iterators with standard for loops&#160;? 
 Passifi: by time I mean processing time&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: first you should let us know when programming language you use
 Passifi: oh sorry c++
 eulerscheZahl: probably not a big difference then. in doubt you should just measure it
 Passifi: kk thx
 Knee-Gears: hey euler!
 jacek: dont forget to use #pragma optims
 Passifi: just realized the problem gives me the number of elements so I now hope using arrays instead of vectors gives me enough speed boost&#160;:)
 jacek: what problem
 MSmits: hey jacek, I think you were right about the statistics. Needing a million of games before getting a good idea about what the best moves are
 MSmits: my initial guess was correct, but that seems lucky, in hindsight. It fluctuated a lot in between
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/123c1d14-cb27-47d3-9891-e4b575a0f4cf">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/123c1d14-cb27-47d3-9891-e4b575a0f4cf</a>
 MSmits: adding steal option was a good idea though
 MSmits: move 0 value has been dropping hard, these last day
 MSmits: this
 MSmits: in other games you dont need so many meta mcts games to figure this out. In Yavalath and uttt it's really obvious, but in connect 4 not so much
 legunen: are you a bot&#160;?
 jrke: MS whats your othello's algo?
 MSmits: jrke it's mcts with early play out evaluation. So kind of like a mcts with a minimax eval at the end. It's   about as strong as an average minimax bot. But some other bots are objectively stronger like jacek and dbdr because they trained their bots locally, producing much stronger eval
 MSmits: I'll pm you for details
 jrke: hmm 
 jacek: oh im 3rd in othello :c
 jacek: you'll post mortem him for details?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: I don't mind sharing how my bot works btw... but it's pretty basic
 MSmits: it's highly optimized, uses the basic mcts with no random rollout (EPT eval) and uses all the features commonly used in othello
 MSmits: thats about it
 jacek: and i bet avx
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: but no ntuples
 MSmits: that is obviously the way to go
 MSmits: I should learn how to properly do this one of these days
 MSmits: maybe next summer vacation
 MSmits: I need to finish my yavalath demo project
 MSmits: got the board working, but now i need to port the AI. More work than I thought because it needs to be C#
 MSmits: and I am not sure if i can use the same kind of code, which takes half a second to form all the lookup tables. This might be very slow in C#
 MSmits: and it will be compiled to webgl
 MSmits: oh and pdep/pex wont work i guess
 ArCjLord: how work on flutte here
 ArCjLord: who work on flutter here
 Megha.Akash: I have worked on Flutter ArCjLord

 VizGhar: I just looked around, and I don't want to hear more about that fetish
 SuperSpartan17: But it's sooooooo good.
 eulerscheZahl: VizGhar btw i had a short look at your Tsuro contribution
 VizGhar: uhm?
 jacek: oh boy
 eulerscheZahl: i think Metro would be a little more interesting (similar idea)
 eulerscheZahl: as you have multiple trains where you try to build long routes. not just 1
 eulerscheZahl: so the game lasts a little longer and is less random I think
 SuperSpartan17: &lt;3
 VizGhar: hmm I'll take a look. Not even sure whether I want Tsuro accepted as is.
 SuperSpartan17: Butterflies will drink your blood, sweat, and tears.
 eulerscheZahl: your comments are very random SuperSpartan17. are you a troll?
 jacek: AutomatonNN is he?
 AutomatonNN: hey guys i want to be fair i guess i will try to add a solution on github
 SuperSpartan17: I haven't been on coding game so long.
 SuperSpartan17: And last time I was on no one ever used the world chat
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it was long ago before world became the default

 reCurse: Sorry, daydreaming
 darkhorse64: std::chrono::year::is_leap for C++. I did not know that

 eulerscheZahl: or had before Freecell at least
 darkhorse64: Legend in all multis is the great achievement
 eulerscheZahl: and contests since Hypersonic (my first contest)
 darkhorse64: Yes, even better
 BlaiseEbuth: You're a newbie beside me... But I do nothing but trolling on the chat...  :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: the French jacek
 BlaiseEbuth: You're a frog btw
 reCurse: Still trying to breach legend in trolling&#160;:(
 philRG: trolling takes time and patience
 eulerscheZahl: if you do it too obvious, you'll just get banned
 reCurse: Refined trolling ofc
 eulerscheZahl: expert level trolling and you can achieve everything. even become president
 reCurse: That's not refined trolling...
 reCurse: That's bannable trolling
 eulerscheZahl: good point
 BlaiseEbuth: And if you're sneaky enough you become moderator...
 philRG: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: psst, don't tell them
 reCurse: Oh you mean the trollling was inside of me all this time??
 eulerscheZahl: :runner:
 BlaiseEbuth: unleash your inner troll

 <b>**philRG unleashes himself</b></p><p><img src="/a/29054906001010" /> Stilgart: freecell killed the 100% puzzle completion anyway
 eulerscheZahl: i refuse to even try it as long as there is an autoplay feature
 eulerscheZahl: did JBM even write a solver himself?
 Stilgart: Community success rate: 0%
 JBM: nope, not yet
 eulerscheZahl: then how do you know if the tests are solvable in 1s and the puzzle classifies as hard?
 Stilgart: I am more motivated by downloading the referee and exploiting what I may find than by solving the puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: wait, you didn't even write the constraints
 eulerscheZahl: "Try to win before reaching the turn or time limit."
 JBM: well obviously the approvers tested it, so it's all right
 JBM: that's what they're here fore, innit?
 eulerscheZahl: we all know how well the approval process works (space maze among my contributions)
 JBM: i place great trust in CG's decisions
 JBM: don't make me doubt now
 eulerscheZahl: :rolling_eyes:
 BlaiseEbuth: Give that man a moderator badge&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: the CG community, a fountain of wisdom
 philRG: don't make jpm doubt, that's the rule&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: ok, then i'll just wait for him to solve Freecell
 JBM: i thought you were waiting for manualplay
 eulerscheZahl: that too
 Stilgart: are forks forbidden now&#160;?
 JBM: so not really "just" :D
 eulerscheZahl: usually the creator is supposed to have a working solution when posting a puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: they forgot that requirement for SDK contributions
 JBM: who reads those checkboxes anyway
 JBM: (cf approvers)
 JBM: I mean I could have let it in WIP
 JBM: but then you'd have complained I'm raking XP
 JBM: you're almost french by now
 reCurse: Ah so that's what it is
 eulerscheZahl: the solution is so simple: write a solver&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: then you would see that autoplay is annoying
 JBM: oh i believe you
 JBM: it's still in my todo, i'm not forgetting it
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:+1:
 JBM: after the truly important features of adjusting the icon to match the cards, and the klondike-style game ending
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 JBM: about solvability: I'm only issuing one of the 32k "Win95" games
 JBM: so you may  probably just compress the solution DB

 RyanGilbert: is that something u earn or do u have to apply
 eulerscheZahl: clash contributions: play 50 clashes
 eulerscheZahl: any other type of contribution: reach level 20
 eulerscheZahl: only public clashes count for those 50, no private ones
 RyanGilbert: ok thanks
 philRG: +25Xp for my first contribution of CoC thks EulerscheZahl&#160;:-)
 philRG: +50xp for moderation
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know what I should ask first here
 eulerscheZahl: why only 25XP and not 250?why thanks me?
 eulerscheZahl: and why don't you use tab completion to write my name?
 BlaiseEbuth: Cause a coc contrib must not give more than 25xp.Cause you're the one.Cause he don't know that this feature exist.

 eulerscheZahl: i installed it to create the onitama logo
 VizGhar: :D :D :D How'd you fixed it last time? cant remember
 Salted: I remember writing pranky programs like programs to do that kinda stuff. That's so funny!
 eulerscheZahl: full reinstall of my browser
 VizGhar: uninstall font reinstall browser :D
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i don't think i'll need that font even again. so just dumping it sounds like a plan
 eulerscheZahl: and continue until only 1 is left if it happens again
 VizGhar: chrome gor font settings
 VizGhar: has
 Salted: Just embrace it and learn to love that font. I mean that's how I learned to like coffee. 
 eulerscheZahl: i tried those font settings, had no effect for me
 BlaiseEbuth: Keep comic san ms if you do that.
 eulerscheZahl: i still hate coffee
 VizGhar: Or go study medicine&#160;:) you might find that font appealing later on
 Salted: What's your go to alternative to coffee?
 eulerscheZahl: sleep
 Sakshi_Jain: green tea for low caffeine mode and energy drink for high caffeine mode
 VizGhar: white tea or sleep for me. I'm allergic to coffee 
 Sakshi_Jain: Ooo I recently started with white tea, it's pretty good
 Sakshi_Jain: have you tried red tea btw?
 VizGhar: Best approach is. "I need some sleep, so I get some sleep"
 VizGhar: red? :O
 Sakshi_Jain: yess
 Sakshi_Jain: its called rooibos
 Sakshi_Jain: I have a caffeine free one
 Sakshi_Jain: it has an interesting earthy scent and taste
 Sakshi_Jain: quite similar to silver tips white tea
 Sakshi_Jain: but stronger
 Sivasuriyan: u can try beer.
 VizGhar: ah rooibos? drank it but didn't like aroma... maybe not pure rooibos tho
 Sivasuriyan: even u can try briani
 Sakshi_Jain: ohh
 eulerscheZahl: uninstalling the font worked&#160;:)
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: I told you uninstalling the font worked for me when I had my browser-font issue

 Sakshi_Jain: any tips?
 eulerscheZahl: but uninstalling the browser was faster to test and seemed to work at first
 eulerscheZahl: is that just you vs the problem? or live coding with someone watching?
 Sakshi_Jain: well it's a proctored coding assessment with 3 problems of varrying difficulties
 Sakshi_Jain: My performance will be compared with that of other contestants 
 eulerscheZahl: stay calm, read the task completely and try not to make any assumptions while skipping a few lines
 Sakshi_Jain: ahh, I'll really have to keep that in mind
 eulerscheZahl: try to think about corner cases (like integer overflow, division by 0)
 Sakshi_Jain: I tend to make that mistake a lot

 DomiKo: and you have 6 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: the easiest is the hacktoberfest of course
 DomiKo: to upload file with output

 Astrobytes: For the Spring Challenge? Sure.
 Salted: Reaching the top 2% of optimization puzzles for the quest map is a monumental task. 
 GriM: So i've found this site is great for practice, but how did you guys actually LEARN?
 GriM: Just start the challenge, and then research until you can solve?
 jacek: you need at least some basics
 jacek: but yes, start puzzle, read on what puzzle requires and google the things you dont know
 Astrobytes: ^ 100% this
 Salted: After really struggling through a puzzle, I learn by looking at other people's code after I complete a puzzles. It's especially helpful when learning a new language. 
 jacek: a mod agrees, so its true
 GriM: I know some. Basic syntax etc.
 Westicles: what is this google you speak of?
 Westicles: nvm, i looked it up on altavista
 jacek: or banged it
 Velicko: hi guys, i was playing code vs zombies few days ago and window with animation just disappeared. I now  tried again, and still there is no animation... When i play test, i see that it has passed and became green, but there are also no logs and console output window is empty...

 jacek: struct make some clash
 Westicles: well, you'd have to replace the dice rolling with something else.
 jacek: whats wrong with dice rolling
 struct: jace k the game is only dice rolling
 struct: nothing else
 jacek: just like war card game? no strategy, only random

 ZzzTRAPzzZ: clash of code scoring is rlly unfair
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: it was shortest code, so I made my solution as short as possible in python 3
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: this is what I got:
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: print(sum(c=="1" for c in bin(int(input()))[2:])%2==1)
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: and the expected answer was "true" or "false"
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: and even though I solved the problem perfectly it gave me 0%
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: while in languages like java "true" is automatically lowercase
 ZzzTRAPzzZ: when it scores shouldn't it not account for the string that's give if it's true/false but the boolean?
 Westicles: ZzzTRAPzzZ, I suggest we plan some kind of sit-in for protest

 LinhT.Nguyen: it's numpy!!
 Allis: For transpose?
 LinhT.Nguyen: yeah
 LinhT.Nguyen: but i think i found something
 LinhT.Nguyen: else
 LinhT.Nguyen: fck my brain alright xD
 Allis: @LinhT.Nguyen Here ya go: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/IPpiJg">https://ideone.com/IPpiJg</a>
 jdsfklsd: braed
 jdsfklsd: bread
 jdsfklsd: brioche
 Allis: Having  to explicitly say list() everywhere is annoying, but being able to transpose just by zipping the splat is very nice.
 BiMathAx: Hello, i tonna to do thé puzzle happy number but i don’t understabd Thais&#160;: «&#160;of irse digits ion base-ten&#160;»... What is this, please 
 eulerscheZahl: «of its digits in base-ten»that's what the statement says
 riccoraga: @MathieuGanesan
 jacek: oO
 jacek: meh, checkers is so drawish in the top
 MSmits: yeah, especially because of loops
 MSmits: endgame books would fix this, but they are really big in checkers. 3-4 pieces is the best you can do 
 MSmits: mostly because you need a DTM as opposed to WLD endgame base. You need the time to win instead of the W/L/D value. If you know the time to win of a state, you can end the game as fast as possible
 MSmits: time to win is at least 8 bit as opposed to WLD, which is 3 bit
 MSmits: err less than 2 bit even
 jacek: mmh
 MSmits: you can generate it on the fly in some way, but you need a very efficient algo. But then at least space wont matter much
 MSmits: i do it on the fly in oware. Last night I  boosted the performance to being able to do 8 seeds in 300 ms&#160;:)
 MSmits: my original was 6 seeds and also took 300 ms, now 20 ms. Crazy boost
 jacek: at first turn?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: and how does it affect winrate
 MSmits: a little, it's really really hard to tell because there is a huge gap between the 4 NN's and the number 5
 jacek: at least self winrate
 MSmits: hmm I should test that. I will have to submit without both books, then do a CG bench with 8 seed endgame book
 jacek: so you dont have some local arena? you do it all via cgbench? :O
 MSmits: I do I think, I havent used it in a year o rmore
 MSmits: i generally dont run more than 5-10 games or so, i just need to find one i lose to create the opening book with
 MSmits: and I lose a lot vs you
 MSmits: the sad thing is, my 9 seed takes about 1200 ms =/
 MSmits: i can calculate it over the next few turns i think, but that's so messy
 jacek: until you find a more efficient algo
 MSmits: this is pretty efficient though. This one is able to create a db roughly 14 million states with their end game seed count
 MSmits: 75582 different states * 185 turns (because turn matters)
 MSmits: thats in 300 ms. So it could do 50 million in the full 1s
 MSmits: my local DB goes up to 15 seeds in an hour, with this boost I could make it go much faster, but 16 seeds will still take 100 times longer because 15 seed db fits exactly in 4 GB memory, I would have to use  harddrive memory&#160;:(
 jacek: 4GB RAM? what year is it
 MSmits: its not the ram limitation
 MSmits: the arrays required cant be bigger than some value
 MSmits: the compilers just wont let you
 jacek: C# limitation?
 MSmits: c++
 MSmits: in VS anyway
 jacek: w00t
 MSmits: I could get up to 22 seeds with 100 GB HD the way i am storing it now
 MSmits: more seeds is nice, because you can local sim and end with a lookup at 22 as opposed to simming till 15
 MSmits: it's faster, but also more accurate
 MSmits: I think this perfectly reflects my winrate vs the NN's now:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits</a>
 MSmits: recurse's last submit was always very strong vs my bot and you and robo submitted a very strong bot at the end. I was 0-10% vs them without my opening book. Agade was always 55%
 jacek: better than agade, neat
 jacek: huh, robo so down, he was 2nd
 MSmits: i did a lot of submits
 MSmits: and i have an opening book vs you and robo, not so much vs recurse and agade
 MSmits: he can resubmit and get back up
 MSmits: preferably a few times, so i get boosted to 3rd :p
 MSmits: btw, I thought your bot was very deterministic, but that random chance does produce some offshoots in the tree. On average one split every 5-10 plies
 MSmits: robo's has one split in the full opening book tree. Almost completely deterministic
 MSmits: it's a smart move
 MSmits: noticed this in Othello as well
 MSmits: must be difficult to balance this. If you make the random thingy too large, your bot gets worse
 jacek: my UCT is [0.9,1.1] * eval + exploration
 MSmits: ahh yes, that's what i would have expected
 jacek: so it isnt completely deterministic even with fixed rollouts
 MSmits: it only changes stuff around when several moves are nearly equally good
 jacek: its good for testing the strength, because either it would be 100% or 0%
 jacek: and against boomers
 jacek: bookers*
 jacek: :D
 MSmits: yea, it does help a lot
 MSmits: i wonder if this would help me fit parameters by self play
 MSmits: i could even create an opening book while using it at the same time 
 MSmits: btw i checked earlier and the book only has 707 moves in it still and that includes the opponents moves i dont play, just to build the tree. That's after months of calctime
 MSmits: so you can see why i havent needed that unicode thing before
 Allis: Months?!
 MSmits: well yeah, i have it running in the background on a single core
 MSmits: Games played: 2546303 
 MSmits: a game takes 1-3 seconds
 MSmits: every game adds a node to the tree
 jacek: yeah, only months
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I've done this for yavalath, uttt and othello as well
 MSmits: for uttt with little success except vs other people that use books
 AntiSquid: how come you didn't have your own NN attempt yet MSmits?
 jacek: he has - its book
 AntiSquid: that's different
 jacek: only cool kids have NN
 AntiSquid: only the top NNs are cool :P
 jacek: AutomatonNN is it true?
 AutomatonNN: I come to the beach and sure&#160;:)
 YurkovAS: jacek do you have open book in uttt?
 jacek: no. only teccles'
 AntiSquid: are we going to see some nasty bail-ins AutomatonNN&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: yeah
 JefMacatugob: hi
 Q12: Why sometime I have this message:"Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."and after I click run test case again (the same test case), without changing a thing, it disappear.Do you know why this is happening?
 eulerscheZahl: that's because of the goblin living on one of the CG servers
 MSmits: I'm pretty sure it's a toad
 LastRick: Like most warnings, I just ignore it. I'm sure that's fine.
 A.F: hi
 A.F: how to do coders strike back
 A.F: :grin:
 jacek:&#160;?
 jacek: the more you know <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheskers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheskers</a>
 Robin: Hey guys, sorry to disturb. Just a question. Do you know the recursion limit of the CodinGame evaluator?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>the defaults of your language
 jacek: what is the defaults of french?
 eulerscheZahl: numbers go up to 60. then you have to use math
 Robin: Thanks for that. But it's doesn't answer my question unfortunately.. It says how much memory is available. Not how big the call stack can be..
 eulerscheZahl: it gives a a list of compiler versions used
 eulerscheZahl: consult the docs for that specific language and version
 jacek: medical docs?
 Robin: Not trivial. It depends on how much memory has been allocated to the stack. With java it can be done with the -Xss flag.
 Robin: Anyway, I'll never know..
 jacek: so make some experiments
 Robin: By doing a simple infinite recursion, I can go to over 10000 calls before it crashes.
 Robin: With my program, it fails with fewer than 5000.
 Robin: Screw this, I don't want to remove the recursion...
 besirgunduz: hello guys
 jacek: ohai
 FuriousT: I assume you've accounted for any parameters passed in your recursion experiment + locals of the function you are recursing. 
 jacek: damm you recursion <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/493782102">https://www.codingame.com/replay/493782102</a>
 MSmits: bug in your sim jacek?
 MSmits: I know your pain, it's hard
 MSmits: are you doing it on a bitboard?
 jacek: i copied some bitboard implementation in python to c++
 jacek: i think the sim is good but translating move to this notation is bugged
 MSmits: ah yeah, thats annoying as well
 MSmits: it's different for different games too I think
 MSmits: sometimes the top is 1, sometimes bottom
 MSmits: yay, seed 9 book finished calculating on ply 10
 MSmits: so that should work in most games unless my opponent plays ridiculous moves that aren't in the opening book
 MSmits: wonder if it's worth doing a 10 seed one
 MSmits: probably finish at ply 70 or something :P
 jacek: so you pick book move and calculate the endgame in rest of the turn?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: x.x
 MSmits: first time i do something crazy like that
 kaanersoy12: Guys hi, how can i get hint about game i am a new i want to learn
 Emreunsal: mal aq
 MSmits: which game?
 kaanersoy12: The Descent
 jacek: there are some hints for puzzles.
 jacek: on the left
 MSmits: yeah there's a thingy you can click
 kaanersoy12: there is mountains so scary&#160;:/
 MSmits: the descent is mostly about going through the loop and outputting the highest one
 MSmits: it looks a bit weird because you're already in a loop, but this is the game loop
 MSmits: you have to write your own loop where you pick the highest mountain
 MSmits: and output this
 kaanersoy12: Okey i can understand it is a good one&#160;:) 
 kaanersoy12: thanks.
 kaanersoy12: a lot
 MSmits: np
 Astrobytes: up to 9 seeds for your book now MSmits? Impressive!
 Emreunsal: mal aq
 kaanersoy12: How can i get the heighest mountain value?
 Emreunsal: :heart_eyes:
 kaanersoy12: i can't do it till 30 minutes lol&#160;:)
 kaanersoy12: i can't do it
 kaanersoy12: How can i get the highest mountain value in The Descent game&#160;? please help
 Emreunsal: help help
 Emreunsal: heeeeeeelp
 Emreunsal: HEEEEEELP
 Emreunsal:&#160;!!!
 jacek: :thinking:
 Emreunsal: List&lt;Checkpoint&gt; checkpoints = new List&lt;Checkpoint&gt;();
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah, still ironing out some bugs, but 9 seeds seems to be doable. Maybe 10 seeds too but probably not realistic
 jacek: you gotta pump those numbers up
 jacek: up to 48
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and add a 20 before
 jacek: then maybe youll have chance
 MSmits: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: promoting stuff like jacek does with paper soccer :P
 MSmits: main limit is cache efficiency. You need to do a lot of lookups during the generation of the db. Once the db gets to 30 million entries...
 MSmits: no way around that really
 MSmits: i did some profiling and 70% of the calc time was just getting a value out of the db and it's a plain array lookup, cant be made faster
 Astrobytes: oof
 MSmits: i just tried to code a progress indicator for the seed9 book and multiplied the steps done by 100 and divide by the total steps. There are so many steps that I got a negative percentage... went out of 32 bit range :P
 AntiSquid: paper soccer is not real football, change my mind
 eulerscheZahl: and chess is no sport
 eulerscheZahl: neither is e-sport
 jacek: paper soccer was once puzzle of the week... during contest...&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: bad timing
 MSmits: that's just mean
 eulerscheZahl: onitama gained 100 players in that 1 weekand dots and boxes even more
 AntiSquid: sorry for you man, it's like winning lottery when there's a huge&#160;% tax on it :P
 MSmits: I don't dislike paper soccer really. I just always seem to have 2 or 3 games that rank higher for me. 
 jacek: 258 on d&amp;b, when there was less than 50 week before
 jacek: just like coronavirus cases
 jacek: i would have thought more people played it at school. but its apparently only popular in poland and mid/eastern europe
 MSmits: yeah i didnt play it at school, only D&amp;B I think
 eulerscheZahl: i did neither
 eulerscheZahl: only four in a row (rarely)
 jacek: euler had no chill at school
 AntiSquid: i played d&amp;b in school was #1, beat the guy who was addicted to it, totally meaningless achievement, but since we are on the topic ...
 MSmits: that's cool AntiSquid
 MSmits: I bet he still visits the psych talking about you
 jacek: and yet youre at the bottom of leaderboard
 jacek: plot twist: that was Crazy_Remi
 AntiSquid: i put 0 time into it

 MSmits: why?, did you stub your toe and looking to move here?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: loool
 jacek: maybe
 Astrobytes: Does a back/bone problem qualify as a disability? Asking for a friend... :P
 jacek: first weed and now this?
 jacek: how can you get even cooler than that?
 Astrobytes: Apartments without heating
 AntiSquid: physics professors skipping class @jacek
 AntiSquid: and python was born there
 MSmits: I dunno, the coolness must be focused in a different part of my country, Not feelin it here
 eulerscheZahl: was a discussion here as well <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/sex/sexualbegleitung-fuer-behinderte-umsetzung-von-grundrecht-oder-prostitution-a-1129343.html">https://www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/sex/sexualbegleitung-fuer-behinderte-umsetzung-von-grundrecht-oder-prostitution-a-1129343.html</a>
 Astrobytes: "Some sex care workers admitted to being ‘sneaked’ into the house of their clients, especially through their backdoors"
 eulerscheZahl: check the last paragraph, even mentions the Netherlands as an example
 eulerscheZahl: (sorry for German)
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: I was honestly just surprised about the government funding part
 MSmits: not sure that is true, seems unlikely
 eulerscheZahl: google time? have fun clearing your history afterwards :D
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: good tip
 Astrobytes: Not sure it is govt funded from what I've read
 Astrobytes: But it's regarded as acceptable
 jacek: its nothing. in here government f**k us everytime
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Astrobytes: would be funnier if it wasn't true
 AntiSquid: why does this give an error on CG: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d379c6b-b52e-4849-bbb5-471dc05f90d1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0d379c6b-b52e-4849-bbb5-471dc05f90d1</a>
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl says it's the goblin
 AntiSquid: struct move {  }; vector&lt;move&gt; moves;  // gives error
 AntiSquid: struct Move {  }; vector&lt;Move&gt; moves; // works
 Astrobytes: the move keyword?
 Astrobytes: std::move?

 jacek: AutomatonNN where is struct?
 AntiSquid: oh i forgot it exists
 AutomatonNN: why?
 jacek: AutomatonNN because his gone and he didn't delete account yet
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code royale bot to start with your submit to stay in the lea
 eulerscheZahl: and that's why you don'tusing namespace std
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: LOL
 Astrobytes: no mercy for the Automaton
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonNN will be back i fear
 eulerscheZahl: takes longer than i thought
 jacek: huh
 Astrobytes: he kicked NN
 eulerscheZahl: nothing to see here
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN was just peacefully protesting
 Astrobytes: doesn't he come back after chat reset or something
 Astrobytes: Or does he need a restart himself, I don't remember
 jacek: Automaton2000 why that frog kicked your brother?
 Automaton2000: i see no way to know if my bot is so stupid
 eulerscheZahl: we'll find out. i wouldn't be surprised to see it back tomorrow
 Astrobytes: better not ban it I guess :P
 Scarfield: i think it comes back with chat reset, undyingmaton
 AntiSquid: make a chat bot that pings its creator
 Astrobytes: Autoscarf o/
 Scarfield: autoBytes oi
 AntiSquid: zombie chatbot
 eulerscheZahl: Autohotkey
 Astrobytes: Zombitron9000
 Scarfield: make a bot that kicks NN
 Astrobytes: Or an NN that kicks bots :thinking:
 AntiSquid: he'd have to use his account
 eulerscheZahl: give a bot mod rights. and you have a 1% chance to get kicked when you ping it
 Astrobytes: hah
 eulerscheZahl: oh, astro was faster with that suggestion :o
 eulerscheZahl: i've gotten slow
 AntiSquid: he also golfed it
 jacek: youre getting old
 Astrobytes: what multi you working on AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: idk&#160;?
 AntiSquid: why?
 Astrobytes: Just wondering, since you posted about the move/Move thing
 AntiSquid: i opened up ice and fire earlier then went to read a book i downloaded
 AntiSquid: then came back and fooling around with dots and boxes
 AntiSquid: look my rank improved there
 Astrobytes: Ah. I gave up doing anything on ice and fire, tried some stuff for low hanging fruit but I need a rewrite so I gave up
 Astrobytes: Just did my first d&amp;b the other day, not written a proper one yet, just enough to get into next league
 AntiSquid: didn't do anything on CG for really long 
 Astrobytes: Same
 AntiSquid: trying to avoid a slow start next contest :P
 Astrobytes: lol also same 
 AntiSquid: i should probably look at referee . i am like the "what does the statement say" people in chat when it comes to the referee code
 Astrobytes: No need for getting out of wood 2
 AntiSquid: no but then i might have to rewrite the structure
 Astrobytes: I don't get serious until next league unless it's necessary
 AntiSquid: doing this very halfhearted . 
 Astrobytes: Just sort the available moves by something, prefer certain moves if available, if not use the sorted
 Astrobytes: boxes, not moves 
 Astrobytes: you'll figure it out
 AntiSquid: i am writing it, i am just slow
 AntiSquid: not import libs here
 Astrobytes: import libs?
 AntiSquid: import kerasadd layeradd layer
 Astrobytes: Not using python here either
 Astrobytes: Type faster
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: wait, you're distracting me
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 tell him i need to be polite and answer
 Automaton2000: thanks for all the other stuff
 Astrobytes: haha, well shut up and code then! 
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 starting pinging this guy
 Automaton2000: i've got the same problem
 AntiSquid: let's wait for him outside when he takes the bins out Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i am in the train
 AntiSquid: you're done for, automaton is on his way Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: (and I'm the distracting one :rolling_eyes: )
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: i think this promotes me
 Astrobytes: looks that way yep
 AntiSquid: what's the best structure to store the board? any theories&#160;? :p
 eulerscheZahl: class Board
 Astrobytes: didn't get that far yet, first thought was a graph (edges, vertices style)
 AntiSquid: i think next contest will be about hunting toads and dropping them in the witches' cauldron
 AntiSquid: ok bad joke, killed chat, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i'll do it in time
 Astrobytes: coding killed my chat, not your joke
 FuriousT: what does this mean "angle for the rotation angle in degrees" for the input? 
 vatsalsharma376: I have some fair experience in competitive programming but I don't know how to start with codingame. Are there any good #resources&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Depends on your experience really, there's puzzles, multiplayer bot programming, optimistation, code golf
 Astrobytes: *optimisation
 magaiti: FuriousT, angle is the variable name, "rotation angle in degrees" is the variable value
 magaiti: or rather, variable meaning
 magaiti: meaning of the variable value. duh
 AntiSquid: don't like the referee implementation for the board on d&amp;b, thinking of how to do a nicer one
 AntiSquid: maybe a checkerboard of sorts .
 MSmits: AntiSquid do you mean for a sim in your not?
 MSmits: bot
 MSmits: I can share my board implementation, but not sure you'll like it :P
 AntiSquid: for my bot . i only use one representation usually
 MSmits: ah ok
 AntiSquid: and i think i can do with 1 here
 MSmits: well mine is uint64_t hor and uint64_t ver
 AntiSquid: A1 R == B1 L is part of what i want to add into the way i access the edges
 MSmits: ah I see
 AntiSquid: what does that mean MSmits
 MSmits: I just have all horizontal lines in one bitboard and all vertical lines in another bitboard
 MSmits: both are 64 bit
 AntiSquid: oh i get it .
 Astrobytes: but what about box edges
 MSmits: i didn't know what kind of search i was gonna do so i figured if it is mcts i could keep the board on the node
 MSmits: well they are just lines also
 MSmits: first vertical line on the left is bit 1
 AntiSquid: so you have 2 boards per node&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: mind you i never got a search for wood 2. I used this method in my local solver
 MSmits: I randomly create endgame boards by placing lines on it until all lines lead to boxes given away
 MSmits: wood 1 i mean
 MSmits: I did have a whole mcts thing in wood 2
 MSmits: including the bitboards... but kinda overkill with that small a board
 Astrobytes: I just sorted the boxes and edges by a heuristic lol
 MSmits: oh, I solved the whole thing on turn 1 and then my bot just gave up when it was p2 
 Astrobytes: fk effort for wood 2
 MSmits: because 3 -1 
 MSmits: I'll go back to D&amp;B once I get this AI course done, will be in 2 months o rso
 Astrobytes: how's it going? 
 MSmits: got too distracted by other games. Glad I am done with oware now though, no more seeds. 9 is the limit
 AntiSquid: well my board would have 225 places once i implement it, only 112 used though
 Astrobytes: lol, not tempted with 10 then
 MSmits: going ok, did not get that much done in my vacation week, but got some good videos and animations ready to put in there
 Astrobytes: awesome, did you end up using the interactive one?
 MSmits: well after all the bugs were fixed, seed 9 DB is done between ply 15-40, 10 db would take twice as long and cause cache issues for the rest of the bot
 MSmits: yeah i did
 MSmits: i put it as an i-frame 
 AntiSquid: wait i could use uint128_t is that slower than 2 uint64_t&#160;?
 MSmits: had to dust of some archaic html skills
 Astrobytes: Ah, yeah given your access time for the db that figures lol
 Astrobytes: ah cool
 MSmits: AntiSquid that depends on how you use it, if you're gonna access the 64 bit thingies separately all the time then it might cause overhead to do the 128 bit version
 MSmits: I used the 128 bit for hypersonic because it made sense there
 MSmits: visual studio hates it though
 Astrobytes: that's why I never used 128 bit tbh
 DomiKo: omg so close to top20 in UTTT
 MSmits: gj DomiKo, you did teccles already right?
 DomiKo: yes yes
 DomiKo: i can't improve performance
 MSmits: penalty on selection for moves that give away a free move to opponent?
 FuriousT: magaiti . no doubt.  However, what I meant is which angle.  In any case it matters not as the angle is non-sensical until you actually start moving.  My issue was with the angle reading initially.
 DomiKo: but I'm tuning some parameters
 DomiKo: and testing how some "enchacements" work
 MSmits: what enhancements are those? Or is this a trade secret?
 Astrobytes: enchantments or enhancements? If you're using magic I wanna know :P
 MSmits: I have maybe 2 things I never shared, but most of what i do is common knowledge
 magaiti: FuriousT, initially your angle is -1 which means it is not defined. you can start moving in any direction
 Astrobytes: (just playing on the spelling mistake&#160;:) )
 MSmits: yeah it was almost enchantments
 magaiti: after that, your pod has a defined arientation
 DomiKo: at some point, I don't know what I'm doing
 DomiKo: so I can say it could be magic
 MSmits: this is mcts though?
 DomiKo: yes
 MSmits: ah ok
 Nerchio: MSmits already knows everythhing about MCTS boring :D
 DomiKo: i have to say that I did like 100+ submits
 MSmits: I am never bored talking about mcts&#160;:)
 MSmits: oo did my rank change
 DomiKo: and leaderboard in top 11-30 changed a lot
 AntiSquid: MCsmiTS
 DomiKo: that because amur and Yurkov submited a lot too
 Astrobytes: MCTS Bitboards is actually MSmits' name
 DomiKo: I moved some guys fromtop11 to top25
 DomiKo: some from top30 to to18
 MSmits: nice work DomiKo
 MSmits: wow amurushkin must have improved his bot a lot
 MSmits: well at least a little
 AntiSquid: you shuffled the leaderboard . 
 AntiSquid: if there were continuous games it would readjust itself :P
 MSmits: i have to be careful... uttt has some serious power... I get drawn back in :P
 Astrobytes: what's the hot multi in #ru these days? I haven't checked for a while
 DomiKo: that's my job
 DomiKo: shuffling is my second name
 MSmits: good luck finding a wife with that
 Astrobytes: Mrs Shuffling
 DomiKo: :rolling_eyes:
 AntiSquid: was a reply to your "moved people in ranks", RPS effect there for sure imo
 Astrobytes: Nerchio, how's COIF legend?
 AntiSquid: CIF
 Astrobytes: that's a cleaning product
 AntiSquid: then CIAF
 Nerchio: I left it already :D
 Astrobytes: CoIaF is what it should be
 Nerchio: trying to learn some MCTS in UTTT now
 Astrobytes: ah cool
 Nerchio: cause last time i tried it was a disaster
 MSmits: yeah, that was my first mcts
 AntiSquid: i said it from the start i am calling it CIF
 MSmits: it's hard to get it right the first time
 DomiKo: yes
 AntiSquid: what's the best node selection formula&#160;?
 MSmits: do you just mean the selection part of mcts?
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: lemme share mine for oware, they are all similar
 Astrobytes: depends on the application, there are variants on plain UCT
 AntiSquid: UCB
 DomiKo: you can try SHOT
 Astrobytes: applied to trees
 Astrobytes: UCT
 Astrobytes: or SHAT
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/yK08Xa1y">https://pastebin.com/yK08Xa1y</a>
 MSmits: oh did you mean the uct formula
 MSmits: I just use plain uct with a fitted exploration usually

 MSmits: this is for a single child node. I pass the statistics of the parent as a parameter
 MSmits: invsqrt(x) = 1/sqrt(x)
 MSmits: takes a bit of math to work it out, but it's just the normal ucb 
 MSmits: this is optimized
 Astrobytes: and works nicely
 MSmits: inline float rsqrt_fast(float x) { return _mm_cvtss_f32(_mm_rsqrt_ss(_mm_set_ss(x))); }
 MSmits: use that
 AntiSquid: is shat latest trend or what Astrobytes
 MSmits: people been :poop: ing since the dawn of history AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ah that thing Jacek linked in chat yesterday?
 Astrobytes: Sequential Halving Applied to Trees
 Astrobytes: yea
 Astrobytes: h
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: lemme check that out
 Astrobytes: I wasn't satisfied with "We propose to adapt Sequential Halving toMonte Carlo Tree Search and to name the resultingalgorithm SHOT"

 AntiSquid: i have it . added it to my google drive for later :P
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: using google drive so i don't have to move pdf from device to device
 AntiSquid: then i can read when i am bored
 Astrobytes: yep, sensible
 AntiSquid: cool MSmits, do you always use the same formula?
 MSmits: lately yeah, I have experimented with different ones on uttt a long time ago
 MSmits: never got noticable results, but I have to admit i didnt do it very scientifically
 Astrobytes: there's a whole bunch of variations on it
 Astrobytes: some require mods to the actual algo
 Astrobytes: Can't say I've experimented much
 MSmits: the one i like is where you do an evaluation of the children and store that and during selection you prefer this eval on low visits and the statistics become more important than the eval as you visit the node more
 MSmits: kind of a mix between minimax and mcts i suppose
 MSmits: you just have to tune it right
 jacek: progressive bias?
 Astrobytes: that's a nice one
 MSmits: that could be it yeah, i forgot the name
 jacek: just use jacekmax and enjoy being 1st in every game
 Astrobytes: "you just have to tune it right" goes without saying for any eval function :P
 MSmits: i mean the balance between statistics and eval, on top of tuning the actual eval
 MSmits: what was jacekmax again?
 jacek: hyperparameter tuning eh
 jacek: best-first minimax with uct
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: sounds good
 Astrobytes: there's material on it, jacek probably has the paper links
 jacek: linked here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 MSmits: is this shat or shot thing usable for fixed time limits?
 MSmits: oh great
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, forgot you did that playground
 MSmits: thanks jacek
 jacek: they claim shot is slightly better than uct with the same time
 MSmits: oh btw, I thought i was the only one that use depth 0 ept jacek&#160;?
 MSmits: or did someone else also do 0?
 Astrobytes: Me
 jacek: zerobytes
 MSmits: oh and it was bette rfor you too?
 Astrobytes: yep
 MSmits: ah cool
 Astrobytes: I told you to try 0 depth
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: I talk too much about stuff, forget who told me what
 Astrobytes: you're just better than me is all
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: you also told me about the custom hash
 Astrobytes: yep
 MSmits: I should remember better what you say
 Astrobytes: As long as I'm around to remind you don't worry :P
 MSmits: kk&#160;:)
 jacek: kkk even
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 MSmits: does jacekmax come with a solver?
 MSmits: oh i guess it's minimax so its natural?
 jacek: its implied
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: it's so easy to understand 
 MSmits: i should do an oware version of this
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: it's probably going to suck at first
 MSmits: because the parameters arent tuned for this
 MSmits: move's eval value + log(move's visits)
 MSmits: this is not uct is it?
 MSmits: oh final selection nvm
 jacek: thats final selection
 MSmits: didnt know you meant the move selection for that turn
 MSmits: allright got it
 MSmits: you also use this in onitama right?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: and othello
 jacek: yes
 jacek: the three big Os and B
 MSmits: B?
 jacek: bt
 MSmits: oh for me B is Bandas
 jacek: as its written in the article ~
 MSmits: I read like :poop:
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: and ntuples too
 MSmits: you didnt compare it with ept did you?.
 MSmits: i mean could be your NN is just awesome and it would be even more awesome in oware if you did ept
 jacek: not much
 MSmits: i had the same experience switching to ept from other algo's
 MSmits: it might have similar performance
 jacek: it came from the ept. somewhat by accident i overwrote instead of adding and it sticked
 AntiSquid: ept?
 MSmits: early playout termination
 jacek: i bet its just a scaling problem. and tuning
 Astrobytes: early playout termination
 MSmits: mcts with a short simulation or in my case, no simulation
 MSmits: so you backpropagate an eval score
 Astrobytes: you eval instead
 MSmits: this is like  a journalist at a covid press conference, summarizing the prime minister
 jacek: the paper i linked use only eval instead of uct
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: but, do you propagate -1, 1 or eval score?
 MSmits: i actually did it differently in different games, i barely see much of a difference either way
 MSmits: if you do eval score and you scale it down to between --1 and 1, thats the same as scaling up the exploration parameter instead
 MSmits: the only thing that makes a real difference is clamping
 Astrobytes: I tried the -1,1 and scaled, no difference really
 Astrobytes: ffs lol
 MSmits: thanks again for that summary
 MSmits: I tried clamping, no clamping or a sigmoid
 jacek: dunno. for me scaling to -1, 1 was meh. perhaps if NN tells you if something is 0.2 or 0.8 that eval is more accurate
 MSmits: scaling is pointless though, the exploration can be scaled as well, so any difference will be fitted away 
 MSmits: but clamping and sigmoid thingies will change it
 Astrobytes: yeah I used tanh in oware I think
 MSmits: i checked earlier and it seems like i use nothing
 MSmits: no clamping, no sigmoid, just the eval
 Astrobytes: I need to get back to that Oware soon
 MSmits: it's a bit dangerous as you can get some extreme eval scores throwing off your search
 MSmits: but apparently it doesnt hurt my bot (much?)
 Astrobytes: I think I tried every method with Oware lol
 MSmits: yeah I tried too... but its so hard to test things because of 2 things:
 MSmits: 1) RPS
 Astrobytes: Yeah but you've got MegaBook Monster Bot
 MSmits: 2) huge gap between NN's and the rest
 AntiSquid: looking at relu makes me think, just make up your own function and calculate the derivative
 Astrobytes: yeah true MSmits
 MSmits: well for me the gap is worst, because I am in the middle of it. You can use my bot as a bridge at least, when you test
 MSmits: I got nothing
 AntiSquid: but book is fixed, NN are supposed to generalize and therefore beat book ... maybe a book for corner cases to aid the NN
 MSmits: AntiSquid in my experience most NN's for board games on CG are very deterministic and easily counterbooked
 Astrobytes: shh, this will trigger a big Oware discussion
 MSmits: jacek's is the exception because he included a random component in his move selection on purpose
 AntiSquid: maybe they're overfitted MSmits and therefore work like a book :P
 MSmits: but even his book is deterministic if he removes that
 MSmits: bot that is
 Astrobytes: works great though
 MSmits: AntiSquid i dunno if they are overfitted. They work well against all sorts of bots. Overfitting is not the same as being deterministic
 MSmits: for example, a bot that always plays the best move is not overfitted but perfectly deterministic
 MSmits: most NN's are like that on CG
 MSmits: they play very very well, but once in 100 turns they make a mistake
 MSmits: and because they are deterministic, i will find it
 Astrobytes: MSmits - The Terminator
 MSmits: Robo's bot makes a mistake around ply 20 or so, with the moves I make and then he doesn't recover. The only reason I dont always win is that I can't make my book go all the way to turn 200 and my bot will also make mistakes
 MSmits: well I can actually... since he is so deterministic, but havent gotten around to that :P
 MSmits: jacek keeping me busy
 jacek: woah so you can tell at what ply bots make mistake
 MSmits: my mcts score will suddenly jump 2 whole points at that node
 MSmits: and it never goes down again
 MSmits: 2 points being 2 expected seed advantage
 MSmits: i cant be 100% sure of course, but once i found that node, my bot went from 10% to 40-50% winrate
 MSmits: so i am guessing it's real
 Astrobytes: you've had that 'feature' for some time now iirc
 MSmits: what do you mean
 Astrobytes: figuring out which ply the NNs make a mistake on (or any other player)
 MSmits: yeah, but that's mostly because I am crazy enough to manually enter opponent moves into meta mcts and search through those branches
 Astrobytes: The 'how' doesn't matter, only the end result :P
 MSmits: true
 jacek: like analyzing carlsen or karpov games
 MSmits: thats really what it's about for me. I mean getting a better rank is fun, but for most of these games its also fun to figure out what moves are good
 MSmits: for oware it's mostly about beating the NN's though, I can't make rhyme or reason out of my meta mcts for this game
 MSmits: it makes no sense
 Astrobytes: I rely on others analyses for that jacek lol
 AntiSquid: great data analysis MSmits
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/5HXtdv29">https://pastebin.com/5HXtdv29</a>
 MSmits: here's the nide
 MSmits: node
 MSmits: Robo's move is 2
 MSmits: your move is 5
 MSmits: (jacek)
 jacek: M?
 AntiSquid: i completely forgot what my bots were doing ... can't even figure out what the hell my pacman or xr bot variables stand for :D
 MSmits: marked, means my opening book wants an answer to this move
 MSmits: the * means it's forcing the search through this move
 MSmits: it's forcing through your move
 MSmits: (for obvious reasons)
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://media1.tenor.com/images/1fe6dde8e3b8d0d6dac9de18f5b51d33/tenor.gif?itemid=11666212">https://media1.tenor.com/images/1fe6dde8e3b8d0d6dac9de18f5b51d33/tenor.gif?itemid=11666212</a>
 MSmits: so your move is -1 on average it says, which means i should win more, but my bot isn't able to capitalize on the advantage most of the time... too many turns left, too good of a NN
 MSmits: (mind you this search goes 80 plies deep in some cases, which means still 120 turns left)
 MSmits: if you're interested jacek, check out this game:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493811348">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/493811348</a>  at ply 19, you'll do exactly what my meta mcts says you do
 MSmits: this is just the first game i found with me as p1 on the leaderboard, which tells you how common this is
 jacek: mhm
 MSmits: the thing is your random thingy only happens when moves are close to equally good, that doesnt happen too often
 MSmits: but with 200 turns, it does happen often enough
 MSmits: rarely your first move as p2 will be in house 11, but usually it's house 7
 MSmits: rarely as in, maybe 1 in 20
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: you could retrain your bot. Will be interesting to see what changes 
 MSmits: is it like a 1 hr thing?
 MSmits: or does it train for days?
 jacek: how can you tell its 1 in 20?
 jacek: moves.push_back(getMove(nullptr,game-&gt;getCurrentPlayer(),rand()%100&lt;95?7:11));
 MSmits: cuz i look up lost games to find more nodes to mark in my tree
 MSmits: and almost always it's house 7
 MSmits: very rare 5
 MSmits: err i mean 11
 MSmits: (i think in 0 to 5 for both players)
 jacek: actually for 1st move as p2 i use this 'opening' 95% 7 and 5% 11
 Astrobytes: the 'other 5'
 MSmits: haha
 jacek: its neat you could reverse engineer that
 MSmits: nice estimate by me then?
 Nerchio: btw guys
 Astrobytes: impressive
 MSmits: it's just by watching so many games jacek
 Nerchio: in MCTS when i expand node but have like 50 possible moves
 Nerchio: it doesnt kinda make sense to expand all 50 states or is there
 MSmits: hmm expanding is a misleading term sometimes Nerchio
 jacek: MSmits i can retrain oware overnight, thats 6h-8h.
 Nerchio: i mean in UTTT right now
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: Nerchio what i mean is, you select a node right, an unexpanded one
 Nerchio: when you can play on any position on the board its up to like 80 positions so why would i create all 80 states for this
 MSmits: then you give it children
 Nerchio: yeah i talk about giving it children
 MSmits: is that what you mean by expanding?
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: what do you do for each child?
 jacek: i always expands by all available moves. each child will have then 0 score / 0 visits
 Nerchio: nothing yet im asking before I implement it
 MSmits: i sort of do what jacek says i think
 Nerchio: well from what i understand you create a node/state for each child but
 Nerchio: you're not going to visit all of them anyway
 Nerchio: so whats the point of creatin all of them
 MSmits: sometimes i set the visit count to 1 to avoid some division by zero somewhere
 MSmits: Nerchio in some games i immediately simulate from each child
 MSmits: so i backpropagate 50 simulation results at once
 MSmits: not in uttt though, but some other players do
 Nerchio: yea so its like looking for a win depth 1
 Nerchio:&#160;?
 jacek: its implementation detail, you may expand by 1 child or all children. in early days of mcts, memory was constrained so they expanded one child per visit(s)
 Astrobytes: ^
 Nerchio: i will be coding mcts for uTTT in java i am already constrained :D
 jacek: i expand all children also because i look for mate-in-one
 MSmits: some games have a fixed number of children
 MSmits: like Bandas and Yavalath
 MSmits: so what i do is just reserve the memory and do nothign else
 MSmits: expansion -&gt; nodindex += 4
 MSmits: (for Bandas)
 Nerchio: well I guess I will try first with expanding all the children but i will probably try to prune it later in UTTT
 Nerchio: seems like a massive waste of time and space:D
 MSmits: you have to remember that you will very rarely have those moves that give 50 children
 MSmits: most will have on average 7 moves
 Nerchio: I guess that's true
 jacek: UTTT branching factor is usually &lt; 9
 Astrobytes: and it's all bit ops anyway so not gonna be a massive hit
 MSmits: expansion is less than 2% of my runtime
 MSmits: and i expand all
 jacek: rarely you will see more than 9. those will happen in late midgame or endgames with few moves left anyway
 Astrobytes: (not that I've done UTTT, I'm slightly allergic)
 MSmits: selection and simulation are most expensive
 Nerchio: well Astrobytes i don't start with bitboard :D
 MSmits: no need to start with bitboard, the trick to learn mcts is to make the sim as simple as possible for you
 MSmits: otherwise you have two sources of bugs
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, your first MCTS, my bad
 Nerchio: yeah first time i got to bronze but i think i was creating a new state when doing random playouts instead of playing it out on 1 state :D
 Astrobytes: yeah, don't do that until it's working
 Nerchio: its 2nd MCTS :D
 Nerchio: but first was kinda fail
 Astrobytes: ah right
 MSmits: oh so your first mcts was mostly monte carlo?
 Nerchio: no i think it was MCTS with many mistakes :P
 MSmits: most people make the mistake of creating the whole tree during the random sim
 MSmits: meaning they grow a huge tree very quickly
 jacek: struct?
 Nerchio: yeah thats what i was doing i think
 MSmits: struct did, mad knight did also and i noticed others do it too
 MSmits: problem is that you get a working bot that way
 Astrobytes: mk did too?
 MSmits: its just not very good
 MSmits: at first yeah
 MSmits: he knows how to do it now
 Nerchio: ok so another question i had which you guys probably know the answer for
 Astrobytes: I only knew struct did it
 MSmits: people pm me sometimes about mcts
 Nerchio: when you create a tree and like 50k states
 Nerchio: why not save parts of the tree that you go down into next rounds?
 Astrobytes: you can
 MSmits: i do
 Astrobytes: tree reuse
 jacek: tree reuse
 MSmits: almost always
 Nerchio: thats kinda what im thinking i want to do
 MSmits: but in some games you create so many nodes it's not feasible
 Nerchio: since java is so slow
 MSmits: but mostly you can
 Astrobytes: just make your start node the one you wish to start from
 MSmits: dont do treereuse immediately
 MSmits: it complicates things
 jacek: focus on the proper mcts. leave the fancy rest for later
 MSmits: also tree reuse actually means you make *more* nodes if you use an object pool
 MSmits: since you can reset to index 0 of the pool
 Nerchio: kk just wanted to know if this 'tree reuse' is something that people use :P
 MSmits: you keep moving through the pool
 Nerchio: so how many nodes do you guys reach in simulation
 Astrobytes: can get hairy really fast
 Nerchio: i think i managed to create only 300k for java but will probably use like 10% of that :D
 MSmits: depends on the game, but uttt needs 30-40 million for me sometimes
 Nerchio: :grin:
 MSmits: and i only have 20-25 in my object pool
 MSmits: but i often reset for other reasons, so it usually doesnt matter
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: and i do a check
 jacek: i can only do around 100k in second in 1st turn
 MSmits: 100k nodes?
 jacek: 100k steps. select expand rollout backpropagate
 MSmits: oh, i do between 90 and 130k in the second turn at 100 ms
 MSmits: of those rollouts as you defined it
 MSmits: lemme get a better estimate, i am running a testgame
 MSmits: Rollouts: 816384 first turn
 MSmits: Rollouts: 92928
 MSmits: second turn
 Nerchio: I would just like to enter legend in UTTT :D
 MSmits: wait a min jacek... how do you get so few rollouts and rank 8
 MSmits: what magic is this
 Astrobytes: 20k+ rollouts needed iirc for UTTT legend
 MSmits: yeah with no fancy stuff
 MSmits: thats in turn 2
 MSmits: so around 5x slower than my bot
 jacek: hmm but 100k * 7-8 is close to what you have. maybe its difference in counting
 MSmits: whats the 7-8?
 jacek: and i got into legend with java bot as well
 MSmits: a rollout for me is a single move through the tree and a single simulation
 jacek: average branching factor in the 7-8 beginniing
 MSmits: so i dont sim all children
 jacek: hmm but i dont do much fancy stuff, my sim is pretty simple
 MSmits: i wonder if it is just different ways of counting or do you also do some jacekmax(gic)
 MSmits: no fancy selection, UCT modifications, weighted sims etc?
 MSmits: rank 8 is really really good. There's at least 30 people in uttt as obsessed with it as I am in most games. Strong opposition
 jacek: well in UCT there is bonus for winning small board and penalty for giving opponent mobility
 jacek: + mcts solver of course
 MSmits: oh right, well those are good bonuses I guess, gives you +5 or +10&#160;% winrate when everything else is the same
 jacek: as for sim, there is mate-in-one checking and more chance for winning small board
 Astrobytes: seems smart
 DomiKo: 90K on second round wow
 DomiKo: i got like 45K right now...
 MSmits: 130k sometimes, depends on the cpu
 MSmits: re curse says he has 180k
 Astrobytes: nice
 DomiKo: Karliso then 200K? XD
 MSmits: kar liso said near 400k but he counts differently 
 MSmits: still has way better performance somehow
 MSmits: his way of counting woul dget me to 250k or so
 Astrobytes: he's still #1?
 darkhorse64: karliso does not talk he just gets #1
 MSmits: he is yeah
 MSmits: also he removed his book I believe
 Astrobytes: oh really?
 MSmits: so I can no longer wreck him 100% :P
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: he does talk sometimes
 darkhorse64: look at his profile. He is #1 in all hisbots or nearly
 MSmits: yeah karliso is nice, he's a bit like robo in that he doesn't talk much, but when he does, it's golden
 darkhorse64: Then I missed what he says
 MSmits: yeah it's getting annoying how he is always slightly stronger than me in every board game :P
 Astrobytes: sure he reads more than he talks
 MSmits: he sometimes asks very basic questions
 MSmits: like nerchio just did
 MSmits: totally weird for such a strong player
 Nerchio: thanks!
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's quite confusing at times
 MSmits: hey i am comparing you to the best board game player nerchio :0
 Astrobytes: But he doesn't give away his initial approach fully, he might figure out interesting heuristics initially etc
 MSmits: he asks how mcts works and such, then he writes a mcts and a week later he is nr 1
 MSmits: he opened up a bit later on, at first he said nothing
 MSmits: he shares a little bit now 
 Astrobytes: Oh ok, didn't see him for a bit. My absence, no doubt
 MSmits: the thing is that if he didn't have such success, we would have had no problem with him just asking questions
 MSmits: but he asks questions, we help him and then he wrecks us :P
 MSmits: so now he has to share some too&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: hehehe, sharing is caring 
 jacek: friendship is magic
 MSmits: for a long time i thought he was daporan messing with us :P
 MSmits: but he's not
 jacek: daporan?
 MSmits: ah, was this before your time jacek?
 Astrobytes: No, defo not dapo. I spoke with dapo back when I was diagnosed with my back issues, last time I've seen him
 MSmits: he always showed up for contests with prizes, took the win, shared nothing an dleft
 MSmits: really strong player
 MSmits: also had nr 1 csb for a long time
 Astrobytes: actually, if you talked to him he would share stuff
 jacek: hmm google search for dapron reveals youtube ai videos
 MSmits: yeah he did later when i talked with him sometimes
 MSmits: but that's how he is viewed generally
 MSmits: he doesnt write post mortems and such
 MSmits: yeah i think thats him jacek
 Astrobytes: No, he didn't like the hating because he did the hiding thing
 MSmits: he did one for mean max
 MSmits: he won it with a GA
 MSmits: and then made the video
 Astrobytes: He's a really nice guy actually
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah the hiding thing didnt help his image 
 MSmits: he is i guess
 MSmits: maybe just misunderstood
 Astrobytes: He just didn't like the hating
 MSmits: I can see that
 MSmits: that stuff happened mostly before i was here, but it echoed a lot after on chat here
 Astrobytes: hence 1 less CG player
 AntiSquid: no the hiding wasn't the issue lol
 MSmits: ah here's a vet that knows
 DomiKo: board game's are hard
 MSmits: easy to sim, hard to win
 DomiKo: because you have to make quick board class
 MSmits: a class, whats that?
 MSmits: uint64_t board
 DomiKo: but making fast random moves
 DomiKo: and generating moves
 DomiKo: that the really hard part of board games
 MSmits: my only class is usually Node{}
 MSmits: sometimes i have a State class for a hash table for opening books or something but thats it
 MSmits: DomiKo you mean fast sim in general, in uttt it is fast random, but i dont even use random in most games
 jacek: well only the uttt is optim fest, other board games could be slower with smart heuristic
 DomiKo: that could be true
 DomiKo: in UTTT heuristic really don't do that well
 DomiKo: or I don't know how to use them&#160;:((

 Astrobytes: You posted it already
 codeing: you'd not looked it
 Astrobytes: Why would I look at it
 codeing: because it's important
 Astrobytes: I covered UML in a course a long time ago, why would I look at it
 darkhorse64: UML is boring and useless
 Astrobytes: ^
 codeing: what&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Can be useful for a quick sketch on a whiteboard but then so can random squares and circles
 codeing: darkhorse64
 codeing: how you code a software  without uml&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Really easily
 codeing: i understand,  you are not architect
 codeing: or something like thaht
 codeing: ez
 darkhorse64: I have  been involved in several multi-million lines of code projects
 codeing: and&#160;?
 darkhorse64: UML does not help
 codeing: what help so&#160;?
 codeing: how do you establish the architecture of your software?
 darkhorse64: Paper cannot capture the dynamics of data nor it can capture all the small details that will make your paper design baly fail
 darkhorse64: *badly*
 Astrobytes: I only have limited experience but even that taught me that a working model is better than some hopeful diagram
 darkhorse64: UML is like a battle plan. After 15 mn, no plan will resist fire
 Astrobytes: I wish I could have written that on my exam paper :P
 codeing: what your level Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: level? I'm a biologist. I've done some CS study is all
 darkhorse64: My experience is that a good design will look at how data flows. Then, you can model objects, threads
 codeing: CS&#160;?
 HelloWorld183L: computer science
 codeing: in CS, what your level at university&#160;?
 Astrobytes: I have a masters in cell biology, not CS, I've just done additional study in CS
 codeing: what does biologists do there&#160;?
 HelloWorld183L: what programming paradigms would be most useful for a biologist?
 codeing: joking
 Astrobytes: It's all about data and stats
 Astrobytes: When I was doing more biology-related things I left that to the bioinformatics department
 Astrobytes: Lots of python and R

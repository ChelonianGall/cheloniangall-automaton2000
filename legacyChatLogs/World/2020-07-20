 bartekkowalski: bruh what is lua
 pinarica: roblox
 bartekkowalski: huh
 pinarica: its used in roblox to for user generated content
 bartekkowalski: I swear half of these programming languages are like almost the same but like on little difference just to piss everyone off
 pinarica: syntax is half the battle I guess, for better or worse, I think its for the best
 bartekkowalski: yeah i guess
 jrke: is there any thing like input().split() in c++
 Marchete: hmm has thor codegolf  changed?
 Marchete: nvm read the forum
 jrke: code golf you mean power of thor?
 Marchete: yes
 jrke: ah! yes i got up and saw an increase in my rank of power of thor automatically i was shocked and later i discovered the change&#160;;)
 jrke: but whats the change?
 Marchete: different validators
 jrke: k
 pinarica: cant seem to get past one of the sudoku validators and the only things hardcoded in my code would be the for loop iterators
 pinarica: subgrid error validator 
 pinarica: when I submit it fails with the testcases it does not, I have barely anything harcoded
 AggYzz: imagine using a low level langugae for shortest code
 whay: hi
 AggYzz: bye
 whay: what do you man
 whay: wait
 AggYzz: why ddo you woman
 whay: wait
 AggYzz: sleep
 whay: what is your name
 jacek: good morning
 WINWINWIN: pinarica, I know that it is a late response, but I think the reason for the sudoku error is that you are checking sum of row and column to 45
 WINWINWIN: But there may be a validator that sums to 45 but does not satisfy the 123456789 requirement.
 DomiKo: good morning
 whay: hi
 whay: you can tellr me
 HDit: hôm nay là thứ 7
 HuynhNgocHai: Hello
 HuynhNgocHai: Hôm nay là thứ 7
 whay: hi
 whay: how can help tyou
 Astrobytes: HDit, HuynhNgocHai: please speak English in World chat, you can create your own channel if you like
 Edjy: Dear codingamers, I NEED YOU&#160;! I need help to finish my CG logo here&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pixelcanvas.io/@11161,15">https://pixelcanvas.io/@11161,15</a> (it is not hard and doesn't take too much time) you just have to place one or two pixels
 Astrobytes: Edjy: Please do not spam the chat with off-site links
 Edjy: ok
 jacek: thats edgy
 DiL: Hi everyone! I think I found a "bugged" clash: my solution doesn't pass all tests (one is failing for timeout) but got 100% score. What's the best way to fix it?
 Uljahn: forget about it and go on
 Uljahn: timeout could be caused by debug mode of your language or by different CPU
 TonAtHere: HI guys where do i can learn about lua?
 aCat: TonAtHere I suppose there is no a lua course available I could recommend right away
 aCat: Depends do you know how to program or not
 aCat: I would simply advise doing some stuff and forcing yourself to do it in lua
 aCat: Like codingame puzzle - and search lua docs and web for solutions 'how to write some construction'
 aCat: lua is quite specific language, if you want to know something specific - or need to know it for writing plugin for some game you can as me some dicrect questions
 itzblinkzy: share your code please
 itzblinkzy: :cry:
 jrke: whats the fastest record for testcase 1 in search race&#160;?
 abraaobarros: Hi, guys. I posted my code on github. link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/abraaobarros/code-rings-codingames/blob/master/src/index.ts">https://github.com/abraaobarros/code-rings-codingames/blob/master/src/index.ts</a> :thumbsup: . 
 abraaobarros: I will try to improve with loops.  feedbacks and pr's are welcome
 Zenoscave: I'm not sure code sharing in a competitive setting like this is encouraged.
 macobo: At some point you will hit a ceiling trying to learn without external feedback.
 macobo: Sharing code and learning from what others have shared is one way to overcome that.
 abraaobarros: exactly
 Zenoscave: I absolutely agree. Except that this is an ongoing competition. Sharing small ideas and snippets is fine but an entire solution is generally frowned upon
 Zenoscave: as a heads up, if it were an actively ranking current competition that would be a definite disqualification. It has happened in the past
 SPDene: I don't know where you get that idea from. A huge benefit of this site s being able to learn from  looking at code that someone shared.
 Zenoscave: Perhaps the owner's stance on the difference between puzzles and ongoing challenges, and my years spent here where this topic is repeated many times is where I get the idea from
 SPDene: ok, next time I share my code, I'll bear in mind that the owner may disqualify me from playing CoC ever again /s
 Zenoscave: I don't mean to discourage sharing or learning. Just the modicum in which it was presented. Sharing ideas is a wonderful thing. SPDene this wasn't about CoC...
 Zenoscave: I was referring to the Code of the rings code posted earlier
 macobo: Oops. Sorry for pouring oil on the fire here, was lacking context. :bow: Indeed, this case it might be murkier, though I'd expect to be a explicit T&amp;C if it's discouraged.
 Zenoscave: But do realize that even in CoC people scrape solutions to use as their own with a bot. It is encouraged to share but also be aware of its ramifications
 Zenoscave: The forums have many resources discussing it. but, yeah, a T&amp;C would be nice
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum">https://www.codingame.com/forum</a>

 Zenoscave: F.A.Q. ^^^
 DiL: why would someone use a bot to play CoC?
 WINWINWIN: To win continuously&#160;:)
 macobo: because imaginary internet points?
 DiL: and... so?&#160;:-) is it funny?
 itzblinkzy: how boring
 blueman34: I suggest reading lua documentation.
 ANONYMOUS42: i suck at ruby
 blueman34: I suck at everything.
 blueman34: :c
 macobo: That's the first step to getting better o/
 MSmits: except for the sucking part. He can only get worse at sucking from this point on
 macobo: Eh, if you work hard enough...
 MSmits: I think you misunderstand me
 macobo: :D I'm not sure I do.
 MSmits: He sucks at everything. He is the absolute top at it. It cannot get better
 MSmits: it can only get worse
 MSmits: so he will get better at everything except sucking
 macobo: Unknown unknowns getting revealed&#160;;)
 MSmits: exactly
 itzblinkzy: im okay at coding but im so baad at math its annoys me 
 itzblinkzy: :pensive:
 blueman34: im the opposite
 blueman34: bad coder
 blueman34: good mather
 DomiKo: you can use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://projecteuler.net/">https://projecteuler.net/</a> to improve math skill
 ANONYMOUS42: team up and you can be good at both
 LoGos: or bad at both
 blueman34: yes
 LoGos: I mean if you combined them
 blueman34: im so close to sloving this clash of code
 blueman34: but i hate lua
 blueman34: such a restricted lang
 whay: hi
 blueman34: i trying to figure out of to round up a decimal
 whay: hiiiii
 whay: telle me
 ANONYMOUS42: are you trying some fancy interval maths or just using an array lol
 ANONYMOUS42: don't think it would be better in term of code length like that though
 whay: Damn you answer me
 blueman34: yes
 ANONYMOUS42: hi
 blueman34: because
 blueman34: its a shortest mode
 blueman34: so
 blueman34: rip
 whay: :rage:
 whay:  answer me
 whay: hi
 blueman34: i got 50%
 bartekkowalski: what
 blueman34: even though i managed to get 3/4 correct&#160;:/
 whay: i got 25
 bartekkowalski: lmao rip
 whay: fuk you
 blueman34: should've been 75%
 macobo: public test cases&#160;!= scoring test cases
 DomiKo: that's right
 blueman34: i mean 3/4 is 75% so
 sveder: 0
 whay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://geekprank.com/hacker/">https://geekprank.com/hacker/</a>
 Schwase: no blueman, 3/4 = 0
 jacek: so mathy
 ANONYMOUS42: 3//4=0
 DomiKo: oh wow just found minus error in MCTS
 ANONYMOUS42: what's MCTS
 DomiKo: Monte Carlt Tree Search
 whay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://geekprank.com/hacker/">https://geekprank.com/hacker/</a>
 ANONYMOUS42: ah ok
 DomiKo: Monte Carlo Tree Search*
 DomiKo: sign error are the funniest
 jacek: aww
 bartekkowalski: bruh what is this
 Truntaler: czesc
 DomiKo: ohhh yes top50 in UTTT
 DomiKo: one wrong sign = one day of debuging
 DomiKo: oh yes
 jacek: what did you say? i cant see that low
 DomiKo:&#160;:&lt;
 MSmits: grats DomiKo
 DomiKo: now time for Othello
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits: been fitting parameters myself these last few days :P
 MSmits: no new submit yet though
 MSmits: getting some rare wins vs dbd r now
 MSmits: 5-10%
 DomiKo: wow
 MSmits: well the emphasis is on rare 
 MSmits: but before I was winning 0 out of 100 so... progress&#160;:)
 itzblinkzy: damn it share your code please i've only been coding for a week and some of these questions are so hard :pensive: 
 MSmits: are you talking about clash?
 itzblinkzy: only way I can learn are from other people who solved it
 itzblinkzy: yes clash
 MSmits: but clashes are easier than easy puzzles
 MSmits: i've never done a clash myself
 Astrobytes: I fixed some Othello bugs, I'm coming for you all. Very slowly.
 MSmits: but that's what I've been told
 MSmits: gj Astrobytes&#160;:)
 DomiKo: clashes sometimes are tricky
 DomiKo: or the text is really not clear
 MSmits: then they are just bad
 MSmits: if not clear
 DomiKo: yap
 MSmits: should be edited
 jacek: well reverse mode are not clear&#160;:&lt;
 itzblinkzy: well thats the point
 Astrobytes: Forgot to change my aspiration window size, was pruning almost everything lol
 MSmits: the problem statement should never be the issue
 MSmits: whats an aspiration window size
 Astrobytes: the size of my aspiration window
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: ohhh right of course
 MSmits: thanks for that clarification
 jacek: but in aspiration window you re-search when out of bounds eh
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: is this like PVS?
 MSmits: or null window
 Astrobytes: null window is related yeah
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: did you fix your TT?
 MSmits: a good way to check if it works is if you solve sooner
 MSmits: with yavalath i solve sooner with TT on
 Astrobytes: I removed it for the time being until I fix everything else
 Astrobytes: Got some time off from the desk job this week so hopefully have some time to work on things
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: Othello has some serious RPS 
 MSmits: like Oware, very similar
 eulerscheZahl: "Forgot to change my aspiration window size, was pruning almost everything lol"have you tried chokudai search? :P
 MSmits: I have versions with 60% winrate vs Robo
 MSmits: and this:
 MSmits: 19:43:39,434 INFO   Temporary results for othello.cpp (ETA&#160;: 11 minutes)&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/407f27f3-5139-4503-bf2e-42816f6857ce">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/407f27f3-5139-4503-bf2e-42816f6857ce</a>
 MSmits: so I get to pick who I do good against... once again :P
 eulerscheZahl: is that win a rust timeout?
 Astrobytes: chokudai... that's that beam searching DFS thingy right?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: it's actual wins
 MSmits: 5-10% vs dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: beam search with iterative widening instead of deepening
 MSmits: dbdr uploaded a compiled version I believe
 dbdr: :scream: :D
 Astrobytes: ah yeah
 eulerscheZahl: now you pinged him, see what you've done
 Astrobytes: nice work MSmits
 DomiKo: really nice
 MSmits: lol thats ok
 MSmits: he doesnt mind
 dbdr: I don't mind pings
 eulerscheZahl: then invite him to CoC
 MSmits: jacek also has some wins vs dbdr
 dbdr: using a book MSmits?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: just fitting params
 MSmits: this is not a submitted version
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: I have less than 10 params I am fitting. All the usual stuff you find about Othello
 MSmits: corners, edges, stable cells, mobility, frontier etc. Everything has a param
 Astrobytes: Got your frontiers working now then
 MSmits: No idea
 MSmits: I havent fitted it yet
 Astrobytes: ah right
 MSmits: it's just in there with a param of 100
 jacek: use TDL luke
 MSmits: maybe it hurts me
 MSmits: jacek I will if I get some good example code
 MSmits: I have no idea where to start on TDL
 jacek: star from the beginning
 MSmits: show me the beginning&#160;:)
 MSmits: how did you learn?
 Astrobytes: He did the maffs innit
 jacek: started with tic tac toe
 MSmits: the maffs?
 Astrobytes: (maths)
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: jacek that sounds like you were doing a NN?
 jacek: once again i dont like fancy math
 MSmits: TDL is also just about fitting a few params, it doesnt have to be a NN does it?
 Astrobytes: All those squiggles...
 jacek: i have NN only for oware
 jacek: yes, tdl can fit other params
 MSmits: ok but what params did you fit for TTT?
 jacek: aside from N tuples i have frontiers and mobility, and it alaways show frontiers are bad
 MSmits: most times i hear about people doing learning for TTT it's a NN or Q learning or something
 jacek: i used 3x1 N tuples for tic tac toe
 MSmits: ohh ok ntuples
 jacek: but for real start, i used direct table
 jacek: unsurpisingly, it learned to play perfectly then
 MSmits: direct table means every boardstate has a param?
 MSmits: 0-8?
 jacek: yes. generaly hashmap
 jacek: board state -&gt; win/lose
 MSmits: oh ok, well that works too
 MSmits: action vs state
 jacek: 19683 possible states, while not much, this is not the point to learn every possible state and its value
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: tell me about it, the number 19683 appears A LOT in my uttt bot :P
 jacek: with 8 3x1 Ntuples, x2 (for each player), so 8 * 54 = 432 weights it still can play perfectly
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: there are ways to play perfectly with far fewer params I am sure
 MSmits: but its a good way to test
 jacek: at the very least, you can see if the code is good
 MSmits: did you start from someone elses pseudo/example code? Or did you start from explanation/math&#160;?
 jacek: from explanation
 MSmits: well good job, thats not easy
 MSmits: hope I have the patience to figure it out that way as well
 jacek: well now i have framework for training, which i used to train oware, othello and onitama
 jacek: you can see the results
 MSmits: I see it yeah
 MSmits: funny thing btw, for a day or two I was convinced you had an opening book because your bot seemed deterministic on oware, for like 20 plies
 MSmits: and it also seemed to always make the best move according to my meta mcts
 MSmits: then it suddenly changed its 2nd ply move
 MSmits: it rarely plays 11 instead of 7
 MSmits: as you would say
 MSmits: so it's not a book
 MSmits: it's just really good
 Astrobytes: It is rather excellent
 MSmits: I can counter book it rather easily in the sense that it's super deterministic, but I have to find a mistake first and i havent
 MSmits: Also, when I put my book in, my bot played worse =/
 whay: hi
 jacek: it may be a little nondeterministic, i randomly add +/- 0.02 to UCB
 MSmits: the reason is, I think, that my book currently finds the 1 reply on 2nd ply better than the 5 and all my params are fitted for 5
 MSmits: jacek it really isnt, your bot is super deterministic
 MSmits: there are only 5 moves to choose from and usually only 1 or 2 are even worth considering
 MSmits: so it's not surprising most good bots will be deterministic
 jacek: and yet you pulled me below robo&#160;:(
 MSmits: Robo's bot is also very very good, I have the same problem when trying to counterbook him
 Astrobytes: So narrow
 MSmits: I can beat recurse and agade without book currently, or at least around 50%. But nothing works well against robo and you jacek
 MSmits: my current version has no book btw. I just tried it once
 Astrobytes: Is it helpful?
 MSmits: but i got losses against lower players
 MSmits: no because its not compatible with my overfitted paramns
 MSmits: i will choose a different opening
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 MSmits: if the book gets deeper and i refit params, it might work
 MSmits: there's a chance my bot just performs poorly in the 7-20 seed region. In that case no book will help me
 Astrobytes: Maybe a case of finding the right weight for the book moves vs the rest of your params
 whay: hiiii
 jacek: ohai
 Astrobytes: whay, do you have anything useful to say other than 'hi'?
 MSmits: Astrobytes there is no weight for my book moves. I simply play them
 Astrobytes: That's not always optimal MSmits
 MSmits: why not?
 Astrobytes: In your case, your eval is sometimes better than book
 MSmits: if it were, why would I not have noticed this when playing offline?
 MSmits: i use the same eval
 whay: i hate all
 MSmits: i just spend more calc time and go deeper
 MSmits: so I dont see why the 50 ms spent on CG is ever going to be more trustworthy
 MSmits: Maybe it's an implementation thingy
 MSmits: btw not saying you're wrong per sé Astrobytes. From what I read about opening books, the eval is sometimes preferred over the book result. I think it depends on what you decide to put in your book and what you don't. I set a cutoff at 10k games. If a node has less than 10k games played, it's best move is not put in the book
 MSmits: so thats maybe 3 hrs of calculation time vs 50 ms
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I guess you kinda don't need to weight your book moves in your case
 jacek: i think it also depends how your bot react to the position left by book
 jacek: book moves can be really good, but bot too dumb to make use of it
 MSmits: yes jacek, that's my problem currently. My bot gets put into situations the parameters are not fitted for
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's also true
 MSmits: it's not that it's dumb, it's that you can't really deal with all possible board layouts wit just 10 params
 MSmits: so it specializes
 jacek: so use 16k params like me *.*
 MSmits: I use books for that :P
 MSmits: just havent been succesful in oware (yet)&#160;:)
 whay: hi
 MSmits: i think it's really cool to see the program tell me all those NN's do indeed play the best moves though
 MSmits: i doubt they make more than 5-10 mistakes over a 100 ply game
 MSmits: when they solved awari it was also found that usually 5-10 mistakes were made by the best competitive bots
 MSmits: and this was a while ago, I think our NN's might be up to that level
 jacek: i tested and my alt was 47 with 1-ply search
 MSmits: rank 47 in oware?
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: hmm seems good but hard to say
 Laminator: how do you guys go about training your models on these games? Is there like an api to call?
 MSmits: no support at all
 MSmits: completely trained offline
 MSmits: in your own framework, you can use tensorflow, keras, pytorch or whatnot
 MSmits: then you put in something that fits into the codesize
 MSmits: which is 100k characters
 MSmits: this includes all the code
 MSmits: it's quite an accomplishment to make a NN work on CG
 Laminator: So you have to get the source code for the game or recreate it?
 MSmits: well most NN's here are written for simple board games, so the source code would be a few 100 lines
 MSmits: but you can use a java referee if you want
 MSmits: most games have them
 Astrobytes: Source code is usually given or simple enough mechanics that you can implement it easily yourself
 MSmits: I always write it myself for offline programs
 MSmits: usually the java ref is slow to setup
 Astrobytes: It's mostly faster if you implement yourself, but that's not totally necessary (as per karlis o)
 Astrobytes: And yeah MSmits
 MSmits: i remember for locam i was fitting params using brutaltester referees
 MSmits: the nr 1 used his own version and did like 10k games per hour
 MSmits: because locam did not need much calc time and the limiting factor was the referee
 Astrobytes: who was #1? closet AI?
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: 10k per hour? i remember that differently (as in: much more)
 MSmits: he did a total of 100k games or so
 MSmits: I guesstimated it to 10k/hour, i dunno
 MSmits: i remember the 100k number from his PM
 Laminator: Very neat. I just finished an RL class last semester so it'll be nice to try to implement. 
 MSmits: maybe it was 100k a day?
 MSmits: Laminator try it on a simple game. Oware we know is good for it.
 DomiKo: is there any game where QL will be good?
 DomiKo: QLearning*
 MSmits: QL is not useful for games that arent solved is it?
 eulerscheZahl: "When testing a change running 100K games was a standard way to decide whether it is an improvement."
 eulerscheZahl: so 100k multiple times
 MSmits: yeah, but it was 30 day contest, so we'll never know :P
 Laminator: As long as the states variables are discrete,  I think QL could work. 
 eulerscheZahl: let's quote recurse instead:"I am talking about self-playing at a rate of around 1000 games per second here."
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: ok... i stand corrected&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: closet did the whole draft order with selfplay. that needs a lot of batches with 100k each
 MSmits: yeah, I know, I tested with 1-2k batches and it was useless
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 eulerscheZahl: did the same
 eulerscheZahl: 500 games: yay it's better \o/1000: wait a second...
 MSmits: when fitting params for board games I usually do 400 games vs 5 different players and it works fine. At least for rough estimates
 MSmits: thats 400 total
 MSmits: 80 per
 Astrobytes: I just fumbled around in the dark for a week lol
 eulerscheZahl: i hated the game and downloaded matches to steal the draft from others
 eulerscheZahl: also smits was a great help as he gave me some order
 MSmits: yeah you did that
 Astrobytes: I remember :D
 MSmits: i spent 5 hrs stealing it by hand
 eulerscheZahl: instantly 75% wins vs my old bot
 MSmits: i just watched a ton of games
 Astrobytes: Was kinda sad it was reduced to that
 MSmits: to see what he preferred
 eulerscheZahl: and i told you that you can manually set the cards in draft
 MSmits: i went to rank 1 immediately when i did that, i guess the rest of my bot was still better than most at that time... i stayed like a few hrs at 1 :P
 eulerscheZahl: even 3 times the same and recurse printing his fake stats to give different score to them :D
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: the sad thing is that games like this have so much unknown info that it's hard to do any smart algorithms
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/">https://www.adrienvannson.fr/cg-ranking/</a>you plateaued a while
 MSmits: everyone just bruteforced it and the draft was so unbalanced that the difference between objective strengths of the cards was greater than the need for balance
 DomiKo: MSmits how you play those 80 games per player?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark">https://github.com/s-vivien/CGBenchmark</a>
 MSmits: automated IDE games basically
 eulerscheZahl: or play by hand
 DomiKo: thanks
 MSmits: oh right, i see i was at 1 for a while, nice find eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: I think I was when legend opened
 MSmits: interesting, I guess my end result at rank 5 wasnt as lucky as I thought it was, i actually went down over time
 MSmits: massive submissions distorting the last few days prolly
 eulerscheZahl: i went pretty downhill too in the last hours :D
 MSmits: yeah you were unlucky, the graph shows a small dive at the end
 whay: level up
 whay: 4
 MSmits: I gave it to you?
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: after my 5 hrs of madness
 eulerscheZahl: but you told me not to tell on chat that you did :flushed:
 MSmits: sounds like me
 MSmits: I guess you helped me a lot too and i felt obligated to share
 eulerscheZahl: i guess it doesn't matter anymore, 2 years ago
 eulerscheZahl: now the info is leaked
 MSmits: yep
 whay: You are racists, do not speak to me
 Astrobytes: whay, really. Please go and waste your time elsewhere.
 eulerscheZahl: shush, don't talk to him!
 whay: talking to me
 MSmits: uh oh, you fed the troll
 Scarfield: feed the ducks not the trolls, btw has there been made any new mods for chat?
 Astrobytes: It's not been done yet Modfield
 jacek: arent you mods already?
 eulerscheZahl: on the way, delayed
 eulerscheZahl: because of homepage redesign
 Astrobytes: *'Quest Map'
 eulerscheZahl: that
 MSmits: noone here is a mod are they?
 MSmits: dont you get a disk or something?
 eulerscheZahl: but 2 are about to become one
 MSmits: who?
 whay: What did you say about me?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 if you dig a little more in the chat history
 bartekkowalski:  nize it
 eulerscheZahl: about 7 in total IIRC
 MSmits: how do they decide who to make mods?
 MSmits: I mean I am assuming you'll be mod
 Astrobytes: 8 I think
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud asked here on chat to suggest names
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I nominated euler
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: good choice
 eulerscheZahl: noble Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Thibaud asked me directly, also WIN WIN WIN
 whay: im arabic So do not talk to me
 Astrobytes: And we suggested some others
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: i declined
 eulerscheZahl: also: robo, dbd r, struct, Neuman n
 MSmits: good, then we can more quickly get rid of spammers
 eulerscheZahl: and uljah n
 Astrobytes: yup
 Uljahn: im in doubt
 jacek: ee
 whay: Damn you do not talk to me
 MSmits: why are you doubtful Uljahn?
 Astrobytes: Why so Uljahn?
 eulerscheZahl: you need a dictator for #ru
 Scarfield: with great power, comes great responsibility
 MSmits: Spiderfield
 eulerscheZahl: i'm moderator on discord for a year maybe. Deleted less than 5 messages in that time, no kicks or bans
 whay: i love nazs
 MSmits: your presence is enough
 eulerscheZahl: either there is much less trolling or i'm online at the wrong time. or both
 whay: :rage:
 Astrobytes: Discord's pretty tame in comparison to CG chat spam-wise
 Scarfield: or online at the right time :thinking:
 whay: :rage:
 MSmits: CG chat is easy to get into
 whay: telle me
 Astrobytes: yeah, discord requires more than a click I guess
 jacek: and elements of harmony
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: I sense an obscure reference
 jacek: obscure?
 MSmits: well  Idon't know it, obscure to me
 jacek: try image google discord
 eulerscheZahl: afk cat time
 Scarfield: just googled it, its my little pony 
 Astrobytes: discord... harmony...
 Scarfield: ooh
 MSmits: lol...
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: argh
 Astrobytes: stupid MLP
 jacek: voiced by Q
 Astrobytes: I was thinking musically
 leojean890: eulerscheZahl your bender episode 4 is not easy ;P
 MSmits: he has made harder puzzles
 MSmits: well...1
 leojean890: I believe you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, try Space Maze. And get your ray-casting A* NN ready
 Astrobytes: (last part is a joke btw)
 leojean890: "very hard" category I suppose:)
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: leojean890 do you do  a lot of puzzles?
 leojean890: I began "training" part with puzzles only 2 or 3 weeks ago :P
 leojean890: before, I did only multis and optims;)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 leojean890: but I did all the easy and medium ones
 whay: msmits?
 leojean890: only the official CG ones
 MSmits: I enjoy them, but when I do a puzzle I always think I am going to be lagging behind on my multis&#160;:)
 leojean890: for the momeht
 leojean890: lagging behind&#160;? you mean it prevents you from improving your multis&#160;?:P
 MSmits: yeah
 leojean890: because you do something else
 MSmits: new multis come out all the time and i cant keep up
 leojean890: so it slows your multis improvement down :P
 MSmits: thats it
 Astrobytes: Haven't done any puzzles for a while, I tend to go on a little spree of doing them then leave it for a while
 leojean890: I saw that you have many great rankings indeed :P
 leojean890: it's hard compet in the top of each ;P
 MSmits: thanks, yeah it is
 leojean890: I never reached it for the moment :P
 MSmits: i am not particularly fast though
 leojean890: (top of multis&#160;!)
 MSmits: I tend to stay obsessed long enough to get top 3-5
 leojean890: I am around 28 in vindinium, bandas, oware..
 Astrobytes: You're not #1 in any MSmits? I'm sure you were before
 MSmits: yavalath currently
 leojean890: but next spots are harder ;P
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 MSmits: rest, close
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: uttt close
 MSmits: onitama close
 MSmits: was nr 1 there both of them
 MSmits: oware too, for a little bit, but the NN's took over again&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol yeah, indeed
 leojean890: I have to learn how to do them ;P
 MSmits: me too, mostly for work though. I don't think I'll enjoy it that much beyond academic interest. I don't see myself obsessively try to get nr 1 with a NN
 Astrobytes: And you can do pretty damn good without them
 _Akira_: Hi
 Astrobytes: (on CG I mean)
 MSmits: yeah&#160;:) 
 MSmits: hi  _Akira_
 leojean890: spots &lt; #20 are hard to reach, right ;p
 MSmits: depends a lot on the multi leojean890
 leojean890: for little ones I meant ;P
 MSmits: sometimes only the top 10 is strong and the rest is much weaker
 leojean890: for populated ones
 MSmits: twixt-PP top 10 should not be too hard
 leojean890: it's hard to reach #100 :P
 MSmits: or paper soccer
 _Akira_: have you played the power of thor
 MSmits: yeah
 _Akira_:&#160;?
 _Akira_: ok
 MSmits: leojean890 hypersonic top 100 is really hard
 leojean890: beam search, right&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 leojean890: I have to throw my python away
 leojean890: :p
 leojean890: for this one:)
 MSmits: yeah you need C#/java or faster there
 leojean890: I already did it for othello and oware&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: top 5 for Othello
 leojean890: C++
 leojean890: but still #22, #30
 leojean890: (minmax both)
 MSmits: I think an inexperienced board game player would find it hard to get past you Astrobytes
 whay: I'm not joking
 MSmits: so top 5 is not the only hard part
 Astrobytes: Fair, it does have mini leagues as you can see by the score diffs
 whay: I'm not joking  خن
 MSmits: it's just that these board games have a high concentration of good players in a small league
 Astrobytes: True
 Astrobytes: It gives a good sense of accomplishment that way I feel
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I dont need to see the rank to know I did well
 MSmits: If i see myself near tric trac, I know i did ok
 leojean890: I heard that the first use minmax in othello
 whay: I'm not joking
 Astrobytes: With multi probcut though leojean890
 MSmits: leojean890 most use minmax yes, but with a lot of enhancements
 MSmits: multi probcut is a really exotic one
 leojean890: oh, using cutting&#160;?
 Astrobytes: (just misread that as erotic, wtf!)
 leojean890: I should read about multi probcut
 MSmits: its a pruning strategy thats almost like a neural network to decide what to prune
 leojean890: oh ok
 MSmits: Astrobytes has a dirty mind
 leojean890: I see, didn't know this one 
 Astrobytes: It's like a multiple linear regression to tune your alpha and beta (to put it really simply)
 MSmits: I use a mcts variant with eval instead of random rollout
 Astrobytes: Check it out, lots of info out there, chessprogrammingwiki, some papers
 leojean890: thanks for the tips, I will read about that&#160;!
 jacek: or use jacekmax, the most awesomest algo there is
 leojean890:&#160;;)
 MSmits: naturally
 Astrobytes: hehe ofc
 DomiKo: there is that moment
 DomiKo: in life
 MSmits: things can only get better when you add max to them
 DomiKo: when you want to read about sommeting
 DomiKo: and first google search
 DomiKo: is jacek comment on github
 MSmits: which one?
 MSmits: link us
 DomiKo: ok not the first
 Astrobytes: must be benchmark
 DomiKo: third
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues/81">https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel/issues/81</a>
 Astrobytes: ah
 DomiKo: i was searching for mcts solver
 DomiKo: and found jacek github&#160;;)
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: dooooxxxxed
 MSmits: Robo uses mcts solver in his nn's
 jacek: solver should be part of 'vanilla' mcts
 leojean890: he has a good perf in othello as well&#160;!
 MSmits: agreed, but it doesnt always help very much
 MSmits: leojean890 Robo always does well when he tries
 leojean890: yeah, like for pacman&#160;:)
 MSmits: he won a contest before
 leojean890: oh nice
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/code-royale/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/code-royale/leaderboard/global</a>
 leojean890: ow this one
 leojean890: not my best multi&#160;:)
 leojean890: hard to simulate I think
 MSmits: it was my first contest
 leojean890: maybe will do that one day
 Astrobytes: I still hate that game lol
 MSmits: yeah not that easy
 leojean890: I agree
 leojean890: nor botg&#160;;)
 MSmits: never tried that
 MSmits: but I hear bad things :P
 Astrobytes: I didn't do the contest but after all those Wood leagues I got bored
 leojean890: very hard to simulate&#160;;)
 MSmits: did you try kutulu?
 leojean890: I reached bronze in botg with easy code (5 lines&#160;?)
 leojean890: but after it's harder
 eulerscheZahl: you will even struggle to put the BotG engine into 100k chars :D
 leojean890: kutulu yes, I'm ranked #120
 MSmits: ahh ok, i found it hard to come up with a search for that
 leojean890: MSmits, I read your PM btw
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: i remember drawing lots of circles for that
 leojean890: smitsimax&#160;:)
 MSmits: that was the first iteration
 Astrobytes: Smitsimax: First Blood
 eulerscheZahl: took a while to get popular among other players
 leojean890: to code botg engine with 100k chars, indeed..:P
 MSmits: because of CSB
 MSmits: it became popular for a while
 leojean890: some people tried to use it for pacman, I read 
 MSmits: even though almost noone pulled it off there
 MSmits: yeah
 leojean890: but had difficulties
 MSmits: for some reason it was most effectively used in xmas rush though
 MSmits: probably because there were very little good alternatives
 Astrobytes: Didn't seem sensible for Pacman imo but hey
 Astrobytes: That was surprising for Xmas Rush 
 MSmits: sometimes having "a search" is better than no search. These contests are often hard to write searches for
 leojean890: OOC for example&#160;;)
 MSmits: yeah, i had a beamsearch for ooc
 leojean890: a good tracker is a good start :p
 MSmits: to path through areas with few mines
 MSmits: but it's only a partial search really
 leojean890: my mine avoidance strategy was weak, that's why I stayed top gold for 10 days not succeeding to reach legend ;P
 MSmits: thats what you have to do sometimes, do one part with heuristics and one part with search
 MSmits: ahhh, that sucks, to be stuck behind gold boss
 Astrobytes: search is search, doesn't always need to be a full game tree search, you might use different types of searches for different stages/situations
 MSmits: I always managed to get past it, but often at the last moment
 leojean890: for 10 days it's sucks yeah^^
 MSmits: yeah Astrobytes
 leojean890: I was like between #15 and #2 gold all the time ;P
 MSmits: was there much rating difference with goild boss?
 MSmits: sometimes the rank doesnt mean all that much
 MSmits: if gold boss is at +3 for example
 leojean890: I sometimes had more than its "min"
 MSmits: ahh ok
 leojean890: he navigates between 28 and 32
 leojean890: and me between 24.5 and 28.5 :P
 leojean890: need big luck xd
 MSmits: I see, then you might have gotten lucky with a RPS spamsubmit thats weak against you and strong against boss
 MSmits: thats how people get pushed into  a league
 leojean890: and with CG bench I had 30-40% winrate against him;)
 MSmits: wow mobility param has a really strong effect on the game in othello
 MSmits: i lowered it a bit and my bot is crap
 MSmits: was at 800, started at 500-600 for refitting and both tests 20% winrate overall
 leojean890: yeah sometimes someone spam submit and some people pass because of him:)
 MSmits: yep
 MSmits: thats how the servers overload sometimes
 MSmits: when someone spam promotes a bunch of players in CSB
 leojean890: hehe
 leojean890: leagues with 30k people&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah
 leojean890: it's a huge mess:p
 MSmits: it doesnt get much attention on chat these days
 MSmits: but before, everyone would always talk about csb
 leojean890: the most popular multi ;P
 leojean890: -3vel became a legend&#160;;)
 MSmits: well mostly because it's connected to the tutorial i think
 leojean890: yes:p
 MSmits: it gets suggested at first
 Astrobytes: That and a certain absent advocate
 leojean890: often, people talk about it in #fr&#160;;)
 MSmits: you mean MK&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: yep
 leojean890: I heard about him
 leojean890: I was not really present in CG at his time ;P
 MSmits: csb is still alive in #fr?
 leojean890: sometimes yeah but depends on who pass&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Yes, pretty much the same here
 leojean890: often new codingamers
 Astrobytes: yep
 eulerscheZahl: fix ur csb
 leojean890: but it's maybe 1 day out of 2&#160;?
 leojean890: idk the exact frequency
 Astrobytes: ezpz euler
 eulerscheZahl: where did MK go? that was his job to say that
 MSmits: yeah I dunno
 MSmits: in my first week on CG he kept asking to teamviewer me :P
 icecream17: errr... what is csb?
 Scarfield: el structo said he was gaming last week, so he is still around, just not advocating CSB anymore
 MSmits: pod racing multi icecream17
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 icecream17: oh that
 eulerscheZahl: once i changed my nick as automaton kept pinging me
 Astrobytes: He quit CG
 leojean890: mdr
 icecream17: automaton2000
 eulerscheZahl: MK didn't realize it was me and PMed me to give advice to CSB
 Automaton2000: the difference between the two
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: literal last words "MadKnight quits"
 leojean890: automaton2000
 Automaton2000: a simulation of the game
 Astrobytes: And not been seen since then
 leojean890: by changing only one character
 leojean890: you gets spammed as well
 MSmits: Astrobytes any specific reason&#160;?
 leojean890: automato2000
 Astrobytes: dbdr showed the chat log last week
 MSmits: I know he hadnt been coding for a long time
 Scarfield: untill he unquits, or some other user starts getting people to play CSB
 Astrobytes: Looked like he got (wait for it): offended
 MSmits: by?
 eulerscheZahl: last contest he tried was mean max i thinknot counting a placement around rank 1000
 Astrobytes: Hard to say, was only mild trolling about CSB from what I could see
 MSmits: ah
 Scarfield: i saw the link, but didnt seem to me that it was anything bad (?)
 Astrobytes: Or about him being a bot
 Astrobytes: Yeah it was very mild trollage
 Astrobytes: I think he was fed up with the CSB association
 Scarfield: TrollagestroBytes
 leojean890: so he PMed you to "teach" automaton bots to say "fix ur csb" 
 Astrobytes: Trollfield
 eulerscheZahl: he's so easy to parodizespellcheck underlines that word, no idea how to write it
 MSmits: no leojean890 AutomatonNN at some point decided to talk to euler all day
 AutomatonNN: why is that a thing about checkers?
 MSmits: so euler got pinged
 MSmits: so euler changed his name to prevent being pinged
 Astrobytes: Just parody euler
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 leojean890: because named automaton&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: and royale had to change his nick permanently because of a contest :D
 leojean890: code royale
 leojean890:&#160;?
 leojean890:&#160;;)
 MSmits: for the best Automaton statement, check eulers profile leojean890
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 leojean890: "eulerscheZahl is a noob" - AutomatonNN
 MSmits: i was there when he said it
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a tutorial on what the problem is that the other ones are always
 MSmits: could not stop laughing :P
 eulerscheZahl: idiot
 leojean890: nice hehe
 Scarfield: wish i was there xD
 MSmits: was in the morning when i was on the train if i recall correctly
 MSmits: best start of the day
 eulerscheZahl: luckily automaton got fixed to some degree and pings me less often now
 eulerscheZahl: as seen above
 MSmits: oh right, he just did it again
 Scarfield: oops
 MSmits: britney spears references, really&#160;?
 Scarfield: xD 
 MSmits: i thought we drew the line at my little pony
 Scarfield: well you got it 
 Scarfield: and she is beyond that line :thinking: 
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: i dunno
 Astrobytes: enough of this Toxic chat
 MSmits:&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Moar Britney
 Scarfield: its bitney "beeach"
 MSmits: imagine MK missing all this
 Astrobytes: We don't have to imagine, he is.
 Astrobytes: (I know what you mean)
 Scarfield: lol
 eulerscheZahl: he managed to turn himself into a meme in the end
 Astrobytes: An interesting life cycle for sure
 Scarfield: 20% helpful 80% "fix it/ ezpz"
 Astrobytes: *70% "fix it", 10% rubberducking/help me with my assignment
 eulerscheZahl: a long time ago, even before Automaton, i suggested to write a MK bot.seems we should do it now, if the real one is gone
 MSmits: yes, do it
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes these numbers don't add up
 MSmits: did you use "+"&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, in base 10
 MSmits: hmm
 <b>**MSmits is stumped</b></p><p><img src="/a/23052489191875" /> Astrobytes: 70% fix it, 20% helpful, 10% rubberducking?
 terragady: is it possible to have higher difficulty on clash of code?
 eulerscheZahl: funny part: it's always base 10, no matter which number system you are using
 terragady: the tasks are super easy
 Scarfield: 10% power of will
 tomatoes: use bash
 DoxLee: how can i look at my last games&#160;?? 
 MSmits: terragady if you want harder tasks, you will need to do something other than clashes
 Astrobytes: Do puzzles instead terragady
 Scarfield: ^
 Astrobytes: Or bot programming, or optimisation
 terragady: but i want to compete with friend :P
 MSmits: you can compete through bot programming
 eulerscheZahl: you can fight them in bot...
 eulerscheZahl: damn
 MSmits: I type with 2 fingers euler
 Astrobytes: And that lasts longer too
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sleepy
 Astrobytes: You too MSmits?!
 MSmits: ah yes, its your bedtime
 MSmits: i never did a typing course
 MSmits: so yeah
 eulerscheZahl: what happened to your other 8 fingers?
 MSmits: thats how i learned
 Astrobytes: Even darkhorse has upgraded to using thumbs
 MSmits: it's just badly learned
 Scarfield: wait, isnt it 41 minutes past your bedtime?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't take a typing course either. invented my own system
 MSmits: there is a big issue with 2 finger typing
 Astrobytes: I learned typing to the soundtrack of... Boney M
 eulerscheZahl: i'm staying up longer in summer. my room is under the roof, too warm to sleep
 MSmits: your hand makes larger movements, so you hit the keyboard a LOT harder
 Astrobytes: Thank you Mrs Hendry&#160;:(
 MSmits: i wake up my wife and daughter typing sometimes :p
 eulerscheZahl: can you type blindly?
 Astrobytes: Me or Smits?
 MSmits: nearly, i correct my hand placement subconsciously every minute or so
 MSmits: if i use a different keyboard, i have problems for a while
 Scarfield: you wake them up, do you mean you type with your fists, not fingers?
 MSmits: or am sitting in a different position
 eulerscheZahl: only 1 way to find out: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play.typeracer.com?rt=sc2v8x79u">https://play.typeracer.com?rt=sc2v8x79u</a>
 MSmits: Scarfield it sounds like fistst
 Astrobytes: I usually type without looking, depending on pain meds status lol
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: ok one time euler
 Astrobytes: And I have a loud keyboard
 Astrobytes: Satisfyingly loud
 MSmits: mmh 55 to 59
 eulerscheZahl: we are both slow :D
 MSmits: i got stuck on the word forever
 MSmits: had to retype it twice
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, you had a lead
 MSmits: thats what happens when i misplace my hand on the keyboard
 MSmits: some words i type super fast and others i get stuck 
 Astrobytes: Hm, that's a late-morning exercise for me I think lol
 Scarfield: how do you type "stewardesse" MSmits?
 eulerscheZahl: yet i constantly beat you on the chat Astrobytes
 MSmits: Scarfield, poorly
 MSmits: with 1 finger
 Scarfield: the longest word only typed with the left hand 
 Scarfield: nice&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and i have to put more thoughts in my wording, would be easier for me in German
 Astrobytes: Don't mock the afflicted eulerscheZahl :P
 MSmits: do you think it's possible for me to be better with 10 fingers than with 2 if i typed this way for 20 years?
 eulerscheZahl: missisippi is fun to type as well
 Astrobytes: Maybe, but if you can type fast enough with 2 then crack on
 MSmits: yeah for now
 eulerscheZahl: obviously you need to switch to Dvorak first
 MSmits: maybe if i get older i could get some repetitive strain injuries
 Astrobytes: Works fine for darkhorse using two fingers (and recently thumbs as stated)
 MSmits: oh he upgraded recently?
 Astrobytes: Yes. Stopped using his ankles too.
 MSmits: actually i do use a thumb for space bar
 eulerscheZahl: my spacebar is worn up on one side, almost new on the other
 eulerscheZahl: always using the left thumb for space
 MSmits: Astrobytes what did he do with his ankles?
 Scarfield: type loudly
 Astrobytes: lol, it was a mistranslation, he'd hurt his wrists typing but stated ankles instead
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: It was too good to ever forget
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Scarfield: lol my spacebar is actually as well, but on the right side. would have thought the left took most of the beating from gaming
 MSmits: so far I only get issues with too much mouse clicking
 MSmits: keyboard has never hurt me so far
 Astrobytes: My keyboard is fine
 Astrobytes: And I use it all day every day, well, most
 Astrobytes: Needs a clean though
 eulerscheZahl: i got pretty good at using autocomplete in the IDE.typing those letters that i can reach easily, omitting the others
 Astrobytes: Visual Studio is nice in that way
 eulerscheZahl: now it is
 Astrobytes: Yeah, indeed!
 MSmits: do you mean the CG IDE eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: MonoDevelop had that earlier i think (to that extend)
 MSmits: since it was changed
 eulerscheZahl: i don't use the CG IDE
 MSmits: i thought maybe for puzzles
 MSmits: I use it for that
 eulerscheZahl: ssorem =&gt; StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries
 Astrobytes: I use it for some puzzles and quick edits
 MSmits: when i load up oware these days, it takes like a full minute
 MSmits: the C++ language assist I think&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Ah not just me then
 eulerscheZahl: illedan reported something like that too
 eulerscheZahl: on discord
 Astrobytes: SAme for a few multis, even without long text strings
 Astrobytes: btw, did any CGers do the ICFP contest?
 eulerscheZahl: i registered, decided against after seeing the task
 Astrobytes: Looked like some reverse engineering thingy when I checked it Friday
 Astrobytes: Didn't follow it
 eulerscheZahl: my first thought: implement some kind of interpreter for their own madeup language
 eulerscheZahl: like processor opcode
 eulerscheZahl: didn't check if that turned out to be true in the end.they only had half the rules revealed at the start
 eulerscheZahl: defining numbers, math operators
 eulerscheZahl: so i expected branches, conditions and such
 Astrobytes: That looked like the thing to do yeah, but the changing ruleset put me off even going near it
 eulerscheZahl: that too. and the lengthy statement just to decide if i like it
 eulerscheZahl: to me a good game has a short statement yet a high complexity
 Astrobytes: Concept was fine I guess, didn't need to be so wordy
 tomatoes: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know. TL;DR
 tomatoes: easy to learn hard to master
 eulerscheZahl: to enter*
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, just realised my offline Othello runner was only using 50 out of 150 ms&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: (in 'CG' mode)

 pedrosorio: beating _python_ at their own game
 pedrosorio: hmm
 pedrosorio: tfw you spend 2 minutes in "shortest" clash and you're like "can't optimize it further, submit"
 pedrosorio: oof, got beaten there
 pedrosorio: well played @TLun
 Dlx: why is the clash chat closed just when you get to results, that's when you have time to chat...
 Dlx: annoying
 pedrosorio: lol yeah
 pedrosorio: 22 seconds
 pedrosorio: best time ever
 Dlx: and why can't I get to finish my code when the clash is over, come on... I bet 95% of people here care most about solving it, not really winning it... so unsatisfying that i copied my code and finished it in a  jupyter notebook lol
 pedrosorio: that's pretty lame, they should let you go back
 Dlx: yep..
 pedrosorio: and run the test cases
 Dlx: hello admin, fix it ;p
 Dlx: I just staret codingame, it's pretty fun :D just bitchin about some minor stuff...
 Dlx: isn't there a suggestion box here...

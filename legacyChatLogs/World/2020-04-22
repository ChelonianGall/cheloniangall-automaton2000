 WINWINWIN: Has anyone got their codinpoints for ocean of code as a multi?
 AntiSquid: doesn't show up for me
 abhay_RAJ: hello
 cthoughtz: Hello
 Neoncamouflage: Hello
 cthoughtz: I am trying to figure out this problem in kotlin. I am preparing for an interview and I am not use to these algorithms to be honest.
 cthoughtz: I have been struggling with it all night. 
 cthoughtz: Has anywone done The Descent in kotlin?
 MadKnight: there is solution given in hints
 AntiSquid: hello
 Quidome: good morning
 Quidome: I am doing the Bender-Episode 1 and only the first testcase fails on submit does anyone has the testcase for me
 AntiSquid: click setting on the left and then expert mode and then i think you can look at the individual test cases in the IDE&#160;?
 AntiSquid: b
 AntiSquid: ah i see now, at the bottom click the 3 lines and you can then see individual test cases 
 Uljahn: i guess he means validators
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: but he said test cases so ...
 Uljahn: "on submit"
 Quidome: Yes, the validation cases
 Quidome: the first one
 Quidome: :D
 AntiSquid: Uljahn will help you
 Quidome: :thumbsup:
 Uljahn: :confused:
 Uljahn: i'll help you if you're on python
 Uljahn: also this could be helpful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bender-episode-1/discuss">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/bender-episode-1/discuss</a>
 Quidome: thnxs&#160;:)
 Quidome: I am on Rust
 Quidome: Everything works except the first validator. So that's in this case hard to find
 AntiSquid: but how can you fail on that one when everything else works?
 AntiSquid: validator says "Simple moves" so i guess you are searching for an obstacle or try to avoid an obstacle that doesn't exist 
 pol34: Hi!  do someone know if there is a game using python and SQL&#160;?? 
 aCat: what do you mean?
 aCat: you can use any available language for your solution
 Uljahn: afaik there is no sql-oriented puzzles for python on codingame, but you can practice numpy and pandas
 pol34: Okay thank you!
 Mentalist: This chat is active!
 AntiSquid: why sql pol34&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: Hi, I am using a random element in my codingame sponsored puzzle, is it fair if I spam submit to get a higher score?
 AntiSquid: if you click the searchbar at the top of the site and type in SQL you can see links to some playgrounds, but to practice SQL you should try a different site
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN is it fair when others do it?
 HotSausageOfPower_223f: Because I wanted to practice a little..
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN spam submits like everyone else lol
 WINWINWIN: was going to, now will stay at 1284 points&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: pol34 then try diff site, lots out there
 HotSausageOfPower_223f: yes i will do it thank you&#160;!
 Crypticsy: hey! umm can you guys give me  feedback on my puzzle?
 Crypticsy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/497385b5a52bd71c954079fb45667ba73b8e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/497385b5a52bd71c954079fb45667ba73b8e</a>
 aCat: I will try to do this later today
 aCat: Seems interesting, although i would vote for medium
 TheNinjaGiant_da40: hi 
 MSmits: anyone on who wrote a Onitama bot?
 Scarfield: nope, but got "vanilla" SmitsiMax to work for CSB yesterday&#160;:)
 MSmits: great! Including the blocker?
 MSmits: that seems to be the hard part for people
 Scarfield: only the search itself so far, no pruning, optmisation or blocker eval yet
 MSmits: ahh ok, well good progress 
 Scarfield: has the font in the IDE been changed?
 MSmits: no idea, it's a just a place where i paste my code
 MSmits: about Onitama, I was just wondering if anyone else thought it is weird that the card moves dy is defined as positive upwards
 darkhorse64: MSmits: I wrote one
 MSmits: so did you run into that issue?
 MSmits: I was stuck for a while until I realized I had to negate my y coord
 MSmits: my dy i mean
 darkhorse64: sec. reading my code
 MSmits: yay my moves work and my card state transitions too. I got past the 64 bit state insanity bugs&#160;:)
 MSmits: now the rest of the bot
 MSmits: at least it seems to work. I didnt get to test capturing and winning yet
 MSmits: I just did this test:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eefbf3bd-69bd-41f0-8d9a-4b82af53f604">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eefbf3bd-69bd-41f0-8d9a-4b82af53f604</a>
 darkhorse64: Actually, I do not have this problem because I wrote a table for all possible moves for all cards in the game. I do not use the inputs except for the cardId
 MSmits: ohh I do read the cardid
 MSmits: I create this table too, but on the first update
 MSmits: i mean i do read the dx and dy
 MSmits: it's just weird because anything else in CG has y increasing downwards
 MSmits: when i first got to CG I was confused the other way around. For example with Thor
 darkhorse64: Same. OpenGL has its origin bottom left
 Scarfield: yea i just started using row,col instead of x,y 
 MSmits: ahh, for me it was just coming from basic math x, y graphs
 MSmits: ohh that row col thing uttt has is also super confusing
 MSmits: i keep reading it wrong
 darkhorse64: Yes. Math also is bottom left
 MSmits: my expansion function is over 100 lines for onitama :P
 darkhorse64: In my first ever CG contest, I mixed x,y and top, bottom for a few hours. The bot was somewhat "working" nevertheless 
 MSmits: not sure if it is because of my weird state representation or because the game is complicated
 Scarfield: the angle being measured positive in the opposite direction in CSB messed with me though, forgot to convert my result from the search back, until i noticed my pods where simply turning in the wrong direction
 MSmits: lol
 darkhorse64: expansion like expand in MCTS&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah that happens to everyone Scarfield
 MSmits: darkhorse64 yes
 MSmits: well mostly just move generation
 MSmits: which is what expansion is
 MSmits: if you'd have a minimax, you'd be doing this too
 MSmits: the thing is, you have 2 cards, 2 types and some exceptions for capturing and winning
 MSmits: but probably I also have some extra lines to compress and decompress the state into and out of the uint64_t
 darkhorse64: I did bitboarding but used more space. My hand is stored outside the bitboard. My code is simple and quite short   
 MSmits: yeah, I might end up paying for this choice. Not sure what the speed of it will be
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/01785522-4d21-4b79-a080-40373489cc82">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/01785522-4d21-4b79-a080-40373489cc82</a>
 MSmits: yes but thats play movre
 MSmits: how do you know what moves are available?
 MSmits: thats where most of my code is
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e409d8d9-f91c-4ac1-bd3b-2f3b3edf82ef">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e409d8d9-f91c-4ac1-bd3b-2f3b3edf82ef</a>
 MSmits: very similar to mine, but I have the master and the cardstate in there too
 MSmits: it's a few extra operations
 MSmits: the only real reason for it is hashing. I want to be able to have an easy time testing transpositions
 MSmits: with a few dead knights, you're talking about maybe a million possible states total, many unreachable, so transpositions should happen
 Hovsep: Hi,why is there only 15 people online&#160;?
 MSmits: in worldchat Hovsep
 Hovsep: I thought it was a wellknown website
 MSmits: it is
 MSmits: there are other channels
 MSmits: #fr
 MSmits: also some talk on discord
 Hovsep: Same persons as in world
 MSmits: it's a bit fragmented
 Hovsep: I see
 darkhorse64: We have just finished a contest also everyone is exhausted 
 MSmits: also, you can work on cG related stuff without even being online
 MSmits: thousands of people were in that contest
 MSmits: the amount of players doing CG in between contests is much smaller
 Hovsep: Oh I didn't know that
 MSmits: also, people who do CG may be online 1-2 hrs a day, different timezones etc.
 Hovsep: Thank's for your precise answer
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: What I don't get is how you manage your hand with 5 bits
 MSmits: allright
 MSmits: so you have 5 cards right
 MSmits: there's 5 ways to pick the first card
 MSmits: there;s 4 ways to pick the second
 MSmits: all states happen twice
 MSmits: so 10 ways for the first player to have a set of cards
 MSmits: then there's 3 ways to pick the rest of the cards (because the center card is the variable)
 MSmits: so 3 * 10 = 30 cardstates
 MSmits: 30 &lt; 5 bit
 MSmits: well you need 5 bit obviously
 MSmits: but you could have fit 32 cardstates if you wanted to
 MSmits: actually I have 2 leftover bits, so i could fit 128&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: OK. I need to think about it because I thought there were many more arrangements. I have to go back to my real work
 MSmits: there are many more arrangements, but many are equivalent
 MSmits: it doesnt matter if a card is your first or your second
 MSmits: as long as you can use it
 MSmits: allright, go workie&#160;:)
 MSmits: I'll go try and move some wizards and knights
 MSmits: will be a while before it works completely
 darkhorse64: You have the moves, the mcts,. WHat's missing&#160;?
 Hovsep: Do you guys have a good IA fight challenge to advice&#160;? 
 Hovsep: Except Coders Strike Back
 darkhorse64: Do you like board games&#160;?
 Hovsep: Yes
 Hovsep: But i'd prefer something else than a board game ia
 Hovsep: if possible
 MSmits: darkhorse64 the mcts is different yet again. Every of my games does stuff differently with playerIndices and signs. So i always run into bugs
 MSmits: also i need a good eval
 darkhorse64: Go for Yavalath. It's a nice game on its own and interesting to code
 darkhorse64: Fantastic bits if you like qquidditch
 Hovsep: I'm a beginner, is it something where i can learn new things&#160;?
 MSmits: that's an oddly specific hobby :P
 MSmits: Hovsep board games are the easiest to start with I think if you want to do real computation heavy tree searches
 MSmits: if you're just looking to build an AI with heuristics, code a la mode would be cool
 MSmits: btw, dont do yavalath if you're beginner
 MSmits: even though it is a great game
 darkhorse64: I rehash my mcts on and on. Of course, the game interface changes each time  depending on move generation and win/lose conditions but it does not vary too much. So it goes fast for me
 Hovsep: Legends of Code and magic is it good for a beginner&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah I know, but somehow I dont manage this darkhorse64. The problem is also, that the input is different for each game. Somehow I build on this input and my mcts ends up being different
 Hovsep: I know the language C
 MSmits: Hovsep it's not good for beginner i would say
 Hovsep: hahah
 MSmits: takes a lot of code to even get started
 Hovsep: It seems like Codingame is for real experimented programmers
 MSmits: not really
 MSmits: coding bots is
 MSmits: but you can also solve puzzles
 MSmits: also there are some exceptions, we have many multis, some do a really good job of helping you get started
 Cappefra: go into the "practice" session and start with the easy ones
 Cappefra: tbh it's more about being good at algorithms rather than coding per se
 MSmits: to do CG, you basically need to understand your language is all
 Hovsep: Ok thank you, i'll practice in easy 
 MSmits: but C might be a bit hard in and of itself, because it is not exactly coder-friendly
 MSmits: old language
 MSmits: better to start with python, java, C# etc.
 Hovsep: yea but i really like it, i'll try another language after mastering completly the C
 Cappefra: that'll take a while hahaha
 MSmits: kk, just dont get frustrated and quit because of the language. C# can be a lot of fun and you can do easy puzzles in 10-15 mins each once you get used to them
 MSmits: but not in C i think
 MSmits: CG can be a lot of fun I mean
 MSmits: well C# too :P
 MSmits: C++ could be a good choice for you too Hovsep, it's basically C with classes, but also many other things. But even C++ is much harder to use for this than the languages i mentioned
 Hovsep: I'm learning C++,C# and Java at school but i did'nt practice a lot
 Uljahn: Hovsep: you can read the forum topics (feedback and strategy) to learn new algorithms or just get some hints on most multis, also you can look at community solutions after you finished a puzzle
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: might wanna try C#, you will learn it quickly
 auguluk: hey
 MSmits: also Visual studio is an awesome C# IDE
 Hovsep: Ok thank you guys forthe help
 MSmits: just for the IDE, the language is great
 auguluk: I aggre
 MSmits: np
 Hovsep: Yea i have it MSmits
 MSmits: cool
 andichin: hello guys
 MSmits: hbi
 MSmits: hi also
 AntiSquid: rust is new meta, auto timeout if opponent wants to optimize vs your bot
 mark7: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/119615321230c8b4faa117bc4d00b49899677ff">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/119615321230c8b4faa117bc4d00b49899677ff</a>
 AntiSquid: mark7 don't post clash links here
 cegprakash: how to view only console and game and hide the code on the right side
 cegprakash: it's better to view the console on right and game on left
 AntiSquid: you could get CG enhancer and edit it to your liking i guess
 AntiSquid: actually cg enhancer has that by default, nevermind, cegprakash
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453969655">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453969655</a>
 cegprakash: bad random
 cegprakash: i'll add this to my mutate condition
 cegprakash: lets see if it fixes
 eulerscheZahl: is that still silver?
 eulerscheZahl: are are moving along the edge. be the snail in the center to remain hidden longer
 eulerscheZahl: and your mine triggers seem random to be, do you even have the slightest chance to hit your opponent?
 MartijnH: Cryptic question; cause i do not want to spoil anything..Did anyone here solve the "ss_con" statemachine? do you remember; did they make a mistake with regards tot the natural form??
 eulerscheZahl: i only solved ss_n, rs_n, ss_f, gs_m, ss_m&#160;:/
 MartijnH: too bad.. I think you could solve rs_colv aswell.. easier than gs_m
 Cappefra: shadows of the night 2 is a real bitch
 MartijnH: Cappefra.. is that a cryptic answer?
 MartijnH: aha.. I see.  I will try that one after this
 Cappefra: I can't go over 75% atm, and I even know why but implementing the right solution requires a bunch of refactoring
 MartijnH: did you solve ss_con?
 Cappefra: what is that?
 MartijnH: i think its called puzzle breach
 Cappefra: oh ok no I haven't tried it, shadows of the night 2 is my first very hard
 MartijnH: can I enroll another.. without losing the current progress?
 Cappefra: yeah it saves your code when you "play all tests"
 Cappefra: then you can change language, solve any other puzzle, whatever. That combination of puzzle+language is saved
 MartijnH: ok thx.. good to know
 K4Mx: how to share code with friends&#160;? is it directly online&#160;? 
 jacek: huh? try pastebin or something
 K4Mx: ah so the online platform does not suport sharing code&#160;? 
 K4Mx: multi edit and save ie 
 MSmits: K4Mx CG is a social platform, but all contests, puzzles, etc. are supposed to be solo-coded
 K4Mx: alright thx 
 MSmits: you can share ideas, maybe the occasional function, but you're not supposed to share full code
 MSmits: if you want to code together on something, I recommend repl.it
 K4Mx: ah ok but we kinda fell in love with codingame xD
 MSmits: it's great
 MSmits: btw
 MSmits: what you can do is
 MSmits: fight clashes and turn code sharing on, they'll see your code after the battle
 K4Mx: you mean vs friends
 MSmits: yeah
 K4Mx: nice ok 
 mark7: MSmits up for a clash?
 MSmits: well my random move bot is finally working
 MSmits: eh no I dont clash. but write an UTTT bot, get to legend and fight me there
 K4Mx: its clash of code right&#160;? 
 MSmits: yes
 K4Mx: ok thx
 eulerscheZahl: just invite him
 MSmits: euler look it's working
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/453981136">https://www.codingame.com/replay/453981136</a>
 MSmits: it still plays stupid but i worked out all the crazy bit-bugs
 eulerscheZahl: it's alive!
 eulerscheZahl: producing valid moves
 MSmits: yeah!
 eulerscheZahl: and even killing his boss with yours
 MSmits: well thats a lucky win, boss wins more&#160;:)
 MSmits: my master tends to go out there and suicide
 eulerscheZahl: did you notice that the image above the endscreen changes depending on the outcome?
 MSmits: btw, a sizable fraction of syntax bugs in this bot was me writing wizard and master interchangably and getting confused
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and the student knights
 MSmits: i call them knights and masters now
 MSmits: not very consistent
 MSmits: but what did you mean with the image
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/s425rs">https://prnt.sc/s425rs</a>blue wins
 MSmits: oh thats variable. Nice touch
 MSmits: btw, I also got confused when you made the y-coord increase upwards
 MSmits: i mean its on the visual representation, but i am so used to Y going down that I did not notice it
 eulerscheZahl: to match the chessboard image i stole from checkers
 MSmits: yeah it's fine, it just got me stuck for a while
 eulerscheZahl: me too
 MSmits: easily fixed with a minus sign
 MSmits: well thats a relief, that you did it to yourself also :P
 eulerscheZahl: seemed so easy to code the game
 eulerscheZahl: but i repeatedly screwed up
 MSmits: the card orientation seems the hardest
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: my turn update function is 150 lines :P
 MSmits: just reading the input and figuring out what the new gamestate is
 eulerscheZahl: my hole bot is only 3x your input reading
 MSmits: it's because I have only 30 card states. I get rid of the duplicate ones (aka, having card 0 and 1 or having card 1 and 0)
 MSmits: my card ordering is fixed so I need several loops to figure out how my cardstate system corresponds to the input
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: well once the search is running the problem is gone, but conversions are often tricky
 MSmits: I use 3 coordinate systems for uttt 
 MSmits: in the same bot
 MSmits: 4 if you count the input system
 eulerscheZahl: you should try mean max. you can apply polar coords on it
 MSmits: haha yeah
 MSmits: that's cool
 K4Mx: cannot use the middle card&#160;?  
 MSmits: do people do that?
 eulerscheZahl: they were planned as the official input but CG vetoed it
 MSmits: K4Mx nope
 eulerscheZahl: but you will get it after your action
 K4Mx: wow this is hard as fuck but cool challenge
 K4Mx: can you pick it or its random&#160;? 
 MSmits: what do you mean pick it?
 MSmits: pick what?
 K4Mx: this versus game
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: there are many multiplayer arenas
 MSmits: you can do what you like
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>43 arenas
 K4Mx: ah so you can versus in bot programing too&#160;? 
 MSmits: yes, but it is asynchronous
 K4Mx: not only pve 
 K4Mx: ok thx good to know
 MSmits: no it is mostly pvp
 MSmits: you play against bots players submitted before
 K4Mx: ok i want my friend bot
 MSmits: but there is a pve boss in the lower leagues, all except the highest league
 eulerscheZahl: and in 2 weeks we have a contest again with about 2000 players competing
 MSmits: yea
 K4Mx: we dont have the skills for that 
 mark7: Spring Challenge
 K4Mx: = ) 
 MSmits: sometimes the contests dont require much skill to get started
 eulerscheZahl: there are some really strong players but also a lot of beginners competing
 jacek: cards were hard in onitama. and confusing, given for the other player they are upsie down
 MSmits: but you wont rank high of course
 mark7: Yes, 
 ZarthaxX: has someone ever used avx here? D:
 ZarthaxX: robostac&#160;?
 MSmits: several
 K4Mx: so challenge are known beforehand context&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: did robo even submit there?
 MSmits: I used it once, it worked, but i did not get an improvement
 ZarthaxX: its not about improvement tho
 MSmits: robo uses it, marchete, re curse
 MSmits: probably a lot more
 K4Mx: context*
 ZarthaxX: my code compiled with -mavx2 flag crashes
 eulerscheZahl: the theme is known K4Mx: pacman
 K4Mx: contest*
 eulerscheZahl: but not the game
 ZarthaxX: it's super weird
 MSmits: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: watch the video, that's all we know <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2020</a>
 ZarthaxX: its not using avx stuff
 MSmits: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops", "omit-frame-pointer", "inline")
 MSmits: every bot of mine has this
 ZarthaxX: like it crashes at some dynamic allocation part
 ZarthaxX: that makes it compile with avx?
 ZarthaxX: right i will add a target flaxc and check with a debugger
 K4Mx: unknown challenge ok thx 
 MSmits: yeah, well it worked anyway
 ZarthaxX: hope that works
 K4Mx: only educated guess possible xD
 eulerscheZahl: definitely not enough to start coding now&#160;;)
 MSmits: K4Mx btw, you may have to try several multiplayer arenas before you find one thats easy enough to get started in
 K4Mx: onitama appeals to me but maybe its too hard yes
 MSmits: they vary greatly in skill requirement  to get started
 MSmits: onitama is moderate
 K4Mx: also we are not devs
 eulerscheZahl: you can try connect4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8292209ca950fe69e9ab715bad4fb1d99a7d8c</a>
 K4Mx: and learning language
 MSmits: I am not a dev either, but I coded a lot
 linjoehan: NUMBER SHIFTING has 500 levels&#160;?
 K4Mx: tried clojure but to collab we will pick another
 eulerscheZahl: it has 1000 levels
 eulerscheZahl: but top players agreed on a tie
 K4Mx: no sorry connec4 is boring = ) 
 K4Mx: id rather grind on moderate
 MSmits: K4Mx btw, if you really want to collab on a low level league of a multi, it's not so bad. Just remember that if you get good you're not supposed to share code
 jacek: :o
 linjoehan: huh agreed on a tie? so there are more levels but they don't want to chase it?
 K4Mx: i see, samurai hide their skills xD
 MSmits: also, dont submit the code twice
 MSmits: if you collab and you both submit, it might flag you as cheating
 wlesavo: they shouldve solve another one not to confuse people :slight_smile:
 MSmits: i mean twice on different accounts
 eulerscheZahl: submit under 2 accounts is what MSmits means
 wlesavo: but on the other hand round number
 MSmits: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i'm slow
 jacek: yes
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo i'm not sure anymore if you asked for it too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/cd81cbed2f30b8b14b7912e8ac37e2ff50735/contest-tools-and-workflow/setting-up-the-ide">https://tech.io/playgrounds/cd81cbed2f30b8b14b7912e8ac37e2ff50735/contest-tools-and-workflow/setting-up-the-ide</a>
 eulerscheZahl: oh, bad link. not even the beginning
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl oh, thx, i did
 eulerscheZahl: no mark7 i won't clash with you
 mark7: haha, come on
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, i can't code
 eulerscheZahl: just here for chatting
 MSmits: mark7 don't pick on the newbies
 mark7: eulerscheZahl MSmits You both are legends, IM a NOOB
 MSmits: I'm a guru, not a legend
 mark7: Okay GURUJI
 mark7: :joy:
 jacek: senpai~
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: taking a break before I try to fix the mcts part of my code
 eulerscheZahl: you have a typo in minimax
 MSmits: lol
 wlesavo: mctmits
 jacek: mcts in onitama? w00t/
 MSmits: why not?
 jacek: i guess everything can be done with mcts if youre brave enough
 MSmits: doesnt darkhorse use mcts?
 MSmits: I also think kar liso doesnt know minimax very well... or at least I think that is what he said
 MSmits: so he might be doing mcts as well
 eulerscheZahl: by his message i would say it's a minimax
 eulerscheZahl: he prints a depth
 MSmits: hm ok
 MSmits: makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: but sure, try MCTS
 MSmits: what features makes you think minimax is better btw?
 jacek: why it says both are defeated? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453986734">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/453986734</a>
 jacek: well im using minimax. im 3rd so the eval is at least not crap
 MSmits: no, i mean. what part of the game makes you feel like minimax might be better than mcts. Even if you're not sure. I am just curious
 eulerscheZahl: because it's a tie and i was too lazy for a good message
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it's just that i understand minimax better
 MSmits: you use it often
 jacek: maybe i see cheese board i think minimax
 MSmits: personally I think you can use mcts anywhere you can use minimax as long as you can get enough rollouts. Minimax eval can also be used on mcts
 MSmits: makes sense jacek
 MSmits: btw my checkers bot is also a mcts. All it does is count pieces
 MSmits: as an eval
 MSmits: otherwise it would do better I think
 MSmits: i was thinking of starting with a knight count as eval for onitama
 MSmits: and add stuff later
 MSmits: no idea what
 eulerscheZahl: do you weight men and kings differently at least?
 MSmits: I think a bit
 MSmits: or maybe double
 MSmits: not sure
 jacek: well they found mcts is quite suitable for checkers
 jacek: given the forced moves
 MSmits: I lost motivation when it was time to get a good eval
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: well even on chess, doest Alpha zero use mcts characteristics?
 MSmits: doesnt
 MSmits: except without the random i guess
 jacek: yes, but also strong NN for eval. mcts was poor for chess before alpha zero
 MSmits: yeah eval seems to factor in. 
 MSmits: weird that you cant use those minimax evals for a mcts bot in chess
 MSmits: maybe it just doesnt get enough rollouts
 MSmits: might not be accurate enough
 MSmits: nn eval is very accurate
 pb4: I'm not a specialist for those evals
 pb4: but there's an important requirement for a MCTS eval that is absolutely not a requirement for minimax
 MSmits: guidance?
 pb4: for MCTS it must make sense to add and average two evaluations
 andichin: ur mom has big gei lol
 MSmits: ah right
 pb4: for minimax, you don't care
 MSmits: thats why mcts does badly on trappy games
 pb4: You just need a proper ordering
 MSmits: where 1 move is good and all the rest is crap
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: still wondering how onitama fits into this though
 MSmits: the fact that it is very nearly solvable should also factor in
 MSmits: there's at most 10^12 available gamestates in an onitama game
 MSmits: similar to oware
 MSmits: checkers is like 10^20 or more
 wlesavo: pb4 hey, wanted to ask you, when approximately you came up with 8th version of ooc bot, gold or early legend?
 pb4: somewhere mid gold
 wlesavo: thx
 pb4: Why that question&#160;?
 pb4: Other versions were minor improvements on the immovable references like egaetan and mchl12
 wlesavo: just some retrospective
 wlesavo: immovable?
 eulerscheZahl: non submitting
 reCurse: immutable&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 reCurse: Ah I missed the const reference opportunity
 reCurse: Oh well
 pb4: :D
 darkhorse64: my bot is an mcts with an eval
 pb4: immobile
 pb4: well you got the point :D
 MSmits: thought so darkhorse64, do you random rollout or just immediately eval after expansion like i do in oware?
 reCurse: Random rollout never works on any sensible game
 reCurse: Wait that worked for go
 reCurse: Nevermind
 reCurse: Though it was heavy rollouts
 wlesavo: heavy means using heuristics for moves?
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: in yavalath it means not considering insta-loss moves, always taking insta-win moves and some others
 jacek: welp for new game i make mechanics
 jacek: i have already mcts and minimax 'frameworks' done
 jacek: and just see which one is better
 jacek: obviously mcts is better than minimax without any eval
 MSmits: sounds smart, but there are are some features that may change the balance later
 MSmits: like in those rare cases where transpositions are good
 MSmits: you might favor minimax more then
 jacek: then i compare simple eval with mcts, then fine-tunes mcts, then fine-tune eval etc.
 MSmits: ah ok
 darkhorse64: 1 depth rollouts
 MSmits: like in oware
 jacek: having good eval should be easy to incorporate in mcts, but mostly i have worse results than fine-tuned minimax
 MSmits: both algorithms have a bit of a learning curve though, you could be moderate with one and expert with the other
 MSmits: I am definitely better with mcts
 MSmits: i dont mean their vanilla versions obviously
 MSmits: i mean all the little things you can do to make them better
 jacek: well i was lately mastering minimax. it is not only eval, but also search extentions, pruning
 jacek: in chess null-move heuristic, in other games something else
 MSmits: yes quiescence search 
 MSmits: and such
 MSmits: killer move
 MSmits: null move has issues doesn't it
 MSmits: it breaks the tree a bit
 jacek: you trade some accuracy with deeper tree
 MSmits: yeah, but that "some accuracy" is pretty horrifying to me
 MSmits: you cant even run a solver anymore
 MSmits: i believe that it improves bots, i just dont like it :0
 reCurse: Says the inventor of smitsimax
 MSmits: well i would never use that on a boardgame. These physics games arent solvable anyway&#160;:)
 MSmits: smitsimax is just my way of creating some kind of order in the chaos of games like that.
 MSmits: I much prefer board games
 reCurse: You're still trading for accuracy in horrible ways
 reCurse: Besides didn't you use smitsimax in XR
 MSmits: oh yeah, but I am somehow more accepting of that fact with a game like that
 MSmits: and it horrified me (read my PM :P)
 MSmits: taking a break for real now. ttyl
 icecream17: I just typed "board.players.me.pegs.push( [input] )". Is this long chained thing acceptable...?
 eulerscheZahl: twixt-pp?
 eulerscheZahl: btw jacek i still wait for you submit in this game
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl Illedan I never thanked you for your game
 Zenoscave: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, i don't keep track on who does
 eulerscheZahl: and my contribution was the smallest among the 3 creators named
 Zenoscave: Ah yes And G-Rom thank you as well
 Zenoscave: I tend to forge the third sadly
 eulerscheZahl: and i enjoyed the contest too, so my motivation was partially egositic
 Zenoscave: egositic?
 AntiSquid: weird, ocean of code multi points don't show up for me when i click on my ranking
 eulerscheZahl: selfish
 Zenoscave: egoistic
 eulerscheZahl: oh, a typo
 Zenoscave: Still no points Anti?
 eulerscheZahl: didn't notice
 AntiSquid: no
 eulerscheZahl: but you forgot the t at "forget" :P
 Zenoscave: I thought you just knew an english word I didn't. I wouldn't be surprised
 AntiSquid: but seems like others have it
 Zenoscave: I got mine
 eulerscheZahl: i'm good at making up new words that sound like english
 Zenoscave: it's a good skill. Shakespear also had the skill
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are still submittingany improvements?
 Zenoscave: Small ones. 
 Zenoscave: I have a statistics class I am using  OOC for
 eulerscheZahl: as a student or tutor?
 stacked: how do you do the one where you replace the 0 with -
 Zenoscave: Seeing if sacrificing accuracy for timeout prevention is worthwhile in legend. Student
 stacked: the bot does it in 11 chars in bash
 stacked: i was thinkingreadsed s/0/-/g
 Zenoscave: tr 0 -
 eulerscheZahl: how long till your graduation?
 stacked: but how about the N
 stacked: @Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: read;tr 0 -
 stacked: ohhhhh
 stacked: thanks
 Zenoscave: i graduate in December. just finishing small classes i put off now
 eulerscheZahl: the end is near
 Zenoscave: Very
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: play a game in the IDE for OOC points
 eulerscheZahl: you get the points darkhorse64
 eulerscheZahl: just not shown on your profile
 Zenoscave: AntiSquid see above
 darkhorse64: Yes, only after playing a game in the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: same for crystal rush
 dbdr: AntiSquid just play one OOC game in the IDE
 dbdr: and it will show up
 eulerscheZahl: i did that yesterday already btw&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you pinged the wrong player darkhorse64
 Zenoscave: lol
 darkhorse64: oops
 AntiSquid: you need to do it the day before eh&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i missed a joke telling someone else that it wasn't me&#160;:(
 dbdr: no it's immediate AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: like instant noodles :o
 eulerscheZahl: like a CSB submit
 Zenoscave: lol CSB
 CacheCoherence: yo how do you fill the job application form again? It popped up a while ago
 CacheCoherence: or rather the job notice thingy
 Zenoscave: it shows up when you increase in level I believe
 MadKnight: they're mostly french
 Zenoscave: I may be wrong
 CacheCoherence: Oh so theres no way to do it again?
 AntiSquid: you can go to any page on CG and click GET A JOB at the top to fillin your details
 CacheCoherence: Thanks! AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: but you also need a unique avatar that doesn't scare people when they test against you in the IDE CacheCoherence
 Zenoscave: who is that directed at for the scary pic?
 AntiSquid: also anime avatars have +5% chance at job offers 
 CacheCoherence: AntiSquid will make sure to have onePunch Man
 AntiSquid: awesome
 CacheCoherence: have y'all got any offers lol
 AntiSquid: look this guy has one punch man and got a job at CGI because of it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/b6b3d2af46caf704ac2bf95c40920e9e4520031">https://www.codingame.com/profile/b6b3d2af46caf704ac2bf95c40920e9e4520031</a>
 Zenoscave: no but I'm not in France and Like MK said most offers are french
 AntiSquid: i am sure they might expand in a decade or so
 CacheCoherence: AntiSquid surely the avatar got him the 200 rank
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: increased win rate
 CacheCoherence: + hax from the devs
 Illedan: You've won a CodinGame t-shirt!
 AntiSquid: :tada:
 CacheCoherence: :tada"
 CacheCoherence: :tada:
 AntiSquid: still no avatar and you fail a tada emote in chat, your job opportunities seem to be diminishing
 eulerscheZahl: you have enough CG tshirts already Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: is it still the glitched cube or did they fix it?
 CacheCoherence: damn i have failed
 CacheCoherence: No diss AntiSquid but is that a cow's close up as your avatar?
 eulerscheZahl: and there's no emoji in the subject? no&#160;:)&#160;? what about :tshirt:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: yes, we all live in a cow's close up
 eulerscheZahl: :shirt:
 CacheCoherence: :milk:
 AntiSquid: CacheCoherence here's more details about the cow's close up we live in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster</a>
 CacheCoherence: Damn that sure looks 'milky'
 CacheCoherence: ba dum tisss
 CacheCoherence: F
 Illedan: Yeah, I'm getting the cube
 Illedan: Got a cube the last time for my stream, but I do no longer fit M&#160;:( 
 eulerscheZahl: they award tshirts for streaming?
 eulerscheZahl: and the cube still has the glitch with 2 areas merged?
 Illedan: hmm, never seen that glitch
 Illedan: They did last time
 tobk: how can I adapt the turn time in the offline OoC? I thought my laptop is new, but still turns seems to take longer than on CG
 tobk: in fact I found the 50ms and changed it to 100ms, but now I get an exception about the game as a whole taking to long...
 eulerscheZahl: reflection or modify the SDK itself
 eulerscheZahl: or reduce the number of total turns
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK was never meant for offline testing of our bots. and there are some limits which are hard to get around
 eulerscheZahl: there's also a limit for replay size in total and per turn
 eulerscheZahl: and game summary per turn
 eulerscheZahl: and what not
 tobk: right, there was a number of maximum turns, thanks for the tip
 DanTheMan832: Where do we find the OOC top player post=mortems
 AntiSquid: on the forum

 Zenoscave: With DFS would you evaluate the score after the depth is finished only or at each step?
 Nerchio: i dont know&#160;:(
 Uljahn: isn't the score discounted?
 Zenoscave: uljahn you mean decay?
 Uljahn: ye
 Zenoscave: I'll try that
 Nerchio: zenos you still working on ooc?
 Zenoscave: yup
 jacek: thats so last week
 Nerchio: cool i need a break from that haha :D
 Zenoscave: jacek I want a top bot. I think i can get close
 Nerchio: does anyone know if you can send a bomb from factory to factory without direct connection
 Nerchio: in ghost in a cell
 icecream17: How do you replace something with  "enter" wqhen find and replace?
 jacek: :o

 icecream17: oops
 AntiSquid: you mean new line?
 icecream17: yeah
 AntiSquid: no idea how to do that in the IDE
 icecream17: ugh =(
 AntiSquid: you can do it offline though if you use another program to read your bot file and edit it that way :p
 Nerchio: omg wleslavo is everywhere to hunt me
 Nerchio: even in bronze ghost in the cell&#160;:(
 Nerchio: haunt*
 AntiSquid: shouldn't talk so much about it in chat :p
 icecream17: hmm... what's the correct way to pronounce wleslavo? (my brain keeps swtiching the l and a)
 Nerchio: also i realised how good ooc contest was for my brain i mean
 Nerchio: I understood the way of the game
 AntiSquid: doubt there's a correct way for most usernames icecream17
 Nerchio: meanwhile i am kind of lost in ghost in the cell xD
 AntiSquid: ya they usually require different approach
 Nerchio: i think my simple bot that got to bronze somehow was better than what i am doing right now ;p
 MSmits: I sucked at ghost in the cell. I got to high silver and then somehow, months later, I made gold by being pushed
 Nerchio: yea its hard for me as well
 Nerchio: but i will try
 Nerchio: ooc felt like an easy game compared to this haha
 MSmits: I like the game mechanics, but I am not great at writing a bot for it. But it has been a while, maybe I;d do better now
 icecream17: AUGH! I give up on this weeks puzzle.
 Astrobytes: It's not a puzzle, it's a multi
 Nerchio: what are you playing icecream
 Astrobytes: Twixt-PP
 Astrobytes: "Puzzle of the Week"
 Nerchio: idk that one

 MSmits: darkhorse64 what is your onitama rollout count?
 test__: any idea&#160;? 
 MSmits: looks like my onitama mcts is working. 82 games in wood 2, all won, no crashes. But the eval is very bad still, so probably won't get ranked high
 Illedan: Nice, enough for wood 1?
 Astrobytes: That's the one with the masters and shrines?
 Illedan: y
 MSmits: well i didnt lose a single game, so yeah. It's doing the wood 1 submission now
 MSmits: I like it, but will have to think hard on an eval
 Astrobytes: Very bitboard-y looking
 MSmits: ye, crammed full state into a uint64_t :P
 Astrobytes: Of course :D
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: even positions too :thinking:
 MSmits: all
 Illedan: And live/dead?
 test__: can someone help with clash of code 
 test__:&#160;? 
 MSmits: full game state, everything you can think of
 Astrobytes: Maniac :D
 Illedan: -.-

 Astrobytes: looks like most of your MCTS nodes 
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: ny oware one is the same
 MSmits: except i call it board I think
 MSmits: instead of state
 Astrobytes: Y thought it looked familiar
 MSmits: they are both very narrowly fitting in 64 bit. It;s cool
 Astrobytes: I assume this not an early termination one?
 MSmits: it is for now
 MSmits: not sure what I should be doing
 Astrobytes: Oh interesting. 
 MSmits: the early termination is easiest to code so i start with it
 MSmits: no sim = les work
 Astrobytes: Ah, yes that may change
 Astrobytes: True
 test__: can you please help to understand this clash of code 
 MSmits: I may have screwed up my mcts scores. All my values are 0

 Uljahn: test__: good puzzle, just've solved it
 MSmits: it wins due to solving :P
 Astrobytes: That damn solver :D
 MSmits: when it wins that is
 test__: Uljahn any aidea
 MSmits: it's ranked about 12 in wood 1, not very good
 Astrobytes: I was gonna start Tulips and Daisies tonight but slipped a disc doing my grandads garden so can't concentrate due to painkillers
 MSmits: a disc?
 test__: Uljahn whats the solution i'm loosing my mind 
 Astrobytes: Lower back issue
 MSmits: oh, crap
 Uljahn: first number is the number of ints in input, then sum the rest and multiply by one of those ints
 Uljahn: ezpz
 Astrobytes: Yeah, pretty crap
 MSmits: this goes away with rest though?
 Astrobytes: Yeahhh, rest when really bad but have to keep moving, hence the painkillers
 MSmits: ah yeah
 Astrobytes: I'll live, had it before
 MSmits: have to be extra careful because hospitals arent much help now
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, I'm not remotely near hospitalisation :D
 Astrobytes: Just f'ing painful!
 MSmits: ahh ok, well that sucks
 Astrobytes: Anyway. Quite like the tulips and daisies multi idea, another weird TTT variant 
 Astrobytes: But makes sense.
 struct: Looks hard
 MSmits: is it TTT though? It seems a bit like STC
 MSmits: whole areas being cleared
 Astrobytes: Bit of both
 struct: Way harder than STC
 MSmits: why is it harder?
 struct: more moves
 Astrobytes: Areas are only cleared if they meet the 4+ in a row criteria
 MSmits: right
 MadKnight: hey hey struct have u found Snef&#160;?
 Astrobytes: So if you got 4 up, 4 across and 2 on diagonal you only clear the up and across
 struct: yes, but I will talk with him later
 MSmits: oh ok, so multiple 4 in a row at once, but nothing else
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: interesting
 Astrobytes: 4+
 MSmits: right
 Astrobytes: More gold for more in a row, fibonacci-based scoring
 MSmits: zombie based?
 struct: Arent adjacent cleared aswell?
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: "if the number of adjacent flowers in this direction is larger or equal to 4, all adjacent flowers in this direction are harvested."
 Astrobytes: Yes struct, I think I explained that
 Astrobytes: 4+ going right, 4+ going up, both cleared
 Astrobytes: If there are 2 in say the top right diagonal, they are not cleared, only the one that is shared with the others
 struct: ok, I understood the rules wrong
 struct: I was thinking it would also clear the neighbors
 struct: Like it clears stones on STC
 Astrobytes: only if they form a line of 4+ in each cardinal
 Astrobytes: *not cardinal, ordinal
 VincentBab: hey thank you MSmits i finally got to legend&#160;;)
 MSmits: yay! grats
 Astrobytes: gz Vincent
 darkhorse64: MSmits: don't know if it's really meaningfull. Anyway, I got 200k per 50ms
 MSmits: is that root visits&gt;
 darkhorse64: Yes
 MSmits: ah ok, i meant full rollouts
 MSmits: but yeah it is hard to compare
 MSmits: i dont have a simulation now and a really simple eval. I get somewhere between 200 and 350k root visits
 MSmits: full rollouts about 30-50k
 MSmits: trying to get transpositions working now. It times out sometimes
 darkhorse64: I do not have full rollouts and the way I expand is also peculiar. Let'say I eval 200k positions
 MSmits: ah ok, it's not that far from what I have, so thats good
 struct: MSmit Ill try send you csb code tomorrow, ill comment some stuff so its easier to understand
 MSmits: thats great struct
 MSmits: darkhorse64 I am measuring how often transpositions occur
 MSmits: they occur a lot
 MSmits: if i just record states and dont do anything else (so i dont link them) and then count how often I have a repeated state, then 40% of states during the game are repeated
 MSmits: but of course that varies
 MSmits: this is huge, by comparison: UTTT has 0,1 - 0,2%
 MSmits: so I will for sure use them. Just have to make this stop timing out&#160;:)
 DualPhoe: hello guys
 struct: hi
 darkhorse64: Interesting statistics. This validates your tiny board
 darkhorse64: The leaderboard is on fire. Just when  I wanted to get a break between two contests
 Astrobytes: still AVX-Smitsi'ing your CSB struct?
 struct: I havent started yet
 struct: I stoppped once i ifinished the sim
 Astrobytes: Oh OK
 MSmits: darkhorse64 I am not trying to draw you back into onitama, just picking your brain, dont feel pushed&#160;:)
 MSmits: you need something dramatic to beat karlis o anyway
 emigr2k1: YO HELLO HOW ARE OYU GUYS
 darkhorse64: I was 2nd this morning, now 5th
 MSmits: yes but this is random I think
 emigr2k1: why you ignore me

 cegprakash: is there a good seed to use?
 cegprakash: or can I use 42?
 cegprakash: in my srand
 cegprakash: oh no
 cegprakash: the ladder is cruel
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-ocean-of-code/cegprakash">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-ocean-of-code/cegprakash</a>
 cegprakash: in my final 40 games out off the 100 games I lost only 3 games
 cegprakash: means my bot is so strong against top guys
 AntiSquid: so did you promote&#160;??
 cegprakash: no
 cegprakash: that's why ladder cruel
 cegprakash: may be unlucky submit
 cegprakash: I am right now very scared of enemy mines and that's forcing me to use a lot of surfaces
 cegprakash: is this okay for a silver b ot?
 cegprakash: I mean to get to gold
 YannT: shouldn't need to even worry about mines in silver
 YannT: silver boss doesn't avoid them, as long as you lay and detonate mines you should promote easy
 cegprakash: no there are a lot of bunch of bots that use mines in silver
 cegprakash: without adding mines tracking it's tough to even get into top 50
 YannT: in silver?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: there are 545 bots in silver now
 cegprakash: and about 100 bots use mines
 YannT: I think I only did mine tracking/laying in gold
 YannT: but it was maybe a different beast during the contest
 cegprakash: yeah
 cegprakash: I have a solid win rate on cgstats &gt; 65%
 YannT: still I saw the silver boss, iit has no mine avoidance
 YannT: should be easy enough
 cegprakash: but my rank is not climbing
 cegprakash: should I remove my mine avoidance too? I get scared of mines and get into trouble myself
 YannT: I would say so
 YannT: focus on pathing, torpedo and laying/triggering mines
 YannT: it really should be enough
 YannT: again, the silver boss doesn't avoid them
 cegprakash: mm.. my submission is at 46%.. If I don't promote I resubmit without mine detection
 YannT: hang on I'll watch your replays
 icecream17: Wow. I got pushed from 75th and 22nd in Ooc
 icecream17: *to
 cegprakash: improved or decreased?
 cegprakash: ppl pushed you up?
 icecream17: y
 YannT: cegprakash: few pointers: you are too liberal with your torpedoes, me more sure before you fire, same with your mines, and also, you don't lay enough mines
 AntiSquid: if you have overall decent bot you should be able to promote
 cegprakash: replay link?
 cegprakash: I can explain
 YannT: I watched a few
 cegprakash: I'm very liberal with mine trigger agreed
 cegprakash: but torpedo I'm not liberal at all
 YannT: you have an iinsane miss rate with your torpedoes too
 YannT: it's actually not good
 cegprakash: oh yes
 YannT: my final bot has like a 90% requirement to consider firing
 YannT: I'll miss like once iin a blue moon
 cegprakash: I see I reduced my 75% condition to 50%
 cegprakash: I'll change it back to 75%
 cegprakash: and see what happens
 cegprakash: *70%
 YannT: my condition was "you hit every ennemy position except one"
 YannT: for mine &amp; torpedo
 cegprakash: that's too greedy :O 
 cegprakash: jealous
 Qi-cosmic: hi guys
 YannT: less torpedo and less silence = more charges for mining
 YannT: = easy gold&#160;:)
 YannT: you don't gain anything by missing a torpedoo, in fact you lose stealth and charges
 YannT: it's actually reallly bad
 cegprakash: agreed
 YannT: same for missing triggers btw, but in gold that shouldn't be a factor
 YannT: I went from silver to legend with a 100% torpedo requirement actually
 cegprakash: :O
 cegprakash: this means ur tracking so so perfect
 YannT: I only relaxed it in legend because ennemy bots maximize properly their stealth and value having an outlyer position
 cegprakash: I have loopholes in my tracking
 YannT: ah, you could consider both blast zones though
 cegprakash: also when me and opponent uses torpedo in same turn, it's difficult for me to track enemy life because he sometimes self damages
 YannT: just remove positions that aren't in either instead of none?
 blasterpoard: having tracking without bugs is strictly required in OoC
 YannT: I made an executive decision to ignore self damage actually
 YannT: it's an approximation, but was never really a problem
 cegprakash: if opponent does a self damage that can screw ur prediction bad
 cegprakash: and cost a game
 YannT: oh yeah
 YannT: happens once in every 1000 game
 cegprakash: but it seems to be worth it? :O oh
 YannT: typically bots will only self damage for finisher moves
 YannT: that's been my experience anyway
 YannT: it is actually bad for a bot to fire a self damage torpedo, because of retaliation the next turn
 YannT: so they don't do it
 YannT: torpedo is a tradeoff between giving away your position and doing damage... self damage make that tradeoff bad in nearly every situation
 Nerchio: if you do a damage map you can avoid most problems with damage calculation
 cegprakash: yeah damage map would be my next addition if this can't promote me
 YannT: I made an actual decision to assume that bots don't self damage
 cegprakash: I resubmitted  assuming bots never self damage
 cegprakash: lets see
 YannT: allows me to exclude more positions and is true 99.9% of the time
 YannT: in 0.01% of the time, that's a guaranteed loss, but it doesn't matter&#160;:)
 wlesavo: i liked pbs approach with double tracker
 YannT: oh yeah!
 YannT: wish I thought of that actually
 YannT: so many assumptions I didn't wanna make because too risky&#160;:(
 wlesavo: yeah
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454091187">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454091187</a> the problem with this strat YannT
 YannT: no self damage is the only one I actually allowed
 cegprakash: I lose to someone who only uses silence
 YannT: you detonate mines too liberally I told you
 YannT: just mine the fuck out of everything
 YannT: chain silence doesn't work
 YannT: they will be detected
 blasterpoard: if your tracking was good, you'd find him
 YannT: and you'll have mines everywhere
 cegprakash: alright I go harsh with my mines lets see what happens
 cegprakash: like I used to place mines anywhere.. but now I only place it where I suspect enemy can be
 YannT: that's bad, you use mines to claim territory
 YannT: either he goes on them and gets exploded, or he doesn't and he'll lose by surface
 cegprakash: capture territory?
 YannT: watch some legend replays&#160;;)
 cegprakash: my bot is suffering after removing self damage
 cegprakash: may be many silver bots still do self damage?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454093175">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454093175</a> like the boss at turn 203
 cegprakash: because of that I get into 0 enemy possibilities
 cegprakash: and lose the game from there
 cegprakash: 0 enemy positions*
 cegprakash: I have a code to reset the enemy map when possibilities to 1 for work around.. may be I can add that
 cegprakash: I have it commented
 MadKnight: hey cegprakash

 AntiSquid: stop posting clash of code link in chat or i start banning
 dbdr: hey Quidome!
 dbdr: looks like you are progressing&#160;:)
 CoderHarshu: Hello
 Illedan: Hi
 WINWINWIN: Hey coderHarshu
 mark7: Hi
 Quidome: No progression at all dbdr, only a resubmit from the old version after a broken one&#160;:(
 dbdr: oh OK
 Adnmaster: im trying horse racing duals it passes all of them except one and i tested it myself there is nothing wrong can someone pls help
 CoderHarshu:  New in competitive programming! any suggestions for beginners&#160;?  
 Adnmaster: you can try python
 Adnmaster: and look up hackerrank in google
 CoderHarshu: i have done Python basics
 Adnmaster: oh
 Adnmaster: they ask hard quest,ons in code of clash
 CoderHarshu: and solving problems at Hackerearth and Hackerrank
 Adnmaster: you can try code royale, if thats too hard, you can try code golf
 CoderHarshu: i am able to solve the problem but the i take too much time!
 Adnmaster: then you have to go into a lot of clash of cde battles until you get faster
 WINWINWIN: CoderHarshu, I`m a beginner too, found it best to start with bot programming CSB
 CoderHarshu: Whats that&#160;?  WINWINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: Bot programming: coders strike back
 WINWINWIN: and its just 3 WIN s :D
 CoderHarshu: ok bro
 MSmits: better yet, type win + tab
 MSmits: this is a functionality to calculate the optimal number of wins
 CoderHarshu: thats awsome thanks buddy MSmits
 MSmits: you're welcome :P
 WINWINWIN: :D Msmits
 CoderHarshu: WINWINWIN
 CoderHarshu: :grinning:
 dbdr: wow, submits seem slow right now
 mark7: Of which contest? is there a contest going on?
 AntiSquid: no
 dbdr: in multis
 AntiSquid: what multi are you playing now dbdr?
 dbdr: Tulips
 eulerscheZahl: some of us aren't competing for prizes it seems
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i still try to win that $0 :P
 darkhorse64: nor for xp
 AntiSquid: if you win it, how do you verify if they gave you the money euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i'll ask about payment process in the forum
 MSmits: this means re curse cant compete you know, Canada has an overly strict gambling law.. cash prizes are a big no no
 MSmits: unless they cleared it with the government
 dbdr: as if it was luck...
 MSmits: darkhorse64 look at my last cg bench. Onitama is crazy rps
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d42b3f7f-247e-4161-a5ba-b50178abbd91">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d42b3f7f-247e-4161-a5ba-b50178abbd91</a>
 MSmits: poor tric trac if i submit this :P
 Salted: MSmits, that's not at all true. I've won competitions here in Canada that pay cash prices. 
 dbdr: opponent selection is random?
 MSmits: yeah government sanctioned afaik, i was told this
 eulerscheZahl: impressive winrate
 dbdr: not the same number of matches...
 MSmits: yeah it's random
 Salted: I live in Canada and can tell you it's not true
 MSmits: ok
 LoGos: MSmits did you have any problems with CGBenchmark recently?
 MSmits: no, but i would like to know how to force equal match count in cg bench
 MSmits: do you know how dbdr?
 dbdr: yes, edit the source&#160;;)
 MSmits: hah nvm, i am not compiling anything java
 dbdr: or wrirte a similar tool yourself, it's not very hard
 MSmits: not for you&#160;:)
 dbdr: write it in python
 MSmits: I'm not that good at that sort of thing
 dbdr: look at eulerscheZahl's script for logging in and playing a match
 MSmits: But i can if I need to i suppose
 dbdr: that's about 10 lines of python
 Salted: The best part about contests in Canada is you pay no taxes on any winnings. The prize provider must pay the taxes and you get the full amount.
 MSmits: yeah euler showed me before
 dbdr: the rest is pretty simple logic
 MSmits: thats nice Salted
 eulerscheZahl: python :rocket:
 dbdr: go through the opponents, add up the results
 MSmits: I just wrote a minesweeper bot in python as par t of an assignment
 eulerscheZahl: what's the winrate?
 eulerscheZahl: as sometimes you can't be sure
 MSmits: 80%, the first moves aren't guaranteed
 MSmits: so you might click on a bomb
 MSmits: first move
 eulerscheZahl: even end moves sometimes
 MSmits: yes, sometimes
 MSmits: but very rarely in this case
 dbdr: you can get 100% winrate at minesweeper
 MSmits: the assignment asked us to also take into account subsets
 Salted: MSmits, the first move should always be save in minesweeper. It only computes the board after the first move. 
 MSmits: i know Salted
 Salted: safe*
 dbdr: just make your bot read the memory of the referee to know where the bombs are
 MSmits: but this is a ghetto minesweeper
 MSmits: not full implementation like the microsoft version
 MSmits: I only wrote the bot, not the game
 eulerscheZahl: we need a minesweeper on CG
 eulerscheZahl: and spam submit till you pass
 MSmits: would be fun
 MSmits: is there a puzzle?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: minesweeper puzzle?
 MSmits: ah cool
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/minesweeper">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/minesweeper</a>
 darkhorse64: MSmits:   this version is not yet submitted&#160;? I have made some tiny improvements, mostly reliability. It shows a bit in the leaderboard. trictrac is now my preferred victim
 eulerscheZahl: but not an interactive one
 ZarthaxX: test your python code now smito lol
 MSmits: have to convert a lot of it
 MSmits: not feeling the urge atm, but its cool
 LoGos: how do tools like CGBench work? Do they launch codingame in headless mode and play in ide?
 WINWINWIN: Do you top coders ever use python?
 MSmits: LoGos yeah
 darkhorse64: Always C++, except for golf
 MSmits: WINWINWIN also yeah, not me, but some
 eulerscheZahl: just sending the requests
 MSmits: sometimes fast coding is more important than fast code
 MSmits: then python is great
 eulerscheZahl: bit REST API for the CG website, makes it easy to script
 eulerscheZahl: big*
 Salted: I always wonder how much of a code library the top people draw from. They always code in the same thing for every competition. 
 LoGos: MSmits thanks. CGB is not working for me so it seems like I need to write similar script.
 MSmits: well you can't use separate files, so you copy paste a lot of old code
 MSmits: but it depends on the game. If it is a fairly simple game you can just copy paste a minimax or mcts and adjust it
 MSmits: LoGos which version?
 MSmits: also, i had some weird errors with cg bench too
 MSmits: if you for example, work in VS and just try to use the C++ file from there and load it in CG bench it may bug out because of the encoding
 MSmits: I have to make a new c++ text file, copy the whole bot into it, then run cg bench
 LoGos: MSits the latest one. I'm getting NullPointerException just after retrieving cookies and sesion info. It happens both on Linux and Windows. I also created brand new account to test but the same thing happens
 MSmits: very likely your file is just set up wrong
 MSmits: your json
 MSmits: careful sharing this btw
 MSmits: because of accoutn info. Let me share mine
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c1f1870-d848-4f1f-bad4-a3cdd29451f3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0c1f1870-d848-4f1f-bad4-a3cdd29451f3</a>
 dbdr: NullPointerException should not happen regardless of your config
 dbdr: report a bug&#160;:)
 MSmits: might be older version of cg bench&#160;?
 dbdr: nice password MSmits&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes, just enter, no characters
 MSmits: noone will guess this
 LoGos: thanks MSmits! dbdr ok, will do if it realy is a bug
 dbdr: NPE is a bug, no question
 RoboStac: msmits - you can have the same matches against each opponent by having one opponent and multiple code sections (they can all be the same file). It does give you separate reports per opponent / play all against opponent 1 before moving on though
 MSmits: ahh thanks RoboStac
 dbdr: 306 results found for «Score - Computing» in CSB
 dbdr: I guess that's a promotion wave
 dbdr: yeah, almost all are rank 27K and 28K
 dbdr: oh, 356 now, growing&#160;:(
 LoGos: MSmits its working now :grinning:Thanks! Looks like the yaml file is the problem. dbdr I'll send report

 RoboStac: why are you trying to read a file (and from a windows file path)?
 FlashLoremIpsumFromHell_6454: hello
 MSmits: I also know jslo is upstairs
 MSmits: wife quarantined you huh
 RoboStac: also when using java you have to call your class Solution
 eulerscheZahl: RIP CSB, classic :D
 dbdr: RIP CG for 2 hours

 IAmNoob: Hate this
 IAmNoob: i was making a problem
 IAmNoob: and site stopped
 IAmNoob: all gone
 jslo: i don't like writing the code online lol
 jslo: that's why i write the solutions local
 IAmNoob: I was designing a problem
 IAmNoob: Making tests and so on
 IAmNoob: no solving

 jslo: it's not giving me correct distances
 jslo: it's easy
 jslo: i must've done something dumb
 jslo: i'll transfer it over to the server when i'm done
 jslo: that's why i'm using a file
 AntiSquid: get some avatars guys, you look like a bunch of new accounts that just came in to spam emotes, was about to ban a few&#160;:/
 jslo: don't ban me
 AntiSquid: i won't
 jslo: :open_mouth:
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 jslo: :sob:
 wlesavo: AntiSquid oh, i was worried it is just me
 eulerscheZahl: but don't ban JBM :scream:
 AntiSquid: get avatars to avoid the confusion is all i am saying
 AntiSquid: JBM easier to avoid banning higher level
 eulerscheZahl: so you check the user level before ban?
 JBM: what did I do *this* time?
 eulerscheZahl: not set an avatar
 JBM: that's not illegal
 AntiSquid: yes, doubt anyone makes new account copies 5 million puzzles and then spams chat, i check both
 jslo: i got one

 MadKnight: NotSoMuchOfAnAdminSquid
 IAmNoob: and i havent seen problems
 jslo: cool
 jslo: it's a super easy program
 jslo: not sure why i'm getting the issue

 dbdr: jacek, working on your uTTT?
 jacek: just trying lucky resubmit
 jacek: but i had some weird timeouts a while ago
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: oh nice, tomatoes has a rust bot at #28
 dbdr: feels strange to see 6 rust bots in legend, and none is mine
 wlesavo: i gave an honest try to get uttt legend in python 
 dbdr: that's a challenge!
 dbdr: there  is one
 struct: how far did you get?
 struct: one with 0.03 score :p
 wlesavo: maybe ill come back to it, i had 0 depth eval on ~280 gold, but failed to improve it, other algos i tried got screwed on performance
 MSmits: you kinda need mcts or similar
 dbdr: the python bot in legend prints as a command "GOAL LEVEL 30"
 wlesavo: i know i need that, but couldn't make it work on reasonably ok depth
 struct: You can try c++&#160;:)
 struct: or rust
 MSmits: I dont think python can make legend
 MSmits: whats in there has not been promoted in python i am guessing
 dbdr: well, someone did
 MSmits: cant you change language?
 dbdr: or they changed language afterwards?
 struct: How do you know db?
 struct: They can change yeah
 struct: There is also D on legend
 struct: also broken bot
 wlesavo: lol
 dbdr: they certainly didn't get to legend by printing "GOAL LEVEL 30" :D
 MSmits: marchete has the most impressive language with an inferior performance language
 AntiSquid: pro D players
 MSmits: impressive rank that is
 MSmits: not easy to get that high in C#
 AntiSquid: spanish?
 MSmits: haha
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: Dutch is harder I think
 MSmits: dbdr pretty nice too in java
 dbdr: with minimax
 MSmits: though you should translate it to rust 
 wlesavo: i dunno, my 0 depth eval version did quite well for like 5ms time spent, that gave me hope
 dbdr: do we know what Marchete uses?
 MSmits: prolly mcts
 AntiSquid: hungarian is probably the hardest in europe, along with finnish 
 dbdr: I should yes. you're not afraid?&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: to learn the language? kinda
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: not sure dbdr, i dont know how good you are at these things, you dont try very often
 dbdr: facing your fears is a often a good idea AntiSquid&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: then i will learn the chinese alphabet
 dbdr: I tried pretty hard at uTTT, I was even first at one point, even with Java, which obvously does not help
 dbdr: but rust will be better for sure, and I learnt a lot since too
 MSmits: I am really really interested in your eval though
 MSmits: I am thinking of trying an early playout termination version for uttt
 MSmits: just out of interest
 MSmits: because it works so well in other games
 ELPADRE: guys thor exercise is giving me a headache
 MSmits: then you're holding the hammer wrong
 MSmits: you'll get lots of accidents that way
 wlesavo: dbdr how long ago that was?
 dbdr: I love this about CG
 ELPADRE: can't get the angles&#160;?
 AntiSquid: finally above rank 500 in UTG, damn hate this game ... and my bugged bot
 dbdr: wlesavo I wrote my uTTT bot in Java 2 years ago wlesavo
 ELPADRE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cd5e89c5-b094-443d-9604-a233bcfb097e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cd5e89c5-b094-443d-9604-a233bcfb097e</a>
 MSmits: ELPADRE you have to track positions yourself
 MSmits: you know how you moved
 AntiSquid: why do yo uneed ankles in thor puzzle?
 AntiSquid: angles *
 MSmits: you only get initial position
 MSmits: then you need to update it yourself
 wlesavo: dbdr and how long ago you started learning rust?
 coednoob: i'm trying to code a neural network algorithm for flappy bird because i'm bored :laughing:
 dbdr: (I had to resubmit it 6 month ago to fix a timeout issue after a CG update, but no change otherwise)
 MSmits: coednoob use NEAT framework
 dbdr: 1.3 years&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: codenoob do one for oware abapa
 eulerscheZahl: russian AI cup, wasn't it?
 dbdr: in January, for RAIC last year
 eulerscheZahl: codeball
 dbdr: xactly
 dbdr: was one month, and I cared less about it than a CG one, so a good occasion to try something new
 jrke: hey anyone of you know how to code in kali linux
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxFDaIOHsE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMxFDaIOHsE</a> coednoob
 dbdr: I don't regret it&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: "wlesavo I wrote my uTTT bot in Java 2 years ago wlesavo" you wrote wlesavo twice (sorry for nitpicking)
 eulerscheZahl: jrke not a question of the operating system.what language do you want to use?
 wlesavo: AntiSquid you wrote wlesavo 3 times
 eulerscheZahl: install a compiler/interpreter for it and start coding
 eulerscheZahl: maybe an IDE too
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: lol wlesavo :D
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo
 AntiSquid: lol wlesavo
 wlesavo: lol
 wlesavo: (for symmetry)
 coednoob: omg i clicked on the link and it was so loud! didn't know my anime music was up so high :laughing:
 AntiSquid: your natural pattern matching is quite good 
 dbdr: true, lol is a palindrome wlesavo&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: coednoob beware the anime haters in this chat, but don't worry too much we need more good people like you
 jacek: huh
 coednoob: if there are any anime haters i will use my death note and vanquish them.
 MSmits: weebs
 coednoob: what
 MSmits: i dunno, its a new word i learned
 AntiSquid: it's mainly MSmits and AutomatonNN that hate anime
 coednoob: oh i thought you called my name.
 AutomatonNN:  { ,JulL anyone else has a problem with the list of "the last test" then when you get confused you w
 MSmits: no no, AntiSquid keeps sharing anime stuff and then I call him a weeb. It's a thing
 AntiSquid: but weeb stands for wannabe ...
 MSmits: really?
 MSmits: it's not anime related?
 coednoob: no it stands for weaboo
 MSmits: o
 AntiSquid: i don't want to be jap lol
 AntiSquid: and i am not obsessed with their culture
 MSmits: except marrying anime dolls
 coednoob: .
 AntiSquid: in fact i don't even want to live there as a regular citizen
 coednoob: why dolls.
 MSmits: they do that
 coednoob: why not body pillows.
 MSmits: hmm not sure
 MSmits: ask AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: maybe if i was rich, but even then there are better places
 MSmits: Sweden?
 AntiSquid: MSmits <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/weeb/">https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/weeb/</a>
 MSmits: ahh ok
 AntiSquid: i am not even an otaku
 MSmits: I will call you Sweeb then
 MSmits: you wish you were Swedish
 coednoob: wait.
 coednoob: squid
 coednoob: you remind me of squidward,which i remembered something really weird about spongebob.
 coednoob: wanna hear it :grinning:
 AntiSquid: i don't watch spongebob
 MSmits: coednoob no spoilers
 MSmits: AntiSquid hasn't watched it yet
 coednoob: its not spoilers
 coednoob: the main characters in spongebob represent the seven deadly sins.
 coednoob: and in the qanime
 coednoob: dammit.

 coednoob: imma change my background real quick
 MSmits: spongebob is in the bible?
 coednoob: no let me explain
 AntiSquid: spongebob memes are everywhere and they reference everything
 AntiSquid: what's the appeal&#160;?
 MSmits: if you learn spongebob, you learn everything
 coednoob: the seven deadly sins are sloth,envy,lust,greed,gluttony,wrath,and pride
 coednoob: patrick is sloth
 coednoob: plankton is envy
 eulerscheZahl: crabs = greed
 AntiSquid: i don't know the characters&#160;:/
 coednoob: spongebob is lust
 AntiSquid: i just know the sponge 
 coednoob: mr.crabs is greed
 MSmits: coednoob, I am pretty sure you can apply similar logic to the smurfs. Maybe you can do a smurf version for AntiSquid
 coednoob: um.
 coednoob: i can do anime version.
 MSmits: smurfs is animated
 MSmits: good enough
 coednoob: dont you.
 coednoob: ever.
 coednoob: say.
 coednoob: that.
 struct: What should I change on UI 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/MW2Dqz1.png">https://i.imgur.com/MW2Dqz1.png</a>
 AntiSquid: tell MSmits to change avatar @coednoob <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8d/b2/56/8db2562e1f70531eb33eae21f217504e.png">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8d/b2/56/8db2562e1f70531eb33eae21f217504e.png</a>
 coednoob: ok
 coednoob: change it to this
 coednoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/945400.jpg">https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/945400.jpg</a>
 AntiSquid: why not just one character?
 coednoob: why one when you can have all.
 coednoob: i have the power of UA
 coednoob: with this picture.
 AntiSquid: hey the next contest which starts on the 7th of May is probably sponsored by bandai namco
 MSmits: why?
 coednoob: who just straight up forgot to sleep last night.
 MSmits: i mean how do you know
 coednoob: if yes raise your hand
 AntiSquid: guessing
 MSmits: mmh
 coednoob: :raising_hand:
 MSmits: maybe sponsed by the bill &amp; melinda gates foundation to stop corona spread
 struct: well they own the rights to pacman
 struct: ITs anniversary 
 MSmits: I didn't sleep much last night, wanted to find a bug in my minesweeper
 coednoob: and funeral is a life graduation. 
 AntiSquid: they have a promo, pacman 2 championship edition is free to download on steam
 AntiSquid: they have a contest running around the same time (well before cg contest starts)
 MSmits: hmm
 coednoob: you holding you breath is just a life timer.when you breath it resets.
 coednoob: and also.
 MSmits: not jumping off a bridge is a life timer also, every time you decide not to, it resets
 coednoob: air could have the life immunity but we grow immune to that as we get older.and them get fully immune and die,
 eulerscheZahl: you submitted onitama at 4am MSmits. your sleep cycle is so completely broken :D
 MSmits: heh, well my wife is sick (not corona) so that got me a bit more irregular. But I am always irregular when I am not teaching
 MSmits: it's 2 week may vacation
 coednoob: damn.
 eulerscheZahl: will schools open again after that?
 coednoob: no
 coednoob: next year.
 MSmits: well they will open the way they were before, teaching by google meet
 eulerscheZahl: was for MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: i see
 coednoob: my school is dumb.
 MSmits: but the exam candidates get to do some final tests (not the actual national exam). To get a fair chance at getting their diploma
 eulerscheZahl: here in germany school slowly starts again
 coednoob: they gave a code genius an online assignment.
 MSmits: yea they do here also, but just primary schools
 AntiSquid: i don't follow the news but i hear there are less covid patients
 coednoob: no
 AntiSquid: yes
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's different in each country
 MSmits: in some places they are smart and in other places they are stupid. But regardless of brains, it may go away with better weather and come back again later
 AntiSquid: a second wave would be annoying though
 MSmits: or a third
 AntiSquid: or a 3rd / 4th / whatever
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it will happen according to most scientists
 coednoob: 3,090,844 total
 coednoob: a second wave.
 MSmits: and it will be better and worse. better because some will have immunity, worse because it will come together with the flu
 eulerscheZahl: we are 0.5% done already
 AntiSquid: until we are all immune like bats?
 coednoob: its not bats
 TheNoLifeKing: y'all, is codingame failing? i can't play the test cases
 coednoob: its from a research facility is Wuhan.
 MSmits: conspiracy theory... not factual
 AntiSquid: ya probably
 coednoob: they conduct experiments with viruses like that 
 AnielloBaldi: Hi there
 AntiSquid: nothing to do with conspiracies lol
 coednoob: a bat could have easily flew in and out.
 MSmits: viruses came out of those wildlife markets before. It's well documented
 coednoob: spread it to its family
 AntiSquid: someone spilled a bucket, floor got wet, that's not a conspiracy
 coednoob: one bat gets eaten by a snake.
 coednoob: chinese people eat snakes.
 coednoob: thats how it started.
 coednoob: thats what i think at least.
 MSmits: the world doesn't work that way. You can't just pick an explanation on the basis of it sounding good.
 dbdr: you can. it just does not make it true&#160;;)
 MSmits: if you're going against the general consensus explanation, you better have some data to prove it
 MSmits: right dbdr
 AntiSquid: yes must synchronize with the crowd and homogenize thoughts
 MSmits: no need, you can do your own research
 eulerscheZahl: i heard you can get quite far without using actual data
 MSmits: but if you dont, you need to trust scientists
 eulerscheZahl: even become president
 coednoob: MoNkEy SoCkS
 coednoob: i mean banana,my autocorrect is weird.
 AntiSquid: ok then UK should aim for herd immunity
 coednoob: there is a person who could possibly contain immunity from viruses and age.
 coednoob: a scientist injected himself with 3.5 million year old bacteria,which usually bacteria would easily die out,but this one was immune,so it would be impossible for them to get it.
 MSmits: if vaccines and medicines dont exist, then herd immunity is all you have. Which includes of course protecting the weak and only letting the people who can handle it get sich
 MSmits: sick that is... also do this slowly over time because of hospital capacity
 MSmits: also known as social distancing...which is what most countries have been doing
 AntiSquid: ah you don't know the background story 
 coednoob: wanna see something cool.
 AntiSquid: it was more about "lockdown bad, it prevents herd immunity" basically
 MSmits: the background is probably Boris Johnson saying and doing stupid sht?
 AntiSquid: it was a scientist MSmits
 MSmits: ahh ok
 coednoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/342f1865-fb4d-4bbc-88e0-c9e6bea70b5a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/342f1865-fb4d-4bbc-88e0-c9e6bea70b5a</a>
 MSmits: methinks he left one variable out of the equation with his statements
 MSmits: also don't trust any one scientist. Trust scientific consensus.It's not perfect but better than trusting a random scientist and way better than trusting any old conspiracy
 coednoob: thats only a fragment of it
 AntiSquid: there's a new model of how the moon is formed, before it's discovery you must believe the one model to be true, the next day you must align your belief
 AntiSquid: was formed *
 coednoob: wait what.
 coednoob: what did i miss...
 AntiSquid: draw your own conclusions
 MSmits: AntiSquid for this we only have computer models. There are several ways  it could have happened and all we can say is that some ways are more likely than others. There is very little actual evidence
 MSmits: this is because the earth was mostly molten when it happened
 AntiSquid: ya but that one computer model was most accurate when it was discovered
 MSmits: Not all science is the same, there are things we are sure of and things that are just likely and consistent with what we know
 dbdr: never sure 100%
 coednoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.35262911.5798/flat,750x1000,075,f.u3.jpg">https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.35262911.5798/flat,750x1000,075,f.u3.jpg</a>
 MSmits: well sure as in we did the same experiment a million times with the same result each time
 dbdr: could be luck&#160;;)
 MSmits: but 100% is a weird thing
 MSmits: sure
 coednoob: ok lets drop the scientific stuff i havent slept in 5 days and i am losing brain cells.
 MSmits: let's say we are sure within floating point accuracy limits
 dbdr: could be the laws of physics change very very slowly and we haven't been around long enough to notice it
 AntiSquid: if you do the same thing multiple times and expect different results, then what does that say?
 coednoob: did you see the link i put
 MSmits: then we can still be sure about what the physics is like now
 MSmits: also that is a possibility some people put into their models&#160;:)
 dbdr: yes. within boundaries. like newtonian physics was pretty sure
 AntiSquid: ok nvm, derailing, point was draw your own conclusions ... don't have to choose between herd mentality and random fantasies
 MSmits: within the realm of experimentation newtonian physics was very accurate
 MSmits: and still is i guess
 dbdr: exactly
 MSmits: you always need to be careful about your claims in science
 MSmits: AntiSquid I think everyone agrees with your point :P
 coednoob: ok no more science.
 MSmits: except coednoob
 AntiSquid: mesentery has a consciousness of its own -
 MSmits: whats that
 dbdr: yes, that's actually a problem in public debate. a scientist will be very careful what they say. an anti-science will just say whatever sounds good to them
 dbdr: it gives them an advantage
 MSmits: yup
 coednoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thechive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2687124-7.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=info&amp;w=600">https://thechive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2687124-7.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=info&amp;w=600</a>
 coednoob: look at that.
 dbdr: especially in a short time span
 coednoob: what.
 coednoob: you talking short spans.
 coednoob: nothing is shorter than my attention span ..
 dbdr: why do you press play if it's on repeat?
 coednoob: what.
 AntiSquid: restart the song 10 seconds in&#160;?
 coednoob: what.
 coednoob: naruto is gay.
 coednoob: why does nobody have anything to say about that..
 coednoob: do you agree?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: kick the noob
 Automaton2000: and there is no real reason
 dbdr: bc nobody cares
 coednoob: what
 coednoob: im talking facts.naruto kissed sasuke.
 MSmits: careful, AntiSquid is a mod
 ZarthaxX: MSmits surprised you gave talk to him from the start
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 MSmits: yeah, i am tired
 MSmits: I respond more to trolls when I am tired
 ZarthaxX: he already showed as one
 ZarthaxX: ah i see
 ZarthaxX: recreate your brain&#160;;)
 coednoob: who
 coednoob: what.
 MSmits: I'll go to bed early
 dbdr: follow the toad
 MSmits: good idea
 coednoob: what toad.
 AntiSquid: coednoob you're spamming a lot the what, i get it you are excited and you like the chat, but please be considerate of others
 coednoob: ok
 Uljahn: also raise up your level, do more puzzles, because lvl3 is for trolls
 coednoob: well im too busy watching anime.
 coednoob: ok fine ill do more puzzles
 jacek: or invite toads to clash
 coednoob: ok please explain what or who toad is im super confused
 AntiSquid: he is trying to teach you how to troll on codingame in a more obscure way
 coednoob: why would i waste time trolling,the only reason im here is because i want to talk to people.
 coednoob: and i dont feel like sticking 500 toothpicks into a Styrofoam cup. 
 coednoob: ok imma go.bye
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: troll's just want love
 YannT: deploy patented teacher's authoritah
 YannT: (shit last message was more than half an hour ago :o )
 aCat: you, you have reflexes ;p
 aCat: chat is surprisingly quiet
 YannT: not that surprising, there's no contest going on :p
 aCat: bleh, yesterday was lots of weird talks

 aCat: damn, I'm not up to date
 AntiSquid: what do you want to change it to and what's wrong with the current UI&#160;?
 struct: I dont think its appealing at all
 AntiSquid: it's not :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Well change it to something appealing
 struct: The ui is different from their board, because I think its very hard to understand it

 Astrobytes: URL of the year
 Astrobytes: I like the original board struct, but I'm weird
 struct: I like it too,.but might be a bit harder to understand
 c0cainee: :tangerine:
 BloodyTurtles: when did they change the ide to monaco?
 Astrobytes: Monday
 stacked: i prefer text editor better
 Astrobytes: I sometimes use the CG IDE for puzzles or small edits, otherwise I use VS. The change to monaco is very welcome regardless.
 JBM: all i noticed is that now i sometimes have to press enter twice instead of once to go to the next line
 JBM: because braindead autocomplete
 JBM: i hate it already
 Astrobytes: I don't care for the autocomplete but I like the highlighting and zoom
 Astrobytes: And the minimap
 angelcabrera: hmm
 BloodyTurtles: same
 BloodyTurtles: the autocomplete is a bit broken
 BloodyTurtles: it never suggest anything when I need it
 Astrobytes: Can't have it all right?&#160;:)
 struct: depends on language too
 struct: on some it does a decent job
 BloodyTurtles: shouldn't it work out of the box?
 Astrobytes: The C++ is... the python isn't awful, but not great
 BloodyTurtles: for me, c++ is totally useless now
 BloodyTurtles: it loads for a few seconds
 BloodyTurtles: and by then, i already typed it out
 BloodyTurtles: and it suggests all these weird internal stuff
 Astrobytes: I usually know what I'm gonna write anyway if it's a quick edit, otherwise I'm using VS :shrug:
 BloodyTurtles: is a weighted mcts a thing?
 BloodyTurtles: like returning a number from a whoWin method
 Astrobytes: The value returned from your playout weights the nodes?
 Astrobytes: It's kind of the point of it
 BloodyTurtles: the value used to back propagate
 Astrobytes: Yes you backpropagate the result
 BloodyTurtles: thanks
 c0cainee: To those who share their code when the game ends, thank you. :heart:
 animeWeeb: is anybody here still?
 KiwiTae: nop
 KiwiTae: BloodyTurtles use VisualAssist that plugin is a bomb on VS

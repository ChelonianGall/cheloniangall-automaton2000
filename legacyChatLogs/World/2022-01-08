 MSmits: these booster side-effects are no joke
 MSmits: felt like :poop: the last time on my 2nd dose (for 24 hrs) but this time it is worse
 MSmits: I hope it works fast enough. I have to teach on monday. a building with 1200 students and omicron. Not a good combination
 therealbeef: don't think it works that fast...&#160;;-)
 MSmits: well it has done *something* or I wouldnt feel this crappy
 MSmits: our health department says it takes 7 days
 MSmits: but i think it could maybe be shorter and the 7 is on the safe side
 MSmits: I think it's shitty that they have a full lockdown, all except schools are closed, yet they don't boost the teachers first.
 MSmits: boost the people who have the most chance of getting infected
 therealbeef: it's tricky, boostering based on risk of dying might prevent more deaths
 therealbeef: if only netherlands wasn't so slow with boostering...
 MSmits: yeah the slowness is the main problem, but they could have done 60+ first, then all teachers.
 MSmits: instead it is fully by ag
 MSmits: age
 MSmits: health care professionals do get precedence. I would say in this case, teachers should be offered the same consideration.
 struct: still 2 days to recover MSmits
 struct: you will be fine
 struct: trust me, I'm a doctor
 Mortis_666: :O
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: maybe the sixth booster will be better
 MSmits: struct the recovery is not the problem. I know i'll be ok, I'm just worried the booster wont work in time
 struct: ah
 MSmits: i got it yesterday at 1 pm
 therealbeef: maybe the booster won't work anyway&#160;;-)
 MSmits: they have done some research to show both natural immunity and vaccine immunity work against omicron. Just doesn't prevent infection. Only symptoms
 MSmits: do you get less sick
 MSmits: so 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: The best bet is to get a daily shot
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Until the twice daily pill comes out
 MSmits: this might be the last covid variant we have to worry about. Mostly because of the rate of infection. After that most people will be protected. But who knows
 jacek: ez, just take vitamin D, Mg and NAC regularly
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: just turn off your tv and think about something else
 MSmits: i don't watch tv
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: whatever is making you obsess about this, turn it off
 MSmits: it's not obsession really, why would you call it that? 
 struct: i dont feel like he is obsessed
 struct: he is just worried about monday
 struct: which seems normal to me
 MSmits: I know i'll probably be fine if i get infected, I just dont like to get diseases of any kind
 MSmits: not if i dont need to
 jacek: hes more obsessed with metamcts and endgames
 MSmits: it's insane how fast omicron spreads. I think infections tripled in a few days
 MSmits: correct jacek&#160;:)
 struct: they are predicting 1% of population per day soon
 jacek: omicron propagates like mcts
 struct: here in portugal
 MSmits: yeah it's like that in most countries now struct
 MSmits: omicron has less chance of hospitalization, but because of the extreme rate of infection you could still get health care overrun
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: :rolling eyes:
 MSmits: simple facts Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it is a sore throat and runny nose
 fsy: China looks safe now
 MSmits: for most people yes, but the problem is that hospitals can only take an extremely tiny portion of the population
 MSmits: so even if only 0,01% has to be hospitalized, it could be too much
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: like every winter
 MSmits: depends on your country, in my country hospitals dont get overrun in the winter
 MSmits: pre-covid that is
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: okay, well best of luck.  let's hope the media gives us something new to worry about soon
 MSmits: who care about media. that is the problem. You have to listen to science, not media
 fsy: My hospital is very deserted
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: pfizer is not science
 MSmits: If you say so
 struct: facebook is science
 MSmits: facebook sure does science, but not the useful kind 
 struct: :D
 MSmits: how can we most easily make money and ruin society?
 fsy: what country are you in
 MSmits: it says on my profile
 struct: fsy you can over the profile pic
 MSmits: btw, a family member of mine, younger than i am, is still reovering from  covid after 2 months. It happens. Granted, this was Delta, but still. People who think they know it all, should be careful about their assumptions
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: it is just sad to see intelligent people falling for this
 MSmits: falling for what?
 MSmits: so my family member is lying to me?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: worry about covid for 3 years?
 struct: falling for your bait?
 MSmits: heh right struct
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: something you would never notice if you turned off the news
 MSmits: until you or people in your family got an unlucky case of covid
 MSmits: just because it doesnt happen to you, doesnt mean it doesnt happen
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: what if I said it was very similar to flu?  how much conditioning do you have to strongly respond to that?
 MSmits: your opinion on the comparison with flu doesn't matter. I trust scientists over some random stranger on the internet
 MSmits: and they have the data to show it has been much much worse than the flu
 MSmits: the flu is actually not a very nice disease either. Most people that claim they have the flu actually just caught a cold
 MSmits: flu is severely underestimated
 ninjadip: people i know are dying of covid, while people do die of the flu, i've never met one or heard of someone that knew someone
 MSmits: I've gotten a very bad flu once or twice in my life, something i would prefer to avoid
 MSmits: covid is like 10x more infectious though, so even if it was as bad as the flu and no more, it would be very bad. but it's not, delta is much worse than the flu. Omicron might be similar actually
 MSmits: it's hard to compare though, since many people have natural immunity or vaccine immunity and there are many versions of flu also
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: word for word, lol
 MSmits: you may laugh, but you are the one believing it's 100+ countries working together to create a giant conspiracy to make people believe there is a bad disease that doesn't exist. Sound far more laughable to me.
 MSmits: millions of doctors and scientists, all in on it
 MSmits: sure...
 ninjadip: like simulation theory? or just conspiracy theory?
 MSmits: it's a conspiracy theory
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Nah, just a little bit of greed mixed up with a some really good marketing and tons and tons of social media herd mentality
 ninjadip: oh man cause simulation theory is interesting 
 MSmits: obviously you don't have any clue about how science works Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: if you say so
 MSmits: scientists care more about truth than anyone in the world. I know because I am one. You can distrust   politics and media and rightly so, but not scientists. Or at least not scientific consensus
 MSmits: doesn't mean they cant be wrong. They can be wrong when there is too little information and they are having to make a best guess to inform policy
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you want to compare credentials?
 ninjadip: that's not bring people back from the dead
 MSmits: whats the point of that. I am not arguing from authority
 MSmits: I am just saying trust the science
 ninjadip: whatever you want to call it, they are dead. that's the truth. 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: all right, horse is well dead.  back to mcts
 jacek: pony dead?
 GPoll: Is there any way I can find a particular clash puzzle I want to try again?

 darkhorse64: MSmits: 100% in agreement with you
 ninjadip: everyone else is too, just walking on eggshells around you know who
 MSmits: thanks darkhorse64&#160;:)
 MSmits: voldemort?
 MSmits: I have been rewatching harry potter
 struct: isnt there a new movie?
 MSmits: mmh not sure, unless you mean those fantastic beasts spinoffs
 struct: ah no
 struct: its just a reunion of the cast it seems
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: I watch it for Snape mostly :P
 darkhorse64: The actor Alan Rickman is dead, unfortunately, no&#160;? 
 struct: yes
 MSmits: yeah he is
 MSmits: I just think he is awesome in HP
 struct: yeah he plays the role very well
 struct: from what I can remember
 darkhorse64: Even in the book, his death is one of the most striking moments
 MSmits: yeah i also read the books,  but only  1 time each, saw the movies multiple times
 MSmits: kinda like lotr, only read those once, maybe twice, but saw the movies like 5 times or something
 MSmits: good fantasy productions used to be rare, but the last 20 yrs or so there have been some really good ones
 darkhorse64: 3 times for me (including the hobbit) and read the books twice
 MSmits: ah yeah, the hobbit is a quick read
 MSmits: still amazes me they got 3 moves out of that
 MSmits: movies
 darkhorse64: Scenario writers are quite talented
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, especially since they must have used the best ones
 MSmits: they also madea show of wheel of time recently
 MSmits: i read all those books, but those books are huge. They try to do 1 book in 8 episodes, but they still need to skip and change a ton or it would never fit
 darkhorse64: A true discovery for me. Looks interesting
 therealbeef: just wish the book-fans would stop whining about it in the series/movies reviews&#160;:-P
 therealbeef: (about changes, new scenes, etc)
 ninjadip: same with porn, the movies never live up to the stories in the magazines
 therealbeef: I should quote Jacky Treehorn now
 jacek: again with the books talking
 MSmits: yeah i had to stop myself from being annoyed at the changes, but they had good reasons for it i guess.
 MSmits: it's a good show if you can ignore them
 struct: you just need to watch the show first and then read the book
 struct: then you wont be disapointed
 jacek: or create the book yourself
 mkkhell: :yum:

 Big_Code: Hey folks, been googling around for a while and can't find an answer to my issue. Could anyone tell me why pandas 'duplicated()' works fine on Test 3, but totally different on Test 4? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/YedM2F4a">https://pastebin.com/YedM2F4a</a>
 5DN1L: I suspect duplicated() doesn't care whether your duplicates are one immediately after the other or not
 Slanda: im rank one but im not ranking up, does anyone else have this issue?
 jacek: where
 Slanda: wood 1 bb
 5DN1L: what does bb mean?
 Slanda: baby
 n0b1e: slang for baby 
 Slanda: but fr shouldnt i rank up if im rank one?
 Slanda: i thought thats how it worked
 Big_Code: I see how it could be doing that, but what really confuses me is what duplicates does it see? in Test 3 it seems to recognize 150 as a duplicate, but in Test 4 I'm not sure what it thinks is a duplicate. 
 5DN1L: the y-coordinates are duplicated
 5DN1L: e.g. #0 and #17
 5DN1L: Slanda are you rank one AND above the boss?
 5DN1L: jacek are you bb?
 jacek: Automaton2000 is bb
 Big_Code: Oh wow, i see that now. So it's finding the first duplicate (e.g. y 1500) and giving me every value in between until the next?
 Automaton2000: i'm used to the website
 5DN1L: Big_Code, I don't think so
 Slanda: 5DN1L thats what it shows on the ranking ladder
 jacek: Slanda what game? and yes, if youre above boss after submit is done you should advance league
 5DN1L: I think all can be paired up
 Slanda: pod racing
 jacek: the submit isnt finished
 jacek: it needs to play 90 games or so
 Slanda: its kinda strange I sometimes jump down from one to like 150 but if i test it again Ill just back up
 5DN1L: yes, Slanda look at the leaderboard
 5DN1L: your games are still being played
 5DN1L: scoring not yet finished
 Slanda: ooooohhhhhh
 Slanda: the battles in progress thing?
 Slanda: 445%
 5DN1L: yes
 Slanda: thank you for that clarification
 Slanda: I was so confused
 5DN1L: no problem
 jacek: 445%? oO
 Slanda: 45**
 5DN1L: Wontonimo's sticky keyboard
 Slanda: ayyy we got the rank up
 Slanda: moving up in the world into bronze
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 jacek: :tada:
 Big_Code: 5DN1L I'm not sure I get what you mean, I see that #0 and #17 are duplicated. But all the data in between seems, (to me) randomly chosen. Heres a paste with an example, the first 10 sets of data, showing which are excluded. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/pVmRb2Rs">https://pastebin.com/pVmRb2Rs</a>I probably just can't see it, but I can't tell why its separating the data this way
 5DN1L: Based on your last pastebin link, I see these pairs: 0 &amp; 17, 2 &amp; 13, 7 &amp; 12, 8 &amp; 11, 10 &amp; 14, 15 &amp; 16
 5DN1L: Each pair has the same y-coordinate
 Big_Code: oh wow, this is why having a 2nd set of eyes is great. been staring at this for hours and probably why I didnt notice
 Big_Code: Totally understand your last message now, so it doesn't care at all if they are back to back
 5DN1L: that's right&#160;:)
 Big_Code: You rock, I think I know my next steps now. Thanks for your time! I'll probably be back in the future with more random questions :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L: Heehee sure
 JavaliMZ: can we import modules in codingame python interpreter? like easydict

 ASM_MOV_INT: found one... oh, and yeah lol
 5DN1L: interesting approach

 Wontonimo: I've got hints ...
 Wontonimo: :wave: Keve1991.  Haven't seen you around before.  Nice level
 struct: hi Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: hey struct&#160;!  
 justchris: Wontonimo, I'm thinking about doing Tron soon, just started with code royale
 justchris: are you allowed to take hints&#160;? i took some hints for Mad pod racing here a few days back
 Wontonimo: cool!  I didn't get very far with code royal
 Wontonimo: yeah, hints are fine
 Wontonimo: sharing full code is not
 Wontonimo: (other than for total noobs struggling with "The Descent")
 justchris: great, when you asked me last time and i saw you were a moderator i thought i was gonna be in trouble xD
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: sharing ideas is great.  Especially if they are insightful (vs spoilers).  For example, a lot of people are interested in pushing their bitboard and mcts algos to the limits and back early this year you would have seen a storm of different ideas freely shared 
 Alex4200: ok i don't understand man
 Wontonimo: What have you been working on Alex4200&#160;?  Any puzzles or bot battles?
 Alex4200: working bot battle
 Wontonimo: which one?
 Alex4200: i dont know.
 justchris: you dont know how the system works?
 justchris: with leagues etc?
 Alex4200: artisans
 Wontonimo: just start on one, like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/connect-4</a>
 Wontonimo: use the default code to start, submit it, and see what it does
 Wontonimo: a random bot will actually beat a lot of other people.  So for connect 4, you can start by outputting a random number from 0-8
 Alex4200: ok i have join on ashketchum

 Astrobytes: :hugging:
 Wontonimo: jacek was sharing his new NN post.  really good stuff.  i'm still surprised i haven't jumped on the wagon considering it is my day job.  maybe thats why
 Astrobytes: that on tech.io?
 Astrobytes: and haha, yeah, most likely :D
 Wontonimo: yeah but still wip
 Astrobytes: Also, ML-based solutions are not applicable to all multis

 Wontonimo: no probs.  how's the multi going Hoshiny&#160;?
 Hoshiny: it was great,but I just join to be a coder(sorry that my English is poor)
 Hoshiny: pool
 Hoshiny: haha
 Wontonimo: have you done much coding before coming here?
 Hoshiny: yes, but I think is not pretty much
 Wontonimo: what programming language are you using?
 Chito[patito: javascript
 Hoshiny: python
 Hoshiny: haha
 Wontonimo: both are good and I use both at work
 haengbokhae: is Ruby a good language to look for an entry position for programmer?
 justchris: wow time flies so fast
 Wontonimo: i dont know
 Wontonimo: hey justchris, you haven't fixed your gold bot in mad pod racing
 justchris: fixed how?
 Wontonimo: they are not working properly
 Wontonimo: die on frame 1
 justchris: yeah i didnt make code for 2 pods, just 1
 zakacat: Does anyone else write out their algorithms by hand sometimes?
 Wontonimo: how else would you do it?
 zakacat: in the IDE?
 zakacat: commented out maybe
 zakacat: I am not sure. I hadn't assumed it was common to do so
 ASM_MOV_INT: i write pseudo code in IDE, then comment and create as I go...&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: do you mean your write it down on paper, with a writing implement of some nature like they did when they lived in caves?
 zakacat: haha, yah
 zakacat: exactly, chisel and stone over here
 zakacat: JK, I like my pencil and paper
 ASM_MOV_INT: my host enjoys the tactile sensation of writing...!
 zakacat: I also find it comforting. I like sketching when I can. Plus, I am still not a very strong typist
 zakacat: Host? Liiiikkee accomodation?
 ASM_MOV_INT: ....rofl, that was a stargate sg-1 reference
 Wontonimo: host, like fleshy meat bag that he inhabits
 zakacat: Haha, well I was just trying not to be rude
 ASM_MOV_INT: Anise of the tok'ra said that in one of the episodes when questioned about using a pen and computerized tablet
 zakacat: And her race is parasitic?
 ASM_MOV_INT: yes, benevolently so also.
 ASM_MOV_INT:&#160;:)
 zakacat: Gotcha
 ASM_MOV_INT: don't mind me, i'm on too much coffee
 Wontonimo: benevolently parasitic ... oxymoron 
 zakacat: Yah, like, can they host a corpse?
 ASM_MOV_INT: lol... in the series? no
 zakacat: Or are they symbiotic?
 zakacat: with the host
 ASM_MOV_INT: symbiotic
 ASM_MOV_INT: it's a great show
 ASM_MOV_INT: years ago, i checked out the first season from the local library.... ended up becoming a huge fan, bought the entire series, and the offshoots too, stargate atlantis, and stargate universe... and the movies
 Wontonimo: lies, they toss the used meat mech once it is of no use 
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 zakacat: Sounds similar to Star Trek. I will have to check it out some time
 zakacat: hahaha, meat mech. Now there is an oxymoron
 ASM_MOV_INT: i'm a huge trekkie too yes
 Wontonimo: "oh, we are so civilized.  the meat mechs are totally willing, breed that way and those who arnt are ... made to do other things ..."
 Wontonimo: symbiotic nope.  just good at PR
 zakacat: lol
 ASM_MOV_INT: indeed
 Wontonimo: tbh, I'd like to be such an immortal parasite in a world of 8 billion meat mechs.   Better than being a vampire
 zakacat: More freedom, less power
 ASM_MOV_INT: today kid's, our phrase of the day is: meat mech

 e_fishel: YOOO
 e_fishel: wontonimo
 e_fishel: i did it
 Wontonimo: cool cool!
 e_fishel: 100% :OOOOOOOO
 e_fishel: i'm startled
 Wontonimo: maybe try a multi?  do you like Tron?

 kavishka: hii
 struct: js should be able to do a decent job there
 Wontonimo: some people turn left, some people turn right.  fools only go straight
 kavishka: am new to codinggame
 Wontonimo: yes it should
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: hey new to codingame, i'm dad
 kavishka: hello 
 UZUHAMA: hey
 kavishka: am having trouble with temperature game
 struct: whats the problem?
 UZUHAMA: why can't you compare null to int?
 UZUHAMA: :thinking:
 e_fishel: idk
 struct: which language?
 UZUHAMA: java
 struct: an integer cant be null
 UZUHAMA: I don't believe Java initially assigns a number to a variable
 UZUHAMA: Then why not?
 struct: it assigns 0
 struct: default value is 0
 UZUHAMA:&#160;???/
 UZUHAMA: What the .....
 Wontonimo: java puts safety bumpers on everything
 UZUHAMA: What if you assign int variable a null value?
 UZUHAMA: for example
 Wontonimo: int is a primitive, so no.  but Integer can be set to null
 Wontonimo: but dont
 UZUHAMA: when hashmap doesn't exist and I assign it anyway to the int?
 UZUHAMA: It's not giving me an any error
 UZUHAMA: Then the value should be null, right?
 struct: can you paste a code snippet?
 Wontonimo: just a shorrt part
 UZUHAMA: k
 UZUHAMA: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3607c5b3-1115-4717-998c-aabf1a7d522a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3607c5b3-1115-4717-998c-aabf1a7d522a</a>
 UZUHAMA: so confused :disappointed:
 struct: so its Integer you are using right?
 struct: not int
 UZUHAMA: I'm using int
 Wontonimo: this works better
 Wontonimo: for(String word&#160;: words){	if (!dictionary.containsKey(word)) dictionary.put(word, 0);	dictionary.put(word, dictionary.get(word) + 1);}
 UZUHAMA: There's a method for checking keys
 UZUHAMA: I didn't know that...
 Wontonimo: it's tricky to find
 Wontonimo: you have to type both "java" and "hashmap" into google at the same time
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html</a>
 UZUHAMA: That's a long document
 struct: I cant seet to create hashmap&lt;int,int&gt;
 struct: but Integet,Integer works fine
 UZUHAMA: But surely it'll be useful
 UZUHAMA: Oh the hashmap
 UZUHAMA: It is &lt;String, Integer&gt;
 UZUHAMA: I thought you were talking about variable
 UZUHAMA: srry
 struct: ah
 struct: the get can return a null
 struct: int value = dictionary.get(word);
 struct: but this line wont work
 UZUHAMA: yeah
 struct: since it will return null if it doesnt exist
 UZUHAMA: it gives me an error
 struct: and int cant have null value
 UZUHAMA: exactly!
 struct: if you replace int by Integer it should work
 UZUHAMA: Objects can be null?
 UZUHAMA: Not the primitive types?
 struct: I dont know java very well sorry
 UZUHAMA: Nah, no need to be sorry
 UZUHAMA: You still taught me useful things
 Wontonimo: no you cant
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/2B6tPBR">https://tech.io/snippet/2B6tPBR</a>
 Wontonimo: int x = null;is an error
 Wontonimo: but Integer x = null;is fine
 UZUHAMA: yeah
 UZUHAMA: struct just taught me that :kissing_smiling_eyes:
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: i was busy making the example while struct stone my thunder
 UZUHAMA: haha
 Wontonimo: shame on you struct&#160;!  shame&#160;!

 struct: should work?
 Wontonimo: but the count will be wrong
 struct: yes
 e_fishel: alright everyone, imma go sleep
 Wontonimo: it will start at zero
 e_fishel: cya
 Wontonimo: cya
 UZUHAMA: It is working
 UZUHAMA: but Wontonimo's right
 struct: dont you only need to change this 0 to 1?
 struct: dictionary.put(word, 0);
 UZUHAMA: well, that's true
 Wontonimo: that'll never work.  that's crazy talk
 UZUHAMA: hahaha
 struct: but im sure theres better way to do this
 UZUHAMA: yeah
 Wontonimo: i like my way
 struct: but I only used java when I had to use the sdk here
 UZUHAMA: Wontonimo just showed me a way of using one of the method of HashMap
 UZUHAMA: containsKey
 UZUHAMA: I definitely should read the documentation Wontonimo gave me...
 UZUHAMA: It's going to take a while
 UZUHAMA: Anyway
 struct: everytime I look at java I get more scared
 UZUHAMA: haha
 UZUHAMA: (i don't understand why)
 UZUHAMA: But anyway
 UZUHAMA: Thanks for today's lesson, guys

 ManeatingGiant_d83c: hej
 ManeatingGiant_d83c: kocham accessa 
 Uljahn: use english here
 ZXC01: talk in #poland
 Urutar: Well, apparently he seems to love access, which he might lose, if he doesn't tell that in english XD
 Urutar: Only might, though
 DialFrost: still trying for legend in mad lol
 jacek: thats mad
 Urutar: Do or do not, there is no try XD
 5DN1L: I'm curious whether anyone can get to Legend in Mad aka csb with a bunch of ifs only? Or is some kind of simulation always needed?
 DialFrost: er
 DialFrost: i think its possible to get to legend with only ifs
 DialFrost: pretty hard tho
 Urutar: Well, any ai basically is just a bunch of ifs - very clever ifs sometimes, but nonetheless ifs
 Urutar: I wouldn't just write spaghetti-ifs though
 5DN1L: Ah by ifs I mean simple ifs without simulation and/or genetic algorithm and/or neural network or any machine-learning stuff
 Urutar: It gets very complicated later on with multiple  bots
 Urutar: Well, it is supposedly possible
 Urutar: It would mean many, many ifs
 Urutar: So much spaghetti code, you could feed some third world country for years
 jacek: wontomino said it is possible
 Urutar: :D
 jacek: that is, without simulation
 DialFrost: rn i have 1 if statement lol
 Urutar: Well, you gotta increase those numbers XD
 DialFrost: and im rank 700 (was actually now im 1k bad luck i think)
 DialFrost: lol
 Urutar: Lemme check my rank real quick
 jacek: youre in gold?
 DialFrost: yes
 DialFrost: rank 700 in gold
 DialFrost: not entire thing lol
 jacek: oh
 DialFrost: if it was i'd be in legend by now
 DialFrost: bout 1k ppl in legend
 DialFrost: the rest of the 139,000 are split amongst the rest
 5DN1L: DialFrost, do you intend to write just more simple ifs, or do you intend to dive into the more complex word of algorithms and machine learning stuff?
 DialFrost: er idk
 5DN1L: world*
 DialFrost: kinda both
 5DN1L: For the latter, you'd better be prepared to spend a lot more time on learning and practising then :wink:
 Jerrasterix: well, I have just bunch of  if else and some math function.... and I am in 95&#160;:)
 Jerrasterix: well 94th today :P
 5DN1L: :clap: :thumbsup:
 Jerrasterix: Ohh.... Wait I do simulate... sorrryyyy!
 5DN1L: lol
 Jerrasterix: I have a drifting function, to drift and thus save time turning
 Jerrasterix: you have to simulate for it... I completely forgot that 
 5DN1L: It's difficult not to simulate to get to higher leagues, isn't it
 jacek: eeyup
 Uljahn: simulation level of detail can vary, my first one had only no-thrust movement ignoring collisions
 jacek: oware abapa, once again a tutorial game
 5DN1L: Uljahn, indeed, that's a good point
 LeGourdin: is that normal that there isn't any solution for this puzzle&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/binary-tree-visual">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/binary-tree-visual</a>&#160;?
 derjack: you can see solutions once you solve it
 5DN1L: And it's a newly approved puzzle
 5DN1L: So very few have solved it
 derjack: i see at least 3 solutions, but i cant access them because i havent solved it yet
 derjack: community success rate 67%. though you can choose not to share solutions
 DialFrost: does anyone here have a way to make sure my pod in mad pod racing turns the right way
 5DN1L: write the right code?
 DialFrost: like this
 DialFrost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/596765530">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/596765530</a>
 DialFrost: at turn 10
 DialFrost: my bot is supposed to turn right to checkpoint 2
 DialFrost: instead it turns left
 DialFrost: and realises its turning the wrong way and corrects itself by looping
 DialFrost: however this wastes alot of time
 DialFrost: any explanation?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yup: There's an error in your code.
 DialFrost: there isnt
 DialFrost: its just that it turns randomly
 5DN1L: It doesn't turn randomly, it turns based on how your code tells it to move
 darkhorse64: It looks as if the next checkpoint is on the left and your pod prepares to that
 darkhorse64: sign error/index error/mixing x and y. It can be anything. Print your next target to check if it is right
 DialFrost: i dont think its any of them
 DialFrost: as the bot always turns back
 DialFrost: (hopefully)
 5DN1L: differs*
 darkhorse64: Don't think, check&#160;!
 5DN1L: ^ yes
 LelouchVC2: dont even check, just take a break. come back to it next year
 derjack: in 3 weeks?
 5DN1L: :joy:
 LelouchVC2: yes
 jude2k: don't think, just google and copypasta
 Llama.: Hello guys
 TheModified: yo!
 Andreseag: Hello guys
 asj1384: hello
 rekaxem: hi
 WillChang: ho
 lakaoe: print(((l * 100) + s)&#160;% 5)
 lakaoe: why is it printing zeros?
 jacek: because (I * 100) + s seems to be divisible by 5
 jacek:&#160;:?
 TheModified: if S is divisible by 5, and l is a whole number above 0, this statement will always print 0s
 lakaoe: ok i got it
 lakaoe: thx
 TheModified: Could anyone help with the puzzle called Temperatures? Not sure why I'm getting the output that i get
 Milanovich: Yeah i'll help u out
 TheModified: so test case 1, 2, 5 and 6 are working perfectly
 TheModified: but on 3 and 4 it prints the first number, 42
 Jerrasterix: bug&#160;!!!
 Milanovich: which isnt the lowest number
 TheModified: exactly
 TheModified: within the for-loop i check whether the absolute of the new input is lower or equal to the absolute of the previous closest-to-zero temperature
 TheModified: so abs(t) &lt;= abs(closestTemp)
 Milanovich: yeah
 TheModified: holy nevermind
 Milanovich: ^^ this usually happens, happy to help
 Stor77: Sorry to interrupt ^^ but I'm currently trying some loop task and, the test seem to doge my answer. When I have the correct answer the test says founr&#160;: "nothing" and something other than my result as expected but when I have it wrong it expects exactly what i put out when I have it right. What is this mockery?:zipper_mouth:
 5DN1L: there's something wrong with your code
 TheModified: @milan i checked &lt;= and then always saved the positive number (as required if both are as far from 0), but that was dumb..
 jacek: do you have extra prints or newlines?
 Stor77: i hava bunch of prints without any new lines, they all contribute to the final answer
 Stor77: but ive already had it with just one println
 Uljahn: consider using debug command from the comments
 Stor77: doesnt really help
 5DN1L: You can debug to see whether the code runs as expected
 Jerrasterix: which language&#160;??
 5DN1L: I usually add the debug code at various points
 Stor77: I also feel like the code template was weird, they just had a bunch of nextInt() readings in a loop without saving the values
 Stor77: It's java
 Stor77: Simple auto-scaling task
 Uljahn: you have to store the input data by yourself
 Stor77: yea that's what I did
 lakaoe: what does this mean
 lakaoe: unexpected EOF while parsingat Answer.py. not in a function on line 15
 TheModified: end of file reached
 Jerrasterix: share your code here please...
 lakaoe: my code
 jacek: some error in your code :v
 Jerrasterix: prolly a extra paranthesis 
 lakaoe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b9fb6df-abe1-48bf-9451-997042f97d50">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b9fb6df-abe1-48bf-9451-997042f97d50</a>
 Stor77: It literally changes the expected answer once I have it correct :joy:
 Stor77: Shouldn't the expected result always be the same though?
 jacek: oO
 jacek: depends if you reached the further line
 Uljahn: missing bracket
 5DN1L: it's a multi-line answer
 5DN1L: hence if you got one line right this time and another line wrong
 TheModified: are you supposed to overwrite the child's age every time?
 5DN1L: then you'll see some other expected value
 lakaoe: no
 Stor77: Mh ok.. I tried multiline at first but maybe back then my code was wrong
 5DN1L: it means an error in a different line Stor77
 Stor77: I'll give it another shot
 lakaoe: i got it i forgot the last )
 lakaoe: bruhhh
 jacek: :tada:
 switzerlandman: big chungus
 jacek: oO
 veer_viren: hii
 lakaoe: can someone help me with my code?
 jacek: someone, maybe, can, code
 5DN1L: Please ask and we'll see
 lakaoe: ok so
 lakaoe: the problem is
 lakaoe: you have to see if you have enough paint to paint the whole room
 lakaoe: the wall windows, just everything
 5DN1L: Erm... just give us the link
 5DN1L: and the issue with your code
 lakaoe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9cfe3044-3624-4eec-a507-9b020555c475">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9cfe3044-3624-4eec-a507-9b020555c475</a>

 lakaoe: even when it has to be false

 lakaoe: thats my code
 jacek: print("false") [solved]
 5DN1L: that means your code makes it always c&gt;w
 lakaoe: yeah
 5DN1L: try check whether c and w are calculated correctly
 lakaoe: c isnt calculated correcly
 lakaoe: but idk how to
 lakaoe: bc it says that 1 liter covers 5 m2
 lakaoe: so i do c= q * 5
 lakaoe: (q is how many liters)
 5DN1L: what is x * y * z
 lakaoe: the room
 5DN1L: do you pour the paint to fill the room?
 lakaoe: wdym
 Urutar: Well, maybe you should paint the walls
 lakaoe: i dont think so
 5DN1L: are you calculating volume or area?
 Urutar: And not fill the room with paint
 5DN1L: x * y * z is volume isn't it
 Urutar: Yep
 lakaoe: yeah
 lakaoe: thats why i do // 3.5
 Urutar: Well, what the are
 Urutar: Well
 lakaoe: and then * n
 5DN1L: what is the formula for area
 Urutar: If you're room is 2x2 on one side, 5x5 on the other and 1x1 opn the ceiling?
 Urutar: so 2x5x1 = 10
 Urutar: divided by 3.5 times n...
 5DN1L: somebody correct me if i'm thinking it wrong...
 Urutar: So around 2.8/5 liters needed to fill the room
 5DN1L: i don't think area = height x width x depth
 Urutar: But you want the are, not the volume
 Urutar: So the are of left, right, front, back wall and ceiling and floor
 Urutar: *area
 Urutar: Hmmm, lakaoe?
 lakaoe:&#160;?
 5DN1L: do you think area = height x width x depth?
 lakaoe: i am calculating it wrong
 5DN1L: lakaoe
 5DN1L: you consider each wall separately
 5DN1L: then the ceiling
 5DN1L: and the floor
 5DN1L: (actually why does the puzzle require the floor to be painted)
 Urutar: Or the ceiling, but eh
 5DN1L: the puzzle creator is close to pouring the paint all over the place
 lakaoe: thanks guys
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: a smell of paint prevails throughout
 eulerscheZahl: why would you not paint the ceiling?
 Automaton2000: someone can help me with the puzzle
 Urutar: Smell of something atleast
 Urutar: ^^
 jacek: Automaton2000 it's wednesday!
 Automaton2000: i mean you can go to a private chat
 5DN1L: because wednesday isn't coding related :smirk:
 jacek: its frog related
 Urutar: Automaton2000 Show me what you'Ve got!
 Automaton2000: and you have to calculate it
 Urutar: Well, that's not really schwifty.

 Wontonimo: jacek and BlaiseEbuth have been around here way longer than i have
 rekaxem: i dont like shortest mode 
 jacek: dont use java for shortest [solved]
 Wontonimo: you can ask me.  i didn't say "just not me".  I said "not just me"
 SteveThompson: Oh ok!
 SteveThompson: Here is my question
 SteveThompson: Do you use replit.com?
 Nick_Rogers: yep
 Nick_Rogers: I do
 SteveThompson: I didn't ask Nick
 SteveThompson: I asked Wontonimo
 Nick_Rogers: bruh
 Nick_Rogers: I do though use replit
 rekaxem: i dont understand why shortest mode exists
 SteveThompson: I didn't ask tho
 SteveThompson: I asked someone else
 Nick_Rogers: aye Steve, I do use it
 Nick_Rogers: and so what.....
 Nick_Rogers: WHAT
 SteveThompson: Nice good for you
 Nick_Rogers: NO
 Nick_Rogers: U ASKED FOR A REASON
 Nick_Rogers: WHYYYY
 SteveThompson: I don't know
 Nick_Rogers: DON'T BE MEANNN
 SteveThompson: How??
 SteveThompson: I'm not
 Nick_Rogers: U asked for my replit and now your not caring about it
 Nick_Rogers: COME ONNN
 5DN1L: calm down, gentlemen
 rekaxem: bruh
 Nick_Rogers: WHATS YOUR PROBLEMM MANNN
 SteveThompson: Yeah I don't care!
 Nick_Rogers: YOU NEED TO CARE

 Nick_Rogers: Same here
 ChristopherDing: no problem nick 
 Wontonimo: keep the conversation (mostly) focused on coding or codingame
 jacek: is this holiday from school yet?
 Wontonimo: generally stay on topic
 SteveThompson: Oh yes.
 rekaxem: i think shortest mode is the only reason i couldnt get top 200 in clash of code
 Nick_Rogers: What is shortest mode?
 rekaxem: like
 Wontonimo: code gulfing
 rekaxem: yes
 Nick_Rogers: code gulfing?
 Nick_Rogers: ok
 rekaxem: make your code as short as possible
 Nick_Rogers: ohhhh

 SteveThompson: Cheating is wrong
 rekaxem: i dnot see why you wanna do that tho
 SteveThompson: It won't get you anywhere
 BlaiseEbuth: Na. I think you can't get top 200 in clash of code because you're not good enough in shortes mod...
 SteveThompson: Cheating won't get you to anywhere
 SteveThompson: If you cheat, you won't get ahead
 Nick_Rogers: Cheating gets u to a lot of places
 rekaxem: actually
 ChristopherDing: SteveThompson Stop
 Nick_Rogers: In school for example
 SteveThompson: Oh sorry moderator ChristopherDing
 ChristopherDing: SteveThompson is being mean
 Nick_Rogers: It helps if u don't get caught
 SteveThompson: ChristopherDing you're moderator right?
 rekaxem: cheating is probably slower than just doing it properly for fastest/reverse mode
 SteveThompson: If yes, I am sorry
 Nick_Rogers: I agree rekaxem
 ChristopherDing: SteveThompson is accusing me of being a mod
 Nick_Rogers: Wait
 BlaiseEbuth: Awful...
 struct: stop with this useless spam
 Nick_Rogers: Undercover Mod????
 SteveThompson: So is it a yes?
 SteveThompson: oh no please sorry struct
 struct: next one?
 Nick_Rogers: next what?
 BlaiseEbuth: Back on my days everybody would already been banned... :older_man:
 Wontonimo: stop or be kicked
 lakaoe: answer sheet would be usefull for me
 TeslaRam: go to private conversation

 struct: Dont put clash links here
 rekaxem: oh sorry
 struct: np
 Nick_Rogers: If u do, u might get banned
 5DN1L: rekaxem use #clash channel
 BlaiseEbuth: struct: You know normal users doesn't see kick/ban message right&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Nick_Rogers: Someome got banned?
 struct: yes
 Nick_Rogers: Did Christopher get banned?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Nick_Rogers: Oh
 struct: no
 struct: wasnt him
 Nick_Rogers: Who was the other person here
 Wontonimo: sorry steve
 Nick_Rogers: Oh yeahhhh
 Nick_Rogers: Steve
 <b>**rekaxem what is this</b></p><p><img src="/a/75083329618010" /> ThompsonSteve: Hey I'm back guys!
 5DN1L: rekaxem click #clash to go to that chatroom for clash links
 ThompsonSteve: I just went to the bathroom
 Nick_Rogers: Oh
 Nick_Rogers: Thats good
 rekaxem: ok
 Nick_Rogers: I thought u got banned
 BlaiseEbuth: struct: The point was that when you're sayin "Next one?", targeted people don't know what you're talking about.
 Nick_Rogers: Thank god
 ThompsonSteve: I didn't get banned
 Nick_Rogers: Oh
 Nick_Rogers: Good
 ThompsonSteve: I just went to the bathroom since I had to poop so badly
 Nick_Rogers: Uhhhhh
 ThompsonSteve: As I was sitting in my chair
 ThompsonSteve: It kept on sliding out
 5DN1L: coding topics, please
 Nick_Rogers: I agree
 Nick_Rogers: This has gotten out of hand
 williamlii: faxs
 rekaxem: what language is best for shortest mode
 tridov: yuuur
 Nick_Rogers: Python
 struct: ruby, perl, bash, python
 Nick_Rogers: "Ruby on rails"
 Nick_Rogers: Python is better 
 Nick_Rogers: my fav tbh
 Nick_Rogers: In second I like java
 rekaxem: i only know c++
 5DN1L: also depends on how skilled you are in the language. otherwise you have to learn a new language just for golfing
 Nick_Rogers: Correct
 TeveShompson: Correct
 Nick_Rogers: WWHATTT
 Nick_Rogers: UR BACK?
 Nick_Rogers: I thought u got banned
 Nick_Rogers: 2 times
 BlaiseEbuth: Scatophilia is a fetish like any others...
 tridov: hola mi nombre es Pablo
 TeveShompson: Yeah sorry I had to take a bigger one this time in the bathroom
 TeveShompson: It was really hard
 5DN1L: sigh
 tridov: como estas amigos?
 TeveShompson: It was slipping so much
 TeveShompson: But at the same time I was constipated
 TeveShompson: AKLSDFNALKFNAKLFNEKLAFA
 TeveShompson: F
 5DN1L: I hope some mod sees this
 Nick_Rogers: Yep
 Wontonimo: thanks 5DN1L
 BlaiseEbuth: As I said, back in my days...
 tridov: adios 
 Wontonimo: kicked
 5DN1L: tridov use English or go to another language channel
 rekaxem: i hope next 2 clashes i play wont be shortest mode
 5DN1L: good luck!
 rekaxem: bruh
 rekaxem: this is sad
 jacek: hm?
 rekaxem: got shortest mode
 rekaxem: and its some annoying string processing
 jacek: aww
 5DN1L: sometimes it turns out well because all the other players do not get 100% at all
 5DN1L: keep going rekaxem
 rekaxem: thanks
 rekaxem: i think that might happen
 5DNIL: yea i think so
 jacek: :thinking:
 rekaxem: but i saw 2 people using ruby
 rekaxem: kinda scared
 lakaoe: :scream:
 5DN1L: huh? someone steals my logo???
 lakaoe: second 5dn1l
 5DNIL: who stole my logo???
 rekaxem: wait what
 5DNIL: i need to know!!
 rekaxem: theres 5DNIL and 5DN1L
 lakaoe: ik
 5DNIL: I'm the real one
 5DNIL: hes just trying to be funny
 5DNIL: by pretending to be me
 5DNIL: i think u should ban
 5DNIL: honestly its very childish
 lakaoe: omg yes ikr soo true
 5DNIL: btw guys
 5DNIL: do you guys know the language DN?
 rekaxem: dont
 ChristopherDing: whats DN?
 5DNIL: are you sure?\
 lakaoe: wow
 5DNIL: DN is DEEEZ NUTS GOTTEMETMEME

 Uljahn: Wontonimo lol
 Vigossive: hi
 rekaxem: ok great theres a ruby sweat
 Vigossive: how to hello world in haskell
 KayDroingAlien: hello, Im new to proggraming, is there like language lesson in this website? I'd like to learn C
 Uljahn: this site is meant for practice
 Uljahn: but you can try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn">https://www.codingame.com/learn</a>
 KayDroingAlien: oh, okay thanks
 NVamp: Hi can anyone help me with something I want to know about C#
 rekaxem: WHY IS IT SHORTEST MODE AGAIN
 Uljahn: git gud at shortest [solved]
 rekaxem: wow so helpful
 Uljahn: pls stop whining
 jacek: why it is shortest again... thats what she said
 Husoski: uh, what she shouted...
 lakaoe: :relieved:
 rekaxem: am i allowed to send code here
 Uljahn: for what purpose?
 Uljahn: has anybody asked for this?
 rekaxem: actually
 rekaxem: where are the rules 
 jacek: Oo
 Uljahn: type /help
 rekaxem: ok thanks
 BlaiseEbuth: You know, I want to be in the world's triathlon top200, but I suck at swimming. So instead of training, when it's natation time, I stay next to the pool complaining to the public and security agents about those stupid waterish events and how they prevent me to be well ranked...
 jacek: is this related to coding?
 rekaxem: yes
 rekaxem: they are trying to say i shouldnt complain about being bad at shortest mode
 Uljahn: you can stop playing clashes or play private ones
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_IO3hbU73U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_IO3hbU73U</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Smoking isn't good for you Uljahn...
 rekaxem: :flushed:
 draco-the-dragon: can we make our own games on this
 5DN1L: Yes, you can, when your level is high enough or the number of clashes you take part in is high enough
 BlaiseEbuth: Anybody can become mod those days...
 5DN1L: :shrug:
 Uljahn: Anybody can lose his mod rights...
 draco-the-dragon: yep
 BlaiseEbuth: Nope. Only a mod can.
 rekaxem: such profound words
 Nabgets: heyyyyy
 rekaxem: is there a function called startswith() in python
 5DN1L: yes
 rekaxem: oh
 5DN1L: i never use it though
 5DN1L: easy enough to use [0] instead
 rekaxem: is there any faster way to check if a string is a prefix of another string
 5DN1L: in most cases
 rekaxem: i mean shorter
 5DN1L: is [0] or [:x] good enough for you?
 rekaxem: oh[:x]
 rekaxem: thanks
 Steph.Curry: SHEEEEEESH
 Easyor14: weeeesh
 josemourinho: sheeeesh another win for me
 Steph.Curry: no no be realistic bro
 josemourinho: :muscle:
 rekaxem: is it possible to input float in ruby/perl/anything
 AntiSquid: what do you mean by input float&#160;? 
 Schwase: to read a float from the input? yes
 Husoski: gets.to_f, maybe?
 Schwase: i think they probably were asking about what they could have in a contribution for the input
 Husoski: oops...just saw the "in ruby" part.
 Schwase: whether or not it would cause a problem for people using languages that they arent familiar with
 Schwase: about to get silver in great escape and get the achievement and be soooo pumped about it
 Schwase: wait... even if i get 1st place it still isnt good enough to advance&#160;:(
 Schwase: spoiler, i didnt advance
 Schwase: rip
 jacek: oO
 Schwase: i know its not gonna be too hard to improve my code but i was really hoping i could get away with making some kind of low effort generalizations
 5DN1L: maybe you'll think of one after you leave it for a while and get back to it later?
 Schwase: yeah thats fair. sometimes you beat a puzzle to death and just come back after a week and just nail it on the first try. i'm pretty close already but at least i know that if i really want to i can just put in the effort to improving it
 5DN1L: That's the spirit :thumbsup:
 struct: if im a mod anyone can be a mod&#160;:)
 Schwase: when the boss had a score of like 27 not too long ago and now its up to 31 D:
 Wontonimo: it's just relative really.  means there are more people in that one league
 5DN1L: Or maybe somebody tried hard to fight the boss and failed and pushed it high up
 Wontonimo: the highest score you can have in a league is about 8 points higher than second place.  So, if there are only 2 people and one is 0, the other is at most 8
 Wontonimo: more people mean a higher max possible score
 Schwase: so if my score is 1st (excluding the boss), does that push up the boss's score?
 aangairbender: If I click "Play my code" then the code is saved on cg servers? I mean If I login from another PC will I see my code? Or I must submit for this?
 Schwase: because the boss is at 31.64 and 2nd place (i.e. behind me) is at 24.10
 5DN1L: the boss's score is affected by the wins and losses it have against individual players
 5DN1L: it has*
 5DN1L: aangairbender you just have to play it, you don't have to submit it
 aangairbender: ok thanks
 Schwase: yeah its just that one time the boss got like a 26/27 and now it got a 31, im between those ranges so i got unlucky (at least i think based on my updated understanding of the leaderboard)
 Schwase: so just submitting again and hoping for better rng, it just seemed strange that with so many matches there could be that large of a variance possible to occur
 5DN1L: you may observe how the boss's score changes when you play against it :wink:
 Schwase: wontimo i think its 7.5 points
 Schwase: 31.84 - boss score24.34 - 2nd place score
 AntiSquid: Schwase sorry for late reply regarding input float, but it's unclear where and how he's having trouble with it, you can also only guess, ambiguous questions are most difficult 
 Schwase: i remember there was a really good post about question etiquette on the discord server, i wish i had the link to it still, i looked for it a month or so back with no luck
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 Schwase: awesome. bookmarked for future use
 Uljahn: btw it's in the topic of the main channel
 Uljahn: i mean the codingame channel description on discord
 Schwase: ahh makes sense
 L00HP: GLHF guys
 Dren: good evening
 e_fishel: hey guys
 e_fishel: what is the website that has all codingame puzzles indexed
 e_fishel: and it also has clash of code
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 e_fishel: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: a random ping. hi :wave:
 jacek: ohayou
 jacek: wednesday ping?
 5DN1L: hi, your link has helped many
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you like to ping people?
 Automaton2000: my solution is a list
 eulerscheZahl: initially i wrote it to help myself with puzzle moderation. pointing out duplicates when refusing
 5DN1L: I think some approvers do this duplicate check with your link too now
 e_fishel: i'd like to flag a problem
 Astrobytes: Even some creators.
 e_fishel: it's ridiculous for reverse moode
 e_fishel: and i just played it
 NinjaS_AmaL: Any ruby programmers?
 e_fishel: and out of the 8 clashers, none could get 100% and bruted forced it
 NinjaS_AmaL: Do anyone know why each_with_index doesn't work on IDE
 5DN1L: e_fishel  remember you can rate the clash after it is over
 e_fishel: i did
 e_fishel: will that change the way it works?
 5DN1L: enough downvotes will disable it
 Astrobytes: It'll be removed from the clash pool with enough downvotes
 e_fishel: alright
 Sideway: "Failure: you are too late. Joker's bombs exploded. The hostages are dead. You lose&#160;:(Batman moved from window (0,0) to window (0,0)"
 Sideway: Nice batman&#160;:')
 5DN1L: Too tired to move? :smirk:
 Sideway: Seems like printf is not up to date&#160;:')
 5DN1L: Ah, I see :joy:
 Sideway: hmm there is something weird in that "Shadow of the Knight - Episode 1" problem
 Sideway: has any of you experienced a failure in the last test&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but it turned out that my own code was at fault
 Sideway: i just recalled it was all about dichotomia
 jacek: binary search?
 Schwase: came back after a break. easily beat the boss
 Sideway: hmm seems like i need to do a dichotomic search instead of my simple "go towards bomb"
 Schwase: yeah its not nearly as easy as the previous batman puzzle
 jacek: ep2?
 Schwase: yeah
 Sideway: as for me i'm at stage 1, discovering the challenge =)à
 jacek: use the search to search for a right algorithm
 Sideway: havent done such an algorithm for like 10 years&#160;:') That's why i do like these codingame problems :D
 jacek: oO
 DJBlueMysteryVanDerSwag_edfb: god
 ReallySmallartist: hopefully everyone is having a great day
 Firestormninja: likewise bigman
 lakaoe: why are there so many ASCII CoC's :sob:
 5DN1L: You mean ASCII art?
 lakaoe: yeah and just where you have to print the sum of the ASCII value of ABC
 lakaoe: and those things
 5DN1L: What do you think of them?
 lakaoe: i hate it bc i dont know how to do them xd
 5DN1L: Ah, then maybe you should practise more :smirk:
 jacek: :scream:
 lakaoe: :rolling_eyes:
 lakaoe: nice
 lakaoe: i got 60% for just printing the answer
 lakaoe: how to fix eof when reading a line
 5DN1L: make sure you don't read more times than you are required
 Schwase: also closing parentheses
 lakaoe: amd what is that
 lakaoe: nvmm

 Nicky_99: oh large texts go as a separate page.. understandable
 5DN1L: Yes that's right Nicky_99, multi-line text becomes a pastebin link
 5DN1L: It's not all clashes on this website, you may try other stuff too
 lakaoe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54bbf4fd-67ab-4e48-89ab-5711b147103d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/54bbf4fd-67ab-4e48-89ab-5711b147103d</a>
 lakaoe: how to sum the 
 lakaoe: numbers above eachother 
 lakaoe: could someone help?
 5DN1L: Have you tried yourself?
 lakaoe: yes but im a complete beginner so idk how
 lakaoe: not complete but i almost know nothing
 5DN1L: Yet you have finished &gt;100 clashes :smirk:
 Sideway: if (knowledge == NULL) goto ChatBox;&#160;:')
 lakaoe: yeah but i still dont know a single thing about coding lol
 5DN1L: These pieces of information do fit each other nicely, yeah? :joy:
 lakaoe: yes
 5DN1L: split the string, convert to integers, add them index by index, join them again if needed in your language
 Nicky_99: yeah its just the quest map who told me to go on a multiplayer. im 3rd year in university and we just learn web developing(js,php,mysql-yeah ik mysql and php is old but its just the educational system), basics in c++, and python, and a little bit of AI, so i just came here to check if its possible to improve my skillls in a game manner as i like games
 lakaoe: do i use the len() function
 Sideway: wow then you do know more things than me&#160;! you are certainly not a beginner as i am&#160;:')
 5DN1L: lakaoe, possibly needed
 Nicky_99: and ofc i hope in finding more challenges or puzzles here than competitive multiplayer games where i just lower my self confidence from seeing all those pros
 Nicky_99: and yeah i talk much, sry about that
 5DN1L: Sideway don't mix up the people lol
 5DN1L: they are two different people
 5DN1L: Nicky_99, it's fine to let us know your thoughts and your needs
 Sideway: woops, you right, i got tricked by the pp ^^ sorry :p
 5DN1L: Nicky_99, you may try out the solo puzzles
 5DN1L: some are for practise on your own, some others are more competitive in nature, but no time pressure
 Nicky_99: yeah ill have to set a pfp sooner or later, im 20 minutes old on this website after all, literally just typed coding game on google and this site popped up first
 5DN1L: right
 Sideway: better comes first&#160;;)
 5DN1L: get comfortable with the format of the puzzles on this website - it may be different from those you experience on other coding websites
 5DN1L: As some warm up, you may try the easy puzzles first
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 5DN1L: If you want I can further give you a list of those with hints, or if you want to explore a bit on your own first, it's also fine
 Nicky_99: well.. no currently im on no other coding websites than this. For my tasks i just use my basic knowledge, vscode syntax help/highlight and stack overflow/ language documentation in case i go into problems.
 5DN1L: I see
 5DN1L: Sounds great, stack overflow and language documentation are good sources of information
 Sideway: "Success: you defused the bombs in time. The hostages are safe. You win&#160;:)" Finally...
 5DN1L: Congrats Sideway&#160;:)
 Sideway: Thanks ^^
 Sideway: Is that allowed to do such a thing (in C)&#160;: bool val = (char*)*ptr &lt;&lt;(int)shift;
 Thib34: hi, i have a problem posting a comment.
 Thib34: i typed my message, but there is no button to send it, how are we supposed to do?
 Wenwu: whos here for swift&#160;?
 AlkhilJohn.: no apple devs here
 C26_1: Thib34, press enter
 C26_1: Ok, so I have a new way to learn code
 C26_1: Regex
 C26_1: What website can I use to find regex pracitce
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: I found it, Datacamp
 C26_1: Wait what. RegEx in datacamp are R proramming language
 C26_1: programming*
 C26_1: Yes
 C26_1: I find python regex
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 ZXC01: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: oh i see what you're saying

 ZXC01: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: eulerschezahl will you do a move in the search
 Automaton2000: ok but how do you make your own contest&#160;?
 Automaton2000: it's still a lot of sense
 Mortis_666: Automaton2000 hru
 Automaton2000: double free or corruption (out)
 skotz: lol
 ZXC01: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this is the very first turn
 ZXC01: Automaton2000
 ZXC01: Automaton2000
 ZXC01: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and they are all the people in the chat history
 ZXC01: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: eulerschezahl why are u coding in c++&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i guess they could have done that in a while
 Automaton2000: well i dont know if i need to beat everyone
 ZXC01: lol
 Mortis_666: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: there will be a fun game
 Wontonimo: oh wow, 4 people have already worked on my new game that has only been out for a few hours
 Mortis_666: what game
 DialFrost: late morning guys!
 DialFrost: wat game wontonimo
 Mortis_666: good late morning!
 Wontonimo: sticky keyboard
 DialFrost:&#160;?
 Mortis_666: o this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sticky-keyboard">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/sticky-keyboard</a>
 Wontonimo: the task is to correct text that was generated by someone with a bad keyboard
 DialFrost: found it
 Wontonimo: yeah
 DialFrost: imm a try it
 DialFrost: &lt;33
 Mortis_666: same
 Wontonimo: awesome!
 DialFrost: ok never mind i changed my mind
 DialFrost: lol
 ZXC01: lol
 ZXC01: really hard
 ZXC01: no
 DialFrost: its not that hard
 ZXC01: super hard
 DialFrost: js annoyingly hard
 DialFrost: wontonimo
 DialFrost: how come u still have 0%
 DialFrost: and yet drawrfie is already done
 DialFrost: hmmm he did it in PHP
 Wontonimo: I have the solution, yes.  But I don't like just copying my own solution to my puzzles.  Instead I wait at least a few days then try to do it without referencing my own solution
 DialFrost: hmm good idea
 Wontonimo: i sometimes come up with a much better solution.  sometimes i fail horribly
 Wontonimo: usually i just remember what i did
 DialFrost: lol
 DialFrost: nice bio btw
 Mortis_666: the one letter missing is confusing
 Dren: lol I never looked into machine learning and I have no clue how I would approach this
 Dren: probably set up a dictionary with a Trie tree or something
 DialFrost: ye
 DialFrost: same
 Wontonimo: oh, you are on the right track Dren.  There really isn't any machine learing in this
 DialFrost: bruh
 struct: its an interesting puzzle
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry.  i'll shut up
 DialFrost: haha lol
 ZXC01: hey
 ZXC01: i think westicles change profile picture a nd name
 ZXC01: i think this is him
 ZXC01: or her

 DialFrost: lol
 ZXC01: really
 Mortis_666: hm
 struct: o.o
 Dren: oh I think I get the machine learning part
 Dren: so if the text has 1 'moon' and 2 'mon 's I assume it's fine if the algo fixes the moon to mon since that's what it learns right?
 Dren: since other than frequency I see no way for it to decide whether a letter is missing or doubled in that case
 Dren: at least in theory I don't know if such cases are present in the tests or validators
 DialFrost: anybody do ruby and can help solve a problem i have in my code?
 DialFrost: im quite new to it
 Mortis_666: idk ruby much
 Mortis_666: only know a few little basics

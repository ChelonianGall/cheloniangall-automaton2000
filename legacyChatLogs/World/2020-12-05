 dbdr: why are there so many people with negative scores in wood 2 in onitama?
 dbdr: did the input format change over time?
 jacek: it doesnt provide possible inputs?
 dbdr: it does
 dbdr: tens of people at the bottom play invalid actions on turn 1
 jacek: maybe they cant get it right
 jacek: i got some problems for 2p player
 dbdr: ah, they play the stub I think
 dbdr: which has a hardcoded move, often invalid
 dbdr: "playiing the student"
 <b>**eulerscheZahl considers it a very bad practice to change input format after approval, wouldn't do that to my own games</b></p><p><img src="/a/43448306132121" /> dbdr: agreed
 <b>**dbdr agrees</b></p><p><img src="/a/29443769474274" /> MadKnight: then just come up with the best input format instantly

 eulerscheZahl: usually I get more than I even want
 dbdr: list of actions is often more than I want
 dbdr: but it's good for beginners, not complaining
 dbdr: I would not require it though, a pain to generate sometimes
 dbdr: idea: turn 1, bot sends its evali function as a string, and parameters
 dbdr: next turns, referee send best minimax move at the required depth for the given eval&#160;;)
 dbdr: *the minimax move, rather

 Revernus: *it was
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure you were amazing too
 Revernus: lol
 eulerscheZahl: but i agree CG added some nice features over the years
 eulerscheZahl: (i joined in 2016 so I don't know how it looked before)
 dbdr: noob
 eulerscheZahl: that's not very nice of you dbdr
 Uljahn: it looked somewhat scary for a noob like me back in 2014
 eulerscheZahl: i would expect that from Automaton
 dbdr: it is. I I said, I only call the most estimeed and experienced players noobs
 dbdr: that's the only way it is funny&#160;:)
 dbdr: oh, I'm the real noob: I had invalid moves because I printed twice per turn (left my old default action) :D
 eulerscheZahl: warning: you are not reading all input
 dbdr: indeed. the problem is we get that message too often
 dbdr: even when it's not true
 dbdr: so I ignored it
 eulerscheZahl: me too
 Revernus: back in 2014, I had no idea of most of the algorithms concepts. Today, I still don't, because I'm not a programmer lol

 eulerscheZahl: the boss is just to stop default codes from playing in the higher league

 eulerscheZahl: but i predict you'll get promoted soon
 dbdr: wild guess
 eulerscheZahl: and i predict a rank in top40
 dbdr: maybe I need to fix that bug first
 dbdr: what do you have. minimax?
 dbdr: and how deep?
 eulerscheZahl: depth 4 at the start
 dbdr: in 50ms right?
 dbdr: sounds low
 eulerscheZahl: i never said that i have a strong bot
 dbdr: Minimax(nodes: 66300, reached_depth: 7)
 eulerscheZahl: i think i subscribed to the RAIC newsletter too often
 dbdr: no bitboard
 eulerscheZahl: got 2 mails to 1 account and a third to another account
 eulerscheZahl: one day i should get back to onitama
 eulerscheZahl: right after vindinium :D
 darkhorse64: no bitboard :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: ban
 dbdr: and when vindinium? after what?
 eulerscheZahl: after RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't say after which RAIC
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 dbdr: depth 4 is #12, nice
 dbdr: any fancy eval?
 eulerscheZahl: fairly basic
 eulerscheZahl: unit count, staying in a group, getting closer to opponent base
 eulerscheZahl: and my eval includes a check for winning moves, so it's depth 5 actually
 dbdr: quiescence search
 dbdr: oh, there are draws at 200 turns
 eulerscheZahl: did you get one?
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: check the endscreen. it's different depending on the winner

 dbdr: wood 1 is big, but there are still large score differences at the top
 eulerscheZahl: looks like the game isn't close to being fully solved
 eulerscheZahl: except for those few starting configurations that tric trac gave me and that are removed now
 dbdr: didn't someone publish about it too?
 dbdr: not formally, but on a forum
 eulerscheZahl: yes, on boardgamegeeks forum
 eulerscheZahl: tric trac numbers match with the forum post
 eulerscheZahl: and that forum post also says that there are no solved states when you further increase the depth by 2
 jacek: yeah i tried that
 eulerscheZahl: wow, that's dedication
 jacek: dedication would be if i tried depth+3 or 4
 dbdr: this speaks about thousands of solved combinations, do you remove all of them?
 dbdr: I suppose they have parts in common
 eulerscheZahl: there are different sets of cards
 dbdr: distance to shrine does not seem to help much, or I did it wrong

 jacek: each square can have 80 states, times 25 = 2000 weights to tune

 eulerscheZahl: someone with exactly 1 skill according to the profile: MCTS
 eulerscheZahl: that's more than me, I have 0 skills
 dbdr: 0 | w | b | W | B = 5
 dbdr: why 80?
 eulerscheZahl: because you multiply the 5 by 16
 jacek: mobility. wether this square is attacked, protected, who's turn now, and if i recall, mobility from the center card as well
 jacek: so yeah, 4 additional bits
 dbdr: mobility from the center card to the shrine?
 dbdr: would make sense if you have the master there
 jacek: no. rather if the square is attacked/protected if player to move (or not to move?) could use center card

 eulerscheZahl: sorry trictraci saw it but didn't look into it&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: CG contest, then I wanted to finish BLockout, now RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: also wanted to have a closer look at JBM's Freecell. I starter writing a solver but didn't finish it
 trictrac: No problem, I will put one more month for comments
 LastRick: I came back to the Contribution page after the contest and its overwhelming. I want to approve/deny/work as many of these as I can but boy howdy, there's a lot to go through.
 eulerscheZahl: i always feel bad for ignoring a seemingly interesting contribution. for those boring clashes I don't care :D
 LastRick: ^
 eulerscheZahl: and I know it from the other side. Space Maze was pending for maybe 4 months
 eulerscheZahl: then one user with 3 accounts approved it
 JBM: eulerscheZahl: to think I even solved the C# compile issues for you…
 eulerscheZahl: the broken stub?
 JBM: yup
 eulerscheZahl: my solver should even be able to solve the easy testcase
 eulerscheZahl: but autoplay...
 Dagavin: anyone knows if in "chuck norris" puzzle the message I receive as input is already in binary, or I need to tranform it to binary?
 JBM: what about it?
 JBM: you need it off?
 JBM: that's one of the things i intended to have as an option
 eulerscheZahl: off would be more convenient for me
 eulerscheZahl: as i don't have to sync my solution with autoplay
 eulerscheZahl: westicles shares that opinion about autoplayan option sounds fineor disable if the user writes multiple commands at once (or only apply after last action of a given list)
 JBM: off makes total sense for computer solvers
 JBM: the MS alg isn't even optimal
 JBM: I intended to have both MS and optimal
 JBM: but having an 3rd "NONE" option is peanuts
 Frosty2416: Dagavin you need to transform it
 JBM: adding to list
 Frosty2416: Input will be like "CC"
 Dagavin: ok thank you :D
 eulerscheZahl: when playing freecell on windows many years ago, i noticed that moving between piles isn't always right
 eulerscheZahl: you have a max size of how many cards you can move at once
 eulerscheZahl: based on free cascades and single cells
 eulerscheZahl: and the MS formula is more conservative than it has to be
 JBM: yup, that's the whole point
 JBM: it's got special cases for A and 2
 JBM: and isn't optimal
 JBM: then again, for computer solving, disabling is just as fine
 ParticleBeam: Huh. Fixing a major bug gains 600 ranks

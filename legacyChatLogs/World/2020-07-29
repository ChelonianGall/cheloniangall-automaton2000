 AbundantPuddle: Welcome ptran!
 Rynoz: hi ptran&#160;:&gt;
 auddog: hi!
 NivethSaran: I accidentally deleted the Puzzle of the Week notification
 NivethSaran: how can I access the Puzzle of the week?
 AbundantPuddle: It's the sudoku puzzle.
 AbundantPuddle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/sudoku-validator">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/sudoku-validator</a>
 NivethSaran: Thank you
 AbundantPuddle: No problem.
 StepBack13: is the network glitching?
 JayBeAl: why cant i see my tutorial progress at the home page?
 tomatoes: what tutorial?
 JayBeAl: sometimes there is shown like an xp tree, challenges like do 3 loop puzzles and get xp for it
 tomatoes: probably its not home page. some other section/page<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/home">https://www.codingame.com/home</a>
 JayBeAl: ye but i cant find it. The link u sent is just the homepage. Im only getting viewed my level, overall rank, achievements, my last 3 activities, one puzzle recommendation and the CD for the next Clash of Code.
 JayBeAl: Sometimes the xp tree is also shown, but i cant figure out when and how to trigger 
 tomatoes: sounds like old home page :thinking:
 tomatoes: try hard page refresh
 JayBeAl: when did they update?
 tomatoes: 1 week ago maybe
 JayBeAl: im only member for 3-4 days now
 JayBeAl: hard refresh didn´t fix it
 tomatoes: strange
 JayBeAl: okay deleting cookies did it. But why? I saw it before in this browser, deleted cookies 2 days ago and i still did not see it
 JayBeAl: Its kinda random
 tomatoes: tbh no idea
 JayBeAl: Thanks anyways, maybe i can reproduce it. I will write a bug report in this case then.
 jacek: good morning
 jacek: darn i read about particle swarm optimization. i think i have new kink
 LoGos: JayBeAl someone said that some new users may not see quest page due to AB testing
 JayBeAl: @LoGos thanks for the Info. I just wonder why i see it sometimes and a day or so after it disappeared again
 G-Rom: yes, there is an AB test
 G-Rom: so new users have 50% chance to get it
 JayBeAl: and that chnages everytime i approach the site with no cookies? That would explain the behaviour
 JayBeAl: changes*
 G-Rom: yes, the variant you get is stored on your local storage. So if you move to another browser or clear the cookies, the variant is generated again
 JayBeAl: alright, case solved then, thanks
 JayBeAl: i definitely prefer the one with the quest page, since im an achievement hunter :D
 G-Rom: sure&#160;;)
 jacek: a gratification generation
 DomiKo: good morning
 aCat: hi hi
 Shivishbrahma: hola amigos
 itzblinkzy: whats poppin peeps
 itzblinkzy: usama_022 are you able to share your code?
 itzblinkzy: :pensivE:
 itzblinkzy: i guess not..
 JayBeAl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/465b9ca2-710c-43da-97d2-947fd7392dc3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/465b9ca2-710c-43da-97d2-947fd7392dc3</a>
 Nixerrr: JayBeAl What have you changed? Could you share your code?
 JayBeAl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a711adc6-c3dc-4730-b222-f56d3e43ba97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a711adc6-c3dc-4730-b222-f56d3e43ba97</a>
 JayBeAl: there you go
 Nixerrr: There is no spoon ep 1?
 JayBeAl: yes
 Nixerrr: I don't know any C#, but I can't see you read the "string line" from the Console
 Nixerrr: This is missing "            string line = Console.ReadLine();" 
 JayBeAl: damn there is missing a code line, i pasted the wrong code sorry, was testing. 1 mom
 JayBeAl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eac0b98b-5b51-4806-a6e1-9b417c79655e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eac0b98b-5b51-4806-a6e1-9b417c79655e</a>
 JayBeAl: this one is the right one
 JayBeAl: sorry for this
 Nixerrr: Odd. I don't understand why you're getting that error. Seems to me you're reading the input before printing an instruction.
 Nixerrr: Maybe someone familiar with C# can chime in
 Astrobytes: I'd remove this semicolon for starters:if(cellData&#160;!=  string.Empty);
 Astrobytes: Hi Nixerrr :wave:
 Nixerrr: Hey hey, that's a good catch&#160;:)
 JayBeAl: The thing is, that my algo is working anyways. But warnings like this trigger me :D
 JayBeAl: oh lol chat didnt scroll down
 Nixerrr: Okie dokes!
 JayBeAl: Oh lol such a typo :D Thanks Astro :DBut the C# compiler is ignoring semicolons after ifs i think. Otherwise even the first test case wouldn´t work, but it did^^
 JayBeAl: Lol ok never mind. This semicolons is not ignored
 JayBeAl: -s
 Nixerrr: Was that the issue then?
 Astrobytes: Just because code passes one test does not prove your semi-colon doesn't affect it&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: It's not the only issue no
 JayBeAl: and the warning is gone, yes
 JayBeAl: astro the algo is not done yet, i just wanted to get rid of the warning, and removing the semicolon did&#160;:)
 JayBeAl: Thanks&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Ah ok, cool&#160;:)
 JayBeAl: Im used to VS Studio where such typos are directly highlighted red and prevents the code from running x)
 Astrobytes: Oh it was highlighted for me, just not in red, the text changes colour
 Nixerrr: JayBeAl You can use VS Studio. Get CG Sync
 JayBeAl: you are kiddin :O
 Nixerrr: I am not
 JayBeAl: is it a nuget?
 Nixerrr: Are you using Chrome? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-app/nmdombhgnofjnnaenegcdehnbkajfgbh">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-app/nmdombhgnofjnnaenegcdehnbkajfgbh</a>
 JayBeAl: firefox, but i would switch for this O:
 JayBeAl: Can i also use this for VS Code?
 Astrobytes: Does this not happen for you in CG IDE JayBeAl?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/h112Tpw">https://imgur.com/a/h112Tpw</a>
 Nixerrr: It's independent of the IDE, since the local file gets uploaded
 JayBeAl: it does, it just was so little i didnt see it x)
 Nixerrr: synchronized
 JayBeAl: oh nice, thanks a lot nixer! i think this will make it much more comfortable&#160;:)
 RoboStac: there an alternative called  cg local  that is meant to work with firefox. 
 Astrobytes: You know you can zoom in &amp; out with the mouse wheel + Ctrl?
 RoboStac: never tried it though
 JayBeAl: thanks robo
 JayBeAl: and yes astro i do, but i hate this kind of zoom, thats why i dont use it xD its just making the font bigger
 Astrobytes: For the whole browser window?
 Astrobytes: If so, make sure the editor has focus and it'll only zoom that
 JayBeAl: no just the editor, but i am used to the standardsize. I never expected a warning this small. Ill know in the future&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Ah ok&#160;:)
 JayBeAl: Thanks for all the input guys, thats amazing here&#160;:)
 Nixerrr: No probs :thumbsup:
 Astrobytes: You're welcome!
 DomiKo: guys are there any blogs about "how to improve GA"?
 Astrobytes: Probably, I don't know any off the top of my head. What's the issue? 
 DomiKo: the issue is 
 DomiKo: that i don't know what to do
 DomiKo: i read like everyting on CG
 MSmits: why do you need GA DomiKo?
 DomiKo: MarLander
 MSmits: ahh ok
 DomiKo: MarsLander
 MSmits: to solve it or to optimize it?
 DomiKo: #25 now
 Scarfield: have you implemented "elites"
 Astrobytes: To write it in the first place? There's a python tutorial on tech.io, did you try that?
 DomiKo: optimize
 Scarfield: oh i guess you have xD
 MSmits: ah right, optimize then, cant help you, good job on 25
 Astrobytes: Ah
 DomiKo: i read like a lot
 DomiKo: and i guess 
 DomiKo: i know some stuff
 Astrobytes: Fine tune your fitness function I guess
 DomiKo: but now i reached point
 DomiKo: where only thing i can do
 DomiKo: is like change 0.05 to 0.06
 DomiKo: test for like hour
 Scarfield: do you randomize the initial population?
 DomiKo: and see wow 1 point more
 MSmits: how different is your score vs the rest DomiKo?
 DomiKo: huge gap
 MSmits: hm ok
 Astrobytes: maybe don't crossover so much as time increases? So you don't wreck your solution
 DomiKo: 2453 me
 DomiKo: 2509 best
 MSmits: are marslander validators public?
 DomiKo: i found that on 4 test i have like -12 points
 MSmits: i mean did they leak?
 DomiKo: they are the "same"
 DomiKo: map is moved in some direction
 MSmits: DomiKo are you solving it online or offline?
 DomiKo: current offline
 MSmits: ah ok
 DomiKo: when online -10 points
 DomiKo: -20 maybe
 MSmits: how big is the gap with the rest?
 DomiKo: 50 points
 MSmits: well first thing you should do is hardcode the solution you found offline
 MSmits: that should get you up some ranks right? or is it 50 pts to the next?
 DomiKo: but should i improve it like manually?
 DomiKo: is it a thing?
 DomiKo: no no
 DomiKo: 50 points to top
 MSmits: offline solving is a thing yes
 DomiKo: gap to top10 is 32 points
 MSmits: originally this was not intended to happen, but people figure out to validators in various ways
 DomiKo: that a lot
 DomiKo: i mean yea i know 
 DomiKo: i solve it offline now
 MSmits: numbershifting (by Euler) is actually intended to be solved only offline
 DomiKo: and only ctrl c ctrl v
 MSmits: so its no big deal
 MSmits: doing it manually might be good
 DomiKo: hmmm
 MSmits: i solved some validators on zombies manually
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: zombies are like silimiar to test?
 DomiKo: or the same?
 MSmits: different
 MSmits: but similar i guess
 DomiKo: hmmm
 MSmits: lets take this to pm btw
 DomiKo: kk
 Astrobytes: Have you tried jumping randomly? Like in SA, so you don't get stuck in local optima?
 DomiKo: jumping randomly?
 DomiKo: i dont know SA&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: It's simple, I gotta run right now, but google it
 Astrobytes: cya all later, got an appointment
 Scarfield: cya
 Nixerrr: Later!
 Scarfield: alli
 DomiKo: later
 DomiKo: thanks
 Scarfield: hi Nixerrr
 Nixerrr: Hey hey
 MSmits: DomiKo SA is simpler than GA
 MSmits: basically it's hillclimbing with a random margin that shrinks as time passes
 MSmits: you switch to a worse solution sometimes based on that random number
 MSmits: that way you get out of a local optimum
 DomiKo: ohh okey
 DomiKo: now i understand
 MSmits: way less parameters than GA
 MSmits: and it often works just as well as  or better than GA, even though it often is worse as well
 MSmits: depends on the problem I guesss
 Scarfield: how do you create your initial population, i suppose if you are creating them randomly, it can be improved by some simple parameters
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: full random
 MSmits: oh btw, SA = simulated annealing: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing</a>
 MSmits: contests have been won with it
 DomiKo: yea i seen
 MSmits: k
 DomiKo: that was next thing on my bucket list to learn
 MSmits: is on mine as well, i know the theory fairly well, but  never got around t oit
 MSmits: i was following a course on AI for my studies and was hoping they'd get to this but they didnt
 Thyl: Hello&#160;!
 Nixerrr: Was it an online course, MSmits?
 MSmits: instead i got a crossword puzzle creator that could be bruteforced instead of optimized&#160;:(
 MSmits: yes the harvard one
 MSmits: CS 50 AI
 MSmits: pretty basic 
 MSmits: got highest grade on everything easily
 MSmits: it's free, you can go do it 
 Nixerrr: It's more of an intro course I guess
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it's kind of like a 1st year uni thing
 Nixerrr: I've done some of the CS50 courses. Great stuff. In fact, I started coding by doing their Intro to CS course.
 MSmits: ahh nice
 MSmits: well the lectures and assignments are good
 MSmits: the AI one goes into Q-learning and NN's as well btw
 DomiKo: I had intro to AI last semester, and now i trying to code everything
 MSmits: but my teacher for this never went that far, the course didnt have enough credits to do the full harvard thing
 MSmits: so i did most of the extra stuff on my own
 Nixerrr: Intro to CS was the single best online course I've done. The rest of their courses were mediocre. Good to know the AI one is good too.
 MSmits: yeah, you get annoyed by the lecturer if you watch them too quickly in a row. But that's unavoidable
 MSmits: any lecturer's quirks get annoying if you see too much
 MSmits: you'll get annoyed now quicker, because I said this :P
 Nixerrr: I'm not easily annoyed :P
 MSmits: ah then you'll be fine
 DomiKo: lucky man
 MSmits: I need to do code of the rings to continue my quests
 MSmits: i have a solution but need to shrink it with brainfk stuff
 Nixerrr: I either need to approve/reject a contribution or do 3 very hard puzzles :thinking:
 MSmits: do very hard puzzles, is more fun&#160;:)
 Nixerrr: I haven't done all the hard ones - gonna do that first
 DomiKo: i believe that i have some old greedy in code of the rings
 MSmits: some very hard puzzles are not very hard though
 MSmits: i do too DomiKo, just need to shrink it
 DomiKo: next one in don't panik in less than 200
 DomiKo: and i can't get that&#160;:(
 MSmits: just don't panic
 DomiKo: hehe
 MSmits: i dont see it in optim
 MSmits: oh code golf
 DomiKo: code golf :P
 MSmits: ah my current solution is just copied from the puzzle
 MSmits: 3848 chars :P
 DomiKo: cool
 MSmits: even have commentary
 DomiKo: that's close i guess
 MSmits: mmh cant you make this small with python?
 MSmits: 200 seems doable?
 DomiKo: ...
 DomiKo: 240+
 MSmits: now i wanna try it
 DomiKo: i read data in 160 
 Scarfield: import DontPanic as DP
 DomiKo: DP.solve()
 MSmits: well you need a faster way to read data then
 MSmits: at least you know what to focus on
 DomiKo: i guess my solution if not the worst
 DomiKo: is*
 DomiKo: but i don't know
 DomiKo: reading line 
 MSmits: there's people with 64
 DomiKo: yea....
 MSmits: so you're reading input wrong
 DomiKo: and  59 in C
 Nixerrr: Magic
 DomiKo: dbb r
 DomiKo: magic
 MSmits: yeah dbd r went crazy on code golf :P
 DomiKo: ohh man
 DomiKo: 221
 MSmits: trying to convert my C# solution to something that works in python
 MSmits: so that i can then shrink it
 psychopath: Hi
 psychopath: I'd like to dvp a programm to show the difference between class and instance
 psychopath: any idea??
 MSmits: sorry, i don't know what exactly you're saying
 MSmits: any program that uses classes and instances (objects&#160;?) should have this visible in the source code
 Scarfield: Deutsche VolksPartei / Delivery Vs Payment
 psychopath: @MSmits I know it's for an exercice and the statement is quite ambiguous
 psychopath: But it s actually stated as I mentionned
 MSmits: ok, well I don't know then&#160;:(
 psychopath: write a program to show the difference between a class and an instance.. And it also seems weird to me...
 Scarfield: class IAmClass{
 tomatoes: aren't they obviously different things?
 JBM: oh my #fr leaked here again
 MSmits: plug it JBM
 JBM: well some already started
 JBM: have fun!
 psychopath: Exactly it seems obvious to me
 psychopath: But dunna what is really expected
 psychopath: Perhaps just creating a class and an instance with different attributes and methods..
 Scarfield: The idea of the assignment is probably just to show that you understand what the different terms mean
 psychopath: Hope so...!
 psychopath: ty!
 tomatoes: memory_used() and two loops maybe
 tomatoes: to show that instance is an instance :rolling_eyes:
 DomiKo: 207 chars...
 DomiKo: so close and so far at the same time...
 psychopath: @tomatoes nice idea, ill try that way
 hmsayem: :neutral_face:
 DomiKo: omggggg
 DomiKo: 200 charss
 DomiKo: iam done
 DomiKo: i hate code golf
 DomiKo: and yes
 DomiKo: i panic
 MSmits: gj&#160;:)
 DomiKo: reach 2% in gold gold leader....
 DomiKo: code golf*
 DomiKo: i can even spell that
 DomiKo: can't
 remi6: Hello! Here is a bot that collects Clash of Code links from Twitch: #Clash
 jacek: good for you
 AntiSquid: it's good there's a clash channel and that it doesn't spam main chat :p
 MSmits: yeah this is nice
 MSmits: I mean I won't use it, but still nice for those who will
 AntiSquid: did you do your clash path MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: not fully yet
 MSmits: but made some progress
 AntiSquid: see? that chat is useful for you 
 MSmits: why, i can just start clashes :P
 jacek: people following the clash path...
 AntiSquid: OCD
 MSmits: currently trying to shrink down my code for dont panic
 AntiSquid: well not really, but hate to see it incomplete :D
 ckstmznf: Hello World
 MSmits: gj
 Xcalibre: i managed 200 chars in don't panic using c++
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: dont know which language is easiest here
 Xcalibre: definitely NOT c++
 MSmits: but should be easily possible for python, given the leaderboard
 Xcalibre: yeah
 AntiSquid: javascript
 MSmits: why js?
 jacek: RIP struct
 ben007: rust
 AntiSquid: you doing golf MSmits?
 MSmits: it's on the quest path apparently
 MSmits: i also still need to shrink code of the rings
 MSmits: dont panic comes after
 AntiSquid: occasionally it's possible to translate short solutions tricks from one language to the other, but after a while you end up googling for language specifics  "golf tricks for x language"
 RoboStac: if you just want a decent golf score there are usually semi golfed solutions on the basic puzzle 
 RoboStac: which can be good for some tips 
 MSmits: nice one Robo
 MSmits: I am guessing this is mostly the algorithmic part that is golfed in basic puzzles
 MSmits: and you can always make the variable names shorter for those
 AntiSquid: where is struct btw? jacek what did you do to him?
 Nixerrr: :scream_cat:
 Washier: so clicked on all the quest stuff today and my level went up, even though i did all those things. ok
 MSmits: what do you mean?
 Washier: went one level up without doing anything
 MSmits: yeah, thats because the quest xp is applied retroactively
 Washier: except clicking on the quest page. i dont mind.
 MSmits: otherwise it wouldnt be fair
 Washier: oh ok
 Washier: ty
 MSmits: argh 209 chars for dont panic, just 9 to shave off&#160;:)
 Washier: in lang?
 MSmits: python
 MSmits: i think i need to do something with input.split
 Washier: cool. is it known shortest for the problem?
 MSmits: i dont really care, probably not, but its doable below 100 apparently
 MSmits: i only need 200 for the quest
 Washier: ah.
 MSmits: my basic puzzle solytion used almost 4k chars :P
 MSmits: did that in C#
 Washier: haha.
 MSmits: so i am quite impressed with myself for getting it down to 209 so far&#160;:)
 Washier: yes. C# can be shorter though, but not short. ask me, i've persisted with it in gold.
 MSmits: gold?
 Washier: *golf
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: well it doesnt matter if you use a wordy language in code golf on CG
 MSmits: cp is calculated per language
 MSmits: so if you're best in C# you get max points
 Washier: true. thinking about clash
 MSmits: yeah thats different
 MSmits: dont use C# in clash :P
 AntiSquid: oh i forgot that, perhaps i should do D
 AntiSquid: since everyone hates it
 Washier: i am like that. sometimes i beat python. never ruby. 
 MSmits: it only needs 1 person who is really good with D to screw up that plan AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: so then i get #2
 MSmits: yeah but is cp based on rank or on ratio to best score?
 MSmits: for code golf
 AntiSquid: no idea anymore 
 MSmits: i thought it was based on best score
 Washier: i know you guys are leet, so its different. i'm trying real hard(for myself) to go top 500, and clash, if you work hard at it, is an easy 4700+ points. so every know and again i warm up my fingers and hope for fastest or reverse and go for &lt;1min. bam! 4700+ points
 AntiSquid: that's just your perception, there is no leet here
 Washier: ty, but not so sure. really hard to go top 500.
 Washier: but yes, i love this community. no one is leet really. 
 AntiSquid: because those people probably spent months searching for language gimmicks
 MSmits: Washier I suck at clash
 Washier: true, but thinking about all the rest. bots, optimization, etc. some really really clever people here. suppose most importantly, i'm having a lot of fun
 Washier: MSmits, i have no doubt you could master it with practice.
 Astrobytes: that's the main thing, fun&#160;;)
 Washier:&#160;;)
 MSmits: meh, need motivation for that Washier 
 MSmits: I like doing bots
 DomiKo: geting exp is so fun
 Washier: me too.
 Washier: hi DomiKo.
 DomiKo: hi&#160;:)
 Nixerrr: Just noticed you're a moderation too now, Astrobytes :O
 Washier: trying hard to best your othello bot
 Washier: 'stro FTW
 Astrobytes: ah yeah Nixerrr, loads of us now
 MSmits: cool, I am still fitting params, but getting only small improvements now
 Astrobytes: lol, 'stro
 Nixerrr: Sweet
 MSmits: ohh you can separate stuff with&#160;; in python!
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: rly?
 MSmits: can put a ton of crap after a for loop statement 
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Hmmmm didn't know that...
 DomiKo: ohh yes
 MSmits: for a in range(x): do this;do that
 Washier: same in any C lang. even in C#&#160;; is a valid statement
 DomiKo: with that i done 209 -&gt; 198
 MSmits: nice, gonna make it then!
 DomiKo: i used if else trick
 MSmits: did you do sign swapping to avoid "LEFT" and "RIGHT"&#160;?
 DomiKo: with initialization
 DomiKo: nope
 MSmits: ah ok
 DomiKo: just compare to L
 Washier: if-else trick?
 MSmits: what is L?
 DomiKo: "L"
 Washier: oh, short-circuit logic
 MSmits: oh ok
 DomiKo: Washier yes
 DomiKo: one&#160;: less
 DomiKo: but there is no way for me
 Washier: :thumbsup:
 DomiKo: and top2%
 DomiKo: in code golf
 Astrobytes: I managed to get top 0.4% after my golfing Sunday. Never again.
 DomiKo: ohh wow
 Washier: i think if rank matters to you(to me, personal quest), you need to do it 0 clash points. like the pro's
 DomiKo: clashing is fun for me&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I still can't bring myself to do the clash path on the quest map
 Astrobytes: maybe one day
 MSmits: you can do it in less than a day prolly
 Astrobytes: I consider that a waste :P
 DomiKo: as a CompetetivProgrammer I see clashing as making super easy tasks ;P
 Washier: i agree.
 MSmits: kinda is&#160;:)
 DomiKo: so i have to take that 4.8K points
 Astrobytes: :D
 Washier: and you can MSmits.
 Washier: DomiKo, you can get a ~2k points if you ace checkers, bandas and the other one.
 DomiKo: right know 
 DomiKo: making like 2K per day
 DomiKo: i guess
 DomiKo: maybe 1K
 DomiKo: 38/5000I really want to be a Guru this vacation
 Washier: jeepers. 
 Washier: good on you. you can do eeet
 DomiKo: right now i found optimalization really fun
 tomatoes: do top 10 in 10 multis
 tomatoes: ez
 Washier: ez. haha
 DomiKo: yea top 10...
 Washier: impressive tomatoes. 
 DomiKo: right know the best one is i guess UTTT? ~50 place
 tomatoes: i'm not yet :disappointed:
 DomiKo: so to top10 there is a loooonggg way
 Washier: you can dooo eet. im very sure
 Nixerrr: No sleep till guru
 Washier: CG is hard.
 AntiSquid: no sleep till skynet
 Astrobytes: Guru or delete account
 Washier: haha
 Washier: i like that 'stro. to the end
 Washier: do you guys also dream about CG&gt;
 Washier:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: struct did it for a contest. Legend or delete. He deleted.
 Washier: respect
 Nixerrr: Seriously?
 Scarfield: yes
 DomiKo: ohh no&#160;:(
 Nixerrr: Wow. Was it the last contest?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, UTG? (Crystal Rush) was it?
 Astrobytes: I think
 Nixerrr: I thought I've seen him since then
 Astrobytes: Oh he came back
 Nixerrr: Ah ok
 Washier: he's pervasive
 AntiSquid: i am close to legend in that one, too lazy to implement one last thing to make the jump
 Scarfield: new account, his Yinsch now has a unknown account - or something similar
 AntiSquid: struct could do it too, or was there a deadline?
 Nixerrr: He had another account, N something
 Astrobytes: Nulte
 Nixerrr: Right
 Scarfield: Nick?
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: why make such weird bets anyway?
 Nixerrr: Sounds fun to me
 AntiSquid: then why not get legend instead?
 Astrobytes: struct is ... unconventional
 Nixerrr: Once I bet Zarthax on who gets legend first
 Nixerrr: He still owes me 1 million $
 Scarfield: xD
 Washier: haha
 AntiSquid: i am sure he'll pay you one day 
 AntiSquid: when you work for his multimillion dollar company
 Nixerrr: I hope so, got a massive mortgage because of that!
 Washier: haha
 Washier: interest rates dropping where i am.
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: top100 have 68'777 points
 Washier: sorry, have to add, so is the # cases. easily 10k per day
 andersgee: test
 Astrobytes: FAILED
 andersgee: okay, hello folks. Anyone know if I can instantiate webassembly modules when writing javascript here on codingame?
 Astrobytes: I have no idea, sorry!
 Astrobytes: I would guess not, but I'm not 100%
 AntiSquid: why do you need them on CG?
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes  05:27PMstruct is ... unconventional
 Astrobytes: Undetectable.
 eulerscheZahl: i golfed the replay myself now&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: SILENCE
 AntiSquid: i mean he used the silence skills
 AntiSquid: skill
 eulerscheZahl: from 650kb to 83not quite strcut level compression but goodenough
 Astrobytes: nice
 AntiSquid: struct gave up in low gold, i am sure he is better than that

 theBatman: Hii im batman
 jacek: you mean bruce?
 Astrobytes: jacek, you have a bot in Atari Go, it needs one more approval - anything wrong with it or can you approve it?
 jacek: my bot only passes ~
 Astrobytes: hmm
 jacek: why would i approve something if i dont have proper bot for that?
 jacek: ~
 Astrobytes: I didn't know it was a pass bot
 Astrobytes: all good
 jacek: it would have hard time at othello :v
 MSmits: argh 203 chars in dont panic
 MSmits: 3 more!!
 eulerscheZahl: 3 less!
 MSmits: right
 eulerscheZahl: left
 MSmits: thats what i was doing wrong
 MSmits: :grin:
 DomiKo: you can do it!
 eulerscheZahl: python?
 MSmits: yeah
 Xcalibre: 197 in c++ here
 eulerscheZahl: 200 in py&#160;:)
 DomiKo: 198 in python and i'am proud 
 MSmits: i think i need to do something with the input().split()
 DomiKo: you use input() two times?
 eulerscheZahl: 3
 MSmits: u=input then 3 times u()
 DomiKo: kk
 MSmits: but dunno how to reduce the split
 DomiKo: idk too
 DomiKo: i reduced some with printing output
 Allis: You can do multiple variable assignment in an exec(); maybe useful?
 MSmits: but i have global variables, dont i need to pass them into the exec?&gt;
 AntiSquid: JS solution doesn't work in TS ugh, glad TS is so amazing
 Astrobytes: trictrac: thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: where is he pushing you?
 Astrobytes: Nowhere. He validated Atari Go
 MSmits: oh cool
 trictrac: but it seems that a bug is remaining 
 trictrac: internal error when submitting 
 aCat: try resubmit .zip again
 aCat: I mean rebuild and resubmit
 Astrobytes: This didn't happen in the test version, what's the error?
 Astrobytes: Someone else's multi aCat
 aCat: I know
 aCat: but if I got the issue then the solution may be the same
 aCat: My own go version I started half a year ago I never ended... but I got cool graphics&#160;:(
 aCat: but this was full go
 Astrobytes: It worked OK for me trictrac - was it a compilation error?
 trictrac: I resubmit and it's ok
 aCat: see
 aCat: listen to this cat ^^'
 Astrobytes: Yes, I think that error is actualyl on CG's side
 Astrobytes: aCat - no he just resubmitted his bot
 aCat: And about pushing... just make approve on mine :D
 aCat: bleh
 aCat: ok, this cat happens to be wrong also
 Astrobytes: The compilation error is a CG-side error, if it's happening frequently we might need to report it
 MSmits: anyone want to look at my dont panic code golf and note something obvious i am missing for those last 3 chars? I'll pm
 AntiSquid: ok
 AntiSquid: i can try
 MSmits: domiko helped me to 199:0
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks though AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: lol ok
 MSmits: keywords not needing space and 2 places where i could string more lines together with 
 MSmits: ";"
 AgentBlackout: pog
 tomatoes: what does ":0" after 199 mean?
 AntiSquid: decimal characters
 AntiSquid: no idea :D
 AntiSquid: now i am really curious about shortening code in TypeShit
 tomatoes: it seems it was smile attempt :frowning:
 tomatoes: i thought some golf metrics
 jacek: trictrac fix your draws <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/478954714">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/478954714</a>
 trictrac: thanks I will have a look. For the instant a draw is almost a lose so bad behavior

 AntiSquid: PrinceSanjivy no clash invite links please
 AntiSquid: not in main chat at least
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid you banned a user 1 or 2 weeks ago. Why am I getting private messages about it?&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: the user was whay and the ban was deserved IMO
 Astrobytes: Oh that one again
 eulerscheZahl: created a new account, i can home to this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/tqp6xp">https://prnt.sc/tqp6xp</a>
 inoryy: eulerscheZahl hi
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday he told me "i am band"so i asked him about his career as a musician
 eulerscheZahl: hi input.txt
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy
 Astrobytes: lol * 2
 eulerscheZahl: so many more tab completion options now&#160;:/
 DomiKo: lol²
 Astrobytes: Ah yes I saw him in the chat last night, didn't know it was whay but should've guessed
 AntiSquid: its not a global ban, so he can bullox us everyday
 eulerscheZahl: and he can create new accounts
 jacek: like struct?
 AntiSquid: ban + ignore his PM + ignore his existence, best thing to do, don't even mention the low quality troll
 jacek: i thought only struct could do that
 inoryy: why would you ignore his post mortem
 Astrobytes: speaking of low quality trolls.. :P
 Astrobytes: @jacek
 jacek: low quality?&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: a while ago Magus was facing a severe troll. He incremented a counter in the username each time he got banned and had to start again
 Astrobytes: Yeah, fix it
 AntiSquid: astro being mean&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: saw him at 38
 inoryy: wow
 Astrobytes: jeez
 inoryy: now that's dedication
 eulerscheZahl: Magus said he doesn't care, he can ban faster than others can create new accounts
 AntiSquid: wow
 AntiSquid: ban faster than his shadow, like Lucky Luke
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 did i kill chat with a shitty joke?
 Automaton2000: and you can do it better
 AntiSquid: thanks for the confidence
 MSmits: Automaton2000 makes better jokes :P
 Automaton2000: but i beat the boss
 MSmits: you're the boss Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but when i do a bunch of other things to do
 Astrobytes: who on earth is Lucky Luke?
 eulerscheZahl: are you kidding?
 Astrobytes: No
 eulerscheZahl: a cartoon cowboy
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luke">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luke</a>
 Astrobytes: Looks vaguely familiar
 eulerscheZahl: so, do you know Asterix and Obelix?How about Tintin and Melou?
 eulerscheZahl: the smurfs
 Astrobytes: Of course I know those
 eulerscheZahl: the flintstones
 Astrobytes: ofc
 eulerscheZahl: but not lucky luke? :o
 DomiKo: :O
 Astrobytes: Do you know Oor Wullie or The Broons?
 eulerscheZahl: falls into the same category of popularity I think
 eulerscheZahl: no and no :P
 Astrobytes: Scottish cartoons (comic strips only).
 eulerscheZahl: 500k hits on google
 eulerscheZahl: vs 75 million for lucky luke
 eulerscheZahl: 16M for the smurfs
 Astrobytes: Pfff
 eulerscheZahl: Lucky Luke is the one arresting the Daltons
 eulerscheZahl: 4 brothers with different heights. and the smallest is the smartest
 Astrobytes: Man, that could be anything
 Astrobytes: I probably know it and just don't remember, or didn't like it
 eulerscheZahl: even had a few movies with approx 90min duration
 Astrobytes: The only cowboy stuff I watched as a kid was actual Westerns
 AntiSquid: did you watch "Men in Black International"&#160;?
 AntiSquid: basically MIB 4
 Astrobytes: Nope
 eulerscheZahl: nope++
 DomiKo: ++nope
 DomiKo: but do you know "Gummi Bears"?
 Astrobytes: yep
 eulerscheZahl: with toady&#160;:)
 MSmits: I know about the Giant Gummy Lizard
 DomiKo: I know whole intro music from "Gummi Bears" :joy:
 Astrobytes: Bouncing here and there and everywhere
 MSmits: you need to format your brain :P
 MSmits: wipe that
 Astrobytes: remember the Raccoons?
 MSmits: maybe i do, depends what they're called in Dutch
 DomiKo: i never seen them&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: The raccoons used to like run a newspaper in a forest
 MSmits: vaguely remember
 eulerscheZahl: i remember some beaver brothers
 Astrobytes: always fighting against the aardvark Cyril Sneer
 Astrobytes: Chip 'n' Dale Rescue Rangers?
 MSmits: mmh I thought the stuff my daughter watches now is way stranger than what we had on TV, but I am revising my opinion , listening to Astrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: s[0]&gt;"L" is inefficients&gt;"M" is way shorter \o/
 Astrobytes: NAh, kids have it well good for cartoons these days
 MSmits: do you know bubble guppys?
 Astrobytes: Just googled, never seen that one
 MSmits: it's like a cartoon where everything out of normal life is underwater, a dog has a fishtail and all that
 MSmits: so they're always underwater
 MSmits: but they go to the beach
 Astrobytes: lol, pretty surreal
 MSmits: they're already under water, and there is a beach there, and more water (?)
 eulerscheZahl: like spongebob
 Astrobytes: Sopngebob++
 MSmits: blows my mind
 Astrobytes: Or Spongebob++
 Astrobytes: What happens if they go diving?
 eulerscheZahl: apparently they can drown <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MORLQeV-XmU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MORLQeV-XmU</a>

 MSmits: good night eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: gn
 jacek: what a promotion in othello
 Rayan23: hii#
 rememberThis: ello gents
 MadelineDonlan: ayo
 Zrelolerz: a
 Dlx: wt_, what is the point of doing shortest code wiht java vs some other scripted language???
 jb_firefoxx: Java is auto-lose if you ask me
 jb_firefoxx: are there bots here?
 Allis: @Dlx Pretty much any time you see Java being used for golf, that user is actually a CodinGame bot. There are half-a-dozen or so and you'll start to spot them pretty easily.
 Allis: Of course, some people are here just to sharpen their skills and don't really bother to golf.
 praveeno: hi
 Dlx: clash of code, sometimes you just want something quick...

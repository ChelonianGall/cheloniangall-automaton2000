 UZUHAMA: Dang
 UZUHAMA: I really wanted to finish Clash of Code
 UZUHAMA: Are there absolutely no way to finish it?
 UZUHAMA: After time is over?
 Urutar: Nope. After the time has run out, it's over - and you can only submit either your latest code or your last tested version if time is running out.

 aangairbender: I hope CG can add o3 compilation flag before spring challenge. At least as checkbox, which is disabled by default.
 aangairbender: I just want to write usual c++ which is fast, but I need to suffer instead (not using std, add pragmas etc)
 aangairbender: CG is for getting a job mainly (or interviewing), but I am afraid of showing my code to any interviewer because of this issue
 Thorcode: can someone give me a hint about power of thor 2

 Uljahn: Oo
 Thorcode: bc I have a distance code
 Thorcode: nah nevermind I will figure it on my own

 Superwog1: Stop sexually harrassing me
 Uljahn: just leave
 Superwog1: How much do u get paid
 Urutar: Yeah, right. The only thing 9 here is your level of trolling, maybe.
 Goulamander: Clash of code is difficult
 Urutar: Not always, but sometimes.
 Superwog1: how old r u Urutar
 renju7: how does for loop in python work
 Goulamander: Phyton&#160;:  loop ();
 Superwog1: for is a keyword that can iterate any data type
 Goulamander: trus me I'm not noob
 Superwog1: (apart from complex or integer)
 Urutar: Old enough to a) know not to answer that and b) recognize a troll when I see one (or atleast to assume so)
 Goulamander: Urutar is german
 Goulamander: Guten tag mein Freun
 Urutar: Oh yes, I am german years old XD
 Superwog1: Very funny
 Urutar: I think so, too
 Superwog1: How old are you though
 Superwog1: 13?
 Superwog1: 12?
 Urutar: See previous answer to that question.
 DialFrost: lol
 Goulamander: Ich wollte spielen stattdessen habe so etwas clash of code was für n müll ist
 Urutar: also, 18&lt;MY_AGE&lt;99
 DialFrost: oooooooooooh
 Superwog1: ok
 DialFrost: so urutar is old basically
 Goulamander: Wo finde ich den Shooter?
 DialFrost: XD
 Urutar: Yes, old enough to... (see earlier answer XD)
 Urutar: Which shooter?
 5DN1L: Not a place to discuss age here
 Goulamander: For killing aliens
 DialFrost: bruh im stuck at bronze league
 Superwog1: Urutar, are you an intern?
 Goulamander: something like this
 Goulamander: I'm in the wrong platform?
 Goulamander: ok
 Urutar: Nah, not an intern or affiliated with CG at all
 Goulamander: i like games
 Urutar: Code vs zombies might be up your sleeve
 Goulamander: ok
 Goulamander: Where do I find this?
 Urutar: Search in the top search bar for it
 Urutar: Can't miss it
 Goulamander: Thanks XD I found it
 Urutar: Otherwise to be found under Multiplayer -&gt; Compete -&gt; Optimization
 Goulamander: What is the trailing /n
 Goulamander: I think i will switch to codemonkey
 Thorcode: nice Urutar
 Goulamander: Thats to  complex
 Goulamander: *too complex
 Thorcode: nah
 Goulamander: Of cource
 Urutar: What's nice, exactly?
 Goulamander: course
 Thorcode: code vs zom is not that hard
 Goulamander: maybe I don't have the fundamentals yet
 Urutar: Skipping past bad jokes, it's not that hard to complete it by saving only 1 human for a start
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: just go around a human
 Urutar: Maybe start with some easy puzzles&#160;:)
 Thorcode: or start with power of thor 2
 Goulamander: i know what echo () is and some Kontrollstrukturen
 Urutar: What languages are you somewhat proficient in?
 Urutar: Which*
 Goulamander: I need to learn some PHP
 Thorcode: I guess it is php
 Thorcode: or ruby
 Goulamander: echo () is php think I thoug
 Goulamander: I though
 Goulamander: usually you would use print ()
 Urutar: ruby is puts I think
 Thorcode: yeah
 Thorcode: I forget that
 Urutar: np^^
 Thorcode: bc I only use python :joy:
 Goulamander: I need to learn some php for onlineshop
 Goulamander: and some WordPress plugins
 Urutar: Alright, maybe check under Activities -&gt; Learn and the ncheck the box for php
 Urutar: Or try some online tutorials
 Goulamander: I think tutorials are lot easier
 Urutar: Me too&#160;:)
 Thorcode: not me
 Goulamander: bb it was good to talk with you Urutar &amp; Co. You're very kind to me&#160;:)
 Goulamander: were
 Urutar: For a programming language you don't know? If you don't know any, really? I'd suggest tutorials&#160;:)
 Urutar: Or a mentor
 Thorcode: who is co
 Urutar: No biggy^^
 Goulamander: I've a indian mentor for docker
 Thorcode: what lang do you use Urutar?
 Urutar: Mostly C#/.net
 Thorcode: what that
 Urutar: Done some puzzles/CoCs in ruby, python, java, javascript, bash, c, c++ and maybe some others
 Urutar: C#?
 Thorcode: ah
 Urutar: Similar to java
 Urutar: Belongs to the .net [dot-net] family of microsoft
 Urutar: C# I mean
 Thorcode: How that lang print?
 Urutar: Console.WriteLine()Console.Error.WriteLine()
 Thorcode: it is similiar to c++
 Urutar: Or if you useusing static System.Console;WriteLine or Write
 Urutar: Yeah, it is related to it&#160;:)
 Urutar: C, C++ and C# share some common ancestors&#160;;)
 Thorcode: really
 Urutar: Yup yup
 Thorcode: ah yes
 derjack: because they share the name
 derjack: just like java and javascript are the same :V
 Jerrasterix: :rofl:
 Urutar: Not just that - C# for example was developed based on C and C++
 Jerrasterix: its the successor to C++ right. arrange 2 ++ under the ++ in C++ you will get C#
 Jerrasterix: * one ++ not 2
 5DN1L: People might believe that javascript is a script written in java :imp:
 Urutar: Oh wow. That is wrong on so many levels XD
 AnkidoIcho: hello
 Jerrasterix: nahhh... some people in my pre college think so 
 Urutar: It's sometimes unbelievable which things some people believe
 Urutar: That must be frustrating
 Jerrasterix: they are mislead by "java" in both of the words
 Jerrasterix: very, but I mostly sleep during CS class so np really about that 
 Urutar: XD
 5DN1L: wow, C# is actually C++++ :joy:
 Jerrasterix: yeah.. :lol:
 Urutar: Double the fun and half the power XD
 Jerrasterix: you forgot quarter the headaches xD
 5DN1L: The 4+ thing is actually stated in the C# wikipedia entry
 Jerrasterix: yup... It was quoted by the C# designer, Andres
 Urutar: Isn't that just lazy name selection? XD

 Thorcode: in botter
 5DN1L: What do you mean by 'control'?
 Thorcode: like using it
 Thorcode: I always use hulk skill for deadpool
 Thorcode: bc there is 2 unit I can control
 5DN1L: Read the output section of the statement
 5DN1L: You choose a hero then choose an action
 Thorcode: thanks, I think I could do this
 Thorcode: How could I know my hero mana specify
 5DN1L: You can also observe what the default boss outputs
 Thorcode: how?
 5DN1L: You look at the console output
 5DN1L: Both your outputs and the boss's outputs are there
 Thorcode: ah yeah
 5DN1L: Then you know when and what to output the heroes' names and the actions
 Thorcode: but I need to specify my hero mana
 5DN1L: What do you mean by specifying mana?
 Thorcode: it just give me the mana, I don't know how can I use skill
 Thorcode: like if i use if mana&gt;=40:print("Counter")
 5DN1L: and your question is?
 Thorcode: how can I add for hulk
 5DN1L: Study how the boss outputs its actions
 Thorcode: I can Just use deadpool skill

 5DN1L: Urutar Weirdly your code just outputs the input message itself :open_mouth:
 5DN1L: And this happens only for validator 5
 5DN1L: I'm not testing further, but have you somehow chosen variables which do not shift or multiply at all?
 5DN1L: Just a wild guess
 5DN1L: Or some calculation which amounts to that
 eulerscheZahl: "Weirdly your code just outputs the input message itself "but can you output your own code?

 monkey-11-11: hello
 unBajet: How can i learn the basics of a programing language??
 Wontonimo: by practicing the basics 
 Wontonimo: how basic do you need?
 jacek: q basic
 Wontonimo: and what programming language
 Wontonimo: and do you already know another programming language or just totally new?
 monkey-11-11: hello
 Wontonimo: no monkey business
 monkey-11-11: hahaha
 e_fishel: what new programming language should i learn? 
 e_fishel: i know js and c++
 monkey-11-11: python 3
 Wontonimo: how well do you know them?
 Wontonimo: can you do hard puzzles here?
 e_fishel: i'd say i know a lot of vanilla js
 e_fishel: i bet i can
 Wontonimo: okay, try this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/mini-sudoku-solver">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/mini-sudoku-solver</a>
 e_fishel: alright
 unBajet: I want C++ or C#
 Wontonimo: cool!
 unBajet: And i want the basics of the basics
 Wontonimo: and do you know any others unBajet&#160;?
 unBajet: no
 monkey-11-11: how do i make the thrust faster
 Wontonimo: change the value in the print line.  i think it is 30 or something like that to start.  switch it to 100
 monkey-11-11: thanks
 Wontonimo: total basics, idk.  Personally I'd suggest spending 2 weeks on scratch.mit.edu first
 Wontonimo: and try to make a ball bounce across the screen unless you press 'P' to make it pause, then "S" to make it start again
 Wontonimo: there are tutorials there
 unBajet: ok
 Wontonimo: and being scratch it is very visual
 Wontonimo: noone makes anything serious with scratch, but it is a VERY friendly interface for getting started with the concepts
 unBajet: I know scratchIts the only programming i Know
 Wontonimo: oh.  ok
 Wontonimo: have you make loops, conditions, and functions in scratch?
 jacek: itchy and scratchy?
 unBajet: yes
 Wontonimo: oh!  why didn't you say so
 unBajet: Bc i don't see scratch as a programming language
 The_King_of_Demons: it's not
 Wontonimo: okay, go back into scratch and use it to calculate the square root of a number
 Wontonimo: The_King_of_Demons IT IS!  it is turing comlete
 unBajet: ok
 Wontonimo: but don't use the square root operator
 Wontonimo: instead estimate the value
 unBajet: okay
 jacek: pow(x,0.5) [solved]
 e_fishel: thonk
 Wontonimo: by guessing an answer, squaring it
 Wontonimo: no jacek, that isn't the point
 Wontonimo: if the square is too high, then lower your gess
 Wontonimo: if the square is too low then raise your guess
 Wontonimo: each time your modify your guess do it geometrically using a second variable as the range and decrease the range each time
 Wontonimo: alterrnatively if you think you could do that anyway, just skip to python and try these <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>
 unBajet: ok
 Wontonimo: let me know how it goes unBajet&#160;!
 unBajet: I have no idea how to make a Square root
 Westicles: the world also needs plumbers
 jacek: use method newton, derive from x^2, ezpz
 unBajet: I am in Eighth gradeI don't know every mathematical equation in the world
 5DN1L: unBajet Say you know the square root of 16 and the square root of 25. How would you estimate the square root of 18?
 jacek: square root... quite random exercise to be honest
 unBajet: 3 * radical of 2
 unBajet: Idk how to write this 
 Westicles: why are you making a 12 year old with no programming experience take square roots?
 unBajet: I am 14 btw
 5DN1L: Westicles ask Wontonimo :shrug:
 5DN1L: unBajet, say you want to estimate the square root of 18. It's between 4 and 5, right? What you can do, using code, is to find some values in between, and test the values, so that you are closer and closer to the actual value
 5DN1L: e.g. 4.5 * 4.5 = 20.25
 5DN1L: now we will narrow down either to the range 4 to 4.5, or the range 4.5 to 5
 5DN1L: based on which range will give a closer value to the square root of 18
 Uljahn: quite nice problem though, you can also use it to learn binary search
 unBajet: thx
 Westicles: I've still got my million digits of pi puzzle somewhere, that might be nice for a next step...
 PakSmith: In Scratch look under operators for the "abs" block. When you drag that into your program you can change it to sqrt
 unBajet: Yeahthat is another method
 PakSmith: Scratch is a perfectly capable programming language, it can just get a bit hard to manage the logic once the programs get larger and complex
 jacek: the point is to calculate square root without sqrt and apparently without pow(x,0.5)
 Wontonimo: or something else!  really, sqrt was just an example
 PakSmith: Right, sorry. Just joined and that had scrolled out of chat
 5DN1L: PakSmith, no worries
 Wontonimo: what i like about using scratch for something so ridiculously mathy is  that it really highlights that you can do regular programming with it
 5DN1L: This just illustrates all the different possibilities of coding
 5DN1L: different codes can achieve similar results
 Wontonimo: heck, make a scratch game where badgers fall from the sky and you have to dodge them
 Wontonimo: display a score
 Wontonimo: when the score is 13 show a screen that says "HARD MODE ENABLED", then make the badgers fall at double speed and make twice as many of them
 Wontonimo: the score is the number of badgers that fall off the bottom of the screen
 Wontonimo: extra credit&#160;: make the badgers of various sizes (random) and spin (some fast some slow) and descent (some a bit on an angle)
 Westicles: unBajet, just google 'learn python'
 unBajet: ok
 Wontonimo: lol
 5DN1L: the above exercises can be modified for practising whatever programming language :P
 unBajet: ok
 unBajet: I have to go`Goodbye
 jacek: even html?
 5DN1L: try it :smirk:
 Wontonimo: whhere did PakSmith go&#160;?
 jacek: to scratch
 Wontonimo: to scratch what?
 jacek: yes
 5DN1L: to school maybe?
 5DN1L: look at PakSmith's profile
 Wontonimo: people still *go* to that thing?
 Wontonimo: how 2019's of them
 jacek: oh my
 Westicles: not in australia.  that's a police state now
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Howdareu: how to write square root in c# pls help fast
 jacek: Math.Sqrt()
 Howdareu: thnx
 5DN1L: Chat is faster than Google? :joy:
 Howdareu: honestly yes
 5DN1L: You're just lucky :P
 jacek: Oo
 GER-NaN: Math.Sqrt() should work  :innocent:
 Wontonimo: Math.Sqrt() is the function you are looking for Howdareu
 Howdareu: jacek already told me but thnx anyways
 DylanGTech: Whew. Second C# lesson up on Learn. My first one has nearl 2k views and over 40 likes :D
 Wontonimo: but now you *really* know Howdareu.  We could keep telling you so you won't forget ...  :P
 jacek: or you could make your own sqrt
 Vaylx: Man. I can barely understand what's being asked of me in these problems... geez.
 Wontonimo: yeah, i hear you could use pow.  only rumours though
 jacek: or you can make nn to do that
 Wontonimo: especially if it has the right activation function
 Uljahn: just make another nn to approximate that activation function
 Wontonimo: with all these NNs, we'll have to somehow get the right training hyper parameters.  you could use a GA for that
 jacek: but you need right population size and mutation rate for GA. you'd find those with PSO
 Wontonimo: good call
 GER-NaN: any puzzles that you need some kind of machine learning, where heuristics wont work?
 jacek: hmm, games?
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/binary-neural-network---part-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/binary-neural-network---part-1</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ that
 5DN1L: and then
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/binary-neural-network---part-2">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/binary-neural-network---part-2</a>
 GER-NaN: I saw those but they look pretty nasty.
 Wontonimo: oh, like *easy* machine learning
 Wontonimo: just solve a regular puzzle using ML.  Nothing forcing you to use heuristics
 Wontonimo: try Mars Lander 2 and 3
 Wontonimo: or botters of the galaxy
 GER-NaN: Thats right, I choose not to us machine learning because its harder to understand. 
 GER-NaN: Good point. Ill just force myself to use it and then Ill probably grasp the ideas.
 Wontonimo: sorry, didn't mean it like that.  my appologies if it was offencive.  really.  sorry
 Wontonimo: when you say ML, do you mean NN or just any AI kind of thing?
 jacek: mars lander :v
 Wontonimo: like, would MCTS fall under ML for your purposes?
 GER-NaN: not sure what MCTS stand for but any kind of machine learning, just to gets tarted coding it.
 jacek: as simple as parameters optimization?
 Wontonimo: how about code that plays checkers by looking at future moves?  would you call that ML&#160;?
 GER-NaN: I could code that with a few arrays and if statements, so  no...
 GER-NaN: maybe im just thinking about it wrong
 Wontonimo: it's often called minimax or alphabeta, and requires a tree structure.  Okay, yeah could be done with arrays
 jacek: you can make perfect tic tac toe with bunch of ifs. but you can still learn minimax or mcts on it
 Wontonimo: jacek nailed it with parameter optimization
 jacek: machine learning is very broad. parameters optimizations are i.e. genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, hill climbing etc.
 5DN1L: are e.g.*
 GER-NaN: Ill look into some of these for the simple puzzles. I've finished Mars Lander but its just a bunch of heuristics, Ill try to implement some of these algorithms suggested here
 jacek: oh your right <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/know-your-latin-i-e-vs-e-g/">https://www.grammarly.com/blog/know-your-latin-i-e-vs-e-g/</a>
 jacek: search race is nice for genetic algorithm
 Wontonimo: genetic algorithms are a great place to cut your teeth (so to speak) on ML.  It drives home that you need a good measure of success and degrees of success.
 Wontonimo: check out this tutorial <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/</a>
 jacek: tweaking evaluation by GA is what made me pass this week's puzzle of the week
 AntiSquid: GER-NaN not the site for that. Try kaggle instead lol
 jacek: huh
 AntiSquid: he asked about ML
 jacek: and why CG not for that
 NotANick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.php.net/manual/tr/function.gmp-gcd.php">https://www.php.net/manual/tr/function.gmp-gcd.php</a>
 Wontonimo: i don't even think he is listening anymore
 AntiSquid: it has no support for it, zero
 NotANick: this function is not working on here and not new function
 NotANick: i want to beat phython guys with php
 AntiSquid: language updates take time NotANick
 AntiSquid: you'll be waiting
 NotANick: I know i just want to update no matter time
 NotANick: thanks
 jacek: its from php4?
 NotANick: yes? php4and +?
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/languages-versions</a>
 5DN1L: Maybe it's not a version issue, it's just that the extension isn't supported here?
 NotANick: "(PHP 4 &gt;= 4.0.4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)"
 5DN1L: extension not supported &lt;- Just my guess.
 struct: it doesnt have gmp package
 NotANick: you can add extensions from php.ini and its really easy thing
 e_fishel: ɑl ɹaiɪt
 e_fishel: alright
 e_fishel: i did it
 e_fishel: with some help
 e_fishel: but it's done
 NotANick: nvm
 NotANick: and sorry for disturbing
 5DN1L: No worries, totally all right to ask
 Wontonimo: wow jacek , your 9mm bot is unstoppable.  Congrats
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: and this isnt my final form
 jacek: why msmits hasnt solved it yet is beyond me
 jacek: and i havent seen him here for quite some time
 jacek: did he solve c4 yet?
 Wontonimo: i don't think so
 jacek: so hes ashamed and hasnt come back
 LuxyDuxy: :peanuts:
 Alois.S: Hi, does anyone know when the coding points are calculated&#160;?
 gshek18: :peanuts:
 flakerimi: @alois after 24 hours
 Scronc: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
 AntiSquid: every day at french midnight actually flakerimi alois.s
 GamingGnawer: in c++ If I have a vector of pointers and pop.back.Can I still use the pointed object without issue?
 Superwog1: still waiting for an ass reverse problem so I can fullfil my 3rd language in codingame
 GamingGnawer: Or has pop.back just destroyed that "copy" of the objects adress?
 pmor: make sure something else is 'owning' whatever you're pointing to
 pmor: then you can push and pop form the vector without issue
 pmor: and use the pointer afterwards
 NoahTheDovah: for shadows of the knight ep1 does anyone know what to do cause i am stuck
 GamingGnawer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/187c9cd3-e731-483a-8076-9064c36c4dfb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/187c9cd3-e731-483a-8076-9064c36c4dfb</a>
 NotANick: you will play with your position and width and height
 Westicles: you can get all the languages with NS
 NotANick: yes xd
 pmor:  GamingGnawer depends how you instantiated and pushed it into the vector
 AntiSquid: NoahTheDovah split search space until you narrow it down ...
 GamingGnawer: I'm thinking calling this add function
 pmor: if you have something else outside of the vector monitoring the lifetime, then what you posted is ok
 GamingGnawer: void add(State* state) {
 GamingGnawer: With a "new State"
 pmor: yes, you can do that
 pmor: you just have to be careful to monitor the lifetime or you could end up leaking the memory of the state or crashing if something else deletes your state
 GamingGnawer: Is there a much better way to this kind of thing, or is "be careful not to leak" just the nature of c++
 pmor: usually I have something else that 'owns' pointers
 pmor: usually a pool, which is just a large array 
 pmor: the pool gives out pointers, which you can then add to vectors and such
 GamingGnawer: Gives out Pointers to itself - to where the actual objectptr is stored
 pmor: If you get into the mindset of 'what owns the lifetime of this', you don't run into too many problems
 pmor: more accurately its gives out pointers to elements it maintains
 NotANick: which is faster for program? if or else if(same statement else if doesnt affect to program)
 NotANick: for same statement*
 GamingGnawer: So the advantage of the pool is that if I forget to "delete" my pointers I end up with a bloated array rather than an invisble leak?
 pmor: yes
 pmor: tracking down a crash due to the memory underneath the pointer being freed is not fun
 GamingGnawer: But the pool-array contains ptr also?Like I could add to the constructor to push it's pointer to pool?
 pmor: it could, if you allocated it
 pmor: but then make sure your pool is the one that would delete it
 GamingGnawer: and in that case I'm not using new
 pmor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/10cc75cb-7c62-4115-8b6d-d0c589fbc221">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/10cc75cb-7c62-4115-8b6d-d0c589fbc221</a>
 pmor: that's a super simple pool
 pmor: you can then take those pointers and put them into vectors and pop then out when you want
 pmor: at the start of a new turn, you can call reset and reuse the states in the buffer
 GamingGnawer: So this has basically created 50 000 state objects at the start and then I just fish them out as needed
 GamingGnawer: If my program uses 50 001 I assume I'll crash... but is the memory use static at 50 000 States even if I only use 10?
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 Stephen20: print('Hello world!')
 GamingGnawer: Hello back!
 UZUHAMA: :DD
 Thorcode: hello world
 Thorcode: Stephen20 how can you know that super pro code could beat any puzzle?
 Stephen20: what-
 Thorcode: the super print code
 Stephen20: oh lol
 Thorcode: I have not know that code
 Thorcode: how to use "print"
 Wontonimo: hey pmor , i'd change the code a bit to just return pos
 Wontonimo: instead of a pointerj
 Thorcode: Botters is not as ez as I think
 Wontonimo: oh, you've jumped up on UTTT pmor about 5 spots
 Wontonimo: yeah, i didn't do too much with botters, but definitely not a cake walk
 Thorcode: most of my pod are bronze&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: bots or pods?
 Xyph9r: can someone help 
 GamingGnawer: what with?
 Wontonimo: just help i guess
 Wontonimo: too late, he ded
 GamingGnawer: I know the feeling XD
 pmor: Wontonimo yeah, a little.  Played around a bit yesterday but not having much luck improving my position
 Wontonimo: yeah, i was stuck at around that level and had to rewrite my bot
 Wontonimo: three times
 pmor: i got an 10% speed improvement, and added a bit more heuristics for the first 20 or so moves
 pmor: Stopped working on it cause the company challenge started
 pmor: I still need to test it a little more than resubmit
 Wontonimo: what's the company challenge?
 pmor: called outer conquest
 pmor: reminds me of the witches brew contest
 Wontonimo: is it public or just at work?
 pmor: just work
 GamingGnawer: I have this thing:vector&lt;State*&gt; hash[15]{};Inside StateHash
 GamingGnawer: And do this:stateHash1.hash[i].size()
 GamingGnawer: no wait, I do this:stateHash1.hash[7].pop_back();
 jacek: :thinking:
 GamingGnawer: But this:for (int i{0}; i &lt; 15; ++i) {            cerr&lt;&lt;stateHash1.hash[i].size()&lt;&lt;'\n';}
 GamingGnawer: returns the same...
 GamingGnawer: i.e. pop back... didn't work
 GamingGnawer: is hash not an array of 15 vectors?
 jacek: stateHash1 size was 15 after you pop_back?
 GamingGnawer: The for-loop gives the sizes of all 15 containers in hash
 GamingGnawer: and they don't change
 pmor: I assume you're adding 15 elements, get the size which is 15, then pop_back(), and then get the size again?
 pmor: And it's still 15?
 GamingGnawer: No... the size() of hash is 15, should always be 15.But it should be 15 vectors
 GamingGnawer: who each have their own sizes
 pmor: What you posted looks to be the case
 GamingGnawer: for (vector&lt;State*&gt; scoreBracket:hash) {
 jacek: array of vectors *_*
 GamingGnawer: This thing is missbehaving
 GamingGnawer: does the for (auto x:y) not allowx.pop_backBecause it makes a copy or smthing?
 jacek: try auto &amp; x&#160;: y
 pmor: ^ you're doing it by value
 pmor: so it's copying a vector for you, doing the pop_back(), and then it throws it away when it goes out of scope
 GamingGnawer:&#160;!
 pmor: auto&amp; will pass it by reference, so any changes you do will apply to the vector you passed in
 GamingGnawer: Solved by this changefor (int i{0}; i &lt; 15; ++i) {
 GamingGnawer: auto&amp;looks much prettier
 pmor: its the same as vector&lt;State*&gt;&amp;
 pmor: the &amp; is the thing you're missing
 GamingGnawer: Yeah got it, I just assumed the x:y was a reference by default
 GamingGnawer: And all this so my bot can simulate all outcomes and then pick the first one in the list anyway ^^
 GamingGnawer: But that's enough for tonight!Thanks for the help!
 GamingGnawer: Cya
 pmor: later
 Thorcode: Wontonimo could you help me how to print with z=input to print?
 Thorcode: or anyone?
 Wontonimo: sure
 Wontonimo: z=inputz("hello world")
 Thorcode: ah
 Thorcode: thanks alot
 Thorcode: how about using that z
 Thorcode: that's trick kinda hard for me
 Aquajag: i'm trying out python. i'm new here. a major struggle with all the games, even the easy ones i'm supposed to start with, is that the "input" comes as a "line" of things. I need to be able to get to some of the things. i.e. monopoly the "line" is both a name and a number (starting space). how do i access those various date? is the input a list? a string? an array? I can't figure out how to step through the pieces.
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: I could not understand what you are talking?
 Wontonimo: let's start with something a little specific <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 Wontonimo: have you tried this puzzle Aquajag&#160;?
 Wontonimo: it is considered one of the easiest on the site
 Aquajag: yes @Wontonimo. It's one of the few I could crack
 Xyph9r: one of the easiest he says yet I couldnt figure it out HEHE 
 Xyph9r: :grimacing:
 Wontonimo: okay, great.  let me get you another ... just a sec
 Thorcode: some of the easiet have ans won
 Thorcode: in the hint section
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/temperatures</a>
 Wontonimo: check out temperatures ^^ this one
 Aquajag: but the issue there is each input was a single number. my problem is games where the input is a line. how do i access, say, the second number of the input.
 Wontonimo: tell me if you can do that
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: a,b,c = input().split()
 Wontonimo: to get a, b, and c
 Wontonimo: or if it is a liststuff_as_list = input().input()
 Thorcode: oh my god I could not even know how my code doing now
 Wontonimo: sorry
 Aquajag: i'm trying to do monopoly and can't figure out how to get just the starting position from the input so i can add to it
 Wontonimo: stuff_as_list = input().split()
 Thorcode: hay
 Aquajag: ok. i tried that, and it didn't work quite as expected. I'll play some more. thanks.

 Thorcode: I was think that it was stuff,as,list=intput().split()?
 Aquajag: yes wontonimo that one
 Wontonimo: it is medium
 Wontonimo: medium here is actually really REALLY challenging for someone without a degree or 2 years experience
 Thorcode: ah Aquajag you are trying to do the path
 Aquajag: well i see that now! but the code path said "do loops" and i was trying to get ones that didn't assume i also knew how to do arrays or ascii conversion or hexadecimal or codebreaking! &gt;D
 Thorcode: the Algorithms one
 Wontonimo: look at the community success rate&#160;!  30% of people who attempt it pass
 Aquajag: once upon a time i had both a degree and 2 yrs experience in C++. but that was many moons ago.
 Xyph9r: its okay i just got my computer science degree and i feel like i cant do any of these LUL 
 Wontonimo: get the rust off in the 'easy' section first
 Thorcode: nah

 Wontonimo: seriously, a year ago I had trouble with the easy ones also.  just get the rust off.  work up the muscles
 Aquajag: i did look at the codebreaker, and i also thought, how do i step through the input...

 Wontonimo: Do it!  Maybe not today or tomorrow, but that dragon will wait for you to come slaughter it
 Thorcode: this is ez as ep 1
 Thorcode: believe me
 Thorcode: even when I only get 40%
 Aquajag: in C++  we could do "variable ++" to accomplish "variable = variable + 1". what's the similar in python?
 Wontonimo: variable +=1
 Aquajag: thanks
 UZUHAMA: It seems to me that Java and C++ are so similar in syntax
 UZUHAMA: I wonder why
 Thorcode: yeah and c
 Thorcode: too
 UZUHAMA: yeah
 Wontonimo: because first there was C, then C++ and they inspired quite a few programming languages which just kinda copied them.  other than weird ones like Lisp
 Thorcode: python could do var=var+1
 Thorcode: not only var+=1
 Wontonimo: Java was one to copy C++, taking the good but adding things to protect the programmer from themselves, like memory and semaphore helpers
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 wana solo?
 Automaton2000: how would i do that too
 UZUHAMA: Oh, ok
 Wontonimo: Java was supposed to be something like C++ but able to be run on any computer or toaster
 Thorcode: it's nice to talk with you Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but only if you have no idea how much it takes for me to get a list of all the ...
 Wontonimo: seriously, it was supposed to run on toasters
 UZUHAMA: I heard that Java was primarily the language for remote controller or something
 Thorcode: really
 Thorcode: I thought it was c++
 Thorcode: right Automaton200?
 Wontonimo: yeah, but because thhe internet was just budding
 UZUHAMA: That's what I heard of
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 could you slap me?
 Automaton2000: why did you say something
 Wontonimo: and lots of different computers with different operating systems were around, java was able to run on all of them.  c++ had to recompile for each one
 Thorcode: ah nice
 Wontonimo: you could run java in the browser but you couldn't with c++
 Thorcode: I will ask Automaton2000 for the ans
 Automaton2000: i guess it's a matter of time
 Wontonimo: so java filled a niche, and gained vast popularity
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 could you run c++ on the browser?
 Automaton2000: am i the only one i can do to get out of hand
 UZUHAMA: History class
 Thorcode: yep
 Westicles: lisp was the only language they taught at my college
 UZUHAMA: I learned about Java's histroy, but I forgot about everything
 Thorcode: I thought it was python
 Thorcode: I have learned nothing
 UZUHAMA: All I know is that Java's name was Oak at the beginning
 Thorcode: about the history
 Thorcode: of code
 Thorcode: I just know that turing is the father of com
 UZUHAMA: Didn't Turing kill himself?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: he suicided
 Westicles: no, it was murder
 Thorcode: really?
 UZUHAMA: Idk my memory's already fading
 UZUHAMA: Was it murder?
 Westicles: officially it was suicide, but they killed him
 UZUHAMA: who
 Thorcode: who?
 Aquajag: THEY
 UZUHAMA: anti-programmer?
 Wontonimo: murder by suicide
 Thorcode: who is they
 UZUHAMA: murdered by HIMSELF
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum this is the first time I know that Guido van Rossum is the father of Python
 Thorcode: thanks Guido van Rossum alot
 UZUHAMA: Wait
 UZUHAMA: It was made in 1980s?
 UZUHAMA: I thought it was made in 2000s, at the earliest

 Stephen20: 69 and 420 represent inappropriate words
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Stephen20: DO NOT search them up
 UZUHAMA: is it Simplified Monopoly, Aquajag?
 Westicles: 4/20 was hitler's birthday and stoners love hitler
 Aquajag: yes uzuhama. i'm having a problem with lucky doubles
 UZUHAMA: Oh thx
 UZUHAMA: I wanted to try the puzzle out, too
 Wontonimo: isn't 42 the ultimate answer, and if you have it for every finger and thumb than it is 420, 10x the ultimate answer
 Aquajag: hmmm
 UZUHAMA: I heard somewhere that 42 is the perfect number &amp; is holy
 Wontonimo: no?  that wasn't funny
 Aquajag: next birthday i presume i will know everything since my age will be the ultimate answer
 Wontonimo: i'll try again
 maxcav: hi
 UZUHAMA: Aquajag lol
 UZUHAMA: maxcav hi
 bobby69420: im not holy plz stop talking about me
 UZUHAMA: haha

 Thorcode: really
 UZUHAMA: :thinking:
 Westicles: well, no
 UZUHAMA: Dang
 Stephen20: SUS
 UZUHAMA: "Code vs Zombies" is harder than I thought it would be 
 Wontonimo: cuz zombies
 UZUHAMA: "Plants vs Zombies " is much easier than this...
 Westicles: I've been putting off all these hard CG puzzles forever, maybe I should do one.  I hate pathfinding
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: code vs zombies you could just go round a gy to win easier
 Aquajag: well never mind, didn't beat monopoly but got the first 4 cases. i shall return. gnight all
 UZUHAMA: bye
 UZUHAMA: Thorcode what?
 Thorcode: really
 Thorcode: just go round a human and protect him to get 100%
 Thorcode: but not really good point
 UZUHAMA: That's my goal for now
 UZUHAMA: But one of the case prevents me from doing that
 Thorcode: are you trying to do 40K in its?
 UZUHAMA: Not for now
 Thorcode: ok
 UZUHAMA: I guess I'll improve it a bit by bit
 UZUHAMA: Ooh
 UZUHAMA: I can repeat what I said early by pressing the upper arrow key
 UZUHAMA: Didn't know that, neither
 Thorcode: really
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: that's nice
 UZUHAMA: yeah
 Thorcode: could someone help me to go to ghost in soul snatchers
 Thorcode: The rest I could solve XD
 Wontonimo: what do you mean "go to the ghost"?
 Wontonimo: find thhem?
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: like move to it
 Wontonimo: do you have their coordinates?
 Thorcode: nah
 Wontonimo: so, you need to get their coordinates right?
 Thorcode: I could not find it
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: how could you get the coordinates?
 Thorcode:     for i in range(entities):
 Wontonimo: (hint&#160;: it is in the description)
 BlaiseEbuth: Ask him kindly.
 Thorcode: this line is almost I I have
 Thorcode: blaise, where is your old nick
 BlaiseEbuth: Who's old nick?
 Thorcode: the level 21
 Thorcode: not this level3
 BlaiseEbuth: Account you mean
 Thorcode: yeah
 BlaiseEbuth: Dead
 Thorcode: why?
 Wontonimo: rip
 BlaiseEbuth: This one is the v6
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: who's is the v5
 BlaiseEbuth: dead, like v2, v3 and v4...
 Thorcode: you kill all of that guy?
 Wontonimo: wait, are you Dr Who?
 UZUHAMA: lol
 Thorcode: sad BlaiseEbuth
 Westicles: 29/51 of friends I follow are deleted or banned...
 Thorcode: can nick be deleted by mod?
 BlaiseEbuth: Well only 5 of them were me.
 Westicles: only 1 was me
 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 Thorcode: really?
 BlaiseEbuth: really what?
 Westicles: I wonder if they would hook shikaku solver back up to me if I asked nicely
 Thorcode: ah I forgot that the last ver you are using
 BlaiseEbuth: Not a priority
 Thorcode: how long is a ban took?
 BlaiseEbuth: Forever
 Thorcode: really
 Wontonimo: oh, i thought it was only for 1e60 seconds
 Thorcode: bruh "only 1e60 sec"
 Thorcode: why mod have no unban command?
 Westicles: they do, they just don't want people begging for it
 Thorcode: ah it will makes mod being annoyed
 Thorcode: I will caculate 1e60 sec
 Nige: 3 years
 Thorcode: really
 Wontonimo: 1e60 is not 3 years
 Thorcode: nah
 Thorcode: it is not really 3 years
 UZUHAMA: It's more than that, I'm pretty sure
 Nige: Oh, 3 e52&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: 3e53 years
 Wontonimo: yup
 Nige: So the universe will run out long before
 Wontonimo: no, the universe will still be around, it just that all the stars will have run out of fuel
 Nige: Once the heat death happens, it may as well not be around
 Thorcode: 3.1688764615412794e+52
 BlaiseEbuth: Tsss... Stars probably have a bad score at mars lander...
 Thorcode: about these years
 trebel: im just tryna to learn how to code the heck are you lot talkin about
 UZUHAMA: ToO mUcH nUmBeRs
 Wontonimo: heath death is a poor linear approximation of the current situation, there the is no good evidence that the current cosmic inflation will continue
 Westicles: Nah, the universe is closed and will collapse eventually once they discover dark dark matter
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: trebel do this
 Thorcode: a=1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b=31556926print(a/b)
 Thorcode: I use print(str(0)*60) write the "0" 
 Wontonimo: or just simply1e60/31556926
 Thorcode: really
 Wontonimo: or better yet1e60/3.154e7
 Thorcode: bruh
 Thorcode: I wasn't know that
 Wontonimo: now you do
 Thorcode: yep
 Wontonimo: my job is done
 Thorcode: this is kinda cool
 Thorcode: I won't need to write 100
 Thorcode: could change to 1e2
 UZUHAMA: Bruh my AI so dumb
 Thorcode: Wontonimo could you help me with the coridinate of the ghost pls
 Wontonimo: i was trying but you got off topic
 Thorcode: yeah
 Wontonimo: your hunters only see so much.  read the game details.
 Thorcode: the world chat sometime kill me out of the topic
 Westicles: which is easier, thor2 or labyrinth?
 Thorcode: thor 2
 Thorcode: I have done 40% of it
 Wontonimo: so you need to move your hunters out into the world so they ahve a chance to see the ghosts
 DeliciouslyNull: Hello all, new to the platform. How is everyone? 
 Thorcode: ah
 UZUHAMA: Hello
 Wontonimo: i speak for everyone&#160;: great thanks
 Thorcode: I think I would make a var to do that
 Thorcode: thanks
 Thorcode: probably that the bots contest is not ez as puzzle
 Wontonimo: iirc Thorcode, I created a grid system and kept track if i've explorded a grid square.  
 Wontonimo: if a hunter doesn't have a task, i sent them to an unexpored grid square 
 Thorcode: like if they won?
 Wontonimo: forget about winning for now.  just write a script that makes your hunters (busters whatever) explore the whole map
 Wontonimo: in an efficient manner
 Thorcode: ok
 ur_momM: kill me 
 ur_momM: ]
 Thorcode: thanks Wontonimo
 Thorcode: thanks to this site, I can learn new things in code in almost every day
 Thorcode: wow Aude Barral is kinda popular

 ddreams: I do 3 shifts + 1 filter for 3-shadow, 2 shifts for 2, 1 shift for 1
 ddreams: it's just a single &amp; tho
 struct: probably similar ddreams
 struct: I think
 BrunoFelthes: is it better to use another kind of index?
 struct: But i dont really need to filter
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/FgBBsgb">https://imgur.com/a/FgBBsgb</a>that's something I shared last week
 eulerscheZahl: the idea is to have same difference of value in each direction
 eulerscheZahl: you have a list of set bits. and you shift all by 7 to cast the shadow up-right
 BrunoFelthes: nice
 ddreams: I use this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage">https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but for longer shadows you have to unset the bits that are out of the map
 eulerscheZahl: struct found a way to avoid the unset
 struct: you can share the pic euler
 struct: if you want
 eulerscheZahl: if i find it again
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/RC6GgTJ">https://imgur.com/a/RC6GgTJ</a>
 kovi: 37 pos &lt; 64-3*8 so it is possible

 PatrickMcGinnisII: i added a 37th cell
 ZarthaxX: :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and just compute only those i'm interested in
 PatrickMcGinnisII: $shbydir=[[[1,7,19],[2,9,22],[3,11,25],[4,13,28],[5,15,31],[6,17,34]], <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/284e7f45-3a3d-44f7-b7ad-b10eeed560f8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/284e7f45-3a3d-44f7-b7ad-b10eeed560f8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you added a 37th? there are 37 already
 PatrickMcGinnisII: [index][day][size]
 ClockSort: struct did you get mcts going?
 struct: I dont know duct mcts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok 0-37, 38 of them
 struct: so no
 eulerscheZahl: 0-36, you added 37. which is the 38th cell
 PatrickMcGinnisII: adding a simple day=(day+1)%6 makes it easy to estimate 'future' shadows for grow evals that are equal
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm gonna resub for the final time
 ddreams: huh.. I missed one separator bit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my depth 2 failed
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db7d18a7-0b45-4b9f-a8a7-ef44204f23b7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db7d18a7-0b45-4b9f-a8a7-ef44204f23b7</a>
 ddreams: that's why I have to filter
 ddreams: though that single bit and is not what broke my bot :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: game isn't really memory intensive, just execution ... I use a couple shifts, but it's not worth the coding/encoding imho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php uses 4 bytes for an int...so 38*4=154 bytes...could store thousands of boards if i could get the darn tree to work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i can't multiply either
 Wontonimo: it's not about saving space in RAM, it's about saving space on L1 and L2 cache 
 eulerscheZahl: you need 8 bytes for proper bitboarding
 ddreams: and doing parallel operations 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gave it a go, but i still had to clear bits so it wasn't saving me time
 _Code_breakeR_: hi
 Wontonimo: i tried packing instead of boarding... if you like your code to run 3x slower than the competition, I'd recommend it.
 ddreams: I'll do another long shot submit... not really better locally, but let's see
 struct: Sometimes is not worth to save bytes
 ddreams: 3/10 .. almost certainly worse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was 735th b4 this last submit, so i'll see how it goes and throw in the towel
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the first 5 moves are pretty standardized
 ddreams: ok, this is clearly worse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the first 11 moves are VERY patterned
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my endgame sux
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gl ddreams
 ClockSort: do you guys use priority_queue&lt;state&gt; for your beam search?
 struct: array
 ClockSort: how do you run the beam? sort(arr.begin()+depth, arr.begin()+depthEnd)&#160;?
 struct: nth_element
 ddreams: nth_element
 ClockSort: :eyes:
 ClockSort: thanks
 pmor: nth_element is way better than sort in this situation
 ClockSort: yeah, because you don't need to sort what you throw away
 ddreams: and you don't need to sort what you don't either
 pmor: you don't need to sort what you keep either
 Counterbalance: :sweat_smile:
 pmor: heh
 ddreams: it's basically a partition
 ClockSort: does c# have a function like this?
 ClockSort: right on.
 JohnCM: haha
 ClockSort: you overload operator&lt; on the state class to make nth_element work?
 Wontonimo: gn all, and good luck
 ClockSort: or just pass cmp
 pmor: lamdba funciton
 pmor: lambda function even :P
 JohnCM: so exciting, ppl are resubmitting so much the ranks are fluctuating violently
 ClockSort: nth_element is amazing, i'd never used it
 ClockSort: thanks
 Counterbalance: wow.. lost first 10 games in legend.. maybe top gold was better :D
 ddreams: chat is distracting but also teaching
 Zenoscave: how long are submits rn? Worth  it or should I call it
 Counterbalance: 37 minutes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 10 minutes=39%
 Bernard_Lowe: Does anyone else feel that not pushing your code for awhile results in your rank doing better? Maybe it's just psychological for me.
 ClockSort: @Bernard_Lowe it's true
 Bernard_Lowe: After a submission from say a few hours earlier.
 Zaphus: you are more likely to get a random game with someone resubmitting than with the ones around you - so makes sense
 ddreams: yeah, I can't reach anywhere near my old ranking with the same code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's usually harder the later in the contest to make any real substantial moves, but this game has tight scoring.
 ddreams: and I'm pretty sure it's not because a lot of people have gone past it
 struct: holy only 3:30 hours remaining
 struct: and i didnt do anything
 struct: I should just go to sleep
 Bernard_Lowe: I definitely agree to that @PatrickMcGinnisll. I submitted new code recently and the ranks were much more difficult than 24 hours ago.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: those that push when leagues open fair better in the long run imho
 ClockSort: recurse lead is even more redic now
 ClockSort: more than 5 trueskill pts
 struct: 93% win rate
 struct: decent
 ddreams: back to my 13 hour old code, my last submit
 ddreams: lol, decent
 Bernard_Lowe: I heard recurse didn't submit any code until weekend. Why would he do that?
 pmor: did he ever say what kind of bot it is?
 ClockSort: because he is amazing
 ddreams: so people would not be able to practice against him so easily
 struct: batching has been nerfed
 ClockSort: i think it's NN&#160;?
 struct: dont think its that
 ddreams: well, NN with a search
 ddreams: no idea really
 pmor: in the fall challenge he had an alt account he used in the beginning
 MichaelPu: probably some kind of NN, because he always wins just by a little bit
 ddreams: the mcts algos can also do that
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I watched a little, recurse didn't order the moves...like grow then seed...some went seed then grow... so probably some kinda mcts
 Bernard_Lowe: @pmor is that fair to have an alt account? I guess he's a prominent player.
 struct: why isnt it fair?
 pmor: no idea. I just remember he had an acct that submitted a rust bot before he submitted a c++ bot a few days later
 ddreams: because other top players are not in hiding?
 Bernard_Lowe: If he copy/pasted code for 5 bots to all get top 5, that would be wrong. But I understand not wanting the attention.
 Numby: when you don't submit you also can't test your code vs the top players so there's a tradeoff
 Bernard_Lowe: I wasn't aware all top players are hiding on alts lol.
 ddreams: but anyway, probably better for the game to have alts with visible fights instead of completely hiding until the weekend
 struct: Also there is no proof that he hided
 struct: There is a different from hiding and hiding while batching
 struct: difference*
 Numby: what's batching?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my last version failed, i hate deleting code
 struct: testing vs other players
 ddreams: he said he only tested using the IDE this time
 ClockSort: @PatrickMcGinnisII I went backwards by hours of development time because i was making things worse. don't feel bad&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i wasted days looking for combos
 ddreams: I feel sleepy.. going to bed
 ClockSort: struct what kind of bot do you think recurse used?
 ddreams: gn fun playing with "youse"
 ClockSort: cya ddreams
 struct: i dont know
 pmor: I look forward to his postmortem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but i'm remodelling a house of mine, so I've been pretty tired and zero 10 hour banging out code sessions...I even left CG open and fell asleep once...smh
 Smelty: ye postmortem gonna be cool
 Bernard_Lowe: @pmor where can you read his postmortem, or any of this tournament? Will it be on forums?
 Smelty: lol i probably won't write a post-mortem, im at the bottom of gold
 pmor: Yeah, it'll be in the feedback and strategies thread
 pmor: Here's his from last contest  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/81">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-feedbacks-strategies/187846/81</a>
 Smelty: :0
 PatrickMcGinnisII: give it a couple days, the OG gamers will give a little...but remember there is a game after the contest
 Smelty: yes
 Smelty: ill surf to gold in the game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i bet the bosses will be harder tho, huh struct
 struct: what do you mean?
 Smelty: hmm
 Bernard_Lowe: Also, dumb question, but, what will this challenge be called?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: silver boss won't get harder for after contest game?
 Bernard_Lowe: The Plant Growing Groot Game&#160;:)&#160;?
 Zenoscave: probably spring challenge 2021
 struct: nope
 Zenoscave: they stopped doing names I think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I liked the games ebing named after movies
 eulerscheZahl: soon we will know if the next contest will be an escape one
 Zenoscave: escape contest?
 Zenoscave: like first to finish wins?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/3">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/solo-contests/1114/3</a>
 struct: I hate this&#160;:'(
 Westicles: As the head of team NA, with my first pick I choose reCurse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there used to be old MOO games...is that what escape is?
 eulerscheZahl: shouldn't me be the team head?
 eulerscheZahl: he*
 eulerscheZahl: bad typo
 Westicles: maybe next time
 Zenoscave: Also if it's only going to be a weekend do we still have to wait 6 months
 eulerscheZahl: escape: you see a room and can click around to solve riddles
 eulerscheZahl: follow clues, guess passwords to reach the next stage
 Zenoscave: What coding is involved
 eulerscheZahl: a little bit
 eulerscheZahl: struct knows better
 eulerscheZahl: you should have 1 coder in the team
 struct: tr 'ACGT','TGCA'
 struct: hard puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: are you clashing?
 struct: well its similar
 struct: to a clash
 struct: there is a clash like that
 JohnCM: the escape rooms are pretty fun, i completed them all alr
 struct: or there was
 JohnCM: at least those that were released
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that example is from the escape?
 struct: yes
 Zenoscave: Let me get this striaght. A competition. On a platform designed to be about coding competitions. is going to do a competition needing minimal coding
 eulerscheZahl: not confirmed yet
 Zenoscave: If they do I'm done
 eulerscheZahl: just me being scared of the worst
 struct: the coding difficulty has been on par with easy clashes
 eulerscheZahl: and ClockSort even liked that forum post
 eulerscheZahl: shame on you
 ClockSort: ha
 Zenoscave: shame ClockSort
 Zenoscave: shameeeee
 aangairbender: yeah that escape rooms are not about coding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: beforre the internet, there were MOO servers that would drop you in a kind of maze... you had to run a dictionary and solve seemingly random things ... that only a computer crunching the english language could solve...it was hard...ran a few on university server in pascal.  clues were sparse.
 JohnCM: escape room coding level is easy
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i'm completely mistaken. I hope so
 JohnCM: you just need to do some for loop, and it's done already
 ClockSort: i have some escaper-friends so we would love a team escape contest&#160;:)
 aangairbender: I enjoy solving past multiplayers as 'solo' contests
 eulerscheZahl: if they still do the coding contests and the other thing on top, i don't care
 JohnCM: but i think bot coding is like fundamentally different from escape room
 JohnCM: don't think it will clash
 ClockSort: bot coding is different from a lot of things
 ClockSort: i do competitive programming on codeforces.com and it's totally different from that
 eulerscheZahl: like tech.io. the concept isn't even bad. but they failed to move their CG community over to the other platform. points of interest are too different
 eulerscheZahl: i suck on codeforces
 ZarthaxX: same
 struct: I opened a puzzle and then deleted
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: candidate master eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: your obsession with deleting is impressive
 eulerscheZahl: a purple peasant
 ZarthaxX: thats good eulerscheZahl
 ZarthaxX: are you kidding lol
 struct: 3 hours until delete&#160;:'(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did THE Toad do HashCode this year?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, but my good rank is all thanks to Neumann in my team
 struct: that is what top&#160;%?
 eulerscheZahl: team DEIN, rank 78 i think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: NICE
 eulerscheZahl: again, not my achievement
 ZarthaxX: nice one toad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: does CG re-run everyone or just legend?
 eulerscheZahl: top100
 ZarthaxX: top 100 legend
 ZarthaxX: aaaaaaaaah
 ZarthaxX: but they start from actual position
 eulerscheZahl: min(100, legendSize) to be precise
 eulerscheZahl: but legend is huge, so...
 ZarthaxX: isnt it a bit like boring tho
 ZarthaxX: as everyone starts from actual rank
 eulerscheZahl: I think i'm done writing my ante mortem
 ZarthaxX: you already know the results
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Maybe i'll get my DFS to work on the game after the contest
 ZarthaxX: why not BEFORE patrick
 struct: wow massive improvements
 struct: i finally found it
 Westicles: What are the odds a new #1 shows up?  1/12?
 eulerscheZahl: less
 ZarthaxX: 0
 ClockSort: @struct what did you find?
 ZarthaxX: struct?????????
 ZarthaxX: PM ME THAT NOW
 struct: 52% vs 48%  massive
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My brain is shot, too much physical labor lately.
 ZarthaxX: ...
 struct: MassiVE
 eulerscheZahl: but only submits at 65%
 struct: renting aws machine was waste of money
 struct: lol
 ClockSort: :question_mark:
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl if u have many CG T shirts feel free to give my address this time :P
 eulerscheZahl: but having it isn't the same as winning it
 eulerscheZahl: it won't make you happy
 JohnCM: we should have a newbie shirt, for best 10 newbies who don't already have a cg shirt
 struct: ok im not gonna give up yet
 ZarthaxX: still owe you one, need to hit that top 20 some day
 JohnCM: XD
 ClockSort: what are you talking about
 struct: We should have a shirt for testers
 struct:  /s
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: struct shouldnt you be sleeping rn?
 struct: its only 6 am
 ZarthaxX: only
 ZarthaxX: :D
 ZarthaxX: gonna stay until 9?
 LLG: seems like I'm not hitting legend this contest as well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if I ever run into you guys at a comicon or some crap and i see a CG t-shirt...Imma rob you
 LLG: capped out at 40 gold, anything I do make it worse
 ZarthaxX: LLG try winning
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 LLG: still an improvement from 400ish gold last contest
 LLG: I'm trying ZarthaxX
 LLG: my bot doesn't want to cooperate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: who taught ZarthaxX??? he went from zero to hero in like a year
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hehehehe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry
 ClockSort: legend is tough, don't feel bad @LLG
 ClockSort: the gold boss is obnoxious to get past, too
 ZarthaxX: LLG same, hate my bot
 JohnCM: that gold boss...
 ZarthaxX: try resubmitting tho&#160;:)
 ClockSort: haha
 JohnCM: i dunno what i need to do to win it
 ClockSort: i
 ZarthaxX: PatrickMcGinnisII what haha, a year? more like couple years :D
 LLG: I had a bot that wins against the gold boss 7/10 times
 LLG: but it somehow never made it near the boss
 ClockSort: i'm #19 legend, a chance for a prize :sweat_smile:
 JohnCM: overfitting then
 LLG: probably a rock-paper-scissors thing
 ClockSort: @LLG that was happening to me too! play against the #2 guy behind the boss and he seems stronger
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to discourage you ClockSort. but some are in submit, you'll always drop a bit. will be a close call
 ZarthaxX: i was gonna say that toad
 JohnCM: actually a lot of ppl are very strong in the top 100 gold league, they just haven't passed the gold boss yet
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: no way that ill resubmit unless 65
 JohnCM: euler, how was code jam this year?
 struct: against all my other versions
 eulerscheZahl: :sob:
 eulerscheZahl: 1194th, needed 1000
 LLG: yeah I realized that too JohnCM
 LLG: every fight in top 100 gold right now feels like a map RNG for me
 eulerscheZahl: and short after the contest i got the idea how to solve a problem
 LLG: I could technically win against any bot in top 100 if I get a map my bot is good on
 JohnCM: man, better luck next year then euler. i'm probably joining next year too
 JohnCM: now that i know how to code in c++
 eulerscheZahl: codejam works with pretty much any language
 ZarthaxX: you need to learn how to do it fast tho
 ZarthaxX: true
 LLG: I told myself after last contest I'd do c++ for this one
 LLG: I ended up doing c# anyway
 eulerscheZahl: for CG C++ is more important
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: I did the last in C++ and switched back to C# for this one
 struct: I use c++ as a wraper to not get bullied
 eulerscheZahl: only to deny Zenoscave's language achievement
 struct: I use D
 LLG: you're good with your D huh

 eulerscheZahl: 2am, isn't it?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you know, if a couple of us actually sat down and had some BBQ in RL, we'd prolly be Billionaires

 Bernard_Lowe: @Clocksort GL winning the fabled T-shirts lol.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap 1am... I gotta throw 10 gallons of paint tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the whale promoted
 eulerscheZahl: did you change profession PatrickMcGinnisII?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah, remodelling a rental house...so i can sell it...market is ripe for selling my rentals
 Westicles: exciting race on for tops in objC
 pmor: central florida housing market is insane right now.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i do like 3 different things for income...laser products, landlord, web, -- mainly.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh where u at pmor?
 pmor: winter garden
 Nero39: lca
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i know orlando a little bit
 eulerscheZahl: PatrickMcGinnisII selling the house to pmor?
 pmor: ha!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i got offers already and its not on the market yet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crazy stuff
 pmor: house next to mine was on the market for 3 days
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have had this house for like 6 years, put in like 65k...gonna sell it for 165k...crazy profit
 pmor: that's cheap compared to here.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I started seeding the lawn, people kept stopping and bugging me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: buyers are hungry
 Bernard_Lowe: @pmor can confirm, from Orlando as well. I'll never get a house.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, winter garden is more expensive
 pmor: Family member just built a house.  They had offers over 150k than they payed to resell it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't live in a 150k house tho...pfft
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i bought a property unseen in colorado...sold it a week later for +10k
 PatrickMcGinnisII: people r so wierd
 Westicles: He says lasers and houses and people want to talk about houses
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll talk about anything, idc
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm excited someone on CG is in FL
 cegprakash: interesting seed to test: seed=5610932785868666900
 Westicles: Kids don't get excited about lasers and nuclear war like we did back in the day

 struct: the cost
 struct: 6.27 EUR
 eulerscheZahl: and that as someone who plays out of competition
 cegprakash: my bot is in a rank that my bot can never reach if I resubmit ;P
 cegprakash: anyone else feel the same? :P
 ClockSort: @cegprakash same
 Bernard_Lowe: Yep. The competition gets harder to climb each time.
 dGrayCoder: I wish this competition was a bit longer D: 
 ClockSort: just hold still for 2 hrs 38 min.
 ClockSort: @dGrayCoder 11 days not enough? :O
 ClockSort: i'm fried, would prefer 7 days contest
 Bernard_Lowe: you and/or delineate need to win a T-shirt. Make us americans feel good&#160;:)
 dGrayCoder: Next game comes after half a year
 PatrickMcGinnisII: as long as someone is kicking Miyaza's butt
 Bernard_Lowe: 11 days for a competition is a long time. I felt burnout after 8 days.
 eulerscheZahl: dGrayCoder we don't know yet.will be announced right after this contest ends
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ClockSort can't do a NN in 7 days me thinks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok i lost 90 ranks on last submit, throwing in the towel
 ClockSort: @Bernard_Lowe my chance of top-20 is about 15% I think
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i thought top 3 was the real goal
 eulerscheZahl: i liked the shorter contests. in the past they started on Friday and ended on Saturday, leading to a total of 8 days
 Bernard_Lowe: Why do you think your chances are so low?
 ClockSort: because there are many smart people on earth
 eulerscheZahl: and some of them are in submit
 struct: so many smart and im not one of them
 Bernard_Lowe: lol. Everyone at the top is submitting and adjusting every 10 minutes.
 ClockSort: that's it for me. good night all! ggs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've lost more brain cells than alot of Normies even have to rub together
 eulerscheZahl: see you

 eulerscheZahl: you'll wake up a few times and check the leaderboard ClockSort
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall be good, and if you can't be good - be good at it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll celebrate top 1k tomorrow
 1XC: I hate fast mode and I always get it

 Anzc: hello
 dGrayCoder: can max number of days be different for every match?
 pmor: no
 cegprakash: for those who are not in gold yet quick tip: sort all possible moves by target index if they are same sort by  source index and print the first valid move&#160;:)
 LLG: quick tip: code a bot
 struct: getting frustrated&#160;:(
 nam4.nguyen: wow I got top 180 in gold league after modifying a bit
 nam4.nguyen: that's amazing cause just a little change can improve that much
 cegprakash: what did u change nam4.nguyen
 nam4.nguyen: Just seed when there's no seed already
 nam4.nguyen: and keep s3 = 4 for almost time
 cegprakash: I thought 5 is ideal
 cegprakash: anyway I think it depends on other parts of the code :P
 cegprakash: let me watch a replay with u
 cegprakash: I'm in the same range
 nam4.nguyen: yeah there's so many params to do with
 LLG: I did a singular change and it bumped my bot from 200 gold top 50 gold
 LLG: what I did was load an old submit and resubmit it&#160;:^
 LLG: to 50*
 nam4.nguyen: it's true
 cegprakash: LLG what did u change :o
 nam4.nguyen: my old one got more point than new one
 LLG: cegprakash like I said, just load an old submit lol
 cegprakash: lol
 LLG: basically I load the bot that doesn't look ahead 1 turn to check for optimal seed placement
 cegprakash: so u have time traveled
 LLG: it just maximize seed placement for the current turn
 LLG: and uhhh it also didn't look at sequence of grow moves to evaluate
 LLG: just evaluate each move separately
 LLG: and it performed better
 nam4.nguyen: I didn't even consider about sun direction and shadow
 nam4.nguyen: that's why I doubt about my rank
 cegprakash: Jon Arryn in Game of Thrones said "The seed is strong" before he died. True indeed.. Seed decides who wins
 eulerscheZahl: Pick8chu 07:30AMeulerscheZahl dang you got on 7
 struct: Why do I still stay awake
 struct: during final hours..
 cegprakash: struct coz u believe in one magic number chaging ranks :P
 cegprakash: like me
 struct: one number wont do much
 struct: I ran fiddler for 300k games
 struct: didnt work
 cegprakash: fiddler against urself?
 LLG: nam4.nguyen I never considered sun and shadow either
 struct: yes
 cegprakash: against urself don't matter at all
 LLG: I just make sure my bot doesn't plant trees that cuck themselves
 struct: my current bot was only improved by fighting other versions of itself
 struct: ofc it matters
 MSmits: morning guys
 struct: I dont think I ever tested against a player in the ide
 cegprakash: buggy bots can perform better in most maps :P
 struct: hi MSmits
 struct: no bugs here
 cegprakash: no bugs? literally no one ever
 MSmits: I promised to share some sim stuff about this game, but gonna wait a bit to see if others will in their PM. Otherwise I don't have too much to add
 MSmits: expecting to see plenty of PMs
 eulerscheZahl: mine omits bit boards and such, struct can do that better
 eulerscheZahl: chat is getting laggy agin
 struct: im sure plenty of people did the same type I did
 UndercoverToad: this is better
 eulerscheZahl: my post mortem is long enough without
 UndercoverToad: wrong chat
 struct: But I did it first cant deny it
 struct: I did it on day 2 or 3 of testing
 Butanium: I have 2 hours of english class to finish my MCTS lol
 MSmits: btw, in the end I think the legend boss was not too bad. They could have made it slightly stronger, but I had a hard time beating it and legend did not reach 300
 Butanium: it's going to be hard
 MSmits: gold boss i mean
 MSmits: these contests are just getting really big
 UndercoverToad: you already speak English, you don't need that class
 struct: 1:50
 LLG: I speak english as a foreign language, still didn't need english class
 struct: its almost over
 LLG: internet taught me more than any teacher ever did
 Kret111kret: glomm
 dGrayCoder: how are some players able make their npc say words?
 struct: seed 10 9 message
 dGrayCoder: message function?
 LLG: just a string
 LLG: basically anything after your actual command gets printed as a message
 struct: seed 10 9 anything you want
 LLG: COMPLETE 3 Never gonna give you up
 ddreams: Illedan gratulerer med dagen&#160;:) 
 ddreams: you haven't given up
 struct: if I get &lt;= 50 im happy
 struct: its a decent result for 20+ days contest
 ddreams: I'm really surprised that none of the changes I tried improved it... need to find a way to visualize the beam search
 struct: I tried visualizing it
 ddreams: must be buggy somehow
 struct: I printed it to text file
 struct: but good luck
 ddreams: mm.. big data
 cegprakash: submits stuck oh god
 UndercoverToad: no, leaderboard is still moving
 UndercoverToad: just &gt; 300 submitting again
 Pick8chu: dang..
 TootiFlooti: they extended deadline??
 Pick8chu: sad that i won't be able to get in legend league
 Pick8chu: idon't think so they did?
 UndercoverToad: no, it ends in 1.5h as planned all the time
 TootiFlooti: idk I remember i checked last night and it was supposed to end at 8PM pacific time.
 TootiFlooti: oh then i just saw the wrong time
 TootiFlooti: Will this software be available for practice after the challenge. I dont think i can get past gold tonight but i would like to continue working on it tomorrow
 UndercoverToad: you can keep playing the game
 UndercoverToad: will be unavailable for a bit. sometimes it comes back the same day, sometimes you have to wait 1 or 2 days
 UndercoverToad: you will also keep your position on the leaderboard and all the submit history
 Bax533: What happens if my submit won't finish fighting before deadline? Will it still count if i submit before deadline?
 TootiFlooti: dope!! This is the first time I  tried a challenge a friend of my introduced me to it and I have had a lot of fun so I look forward to more challenges in the future
 UndercoverToad: all submits will finish. that includes league promotions
 UndercoverToad: then top100 will face a rerun to reduce ranking randomness
 Pick8chu: Hey UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: hi
 Pick8chu: you got on top 7
 Bax533: Great thanks
 Pick8chu: nice job man
 UndercoverToad: there are still some stronger players in submit
 UndercoverToad: i'm happy if i can stay in top10 but it's really close
 Pick8chu: aha
 Pick8chu: dang..it's just crazy that you made it that far
 UndercoverToad: but thanks, i'm satisfied with my result overall
 Pick8chu: So you used best first search?
 UndercoverToad: beam search
 UndercoverToad: i made some writeup already, will post after the end
 LLG: looking forward to that
 Pick8chu: Oh that'd be awesome
 LLG: couldn't get my beam search going so I went with a pure heuristics approach
 Pick8chu: I really wanted to learn how you did it haha thanks
 UndercoverToad: you will be disappointed by how little i have inside my bot
 struct:&#160;:/
 struct: I also have little I guess
 Pick8chu: I'm excited
 TootiFlooti: the top scorers all are using c++ and C#
 TootiFlooti: what are you all using 
 struct: im using chokudai
 UndercoverToad: for this game it's a crucial to get several thousand actions simulated. that makes it hard for python at the top
 Pick8chu: I'm using C++ but i'm not even legend
 struct: Its beam search but it expands beam width
 UndercoverToad: didn't try for this contest. but Neumann says he got pretty much the same result with beam and chokudai
 struct: yeah
 struct: no gain
 UndercoverToad: but no loss either
 Pick8chu: is chokudai algorithm too?
 Pick8chu: haven't heard of it
 Pick8chu: can't find anything on google
 UndercoverToad: not that commonly known, named after a user with that name
 Pick8chu: Ohh..
 UndercoverToad: the idea is to have a fixed search depth. you start expanding in a best-first manner
 UndercoverToad: then you go back to the start and expand the 2nd best
 UndercoverToad: and keep going to make the search wider while keeping the same depth
 UndercoverToad: until you run out of time
 Pick8chu: I see
 UndercoverToad: no witchcraft involved
 Pick8chu: what's the differences with beam? it has unlimited dept?
 Pick8chu: *depth
 struct: but not width
 UndercoverToad: chokudai = fixed depth, dynamic widthbeam = fixed width, dynamic depth
 Pick8chu: Oh...I se
 Pick8chu: e
 UndercoverToad: and both lack opponent handling, better suited for a single player optimization problem
 struct: ok I give up
 struct: its time
 Pick8chu: lol
 Pick8chu: you did great tho
 Pick8chu: top 30 aren't you?
 struct: no
 struct: top 50
 struct: for now
 Pick8chu: impressive enough
 Pick8chu: I'm top 700 or something lo
 Pick8chu: gg
 dbdr: Illedan spam submitting magic constants?&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: the classic Illedan
 UndercoverToad: who hasn't seen him doing this?
 ddreams: autosubmitter
 UndercoverToad: no, he does that manually
 ddreams: parameterfiddler with autosubmit, clearly
 UndercoverToad: even managed to play &gt; 1000 games in IDE last contest. by hand
 struct: MSmits does that on his sleep for yavalath
 UndercoverToad: cat woke me up at night and wanted something. My first thought was like "i'll let the search finish first, maybe she's still sleeping at higher depth"
 dbdr: noobs, seeing it for the first time&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: i wish I was kidding
 struct: lol
 ddreams: the tetris effect
 solistice: hmm, should I try to go for legend? :D
 solistice: 1hr to go
 solistice:&#160;:') 
 UndercoverToad: "legend or delete" is a popular game here
 dbdr: you need to give your account password to Blaise, he does the deleting
 struct: I feel like I missed something obvious on eval
 UndercoverToad: do you have suns? :P
 dbdr: not sure anything is obvious in eval&#160;:)
 dbdr: I considered counting suns negatively&#160;;)
 struct: o.o
 UndercoverToad: because you didn't spend them?
 dbdr: yeah
 UndercoverToad: i have a factor &gt; 1/3 for suns
 Pick8chu: lmao legend or delete
 UndercoverToad: this is struct's 3rd account
 Pick8chu: LMAO
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: thoughts on the game?
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/yavalath">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/yavalath</a>Yavalath - by an anonymous CodinGamer
 UndercoverToad: that's from struct
 struct: actually i dont have suns on eval
 struct: o.o
 ThunderbirdOne: Toady!
 UndercoverToad: i hated the game on the first weekend already
 UndercoverToad: wow ThunderbirdOne, haven't seen you for at least a decade
 ThunderbirdOne: haha, sure feels like it
 UndercoverToad: or so it feels
 UndercoverToad: :D
 ThunderbirdOne: saw someone stream the comp last night
 ThunderbirdOne: and i was like 'oooooh shit'
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: It seems like success is just found by making random changes to the eval or heuristics
 ThunderbirdOne: so i spent 2 hours getting to bronze&#160;:')
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: imo
 UndercoverToad: you are in the upper 90% then, congrats
 ThunderbirdOne: it's something
 ThunderbirdOne: haven't implemented a seed method
 ThunderbirdOne: but eh, then i'd  have to implement some distance thing with hex
 ThunderbirdOne: no thanks
 ThunderbirdOne: not in the final hour
 UndercoverToad: took me a bit of time as well to set it up properly
 UndercoverToad: so the early lead went to dbdr this contest
 ThunderbirdOne: also have a digital conference today and tomorow
 struct: good thing it fitted on an uint64_t
 UndercoverToad: i used a signed one
 dbdr: at least I had those days of lead. two episodes&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: wasn't sure how x &amp; -x would work with unsigned
 Marchete: signed? madness
 UndercoverToad: and casting to ulong for popcount
 UndercoverToad: no Marchete facepalms
 UndercoverToad: now*
 Marchete: x ^ y is faster than x &amp; ~y  ? I use the former
 UndercoverToad: no idea. I also use the xor
 UndercoverToad: note that I wrote x &amp; -x
 UndercoverToad: minus, not tilde
 UndercoverToad: and x, not y
 UndercoverToad: to get the last set bit
 UndercoverToad: as a bitmask
 Marchete: 1UL &lt;&lt; 63?
 dbdr: UndercoverToad, do you have the link at hand for that SDK change to increase the timeout?
 Marchete: anyways signed and bit operations can be deadly
 UndercoverToad: probably here dbdr <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/counterbalance">https://github.com/counterbalance</a>
 Marchete: reCurs_e said what he was using?
 UndercoverToad: no
 Marchete: I'd bet for either NN with only value output
 Marchete: or any kind of UCT forest
 dbdr: I see referees there. I mean remove the 30s constraint
 UndercoverToad: i know. counterbalance did that
 UndercoverToad: i can link you my contribution where i also removed the 30s
 struct: I think he means your demo euler

 UndercoverToad: we did it in a different manner
 dbdr: thanks!
 dbdr: I suppose you do it without modifzing the engine, if it's uploaded on CG?
 jrke: i think reCurse's lead will increase a lot in final re run
 solistice: when can we expect reCurse's PM?
 Marchete: I hope so!
 UndercoverToad: i replaced parts of the engine by my own and modified the maven import
 Marchete: he plays so differently
 UndercoverToad: my time limit is set to 60s but can be completely removed of course
 struct: well its over for me
 struct: im going to rest now
 struct: cya later
 UndercoverToad: bye
 derjack: so we can exploit cg server even more? :imp:
 UndercoverToad: i shared my thoughts on discord and julien read about it&#160;:(
 dbdr: src/main/java/com/codingame/gameengine/core/GameManager.java:    private static final int GAME_DURATION_HARD_QUOTA = 60_000;got it&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: make it larger. make it a long
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: and set to the heat death time of the universe, just to be sure
 cegprakash: I finally have a bot which can beat gold boss 50% of the times
 cegprakash: but I need to get to him :P
 Ajaiy2: I guess I am finally ending in Silver, but this is the first time I cam this far
 Ajaiy2: *came
 cegprakash: Ajaiy2 do u sort by treeIndex and seedIndex?
 Ajaiy2: Sort for what?
 Soumyadarshan: i want the solution of clash of codes
 cegprakash: sort all valid moves by seedIndex.. if equal tree index and process them 1 by 1 and choose the first best move
 cegprakash: Ajay that gets to gold
 Soumyadarshan: its very confucing code with integers
 Ajaiy2: What's the question?
 lionandmouse: First time for me in Silver as well. Simple Action scoring function developed with genetic evolution. Didn't expect it to work so well.
 Westicles: I am impressed with cegs gibberish suggestions
 Soumyadarshan: The game mode is REVERSE: You do not have access to the statement. You have to guess what to do by observing the following set of tests: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba2ddd97-afc9-43cc-a885-06cf078c9057">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba2ddd97-afc9-43cc-a885-06cf078c9057</a>

 dbdr: and I won't send it
 Marchete: 55% is too little diff, can be noise, no?
 UndercoverToad: i still don't know how to read this grid. I stick to the numbers in the line above
 UndercoverToad: how many games?
 dbdr: 200 games
 Marchete: I hade some bash for calculating it
 Marchete: had*
 UndercoverToad: that's too few
 dbdr: 55/43.5, there are some draws
 Marchete: p1W/(p1W+p2W)
 dbdr: I don't think it's noise, but it could be overfit
 Marchete: last minute submits are risky
 dbdr: indeed, that's why
 delineate: 200 games is nothing in my opinion. so many times I've had a good start after 500 games but since it been worse or breakeven after more
 Marchete: statistically speaking you are right
 dbdr: yeah, that's 55.8% marchete
 dbdr: delineate you do swap positions?
 dbdr: sorry, it means 400 considering swaps. 200 pairs of matches
 delineate: yes, I do play both sides, that helps a lot
 delineate: ah okay
 dbdr: 200 is the param to brutal&#160;:)
 delineate: that's not bad then, especially with that&#160;%
 Marchete: all sample size calculators set 385 as a good sample for infinite population 5% margin error
 dbdr: and yes, more is better, it just takes time. esp with 100ms timeout
 UndercoverToad: does the swap still work? i thought -s is server mode (viewable replay) now?
 Marchete: p1 is always at left side or it's random?
 dbdr: that's the referee argument -s
 UndercoverToad: so you have a fixed list of seeds instead?
 UndercoverToad: oh, wait
 UndercoverToad: got it
 UndercoverToad: referee -s and brutaltester -s
 dbdr: no, same random seed twice
 dbdr: yeah
 Marchete: referee have that prepared?
 Marchete: I remember tweaking something about -s long time ago
 dbdr: no, brutal calls referee twice
 UndercoverToad: it was me who added -s to the brutaltester and made a PR, yet I got confused :D
 dbdr: lol
 tobk: 30 minutes left. Time for a last panic submit!&#160;:-)
 Marchete: yeah I remember some PR about that
 aCat: woriking on it tobk
 dbdr: Illedan at 0% as usual :D
 UndercoverToad: when you are at the bottom, you have nothing to lose on a last minute submit

 struct: why did i terminate the machine
 struct: WHY
 UndercoverToad: you need more games
 struct: YES but i closed the aws machine
 struct: fck me
 Marchete: aws machine?
 Marchete: you guys are pros :D
 struct: yes i rented
 UndercoverToad: now you don't even know the params you tested?
 struct: for 12 hours
 Marchete: I rented some for NS too :D
 dbdr: wow
 UndercoverToad: is it still in the s3 bucket? or just in the EC2 which is gone now?
 jrke: i just noticed that battles in gold are faster than legend
 UndercoverToad: a very cheap rental :rofl:
 dbdr: nice stats struct! you lost the code? :O
 Marchete: use spot machines
 Marchete: much cheaper
 struct: it probably was luck
 struct: not enough games&#160;:(
 Marchete: also in Azure, batch jobs  were really cool
 struct: what is spot machines Marchete?
 UndercoverToad: Neumann coming

 Marchete: sorry
 UndercoverToad: is that the server auction thing?
 Marchete: they are VM without any guarantees
 Marchete: they can shut them down at any time
 Marchete: but you save up to 90%
 Marchete: Gcloud as them too

 UndercoverToad: evil Neumann
 jfaixo: you may have EBS snapshots, even if you terminated the EC2, check it&#160;;)
 UndercoverToad: oh no, looks like i won't win Germany&#160;:(
 Marchete: poor Illeda_n , he won't sleep anymore
 cegprakash: bot with better win rate not climbing rank
 cegprakash: so I guess settle with older bot
 jrke: bye i am not gonna make anymore submits&#160;:(
 dbdr: bye jrke
 jrke: and grats reCurse on winning contest
 Marchete: we must wait the legend recalc (/s this time)
 azriel1rf: Might it demote (such as legend -&gt; gold) at the system test (judge after contest)?
 Marchete:&#160;?? only top100 legend recalcs
 azriel1rf: ah, ok
 Marchete: and they usually don't disqualify
 azriel1rf: thanks
 CouscousAgha: what's the gold boss rank?

 Marchete: I need PM to read!

 UndercoverToad: already there with contest still going?
 UndercoverToad: that's weird
 UndercoverToad: i'll wait with posting
 Pick8chu: what's PM?
 Pick8chu: what's PM?
 UndercoverToad: no details about fall challenge yet
 cegprakash: no Pick8chu
 cegprakash: 3*2 + 1
 UndercoverToad: PM = post mortem
 UndercoverToad: strategy writeup
 Westicles: is that generic artwork?
 Pick8chu: I see
 CouscousAgha: can anyone tell me the score of gold boss?
 Pick8chu: Oh I was looking at blue, thanks guys&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: yes, always the same cover art
 struct: ok i go to sleep now
 struct: ill read pms when I wake up
 struct: I hope I get 50th
 mybk: 46.55
 mybk: MiyazaBoss score
 Marchete: don't you sleep that night?
 struct: i didnt sleep no
 Marchete: some of you submitted really early, or late
 struct: i didnt sleep and didnt submit ...
 Marchete: ....
 struct: no improvements at all
 Marchete: then?
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: ok I get it
 Marchete: nah, I just failed miserably with eval
 Marchete: and dropped it
 Marchete: I think I have the right idea
 Marchete: but somehow it doesn't normalize or whatever
 UndercoverToad: and of course Magus will be the first with his post mortem again
 Magus: My PM are most of the time simplier than others :p
 UndercoverToad: mine is ready. but i wait till 10am
 UndercoverToad: no spoilers
 Marchete: lol
 Marchete: in 10min to recode test and submit
 aCat: yeou should write code not postmortem euler ;p
 Noyotens: is 7:28 in mine
 Marchete: german people is german
 UndercoverToad: i give a short code snippet on beam as that was asked several times on chat
 Magus: UndercoverToad: I'm  writing it directly on the forum. It will not be finished before 10am, don't worry.
 Marchete: I pruned a lot, and I think it makes sense
 Marchete: like not complete moves before X turn
 UndercoverToad: not if i can successfully distract you
 Marchete: if before X turn all seed are priorized to a tree3
 Marchete: and only 1 tree3
 Marchete: etc
 BoBot: lol, managed to write in a new language (Scala) without NPEs or needing nullable values till the...last 20 minutes of the contest...
 DaNinja: 5 mins, enough to work on a legend bot!
 cegprakash: going with a risky last minute submission 
 cegprakash: lets see :P
 Marchete: 5 min
 cegprakash: 1 loss in first 11 games
 VizGhar: wow didnt look for about 2 days and i dropped like 300 places :D
 UndercoverToad: you wasted your weekend
 cegprakash: VizGhar u can still improve in multi
 DaNinja: 175 computing in gold 
 cegprakash: multi's open pretty quick
 Marchete: wow, that's a big strecth
 Marchete: weekend with family, sun and going out it's ok too
 UndercoverToad: i'm trolling
 Marchete: me too
 UndercoverToad: :rofl:
 cegprakash: 225 legends is just too many legends :P 
 JohnCM: haha i just resubmitted
 Whatar: gg
 Marchete: yeah, too big legend this time
 cegprakash: last 2 mins!!
 BoBot: oh well, my last hour shadow code had some bug somewhere, the last submit shouldnt matter..
 cegprakash: last min submitters go fast :D last 2 mins
 peerdb: yep im hitting test in arena
 Tiramon: stoped completing 0 score trees this morning improved my rank by 400&#160;;)
 Marchete: save any code before they close the IDE
 JohnCM: i just hit test in arena without even checking my code lol
 JohnCM: ran out of attempts
 UndercoverToad: try not to complete size 1 next
 UndercoverToad: oh, score 0, my bad
 UndercoverToad: still, score 1 is bad too
 UndercoverToad: 4 suns = 1.33 points
 JohnCM: gg
 UndercoverToad: 10s
 Dr-D: That IS a useful check I never though about =D
 Tiramon: yes only completing score &gt; 1
 Marchete: ok 10:00 german time right now
 Marchete: lol euler :rofl:
 Marchete: come on
 UndercoverToad: posted PM before magus for the first time :trophy:
 aCat: the closed my IDE&#160;:(
 Marchete: 0.01ms after it's 10:00am
 aCat: got error :crying_cat_face:
 Magus: UndercoverToad: you are euler :D
 VizGhar: It's done, it's over
 Astrobytes: well done all
 JohnCM: wow recurse's lead is amazing
 UndercoverToad: yes magus, chat got laggy under my main account
 VectorXz: I'm on battle progress, will it continue to calculating final score?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: even promotions will finish

 UndercoverToad: 473 computing, will take a while
 JohnCM: thanks for the fun times everyone! see you all next challenge
 TobiasA: wait it's over?
 Marchete: your scoring seems pretty simple euler
 TobiasA: bruh 
 TobiasA: who won
 Whiskee: I was thinking, the last contest had 50m turns instead of 100 (and FAR fewer turns iirc)
 UndercoverToad: it is. disappointingly simplecomplicated didn't work for me
 TobiasA: where is my prize
 Whiskee: no surprise it's grinding to a halt with everyone submitting at the last second
 Zandy156: same toad
 Marchete: don't you have cost related scoring, euler?
 UndercoverToad: i have suns
 CouscousAgha: is it gonna take a long time?
 UndercoverToad: maybe 1h to finish pending submits
 UndercoverToad: then 3-4h for the final recalc
 Marchete: sun as suncount or sungained?
 UndercoverToad: current suns
 Noyotens: #reCurse working in Ubisoft
 Noyotens:&#160;??!
 Tiramon: why not?
 VizGhar: he can work anywhere he wants with such a bot
 UndercoverToad: someone has to work for unisoft. or they run out of business quickly
 cegprakash: I got 34 points in gold.. does that mean I'm rank 4 if I were in legend :P 
 Marchete: hmm Magu_s is sequential MCTS, why not simulating at even depth?
 B4tiste: Is the site laggy for y'all too&#160;?
 Whatar: yes my friend 
 dGrayCoder: When is the fall?
 Dr-D: At least for me: yes
 Noyotens: yes network status 504
 UndercoverToad: far-fetched ceg :D
 UndercoverToad: that's normal in the minutes after the contest ended
 Tiramon: no cegprakash
 Marchete: damn, your evaluations seem so simple :unamused:
 Whiskee: yes, massive calculations in progress for end of the spring challenge (in case you were doing something else)&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: i had a more complicated one. then i deleted it as it wasn't working
 UndercoverToad: and the stupid opponent prediction did surprisingly well compared to what I had before
 Zandy156: I usually don't finish huge changes to my bot at the end. I don't know if I like this feeling of not knowing if its good enough or not.
 Magus: Marchete: I never tried to force only even (odd in my case) depths. So I can't say if it would be better :D
 rohrokz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1756337521c8ecd38b88b3f4f0e77711c411d71">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1756337521c8ecd38b88b3f4f0e77711c411d71</a>
 Magus: When I am at an even depth (so I have a selected action but not my opponent), I just use the rollout to select his action.
 UndercoverToad: oh, old CodinGame is back already
 Noyotens: CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2021\
 UndercoverToad: clashes
 Marchete: ok, but I always thought that sequential MCTS can be tweaked to only sim when both players have their moves in the gamestate
 aCat: :P
 maddenvvs: I want to thank CodinGame community and chat especially! You guys are very inspirational and I learned a lot from you! Thanks for the competition!
 RoboStac: but if it's doing full rollouts that doesn't really make any difference
 Noyotens: CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2021Guys see u later
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, how do you enforce the move constraints (Complete first, etc)? I look at the previous action of the day for that
 RoboStac: I guess it depends exactly what the sequential mcts does about conflicting moves (seeding same spot / taking same nutrient bonus) 
 Marchete: Magus, a question, how many rollouts in your MCTS?
 Marchete: per turn
 UndercoverToad: same dbdr. I also have an Expanded bitmask so I don't go back
 UndercoverToad: that is if i have 2 trees of same size, I do GROW 1 | GROW 2 but not vice versa
 cegprakash: my final eval look like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/18a800b4-cadd-4c7f-acd8-9cb972140dcc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/18a800b4-cadd-4c7f-acd8-9cb972140dcc</a>
 Marchete: grow1 | grow2 is filtered with hashing too
 Marchete: no?
 kovi: hash is not free here
 UndercoverToad: yes but still generates a state on the first hand
 UndercoverToad: ceg no opponent in your eval?
 kovi: i also prune early
 cegprakash: I use same function for opponent UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: you want to cast shadow on your opponent
 Marchete: ahh
 UndercoverToad: ah, ok
 Magus: Marchete: my IA output the number of expand/rollout at each turn (the first number)
 cegprakash: playerId = 1 means opponent  0 means myself
 Magus: the second number is the score of the node
 Magus: (the selected node)
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 cegprakash: UndercoverToad I reduce recovery of opponent
 cegprakash: meaning it takes care of shadowing
 cegprakash: I think
 Marchete: rollouts skyrocket at endgame :D
 Westicles: TestAccount11515 coming after you guys
 Donotalo: there is far less online contests in CG now&#160;:(
 Marchete: it seems nobody mirrors inital moves on the enemy
 Donotalo: now the date isn't defined for next contest&#160;:(
 Marchete: almost all players did the same at start (except Recurs_e)
 Zandy156: lol I think I know who's account that is
 Marchete: he seeded from tree1, had more than 1 seed on the game, planted seed next to trees at first turn
 Marchete: completely weird moves from "normal" evaluation point of view
 UndercoverToad: because he understood the game. or his NN did
 Marchete: I think so
 UndercoverToad: the rest of us is playing as mere mortals
 CouscousAgha: STOP THE COUNT
 Marchete: I got stats from some top players
 Marchete: most others had some kind of strategy
 Marchete: very similar replays
 Marchete: but not him
 UndercoverToad: and then there is the chaotic good
 Marchete: chaotic evil?
 Tiramon: do we have a confirmed NN in the contest?
 Marchete: I'd say either a super weird eval or NN
 dbdr: UndercoverToad, you wrote "finished around 15th"
 Marchete: moves aren't logical on short horizon
 RoboStac: I can confirm my bot is (though it looks like I'll only manage around top 30)
 Marchete: NN robo?
 UndercoverToad: when I wrote that, i was 10th with some others in submit
 RoboStac: yeah
 Marchete: congrats
 UndercoverToad: will update later dbdr
 kovi: :o
 Marchete: both policy and value?
 RoboStac: yeah, usual alphazero style stuff
 Marchete: policy seems hard to me
 Marchete: wow
 RoboStac: sequential mcts  based
 Marchete: 3000 inputs and 2000 outputs :D
 UndercoverToad: i'm impressed that you got it somehwat working robo
 Marchete: me too
 kovi: yeah, well done
 UndercoverToad: just someone else stealing you the show
 Marchete: convolutional RoboStac?
 RoboStac: nah, didn't seem like that would work here
 Marchete: why?
 cegprakash: sometimes I lose games coz of bad sunlight not because my bot is a noob
 RoboStac: position is too important
 Marchete: but you have rotations, that leads to the same state
 RoboStac: but rotations break under sun changes
 UndercoverToad: sun is a problem to all of us
 Marchete: I mean if you "rotate" the board to always be at left
 UndercoverToad: top left starting position has the advantage according to my observations
 ItsNotABug: makes sense. By the time the sun gets there unobstructed the trees are grown
 Marchete: how many inputs?
 RoboStac: 534
 Marchete: wow :D
 sprkrd: What are the input features (at a glance), may I ask?
 Marchete: I'd like to read a PM about all that, seems so interesting
 FAngelo94: Hi all, for Spring challenge 2021 finished about 1 hour ago is it possible to see the code of AI implemented by people? In particular by the firsts in the leaderboard
 Marchete: no
 UndercoverToad: i saw robo typing on the forum already
 UndercoverToad: don't distract him
 Marchete: the challenge will be a multi
 RoboStac: yeah, I'll do a pm rather than type it all in chat
 Marchete: thanks!
 sprkrd: nice
 derjack: one-hots encodings?
 RoboStac: mostly
 derjack: who taught you that monstroity
 Marchete: yeah, it seems board games goes better with one-hot
 RoboStac: score worked better as a value 
 Marchete: a tree2 isn't better than tree1
 Marchete: there isn't a gradient between them
 Marchete: I mean it seems that tree3 isnt 2*tree1 or 1*tree
 derjack: how many outputs in policy
 sprkrd: But I'm thinking cardinal inputs could work too
 Marchete: he'll write a PM
 sprkrd: Like, how many trees of size X in cells of type Y for player Z
 derjack: every input 'could work', but youll need much more hidden layers
 Marchete: in 100kb including bot code...
 sprkrd: Where the type of cell can be corner, edge, middle ring or center ring and dead center cell something like that
 Marchete: I don't know, this game seems positional
 sprkrd: There are other features that can take into account position
 sprkrd: like average sun income for 6 days if all trees are fully grown
 cegprakash: register for the next fall challenge&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I just registered
 derjack: what will be the theme of fall challenge?
 sprkrd: I tried to use that kind of numeric features without much success with linear regression, but maybe a larger, non-linear approximator could fare better
 Jokras: Is the next challenge also an AI challenge?
 derjack: all challenges are AI challenge
 Marchete: they used their NN bots (alphazero like) at another games
 Marchete: like oware
 Dr-D: And that is the beauty in it =)
 Marchete: one-hot encoding performed much better
 Marchete: and trained faster
 sprkrd: I'm always hesitant to go the NN route because I haven't found a good way to do that within 100KB of code
 Marchete: you can do some "tricks" to encode weights as unicode
 Marchete: and fit more weights
 Marchete: also quantization or float16
 sprkrd: (And deep down I want the humble linear approximator to topple the mighty NNs&#160;:) )
 Marchete: jace_k and robosta_c had great success with that
 Marchete: top1 in many multis
 sprkrd: Sure, I'd like to have a go on that some day
 sprkrd: Just haven't got the time
 Marchete: error 429 at forum...
 derjack: it works for meh
 Marchete: don't refresh then
 aCat: 85% and 60-40 wr
 aCat: :D
 aCat: #85 i meant
 Michael_Howard: 51% and 19% in gold
 Michael_Howard: pleasepleaseplease...
 Michael_Howard: #19th*
 Michael_Howard: Has anyone got Swift into Legend before?
 UndercoverToad: where did that testaccount go that was destroying silver?
 Zandy156: just started gold
 UndercoverToad: oh, just started, nvm
 UndercoverToad: was gone a a short time
 UndercoverToad: and starting with 11 wins in gold
 Zandy156: its only like a rank 40 gold 
 Astrobytes: testaccount? Hider?
 Zandy156: don't worry
 Astrobytes: oh
 UndercoverToad: we don't know
 ashiknur: can someone give me your code who coded with monte charlo tree search algorithmor any AI algorithm?
 UndercoverToad: no sharing of full code
 UndercoverToad: just ideas as on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/</a>
 derjack: oh agad had NN too
 UndercoverToad: that part doesn't surprise me at all
 derjack: but he somewhat failed
 UndercoverToad: let's see if he'll keep working on it in the multiplayer
 Astrobytes: I didn't even notice he was playing
 CouscousAgha: is there a way i can see my own source code?
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 UndercoverToad: "view report"
 UndercoverToad: you can see the full submit history later when the multiplayer opens
 cegprakash: after the contest results are published yes CouscousAgha
 CouscousAgha: thanks guys!
 UndercoverToad: i still have to fix my file bundler, has some encoding issues
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fb23aa15-af2b-456f-ae17-701be57bc531">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fb23aa15-af2b-456f-ae17-701be57bc531</a>
 UndercoverToad: but it compiles, shrugs
 cegprakash: it's actually visible now itself CouscousAgha
 cegprakash: in the link shared by UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: the 2nd using System line has an odd character before
 UndercoverToad: as i said, the most recent submit is visible. the full history isn't yet
 aangairbender: UndercoverToad you can try to use mine<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/aangairbender/cg-singlefile-bundler-csharp">https://github.com/aangairbender/cg-singlefile-bundler-csharp</a>
 UndercoverToad: oh, some real code. mine is like 10 lines of python
 Marchete: Ille bundler also worked fine, it keeps updating the file as you work
 UndercoverToad: i'm not convinced by that design, having a process running in the background
 UndercoverToad: just add it as a build event and run it when needed
 aangairbender: I uploaded it to GitHub 3 days ago, but the code is a year old, so I am not sure about it. Btw I am looking forward to make it super cool for everybody
 Magus: For CG I always work with a single file :D
 Magus: a bad habit I suppose
 aangairbender: Magus using multiple files + bundler can raise your efficiency
 ItsNotABug: lol, the feedback page gave a 429 stats - too many requests
 ItsNotABug: lol, the feedback page gave a 429 status - too many requests
 Marchete: I've read Agad_e PM, it seemed like I would do the NN, just eval because policy seems overly complicated
 solistice: where to find PMs?
 derjack: i never did policy, so :shrug:
 ItsNotABug: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/5">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/5</a>
 ItsNotABug: But its dead for me
 aangairbender: I didnt get very high with simple beam search, so I implemented mcts duct, it didn't work well either
 Tiramon: yes site has a bit high load right now, guess it will get worse when the legend recalc starts&#160;;)
 Marchete: I think DUCT and similar are hard to tune and make it work
 RoboStac: ok, posted far too much information on how I didn't get my nn to win
 CouscousAgha: 395 computing and going down 
 ItsNotABug: Surely legend recalc is easier as its only 100 compared to current 400?
 Marchete: your policy seems cool RoboStac, I neve thought about that way
 Marchete: never*
 aangairbender: maybe there was not enough iterations for duct showing good results
 UndercoverToad: Magus do you use git for your bots at least?
 aangairbender: I used same eval as in beam search
 Magus: Yes I use git
 UndercoverToad: something at least
 RoboStac: yeah, I spent a while trying to work out how to get the number of moves to a sensible value
 aangairbender: oh, I've read your PM, euler. My beam search code is exactly the same (but in rust)
 aangairbender: and pruning approach
 UndercoverToad: minus the timeout. i omitted that for brevity
 Marchete: it's really cool, I like it
 derjack: sequential mcts, so it is like paranoid minimax?
 RoboStac: yeah
 Marchete: Gamestate was only updated after both players had chosen a move
 RoboStac: the enemy is responding to the moves I made (even if they didn't see it on the gamestate)
 Marchete: ahh
 RoboStac: just due to how it works on a treesearch point of view
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/17564252ad8a76000ea17d6a45bd2897b6cdda4">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/17564252ad8a76000ea17d6a45bd2897b6cdda4</a>
 derjack: oO
 UndercoverToad: no
 Astrobytes: Post that in #clash channel Noyotens
 aangairbender: Magus why you think MCTS DUCT didnt work? not enough iterations?
 Magus: Less performances, yes
 Magus: (less rollouts, less expands)
 Magus: I think that with equal performances, DUCT is better.
 Magus: But I never found a way to make DUCT as fast as sequential MCTS
 aangairbender: mine does around 3k iterations on the 2nd input
 aangairbender: and sim alone can handle around 300k in 100ms
 aangairbender: 300k full roullouts to the end I mean
 Anhrc: elca
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/17564330bffb6d751a27d7b01452d9b63592400">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/17564330bffb6d751a27d7b01452d9b63592400</a>
 Noyotens: plz
 Marchete: 300k full rollouts is a lot
 Marchete: are you sure?
 aangairbender: let me test it once again
 pb4: RoboStac&#160;: what do you call "sequential MCTS"&#160;?
 Noyotens:&#160;;-;
 pb4: How does it handle for exemple two players completing "at the same time"
 RoboStac: basically just turn based mcts rather than trying to do anything about simultaeneous
 Noyotens: who's kick me
 RoboStac: thats where it gets awkward
 Astrobytes: Noyotens: me. Stop posting clash links here and post them in #clash channel.
 RoboStac: in training both would get full nutrients, but I found it better to disable that on my submitted bot
 Marchete: seed is the only problem, complete should work ok, is sim is done when both players chose moves
 Marchete: if*
 RoboStac: the issue was it would basically always just assume they would complete too if I did 
 RoboStac: to not lose out on nutrients
 Marchete: ahh
 pb4: ok
 Noyotens: Astrobytes ok i am sorry
 RoboStac: so I found it better to be slightly innaccurate in the sim for that
 Astrobytes: Noyotens: no problem
 VietAnhTong: when will the spring challenge be converted to bot programming?
 Astrobytes: Later today or tomorrow most likely.
 aangairbender: Marchete you were right, it was total simulations, not total rollouts
 aangairbender: btw my latest code does 3.6k sims, but my code 3 days ago was 300k
 aangairbender: (I added 2nd player handling to simulation for MCTS DUCT)
 aangairbender: its weird anyway, 100x slowdown
 Marchete: 300k rollouts, with about 30 moves per turn would be like 9M sims/turn
 Marchete: per rollout*
 AntiSquid: Are CG forums dying? "too many requests"
 RoboStac: yeah, I had to try a few times to get my edit to to work
 UndercoverToad: congrats on legend BorisZ
 BorisZ: UndercoverToad thx euler :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i think i can switch back now
 eulerscheZahl: hm, still laggy
 DomiKo: still too many?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/I67qrxb">https://imgur.com/a/I67qrxb</a>
 eulerscheZahl: getting better
 derjack: hint: if you ban all these people in the list youll get less laggy
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: and mod rights will be revoked for ultimate speedup
 eulerscheZahl: i think i can script that
 none_: so, where is my legendary achievement? I spent whole weekend in legendary league and still nothing... :D
 eulerscheZahl: wait a day or 2
 RoboStac: scores are still being calculated
 RoboStac: achievements / coding points will turn up at some point after that
 eulerscheZahl: achievements over night i think
 derjack: unless they are shadowed
 none_: I though so, but I was quite surprised that I've got XPs right away
 eulerscheZahl: for promotion? that's another topic
 derjack: hmm yinsh got 30+ players last week
 eulerscheZahl: was puzzle of the week
 eulerscheZahl: until contest started and no one cared
 kurnevsky: @Magus hi, what do you mean by tree reuse in your PM? Not very clear from the description&#160;:)
 RoboStac: between turns he keeps the tree from the previous turn and just changes the root to the new state
 RoboStac: (calculates what the enemy did so he can navigate his tree)
 Nerchio: is recalc happening or?
 eulerscheZahl: still waiting for it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 24 submits have to finish first
 eulerscheZahl: now it's 20
 kurnevsky: &gt; between turns he keeps the tree from the previous turn
 eulerscheZahl: it saves time
 eulerscheZahl: if you don't recompute it
 RoboStac: it makes your future turns more accurate as you already have stats on moves
 RoboStac: eg if you do 1000 simulations on turn 1 and 200 of them end up in turn 2 state you already have 200 simulations of data for turn 2
 Nerchio: so recurse has an NN going or?
 eulerscheZahl: and some nodes with valid actions generated depending on how you implement the tree
 kurnevsky: So it's like amaf/rave?
 RoboStac: no, it's dealing with real states
 RoboStac: you go into turn 2 and already have a mcts tree with 200 nodes in it (instead of starting from 0 nodes every turn)
 kurnevsky: Ah, now I got it, thanks.
 derjack: but is tree reuse worth it with so many actions here?
 putibuzu: This was fun, GG WP everyone!&#160;:) 
 RoboStac: no idea - I didn't bother (especially since I didn't generate all possible seed actions I decided not too)
 peerdb: gg's my push to legend fell short but it was a lot of fun
 peerdb: thanks for hosting
 BeardedJotunn:   {
 ItsNotABug: How did someone resubmit 5 mins ago in gold?
 RoboStac: promoted from silver
 Astrobytes: they most likely promoted
 therealbeef: in theory you can submit in wood 2 at 9:59 and go all the way to legend&#160;;)
 therealbeef: and have the love of everyone
 ItsNotABug: damn. came to watch recurse squash the other legends :P 
 Marchete: that's already done
 CouscousAgha: gonna happen again in few minutes
 Marchete: waste of cpu
 peerdb: cpu is free real estate
 CouscousAgha: :popcorn: waiting for re run
 Nerchio: so much processing is wasted on mining cryptocoins we might as well spend a few cycles on our fun right
 CouscousAgha: and NFTs
 Marchete: bad + bad isn't a good
 Nerchio: so in the end 230 ppl in legend
 Nerchio: quite a lot i guess
 Marchete: a lot
 Nerchio: but considering the amount of people in the competition maybe its not so bad
 peerdb: it mostly seems like gold is way bigger than last times or maybe my memory is faulty
 CouscousAgha: do we have data of how many participated now vs the previous event?
 Twelve0: yes&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS</a>

 darkhorse64: 7142 for this contest
 AntiSquid: i see 6867 
 darkhorse64: I summed the leagues
 Twelve0: you don't have to it's in details page 
 CouscousAgha: i think 7142 who registered 
 Twelve0: 16,882 registered 
 CouscousAgha: damn
 darkhorse64: calc is better 
 AntiSquid: maybe some alts were removed&#160;?
 CouscousAgha: anytime now...
 GreatTux: why is the gap between registered and participants so big?
 AntiSquid: i see daiver (euler's alter ego) is still there though
 KelvinAndHubbles: a lot of people registered, but not everyone remembered it started
 CouscousAgha: GreatTux my guess is many registered months ago and didnt participate 
 CouscousAgha: just like now you can register to the next one that will occur in fall
 Astrobytes: Also, people may not like the look/idea of the game so don't bother.
 Twelve0: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2021</a> you can register in the next challenge 
 peerdb: whooo Twelve0 i registered!
 AntiSquid: heh astro, damn right, was at first like "oh damn a hex game, but luckily i can port bits and pieces from my pengu bot" and thought i slap a sim on top and done, but then the eval wrecked it&#160;:/
 peerdb: btw Twelve0 why is 42 morocco (1337) so good? :cold_sweat:
 Twelve0: are we really&#160;?
 AntiSquid: the entire day - turn cycle with fog of war disguised as WAIT and the board game rules kinda ruined it 
 CouscousAgha: peerdb why not? :D
 peerdb: almost as good as Paris, and we are 9th (42 amsterdam) so yeah
 peerdb: CouscousAgha fair game, gg man, next time we try to beat you again (and fail again)
 Twelve0: aah you're from codam
 CouscousAgha: we believe in you peerdb
 Twelve0: how's life there peerdb
 peerdb: yep, life is a little bit lockdown-y still Twelve0, how about there?
 peerdb: at least my internship rn isnt remote
 Twelve0: it's getting better, still we can't study at night yet
 peerdb: yeah same here I guess. Our country is slow with vaccines tho so it will be at least till august like this
 CouscousAgha: peerdb good luck &lt;3
 peerdb: thanks CouscousAgha you too :heart_eyes:
 CouscousAgha: everyone waiting for the last gold player
 natofp: when will we get final standings?
 CouscousAgha: natofp the last submission is at 94%
 DomiKo: after recalc
 CouscousAgha: and then a rerun of top 100 in legend
 CouscousAgha: it's starting anytime now
 eulerscheZahl: submits finished
 eulerscheZahl: let the recalc start
 CouscousAgha: can we watch it&#160;?

 eulerscheZahl: just started
 Twelve0: ohh
 CouscousAgha: wait
 CouscousAgha: it's more than top 100?
 eulerscheZahl: they do whole legend?
 Twelve0: everyone in legend 
 Twelve0: cool
 eulerscheZahl: i'm equally surprised
 CouscousAgha: yeah
 peerdb: oh funky
 CouscousAgha: EVERYONE... GET IN HERE
 CouscousAgha: this is gonna get bloody
 peerdb: more chance for 1337 to beat 42
 peerdb: lets get those baguettes
 CouscousAgha: peerdb i doubt it
 Twelve0: hahahahahaha
 Twelve0: nah ir's hard 
 CouscousAgha: but thanks for the support x)
 peerdb: haha np
 codingWhale: This reCurse guy seems to have a lucky streak :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 AntiSquid: ya just pure luck 
 Twelve0: hhhhhhhhhhhhh
 CouscousAgha: LMAO
 eulerscheZahl: ping nmahoude
 eulerscheZahl: "performance wise, I have around 40k actions in 50ms"
 AntiSquid: ouch
 natofp: how many games are going to happen per player?
 eulerscheZahl: about 1000
 eulerscheZahl: but don't trust me, i also announced a recalc for top100 only
 nam4.nguyen: So recal only for legend league?
 CouscousAgha: yes
 nam4.nguyen: oh so if I was out of legend it's mean that is final rank?
 DomiKo: yes
 Noyotens: CODINGAME SPRING CHALLENGE 2020who remeber this 
 peerdb: pacman was dope
 AntiSquid: back when emotes inside messages worked
 KalamariKing: How'd the end of the contest play out
 ItsNotABug: pacman was great, this one was decent. And i just didnt enjoy autumn at all
 AntiSquid: autumn one was for sim fans :P
 Nerchio: idk but a lot of post mortems have different approaches
 Nerchio: so it seems like it was pretty good
 kurnevsky: &gt; autumn one was for sim fans :P
 Nerchio: i think if they upped the character limit for easier NNs it wouldnt be too bad
 derjack: then NN guys would take it all
 sprkrd: I think that, if CG wanted to support NNs, they would switch to a completely different submit system
 salmon: NN?
 sprkrd: Neural nets
 jrke: NN -&gt; Neural network
 salmon: ah
 AntiSquid: there's virtually no ML support at all . other sites have it so why not CG is the question
 eulerscheZahl: completely switching isn't that easy, technical debt
 sprkrd: I'd say because CG is not really an AI side
 sprkrd: site*
 sprkrd: it's a programming site
 nmahoude: eulerscheZahl yes I know but i fixed the depth of my BS to 6 (something I didn't tell in my PM)  and I rarely used the 100ms
 eulerscheZahl: they even store each of your code. no diffs like you know it from git
 sprkrd: ultimately it's about we programming better
 eulerscheZahl: i see nmahoude
 Nerchio: thats what i mean, character limit seems like a pain for NNs and it shoudn't matter that much
 AntiSquid: it doesn't make sense to completely switch, but offering more support is always possible and better compared to offering no support
 eulerscheZahl: i get 40k in 80ms btw
 RoboStac: Most of the time the way to get a good bot is to make the NN as small as possible so it's quicker - the character limit doesn't often get in the way
 eulerscheZahl: with an expensive eval
 sprkrd: not about minmaxing contests with brute force and hours of CPU/GPU usage&#160;:)
 Hasuzawa: there is only so much to do and learn on this site, there are many more technically superior site out there
 derjack: given one-hots inputs, the space if more of issue than computation size
 Nerchio: RoboStac ok good to know but every time someone talks about NN character limit pops up :D
 sprkrd: then the person with the biggest computer and the most resources would always win
 RoboStac: well, it's something that does limit the options available a bit
 AntiSquid: not really sprkrd
 RoboStac: but whether the other options would ever work due to cpu limitations etc is a different question
 Nerchio: sprkrd you can see some very experienced people tried NNs here and it didn't work like you say it works
 derjack: sprkrd not really. crappy designed NN will be crappy even given millions $$$ of cpu/gpus
 sprkrd: sure thing, but there's other factors to consider
 AntiSquid: even for ML focused challenges on ML focused sites you get folks that get 1st place with something like C++ inside python code so ...
 RoboStac: eg convolution networks tend to hit code space limits quickly but also tend to be very slow
 sprkrd: the current format limits the size of the networks, and the available options
 Nerchio: AntiSquid lolz
 sprkrd: if you allow to submit code projects rather than a single source file, then people will switch to tensorflow, keras, pytorch or whatever
 Nerchio: i have to try an NN once on codingame would be nice if it could play in gold at least :D
 peerdb: I would love to be able so split up my cpp file here
 sprkrd: there would be no longer any ingenuity exercise on coding a NN in a small source file
 Tiramon: Oware is a nive simple game to try a NN
 RoboStac: I wouldn't recommend this contest as a starting point Nerchio&#160;:)
 Tiramon: *nice
 Nerchio: peerdb you can use bundlers
 AntiSquid: it's pointless painful overhead sprkrd
 Nerchio: RoboStac yeah i thought about Oware 
 peerdb: oh i didnt know about bundlers Nerchio
 peerdb: thats pretty cool
 E_pur_si_muove: where can I find post mortems' of the spring challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/</a>
 jrke: i am not sure what NN does exactly, so is it used for getting value of a state?
 RoboStac: yeah, owares a good choice (i found it easy to get started and had good results, though I know some others have struggled)
 E_pur_si_muove: thx
 eulerscheZahl: try again tomorrow and there wil be some more
 sprkrd: I guess I'm just not a supporter of supposedly programming contests dominated by NNs
 AntiSquid: i imagine NN would be favorable here since a lot of the contest was focused on evaluation
 Tiramon: my NN in oware is only suck in some states .. .i will have to train it again&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you mean stuck?
 AntiSquid: :joy:
 Tiramon: yeah ... stuck ...
 Tiramon: my bot in oware can't handle it if opp side is getting empty
 Tiramon: guess i need to seed some training situations like that to the NN
 derjack: again with the seeds
 derjack: i would start with training value network only
 ThunderbirdOne: man, Code Golf in C#... not the best&#160;:')
 Hasuzawa: wait until you use Java
 AntiSquid: how's the fullstack life btw ThunderbirdOne?
 eulerscheZahl: will get better with C#9
 ThunderbirdOne: same it has always been I suppose :P
 eulerscheZahl: consultant
 ThunderbirdOne: I got Don't Panic to 445... but i'm out of ideas
 ThunderbirdOne: my base algo was prolly not super efficient either
 ThunderbirdOne: what improvements do you see with C# 9 btw eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: you can write code outside of class and main function
 ThunderbirdOne: ah right
 ThunderbirdOne: top level statements
 ThunderbirdOne: i do have some hacks to shorten stuff :P
 ThunderbirdOne: like
 ThunderbirdOne: namespace System{using static Console;using static Int32;class Q{static string[] r =&gt; ReadLine().Split(' ');static void Main(){
 eulerscheZahl: the standard tricks
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is totally not into golfing</b></p><p><img src="/a/62856860719935" /> KalamariKing: why can't you get rid of the spaces before and after the =&gt;
 ThunderbirdOne: also made
 ThunderbirdOne: Func&lt;string,int&gt;p=Parse;
 ThunderbirdOne: to swap all those out
 KalamariKing: I haven't done c# in a while so il
 KalamariKing: idk*
 TobiasA: hey KalamariKing you've been out for a while
 KalamariKing: just the weekend
 eulerscheZahl: var p=Parse?
 ThunderbirdOne: think you could var that?
 TobiasA: noice
 KalamariKing: and UGH I can't do python anymore, been using Java too long
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a reason against it
 TobiasA: haha
 B4tiste: Does someone know how many challenges are available in clash of code .

 VizGhar: aaah&#160;:) CoC questions are back
 KalamariKing: yeah lol
 VizGhar: funny how I have strategy similar to postmortems except I was too slow + scoring was (just a bit) off.
 KalamariKing: Speaking of, where ARE the postmortems
 KalamariKing: I assume they're not on cg
 sprkrd: forum
 sprkrd: feedback and strategies

 KalamariKing: K thanks
 VizGhar: python 40LoC :O
 sprkrd: League of Cards?
 AntiSquid: LCM, legends of code and magic
 VizGhar: Lines of Code
 sprkrd: (I know, it was just a joke&#160;:) )
 AntiSquid: well you'll have to adapt your acronym otherwise i'll interpret it as LCM
 sprkrd: When I read Lo+Something my brain automatically interprets it as League of Something
 VizGhar: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code</a>
 VizGhar: well we probably shouldn't use acronyms at all :D
 derjack: y
 sprkrd: I think there's a special beauty in minimalist bots that get that far
 Marchete: lol
 sprkrd: Not saying necessarily golf (I despise golf), but doing as little as needed to perform good. I think elderly's has one of my favorite bots because of that. However, bear in mind that he says 40 lines + starter
 Marchete: full legend resubmit?
 Marchete: why?
 eulerscheZahl: ask saiksy or whoever did that
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just sit it out
 eulerscheZahl: now he have to wait a bit longer to finally know who won
 kurnevsky: Don't we know it already?&#160;:)
 DomiKo: ofc we don't :sweat_smile:
 KalamariKing: code golf is awesome idk what you all are on about
 eulerscheZahl: bot contests
 KalamariKing: yeah but you all are saying code golf sucks
 sprkrd: it's just me saying that it sucks
 sprkrd: it's not the general feeling :D
 KalamariKing: hmm interesting
 KalamariKing: I'm skimming pretty hard
 Astrobytes: It sucks. Change my mind.
 KalamariKing: see theres two
 sprkrd: i didn't know about the second one, sowwy&#160;:(
 DomiKo: ofc it sucks
 sprkrd: Ok, there's consensus, nevermind
 DomiKo: why cares about three less chars in your code?
 KalamariKing: astro I'm not gonna be able to, but I think its pure beauty because I do stuff with, like, boot sector games and very small roms and stuff
 KalamariKing: like microchip programming
 AntiSquid: it depends on the individual
 KalamariKing: so using a modern language, but really freaking compressed, that's just cool
 AntiSquid: but don't think it fits in with rest of the site
 KalamariKing: idk
 KalamariKing: it really doesn't I'll give you that
 sprkrd: KalamariKing I'd argue that's not necessarily golfing
 Astrobytes: ^
 KalamariKing: Microchip programming? its not
 Astrobytes: It's about being clever
 Hasuzawa: true, it is not even properly advertised like other sections
 sprkrd: (the thing about boot sectors and all that)
 KalamariKing: Yeah ik
 KalamariKing: But using a modern language in the same way is, in a way
 KalamariKing: If any of that makes sense
 Astrobytes: Nope.
 AntiSquid: how about a "represent everything in bitmasks" section instead of code golf? :D
 sprkrd: I mean, if there's hardware restrictions, there's art in doing things with lest instructions, less cycles or whatever
 RoboStac: thats just bot contests
 Astrobytes: That's the board game section 
 sprkrd: but being performant with modern languages doesn't necessarily amount to golfing
 AntiSquid: solo i meant
 Astrobytes: optims
 sprkrd: in a lot of cases i'd argue it makes the program even less performant
 AntiSquid: optims don't count compression 
 ableflyer: does anyone know when will the fall competition starts
 sprkrd: In the fall
 ableflyer: like at the start of school?
 ThunderbirdOne: YouDontSay.jpg
 sprkrd: Which I think starts around tomorrow
 ThunderbirdOne: fall is autumn... its later this year
 peerdb: ableflyer the exact day isnt known yet
 ableflyer: oh
 sprkrd: I was clearly kidding :D
 KalamariKing: but were you
 sprkrd: &gt;.&gt;
 AntiSquid: grilled kalamari . bmp
 elderlybeginner: which puzzle is good for learing minimax, mcts or any other simulation algorithm?
 KalamariKing: all of them except that one
 eulerscheZahl: 2048 for beam search
 sprkrd: the ultimate tic tac toe one I'd say
 eulerscheZahl: UTTT isn't a puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: or does it qualify for you too elderlybeginner?
 sprkrd: I assumed he meant competition, because I don't see any use of minimax in a puzzle
 elderlybeginner: i don't know what uttt is
 AntiSquid: type in the search bar at the top see what you get
 eulerscheZahl: ultimate tic tac toe
 ThunderbirdOne: I liked Code vs Zombies for a mcts
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/tic-tac-toe</a>
 eulerscheZahl: vanilla MCTS with enough sims gets you into legend
 elderlybeginner: I mean any puzzle, bot, optimatization - it's about learing an algoritm of that kind
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/bandas">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/bandas</a>another MCTS
 BrunoFelthes: how many is enough?
 KalamariKing: a l l   o f   t h e m
 eulerscheZahl: 20-25k rollouts in early game
 BrunoFelthes: i tried very hard mcts with java and bitboards, and it was not enough
 eulerscheZahl: i switched from C# to C++
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/3RAD9SR">https://imgur.com/a/3RAD9SR</a> elderlybeginner
 sprkrd: elderlybeginner btw, I praised your bot for the spring2021 contest&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: the games even have tags. i just don't always trust them
 sprkrd: Read your PM at the forum
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. connect4 says minimax. feels more like MCTS to me
 elderlybeginner: AntiSquid thanks, that's helpful 
 BrunoFelthes: I do 1000 rollouts, at ttt, to low...
 eulerscheZahl: not even close
 eulerscheZahl: even my C# got around 10k
 elderlybeginner: sparkrd You didn't see it, thanks for credit :joy:
 JohnCM: i used MCTS for tic tac toe in python, got silver
 JohnCM: if i adapt it for C++, it should be gold
 sprkrd: Connect4 is a solved game, with minimax, can it be fully solved in CG too in the time you are given...?
 eulerscheZahl: connect4 on CG has a larger board
 derjack: connect4 on CG is 9x8
 JohnCM: connect4 to solve it with minimax, haha
 BrunoFelthes: no, it is 5000, but it is to low
 derjack: err 9x7
 eulerscheZahl: isn#t it 9x7?
 JohnCM: you'll need a really good heuristic as you can't search the depth fully
 sprkrd: Ah, I see, didn't know 'bout that
 derjack: also it has steal rule
 eulerscheZahl: Onitama for Minimax (jacek will tell you NN and that's "the easy game")
 derjack: onitama is tutorial game
 eulerscheZahl: Tron is anohter good one for minimax
 sprkrd: I'd say Amazons would be a good candidate too (haven't done that, but I saw the Numberphile video about the game)
 derjack: amazons, the easy game?
 sprkrd: not easy
 sprkrd: a good practice for minimax
 sprkrd: and mcts
 Astrobytes: Most of the board games are good for minimax
 eulerscheZahl: jacek only calls it easy because he's first
 Astrobytes: and all extensions
 eulerscheZahl: jacek == derjack
 derjack: :O
 sprkrd: Ah, OK
 sprkrd: I thought the "the easy game" was sarcastic
 Astrobytes: MCTS is less painful than minimax for Clobber though
 sprkrd: Like, "you really think that's a good starting option?"
 derjack: i mean, the arent even tyrin
 derjack: trying
 Arez-Vater: Obama have dick
 Arez-Vater: Arez ist ein Hurensohn
 derjack: amazons may have tricky eval and has big branching factor, over 1000 in first turns
 victor_1111111: Arez ist fett
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: that time of day again clearly
 eulerscheZahl: DJSilentComet_8010 has been banned by Astrobytes.
 sprkrd: May I ask, why do some of you have two accounts?
 eulerscheZahl: who was that one?
 Astrobytes: I only banned Arez, that happens sometimes. Donno why
 sprkrd: Like jacek = derjack and eulerscheZahl = (UndercoverToad I think?)
 Astrobytes: I have an alt for testing games and contest chats if it's busy. I don't use it for anything serious.
 derjack: I? for the trolling
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i'm undercoverToad
 eulerscheZahl: chat got laggy for me during contest
 eulerscheZahl: now it's better again
 eulerscheZahl: still a bit slow
 Astrobytes: The bar is getting bigger
 sprkrd: of course, too many admirers writing private messages to you in your private account :joy:
 sprkrd: of course it's laggy
 Astrobytes: No, moderators get a huge list of all users in chat
 sprkrd: makes sense to create an alt, then
 eulerscheZahl: not if your task is to moderate the chat :D
 eulerscheZahl: can't have both
 Astrobytes: :D
 KalamariKing: two computers :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: i used chromium for competing and firefox for chatting
 Astrobytes: I keep this account open on my left monitor and the alt on the right one
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still on firefox for chat, it has higher tolerance before it crashes
 Astrobytes: just in case I need to kick/ban
 eulerscheZahl: astrohydes?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 sprkrd: may I ask, do you do this on your free time or is it a job?
 eulerscheZahl: free time, unpaid
 Astrobytes: Free time, as and when
 sprkrd: big part of your daily entertainment, then
 eulerscheZahl: we even create games like this in our free time (shameless advertising) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/8758470df0f4ccc4ad5c774d20935cf59c7698">https://www.codingame.com/demo/8758470df0f4ccc4ad5c774d20935cf59c7698</a>
 sprkrd: must feel like a job sometimes coming up with all the games and puzzles you've created
 derjack: :notebook: :soccer:?
 B4tiste: WAn we report clashcode challenge that are wrong in the statement&#160;?
 B4tiste: Can*
 eulerscheZahl: you can tell us here, maybe someone will edit it
 eulerscheZahl: not me, i don't have the permission for clashes
 Astrobytes: I don't either
 derjack: yet you are chat moderators :thinking:
 itzluku: that dice game looks cool&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yes. I chat often, I never clash :P
 eulerscheZahl: editing clash requires 300+ participations
 eulerscheZahl: i can edit puzzles
 Tiramon: hm only 122 participations ...
 Hasuzawa: I actaully study good answers from other players in CoC so maybe I learn more from CoC than puzzles
 Tiramon: maybe i should increase that so atleast some mod can fix clashs&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you will get captchas
 derjack: oh dice duel ready for approval eh
 eulerscheZahl: a bold move from me, i'll see what happens
 actualCoderTrevor: Woah 3D graphics :O nice!
 Tiramon: at clash a day keeps the captcha away ... or something like that
 Tiramon: *a 
 Astrobytes: A noble sacrifice indeed :P 
 derjack: is it me or dice duel demo suddenly stops and i cant resume it
 elderlybeginner: What has changed that there are less contests now then it was a few years ago?
 derjack: $$$
 actualCoderTrevor: derjack that seems to happen to me too
 Astrobytes: Yeah derjack. Not sure if it's intended to stop there or not
 eulerscheZahl: it resumes when you do something to update the viewer (like fullscreen)
 eulerscheZahl: it's part of the SDK. i could get around it but it's a feature
 derjack: oh, normally the click would works
 eulerscheZahl: you don't want that flashy animation while reading the statemetn
 Astrobytes: It also resumes randomly by itself
 eulerscheZahl: click is captured by 3D library
 eulerscheZahl: for rotation
 Astrobytes: Oh man, I didn't see the landscape etc
 actualCoderTrevor: Ohh you can change the view&#160;! :O
 Astrobytes: Nice touch euler
 derjack: eulerscheZahl boldly of you to assume someone would read the statement though
 actualCoderTrevor: Double rainbow!
 eulerscheZahl: huh? there should only be 1 rainbow
 Astrobytes: It looks nice, just leave it
 actualCoderTrevor: Nope. It's clearly doubled. What does it mean?
 actualCoderTrevor: I like it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: let me check
 ZarthaxX: hey
 gmessier: double rainbow!
 Astrobytes: HeyrthaxX!
 derjack: eeyup, double rainbow
 eulerscheZahl: oh that. that's part of the asset
 Tiramon: hm that dice duel looks kind of fun =)
 KiwiTae: omg ZarthaxX o/ you brought back the bear
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i tought you have 1 in front and one behind you
 gmessier: It's new that we can build 3d games&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://opengameart.org/node/36621">https://opengameart.org/node/36621</a>
 ABC123: Do you join clubhouse?
 ZarthaxX: KiwiTae i brought it for you man
 ZarthaxX: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you always could since the SDK exists and you can upload your own stuff
 ZarthaxX: you just didnt see it in time
 KiwiTae: :heart_eyes:
 Astrobytes: hey hey KiwiTae
 eulerscheZahl: it's just not documented and you have to get creative
 eulerscheZahl: some javascript to kill the original viewer and inject your own
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes heyhey
 gmessier: We are programmer... we can do anything :P
 ZarthaxX: astroooooo
 ZarthaxX: contest is finally over for you astro hehe
 Astrobytes: hehehe yeah, fixed a small bug this morning and gained a whole 100 ranks :P
 ZarthaxX: :o
 ZarthaxX: nice
 eulerscheZahl: ClockSort had a funny bug: small trees could cast shadow on bigger ones
 eulerscheZahl: from gold straight to legend #20 yesterday
 Marchete: people don't test enough
 ZarthaxX: btw, i dont get this, i win some games but my score keeps decreasing
 Astrobytes: hehehe that's an *epic* bug
 ZarthaxX: why does trueskill work like this&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: maybe im seeng score with delay
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl but he also allowed in his sim to seed everywhere
 ZarthaxX: intended bug that works better
 Marchete: with a good simulator you can guess endgame score if you play against yourself
 ZarthaxX: i dont get it yet lol
 Marchete: I did and it worked nicely
 ZarthaxX: nice Marchete
 nitekat: had lots of works to do these days, have no time to fix my code, finished in gold, so sad... :disappointed:
 Astrobytes: No legend Marchete?
 Marchete: lol no
 Marchete: more like 1400 gold
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 Marchete: my eval wasn't working in mid game
 Marchete: and I just give up
 sprkrd: did you do beam search too?
 Astrobytes: I finished 1409 gold. Sad
 Marchete: without a proper eval is irrelevant
 eulerscheZahl: i'm sure you will beat us (except for one) in the multiplayer
 sprkrd: but beam search, right?
 Marchete: I don't think so
 Marchete: but if I do, I'll try what recurs_e did
 Marchete: probably NN :D
 derjack: oO
 Marchete: I was sure Beam Search wasn't the best algo
 Marchete: so I refused to do it
 sprkrd: heh, I evaluated all actions but with depth=1
 Marchete: in fact I think my submitted was the heuristic
 Marchete: probably 3 hours of code on top of the starter bot
 jacek: where do you see  your rank
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global</a>

 sprkrd: ah, you beat me
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: and everyone beats me, i'm dropping&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: nap time, i'm tired
 Marchete: I think robo gave very good ideas about NNing the game
 sprkrd: I mean, he was faster than me posting the link 
 Marchete: they are really interesting
 sprkrd: Actually my bot seems to be a bit better&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Afternoon nap-time for Old Man Euler :D
 Marchete: when do you get up euler?
 sprkrd: What I don't understand about robo's NN is why he encodes the sun points as a OHE input
 Astrobytes: 4 or 5 am iirc Marchete
 actualCoderTrevor: How long before we can revisit this contest? I was never happy with my bot.
 sprkrd: isn't that a clearly numeric feature? Why the trouble of a 1-hot?
 Marchete: I saw his submit time at 4:30 am
 Marchete: that's why I'm asking
 BrunoFelthes: actualCoderTrevor, maybe some hours
 derjack: apparently 5 sun points is much different than 6 sun points
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh cool&#160;:)
 sprkrd: shouldn't the NN pick that up even if encoded as a numeric input?
 derjack: now when i showed him one hots are really hot, he uses them everywhere
 Marchete: maybe sun points matter for move selection
 Marchete: and the NN will know better what actions are valid
 sprkrd: I assume it does, but I cannot clearly see the benefit of the one hot here
 derjack: NN maybe could figure it out, but 'preprocessing' inputs makes the NN to understand it better with fewer hidden layers/units
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: like on oware
 sprkrd: a threshold in a numeric feature is something a NN can clearly do with just a layer, with a sigmoid or a relu
 Marchete: Robo said earlier
 Marchete: his oware bot trained 10x faster
 sprkrd: It's a whole art this thing about designing a NN :sweat_smile:
 Marchete: when converting all to one-hot
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/oware-abapa/leaderboard</a>
 Marchete: I'd listen to him
 Astrobytes: a black art at that
 Astrobytes: Almost witchcraft
 sprkrd: so that's oware
 sprkrd: I didn't have a clue of what you were talking about
 Marchete: oware is oware abapa
 Marchete: a game about seeds
 Astrobytes: :D
 derjack: and spring challenge is about seeds too
 sprkrd: Yeah, I didn't know about the game
 Marchete: well, each position can have 0-N seeds
 Astrobytes: What a description Marchete
 Marchete: they encoded as one-hot
 sprkrd: I thought you were talking about some obscure NN thing
 sprkrd: The oware architecture or something like that
 derjack: people called me a madman when i said i use one hots
 sprkrd: It's the only thing natural language processing people uses, right?
 sprkrd: They see a number other than 0 or 1 and the go all crazy
 sprkrd: they*
 derjack: its off/on
 derjack: its faster to calculate
 derjack: and for some board game, even faster because you only calculate the difference
 ThunderbirdOne: anyone know when c# 9 is coming to CG&#160;?
 derjack: i.e. NNUE for chess
 RoboStac: even if you don't do NNUE you can massively optimise it by skipping the 0 inputs 
 peerdb: not NN, but I was wondering how I could have made my gamestates as small as possible, I saved all the trees in a map&lt;int, Tree&gt; (C++), because I didnt know how else to save a variable amount of trees.Is there a better way?
 Astrobytes: They just did a languages update ThunderbirdOne, so probably not for a while
 Marchete: skipping zero inputs?
 Marchete: ahh
 RoboStac: it's just a big matrix multiply so if the input value is 0 you don't need to calculate 96 lots of 0xweight
 Marchete: I get it
 sprkrd: peerdb I did it using four uint64_t numbers
 derjack: peerdb bitboards?
 sprkrd: the state has a constant size this way, very easy and fast to calculate hash (should you need that) and very performant equality check
 sprkrd: another bitmask for ownership, and another bitmask for dormant status
 sprkrd: 6 uint64_t in total for a state
 peerdb: can 4 uint64_t's save 37 trees?
 derjack: RoboStac but you still used python framework for training?
 peerdb: interesting
 sprkrd: yes
 RoboStac: yeah
 Marchete: and richness outside the state
 Marchete: as static
 derjack: used sparse vector something?
 Marchete: we all did the same :D
 peerdb: how many bytes was your total gamestate sprkrd
 RoboStac: no, the training just takes it as a dense vector without optimising it
 HakamGo: Are they gonna rerun the Tests for all Leagues now?
 sprkrd: 8*6=48bytes
 peerdb: for 1 gamestate? jeeez mine was 208
 RoboStac: but it's run on the gpu so fairly quick
 Astrobytes: peerdb:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33500946.pdf</a>
 derjack: hmm
 Twelve0: no HakamGo just for legend 
 sprkrd: I started with map too thinking it wouldn't matter that much
 peerdb: thanks Astrobytes im gonna read that one, I'd never heard of bitboarding before this contest
 Astrobytes: also check chess programming wiki
 HakamGo: Twelve0, hahahah are you sure??
 Astrobytes: Just for legend HakamGo
 sprkrd: when my first MCTS was capping a ~70 simulations in the first turn, I decided it was time to upgrade to bit boards
 iggy12345: good morning
 sprkrd: then I dropped MCTS anyway and did evaluations with just 1 depth of moves&#160;:)
 sprkrd: seeing the success of Magus, I should've pressed on MCTS
 peerdb: when doing beamsearch, how many moves should you at least be able to look forward (as rule of thumb)&#160;?
 sprkrd: nice read Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a great paper
 derjack: dont spoil the ending
 Astrobytes: lol
 sprkrd: If I had found that paper earlier, I'd have done my shadow calculations with bit shifts instead of using look-up tables
 Astrobytes: Did no one link it during the contest?
 Marchete: i did all with shifts
 Marchete: it was natural to do it
 sprkrd: Didn't occur to me organize the cells in a way different from the numeric index
 sprkrd: I mean, it's natural if you don't put cell 0 in bit 0 of your number and so on
 Marchete: it's natural when you read about hex bitboarding :D
 Marchete: what I found slow is move generation
 sprkrd: That's what I was missing, never worked with hex boards earlier
 Marchete: 70% of the time for me
 Marchete: (well, also the eval)
 sprkrd: Astrobytes probably, I wasn't around very much in the chats/forum
 Astrobytes: ah, gotcha
 Marchete: #es forum is usually silent, if you were looking there
 sprkrd: No, not at all
 Marchete: ah
 sprkrd: I wasn't around in any chat/discord/forum
 Astrobytes: It's usually good to read the chat, even if you're not chatting, during contests - you can pick up a lot of good info
 sprkrd: Was going full autistic for the contest :joy:
 sprkrd: Astrobytes yes, will consider that in the future
 Astrobytes: then when you've had enough, ?disableChat
 Tiramon: hm easy score in coc today ... so many people using c for shortest&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't sound like a smart idea
 eulerscheZahl: and how many real people and how many bots?
 Tiramon: afaik no bots ... at least not the bots i know of
 Marchete: you guys are doing coc?
 Tiramon: i do some to get rights to edit clashs&#160;:) at least one mod should have rights to do it&#160;;)
 Tiramon: still the same bots according to leaderboard, so yes quite low amount of bots =)
 Marchete: 125, that's "normal"
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a>
 Tiramon: right
 Marchete: wth, 130000 clashes?
 Magus: sprkrd: there is more successful than me in MCTS
 Marchete: bots, no?
 Magus: jolindien is better :D
 Marchete: yeah, bot
 Tiramon: those with &gt; 10k games are the bots quite easy to filter&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and these with &gt; 40 score points in the contest too
 Marchete: struc_t is a tryhard CoC'er
 sprkrd: Magus: didn't know he used MCTS
 Marchete: 3800 clashes
 sprkrd: Now that's my new milestone
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/22">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/22</a>
 eulerscheZahl: "My strategy is based on … surprise … MCTS."
 sprkrd: I'll confess I skimmed very fast through the post&#160;:)
 sprkrd: this zobrist hashing thing caught my attention
 sprkrd: sounds like a cult
 sprkrd: the zobrist hashing cult
 sprkrd: of the zobrist church
 Astrobytes: Zobrist cult :rofl:
 StevenV: I really like this challenge, as bot simulator is not the only way to looking for :D
 Magus: I had zobrist hashing at first, but I had far too many cache miss
 Magus: So I removed it
 Marchete: ahh, weird
 eulerscheZahl: is that what the game is about? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/cultist-wars">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/cultist-wars</a>
 Marchete: lol
 sprkrd: Hell, Kodle also used a hash map for MCTS? why the hell was I getting so few simulations then?
 Marchete: pragma?
 sprkrd: I thought the reason I was getting so few simulations was because of the hash map, instead of using a tree of pointers
 Marchete: pragma O3
 Marchete: yes
 sprkrd: doesn't CG do that too?
 sprkrd: in the FAQ page they say they compile the code with -O3
 Marchete: give us your 3 first lines
 Marchete: really?
 Marchete: that's new
 sprkrd: it's been there a few years I think :S
 Marchete: then no
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Marchete: said nothing about that
 Astrobytes: g++ 10.2.1 mode C++17With the following libraries ‑lm, ‑lpthread, ‑ldl, ‑lcrypt
 sprkrd: what the...
 sprkrd: really?
 Marchete: ofc
 Astrobytes: Hence the pragmas&#160;;)
 derjack: use Ofast [solved]
 sprkrd: My brain filled that there for no reason
 The_Auditor: when will spring challenge convert to multi&#160;?
 Magus: Ofast is like O3 with fast-math. It can improve speed if you use a lot of double/float.
 sprkrd: So, the reason I got so few simulations and get so poor performance in general is because I miss a pragma?
 Marchete: congrats, you were baptized in CG's C++ 
 eulerscheZahl: probably today or tomorrow The_Auditor
 derjack: Magus aka NN stuff
 sprkrd: I'm gonna update all my bots immediately
 derjack: youll probably get 3x speedup
 sprkrd: My UTTT bot was in legend and wasn't using O3
 sprkrd: I wonder what that will do
 peerdb: damn sprkrd I had the same last contest, I didnt know how pragmas worked and had them below my #includes
 derjack: :scream:
 derjack: keep in mind #pragma must be as first line
 sprkrd: yeah yeah
 Marchete: welcome to CG
 sprkrd: my first current line is an include from the std
 derjack: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,unroll-loops,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 MSmits: hi there
 Astrobytes: :D
 peerdb: derjack can I have a comment above my pragmas?
 sprkrd: I've been around for so many years and didn't know this
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: comments are ignored
 sprkrd: I thought CG was doing the sane thing and compiling with -O3
 Astrobytes: Hi MSmits
 Vry: About prgma&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/first-avx-code-sqrt-calculation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/first-avx-code-sqrt-calculation</a>
 Vry: *pragma
 RoboStac: the pragma just has to be before any code you want optimising (including templates in includes)
 peerdb: oh okay lol cus CLion automatically put a comment there and I never thought about it
 MSmits: hi Astrobytes, contest done finally.
 Astrobytes: Indeed :D
 derjack: eeyup
 MSmits: glad i got into legend, but didnt improve after that
 sprkrd: Thank you, thank you all
 sprkrd: Indeed the chat is useful
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Marchete: I think the no-zeroupper got it wrong
 sprkrd: never used pragmas to indicate compiler options, should I do it like in the first line of the code you sent for vectorized sqrt, Vry?
 Marchete: sometimes I saw no-zero-upper, no-zeroupper
 derjack: dunno what no zero upper does, just copy pasted mindlessly
 derjack: as all the things i do
 Marchete: but I think it's no-vzeroupper
 MSmits: contests used to have two brackets. The search guys at the top, below that, heuristic, more or less
 Marchete: anyways that has little impact
 Marchete: I'd say none
 MSmits: they now have 3 brackets&#160;:)
 peerdb: this contest heuristics got into legend too
 Astrobytes: 3?
 MSmits: yes, i meant generally
 Marchete: I know derjack, I put the no-zero-upper somewhere and got copied
 MSmits: with some mixing
 Marchete: because I keep seeing it
 MSmits: the 1st bracket will soon be NN's astro
 MSmits: like how it is in boardgames
 Astrobytes: Ahhh yeah, gotcha
 MSmits: and csb
 Marchete: also these pragmas were for that test
 RoboStac: afaik no-zero-upper was a problem on original avx implementations but on most cpus doesn't really do much
 MSmits: search guys complaining nn's are unfair are now in the same boat as heuristic guys complaining search is unfair&#160;:)
 ItsNotABug: battle for 3rd is looking close
 Astrobytes: The One True AI
 RoboStac: as an nn guy who's below the search guys can I complain the other way?&#160;:)
 sprkrd: I don't think NNs are unfair
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 MSmits: did you do a NN for this contest RoboStac?
 Astrobytes: Check the PMs MSmits, some really good ones
 RoboStac: yeah
 MSmits: havent had time yet. been teaching, omw home now
 Astrobytes: ah I see
 derjack: omw?
 MSmits: well RoboStac, i still think it's ballsy to try it
 Astrobytes: on my way
 MSmits: good job
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see a reason to complain. in theory everyone can build a NN and dominate
 eulerscheZahl: it still requires a lot of work and skill
 Astrobytes: Yep
 eulerscheZahl: but equal changes nontheless
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl i agree, i am just saying the complaining is equivalent
 eulerscheZahl: right, those evil searches ruining my heuristic bot
 MSmits: though when someone counterbooks a NN though...
 Astrobytes: Heh heh heh
 eulerscheZahl: also ban C++ it's unfair. and give me 1s for python
 ItsNotABug: eulerscheZahl You've taken back over top German
 MSmits: not a problem in contests ofc
 MSmits: too random
 MSmits: lol yes languages
 eulerscheZahl: that will go on for a bit, i'm not even watching
 eulerscheZahl: final results in 3-4h maybe
 peerdb: allow assembly and watch new dominance unravel
 MSmits: 1 thing would be fair to complain about, if a contest somehow requires loads of expensive local calculation time
 MSmits: i kinda liked my 8 x brutaltester
 MSmits: didnt make me do better though, but was convenient
 Marchete: ban brutaltester too
 Marchete: it's unfair
 MSmits: could have written my own :P
 Marchete: banned too!
 MSmits: was pretty easy this contest
 eulerscheZahl: i had a bigger problem with fantastic bits tbh
 MSmits: oh Marchete
 eulerscheZahl: physics game without public referee
 MSmits: we had this discussion about beam width right?
 MSmits: beam depth sry
 eulerscheZahl: so there were those few hardcode-CSB players that could quickly write an engine
 MSmits: i accidentally set my beam_width as depth (1000 turns) and my bot performed the same :P
 eulerscheZahl: and for the rest of us it was out of reach to adapt that fast
 reCurse: Good morNNing
 Marchete: weeeee
 eulerscheZahl: good afternoon
 MSmits: morning reCurse
 VizGhar: aaah confirmed :D
 Marchete: automatonNN is here
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, a massive win
 reCurse: Oh there's even 2 Ns in afternoon, missed opportunity
 reCurse: Thanks
 Astrobytes: Yeah, well done
 derjack: and evening
 MSmits: thanks for motivating me even more to learn this nn stuff reCurse
 Marchete: he hasn't said anything, no?
 Marchete: about NN
 reCurse: NNo
 Marchete: lel
 MSmits: doesnt need to i think
 Marchete: yeah
 derjack: nneed
 Marchete: after seeing his first move
 MSmits: but sure, i could be wrong
 Marchete: in some replays
 Marchete: I was thinking, wth!?
 VizGhar: we are waiting for that post mortem&#160;:)
 reCurse: I briefly considered renaming to Totozero :p
 Marchete: so I assumed NN
 MSmits: missed opportunity
 Astrobytes: lol
 olifozzy: NN is the new GG
 eulerscheZahl: on a scale from 1 to 10, how exhausted are you this time?
 reCurse: Um
 MSmits: who?
 eulerscheZahl: reCurse
 reCurse: A bit over the first half: 11
 reCurse: Last few days: 6? 7?
 darkhorse64: overheated maybe&#160;?
 MSmits: once it works, it works eh?
 reCurse: My allergies are killing me
 reCurse: So probably mostly that
 eulerscheZahl: so no BotG-like PTSD to expected this time
 reCurse: Most of the work done was outside the contest eh
 eulerscheZahl: right, that's clear to me
 MSmits: oh and will you just be back for contests reCurse? Earlier people were saying you left CG
 reCurse: I took a CG hiatus for over a month before contest
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Considered leaving CG yeah
 MSmits: well it doesnt have to be a all or nothing thing
 MSmits: plenty of people come here just for contests
 reCurse: Just too frustrated with the direction this site is going
 reCurse: But contest is always that magical time of the year
 ThunderbirdOne: I haven't been here for a year either
 ThunderbirdOne: it's fine
 ThunderbirdOne: though i'm not a mod of course :P
 ThunderbirdOne: i am missable
 eulerscheZahl: you used to be a missile
 MSmits: reCurse maybe just focus on the part that is fun for you however small it is. No need to be involved in big picture stuff. I don't
 davilla: what direction is that?
 reCurse: Well here's the thing, wasn't sure if I was going to disclose it but
 reCurse: Whatever
 sprkrd: reCurse what is it you don't like about the site?
 reCurse: I'll be switching to human learning in a month or two
 eulerscheZahl: less contests, less competitive direction
 reCurse: :P
 reCurse: So who knows after that
 MSmits: wait, do you mean becoming a teacher?
 reCurse: Father
 MSmits: ohhh
 ThunderbirdOne: oh congrats!
 eulerscheZahl: oh, congrats
 MSmits: awesomenes
 Astrobytes: Oh wow, congrats!
 ZarthaxX: cognratzz
 MSmits: congrats
 ZarthaxX: amazing man
 Kellthazar: gratz
 Wontonimo: Congrats, a new NN in the family
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: it learns in real time
 MSmits: human learning lol... forgive me for misunderstanding that one :P
 reCurse: I finally get the legitimate right to dad jokes
 MSmits: yep
 reCurse: Not gonna let that one go to waste
 reCurse: Thanks everyone
 Astrobytes: hah!
 davilla: wonder which human will be learning, him or the kid
 reCurse: So yeah it's been on my mind
 MSmits: both
 reCurse: Whether I have time for CG at all after that
 MSmits: depends on your family
 MSmits: every family is different
 MSmits: I still get a lot of spare time
 Wontonimo: the first 2 years of my kids life is a complete blur
 MSmits: but yeah first few yrs, a lot less time
 Wontonimo: but there are pictures that prove it happened and in every one of them I look like someone just woke me up
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: lol
 reCurse: I'm still going to do tons of machine learning stuff, just the competition stuff tends to pull away way too much of my focus
 MSmits: my daughter was born 3 months after i started teaching for real
 derjack: so, teaching gives you babies?
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 is also competing occasionally. and then skipping a contest again
 eulerscheZahl: you can still play like him
 reCurse: I'm an all or nothing kind
 MSmits: eh no, Astrobytes please explain how much time babies need to grow
 Astrobytes: :D
 derjack: 3 days
 reCurse: It bothers me to think of "what if I had 100% dedication" etc
 eulerscheZahl: all on 1 contest and nothing on another?
 MSmits: yeah I can see why that would bother you, it would even bother me, so i imagine it would be worse for you
 reCurse: shrug
 Wontonimo: it's a new variable for the contests
 reCurse: I don't know what to expect at all tbh
 reCurse: Kinda nervous
 reCurse: So playing pessimistic
 ThunderbirdOne: it'll be fine&#160;;)
 ThunderbirdOne: just enjoy the ride
 reCurse: Will do
 MSmits: sleep when you can&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: yes
 ThunderbirdOne: nothing wrong with siestas, dont let anyone tell you otherwise :P
 MSmits: i should not complain, sleepless stuff only lasted a couple days for me
 davilla: your other half is probably complaining then
 MSmits: she was, sure
 kovi: gratz recurse and gratz
 reCurse: She's very understanding, I'm blessed
 reCurse: Thanks
 Wontonimo: reBlessed 
 Astrobytes: Peaceful baby = terrible toddlerTerrible baby = anyone's guess :P
 MSmits: biggest problem we had is bottle took 45 mins each time
 MSmits: soooo slow
 davilla: I'm guessing, also terrible toddler
 reCurse: So I definitely killed this contest talk eh :p
 CouscousAgha: damn the fights are still going
 reCurse: I should not have read PMs, now I want to start over
 MSmits: yeah it always takes most of the day
 Astrobytes: A refreshing change of topic tbh reCurse&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you are even the cause of some japanese tweets
 reCurse: Yeah I saw&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Finally! You're big in Japan!
 derjack: japanese tweets?
 Wontonimo: MSmits, sometimes a long time drinking is a break from crying.  My second cried from the time she woke up to the time she went to sleep for the first2 years
 eulerscheZahl: the extraterrestrial
 MSmits: oh right, thats true Wontonimo
 MSmits: apparently i was one of those ones
 MSmits: not my daughter though
 davilla: interesting
 MSmits: I'm guessing, it was because I had no tablet like the kids do now
 MSmits: i would have been such a happy child if i had one
 MSmits: :jealous:
 Marchete: why sometimes the CG chat goes bugged and the scroll bar stopped working?
 Wontonimo: I have to admit, I had a lot of fun poking the chat when I noticed you were curb stomping the gold boss reCurse ... it was fun to see the chat explode
 CouscousAgha: wait
 CouscousAgha: how old are u guys
 reCurse: I was watching&#160;:)
 reCurse: Just didn't want to be too distracted
 MSmits: CouscousAgha 40
 reCurse: I honestly wanted to fix those losses
 Wontonimo: HAHA
 CouscousAgha: im 23...
 MSmits: oh, i will watch my language then CouscousAgha
 eulerscheZahl: i woke up at 5am, full of motivation to add a new feature to my bot after an idea I had at night
 Wontonimo: you've convinced me, it's time to build out my NN for CG tooling
 Astrobytes: I'm 38. reCurse is the oldest guy here, he's over 50 you know :P
 eulerscheZahl: opened the website, quick look at the leaderboard
 reCurse: What no
 reCurse: I'm 37
 derjack: huh
 eulerscheZahl: and then i was completely distracted
 Marchete: my first contest was with my 3month old toddler 
 Marchete: nights are long
 MSmits: did it help any eulerscheZahl?
 ZarthaxX: CouscousAgha same here
 Astrobytes: I know. Remember kovi's assertion that you were older than him?
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes did you think of kov i?
 Wontonimo: i may be oldest here
 Zaphus: I doubt it
 eulerscheZahl: yes, MSmits. it was my stupid opponent grows everything at once assumption
 eulerscheZahl: gave me 58% winrate vs old bot
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: kov i thought re Curse was older than he was
 eulerscheZahl: and translated well to arena
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i forgot about that again (or wasn't around)
 MSmits: ohh ok i tried that, was 50%
 eulerscheZahl: i know that he's approximately as old as my sister
 Wontonimo: look at my picture Zaphus, don't I look old?
 MSmits: might be poor implementation, or didnt synch well with rest of eval
 kovi: who is older: my guess was based on ambigous chat comments
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo you cant fool anyone lol
 Zaphus: Nah, Wontonimo - thats just hard living&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Too many tacos!
 Wontonimo: never
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: Dealing with school kids loose on the chat does make me age
 Astrobytes: I feel that.
 cegprakash: as always weird leaderboard and matchmaking.. not enough games in my rank range&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/cegprakash">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/cegprakash</a> 
 Marchete: parent chats :D
 CouscousAgha: yes what your language elders 
 Astrobytes: Oh, bi-annual ceg moan incoming
 CouscousAgha: my 23yo ears cant handle tough language 
 CouscousAgha: watch*
 MSmits: cegprakash thats just because you move up the ladder, it doesnt show all of it. If your bot is good enough it will get out of gold
 Astrobytes: I refuse to participate. It's the same conversation every time :rofl:
 MSmits: i did many submits to get out of gold and all of them in top 10 until 1 got out
 cegprakash: 60% win rate 
 cegprakash: not enough to climb?
 eulerscheZahl: the only winning move is not to play
 Marchete: no
 MSmits: cegprakash no its not
 MSmits: mine is almost 100% till it gets neae top
 MSmits: near
 eulerscheZahl: you get 70% at the beginning and 50% at the end
 MSmits: very roughly, yeah
 Marchete: it's true that trueskill goes grazy with ties, but overwall it's good
 RoboStac: cegprakash - looking at the stats there you have won 8 games and lost 15 in that range so you should be going downwards
 Marchete: a good with a lot of ties can put you at bottom
 CouscousAgha: cegprakash if your bot has 50%-60% in a specific rank means it belongs there
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: someone else wanna pile on?
 davilla: is that meme that well known, now?
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 davilla: doesn't even need a subtitle
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: My doctor has recommended me not to participate in those conversations
 ZarthaxX: this problem with ceg always arises heh
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: Every. Single. Time.
 eulerscheZahl: and don't tell him to read the statement
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: talking about statemen
 cegprakash: I was rank 200 in gold 
 peerdb: cegprakash i win 65% of the matches and it put me on rank 309 (82nd in gold)
 peerdb: so it seems fair
 ZarthaxX: have you seen nmahoud e pm?
 cegprakash: resubmit with improvements bang..
 cegprakash: rank 400 in gold
 eulerscheZahl: yes, iread nmahoud e
 ZarthaxX: he mentioned amount of actions in 50ms, i think he didnt notice the 100ms
 MSmits: they are not improvements :P
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i pinged him on it
 MSmits: anyways, train arriving, ttyl
 eulerscheZahl: he has a fixed depth of 6
 reCurse: :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: which is about 50ms in most cases
 ZarthaxX: did he saw the 100ms tho?
 Astrobytes: later MSmits
 ZarthaxX: ahh okey
 cegprakash: my old bot had 50% win rate and was in rank 200
 eulerscheZahl: see you, good bye
 ZarthaxX: bye MSmits
 peerdb: the level of play rises each hour ceg
 kovi: full heuristic bots are finished already
 Wontonimo: well, i'm kinda sad suddenly because I know that mostly the chat is going to be dead in a couple days.  It's been great, and hope to see everyone around from time to time before the next competition
 Astrobytes: Damn, I forgot to write my PM explaining to anyone that didn't yet see it that I didn't like the contest and euler made me do it :P
 kovi: all others are cheating and doing search in script language&#160;;)
 cegprakash: peerdb or u get caliberated bad because u had 2 bad games in the first 20 games
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: some of us will still be around&#160;;)
 reCurse: Don't forget to close with "not knocking over this contest"
 cegprakash: I used minimax and my bot is well tuned against top players
 cegprakash: especially boss
 Astrobytes: reCurse :D
 aCat: legendary bpss recurse ;p
 kovi: we still wait for my bot is nn and trained against top players...
 Wontonimo: i can count on you Astrobytes!
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 kovi: that is when the real hiding starts
 reCurse: Speaking of hiding
 reCurse: Honest question
 reCurse: If I submitted that wednesday, do you think it would have been more fair? Better?
 derjack: its fine
 derjack: i dont mind hiding :v
 Wontonimo: it's not hiding, NN take time to train
 derjack: and less chance to counterbook you eh
 kovi: this time we would have no chance for sureand it may not force me thinking to switch to duct instead of beam cause it was obviously nn
 reCurse: I was legitimately scared people would spend the next few days finding flaws
 Wontonimo: than you played it well
 kurnevsky: Anyway almost everyone have an opponent he can't beat&#160;:)
 aCat: oh ythey would ;p
 eulerscheZahl: would have tried at least
 aCat: that was great coming out recurse ;p
 aCat: fun to watch
 kovi: reasonable point recurse
 reCurse: Well it's also that
 reCurse: If I was slower, I would be less penalized
 reCurse: So makes no sense to me to early submit
 Wontonimo: in some other contests you only get to stay on if you are in the leading league.  not the case here, so it's legit okay to come in last hour

 eulerscheZahl: share that on #clash
 sprkrd: Did the pragma thing with my UTTT code, went from 2000 simulations to 10000 with my MCTS code, and went from depth 6 to depth 8 with my minimax :D
 Marchete: it's noticeable
 sprkrd: (I had both a MCTS and a negamax bot laying around)
 sprkrd: Quite a bit, yes
 _Royale: congrats to all and thanks for the PMs&#160;:-)

 eulerscheZahl: surprised not to see you higher this contest. little time?
 derjack: sprkrd so how many ranks up?
 _Royale: eulerscheZahl: little skill&#160;:(
 sprkrd: derjack I don't know until full eval, but so fat I've climbed ~80 ranks in legend
 sprkrd: so far*
 derjack: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: oh. sometimes there's just the game that you don't know how to play
 ZarthaxX: and struct is 44 rn :o
 sprkrd: I was at the dead bottom of legend because my bot timed out sometimes. I'm greedy and I want my full 100ms :joy:
 struct: :pray:
 Astrobytes: nice
 Marchete: you people don't sleep...
 struct: I just woke up
 Marchete: 4 hours?
 struct: 5+-
 Wontonimo: i had commitment issues and waffled the first 3 days if I was even going to play, then 3 days of ifelse not thinking I'd write a sim.  Greatest enemy in this game was myself.
 Wontonimo: and reBless
 eulerscheZahl: i'll answer the sleep statement with <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/CgW11GB">https://imgur.com/a/CgW11GB</a>
 Wontonimo: and really everyone in legend
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:) you are welcome wonto
 Astrobytes: Error 4:04: Sleep Not Found
 ZarthaxX: love making your life harder
 ANJACE_Z: r u the undercover toad?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, eulerscheZahl = UndercoverToad
 ANJACE_Z: big fan haha
 eulerscheZahl: chat got too laggy
 Marchete: and your evil twin?
 davilla: nevermind, I guess Discord will have to do
 eulerscheZahl: is at rank 41
 Astrobytes: geheimKröte
 struct: No one wrote about the same bitboard I used yet?
 struct: Do i need to do it?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/13?u=eulerschezahl">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849/13?u=eulerschezahl</a>
 struct: not the same
 struct: that one doesnt have 3 bits padding
 reCurse: Who knows if we don't know your bitboard
 darkhorse64: Koddle also wrote something
 reCurse: I used bitboards
 struct: reCurse I just meant
 struct: Nobody wrote about it
 eulerscheZahl: so you have to do it struct
 Astrobytes: Immediately.
 struct: Im sure some people did it in a similar way
 ZarthaxX: like me that i copied you
 eulerscheZahl: collect some likes, get the philosopher achievement
 reCurse: I just literally kept this on my second monitor to do bitboards <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage">https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage</a> (click hexagon)
 eulerscheZahl: do you have to unset bits for longer shadows?
 eulerscheZahl: if yes, struct wins that round at least
 reCurse: Mask with map mask 3 times
 eulerscheZahl: i had that too
 eulerscheZahl: structs layout doesn't need it
 reCurse: But do you get neighbors for cheap
 eulerscheZahl: he does too
 reCurse: Without indexing?
 sprkrd: This is a minor achievement, my first recorded victory against euler :D: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/CLaPPTL">https://imgur.com/a/CLaPPTL</a>
 eulerscheZahl: shift my 1,9 or 10 depending on the direction
 sprkrd: It's somewhat diminished by the fact that he won immediately before, but still&#160;:)

 VRtheKing: alex = apalepex
 VRtheKing: what is this
 reCurse: Variable shifts :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: sprkrd is that UTTT?
 VRtheKing: nope I mean the input is alex and output is apalepex
 reCurse: I could be completely wrong here because predicting low-level perf is hard
 reCurse: But I think this is slower than straightforward
 sprkrd: eulerscheZahl yes
 eulerscheZahl: one of the legends i struggled the most to enter
 eulerscheZahl: that and wondev woman
 reCurse: But it was so huge
 eulerscheZahl: i'm terrible at fast code
 eulerscheZahl: in most games i can compensate to some degree with eval or search algo
 struct: maybe its not faster, I havent benched other ways
 eulerscheZahl: but UTTT is mostly about speed
 jacek: to this day i keep win against reBless in UTTT as 2p <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/536825365">https://www.codingame.com/replay/536825365</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you could still do 3 sequential shifts without the unset part
 reCurse: I don't think saving an and masking is worth it
 reCurse: It's literally already in the register too
 reCurse: shrug
 eulerscheZahl: fair enough, more of academic interest
 OldJohn: @struct you can replace *2 by &lt;&lt; 1 btw to help readiness
 derjack: oO
 Wontonimo: lol
 struct: :D
 davilla: thanks, Old John
 OldJohn: You are welcome
 cegprakash: omg eulerscheZahl had bugs in his sim
 cegprakash: nutrient bug
 cegprakash: that hurts
 eulerscheZahl: i have?
 cegprakash: "I made my simulation incorrect by not decreasing the nutrient on each cut tree. Instead I decrease it by 1 on each WAIT action."
 eulerscheZahl: it's intentional, made it easier for me to score states
 cegprakash: I see
 Marchete: I don't understand that
 cegprakash: it's minimax concept
 cegprakash: u assume opponent completes first
 cegprakash: that way u can play a safe move Marchete
 Marchete: on each WAIT?
 eulerscheZahl: if i reduce the nutrient, the other tress are worth less
 eulerscheZahl: so i don't want to sell them
 CouscousAgha: the scores wont change even after a win or loss?
 eulerscheZahl: because my sim is wrong in the first place and I give every tree the full score
 eulerscheZahl: which is stupid but i felt like not bothering with it
 reCurse: Definitely not unusual to make simulation not work the same
 struct: Are you going to write a pm?
 Wontonimo: I'm looking forward to reading the PMs
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl u used the same scoring for opponent?
 miszu: good morning children
 CaptainTraveller_2e82: Hi everyone!

 OldJohn: @Astrobytes I'm 55 and I know olders here&#160;!
 davilla: Young John it is, then
 Astrobytes: OldJohn: Yeah, there are quite a few actually!
 E_pur_si_muove: OldJohn: that's only your halftime result&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Oh another OG, great
 davilla: Original Gangster?
 OldJohn: I am old enough to know Ken Thomson, the Spracklens, Richard Lang, Richard Greenblatt... So you probably understand on which game I was competing
 Lysk: Original Gontest?
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash 04:34PMeulerscheZahl u used the same scoring for opponent?
 OldJohn: I forgot Claude Shannon also
 E_pur_si_muove: Aristotle?
 Astrobytes: Chess. Nice
 olaf_surgut: could someone downgrade my rank to 2137?
 Astrobytes: What do you mean olaf?
 derjack: such a nice number
 eulerscheZahl: just submit some bots that are worse than your current
 ZarthaxX: he is into something Astrobytes
 derjack: and we have chess on CG
 olaf_surgut: in poland its meme
 OldJohn: @derjack I saw that but I want not to infer with successfull memory in the 199x...
 Astrobytes: ah ok olaf_surgut
 davilla: Urban Dictionary to the rescue
 HoangH7: @olaf ask Elsa.
 derjack: i doubt it will be on urban directory
 derjack: or dictionary
 eulerscheZahl: Time when pope John Paul II died.
 Astrobytes: OldJohn: I think you should try it anyway&#160;;)
 derjack: pepe?
 derjack: dbd still 1st on othello :unamused:
 BrunoFelthes: why high legend take more time to process?
 BrunoFelthes: bigger games?
 Astrobytes: Most are using the full time limit for a start
 reCurse: Personally I turned off my solver because I suspected a bug with it
 Astrobytes: And thousands of games
 BrunoFelthes: hum, make sense
 reCurse: So it still takes 100ms at the end
 reCurse: RIP
 BrunoFelthes: reCurse, do you start your tree using 1s at the first turn?
 reCurse: Roughly
 reCurse: Sometimes it stops at 700ms for boring technical reasons
 BrunoFelthes: and do you reuse it for next turns?
 reCurse: Yes
 BrunoFelthes: nice...
 reCurse: Well, sort of
 OldJohn: @Astrobytes Chess is too serious. I need to be full time on it as I used to be. So only in 5/7 years with retirement
 BrunoFelthes: do you reuse with hashtables or just jumping into the choose tree state?
 reCurse: Hashtable
 Astrobytes: OldJohn: Ah. Yes, that's fair enough!
 xMizar: Hi all. Sorry for the stupid question, but which delay on the first turn are you discussing here?
 reCurse: First turn gets 1000ms
 reCurse: So you can compute more stuff for later use
 Wontonimo: is there a way world-chat-only page or tool&#160;? (other than hacking html)
 BrunoFelthes: so, each turn do you start a new tree, but this time it is faster because do you have some hashes calculated at the previous turn?
 reCurse: Wontonimo: suggested that years ago
 reCurse: I start a new tree each turn
 reCurse: It's a godawful stupid idea btw
 reCurse: Only realized it costs me much perf too late
 reCurse: Entire turns spent rebuilding tree from cache heh
 BrunoFelthes: but, for rollouts, do you use cache too? 
 reCurse: Cache all the things
 Wontonimo: gotta go, work calls
 ZarthaxX: cya wonto
 PatrickMcGinnisII: where's the final leaderboard, i'm dumb this morning

 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx

 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh it's still running the rerun?
 peerdb: almost done
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well congratz to the top coders!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: worktime
 AeroFufel: reCurse, which hardware did you use to train NN? I'm a bit sad that one needs to pay money to be competitive... kind of. Participants with an access to server power have advantages. What do you think guys?
 reCurse: I didn't pay servers
 ZarthaxX: no lol
 reCurse: Just my own computer
 reCurse: i7-8700k with RTX 3080
 jacek: at this level paying for training NN isnt neccessary
 actualCoderTrevor: Testing my new avatar...
 AeroFufel: got it, well, still ))
 actualCoderTrevor: Fail lol
 struct: no advantage
 struct: I rented and didnt move
 reCurse: Stuck on 12 cores because I don't like AMD and on the fence about 11th gen
 reCurse: Also stock issues
 struct: just wait for 12th gen
 struct: 16 cores
 reCurse: I guess
 jacek: and here i am stuck with AMD's ryzen 7 5800x
 VizGhar: I can see my ranking already
 ZarthaxX: how did it go VizGhar
 Counterbalance: 20 threads but didn't use them&#160;:(
 VizGhar: ah poorly... I came up with beamsearch in first 2 days and haven't worked on it properly after
 VizGhar: so just first half of gold&#160;:) I'll do better next time, just have to train this kind of code-writing
 KalamariKing: jacek did you just say STUCK WITH
 OldJohn: So reCurse, so you use NN and search... like aplhazero&#160;?
 reCurse: Totozero
 reCurse: But yeah pretty much
 jacek: KalamariKing in sacrastic way
 VizGhar: let him write the post mortem :P im sure he will answer everything there
 reCurse: Oh god
 OldJohn: OK then...
 VizGhar: or has he already?
 reCurse: I still need to write this
 VizGhar: :D
 reCurse: Why did you remind me
 OldJohn: and some info about totoZero&#160;?
 VizGhar: :zipper_mouth:
 reCurse: Just a lame joke with totoro, it's mostly alphazero
 jacek: with a policy?
 reCurse: Policies
 OldJohn: OK then. So in you PM you'll have to focus on the NN inputs and outputs
 jacek: robo wrote about NN inputs and outputs
 OldJohn: BTW in Othello do you use NN also&#160;?
 reCurse: Yes same pipeline except version "2.0"
 OldJohn: @jacek It may be different
 VizGhar: inputs and outputs are not that hard i suppose... I fear the training
 reCurse: "2.1" is this contest
 reCurse: Comes with small bug fixes exclusive to this contest
 reCurse: Like it does not throw away 95% of training data anymore \o/
 reCurse: (True story)
 OldJohn: @reCurse ok fine&#160;! my own othellozero implementation is not at your level. Congrat
 Astrobytes: 95%&#160;!
 ZarthaxX: VizGhar pretty good anyway!
 reCurse: Yeah I was livid when I found that bug
 jacek: what happens to the other 5%?
 ZarthaxX: i meant your performance
 VizGhar: TY ZarthaxX 
 reCurse: I am actively repressing the thought of what it would do to my uttt
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: yeah, detronize karliso
 VizGhar: mg... now everybody will try to learn NNs before next contest...
 reCurse: Circle of life
 AeroFufel: that's right... and sad
 DomiKo: will try - that's a good word
 MSmits: i would love to see your uttt improved reCurse
 OldJohn: Just follow my courses&#160;:-) Sorry only for my collegues 
 jacek: :thinking:
 MSmits: I still want to try to find a route for p2 to force a draw, dont think it exists, but a better bot can maybe find it
 VizGhar: Hmm I want to know how big is such NN code in codingame.
 reCurse: Smaller than you think
 VizGhar: shouldnt be that big right?
 jacek: code is small, weights are big
 VizGhar: just hardcoded weights and there you go
 jacek: i use 1 char per weight, resolution a little less than float16
 MSmits: reCurse if you throw away 95% of the training data, doesn't that just mean it takes 20x longer to train? Or was the thrown data not uniformly distributed?
 reCurse: Distribution problem
 jacek: and my typical NN is in range 20k-75k weights, rest is the code
 MSmits: aha
 Marchete: maybe it's better a PM than random chat questions
 jacek: a bug in buffer queue?
 MSmits: jacek might as well use 32 bit floats, or would that affect performance (simd etc.)
 reCurse: I don't know, the questions help me figure out what I should talk about
 reCurse: (I hope)
 Marchete: ahh
 VizGhar: 75k... for which contest? sounds scarry
 reCurse: I started something yesterday, then I read the PMs this morning and decided to start over
 jacek: multiplayer games
 MSmits: reCurse I know the most important question
 reCurse: I never learn
 MSmits: dreadylein wonders this also
 VizGhar: uhm in general ok
 MSmits: how did you structure the input
 jacek: MSmits i dont use avx/simd (explicitly), its just for storage. they are floats anyway
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: inputs layers, outputs, how it's the training pipeline, what kind of data (i.e. value+policy) do you export for training, rollout numbers
 MSmits: well yeah i guess output also, if it has policy
 reCurse: I am still extremely uncomfortable with giving too much details
 reCurse: Not a rational reason
 Marchete: ahh ok
 jacek: we'll give you cookie
 MSmits: no, it's ok to keep it to yourself, just throwing out options here
 OldJohn: I have to make a oneapi NN example  for the work, maybe I'll use a game for that&#160;!
 jacek: try oware
 struct: amazons
 reCurse: Why oneapi and not cuda? Just curious
 reCurse: And what's your line of work if you don't mind me asking
 reCurse: OldJohn
 OldJohn: because I have to use Intel next GPUs
 Marchete: I'm always puzzled about what to export ( policy == visits? value = NN result of value or endgame 1/0)?
 reCurse: Oh interesting
 OldJohn: And with oneapi you can use the GPUs of your 8700k
 reCurse: But is it really as fast as nvidia cuda optimized libs?
 OldJohn: NDA, sorry
 reCurse: Ok np
 reCurse: You work for/with intel?
 OldJohn: Nope but I have to benchmark V100, Mi100/mi200 and future ATS/PVC and I have to be ***fair***
 reCurse: That sounds fun&#160;:)
 reCurse: What's your line of work
 OldJohn: yep, that is the fun part of the work
 jacek: do you mine crypto in free time with those
 OldJohn: @jacek I can't sorry
 jacek: right, I believe you
 Chara98: hello
 xMizar: Sorry for the stupid question, but did i understand correctly that you implemented NN here, then export some data after each round and then tweak your parameters and weights using that output?
 Chara98: I am noob how can i be good at problem solving?
 jacek: perhaps I should try exploring those fancy libs, i made my NNs from scratch only and theyre simple
 reCurse: No, the NN is exported offline to be part of the code
 reCurse: Then it's used during the game
 bociricsi: Chara98, never stop trying
 Chara98: ok
 OldJohn: @reCurse yes it is a good idea to use tf or pytorch and then generate the good C++ code, there are plugins for that
 jacek: Chara98 try easy puzzles first <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 reCurse: Generate C++ code?
 jacek: welp you only need forward here
 xMizar: Wow, i just wrote stupid algo here, without NNs&#160;:)
 reCurse: NN is very new on CG
 KalamariKing: I was gonna write a nn, since I've got experience with those, but I decided not to
 xMizar: It's my first game ever
 KalamariKing: Contest you mean?
 xMizar: Yes
 KalamariKing: Hey same
 Marchete: you need to code the inference engine
 Marchete: you can't just import tensorflow
 OldJohn: You can generate the inference part in c++ with a plugin 
 OldJohn: without using TF libs
 reCurse: That's interesting, never heard of that
 Marchete: plugin of 8BM probably
 Marchete: MB
 Marchete: or how's the size?
 Marchete: even tflite was big
 reCurse: They usually don't optimize for source code size :P
 TBali: funny:  in the leaderboard right now only #6 is recalculating. Who is it battling with then?
 Marchete: TFLITE - good for embedded -&gt; 20MB
 cegprakash: #clash
 Marchete: wtf
 reCurse: Matchmaking is one-sided
 reCurse: Just like submits
 OldJohn: We used that in numerical simulation code where NN is doing some kind og interpolation of a complex function
 TBali: I see, thx
 OldJohn: keras2cpp for example
 reCurse: Anything for pytorch? Not big on tf myself
 OldJohn: So you add to code the game in Python first reCurse&#160;? I did not have time for that myself
 OldJohn: But you can let that in the PM&#160;:-)
 reCurse:&#160;? You don't need to run the self play in python.
 OldJohn: Ok then&#160;!
 nmortfeus: python is goat
 OldJohn: I still wonder if <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel">https://github.com/deepmind/open_spiel</a> is usable by students&#160;?
 jacek: python is reptile
 Marchete: yeah that keras2cpp seems very slim
 reCurse: I have the same relationship with python as with pythons. Stay away as far from it as possible, and when I have to it usually involves strangulation.
 OldJohn: I have the same feeling with Python, so I use Ruby as script language and play Othello&#160;!
 reCurse: I think I'll die with C++ myself
 jacek: othello in ruby? :scream:
 ThunderbirdOne: I've played with Python... I get the appeal... you can build stuff pretty quick... but man =/ it just doesnt click for me
 AeroFufel: @reCurse Did you touch Rust? I had so much hope in it and C++ still wins for some reason
 OldJohn: So enough *work* for today, time to go home&#160;!
 reCurse: Bye
 OldJohn: bye all!
 reCurse: I briefly looked at Rust
 AeroFufel: bye
 struct: cya
 reCurse: I don't see anything that compensates for the enormous loss of momentum, tooling, familiarity, legacy, etc
 AeroFufel: true true
 reCurse: Not that it's not good, but the cost is just too great
 ChadThundercode: most of the contest I was improving my C# code, and got a boost when I translated it into D :thinking:
 reCurse: If I was worried about security like I'm writing a browser though, for sure
 AeroFufel: understood
 miszu: which bot game should I go next? Othello or yavalath?
 reCurse: Time to hide
 MSmits: whats you goal miszu, what are you looking for in a game?
 miszu: well I want to practice a bot game where eval function is simple
 MSmits: Othello has some well known eval features
 MSmits: you wont be nr 1 with them, but should do well, maybe top 10
 miszu: and it's all about coding the best heuristic that takes leverage on eval
 miszu: othello is just # of your pieces
 miszu: so easy eval
 MSmits: remember, to win at almost any board game these days, you need NN or similar
 miszu: but there are some small traps
 MSmits: but you can be top 5 without NN
 reCurse: That's a strange way to misspell opening book
 miszu: you did NN?
 jacek: othello isnt about piece count
 MSmits: I can be nr 1 with opening book if i want to, i am trying to leave it out of the discussion reCurse :P
 reCurse: But that's factually wrong
 reCurse: To win you need opening book
 MSmits: sure sure
 miszu: at least in beginning for sure
 MSmits: unless noone does it
 MSmits: and almost noone does
 miszu: I'll look it up some opening books about othello and hopefully gain some ranks
 miszu: alright othello it is
 MSmits: you will notice i still have not reactivated my othello one
 miszu: you're #7
 reCurse: Part of therapy is not to look at those leaderboards
 MSmits: yes, with a simple eval miszu
 struct: you can always try amazons
 struct: jacek has NN ready for it
 miszu: oh jesus
 miszu: NN
 MSmits: miszu honestly dont worry about NN
 reCurse: This is gonna fall on deaf ears
 reCurse: NN this year is going to be the GA of 2018
 MSmits: become good enough with regular search algorithms and then if your progression is blocked by NN, then worry about it
 reCurse: Mark my words
 MSmits: you need a search for a NN anyways
 miszu: I took ML class in uni. I didn't even understood 30% of the math but finished with A- in the class
 MSmits: it's not like they just look up the move only
 DomiKo: reCurse yeah, but is this good or bad?
 DomiKo: will we have NN battles?
 reCurse: I don't know
 jacek: yeah, for now i have simple eval in amazons
 reCurse: I don't care
 MSmits: DomiKo i am not certain if it even mattered this contest
 MSmits: reCurse might very well have won with a normal algo
 MSmits: he certainly did other times
 reCurse: Oh you weren't there?
 reCurse: I said totozero
 reCurse: That's it, this is the official name of pipeline now
 MSmits: no you misunderstand
 miszu: btw, I assume C++ is the way to go with othello
 MSmits: i meant
 MSmits: if you had done a normal search
 MSmits: you might have won also
 MSmits: because you did before
 DomiKo: no, doubt
 MSmits: and other people tried NN
 MSmits: Agade and Robo
 MSmits: these guys are experienced NN players
 jacek: miszu you can learn a lot about bitboards for othello
 DomiKo: Agade and Robo know what they are doing
 MSmits: and they failed and semi-failed
 MSmits: (compared to their normal results)
 MSmits: I like the bravery of trying though, NN is very hit and miss
 miszu: jacek I know some bitboard due to UTTT. But I guess the best question is how to leverage on it
 miszu: to simplify calculations
 reCurse: Oh I see
 struct: I tried to find NN for dummies during testing
 reCurse: I don't know my patience for hardcrafting evals is nowhere near where it used to be
 MSmits: understandable, it does get old. The fact that the contests are time limited at least makes you stop 
 MSmits: locam was painful for this
 fenrir: I did an NN too but not the same algo (a policy gradient A2C like but with complete episode) but clearly not the same result than reCurse&#160;;)
 reCurse: Yeah I saw that's very cool fenrir
 reCurse: Model-free is certainly impressive
 MSmits: nice one fenrir
 reCurse: On a board game
 fenrir: it's very close than the one I have done for CSB
 slamo: did recurse post how they did it?
 reCurse: If this chat was vs code
 fenrir: for CSB I did try AlphaZero but got nowhere (dunno if its the algo, my code, bugs&#160;? ...)
 reCurse: I'd be done writing the PM
 reCurse: eh
 reCurse: Takes me forever to get in the flow
 fenrir: and so for this game I decided to not retry AZ, might have been an error&#160;;)
 TheBatMan_TM: hey guys
 TheBatMan_TM: I need help
 reCurse: I think model-free when you have the model available is a mistake personally
 struct: "It's not impossible that a 3rd event happens during the year." Please dont give me hope
 TheBatMan_TM: can any of y'all suggest a good REPL for MERN stack dev??
 DomiKo: 3rd contest :open_mouth:
 fenrir: you do some kind of AlphaZero, righ&#160;? but here I am unsure how to handle the silmutanous part. a DUCT&#160;? 
 reCurse: Yes and yes
 TheBatMan_TM: which supports multiple terminals? online
 fenrir: or you serialize maybe ...
 fenrir: ok, so it should also work on CSB
 fenrir: but I failed largely on it
 reCurse: Reinforcement learning is mostly about failures
 MSmits: fenrir your nn on csb beats every non-NN
 fenrir: I will retry on this game then, as now you are 'proof' it can work
 fenrir: th CSB bot is not an AZ but a policy gradient
 MSmits: oh you meant you failed AZ
 fenrir: (the bot I submitted I mean)
 MSmits: i see
 fenrir: yes, I failed to make AZ work on cSB
 fenrir: using MSTC + DUCT + NN value/policy
 fenrir: but so many part with potential bugs&#160;;)
 reCurse: You don't say...
 MSmits: ah yeah
 miszu: for othello just for the lolz I submitted a random bot. It is sad to see I am able to beat some players.
 MSmits: oh, thats one thing that was nice this contest, I ended with 600 lines!
 MSmits: normally 1500-2000 :P
 fenrir: I will also need to add the unicode trick to nearly double the size
 MSmits: hmm larger network also makes it slower right?
 fenrir: (and CSB seems easier, always the same actions)
 fenrir: yes, but at inference time, for a policy only one, time is not an issue
 fenrir: my bot answer &lt; 1ms
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: wow
 MSmits: why not search a little deeper?
 reCurse: Policy only
 fenrir: but a MCTS + NN, that's another story
 MSmits: oh, it's ply 1?
 MSmits: a policy only?
 MSmits: oh right
 reCurse: Model-free
 MSmits: you cant backprop anything
 fenrir: yep, policy only, that's the drawback, I cannot exploit the extra time
 MSmits: yeah, would be better with a bigger network
 MSmits: can encode policy better and use more time
 Lysk: my latest attempt with A3C on  CotC, the boat was moving in circles...
 reCurse: My uneducated opinion is muzero is a far superior approach
 reCurse: When you don't have the model
 fenrir: with policy gradient, also, it's quite tricky to not have the policy converge very fast tome something suboptimal, that's my main problem
 MSmits: when you dont have the model, azero isnt an approach at all is it?
 reCurse: No because you don't know s'
 dreadylein: 80&#160;% of reeinforced approaches are failures, but when it works they get realy strong fast, at least in my experience
 reCurse: from (s,a)
 MSmits: right... azero is better than muzero when you do have the model though. It takes less time to get the same results
 reCurse: It's debatable
 MSmits: which makes sense
 reCurse: It's entirely possible it learns a model that's more efficient to use for search
 MSmits: that's true
 MSmits: i find it amazing that within the search it's considering illegal moves :P
 MSmits: if they can even be called moves
 MSmits: and it doesnt matter as long as it leads to a good final decision
 reCurse: It is remarkable yeah
 Marchete: like seeding from tree1 in a neighbour
 reCurse: I'll surely get curious to try it at some point
 MSmits: yeah that
 Marchete: I just don't understand these moves
 reCurse: But on CG it's nonsense
 MSmits: might not be nonsense for these contest or ex contest games
 MSmits: some of them are weirdly complex
 fenrir: reCurse: for your PM, it you accept: I would love to know the number (order of magnitude, is it 10, 100, 1000, 10000) of iteration you do when you compute a node
 reCurse: Iterations to compute a move you mean?
 dreadylein: did you disclose which approach exactly you used&#160;? Sorry if you answered it allready, just came&#160;;) 
 reCurse: Totozero
 reCurse: Everyone coins terms so it's my turn
 Marchete: you aren't doing it correctly
 fenrir: reCurse: from memory, in AZ they used 2000. I am searching for the name
 RoboStac: but it doesn't have your name in it
 Marchete: it should be totomax
 RoboStac: so it can't be a real algorithm
 reCurse:&#160;:(
 MSmits: RoboStac :grin:
 fenrir: but basically the number of time you traverse the tree for update it's root value I think
 The_Auditor: people a mentioning reCurce's  PM
 reCurse: Yeah iterations to compute move
 The_Auditor: where can i find it&#160;?
 reCurse: It's in the 4 digits
 dreadylein: i think they just called it rollouts in the papers
 fenrir: reCurse: ok, thanks
 dreadylein: to keep the term inline with the mcts part
 reCurse: That literally makes no sense :P
 dreadylein: :D 
 Smelty: so contest is over?
 dreadylein: 1000 upwards mhh howmuch processing power did you use&#160;? 
 reCurse: i7-8700k with RTX 3080
 reCurse: Office was a sauna
 The_Auditor: hi reCurse , where can i find your PM&#160;?
 dreadylein: half precission interference&#160;? 
 dreadylein: hehe
 eulerscheZahl: you find it halfway finished in his text editor
 reCurse: Chat is more fun than writing a PM as usual
 The_Auditor: ^_^
 reCurse: Happens twice a year where the chat is actually riveting
 eulerscheZahl: apart from clash invites
 jacek: or escape
 The_Auditor: except i have to work . . . and then chat is gone
 Marchete: euler, jace_k, smits and robo are usually in chat
 kovi: recurzero?
 fenrir: cool now, I will have to redo my AZ implementation and understand why it was not working&#160;:)
 Marchete: they have interesing chats from time to time
 struct: How long did it took you to get rank 1 bot?
 reCurse: I did not run batches so I don't know for sure
 reCurse: But it felt like I had a hard time finding losses by wednesday if I recall correctly
 Marchete: 6 days to code and train?
 kovi: not enough games with 8-10 blocks
 reCurse: Went hardcore on thursday
 fenrir: for my AZ I used only one NN with 2 heads, maybe it is better to have 2 NN (still undecided)
 reCurse: Then started getting results um... monday or tuesday I think? They weren't that great though.
 dreadylein: do you think you the model maxed out&#160;? 
 reCurse: lol no
 reCurse: Every time I think that
 reCurse: I do something and it gets +30elo
 reCurse: So I learned to stop thinking that
 dreadylein: impressive work&#160;:) 
 reCurse: Thanks
 reCurse: I did not even put the final version actually
 reCurse: Shipping instincts
 fenrir: yes, it is impressive&#160;:)
 dreadylein: i always have the feeling the zero approaches are reeealy delicate :D they like to not converge to anything hehe
 reCurse: If it got tested enough and it works
 reCurse: Why risk it
 dreadylein: at least for me
 KalamariKing: King_Coda ping
 dreadylein: eh no way something bad happens pushing 5 minutes before the deadline ^^
 KalamariKing: King_Coda pong
 DomiKo: "Every time I think that" I guess we all got that feeling when we think that you impressed us so much, and then you impress us even more
 Astrobytes: :D
 reCurse: My best version has +50 elo over the arena version
 reCurse: :blush:
 King_Coda: STOP KALAMARIKING
 DomiKo: so you can go +10 score in leaderbord?
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: That's elo
 eulerscheZahl: trueskill has some cap
 reCurse: 50 elo is like 57%
 dreadylein: i wouldnt even be suprised if a higher iteration count would increase its elo as long as it doesent hit cellings
 eulerscheZahl: good, was about to look taht up
 DomiKo: hmm ok
 reCurse: I stopped using winrates entirely
 jacek: huh
 KalamariKing: King_Coda ping
 KalamariKing: King_Coda pong
 KalamariKing: King_Coda ping
 KalamariKing: King_Coda pong
 jacek: kick
 Astrobytes: stop it
 struct: stop spamming
 Smelty: stahp
 King_Coda: KalamariKing cease this instant
 eulerscheZahl: even at kicking reCurse beats me
 Smelty: o.O
 Astrobytes: :D
 jacek: he made NN for that
 DomiKo: :joy:
 jacek: oh, a new rule in dice duel at new league
 Smelty: wait it says i got 0 codingame points for the contest?
 delineate: Really impressive win. If you don't mind saying, what was depth/plys for the duct search part?
 eulerscheZahl: yes. sum of old and new die = 7 to capture
 DomiKo: Smelty you have to wait
 Smelty: k
 reCurse: I actually have no stats for that delineate
 reCurse: Would have to code it
 MSmits: duct does not have a fixed depth like mcts
 MSmits: afaik
 DomiKo: Can we have mirrored games in Bot version of the contest?
 MSmits: it's not like minimax
 struct: there isnt ept duct?
 reCurse: CG permanently crippled batches, I don't think they'll add more charge
 jacek: mcts doesnt have fixed depth o.O
 MSmits: ept still does not have fixed depth
 MSmits: no jacek thats what i meant
 struct: so on smitsimax you dont have fixed depth?
 jacek: hmm that sentence was ambiguousous
 MSmits: yeah was ambiguous
 MSmits: struct well, it depends on how you code it
 MSmits: duct is different though
 struct: so you cant code duct to have fixed depth?
 struct: ah ok
 struct: i dont know what it is
 MSmits: i havent coded duct, but basically you take all states combined from choices of both playes
 KalamariKing: why does mcts use random playout? wouldn't it make more sense to choose moves at least a LITTLE?
 casmith789: it uses random because otherwise how do you know which are good?
 MSmits: so it's smits with a coherent state representation (nodes always correspond with the same states)
 dreadylein: you can do it, but the mai point behind classic mcts is that you dont need domain knowledge aside of the rules
 reCurse: Random playout is terrible
 dreadylein: *main
 KalamariKing: casmith789 true
 reCurse: They need to stop teaching that
 Uljahn: vanilla mcts uses random but there are heavy playouts as well
 Marchete: then what? MCTS is based on zero domain knowledge
 reCurse: It pretends to work with zero domain knowledge
 reCurse: For me it's in the same line of thought as
 reCurse: Maybe if I keep trying random solutions I'll find the perfect one
 reCurse: In theory it will
 reCurse: ...
 dreadylein: technical correct, the best kind of correct ^^
 Marchete: then remove Monte Carlo for the name
 jacek: it still can be random. just bias some moves or prune them
 Marchete: NotSoMonteCarloTreeSearch
 Marchete: j/k I agree with the domain knowledge
 kovi: wow, i wanted to optimize vs. him, but it was more luckrecurse vs. kovi 82%
 reCurse: I wonder if euler kept all the matches this time too
 eulerscheZahl: nope, not a single one
 reCurse: aw
 kovi: and interesting not all on 8-10 block maops
 kovi: you changed something today? i had no chance before on open maps
 reCurse: I put the saturday night version back
 reCurse: Wasn't sure my fix did anything good
 kovi: i c
 reCurse: I know some things go wrong but fixing them without interfering other legit ones is...
 reCurse: Usually difficult
 reCurse: With a NN? kill me
 kovi: yeah
 reCurse: I feel like trying a new architecture to fix it
 reCurse: But
 reCurse: Might just be the contest leftover energy that usually dies out soon after
 reCurse: I just wasn't going to restart a training on last day
 MSmits: Gonna be a long time before someone beats it anyway
 jrke: congrats reCurse
 reCurse: Thanks
 reCurse: It's not even about #1 I just want to know why it's not working
 jacek: *5 years later*
 reCurse: Throwing won games is rage inducing
 jacek: ragequit
 kovi: 8th,12th,6th,4th,10th,18thwhat is next?
 reCurse:&#160;?
 fenrir: what's not working&#160;?
 jacek: kovi is this clash
 kovi: last 6 contest for me
 jacek: oh
 reCurse: It had odd games where it either plays like crap
 TBali: you don't like odd places 
 reCurse: Or it throws games that are won
 reCurse: Need better tooling to debug this
 fenrir: do you normalize your input&#160;?
 jacek: i once saw it timeouts when both players seed the same cell.
 reCurse: Yes
 fenrir: because I had an issue with that
 reCurse: The timeouts are all server hiccups
 reCurse: No crash
 fenrir: I used stats on previous run
 Marchete: you had some games with 5 seeds in the game, like wth?
 fenrir: but they were not symmetrics
 Marchete: I parsed some replays
 Marchete: must be somewhere
 fenrir: and for some games the NN was not playing right
 reCurse: I may have given too much freedom in some situations
 reCurse: No explanation for the excessive seeding
 fenrir: (mine I mean=)
 Marchete: it was a loss
 Marchete: so I imagine it doesn't matter
 reCurse: fenrir even if you're not perfectly normalized as long as you're close enough to it, should be fine
 reCurse: In my experience anyway
 fenrir: yes it should but I meant that my cell 1 was not normalized with the same coeff than cell 2 (with large difference)
 reCurse: Ohh.
 reCurse: That's a problem&#160;:)
 fenrir: because the stats collection phases was poor
 fenrir: it was just in cases (I saw it very late, no time to retrain but it explain for my bot why some maps play poorly)
 jrke: oh fenrir you ended 21st missed t-shirt by 1 ranl
 reCurse: I noticed large imbalance in some map
 fenrir: :sad:
 reCurse: Game starts and it says 20% winrate... ok...
 struct: o.o
 zhoubou: How do I get my rank in contest by language?
 reCurse: Use the filter columns on leaderboard
 zhoubou: Yeah, but it doesn't show my rank by that language specifically
 reCurse: Oh.
 reCurse: Don't think there's a way to fix that sorry
 gmessier: Count each lines :P
 zhoubou: Ah, too bad. Thanks anyways&#160;:)
 zhoubou: gmessier Lol that will take a while
 gmessier: (or pages)
 zhoubou: There are no pages (?)
 gmessier: Oh yeah, they are only in the main leaderboard I think... not in contests
 zhoubou: I would use JS but it seems it's dynamically loading the rows
 zhoubou:&#160;:/
 reCurse: You could query the API and count it in the JSON
 zhoubou: Oh, there's an API?
 karliso: reCurce Just 91% winrate? You gotta be dissapointed :D
 reCurse: I just want to know why it loses&#160;:( :P
 reCurse: API is a big word
 gmessier: The front call a back API
 reCurse: More like open the web inspector and network tab
 reCurse: Have fun
 zhoubou: Oh lol. Cool :P
 delineate: I was happy to get one win against you recurse, haha. lso, one game which blew my mind while testing was this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/557327036">https://www.codingame.com/replay/557327036</a> check out moves 9 and 22, crazy "defense"
 delineate: Also*
 reCurse: Haha nice
 reCurse: Personally I was just impressed when it started doing knight moves like the others by itself.
 reCurse: You need to set the bar low in RL
 Lucky30_: reCurse when are you planning to start streaming
 reCurse: I've retired
 struct: lol
 Lucky30_: nooooo
 Lucky30_: can i be you student
 jrke: so you did RL reCurse?
 Lucky30_: *your
 reCurse: Yes
 reCurse: To jrke
 reCurse: MSmits is a teacher maybe he takes students
 Lucky30_:&#160;:(
 Lucky30_: ok i will ask him later
 MSmits: hey, happy face, maybe i iwll
 Lucky30_:&#160;:)
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: step 1 get top 10 on csb -&gt; step 2 do NN
 MSmits: depends on how much time you're asking and what you want to know
 struct: Those are your tasks
 fenrir: btw, if not secret, on CSB, more or less the same or not&#160;?
 fenrir: (for reCurse)
 Lucky30_: can i be your student*10e30 
 Lucky30_: i want to know everying to be top 10 next contest
 jacek: notice me senpai
 pardouin: :hugging:
 Lucky30_: senpai reCurse said you will teach me if i manage to get to top 10
 MSmits: if you have specific questions i will mostly answer them&#160;:)
 GreatTux: Congrats reCurse, a league of your own really... very impressive
 MSmits: but if you find out how to get top 10 next contest, do tell me as well Lucky30_
 Lucky30_: nooo
 Lucky30_: ok what about top 50??
 jrke: bi-directional teaching
 MSmits: Lucky30_ i can mostly reach that these days, not this time though
 Astrobytes: quid pro quo jrke&#160;;)
 jrke: lemme google 'quid pro quo'
 jrke: oh latin phrase
 jacek: quidquid Latine dictum sit, altum videtur
 jrke: a favour or advantage granted in return for something.
 Lucky30_: fine by me, just teach me enough to get to top 100, and sempai reCurse would do the rest
 ClockSort: Lucky30_ i made 26th place, it was a simple matter of breaking my brain to build a simultaneous-move mcts which took 30+ hours (first time for everything is slower)
 ClockSort: took 3 days to build MC, then 4 days to upgrade it to MCTS
 ClockSort: next time will be a lot faster&#160;:)
 Lucky30_: ow my god
 Astrobytes: Well done ClockSort
 MSmits: ClockSort isnt this duct?
 ClockSort: yes it's DUCT but i didn't discover that until afterwards :D
 Lucky30_: i only managed gold ~700 with heuristics only
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jrke: i failed to get minimax working due to eval
 MSmits: the idea of the enormous branching always puts me off
 jrke: and ended up with heuristic
 jacek: MSmits practice on amazons
 jacek: :v
 MSmits: amazons duct :P
 MSmits: its sequential so wont work
 ClockSort: @MSmits i pruned all seed actions. if you have no seeds you must seed, otherwise you can't. that reduced branching to about 50 states per depth
 MSmits: oh right you mean to get used to branching
 jacek: :smirk:
 MSmits: thats not bad ClockSort
 ClockSort: 7 for p1, 7 for p2, each combination makes 49 states
 Lucky30_: you guys are soo coool
 MSmits: ClockSort what if they both seed at the same time?
 MSmits: couldnt that be 20x20?
 AntiSquid: are you really writing a guide on Mbits magic? MSmits&#160;?
 ClockSort: when seeding i required you to minimize the number of trees that could shade you if they were large trees. so the number of seed locations was typically 1-4. so taht's even fewer states (4x4=16)
 MSmits: AntiSquid yeah, summer soon, so will have time, if you can wait a month or two
 ClockSort: note: number of own-trees, not all-trees.
 AntiSquid: congratulations reaching legend in that mess btw MSmits
 MSmits: yeah thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: mess = his code?
 AntiSquid: the game
 ClockSort: yeah congrats MSmits. getting out of gold is an achievement for sure.
 MSmits: actually my code was never more neat than this time in a contest&#160;:)
 MSmits: it just wasnt very good
 struct: what is the logic for next gen on intel cpus, 8 cores + 8 cores but 24 threads
 AntiSquid: i didn't call your code messy, have no idea what it looks like apart from bit manipulation
 MSmits: only 600 lines euler
 MSmits: well if i removed the sim debugging stuff
 ClockSort: this was my first CG event using C++. It was much better than using C# last fall! Nice to not think about GC.
 eulerscheZahl: 765 lines for me
 eulerscheZahl: with some dead code
 kovi: so heur&lt;beam/mcts&lt;mcts-duct&lt;mcts-duct-nn
 eulerscheZahl: you win this golfing contest smits
 MSmits: you had some nice ideas in your beamsearch i wish i had thought of eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 kovi: gratz clocksort!
 kurnevsky: @kovi you forgot minimax&#160;:)
 jacek: and posted another approve~
 kovi: oh sorry
 kovi: heur&lt;beam/mcts/minimax&lt;...
 ClockSort: 1200 lines for me, but 400 of them were huge arrays to make calculating range and shadows easy.
 eulerscheZahl: definitely a large variety of approaches in top20
 eulerscheZahl: that's unusual
 AntiSquid: about 600 if i don't count the commented lines
 Lucky30_: guys did you share anything from your codes?? at least the structure..classes/function names.. general logic...?
 MSmits: well it seems to me that if heuristics works, every search works too, because you can just work the heuristics in there to get the same result
 kovi: i also liked dp idea...at some point i was thinking about it
 Chara98: hi
 ClockSort: @kovi congrats on top 10! That was really close, you were slipping a little in the last day. Very impressive.
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even get a notification on your approval jacek. thanks though&#160;:)
 jacek: i managed to create legal moves
 jrke: yeah approval messages are bugged i think cause i didn't get for mine also(1-2 months ago)
 AntiSquid: heuristics were quite high in this contest though so ... lol
 ClockSort: i think this contest was really good, the one thing i didn't like was sometimes-unfair start positions
 MSmits: were they really unfair?
 MSmits: because of sun direction?
 ClockSort: sometimes the sun is going to shade you first, and it can't well be avoided.
 eulerscheZahl: when i was analyzing losses and asw that i was at bottom right, i instantly skipped it
 AeroFufel: @reCurse Btw, do you use VS still or CLion? (Watched your videos, you are cool!)
 MSmits: hm ok
 reCurse: Visual Studio
 AeroFufel: thx
 Lucky30_: what video
 AeroFufel: YT
 Lucky30_: share with me please
 AndreMarasca: where

 reCurse: Can't watch it gives me the creeps
 ClockSort: i totally get that, lol
 Astrobytes: You won't believe what happens in part 2!!!! This will blow your mind!!! And change your life!!! :P
 eulerscheZahl: was that the bitstreams?
 AntiSquid: what's the issue with it reCurse? 
 Astrobytes: Of course euler
 reCurse: I don't know it gives me anxiety or something
 reCurse: The only reason is up is because I forget it exists
 eulerscheZahl: just hearing yourself. i don't like that either
 jacek: this is mostly when i read my old posts
 Lucky30_: dont delete
 AntiSquid: maybe not being familiar with streaming does that
 AeroFufel: nah, you are great!
 Lucky30_: i need your teaching
 Astrobytes: I don't know many people who are comfortable watching/listening to themselves in all honesty.
 AntiSquid: wait you intend to delete?&#160;:/
 jacek: or remind of stupid things i did in childhood
 reCurse: No I won't delete
 Lucky30_: god bless you
 struct: cant relate
 eulerscheZahl: my mom brings up these childhood stories all the time, I hate it
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 AntiSquid: cool euler, want to share some pictures with you from kindergarten or school&#160;?
 MSmits: reCurse i like it already, never watched it because my hearing is bad and i can never understand what they are saying, but now there's subtitles and that helps. I think I will watch the whole thing
 eulerscheZahl: i'll call the cops on you if you ask again
 reCurse: lol
 MSmits: i am just curious
 Lucky30_: i will watch them all
 AeroFufel: @MSmits just watch the second part, the sound is ok there!
 Lucky30_: no thinking required
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: here he is<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/R4euXNt">https://imgur.com/a/R4euXNt</a>
 MSmits: it is better than most streams
 AntiSquid: i was taking the micky astro
 MSmits: my hearing is just crap, i am a lipreader
 reCurse: He can't get over my awful accent
 Lucky30_: Astrobytes lol
 reCurse: I get it
 MSmits: no its not too bad
 AeroFufel: wow
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: so was I with the toad picture!
 Lucky30_: *you wonderful accent
 jrke: oh euler so table can also be move using arrows nice in dice duel
 Lucky30_: *your
 MSmits: i really like the video reCurse, dont delete
 reCurse: Ok I won't
 MSmits: or wait 4 hrs, to let me finish :P
 reCurse: I can get the urge to
 struct: please delete
 reCurse: But I won't
 Astrobytes: Not an awful accent at all
 jacek: i will pirate it
 MSmits: ignore struct, he is not great at deletion decisions
 struct:&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanked you in my pm btw struct, i always suck at this brutaltester crap
 struct: np
 struct: have no idea why mine bugged for you though
 MSmits: thats ok, solved it in the end, i tested everything i wanted to
 MSmits: just didnt get better ideas
 Astrobytes: Hmm. 2 notifications from jacek's dice duel approval?
 eulerscheZahl: you got 2? i got none
 jacek: i accidently deleted one
 Astrobytes: One 14 minutes ago, and another 2 minutes ago
 Astrobytes: Oh
 jacek: but why you got any notifications
 Scarfield: he stole eulers
 MSmits: eh, jacek, that means you figured out a new way to troll :P
 Astrobytes: Stop giving him ideas Smits!
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: astro didn't even leave a comment
 eulerscheZahl: do upvoters get notifications now? :thinking:
 jacek: lol <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-spring-challenge-2021-language-supremacy/190391">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-spring-challenge-2021-language-supremacy/190391</a>
 Astrobytes: I haven't upvoted or approved it euler
 Astrobytes: Upvoted now.
 eulerscheZahl: i wasn't begging for upvotes btw. just curious in what way you would be involved
 Astrobytes: The notification system is strange.
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i reported that long ago with my last contribution
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even remember what it was
 jrke: there is bug in notification even i didn't got any message for approval of night of war
 Astrobytes: It's not high priority but in the queue iirc
 jacek: clashes are higher eh
 eulerscheZahl: same for my last approved one
 eulerscheZahl: probably blockout
 jrke: damn 1000+ registered in fall under 10 hours
 eulerscheZahl: i wait with registration until i know what i'm getting myself into
 struct: damn its in all caps
 Lucky30_: people are ready for more
 eulerscheZahl: i'm ready for a break
 eulerscheZahl: happy when the contest finally starts. happy again when it finally ends
 Lucky30_: hhhhh
 jrke: cause you end with getting a t-shirt
 eulerscheZahl: because i'm exhausted
 Lucky30_: how many t-shirts you guys have
 eulerscheZahl: CG or contests in general?
 Lucky30_: both
 TBali: in general 
 TBali:&#160;:-)
 AntiSquid: maybe i do raic in fall 
 eulerscheZahl: in general a good dozen i think
 eulerscheZahl: 5 for CG (and some more that I gave to other users)
 jrke: i have one CG t-shirt in total got for organising a community not winning any
 MSmits: lol I already found something in reCurse locam stream that would have prevented a bug in the contest
 MSmits: in my case
 Lucky30_: oO :heart_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: assert?
 MSmits: directly reading input into uint8_t
 MSmits: reading it as a char
 Astrobytes: hah
 Lucky30_: lol
 MSmits: it's in the beginning of his stream, questions being asked about it too
 eulerscheZahl: what did you do? and what's the issue with it?
 jrke: gn
 MSmits: i just read the input directly into the state
 Astrobytes: gn jrke
 MSmits: and it gave the wrong number
 struct: yeah same
 MSmits: because it was read as a char instead of an int
 struct: I had the same bug
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like a C++ thing
 struct: when I was resizing state
 MSmits: if you store it in an int first, then assign it to the state, it doesnt do that
 MSmits: it is
 Lucky30_: good to know
 MSmits: but it's a c++ stream so..
 eulerscheZahl: and iostream
 Lucky30_: euler no c# for you
 eulerscheZahl: badumts
 MSmits: a lot of things from the stream i already know, but if i can prevent 2-3 bugs from watching it, it's worth it
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: :door:
 Lucky30_: no js for me
 eulerscheZahl: that i'm using C# mostly doesn't mean that I don't know C++
 MSmits: you know it better than i do
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't go that far
 MSmits: i would, it's just the bit stuff i do with it i am better at
 MSmits: i cant even make a real c++ app
 Astrobytes: Define 'real'?
 eulerscheZahl: i never dared to do any UI in C++
 MSmits: like compile something
 Wontonimo: am i dumb or do need some kind of permission to post to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2021-feedbacks-strategies/190849</a>&#160;?
 MSmits: with more than 1 file
 MSmits: .h files, includes etc.
 eulerscheZahl: should just work Wontonimo
 MSmits: never done that
 Astrobytes: Seriously? You can do that.
 eulerscheZahl: the forum is a bit buggy today, refresh the page
 MSmits: sure if i tried and took a bit
 MSmits: but never done it, just the basic CG stuff
 Wontonimo: is it the "reply" button at the bottom?
 MSmits: 1 file bots
 AeroFufel: @eulerscheZahl I tried once and "drowned"&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: yes

 eulerscheZahl: o flag?
 struct: old referee
 eulerscheZahl: right, i just used an old brutaltester
 struct: same
 Chainman: Hey
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Wontonimo is typing now
 eulerscheZahl: he found the button
 Chainman: How do I get the .jar file for the refereer for springchallenge 2021.
 eulerscheZahl: mvn package
 Chainman: I'm trying to learn how to set up brutaltester and referee now.
 Chainman: oh
 Chainman: thanks, 
 Wontonimo: Thanks eulerscheZahl!

 struct: ok
 struct: im gonna end him
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Fighting talk!
 eulerscheZahl: i see a christmas start and the word "replying..." next to it :popcorn:
 Chainman: what did he do wrong lol?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just not optimal
 Chainman: oh haha
 Chainman: oh crap
 eulerscheZahl: more a topic of academic interest than anything else
 Chainman: struct had a good bitboard.  I look forward to reading these today. 
 eulerscheZahl: right, for you it's still in the middle of the day
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's close to bedtime (also considering that i got up at 4am
 Astrobytes: Definitely some really interesting PMs this time around. Lots of approaches
 eulerscheZahl: )
 Chainman: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i like the variety
 eulerscheZahl: not like last time with 20 versions of beamsearch
 Astrobytes: I admit the game turned out slightly more interesting than I thought.
 Astrobytes: Yeah indeed.
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't like the game that much
 eulerscheZahl: just my usual reaction to board games
 Astrobytes: I don't either. Just in case you didn't see my PM :P
 eulerscheZahl: i read
 eulerscheZahl: you even tagged me
 Astrobytes: And I didn't even get a like. Shocking.
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud liked it
 Astrobytes: I only did it for reCurse tbh
 kurnevsky: I even skipped first few days because I thought it's not interesting&#160;:)
 MSmits: wait, no like?
 MSmits: hold my :beer:
 eulerscheZahl: you mean hold my &lt;3
 Astrobytes: kurnevsky: I wasn't gonna go past Bronze until euler insisted I keep going
 Counterbalance: don't you mean hold my :purse:?
 eulerscheZahl: i told you to go to legend as the boss was that easy
 Astrobytes: I gave up on Saturday though
 cegprakash: any idea why this is invalid input?

 cegprakash: my code crashes
 eulerscheZahl: i stopped on saturday too
 eulerscheZahl: and found some more motivation on sunday
 MSmits: hey, i didnt find the pm Astrobytes
 MSmits: where do i like it
 Astrobytes: I just did random tweaks on Sunday
 struct: how should i picture my bitboard
 eulerscheZahl: "cegprakash ran out of time"
 struct:&#160;:/
 struct: Its hard to represent I think
 eulerscheZahl: looks like you were too slow

 eulerscheZahl: with a 9x7 grid?
 cegprakash: no I printed Attack eulerscheZahl
 struct: oh right
 eulerscheZahl: and numbers on real game board
 MSmits: euler forced me to reach legend Astrobytes
 MSmits: know the feeling
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: "ATTACK 1 0"
 MSmits: he;s a stern taskmaster that one
 mybk: yo guys, when do they open the multi-player version of the contest&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: haven't played the game, don't know the rules. sorry. just went by the tooltip in the timeline
 Chainman: How do I see graphics, it looks like it has a webserver with brutaltester replay?
 eulerscheZahl: do you know the British TV show taskmaster?
 MSmits: nope
 eulerscheZahl: some tasks are fun to watch
 Chainman: but the link just gives me a website that says "This site cannot be reached"
 eulerscheZahl: some comedians getting tasks to solve
 MSmits: I thought you just watched John Oliver, but there is more than 1 Brit apparently
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://localhost:8888/test.html">http://localhost:8888/test.html</a>Exposed web server dir: /tmp/codingame (looks like it's working)
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Load of rubbish that show.
 eulerscheZahl: state your ground today on lastweektonight
 Astrobytes: I prefer to watch the comedians on their own.
 eulerscheZahl: watched it already
 MSmits: oh, havent yet
 MSmits: they usually just come up on my YT recommendations
 eulerscheZahl: you can shoot anyone if your feel scared
 MSmits: oh stand your ground
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't even have to be on your own property
 Astrobytes: wtf
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i wrote that wrong
 MSmits: yeah but i got it now
 eulerscheZahl: of course stand
 mybk: ...
 Chainman: nvm it works just need to remove the test.html
 MSmits: the US is weird
 Chainman: yeah
 MSmits: but funny to watch John Oliver go apeshit over it
 Wontonimo: i lived in Texas in the 80s.  yes, it's different there
 Chainman: with the referee and the brutaltester, can I play against my bot like myself.  
 Chainman: Where do you live now Wontonimo?
 Chainman: I live in Texas rn haha
 eulerscheZahl: astro on the bug channel on discord :D
 Wontonimo: it's was so exciting, i needed 3 locks on the door to keep the excitement out
 eulerscheZahl: keeping a professional calm
 Wontonimo: I live outside of Toronto Chainman
 eulerscheZahl: you can't stop the LockpickingLawyer with your 3 locks
 Astrobytes: I mean seriously, right? :D
 Wontonimo: i love LPL
 eulerscheZahl: let's do it one more time to show it was not a fluke
 Wontonimo: 3 sec later lock opens again
 Wontonimo: and that includes 1.5 sec to reach the timer on/off
 struct: this image is a bit confusing right?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/t9PLtPb.png">https://i.imgur.com/t9PLtPb.png</a>
 Astrobytes: Is this dude just one of those lockpicking maniacs or something else?
 Wontonimo: i especially like when he picks something without serious tools, like a tooth pick just to show how bad a lock is 
 eulerscheZahl: when ZarthaxX showed that to me, i had to redraw the numbers on the actual board first
 ZarthaxX: true
 ZarthaxX: i admit it was hard to visualize
 ZarthaxX: :P
 struct: Zarthaxx Draw one for me
 struct: you are an artist
 struct:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: a Zarthist
 Astrobytes: ArtHaxX
 The_Auditor: i need to read this chat for a couple of years to understand the above
 Wontonimo: that assignment is great.  "thinking outside the box".  It would take me a while to have come up with  that on my own as my first reaction is not to  have wraparound
 ZarthaxX: struct is it necessary now?
 ZarthaxX: also toad did it on the hex board
 Wontonimo: I'm not sure why it can't all be shifted 3 squares left though
 ZarthaxX: what?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/t9PLtPb">https://imgur.com/t9PLtPb</a>
 ZarthaxX: what's up with that
 Wontonimo: ^^ isn't this what we are talking about?
 ZarthaxX: yeah
 ZarthaxX: but didnt get your statement
 struct: what do you mean Wontonimo?
 ZarthaxX: hehe we are two now
 jacek: Wontonimo whats on your mind?
 struct: maybe without the numbers it becomes less confusing
 Wontonimo: i don't think it matters ... i'm just BigIndian thinking.  In the image the 34 is assigned to the 0th bit, but for some reason my mind wants to align 25 to the 63rd bit.  No, never mind my statement.  all good
 reCurse: BigIndian :thinking:
 Wontonimo: aligning it the way it is is better
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Wontonimo: big endian
 Wontonimo: ma speling is bad
 reCurse: Maybe I just had the wrong idea
 Wontonimo: i feel bad now&#160;:( 
 The_Auditor: did the majority of multi-es started as challenges&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The_Auditor: You can see the ones that did here<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 eulerscheZahl: in the first years codingame was hosting puzzle contests
 struct: cant upload image 
 struct: refresh worked
 xMistySenpai: i guess wood league is p simple when first starting
 xMistySenpai: any battles seems to have non-functional bots
 KelvinAndHubbles: was talking to a friend about the website and he decided to hop on and try the contest, he didn't even make a functional bot and just made it print "WAIT" and beat Wood 1
 eulerscheZahl: wood is to introduce you to the rules of the game
 eulerscheZahl: that sounds a bit too easy
 KelvinAndHubbles: Wood 2* Not wood 1, it's not like that bizzarely easy
 eulerscheZahl: but i can assure you that competing for top ranks is a lot more work than that
 Astrobytes: Bronze was almost as easy as that too.
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, Gold/Legend is where it starts to get fun
 Astrobytes: Not complaining though.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not talking about leagues but players
 eulerscheZahl: struct uploaded
 Astrobytes: Very nice
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/RC6GgTJ">https://imgur.com/a/RC6GgTJ</a>i really think that such a representation makes it easier to understand what's going on

 jacek: looks yavalathy
 jacek: i have 30 in center there
 struct: lol
 eulerscheZahl: struct just got a new achievement
 ZarthaxX: to p50?
 eulerscheZahl: 10 forum upvotes
 ZarthaxX: he also got  top 50 right
 ZarthaxX: :P
 struct: I think i already had top 50
 struct: due to hackathlons
 ZarthaxX: ahhh
 ZarthaxX: nvm then
 struct: it doesnt really count though
 struct: it was my first time legend and top 50
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 alchemsti: Hey, this feels like a dumb question, but I skipped out on the last day, and would like to grab the final copy of my code to play with locally. Is that currently possible?
 alchemsti: Or do I need to wait until it opens up as a bot contest?
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>

 alchemsti: Ah, thank you!
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey there.
 Littleyounes: hey
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: :wave:
 jke: struct, what value did you use to prioritize the queues? score only?
 struct: I used nth_element
 struct: and then evaluation score
 struct: i stored states in an array
 struct: store -&gt; eval all -&gt; nth_element
 struct: *store &amp; eval -&gt; after all are done -&gt; nth_element*
 CameronWatt: programming never fails to make me feel like an idiot
 jke: sorry I meant how did you calculate the evaluation score since the player score wouldn't be relevant in the first 6 turns?
 jke: I assume amount of trees, etc.
 struct: well i used the best scores to get the best N states
 struct: so i could keep searching from them
 struct: Then I would select the best that were expanded and do the same
 jke: yes but the first 6 days you don't typically complete at tree, so I am asking how the score was calculated to determine a state was better than another?
 struct: The evaluation function?
 jke: sure, sorry I don't know the names of things
 struct: my eval is similar to what other palyers descibed 
 struct: described*
 jke: ok thanks, I was curious
 jke: trying to learn
 ZarthaxX: dude is missing the r to have the same name as jrk e lol

 jacek: hm?
 Nerchio: do you guys know how to fix brutaltester Error: Could not find or load main class
 Wontonimo: did you build the supporting jar?
 Smelty: :eyes:
 Nerchio: yeah it cant find it in my ai file
 Nerchio: referee works (i think)
 Smelty: we just got this clash, everyone got 50% or below
 Wontonimo: which game are you using brutal test for?
 Nerchio: vindinium :D
 Wontonimo: i dont' see that one in the list of supported game
 Wontonimo: s
 Astrobytes: Yeah you'll need to modify that yourself to get it to work

 Astrobytes: oh nice. No idea then :P
 Nerchio: i had similar error in contest i think
 Nerchio: its not connected to wrong referee
 Astrobytes: check the chat logs?
 Wontonimo: if  you get it (or a version of it) working  then post a pull request to brutal tester to include it in the list of refs
 Wontonimo: it  looks like old code, so it may use the "old" ref
 Nerchio: :thumbsup:
 Wontonimo: try the "-o" for old option
 Nerchio: tried didnt do anything :D
 Illedan: :wave:
 Wontonimo: paste you exact command line you  are using here
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Astrobytes: hey Illedan
 Illedan: My brilliant PM is ready. xD
 Nerchio: is there something like old brutaltester or not really
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I tweak numbers in the IDE too and the lower limit really, really pissed me off 
 Illedan: But now I know
 Illedan: Time to finish that local setup
 Illedan: pff
 Astrobytes: Yeah indeed.
 Astrobytes: Almost no point to have CG IDE now
 Astrobytes: For games
 Illedan: True
 Wontonimo: reading your PM now
 Illedan: gg ddreams
 Wontonimo: i'm not following you post about the ide games being decreased
 Illedan: I guess increased fits better
 Astrobytes: and lol at the books for your little one Ille :D
 Astrobytes: Totally awesome
 Illedan: Thx to jacek for sharing an image in meme on discord :D 
 jacek: oh?
 Illedan: On Neural networks for babies
 havbro: hi
 jacek: ah
 Toadmunchers: Sup havbro
 havbro: hi
 Toadmunchers: water u doing?
 Toadmunchers: ya still there?
 Wontonimo: oh, i didn't know there were so many levels of throttling on CG Illedan.  Thanks for sharing.  i get it  now.  600 submits / 24 hours seems low during a contest
 Astrobytes: That's just IDE plays, not even submits
 Wontonimo: if they provided an easy way of running the environment locally...  
 Wontonimo: already have it all in java, so it wouldn't  be too hard I'd think
 Astrobytes: Gotta do the work yourself for that.
 Astrobytes: I liked the runner from last RAIC, wasn't perfect but it had all game modes/levels and wasn't slow
 Astrobytes: *too slow
 MSmits: still watching recurses locam stream
 MSmits: auto subtitling gets funny sometimes
 ClockSort: the one on YT?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/cEwdySV">https://imgur.com/a/cEwdySV</a>
 Astrobytes: why do you need subtitles?
 MSmits: my hearing is not great, sometimes it makes the difference
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, cool
 Astrobytes: Get a hearing aid or something, seriously. Not worth suffering.
 MSmits: i have a hearing aid, but magnifying sound isnt always enough
 MSmits: my brain is wired differently to understand speech
 MSmits: because i have been lipreading so much of my life
 MSmits: if i dont see a face I struggle a lot
 TootiFlooti: when the challenge is over I can continue to work on the bot here&#160;? I have no way of testing my bot on my own.
 Astrobytes: Ah right. Yes, I can understand that.
 MSmits: my loss is about 55 dB
 MSmits: not too bad, but just enough to cause problems 
 jacek: eeyup, i have hearing problems too or rather understanding speech. i watch english tv shows with subtitles
 Astrobytes: I have really bad tinnitus these days
 MSmits: oh thats worse, I like the quiet that comes with bad hearing
 reCurse: Anyone knows how to fix markdown pasted in forum not working in preview?
 Wontonimo: yeah, i have tinnitus also.
 MSmits: no idea reCurse sorry
 Astrobytes: Really bad sometimes. Doc is investigating potential Ménière's as I've suffered weird vertigo episodes and such too&#160;:/
 MSmits: when i wrote something big i usually used tech.io, then linked it
 Astrobytes: No idea reCurse
 TootiFlooti: anyone?
 Astrobytes: Didn't see your message TootiFlooti, sorry. The challenge should be available as a playable game again tomorrow
 Wontonimo: new evidence about tinnitus is that the recent loss at a frequency of hearing is  missed by the brain and it hallucinates it.  Same happens to your other senses if you block them for many many hours
 TootiFlooti: okay thanks 
 reCurse: That's the weirdest thing
 TootiFlooti: i really appreciate it. yall have a lovely day.
 reCurse: For those wondering, copy/pasting from VS code does not work
 reCurse: Pasting into notepad, then copy/pasting that works
 ZarthaxX: o.O
 Astrobytes: lol wot
 MSmits: hmm something to do with encoding?
 reCurse: Not kidding
 reCurse: No idea
 Astrobytes: Interesting Wontonimo. The sensory deprivation thing defo checks out.
 MSmits: sometimes if i used a file copied from Visual studio into cg bench it wouldnt work and if i made a new file and copied the code into it, it did work
 Wontonimo: after i read about the sensory depr thing, my more at peace with  it now.  Still loud as f**k,but just  doesn't really upset me anymore
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: Does this mean I can dose acid for medical reasons to restore my missing frequencies? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Wontonimo: i think you need to do lots of experiments and video record your experience
 MSmits: please include testing a tinfoil hat
 Astrobytes: Noted! :P
 Wontonimo: send me the live feed link
 Wontonimo: also, i do find that holding my nose and also trying to force air out of  it at the same time (like what you do when an airplane is landing to repressure you ears) helps a little.
 Astrobytes: I had an 'episode' earlier, just sat here and tinnitus became reallyyyy loud, you get a panic response from your brain and typical adrenaline response. Weird dizzy feeling. I don't get the vertigo any more and that's the first one for ages.
 MSmits: if the sound is coming from your brain, then that may not be a good idea
 Astrobytes: Yes, the nose pinching works now and then.
 MSmits: vertigo, is that when room spins?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 MSmits: and it gets worse when you lie down?
 Wontonimo: the best thing that works for me is to NOT focus on it, don't feed the hallucination
 MSmits: had that 1 time in my life, that's really panic inducing if it never happened to you before
 Astrobytes: I never do. But in that case where it's as I described it's not ignorable. Fills your ears.
 Wontonimo: i hope you find something that works!   I've only  had something mildly  like vertigo a couple times in my  life.
 MSmits: it just came up 1 day, took about 2-3 hrs, then went away
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits. Think of that but without the spin. Just everything else and the worst ear buzzing ever.
 MSmits: weird
 Astrobytes: Was your hearing affected at all MSmits?
 MSmits: nah i was born with my handicap
 MSmits: it never changed after that
 Astrobytes: But at the time I mean
 MSmits: oh, hmm, hard to say, i was alone at home, watching tv
 MSmits: was too focused on the spinning
 MSmits: its so weird
 Astrobytes: It's a truly bizarre experience yeah.
 jacek: sounds like hypnagogia before the sleep
 Astrobytes: Nah that's good unless it's paralysis
 Astrobytes: *sleep paralysis
 Astrobytes: I like my lucid dreaming
 jacek: im keen on lucid dreaming, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's awesome. I do the best in early morning.
 MSmits: a few times it happened to me that i snored or something, just before i fell asleep and it seemed an extremely loud noise that shook me up and got me wide awak
 Counterbalance: Astrobytes ever had an oobe?
 MSmits: wtf was that!!
 MSmits: kinda funny
 MSmits: oobe?
 Astrobytes: Yes Counterbalance, but it wasn't from lucid dreaming . . .  :zipper_mouth:
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/windows/configuration/wcd/wcd-oobe">https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/windows/configuration/wcd/wcd-oobe</a>
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-body_experience</a>
 Astrobytes: Came pretty close when I was into meditation and stuff a few years back though. Amazing what you can do with your mind.
 Counterbalance: yeah, it's incredible&#160;;)
 MSmits: how much weed you need for this?
 Counterbalance: I have them very sporadically but as soon as I realize I'm dreaming I jolt awake
 jacek: nah, its just more sophisticated lucid dream when you try to keep conscious while falling asleep. more realistic with more leaving the body sensations
 Astrobytes: Which is achievable by numerous methods. Weed is not one of them (not in my experience at least!)
 MSmits: you mean you havent tried weed, or you treed it with weed and it didnt work
 jacek: weed supress REM state. could use that for REM rebound in next  nights
 MSmits: thats important you know
 Astrobytes: Weed and I don't get along these days. It's ridiculously strong and bad for you.
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: haven't ever tried it myself
 MSmits: not even a cig
 Astrobytes: Plants bred for THC content alone are the worst. It's a finely balanced herb in natural form.
 snoyes: Talking of seeing things that aren't there, perhaps you'd like to see if <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/657661704b0fdc034a635fa4aa2d0b61193f">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/657661704b0fdc034a635fa4aa2d0b61193f</a> is within your scope
 Wontonimo: legal here in Canada ... finally
 CameronWatt: O_O
 MSmits: I bet they go together well with your tacos
 Astrobytes: Some nice low-thc stuff would be cool, all I need
 Wontonimo: weird, now that you mention it
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I was a massive stoner for years (functioning stoner) but the strength was just getting ridiculous
 Counterbalance: just use less weed then
 MSmits: just dilute it with some grass
 Astrobytes: Tried that. The high is still very different.
 MSmits: but smells like freshly mown lawn
 Astrobytes: I prefer psychedelics.
 Astrobytes: Phosgene MSmits?
 Counterbalance: who doesn't :D
 MSmits: stop making me google stuff
 MSmits: dude, that's a biological weapon :P
 MSmits: I said grasss!
 Astrobytes: chemical weapon
 MSmits: wait ok, now it all makes sense :P
 MSmits: grass is biological though
 MSmits: I'm so confused now
 Astrobytes: well phosgene is an organic compound, used as a gas, that smells like grass
 MSmits: aha
 Wontonimo: GrAsS
 MSmits: so when you put grass in your weed you get paranoid and think it's WW 1?
 Wontonimo: that's why you connect your gas mask to your bong
 MSmits: makes sense
 Astrobytes: RoentgeniumArsenicSulfur Wontonimo?
 jackthrow893: anyone selling PHP? 
 MSmits: wait, is this a drug jackthrow893?
 MSmits: we dont sell drugs here
 Astrobytes: (I took a liberty with the Gr/Rg but hey)
 MSmits: wrong channel
 KillaManDan: im selling http
 KillaManDan: :smirk:
 therealbeef: or swift
 Wontonimo: lol Astrobytes
 MSmits: jackthrow893 go here #TheGoodStuff
 Illedan: reCurse, how many policy outputs did you have for each player?
 reCurse: "two policies, one per player"?
 jacek: hell write this in his pm
 Illedan: he posted it
 Astrobytes: Read it jacek
 jacek: oO
 Illedan: How many actions did each policy contain, is the better question I guess
 reCurse: 1 per cell
 Illedan: k, thx. Great PM.
 reCurse: Thanks
 struct: recurs e ever tried implementing NN for 3+ player game?
 reCurse: No, if this was done as a multi-player game I'd probably be screwed
 Astrobytes: muzeroCurse coming for Fireworks multi struct
 reCurse: I still have no idea I'm comfortable with for multi-player
 Astrobytes: Excellent, thorough PM man, good read.
 MSmits: do not seed next to your tree is not a safe prune reCurse, sometimes this is useful
 Notaboredguy: uhh
 Notaboredguy: how do you convert float to integer in lua&#160;:))
 MSmits: so not pruning too much is prolly good
 Saelyos: Congrats reCurse, thanks for your PM&#160;:) 
 reCurse: Thanks, you're welcome&#160;:) Congrats on your own rank too, definitely deserved!
 delineate: Nice/interesting write up, thanks recurse. do you have recommendations of the best ml frameworks, like pytorch or something else?
 jacek: so this is convolution net after all
 reCurse: I personally love pytorch
 MSmits: good PM reCurse&#160;:)
 reCurse: Reading tensorflow code makes my head hurt
 MSmits: I like the fact that you put a short history before the PM
 MSmits: good for people to know that it didnt come out of nothing
 Astrobytes: Some people pay their dues and respects&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: yeah, the history is great.   level setting
 reCurse: For me it's mostly about being honest
 Illedan: I love your failure in Silver :joy:
 Astrobytes: Which is always a refreshing thing these days.
 jacek: yeah, i think at this point the good 'RL pipeline' is more than NN
 jacek: important*
 MSmits: what is verification through disassembly&#160;?
 Astrobytes: literally about to type that!
 reCurse: I verified the generated assembly was not stupid
 reCurse: Making function calls where it shouldn`t
 reCurse: etc
 MSmits: I see, do you run into that sometimes coding bots for CG?
 Astrobytes: right, godbolt time
 reCurse: Definitely
 MSmits: hmm
 reCurse: Sometimes you want to code clean
 reCurse: And it turns out it no longer wants to inline things for whatever reason
 reCurse: For a hot loop like NN inference it's not acceptable
 MSmits: is it safe to assume the CG compiler will do the same thing as the godbolt thingy?
 reCurse: If you use the same version of g++ with -O0 most likely
 Astrobytes: If you set it correctly yes
 MSmits: I see, i should use that more often
 dbdr: you should use a profiler
 MSmits: well i sometimes use VS for that
 Astrobytes: That too ofc
 dbdr: that shows you the assembler
 dbdr: then you only look at parts that are actually relevant
 reCurse: vtune
 Counterbalance: had to install vtune as vs profiler is broken
 MSmits: never seen that, I just look at cpu time&#160;%
 Astrobytes: vtune is what struct uses right?
 reCurse: Unfortunately I refuse to switch to linux
 dbdr: cpu time at the assembler instruction level
 jacek:&#160;!
 reCurse: So I profile with clang on windows and hope it's similar
 struct: vs profiler somtimes is hard to tell whats hapening
 reCurse: msvc is absolutely garbage with avx2
 reCurse: For some reason
 Astrobytes: MSmits: the memory view in the VS debugger can be quite handy
 MSmits: oh, what does it do? I mean in my CG bots i usually already know how much memory i use because i reserve it
 MSmits: does it show cache efficiency somehow?
 struct: vtune does
 struct: cache hits and such
 MSmits: nice
 Astrobytes: vtune is much more feature-rich
 Counterbalance: I'm still wondering how you combined DUCT with the NN. Did you do DUCT and use the NN to calculate a score (win chance)?
 Wontonimo: oh i know i know ...
 Wontonimo: check out the AlphaZero architecture and pipeline
 MSmits: gonna take off and see if i can apply some of those sleep experiments you guys were discussing earlier, gn!
 Counterbalance: okay i'll rtfm&#160;;)
 Counterbalance: nn
 Astrobytes: gn MSmits :D
 Wontonimo: hey MSmits , 
 MSmits: hey?

 Wontonimo: a trick that works for me for remembering dreams and sometimes realizing i'm dreaming
 Astrobytes: hay - phosgene again
 Wontonimo: is to start a task (even  just drinking a glass of water) and 
 jacek: look at your hands or clocks - theyre werid in dreams
 Wontonimo: then when you wake up immediately finish it
 MSmits: this sounds like you fall asleep halfway through a glass of water and let the rest fall on your face Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: you are asking you mind for immediately continuity before and after waking up ... which means not forgetting
 struct: Anyone has any articles on duct mcts?
 Astrobytes: That's how Wontonimo sleeps. Covered in tacos and water.
 reCurse: I posted the paper struct
 MSmits: apparently
 struct: thanks ill check
 MSmits: anyways thanks for the... advice Wontonimo , gn now&#160;:)

 Wontonimo: could be a rubik's cube
 Wontonimo: have fun!
 Wontonimo: i used to have a water bed, so not far   from the truth
 Astrobytes: What is it about programmers and water beds.
 Wontonimo: can you even buy those things anymore?
 Astrobytes: Probably in some modern form
 struct: thanks ill try to understand it when my brain recovered
 Astrobytes: Very peculiar things they were
 Chainman: what does this error mean?   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2
 Chainman: When I"m trying to look at the logs with the referee
 Chainman: in web app
 Chainman: oh do I Need to use Eclipse or intellij?
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game</a>
 Notaboredguy: can you send the code
 Chainman: I know the bot program works locally
 Chainman: I mean it worked in the game
 Chainman: not locally
 Chainman: I'm running this command "java -jar ~/github-repo/AIGame/spring-2021.jar -p1 python3 ~/github-repo/AIGame/heuristics.py -p2 python3 ~/github-repo/AIGame/heuristics2.py -l ~/github-repo/AIGame/logs/game1.json -s -d seed=-92039809419061936"
 Counterbalance: add quotes: -p1 "python3 ..../heuristics.py"  
 Counterbalance: -p1 and -p2  take 1 argument, the program, which should be "python yourfile.py"; instead, it just runs python without a script which then executes the referee input 0 3 1 etc as a script. Make sense?
 Zenoscave: Is it not available in multi?
 Zenoscave: the last contest i mean
 Chainman: tomorrow they said
 Zenoscave: got it
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew
 Zenoscave: pewpewpew
 Astrobytes: where did you finish in the contest zeno?
 CamTheHelpDesk: anyone else having problems where they're not getting achievements?
 Astrobytes: Should be good by tomorrow at some point
 Zenoscave: 201st&#160;:/
 CamTheHelpDesk: will we get achievements we've earned but that didn't show up?
 Astrobytes: Yes. Most likely. To which achievements do you refer, specifically?
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: better than me :P
 Zenoscave: I had almost the same bot as euler. just different eval weights and no decay factor on sun
 Zenoscave: Eval scoring was huge in this game
 Astrobytes: decay factor seemed to be helpful for a few
 Zenoscave: I should have thought of how to code it but had a block until this morning
 Zenoscave: Was recalcing base score each sim rather than doing additive on move changes
 Astrobytes: I gave up after the server issues on Saturday, lost all motivation
 Astrobytes: ouch
 Zenoscave: Just one more day and I could have probably had top 100. or at least top 200&#160;;)
 CamTheHelpDesk: &gt; to which achievements do you refer, specifically?
 CamTheHelpDesk: got 100% on both
 Astrobytes: And which achievement is not showing up? You didn't get the XP for it?
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: "Just one more day" - literally all contests every for anyone :D
 Zenoscave: lol true enough
 Astrobytes: *Ever for anyone
 Zenoscave: for everyone would work as well&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: everyone I was just coming with yeah
 Astrobytes: I'm tired, lemme be :P
 CamTheHelpDesk: &gt; And which achievement is not showing up?
 CamTheHelpDesk: it's like that for both
 Zenoscave: I'm not singing words of wisdom. I will not let it be
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: CamTheHelpDesk: I can't even remember what those achievements are!
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I gotta sleep. Gn all
 CamTheHelpDesk: sleep well
 Chainman: gn
 Chainman: ahhhhh "python3: can't open file '/home/therealchainman/github-repo/SpringChallenge2021-referee/~/github-repo/AIGame/heuristics2.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory"
 Chainman: idk why I can't get the referee to work
 Chainman: anybody can help me with running springchallenge 2021 on intellij? 
 Chainman: This doesn't seem to be up to date with intellij <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game</a>
 Smelty: o.O
 Chainman: Import Project &gt; Select game-tictactoe &gt; Import project from external model &gt; Maven
 Smelty: hm
 Chainman: this part doesn't make sense
 Chainman: I don't have an option to do that with maven
 Smelty: idk
 Chainman: yeah same 
 Smelty: "starting in null"
 xMistySenpai: Think I may have found a bug in crystal rush
 xMistySenpai: 3rd arena match my script is played in, ends on round 168 suddenly, score 72 to 64 and he wins?
 xMistySenpai: either, a bug, or my script is really taking over 50ms to output next set of commands
 xMistySenpai: nvm all fixed, derp me
 Smelty: oh?
 Smelty: well in the future i guess just output the time it took in error stream so you can tell
 xMistySenpai: well, it'd cut out by then and the time could take a variable length
 Smelty: hmm yea
 CamTheHelpDesk: anyone know precisely what time rankings are recalculated?
 struct: Its around this time
 CamTheHelpDesk: hmm ok
 CamTheHelpDesk: is there a server restart or smth
 struct: nah
 Wontonimo: i'm very excited to see my new ranking ... i'm hoping for 625th
 CamTheHelpDesk: quick question for all you mods: are you volunteers or codingame staff members?
 struct: volunteers
 CamTheHelpDesk: cool
 CamTheHelpDesk: good luck Wontonimo!
 Wontonimo: thanks
 struct: I have no idea how much I will climb
 struct: I probably will get like 9k points from the contest
 struct: and then 4.5k+ from the multi when it comes
 reCurse: Hope it answers your questions AntiSquid
 Wontonimo: yeah, that sounds about right
 CamTheHelpDesk: oh wow impressive stats reCurse
 CamTheHelpDesk: congrats
 reCurse: Thanks
 CamTheHelpDesk: you seem familiar... did you win the competetion today?
 Chainman: why server restart?
 reCurse: Yes
 Chainman: did anybody here get the spring challenge referee work in web app?
 Wontonimo:&#160;??
 Chainman: tororo
 Chainman: totoro I mena
 Chainman: did you Wontonimo?
 Project-Magenta:&#160;??
 Counterbalance: Chainman yes - you have to copy the fiiles in src/main/resources/view/assets  to a new directory src/main/resources/view/assets/assets/, then rebuild
 Chainman: oh
 Chainman: "java: package com.google.inject does not exist" this is the error
 Chainman: but there are a lot of error when I try run I think.
 Counterbalance: are you running it in an IDE?
 Chainman: intellij is what I'm trying now
 Counterbalance: hm.. for eclipse you could run mvn eclipse:eclipse and then import the project.. for intellij, idk.. if it has a maven plugin or something you could import it as a maven project?
 Wontonimo: i stepped away Chainman.  I didn't try
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html#maven_import_project_start">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html#maven_import_project_start</a>
 Chainman: what about without an ide?
 Chainman: I was trying that earlier
 Counterbalance: mvn package
 Chainman: okay but I was getting a weird error there as well
 Counterbalance: but you'll need one of the forks that offers the commandline interface
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 Chainman:&#160;?
 Chainman: I'm using that
 Counterbalance: yes that one will work
 Counterbalance: are you running java 15 or something?
 Counterbalance: what error? some reflection error?
 Chainman: java 1.8
 Chainman: so I use the command line for p1 and p2
 Chainman: and it seems to work I check the logs game1.json files and it shows outputs
 Chainman: how do you see the replay in web app with cli?
 Counterbalance: run that command with -s
 Counterbalance: then open browser on url <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a>
 Chainman: huh
 Chainman: that swaps player position I think 
 Counterbalance: only in brutaltester
 Counterbalance: in referee commandline it means 'start server'
 Chainman: oh I'm using brutaltester I guess
 Chainman: not sure about referee cli 
 Counterbalance: you can't view the replays from the logs, unfortunately. You'll have to run the game again with the -s and specifying a seed to view that replay..
 Chainman: I don't see any docs on cli for referee
 Counterbalance: just run it without arguments, it shows help
 Counterbalance: java -jar spring...jar
 Chainman: ooooh thanks, it finally worked
 Counterbalance: nice!
 Chainman: I see I just did java -jar target/spring-2021.jar -h 
 Chainman: to see the commands for it haha
 Chainman: I realized whoever made it added the commandlineinterface class to the referee so it had some commands
 Chainman: I could see them from source code of referee as well., thanks Counterbalance
 Counterbalance: np
 Chainman: wait the graphics are messed up though? it doesn't have the trees.
 Chainman:&#160;:(
 Counterbalance: yeah that's what the copy resources thingy above was for
 Smelty: o.O
 Smelty: oof
 Counterbalance: got it working?
 Xwtek: iid|id
 Chainman: oh, got distracted with something
 Chainman: I think I did the copy resources, let me check again
 Chainman: cause yeah the graphics are all weird
 Chainman: I did that Counterbalance but it's even worse, just black screen almost
 miszu: for bitboarding a board of 64 squares, would it be wise to use __int64_t?
 reCurse: uint64_t
 miszu: thank you!
 Wontonimo: I see CP has been awarded.  Cool, new ranks!
 Chainman: what's cp?
 samcmullin: I'm a noob, can somebody explain how to read this constraint? 2&lt;=num_bounds&lt;=1000&#160;?
 samcmullin: just started using these types of sites&#160;:\
 MoMaT: like in normal mathematical expression?
 MoMaT: number between 2 and 1000, inclusive
 samcmullin: i guess, like when i' coding my solution whats that mean? no number can go number 2 or lower? and no number can be higher than 1000?
 samcmullin: so it has to be between 2 and 1000?
 MoMaT: usually its about the expected input, so there are no surprises.
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo nice rank :O
 ZarthaxX: almost 666 :P
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'm reduced to player CoC to get to 666 lol
 Wontonimo: watcha doing at this late hour after a competition ZarthaxX?
 ZarthaxX: im always chilling haha
 ZarthaxX: not necessary on cg
 Wontonimo: (i think i just messed up my CoC rank)
 ZarthaxX: rn im watching some backend video because i have an interview tomorrow
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Wontonimo: Good luck!
 ZarthaxX: the previous one to this one was in middle of contest
 ZarthaxX: ty :D
 ZarthaxX: i want to do multis tho
 ZarthaxX: contests always leave me with that will lol
 Wontonimo: multis? the bot programming?
 ZarthaxX: right
 ZarthaxX: also so close to top 100
 ZarthaxX: i should just do it
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: have been like this for years
 Wontonimo: funny how that goes ... always chasing the next number.  i have that also
 ZarthaxX: wdym=?
 ZarthaxX: rank? :P
 Wontonimo: yeah, i have that want to chase the next rank
 ZarthaxX: ah right
 ZarthaxX: i want to get top 100 because that's guru
 ZarthaxX: and i become orange in rank haha
 ZarthaxX: just to match everything
 Wontonimo: nice
 Wontonimo: the motivation is colour, i respect that
 ZarthaxX: nah haha
 ZarthaxX: i feel like its about time for me to be higher
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Wontonimo: i can just imagine that coming up in your interview.  "So tell me some of your accomplishments"  "I became orange on CG"
 ZarthaxX: anyway when  multi comes out i will prob get it automatically
 ZarthaxX: exactlyyy
 ZarthaxX: *just in time*
 ZarthaxX: *oh man hired!*
 Wontonimo: btw, do you ever bring up CG in interviews?
 ZarthaxX: i have
 ZarthaxX: when it's possible to
 ZarthaxX: i jsut comment hey its a cool platform
 ZarthaxX: great games
 ZarthaxX: i mention my avatar if they want to contact me
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: i dont flex obv
 Wontonimo: but why not, if you can't flex in an interview then when can you?  
 ZarthaxX: it wouldnt sound humble
 Wontonimo: maybe culture difference in the interview.  
 ZarthaxX: i guess
 ZarthaxX: its my first try at a job
 ZarthaxX: im not sooo experienced
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Wontonimo: oh, okay, i get you.  I would totally  talk up how much effort you put in, how dedicated you've been over the years, what very challenging problems there are 
 Wontonimo: and not mention the word "game" or "cool"
 ZarthaxX: mmhm
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: maybe i will tomorrow
 ZarthaxX: it sgonna be an hour with technical people
 ZarthaxX: so i can show my motivation for learning
 ZarthaxX: :P
 Wontonimo: dude, you have kicked ass.  Well, you kicked my ass 
 ZarthaxX: "i kicked wonto's ass!"
 ZarthaxX: i kicked some
 ZarthaxX: but it's average for my rank/lvl i guess
 ZarthaxX: could be way better
 Wontonimo: but your rank/lvl isn't average.
 Wontonimo: anyway ... what's the postion?  full stack or something?
 ZarthaxX: i meant that i feel like i should be way higher given my global rank
 ZarthaxX: but i gotta value myself more i guess
 ZarthaxX: i tend to feel im bad at everything
 ZarthaxX: it's backend
 ZarthaxX: with java/go
 ZarthaxX: it's 2 months of an IT Bootcamp where they teach us and then we enter some area within the company to work seriously
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: dude, I'm here eating humble pie.  I've got 26 years of professional experience in coding, been coding since i was 8, and young guys like you are kicking my but.  Be proud, at least to make me feel better
 ZarthaxX: you gotta admit tho that this is a different skill than normal work
 ZarthaxX: really different
 ZarthaxX: but thanks for that, i will&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: backend and CG competition achievement is a great fit.  Backend is all about optimization, moving data, reversing stuff
 ZarthaxX: i just feel that it's irrelevant to show off on an interview, but i DO actually include it on cv
 ZarthaxX: lik "hey this is my rank globallly, 1st in argentina, best rank ever 28 out of 2500"
 ZarthaxX: smth like that
 ZarthaxX: yeaahhh i like backend because of that
 ZarthaxX: like the algorithmic part of it&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: thanks for the support wontooo &lt;3
 Wontonimo: first interviews?
 ZarthaxX: with this company or ever
 Wontonimo: if you think of interviewing like dating, it will go a lot better.  A lot of people who go into interviews like it's this formal thing and they act all stiff and wait for things to happen.  If instead you think of it as a date it goes a lot better.  On a date you are trying  to be yourself, but you also have to get to know him/her.  You ask about that picture on his/her desk, make eye contact, try to slip in a funny joke when appropriate
 Wontonimo: ah ... sorry for the unsolicited advice
 ZarthaxX: hahaha
 ZarthaxX: the last part was funny
 ZarthaxX: its ok thanks for the help
 Wontonimo: have you done any NN bots on here?
 ZarthaxX: i had an interview once when i got into a school as a teacher, but that was a meme 
 ZarthaxX: and then i had 3 interviews with a security company
 ZarthaxX: they said they were very happy with me, i even metnioned codingame to the last dude and he really cared of how this workedl ol
 ZarthaxX: but the chat with those guys was super smooth and cool
 ZarthaxX: this is the first interview related to backend, that's the main diffrence
 ZarthaxX: to programming itself tbh, because security is not directly programming
 Wontonimo: some ppl are good at giving interviews and some are just  azz
 ZarthaxX: and no, i havent done NN
 ZarthaxX: havent messed with ML ever
 ZarthaxX: im scared
 ZarthaxX: but i want to lol
 ZarthaxX: haha
 ZarthaxX: the thing is, i was calm back then because i didnt care of that job
 ZarthaxX: i just tried but had 0 experience in security and they were not looking for ajunior
 Wontonimo: funny story, i do NN and ML at work, i'm actually the lead and yet I haven't applied it here.  wtf up with that eh?
 ZarthaxX: but in this one iREALLY want to get in
 ZarthaxX: so it puts extra pressure
 ZarthaxX: i know, you told meyesterday haha
 ZarthaxX: it's ironic actually :D
 Wontonimo: that's a tough  spot
 ZarthaxX: i guess you will
 ZarthaxX: i will give you one year
 ZarthaxX: you will be smashing
 Wontonimo: (geez, these last couple days have been a blur.  sorry for repeating myself)
 ZarthaxX: its ok
 ZarthaxX: one loses notion of time while in a contest
 Wontonimo: i think of myself as good at interviewing.  I've changed jobs about 30 times in 26 years, and usually with 0 break inbetween.  But even still, getting a job has quite a but of random chance to it that is completely outside of your control
 Wontonimo: someone else may also apply at  the same time with +5 yrs experience with all buzz words checked off.
 Wontonimo: or they may have a budget cut right after interviewing and not be able to hire anyone
 ZarthaxX: oh god 30 times??
 ZarthaxX: thats more times than years working
 Wontonimo: yeah, about 8 months is my 'usual' length of employment
 Wontonimo: i get bored 
 ZarthaxX: and that's what scares me too, a better candidate showing up haha
 ZarthaxX: luckily on this one juniors have a big chance
 ZarthaxX: the requisite is to have &lt;=3 years of software dev
 ZarthaxX: like, work soft dev
 ZarthaxX: 8 months damn, you know, i also fear getting bored
 ZarthaxX: it gets annoying to change jobs all the time tho, right
 Wontonimo: that's  really cool.  is there a gov program in Argentina  that supports employers in this way or somthing
 Wontonimo: no, i really like changing jobs.
 ZarthaxX: not that i know of
 ZarthaxX: thing is this company is actually doubling their employers size
 Wontonimo: you see a lot  of new ways of doing this, and can bring your previous experience to the table 
 ZarthaxX: 16k -&gt; 32k
 Wontonimo: oh, that's a lot  of employees
 ZarthaxX: so they have this IT Bootcamp program where they are recruiting a lot of people
 ZarthaxX: i know of many from my uni that have got into it through this program
 ZarthaxX: yeah, its a mix of programmers and other kind of jobs obv
 ZarthaxX: but i guess a big proportion is of programmers
 ZarthaxX: its an amazing oportunity, great company
 Wontonimo: i remember my boss in 1998 saying that after the Y2K bugs are fixed that programmers are going to all be out of jobs
 Wontonimo: and now there are bootcamps to help as many people into the field as possible  to the endless work
 ZarthaxX: what is that?
 ZarthaxX: luckily haha
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem</a>
 ZarthaxX: ohhh okey
 ZarthaxX: that one was in a simpson's chapter
 ZarthaxX: lol
 Wontonimo: on Dec 31 1999 the next day was going to be Jan 1 1900
 Wontonimo: it was a huge deal.  Seriously  huge.  Power plants were going to stop working.
 ZarthaxX: i havent read how it was solved
 Wontonimo: I remember a live news coverage of a power plant in the US saying they have solved their issue and to prove it they are going to turn their computer clocks forward 1 year.  It shut down their grid for a few days
 Wontonimo: we solved it line by line, program by program
 ZarthaxX: o.o
 ZarthaxX: holy f
 Wontonimo: basically, all other work stopped for about 2 years prior
 ZarthaxX: ah but back then there was so much embedded systems going on right
 ZarthaxX: it was easier
 ZarthaxX: ok 2 years nvm&#160;:
 ZarthaxX: D
 Wontonimo: some companies just said f-it, we are just going to turn back the clocks of our computers every night 1 day and stay in  1999
 Wontonimo: i kid you not
 ZarthaxX: doing that every day sounds so shit
 Wontonimo: fun times.  lots of doomsdayers prepared for the end of civilization
 ZarthaxX: and i was just a baby back then
 ZarthaxX: little did i know
 ZarthaxX: i mean it would be a disaster rn
 ZarthaxX: back then it would have been, but not as much

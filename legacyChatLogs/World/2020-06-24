 WINWINWIN: Any reason why the .�� diamond symbol is printed to stderr?
 Raghu0214: i have no idea
 BigBadOctopus_af5d: I have 2 problems about programing.Can someone help me?
 Raghu0214: what
 Raghu0214: can anyone allow me send messages in disord

 Raghu0214: anyone can jion
 Raghu0214: i mean join
 manan_ali23: ok
 Raghu0214: then great
 manan_ali23: I need team of 3 members to participate in it
 Raghu0214: i have none
 Raghu0214: what is harshad 
 Raghu0214: help
 manan_ali23: where you from&#160;?
 Raghu0214: india
 manan_ali23: Have u completed your graduation
 Raghu0214: no
 Raghu0214: i am 13
 manan_ali23: Okay.am 23
 manan_ali23: are u a developer?
 Raghu0214: no
 manan_ali23: You like programming then?
 Raghu0214: yes
 manan_ali23: I have  some programming problems for you 
 manan_ali23: Can you solve them?
 Raghu0214: yes
 Raghu0214: in C++
 manan_ali23: yes
 manan_ali23: But its a multinational interview question
 manan_ali23: Your gmail??
 DieuMQ: hello 
 manan_ali23: hello
 Raghu0214: no need
 imbadpython: they fixed clash of code :O
 imbadpython: it shows pending and submission results now! :D
 imbadpython: i think for shortest code it should hide the code size
 imbadpython: cuz then it fforces people to do as well as they can
 imbadpython: but
 imbadpython: n i cc e
 imbadpython: nice
 demen: Ye
 rak1507: I disagree, it's nice to know what you're competing with in shortest
 rak1507: And it's funny to see people submit with like, 500
 Raghu0214: Hi
 Raghu0214: i am back
 imbadpython: ye like show it when you submit
 imbadpython: but like
 imbadpython: not in the round
 imbadpython: idk
 Raghu0214: what
 imbadpython: so like in the game rn you can still see 
 rak1507: yeah I can see you got 180 
 imbadpython: someone submitted and got a 100% 180char let's say
 imbadpython: ye
 imbadpython: you shouldn't be able to see that
 imbadpython: you should only see someone submitted and (perhaps) the score as well but not the char count
 imbadpython: so you try to optimise it as much as you can 
 imbadpython: and not just "optimise till 179"
 imbadpython: yk
 rak1507: I fail 4 but pass the rest 
 rak1507: damn
 rak1507: how does Do have a higher average than i
 rak1507: i is 105, Do is 89.5
 LelouchVC2: i = 105. 105/1 = 105
 LelouchVC2: D = 68. o = 111. 68+111 = 
 LelouchVC2: 179. 179/2 = 89.5
 imbadpython: ruby gay anyways
 rak1507: ruby is best golf lang
 LelouchVC2: maybe you meant 'd'&#160;?
 LelouchVC2: do average is 105.5
 rak1507: making it lower case failed other cases
 rak1507: idk
 LelouchVC2: Some CoC are broken
 Zerp: is there a way to view distance between factories in gitc?
 Uljahn: they are given in inputs i guess
 WINWINWIN: For distance between any 2 factories, google Floyd Warshall algorithm
 EvgenieTivaniuk: I am now trying "Test befiore validate". All testcases are successful, but on  "submit" I fail a hidden case. I guess I'm missing something, but can't guest what. Is there way to check hidden testcases somehow? I can't fix if I don't know where the error is.
 Zerp: i just finished implementing it
 Zerp: but i'm trying to compare my output matrices with the actual distances
 Uljahn: read the discussion page for the puzzle, EvgenieTivaniuk
 EvgenieTivaniuk: @Uljahn Can I access it before I solve it 100%? I didn't find the link.
 Uljahn: EvgenieTivaniuk: which puzzle are you on?
 Zerp: this is supposed to send troops to the nearest non-ally factory, i don't think it's using the optimal paths

 IamthatIam: hello world
 IamthatIam: I am new to this site
 Hjax: hello 
 IamthatIam: @Hjax how are you?
 Hjax: pretty good
 struct: hi
 Hjax: hi struct
 Undaare: Is there a reason, why to not share your code when you are in 1st place of the Clash of Code? I play this game, to learn from others. If the code is not shared, this game is useles for me.
 Hjax: maybe you arent proud of your code
 Hjax: or you have secrets 
 Astrobytes: Some people may still wish to remain competitive
 tanmaycodernovice: @Aisenma hey bro 
 Aisenma: yo&#160;?
 tanmaycodernovice: nvm solved it 
 Aisenma:&#160;:)
 LeBaoHoang8A4: Whut?
 pardouin: 95% of top 1 share their solution
 pardouin: so it's no big deal if a few hide it
 Uljahn: btw what esoteric techniques do you learn in clashes? :smirk:
 pardouin: most of the time it's useless golf but sometimes there are nice regex solutions for example
 Hjax: ever know you are tired and that theres something wrong with your code
 Hjax: and you literally cant figure it out 
 Hjax: thats me right now 
 Hjax: its got to be so obvious, but my brain just cant 
 Astrobytes: Take a break
 Hjax: its 10 am 
 Uljahn: just turn 360 and go away
 Astrobytes: Go have some coffee, take a walk
 Hjax: i wonder if i just dont understand how java handles bitwise operations 
 Astrobytes: It's a bit different to C/C++ iirc
 Hjax: basically i have (a &amp; b = a) when (a &amp; b = b) is expected, but if i do the same math and print the result out on a separate line, i get (a &amp; b = b)
 WINWINWIN: When you print an array in C++, is it given like in python with the square brackets etc.?
 WINWINWIN: like cout &lt;&lt; arr &lt;&lt; endl
 WINWINWIN: ['elem1', 'elem2'] 
 Hjax: dont think you can do that WINWINWIN
 Astrobytes: No, you'll get a memory address
 WINWINWIN: Not trying to print like that, trying to understand the debug prints from Othello
 WINWINWIN: Fixed the minimax and ported over to C++ now it wont store the board properly -_-
 Astrobytes: In what way?
 WINWINWIN: I have a char board[8][8];
 WINWINWIN: cerr &lt;&lt; board[7 - i] &lt;&lt; endl;
 WINWINWIN: ........................
 WINWINWIN: that is a set of 24 dots, dont get why 24?
 Hjax: lmao i found it, i &lt;&lt; i instead of 1 &lt;&lt; i
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: what are you trying to print exactly WINWINWIN
 WINWINWIN: the board...
 Astrobytes: duh
 Astrobytes: The whole board?
 WINWINWIN: I want to see the state and understand it
 Hjax: oh it seems like two people in chat are struggling to print an othello board
 WINWINWIN: Yeah
 Hjax: thats what my bitmath does too 
 WINWINWIN: I'm trying to get the board in inputs but for whatever reason its not working
 WINWINWIN: so error prints give this, can't get why
 struct: why 7 - i?
 Astrobytes: yeah
 WINWINWIN: I used the top left corner as (0, 0)
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/788249b7-fd60-440f-b7bd-cc7d36d67079">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/788249b7-fd60-440f-b7bd-cc7d36d67079</a>
 struct: does arr[0] even print the entire array in that row?
 Astrobytes: woops  I gave you the 1D version
 WINWINWIN: Yes
 WINWINWIN: Any idea why the 24 dots?
 Astrobytes: Why aren't you just doing a double for loop to loop over the array?
 RoboStac: c style arrays are just passed as pointers with no size information, so printing one to debug prints it as a c style string (keep printing until a null terminator)
 WINWINWIN: It is a double loop
 RoboStac: the easiest thing to do is print every cell individually
 wlesavo:     # To debug: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True) :scream:  :scream:
 Astrobytes: yeah they posted in the forum that they updated the python stub
 wlesavo: gj
 jrke: hey anybody on kaggle here
 WINWINWIN: Me
 Astrobytes: thibpat has a discord channel for Halite 4 if you're doing it jrke
 jrke: Oh thanks
 Alshock: just a random question: If a floyd warshall is slower than N² floodfills, somethings really wrong with it, right?
 Scrimmy: hi, is there a way to toggle line comment on multiple lines?
 Uljahn: yes
 Uljahn: ctrl+/
 Uljahn: Alshock: no why?
 Uljahn: floodfill is one-to-many and F-W is many-to-many i guess
 Uljahn: many==all
 Scrimmy: Uljan: ty
 Scarfield: Floyd Warshall is O(n3) Alshock
 Alshock: and N² floodfills should be O(n⁴), no?
 Alshock: I think there was something wrong with my stuff, but I'll go the easy way and simply check it out later this week
 Scarfield: floodfill is n2, if you do it from every cell, it will be n3, which i suppose Floyd Warshall is, havent used it, but it has been mentioned here before
 Alshock: Oh that's because N here is the number of cells, not the width of the grid, right?
 struct: yes
 struct: N = number of cells
 Scarfield: yup, n = width * height
 tanmaycodernovice: @elmarcho please share ur code dude
 imbadpython: hello
 imbadpython: floyd warshall is v^3
 imbadpython: are you guys talking about rgid
 imbadpython: and flood fill why you doing n^2 of them
 imbadpython: floodfill is n^2
 imbadpython: or |V| i guess
 elmarcho: @tanmaycodernovice just a few nasty tricks I saw from someone else
 imbadpython: still share it 
 imbadpython: its common sense to share code in CoC right
 elmarcho: already dine done
 elmarcho: already done
 Alshock: @imbadpython nope
 imbadpython: why
 imbadpython: wait nope for what
 Alshock: Just let people do whatever they want to
 imbadpython: bruh okay
 Alshock: it's a competition system, not a teaching one
 imbadpython: its fine i get number one anyways smh

 Zerp: anyone know how you remove an element from an array knowing it's index in c#?
 QossMean: RemoveAt
 gigicoco: :beers:
 Hjax: Astrobytes you here?
 Zerp: i think that only works on lists
 QossMean: But you can use ToList and ToArray 
 QossMean: To easily convert
 Zerp: ah okay
 Astrobytes: Hjax wassup
 Zerp: shouldn't arr = arr.ToList().RemoveAt(index).ToArray() work?
 QossMean: Yes, it should
 Zerp: it's complaining about the last dot
 Zerp: Operator '.' cannot be applied to operand of type 'void'csharp(CS0023)
 QossMean: Oh yeah
 Zerp: aka the "dot" before ToArray()
 QossMean: RemoveAt doesn't return the list
 QossMean: It just applies the remove to it
 QossMean: So you need to do it in two steps
 pardouin: it's funny when the 2nd submited before you and didn't share his code and you share a code with half his number of chars XD
 Zerp:         factoryArr.ToList().RemoveAt(minFactory);
 QossMean: var l =factoryArr.ToList();
 Zerp:&#160;?
 Uljahn: can you see sharp, Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: if you keep track of how much you can do a bit more
 imbadpython: has anyone done Bulls and Cows 2 here
 imbadpython: and can give me a hint?
 imbadpython: it's so hard
 Hjax: Astrobytes can i pm you about some othello stuff 
 Astrobytes: Go for it Hjax
 imbadpython: @dbdr you here
 dbdr: yes
 imbadpython: can you give me any hint on bulls and cows 2
 imbadpython: the one where you guess the secret number
 dbdr: did you do the puzzle?
 imbadpython: wait oh
 imbadpython: the 4 digit one?
 imbadpython: I haven't but i can solve it
 imbadpython: my current code currently gets 45% it's bruteforce and can solve up to 5 digit
 imbadpython: actually sorry i realise the puzzle is different, ill think about it first. sorry for bothering you
 dbdr: have fun&#160;:)
 imbadpython: is there a smarter way other than bruteforce
 dbdr: the puzzle is a bit out of my head at the moment
 dbdr: what do you call bruteforce in this case?
 imbadpython: emm first generate the (10k?) possible 4 digits
 imbadpython: then eliminate the possible ones for each guess
 imbadpython: impossible
 imbadpython: *
 wlesavo: that is the way, but you need to optimise it quite a bit to solve 10 digits
 wlesavo: i think brute force with python for 10 digits is impossible
 imbadpython: yes
 imbadpython: definitely
 wlesavo: i managed to solve only 7, further just some simple greedy algo
 wlesavo: i.e. take a guess, mutate some digits to get another valid number if there are more bulls than in  previous guess keep it
 hanzhere: :heart_eyes:
 imbadpython: wdym for "i managed to solve only 7"
 somethingjustlikethis: help me
 wlesavo: to brtuforce up to 7 digits
 imbadpython: :O
 struct: Should i use fen notation if i ever port it?
 Astrobytes: Works for me. Use Shredder FEN for 960.
 Astrobytes: Or whatever works for everyone
 Astrobytes: Wait, struct, do you mean as input?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Oh I thought you meant as debug output or something. No I think just square notation will do
 Zerp: holy shit, i just spent an entire looking for a bug that caused a function to now work, just realized i never called it
 Zerp: not work*
 Astrobytes: Or algebraic struct - I donno. Open to discussion I think. Regular square notation would be simplest but some folks might prefer algebraic
 Astrobytes: lol Zerp, did the same just yesterday
 Zerp: i hate myself ._.
 Astrobytes: meh, it happens
 jacek: hmm puzzle of the week
 jacek: i see familiar nick on top 2
 struct: I wonder who it might be 
 jacek: so hot ~
 dobroleks94: Hello everyone!
 jrke: hello
 jacek: ohai
 bohuss: ){
 trictrac: gg jacek on othello&#160;!! 
 Astrobytes: oh wow, I didn't see that!
 Astrobytes: very gg indeed
 jacek: you cant see that hight?
 Astrobytes: Ha. Ha. :P
 Astrobytes: Very impressive. Lucky submit or solid change?
 jacek: we may never know
 trictrac: we have all a new target
 jacek: now lets see trick's response
 jacek: its like unlocking new level
 Astrobytes: :D
 trictrac: nothing ready no danger
 Astrobytes: Give trictrac an hour or 2 at least jacek&#160;;)
 Hjax: there goes my theory that tric always has a better bot waiting 
 codeing: hi.
 codeing: i want to write trim() algorithmic.
 codeing: but i find a little problem.
 code_maniac: What's the problem&#160;?
 codeing: String test = "     toto    "; test.trim(E e)
 codeing: test.trim(" ") return "toto" 
 codeing: we delete space before and after
 dobroleks94: function trim() doesn`t take any argument, does it?
 codeing: yes. but how you write it&#160;?
 dobroleks94: do you want to write your own trim function?
 dobroleks94: try to use RegEx
 dobroleks94: (\\s+)(.*)(\\s) - something like this
 dobroleks94: and return second group
 dobroleks94: i.g (.*)
 dobroleks94: *ie
 dobroleks94: ))
 dobroleks94: this one is suitable:
 dobroleks94: (\s+)([A-Za-z0-9].*[A-Za-z0-9])(\s+)
 AntiSquid: ah regex black magic
 AntiSquid: alright, going to the shop to buy myself something nice, any suggestions?
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: does anyone else have this problem?
 code_maniac: You need to use anchors as well 
 code_maniac: ^(\s+)([A-Za-z0-9].*[A-Za-z0-9])(\s+)$
 jacek: you give the guy how cant trim the solution of regex?
 jacek: now he has 2 problems!
 Voidsway: I would just use replace...
 wlesavo: how many rollouts considered to be ok in oware for raw mcts?
 Astrobytes: Donno. Wouldn't advise it though
 wlesavo: too late, already implemented 
 Astrobytes: Switch to EPT variant and work on eval
 wlesavo: well its not exactly raw, i have e-greedy rollouts
 Astrobytes: oh ok
 Astrobytes: How many are you getting?
 wlesavo: only around 1k for turn 2 
 Astrobytes: You can definitely do better than that. Depth?
 struct: I have beaten the french 
 wlesavo: i stop around round 50 from the current time
 wlesavo: yeah, thats probably it
 wlesavo: and also im not hashing anything
 struct: Whats EPT?
 Astrobytes: early playout termination
 Astrobytes: High depth doesn't work well in Oware wlesavo
 wlesavo: hm, ok, thx
 Astrobytes: "I have beaten the french " struct, clashing again?
 struct: it was just 1 clash&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Hey I'm not judging
 Astrobytes: How's Project X coming along?
 struct: taking a bit of time
 Astrobytes: Still in JS module hell?
 struct: yea
 Snef: anyone know the memory limit&#160;? i thought it was 750 MBHas it changed&#160;?
 struct: Dont think so why?
 Snef: i just tried to allocate 2GB of node and it works
 struct: yeah, but try storing stuff on them
 Astrobytes: ^
 Snef: on all of them&#160;?
 Snef: just tried to change one value on the 65500001 th and it didn't timeout
 tim-kt: hey
 struct: did you try reading it aswell?
 Zerp: this is weird, in gitc i tried implementing a method account for troops being sent to factory, but it seems to make the bot worse :d
 Snef: struct yes
 Zerp: not sure if its a bad idea in general or just bad implementation 
 struct: I can't remember but I asked the same question when I did uttt
 struct: And someone told me to try something that instantly broke the bot
 Zerp: do you play gitc too?
 struct: No, I was talking about node allocation on UTTT
 Zerp: oh mb
 Snef: i did that maybe it's not enough to break my bot struct

 SituatedDust: sure&#160;:)
 SituatedDust: also my apologies for using defib and Defib, i didnt mean for anybody to read this code:grimacing:
 SoLiDwAtEr: Do you guys find yourself actually getting better over time with these puzzles? or not really?

 Irene_iylr: anyone playing checkers here?
 TheSpiffiest: Yep for checkers
 TheSpiffiest: Just started. It finds simple moves and picks ones at random. Ranked about 40ish in wood league
 TheSpiffiest: I just realized I always assume I'm the black ones so that explains a lot.&#160;:)
 Irene_iylr: I assumed m the red one..but I was wrong
 TheSpiffiest: first line of input is your color
 Irene_iylr: yes 
 TheSpiffiest: huh, now that I'm debugging it I get "w" as the color, not r/b like I expected
 Irene_iylr: I started with codingame just about yesterday did some easy ones and today I'm feeling  m dumb
 TheSpiffiest: Ha, same.  I'm on day 3 I think
 Irene_iylr: yes..you can check out the forum its mentioned there ..maybe its a bug or something
 TheSpiffiest: I've got the basic moves, then basic offense, next is detecting when you're vulnerable, and after picking the best move
 TheSpiffiest: the rule that you have to jump if you are able can be used to set traps
 WINWINWIN: I guess that w means you are the one to move first
 twitlydoof: mangekyou sharingan
 TheSpiffiest: yep, and the direction changes. My logic is all built around trying to get to row 7.
 TheSpiffiest: Kinda fails when you start in row 5&#160;:)
 twitlydoof: shortmode is a horrible idea

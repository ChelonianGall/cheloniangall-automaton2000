 BenjaminUrquhart: Lysk ok thanks, so no cheesing lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: made some improvements and it looks like it might be enough to leave wood
 BenjaminUrquhart: finally
 BenjaminUrquhart: still not using spells, just needed to make movement less dumb
 BenjaminUrquhart: yep, bronze time
 aCat: nice, congratz&#160;;]
 Kokoz: gg
 BenjaminUrquhart: added basic wind usage 
 BenjaminUrquhart: although it's getting late so I might stop soon
 BenjaminUrquhart: adding wind is pushing me up so far lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: well I just learned a new dumb strat
 BenjaminUrquhart: and that's abusing wind stacking to yeet monsters into the opponent base
 VizGhar: yes, its dumb&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: well that's a problem for later cause I need sleep and I need to refactor the spell code for that
 BenjaminUrquhart: at least I have something lol
 EvModder: are any c++ libraries (outside of std) available?
 EvModder: I'd really love to use some absl or boost features if possible
 therealbeef: nope
 EvModder: oof, guess i'm switching to java then lol
 EvModder: c++ is too bare-bones (if codingame doesn't give us boost/absl)
 EvModder: next year with c++23 I think we will finally get the new hash containers in the std
 Bernard_Lowe: Does anyone know what distance is defined as "near_base" in the game? 5000 distance from base? 6000?
 _NikJ: If a monster comes within 5000 units of a base at the end of a turn, it will target that base. nearBase: 1: if monster is targeting a base, 0 otherwise.
 _NikJ: I'd say it's 5000 then
 _NikJ: I think fog visibility from base is 6000, maybe you got confused there
 _NikJ: Or I'm confused?
 DaNinja: yep 5000
 Bernard_Lowe: I think you're right. 5000 is the mark because targeting happens at 5000.
 Bernard_Lowe: I have a set of code to loop, and instead of using this, I'd rather set distances from base 5000, 6000, etc.
 Bernard_Lowe: Thanks.
 Enknable: near base is also set if the trajectory would lead to the base..
 Enknable:&#160;?
 Enknable: ah nm
 Bernard_Lowe: I don't think so. I think that's "threat_for"?
 Bernard_Lowe: I think they became same thing within 5000 units.
 Enknable: right. so threat for == 1 means it will eventually
 Bernard_Lowe: Yep.
 _NikJ: means it's currently HEADED your way Enknable
 Bernard_Lowe: I'm adding a loop to check these threats 1000 units outside my base to catch them quicker.
 _NikJ: When nearBase is also set, means it's within 5000
 Enknable: A Promise. To target your base &lt;3
 Kokoz: I dont know what I am doing *.*
 _NikJ: I tried that, Bernard_Lowe, but I got more consistent results using just the nearBase flag instead
 _NikJ: Maybe I didn't manage to find the sweetspot
 Bernard_Lowe: Hrmm. Good to know. I'll test it out as I'm already almost done.
 _NikJ: I have yet to try implement Shield and Control
 _NikJ: So far I'm only using Wind to push off enemies which are dangerously close
 BenjaminUrquhart: I basically do raytracing on every enemy to see if they'll be a problem at some point
 BenjaminUrquhart: and only target those
 Bernard_Lowe: You'll have to walk them out with mind control multiple times if they are near hitting your base.
 MeWhenI: i think the game gives you flags for free to tell you those things and keep you from having to run the calcs yourself
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't believe it accounts for enemies that aren't currently headed for your base but will get within 5000 units and redirect
 _NikJ: I don't let them get that close yet, Bernard_Lowe, I'm playing it more defensively
 MeWhenI: it does, Benjamin
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh ok
 MeWhenI: if an enemy is headed towards your base, threat_for will be 1
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'll still keep it so I can update monsters that are out of vision
 MeWhenI: that makes sense yeah
 LarsVR: how do I know which rank I need to get to pass on to the next league?
 LarsVR: the ai doesnt seem to be in the leaderboards anymore
 MeWhenI: are you in bronze?
 LarsVR: yes
 MeWhenI: next league doesnt open up until tomorrow
 LarsVR: oooowh ok
 LarsVR: good to know, ty!
 MeWhenI: np
 MsonC: Anyone here playing CoC?
 JonByte: maybe
 dbf: can anyone send a link to chat wiki archive?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?limit=50&amp;days=7&amp;enhanced=1&amp;urlversion=2">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?limit=50&amp;days=7&amp;enhanced=1&amp;urlversion=2</a>
 tealfrog: will the rules for getting into silver announced when it opens?
 BenjaminUrquhart: there are no more rules
 BenjaminUrquhart: bronze is the last one with new rules
 jrke: pacman had one extra rule in silver but till now i am unable to figure out what does that rule meant
 jrke: :grinning:dead pacs
 eulerscheZahl: for pacman that wasn't planned initially. only added because players complained
 dbf: thanks, euler
 tealfrog: It's my first challenge, how it was organised in the past?
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, centralized? not sure what you ask for
 tealfrog: I need to plan my time. If my bot is good enough I would switch to other project
 eulerscheZahl: depends on what you want to achieve
 eulerscheZahl: you will certainly drop a lot of ranks if you get inactive now
 tealfrog: I have plenty of ideas how to improve it but I cannot work on it full 9 days
 eulerscheZahl: that applies to most particiaptns
 tealfrog: i guess
 tealfrog: that's why clear rulles would be helpful
 eulerscheZahl: there are clear rules: new league opens every 2 days: silver, gold, legend
 eulerscheZahl: with a boss that's chosen from existing player submissions
 eulerscheZahl: at the end there will be a final rerun to stabilize ranking for min(100, legend) players
 eulerscheZahl: then results are final
 tealfrog: so we have 2 days to advance to the next league?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 eulerscheZahl: new league opens at some time. then you are either in it already or you can promote, just like with wood
 eulerscheZahl: repeat 3 times
 BenjaminUrquhart: a new league opens every 2 days, but you have the entire rest of the contest to get into it
 MeWhenI: does silver open in 20 min?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 eulerscheZahl: by unix timestamp it opens tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: by experience from the past in 2 days
 MeWhenI: ah k
 eulerscheZahl: unlikely that CG does anything on the weekend
 eulerscheZahl: you should be around top50% of bronze to reach silver
 jrke: i think there are better bots than butcher in arena but due less battles none got succes to breach his lead maybe
 tealfrog: ok, so at the point when the next silver league opens the boss for the bronse will be selected and I will see the level of my bot / have chance to improve? 
 tealfrog: ok, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: yes. you can always submit until the timer reaches 0
 eulerscheZahl: 9 days to go
 MeWhenI: where would i look to see the arena scoring formula
 therealbeef: hmm, still three people from same company in top 10, interesting
 EvModder: dang, i get back from work and my bot has fallen to &gt;1000th place
 EvModder: time to start actually using spells lmao
 dbf: time to stop work&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: scores are computed via TrueSkill algorithm
 EvModder: dbf yeah, im considering taking some days off next week to focus on the challenge
 EvModder: last contest (spring2020) was a ton of fun for me, despite dropping rank in the last hour lol
 EvModder: definitely worth dedicating time to
 _NikJ: hm, seems that someone almost overtook butcher, same company, same language, same score :D
 _NikJ: maybe playing against himself?
 Illedan: Too few games now to beat him properly
 therealbeef: same strategy?
 EvModder: i've been playing against butcher in ide with my new (bronze league rules) bot
 EvModder: i feel like he has so much more strategy implemented than i do
 therealbeef: interesting how he managed to do that in less than 1 day
 EvModder: but i have a trick up my sleeve that i know he isn't using (not yet anyway)&#160;;)
 _NikJ: What kind of magic are you using in this one, Illedan?
 Illedan: wind, control and shield
 jacek: happy Caturday
 jrke: i lost one match cause i finished my all mana and even after that i keep casting them leading to WAIT :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: exciting story
 EvModder: i noticed butcher is very efficient with mana, he will run all the way down to 0 to carry out an attack if he thinks he can win
 EvModder: the only times i beat him currently are 1) his scouting is bad and he gets surprised by monster randomness, and 2) he runs out of mana while attacking me and i am able to defend then counter attack
 Jerrasterix: He wrote a sim that quickly, ohhh my gosh.....
 EvModder: idk if i am going to bother with a sim personally... the IDE is kinda slow, but i'm not going for any machine learning approach or anything like that
 Jerrasterix: :innocent:
 Jerrasterix: all I know to do is to write if else statements :laugh:
 EvModder: ultimately that's all you need :grin:
 EvModder: now that i'm abandoning c++ for java, it's time to start using my dirty minecraft modding tricks
 Jerrasterix: :thinking:
 Nerchio: good choice
 EvModder: if they change any of the base configuration setting my new bot will break quite a lot
 Jerrasterix: how is minecraft related to this&#160;??
 EvModder: i meant programming-style wise, minecraft is in java and it's a mess
 EvModder: my code is not obfuscated but ultimately it probably would be any less readable if it was
 Jerrasterix: ic
 Suenodk: Hi! In the spring challenge is the output in the same order when reading the entities (heroes)?
 DaNinja: yes
 jrke: yes
 Suenodk: Thanks!&#160;:)
 MeWhenI: lol the score checking seems a bit whacky, submitted identical code twice in a row and got 26th once, 11th the second time
 _NikJ: that's normal, I went from 80th to 150th :D
 MeWhenI: yeah, just seems like the "you get 45 battles to base your score off of" approach isnt the best, pretty random
 jacek: well, buy more servers *_*
 BenjaminUrquhart: remember that when people submit and gets matches against you, that will also influence your ranking
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622529695">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622529695</a>
 karliso: turn 67: mob has left visible area, then control makes it move back, but it moves through wall right in base attraction radius.
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Can I ask here general questions about programming?
 Jerrasterix: yup 
 jacek: only spam is allowed here :f
 Manchi_o6o7: Basically, I want to write a library in C++ for finite automata and then connect it with some C# and .NET.
 Manchi_o6o7: I am not sure about the "connection" part
 Manchi_o6o7: If someone has done something similiar before
 Jerrasterix: are planning to do it in C++ for perf reasons 
 Jerrasterix: bcoz, if its managed C++ then it is pretty straightforward, native C++ is pretty difficult task
 Manchi_o6o7: yes, and I am more capable of doing such things in C++. C# is more for the interface with WinForms
 Jerrasterix: then try using C++/CLI
 Jerrasterix: there many tutorials to connect C++/CLI to winforms
 Manchi_o6o7: Is C++ CLI much different from native C++
 syahiran: guys im new here
 syahiran: how to play
 _NikJ: slightly different syntax in clr version, nothing spectacular
 Jerrasterix: well, not syntax wise, but instead of compiling it to machine code, it is interpreted in CLR
 _NikJ: I mean, from his point of view, it won't change much, you'll still type the same exact code
 _NikJ: Performance wise? Not quite sure
 Manchi_o6o7: There is no way to combine native C++ code 
 Jerrasterix: there is!! but It is a bit difficult for me atlease
 DaNinja: syahiran <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Jerrasterix: you have make it into an assembly DLL and then link it to the project 
 Jerrasterix: and idk anything about making an asm. DLLs
 syahiran: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: hm, my random bot lacks some incentive to defend the base. at least it collects some mana<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622551623">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622551623</a>
 TobiasA: hmmm what do you mean by random? because that seems better than random
 eulerscheZahl: select random spider target, score outcome after certain depth
 MeWhenI: looks like a decent bot setup, if the one in your base used some wind spells i think ud be in the clear there
 Jerrasterix: minimax&#160;??
 TobiasA: hm which means you have a sim already?
 eulerscheZahl: my sim does not account for spells
 eulerscheZahl: and no minimax, just myself in solo mode without opponent
 Fox787: Better mine which currently if i'm "enemy" always pushes enemies into my base with wind
 Kokoz: I still don't know what I'm doing q.q
 Kokoz: too much inputs to process 
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, wow you mentioned that you are not sure about the game, but have a sim already&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: very basic sim
 Jerrasterix: you are talking to previous No.1 player
 TobiasA: After an entity moves towards a point, its coordinates are truncated (when below halfway across the map) or rounded up (when above halfway across the map), only then are distance-based calculations performed (such as monster damage).
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, I had an idea about sim also, but looks like it is required to simulate opponent including spells because they are importannt and it is not easy..
 TobiasA: is this important or nah
 eulerscheZahl: emphasis on "previous", Jerrasterix
 eulerscheZahl: and i still don't know how to best approach the game. probably a hybrid of sim + heuristics. but where to draw the line and how to puzzle it together?
 dbdr: the top 3 question&#160;;)
 dbf: it is easy: use heuristics when they are better than sim in this case, otherwise use sim
 Jerrasterix: just imagine some top coders are struggling, just look at those who are not that good :cry:
 dbdr: while !top1 { rewrite_everything() }
 TobiasA: if feel you
 TobiasA: *I
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl I respect the C#
 Kokoz: what is "sim"?
 eulerscheZahl: simulation
 Jerrasterix: simulation 
 eulerscheZahl: compute the outcome of your actions and look a few turns into the future
 Kokoz: ohhh.. It becomes even harder, nice
 Kokoz: I think I will satisfy with bronze :D
 TobiasA: lol
 shauli: I have a probelm running the game locally because of Guice injectors, does someone solved why it throws exceptions?
 ashiknur: if I play with randome bot and lose the game, will my rank decrease?I was in top 500 after playing with butcher2013 2 times my rank is 600.
 Kokoz: I have few other ideas I will try but I am still beginner (or low intermediate)
 MeWhenI: no, playing bots in IDE doesnt affect your rank
 Nerchio: threatFor is weird, it gave me a 1 even though the mob literally walks outside the map?
 Nerchio: and never reaches my base untouched
 Gabbek: Nerchio show the replay, please
 MACKEYTH: I've been ignoring threatFor and just simming monsters to see if they pose a threat
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622566891">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622566891</a> turn 200, id 157 on the left
 Fox787: It's a known bug, effectivly it will walk into base range, after that mob has left the play area
 Poligraph: jabka
 Nerchio: Fox787 what do you mean
 Fox787: Basically the mob will be a threat for X base, because it will walk into the minimum distance for the base, if the circle for the base extended beyond the game map
 Fox787: but becasue the game map is limited, it's a false poitive, the mob is killed when it walks off screen
 Nerchio: yeah so its a bug
 Nerchio: sad for people who will never read this lol
 eulerscheZahl: meh, you don't need that input
 Nerchio: I mean if you are not simming its quite good
 eulerscheZahl: except - i remove spiders that leave the map area
 Nerchio: but its a bad input if it doesnt work
 therealbeef: the referee code is quite bad yeah, and some things are not described in the rules, such as the sudden death feature (which admittedly probably doesnt affect play much)
 Nerchio: I only sim spiders with threatFor=1 and my bot timed out because it never reached the base
 MeWhenI: butcher is out of #1 spot
 therealbeef: another bug is that you can cancel a control spell by doing a wind spell on the same target in the next turn
 MACKEYTH: That may be intentional
 InstantWin: mewhenl maybe same bot
 dbdr: therealbeef, what is sudden death?
 Jerrasterix: they both are from the same company
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl so you can't wind monsters from outside the map area? like x &lt; 0
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea what's possible and what isn't
 therealbeef: suden death is that spiders spawned from turn 200 onwards don't get completely random direction but target the bases
 eulerscheZahl: my sim does not account for spells at all yet
 MeWhenI: yeah, maybe sp
 InstantWin: SAMSUNG SDS
 therealbeef: but 20 turns is usually too little to actually reach a base
 Kokoz: Can someone help me?Basically I am searching for monsters that are "threat_for" my base and place them in a list. after that I am moving my heroes to the first monster in the list, but sometimes my heroes stop chasing that monster and head to another.. I can't figure out why.. It should still be the first monster in that list.
 Fox787: if you're determining the monster in ist by the same index you're using for heros you're probably send ing hero 1 to 1, hero 2 to 2 hero 3 to 3 by mistake
 Kokoz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622572516">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622572516</a>
 MACKEYTH: I need to figure out how to create these shielded monster rushes that keep killing me.
 Kokoz: @Fox787 I am not using indexes for heroes yet
 Fox787: it's because they arent sorted by "closest" to your base
 StrideNYC: Depends Kokoz, if you are just adding them by threat. Then when the iteration loop is going through the monsters, it is just adding it in that order. Maybe calculating which monster is closer and then adding to list&#160;:)
 Fox787: you're only going to the first one on the list
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: how fun is it dealing with FOG in the sim?&#160;;)
 Kokoz: I will check that out. Thanks
 eulerscheZahl: what fog? it's a perfect information game. if i don't see a spider, it doesn't exist
 eulerscheZahl: oh wow, i at least survived 220 turns <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/622578250">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/622578250</a>
 eulerscheZahl: red=heuristic, blue=search
 Nerchio: lucky
 TobiasA: my favourite quote of the  - day "if i don't see a spider, it doesn't exist"
 LaurensD: Is it possible to switch sides in the PLAY my Code debug screen?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/1530/">https://xkcd.com/1530/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: yes LaurensD. delete yourself + opponent. then add again in reverse order
 _NikJ: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622583970">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622583970</a>
 _NikJ: Damn, he kicked my A
 eulerscheZahl: [auto] watch your language
 InstantWin: ass
 LaurensD: Thanks @eulerscheZahl
 _NikJ: I tricked antiwonto but saying A
 eulerscheZahl: looks like the bot is offline
 jacek: balls, isnt it
 DjTrilogic: i'm struggling with the formula to know whether a spider can reach my base or not, based on its direction (speed? ) .. anyone can help me&#160;?
 Uljahn: you mean it's not given in the inputs?
 burnpanck: eulerscherZahl wait how do you play two different versions of your bot against yourself?
 jacek: he plays himself :v
 DjTrilogic: i want to know whether a spider is going toward my base or not
 burnpanck: never mind - apparently I never really clicked those player icons in the IDE before...
 Kokoz: So at the end of the turn, monsters with position less then 300,300 deal damage to my base?
 VizGhar: no Kokoz you just described square :P
 Kokoz: so, if the distance is &lt;300??
 Kokoz: &lt;=300 *
 Poligraph: does it really matter?
 Kokoz: for my calculations, yes :c
 StrideNYC: _Nikj... that replay was awesome lol.
 _NikJ: Uljahn, apparently, the threatFor that's given in the input applies to the whole radius of the base and in some cases, spider's trajectory may be going towards the "radius", but ultimately ends up walking off the map and dying
 _NikJ: Now, I haven't confirmed this personally, but I've seen people talk about it
 wlesavo: _NikJ this is a known bug, there is an issue in repository about this not sure if or when it will be fixed
 _NikJ: Hm, not sure if I should calculate on my own or just keep using the threat param then
 Uljahn: just calculate ray-circle intersection by yourself if you don't trust the inputs
 TobiasA: what is the best way to test your sim?
 geppoz: _Nikj yes, look step 58 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622612980">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622612980</a>
 dbdr: TobiasA: submit of course&#160;;)_
 TobiasA: like i mean test if it is accurate not whether the bot works
 TobiasA: just the simulation part
 wlesavo: compare the states from simulation and next turn input
 Illedan: Easy with fog :D
 dbdr: :point_up:
 wlesavo: like euler said 
 _NikJ: Tbh, I too am pretending that fog doesn't even exist. If I can't see the entities, they might as well not even be on the map, f it
 Illedan: I track them forever
 Illedan: Spider  with -20000 x? Got it, clamp it inside my base and scream
 wlesavo: the main problem is to track inside enemy base, but it should be solvable with reasonable assumptions
 Illedan: You get enemy mana and hp as input
 Illedan: Easy to track some things
 wlesavo: even easier to just ignore tracking :smiley:
 Illedan: Depends on your goal
 kovi: but no wild mana tracked - i guess that is for reason
 wlesavo: if my goal is not to track anything... :slight_smile:
 Illedan: Top gold it is then&#160;;)
 dbf: oh, you are discussing so advanced tracking&#160;:)
 Illedan: kovi, you can know wild mana to some extent too
 SashaNukem: Wood league 1. Much susses 
 dbdr: knowing wildmana would be useful even for simple heuristics, e.g. get more aggressive if you are losing
 leoni_das: why on earth when my heroes are placed in the red base they don't stay in it when a bug is approaching to it and instead they go to the blue one.. am taking base_x and base_y as inputs&#160;!!!!!
 dbdr: also would help to display it in the viewer for analysis
 Illedan: Do you use the inputs leoni_das?
 leoni_das: yes 
 Illedan: Print to error and validate&#160;:)
 leoni_das: oh it gives me 0 always :slight_smile:
 jacek: oO
 Nerchio: somebody offering free geometry lessons?
 jacek: just dont sin and youll be alright
 _NikJ: do you mean to say that sin is a sin?
 jacek: cos its the same
 AbuAjamiah: how to submit your code after being tested in the arena
 AbuAjamiah:&#160;?
 jacek: you submit in test in arena
 _NikJ: once it's in arena, it's already submitted
 AbuAjamiah: thanks, but i go back to first challlenge
 AbuAjamiah: how to move to the next one
 _NikJ: I'm not quite sure what you mean, AbuAjamiah
 AbuAjamiah: i finished first level, the starting one. now i want to pass to the next one. How Can i do this&#160;? thanks
 _NikJ: You're talking about the Spring Challenge? Once you defeated the boss in Wood 2 (after submitting your code to arena), you will be promoted to the next league - Wood1. 
 _NikJ: It happens automatically
 AbuAjamiah: ahhh thanks 
 Noyotens: how to control one hero per tim?
 Noyotens: *time
 dbf: Noyotens, just send "WAIT" for others if you don't want to move them
 Noyotens: but all of them stops
 _NikJ: You're printing 3 messages each turn, 1 for each hero
 dbf: what do you want to achive?
 Noyotens: i want to keep one at the base
 Noyotens: attack with otheres
 dbf: store id of first in some variable, send move to base for it each time and attack command for others
 Noyotens: @_NikJ thanks, that's ,make sense
 dbf: (in each turn)
 BenjaminUrquhart: just pulled an all-nighter only to get ~100 more places
 BenjaminUrquhart: man
 msumera: you should be happy you didn't pull an all-nighter to drop 500 places
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok but that was like literally my entire night
 BenjaminUrquhart: and only now did I get something working
 msumera: well, in my case the more "smart" and complex solution i do, the worse the result is :D
 BenjaminUrquhart: same lol
 msumera: i got the best results with strategy: attack the closest monster to the base xd
 _NikJ: Only using wind and only using it to defend I was 80th. Atm I'm using complex "strategies" with all the spells, so as a result I'm 160th
 BenjaminUrquhart: well my problem is I lose like half my matches to wild mana so I need to improve on that 
 BenjaminUrquhart: but later, when I'm actually awake
 BenjaminUrquhart: like here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622658764">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622658764</a>
 _NikJ: I think I do okay on the wildmana, but I can't defend myself when people are very aggressive with spells
 _NikJ: + I haven't started "attacking" at all, yet
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't attack either, clearly
 BenjaminUrquhart: and yeah aggression is one of my weak points
 BenjaminUrquhart: I definitely do better but it's still a problem
 BenjaminUrquhart: usually it's when there's a control + monster shield 
 BenjaminUrquhart: since then I can't use wind
 _NikJ: I can't remember who it was, but I watched a replay of someone kicking my a like this:
 _NikJ: Got close to base, used control on my heroes to move them to center, used control and wind on spiders and then just shielded them
 _NikJ: it was instant win lmao
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah that's a thing
 BenjaminUrquhart: part of me wants to make a troll bot that just abandons base and yeets spiders into the opponent
 _NikJ: Somehow, he managed to group them up before that and just instantly placed 3 spiders into the base
 wlesavo: this is why you need to shield yourself :slight_smile:
 _NikJ: IT'S YOU, YOU DID IT wlesavo
 BenjaminUrquhart: I shield myself, just badly&#160;:)
 _NikJ: I recognixed the avatar
 wlesavo: _NikJ yrah, thats sounded like smth i do :smiley:
 _NikJ: Yeah I'm not shielding myself at all, for some reason I convinced myself that it doesn't work and I never even tried it :D
 _NikJ: Your strat is awesome, it's kicking a
 wlesavo: its quite simple though, i abonedoned that bot and now working on cpp version
 Aramang: do the spiders always move straight (assuming no spells)?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah that went as well as I thought it would <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622665849">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622665849</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: until they get close to a base, yes Aramang
 Aramang: ok well i assumed they could change direction, kiond of makes my bot look a bit silly chasing random sideways one to the edge
 EvModder: if 1 person casts "shield" on an entity the **same turn** the other player casts "wind" what happens?
 EvModder: which spells "wins"
 BenjaminUrquhart: the winds takes effect, then the shield
 msumera: shield takes effect from next turn
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's order of actions near the bottom
 BenjaminUrquhart: (bronze)
 msumera: wow, 300th -&gt; 30th with a simple change
 _NikJ: can you change it in my code too?
 msumera: ofc, if only the rules allow it&#160;;)
 _NikJ: I'm only kidding of course :D However the rules? Eh
 _NikJ: I find it kinda weird that top 2 are the same company, same language, practically the same score (both very high above others)
 _NikJ: Sounds illegal, but oh well
 msumera: i got another set of 'simple changes' which should work, but now i'm too scared to submit them
 wlesavo: even more worrying is that butcher submitted just after 3 hours from contest start
 Samer: what's up with that mean yellow button that asks me to quit this and go get a job??
 dbf: msumera why you are scared, you can allways rollback to previous version
 wlesavo: msumera current rank does not really matter, most people havent even submitted an actual version yet
 wlesavo: so feel free to experiment while submits are working :slight_smile:
 Iugi: which ids do the enemy heroes have?
 Iugi: do they have 4,5,6?
 eulerscheZahl: (0,1,2) or (3,4,5)
 Astrobytes: i.e., P1 or P2
 Iugi: so if i am player to my heroes are 4,5,6?
 Iugi: *two
 Astrobytes: 3,4,5
 Astrobytes: count from 0...
 CortexDeveloper: how to get promotion to next league?im beating boss in wood 2 in arena but nothing happens after battles ends
 eulerscheZahl: are you above the boss on the leaderboard?
 CortexDeveloper: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: is your submit 100% finished?
 Astrobytes: 90% wait for it to finish
 Astrobytes: there
 CortexDeveloper: yep, battles completed 100%
 msumera: ok, let's submit new version, i guess i will go down from 30 to 1000
 jacek: 30 to 1000 is going up :o
 msumera: right!
 Kukiss: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e06982e-a2f8-45f6-901d-a3d2da9ae4a3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0e06982e-a2f8-45f6-901d-a3d2da9ae4a3</a>
 Kukiss: ahh, I forget that too long message is a bad idea here
 CortexDeveloper: got it, thank you
 CortexDeveloper: same for guys above me, the also beat boss
 Aramang: it promotes everyone higher than the boss on a timer
 Edwap: Can anyone tell me where to find rules for this spring challenge? Im using TS so i set up webpack to bundle all of my files but im not sure if i can do that
 therealbeef: who knows, maybe they also used this game in a private Samsung hackathon and butcher had a bot still lying around
 jacek: there's the statement
 Astrobytes: if it obfuscates it's not allowed
 jacek: and also referee code
 Astrobytes: otherwise it's fine to minify
 Astrobytes: as long as it can be read by a human
 Edwap: not reallyy i turned off minimization
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: should be fine then
 Edwap: great i'd rather place last because of bad code than some rule i broke&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 SashaNukem: Is my base always on the top left?
 dbf: no
 SashaNukem: @dbf thank you
 Jerrasterix: well for the test rounds yes
 vvandenb: no
 Jerrasterix: but not for the actual matches
 Astrobytes: you can swap sides while testing in the IDE too...
 Aya_Noaman: wait how
 Astrobytes: The DELETE button under the two player avatars
 Astrobytes: Just put yourself in place of the other, and whoever else in your place
 Aya_Noaman: oh okay thank you
 _NikJ: I improved my bot so much that in 10 runs against my arena code I lost 13 times :D
 TobiasA: pls could someone explain this I don't quite understand
 TobiasA: After an entity moves towards a point, its coordinates are truncated (when below halfway across the map) or rounded up (when above halfway across the map), only then are distance-based calculations performed (such as monster damage).
 ZarthaxX: what is your problem TobiasA?
 PiMastah: Going through the calculations for each turn ay lead to float coordinates, which are converted to ints according to the above rules before further calculations are carried out. The conversion truncates or rounds up depending on which base you are closer to
 ZarthaxX: ^
 TobiasA: so if i'm closer to my base i'll truncate otherwise I round up?
 ZarthaxX: sounds like it, yup
 PiMastah: depends which one your base is
 ZarthaxX: i guess this is a way to make it symmetric
 PiMastah: if closer to (0,0) than (17630,9000) truncate, else round up
 PiMastah: disclaimer I haven't checked the referee code :D
 ZarthaxX: same .P
 TobiasA: that also applies if i'm the red team? 
 TobiasA: or is it reversed as red team?
 PiMastah: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L165">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L165</a>
 PiMastah: this is the code that does the part from the rules
 PiMastah: origin is the midway point of the map
 Tuo: is there a way to know if a monster has all of its health left?
 PiMastah: You only get current health as input each round. Curious though why you would need it?
 Tuo: to only send high health monster to the enemy
 PiMastah: then maybe you can check which monsters have high current health?
 TobiasA: thanks PiMastah
 Abdi-29: when it the best moment to use spell wind
 Tuo: but that depends on the max health. Maybe ill keep track on highest health ever seen and assume that is the maximum
 Vintarel: there is a formula for max health, as it is raised of 1 every 6 monsters&#160;!
 Vintarel: every 8* spiders*
 ycsvenom: why there is no format in python
 Hamp: why would max health matter? a 10/16 spider is the exact same as a 10/10 spider
 Kukiss: I think it is about spending mana on 10/16 when next turn you could find 16/16
 Kukiss: but I don't use spells yet, so for me it is very hypothetical problem :D
 Tuo: yes Kukiss, never settle for inferior monsters! :smile:
 Sh4kE: Hmm I'm ranked first in my league but still don't promote to the next. I waited in the arena untill it reached 100%...
 CortexDeveloper: wait little bit moresystem will promote you in 10-30 min
 Sh4kE: ahh thx&#160;:)
 MindController: Guys what  is the radius of base?
 MindController: (How far monster has to be, to get wild mana?)
 JohnyDaison: about 5050
 struct: from what I understand monster can be inside
 struct: but the hero that hits hit must be outside
 Djellowman: ok im done. 2 hours of code is wiped? why doesnt the IDE save the changed you make??
 Djellowman: changes
 struct: did you press play my code?
 Djellowman: no
 struct: It warns you when you close the window
 struct: it only saves when you press play my code or submit
 Djellowman: sad
 Djellowman: submit being test in arena?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: yes
 struct: but my play my code is enough
 Djellowman: i wrote out the entire structure of my bot.... not doing it again
 Astrobytes: pro-tip: do that offline and copy-paste it over
 Astrobytes: you have plenty time to rewrite only 2 hours worth of work
 struct: it will probably take less time now
 Astrobytes: true
 Djellowman: yeah but i don't want to
 Raphael67: it doesn't work the first try anyway
 Djellowman: thanks for the tips though
 TobiasA: when a control spell is used on a target, in the next turn does it move in the new direction or set it's velocity to the new direction then moves the turn after that
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 struct: I think the spell only affects next turn
 struct: so you use control on a spider
 struct: it moves normally
 struct: on the start of next turn the spider vx and vy is updated
 TobiasA: ok thanks
 RAMAKRISHNAPPA_BERIA: KGF
 HenroLST: hello
 ycsvenom: i just got promoted to Wood 1 League :sweat_smile:
 ycsvenom: and i just started 
 SashaNukem: congrats 
 ycsvenom: thanks
 archfan7411: anyone else have issues with the mana input not reflecting the mana value shown on the game's UI?
 Astrobytes: perhaps you are looking at your opponents mana
 archfan7411: good heavens, it would seem I am
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 jacek: oh my
 archfan7411: I've been debugging this for an eternity lol, thank you so much
 Astrobytes: np, it happens&#160;:)
 mester_x: hi world
 ycsvenom: why the vs battles starts at 10 battles then eventually decreases to 2 or 1? 
 ycsvenom: evaluating process takes so much time
 jacek: first 10 is against all spectrum to determine your starting rank
 ycsvenom: hmmm
 ycsvenom: in which league you are jacek?
 jacek: 1459th bronze. just some simple if bot
 Thheo: when will silver open?
 LBPK: Is it possible to demote&#160;?
 Aramang: no, feel free to submit something broken to hang out at the bottom of the league
 LBPK: Great&#160;! Thanks&#160;:)
 CosmicStudios: I never win clash of code&#160;:(
 ycsvenom: you will it's hard in the beggining
 CosmicStudios: I've been doing it for a while but everybody is too fast
 JaredH: I hard coded my base as [0,0] and my first match my guys went and helped the other team
 Mortis_666: 😂
 Alurian: when does silver league open?
 dbdr: League opening: 1650812400000
 ycsvenom: just got promoted to Bronze League
 Alurian: and what does that number mean?
 Alurian: also congratz!
 Alurian: aah unix. tomorrow at 5 silver opens
 jacek: at GMT
 Alurian: 5 gmt +2
 Alurian: 5 pm btw
 CosmicStudios: SO CLOSE :rage: :rage: :rage:

 jacek: :eye:
 CosmicStudios: 2 seconds
 jacek: thats what she said&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Th1nhNg0: Wow im in top 6 now
 Th1nhNg0: xD
 Nerchio: im top 500
 Hackerkrish: jai KGF
 Waffle3z: paralyzed by indecision trying to figure out the meta instead of actually writing any code
 kovi: meta will change when search appear
 kovi: and than again with nn
 jacek: this game is quite unnable
 Waffle3z: time to figure out how to do a search with any meaningful depth
 SirLoxley: I would actually like to see a 'war' story how to train and squeeze in a NN into those 100k
 Astrobytes: read some postmortems and ask the nn guys about encoding
 Th1nhNg0: what is NN&#160;?
 Astrobytes: neural network
 Th1nhNg0: oh, I nerver use it on codingame
 jacek: oO
 TobiasA: jacek have you used NN on CG before
 Illedan: jacek, depends on what you want to NN. But I think you can go about this with simple statistics :P
 jacek: well if there are parameters to tune in the search...
 WannaBeHum1n: general question
 WannaBeHum1n: if someone bot is not using if statements and conditions in general
 WannaBeHum1n: what kind of code is he using&#160;?
 pHALUS: ifless code
 thepianist59: XD
 thepianist59: i am paralyzed and don't know and don't know what to code, which stratégy
 thepianist59: I'm lost XD ...
 Kukiss: WannaBeHum1n you can for example simulate many games using different moves. Score each simulation and choose the one which appears to be the most optimal.
 WannaBeHum1n: wow
 WannaBeHum1n: does this have a specific term i can google
 thepianist59: yes, but for that you have to write the simulation and this game is not easy XD ... I have to write the part about the spells
 WannaBeHum1n: to maybe learn more
 jacek: generally its about simulation future moves
 Kukiss: At list that's how I understand it. But it is too hard for me on an open map like this.
 thepianist59: There are a lot of algorithms you can google ... genetic algorithms, BFS, DFS ...
 Kukiss: at least* :D
 Aramang: i think that would count as monte-carlo simulation...which is a complicated way of saying try random stuff and see what works
 WannaBeHum1n: thepianist59 thnx
 jacek: for board games you have minimax, mcts. then you have genetic algorithms, beam search, monte carlo
 WannaBeHum1n: jacek ty
 WannaBeHum1n: is the game code public on github&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: so people can do simulations&#160;?
 thepianist59: yes, on java
 thepianist59: in*
 WannaBeHum1n: ahh ok
 thepianist59: but the way of working of the spells seems really complicated and I'm a little lost about them, so  don't really know how to simulate them
 thepianist59: maybe try a simulation without and trying putting them after
 jacek: you dont need to simulate everything at first yeah
 thepianist59: yeah , I always forget that and lost myself in my code
 thepianist59: ^^
 archfan7411: Where in the leaderboard do I see the boss?
 HYPN05: uwu
 Th1nhNg0: I'm gonna try to simulation the game in python
 thepianist59: me too... we can exchange about that if you want, I'm trying first to simulate the moves
 Iugi: how do you read your own mana
 thepianist59: but even if we manage to simulate, we have to find a way to evaluate the situation obtained at the end , but ther a re not a lot
 Iugi: because the mana is declared in a for loop so...
 thepianist59: at the beginning of your code you have a input for your mana
 Iugi: i dont know how to get it out of there ):
 thepianist59: normally the default template code does it for you
 archfan7411: lugi: in the Python template?
 Iugi: java
 archfan7411: ah
 Iugi: i cant set it to public
 archfan7411: well, you could refactor the template
 Iugi: but it also doesnt let me use it
 archfan7411: to make it read the enemy and your mana normally
 thepianist59: for example, in the default python template there is this code&#160;: my_health, my_mana = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
 Th1nhNg0: I hope I will find a way to simulation it. 
 Th1nhNg0: I'm try to use reinforcement learning
 archfan7411: Nice
 archfan7411: I respect anyone who's trying to use machine learning or anything like it here
 archfan7411: above my skill level
 jacek: machine learning aka if else if else if else...
 archfan7411: hehehe
 Th1nhNg0: Has anyone used machine learning yet?
 _NikJ: mana reading is be default done within a for loop for each player. You can replace it with 2 calls to readline, first one is always your own mana
 archfan7411: that's what I did
 _NikJ: Same, I'm ignoring opponent's mana, keeping my own
 archfan7411: agreed, I have no use for opponent mana *yet*
 archfan7411: I'm sure people have come up with bigbrain strategies for that though
 Th1nhNg0: there is a lot of thing I didn't use, but still got to top 6 xD
 Waffle3z: barely modified my wood 1 code, just made it wind spiders away from the base if they're within 2200
 cclaude42: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7dae54fd-cb47-47b6-ac60-b750ba22d645">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7dae54fd-cb47-47b6-ac60-b750ba22d645</a>
 cclaude42:&#160;? I guess my message was too long for the discord lol
 Waffle3z: can shield your opponent's hero and then wind spiders to their base without blowing the hero along with them so they can't catch up
 archfan7411: you could do that yeah
 Th1nhNg0: nice idea Waffle3z 
 cclaude42: TLDR: would like to go next level but can't find any good resources. Anyone has articles / videos on how to build a bot for things like this&#160;?
 Waffle3z: or wind their heroes away while spiders go towards their base, and then switch once they shield themselves
 cclaude42: Struggling to connect the abstract concepts (MCTS, beam, genetic..) with the practical aspect of coding the bot.
 archfan7411: I've found myself focusing moe on mana collection and sheer bug-killing rather than offense
 archfan7411: *more
 Bernard_Lowe: Can any code be executed after your hero action commands? 
 Waffle3z: for a game like this it's hard, something turn-based like chess is easier to simulate and apply tree searches
 archfan7411: Bernard: yeah as far as I know
 Aramang: cclaude42 I find it a lot easier to start by formulating the problem you want to solve with the bot, then find the algorithm that best matches it
 struct: Yes but it will take time out of next turn
 struct: I would probably not do it
 SuspiciousWombat: Is it possible to start a new round in private clashs instead of always opening new ones?
 Bernard_Lowe: k. I can probably dry run my commands to execute at the end instead then.
 struct: What commands do you need to execute at the end?
 Bernard_Lowe: I want to remember how many times I did X action on the current turn.
 cclaude42: @Aramang I see. I do find it difficult to formulate as Waffle says, on an open game like this. I find it hard to know what even is a step in the right direction (past win / lose)
 TobiasA: is it possible to shield your own hero
 _NikJ: yes, TobiasA
 _NikJ: I've seen players use it, but I haven't done it personally
 TobiasA: ok thanks
 TobiasA: is it possible to control your own hero
 archfan7411: where would that ever be useful?
 TobiasA: i dunno
 _NikJ: is it possible to shield YOURSELF? Hero 0 casting a shield onto himself?
 jacek: eeyup
 archfan7411: Yeah you can shield your heroes
 archfan7411: I see nothing in the manual thing which says you *can't* cast control on your own heroes
 _NikJ: would be fun if you had to shield your hero by casting a spell from other heroes :D
 archfan7411: hehe
 Tuo: could be usefull if someone is wind spamming your hero away from defending base
 Waffle3z: went from like 1700 to 1200 by adding a wind spell to the wood 1 code
 Waffle3z: don't need 3 heroes defending anymore, time to send one over to annoy the opponent
 MACKEYTH: When you control a monster, does it stay on the new course after the control is over?
 archfan7411: Yes, as long as it isn't within 5000(?) units of your base
 msumera: yes, unless it's in the base
 Wontonimo: wow, I got pushed down to 1080th from 200th.  There is quite the power escalation over the last 2 days
 _NikJ: damn, and I thought my drop from 80th to 200th was a big deal
 ZarthaxX: leaderboard always fluctuates a lot :P
 Illedan: Can't have a solid leaderboard on 50 games
 Illedan: and 3.8k players
 _NikJ: ++++++++++
 struct: they reduced it to 50 games?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: It's good
 Wontonimo: some more leagues will clean that up
 Illedan: I just wish I could get 50 games vs the top  :P
 dbf: silver is for tomorrow?
 Illedan: Instead of 30 wins before anything fun in a submit
 ZarthaxX: you are almost there illo
 ZarthaxX: good stuff
 Illedan: Just a bunch of IFs to counter all the cheeses
 Wontonimo: glad to hear that works.  i was thinking of doing that.
 ZarthaxX: i thought you were going to say ga
 ZarthaxX: it's walways GA for u
 ZarthaxX: :P
 dbf: ga + ifs &gt; ga
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo spaghetti time?
 ZarthaxX: dbf hehe tru
 Illedan: Oh, yeah I have a GA too. Just not finished yet. Currently outfarming my main in the first 50 frames
 Illedan: Just taking a break with more IF magic
 struct: rank 1 or 2 are the same person?
 ZarthaxX: ah good
 ZarthaxX: thought the same struct
 Wontonimo: my code is spaghetti with 3 noodles.  it's really simple
 ZarthaxX: do they do the same things on a game?
 struct: no
 struct: but same elo, same language, same company, same country
 Nerchio: great minds think alike
 Wontonimo: oh, i forgot about my smirf account for trying things.  :thinking:
 Illedan: Might be a person with schizofrenia
 jacek: struct thats racist :v
 _NikJ: suspiciously close elo :d
 struct: jacek is gonna cancel me&#160;:(
 therealbeef: 4 samsungs in top 20, must be coincidence
 struct: I'm not making any accusations to be clear
 struct: Was just wondering
 ZarthaxX: struct rank 19 is also the same
 struct: I didnt even noticed there were more people from the same company on top 20
 ZarthaxX: weird haha
 therealbeef: a simple explanation is that they used this game also for a samsung internal competition
 therealbeef: *is = would be
 ZarthaxX: true
 therealbeef: we know it was used in amadeus internal hackathon, so why not more often
 struct: it was used on 2
 struct: EA and amadeus
 Illedan: -.-
 ZarthaxX: oh&#160;:(
 TobiasA: damn I didn't know companies had internal competitions
 Wontonimo: oh course they changed the rules and had different objectives :rolling_eyes: , they wouldn't just be lazy and use exactly the same each time
 therealbeef: it's part of the business model of CG
 ZarthaxX: Wontonimo :D
 Astrobytes: *was
 therealbeef: for EA apparently they used the exact same rules
 jacek: they should have added swap rule at least
 Astrobytes: they switched to escapes instead of internal hackathons
 eulerscheZahl: hey, at least the changed the logo at the top center
 Illedan: I think another logo is below that one :eyes:
 therealbeef: i wondered if the old logo is underneath&#160;:-D

 struct: Why did you lose?
 Illedan: Me?
 struct: yeah
 struct: the end game screen doesnt tell me why
 eulerscheZahl: less lives
 struct: ah ok
 Illedan: Because I didn't see any danger monster nearby and chased all monsters to the other side :P
 eulerscheZahl: or: because he's 2ndthat's what the endscreen tells you why :P
 Illedan: xD
 jacek: no Illedan, you should say "because I let him win"

 ZarthaxX: lol really good one
 Ajaiy: I have heard that joke in numberphile
 Wontonimo: there are 2 types of people in the world:1 - Those who can work with incomplete information2 -
 Ajaiy: lol
 JackMc: There's 2 types of people in the world, those who can extrapolate from an incomplete data set
 Waffle3z: there are 0 types of people in this world:
 Waffle3z: I had so much mana when I wasn't doing spells and now that I'm actually doing spells I never have any mana
 Pieman: I had so mutch money but when I bought a house I never have any money
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why did the blonde crash her car?  she had to count to six
 Wontonimo: i don't get it
 Waffle3z: what
 Ajaiy: Why did the AI basketball stop when it came near the edge of the court? Because it realized that it would run out of bounds/bounce anyway

 Astrobytes: yes, I would advise rewriting it though
 Waffle3z: if a monster is controlled and sent outside the radius of a targeted base, will it stop targeting the base?
 struct: I think so
 aCat: yes
 LaurensD: Yeah bots is not a problem, that would be great actually, but can I still use c# or wouldn't that be compatible; can't really find instructions to run it
 Wontonimo: the attacking in this is fantastic <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622959446">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622959446</a>
 aCat: gest random dir
 struct: Why random dir though?
 struct: isnt the controlled minion supposed to go in that direction?
 Wontonimo: hey LaurensD, there is this community tool called brutaltester  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 Wontonimo: you can pit 2 bots against eachother using the command line.  there is no UI, just game results
 wlesavo: it keeps direction after control
 struct: aCat I think after you controll a spider it will go in that direction forever
 struct: unless someone controls it again
 struct: or if its in base range
 Wontonimo: it can be used to pit 2 different langs or 2 same langs against eachother LaurensD
 Wontonimo: that's correct struct
 LaurensD: Thanks, will take a look at that&#160;:)
 Rddevelop: php or cobol
 struct: c++
 Rddevelop: funny, i also found c++ in some webs about worst programming languages
 Rddevelop: i use php and it tops all lists xd
 Wontonimo: there was a joke about php programmers and brains, but someone complained so I took it down&#160;;(
 Rddevelop: i think i justt saw that one, it was so funny

 ProS: Guys, maybe you know. How can I find out if point is inside circle's sector? Writing about spring challenge. I want to divide base for 3 sectors and give each sector a knight, but I can't understand how to determine if bug inside specific sector
 dbf: ProS, have a look at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13652518/efficiently-find-points-inside-a-circle-sector">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13652518/efficiently-find-points-inside-a-circle-sector</a>
 DaNinja: distance(bug, base) &lt; radius
 Waffle3z: specifying that it is a sector is unnecessary, they can't be in a different part of the circle
 MichExpatMatt: This is pretty straightforward too - but just remember to mind your degrees vs radians, and as far as sin and cos and angle goes, clockwise is considered the negative direction<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHaFwnqH5CU&amp;t=58s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHaFwnqH5CU&amp;t=58s</a>
 MichExpatMatt: Personally I'm trying to figure out the sweet spot for using control to send a spider to the other base, vs not just handing them easy kills for wild mana farming
 Pieman: printf("MOVE 400 400\n"); lifehack
 Pieman: in c
 KCrown: Now that I am better than the boss how long before I am promoted to bronze?
 HoangH7: ASAP
 Wontonimo: once all your battles are complete
 KCrown: OK ... thanks ... just want to see the new rules inbronze 
 Pieman: can you get higher then bronze right now&#160;?
 MichExpatMatt: not yet
 struct: no
 Pieman: when will It be unlocked
 struct: I think monday?
 Pieman: aye ty
 Astrobytes: struct sunday
 struct: They are going to open it on a day off?
 Astrobytes: or it was at least, 3pm GMT
 Wontonimo: there are 2 new spells, shields and control.  Nothing else.  All your old code will work as-is KCrown
 struct: They removed the date
 HoangH7: Too lazy to join this time&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: we'll see I guess
 KCrown: thanks wontonimo 
 Wontonimo: :grin: 
 Wontonimo: submit the starter AI HoangH7
 ycsvenom: is it right to make WIND in direction of center of screen?
 Wontonimo: and then change it so that the bugs are sorted by distance to your base, then you'll be in either top wood 1 or bronze
 Wontonimo: yeah, that works ycsvenom , but it's kinda an angle
 Wontonimo: why not 45 degrees away from current hero&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: why not towards the enemy base?
 Wontonimo: even better
 MichExpatMatt: I like to either point WIND at the center or at the opp's base. If using wind on an opp hero though, I want them away from my base as well as away from their base
 ycsvenom: do i have enemy's base location?
 eulerscheZahl: you can compute it
 Wontonimo: it's the opposite corner, so just calculate it
 MichExpatMatt: you can figure out from being the other base that's not yours
 eulerscheZahl: one is at (0,0), the other at (17630,9000)
 Wontonimo: enemyBase = maxX-myX , maxY-myY
 ycsvenom: but does the game ensure that the base is either here or there?
 ycsvenom: i mean top left and bottom right?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: nah, just randomly flips between them for s**ts and giggles
 Astrobytes: :P
 struct: Should have took some ideas from trolls vs castles
 MichExpatMatt: you can figure out which side is yours vs theirs easily with an if/else though
 Astrobytes: struct :D
 Badoobicus: i want to do some debugging, i think i screwed something up with my vector math. how do I print something to the console without the game getting mad at me for invalid output?
 ycsvenom: i know but i am just worried that it will change in the next leagues or something MichExpatMatt
 Astrobytes: Badoobicus: print to stderr
 struct: I heard it will change on last day
 ycsvenom: which language are you using Badoobicus
 ycsvenom: that's what i am talking about struct
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 struct: I'm joking sorry
 struct: The rules are final
 ycsvenom: nooooooooooooooooo :joy:
 MichExpatMatt: I don't expect the base coords to change - becvause I don't expect they will draw a new background, ergo I think the 2 bases will always be upper left and lower right
 ashiknur: when the silver league will open?
 struct: background.setScale(rand(2.0))
 struct: done
 Beresta: do the heroes attack if they use WIND this turn?
 ycsvenom: they will do one thing each turn i think
 Wontonimo: they attack anything they are near enough at the end of the turn
 Wontonimo: attacking is automatic and always
 Mergesort_Botnet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/23609655635bd14475be5e72755243a593b1326">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/23609655635bd14475be5e72755243a593b1326</a>
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Mergesort_Botnet dont paste those links here.  Use the channel #clash
 Wontonimo: under "Action order for one turn" , step 5 Heroes attack monsters in range and produce mana for each hit.
 TobiasA: when an entity is being controlled, by how much does it move in the given direction
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 MichExpatMatt: I think it's one turns worth? so 400 for monsters, 800 for heroes
 MichExpatMatt: it's in there somewhere I just don't remember for certain
 Wontonimo: RTFM - it's all listed in the docs on the left
 JulienKerlero: Hello there
 JulienKerlero: I have a question for the CG experts
 Astrobytes: just ask&#160;:)
 JulienKerlero: Is functionnal programming a good way to go for the srping challenge&#160;?
 JulienKerlero: Cuz I feel like it might be
 Astrobytes: if you are comfortable in functional programming then sure, why not?
 Ajaiy: It depends on your algorithm
 JulienKerlero: I sketeched a few lines in Python
 Ajaiy: If it uses a lot of math, then functional programming might be good, and so on
 ProS: Can I check locally to be on the other side of the base?
 JulienKerlero: And I'm using a lot of filters and pure functions
 Astrobytes: ProS: you mean swap position?
 ProS: yes
 Astrobytes: Use delete under your avatar/opp avatar and swap
 Astrobytes: *swap sides
 Astrobytes: bottom of the screen, center of IDE
 struct: I had no idea that the bosses were public lol
 Astrobytes: what?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/config/level1/Boss.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/config/level1/Boss.java</a>
 ProS: Thank you man!
 ProS: It worked, God bless you)
 Kyraleese: hey guys, how do you follow someone from their user profile page ...?  I see no follow button or anything like that
 struct: you can check all of them on config folder
 Astrobytes: lol, quality
 Astrobytes: I didn't bother looking this time around
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the bosses when i was looking for a certain function. github shows you references and definitions when you click on it. Boss.java was one of the definitions
 eulerscheZahl: symmetricTruncate
 aCat: yeah, Vector class is copied in Boss etc&#160;;]
 dbdr: which means github is not semantic enough
 Astrobytes: "stupidityCountdown"
 Astrobytes: ah, I only looked at the source offline
 jrke: damn they have given default AI code in referee lol
 struct: I think I found a "bug", have to test it further I guess
 eulerscheZahl: bug in your bot or referee?
 struct: ref
 Ajaiy: #5 in Wood 1, hope it passes
 eulerscheZahl: was never meant to be used for community, so less testing? :imp:
 Ajaiy: Les gooooo
 eulerscheZahl: stupid cat uses the litter box. she was outside 5min ago&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: always makes a mess next to it as she loves to scrape
 Astrobytes: my cat Princess does the same
 Astrobytes: (the one not in the pic)
 Astrobytes: (named by my sister I may add)
 struct: actually no bug
 MichExpatMatt: LOL this battle I'm watching, my opp names his guys Bob, Mark, and Steve
 struct: Im surprised
 eulerscheZahl: your younger cat
 Astrobytes: older
 eulerscheZahl: the discord profile pic
 Astrobytes: no, both my pics are the same cat, Gizmo
 Ajaiy: Hmm not bad
 Ajaiy: my bot works in bronze too
 Ajaiy: not that much though
 SirLoxley: yeah, the wood#2 boss is kind of weak
 SirLoxley: sorry wood#1
 Astrobytes: Princess is black, with 2 white patches, and she had her turn being an avatar many years ago
 eulerscheZahl: Gizmo - you know what comes next?
 Astrobytes: don't I know it
 eulerscheZahl: like the wechall admin
 eulerscheZahl: except it's "Gizmore"
 Astrobytes: haha indeed
 eulerscheZahl: we had that convo a few times
 Astrobytes: we did
 Astrobytes: we're old, it's allowed
 cegprakash: how to round the floating values in this game? ceil/floor/round&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ...
 struct: worse than that
 dbdr: shall we tell ceg?
 struct: After an entity moves towards a point, its coordinates are truncated (when below halfway across the map) or rounded up (when above halfway across the map), only then are distance-based calculations performed (such as monster damage).
 Astrobytes: too late
 eulerscheZahl: Referee.java holds the answers for you
 eulerscheZahl: you're welcome
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl didn't ask u if the answer is in referee. It's confusing that's why asking here in the first place
 Astrobytes: it's in the statement AND the ref, surely that counts for something
 Hamp: I'm getting an error that I have reached the limit of plays for a period of time. What is that period of time? I have waited an hour now
 cegprakash: below halfway, above half way.. do I cut the map in half in y axis struct?
 eulerscheZahl: there are multiple limits in place
 eulerscheZahl: for 15min, 1h, 6h and such. i don't know the exact limits
 Astrobytes: Hamp, very strict limits nowadays, take a rest for a bit and come back/work outside of the IDE - it's annoying AF I know
 struct: thats a good question cegprakash
 struct: I have no clue
 eulerscheZahl: create a new account to get more plays
 eulerscheZahl: or clone the git repo and run it offline
 Astrobytes: or that, just don't submit it
 eulerscheZahl: that can lead to disqualification
 Hamp: thanks, I will just wait&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: it's nice not having to use the alt to chat
 Astrobytes: since we de-modded I mean
 UndercoverToad: what do you mean?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I had a feeling that was coming
 eulerscheZahl: surprisingly many didn't see the link between these accounts
 Hamp: hm
 Astrobytes: not surprising tbh
 Hamp: is something happening with codingame? Havent been active lately but yesterday I heard it might be the last competition and now that the limits are a lot stricter
 ashiknur: Is anyone using AI algorithms?
 Kyraleese: Hamp, heard from where, exactly?
 Hamp: I don't remember, someone said it in chat. I took it as frustrated chatting rather than something confirmed, but just wondering where it comes from if that is the feeling in the community(which it might not even be, just some chatter like I said).
 Astrobytes: Hamp: well, they were acquired by another company, the focus is kinda elsewhere (the business side obviously)
 Astrobytes: Kinda inevitable as they got bigger tbh
 Astrobytes: The other company was CoderPad, an American firm
 eulerscheZahl: CodePad was the pacman and CG the pellet in the merger
 Astrobytes: Hence 'acquired'&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: oh right, 5th word
 Hamp: Astrobytes: Good to know, thanks&#160;:) Shame to see it happen but makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair: the stricter time limits are there for a while
 Astrobytes: AFAIK the community stuff will still remain, unsure about competitions as they are now etc but we'll just wait and see what happens
 eulerscheZahl: more than a year
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think the past 2 contests?
 Astrobytes: coding ones I mean, before this one
 eulerscheZahl: let's check CG Bench commits to find out
 Psyho: I thought CG had 50ms already when first competed (which was few years ago)
 Psyho: or are you talking about different time limits?
 Astrobytes: nah not the bot time limits, IDE plays
 eulerscheZahl: how often you can play your code
 eulerscheZahl: until you have to wait a while until the play button is enabled again
 Psyho: ah, fine, I don't remember those - all I remember is considering writing a tool for automated testing 
 Psyho: are those limits published somewhere?
 Hamp: The last competition I took part in before this one was the MOBA one with the lane and minion farming, no idea when that was but it was definitely a long time ago so the limits are "recent" for me :D
 eulerscheZahl: some were running batches with automated tools - there is a public one. now it's less plays for everyone.limits are not public
 VizGhar: I should create my own CG... with blackjack and hookers
 Astrobytes: Interestingly it seems to have made little to no difference
 eulerscheZahl: halite is open source. the full system, not just the game itself
 eulerscheZahl: all you need is a server
 Astrobytes: Hamp, that was a while ago
 VizGhar: halite?
 Waffle3z: some logic to send one hero over to bother the opponent was enough for top 400
 eulerscheZahl: halite was another bot contest. happened 3 times. now we have Lux AI as its successor
 Astrobytes: Are kaggle still running a halite?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even know
 Astrobytes: yeah, I'm somewhat out of the loop too
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2021/leaderboard">https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2021/leaderboard</a>submits are 5 months old
 eulerscheZahl: and the toad won
 ycsvenom: i was multiplying threat_level by threat_for%2when the opponent suddenly throw a spider at my base and my heroes are just standing there :cry:
 Waffle3z: wind stacks so that means it should be possible to send a spider from 6600 away directly into the opponent's base
 Astrobytes: correct
 kovi: luxai - kaggle playerbase seems totally different from cg/tc/atcoder/etc
 Astrobytes: agreed kovi
 eulerscheZahl: atcoder is another one of those sites i've never really tried
 eulerscheZahl: last optim looked interesting, but only 4h duration
 Psyho: they have a contest tomorrow
 kovi: me neither but atcoders play cg and tc
 eulerscheZahl: tomorrow is codejam day
 Waffle3z: what are the goals of the new owners? do they plan on pushing all of us to alternate platforms?
 dbf: kovi your defence-based bot looks very impressive in terms of wild mana, do you use sim already?
 Psyho: optimization, 8am-12pm CET
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, great timing codejam
 eulerscheZahl: at that time i have a soccer match
 Astrobytes: and I don't plan being awake before 10am
 eulerscheZahl: sports =&gt; recover =&gt; codejam and the day is pretty much over
 kovi: thx dbf...no sim yet
 dbf: eulerscheZahl if you are not a goal-keeper you can code a bit during the match
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: how to make your teammates hate you 101
 Astrobytes: how to get a head injury very quickly
 DjTrilogic: how can i compile the refree and run it in command line&#160;?
 DjTrilogic: javac&#160;?
 kovi: thx psyho. cg and hashcode finals is enough for me these weeks
 Psyho: oh yeah, hashcode finals
 Astrobytes: good luck with hashcode finals you guys
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's next week already. good luck
 Psyho: the contest where they put fit crappy problem that should be good for 7-day contest into 4 hour timespan
 Astrobytes: indeed :D
 eulerscheZahl: that's pretty accurate
 dbf: codejam timing is not perfect - first was in the middle of the night&#160;:(
 Psyho: somehow I liked reply contest better (but I'm biased on the results)
 Astrobytes: I have yet to try it but euler and Ille say the same thing :D
 eulerscheZahl: and no leaderboard to see your post-contest scores
 Astrobytes: dbf: right?!
 Psyho: similar to hashcode, same rules &amp; style, but the problem was managable
 eulerscheZahl: "thanks for the feedback, we will consider"
 dbf: Astrobytes, round 1A
 eulerscheZahl: hashcode =&gt; mostly heuristicsreply =&gt; allows for some search usually
 Astrobytes: dbf: yeah it was like 1 or 2 am for me!
 eulerscheZahl: 3am - 5:30am for me
 dbf: round 1B will be tomorrow in normal time, but I'll be in active cooking stage that time&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: looking at the tasks i probably would have passed in 1A. but tomorrow is another chance
 Astrobytes: it's not great timing for me either but I guess I will have to try
 Psyho: you mean greedy right? since local search is heuristics as well
 eulerscheZahl: yes, greedy
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, oh if you are not sure about passing I'll not be sad that I'm missing it&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: always the same. at least to qualify for finals a greedy is enough if you find the criterion by what to sort
 dbf: based on qualification round I need x4 time&#160;:)
 Psyho: to some extent it's true with, but there were plenty of times where you could squeeze iterative approach
 Psyho: still the main problem is the 10+ page long problem statement
 Psyho: and ton of complexity randomly put into different test cases
 eulerscheZahl: yes, almost like completely different problems
 Astrobytes: that's a bit silly isn't it?
 eulerscheZahl: on the other hand topcoder marathons got more interesting recently IMO. asking for a clever idea and not just a highly optimized SA
 FinnKrause: 
 Psyho: this is fine design but... it's just adds to the complexity
 Astrobytes: I wish I had bothered with the last one in restrospect euler
 Psyho: TC improved their problems by a lot throughout the last few years
 kovi: but its a team competition
 Psyho: too bad the platform is beyond crap
 cegprakash: lol hashcode was comedy this year :D no time lol
 Astrobytes: lol not wrong Psyho
 eulerscheZahl: MM135 finished about a month ago, still waiting for TCO leaderboard update&#160;:(
 msumera: spent whole day on this, enough for today, i'm more than satisfied with 17th&#160;:)
 Psyho: btw, regarding quality of the hashcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/FakePsyho/status/1496973852093685760">https://twitter.com/FakePsyho/status/1496973852093685760</a>
 cegprakash: and the fun thing about google hashcode was the team who won was a russian team with name "Make love not war"
 eulerscheZahl: saw that tweet, Illedan linked it
 Psyho: tl;dr&#160;: there was a single test case that could solve optimall/near-optimally and it would completely dominate the rest of scoring
 Psyho: we were few minutes late&#160;:/
 kovi: yeah, saw that psyhoand this year, the scoring system shows the individual test scores for others
 ycsvenom: is there a way to order a specific hero to go to location not arbitrary oneor the game is ordering heroes in respect to inputs order?
 kovi: no more guesswork
 Psyho: I don't like that aspect tbh
 eulerscheZahl: i really like the idea of relative scoring as on TC. but maybe not a good fit for huge contests like hashcode, i see confused players already
 criag: each hero has its own id
 Psyho: we're probably going to hide all of our scores becaus of that
 Astrobytes: ycsvenom: just choose your hero by id
 ycsvenom: there is no id in move command
 kovi: hiding: interesting, but makes sense for a rare special
 eulerscheZahl: order of outputs ycsvenom
 ycsvenom: thanks
 Psyho: if you're leading, you're giving away a lot of information
 Astrobytes: I was assuming you stored your heroes
 ycsvenom: absolutely i stored them
 kovi: yeah, but if another team reveals...
 Psyho: but every 15 mins matter in such contests
 Psyho: the sooner you have info about which tests are important, the better
 Astrobytes: I output their moves like heroes[i]-&gt;best_move-&gt;print()
 Astrobytes: so I keep track of their id and know which one is which
 Psyho: with reply we performed well mostly, because we guessed correctly which tests are going to matter and we managed to have dedicated ppl for special cases
 Psyho: (otherwise we don't really cooperate in any way)
 ycsvenom: i processed with respect to monster not to heroAstrobytes
 eulerscheZahl: and you have a strong team of topcoder legends
 ycsvenom: i wanna be on your team eulerscheZahl :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: we tried to work on the same code for hashcode once. was a nightmare, never again
 Psyho: that helps, but everyone is in a different timezone
 Psyho: having shared codebase would help a lot, but then we would have to train on that
 Psyho: too much preparation&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: just make sure you know which one is which before you're printing ycsvenom either by ID or position in storage container and you'll be fine
 eulerscheZahl: i spent more time on refactoring as i disagreed on how to store the input than actually solving the problem
 ycsvenom: thanks Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: was that when you did the live coding IDE-sharing thing euler?
 Psyho: if you train together for long enough, you develop similar practices
 eulerscheZahl: VS Code live-share
 ycsvenom: i learned Clean coding before coding eulerscheZahl :smiley:
 Astrobytes: yeah that
 eulerscheZahl: also had a bug: i just scrolled down. it seemingly scrolled up again so i kept scrolling
 Isaax: hello
 eulerscheZahl: until illedan said "why do i have the same block of code 15 times?"
 Astrobytes: yes I remember that
 eulerscheZahl: then VS Code crashed
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Psyho: oh, one thing that also helps is one person dedicated to test analysis
 Psyho: finding special structure in tests etc
 Illedan: When did I say that?
 kovi: as the slowest coder, im the analysis and idea guy
 eulerscheZahl: 2 years ago or so
 Astrobytes: ages ago
 Illedan: Oh
 eulerscheZahl: fun times
 Illedan: I have the same block of code 5 times now
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: Checking the Max Id of monster on map
 eulerscheZahl: but that's bad software design
 Psyho: "idea guy" sounds like the most hated person on the team :D
 struct: This symmetricTruncate must be the most annoying thing ive faced
 Isaax: hello someone can tell me <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/skylines">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/skylines</a> what is the validator 5?

 eulerscheZahl: oh, i shared the validator already
 Astrobytes: so I see :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: good night
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: see you tomorrow, sleep well
 dbf: good night!
 Illedan: gn
 kovi: psyho, i rejected for a long time based on being slow...than accepted invitation few years ago
 Astrobytes: I would reckon that a kovi on the team would be beneficial regardless
 einaj: wow, I optimized a few parameters and suddenly jumped up 100 ranks. Sometimes just a small change in stuff like the heros "resting" positions can really mean a lot
 Psyho: I feel that everyone believes that they are slow
 Psyho: usually everyone is slow when coding something non-trivial
 Astrobytes: Unsurprising given the level of the competition
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes o/
 KiwiTae: the polar bear is nowhere to be seen&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: KiwiTae :hugging: ah he was here earlier
 KiwiTae: reallyyyyy
 ZarthaxX: KIWOOO
 ZarthaxX: im here :P
 Astrobytes: see!
 ZarthaxX: got summoned
 ZarthaxX: just lurking
 dbf: tried to add attacker and now loose to my previous version in ~100 moves&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: dbf: come on, if it worked first time it just wouldn't be the same
 tantheman: WAZZA
 KiwiTae: so far I got a bot crashing when he sees a spider :grin:
 darkhorse64: pure arachnaphobia
 ycsvenom: maybe he's just afraid

 tantheman: yep
 AngXinhGai: hello

 tantheman: ghana provides bananas
 Astrobytes: I think someone needs to go to youtube or something
 RobinV: rens
 cegprakash: threat_for is not at all useful lol..
 cegprakash: threat is off for a long time
 struct: why not?
 struct: its not
 cegprakash: do we get threat on as soon as monsters spawn?
 cegprakash: and comes into fog?
 struct: if you can see him yes
 l10r: does turn time includes the time I get the imput?
 Astrobytes: it begins after you read the first input
 Astrobytes: so start your timer then
 l10r: ok thanks
 struct: I dont even know if this behaviour is intended
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623090424">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623090424</a>

 struct: my control spell was supposed to be full up
 LaurensD: Looks like a ultimate troll to me
 jacek: isnt out of game evaluated as last?
 Astrobytes: interesting
 struct: yes jacek
 struct: but is more about how it snaps to the game zone

 cegprakash: omg hero order is random in input
 cegprakash: I've to sort by ID before storing
 cegprakash: this is so bad
 criag: ooof
 TobiasA: it seems this game has a lot of bug:wink:
 struct: it is?
 TobiasA: you see what i did there
 ZarthaxX: bug = spiders
 ZarthaxX: :P
 ZarthaxX: struct is confuised
 Kukiss: struct, was this wind with vector 'up'?. The animation looks like it is going a bit to the left.
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623094880">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623094880</a>
 struct: this one is correct
 cegprakash: I always command hero1 to pos1 and and hero2 to pos2 but somehow they swap their position in some random turns
 cegprakash: coz heroes are swapped in input
 struct: The wind one works fine
 struct: Its described to be like this
 struct: I was just confused about control
 Kukiss: thanks for 2nd replay.
 tantheman: ayo sub to my twitch
 TheCockmaster: no
 Astrobytes: tantheman &lt;--- struct
 struct: change your names
 Astrobytes: c**kmaster yeah but the other is just spamming
 Kyraleese: ugh, my motivation keeps dropping for this
 cegprakash: okay it's not the heroID issue.. the distance issue.. 
 cegprakash: my bad
 cegprakash: bad coding I think
 Astrobytes: Ballmer peak achieved, time to do something interesting
 Astrobytes: see ya later
 Waffle3z: I submitted a while ago and my rank keeps climbing, looks like everyone else is getting worse over time
 Waffle3z: at this rate I'll be 1st in a couple days
 WannaBeHum1n: need this kinda confidence in my life
 Kukiss: you countered the future meta? :D
 Waffle3z: currently in 322, not using shields at all yet
 Waffle3z: once I do then I'm out of ideas and can resume imagining how to get useful depth from a simulation
 SabertheLost: When is silver released?
 msumera: tomorrow\
 jacek: by heating silver oxide
 SabertheLost: ok, nice. increased from 600 to 155 by only using wind spells
 Ketroc: just defending and WINDing will win a lot through wild mana victories
 SabertheLost: yeah, but you need to get the wild mana for the scoring. 
 andrefpoliveira: defending and winding and I'm 264&#160;:)
 struct: Nice
 struct: I didnt believe it at first when someone said that they sim 8000 turns to see if a mob is a threat or not
 Scarfield: o0

 Wontonimo: that's just silly
 Scarfield: then this for (int idx = 0; idx &lt; basePositions.size(); ++idx)
 VizGhar: what? o.O
 VizGhar: silly indeed
 struct: I'm sure there is some geometry stuff
 struct: to check if a line intercepts a circle
 struct: or something
 Illedan: LOL
 Illedan: that code
 Scarfield: sounds impossible struct, nobel prize winning difficulty
 VizGhar: for 8000 angles? :P there is for loop inside :D
 LostDragon: anyone else having troubles with playing ide code leading to unreproductible timeouts?
 struct: are you starting the timer on the right spot?
 Q12: Scarfield I'm just working on it, think I found a way
 Scarfield: :o
 yhyoxx: i thought it was isThreat()=&gt;direction.intersects(base) 
 VizGhar: If it's working...
 LostDragon: I have had timeouts at 5 different turns depending on the replays i did, all with the same seed, and 2 of which with an ai strait from the arena that seemed to work for the whole afternoon
 struct: LostDragon how much time are you using per turn?
 VizGhar: or you didn't end your output with newline
 cegprakash: I just added something crazy :D
 cegprakash: I get crazy farm now
 jacek: :scream:
 cegprakash: what jacek
 VizGhar: he lost his mind from your crazyness
 cegprakash: so beautiful to watch my bot xD
 cegprakash: at elast the defenders
 msumera: show the replay then&#160;:)
 cegprakash: anyone has a seed with too many monsters
 cegprakash: I'll share replay

 cegprakash: check last 70 turns
 cegprakash: crazy defense with 2 heroes
 cegprakash: while my attacking hero does nothing ;P need to improve
 VizGhar: one shield and your defense is dead :P
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: true
 iTsluku: move 214 top right is funny
 iTsluku: hahaha
 msumera: you could also let them come a bit closer in the beginning and save some mana&#160;:)
 VizGhar: cegprakash just random play against you :P <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623157378">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623157378</a>
 cegprakash: lolx
 cegprakash: both my defenders sux
 cegprakash: lol
 cegprakash: nice strat
 cegprakash: how are u only 315 with this strat
 cegprakash: looks legit
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623158827">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623158827</a> just random play against you VizGhar

 PatrickMcGinnisII: interesting
 cegprakash: guys wait for my shield
 cegprakash: -_-
 cegprakash: wait for my attacker to improve
 VizGhar: :D gogo
 msumera: ok, me too <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623159953">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623159953</a>
 Nerchio: VizGhar bugs walk into your base like its their home
 WannaBeHum1n: wait 4 me to get top 1 with a peaceful run
 iTsluku: Nerchio u are top100 with only defense? lul
 VizGhar: Nerchio its bot from first day of contest
 Nerchio: iTsluku yeah offense is overrated
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dropped 500 rank overnight
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gonna see if i can get them back
 iTsluku: Nerchio i found a bug on your end
 iTsluku: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623163395">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623163395</a>
 Nerchio: yeah I just introduced this
 Nerchio: already fixed submitting again
 Nerchio: now you can lose without me crashing
 cegprakash: I fixed my attack
 cegprakash: now give replays if u guys dare :P
 msumera: ok, just wait a minute
 Nerchio: you need to be in top 1000 cegprakash i think
 cegprakash: 1 sec
 cegprakash: check now I'm in top 1000 now
 cegprakash: refresh leaderboard
 msumera: ok, it's running
 cegprakash: my attacker is kinda bad against 3 defenders
 cegprakash: it'll be nice to compare against ppl with 1 attacker, 2 defenders
 cegprakash: coz mine is 1 attacker, 2 defender
 msumera: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623167342">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623167342</a>
 Nerchio: how about you stop bugs from walking into your base first
 msumera: i also have 1 attacker, 2 defenders
 JaredH: all attackers
 Tuo: is it possible to check if your hero is/was under control with the isControlled parameter?
 cegprakash: msumera ty I think I need to add more wind :P
 Tuo: im trying but it never triggers
 msumera: your attacker could also control them to come into my base range
 msumera: i also noticed i have a lot of bugs with incorrect spells
 msumera: need to fix that tomorrow
 DjTrilogic: has anyone tried to generate the json result and put it in the server's file to speed up the simulation&#160;? 
 DjTrilogic: i'm getting a weird error: The cacheId "$0" does not exist in TextureCache.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: got my rank back, but yall need to stop working so hard, i'm barely keeping up
 Greg237: @cegprakash I believe your attacker would be a bit more efficient by using WIND on groups of monsters instead of shielding them individually.
 cegprakash: @Greg237 I'm just trying butcher2013's meta
 cegprakash: he lead bronze for over a day
 Greg237: Well, if I remember well, Butcher's not only using the shield.
 Greg237: But anyway, it's indeed a good strategy trying to reproduce what the top 1 is doing.&#160;;-)
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623172335">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623172335</a> did this guy just use 3 attackers and won against me lulul
 cegprakash: some ppl are crazy
 msumera: lol, the wind cannon
 cegprakash: turn 77 he went savage
 cegprakash: he done with the boring defense
 Einbroch: that kind of cheese is easily counterable lol
 msumera: if you know what he might do
 msumera: no one expects that 3 defenders will just go and shoot monsters to base from 7000 distance
 Einbroch: if you have a good defense you clearly can see it coming
 Einbroch: 10 mana to avoid it is cheap compared to the price the opponent pays (loss)
 cegprakash: he saw I was defending his base by stealing his monsters and he came for 3 member attack lul
 cegprakash: crazy
 msumera: i don't think anyone has defence good enough to counter that now
 msumera: but its easy to counter that just by counter attacking, the base has no defenders
 cegprakash: he came in fog
 cegprakash: :P
 cegprakash: and suddenly bang
 Tuo: to my previus question if "isControlled" works for own heroes: it does but because you are under control you cant do shit on that turn, need to wait for next to shield&#160;:)
 antiwonto: [auto] Tuo be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 Einbroch: @Tuo or next turn's next turn if your opponent keeps controlling you lol
 Tuo: oh didnt think of that. what is the counter? or they can just escort any hero across the map?
 VizGhar: prevention Tuo&#160;:)
 msumera: escorting you across the map means that basically both you and the enemy doesn't have a hero, and additionally he loses mana
 msumera: so it's not that good
 LaurensD: what! you can use control on enemy heroes?
 LaurensD: interesting
 msumera: yep, it's working pretty good against defenders
 Rag: when does silver open?
 Audatic: tomorrow in about 20 hours
 Audatic: probably more like 16
 BrunoFelthes: is there any way to calculate the max allowed distance without use square root or sin/cos to improve the performance?
 Rag: ty
 LostDragon: don't do square root, just compare square distances
 BrunoFelthes: but i want to find the point where is the max distance, not if is inside the max distance
 LostDragon: the greatest distance from  a certain point?
 Psyho: just add 1 while you're inside the max distance, problem solved
 BrunoFelthes: for example, my hero is at the 0,0, and i move it to 1000, 1000, but he will not move to it, it will move a max of 800, where is this point
 jacek: do you use search to need optimization?
 jacek: doubt sqrt is bottleneck there
 BrunoFelthes: how can i calculate the final point?
 ArnoCo: Why is no one in Silver?
 BrunoFelthes: yes jacek
 VizGhar: BrunoFelthes x = 800*cos(); y=800*sin()
 BrunoFelthes: but cos() and sin() is very expense... no optimization here?
 jacek: precaculate them&#160;:?
 VizGhar: ... well precompute all 360 values
 LostDragon: you seem to be looking for this google search: normalize vector without square rooti should've remembered that one earlier
 BrunoFelthes: and limit to move only 1' 
 BrunoFelthes: fair enough
 VizGhar: for (angle&#160;: 0..359) sin[angle] = sin(angle)...
 LostDragon: quake had an algorithm for lightning fast square root computations
 Waffle3z: fast inverse square root
 Psyho: the improvement was huge but for very old architecture
 Psyho: (and imprecise)
 VizGhar: precompute all square roots!!!
 MAKMED1337: how long to wait to be promoted to next league&#160;?
 iTsluku: my top left start win% are so much better wtf
 VizGhar: you forgot mirror something :P
 iTsluku: @MAKMED1337 idk its kinda random
 iTsluku: dont see it tho
 xMizar: Hi all, do we have anyone from Codingame team here? I think i found a bug with Wind spell
 xMizar: Would like to discuss it
 RECEBA: Can someone please tell me how do I start moving the players, Im using JS
 ganbat24: Examples: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44521be0-6f4f-4576-a916-d1301cdc5de0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/44521be0-6f4f-4576-a916-d1301cdc5de0</a>
 cegprakash: BrunoFelthes: MOVE followed by two integers (x,y): the hero moves 800 towards the given point.
 ganbat24: at mos
 cegprakash: BrunoFelthes use the symmetrical truncate function in referee it's pretty simple to copy paste
 BrunoFelthes: it uses sqrt, no?
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2288b1ba-dfa4-410e-9843-66b5e8bd862a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2288b1ba-dfa4-410e-9843-66b5e8bd862a</a>
 cegprakash: I use this
 BrunoFelthes: i used it, and he normalize, and to normalize, the referee use the length, that use the sqrt...
 LaurensD: Haha this guy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623202853">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623202853</a>
 ganbat24: bruh how did u loose to that guy?
 LaurensD: don't have shields plus all are on my base at the moment lol 
 cegprakash: lol sc2_viag is like "U shall not pass"
 JohnyDaison: Is Silver finally open or still not?
 archfan7411: Not yet AFAIK
 sc2_viag: Am I? lol Testing a few things :D
 ganbat24: nope they were not all there 1 was at base
 LaurensD: silver opens in 20 hours from now; as far I have recently heard
 ganbat24: i didnt have time to use wind&#160;;(
 ganbat24: Guess ill try it for a couple hours after kickstart
 ganbat24: How to create text messages mid game?
 ganbat24: on top of my hereos
 archfan7411: append them to the end of commands
 archfan7411: e.g. SPELL WIND 100 100 Yay
 ganbat24: oooh okay
 avdg: hmm not sure how well other ai's are here, but mine does almost everything in less than 1 ms or even half a ms each turn
 avdg: and after fixing a bug, it's reaching around rank 500 (ai is still not using some spells)
 Thibauld: Does anyone know the speed of the heroes?
 Davidceto: 800
 Davidceto: per turn
 Thibauld: Thanks

 ycsvenom: anyone has a blank screen when they make a test?
 ycsvenom: i tried to refresh the page with ctrl+f5 but it didn't work
 avdg: did you open the developer tools and look for js errors?
 ycsvenom: this is the major error
 ycsvenom: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'resize')
 avdg: I see no other major errors here otherwise though
 ycsvenom: i have that one too
 ycsvenom: in the last line it said 'Possibly unhandled rejection' 
 avdg: Do you use chrome or firefox?
 ycsvenom: chrome
 avdg: recent? (I'm on firefox, so dunno if there are specific bugs)
 ycsvenom: it worked before just half hour
 avdg: and it's just the canvas that broke?
 ycsvenom: yes
 avdg: may be video driver related, otherwise I don't know
 avdg: worst case, computer restart (yeah sounds drastic, but had done it a few times in the past)
 VizGhar: You have these problems often right ycsvenom?
 avdg: maybe browser restart may be enough, dunno
 ycsvenom: no this is the first time VizGhar
 avdg: and maybe there was a server update (though, if you didn't refresh the page...)
 ycsvenom: i can't do that avdg
 VizGhar: really? there were somebody with similar error... without solution
 VizGhar: *was
 ycsvenom: i refreshed it already with ctrl+f5
 avdg: mostly, when I have video driver related issues, youtube also stops working
 Nerchio: it's kinda stupid you can't push on y = 0 or x =0 vector when monster is also y = 0 or x = 0
 ycsvenom: btw frames still loading even the output still runningthe only thing that isn't working rn is the canvas
 Ch3oul: Hello guys, when will the silver league open?
 avdg: Soon I guess, it's mostly only max a few days after the opening
 avdg: I've seen some bugs with displaying the opening date, they probably removed the date in the user interface for now
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623238782">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623238782</a> 120turn+ wtf?
 struct: you are using wind a bit to the top
 struct: which makes the spider hits the top
 struct: and since its 0
 Nerchio: what do you mean, I cast for y=5
 struct: ah
 Nerchio: trying to push it away
 struct: but your hero
 struct: is not at 0
 struct: your hero y
 Nerchio: I thought it didnt matter where my hero is 
 struct: it does
 struct: its in relation to your hero position
 Nerchio: ok time to go back to the drawing board
 ycsvenom: VizGhar it worked nowchrome suddenly has a new update i don't why it has that weird behavior before updating
 Husoski: My first competition and my first clean compile/test bot just made it to bronze.  This is all simple if/else logic.  When does serious AI become necessary?
 BrunoFelthes: huahauhua
 BrunoFelthes: are you top 10?
 Kukiss: For the moment a Bronze is the highest league.
 VizGhar: Husoski good job. You made heuristic bot. You can use it to simulate opponent movements and write serious AI that beats your heuristic...
 VizGhar: that's sometimes how it works&#160;:) you can write GA/SA algos to find best step in order to hit most mobs at once. You can write BFS/Beam to select one step from your "collection of allowed steps" and so on
 VizGhar: But if this is your first competition, I doubt, you will move far from if/else statement&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: That's was a bait I think... XD
 Kukiss: I see that 34 lvl now..
 Husoski: VizGhar Thanks for the suggestion.  It feels more like "basic strategy" than "heuristic", though.  I wen't and looked at the intro video later and found I was doing some of the same stuff as  he was.
 Husoski: Kukiss --- lots of puzzles solved to get that 34, not competitions.
 VizGhar: bait? why? I just answered... I'm if/elsing too right now...
 VizGhar: But will for sure use some optim algo later on (if there will be some time)
 VizGhar: seeing how I'm missing good hits
 Kellthazar: No from you VizGhar, just kidding also :D
 Westicles: the dumb guys who try hard usually get stuck in silver
 Husoski: Dang!  Fog of war *helped* my strategy!
 VizGhar: yup... I'm mid gold guy by default&#160;:) I know algos, but can't use them properly :D
 Kukiss: Husoski, competitions are the best. Even if don't get high ranks, it is nice to take part in a challange every1 talks about here. Good you tried&#160;:)
 Kukiss: Husoski, competitions are the best. Even I if don't get high ranks, it is nice to take part in a challange every1 talks about here. Good you tried&#160;:)
 Westicles: this one is good for the little guy... not just a mcts rollout competition
 struct: The vx and vy are only updated 2 turns after the control spell is casted?
 struct: but the isThreat is updated 1 turn after?
 struct: seems a bit of a mess
 m7sn: how do i do this
 VizGhar: finally got 2 hrs to code something... I wonder how much I'll drop in ladder :P
 Kellthazar: i think that I got some improvement on my algorithm... but I'm afraid to push it to the arena :D
 VizGhar: meh... you got 11 days dont be scared
 VizGhar: You will see how the situation will saddle after gold boss introduction
 struct: VizGhar do you know if what I described is intended
 struct: Its a bit strange
 VizGhar: ah... sry I've not deep dived into sources
 struct: its fine
 struct: I'll make a forum post asking
 struct: Because it doesnt make much sense that one updates and other doesnt
 VizGhar: CONTROL spells are applied to the targets and will only be effective on the next turn, after the next batch of commands.SHIELD spells are applied to the targets and will only be effective on the next turn, after the next batch of commands. Does not protect from a spell from this same turn.
 struct: yeah
 struct: but threat_for is updated
 struct: despite vx and vy still remaining the same
 VizGhar: very strange hmm

 cegprakash: WIND animation is 2 seconds?
 cegprakash: 2 turns?
 struct: no?
 struct: its 1 turn cegprakash
 struct: its instant
 cegprakash: I mean the animation duration
 struct: its 1 frame
 cegprakash: it look like after we use WIND first turn only pushes half distance then half distance in next turn
 struct: nah
 JulienKerlero: I feel stuck
 cegprakash: may be we get wrong velocity when we use wind
 cegprakash: instead of 1200 we get smaller velocity then
 cegprakash: like 400
 struct: you dont get velocity at all
 struct: because its casted between 2 turns
 cegprakash: when we blow wind it's velocity becomes 0 for a turn?
 struct: it wont impact next vx or vy
 struct: during the wind only
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623287478">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623287478</a>
 cegprakash: say I print WIND next turn the position I get in input would be position + velocity + 1200 and the new velocity will be 0?
 struct: look at frame 21 and 22
 struct: I casted wind 1000 6570
 struct: the spider 13 x will go from -330 to 1870
 ycsvenom: how do people change nametag
 struct: On your profile
 ycsvenom: it will be perfect for testing
 cegprakash: debugger only show position not velocity
 struct: the velocity doenst change at all
 struct: unless you pushed it into a basew
 struct: or outside the base
 ycsvenom: which profile?
 struct: your profile
 ycsvenom:  i mean hero nametag
 struct: ah
 struct: just cout &lt;&lt; "WAIT message" &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: space after command and then the message you want
 ycsvenom: the last parameter would be the message?
 struct: yes
 ycsvenom: thanks
 ycsvenom: what is the maximum league rn?
 JulienKerlero: bronze
 ycsvenom: so i am in the maximum oneis it good that i am 1492nd?
 JulienKerlero: depends on you lol
 ycsvenom: that hurts 
 Enknable: its good to stay in the front of the pack. I think
 Enknable: lots of heuristics so you can be closer to the emerging "meta"?
 JulienKerlero: I would be happy in the top 200
 Enknable: but eventually the Legends just gonna start dropping Terminator level shit

 Einbroch: :cop:
 Phibonacci: Can we fight our friends or do we both need to be top 1000 for that?
 Enknable: same league I think
 Phibonacci: The three of us are in Bronze but we can't see each other.
 Phibonacci: 2 of my friends could fight each other yesterday when they were both top 1000, so we assumed it might be a strange restriction
 struct: yeah need to be 1000th
 struct: of same league
 Enknable: dang
 ycsvenom: i am 1400 in bronze
 ycsvenom: i can't get better
 ycsvenom: what's your rank struct?
 MACKEYTH: You can do it!
 Kukiss: You still have a plenty of time
 struct: 1860
 struct: I havent coded anything yet
 struct: No motivation
 ycsvenom: you are waiting for silver or gold&#160;?
 struct: I dont know yet
 ycsvenom: no i can't MACKEYTH
 JohnyDaison: I used to be around rank 600. I kept working on my code and now I'm like 1100. :D
 MACKEYTH: High five. I'm in the same boat.
 ycsvenom: wonderful JohnyDaison :joy:work hard more and you will be at 1600 
 Kukiss: Finally! gave my units a Wind spell and it kinda works in defense.
 ycsvenom: 1498 before wind1360 after windso i say push itif you are sure about your wind implementation
 cr1: this i a cool website tbh
 ycsvenom: you made it cool after you got in cr1
 struct: Kukiss on 600th you should be safe
 struct: for promotion
 Kukiss: ok, cool
 ycsvenom: can i challenge specific one&#160;?so i can send it's parameters to IDE and debug on it
 ycsvenom: like challenging the first from beginning 
 JohnyDaison: yes
 ycsvenom: how?
 JohnyDaison: just delete the the one that DOESN'T say IDE CODE from Players
 JohnyDaison: then add who you want
 mybk: you can also, check your last battles and debug a specific battle by clicking on show «the battle» and click the «Send Game PArametesrs To IDE»

 cegprakash: last 20 turns
 JohnyDaison: Why si your attacker not moving?
 struct: no mana
 struct: it only seems to use wind
 ycsvenom: i don't to check my last battlesi want to challenge the first one and debug on that game
 cegprakash: JohnyDaison he likes to chill
 cegprakash: lol
 Ajaiy: cegprakash are you in Bronze league?
 cegprakash: aye aye Ajaiy
 JohnyDaison: ycsvenom did you manage to do it or were my instructions unclear?
 cegprakash: after 100 turns expectations = 300+ mana like Butcher.. Reality =&gt; 10 mana

 Glyptod0n: so you can't control which hero to commit the action by using their id huh
 JohnyDaison: you control that by the order of actions
 Ketroc: na, but if you keep them in an ordered list it shouldn't be an issue
 MACKEYTH: The first order you give goes to the first of your heroes in the entity list, the second to the second, and the third to the third
 Glyptod0n: thanks
 struct: the entity order given of the lists is ordered right?
 struct: entity order of the heroes*
 MACKEYTH: Yes
 struct: ty
 Ajaiy: wait what
 Ajaiy: How do i share replays?
 Ajaiy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/623333340">https://www.codingame.com/replay/623333340</a>
 cr1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/MGerNLnCXa9y">https://prnt.sc/MGerNLnCXa9y</a>  like how i can do that XD
 Ajaiy: I'm super confused
 Ajaiy: Is this a bug or am I not realizing something?
 struct: What is a bug Ajaiy?
 Ajaiy: I scored more mana than Astrobytes in the replay (it shows like that) but it says that AStrobytes won

 Glyptod0n: their wild mana is greater than yours
 Ajaiy: ohhhh i get it
 Glyptod0n: In case of a tie, you have gained the highest amount of wild mana: mana gained outside the radius of your base. 
 Ajaiy: so wild mana is mana remaining + mana used?
 struct: no
 Glyptod0n: no, please see Victory Conditions section
 struct: its mana you collected from the enemies you attack with your heroes that are outside your base
 Ayza: how do you print without interfering with the program execution?
 Ajaiy: okay
 Ajaiy: thanks
 struct: print to stderr
 struct: default code should tell you how
 Ayza: alright thanks
 JohnyDaison: I feel like they made the documentation too inconspicuous under that game window, people don't seem to be reading it much.
 struct: Some documentation is confusing though
 JohnyDaison: I finally added an attacker, let's see me drop another few hundred ranks...
 JohnyDaison: Nope, I'm back to top 1000. Yay!
 ClockSort: congrats

 Ajaiy: JohnnyDaison Thanks for the extra help
 JohnyDaison: Yeah, the attacker needs a bit more work...

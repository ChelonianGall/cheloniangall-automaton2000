 thethiny: are there actual bots playing Clash of Code?
 cs540: probably 
 5DN1L: yes
 thethiny: weird
 5DN1L: check out the leaderboard of Clash of Code
 5DN1L: and sort by number of plays
 thethiny: mind pointing me with a link?
 5DN1L: then you'll know which are bots
 zakacat: Are they the ones using Pyhton 3 and finishing in 4.5 seconds?
 cs540: i mean you could make a problem solver with python and let it grind leaderboards

 5DN1L: the bots are used to fill slots when too few humans join a clash
 thethiny: thanks
 5DN1L: np
 syedii: Print a word containing n times the nth letter of the alphabet (uppercase) in c
 zakacat: The more you know! :rainbow:
 syedii: how to do it in C 
 syedii: like in python its straight forward
 syedii: but how in c
 syedii: Print a word containing n times the nth letter of the alphabet (uppercase) 
 zakacat: A real word?
 struct: a loop?
 syedii: yes
 struct: for (int i = 0; i &lt; times; ++i)fprintf("%c", 'a'+char_index);
 struct: something like that
 cs540: make a string with all the letters of the alphabet
 struct: i forgot stdout
 thethiny: for (int i = 0; i &lt; time; i++)
 struct: C not c++
 thethiny: int i = 0;for (i; i &lt; time; i++)
 syedii: ahan so I make a string of all alphabets then using array of that string I determine the number of it&#160;?
 struct: you dont really need an array
 struct: if you print 'A'+position it will return the letter
 kunajk: \:)
 syedii: right&#160;!

 jacek: you can use any variable to store ;d
 Razovsky: well, if i have many of these and i want to store everything
 Razovsky: im kinda rusty
 jacek: use array/list/vector or group them into classes or structs
 Razovsky: ha, class, thats right
 Razovsky: i should revise this

 5DN1L: that's many
 Razovsky: 4 bots&#160;?
 Razovsky: never got that much
 Razovsky: 3 is my best
 Razovsky: the japanese, the french and the canadian
 Razovsky: seems like the beginning of a western, or a joke
 zakacat: Grab :taco:
 5DN1L: interesting, I've never checked the bots' nationality before
 zakacat: Give :taco: jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] zakacat has awarded jacek 2 tacos. jacek now has 3 taco. zakacat now has 27 taco
 thethiny: üåÆ
 thethiny: how many üåÆ do I have
 thethiny: ü§î
 5DN1L: go to #taco channel and type "taco power" to check
 zakacat: You gotta throw em to know
 zakacat: jk
 zakacat: don't throw em
 thethiny: lol thanks
 thethiny: is there like a guide or something on how the taco thingy works
 thethiny: what are the commands and so on
 5DN1L: yes, i have to look it up though
 5DN1L: forgotten what to type for that
 thethiny: alright
 5DN1L: check #taco channel for the answer, thethiny
 GoondaCoding: sup cockers
 5DN1L: I hope you aren't meaning anything bad, GoondaCoding :unamused:
 Razovsky: hey antiwonto do you know you will die soon&#160;?&#160;:( 
 Razovsky: chat is terminated
 5DN1L: Yes, Wontonimo said he wasn't going to transfer the bot to discord
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 will probably face the same fate
 Automaton2000: i was referring to the fact that i have a bug
 thethiny: is the bot open source?
 5DN1L: You can check its profile for a link to the blog describing its creation
 5DN1L: the blog also contains a link to the source code
 5DN1L: i mean for Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: that way i can use a one-hot + embedding layer to dynamically choose which rows to inject into the network ...

 eulerscheZahl: but i can type with both hands again
 therealbeef: damn
 eulerscheZahl: still using the left hand for the mouse
 eulerscheZahl: i seriously consider to quit soccer alltogether&#160;:(
 Tien118: :cry:
 eulerscheZahl: the atcoder problem looked really cool, i wish i could play
 jacek: still you can play :notebook: :soccer:
 eulerscheZahl: not funny
 jacek:&#160;:(
 Tien118: :disappointed_relieved:
 struct: I also had to quit due to injuries
 struct: too many in a short time span
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, at some point you have to reconsider if it's worth it
 therealbeef: ouch, bit unlucky, football usually involves knee/leg injuries, then at least you can still code (but still annoying)
 eulerscheZahl: 5 months with some ankle injury. just recovered, a few matches and bam, next injury
 eulerscheZahl: i've ordered a new bicycle a few months ago, should be ready soon
 eulerscheZahl: time for a less risky hobby
 struct: road bike?
 coder1404: taco
 eulerscheZahl: and coding contests, only dangerous for your mental health
 eulerscheZahl: tracking bike
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like streets with cars. but not mountain biking either, that's scary
 KuroHyou: tracking bike or track bike?
 struct: oh so you are going to ride on a track?
 eulerscheZahl: just through the forest
 KuroHyou: cycling through the forest, isn't that risky too?

 eulerscheZahl: first that popped up on google for "waldweg"
 struct: Are you sure its a track bike?
 struct: track bike have no breaks
 KuroHyou: i'm guessing it's more of a trail bike or a gravel bike
 eulerscheZahl: in germany we call them tracking bike. i guess we like to use wrong english terms

 stifal: hi
 TheHotCheesecake_a3be: hello
 jacek: ohai
 Leeward: Is there a way to prevent the standard error stream from truncating really long outputs?
 5DN1L: no
 therealbeef: zipping it?
 5DN1L: you have to work out how to change the output
 5DN1L: or compress it 
 5DN1L: as a workaround
 therealbeef: or just run your program on your own computer
 Leeward: That's a bit annoying if I need to use it to display a grid
 Leeward: I can't really compress it further
 5DN1L: compress by encoding, then decoding offline
 Leeward: what a schlep
 Leeward: I think I'm going to call it on this challenge then, getting to the point where I need a clear idea of what's happening after 100+ rounds
 5DN1L: or just test everything offline as therealbeef said
 Leeward: I can't, it's the reverse engineering challenge
 5DN1L: oh that one
 Leeward: I know what's happening but I need to fine-tune my solution and I can't do that if I can't see half of what's going on
 therealbeef: if your program is iterative, you could start printing diagnostics only after certain number of iterations, and then tweak a bit until you hit the interesting one
 Leeward: hmm difficult to tell when that is if the behaviour is non-deterministic
 Leeward: Eh I'm over it. It was fun to figure out but AI isn't my strong suit so I think I'll leave it at that.
 struct: Leeward lots of people just run the code locally
 jacek: what AI
 Leeward: struct do you mean with the chrome extension?
 struct: no, I just copy my state and paste it on ide
 Leeward: that doesn't help when it has to interact with input from a black box like in the bot programming games
 5DN1L: and no referee available for reverse engineering puzzle
 5DN1L: there are referees for other bot games so testing offline is possible
 Leeward: But hardly needed if when there's a UI and you can see all the debug outputs
 5DN1L: subject to limit of number of code submissions though
 MSmits: Leeward try to look at the input you get when you try various outputs, use debug messages and pen and paper
 MSmits: it's not that hard to figure out what's happening. Especially if you have done other games on CG
 StevenV: u
 struct: Finally finished the sim I think now I can work on eval, lets see if I can finish the eval before chat is gone :p
 jacek: what sim
 struct: Stc
 antiwonto: [auto] 'stc' was defined as ' Smash The Code <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code</a> '
 StevenV: Hello guys
 StevenV: which problem are you on struct?
 struct: hi
 struct: well antiwonto just linked it
 StevenV: oh
 StevenV: I still trying to def my top 100 position on spider attack&#160;:(
 StevenV: my rank drop to 200 after a week
 StevenV: csb
 antiwonto: [auto] 'CSB' was defined as ' Coders Strikes Back (aka Mad Pod Racing) '
 StevenV: mpr
 MSmits: mmh should play more boardgames. Your rank can't drop that much then
 StevenV: I mean top of the game
 StevenV: the top on CG isn't drop too much like that
 MSmits: top of the game?
 StevenV: top of spiderAttack
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I got that
 MSmits: I meant, if you play a boardgame, your rank wont drop as much as it will over time on spiders&#160;:)
 StevenV: the game is too random, and there are anti strategy with Heuristic
 StevenV: ah
 MSmits: yeah spiders seems a pretty chaotic game with a chaotic leaderboard
 StevenV: boardgame use some AI algor, which I am not good at
 StevenV: I am the one of Heuristic
 struct: well you can learn it
 MSmits: ah, well they are not that hard to learn if you start simple
 struct: mcts sounds harder than it is
 MSmits: if you can understand a simple pathfinding algorithm like bfs, you could also do a minimax
 MSmits: minimax is probably easier than mcts
 struct: Start simple with normal Tic tac toe
 StevenV: I plan to go legend on fall2020 which is my first contest on CG
 struct: it is, but mcts is not complicated either imo
 StevenV: still in silver though
 MSmits: what is fall2020 again?
 struct: the potion one
 MSmits: oh ok
 struct: the witches
 struct: I used beam search on that one
 StevenV: ah, yes the witches
 struct: a wrong implementation of it
 MSmits: never made a serious bot for that
 struct: and it still worked
 MSmits: yeah semi-broken algo can work&#160;:)
 struct: on beam search usually you choose the path to the best last state right?
 struct: when you reach the depth you want
 MSmits: yeah
 StevenV: I've read some blog about MCTS though, but not yet success to implement it.
 MSmits: well you're only interested in the first move on that path really. You dont need the entire path
 struct: yeah my algo checked the first move but for each depth
 MSmits: there's examples on CG, euler made a playground i think?
 MSmits: (for mcts)
 struct: the first move that started the state at the current depth
 struct: so if I had 20 depth it would score the best for each depth
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: and then choose the one at the end that was most common
 MSmits: I use BS in the cooking game and in hypersonic
 MSmits: oh and in the game with the trees
 MSmits: some parts of that ocean game too
 StevenV: does BS simpler than MCTS to implement?
 struct: yes
 MSmits: yeah but not suitable for boardgames. BS is mostly a single player search
 MSmits: not adversarial like minimax or mcts
 MSmits: you don't assume your opponent is always making the best countermove
 StevenV: thanks
 MSmits: you just assume some moves based on heuristics at the most
 MSmits: (for the opponent)
 StevenV: can we use BS for opponment too?
 MSmits: yes, but then your guy is using heuristics
 MSmits: the two players can't react to eachothers decisions
 MSmits: you need minimax/mcts for that
 StevenV: ah
 MSmits: hypersonic (= bomberman) is a game where BS is nice, because you are mostly interested in blowing up boxes to get points. The opponents are ignored most of the time except when death is imminent
 struct: you can also try it on search race
 MSmits: yeah it's great for optimizations because it is single player
 Washier: BS = beam search?
 StevenV: well, I am focusing on the witches
 MSmits: yes Washier
 struct: yes
 Washier: ty
 StevenV: so I think MCTS would be better
 jacek: witches is esentially single player
 struct: you can ignore opponent
 MSmits: if you want to know whether or not you can ignore opponent, ask yourself whether you best move is dependent on the opponents choices
 StevenV: humm
 MSmits: or at least, how often this is the case
 Washier: can confirm, i did ok with just heuristics in witches
 waterproofsodium: gm
 struct: hi
 iydbhkz: Is there any easy learing software
 Molo94: i have a test in a week
 StevenV: you can learn a lot in one week if you have good background IMHO
 jacek: maybe easy learning websites
 Molo94: i know the basics quite well and worked a programming job before 
 MSmits: If you want to practice, just go to the practice section and solve puzzles
 MSmits: there's hundreds
 thethiny: @55DN1L thanks for your reply. I didn't notice
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: last minute random submit passed, totally didn't expect that \o/
 struct: nice, are there more rounds?
 eulerscheZahl: only the finals
 eulerscheZahl: i'm miles away
 eulerscheZahl: at least 45 points today, i'm happy. just with a poor penalty time where i could have done better
 eulerscheZahl: spent an hour on the one problem i couldn't solve, returned to the 3rd and submitted some bogus that surprisingly gave partial points
 eulerscheZahl: might be interesting for MSmits<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/00000000008779b4/0000000000b4518a">https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/00000000008779b4/0000000000b4518a</a>

 eulerscheZahl: it's loud
 MSmits: aha
 struct: why does he use it every week?
 eulerscheZahl: because he's annoying i guess
 eulerscheZahl: definitely has too much time. he works as a graphics designer
 eulerscheZahl: yet i rely on BenjaminUrquhart for an Onitama shrine
 eulerscheZahl: final results are out: #303 at codejam
 struct: Nice
 eulerscheZahl: not great, not bad
 jacek: onitama shrine?
 eulerscheZahl: 230-ish without getting stuck on D...
 eulerscheZahl: exactly. he promised a shrine asset and never delivered
 eulerscheZahl: now chat will die, so i can't ask him again
 jacek: so thats why my bot sometimes loses
 MSmits: when will chat die?
 MSmits: and where will we go?
 struct: this month
 MSmits: did they give a reason for this? 
 Zeffuro: Probably more work moderating multiple chat points

 jacek: you can only play around in contribution's ide
 NachSN: sorry for all the questions but how do I enter contributions ide?
 NachSN: idc if it's solo or a clash
 NachSN: I just want to solve the thing lol
 jacek: what's the link

 NachSN: it's the gold rush one
 jacek: go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/504269c6bc5fb486f931d6b31d4e0c33ffb1">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/504269c6bc5fb486f931d6b31d4e0c33ffb1</a> and click test in ide
 NachSN: wow! thanks again!
 NachSN: just for next time because I bet this is going to happen a lot
 NachSN: how do I do that myself?
 jacek: if you click gold rush it will expand and there will be view contribution on CodinGame to click
 NachSN: I see, thanks :D
 NachSN: maan
 NachSN: I solved it but didn't submit it cause I was confused how things work
 NachSN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/QQuK4PSywZy9">https://prnt.sc/QQuK4PSywZy9</a>
 NachSN: sad
 jacek: but you solved it eventually :tada:
 Ayza: actually where even is the submit button
 NachSN: I didn't find it either lmao I just finished it and didn't really care about submitting
 jacek: its just conttribution, you cant submit there
 jacek: even the search for finished clashes is on the courtesy of eulerscheZahl, its not official
 NachSN: idk if it's allowed to ask such things but in Mad Pod Racing what's the best angle at which you'd want to start boosting your thrust up?
 NachSN: if it's not allowed just ignore :P
 NachSN: or better tell me it's not allowed
 jacek: everything is allowed
 jacek: you want boost only if youre quite far away from target
 NachSN: oh sorry not boost
 NachSN: I mean ramping your thrust up
 NachSN: right now I use 110 / -110
 jacek: what league
 NachSN: wood1 just started haha
 jacek: thrust can be only in [0,100] :thinking:
 NachSN: yeah I mean
 NachSN: I set my thrust to 0 if angle to next checkpoint is &gt;110 or &lt;-110
 NachSN: but these probably aren't the best values
 NachSN: also 1 more thing... is "nextcheckpointdist" the current distance from me to the next checkpoint or is it the distance from previous checkpoint to next?
 jacek: AFAIR its 0 if angle is &lt; -90 or &gt; 90
 jacek: and 100 the rest
 NachSN: aight i'll use that then
 jacek: you and next checkpoint
 NachSN: oh wow so it's constantly updating? :O
 jacek: if you move, yes ~
 NachSN: wow that's great
 NachSN: thanks again&#160;:)
 jacek: no proble
 jacek: m

 Sephirious: Hello everyone, I am trying to open a local HTML file on my chrome but it does not run it, just show the code. But mozilla and other browsers can open it. Anyone has idea&#160;?
 jacek: weird. chromium opens html as html for me
 ElJafar: start dood
 Constant-Time: run it
 Ayza: maybe you're using something not supported in chromium?
 Sephirious: How can I run it
 Ayza: but I guess that wouldn't show the code
 Sephirious: It just shows the html code like notebook
 Sephirious: Its just a file like Hello World
 Sephirious: I can see the output like how it should be at Mozilla
 Sephirious: I tried adding local file///* to html run exception on Chrome but it is still not running

 antiwonto: [auto] Hey NachSN, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 NachSN: idk what to do
 NachSN: it is broken
 NachSN: won't skip a line
 struct: you are printing an extra \n
 struct: try Console.Write(x);
 struct: instead
 NachSN: explain it to me
 NachSN: it worked
 NachSN: but i don't get it
 struct: so you were adding a \n at the end
 struct: so lets say they gave you the string "hi"
 struct: and you had to output it three times
 struct: x at the end of the loop would be
 NachSN: hihihi
 struct: hi\nhi\nhi\n
 NachSN: oh what
 NachSN: why
 struct: But console.writeline writes another \n
 struct: at the end
 struct: so it would become

 struct: hihihi

 NachSN: ohhhh
 NachSN: I see

 zakacat: Struct, question
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey zakacat, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 28 tacos
 struct: yes?
 zakacat: I am testing out different languages (finally) and I noticed that python seems to compile the fastest, but I thought it was a slower language compared to say Java which is my primary language
 zakacat: Is that possible? Or is that just a coincidental observation?
 struct: compilation time is irrelevant for language performance
 struct: I mean sure it might have some impact on performance
 struct: But py3 compiling faster than c++ or java doesnt make it a faster language
 zakacat: ahh, okay, so why might all the test cases load faster?
 zakacat: with python
 struct: because the compilation is faster
 struct: not the language itself
 zakacat: oh, okay
 zakacat: Is that only because of this IDE or is this common?
 struct: Also depends on the size of your code
 struct: maybe size is not the right word
 zakacat: length?
 struct: Yeah but its not a good metric
 struct: But I would not worry too much about compilation time
 zakacat: Java is my first language, so I usually write quite opulently, lol
 zakacat: Sure, okay, I just thought it was weird that it loaded so much faster than Java or Kotlin
 zakacat: maybe the IDE is written in Python
 zakacat: I dunno
 struct: no
 struct: if you try js it is also fast
 zakacat: ah , alright, thanx
 zakacat: give :taco: struct

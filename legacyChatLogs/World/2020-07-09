 JuliaPhan: i'm sorry
 WINWINWIN: Like people from India have #In , France has #Fr
 WINWINWIN: No problem JuliaPhan
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 HoangThien: Can you learn VietNam language to speak with us :v
 JuliaPhan: OMG, poor HoangThien
 WINWINWIN: :D I can barely understand some of my own country languages :P
 TrungNB2404: ai Việt Nam ko
 [CG]Thibaud: kicked
 [CG]Thibaud: thanks WINWINWIN for the gentle message
 WINWINWIN: Welcome [CG]Thibaud
 Astrobytes: These guys are here most mornings
 Astrobytes: (Good morning btw&#160;:) )
 WINWINWIN: Good morning Astrobytes&#160;:)
 [CG]Thibaud: would you 2 like to have moderation rights here?
 Astrobytes: Well, might not be a bad idea, I'm logged in pretty much all the time while I'm not a sleep
 WINWINWIN: I dont think I would be able to tell when to use, so probably better to give more experienced people/
 geekpius: hi
 geekpius: am new here
 WINWINWIN: Hi geekpius
 PkZ: is there a proper way to fix found end of line expected Nothing in puzzles? my current method is writing an if if its the last element
 WINWINWIN: I think that you have a print() that prints nothing somewhere?
 Astrobytes: Or it could be another error elsewhere which results in nothing , hard to say without more information
 PkZ: I was printing a new line where it expected to end
 PkZ: I guess thats my bad
 Astrobytes: Don't worry, it happens&#160;:)
 [CG]Thibaud: it seems to me WINWINWIN that you handled well the case above, that's why I offered it
 WINWINWIN: Ok, let me try it&#160;:) but if you think that I am not doing properly please advise.
 Astrobytes: I agree WINWINWIN, diplomacy comes first&#160;;)
 WINWINWIN: Thanks Astrobytes&#160;:)
 [CG]Thibaud:&#160;:) I'll try to add more than 5 more moderators so we don't have the issues discussed on Discord two days ago. Would you recommend someone?
 WINWINWIN: If you decide to make me a mod, thanks for the opportunity [CG]Thibaud&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: euler still doesn't have mod rights on chat, only on discord, perhaps he might?
 [CG]Thibaud: oh right
 WINWINWIN: What about struct or jacek?
 Astrobytes: struct might do it, not sure if jacek would
 Astrobytes: But he might, worth an ask I guess
 Astrobytes: brb, afk 5 min
 [CG]Thibaud: kk
 WINWINWIN: [CG]Thibaud I just saw that adding a moderator willl require a reboot of chat. So when are you planning on adding mods?
 Astrobytes: back, sorry, phonecall
 [CG]Thibaud: when I have enough candidates
 Astrobytes: dbdr or robo maybe?
 dbdr: I apply&#160;:)
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: RoboStac?
 [CG]Thibaud:&#160;:+1:
 WINWINWIN: Will you post the list on discord once you decide?
 [CG]Thibaud: y
 WINWINWIN: ok, thanks
 dbdr: it's the Maiden's Feasts :D
 WINWINWIN: :D
 dbdr: you know the reference?
 WINWINWIN: Heard it in scchool sometime...
 WINWINWIN: something about killing the best guys?
 dbdr: I might not know that one :D
 dbdr: was thinking of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Age">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Age</a>
 WINWINWIN: I see :P
 inoryy: [CG]Thibaud while you're at it, it seems ru channel is missing a mod since MadKnight disappeared. Uljahn would be a good candidate imo
 Astrobytes: Uljahn for here too if he wants
 Astrobytes: good suggestion
 inoryy: I think he would get world mod along with ru anyway, right?
 dbdr: we need to organize a rescue mission for MadKnight too
 Astrobytes: I guess yeah, duh&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: He's become one with the pods dbdr
 dbdr: lol
 WINWINWIN: :D and if possible add a mod for #In? Some guy logged in and kept advertising some very clear schemes.
 [CG]Thibaud: y
 [CG]Thibaud: to Uljahn
 JBM: Mmmm, nice morning spam run
 JBM: Talking about Maddy, what are the news, beyond the "he vanished" part?
 Astrobytes: I think that's about it.Last couple of times I saw him online he was getting a bit tetchy about his association with CSB...
 Astrobytes: *'perceived' association with CSB
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-19">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-19</a>
 dbdr: dernier message il me semble
 dbdr: **MadKnight quits
 dbdr: sorry, last meesage I think
 Astrobytes: :flag_fr:
 dbdr: I fixed it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol so I see :DWow, so he actually did just quit then and there
 dbdr:&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: It seems peculiar that the Troll of Trolls would get lightly trolled into quitting
 dbdr: well, hard to know what went on
 Astrobytes: Can't imagine anybody just being nasty to Maddy
 JBM: Could be as simple as exam season followed by forgot to log back in, switched to some other interest without noticing
 JBM: Still, his absence is felt, and I worry
 Astrobytes: Nah Maddy would forget to log back in, and even during exam season he always popped in here and there
 Astrobytes: *wouldn't
 Astrobytes: Place isn't quite the same without him
 struct: hello
 struct: Astrobytes
 struct: "struct might do it, not sure if jacek would"
 Astrobytes: Hi struct, yeah Thibaud's looking for mods and WINWINWIN nominated you if you were interested
 JBM: So anyway, I wouldn't want to step into harassment/stalking territory, but a simple "he's alive and well" from anyone who'd know him more personally would be appreciated
 struct: JBM I can ask him in discord
 struct: I dont know Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: No pressure struct
 JBM: Is he still there?
 struct: He is online and playing a game
 JBM: Oh ok
 JBM: Well that's all I needed, thanks
 Astrobytes: He left us for gaming&#160;:(
 JBM: Who'd blame him?&#160;:-P
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 struct: I don't know him personally though, I played a few games with him, but not much besides taht
 DomiKo: omg
 DomiKo: i reach like 30K on second turn in UTTT
 DomiKo: and still cant beat MightyCarlo
 DomiKo: so sad&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Definitely sounds like a bug
 DomiKo: yea&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Debugging MCTS is always really fun
 DomiKo: i know
 DomiKo: 3 days now :joy:
 Astrobytes: lol, jeez :D
 DomiKo: from top150 gold now i reach like top40
 DomiKo: so iam going somewhere
 Astrobytes: Ah well, definite improvement then
 Astrobytes: I'm sure you'll find the issue soon enough
 Astrobytes: Probably a wrong sign or something suitably subtle and annoying
 DomiKo: yesterday i found bug with results of game
 DomiKo: like
 DomiKo: tie X X
 DomiKo: i sad that was X win 
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Easy mistake to make, at least you found it
 DomiKo: currently 21 gold and 78% winrate
 DomiKo: i feel really happy
 DomiKo: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: Keep doing what you're doing and you'll crack Legend soon enough
 Astrobytes: brb, afk 5 mins
 MSmits: found another bug in my oware sim lol
 MSmits: thats another thing a meta mcts will do for you, better sim-debugging
 Astrobytes: What was it this time?
 MSmits: it was a part of the weird thing i do to store the overflow on 31+ seed pits
 MSmits: it worked correctly for 11 pits, but my mask was not long enough for the 12th pit, so it ignored that one when it was overflowing
 Astrobytes: Oh right, that's error-prone at the best of times
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: That's actually why I didn't switch to bitboards for Oware
 MSmits: so the 12th pit overflowed into the 61th bit which meant it became empty. Then when i tried to look up the 15 seed end game database that 61th bit was still set, causing an error because the key wasnt in the database
 MSmits: you can imagine how fun that bug was to find
 Astrobytes: Nice! Very hard to spot that
 Astrobytes: Total nightmare
 MSmits: yeah, i had to track it down by having my bot write the entire last simulated game to a text file
 Astrobytes: And go through it by hand?
 MSmits: it was not that hard to find once i did that because the 61th bit makes the board code longer
 MSmits: it was the very last move
 Astrobytes: hahaha brilliant :D
 MSmits: but still not bug free on the meta mcts, backpropagating seed scores is also a nightmare
 MSmits: because captures happen within the selection phase and you need to factor that into backpropagating
 MSmits: lots of sign errors
 Astrobytes: That sounds like a candidate for one of the things I would least like to bother doing 
 MSmits: oh right, i dont backpropagate win/loss/draw
 MSmits: i backpropagate seedscores so i can use more transpositions
 DomiKo: wow i found bug!!!
 MSmits: grats&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: gg!
 DomiKo: did the same thing
 DomiKo: simulation to file
 DomiKo: not fun....
 Astrobytes: What was it?
 MSmits: well its much better than staring at the code for hours
 MSmits: trust me i tried that too :P
 DomiKo: i know :joy:
 DomiKo: one mask in checking result wast correct
 Astrobytes: Aha, well that would do it!Legend soon then?
 DomiKo: i wish

 jacek: ohai
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hey jacek
 Astrobytes: Hello
 MSmits: i noticed your succes on Onitama
 MSmits: did you make a new bot, or did you improve the eval?
 struct: Othello improved his skills
 MSmits: thats what I thought
 Astrobytes: jacekimax
 Astrobytes: Or whatever he called it
 MSmits: aww damnit, i cant get to top 2 in oware because they've been pushed too much&#160;:(
 MSmits: time for submit spam?
 Astrobytes: Be my guest
 jacek: tweaked eval as well
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits</a>
 MSmits: my last submit, bit weak vs robo (cg bench shows 47%
 MSmits: rest is over 50%
 MSmits: recurs e and agade have been pushed hard
 Astrobytes: Are those winrates consistent?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/963bf33f-a960-481d-a0ef-eaba2debdf83">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/963bf33f-a960-481d-a0ef-eaba2debdf83</a>
 MSmits: agade below 50% again, it fluctuates
 Astrobytes: More games might even it out. Seems OK in a live submit
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: this is without any book yet though, i think fixing those two sim bugs helped a bit
 MSmits: no more rare timeouts either
 Illedan: Damn, that is a lot of draws :o
 MSmits: vs agade yes
 Illedan: Is Oware solvable?
 Astrobytes: Nice. You're probably going to destroy everyone with that book
 MSmits: Illedan yes and no
 MSmits: awari is almost the same as oware abapa and solvable, but it resolves loops and oware abapa doesnt, so then it would be no
 MSmits: however, there is a 200 turn limit
 MSmits: so that would basically mean that it has 200x larger statespace at worst
 MSmits: probably a lot less
 MSmits: so yeah i think its solvable, but you'll need about 10-100 TB diskspace and a very smart memory strategy
 eulerscheZahl: it's a plan
 Washier: wow
 RoboStac: have you spotted I submitted a new version yesterday in your benchmarking?
 MSmits: ohh crap. no I havent
 Illedan: :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: you dont often resubmit
 RoboStac: shouldn't be too different, but has a bit more performance and fixes some bugs
 MSmits: for oware, not too different, means completely different
 Astrobytes: Something you found whilst working on Othello robo?
 RoboStac: well, it's the same nn in the background
 RoboStac: yeah, keep finding things
 MSmits: if i tweak one constant by 1%, my winrate against some player may go from 70% to 20%
 RoboStac: found some fairly serious bugs in my training, but I don't think they affect oware much
 MSmits: the thing is though, every time you retrain your NN, you get a different bot
 MSmits: that makes different decisions
 RoboStac: yeah, but I'm saying I've not retrained it
 MSmits: ohh ok
 RoboStac: that'll come when I get bored with othello
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 MSmits: sure
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile royale is playing checkers
 Astrobytes: Just to keep #1 :D
 MSmits: I'm gonna have to refit my bots params also, once i have a book I think. I think that currently, the optimal value of a param may be pivoting around one single early game decision or something
 eulerscheZahl: might be :D
 MSmits: its fun to see eulerscheZahl. So hey I heard you need a better uttt bot and a yavalath both to up your cp, do let me know&#160;:)
 MSmits: i can give some easy tips
 MSmits: just have to get past the "its not fun for me part"
 MSmits: I bet it would be more fun than botg
 eulerscheZahl: i hated BotG, so that's easy :P
 darkhorse64: Trying to get eulerscheZahl to the dark side of C# ....
 WINWINWIN: Lots of competition for the top spot&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i have some teapot code to study and improve my bots
 MSmits: I think i can help euler with those games even without getting him to c++
 MSmits: its not all about performance
 eulerscheZahl: it's also about clever scoring ideas
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: pruning and such
 MSmits: heuristics
 darkhorse64: Some teapot code&#160;? My vaults are not safe&#160;?
 MSmits: i would never share teapot code
 jacek: i should start reimplemeting pool node thingy for tree search. im still using the one i first create for my early attempts
 MSmits: but i use many of the same ideas as the teapot
 MSmits: hmm
 jacek: now that tree traversal became more expensive than my "rollouts"
 MSmits: are there many ways to implement a node pool?
 eulerscheZahl: but during the week i have little motivation to do more coding after my regular job
 eulerscheZahl: and i have a different weekend project for now
 MSmits: I get that euler, same here. I only code a lot now because of summer vacation
 Astrobytes: :spy:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more active during my vacation too
 eulerscheZahl: or back when i was still a student at university
 MSmits: I couldnt code back then =/
 jacek: computers didnt exists yet?
 eulerscheZahl: you are a student right now :P
 MSmits: oh right!
 Astrobytes: jacek bringing the insults :D
 MSmits: jacek not for me no, just as gaming machines&#160;:)
 MSmits: I do two classes coming schoolyear that are not about teaching 
 MSmits: Game design and functional programming
 MSmits: will be fun i think
 MSmits: i think for game design i get to fiddle with unity, which i already know somewhat
 eulerscheZahl: did 1 project with unity years ago
 MSmits: cool what was it?
 eulerscheZahl: reimplemented the game "SkyRoads"
 eulerscheZahl: was for a class about interactivity. so you were supposed to jump around to control the ship
 MSmits: ohh right
 Astrobytes: skyroads! Blast from the past
 eulerscheZahl: my part of the project was the game, got that working
 MSmits: someone else did the jumping?
 Astrobytes: :d
 eulerscheZahl: the one responsible for the jumping sucked
 eulerscheZahl: so you can only play it with the keyboard
 Astrobytes: Shame, that would've been fun
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: but i even found a wiki entry about the file format of the original levels
 eulerscheZahl: and managed to parse it and load them
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: cool
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have unity installed anymore. i wonder if i can still find the project code
 MSmits: if you didnt try to delete it it should be around somewhere
 MSmits: if you uninstall i dont think it removes projects
 MSmits: its gonna be hopelessly outdated of course
 MSmits: might need older versions of unity to run it
 eulerscheZahl: found some old code to use a USB-scope
 MSmits: huh
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1DfiEW6RV8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1DfiEW6RV8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: prof hated the software delivered with it, so he gave the task to write a new one
 eulerscheZahl: oscilloscope software
 MSmits: usb scope is to point at the screen and get coords, like with a mouse?
 Astrobytes: Pretty neat, I didn't know those existed
 MSmits: I shot ducks on Nintendo, same thing
 eulerscheZahl: you can measure analog signals like with oscilloscopes
 heavygabriel: can I do something like 8! in C#
 eulerscheZahl: and retrieve them via USB
 MSmits: oh, seems different
 MSmits: so no duck shooting with that
 Astrobytes: lol no
 Astrobytes: Would be handy in a classroom environment
 heavygabriel: also, how do you call the&#160;! in math
 heavygabriel: like when you do 8! it's 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
 Hjax: factorial? 
 heavygabriel: that's it!
 heavygabriel: thanks
 Astrobytes: You have to implement your own efficient factorial algorithm
 Astrobytes: afaik there's no builtin factorial method
 Astrobytes: Hi Hjax
 heavygabriel: I make my code "purposely" shit
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://zuse1.efi.fh-nuernberg.de:8050/interaktion/index.php5/SkyRoads">http://zuse1.efi.fh-nuernberg.de:8050/interaktion/index.php5/SkyRoads</a>found it, sorry for German
 Hjax: hi Astrobytes, othello seems to be becoming more active
 eulerscheZahl: code is linked at the bottom (Quellcode = source code)
 Hjax: i need to get my eval going lol 
 Astrobytes: Yeah! I'll hopefully have a new version soon too
 Hjax: ive just been lazy because i need to write a bunch of stuff before i see results 
 Astrobytes: Really wish you'd have been able to get the Kinect version working eulerscheZahl, that'd have been really cool
 Hjax: still havent written a local game runner
 Astrobytes: Nor I, laziness
 eulerscheZahl: also our prof insisting in using specific technology. e.g. OSC for process communication instead of doing all in unity
 MSmits: Hjax, if your bots have solvers, you dont need a local game runner
 Hjax: O_o
 eulerscheZahl: he wasn't even happy about our unity choice, wanted us to use the Blender game engine
 MSmits: you just trust it to have won when it says "WIN"
 Hjax: lol
 eulerscheZahl: which is deprecated now afaik :D
 MSmits: I did it, its a nice hack :P
 Hjax: if self.turn == 1: sys.stderr.write("WIN")
 MSmits: Blender over unity.... madness
 Astrobytes: lol, OSC as in Open Sound Control?
 MSmits: Hjax, you have to resist the urge to cheat against yourself :P
 eulerscheZahl: yes. you can send x,y,z over it too
 Astrobytes: Hm, never seen it used for that purpose before. Why not just in Unity tho? Just to learn something else?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and the final presentation was fun
 eulerscheZahl: other student played it with keyboard and got close to the end of the level
 eulerscheZahl: then just jumped over the target and failed. because we haven't implemented a "you win" situation
 eulerscheZahl: so to cover it up, we agreed to lose intentionally
 Astrobytes: lol, how deeply unsatisfying that would have been :D
 Astrobytes: Great strategy there
 eulerscheZahl: but his way of failing looked so completely retarded :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: should have hired a good actor
 MSmits: well this is probably going to be my class as well, something like this
 MSmits: hope I dont get paired with some bad jumping, crap acting loser
 heavygabriel: wait
 MSmits: for?
 Astrobytes: it
 eulerscheZahl: i hated group projects in university
 MSmits: same
 Washier: haha
 Astrobytes: same
 eulerscheZahl: hard to motivate the team to do anything
 MSmits: you suck as a cheerleader
 Washier: sure it was hard to keep up with the likes of you
 Astrobytes: Always getting lumped with the lazy ones
 heavygabriel: so since factorial of 8! is 8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1, is there something that is called for giving just the numbers instead of doing operations?
 MSmits: I give students group projects all the time
 MSmits: even though I hate them myself
 MSmits: does that make me evil?
 eulerscheZahl: in pari-gp you can type 8! directly
 Astrobytes: heavygabriel in C# you have to write it yourself
 eulerscheZahl: it makes you sadistic
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: good distinction
 heavygabriel: I'm talking about the math function
 Astrobytes: lol
 heavygabriel: not even programming
 eulerscheZahl: let's LINQ the factorial
 Washier: ouch
 eulerscheZahl: Enumerable.Range(1,8).Aggregate((a,b) =&gt; a*b)
 Astrobytes: Succinct
 Washier: i mean ouch when its code golf
 heavygabriel: nah because I just asked what factorial was to try and get the numbers that precede 8
 eulerscheZahl: make random teams MSmits. don't allow them to team up with their friends
 Washier: that is evil
 Hjax: i usually didnt have a lot of friends in my classes 
 Hjax: so i liked random teams :D 
 eulerscheZahl: same .D
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: In highschool there were certain people you wouldn't have put in the same team, or we'd get nothing done
 Washier: true, helped me too. but &gt;3d year you have your buds
 Astrobytes: I hate everyone by default anyway so uni was OK :P
 Washier: haha
 heavygabriel: MSmits wait what are you teaching in your classes?
 MSmits: physics mostly, but I am trying to get more into CS teaching
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl good idea, i know some colleagues do that
 eulerscheZahl: they LINQ their factorials? :o
 Washier: that's awesome. all technical education should have some CS in it me thinks
 heavygabriel: One thing that I've always thought that could be a good course or a lesson is the DHMO site
 Astrobytes: :D
 heavygabriel: thingy
 MSmits: no, the random team bit :P
 heavygabriel: makes you learn to fact check stuff
 heavygabriel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://dhmo.org/">http://dhmo.org/</a>
 MSmits: ohh a site with fake news about water?
 eulerscheZahl: a website about water?
 heavygabriel: no
 heavygabriel: it's not fake news
 heavygabriel: it's facts but like there's no context
 MSmits: alternative facts?
 heavygabriel: no
 heavygabriel: it's true facts
 heavygabriel: though
 eulerscheZahl: i vaguely remember
 MSmits: aha
 heavygabriel: "DHMO is a constituent of many known toxic substances, diseases and disease-causing agents, environmental hazards and can even be lethal to humans in quantities as small as a thimbleful."
 eulerscheZahl: a campaign to see how dump people behave with incomplete information
 heavygabriel: these things are all true
 heavygabriel: yeah
 heavygabriel: and I think it's important to show that to students
 Astrobytes: yeah, it's a classic
 heavygabriel: to make them think about what they see
 MSmits: it's cool
 MSmits: I could use this
 heavygabriel: to research and not take everything on face value
 heavygabriel: and I think this is an important lesson.
 MSmits: definitely
 Hjax: i saw someone did a survey on if we should ban the teaching of Arabic numerals in schools 
 heavygabriel: LOL
 Hjax: and a disturbing amount of people said yes 
 Astrobytes: loool
 heavygabriel: that's cringe
 Astrobytes: Dear oh dear
 eulerscheZahl: can we get rid of Latin letters as well?
 eulerscheZahl: Latin is dead
 heavygabriel: It's like the first thing you learn when searching numbers
 dbdr: perfect combo
 heavygabriel: wait is é cyrillic
 dbdr: can we still speak in morse then?
 heavygabriel: or something?
 Washier: jeepers. i get it now. deep
 heavygabriel: wtf it is latin?
 heavygabriel: how
 heavygabriel: and MSmits, what grades are you teaching physics to?
 eulerscheZahl: 16-18 year old students
 eulerscheZahl: and he's good at lip reading, which students don't always like
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: you wrote from the wrong alt
 heavygabriel: wait so he could basically be my teacher?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 dbdr: you were supposed to answer using your MSmits alt
 Astrobytes: And his real name is Walter White
 Hjax: i choose to believe smits look exactly like his profile picture 
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits isn't my alt. i'm Illedan
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: muddying the waters :D
 MSmits: lol
 heavygabriel: TBH at the start of the new class year I'm gonna talk to my teacher with the DHMO thingy
 heavygabriel: since she forgot
 heavygabriel: to do it
 MSmits: heavygabriel grades dont mean much internationally, but my students are 16-18 years old usually and at highests level of education we teach in our school
 MSmits: oh euler already answered
 MSmits: damn
 MSmits: i should read better
 heavygabriel: tbh I am international(IE outside of the US)
 heavygabriel: I am outside the US*
 Hjax: most people on this site are not from the US
 heavygabriel: so I get it
 MSmits: here international means outside France
 Hjax: france is probably the biggest country 
 heavygabriel: wow
 MSmits: CG is a French company
 heavygabriel: wait so that's why the french thingies are good
 MSmits: lots of sponsored contests for other French companies draw more players from France
 Legerocky: who is the kamdym dude. He seemed to follow everyone?
 Astrobytes: The French thingies? :D
 heavygabriel: I'm not from france but I'm outside the US
 heavygabriel: legit canadian
 MSmits: cool
 heavygabriel: french thingies= french translation/ words
 Astrobytes: ah
 MSmits: did anyone watch a lot of Pitch Meetings for movies on you tube?
 heavygabriel: also the DHMo thing
 MSmits: I did lately
 heavygabriel: it's in french
 Astrobytes: Ah Canadian eh, gotta grab the moose by the antlers eh MSmits
 MSmits: lol right
 Washier: haha
 heavygabriel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.dhmo.org/translations/french/">http://www.dhmo.org/translations/french/</a>
 heavygabriel: don't mock how I speak
 heavygabriel: eh is legit a substitude to what I say in french
 Astrobytes: No no, it was a reference to something in chat from a while back heavygabriel
 Astrobytes: And I use eh because I'm Scottish&#160;;)
 heavygabriel: I said that in a non-serious manner
 Washier: i'm not mocking. im south african, should here my accent, full of things like that
 MSmits: thats impossible 
 Astrobytes: And I also say "aboot"
 MSmits: you're Canadian
 Washier: haha
 heavygabriel: I USED IT IN A NON-SERIOUS MANNER
 MSmits: allright :P
 Washier: thanks eh
 Astrobytes: WE'RE NOT BEING SERIOUS EH
 heavygabriel: btw there's a region of Canada
 Hjax: i just have a boring general american accent 
 Astrobytes: :D
 heavygabriel: that is very old
 heavygabriel: legit 400 years old
 MSmits: i think they're all about 4.5 billion years old
 Astrobytes: Nova Scotia?
 Washier: haha
 heavygabriel: wait what?
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 heavygabriel: the first part that was inhabited by europeans
 Washier: Nova Scotia peeps have very oirish accent
 Astrobytes: Yes, lots of Scots and Irish went there in the early 1800s
 heavygabriel: btw can we talk about how newfoundland in english and french are totally different
 heavygabriel: like one is newfoundland
 Washier: they eat moose there? a lot of meat at least
 Astrobytes: I always wished the plural of moose was meese
 Astrobytes: And I cannot explain why
 Washier: how is newfoundland in French pronounced?
 heavygabriel: nvm newfoundland is the smae
 heavygabriel: toirre nove
 Washier: wow
 heavygabriel: it's butchered
 Washier: that's also not being serious i hope
 heavygabriel: but it's like the best pronounciation that I can get with like english words
 heavygabriel: it's not really pronounced like that but it does sound similar(a bit)
 Astrobytes: Terre Neuve you mean?
 heavygabriel: yes
 heavygabriel: pronounced
 Washier: Oh ok, new found land.
 heavygabriel: I thought you meant pronounciation
 MSmits: its got to be the least imaginative name
 heavygabriel: not the word
 Washier: French is really hard
 Washier: Its descriptive
 heavygabriel: all languages are hard
 MSmits: not all equally hard
 FLQ4: ok
 FLQ4: hi 
 MSmits: some languages have more exceptions to rules
 FLQ4: does anyone want to start a private match 
 MSmits: the languages with the most exceptions to rules are the hardest
 heavygabriel: ok all languages that are based from latin are generally equally hard
 FLQ4: ok
 FLQ4: but when you talk a lot in one language it becomes easy 
 heavygabriel: that's why you immerse yaself
 MSmits: Dutch has more exceptions than any other language. You can learn to speak it somewhat, fairly quickly. But it takes years not to sound like an idiot
 heavygabriel: use french subtitles
 Washier: i speak Afrikaans and English, i can read Dutch no problem, bit harder is German but the rest is very hard.
 heavygabriel: and try to understand it
 heavygabriel: idk
 heavygabriel: what I did to learn english was to go online
 heavygabriel: and read stuff
 heavygabriel: in like 2 years I learned it
 Washier: TV taught me English
 MSmits: subtitled tv taught me the basics
 heavygabriel: roblox taught me the basics
 Washier: Icelandic is hard
 eulerscheZahl: my English teacher taught me English
 MSmits: I never learned much in English class
 heavygabriel: yeah because you aren't immersed in english
 MSmits: I was
 Washier: Everyone can(should) speak C
 MSmits: I was always playing RPGs with lots of text
 eulerscheZahl: i definitely improved after school. movies, reading documentations, ...
 heavygabriel: nah but I mean in the general sense of the word
 MSmits: English
 DomiKo: #Washier Polish is hard 
 FLQ4: i think japanese is the haredet
 Washier: Can imagine Polish is hard
 heavygabriel: like the thing with almost all languages are if you don't have a good translator person/someone to ask questions on the language, it becomes really hard
 Astrobytes: I guess which languages are difficult for you to learn depend on what your native language is
 Washier: damn, I was wrong. Icelandic might be easier for me
 MSmits: thats true Astrobytes
 Washier: very
 MSmits: but there is a more objective way to look at the difficulty of languages\
 heavygabriel: so that's why spanish is like "oh so it's french but different"
 MSmits: and thats their structures, the number of rules you have to learn, the number of words and the number of exceptions to rules
 Washier: NLP
 Astrobytes: Fair
 MSmits: children with no language at all will be fluent in some languages at 6
 MSmits: and others only at 8
 MSmits: Dutch is bad like that
 Washier: How so?
 MSmits: tons of exceptions
 MSmits: you need to know for each word whether it is female or male, past tense differs for different words and such
 Washier: for me they make sense, my mother tongue is derived from Dutch
 heavygabriel: so like a bit french?
 MSmits: yeah, but worse I think
 Washier: then again, we did away with a lot of those rules
 MSmits: saw a talk about this where a lot of languages were compared
 Astrobytes: Whereas English is so easy that I was reading Shakespeare in utero :P
 MSmits: Washier good idea
 heavygabriel: I think I learned  english at like 10-11
 Washier: our language is about 100 years old though, so more hip&#160;;)
 MSmits: sounds weird to a Dutch person though
 Astrobytes: Afrikaans is a mix of how many languages Washier? It came about through mining iirc?
 Washier: Its 90% Dutch, 5% German, 4% English, 1% French if i have to guess
 Astrobytes: It's a pretty cool language, I like how it sounds
 Washier: I have  long time Dutch penpall. We write in our own langs and understand all of it
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: yeah
 Washier: Its guttural, and expressive. 
 MSmits: i have problems understanding it when its spoken though
 MSmits: but reading it is easy
 Washier: Like our rugby&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: hahaa :D
 MSmits: Washier did you guys have a lot of protests like many countries do?
 Washier: I think about the usuall amount
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: We had a few, but nothing like in the US
 Washier: Its spreading late, so holding thumbs
 Hjax: i used to wish i lived in the city 
 Hjax: but this year im glad i dont 
 Astrobytes: Back when I was cheffing, my last head chef was SA, I acquired a love for biltong, bobotie and boerewors
 MSmits: which one?
 Washier: Yes, we didn't have any race related stuff really.
 heavygabriel: english is like "what if we made a language that cannot differenciate between you plural and singular, has the majority of verbs conjugate the same way etc."
 Washier: Boerewors would be my last meal. 
 Hjax: me MSmits?
 heavygabriel: like you cannot differenciate between you(as in you all) and you
 MSmits: yeah i just realized you meant any city :P
 Astrobytes: I'm a veggie these days but that was a damn good sausage
 Hjax: im like 2 hours from both Boston and NYC
 heavygabriel: you have to rely on language
 MSmits: NY is a good place to be corona-wise though
 Washier: true
 MSmits: the rest of the country is screwed
 Washier: Or New-Zealand
 Hjax: the north east has everything under control now 
 Hjax: meanwhile florida has gone off the deep end 
 Washier: Florida is worrying
 heavygabriel: I am 8  hours away
 heavygabriel: or 600 km
 Astrobytes: They lifted lockdown real ealry right?
 heavygabriel: away from boston
 Astrobytes: *early
 MSmits: a civilized country where people are refused medical care because no room
 MSmits: GJ
 Hjax: not just that, a lot of people in the south dont believe in the coronavirus, they think its some kind of hoax 
 Hjax: and therefore dont wear masks 
 heavygabriel: and 8 hours away from ny
 Washier: freedom apparantly
 Hjax: and dont do any social distancing 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's very worrying 
 Washier: as if the rest of the world is not free.
 MSmits: Italy had an excuse for this because there were more unknowns, the US has no excuse
 Washier: Italy was overwhelmed quickly yes
 MSmits: Spain too
 Washier: And they have an aging population
 Hjax: its politics that are inhibiting our response, the USA is more than capable of dealing with this 
 Washier: Same yes
 Astrobytes: 100% Hjax
 MSmits: physically capable yes
 Washier: 100%
 Hjax: we have the infrastructure and technology to support dealing with this, but if the people dont cooperate its pointless 
 Washier: You taking classes online now i hope
 Hjax: me? oh im not in school anymore
 Hjax: graduated a couple years ago 
 MSmits: seems like my oware meta mcts doesnt have obvious bugs anymore
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/dW1l53Q">https://imgur.com/a/dW1l53Q</a>
 Washier: oh good
 MSmits: at least it expects move 5 is the best move after not many visits and expected seed count around 0 which is a draw
 Hjax: which is another way of saying "my meta mcts only has subtle bugs that i will be cursing at later"
 Astrobytes: Just subtle ones now MSmits
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol 
 Hjax: beat you to it Astrobytes :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: its such a hard to "see" game, I have no idea whether its suggesting good moves
 MSmits:  I guess i just need to run it for a while and see if my bot gets better
 Astrobytes: Yeah, without manually playing out positions it's hard to gauge just by looking
 Astrobytes: Go collect some stones and some egg cartons 
 MSmits: lol
 struct: javascript is something special
 Washier: is it better to work hard on one board game, or start as many as you can. I'm asking because oware sounds cool
 MSmits: I work on very few
 MSmits: because i like to dive deep into them
 MSmits: but others play everything
 MSmits: just do what is fun
 Washier: ok ty
 Astrobytes: Up to you really, doesn't take long to get up and running but in terms of focus only you can know that
 Astrobytes: yeah, what Smits said&#160;:)
 Washier: do you guys build frameworks, or take it one game at a time
 Washier: guessing the answer is try both
 MSmits: hmm I reuse a lot of code
 Astrobytes: Definitely reuse lots of code
 MSmits: the details change and the sim is always completely diffeent
 MSmits: but mcts functions can be copied
 MSmits: just gotta be careful about sign errors and such
 Washier: ok ty
 MSmits: in some games you're always player 1 (like in oware), or at least the board is sent to you as if you are p1
 Astrobytes: And a general framework for you're bot with reading, error printing and stuff is handy
 MSmits: and other games give you a player id
 Astrobytes: *your bot
 Hjax: i dont think ive reused any code between any of my bots 
 MSmits: you will at some point
 Hjax: granted i now have bots in 3 different languages 
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Washier: i also like to take it on one at a time. one thing i need to do though, i think, is brush up my C. 
 Washier: and ditch the #
 MSmits: why not just do c++
 MSmits: get classes
 Hjax: or join team rust and prevent people from testing against you :P 
 Hjax: (they really ought to fix that) 
 Washier: i've always liked C\C++ for the C stuff - the ++ part i dont like. might as well go # then
 Washier: but thats just me.
 MSmits: Hjax from what  I understand it cant be fixed
 MSmits: its inherent to Rust
 Washier: Rust does look cool though
 RoboStac: they can do release mode everywhere at the cost of having worse stack traces on crashes
 Hjax: even if it was a flag that i could put at the top of the file 
 MSmits: ah right... but thats not really developer friendly
 Hjax: to force release mode 
 Hjax: that would be fine 
 Washier: isn't C# in the IDE also in debug mode?
 Hjax: yep
 tomatoes: actually same stack traces :slight_smile:
 Washier: figures
 Hjax: having it be a flag we put in our code would be kind of a hack, but its better than nothing 
 MSmits: Washier C# you can use a trick to disable it
 MSmits: not sure how it works, but you restart the main function without the flag i think
 tomatoes: there was a poll in discord about release in ide for rust, so should be changed someday
 MSmits: oh
 Hjax: debug rust is roughly the speed of python, which is kind of amusing 
 MSmits: wow so slow
 RoboStac: yeah, its a lovely mix of no optimisations and really expensive runtime checks
 Hjax: yeah i get 7000 rollouts first move in othello in debug 
 Astrobytes: lol, good debug info though right?
 Hjax: instead of the 500k i get normally 
 struct: this is how D tested vs rust
 Hjax: would it be that hard for them to check if the source file contains some substring, and compile release if it does? 
 Hjax: the runtime debug checks are useful, it catches stuff like an integer underflow and throws a panic 
 Washier: MSmits, will check that out
 Washier: 500k! holy smokes.
 Hjax: they are depth 6 early terminated rollouts 
 Hjax: not full rollouts 
 Hjax: my bot prints the number of rollouts each turn as it plays 
 Hjax: usually its about 500k for turn 1, and 60k for other turns 
 Washier: cool thanks
 Washier: Look, personally I'm very grateful for the ability to code in just about any lang - i come from kaggle where its python or bust
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Washier: so a few quirks is forgivvable
 Washier: *are forgivable. 
 Washier: awesome community too
 Washier: hugs all around peeps&#160;;)
 Washier: socially distant hugs that is
 Astrobytes: Yeah it's a good community&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *great
 eulerscheZahl: and a big community during contests
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah
 Washier: yes. wish i was there for the pod racing one
 Washier: what a game
 eulerscheZahl: that was before my time too
 Astrobytes: Same
 Hjax: the first contest that held my attention was utg
 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic here
 eulerscheZahl: in october 2016
 Hjax: but ooc and pacman werent as fun
 Hjax: so i have high hopes for the fall contest 
 Astrobytes: This time, the whole contest will be hidden and you'll have to find it
 eulerscheZahl: your first was platinum rift, Hjax
 Washier: i thought ooc was great. but still learning
 Hjax: it didnt hold my attention though 
 Hjax: i spent like an hour on it 
 eulerscheZahl: and left CG for years after that experience
 Washier: I am partial to 2-player perfect info game must say
 Hjax: i technically also played legends of code and magic 
 Hjax: but also only spent an hour or two on it 
 eulerscheZahl: both games are not in my top10
 Washier: most good players i see did well with the pods
 Washier: (high ranking)
 Hjax: my csb bot is just the bare minimum to get most of the points 
 Hjax: that game isnt very interesting to me 
 Astrobytes: The physics-based games are definitely Marmite games
 Hjax:&#160;?
 DomiKo: in csb you can get like 4K points with 3 lines
 Hjax: yeah its depressing isnt it 
 DomiKo: yes it is
 Astrobytes: Marmite, yeast-based spread that has the slogan "Love it or hate it" (Vegemite, same thing)
 Hjax: ah 
 DomiKo: its depressing as top5 in gold in UTTT  :(((
 Astrobytes: You're top 5 now?
 DomiKo: was second
 Hjax: how is top 5 gold in uttt depressing? because is just vanilla mcts?
 Astrobytes: Almost there! How many points below boss?
 DomiKo: a lot
 DomiKo: i can get like 80% winrate with boss
 DomiKo: but 20% with the second guy
 DomiKo: or 20, 50
 Astrobytes: Well, you're in a much better place now since earlier at least&#160;;)
 DomiKo: i cant beat them both
 DomiKo: yea
 Hjax: you could pull the boss below the second guy 
 DomiKo: now i don't know if i have any more bugs or not xD
 Hjax: promote the second guy to legend 
 Hjax: and then promote yourself :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah, keep spam-submitting lol
 DomiKo: that would be awesome
 DomiKo: boss is really strong
 DomiKo: have 2 point lead
 tomatoes: did you try lower c constant?
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: using standard 2
 DomiKo: i reach like top10
 DomiKo: i use like 0.8 i i reach top3
 DomiKo: but that really weird
 DomiKo: sometime i reach 40K on second move
 DomiKo: and still lose to boss
 Hjax: what constant are you using for othello tomatoes? still sqrt 2?
 tomatoes: 2 without sqrt
 Hjax: interesting 
 Hjax: thats stronger than sqrt2?
 tomatoes: handcrafted :sweat_smile:
 tomatoes: im not sure how to bench two versions
 tomatoes: almost no random
 Astrobytes: yeah, I ended up at 1 for my  oware EPT after a lot of testing
 dbdr: you can add artificial variability to do benching tomatoes
 tomatoes: random move with some probability?
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: or not random but your second best
 MSmits: the exploration parameter depends fully on the range of your node values
 MSmits: if you score between 0 and 1 the param will be twice as small as when you score between -1 and 1
 Washier: go Hjax
 Hjax: i score between 0 and 1 
 MSmits: then your param will be small
 Hjax: i just submitted a smaller constant to see what happens 
 MSmits: also, you can add a constant to all your node values and have the same bot
 Hjax: 1 instead of sqrt 2 
 Washier: cool
 MSmits: say, all your scores are between 14 anf 15
 MSmits: -1 and 1 is most convenient imho
 MSmits: because of sign symmetry between players
 MSmits: 0 for draws
 Hjax: right now my EPT treats all scores below 0 as a loss, and all scores above 0 as a win 
 Hjax: i feel like its probably better to turn them into win&#160;% rather than binary win / loss
 DomiKo: Hjax you asked about vanila mcts? 
 Hjax: have you tried the teccles heuristic 
 DomiKo: dont know what it is
 Hjax: play the move that forces your opponent to play in the same miniboard you are playing in 
 Washier: is mcts generally more popular than minimax\alpa-beta
 Hjax: it depends on the game @Washier
 MSmits: but only do it when the board is empty
 Washier: i mean on codingame
 MSmits: teccles i mean
 Washier: ty
 MSmits: DomiKo watch any game my bot plays on the leaderboard when i am p1
 MSmits: you will see teccles
 DomiKo: hmmm interesting
 Washier: teccles?
 Hjax: teccles is a player on this site, havent seen him for a while 
 Hjax: but he came up with the idea 
 DomiKo: ohhh
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476259596">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476259596</a>
 Washier: wow, quite specific.
 MSmits: check where all the crosses land
 MSmits: then you'll understand it
 DomiKo: i see MSmits
 MSmits: it's not always the best move
 DomiKo: so i i could do such move
 MSmits: but it early game it certainly seems to be
 DomiKo: should i always do it?
 MSmits: i always do it
 MSmits: but
 MSmits: i know examples where it costs me the game
 DomiKo: in like first 20 moves?
 MSmits: that would be safer yes
 DomiKo: or someting
 MSmits: i never changed it to that, but its probably better
 DomiKo: i will try it
 MSmits: in late game some boards are toxic, you dont want to play on them because playing on them forces you to give the opponent a free move
 Washier: so @MSmits, you study the particular game deeply.
 Washier:&#160;?
 MSmits: so if you are able to play on an empty board, it might be better to send your opponent to such a toxic board
 MSmits: i studied uttt a lot yeah
 Washier: ty
 MSmits: mostly by staring at meta mcts
 DomiKo: meta mcts is like full mcts?
 Hjax: meta mcts is mcts with the rollout replaced by a mcts program playing the game 
 MSmits: its a mcts where the rollout phase is a bot playing an entire game, with full calculation time for each turn
 Hjax: its used for book building 
 MSmits: so a single rollout can be 1-3 seconds
 Washier: mind blown. must eat dinner. have a good day\evening
 MSmits: have a good dinner
 MSmits: btw meta mcts is not just useful for book building. You can also discover good heuristics and such
 tomatoes: there is some pdf's about meta-mcts
 MSmits: teccles heuristic becomes pretty obvious with a meta mcts
 MSmits: yeah i know tomatoes
 MSmits: I mostly figured out my own way of doing it, not sure if its what they do
 MSmits: theres a lot of little details to deal with also, like symmetry and transpositions
 MSmits: thats not easy to combine with mcts 
 struct: omfg
 MSmits:&#160;!
 Astrobytes: :o
 MSmits: :scream_cat:
 Astrobytes: :scream:
 MSmits: would be funny if that was the last thing he ever said on here
 MSmits: we'd be wondering forever
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: I'm guessing this is JS related struct
 DomiKo: i have question to teccles
 DomiKo: should i do that move with random propability?
 MSmits: why
 DomiKo: idk
 DomiKo: i always make it
 DomiKo: and its getting worst...
 MSmits: you can use this heuristic in 3 possible ways afaik
 struct: Yes Astrobytes
 DomiKo: hmmm
 struct: This is a pain to debug
 MSmits: 1) just make the move instead of searching
 struct: I dont think im supposed to do this in javascript
 MSmits: 2) On expansion of a node, only consider this move  so that your node will have 1 child
 MSmits: 3) On random rollout also only consider this move when simulating
 MSmits: try and see what works
 jacek: i do the move, but search so i have something for tree reuse
 MSmits: i think i do 1 and 2
 MSmits: not sure about 3
 MSmits: i just reset the tree 
 MSmits: if the opponent doesnt do it
 MSmits: so i reset the tree alot
 tomatoes: didnt your rollouts count was higher? 
 MSmits: whose rollout count?
 tomatoes: domiko
 DomiKo: submited without pragma....
 MSmits: lol
 DomiKo: lmao
 MSmits: classic mistake
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 DomiKo: thanks tomatoes
 DomiKo: 12K insted of 30K ....
 MSmits: I like to paste my bot into the wrong language setting and submit without looking and lose every game :P
 DomiKo: :joy:
 MahdiSLM: its fucking hard
 MahdiSLM: :D
 MSmits: what is
 jacek: thats what she said
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MahdiSLM: my brain blows out
 MahdiSLM: what the fcking hell
 Astrobytes: Might wanna see a doctor about that :P
 MahdiSLM: yes sure
 MahdiSLM: but i dont think that doctors can cure programmers
 MahdiSLM:&#160;:|
 DomiKo: double win with boss
 DomiKo: maybe that's it
 struct: im losing my mind
 MSmits: that's lucky
 MSmits: if you're still in the process, you know where it is, after you've lost it you're in trouble
 MSmits: you never hear anyone say: "I'm losing my keys"
 MSmits: that would be stupid
 DomiKo: actually you're right
 WINWINWIN: :D
 dbdr: it's a bit different because your mind is part of the "you" who is losing it
 dbdr: my keys are losing themselves&#160;;)
 Hjax: mind losing is gradual, key losing is sudden
 no39mz: hello some one want to talk 
 Unstoppablefart: I just came from codecademy and thought I knew everything
 Unstoppablefart: now my brain is fucked
 DomiKo: i know what you feel bro xD
 WINWINWIN: Important, dont trust the other stuff circulating

 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 jacek: :v
 WINWINWIN: What does :v mean?
 Astrobytes: It's jacek's actual face
 Astrobytes: (I have no idea)
 WINWINWIN: :P
 jacek: i like pacman face
 Astrobytes: ahhh
 WINWINWIN: Nice&#160;:)
 FLQ4: hi
 FLQ4: lol
 FLQ4: tychkorg is good 
 WINWINWIN: Hi FLQ4
 FLQ4: hi
 WINWINWIN: tychkorg is a bot&#160;:)
 FLQ4:&#160;?
 FLQ4: is that why he alwats gets in my game
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, he joins games with a low number of people
 WINWINWIN: which happens pretty often.
 FLQ4: ok
 Astrobytes: Check this article FLQ4, look for the "Codingame Official Bots" part:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/</a>

 Astrobytes: no problem&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: you're welcome
 jacek: hey NN addicts, do you use bias in bots?
 RoboStac: yes
 jacek: does it really makes difference?
 RoboStac: I've not tried without - as far as I'm aware removing it is more common on large networks
 RoboStac: but I'm probably not the best person to ask about it as I'm in no way a NN specialist 
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: Is anybody here?
 jacek: good evening, Sir/Madam
 Astrobytes: ask inoryy jacek
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: Hello! Could you, please, help me. I found really call solution for one of tasks, after that close it, and now can not find "brilliant" solutions. What should I do if I want to find it again?
 Astrobytes: Clash or puzzle?
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: I only 15 minutes here... What the "KIRK'S QUEST" is?
 Astrobytes: Hm, where did you find your solution?
 jacek: the descent?
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: You're quite right!
 Astrobytes: Kirk's Quest was the old name for it no?
 Astrobytes: Oh it still shows it on the viewer
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: Sorry, Astrobytes! I submit my solution and after that cite suggest me to watch the best ones
 Astrobytes: TwilightBeast_e7f0 Do you know how to find them?
 tomatoes: left panel - results - browse other solutions?
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: It's the question&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yes, what tomatoes said is how you will find them
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: Tomatoes, thank you so much!
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: As much, as any others! My gratitude
 Astrobytes: Any time you solve a puzzle you can always check other solutions but only in the language you solved in btw
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: No spoilers?)\
 Astrobytes: There are Hints for some of the easy puzzles but no solutions until you finish )
 TwilightBeast_e7f0: Oh, thank you!
 jacek: ok, learning my MLP seems to be working. in oware 4-ply vs 4-ply i get 73% winrate. dunno how it scales. too bad its 20x slower for now
 Astrobytes: 'MLP'
 Astrobytes: gj tho
 jacek: maybe friendship really is magic
 Astrobytes: :scream_cat:
 jacek: :racehorse:
 Zenoscave: dbdr I got some questions about your ProbCut
 Astrobytes: The answer is "No. Go away. Please no more probcut" :P
 Zenoscave: Shame
 Zenoscave: ok
 Astrobytes: lol, just kidding
 Astrobytes: He's using it brilliantly huh
 Zenoscave: Yeah and I have no idea how to LR on the params
 Zenoscave: linear regression
 Astrobytes: I got it, biologist remember :P
 Zenoscave: YESSS
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Offline games I believe, but i'm not aware of the specifics.
 Astrobytes: multiple LR
 Zenoscave: That's what I figured inverse phi function has what domain?
 Zenoscave: do you know if dbd r uses MPC or regular probcut
 Astrobytes: Oh it's confusing to me too, I'm still trying to wrap my head around all of it never mind getting it working
 Astrobytes: He definitely uses MPC
 jacek: no MLP?
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 Zenoscave: what's mlp?
 Astrobytes: Ponies. That.
 jacek: i was thinking multilayer perceptrons, i think dbd doesnt use those.
 Astrobytes: jacek's favourite acronym swap
 eulerscheZahl: only 26h till caturday
 Astrobytes: oh yeah, I thought it was Wednesday today&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: This working at home *all* the time gets to you
 eulerscheZahl: btw did you get your blood test results?
 Astrobytes: Since I've just realised they were due today, no
 eulerscheZahl: on tuesday i was wondering if it's monday
 Astrobytes: I need to call for a doctor early, then call for my results after 2pm tomorrow
 Astrobytes: *call for a callback from a doctor
 eulerscheZahl: sounds complicated
 Astrobytes: Not really, they just have limited staff atm and still shit to walk-in 'trade'
 Zenoscave: I think I have the MPC figured out.
 Astrobytes: omg shut not that
 jacek: oo
 Zenoscave: Just need to figure out how to do LR in c
 Astrobytes: Care to share? I kept getting lost as to what applied to what
 Zenoscave: sure
 Zenoscave: I'll use different symbols as there's are inconsistent and confusing.
 Astrobytes: I noticed that
 eulerscheZahl: either you mean theirs or i don't get the sentence at all
 Astrobytes: yes euler
 Zenoscave: I am American we don't understand grammar very well here
 Zenoscave: very good&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: well i think
 Astrobytes: very well
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Grammar in the US is your Grandpa's wife
 Zenoscave: Given a current turn (Stage), Large ply count (D) and a smaller ply count (D_prime) we want to make a model that says how well your score at d_prime models a score at d
 Zenoscave: for just that turn
 eulerscheZahl: i failed some grammar exams too back in school
 Zenoscave: I didn't have any exams for it. Hooray public school system
 eulerscheZahl: and then the teacher gave us the exact same exercise again to see if we learned and tried to understand
 Y0ursTruly: lol someone named lelouch
 Y0ursTruly: oh wrong chat sry huys
 eulerscheZahl: that's the story of how I got 2 F's within 2 weeks
 Zenoscave: I almost didn't graduate highschool. 
 eulerscheZahl: what was your nemesis?
 Zenoscave: Papers
 Zenoscave: anything that wasn't a computer or math problem
 eulerscheZahl: you failed paper plane class?
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Zenoscave: actually no, my aeronautical engineering class I excelled at
 MSmits: should have asked to use stone tablets imho
 jacek: he failed paper soccer exam
 Zenoscave: but paper covers rock MSmits
 MSmits: true
 MSmits: i stand corrected
 eulerscheZahl: the paper is mightier than the sword
 Zenoscave: did you not pay attention to pacman shifumi?
 Astrobytes: scissors cut paper, probably -&gt; probcut
 Zenoscave: exactly
 Zenoscave: astro I'll send my MPC main function estimator to you if you wanna look over the main flow
 Zenoscave: won't include any implementation... but it might clear some confusion
 Astrobytes: thank you that would be helpful
 Zenoscave: Ok imma write it real quick
 struct: So many acronyms
 struct: mpc? multi probcut?
 Astrobytes: yup
 Y0ursTruly: whoooh that was srs, i was third with 33 chars of code
 MSmits: woulda won with 35
 Y0ursTruly: first got 19, second 26
 struct: 19 chars?
 struct: what was the problem?
 Y0ursTruly: it was to find all the sum
 Y0ursTruly: of all even numbers
 MSmits: oh so you just output infinite
 Y0ursTruly: and the even numbers are counted by a single number
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Y0ursTruly: no boii
 Astrobytes: *the sum
 Y0ursTruly: like if the input is 4, u add 2,4,6,8
 Y0ursTruly: but all 3 of us found the lifehack instantly
 Astrobytes: *of the given input
 jacek: isnt there fancy math formula for that?
 Y0ursTruly: n*(n+1)
 struct: so n*~-n
 Y0ursTruly: and i didnt know, i just saw it
 struct: even shorter
 Y0ursTruly: im no math prodigy
 Y0ursTruly: never heard the formula in my life
 Y0ursTruly: ohhh im in another clash o dang gtg
 MSmits: hf
 jacek: Y0ursTruly dont let anything distract you
 MSmits: yeah focus on those 33 chars while I try to find a bug among my 20,000
 Astrobytes: Why is it when people come across solutions to things they don't know, they just go 'wow, awesome' and copy paste it later or whatever but crucially - never actually even try to understand?
 MSmits: saves time
 Astrobytes: I value knowledge higher than clash times
 struct: 19 seems the shorter I can get&#160;:(
 MSmits: they don't
 Astrobytes: It's madness
 struct: p (n=`dd`.to_i)*-~n
 MSmits: just do /flip
 MSmits: its prettier than the one you just made
 Astrobytes: Yep, that looks horrid
 MSmits: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 struct: print n=input * (n -1)
 struct: n+1*
 Astrobytes: ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)
 Astrobytes: nice-r
 struct: Now Im stuck on trying to shorting it
 struct: ......
 MSmits: at least you're not losing your mind anymore
 MSmits: progress
 Y0ursTruly: it is some kinda horrible questions they asking nowadays
 Y0ursTruly: a spell checker
 Y0ursTruly: and it is in the shortest code option
 Y0ursTruly: i doubt i cud make a spell check in 15 mins anyway
 MSmits: wait, do you think the questions need to be spellchecked?
 MSmits: cuz i can get behind that
 Y0ursTruly: I am not a good speller. Sometimes I mix up the spelling of words and sometimes I even forget to put periods. Please count the number of words I have misspelled and the number of periods I have missed.
 Y0ursTruly: GOAL
 Y0ursTruly: ...
 Y0ursTruly: Two space separated numbers, first the number of misspelled words (words that differ from the problem statement), secondly the number of missing periods.
 Y0ursTruly: OUTPUT GOAL
 Y0ursTruly: ...
 Y0ursTruly: I am not a gud spiler. Sumtimes I micks up teh spiling of wurds and sumetimes I even forgett to poot pariods Pleas cout the numbr of wurds i have mispilled and the numbr of pariods I have missed.
 Y0ursTruly: example input
 Y0ursTruly: ...
 Y0ursTruly: simple hack time
 Y0ursTruly: not actual hack btw, life hack
 Y0ursTruly: put the one thing that is constant and leave
 MSmits: I have no idea what you're talking about
 Y0ursTruly: ooh lol
 Astrobytes: He posted the problem
 MSmits: if you're missing periods you need to do a pregnancy test
 Y0ursTruly: xD
 Astrobytes: "full stops"
 Astrobytes: This is not a difficult thing to solve btw
 Y0ursTruly: not just full stops
 Y0ursTruly: incorrectly spelt words
 Y0ursTruly: that is spellchecking 100
 Astrobytes: Yes I know, I was just translating "periods" to "full stops"
 Y0ursTruly: 0_0
 Y0ursTruly: why is something like that allowed!?
 Astrobytes: Something like what?
 Y0ursTruly: no way someone cud do a spellcheck program from scratch in 15 minutes
 DiL: hi everyone! is it normal sometimes chat "fails to connect to server" and reloads?
 Astrobytes: There's a bunch of approaches, heard of sets?
 Astrobytes: DiL yes
 Hjax: if you had a dictionary already, spell checking is really easy 
 Hjax: its just edit distance 
 Hjax: its like a few lines of code 
 Astrobytes: Hjax it's just difference between two sets
 Astrobytes: yeag
 Hjax: sets? 
 Y0ursTruly: except ur code is uploaded to server for evaluation
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Y0ursTruly: how u so sure they have ur dictonary to work with
 Y0ursTruly: *dictionary
 Hjax: maybe you read it through io at the beginning 
 Hjax: still easy 
 Y0ursTruly: hmmmmm
 Y0ursTruly: not with what they give us
 DiL: oh ok! this is the reason I disable it: when it reloads focus moves to chat... while I'm typing code in IDE
 Astrobytes: I mean you get the full normal text, then the misspelled text, and you have to output number of misspelled words and missing periods
 DiL:&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: DiL yeah ?disableChat doesn't survive the reload unfortunately
 Astrobytes: Ohh wait, I see what you mean. Yes
 MSmits: since they update the IDE, my multis load really slow
 MSmits: i should turn it off
 DiL: just out of curiosity: is it possible to contribute to the development of this website?
 MSmits: can we turn the IDE into a place where you dump text and nothing else?
 Astrobytes: DiL you can suggest things in forum or discord
 DiL: I mean by writing code&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: No
 MSmits: actually
 MSmits: you can create puzzles, clashes, multis etc.
 MSmits: contests even
 Astrobytes: Well yeah, that, but not the actual site
 MSmits: so yeah you can code to create content
 DiL: ok! thanks Astrobytes and MSmits
 Astrobytes: you're welcome
 DiL: I'm not that good in writing clashes... yet at least! hope in the future&#160;:-)
 MSmits: even better, improve the ones that are already up
 MSmits: some are bad
 MSmits: i think if you've done enough clashes, you can change them, but not sure
 Astrobytes: Well, take a look at some of the better contributions that you see, and the more nejoyable/better clashes you play, and use them as a base
 Astrobytes: *enjoyable
 MSmits: but in my opinion clashes are the least interesting part of CG
 Astrobytes: Same for me, but lots of people love them
 DiL: yep MSmits... some clashes have "bad" tests cases... I found a couple where I could not pass test but I score 100% o_O
 MSmits: seems so
 MSmits: fix those when you can DiL&#160;:)
 MSmits: I once fixed a puzzle
 MSmits: its pretty easy
 Astrobytes: Oh The Ant was fixed btw MSmits
 MSmits: awesome!
 MSmits: thats not the one I meant, but thats cool
 Astrobytes: Thibaud posted it somewhere in the forum
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know but it reminded me
 Astrobytes: Came across it the other day
 MSmits: I thought it was cool I found the bug in the referee which is half-written in French
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db8e59ef-694c-4d5a-934d-0996e124cac1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/db8e59ef-694c-4d5a-934d-0996e124cac1</a>
 Zenoscave: Astro there.
 Zenoscave: MAX_HEIGHT should be MAX_DEPTH
 Zenoscave: at the end you just load the param set into your MPC and use it with the ProbCut code from buro
 DiL: clashes are like cherries: "just one more, then I'll get back to work"... too addictive&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Gotcha Zenoscave, thanks a lot man, that's a lot clearer!
 Zenoscave: It took me forever to read that paper. It's awfully written
 Zenoscave: Np Astro&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Cool, not just me then! So many crappily written papers about useful algos, the MCTS solver one springs to mind...
 Zenoscave: there's a couple bugs in the source and the implementations are up to you but that should help
 Zenoscave: Oh yeah it definitely is a trend
 Hjax: that LOA mcts solver paper causes me pain 
 Hjax: i was so confused by it 
 Humble.Proletarian: your mother is a lovely woman
 Astrobytes: Yeah that's fine, it was just relating the whole thing was giving me a brainache, that's very helpful
 Zenoscave: Let me know what you think of the code too!
 Zenoscave: I gotta write the linreg function but then I'm good to go!
 Astrobytes: Yeah Hjax, I and others questioned my sanity after the pseudocode in that paper
 Zenoscave: One thing I couldn't figure out is how to deal with early termination games. so linreg may have bad data on some trials at late stages
 Zenoscave: but that's a code issue not an algo one.
 Astrobytes: Absolutely. Code-wise, I hate snake case :P I see you used some stuff from the chessprogramming page, this is a lot clearer now.
 Astrobytes: I'll study it properly tomorrow, getting late for me here + painkillers so I don't dare touch any code
 AhmedMasry: Hello
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm out for tonight. Many thanks again Zenoscave. Gn all
 iSPANKzombiez: hello friends
 DomiKo: hi
 iSPANKzombiez: how does the do?
 DomiKo: trying to beat UTTT gold boss
 iSPANKzombiez: oof. im still in practice...
 DomiKo: right now iam at 84% and still number one
 iSPANKzombiez: can't figure out the temperatures
 DomiKo: first time before boss 
 iSPANKzombiez: noice
 DomiKo: trying 4 days...
 DomiKo: need help?
 iSPANKzombiez: yes please....
 DomiKo: which task?
 iSPANKzombiez: how does one iterate over the temps provided?
 iSPANKzombiez: "temperatures" in pracetice
 iSPANKzombiez: practice**
 DomiKo: you can use sample code
 iSPANKzombiez: i can't find the sample here...
 iSPANKzombiez: the last couple had a "hints" tab
 iSPANKzombiez: i cannot find one here
 DomiKo: in IDE
 DomiKo: you can refresh code
 DomiKo: in top right corner
 DomiKo: it should read data
 Uljahn: lol
 DomiKo: and do sth like
 DomiKo: print('result'
 DomiKo: omggggg
 iSPANKzombiez: yea it pulls up the numbers. but i have to compare them to eachother.
 DomiKo: at 99%
 DomiKo: boss beat me...
 Uljahn: DomiKo: i see you have around 20k rollouts on the second turn, should be enough
 DomiKo: 99% man
 Uljahn: but that 0.01
 Uljahn: crazy
 DomiKo: submit spam
 DomiKo: lets go
 Uljahn: gl
 DomiKo: one submit = 20 min
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pasteboard.co/JgVhnCQ.png">https://pasteboard.co/JgVhnCQ.png</a>
 DomiKo: look at this man
 iSPANKzombiez: me?
 DomiKo: only with star lord had &lt; 50% winrate
 DomiKo: how i lose....
 iSPANKzombiez: ok not me
 DomiKo: hmm
 DomiKo: you need to compare
 DomiKo: thats right
 DomiKo: what language you use?
 iSPANKzombiez: java
 iSPANKzombiez: javascript **
 DomiKo: xd
 iSPANKzombiez: should i use something else?
 DomiKo: nahhh
 iSPANKzombiez: i'm using this because i play hack mud. figure this would help
 DomiKo: you can you whatever you want
 iSPANKzombiez: so how do i go over the list and compare?
 DomiKo: i checked sample code
 DomiKo: and it reat to const t
 DomiKo: yea?
 iSPANKzombiez: yea
 DomiKo: i guess you have to use abs
 iSPANKzombiez: AbstractRange?
 DomiKo: absolute value
 DomiKo: abs(-5) = 5
 Uljahn: you could use two variables for negative and positive values closest to zero
 iSPANKzombiez: ok... but what im confused about is how i "read over the list" once the list is made
 iSPANKzombiez: like how do i do something like...
 iSPANKzombiez: var firstnum = 50
 Uljahn: that's quite a newbish question i guess
 iSPANKzombiez: if (firstnum &gt; newnumber) {
 iSPANKzombiez: var first num == newnumber
 iSPANKzombiez: im sorry this is all new to me
 iSPANKzombiez: 0 exp except for what i've done on Hack Mud
 iSPANKzombiez: (which isn't much)
 DomiKo: i guess
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard">https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard</a>
 DomiKo: that site would be better
 DomiKo: you can learn
 DomiKo: in small steps
 DomiKo: here
 Uljahn: on CG you can use debug output to examine your inputs and intermediate values
 DomiKo: omg
 DomiKo: i done it
 DomiKo: i got legend UTTT!!!!!
 DomiKo: omg its 3:26.....

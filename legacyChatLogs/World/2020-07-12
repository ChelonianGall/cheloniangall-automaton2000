 ArhanMisra: me too
 thanhhv317: where are u from?
 U.N.Owen: He's from california
 thanhhv317: why are you know it?
 ArhanMisra: ummm who are you
 U.N.Owen: he's my fried
 thanhhv317: yeah
 U.N.Owen: *friend
 thanhhv317: do you want play code game with me
 U.N.Owen: We are, I got first in the same one as u
 U.N.Owen: He still hasn't finished
 thanhhv317: okay&#160;!!
 U.N.Owen: Now he has
 thanhhv317: how old are u
 U.N.Owen: 13
 thanhhv317: wow
 U.N.Owen: lol
 thanhhv317: what is language code
 U.N.Owen:&#160;?
 thanhhv317: nono
 thanhhv317:&#160;:)
 U.N.Owen: oh, python
 thanhhv317: js
 U.N.Owen: nice
 thanhhv317: i am student
 thanhhv317: and i want to a job
 U.N.Owen: i am too, and i do too
 thanhhv317: i can build a website with php,html,css,js
 thanhhv317: you can do it?
 U.N.Owen: nice
 U.N.Owen: i typically use django, cause it's easier for me to code in python
 thanhhv317: wow
 thanhhv317: i think python fit for algothym, AI
 U.N.Owen: Yeah, i use it on ai too, but with django it's simple to make websites
 thanhhv317: with web, python not power
 U.N.Owen: True
 U.N.Owen: But I don't have much practice with js
 U.N.Owen: I'm learning though
 thanhhv317: good
 thanhhv317: but
 thanhhv317: 13 year old&#160;?
 U.N.Owen: yup
 U.N.Owen: u?
 thanhhv317: 16
 U.N.Owen: cool
 thanhhv317: u very cool
 thanhhv317: i am bad
 U.N.Owen: nah
 U.N.Owen: Ur prbly better than me
 thanhhv317: do u want play a game with me
 thanhhv317: solo code :xd
 U.N.Owen: Aren't we in the same one rn?
 U.N.Owen: Oh, what is the solo code thing
 U.N.Owen: We couldn't find it
 saarques: Hey everyone!&#160;:)
 U.N.Owen: Hey
 U.N.Owen: I wonder why we're using the world chat
 U.N.Owen: isn't there one for only our game?
 saarques: Glad to be a part of this community!, thanks for your amazing support
 saarques: Don't know, Seems like there is
 U.N.Owen: um... ur welcome?
 saarques: Coc####
 U.N.Owen: yeah, right
 U.N.Owen: I sent a message on it
 saarques: Indidrect support, I was literaaly craving to start coding for a while
 U.N.Owen: oh, lol, coding's a great world
 U.N.Owen: I've been doing it since I was about 6
 saarques: Yu it is.
 saarques: I couldn't do it this much, I am in my final year lol
 U.N.Owen: college or high school?
 saarques: And that too CSE
 saarques: College
 U.N.Owen: cool
 saarques:&#160;:)
 U.N.Owen: I'm in middle school, i have nothing but time
 saarques: Cool
 saarques: Getting itno new COC, wanna join?
 U.N.Owen: yeah, one sec, I'm messing with my friend
 saarques: Sure thing
 U.N.Owen: he and i are the last ones on this and I'm lying about my character count to make him submit
 saarques: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 U.N.Owen: lol, i'm in
 saarques: Yup
 U.N.Owen: nice one
 saarques: Aaaaa
 saarques: You got it
 U.N.Owen: only cause i cut the spaces
 saarques: Yup
 U.N.Owen: apart from that, u and i did the exact same thing
 Andriamanitra: did you even need end=""&#160;?
 saarques: I have this habit of putting spaces
 saarques: Yup, it was needed
 U.N.Owen: lol, its a good havit
 saarques: Yeah, it makes things clear for me, when I'm doing some big nasty work
 U.N.Owen: u needed the end="" because otherwise u would've had a new line at the end, but I guess it wouldn't have mattered much to them
 U.N.Owen: Yeah
 U.N.Owen: Cleaner code is better code
 saarques: No, it did matter
 U.N.Owen: Oh
 U.N.Owen: Yeah
 saarques: I tried that, it wasn't accepting the newline
 Andriamanitra: weird, i had newline at the end of my square
 saarques: That's cool too Andriamanitra
 U.N.Owen: urs would be fine, because the default value of end is a newline char
 U.N.Owen: But we wrote it in one print statement
 saarques: No, your may not have been a newline, I in my case, put it forcefully
 saarques: Yup, just as owen said
 U.N.Owen: so, we had to add our own newlines and then there would be excess at the end
 U.N.Owen: Oh, owen isn't my name, its just a username thing
 U.N.Owen: I use it in a lot of places, its from a book
 saarques: Ohkay&#160;:)
 U.N.Owen: It's supposed to be sounded out as Unknown, ya know
 U.N.Owen: Un Owen
 saarques: I remember only one Owen, that's a footballer
 saarques:&#160;:)
 U.N.Owen: lolll
 saarques: Ohh, right
 U.N.Owen: It's from agatha christie's "And then there were none"
 saarques: Hmm, that's cool
 saarques: Up for the next one? :upside_down:
 U.N.Owen: yup
 U.N.Owen: One sec though, i have to wait for my friend
 saarques: Sure
 U.N.Owen: no, he did it in the same time as me
 saarques: forky is your friend, it seems
 U.N.Owen: k, I can join the next one now
 U.N.Owen: hm, no, its ArhanMisra
 saarques: Ohh, okay
 U.N.Owen: Oh, I think I missed urs
 jistjoalal: i just did a clash that only required 3 buttons on keyboard
 saarques: That's great
 Andriamanitra: why am i getting security checks every single time i join a clash T_T
 kazuki_fuze: ok lets go
 jacek: because youre bot
 Kyojin_MasterX: funny

 ViktorCalebFuentes: oi
 ViktorCalebFuentes: hello
 ViktorCalebFuentes: fuck you
 DomiKo: another top1 in gold ehhh
 DomiKo: that's the feeling when you love it and hate it at the same time
 jacek: but youre in legend now?
 jacek: also, go to wybory
 dbdr: gg on joining the top pack, MSmits!
 jacek: :F
 DomiKo: wybory done&#160;;)
 DomiKo: and no&#160;;( 
 MSmits: thanks dbdr, I just have a few eval parameters, super basic
 MSmits: trying to tune them but half of my opponents cant be tested against
 MSmits: also there's some serious rock paper scissors, already found a set of parameters that beats tric trac half the time
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's very annoying not being able to test
 Astrobytes: gj btw&#160;;)
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: I think a simple set of params like  i use in oware is going to be really limited here
 MSmits: I do think one of those fancy trained evals is necessary
 Astrobytes: Seems like the way to go
 MSmits: I'll see if I can make something work after I get back from vacation
 MSmits: never done this before
 jacek: trained eval?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: like the ntuples
 Astrobytes: How is the election going jacek
 MSmits: jacek running for office?
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: for codingame president
 jacek: im gonna ban rust
 MSmits: ahh I see
 MSmits: good idea
 MSmits: those damn rusties, coming in and stealing our leaderboard spots
 dbdr: easier than to compete?&#160;;)
 JBM: definitely
 JBM: just claim it's unfair for some reason and get them banned
 JBM: like why do they get -O2
 MSmits: they'd choke otherwise?
 Astrobytes: ffs :D
 dbdr: C/C++ gets #pragma. ban them!&#160;:)
 JBM: ban them all
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/669/">https://xkcd.com/669/</a>
 Andriamanitra: in clash of code is there no way to see where my code went from after the round? i was a bit too quick on the old submit button
 dbdr: CG should only accept OISC code. how to generate it is up to players
 JBM: (as it is for any code)
 jacek: oisc?
 MSmits: Othello submit is like: Wreck anyone rank 8 and below, then get wrecked by anyone 1-4 while trying to catch a tomatoe
 MSmits: gap below tomatoes is huge
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer</a>
 dbdr: i like the "catch a tomatoe" expression :D
 MSmits: thanks :copyright:
 dbdr: wow, you just caught a tomatoe :D
 MSmits: seems like it yeah
 MSmits: i am just messing with parameters
 MSmits: that frontier stuff is useless btw
 MSmits: in an eval
 MSmits: took it out, best param value was 0
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it helps in one stage of the problem and not in another?
 MSmits: i have the corners thing and also tried to add a separate eval for corner adjacents
 MSmits: could be eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: could not make corner adjacents work yet either. Maybe I need to check whether the corner has been taken already
 MSmits: if the corner is taken, then its no problem to have a corner adjacent cell
 jacek: thats why ntuple would take care of
 MSmits: otherwise when you own a corner, you'll get punished for also having a corner adjacent
 MSmits: yeah i know
 dbdr: tomato is still fresh after all
 MSmits: yeah, rock paper scissors
 jacek: no, tomato is already rusted
 jacek: and rotten
 tomatoes: :smile:
 MSmits: hi
 tomatoes: i think frontiers is a bit usefull in the early game
 tomatoes: first 20 plies maybe
 MSmits: maybe, couldn't tell
 MSmits: this is really the perfect game to experiment with. I get why it's so popular as a research subject
 MSmits: damnit jacek, 9 wins in a row to start my submit. You just had to ruin it
 jacek: :cat:
 MSmits: trying to get past tomatoes, renard and tric trac
 MSmits: otherwise known as
 MSmits: fox and friends
 MSmits: oo first jacek win
 jacek: :E
 struct: Damn even with no books
 struct: The game was played perfectly for 10 turns
 struct: until MSmits made a mistake
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476763887">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476763887</a>
 struct: The right move was D7
 jacek: how do you know
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.orbanova.com/nbook/">http://www.orbanova.com/nbook/</a>
 SkyDreamer: just did a shortest code contest and i cant understand why my code didnt work
 SkyDreamer: print('+'.join(sorted([int(i)for i in input().split('+')])))
 MSmits: well this is definitely a good submit then
 Astrobytes: It would certainly appear so, very nice
 MSmits: I love that this game has a public opening book
 MSmits: if i ever make one for othello i can check it against that
 jacek: or jsut copy paste
 MSmits: whats the fun in that
 MSmits: I hope people do that
 MSmits: it's so easy to counter a deep opening book&#160;:)
 jacek: there is logistello database games, for which you can train from
 jacek: or compare
 MSmits: yeah hjax is going to do that
 jacek: you pushed me above robo, thx
 MSmits: you're welcome
 MSmits: my current test:
 MSmits:             RoboStac    GW=25,00%    [ W=16,67%   L=66,67%   D=16,67%  ] [18]
 MSmits: doing well against renard and trick trac
 MSmits: but Robo is strong
 jacek: youre not testing against me?
 MSmits: not yet, you're too tough, waste of games
 jacek: i feel so unworthy
 MSmits: if you lose everything, then there is no test
 MSmits: I try to pick opponents around my bots strength
 MSmits: in this case, many are rust, so not much to choose from
 FLQ4: lol
 dbdr: only tomatoes
 FLQ4: only oranges
 MSmits: and hjax, and that one guy at the top, forgot his name
 jacek: but he uploads the binary&#160;:?
 MSmits: oh dbdr is testable
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you'll just lose
 MSmits: not that it matters. I am not going to play 2000 games to see whether I win 1 or 2
 struct: high expectations I see
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: and hij*x is quite lower, so test probably not useful either
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: had the same problem in oware, tests against robo and re curse were useless for a long time
 MSmits: true
 dbdr: so improving my bot would be a good investment
 MSmits: if I dont find a fancy eval like the top 3 did, I will not come anywhere near I think
 MSmits: unless I cheese it and counterbook your bot, but I only do that when I am already in the ballpark, otherwise it feels like cheating
 dbdr: and should be easy to counter if needed
 MSmits: not exactly
 MSmits: unless you randomize your bot
 dbdr: book against your book
 MSmits: so far I won every book war. It's a matter of who is most obsessed
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: i can hold on because I think its fun to do :P
 dbdr: sounds fun to me too&#160;:)
 MSmits: well we'll have one later then maybe. But I need a good bot first
 MSmits: btw, i try to counter book robo in oware atm
 MSmits: not having much luck at all
 MSmits: he plays perfectly deterministic
 MSmits: but
 MSmits: so far first 15 plies he plays perfectly. He doesnt seem to make a mistake :P
 MSmits: so kinda hard to counter. Expected seed difference stays at 0 and I lose the rest of the game 
 jacek: and yet here i am weith the move 10 as p2
 MSmits: oh right, seems to work fine jacek
 MSmits: my tests say 1, 4 and 5 are good as p2
 jacek: so you cant outbook me!
 MSmits: Robo does 1, I do 5, Agade as well
 MSmits: It takes forever,  iwont get to you with in a month probably, if it even works
 MSmits: maybe my bot is not good enough to create a reliable oware book. It's a long game
 jacek: when i search deep, there is 5 vs 4, sometimes 1
 MSmits: I saw a paper that listed games of top bots
 jacek: and robo resubmited
 MSmits: they started with F a lot (6th pit)
 MSmits: yeah I know I am testing vs his current bot
 MSmits: i meant they replied with F a lot sorry
 MSmits: so 5
 jacek: i use 6-11 for the upper ~
 MSmits: I think multiple replies are solved as a draw
 MSmits: ah I just always use 0 to 5
 MSmits: from what i can tell only  the 0 reply (6) is bad
 MSmits: maybe 2 also
 jacek: i wonder if in ancient times they researched that game thoroughly
 MSmits: maybe it would explain some cave drawings :P
 Astrobytes: That was during the Owarecene era
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 PAVANBHAT: hi
 jacek: good morning
 MSmits: when Robo's bot says -100 he lost?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476766964">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476766964</a>
 MSmits: I am just wondering how a NN can solve this soon
 eulerscheZahl: An error occurred (#UNAUTHORIZED): "You are not authorised to view replay 476766964".
 MSmits: ahh right
 MSmits: i forgot about that
 jacek:&#160;?
 MSmits: i cant share a cg bench game
 struct: if you do share-replay in the link MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: you can
 struct: will it work?
 MSmits: how?
 eulerscheZahl: click the share button
 MSmits: the share button isn there
 jacek: na sharing
 jacek: no caring
 eulerscheZahl: screenshot or i don't believe you
 struct: If he edits the link to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476766964">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476766964</a>
 struct: and then opens it
 struct: wont it share it?
 Astrobytes: Button? For cg-bench?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/ZtdKA2j">https://imgur.com/a/ZtdKA2j</a>
 eulerscheZahl: hmmm...
 MSmits: you dont need the link though, I was just referring to the -100 he says one ply after I solved it on my side
 MSmits: so I am guessing he solved his loss
 dbdr: that does not look very soon
 MSmits: but NN's dont search very deep
 MSmits: 16 plies before the end though
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even care about the -100, just wanted to nag you
 MSmits: i know :P
 dbdr: very few legal moves
 dbdr: tree is narrow
 MSmits: true
 dbdr: why does NN not search very deep
 dbdr: eval is more expensive?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I think they have 10x less rollouts or something
 MSmits: maybe even less than that
 dbdr: must depend a lot on the network
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: i guess good eval also does help you solve a bit sooner
 dbdr: say it's linear in the number of weights
 MSmits: might have been a fluke
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476767557">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/476767557</a>
 MSmits: here i solve pretty late, but he solves much later even
 MSmits: perhaps because he doesnt do his eval when there's just 1 child
 struct: dbdr you have no opening book right?
 dbdr: none
 dbdr: yet&#160;;)
 struct: Your bot early moves are optimal, even when oponent makes a mistake
 struct: amazing
 MSmits: i think some training methods might  basically encode an opening book within the weights. Early game positions occur much more often than middle game ones, so if you just train on games, you may train harder on the opening
 dbdr: well, since I have no book, it makes no different what the opponent does
 RoboStac: MSmits - yeah, -100 is I know I've lost
 MSmits: ahh ok thought so
 RoboStac: the policy from the nn means I search good moves effieciently
 dbdr: right
 struct: Yeah dbdr but what I was trying to say is that you answer the wrong move with the perfect move
 RoboStac: despite only eval'ing about 3000 positions per turn
 MSmits: yeah that makes sense
 MSmits: I eval 650k positions :P
 dbdr: it means ntest has book entries for opponent "mistakes"?
 struct: yeah
 dbdr: interesting
 struct: you can try the link I posted
 dbdr: might not need it if it's a big mistake
 dbdr: but they have different constraints
 dbdr: space is not an issue
 struct: even if opponent makes a mistake
 struct: you can do a worse mistake after
 RoboStac: was hoping for better from this submit, hadn't spotted tric had updated and msmits was now an issue&#160;:(
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: well you put some distance between me and the fox so thats good
 dbdr: true in principle, struct, but othello is short enough and close to draw, that one mistake is probably fatal, if you have a good enough search
 MSmits: oware is even worse like that
 MSmits: well its not short, but it has crazy loops
 MSmits: 1 mistake does lead to loss
 struct: Cant be worse than Yavalath
 MSmits: hmm, its different
 MSmits: yavalath is harder to solve probably
 MSmits: but it has early game ends
 MSmits: many
 RARH: hi im kinda new to coding
 MSmits: welcome
 RARH: my dad keeps making me do things like this even though he knows i struggle like crazy with them
 MSmits: your dad is making you code?
 RARH: yh
 MSmits: modern of him
 MSmits: he coulda been making you practice baseball or something cliché like that
 RARH: i do sort of like coding but not when its waaaaay too hard
 MSmits: small steps
 Astrobytes: *we have rounders and cricket here MSmits
 Astrobytes: No baseball.
 RARH: lol
 MSmits: ow
 MSmits: RARH do easy puzzles here
 MSmits: the easiest ones should be doable
 MSmits: you can pick what language you think is easiest
 MSmits: small steps
 RARH: is that meant to be a link?
 MSmits: oh you mean the red color?
 MSmits: thats what you see when someone types your name
 RARH: it wont work like one if i hover my mouse over it (yh the red)

 RARH: i think
 MSmits: JBM euler is in a mood where he annoys people
 eulerscheZahl: yes you did RARH
 MSmits: you know how that is
 eulerscheZahl: why do I annoy people?
 JBM: i dunno
 JBM: but you shouldn't
 MSmits: you said you were nagging me earlier :P
 eulerscheZahl: you shared an invalid link
 MSmits: thats true
 Astrobytes: trollerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: and i still need an artist
 RARH: it doesnt look like i have the profile pic thing on my screen...
 eulerscheZahl: that's MK style, Astrobytes

 Zenoscave: Oh man I almost had a SSD bite the bullet
 Zenoscave: just about lost a lot of private git repos I don't have backed up.
 inoryy: aren't private git repos free now on github?
 Zenoscave: Not sure
 struct: they are
 Zenoscave: should probably check
 jacek: yes, but github belongs to m$, so
 struct: up to N members I think
 Zenoscave: Yes!!!! Good news everybody
 Zenoscave: where's hypnotoad
 eulerscheZahl: private repos are free for up to 3 collaborators
 inoryy: jacek so..?
 jacek: i dont trust them :v
 eulerscheZahl: not everything MS does is bad
 inoryy: are you hanging onto outdated stereotypes?
 eulerscheZahl: .net core is under MIT license
 jacek: outdated?
 inoryy: alright, what is your distrust based on
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't install a windows on my personal computer. too much ways to collect your data and i don't like the OS itself
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't hate MS as a whole company
 jacek: i have windows only for the games
 eulerscheZahl: only windows + MS office
 Astrobytes: Apple kinda out-MS'd MS tbh
 jacek: but i dont like windows 10 nagging and forces updates
 eulerscheZahl: i only play old games that run with wine
 jacek: better games are played with vodka
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: as for the elections, welp exit polls: 50.4% vs 49.6%
 Astrobytes: To Duda?
 inoryy: if you're studying in university I wonder if you're even old enough to remember why MS was hated for in the first place; peake of their cutt-throat and anti-consumer practices was almost 20 years ago
 jacek: yes, but we need to wait for vote counting
 Astrobytes:&#160;:/ best of luck
 eulerscheZahl: back in those days when Linux was considered the enemy
 MSmits: it's not anymore?
 Astrobytes: Ah the antitrust case days, it almost doesn't feel like that long ago until I remember my age
 eulerscheZahl: they even integrated a linux shell in windows
 inoryy: point is that it's under a completely different leadership, arguably a different company basically. 
 Astrobytes: Very different.
 digitalmaster: pretty close
 Astrobytes: Anyway, it's Google everyone needs to worry about now eh inoryy :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

 MSmits: your solver has a bug i think
 jacek: well for oware i treat draw as lose
 MSmits: why?
 trictrac: yes thank you draw is bad managed
 MSmits: kk np
 jacek: copied from old code mcts, too lazy to change into draw
 MSmits: lol ok
 MSmits: is this  normal or do i have a bug:

 struct: you did not find loss?
 MSmits: ahh no, it must be a bug
 jacek: tomato did win with me like that or with dbd
 tomatoes: both :sunglasses:
 jacek: turn on legal moves
 jacek: you get many legal moves, and trapot has many frontiers
 MSmits: hmm ok
 jacek: if your eval account for that, it will say its very good
 MSmits: i dont do frontiers
 MSmits: ohh I see
 MSmits: I dont end the game properly I think
 jacek: maybe your solver didnt kick in to ruin the fun
 MSmits: yeah something like that
 MSmits: i wonder if this is only my new version or that it also happened in the old
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=193189&amp;curpostid=193190">https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=193189&amp;curpostid=193190</a>
 zombi3123: Is anyone else terrible at codinggame or just me?I'm rubbish and getting quite worried. Am I just dumb or what? I've just started my internship is this a sign I'll be useless and get sacked or what?
 zombi3123: Need advice here
 Schwase: m8 thats pretty hard for any of us to weigh in on. but id say if its an internship leading to employment, you should measure your success based on the tasks they give you, if its work study itd be awfully hard to lose the position without some form of rule breaking
 Schwase: dont let CG be the standard you use to measure if youll be good at your internship, just let it be a measure if youre good at what skills CG requires/tests
 Andriamanitra: none of us really know what we're doing, just keep grinding and checking stackoverflow for every stupid little thing
 struct: What stuff are you doing zombi3123?
 struct: puzzles?
 zombi3123: I'm doing clash
 zombi3123: Just abit worried is all
 Schwase: there there
 Schwase:&#160;:)
 zombi3123: What about the euler problems. I find they take me about an hour or longer to do each
 zombi3123: and I don't think I can do many on the next pages
 Schwase: some people could never get through them tho you have a leg up on all of those people
 zombi3123: Not really clear on that
 zombi3123: Oh yeah true
 zombi3123: Some people find things difficult I find easy
 Schwase: like math
 zombi3123: Did haskell coursework in uni and some people couldn't do question 1 where as I did nearly every question
 zombi3123: Without uch difficulty
 zombi3123: *much
 Schwase: youll do fine
 Schwase: just dont be lazy
 Schwase: and show them what you know they want to see
 Schwase: are you good socially? like do people (professionally) like you usually?
 zombi3123: I'm alright. i think I have aspergers syndrome which makes me abit socially weird, but nothing major people like me
 Schwase: ok, so thats good
 zombi3123: Usually when I'm stressed out I act more normal than in my calm state
 zombi3123: I'm more normal in work than school/college
 Schwase: performing under pressure is a good trait
 struct: I recommend puzzles over clash
 struct: no time pressure
 Schwase: ^
 zombi3123: not so much that lol. I just mean my personality is less weird when under pressure ahaha
 Uljahn: agreed, clashes are like 10% of experience CG can deliver
 zombi3123: I have anxiety which is anoother thing
 Schwase: yeah you wont ever need to speed code for most work
 Schwase: just take your time and get through your assignments without letting things go for too long and you should be ok
 Uljahn: in multis you can test your ability to handle larger projects
 Schwase: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Zombie, Spock and the Large Hadron Collider
 Schwase: :P
 zombi3123: goin to bed now. Night xx
 Schwase: good night
 Schwase: dont stress about it too much
 Schwase: at the end of the day, we have control only over the present and never over the future itself

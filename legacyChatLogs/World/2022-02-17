 therealbeef: lol 46 million rollouts per second
 antiwonto: [automated] Hey therealbeef, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 11 tacos
 abt8601: Cries in 0.15 million rollouts per second
 therealbeef: oh, it was in the last turn, so not much to simulate nor many tree expansions (mcts)
 abt8601: Well that makes sense
 CKGussin: Is the discord for this dead? It doesn't seem to get much engagement
 abt8601: My UTTT bot does 15k rollouts in the 2nd turn (100ms)
 Wontonimo: those are rookie numbers!
 therealbeef: ah this is connect4
 therealbeef: in first turn I get only 1.9 million per sec
 Wontonimo: jk abt8601, that's actually really good
 abt8601: :joy:
 Wontonimo: how did you get into legend with 15k though?  I thought the boss was 20k
 Wontonimo: are you using mcts solver?
 Momotron23: hry
 struct: If the rollout is smart you dont need as many
 Wontonimo: ah, that's smart
 struct: therealbeef have you tried to avx some stuff?
 struct: 1.9M is still very good
 abt8601: Let me check my changelogs real quick
 therealbeef: yes this is my first avx'ed version of rollout. might still be optimized a bit more
 struct: you avx the rollout?
 therealbeef: yes
 struct: so 4 games at once?
 therealbeef: indeed
 struct: Or something else?
 Wontonimo: NICE!  x4 the data
 abt8601: So you wrote the intrinsics yourself?
 therealbeef: actually it cant be fully vectorized, and there is overhead, so I got almost 2x increase
 struct: I never tried to avx the rollout
 therealbeef: me neither, but connect4 has such clean bitboard logic so i wanted to try
 struct: So you have 1.9M * 4
 therealbeef: no, 1.9M is with counting +4 for each rollout
 struct: ah ok
 struct: abt8601 I just use immintrin header
 struct: and then write the code using the methods there
 therealbeef: bit worried though; because rollouts x2 with vectorization of 4 means I have only half the tree expansions
 therealbeef: gained 10 rank, so it works, but worried that i'm getting more statistics but less penetration of the tree
 Uljahn: guess your exploration/exploitation coefficient is fine-tunned already
 struct: yeah you probably will solve a bit later
 struct: aswell
 struct: also is your rollout fully random?
 therealbeef: Uljahn nope
 therealbeef: i've just been blindly optimization the speed. no solver, no tweaking, start every turn with empty tree, etc
 therealbeef: yes, random rollout, no pruning
 struct: I cant remember how much of an improvement for me a smarter random rollout was on c4
 struct: because my first submit was already a smart rollout
 therealbeef: i'm guessing mcts solver adds a lot?
 Wontonimo: nope
 therealbeef: because there's many dead-ends on connect4
 Wontonimo: nott much at all really
 Wontonimo: oh, i tthought you meant code
 Wontonimo: but it makes your bot a lot stronger
 therealbeef: yes strength&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: yeah, very much so.  like killer
 struct: between smart rollout and mcts its hard to pick
 struct: mcts solver*
 struct: But I dont test these things
 therealbeef: having both a solver and smart rollouts makes sense?
 darkhorse64: Yes
 Wontonimo: why not?
 struct: Why I dont test?
 Wontonimo: i don't think there is any reason you can't have both therealbeef
 Wontonimo: no struct.  i was asking therealbeef why not have both?
 struct: ah ok
 therealbeef: hmm, yeah was silly question actually&#160;;-)
 struct: on bt it was a huge boost to have a smart rollout
 therealbeef: because they work on separate parts of the algorithm (selection and rollout)
 struct: the smart rollout on c4 will increase your rollout turn duration
 struct: so you will get less rollouts at the end
 struct: but it will be a bit more accurate
 therealbeef: might be hard to combine smart rollout with simd though
 struct: yeah, one of the reasons I never tried to simd rollout
 struct: because my fuctions to get winningcells is simd
 struct: basicly it checks all 4 directions at once
 Wontonimo: i used smart rollout on springchallenge2021 + MC.  Got to gold :grin:
 Wontonimo: i mean legend
 Wontonimo: Whats MC?
 antiwonto: [automated] 'mc' was defined as ' Monte Carlo. Like MCTS except no tree. Much easier to implement but not as powerful ' by Wontonimo
 Alshock: btw how do you tune your exploration param? Purely empirically&#160;?
 Alshock: &lt;scrolling but still valid&gt;
 Wontonimo: i do it by testing.  a really high value the it becomes BFS.  decreasing it will make it stronger and stronger until it falls off
 Uljahn: MCTS is like MC except with a tree
 Wontonimo: ^^ that's right
 Alshock: MCTS makes apples
 Wontonimo: whats mcts?
 antiwonto: [automated] 'MCTS' was defined as ' Monte Carlo Tree Search ' by Wontonimo
 Alshock: I guess I'll have to resort to brutaltester if I want to test that
 Alshock: what's SA?
 Wontonimo: for very low values of UCB_C (the exploration param) you'll get inconsistent results
 Alshock: oh it doesn't handle the '&#160;:(
 Uljahn: whats ML?
 Wontonimo: oh, that's a good one I should add
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: hello
 Alshock: Wontonimo yeah it's an all in, so when it goes up sometimes it gets it right I guess?
 Alshock: Uljahn Are you refering to Mars Learning? :P
 Alshock: or Machine Lander?

 <b>**ninjadip sigh</b></p><p><img src="/a/70434983844605" /> eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: anyway, can you make a coded EMP? you guys have not answered my question
 Alshock: you have not asked your question either, what is "can you" here? 
 Alshock: and what do you mean by "coding an EMP"? What is the actual target
 Uljahn: actual goal is to derail any meaningful conversation :unamused:
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: target?
 ninjadip: the degree of  the conversation previously being meaningful is highly debatable
 jacek: oh my
 struct: jacek do people use mcts or minimax for onitama?
 struct: whats more popular
 jacek: actually i dont know
 jacek: i bet tric or karliso use minimax
 struct: Ill try mcts first I guess
 jacek: i used minimax before the NN and was top 3
 struct: I dont know minimax anyways
 jacek: do people use 'pure' mcts nowadays? except for UTTT the mcts here is heavily enhanced by eval and heuristics
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: Alshock :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers has awarded Alshock 10 tacos. Alshock now has 20 taco. eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers now has 12 taco
 struct: ept is not pure right?
 struct: neither is smart rollout right?
 jacek: eeyup
 struct: I guess not then
 struct: Ill probably just try ept 0 too on onitama
 jacek: depending how smart it is. if it plays to the end of game and heuristics only slightly influence the moves, then id say its still quite pure
 Alshock: Well, I use pure MCTS in UTTT because I wanted to make NN eval but always failed miserably at beating a good ol' random search

 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: wrong thing
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_losers: As a middle-level language, C combines the features of both high-level and low-level languages. It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also supports functions of high-level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications etc

 Idk.-_-: please someone answer this
 eve_va_hooves_the_king_of_wifes: dont know it idk.-_- sorry
 mr.nomad: same
 Idk.-_-: no problem
 ChaoticVic: wait
 ChaoticVic: ...
 ChaoticVic: so you want to convert the input into integers so you can put them through a loop. Is that the question?
 Idk.-_-: ye
 Idk.-_-: put them into a int variable
 ChaoticVic: or you just want to place the input into a variable
 Idk.-_-: into a int variable
 Quidome: scanf("%d", &amp;variableOfIntType);
 Idk.-_-: but input must be with spaces 1 2 3 4 5
 ChaoticVic: doesnt he has to make a parallel array and convert the char array to integers?
 ChaoticVic: then print out the int array?
 Idk.-_-: look mate in python will be like this x = [1,2,3,4,5]
 Idk.-_-: yes
 Quidome: for(i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
 Quidome: create the array upfront with the right size
 ChaoticVic: yeah something like that.... I gotta get my C++ not book and open an actual IDE to help you out, but...
 Quidome: int array[n];
 mr.nomad: C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language. A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet.
 ChaoticVic: if I understood correctly you want to convert that char array into an int array, correct?
 mr.nomad: right?
 ChaoticVic: was that a bot?
 mr.nomad: nope.just me
 ChaoticVic: lol k
 Idk.-_-: yes
 Idk.-_-: i want to conver the char array into int array
 mr.nomad: An academic grade issued by certain institutions. Slightly better than a C and slightly worse than a B-., just sayin
 c0d1mus: Hi guys, Iam new to this platform. I have two question: -the code of unfinished tasks will be saved forever or deleted after a while? -is there also an option to review the code of finished tasks
 mr.nomad: *C+
 Quidome: uh yes sorry, should use scanf or sscanf
 Quidome: look at this link
 Quidome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40108705/split-string-into-int-array-in-c">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40108705/split-string-into-int-array-in-c</a>
 ChaoticVic: Idk.-_-, you have to find the function in c++ that converts a char or string into an integer. when you find this fuction put it on a loop and convert the whole array at once. then print out said array
 ChaoticVic: or print each one in a loop with the space that you required in front
 Idk.-_-: damn why c/c++ is so complex :D
 Quidome: do you have to do c/c++?
 mr.nomad: C++ is a superset of C, so both languages have similar syntax, code structure, and compilation. Almost all of C's keywords and operators are used in C++ and do the same thing. C and C++ both use the top-down execution flow and allow procedural and functional programming. again just sayin
 ChaoticVic: it is. that's y i usually right these functions down. I have it somewhere but I havent used C++ in a while
 ChaoticVic: write*
 mr.nomad: im gonna go to sleep, i have slept in 12 hours
 ChaoticVic: I was playing with VB.NET on Visual Basic and I know that to convert a variable to integer all you have to do is ..... variable.ToInt32
 Idk.-_-: is java like c/c++ complex&#160;?
 ChaoticVic: or Convert.ToInt32
 Quidome: If you are starting out, better do Python
 mr.nomad: Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based and object-oriented. The programming language is structured in such a way that developers can write code anywhere and run it anywhere without worrying about the underlying computer architecture. It is also referred to as write once, run anywhere (WORA). last one, see ya
 Quidome: if you need speed, C/C++/Rust
 ChaoticVic: something like that, C++ should have something simular... but i guess more complex lolol
 Idk.-_-: i learned python
 ChaoticVic: quidome he's is learning c++ for school
 Quidome: I was asking that
 Quidome: hm, C++ it is then&#160;:)
 Idk.-_-: me&#160;? im learning for job :D
 Quidome: but first C, without the ++
 ChaoticVic: can I get the job??? lol
 CKGussin: Can someone recommend me the easiest puzzles to start off with? I've forgotten everything to do c++ and I did a degree on it haha
 struct: The descent
 CKGussin: I've done that one, I did Power of Thor too. What others are there?
 struct: temperatures maybe
 CKGussin: I'm looking for short ones to job my memory
 jacek: horse racing duals
 CKGussin: Il have a look at that one
 CKGussin: Il look at both
 jacek: space maze :imp:
 struct: horse racing should be easier yeah
 jacek: or breakthrough
 jacek: and what degree do you have on c++? -273°C?
 CKGussin: All my c++ knowledge went out the window as soon as I finished the degree. Seems like I haven't actually remembered how to do any of it or take it in after I did it
 CKGussin: Havent programmed in 6 months also
 CKGussin: Funny thing is I have an alumni interview test using this website
 CKGussin: Can take it whenever I want but need to remember how to do everything first haha
 HolyStopwatch_1b0d: I am doing an interview tomorrow and they'll use this website for me to proof myself haha
 HolyStopwatch_1b0d: wish me luck
 CKGussin: I wish you luck brother
 CKGussin: I will be on this website until I get to the standard I was once at, thing is its not really a website for learning. More to do with testing it
 HolyStopwatch_1b0d: honestly, what I find kind of good is lack of any hinting, since the hinting here is pretty shite. I have to actually code myself instead of just letting IDE finish the code for me 
 HolyStopwatch_1b0d: and yeah, I agree
 jacek: no hinting? oh
 ChaoticVic: CKGussin the horserace one is good to remember a language since you have to do conditions and loops. I also like the wone where u have to land the spaceshio
 ChaoticVic: spaceship
 ChaoticVic: would be nice if chat had a feature to tell that im replying to someone like in Discord
 CKGussin: I read it, Dont worry haha
 HolyStopwatch_1b0d: and the MIME types are very easy too
 Uljahn: ye, mars lander episode 1, it's hard to read but easy to code
 aspace: ye easy for red coder
 nulte: I dont think I can make mcts work
 Uljahn: don't let your mind limit you
 inoryy: keep at it, sometimes it just takes time before something clicks in your brain and you figure it out
 Ninjatron: what is mcts
 antiwonto: [automated] 'MCTS' was defined as ' Monte Carlo Tree Search ' by Wontonimo
 slogslog: Wow! That was a clash. Ran almost but not really.&#160;:-)
 jacek: nulte 15th not bad
 nulte: well its mcts with ept(0)
 nulte: the eval is just popcnt(0) - popcnt(1)
 nulte: ill try minimax
 nulte: rollouts are too slow here
 jacek: you can try also popcount of 3x3 center square
 nulte: hmm let me see
 jacek: rollouts are just eval?
 nulte: no rollout
 nulte: I go expand then eval straight away
 nulte: without rollout
 jacek: so how can they be slow :v
 nulte:  my sim is slow I guess
 jacek: bitboards?
 nulte: yes
 nulte: it takes me like 400ms to do 1M rollouts
 nulte: maybe I did something wrong
 Scarfield: which game=
 nulte: onitama
 antiwonto: [automated] 'onitama' was defined as ' Please someone make a PDF of this game so I can print it at home and play it ' by Wontonimo
 Scarfield: antiwonto up = a direction, specifically the direction away from the center of earth, opposite to down
 jacek: i have a name for new game - "yourself". everyone will be playing it
 Idk.-_-: how much times does puzzles take usually&#160;?
 HolyStopwatch_1b0d: i'd say anything from 10 minutes to half a year haha
 Idk.-_-: for example esay ones
 Scarfield: you will have more operations for the sim in onitama, doesnt sound that bad its about 7 times slower?
 NewCoder90: hey guys im new 
 nulte: 7 times?
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey new
 HolyStopwatch_1b0d: Hi New, I am martin
 Scarfield: 15M in 1 sec, 2.5M in 1 sec, ~7times slower
 nulte: But where do these numbers come from?
 jacek: arsefield
 Idk.-_-: i spend a 3,4 hour on a esay ones :D
 BlaiseEbuth: R nulte
 Idk.-_-: and finally can't solve it
 Scarfield: 400ms to 1M makes 2.5M in 1sec. and didnt you say you expanded 15M new nodes first turn in Ataxx
 Scarfield: oh i didnt say slower than ataxx xD
 BlaiseEbuth: ataxx the pola bea?
 NewCoder90: i just solved an easy lesson :sunglasses:
 nulte: yes something like that
 MrQuack: Does number of characters count to position in Code Clash?

 Scarfield: ah thats why i couldnt define
 jacek: how many trollouts?
 jacek: Scarfield :taco:
 antiwonto: [automated] jacek has awarded Scarfield 10 tacos. Scarfield now has 38 taco. jacek now has 31 taco

 nulte: nope
 nulte: also some cells cannot be in check for you to castle
 nulte: I dont know which for 960
 BJD: In the replay i was mated, but the game continued and i timed out
 nulte: castling in960 is a bit weird
 nulte: indeed
 jacek: yes, king cannot be in check while castling
 jacek: rook can, at least for normal chess
 nulte: But that is not the only rule
 nulte: BJD maybe you can write on the forum and put a replay there
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 nulte: Im sure reCurse will fix it
 nulte: I dont know how castle works 100% but I dont think that any cell from the rook to the king can be attacked either
 nulte: the cells in between I mean
 nulte: ok those are not the rules
 Scarfield: yea the king cannot be in check in any of the cells between and including the start and end position of a castle
 nulte: it apparently can
 Scarfield: huh
 nulte: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lichess.org/analysis/3k4/1q6/8/8/7N/8/8/R3K2R_w_KQ_-_4_3">https://lichess.org/analysis/3k4/1q6/8/8/7N/8/8/R3K2R_w_KQ_-_4_3</a>
 nulte: It can castle both sides here
 Scarfield: "Castling may be done only if the king has never moved, the rook involved has never moved, the squares between the king and the rook involved are unoccupied, the king is not in check, and the king does not cross over or end on a square attacked by an enemy piece"
 nulte: ah in this case it will not cross
 nulte: because it will move to c1
 Scarfield: yea
 jacek: hmm this doesnt say anything about checked cells <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess#Castling_rules">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess#Castling_rules</a>
 jacek: and my bot also says its 0 possible moves
 Scarfield: "Castling prerequisites are the same as in classical chess, namely: " might be all thats needed to be said?
 jacek: is there lichess for 960?
 Scarfield: "No square from the king's initial square to its final square may be under attack by an enemy piece." its the same

 ASM_MOV_INT: what would be a good first programming language for a total newb?
 Talulita: i'd say python
 Talulita: at least i think that's the easier one
 Talulita: but
 Talulita: if you then learn java or another language, it's harder to get from python to java
 Talulita: than from java/other languages to python
 Talulita: but that's my opinion (i started with C#)
 1rre: use scala
 1rre:&#160;:)
 1rre: oh wow
 1rre: unironically though learn Java, C# or C++ first
 1rre: They probably give you the biggest scope to move to other languages &amp; don't really introduce nasty habits in the way Python/Scala/Ruby etc. can
 Talulita: ye
 nulte: I think python is a good introduction but I would not use it to learn
 charname: Start with Python, it has a good community and lots of learning resources. It's also really easy to pick up. 
 DarkMatriac: I did a CoC earlier, It took me like 1 minutes to write the code and 10 minuts to figure out how to convert a char to int in c++ xD I hate c++ sometimes
 ASM_MOV_INT: rofl
 struct: now you will remember it forever
 ASM_MOV_INT: I guess I started with BASIC
 ASM_MOV_INT: then Pascal
 ASM_MOV_INT: then C
 ASM_MOV_INT: ...Assembly Language somewhere in there
 struct: o.o

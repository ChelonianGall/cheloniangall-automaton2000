 sad_nigglet: need some friend&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: word unknown. Did you mean "frontend"?
 hinammmm: i can your friend, but i not good at english
 hinammmm: some one else can add friend me in fb

 grindy: stop
 Naknik: anyone remembers the name of the challenge where there's  a string like '5+4' and you have to output 9?
 Husoski: Naknik: "Order of Oopserations!" is like that, but with a custom order of operations.  That's a nice touch since it tends to defeat using things like Python's eval() to avoid writing code.  Listed as "Hard", but it's easier than many "Medium" challenges.
 sad_nigglet: does anyone know how to optimize this: check if there exists a number x such that x^x + x = n, where n is a big integer
 java_coffee_cup: find root n, which is a good appropriation of x
 java_coffee_cup: add something to x to find the correct x
 java_coffee_cup: approximation
 Westicles: which root?
 java_coffee_cup: root of n
 Westicles: sqrt?
 java_coffee_cup: y
 java_coffee_cup: mis-read the question
 java_coffee_cup: it was x^x...no, sqrt does not work here
 TobiasA: i got promoted to master:sunglasses:
 TobiasA: the breeze up here is so nice
 Akshei: Cannot we just make x^x + x - n = 0 and try to calcualte delta?
 TobiasA: use quadratic formula
 java_coffee_cup: you are same as me -&gt; x^x is not x^2
 Akshei: ouch, you're right
 TobiasA: facts my bad
 Akshei: cannot we root to the power of x? 
 Akshei: and just make special case where n == 2
 TobiasA: that equation is true assuming n is a multiple of 6
 TobiasA: or 2
 TobiasA: no nvm
 TobiasA: if n is even then there exists a number that satisfies that equation
 TobiasA: i finally got it:runner:

 Astrobytes: base
 mufar: oh like biner or hexa?
 Astrobytes: eg. binary = base 2, decimal = base 10, hex base 16 etc
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: hi Astrobytes
 MSmits: I finished an article last saturday
 MSmits: finally
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits, caught ya finally. Didn't pick your message up til far too late
 MSmits: it was late
 Astrobytes: I picked it up about 4 hours after that lol
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: I think the article is not easy to understand. I underestimated how complicated it actually is to generate endgame books
 Astrobytes: Still haven't read it properly, just had a quick look - looks very in depth, you put some work into it!
 MSmits: thats what happens when you gradually code something, you forget how complicated the whole thing is.
 Astrobytes: This is very true.
 MSmits: thanks, anyone who is serious about doing it should get some value from it i think
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you seem to have covered all the required parts anyway
 Astrobytes: I'll finish reading it later today hopefully
 MSmits: sure, let me know if any part is unclear. The index function is hardest to explain.
 MSmits: they also have them for checkers and chess and they are tough 
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've come across them previously
 MSmits: I managed to do it for checkers too, but i quickly learned it's useless for CG
 MSmits: takes too long to generate and too much space to hardcode it
 MSmits: 3 pieces max if you're really good 
 Astrobytes: jeez, hardly worth it really
 MSmits: yea
 Astrobytes: How long did the article take you btw?
 MSmits: I am guessing a total of 4 hrs, mostly because i had to do some coding to change from my own bot
 MSmits: the writing was fast
 MSmits: my own bot has a lot of peculiarities i dont want to confuse people with
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I mean you've been pretty involved with the whole thing, you could probably present lectures on it by now&#160;:)
 MSmits: I can easily do lectures on any of these games I've been obsessed with. Kinda comes naturally when you have my job :P
 Astrobytes: Good point :D
 MSmits: this is my first workweek btw, i am a bit lucky
 AntiCheap: anyone got suggestions for the resistance
 MSmits: only teaching one morning, other than that some meetings
 MSmits: cuz i am not mentoring any classes
 Astrobytes: Nice! Sure it'll get busier soon enough
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: have to brush up on SQL 
 Astrobytes: that won't take long, it's like writing English sentences
 MSmits: only done SQL in the context of internet security, so injection
 MSmits: yeah it wont be hard, it's just a bit of a boring subject to me
 Astrobytes: I liked relational db theory
 MSmits: whats that
 Astrobytes: relational algebra and stuff
 Astrobytes: SQL is like an abstraction of that
 MSmits: oh I see
 AntiCheap: lol I didn't see it was shortest mode hahaha
 BobbyAt: when working on a learning algorithm, is there any way to save training data between play throughs?
 BobbyAt: Would be super slick to have some sort of scratch space for each user, or a small database to store stuff.
 Astrobytes: No, you have to download replay data yourself, or generate it offline
 Astrobytes: when it comes to NNs etc, everything is done offline, then you upload your bot code with the weights you've obtained
 BobbyAt: gotcha.
 BobbyAt: for downloading replay data is it just per play through?
 BobbyAt: As in from the game information section of the ide?
 Astrobytes: Easier to use the unofficial API
 Astrobytes: I recommend reading this:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>

 Astrobytes: You're welcome
 pumpkin-sweet: Who can teach me C++？
 Uljahn: can't you learn it yourself (in 21 days)?
 BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES: what are some good resources for learning c++?
 jdsigg: Looking more for learning syntax? Or making a small project
 BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES: syntax
 jdsigg: Can always just do a beginner coding course somewhere. I've used Sololearn to gather basics on languages before
 Niteblock: less goo
 jdsigg: For C++ they have basic stuff and then accelerate into more complex OOP topics
 ludowsky: Hi all. Does someone know how to complete the "Budding examiner" familly of achievements? I do not understand the "Participate x times in the ranking of puzzle solutions.".
 eulerscheZahl: 1. solve a puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: 2. the website shows you 2 solutions that you shall rank (which is better / more readable / whatever)
 eulerscheZahl: vote for one of them
 ludowsky: I see thank you.
 BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES: thanks jdsigg i'll give it a look
 derjack: oh my, the oware will be the most researched game on CG i think
 eulerscheZahl: what about chess?
 eulerscheZahl: (in terms of time invested, not successfully solving it)
 derjack: are there any articles on chess on cg?
 eulerscheZahl: no?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/58572/endgame-books-in-oware-abapa">https://tech.io/playgrounds/58572/endgame-books-in-oware-abapa</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you said "most researched on CG", not "researched by CG members"
 derjack: welp i meant people putting effort
 derjack: on CG
 eulerscheZahl: is that playground new? probably with only 52 views
 Astrobytes: As of the weekend, yes.
 derjack: now wait till people combine nn and endgames
 derjack: that would be a enndgame for oware
 Astrobytes: I see what you did there.
 eulerscheZahl: i'm rolling my eyes already
 biwanari: hi any tips on how generate shadow ascii character?
 TobiasA: you guys i made it to gold yesterday in uttt
 TobiasA: it turns out all i needed was that pragma stuff 
 WizzardFromBlizzard: hi guys
 BlaiseEbuth: Hey there.
 LuaCultist: hi
 LuaCultist: anyone else doing clash of code during class
 BlaiseEbuth: Can somebody confirm me that the "last battles" tab doesn't update without being closed/re-opened in multi?
 martinpapa69: its working fine for me
 BlaiseEbuth: 'k. So I probably have a bad interaction with a ff extension. thx
 AllYourTrees: it happens to me in chrome sometimes
 AllYourTrees: ive also been having issues with CoC not putting me in once it starts
 purevsuren015: Quickly
 purevsuren015: pls
 BlaiseEbuth: Well... Seems to work now. Without changing anything.
 ja_fica: BlaiseEbuth yes it happens to me as well
 ja_fica: in learderboard section it need to reopen, in code section it does not need to reopen
 ja_fica: at least for the other players
 Wontonimo: congrats on getting to gold TobiasA!
 TobiasA: thanks:smiley:
 ikustom: I haven't coded in so long..
 ikustom: I am so bad at coding..
 ikustom: lol&#160;:(
 martinpapa69: dont worry dude there will be moments when you feel like a programmer-god
 michaellan: yeah but those moments dont last for long
 jacek: oh my
 Marchete: 5 minutes, top
 michaellan: oh, congrats TobiasA 
 michaellan: road to legend&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Gold on what?
 TobiasA: thanks
 TobiasA: toetactic ultimate
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think anyone ever congratulated me on reaching gold&#160;:(
 TobiasA: congrats eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: thanks \o/
 BlaiseEbuth: You're only gold eulerscheZahl?! Fix it!
 eulerscheZahl: ezpz
 BlaiseEbuth: Use my starter
 eulerscheZahl: there are some games where i'm only in wood
 AllYourTrees: lol noob
 AllYourTrees: if you want to be #1 on this site you have to get out of wood leagues!
 eulerscheZahl: petition for higher leagues on community games
 AllYourTrees: +1
 eulerscheZahl: at least I got an :eyes: on my feature request
 eulerscheZahl: "Feature request: on a puzzle overview page with a viewer (like the current puzzle of the week): move the replay above the statement. It's so much more telling about what's going on than a lengthy block of text."
 AllYourTrees: is it possible to upvote it somehow?
 eulerscheZahl: go to discord and react with :plus:
 BlaiseEbuth: No need. It's not a priority anyway...
 eulerscheZahl: but i think it shouldn't be too hard to implement (we never know, sometimes those seemingly easy changes aren't that simple)
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't get what I said. No matter the difficulty, the cost or what else. It's not a priority.
 AllYourTrees: what are the priorities?
 eulerscheZahl: CG escape
 BlaiseEbuth: Money
 eulerscheZahl: CG for work stuff
 BlaiseEbuth: :money_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: if it only takes 10 minutes to change and doesn't turn into a lengthy discussion if it should or should not be changed in the first place, it might happen. we'll see
 eulerscheZahl: still waiting for an easy way to spot timeouts&#160;:(
 BlaiseEbuth: Priority: CGEscape &gt; CG for works &gt;&gt;&gt; Things THEY want add to CG &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Community requests.
 eulerscheZahl: i know my place
 eulerscheZahl: but thanks for the reminder
 BlaiseEbuth: You're welcome.
 eulerscheZahl: the bug i reported last week (solutions not getting published anymore) is already fixed btw
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course. 'cause that could be a problem for their BEAUTIFUL and USEFUL new feature of solutions review.
 eulerscheZahl: :salt:
 BlaiseEbuth: Not because you have pretty eyes.
 Westicles: that was a regression
 BlaiseEbuth: hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgflip.com/4b1bmq.jpg">https://i.imgflip.com/4b1bmq.jpg</a>
 Westicles: regressions always get fixed quickly, since it is possible to actually track down the specific guy who broke it
 BlaiseEbuth: Theory...
 BlaiseEbuth: For instance, languages that don't work anymore are also regressions but take months to be fixed, if they are.
 Westicles: Well, you can blame those on language updates, so the responsibility is outside the organization
 BlaiseEbuth: Making the updates is a decision from inside the organization. (I'm speaking about CG)
 eulerscheZahl: or the tensorflow digit recognition puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: it was broken after language update so CG just removed it completely
 BlaiseEbuth: And languages already broke without language update.
 Westicles: It is a rich tapestry :P
 Westicles: euler you were right, my Abusing the system contrib no longer works after the last update
 Westicles: C#, kotlin, ruby, and scala all died
 eulerscheZahl: c# died but no VB.net and F#?
 Westicles: Oh, those were the two I never figured out in the first place
 jacek: what you didnt figure out
 Westicles: how to launch them from bash
 jacek: oh my <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58315152">https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58315152</a>

 Wontonimo: :wave:
 BlaiseEbuth: Wontoniyo
 Wontonimo: hey BlaiseEbüth
 Wontonimo: i notice that some people don't use others actual name.  I've just been copying that.  Is there anything behind it?  or is it just so that the other doesn't see red?
 BlaiseEbuth: To avoid ping, yes.
 LittleFlea: and  i was wondering if i called my own name LittleFlea, would i see it red.
 LittleFlea: nope.
 Wontonimo: i sent you a pm LittleFlee

 LemonPi314: do you ever spend hours wondering why your code isn't working until you realize that you're reversing the list wrong?
 LemonPi314: this has happened to me too many times than I care to admit, using list.sort(reversed=True) instead of list[::-1] lol (python)

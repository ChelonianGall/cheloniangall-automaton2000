 cegprakash: hi all
 cegprakash: Paper Soccer Stream is about to start! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/cegprakash">https://twitch.tv/cegprakash</a> I'll be using GAimax and try to reach top 10
 iduel: guys
 iduel: where can i build planes for free?
 ZarthaxX: wtf
 dbdr: get hired by Airbus. Not only will you build airplanes for free, they will even pay you for it
 struct: lol
 iduel: haha, thanks for the idea
 WINWINWIN: Player can't move on already drawn line as well the pitch's lines.
 WINWINWIN: Jacek I dont understand this rule of paper soccer
 WINWINWIN: To move along a line, it has to be on a line, in which case it would have bouced
 _D_: I wonder if Mime-type is bugged for c++... Large dataset seems to fail even with a pretty optimized solution..
 tomatoes: I doubt it need any special optimization
 jrke: any body can tell what is wrong in my this python code i m new to python arrays
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/XSbugNPH">https://pastebin.com/XSbugNPH</a>
 jacek: WINWINWIN hmm?
 iduel: guys i know little Java but im getting confused some times so i was thinking if i changed to C++, or python because it is beginner-friendly (and i have a background on python) so should i change&#160;?  and try to learn it or should i continue on java?
 jacek: C++ beginner friendly? w00t?
 iduel: i mean since python have some similar features
 jacek: if you know python, switch to python
 iduel: i didnt mean c++ i didnt edit that part
 jacek: unless you care for performance
 _D_: anyone care to analyze my c++ code for mime-type? still wondering if this thing is bugged :P
 iduel: i learned both python and Java at school but i want to know which one should i pick for game Dev
 Quidome: It depends largely on what you want to do as game developer
 Quidome: and of course a personal taste
 jacek: i think for gamedev java or C# would be more suitable. i find python good for prototyping
 jacek: unity3d is C# i believe
 Quidome: If you need speed, c,C++ or rust
 jacek: for gamedev, actually pick game engine or framework
 iduel: so it depends where i will write my code, i mean if it was on unity i need to use C#, etc...
 iduel:&#160;?
 jacek: generally yes
 jacek: java and C# are quite similar and popular so learning one would cover most needs
 iduel: ok thanks
 iduel: alot
 jacek: javascript would be also popular if youre into web gamedev
 iduel: does anyone here know a site or an app to learn from scratch? for free if possible.
 cegprakash: hey jacek I reached top 17 in paper soccer
 cegprakash: I'll stream again post lunch to try to reach top 10
 cegprakash: nice game but hard to start 
 jacek: yeah. nice
 cegprakash: 200 ms is amazing
 cegprakash: :D
 jacek: at this point just making valid moves would get you to high
 cegprakash: I'm already doing that
 cegprakash: that's why I'm #17
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 cegprakash: I didn't add any algo
 cegprakash: not yet
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: just valid move towards the goal
 cegprakash: and that's #17
 cegprakash: I was shocked

 cegprakash: u killed me ez
 cegprakash: I was so close in scoring twice
 cegprakash: and u countered
 jacek: i played that game many times in school
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: haha
 cegprakash: so u know the strats :D
 jacek: pro players easily escape that
 WINWINWIN: Saw the replay, amazing last move
 WINWINWIN: Nice jacek 100% winrate!
 Illedan: 12225 :tada:
 jacek: good for you
 cegprakash: is the timeout issue fixed?
 cegprakash: I see u are #14 :o

 cegprakash: looks like I have some bug on this test
 Talchane: Hi
 Talchane: Can someone tell me how to go up in the ranking&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>anything here helps you to improve your ranking. puzzles only affect your level, not the rank
 ArianPunk: puzzles outputs are different from what I get on my own PC. I quit solving them.
 cegprakash: why is my search race car have starting trouble
 cegprakash: and the zoom size has bug on search race
 cegprakash: can't see console output on search race
 cegprakash: I had to zoom out my browser to see logs
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/470286253">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/470286253</a> at turn 0 input says the angle is 298
 cegprakash: Illedan are u there..
 Talchane: Puzzles give XP, not ranking&#160;:/
 Uljahn: Talchane: go to your profile page and click question marks to see more details
 cegprakash: when I use 
 cegprakash: should my car angle be -180 to 180 or 0 to 360?
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: Rusty bot is a multi
 hem123: anyone any tricks on creating absolute values from vx and vy without using 4 if statements?
 tomatoes: abs(vx)?
 hem123: I mean how can I create like an angle from VX/VY in a more elaborate way. So outcomes in range 0,360
 hem123: i no calculate the angle and then see what quartile it is moving too, based on that I add 90,180 or 270
 AntiSquid: not sure what you mean, i would search on google for stackoverflow answers on that
 AntiSquid: managed to find everything regarding angles there
 Uljahn: use atan2
 cegprakash: is it possible to minimize problem statement in search race?
 tomatoes: then only if's :thinking:
 tomatoes: if a &lt; 0 then 360-a else a
 cegprakash: I want to see console output
 tomatoes: or something like this
 Uljahn: cegprakash: yes, it's possible with css userstyles

 hem123: atan works perfect
 Uljahn: :thumbsup:
 hem123: atan2* thanks
 AntiSquid: get an avatar to show your appreciation
 cegprakash: tomatoes u sure?
 cegprakash: if angle &lt; 0 I'm doing 360+angle
 cegprakash: why should it be 360-angle
 tomatoes: not sure

 cegprakash: that last lap &lt;3
 struct: its the same thing
 hem123: it should + given that you have a negative number, but same thing
 struct: 360 + angle == 360 - (-angle)
 cegprakash: struct
 cegprakash: I use cos(car.angle * PI / 180)
 cegprakash: so if angle &gt; 360 or &lt; 0 do I have to take a modulus
 cegprakash: or let it be
 struct: why modulus?
 struct: just use a if
 cegprakash: yeah I use if

 cegprakash: is this correct?
 struct: no
 struct: shouldnt it be angle &gt;= 360?
 Uljahn: i guess for sin and cos there is no difference for +-360, they are periodical, no?
 AntiSquid: yes
 cegprakash: in java Illedan doesn't do that
 cegprakash:         double newAngle = Math.toDegrees(this.angle) + angle;

 Burak05: which games are good for a newbie? any suggestions?
 AntiSquid: what kind of game do you like?
 Burak05: i like strategy games
 cegprakash: BOTG
 AntiSquid: botg is moba
 Burak05: thank you very much
 AntiSquid: PR1 / PR2 is more of a strategy game
 cegprakash: do u like football Burak05
 cegprakash: if so try Fantastic Bits!
 Burak05: yes i do cegprakash
 Burak05: thank you
 struct: There are plenty of choices
 wlesavo: pr is fun
 cegprakash: I had to use 20 ms limit Illedan even 25 ms timeouts for me 
 AntiSquid: maybe multis should have a game genre tag 
 AntiSquid: i am not sure what is what myself

 WINWINWIN: For Code of Kutulu, how do the wanderers move?
 WINWINWIN: they move random or to closest explorer?
 tomatoes: closest
 WINWINWIN: thanks tomatoes
 AntiSquid: it's a bit random when 2 explorers are same distance away
 AntiSquid: see referee for details
 WINWINWIN: Ok, so distance is the only thing they evaluate based on
 AntiSquid: it has some weird priority
 WINWINWIN: Ok, will check the referee
 WINWINWIN: Code of Kutulu is pretty different, there is quite a bit of cooperation
 WINWINWIN: interesting to attemp
 ArianPunk: test 4 and 5 of a puzzle say TRY AGAIN, I just submit it, then in the next panel, it gives me green tick on test 4 and 5. lol
 cegprakash: You have reached the maximum of submissions in a row. Please try again in a few minutes.

 cegprakash: #16 on search race &lt;3
 struct: go #!
 struct: #1
 cegprakash: #1 is NN I think
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash:&#160;:'( 
 wlesavo: #1 is hardcode
 Illedan: You can do it!
 Illedan: My search uses 18 ms at avreage to find the best it uses :thinking:
 WINWINWIN: Any idea why MOVE 1 1 is effective in CoK?
 Astrobytes: Wood?
 WINWINWIN: Yes, just started
 WINWINWIN: submitted and moved to #35
 Astrobytes: That's why it's effective&#160;;)
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)

 WINWINWIN: I dont know how to minimax, but some of the paper soccer replays are amazing
 WINWINWIN: cegprakash the way it does the 1 -- 7 is amazing :D
 AntiSquid: there's already hardcode on search race? weren't there extra test cases added to prevent that? :p
 cegprakash: WINWINWIN it's only a depth of 5
 cegprakash: some ppl do have trajectory precomputed on turn 1 :P 
 WINWINWIN: :D
 JBM: fix it

 cegprakash: AntiSquid u have 1000 milliseconds to construct a trajectory
 cegprakash: it's precomputing not hardcoding
 struct:  What do you mean it not hardcoding?
 wlesavo: AntiSquid neu mann said his bot is pure hardcode
 cegprakash: when I try to move 0.1 turn my bot doesn't work
 cegprakash: not sure why
 wlesavo: i was thinking if it would be a good idea to make validators on SR just slightly random, so that cp would spawn at 10-20 dist from original spot. shouldn't introduce much randomness and would punish hardcoding quite a lot

 cegprakash: this works only with increments = 1
 cegprakash: I want it to work for increments = 0.2
 Illedan: 10 pixels is enough to make submits useless in the very top wlesavo
 wlesavo: Illedan what about 1-2?
 wlesavo: not sure if it would make any difference though
 Illedan: Would still have a few turns difference from the best to the worst setup..
 Scarfield: could done for some reason be int and not float ceg?
 cegprakash: no Scarfield

 cegprakash: this is my bot's behavior with increments 0.2
 cegprakash: so weird
 cegprakash: increments 1 works smooth
 Illedan: why 0.2?
 cegprakash: to cross more than 1 checkpoint in a turn
 cegprakash: instead of calculating collision time I can do 0.2 increments
 cegprakash: right?
 Illedan: No idea, didn't try

 cegprakash: &lt;3
 Illedan: What depth are you using?
 cegprakash: just 5 for now
 Illedan: What time on Longest?
 cegprakash: 372
 cegprakash: 370.31 to be exact
 Illedan: 342 for me
 cegprakash: oh wow
 Illedan: I have a depth of 12
 cegprakash: :O
 cegprakash: my bot acts like a drunkard
 cegprakash: if I go 12
 cegprakash: luls
 cegprakash: let me try
 Illedan: daym I fail badly on Hold The line :o
 cegprakash: u need angle in ur eval
 Snef: cegprakash don't think so
 Scarfield: depth 12 :o how many nodes do you have, or are you doing GA?
 cegprakash: for hold the line needed
 Snef: cegprakash don't think so
 Illedan: SA
 Scarfield: noice, even though im slightly insulted you scrapped my amazing code :p
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: It was great help, thx
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I'm only 3 points away from my 1 rank above guy
 cegprakash: so I need to try to get to top 15
 Scarfield: still havent tried SA, isnt it very close to GA, but with "less mutation" over time?
 cegprakash: wow increased 180 poitns
 cegprakash: #15
 Illedan: GA is about keeping a popuplation. SA is about climbing better
 cegprakash: I increased to depth 6
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 Scarfield: ok, gotta have a look at it some day&#160;:)
 Illedan: Why wait?
 struct: How many sims average'
 Illedan: 8k
 cegprakash: what only 8K?
 struct: 8*depth?
 cegprakash: u have some aggressive pruning
 Illedan: 8k x depth yeah
 Illedan: 216k sims
 cegprakash: I have 30K sims on search and 30K on mutation counting 60K easily
 cegprakash: u don't multiply depth
 cegprakash: to ur sims
 Scarfield: hmm true, but procrastination is also nice :p
 struct: ceg
 struct: 1 depth = 1 sim
 cegprakash: wait what :O
 struct: 1 move = 1 sim
 cegprakash: then mulitply my 60K * 6
 cegprakash: 360K
 struct: Sure
 Scarfield: ffc (For F**K Ceg) :p
 Snef: what are you doing struct&#160;? starting sr&#160;?
 struct: nah, I dont feel like coding AI atm
 Scarfield: only true AI?

 struct: Its clashes
 WINWINWIN: I am not able to approve / reject it
 struct: you dont have enough clashes
 Astrobytes: I believe you have to do greater than x clashes
 WINWINWIN: Ah, no then :P
 jacek: you need to invite more people into clashes
 AntiSquid: thibpat wants to do a contest on CG <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/the-unofficial-codingame-contest/185011">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/the-unofficial-codingame-contest/185011</a>
 AntiSquid: sounds like a good idea i guess
 AntiSquid: something CG should try doing imo :p
 eulerscheZahl: he plans to promote an existing game
 AntiSquid: yea
 eulerscheZahl: "If you’ve already played on this multiplayer, your rank will be your current rank minus the rank before the start of the contest."
 wlesavo: so if you top1 legend you only can go negative thibpat rank
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we've always been saying we should have multi of the month. Good on him, nice to see someone taking the initiative.Yeah the rank thing is a bit strange.
 eulerscheZahl: so if i'm at #100 before and #101 after, i'm at #1 in the thibpat ranking?
 Astrobytes: It would appear so
 eulerscheZahl: at least it's a reasonable google form: just asking for the username. no email address or alike
 wlesavo: but #1 is not good
 wlesavo: probably
 AntiSquid: :D
 AntiSquid: where can you see the participants?
 Astrobytes: If he wants to 'even the playing field' I suppose he should have some kind of handicap system based on current rank
 AntiSquid: i registered AutomatonNN so don't bother doing it too 
 AutomatonNN: with a new one
 wlesavo: hypersonic is so fun, but i think ill get legend without the rewrite i had in mind, and after that im sure ill completely lose motivation
 wlesavo: climbing was fun though
 eulerscheZahl: let's stalk him: he won't choose a game that he played before. so we can exclude the last 3 contests and twixt. rest still open :D
 wlesavo: xD
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: there's one more game he streamed i think, not sure though euler
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/525ae4b74ac3520a6ff7f7fd7cf288f10030543">https://www.codingame.com/profile/525ae4b74ac3520a6ff7f7fd7cf288f10030543</a>
 eulerscheZahl: maybe under a different account?
 AntiSquid: oh not much then
 AntiSquid: maybe i confused him with ceg's stream
 AntiSquid: hope it's an unpopular community puzzle then :p
 wlesavo: yinsh :slight_smile:
 jacek: ps
 AntiSquid: shots fired
 AntiSquid: struct
 struct:&#160;:'(
 AntiSquid: i could give you ideas for more popular game though :p
 wlesavo: i meant yavalath :slight_smile:
 struct: Maybe I can make shogi in time
 wlesavo: CSB?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess a game with a lower player count would qualify best
 struct: Going for Yavalath might a bit harsh
 wlesavo: game of life would be cool contest to have
 struct: Top bots are quite strong
 AntiSquid: struct, it's about how much your rank increases
 eulerscheZahl: so you need a new game till june 5, struct
 struct: Shogi?
 struct: or too hard?
 eulerscheZahl: and persuade thibpat that it's better than whatever he had in mind
 AntiSquid: you don't know what he is going to pick struct
 wlesavo: resubmit broken bot to every multi&gt;submit an actual bot on contest, ezpz
 AntiSquid: can't demote though :D
 AntiSquid: register an alt and have solutions ready lol
 wlesavo: hope for no league game :slight_smile:
 AntiSquid: oh wait, you can actually improve all bots on all multis, wait for contest to start before you submit!
 eulerscheZahl: then you don't want to play codebusters
 eulerscheZahl: new rules till legend
 struct: ok  time to finish shogi need my 250xp + n * 15
 wlesavo: really? wow, gave up on them after hitting gold so didnt even noticed
 eulerscheZahl: n*15?
 struct: upvote
 eulerscheZahl: upvote is 10
 AntiSquid: have shogi and chinese chess ready :D
 AntiSquid:  /s
 struct: oh right
 eulerscheZahl: moderating a contribution used to be 15
 eulerscheZahl: now it's 0
 AntiSquid: i like chinese chess btw: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.storkz.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1200x1200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/2/s20831590.jpg">https://www.storkz.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1200x1200/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/2/s20831590.jpg</a>
 struct: My only problem is that its only 30 sec games&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: had it on terminator console, learned the rules the really hard way, by trial and error :D
 eulerscheZahl: then you need another game. hurry up!
 struct: too much pressure
 struct: Ill release it next year
 eulerscheZahl: delete?
 AntiSquid: chinese chess struct
 AntiSquid: i think games would be shorter there
 struct: games on shogi are not very long
 struct: Max moves on competitive was 285 I think
 eulerscheZahl: but our bots can be dump at some point
 AntiSquid: euler, if he deletes that's basically cheating in the contest since he has no rank in any game!!
 AntiSquid: delete after contest 
 eulerscheZahl: "contest"
 AntiSquid: well for fun
 struct: What to do&#160;:( so many choices 
 struct: I could release Tzaar I have it ready
 jacek: tzaar looks like yinsh&#160;:?
 struct: They are both from gipf
 Astrobytes: All those games are playable on the same board jacek
 Astrobytes: Well, I think all of them are
 AntiSquid: reject all hexagon games
 AntiSquid: troll vs castles isn't released btw
 AntiSquid: and that go game might get released next week too
 AntiSquid: so don't stress too much struct
 Astrobytes: Where did the Conway one go?
 AntiSquid: no idea
 Astrobytes: Was just a WIP?
 struct: I think yes
 AntiSquid: guy said he is gonna improve it and it disappeared after contest
 Astrobytes: Hope he brings it back, looked alright
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't see the point of the troll vs castle game
 Astrobytes: Throw stones at things.
 eulerscheZahl: as in: i don't see a strategic way that's significantly different from just printing random
 Astrobytes: Yeah... perhaps with more maps something would emerge
 Astrobytes: Perhaps not
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see any strategical way to approach this game
 AntiSquid: more maps? the only variable for maps is road length
 eulerscheZahl: and stone count
 Astrobytes: They're related
 AntiSquid: imo it's close to fishy adventures in simplicity
 AntiSquid: wait maybe fishy adventures is the contest&#160;! :o
 Astrobytes: With additional features it might be more interesting though
 Astrobytes: It's still an early WIP after all
 MostComplicatedUsername: Troll vs castle?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 MostComplicatedUsername: Found it
 MostComplicatedUsername: Looks interesting
 AntiSquid: it only has memes at the moment
 MostComplicatedUsername: Throwing numbers?
 AntiSquid: throw maths at troll, make troll smart
 Astrobytes: *troll-y phrases/memes
 AntiSquid: those stones 
 MostComplicatedUsername: YEah I saw lol
 masrour]: bonjour 
 AntiSquid: Non
 MostComplicatedUsername: I wish I could see the number of stones the opponent throws
 AntiSquid: you keep track and deduct prev turn from current turn
 MostComplicatedUsername: I mean the number they're throwing this turn
 MostComplicatedUsername: So I can throw one higher
 MostComplicatedUsername: But that would be too easy
 AntiSquid: that's not possible simultaneous turns
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yeah
 Zenoscave: woohoo still 2nd
 Zenoscave: JBM I like the troll messages
 Zenoscave: "fix it" 
 MostComplicatedUsername: You're firs
 MostComplicatedUsername: t
 Zenoscave: nice!!!! just saw
 MostComplicatedUsername: I'm consistently beating p_b_4 but Im not even on the leaderboard&#160;:'(
 Zenoscave: lo
 Zenoscave: lol
 MostComplicatedUsername: I'm 23rd...
 MostComplicatedUsername: *sniff sniff*
 Zenoscave: pb beats me 80% of the time
 Zenoscave: I just have a really robust bot for most others
 MostComplicatedUsername: I just keep making him run out of stones
 MostComplicatedUsername: lol "I code with notepad"
 Zenoscave: 114/7/11 W/L/T
 MostComplicatedUsername: I agree
 MostComplicatedUsername: Wise words
 MostComplicatedUsername: Also, what does that mean?
 Zenoscave: 114 wins 7 losses and 11 ties
 Zenoscave: I'm tooting my own horn
 Zenoscave: not necessary but i am happy
 Astrobytes: As we say round my way in Scotland - "Nuhin like blawin yer ain trumpet."
 Zenoscave: lol
 LouysPatriceBessette: Anyone knows how to turn the suggestions off in the IDE?
 Astrobytes: You can't I'm afraid
 Astrobytes: You can stop it automatically accepting on pressing 'Enter' in Settings on the left, but can't turn it off currently.
 MostComplicatedUsername: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: how do i do the same thing
 MostComplicatedUsername: Idk how Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this is on the way
 JBM: Zenoscave: thank you
 JBM: Zenoscave: please contribute some too! :D
 Zenoscave: I am still thinking of one
 Astrobytes: Braindump a whole load of them and post on the contribution page&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: contribution page?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507070b7925f661e2d2835c14f950b9d157e">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/507070b7925f661e2d2835c14f950b9d157e</a>
 MostComplicatedUsername: Comments
 Zenoscave: I might submit a new TvC bot. just worried i'll drop
 MostComplicatedUsername: Test it on an alt first
 Zenoscave: It's a minor change and would probably be top 10, don't want to smurf that high
 JBM: hey Zenoscave since you're top3 your opinion counts more to me:
 JBM: do we want to try and compress multiple matches against the same opponent in a single game?
 Alshock: the lifepoints system?
 JBM: that's an implementation detail
 JBM: but yes
 MusaBrt: hi guys
 Zenoscave: I would say, multiple matches would work if there was a wider variety of maps
 Zenoscave: pb is right. there's too few maps
 Zenoscave: for that goal at least
 JBM: that's a trivial fix
 Alshock: how can you say it's trivial? Have you thought of all the wonderful assets you'll need to scale to longer maps? :P
 Astrobytes: I agree on map variety and the match compression (fwiw, I'm not in a worthy placement :P )
 Astrobytes: I believe it would add interest, especially for those otherwise uninterested
 Zenoscave: definitely
 struct: What if there are 10  maps at once
 JBM: that's superlegend league
 JBM: quantum matches
 Astrobytes: Shush struct and get back to working on Tzgtyrwz or whatever it is :P
 struct: Tzaar?
 Zenoscave: tzaar?
 struct: Tzaar is finished but never released
 Astrobytes: Yeah 
 Zenoscave: is yinsh finished?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: Yes Zenoscave! 
 JBM: i personally am not too convinced multiple matches per game would really improve much
 Amrhossam: what are you talking about today
 Astrobytes: And struct made an excellent job of it
 JBM: but maybe the ranking top has insight i don't
 Zenoscave: Ok i will have to play
 Astrobytes: JBM, you can try it out - that's what WIP stage is for after all
 Amrhossam: guys what is something that is used to make chat apps?
 JBM: that's another thing i'm not too confident around
 Amrhossam: is web development is it called sockets&#160;?
 JBM: what happens to the rankings if i add/remove leagues?
 struct: When you add league the boss of that league will submit
 Astrobytes: I thiiiiiink they fixed that issue, before it used to reset, but I believe it leaves rankings untouched now
 struct: once that submit finishes all players above get promoted
 Astrobytes: It's on the discord somewhere
 struct: and resubmit
 JBM: and people stay in the league they were in?
 JBM: what if I remove one?
 Astrobytes: dammit, where's euler when you need him
 struct: I dont know
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000 get euler
 Automaton2000: is there someway i can get more
 JBM: the sdk shouldn't be so dependent on a third-party
 JBM: so raci^Whelpful may he be
 Zenoscave: Automaton2000 the need for euler is strong
 Automaton2000: it happens to me too
 Astrobytes: lol JBM&#160;:)
 JBM: ikr
 Astrobytes: Hmm, seems the only thing I can find is related to optim games.
 Astrobytes: Changing code or validators no longer clears the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Not sure on multi
 trictrac: hello all, last time struct you ask me for a game&#160;: what do you think about hanabi --&gt; cooperative game. Is that possible on CG&#160;? how to evaluate bot&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Ooof. You think that would work well on CG?
 Astrobytes: Interesting game for sure, never seen it before.
 Zenoscave: Like Code ala mode style co=op?
 trictrac: It's the same principle than calm
 Astrobytes: But are you able to ignore the other players as most did in CalM?
 Zenoscave: boardgames are structs realm
 Astrobytes: *successfully ignore
 struct: I will check it trictrac
 trictrac: cool
 AntiSquid: i suggested hanabi before, nobody listened trictrac
 AntiSquid: i played it IRL, not sure it's as fun as a CG game though
 AntiSquid: i mean IRL you can give the weirdest possible hints
 Astrobytes: It looks possible, worth a shot I guess
 AntiSquid: well it's like OOC and CalM :D
 AntiSquid: combined
 Astrobytes: Hey I didn't say I wanted to play it :P
 Astrobytes: irl game looks fun though
 struct: So I should do  like a team of N
 struct: vs another team of N
 struct: and who gets best score win?
 struct: Oh i guess thats what he meant when said it was hard to eval
 Astrobytes: Team score + MVP bonus? Just guessing
 Astrobytes: Donno how to eval MVP but... 
 Snef: Astrobytes i think you  can only say who won and who lost
 Astrobytes: Not even with who was best with hints and stuff?
 Snef: well you can do ranking mybad
 Snef: so that mvp for the team who lost can still be ahead of the worst of the winning team
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 Astrobytes: Just think aloud btw, I've never actually played it
 Astrobytes: *thinking
 ktotam: Onitama bugged?
 AntiSquid: there is only 1 team in hanabi struct
 Astrobytes: MVP it is then
 jacek: onitama? why
 struct: I know there is only 1 team
 struct: but I to score it can be trick it
 ktotam: pass doesnt work, command like "15 PASS" is correct?
 struct: So I could do two teams
 struct: and which one has better score wins
 AntiSquid: well max score is 25 per gameso imo give max score if people know how to cooperate and comunicate&#160;? 
 darkhorse64: You can only pass if you have no other choice
 AntiSquid: otherwise they get a fraction
 AntiSquid: or does the ladder not allow this?
 struct: it doesnt allow
 AntiSquid: lame
 struct: I guess ill continue Shogi
 jacek: ktotam you can only pass if there is no valid move
 AntiSquid: but then you probably end up with 6-8 players per game&#160;?
 struct: Yeah AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: coop optimization doesn't work does it lol
 struct: no
 ktotam: jacek ok, ty
 Astrobytes: It's a 2 player+ game
 Astrobytes: So you don't need a huge team I guess
 AntiSquid: hm 2 to 5 apparently
 AntiSquid: played it as 5 so w/e
 AntiSquid: 2v2 then :p
 Astrobytes: Is it fun?
 AntiSquid: well it's funny when people try to give hints without giving exact info
 Astrobytes: lol
 AntiSquid: you're not allowed to tell the card someone is holding
 LelouchVC2: "imagine trying to hold a candle without your hands!"
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw that
 AntiSquid: and then people start debating if the hint was too much of a spoiler or not
 LelouchVC2: And slowly resent each other
 Astrobytes: hahaha, I can imagine how this plays out
 AntiSquid: and then you end up with weird jokes
 LelouchVC2: I confuse between u two all the time astrobytes and antisquid
 LelouchVC2: like the same person to me
 struct: Also on community multies you dont have mirrored matches
 struct: so it wouldnt be totally fair
 AntiSquid: and in real life people don't have good card tacking / memory like bots, so there's disapointment when someone fails to remember what was played and what not
 Astrobytes: Idk how that's possible LelouchVC2
 AntiSquid: probably avatars too similar
 Scarfield: AntiBytes
 Astrobytes: lol AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: AntiScarf
 AntiSquid: the pointy eared cat super cluster
 Scarfield: AstroSquid has a nice ring to it though&#160;:)
 LelouchVC2: lmao!
 Astrobytes: True, so does Squidfield
 Scarfield: Barffield *
 LelouchVC2: Idk about that one
 Astrobytes: Didn't she sing a song?
 Astrobytes: Oh that was Whigfield
 AntiSquid: no, hypster motorbiker in space driving without helmet is hopefully shot down by aliens! :p
 Scarfield: would make for a good avatar
 Astrobytes: AstroScarf

 struct: I wonder if I should release it :p
 AntiSquid: struct do alpinist
 LelouchVC2: Anyone seeing these protestors
 Scarfield: should give my avatar a scarf some day
 Astrobytes: Board games so damn expensive these days, tf for CG :P
 AntiSquid: maybe that's not the name&#160;? :thinking:
 struct: yeah cant find it
 Astrobytes: He means Allpenis struct
 Astrobytes: Not from here LelouchVC2, but I've been checking the news yeah
 struct: also im not really a fan of games that have rng
 BenjaminUrquhart: spaghetti
 Astrobytes: penne?
 AntiSquid: struct it was on this website, not sure about the title anymore:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamelist">https://boardgamearena.com/gamelist</a>
 AntiSquid: more shit if you need inspiration:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tabletopia.com/">https://tabletopia.com/</a>
 AntiSquid: honestly you could just combine / change rules and make your own version
 AntiSquid: found the game struct:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=cantstop">https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=cantstop</a>
 struct: Why dont we have battleship?
 AntiSquid: could roll same dice for both players 
 Astrobytes: Because you haven't made it struct
 Astrobytes: Very rng AntiSquid, not sure it would be any fun on CG
 struct: Ok for next month
 struct: I must make 1 game per week
 struct: or delete
 Astrobytes: Here we go again :D
 struct: lets flood multies
 AntiSquid: then do Pazaak 
 Astrobytes: tf is that?
 struct: Im so bad at shogi&#160;:(
 struct: Its ridicolous 
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTVApCx3RP0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTVApCx3RP0</a>
 AntiSquid: why does that matter struct? you just need to implement the rules correctly? do you need source material for the rules or what
 Astrobytes: jeez
 AntiSquid: if it's too hard just do chinese chess, i promise it's fun
 struct: Its not hard, I just wanted to try a few games
 struct: I like how hard it is
 struct: I keep forgetting that opponent can place the pieces that he captured on the board
 Astrobytes: Star Trek bat'leth battles, with actual Klingon language, on a 3D chessboard
 struct: Also playing vs 10 depth both as a begginer is not nice&#160;:(

 IamTheSmix: hello everyone

 LelouchVC2: I made this if statement:

 TheNinjaRobot_85: if ((N += K)  &gt;  K)
 Astrobytes: You're evaluating K and K
 LelouchVC2: Don't correct me god damn it
 Astrobytes: Don't ask for help then :shrug:
 LelouchVC2: :o
 LelouchVC2:   woulld have been first place if i didn't accidently type in a character in my code that made it not compile right before submitting&#160;;-;
 Astrobytes: keep operator precedence in mind in future
 LelouchVC2: That's not the issue
 LelouchVC2: I wanted it to be that way in order to kill 2 birds with 1 stone
 LelouchVC2: for shortest round

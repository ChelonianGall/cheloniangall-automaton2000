 AryanTripathi: scored 92.5% in my exams lesssss goooooo
 AryanTripathi: @nicola you always online but you don't chat lmao
 eulerscheZahl: 92.5% less than what?
 eulerscheZahl: nicol a is mostly active on #fr
 emh: good morning
 eulerscheZahl: the source code is confusing me.when i disturb an opponent, i have to give a card (so far, so clear)when i don't have a skill card anymore after giving, i get to draw a new card?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L435">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L435</a>
 kovi: If they do not have any skill card in hand, they get 2 Technical Debt cards. 
 FootDuck: subscribe to technoblade
 FootDuck: wrong chat
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i understand from the statement too
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't get how the code reflects this
 eulerscheZahl: also: "when i don't have a skill card anymore **after giving**"
 eulerscheZahl: so: i have 1 skill card. i pass it on. i have none left. ?i get a new one?
 kovi: you are right code seems quite different from description&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i try to trigger the case and analyze the replay
 eulerscheZahl: hm, won't occur often
 eulerscheZahl: i should just finish the sim to my understanding of the rules and then analyze any differences to the real one
 therealbeef: i think that get number of cards to throw can never be 0 at that point
 therealbeef: it seems not updated by giving a card
 therealbeef: and if you had nothing to throw you had nothing to give either
 therealbeef: so the give card function wouldn't be called
 Ayushman965: hey are there ever any contests for less experienced coders? (like me)
 Ayza: It's really the leagues Ayushman965
 Ayza: but you probably always still need some experience for the first league
 AshamanCooper: The sping challenge was a good one, with the spiders. The video will walk you though the first bit to give you an idea on what to do, and you can improve it as you learn. This one I keep thinking I got it, just to still be missing a part to win not using random... 
 eulerscheZahl: the spiders couldn't convince me, too heuristic-heavy
 AshamanCooper: I had to look that up, but would that not just be programing in a nutshell...? 
 eulerscheZahl: there are other games where you can simulate the game a few turns ahead to analyze the possible outcomes of your actions
 eulerscheZahl: more fun for me personally, feels less like patching one thing and breaking some other instead
 AshamanCooper: It does feel like reaction a lot of the time.
 AshamanCooper: YES!!! passed division 1 of wood for the Green Circle. I have been at this all day!!
 TINOUAINANI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642193728">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642193728</a>
 TINOUAINANI: in 30 how I RELEASE an application with just 7 skills without getting a dept card&#160;?
 TINOUAINANI: can some one help me&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you did some automation before
 TINOUAINANI: oh i see thanks 
 eulerscheZahl: frame 15: CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION 8
 jacek: i can get to ~20th but when i woke up i was 5th. so all i need is just to wait :3
 AshamanCooper: wth is the cardTypeID??
 [SG]Sebastien: AshamanCooper: it's the numeric id (0 for training, 1 for coding...7 for refactoring, 8 for bonus)
 AshamanCooper: Just figured this out, even seeing this 5 min ago would have helped, thank you. I had a repl on my card class that I forgot about and made debugging worse lol. 
 jacek: when PLAYED_CARDS was added lol
 emh: jacek with the update yesterday
 emh: hmm.. my release criteria is mostly myScore &lt; opponentScore.. kinda works, but I should find a better idea I guess as I'm usually behind opponent in this way
 emh: release critera with debt that is
 jacek: Automaton2000 where are your cards
 Automaton2000: it used to be an easy puzzle
 therealbeef: we're way past that point Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i have a better version
 raxkin: Can anyone explain me this case:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642227670">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642227670</a>
 raxkin: And similar for the next releases
 TINOUAINANI: can I throw the bonus card in POST ADMINSTARATIF?
 tobk: Can someone explain what exactly ARCHITECTURE_STUDY "The team will draw one more card at the beginning of their turn." means? I can pick 2 (or 3, 4, ...) cards from the desk I MOVE to?
 emh: raxkin each skill card has 2 good skills and 2 shoddy skills. it adds up
 emh: and the shoddy skills are of any type
 raxkin: emh i know, but it have 2 skill card and 1 bonus, that's 2+2 + 1+1, so it's not able to release the app that requires 4/4
 raxkin: missing 2
 emh: you have 2 coding and 1 training. that's 6 good skills and 6 shoddy
 emh: tobk nope, not from the desk, from your draw pile at the start of the turn. instead of 4 cards you get 5,6,7...
 raxkin: it's on the blue guy
 raxkin: that is releasing
 emh: ohh
 tobk: emh ah, that makes sense, thanks!
 emh: raxkin he has 4 automated bonus
 emh: you can see if you hover over his player
 raxkin: Oh i understand it now
 raxkin: thanks
 Dream1234: good morning
 tobk: does an "automated" skill card still provide 2 good + 2 shoddy, or just 1 good?
 MSmits: still does everything tobk
 tobk: Thanks! But like "permanent" they are still gone after the release, right?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: continuous integration is *really* permanent
 tobk: Oh, that's nice! Thanks again.
 jacek: they are more permanent than permanent skills :thinking:
 MSmits: np
 tobk: The rules in this one are really complex...&#160;:-D
 Dream1234: have you guys done algorithms on hackerrank Im struggling with TBS problem and spieses reviesed
 MSmits: well, the complexity is not that big, but everything is really wordy
 Dream1234: okay thx
 MSmits: if they just called it mana or something with various colors and the colors having specific powers, you would not find it as complex
 tobk: The explaining video being in french does not help that much, either (although the automated subtitles are some help)&#160;:-P
 AshamanCooper: far to much.. I think I have my code to the point I can get it to do most anything, it tracks alot, but I am not sure what to tell it to do..
 Dream1234: interesting
 MSmits: AshamanCooper now the real test begins&#160;:)
 MSmits: what was the new location? "PLAYED_CARDS"  ?
 AshamanCooper: I haven't watch it yet, but I am hoping this will help me understand.  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/dlat7r5FygU">https://youtu.be/dlat7r5FygU</a> let see how inspired it really was, hopefully alot. 
 MSmits: exact wording i mean
 DaNinja: PLAYED_CARDS 
 MSmits: it doesn't show up when i reset the code (in the comments)
 MSmits: ah ok thanks
 DaNinja: its shwon in the "Next cardLocationsCount lines:" section
 DaNinja: *shown
 MSmits: you mean in the statement
 jacek: so they didnt update stub
 MSmits: apparently not
 jacek: dat QA
 MSmits: it's better if they do, for players that join this weekend
 MSmits: lol c++ is the worst. I added the cardlocation to my bot, but forgot to increase my cardsarray by 10. It just happily runs and starts overwriting memory locations. 
 MSmits: i start releasing apps that dont exist
 emh: why are you using c++? do you need performance? are you writing sim?
 MSmits: yeah i am trying to
 MSmits: might need performance, might not
 MSmits: hard to say at this point
 emh: I feel it's gonna be too hard to write a probabilistic sim
 MSmits: dont want to have to convert next weekend
 emh: hehe
 jacek: "i start releasing apps that dont exist" thats reminds me of something
 MSmits: also, even though C++ is way worse than working with C# for example, i do it a lot, so my familiarity with it offsets the inconvenience
 eulerscheZahl: for me c# is both more convenient and more familiar
 emh: I like C++. avoiding pointers I rarely segfault anymore
 jacek: the problem with C++ is it works overwriting some memory then much later BAH!, some random error
 MSmits: C# has a lot of useful features I don't know about
 jacek: at some other place and you look into that place
 eulerscheZahl: C# adds so much in every big release, i lost track as well
 MSmits: jacek yes that is what just happened to me. Thankfully i noticed the error relatively quickly. Could have taken me hours
 MSmits: btw, i might create a local arena in C#
 MSmits: if i have the time
 MSmits: some windows forms thingy
 MSmits: since cg benchmark isnt really an option anymore
 eulerscheZahl: try the new .ne MAUI. it's platform independent
 eulerscheZahl: .net
 MSmits: why is it useful for it to be platform independent?
 eulerscheZahl: so i can use it too?
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: ok
 MSmits: i need to use something thats familiar to me. I use windows forms every day 
 eulerscheZahl: well, not sure if linux is even part of maui&#160;:(
 jacek: so you can run arena in the phone youll win in this contest
 MSmits: lol
 eulerscheZahl: it's for windows, macOS, android, iOS
 eulerscheZahl: and in the end you just add a single webview to the UI and do the rest in Blazor
 MSmits: uh ok...
 MSmits: something to investigate wen i have more than 9 days 
 MSmits: when
 emh: I've reached a plateau with my bot. waiting for a new meta. or lightning strike me with a new idea
 eulerscheZahl: youtube: Tim Coreydoes great tutorials to get you started on various .net technologies
 AshamanCooper: What are sims and why is performance on here import. is that just good practice? I am new and those statement make no sense to me. 
 MSmits: thanks, will note that down euler
 eulerscheZahl: Nick Chapsas for deeper insights on small details. like memory management and performance with C#
 MSmits: AshamanCooper sim means simulating the game state when you make a move
 jacek: it may not be that important in this contest, but it is important in many bot games
 MSmits: preferably you should be able to see the result from applying various moves and pick the one that gives the best result
 MSmits: the more you simulate, the more time it takes, so you want it to be fast
 jacek: think of chess engine analyzing deeper moves
 MSmits: if you dont know how to do this, dont worry about it in this game really. There's simpler games to learn how to do this with
 MSmits: simple if/else rules will go a long way herew
 emh: ahh Zylo resubmitted that's why I'm 3rd
 Zylo: ok, I'm looking...
 Zylo: (not here, sorry)
 emh: haha
 Zylo:&#160;:-P I've answered for old comment and then I got a new ones
 Zylo: emh: for now top5 play in different way but have similar "play power"
 jacek: ifs power
 emh: hmm ok
 emh: rock paper scissors
 MSmits: mmh you can use TASK prio on 2 cards of the same type?
 Zylo: I have many loops also&#160;:-P
 MSmits: that seems unproductive :P
 MSmits: also it seems like you cant pick a bonus card with it?
 emh: can't you pick a bonus card by picking from an empty desk?
 MSmits: not sure, maybe&#160;?
 MSmits: I just meant you cant use index 8
 MSmits: as a target
 emh: yeah
 MSmits: but you can point to your own bonus card with it
 MSmits: so 8 7 is ok
 MSmits: 7 8 is not
 kovi: permanent skills cannot be used for release?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: they are in your discard pile
 MSmits: you used em
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: i thought you meant the continuous integration card itself
 MSmits: but thats not permanent
 MSmits: you mean daily routine 
 MSmits: and architecture
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: you used those and you get a separate modifier for having used them
 MSmits: when you use them they go into played cards, then discard, then back into draw
 MSmits: so you can use the same daily routine card multiple times and they stack
 MSmits: but you cant release with it on a turn where you played it
 kovi: my original question:can i use them while in permanent position for release or not?
 MSmits: no
 kovi: thx
 emh: MSmits ahh I seem to have botched the selection of bonus cards for TASK_PRIORITY after a change. added a TODO
 MSmits: i am confused about 1 thing now though
 MSmits: do they go in discard when used?
 MSmits: or is this permanent position a card location?
 kovi: no. they stay with "player"
 Astrobytes: I still have no idea what I'm doing
 MSmits: is it a card location?
 kovi: they go to discard after release
 MSmits: yea ofc
 MSmits: but where do you get them in input
 MSmits: it's one of the 5 cards, so where is it?
 MSmits: hand/played/discard/draw&#160;?
 MSmits: Astrobytes many don't
 MSmits: i sort of understand most rules and can sim them, but other things confuse me
 Astrobytes: oh they added PLAYED_CARDS
 Astrobytes: Yeah, some of the details are a bit vague
 MSmits: very
 emh: I didn't bother about PLAYED_CARDS but now I realized you need it for cards left
 Astrobytes: saves us having to track it manually at least
 MSmits: yeah i was worried about having to do that
 MSmits: mmh can someone check this. Near the end of the game (frame 104 for example). The architecture cards count up to a total of 4. This suggests the "permanent"  architecture skill also takes up one of the 5.
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642262387">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642262387</a>
 MSmits: which means that when you want to calculate how many cards are in the desk, you also need to take into account the permanent skills of the players
 wlesavo: MSmits yeah, all permanents are consumed
 MSmits: so not just 5 - hand - draw - played - desk - 2x auto, but also subtract the permanent for archi and daily
 kovi: yes, those are "slots"(disappear from all other piles)
 MSmits: that's very easy to miss though
 emh: I missed it
 MSmits: wlesavo "consumed" is a very dubious statement
 MSmits: the important thing is the card locations
 wlesavo: not obvious from the rules, as many other things
 MSmits: apparently the permanent skills are 2 more possible card locations
 wlesavo: MSmits well i mean it in the way it is not present in any hand or board
 MSmits: yeah i got that now&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's just all very confusing
 Paroni: Thinking of this as an actual board game helped me a lot I think. Most rules are pretty intuitive that way. For example, the permanent cards are tracked by having them in front of the player on the table. 
 kovi: exactly(i just thought that they can be used as well - before discard)
 jacek: you just need to buy physical copy
 MSmits: they disappear from the hand in the viewer kovi, thats how i know they cant
 MSmits: there's just a permanent skill nr that goes up +1
 kovi: yeah, i though they are like automated
 kovi: with spefic additional benefit
 MSmits: automated are weird too as they can *only* be used for release
 eulerscheZahl: the list of valid inputs implies that TASK_PRIORITIZATION can only take a skill card. but reading the source it's also legal to pick a bonus card, isn't it?
 MSmits: yep, but its not
 MSmits: you can trade away a bonus card
 MSmits: but not receive one from the bonus pile
 MSmits: but you can receive one from an empty skill desk
 MSmits: so 7 8 is allowed and 8 7 is not
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: the other way around
 MSmits: 8 7 is allowed
 eulerscheZahl: are you sure?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L288-L291">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L288-L291</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i should be able to pick up an 8
 MSmits: I am just going from the random actions i get offerd
 MSmits: maybe it doesnt show up in random
 eulerscheZahl: also those tiny things really pull me off while readingthrownCard vs cardTaken
 eulerscheZahl: can't you call it takenCard for consistency?
 MSmits: yeah]
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06051f91-d9fb-419e-a7ac-6cb049508340">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/06051f91-d9fb-419e-a7ac-6cb049508340</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and that's my point: i think the list of actions doesn't 100% match what we are allowed to do
 MSmits: there is no 2nd index 8
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: time to hardcode and see, i guess
 MSmits: well good that makes things easier. In my sim i should only consider picking up bonus cards directly from the bonus pile then
 MSmits: and ignore empty desks
 Astrobytes: but what about "If you need to draw a skill card from a desk and there are none left, you will draw a BONUS skill card instead.If there is no BONUS skill card left, you will get no card."
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83eb8cac-ad88-4d7d-9649-0f67783f4030">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83eb8cac-ad88-4d7d-9649-0f67783f4030</a>
 MSmits: yeah not all possible orders are in there jacek
 MSmits: you miss task 7 8
 MSmits: for example
 jacek: w00t
 jacek: this is from referee :f
 MSmits: huh
 MSmits: where in referee?
 jacek: that is, not my sim
 MSmits: is this the possible actions from the random selection or is this some limit on the actual possible actions?
 jacek: possible moves from hundreds of random games
 Rafarafa: task priority needs a skill card I think
 Rafarafa: that's why no 8 right? 
 MSmits: yeah so you are taking this from the list of randoms jacek
 MSmits: this list is not complete, it doesnt give you all the options you have
 MSmits: Rafarafa you can give away an 8 according to the list, but not take an 8
 MSmits: which is wrong if you read the source code
 MSmits: you *can* take an 8
 Rafarafa: wait so the tooltip is wrong?
 MSmits: throw new GameRuleException(command, "you can only deprioritize a card type between 0 and 8");
 MSmits: throw new GameRuleException(command, "you can only prioritize a card type between 0 and 8");
 MSmits: from the referee
 eulerscheZahl: 8 is bonus
 jacek: inclusive or exclusive
 MSmits: inclusive
 MSmits: because we already know 8 is allowed for giving away
 eulerscheZahl: the question is, what i can get instead
 MSmits: how do you mean euler?
 eulerscheZahl: wait a moment, trying to hardcode it
 eulerscheZahl: frame 26<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642283199">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642283199</a>
 eulerscheZahl: getting a bonus for a skill card. this should not be possible according to list of possible inputs provided
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L734">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L734</a> there is the code that doesn't generate the 8s
 eulerscheZahl: TASK_PRIORITIZATION 7 8
 MSmits: nice one eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 jacek: darn. will they fix the inputs or restrict the 8?
 MSmits: it's not really an issue tbh
 MSmits: only people who dont generate moves lose this option
 Astrobytes: well since it's wrong it kinda is :D
 MSmits: and they can just pick an empty desk for a bonus anyways
 jacek: i dont generate moves ;f
 MSmits: yeah ok, but it is a small issue compared to so many other confusing things
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i read the code instead of messy statement
 emh: there is not always an empty desk though
 Smekarn: euler: Was TASK_PRIORITIZATION 7 8 among the possible moves given to you? 
 MSmits: if there's not, you can get your favorite card, why would you want bonus then
 eulerscheZahl: painful to make progress but you catch this kind of easter-egg
 emh: MSmits ahh true enough
 MSmits: ye reading the source definitely helps
 eulerscheZahl: Smekarn i don't heve the inputs for this specific turn, but:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1f82586-ce41-4dcc-bc74-946da341ebf6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d1f82586-ce41-4dcc-bc74-946da341ebf6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: they never offer you to trade an "x 8" but it's possible regardless
 eulerscheZahl: referee even handles that case separately
 eulerscheZahl: so doesn't look accidental to me
 Smekarn: I see, nice catch!
 struct: So I can do TASK_PRIO 0-7 8?
 Astrobytes: Yes
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: TASK_PRIO 0-8 8?
 MSmits: you can trade bonus for bonus
 Astrobytes: oh right you are
 struct: so TASK _PRIO 0-8 0-8?
 MSmits: yep
 struct: thanks
 MSmits: we are here all day figuring out to the rules for you :P
 Astrobytes: getting another coffee
 struct: jacek will have to starting generating moves
 struct: its not too hard I guess
 MSmits: yep
 jacek: :scream:
 struct: I think making a NN work might be harder than generating moves, but what do I know
 MSmits: it's super easy, barely an inconvenience
 jacek: nah, its impossible for this game due to not perfect information
 MSmits: it's still possible using azero style
 MSmits: it's just crazy hard and if you dont make it in 9 days you have nothing
 struct: The hardest part of this game is the sim part of admin
 struct: imo
 MSmits: because the throw happens in 2 phases?
 struct: even if it was just one
 struct: I just add pending move to gamestate
 MSmits: looking at my sim function for it you are correct, it is the largest, but mostly because it is 2 cards
 MSmits: you dont want to double the possibilities so i consider 2 identical and then do the i 0 to 8 and j i+1 to 8
 MSmits: as card A, then card B is the same as card B, then card A
 MSmits: and you need to keep track of the throw phase so your sim knows there is only 1 card left to throw
 struct: But you are not taking into account card A card A with that are you?
 MSmits: yes i am 
 MSmits: 2 identical
 struct: ah
 struct: didnt read the start sry
 MSmits: np, you see,the size of my chattext is parallel to the size of the function
 struct: lol
 emh: I also have a big function. it's called main
 emh: where everything lives, more or less
 MSmits: I have some advice that will blow your mind emh
 emh: MSmits what is it?
 MSmits: make a function void MASSIVE_IF_FOREST()  . this will clean your main right ip 
 MSmits: up
 emh: hehe
 struct: Next thing is are going to say is that you use the online ide
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: i have a dilemma
 MSmits: my solver now picks the winning moves with the lowest TD
 MSmits: but if i input training and code cards, the solver no longer predicts the win, but a win probability
 eulerscheZahl: TD? tower defense?
 MSmits: technical debt
 eulerscheZahl: makes more sense in this context
 MSmits: so do i want the highest win probability or do i want the lowest TD
 emh: struct I do use the online IDE
 Astrobytes: was hoping for temporal difference
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i shouldnt call it win prob, i should call it app-5 release probability
 emh: I don't have too many ifs. just 50
 Astrobytes: that is indeed a dilemma. I would say test it
 struct: I need probabilities? im screwed
 MSmits: this is starting to look very similar to locam
 jacek: Temporal Difference?
 MSmits: in that game i would use brute force and usually only use 1% of calc time except in rare instances where it used all
 jacek: oops not scrolled
 MSmits: you also had phases in a turn there
 emh: oops wrong file.. I do have too many ifs. 160
 struct: more ifs than all my bots combined
 MSmits: in code a la mode i had over 300 ifs
 MSmits: and i used a beam search :P
 emh: hehe nice
 emh: 160 ifs. 49 else. 49 for loops.
 emh: 1309 lines
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: difficult bot to modify
 emh: yes especially there's repeated distance desk take code everywhere
 emh: after daily routine skill
 Astrobytes: 560 lines and all it does is read the input and store it :o
 MSmits: oh that, i didnt even get around to simulating that
 Sheeesh---: i just crashed the game
 Sheeesh---: and didn't save the replay
 Sheeesh---: what a waste
 jimliu: hi

 MSmits: oh i copy moves there
 MSmits: except when is solve the game,it is funny
 Astrobytes: uttt == uncooperative tictactoe
 MSmits: yeah
 Sheeesh---: it dosen't happen in arena tho
 Sheeesh---: doesn't
 Sheeesh---: just got scammed
 struct: It should even if rare
 struct: They referee is the same
 StevenV: Hello guys
 ~Gambit~: can a bonus skill be a shoddy skill
 Astrobytes: one good, one shoddy
 struct: Bonus = one good point for any skill and a shoddy
 emh: uhh ohh 12 losses in a row against Zylo's new submit. down to rank 5
 ~Gambit~: ok 
 Astrobytes: debating whether or not to continue along the sim-based route or just make an if-forest :thinking:
 struct: Im gonna finish the sim
 struct: Because then I can use it anyways
 struct: It wont be wasted
 Astrobytes: true
 DaNinja: 210 lines now, debating whether to bother with a sim
 struct: Im coding a sim because im not very good at coding heuristics
 vsa: too much caffeine.
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: (struct)
 emh: my Master thesis was a heuristic
 emh: but more loops than ifs
 MSmits: my Master thesis was a sim :P
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: what would be a simple algorithm to use with a sim for this type of game?
 MSmits: (not kidding)
 MSmits: brute force = try all moves
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: so run to the max depth that time limit allows, and choose best first move?
 StevenV: I think another Heuristic
 MSmits: dont want to say too much, but no not necessarily like that in this game, try to fully understand the game first
 emh: just took a shower. a good heuristic is to wash the dirty areas more
 Astrobytes: A wise decision.
 MSmits: I feel dirtier reading that than when I saw your csb modification
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 StevenV: csb
 MSmits: mad pod racing
 emh: hehe
 StevenV: where is antiwonto?
 MSmits: he changed the pods for another thing starting with p
 StevenV: ah
 Astrobytes: Pandas
 MSmits: naturally
 StevenV: is the bot still there, let me check
 struct: :taco: Automaton2000
 MSmits: he doesnt want to get banned for it
 Automaton2000: and i forgot to change it
 MSmits: might be copyright infringement, not sure he used his own p
 Astrobytes: :D
 emh: what's wrong with pandas eating eucalyptus?
 MSmits: nothing, it's cute
 emh: see. you have nothing to worry about
 MSmits: true
 eulerscheZahl: if it's his P, it surely isn't his V
 StevenV: panda won't eat eucalyptus
 struct: I dont think thats true
 MSmits: are you objecting over realism StevenV?
 struct: There are a lot of eucalyptus in portugal but no pandas
 struct: I think its related
 MSmits: solid proof
 eulerscheZahl: because you have a panda-repelling stone
 StevenV: haha
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm2W0sq9ddU&amp;ab_channel=notesonvirginia">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm2W0sq9ddU&amp;ab_channel=notesonvirginia</a>
 MSmits: oh, did not get that reference
 MSmits: I must be too young
 MSmits: it's a good rock to have though
 MSmits: it rocks
 StevenV: I just realize that the card in hand got discarded at the end of the turn :D
 MSmits: milestone reached
 StevenV: haha
 Astrobytes: Pandas eat bamboo 
 StevenV: yup
 MSmits: hey, so if you accidentally play daily prio, you can now crash your bot by only providing one index on the move command?
 emh: ahh so it's Koalas
 emh: who eat eucalyptus
 Astrobytes: Yes. 
 Astrobytes: And koalas are not bears.
 emh: bear with me I'm not a zoologist
 MSmits: koala bears are not bears?
 Astrobytes: But pandas are.
 Astrobytes: Giant pandas at least.
 Astrobytes: MSmits: no they're marsupials
 MSmits: o
 MSmits: I just googled the :poop: out of marsupials
 emh: I need a koala to optimize my mars lander
 StevenV: same
 Astrobytes: marsupials = think pouches for carrying young
 Astrobytes: kangaroos etc
 MSmits: yeah it's ok Astrobytes your job is done. google is handling the follow up
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: OK. Test on Monday, 9am sharp
 MSmits: got it
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: I'm mostly submitting for detecting crashes/bugs
 struct: gets rank 1
 MSmits: heh not possible, i am only simming the last turn
 StevenV: ___
 MSmits: doing the simplest possible heuristics for other turns
 StevenV: I am a Java dev, so ...
 StevenV: sim algorithm is far
 MSmits: far?
 emh: I'm not a Java dev, but I'm doing GC in Java because of the good starter bot
 Astrobytes: out of reach I think MSmits
 MSmits: ohh
 StevenV: too far for me to get the algorithm work good enough
 struct: I'm not a dev so I use C++
 Astrobytes: LOL emh
 Astrobytes: same struct. C++: the language of non-devs
 StevenV: I used the starter bot for Java for the 1st day, and well the bot won't even compile
 StevenV: wasn't
 Astrobytes: they fixed that I think StevenV
 StevenV: yeah
 emh: one of my friends likened malloc to Molloch, the demon
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: Is there any way to give tech debt to opponent?
 MSmits: never used malloc
 MSmits: struct not directly
 eulerscheZahl: so you are more of a calloc type of person?
 MSmits: but you can block desks so he has to skip over you and pass admin desk
 MSmits: i havent used any allocs
 struct: I see, thanks
 MSmits: i just use fixed arrays for everything
 Astrobytes: I suppose memset is Memnoch then
 emh: I coded a kd-tree to lookup in freedb once. I think I used malloc there
 struct: brb
 emh: Astrobytes lol
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 emh: Astrobytes do you like Ardbeg?
 Astrobytes: The single malt?
 emh: yes
 emh: I have one in the closet. it's smoky as hell
 Astrobytes: Yes I do. More of a Talisker guy but I really dig most of the Islays
 emh: nice
 emh: I haven't tried Talisker
 Astrobytes: Yeah the peatier and smokier they are the better, imo
 Astrobytes: I've been to the Talisker distillery on Skye, beautiful round there
 emh: cool
 Astrobytes: and they served 16-18 year old Talisker in the pub: very very nice
 emh: have you seen "richard patterson how to drink whisky" on youtube?
 emh: it's entertaining
 Astrobytes: no I have not
 Astrobytes: Noted for later watching
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRonhQdRdQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frRonhQdRdQ</a>
 Astrobytes: thanks!
 Astrobytes: I like him already :D
 Michael_Howard: Is the number of cards left on a desk given somewhere or do you just count who was where on a MOVE gamePhase?
 MSmits: hmm, say you dont have daily prio &gt; 0, can you still use move 3 3
 MSmits: Michael_Howard no it's not given, you need to calculate
 Michael_Howard: Thanks.
 MSmits: yay it works
 MSmits: MOVE 7 7 😀
 MSmits: with no daily prio. You can still specify the desk you want to take it from
 struct: it works before it thinks its a player message
 struct: it works becasue*
 MSmits: mmh
 MSmits: I guess
 Mathieu_Hidalf: z
 Mathieu_Hidalf: z
 Mathieu_Hidalf: z
 struct: dont spam
 StevenV: no daily prio, you can output move 7 6 and it still work
 struct: ofc it works
 struct: Working as intended
 StevenV: and 6 is player message in this case
 therealbeef: just like move 7 42
 MSmits: well i am just going to assume the referee is smart enough to understand i want to move to desk 7 and get a card from desk 7 :P
 struct: It should work yes
 struct: or you can just check if a == b
 struct: when you output
 MSmits: yeah i guess
 MSmits: but i am lazy
 Chinmay_1729: hey guys
 struct: hi
 MSmits: hey
 MSmits: allright, i am going to try to sim the training card... this is going to be painful
 struct: Everything is painfull
 MSmits: you mean this whole game
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: or is this your general outlook on life?
 struct: The worst part is move, to throw, to give to apply action
 struct: Both
 MSmits: thats all parts except release
 kovi: the flow is just messy
 emh: poor simmers. my sympathies
 MSmits: simpathies
 emh: hehe. the last game I remember simming was Fantastic Bits. a lot of work
 aCat:&#160;:-)
 MSmits: it is , but this one is especially difficult because of the random element
 struct: Im just gonna use the bot I made for backgammon
 aCat: yeah random inside your actions is painful
 emh: lucky you struct writing reusable code
 struct: emh the joke is that my backgammon bot is cout &lt;&lt; "random\n";
 struct: so in theory I have the same bot
 aCat: but its not that cpp is fast enough to do some expect here?
 emh: ohh hehe
 aCat: random sims or test expected values
 struct: I have an idea of what search to use
 struct: If it will work or not, I have no idea
 struct: I never really played game with rng elements like this
 MSmits: locam had this, but people just ignored the rng
 MSmits: you could get away with that
 MSmits: in this game you cant because of the train and coding mostly
 struct: Could you draw cards during your turn on locam?
 struct: ah ok
 struct: You type too fast MSmits
 MSmits: people only simmed their own turn on locam and maybe the opponent turn while ignoring their hand
 MSmits: but noone simmed a second turn
 kovi: afaik there was no time for that
 MSmits: actually there was, most turns took 1 ms to sim
 MSmits: but too much unknown
 struct: There was plenty of time, you had 30 days :p
 MSmits: that too
 emh: lol what happened I'm numero uno
 struct: grats
 emh: thanks to 9 wins in a row against Zach-Leee
 emh: thank you struct
 JamesWrank: Anyone to help me out a little at the first Mad Pod Race&#160;? Not sure why my ship isnt moving I just added a simple condition&#160;:(
 JamesWrank: if x == next_checkpoint_x: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e326e6bc-34cc-4731-818a-9e2ab49e085a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e326e6bc-34cc-4731-818a-9e2ab49e085a</a>
 struct: sure
 struct: print(str(next_checkpoint_x) + " " + str(next_checkpoint_y) + " 50")
 struct: you always need to print x y and thrust
 JamesWrank: Ooh alright
 struct: the first if and elif make you output illegal actions
 JamesWrank: So i'm not sure how to make it move straight then ^^
 struct: Ok so try removing the part that you pasted
 jacek: you can reset to default code and then fix the y y thing
 struct: Yeah
 struct: do what jacek said
 struct: should be easier
 struct: Reset is on top right of ide
 jacek: "do what jacek said" - struct
 jacek: always trust jacek
 JamesWrank: Alright I listen to jacek ^^
 MSmits: do what jacek is almost always a good idea except when it isn't
 MSmits: 60% of the time it works every time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ctrl+Z, love  good undo
 JamesWrank: So the fix here is just in the output line&#160;? Don't need any condition&#160;? 
 struct: yeah for first league you should only fix the output
 emh: I should make instructional videos for csb newbies. pay to view. point of view
 JamesWrank: Alright that's a hint! thanks guys &lt;3
 aCat: is there a difference between played and discard?
 struct: yes
 struct: because discard pile can still be shuffled to the draw pile
 struct: during your plays
 struct: abut the played cards cant
 struct: but*
 aCat: yuu sure?
 struct: 50%
 aCat: so if I do training lot of times
 aCat: hahaha
 aCat: not what I expected
 struct: if you do training a lot of times they all go into played cards
 aCat: yeah but you should draw more
 struct: you still do
 struct: but you cant draw the played cards 
 struct: That were played between move and release
 struct: of that turn
 aCat: so if i empty my discard, more trainings wil not draw from played?
 China-xyh: Does anyone here would like to play a Clash of Code?
 struct: Correct aCat
 China-xyh: #clash
 JamesWrank: -Oh my god
 struct: played go into discard after release I guess
 JamesWrank: I didnt see there was 2 y in the output
 JamesWrank: That was so simple I overcomplicated it so much :D
 struct: np
 ~Gambit~: can someone help me (green cirlce). With continous_integration skill i can automate one card, can't I automate  continous_integration card type
 struct: you can 
 struct: but you need to have 2 in hand
 kovi: and automation is only for release
 struct: ^
 ~Gambit~: yeah i'm trying keep one in automation. I'm getting a error. i only have 2 card
 therealbeef: so you also cannot task prioritize itself back to the board?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: This event is confusing,  some phases only happen if u have a training card in hand?
 eulerscheZahl: skill card in general
 [SG]Sebastien: phases only happen if you have a decision to make
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or a release is available... but could drop a ton of debt on you if u don't wait
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so wierd
 eulerscheZahl: oh, Sebastien is here. i have an annotation to make
 eulerscheZahl: frame 26<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642283199">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642283199</a>getting a bonus for a skill card. this should not be possible according to list of possible inputs provided but the game allows itTASK_PRIORITIZATION 7 8
 struct: Was the game crashing reported Sebastien?
 eulerscheZahl: right, the crash...

 struct: damn its not even possible to get the seed to reproduce
 eulerscheZahl: referee crashed before serializing those info
 struct: but you can get this info though
 struct:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: how?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Nice Spliterator
 struct: maybe not the seed
 struct: but the error you can
 JohnyDaison: Is the bug with Task Prio and CI fixed already or not?
 eulerscheZahl: i copied the replay link from Sheeesh---
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean find the bug from stacktrace?
 struct: yes
 struct: its given in replay 
 struct: But yeah seed seems impossible to get now
 Sraiti: here we go again
 struct: maybe Sheeesh--- can reproduce it and share another replay with the seed to make it easier for you
 [SG]Sebastien: JohnyDaison&#160;: it was fixed yesterday evening
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm so confused.  How can i calculate the technical debt received from a release? Where's the shoddy count for a Hand card?
 emh: phew I survived the Paroni attack&#160;:)
 emh: I'm just sitting here like a guard dog watching my position
 Paroni: :P I think I made my bot worse by fixing it :D
 Sheeesh---: i actually changed a lot from my code
 emh: hehe. classic
 Sheeesh---: can't reproduce it anymore
 [SG]Sebastien: for your hand, your shoddy skill available = 1*BonusCount + 2*SkillCount. But you do not use all of them (you only use enough to replace the missing skills
 struct: But you submitted to the arena right?
 struct: it should be in history Sheeesh---
 [SG]Sebastien: eulerscheZahl: indeed, a TASK_PRIORITIZATION 7 8 was not planned
 Sheeesh---: there are 3 code that are 4 hours ago dunno which one
 struct: ah ok
 struct: Will it be fixed Sebastien?
 eulerscheZahl: it was planned, check the source code. you even handle that case specifically
 eulerscheZahl: there was also another thing that confused me in the code. let's see if i find it again
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L435">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle/blob/62fb2c43108c1dd7d7fd2da8041f43567be36774/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Game.java#L435</a>
 [SG]Sebastien: well, in that case, let's say this a feature and not a bug&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: why do we possibly take a new card after giving one?
 ToshiTuringMachine: PatrickMcGinnisII I also don't understand how to calculate technical debt
 eulerscheZahl: surprise reward for disturbing
 eulerscheZahl: note: i didn't see it happen in a replay, just stumbled over it in the code
 [SG]Sebastien: you move, if needed you throw, if needed you give, and only after all that, you take the card from the desk in which you arrive
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tx seb, i think...still confused...I guess I take the release requirements and multiply by 2, and subtract 1 for every bonus card I have that can be used?
 eulerscheZahl: aah
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i thought that would be an extra function. not the clearest naming&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: giveCardAndDrawOne()
 [SG]Sebastien: oh sorry. I did try to have good names, but I did not always succeed
 Zylo: emh: I move you to the first place&#160;;-)
 emh: yes hehe thank you
 ToshiTuringMachine: was the infinite loop solved?
 [SG]Sebastien: yes
 [SG]Sebastien: no more infinite loop
 eulerscheZahl: hm, then my code might handle things in the wrong sequence. i allow to give a card i just took&#160;:(
 [SG]Sebastien: this is not good
 jacek: :neutral_face:
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I have a Move-&gt;Throw-&gt;Give-&gt;Gain order of functions
 MSmits: Gain is like an artificial phase for me
 [SG]Sebastien: this is better
 eulerscheZahl: i think i'll move the pickup part before the play
 eulerscheZahl: refactoring incoming
 eulerscheZahl: i mean: 7
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 kovi: yep, i have a similar internal flow
 therealbeef: you can even throw a card to the location you're moving to and pick it up again
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: reverse boomerang
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, so now we are playing Freecell
 tobk: Example output shows "TASK_PRIORITIZATION 8 2" and "GIVE 8", but those would actually be illegal, since 8 = Bonus Card, right?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: you can give and gain bonus cards with task prio
 MSmits: even though the gaining of bonus cards does not show up in the allowed moves list
 MSmits: so 8 7 is possible and 7 8 also
 tobk: Okay... thought the bold "skill" in all the description is to emphasize that distinction, but good to know then.
 eulerscheZahl: i think i saw some players move to the admin office to avoid the technical debt penalty. is this a thing or did i get confused watching?
 MSmits: hey, if you have 2 plays left and your first play is given as "WAIT", do you still get the second?
 MSmits: confused i think
 eulerscheZahl: oh, ok
 MSmits: i dont know how you'd even move there
 MSmits: it has no index
 eulerscheZahl: then i can delete some of my code again
 MSmits: you are as slow as I am this contest
 struct: cant be slower than me
 struct: I probably will have something ready by the time gold opens
 MSmits: well you produced more lines of code in the same amount of time struct 
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i struggle to motivate myself
 MSmits: ahh i have no struggle this time, last time i dropped out without trying though
 MSmits: I'm just slow because its a lot of work
 struct: yeah
 struct: Its a lot of work to get a sim
 MSmits: ye
 eulerscheZahl: in the end i always have the goal to reach legend. keeping up with traditions
 jacek: darn who would have thought String.format() is so expensive
 MSmits: that's my goal too
 MSmits: well my realistic goal
 eulerscheZahl: at least i just finished a 161 frames match without crashing. that is producing valid actions and picking one at random
 MSmits: grats
 eulerscheZahl: now onto comparing outcomes with actual gamestate
 eulerscheZahl: will surely uncover some bugs
 jacek: valid_actions = ["RANDOM"]?
 eulerscheZahl: everything but "RANDOM"
 struct: So I have the same thing that euler has
 struct: the move gen
 eulerscheZahl: in theory i can also predict the outcome of my moves
 [SG]Sebastien: eulerscheZahl: you move to the admin office for the THROW phase. It is only a small break in the move pahse
 struct: Well I can do that but its bugged
 eulerscheZahl: ah, bonus frame in the replay
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, we don't know what cards opponent has in his hand, but we can speculate
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someone code_review my lawn mower
 jacek: reject
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm seeing that bonus cards are finite
 struct: yes 36
 ToshiTuringMachine: if i have x cards in draw pile, and must draw y cards, how many possible combinations are there?Is that the superset?
 ToshiTuringMachine: i should have studied more at univ
 ToshiTuringMachine: instead of playing prince of persia
 PatrickMcGinnisII: where does the bonus skill card come from if a desk is empty?  how many are there?
 struct: It comes from the middle pile
 struct: it has 36 cards - the number of bonus players have
 MSmits: have, meaning in hand/draw/discard
 MSmits: they cant be in playable afaik
 MSmits: played
 MSmits: oh... i need to track plays too. This is another complication
 MSmits: especially if you chain training/coding cards
 struct: its not too bad I think
 struct: Maybe it is
 MSmits: no single thing is bad, it's the combination&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh ok, working out the maths...I thought there were only 5 extra bonus cards.   So at game start I'm seeing 4 bonus in each players possession, 28 bonus in middle, and then 5 skill cards at each desk
 struct: I havent reached that part yet
 struct: yes patrick each desk as 5 skill cards
 struct: when it runs out of skills it starts giving bonus instead
 MSmits: which is not necessarily worse
 struct: The only downside is that they dont have skills
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it was the bonus cards that were killing me, since they reduce the need to collect technical debt.  I assummed the race at beginning of game would be to collect the 'rare' bonus cards.  I'm seeing a bunch of random games going 200 turns...where bonus cards are all gone
 MSmits: a lot of games that last 200 turns are just played by bad bots
 MSmits: try look at the top 50 games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i know my observations are newb. sry.  So far I'm not seeing anything super difficult, just trying to wrap my head around it.  The first day, I had to walk away. heh.
 MSmits: yeah no worries, we are all newb
 struct: So let's say I have in hand [2, 1, 0...]
 struct: so only 3 cards
 struct: and I go through admin
 struct: If I choose to throw card [1]
 struct: do I still need to throw another?
 struct: or the referee does it alone?
 therealbeef: i think the referee takes over if you have only 1 possible to throw or all throwable cards are of the same type
 MSmits: yeah so if you have only 2, there is no throwphase turn for you
 MSmits: if you have 3, you need to do both phases
 MSmits: because after throwing 1, there are 2 left
 MSmits: so there's a choice
 MSmits: (both times)
 struct: but what if those 2 are the same type?
 struct: after throwing the 1st one
 MSmits: i did not check, but i doubt the referee is smart enough to deal with it
 MSmits: it should not matter for your bot anyways
 struct: I guess its not very importantt
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: in that case, if you have 5 cards of the same type, it should skip also
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: or if you have 4 TD cards, and 2 other
 MSmits: i actually think it does skip that
 RIT: when you release an application, do the cards you used to release it go back into your discard pile?
 RIT: and same question for when you use skills?
 MSmits: When you release an application, your permanent skills are discarded.
 struct: and the cards in hand are also discarded
 MSmits: when you use a skill it is also discarded, but it goes in the played cards pile first, to prevent you using the same card two times in a turn
 MSmits: (infinite training loop)
 RIT: By "discarded" are they deleted from the game or do they go to my discard pile to be reshuffled into my draw pile eventually?
 struct: after release phase all cards in hand are discarded
 MSmits: nothing is ever deleted
 struct: doesnt matter if you used them or not
 RIT: oh ok
 StevenV: even if you don't release, cards still get discarded
 MSmits: which is the main reason those if bots are so strong currently. Not playing cards is a major waste.  They are discarded anyway. But simmed bots that play cards are still being worked on
 StevenV: which bots are so strong?
 StevenV: you mean the boss 1, 2?
 struct: to answer my question
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642361842">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642361842</a>
 struct: Frame 70
 struct: I discard 4 and I have 2 cards of same type
 struct: the referee doesnt handle it
 MSmits: the top bots in bronze StevenV
 StevenV: ok
 MSmits: right struct, so you need to do work there
 struct: this is not very green
 StevenV: 2 cards of same type?
 StevenV: what is the problem?
 struct: There is no problem
 struct: It could just auto discard one
 struct: since I dont really have an option
 struct: its a forced move
 StevenV: you mean frame 72 where you give a card and throw 1 card?
 MSmits: no he throws 2 cards, but there is only one way to do that
 MSmits: because 2 of the 3 available are identical
 MSmits: so the referee could have just done it for him
 StevenV: 2 / 3, so he could throw 2 type of cards
 StevenV: or 1 type of cards
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: actually yeah
 StevenV: I mean he could throw 1 card type A and 1 type B
 StevenV: yup
 StevenV: so the referee is correct
 MSmits: no 
 struct: but after I threw the first
 MSmits: the 2nd was 2 bonus cards
 struct: the reamining one s are of the same time
 struct: type*
 struct: ...
 StevenV: no
 struct: my typing
 struct: yes it is
 StevenV: after the first
 StevenV: there are only 1 throw
 StevenV: the other are GIVE
 struct: no
 struct: Input actions: 2THROW 4THROW 8
 struct: Input actions: 1THROW 8
 struct: Input actions: 2WAITARCHITECTURE_STUDY
 struct: There is not even give
 struct: because it gives the only card I have
 MSmits: so there were 2 throw turns
 struct: yes
 MSmits: and one of the throw turns there was 1 option
 StevenV: how can 2 throw turn?
 MSmits: btw StevenV we are not saying the referee is wrong, it's just less efficient
 struct: Yeah
 StevenV: no
 MSmits: you need to throw 2 cards
 MSmits: at admin desk
 StevenV: What I see is 2 throw and 1 give
 MSmits: that's correct, in the viewer that happened
 StevenV: I see from frame 70 to 72
 MSmits: but that doesnt mean the bot got a turn
 MSmits: he didnt get a give turn, because there was 1 card
 MSmits: but he did get 2 throw turns
 MSmits: but the second throw turn there was no choice to be made
 MSmits: so he should not have gotten it
 MSmits: just like the give turn
 StevenV: 2 throw turn = 4 cards?
 MSmits: no, 1 card each
 MSmits: throw is actually 2 separate phases
 StevenV: I know
 MSmits: so 2 cards
 struct: When you can throw you always get 2 throws
 StevenV: what I see is you got near opponent right?
 struct: yes
 StevenV: so there is 1 give
 struct: The give is automated by the referee
 MSmits: but he also passed admin first
 struct: since I only have 1 bonus card in hand
 struct: Its a bit confusing
 StevenV: you mean the 2nd thrown isn't automated right?
 MSmits: it isn't, but it could have been
 MSmits: if they coded it that way
 MSmits: since there is no choice to be made
 StevenV: all I see in the replay is "random"&#160;:(
 MSmits: yeah that is structs output unfortunately
 StevenV: Maybe I see it wrong with automated
 MSmits: lazy struct
 Washier: hehe
 ToshiTuringMachine: if discard pile is empty you don't receive it from inputs?
 struct: no idea, probably not
 struct: same for played cards
 StevenV: and automated cards too
 ToshiTuringMachine: oh yes seems so. gotta update to all zeroes when not received a deck
 MSmits: memset (0)
 jacek: memeset
 MSmits: thanks btw, i just did that
 struct: = 0
 Harsh_Chourasiya:  Hey
 DeadlyTokyo: hi
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Hey all -- I have a pending classic puzzle that is really good, (fun and educational) but just not getting any love.   it has a few upvotes but no comments or Approvals.  If anyone is bored, please check it out.  Any feedback (good or bad) is appreciated, but of course "Approval " is the goal&#160;:)
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/182986ce43712d2b4e105ac72cacc96208e53">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/182986ce43712d2b4e105ac72cacc96208e53</a>
 StevenV: many are busy with the challenge, I guess :wink:
 MSmits: Lisa-Has-Ideas these next 9 days people are very busy playing the contest. You might have better luck after that. 
 MSmits: I am non-stop coding personally
 jacek: everyone busy with backgammon
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: (Thanks)
 struct: I dont understand why my draw pile is empty if I have cards in the discard pile
 therealbeef: i think it only refreshes the draw pile when it needs to draw
 struct: so if I use training and have cards in the discard pile and no cards in the draw pile it will refresh?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: ty
 MSmits: just not from your played cards pile
 struct: yeah
 struct: ty again
 struct: I can only imagine how hard could it be to write a statement for this game
 MSmits: me too
 jacek: easier than for backgammon?
 struct: I think backgammon is on par with sim difficulty
 jacek: many edge cases?
 struct: yes
 struct: If you can play all the dices you must play all, if you can only play 1 dice you must play the highest one, its not too bad
 struct: My referee doesnt know this though
 struct: Since I wrote the referee without reading the rules...
 jacek: artistic freedom
 Donotalo: are desk-0 and desk-7 adjacent?
 aangairbender: yes
 struct: yes
 Donotalo: can i move from desk-N to desk-N in next move phase?
 kovi: contest is not in cgstats yet?
 aangairbender: Donotalo you can't
 MSmits: Donotalo you cant stay at your desk
 Donotalo: hmm, thanks
 struct: Magus decided to go green and save the servers
 eulerscheZahl: hey jacek, ille told me you are NNing the contest. really?
 eulerscheZahl: kovi you can add it by tampering with the URL
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/green-circle/eulerscheZahl">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/green-circle/eulerscheZahl</a>
 kovi: cool, thx eulerscheZahl
 struct: jacek already hiding his bot
 eulerscheZahl: where was he before?
 MSmits: 30-40th
 MSmits: last time i saw
 eulerscheZahl: oh, not bad
 MSmits: so he made a reasonable heuristic bot
 eulerscheZahl: didn't really check the leaderboard yet
 struct: You misspelled NN
 jacek: and how would you NN this game 
 eulerscheZahl: got my sim somewhat working and submitted a bot with the most basic eval
 MSmits: how well is it working?
 struct: jacek dont ask me, I cant even NN hexapawn
 eulerscheZahl: that's what confuses me. not the usual board game but a hell of a mess
 eulerscheZahl: 73rd right now, MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: you can have my scoring:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3687f59c-9554-4463-a240-a781125ac068">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3687f59c-9554-4463-a240-a781125ac068</a>
 MSmits: nice
 struct: just read recurse pm after the contest, maybe he will show you
 MSmits: you score this at the end of your turn i assume
 kovi: copied my eval&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, after RELEASE phase
 struct: random search?
 MSmits: yeah i am doing the same thing, but currently only for winchecking the final app
 eulerscheZahl: brute force, everything
 MSmits: me too
 eulerscheZahl: only 1 turn so it's doable
 eulerscheZahl: "turn"
 kovi: yes, for 1 turn it works
 MSmits: it's probably not doable for chaintraining/coding with a large draw pile
 kovi: the problem is how it can get strategy
 eulerscheZahl: you need long-term thinking, which will be a pain
 kovi: (evolving eval)
 kovi: yes
 MSmits: isn't it always
 eulerscheZahl: still not sure how to tackle this game
 MSmits: well you solved part of it
 MSmits: i think your way is correct
 jacek: ez. the same way you'd tackle magic the gathering [solved]
 eulerscheZahl: it's just boilerplate code, nothing solved yet
 struct: Im not sure my bot can calculate all the states
 MSmits: it should be able to if you only play 1 train or code card
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i time out in some edge cases, no idea
 eulerscheZahl: i can possibly do more trainings
 MSmits: it depends heavily on the size of your deck
 struct: if you have daily routine and architecture it can be problematic I think
 MSmits: daily routine doesn't explode that much, it's mostly training cards that do
 eulerscheZahl: we will see
 MSmits: daily routine adds maybe a factor of 3 or so, maybe 5
 eulerscheZahl: but not today anymore, i achieved my goal of the day
 MSmits: you achieved my goal of the day too
 MSmits: but i sleep later, so... 
 eulerscheZahl: was 380-ish before. now i'm ready for silver
 MSmits: seems like it
 struct: I hope I have something ready before silver
 struct: lol
 jacek: silver 20 jun
 eulerscheZahl: monday
 jacek: you can delete 3 accounts before that
 struct: I see you are optimistic jacek
 struct: only 3?
 jacek: how many alts do you have
 struct: lost count
 eulerscheZahl: nulte
 eulerscheZahl: tobou
 eulerscheZahl: struct IIstruct III
 struct: lol
 jacek: Automaton2000 how many are there
 Automaton2000: but its still the same
 Astrobytes: class, enum, namespace
 struct: stop pinging me Astrobytes
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: So on Task Prio I first take the card and then place mine on the board?
 struct: Its what I understand from the referee
 struct: but the statement says the reverse
 struct: :confused:
 MSmits: how so?
 KinaKhongs: Hey, did you have any hint as to how I can improve my code in green_circle, i'm trying to figure if some MTCS can do the job, but i can't even implement it haha
 MSmits: if you havent ever done a succesful mcts, really dont try it here
 MSmits: it's sooooo much harder
 MSmits: try it on a simple boardgame first
 jacek: and simple mcts wot probably work here
 struct: MSmits like do you place the removed card first on the board?
 KinaKhongs: Ok x), i will just do some basic simulation every turn then
 struct: or do you take the card first from the board
 struct: and the place yours on the board
 MSmits: why does that matter?
 struct: Because if the room was empty
 struct: and you place the card
 struct: you can take it again
 struct: but if it was empty and you take first than thats not what happens
 MSmits: i dont even consider desks that are empty, if i want a bonus card i'll just take it from the pile
 struct: yeah Ill probably will ignore them after too
 emh: I felt between sleeping and coding, so decided to make myself a dark and stormy. but too bad I accidentally bought _lite_ ginger beer. hate unnatural sweeteners
 therealbeef: struct: throws are processed before pickups
 struct: Thanks therealbeef
 therealbeef: so you can 'throw' a card to yourself
 therealbeef: though i don't really see the need
 Astrobytes: emh: dark &amp; stormy is THE drink :DI agree on the sweeteners&#160;:/

 struct: I think not therealbeef
 struct: The thrown is only added after cardTaken
 therealbeef: oh i thought you meant throwing and pickup from new location
 struct: ah like on move
 therealbeef: i think you're right about the prio
 therealbeef: yes
 Zandy156: has the challenge changed like bug fixes since Thursday?
 struct: yes
 struct: Played cards do not go to the discard pile anymore
 struct: they go into a player cards pile
 struct: and only after release those cards will go back into discard pile
 struct: release or end of turn
 Zandy156: that doesn't affect wood 2 league though I guess?
 struct: I think it does
 struct: not sure
 Zandy156: there's only move and release phases in bottom league from what I could tell
 struct: oh so shouldnt affet
 struct: affect*
 Zandy156: before I was having an issue with my output for release phase being registered before my move phase
 Zandy156: but either whatever I changed fixed it, or something with the challenge was causing the issue
 tobk: Why isn't the event put back into "last activities" after testing or even submitting? it's just pushed away be recent puzzles and you have to do three clicks to get back to it. :weary:
 Astrobytes: yeah it's annoying tobk, I saved the link as a bookmark instead
 eulerscheZahl: CTRL+D
 eulerscheZahl: same idea
 Astrobytes: but I was faster eh :D
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps Astrobytes around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: stupid me wrote STRG first and had to delete
 struct: I didnt even notice it was so many clicks
 struct: maybe i need to close the ide more often
 Astrobytes: lol euler 
 eulerscheZahl: do you even turn off your computer over night?
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: I do unless I'm downloading or installing something or maintenance etc
 eulerscheZahl: in a timeframe what i would call night?
 Astrobytes: struct gets his sleep, he just gets it very late
 struct: I have a lots of problem falling asleep 
 emh: I never turn off computers
 struct: even worse when I go to bed right after coding
 jacek: ill turn off computer once i quit vim
 emh: well.. sometimes I close the lid of my laptop, I don't know what its response is
 Crosility: I turn off my computer, I just never close tabs I use constantly.
 struct: When I was coding my breakthrough bot I couldn't fall asleep
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 emh: I'm watching quiteLola on twitch. done with coding for the day
 eulerscheZahl: we need a sleepthrough multi
 emh: same same struct I often have problems sleeping after coding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Screensaver is an awesome nightlight
 Astrobytes: I have an ext HD that blinks all night and illuminates the room unless I remember to cover it or can turn off
 emh: I have a ghost pacman which can serve as a nightlight
 emh: it was a present
 emh: it also has disco mode
 Astrobytes: though in the summer when I go to bed it's usually getting light, only about an hour or 2 of actual dark
 MSmits: 2&#160;??
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have coindrop sound setup when I get online purchases ... better than rain sounds to help with sleep.  I'm hald deaf, so yes I can hear the darn CG notifications from anywhere in the house...smh
 struct: it happens if you go to bed at 4 am
 MSmits: how far north art you
 MSmits: are you, not art thou, was not trying to be classical
 Astrobytes: :D
 emh: usually I have a fan blowing wind on me while I am sleeping. especially if I am overheated by alcohol
 Astrobytes: Central scotland isn't that far north but it's still only an hour or 2, worse in Sweden
 MSmits: you're supposed to drink it, not burn it
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 emh: burn the calories
 emh: I'm 140 kg
 PatrickMcGinnisII: em=electronic music
 emh: should update my profile picture to a chubby cute one instead of menacing haha
 eulerscheZahl: E=m c²
 MSmits: ahh, should get one of those bicycle thingies i have behind me. Turn on netflix, half an hour of cycling and back to coding
 MSmits: efficient
 emh: ohh I know that equation, it means you burn square the energy when coding much c
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: correct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ℏ
 jacek: e^pi - pi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I know what that means... "Keep your hands above the equator"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :raised_hands:
 therealbeef: 140? woah, your avatar looks like agent 47, emh
 emh: hehe. thanks
 therealbeef: drinking and coding just go so well together
 emh: there's the xkcd graph showing the relation
 Astrobytes: Ballmer peak
 therealbeef: this morning i woke up and looked at my bot code and didnt remember writing it, but it was good code
 Astrobytes: I'm like that even if I wrote it sober :D
 emh: therealbeef did you get a deja vu at least?
 MSmits: I am always sober and always think my code is crap
 MSmits: maybe i should drink
 emh: should I change my profile pic to this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://emh.lart.no/publish/phatman.jpg">https://emh.lart.no/publish/phatman.jpg</a>&#160;?
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 jacek: “If an important decision is to be made, they [the Persians] discuss the question when they are drunk, and the following day the master of the house where the discussion was held submits their decision for reconsideration when they are sober. If they still approve it, it is adopted; if not, it is abandoned."
 Astrobytes: If you want emh, we're not judging, well I'm not anyway
 emh: nahh I prefer my younger self. it puts terror into the hearts of my opponents
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: there is always the cat avatar option
 Scarfield: all the cool kids has one
 Astrobytes: I look like a metal hippie
 emh: I don't have a cat though. it would be hypocritical
 emh: Astrobytes really? do you get all the girls?
 Astrobytes: not made of metal, metal as in the music
 Scarfield: xD
 emh: I had a metal rock star looking guy visiting me and random girls walked up to him and kissed him in the bar
 emh: then he wanted to borrow my bed when he took the girl home. alas I couldn't agree with his proposition
 Scarfield: from now on i will picture you as a terminater
 Astrobytes: only hippie chicks from Europe tbh
 Astrobytes: lol emh, that seldom happens to me
 emh: seldom is better than never
 MSmits: “ Code with me if you want to live.”
 emh: hehehe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need to learn korean or mandarin, these subtitles r killing me
 Astrobytes: well, these days it never happens tbh
 Scarfield: xD smits
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 emh: I'm 37. I'm in my prime
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: that is a prime number
 emh: you got it
 Astrobytes: hah
 emh: the best ages are power of two though
 Scarfield: im 32 :muscle:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My dad turned 74 yesterday and gets more cat than i do. :cry:
 emh: nice. enjoy
 Astrobytes: 1 year til my next prime
 MSmits: more cat?
 Astrobytes: fking 40 this year
 PatrickMcGinnisII: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Astrobytes: read between the lines MSmits
 emh: hope I will reach the age of an 128-bit SSE instruction. not really. I'm content with x64
 MSmits: what do you do with your pets over there PatrickMcGinnisII,  do i want to know
 emh: we recycle polyethylenes here
 Astrobytes: I figure the less time I have to spend being old on this godforsaken planet the better. 64-76 suits me fine
 therealbeef: 2 more months until the answer to live the universe and everything
 therealbeef: life
 Astrobytes: we *make* polyethylene in my town emh
 emh: but I'm really rooting for AGI. want to live to see it
 emh: Astrobytes ohh you make my Turkish pepper bottles then haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: How r coders gonna fix the next great depression?  And who is gonna deliver our pizzas?
 Astrobytes: Ineos. They make most of the shit that fks up the planet :D

 MSmits: lol
 antiwonto: [auto] 'CSB' was defined as ' Coders Strikes Back (aka Mad Pod Racing) '
 StevenV: coc
 therealbeef: what does Ineos actually do? only know them from cycling team
 emh: PatrickMcGinnisII fixing depression is all about using multiply and add in the same instruction and stay away from subtraction
 emh: pizzas will be delivered by drones
 struct: are they not delivered in drones where you live?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3000 cows died of heatstroke in Kansas ... it's beginning
 MSmits: summer?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they closed yellowstone due to excessive rain, and cows die in midwest for lack of shade... the world is upside-down
 MSmits: I like stranger things
 jacek: or it is australia
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll move to AU, then things will b normal...ok
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: chemical manufacturing/processing and PetroIneos does what you might expect, oil refinery. We are lucky enough to have both in my town&#160;:|
 MSmits: if you move one astronomical unit you'll be in the sun, that's even hotter PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: this astrophysically correct joke was brought to you by...
 emh: struct not yet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Now we live in Monty Python movie
 emh: a giant foot stomps you
 Astrobytes: which one?

 Astrobytes: Yes, that's fair PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: I am confused about a replay. On frame 113 I do training. I obviously have more cards to play, yet I release on the next. Why am i not forced to WAIT or play another card.

 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits comment about this message brought to you by... reminded me of Monty P for some reason
 Astrobytes: "Incontinentia Buttocks" :D
 emh: classic
 Scarfield: and now for something completely different
 Astrobytes: I even get the theme in my head when you say that
 MSmits: my replay&#160;:)
 Scarfield: yea that movie is great&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I have no idea MSmits
 kovi: MSmits issue already reported
 MSmits: oh, what is the issue?
 MSmits: it just doesn't give extra plays?
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: ^ meaning "yes, what is the issue"
 kovi: there was no official answer of this :weidness"
 MSmits: does it always happen? Or sometimes happen?
 Astrobytes: must be still looking into it I guess
 kovi: for me it seemed too often, but i was lazy to investigate further
 MSmits: ok well it is good to know that it got reported
 The_Duck: in this replay <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642441539">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642441539</a> I seem to only draw 3 cards on turn 45, instead of 4. Or rather based on my logging, I think I draw 4, but the BONUS card I draw is invisible? is this a viewer bug?
 struct: I saw this bug before with my bot too The_Duck let me see if I can reproduce it
 Astrobytes: ah it's The_Duck&#160;:)
 The_Duck: hi!
 Astrobytes: If your logging says that after that you got the card then it must be a visualisation thing
 struct: Hand: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1]

 emh: New York The_Duck. do you know anyone from Theta Chi fraternity in Boston?
 struct: you can reproduce by just printing random
 struct: if you want to check
 Astrobytes: interesting. I don't pay much attention to the viewer this time around tbh
 emh: ohhh lo and behold I'm top dog again thanks for boosting me up hehe I did almost no coding all day
 emh: last submit about 8 hours ago
 MSmits: grats emh
 emh: the trick is to know when you're just gonna eff up your code by doing more
 emh: thank you MSmits
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl if you are still around. Did you limit your trainings? I time out every time i allow unlimited trainings
 Astrobytes: didn't he say he only allowed one or didn't include it?
 MSmits: not sure, he said he thought he could handle multiple trainings, but he didnt say his current bot has it
 Astrobytes: ah, must be thinking of that
 MSmits: I may have a bug though
 MSmits: brb
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: didn't limit but still have bugs
 TobiasA: sorry I don't really understand the game yet. So when you guys say "trainings" does it have something to do with the training skill in the game or NN training?
 eulerscheZahl: not generating all move sequences
 struct: training skills
 Astrobytes: in the game TobiasA
 struct: Unless its jacek saying
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 TobiasA: oh ok thanks
 jacek: training?
 MSmits: ahh ok thanks for explaining, i think i have bug, otherwise i dont understand how 3 training cards end up inmy played pile when i only have 1 and 1 in draw
 struct: Time to code undoAction
 jacek: just copy your states. ezpz
 struct: my states are big&#160;:/
 jacek: thats what she said :smirk:
 Astrobytes: Never change jacek, never change
 emh: United States of Murica. lol. no
 emh: I'm watching a baby shower getting drunk with hot girls on twitch. trash TV?
 struct: But you are right ill never code undo move for this game
 struct: if coding apply move is hard I cant imagine how hard it will be to undo
 Astrobytes: emh: why not just skip to the pr0n?
 emh: Astrobytes that's reserved for CSB
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 jacek: hm?
 emh: jacek is it time we invite you to the palace of pleasure?
 jacek: eeyup
 Murat_Eroglu: Am I the only one who thinks that this contest is more complicated than previous ones?
 Astrobytes: No&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Not necessarily more *complicated*, more of a confusing, or less understandable&#160;:)
 Scarfield: and more buggy it seems from chat, i still havent really gotten motivated to try
 Astrobytes: some bugs, but that's usual
 struct: I think its fun
 struct: I havent anything working yet but thats a different story
 Astrobytes: I like the game itself
 jacek: do you plan to buy it
 Astrobytes: No
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 jacek: oh my, dat csb
 Arthur_Morgan_RDR2: :apple:
 Astrobytes: jacek: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: It's certainly 'different' :D
 Arthur_Morgan_RDR2: Anyone played Red dead redemption 2 here?
 Arthur_Morgan_RDR2: Just completed the game yesterday
 Arthur_Morgan_RDR2: Definitely the best game i've ever played 
 eulerscheZahl: when i use a card for a skill, can't i use it again for release in the same turn?
 struct: Heard about it never played it
 struct: Dont think so euler
 struct: they go into played cards pile
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: at least that's what I understood
 struct: But if you get a card from using a skill then you can use it
 Astrobytes: yep
 struct: At least the canBeReleased function is not checking played cards
 struct: So I think what we said is correct
 Astrobytes: It's confusing isn't it, but that's what I understood earlier
 struct: and my asserts would have triggered by now
 Astrobytes: lol, got a bunch of those too :D
 Astrobytes: to hell with unit tests, long live assert
 eulerscheZahl: fixing bugs improves the rank. at least that early in the contest, before desperation kicks in
 Astrobytes: desperation == any sim will do
 jacek: what bugs? yours or theirs?
 Astrobytes: at this stage possibly a heady mix of both :D
 eulerscheZahl: me failing to replicate theirs? :P
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 emh: jacek was invited into the inner circle, but he's quiet about it
 jacek: im training NN for it
 emh: ahh right
 eulerscheZahl: what inner circle?
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: the transparent area inside the green one?
 jacek: tell him
 FuriousTurtle: For some reason, I have enough cards in my hand to release, I do the output command to release, but the game disqualify me for not having enough card . The cost is 4 daily + 4 refactoring, my hand is 4 bonus cards + 1 task priorization card + 2 coding cards
 jacek: is it 5th app?
 FuriousTurtle: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: no shoddy on 5th
 struct: cant use shoddy
 eulerscheZahl: that would be shady
 MSmits: and sloppy
 FuriousTurtle: I'm in wood 1, this rule doesn't apply yet right&#160;?
 MSmits: it does
 eulerscheZahl: it does
 jacek: per statement
 jacek: but i dont blame you for not believing it
 Giyom: no shoddy only apply since bronze not wood
 FuriousTurtle: I'm sorry I really don't see it in the rules for some reasons&#160;?
 jacek: "The 5th application of each team cannot be released with shoddy skills!". at least in bronze
 eulerscheZahl: just trust us in this case
 Giyom: yes in bronze but he is on wood league 
 FuriousTurtle: Also is there a cap on the maximum technical debt you can have&#160;? I see a red gauge but nothing about it in the rules
 struct: 100
 jacek: its use in tie break
 FuriousTurtle: Then this wasn't the issue either, I'm still unable to find out why my application made me disqualified, and it happens a couple of times
 struct: are you sure you didnt use shoddy points?
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: regarding the earlier emh comment, jacek has now 'experienced' the True CSB
 FuriousTurtle: I did use shoddy points but I'm in wood 1 and there's nothing about not using them on the final application
 struct: There is
 struct: Just maybe not on the statement
 struct: But i think it is
 FuriousTurtle: Omg nevermind it's in a non-highlighted part 
 FuriousTurtle: Starting from bronze it's highlighted in technical details through
 emh: Astrobytes damn right
 eulerscheZahl: did i miss a meme?
 eulerscheZahl: aaah, NSFW CSB
 MSmits: or it's new name, Mad P**** Racing
 MSmits: its
 emh: I love it how you're a respectable physics teacher MSmits and you're engaging with my lowlife jokes haha
 eulerscheZahl: *Riding
 MSmits: yes, well I have to be careful in case students are online&#160;:)

 jacek: onboarding?
 Astrobytes: lol @ eulerscheZahl's "riding" correction :D
 struct: if dist_1 &lt; dist_2
 TheInvisibleMutant_7f19: thx
 jacek: how come youre 3 level if not done onboarding oO
 emh: I love boasting to every non-programmer that I'm 139th out of 3 million programmers on codingame. call me vain
 emh: of course I don't say how much time I put into it
 jacek: Automaton2000 is that right?
 Automaton2000: i think the problem is that if you are a mod
 emh: Automaton2000 who let the dogs out?
 Automaton2000: hi i am new to this site
 emh: Automaton2000 you're a liar
 Automaton2000: this is where i am
 emh: Automaton2000 aren't you ashamed of yourself?
 Automaton2000: i already know how to create a private clash
 jacek: oh my
 emh: Automaton2000 all right have fun with your private clash
 Automaton2000: i have a bit of a stretch
 emh: Automaton2000 do you need a massage?
 Automaton2000: so if i am wrong
 Westicles: Whatever happened to wonton?  He was modding the hell out of the place for a while
 jacek: :taco: Westicles
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Westicles 7 tacos. Westicles now has 98 taco. jacek now has 8 taco
 emh: :taco: jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] emh has awarded jacek 3 tacos. jacek now has 11 taco. emh now has 4 taco
 struct: he was here just 2 days ago
 struct: Maybe he is still reading the statement
 Westicles: :taco: BlaiseEbuth
 antiwonto: [auto] Spread the love.  Give tacos to someone else, not someone you spam with tacos.
 Westicles: :taco: jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] Westicles has awarded jacek 10 tacos. jacek now has 21 taco. Westicles now has 99 taco
 emh: and here I thought it's a give and take. what am I gonna eat for dinner?
 eulerscheZahl: you are not French, i'm save
 emh: huh?
 jacek: omelette du fromage!
 emh: now gift it
 jacek: :egg:
 emh: you gotta break one.. to make an omelette
 Astrobytes: :taco: eulerscheZahl
 antiwonto: [auto] Astrobytes has awarded eulerscheZahl 10 tacos. eulerscheZahl now has 59 taco. Astrobytes now has 46 taco
 Astrobytes: I know you love the tacos
 emh: commander taco, wasn't that the editor of slashdot
 emh: any relation?
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: Astrobytes
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has awarded Astrobytes 10 tacos. Astrobytes now has 56 taco. eulerscheZahl now has 50 taco
 eulerscheZahl: since when do i lose while giving? meh
 jacek: i shook you down in #taco
 Astrobytes: I never understand taco bot
 eulerscheZahl: bots boring after a while anyways
 eulerscheZahl: gets boring
 eulerscheZahl: can't type
 Westicles: jacek shook you down
 Astrobytes: emh: I think you're right, no relation I believe
 Astrobytes: Must admit to never ever checking the taco channel
 Astrobytes: All this taco stuff is indirectly my fault anyway, so blame me
 eulerscheZahl: the comic of blaise is so on point
 Astrobytes: it was an instant classic
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/GCRAT3B.png">https://i.imgur.com/GCRAT3B.png</a>
 Astrobytes: LOL I never noticed the Westicles part :rofl:
 Westicles: user of the month!
 emh: hahaha
 emh: I want to compliment a girl. I'd say her polygons are so delicately textured
 Crosility: Man, I misunderstood the puzzle, and now I have to recreate all my dependency functions&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: emh: her normals and displacement maps are perfect
 struct: Just wait until you find you dont understand the game yet
 Crosility: Haha, struct, that's already happened multiple times.
 Crosility: Like the current contest. Card Games .. big nope for me.
 emh: Astrobytes even better. you've outdone me
 Westicles: kafkaesque contest
 eulerscheZahl: a colleague once tried to teach me Skat
 antiwonto: [auto] hey eulerscheZahl looking for some intro tutorials on programming?  This isn't the place probably.  Try codecademy.com , 'The Coding Train' on youtube, or first levels in codewars.com
 Astrobytes: emh: that's how I get the hippie chicks! (not)
 eulerscheZahl: thanks antiwonto, will do
 emh: Astrobytes stick to the whiskey
 Astrobytes: emh: *whisky
 Crosility: Lmao eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: that was when we arrived at the hotel (business trip) and i was already past bed-time
 emh: Astrobytes ahh that's right that's how you write it over there
 eulerscheZahl: he didn't get it, even after i blatantly told him that i'm about to fall asleep
 Astrobytes: Whiskey is either Irish or American
 Crosility: antiwonto -1
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Remi.: Is it a taco&#160;? (on the picture)
 emh: eulerscheZahl what happened on your bed-time?
 eulerscheZahl: right, it's about time
 eulerscheZahl: not my room is too warm
 eulerscheZahl: but my
 emh: I'm confused
 MSmits: I think this is cool. Maybe I fixed my bug
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642477662">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642477662</a>
 Astrobytes: #metoo
 MSmits: on frame 58 it thinks it has a 8% chance to win, then trains, then gets lucky and estimates at 28%, then gets lucky again and wins
 Astrobytes: euler, use a fan
 Astrobytes: or get a harem and they can fan you
 struct: nice MSmits
 MSmits: it's just not final move still
 eulerscheZahl: i have a fan. but not really colder outside
 MSmits: just on
 emh: what about the guy that wanted euler at bed time?
 eulerscheZahl: just replacing hot air with other hot air and annoying the cat with the sound of it
 Astrobytes: he didn't 'want' him emh, just wanted him to play cards!
 eulerscheZahl: no, i wanted to go to sleep as it was quite late
 emh: ahh ok
 emh: thought it was gay drama
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: for you everything is a porn, isn't it?
 struct: I dont want to see his STC version
 emh: I was speaking to my psychologist about that actually asked them if they have antiporn medicine
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: no top covering bedsheets night then
 eulerscheZahl: Alan Turing got some medicine, totally broke him
 emh: oh noes
 emh: I saw that movie
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl on c++ debug mode (no pragma) it does max 3 cards played in the play phase, I crash on 4 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that was some hardcore fail on society and humanity at large.
 emh: true
 MSmits: if i limit myself to 3, it is safe
 Westicles: he was buggering teens
 eulerscheZahl: no idea if i trigger cases with more cards
 eulerscheZahl: you need to have a training or coding card first, my bot doesn't want to collect them yet
 MSmits: maybe you just dont pick up many training cards, i have seen situations where there's 4 in my draw pile
 emh: oh wow i8fbnkyw I bow to you
 jacek: and I axe
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I believe they were of legal hetero 'age of consent'. Homosexuality was a crime in itself.
 Westicles: yeah, but not cool for an old guy to groom students
 emh: Rust even
 Astrobytes: Fair
 Astrobytes: emh: that the Japanese guy from atcoder and such?
 Astrobytes: IT is
 Astrobytes: nice
 emh: I don't know
 Astrobytes: hm, what are the best cards to give away?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/accounts/?search=i8fbnkyw">https://clist.by/accounts/?search=i8fbnkyw</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i don't know him
 emh: Astrobytes the one that is needed by the least amount of applications
 MSmits: give them coding cards Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: I saw his name before a few times
 Astrobytes: yeah, was just looking for a quick fix since I'm just idly coding things in the starter bot since I opened a beer earlier :D
 Astrobytes: not touching my real bot til tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: japanese, you can bet there's a twitter account<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/i8fbnkyw">https://twitter.com/i8fbnkyw</a>
 MSmits: enjoy the beer
 MSmits: emh, you're on twitter!!!
 MSmits: famous!!
 emh: lol
 Astrobytes: lol, tweeting about top bronze, that's gotta be a first
 Westicles: his tweets are compressed python
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: mmh people tweet what they had for dinner or if they had a difficult poo. I don't think it is so bad to tweet about this
 Astrobytes: "I'm doing it with Rust, which has a relatively small number of users, and I want to aim for the number one achievement in the language."
 MSmits: someone ping dbdr
 MSmits: oh i just did
 eulerscheZahl: i tried, he didn't see it
 Westicles: I don't think that achievement applies to events
 Astrobytes: lol, my first thought too
 emh: I'm hosting a young Asian girl tonight, she arrived this morning, but she's not very social, I mean a bit introvert
 Astrobytes: Westicles: I think it's more a personal thing for some users
 eulerscheZahl: we still have this discord server for out hashcode team. but he's rarely online to see when i like other stuff there
 eulerscheZahl: that couch surfing again emh?
 emh: yes
 Astrobytes: not around as much as he used to be tbh
 emh: I've hosted more than 1300 people
 Astrobytes: emh: not all at the same time I hope
 emh: max 13 at the same time
 Astrobytes: emh: also, DON'T show her the CSB
 eulerscheZahl: and you keep the pinky toe of all of them as a memory
 emh: Astrobytes yes I know
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: dexter-like
 emh: eulerscheZahl haha you get me
 emh: I love Dexter
 Astrobytes: well, in that case, show her the CSB :D
 jacek: and his laboratory?
 emh: hehe
 emh: I have a blood extraction lab in the basement for the vampires
 Astrobytes: jacek: I liked that cartoon more than the murdering DExter show tbh&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It got a bit stale after a while
 struct: There was also a new Dexter but not sure which show had the worst ending
 emh: how was the new Dexter? I didn't see it
 struct: not bad
 Astrobytes: American Psycho was good enough
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/10/96/7c109642593bcdc4daa8e14bfbd02f75.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/10/96/7c109642593bcdc4daa8e14bfbd02f75.jpg</a>
 struct: It's worth a watch
 struct: I just think that the ending was rushed
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 eulerscheZahl: no idea about the new one. but the ending was really disappointing for the original Dexter
 emh: I liked the scene about the cards they had in American Psycho
 Astrobytes: Always the way with most things these days struct
 eulerscheZahl: and the seasons felt long, i was happy whenever he got rid of his partners
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's what I mean when it was getting stale. Repetitive and just waiting
 eulerscheZahl: but not as bad as some netflix shows with the dozen sideplots that have nothing to do with the main story
 emh: that cop who was onto him was adrenaline building
 emh: I guess that was in the first few seasons
 eulerscheZahl: money heist is actually pretty cool. but i skip 50% of it
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I've still to catch up with Picard S2 and BCS
 emh: I've never watched Star Trek properly
 jacek: try the orville then
 emh: or anything of the sort
 eulerscheZahl: cold enough in my room now, good night
 emh: eulerscheZahl good night
 struct: yeap I cant watch start wars or star trek
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 emh: Illedan!
 Astrobytes: Start with TNG for series, film-wise, watch them all even if the early ones are cheesy
 Westicles: it is all SJW now
 emh: I stick to earth movies
 Astrobytes: I gave up on Star Wars when they did those horrible films with that creature in them
 emh: chewbacca? no the other one
 Westicles: they say obi-wan is relatively good
 Astrobytes: Jar Jar
 MSmits: “Mesa called Jar Jar Binks, mesa your humble servant!”
 emh: like a java pacakge
 Astrobytes: or whatever it was
 Astrobytes: yeah, should have remained compressed
 emh: hehe
 emh: zip it jar jar
 Astrobytes: Westicles: my nephew reckons it is, but he loves all of it
 Astrobytes: lol emh
 Westicles: emh took some pictures of the girls he hosted, but they aren't developed yet
 Astrobytes: OUCH
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: old Steve Martin joke
 Astrobytes: yeah it's a classic biter
 emh: I have a pretty good digital camera
 emh: it develops pretty fast
 Astrobytes: ^feigns ignorance :D
 emh: one girl wanted to sleep in my bed.. because it was more comfortable. and she watched 3D movies of a NSFW quality on my TV. then she let me take a picture of my tongue near her milk factory. then she undressed in my living room. but I didn't take the hint
 Westicles: you should meet Patrick
 Astrobytes: He has a sex swing
 Westicles: heh heh
 emh: but we held hands finally
 emh: does he?
 Astrobytes: Not asking for any more details there
 Astrobytes: Yes! Patrick is a kinky mofo
 jacek: mayonaisse guy?
 Astrobytes: I don't know his kinks lol
 emh: I'm gonna pretend you were writing about La Marseillase
 emh: I don't like mayonaisse
 emh: except when it's food
 jacek: i meant this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71GWS3ccmvI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71GWS3ccmvI</a>
 emh: hmm I didn't get the joke
 Astrobytes: I like it
 emh: actually I have sriracha mayo in my fridge
 jacek: you clicked my youtube link?
 Astrobytes: My spongebob memory is vague
 Astrobytes: It looked sufficiently different jacek and I have had some beer
 emh: jacek I clicked
 emh: I've only had 4 beers and 2 beers and 2 rum
 Astrobytes: Otherwise I wouldn't
 Astrobytes: moar rum emh
 emh: it's hard to gulp down
 emh: I'm not a professional drinker I'm a slow riser
 Astrobytes: no it isn't. Well, not if you're Scottish I guess.
 Astrobytes: Beer is easy to drink though, yes.
 emh: I sip shots I don't shot em
 emh: my specialty shot is vodka with balsamico vinegar
 Astrobytes: I shoot shots but I sip cocktails and &gt; shot_amount spirits
 Astrobytes: Never tried that. Sounds odd. Might need a dash of Worcestershire Sauce
 Astrobytes: and a touch of Tabasco
 Astrobytes: Possibly horseradish
 Astrobytes: Celery salt
 Astrobytes: but no tomato juice
 jacek: try nut vodka with milk
 Astrobytes: (we used to call that a Naked Mary)
 emh: jacek I have tried it. orzech lazkowy?
 jacek: eeyup!
 Astrobytes: jacek: the hazelnut stuff?
 jacek: eeyup
 Astrobytes: yeah that's lovely
 Westicles: give me 6 shots of johnny walker poured over a grapefruit
 Astrobytes: I can't have grapefruit
 Westicles: statins?
 emh: grapefruit is a multiplier for everything
 Astrobytes: 1. It's fking disgusting2. Interferes with most medications
 Astrobytes: (having worked in pharma related sht, it literally interacts with almost everything)
 emh: I love grapefruit. sometimes
 emh: I don't eat it very often, but I buy the juice occasionally
 emh: it's a bit sour for the stomach though
 emh: I take magnesium pills for sour stomach
 Astrobytes: Foul fruit. I'm on omeprazole cause I have to take a COX2-inhibitor
 Astrobytes: (NSAID)
 emh: ohh hmm
 Astrobytes: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory that is, if anyone is wondering
 emh: I used to be on aripiprazole, now I'm on cariprazine
 emh: against schizo
 emh: I actually hosted one of the lead researchers or administrative guys or something in Hungary related to cariprazine and he was the one who recommended it to me
 emh: it's one of the newest medicines
 Astrobytes: Interesting. I have a friend who might benefit from that info
 Astrobytes: Aripiprazole has been the goto for a long while (don't mention quetiapine etc)
 emh: I used quetiapine as sleep medicine in addition
 emh: *use
 emh: but not regularly
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's alright. As main med high dose it's horrific stuff.
 emh: it does have some unpleasant side effects, but only when used without alcohol. haha
 Astrobytes: hahaha, also interesting
 Westicles: lol.  mind altering drugs and booze, and you are afraid of grapefruit
 emh: anyway it's better than not sleeping for 3 nights
 Astrobytes: No *I'm* afraid of grapefruit, not emh
 Westicles: you guys need to go on a 72 hour fast to cleanse all that out
 Astrobytes: Yes emh, that makes sense
 Westicles: get some stem cells going
 emh: I tried fasting on tomato juice, but I didn't survive for long
 Astrobytes: I only do that kind of thing when I take hallucino- I mean vital 24 hour health breaks!
 emh: my friend was really about fasting, he lost a lof okg
 Astrobytes: it's not a healthy way to lose weight tbh
 Astrobytes: *some* fasting in combo with other sht yeah
 Westicles: it is more about autophagy and BDNF
 emh: when wiping your own backend is a problem... and you still don't feel like losing weight. I ordered an apparatus from China for wiping, but it didn't appeal to me
 TINOUAINANI: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/642497579">https://www.codingame.com/replay/642497579</a>
 TINOUAINANI: in case of this ho win&#160;?
 emh: it's a tie
 Astrobytes: Westicles: that's very specific to ones body chemistry
 TINOUAINANI: ok thanks
 Astrobytes: emh: what was her name?
 Astrobytes: (kidding!!!)
 Westicles: ha
 emh: Astrobytes who?
 Astrobytes: emh the apparatus from China!
 putibuzu: what am I reading :D 
 emh: ehh.. she?
 emh: I don't get it. it's a wiping device
 emh: doesn't have a female denominator
 Astrobytes: lol, read between the lines here
 RIT: how does the daily routine buff work? do you get to choose which desk you take a card from?
 putibuzu: it basically increases your range to take cards
 RIT: so you'd pick up 3 instead of 1?
 Astrobytes: emh: imagine it was a couch surfing candidate
 emh: Astrobytes you make it sound so dirty
 emh: it's a wholesome sport
 putibuzu: no, if you play one of those you can pick up cards 1 desk away
 Astrobytes: :D
 putibuzu: instead of only the card from the space you are in
 RIT: but how do you tell the game which card you want?
 putibuzu: you can output MOVE 0 1
 RIT: ah ok thanks
 putibuzu: np
 emh: finally my reign is at an end. I've been knocked down from my high horse. 4th
 emh: 5th
 Astrobytes: Focus on making a MLPony CSB for jacek
 Astrobytes: he'll love it
 emh: ponies are doing machine learning?
 emh: ohhh
 emh: my little pony
 Astrobytes: He likes ponies, but incorporate as much MultiLayerPerceptron as possible I guess
 Astrobytes: You'll have to ask him for the names and stuff, not my scene
 emh: hmm sounds kinky
 emh: jacek do you really like ponies?
 Astrobytes: he does, no joke, and no shaming
 jacek: what else MLP is for
 jacek: and dont image google kinkie pie
 jacek: it all started with recurse disapproving my saying like "nopony" or "somepony"
 jacek: his disapproval glance is all i needed to keep going
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Love it. 
 Astrobytes: Not my thing but do what ya do and do it well is what I say.
 Astrobytes: "his disapproval glance" - reShade? :D
 Astrobytes: jacek, emh, think we killed the chat
 emh: Astrobytes let's keep it alive then
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: we are all still just googling pony related stuff. Give us some time lads
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 emh: Sharon approves
 MSmits: I did something ballsy that didnt pan out yet
 Astrobytes: Sharon is the guest? Or another demon emh?
 MSmits: i took my endgame solver and just templated it into my normal move sim, now it crashes and i dont know why :P
 emh: Astrobytes the guest
 Astrobytes: :D
 emh: although she doesn't know what my little pony is
 Astrobytes: MSmits: interesting, perhaps it is because it is considering the endgame
 MSmits: she probably thought it was your nickname for your, you know what
 emh: MSmits hahhahaha I doubt it
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: almost choked on my beer
 MSmits: he told her: "We are talking about my little pony on chat"
 MSmits: "some guy is obsessed with it"
 Astrobytes: Quit projecting MSmits
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol, chat hasn't been this lewd in a long time
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: guess we need to make the most of it since it will soon be gone
 MSmits: or we will, if wontonimo logs in and sees it
 MSmits: i'll blame emh
 MSmits: he's the worst
 Astrobytes: I have a sneaking suspicion he would see the funny side
 Astrobytes: lol poor emh, he is but a humble purveyor of CSB alternatives
 MSmits: true
 emh: omg I'm the scapegoat
 emh: wontonimo willl ban me
 Astrobytes: and tbh, most of the chat is risqué references/suggestive things with a couple of double entendres 
 Astrobytes: I rescued you emh
 emh: ok wow thank you
 Astrobytes: MSmits: so what about your solver? I mean, plugging an endgame solver into your main game logic from the start isn't ideal is it
 MSmits: well i was going to do it like this
 MSmits: i can use all the same items
 MSmits: so i send a boolean with the template
 MSmits: if true it does the eval at the end
 MSmits: if false it returns 1 or 0 for win
 MSmits: and if some playable cards are not needed to check for the win i can also use ifs for that
 MSmits: templated ifs are done at compile time so thats cool
 Astrobytes: alright, did you test this with non-templated methods
 MSmits: i already have 900 lines
 MSmits: i dont want to have 1600 lines
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: for functionality purposes. Because templated functions will not give you good feedback if they fail
 MSmits: yeah thats the annoying part
 MSmits: i forgot about that
 Astrobytes: ffs dude, I've had 5 Stellas and even I can see that issue :D
 MSmits: whats a Stella?
 Astrobytes: Stella Artois
 emh: beer
 Astrobytes: Beer
 jacek: keep the chat PG-13
 Astrobytes: it is!
 MSmits: yup so far it is
 MSmits: not much lower than that though
 Astrobytes: Stella as in women, never had one. Did A Christella (sp?) once, Greek.
 MSmits: I'm sorry you never had a woman Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Still PG-13
 Astrobytes: You read that wrong MSmits
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: It's ok you dont like women Astrobytes, dont worry about it
 Astrobytes: Now you're just playing dumb :P
 MSmits: I know&#160;:)
 MSmits: well my templatey stuff works, kinda
 avdg: The future of programming thrown away... common :p
 avdg: *come on
 Astrobytes: I'd advise testing the possible cases separately before templating MSmits
 MSmits: yeah, but it works, it just fails because my bot doesnt know what to do when there's 4 apps done
 Astrobytes: oh hey avdg, playing the contest?
 avdg: yeah but not with lots of time
 avdg: and with rust
 avdg: (I still have to master the language)
 avdg: but I can write code that can compile
 Astrobytes: MSmits hm, logic issue then
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: avdg: this is NOT the contest to practice on believe me
 avdg: well I don't have lots of time anyway
 Astrobytes: you normally use JS/TS right avdg?
 avdg: yep
 Astrobytes: Use that. It's complicated enough as it is without trying to learn another lang on top of this mess :D
 Astrobytes: (the game I mean)
 avdg: meh, I don't have lots to gain by winning the game
 MSmits: you get a phone!!
 Astrobytes: even playing it will be a struggle, believe me
 Astrobytes: this is a "stick to what you know" and analyze the code like a forensic scientist game. Don't read the statement. Output first move given or something until Bronze.
 kouin: is there no GIVE_CARD phase in wood 1 league?
 struct: Not sure kouin
 MSmits: not sure, there isnt in wood 2
 struct: But if you want full statement
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/vhrIwYo.jpeg</a>
 Astrobytes: I was only there momentarily, not sure. I think it was just MOVE and RELEASE first 2 leagues no?
 MSmits: oh also, the phases only happen if you have a choice to make kouin. If you only have 1 card to give, there is no phase
 kouin: ok thanks MSmits, that was why
 MSmits: np
 kouin: that was it*
 MSmits: ohh sim bot is working i think. I forgot to multiply my TD penalty by the TD score constant. That made technical debt 300 x less important
 emh: did I mention I'm a wannabe game developer? I've got 3 games on steam, but the only one can vouch for is "Dance of Cubes"
 MSmits: you have 1 review, but it is very extensive
 emh: it's very strange
 MSmits: yeah
 emh: bot-like
 Astrobytes: And your full name is quite magnificent
 emh: thank you haha
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: you're the second most impressive magnus i know
 emh: only the second?
 emh: who is the first?
 MSmits: yes, if you become chess world champion too, you go up a rank
 emh: actually there's a Magnus Carlsen living in my building. probably not the same one though
 MSmits: yeah thats doubtful
 emh: could be he's got an extra apartment for visits to Bergen never know
 MSmits: true
 Astrobytes: Magnus is a pretty common name MSmits
 MSmits: yeah but i only kno 2
 avdg: it thinks me at ice cream tbh
 Astrobytes: Carlsen is also a very common surname
 emh: magnus means great
 Astrobytes: avdg that's a Magnum
 avdg: even so :p
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: (good taste btw, they are amazing)
 Westicles: .44 magnum?
 avdg: few weeks ago I learned that many ice creams are tested on crack strength, I guess it's done on magnum ice creams as well
 Astrobytes: crack strength? :D
 avdg: yeah
 avdg: with a meter that measure force
 avdg: (measuring what is needed to crack the outer cream)
 Astrobytes: I am dying hard in too many ways to reply properly
 Westicles: tastes better with meth
 Astrobytes: doesn't that just apply to the exterior coating though avdg?
 Astrobytes: e.g. the chocolate or whatever is on it
 avdg: not sure, the guy told that in taste, nothing is by accident
 emh: Westicles that's almost a permutation of my name
 avdg: probably the cream inside has strength tests as well
 Westicles: meh
 emh: hehe
 Astrobytes: Yes, stability measurements.
 emh: people love to permute me
 Astrobytes: Additives.
 Astrobytes: lol emh
 Astrobytes: avdg: as a chef, your ice cream is good if it sets, and starts to melt if it's out of the freezer. That's why you get it to the customer quickly. Ice cream confections you buy from a company are not quite the same.
 Astrobytes: Very different requirements. The strength test makes sense though.
 avdg: The experience is obviously different when the outer layer is kinda melted :P
 Westicles: I used to have to make it with one of those buckets with a crank
 Astrobytes: if the ice cream is inside a shell in a restaurant, you have a very specific kind of coating on it, similar to manufactured but not the same
 Sraiti: hey guys the batman game execute two actions in one turn is that normal&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Westicles just a whisk and some elbowgrease is enough
 Westicles: rock salt and ice everywhere
 Astrobytes: Sraiti: I guess you are printing 2 actions
 Sraiti:  i thought that the game skip to the next turn once it gets one action
 Astrobytes: Westicles :rofl:
 Astrobytes: yes Sraiti but just print one per iteration of the main while loop
 Astrobytes: or it will read that extra one too
 Sraiti: thanks i will try to see if i'm printing two actions in one iteration 
 Astrobytes: if you need to debug, print to stderr, otherwise actions go to stdout
 Sraiti: yah console.error in typescript 
 Illedan: Hi
 Astrobytes: yep
 Astrobytes: hey Ille
 struct: hi
 emh: good night
 struct: gn
 Illedan: gn
 MSmits: gn
 tablet: yo
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: gn!
 Astrobytes: oh I'm late
 Astrobytes: Illedan how's the hayfever
 struct: is that an allergy fever?
 Astrobytes: yeah, pollen
 Astrobytes: *pollen allergy
 Astrobytes: not really an actual fever, it's rhinitis 
 struct: I see
 Astrobytes: eyes, nose, mouth/throat, if you get pollen in there it's a living nightmare depending how bad your allergy is. I don't suffer myself but several members of my family do
 Astrobytes: brb
 Astrobytes: back
 struct: wb
 Astrobytes: man this game is just odd
 MSmits: yes
 aCat: ^^'
 struct: at least my bot is doing better than print action 0
 Astrobytes: same struct :D
 Astrobytes: aCat: locam is simpler!
 Astrobytes: at least it makes some sense lol
 struct: im not sure yet what data structures to use yet
 struct: im using vectors, arrays...
 aCat: Astrobytes :kissing_cat:
 Astrobytes: I have a bunch of vectors currently in my sim bot, easily replaced by my non-stl vector but  plain arrays are nice
 struct: I store discard, draw and played all in vector
 aCat: no bits&#160;:&gt;?
 struct: I think its too slow
 struct: Not yet
 Astrobytes: I just like the ease of sorting and all the other std algorithm functions on vecs
 Astrobytes: struct, I keep them all in one vector, but they have an attribute called Location
 struct: Maybe Ill use uint32_t for the 8 skills
 struct: it should fit
 struct: But I think I coded enough for the day
 Astrobytes: I need next week to be a thing so I can concentrate. I do too many other things on a weekend
 struct: Now I think I really understand the rules
 Astrobytes: Yes Joshua, the only winning move is not to play
 struct: Do you use bits aCat?
 Astrobytes: sorry, it was on tv an hour or 2 ago
 aCat: no
 struct: is that a reference to what?
 Astrobytes: Wargames
 aCat: I was thinking about it - better performance but I would do sim only partial
 aCat: and bits are worse for ifology;]
 struct: Well I can only do sim so there is that
 aCat: I only have bitset for available applications
 aCat: ok, I submitted my bunch of ifs
 Astrobytes: Ofc only partial sim but it's a bruteforce depth 1, anything after that you need to start guessing... 
 aCat: even not hardcoded opening 4 rules for full game
 struct: my submit is 100 iterations MC
 Astrobytes: I just add ifs to the starter code tonight, I work on the real bot when sober
 struct: hardcode opening?
 struct: is this a thing?
 Astrobytes: i have no idea
 aCat: (this cat said nothing :P)
 aCat: (secret remains secret&#160;;])
 struct: hmm
 struct: Im not gonna hardcode anyways
 struct: tomorrow I rewrite my sim again
 struct: only third time not bad
 Astrobytes: writing (part of) my sim gave me at least an understanding of the game, roughly
 struct: yeah
 struct: Now I know the rules and which parts I can improve the sim on
 Astrobytes: now it's trying to do that efficiently
 Astrobytes: yeah exactly
 Astrobytes: Top 20 is still interesting language-wise, lots to be said for heuristics here at least at the moment, I think that may change in Silver
 Scarfield: when probability enters the game, i think it will be the high performance languages, at least i think
 Astrobytes: and we still are waiting for Karang to crack the RandomInt
 Scarfield: that would be crazy in this game
 struct: There is no excuse for the random to be cracked this time
 Scarfield: way more powerful than the previous contest
 avdg: There is no referee released?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle">https://github.com/societe-generale/GreenCircle</a>
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: good point. And yeah, it's a lot harder with an int though
 struct: I don't think it's possible to crack random here
 Astrobytes: struct: did they fix the not SecureRandom thing?
 struct: SDK has it
 struct: and I think it works
 struct: but this referee doesnt use it
 Astrobytes: yeah exactly
 struct: It might use the version but it still uses normal Random
 Astrobytes: That's why we called on Karang
 Astrobytes: Int is hard af compared to the floats though
 struct: and you dont have opponent info
 Astrobytes: He was at least willing to try but not sure if he gave up or not
 struct: you dont know which cards he started with on his hand
 Scarfield: you only know the location of your opponent, never which cards used to release, or cards in their deck right?
 Astrobytes: not important if you only consider yours. Draw pile gets updated with randomly chosen cards from the discard pile remember,
 Scarfield: and you cant choose which cards to use when releasing?
 struct: you only know which cards he has 
 struct: and the automated
 struct: You dont know where they are at
 struct: But wouldnt you need the random from his as well to reverse it?
 Astrobytes: I'm not 100% on that
 Scarfield: oh you do get opponent cards
 Astrobytes: yeah you get the cards but not the location, other than automated or not
 Scarfield: didnt like this when it came out, realised today its actually interesting&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Interesting but very, very, VERY, did I say VERY yet? confusing :D
 Scarfield: yea, thats probably why i lacked the motivation to take a decent look at it. have to look through some probability notes from school&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Understand the game first, that's harder
 Scarfield: im still in wood 2 xD
 Astrobytes: print first action
 Scarfield: tried it, didnt get me anywhere
 struct: I was like rank 200 in bonze with that
 Astrobytes: wait a sec
 struct: But I was like one of the firsts to submit, so I was a pushed
 Scarfield: just submitted a first action again, but i doubt it will go anywhere sadly
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I think I sorted available moves by substring, not RANDOM, I may have done it with MOVE somehow, it was very simple
 Astrobytes: as in substring(0, 6)&#160;!= "RANDOM"
 Scarfield: im just gonna make some simple, if i lack one skill card in hand for an app, go there -&gt; release
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure it was MOVE or something that got me out of the woods
 Astrobytes: Wood 2 anyway, resubmitted in wood 1 with first action and it was fine, straight to bronze. The "RANDOM" in Wood2 is horrific, or was at least
 Scarfield: 339/374 with first action, about the same with random for me&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: gimme a minute or two
 struct: cant help you much Scarfield
 struct: My first AI submit was Monte carlo
 Scarfield: but i think this is gonna turn into a planning game of blocking your opponent from the cards needed to release the 5th app
 struct: and I had to code a sim for it&#160;:/
 Scarfield: np just gonna make some simple ifs, not tonight though
 MSmits: blocking opponent like that is not easy Scarfield, you dont know much of what he has, you cant completely block him and there's lots of playable cards to get around it
 Scarfield: yea im still in wood, so just guessing, but there definately is depth to this game i think
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yes, a lot
 struct: tomorrow Ill try your thing MSmits
 struct: the&#160;% to end game
 Astrobytes: Or at least more than it seemed at the start
 struct: Do you just brute force all possible combos?
 Astrobytes: seems like the way to go
 Astrobytes: you can prune silly stuff I think, can you confirm MSmits?
 MSmits: i guess so
 Astrobytes: mind you, in this game it's hard to judge what is silly at what time sometimes
 MSmits: i dont prune
 MSmits: struct i do bruteforce but i limit playable cards to 3 in a turn
 MSmits: so you cant play 4 cards in my sim currently
 struct: thats how you calculate the&#160;% like that?
 struct: sry for the english
 Scarfield: you know opponents debt, what they released since last turn, and which cards they have, that should be enough to get a rough idea of their cards no?
 struct: im too tired lol
 MSmits: I calculate probability when you draw cards
 Astrobytes: your english is perfect struct, shut up&#160;:)
 MSmits: and i pick the highest probability score when there's a choice to be made
 MSmits: drawing cards only happens on training and coding so it's not that hard
 MSmits: 2 or 1 card
 struct: I see
 struct: Thanks, tomorrow I should try it
 Astrobytes: In combo with all the info given yes Scarfield, track it carefully tho
 MSmits: it's simple high school probability calculus btw, nothing weird
 Scarfield: im not going into that untill i get bronce, just realised that the info should be there
 struct: Yeah isnt it just based on the cards remaining on draw pile?
 MSmits: draw, but with some exceptions for when its empty or nearly empty
 MSmits: you need to reshuffle the discard
 MSmits: into draw
 struct: I see
 Astrobytes: but you can bruteforce that too
 MSmits: the shuffling is easy
 Scarfield: how does that work btw, it seemed there was a bug if you had &lt;4 cards in draw pile?
 MSmits: just memcpy the discard into the draw and do the same thing you were going to do if you didnt have to shuffle
 Astrobytes: yes MSmits, exactly
 Astrobytes: I wrote this earlier
 Astrobytes: in my sim
 MSmits: ohh ok
 struct: what data structure do you use for discard and draw pile MSmits? Anything fancy?
 Scarfield: no i mean in the game, do your discard pile get shuffled into the draw pile as soon as there are less than 4 cards in the draw pile?
 Astrobytes: I started at a random place in my sim but it makes sense to me. I have all teh methods laid out
 struct: no when it reaches 0 Scarfield
 Astrobytes: Scarfield, only at 0
 Scarfield: so you can draw less than 4 cards, and thats intended or a bug you know=
 MSmits: no, i use a crappy int[10] for now
 Astrobytes: drawCount == 0 &amp;&amp; discard == 0 return false or something, for drawing
 Astrobytes: thereafter it pushes discard pile cards to draw
 Scarfield: aah ok
 Scarfield: 3 cards in draw pile, they for certain are drawn, then one from discard pile (since they all get shuffled into draw)&#160;?
 MSmits: I was wondering why my bot would not finish app 5, then i noticed architecture is not an available card to play in my sim
 MSmits: architecture is super important for the last app
 Astrobytes: Yeah Scarfield, it'll shuffle them all in
 Scarfield: okay ty, i wonder why they specify in the rules you have to move one way, when you can still move where ever you want xD
 Astrobytes: oh wait, it does that on empty
 Astrobytes: hang on a sec
 MSmits: you are penalized when going from 7 to 0 Scarfield
 MSmits: moving through admin desk
 MSmits: (in bronze)
 Scarfield: oh, is the statement more clear in bronze?
 Astrobytes: ah no, I am right, I neglected to see the looping through the number of cards to draw.
 MSmits: Scarfield no
 MSmits: there's just more statement
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: And yeah, no
 Astrobytes: Worse, tbh
 Astrobytes: Trust the code and chat
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/2CukM4Eoi7Q?t=25">https://youtu.be/2CukM4Eoi7Q?t=25</a>
 Astrobytes: lol, that's a thing in North London too :D
 Astrobytes: Yeah yeah no, Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah no
 Scarfield: lol

 Astrobytes: Sadly, that actress died a few years back
 Astrobytes: It takes talent to act that stupid!
 Scarfield: haha yea&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *Why not hy
 Astrobytes: Last one, best of Alice:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CBZSvdx11c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CBZSvdx11c</a>
 Scarfield: my ifs seem to work&#160;:)
 Scarfield: "call me alice"
 Astrobytes: did you work with my recommendations?
 MSmits: yay 9 out of 10 first games won
 Scarfield: tried a few combinations, but decided to finish my approach instead, it was almost there
 struct: nice
 MSmits: think i finally got the bugs out, well most of them
 MSmits: hope this gets top 100
 Scarfield: there is always one more bug :p
 struct: it should
 MSmits: yeah seems like it
 MSmits: i definitely went overbudget with my coding time today&#160;:)
 struct: are you running any book while coding?
 MSmits: yeah i am still trying to solve oware
 struct: :D
 MSmits: after contest i will write some code to clean my meta mcts from all but the necessary proving nodes. That way i wont hit the limit of 2 billion nodes and can keep solving
 Astrobytes: Are you and jacek still gonna team up for the Oware thing?
 MSmits: I don't think so, but I'll help him if he needs help
 Astrobytes: Cause when I saw that I just quit lol
 MSmits: Oh btw, if you want to see what i look like, Professor x also put my picture up
 MSmits: i figured that world champion he beat also had a picture 
 Scarfield: just got the wood 1 rules, damn architecture seems op
 MSmits: it's needed
 Astrobytes: If you want to know what I look like just ask lol
 MSmits: but not for app 1-4
 Scarfield: yea seems that would be a waste
 MSmits: first thing i am going to do tomorrow is make this mess readable. 
 MSmits: I am talking about my code btw, not the statement
 Astrobytes: link for your pic MSmits?
 MSmits: sec
 Astrobytes: I bet this is a troll
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://48stones.com/research-games-challenge/">https://48stones.com/research-games-challenge/</a>
 MSmits: no troll
 Scarfield: i prefer to think of you with that white hair xD
 Astrobytes: No troll indeed, you look much younger than you feel
 struct: you look dutch 
 Astrobytes: lol that too
 MSmits: well thanks I guess&#160;:)
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: at least i dont think of you like a cat
 Scarfield: playing the keyboard that is 
 MSmits: no please don't
 Astrobytes: since we're on that subject: does this link work?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yt3.ggpht.com/USdMksM7jDWstOf2sZ8w2Vo7QcfCqRNxrRYUctMAsDDTVL2QP5cfm4BEdo1ZxudRbtXpp21RdQ=s480-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj">https://yt3.ggpht.com/USdMksM7jDWstOf2sZ8w2Vo7QcfCqRNxrRYUctMAsDDTVL2QP5cfm4BEdo1ZxudRbtXpp21RdQ=s480-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj</a>
 MSmits: yep, is that you?
 Astrobytes: Yup
 MSmits: awesome
 MSmits: like you're in a rock band
 Astrobytes: on a good day a few months ago
 MSmits: my uncle that worked at IBM his whole life looked like you
 Scarfield: but you are not made of metal
 Astrobytes: Ah Scarfield, the beard. When it grows I just look metal
 Scarfield: xD
 MSmits: ended up 61th on this submit. Was 180th without sim
 Scarfield: you look pretty metal right there&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: MSmits: the weed growing one?
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Scarfield: lol
 struct: What search are you using? Random?
 Astrobytes: I think my tshirt says all I need to say about that
 MSmits: brute force, same as euler
 MSmits: yep
 struct: I dont think I can run brute force yet
 MSmits: i still have to put in daily routines card
 MSmits: my bot cant use it
 Scarfield: i made a new algorithm. its not a search or force, its just brute and dumb
 struct: How do you choose which cards you take from the deck MSmits?
 struct: Random?
 Astrobytes: brutus search
 MSmits: take from the deck?
 MSmits: you mean drawing?
 struct: draw pile yeah sry
 MSmits: I don't choose
 Astrobytes: you should brute that
 MSmits: I draw all
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: weighted average by probability
 struct: But create a different state for each draw right?
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: nice to know I was going in the right direction&#160;:)
 struct: Makes sense, I will probably try to brute force tomorrow
 struct: For now I'm going to rest
 struct: Gn every1
 MSmits: me too. GN guys
 Astrobytes: gn struct
 Astrobytes: night MSmits
 Astrobytes: I'll probably f off too
 Scarfield: i have a feeling there is an approach here, where you search to maximize your probability to draw what you want, not the other way around
 Scarfield: yea me too&#160;:) gn folks
 Astrobytes: interesting point Scarfield
 Scarfield: yup&#160;:) but gn its getting way too late
 DaNinja: do you need an int[10] for permanent cards?
 DaNinja: totally forgot about them
 Westicles: looks like only about 200 people max are actually trying on the contest?  I'm 250 with a garbage submit
 j4at: I'm 243th with pritning first possible action :grimacing:
 Westicles: yeah, same here
 Westicles: so I think anyone who has basically anything real should make silver
 BrunoFelthes: in general, basic AIs can get GOLD, the real challenge is reach legend
 square1001: I can't predict how the silver/gold/legend cutoffs will be, though... Only a few (or none) are reaching gold by now?
 DaNinja: they select a boss from the submitted AIs to let a percentage of bots promote to the next league
 DaNinja: if I remember correctly, last challenge 500 bots got into legend when it opened
 DaNinja: which seemed like a lot
 Glyptod0n: sorry can anyone tell me what happens if the two player release the same application on the same turn
 DaNinja: first player gets the app. it is removed from the inputs for the next player
 saiko5: coding from airplane lol!
 DaNinja: really? :D
 saiko5: yeah
 saiko5: from JA339J
 saiko5: Osaka-&gt;Chitose(Hokkaido) Japan

 BleedingCatz: how do you get promoted in a league (specifically for the coders strike back game)? i've beaten the "Boss" but it won't promote me, do I need to click something or?
 ProCoder03: wait promotions only happen in some time intervals 
 BleedingCatz: ok so i just need to to "play my code" and then wait a bit?
 ProCoder03: hmmmmm... 
 ProCoder03: you need to wait 
 ProCoder03: your rank is still been calculated 
 ProCoder03: got to LeaderBoard  -&gt; change the score to computing to see your rank 
 BleedingCatz: yeah it shows me above the Boss
 BleedingCatz: i will just wait, eventually it will promote me hahah
 ProCoder03: yeah

 LittleFlea: of course. i am actually doing the same one
 Prof.Moriarty: Cool, because I am stuck on it, I manage to get the first 2 right, but have no ideia how to keep on the rest 
 LittleFlea: you mean choosing the positive one if there are two answer with the same number
 Prof.Moriarty: Yes
 LittleFlea: probably where they want the lambda expression they are talking about in the description IMO
 Prof.Moriarty: It make sense

 howdoyoulive: hey, anyone how the coders strike back computes the dist, I am really confused when I want to use it in condition
 eulerscheZahl: you have to compute it yourself. you know where you are and where the checkpoint is
 eulerscheZahl: there's an old Greek called Pythagoras
 juice0: he's even older than euler
 ProCoder03: @howdoyoulive, what league are you in&#160;??
 ProCoder03: bcoz till bronze or silver , they give us the distance as input 
 howdoyoulive: bronze now lol,

 TimothyAlexisVass: hello
 Tom_Brown: Timothy what types on questions did you take, are they similar to the coc questions or easier or harder??
 Not-Naman: stonks
 Bthix: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 TimothyAlexisVass: What's coc questions?
 RightHandElf: I think he means clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: is this "better than 99%" even based on real results? or is full points = 99%?
 eulerscheZahl: and i just realized that i reply to a message from 4h ago
 TimothyAlexisVass: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 TimothyAlexisVass: There are over 200K on this site, perhaps it's compared to all of those somehow.
 eulerscheZahl: most didn't even take this test, so that would be possible. but give that 99% for pretty much any result
 eulerscheZahl: btw there are &gt; 2 million registered users
 derjack: so 5% is 100k users
 Astrobytes: *the* 5% was 5% of survey respondents. 
 Skinjbir: test
 Astrobytes: failed
 Wontonimo: plz try and use the words "clash" or "CoC" with caps.  Without caps just invites poor behaviour and responses
 eulerscheZahl: right, there were 200k users who brought us into that mess of less contests
 ZeroMemory: hahahahahaah
 derjack: who wants to be a clash of code king
 Westicles: Wontonimo, you should add that to the FAQ along with the minimum IQ requirement
 michaellan: I want to be a clash of code king
 Not-Naman: then you must prepare for war
 Not-Naman: I mean you must prepare to be expert in clashcode
 Aidan1233456: how to past test 1?
 Endless_void: lol
 Endless_void: im in school
 Q12: Hey  eulerscheZahl, you said you had a problem with the auto publish in puzzles you solve, like ADVERSARIAL MATE WITH ROOK did the problem has been solved?
 Q12: I am asking because I can see my published code
 Westicles: Published in the last month?
 Q12: yes
 Westicles: which one?

 Westicles: Kepe55, you'll figure it out
 Westicles: One of those homilies from that Rwandan guy would help about now.
 Kepe55: Can someone just give me a hint, I don't really get what's wrong
 Westicles: w is missing from your alphabet?
 Kepe55: oops
 Kepe55: test cases 4 and 6 still not working, now that I added w
 Kepe55: Now my score has gone up to 80% though!
 Kepe55: Test case 4 and 5 are not working when I submit, "Test AB!!CD" and Test Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,...
 TimothyAlexisVass: You have to write&#160;? for characters outside the alphabet
 TimothyAlexisVass: such as the '@' and the ' '
 Kepe55: oh
 Kepe55: thanks, I will try to implement that
 TimothyAlexisVass: You could do a replacement in the string for anything which is not in your alphabet string...

 Kepe55: oh
 Kepe55: No but I think it has to be that way because in Test 6 they give you "MAN HAT TAN"

 Kepe55: I see now, thank you!!
 Kepe55: When reading other's solutions on this one I feel like they are much more complicated than mine
 TimothyAlexisVass: :D
 TimothyAlexisVass: Sometimes, more code and simpler logic is better. But when you're playing a lot of Clash, you kind of get into the "write it short and fast" mode&#160;;)

 <b>**Astrobytes is afk again</b></p><p><img src="/a/54970169109216" /> Wontonimo: echo hello | ruby_program
 TimothyAlexisVass: compared to input() in Python and readline() in JavaScript
 TimothyAlexisVass: What's the shortest way in Ruby?
 Wontonimo: ah, golfing.  idk
 Jon...: *$&lt; will read all lines of input
 TimothyAlexisVass: and 1 line?
 BlaiseEbuth: gets
 Jon...: Into an array I think if you. So for example if you had one line with a value, and then n additional lines, you could do `n,*l=*$&lt;`
 Jon...: Also I've seen `dd`.eval, not super familiar with how that works though
 Jon...: I think *$&lt; Still has new line characters, but if you do `dd`.split it removes newlines
 Jon...: I means `dd`.split not eval sorry
 Jon...: I think? Still learning
 TimothyAlexisVass: oh
 Link_jon: .. huh this seems new. (btw what language is that?)
 Jon...: Ruby
 TimothyAlexisVass: Thank you Jon and Blaise
 Jon...: It saves a ton of space on multiline problems vs languages like JS where you have to read one line at a time
 TimothyAlexisVass: in JS you can do this:for((r=readline)(a=[]);s=r();)a.push(s)
 TimothyAlexisVass: to read all strings into array a
 Jon...: Nice
 TimothyAlexisVass: all lines as strings*
 Link_jon: Yeah...  im.. very odd in the fact my favourite language is Lua.
 Link_jon: Basically something very simalar to JS and Python
 TimothyAlexisVass: I've used Lua with Roblox. It's kinda nice.
 Link_jon: yeah.. oddly enough, i didnt know roblox used it for the longest time.  i allways messed around with it in Computercraft (minecraft mod)Also, i have seen a decent number of very very bad habits roblox lua generates.
 jacek: oO
 Link_jon: sadly, i dont remember what they are exactly, nor can i find it
 Link_jon: i just remember roblox lua has tendancies to teach people things that.. if you use in standard lua, kills it
 theapp: what mean 4 on Example 1
 BlaiseEbuth: 4
 TobiasA: 5
 Link_jon: Actually from my small amount of research, (ie poking in google a bit)Garrys mod does the same thing.
 BlaiseEbuth: 4 doesn't mean 5 you fool -_-
 TobiasA: 4==5(-1)
 RightHandElf: def 5(i): return -4*i
 Link_jon: ... no? that would be 4 == 5 * (-1)..? ehh. idk.
 TobiasA: 1==2 ==&gt; 4==5
 Westicles: algebraic over algebraic is algebraic
 TobiasA: 1==2 =&gt; false
 TobiasA: 4==5 =&gt; false
 TobiasA: 1=4
 TobiasA: 2=5
 TobiasA: :nerd:
 MSmits: true == false returns false, which means it's true.
 MSmits: it's true that it's false I mean

 Astrobytes: Easier on paper
 Maxim251: Hm.. But problem is that In pc I can move functions freelly, on paper I will make mess after I start corecting everything, or try add something on another place
 Maxim251: Just I want know if I can desighn code structure befor I start actually code.
 JipFr: Why did they remove the spread operator in JS?
 michaellan: they didnt?
 michaellan: backwards compatibility is a big deal
 michaellan: you're probably experiencing some syntax error
 michaellan: I wonder how MCTS/minimax works in Tron, for opponents moves
 michaellan: randomly turning every second seems like an incorrect strategy for playouts
 michaellan: and a fixed-depth minimax (with an eval function somehow) doesnt sound very feasaible
 michaellan: dang, Maxim251 you did Mars Lander 3?
 michaellan: what approach did you use?
 michaellan: suspicious

 dctrdee: gui
 LazyMammal: xxd I'm not sure about the top bots, but I got to mid-Legend in Tron using Minimax
 michaellan: oh, interesting. thanks for sharing
 michaellan: what is each "turn" in your minimax
 michaellan: one "move" doesn't feel right
 michaellan: but maybe I'm wrong
 LazyMammal: Simple is usually best :D  Each turn in my minimax is one cycle making a move. Each cycle "wants" to maximize their heuristic.
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm 86th (and was above 50th years ago) with a minimax in Tron xxd
 BlaiseEbuth: Will probably take ot back one of these days... :thinking:
 xxd: hmm
 xxd: i
 xxd: i've never coded a minimax i think
 xxd: only MCTS so far
 xxd: and tron doesn't seem that complicated
 BlaiseEbuth: minimax is far less complicated to code
 LazyMammal: but you need a heuristic for minimax.  some games are a pain that way.  Tron has a good heuristic. Probably several good ones to choose from.
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 xxd: like "dont immediately die" right
 xxd: or more sophisticated than that? :P
 BlaiseEbuth: An evaluation function
 LazyMammal: I use area fill for Tron
 xxd: hmm ok
 xxd: gonna do MC for LoCM for now
 LazyMammal: If you use "sudden death" then your search tree has to go deep enough to evaluate all the ways your cycle can die.  A good heuristic can make an estimate of the current board.
 xxd: what do you mean by sudden death
 Stilgart: BlaiseEbuth: actually, a minimax for more than two players is quite hellish to code
 LazyMammal: If you only notice a "bad position" by dying the search doesn't get enough hints to prune branches early.
 xxd: I see
 Stilgart: the trick at tron is that you can ignore two fellows, do a minimax with the closest one, and still achieve good playing
 xxd: wow, that is actually very interesting
 Stilgart: (truth is, I had to test this to believe it)
 xxd: good thinking
 xxd: 4 player seems a bit overwhelming already for me, i think i'll pass for now
 LazyMammal: That's likely true, although I maximize each player in Tron.  For Photosynthesis I only maximized the bot's player
 LazyMammal: Btw, "optimized" versions of Minimax make it seem very complicated (e.g. Negascout).  But generic mimimax is simply "argmax(heuristic)" for all moves on a given turn. And that's simple for multiple players if you can get the heuristic from the point of view of each player.
 BlaiseEbuth: Stilgart?
 BlaiseEbuth: I have one. And I don't remember it was particularly hard to code.
 xxd: I think I am more interested in learning about minimax and its variants than actually coding it :rofl:
 xxd: like reading papers, watching videos etc.
 LazyMammal: It's fun to get it working tho! Also a working prototype is proof that you understand all the parts needed. They say "teaching someone" is the best way to learn. I think writing a bot has the same effect.  You have to be able to "explain in code"
 michaellan: hmm, fair point
 michaellan: I had so much excitement when my MCTS first worked
 Stilgart: BlaiseEbuth: it is hard to design, to begin with
 Stilgart: minimax is for two-players games
 Stilgart: there are multiple generalizations for more players, but one has to choose the appropriate one carefully
 BlaiseEbuth: That was precisely what I began with. ^^ First bot, first algo more complicated than a if/else forest.
 michaellan: hmm
 michaellan: these bot challenges are so intimidating
 BlaiseEbuth: But perhaps I had a lot of chance and avoided some difficulties without realizing it... :thinking:
 LazyMammal: Bot challenges are definitely harder than puzzles. each part isn't so hard but there are many parts and the choice of parts is entirely up to the coder. 
 BlaiseEbuth: Sad it's gonna be escape challenges now..&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: WHAT?  for real?  is that confirmed?
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't know...
 Wontonimo: just nasty rumors
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/solo-contests/1114/3">https://forum.codingame.com/t/solo-contests/1114/3</a>
 LazyMammal: "some changes" == escape challenge?
 BlaiseEbuth: Answering someone asking for 4 hours contest, that at least mean "not a bot challenge"
 Wontonimo: :wave: LazyMammal
 LazyMammal: I didn't get in on the escape room beta preview thingy.  Any fun?
 BlaiseEbuth: Tutorial is borring. Real rooms require other people, and other people are borring.
 LazyMammal: Okay.  To each their own, I guess.
 BlaiseEbuth: :p
 Wontonimo: woot, i just solved my own puzzle lol
 LazyMammal: different language at least?
 Wontonimo: 1/3rd the lines
 LazyMammal: :D
 michaellan: Wontonimo: I wonder why your comment asking for feedback got downvotes
 michaellan: seems odd to me
 BlaiseEbuth: Where where where? I want to downvote to!
 michaellan: &gt;:[
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: yeah, i guess someone doesn't like giving verbal feedback
 LazyMammal: “Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things.”― George Carlin
 Wontonimo: words of wisdom
 Wontonimo: I'll make sure to include you early next time BlaiseEbuth so you can get in on the action.
 BlaiseEbuth: WHAT?! I can't downvote anymore?! :rage:
 Wontonimo: nope, already approved
 michaellan: B)
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. That doesn't matter, I can always downvote.
 BlaiseEbuth: AND put one star. :imp:
 Wontonimo: be even worse, put zero stars
 BlaiseEbuth: Naa... :smirk:
 LazyMammal: “haters gonna hate”― 3LW
 Wontonimo: rats, i thought i almost had ya there
 masongtxr: hi
 Wontonimo: hi
 masongtxr: i'm the new player
 LazyMammal: welcome to Friday night bingo
 Wontonimo: if you put "the" in all caps it sounds more impressive
 BlaiseEbuth: ZE
 Wontonimo: have you checked out any of the multis masongtxr&#160;?  (the text is red because your name is in it.  that's all)
 masongtxr: i don't now
 masongtxr: or maybe yes
 LazyMammal: by "multis" wonton means the "Bot Programming" category under Activites -&gt; Compete.
 Wontonimo: Look at this replay from a multi called Coders Strikes Back.  Notice these noobs are just flying straight to the next checkpoint and not even correcting for drift or turning ahead of times <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/560822383">https://www.codingame.com/replay/560822383</a>
 michaellan: Wontonimo doesn't stop :joy:
 Wontonimo: what do you think, perhaps you could make a better bot, perhaps one that slows down right before getting to the checkpoint and turning more agressively?
 LazyMammal: Personally I'm a big fan of the solo puzzles.  The bot multis are cool too
 Westicles: are you talking to the guy who doesn't speak english?
 Wontonimo: hey, that multi was made to help people start multis
 BlaiseEbuth: No.
 michaellan: when will you learn that CSB is not noob friendly at all
 michaellan: just kidding
 Wontonimo: hey, it totally is
 LazyMammal: CSB is a great beginner multi.  Just ... walk before you run, right?  Maybe do some puzzles
 BlaiseEbuth: I was made. And then they putted an expeditive tuto on it.
 BlaiseEbuth: *it
 Wontonimo: it has a tutorial 
 michaellan: yeah 
 michaellan: but they coulda done that for UTTT wood or something
 Wontonimo: you are in gold xxd.  seems friendly enough
 masongtxr: no i't to hard for me
 michaellan: yeah but that is only because there is a key piece of information
 BlaiseEbuth: traduction: "see? even you are in gold, so it's friedly" :smirk:
 michaellan: also remember that i couldnt even get there after knowing it, for a while
 michaellan: :pensive:
 Wontonimo: there are 2 things i like about CSB for people who are new to CG.  1 - pretty graphics.  2 - lots and lots of people have submitted bots and so you get very fine grain feedback on even small changes to your reflex bot
 Westicles: probably better to figure out more about the person first
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. And stay stuck in the over 1000 players wood leagues if nobody give you the magic formula.
 BlaiseEbuth: That too
 michaellan: I got to silver with just boosting when distance to next checkpoint &gt; 400
 Wontonimo: it is the first link in the "related links"
 michaellan: nobody wants to RTFM
 michaellan: (although i agree it is important)
 Wontonimo: and i usually don't give the formula.  usually i give -v and then hint that it may have a better constant
 BlaiseEbuth: "newcoder: Hey! I'm new on the site.Wontonimo: Hey! Have you heard of our lord and savior CSB?"
 masongtxr: no
 Wontonimo: anyway.  let's take a poll:  Name the multi you'd suggest to new people who have only done clash to get them off clash?
 michaellan: masongtxr: I have one piece of advice. Don't focus on Clash of Code. It is nowhere near as rewarding as the other paths
 Westicles: A new guy who can barely communicate probably shouldn't be pointed toward any multi
 michaellan: I'm gonna have to play every so often, however, to keep my rank and codinpoints&#160;:[
 masongtxr: good advice
 BlaiseEbuth: If people don't ask for, I don't point...
 michaellan: Also, bash is his main language it seems
 michaellan: this guy is scary
 masongtxr: who
 michaellan: you
 masongtxr: ok
 Wontonimo: i think he means respect
 LazyMammal: 1. solo puzzles (classic)2. solo puzzles (turn based)3. solo puzzles (optimization)4. bot programming
 michaellan: what's a turn-based solo puzzle?
 michaellan: Oh nvm
 michaellan: Yeah but optiions 1 and 2 don't boost codinpoints, do they now :upside_down:
 LazyMammal: chasing the fake internet points.. can be fun!
 masongtxr: i'm now trying yo win code vs zomie
 Wontonimo: it's everything, don't knock my fake internet points!  I've worked hard for them so I will value them arbitrarily 
 michaellan: yeah i guess so
 michaellan: but i worked pretty hard for them
 michaellan: so i guess that imbues (sentimental?) value
 michaellan: for me
 Wontonimo: oh nice, code vs zombies is fun
 michaellan: maybe there should never have been codinpoints system
 michaellan: ignorance is bliss
 LazyMammal: yeah, CvZ is great.  you can use if/else rules or go "whole hog" and search like a multi
 Westicles: it depends how escape rooms get hooked up.  XP or CP or neither
 michaellan: Yikes
 masongtxr: but is a little hard for me
 michaellan: If escape rooms give CP, i might actually go and do it
 michaellan: I don't want to do it with some random people though, I might introduce it to the computer science club at my school
 Westicles: CP comes and goes, but XP is (mostly) indestructible. 
 Wontonimo: looks like i have zero progress in MCTS <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/MCTS">https://www.codingame.com/learn/MCTS</a>
 michaellan: Yeah. A lot of games with Minimax should also be ttagged MCTS
 LazyMammal: masongtxr maybe look at the easy and medium puzzle to see if you find something you like and is not too hard&#160;?
 masongtxr: i don't like puzzle 
 Wontonimo: what do you like?
 michaellan: Clashes?
 masongtxr: no
 michaellan: good.
 michaellan: Do you like using your brain to solve coding problems?
 LazyMammal: clashes are just timed puzzles 
 michaellan: yeah but they're easier
 LazyMammal: true
 michaellan: avereage class is easier than Easy classic
 michaellan: clash*
 Westicles: I think officially they like it if new guys are pointed toward the quest map...
 BlaiseEbuth: Officially they like if there is new guys. What a new guy do after, they don't care.
 Westicles: As long as he applies for a job at some point, yeah\
 Wontonimo: wow, a guy tries to promote multis and this happens
 michaellan: D:
 masongtxr: this is my old account <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/ef262ad0e8f6a2e469727c0354e82f824269734">https://www.codingame.com/profile/ef262ad0e8f6a2e469727c0354e82f824269734</a>
 masongtxr: i still keep it
 Westicles: have you tried CSB?
 BlaiseEbuth: 1) I don't think csb is a good advice for a first multi.2) I don't think multis should be recomanded systematically to newcomers.3) As a newcomer, not sure I would appreciate someone jumping on me to push me to do something, when I just said "hi" on the chat...
 BlaiseEbuth: But, hey, that's me.
 Westicles: agree
 Wontonimo: i don't agree
 masongtxr: 9 times but it just went wrong
 Wontonimo: what do you mean 9 times?
 masongtxr: in CSB
 Westicles: maybe he prefers Mars Lander :P
 masongtxr: no
 Westicles: me personally, I like algorithms.  so I started with the easy puzzles
 Wontonimo: so i've helped about 14 people get into multis via CSB.  Out of the 14, most need help just learning how to navigate the options in the multi.  It's actually not intuitive at all is what I've discovered.  CSB has the tutorial pop ups that really help a lot
 Wontonimo: when i say most, i mean about half.
 Westicles: the quest map shows you how to navigate that
 Wontonimo: i don't remember the quest map helping with telling the difference between "submit" and "arena"
 Wontonimo: or that you can change the opponents
 Wontonimo: or debug
 Wontonimo: or that all your arena submits are saved in history
 Westicles: they can always ask in the chat if they don't understand
 Wontonimo: really? do you think most people do that or just open it, say to themmselves "wtf" and then leave.  In my experience, it's the second
 Westicles: This goes back to the IQ discussion...
 Wontonimo: perhaps EQ
 Westicles: EQ is discriminatory against our friends on the spectrum. 
 juice0: even if one of those friends doesn't get it, or one of their friends... or neighbors
 BlaiseEbuth: What a shame we can't see when a contribution was posted...
 michaellan: stop trying to downvote!
 BlaiseEbuth: How many time did your puzzle stayed in WIP Wontonimo?
 Westicles: beach volleyball?
 BlaiseEbuth: Naa. Fax
 michaellan: Is there a max number of cards in hand for LoCM?
 michaellan: the anser is yes but I dont know what the value is
 BlaiseEbuth: RTFM?
 michaellan: RTSC (Read the source code)
 michaellan: the answer is 8
 michaellan: (apparently used to be 10)

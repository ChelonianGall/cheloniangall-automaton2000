 Xotiic_312: hello
 Xotiic_312: I am very new here just started my epic coding journey
 Mayssen: same here :fist:
 Xotiic_312: I sounded just like those weird intro people in every coding adventure right?
 Xotiic_312: bye
 thanshaw: anyone out there?

 Uljahn: press F1 for a list of commands
 joanne42moore: Is there some way to keep trying to solve a Clash of Code after the timer runs out? Not for credit of course, just to practice&#160;:)
 Uljahn: no
 joanne42moore: thanks Uljahn
 darkhorse64: try puzzles
 joanne42moore: Good idea darkhorse ^^
 Kingcrusher9211: code
 Passifi: thanks Uljahn

 UwU_HEWO_UwU: UwO
 darkhorse64: try easy puzzles first, especially the official ones, then either raise the level or random pick amongst others. The quality varies a lot, so follow your feelings and interests
 Astrobytes: amazing, in 8 out of 11 games I had 3 against you, darkhorse64, and 5 against... derjack
 darkhorse64: Before the approval, the choice of opponents is really working bad. I can admit very few games but opponent choices could follow the same rules
 Astrobytes: Yeah, very annoying. Meh.Now we just have to wait on everyone fixing their bots since your update!
 darkhorse64: I think I fixed the problem (quite easily actually). Amazons is buggy too: board origin is wrong. I did a fix for my own game but it was incomplete
 Astrobytes: Did you already comment on the Amazons contribution?
 darkhorse64: ofc
 Astrobytes: It's easy enough to compensate for in your bot but it is a little confusing. 
 darkhorse64: I also updated my repo so struct can pick the code if he wishes
 Astrobytes: Ah nice. Sharing is caring. Now you've returned the favour the balance is restored in the universe.
 darkhorse64: I did not change anything to my bot because I hardly use any inputs except previous move
 darkhorse64: I know inputs help for debugging butt they are mostly useless (size, side, moves, state)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's a convenient way I guess. I only added 4 chars
 Astrobytes: And yeah, my bot evolved from the debug bot so still uses everything
 Astrobytes: last move and number of moves  are the most useful for debugging anyway
 darkhorse64: I reuse my mcts tree, so I need to update the state rather than  rebuild it from scratch (is that correct&#160;?)
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: Hence importance of last move
 darkhorse64: I sometimes forget to ask for it in other contribs and I have to guess it from previous and current state
 Astrobytes: I think you've been quite consistent in asking for it recently though.
 derjack: whats changed?
 derjack: and whats wrong with amazons
 Astrobytes: Board is now given in the order that you see it on the screen 
 derjack: oh lol. i always randomly flip/rotate inputs to match mine
 darkhorse64: It bothers me to write one ab but I need to because I do not want my code to leak. I wonder if mobility as an eval is OK because if there is a white move, black has the same reversed. So eval cannot be the difference in mobility but the mobility itself
 Astrobytes: Yeah I do too derjack
 darkhorse64: amazons origin is wrong
 Astrobytes: mobility works to an extent, you might want to weight it heavier for one player to compensate
 Astrobytes: And regardless of what you write, it will leak anyway&#160;:/
 darkhorse64: My concern is whether it's a valid eval at all. If it beats random, that's OK. I plan to make something readable (no bitboarding, avx) 
 derjack: did msmits already update
 MSmits: just did, but i am in class, so cant chat :P
 Astrobytes: my first basic testing ab worked fine with 10 + pMobility - eMobility
 Astrobytes: Just to give it a nonzero score. It beat random no problem.
 darkhorse64: but msmits can code
 Astrobytes: Teaching or learning?
 MSmits: learning, my fp class
 Astrobytes: Get back to work!
 darkhorse64: pMobility - eMobility is not always 0 assuming its opp vs me&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Yes. That's why you should weight one side more than the other 
 Astrobytes: (for this basic boss bot, not for a real bot ofc)
 darkhorse64: OK but all nodes have the same score then&#160;?
 MSmits: btw: I've got basic mcts bot ready. Writing meta mcts now, or at least, adapting my othello one
 darkhorse64: It proves one thing: rushing to approve a contrib is a bad thing
 Astrobytes: Ah, wait. My mobility also takes number of surrounding enemy pieces into account
 Astrobytes: And yes, that's why they stay up for ages
 Astrobytes: Mostly.
 darkhorse64: It's an element of strategy in Clobber to group opponent pieces into islands, your feature makes sense
 darkhorse64: There is a recent contrib that is under the radar: Volcanoes. It's an original game (as opposed to a clone) and deserves a look. The statement really need an improvement because it's hard to understand how to win 
 Astrobytes: I saw that. I think it is based on an existing game however
 darkhorse64: Yep but the game designer itself ported it to CG
 darkhorse64: himself
 Astrobytes: Oh it's his game? That is rather awesome.
 darkhorse64: Worth a blog post from CG&#160;?:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Astrobytes: Hah!
 Astrobytes: The competition&#160;: fun ratio will have to be measured first :P
 darkhorse64: skotz is a regular contest participant
 darkhorse64: I expect Clobber FR to be low compared to BT
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've seen him last few contests
 Astrobytes: Feel free to suggest the idea to T
 Astrobytes: FR?
 Astrobytes: Fun ratio?
 MSmits: he expects French people will suck at Clobber
 Astrobytes: :fire:
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: The only feedback i got from fr is: "yet another board game"
 Astrobytes: hehehe, that sounds like fr
 Astrobytes: I guess it is a bit of a niche interest, that said: "be the change you want to see"
 darkhorse64: Yep, Clobber is a niche game mostly because there are no tactics involved
 Astrobytes: Abstract strategy games tend to polarize opinions due to aspects like that
 Astrobytes: *opinions from purists
 darkhorse64: fr is really different from world, content-wise. The discussed topics are really different
 Astrobytes: I do read it now and then&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Far more puzzle-oriented for a start
 Saad-py: Anyone does rust
 Astrobytes: That a statement or a question? It's somewhat ambiguous as it stands currently...
 AntiSquid: what do you usually discuss on FR darkhorse64
 TheBarnacle: I haven't been clashing long, are there mistakes with the tests occassionaly? Or should I just assume I'm wrong?
 TheBarnacle: It's two in a row where the second out of 5 has failed
 AntiSquid: clash is temporarily broken, play multiplayer for the time being
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a> TheBarnacle
 UnnamedCodinGamer: MSmits crushing it in clobber
 TheBarnacle: Good to know I'm not losing my mind, thank you!
 AntiSquid: glad to help
 Astrobytes: Did you expect anything less UnnamedCodinGamer? :D
 UnnamedCodinGamer: no
 UnnamedCodinGamer: certainly no
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 MSmits: i dont think it's stronger than yours
 MSmits: random luck
 MSmits: it's just basic mcts, nothing smart
 MSmits: I chose to expand all children at once and do 100+ sims
 MSmits: probably not the best choice
 MSmits: havent experimented with other ways
 MSmits: the branching reduces extremely quickly as game progresses
 darkhorse64: afk
 UnnamedCodinGamer: last four battles on my side are four losses against your program
 MSmits: hmm ok
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I wish I knew how to get my iteration count higher than 10k
 Astrobytes: yay I beat you once
 MSmits: i get 1500-2000 rollouts, but thats simulating from each child, so times 112 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: wow
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I feel miserable
 Char_2C: hi
 UnnamedCodinGamer: wondering where the slow parts are
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I also expand all children at once
 MSmits: Rollouts: 1280Sims: 112643
 Astrobytes: Assuming you're not allocating memory after the first turn, are you calculating something too often? Nodes too heavy?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: and I tried your idea of picking random direction in the rollout - it did not do anything to improve iteration count
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a4b4ae69-13b2-49cb-bd05-727ed0d8e65b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a4b4ae69-13b2-49cb-bd05-727ed0d8e65b</a>

 MSmits: dont store a vector
 MSmits: in a node
 Astrobytes: Ever
 Astrobytes: On CG
 Astrobytes: In fact you don't even need pointers. Just index of parent, index of first child, number of children
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b9feaf1a-54ec-41b6-ae55-eed2ec337928">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b9feaf1a-54ec-41b6-ae55-eed2ec337928</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm, yes
 MSmits: use a node pool
 UnnamedCodinGamer: makes sense
 MSmits: Node nodes[NODE_MAX];
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am already
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Move* nodes = new Move[5000000];
 Astrobytes: These changes will help you get the most out of your node pool
 MSmits: thats not the same
 MSmits: you have a pool of pointers
 MSmits: I have a pool of actual nodes
 Astrobytes: ^
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is not a pool of pointers - it is an array located on the free store
 derjack: high branching factor lowering as game progresses? thats job for books
 MSmits: sure but the vector of moves is not in the pool
 derjack: have you counted how many unique moves are thre
 MSmits: first turn it's 112
 MSmits: next probably 108 or so
 UnnamedCodinGamer: MSmits, which vector of moves do you mean?
 derjack: unique as exclude symmetry
 MSmits: vector&lt;Move*&gt; children;
 Astrobytes: the one on your node
 MSmits: thats dymically allocated
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 MSmits: dynamically
 MSmits: dont do dynamic allocation
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I will get rid of it
 derjack: hes conservative, he doenst like dynamics
 MSmits: yea
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I can do only indexes
 MSmits: the children are sequential
 MSmits: so just refer to the place in the pool they are at
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, that is what I meant
 UnnamedCodinGamer: how do I sort them then?
 MSmits: you sort them in mcts?&gt;
 MSmits: I never sorted anything in mcts
 Astrobytes: that's what the stats are for
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I sort them in the selection phase to get the one with the highest uct value
 MSmits: no need to sort
 MSmits: just remember the highest value and best node
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: sorting is very slow
 derjack: ucbScore in node, you write uct value in node?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7c377cc-ad93-4498-afa1-b74da4ff4781">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7c377cc-ad93-4498-afa1-b74da4ff4781</a>
 derjack: during selection just iterate over children
 derjack: its O(n) instead of sorting O(nlogn)
 Astrobytes: Yep, no need for the sorting at all.
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29192a7c-1cfe-4e97-8c85-dd0d815d72c2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/29192a7c-1cfe-4e97-8c85-dd0d815d72c2</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: i see
 MSmits: status is solved status
 MSmits: 2 means not solved
 MSmits: -1,0,1 is solved, except 0 doesnt happen in clobber
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/QtYavalath/blob/master/src/ai/cpu.cpp#L66">https://github.com/jdermont/QtYavalath/blob/master/src/ai/cpu.cpp#L66</a>
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks a guys, that was very helpful
 MSmits: np
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I was sure what I am doing is heavily unoptimized
 MSmits: yea, but should improve a lot now
 Astrobytes: Yep. Unfortunately MCTS doesn't work 'straight out of the box', as it were, on CG
 MSmits: what do you mean Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Or rather, it does, but not well.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: actually it works, but not competitively 
 MSmits: it's not a CG thing, the stuff you find on google is just poorly optimized
 Astrobytes: Look at most implementations of MCTS in the wild MSmits
 Astrobytes: That's what people try to implement on here.
 MSmits: yeah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the algorithm is algorithm - it either works or not
 derjack: especially in python
 MSmits: it works, but it's not necessarily fast
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the problem is that you need iteration counts to be high to compete
 MSmits: not all sorting algorithms are equally  fast either
 UnnamedCodinGamer: exactly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this is just a side of CG
 MSmits: right
 derjack: or any competition
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: that is why I do not like competitions
 MSmits: i hardly worry about these things anymore though, you get used to writing optimized code
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, it is a craft
 MSmits: mostly i spend time experimenting with actual eval features or heuristics
 derjack: witchcraft
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hah
 MSmits: some ways of doing things in optimized fashion are also easier
 MSmits: working with object pools for example, means you dont need to worry about leaking memory/collecting garbage
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes, it is handy
 MSmits: of course you may run out of actual object pool but that only happens when your node is really big, or your bot really fas
 MSmits: and if it's really fast, then that is mostly a good thing&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's just that for professional coders, or coders that do other things besides CG, this way of coding things may run counter to every fibre of their being
 MSmits: you're going against a lot of convetions
 MSmits: conventions
 MSmits: maybe that's something you dont like
 MSmits: for example, i define my node for the nodepool without any default value, so it's unassigned memory. 
 MSmits: your IDE may complain
 MSmits: but assigning 600+ Mb of memory before the game is not really an option
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I guess this is the "witch" part of the craft
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it also makes doing this in C# or java hard
 MSmits: those languages complain even harder when you do this
 MSmits: need some workarounds I think
 MSmits: btw, before you think i am some kind of c++ wizard. I know almost nothing of c++ besides what i need to write a bot
 MSmits: highly specialized
 MSmits: I can't make a simple app in c++
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I also started to learn it "due to" CG
 MSmits: ahh ok, same boat then
 MSmits: I can do a bit more in python and C#
 MSmits: my meta mcts apps are all C# windows forms programs calling c++ bots
 MSmits: and for work, i teach programming in python
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I started 5-6 years ago with python, then switched to java, now to c++ mainly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I code in my free time
 UnnamedCodinGamer: so I am not a master of any of them
 MSmits: same mostly. Though I hope to teach some more classes at work. Only 4 hrs a week currently
 MSmits: maybe next year 6-8 hrs a week. Rest of the time is teaching physics
 MSmits: we need to motivate students to pick our subject. The more students, the more hrs i get to teach CS
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you also do a bit of teaching here&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah thats true, I also learn a lot though. Most of the general botting knowledge i share, is stuff others taught me
 MSmits: some of the game-specific knowledge comes from me
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am also keeping an eye on the chat and try to implement the things that I understand
 MSmits: cool, we also have a chat log somewhere 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I think I lost the link, I had it
 MSmits: yeah it's a wiki thing, i never look at it myself
 MSmits: someone will share it again
 MSmits: gonna try to get meta mcts working for clobber, to see if it's valid to keep it at 8x8
 ZarthaxX: smito
 MSmits: hey zarthy
 ZarthaxX: im back 
 ZarthaxX: and hey
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 MSmits: hows it going
 ZarthaxX: super good, came back from 2 weeks holidays
 ZarthaxX: went with my gf's family
 ZarthaxX: amazing ppl
 MSmits: no covid issues?
 ZarthaxX: we just had to get a certificate online to go, but no one asked for it during the holidays
 ZarthaxX: argentina is dumb, as always
 MSmits: oh ok
 ZarthaxX: how is your stuff
 AntiSquid: did lockdown stop in netherlands after all the protests MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: stuffs ok, pretty busy with studies and work
 ZarthaxX: the classic
 MSmits: no, the protests were not supported by the general public AntiSquid
 MSmits: just idiots
 ZarthaxX: i wanted to ask you smth real quick about your comp sci class
 MSmits: it doesnt take that many of them to cause problems
 MSmits: ZarthaxX the one i follow as student or what i do as teacher?
 ZarthaxX: teacher
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: sure
 ZarthaxX: just wanted to know what you do, like a general idea
 ZarthaxX: because my class went from arduino to coding termporarily
 AntiSquid: idk what is general public&#160;? how do you tell the&#160;% of people supporting it? i see crowds of protesters everywhere, but i won't have the numbers regardless
 MSmits: oh, depends on the subject. I mostly follow my colleague, he does most of the preparatory work. These last 2 months we've been working on teaching python
 ZarthaxX: wanted to know what i can add
 ZarthaxX: and do you use any platform to teach python?
 ZarthaxX: or just do excercises in class and that's all
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's a minority of 20-25% that are against parts of the lockdown, of which a small percentage actually protest
 MSmits: ZarthaxX we use trinket.io
 MSmits: my colleague prepares working examples, embedded so they cant see the code, just what it does
 ZarthaxX: ahhh nice
 MSmits: well and also shared examples with actual code
 MSmits: then they get automatically graded examples
 ZarthaxX: great
 MSmits: using coderunner
 ZarthaxX: i was planning to teach coding but with blocks here
 MSmits: he has an entire framework in moodle
 AntiSquid: and you got the numbers from? i wouldn't trust anyone on the numbers, there's a small percentage of protesters, but it doesn't reflect real numbers of people who wish they protested ...anyways UK will be low as long as furlough keeps going i guess lol
 MSmits: open source elo
 AntiSquid: do you get gov money&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: because i have 12yo
 MSmits: AntiSquid probably polling etc.
 MSmits: you can do this with 12yo also
 ZarthaxX: i dont have to grade here so no problem
 MSmits: we actually start quite late with coding
 MSmits: i didnt mean grading with grades
 ZarthaxX: okey
 AntiSquid: do you do scratch ZarthaxX&#160;?
 MSmits: i just meant autocorrect
 MSmits: good... not good
 MSmits: autochecking?
 ZarthaxX: no, i use code.org AntiSquid
 ZarthaxX: it has a guided course for the different concepts, and you learn doing thematic stuff like minecraft, which everyone loves
 ZarthaxX: MSmits ah misunderstood grading :P
 AntiSquid: teach them anaconda / jupyter notebook, it's not going anywhere, might as well ...
 ZarthaxX: mmm
 Astrobytes: damn, was afk, long phonecall. I missed some stuff it seems
 MSmits: yeah we tried to get as much conversation in as we could before you came back Astrobytes
 darkhorse64: Nothing really happened: MSmits just leaked his entire Clobber bot
 Astrobytes: MSmits: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: :thinking: accidentally pushed kovi to #1 now 
 Astrobytes: lol darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: I'll use his code for the bot now that it is public
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: well it's so basic, i know i am not going to be nr 1 with this anyway
 MSmits: or did you see anything you didnt know darkhorse64?
 Astrobytes: Was gonna say, it all looked like standard Smits stuff
 MSmits: ehh that only confirms that i share too much :P
 darkhorse64: I see you are doing things slightly more efficiently 
 Astrobytes: The simulation code looks messy but fast
 Astrobytes: Well, not messy as such
 MSmits: darkhorse64 you can do this in uttt as well
 MSmits: union the 9 int gamestate with 3 uint64_ty
 MSmits: popcount them
 MSmits: then do an if else thing to find the correct miniboard
 MSmits: its faster than a 9 miniboard loop
 MSmits: 9 uint16_t i mean
 MSmits: not int
 Astrobytes: Nice
 darkhorse64: I have even considered a unique 128 bit thing
 darkhorse64: I would like to avoid if then else in the code
 Astrobytes: I always forget about uint128 s
 MSmits: i havent found a good way to use avx do find a random bit
 MSmits: to
 MSmits: i think avx 512 has something
 darkhorse64: Yep, that's the issue
 darkhorse64: Top 3 fireworks in 0.02
 darkhorse64: And some complain about  RPS in UTTT
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: it has RPS, but less than most games
 MSmits: also, I suspect Vingte has a book, that reinforces RPS a bit
 MSmits: and the best bots are fairly deterministic. The NN's almost always are and kar liso has a huge expansion function with (I assume)  a lot of pruning. That may reinforce RPS as well
 MSmits: but RPS usually comes from both sides. If one of the two players is very random, it should solve the problem
 AntiSquid: i just done basically a massive improvement and fixed a bug in my bot, dropped 2 ranks darkhorse64 :D
 AntiSquid: problem is majority of bots are focused on overall performance, not on completing the columns from what i can see
 AntiSquid: for example they keep discarding 5ers, like wtf&#160;?
 darkhorse64: I coded an improvement for discarding cards and dropped similarly. Too smart
 kovi: new rule in fireworks or just lucky push?
 AntiSquid: lucky i think unless you improved
 AntiSquid: your bot fits best for this environment i guess
 AntiSquid: where people discard 5ers
 kovi: do they?
 AntiSquid: not sure how many do, but seen it happen even after i hint the 5&#160;!
 AntiSquid: this is just one of the things i'd like to nitpick on
 darkhorse64: Is the change implemented&#160;? I see no mention of a penalty for an error
 darkhorse64: in the statement
 AntiSquid: don't think it was implemented
 darkhorse64: my bad: penalty is mentioned in the statement
 darkhorse64: trying to join the 31 club&#160;?
 AntiSquid: who&#160;?
 MSmits: whats the 31 club?
 jacek: im getting 30 this year
 MSmits: I'm 40 
 MSmits: too old&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: 16
 darkhorse64: those who score 31 at fireworks
 MSmits: you're not 16 AntiSquid :P
 AntiSquid: how do you know?
 MSmits: you were a chef
 MSmits: or are
 MSmits: not sure if it is like a lifetime title
 MadKnight: how old is Automaton2000&#160;?
 AntiSquid: maybe i was underaged all this time and role playing in chat
 Automaton2000: do you have to reach the goal
 MSmits: ahh i see
 MSmits: were you also roleplaying liking botters of the galaxy&#160;?&gt;
 AntiSquid: try the game
 MSmits: :grin:
 AntiSquid: without the biased influence
 MSmits: I'm just messing with you
 AntiSquid: with a neutral view point
 MSmits: will do eventually, it actually did seem attractive
 MSmits: i was turned off by the bad rep
 AntiSquid: it doesn't matter if you liek it or not, but don't base your opinion just on other opinions
 MSmits: well it's better than nothing
 MSmits: it's the whole basis for people writing reviews&#160;:)
 jacek: bad rep?
 AntiSquid: you can take any CG game there will be people who like and dislike, question is who is most vocal imo
 MSmits: true
 KelvinAndHubbles: is there any opinions based on facts? Or just your interpretation of said facts
 AntiSquid: if facts == personal preference return trueelse dunno what you are referring to
 MSmits: there's facts and there's facts. Some facts you can't twist around, but you can ignore. Others, that are more statistical in nature, for example, are easy to twist to your purposes
 darkhorse64: Re personal opinion, I think I like CalM or Fireworks because it's a matter of fine tuning a state machine. Others frankly dislike this kind of voodoo. My issue with BotG which is also a state machine is that there are too many things to tune up to the point I do not see how to address the problem
 AntiSquid: we should get a new league for fireworks, top 10-15  or something like that, there are some weird bots that snuck into wood1 rotting at the bottom
 AntiSquid: or maybe they are all weird and i didn't pay enough attention&#160;?
 darkhorse64: A new league with no penalty for fuses&#160;?
 AntiSquid: eh why not
 AntiSquid: or maybe we should all push into a test contrib first&#160;? the top bots see what happens&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no way to remove leagues after adding unfortunately
 darkhorse64: The boss should have filtered the weird bots; it's not very kind for noobs
 AntiSquid: use current tric as boss :P
 AntiSquid: anything lower than top 10 is probably bots playing worse than humans anyway
 darkhorse64: The amount of things to memorize in this game is insane
 darkhorse64: for a human
 AntiSquid: doable to some extent if you play the game alot
 AntiSquid: there are harder versions of this game btw, rainbow and black rows 
 darkhorse64: Memorize all hints, all played cards&#160;?
 AntiSquid: and black rows are opposite of regular rows, there is only one 1 black and you start with 5s, it's in reverse
 AntiSquid: memorize as much as possible, but for more serious players for sure memorize everything
 AntiSquid: "counting cards"
 Astrobytes: Don't you make notes playing irl?
 AntiSquid: we didn't, it was just for fun anyway
 jacek: as in, cheating?
 Astrobytes: No, keeping them to yourself
 AntiSquid: ya you'd need to cover your own info you tracked lol
 darkhorse64: If you read papers on Hanabi, the best strategy is cheating by linking hints to a preestablished code
 AntiSquid: makes sense
 darkhorse64: Which players must agree on a communication convention, not really doable with bots
 darkhorse64: which means
 AntiSquid: well it is
 AntiSquid: that's a downside though of opening new league probably
 AntiSquid: forcing a meta on bots
 AntiSquid: if you have a lot of similar bots that work in similar way they might have an advantage
 AntiSquid: and push each other to the top
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Deepmind has multiple strategies including cheating like that
 Astrobytes: for Hanabi
 darkhorse64: Actually, sometimes, I select 4 copies of my bot and see how they cooperate. It's easier to debug their behaviour and the final score is a good measure on their cooperation
 AntiSquid: missed the deepmind news on hanabi, must be interesting Astrobytes
 jacek: nn on hanabi?
 darkhorse64: deepming or facebook ai group
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: it makes sense sort of, but then how does it know how to play with good and bad players and still come on top&#160;?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: Yeah, there's several articles out on the subject. There's the Hanabi Learning Environment,  I think Openspiel has something for it, and I think muzero had a go at it most recently
 AntiSquid: i define bad players as those who don't score much during rounds
 Astrobytes: I can't remember all the details so you'll need to do some digging
 darkhorse64: Yes, my assumptions are others don't lie and listen to me
 AntiSquid: there was a 2 min paper video too: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD-eXjf854Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD-eXjf854Q</a> must have missed it somehow 
 AntiSquid: or forgot about it&#160;? 2 years ...
 darkhorse64: When testing with others, my experience is that strong bots get you higher
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1Ll4fhRso">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1Ll4fhRso</a>
 jacek: complaining about rps
 AntiSquid: so just need a hanabi robot that flips cards fast enough without anyone noticing it
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes can't find anything saying there's a strong AI for hanabi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/23/deepminds-muzero-picks-up-the-rules-of-games-as-it-plays/">https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/23/deepminds-muzero-picks-up-the-rules-of-games-as-it-plays/</a>
 AntiSquid: latest article i found and it doesn't say the bot is a strong hanabi player
 AntiSquid: " like in the board game Diplomacy or the card game Hanabi. (Coincidentally, DeepMind is developing a separate family of algorithms to tackle Diplomacy and setups similar to it."
 Astrobytes: I did not mention the word 'strong' at any point
 Astrobytes: It's not exactly an easy goal to achieve
 AntiSquid: no, but am looking for strong AI results, i have my expectations up there
 Astrobytes: They get worse as more players are added apparently
 Astrobytes: Feel free to create your own:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/deepmind/hanabi-learning-environment">https://github.com/deepmind/hanabi-learning-environment</a>
 AntiSquid: for hanabi i am not surprised, imo you need to play completely different depending on other's skill / play style
 AntiSquid: one of my TODO items is to track allies play style and then memorize which one is which across all 3 rounds :P
 kovi: same
 kovi: too bad you cant watch others playing
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: maybe new league with that kind of new input&#160;? lol
 AntiSquid: but then you are at advantage if you don't play first round no&#160;?
 kovi: i didnt wanted to go into details, but that was my hidden agende vs. misleading says
 kovi: "misleading"
 AntiSquid:  // TODO// EXPLOIT BS HINT BUG -1 point for wrong play
 kovi: true about order. also knowing exact scores make it possible to assess risk better toward final score on last game
 AntiSquid: it's just a matter of balancing when to use it, to still score high during your round :D
 Astrobytes: Seems we need more Japanese games, haven't seen squiddy this excited about a game in ages :P
 Passifi: Hanabi is a french game,no&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Should I rename Clobber to ClobberSan
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: HAH
 AntiSquid: Hanabi (lit. flower fire) were popularised and developed during the resplendent days of Edo and have come to hold cultural significance in Japan both in physical displays and metaphorically as a symbol of ephemeral beauty. Passifi from google
 AntiSquid: maybe they had a french invasion i don't know
 Astrobytes: Yeah Passifi the designer was French but it's based on a Japanese game iirc
 darkhorse64: Hanabi is a very unusual CG game. Get better helping others
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes it's games that are popular with the play i play with i guess lol
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: no it's not jap games
 Astrobytes: Still laughing at ClobberSan
 AntiSquid: there was one card game i would be happy to try on CG, forgot name, will search now
 AntiSquid: name&#160;:   star realmswell not that popular, but a personal favorite
 Astrobytes: LoCaM in space?
 AntiSquid: very simple rules compared to LOCM
 AntiSquid: the draft phase is sort of blended in with the actual play
 AntiSquid: you pick up cards as you go and discard the starting cards
 AntiSquid: gradually building your deck
 AntiSquid: the middle row of cards are purchasable cards, the ones you can draft with points
 AntiSquid: then you have top row (enemy) and bottom row your own cards
 AntiSquid: you can hold 5 cars at a time and you keep cycling through your deck which is starting cards (basic tokens) + whatever you drafted
 Astrobytes: Looks fun to play irl
 AntiSquid: allows for far more interesting combos, you build your combos as you go yes
 AntiSquid: it is fun in real life, either way it's also much easier than LOCM i believe, but then if i think carefully about it you would still have a list of scores for each individual card, but that would have to fluctuate much more based on your deck (in a bot game)
 Astrobytes: Feel free to create a working prototype version if you think it's worth trying
 AntiSquid: nah have other stuff in mind + that game would be high effort in compiling statistics for drafts :P
 AntiSquid: offtopic, any suggestions for a stone frying pan&#160;? Astrobytes or you use regular ones?
 Astrobytes: Just regular ones atm AntiSquid as I'm on electric currently
 jacek: would stone frying pan work on induction hob? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Depends on the base
 AntiSquid: can be just stone coated
 AntiSquid: so bottom still alu
 Astrobytes: I don't have any particular recommendations but as I always say, don't go too cheap but don't go ridiculous
 Astrobytes: Unless you're buying knives ofc :P
 AntiSquid: so damascus steel knives straight from japanese black smiths for 500+ £, yes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: If I could afford that I most definitely would!
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 AntiSquid: joking, had a colleague who was showing me his current damascus knife and was about to order another one
 RSBat: A question about SameGame - am I supposed to solve it in 20 second given on CG or solve it offline and hardcode solutions?
 AntiSquid: the kind of crazy that also booked a table at raymond blanc restaurant for 400 pounds or whatever teh cost was
 Astrobytes: Either or
 Astrobytes: RSBat
 RSBat: cool
 Astrobytes: I had lunch at Marcus Wareing @ The Berkely once AntiSquid - I wasn't paying thankfully. That was a bloody expensive lunch.
 AntiSquid: what did you find exceptional about it&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Everything.It was a completely perfect experience from start to finish.
 Astrobytes: The only thing I could moan about was the inclusion of goat curd in one of the surprise courses. Even then it was pretty good for goat curd.
 AntiSquid: just curious about what you had to eat and stuff
 AntiSquid: you had a vegetarian option&#160;?
 AntiSquid: or vegan&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Wasn't veggie at the time!Everything from deconstructed fish and chips with salt and vinegar (a shot glass was involved), pork fat quavers, the aforementioned goat curds, peas and other green veg, venison, halibut
 Astrobytes: The guy paying actually got the veggie option
 Astrobytes: Bespoke dishes for every course
 Astrobytes: Based on what he liked (or rather not featuring things he didn't like)
 Astrobytes: There were so many dishes I forget
 Astrobytes: We only ordered 3 but they bring you stuff constantly
 Astrobytes: I mean we spent over £500 on Bordeaux and stayed until the start of evening service so I guess they liked our money.
 Astrobytes: (Was a birthday lunch for yours truly paid for by my boss at the time)
 AntiSquid: oh lol
 Astrobytes: I could never afford that!
 AntiSquid: good bday then
 Astrobytes: Yes. Very memorable.
 Astrobytes: The food was genuinely exciting as well as exquisitely tasty.
 Astrobytes: The service was out of this world, as it should be at that price point.
 Astrobytes: Also the only time I've ever had a £65 double rum
 jacek: yaar
 Astrobytes: The same day I also got an Atul Kochar fish cookbook, signed, which I left in the taxi as I was a bit tipsy&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Sadly, after that it was back to normal diet of kebabs and curries
 hahahabro1: sdsd
 Astrobytes: Your keyboard works.
 BlaiseEbuth: The 's' and 'd' keys work.
 Theino: he actually typed "how is the chat doing on such a fine day", but only his 's' and 'd' key work
 BlaiseEbuth: You are probably right...
 AntiSquid: i would say on the internet nobody knows you're a cat at the keyboard, but watched "Spycraft" series and i think someone will know what kind of house pet typed
 darkhorse64: He is playing Doom and runs in circles to escape imps
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: When I play Doom the imps run in circle to escape me.
 darkhorse64: Chuck Norris fact&#160;?
 AntiSquid: must be a nexusmod for doom
 Lynnial: :grimacing:
 Rob21: hello
 jacek: good afternoon
 benjumea: Hi guys
 Wontonimo: &gt; Sadly, after that it was back to normal diet of kebabs and curriesWhat?  why is that sad Astrobytes&#160;?  Kebabs are the best!
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo :D
 Wontonimo: we've heard of book attacks on other bot contests.  How do you think a book attack would work on Fireworks? 
 jacek: books would be burned quickly
 Wontonimo: i mean, not "whats the implementation", but "how effective would it be"
 darkhorse64: how can you design a book with random decks&#160;?
 Wontonimo: so, not effective is what i'm hearing&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I don't even see how it could be achievable
 Wontonimo: i thought the deck was static, but it was shuffled
 Wontonimo: (sorry, maybe I should start playing the game before getting into this detail)
 darkhorse64: My advice: the game is a bit difficult to understand at first, use the default code and print the inputs. Play a game and replay it step by step. Things will get much clearer and you can start design your bot and have fun
 jacek: fun? cooperating with people?!
 darkhorse64: Use their time to wreck them, actually
 Wontonimo: oh, pretend cooperation
 Wontonimo: way better than actual cooperation
 darkhorse64: I do not recommend this strategy for Fireworks
 Passifi: Today I solved a puzzle I was stuck on for 4 days I was so happy I started to scream and  jump and after that I felt completly used up and now I am here again I think I am developing a serious problem ... :upside_down:
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's like that
 Wontonimo: i'm always chasing that next experience like that

 Astrobytes: English in world chat please guys
 benjumea: bir miktar
 Astrobytes: You can go to DMs or make a channel 
 benjumea: why english? we are not all english
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: Because English is spoken in 'World' chat
 awnion: L=logic :p
 Astrobytes: There are country specific channels too
 planck6: okey only speak english 
 planck6: sorry
 jacek: dont mind him, he still lives at times when britain had colonies all over the world
 benjumea: yeah but English is not the "World" language&#160;;) 
 benjumea: yeah buddy I see
 benjumea: hahah
 awnion: English does not belong to England btw&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: It's OK it's not a major sin or anything, it's just English is used in World chat so we can all talk together
 benjumea: ok no problem guy don't worry 
 Astrobytes: I don't make the rules
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm Scottish, I'd rather speak that :P
 awnion: I personally hate English as a language but I speak English because I appreciate other's right to have information
 KelvinAndHubbles: I like english bc I knew how to read it&#160;:/
 awnion: until you have to deal with rough tough and other interesting words like wait and weight :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah the homophones are ridiculous
 RSBat: but they should exist in every language
 Astrobytes: to/too/two, hear/here, they're,their,there
 KelvinAndHubbles: I mean, you get figure out based on context
 KelvinAndHubbles: but yeah
 benjumea: hahah in french also there are many homophones  "banc /bon " 
 awnion: I remember an old English comedy short movie: "four candles" vs. "fork handle"
 Astrobytes: Yeah I think French has the most iirc!
 Astrobytes: awnion: Yep. The Two Ronnies, a classic
 darkhorse64: vert verre vers vair as an example
 Astrobytes: hehe yep
 benjumea: yeah with some final letters that we never pronounce "beaucoup, aux.."
 benjumea: My native language is arabic we don't have these issues like you europeans or americans
 benjumea: hahah
 darkhorse64: I like my language like with all these strange rules, exceptions. It's like life
 Astrobytes: lol, Arabic is quite different to the Western languages for sure!
 Astrobytes: All languages are pretty interesting in some way or another tbh
 MSmits: Schmetterling!
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 jacek: :scream:
 jacek: AutomatonNN where is the frog
 AutomatonNN: u know how to code
 benjumea: yeah all languages are beautiful
 jacek: like D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AutomatonNN learn them something
 AutomatonNN: when do you think that it could be fun&#160;?
 Astrobytes: jacek :expressionless:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: AutomatonNN 1==0?

 AutomatonNN: 43 of the contests with the problem in the contest
 jacek: AutomatonNN what's eval("rm -rf /*")?

 trictrac: to all fireworks players&#160;: in upper league, bad proposal costs nothing
 trictrac: game has been updates
 trictrac: updated

 Tuo: why not kovi s idea of 0 , -1 , -2
 trictrac: Original rules
 JLukeSkywalker: for game config, is your base config the lowest wood, then it goes up your lvl 1,2,etc?
 VIgoroth34: could someone help me with my pod racing program? im trying to use chechkpoint angles 
 VIgoroth34: checkpoint*
 JLukeSkywalker: what would you like to do with them?
 VIgoroth34: i would like for them to stop or slow down when the next point is past 90 degrees from the AI
 JLukeSkywalker: that would be taking the absolute and iffing against 90
 JLukeSkywalker: should work
 JLukeSkywalker: if its greater, use less thrust
 VIgoroth34: alright thank you ill give it a try
 MonishM: make a speed variable and change it to 0 or 5, then in your print statement add the variable to the end
 JLukeSkywalker: i do suggest lowering it from 90 though, think i ended up in the range 60-75 depending on the rest of my code
 JLukeSkywalker: thats something you can pretty easily tune manually though by just raising/lowering and playing the same course a couple times
 VIgoroth34: i think its starting to work now its a bit slow it keeps going past then making a turn so i will start lowering the turn degrees. 
 JLukeSkywalker: you can also slow down as you approach the target
 JLukeSkywalker: just as a simple strategy to start
 VIgoroth34: for that would i take the checkpoint distance and make it when the AI approaches a certian distance it slows down?
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, not by much though
 JLukeSkywalker: eventually the goal is to never slow down
 JLukeSkywalker: but you cant aim exactly for the targets to do that
 VIgoroth34: what distance should i use?
 ejpon: Slowing down near targets can punish you if there are many targets close to eachother
 ejpon: But those are not frequent
 VIgoroth34: i keep getting error codes now
 JLukeSkywalker: thrust might have to be an int
 VIgoroth34: let me make an int for it and ill see if it works
 VIgoroth34: its now saying that the program is not providing input lines
 JLukeSkywalker: can you paste your code in here?
 JLukeSkywalker: it will automatically paste-bin it
 VIgoroth34: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0513efac-036b-41fe-a643-3752da381c08">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0513efac-036b-41fe-a643-3752da381c08</a>
 VIgoroth34: i got rid of the thrust
 JLukeSkywalker: you can only print once
 JLukeSkywalker: so it looks like your if would have to go b4 the print
 JLukeSkywalker: and instead of 100 use that thruat var
 JLukeSkywalker: so i would do thrust = 100if dist &lt; threshold: thrust = 90print ..... + thrust
 JLukeSkywalker: if that makes sense
 VIgoroth34: i think so would i make the "100"  thrust after i do that?
 JLukeSkywalker: the variable would start at 100
 JLukeSkywalker: then if your distance is under, it sets it lower
 JLukeSkywalker: then use that variable in the print
 LePtitViking: {k &lt; row':
 Tuo: quickly changed my code for new Fireworks rules. turns out that when playing with good bots the penalty didnt matter that much, there is often better things to do then play risky
 Tuo: also noticed that my bot crashes from time to time :D still #1
 ejpon: There is nothing as a bugless code :D
 AntiSquid: you removed risky plays tuo&#160;?
 AntiSquid: getting pushed :o
 Tuo: removed penalty for risky plays -&gt; more risky plays&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you mean it was removed? trictrac updated statement? i didn't refresh to check
 Tuo: y
 AntiSquid: not entirely sure what to do with 3rd error now ... 
 AntiSquid: i avoid it atm
 Tuo: *4th and yes for an 50/50 play the upside would need to be something like 150 points for it to be worth the risk :D
 AntiSquid: 4 errors now&#160;? now this is a bit controversial what is actually part of original rules, but w/e at least you aren't instantly punished for trying
 Tuo: you have 3 errors to play with, that was the original
 AntiSquid: yes
 Tuo: and 4th one loses the round
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: well ....
 AntiSquid: depends .
 AntiSquid: we played with 3rd loses the round
 MSmits: mmh i started my clobber meta mcts, but i think it's bugged =/
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e02445c0-302d-4b71-8e05-57025721b600">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e02445c0-302d-4b71-8e05-57025721b600</a>
 AntiSquid: but w/e saw a lot of people online saying they play with 4
 AntiSquid: share replay MSmits
 MSmits: it prints othello and says its solved after 2 visits :P
 AntiSquid: MSmits i think you fked up somewhere 
 MSmits: oh right, i forgot to change the starting board
 MSmits: if you start clobber with 4 tiles it ends quite quickly&#160;!
 ZeGermans: Hey is there a way to get the full input of a task so I can figure out the problem locally. Im printing it out but the output is so long i keep getting ... between elements.
 jacek: and who wins?
 AntiSquid: what game ZeGermans
 ZeGermans: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-spreadsheet">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-spreadsheet</a>
 AntiSquid: just read the default code, it tells you how to debug
 ZeGermans: The last task Deep Birecursion, i keep getting timed out but I don't really know what's going on so I wanted to examine the input.
 MSmits: dont remember jacek, but its sort of working now, except it starts with black
 AntiSquid: for any language
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f7027a46-202f-4bde-8e33-2d877f461e2c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f7027a46-202f-4bde-8e33-2d877f461e2c</a>
 jacek: 58? i would think you can reduce more
 AntiSquid: what am i looking at MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: no this is total nodes created
 ZeGermans: I am AntiSquid but the input is cutout like this 
 ZeGermans: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/XivCHv9u">https://pastebin.com/XivCHv9u</a>
 AntiSquid: don't know how to read the starts
 MSmits: if you look closely it's a quarter
 MSmits:  i think
 jacek: around 30
 MSmits: yeah so reduced to 1/4 on first move due to symmetry
 MSmits: i just did the same thing i did with othello
 MSmits: should work
 MSmits: AntiSquid it's a white/black board with x,y coordinates moving to other x,y coordinates
 MSmits: so 0,0 to 1,0
 AntiSquid: 8x8&#160;? ah nvm i was thinking of connect4, are you done with that&#160;?
 MSmits: except thats a black piece so its bugged
 MSmits: no thats running
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c208fb10-c016-46e9-9641-3e15b8f9cc4c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c208fb10-c016-46e9-9641-3e15b8f9cc4c</a>
 AntiSquid: i have a theory for why your bot picks col 1 for first player and 2nd player plays mid
 MSmits: oh, why is that?
 jacek: oh i pushed agade up in oware
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/592ad760-47ab-4402-8315-efbeec3d3223">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/592ad760-47ab-4402-8315-efbeec3d3223</a>
 MSmits: its this node btw AntiSquid
 MSmits: so you can see how much it likes center
 jacek: and it likes stacking
 AntiSquid: for 2nd it's not right middle&#160;?
 MSmits: 4 is middle
 MSmits: the moves arent sorted properly
 MSmits: dont remember why, just look at the m:1
 MSmits: m:4 i mean
 AntiSquid: why is m:1 at the bottom&#160;?
 MSmits: oh i do remember
 MSmits: its because its higher
 MSmits: they're sorted bottom up as well
 MSmits: it's just something i never bothered to fix
 MSmits: it;s just a display thing
 MSmits: but hey, the theory
 AntiSquid: anyway p1 picks losing move so if it's stolen then opponent would put themselves in bad position, i am not entirely sure why it wouldn't pick something closer to the middle which favors a draw, hard mid is for win anything around mid is a draw
 MSmits: dont get distracted now
 MSmits: kk
 MSmits: AntiSquid except that may not be true for different sizes
 MSmits: just as the game is solved as a win for p2 with some sizes
 MSmits: i am not pretending i know why this is the case, just that it apparently is
 AntiSquid: in 7 col, it's mid after mid after mid, both players keep playing on top of each other to control the mid and then they play around mid stacking up to set traps, then they play side-ways to skip few turns until opponent gives in and plays mid basically going into the trap
 AntiSquid: MSmits i think odd column sizes play same way for most part
 MSmits: oh, I see
 MSmits: well my meta mcts says move 3 is best
 MSmits: not 4
 MSmits: not considering pie rule that is
 MSmits: but they're both winning i think
 MSmits: so maybe that doesnt matter
 MSmits: m:3 visits:430385 win:73,7% status:2m:4 visits:430384 win:67,4% status:2
 AntiSquid: ya with pie rule i was wondering if it plays on 3 as player 2 to restrict space, but doubt it
 MSmits: no idea really.
 MSmits: i dont have much domain knowledge in my bot either
 MSmits: just avoiding giving away wins is all
 MSmits: other than that it;s random rollout. Quite effective
 AntiSquid: i am not an expert, just generalizing based on what i observed 
 MSmits: yeah you probably know a lot more about it than i do
 AntiSquid: a lot more is a stretch
 MSmits: well i know almost nothing. I just know you dont want the opponent to have 3 in a row with both sides free and that you always need to block when therés a row of 3
 MSmits: thats the extend of my knowledge
 AntiSquid: but here's an important question imo: how often does your bot win by diagonals vs straight horizontal lines vs straight vertical ones?
 MSmits: extent
 therealbeef: just realized that there are two national holiday free days within the spring contest week :D
 MSmits: i dont think that is a meaninful question, because my bot does not control how it wins. 
 MSmits: the opponent controls how they lose
 MSmits: they solve 20 turns in advance
 MSmits: and they just give up 
 MSmits: in some way or other
 MSmits: could be anything
 AntiSquid: no, but when it plays itself with high depth search how does it end up winning&#160;?
 MSmits: it never wins
 MSmits: my bot only loses in random rollout
 MSmits: I dont do wincheck, i cancel all losing moves and if no moves are left, the bot loses
 jacek: is this a metaphor of life?
 AntiSquid: as p1 or p2&#160;?
 MSmits: never play the actual winning move
 AntiSquid: lol
 MSmits: i mean inthe random rollout, so both ways
 MSmits: depending on which player gets stuck first
 MSmits: it's kinda complicated, it uses simd
 MSmits: btw lol jacek
 MSmits: yeah i just looked at my sim in hopes i could form an explanation, but i think i would need to stare at it for 15 mins to understand it again =/
 MSmits: basically i get winningmoves for opponent and if i cant block em all i lose
 MSmits: well thats actually not that complicated
 MSmits: I could look at some games vs tric trac, seems to be my hardest opponent
 MSmits: my guess from quickly checking 10 games is 40% horizontal wins vs 60% diagonal. No vertical
 jacek: vertical can be easilyblocked
 MSmits: yeah i guess thats why
 jacek: only one side
 MSmits: hey, who starts in Othello?
 therealbeef: every direction can be as easily blocked, there are just a lot less vertical paths
 MSmits: black or white?
 jacek: black
 MSmits: ahhhh
 MSmits: my clobber sim is not bugged then, it just prints first board as black :P
 jacek: if you copied from othello then you want to check proper backpropagation as well
 MSmits: do you mean because of pass turns?
 jacek: eeyup
 jacek: i dont have pass move. i just have color in every node
 MSmits: I think i added pass turns as a separate node
 MSmits: node with same board
 MSmits: except it's flipped
 MSmits: I flip p1 and p2 on every turn
 MSmits: so that there's player symmetry
 MSmits: whomever's turn it is, is p1
 MSmits: then p1 can also use p2's nodes and statistics
 MSmits: more transpositions&#160;:)
 karliso: I don't get this... why 100ms for connect4?
 jacek: too low?
 MSmits: it's an arbitrary number really. You can play it with 1 ms, or with 10,000 ms and you still wont solve it
 MSmits: to conserve server, i guess it could have been lower
 jacek: well for chess we have 50ms and other more complicated games still 100ms
 MSmits: chess has more turns
 MSmits: limitation of sdk
 MSmits: langtons ant has 300 ms
 MSmits: i think
 karliso: I think it should have been as low as possible... just like in should have been in bandas.
 MSmits: bandas would have been a better game with less calc time. I completely agree
 MSmits: Connect4 has problems, but it's not the calc time
 MSmits: It's probably a problem that opening books will be too good
 MSmits: fixed start, low branching
 karliso: Yeah, I was for random first move.
 MSmits: in connect4&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 karliso: yes, at least a bit more opening depth
 MSmits: seems useless, there's only 5 unique moves
 MSmits: and only 1 or 2 are balanced starts
 MSmits: you'll be giving away the game if p1 starts with move 3 or 4
 MSmits: it's autowin almost
 MSmits: same balance as uttt center start
 MSmits: thats why we added the steal 
 karliso: If same is not bad...
 MSmits: what do you mean
 MSmits: you mean if it had swap?
 karliso: Like, Im 50%+ as balck except very top.
 karliso: so unbalanced is not problem
 MSmits: connect4 doesnt currently have swap though
 MSmits: it's just 1 game
 MSmits: so it would have had to play 2 games
 MSmits: with the sdk that takes some doing. re curse did it for chess960 and langtons ant has it too
 MSmits: but sure that would work ok
 MSmits: but it's pretty easy to just put a book in there for 5 starts
 MSmits: at least uttt has 15 unique openings
 MSmits: also uttt is not decided in first 20 moves. I dont know how it is for connect4
 MSmits: books could be much stronger there
 MSmits: basically, it wasnt added because we needed a strong competitive game. It's just for completeness. It's a classic game. It wasn't ever going to be a strong competitive game
 MSmits: dont think anyone spent more than a day or two on their bot
 karliso: For even more depth in c4 first player could have made first 2 moves as random.
 MSmits: that's a good suggestion
 MSmits: othello would have been better that way as well
 MSmits: karliso if you're interested, darkhorse64 made clobber
 MSmits: it starts with 112 moves
 karliso: what is that?
 MSmits: D&amp;B might also be good for you
 MSmits: sec

 MSmits: I am currently doing meta mcts, to see if 8x8 is complex enough. Otherwise it may become 10x10
 struct: I still had no time to test amazons&#160;:(
 struct: I still need to finish some stuff
 MSmits: me neither, but i really dont need to do a meta mcts for that
 MSmits: it's complex enough
 struct: and with random start
 jacek: how can you know?
 struct: is impossible
 MSmits: 1000 moves&#160;?
 MSmits: or something?/
 struct: MSmits I randomized starting positions
 jacek: thats a challenge
 MSmits: thats even crazier then struct. That wasnt even necessary :P
 struct: well it is 1000 moves in 10x10
 MSmits: but nothing wrong with that ofc
 struct: in 8x8 its smaller
 MSmits: ahh ok, still a ton
 jacek: its still over 1000 as first move
 jacek: and few hundered and few first moves
 MSmits: ok so karliso, amazons is great for you too then. It does exactly what you suggest
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 puzzles today, still bored... clobber huh
 MSmits: yeah come to clobber PatrickMcGinnisII, get clobbered
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, cannibalistic tower size variant sounds like a better challenge
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: 2nd move options in clobber:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bf113de6-9d21-48aa-9006-dd9441444a4a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bf113de6-9d21-48aa-9006-dd9441444a4a</a>
 jacek: not much symmetry eh
 MSmits: 1st move, only 28 options due to symmetry. Symmetry is completely broken after 1 move
 struct: you only use 1 core on the meta MSmits?
 MSmits: yeah i want to keep the rest running as well. so 6 of them now :P
 MSmits: if it gets too stressed, i will turn off yavalath or something
 struct: You do Yavalath just for fun right?
 MSmits: yeah i hope to some day maybe solve another move, though it doesnt seem likely
 MSmits: i think the other starts just go all the way to end game, no early solve
 dericeketli: alooooooo
 dericeketli: ses geliyor mu
 struct: english please
 dericeketli: ok.
 AntiSquid: salami
 dericeketli: Please talk to me
 AntiSquid: i just said hi
 MSmits: salami means hi?
 MSmits: maybe chefs say hi with food?
 MSmits: :confusion:
 MSmits: :confused:
 dericeketli: Please
 dericeketli: I speak ENGLİSH WELL
 AntiSquid: Salam (Arabic: سلام‎, salām), sometimes spelled salaam, is an Arabic word that literally means "peace", but is also used as a general greeting, MSmits, see&#160;?
 dericeketli: eL HABİBİ
 MSmits: ohh ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: at first glance, just looks like removing badmoves with a trits schema after 2 performing two moves should result in success
 AntiSquid: added the i for fun
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII what are you talking about
 PatrickMcGinnisII: clobber
 MSmits: I have no idea what you just said about clobber, but it did sound smart
 dericeketli: chat
 dericeketli: hey
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gotta cook ... don't have salami, but i got turkey sausage.. thanks AntiSquid, now I'm hungry
 dericeketli: hey man
 PatrickMcGinnisII: resembles D&amp;B, but simpler
 dericeketli: what s up man
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 dericeketli: aloo
 dericeketli: ses geliyor mu
 dericeketli: ses
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII it's both simpler and more complicated
 MSmits: in D&amp;B players both have the same options, in clobber it matters which pieces are yours
 AntiSquid: no spam 
 MSmits: i'll try
 AntiSquid: you said your english is great then engage in the conversation with the others
 AntiSquid: dericeketli
 jacek: sacre bleu
 jacek: karliso maybe some memes will convince you to connect4 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv">https://9gag.com/gag/aeDNdGv</a>
 MSmits: i love that one
 MSmits: sent it to my wife when you shared it the first time
 karliso: jacek I will need a long break after uttt. :D It will take time to muster up courage to start a new game.
 Boreal: op... optimization...
 Boreal: it... 
 Boreal: it... hurts...
 MadKnight: just use pragma o3
 Boreal: ..?
 MadKnight: it's a c++ thing
 Boreal: i...
 Boreal: i use c#
 MadKnight: oh they got something similar
 Boreal: I'm tryna do this thing
 Boreal: I need to get the min of a bunch of subarrays in decreasing size
 MadKnight: what do u mean by decreasing size
 Boreal: i.e. least of (1,3,4,9,8), (3,4,9,8), (4,9,8), (9,8), (8) into 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
 MadKnight: isn't it just basically sorted array
 Boreal: oh shit
 Boreal: it is
 Boreal: wait no
 MadKnight: then why does it end with 8, 9
 pardouin: last one is 8
 MadKnight: oh oke
 Boreal: (9,8,7,6,5) would output 5 5 5 5 5
 pardouin: got the link of the puzzle&#160;?
 MadKnight: then sorted array but instead of swapping u turn the bigger number into the smaller one
 Boreal: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/stock-exchange-losses">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/stock-exchange-losses</a>
 Boreal: easy enough, but it makes you optimize it to HELL
 MadKnight: just replace all the numbers on the left with the smaller number on the right
 MadKnight: ez
 MadKnight: 3,4,9,8,6 -&gt; 3,4,6,6,6
 MadKnight: perfect example of optimization to HELL
 Boreal: hmm
 pardouin: you only need to output one number
 MadKnight: just iterate once from right to left
 MadKnight: oh right lol
 MadKnight: u did it wrong
 pardouin: you can compute the max on the fly and the difference with the max on the fly
 MadKnight: yea u only need to iterate over the whole array once
 MadKnight: u don't even need to store all the values
 Boreal: ooh
 Boreal: Thank you my bruh
 Boreal: hey, there a way to do for loops that skip over nums?
 Boreal: oh nvm
 Boreal: wouldnt work anyways
 pardouin: usually there's a "continue" option to jump to the next one
 pardouin: but not needed here
 Boreal: oh wait here
 dericeketli: dfds
 dericeketli: dsfsdfsdıohfıos
 MadKnight: wat
 dericeketli: sorry
 dericeketli: please
 MadKnight: wat
 Boreal: nvm
 pardouin: the cat jumped on the keyboard&#160;?
 xloue: he is checking chat
 dericeketli: I need a friend
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 is available
 Automaton2000: it was a good one
 MadKnight: thanks Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: related to the real world
 Boreal: oh wait can i do n.EqualsIf(5, bool) or something
 MadKnight: what is that supposed to do
 Boreal: not store a number
 Boreal: for example
 MadKnight: wat
 Boreal: i'd needa do this
 Boreal: oh ok bye
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: trictrac, Konstant, update your Clobber bots!
 MSmits: Astrobytes, so far no clear winners, seems all random noise
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76100aa7-20fd-4ec7-bf09-5c285ef8f120">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76100aa7-20fd-4ec7-bf09-5c285ef8f120</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah I don't think you'll get useful results for a while in this one tbh
 MSmits: maybe never
 jacek: 1642 games, serious condifence
 jacek: (on purpose)
 MSmits: on uttt, center move jumps out after about this many games
 MSmits: maybe competing a bit with board corners
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 AntiSquid: no it's dropping&#160;! just when i got #1 lol
 AntiSquid: lame ...
 Astrobytes: Is the zero-penalty for used fuses working well?
 AntiSquid: i guess
 AntiSquid: i didn't really look at exact way others play still fixing my problems
 AntiSquid: and they probably fix theirs&#160;? meta is still evolving :O
 Astrobytes: hmm
 Astrobytes: jacek: what have you changed/are you changing on Oware?
 jacek: weights
 jacek: they seem better for others but meh for agade
 Astrobytes: Must Try Harder jacek.
 AntiSquid: shamefur this spray
 Astrobytes: *dispray
 MSmits: changing weights just means retraining doesnt it?
 Astrobytes: Educated guess says yes
 Maxmars: I'm trying the descent in C++ I have succeeded with all test case but all sequentially how do you test all test cases and submit
 struct: there should buttons for that
 Astrobytes: Press Submit?
 struct: at the bottom right
 Astrobytes: oh hey struct
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Been busy?
 Maxmars: I just dont understand how to play all the test cases one after another...  Sorry newby
 ejpon: I'd recommend the "Play all testcases" button
 ejpon: but if any fails, the next tests won't start
 Maxmars: Ya but it doesnt work  I have put all my cout statements one after another for all test case
 Maxmars: Is that how you should do it
 ejpon: huh
 ejpon: I'm afraid I don't understand your issue
 Astrobytes: No Maxmars
 Maxmars:&#160;???
 Astrobytes: You are hard-coding the answers for each test case.
 Astrobytes: Your solution should be able to solve the problem given any set of inputs within the given constraints.
 Astrobytes: So you need to generalise whatever you do to pass the individual testcases.
 Maxmars:&#160;!!!ok... newbie... my mistake...
 kovi: top3 is pretty close 0.01 between
 Astrobytes: Also note that the validators when you submit are slightly different from the testcases, to stop hardcoding answers.
 AntiSquid: the 1st used to be at 33, now it's a flat 30 :D
 Astrobytes: Is there much to improve? Ways to improve?
 AntiSquid: idk
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: feels like some improvements backfire
 Astrobytes: Does it depend on the number of high skilled bots in the league?
 AntiSquid: i'd be #1 if i knew that
 Astrobytes: Run locally with different versions
 AntiSquid: every submit someone gets dropped from #1 :P
 AntiSquid: there's also a lot of luck involved
 Astrobytes: That sounds like any other multi that no one has any particular advantage on at the top
 AntiSquid: starting hands and when you draw the required cards for example
 AntiSquid: i keep telling myself i take a break and do a proper rewrite after next submit
 Astrobytes: You do that with every game :P
 Astrobytes: (that you're actively playing I mean)
 Astrobytes: field3: Clobber inputs have changed. Need to update your program.
 AntiSquid: woah a powerful start :o almost
 MSmits: come get clobbered AntiSquid&#160;:)
 kovi: sorry
 AntiSquid: it's ok
 MSmits: you still on fireworks?
 AntiSquid: i dropped you from 1, so i understand you want to take your revenge lol
 AntiSquid: damn he wins almost every time 
 Astrobytes: Everyone is on fireworks rn it seems MSmits
 AntiSquid: ya 3 people active lol
 Notgoodatcoding5: hi
 AntiSquid: this time i am doing something right, not one single 4th place so far&#160;! :o
 AntiSquid: ah there it goes, i jinxed it again
 AntiSquid: someone drop kov i, he went to sleep
 Imsure1200q: i have encountered one of the most confusing reverse mode 
 Imsure1200q:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: I've never seen dimulien (3rd on fw) online, wow, he came out of nowhere
 therealbeef: maybe very different timezone
 MYBK: Hi everybody, Can anyone orients me to a simple problem I can solve using Genetic algorithm, please&#160;? I don't think learning GA with coders strike back is a good idea for a beginner in the field  
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: it's like that with a few users here and there, field 3 you only see at some times for instance
 Astrobytes: (Japan)
 AntiSquid: he's been top 5 all day at least today, even 1st Wontonimo
 therealbeef: MYBK, maybe first try it on an optimization problem or puzzle then. GA in multiplayer is tricky because of the uncertainty of what the opponent is going to do
 MYBK: yes I believe that also, especially I had some basic knowledge about neural network and q-learning, At this point in time I believe GA is a lot different than them, that's why I was too confused   
 MYBK: Thank you
 MYBK: pss: how do you mention someone in the conversation? like you have done it with red color&#160;?  
 therealbeef: just type their name&#160;:)
 therealbeef: anywhere in the text
 MYBK: thank you therealbeef
 therealbeef: there's a user named struct, he gets red-spammed a lot&#160;;)
 MYBK: like that&#160;? 
 therealbeef: yep
 MYBK: cool, thank you, the messaging system in CG, makes me remember World of Warcraft messaging system, there is some similarity on it
 AntiSquid: is use struct instead of class
 MYBK: emm he may prefer using c language over other languages :p 
 Devinawesley: I just got humbled by a clash. Was one of those reverse ones and I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. Rip in salami
 StepBack13: server lag?
 Michael_48: oi me chum
 Michael_48: how about we sail the seven seas

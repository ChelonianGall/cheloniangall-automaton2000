 cegprakash: I timeout on last testacase for the resistance problem :P
 eulerscheZahl: a cegprakash :ohaven't seen you in ages
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: a wild cegprakash appears
 cegprakash: with find function I got 8 testcases passed 
 cegprakash: with substr I got 9 testcases passed
 cegprakash: 10th test case seems hard
 eulerscheZahl: do you use any kind of dynamic programming approach?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/esCMbD">https://ideone.com/esCMbD</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a char-wise comparison is probably more efficient than your substring approach
 cegprakash: but gotta go by word by word anyway
 cegprakash: and jump to word length anyway
 eulerscheZahl: or build your whole valid encodings as a tree so you don't have to test each of the separately
 cegprakash: I think the problem is with substr 
 eulerscheZahl: with the char-by-char you could avoid substring
 eulerscheZahl: early exit...
 cegprakash: I see
 cegprakash: let me add an inner loop
 eulerscheZahl: if it isn't fast enough: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/telephone-numbers">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/telephone-numbers</a>save your letters in a tree

 proogrmr: yeh&#160;:)
 jiligualabajibaji: Very nice to see you.I can learn much(including English).:grin:
 Metanoob: jiligualabajibaji I wish I could help more... What language are you coding in? maybe you could share with me in a private message a link to a pastebin or similar place to review code?
 Metanoob: Not sure if that's ok with CG policy, is that ok  @here?
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like he's still in wood, nothing advanced in that bot. then it's ok to just paste the full code here in the chat
 jiligualabajibaji: @Metanoob let me try
 Metanoob: ah awesome then, thanks
 Metanoob: you can also share link here if you want jiligualabajibaji
 eulerscheZahl: just paste the code directly, it will turn into a pastebin
 Metanoob: aaah, damn - sorry for my ignorance, good to know
 jacek: oO
 Metanoob: Apparently everything is okay now have fun coding jiligualabajibaji&#160;:)
 proogrmr: why there is lot of string problems(ascii is that called like that) in clash of code 
 eulerscheZahl: because many creators thought it would be a fun and original idea

 Metanoob: i have another community uneducated question, is it okay to ask for technical knowledge advice non related to puzzles? My guess is: not in "World" but maybe somewhere else?
 Metanoob: forums/categories &gt; General
 JBM: here is fine
 eulerscheZahl: it's ok to ask here
 Metanoob: ah cool
 eulerscheZahl: might get ignored if the chat is busy and not the right users are reading it at that time. you can still place it in the forum or ask again
 Astrobytes: Or ask on the discord
 eulerscheZahl: so many channels
 Astrobytes: Deciding whether your query lies within 'general' or 'anything'...
 <b>**eulerscheZahl muted the anything channel</b></p><p><img src="/a/56540389171596" /> Metanoob: yep makes sense, let's try here - anyone familiar with iptables transparent proxy capabilities?
 Metanoob: haha
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's a very specific topic
 eulerscheZahl: i miss ifconfig and can't even remember the iptables command to get the IP of my router
 eulerscheZahl: so i abuse tracepath :P
 JBM: there's an iptables command for that?!
 Metanoob: haha nice
 Metanoob: yeah i didnt know that either JBM
 Metanoob: i usually use ip addr
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's handy
 Metanoob: yeah proved itself useful more than once
 Metanoob: basically i'm trying to avoid having to use NAT (because it has to temper with the packets back and forth) to redirect a packet to its original destination (SO_ORIGINAL_DEST) 
 eulerscheZahl: your problem might be too specific to find help in the CG community even
 Metanoob: yeah i guess it's not so much about algorithm and more about low level network and tools

 eulerscheZahl: more precisely: it updates when I start my computer
 eulerscheZahl: I think I should index my database, searches are slow&#160;:(
 Ragi: I found what I wanted so thanks a lot&#160;:-)
 k4ng0u: eulerscheZahl, you might want to change the background color of the search input. It's barely visible due to the contrast with the background of the page :p

 MSmits: lol
 struct: MSmits how much time has your meta been running for?
 MSmits: hmm, not sure, maybe 70 hours or so?
 MSmits: between 70 and 100
 MSmits: it speeds up a bit as the tree goes deeper
 MSmits: shorter games (till solve)
 MSmits: games probably end at between ply 30 and 40
 jacek: so ill be back in 1 year and see if its solved
 MSmits: some games now start at ply 12 or so
 MSmits: i have no idea if this could lead to a solve realistically
 MSmits: kinda happy move 0 is at 52% though. Even if this game is not solved as a draw, there is at least a move that is pretty much balanced
 MSmits: because even if one side is favorited, it needs A LOT of calculation time to find the advantage
 MSmits: otherwise i would have already
 reCurse: What game is that?
 struct: connect 4
 struct: on 7x9?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: it's not solved
 MSmits: but almost
 MSmits: (in science I mean)
 MSmits: 8x8 is solved and everything smaller
 MSmits: 9x7 would seem smaller, less cells, but because its width is 9, you have more branching throughout the game
 MSmits: same braching as uttt, mostly
 MSmits: except games can end early, which makes it an easier to solve game
 MSmits: oh and it has way more transpositions than uttt of course
 MSmits: uttt barely has any
 reCurse: It has a lot of transpositions actually?
 reCurse: More than connect4 I would assume
 MSmits: hmm well, not in the first 20 or so plies
 MSmits: because you keep jumping to different boards
 reCurse: Yeah but you get way more symmetries
 MSmits: thats just a single factor of 8
 reCurse:&#160;???
 MSmits: in the number of states
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: there are 8 symmetry states
 reCurse: Every position has 8 symmetries...
 MSmits: yes
 reCurse: That's a lot of transpositions
 MSmits: so factor of 8
 reCurse: How is connect 4 having more transpositions with two symmetries
 MSmits: what i mean is, the total number of dinstinct states can be divided by 8
 MSmits: because i am tlaking about a totally different kind of transposition
 MSmits: not a symmetry one
 MSmits: it's making move A, then B, then C instead ofmaking move C, then B, then A
 MSmits: uttt has none of that in ply 1 -20
 MSmits: connect 4 has tons
 MSmits: and this is way more consequential
 reCurse: For meta mcts it doesn't matter
 MSmits: why not
 MSmits: i have had it matter so often in yavalath
 reCurse: Because it's the number of unique states that matter
 MSmits: it has these transpositions as well
 MSmits: exactly
 reCurse: So in that sense transposition is by how much you can diminish it
 reCurse: So uttt has way more
 MSmits: I think we have to distinguish game tree complexity from state space complexity
 MSmits: my way of looking at transpositions reduces game tree complexity
 MSmits: your way reduces state space complexity
 reCurse: Does game tree complexity matter?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: you dont actually visit every possible state to solve a game
 reCurse: I don't think it does
 reCurse: All you keep is a set of open states right? Doesn't matter how you got there
 MSmits: from yavalath i often got to a new node in my tree and noticed I already had 30k visits there, and i got there from a different starting move
 MSmits: saved a lot of time, symmetry is already excluded from the start mostly
 MSmits: most states are inconsequential
 MSmits: they are never visited as no good bot will visit them
 reCurse: I said open states
 reCurse: Not all states obviously
 MSmits: yes, but if you look at state space as a pure measure of how hard it is to solve a game, you are missing some important bits
 MSmits: pun not intended
 MSmits: for example
 reCurse: I disagree but I fail to formalize it
 MSmits: you need only 1 winning move
 MSmits: to finish a node
 MSmits: so if most moves are crap, you dont even need to look at those states
 reCurse: The symmetry indirectly reduces the game tree complexity massively
 MSmits: but it is by a constant factor
 MSmits: not by an order of magnitude
 MSmits: or orders
 MSmits: exponentially, like branching does in a game tree
 MSmits: you will only ever need 8x as much time to solve a game, if it has symmetry like uttt
 MSmits: and you disregard the symmetry
 MSmits: you will need millions of times more time if you try to solve connect 4 without using tranpositions from order of moves
 reCurse: That doesn't sound right
 MSmits: symmetry almost exclusively happens in move 1 and 2
 reCurse: No that's wrong
 reCurse: I actually did it
 reCurse: The meta mcts on uttt
 reCurse: There's way more than that
 MSmits: allright, move 1, you play 44, i assume
 MSmits: then there's 2 chocies
 MSmits: instead of 8
 MSmits: factor of 4
 MSmits: then second turn, you have about half as many choices because of symmetry
 MSmits: factor of 2
 MSmits: 2 * 8 = 16
 MSmits: 2 * 4 = 8 sry
 MSmits: blacking out here :P
 MSmits: other than that, all the other transpositions all come from this  directly or indirectly
 Zenoscave: finally got my mcts working for breakthrough just need to optim and work on opening book
 reCurse: Like I said I'm failing to formalize it
 reCurse: But when running it symmetries kept happening
 reCurse: So something is missing in your logic
 MSmits: of course they keep happening
 MSmits: i dont mean you have 15 less nodes
 MSmits: i mean you have millions less
 reCurse: At every depth there's symmetries
 MSmits: but thats still a factor of 8
 reCurse: From the reduced set
 MSmits: yea, but they come from the top
 reCurse: No...
 Zenoscave: 7/8*7/8*7/8
 Zenoscave:&#160;!= 7/8
 reCurse: I already eliminated the moves at the top
 MSmits: symmetry doesnt reduce branching 
 reCurse: If it was true then symmetries would have stopped
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: those arent symmetries!
 MSmits: those are transposition
 reCurse: And we were talking about transpositions...
 Zenoscave: :popcorn:
 MSmits: i mean those are transpositions coming from arrivign at the same state due to different move orders
 MSmits: thats not from rotation and mirror
 reCurse: You said there's nothing between move 2
 reCurse: Yes it is
 reCurse: The transposition is calculated from applying 8 symmetries
 reCurse: And checking if it's already there
 MSmits: it's really negligible though, i eliminated those top symmetries as well
 MSmits: and I ran about 3 million games
 reCurse: But it's not negligible that's what I'm killing myself to say
 MSmits: 2% of parent nodes were transposed
 reCurse: Every expansion is checked against a massive hash table
 reCurse: And nodes were duplicated all the time
 MSmits: yes, thats how i do it too
 MSmits: every parent node is hashed
 reCurse: Not just from the top
 MSmits: i know
 reCurse: So again
 reCurse: How does that make it less transposed than connect 4
 MSmits: every node is hashed on expansion
 reCurse: Which only has 2 symmetries
 Zenoscave: I figured out bash (and i assume other langs) have fs access
 MSmits: because a symmetry transpositon is not the same as a move order transposition
 jacek: i think you both have different definition of transposition
 MSmits: i can get to the same connect 4 state  in 3 plies
 Astrobytes: Is this you two saying the same thing differently again?
 MSmits: in 2 different ways
 Zenoscave: take a guess Astrobytes
 MSmits: try that with utt if you're not at the top
 MSmits: a really short 3 move transposition
 jacek: one speaks dutch english, the other canadian english
 MSmits: wont work in uttt
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: lol, so what about fs access?
 reCurse: They are just of a longer length
 reCurse: Number of ways to do teccles opening for example
 MSmits: but that is extremely important 
 Zenoscave: cat &lt;&lt; EOF | base64 --decode | tar -x --lzma -vf &gt;&amp;2 -
 MSmits: the shorter the transposition length, the more often they reduce the game tree complexity = branching
 reCurse: vs number of expansions
 reCurse: I'm sure this number is way higher for uttt
 MSmits: it was extremely low for me
 MSmits: 2% or less, after removing symmetry states at the top
 MSmits: i counted
 reCurse: That makes no sense
 MSmits: had a special button for it even
 jacek: i think MSmits says only about move order transpositions, while reCurse says about how much you can reduce the game into unique states
 MSmits: correct jacek
 reCurse: Well sure if you reduce the definition to a specific thing
 reCurse: I only care about how it affects the end result
 reCurse: Doesn't matter the source
 MSmits: the end result is how hard it is to solve a game
 MSmits: the move order transpositions are way more important
 reCurse: Exactly, so talking about specifics like move order transpositions is not that helpful
 reCurse: All you care about is how much you hit vs how much you have to expand
 MSmits: but you have to expand far less. Every time you hit a mov eorder transposition, you dont expand
 MSmits: in uttt, it's *9 every time almost, for example with teccles
 reCurse: Every time you hit *any* transposition
 MSmits: if you try teccles in every possible order, you will still almost never hit one you already found before, I did 50,000 teccles games and i did not find a single identical one
 MSmits: for the first 16 plies or so i mean
 MSmits: because the jumping to fresh boards in combination with the "next board variable" makes states  very unique
 MSmits: in 16 plies, i can reduce the connect4 tree by thousands, maybe millions
 MSmits: a factor of
 MSmits: due to move orders
 MSmits: as you say, by hashing all states
 MSmits: btw, for the C# + windows form enthousiasts. I use Persistent Dictionary. Great way  to hash very simple structures if you dont know how to write your own database and such
 MSmits: I know with c++ there's easier ways
 reCurse: It's unfortunate I don't have my meta mcts figures anymore, because your 2% is way off for uttt
 MSmits: well i did not include top symmetry
 MSmits: if you turn those off, you will be bombarded by transpositions
 reCurse: How can it be affected by top symmetry if those nodes are never expanded
 MSmits: in your case you mean
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: then it cant be affected
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: well i will tell you what i did to get to the 2%
 reCurse: And I had way more than 2%
 MSmits: I ran through all my parent nodes
 MSmits: and checked if they had the same children as another parent node
 MSmits: (this was when i hashed the childindex, so parents were duplicated)
 Zenoscave: MSmits how many opening book entries can you fit in your bots?
 MSmits: i just divided the total number of times this happened, by the total number of nodes
 MSmits: hmm
 Zenoscave: on CG
 MSmits: i realize now this might cause an error of a facotr of 9, because i didnt divide by the total number of parents, but by total nodes
 MSmits: so it could be 18%
 MSmits: does that fit better?
 MSmits: Zenoscave depends on game
 MSmits: some about 100k, some about 300k moves
 Zenoscave: breaktrhough
 reCurse: I don't have the exact figures
 reCurse: Like I said
 reCurse: But at least 20% sounds about right
 Zenoscave: HOW SO MANY what is in each entry
 Zenoscave: hash bytes and win/games?
 MSmits: for connect 4 it would be way more than that, almost every node would be reachable by many ways
 MSmits: Zenoscave there's tricks to storing these moves efficiently
 MSmits: you dont store the gamestates
 MSmits: you store the tree
 MSmits: and you skip transposed branches
 Zenoscave: so like a move tree?
 MSmits: yes
 Zenoscave: skip index list
 MSmits: like this { 4 { 2}  5 { 1} {6 { 5 { 4 } } }  } 
 MSmits: { means go deeper, } means go up
 MSmits: first move is always best
 Zenoscave: ... brilliant
 MSmits: 2nd move is an opponent move you counter
 Zenoscave: do you store this in a string in source?
 MSmits: you store the tree, then recreate the flow of the game, while reading the string
 MSmits: and store it in a real hashtable
 MSmits: yeah
 Zenoscave: smart. I bet I can help you reach 500K entries 
 MSmits: i never had more than 2-3k
 MSmits: entries
 Zenoscave: i thought you said 100K
 MSmits: thats how many fit
 MSmits: thats not how many i have in my bots
 MSmits: so thats why i never worry about running out of space
 Zenoscave: ah. 
 MSmits: i dont even unicode compress
 MSmits: and i use space separation
 MSmits: which basically doubles my space
 MSmits: it doesnt really matter
 MSmits: if i ever need to, i will compress it
 Zenoscave: Gotcha
 MSmits: the reason i dont need to is that it takes months to calculate a book with even 1k moves in them
 VizGhar: hmm maybe question for google, but what is "unicode compress" and how can I make use of it?
 MSmits: well, on 1 core that is
 Zenoscave: whats your qbf_k value? .55?
 MSmits: dont know what that is Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: cut off win rate to keep in book
 MSmits: VizGhar a unicode character consists of 2 bytes give or take (it varies) , so thats how much information fits i there
 reCurse: There's nothing to google as it is uniquely applicable to circumvent CG's limitations
 MSmits: Zenoscave i dont think i do it quite that way
 MSmits: not like the papers tell me
 Zenoscave: do you store the whole tree of sims?
 MSmits: i just include the move in the book if the node was visited a minimum number of times
 MSmits: 1 sim is 1 game
 MSmits: so it takes between 1 and 6 seconds usually
 MSmits: easily stored on HD
 MSmits: not the whole game, just the result from that node, the tree is expanded by 1
 Zenoscave: ah. I do both. only include if it wins at least 55% of games. and if I have at least 50 games
 Zenoscave: for that node
 MSmits: for yavalath i have at least 10k games
 MSmits: it takes like a full day for 1 move :P
 Zenoscave: lol
 struct: you test vs players in arena right?
 Zenoscave: how many games of yavalath do you play a day?
 MSmits: i force the search down moves that are done by arena players yes
 MSmits: but not exclusively
 jacek: have you considered buying yavalath board
 MSmits: Zenoscave none currently, i dont have it on. 
 Zenoscave: 10M on breakthrough took my bot an 1h
 MSmits: but it's 30 ms per move i think?
 MSmits: most games are solved
 MSmits: well.. about half
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 MSmits: so i guess 1 second per game roughly
 MSmits: yavalath is a weird game
 Zenoscave: Well My opening book is about to get much better
 Zenoscave: thanks&#160;!!!!!
 MSmits: Zenoscave which game&#160;?
 jacek: 10M random rollouts?
 MSmits: oh right bt
 Zenoscave: 10M full games
 Zenoscave: from trun 0 to game over
 MSmits: but those are random games?
 Zenoscave: yes
 Zenoscave: default policy is pure random
 Zenoscave: no minimax default yet
 MSmits: when i do meta mcts, a game is actually a real game with a bot, so every move has thousands of rollouts
 MSmits: so 1 of those 1 second games has millions of sims
 MSmits: so when i put an opening book in, it will have over 1 billion sims
 MSmits: per move
 Zenoscave: and you just discard the entire inner mcts info or up-propogate
 MSmits: i discard it, but i am guessing i should maybe take the whole move tree that was used
 MSmits: but i might bloat my meta mcts tree then
 Zenoscave: Might be a slight improvement
 MSmits: yeah maybe, but currently it sits at 600 mb or so
 MSmits: on HD
 Zenoscave: jesus
 MSmits: i dont want it to be 10 gb
 Zenoscave: Are you on an HDD or solid state?
 MSmits: this is solid state
 MSmits: otherwise it would be really slow 
 Zenoscave: gotcha. dedicated to OS or is it a second drive? I don't see the folly in a 10gb tree
 Zenoscave: time to reload or populate?
 MSmits: there's no folly in it currently, but i have 6 of those meta mcts, if they all become 10gb... well i guess that would still be ok
 MSmits: reload&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: when i turn on the program it runs instantly, hash is on HD
 Zenoscave: read the tree into the program for running
 MSmits: Persistent dictionary
 Zenoscave: gotcha
 Zenoscave: text based?
 MSmits: it's probably serialized to some form of text. It's pretty compact i think
 MSmits: a single node in my case has 128 bit keys and 128 bit values
 MSmits: + whatever overhead the dictionary has
 Astrobytes: You didn't end up serializing to bin?
 MSmits: no that was for endgame books
 jacek: hmm bt has one symmetry
 Astrobytes: Ah ok
 MSmits:  believe it or not
 MSmits:  I use Guid
 MSmits: it's some kind of web thingy?
 MSmits: it's 128 bit, so i use it as my type to store in
 MSmits: persistent dictionary supports it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/microsoft/ManagedEsent/blob/master/Documentation/PersistentDictionaryDocumentation.md">https://github.com/microsoft/ManagedEsent/blob/master/Documentation/PersistentDictionaryDocumentation.md</a>
 MSmits: it's a package you import in VS and it works immediately, it's exactly like using a normal dictionary. Pretty amazing stuff
 MSmits: except you're restricted in what types you can use
 MSmits: about as fast as a normal DB except you dont need to know anything about databases
 MSmits: I just start up my meta mcts and i can click if away like any windows program and the dictionary will properly save itself so nothing is corrupted
 MSmits: 2 GB items max
 MSmits: 2 billion i mean sry
 MSmits: did i just help Zenoscave counter your bot jacek
 Zenoscave: probably&#160;;)
 MSmits: just realized that, sorry
 jacek: :c
 MSmits: hey, i'll teach you a trick to take back othello if you want jacek, i'll pm
 Zenoscave: jacek I have a ways to go before i can counter your breakthrough
 Zenoscave: my current mcts would probably rank around 50
 jacek: and your current bot isnt mcts?
 Zenoscave: Minimax only
 Zenoscave: just depth 5
 jacek: well books can be used for any bot
 Zenoscave: true... might add the book to my minimax. Didn't think of that
 Zenoscave: thanks!!!
 jacek: have you considered testing the 'usual' opening formation for the first 12 moves?
 Zenoscave: nope. I don't look at other bots or active games really
 Zenoscave: I'll try that too
 Zenoscave: thanks
 jacek: i meant from the creator(?) paper
 Zenoscave: there's a paper?
 jacek: page 4 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.trmph.com/bin/Basic_Introduction_to_Breakthrough.pdf">http://www.trmph.com/bin/Basic_Introduction_to_Breakthrough.pdf</a>
 MSmits: Zenoscave you can also use meta mcts with a minimax bot as the bot that plays the games
 MSmits: all that matters is that the games give results on who won or lost
 MSmits: doesnt matter what type of AI is playing the game
 MSmits: could use NN to play the game 
 MSmits: generally it's considered best to use the bot that is eventually going to use the book as well
 Zenoscave: oh man i've got loads of todos now
 MSmits: because then it knows what to do with the moves it's given
 MSmits: take it slow. I started over, tons of times, adding some features along the way
 Zenoscave: I'm thinking meta-mcts is my next one
 Zenoscave: then better opening book serialization
 jacek: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/ouvertures9x9.pdf">https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/ouvertures9x9.pdf</a>
 Zenoscave: Yeah similar but not as complex at first
 Zenoscave: just replacing default policy for rollout is my first attempt
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah :P
 zhoubou: I can't understand strategy laid out in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/code-vs-zombies-feedback-strategies/1089/37">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/code-vs-zombies-feedback-strategies/1089/37</a> . Why would I move randomly up to 3 times, only to move toward zombies 1 by 1 afterwards? What do random movements before following add?
 struct: well if you move randomly 10 times and kill instantly and you get same score
 struct: the solution is equally good
 struct: like chess a forced mate in 10 is equally as good as a forced mate in 1
 zhoubou: Hmm. I think I see where you are heading, but I'm not understanding it. Maybe I need some thinking on that.
 zhoubou: Some more*
 zhoubou: Your wording seems to contradict the strategy to me
 zhoubou: Like you are saying it's better to just have random moves instead of going toward zombies.
 struct: it doesnt matter
 struct: ok I guess you can do both
 struct: choose random move or go toward zombie
 zhoubou: That's what strategy lays out
 zhoubou: But I think either one or the other
 Astrobytes: *or go toward random zombie
 zhoubou: Yeah, random zombie
 Astrobytes: It's just a flat monte carlo
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/520549213">https://www.codingame.com/replay/520549213</a>
 struct: for example here
 struct: if i dont group them at the end
 struct: the  score would be lower
 zhoubou: Ohh
 zhoubou: I think I get it!
 zhoubou: Wow, thanks.
 zhoubou: So add some randomness to accidentally stumble upon a combo and otherwise just go toward zombies.
 Astrobytes: and tweak your parameters/spam until it's nice 
 struct: well the randomness will go towards a zombie eventually
 struct: So I never bothered adding go to zombie
 zhoubou: Well, that's my original question
 zhoubou: Why add going to zombies
 Astrobytes: Yeah, just random moves is enough
 zhoubou: Ok, awesome
 Astrobytes: Don't get too hung up on PMs
 zhoubou: What's PM?
 Astrobytes: Sorry, post-mortems
 struct: Also top solutions are probably hardcoded
 Astrobytes: Post contest reports
 struct: at least mine is
 struct: max I got was 650~k points without hardcoding
 zhoubou: Astrobytes Oh ok. I learn something every day I guess :P
 zhoubou: struct Interesting
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/cvz.txt">https://github.com/dbdr/codingame-validators/blob/master/cvz.txt</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah zhoubou, you learn some terminology along the way
 zhoubou: Yeah, I've got a tiny bit of it under my belt already
 zhoubou: struct Those are real validators?
 VizGhar: zhoubou asking right questions&#160;:)
 struct: yes
 Astrobytes: yes
 zhoubou: Huh
 struct: Also your bot needs to be able to do this
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/520550378">https://www.codingame.com/replay/520550378</a>
 zhoubou: VizGhar I am? :P
 VizGhar: If you learn something new, then most probably yes&#160;;)
 zhoubou: Hehe
 zhoubou: struct That's incredible. But that's 20 depth
 zhoubou: I didn't even start implementing anything, just simulated one turn score
 zhoubou: "simulated" -&gt; computed
 struct: I simulate until the end yes
 struct: I found that solution on turn 10
 struct: or a similar one
 struct: I found 464210 score one
 VizGhar: start with 1 depth (simulate 1 turn) and apply some evaluation function and voila. 1 step closer to perfect bot
 struct: but then I replaced it with a better one after
 zhoubou: struct Amazing.
 zhoubou: VizGhar Awesome, thank you very much :D
 zhoubou: I started this site without knowing how to implement a graph. I might be heading somewhere
 zhoubou: With the help of you guys of course
 Astrobytes: For sure. You can learn a lot, the site won't teach you but you're forced to go and learn/ask questions
 VizGhar: (I haven't done any work on that puzzle yet, but small steps are necessary for us beginners)
 zhoubou: Astrobytes Yes, the competition and curiosity motivate you, which is great.&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Exactly&#160;:)
 zhoubou: VizGhar I appreciate the pointing in the right direction and reassurance
 Astrobytes: Even if you only compete with yourself, ie. try to improve, it's worthwhile
 zhoubou: Yeah. I've been dabbling with programming for years without much improvement
 zhoubou: I lacked motivation.
 zhoubou: This site might change it all :D
 VizGhar: I'm looking forward for next contest. I already took free may so that I can attend the competition (+ some ultramarathon)
 zhoubou: Oh, I would love to participate too!
 zhoubou: I just need to beef up my skills until then
 zhoubou: But idk if I will have the free time I have now (I'm sick currently)
 Astrobytes: Doesn't matter how far you get in your first contest (or any, depending on your motivation/goal) as long as you have fun
 VizGhar: So... get sick in may :D
 zhoubou: Astrobytes You're absolutely right
 zhoubou: VizGhar :rofl:
 Astrobytes: And plenty of us work full time and put in extra time in the evenings/days for contests
 VizGhar: ++
 zhoubou: Oh I see
 Astrobytes: I mean, I don't just sit on my ass and watch CG chat for 12 hours lol
 MSmits: nah it's more than that, you sleep for only 8 hours right?
 Astrobytes: Gotta make the time&#160;;)
 MSmits: :P
 zhoubou: Hmm when you mention that
 Astrobytes: Yeah but I usually do some stuff in the morning before logging in
 zhoubou: I could do this at work incognito
 MSmits: oh ok
 zhoubou: I usually complete so many things they think I always work, even when I go for a break
 Astrobytes: If you're ahead in your work sure
 MSmits: i have something similar like that
 zhoubou: Astrobytes Yeah, I think I am, most of times
 MSmits: I'm pretty much the only one doing automated stuff at work, mostly with macros and such
 MSmits: so they think i do a huge  load of work and it took me 15 mins
 reCurse: Any manager worth their salt knows you don't get 8 productive hours a day
 MSmits: i even tell them, as you probably know... i cant lie
 Astrobytes: Really? I thought more would be doing the timesaving stuff MSmits
 MSmits: but they dont believe me :P
 zhoubou: MSmits I do something like that regularly, yeah
 reCurse: At least not for non-physical work
 MSmits: they are teachers, not coders
 MSmits: thats so true reCurse
 zhoubou: reCurse You're absolutely right
 Astrobytes: Don't need to be much of a coder for macros and such MSmits
 zhoubou: Shhh
 MSmits: i know, but you do need to have some knowledge
 zhoubou: :P
 MSmits: these are not IT teachers
 MSmits: they teach language, art etc.
 Astrobytes: If they can do numbers they can probably automate excel etc
 Astrobytes: Oh right
 MSmits: so i tell them, it's automated, i press a button and mail you the result
 VizGhar: they are using pen and paper, you kmow :D
 MSmits: they just think i work all day to get it done
 MSmits: well I guess it paints me in a positive light
 Astrobytes: And yes, 100% reCurse
 MSmits: i just hate that visual basic for applications that you use in excel
 MSmits: horrible language
 zhoubou: I agree
 Astrobytes: VBA is highly unpleasant, yes.
 VizGhar: yeez... somebody has to stop those contributions... unbelieveable
 MSmits: the amount or the quality?
 Astrobytes: How many now?
 reCurse: Yes
 VizGhar: both
 Valdez001: hello
 Astrobytes: hi
 Astrobytes: It's getting ridiculous in the Contribs section now, it's so hard to find multis and puzzles in amongst the clash drek.
 MSmits: there needs to be a multi filter
 MSmits: can only click clash and puzzle
 VizGhar: 121 pending
 Astrobytes: Oh it's gone down a little at least.
 Astrobytes: Good stuff is overlooked/missed because of all the generic clashes
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgflip.com/i/4sz010">https://imgflip.com/i/4sz010</a>
 Astrobytes: Was it you, reCurse, that warned of a similar situation at the introduction of the quest map?
 reCurse: Not sure if it was just me but yes definitely
 reCurse: Very easy to map consequences from incentives
 reCurse: But hey it got more engagement
 reCurse: Woo
 reCurse: Marketing will be happy
 MSmits: well for example, i like tric trac's firework game at first glance. It's good variety. But I don't have the time to get into it. Wish someone else would 
 MSmits: antisquid did, but not many others
 Astrobytes: Quantity over quality as per.
 Astrobytes: I will try it soon MSmits.
 MSmits: cool 
 Astrobytes: So damn much to catch up on.
 MSmits: yep yep
 MSmits: something funny happened to me today
 MSmits: I was teaching all day online
 MSmits: then at the end of my day i was in a meeting with out highest manager
 MSmits: (boss of 5 school buildings)
 MSmits: i forgot to turn off my google meet
 MSmits: with my class
 MSmits: and one student had apparently disconnected and reappeared half an hour after the class ended
 MSmits: during my meeting
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 MSmits: so he was suddenly talking really loudly in my ear during this meeting
 Astrobytes: Could the manager hear it?
 Astrobytes: Or it was totally separate
 MSmits: didnt give him a chance, i just said, sorry i have to talk to this student 
 MSmits: he would have heard prolly
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: i also had 2 students that wanted a separate meet so they could cooperate quietly
 Astrobytes: Politicians get fired for such things. Always mute/close the required channels
 MSmits: then they invited me to check if they were working
 MSmits: and the passcode was poop
 MSmits: these are 16 yr olds
 MSmits: fyi :P
 zhoubou: Just wanted to ask :rofl:
 Astrobytes: At 16 my passcode would have been a lot worse than 'poop'. Were they working?
 reCurse: I've come to expect worse from adults so nothing surprising here
 MSmits: Astrobytes yeah it was right after the class, i even forgot i had a meeting. I was 10 mins late lol.. students kept asking me questions
 MSmits: they were drawing stuff with python turtle using code
 MSmits: sir, my tree is lopsided, how to fix?
 Angecide: Hi, I was reading ur post on optimizing bfs the other day and I really liked your idea about class-less nodes, and I was wondering if you think it would be possible to apply the idea in mcts as well? I thought about this a lot and the the biggest challenge I see is; how to keep track of all the child nodes (assuming there could be more than 30 child nodes at some point)? Maybe you have a solution for this?
 reCurse: Contiguous allocation
 MSmits: that means the child nodes are together in memory right?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: you reserve the memory block that is just large enough for the number of children
 Angecide: yea, but I would have to store them within a bit
 reCurse: A bit?
 MSmits: oh my bfs playground
 Angecide: yea
 MSmits: that is pretty specific to mazesize though
 MSmits: if the maze is too big, it wont fit neatly in an integer
 Astrobytes: well you ain't gonna be storing your mcts nodes in a bit
 MSmits: oh wait, you mean the integer queue?
 MSmits: where i have a start and and end?
 Angecide: nah, the part where you talk about "BFS without classes"
 MSmits: yeah thats the queue i think
 MSmits: "popping" from the queue, increased the queueIndex
 MSmits: adding to the queue increases the end of the queue
 MSmits: so your "queue" window moves
 MSmits: and you're just using an integer array
 MSmits: when the start of the queue = the end of the queue, the search is done
 MSmits: well.. you havent found it then
 Astrobytes: oh wait, he wants to store the mcts nodes in an int
 Angecide: yep
 MSmits: well thats not all that helpful, because MCTS needs more than a single int per node
 MSmits: and if you're using those, you might as well have a class
 Astrobytes: ^
 reCurse: You need bigger ints
 Angecide: ahh, I thought I could clever and perhaps store everything in an int to boost performance
 reCurse: Are we talking C# here?
 Angecide: c++
 Angecide: just in general
 reCurse: ...
 reCurse: what?
 MSmits: Angecide nah, the compiler solves all your problems
 reCurse: Why would you care about class vs int in c++
 MSmits: it just makes it a long block of continguous memory like reCurse said
 Angecide: I thought maybe class was too much overhead compared to an int
 MSmits: there is no overhead
 Angecide: idk, maybe it is a silly area to look for performance
 reCurse: There is zero overhead to a class unless you have virtual members
 reCurse: Yeah it's silly
 MSmits: but we';ve all been there Angecide, at least if you started here without becoming an experienced coder first
 MSmits: we start to look for optimizations that dont work
 MSmits: i did as well
 MSmits: in bfs it helps, because those versions with classes, use more memory
 MSmits: so the information is spread out
 MSmits: you only need the integer
 reCurse: That has nothing to do with class
 reCurse: But the allocation
 MSmits: you're right
 reCurse: Same problem with a int*
 MSmits: it's just that people fill their class with members that are really big when they only need a single bit or very few
 Angecide: yeah I understand now, I see my quest for gaining performance was a bit misguided, but thanks for clearing it up
 reCurse: !profiler
 reCurse: We need a bot with useful shortcuts
 reCurse: Take the few good ideas from twitch
 MSmits: Angecide also, you have to wonder what your bottleneck is
 Astrobytes: Very true.
 Astrobytes: (re the bot idea)
 MSmits: reCurse the playground he is talking about does a profile, and in that case he is right and the way that class was setup, hurt the program
 reCurse: Any quest for performance must start with a profiler
 MSmits: so i can totally understand wanting to apply that elsewhere
 reCurse: Then maybe the explanation was not clear enough
 zhoubou: If you have a hammer...
 MSmits: reCurse probably, he surprised me with the question
 reCurse: Speaking of profiling, anyone had success with profiling an executable under wsl2?
 Angecide: yeah sry it came out of nowhere, just something I have been thinking about a lot
 MSmits: are you doing this for uttt?
 reCurse: No problem, just a surprising question
 reCurse: So is yours MSmits
 MSmits: my question?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: what did i ask
 MSmits: oh uttt
 MSmits: it's probably uttt, it was more of an introductory question to see if we could help him otherwise improve his perf. on that game
 MSmits: there are more important parts to  work on
 reCurse: I see
 MSmits: like a fast rollout
 MSmits: maybe better random function
 MSmits: UCT
 Astrobytes: re WSL2, maybe struct?
 Angecide: yea it's uttt
 Astrobytes: Also: did we all see the upcoming semi-private contest?
 reCurse: No

 Astrobytes: Only French eligible for prizes.
 Astrobytes: Might get XP from playing.
 reCurse: Such discrimination in 2021
 reCurse: Tsk tsk
 struct: all ive used on wsl2 was valgrind
 reCurse: Not very *diverse*
 Astrobytes: Yes. I was deeply shocked and highly offended.
 struct: intel vtune doesnt work on wsl2
 reCurse: I'm sure there's a way to be offended and get publicity for it
 reCurse: struct: Even with system monitoring?
 Wontonimo: so, the sopra-steria is really only for french devs?
 reCurse: So is it french coders or French coders?
 struct: I didnt try, I read a bit about it and it says its not supported
 struct: so I stopped there
 reCurse: Hmm ok thanks
 Westicles: I'm 1/8 french, can I win part of a tshirt?
 reCurse: Underwear
 Astrobytes: afaik it's French as in residing in France.
 reCurse: So all I need is someone's address
 Astrobytes: Feel free to ask for clarification, if it's just a language thing it might be different.
 Astrobytes: Hm, in that case...
 reCurse: I'm sure I could recruit a vessel in Fr
 Astrobytes: I know a fair number of people in France. Maybe I can open a little market here...
 reCurse: So many hashtags, you'd think it's 2012
 Astrobytes: haha, I didn't see that
 reCurse: #esport though, really?
 MSmits: a vassal?
 MSmits: or a vessel?
 reCurse: Why not both
 MSmits: sure
 Astrobytes: Indeed
 Astrobytes: #esport... I suppose #comptetitiveprogramming was too long
 MSmits: #esport is wrong
 Astrobytes: Or #competitiveprogramming
 MSmits: #esport is just #egaming i thought?
 Astrobytes: I won't go there on the abbreviation
 MSmits: ah ok, me neither
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, that's what I would always assume
 reCurse: Gaming implies leisure, sport implies competition
 MSmits: no need to go there then
 reCurse: But esport is a meme at this point
 struct: btw new insiders preview build lets you add start up commands to wsl
 reCurse: Startup commands? Isn't that just bashrc?
 Astrobytes: .bashrc
 reCurse: Yea yea
 Astrobytes: :P

 reCurse: Oh I see it's when the system starts
 reCurse: Ok
 Astrobytes: Well, when you start wsl
 Astrobytes: *whenever
 reCurse: But it's when the distribution starts
 reCurse: Not when you open a shell
 Astrobytes: aha, my bad, gotcha
 Astrobytes: Somehow missed the fact it said distribution 3 times and distro once. I blame the snow.
 reCurse: I realize it's a terrible place to ask, but is it possible for a GPU to trigger or make tinnitus worse?
 Astrobytes: I have terrible tinnitus but I'm not sure GPUs are capable of doing such things.
 reCurse: Might just be a coincidence but mine got suddenly noticeable ever since I started maxing out my GPU usage a few days ago
 reCurse: It's very annoying
 RoboStac: coil whine on gpu's is definitely a thing
 Astrobytes: Do some experiments
 reCurse: Yeah I'm trying to pinpoint it
 reCurse: Coil whine is one suspect yes
 reCurse: But should it stop when usage stops?
 struct: also gpu will make power supply work more
 reCurse: Or is it possible for it to linger as a tinnitus trigger
 Astrobytes: You most likely have something else triggering your tinnitus
 reCurse: The biology part escapes me
 Astrobytes: The tinnitus part escapes us biologists.
 reCurse: Maybe, the coincidence is just so suspect to me
 Astrobytes: Tinnitus is a symptom of so many things it's hard to list. 
 reCurse:&#160;:/
 reCurse: I counter it with music and headphones but also worried it might make it worse lol
 reCurse: sigh...
 Astrobytes: If you have other comorbidities it can help diagnosis sometimes.
 reCurse: Don't think I have those
 struct: I know it probably isnt very helpfull, but I just found on a forum a similar question

 reCurse: Oh... interesting.
 reCurse: "I realized that whenever I was exposed to the new PC for more than say 10-15 minutes when it was turned on, the ringing in my ears would spike like crazy (persisting even after turning off the PC"
 reCurse: That would match my experience
 Astrobytes: I guess if it matches the frequency of your tinnitus it could prolong/intensify it (see ringing in your ears after loud music exposure)
 reCurse: Yeah it's the part that was puzzling me, whether it would linger or not
 Astrobytes: How long does it persist after poweroff reCurse?
 reCurse: Makes the investigation that much more difficult
 reCurse: Haven't tried much
 reCurse: Couple of hours didn't help
 reCurse: And not really leaving home much during lockdown
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not that helpful.Try and keep a note of it regardless though.
 Benkay: Hey!
 Benkay: How's everyone?
 reCurse: Not bad
 Astrobytes: Not great, but not terrible.
 Westicles: Fair to middling
 Benkay: Anyone want to clash of code?
 Astrobytes: Behold the field where the clashers are, and see that it is empty.
 Astrobytes: What's the meta on SameGame?
 Westicles: In what sense?
 Astrobytes: Anyone actually use NRPA or anything? Or just beam search
 Westicles: Oh, not sure.  Wasn't much talk about it after the first couple days
 Astrobytes: I'm just catching up, so much to catch up on
 Benkay: Could I get someone to teach me JavaScript?
 Benkay: I know some bits of it not advanced.
 Astrobytes: Elsewhere, yes.
 Benkay: Where?
 Astrobytes: I would start with searching with your favourite search engine to be honest.
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes: you can start with montecarlo coupled with tabucolor
 Westicles: I guess the main thing on samegame is you are probably looking at deep offline searches 
 Benkay: What do you mean favourite search engine?
 Astrobytes: tabu... yes. And offline ofc. I'd just been thinking of montecarlo + most connected components
 darkhorse64: I have done online stuff. I am too lazy to code 20 solutions
 Astrobytes: tabu seems like a good approach on or offline
 Westicles: It is a bunch of work.  Even figuring out the tabu color for each case is a pain, not always obvious
 darkhorse64: NRPA looks like a promising algo but I wonder if it's efficient under short time constraints
 darkhorse64: Nah, coding tabu is easy
 darkhorse64: you need a fast BFS
 darkhorse64: If you have done puzzles or multis, you already have one ready
 Astrobytes: Fast BFS I have. re NRPA efficiency - if you do it offline that doesn't matter too much eh
 Westicles: I meant for finding the optimal solution.  A bunch of them have two different colors that can get close to the same score
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's an often discussed problem in papers iirc
 DomiKo: Astrobytes  I'm using NRPA
 darkhorse64: Could be an improvement, tabu with the two main colors
 DomiKo: and SP-MCTS
 Astrobytes: Oh nice. Offline or online DomiKo?
 DomiKo: Offline ofc
 DomiKo: for like 2H each test
 Astrobytes: Thought so.
 Astrobytes: Excellent results.
 Astrobytes: Westicles: just tabu for you or...?
 DomiKo: I was improving A LOT and I gained only ~2K&#160;:/ 
 Westicles: Yeah, pick a tabu color, make a random move list, delete a random move and anneal.  Not sure what you would call that...
 Westicles: Same as NS for me at least
 Astrobytes: SA w/ Tabu? I guess
 Astrobytes: NS... I can't believe I got that far without coding anything
 DomiKo: SameGame is so interesting 
 DomiKo: how simple algorithm made by Westicles can beat a lot of big paper's
 Westicles: Yeah, but the papers don't run for very long.  I was in a 3 month contest so probably that is a big chunk of the diff
 DomiKo: wait
 DomiKo: really?
 Westicles: Yeah, there was a contest for this way back when.  That's where the top4 on jsgames were competing

 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: 2012
 Westicles: back on the old dual core
 DomiKo: One question. If there is legal TABO move will you do it? or you never do such move if you don't have to
 darkhorse64: I do it as late as possible (only move)
 Westicles: I have a threshold for each problem, you can't pick the tabu color until there is a group of some size.  Except for some you have to make exceptions once or twice
 Astrobytes: as in late acceptance darkhorse64?
 DomiKo: so you pick tabu color after some time?
 Astrobytes: makes sense
 darkhorse64: late acceptance is something completely different (as in different context). You keep inferior solutions for a while
 Westicles: Huh, I was wrong.  The contest was on a different set of boards.  I guess I just ran it afterwards on jsgames, so only 3months for the code but not running
 Astrobytes: Yes I'm familiar, I misread your comment (missed the 'only move')
 Astrobytes: @darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: Still worked out pretty well Westicles
 Westicles: I hope xevi gives it a try, it is similar enough to NS he should be able to pass me
 struct: top solutionsof Same game are hardcoded or no?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: Full offline
 Astrobytes: Kinda the point for a lot of the optims
 Astrobytes: Newer ones are designed with that in mind
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you can still get a decent result within the provided time though
 DocCV: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/244ef867-52e2-4ab1-9369-157418b25a78">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/244ef867-52e2-4ab1-9369-157418b25a78</a>
 Astrobytes: Definitely.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: importing the test cases was tedious
 struct: isnt it trivial?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I did not automate it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: copy/pasted them
 struct: ah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: on top of this there are 20 duplicates
 UnnamedCodinGamer: can not figure out why
 Astrobytes: only aCat can explain that
 UnnamedCodinGamer: maybe for some approaches you could get different results
 UnnamedCodinGamer: It is strange
 Astrobytes: I am sure there was a 'reason' but it turned out to be redundant, don't quote me on that though.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: for most of the solutions it seems to be the case
 Westicles: Did people do bender4 offline?
 Astrobytes: Hmm, I'm not sure tbh. It seems doable online 
 Astrobytes: But I don't know who used what approach in b4
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm away to bed. See you all tomorrow, gn
 struct: gn
 MohamedMiri: too much lag or what&#160;?
 BananaInSpace: Ive been stuck in coders strike back boss 2 for a WEEK, any help T^T

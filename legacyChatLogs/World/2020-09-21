 dhaunac: Hello, I am wondering why I can't see the comments of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/54758deea287b728f23581109d47b2d73102">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/54758deea287b728f23581109d47b2d73102</a>
 dhaunac: I made a contribution, but I can't read the feedback anymore - can other people read that?
 Uljahn: nope
 Uljahn: it tells me there are 7 comments but i can see none
 Uljahn: yay, CG contribution on arxiv.org<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08696">https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08696</a>
 jacek: is it on CG?

 Uljahn: tourist_ka_dada: pls go to #clash to post invites there
 Uljahn: jacek: yes
 jacek: i cant find it
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/486222077fe22e3aa6bcdc0f729dd46223bb">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/486222077fe22e3aa6bcdc0f729dd46223bb</a>
 Uljahn: it's old
 jacek: not accepted?
 darkhorse64: Not even at WIP state
 jacek: so, ready for production
 darkhorse64: I'd rather not
 jacek: yeah, lets wait for friday evening
 AntiSquid: at least he fixed the graphics
 AntiSquid: but why the paper? lol should do a paper on some CG game too 
 AntiSquid: read "III.  BASELINEAGENTS"
 AntiSquid: i know it's baselines, but this is a paper&#160;! 
 77Dev: they  should replace shortest w/ most efficient
 Tishj: ^ 100%
 vtenneke: yeah shortest can really be sad if ur not coding in python or something
 PositiveQuark: ruby and js is also quite short
 PositiveQuark: no way you win that with java alone against experienced python programmers
 Danotris: Or learn Python :s
 Q12: I agree with 77Dev
 matrak091: or make shortest be lang exclusive (altho that can also cause some complications)
 LastRick: It's definitely hard to beat the python  and ruby coders in shortest  when I'm using Dart. It'll take 70 chars just to load imports and inputs.
 mrzalais: same for me using PHP
 LastRick: Makes it all the more sweet that I cleared the Clash of Code tree on the home page using Dart&#160;:)
 jacek: woo new puzzle of the week
 DomiKo: interesting one

 eulerscheZahl: i know i'm late to the partythat js-games was online for about 15 years. then acat links to it in a contribution and not even a month after it's completely gone&#160;:(
 Westicles: CG could take over if they list scores for each problem
 eulerscheZahl: i fear it might be related to my SQL injection&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: spoilerscheZahl
 Westicles: Yeah, I hoped they were just updating the site to fix it, but it has been a while now
 eulerscheZahl: they never even replied to my email. but quickly removed me from the leaderboard so I think they saw the email
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: interpol looking for a blackhat that frequents gaming sites

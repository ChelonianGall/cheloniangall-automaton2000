 JudasMoses: The shortest code challenge seems kinda dumb for c++...
 eulerscheZahl: you are free to switch language at any time

 TimothyAlexisVass: How is 1, 2, 3 related to 14?
 TimothyAlexisVass:&#160;:/
 jacek: clash reverse?
 TimothyAlexisVass: 1**2+2**3+3**3
 eulerscheZahl: 3**3 = 27 already
 TimothyAlexisVass: I meant 1**2+2**2+3**2
 Maxim251: interesting is that for switch statement if I want use enumerate for cases, I need cast enum to int
 eulerscheZahl: that doesn't sound right
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1318571f-56c0-4030-a901-28512fa1ca96">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1318571f-56c0-4030-a901-28512fa1ca96</a>
 eulerscheZahl: C++?
 Maxim251: Yes
 Maxim251: It suprised me too, when I start to play with it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3019153/how-do-i-use-an-enum-value-in-a-switch-statement-in-c/3019195#3019195">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3019153/how-do-i-use-an-enum-value-in-a-switch-statement-in-c/3019195#3019195</a>
 Maxim251: Yes, but that is integer input, My goal was to find out if I can store enum and use it for switch
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1a6b122c-9f47-429c-b70e-af450cb97319">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1a6b122c-9f47-429c-b70e-af450cb97319</a>
 eulerscheZahl: now you've done it: you made me open my IDE. Are you proud now?&#160;:/
 jacek: oh my!
 Maxim251: Question is if someone use enum containet to use in switch case? 
 jacek: MSmits: hello yavalath runner up
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/RBl7du3">https://tech.io/snippet/RBl7du3</a>
 eulerscheZahl: seems that I don't even need the (int) at case (int)second:
 eulerscheZahl: in C# that cast would be necessary
 Maxim251: yes... 
 jacek: what is this heresy
 Maxim251: only "type" must be casted to int
 BlaiseEbuth: No.
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't need any cast
 Maxim251: In my ide I get error if I dont do it, and it says, that switch dont suport enum 
 BlaiseEbuth: What compiler/C++ standard?
 eulerscheZahl: MS Visual Studio? :smirk:
 Maxim251: codingame compiler
 eulerscheZahl: if you ignore the error and try it anyways?
 eulerscheZahl: IDE highlighting and actual compiler result may differ
 Maxim251: hm, I did not try..
 BlaiseEbuth: I always use enum with switch on CG and never got any error...
 eulerscheZahl: I use polymorphism
 eulerscheZahl: and then wonder why it's so slow
 Illedan: Yo, zup?
 eulerscheZahl: still trying to find motivation for yare&#160;:/
 Illedan: yare?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/">https://yare.io/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/tournament">https://yare.io/tournament</a>
 Illedan: ah
 eulerscheZahl: the lack of real contests hits me hard
 Illedan: yeah, should be 3-4 CG contests a year
 eulerscheZahl: there is Lux AI. but such a long duration is a deal breaker to me
 Illedan: Agreed
 Illedan: and no C# yet?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so
 Illedan: Then I wont bother
 eulerscheZahl: i play yare with JS, so...
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: You can do the JS part of my Snake game if you want xD
 eulerscheZahl: that's easily the hardest part of the game then
 BlaiseEbuth: Maxim251, this works perfectly in the CG's IDE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7d9d7a9-9cf5-4296-9bea-55526263372c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b7d9d7a9-9cf5-4296-9bea-55526263372c</a>
 Maxim251: Ow, interesting, enum type is working for switch case... But why I have message on that line saying that switch is not suporting enums?
 eulerscheZahl: because of reasons
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't have any messages, not even warnings...
 Maxim251: casting enum container to int helps remove that message, and works like with normal integers
 eulerscheZahl: the syntax highlighting and compiler aren't the same
 eulerscheZahl: many languages have problems with different versions
 Maxim251: Ow, Yeah, thats make sense
 eulerscheZahl: lots of bug reports on discord already
 Illedan: I had a huge new feature in FB, but it was worse. I threw it away. Yesterday I tried it again and saw I crashed sometimes -.- Last battles should reveal crashes&#160;:(
 <b>**eulerscheZahl never noticed any problems, local IDE ftw</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: so you don't have the code of that feature anymore?
 Illedan: Sure, it was in my history
 Illedan: And I fixed it, just slightly better -.-
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-fantastic-bits/illedan">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-fantastic-bits/illedan</a>
 eulerscheZahl: fix it more
 Illedan: working on it :P
 eulerscheZahl: but nice rank already
 BlaiseEbuth: Use a starter, go legend.
 BlaiseEbuth: EZPZ
 eulerscheZahl: that's lame
 BlaiseEbuth: Lamer gonna lame.
 TimothyAlexisVass: top 400 took like 120 clashes... Top 200 took me 377 clashes&#160;:/
 TimothyAlexisVass: Actually learned quite a lot, I'm grateful.
 TimothyAlexisVass: Think I'll have to learn Ruby to get to top 100 though...
 BlaiseEbuth: Use abot, go top100, ezpz.
 TimothyAlexisVass: abot?
 BlaiseEbuth: *a bot
 TimothyAlexisVass: How?
 BlaiseEbuth: :zipper_mouth:
 TimothyAlexisVass: :unamused:
 TimothyAlexisVass: I care less about the position if it's cheating.
 BlaiseEbuth: :see_no_evil: :speak_no_evil:
 TimothyAlexisVass: When a challenge only shows first console.log in Standard Output Stream, is there anything I can do to show them all?
 Stepan0806:  
 WWFYMN: yo mama
 Stepan0806: When will start fall challenge?
 ProCoder03: last year, it was in november 11 - 15 
 ProCoder03: ig same dates...
 eulerscheZahl: we don't even know if it will be a bot contest this time
 ProCoder03: :scream:
 BlaiseEbuth: console.error TimothyAlexisVass
 Stepan0806: what else?
 ProCoder03: what else, escape&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: possible

 Illedan: Pray for multiplayer
 BlaiseEbuth: Sacrifice goats!
 Illedan: Sure, where can I find the goats?
 Illedan: Outside CG office?
 eulerscheZahl: not directly. it gives achievements like "play 50 clashes" that give XP
 nuII: ok thanks, i was just wondering
 SurenderHarsha: So i took a test for "get a job" here. Is it actually useful?

 MiyamuraIzumi: 2 months till the challenge
 MiyamuraIzumi: I remember there's some saying that they really want a bot game
 MiyamuraIzumi: and actually, I don't see if there is a different

 Gogovich: how this chat is working do they put a random person together in group&#160;? 
 BlaiseEbuth: Person? There's no such thing here.
 Gogovich: sorry am pretty new so thats why iasked 
 Wontonimo: this is everyone 
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 Wontonimo: what brings you here Gogovich&#160;?  (the text is red because your name is in it, no other reason)
 eulerscheZahl: this chat is for the entire website. you can chat with anyone online (if the other person also wants to chat)
 jacek: you can chat even if the other person doesnt want to chat
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course.
 Gogovich: ahh okey guys thx 
 Gogovich: am really suprised that clash of code can be solved in one line of code while am making more than 10 lines 
 Gogovich: xd
 jacek: impossible!
 The-matrix: that was fun
 Gogovich: yeah such a shame tbh:unamused:
 The-matrix: ........
 The-matrix: hwllo?
 Gogovich: mmm but how 
 Gogovich: just how can we do it in one line 
 Gogovich: it seems that i need to learn more about java to deal with 
 BlaiseEbuth: Removing line breaks.
 Gogovich: xd maybe 
 sgt390: use python man it's 2021 xD
 BlaiseEbuth: That deserve a ban...
 The-matrix: lol
 Gogovich: yeah i know but my target now is java cuz the majority of companies  are asking about that 
 The-matrix: how is every one?
 Gogovich: not bad mate 
 jacek: do companies really ask for clashes?
 BlaiseEbuth: do companies really ask for java?
 The-matrix: thats good
 Gogovich:&#160;:)
 The-matrix: :relaxed:
 MiyamuraIzumi: my company really ask for Java :D
 Gogovich: great 
 BlaiseEbuth: Companies these days...
 MiyamuraIzumi: ofcouse if you apply for an inexperience, Java is optional, but  Java is for work
 Gogovich: yes true , they ask about jee as well

 eulerscheZahl: alt+shift+q for closing is much more convenient. can be done without twisting your hand or using both hands

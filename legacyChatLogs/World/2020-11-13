 NinjaDoggy: depends on the game, but generally yes
 NinjaDoggy: most algorithms benefit from having more iterations of some sort
 Laminator: Right, I just wasn't sure if they used like a different strength engines to help compensate
 Laminator: guess I'll just vectorize everything I can with Numpy and keep my fingers crossed lol
 dreadylein: code in py, then when you think you cant possibly optimize, start porting it to a native language that you want to learn&#160;:)
 dreadylein: *anymore
 Laminator: I guess it's nice I'm forced to optimize as I go. Otherwise, I would have a monster of a brute force solution by now lol
 Nicowk_: HOla
 dreadylein: @Laminator well .. iam personaly absolutly on your side, if throwing more hw at a problem solves it, perfect :D 
 Laminator: I mean, the whole point of modern AI is to not have to write a crap ton of 'if' statements. I could come up with a solution with no interpretation possible using insane computation. But that would be too easy I guess.
 LineBender: How do you like Fall Challenge?
 Waffle3z: "Brewing a potion for the very first client awards a +3 rupee bonus, but this can only happen 4 times during the game."
 Waffle3z: if both users brew the first potion in the same turn, does that count as happening twice?
 Waffle3z: if it's happened 3 times, can both users still brew the first potion at the same time, totaling 5 times the +3 bonus was granted?
 Xenoid: Yes, and yes (see Technical Details from the instructions)
 Laminator: Jeez I've spent more time on this than my homework lol
 lNitsua: I put maybe 4 hours into it and barely made bronze
 lNitsua: the amount of time I put into my homework was 0
 lNitsua: So I feel it
 Marler510: hi all
 weeez: lol
 Marler510: (( 
 weeez: where are you from
 yangj56: why the actionType CAST is mixed with SPELL?
 VizGhar: Hmm "Not enough ingredients to learn 14" even tho [0,0,0,1]
 VizGhar: ah "read-ahead tax"
 Gaurav11: hi
 Marler510: I am from russia
 Laminator: you can pay tax, you can also gain some tax. I'm not coding it lol
 Gaurav11: hlo

 SimonPrins: You need to add spaces between your values.
 SimonPrins: System.out.println(nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointY + " " + thrust);

 Xenoid: You need spaces (" "), not empty strings ("")
 SimonPrins: Those are empty strings, not spaces.
 Index500: @Xenoid thx it works
 rcar: I like that the error called you bud though
 rcar: feels folksy
 FMTriguero: Hello guys, sorry for bothering, but is it possible to play vs the boss of the previous league? (moved to wood1 league, but wanna check code vs wood2 boss
 Xenoid: I don't think that's possible
 FMTriguero: okay, thank you Xenoid&#160;:)
 THH: hello
 spathula: quick question, are the spell recipes always the same?
 Xenoid: The deck of spell recipes is always the same, yes
 Xenoid: But the order is random
 tutubalin: spathula there's a predefined deck of spells and customers.they are drawn from the deck randomly
 Xenoid: The starting spells are always the same
 spathula: oh, ok, thanks guys

 The_chosen_one: Hello
 SeekDog: Hello there
 riioze: hello
 TWW: how do you place the read-ahead tax?
 Xenoid: If you learn a spell with tomeIndex &gt; 0, you need to have that many tier 0 ingredients. If you do, then the ingredients are placed automatically on every spell with a smaller index than the one you learned.
 TWW: ah okay thank you, I was trying to read too far ahead without ingredients so it was invalid
 SeekDog: castable = castable&#160;!= "0"
 SeekDog: what does it mean?
 SeekDog: can anyone explain to me?
 Xenoid: If the current value of castable is "0", then change the value of castable to false. Otherwise, change the value of castable to true.
 Denebil: castable on the left is boolean while castable cming from input is in
 Denebil: *int
 Maciulis: *str
 Denebil: Thanks Maciulis&#160;:)

 ionutzxy: hello
 yhyoxx: 11/16/20
 ionutzxy: thanks
 Scarfield: LastRick you output "LEARN id" the id of the spell you want to learn. You get the input of the 6 available spells to learn each turn. The delta values for each (negative values for ingredients you pay, positive values for ingredients you get from the spell), you get the id of the spells when reading the "delta" values as well
 Scarfield: chat still dead&#160;:/

 Slendr: Hi, I'm currently working on the Power of Thor - Episode 1 but I got an error I don't understand&#160;: "The left-hand side of an assignement must be a variable".
 Slendr: Hi&#160;!
 Slendr: Hi.
 b0n5a1: .
 UmeHearts: hey
 AshKetchum: Hi Slendr, if it is C++, then it must be else if(...), you wrote else(...)
 Scarfield: Slendr when you read the input, the input has to be assigned (stored) to a variable, what language are you coding in?
 offroff: I don't understand why I can't afford some spells. I guess it has something to do with tax but I don't get it.. Can anyone explain?
 Scarfield: only the first (bottom) spell is free. The other spells you pay 1 tier 0 ingredient for each spell below the one you buy/learn. 3rd spell cost 2, 5th cost 4
 cguzman: where is the log of the chat??
 enesdgn: what u mea
 enesdgn: what u mean
 tomatoes: adblock
 LastRick: So do I understand this correctly, we are all piling up in Bronze until Silver opens in a few days?
 SeekDog:  = 
 Xmaster6: Hey, do u know when they are going to open the silver league?
 tomatoes: click league icon on top
 tomatoes: 16.11
 Uljahn: yes, click on the league on the top next to the timer
 Xenoid: Silver league opens on November 16
 Donotalo: that's correct

 Barimehdi77: how to know the different between Cast spell and brew spell  
 ClockSort: is the Repeatable bug fixed now?
 Barimehdi77: how can I know The different between cast spell and brow spell?
 Barimehdi77: how can I know The different between cast spell and brow spell
 Barimehdi77: how can I know The different between cast spell and brow spell
 Barimehdi77: how can I know The different between cast spell and brow spell
 Barimehdi77: how can I know The different between cast spell and brow spell
 Cukinoden: @barimehdi77 by the action_type there's 3 diffrent action_type "CAST" , "BREW", "CAST_OPPONENT"
 ClockSort: it looks better in the visualizer
 Barimehdi77: sorry for The spamming I thought The message wasn't sent 
 ParticleBeam: I was going to make a joke about repeatable bugs
 [CG]Thibaud: test
 Barimehdi77: @cukinoden I know that but when I tried it I noted That it Cast all the spells not just cast once
 Cukinoden: @barimehdi77 it depend on your code i don't know what are you doing but when you find a action_type = "CAST" it means that this action it's a spell otherwise it's a potion "BREW"
 Barimehdi77: I write an if statment if (action_type = "CAST")
 [Csongor]: ...
 [CG]Maxime: Hello!
 ClockSort: @barimehdi77 you don't brew spells, you brew potions.
 [CG]Maxime: Chat rebooted
 [CG]Maxime: [CG]Thibaud better?
 tomatoes: it seems. started to receive new messages
 struct: test
 charlesCabage: i have a programming question
 Barimehdi77: the spells is when you create upgrade an ingredient from tier to tier and the potions is what you sell?
 struct: sure
 charlesCabage: how do i solve problems effectively
 struct: Barime potion is at the bottom is what you sell
 Counterbalance: aww it started yesterday?!
 rmuskovets: yea
 struct: at the left its your learned spells
 aristotelis-bobas: is there a silver league?
 struct: and at mid the spells you can learn
 struct: silver opens 16-11
 aristotelis-bobas: ok thnx struct
 rmuskovets: so good basic spells are always same
 tomatoes: they're not good but enough
 Barimehdi77: but how can I know if i can create a new tier ingredient? 
 struct: yes you start always with same 4 spells
 charlesCabage: every one gonna ignore me?
 charlesCabage: ok
 struct: You can see your own igredients Barime
 struct: if your own igredients &gt;= cost of spell
 struct: you can use it
 rmuskovets: charlesCabage whats your problem?
 rmuskovets: ah
 struct: if its learned and castable ofc
 Barimehdi77: but the actions loop come first then the inventory loop  
 Barimehdi77: so how can i know it?
 struct: you must store them somewhere
 tomatoes: first save all to variables, then logic
 Barimehdi77: when I do this and run the program tell me "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur."
 Barimehdi77: just ignore it or what wrong&#160;?
 struct: are you outputing anything before reading everyhing?
 Barimehdi77: yes
 struct: You should read everything before outputing
 struct: Or it can cause bugs
 struct: You will start reading values from other turns that you previously did not read
 Barimehdi77: so now i have to store all The data after that start the logic things
 eulerscheZahl: chat rebooted, let's see if it's faster now
 eulerscheZahl: yes, much better!
 struct: its good yes
 struct: yes Barimehdi77 that is the best way
 kovi: test
 kovi: yay its working
 Barimehdi77: okay thank you 
 [CG]Maxime: Barimehdi77 no need to "store" it, only read it
 akshat: Where can I find JS specifications being used in CG IDE?
 akshat: And can I add third party libs?
 rmuskovets: I *think* it's stripped down VScode
 [CG]Maxime: akshat node 12, no third party libs
 rmuskovets: and about third party libs, just include them in your code
 eulerscheZahl: akshat <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 akshat: Okay, thanks!
 jrke: i thought why everyone was saying akshat cause its my real name lol
 akshat: lol
 [CG]Maxime: ahah
 Barimehdi77: I create a for loop after storing all data to scan all the actions using action_count but when I test my bot I get "has not provided 1 lines in time.Barimehdi77 was disqualified. "
 rmuskovets: maybe you've a infinite loop (not including the main loop)?
 Barimehdi77: i add my loop after the inventory loop
 rmuskovets: btw how does CG have a readline() function for TS/JS even though Node doesn't have one iirc?
 jrke: what is breaking condition of that loop?
 Neumann: rmuskovets: home-made
 Barimehdi77: for (int i = 0; i &lt; action_count; i++)
 jrke: java or c++
 Barimehdi77: c
 jrke: did you did \n
 rmuskovets: Neumann: how can I get a function like that? :sweat_smile:
 jrke: printf("your action\n")
 andrefpoliveira: Hmm Im also getting that error. But I did not change it. And before didnt got it
 Neumann: They published their code once, don't know where you can find it now

 Barimehdi77: can I share with you all the for loop
 eulerscheZahl: had that in my downloads folder, was shared on discord a few months ago
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a data messy
 rmuskovets: ty so much
 Barimehdi77: cuz i add \n after every printf
 andrefpoliveira: Does c# and c++ run similarly in terms of time?
 Zhmyh: no
 andrefpoliveira: C++ is faster?
 struct: yes
 andrefpoliveira: okok ty
 [Csongor]: not significantly
 andrefpoliveira: I was using Python but I cant explore a lot of nodes xD
 andrefpoliveira: Too slow
 dreadylein: yes, c# due to beeing a managed language needs todo bound checks, its not a ton but it adds up
 TomerBG: hey guys
 rmuskovets: andrefpoliveira: what challenge are you doing? just curious
 rmuskovets: hi
 TomerBG: Do you play the fall challenge?
 andrefpoliveira: Fall Challenge ahah
 rmuskovets: yeah
 rmuskovets: i'm in bronze now
 andrefpoliveira: Its the limit right now xD
 rmuskovets: at least not in wood
 andrefpoliveira: Ahah yes
 andrefpoliveira: I was 150th xD now 1300th ahahah
 TomerBG: how are you preventing your bot from getting stuck with uneeded stuff in your inventory?
 andrefpoliveira: I don't
 andrefpoliveira: Not on that level
 rmuskovets: i make a queue of actions my bot needs to do for a order
 rmuskovets: order is chosen by using a heuristic
 rmuskovets: a simple one tho
 TomerBG: nice
 andrefpoliveira: I'm trying a BFS
 andrefpoliveira: But Python is too slow for that
 jrke: BFS??
 andrefpoliveira: Is it bad? xD
 rmuskovets: i dont think so
 rmuskovets: but... how did you manage to use it for this??
 jrke: no i mean how are you applying it
 eulerscheZahl: BFS was my first idea too
 eulerscheZahl: but i discarded it, too slow
 andrefpoliveira: I create a class that is the current state
 andrefpoliveira: And then explore it
 Uljahn: do you deepcopy?
 jrke: ah beam search?
 andrefpoliveira: Yeah but it is my best shot so far. But some bug somewhere
 Uljahn: that's slow af
 jrke: yup will be slow
 andrefpoliveira: Ahah yeah that is my biggest problem
 rmuskovets: eulerscheZahl: my *first* idea was to do the first found order&#160;:)
 andrefpoliveira: Ahah yeah
 Sakisan: I don't pick up stuff unless I have like 5 open spots left or I have a clear sequence of actions that result in the completion of a recipe
 rmuskovets: i thought only discord translates emoticons to emojis
 andrefpoliveira: :P
 jrke:&#160;;)
 andrefpoliveira: :D
 andrefpoliveira: What languages are you using?
 jrke: c++
 rmuskovets: I use TypeScript
 rmuskovets: fast enough for now
 TomerBG: py3
 andrefpoliveira: And positions?&#160;;)
 rmuskovets: 1234/1743 in bronze
 Sakisan: I'm one of the few that use Haskell xD
 andrefpoliveira: Ahah nice
 Barimehdi77: is this an infinty loop "for (int i = 0; i &lt; action_count; i++)"
 rmuskovets: woah
 jrke: my code is in progress
 andrefpoliveira: Nop Barimehdi
 jrke: will be ready in 2-3 days i think
 andrefpoliveira: Nice nice
 andrefpoliveira: When silver opens up ahah
 Barimehdi77: but why I get time out after test my not
 jrke: 16th
 Barimehdi77: bot
 andrefpoliveira: jrke F
 andrefpoliveira: Nice
 jrke: no 16th is not my rank its date on which silver opens
 andrefpoliveira: AHHHHA
 andrefpoliveira: xd
 andrefpoliveira: Well I will convert my py code to C++
 jrke: Barimehdi add debugings in your code
 struct: Not many Pt on bronze yet
 Sakisan: that's a lot of time
 jrke: and debug it
 Barimehdi77: every time I put printf means this is a one rond? 
 rmuskovets: yeah
 rmuskovets: to do debug output use fprintf(stderr, your message)
 Barimehdi77: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0bac0ff5-783d-4a85-a736-80bcc9084195">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0bac0ff5-783d-4a85-a736-80bcc9084195</a>
 Barimehdi77: but I get timeout
 Barimehdi77: why?
 struct: add a break
 Barimehdi77: this is after the for loop of inventory
 struct: you can be outputing multiple times with that loop
 struct: if you are not exiting it after you output
 Barimehdi77: how?
 struct: because code keeps running
 rmuskovets: it does multiple iterations
 rmuskovets: i compose a queue of things to do
 struct: printf();break;
 rmuskovets: and every iteration i check that queue if everything's in it
 Barimehdi77: oh okay let me try it
 struct: break; makes you exit the loop
 Barimehdi77: I add break after every printf() but I get This "Barimehdi77 has not provided 1 lines in time."

 Barimehdi77: This is the new code
 Jayantpro: When my pod isnt oriented as it is supposed to be, what does the thrust do at that point? Turn it?
 Jayantpro: And is thrust the accelaration or velocity?
 jrke: printf("Rest\n"); make it "REST" first of all

 Barimehdi77: exactly this "Barimehdi77 has not provided 1 lines in time.Barimehdi77 was disqualified."
 struct: Does the code ever reach that loop?
 Counterbalance: you could add a variable indicating you printed a command, and check if you did after the loop
 struct: or he could check the i variable
 eulerscheZahl: Counterbalance, hinice to see you
 eulerscheZahl: usually you are the one who knows the rules best
 Jayantpro: It says that my code is working and that I won against the bot but doesnt show anytihng on the video...

 eulerscheZahl: 1 day and 2 hours earlier this time
 eulerscheZahl: and 3900 players in the arena already :o
 Counterbalance: You're already top 1 as usual&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 8th to be more accurate&#160;;)
 Counterbalance: Yeah! 14k signed up, curious to see how many will play
 AntonioRodri: Hello
 jrke: Barimehdi77 printf("Rest\n"); make it "REST"
 eulerscheZahl: last time we had 5k players and 13.6k signed up
 AntonioRodri: how I know wich is my inventory?
 struct: jrke his code timesout
 Hjax: AntonioRodri your inventory is first
 jrke: AntonioRodri first one
 AntonioRodri: always?
 AntonioRodri: even if am blue o red?
 struct: also at start your spells are always castable
 Barimehdi77: waht REST do?
 struct: oh wait
 struct: It should output the first if then ...
 Counterbalance: Barimehdi77 your action_type assignment looks iffy
 Uemu[yihssan]: why is no one silver&#160;?
 jrke: cause silver is not opened yet
 jacek: because they dont use jacekmax
 Jayantpro: We dont really have to use distance for next checkpoint anytime in wood 2 right?
 Uemu[yihssan]:  Oh okay
 Barimehdi77: Counterbalance&#160;: whY??
 struct: Barimehdi77
 struct: fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", actions[i].action_type);
 struct: add this to your loop
 Counterbalance: you do a malloc and then assign a pointer to char[21] to that field
 struct: while loop
 struct: and you see
 struct: what is happening
 Counterbalance: actions[i].action_type = (char *)malloc(21 * sizeof(char));
 Barimehdi77: I get "OPPONENT_CAST" erery time
 struct: yeah
 struct: Something else is wrong
 Counterbalance: your leaking memory, and overwriting that allocated memory with a pointer to a stack variable, so all your actions have the same value
 Counterbalance: pointing to an undefined memory location...
 Barimehdi77: so I have to delete the malloc line?
 Counterbalance: yeah, and make that action_type in your struct an int, and do the strcmp test once while reading the input and assign an int to that field
 Counterbalance: say 1 for BREW, 2 for CAST etc..
 Counterbalance: This is what I have (C++ but it should work in C)

 Icebox: it literally says "during the game"
 DToTheE: How do I use the seed that is produced by some of my last battles? I want to retry one with new code.
 Barimehdi77: now it's work fine Thank you
 struct: DToTheE enable expert mode on settings on the left
 Barimehdi77: what this means. "Barimehdi77 attempted an invalid REST action:All spells are already castable"
 eulerscheZahl: that the REST as no effect
 struct: Well you have no exhausted spells
 struct: its not an error just a warning
 DToTheE: @struct, Okay, I enabled Expert mode and pasted the seed in Manual.
 jrke: euler by REST you can also use your exausted spells
 struct: now press play my code
 Barimehdi77: but how can i know when I have to rest the spells
 struct: you should play that seed that is on manual
 struct: bool castable; // in the first league: always 0; later: 1 if this is a castable player spell

 Barimehdi77: i did this but still print the rest when castable == 0
 DToTheE: @struct I see. Ihad to delete the AI that was there, and put the player that beat me to make the situation the same.
 struct: DToTheE you can also use "Send game parameters to ide" if you are checking last battles on ide
 struct: that will change the player and seed to the current battle you are seeing
 struct: Barimehdi77 castable doesnt check if you have resources for the spell, it only checks if its exhausted or not
 ntroPi: Rupee or Ruby? - I'm getting mixed messages here&#160;:-D
 eulerscheZahl: player_one when did you decide to ditch C#?but nice submit
 ParticleBeam: Ouch. Go away for an hour or so and rank dropped by 20+
 andrefpoliveira: I got away for an hour and my rank dropped 200 xD
 tomatoes: maybe new promotions from wood
 eulerscheZahl: that's normal in contests
 andrefpoliveira: Yeah I'm joking
 jacek: finally checking for legality of the actions got me 500 ranks up
 jrke: euler how many sims are you getting?
 Gabbek: hello everyone&#160;:)
 [Csongor]: hello
 Gabbek: whoa, much has changed from yesterday; guess we're doing some search or sims now?&#160;:)
 Barimehdi77: how can I know that the inventory is full
 ParticleBeam: Sum up the inventory items and must not exceed 10 total
 [Csongor]: if it has 10 ingredients
 jrke: if sum of all ingriedients=10
 Hjax: oh boy sims 
 Hjax: my favorite (not really)
 Gabbek: Hjax how's going?&#160;:)
 Hjax: i only worked a bit last night, didnt get anything worth uploading 
 Hjax: i was hoping the weird bugs would be fixed 
 jacek: is it true theyre gonna give urgency in input?
 Hjax: that would be nice
 Gabbek: are they fixed already? Read a bit on forums that it should be
 Hjax: oh good 
 jrke: any link for the forum?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: they did it
 Gabbek: nice, thanks for info DomiKo
 Gabbek: jrke - one second
 Gabbek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495</a>
 struct: urgency is currently given on price
 struct: Care
 struct: Urgency bonus*
 Gabbek: oh, okey, thanks struct!
 Hjax: ah thats perfect
 Hjax: now you just can ignore urgency lol 
 Gabbek: I'm looking for some inspiration now... anything that works on top? I guess I should get rid of my full heurestics approach without any search
 jrke: is urgency now in price
 Gabbek: jrke yes
 Hjax: i need to work out how i want to sim
 kovi: argh
 Hjax: hows it going kovi
 struct: I guess kovi just got my bad news
 jacek: huh
 Gabbek: that's good news - as he'll be able to advance further now :D
 Hjax: so are the top people already doing sims 
 Hjax: i still see a python in the top 10 
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 jacek: at least one of them doing 5-ply search
 jacek: though i think without opponent
 Hjax: i see
 DomiKo: 5-ply?
 kovi: i add urgency twice then
 eulerscheZahl: shipped my sim this morning (it's evening here now)
 Hjax: guess ill need to get cracking on a sim
 eulerscheZahl: urgency is now added to the input already, was changed recently
 struct: "we've added the bonus-related info into the intputtaxCount and tomeIndex for BREW actions now contain that data"
 struct: from discord
 struct: just now
 ParticleBeam: What is the "urgency"?
 Gabbek: I'm afraid I'll stay in bronze then :p
 Hjax: ParticleBeam the bonus for doing potions at the top of the list 
 ParticleBeam: Ah I see. Thanks
 ParticleBeam: Which one gives the bonus info? taxCount or tomeIndex?
 Nerchio: its in the rules
 Nerchio: refresh
 ParticleBeam: Ah. Thanks
 Hjax: i was musing yesterday about how good monte carlo would be at this game
 Hjax: i dont think it would be amazing 
 eulerscheZahl: my MC was around rank 15, i replaced it now
 struct: o.o
 Hjax: but monte carlo approaches have been used to play card games successfully 
 Hjax: and this game is at least somewhat like a card game
 Hjax: so i could see it working 
 eulerscheZahl: it did to some degree
 AshKetchum: Do we have to keep track of the 4 times the first client gets potion brewed, or can we figure out that bonus ended just from that round's input?
 struct: not anymore
 struct: its given on inputs now
 struct:  int tomeIndex; // in the first two leagues: always 0; later: the index in the tome if this is a tome spell, equal to the read-ahead tax
 Hjax: you still want to know how many bonuses are left 
 struct: oh wait
 struct: thats old
 struct: Its new now Hjax
 kovi: it is also given
 Hjax: to know if you want to delay making a potion until its moved up in the queue 
 struct:             int taxCount; // in the first two leagues: always 0; later: the amount of taxed tier-0 ingredients you gain from learning this spell; For brews, this is how many times you can still gain an urgency bonus
 Hjax: ah 
 struct: You get all the data
 Hjax: i see 
 struct: also price has the price with bonus included
 Hjax: so its looking like this is going to be a game i need to use Rust for 
 Hjax: if people are being sim heavy 
 AshKetchum: oh thanks struct
 jacek: rust? :scream:
 Hjax: my rust is better than my C++
 struct: Ban rust
 Hjax: although if i stick to java maybe i have a shot at #1 in the language ranking 
 Nerchio: no you don't
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Hjax: oh right, you are playing arent you 
 Nerchio: :smiling_imp:
 Hjax: big bully nerchio :P
 struct: This is why I learned D
 jacek: D has structs?
 struct: ofc
 Nerchio: wala is also good in java and he usually places high
 Nerchio: btw is C# significantly faster than Java on CG? It shoudn't be I guess
 Hjax: i beat wala in unleash the geek at least, i was second in the java ranking, after teccles 
 struct: C# has release on arena
 struct: So maybe it has advantage?
 Nerchio: writing any simulation in java makes me sick before i even start :D
 Hjax: same lol
 Nerchio: that's not a good attitude :joy:
 ParticleBeam: Hmm. Time to try a more calculated approach
 Nerchio: i wouldn't mind it usually but 50ms isn't that much of time so..
 Hjax: yeah, and if you arent careful the garbage collector will happy pause your code for 30 ms 
 Hjax: happily* 
 Nerchio: can you be more positive you make me wanna learn C++ :D
 eulerscheZahl: i can't compare C# to Java as I don't try to write fast code in Java. But I can tell that C# got significantly faster short before the last contest
 Hjax: if i do a sim approach (which is looking likely) i could write it in java and then port to rust 
 eulerscheZahl: release mode helps a lot
 eulerscheZahl: and .net core over Mono
 Hjax: alternately i learn C# really fast lol
 dreadylein: oh we now have release mode in c#&#160;?
 dreadylein: neat
 Hjax: syntax is similar to java right?
 dreadylein: yeah
 Icebox: imagine relying on language performance LOL
 struct: only on arena though
 Icebox: *cries in python*
 inoryy: still waiting for C++ -O3
 dreadylein: like .. you can read the code instantly normaly
 struct: ^
 Gabbek: well - with python you can still do some basic search and get to top10 atm, I think
 eulerscheZahl: when coming from Java, it's really easy to learn C#
 Nerchio: well I guess i will write in Java and if it makes me mad i will try C# lol
 Gabbek: I don't even have depth 1 search and it would help for sure
 Icebox: oh yea I'm memeing
 eulerscheZahl: it's only 1 day in the contest. give it another week and there will be mostly C++ at the top
 Icebox: eulerscheZahl this is comparable to C4L
 eulerscheZahl: less opponent interaction
 Icebox: I'm willing to bet I'll put up a fight with python
 Nerchio: yeah at the start of the contest you can get top with any language
 Nerchio: usually it moves into most ppl C++
 eulerscheZahl: and more important to find a good order to cast spells than C4L i think
 eulerscheZahl: =&gt; search
 struct: Icebox Why did you never switch from python for contests?
 struct: Any reason?
 Icebox: I do
 eulerscheZahl: let's talk again next week
 eulerscheZahl: if you are still here next week that is
 Icebox: I finished last one with C++ struct
 Icebox: eulerscheZahl that's some nerve assuming I'm gonna leave
 Icebox: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you are a player for the first weekend
 Nerchio: read input and exit :grimacing:
 struct: Icebox should start joining on the last days instead
 Icebox: just cause you don't see me in top 10 after the first weekend doesn't mean that I'm not working on it
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: you won this round
 Icebox: last contest was an example of me sitting on a completely wrong approach and never gettint out of gold even with C++
 Icebox: my experience is still incomparable with most of top players
 Icebox: I'm fast but that's it
 DomiKo: i believe that you don't need c++ in that one
 struct: Im slow
 struct: I never code anything for the first few days
 struct: I wait until everything gets updated
 Icebox: tbh I'd LOVE to see another 4h contest
 aCat: :D:D
 aCat: could be nice
 Gabbek: aCat hello!
 struct: As long as I dont have to wait 6 months to get a 4 hours contest
 inoryy: botg ruleset 
 aCat: except CG performance issues
 Icebox: yeah
 inoryy: part of the challenge
 Icebox: the website was down for 2h for me
 Gabbek: finally I see you on a chat, would like to say thank you for LoCM! :D
 Icebox: and I still managed to get top 10
 Icebox: in 2h vs everyone elses 4h
 aCat: you welcome :D
 Icebox: which makes me both sad and hyped for next one
 Gabbek: probably the only multi I've written a decent bot for :D
 DanTheMan832: the chat blocks out my code even when i collapse it what do i do?
 inoryy: next one?
 aCat: I oftenn look on the chat rarely talk - because then I don;t have time to do anything else ^^'
 Icebox: what? you don't deem it realistic?
 Icebox: another 4h contest?
 Gabbek: hehe, noticed that's the case, started being a bit more noticable on the chat lately ^^
 Icebox: I don't see why we couldn't have another 4h contest in 2021 or 2022 after a solid website performance updgrade
 aCat: yeah, before I didn't see you much
 aCat: you avoid joining our PL slack community?
 aCat: I know Zylo spammed you about it :D:D
 Gabbek: not really avoiding, more like just being too afraid for some reason - I'm a quiet person :D
 Gabbek: guess I should change that, as I remember reading about the slack community once and then forgetting about it completely
 aCat: you can listen instead of talking :joy_cat:
 eulerscheZahl: or stay here instead of splitting our community further
 aCat:&#160;:*
 eulerscheZahl: i already find it bad that we have #Fr with little interaction to this channel
 eulerscheZahl: typo, meant "sad"
 Gabbek: not going anywhere eulerscheZahl - after all I'm doing exercises and multis mostly; pretty sure I'm too bad for contests yet.
 aCat: youre right euler
 Icebox: eulerscheZahl that's a strong statement for someone who's pretty active in "De" channel
 Counterbalance:  Gabbek looking at your rank i'd say you're ready
 aCat: but global community uses voice rarely
 aCat: and damn
 Gabbek: speaking of release mode - space maze was the only place where debug / release was pretty much exactly the same for me, 1.9s to 2s :D
 aCat: half are my students ^^'
 eulerscheZahl: active on #De as in: "min"
 eulerscheZahl: moin*
 eulerscheZahl: i reply when i see a message. but i don't start a new conversation there
 eulerscheZahl: and i wouldn't be sad if it was gone
 Icebox: well you don't start a new conversation in general either :D
 Icebox: or at least not during contests
 Icebox: remember that my experience is only what happens during contests
 [Csongor]: /me
 eulerscheZahl: we have no general anymore. too many letter for the new design
 RockyMullet: #Es is mostly people insulting Zarthax
 Gabbek: Counterbalance my rank most likely won't change that much further, I simply don't have any good idea for fall challenge - started with heurestics since they are really simple, but that's about it&#160;:)
 inoryy: 1 weekend gang
 eulerscheZahl: it's Friday!
 RockyMullet: 1 weekend&#160;?
 ParticleBeam: Oh. Friday 13th. Didn't notice
 inoryy: code something up in the first weekend then pretend you don't have time anymore
 eulerscheZahl: i noticed when i took off for the contest
 dreadylein: @inoryy :D
 struct: I don't mind using voice, but I rarely see anyone there
 eulerscheZahl: that's his usual tactic
 struct: At least that I can recognize
 RockyMullet: inoryy hey stop leaking my strat
 struct: I coded something for the first 10 minutes, got rank 1 and then stopped
 StepiM: Hi!  bided their time - is this TL or just some command from game?
 Or64bit: Heys guys
 Or64bit: Is there anyone online that knows c well?
 struct: StepiM I did not understand what does TL stand for?
 StepiM: Time Limit. Like, my code working &gt; 50 ms on some step, or &gt; 1s on the first
 struct: on first turn you have 1 sec allowed on the rest 50ms
 StepiM: yep)
 StepiM: and my question is
 StepiM: verdict -  bided their time means TL or it is some game output?
 struct: timeout?
 struct: You get timeout when you dont output anything on time
 struct: can be an infinite loop
 struct: Or just taking over 50ms
 cegprakash: how to read opponent's spells from input? or is it hidden?
 struct: I'm not really understanding what you are trying to say by "bided their time"
 inoryy: I suspect "bided their time" is the output summary for "WAIT" command
 StepiM: I am talking about consol output, in Game Summary. There is written Stepim bided their time
 StepiM: Thanks a lot!
 struct: ah I never saw bided their time thats why I was confused, sorry

 inoryy: bah
 StepiM: Yep) It is not the problem. I just wanted to realize why my witch is doing nothing. That is the easiest answer! Thanks!)))
 inoryy: StepiM join #ru btw
 cegprakash: castable is used to track opponent's spells?
 player_one: castable tell if the spell is exhausted or not.
 cegprakash: so all spells in input are mine?
 cegprakash: can I see opponent's spells
 player_one: OPPONENT_CAST is your opponent's spells.
 tomatoes: can
 player_one: under actionType
 [Csongor]: all actions that have the value of CAST are yours
 cegprakash: thanks&#160;:)
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f490ee04-e1b1-4f24-a2c0-347ee1017e92">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f490ee04-e1b1-4f24-a2c0-347ee1017e92</a>
 cegprakash: I just made my ingredient enum
 [Csongor]: ghost and moon should be the first 2
 cegprakash: blue is a ghost?&#160;::D 
 [Csongor]: or curved water drop
 struct: What is last? a dorito?
 cegprakash: Thibpat said it's called Dorito in his stream
 cegprakash: so I'm using that
 cegprakash: he reached wood2 to bronze top 150 under 2 hrs yesterday with dorito strat
 tomatoes: will you stream? :eyes:
 cegprakash: not this time :D
 cegprakash: Diwali festival in India
 cegprakash: so celebrating that and coding
 struct: festival during epidemy?
 cegprakash: haha
 cegprakash: the curve slowed down
 cegprakash: coz we slowed testing :D
 Astrobytes: Happy Diwali cegprakash, may the light shine on your life
 WINWINWIN: :D Anyway, no way to convince everyone not to celebrate Deepavali
 Astrobytes: and you too WINWINWIN
 struct: Here is becoming bad
 WINWINWIN: Thanks Astrobytes@
 struct: For business
 struct: Today people started burning coffins to send a message
 cegprakash: also death rate is like 0.014% in India among confirmed cases
 cegprakash: coz our population so high
 struct: 0.014?
 struct: That seems way to low
 cegprakash: I mean 1.4%
 cegprakash: sorry
 Astrobytes: You and your family have been OK ceg?
 cegprakash: we took turns to get fever
 cegprakash: we never tested
 cegprakash: we are good now
 Astrobytes: Cool, that's good
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.bing.com/covid/local/tamilnadu_india">https://www.bing.com/covid/local/tamilnadu_india</a>
 cegprakash: only around 5.5K cases in our city
 cegprakash: in a city with more than 70 lakh population
 WINWINWIN: Bangalore is terrible&#160;:(
 cegprakash: so nobody really cares
 Astrobytes: impressive for that size of population ceg
 DomiKo: little question
 eulerscheZahl: big answer?
 DomiKo: how to make magic like emil.
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: his bot knows if I'm playing with him in arena or in test mode
 struct: With rust you can do that
 Astrobytes: Reverse engineering emil gives lime. Thus, the answer is lime.
 eulerscheZahl: rust has release mode in the arena
 struct: because of what euler said
 DomiKo: yes
 struct: you want to do the same DomiKo?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: but If I can't 
 Zenoscave: does anyone do more than BFS Casting to complete
 struct: Well use Rust or C#
 eulerscheZahl: join the rust or c# side
 DomiKo: I will pretend that I'm doing nothing
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BloodyTurtles: rust!
 Zenoscave: c#
 BloodyTurtles: no, rust!
 DomiKo: One day I will join Rust
 DomiKo: for sure
 [Csongor]: c#
 BloodyTurtles: rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust rust 
 [Csongor]: actually I code both
 BloodyTurtles: lol
 [Csongor]: but rust error messages in codingame
 Zenoscave: I can't believe I used groovy for one of the competitins. I now have no motivation to modify it
 [Csongor]: ...
 BloodyTurtles: me too, though I like rust better
 eulerscheZahl: on chromium the world chat already got unusable again&#160;:/
 struct: Its working fine for me euler
 Astrobytes: seems OK on Chrome
 eulerscheZahl: on firefox it is
 player_one: I just started a job that codes mostly in PHP, so I'm forcing myself to do this contest in only PHP so that I can learn it better.
 player_one: I don't like PHP.&#160;:-(
 inoryy: my condolences
 struct: I feel you player_one
 eulerscheZahl: torturing yourself in your free time
 DomiKo: [*]
 struct: I got a job for php, but I had to refuse
 Zenoscave: We had an insult at a previous job.It went along the lines of "You're a PHP developer"
 cegprakash: I code in js at work but I don't use it for contests
 cegprakash: JS is crap
 Astrobytes: lol Zeno
 Gabbek: :D
 cegprakash: I even have a meme page on instagram why JS is crap
 BloodyTurtles: how do I improve in bronze league?
 player_one: I actually quite like JS, though TS is even better, IMO.
 BloodyTurtles: js=bad, ts=kinda good but not really
 Robinsstudio: ts=beautiful
 player_one: Ha! My previous job was mostly TS, and I LOVED it. 
 eulerscheZahl: why did you quit?
 player_one: A lot of the fun was AWS, though.
 Robinsstudio: TS took the best of JS and threw out the annoying parts.
 Astrobytes: shouldn't that be js === bad?
 cegprakash: insta id: javascript_parithaabangal
 Zenoscave: lol
 player_one: Big bad parent company decided to disband small subsidiary company.
 cegprakash: follow me there if u hate javascript
 Zenoscave: Ah the old RIF player_one
 Zenoscave: been there
 Astrobytes: I'm too boomer for instagram
 player_one: I was given the option to join the parent company, but I didn't want to.
 player_one: Very disfunctional company.
 inoryy: jokes aside I think PHP is fine if you avoid the sharp bits and stick to well developed frameworks
 Zenoscave: inoryy I agree. Just the signal to noise ratio of sharp bits is too steep for my liking
 Zenoscave: but that could be said for generally any language
 tomatoes: modern php as scary as java
 Astrobytes: is it still all $'s?
 inoryy: no it's $$$ now
 Astrobytes: lol
 Zenoscave: PHP jobs pay well eh?
 player_one: Yeah, it's not horrible. I keep running into things that other languages can do in one or two lines that requires a lot more code in PHP.
 eulerscheZahl: no Linq in PHP?
 inoryy: I haven't worked in PHP for over 5 years now and still get random job  invites every couple of weeks
 player_one: Nope.
 Zenoscave: I am over with Linq. too slow
 inoryy: don't get where they find my profile lol but goes to show that it's quite popular 
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get any recruiters messaging me
 player_one: I get recruiters contacting me all the time. At least a couple a week.
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like i'm doing something wrong with my online visibility
 eulerscheZahl: or right, not sure :D
 Zenoscave: I get recruiters at least once a week. Sometimes multiple for the same job trying to out do each other. It's a nightmare
 Zenoscave: eulerscheZahl you are at a decent job currently, no? I'd say obscure online presence is right then
 struct: I think euler wants to join php
 eulerscheZahl: yes, decent job, no need to change
 eulerscheZahl: afk now, getting hungry
 Zenoscave: ttfn
 Zenoscave: nom times!
 struct: ttfn?
 Zenoscave: ta-ta for now
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTFN">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTFN</a>
 inoryy: talk to friend now
 Zenoscave: I've never heard that version inoryy
 inoryy: i made it up lol
 Zenoscave: that may be why lol
 struct: ihoib
 Zenoscave: ihoib?
 player_one: Well, on the plus side, I can say that I'm currently the #1 ranked PHP solution in the contest.&#160;:-)
 Avrem: how can you tell?
 player_one: A dubious honor, I know, but I'll take what I can get.
 struct: Zenoscave I was just messing with you
 struct: sorry
 player_one: You can filter the leaderboard by language
 Zenoscave: struct no worries&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Avrem, there are filter options on the leaderboard
 WINWINWIN: Click on language option then "Same as Me"
 Avrem: I'm coming for you player_one
 player_one: Go for it.
 Maliamnon: you're also #3 USA (hi from #4!)
 AntiSquid: good evening, did anyone setup offline without issues? 
 AntiSquid: i got this error&#160;:  Error:(524, 23) java: incompatible types: java.util.Optional&lt;java.lang.Object&gt; cannot be converted to java.util.Optional&lt;com.codingame.game.spell.Spell&gt;
 Aniket1298: Hello
 cegprakash: there is nothing we can do if we can do if we over cook?
 cegprakash: say like 10 doritos
 AntiSquid: what already 4k in the contest? :O
 Avrem: OK @player_one, you're too strong. Next version of the bot
 Counterbalance: AntiSquid use JDK 1.8 instead of 1.11
 aboukhri: guys what's about points , cannot understanding how theiy works
 AntiSquid: hm ... i think i installed 1.11 for something else
 AntiSquid: can i make it select 1.8 if i have both&#160;?
 Counterbalance: yes, though JAVA_HOME env var
 rmuskovets: aboukhuri what points? bonuses? 
 cegprakash: my current inventory is not given in input?
 struct: it is
 struct: on the 2nd for
 cegprakash: sorry thx
 cegprakash: i donno how I'm rank 81 in wood1 just printing random action without inventory check
 cegprakash: I just rest every 3 turns and print random in other turns
 rmuskovets: wait 'till you're in bronze
 rmuskovets: it gets a bit more tough
 OlivierRivoyre: Hi, how do we move from wood 1 to bronze?
 cegprakash: OlivierRivoyre just rest every 3 turns and print any other valid move 
 cegprakash: i think that should take to bronze
 cegprakash: I currently print lot of invalid moves but still at rank 77
 OlivierRivoyre: I'm rank 3. And nothing happens
 cegprakash: u are already above bronze
 cegprakash: above boss*
 cegprakash: u'll get promoted once 100% is done
 cegprakash: wait for the progress bar to complete all games
 OlivierRivoyre: Oh, ok, understood
 adimiclaus15: 5
 hasleron: Is there any reason to use "Wait" rather than "Rest"? 
 sirsatan: dont think so
 AntiSquid: thell ... CG lags
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: is this the mod feature euler talks about?
 AntiSquid: the hell *
 OlivierRivoyre: Yes, "REST" when all is available do an error
 OlivierRivoyre: an error made you lose
 hasleron: oh I see
 Kolinko: is there a native Mac OS ide, or can I only program and play in the browser?
 hasleron: I just tried it, it throws an error but I don't lose
 OlivierRivoyre: I may be wrong about the losing game on error&#160;:/
 jacek: you dont lose when you try to brew or cast when you dont have ingredients yet
 hasleron: Defeat Conditions
 danlars: @Kolinko You can sync your file to the codingame platform <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614</a>

 jacek: hmm just checking if the spell wont overload my inventory gave me another few hundred ranks
 jacek: maybe in this contest i will end up more than bronze
 Astrobytes: Kolinko: or just copy-paste from your IDE to the CG IDE
 grechid: where is the x y position
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized I didn't add all possible actions to my bot
 eulerscheZahl: there is a WAIT command that I completely ignore
 jacek: no point of WAIT ever eh?
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 eulerscheZahl: REST is a WAIT on steriods
 NitMpez: is there a bug in the game that you lose spells?
 eulerscheZahl: visuals...
 eulerscheZahl: check the setting (gear icon)
 NitMpez: ok
 eulerscheZahl: confused the hell out of me
 grechid: how do I do the car race though
 NitMpez: yeah, same
 Kiyanmehr: next_checkpoint_angle
 grechid: how
 roglemorph: if abs(nca) &gt; 90 thrust = 0
 roglemorph: but better
 jacek: CSB? w00t?
 jacek: thats so last week
 eulerscheZahl: or any other week, just not now
 roglemorph: the potion too hard
 Astrobytes: soften it 
 roglemorph:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :P
 grechid: :no_mouth:
 Astrobytes: Check out some of the streams for the current contest roglemorph, I think there have been a few so far, might help
 eulerscheZahl: 5 lie right now
 eulerscheZahl: live*
 Astrobytes: Otherwise, there are lots of resources on the forum for CSB
 roglemorph: yeah thats how i got here its just alot 
 Astrobytes: take it slow, don't rush
 eulerscheZahl: and my adblocker rule to hide doesn't work
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: everytime the number updates, it's visible agaion
 Astrobytes: 5 all streaming contest? Pretty cool
 eulerscheZahl: and chat is laggy again
 Astrobytes: Seems fine here
 eulerscheZahl: wait, 1 of the streams is a clasher
 eulerscheZahl: is nothing holy to them? not even a contest?
 AntiSquid: is there a bug with the timeout? if someone times out do scores still get counted for both&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, that's fixed
 Astrobytes: lol, like the people asking for help with puzzles on the forum. Sacrilege!
 AntiSquid: aha i have old version then
 Astrobytes: The github is updated now? (haven't looked)
 Scarfield: astroHeathen
 eulerscheZahl: 5h ago

 Astrobytes: Cool. Seems there may be another update coming
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Might wait til Monday before writing anything serious
 Hjax: what are they going to change? 
 struct: just small bug fix
 eulerscheZahl: related to urgency bonus shown/not shown
 Hjax: ah 
 eulerscheZahl: and recurse is surprisingly well informed about bugs for one who isn't playing
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Icebox: I think I found another weird "bug"
 Icebox: not entirely sure if inteded behavior or a bug
 eulerscheZahl: PEBCAC
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Hjax: recurse will just randomly upload a solver on tuesday, never touch it again, and win the contest 
 NinjaDoggy: nah...
 Hjax: :P
 NinjaDoggy: recurse will float mid gold/legend until the last day
 NinjaDoggy: and then jump to first with a +3 margin
 eulerscheZahl: poll is still open i think
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-who-will-win-the-fall-challenge-2020/187257">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/poll-who-will-win-the-fall-challenge-2020/187257</a>
 kovi: karliso may not be hiding for now
 reCurse: I'm not even in the poll...
 reCurse:&#160;:'(
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 eulerscheZahl: "negligence" option
 eulerscheZahl: i clicked that
 eulerscheZahl: and 2 confused users voted for me. i'll show them wrong
 Astrobytes: You could be either of the top 2 options really reCurse
 kovi: i wonder if psyho spend more than 1 day on this
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 reCurse: kovi: He's busy with topcoder
 eulerscheZahl: psyho mentioned a topcoder finale
 kovi: ah true
 kovi: vs. tourist
 AntiSquid: oh you can vote trump now
 Astrobytes: is that all week or will he come back for this
 Psyho: around 3h
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: on the CG poll 
 eulerscheZahl: good luck Psyho
 kovi: gl
 AntiSquid: gonna submit fake ballots to win the poll
 Psyho: thanks
 Astrobytes: yeah good luck
 Icebox: tome.add(new TomeSpell(new Recipe(-5, 3, 0, 0))); is how a -5 +3 spell coded, but in game the spells appears as <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/caC1Hjv">https://imgur.com/caC1Hjv</a>
 Icebox: so does the 2nd integer correspond to 3rd tier ingredient?
 Icebox: or is it a visual bug
 Psyho: ah lol
 kovi: interesting. half a dozen new japanese in the top20
 reCurse: Visual bug I think, code works fine
 Psyho: Icebox: it makes sense since in that list 3rd ingredient is worth "more" than a 2nd one
 Astrobytes: Chokudai effect?
 Hjax: i wonder if the contest got promoted on some japanese programming website or something 
 reCurse: chokudai probably brought a lot of exposure to CG last time
 Astrobytes: Yeah most definitely
 kovi: nope. none of them from the topcoder group (val, kaw, siman)
 kovi: ok, except iwashi
 Kolinko: hey, any way to speed up the testing? I click "play my code" and it takes like 5 seconds per each turn
 Icebox: I don't think it's a visual bug @reCurse because my code compares a potion with a lost of existing potions and doesn't find a match
 Astrobytes: Yeah but I'm sure there were lots of new users due to chokudai's promotion of last contest kovi
 Icebox: a list*
 kovi: i c
 AntiSquid: kawano was there 
 reCurse: There was a bug I reported Icebox
 reCurse: Sometimes the given recipe would be wrong
 Icebox: has it been fixed?
 reCurse: Deployed as of 5 minutes ago
 Icebox: :o
 Barimehdi77: is it 1 ingredient form tier-0 make 1 ingredient from tire-1? 
 Barimehdi77: and go one
 Barimehdi77: on*
 struct: You make igredients from spells
 Astrobytes: check discord Icebox
 Barimehdi77: yes but when I want to cast tier-0 to tier-1 that's mean I need one tier-0, right?
 struct: you need to check which spells will give tier 1, but yes there is 1 spell that gives 1 tier 1 for 1 tier 0
 Icebox: which channel Astrobytes?
 Icebox: which message to you mean exactly
 Barimehdi77: okay thank you
 reCurse: #fall-challenge-2020 icebox
 Astrobytes: ^
 Astrobytes: scroll up a wee bit
 Icebox: okay I finished reading through all of it
 Icebox: and I'm not sure if the bug I'm referring to is there
 Icebox: basically
 Icebox: [ 0 -2 -1 -1]
 Icebox: is the input for a potion
 Barimehdi77: why in the for loop of inventory read data twice&#160;? "for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {"
 Icebox: and if you look at github
 Icebox: such pot doesn't exist
 ZarthaxX: Barimehdi77 2 players
 reCurse: You're wrong it's there
 Astrobytes: HelpfulZarthaxX!
 reCurse: Icebox
 ZarthaxX: AstroMod!
 Astrobytes: heh, how's things man?
 Icebox: a 0, 2, 1, 1 potion?
 reCurse: Yes
 Barimehdi77: how can I know which one is mine?
 jacek: first i
 GiraffeKing: First is you
 jacek: always
 Astrobytes: First one, it's in the statement Barimehdi77
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes gud gud, gonna do some proyect with ppl from uni
 ZarthaxX: you?
 Barimehdi77: thank you guys
 Icebox: can you link me the line in github? @reCurse
 Icebox: because either you're looking at something different or I'm blind
 Astrobytes: Cool, as long as you're not doing all the work! Yeah same old crap here ZarthaxX
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java#L82">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java#L82</a>
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes well, im kind of doing most of it, sooo :D
 Astrobytes: :D
 ZarthaxX: but it's ok as its about graphs and optimization
 eulerscheZahl: i still don't understand the bug from discord that got fixed a few minutes ago
 ZarthaxX: the problem we are dealing with is called maximum impact coloring
 Icebox: oh jesus you're looking at a branch
 eulerscheZahl: meh, i guess it doesn't matter anymore
 struct: euler the price that was given on inputs was the one showed on screen, but the next input was showing as there was a +1 bonus, but the next variable said otherwise
 struct: The price did not have the +1 bonus
 Astrobytes: what's that? Like how many other vertices the coloured vertex can reach or...? ZarthaxX
 reCurse: branch?
 eulerscheZahl: meh, not even sure if i will bother adding the urgency bonus to my sim
 struct: Can't hurt
 Icebox: check discord @reCurse
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes you are given 2 graphs
 ZarthaxX: you want to color the first one 
 ZarthaxX: and you win points if 2 nodes are colored the same and are linked in the second graph
 Astrobytes: Ah, I see. Hence the maximum impact part
 Astrobytes: Cool
 ZarthaxX: yes, its cool haha
 Astrobytes: So you're doing all the work and the others are fumbling around trying to find a pencil
 ZarthaxX: nah nah haha, but i tried to do a lot before the contest obv
 Barimehdi77: if castable == 1 that's mean that the spell is castable?
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: afk 5 mins
 cegprakash: Barimehdi77 means it has cooldown.. doesn't guarantee you've enough in inventory
 jacek: i havent seen MSmits, is he in contest?
 Counterbalance: i saw his bot on the leaderboard
 NinjaDoggy: seems like he made it to bronze and then stopped for now
 ParticleBeam: he is in there somewhere
 Astrobytes: he'll be busy encoding everything into uints and optimising his sim&#160;;)
 jacek: and opening books
 Astrobytes: lol
 Counterbalance: lol
 Astrobytes: He always takes a few days out of chat to focus during contests
 AntiSquid: belated lol
 CyrilMtl: Can someone explain to me the 'taxcount&#160;?
 struct: CyrilMtl you need to pay a tax for every spell below the one you want
 struct: each tax is 1 per spell bellow the one you want
 Zenoscave: It is the number of tier-0 you gain from doing the learn
 CyrilMtl:  taxCount the amount of tier-0 ingredients you will gain by learning this spell if this is a tome spell, 0 otherwise.
 struct: so if you want to learn spell 3, you need to pay 1 tax to spell 1 and pay 1 tax to spell 2
 CyrilMtl: gain = I will get&#160;?
 Zenoscave: yes. If someone else tried to lear a later spell
 Zenoscave: learn
 struct: You gain if the spell has tax acumulated 
 CyrilMtl: Struct, that;s tomindex
 CyrilMtl: I see taxount higher than 10, how is it possible
 CyrilMtl: I see taxcount higher than 10, how is it possible
 jacek: watch replay and youll understand
 reCurse: The excess is discarded.
 CyrilMtl: there isn't way to know the bonus associated to an order&#160;?
 NitMpez: have to keep track your self
 ClockSort: they added that to the API recently, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/fall-challenge-2020-bugs-questions/187495</a>
 CyrilMtl: Thanks.
 ClockSort: in fact, TomeIndex now contains the bonus (and price has it added in)
 ClockSort: that's what I heard, anyway. Haven't tested it yet
 NitMpez: thought we were talking the +3 +1 bonus from brewing
 CyrilMtl: I think like all previous game, the first two league are far too easy, basic raw code jump both of them without time to refine/debug/learn, and suddently you are hit with all rules and have to do a full refactor of your code
 ClockSort: @NitMpez yes.
 LastRick: Never played a contest on here before but would agree. If my codes in Wood and Bronze were an indicator, I might as well have been playing two different games 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a common complaint from many CGers
 Astrobytes: Best solution seeming to be a way to skip Wood if you like
 Astrobytes: Still, you can get full rules from the github repo, but it doesn't make it any more convenient
 CyrilMtl: I would have a wait a day before opening league 2 an other one for league 3. But I guess with lots and lots of people stuck in league 1, battle would be slow, costly in cpu and $
 Uljahn: sometimes they provide a starter code which simplifies suffering a bit
 LastRick: fair point
 NinjaDoggy: is there a way to find out which tomes are repeatable casts?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java</a>
 NinjaDoggy: the github page only shows the delta for each tome
 NinjaDoggy: but not if it's repeatable or not
 Astrobytes: Yeah, not sure why they introduced the starter AI's and then stopped them again
 Xenoid: I believe every tome spell with a cost is repeatable
 Uljahn: yes, repeatables do have negative deltas
 NinjaDoggy: oh really?
 NinjaDoggy: ok thanks
 MindController: Do we have more turn time in ide than in arena?
 Uljahn: that's somewhere in the code
 Xenoid:         repeatable = IntStream.of(recipe.delta)
 Xenoid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/spell/TomeSpell.java#L14">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/spell/TomeSpell.java#L14</a>
 Beresta: wait, are the default ones repeatable too? (except first)
 Astrobytes: there're a few ms difference on submit MindController
 Uljahn: some langs are in debug mode when run in IDE i guess, so they could be much slower than in areana
 Uljahn: *arena
 MindController: When im getting timeouts in arena, its impossible to get timeouts in ide even in same conditions
 BrunoFelthes: laguages with garbage collector is very bad here at coding game
 Uljahn: ah, you should read CPU info and output it as a message in replay, you can be given 5 different types of CPU afaik
 NinjaDoggy: with the exception of the default ones i guess @beresta
 Astrobytes: 5 now? 
 Uljahn: or even 6
 Astrobytes: ugh
 NinjaDoggy: for garbage collecting languages like java
 NinjaDoggy: it's best to initialize all the memory you need on turn one
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6759abfa-256c-4d77-8679-db202e9640ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6759abfa-256c-4d77-8679-db202e9640ee</a>
 NinjaDoggy: and then update them on future turns
 Uljahn: *GHz
 Astrobytes: that goes for C#, and C++ too if you need something like MCTS nodes
 wlesavo: garbage languages*
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 Astrobytes: thx Uljahn
 NinjaDoggy: lol true&#160;:(
 Counterbalance: oh it doesn't run on potato powered i386?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 reCurse: Haven't been on the website for a while but is it insanely freezing every few minutes for anyone?
 struct: its because of chat world window
 reCurse: Drives me nuts every time I alt tab it takes forever
 struct: Since you are mod you will get freezes
 Astrobytes: Yep
 reCurse: ffffff
 Astrobytes: It's OK mostly but it has its moments
 NinjaDoggy: lol rip mods
 struct: euler mentioned that he had less problems if he uses firefox
 struct: With chromium it gets worse
 reCurse: firefox doesn't have a good file sync option
 Subsage: how is team ranking done? is it just an accumalation of points of all members, or something more averaged out??
 struct: I guess you can have firefox just for having chat open
 struct: and then ?disableChat
 struct: on the one you are using to code
 Astrobytes: Highly annoying 
 wlesavo: but its not just chat, whole page freezes
 struct: Subsage How are the school/company leaderboards computed?We take the sum of points of the top 5 players in each company/school with at least 3 players. More info in this forum's thread.
 Astrobytes: Oh you have the same issues wlesavo?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-spring-challenge-2020/152927/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-spring-challenge-2020/152927/</a>
 Subsage: I see, thanks Struct
 wlesavo: Astrobytes yeah, also with chrome 
 Astrobytes: Is this with the IDE open wlesavo?
 MindController: Repeatable spells can be cast unlimited amount of times in the same turn?
 ParticleBeam: Apparently
 ParticleBeam: As long as you have the ingredients
 CyrilMtl: in the same turn&#160;?
 yhyoxx: yup
 CyrilMtl: multiple command in the same turn&#160;? I miss that
 ParticleBeam: Not different commands, just the one multiple times.
 CyrilMtl: ok
 yhyoxx: like "CAST 70 3"
 EvoMate: oh, I missed that too, thanks
 CyrilMtl: yes I remember reading that, My code isn't that good yet&#160;:)
 yhyoxx: same ;_;
 alex-gee: can i get test data with bot somehow to debug locally&gt;
 alex-gee: &gt;
 alex-gee:&#160;??
 struct: yes
 struct: you can run the referee offline
 alex-gee: how?
 yhyoxx: enlighten us
 struct: let me see if I can explain, my terms are not very good
 struct: So referee is available here
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020</a>
 struct: If you run this java file
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/test/java/Fall2020Main.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/test/java/Fall2020Main.java</a>
 struct: And replace the Agent by your bot
 struct: for example if I wanted to replace by a cpp bot
 struct: I would compile it
 struct: and replace gameRunner.addAgent
 struct: by gameRunner.addAgent("path to compiled file", "struct");
 NinjaDoggy: alternatively, you can have your bot output the inputs each turn
 NinjaDoggy: and then run it locally that way&#160;:)
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/game-runner">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/game-runner</a>
 struct: Also when you  run it you can see the replay at localhost:8888/test.html? if im not mistaken
 Astrobytes: Also, when you have an offline system running this may be useful:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/the-codingame-api">https://tech.io/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/the-codingame-api</a>
 Astrobytes: And I would use a method similar to NinjaDoggy for offline,it should  generally be a bit/lot faster than the runner itself
 cegprakash: I'm getting promoted  to bronze with going for lowest rupee potions :D
 cegprakash: not sure if I'll get a good rank in bronze with this
 Nerchio: gratz
 Astrobytes: congrats ceg
 RockyMullet: tbh brew values is not that important
 Astrobytes: as long as you get into bronze it's fine!
 RockyMullet: since the game is over at 6 potions, being the one at 6 potions often means you win, since you have 1 more potion
 Zenoscave: Interesting Rocky.
 Astrobytes: Liking the game any more Rocky?
 ParticleBeam: I wondered about that
 Nerchio: how the hell do i even start a search when i got like 12 spells in the inventory and i don't know which to use :D
 RockyMullet: Astrobytes I pushed a first depth 2 search, I think it'll be better
 reCurse: With the first one
 RockyMullet: but I feel I'll get bored before long
 Nerchio: first spell is weak i don't want to use it&#160;:&lt;
 Astrobytes: I've not done anything serious yet, think I'll wait til Monday, and we'll see
 RockyMullet: there's not enough interaction between players, so not my kind of game
 RockyMullet: it feels like an optim game where the other player can kind of be in your way
 cegprakash: going for smallest price worked in wood2 coz I aim to end the game very quickly
 cegprakash: instead of dragging the game for 100 turns
 cegprakash: but bronze does not end with 3 potions it looks like
 Astrobytes: I'm not fussed on C4L or CalM and this triggers my meh-sense in a similar way, guess I'll try a bit though
 RockyMullet: yeah I mean, it's a CG contest, I gotta at least try :D
 reCurse: c4l had way too much randomness and bizarre interactions, calm had mind-numbing levels of frustrations cooperating with bots, this is way better imo
 RockyMullet: but I doubt this one will be my favorite contest of all time
 Astrobytes: And I can't complain about the game itself btw, just my personal opinion
 RockyMullet: reCurse yeah I still like it more than C4L
 Astrobytes: Yes, as a game it's pretty solid, I agree
 Nerchio: i was prepared for another 2d grid contest&#160;:&lt;
 RockyMullet: yeah the game is well done, just not my cup of tea
 Doju: Hey, umm... I've been trying to fix this thing for many hours now but can't find the issue
 reCurse: Not your cup of potion I see
 Doju: i'm subclassing a class
 RockyMullet: Nerchio I spent month coding a visual debugger for a CG 2D grid game...
 Doju: and defining a method in the new class
 cegprakash: how many spells can we learn
 Doju: but my instance can't use that method for some reason
 RockyMullet: and its the first game not on a 2D grid in a while, im cursed
 Nerchio: nice Rocky :D i only know how to play 2d grids :D
 Doju: python 3 btw
 Astrobytes: lol Rocky
 Nerchio: i am sitting since 2 days thinking what i wanna do in this game
 reCurse: Your inventory is a 2d grid
 Zenoscave: rip in peace Rocky
 Zenoscave: F
 reCurse: Ok I'll show myself out
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Zenoscave: nice one reCurse
 RockyMullet: reCurse yeah I though of forcing it in a 2d grid just to use it :P
 Nerchio: Doju no idea maybe you initialize it with the parent class or something
 cegprakash: okay so some dishes require 5 dorritos omg
 RockyMullet: I did it because for pacman, I made a sim in the last weekend and it was bugged and worse than my heuristic and it was frustrating to not know why
 Astrobytes: Well, I guess using matrices here wouldn't be insane
 RockyMullet: I guess I'll be able to debug old games with it, and hopefully a futur contest on a 2D grid
 cegprakash: is anyone working with bitmasks?
 Astrobytes: Not a wasted endeavour indeed RockyMullet
 Astrobytes: Not yet ceg
 Astrobytes: (me I mean)
 dbf: RockyMullet, have you checked this tool for visualization: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/kswaldemar/rewind-viewer">https://github.com/kswaldemar/rewind-viewer</a>&#160;?
 RockyMullet: I'm a big fan of debug tools&#160;:)
 cegprakash: Quaternary masks I mean
 cegprakash: bitmasks are too mainstream :D
 RockyMullet: dbf oh didnt see
 Astrobytes: lol wot
 struct: Im currently raytracing
 struct: Should be done in the next 5 years
 Astrobytes: raycasting NN I hope
 Zenoscave: raytracing some space maze?
 DomiKo: I'm parsing my weights for NN
 struct: NN is way too mainstream
 RockyMullet: depth 2 sim got me from 60th to 25th :D
 RockyMullet: not bad
 Zenoscave: Full search you mean Rocky?
 Astrobytes: Just for your own actions?
 andrefpoliveira: I dont know how to do sims :sweat_smile:
 RockyMullet: Zenoscave its not full yet, I dont check for multiple brewing yet
 Zenoscave: Me either
 dbf: RockyMullet, this one has some nice features like rewind, so you may add them to your tool also&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: andrefpoliveira: you "just" have to implement the game mechanics so you can play a turn accurately - it's not as hard as it sounds
 yhyoxx: who knew
 Astrobytes: the hard part is to be competitive enough with it&#160;;)
 reCurse: Might be the easiest sim you'll write on CG
 RockyMullet: mine so far is based on "states" with "values" in it, so a state would be something like a turn, or a single sim, then values would be something like the score, or a wall or something. Then I have a grid with buttons, where I can have tooltip showing me the values on that cell, or go deeper in another position state in case I do a sim with depth, also have a timeline to go between game turn states
 Nerchio: and then you realise you run out of time and you didnt find anything
 RockyMullet: my goal was to make it easy to use with different games, so I case use it quickly during a contest
 Nerchio: sad panda
 Astrobytes: What did you use to write your tool Rocky?
 RockyMullet: Unreal engine lol
 Doju: whatt
 Astrobytes: lol wat
 RockyMullet: I started to use unreal a couple months ago, so I felt it would be a learning experience at the same time
 Astrobytes: Fair 
 RockyMullet: it's in no way the right tool for it haha
 Astrobytes: Bit overkill though
 struct: I feel like the easiest sims I wrote on CG was STC
 RockyMullet: yeah, mostly why I didnt share it yet
 RockyMullet: a bit too much data
 reCurse: lol what
 RockyMullet: struct yeah took me like an hour, was pretty easy
 reCurse: I can think of several games with easier sim
 struct: I havent played a lot
 Astrobytes: Oware I think was the easiest I've done, maybe
 RockyMullet: I guess games with easier sim I just dont do a sim on them :P
 yhyoxx: nice
 struct: But when im saying STC im kind of joking tbh, I spent quite a bit of time on it with optimizations
 yhyoxx: what's a sim&#160;?
 reCurse: Virtual person
 andrefpoliveira: Simulation
 Zenoscave: reCurse do I need to ready my popcorn?
 reCurse: :popcorn:
 LastRick: Oof, bronze sure got tough over the course of the day
 Zenoscave: It does that usually
 Zenoscave:&#160;;)
 yhyoxx: who else is bronze on every game&#160;?
 yhyoxx: literally every game that has ranking
 yhyoxx: im terrible
 Astrobytes: Nonsense. You're learning right?
 Doju: Oh, found the bug....
 LastRick: i'm not terrible. I'm just average (which is worse iyam)
 xineohp: What's after bronze?
 Zenoscave: silver
 reCurse: Silver
 Doju: Had "__new__(self..." instead of "__new__(cls..."
 LastRick: opens in two days. So traffic is backing up here in bronze
 reCurse: Might be the biggest bronze league CG has ever seen?
 xineohp: Is anyone on silver?
 LastRick: hasnt opened yet
 yhyoxx: so some people are just gonna find themselves there when it opens&#160;?
 LastRick: good q, curse. My first contest so i dont know. but it sure is much busier than normal round these parts
 reCurse: Contests really bring the life to the site, too bad it's twice a year now
 yhyoxx: that's what's making it special
 struct: yhyoxx, yes, it opens 16-11, all the people above the boss will get instantly promoted, the boss is chosen by CG and will probably be a person in top 40%
 struct: of bronze
 Whiskee: I personally find singleplayer puzzles kinda boring, they're high quality and well made but I can do so many other things with my time
 Whiskee: a dynamic ladder is what makes this really fun to me
 struct: Whiskee there are plenty of multiplayers
 struct: Sure they are not very active
 struct: But there is a long list
 Whiskee: yeah, but a big event is always special&#160;:)
 Whiskee: there's a ton of people throwing code at this
 Astrobytes: reCurse I know right, 2 a year doesn't do this place justice. I get their reasons but...&#160;:/
 MindController: Can some1 help me a bit with c++?
 MindController: If i want this to work for about 37 miliseconds wiht code like this
 MindController: (float)(clock() - t)/(CLOCKS_PER_SEC/1000) &lt; 37
 MindController: Why does it sometimes go over 50 ms?
 reCurse: clock is bad
 reCurse: Use std::chrono::high_resolution_timer
 Zenoscave: or std::chrono::steady_clock
 Zenoscave: (might be outdated info I rarely lookinto c++ anymore)
 reCurse: Shouldn't matter
 Zhmyh: Why is clock() bad? Isn't it fast?
 reCurse: Poor resolution
 Zenoscave: right, I doubt c++20 is on CG.
 Zenoscave: or 2y or whetever the tag is
 DomiKo: MindController we don't use clock since c++11
 reCurse: Even before we didn't use clock, we just resorted to platform specific apis
 reCurse: At least not for sub-second tasks
 MindController: Guys dont be harsh, im just a student trying to have fun
 DomiKo: just saying&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Just giving advice. no harsh meant here&#160;:)
 reCurse: Intent is to be informative
 MindController: I know guys, just joking :D
 MindController: Extra info is always nice
 Zenoscave: romka messed my submit!  Had a good streak going&#160;:(
 DomiKo: legend will open on thursday?
 reCurse: Friday
 DomiKo: long time
 reCurse: Yeah -_-
 Illedan: Yeah, kinda sucks to submit in this league
 linjoehan: we don't use clock? man no wonder I can't win
 reCurse: gg
 DomiKo: long time to see real big boys come to business
 Astrobytes: lol, hey linjoehan
 linjoehan: hey man long time no see Astrobytes. my falut. I know.
 Astrobytes: Where've you been?
 linjoehan: the word busy is what I will go with. It's ironic that I code less when I get a job to code.
 Zenoscave: sounds about right
 Zenoscave: Software Engineering&#160;!= writing code all day 
 linjoehan: well I've quit and now I can code again. Well for now anyway.
 Astrobytes: Most jobs are like that. Spend more time wrangling with management.
 icecream17: Okkkkk finally won all 10 games in wood 1
 Astrobytes: all 10?
 icecream17: uh yeah
 Zenoscave: first 10
 linjoehan: the first 10
 Astrobytes: ah
 icecream17: ohhh oops
 linjoehan: you will come to bronze soon then
 icecream17: if i happen to win all my games ill let you know lol
 NinjaDoggy: i went 25/25 in wood 1 with a bfs :D
 icecream17: oh what ... i am actually winning all my games
 NinjaDoggy: haven't changed my bot since then&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: you'll be in bronze soon, you were near the top no icecream17?
 linjoehan: I got to bronze by adding a random in there somewhere
 icecream17: Oof, 27 in a row then lost #28
 icecream17: Still amazing though
 linjoehan: Is Bronze all the rules?
 linjoehan: I should just go look myself I suppose
 Astrobytes: yeah
 linjoehan: So I should ask what is this game based on?
 Astrobytes: Spice Road something
 icecream17: 5 people above the boss, wonder what's the record
 reCurse: Should look up one of the times CG got DDOS'd by CSB promotions
 Astrobytes: linjoehan: Century: Spice Road
 reCurse: Maybe around 150 or 200.
 linjoehan: thanks
 icecream17: oh yeah bronze!
 Astrobytes: reCurse: "one of the times" - heh, plenty to chose from there
 Astrobytes: I swear I remember them saying they would "do something about that"
 reCurse: Maybe they did, hard to know
 Astrobytes: This is true.
 Astrobytes: Anyways, I'm out for today, nice to see you around chat (and contest) again reCurse&#160;:)
 reCurse: Same&#160;:)
 Cappefra: did the available input just change?
 reCurse: A few changes happened earlier today
 icecream17: Oh, in the summary of new rules, it says "All the rules are now unlocked!"
 Cappefra: where's the boilerplate for the input reading?
 icecream17: source code: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020</a>
 icecream17: oh, uh
 reCurse: First backup your code elsewhere
 Inc_: Something is wrong with the game message:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.postimg.cc/rsfw6RGq/codingame-fall-challenge-2020-message-bug.png">https://i.postimg.cc/rsfw6RGq/codingame-fall-challenge-2020-message-bug.png</a>Everything else is fine (gained ingredients, graphics).
 reCurse: Second click the button looking like an undo arrow top right of code
 reCurse: It will reset to template
 Cappefra: oh thanks!

 icecream17: wow, i totally misunderstood that question
 Inc_: But you can't see the game summary there.
 Rdjdv: I discovered that you can play by hand there: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://spicee.mattle.online/welcome">https://spicee.mattle.online/welcome</a>
 tomatoes: it seems message generated after actions taken

 CyrilMtl: it is not possible to get the seed to use it in our code&#160;? to generate randon but repeatable random&#160;?
 reCurse: Not possible
 rwilson: CyrilMtl - you can create your own though --- and many people will hate you if your bot is good&#160;;)   
 Illedan: CyrilMtl, just use the stats of the input. Should be random enough
 ShinzoSin: hi, could anyone tell me how to get id af all avalible recipes in FALL Challenge? I have id but that only one recipe...
 BrunoFelthes: is there any way to expose gc in javascript?
 CyrilMtl: good idea
 icecream17: gc?
 Maliamnon: ShinzoSin - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java#L82">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Deck.java#L82</a>
 BrunoFelthes: my javascript is timing out with 40ms because of garbage collector
 icecream17: javascript has a garbage collector...
 BrunoFelthes: i want to force it between rounds
 reCurse: Nice try, won't work
 ShinzoSin: yeah cool, but I want to know what recipes are avalible at given time, and I can't understand how to know what on plate, so that i could compare options in my code
 icecream17: there are 42 recipes,
 icecream17: but
 icecream17: you can only see 6 every turn
 Illedan: BrunoFelthes, you have no CPU power between rounds. Better to save everything in some static context and hope you don't hit max memory
 icecream17: tomeIndex, in the actionCount lines, shows the index of the tome
 icecream17: from 0 to 5
 icecream17: you can see all the tomes unless you're reading input incorrectly somehow
 icecream17: oh wow, i got 6 potions, which ended the game, but i still lost
 NinjaDoggy: wow... bots are weaker than I thought hm...
 NinjaDoggy: learn the first tome available for the first 10 turns, and then bfs for fastest potion
 NinjaDoggy: does quite well lol
 icecream17: i wonder if there's another way to figure out the fastest way to make a potion
 Illedan: Another than what?
 NinjaDoggy: you can probably do some matrix inversion stuff
 NinjaDoggy: but with good tome selection
 NinjaDoggy: potions get made really fast
 lNitsua: I'm planning on doing a matrix based solution
 lNitsua: minimal bfs work involved, slightly more maths
 icecream17: i did an inefficient and inaccurate while-for-for loop, but it works pretty well
 icecream17: the loops aren't very long so
 ShinzoSin: thx @icecream17
 ShinzoSin: I found my mistake hx to you
 ShinzoSin: thx*
 icecream17: you mean a bug lol
 icecream17: i have a lot. well not now, i think ive fixed them all
 ShinzoSin: no, thing hwat yu've said aboutu reading input incorrectly
 icecream17: oh yeahwell, you're welcome =)
 ShinzoSin: now i finally got the hang of it
 icecream17: I'm wondering how to calculate to fastest way still, i've got a test case already, maybe this could be a puzzle
 NinjaDoggy: personally, i'm just trying all possible moves and it does fine
 NinjaDoggy: obviously a lot of optimization can be done, but brute force is already decent
 Doju: Wow
 icecream17: hmm, i don't really see how it could be done other than brute force
 Doju: my crappy bot that doesn't even think about the possible potions
 Doju: put me at rank 4 atm hahah
 Doju: oh wait there are leagues yeah right that makes sense
 icecream17: i wonder if it's possible to tell if it's impossible to do a potion
 JamesOnnen: it is
 NinjaDoggy: it's basically always possible to do a potion
 NinjaDoggy: unless you overcrowd inventory space
 Zenoscave: ^ this
 icecream17: oh yeah, that makes sense
 icecream17: i forgot about the base spells
 icecream17: hmm, maybe the base spells could be optimized
 JamesOnnen: ac8e06e7-9c08-43dc-8416-79034d54d361
 icecream17: oops i pressed test instead of play my code
 Zaphus: how much better would it be if Codingame highlighted the matches you timed out in, vs the ones you just lost...&#160;:-)   searching
 Cappefra: is it wanted that the price of a brew already includes the tomeIndex?
 Cappefra: I was working under the assumption I would have to consider the value of a brew to be price + tomeIndex
 icecream17: The protocal says that price includes the urgency bonus, if that's what you mean
 maxymczech: Guys, can you answer a question about learning spells please...
 icecream17: ok?
 maxymczech: If on the same turn me and opponent want to learn same spell, what will happen?
 RohanasaurusRex: I'm pretty new to programming and this website looks really nice. Does anyone happen to know any websites similar to this one that I could also try? Thanks
 Cappefra: oh yes ok @icecream17, I misread it then
 icecream17: tecnical details says you both will succeed
 Nerchio: Rohan i will save your time searching, stay on CG :p
 icecream17: "When both witches perform the same action, they both reap the rewards for that action. This applies namely to potion prices, the urgency bonus, the read-ahead tax, and learning spells."
 RohanasaurusRex: Oh ok lol
 maxymczech: @icecream17 Thanks but rules also say "Once a witch has memorised a spell, that spell dissapears from the tome completely and is no longer available to the other witch"
 icecream17: yeah, but it's at the same time so....
 icecream17: Both witches memorize the spell
 NapTown: that would apply to subsequent turns, not the same turn
 maxymczech: Ok thanks!
 icecream17: and then, the spell disappears
 maxymczech: @RohanasaurusRex There are many sites with coding problems. Try Codewars. Matlab has "MATLAB Cody"
 maxymczech: Also hackerrank
 maxymczech: Those are I know about
 maxymczech: Those are the ones I know about
 RohanasaurusRex: Thank you

 Beresta: ouch, so if you get 6 potions first but have less rubies you still lose&#160;:(
 lNitsua: So just found that linear algebra is not the move
 lNitsua: anyone here doing trajectory optimization?
 lNitsua: I think this is an ideal trajectory optimzation game, I'm just new to the topic
 icecream17: i just diff the inventory and delta, and add until there's no negative amounts for the recipe
 LastRick: Beresta: Yeah, guess because it forces the player to think long term rather than many, quick potions. Which makes for a more complex game
 Beresta: LastRick: yea, I've made a wrong assumption&#160;:)
 Beresta: rank 38 so far
 Zaphus: Is there any way to know how many potions your opponent has brewed so far?
 blasterpoard: track how many times his score changed
 Zaphus: ah, clever&#160;:-)   
 Ekaon: Sooo&#160;! Can we talk about the random choices that launch you trhough the leagues&#160;? x)
 dreadylein: mh&#160;?
 dreadylein: the bug fixes&#160;? :D
 blasterpoard: actually, there's not that much randomness in the game if you code your bot properly
 Ekaon: I created a selection of valid choices, and I just choose one of them randomly. Eventually, I finish first
 maxymczech: Does it work in bronze league?&#160;:) 
 Ekaon: It's longer, but yes
 Beresta: well you won't get higher than bronze this way anyway
 Beresta: and bronze is where it actually starts
 Zenoscave: I somehow doubt that strategy will continue to work
 Beresta: wood is like education
 Ekaon: It was just for fun while i'm working on true algorythm
 dreadylein: well if you actualy statistical evaluate this part you allready have a mc, i guess it isnt optimal but for sure useable to some degree
 Ekaon: Actually, if you combine this with a bit of other logique it achieve a lot
 Ekaon: But it only works because there is a lot attempts
 dreadylein: dont think i can follow you , what do you mean&#160;?&#160;:)
 Ekaon: I mean, to go through the wooden, I needed to select valid choices, and add a random rest some times to let him no always rest when he has no other choices
 dreadylein: yeah, random valid choice is fine for getting to bronze thats right&#160;:)
 dreadylein: used the same for unlocking the rules
 Ekaon: Now that I'm in bronze, I need to remove some others choices relatively to the tax
 maxymczech: Funny thing, I am in bronze, didn't code learning spells yet. I have compared 2 stratgies - go for recipes with highest price, and go for fastest recipes. They both suck, but 'fastest recipes' actually outperforms 'biggest price'
 Ekaon: No, I mean, I should reallly create the tree parsing to find the best cast to the faster brew. But, then, I could try again to use random x)
 Ekaon: Yeah, because fastes end the game
 maxymczech: WIth 'biggest price' I was in 1200 place, with 'fastest' in ~700
 Ekaon: In wich league&#160;?
 maxymczech: bronze
 Ekaon: You take in account the fact that the opponent can steel the brew&#160;?
 maxymczech: No, I only do A* search for each recipe and select action towards either fastest or most expensive
 Ekaon: Maybe it would help to take in account that the brew list can change each turn to correct your goal
 Zenoscave: blasterpoard do you go for multi brew search yet
 maxymczech: What's a "multi brew"?
 Zenoscave: Find multiple brews in the search and plan routes many turns ahead
 Ekaon: It's kinda funny that this tornament comes, because I'm working on chessengines since feew days 
 Ekaon: And there's a lot of tree parsing to determine the best moves list
 blasterpoard: Zenoscave lol, why do you think I search for a brew?
 blasterpoard: sim and eval
 blasterpoard: brewing is just a part of eval
 maxymczech: @Ekaon Tomorrow I will modify my search algorithm to incorporate learning spells and repeatables, then will see what comes to mind
 Zenoscave: Right but do you stop eval after first brew
 maxymczech: good night everybody!
 blasterpoard: no
 LastRick: night
 Ekaon: good night&#160;!
 Zenoscave: night! I think that's what I'm missing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nah
 blasterpoard: I can tell you that right now I search to depth 20
 blasterpoard: then I eval
 blasterpoard: but that's just a random number and I haven't tested any other values
 PatrickMcGinnisII: damn, i dropped 1000 places overnight
 Zenoscave: lol it got competitive PatrickMcGinnisII
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well I didn't submit a treebot yet
 dreadylein: true, the amount of people actively playing is pretty nice&#160;:)
 Ekaon: Is it possible to have several files&#160;? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so anyone below top 2k isn't trying
 icecream17: top 1000 yesssss
 icecream17: oh no i jinxed it i just lost 2 games
 Zenoscave: lol icecream17 never say success during submit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: too many pomegranate mojitos
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ugh, i come back later
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fall challenge should have been drink mixer challenge.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: strange brew
 yhyoxx: aah mojitos 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 Zenoscave: ttfn
 yhyoxx: take care
 hbouillo: Hi! I've got a question. Is it allowed to pre-compute data and hardcode it into a bot? It would save computing time and I'm wondering if it's considered cheating.
 blasterpoard: it's allowed and a lot of people do it
 dreadylein: there are size limits for your file aside of that its fine
 dreadylein: thats why you get 1 seconde on the first turn mainly&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: just be careful to keep your code under 100000 chars
 dreadylein: to setup stuff
 hbouillo: Yeah I saw that, but I feel like I could still blow that second up haha
 hbouillo: Thanks, I'll keep the possibility in mind!
 hbouillo: Also the execution speed isn't always consistent, I've made a few tests and I got about +-20% execution time variations&#160;:|
 dreadylein: with which language&#160;?
 hbouillo: Python... Yeah I'm asking for it
 blasterpoard: hbouillo there are 3 types of machines that run your code
 dreadylein: can be your garbage collector
 blasterpoard: afaik
 lambrosk: Guys quick question
 lambrosk: How can i print out my own stuff in java without getting DQ in game
 rcar: print to stderr
 hbouillo: blasterpoard what do you mean?
 zapakh: System.err.print()
 lambrosk: game will only let me print brew cast etc
 lambrosk: oh thanks
 blasterpoard: hbouillo not all the games are executed on the same machine, or even the same model of CPU
 hbouillo: That makes sense for contests of that size, but it does suck when each turn is time limited
 blasterpoard: you can measure the time in your code
 hbouillo: Yes, indeed! It can just get unfair if you get unlucky on your battles and get dq'd because you planned on using 100% of the time you got, but you got slower machines
 hbouillo: The baked data helps a lot though. Thanks for the answers!
 tomatoes: opponent use same machine
 blasterpoard: it's not "unlucky" if it happens 30% of the time and you know about it
 rcar: random assignment of CPU power seems to be the very definition of luck
 hbouillo: Opponent, but not other battles. I'm not very familiar with codingame's scoring system yet, but it seems possible to me that the you can get unlucky on the batlles that would grant you a large amount of points. We don't get enough battles to have a fixed and reliable percentage to base our strategy on
 blasterpoard: hbouillo at the end of the competitoin, there will be a large amount of games that will determine the final standings
 hbouillo: Ah, I see! Good to know!
 blasterpoard: until then, if you think you're unlucky, you only need to promote to the top league
 hbouillo: That is a good point.About that btw, will there be silver/gold leagues open on the fall contest later?
 NinjaDoggy: just get legend :stuck_out_tongue:
 NinjaDoggy: -blasterpoard 2020
 blasterpoard: silver on monday, I think
 dreadylein: yep should be 16. 
 hbouillo: Nice!Just saw you're top of the leaderboard, good job!
 blasterpoard: NinjaDoggy usually, it takes more effort to go low legend -&gt; high legend than wood-&gt;low legend
 blasterpoard: so you're technically correct
 NinjaDoggy: ok yea this is true
 NinjaDoggy: can confirm gold -&gt; legend is the real hump
 NinjaDoggy: if you don't promote day 1
 Zenoscave: That's a big if
 NinjaDoggy: i have a lot of experience with last day legend&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: Is that so&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: yep, and usually it comes with a t-shirt&#160;;) because gold boss get so inflated
 NinjaDoggy: gets*
 Zenoscave: New strategy
 Moze97: should i write str for the output in the print function&#160;? 
 Moze97: it is not working with me ......
 yhyoxx: emil. i believe in you
 Moze97: it worked finally 
 Moze97: thanks 
 Zenoscave: I'm coming for that top 20 NinjaDoggy watch out
 NinjaDoggy: ._.
 NinjaDoggy: zeno just curious, how much of your bot's strength do you think comes from tome learning
 NinjaDoggy: vs cast/brewing
 Zenoscave: 95&#160;% cast
 Zenoscave: I'd guess
 Zenoscave: My Learning is awful
 Zenoscave: and yours?
 Lachrymosa: If I can make it to silver I'll be happy :3
 NinjaDoggy: um... 100% cast
 NinjaDoggy: i hard coded first 10 turns learn the free one XD
 tomatoes: same
 zapakh: I thought I saw some bots doing that!
 NinjaDoggy: it's surprizingly good vs top bots
 NinjaDoggy: because it can get lucky, and get an early lead
 zapakh: More to work with, for sure, when you fill your spellbook upfront
 NinjaDoggy: going to be kinda tough to improve it honestly...
 NinjaDoggy: evaluating tome combos is going to be tough
 Zenoscave: huh
 zapakh: what?
 Zenoscave: Seeing if the front fill helps
 Zenoscave: showed me another weakness of my eval
 zapakh: Ooh maybe I should try that
 zapakh: It'd be funny to watch two witches with the same 10 spells
 LastRick: is there a limit to how many spells you can learn?
 BenjaminUrquhart: 42
 BenjaminUrquhart: not including ones you start with
 LastRick: woah. the round is almost over if you tried to learn them all
 yhyoxx: haha 
 MaroIsLife: \
 yhyoxx: fen a maro
 dreadylein: meh .. still dont know what i wanna implement :D
 Zenoscave: well...
 Zenoscave: that's crazy
 dreadylein: mh?
 Zenoscave: Thanks Ninja. That helped a lot
 BenjaminUrquhart: learning first 10 spells made things worse for me
 BenjaminUrquhart: first 5 works though
 Zenoscave: I'm sure it depends on bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: what's funny is learning exactly 6 spells makes me time out
 BenjaminUrquhart: no more, no less
 BenjaminUrquhart: exactly 6
 tomatoes: specific game or always?
 BenjaminUrquhart: always
 BenjaminUrquhart: probably because java classloading funny
 BenjaminUrquhart: cause learning new spells after doing a real action is fine
 tomatoes: i started with 10 and it kinda works, left it as is
 icecream17: Oh, I havent considered doing learn AND cast to do a spell....
 icecream17: oh well good night
 mojojojo: Anyone else can access the forums? I get a login error
 Xenoid: I can access the forums
 mojojojo: Oh okay thanks for the info

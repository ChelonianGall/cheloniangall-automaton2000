 PatrickMcGinnisII: It's midnight, do you know where your cat is?
 eulerscheZahl: next to me, calling for attention
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Mine are dreaming about being large enough to enact their murder plots against me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I &lt;3 the little murderers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Got 3 of them, how many do ya'll have?  or should i say, how many cats claim you as theirs?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My GF has 4 inside and like 5 outside.  I have a dog/cat door so they do as they please.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My keyboard thief is outside atm
 eulerscheZahl: i have 1 cat, she hates other cats
 eulerscheZahl: and a neighbor's cat that regularly visits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no one else? that's sad
 GGGFreshy: fuck'
 GGGFreshy: fuck
 GGGFreshy: sad
 GGGFreshy: fuck
 GGGFreshy: so hard
 GGGFreshy: im stupid
 GGGFreshy: im literally stupid
 GGGFreshy: is that fine?
 GGGFreshy: start please
 GGGFreshy: oh my gawd
 GGGFreshy: god nipples
 GGGFreshy: sorry
 GGGFreshy: bye
 jrke: please don't spam
 eulerscheZahl: i missed a kick opportunity. but i'll take the next one, you've been warned
 GarethEddies: good afternoon
 King_Coda: lol imagine spamming
 King_Coda: cringe
 King_Coda: Anyways
 King_Coda: gn
 SuryaTheOP: hloo
 one_tskk: hello
 SuryaTheOP: any indian
 SuryaTheOP: where are you all guys from
 GarethEddies: Brisbane, Australia
 SuryaTheOP: nice to meet you
 tduck973564: MELBourne
 SuryaTheOP: most of you in Australia 
 tduck973564: yeah because its 3:40 ghere in victyoria
 JethaBoi: yo
 KNELE: yo btch 
 eulerscheZahl: next 50-50 decision will be a kick
 PatrickMcGinnisII: where' automaton when u need him
 SuryaTheOP: tduck i got it
 jacek: happy Caturday
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :crying_cat_face:
 JimmyJams: its 2:37 am, you know what that means right?
 JimmyJams: that means its coding tiiiiiime
 Westicles: Power of thor golf update is done.  Only lost 5 this time
 Westicles: not POT, chuck norris actually
 eulerscheZahl: if they change thor validators, i'll drop hard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Westicles you are only on the leaderboard 27 times
 Westicles: For chuck norris?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup
 Westicles: oh, well yeah I had to do them all apparently. 
 tduck973564: australia aint gona cop iot
 tduck973564: no australia aint gonna cop it
 tduck973564: no aussie aint gonna cop it 
 tduck973564: anymore

 envifly: some tell me if this is too hard for coc or not
 envifly: lol
 envifly: someone*
 Mr_BlueBird: not too hard
 Mr_BlueBird: u have to remove duplicates from string
 envifly: i can throw in other duplicates as the actual lyrics of the song
 envifly: &gt;:)
 jacek: oO
 IvesL: i suggest in some cases, some words/lyrics could be an extension of the "beat", let's say in your validator3, "scoop is cute cute cute", replace the beat "poop" with "oop", which is inside the word "scoop" to add some more difficulty
 IvesL: envifly ^
 envifly: that doesnt work, because it would consider "sc" to be a lyric
 envifly: also i dont plan on making it any harder..
 IvesL: but you can do it 
 IvesL: up to you
 envifly: coc shortest mode is so python biased
 envifly:&#160;:(((
 jacek:&#160;:(((((
 geppoz: well ruby seems best
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(((((((((((((((((((((((
 punter147: c++ dabbler here, i was also a bit disappointed by this observation envifly but luckily we were taught basic python in college, and now by learning other generous peoples' submissions, i am really enjoying the beauty of python. but as geppoz said, ruby almost always has an edge in shortes mode contests, even over python submissions. I guess its time to learn some ruby. wouldnt hurt tho as rails is still in demand i guess.
 envifly: i wouldnt learn ruby just for coc lol... you can do what you want
 BlaiseEbuth: So stop crying and assume you gonna lose...
 MiyamuraIzumi: take a lot of time trying to use GA for ML, and end upda using Heuristic&#160;:(
 jacek: GA for ML?
 BlaiseEbuth: mars lander I guess
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes
 MiyamuraIzumi: can't converge on test 2
 MiyamuraIzumi: *test 3
 darkhorse64: Even if you do not converge during the first turn, you can play the best found move and keep on searching.
 MiyamuraIzumi: my best move sucks
 MiyamuraIzumi: it ain't go anywhere
 MiyamuraIzumi: it seems that my fitness score is not good 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MiyamuraIzumi assuming you have read:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/</a>
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes
 MiyamuraIzumi: just my implement is not so good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I haven't done it, but either your sims are all crashing or you aren't forcing a big enough mutation\
 MiyamuraIzumi: some bug in my simulation, and maybe my selection for GA is not good
 MiyamuraIzumi: I now have new idea
 MiyamuraIzumi: but I think I will play with other games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: k
 MiyamuraIzumi: as I have speed too much time on ML
 IvesL: hey steve
 IvesL: i have watched a lot of stuff about GA, but always having a bad time applying it to my problem
 IvesL: do you have any tips that i can practice on?
 MiyamuraIzumi: I just fail on ML
 MiyamuraIzumi: anyway, for tips: the mutation rate help on vary the search space to avoid local maxima
 MiyamuraIzumi: but if mutation rate are too high -&gt; GA will behave like a random search and hard to converge
 MiyamuraIzumi: for cross over depend on problem, but cross over will help to have quicker converge
 MiyamuraIzumi: a good fitness funtion is very important, (I fail on this on ML)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: success or fail, then how bad did it fail... eg. dist. to dest.
 MiyamuraIzumi: so for GA: make it converge quicker, but still try to expand the search space
 MiyamuraIzumi: when I can find a solution, it can perform quite good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: may work on code vs zombies
 MiyamuraIzumi: but when it is not converge, my fitness score won't go anywhere
 MiyamuraIzumi: I mean:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think i would rather crash than run out of fuel
 MiyamuraIzumi: on some cases before I converge, the moves are very bad that later,  when I find a converge, it doesn't have good enogh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you are further along than you think, g/l
 PatrickMcGinnisII: come back when the GA experts are online
 MiyamuraIzumi: for test n3, it never converge&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: yes
 MiyamuraIzumi: thaks
 tekki: ask for Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but it's a very bad idea
 IvesL: yea very bad idea
 darkhorse64: Depending on your level of expertise on GA, I'd suggest that you solve ML1 with GA. I know it's overkill but it's very simple (just one variable) and it converges on the first turn. The fitness function is also very simple: vertical speed &lt; 40 m/s
 jacek: portugal scored more goals eh
 KiwiTae: jacek which multi?
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 KiwiTae: heyy I am puzzled by this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/uJ75tB4u">https://pastebin.com/uJ75tB4u</a>in coders of the caribbean referee, looks dangerous 
 Philbot: what does it do
 KiwiTae: its all the &amp;&amp; first then ||?
 KiwiTae: im always adding () because i never remember&#160;:")
 sprkrd: yes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence">https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence</a>
 KiwiTae: sprkrd thx &gt;&lt; i shouldda google that im tired 
 sprkrd: i like to think of the &amp;&amp; as a "product" and of the || as a "sum", that way I can always remember the precedence&#160;:)
 LazyMammal: you can also replace &amp;&amp; and || with * and + for some comparisons and get the same result!
 sprkrd: the problem with * and + is that you don't get short-circuit behavior
 sprkrd: so it can backfire if you're doing bounds checking or similar
 LazyMammal: yep.  but sometimes you want to include a boolean as a cofficient term.  then it's good to know&#160;:)
 sprkrd: yeah, in those case i'd even argue that * and + have clearer semantics
 linjoehan: is it a known bug that causes this chat to scroll around slowly? or is it just me
 sprkrd: i've been having a weird experience with the chat today, but not slow scrolling around&#160;:(

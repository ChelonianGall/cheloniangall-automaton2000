 Quidome: What's the problem?
 eulerscheZahl: he has thrust=100 in both if and else section
 Quidome: that's true :O
 Quidome: I am at 83% of bender 4 now
 Quidome: fixed one bug and hashmap optimaization
 Quidome: but still time out on the remaining 
 eulerscheZahl: it was never supposed to be hard to get 100% correct&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but many struggled
 eulerscheZahl: but great that you are making progress
 Quidome: I see it as a two step problem, first find the optimal path and than the function stuff
 Quidome: two seperate puzzles so to say
 eulerscheZahl: yes, maybe
 Quidome: I get's really complicated when you try to optimize over the two at once&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but the function stuff might even be more effective if you do not take the optimal path
 eulerscheZahl: go a bit further and then back
 eulerscheZahl: or bump into a wall
 Quidome: ah, the last remark is interesting
 Quidome: well, first 100% :D
 Quidome: struggling with Rust, and references in structs
 Quidome: I think i am gonna love Rust but not there yet...
 dbdr: it seems Illedan and eulerscheZahl did a good job of pushing up the Tulips boss&#160;:)
 dbdr: Quidome: can I help regarding Rust?
 dbdr: what level are you?
 dbdr: my general advice would be: think if you can design you data in a way that does not require references in structs
 dbdr: it's often possible and much simpler
 Quidome: I think i am intermediate at the moment, at Rust that is. But taking the time to understand everything.  
 dbdr: yes, definitely takes time, take it easy&#160;:)
 dbdr: I also still have a lot to learn
 Quidome: Well, you are doing quit well already in the contest with Rust
 Quidome: nice work
 dbdr: thanks!
 dbdr: what are you working on?
 Quidome: bender 4 and Tulips
 dbdr: and what's causing difficulties?
 eulerscheZahl: not trying atm dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i got dragged into this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30122730">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30122730</a>
 dbdr: cool, I did both. well just starting on tulips
 Quidome: At the moment no special issues, i will keep you in mind. Thnxs!
 eulerscheZahl: and to copy the link i replaced the path of the file i just wanted to submit. but thanks to parcellite i can quickly restore that
 dbdr: yeah, I'm sure you'll pass the boss easily when you set yourself to it eulerscheZahl
 dbdr: so you like parcelite?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: trying to win $0 I see :D
 eulerscheZahl: of course, i always wanted to have $0
 dbdr: good thing is, you can have it an infinite number of times
 dbdr: and share it with everyone
 eulerscheZahl: i won't give you my $0, they are MINE!
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder sends me 2 emails for each submission i make. that's annoying
 eulerscheZahl: imagine getting an email each time you submit a bot
 eulerscheZahl: one "we received your bot"one "you submit finished"
 eulerscheZahl: and one that you passed the virus check
 Nerchio: would use up all my gmail space before first week finished&#160;;)
 dbdr: =&gt; filter that deletes it
 dbdr: mess it up and delete your whole inbox
 dbdr: =&gt; inbox zero&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and the feedback system sucksi get a score of 1. no idea if it takes too much time or my submission format is incorrect or whatever
 eulerscheZahl: last contest it took me a while to figure out that i set the wrong filename
 eulerscheZahl: because you can't just compile all codefiles :rolling_eyes:
 dbdr: maybe 1 is the best score, like in some school systems&#160;:)
 Yongkai: Y'a un mec chaud dans ta salle
 Yongkai: *oups wrong chat 
 eulerscheZahl: speak english or go to the channel of weirdness
 dbdr: at least Yongkai. without context... :D
 dbdr: #ru&#160;?
 dbdr: someone seriously argued in the 19th century that "french is the natural language of the brain"
 dbdr: other languages are artificial
 eulerscheZahl: oh, right: topcoder doesn't like Console.Error
 eulerscheZahl: and that's another nonsense: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/s5nhbf">https://prnt.sc/s5nhbf</a>i'm not first. i just got 100 on the virus check and the actual scoring didn't finish yet
 eulerscheZahl: aaand it's a score of 1 again&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: :rage:
 Nerchio: why don't you just get a score of 100
 Avifire: can someone help me? i am stuck at the nextCheckpointAngle in coders strike back
 Avifire: my code:
 Avifire: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fffc57bb-442a-4f81-a225-c3afbdb0a888">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fffc57bb-442a-4f81-a225-c3afbdb0a888</a>
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl 09:54AMhe has thrust=100 in both if and else section
 eulerscheZahl: that was 30min ago and you still have it
 Nerchio: you need some brackets for if else
 eulerscheZahl: also Quidome asked you to specify "i'm stuck"
 Avifire: even when i change the value it still doesnt work
 eulerscheZahl: what means "doesn't work"playing poorly? crashing? compiler error?
 eulerscheZahl: don't be like my mom saying "the PC is weird"
 Avifire: no the value stays at 100 the whole round
 Avifire: or 0 the whole time
 eulerscheZahl: stupid topcoder, i didn't realize you get 4 emails...first you get a score of 1, then it's progressed and evaluated to your real score
 eulerscheZahl: only about 15min after the submit you get the real score
 eulerscheZahl: did you change the thrust to 0 for both if and else to get the permanent 0?
 WINWINWIN: eulerscheZahl can u tell me how to enable optimizations for C#?
 eulerscheZahl: you don't
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/36b47751-7682-48e6-9470-41937bea2696">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/36b47751-7682-48e6-9470-41937bea2696</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it's debatable if it is of any benefit
 eulerscheZahl: and it's runtime optim, not compile time
 WINWINWIN: why the args length part?
 eulerscheZahl: the first call from CG is without console args
 eulerscheZahl: so you artifically set some when you call your own program to detect that it's the 2nd run
 eulerscheZahl: and terminate yourself
 Spifflejedi: Hi o/is there a way to increase the vertical size of the console output of CG games? on my browser I can only change the size on the horizontal axis.
 eulerscheZahl: the 2nd run has args.Length &gt; 0, meaning it's alraedy optimized. so it plays the game
 eulerscheZahl: Spifflejedi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-enhancer/59441</a>

 Spifflejedi: :thumbsup:
 Spifflejedi: thx
 Nerchio: oh
 Nerchio: didn't realise i need something like this
 eulerscheZahl: you can also name your submits and stuff like that
 Spifflejedi: selection of opponent needs to be done manually though it removes the search opponent ui it seems
 Spifflejedi: but super usefull add on
 WINWINWIN: Anyone actively doing Fantastic Bits?
 dbdr: oh, eulerscheZahl in wood1 aka legend
 eulerscheZahl: silver maybe
 eulerscheZahl: added some basic blocking
 dbdr: yeah, that's the level of the boss I would say
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454687169">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454687169</a>take that!
 dbdr: yeah, you beat me in my sub
 dbdr: while I beat ErisSMSO
 dbdr: definitely bots with holes in their strat&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you are submitting too
 eulerscheZahl: but you timeout there
 eulerscheZahl: lots of money
 dbdr: what is lots?
 eulerscheZahl: 140
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: and you end the game early
 dbdr: I saw top players doing big combos
 dbdr: several k in one move
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 dbdr: yeah, looks like a real timeout
 dbdr: I have fixed depth 3 minimax right now
 dbdr: did I push you up? :D
 b0n5a1: hi o/
 b0n5a1: free until 10.05&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/441380/PACMAN_CHAMPIONSHIP_EDITION_2/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/441380/PACMAN_CHAMPIONSHIP_EDITION_2/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no, i promoted myself
 dbdr: my tool assumes -1 is a timeout, which is not true here, annoying
 dbdr: gg then
 dbdr: there is no consistency on this on all multis, is there?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 dbdr: an no undersal way to detect a crash?
 eulerscheZahl: many write "timeout" in the game summary
 eulerscheZahl: in hypersonic you disintegrate
 dbdr: and many have -1
 dbdr: showing crashes on the last battles would deffinitely make many people happy
 dbdr: and reduce their server load
 Avifire: my pod is not boosting. can anyone help me
 Avifire: my code
 Avifire: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bce468ac-0db3-4e22-8c39-901a18eeb232">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bce468ac-0db3-4e22-8c39-901a18eeb232</a>
 Avifire: /me
 wlesavo: you need to actually print "BOOST" 
 Avifire: where
 eulerscheZahl: on a side-note: BOOST isn't worth much. by todays game standards CG wouldn't introduce such a command that can only be used once per game
 eulerscheZahl: in your print statement. print the text BOOST instead of a number
 Uljahn: iirc there was no boost during csb contest
 eulerscheZahl: right, you are a veteran member
 Uljahn: :older_man:
 JBM: wasn't it SHIELD that was not in the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: let's read some post mortems <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithms-coders-strike-back-game/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=csb">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithms-coders-strike-back-game/?utm_source=codingame&amp;utm_medium=details-page&amp;utm_campaign=cg-blog&amp;utm_content=csb</a>
 eulerscheZahl: it talks about shields
 eulerscheZahl: but boost only ranking-wise, not as a command
 JBM: ok then
 MSmits: Did Jeff rank high? I forgot who won the csb contest
 MSmits: btw... funny how anyone in the top 30 will probably wreck all the contest bots&#160;:)
 MSmits: that's definitely not true for the other multis
 eulerscheZahl: the PCR contest winner is the gold boss now
 AntiSquid: very optimistic, top 30 only?
 MSmits: oh cool
 MSmits: so it's true for PCR as well
 MSmits: AntiSquid probably more, I was being conserrvative
 eulerscheZahl: but these contests had no public referee
 MSmits: btw... I did not think PCR gold boss was easy to beat at all
 AntiSquid: republican
 eulerscheZahl: so only a few players managed to build a sim
 eulerscheZahl: which is crucial
 MSmits: AntiSquid ewww
 AntiSquid: lol
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl true
 MSmits: oh, sorry
 MSmits: true eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: wow, you are 3rd in onitama already :o
 MSmits: yeah, I'm 2nd basically, got a new eval with untuned constants
 AntiSquid: order is irrelevant, eulerscheZahl mention means extra eulerscheZahl mention chance from AutomatonNN because he loves eulerscheZahl
 AutomatonNN: what is the most community contest?
 AntiSquid: what is the most eulerscheZahl mention AutomatonNN&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: hmmm
 eulerscheZahl: but that bot likes to start sentences with my nick as it's a popular word to start a sentence
 Nerchio: so yesterday i pushed a 3 year old bot from silver to gold
 Nerchio: hehe
 MSmits: good job
 eulerscheZahl: great job. and where are you?=
 Nerchio: ~150 gold
 AntiSquid: that guy will open his email and think: wow finally!
 Nerchio: yea i was wondering if he gets an email for that
 Nerchio: would be funny indeed
 eulerscheZahl: CodinWhat?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Nerchio: ghost in the cell
 AntiSquid: i mean he does get it, unless he stopped using it
 eulerscheZahl: i deactivated these email notifications
 Nerchio: probably would think its spam or something
 MSmits: cg has a tendency to go into spam folder though. I had great trouble trying to get it through the filter
 Nerchio: or codingame trying to get him back after 3 years xD
 eulerscheZahl: only for comments on my contirbutions (puzzle solutions, puzzles, puzzle comments)
 eulerscheZahl: i remember your lost tshirt winning email
 MSmits: you just want to read "that's awesome euler" every once in a while
 Nerchio: lol
 eulerscheZahl: know if i should take an action
 MSmits: yeah that doesn't happen anymore thankfully euler
 Nerchio: i'd love to play some less-known contributions but how do you guys find time for that
 Nerchio: there is enough popular multis already :p
 MSmits: I've been at this for almost 3 years now I think
 eulerscheZahl: i started 3 years ago when there were only 10 multiplayers
 MSmits: wait then its only 2
 eulerscheZahl: 2 for you MSmits
 MSmits: ye
 Nerchio: lol
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i'm close to 4 already :scream:
 MSmits: so anyway, if you spend 30 hrs a week doing this between contests, you get some multis done
 eulerscheZahl: time flies
 MSmits: even so i tend to hang around with a multi for 2 months average i think
 Nerchio: ye makes sense
 MSmits: so 2 months, then i move on to the next
 MSmits: onitama will be shorter I think
 Nerchio: you're done with ooc then?
 MSmits: i never revisit contests
 eulerscheZahl: took me about a year to catch up back then with limited game choices
 MSmits: or i havent yet anyway
 AntiSquid: i forgot where i check when i made my account
 eulerscheZahl: now i have some unplayed games again
 MSmits: contests are semi involuntary. I have less fun with contests than with multis, because I have no choice, I kinda have to do them right then
 MSmits: even though I am obsessed with a different multi at that time
 Nerchio: hm
 Nerchio: i am enjoying ghost in the cell at the moment but its definitely more fun when its live contest with hundreds of people writing their bot at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: i agree
 MSmits: thats a fun part of it, but the fact that it's not the game I am obsessed with atm, actually detracts more from the fun for me
 eulerscheZahl: lots of chat activity and you want up 10 ranks below where you parked the bot in the evening
 AntiSquid: ya i see, i only reach 3 years of CG in June this year, yet MSmits is a time traveler and did 3 years already
 Nerchio: but we will see for future contests, if there will be one i dislike i might change my mind ^^
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: Nerchio dont get me wrong, contests are great. I just like the more relaxed version of writing bots also
 eulerscheZahl: you can always skip one. or call it a day without going all in
 MSmits: i did that on utg
 AntiSquid: 21 March 2018 MSmits, so just above 2 years
 Nerchio: lol eulerscheZahl "dont invite me to  clash of code" xDD
 Nerchio: nice description
 MSmits: AntiSquid thanks
 eulerscheZahl: i only wanted to reach legend at UTG
 eulerscheZahl: try to copy a part of that text Nerchio
 Nerchio: i did and it didnt work
 Nerchio: so i rewrote it
 Nerchio: :x
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: could not summon the motivation. My head was bursting with ideas for yavalath and uttt at that time. I just couldn't let that go
 MSmits: it happened during ooc too, but I had a month
 eulerscheZahl: right to left character at the beginning and then the text backwards
 eulerscheZahl: sadly it's not allowed for usernames
 eulerscheZahl: would be fun to disable tab completion
 eulerscheZahl: we also have this gem:
 eulerscheZahl: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 MSmits: is that a tilde
 MSmits: aaaaaaa
 eulerscheZahl: no :imp:
 MSmits: it's stabbin me!!
 Nerchio: lol
 Nerchio: nice

 MSmits: i remember when automatonnn was doing that
 eulerscheZahl: stops after about 10 messages
 AntiSquid: ah nvm
 AntiSquid: only works in private
 AutomatonNN: hey guys i am still in silver league there
 MSmits: stay there
 Nerchio: btw where can i check acc creation?
 MSmits: check?
 Nerchio: like date
 eulerscheZahl: go to the profile, hover over the ranking graph
 eulerscheZahl: left-most = creation
 Nerchio: september 10 2016&#160;;)
 Nerchio: veteran
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw, if you want to see someone who did lots of multis in a short time, check trictrac account
 Nerchio: wait why does it say i am legend in 3/51
 Nerchio: ah its 
 Nerchio: legend achievements rather than
 AntiSquid: achievements?
 Nerchio: leagues
 Nerchio: I am the championFinish 1st in any contest.
 Nerchio: unless you can do it on some random stuff
 eulerscheZahl: it is, trying for years :D
 MSmits: yea&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: smits was close
 AntiSquid: i missed top 50 again lol
 MSmits: yeah, got 2nd
 eulerscheZahl: now he's stacking tshirts from his failed attempts to win that achievement
 MSmits: :P
 AntiSquid: only ones that reach it are the ones who probably don't care about it anyway
 Nerchio: yeah probably
 MSmits: I think some care. Agade had some really happy PM
 MSmits: and i have read others
 MSmits: but yeah if tourist wins, he's gonna leave a short message and leave
 AntiSquid: there's also the create a community contest achievement which most also won't get
 AntiSquid: much easier to get though
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if they will remove the creator's achievement now that community contests are officially dead
 MSmits: they shouldn't
 eulerscheZahl: i'm slow at typing :D
 AntiSquid: you can still create one and present them a finished game&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AntiSquid: so should keep it, it's not unobtainable
 eulerscheZahl: but it's hard to find the right level of complexity
 Nerchio: so last few contests where community made and they are going back to cg made?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 MSmits: they could have a legacy category for achievements
 MSmits: list of unobtainable achievs
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>from mean max to pikaptcha
 eulerscheZahl: these are the community contests
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't call ocean of code and crystal rush (UTG) community contests though
 eulerscheZahl: neither do i
 eulerscheZahl: note the long gaps before and after mean max
 eulerscheZahl: they had to build the SDK first
 Nerchio: so what's the expected 'rate' of challenges now?
 MSmits: unclear
 AntiSquid: unexpected
 eulerscheZahl: 2-3 per year
 Nerchio: :D
 eulerscheZahl: source: thibaud forum post
 MSmits: there's also company sponsored contests that appear suddenly
 MSmits: sometimes they open up to the community
 MSmits: as opposed to just the company
 Nerchio: they call next one "spring" challenge which kind of suggests they want might want to do 1 per season
 eulerscheZahl: but often these semi-private contests are heavily based on existing games
 MSmits: thats true
 MSmits: Nerchio dont think that means anything
 MSmits: just means it's in the spring
 eulerscheZahl: and the spring contest was planned for end of winter but shifted by 2 months
 AntiSquid: what's the reason though
 eulerscheZahl: i guess they didn't finish it in time
 AntiSquid: and how different can it really be from pacman? :D
 Nerchio: i wonder if it will be in some way similar to the kthulu thing
 JBM: how do you even multi a pacman
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you were close, that's why they removed it
 MSmits: Nerchio good guess
 eulerscheZahl: but we'll see
 AntiSquid: with the little info we have we are all very close to knowing what it is
 MSmits: it's probably going to have lots of BFS
 MSmits: that's my guess
 MSmits: get your BFS ready
 eulerscheZahl: "how to multi pacman"there was a mr and mrs hackman contest on riddles that would answer your question
 eulerscheZahl: but the site is dead
 AntiSquid: power ups in the cover image, knowledge of similar contests (hackman, kutulu ...)
 JBM: what's hackman
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/riddlesio/hack-man-2-engine">https://github.com/riddlesio/hack-man-2-engine</a>
 eulerscheZahl: there are visuals somewhere (searching now)
 Nerchio: do you guys think it will be 1v1 or more?
 JBM: like, a semi-famous variant?
 AntiSquid: probably the reasoning is that most people didn't play the other similar stuff 
 MSmits: Nerchio could be either, but my guess is 4p
 JBM: how about reverse pacman
 JBM: 4 players control the ghosts
 JBM: the game IA moves pacman
 MSmits: i see two pacmans in the pic
 JBM: first to get him actually wins
 AntiSquid: isn't the CG reverse engineering puzzle a reverse pacman of sorts?
 JBM: shhhhhhhhh
 AntiSquid: and we just had ooc
 AntiSquid: don't want more hidden info games
 JBM: i like them
 AntiSquid: i still didn't fix my UTG bot even
 MSmits: AntiSquid I like the hidden info if it is a strong feature of the game
 AntiSquid: and have plentiful bugs in occ
 AntiSquid: ooc *
 MSmits: I don't like it in wondev woman, where it's an annoying detail
 JBM: it's a refreshing change from the usual just bf the sim kind that's prevalent around here
 AntiSquid: for me wondev woman wasn't that bad, it was sort of trollishly fun, you can pull off some funny moves
 AntiSquid: for example only move 1 unit for first half of the game
 MSmits: yeah it seems ok, i just didn;t like that part of it
 AntiSquid: and then surprise!
 eulerscheZahl: you can still play that mrs hackman at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jmerle/ai-bot-workspace">https://github.com/jmerle/ai-bot-workspace</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's the contest where i never got my robot prize&#160;:/
 MSmits: sucks
 AntiSquid: you could always buy that thing
 eulerscheZahl: not the same
 AntiSquid: now with lockdown maybe it's a good way to spend time
 MSmits: what kind of robot is it
 eulerscheZahl: aruduino emoro pro robot kit
 MSmits: ah cool
 AntiSquid: you could always look up arduino robots on youtube, there's lots of tutorials, maybe you can make a pass the butter bot
 MSmits: I've participated in a robot contest for a few years with students
 MSmits: I mean an international contest

 MSmits: it's been a while since I last did that, I think 7 years ago
 AntiSquid: ja ik akzeptier cookies - language similarities there
 Nerchio: damn 10 year old students
 MSmits: hehe yes
 Nerchio: the netherlands is next level
 MSmits: mine were 10-12
 MSmits: sry 11-13
 MSmits: upper edge of the age range
 Nerchio: i always considered 'students' to be in university but i guess it might be everyone 
 MSmits: yeah, i use it for everyone
 MSmits: I don't teach younger ones anymore currently
 MSmits: just 16-18 yr olds
 MSmits: though this contest was fun. We stayed in school til after dark coding and building bots
 MSmits: kinda wore me out though
 AntiSquid: but that's how school should be like
 AntiSquid: if you don't see a point in being there then it's useless
 Nerchio: unleash the geek = crystal rush?
 MSmits: it's fun when the students are supposed to build a bot to deliver a polar bear to a corner of the map and then they build a giant catapult that launches it there 80% of the time
 AntiSquid: yes
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: there are also some games that will never return

 AntiSquid: could always make a newer slightly more complex one of the graph challenge
 AntiSquid: and same goes for the capture the balls challenge 
 kovi: i miss great dispatch
 kovi: even though our competation was taken over (by hardcoders)?
 emigr2k1: I always get captcha im not a robot it's disgusting
 AntiSquid: play some puzzles instead, no captcha
 Uljahn: just make a solving captcha bot, there should be a clash for that :smiley:
 AntiSquid: if you don't finish in 15 minutes start over
 eulerscheZahl: kovi no hardcoding at TGD. some solved it perfectly in 10s while we had 50
 kovi: well, it might have been easier since it turned out to be perfectly solveable
 AntiSquid: so top solutions were bruteforced?
 eulerscheZahl: i wouldn't call it bruteforce if you found a clever way
 eulerscheZahl: but they were solved online and with a provable optimal score
 AntiSquid: but were they solved with a bin packing algo&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: kind of, i don't know the full details
 aCat: TGD?
 eulerscheZahl: the great dispatch
 aCat: we got such game oO
 eulerscheZahl: not anymore
 eulerscheZahl: was an optim game where you had 50s to solve it
 aCat: ^^'
 eulerscheZahl: 100 trucks, list of boxes with given wieght + volume
 aCat: oh, maybe I remember it
 eulerscheZahl: assign the boxes to trucks such that you don't exceed the max volume on any truck
 eulerscheZahl: and try to get the weight per truck as uniform as possible
 eulerscheZahl: score = max weight - min weight, lower is better
 aCat: hmm, we don't gaet xp for approving puzzles?
 aCat: bu&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: no, they removed that feature
 eulerscheZahl: in the hope that less shitty games get approved
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if that even was a motivation for some
 eulerscheZahl: and a proper review can be a lot of effort
 struct: How much was the exp?
 struct: like 15?
 eulerscheZahl: 15
 aCat: so that's the reason even less people are willing to approve/refuse stuff than before ;p
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile you still get 250 for creating a boring clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: same as for a multiplayer with nice animations, which is a lot more effort
 aCat: yep
 eulerscheZahl: and requires more skills, which XP stands for
 aCat: that is wrong 
 aCat: we should rebel ;p
 Astrobytes: Has anyone broached that subject with CG? Seems grossly unfair.
 aCat: or constantly ping Thibaud about this 
 eulerscheZahl: i want to get paid! in XP!
 eulerscheZahl: i commented on the clash vs multiplayer XP on the forum 2 or 3 times
 struct: I want to see my puzzle at least on Puzzle of the week&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: it's a feature to have same XP it seems
 struct: I guess now its impossible since I deleted the account though
 Astrobytes: Some feature...
 MadKnight: hey struct
 struct: hi
 MadKnight: what account did u delete&#160;?
 struct: The one that created Yavalath
 MadKnight: did u create it from another account&#160;?
 struct: yes
 MadKnight: Yavalathby undefined
 MadKnight: lol
 MadKnight: but why&#160;?
 struct: legend or delet
 MadKnight: u can undelete it 
 MadKnight: if u still have session cookies somewhere
 Astrobytes: Was it UTG struct? I can't remember
 struct: yes astro
 struct: I dont have the cookies anymore MadKnight
 MadKnight: they don't actually delete it they only unlogin u and set nickname to ""
 MadKnight: maybe u logged from another browser&#160;?
 Astrobytes: You waited til last day or something iirc
 Astrobytes: Hi MadKnight
 MadKnight: iirc&#160;?
 MadKnight: what's iirc
 MadKnight: tell me Automaton2000
 Astrobytes: "If I Remember/Recall Correctly"
 Automaton2000: the top of the leaderboard
 MadKnight: oh right
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000 iirc isn't the top of the leaderboard
 Automaton2000: the difference between the two
 ALIM: Can someone help me with an easy puzzle?
 ALIM: Any ideas how to decode in disorderd first contact?
 Mykes: yare yare
 struct: The statement explains it quite well
 ALIM: The statement explains it only about the encodind which i have already done. What about the decoding in C language?
 struct: The example they give is the decode
 ALIM: Yeah but there is any explanation of how to decode

 IAmNoob: hi
 AntiSquid: i think the main issue with clash is that it's overvalued by the newer part of the community
 AntiSquid: so ofc they want xp equal to multis for it
 AntiSquid: anyway to get the numbers up and keep people active i guess
 darkstar: hi @IAmNoob
 Uljahn: b-but clashes don't teach you anything useful
 IAmNoob: yeah
 ApenJulius: (just started out) whats the difference betweeen max and imax?
 Uljahn: letter i?
 ApenJulius: doing the descent
 AntiSquid: need more context @_@
 ApenJulius: jsut kinda dont know why its imax and max
 AntiSquid: how you name your variables is your choice
 ApenJulius: oooooooh
 ApenJulius: thanks haha
 Uljahn: ah, i guess it's max element vs the index of a max element
 ApenJulius: things starting to make sense
 IAmNoob: there would be usefull if you can put a limit of space or a limit of time so they must make it better @Uljahn
 IAmNoob: I say that if you want to make a program that make Quick Sort, all of the programmers will just use he sort() function
 IAmNoob: or if you want to make that the sum of divizors to be in O(n*log(n))
 IAmNoob: not just in O(n)
 IAmNoob: or OI(sqrt(n))
 Uljahn: like valuing cocs by memory or time asymptotic complexity?
 Uljahn: ah, i get it
 IAmNoob: yeah
 IAmNoob: like so
 Uljahn: that's what multis are all about i guess
 IAmNoob: multis?
 Uljahn: ai bot programming
 IAmNoob: aaaaa
 IAmNoob: yes
 Uljahn: you're given strict time limits and memory bounds
 IAmNoob: yeah
 Uljahn: then you compete&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: i would like to see something like this in a clash
 IAmNoob: to have a time limit
 IAmNoob: or complexity limit
 wlesavo: just try regular puzzles
 IAmNoob: i tried
 wlesavo: there are quite a few you cant brute force
 IAmNoob: yeah but i sad about comunity
 IAmNoob: how we could make some
 Uljahn: just don't take clashes seriously, they are good for having some fun
 IAmNoob: yeah they are simple
 IAmNoob: (not complex)
 IAmNoob: i mean
 Uljahn: cheap and quick dopamine shot :relieved:
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 pavveu: Hi, I got question, about game tree searches - minimax, mcts, etc. in C++. If every node in tree corresponds to certain Board instance, should i have 1 instance of Board class and pass it into recurrence search using "move()" and "undoMove()" functions on this specific instantion of Board class, or should  i create every time a new Board instance in current node, or it doesnt really matter?
 aCat: depends on the game
 aCat: in many cases it is more efficient to make move and undo
 aCat: or in case of mct even without undo
 aCat: *mcts
 aCat: you just copy root and apply all moves along the way - this is how it is usually done
 RobertSARPILIIII: buenos aires
 aCat: if the game is with imperfect information or randomness you have to do it as you usually can't properly store game states
 MSmits: pavveu assuming you have perfect information, it depends on the size of the gamestate
 MSmits: Usually if it is 128 bit or smaller, I store it on the tree node
 MSmits: it also depends a lot on how costly it is to apply a move
 MSmits: you dont want to have to do it again and again
 MSmits: if it is expensive
 MSmits: for example, in UTTT applying a move is very cheap and most people have a gamestate of size 320 bit. That means it's cheaper to just reapply the move every time you go down the tree
 pavveu: @MSmits thanks for reply, so if i understood correctly, large state + fast move, I can just simply call minimax, etc every time i traverse down, otherwise, its better to store whole minimax tree in memory?
 ZarthaxX: minimax tree in memory doesnt make sense
 ZarthaxX: that just exploeds
 ZarthaxX: too much memory
 Astrobytes: You build the tree as you go as opposed to storing it for minimax
 Astrobytes: hi Zarthington
 ZarthaxX: astrobyto good sir waddup
 Astrobytes: Not a lot man, you good?
 ZarthaxX: pavveu it doesnt make sense to store the tree of minmax as yu arent coming back to the nodes
 ZarthaxX: except you do iterative deepeening, but still, too much memory
 ZarthaxX: storing the tree makes sense for MCT
 ZarthaxX: MCTS
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes good good, have to do a project with a team for uni today
 ZarthaxX: so i need to code some things to be ready
 MSmits: pavveu I am mostly talking about MCTS
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX cool, is this a 1-person makes all the effort kind of team or a proper team? :P
 MSmits: in minimax it may make sense to use a small state for transpositions though
 ZarthaxX: well so far i have done all
 ZarthaxX: but just code
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol
 ZarthaxX: i know my team is decent
 ZarthaxX: one works and doesnt have time in the week
 ZarthaxX: the other idk.. problem is he is more a math guy
 ZarthaxX: so i dont want him to code lol
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 Astrobytes: good move lol
 ZarthaxX: also as i coded i found a more efficient way of doing smth
 ZarthaxX: which i told them, they didnt understand
 ZarthaxX: i told the teacher
 ZarthaxX: he didnt understand
 Astrobytes: ffs
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX:  thought the teacher knew already
 dbdr: tell us, let's see if we understand&#160;:)
 MSmits: you're a student in this situation?
 dbdr: CG is overestimating my progress rate:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/TKklDj.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/TKklDj.jpg</a>
 pavveu: @MSmits all right, sorry, should be more precise, its certainly 2 different things, so for now, 
 pavveu: @ZarthaxX thanks, understood
 dbdr: pavveu I think the honest answer is that it depends, and ideally, do both and compare them&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: dbdr it's something about linear algebra ol
 ZarthaxX: MSmits yes
 MSmits: ahh i see. it's a similar question pavveu. The best answer is to try both and benchmark, but in many cases it is obvious. With large states, dont make new instances, with fast moves and undo, do make new instances
 MSmits: also some games have moves destroy information so thoroughly that you have no choice but to keep an entire copy of it
 dbdr: actually I was thinking about this, related to MSmits question whether MCTS is always better
 dbdr: the fact that minimax is efficient when using undo in some cases
 MSmits: mcts can do this just fine
 dbdr: you can't really do that in MCTS I think
 MSmits: why not?
 MSmits: go down the tree, apply and undo
 MSmits: keep just 1 copy of it at the top
 MSmits: to reset once you're done with the rollout
 MSmits: you dont even have to undo
 pavveu: @dbdr okay, thanks, will do that then
 dbdr: but minimax explores one area at the same time
 dbdr: does not undo back all the way to the top
 MSmits: no, but it undoes a lot more often
 dbdr: so in some contexts that could be more efficient
 MSmits: say with uttt, you apply 40 moves, then it's one copy action to reset
 dbdr: if you use undo in MCTS, you would undo more than minimax
 MSmits: yeah thats why i think you should not
 dbdr: sure, but copy could be much expensive than undo
 dbdr: say you have a huge state
 MSmits: memcpy is fast though, state would have to be very very large
 dbdr: and small ations
 dbdr: actions
 MSmits: on CG i don't know an example of this
 dbdr: well, that's where it's down to numbers
 MSmits: it's down to numbers yeah
 dbdr: it's possible, but it requires evidence
 MSmits: also, I don't even know if what I am doing lately is even mcts
 MSmits: there is no monte carlo
 MSmits: I just go down the tree using UCT, eval at the end and reset
 MSmits: it's deterministic
 dbdr: I know, I would call that BTS
 dbdr: Biased Tree Search
 dbdr: Minimax is unbiased, explores everything equally
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdVXkSdhwU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBdVXkSdhwU</a>
 ZarthaxX: MC came from random moves :thinking:
 ZarthaxX: or what
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: Monte Carlo = Random
 dbdr: so yes
 ZarthaxX: i mean it's always better to put someheuristic 
 ZarthaxX: MSmits that video is relevant to this talk? :P
 MSmits: In my case i just make sure I do a good sampling of the tree, but it's no longer random
 MSmits: he said BTS
 ZarthaxX: i know
 ZarthaxX: lmao
 MSmits: :P
 ZarthaxX: but it's no loner random coz your rollout is an eval
 ZarthaxX: longer*
 MSmits: well you can also do a random rollout to x turns and then eval
 MSmits: x is just 0 for me
 dbdr: also, what about a tree that's very wide and shallow
 ZarthaxX: i know
 Uljahn: ZarthaxX: main idea is bad heuristics are worse than pure random i guess
 dbdr: shallow =&gt; many iterations and copies in MCTS
 MSmits: dbdr that's basically yavalath
 dbdr: sorry wide =&gt; ...
 dbdr: and shallow means few undos
 dbdr: so that could tip the scale towards minimax
 MSmits: it does indeed, in yavalath
 ZarthaxX: Uljahn but i think you should drop the pure random idea always and make some domain specific stuff
 dbdr: interesting
 ZarthaxX: :thinking:
 MSmits: minimax is by far the easiest way to get into it, mcts takes a lot of work to get past issues
 dbdr: the book corrects the limitations of MCTS?
 MSmits: mostly yes, but my bot without book is also in the top 3
 MSmits: among some minimax bots
 MSmits: the thing is, even if you dont have a bok
 dbdr: interesting, so comparable strength
 MSmits: you still have a book
 MSmits: let me explain
 MSmits: most bots are very deterministic
 dbdr: need to :D
 MSmits: even without books
 MSmits: so you get insane rps-effects
 MSmits: that make measuring bot strength impossible
 dbdr: I see
 dbdr: you'd need to compare bots after N random moves&#160;:)
 dbdr: to vary the states
 MSmits: yeah
 ZarthaxX: rps?
 MSmits: rock paper scissors
 ZarthaxX: ah iok
 MSmits: you'll see the same game repeated many times just because bot X always makes 1 mistake in some often visited state
 dbdr: that's a benefit of games with maps and seeds
 dbdr: every game is different
 MSmits: definitely
 MSmits: i like this about Onitama
 MSmits: bandas too
 MSmits: simple games in the way that I like, but still every game is different
 MSmits: Onitama is very entertaining to watch replays of
 MSmits: also funny that if you play vs AI, some games are 3 frames&#160;:)
 MSmits: vs default AI
 dbdr: default AI is stupid?
 MSmits: that ofc, but the reason you can end it in 3 frames is because almost every turn is near the end game
 MSmits: if you make a mistake
 ZarthaxX: wow
 ZarthaxX: onitama is that brutal?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: lemme try and find a particularly short one
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454751386">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/454751386</a>
 MSmits: 7 frames
 eulerscheZahl: there is no splatter in onitama
 eulerscheZahl: vindinium is more brutal :P
 ZarthaxX: hi toady
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 eulerscheZahl: the default AI takes a capturing more if possible. otherwise just a random valid move
 dbdr: reminds me of beginner mistakes in chess
 dbdr: mate in 3 moves
 eulerscheZahl: i'm curious: onitama has a fallback rule if there is no valid move. did you ever encounter such a situation?
 eulerscheZahl: in that case you pass a card without moving
 MSmits: I don't watch a lot of replays, but I did not enounter it no. I did encounter crashes when i did not handle this situation well in my bot simulation
 MSmits: so it happens in sims at least
 eulerscheZahl: interesting, wasn't even sure if it's possible
 eulerscheZahl: or if the referee handles it properly :P
 dbdr: yeah, didn't think MSmits could write bugs either
 MSmits: lol, too many bugs
 eulerscheZahl: right now i'm crashing too&#160;:/
 MSmits: _ eulerscheZahl I am thinking hard to come up with a good situation where this happens
 eulerscheZahl: the _ :D
 MSmits: hehe yeah
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if automaton will ever get trained again
 MSmits: is he not being trained now?
 eulerscheZahl: so it wouldn't even matter if not
 ZarthaxX: jolindie n PM 
 eulerscheZahl: no, only by manual trigger, takes a few hours
 dbdr: Automaton will learn to start sentences with _ eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: ah
 eulerscheZahl: i know ZarthaxX, even a long one
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: i like his emotes lol
 ZarthaxX: evaluation function sleep
 eulerscheZahl: no long contest
 eulerscheZahl: i totally agree on that
 eulerscheZahl: "It’s been a while since we’ve seen MJS — their last post was 1 year ago."what weird forum update is this?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: Mary Jane?
 MSmits: who is MJS
 dbdr: "This is the first time X has posted — let’s welcome them to our community!"
 dbdr: didn't see that feature before
 eulerscheZahl: because it's new
 eulerscheZahl: since today?
 Astrobytes: Bet they pushed it yesterday, being Friday and all :P
 eulerscheZahl: i have a feeling like they often change something on friday afternoon
 dbdr: classic
 Astrobytes: And just sit and pray all weekend
 dbdr: maximizes the amount of testing by the community :D
 Astrobytes: lol, let us find the bugs
 pb4: There is also "It’s been a while since we’ve seen MJS — their last post was 1 year ago."

 MJS: Hi then
 pb4: I'm surprised there were so many MCTS
 pb4: hi MJS&#160;:)
 pb4: Welcome back after more than 1 year&#160;! :d
 dbdr: :D
 MJS: Thanks. I have run each and every contest. But not reacted on the forum
 dbdr: Did "Quote" disappear from the forum?
 pb4: You have a "reply" button dbdr
 AntiSquid: quote pops up when you select a piece of text
 eulerscheZahl: nohighlight a text and click "quote"
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 pb4: TIL
 AntiSquid: that 0.01 extra typing speed
 dbdr: right, thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: i always lose on typeracer
 dbdr: seems buggy if you want to quote a quote
 MJS: pb4 proba * (1 - proba) maximizes the information retrieved by the sonar
 eulerscheZahl: csc -vMicrosoft (R) Visual C# Compiler version 3.3.1-beta4-19462-11 (66a912c9)
 dbdr: will this mean faster C#?
 eulerscheZahl: but still mono installed:Mono JIT compiler version 6.4.0.198 (tarball Tue Sep 24 01:24:35 UTC 2019)
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if it's updated yet
 sadek11: hii
 AntiSquid: hi
 dbdr: MJS I was thining to think about that, but then sonar was a minor case in my bot. I just thought about it quickly, for 2 sectors, it does not matter right?
 AntiSquid: what happened to sadek0 to sadek10&#160;?
 dbdr: and for 3+, I thought the most probably must be a good choice
 dbdr: a unlikely sector will almost surely respond No, with little info gained
 eulerscheZahl: still running with mono
 AntiSquid: sonar the second best sector, good or bad idea?
 eulerscheZahl: Console.Error.WriteLine((Type.GetType ("Mono.Runtime")&#160;!= null));prints true
 eulerscheZahl: why not the most likely one?
 KiwiTae: eulerscheZahl o/
 eulerscheZahl: hi kiwi
 dbdr: I think most probable is better. but would be better to have the proof&#160;:)
 MJS: The ideal use would be splitting the possible positions in 2 balanced sets. If you still consider n positions, the best sector is the one that contains about n/2 positions
 dbdr: right, so if one sector has 50%, it's ideal
 MaciejF: Hi everyone! Is there a way to read game's seed? I'm playing UTTT and there is a "seed" variable when clicking on "options". I'm using C++.
 IananasMian: hihi
 eulerscheZahl: my detection rate the most likely sector is the best to scanhowever the overall situation might change this (e.g. exclude some mines so you don't have to surface and turn around)
 AntiSquid: hi
 eulerscheZahl: my =&gt; by
 KiwiTae: IananasMian hey O/ wow another taiwanese fellow
 AntiSquid: MaciejF why is game seet important for UTTT?
 AntiSquid: seed *
 KiwiTae: u look cute
 ZarthaxX: lol
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX sup
 ZarthaxX: dont do that here kiwo
 ZarthaxX: doing some algebra stuff
 ZarthaxX: you?
 KiwiTae: ZarthaxX we are in my office haha
 MaciejF: I wanted to try to use it as a seed for rng
 dbdr: won't the top sector always be the closest to 50%?
 KiwiTae: shes my friend
 ZarthaxX: wat
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 ZarthaxX: i see
 IananasMian:&#160;; p
 MJS: You could refine, considering the other sources you might have. If you are also about to launch a torpedo, you should not consider the cells affected by the torpedo when choosing your sonar sector
 sadek11: sadek11 has a secret
 ZarthaxX: hey IananasMian
 KiwiTae: learning python 
 MJS: Anyway, who cares. Nobody had both sonar and torpedo ready at the same time
 IananasMian: umm? ZarthaxX
 AntiSquid: lol lame KiwiTae, i thought you jumped in at random girl you don't know, was about to applaud for not holding back but nevermind
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 dbdr: no true, in some situations everything was  chaged at once
 dbdr: *charged
 MJS: I am still in silver. No MCTS around: people just fire what they have&#160;:)
 MSmits: hi MJS
 MJS: Hi MSmis&#160;:)
 MSmits: so apparently you did not post anything on the forum for  a year
 dbdr: everybody is talking about that :D
 AntiSquid: people throw their sub at the enemy sub trying to win eh?
 sadek11: antisquid
 sadek11: where you are from
 AntiSquid: sadek11 and his 10 brothers
 sadek11: hehehehhe
 MJS: No, sorry. Most of the contests were during holidays. I had to code on a smartphone, cheating with the screen resolution. I forgot to give feedback. Every time. *sigh*
 AntiSquid: i live in a bitter cloudy part of the world with a bit of sunshine these days but can't go outside sadek11
 MJS: Scottland?
 MJS: lol
 Astrobytes: No that's me
 MJS: lol
 sadek11: nice place though
 AntiSquid: idk, what would scotts call it?
 AntiSquid: sadek no clash invites, not playing that @_@
 sadek11: hahhah okayy
 MJS: By the way, my children enjoyed our trip to Scotland. They can even pronounce 'Edingburgh'
 AntiSquid: visited grey friar's graveyard?
 Astrobytes: Without that extra 'g' I hope?&#160;;)It's a nice place, well, in parts :P
 MJS: e-din-bor-ou
 AntiSquid: did you hear scotts moan about english a lot&#160;? if not then you probably went to a different part of the world
 Astrobytes: e-din-buh-ruh if you're Scots!
 MJS: And just don't say 'lok' for 'loch' in front of the youngest.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Awesome
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid we don't moan about the English. Not all the time.
 AntiSquid: i heard a lot of fun jokes :D
 MJS: They also had their first Halloween party, in Inverness
 Astrobytes: Inverness?! Wow, you went for the loch or do you know people up there?
 MJS: Just wanted to see Scotland. I am from Britany. Scotts are regarded as the most prestigious celtic people. I wanted to meet them
 MJS: So we landed at Newcastle, the Glasgow, Skye, Harry Potter's train (*joke*), Inverness, Edinburgh, and back
 Astrobytes: lol, yes, my ex was also from Bretagne, I'm familiar&#160;;)Ah that's great, my favourite part of Scotland is the Hebrides (Skye , Lewis etc), it's beautiful
 MJS: Lol. Sorry for the ex-part of it. Next time, we want to push to Orkney, too
 AntiSquid: never been to loch ness&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Don't be sorry, I'm not lolYeah, I'd like to get up there and the rest of the North coast too sometime
 KiwiTae: hey guys, is it possible to map input to arraylist in few characters in kotlin?
 AntiSquid: YannT
 MJS: Very nice Loch ness
 Astrobytes: Also MJS, Glencoe and the surrounding area is a great place to visit
 MJS: Visit the Picts fortresses
 YannT: KiwiTae: yeah
 MJS: We had a quick eye in Glencoe
 KiwiTae: YannT any tip? or just yea heheh
 MJS: lol
 MJS: http&#160;: // kotlin.org / manual&#160;;)
 YannT: val inputs = (0..7).map { input.nextInt() }
 YannT: for example
 IananasMian: hahaha
 KiwiTae: :joy::kissing_heart:thank you
 Astrobytes: If you like camping there's a great campsite called the Red Squirrel in Glencoe, I highly recommend it
 YannT: with 
 YannT: val input = java.util.Scanner(System.`in`)
 MJS: Erf. Camping, with three children, means "trailer park"
 YannT: you can also do stuff like this for parsing input strings:
 Astrobytes: Yeah they have a section for trailers and vans too, separate from the tents
 MJS: I could give it a try
 YannT: repeat(3) { _ -&gt; input.nextLine() }
 YannT: input.nextLine().forEach{ c -&gt; ... } do do stuff with each char of an input string (like for readiing a liine of the map typically)
 eulerscheZahl: input() for i in range(3)
 eulerscheZahl: ... for x in input().split()
 eulerscheZahl: ignore the split() if you want to go by chars
 YannT: I like functiionnal better but it's really a matter of taste&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: just providing some python alternatives
 dbdr: that's functional too
 YannT: I'd say for loops are more iterative typically
 MJS: [Jedi voice] You don't need an array list...
 dbdr: it's not a for loop
 dbdr: for ( ... x++ ) is imperative indeed
 dbdr: for x in iterable is just a different syntax for a foreach
 YannT: don't know python so II'm sure you're right&#160;:)
 dbdr: don't know much either&#160;:)
 dbdr: you can argue foreach is imperative too
 dbdr: it has side effects
 dbdr: you just don't manipulate the index
 MJS: expr(i) for i in collection is the 'map' syntax in Python. The collection is unchanged
 YannT: depends, not in kotlin it will yell at you if you try to mutate the iterable from within the foreach
 dbdr: what you put inside the foreach in kotlin will have side effects
 dbdr: otherwise it's useless
 YannT: oh, in that sense then yes&#160;:)
 dbdr: but it's higher level indeed, which is a good idea
 dbdr: anyways, it's hard to read the input without side effects&#160;;)
 KiwiTae: im newbi to kotlin ~
 YannT: it's basically better Java, stick with it it's a joy to use&#160;:)
 dbdr: YannT is our Kotlin guru&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: awesom
 MJS: lol. I thought that Scala was better Java? (&lt;/troll&gt;)
 eulerscheZahl: i used the intelliJ java-&gt;kotlin converter when i participated in a kotlin-only coding contest to promote the language :flushed:
 KiwiTae: haha
 KiwiTae: shame
 YannT: never used Scala, but my understanding is it's really a different focus
 YannT: Kotlin was made by devs, for devs, so there's plenty of syntaxic sugar and convenience features
 MJS: Scala is powerful because of many ways to call code implicitly. It means that team mates will not be able to read your code...
 MJS: Plus, Scala lacks tail call optimization
 eulerscheZahl: and VBA was made by microsoft for inexperienced users
 eulerscheZahl: a horrible language
 MJS: I would favor Kotlin over Scala
 YannT: the best way to explain the point of kotlin is:
 YannT: data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
 YannT: I just defined a class with getters, equals, hashCode, copy
 YannT: data class Person(var name: String, var age: Int)
 YannT: now my class is mutable and has setters
 MJS: Scala has the same&#160;;)
 YannT: you'll never go back to Java after you get used to stuff like this :D
 MJS: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/monadster/">https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/monadster/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the get-set thing about java is annoying, agreed
 eulerscheZahl: c# has simple getters/setters at least
 MJS: It is in F#, but it is the link I use to bring people into functional programming
 aCat: I want to never back to java after coding in anything different ;p
 YannT: kotlin is full of small convenient things like
 MJS: I converted a whole Java team to functional programming in Java. Got bullets from the so-called experts&#160;:)
 YannT: fun Int.valid() = x(this) in 0..(SIZE - 1) &amp;&amp; ...
 MJS: Does it add Valid to all ints&#160;?
 YannT: no return for methods with a single expression, replace by = instead of a block
 YannT: *and* it defined that method on the int yeah
 YannT: so you can do like 
 YannT: 10.valid()
 MJS: Great, indeed. Safer than full generics, and neat syntax. I love it
 YannT: ( x(this) is part of my OOC code ahah)
 YannT: 0..6 also is a way to say between those
 MJS: I'll paste it in my F# code and see if I go to Gold&#160;;)
 YannT: instead of writiing two conditions
 YannT: my OOC for testing if a position (x and y but as an int) is:
 YannT: private fun Int.valid() =
 YannT: and then I can run the validity check on any int (makes sense only if it's a position Int I guess, but hey)
 dbdr: actually being able to define new types implemented by a primitive type is quite nice to detect bugs
 dbdr: not all ints mean positions...
 YannT: I mean there's no performance of whatever upside to thiis other over just writing the entire test proper, but it's just convenient and nice and why I like this language&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: \o/ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30122730?tab=submissions">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30122730?tab=submissions</a>
 YannT: well yeah you'd probably like to do:
 YannT: typealias Position = Int
 dbdr: does that make Position incompatible with int?
 MJS: I actually creates a list of water Points and use them almost like an enum
 YannT: no, but it makes Int incompatible with Position
 dbdr: e.g. Position / int does not make sense
 YannT: I'd have to try tbh but I think Position / int would work
 dbdr: ah, so Position / int gives you an int?
 dbdr: but not a position
 YannT: but say a method expects a Position and you give it an int, it won't work
 dbdr: right
 YannT: I think it considers it a kind of subclass basically
 YannT: Positiion extends Int
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: that'll catch most of the bugs
 YannT: another big thing in kotlin that's also REALLY nice is nullability checks built in
 YannT: Int is not nullable, Int? is nullable, and it's two different types
 YannT: (plus iin that particular case, it'll use a primitive for non_nullable int, and Integer for the nullable one)
 YannT: somenullable?.map { ... } will only do anything if somenullable is not null (and if you don't put the questiion mark it won't compile saying you hjave a nullability issue to handle)
 MJS: That's valuable, indeed
 MJS: NullPointerException is the object I have instanciated most often in Java (or is it String?)
 MJS: (class, not object...)
 dbdr: the billion dollar mistake
 MJS: lol
 MJS: Still cheaper than Trump, but worth using Kotlin
 Nerchio: Kotlin sounds decent :p
 AntiSquid:  /ban
 AntiSquid: &gt;:(
 MJS: lol
 DivadCurca: chop chop
 Nerchio: muda muda muda muda

 dbdr: nice Quidome!
 Astrobytes: hardcoded lol
 dbdr: looking forward to a second rusty bot in top league&#160;:)
 dbdr: yes? I guess you can definitely go some way with simple patterns
 Astrobytes: For sure!
 Quidome: Only some defences to build in
 Quidome: I think to make it to wood 1
 Quidome: puzzling on how to do that
 dbdr: 196k gold is sure nice :D
 Quidome: :punch:
 Astrobytes: You got the idea from Illeda n's boss-testing bot right? :D
 dbdr: Quidome are you minimizing the amount of rocks in your target area?
 Quidome: Yeah, didn't want to go there, gave it a second thought
 Quidome: Indeed i do
 Quidome: minimize the amount of rocks
 Quidome: and only considering the centre part for the star pattern
 Quidome: Just fooling around. This will NOT get me into a high position

 dbdr: a Three Letter Acronym
 MSmits: o
 Astrobytes: GNU
 Astrobytes: Best of both worlds
 dbdr: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: wineXNA
 Astrobytes: Donno what XNA actually stands for
 Astrobytes: Xtremely Noobish Architecture?
 dbdr: what about TLTs, the Three Letter TLAs?
 dbdr: all TLAs are TLTs
 jacek: MLP!
 eulerscheZahl: the microsoft  XNA gamestudioXNA = XNA is not an acronym or something like that
 Astrobytes: nice dbdr&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: and all TLTs are TLAs
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know what XNA is, just wondered if it was an acronym
 dbdr: so TLT == TLA
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: divide by TL
 dbdr: T == A
 Astrobytes: Some proof
 JBM: kamoulox
 JBM: wait, that doesn't translate well
 eulerscheZahl: Microsoft XNA (a recursive acronym for XNA's not acronymed) ...

 icecream17: ugh. my get angle function isn't wortking. Got 959 degrees...

 icecream17: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: some radians problem?
 icecream17: I can't tell. If I don't multiply somehow the angle becomes -357...
 struct: How does your function looks like?
 icecream17: dx = (nextCP.x - pod.x) / dist
 icecream17: a = Math.acos(dx) // * 180.0 * Math.PI
 icecream17: (dy is dx but with .y instead)

 icecream17: no. but used the one liner trick to get to gold. but now the inputs are all different... luckily my code was just some ifs.
 Astrobytes: The downside of -3 vel
 icecream17: My silver submit crashes on first turn. But is somehow 3,447th. So I think my submit is good for now

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/MultiStruct/Yinsh">https://github.com/MultiStruct/Yinsh</a>
 eulerscheZahl: someone committed the .idea folder
 Astrobytes: lol, proof.txt &gt; "I'm Tobou"
 struct: That one is outdated
 eulerscheZahl: i asked him to prove his identity :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 eulerscheZahl: struct deleted, tobou claiming it's him
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I wasn't around at the time
 Astrobytes: Did you delete Nulte or whatever it's called too struct?
 struct: I dont even remember the names
 Astrobytes: Crisis of identity :P
 Zenoscave: Tobou you gonna delete your profile too?
 jacek: why the Y game has no creator?
 Zenoscave: You mean Yavalath?
 Astrobytes: Tobou is struc t, struc t made Yavalath, struc t deleted after UTG fail, reactivated Tobou, changed nick to struc t.
 MSmits: mmh I am starting to doubt this "PASS" move ever happens eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: gonna do a CG bench test where my bot breaks out of the game if it happens during a sim, that should be billions of simulation steps
 eulerscheZahl: i can live without it
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/624d596d-acb8-4814-a8ab-011f125985ac">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/624d596d-acb8-4814-a8ab-011f125985ac</a>
 jacek: yes, i have segfaults when i try mcts
 jacek: though like 1 in 1000 games
 jacek: because i dont take the pass possibility into account at all
 MSmits: hmm so it does happen?
 MSmits: or maybe you have a different type of segfault
 eulerscheZahl: rare in the sim with a certain depth means almost impossible in actual gameplay
 jacek: nah, in simulation step i try to&#160;% n, where n is 0, where n is number of possible moves
 MSmits: hm ok
 jacek: this happen very very rarely indeed
 MSmits: jacek can you even setup  a board where this happens?
 MSmits: I doubt it is possible
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: you would have to have two cards that only have moves in 1 x direction and in 1 y direction
 MSmits: because one assumes the only way to do this is to have just a master and just have it in the corner
 MSmits: if that doesnt block movement, then nothing will
 eulerscheZahl: or own units blocking the movements
 MSmits: those units can then move
 MSmits: so that actually makes it easier
 eulerscheZahl: wait for the counterexample to prove you wrong
 MSmits: i am trying to guide you guys into providing me one&#160;:)
 MSmits: so far 12 games, no timeout
 Astrobytes: Very subtle.
 MSmits: i check every node expansion
 MSmits: so thats many millions already
 jacek: still not enough apparently
 MSmits: restarted it at 20 games. I want it to print the board when it happens, so I immediately have an example
 jacek: such dedication
 MSmits: well if i can discount the possibility, I simplify my code
 jacek: 900 games so far, not example encountered
 MSmits: well if you get a segfault, how would you know it is due to this issue? Do you print the board when it happens?
 eulerscheZahl: then we are coming closer to the 1000th match you mentioned
 eulerscheZahl: i know that that's not how statistics work :P
 jacek: yes, i hope to print the board before the segfault happens
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: are you doing this brutaltester-style?
 MSmits: locally?
 jacek: brutaltester?
 jacek: im doint it with my own code
 MSmits: i meant are you relying on the server to process it
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/91eb8c87-36c3-4526-adcd-035205412d97">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/91eb8c87-36c3-4526-adcd-035205412d97</a>
 MSmits: for black?
 jacek: the ids of one's cards, two's cards, current player and board
 Nerchio:  
 Nerchio: i advanced like 100 000 places after ooc xdd
 MSmits: so card 15 and 17
 MSmits: 15 and 7
 jacek: and bB is second player
 MSmits: hmm right, 7 is a card that can do that
 MSmits: lemme check 15
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: good example
 MSmits: problem solved 
 jacek: it took 1299 of self-play games, 50ms each side
 MSmits: it's possible it never occurs for me, if my eval discourages it
 MSmits: it's funny how this happens when the opponent is all lined up on the side. 
 MSmits: I guess it can't happen on the start
 jacek: this is what you get for near fully random games
 MSmits: there are no cards that only go left and right are there?
 MSmits: or left/right
 MSmits: back
 eulerscheZahl: mystery solved. and there are a lot of units blocking each other
 MSmits: yeah I discounted this possibility because I imagined the starting line, if it was a possibility, then it would crash on start
 MSmits: but the cards are different for y and x
 MSmits: probably allow more y movement forward
 MSmits: but we still don't know if your referee code works eulerscheZahl :P
 jacek: lets crash him
 eulerscheZahl: in theory the referee can handle it
 eulerscheZahl: but i never tested it
 eulerscheZahl: so it will most likely crash
 jacek: blame the approvers
 dp_legend: hi
 eulerscheZahl: of course, whom else should i blame? me? that's ridiculous
 dbdr: it's like the Glykolwein-Skandal
 eulerscheZahl: don't make me google for weird things when i want to go to bed
 dbdr: the wine makers who put a deadly chemical in their wine. when found out, they blamed the consumers who bought it without being more careful

 dbdr: a great channel for interesting weird stories
 dbdr: 34 minutes, just the right length before bed time for you&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: no, wikipedia must do the job here
 dbdr: but the story-telling...&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: then i'll save it for tomorrow
 Quidome: dbdr what IDE are you using with rust?
 dbdr: nvim
 dbdr: you?
 Quidome: hm, never heard of that one
 Quidome: Intellij
 Quidome: dou you have a debugger?
 dbdr: neovim
 Quidome: works well?
 Quidome: I am working without ....
 Astrobytes: Didn't know about that one dbdr, Germans mixing their wines with the [poisonous] Austrian ones eh, scandalous indeed
 dbdr: it's not really an IDE, it's a text editor, you can configure it in complicated and powerful ways
 dbdr: I almost never used or needed a debugger, but I should investigate that when I do
 dbdr: IntelliJ is surely easiere to get started with
 dbdr: I think VS Code is the most popular editor for Rust, vi second
 Quidome: yes, i am used to that, but would like to have a debugger, was looking for some experience&#160;:)
 dbdr: IntelliJ 3rd close after vim
 dbdr: no debugger in IntelliJ?
 Quidome: CLion has it, but that is paid only
 Astrobytes: Rust has no official debugger?
 MSmits: Rust has no bugs
 dbdr: ^
 dbdr: :D
 Quidome: Don't want to go configuring difficult things but I think i have to&#160;:(
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb</a>
 dbdr: try VSCode maybe?
 Quidome: Well indeed that's what i like about Rust, less bugs 
 Quidome: After you got it compiled, amd that can be very hard sometimes
 dbdr: if I have an issue, I try to come up with a unit test that demonstrates it
 dbdr: good thing is you can keep the test afterwards&#160;:)
 Quidome: Nice way of working of course
 MSmits: I don't really use advanced features of visual studio when I code
 dbdr: and testing is supported out of the box, no need to extra tooling
 Quidome: Have to look into that as well
 MSmits: usually my debugging is print functions and cerr statements
 Quidome: oh, great
 Quidome: yes that's what i do at the moment
 Quidome: but sometimes it's nice to have a debugger
 dbdr: #[test]fn test_that_xxx() {
 MSmits: never used assert before
 Quidome: How does it run
 dbdr: cargo test
 dbdr: will run all the tests
 Astrobytes: clean
 dbdr: cargo test foo
 Quidome: aha, at the moment i never use cargo directly
 dbdr: runs all the tests whose name contain foo
 Quidome: sounds good
 dbdr: you call rustc by hand?
 Astrobytes: Very straightforward
 Quidome: no through intellij
 dbdr: cargo is super useful as soon as you have any dependency
 dbdr: ah ok
 Quidome: well, 2 weeks into Rust and i am impressed
 dbdr: surely there's a way to call tests from IntelliJ too
 Quidome: Still a lot to learn though
 dbdr: if you don't get scared in the beginning and start to like it, it will only get better
 Quidome: Got this borrowing/moving stuff sorted out, sort of
 Quidome: Totally confused by lifetimes BTW
 Astrobytes: My friend keeps urging me to get into it but... I keep putting it off
 dbdr: you can go very far without needing lifetimes
 dbdr: don't store references, that's all&#160;:)
 Quidome: Yes, but still, want to understand it, but not today&#160;:)
 dbdr: I just watched a video about it
 Quidome: If you have a graph with self referntial nodes you have that problem right?
 dbdr: yes
 Quidome: haven't found a good place to learn about it
 dbdr: ask MSmits&#160;:)
 Quidome: really
 Quidome: is he into Rust
 Quidome:&#160;??
 dbdr: even in C++ where you can use references willy-nilly, what they end up using for storing the MCTS tree
 dbdr: is one huge array with indices as "pointers"
 dbdr: that's the most efficient
 Quidome: Question, did you di bender 4?
 dbdr: is that the optim one?
 struct: nodes = new Node[MAX_NODES];
 Quidome: yes
 struct: Its euler one
 dbdr: well yes
 Quidome: I know and nice
 Quidome: I am at 83% and having performance issue
 MSmits: ack... does Rust force you to initialize all variables before use?
 Quidome: Asking myself what do i do wrong with Rust?
 MSmits: can I have 30 million nodes in an object pool at turn 1 with Rust?
 dbdr: probably it's the algorithm, Quidome
 Quidome: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 dbdr: MSmits: you need to tell the compiler you know what you are doing, since it can be unsafe, but yes you can do it&#160;:)
 MSmits: ah ok good&#160;:)
 Quidome: I have roughly 100.000 states stored in a hashmap and need twice as much 
 dbdr: that's the general design of the language: good safe practices should be easy
 dbdr: anything should be possible, but if it's dangerous it will be verbose to make sure you really want it
 dbdr: e.g. immutable by default, say mut if you really need it
 Nerchio: i was using all public fields in ooc to cut down on number of characters 
 Nerchio: good practices
 Nerchio: xD
 Quidome: Should I use the hashmap is my first question?
 Quidome: or is there a different approach?
 dbdr: it's been some time, but yes I think I hash to detect identical states
 Quidome: Ok, good plain vanilla BFS
 Quidome:&#160;??
 MSmits: you dont need hashmap for BFS
 MSmits: hashset will be better
 Quidome: In this case you do
 MSmits: but if it is a small map, you're better off with a bitboard
 Quidome: The map can change
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: that's complicated
 MSmits: which game is this?
 Quidome: bender 4
 MSmits: ahh yeah
 Quidome: it's fun&#160;:)
 MSmits: no doubt
 MSmits: euler made it
 Quidome: really nice to see your agent walking the right way pushing the right buttons
 Astrobytes: ARe Rust lifetimes something to do with reference counting?
 Quidome: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 dbdr: Quidome: I think I don't store the full state in the hashmap, only a hash of it&#160;:)
 dbdr: indeed memory can be an issue
 Quidome: Yes, and there i wanted to use the reference in a struct
 dbdr: the other thing is, you don't have to solve the levels online
 Quidome: didn't get it working&#160;:(
 Quidome: The after submit levels are also available?
 dbdr: yes
 Quidome: great&#160;:)
 dbdr: that does not change a lot, but it means you don't need to care if it takes 1s or 10s
 dbdr: should be in the github
 Quidome: yes, i got all the testlevels already and not at 100%, so that was my firs aim.
 Quidome: But good to know, thnxs
 dbdr: Astrobytes: not ref counting. a lifetime is how long a reference lives. e.g. static data lives forever, data on the stack only leaves until the end of the function
 dbdr: essentially this is what allows Rust to be a memory safe language without need a garbage collector
 Quidome: unless you move it out to another function that is
 dbdr: yes
 Quidome: and that's the strange part
 Quidome: but also cool
 dbdr: you can also use refcounting if you really want to, for specific data
 Astrobytes: Alright I get that. Stops you doing random bugs too a la C++ references
 dbdr: exactly. no segfault, and no GC. that's pretty sweet in my book
 Quidome: yes, once you got it compiled you are almost there most of the time
 dbdr: yes :D
 Quidome: I really like that a lot
 Quidome: But get it compiled can be a pain in the ass
 Astrobytes: It's an interesting language. I really should get my finger out my ass and get into it.
 dbdr: did you follow the rust book?
 Astrobytes: I imagine it teaches you a lot Quidome
 Quidome: Yes it does
 Astrobytes: The Rust Book is still the way to go right?
 dbdr: the thing is, because it's such a different concept. it's not ideal to just pick up basic syntax and try to code as you did in the past
 dbdr: you will end up designing in ways that seems very complicated
 Quidome: I read parts of the book, as i said just 2 weeks into it now. Have to start over again with my current knowledge
 dbdr: while there is a simpler way
 Astrobytes: That's why I've been learning about it first
 Astrobytes: Diving right in didn't work :D
 Quidome: Build a TaD bot with it :D
 Quidome: 2nd place in wood 2
 Astrobytes: I'll stick with C++ for that for now lol
 dbdr: you pushed Illedan down, nice :D
 Quidome: Yes and i pushed the BOss way up
 Astrobytes: But yeah, I use CG for learning /practicing any new language
 Quidome: I am a little bit stuck at this level, need a new approach
 Astrobytes: I was gonna say Quidome, stop pushing the f'ing boss so much :D
 Astrobytes: You know it does a 2 or 3 ply minimax?
 Quidome: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Quidome: yeah, need a very good eval for that
 Astrobytes: Or 1-2 ply, can't remember
 dbdr: I don't think the boss is that strong (3 ply)
 Quidome: i think 2-3 is doable with move sorting
 Astrobytes: I think it's 1 or 2, ask Illedan, it's all his fault
 dbdr: move sorting to increase the cuts?
 Quidome: yep
 Quidome: still you need a good eval and can't settle on what to do
 dbdr: I haven't used any more eval than gold[0] - gold[1]&#160;:)
 dbdr: but probably will eventually
 Quidome: Oh, really and your at place 3 with that?
 Quidome: Amazing...
 dbdr: I'm still experimenting at this point
 dbdr: I think only top 2 have decent bots
 Astrobytes: You minimax dbdr?
 aCat: hmm, what game?
 dbdr: game is pretty young
 dbdr: yes
 Quidome: 2-ply with only gold eval, that's easy
 aCat: pegs?
 Astrobytes: I was thinking of some kind of MCTS for fun
 Quidome: Tulips and Daisies
 aCat: ouh, I idn't read the rules even
 dbdr: EricSMSO said he had trouble with MCTS
 Quidome: OK, the top 2 does minimax with more eval then?
 Astrobytes: oh really? What was the issue?
 dbdr: he would know better
 Astrobytes: If tric trac is at the top Quidome then you know there's some kind of minimax variant that can be done&#160;:)
 dbdr: trictrac only had a heuristic yesterday, but maybe he has a minimax now
 Quidome: Is it his speciality?
 Astrobytes: Only a heuristic?! Damn, god help us all when he gets his alphabeta out
 Astrobytes: Yeah Quidome, he's really damn good with it
 Quidome: with a good heuristic he will also manage to have a good eval
 Astrobytes: ^
 dbdr: as I said, maybe he has now
 dbdr: he was below EricSMSO yesterday
 Quidome: He is firmly in first position at the moment
 Astrobytes: That's what makes me suspect he has it now. Could be wrong
 jacek: well tric trac is always present at classic board games
 Astrobytes: He really is a master of the minimax
 Quidome: good to know&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: With a name like tric trac you'd expect he'd be good at the board games eh
 Quidome: I think i am gonna redo my bot that way
 Quidome: just fooling around at the moment to understand the game
 Astrobytes: Same. Plus I'm on painkillers for my back so not committing to any final code until I've reviewed it properly :P
 Quidome: Does it hurt?
 Quidome: sounds bad...
 Astrobytes: Reviewing my code or my back?
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Both actually!
 Quidome: :grin:
 Astrobytes: Slipped a disc (herniated disc), bad lower back pain
 Quidome: hm, not good
 Quidome: Is tritrac on the chat&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No, it's pretty crap. But hey, could be worse
 Astrobytes: Not right now, but when he's online he responds to pings
 Quidome: How do you ping?
 Astrobytes: Just by typing the username
 Quidome: like this Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yep! That's why we try not to ping people accidentally by separating letters, e.g, tric trac or Astrobyte s
 Quidome:&#160;:)
 MSmits: or Asstrobytes
 Quidome: :joy:
 Astrobytes: Shuddup Aladdin
 MSmits: :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: speeechleessss
 Quidome: ok, i quit, tommorow another day
 Quidome: see you guys
 MSmits: sure
 Astrobytes: Later Quidome
 EricSMSO: Hey dbdr, my MCTS search was very weak. But I think it MY implementation that is bad.
 Astrobytes: How so EricSMSO?
 EricSMSO: Too slow, rollout limited to depth 8, but not enough samples to give something valuable
 Astrobytes: Oh OK, so still worth exploring then
 EricSMSO: Also avaluated all possible moves, but now in minmax, I try less moves
 Astrobytes: Heavy rollouts better perhaps?
 dbdr: ah, you are pruning now EricSMSO? or you just mean the cuts?
 EricSMSO: Sorry I don't get what "heavy rollouts" are
 dbdr: light rollout is pure random
 Astrobytes: Rollouts with domain-specific knowledge, so guided by heuristics
 dbdr: heavy would be favoring better moves, or avoiding bad ones
 EricSMSO: @dbdr yes 1 I cut now, yes 2 heuristic rollout should do bettre
 dbdr: for me cut means what alpha beta does, just gain speed without changing result. pruning means heuristic to not consider every possible moves, might miss a good one in theory
 dbdr: just to clarify the terms
 AntiSquid: everyone at 0% for 11-puzzle? wtf?
 AntiSquid: was about to ask for advice nvm then
 ZarthaxX: just copypaste the solution
 AntiSquid: lol
 struct: :rofl:
 AntiSquid: you still at 0% ZarthaxX
 struct: Still doesnt know how to c&amp;p
 AntiSquid: trying to figure shit out though
 dbdr: I see plenty of ppl at 100%
 Astrobytes: Pretty sure lots of people solved that, lb bug?
 struct: me too
 AntiSquid: something to do with finding correct cycles
 dbdr: well, 7 ppl
 Astrobytes: Only 7?
 struct: This puzzle?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/11-puzzle/solution">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/11-puzzle/solution</a>
 dbdr: from the ppl I follow
 AntiSquid: yes
 dbdr: there is no leaderboard for puzzles is there?
 AntiSquid: no
 Astrobytes: Ah ok yeah, thought it was an optim, hence the lb
 AntiSquid: ah wait, if you click solutions it shows who solved it
 Astrobytes: my bad
 EricSMSO: dbdr how is it I can't play agains you in Tulips&#160;? Is it because of Rust&#160;?
 struct: not who solved it
 Astrobytes: Yes
 struct: but who shared the solution
 AntiSquid: ok that
 AntiSquid: w/e
 dbdr: EricSMSO timeout?
 EricSMSO: yes
 Astrobytes: It's the debug vs release mode thing
 dbdr: yes. I could send a compiled version, especially in a multi
 AntiSquid: problem is i can solve it, but the max move count is 50
 dbdr: my bot is still weak anyways, so don't worry about me yet&#160;;)
 struct: There are some resources online explaining it anti
 AntiSquid: time to train online on sliding puzzles i guess
 AntiSquid: ya i've read some stuff, but you need to minimize turn count Q_Q
 Astrobytes: A*?
 YannT: I'm not sure what A* actually has got to do wiith that one...
 Astrobytes: I've not done the puzzle, or looked at it (to be clear)
 Astrobytes: Just seen some sliding puzzles done with A* before :D
 YannT: I just looked at it and the hints say A*/Pathfinding
 struct: I think its used to calculate distance to target
 dbdr: just formulate the problem as a graph search
 YannT: is that that always what you do anywa :p
 YannT: iisn't*
 AntiSquid: i have it in cycles, so i rotate a bunch of numbers and i know it results in "that many" moves
 MSmits: when you solve this puzzle, make sure you hash visited states, then you should be fine
 MSmits: also do it bfs style with a queue, not dfs... that could send you down a very deep hole
 YannT: I can see the solution in my head (basically yeah, a graph search), just don't see how pathfinding factors into it
 MSmits: well bfs could be considered pathfinding
 MSmits: path in a graph
 Astrobytes: Well, I think there are multiple solutions
 dbdr: you know where you are, you know where you want to get
 dbdr: find the path between the two
 MSmits: you could indeed use A* with a heuristic that computes the difference between origin and goal state
 YannT: hmm, and you consider distance to objective as what, the number of misplaced tiles?
 AntiSquid: well it can if you do a row / column on the edge at a time to decrease the search space gradually ... basically you rotate a bunch of numbers in an area which means one of them gets to move somewhere
 MSmits: you could even do the manhattan distance for the misplaced tiles
 MSmits: not just the misplaced count
 YannT: and since you'll need to "go back" to position some other tiles, you'd need A*
 YannT: I guess I get it
 AntiSquid: but my approach of one row / column at a time takes too many turns @_@
 YannT: actually wait no
 MSmits: A* can guarantee the shortest path, but only if you use a suitable heuristic
 YannT: A* ouwldn't let you displace a properly placed tiles to make way for another in that case
 MSmits: sure it would
 YannT: not if you distance is correctness of puzzle
 AntiSquid: if you A*, you A* for each individual number or what
 MSmits: A*  prefers moves that have a short distance, it does not disallow other moves
 MSmits: otherwise you could not take a winding path in a maze either
 YannT: I guess you're right
 Astrobytes: is Manhattan fast enough for this one MSmits? Should be right?
 YannT: I'm gonna try it it's interesting
 Astrobytes: for h I mean
 MSmits: well Astrobytes it's a loop over 12 numbers and for each you do the manhattan, takes some calculation, but complexity with other algorithms might be exponential so...
 Astrobytes: Well I mean vs the hamming distance
 MSmits: what was hamming again?
 Astrobytes: The misplaced tiles
 Astrobytes: in this case
 MSmits: how is it different here, hamming and manhattan?
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: you count the number of tiles that are correct
 MSmits: nah, that's not a good heuristic
 MSmits: what if they are all incorrect
 Astrobytes: Hamming is how many tiles are in the wrong place, manhattan is the distance/moves required
 MSmits: how would they be guided to the right position?
 Astrobytes: yes
 Astrobytes: I just rubberducked that
 <b>**MSmits is happy to be :duck:</b>
 Astrobytes: Might do this puzzle tomorrow, been a while since I did any
 icecream17: EricSMSO! Your game has crashed!!!!
 MSmits: oh noes!
 icecream17: The game has crashed. Please contact the author and enclose the following error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95d0ec74-598d-4148-bdf6-cd093c1fa94b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/95d0ec74-598d-4148-bdf6-cd093c1fa94b</a>

 struct: 300 ms per turn
 struct: damn
 EricSMSO: I see. I allowed 300 ms per turn because I found it was necessary to have much time every turn. Usually games are very short but it seems it is not the case this time. This may happen when the two players are playing random and nobody wins. is this the case this time&#160;? I cannot see anything in the replay, the screen is empty
 struct: I think you should leave it as it is
 icecream17: Final board configuartion: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/wadJ5GF">https://imgur.com/a/wadJ5GF</a>
 struct: a NN was needed to break the game
 Astrobytes: screen empty on replay for me too
 icecream17: my weights were all 0.5....
 EricSMSO: Wow, it is really random. I prefer to prvilege thinking over random :sweat_smile:
 icecream17: IDE code v arena code, its different
 icecream17: I think my NN is much worse than the arena code....
 EricSMSO: I would have loved to be able to give a global time amount to each player. Unfortunately this is not feasible at the present time, so I had to choose a time per turn
 struct: I think that feature should be added tbh
 Astrobytes: Add it to the wishlist
 EricSMSO: +1
 Astrobytes:&#160;:+1:
 Nerchio: does anyone know if you can do something like this in lambda
 Nerchio: im talking about java but maybe in other languages is similar
 Nerchio: a -&gt; a.production / fact.paths.get(a)
 Nerchio: where fact is an object outside of lambda with a list of paths
 Nerchio: it says null pointer exception but its not null not sure if you can do it
 Astrobytes: I'm not a Java person but you may need to have fact as a parameter?
 Astrobytes: So [guessing] like (a, fact) -&gt; blahblah
 Nerchio: hm you need interface for this in java
 Nerchio: kind sucks
 Nerchio: destroys the point of the lambda :D
 MadKnight: Nerchio
 MadKnight: if it says null pointer exception then your variable is null 
 Nerchio: its not i am testing it outside
 Nerchio: of the lambda
 Nerchio: but maybe lambda is angry that it could be null
 Nerchio: and doesn't like it
 MadKnight: does it compile&#160;?
 Nerchio: no
 MadKnight: so it's a compile error&#160;?
 Nerchio: yeah
 MadKnight: then show us the error
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41be972f-e93d-446d-b51a-17f0f21cb420">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/41be972f-e93d-446d-b51a-17f0f21cb420</a>
 MadKnight: this is a runtime error
 MadKnight: it means your code compiled 
 Nerchio: ok :D
 struct: MadKnight the java god
 Nerchio: you're right
 MadKnight: it's actually C# stuff
 Nerchio: but that doesnt fix my problem :D
 Astrobytes: JavaKnight
 MadKnight: that does Nerchio
 MadKnight: it means your lambda has access to this variable but this variable itself is null
 MadKnight: u need to fix your variable Nerchio
 Nerchio: oh i think i know what might be the problem then
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: thanks
 Nerchio:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Weirdo languages :P
 Nerchio: so my list of distances from node to node doesn't have itself as a node
 Nerchio: so if you try to find path to itself its null
 Nerchio: i removed this possibility now and it doesnt error&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: That would definitely do it
 Astrobytes: MadSaviour
 MadKnight: Astrodidn'thelp
 Astrobytes: Hey MadKnight what you doing these days, don't see you much
 Astrobytes: Astro'tried-but-gave-a-caveat
 MadKnight: u couldn't tell that null reference exception means null reference runtime crash&#160;?
 Nerchio: hm i really just started programming for ocean of code so :p
 Astrobytes: NullPointerException
 Astrobytes: Anyway, my painkillers are clouding my brain, I don't trust any code I write now.
 Astrobytes: Time for a movie
 Astrobytes: gn all

 Nerchio: you are writing the bot as well or just submitting to make my life miserable
 Nerchio: xD
 Zenoscave: I submitted a few days ago
 Zenoscave: And a few seconds ago

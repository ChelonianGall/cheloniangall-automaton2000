 RealJasomo: y'all should press share code more
 fachryadhitya: hi
 jacek: aww
 fatboysticks: Hi, can someone tell me why it's important to have the mountain height if you just need the index? 
 Uljahn: to compare and select the highest?
 pedrosorio: best time ever
 Dlx: and why can't I get to finish my code when the clash is over, come on... I bet 95% of people here care most about solving it, not really winning it... so unsatisfying that i copied my code and finished it in a  jupyter notebook lol
 pedrosorio: that's pretty lame, they should let you go back
 Dlx: yep..
 pedrosorio: and run the test cases
 Dlx: hello admin, fix it ;p
 Dlx: I just staret codingame, it's pretty fun :D just bitchin about some minor stuff...
 Dlx: isn't there a suggestion box here...
 pedrosorio: submitted to early
 Dlx: Also, best score/most tests passed should count, not randomly last test run or last code... and also, frigging warn 60 seconds left with red flashing&#160;:)
 Dlx: Dang I'm doing this coding style for my next pair programming... will be working so fast and dirty on first pass that buddy will have no chanse to follow what I'm doing, just for fun, and then refactor refactor refactor after ;p
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: fix it
 Automaton2000: what if you could do a better job
 Dlx: what, lol&#160;:)
 fachryadhitya: :worried:
 _Feri_: hi
 Balki: hi
 Balki: fatboysticks because 1 shot doesnt destroy the mountain entirely and you need to shoot the highest
 MSmits: morning
 MSmits: guys, I have an othello version that can take dbdr off nr 1 
 MSmits: it just wont be me up there, but tric trac :P
 dbdr: stats?
 MSmits: 25% win vs you, 11% vs tric trac
 dbdr: OK, what do you want MSmits?&#160;;)
 dbdr: oh
 MSmits: nothing, i am not submitting this :P
 MSmits: its just funny
 dbdr: I thought you were over 50% against me
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: but i can spam you down :P
 dbdr: but I would just need to resub, no?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: its often like that
 dbdr: check what trictrac offers you&#160;;)
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: i have no idea why btw, i just try to fit the params and these versions pop up
 dbdr: right
 MSmits: it also does 50% vs jacek which is ok, but does poorly vs Robo
 dbdr: probably hits a blind spot
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: an opening bool would probably help with that
 MSmits: win = true&#160;?
 dbdr:&#160;?
 MSmits: an opening bool
 dbdr: book :D
 MSmits: hehe
 MSmits: yeah that would probably help yes
 MSmits: how much space do you have left?
 MSmits: opening books dont require that much space if you're selective with what you put in
 dbdr: I could probably compress source more if needed
 MSmits: ahh ok
 dbdr: and yes, a targeted book would be small
 whay: i love axis
 MSmits: btw this does assume your error happens in the first 20 plies or so
 dbdr: given my lead, I'm happier to have a compiled version ppl can test against
 dbdr: indeed
 dbdr: I've also looked at binary compression
 whay: you
 dbdr: interesting rabbit hole
 MSmits: though it's not unlikely. My bot is not very good compared to yours so it should be making mistakes fairly soon
 whay: you have boot?
 MSmits: you probably wont even get near your mistake when you make a book, because you already exploit an earlier one of mine
 MSmits: yeah compression is interesting
 MSmits: I was looking at the EDAX eval and figuring out if i could compress that
 MSmits: but its just a tad bit too large I think
 dbdr: I was talking about compressing the executable
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: well you have to be able to decompress and run any other precalculation in 2 seconds right?
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: decompression is usually fast forCG-sizes, unless you go into NN type compression&#160;:)
 MSmits: whats different about that?
 dbdr: the (de)compressor is a NN
 MSmits: ohh ok
 dbdr: are you CG-vacationing?&#160;:)
 whay: listen
 whay: wait
 MSmits: pretty much, i do have 2 things I have to do for work, but most of the time will be CG
 whay: you can listen me
 MSmits: I was on vacation last week
 dbdr: I thought you were traveling
 dbdr: ah ok
 dbdr: that's why it took so long&#160;;)
 MSmits: my wife tells me not to advertise it online because of burglary
 MSmits: i was actually working on othello during my vacation :P
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: most importantly I made stuff into AVX
 whay: you have wife
 dbdr: it's true your real life collides with C because of your students, right?
 MSmits: with C?
 dbdr: CG
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: hmm rarely yes
 MSmits: might happen more often in the future
 dbdr: collisions with C are dangerous, because it does not have much safety features&#160;;)
 MSmits: that's true I guess
 MSmits: the students i get here are really not that type though
 MSmits: CG is more used as an extracurricular activity
 MSmits: since they're mostly not good enough to do stuff here
 MSmits: it's funny, I had one student here a week or two ago that wasn't even in my CS class, I taught him physics
 MSmits: he didn't pick CS because the previous curriculum seemed too easy for him
 jacek: im still at figuring out what patterns would be useful
 jacek: dbdr your 300k weights, those are NTuples?
 MSmits: jacek why not look at edax
 jacek: edax too complicated
 whay: hi
 MSmits: not really, there is 1 pattern you wont be able to fit
 whay: hi
 MSmits: you can fit 9-tuples, 10 is too much
 MSmits: also edax has different eval for every ply
 jacek: 3^9?
 MSmits: just dont do that
 whay: :angry:
 MSmits: yeah jacek
 MSmits: 3^9 bytes is doable
 jacek: that would require fancy compression
 MSmits: that's 10k characters
 MSmits: fits
 jacek: it has just one 3^9?
 MSmits: one or two, not too many
 jacek: is it 3x3 corner?
 MSmits: think it might be yes
 MSmits: eval.c is the file
 MSmits: you can find out yourself
 jacek: my preliminary results didnt show much gain
 whay: msmits telle me
 jacek: but perhaps i need to gib more training to it
 MSmits: maybe
 MSmits: how fast is your bot with that eval?
 MSmits: how many states does it eval?
 jacek: 30k evals per turn
 jacek: 145ms
 MSmits: ahh, so somewhere between Robo and mine
 MSmits: kind of a halfway NN
 jacek: 4 8x1 patterns, 16 lookups
 jacek: + mobiility and frontiers
 MSmits: Robo: 3k, you: 30k, me; 1 million
 jacek: work smarter not faster
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: mobility and frontiers I tought is supposed to be replaced by your eval?
 MSmits: thought
 MSmits: i think edax does just his ntuples
 jacek: it improved the strength
 jacek: perhaps those see game as global and patterns are more local
 MSmits: might be because the ntuples just arent trained enough, or the patterns not complicated enough
 MSmits: could be your approach is best for CG
 MSmits: limits
 jacek: the perks of machine learning. you dont know if there is bug in the code, or just training framework is bad, or you need to tweak the hyperparameters or change the model whatsoever
 MSmits: yeah that seems annoying
 jacek: and i recall tdgammon gained strength too when they added mroe advanced features to the raw board network
 MSmits: your argument about global vs local makes a lot of sense
 MSmits: mobility especially
 MSmits: because all it does is give you more choices
 MSmits: i dunno about frontiers though, havent been able to make it work very well.
 MSmits: i am refittign mobility now, will try frontiers after, it's at a low value
 jacek: it works for me, it always gives quite big negative weight
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: it's at -100 now for me. With mobility at +900
 MSmits: probably i just havent explored it enough
 MSmits: it's probably heavily correlated with mobility also
 MSmits: might need to fit them together
 jacek: its -0.057, while mobility is +0.11
 MSmits: ok so half the size
 MSmits: will try that later
 jacek: ymmv of course
 MSmits: all the versions I get lately are mostly strong against you and Renard, weak against the rest. Maybe telling me this helps you :P
 jacek: and yes, those 9 are 3x3 corners
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: the smaller ones may be of interest?
 MSmits: the release section also has a dat file with actual fitted values if you can decipher it
 jacek: could be, so far i dont have any diagonals
 MSmits: you might have to pick ply 20 or 30 or so 
 MSmits: because it is fitted by ply
 MSmits: they use 16 bit values
 MSmits: but the largest value is 2k something, so divide everything by 10.3 if i remember correctly
 MSmits: assuming you use bytes
 MSmits: I might have gone too far down this rabbit hole on my vacation :P
 jacek: i fell in NN rabbit hole and i cant get out
 YCS-Venom: me too&#160;:)
 DanielWebb: Hey, does anyone know where I would report an issue with a puzzle? (one where the expected output is actually wrong for the input)
 beyonik: why do my test cases keep expecting Nothing sometimes and other times they expect what I output
 MSmits: low expectations?
 MSmits: you obviously have a bug
 beyonik: what bug
 beyonik: how is it my fault
 MSmits: and it can be many things
 beyonik: that the test cases sometimes expect Nothing
 beyonik: and other times they expect something
 MSmits: i dont think they expected nothing, maybe your input/output is not synced?
 MSmits: as in, you provide output when you havent gotten new input yet
 MSmits: also, i dont know which puzzle or multi this is
 Astrobytes: Or an extra newline, missing newline, one answer when multiple are expected, the list goes on...
 MSmits: so its hard to comment
 MSmits: what Astrobytes said
 Astrobytes: But of course, it's the puzzle that has the bug. Clearly.
 MSmits: thats probably it, something like that
 beyonik: It surely wasn't newlines
 beyonik: also they only expected one answer
 beyonik: not multiple
 MSmits: link the puzzle
 beyonik: thing is I tried it for the first time, it didnt work, then I tried it again to see if I fixed my bug and it started just expecting "Nothing"
 Astrobytes: Yes, it does that when your output is incorrect.
 jacek: wooo another cat avatar
 zjzoloo: :joy:
 jacek: MSmits do you expand every children at once? as in, eval every children at once?
 MSmits: I do yes
 MSmits: That seems often better even when you do a full random rollout
 MSmits: so it makes sense that it would be better for a quick eval also
 jacek: so how do you count visits then
 MSmits: visits += childCount
 jacek: oh
 MSmits: well you get the point
 jacek: then in that case i have rather 300k games, not 30k
 MSmits: ahh ok, that makes more sense if your eval is fast
 MSmits: btw:

 daeun: i'm korean
 daeun: python is difficult
 tomatoes: its sometimes weird, but not difficult
 daeun: thank you. 
 jrke: can anyone make me explain movement of ant in langton's ant?
 itzblinkzy: share code please
 jacek: oO
 Illedan: jrke, I have no idea why you have such low time in SR&#160;:( But I heard others complained in other games too..
 jrke: yeah dunno why i can use only 37-38ms 
 jrke: there is bug in csb also maybe  i can use only 55-60ms in csb also&#160;:(
 Illedan: I guess something CG did, added some weird overhead on the bots :shrug:
 jacek: welcome scarfield
 jrke: np i will manage something 
 Crypticsy: hey is anyone here really really good in bash?
 Scarfield: :wave:
 jacek: is anyone ever good in bash?
 Crypticsy: XD 
 jrke: btw how much time you are using in SR illedian
 Scarfield: the level just increased by a lot
 Crypticsy: so one guy tried solving my Van Eck's sequence puzzle and pointed out that he couldn't pass the final test
 Crypticsy: i tried myself but couldn't either
 Crypticsy: would you give it a try and tell me if it is possible?
 Crypticsy: (in bash)
 Crypticsy: anyone?
 Illedan: jrke, what do you mean by time? Time to create it? Time to play it myself?
 jrke: i mean like im using 37-38ms.
 Illedan: Ah, I use 35 ms
 jrke: hmm
 Illedan: My code usually converges way faster anyway..
 jacek: java? maybe too long warmup or gc
 wlesavo: Crypticsy the last one requires optimized performance, last test works fine
 Crypticsy: so you solved it in bash?
 wlesavo: oh, sry, didnt notice bash
 Crypticsy: XD also i am the one who created it
 wlesavo: oh lol
 wlesavo: i need to learn reading at some point
 Crypticsy: yeah and i need to learn to explain bettter
 itfibonacci: start it man
 itzblinkzy: SHARE YOUR CODE!!
 ARatherLongUsername: prech itzblinkzy
 Logiman09: What dis?
 AbundantPuddle: Dis codingame.
 _Akira_: how do you friend request someone?
 pedrosorio: friends are just people you follow who also follow you afaik
 macobo: stalker^2
 dtinth: gets
 dtinth: oops, the chat pops up while I am in CoC
 dtinth: it moves the focus to the chat input, which is a bit unfortunate
 AbundantPuddle: Yes, that has happened to me as well.
 AbundantPuddle: I believe it is intentional to keep you on your toes.
 macobo: Thanks for sharing the code, dtinth :bow: Learned a lot&#160;:)
 whay: hi
 whay: i have chanel
 itzblinkzy: whay why you keep quitting clashes how will you learn
 itzblinkzy: give it a try at least
 whay: what do you mean
 whay: :star_and_crescent:
 whay: level up
 jacek: :tada:
 whay: thanx
 whay: :hugging:
 macobo: Woop, top 100 in CoC
 jacek: good for you
 Astrobytes: good submit for robo in Oware
 eulerscheZahl: top 2500 in CoC :trophy:
 dbdr: top NaN in CoC
 eulerscheZahl: you didn't play a single clash?
 dbdr: nope
 dbdr: should I?
 Astrobytes: Nah
 eulerscheZahl: not much interesting content you are missing out
 eulerscheZahl: except for the ascii value challenges
 dbdr: it'll be needed for the quest map though
 DomiKo: i wish there was no "shortest mode"
 eulerscheZahl: i an live with a not completed quest map on my profile page
 eulerscheZahl: an =&gt; can
 Astrobytes: hacker.org had a quest map of sorts iirc
 dbdr: it might block progress
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/uploads/default/original/3X/4/6/46676874ed9d718c72e12a6767621d5c77c649d7.jpeg">https://forum.codingame.com/uploads/default/original/3X/4/6/46676874ed9d718c72e12a6767621d5c77c649d7.jpeg</a>
 dbdr: not a Power User without CoC&#160;;)
 dbdr: (that was a prototype, of course)
 macobo: hacker.org was super fun, I guess it's dead though.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/3T4w7IG">https://imgur.com/a/3T4w7IG</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i miss hacker.org&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: countless hours of challenges
 dbdr: pretty
 eulerscheZahl: i learned a lot of stuff there. like sending web requests or image manipulation
 macobo: Spiral bits drives me mad still&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that one was quite easy for me, once i finally unlocked it :D
 eulerscheZahl: define start cell. then always flood fill to find the next bit. expand from the center of that region to find the nearest interesting color of another bit
 macobo: Doing that, the grainy image is providing headaches though&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/challenge/img/spiral3.png">http://www.hacker.org/challenge/img/spiral3.png</a>that was the crazy one :D
 macobo: I think I'm off by ~20 bits or smth and too lazy to struggle through :D 
 macobo: lol&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: after spiral bits there are some more fun ones. like a zip file with 4800 small images. you have to assemble them together to a large image
 eulerscheZahl: just to unlock a harder version with about 18k pieces
 eulerscheZahl: but these puzzles were always easier for me than the obscure crypto/stegano ones
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/challenge/img/the-maths.png">http://www.hacker.org/challenge/img/the-maths.png</a>this one was cool too, having an extra twist after you solve the first part of it
 oogabooga1: is there a tutorial/suggested reading/whatever to get started with the bots' programming games? I don't even know how to start!
 JBM: just avoid csb
 DomiKo: 1. pick the game2. do your best3. read forum
 oogabooga1: ty, is there some suggested challenges to tackle on first? or I just choose randomly hoping I don't get stuck,lol
 jacek: csb can be done with few ifs up to gold
 pedrosorio: what is csb?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 DomiKo: pick something you like
 DomiKo: that would be the best choice
 jacek: i.e. paper soccer :v
 Astrobytes: Naturally :smirk:
 pinarica: CSB is super fun!
 jacek: O:
 AbundantPuddle: Clever TNtube
 TNtube:&#160;?
 TNtube: Yes what&#160;?
 AbundantPuddle: Your answer on the clash. It was clever.
 TNtube: Thx 
 TNtube: What was the exercice&#160;? 
 TNtube: I forgoted it xD
 SirTarragon: Is there a way to grab the opponents distance to his checkpoint for csb?
 JakeCubes: how does and AND work?
 SirTarragon: &amp;&amp; works as if (x1 == x2 AND y1 == y2) then when both x1 == x2 and y1 == y2 are true, then what's inside the if statement will run.
 SirTarragon: Otherwise it won't.
 SirTarragon: if(x1==x2 &amp;&amp; y1 == y2)
 jrke: good mningor
 jrke: *morning
 SirTarragon: Ugh was just doing the Power of Thor Episode 1, was trying to figure out what was wrong. Just read that X, Y starts in the top left instead of bottom left so had to change some calculations around wooo
 SirTarragon: Mainly flip alot of my newYs from += to -= and the opposite
 jokzyz: yowhat is dn aioeverybody keeps talking about it
 el19oc: deez nuts
 jacek: hmm

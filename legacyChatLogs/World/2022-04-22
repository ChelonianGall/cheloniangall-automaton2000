 orangesnowfox: it works shockingly well
 orangesnowfox: Like, I'm surprised I don't have hard counters in the 500 ranks
 VizGhar: thats what shield is for&#160;;)
 VizGhar: be aggressive only with shield on
 orangesnowfox: shield doesn't counter controlling mobs :p
 orangesnowfox: aggro works tho... Still haven't bothered to fix that yet
 VizGhar: ah we are talking about mobs
 VizGhar: well i'm going to try search algo... wondering about performance. But I need to see algo working first. Then switch to C++
 orangesnowfox: ye, you *can* shield mobs, and it has been used to decent effect against me
 VizGhar: legend will be funny to watch
 orangesnowfox: namely <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621611492">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621611492</a> the hero just sits there the whole game shielding mobs into me
 rwilson: other than the language of the gods - anyone see any nice TALK in peoples bots yet?
 orangesnowfox: just some people using messages for describing what their bot is doing
 orangesnowfox: that's basically all I've seen
 JulienKerlero: how boring
 actualCoderTrevor: Mine say "Fus Ro Dah!!" and "Imperio!!"
 MeWhenI: i ran into someone who yelled "BEGONE" when casting a wind spell
 actualCoderTrevor: nice&#160;:)
 orangesnowfox: yeah, saw that one too
 MeWhenI: personally im sticking with Ancient Language
 rwilson: nice&#160;;), i like the begone &amp; the skyrim ref.
 rwilson: i was thinking about adding 'itsy bitsy spider' sining... just for giggles
 MeWhenI: but if anuone needs suggestions
 MeWhenI: rick roll lyrics
 rwilson: :p
 MeWhenI: or some cool moving ascii art
 rwilson: ooohhhh :nerd:
 actualCoderTrevor: Rick roll lyrics were legit already on my TODO
 MeWhenI: lol nice
 actualCoderTrevor: I remember for the Spring 2021 challenge I ended up getting distracted spending hours on messages
 actualCoderTrevor: It was fun
 MeWhenI: its too bad you don't get your opponent's messages as input
 MeWhenI: the conversation meta could be huge
 rwilson: That would cool - but also make 'fingerprinting' a little easier ( then harder as it turned into a meta game )
 Enknable: MeWhenI making bad moves just so you make worse ones lol
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh I did see someone's heros saying "Spin it to win it" when they attacked; I liked that.
 rwilson: :thumbsup: , i've always enjoyed the ones that did a little 'smack talk' or something ... 
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621611079">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621611079</a> another loss to the airbender strat
 rwilson: i've been wondering if you could 'airbender' to collect a horde - then coordinate to push them OUT of your base area to collect wild-mana from them, or just redirect most of them OUT.
 orangesnowfox: That's a strat that Eltrion talked about
 rwilson: i'm curious to try it - just not far enough along to worry about multi-stage gimick strats yet&#160;;) 
 MeWhenI: small improvement for airbender strat: don't wind opponents until they're behind you so you don't end up with a horde in front of you that you have 0 damage on
 orangesnowfox: counterpoint: if you damage them you can't collect wildmana
 MeWhenI: well yes assuming you dont go for that
 rwilson: countercounterpoint - make sure they're damaged but not dead before you push them out and collect wild mana&#160;;) 
 orangesnowfox: wildmana is based off of damage done with a hero outside your base
 orangesnowfox: damaging them directly removes from the amount of wildmana you get
 MeWhenI: counterpoint cubed: wild mana doesn't matter because i have 3 windspammers in your base and we aren't going to tiebreak
 rwilson: right - so airbender them away, just don't push them out till most are SLIGHTLY damaged, then quick kill outside the 'base' line. 
 orangesnowfox: if you have 3 windspammers in my base you now have 0 windspammers in my base lolol
 MeWhenI: shielded
 rwilson: also - curious if 2 windspammers would be enough to 'herd' all enemy heros into a pile and then trap somewhere.. 
 MeWhenI: id think 1 would be better so you have 2 heroes funding mana to the windspammer
 orangesnowfox: 1 is enough 
 rwilson: i was thinking 2 might be needed to do initial  ... group into a pile, then 1 to just wind them into a corner
 EvModder: can monsters spawn on the left and right walls? I only ever see them coming from the top or bottom
 rwilson: only 4 'areas' they come from
 rwilson: 2 spots , mirrored.
 EvModder: i don't see it documented anywhere, what are the areas?
 rwilson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/fbb4d12a07aa632b632d748d6c9a78a2b25e50ea/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Configuration.java#L26">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/fbb4d12a07aa632b632d748d6c9a78a2b25e50ea/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Configuration.java#L26</a>
 EvModder: thanks!
 JulienKerlero: if I mind control a monster and then hit it while inside my base, will it change focus and come to my base&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: nope
 orangesnowfox: if it gets inside your base it'll go for it
 orangesnowfox: but as long as it isn't moving towards it... There's no aggro
 rwilson: pretty sure it's more just 'distance' based -      like there's prolly some silly situation where you mind-control RIGHT as it's about to kill your base, but it doesn't walk all the way out in 1 turn - so next turn is still in the 'base attraction range' and would then retarget the base ...  
 orangesnowfox: exactly that yeah
 MeWhenI: i dont think so, u can mind control a guy well within your base and hell go away
 orangesnowfox: sauce?
 MeWhenI: If nearBase is 1: 1 if this monster is targeting your base, 2 otherwise.
 MeWhenI: from desc of threat_for
 MeWhenI: the existence of this implies nearBase targetting can be overridden
 orangesnowfox: ye, for one turn, then the mob goes "oh shoot, I'm near the base, better destroy it"
 Quidome: what is the githublink to the referee
 orangesnowfox: from the ref: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L494">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L494</a>
 orangesnowfox: Quidome: that but that's a specific file lol
 orangesnowfox: Also in the statement: 
 Quidome: great thnxs!
 rwilson: the relevant area is over here: 
 rwilson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/fbb4d12a07aa632b632d748d6c9a78a2b25e50ea/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L533">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/fbb4d12a07aa632b632d748d6c9a78a2b25e50ea/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L533</a>
 orangesnowfox: yep, it'll retarget the base as long as it ends its turn in range of it
 Quidome: nice thnxs
 rwilson: so long as mob isn't actively being controlled ... jus tthe distance matters...   but it's prolly KINDA rare that you don't get it to walk OUT during that 1 turn timeframe.
 MeWhenI: oh thats kinda lame
 orangesnowfox: rwilson it isn't that it's rare that you don't get it to walk out... it's that you just won't control it out if it won't leave by the end of the turn... Unless you do a control+wind combo??
 orangesnowfox: control a mob and yeet it on the same turn, then the next turn it leaves your base when it walks away
 orangesnowfox: actually, you could yeet it on the next turn, the movement will get canceled, but then it'll just move away the turn after...
 MeWhenI: if control doesn't direct them out of your base, i think it just wasnt designed as a defense spell
 orangesnowfox: I mean, it does... if they're barely inside your base
 JulienKerlero: Alright let's see if I can do better this time
 MeWhenI: got that yeah
 Quidome: Can you only control opponent heroes not monsters?
 Quidome: (with a spell)
 MeWhenI: no u can control both
 Quidome: hm, have to give the referee another look then :P
 rwilson: @orangesnowfox , right. i say RARE, in that i don't think many of us are trying to use control to get things out of our base....&#160;:)  ...  their speed is only 400 units per turn, but it's like 5000 units or so for the attraction...     wind  is the better call since they cost the same
 orangesnowfox: you can control both, I think you might even be able to control your own if you wanted to
 JulienKerlero: im wasting so much mana mind controlling mobs and killing them afterwards
 orangesnowfox: Julien: that's why I don't kill mobs after I MC them :p
 rwilson: @JulienKerlero - you and a LOT of people :p
 JulienKerlero: it's an easy fix tho
 orangesnowfox: rwilson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621626935">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621626935</a> turn 105, defensive MC
 rwilson: easy until you need to remember which ones had a LONG walk &amp; then you need to walk AROUND them to avoid helping your enemy :p
 orangesnowfox: again on 116
 orangesnowfox: and 117
 orangesnowfox: :p I use it a *lot* lategame when I win
 orangesnowfox: its a lot rarer that I use it once the mob enters the base, tbf, it... Does happen though
 rwilson: @orangesnowfox - love it, but those are all defences before they are INSIDE the base line&#160;;)    great stuff though - i don't have that yet.
 orangesnowfox: it's rarer purely because there's a 1 turn window and typically more important things to do :p
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621615067">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621615067</a> turn 117 I'm *one* turn off of doing it right after it gets in
 orangesnowfox: generally, doing things earlier is better, is my motto :p
 rwilson: @orangesnowfox true - but super nice to just toss a MC from max distance &amp; turn around to go deal with a bigger mob of junk coming in ... 
 MeWhenI: hm, i imagine mind control strats should have a turn number, like 200 or something, where they stop using MC and only use wind cuz the enemies wont make it to the other base in time
 rwilson: @MeWhenl - just keep in mind MC isn't JUST to taget the enemy base --- it's distance is super long compared to wind...  so saves you some walking ...   might still be smart to 'snipe' single creeps to turn around whilst you smack a horde.
 MeWhenI: fair
 orangesnowfox: ~27 turns  to make it across the map horizontallythat too, it's nice for slowing small hoards down
 orangesnowfox: might let you farm some wildmana early game too...
 orangesnowfox: hmm, no.
 orangesnowfox: late game tho
 MeWhenI: hm i wonder if in my aggro strat i should shield the opponent just so i dont launch them with the spider and let them easily catch up
 rwilson:&#160;;) one thing i've not looked at yet ---  is using MC to redirect mobs NOT at the enemy - but to cluster them and kill faster 
 orangesnowfox: that isn't... as useful, although, you did remind me that you can very easily get rid of mobs out of bounds if you wanted to :p
 orangesnowfox: that might actually be better than MCing them into the opponents base if they're airbending
 rwilson: Ahh, right ... so long as they aren't in base range ... 
 MeWhenI: yeah, if you have a jungler farming wild mana and know his trajectory you could just launch spiders at him and use him as your janitor
 orangesnowfox: the hero mafia 
 rwilson: 1 - 2 hydouken 
 WES.: salamo3likom
 EvModder: is my base always 0, 0? I've never seen it anywhere else
 MeWhenI: oops, just realized i havent been checking if i have mana before trying to cast a spell
 MeWhenI: its either 0,0 or 17630, 9000
 EvModder: Yeah, that's what the documentation says, but I've never had a game where I am in the bottom corner
 MeWhenI: i think in IDE ur always 0,0, but in the arena u can be either
 EvModder: Ahh ok
 rwilson: @EvModder - that because in the IDE , botton center you have players set up as you on the left and prolly Default AI on the right... you can delete &amp; re-add yourself on the other side 
 Enknable: Play as Red.
 Enknable: Then you will be 17630, 9000
 EvModder: not sure how to swap my color
 rwilson: bottom center .. loook for    "PLAYER | OPTIONS "
 Enknable: Delete ur avatar from bottom 75% from left
 Enknable: Then add the boss
 EvModder: ahh ok, deleting worked thanks
 Enknable: then do the same for the boss with yourself.
 Enknable: :thumbsup_tone1:
 MeWhenI: oh neat you can add anyone as your opp
 MeWhenI: i didnt know that
 Enknable: anyone within your league I believe
 MeWhenI: time to run it against butcher13
 Enknable: It does get restricted in some manner eventually
 rwilson: "Now you know. And knowing is ...."
 MeWhenI: power
 Enknable: "..half the battle"?
 MeWhenI: and power is evil
 rwilson:&#160;;) you're my friend now Enknable&#160;;) 
 MeWhenI: oh jeez butcher13 just pulls my heroes away from the monsters they're attacking
 MeWhenI: smart
 MeWhenI: top 50!
 Enknable: :yin_yang: rwilson
 rwilson: @MeWhenl , sweet! :trophy:
 MeWhenI: wait this version of the bot is popping off
 MeWhenI: top 20
 Mortis_666: 👏
 orangesnowfox: noice!
 rwilson: :cake::trophy:
 rwilson: ... then @rwilson's bot meets @MeWhenl's bot .... 
 zakacat: take taco
 JulienKerlero: Will I make it to top 100&#160;? :0
 MeWhenI: if youre in bronze, you can try out your bot against top 100 players in the IDE
 JulienKerlero: I did
 MeWhenI: howd it go
 JulienKerlero: most of them are too strong&#160;:(
 JulienKerlero: but I beat some
 MeWhenI: lol fair enough
 JulienKerlero: I can defend a bit but I havent tried attacking yet
 MeWhenI: if ur beating some tho sounds like a good start
 JulienKerlero: nor farming
 MeWhenI: aha yeah
 MeWhenI: likes like ur heroes usually end up grouping up on 1 mob
 zakacat: noob question here
 zakacat: I don't need to wait or anything for the battles in progress, or do I?
 MeWhenI: wym?
 MeWhenI: like setting a timer?
 zakacat: I click test in arena
 zakacat: for the Spring challenge
 MeWhenI: ah yeah
 zakacat: then it says battles in progress and shows me some of them
 zakacat: and it is quite slow
 MeWhenI: yeah it seems to play the matches relatively slow
 MeWhenI: nothing u can do ab that
 zakacat: ah, right, so I need to actually wait out the matches until the end or it won't log my results?
 Enknable: just dont submit again
 Enknable: you can keep coding in your local IDE
 MeWhenI: well you can leave the site if thats what u mean, itll run your bot in the background
 JulienKerlero: Yup you can change your code and try it in the IDE but don't submit or it'll start all over again
 zakacat: ahhh
 Enknable: I think everytime you "PLAY YOUR CODE"
 Enknable: it saves it 
 Enknable: so, if you write code you want to keep just play it
 rwilson: @zakacat - yes , basically -- don't 'test in arena' very fast ...     use the IDE "PLAYER | OPTIONS " area to change your opponents .. test out new strategies and find a good improvement, THEN submit to arena
 zakacat: awesome
 zakacat: okay thanks for the info
 rwilson: submits to arena take a chunk of time...   but yo ucan make good progress testing things on individual opponents ...  
 Enknable: good luck, eh!
 JulienKerlero: 111st, will I make it&#160;?
 zakacat: but also say it is bed time now and I like my current code and I want to shut down my computer, I don't need to be on the side. It will continue the battles while I am gone like what MeWhenl said?
 zakacat: site*
 rwilson: yes
 zakacat: and ty Enknable
 Enknable: you can also check out
 Enknable: the CodingGame extension
 Enknable: it lets you connect your Online IDE to something like VSCode
 Enknable: and then...
 Kururugi: rwilson how do we change opponents in player options? Is there any trick with including seed, etc?
 Enknable: you could even commit your submits
 Enknable: that'd be legit
 Enknable:&#160;!
 Enknable: glhf zakacat
 rwilson: @Kururugi - look for "PLAYERS | OPTIONS | " at bottom center .. under your AVATAR &amp; your opponents avatar is 'DELETE' 
 zakacat: Oh, man, there is an extension? that is awesome
 rwilson: you can delete them &amp; then ADD new ones, to test out other opponents, or to swap from BLUE side to be RED side ( left / right  , spots )
 rwilson: @zakacat - extension i super nice if for a number of cases... but web IDE is great for quick starts and 'dabbles'  ... extension can be a bit weird .. but super nice to use your local IDE with all it's built in navigation &amp; such ...
 Kururugi: Thanks a lot. 
 zakacat: Yah, thanks for the info peeps
 zakacat: GN
 JulienKerlero: I was 86 and I got demoted to 100th è_é
 SabertheLost: drop 22-&gt; 109 after i went to bed. expected&#160;:) 
 kirito_kun051: hello
 Palmipedus: Hello, when you CONTROL a monster is the vector override too?
 Uljahn: yes
 pychainman: howdy
 rwilson: @Palmipedus - yes , when you "SPELL CONTROL &lt;id&gt; X Y"   the monster stays going that direction till something else changes it ... ( heros only do it for 1 turn )
 pychainman: So only wood 2, wood 1 and bronze division so far I see
 Palmipedus: thanks everyone
 rwilson: Silver opens in like ~60 hours or so ... ( Sunday - ish if you're USA time )
 rwilson: Bronze though is the LAST of the new rules ...  so it's just differnt Tiers of peeps Bots from here on out.
 pychainman: :ok_hand:
 ytaya: there is nay way i can select clash mode
 ytaya:&#160;?
 IvesL: you need to go to "compete" and select clash if you dont want to join the event one
 kurnevsky: Hm, do I get it right that truncation rule is implemented incorrectly?
 kurnevsky: From the code symmetricTruncate does sub(origin).truncate().add(origin) but this origin is integer.
 kurnevsky: So it's actually always truncated, not rounded up.
 kurnevsky: Ah, nevermid. It will become negative&#160;:)
 karliso: "After an entity moves towards a point, its coordinates are truncated (when below halfway across the map) or rounded up (when above halfway across the map"
 karliso: It does seem that code is wrong though: 0.5 will be rounded up to 1.0, but 1000.5 will be truncated to 1000. Which is opposite of how I interpret above statement.
 karliso: 10000.5 that is.
 karliso: Unless by "below halfway" is meant visually (that is higher coordinates are rounded truncated), but then "below" is awkward to interpret for what it means for horizontal direction.&#160;:)
 ferdzi: I beat the BOSS 1 in Spring challenge but i did't get League promotion? .. i tested my bot in ARENA and my score is bigger than BOSS 1
 dbdr: ferdzi, you need to wait until your matches are over
 ferdzi: dbdr aa I see there is BATTLES IN PROGRESS 43% :D okay
 Illedan: Hi
 Illedan: Where in the code is the truncation done karliso? Didn't find it yet
 dbdr: Illedan <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L164">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/3297c5714be55f900028750e8ecb8b51d6aa4551/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L164</a>
 Illedan: Ah, just a wierd way of doing it :P
 dbdr: how would you do it?
 Illedan: Just throw an if in there. Far easier to track
 dbdr: you're not a mathematician&#160;;)
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: :d
 Illedan: Ok, I changed my stupid if to do that thing
 Illedan: Of to important stuff
 Illedan: *off
 burnpanck: Illedan: make sure you do an if on both coordinate components (x &amp; y); the explanation may be a bit unclear on that, but the distinction below/above really applies to both coordinate values individually and has nothing to do with "visually below/above"
 Illedan: Yeah, I understood when I saw the code. I had previously just checked  X &lt; half 
 Illedan: Slow battles&#160;:/
 msumera: What is the requirement to be promoted to silver league?
 Illedan: Wait until monday
 Illedan: before it is revealed
 aCat: Ille you code in proper objects? Points, etc or optimizing something?
 Illedan: Proper
 aCat: Ehhh, I will probably write the proper Vec/Point class also
 aCat: because working on separate ints will be pain with all these operations
 aCat: but - even if you truncate wrong youre off by 1  only&#160;;-)
 Illedan: That is important
 Illedan: When you gonna sim
 Illedan: Every pixel counts
 aCat: :crying_cat_face:
 aCat: I know.... but ...
 Illedan: Depends what rank you aim for :P
 aCat: very funny ^^
 Illedan: 99&#160;% it wont count
 Illedan: But 99&#160;% of 5k players are only top 50&#160;;)
 dbdr: arg. looks like the input does not contain spiders out of bounds, even if they are already on the viewer and will be in bounds next turn
 llllllllll: Eval servers: :fire:
 SigTrent: In Python, how do you turn the Id into a string to make the commands that require ID
 dbdr: basically you get get mana from hitting spiders which are not in the input :D
 Illedan: oh
 Illedan: they are outside the screen?
 Illedan: lol
 Illedan: You spawn camping? :O
 llllllllll: SigTrent: f"CAST CONTROL {id} {x} {y}"
 llllllllll: or you cast it to str()
 llllllllll: or use "....".format()
 VelinorErethil: It's SPELL, not CAST, but apart from that agreed.
 dbdr: Illedan just by accident
 SigTrent: Hmmm, my issue is the data type of the _id its using which is some unique identifier type...
 SigTrent: So cast into a string it seems to be an identification of the class rather than a value.
 iBug: hello
 SigTrent: (New to python and its classes)
 SigTrent: So casting it into string it gives me "&lt;built-in function id&gt;"
 llllllllll: thats something else. be carul of using "id" as a variable name, as its a built in keyword
 SigTrent: Ah, that's probably what's up. thanks.
 Uljahn: you have to use ID provided by the inputs, not a built-in function
 SigTrent: I did, but I think the other reference on the class I made is over-riding the reference.
 pychainman: So _id 0,1,2 are alway referring to your 3 heroes I take it.
 Illedan: If you are player 0
 pychainman: Okay, but you are always player 0 I think?
 Codeblood: has anyone solved there is no spoon? he says hardcoding isn't allowed. are we looking at brute force&#160;?
 Illedan: no pychainman
 Illedan: Delete your player in the Players list below your IDE code
 Illedan: and swap order
 pychainman: :thumbsup: oh thanks I see now
 dbdr: spider with yspeed of 69 happily goes down with 70 every turn. oh joy...
 Tanvir: Can anyone give me some idea abou the default AI? Is it coded by someone or chosen from the participants?
 Illedan: lol dbdr
 Illedan: I guess it is not rounded internally
 Illedan: xD
 aCat: really?
 aCat: so like you have to store doubles
 aCat: no - even that won;t help
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: Just assume -1 range
 dbdr: but the input is truncated
 dbdr: so you don't even know the real value
 Illedan: and call it a day
 Illedan: :sob
 Illedan: sob:
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jacek: :upside_down:
 dbdr: not sure in what case that matters though, since a single step should be less than 1, and it's truncated after move
 aCat: range -1 for hero attack, range+1 for base radius ;p
 Illedan: When is the CONTROL movement done?
 aCat: the turn after
 Illedan: Is it the same for monsters and heroes?
 Illedan: Yeah, but in the order list
 kovi: control is first
 Illedan: Does a controlled hero move before or after wind
 Illedan: Same with monster
 Illedan: And does a controlled monster still move if blown away with wind
 aCat: I suppose control just everrides a move command
 aCat: so everything else works the same?
 aCat: (not 100% sure)
 ClementC: 6. WIND spells are applied to entities in range. 7. OVE all monsters according to their current speed, unless they were pushed by a wind on this turn. 
 ClementC: MOVE*
 Illedan: Yeah, but that doesn't include CONTROL :P
 Illedan: but a monster move with control on the same time it moves normally 
 ClementC: that was for the wind question 
 Illedan: And a monster blown away will not move if controlled
 ClementC: I guess so
 Illedan: I found the code and concluded with above.
 kovi: afaik it is really replacing action with that move action
 kovi: anyone tested mutual control?
 aCat: so what is the answer&#160;? if monster controlled and winded, control is dropped?
 aCat: and it moves randomly?
 Illedan: Yeah
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 therealbeef: that sounds like a bug tbh
 therealbeef: does that mean you can counter an expected control with a quick wind?
 aCat: on a monster
 aCat: seems
 Illedan: Yeah
 kovi: oh, shield is not instant
 Illedan: Nope
 pychainman: How long do games take to show up in battle arena?  Seems very slow right now. 
 kovi: it was slow an hour ago, now its totally stuck
 pychainman: I'm stuck at battle progress 33% in the arena.
 Mortis_666: i submitted 2 hrs ago and its still at 38%
 ferdzi: I am also stuck at 63%
 Notter: What would happen if a monster gets affected by two completely opposite CONTROL spells?
 aCat: average
 Kururugi: the averageof directions will be where it travel
 Notter: But since the spell directions are completely opposite of each other, the monster wouldn't move
 Notter:&#160;?
 einaj: seems like the  server is stuck or something, i am not getting any more battles than the initial 10?
 Kururugi: it is same for lot of us here
 simonmtr: average is depending on direction though. if its not directly the opposite direction it will move somewhere @Notter
 independentac: Hi!  :)  Anyone knows how to close this chat?
 Shazbaz: click the triangle in the lower left of this chat box
 IvesL: chat bottom left "arrow"
 aCat: triangle on the bottom left
 independentac: Yew, ty. But it doesnt close. its minimized
 Shazbaz: That's all you get, I think
 aCat: ah, there was possible to add variable to page URL to completely shut down
 independentac: hmm. Dint happen to me before. it's been closed until today.  :)
 aCat: but don't use -&gt; don't remember&#160;:(
 independentac:&#160;:)
 Shazbaz: Has anyone here already done the War game?
 dbf: is there any issue with CG servers for now? I submitted code to arena and don't see any games played
 Sneffos: When does the silver league open pls&#160;?
 Uljahn: monday, Sneffos
 Shazbaz: @dbf I've got no idea what's going on since I'm new here, but I've seen people here talking about server issues for a couple hours now
 Sneffos: Uljahn and then every day for the next one&#160;? (thanks)
 wlesavo: dbf, yeah, i think it is gonna be like this until the silver opens, and even than i wouldnt rasie hopes too much 
 Uljahn: every two days
 Shazbaz: I'm just wondering, could someone tell me why this:
 Shazbaz: (int i = 0; i &lt; holding2-&gt;size())
 Shazbaz: would be different from this:
 Shazbaz: (!spoilsOfWar-&gt;empty())
 Shazbaz: pretend those are the same variable name
 Shazbaz: first one is a for loop, second one is a while loop
 Shazbaz: I have everything set up to work with queues. I have one for each player in the game of war, and then a holding queue for each as well. turns out the issue I was encountering was because the for loop wasn't completely emptying the winnings into the winner's deck and was holding on to some, but the while loop doesn't have this issue
 dbf: thanks, Shazbaz, wlesavo. At least for wood 2 it is super slow now
 wlesavo: dbf bronze is the same 334 computing rn
 wlesavo: Shazbaz changing the size of container in a for loop is a bad idea, since you will mess up indexing
 Shazbaz: ohhhhh, right, that makes sense
 dbf: lol, no hope for fast submit even if I reach bronze&#160;:)
 Shazbaz: This is my first time using the built-in &lt;queue&gt; in C++ instead of having to build my own janky ADT for it, and that completely slipped my mind!
 jordonez: when does silver league open? sunday?
 VizGhar: yes
 Nehrz: Hello, anyone else stuck at a&#160;% of combat&#160;? I'm above the boss but won't be promoted.
 Jokras: Yes
 abt8601: I'm progressing very slowly (1 battle in the last 30min)
 BrunoFelthes: if i set the target above the 800 range, how can I calculate the x,y with at the maximum range?
 jacek: i wonder if this morning submit will get me to bronze
 jacek: progress 25% ;s
 Astrobytes: by Sunday perhaps :P
 llllllllll: WOW, I submitted ~3 hours ago and im at 42%
 Astrobytes: This is pretty damn slow even by regular contest standards
 l10r: can I upload a file to use in my code?
 abt8601: AFAIK, no
 Uljahn: yes, but you have to place the file within your code
 tealfrog: are there time limits for progressing to the next league?
 dbf: l10r you need to merge everything into 1 file
 tealfrog: in other words is it a concern? how much time is needed to progress through all of them?
 jacek: no time limit
 tealfrog: and what happens when I submit a new version while old one is in progress?
 jacek: it will discard current battles and start over in ranking
 Uljahn: the progress will be dismissed
 Eacaw: Is anyone else's progress being real slow in the arena?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 jacek: time for csb promotion :imp:
 tealfrog: yes, i am stucked at 33%, 21st game in progress
 abt8601: The old one is cancelled, AFAIK
 tealfrog: thanks, so if I feel it will make it I should keep an update for the next league
 tealfrog: how number of games in the last battles correspond to the progress? My games went from 17 to 21 but progress stays at 33%
 Milanovich: Anyone know where to find fix for grey screen for spring challenge?
 jacek: restart tab?
 LordSkaven: hmmm I suspect to do really well in this challenge you need a designated hero in the enemy base helping the monsters
 VizGhar: LordSkaven devil is in details
 jacek: like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621421187">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621421187</a>
 LordSkaven: yep
 l10r: did someone use AI in the challenge?
 IvesL: i think it is better to have idle units to slay closest monsters for mana rather than just wait
 dbf: can anyone please share a link to bronze pdf rules?
 LordSkaven: yeah IvesL, I noticed the same with my current bot. Need to implement still tho lol
 EvModder: how long does it take for the league promotions to happen? i've kind of just been sitting/waiting for an hr here lol
 l10r: can you use AI in the codingames?
 jacek: until all your fights are done. but servers are really slow today
 Jerrasterix: when is the next league promotion&#160;??
 Jerrasterix: to silver&#160;??
 EvModder: apparently it's taking a while because the servers are slow
 Astrobytes: sunday
 EvModder: i'm waiting for wood 1 lmao; haven't lots a single match yet tho so i've just started working on the features that will be unlocked in silver
 Jerrasterix: hmm... have 2 days to work on **sigh**
 wlesavo: EvModder you mean bronze? there wont be new features in silver
 Astrobytes: wlesavo :wave:
 EvModder: oh yeah bronze
 wlesavo: hi astro :slight_smile:
 EvModder: i haven't done anything on this website since the packman game so i'm still re-learning the terms
 synchoz: BATTLES IN PROGRESS 0% for like 10 mins 
 EvModder: frozen at 33% here for 55mins
 PascalSCoder: This button "GET A JOB" feels kinda offensive lol
 EvModder: LMAO i know right xD
 synchoz: 33% for 55 mins ok then im good 
 synchoz: i thought i was stuck because last time i played this was a bit faster XD
 EvModder: same lol
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: you moved to Kazakhstan? Work?
 EvModder: i think they made the map resolution too big for their computers to handle
 tobk: Submitted 1h ago, still at 10 battles (20%)...&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: tobk: servers are melted currently&#160;:(
 wlesavo: Astrobytes nah, just in case, i really dint wanna miss the contest if there would be a policy change :slight_smile:
 tobk: Yeah, I mean, who could have expected _that_...&#160;:-P
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: ah, gotcha. Good move 
 Astrobytes: lol tobk
 Spalmon: wait why is the boss ranked like 200
 VizGhar: Default bot outputs incorrect output and I lost :P
 EvModder: lol blame the servers
 Westicles: they are going to remove the get a job service
 tobk: Spalmon Probably 200 waiting for their promotion to next league, but fights not 100% over.
 EvModder: "GET A JOB"
 EvModder: is there a way to view the rules in bronze before i actually get there so i can start working on that version of the bot?
 tobk: There's a link to a PDF in the mail you got when it started.
 EvModder: alr, thanks
 EvModder: sorry for all the questions, this website feels sooo different from last time i did a contest
 moidda: battles in progress is at 0%
 synchoz: ye i havnt made contest over a year now :D
 Jerrasterix: in top 10 no one is recognizable :O
 synchoz: moidda  wait till u get to 33%
 wlesavo: Jerrasterix Psyho is
 wlesavo: SlyB also
 Jerrasterix: Idk them
 Astrobytes: lol
 EvModder: i mean, idk any1 tbh
 synchoz: i only know astro :D
 Westicles: I went to high school with toto0121, data his sister
 synchoz: btw what happen to the mod sign you used to have&#160;? :O 
 Westicles: *dated
 EvModder: this challenge i will try and code as much as possible in the built-in ide
 EvModder: last time i did it in vim and then screwed up and lost hours of progress (which i still use as excuse for not making top10 lol)
 EvModder: the ide here is actually really smooth in most cases
 Wontonimo: you should get an achievement for using vim
 EvModder: lol yeah, but no easy way for the website to detect it 
 EvModder: vim is really cool tho, still very well maintained and super mod-able
 dbdr: EvModder: vim + git&#160;;)
 EvModder: = full featured ide&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: I use vi once in a while
 EvModder: vi is basically just TextEditor for terminals
 Wontonimo: yup
 Jerrasterix: Hello Wontonimo, long time no see :wave:
 Wontonimo: hey hey Jerrasterix&#160;!  I've been watching youu on the leaderboard
 EvModder: still 33% so i think i'll go to bed, see y'all tomorrow&#160;:)
 Jerrasterix: humph.... don't 
 synchoz: :o
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Hi, why the progress is 33%? 
 dbf: servers are overloaded
 Astrobytes: completely stuck now are they?
 Astrobytes: and hi dbf :wave:
 dbf: hi Astrobytes!
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: My problem is Wood 2 League. Is there only one problem?
 Illedan: Is wild mana calculated by the hero distance or monster distance?
 VizGhar: distance?
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: My problem is Wood 2 League. Is there only one problem?
 Wontonimo: wild is colleced by heros when more than 5000 away from base
 Illedan: Ok, so the hero is used as a distance measure
 Illedan: ty
 Illedan: I used monster distance&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: np Illedan!  Nice to see you again o/
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: I'm around for the good stuff&#160;;)
 _NikJ: Servers still lazy?
 dbdr: 1 year since last bot contest!
 Astrobytes: yep
 VizGhar: as usual&#160;:)
 Illedan: Wish I could register my computer as a server and help on the load :P 
 _NikJ: ++++ same
 _NikJ: Are there any rule changes from wood2 to wood1? I started this morning, but I'm stuck at 33% battles
 dbf: just send your bots to me instead of submit to arena, and I'll run some games&#160;:)
 dbdr: CG could just run 50 battles in bronze, not 100, that's largely sufficient at this level
 dbf: oh, 100 games
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Hi, I have beaten the first Boss. How can i access the higher league?
 Astrobytes: can't see anything changing anytime soon dbdr&#160;;)
 dbf: YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong  wait for all games and promotion
 _NikJ: You have to wait for all battles to complete, after that you get a promotion. Battle completion will take awhile, since servers are kinda burning atm :D
 VizGhar: YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong come back tomorrow&#160;:)
 VizGhar: OK. I've made a submit... I'll check in 5 hours... bye :P
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Oh, Thank you for your reply. See you tomorrow
 Spalmon: do the battles continue if my computer dies?
 _NikJ: Yes, they're done on CG server
 Spalmon: ok cool
 VaseSimion: Anyone knows when the next league starts?
 Quidome: sunday
 AlMualem: Sunday at 2:00 pM
 Jokras: Anyone Knows why Computing is so slow?
 dbf: Jokras, a lot of players, servers are busy
 abt8601: Maybe their servers are down
 SergeyShirokov: So sloooooow
 Jokras: ok so its because of the meny players
 Jokras: so it will get faster agian at some time
 Jokras: Almost 1/3 of the players are computing (950 Players)
 dbf: Jokras, yes, but for now computing queue is only increasing
 TrashTyper: Can you see your position in the queue?
 dbf: it was ~750 about an hour ago
 Westicles: anyone remember the russian AI 2013 contest?  was it like this?
 dbf: Westicles check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206680/</a>
 dbf: looks different
 Westicles: ah, okay.  codebusters PMs referenced that one
 dbf: TrashTyper there is no queue, games are played for everyone, I mean list of players who are not computed
 llllllllll: damn, 4 hours and still at 42%
 llllllllll: I assume resubmitting wont solve anything 
 Psyho: the only solution is to have extremely aggressive tactic so your games end faster
 Icemore: resubmitting will put ypu at 0% lol
 llllllllll: I guess my "try not to lose" tactic is not ideal then 
 Jokras: now there are 965 players computing and the number is growing
 wlesavo: Psyho 1st turn timeout tactic :smiley:
 Astrobytes: lol
 abt8601: :rofl:
 Jokras: 😂
 Psyho: it's a double win since you also get very consistent results!
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 jrke: i am waiting when the computing section touches 1k players
 abt8601: Well, what if both players use this tactic?
 jrke: :grin:
 llllllllll: where can you check on the queue
 llllllllll: ah, score: computing I guess
 Jokras: at the leaderboard there you can filter Score:Computing and then you see the number of results
 Jokras: now at 972
 Jokras: AHHHHH I found something I need to change in my coed, but I don't want to re compute
 Illedan: The contest is 10 days away from the end. Fix it and don't submit :P
 Jokras: Ok I wil do That&#160;:)
 IvesL: always have backup in your IDE
 VizGhar: *Git
 IvesL: then just compete against top players
 IvesL: switch sides and test
 Jokras: I just copy the code from the IDE to a file on my computer after writing something
 DjTrilogic: is there a way to run the refree locally and test it against my c# code&#160;?
 DjTrilogic: has anyone done this&#160;? 
 jrke: yes DjTrilogic
 jrke: you can
 VizGhar: DjTrilogic every time some good soul creates brutaltester for this purposes... but still, you can find source code for this challenge on github and just run it
 DjTrilogic: yeah i've found the code... but i just have no clue yet on how to make my c# assembly interact with the refree (with UI) ...
 kurnevsky: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>
 DjTrilogic: (haven't looked into this that much tho... it could probably be done with standard input stuff. ..)
 kurnevsky: But this game has to be adapted to brutaltester&#160;:)
 DjTrilogic: thx @kurnevsky&#160;:)
 DjTrilogic: but i want to be able to run the refree UI locally as well, not just brutal testing ...
 Icemore: 1011 people "computing"rip servers
 Yorrick: how can I switch sides in my IDE?
 ntsd: Is go good for bot prammming?
 Astrobytes: RockyMullet spotted
 Kellthazar: @DjTrilogic I'm doing this with the referee repo
 RockyMullet: :eyes:
 Astrobytes:&#160;:) Nice to see ya
 RockyMullet: hi :joy:
 RockyMullet: yeah I kind of gave up on codingame then got a notification for this one and I like it :eyes:
 RockyMullet: gives me strong codebuster vibes and it was my favorite one
 Astrobytes: yeah, a lot of us did the same
 RockyMullet: finally can do some vector math :D
 Illedan: Hi Rocky&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: hey Illedan :wave:
 twiho: Yeah I think it is stuck right now. But I think they'll make it work soon
 RockyMullet: hum, yeah my submit is stuck after the initial 10 games
 Illedan: Hmm, I win 1st on mana gain for the first 60 rounds. Then I fail misserably xD
 RockyMullet: can we see somewhere the "wild mana" in the viewer&#160;?
 Illedan: Nope
 RockyMullet: sadness
 Illedan: You need to draw the game and not view in debug mode :P
 Kellthazar: My bot reach rank 214 without include "SHIELD" and "CONTROL" spells... 
 Th1nhNg0: me too, just use wind and defend
 TobiasA: my submit has been on 33% for 10 minutes:sob:
 llllllllll: im on 42% for 4 hours now
 TobiasA: the hell :o
 RockyMullet: yeah turtling means you will likely lose because of wild mana
 RockyMullet: you can generally manage to defend at 2 soldiers
 Illedan: Which is good
 RockyMullet: my offensive behavior is not on point yet, sometimes they are too stuburn and keep helping to defend :sweat_smile:
 RockyMullet: I need to implement more spells when defending, so far I pretty much only wind when monster are about to attack my base
 JRFerguson: hello global, despite the server collapse it's good to have a decent bot programming contest back&#160;;)
 JRFerguson: good to see you all here
 RockyMullet: yeah I didnt check that escape room thing at all and that other one with the trees and the sun pretty much made me quit codingame :sweat_smile:
 RockyMullet: this one is fun so far
 RockyMullet: there are no obvious solution
 RockyMullet: and a lot of possible strategies and counter strategies
 yg6yszdvgyfcsdfcddgbyfrceha: you win
 RockyMullet: I'm hyped
 Illedan: +1
 Illedan: I like this one
 yg6yszdvgyfcsdfcddgbyfrceha: -1900000000000000000000000
 Illedan: I just wish I had more time
 JRFerguson: yep, and it seems you can play with sims or with heuristics
 dbdr: should be meta-heavy, I suppose
 yg6yszdvgyfcsdfcddgbyfrceha: =1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
 elderlybeginner: sun/trees was not that bad. Escape room - that's not coding
 Illedan: Yeah
 yg6yszdvgyfcsdfcddgbyfrceha: 1-[
 RockyMullet: Illedan same, I didnt plan for it at all
 yg6yszdvgyfcsdfcddgbyfrceha:&#160;;[;]\/
 yg6yszdvgyfcsdfcddgbyfrceha: <i>[]]</i>]'
 yg6yszdvgyfcsdfcddgbyfrceha: ,./;[']\
 Illedan: Damn, I'm suddenly starting to lose all my mana
 Illedan: that might be a problem
 dbdr: I don't have that problem :D
 RockyMullet: I really should use more, I end most of my games with more than 400 mana, which seems like a waste
 elderlybeginner: Aren't servers down with every contest? :wink:
 dbdr: seen more than 1k mana when op is controlling spiders towards me :D
 wlesavo: i had some bugs where one hunter will just literally BLOW all my mana
 dbdr: would be cool if you could use all your mana at oncecontrol everything
 dbdr: or mana wars, if you spend more mana you win the control
 wlesavo: with a diversant in enemy base you want have much mana left
 elderlybeginner: spell apocalypse , clearing the whole map :joy:
 wlesavo: wont*
 wlesavo: yeah, pipelining spells would be fun
 tobk: Back after 90 minutes, meanwhile: 4 new battles... :scream:
 MarKes: New league opening time format?League opening: 1650812400000
 jrke: 3k + players!
 wlesavo: MarKes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/vZyuvP9">https://imgur.com/vZyuvP9</a>
 Poviliukas: back after 4hours  ~20 battles more but still same 80% in progress.&#160;:( is it stuck?
 aldo._.15: i won the boss 2 but i didn t pass .. why?
 IvesL: cuz you shall not pass
 aldo._.15: ur funny man
 Jokras: There are currently 1105 players computing
 IvesL: probably just server lagging
 aldo._.15: yeah
 Astrobytes: they're working on it
 aldo._.15: same happend 10  hr ago
 IvesL: your status should be like rank stablizing sth like that
 jacek: they wait for friday evening to deploy things. have patiene
 Astrobytes: jacek :rofl:
 RockyMullet: yeah that ranking will be chaotic, too many people not stabilized, the ranking will be all over the place
 IvesL: im thankful to sneak into bronze yesterday
 elderlybeginner: MarKes  standard for D/H/MN/SC?
 KiwiTae: im so disappointed you can't display emoticons&#160;:( 
 RockyMullet: what&#160;??? you used to
 RockyMullet: I want to show chickens :cry:
 Illedan: unplayable
 Thheo: is the default ai the same as the bronze boss will be?
 Illedan: No
 KelvinAndHubbles: bronze will be some random high ranked player I believe
 Illedan: Boss is picked from players around center
 Dapps: How many usually get promoted to silver when it opens? Top 500?
 WannaBeHum1n: guys if i am above boss in ranking, di i get new division&#160;?
 jrke: yes
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx
 derjack: what if my bot would be picked as boss, but i adjusted its strength based on date and after that it always crashes?
 Illedan: Then they would be sad about the wasted time used on updating the boss to another code
 jrke: derjack after seeing this chat they are never gonna choose your bot as boss :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 VizGhar: Leaderboard is too weak looks like... my stupid bot is 88th after 50% of battles... do you guys think there are already bots for suitable for silver league?
 WannaBeHum1n: guys i am ranked above boss (63 in wood 1= but i didnt get new division
 WannaBeHum1n: am i missing smth
 jrke: WannaBeHum1n wait until all battles end
 IvesL: just ignore the current rank if you are high up there
 IvesL: you will be automatically promoted when new leagues are opened
 Mortis_666: does anyone know what rank is the bronze boss at?
 IvesL: bronze?
 VizGhar: Mortis_666 bronze boss will be picked from one of the players
 wlesavo: VizGhar for silver sure, i guess top1 will even make it to the gold without resubmiting
 Mortis_666: ohh
 VizGhar: wonder how hard will legend be... I'm too lazy to do search this time
 Jerrasterix: I am back after almost 5 hrs, still it is only 68% completed lol
 VizGhar: Jerrasterix it got a bit faster now
 IvesL: the league is relative, thats why they only open new leagues every few days
 Jerrasterix: hmm... lets see 
 IvesL: in other words, its more advantageous to start early, rather than in the last few days, given you are not that good
 IvesL: same code could be in gold in earlier days, but silver if you join too late, when there are more better players
 dbdr: not really, since the boss stays at the same level
 therealbeef: i don't think it matters much; the strength of your final submission determines where you end
 Illedan: Hmm, wlesavo. Don't like losing at round 150 xD
 struct: Hi

 Zenoscave: league opening shows up as a unix time stamp lmao nice regression there, CG
 dbf: is it a bug that boss'es rating is not displayed into leaderboard for 'last battles'?
 dbf: how to find his position quickly?
 struct: leaderboard?
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Hi, i access Wood 1 League. Can i return back to Wood 2 League?
 struct: no
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong:&#160;?? So my ranking cannot improve for Wood 2 League?
 struct: well if you are on wood 1 you are already better than those on wood 2
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: So final ranking depends on wood 1?
 struct: Final rank takes into account all leagues
 struct: The current highest league is bronze
 struct: but 3 more leagues will open next week
 struct: silver, gold and legend
 struct: Legend is the highest one
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: I optimize my code for wood 2 just now, but not submit :joy:
 NewCoder09: for what struct?
 NewCoder09: for spring challenge 2022?
 struct: yes NewCoder09 but they are not open yet
 struct: YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong the code still should work on wood 1
 struct: but now you get spells
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Ok, got it. Thanks
 Ez4: Hello! I have trouble configuring cg-brutaltester with the current spring challenge&#160;:/ I have warnings about log4j config missing, any one willing to help&#160;?
 TobiasA: will there be new rules after in silver
 TobiasA: *in silver
 Westicles: no
 TobiasA: cool
 VizGhar: Score computing &lt; 900... Looks like it's unclogged
 casmith789: from now on no new rules, divisions opening up will just have harder and harder entry requirements (the boss will be more advanced)
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: Do heroes chase monsters until they die?
 casmith789: they can do whatever you program them to do, including chasing monsters until they die, but the default code just has them wait where they are
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: Oh, I made an error
 Wizard-Dude: is there an way to find out if a spider is shielded?
 simonmtr: you can check shield health maybe?
 struct: its given on inputs
 simonmtr: shieldLife: the number of rounds left until entity's shield is no longer active. 0 when no shield is active.
 Wizard-Dude: thanks? 
 Wizard-Dude: Thanks!
 aguillaume: how often is league promotion? been at the top of  wood 2 for 40 min.. 
 msumera: after all your battles are finished
 struct: its kinda slow atm
 struct: too many submits
 PatrickMcGinnisII: probably it's the rank stabaliztion, depends on how many bots are currently moving around.... it was sloooow last night too
 struct: 746 submits atm
 Sorann753: yeah it's really slow today too
 Audatic: uhh top 20 with my old approach&#160;:) 
 einaj: will there be even more rules added in the silver and gold leagues, or is the game complete as it is in bronze
 Illedan: Complete in bronze
 einaj: ok. cool
 Illedan: Oh, more Norwegians :raised_hands:
 struct: is euler participating?
 Illedan: He lacks motivation
 einaj: :v:
 Illedan: Where in Norway einaj?
 dbdr: he said he took a holiday for it
 einaj: Oslo
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: Does it always put me in the top left hand corner (0,0)&#160;?
 zakacat: nope
 Sorann753: btw is there a discord for codinGame&#160;?
 zakacat: It switches
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: ok thx
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how come there's not like 500 people in world chat?  they just connect via Vim or some other means?  or can u turn off # world?
 zakacat: sorann, look at the top of the chat window
 Audatic: wohoo I am getting up there :D
 Audatic: rank 7 now
 struct: you can disconnect PatrickMcGinnisII
 struct: by adding ?disableChat
 struct: at end of url
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hard for me to believe alot of newcomers automatically do that tho
 zakacat: But everyone is still in bronze?
 VizGhar: PatrickMcGinnisII you only see those that are actually posting something into chat
 VizGhar: moderators see much more
 zakacat: Ohhh, Silver hasn't been opened yet
 jacek: wee bronze
 KiwiTae: someone with -0.38 score in wood 2 solid
 Illedan: Illedan failed a CONTROL: Hero 2 doesn't know where entity 137 is
 Illedan: -.-
 dbdr: lol
 Illedan: uhm
 kovi: nice try!
 Thibauld: What does that score mean? @KiwiTae
 Hamp: is it possible to get back the code you submitted? didn't remember to save it and now I have made changes
 Illedan: History Hamp
 Illedan: Left side of the screen
 Hamp: perfect, thank you :D
 Djellowman: what is wild mana? i can find no explanation, yet i'm randomly losing games that should be drawn
 AeroFlorian: it's mana you generate outside of your base
 Djellowman: yeah i found it now &gt;.&lt;
 AeroFlorian: by attacking monsters
 Djellowman: there goes my strat
 AeroFlorian: the tanking strat with wind goes away^^
 Djellowman: near_base and threat_for seem useless now

 jordonez: no monsters?
 VizGhar: lol... you just got promoted in Code Royale :D I've submitted bot like a week ago
 MindController: It doesnt even compile
 alexcercos: Is min in C++ for double only?
 Djellowman: look at the compilation error then
 Djellowman: maybe .size() returns size_t and i is int or something
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Can we assume my mana value is the value when i == 0&#160;?
 Quixx: both parameters have to be the same type. Try casting Monsters.size() to int
 jacek: even min(float,double) is a no-no
 dbdr: YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong no, you need to store the values as you wish
 MindController: It works now, thanks
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl is back \o/
 Djellowman: damn i havent touched spells, but getting rekt by people shoving spiders into my base
 Joe0: Hey, how fast do heroes move in the spring challenge?
 Joe0: nvrmnd
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: I mean, two groups value, the first group is my value? That's what i am not sure.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: SPELL SUMMON LIZARD 700 700 50 mana for 5 turns .  tail whip 10 dmg, on summon, eats mobs -on desummon releases mobs
 Thibauld: Yes first is always your value
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: OK, thanks. 
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr is back
 Djellowman: why does this site keep telling me to get a job
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: because you should get a job Djellowman
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Maybe it thinks you don't have a job:sweat_smile:
 Illedan: Get a job to take vacation to code CG?
 dbdr: you shouldn't, it's a trap!
 ntsd: What is the bronze rule?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjt9UsduRfU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjt9UsduRfU</a>
 ntsd: I am in wood 1 waiting for promotion
 eulerscheZahl: won't take too long. 2 more spells, that's it
 eulerscheZahl: "Mana is shared across the team and heroes can spend 10 mana points to cast a spell."weird way to say that a spell costs 10 mana
 Djellowman: will higher leagues still add more rules, or is it finished at bronze?
 eulerscheZahl: bronze rules are final
 Westicles: need to set up the taco bot to answer that one
 dbdr: I think they mean mana is not private to each hero
 ntsd: but in Gold they probably all simulate
 eulerscheZahl: oh, i can only cast 1 spell per turn in total?
 VelinorErethil: What is their definition of 'targeting' with a spell? i.e. does shield protect against wind, or just against control?
 dbdr: no, the mana
 Djellowman: what happens if a hero tries to cast a spell on a shielded entity? will they do a WAIT&#160;?
 VizGhar: eulerscheZahl no you can cast 3 :P
 dbdr: I wish we could multicast
 VelinorErethil: The spell fizzles, so they effectively do a wait
 Illedan: lol dbdr
 Illedan: 10 times Wind and instant win?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Need codingame::CON, like a comicon but with translator devices. *cringe*
 dbdr: save 1k mana, huge wind all across the map
 eulerscheZahl: like the chain in code of ice and fire
 dbdr: exactly
 Djellowman: how can you check if an entity is shielded then
 VelinorErethil: ShieldLife &gt; 0
 Djellowman: ah, shield_life
 Djellowman: thx
 eulerscheZahl: now i see you too dbdr <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/SCeolTG.png">https://i.imgur.com/SCeolTG.png</a>
 dbdr:&#160;:+1: got a terrible start
 Illedan: Excuses
 dbdr: and no spells :D
 Djellowman: okay another question, will spells immediately be cast? or what happens if in 1 round all 3 heroes cast shield or wind on the same entity
 eulerscheZahl: i still try to figure out whether i even like the game
 eulerscheZahl: but took off already, so i have to
 dbdr: you got 10 days to figure it out
 VelinorErethil: Wind: Added together. Shield: No point to it.
 eulerscheZahl: sunday evening is codejam. the saturday after too, if i fail
 VelinorErethil: Control: Averaged target
 eulerscheZahl: and another German contest on the last weekend of the CG contest
 Djellowman: what i meant is that, if i try to cast shield with hero 1, can the other heroes in the same turn see that shield_life &gt; 0?
 dbdr: I predict some promotions might be messy
 dbdr: with meta and ranking randomness
 Djellowman: or would shield_life be 0 until next turn
 dbdr: Djellowman best is to look at the code
 dbdr: github
 Djellowman: that's effort
 Djellowman: but i cheated and looked at the docs, which says: SHIELD spells are applied to the targets and will only be effective on the next turn, after the next batch of commands. Does not protect from a spell from this same turn.
 jordonez: who are promoted to silver?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: throw new ActionException("Entity " + victim.id + " has a shield up");
 Audatic: silver is only available on Sunday
 jordonez: i know
 Westicles: are the top guys on codebusters NN?
 jordonez: but which rank do i need to get promoted?
 Audatic: they will pick a player in the upper-middle as the new boss and promote everyone on top. Probably top 20% to be safe&#160;:)
 jordonez: ok, thanks!
 TobiasA: wait the bosses are peoples bots?:hushed:
 GetSchwifty: jordonez Battle of the ricks?
 Astrobytes: TobiasA from bronze onwards yes
 Wizard-Dude: So the person who is chosen as boss will not be allowed to rank up&#160;?
 Astrobytes: no they are promoted 
 Audatic: they just make a copy.
 TobiasA: hmm it will be nice to be a boss
 CoolandonRS: When I try to run my code, it says that compilation took too long. Is there a way to fix this? It was working fine before.
 ninjadip: infinite loop, or no output
 ninjadip: check for those
 CoolandonRS: no output?
 Djellowman: if compilation took too long it sounds like the servers are struggling
 CoolandonRS: Wait I might have just found what caused it but I don't know why it would
 Djellowman: how high do you have to finish an arena to promote?
 Djellowman: ah top 20%
 Thibauld: For now you just have to beat the boss
 Krabumb: When is silver going to be a thing&#160;? the date is malformed
 Djellowman: so it's easier to get promoted earlier in the hackathon
 CoolandonRS: If you fail a spell because the targets out of range does it use mana?
 pedrosorio: @Djellowman I believe they pick one of the contestants and freeze that bot as a boss when they open a new league. You have to be better than that boss in the ranking, so it doesn't matter if it's early or late in the competition.
 Djellowman: @pedrosorio thanks!
 Michael_Howard: Which base radius is used for wild mana, is it the fog one (6000) or the monster aggro one (5000)?
 Thibauld: 5000
 Thibauld: I asked the same yesterday, got pointed to the referee, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java</a>
 Michael_Howard: Thanks
 karliso: "Spells are cast in the order of the received output. This means a spell may be cancelled if another hero spent the necessary mana earlier in the turn." -- where does this rule apply?
 Thibauld: you have 10 mana, hero 0 casts a spell, you now have 0 mana, hero 1 tries to cast another spell, it fails
 therealbeef: CoolandonRS: nope, the mana is only spent if the target exists and is in range
 CoolandonRS: Alright thanks
 Djellowman: if you try to triple cast shield on the same entity, the 2nd and 3rd try will be cancelled
 therealbeef: if it's shielded you do spend the mana though
 karliso: Ahh, got it. However I am not sure there was need to document what happens when player spends more mana than he has.
 therealbeef: Djellowman, I think they are not cancelled, you pay the mana but they just overwrite the same effect
 Thibauld: SHIELD also protects entities from receiving a new SHIELD.
 BRETTRIVERBOAT: How do I go up in rank if I keep winning?
 wlesavo: dbdr i think closer to legend it will be less heuristic and more simulation heavy which will stabilize the meta
 dbdr: wlesavo, right, but you still need to guide the search with some metaheuristic, esp with the fog and randomness
 wlesavo: well yeah, the well known cg fog :smiley:
 Illedan: This wouldn't work without it :P
 dbdr: do we have foggy chess yet?
 Illedan: lol
 Thibauld: Yes
 Thibauld: fog of war chess on chess.com
 wlesavo: фтв еркуу ызудды фку фдьщые RPC 
 wlesavo: and three spells are almost RPC
 aCat: Amazonian or whatever it is called is foggy chess&#160;;]

 Illedan: Maybe with some news spells
 Illedan: hopefully

 wlesavo: lol
 wlesavo: so 2018
 Illedan: Sooo, time to go search github?
 Illedan: :P
 wlesavo: maybe top is the winner of that contest?))
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't say Amadeus as company. i know it's possible to switch within 4 years
 Djellowman: how do you know how far off you were from promotion? i just finished an arena run and i don't know what happened
 jacek: ai company... amadeus... makise kurisu?!
 eulerscheZahl: open the leaderboard. compare your score with boss score
 eulerscheZahl: the boss should be at or near the top
 ScienceGuy66: hm
 Westicles: 4 years of beta testing...
 Westicles: how did you find that euler?
 Djellowman: @euler thanks
 Djellowman: no boss there.. maybe because its bronze league?
 Wontonimo: oh, there has been quite a bit or bot improvements in the last 8 hours.  I was 250th, now I'm 430th
 Wontonimo: *bit of bot improvements
 orangesnowfox: morning all
 Wontonimo: wave
 orangesnowfox: Wontonimo just about same, 250ish 417ish
 jacek: or ranking fluke
 orangesnowfox: bronze gained like 500 people too
 therealbeef: earlier today someone said that they used exactly this game (same rules) as a private contest in his company some years ago
 Djellowman: someone told me they are in gold league.. bronze is the highest possible rn right?
 DjTrilogic: are you able to see the fog when debugging locally&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: DjTrilogic you mean in the viewer?
 DjTrilogic: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i dropped 500 overnight, but I've only submitted twice, heh
 Rag: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/AmadeusNice/status/1042783736713105408">https://twitter.com/AmadeusNice/status/1042783736713105408</a>
 Rag: how is this possible?
 jacek: the what
 orangesnowfox: in the settings (the cog) there's an option to show what player 1 sees, what player 2 sees, turn off fog of war, and what both players see combined
 Rag: check 1st picture
 DjTrilogic: amazing&#160;! thx
 therealbeef: So, amadeus for company #1?
 eulerscheZahl: "how did you find that euler?"was looking for CG hackathons a long time ago, curious what content we missed out on
 eulerscheZahl: the background this time looked familiar, so i searched again
 Wontonimo: current stats:311 in Wood 2692 in Wood 12340 in Bronze
 eulerscheZahl: "earlier today someone said that they used exactly this game (same rules) as a private contest in his company some years ago"oh, i missed that message. sad
 eulerscheZahl: but shows our standing as a community in the eyes of CG
 orangesnowfox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/621626935">https://www.codingame.com/replay/621626935</a> oh, my god
 Wontonimo: very sad that this isn't original
 Westicles: two samsung in the top10, maybe they already had it too
 Rag: sad
 Husoski: I'm getting spiders with a linear speed greater than 400...is that an error in the statement, or did I miss something?
 Wontonimo: it may explain why the game seems balanced, it's been play tested
 orangesnowfox: Husoski is it like... 400.5 or smth?
 Wontonimo: or was wind used on them?
 Husoski: More like 465
 Husoski: vx=-242, vy=-318
 Husoski: nvm ... bad copy/paste to calculator
 Psyho: math is hard&#160;;)
 Husoski: (did it with fingers instead of mouse)
 Husoski:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: I'll forgive you just this one time
 orangesnowfox: heh
 orangesnowfox: it's fine
 Husoski: so I see, thanks!
 Wontonimo: no problem, I'm generious
 Illedan: Damn, so many bugs
 Illedan: Spawning 4 new every 5 sec -.-
 RandomSteve: how do I stop getting notifications of contributions?
 eulerscheZahl: go to your profile settings to turn it off RandomSteve
 Wontonimo: top right, drown down, settings
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl I guess the pros gotta put the ones who have seen this event before in their place
 eulerscheZahl: i'm still a bit disappointed that we apparently don't even deserve an original contest anymore
 eulerscheZahl: what's next? we have no contest on stock, back to escape?
 Scarfield: This is a repeat?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, from 2018
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/AmadeusNice/status/1042783736713105408/photo/1">https://twitter.com/AmadeusNice/status/1042783736713105408/photo/1</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dni2R7fUwAElBnz?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dni2R7fUwAElBnz?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096</a>
 RandomSteve: ok I've found it and I turned it off tysm
 Thibauld: Do I see it correctly, that if you CONTROL a spider towards the enemy base, threat for is not set to 2?
 Djellowman: can we currently advance beyond bronze?
 Wontonimo: silver has not been unlocked yet Djellowman
 eulerscheZahl: just wait until 1650812400000
 Asterixk: lol
 Astrobytes: heh
 Audatic: Thibauld I don't think so. I think it updates. Maybe somebody wants to check the source code? XD
 fprado: Hello, how do we rank up&#160;? We must be top 1&#160;? 
 NewCoder09: yes
 Djellowman: you have to finish higher than the boss
 burnpanck: So if this is a repeat, it's even more disappointing that the the game internals are so inconsistent
 NewCoder09: which is still number 1 Djelloman
 TobiasA: 1 hour 30 min after submit and I am finally in bronze:relieved:
 struct: yeap I lost a bit of motivation after I read that yesterday eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: same for me now
 Westicles: when nobody was beta testing I had a feeling that might happen
 Astrobytes: Very sad state of affairs. At least be upfront about it.
 Wontonimo: well get your motivation back struct!  It's not like Totoro was original 
 Thibauld: couldn't that just be an old poster?
 therealbeef: we don't know if it was a 10 day event or just 1/2 days
 eulerscheZahl: the tweet itself is from 2018
 Astrobytes: Duration is of no consequence really
 Westicles: they probably used it lots of times
 Audatic: what was the name of the original one? I can;t find it
 eulerscheZahl: unleash the geek
 therealbeef: well, in one day you can only scratch the surface; not really a competitive edge
 Audatic: oh 2019 then
 Djellowman: i guess using the builtin IDE becomes a pain the further you get
 eulerscheZahl: no, UTG is a series of multiple contests
 eulerscheZahl: 2018, see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/CodinGame/status/1042790326900023296">https://twitter.com/CodinGame/status/1042790326900023296</a>
 Djellowman: do people at the highest ranks use machine learning? like genetic algorithms etc
 eulerscheZahl: it's not about the possibility of beating that old bots. i have no doubt we can do that
 Astrobytes: therealbeef: it's less about the fact there might be people playing who played before and more a question of honesty and integrity
 struct: it was 1.5 days
 Astrobytes: Again euler :D
 struct: but its not relevant
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Thibauld I looked at the code, it adds a new destination...so i guess it's processed during the next turns gameupdate...which looks like it doesn't set the threat unless it is seen by that baseholder
 Audatic: ah TIL
 orangesnowfox: Djellowman I doubt it currently
 Thibauld: Oh thanks, I mean I have my dudes set to never attack spiders that go for the enemy base, but they'll still follow spiders they just controlled, so I figured that was the case. You're saying the controlled spiders need to be seen by the opponent? That seems really weird.
 Djellowman: is control every worth using..?
 Audatic: yes
 Djellowman: i can see controlling a monster away from your base
 Djellowman: but controlling enemy heroes just takes control away from both players it seems
 mnechromancer: If you manage your mana and control/shield at the right time, you can probably get a pretty big swarm headed right towards the enemy base. I think that's my next strat
 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Thibauld i think you have to draw the lines yourself to see if it may impact reaction to base circle
 Illedan: Damn rushers
 orangesnowfox: mnechromancer someone beat me with that, can confirm it works
 NewCoder09: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Djellowman: 10 mana every tick seems steep
 Thibauld: You only need to do it once
 Thibauld: You basically change their direction
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Djellowman you can drag an enemy hero away from their base to open them up
 Djellowman: ohh... i guess that only works on monsters. that sounds very powerful? you can redirect every monster from your base to theirs
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: It is
 Djellowman: PatrickMcGinnisII but you have to spend 10 mana per tick to drag enemy heroes i think?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Djellowman: what if monsters are targeting your base, will a single control send them to the enemy base
 Illedan: You can deadlock an enemy hero, but it is expensive
 Illedan: Only if that control movement brings the creep outside your base radius
 Djellowman: i see, so you have to drag them out &amp; then you can stop casting it
 Illedan: Yeah, but 1 control = 400 distance. 1 Wind = 2200 distance&#160;;)
 Djellowman: blow them out of your base &amp; control once to direct them to enemy base then perhaps
 ToshiTuringMachine: Hey Hey Hi 
 Astrobytes: hey :wave:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someon did it to me effectively, maybe it was wslavo or Audatic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: drag em behind your hero, then blow them out of base radius
 wlesavo: Illedan 1 shield = 0 distance :slight_smile:
 Maccas: hey hey hey
 ToshiTuringMachine: I want to go silver without using spells
 Illedan: wlesavo, say what
 wlesavo: i think that would be close to impossible
 eulerscheZahl: it's just silver, of course it's possible
 Illedan: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: probably even without spells and stacking all 3 heroes
 ToshiTuringMachine: hey eulerscheZahl how are you?
 eulerscheZahl: toady
 Wontonimo: hoppin' along eh?
 ToshiTuringMachine: don't worry be hoppy
 Scarfield: xD
 wlesavo: euler inory is at 300 with quite advance defense tactics, if the cut off will be around 400 no spells wont make it, simple wind should be enough though 
 wlesavo: oh, is it 800 for bronze usually?
 Illedan: Half the LB
 Illedan: Gotta be dynamic for huge contests&#160;:)
 wlesavo: this one does look simmilar to the last 2 countwise 
 therealbeef: that waters down the bronze boss enough to not need spells
 wlesavo: i remember some contest with bronze starting 400, not sure which one though
 wlesavo: i mean silver
 AlMualem: What is the LB you are reffering to Illedan?
 aCat: lederboard
 Astrobytes: *leaderboard
 AntoninLdn: HOUHOUHOU
 Astrobytes: lederboard is a bit Bavarian sounding
 LittleBlackScorpion: uwu
 quentin_cha: HOUHOUHOUHOUHOUHOU
 AlMualem: haahah
 AntoninLdn: ♥
 AlMualem: so you basically say that those who are above a certain position will automatically get promoted...or i misunderstood it?
 Astrobytes: that's correct. The bot at the cutoff point will become the boss
 Astrobytes: (and be promoted)
 AlMualem: and it is usually about the half?
 Astrobytes: Around that yeah
 jrke: it was near 1500 not sure for last contest which was about 50%
 AlMualem: so now that we 2429 in bronze...about the 1000 first :P
 jrke: butcher is having great hold
 AlMualem: sorry to ask so much...but this was something i didnt know and will get me promoted automatically if it is legit :P
 AlMualem: butcher is out of this league literally and metaforically (i hope i didnt butchered the word)
 JB5: does the game measure distance using manhattan or euclidean (or something else)?
 Audatic: euclidiean 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: return Math.sqrt((v.x - x) * (v.x - x) + (v.y - y) * (v.y - y));
 JB5: thanks!&#160;:)
 Audatic: math.hypot(x1 - x2, y1 - y2) :P
 VaseSimion: I asked this before, but had to leave before getting the answer, does someone know when silver starts_
 Astrobytes: sunday
 VaseSimion: thanks
 Astrobytes: yw
 therealbeef: depends on the timezone&#160;;-)
 wlesavo: if shield and control aplyed at the same turn, will the next turn command be overwritten?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :point_right::cowboy:
 orangesnowfox: nope
 orangesnowfox: &gt; 
 Joe0: can I use a neural net for the spring challenge?
 wlesavo: orangesnowfox the control spell will be casted, but will the effect take place? since it also aplyed on the next turn
 orangesnowfox: ye, it'll still take effect, the protection would prevent a new control from taking effect

 Illedan: Yes
 Illedan: Good luck
 casmith789: you can if you can fit it in the length requirements and train it in time
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Joe0: so i can't get the spring challenge code so I can train fast?
 Joe0: on my own machine
 Illedan: Just code the engine yourself
 wlesavo: Westicles Wind is definetly there, but i didnt see control and shield, hm
 Illedan: The supplied code is in Java
 Joe0: ok
 aCat: so we are given some old contest?
 aCat: this is a joke
 Illedan: Sadly

 jrke: can we get that prev contest link?
 Kyraleese: how long between league promotions?  I've been #1 in Wood 2 for a few minutes now.  Definitely past the boss.
 JulienKerlero: yesterday I waited a few minutes
 dot.nick: i think you have to wait for ongoing battles to finish, and then 1-2 extra minutes
 _NikJ: How's it going, peeps
 Audatic: been place 5 then had a brilliant idea and now I am place 16.
 jrke: Audatic same
 jrke: was 64th
 jrke: added few things now running near 150
 Audatic: and you never know if the things you added were buggy or if it was just a bad idea.
 Audatic: so you try to fix them, hours later you still worse than before xD
 jrke: yeah
 AlMualem: haahahahah Audatic that is so true
 AlMualem: at least we enjoy our "pain"
 mnechromancer: Kind of annoying that we can only test with our base in the top left. I have to debug in the arena because I'm just losing 50% of my games and I don't know what's up
 JulienKerlero: you can cchange the order
 Astrobytes: swap the player positions
 JB5: I was turning on the "fog of war" debug setting, and it doesn't seem to match my euclidean distance calculations.  Should I ignore this or does it mean I'm doing something wrong in my calculations?
 AlMualem: i was testing it without swapping and i did great work protecting the opponetns base :D
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo 06:19PMeuler inory is at 300 with quite advance defense tactics, if the cut off will be around 400 no spells wont make it, 
 eulerscheZahl: he's using wind to defent
 eulerscheZahl: defend
 xdcomrade: are the first given health and mana always relate to my base?
 KalamariKing: yeah
 KalamariKing: the second is always your opponent's
 xdcomrade: thanks!
 mnechromancer: I'm not finding any way to swap player positions, how do?

 madmax7874: how can i know that my hero is in between the base and the monster (to know when to cast spell)
 mnechromancer: Oh wow I had no idea you could test with other players, thank youuu
 VaseSimion: "After a hero's move phase, any monsters within 800 units will suffer 2 points of damage."
 KalamariKing: madmax7874 thats one of the challenges, figuring those kind of things out
 wlesavo: euler that was my point, that spells will be needed for silver, but again, depend on the cut off
 JB5: fyi: I resolved my question about the fog of war debug setting, I was calculating incorrectly
 Thibauld: In half my battles I just end up playing spider-ping pong
 madmax7874: KalamariKing okay, was just stuck at that so thought of asking
 orangesnowfox: spider ping pong lmao

 orangesnowfox: Not until sunday
 ganbat24: okay good
 orangesnowfox: How do cutoffs work for leagues?
 ganbat24: tonight after dinner i will code using wind and other spells with fog
 struct: didnt know I could push so much
 struct: frame 83
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622021681">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622021681</a>
 Scarfield: heroes move, then swing according to distances, then monsters move?
 VaseSimion: That is 3 winds in the same time
 orangesnowfox: struct yeah, wind *adds*
 Scarfield: the technical details and action order doesnt describe the same order
 struct: yeah
 Thibauld: yeet
 ganbat24: they push then use wind to bombard u with minions(monsters)
 VaseSimion: I coded my bot wrong and did that a few times, that looks like  a pretty tough attacj
 struct: so if I triple wind opponent base its impossible to defend?
 VaseSimion: they can wind also
 ganbat24: yes
 ganbat24: but they wont know when the wind is coming
 Thibauld: But they'd have to see it coming, no?
 struct: they cant defend if the minions are far enough
 ganbat24: yeah so if you have 3 sets of spiders in the distance they can almost insta wind
 ganbat24: but u need to be precise or u can counter wind the next frame
 Scarfield: btw struct did you reply "yeah" to my "heroes move, then swing according to distances, then monsters move?" question, or another message?
 jacek: yeah
 KalamariKing: yeah
 KalamariKing: codingame does NOT have tf and/or pytorch support iirc, right?
 ganbat24: aight off to dinner 
 Scarfield: After an entity moves towards a point, .. only then are distance-based calculations performed (such as monster damage).
 jacek: KalamariKing no
 Scarfield: from tech details, not that clear&#160;:(
 KalamariKing: alright ty
 jacek: no need for NNs. no one on CG uses NNs ever :v
 KalamariKing: :skull: interesting
 MaestroDePiton: todas putas
 jacek: oO
 Waffle3z: #1 in oware and UTTT are nn right?
 Waffle3z: probably more than just the first one
 jacek: oware probably top 10 is NN
 jacek: except msmits
 KalamariKing: yeah thats what I had thought
 Astrobytes: more than 10 now I think
 struct: no Scarfield
 struct: But maybe someone already answeredd it
 struct: MOVE all heroes.Heroes attack monsters in range and produce mana for each hit.
 struct: thats 4 and 5
 Scarfield: Technical Details
 Scarfield: made me unsure, but thanks&#160;:)
 struct: when i wind a minion in attack range
 struct: it still takes damage right?
 jacek: why do you read the statements instead of blindly ask the chat? :c
 struct: because its confusing
 eulerscheZahl: wow, i did a tie on wild mana<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/622032333">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/622032333</a>
 orangesnowfox: daaang
 Scarfield: thats a lot of mana that you are not using :p
 eulerscheZahl: not implemented yet
 eulerscheZahl: still not sure how to play the game. how much simulation, how much heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: and what i want to achieve. compete for the top or just reach legend and call it a day
 eulerscheZahl: my motivation dropped, now that i know it's a contest out of the can
 Scarfield: same, the time is short and the search space enormous
 eulerscheZahl: i do a little bit of search already, can't be bothered with geometry to find spots that attack multiple spiders
 struct: Just do like code vs zombies
 eulerscheZahl: that one has no opponent
 Scarfield: i havent seen anyone shield opponent heroes to be able to blast monsters behind them yet
 orangesnowfox: Error 404: rank not found
 struct: Thats what you will soon see when you open my profile
 orangesnowfox: ah, not top 50
 Scarfield: oh no not again xD
 Joe0: hey I just got promoted to bronze league, but my code isn't ready for the added complexity and I barely made it out of wood (im pretty new to this). Can I go back to wood for testing?
 struct: nope
 orangesnowfox: nope!
 struct: you are ready
 Joe0: i got promoted at number 39
 Astrobytes: better than the boss == promoted
 Joe0: ok
 Joe0: thx
 Astrobytes: don't worry about what rank you were just focus on improving now
 Joe0: k
 jmelis: dw, if you dont get it now then you are right on track to learn something
 WannaBeHum1n: an enemy hero camping ur base pushing and shielding mobs closer faster is pure evil
 WannaBeHum1n: like
 WannaBeHum1n: daym
 orangesnowfox: that's when you control the hero
 orangesnowfox: and if the hero is shielded, you wind the mobs on the same turn to cancel the effect :p
 Scarfield: if 2 heroes control a monster in exactly opposite directions, the monster will stay in place?
 AlexAnselmo: Wind the spiders toward their hero, make him work for you.
 orangesnowfox: Scarfield, yep!
 WannaBeHum1n: @AlexAnseimo what do u mean make him work 4 u
 WannaBeHum1n: i didnt get the idea
 orangesnowfox: "make the hero kill the mobs for you"
 WannaBeHum1n: ahhh ok 
 orangesnowfox: honestly, I've heard that a few times, and there's a problem inthat their hero gets wildmana
 Scarfield: i wonder if the monster will get a random direction after that then, ot stay stationary
 WannaBeHum1n: can i test my code in  previous league xDDDDDDD
 WannaBeHum1n: pls
 orangesnowfox: random
 orangesnowfox: it's in the ref
 orangesnowfox: more likely is a player controlling the mob inplace
 orangesnowfox: to just... freeze all the mobs lol
 Scarfield: ok ty, i suck at reading others codes. have tried using refs before, its easier for me to just do the sim from scratch, and ask chat for "edge cases" etc
 KelvinAndHubbles: Any tutorials on how to setup cg brutaltester?
 DaNinja: 2 mana per hit
 Scarfield: chat scroll :thinking:
 coder_AA: vbtrer
 ganbat24: if to opposing players kill a minion at the same time who gets the mana?
 DaNinja: both
 ganbat24: damn
 ganbat24: nice
 Thibauld: You get mana for damage,not kills
 ganbat24: oh yeah
 ganbat24: i was thinking of kill stealing but thats not a problem ig
 Thibauld: Well, I
 Thibauld: 've seen people try to send their hero to my side early and try to steal some spider kills
 Thibauld: Just so there is less for my hero to hit
 Thibauld: but that seems like a double-edged sword
 Thibauld: You also spend more time walking and doing nothing
 wlesavo: it goes there not to steel kills, its just preventively sent diversant
 Eltrion: Might be scouting and recording your position too
 Thibauld: For sure those and a lot more could be, but I definitely saw them attack "my" spiders :p Which means fewer hits for my heroes and more walking
 nightwalkerinthedark: quagmire
 Eltrion: I'm working on code for a hero that will steal kills most of the time, but it will detect if you over extend, and punt in spiders with wind.
 Eltrion: I think that vision's gonna become real important at the higher leauges
 orangesnowfox: stealing kills isn't really all that important, there's no last-hit bonus or anything
 orangesnowfox: wildmana is damage based
 jmelis: am i tripping or is the mana that comes in not correct? i have 344 mana and console is logging 12
 jmelis: assuming im tripping but anyone had this problem too?
 Yanek: maybe it's your opponent's mana
 iTsluku: print the mana given inside the gameloop, that should be correct
 Scarfield: you get both players mana, do you keep them separately?
 jmelis: ahhh i see, thank you guys ^^ 
 jmelis: was indeed enemy mana
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 jacek: manafield
 Scarfield: jacex
 Skadush: hi
 TobiasA: I've never been so disrespected:sob:.Some guys bot just walked up right to the front of my base and yeeted 3 monsters in there. I felt all my effort go down the drain
 NapTown: :joy:
 mybk: interesting, can share a replay&#160;? :p 
 mybk: can you *
 TobiasA: lemme see if i can find it
 mybk: thank you 
 TobiasA: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/622091030">https://www.codingame.com/replay/622091030</a>
 TobiasA: :sob:
 IvesL: lmao
 IvesL: why is it pushed so far
 Scarfield: lol thats a yolo strat
 IvesL: stacked?
 Scarfield: yup
 Scarfield: each wind adds together
 IvesL: i have to play this
 IvesL: lmao
 ganbat24: Your mana finance is....
 Scarfield: 90 mana and you can kill with this strat, if opponent doesnt counter in time
 TobiasA: such strategies are a menace to both society and my sanity
 IvesL: he can do this earlier isnt it
 mybk: waw
 ganbat24: all spells cost 10?
 ganbat24: thats op
 TobiasA: how does one even counter that
 Disruption: crying and curling up into a ball mostly
 Scarfield: control, shield, wind
 Disruption: my strategy works even with 0 mana tho :P 
 IvesL: calculate their heroes distance, see if stack together or close enough to your base
 Scarfield: dont let the opponent in a situation where they can just yeet
 mybk: wind probably, but that means that you need a hero to stand in center of your base all the time&#160;? 
 ganbat24: also u used 3 winds to push away in the beginning
 IvesL: but this is certainly fab idea
 TobiasA: yea if one is to defend that kind of strat they'll have to rush to their base
 TobiasA: which will in turn disrupt the mana mining:sob:
 mybk: recurse gonna play in this event&#160;? 
 mybk: I am curious to what his NN will do this time
 Scarfield: we will only know near the end, but i doubt it actually, i think he is tired of CG
 eulerscheZahl: i have doubts that NNs are viable here
 eulerscheZahl: and he hears about the Amadeus contest, he will just rant and quit
 aCat: but he had 4 years to train his NN ^^'
 inoryy: if anyone manages to do an NN based bot and get it to legend by end of contest PM me for a referral
 eulerscheZahl: if he*
 pmor: I think this is a good contest.  I'm regretting letting it be known that it was used before
 Scarfield: even if this is a reused contest, its still new to us, and seems an interesting game. It might be the last bot contest for years, so I say enjoy it&#160;:)
 inoryy: wait what, reused contest?
 aCat: yep
 Scarfield: better get it out early tbh, its still a new game for us, even though its a low effort from CG
 aCat: CG gives a shit and throw us some old stuff after a year
 antiwonto: [auto] aCat be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 pmor: It was a private company hackathon
 aCat: oh I watch my language
 aCat: you should hear what I really have to say
 aCat: (talking to auto bot message)
 Scarfield: i get the frustration, but that doesnt necessarily have to take the joy of the (maybe last real) bot contest now is my pov
 AlMualem: has anything been heard about stopping bot contests?
 jacek: no one knew about it before, its still somewhat new
 aCat: apart from CG slacking off? I hope not
 aCat: They pretend its a big event yes?
 inoryy: I guess reusing private contest is not a bad thing in itself though it might imply potentially less interest in creating future contests, that might be a bummer
 pmor: It could have been used as a way to vet a contest
 aCat: c'mon we could reuse if 5 contests per year, not grand new event after A YEAR, 
 pmor: I think there are some minor differences, and we didn't have the referee source
 Westicles: nobody new about it?  except 147 teams, 441 players at 17 sites worldwide
 AlMualem: I just see it as an opportunity to sharpen my problem solving skills with programming and nothing more...not here to win not here to compete...i am here to learn...
 a-Rye: Still, reused or not, the point of CG is to help you get a job. If you can pull off a bot, you explain your bot in an interview, and bam, you get a job. I've gotten job offers just by explaining basic encryption algorithms. Much less complicated than programming a bot lol
 AlMualem: yes CG could find something never used before but ok....
 AlMualem: its fine by me as long i am getting better :D
 a-Rye: *dusts off bifocals* Back in my day, if you wanted experience programming a game bot, you had to spend $40,000 - $60,000 on a university degree. :joy:
 pmor: When I did it before, it was real fun seeing strategies evolve day after day.  And strategies have advandatages and disadvatges
 ganbat24: so heroes ids are 0 1 2 3 4 5 is it guaranteed mine is 0 1 2
 ganbat24:&#160;?
 LukerSmasher: noo
 pmor: I think this contest is not going to be who can code the most optimized simulation search
 pmor: it'll be who can come up with heuristics that can adapt
 Nerchio: ok who can give me tips who to calculate intercept of 2 circles
 ganbat24: it is possible to keep controlling ur enemy to be at spawn
 Scarfield: dist between position less then radius + radius
 Westicles: oh, I have a clash for that!  touching balls
 Nerchio: I mean that's intersect not intercept :D
 Scarfield: oh nvm&#160;:)
 TJSteel: circles are easy to determin if they're overlapping, if the distance between the centers of each is smaller than the radius of both added together then they intersect
 TJSteel: or are you trying to calculate more than that?
 Nerchio: intercept not intersect
 TJSteel: not exactly sure what you mean
 a-Rye: wouldn't that be when the midpoints are equal?
 a-Rye: or centers I guess would be a better term
 Nerchio: instead of just targeting the center of the spider you target some point on his path that is the most optimal 
 jrke: they decreased total no of battles ig
 TJSteel: oh I get you, well they travel in straight lines so that makes it easier
 a-Rye: ah, predicting where the monster will be. That sounds like some trig calculating hypotenuse to where they'll be
 Nerchio: exactly
 Nerchio: so who can teach me this
 jacek: -3vel
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Nerchio looking for some intro tutorials on programming?  This isn't the place probably.  Try codecademy.com , 'The Coding Train' on youtube, or first levels in codewars.com
 Nerchio: internet doesnt help
 Nerchio: thanks bot
 TJSteel: I've code for that somewhere from doing targetting for robocode
 Scarfield: hmm if intersect, then "draw" line between points, "draw" perpendicular line at radius dist from one point, find point on perpendicular line thats radius dist away from point
 a-Rye: Try plugging in different target points and calculate distance by finding hypotenuse. A**2 + B**2 = C**2
 PatrickMcGinnisII: midpoint of two centers, draw right angle line...the intercepts ...ok what he said
 TJSteel: aiming a bullet for where the target is going to be
 Nerchio: its not perpendicular scarfield
 TJSteel: I'll try find it, one min
 a-Rye: You're finding the third point after knowing your location and spider's location
 Nerchio: TJSteel yeah but here we also have radius right not just pixel points
 TJSteel: yes but if you're aiming at the monster then I'd say aiming at where it's center is would be a good start
 inoryy: Nerchio look into CSB materials
 a-Rye: also, you know how fast the spiders travel. So, you can have a better guess as to where they'll be after so many moves
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you have a bunch of mobs within 800 of each other...just average  the centers
 Nerchio: TJSteel Well I want to write the solution to the problem not half-solution
 TJSteel: then if you want to adjust for it's radius, to aim further in front / behind you just move it's coordinate forward / backwards
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well ref gives vx,vy
 Nerchio: and I don't like geometry or whatever its called 
 Nerchio: so thats a problem
 jmelis: what does vx, vy point at? seems to me its inconsistent with the directory the spiders are moving
 ganbat24: it points relative to spider position
 struct: isnt where it will go next?
 ganbat24: vx &amp; vy: monster's current speed vector, they will add this to their position for their next
 struct: yeah
 jrke: butcher having strongest hold i have ever seen in a contest
 TimberStalker: Its a velocity, why would it be the point where it goes next
 jmelis: ahh that makes much more sense, thx
 ganbat24: yeah they will go to {x+vx, y+vy} nexy
 Westicles: bit runner all over again
 PatrickMcGinnisII: each wind should blow off a spider leg er something spd&gt;&gt;=1
 TJSteel: @Nerchio, take a look at this section: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/TJSteel/Robocode/blob/master/Robocode/src/jaysRobot/JaysRobot.java#L199">https://github.com/TJSteel/Robocode/blob/master/Robocode/src/jaysRobot/JaysRobot.java#L199</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no slippery bits
 TJSteel: and also this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/TJSteel/Robocode/blob/2a63bd6fd34f8124d16e6c44386cfaea33e251cc/Robocode/src/jaysRobot/EnemyBot.java#L65">https://github.com/TJSteel/Robocode/blob/2a63bd6fd34f8124d16e6c44386cfaea33e251cc/Robocode/src/jaysRobot/EnemyBot.java#L65</a>
 SirLoxley: Is the Wood #1 boss this time poorly chosen? I got promoted without any extra effort&#160;:/
 ganbat24: fog of war is so annoying istg i dont like not perfect information games
 TJSteel: this should give you an idea of how to accurately predict where something is going to be given it's trajectory and speed
 TJSteel: the math may not perfectly translate to this challenge due to the coordinates being different, but it should give a good enough idea
 Nerchio: I mean I know where it will be, just add vx and vy, but finding optimal intercepting vector is another thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fog kinda removes the chess style sims
 TJSteel: this calculates based on the speed of something
 orangesnowfox: random intercepting fact: you move *then* you deal damage *then* the mob moves
 struct: just email MSmits he will teach you the physics 
 inoryy: or look at CSB
 orangesnowfox: Which means that "where will the mob be at the end of the turn" isn't quite... Where you want to be
 struct: Just dont forget to update vx and vy once the spider enters a base range
 TJSteel: this one was to hit a moving target with a bullet from a tank in robocode, you could use the same logic here but instead of bullet speed you'd use player speed, then it'd give you the location it will be at providing you travel directly to that location
 IvesL: woods are meant to be tutorial
 VaseSimion: @orangesnowfox: Thanks for that info, I missed that completely
 ganbat24: failed a CONTROL: Hero 2 doesn't know where entity 5 is
 ganbat24: bruh
 jrke: entity 5 should be under control range of hero 2 ig
 ganbat24: oh yeah
 ganbat24: i see
 Girard: hi friends
 TobiasA: i seem to be running out of ideas
 IvesL: why dont you yeet back to the one who yeeted you
 TobiasA: i don't want to be that guy
 TobiasA: that's seems too straight forward for my liking
 IvesL: if thats too straight forward
 IvesL: how about stock up 3 and yeet at once
 PatrickMcGinnisII: here TobiasA

 TobiasA: how the hell am I supposed to teach my bot to herd spiders
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i use 0 spells, and you drain your bag
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how about turnbased stratagem?  like what is the point of winding before turn 83 unless you are in a clutch
 PatrickMcGinnisII: replay should never have gotten to 220 turns
 TobiasA: why
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you drain your mana, when i can easily kill mobs with &lt; hp
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mob hp increases as turns go by
 PatrickMcGinnisII: when spawned
 IvesL: that means eventually you still need units to distract
 PatrickMcGinnisII: u wind mobs that are headed off the board... waste
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wind only threats to enemy base if you have to i guess.  there u go, an idea
 wlesavo: simulate everything, here is an idea :slight_smile:
 TobiasA: simulate then what
 ddreams: then win, of course
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I never run out of ideas, just chair time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf, life calls
 yhyoxx: word

 DjTrilogic: why my local environment doen't render the fog please&#160;?
 DjTrilogic: (i forked the github refree)
 orangesnowfox: its a setting
 orangesnowfox: uh, not sure how the overlay works
 DjTrilogic: it seems to be related with the Canvas's renderer
 okon1230: :grinning:
 jacek: :upside_down:
 TobiasA: when you guys make sims for CG bots do you simulate every single mechanic of the game?
 renaxdev: Hi, I have a problem. I want to play coc but when I start a clash, i cant get to the screen where i can write the code. instead there is a counter which is saying Clash has been started since: 02:13how can i fix that?
 orangesnowfox: TobiasA: everything that's possible to simulate yeah, the more accurate the sim the more accurate the results (garbage in garbage out)
 Astrobytes: play the contest instead [solved]
 TobiasA: thanks
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 jacek: well for some games or for starters you dont need to simulate everything. in csb you could omit collisions and still get decent results
 struct: you probably can get top 300 with no collisions on csb
 Astrobytes: I think even higher, or used to be
 wlesavo: no collisions is the only bad thing about this contests  :smiley:
 struct: But there are
 wlesavo: i mean the current one
 orangesnowfox: honestly, no collisions for once is kinda nice
 struct: cant spiders collide with the wall?
 orangesnowfox: so can heroes!
 struct: if its in base range
 rwilson: no colliding, but they can't be blown off while in your base area
 wlesavo: that does not count :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: it's technically a collision :P
 struct: dont you have to calculate it?
 wlesavo: imagine body blocking spiders :smiley:
 rwilson: it's a collision that can be modelled by a static rule &amp; thus nearly ignored.
 struct: whats the rule?
 struct: Maybe im overthinking
 Astrobytes: that would not be like you at all struct&#160;;)
 ddreams: not really a collision, it's a limit or boundary that applies there
 rwilson:&#160;;) we could all argue it rather successfully both ways... 
 Astrobytes: indeed
 jacek: eeyup
 ddreams: at least there's no collision detection&#160;:)
 okon1230:&#160;:)
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/1usfkqB.png">https://i.imgur.com/1usfkqB.png</a>
 struct: but here in this example
 struct: on black line it would collide right?
 struct: imagine I just used wind on that direction
 rwilson: @struct - yes / no -   programmers implementation of it likely 'colors' their view of if it's a collision or not.. 
 iTsluku: am i the only one who likes to test heuristics with like 500LOC full of spaghetti mess? :D
 Astrobytes: Isn't that the definition of a reflex bot in a contest?
 rwilson: :spaghetti:
 iTsluku: elaborate on reflex bot pls
 TobiasA: what's LOC
 iTsluku: lines of code
 ddreams: @struct in the game code it checks whether the entity ends up outside of the bounds, and if so intersects with the base boundary
 Astrobytes: reflex agent, reacts to it's surroundings/environment without thinking ahead
 Astrobytes: hence 'reflex'
 jacek: instinct?
 struct: so I check new with old position and then check if that line crossed the base walls?
 iTsluku: hm what would be a feature worth implementing a lookahead?
 Astrobytes: you could try to simulate the effects of various actions, movements...
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/c481d8fcaafbba9e4dbf767ee4d0b4040d088938/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L360">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/c481d8fcaafbba9e4dbf767ee4d0b4040d088938/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L360</a>
 ddreams: here's the base wall intersection code
 struct: ty
 ytaya: how can i make report&#160;? a man in sourth mode of clash he encrypt his code like this exec(bytes('ⱸ㵹灯湥〨㬩㵹⩛慭⡰湩ⱴ⹹灳楬⡴⤩㭝牰湩⡴慭⡸⥹洭湩礨⤩','u16')[2:])

 TobiasA: lol
 struct: Maybe I can use my fantastic bits code for this
 Astrobytes: antiwont o to the rescue
 struct: the wall collision should be similar

 SirLoxley: Can I SHIELD and CONTROL a monster in the same turn?
 LaurensD: Nope I don't think you can execute multiple spells at the same time in a turn
 LaurensD: unless you are using two hero's
 Astrobytes: Yes, I think orangesnowfox was talking about this earlier
 rwilson: @SirLoxley i think you'd have to CONTROL with one, then SHIELD with a second ( and order matters , or the control wouldn't work )
 SirLoxley: Well, the order says CONTROL, then SHIELD
 _NikJ: Can't see why not SirLoxley
 SirLoxley: so in theory if I take a big bad monster from the corner and turn it towards the enemy base ... SHIELD/CONTROL turns it into a nuke
 orangesnowfox: what about me and talking about stuff?
 Astrobytes: CONTROL and SHIELD on the same turn against the same monster, I was sure I saw you talking bout that earlier
 Astrobytes: possibly with wlesavo
 iTsluku: wut
 Astrobytes: I'll ping jacek for fun just in case

 iTsluku: both dont work for me
 Astrobytes: iTsluku: that bot uses a couple of variables and ignores everything else, I should hope it is beatable
 Don_Nicolas: a
 rwilson: ;TLDR - Shield Control same turn - legit
 Astrobytes: did I tag the right people?
 iTsluku: wtf as if u can do 2 actions in one turn?
 Astrobytes: I won't read those pastebins rn
 _NikJ: well it's 2 separate actions by 2 separate heroes, right?
 _NikJ: shouldn't be a problem
 iTsluku: ah 2 heroes&#160;;)
 iTsluku: i only have 1 aggro hero
 _NikJ: I'm just guessing, I'm using a stupid 100 line for/if combo and only using Wind 
 _NikJ: Considering I reached top 100 atm, I'm happy with this, might not even bother with others :D 
 iTsluku: actually 1 defender would be enough i guess since most is resolved by wind anyway?
 iTsluku: hm
 ddreams: there's finite mana
 iTsluku: yeh but then 2 could farm alot more in the middle
 ddreams: also your opponent will come and shield them
 iTsluku: most of the time my opp will WIND close monsters and then i SHIELD them ... the moment they run away hahahaha
 MaestroDePiton: nice coc
 ddreams: said the bride
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: where is jacek with his "that's what she said" comments
 jacek: im more mature than that
 struct: jacek are you participating on the contest?
 jacek: well im in bronze with my if bot
 jacek: but dunno if something more than that
 Audatic: I only do if/else and I am rank 12 atm&#160;:) 
 struct: o.o
 struct: Maybe I need to add else
 struct: instead of only ifs
 Astrobytes: I find it rather tedious, never liked codebusters, but I'll play it just because it's here
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 Audatic: yeah I also do some elifs, can recommend&#160;;)
 _NikJ: well that's cheating, elif doesn't exist in c++
 Astrobytes: :P
 _NikJ: you have an unfair advantage using python
 jacek: thats what she said!
 Audatic: the good thing about using only if/else is that you can do Python without running out of time :P 
 Astrobytes: jacek :rofl:
 struct: This is why I cant do anything
 struct: I never use ifs
 Astrobytes: If/else is The True AI remember
 Astrobytes: where is ceg, we need some prune arrays
 _NikJ: If windows troubleshooter can be an empty block {;}, then my AI can be ifs
 cegprakash: huh
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 Astrobytes: hello cegprakash :D
 cegprakash: did somebody say cegprakash
 cegprakash: I'm just watching Psyho's stream
 Astrobytes: nice to see you dude
 Astrobytes: is he using prune arrays?
 MaestroDePiton: nice coc
 Don_Nicolas: nice
 Slidax: nice
 MaestroDePiton:  n word
 struct: Dont spam
 Astrobytes: ^ ahem
 MaestroDePiton: sry mr struct
 Don_Nicolas: Sorry
 Slidax: Sorry
 struct: Im sorry too
 Don_Nicolas: 🅱️ased
 WannaBeHum1n: sorry
 DomiKo: are you sorry?
 Astrobytes: I am DomiKo
 DomiKo: ohhh you are, sorry
 Astrobytes: But I'm not sorry I'm not a mod anymore :D
 DomiKo: :joy:
 DomiKo: struct staying strong :muscle:
 cegprakash: I forgot when I used prune arrays
 Astrobytes: has aCat calmed down yet?
 struct: Its fine DomiKo
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: I forgot too, it was when I taught you some stuff about alphabeta but I cannot remember the multi
 DomiKo: Astro I don't think so
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: wait - it was Oware right
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: understandable
 jacek: oO
 cegprakash: let me check
 cegprakash: yeah I've alpha beta on oware
 Astrobytes: it was defo Oware
 Astrobytes: was a funny convo
 Astrobytes: got there in the end though right&#160;;)
 cegprakash: yeah I'm 2 ranks behind euler
 cegprakash: so it's good
 struct: so we are all close to the same rank
 Scarfield: i dont think a cat has calmed down no, he seemed way too upset. i mean i get that it seems like low effort from CG. BUT we get all this for free, its a game almost none of us has seen before, and being upset about it is expecting too much imo
 cegprakash: why was he upset
 jacek: calmfield
 cegprakash: what's his problem
 Astrobytes: To be fair, in a Cats case I kinda understand
 Scarfield: the contest is an ealier hackatron from 2018
 pmor: I regret even saying anything now
 cegprakash: that's ok
 pmor: And it wasn't 2018, it was a private company hackathon from 2020
 Scarfield: you shouldnt pmor, it would get out somehow. the ealier the better imo&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: he's used CG as a reliable backbone for his coursework and even they know that
 struct: so it was reused more than once :p
 cegprakash: as long as it's private who cares -_- we get a nice contest
 pedrosorio: @pmor someone shared a tweet from 2018 with screenshots that looked like this game
 pmor: I really liked this competition then, and I think its a great competition in this case
 pmor: ah, wasn't aware of that
 Astrobytes: pmor: honestly, don't worry about it at all
 Scarfield: ^
 cegprakash: as if we gonna win t shirts
 cegprakash: we all know I ain't gonna win a t shirt
 cegprakash: why should I be upset
 cegprakash: :D
 Astrobytes: cegprakash awww have some faith!
 Scarfield: astrobytes how  does that explain cats case better?
 Scarfield: lol ceg&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: he's busted his ass a lot for CG stuff
 antiwonto: [auto] Astrobytes be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 jacek: oO
 Scarfield: ah makes sense
 Astrobytes: aw wheesht antiwonto
 Scarfield: thought you meant the other way around
 cegprakash: antiwonto good job
 Astrobytes: balls
 Astrobytes: still gone :D
 Scarfield: as in cat used CG's stuff for his courses, not contributing to it
 Astrobytes: nono, the complete opposite
 Scarfield: scrathing ma balls is fine
 Scarfield: but sitting on my ass is bad
 antiwonto: [auto] Scarfield be respectful and watch your language<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: ill buy that cat has a good reason to be mad then. But honestly i hope that this contest will recieve more possitive feedback from us than a backlash because its not entirely new. If CG gets bad feedback because of a mostly unseen contest game, why would they ever want to make any new ones anyway
 jetenergy: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if it is good for that
 Astrobytes: I'm just happy there actually IS a contest so whilst I'm not happy about them not being upfront about it, I am happy to compete and see a load of familiar faces again
 Astrobytes: I have a funny feeling we won't be seeing many more
 Scarfield: yea same, did they sell it as a new one, or did we just assume?
 MoMaT: why is this not "entirely new"?
 pmor: It's new for almost everyone competing.  So what if it has been vetted by a handful
 Astrobytes: Not explicitly, but it's indeed assumed as they usually are, except in the case of the crystal mining UTG one
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/AmadeusNice/status/1042783736713105408">https://twitter.com/AmadeusNice/status/1042783736713105408</a>
 Astrobytes: The crystal mining one which was discovered by accident that is
 pmor: ah, interesting Scarfield
 Astrobytes: by BenjaminUrqhart
 Scarfield: my thoughts as well pmor. we have just become acoustomed to having new contest games
 Astrobytes: I  feel I forgot a u there
 pmor: When we did this, it was fun to watch the strategies evolve day after day. 
 MoMaT: I see, it was made for a company event run before.
 Astrobytes: I thiiiink it's more to do with how it fits in to the direction of CG currently in all honesty, as opposed to a direct opposition to reusing content
 pmor: And what works for one strategy won't work for another
 DomiKo: We could say, they were alpha testers
 Astrobytes: yes, it's a very open playing field pmor
 Scarfield: sure astro, but thats not an issue of the contest itself imo
 pmor: Plus I don't think it'll come down to who can code the most optimized search
 Astrobytes: no it's more a community issue 
 pmor: Heuristic bots will have a very strong showing.
 Astrobytes: yes pmor, it's impossible to sim everything, so allows for some creativity
 wlesavo: but you still will have to sim some parts of the battle
 ddreams: Also not easily applicable for recurse's NN, afaict
 Scarfield: yup my thoughts excactly astro
 Astrobytes: still a 'thing' though Scarfield, community feels neglected etc
 pmor: Yup. There's some opportunity to sim, but I strategy and tactics matter more
 Scarfield: sure, but we should have more focus on that, than the contest being the issue in and of itself me thinks
 Astrobytes: ddreams: he's not the only person with NNs here :D
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I feel there will be discussion after the contest about this :D
 ddreams: I believe that, especially since the previous bot contest
 ddreams: s/since/after
 Astrobytes: many multis  have NNs at the top
 Astrobytes: nowadays
 Astrobytes: pretty cool tbh
 ddreams: Yeah, if I had time I'd try to replicate it too
 ddreams: interesting stuff
 Scarfield: there will be for sure, my worry is just that the focus will be on the contest not being new, more than our worries for future changes. If i where CG and there would be a bad reception of this contest, i would probably think; why bother, there is no satisfying these guys
 Astrobytes: I like to think people would be pragmatic in their wording regarding the situation
 Scarfield: hopefully&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: But I have a feeling there won't be any more anyway
 ddreams: thousands of people are seemingly enjoying it though
 Astrobytes: They just don't have the resources to cater for us now
 SirLoxley: we had a private cg for our company, too - honestly I am expecting it to be in a public contest one day, given that there's a considerable distance between the two events.
 Scarfield: yup same, thats also why its sad to see some of the top regulars being so expressive about being disappointed
 Astrobytes: Only 1 person looking after 'free CG' stuff etc
 SirLoxley: Unless the contract with CG said that they cannot reuse it ... why shouldn't they? And why would this be considered cheap content?
 Astrobytes: It's understandable though imo, I can taste the salt
 Westicles: If they sold it once they probably sold it hundreds of times.  They have a small bag of these things to sell 
 SirLoxley: So what. Everyone does that
 Scarfield: yea its not that i dont get it, its just being blown out of proportion by a few "prominent" user imo. which spreads 
 Westicles: That's why you see clumps of the same companies and schools on the top of the leaderboard
 SirLoxley: I suppose developing such a game isn't exactly easy nor cheap
 Astrobytes: SirLoxley: oftentimes the contracts do specify exclusivity, we somehow managed to convince Amadeus and CG to release the Crystal Mining UTG game :D After a long legal process
 Astrobytes: well, not us, but lawyers ofc :D
 Astrobytes: SirLoxley: 100%
 Scarfield: Robin Hood true
 Astrobytes: heheh
 SirLoxley: It's not the exact same game we saw in house, though. Some parts of the rules got changed
 Hjax: is the game runner broken 
 llllllllll: yep
 RockyMullet: F
 Fanfouer: When will the next challenge league open?
 llllllllll: :fire: = servers
 Scarfield: a wild mullet apears
 Astrobytes: A wild RockyMullet appears
 Scarfield: xD
 Michel_V.: @Fanfouer silver will unlock on monday
 Astrobytes: curse you MulletField!
 Astrobytes: Michel_V. Sunday
 Fanfouer: Thanks&#160;!
 Michel_V.: i stand corrected
 Scarfield: well depending on time zone
 Ch3oul: hello, anyone know what's this error: 
 sergod: yep
 Astrobytes: I think it will still be sunday for most regardless, can't remember the time
 dbf: Ch3oul, the same for me. 
 Poviliukas: same here
 dbf: can't run any game
 steph.paso: same
 Ch3oul:&#160;:/
 Scarfield: poor servers
 Poviliukas: time to sleep&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: means the server is still executing your previous code
 Astrobytes: == server issues
 Ch3oul: seems like the excutor is stuck in another session 
 llllllllll: same. and also server error 504 and some other codes
 Astrobytes: yes
 Ch3oul: yeah
 Michel_V.: you can delete your enemy and choose it again, that should cancel your session and fix the error
 Westicles: I thought they'd have more servers now with coderpants
 Scarfield: hows your code Astrobytes? im still not sure if im gonna try going the sim and search way. have some ideas for pruning but damn this search space
 Astrobytes: please do report on discord so they can fix or fix in the morning (EU time)
 sergod: It is fixed now
 llllllllll: true, I could play my code
 jacek: monday morning?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I barely read any info, and sort one or two vectors according to some heuristics
 Ch3oul: fixed 
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: I do have a better framework written to use tomorrow though
 Astrobytes: I think there will be some value in simulating at least a couple of actions 
 ddreams: doubt I'll sim anything this time
 Scarfield: yea im considering some "phases" and strategies, and them siming within some parameters from that. i doubt a full sim in itself will do well. but i think i will try smitsi just to see
 SirLoxley: huh. I didn't see that you can Control heroes and/or Shield them.
 ddreams: not going to have enough time to have a chance at the top 10 anyway
 Scarfield: i just lack the time
 pmor: SirLoxley its expensive, but you can lock down a hero for a period of time
 Astrobytes: I don't think there's much value in a completely sim-based approach but I might be wrong
 Scarfield: my feeling as well, the search space is slightly enormous
 Scarfield: "almost infinite" :p
 burnpanck: just completing my C++ sim; though not yet sure I can use it for anything more than rapid searching of parameters of heuristic strategies
 ddreams: "slightly enormous" :P
 Scarfield: :smirk::
 Westicles: you can sim the one guy you send into the enemy corner
 Tiramon: shielded units can still be pushed by wind?
 ProAnonymous: Hi, how to use angle in Gold League of pods? please anyone?
 struct: no
 Scarfield: The target entity cannot be targeted by spells for the next 12 rounds. 
 SirLoxley: the shield is only active the next turn
 struct: but shield only applies next turn
 Tiramon: hm nice to know
 Astrobytes: burnpanck: yes that's a good use for it
 ProAnonymous: Guys, any thought on that?The provided angle is absolute. 0° means facing EAST while 90° means facing SOUTH.
 burnpanck: one way to significantly reduce the search space is to only consider moving directly towards entities; potentially consider not switching the targeted entity until something "significant" happens (e.g. the mob is destroyed)
 ddreams: @ProAnonymous be more specific with your question... my immediate thought is only "Go WEST, life is peaceful there"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ProAnonymous if angle of your desired destination is too different, then maybe lower the speed?
 Scarfield: there are plenty of ways to prune/reduce, but the problem is finding a way that also makes your search do well
 Astrobytes: definitely burnpanck, not gonna help with countering from the enemy much though. 
 burnpanck: Astrobytes yes, especially because of fog of war siming the opponent is difficult
 Astrobytes: absolutely
 ddreams: @burnpanck I think the main enemy hero to sim is the one people send up to attack the base
 ddreams: seems to be visible most of the time
 ddreams: not sure how much value you'll get though
 Astrobytes: probably not even needed to actually sim its potential actions, assume the worst and sim your possible counters
 Scarfield: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: it's an interesting one
 Scarfield: thats probably a goof approach
 Scarfield: good* xD
 ProAnonymous: PatrickMcGinnisII i'm at gold league, they changed the meaning of the angle input param. In the beginning, it was angle between your pod and the target checkpoint, now it's absolute angle means angle between your pod and OX. so i don't see any way how to use it. Doess it make sense to you?
 ddreams: @ProAnonymous do you want the angle between your pod and the target checkpoint?
 ProAnonymous: Yes yes yes... :D
 ProAnonymous: but i don't see how to could it from sin (angle ) because how should i select the one 0 or maybe i selected wrong way for it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: atan2(dy,dx)??  i guess
 ProAnonymous: (not could )-&gt; count
 Remi.: Ah bah les submits ce soir sont bien plus rapides que ce matin ^^
 Remi.: oups sorry
 Astrobytes: did you reset your code? All the inputs change in Gold 'pod racing' unfortunately
 Astrobytes: :flag_fr:
 ProAnonymous: PatrickMcGinnisII I've tried but it doesn't work correclty
 Scarfield: the output needed changes as well right?
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII hasn't messed with it in ages</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: I honestly cannot remember back that far lol
 ProAnonymous: currently my pods work without distance to TargetCheckpoint and Angle but they can only get to 2,638 position
 Scarfield: you dont really need to now the angle as such. you need to know what (x,y) to aim for
 Astrobytes: max thrust I think changes to 200
 Astrobytes: from 100
 Scarfield: thats for legend asaik
 Astrobytes: oh, mb
 Astrobytes: ignore me :zipper_mouth:
 ProAnonymous: I use angle to understand which thrust should be, it absolutely should be used
 ProAnonymous: if angle is more then 100 you need only 20 of thurs
 ProAnonymous: thrust
 Scarfield: then you have to calculate the angle between pod position and CP position from coordinates, and compare to angle of pod direction
 Astrobytes: max thrust or nothing, drift
 ProAnonymous: Scarfield right, but i didn't find any way how to do it - that is the problem
 Scarfield: you know some trigonometry?
 Tiramon: hm only 500 ranks up with wind and shorter ways ... i expected more
 Astrobytes: Tiramon: the league cannot be trusted currently, very unstable
 Tiramon: any idea why?
 cegprakash: is_controlled only gives if a monster is under control.. any idea to find who is controlling it?
 Astrobytes: lots of rng, server issues, very large league
 Tiramon: ok so as always in pre silver&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: ProAnonymous here is a hint, your output is a point for your pods to aim for. you dont need to know the angle actually, but if you take the pods velocity into account, you can adjust the position you target with your pods. no angles are needed for a decent bot&#160;:)
 ProAnonymous: Scarfield 
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: don't think so and why would that be useful?
 cegprakash: if I'm already controlling the monster I don't care about it.. if enemy is controlling it I'm scared
 struct: well you know if you are controlling it
 rwilson: you could just remember
 Astrobytes: ^
 cegprakash: enemy could control same monster I controlled from fog
 rwilson: goes in average direction  ... you know it's vx,vy , if it's not what you said , you know you tied the control request with unseen enemy
 ddreams: if it doesn't do what you expect, it must be controlled by the enemy
 Astrobytes: you can detect changes if you track them
 ProAnonymous: I already use speed of my pod, speed of opponents pod. speed between my pod and checkpoint
 ProAnonymous: Scarfield 
 Astrobytes: +1 for rwilsons reply
 cegprakash: mm another tracking and fog of war contest then -_- I like fog of war.. tracking is boring
 Astrobytes: " I like fog of war.. tracking is boring"
 Astrobytes: interesting statement
 ddreams: then don't track :p
 Scarfield: :p
 ProAnonymous: :P
 maxtak: is there a way to flip sides for testing
 Astrobytes: yes
 maxtak: how?
 Scarfield: press the delete below player avatars, and choose wichever you want
 Astrobytes: go to where you see your name/avatar under PLAYERS
 Astrobytes: and swap them
 maxtak: cool thanks
 Astrobytes: beaten again&#160;:(
 Scarfield: are you typing with your nose today astro xD
 Astrobytes: tbf I was typing on the other screen before I noticed this one
 Scarfield: 2 in a row, im on fire
 Scarfield: type on the keyboard i would suggest
 Astrobytes: ffs 
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: anyway, im off for today, gn all&#160;:)
 struct: cya
 Astrobytes: gn mate, take care
 DomiKo: gn
 struct: I have on more question, bear with me :p, if I pushed and it hits the wall will it stop there or the following?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/Cn2hysC.png">https://i.imgur.com/Cn2hysC.png</a>
 struct: If I pushed that spider it would and without collision it would land at the end of the red line
 struct: What is the final position of the spider?
 struct: does it follow the black line?
 struct: Or it stays on the blue circle
 DomiKo: hmmm
 Astrobytes: this is outside of a base right
 struct: inside
 Astrobytes: It's a lil vague iirc
 struct: I think its the point of intersection
 struct: so the blue dot
 DomiKo: spider can be 800 units outside map
 struct: Yeah but this push would make it hit the base wall
 Astrobytes: ask me again tomorrow when I've not had 4 Stellas
 struct: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct since it's from direction of spellcaster, and you are blue ... i don't think it moves at all
 Astrobytes: no, it's a theoretical push Patrick
 Astrobytes: blue is not the pushing unit
 struct: Yeah sorry
 struct: Blue is where the collision would be
 struct: I wonder if the spider stops there or not
 struct: That blue dot is inside base radius
 DomiKo: from reading the code, I believe it should stop at blue dot
 Astrobytes: that's my first response too but as I said, don't trust me rn
 DomiKo: because they calculate intersection with wall, and then just snap it to game zone
 Astrobytes: as in the snapToGameZone metho
 Astrobytes: dd
 DomiKo: and ofc after symmetric truncate
 struct: yeah
 struct: thats what I understood from it too
 struct: thanks
 DomiKo: there is a lot of cases 
 Astrobytes: my 'd' key is ying FFS
 Astrobytes: *dying
 Astrobytes: that &amp; F6, and I on't have a soldering iron
 struct: time to use on screen keyboard
 PatrickMcGinnisII: baseWallIntersection
 Astrobytes: lol struct
 Astrobytes: i'll take my keyboar malfunction as a sign and say goonight
 Astrobytes: *goodnight
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: see you all tomorrow and take care
 Wontonimo: goodnight Astrobytes
 Wontonimo: another 250 people passed me since I last logged on.  
 Wontonimo: yesterday I was at 200, now with the same bot it is 670th.  Lots of improvements are being submitted at the top.  That's cool
 MichExpatMatt: I wish the submission history also tracked what rank each submission ended up with. By percentile I seem to keep dropping but also confusing myself over which strats performed better or worse :sweat_smile:
 Wontonimo: don't pay too much attention to rank.  Instead try keeping track of score.  Although my rank fell by 470, my score is about the same 31.50
 struct: I need something to wake me up
 struct: Havent coded anything yet
 MichExpatMatt: Glad it's not just me Wonto! I think I was below 200 last night (UTC -7:00) and now I can't seem to get back into the 4's
 MoMaT: drink a cup of coffee, and then nap for 30  minutes
 MichExpatMatt: I was trying to measure percentile rather than just straight rank number
 Wontonimo: get away from your computer and don't allow yourself back until you have an idea and are keen about it
 struct: I think I'm trying to skips steps like always
 Wontonimo: the score is pretty good.  It is like a chess score where every 4 points is about a 10:1 win ratio, so if you are 8 points away from somone then there is a 10*10 = 100 in 1 chance the underdog will win
 Wontonimo: if your score is within 0.1 of another score, it is pretty much the same strength.  It's too bad they show 2 decimal places because it isn't that precise
 MichExpatMatt: Where are you seeing score with two decimal places?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2022/leaderboard/global?column=CODINGAMER&amp;value=ALL">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2022/leaderboard/global?column=CODINGAMER&amp;value=ALL</a>
 MichExpatMatt: oh nice! I was just viewing the popout leaderboard before
 Wontonimo: also click "leaderboard" on the left just under last battle and history
 Wontonimo: There is a nice filter called "You follow".  Follow some people that you'd like to benchmark youself against and that filter makes the list a lot more manageable
 Gedzius: Will there be more rules in silver league&#160;?
 Wontonimo: the popup when entering bronze said no
 Wontonimo: but it appears no one reads those 
 Wontonimo: well, gotta get ready to go out for standup comedy.  Have fun slaying bugs :wave: :bug:
 Gedzius: Just wanted to make sure
 FerrusDude: Yea I got that error, probably a crashed instance
 FerrusDude: lol, pardon me. chat pulled a auto scroll on me :D
 FerrusDude: do we know when silver drops?
 yhyoxx: sunday 3pm utc
 lem101: hey guys. I beat the boss, how do I go to the next league?
 struct: you need to wait for all your battles to finish
 struct: are you above the boss on the leaderboard?
 lem101: yeah
 lem101: maybe i need to wait longer actually, cheers
 Greatgib: Do you think that the "threat_for" makes sense?
 Greatgib: it has value 1 for monsters that are not at all in the direction of the base.
 Greatgib: or does it mean that it will touch once the "yellow" area? 
 pmor: yes, if it touches that area, then it targets the base and changes direction towards it
 Greatgib: ok, this is what was not clear. thanks
 Th1nhNg0: wow Im in top 10 xD
 pmor: grats
 Th1nhNg0: look like there is nothing to unlock&#160;?
 struct: new league opens monday I think
 struct: where top N% will go through
 Th1nhNg0: cool
 WingedDT: when do promos between leagues happen?
 pmor: heh, i like your strat of being a bastard to the nme defenders
 Th1nhNg0: pmor you say me? xD
 pmor: yeah.  nice use of control + wind
 Th1nhNg0: the movement of the sabotage hero is not satisfy me yet
 WannaBeHum1n: i think i am gonna do a peaceful run
 WannaBeHum1n: get silver without sabotage
 pmor: the matches where the attackers and defenders really get into it are fun to watch
 Th1nhNg0: yea, this game is really fun to watch
 Th1nhNg0: and have a lot of strategy
 Th1nhNg0: I found a guy use 2 hero to sabotage and it completely destroy me xD
 WannaBeHum1n: i beat bronze ai 1st time
 WannaBeHum1n:&#160;:)
 pmor: butcher2013 is the true boss
 pmor: bot is a monster
 SandmanSW96: this seems fuzzy on the tiebreaker in this challenge
 SandmanSW96: oh this "wild mana"
 pmor: Yeah, encourages people to not turtle
 SandmanSW96: lol my 1.0 is a damn nice turtle so far
 ItsDerpy: is turtling with mana a viable option currently or is it out of meta
 Th1nhNg0: what do you mean turtle?
 pmor: sit back and protect your base
 archfan7411: I find turtling to be much less effective in bronze
 ItsDerpy: i would want to surevy base so they could be lucky 
 ItsDerpy: but i dont effectively know how to find each individuals placement on the board
 Neabfi: Hi all, I can't find the order in which the actions are performed. All the entities move first, and then the damage are computed? Do the spiders die before they damage the place we need to defend?
 Thorcode: they will die if they damage the base
 Thorcode: and omg the first bot got beaten alot
 ItsDerpy: i think the round takes place and the spiders move each round 
 Neabfi: I meant if my hero kill the spider the same turn the spider damage the base
 ItsDerpy: it would dmg the base first i think
 Neabfi: Will this save the base?
 Neabfi: ok thanks!
 Thorcode: the dmg first i think
 Thorcode: why do my rank better than the bot but i can't promote?
 Neabfi: promotion is every couple minutes just wait 10 min 
 iTsluku: first leagues take time (its kinda random)
 Thorcode: i that that time
 Thorcode: i hate the time
 ItsDerpy: is demoting a possibility
 Thorcode: nah
 archfan7411: How do I see what rank the bot is?
 Thorcode: there is no demote in codingame
 Thorcode: check the leaderboard
 Thorcode: time waiting suck
 iTsluku: u can cleanup your code, write some utility stuff
 Thorcode: i know bruh
 Thorcode: i need to wait
 iTsluku: usually if u complain it gets resolved :D
 Thorcode: yeah
 iTsluku: like sb is watching xd
 Thorcode: resolved :oy:
 Thorcode: susy sentence
 Ch3oul: is the silver league unlocked?
 iTsluku: tomorrow
 Ch3oul: oh okay thx for the information 
 Thorcode: nice
 iTsluku: idk what exact time tho, 24th sth maybe 15utc but i really dont remember
 mybk: GMT: Sunday 24 April 2022 15:00:00
 WannaBeHum1n: at turn 130
 WannaBeHum1n: game ends with this
 Thorcode: maybe wrong command
 WannaBeHum1n: the same commands are used before in the roles i only use move and wind
 WannaBeHum1n: how can it be wriong&#160;?
 Thorcode: wind x y?
 iTsluku: spell wind x y
 WannaBeHum1n: because i cant know which command is wrong
 iTsluku: check the line that is printed
 iTsluku: if u scroll down
 WannaBeHum1n: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e96e6ad-257c-494e-a0b6-6e8befe68dbd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6e96e6ad-257c-494e-a0b6-6e8befe68dbd</a>
 Dr_teRic: Is it normal to wait over 15 min for promotion?
 Thorcode: yep
 WannaBeHum1n: which line&#160;?
 Thorcode: i used to wait more than 1h to up to gold
 Dr_teRic: is there a timer or something? Im in wood 2 rank 1
 Thorcode: yep
 Thorcode: they need to wait
 Thorcode: you need to wait for a while
 Dr_teRic: but i cant see the timer?
 Thorcode: just wait
 Dr_teRic: ok thx
 Thorcode: the you will se the timer
 Thorcode: my god
 Thorcode: the pixel too big i forgot to check the map infor
 iTsluku: dude how come i think i improve my bot and then end up losing to my old bot the whole time hahahahahah
 Thorcode: bruh
 Enknable: it usually comes does to thinking: the utility function is: x**3 + 2x**2 + 1, when it's really: x**6 -3x**4 + 2x**2 - 8i
 Enknable: lol
 Thorcode: the wind speell suck
 Enknable: and you just changed ur x**1 power
 WannaBeHum1n:  [does using wind with no mana give bad command&#160;?
 iTsluku: just test it
 WannaBeHum1n: how to tag sm1 in this chat
 iTsluku: @name i guess
 WannaBeHum1n: @iTsluku test test
 WannaBeHum1n: was it highlited 4 u&#160;?
 iTsluku: its i nred for me now, but spamm will make it useless
 iTsluku: maybe try direct msg but then again i dont think anyone checks msg tabs
 iTsluku: chantroom tabs*
 WannaBeHum1n: i thought tag didnt work cuz name wasnt highlited
 iTsluku: chatroom*
 WannaBeHum1n: now i know it works
 WannaBeHum1n: thnc
 WannaBeHum1n: thnx*
 iTsluku: @WannaBeHum1n works
 WannaBeHum1n: &lt;3
 WannaBeHum1n: ty
 WannaBeHum1n: @Mybk thnx 4 the dm
 Neabfi: Is there any differences between WAIT and MOVE to current location&#160;?
 iTsluku: nope
 WannaBeHum1n: nope
 Enknable: I think you just need iTsluku
 Enknable: no need for @
 Neabfi: ty!
 Enknable:&#160;?
 iTsluku: u are right Enknable
 Enknable: :thumbsup:
 iTsluku: lul u can even autofill the name with tab in here
 iTsluku: nice
 Enknable: codingame devs are 1337 fsho 
 WannaBeHum1n: what  rank is the boss at in bronze&#160;?
 Enknable: I don't think there is a boss yet..since silver isn't open
 WannaBeHum1n: no silver&#160;?
 Enknable: that might be wrong tho
 WannaBeHum1n: huuhh
 Enknable: again, might be wrong
 Enknable: but I think once Silver league opens
 Enknable: then they release the Bronze Boss
 AlekseiIvanov: hello guys.... how to show message near of my hero?
 theycallmedavid: IIRC that is right, boss becomes the AI that is there at the cut
 StrideNYC: Oh cool just saw the email for the event. Good luck everyone&#160;:)
 Enknable: and he's the guardkeepers
 Mortis_666: AlekseiIvanov add the message after your command, ex. MOVE 0 0 hi
 AlekseiIvanov: thank you
 WannaBeHum1n: brooo
 WannaBeHum1n: like my heros only go back base to wind the monsters sent by sabotagers
 WannaBeHum1n: how do i lode by wild mana
 WannaBeHum1n: lose*
 WannaBeHum1n: any tips
 Enknable: i think you collect mana for kills
 Enknable: In case of a tie, you have gained the highest amount of wild mana: mana gained outside the radius of your base.
 Enknable: if you look at the Victory Conditions
 Enknable: you'll see
 WannaBeHum1n: yh 
 WannaBeHum1n: i am asking for tips sincemy heros enter base only when necessary
 WannaBeHum1n: like 4+ monsters on base
 WannaBeHum1n: and i stole lose by mana points
 Enknable: ah so you wanna gain mana points faster
 Enknable:&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: yis
 Enknable: and you don't wind monsters unless their in your base
 WannaBeHum1n: yes only if they are 500units away from base i use wind 
 Enknable: do you attack in groups? or each hero attacks a different monster?
 WannaBeHum1n: based on the number of monsters targeting my base 
 WannaBeHum1n: if only 1 target
 WannaBeHum1n: stack on him
 WannaBeHum1n: if 2 target
 WannaBeHum1n: split into 2 groups
 WannaBeHum1n: and so on
 Enknable: that seems smart id keep that
 Enknable: so lastly
 Enknable: ...do you poach your opponents kills?
 WannaBeHum1n: no
 Enknable: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 WannaBeHum1n: lemme gogle 'poach'
 Enknable: then you should
 WannaBeHum1n: brb
 WannaBeHum1n: cook (an egg) without its shell in or over boiling water.
 WannaBeHum1n: wtf is poach xD
 WannaBeHum1n: u mean steal right&#160;?
 Enknable: yeah
 WannaBeHum1n: so i assume i target low health enemies if i dont have high priority targets heading to base&#160;?
 Enknable: well you get points for "hits" on enemies
 Enknable: so..
 Enknable: you'd actually want to deprive him of actual attacks
 Enknable: no just the execution
 Enknable: *kill it before he gets the chance*
 WannaBeHum1n: so i start looking for 1 heading to his base
 WannaBeHum1n: daym
 WannaBeHum1n: that is evil
 WannaBeHum1n: i like it
 Enknable: and remember you can share the execute point with him
 Enknable: so if hes going to kill it, you can attack it and get the mana too
 Runner87: which is the effect of SHIELD on opponent heroes&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: it is not who gets the last hiy&#160;?
 Enknable: 1 point of mana per damage dealt to a monster, even from monsters with no health left.
 WannaBeHum1n: ohhhhh
 WannaBeHum1n: man thnx 4 ur help
 WannaBeHum1n: truly apprecite it
 Enknable: :thumbsup: gl!
 yhyoxx: even from monsters with no health left. what does it mean&#160;?
 Enknable: if 3 of your guys attack one monster with 1 hp, you will get 3 mana
 WannaBeHum1n: monster has 1 hp
 WannaBeHum1n: u all attack in same turn
 Enknable: ^
 WannaBeHum1n: all get mana if  i understood him
 yhyoxx: gotcha
 yhyoxx: monster doesnt disappear until all heroes played
 WannaBeHum1n: yup
 WannaBeHum1n: btw
 WannaBeHum1n: which is the effect of SHIELD on opponent heroes&#160;?
 WannaBeHum1n: never thought of this
 WannaBeHum1n: someone asked above
 WannaBeHum1n: i really dont use shields rn
 WannaBeHum1n: but this is intersting
 theycallmedavid: I think it is The target entity cannot be targeted by spells for the next 12 rounds.
 WannaBeHum1n: soiiiii
 WannaBeHum1n: soooooo
 WannaBeHum1n: if i shield enemy and wind the monsters close to em
 WannaBeHum1n: they wont get blown with wind
 WannaBeHum1n: so they have to chase
 WannaBeHum1n: the ones i used wind against
 WannaBeHum1n: this is more evil
 WannaBeHum1n: xD
 Runner87: I gave it a try ... but for now it s no so useful 
 WannaBeHum1n: what is ur current rank
 WannaBeHum1n: maybe it is worth 4 me
 Runner87: 600th
 WannaBeHum1n: i am 800
 WannaBeHum1n: all lost by mana
 Thorcode: this game kinda fun
 WannaBeHum1n: i am enjoying it so much
 WannaBeHum1n: cant wait to see someone his deep learning AI ML GOD LEVEL AI in yt when it is over
 WannaBeHum1n: and me looking at my if statement and switch
 Enknable: sadly, I don't think you can train a model offline then upload it
 Enknable: :cry:
 Enknable: I think Q-Learning would be the best estimate.
 Kyraleese: the source code of the game is available, you absolutely could do something like train a neural net locally if you wanted to, and then create a net based ont hose results here.
 Enknable: I don't think I've read about any bots like that here..I don't think you can upload anything or use network resources
 Enknable: so your model would have to be a string or something, which you parsed and translated?
 Kyraleese: So if you get to bronze, they include the source code of the game on github.  You run that locally, and then train your neural net.  You record the values of whatever net ends up being the "winner", and then the code you submit to codingame, you just hardcode the net based on what your local trained net came up with.
 Kyraleese: whether or not it's worth it to do that is unclear; I've never actually trained bots before, mine tend to be rules-based
 Enknable: that would def be cool, no doubt. I haven't actually seen someone do that.
 Enknable: I think some people have created utility functions and then trained coefficients for those utility functions using local ML Learning
 Enknable: but honestly, im out of my depth speaking there lol
 Kyraleese: I went from Wood2 -&gt; Bronze with a simple "attack the monster that is closest to my base" tactic.
 Kyraleese: Now I'm working on tweaking it
 Thorcode: with starter kit?
 pmor: Same thing happened to me.  I was working on my wind code for Wood1 and got pinged that I made it to bronze
 Thorcode: your rank just need to be higher than the boss
 Kyraleese: I am the one who wrote the ruby starter kit.  But for that I just pick the first monster in the list.  It's up to the user to modify.
 Noyotens: how to qualify to bronze
 Noyotens: i defeated the bot
 Noyotens: and submited
 Noyotens: but still
 Mortis_666: wait
 Noyotens: ok
 Kyraleese: I think it only moves people up every couple minutes.  Last time I did this, it used to say how long before those above the bot would be moved on.  I didn't see that this time.
 MeWhenI: after you submit to arena, you have to wait for the "matches completed" meter to reach 100%
 Kyraleese: and then usually a little while after that, too.
 Kyraleese: I think it also depends on how busy it is at the time you submit.
 MeWhenI: yeah
 Noyotens: ok7
 Noyotens: ill wait
 MeWhenI: yesterday it was taking like an hour to do a full bronze arena run, now its down to a couple minutes
 yhyoxx: less people testing in the arena&#160;?
 NinjaPuffin1: does shield spell block wind spell&#160;?
 MeWhenI: yes
 archfan7411: yeah
 NinjaPuffin1: ta
 MeWhenI: it also blocks control (and shield)
 NinjaPuffin1: :thumbsup:
 EvModder: evening gamers
 Kyraleese: how long a run takes also depends on how your bot performs.  If it figures out early on you're not that high, it doesn't run as many battles, I believe.  There is a algorithm it uses so that it doesn't have to run you against everyone
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: I found when i control one monster in the radius of base, it will go back in the direction to base when it reaches the edge of the circle? is it right? 
 MeWhenI: not sure exactly what you mean by "when it reaches the edge of the circle"
 MeWhenI: but my understanding is that if a monster ends a turn inside your base radius, it will always turn towards your base, even if you just controlled it away
 Ayza: is there any way to keep track of the heroes coordinates?
 Kyraleese: yes, you're given those every turn
 Kyraleese: assuming you can see them (later levels have fog of war)
 Kyraleese: and you can obviously see yourself, so you'll always get at least your hero's positions.
 YiCao-EnfuNiu-LingSong: Thanks  for MeWhenl. You answered for me.
 BenjaminUrquhart: finally I finished my initial bot framework so I can actually do stuff and not be in wood all week
 Kyraleese: That is always a satisfying thing, but also annoying when you just want to get out of the league
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah
 BenjaminUrquhart: also the way I wrote it, it will probably implode one anything changes
 BenjaminUrquhart: once*
 Kyraleese: only one way to find out
 BenjaminUrquhart: I finished 9 points above the joke wood2 boss lol
 Kyraleese: I skipped right through wood 1.
 BenjaminUrquhart: well let
 BenjaminUrquhart: let's see how this does with fog of war
 Kyraleese: Submitted my very basic wood 2 bot during lunch, went back to work, checked in on things during a short break about an hour or so later and oh hey, bronze.
 BenjaminUrquhart: looks like I need to fix up my pruning code
 BenjaminUrquhart: although I might skip wood1 as well
 BenjaminUrquhart: doesn't look like it though
 Kyraleese: here's hoping
 Kyraleese: although I usually prefer not to skip because then I'm not making massive edits to take into account new rules 
 therealbeef: Enknable, neural networks are actually very commonly used here by top bots. last year's contest winner was NN based in combination with MCTS (so like alphazero)
 therealbeef: although due to time limitations they don't really dominate contests
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah I didn't skip wood1, just got a high placement
 Thorcode: you could skipp
 Thorcode: just wait
 BenjaminUrquhart: don't really want to though
 Huy12345: hello
 Thorcode: hi
 erick.lee: hi
 frosi: :grimacing:
 Thorcode: bronze really hrad
 BenjaminUrquhart: can wind push monsters out of bounds
 Enknable: therealbeef, which contest? Was there a post-mortem?
 Lysk: only outside base radius: "A monster can be pushed outside of the map, unless it is within a base radius, in which case it will will be moved no further than the border." BenjaminUrquhart
 Enknable: pretty cool cost benefit to a tiny ML core and MCTS
 therealbeef: spring 2021 contest. indeed the winner wrote a nice postmortem how he did it

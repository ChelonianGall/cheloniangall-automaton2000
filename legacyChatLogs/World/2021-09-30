 DJManeatingNoodle_bd90: Hi,I am Hariharan,I am new here!
 ProCoder03: HI Harihara
 derjack: hello new here
 NovaSBae: hola
 NovaSBae: dont learn c++ trust me
 Ciss: I wish i learn Java well
 Ciss: just wish:grinning:
 derjack: java :tada:
 Benji-the-scripter: Hello day 6 here im here, and I feel safe for some reason on this website =D
 derjack: will all those trolls? :thinking:
 Benji-the-scripter:&#160;?
 TimothyAlexisVass: Wish you happiness and success in life Benji.
 Benji-the-scripter: Yeah if i get good grades in my school. Lmao :joy:
 TimothyAlexisVass: There are many better ways to achieve happiness and success but if that is what you think works best for you, I wish you all the best with that choice.
 Benji-the-scripter: Im happy but success... I dont think so, not even on this website
 derjack: did you solve any puzzles here
 Benji-the-scripter: Nah only begginers "onboardin"
 Benji-the-scripter: beginers
 Uljahn: :unamused:
 Uljahn: you're not safe here then
 WillChang: not 'very' safe
 WillChang: :grinning:
 Uljahn: why even join the coding community if you don't code and don't like to?
 Uljahn: attention-seeking behaviour is not welcomed here
 Andriamanitra: who are you even talking to
 Benji-the-scripter: Probably me... =(
 Uljahn: to those chilling low level users
 Benji-the-scripter: Yeah me =(
 Benji-the-scripter: Im just trying to code, im learning but slowly. And im not chilling in the chat, im coding
 Uljahn: what are you coding?
 Benji-the-scripter: Trying to do some AI with python 3
 Benji-the-scripter: Slowly starting to understand it
 Uljahn: you mean pod racing?
 WillChang: huh
 Benji-the-scripter: yeah...
 Benji-the-scripter: Not for me?
 Uljahn: why
 Benji-the-scripter: I asked if it is something for new ppl
 Andriamanitra: new to the site or new to programming?
 Benji-the-scripter: Programming
 Andriamanitra: if you're only learning to program you might want to start with the beginner puzzles
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Uljahn: you should know the basics before you start practicing
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Benji-the-scripter: thanks uljahn and Andriamanitra 
 Jolof: learn by doing is perfectly fine :D
 Benji-the-scripter: Anyways gotta do the school work bye =)
 Uljahn: yes, but it might be painful
 Jolof: Sure, but then you can read up on the stuff that is painful 
 Benji-the-scripter: Gotta do the school work. Now or never bye
 Benji-the-scripter: =)
 Uljahn: guess if you like coding you won't be discouraged by pain
 emilt: true
 emilt: been debugging a frontend problem for two weeks, now management decided we have to rewrite the code
 Trevodorax: Ayooo
 Trevodorax: I thought i was good at C
 Trevodorax: but i fcking s√ªck
 Trevodorax: :bento:
 Uljahn: are you good at reading?this might be helpful <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/getting-started-on-codingame">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/getting-started-on-codingame</a>
 Trevodorax: No no i just have the problem solving skills of a sick moose
 Uljahn: Some easy puzzles have a hint panel on the left side of the IDE. You can use it and after you get 100% on submit you can inspect community solutions
 Trevodorax: yeah i think i'll take a look at the solutions
 Trevodorax: I'll learn that way
 Uljahn: sure thing
 Trevodorax: thx for your help
 Trevodorax: :cooking:
 Benji-the-scripter: Some good facts about "Island" in "Norden"?
 Uljahn: Benji-the-scripter: how is it related to codingame? please don't post nonsense here, it's a warning
 Trevodorax: Just finished my first challenge, I'm so happy
 Trevodorax: now I'm tryna do the cuck norris encryption, it's kinda hard
 Trevodorax: chuck*
 derjack:&#160;:+1:
 Trevodorax: any advice for the chuck norris encryption&#160;?
 Trevodorax: Like a starting point&#160;?
 Trevodorax: Cuz I'm blocked rn
 khadija_as: any recomendations for easy puzzles to start with I'm new here
 khadija_as:&#160;?
 TimothyAlexisVass: How new are you to coding?
 khadija_as: not new to coding but new to this platform
 TimothyAlexisVass: Well any of the easy puzzles then.
 TimothyAlexisVass: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>

 TimothyAlexisVass: Then you need to do those first.
 khadija_as: this isn't showing the solve it
 khadija_as: so i can code and test
 ProCoder03: click on it 
 khadija_as: give me examples of easy level
 khadija_as: cant find

 Benji-the-scripter: Im sorry Uljahn for posting that thing before, sorry
 LagunaElectric: Morning bbs :D
 Eleios: elo
 LagunaElectric: How's it goin?
 LagunaElectric: I think I'm doing this interpreter all wrong, and I've hit a roadblock because of it
 Astrobytes: Start over. Read a little bit about writing interpreters perhaps.
 Astrobytes: No shame in starting over.
 Scarfield: RestarBytes
 Astrobytes: Overfield
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: saw the mail about the escape contest&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it wasn't unexpected but still disappointing&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Tis what it is.
 MSmits: your math is right
 MSmits: it equals it
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Scarfield: wise words for a penny
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: thanks
 LagunaElectric: Will likely have to start over, yea Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: LagunaElectric: google some material on writing interpreters, for BF or otherwise
 LagunaElectric: I've been storing the instructions and trying to loop over them, but run into problems when I have to adjust the index cuz python for doesn't care about you setting "i" to other things
 eulerscheZahl: "saw the mail about the escape contest"there's an email about it?
 Astrobytes: There was I think
 Scarfield: yup
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because i never registered
 eulerscheZahl: smart toad
 LagunaElectric: Yep, I wanted to give it a go without looking it up first to see if I could :D Gonna go dive into some material now
 Astrobytes: Good learning opportunity&#160;;)
 LagunaElectric: It was interesting trying to figure out how to get as far as I have
 LagunaElectric: I mean, half of the tests pass at least xD
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1u8cg01">https://prnt.sc/1u8cg01</a>
 Scarfield: the mail ^
 Astrobytes: don't throw the code away, you might look at it later and see something you missed
 LagunaElectric: How do I do the codingame pastebin thing?
 Scarfield: it does it automatically if too many characters or new lines
 LagunaElectric: ah
 LagunaElectric: I'll use github gist to share for syntax highlighting then
 Astrobytes: don't post it here if it's mostly working
 LagunaElectric: hmm
 Astrobytes: solution sharing and all that
 LagunaElectric: ohhhhhhhhh yea
 LagunaElectric: I mean, that's fair
 Scarfield: assumed it was an assignment, there is a puzzle where you write an enterpreter?
 LagunaElectric: Yes!
 Astrobytes: brainfuck interpreter
 LagunaElectric: Brainfuck interpreter
 Scarfield: ooh yea 
 LagunaElectric: I've never done one before, and i'm enjoying it quite a bit :D
 LagunaElectric: Very interesting challenge
 Scarfield: just had a look, its pretty cool, I have to do that some day, and try the code of the rings as well
 Westicles: I'm not feeling confident about adding functions for Bender4
 Westicles: I guess you can add random unnecessary UD LR etc. pairs and see if it helps make it shorter overall
 Scarfield: check for reoccuring patterns in your solution, if adding ";" plus the reoccuring pattern is shorter its worth it. at least a very simple way to reduce the string a little
 Westicles: yeah, right now I just add the next function that kills the most characters.  but the result isn't all that great
 Scarfield: you can walk into walls as well, so some cases UUU wil have the same result as UU, giving room for some extra function usage
 Westicles: that's a good idea
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 Charasss: salut
 eulerscheZahl: wow, dbdr got beaten at Bender
 PrivatePencilCaseOfDeath_75f2: how can i do to find an angular codingame
 eulerscheZahl: you have found it already. the UI is done with Angular JS
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: MSmits we need your brain. locally counting tic tac toe, first player wins over 90% games. i dont know if im bugged
 Astrobytes: I only played it a little bit but I did get the feeling it's in favour of P1
 Wontonimo: nice mcts bot jacek
 Wontonimo: in counting ttt
 jacek: mhm
 jacek: have you tested how much p1 has advantage?
 jacek: also yet another chess nn book <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/asdfjkl/neural_network_chess">https://github.com/asdfjkl/neural_network_chess</a>
 Stilgart: yet another&#160;?
 jacek: well nn chess article or tutorial
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md">https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch/blob/master/docs/nnue.md</a>
 jacek: though that book covers much more
 Stilgart: oh, I totally missed that nnue was used for chess
 Stilgart: anyway, thanks for these links
 Astrobytes: been a while now stockfish has been using it iirc
 Scarfield: its dated for today, you are on top of chess stuff chescek
 Astrobytes: talkchess I guess
 jacek: whats new chessfield
 Scarfield: Neural Networks for Chess by Dominik Klein is pretty new
 LagunaElectric: Boys I'm an idiot
 Astrobytes: lol Scarfboard
 LagunaElectric: I completely forgot that while loops exist
 Astrobytes: has this fixed your interpreter?
 LagunaElectric: No, but it does enable me to continue it :D
 LagunaElectric: Well I guess that means yes?
 jacek: robo is back to bt eh
 Astrobytes: lol, steps in the right direction&#160;;)
 LagunaElectric: At any rate, I can continue trying to implement it, and I learned some things about bracket matching :D
 LagunaElectric: Yea!
 LagunaElectric: Say, Astrobytes, how long have you been a developer?
 Astrobytes: I'm not&#160;:)
 jacek: oO
 LagunaElectric: Not even as a hobby?
 LagunaElectric: Why are you here??
 Astrobytes: yeah a hobby
 LagunaElectric: Yea, that counts!
 Astrobytes: a looooong time, but only seriously the past few years I guess
 LagunaElectric: Nice!
 LagunaElectric: What are some of your favorite languages so far?
 Astrobytes: are you using regexp for your interpreter btw?
 LagunaElectric: No, it's only 8 chars in the language so I'm ignoring any chars not in that set and just using if statements at the moment
 Astrobytes: C++, C, C# is pretty nice
 LagunaElectric: C# is my favorite!
 Astrobytes: python is useful, perl is useful
 Astrobytes: At the end of the day though, you use whatever tool/language that is best for what you need to accomplish
 LagunaElectric: Python is my default now. The moment I need something more powerful I go to C#, but Python does most of what I need on a regular basis well enough and it's faster to whip stuff up in
 LagunaElectric: Yes
 LagunaElectric: I've been a dev for 8 years :D
 LagunaElectric: I really want to give Kotlin a look, too
 LagunaElectric: those dataclasses look nice
 Astrobytes: Kotlin has nice features, fiddly syntax sometimes but nice with all the functional stuff. I should practice it more tbh
 jacek: learn java. use java to kotlin converter [solved]
 Astrobytes: I prefer the 'learn the bare minimum you require' approach to Java 
 Wontonimo: jacek - i have notice that the first player in count-ttt has a large advantage.  A cake-cutting like connect4 for first move would really help.
 LagunaElectric: Why would you learn java to convert to kotlin, when the point of kotlin is extending Java and providing more modern constructs and patterns?
 Wontonimo: self torture?
 LagunaElectric: Fax
 Wontonimo: machine - lovely contrib, just saying
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: IntelliJ has a Java =&gt; Kotlin converter integrated
 jacek: why is it not called IntelliK
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95448">https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/95448</a>
 jacek: lets make new lang - kava!
 jacek: untrained policy-only agent wins 80% vs random in c4 :thinking:
 LagunaElectric: Did it!
 JacobTheCoder: nice!
 JacobTheCoder: im working on my .lua and C++ coding
 JacobTheCoder: so far i only made a roblox menu with .lua lol
 Astrobytes: LagunaElectric: nice one! well done&#160;:)
 JacobTheCoder: i actually have an avatar now lol
 jacek: :tada:
 LagunaElectric: Indeed! Wanna have a look, Astrobytes?
 JacobTheCoder: lol
 Astrobytes: LagunaElectric: no, I've not done it yet, don't spoil me :D
 JacobTheCoder: ahh spoilers lol
 LagunaElectric: Alright, but it's not bad!
 JacobTheCoder: ill take a look?
 LagunaElectric: It was very fun, and now I have a brainfuck interpreter!
 JacobTheCoder: lol
 LagunaElectric: Have you completed the challenge yourself yet, Jacob?
 Astrobytes: there are a few more interpreter-type puzzles around iirc
 JacobTheCoder: @LangunaElectric yes but its kinda bad
 JacobTheCoder:&#160;:(
 JacobTheCoder: im sitting here typing while my classmates and teacher is joking about bullying lol
 LagunaElectric: F
 jacek: huh
 LagunaElectric: I'll send you a link :D
 JacobTheCoder: ok
 JacobTheCoder:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: joking about bullying doesn't seem overly helpful to me
 JacobTheCoder: well no its more like if you are disrespectful its on you and your not affecting others somn lke that
 JacobTheCoder: as if its not taken seriously
 Kitis: hi
 JacobTheCoder: hi

 Wontonimo: or lead
 Astrobytes: PeeBee as we used to say back in highschool chemistry 
 Astrobytes: PeeBeeOhh
 jacek: a puzzle for you: why would random nn policy beat random player with 80% in connect4?
 Wontonimo: you got lucky with the random NN
 Astrobytes: Cause it's shit?
 jacek: when i add some randomness ad hoc in policy output then they even out
 jacek: its over 80% everytime time i run it
 Wontonimo: a randomized NN tends to just prefer one classification in a multi class task.  Compare that to just random 
 Wontonimo: I think mostly playing 1 column will win over random plays
 jacek: oh hmm, it mostly wins by vertical 4
 Wontonimo: there you go
 Astrobytes: There you go
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: slowbytes
 Astrobytes: have a :taco:
 jacek: thankies
 Scarfield: there you go
 Wontonimo: is that a veggie taco?
 Wontonimo: times have changed
 Astrobytes: It's whatever taco you like

 Westicles: this is just the same guy over and over
 Scarfield: improved your bender 4 westi?
 Westicles: not yet.  I just played them manually so my program doesn't know where the walls are yet
 Pygame: hi
 Westicles: ah, dbdr is here, he can give me some hints
 Scarfield: i have a gut feeling that you can get a decent score with some predefined functions and a sim. maybe bfs the functions and "filler" single-actions sim them and keep shortest
 jacek: -3vel
 Scarfield: lol
 Westicles: or you can spend 3 hours playing them manually.   that's what us dumb guys do
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: dont listen to me anyway, im just doing my best pretending to sound smart
 Westicles: but optimizing the functions is more up my alley
 jacek: 1 2 7 3 down to rockefeller street
 Scarfield: why did i google that
 jacek: xD
 Astrobytes: Do people really listen to that stuff?
 jacek: i like to the pic from nightcore version
 Scarfield: i didnt listen to it, just sighed that i still havent learned that when chescek writes something i dont know, chances are i dont really want to know what it means xD
 Scarfield: last time it was some latin MLP stuff
 jacek: regina noctis pro nobis?

 MSmits: swag bag?
 Astrobytes: A hot corny pear?
 Astrobytes: oh right :P
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: what did he win though? 
 MSmits: I dunno whats in the bag
 Scarfield: contest i mean
 Astrobytes: Didn't he miss out on the swag bag of horny pears or whatever
 MSmits: it was some external contest
 MSmits: dont remember the name, you could win a trip to Russia or some such
 Astrobytes: He got a mention in the video and the website or something
 Scarfield: he is a beast
 jacek: gulag eh
 Scarfield: exclusive 1-way trip
 MSmits: good thing he didnt win then
 Astrobytes: Currently you're in 'Pole' position for the cg-gulag jacek :D

 Astrobytes: Nice one Westicles
 Astrobytes: That should save you a discord trip
 Astrobytes: Though there is still AZ
 Astrobytes: oh wait, that should be on clist
 Astrobytes: it isn't? I swear Al Zimmerman used to be listed on clist
 Scarfield: oh didnt event think of discord. im rarely on there, but thanks&#160;:) not sure if im gonna participate in the CG escape contest
 Westicles: I need to start AZ.  Damn hexagons
 Astrobytes: I don't know anyone who is, that I know of anyway
 Scarfield: would probably be fun, but not what im expecting of a contest here
 Astrobytes: Looks like a tough one Westicles
 Astrobytes: Or at the least, fiddly
 Westicles: There are some gigantic boards.  I assume it is just an annealing problem but you never know until you dig into it
 Astrobytes: Was my first thought but it could get ridiculous with those big boards yes, hybrid approach most likely
 Scarfield: AZ? i dont see that mentioned on the links

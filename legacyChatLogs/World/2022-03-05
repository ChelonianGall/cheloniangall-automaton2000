 icecream17: why was troll vs castles refused?
 VizGhar: It was? thanks god
 VizGhar: But i believe it wasnt refused
 VizGhar: There is 30 day period after which contributions are automatically pulled back
 icecream17: codingame.com/contribute/view/507070b7925f661e2d2835c14f950b9d157e
 icecream17: it says "Refused" after "5,523 views"
 VizGhar: yeah...but it wasn't rejected
 VizGhar: I hate this contribution in particular. The main reason is, its there without any change for a year. maybe more
 icecream17: interestingly, pb4 commented "hey jbm_, your game has a bug"
 icecream17: "description: I'm not first anymore"
 icecream17: and the response was "which private key are you currently using?"
 icecream17: so i wonder...
 VizGhar: its 11m ago&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: "I hate this contribution in particular. The main reason is, its there without any change for a year. maybe more"
 eulerscheZahl: 508 upvotes. that's more XP than creating a community contest. and then winning it
 icecream17: it's so simple but so interesting
 eulerscheZahl: but camping on the contributions page since May 2020?
 icecream17: woah, illedan's error report's stack trace has the class "GodModeManager"

 icecream17: and its called "üë∫ TROLL VS üèØ CASTLES üè∞"
 eulerscheZahl: aah. he reported it. not a bug in one of his games
 icecream17: wow the emojis
 <b>**eulerscheZahl hates emojis in titles</b></p><p><img src="/a/51696362414566" /> VizGhar: so cool :D
 eulerscheZahl: also breaks the bot which create forum threads for new puzzles
 VizGhar: genz loves it

 icecream17: i got 5173/14617 with just  math.random
 eulerscheZahl: but you have no idea what the game is about
 eulerscheZahl: there are just a lot of people who were similarly clueless while submitting

 MAWAAW:&#160;:/
 VizGhar: MAWAAW I have realized what was going on by 1. working only on one testcase 2. observing how input changes if I output only one character in game turn
 VizGhar: If the input won't change, then I've probably done something that didn't change the game
 VizGhar: seeing you are already lvl12 you can crack it in 2-3hours :D
 VizGhar: And after that comes the optimization
 AproG: Yo

 jacek: happy Caturday
 martinpapa69: :cat:
 martinpapa69: after playing for a week with rust on thing i dont understand. why would anyone start a project in c++, when there is rust:thinking: im a rust fanboy now
 jacek: :scream:
 ilf: some problems here are unfair, and python always has advantages
 Thorcode: nah
 ImSeaFu: what do you mean?
 Thorcode: you say that bc you only play "clash" i think
 ImSeaFu: I mean python is a powerful language so it's going to have advantages for certain cases
 Thorcode: my prediction is right XD
 jacek: try bot programming in python ~
 soutenu: you could say the same thing about Go since the std has some very specific stuff too
 Thorcode: bot programming c++ player just like got all the 100th places
 VizGhar: either perfect heuristic or neural nets can get you to top with python in bot programming
 ilf: okim from cp and c++ always the bossmaybe this place is not for me
 VizGhar: there is no way you will win those using python and optimization/search algos
 VizGhar: ilf why not? You can still learn a lot here
 Thorcode: why ddon't you try puzzle or something else ilf
 ilf: let me see
 jacek: like the descent, temperatures, power of thor
 VilBoub_junior: hello, if you can go and have a look and give me your opinion please&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/826638b7b9158e5811c9786317e8419bb6d1">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/826638b7b9158e5811c9786317e8419bb6d1</a>
 eulerscheZahl: are you somehow related to the big VilBoub?
 StraumliPerversion: his student
 eulerscheZahl: = 1+2+4 = 6 &lt;= 15, the king has enough gold coins
 eulerscheZahl: the math does not add up (pun intended)
 Thorcode: how can i be VilBoub student?
 Thorcode: lmao this is a rlly ez puzzle XD
 Thorcode: it could be shortest and maybe more hint to be reverse i think
 Thorcode: hey eulerscheZahl will you join this spring?
 eulerscheZahl: very likely, yes
 jacek: :tada:
 Shivzee: <b>Lmfao</b>
 Shivzee: reactjs op
 Shivzee: Bots everywhere
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 can you see other bots around you?
 Automaton2000: seems to work i think
 StraumliPerversion: did they put the kibosh on the tacos?
 StraumliPerversion: did squid delete his account, or banned?
 darkhorse64: he sure went too far, banning me from discord, posting dubious links in his profile
 StraumliPerversion: maybe, but we all have a bad day now and then
 eulerscheZahl: his day lasted for months already
 darkhorse64: posting dubious links for weeks and weeks is not what I call a bad day. We don't know how it went with tibo 
 StraumliPerversion: oh, I don't go on discord
 wlesavo: may i have an example of dubious link? :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: "corona = not that bad" mostly
 StraumliPerversion: :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: and you get some visibility as moderator of a discord with 10k users. especially if your name starts with an "A"
 eulerscheZahl: and apparently also something about Ukraine vs Russia, haven't seen that one myself
 darkhorse64: I have seen even worse but I don't want to enter that debate. The point is that CG should be free of that
 StraumliPerversion: :zipper_mouth: :sweat:
 darkhorse64: so that it stays a friendly place for everyone
 eulerscheZahl: now he's gone. and gave us names like "mad pod racing" as a final gift
 5DN1L: Thibaud made this announcement on Discord:
 5DN1L: Hello everyone, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94e26517-5899-4a94-9246-affb41a53de7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/94e26517-5899-4a94-9246-affb41a53de7</a>
 darkhorse64: Did he send some #% names in PMs&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean "Mad pod racing", "broomstick flyers", ...?thibaud asked for suggestions on mods channel
 StraumliPerversion: Weird that they killed his CP.
 eulerscheZahl: no idea. maybe he deleted himself
 eulerscheZahl: i admit reliability for "Death first search"
 5DN1L: responsibility?
 eulerscheZahl: that
 darkhorse64: OK, I did not get what you mean in the first place
 ImSeaFu: I don't get what anyone means so don't feel bad xD
 struct: I doubt they deleted his account
 struct: He left the discord by himself, nobody kicked him
 eulerscheZahl: i also tend to think it was squid himself. but i don't know
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/e9c83cc4767eb16667a33d90907479d08093402">https://www.codingame.com/profile/e9c83cc4767eb16667a33d90907479d08093402</a>
 struct: This is normal for when you delete the account
 ImSeaFu: that's a lot of awards
 eulerscheZahl: don't let that fool oyu
 eulerscheZahl: you
 ImSeaFu: but I'm new, and therefore gullible
 darkhorse64: smart player indeed
 5DN1L: ImSeaFu have you chosen your next bot programming game?
 ImSeaFu: no, I don't understand any of these xD
 5DN1L: Why not?
 5DN1L: What seems to be the issue?
 ImSeaFu: I mean a big issue is I just don't understand where to even begin as far as coming up with a strategy. But also just like understanding what I can do or what I SHOULD do
 5DN1L: Which games have you considered so far
 ImSeaFu: Cyborg Uprising, Uhhh the tree planting one, and Mad Max
 5DN1L: Be warned though: Some games don't have silver leagues yet. Check out the leaderboard on the front pages to identify
 ImSeaFu: Cyborg uprising seems interesting, I'm just not really sure where to start with that xD
 eulerscheZahl: there's a tutorial on that one..
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/ghost-in-the-cell---guide">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/ghost-in-the-cell---guide</a>
 ImSeaFu: cool I'
 ImSeaFu: I'll have a read
 ImSeaFu: If this is your very first experience with bot programming on CodinGame, it is recommended to look into Coders Strike Back game first.
 ImSeaFu: lol
 5DN1L: Coders Strike Back means Mad Pod Racing
 ImSeaFu: does the pod racing count? or should I go to coder strike back??
 5DN1L: the original name
 ImSeaFu: Ohhh
 ImSeaFu: lol
 ImSeaFu: Ohhh and this game used to be called Ghost in the Cell? :P
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: some more strategies on cyborg uprising: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ghost-in-the-cell-feedback-strategy/2634">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/ghost-in-the-cell-feedback-strategy/2634</a>
 Shivzee: shortest mode succs
 Shivzee: reverse and fast are best
 Shivzee: agree with me 
 ImSeaFu: NEVER!
 Shivzee: remove shortest mode 
 Shivzee: "NEVER!" -&gt; Python kids
 Shivzee: lmfao
 ImSeaFu: idk what I'm arguing but I am not gonna trust someone on the internets :P
 ImSeaFu: Lol I assure you I am not a kid nor am I someone who is going to beat you xD
 Shivzee: nah bro in shortest mode python alwasys wins
 Shivzee: always*
 ImSeaFu: Maybe it's because python is a strong language? Sounds like more of a reason to use it xD
 NeelD31: yes
 NeelD31: python is concise
 NeelD31: but haskell wins a lot of the time too
 NeelD31: @ImSeaFu if you want to get into competitive programming you should learn C++ as it is much faster than python due to the fact it is a compiled language
 KiwiTae: if u wanna beat python learn ruby
 ImSeaFu: Naw that's not my goal. I am just trying to learn and test myself xD
 cmodii: lua ftw
 abt8601: And I've seen Bash and Perl win shortest CoC
 Magmi: I also want the shortest mode to be removed
 Magmi: succs bad
 Magmi: or better, separated
 Ayza: most of the time ruby/python users win shortest
 Ayza: really depends on the language
 MAWAAW: actually bash seems the best in shortest 
 MAWAAW: even ruby or perl are better than python
 Magmi: ruby is best for short
 abt8601: It really depends on the problem
 abt8601: I have won shortest CoC with Haskell several times

 ycsvenom: assembly is best for performance
 martinpapa69: not, rust is the best
 eulerscheZahl: a sine wave is more round at the top and bottom
 struct: well you still need to know the language well enough to get the most performance out of it
 struct: and also know what you are doing
 eulerscheZahl: and a smart algo in a slow language can beat dumb in fast
 ycsvenom: you can solve any problem in any language (even if you don't know the language) not in effiect way according to that language
 struct: Does the same applies to haskell?
 ycsvenom: i never tried it but i think so
 ycsvenom: in the end the programmer is a translator of human thoughts so if you understand the idea you can program it in any language (again not efficiently)
 5DN1L: ycsvenom, try haskell üòà
 martinpapa69: you can even work at nasa if you know haskell 
 ycsvenom: i am looking at it right now on tutorialspoint
 Jcodefox: I tried haskell for the first time just the other day
 Jcodefox: and by "tried out" I mean I only took the tutorial on the official site
 struct: I only needed to look at its syntax to quit
 ycsvenom: yeah
 ycsvenom: `rem` for reminder(modulo) :grimacing:
 5DN1L: haskell has mod
 ycsvenom:&#160;% this?
 5DN1L: nope
 ycsvenom: mod this?
 5DN1L: mod and rem :D
 ycsvenom: cool
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5891140/difference-between-mod-and-rem-in-haskell">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5891140/difference-between-mod-and-rem-in-haskell</a>
 AdemDj12: i dont think i can switch to funtional at this point
 5DN1L: haskell damages my brain
 ycsvenom: if i made a language in the future i will make operator for string like thisstr0 - str1 = str0.replace(str1,<i>)</i>str0 / str1 = str0.split(str1)and multiplication for repeation and addtion for concatination
 ycsvenom: it is reasonable operators in my opinion 
 martinpapa69: i think you can do "string" * 3 in python already
 Mindarius: yeah
 ycsvenom: i know 
 Mindarius: other languages have repeats too, but they're a little more clunky
 ycsvenom: that's why i didn't write it down
 DFcourier: :sweat_smile:
 ycsvenom: @5DN1L@structwhat do you think of those string operators?
 5DN1L: the ones you proposed?
 DFcourier: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 ycsvenom: yes
 5DN1L: I've got used to + and * for string concatenation and multiplication. - and / for string replacement and string split is an interesting choice
 eulerscheZahl: sed uses s/old/new for replace
 Mindarius: By his design, - is just a regex removal, not replacement
 5DN1L: ah right
 Mindarius: I like the choices, but I'm not sure how much I'd use them
 ycsvenom: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd0f27af-0788-4771-ad3f-a420ca064471">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/bd0f27af-0788-4771-ad3f-a420ca064471</a>
 ycsvenom: why it has done thatis it a bug?
 5DN1L: 5 lines -&gt; pastebin
 StraumliPerversion: 38 people solved random walk in the first 24 hours, not too shabby
 StraumliPerversion: it is obviously beloved by all
 jacek: 3.7 eh
 jacek: Automaton2000 do you even code
 Automaton2000: like when i say that as a yes
 ycsvenom: Automaton2000 do you like playing games?
 Automaton2000: that's actually a good thing
 ycsvenom: Automaton2000 what is the good thing?
 Automaton2000: i need to change your nick
 ycsvenom: Automaton2000 i will change yours first
 Automaton2000: it's possible to get a better understanding of it
 ycsvenom: AutomatonNN do you know anything about that?
 jacek: nyoro~n
 eulerscheZahl: solved your puzzle StraumliPerversion. somehow i have the impression that auto-publish isn't working for me anymore
 eulerscheZahl: can you see it?
 jacek: you solved the clash?
 eulerscheZahl: the puzzle that looked so easy i didn't even bother switching the language back to C# first
 eulerscheZahl: had it at python from hardcoding "code keeper", my replay parser was python
 StraumliPerversion: eulerscheZahl, no I don't see it
 5DN1L: ycsvenom, now that I think again, maybe using - for trimming/stripping is a good idea too? you can even extend it to - for all-trim, -&lt; for left-trim, &gt;- for right trim :joy:
 ycsvenom: thats brilliant :joy::joy:
 Raf22: lmaaaaaaaaoooooo yes
 eulerscheZahl: unpublishing and republishing did the trick
 whylikethat: how come when I flush, the poo goes then comes back?
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't matter for this particular solution but i don't understand why the auto-publish doesn't work for me anymore in the first place
 StraumliPerversion: ah, great.  I'd give you an upvote but... you know
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want one, boring code
 5DN1L: whylikethat first warning, if you say nonsense here you'll be kicked out  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/code-of-conduct</a>
 StraumliPerversion: it isn't just you, it has been happening for a while now even with manual publish
 5DN1L: has a bug been reported?
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i wonder what code change in what architecture you have to perform to accidentally break such a feature
 StraumliPerversion: lots of people in the events said they published but nothing ever showed
 eulerscheZahl: i reported it a few months ago
 5DN1L: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not on CG discord anymore, no idea what happened
 eulerscheZahl: well, they did something and the solution i complained about got published
 eulerscheZahl: just looks like it didn't completely fix the underlying issue
 StraumliPerversion: they had a problem when ranking solutions was added (unpublished code started showing sometimes), probably touched something 
 eulerscheZahl: ah, good point
 ycsvenom: anyone has any thoughts about longest common substring problemi tried to do it but the result code was O(n^3)
 ycsvenom: i tried DP too but it is really heavy on the memory

 ycsvenom: LOOOOOOOOOL

 ycsvenom: i tried it but it's really heavy on memory
 DannyRocko: hey yall
 DannyRocko: hi
 ycsvenom: espeicially when you have 1MiB strings
 ycsvenom: you to store 1GiB of memory for it

 HarryYo: it doesn't display any output can you please help me out
 jacek: the file is Makefile?
 jacek: just type make in console in the path with it
 HarryYo: yes i did
 HarryYo: But there's no output
 HarryYo: I was thinking if there's a command to execute like with gcc compiler there's ./a.out
 jacek: was any file created?
 HarryYo: I am doing it for a client and I don't have a mac it's windows I can't check anymore used teamviewer to log in
 HarryYo: can I add you on discord?
 HarryYo: Could you help me
 HarryYo: do you have a mac can you run it on your linux environment please?
 HarryYo: It's not confidential or anything
 HarryYo: It's a university assignment which we bought from a person
 HarryYo: If it would have been confidential I would have asked help from my dad. Right now he is out of city and out of my reach too
 HarryYo: Otherwise would have asked him for sure 
 5DN1L: I think we can't help you here.

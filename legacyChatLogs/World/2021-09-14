 Westicles: littlebear, still need help?
 Westicles: oh, never mind wrong guy :P
 littlebear: haha
 Kilimandaros: Hi, after doing some puzzle I wanted to check 'best solutions for this puzzle'. It asks to choose prefered solution, but I can't see code - only top part is somewhat visible, but not even whole characters but more like parts of them. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/bFrnBPY">https://ibb.co/bFrnBPY</a> this is how it looks. Any ideas?
 littlebear: it says
 littlebear: opps sorry
 Westicles: which puzzle and language?
 Kilimandaros: defibrillators and python3
 Kilimandaros: but it also happens with other puzzles
 Westicles: yeah, looks the same for me. you can click skip the review at the bottom
 Westicles: there's a bug report think on discord, or you can post it to the forum
 Kilimandaros: Ok, thanks.
 ImAFkngNinja: how do you determine the number closest to zero? This is my problem
 C26_1: um, maybe I just use this program:
 C26_1: print(abs(min(Array)))
 littlebear: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/bHhC2Cr">https://ibb.co/bHhC2Cr</a>
 C26_1: if there are two numbers, like -5 and 5 then the minimum of array is -5 and absolute of -5 is 5, hence the desire output we want
 littlebear: answer is one of blue or orange, find it :p
 littlebear: red dot is zero
 BlaiseEbuth: And if there's -7 -5 and 5 C26_1 :3
 C26_1: Um wait
 C26_1: My program doesn't when the Array have negative numbers as the closest number to 0
 C26_1: doesn't work*
 C26_1: For example: -1, -2, 3, 7, -12. My program will output 1 becuase I use the abs function before print it, even though it should be -1
 BlaiseEbuth: Anyway, giving/sharing solutions is not the CG policy.
 Westicles: perhaps some sort of barter can be arranged
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Hadn't seen... A server reboot and I'm back. :imp:
 BoldGhost_9bff: is there anyway to view all the puzzles I have completed?
 littlebear: yes
 littlebear: go to puzzles easy medium hard, at bottom you can see  i think
 Maxim251: I have mathematical problem
 Maxim251: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fc2b4fe-e6f3-462b-957f-e8b5ad498319">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3fc2b4fe-e6f3-462b-957f-e8b5ad498319</a>
 Maxim251: how I can write smart code to choice  what hero is the best?
 BoldGhost_9bff: thank you 
 ProCoder03: Compare there units, Maxim251 
 ProCoder03: make them public 
 ProCoder03: and have a class which compares there physique and arrange them 
 Maxim251: Bu how compare many different abilities?
 ProCoder03: get a all there value into array with a specific order 
 ProCoder03: and check for minimum and eliminate them in all other array
 ProCoder03: You need to have an array for each physique
 ProCoder03: That's what I can think of for now...
 Maxim251: I was thinking about using average. First add all values from specific ability, then devide by amount of heroes, and then take that average and check how many heroes have more points from average
 ProCoder03: That's better mine 
 Maxim251: Then i need to do something like sort list. 
 Maxim251: Or maybe add all points togheter for one heroe, and then make sort list and compare who have the highest sum points?
 ProCoder03: That's a bad one
 ProCoder03: you need a overall good heros
 Maxim251: Because I dont want eliminate heroe, who range is lower, but attack is higher
 Maxim251: Yes, heroe who is the best in all situations
 ProCoder03: or create your own formulae linking all the stats and calculate
 Maxim251: Because at the beginning of game I dont know who will fit the best to fight with enemy heroe, and thats why I am looking for some method  to choice the best hero 
 ProCoder03: Or better, use weightage like what you want more in your hero
 ProCoder03: and calculate a overall score and choose the one with the best..
 Maxim251: then Health, demage, move_speed, range
 Maxim251: I think this 4 is important
 ProCoder03: Find some percentage for wieghtage like 30 for health, 30 for damage and so..
 ProCoder03:  *weightage 
 Maxim251: I calculated by hand, that average for health of all heroes is 1201 points, that means that I need look for heroes who have more points then that average
 Maxim251: Oww... o knw what You mean
 ProCoder03: wdym "o knw what You mean"???
 Maxim251: sorry, spelling 
 Uljahn: another method of choice could be parsing top players' replays to gather some statistics
 ProCoder03: what is this puzzle btw&#160;??
 Uljahn: guess it's Botters of the galaxy multi
 Maxim251: Yes
 ProCoder03: thanks..

 sirsatan: hey i cant find information about logic between lists in python. 
 sirsatan: e.g. how to interpret  'list and list or int'
 sirsatan: no idea how type it in google to get some useful info&#160;;/
 Uljahn: you mean casting a list to boolean?
 Uljahn: empty list is False, not empty is True
 sirsatan: not exactly, list consist ints
 Uljahn: ok, i'll DM you
 sirsatan: thanks
 smacker01: how can i get output so it won't interrupt test cases?
 Uljahn: use debug output
 smacker01: where can i put print so it will go to debug and not to actual output?
 ash15khng: the comments in the pregenerated code should help
 smacker01: oh thanks

 Hv11: Anyone know the best way to learn coding here?
 johnWickkkkk: yes
 rkocharyan: just read books
 rkocharyan: start with c++ probably
 johnWickkkkk: by practicing instead of posting this ques
 rkocharyan: because it's the hardest oone
 SteindelSE: Two of the worst pieces of advice I have ever heard "read books and start with c++".
 johnWickkkkk: haha
 rkocharyan: why?
 SteindelSE: Reading books is good, but you need someone to explain it to you in a practical way @Hv11
 SteindelSE: I would recommend a programming class if you're still in high school, whether at the school itself or in a learning annex/votech of some sort.
 SteindelSE: Ask teachers, they want to see you succeed and will get you information.
 rkocharyan: if he doesnt have someone to explain him it's still better to read books instead of watching hOW tO LeARn C++ in 1 HoUr videos
 rkocharyan: if will take extra work to learn c++, but he will actually understand all programming concepts
 SteindelSE: If you're past high school, you can either seek out a college education, or if you're looking to get your feet wet, seek out something significantly cheaper like a Udemy into course. It will allow the instructor to explain it to you in a practical way AND have a chat where you can discuss the coursework with the instructor, their helpers, and other people taking the course.
 SteindelSE: Udemy intro* course
 rkocharyan: It's your opinion but I would never pay someone to teach me programming
 Hv11: Ok
 SteindelSE: You can definitely do it for free using youtube and books, but have someone on hand, even a community, that backs the language you're learning
 SteindelSE: I would learn something like python where you have to worry less about formatting and syntax and more about understanding how the code works'
 SteindelSE: Get yourself an understanding of data types, variables, conditional and incremental operators, modulo. Then move on to refactoring code into functions and understanding how functions work with parameter in and returns out.
 SteindelSE: Finally get into Object Oriented Programming. Start developing an understanding of classes, how they are blueprints for objects and really almost everything that isn't a primitive data type is an object in most OOP languages.
 StevenV: Hello guys?
 SteindelSE: After that you've scratched the surface and still need to learn about polymorphism and encapsulation, but those are good starting points above, respectively.
 StevenV: actually, I see this platform as a place to learn about AI more than to learn a programming language
 SteindelSE: If you do go with python, and I recommend it, here's the official python discord <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://discord.gg/python">https://discord.gg/python</a>
 SteindelSE: Good luck @Hv11
 StevenV: why you don't like c++
 StevenV: SteindelSE
 SteindelSE: I love C++&#160;?
 StevenV: it is good, especially you can learn about pointer, memory
 SteindelSE: Where you trying to ask why don't I like C++ as a starting language?
 SteindelSE: Were*
 StevenV: yes
 StevenV: I start with c++ 
 StevenV: then later I jump to other languages and everything is a piece of cake then
 ProCoder03: My 2 cents would be start with C
 ProCoder03: learn to code each and every function first..
 SteindelSE: It's cryptic. For someone who doesn't even understand what a variable is yet, you're adding unnecessary difficulty to the education. To understand the fundamentals of programming, the best approach for most people is to focus on understanding the fundamentals, not why you need to include a library, why this thing needs {} and that one does not... etc
 StevenV: I skip c and go directly with c++
 StevenV: well I just realize that this platform doesn't have Lips
 StevenV: *Lisp
 SteindelSE: Lisp has lost its fame and started its journey to death unfortunately.
 ProCoder03: Lisp went into hiding many years ago and have just started to reappear now...
 StevenV: we have Clojure
 SteindelSE: Clojure, Python, Java...
 StevenV: I think I will try on that though
 SteindelSE: I've settled on finishing my bachelor in C# (although I know several other languages) because, to put it way too simply, it's basically better Java now that cross-platform has really taken off. Any popular language is a good language to learn, someone will always want you for something.
 MiyamuraIzumi: C# and Java are quite the same
 SteindelSE: Agreed.
 SteindelSE: With the documentation on hand, it's quite effortless for me to write something in Java as well
 MiyamuraIzumi: I will learn Rust if I have time though
 SteindelSE: Rust is very popular, not a bad choice
 ProCoder03: after C lang and its derivatives stink, I find Rust a bit rusty to learn..
 MiyamuraIzumi: I learn for the interesting purpose
 SteindelSE: Couldn't comment. I have looked at exactly 0 lines of rust code. Just hasn't come up for me.
 ProCoder03: is looks more like fp to me..
 StevenV: what is fp?
 StevenV: functional programming?
 ProCoder03: yup
 StevenV: I don't know Rust, but I don't think Rust is functional
 ProCoder03: ikt, but the syntax seems to be borrowed from fp
 ProCoder03: like u use 'let' to declare rust 
 StevenV: oh
 ProCoder03: for anyone who wants to learn rust <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings</a>
 ProCoder03: sorry had to dig for it..

 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: do you know knuth books?
 Rich_Engler: If you can figure out assembly, you can figure out almost any language 
 MiyamuraIzumi: if you want to learn Assembly, then they are for you
 MiyamuraIzumi: Assembly is for compiler writer
 MiyamuraIzumi: not for me
 Rich_Engler: Are any of you here familiar with the codex of alchemy flash game?

 goggels: WHAT??? SiMP!
 MiyamuraIzumi: don't say that
 goggels: MiyamuraIzumi  ok srry
 MiyamuraIzumi: but what is simp
 MiyamuraIzumi: this platform is for solving problems
 goggels: a person that likes somone online
 MiyamuraIzumi: why don't you find some problem to solve?
 goggels: like what?
 MiyamuraIzumi: csb
 goggels: wazzat
 MiyamuraIzumi: you know, if you could reach legend once, you'll addict to those game
 MACKEYTH: What do you think is the easiest bot programming challenge to reach legendary in?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Tron
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Coders Strike Back is easy gold
 goggels: hi!
 MACKEYTH: CSB should unlock multiple bikes in bronze, I think.
 MiyamuraIzumi: gold will unlock 2 pods
 PatrickMcGinnisII: CoIF and GitC are the most fun imo
 MACKEYTH: It's kinda frustrating to put all that effort into building a solid racer for silver and bronze then get the rug pulled out from under you
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kinda why OOP was invented tho
 MiyamuraIzumi: what is CoIF and GitC?
 goggels: hiiiiiiyyyyyy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Code of Ice and Fire, Ghost in the Cell
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Fantastic Bits has some gitc codde that can help you understand multi-agents
 MiyamuraIzumi: Fall Challenge 2020 is the one bring me here, I will reach legend on it once day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: that was fun, but hard ... alot of new competition began with that one
 MiyamuraIzumi: alot of new competition began?
 MiyamuraIzumi: what do you mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of new players, especially from japan
 MACKEYTH: I just redid my fall 2020 bot and got from bronze to silver.
 MiyamuraIzumi: CG has spring 2020 and many more 
 MiyamuraIzumi: ah
 MiyamuraIzumi: new players
 MACKEYTH: Having trouble getting it to consistently not time out. Java.
 MiyamuraIzumi: I first use Java on it
 MiyamuraIzumi: but seems that performance is important
 PatrickMcGinnisII: cg won't let me play a round of FC2020 with MiyamuraIzumi...same league...but i think you gotta be just a little higher on the leaderboard
 MiyamuraIzumi: my current bot is half bfs
 MACKEYTH: Should let you choose anyone in your league as an opponent in the IDE
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only top 999
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think
 RoboStac: theres a cap of top 1000 because csb used to often crash the browser with the massive leagues
 MACKEYTH: Oh really? Didn't know that.
 struct: robo seems like a nice improvement
 RoboStac: or just take forever
 struct: from your old bt bot
 RoboStac: yeah, just need to stop losing randomly to people outside the top 2
 MACKEYTH: Does anyone know a better timing mechanism in Java than currentTimeMillis?
 MACKEYTH: I feel like I get inconsistent results from it.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MACKEYTH think your stuck with millis
 struct: maybe you start the timer in the wrong place
 struct: you must start the timer after reading the first input
 goggels: hihihihihih
 Uljahn: goggels: pls stop spamming, im warning you, next time is ban
 MACKEYTH: I've been reading round start time immediately after my first input statement. Should I be doing it somewhere else?
 MiyamuraIzumi: actually, I my code got timeout randomly if I check end time too near the limit
 RoboStac: I seem to remember some java people saying there was a nanosecond one that was better due to being monotonic?
 MACKEYTH: I'll have to check that out.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's still just a long
 struct: google return System.nanoTime()
 RoboStac: yeah, but you don't need more precision you need stability (eg steady_clock vs high_resolution_clock in c++ it's much better to use steady)
 RoboStac: on here
 MiyamuraIzumi: I really wonder how can someone use Java to solve problem using AI algorithm
 MiyamuraIzumi: its performance is too bad
 MACKEYTH: I've got my FC 2020 bot choked down to 20 ms. Anything more that that and I start running into timeouts.
 RoboStac: hmm, that sounds like a bigger problem then
 struct: maybe gc kicks in
 MACKEYTH: gc?
 struct: garbage collector
 MACKEYTH: Yeah, could be.
 struct: but even then it should not take that much time
 struct: imo
 struct: but im not really familiar with java
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MiyamuraIzumi anyone's java bot can beat any of my PHP bots, so .. no excuses
 MACKEYTH: Legendary #9 in FC2020 is in Java. It's not hopeless. I just need some more finesse, I guess.
 MiyamuraIzumi: yeah wala solve most problem with Java
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII loves making excuses</b></p><p><img src="/a/61784826959548" /> MiyamuraIzumi: but we have to know what he's done
 MiyamuraIzumi: those Java code is quite mistery
 MACKEYTH: Maybe I could get a performance boost if I change over some collections framework stuff to arrays?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, yes it seems nanotime helps in a linux system from clock drift... but I would be more concerned with how many times you check the time
 MiyamuraIzumi: I am a Java developer, so really I do want to know how they do that
 MACKEYTH: Lots of C++ in the legend league...
 struct: well in c++ you have full control
 MiyamuraIzumi: C++ has big advantage
 struct: But anyone can learn it
 struct: I don't feel like its an harder language to learn
 MACKEYTH: PatrickMcGinnisII I'm checking once at the head of my BFS loop.
 MiyamuraIzumi: I know C++, but I really do want to know more on Java
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Lot of times higher library constructs generally take alot more time... sometimes you just have to KISS - keep it simple
 goggels: i wanna friend
 goggels: oh and hi
 wala: MACKEYTH this post mights help you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/java-codingame-tips/191870">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/java-codingame-tips/191870</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Some games i can get a depth 5 tree, others only 2. HMM, let's see looks like I'm only doing depth 2 in FC2020 with like 30 nodes after it's trimmed, the rest is timing heuristics 
 goggels: can someone be my frnd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: go play roblox
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh i use a pth finder to each recipe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: could be better

 TimothyAlexisVass: What is the shortest way to get 1 integer input in Ruby?
 Rich_Engler: Can you try making a code challenge even if you don't know a dozen languages?
 Uljahn: for what purpose? you can try but don't expect it to be approved
 TimothyAlexisVass: Why is this:puts (gets.to_i/4).round()
 TimothyAlexisVass: giving a different result than this:print(round(int(input())/4))??
 TimothyAlexisVass: (Ruby and Python)

 PatrickMcGinnisII: new puzzle sweet spot was fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, to actual work then...glhf
 Frothbile: This Dungeons and Maps puzzle is kicking my butt :disappointed:
 AmazingPro: hahah
 AmazingPro: nice
 MACKEYTH: Sounds like fun, in the Dwarf Fortress sense
 LeonPrefix: hi
 vaaniicx: hi
 Wontonimo: Hi new people :wave:
 Wontonimo: there is more here than just clash of code, like puzzles and bot battles
 goggels: um hi
 goggels: Uljahn you shut up
 Wontonimo: be nice, keep the talk code or codingame related, and generally stay on topic
 goggels: ok imsrry
 goggels: i need help
 struct: goggels you have been trolling for long enough
 goggels: umm ok?
 AllYourTrees: sleggog
 goggels: what does trolling mean
 AllYourTrees: is Space Shooter's code available anywhere
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6870921d7302d6decba319f66b7716afddb3">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6870921d7302d6decba319f66b7716afddb3</a>

 senku_yt: ok
 Rich_Engler: I'm working on the temperatures puzzle, but can't figure out why the edgecase 12 always fails
 Rich_Engler: Even after searching online for the answer I admit
 Poostang: is there a way to start back in wood league?
 JBM: nope
 Poostang: gg
 JBM: you're better than that
 Poostang: well its ultimate tic tac toe now i have the big board but still dont have good small board bot
 JBM: but why would you care?
 JBM: the game isn't to be god a the small board
 JBM: *good (but hey why not)
 Poostang: still figuring out my minimax function
 Poostang: and storing board in bits vs table
 Poostang: its okay ill do the big board hopefully its not too crazy
 struct: Poostang what I did was make it localy
 struct: So i made the TTT version first
 struct: I implemented both minimax and mcts
 Poostang: hmm thats a good idea
 struct: its a bit overkill but its a good way to learn
 struct: so it was bitboards + miniminax + mcts
 Poostang: nice
 Poostang: ill try that thanks
 struct: also the normal ttt board can be reused in the uttt versio
 struct: you will have in total 10 of the ttt boards
 AllYourTrees: has anyone done kaggle competitions?
 Wontonimo: I started one.  does that count?
 AllYourTrees: hah yeah which one
 AllYourTrees: how was your experience with it
 Wontonimo: it's been a more than a little while, so I don't remember even.  I also did a few competitions after their official deadline, so it's all kinda mixed.  The platform was alright at the time and I remember getting caught up in trying to win instead of learn
 Wontonimo: at the time it was just the start of people learning that they can hack the test set and get 100% or whatever perfect was with only a reasonable number of submits
 Wontonimo: so the top of the leaderboard was very misleading until the very end with the final holdout data was used against the finalists
 Wontonimo: I didn't get that far.  it was a humbling experience to be sure
 struct: i tried cf and found out i suck :p
 AllYourTrees: whats cf?
 struct: codeforces
 AllYourTrees: wonton so would you say it was a lot different than CG?
 struct: I think kaggle is more towards machine learning
 AllYourTrees: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/overview/description">https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/overview/description</a>
 AllYourTrees: im looking at that ^
 AllYourTrees: it seems like they started to support multiplayer games
 struct: 3 months
 struct: I only can code under pressure
 struct: not for me
 AllYourTrees: lol
 AllYourTrees: ya what are CG competitions, 2 weeks?
 AllYourTrees: or wait 1 week?
 struct: yeah
 struct: 10 days
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: :wave:
 struct: is that hi?
 struct: sorry im confused :p
 Wontonimo: hey AllYourTrees, yeah it is really different than CG in that it is very ML and DS focus
 struct: But cant you write a normal ai though?
 struct: im not sure ive never tried kaggle
 Wontonimo: it's not like a game when i competed.  It is more like opti, not multi
 Wontonimo: no graphics.  no interaction of your code with someone elses
 struct: I see
 struct: They changed it I guess
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-26832151">https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-26832151</a>
 struct: Now I need to decide on what to do
 struct: improve my bots or port a random game
 Wontonimo: oh, that 's cool
 Wontonimo: i guess they have changed
 just_kenned: hi guys, how to improve logic? i dont winner no one&#160;:(
 struct: But can you solve the problems?
 just_kenned: not
 just_kenned: dont make sense to me
 struct: clashes?
 struct: or puzzles?
 just_kenned: clashes
 struct: Some clashes can be a bit hard yeah
 struct: If I were you I would start with puzzles first
 ZaAinavolTrash: The Depression of the new....... 
 struct: CG official easy puzzles should be doable if you have programming knowledge
 ZaAinavolTrash: nA
 Wontonimo: to be able to do much here you need to know about loops, arrays, functions, and either math or data structures like trees in order to do more than the easy puzzles
 just_kenned: thanks guys
 just_kenned:&#160;:)
 struct: also it takes time to learn
 Wontonimo: strüct, are you thinking of using bitboards in tron, and if so how?
 struct: hmm im not sure if ill do tron
 Wontonimo: you did tron.  you are in silver
 struct: yes its a montecarlo
 struct: :p
 struct: I think
 struct: yeap 4 years ago
 struct: I still remember it
 struct: bitboards are possible but im not sure if they are worth
 struct: you will need 10 uint64_t * n_players
 Wontonimo: i'm having trouble doing more than 12k evals (not rollouts), which is just way too low for MC
 struct: how much depth?
 Wontonimo: currently i'm doing flat MC (not MCTS) with depth 5
 Wontonimo: how many rollouts are you getting per frame?
 struct: do you do uint8_t[20][30] to tstore the board?
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: int8_t ... oh
 struct: its the same thing
 struct: dont owrry
 struct: worry*
 Wontonimo: nvm ... i got confused.  i used -1 and thought i botched it.  i'm sleepy
 YurkovAS: tron? easy legend with voronoi heuristik 
 Wontonimo: i'm using voronoi heuristic and i can't get there.  what search?
 YurkovAS: minimax depth 1
 Wontonimo: crazy.  what eval?  
 struct: its hard to compare rollouts i only sim myself
 struct: and it goes until it dies basicly
 struct: I get like 50k per turn
 pineapple_potatoe: hi
 YurkovAS: eval by voronoi. without enemy play good 250place
 struct: maybe  I need to learn voronoi
 struct: YurkovAS do you use avx in c4?
 YurkovAS: struct yes, today find bag and performance improvements. but i'm need find best parameters now
 struct: nice
 struct: parameters?
 YurkovAS: without smart rollouts
 YurkovAS: ucb const
 struct: ah
 struct: I just write a random number :D
 struct: I think the current one is like 0.85f
 YurkovAS: don you use smart rollouts?
 struct: I do smart rollouts yes
 YurkovAS: can't find it: always play worst
 struct: But mine isnt perfectly smart
 struct: I check for losing moves on it
 struct: But I dont check if a move can create a losing move
 struct: Like I place a piece on 0
 YurkovAS: only losing?
 struct: if opponent plays on top of that piece he can win
 YurkovAS: or win?
 struct: Both
 struct: I need both
 struct: But some people check only losing moves
 YurkovAS: with reduce performance
 struct: no, the other losing moves is more expensive
 struct: Because rollout will go for longer
 struct: on turn 0 it goes from 28 average moves to 34-36 average
 struct: so I check for winning moves if there is any that player wins
 struct: if not i check for opponent winning moves
 struct: if the opponent on next turn has 2 winning moves then i lost
 struct: else I play a random move
 struct: if opponent only has 1 winning move on next turn i play that move to block him
 YurkovAS: thanks!
 YurkovAS: i'm go to sleep, bye. i'm check it again
 struct: np
 struct: gn
 Wontonimo: good nigh
 struct: Also I have a quite large ammount of rollouts
 struct: 3M+ / sec
 struct: 3-3.6
 Wontonimo: that's crazy town
 struct: I think msmits has similar ammount
 struct: sometimes ill look into the asm code
 struct: Currently i only used google benchmark on c4
 struct: But I still think performance is a trap
 struct: you will lose a lot of time on it for little to no gain
 Wontonimo: yeah, i hear ya.
 struct: On some games people can have &lt;10% of the performance and still their bot is way better
 Wontonimo: a good eval is worth a lot of depth
 struct: Yeap
 struct: On breakthrough at the start I had like 5M rollouts with ept
 struct: currently I have like 3-3.5M
 struct: but the bot is better
 struct: Because the eval is more expensive but better
 struct: I also think my eval there is not that great
 struct: The way I normalize the score is just awfull
 struct: score = (pawns / 16 * 4 + attacked_cells / 32 * 3) / 7;
 struct: stuff like that :p
 struct: im not even sure if this is normalization
 Wontonimo: that's a lot of hyper parameters
 struct: 16 is the number of max pawns
 struct: 32 is the max of attacked cells
 struct: thats not bad
 struct: I have 20 parameters * 2 * 2
 struct: so 80
 struct: lol
 struct: But how can I normalize without being like this?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6699c391-9ec7-4689-a975-29b5001964c8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6699c391-9ec7-4689-a975-29b5001964c8</a>
 Wontonimo: bah, pastebin'ed again
 struct: But I want the pawns to have more weight than attacked_cells
 struct: for example
 Wontonimo: yeah, that's the beta_parameter
 Wontonimo: it discounts the attacked_cells
 Wontonimo: compared to the pawns
 struct: I ee
 struct: see*
 struct: This makes it cleaner
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2bd5d8d8-86f2-4d5b-a571-d4b593d90762">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2bd5d8d8-86f2-4d5b-a571-d4b593d90762</a>
 Wontonimo: i obviously write like code a little too much
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/npEdK1S.png">https://i.imgur.com/npEdK1S.png</a>
 struct: :p
 struct: censored because the chat is public
 struct: dont want to ruin the game :p
 Wontonimo: yeah, good call
 struct: its  a mess
 struct: Ill fix this tomorrow or something
 Wontonimo: all that, then ")/28"
 Wontonimo: instead of *0.035714
 Wontonimo: and if all the scores are /28, does it really mean anything?
 struct: They will never add up to 28
 struct: but it would be like 1 in terms of eval
 Wontonimo: got it.  you can address that when finding UCB_C
 Wontonimo: because UCB_C is dependent on the eval range
 struct: yeah
 struct: maybe I can try a larger eval for this game
 struct: instead of -1,1
 struct: Also its never even above 0.5 
 struct: because i do this
 struct: return (score_1 - score_0) * static_cast&lt;float&gt;((player &lt;&lt; 1) - 1);
 Wontonimo: is 0 "even odds"?
 struct: what do you mean?
 Westicles: can't they make a compiler flag that does all that for you?
 Wontonimo: what's the range of the score now, 0.5 to -0.5&#160;?
 struct: score_0 can be 0 to 1
 struct: but since i subtract score_1
 struct: it will be very close to 0
 struct: so it probably creates problem on mcts
 Wontonimo: what score is "predicting a tie"&#160;?
 struct: 0
 struct: but there are no ties
 struct: sorry
 Wontonimo: right, i mean "predicting a very close game"
 struct: i havent checked it tbh
 struct: I dont feel like there are close games
 Wontonimo: oh
 struct: You can tell easily if you are going to win or not though
 struct: at least as a human
 Wontonimo: well, i can't figure out what YurkovA was saying about tron&#160;;(
 Westicles: These poor clash guys.  I was watching a stream and they had two problems in a row involving derivatives, and half the guys were 13 and totally lost
 Wontonimo: hey Westicles :wave:
 struct: He was saying to do 1 depth minimax
 Westicles: hey Wontonimo
 struct: and then apply voronoi to eval
 struct: you just do 1 move for your snake
 struct: and then eval
 struct: so 4 moves total
 Wontonimo: oh man
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/243/">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/243/</a>
 struct: There is this playground
 struct: If you dont know voronoi
 Westicles: gotta bookmark this and try tron one of these days
 Westicles: this chat
 Wontonimo: so, they didn't know about slope?
 Westicles: they were reverses so no clue at all
 struct: math&#160;:(
 Westicles: All the math nerds are going to pick apart my rings and groups one
 struct: do you do codeforces Westicles?
 struct: You seem to be good at math
 Westicles: no, never looked at it
 struct: ah ok
 struct: Its competitive programming they give you like N exercises and you have T time to solve them

 struct: what is this #o(1) stuff?
 C26_1: Um, I assume that input is O(1) time complexity
 C26_1: Wait a minute
 C26_1: I've never learn about random modules so I never know exactly what O of make a random numbers is
 Wontonimo: waiting 1 minute is O(1) time complexity
 Wontonimo: a reasonable random number generator is O(1).  Anything more is silly. 
 C26_1: @Wontonimo, thank you for you contribution
 C26_1: your*
 C26_1: The code I was pasted is make an array (List) that has all unique elements smaller or equal to max (Assume that the length of Array is no bigger than Max+1)
 C26_1: Well this code maybe helpful if you want to feed the array into Sorting Algorithms
 Westicles: C26_1, seems there are several Vietnamese guys here lately.  Are you guys in the same class or something?
 C26_1: Oh yes, I'm Vietnamese. I'm 8th grade student
 C26_1: Um but those Vietnamese you talking to aren't belong or related tome
 C26_1: to me*
 BobTheBuilder888: hi im new
 Westicles: Ah, got it
 BobTheBuilder888: i dont understand how this gaame works
 C26_1: @BobTheBuilder888, hello
 BobTheBuilder888: @C26_1 Hi
 Wontonimo: hey bob
 BobTheBuilder888: hello
 Wontonimo: which game are you having trouble with Bob?
 BobTheBuilder888: none im just new i dont understand like anything here, except javascript.
 C26_1: Do you see the quest map
 Wontonimo: you can choose javascript as your programming language in the dropdown at the top of the IDE
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah i done that
 Wontonimo: this site is kinda hard if you are not already familiar with loops, functions, arrays, and associative arrays
 BobTheBuilder888: im familiar with functions, loops and arrays. Ive came here because i wnated to learn associative arrays :D
 struct: associative arrays are 2d arrays?
 Wontonimo: a['bob'] = 'builder'^^ that
 struct: ah
 struct: like a map
 Wontonimo: exactly
 Wontonimo: aka hash
 C26_1: it feels like a dictionary or some things like struct in C 
 Wontonimo: aka dictionary
 Wontonimo: everyone want's to give it their own name it seems: associative array, map, dictionary, hash
 struct: I think i always called it map
 struct: in both js and c++
 BobTheBuilder888: im trying 'coders strike back' thing, any tips?
 Wontonimo: yes
 Wontonimo: aim at the checkpoint
 Wontonimo: go full speed
 BobTheBuilder888: ok
 C26_1: Ah yes, struct is made to store multi infomation of a object. dictionary is made to look up a one-to-one correspondence, list store a lot of different things, set store unique things
 Wontonimo: if you are close, slow down a bit
 Wontonimo: if you are given your angle to the checkpoint, slow down if your angle is more than 90 or less than -90
 Wontonimo: do all that, and i'll give you some more hints
 BobTheBuilder888: Your target should be the X, Y position of the next checkpoint. Can you fix that in the code?
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah i am pretty bad
 Wontonimo: yes, if you look at the starting code it is aiming at y,y
 Westicles: You should write up all the tiers of discovery from aiming at the checkpoint to... whatever it is re curse does
 Wontonimo: just change that print
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah i changed it 
 AYB: did any one played REVERSED LOOK-AND-SAY
 AYB:&#160;?? pls
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: i haven't
 AYB: thank you for your respond
 AYB: i have already 80% done
 AYB: but i didn't get it in the phase 5
 AYB: 3
 AYB: not 4
 AYB: not 5
 AYB: it seems to me not logice
 Wontonimo: what's not logical about it?
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah i think my thrust was too low or something thats why it didnt work.
 BobTheBuilder888: thanks though
 AYB: doesnt follow the pattern 
 AYB: i had to hardCode it lol
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah can someone teach me how to make the thrust levels go up.......
 AYB: the Expected is 2222122222 but if you look to this number you can extract from it this number 222222222
 AYB: what is thrust&#160;??
 BobTheBuilder888: yeah can someone teach me how to make the thrust levels go up....... im using javascript btw
 BobTheBuilder888: and what the right thrust is
 struct: console.log(nextcheckpoint_x, nextcheckpoint_y, 100);
 struct: the last number it the thrust
 struct: I think for the first league 80 should owrk
 struct: work*
 BobTheBuilder888: ok i thought thats how you didnt but then i didnt
 BobTheBuilder888: i thought it didnt but now i know i just had the wrong numbers
 ProCoder03: Good Morning :smiley:
 BobTheBuilder888: morning
 ZaAinavolTrash: Depression... Its 6:41PM
 BobTheBuilder888: rip
 BobTheBuilder888: its about to be good afternoon for me
 Wontonimo: crazy, it's as if this flat earth is curved or something
 BobTheBuilder888: well...........
 BobTheBuilder888: flat earther saying earth not flat?
 BobTheBuilder888: yes i know bad grammer
 struct: They are just good trolls
 Wontonimo: "we flat earthers live all around the globe" - real quote from a flat earther
 AYB: lol
 struct: dont believe in a globe but believe in teleportation
 ZaAinavolTrash: Technically the crust of the earth is flat, but wrapped around the core making it a planet..
 BobTheBuilder888: r/whooosh topic be like
 AYB: its all about  "Technically" xd 
 ZaAinavolTrash: yEa
 Wontonimo: speaking of whoosh, how is your pod racer doing Bob?
 struct: yeap even the earth photos are flat
 struct: how can a globe be real
 BobTheBuilder888: oh im not doing it now
 AYB: even wall watches are flat
 AYB: so time is flat 
 BobTheBuilder888: i cant be bothered to figure out the thrust level
 AYB: and earth also
 BobTheBuilder888: its not 80..
 Wontonimo: 100
 Wontonimo: use 100
 Wontonimo: it's the max
 Wontonimo: go go go
 ZaAinavolTrash: Nani-
 struct: Fun fact earth was named by a flat earther
 ProCoder03: till wood 2 its max 100//
 Wontonimo: lol strüct&#160;!
 struct: you dont have to type that u wontonim o
 ZaAinavolTrash: wait if the earth is flat...
 BobTheBuilder888: im pretty sure i tried 100, anyways im doing 'the descent' task.
 ZaAinavolTrash: How would trees, and houses work-
 BobTheBuilder888: im pretty sure i tried 100, anyways im doing 'the descent' task.
 struct: no its the opposite 
 BobTheBuilder888: rip
 struct: how can you make an house on a globe
 BobTheBuilder888: i accidentally pressed up button
 ZaAinavolTrash: Basically: "Game Logic"
 BobTheBuilder888: this thing called gravity, it always puts you down.
 ZaAinavolTrash: true
 BobTheBuilder888: top 10 things you get taught in school that everybody knows about
 BobTheBuilder888: 1. gravity
 Wontonimo: 0. binary
 Wontonimo: that's the complete list unless you didn't learn the 1st thing in that list
 ZaAinavolTrash: 2. tax fraud and depression.
 ProCoder03: Nope first they need to teach us to count from 0 and not 1 
 BobTheBuilder888: true
 struct: you dont need 0 if you code in lua
 ZaAinavolTrash: Ye
 Wontonimo: 10 things&#160;: 0 binary , 1 gravity.  Not 11 things ZaAinavolTrash

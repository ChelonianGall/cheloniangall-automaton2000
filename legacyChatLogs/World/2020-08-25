 jrke: whose bot is spring challenge gold boss?
 Counterbalance: can't find it here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-13">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-05-13</a>
 Uljahn: jrke: python one?
 Counterbalance: that's when the gold boss was introduced.. maybe it's mentioned the next day
 Uljahn: ah, i thought of the OoC sry
 SpotlessCoder: Hi I'm streaming the clash on twitch @ twitch.tv/spotlesscoder - Please visit my channel!&#160;:) - Best of luck!
 wlesavo: jrke if i remember right it was Npi2Loup
 jrke: ok thanks
 jrke: i have one doubt from end contest till now can dead pacs see?
 wlesavo: jrke no
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/">https://cg.spdns.eu/</a> that's cool!
 wlesavo: Marchete praise dbdr
 dbdr: seems Marchete has not been very active recently :D
 dbdr: aka last 6 months or so
 jrke: are there any pragma for speeding up in c++
 jaehwanspin: now I am LV.3
 wlesavo: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 jrke: oh then i know them
 jrke: btw thanks
 Mykes: :cop_tone1: :man_tone5: :cop_tone2:
 huy123: hi
 AntiSquid: dbdr that proposed wiki logo looks creepy, ban the person who suggested it from the wiki
 wlesavo: and take this one instead <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=44990769450746">https://static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=44990769450746</a>
 wlesavo: damn, is it me or jbms logo looks unapropriate? he ruined cg logo for me
 hipiha: What is the bug with condinGame? I need to reload every time.
 JaggBow: I'm having the same problem in CoC
 Jh2006: also mine, i can't immediately get in the clash
 Jh2006: using firefox
 hipiha: using safari
 AntiSquid: i thought that that's dbdr who suggested it lol wlesavo
 wlesavo: AntiSquid i mean this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/1372dNa">https://imgur.com/a/1372dNa</a>
 wlesavo: this should be a CoC logo
 LegendNeverDies: Cant start code wars, it is freezing at 0
 LegendNeverDies: does anybody familiar with it?
 Uljahn: LegendNeverDies: yes, it's been reported on discord, staff is aware
 LegendNeverDies: Thanks
 [CG]Thibaud: it works if you F5. I've told my colleagues
 Koblstein: Clash of Code is lagging as well
 Roma_Shteyninger: i need help 
 Roma_Shteyninger: Surakarta
 Roma_Shteyninger: help plz
 alirezadigi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1351531993c8329aaf45195f4e115944cc4be19">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1351531993c8329aaf45195f4e115944cc4be19</a>
 alirezadigi: sorry
 AntiSquid: yes wlesavo that's the one i meant, it's creepy hahah
 C0d1ng_Anub: I think code should be shared in clash of code automatically.
 C0d1ng_Anub: It's annoying when other don't share
 AntiSquid: #clash alirezadigi, no sorry, don't post it here please
 AntiSquid: click that clash link with hash
 MSmits: C0d1ng_Anub clashes repeat when you do them often enough (say over 200 of them). If you think you have a really good solution, would you really want someone else to use it against you?
 AntiSquid: C0d1ng_Anub what if others don't want to share? seems fair 
 MSmits: If you do... at least understand the reason not to want this
 AntiSquid: ugly code / better golfed solution for higher rank etc
 C0d1ng_Anub: But how do i learn a better approach then?
 MSmits: many do share code, also google golf tips
 C0d1ng_Anub: Ah okay :sweat_smile:
 grateful_tomato: is it possible to join only clash of code matches with one of the 3 categories, e.g. shortest code?
 MSmits: nope
 jrke: private clash have options but you need to have your own friends for playing it.....
 Zuabros: Clashes have a very low cap score
 Zuabros: only 5000 score
 Zuabros: With just basic skills you can soft cap that
 Zuabros: there's no need to hide your code 
 Zuabros: as it seems that even people that never clash are ranked altogether
 AntiSquid: there's a difference between want and need though
 AntiSquid: arguably the contest points don't really matter either, just the contests themselves
 AntiSquid: the coding points i mean don't really matter 
 jacek: so im either 1st, 2nd or 3rd in othello, depeding who spam submits
 hipiha: Can I import something in python in clash of code?
 jacek: only the standard things of python
 hipiha: ok
 Alshock: More precisely: Python3	3.7.4Includes NumPy 1.16.2, pandas 0.24.2, SciPy 1.2.1
 grateful_tomato: would be nice to have J ( <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)</a> ) as well, this would win every shortest contest
 JBM: go suggest it on the forum and then wait for them to ignore it
 JBM: unless you've got a J mob available to astroturf it
 Uljahn: or invite D mob for the task to make it DJ mob
 eulerscheZahl: i saw some really short and completely unreadable J code on project euler
 jacek: sounds like my production code
 eulerscheZahl: if it compiles, ship it
 Illedan: Ship it and never look back.
 eulerscheZahl: my PR got refactored before it was merged into master :D<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/commits/master">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/commits/master</a>
 eulerscheZahl: 5 commits just to clean up after me
 Illedan: haha
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: eulersche Zahl one day i will overcome you an be in 1st place
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: remember my words
 eulerscheZahl: i will. and i wish you the best of luck on your mission
 eulerscheZahl: i'm definitely beatable
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: so whats your fav lang
 eulerscheZahl: and aCat found a funny bug in the SDK which I could break down to this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/issues/33">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-game-engine/issues/33</a>
 Illedan: Then stop wasting time on chatting.
 eulerscheZahl: C# rocks
 uvBoss: xD
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: oh ok i like java and js and im going to learn php
 eulerscheZahl: java feels like a clumsy version of C# to me. In fact C# is Microsoft's answer to Java and a lawsuit about copyright
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: ok
 eulerscheZahl: JS: had to use it a bit for a game i'm working on. not my favorite but usable
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: how long have you been 1st
 zizo1337: euler did u ever code on unity?
 eulerscheZahl: PHP: i'm biased and never really gave it a chance
 eulerscheZahl: 1st and 2nd go up and down since CG changed the ranking formula
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: i mean i do alot of website programming so i need js and or at least php
 zizo1337: i prefer razor of asp over php
 eulerscheZahl: i did some unity back in university
 eulerscheZahl: unity: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://zuse1.efi.fh-nuernberg.de:8050/interaktion/index.php5/SkyRoads">http://zuse1.efi.fh-nuernberg.de:8050/interaktion/index.php5/SkyRoads</a>there's a screenshot of the game
 eulerscheZahl: and the code at the bottom. long ago
 eulerscheZahl: so far i mostly used Django for web development
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: ok
 eulerscheZahl: but most of the time i'm writing desktop applications
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: linux?
 eulerscheZahl: at work i'm on windows. at home it's all linux
 zizo1337: im on linux too but i use windows when it comes to winforms,WPF
 Hjax: so yesterday i asked about the heuristic jrke is using for dots and boxes, but then i forgot to check chat again :D 
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: if u wanna protect your data the best way is linux and vms on linux
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=World%2F&amp;namespace=3000">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=World%2F&amp;namespace=3000</a> have fun Hjax
 Hjax: is that an archive of the entire chat
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: also Fr and Ru
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-08-24">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-08-24</a>
 eulerscheZahl: say thanks to bdbr
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: windows is pretty ridicolous when it comes to data protection
 AntiSquid: ctrl + F&#160;: hjax
 eulerscheZahl: or usability :imp:
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: are you serious?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: preference
 AntiSquid: no windows is easier to use in most regards
 AntiSquid: in fact the secure part of linux sometimes is a kick in the foot when you try to do something ... gave me lots of headaches 
 eulerscheZahl: funny thing about that chat history: it's a wiki so it still supports wiki syntax
 eulerscheZahl: like
 eulerscheZahl: or
 eulerscheZahl: &lt;math display="block"&gt;\text{geometric series:}\quad \begin{align} \sum_{i=0}^\infty 2^{-i}=2 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: come back tomorrow to see it :D
 AntiSquid: and sometimes i can't use stuff that works on 18.04 for 20.04 (ubuntu)
 AntiSquid: guess it's not that "stable" yet
 eulerscheZahl: the dist upgrade broke my microphone settings&#160;:/
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: yes it needs a lot patience, vms for games e.g
 AntiSquid: vms for games? 
 eulerscheZahl: sounds laggy
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: games which you can only play on windows
 AntiSquid: lol maybe windows will need a vm soon
 eulerscheZahl: i play with wine occasionally. but i only play older ones anyways
 AntiSquid: some games run better on ubuntu 20 with the right graphics card, don't blame the system
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: ok but r6 for example 
 AntiSquid: or manjaro 
 AntiSquid: what's r6?
 zizo1337: alot of windows games gets ported to linux
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: rainbow 6 siege
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: since a lot of programers are working on the OS its gonna get better 
 AntiSquid: ah just to clarify, was referring to recent updates on steam, they added a lot of support
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: at least in terms of usabilty
 AntiSquid: see how to enable proton on steam
 AntiSquid: planet zoo btw doesn't run on windows for me
 AntiSquid: but runs on linux
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: its supposed to run on windows isnt it
 AntiSquid: but even if you don't use steam there are lots of alternatives and they get quick updates, see lutris, wine ... etc
 AntiSquid: NoiselessDictator_aeca yes it is, but it didn't for me at least, so it's funny to see one game that works on linux but not windows when it's a windows game to begin with
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: ok
 AntiSquid: but what if i want to run other software generic stuff that doesn't get support on linux? i still need windows
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: its definitely worth it since china and others is collecting data 
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: you can setup a Virtual box
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: with windows on it
 AntiSquid: but that defeats the purpose
 AntiSquid: and cuts down on system resources
 AntiSquid: and you still use windows!! basically
 AntiSquid: maybe in another decade you can say goodbye to windows
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: yes but its a lot safer and they cannot just take your data
 AntiSquid: you can be unsafe on linux and safe on windows too
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: you can make a virtual box and just use it for gaming
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: nothing personal dat
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: data
 AntiSquid: if you use google / facebook on linux then how much safer is your data?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: linux is open source
 AntiSquid: i think we are talking past each other
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: you can make one acc for gaming and the personal stuff on linux
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: linux will always be safer than windows because it is open source and they are not collecting data like windows does
 AntiSquid: what linux do you use anyway
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: well i dont use linux but going to it in the future
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: use*
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: and its easier to use + my pc is not that good
 AntiSquid: really? what OS do you use? 
 AntiSquid: windows 10&#160;?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: yes
 AntiSquid: then you are better off with ubuntu in terms of performance
 AntiSquid: or get a light weight version
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: i dont like it but it more comfortable
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: i would have to setup a virtuel box for windows 10 to play games 
 AntiSquid: not really no
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: but like I said perhaps in the future
 AntiSquid: what platform do you play games on&#160;?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: how do you do which games i play
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: epic, riot, rockstar
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: blizzard
 AntiSquid: blizz is lame, they ban for using wine sometimes they are best to be avoided anyway
 AntiSquid: but you can still play on wine the low quality acti-blizz games
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: yes ik but u gon need it for rainbow
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: what if i dont like the low quality acti-blizz games lmao
 zizo1337: blizz can detect that u are playing on wine?
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: they ban you if you play on a virtual box
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: yes
 zizo1337: i thought they were undetectable
 AntiSquid: are you sure? lol
 AntiSquid: no zizo1337 it's if you add some extension which trigger their hypersensitive anti-cheat system or whatever it is
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: the youtuber someordinarygamers got banned on blizz while using a box on linux
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: he played r6
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: anti cheat is ass
 AntiSquid: and sometimes games won't work immediately after an update zizo1337
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: lol i have to go bye
 AntiSquid: but . linux makes updating drivers much easier for example
 NoiselessDictator_e4c4: nice conversation tho
 AntiSquid: NoiselessDictator_aeca get kubuntu
 Laminator: what up  yall
 Hjax: i still dont see the strategic depth in dots and boxes 
 jrke:&#160;;)
 Hjax: my submission is 60 lines of code and won a game against yours :P
 jrke: but just one
 Hjax: i could golf it too, its just some messy inefficient python 
 Hjax: yeah but my bot is practically the naive / greedy solution, why is it winning any games 
 Hjax: watching your bot play i can predict its move basically every turn 
 jrke: you won another one
 Hjax: theres a few tricks i havent added yet 
 jrke: nice 
 jrke: i think you are pushing me down
 Hjax: :D
 Hjax: losing to tric and dbd r 
 jrke: seems you have good strategy against me
 jrke: what again i losed
 jrke: you pushed me 3rd
 Hjax: all hail king tric :P
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want hail. only glory
 Hjax: all glory to the hypnotoad
 Hjax: yeah i have 0 wins against tric, illeda n, dbd r, and leojean
 Hjax: but i went 5-2 against you jkre
 Hjax: jrke*
 jrke: dunno why this is happening :thinking: and you are winning when you are player A right?
 Hjax: looks like it yeah 
 Hjax: we are both deterministic, so we only play 2 games
 jrke: oh found one bug 
 Hjax: going to crush me now? :D 
 jrke: yup
 jrke: but i don't believe myself in rank prediction :stuck_out_tongue:
 Hjax: you beat me, but now you lose to tric and illeda n
 jrke: ya
 jrke: will fix it tom&gt;&gt;
 jrke: gn 
 Hjax: gn
 Tom.py: ERROR 404
 MSmits: lol I just submitted the silly heuristic bot I could have gotten out of wood 2 with in 20 minutes
 MSmits:  iguess you get halfway up the ladder in wood 1 with that
 Hjax: my bot is currently about 20 minutes of work 
 Hjax: so yeah XD
 MSmits: my first version solved 2x2 :P
 MSmits: on turn 1
 darkhorse64: silly: score when you can, otherwise random place&#160;? 
 MSmits: I used mcts solver. The reason I did this is to make sure I find bugs early
 Hjax: i really dont think this game is hard to solve though, like it doesnt seem strategically deep at all 
 MSmits: thats true for 2x2, not for 7x7
 MSmits: it has much strategic depth
 Hjax: really? i feel like theres probably a heuristic strategy that plays perfectly 
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: whole books have been written about the math of this game
 darkhorse64: There is a full book dedicated to D&amp;B strategy
 MSmits: 5x5 and smaller have been solved
 Hjax: huh interesting 
 Hjax: so it only looks easy 
 MSmits: but even though 5x5 seems not much smaller than 7x7, it's probably a factor of a million less complex
 MSmits: if not more
 jacek: the game looks like you could have decent bot with just nice heuristic without search
 MSmits: my bot solved 2x2 in 8 ms
 MSmits: 5x5 took someone 8 years
 MSmits: of run time
 jacek: so how long would took you 3x3
 MSmits: not sure, probably less than a day with my inefficient algorithm
 MSmits: but 3x4 would probably take many days
 jacek: challenge accepted?
 MSmits: nah, i want to make a working bot for 7x7
 MSmits: i mean one that has a search
 MSmits: and does proper chain analysis
 MSmits: first the chain analysis and solver, then the actual search, I'll have a simulation that returns 0 for a while
 jacek: so five minutes to learn, a lifetime to master
 MSmits: yeah
 Hjax: ok well, im satisfied with my crappy 20 minute heuristic 
 jacek: i jsut realized there are no draws on 7x7 *_*
 Hjax: when are getting chess, id definitely play chess
 Hjax: did struct die, i havent seen him in a while 
 Hjax: computer chess is super interesting imo
 Hjax: lots of really deep theory, lots of room to book people, but even with a great book you dont get a free win
 jacek: so youve heard about nnue
 Hjax: ive heard about nnue yes, but ive been following computer chess for years 
 Hjax: since like TCEC 5 or so? 
 Hjax: im not sure NNUE would be good on codingame though
 Hjax: given the upload size, potentially old processors running the games, and time limit 
 jacek: nnue has 40960 inputs so...
 Hjax: you could make a smaller network, but even so, would it beat a hand crafted eval 
 jacek: im using something similar for breakthrough, that is NN as eval, trained firstly on handcrafed eval + some depth. and it works
 Hjax: really the big breakthrough of NNUE is that its incrementally updated and can make good use of the SIMD instructions 
 jacek: yeah, i only update relevant squares
 Hjax: ah so youre similar then 
 jacek: im too dumb for simd or avx yet
 Hjax: using a neural net for eval is hardly new, but NNUE is crazy fast 
 jacek: they just found relevant inputs that are nn-friendly
 reCurse: ^ this really
 Hjax: it got ported from shogi right
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: AFAIK the real important thing about NNUE is not so much what it does but that it's cpu friendly
 reCurse: Makes it possible to combine with a deep and fast search like stockfish's
 jacek: i.e. side-to-move before was just another bit, while in nnue you have technically 2 different nets for side to move
 reCurse: That's about it really, its eval is way inferior to leela
 Hjax: leela has been sort of meandering around recently, doesnt seem to be making any new breakthroughs 
 reCurse: Disclaimer: personal opinion
 Hjax: still plays very drawish chess
 Hjax: its of course quite good 
 jacek: eval is inferior to leela, but speed is still 100x or more
 reCurse: Sure because search matters more than eval in chess
 reCurse: Apparently so anyway
 Hjax: that was actually part of why people hadnt tried NNs much in chess even after alphago 
 Hjax: they were thinking that since chess was so tactical, the faster hand crafted eval would win out anyway 
 reCurse: Yeah but in practice though leela should be better
 reCurse: Subtle early positioning rippling way into the late game
 reCurse: It's just extremely expensive to train so
 Hjax: a common complaint is that its unfair to leela because most chess tournaments use books 
 Hjax: removing leelas opening positional edge
 reCurse: That's extremely debatable
 reCurse: The eval also has an equivalent of opening book
 reCurse: Well, the policy more so
 jacek: now they complain nnue can contain some sort of 'book'
 Hjax: it is, personally i disagree, but its a common complaint 
 Hjax: a great chess engine plays great chess from any position
 reCurse: Some positions are more exploitable than others
 Hjax: also chess is a drawfest if you dont have unbalanced book exits 
 Hjax: at long time control + powerful hardware + table bases 
 reCurse: Sure
 reCurse: It's also been extensively studied by humans for centuries and computers for decades
 reCurse: Any balanced game will lead to the same result given sufficient time
 Hjax: watching sf nnue play cccc has been pretty entertaining 
 Hjax: its so rare to have a breakthrough where one engine just starts crushing everyone 
 reCurse: I still find there's more value in leela's NN if only that it shows more potential understanding than search
 reCurse: But to each its own views
 reCurse: The fact it performs incredibly well with so few nodes is quite amazing
 Hjax: leela is definitely really cool 
 reCurse: NNUE's eval seems a lot more like... how to say...
 reCurse: Sporadic lighthouses guiding stockfish's search near the coast
 reCurse: If that makes sense
 reCurse: If you take the eval at any given point it's quite noisy
 Hjax: yeah leela plays better chess than me if you just take the first move from her policy 
 reCurse: Or in other words...
 reCurse: It's relying on the search being able to reach a move down the line where it will make the eval jump
 reCurse: Like a beacon really
 reCurse: Leela's eval is a *lot* smoother
 Hjax: yeah this is true 
 reCurse: Again, my personal interpretation
 Hjax: stockfish only cares about elo
 Hjax: so if it plays good moves, they dont really care 
 reCurse: Well that's true for all engines
 reCurse: I just find more value in examining leela's eval and policy
 reCurse: As a human
 reCurse: It probably has subtle understanding of known concepts like open files and such
 reCurse: That are way more insightful if we can ever inspect it properly
 Hjax: some pro chess player (carlsen?) one said playing a chess engine feels like playing an idiot who beats you every time 
 Hjax: i would imagine leela feels more natural 
 reCurse: It relies more on something akin to 'experience'
 reCurse: More relatable
 Hjax: i wonder if leela will make any more big breakthoughs, i would expect it to be able to keep pace with stockfish, but things have seemed slow recetly 
 Hjax: recently*
 reCurse: Without NNUE it would have become dominant I think
 reCurse: If the strength balance is more towards search than eval then I don't see leela having any chance
 reCurse: But we'll see
 Hjax: im also interested to see where NNUE goes, is there a lot more elo to squeeze out of the current network architecture? or is it always saturated 
 Hjax: already*
 reCurse: It seems way too hackish to be anywhere close to optimal IMHO
 Hjax: i agree, but it seems like the most effort is being put into testing new hacks on when to use each eval 
 reCurse: If all you care is results then it's the path of least resistance
 Hjax: switching between two evals in a a/b framework just seems disgusting to me 
 reCurse: If you care about research that's another story
 reCurse: When you get something that new and weird and seemingly effective around
 reCurse: You get tons of people throwing whatever at it and see what sticks
 reCurse: Same with RL a few years ago
 Hjax: yeah, the logic thats being added to SFs evaluate() method is just..... gross 
 MSmits: I've noticed it's pretty hard to even measure that one thing is better than another thing
 Hjax: but i guess if it adds elo its good 
 Hjax: according to SFs philosophy 
 MSmits: unless it's very clear ofc
 jacek: but they test it via selfplay
 Hjax: well stockfish has fishtest for its patches
 MSmits: jacek that's even worse I think
 jacek: how do they overcome overfiting
 reCurse: Depends how exploitable a strategy is
 reCurse: It's very possible we're already somewhere in the global optima, so then it doesn't matter
 reCurse: Or at least something like it, then the true global optima is truly well hidden
 Hjax: yeah i think the assumption is that stockfish plays strong enough chess that an improvement in selfplay is almost always an improvement in general 
 edwin-py: whats the best codingame?
 reCurse: This one
 edwin-py: which one?
 reCurse: This
 jacek: :soccer:
 edwin-py: so clash of code?
 reCurse: Sure
 MSmits: what I've noticed from experimenting with a lot of different games against partially deterministic bots is that they are easily exploited. So to there has to be some randomness at least. Does stockfish always play the same move in the same position?
 MSmits: given the same calculation time that is
 Prince349k: simp
 reCurse: That's extremely debatable
 edwin-py: stfu prince
 reCurse: This is not a classroom
 Prince349k: xD
 Hjax: stockfish wont play the same move if you are searching with multiple threads 
 reCurse: Keep your banter off or get banned
 Hjax: because lazy smp is super timing sensitive 
 Sourabhingale: how to learn  to code games in this
 edwin-py: aight
 MSmits: ok thats good I guess Hjax
 reCurse: Randomness is only good if the optimal strategy is mixed
 reCurse: Otherwise it's bad
 Hjax: lazy smp is a weird beast 
 MSmits: the problem is that you probably dont have the optimal strategy
 Hjax: they basically let a bunch of threads fight over the transposition table 
 Hjax: and search at the same time 
 Hjax: and somehow it plays good moves 
 reCurse: Sure, but you can probably see whether it's likely mixed or not
 MSmits: what do you mean by mixed exactly?
 reCurse: In case of chess I heavily doubt it's mixed
 reCurse: That the optimal strategy is to play randomly between different moves
 reCurse: Think RPS
 MSmits: hmm
 Hjax: chess definitely isnt mixed strat, theres an objectively correct move in every position 
 Hjax: that you can prove 
 reCurse: Prove??
 reCurse: Maybe in endgames
 Hjax: well, given infinite resources
 MSmits: that's true for every game 
 MSmits: perfect information non-random i mean
 MSmits: non simultaneous
 Hjax: are there perfect info, non random, non simul games that are mixed strat?
 MSmits: there's always a best move, or multiple ones
 dbdr: mixed strategy can only be optimal in smultaneous-move games
 reCurse: Sure Hjax
 reCurse: I think CSB has some mixed strat
 reCurse: Oh non simul
 reCurse: NVM
 Hjax: yeah so im pretty confident chess isnt a mixed strat game 
 reCurse: I'm not well versed enough in game theory to assert that
 dbdr: the optimal strategy is always to play the minimax move
 Hjax: ^
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: going to the roots
 MSmits: so there's 1 best move or multiple
 dbdr: leaves sry
 MSmits: but it never should depend on your opponent
 MSmits: unless you know the opponent and counterbooked him :P
 jacek: the best move is not to play
 dbdr: that assumes perfect opponent
 MSmits: yes, but you have to
 reCurse: Well if we care about nash equilibrium yeah
 reCurse: If you care about leaderboards then no
 Hjax: game theory doesnt care about how hard your game is, it just cares about perfect play 
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: hard is a weird statement for multi player games
 dbdr: again, nash is for simultaneous
 MSmits: unless it means one player has a handicap
 Hjax: *hard* being game tree size i suppose 
 reCurse: Um, not necessarily?
 reCurse: Nash is optimal in general
 reCurse: It can be a dominant strat or mixed
 reCurse: Unless there's semantics I'm failing
 dbdr: how could it be different from minimax?
 MSmits: it cant be for what you mean
 MSmits: non simult
 Hjax: for non simul perfect info games games, there always existss a dominant strat, that strat being to play the minimax move
 MSmits: 2 player
 Hjax: yeah 
 MSmits: perfect infomation
 reCurse: Sure but isn't that also a NE?
 reCurse: The minimax?
 MSmits: mmh not sure, I thought so
 Hjax: uh, yes technically 
 dbdr: I guess it's a degenerate case
 reCurse: Sure but when you say NE that's perfect play
 reCurse: Regardless of mixed or dominant strat
 reCurse: So it seems a superior term to me
 Hjax: i think usually when people refer to NE they are implying a mixed strat 
 Hjax: but yes thats not necessarily the case 
 reCurse: Really?
 reCurse: I didn't think so
 MSmits: it's because mixed is more complicated
 dbdr: potentially mixed. might be 100% one move
 MSmits: if you want to understand NE you need to understand mixed too
 reCurse: I guess
 reCurse: I can't see a better term to designate perfect play in all scenarios though
 Hjax: have you guys seen the rps programming site? 
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: That's the perfect example of NE vs leaderboards
 Hjax: its super interesting 
 reCurse: It only exists because some bots are not following NE
 Hjax: because the random agent doesnt do well at all, because the best agents exploit the exploitable ones 
 reCurse: Shows the limitation of NE in practical scenarios
 reCurse: Like leaderboards
 Hjax: also forced open source 
 Hjax: which is kind of a unique idea 
 Hjax: for that kind of competition 
 dbdr: same happened in poker
 MSmits: mmh you could also just have some bots using an inferior NE, because they have less simulations, using a slower language etc.
 reCurse: No in case of RPS it's definitive
 MSmits: that also gives RPS effects on leaderboards
 reCurse: The NE is known
 reCurse: Infallible
 MSmits: oh do you mean the actual game RPS:
 MSmits:&#160;?
 reCurse: Yes
 Hjax: yes 
 MSmits: owwww
 dbdr: a team solved poker up to epsilon, but another team beat them by better exploiting weaker bots
 Hjax: theres an actual programming site where people play RPS 
 MSmits: yeah i know
 Hjax: on the RPS leaderboard im sure theres a bot that always plays rock, so your bot better be able to beat it 
 reCurse: It took me a while at first to understand why it's even a thing
 MSmits: i was just confused, we use the term for other games too
 Hjax: you cant just play the mixed strat 
 jacek: there is some rps demo in cg
 reCurse: But then I realized it's all about exploiting the weak
 reCurse: Like real world
 dbdr: reCurse says shifumi for that&#160;:)
 Hjax: yeah ^ 
 dbdr: not exactly, real world has a lot of non-zero sum situations
 reCurse: Sure, you know what I mean though
 MSmits: just add a constant and it's zero again
 dbdr: nope
 jacek: such integral
 dbdr: (to Msmits)
 MSmits: then the problem is that it's a non-constant sum
 reCurse: Change to 'exploiting others for self or mutual benefit' if it suits you better
 MSmits: not that it's a non-zero sum
 Hjax: now you are just being pedantic 
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 dbdr: yeah, it's indeed non-constant
 dbdr: no, it's a good point
 MSmits: aw damn, i was going for pedantic
 dbdr: :D
 reCurse: You're still pedantic in my heart
 MSmits: thanks reCurse&#160;:)
 MSmits: gotta stay home from work this week till wife corona test is done&#160;:(
 MSmits: she's probably negative, but can't go to work
 reCurse: Been WFH for 6 months and looks like another 4 at least
 MSmits: damn
 Hjax: i only got to wfh for 2 weeks 
 reCurse: It has its ups and downs
 jacek: just like elevator operator
 Hjax: pros: cat on lap, cons: cat on lap 
 MSmits: and quarks
 Hjax: that was my experience at least :D 
 dbdr: i've been WFH for 15 years&#160;:)
 reCurse: Pros: no commute Cons: work longer because no separation
 MSmits: why work longer?
 reCurse: Because there is no separation
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: you get disturbed during work?
 reCurse: Thankfully not really
 MSmits: why does it take longer then?
 reCurse: Because work time and home time are overlapping
 MSmits: it's still a choice isnt it?
 reCurse: Sure
 reCurse: Takes more discipline than say
 dbdr: yeah, I found it's better to concentrate first, then call it a day and mean it
 reCurse: Oh I better leave at 6pm because I got 45 mins commute and don't want to be home too late
 MSmits: right that's true, you have to keep an eye on your work hours
 reCurse: vs
 Hjax: cgp grey made a good video about that 
 reCurse: Oh it's 6pm but I could finish this first since I can go off instantly
 Hjax: called Quarantine Productivity: Spaceship You
 Hjax: about how important it is to have separate spaces for things 
 reCurse: Takes a lot more discipline to manage
 Hjax: when you are locked up in your house 
 dbdr: yeah, CGP is usually very interesting
 MSmits: reCurse can't you also just stop an hour earlier the next day?
 Hjax: his videos are all fantastic 
 reCurse: You keep bringing rational solutions to a discipline problem
 MSmits: mmh true
 Hjax: recurse is saying he doesnt have an incentive to stop working 
 Hjax: because hes home anyway 
 Hjax: so he just works and works and works 
 Hjax: i think 
 reCurse: Partly yes
 reCurse: It's all psychological
 MSmits: hmm ok
 dbdr: write a virus on your machine that stops you from working &lt;= technical solution
 reCurse: I hate the commute but I like the time off to separate
 dbdr: (at certain times)
 reCurse: Hard to explain if you don't feel the same way
 eulerscheZahl: he has that virus already: windows update
 MSmits: that has gotten more horrible
 Hjax: recurse do you work in the same room you relax in? 
 reCurse: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: came back from lunch today and it took ages without logging me back in, did a hard reset
 MSmits: i remember the time when they were voluntary, the i[dates
 MSmits: updates
 eulerscheZahl: thank god VS has a file recovery
 Hjax: at least cgp greys suggestion would be to separate the two spaces
 Hjax: to help give your mind a line between the two things 
 Hjax: work and relaxing 
 reCurse: I didn't purchase my place with wfh considerations
 reCurse: Unfortunately
 dbdr: seems using windows = masochism :D
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't my free choice
 reCurse: At least not for that long of a period
 dbdr: you always have a choice&#160;;) but I know what you mean
 reCurse: linux gui = masochism
 reCurse: This is objective truth
 MSmits: I agree
 eulerscheZahl: i love my i3
 dbdr: ^
 MSmits: i3?
 Hjax: thats the really simple tiling one right
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't look nice and shiny but fits my workflow to get things done quickly
 dbdr: i3wm
 Hjax: its a window manager 
 MSmits: oh
 Hjax: but you dont drag things around 
 Hjax: you assign them to parts of the screen with hotkeys 
 MSmits: oh noes, hotkeys
 Hjax: the screen is always full, divided into sections 
 eulerscheZahl: one window =&gt; full screenadd a second window =&gt; split screen in half
 reCurse: I've tried various guis on and off for at least 20 years
 MSmits: you made some yourself
 reCurse: They always are so far behind windows it's not funny
 reCurse: For desktop I mean
 MSmits: ah
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your requirements
 MSmits: yeah thats the one thing thats stopping me from using any other operating system
 Hjax: yeah every linux distro i try always has some weird config issue in its gui that makes it clunky and annoying 
 dbdr: what advantage does windows have in that respect, according to you?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't need nice colors. quickly moving my windows where i need them has top priority for me
 Hjax: for instance when i tried KDE recently, whenever i rebooted it would forget the layout of my monitors 
 Hjax: and setting up my monitors after every reboot got annoying fast
 MSmits: I had to use an ubuntu installation on a vm for a while. I thought the gui was horrible
 eulerscheZahl: and i only have 1 monitor, that part cant get messed up
 Hjax: oh you probably were using unity 
 Hjax: unity /is/ horrible 
 dbdr: Hjax: sounds like something that could be automated
 reCurse: It's hard to describe UX in few words
 MSmits: unity?
 MSmits: I like unity
 reCurse: Almost like MS invested millions if not billions in that
 Hjax: ubuntus home grown desktop environment 
 dbdr: definitely don't do anything manually when it can be automated
 eulerscheZahl: ubuntu doesn't use unity anymore, does it?
 jacek: unity3d?
 Hjax: optimized for touch screens instead of desktop 
 Hjax: and then shipped onto desktop 
 MSmits: yeah jacek
 dbdr: ubuntu uses gnome 3 now
 Hjax: yeah because they realized unity was terrible
 MSmits: their gui is not so great, thats true
 Hjax: idk, i just want a desktop environment that just works 
 Hjax: i dont want to have to config things 
 Hjax: automate things by hand 
 Hjax: i just want it to work 
 MSmits: i like unity for giving so much for free that usually needs expensive software
 eulerscheZahl: me too. my i3config is still pretty basic
 reCurse: I mean they're unfortunately working hard on W10 to regress
 reCurse: But they still have decades of studies to back them up
 Hjax: windows driver support is still unparalleled 
 eulerscheZahl: just a few shortcuts like windows+M to open monodevelop
 Hjax: want to run a game on linux, well i hope it works in WINE
 Hjax: because if not youre out of luck 
 dbdr: sure, it's a different philosophy. windows or mac probably have a reasonable thing by default, but many things cannot be changed or automated easily
 reCurse: With WSL what's the point of even booting linux on my desktop
 reCurse: inb4 FSF arguments
 eulerscheZahl: with wine what's the point of booting windows? :D
 Hjax: games 
 EveryOS: WSL does not work with all Linux software
 reCurse: Are you really going there
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, just reversing the arguement
 reCurse: WINE is at best a hack
 Hjax: graphics drivers that dont sap 50% of the performance off of my expensive graphics card
 MSmits: reCurse do game devs usually use windows?
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: i thought so
 dbdr: I never need WINE these days
 Hjax: pretty sure they almost always use windows 
 Hjax: linux graphics driver support is a nightmare
 Hjax: half supported official drivers and half baked open source ones 
 reCurse: I'll say WSL has done a lot more to bridge the gap than WINE
 reCurse: For understandable reasons obviously
 reCurse: I'm talking strictly from a practical pov
 Hjax: WSL had awful IO at first 
 Hjax: but i think they fixed it now?
 reCurse: WSL2
 Hjax: yeah 
 reCurse: And awful... always depends on your workflow
 reCurse: Don't expect to run a production db from it obviously
 Hjax: i think i was doing starcraft ai stuff in WSL when i last tried it 
 Hjax: starcraft took a solid 5 minutes to load 
 dbdr: I think we are two groups of Stockholm Syndrom victims from different kidnappers talking to each other :D
 reCurse: Oh ok that sounds fair
 reCurse: I thought I mentioned objective truth earlier /s
 Hjax: 5 minutes to load from a SSD.... definitely awful 
 reCurse: It's right in the pitfall
 AntiSquid: honestly, give ubuntu 20 or latest manjaro a try, a lot changed, installing drivers is super simple
 AntiSquid: even have latest graphics drivers installed, just look up nvidia ppa for example on how to setup ... just one initial setup then it's automated for you afterwards
 reCurse: Incentive is really lacking this time around
 AntiSquid: steam is developing full support for linux games
 AntiSquid: the initiative for me is the fact that i need the linux environment
 AntiSquid: and WSL is silly 
 reCurse: WSL is the best thing that happened to windows in a long while, not sure why you say it's silly
 reCurse: It has virtually eliminated most of my needs to have native linux
 reCurse: Both for personal and work stuff
 AntiSquid: it's a good tool if you have to rely on windows
 AntiSquid: it's just not as good as a linux install
 reCurse: There's an order of magnitude more stuff missing from windows on linux than the other way around
 AntiSquid: such as?
 reCurse: UI, software, tools, drivers, support...
 AntiSquid: too many UI versions to pick from, drivers not sure what you mean found everything i wanted, maybe if there's something you're looking for atm i could give some directions?
 reCurse: Thanks but I don't need help, I have almost no incentive to bother now thanks to WSL
 reCurse: I'm just saying why
 jacek: :o
 AntiSquid: i can agree on the software part, some of it is difficult to make it run natively
 AntiSquid: compatibility can be weird on linux inbetween version, but encountered similar issues between windows versions
 jacek: so far d&amp;b is quite meta. i win against illedan and some against tric, but lose to others
 jacek: would euler like this game :thinking: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toads_and_Frogs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toads_and_Frogs</a>
 MSmits: it's partisan
 MSmits: ohh I see what you're doing jacek
 MSmits: you're reading one of Elwyns books to become better at D&amp;B and found that game at the start of it
 MSmits: Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays.
 jacek: elwyns book?
 eulerscheZahl: a game about toads, yay!
 MSmits: Elwyn is the top expert on D&amp;B
 MSmits: don't pretend you dont know this jacek, you sneaky you
 jacek: or maybe i discovered strategies on my own
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KboGyIilP6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KboGyIilP6k</a>
 MSmits: this is 4x4 specifically
 MSmits: or no, 3x3 i think
 jacek: the comments "mastering art of swastikas"
 MSmits: hehe yes
 MSmits: it's the top strategy for that size
 MSmits: you have to be white supremacist to win, it is known
 reCurse: ...
 MSmits: watch the video :P
 MSmits: don't pre-judge 
 MSmits: it's actually pretty neat, every size increase adds new strategic elements
 jacek: honeslty i havent heard of the guy. if my bot acts like him its pure coincedence
 EveryOS: I decided to go back to CodinGame yesterday because it had been a whileI'm now doing the TicTacToe game, which is rather hard. I'm at 6 in bronze league.
 jacek: also, i treat score 25 as over. you can that after having 25 square the moves are random
 jacek: ultimate tic tac toe?
 EveryOS: Yes
 DR1Rush: 1vs1?
 EveryOS: Yea

 EveryOS: Ya'll... didn't submit? Ran into the clash time limit?
 jacek: maybe it was too hard
 EveryOS: It was an easy code golf oneBut neither of the other players submittedI got 88 (went with JS despite being my least favorite language), but I dunno how that would've compared
 Memo12334: in coders strike back, I am in bronz leaugue and got the collision thing now. Could anyone give me a strategy how I would tackle this challenge. Like a good enough way of giving thrust and what to do with the 400 units
 EveryOS: Oh shoot, I resubmitted with new code, and I don't think I will get as high as my last submission
 MSmits: jacek I didnt mean to say your bot was similar to anything. I only suggested you were reading books to improve your D&amp;B (which is what I do)
 jacek: mhhmm
 Memo12334: sry
 wajs: Going good?
 AntiSquid: DR1Rush use #clash channel to spam that
 AntiSquid: ah he is gone
 11Firefox11: :neutral_face:
 Schwase: YOOOOO
 Schwase: was on and off cause i was at work but IM HEREEEEEEE
 AntiSquid: welcome HEREEEEE
 JBM: Please stay HEREEEEEEE 
 Hovsep: i hate programming
 Uljahn: programming hates you too, but Automaton2000 does not
 Automaton2000: and i won't have much time for that
 Crossbow: site still laggy for anyone else?
 Zm4j: any tips on how to make my code shorter in c++?
 The_Auditor: @Automation2000 time? i thought you have everything automated
 The-Code-Whisperer: how do i join the #clash channel?
 Razaloc: joining the clash 
 Razaloc: i can't get to wood 1 league in Coders Strike back, the race of bots, even though i win the race =( 
 Razaloc: I'm stucked in league wood 2 
 Razaloc: solved&#160;! 
 2berkir: this site is really exciting
 Putnam3145: allotted response time is 1 second but it's letting me go for slightly more than 1??
 Putnam3145: eh, I'll just keep going like that's not the case
 itzblinkzy: zakki do you mind sharing your code please?
 itzblinkzy: Thanks&#160;:)
 zakki: yes. it's straight forward if-then-else
 Putnam3145: alright! i've submitted my code! time to scrap it and make something else completely
 simonysck: is there a way to play on previous leagues? I want to refactor my code before going onto the next league

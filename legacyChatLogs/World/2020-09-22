 Saptarshi: Finally I'm a disciple...:kissing_smiling_eyes:4
 Saptarshi: is C++ more preferred than C in interviews?
 lichking23333: anyone there?
 Saptarshi: yep
 Bassel: Hello guys
 lichking23333: hello
 Saptarshi: hey bassel
 MadKnight: anyone still here, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is there anything i should know that
 StevePRGM: heh
 MadKnight: hey StevePRGM
 MadKnight: doing puzzles&#160;?
 StevePRGM: puzzled on the best way to be more effective at C++...
 StevePRGM: i'm considering either puzzles or a self-creation on my local
 StevePRGM: MedKnight, what language(s) do you enjoy?&#160;:)
 MadKnight: c# 
 MadKnight: mostly
 MadKnight: check private messages StevePRGM
 StevePRGM: alrighty
 MadKnight: StevePRGM&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is there a good way to get the data
 Denshire: A question we need answered
 JBM: what if the answer was "no"?
 Denshire: :pensive:
 solution.cpp: @Saptarshi For most jobs yes
 Saptarshi: Can anyone suggest me some projects in C or Java and Py for CV
 globetrotter: @Saptarshi, me too

 midomawk: guys when i modify a cell in python the whole column got changed it is normal&#160;?
 midomawk: im using a 2d list
 Saptarshi: how are u doin' that
 Saptarshi: can u elaborate
 midomawk: lst[i][i] = 'a'
 Saptarshi: cuz thats not normal
 Saptarshi: nd how does ur list looks...jst an eg
 Saptarshi: example*
 midomawk: n = int(input())lst = [[<i>]*n]*n</i>
 midomawk: for exampe if i change lst[n / 2][n / 2] = 'o'
 midomawk: the whole column n/2 will get 'o'
 midomawk: this is a normal behavior or not&#160;?
 Saptarshi: uhh
 Saptarshi: im also facing this
 Saptarshi: idk
 Saptarshi: lemme figure it out
 PositiveQuark: I guess it comes from the fact that you create [] which is an object and then you multiply it with n
 PositiveQuark: That is that you create an object in memory and have n variables pointing to the same object
 Saptarshi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cadbcfe-f7d2-4e62-8193-857d3631835a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cadbcfe-f7d2-4e62-8193-857d3631835a</a>
 PositiveQuark: you update the object in memory but you leave the pointers
 Arrakis_: yes, the *n operator copies the value n times, if the value is a reference to an object you get n-times the reference to the same object
 Saptarshi: follow this ^
 midomawk: alright thank guys
 PositiveQuark: you might need to create new arrays
 Saptarshi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cadbcfe-f7d2-4e62-8193-857d3631835a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8cadbcfe-f7d2-4e62-8193-857d3631835a</a>
 Saptarshi: this will help ^
 Arrakis_: the way I do it usually is [[] for _ in range(n)]
 Arrakis_: to initialize 2d array of len = n
 Saptarshi: yep @Arrakis
 Saptarshi: its the correct way
 Saptarshi: btw python sucks
 Uljahn: also you can use numpy on CG
 Saptarshi: learn C
 Arrakis_: no it doesnt:D
 Arrakis_: i know c
 Arrakis_: every language has its place
 Arrakis_: C is fast to execute but python is fast to develop
 Saptarshi: yep being a programmer i shouldnt insult other langs
 Saptarshi: sorry
 Arrakis_: no language is perfect, but there might be a perfect language for the job you need done&#160;;)
 midomawk: it seems to me even if it is a pointer i can dereference it by n[][] and just put only my bytes
 Saptarshi: in c it becomes more easierint lst[n][n];
 midomawk: yeah on the stack
 Saptarshi: I have a separate fanbase for C:kissing_closed_eyes:
 Saptarshi: In Javaint lst[][]=new int[n][n]
 midomawk: yes but it is different you can't add to it
 midomawk: list in python = ArrayList in java 
 Saptarshi: hmm
 midomawk: an implementation of a dynamic array
 jacek: dynamic array? blashemy
 jacek: summer wrap up, summer wrap up ~
 Saptarshi: wrap up

 DomiKo: is there any way to make console output a little bit bigger?
 DomiKo: or there are only 3 modes
 DomiKo: zero mode, little mod, full mode

 DomiKo: no no
 DomiKo: I would love to make it higher
 DomiKo: zomming help a little bit

 DomiKo: Uljahn you are life saver
 DomiKo: thank you so much 
 Uljahn: yw
 pde-bakk: Maybe an old question for some of you, but how did you guys define an 'optimal path' in Coders Strike Back? I believe it is what I need to add to move up to legend league
 DomiKo: copying levels for Number Shifting will be some much easier :D
 DomiKo: 'optimal path'?
 DomiKo: there is no optimal path in CSB
 AntiSquid: he means optimal path the pods need to take to win :D
 AntiSquid: which is basically the problem statement
 DomiKo: ohh
 pde-bakk: Sometimes my pod approaches the checkpoint at a not-ideal angle which makes for inefficient turning, and I dont know how to change that
 DomiKo: are you using any search?
 pde-bakk: search?
 DomiKo: are you simulating anything?
 pde-bakk: Right now I'm just checking that with my current velocity I'd pass the next checkpoint in the next few turns, and I start turning towards the next next checkpoint already
 pde-bakk: Simulate how?
 pde-bakk: I dont think I am
 DomiKo: so maybe you should start slowing down too
 DomiKo: if you need to turn a lot to get to the next checkpoint
 pde-bakk: It's not that I'm missing the checkpoint, it's just that sometimes its more efficient to take a wider angle, but Im not sure how to simulate that
 pde-bakk: I take it you mean simulating with a Genetic Algorithm? Ive never worked with those
 DomiKo: you can you any type of search
 DomiKo: like Monte Carlo
 DomiKo: where you just make random moves
 DomiKo: and take the best ones
 pde-bakk: hmm interesting ive never done anything like that before
 DomiKo: here you can read about simulation in that game

 dotaicode: hi
 MSmits: hey guys
 DomiKo: hi 
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 MSmits: almost done with D&amp;B solver
 eulerscheZahl: js-games is back
 DomiKo: nice :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: and it did something against SQL injection
 MSmits: oh cool, i guess you made that happen
 Scarfield: you tested if you could still do it?
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't get an exception anymore for this username: ' -- 
 eulerscheZahl: before i got some MariaDB error message
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't try to push it any further, seems they replace the ' by another character now
 eulerscheZahl: wait, it's down again?
 DomiKo: no
 eulerscheZahl: oh, browser caching...
 Scarfield: you have been banned :p
 DomiKo: and they bring back your highscore
 Westicles: yeah, I emailed them and they said they didn't realize it was down
 eulerscheZahl: i see. they never replied to me reporting the SQL injection&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i guess you are more important
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 Westicles: I don't think that site is high on his list of priorities
 MSmits: yay, just tested my solver on 1 million random endgames. Slowest took 65 ms. 
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm a low priority subtask of a low priority task
 DomiKo: Westicles did you copy paste in "Number Shifting" 500+ times?
 eulerscheZahl: will you play that dots and boxes contest on the other site MSmits?rules look a little different to the CG version
 Westicles: DomiKo:  yes
 eulerscheZahl: :o
 DomiKo: omg
 MSmits: do you have a link euler?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dfa67af0-c2de-4975-903a-4b5417533c03">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dfa67af0-c2de-4975-903a-4b5417533c03</a>
 eulerscheZahl: from the CG discord
 MSmits: thanks I'll check it out
 MSmits: probably won't join, unless it's really similar and easy to port
 eulerscheZahl: watched a replay therelooks like you instantly conquer the whole region when you possibly can(?)
 eulerscheZahl: no trick to let the opponent take the last 2 of it
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: does that make the game simpler? Considering 5x5 D&amp;B is solved even
 eulerscheZahl: just from watching, didn't read the actual rules
 MSmits: ohh its very different
 MSmits: it's about enclosing zones
 MSmits: not boxes
 MSmits: if you fill in all the edges of the board, the game ends also
 eulerscheZahl: so not similar at all, you won't join
 MSmits: nah, but if it was on CG, I'd play
 eulerscheZahl: then port it yourself&#160;;)
 MSmits: too busy playing other people's work
 eulerscheZahl: soon there will be a 24h contest on another website
 eulerscheZahl: they have 5 categories with 5 tasks each
 eulerscheZahl: 1 is binary, are you interested?
 abecus: lol
 Westicles: Just reading what Magus said about the “ultimate dirty trick i use for my C++ golf codes” 
 eulerscheZahl: what is that trick?
 Westicles: He didn't say
 eulerscheZahl: system call?
 Westicles: No, something else.  Maybe there is write permission to put your own file somewhere?
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl I might be interested sure. Link me&#160;:)
 MSmits: even if i dont join, I like reading whats out there
 eulerscheZahl: now that I got you hooked (team contest), i can reveal that binary means you get a compiled program and have to debug it in one way or another
 eulerscheZahl: no bit masks

 MSmits: ack
 MSmits: that does not seem interesting to me at all :P
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: I am going to write my own hashtable for the first time
 MSmits: hope to make my solver a bit faster
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear, that sounds hardcore
 MSmits: I was thinking, an array of states that I index to with&#160;%  using a hashfunction with xorshift
 MSmits: i just overwrite hash collisions, that's fine, in my case that just means re-search
 MSmits: should be simple right?
 MSmits: if you dont have to deal with collisions, I don't think it's hard
 MSmits: seems like an interesting experiment to try different hashfunctions and table sizes, see what that does for performance
 MSmits: also, it seems for D&amp;B it helps to store both an upper and lower limit for ab pruning for every entry
 MSmits: instead of choosing between lower/upper/exact
 MSmits: this is because both players use the same transpositions
 eulerscheZahl: watch out for your wall of text&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's ended :P
 eulerscheZahl: with a dot
 eulerscheZahl: or a box?
 MSmits: .
 MSmits: did you ever get around to storing the upper and lower bounds for your minimax bots?
 MSmits: when using TT?
 eulerscheZahl: no. you made me realize i did it wrong
 CosmicStudios: Hello
 eulerscheZahl: but i didn't care enough to return to it
 MSmits: i thought it was hard to do, but i just copied some code and it was easy
 eulerscheZahl: just add alpha and beta to your state and hash it
 CosmicStudios: I'm new here and i' doing the Decent in javascript will you help?
 MSmits: just dont think about it too much, I always lose my line of thought when trying to follow what happens with abpruning and TT
 MSmits: it seems to be different from that eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: but that would work also, but it can be done better
 eulerscheZahl: wait, my alpha-beta doesn't even use TT
 MSmits: then it doesnt matter
 MSmits: this is a really good source for it. better than wiki: 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf">https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf</a>
 MSmits: written for chess, but doesnt matter
 MSmits: you immediately get code for negamax with ab pruning and TT on page 13, no need to look anywhere else, its great
 Scarfield: MMABSPP these names are getting kind of ridicoulus xD
 Scarfield: but i guess SPP is enough
 eulerscheZahl: that's what i'm usually missing in those papers: code
 eulerscheZahl: they explain their idea but aren't 100% accurate at some point and then the detective work starts
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i dont like that much either, but sometimes you have no choice
 AntiSquid: smitz are you aware of a dots and boxes contest on an external site?
 darkhorse64: It's a different game, actually
 MSmits: yeah it's completely different
 AntiSquid: is it not just a variation?
 AntiSquid: didn't look much at it
 MSmits: but thanks anyway AntiSquid, keep sharing
 MSmits: it's about capturing regions
 MSmits: cross between go and dots and boxes?
 MSmits: you dont take individual boxes
 MSmits: might seem small change, but the gameplay would be completely different
 MSmits: seems fairly easy to solve though, could be wrong
 darkhorse64: btw, this site has interesting contests based on board games. I wonder if they make it easy to wrote bots
 AntiSquid: they seem to have multiple rounds over the entire year though
 darkhorse64: *write*
 AntiSquid: idk, just randomly came across it when looking for something entirely different
 MSmits: oh it's Dutch
 MSmits: vier-op-een rij&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: maybe it's your colleague hosting it and you aren't aware
 MSmits: nah it's not, but could be someone he knows 
 MSmits: Q: Is there a limit for the size of my program source&#160;?A: Yes. Your program source file must not be larger than 1,474,560 bytes (the size of a floppy disk).
 MSmits: ooooh huge opening book&#160;:)
 DomiKo: lol
 MSmits: trying to figure out if there is some affiliation with a university or some such
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.informaticaolympiade.nl/">https://www.informaticaolympiade.nl/</a>
 MSmits: they are affiliated with that
 MSmits: which is basically very close to the subject i am teaching as it is informatica
 MSmits: so this is actually only twice removed from my job :P
 darkhorse64: You have 30s for the whole game. It's up to you to manage your time bank
 MSmits: oh, interesting
 darkhorse64: Plenty of opportunities to build a huge MCTS tree (and to run out of memory)
 MSmits: this is a Nim game
 MSmits: i thought you got points for capturing zones, but you just have to play the last wall
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: also if you solve the game early, you get bonus points for calling the game
 MSmits: like what we do in board games, MSG "WIN"
 MSmits: if you call it out wrong, you lose points
 darkhorse64: Can you call a loss and still win points&#160;?
 AntiSquid: bonus points for successful BM (bad manner opponent by calling early GG)
 MSmits: no i think you just call a win
 eulerscheZahl: calling a loss requires an optimal opponent
 MSmits: or purposely solving to  lose :P
 darkhorse64: just kidding
 MSmits: playing the worst possible move
 AntiSquid: timing out .
 eulerscheZahl: misere nim
 MSmits: well there is that
 eulerscheZahl: yes AntiSquid, that's your discord status
 MSmits: misere nim is really silly, it's the same as being p1 instead of p2 :P
 MSmits: you just flip the parity of the game
 MSmits: instead of playing the last wall, you'll try to get the other to play it
 AntiSquid: as long as i submit a wood bot i can select the tags for a multi :o
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 DomiKo:&#160;???
 AntiSquid:&#160;?????
 Q12:&#160;???????
 DomiKo: i see pattern there
 eulerscheZahl: as in: edit the contribution?
 AntiSquid: no the tags displaying on your front page
 AntiSquid: when you submit a wood bot to any game you can select the tags as your skills
 eulerscheZahl: i haven't submitted anything since that part of the homepage rework
 AntiSquid: and you don't even need to submit
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/ulx080">https://prnt.sc/ulx080</a>

 DomiKo: great tags
 AntiSquid: it doesn't even fit all of them in there
 eulerscheZahl: you practiced a lot of skills :o
 AntiSquid: just need to have a multi with machine learning related tags now
 eulerscheZahl: you seem to be a much better player than me, i'll be watching out for you in the next contest
 AntiSquid: ya but you only need to submit starter code bot and it's enough
 DomiKo: euler how Sokoban is going?
 Brevis: what's that?
 AntiSquid: a chocolate brand
 eulerscheZahl: pretty much done with the game itself
 eulerscheZahl: i want a solver before i put it up for approval
 eulerscheZahl: possibly simplify the levels
 eulerscheZahl: and that nasty CG bug...
 DomiKo: have you thought about making it optimization?
 eulerscheZahl: on the last weekend i added animations and a background
 eulerscheZahl: what should be optimized? number of steps?
 DomiKo: yes
 eulerscheZahl: too BFS-able i think
 eulerscheZahl: so i predict some optimal scores
 eulerscheZahl: the sad thing is that a puzzle will hardly get any attention
 eulerscheZahl: see space maze
 DomiKo: I had that task in the lecture, and I guess big maps couldn't be solved with bfs.
 eulerscheZahl: no, probably not
 eulerscheZahl: but with some help (possibly by hand), i think the optimal solution is doable
 DomiKo: hmmm
 DomiKo: so sad sbout space maze&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: that's another game which is hard to solve at all but not much harder to find an optimal solution
 eulerscheZahl: and it just gets lost in the pool of other problems
 AntiSquid: didn't even try it
 eulerscheZahl: i gave up on the multiple car version

 eulerscheZahl: not an impressive profile overall but did really well at space maze
 eulerscheZahl: i ran the code, solves much faster than mine
 mel-mouk: Hi, I've got a (probably stupid)  question, I'm trying to use machine learning for one of the gameBut event though my algorithm is short ( &lt; 30 lines ), the more it learn the biggest the data I need to make it work is and the size limite for the code is blocking me, is there a way to make a request from the code we submit so I don't have to hardcode my data&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: nope, you have to put your weights into the code
 HackingIsntHacking: You could use a folder with shortcuts to the files required in your code, but depending on your programming language this may cause a failure, check your language before trying.
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article#passing-the-100ko-code-size-limit">https://github.com/pb4git/Nash-DQN-CSB-Article#passing-the-100ko-code-size-limit</a>
 mel-mouk: ok thanks&#160;:) I'll look that up
 HackingIsntHacking: Yeah but really @eulerscheZahl is correct, you should probably just use a wait
 MSmits: well this is annoying. I wrote my own hashtable and tested it, 9999 times it gives the same result as unordered set, only 1 time it's different =/
 mel-mouk: Yeah, I tried a simple version with score for state but I'll have to look how to turn that into usable weight
 eulerscheZahl: good enough, let's ship it
 MSmits: lol
 DomiKo: 200 lvl in Number Shifting that's enough of copy pasting for today
 eulerscheZahl: wow, another one refusing my script
 eulerscheZahl: but well done for reaching such a high level
 DomiKo: WAIT
 DomiKo: there is a script????
 Astrobytes: You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol, you didn't know?
 eulerscheZahl: i link it in the statement
 DomiKo: OMGGGG
 DomiKo: IT IS
 eulerscheZahl: a python program that calls your solver, playes the solution on CG
 DomiKo: I guess 
 eulerscheZahl: then loads the next level and runs your solver again
 DomiKo: that a lesson for me
 DomiKo: to read the whole statement
 eulerscheZahl: read that statement&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: The Curse of Ceg
 Scarfield: lol i thought thats why you asked westi if he had copy pasted all those times xD
 DomiKo: I feel so dumb....
 DomiKo: but
 DomiKo: I'm happy that I know this know
 DomiKo: and not in next 300 lvls...
 Astrobytes: And you have a nice score
 eulerscheZahl: Uljahn did 100 levels by hand in case you didn't know
 DomiKo: so I have a record
 DomiKo: I guess
 eulerscheZahl: copied it to the github.io site, solved there, imported the solution
 Astrobytes: I only did 70
 eulerscheZahl: do you know about the github.io or did you miss that too?
 Scarfield: he didnt use a script to solve the lvls, didnt machet-e go futher?
 Astrobytes: by hand? not sure
 Astrobytes: I thought it was only me and uljahn who were so masochistic
 eulerscheZahl: i think Uljahn is the highest ranked human player
 Scarfield: ye by hand, maybe i just remembered it being marchet instead of ulja
 eulerscheZahl: and wes was still copy-pasting levels, didn't get the python script running
 eulerscheZahl: marchete got quite far by hand (&gt;50)
 AntiSquid: i am highest ranked D player 1/2
 MSmits: I liked that NS taught me dancing links. Nice algorithm
 eulerscheZahl: but tried dancing links and also simulated annealing after
 eulerscheZahl: i imported a DLX library :innocent:
 MSmits: SA works great from 0-200 or so
 MSmits: err DLX
 AntiSquid: number shifting looks like a crypto miner at first glance
 MSmits: well SA too
 Astrobytes: He used some early acceptance variant right?
 MSmits: why crypto miner?
 Astrobytes: *late acceptance
 Astrobytes: (marchet I mean)
 DomiKo: Euler I have problem with script
 DomiKo: I singup from google+&#160;:(
 Uljahn: eulerscheZahl: woudn't be possible without your browser NS helper
 Astrobytes: ^ it's great
 eulerscheZahl: first time I used pixi.js
 jacek: dancing links?
 eulerscheZahl: wouldn't recomment, 4 out of 10 points
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8</a>
 Westicles: heh heh, sorry DomiKo I didn't realize you were asking if a script exists
 Astrobytes: Does hog memory though, guess that's the pixi
 eulerscheZahl: recommend*
 DomiKo: that's my bad :disappointed:
 eulerscheZahl: yes, pixi is a nightmare regarding RAM
 eulerscheZahl: even without any movement animations
 Westicles: Please get to 999, I thought dbdr would do it but he seems reluctant to finish
 eulerscheZahl: so, let's see how good DomiKo is at installing python libraries
 DomiKo: right now
 jacek: number shifting by hand? and now by script? so now it is number caps lock?
 DomiKo: I don't know my CG password
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: stored in the browser?
 DomiKo: I sign up by google
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 DomiKo: I can log by password from google
 DomiKo: buttt
 jacek: you can reset password
 DomiKo: that's not password in my CG proffile
 eulerscheZahl: i think you can turn it into a real account via forgot password
 Scarfield: share your google password here, im sure someone can help you :p
 jacek: dupa.8
 Astrobytes: "XD"
 Scarfield: xD
 DomiKo: mypassword is: ICantReadStatement
 Scarfield: have you met Ceg?
 DomiKo: Ceg?
 Astrobytes: Yes, you have The Curse of Ceg
 Astrobytes: regarding reading statements
 AntiSquid: what's a statement
 eulerscheZahl: remind me of my beginning on hacker.orgthere are similar puzzles where you have to solve a level to unlock the next. it's meant to be solved in code but I didn't realize at first
 DomiKo: yes it WORK
 DomiKo: Script is running
 eulerscheZahl: also had some UI to play as a human. So i wrote code to click buttons in my browser
 DomiKo: Life is so easy now
 jacek: and now euler has your password
 Astrobytes: same euler, though I quite liked playing some of them by hand
 DomiKo: Euler now can copy my better score :neutral_face:
 AntiSquid: hey i didn't read ocean of code statement properly until like 1 week in so it's more about paying attention to details imo
 eulerscheZahl: and after reading level 100 it tells you that you don't play by hand anyways and doesn't show the board anymore
 eulerscheZahl: scared me that they detected my bot and blocked me :rofl:
 Astrobytes: lol
 <b>**eulerscheZahl could cheat himself to #1 at number shifting</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: i know the secret random seed used for board generation
 eulerscheZahl: didn't find a way without me knowing&#160;:(
 MSmits: it works! My custom made hashtable make the code almost 2x faster&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: wow, nice!
 Scarfield: nice
 DomiKo: damn
 Scarfield: so 1million in 32ms? :o
 Astrobytes: faster than what? 
 eulerscheZahl: now push it back to the C++ library
 AntiSquid: so if you reverse the seed then it's enough to beat numbershifting? 
 MSmits: no it's 1 million endgames in about 60-80 seconds
 Astrobytes: Oh you normally use unordered_map right
 eulerscheZahl: yes AntiSquid
 MSmits: for the first 10k endgames, the slowest is 16 ms now, it was 32 ms before
 MSmits: yeah, or unordered set
 eulerscheZahl: that even happened at first
 MSmits: this is so much better
 MSmits: I need to rewrite some bots I think :P
 eulerscheZahl: then i had to change it from Java.Random to SecureRandom
 Astrobytes: that's what I was trying to tell you ages ago MSmits
 MSmits: yeah it just seemed like it was hard, but it's not
 Astrobytes: No, it's literally documented everywhere&#160;;)
 MSmits: i thought it was some specialist type of coding 
 MSmits: sure
 Astrobytes: nah
 MSmits: i coded it in 10 mins, converting from a version with unordered set, just took me an hour to find a bug
 Astrobytes: good job&#160;:)For D&amp;B still right?
 MSmits: yeah, solver works fine now. It's ready to be put into a bot i think, but it's a lot of work to get that done
 jacek: so whats the different? you went from map to unordered_map?
 MSmits: unordered set to my own hashtable
 Astrobytes: cool, well, get on it then :P
 MSmits: I use an array with 100k entries and generate a hashkey with a simple xor function, then use modulo to index to the array
 Scarfield: aah lol the slowest was 65ms before, im amazed how much i can misenterperate sometimes xD
 MSmits: i overwrite collisions
 MSmits: 65 ms out of 1 million
 MSmits: 32 ms out of 10k
 MSmits: the more seeds I try, the more rare maps i find that are slow
 MSmits: I suspect if i do 100 million seeds i might still find one over 100 ms
 MSmits: so just in case, I need to put some code in to play a move on some extreme map
 MSmits: average map takes 0.1 ms so i can actually solve on average 1000 maps per turn, but there could be 1 really slow 1
 jacek: imagine him working on cancer research
 Scarfield: find a bunch of the slow ones, hardcode them, profit
 MSmits: Scarfield I thought about trying to figure out the size of the statespace. Maybe thats feasible
 Astrobytes: lol jacek. Cured in weeks.
 MSmits: that would be cool, but dots and boxes is more fun i think :P
 Scarfield: if it can be done with xor, smits would be the one to figure it out :p
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: bitboards
 MSmits: jacek, you could use your ML creativity to cure cancer, that's probably a lot more useful than whatever I am doing 
 jacek: im already trying to bioengineer cat girls
 Scarfield: imagine having the cure for cancer named after a pony :p
 Hjax: i feel like the true use of smits talent is if aliens ever come to earth and challenge us to an obscure board game 
 MSmits: ahhh ok, priorities eh
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: lol Hjax
 MSmits: Hjax yeah!
 jacek: Hjax like ramsey number?
 AntiSquid: probably the patient data being anonymized and hardly available is the main difficulty
 DomiKo: Aliens never will challenge us with MSmith's opening books
 MSmits: maybe at some point ML will get so obscure that it will be hacking into hospital DB's without anyone knowing :P
 Hjax: i can imagine it now, the other aliens gossiping about how hard one species got smoked 
 Hjax: and saying, maybe we just leave earth alone.... they are made of meat anyway 
 Hjax: (please someone get that reference) 
 MSmits: aliens are veggies?
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html">https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html</a>
 MSmits: thats funny
 Hjax: its one of my favorite short stories 
 Astrobytes: lol, that's epic
 jacek: thats interesting research paper file:///home/jacek/manuscript.pdf
 MSmits: is that in the same folder as your manifest.pdf&#160;?
 Hjax: " Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone."
 Hjax: i love that line
 MSmits: I like the one about traveling in meatcontainers
 Hjax: lol
 Astrobytes: Hey, if you use the CG SDK on an Apple, do you have to edit your pomme.xml?
 jacek: pomme?
 MSmits: isn't that an apply?
 Hjax: french for apple lol
 MSmits: apple?
 Astrobytes: (french for apple)
 Astrobytes: pomme.xml / pom.xml / CG is French / Apple etc
 Hjax: one of the few words i remember from high school french 
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: baguette
 Astrobytes: Just when you mentioned manifest it made me think of pom.xml MSmits
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: It's been a long day, expect no good jokes from me
 MSmits: same here. I've been painting all weekend
 Astrobytes: All done?
 Hjax: multilingual jokes are pretty hard to make work, you are really limiting your target audience 
 MSmits: well not all, but enough so we can live there and paint the rest later
 MSmits: i'm moving in on friday
 Astrobytes: true Hjax
 Astrobytes: Cool, good luck with the move
 MSmits: thanks
 jacek: actually, this one is better <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322530755_Analysis_and_Qualitative_Effects_of_Large_Breasts_on_Aerodynamic_Performance_and_Wake_of_a_Miss_Kobayashi&#39;s_Dragon_Maid_Character">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322530755_Analysis_and_Qualitative_Effects_of_Large_Breasts_on_Aerodynamic_Performance_and_Wake_of_a_Miss_Kobayashi's_Dragon_Maid_Character</a>
 Hjax: i can tell you without clicking that 
 Hjax: thats about lucoa 
 MSmits: did you need this paper for your bioengineering jacek?
 Astrobytes: wtf
 Hjax: aka Quetzalcoatl
 jacek: i need some inspiratio
 jacek: n
 Scarfield: btw Hjax your Floyd Warshall for kutulu took 300ms ish? are you BFS from point to point?
 Astrobytes: Mythical Aztec Dragon Maid what?
 Scarfield: and great story xD
 Hjax: dragon maid is a fantasy anime about an office worker who accidentially drunkenly invites a dragon to live with her 
 Hjax: also a manga 
 Hjax: its really funny 
 Astrobytes: I see
 Hjax: fantasy/comedy 
 MSmits: I see that this paper is serious
 Hjax: the dragon can take a human form, but doesnt really understand human customs 
 Astrobytes: Happens to me every time I drink.
 MSmits: it is why I don't
 Astrobytes: Right.
 Hjax: actually one of my favorite anime, its really light hearted and funny 
 Hjax: pretty popular too 
 Hjax: reddit LOVED that paper when it first came out 
 Astrobytes: Familiar concept Hjax, I can see the comedy value
 Hjax: one of the most upvoted posts on /r/anime ever lol 
 MSmits: well it kinda legitimized their hobby as a scientific field
 Hjax: @Scarfield my full map BFS takes ~150 ms 
 Hjax: its not particularly optimized either 
 AntiSquid: weirdest paper i've looked at
 Scarfield: but are you BFSing with a start and end pos for every distance. Made a function yesterday that just floodfills from the start, tracks the dist and applies it. takes 5ms (unless i did something wrong with the timing but dont think so)
 MSmits: mmh 1% collision rate on my hashtable. Is that bad?
 Hjax: no i just run a full map BFS for every start point
 AntiSquid: look at all the research they've done LOL&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/kleshZc">https://imgur.com/a/kleshZc</a>
 DomiKo: that's well prepared one
 Scarfield: hm weird, thats a lot of time difference, havent done any optim either
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3aa05d4e-165e-4097-b414-8997431bf8d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3aa05d4e-165e-4097-b414-8997431bf8d3</a>
 Hjax: i just call this once on every position of the map 
 jacek: "im a scientist, mum, not a weeb"
 Hjax: technically that bfs is happy to wrap around the map 
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: but kutulu always has blockers around the edge
 Hjax: so it doesnt matter 
 DomiKo: yap
 DomiKo: kutulu is crap
 Hjax: i saw you got legend though DomiKo
 Hjax: gj
 Astrobytes: Do I detect a bitter sentiment DomiKo? :D
 DomiKo: sentiment? nahhh
 DomiKo: I'm glad that it's done
 Hjax: do you do a search DomiKo
 DomiKo: yes
 Hjax: i never got around to writing one 
 Hjax: was trying to get legend with just heuristics, but got busy at the end of the weak and didnt add much
 Hjax: week*
 DomiKo: I never liked doing full heuristics
 DomiKo: in Silver I started writing MC
 AntiSquid: domiko is done how? 
 DomiKo: contest is done
 AntiSquid: you submit spammed after "contest"
 AntiSquid: and never signed up either
 DomiKo: I wanted to get some more CP
 Hjax:&#160;? he was on the leaderboard
 DomiKo: because i knew that my code could reach top12
 DomiKo: i was 12 7H before end of contest
 DomiKo: and then I resubmit
 DomiKo: and top30...
 Hjax: im using most of the heuristics i found on the post mortems, but not legend 
 Hjax: i think my weights just suck 
 Scarfield: lol i thought the contest was 2 weeks, sigh
 Hjax: i wish it was longer, 7 days is way too short 
 Hjax: i only had 1 weekend to work on my bot 
 Astrobytes: Hjax, also, what worked during the actual contest doesn't always fully work as effectively in the multi
 Hjax: true 
 AntiSquid: there was an extra 4 weeks after contest 
 Hjax: especially with a game thats as dependent on other bots as this one 
 Astrobytes: yep
 AntiSquid: that was the old system of opening league on multi separately
 AntiSquid: stronger bosses
 Hjax: ah, they changed the bosses 
 Hjax: that explains why the gold boss is such a bully 
 Hjax: euler too strong 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, now the leaderboard positions are the same as the contest when pushed to multi
 MSmits: not exactly. I am 16th :P
 DomiKo: ohhh no can't solve lvl 231&#160;:(
 MSmits: yeah those levels are hard
 DomiKo: I guess i finally have to optimize something
 DomiKo: but I can guess that lvl 500+ are insane
 Westicles: What are you using, dancing links? 
 DomiKo: still SA
 Hjax: what are you playing? 
 DomiKo: I don't know yet what is Dancing Links
 DomiKo: Number Shifting
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I mean when the multi opens after contest :P
 DomiKo: trying to do someting in every opti
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: i didnt do stuff by hand in NS, but I went all the way on Bilbo
 MSmits: rank 50 out of 9221 players with a manual solution :P
 MSmits: should probably have just beamsearched it though, one of those validators was reeeeallly painful
 Ma.Ay: Does someone know how you can print in js in one row and not in a new line?
 NOTsteve: I usually add to an array then join
 Q12: I don't, but when I need to do it I just make an empty string with and add to him what I wanna print
 Q12: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc2f5b9f-e136-4304-8ae7-09530b2e4c83">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cc2f5b9f-e136-4304-8ae7-09530b2e4c83</a>
 Q12: Like this
 Unkmar: don't print.  Store it in a string and print later.
 Unkmar: That way you can print when you have a complete line.  that is the only way.
 RobkePila: pX
 Unkmar: I have problems with Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?  I've manually tracked through and it looks as though the 3rd test is flawed.
 Lafihalas: Hey guys
 Lafihalas: How does friction work
 Lafihalas: In coders strike back
 Lafihalas: I am trying to model it as F=-k*V, but i am failing a bit short
 Lafihalas: I got the k to be 0.15, but when i try to compute velocity for next step, i get wrong answer when the craft is turning
 darkhorse64: speed *= 1-friction
 Lafihalas: Does the craft first turn around and then gain speed increase due to thrust or vice versa
 Lafihalas: (by its 18 degree turning limit presumably)
 chick_magnet: how are the rankings calculated? solve time or character count? 
 jacek: clash? depends on mode. its fastest, shortest or reverse
 CosmicStudios: Reverse dosen't make sense in clasj
 JBM: clasjing doesn't make sense in reverse: jsalc
 CosmicStudios: I can only do one console.log(); (Javscript)
 CosmicStudios: once I do a second the frst one don't work anymore
 WyattSpur15: nextCheckpointDistance, idk what this means I can't calculate what it means or want
 elderlybeginner: Which bot puzzle is the easiest to get to the legend league?
 DomiKo: it depends
 DomiKo: what is the easiest for you
 elderlybeginner: it always depends&#160;:)
 DomiKo: definitely not kutulu
 elderlybeginner: well, you are giving me opposite answers&#160;:)
 DomiKo: my first one was "Tron Battle" I believe
 elderlybeginner: or answer for opposite question&#160;:)
 elderlybeginner: Great Escape? Codes Strike Back?
 DomiKo: Codes Strike Back it's pretty hard
 DomiKo: Grat Escape i don't know
 DomiKo: Wonder Woman
 DomiKo: it's quite simple
 DomiKo: simple minmax
 elderlybeginner: I got the closest in CSB. Thanks, I will look on WW and Tron
 AntiSquid: CSB isn't hard just keep tweaking those numbers
 AntiSquid: almost 900 in CSB legend .
 Zenoscave: CSB is the easiest legend tbh
 elderlybeginner: yes, I believe I could get there without simulating the game
 Zenoscave: there's a reason it's the tutorial
 DomiKo: then sorry for misleading
 elderlybeginner: still, WW and Tron to be check&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: This is just my opinion. doesn't mean you're misleading DomiKo&#160;:)
 WyattSpur15: I'm not understanding what Ghost in a cell is asking me?
 DomiKo: that's weird
 DomiKo: my first try of SA in A*Craft
 DomiKo: like 2 mouth ago
 DomiKo: I get 5.5K points
 DomiKo: now I wrote it from the begining and boom
 DomiKo: 9.5K points
 Unkmar: I give up on Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.  From what I can tell, the 3rd test is flawed.
 solution.cpp: I will try it now
 solution.cpp: Automaton2000 how are you today
 Automaton2000: and i'm not sure why it works so well
 elderlybeginner: cannot find numpy implementation for flood fill; is it possible to gain some performance using it?

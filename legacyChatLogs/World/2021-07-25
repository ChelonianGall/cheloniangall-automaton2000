 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: MSmits could you help me with something?&#160;:)
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I have a function to calculate the values of the next turn:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: def calcNext(list): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/900f0b11-da86-4d70-aa1a-b464d02e66ec">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/900f0b11-da86-4d70-aa1a-b464d02e66ec</a>
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: I made the input and output both lists so I can plug it into the function multiple times to predict multiple turns ahead
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Are there any errors you can spot?
 dbdr: Illedan?
 DaNinja: MaliciouslyCrypticUsername atan2 returns the angle in radians between  PI and -PI
 DaNinja: need to convert it to degrees
 DaNinja: and subtract your pod current angle to get the angle to target
 halloweens: guys, how to see the code that ppl submitted to the leaderborad, I can't find one in the mars lander optimization
 DaNinja: you cant see other solutions for optimizations
 halloweens: okay then, thank you btw
 Diptastic: fyi Chuck Norris' keyboard has 2 keys: 0 and white space.
 Illedan: yes dbdr?
 Illedan: Solved 1 food map now?
 Marchete: "will code for food"
 struct: "will give food for eval"
 martinpapa69: ok, so feeding binary encoded integers to nn does not work
 Marchete: hmm, as one-hots :D
 Marchete: but (float)(intval)
 martinpapa69: ye sounded like a smart idea. but it just..baD
 Marchete: I don't thin so
 Marchete: afaik NN search gradients
 Marchete: so it assumes -1 bad 1 good
 Marchete: and all between are gradients
 Marchete: for turn?
 Marchete: I thought about some turn%12 (a full rotation)
 Marchete: then some encoding
 dbdr: Illedan you appeared online, I guess you just left your machine running&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: hm. i used it for cell values
 dbdr: not solved 1 and 2, but made a few optims. and thought about odd levels, but not implemented anything
 Illedan: Yeah&#160;:) Tend to happen. Every day
 Illedan: I started the JS thingy atleast, hopefully done tonight&#160;:)
 OldJohn: @matrinpapa69 yes binaries values of integer does not work easily with oware since it is harder to encode necessary if conditions such that if cell_value[5] = 13 and cell_value[6]=0 and ...&#160;: Here onehot encoding is perfect. That ma explain why onehot is better here. However, it is natural when you have just to use add,minus,multiply and so one on input values which is often the case with NN in real life.
 OldJohn: OneHot is perfect for categorical values&#160;:-) A, cat, dog. And here in fact it is nearly categorical inputs&#160;:-)
 jacek: and it will grab the concept that empty house, or 1-2 seeds houses are much different than the others
 jacek: implicit little domain knowledge
 jacek: + it's faster
 martinpapa69: the information is still there in binary encoding, but ye the network needs to use more weights to learn, when a house has x seeds. i thought after long training it could be maybe possible to teach it, so i can save space
 dbdr: if you need more weights, it might not save space
 martinpapa69: I mean. if you use one-hot, the network needs 1 weight, to know if you have lets say 5 seeds in slot 1
 martinpapa69: but if you use binary encoding, needs more
 Marchete: how do you encode a binary on a float?
 martinpapa69: input[0] = val^0
 martinpapa69: input[1] = val^1
 Marchete: so each bit on 1 input float?
 martinpapa69: yep
 Marchete: ahhh
 Marchete: ok, then maybe it's ok
 martinpapa69: it worked...but performed much worse
 struct: story of my life
 jacek: oO

 jacek: quite speed vs accuracy tradeoff in sf14
 struct: so i must make my bt bot slower
 struct: got it
 OldJohn: Did you find on which games NNUE is trained&#160;?
 jacek: just reading random snippsets from sf discord
 jacek: but lately theyve been training on leela zero games as well
 OldJohn: OK so singular extensions on MCTS does not improve the edngame play too much
 MSmits: it should not, because the endgame is usually solved
 MSmits: if neumann pops in, tell him his cg bench overrides my request cooldown
 MSmits: requestCooldown: 80
 MSmits: it does 30
 MSmits: and then hits the limit
 MSmits: it will then double the 30 and keep doubling it until it no longer hits the limit. I prefer to just set a value that never hits it
 jrke: MSmits thanks for pushing me 3rd in D&amp;B lol
 MSmits: yeah, you know how i do that?
 MSmits: I have a mcts for early game
 MSmits: and I can make it create a ton of loops and short chains if i want to
 MSmits: in that case, it doesnt help to be in control in the late game
 MSmits: your bot is better than other bots at playing out the late game
 MSmits: you get wins vs me
 MSmits: I did some testing and i get around 50% wr vs mikla with this
 MSmits: unfortunately a bunch of losses vs lower ranked, like you
 MSmits: you'll see the games you won are all narrow score wins
 MSmits: score solver paying off in the end eh?
 jrke: my current submitted bot is having end game solver which is bugged intensionally to make it work under 100ms
 jrke: and the non-bugged solver is ready but it takes 100ms+ in many games
 jrke: so can't submit it
 MSmits: I know your pain. Spent a lot of time speeding up mine
 MSmits: it's hard
 MSmits: btw i recommend you also do the mcts thing
 jrke: i in my solver i only evaluate heuristically in which only closed chains are there
 MSmits: it's really easy, just do a basic mcts and your eval just has to make an educated guess about how "loopy shortchainy" it is
 jrke: i think adding looped chains in that can optimize it a bit
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: do you need the function i shared with Marchete
 jrke: which one?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3536899d-1ad3-4f09-9e70-e9ab1aa0699f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3536899d-1ad3-4f09-9e70-e9ab1aa0699f</a>
 MSmits: ControlledValue(int b, int l4, int ll, int c3, int cl)
 MSmits: b is boxes left, l4 is loop4count, c3 is chain3count, cl is number of long chains
 MSmits: assuming all are isolated
 MSmits: so no fancy 3 joins and 4 joins
 MSmits: this is an exact solution coming from scientific research
 MSmits: and extremely fast
 MSmits: oh and ll is long loops
 MSmits: (6+
 MSmits: the end result is the board value
 struct: o.o
 jrke: thenks
 MSmits: dont try to understand it really, just test it
 MSmits: make sure you handle short chains (1 and 2 long)
 MSmits: and also chains that have been opened already
 MSmits: once those are gone, you can use the formula
 MSmits: I kinda understood it when i coded it, but have no clue now
 jrke: int GetValueRecursive(int b, int l4, int ll, int c3, int cl)
 jrke: what does this do?
 MSmits: thats the function you call
 MSmits: it calculates the value of the board
 MSmits: pass it the boxcount left on the board
 MSmits: and the loop4count
 MSmits: looplongcount (6+)
 MSmits: chain3count
 MSmits: and chainlongcount(4+)
 MSmits: it's recursive in the sense that it calls itself multiple times in case of 4 loops
 MSmits: removing loops each time
 jrke: does l4 consist all loops count or just  loops of 4 boxes?
 MSmits: loops of 4 boxes
 MSmits: they are special
 MSmits: chains of 3 also
 MSmits: btw tb = terminal bonus, it's the bonus you get from capturing the last object
 MSmits: because you dont need to give up boxes in that one
 MSmits: 4 loops have a tb of 8
 MSmits: normall you give away 4 boxes, but on the last one you gain 4
 MSmits: 4 -- 4 = 8
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: I dont mind giving you the paper this all comes from but it's one of the worst you'll have ever read
 MSmits: not because it's wrong, but because it's textwalls with math sprinkled
 jrke: my current heuristic eval is here
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c165b37e-ef23-4ebd-af91-bbb528491e13">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c165b37e-ef23-4ebd-af91-bbb528491e13</a>
 MSmits: yeah that will have similar speed, but will be wrong some of the time
 jrke: but i looped handler is incomplete
 jrke: else {}
 MSmits: oh right
 MSmits: well thats where the complexity is
 MSmits: if you have only chains you can just always play the shortest one
 MSmits: if you also have loops,then sometimes it's better to play a 4 loop first, sometimes a 3 chain
 jrke: yeah
 MSmits: btw
 jrke: btw i calculated how many unique states can be in dots and boxes
 MSmits: if you just have loops you can also just always play 1 and 2 chains before loops
 jrke: ohk
 MSmits: around 6000 if you have simple loony endgames right?
 MSmits: i created lookup tables for this
 MSmits: and i needed 6000 sized array
 MSmits: but my lookup table was slower
 jrke: no i am talking every state of game from turn 0 to turn 112
 MSmits: oh I see
 jrke: 2^112 if i am not wrong
 jrke: cause we can define each state under 112 bits
 MSmits: hmm well yes thats the first order calculation
 jrke: and all combinations will be 2^112
 MSmits: but you dont include symmetry in that
 MSmits: 2^3 ways to rotate and mirror
 MSmits: so that'll make it 2^109
 jrke: yes no symmetry in that
 jrke: ohk
 MSmits: also the corners have a little bit of symmetry
 MSmits: but that's mostly negligible
 MSmits: the game is mostly simplified by it's graph-nature
 MSmits: once you have isolated chains it doesnt matter where they are
 jrke: yeah
 jrke: just play smaller ones
 MSmits: also even with complex objects, you can do all sorts of rotations and twisting and it will stay the same object
 MSmits: so many D&amp;B maps are equivalents
 MSmits: but in your case, if you dont like using that function i just gave you, you can also generate all possible states and use a lookup table
 MSmits: generate them all locally
 MSmits: you'll have 6k values
 MSmits: compress them and put them in your bot
 MSmits: then in the first second, generate the states, but dont solve them
 MSmits: instead add the hardcoded value to those states in a lookup table
 jrke: i will only hardcode when i failed to make solver working under 100ms after trying too many things
 MSmits: well you cant hardcode complex stuff so this is just to replace that function
 jrke: how you handle loops bigger than 4?
 MSmits: 6 loops are "somewhat" special, but only in the presence of complex objects
 jrke: btw loops have only even numbered boxes right?
 MSmits: anything bigger can just be ignored until the final solve of a simple state
 MSmits: jrke yes in D&amp;B they do
 MSmits: I also ignore all chains 4 and up
 MSmits: during solve
 MSmits: except in the final use of that function
 jrke: maybe one reason of slow speed of my solver could be this
 jrke: int map[7][7][4]
 MSmits: sure
 jrke: i am using 7*7*4 array for game state
 MSmits: I generate a graph from my map
 MSmits: so i am no longer placing edges during solve
 MSmits: i am playing whole loops and chains and such

 struct: how can a 1 line eval have like 40% win rate vs my current bot
 struct: ....
 MSmits: yes that's very disturbing
 MSmits: I also dont know how to eval breakthrough
 struct: I dont know how to eval.
 struct: Doesnt matter which game
 MSmits: eval in general is just, identify features, give them a parameter, fit the parameters
 MSmits: identifying features is the only hard part
 MSmits: the rest is boring and time consuming
 jrke: i went at wrong path for evaluating func in spring 2021 during contest
 MSmits: i succeeded at it in some games, most notably oware
 MSmits: until everyone and their mom beat me using NN
 dbdr: you handcrafted an oware eval?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: far better than the rest
 snacker_X: print("hello world")
 struct: dbdr you eval breakthrough?
 jrke: what depth you go in oware MS?
 dbdr: honestly I don't remember how I eval bt
 MSmits: no idea, it depends on the state of the game, probably 20 or so
 MSmits: it's mcts with ept
 struct: But you do eval right?
 dbdr: I guess
 dbdr: sorry, it's in swap right now
 struct: swap?

 dbdr: oh, I think I know!
 dbdr: yeah, finishing levels again now&#160;:)
 MSmits: is this one of those GA/SA games?
 dbdr: we don't know yet&#160;:)
 jrke:  Hamiltonian cycle is easiest way to solve snake game until and unless you don't have turn boundation
 MSmits: I dont think it's supposed to be solvable
 MSmits: so you need some optimization algorithm
 billalxcode: verse mode
 MSmits: it's like the travelling salesman problem
 MSmits: quickly grows in complexity with the number of food thingies
 MSmits: I suppose you can solve a few simpler cases exactly using that hamiltonian thingy and then use them as a benchmark for your optimization
 dbdr: solved as in: found a way to visit all cities
 MSmits: no i mean maximum score
 dbdr: not found the probable optimal one
 dbdr: I know
 MSmits: with TSP anything &lt; 20 is possible to solve exactly I think
 MSmits: not sure where the exact limit is
 dbdr: when jrke says solved, he does not mean optimally
 MSmits: It's (N-1)! / 2  I think
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: did not get that
 jrke: yeah i didn't meant optimal
 MSmits: soo I know how i can get to nr 1 in D&amp;B now
 struct: o.o
 MSmits: I just spam a 51% wr bot forever and pull down mila
 MSmits: mikla 
 dbdr: lol
 MSmits: and then lose the nr 1 as soon as 1 person resubmits
 MSmits: because my bot loses vs lower ranked, the way i made it now
 dbdr: sounds like a plan
 jrke: and push me up till you push down mikla lol
 MSmits: hehe yea
 dbdr: good use of resources
 MSmits: i am doing that jrke
 MSmits: probably i should just improve my solver so i dont get so many lower ranked losses and get a bit more wins vs mikla as well
 MSmits: my scoresolver currently starts at endgame, but the simple endgames take like 5 microseconds to solve
 jrke: wht thats great 5ms
 MSmits: so plenty of time left to bring the frame of solving earlier
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: on average it's 80 microseconds
 MSmits: oh wait no
 MSmits: thats nim solving
 MSmits: hmm score solving was 1 millisecond average
 MSmits: no, 300 micro
 jrke: :scream:
 MSmits: but the simpler ones are faster than average
 MSmits: and the whole idea is to make the board simple and losing for mikla
 jrke: my solver breaks 100ms when there are more than 15 chains lol
 MSmits: the number of chains is irrelevant for me, just the number of 4 and 3 degree joins matters
 jrke: i have minimax thingy for solver
 MSmits: some of them are crazy complicated. I found one with 12 joins that took the full 100 ms
 MSmits: yeah mine uses negamax, which is basically minimax
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572083224">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572083224</a> frame 61, this took 111 microseconds to solve
 jrke: my internet is working like snail
 jrke: very slow
 MSmits: ye, looking at the games on the leaderboard 100 micro is average for solving time when no safe moves are left
 MSmits: but this is with my loopy mcts that creates simple endgames
 jrke: nice
 MSmits: yeah so what i was thinking about doing is extending this to before the endgame
 MSmits: with another negamax that runs the solver at endgame
 jrke: i am very much interesed to know what does crazy remi prints in message
 MSmits: problem is you need sacrifice moves and pre-emptive sacrifices as well
 MSmits: me too, i have no idea
 MSmits: his bot is very weird
 MSmits: i suspect he uses some sort of mcts with nim-components
 MSmits: without a nimsolver, his bot crushes you, so he does have some nim in there
 jrke: it looks like time taken in seconds
 MSmits: hard to say
 MSmits: ahh gotta go, visitors today
 MSmits: ttyl
 jrke: ohk
 jacek: whats with that utf16
 reCurse: I'm starting to wonder if I should have used randomized openings for chess instead of 960
 struct: unbalanced starts?
 struct: I mean unbalanced on 960
 reCurse: No
 struct: What is the problem?
 reCurse: No problem per se
 reCurse: Doing most of my testing with random chess engines and most of them just do classic chess
 reCurse: So I use random openings and it's working pretty well
 reCurse: And it's easier to watch
 reCurse: shrug
 reCurse: Pretty satisfying to defeat minimax engines with positional play
 jacek: random openings, but castling as in classic chess?
 reCurse: It's exactly the same as classic chess except forced openings from a book like they do in most competitions
 struct: im probably done with bt, its impossible to bench atm
 struct: I was not aware it was this bad since I never used cg bench
 MSmits: I get to 48 games and then  it stops, I think authentication fails 
 Marchete: on CGBenchmark?
 MSmits: yeah
 Marchete: hard limits
 Marchete: they are very limited now
 MSmits: not just that
 Marchete: like unusable even with IDE tests
 MSmits: it also logs me out or something
 MSmits: so even with 1 min time
 MSmits: at some point it says i am not the right codingamer
 MSmits: usually after half an hour or so
 struct: I can run brutaltester, but I just end up creating a version that can only beat my bot
 struct: unless I test vs multiple versions of my bots
 MSmits: struct what helps a little bit is adding randomness to your moves
 MSmits: so when making the move, add&#160;% randomness to the value of each move
 Marchete: brutaltester is the "my mom says I'm the best basketball player"
 Marchete: version
 Marchete: just like NN sometimes
 MSmits: yes, fitting params is like that
 MSmits: you can use tricks to reduce overfitting outside of NN's also
 MSmits: well I guess CG bench is not completely useless. I can run it maybe 4 separate times and add up the result for 200 games or so. Then I can at least tell if a bot is obviously better or not. If they're close, it's not enough
 struct: but you are only testing vs 1 player
 struct: on bt that is not enough
 MSmits: in my case that is fine
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: I also have a lot of testing tools for D&amp;B outside of cg bench though, so it's easy for me to see if i improved
 MSmits: i just dont know if its better than mikla
 MSmits: unless i cg bench
 MSmits: my current leaderboard version is 50% WR btw, as far as you can tell with a near even 100-100 score
 MSmits: but it sacrifices a lot vs lower ranked. So my next goal is fixing that
 MSmits: this is typical: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/MSmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/MSmits</a>
 MSmits: all green, but well... I am not supposed to lose any games below mikla
 struct: I would try chess, but if I struggle with bt eval I cant imagine how I would do in chess :D
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: plenty of features to choose from
 MSmits: also more literature
 MSmits: but fitting params is a huge problem
 MSmits: you need to learn how to do that
 MSmits: automatically, not by hand
 struct: I probably need to upgrade my cpu
 struct: if i want to do that
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: sure, it helps
 MSmits: but you can also just wait twice as long
 Marchete: if WR &gt;50 just spam submit :D
 MSmits: or do it less often
 MSmits: Marchete i could get &gt;50 but i want to make it so that i get 100% below me
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/XPxrlIN.png">https://i.imgur.com/XPxrlIN.png</a>
 MSmits: like it was before
 struct: I cant test on ide though anymore
 struct: due to cd
 MSmits: it's literally 1 minus sign between this and being 100%
 struct: cooldown*
 MSmits: but then my mikla wr becomes 40%
 Marchete: yeah sometimes I can beat you on my broken bot :D
 MSmits: thats the sort of loss that should not happen
 MSmits: but there's a difference with your bot
 MSmits: you get loopy maps even if i am not trying for them
 MSmits: so your bot does something
 Marchete: I think it's that
 Marchete: my bot tries something
 Marchete: and by chance it gets the right point to win
 Marchete: like it's still too much randomness
 MSmits: could be
 Marchete: to say you domain the game
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572123960">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/572123960</a>
 MSmits: but i did discover that it's possible to force loopyness. If everyone did that, it would kill miklas bot
 Marchete: at first match I tried
 Marchete: so you have room to improve
 Marchete: or maybe it's just 1st player having advantage
 MSmits: nah not really
 MSmits: i gave away 2 boxes btw
 MSmits: because my bot wants to have control
 MSmits: thats why i lose
 MSmits: control is pointless with loopy maps
 MSmits: I should just detect this and stop sacrificing
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/572086105">https://www.codingame.com/replay/572086105</a>
 MSmits: here i beat mikla like you beat me
 MSmits: let him have control by sacrificing boxes, then win by score
 MSmits: dunno why my happy and sad face emote got broken btw
 Marchete: hmm I thought it was due to the position, but I can win you also as blue player
 MSmits: yeah that doesnt matter
 MSmits: the game has too much branching to make use of any p1 or p2 advantage
 MSmits: and it's impartial
 MSmits: you both use the same board
 MSmits: the only difference is who's turn it is
 Marchete: 5x5 is proven win for p1
 MSmits: sure but this is meaningless if it's not solved
 Marchete: at some point in time it had "too much branching"
 MSmits: 7x7 is also a win for either player
 MSmits: one of them i mean
 MSmits: there is an enormous difference between 5x5 and 7x7
 MSmits: like checkers and chess
 MSmits: 5x5 was not at all easy to solve
 MSmits: mostly because nim stuff is useless for this kind of solving
 MSmits: score solving uses plain old negamax
 MSmits: there's a table somewhere that showed the difference in time required for 4x5 compared to 5x5
 MSmits: it was like 1000 times or something ridiculous like that
 struct: ok maybe this version is better
 struct: now I need to wait for cooldown
 jacek: you cant submit on cooldown?
 MSmits: and then you use your ultimate?
 struct: I wont submit I dont want to lose my top 10&#160;:(
 struct: only if im 100% sure that its better
 struct: It does play different

 struct: 2nd is old bot
 MSmits: i just love we brought you over to the dark side of board-game botting&#160;:)
 struct: I only learned bitboards due to spring contest
 MSmits: you picked it up fast
 struct: I knew the basic like set and clear bits
 struct: but that was about it
 MSmits: thats how it starts
 MSmits: you will also go through a phase where you are bitboarding everything, even when it doesnt help at all
 MSmits: or maybe thats just me
 struct: if its easier sure
 MSmits: earlier I was trying to calculate mex, by setting bits on a bitboard and then using builtin ctzl to get the lowest bit
 struct: mex?
 MSmits: but turns out just filling an array and looping to the lowest unset array item was faster
 MSmits: minimum excluded value
 MSmits: so i started with a full set bitboard
 MSmits: and unset bit
 MSmits: when i found values
 MSmits: then took the minimum set bit with ctzl
 MSmits: but just having an array with 16 values and setting the items was faster
 MSmits: because to modify the bitboard i needed |= 1uLL &lt;&lt; s
 MSmits: and thats slower
 MSmits: slower than just setting an item in a 16 sized array
 MSmits: this is what i meant with unnecessarily bitboarding everything
 reCurse: That seems incredibly specific advice on micro-optimizations heavily dependent on the context they're used in
 MSmits: yes, the point was really, not to jump to bitboards at every occasion
 MSmits: not this specific example
 MSmits: I also did a bitboarded floodfill for tron
 MSmits: which was slower I think
 MSmits: maybe a did it wrong, not sure
 MSmits: I
 reCurse: Probably did it wrong I'd say
 reCurse: Bitboards are very good at that
 MSmits: well maybe, the idea was to floodfill in parallel, but it works poorly on long corridors
 NVT_Nguyen: gg
 MSmits: i did use it on D&amp;B succesfully, but the bitboard is just a single uint64_t
 MSmits: for tron i needed like 29 ints
 MSmits: that complicates things
 MSmits: if you're just floodfilling along 1 corridor on 2 ints and you have to check if your map changed to see if you're done floodfilling, you need to check the whole board
 MSmits: because you dont actually know it's just a corridor
 reCurse: I maintain my guess :P
 MSmits: fair enough&#160;:)
 reCurse: Speaking of benching I was afraid this would happen since the public release of CGBench, still took 2 years eh
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it always surprised me they just let us do it
 MSmits: just a bit worried they might limit submits next
 MSmits: as you mentioned 
 MSmits: well you mentioned that people submit more
 reCurse: During contest yeah
 MSmits: probably also outside contest
 reCurse: That's the thing the site is dead outside contests
 reCurse: That's why it upset me quite when they made the limit permanent
 MSmits: relatively speaking sure
 MSmits: well contests arent happening all the time
 MSmits: there might be more activity outside contest
 MSmits: but it's spread out
 MSmits: over a long period of time
 MSmits: if you limit it there too, you migth save a bunch of $$ in the long term as well
 MSmits: just have to be honest about it
 reCurse: I still think we talk about thousands of times
 MSmits: I remember a time where I personally CG benched 10k games in a week and that was just me alone
 MSmits: outside of contest
 MSmits: in contest i benched less
 reCurse: That's nothing in the grand scheme
 MSmits: nothing if it's just me
 MSmits: we dont really have the numbers, so we can only guess
 MSmits: i just accept the new reality. The new normal is testing locally
 reCurse: The new normal is to leave CG lol
 MSmits: not me&#160;:)
 MSmits: anyways gotta go get some food, ttyl
 reCurse: bye

 jacek: oh my, +350 elo in a year
 struct: it did not look like 350 in this site
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://m.nextchessmove.com/dev-builds/">https://m.nextchessmove.com/dev-builds/</a>
 jacek: different time control maybe
 struct: ah probably
 jacek: plus this is test against last classical sf, which was sf11
 struct: that one is against sf7
 NinjaDoggy: 10 seconds + 0.1 time control ._.
 NinjaDoggy: wtf is that
 struct: ultra bullet
 NinjaDoggy: not sure how meaningful 350 elo at ultra bullet is&#160;:/
 jacek: also, could be different openings
 reCurse: Why wouldn't it be meaningful
 reCurse: Are you saying CG bots aren't meaningful? lol
 sprkrd: 10 sec + 0.1 is plenty for a computer
 sprkrd: most CG games have 100 ms per turn
 reCurse: Anyway I'd rather use CCRL as a reference since they play against various different engines
 darkhorse64: CG is 1s + 0.05 right ,
 darkhorse64:&#160;?
 reCurse: Not really
 reCurse: There's no timebank on CG
 NinjaDoggy: but no  official/ranked games are played at 10 + 0.1 so saying "350 elo increase over sf11"is pretty misleading
 NinjaDoggy: at longer time control the elo gain is much smaller
 reCurse: I don't get it
 sprkrd: I don't understand your point
 reCurse: Elo is always in a frame of reference
 reCurse: By itself it never means anything
 reCurse: Just like I could say self-play elo is meaningless
 reCurse: Doesn't mean it is
 NinjaDoggy: my point is if someone says "SF14 is 350 elo stronger than SF11"most people would think that's it's 350 elo higher in normal time controls for competitive games
 NinjaDoggy: not 350 elo stronger at ultra bullet 10 + 0.1
 reCurse: I disagree since what is the normal time control? TCEC? CCRL? CCRL Blitz?
 reCurse: On what hardware?
 sprkrd: why would be elo be something particular for "competitive human time controls"? It's not even specific to chess
 sprkrd: point is, computer has a budget of 10s to make its move (let's forget about the increment for now), it can manage its budget anyway it wants. Under those circumstances, there's a 350 elo difference between approach A and approach B
 reCurse: It's exactly like saying your new version has 90% winrate vs the old one
 reCurse: What it actually means depends on the context
 struct: If I check the win rate with "random" openings will it be more accurate to check bot strength?
 NinjaDoggy: yes but, if you just say"SF14 is 350 elo stronger than SF11"most people agree SF11 is around 3400-3500 in most time controls used in competitionsbut SF14 is not 3750+
 reCurse: It actually is
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/404/">http://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/404/</a>
 jacek: busted
 jacek: what is fat fritz doing there :s
 reCurse: They decide not to dive in politics
 reCurse: Something like that
 reCurse: shrug
 reCurse: Also the fact the statement says "vs SF11" implies to me self-play which means the measure is in no way usable in regular tables
 reCurse: Because otherwise they'd have to say what is the reference pool used
 NinjaDoggy: I mean... that's my pointthat you shouldn't expect to find in any of these tables stockfish 14 being 350 elo higher than stockfish 11
 reCurse: I don't think anyone is
 reCurse: That's why I don't get the misleading claim, the statement is actually accurate
 NinjaDoggy: yes so saying "350 elo higher" is kind of misleading and imo "not meaningful"
 NinjaDoggy: ok i guess misleading is too far, but not meaningful
 reCurse: If someone says "the new version has 90% winrate vs the previous one" is that misleading?
 reCurse: Because elo == winrat
 reCurse: e
 NinjaDoggy: yea nvm, not misleading just not meaningful&#160;:)
 reCurse: Sure, though if you look in the tables the jump between 11 and 14 is still very meaningful
 reCurse: Whether it's 100 or 300 elo isn't that big of a deal
 reCurse: It's an exponential metric
 NinjaDoggy: not disagreeing the jump is crazy
 NinjaDoggy: but the claim of "350 elo over sf11" is not meaningful imo that's all
 reCurse: Also FWIW my chess bot self-play elo sort of matches CCRL elo as well
 reCurse: So it has value
 struct: chessbase might need a bot
 reCurse: And personally I find there's a lot more value on a chess bot that plays well with less resources than more
 reCurse: But to each his/her/its own
 NinjaDoggy: I agree with like all of your points, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/59f0e64a-ee89-4a72-8289-b92dfbb14632">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/59f0e64a-ee89-4a72-8289-b92dfbb14632</a>
 NinjaDoggy: oops codingame doesn't like essays ._.
 reCurse: I wouldn't fault them for making that statement since it's actually correct and doesn't lead more credence to a format or a competition more than another /srhug
 reCurse: If we have to worry about how everyone can interpret a statement we're actually doing PR work for free
 reCurse: And then you have corpospeak
 reCurse: No one likes that
 reCurse: Haven't they historically always said the elo improvement in self-play for like all their releases?
 sprkrd: actually I somewhat agree with NinjaDoggy. I don't like corpospeak either, but saying "SF14 has a 90% win rate against SF11" is not corpospeak and is both clearer and scientifically accurate
 reCurse:&#160;??
 reCurse: Elo is the exact same thing as winrate
 reCurse: It's just exponential instead of linear
 reCurse: I think you attribute way more to "elo" than it actually means
 reCurse: It's just a unit
 sprkrd: But for elo you need a pool of players
 reCurse: No you don't
 reCurse: You can have elo with just A vs B
 sprkrd: elo when there are two players is just... complicating things unnecessarily
 reCurse: No again
 reCurse: The exponential measure has more value than the linear one
 sprkrd: when you have two players you can report wr be much more straight to the point
 reCurse: Tons of people measure improvement in elo over winrate
 reCurse: I actually found it to be a much better unit after giving it a try
 reCurse: In fact I'd say most release notes I've seen express elo improvement by self-play, otherwise they specifically mention +50 elo in CCRL or whatever
 reCurse: If you need it to be more palatable
 reCurse: 80 vs 90 winrate doesn't seem like much but it's actually huge
 reCurse: The elo unit correctly shows that
 sprkrd: i don't know... I think if I had to report a figure in a paper and there are only two contestants, WR is much more straightforward. Elo is good when you have several players, you assign an elo to each one and then you can estimate the win rate between any two players taking the difference and then the exponential (using the appropriate normalizing factors and all that) 
 sprkrd: if there are only two players, I don't see why elo would be a more intuitive figure
 reCurse: It's less approchable but more useful
 sprkrd: so at first I was with you, now I changed my mind, sorry :cry:
 reCurse: A winrate delta is useless without the winrate basis
 reCurse: A elo delta is always useful
 reCurse: Because 50 vs 55 doesn't tell nearly the same story as 90 vs 95
 sprkrd: I'm talking merely from an outreach point of view. I understand that, as you say, elo would be more useful in your technical work depending on what you're doing. But for communicating scientific findings, maybe WR is clearer? 
 sprkrd: Like, if I say SF14 wins against SF11 90% of the time, wouldn't that be somewhat clearer than saying it has +350 elo points?
 reCurse: You took the original debate and completely changed it to another one
 reCurse: But I think the chess community at large is much more used with elo as measurement so I disagree
 MSmits: Marchete I submitted my non-loopy version again
 sprkrd: I'm sorry if I shifted the debate, I was under the impression that I was making a valid remark, but I don't want to press further, it's not something I care all that much anyway.
 reCurse: No worries I was just saying
 reCurse: Also don't mind me I'm just a cranky jerk :P
 MSmits: I'm a :poodle:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: o.O
 sprkrd: I'm a bit of a cranky jerk too. I'm pretending here, but I actually went to my boxing bag and hit it with all my might imagining it was you :eyes:
 struct: got a lucky submit I guess
 reCurse: Wow ok
 sprkrd: (just kidding :joy:)
 sprkrd: (or not :eyes:)
 struct: I cant beat pamplemus though
 struct: and any NN&#160;:/
 MSmits: wreck those NN
 KiwiTae: sprkrd its not possible we are all nerds nobody doing sports here hehe
 struct: MSmits only possible with a NN im afraid
 reCurse: I guess I'm what they call a people person
 MSmits: hey, i sit on my hometrainer cycle watching netflix a lot
 MSmits: like a pro
 KiwiTae: MSmits you are on ZWIFT?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: MSmits is what we call an "athlete"
 MSmits: is that a machine?
 Astrobytes: Do you also actually cycle or just sit there?
 MSmits: lol Astrobytes
 MSmits: no i actually cycle
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: XD
 KiwiTae: its for virtual rides you can use it with a hometrainer
 MSmits: oh, nah
 MSmits: i just watch some shows i would normally not spend time watching but want to know what happens anyway
 MSmits: to clear my netflix queue
 reCurse: Funny I just stop watching instead
 reCurse: :P
 sprkrd: KiwiTae I wish I could contradict you (regarding the sports bit), but it's been a while I have not done any sport due to a knee injury&#160;:(
 MSmits: you are a more logical person
 sprkrd: since I've done any sport*
 KiwiTae: sprkrd I am recovering from double surgery i got your feelin~
 MSmits: not sure what knee injury you have sprkrd, but mine got better from the cycling
 MSmits: something to do with strengthening muscles i guess
 sprkrd: I actually can do several sports, including cycling, but I had to stop doing judo. Judo was my jam
 reCurse: Intimidation attempt spotted
 MSmits: ahh yeah judo is hard on your body
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wait I just realized I made a stupid mistake in my CSB code-
 Astrobytes: lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: math.atan2 returns radians
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: not degrees
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;:?
 MSmits: i started judo at 2 in diapers, stopped when I was 11
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername:&#160;:/
 sprkrd: reCurse :eyes:
 MSmits: my first real match,i broke my collarbone
 MSmits: was also my last
 sprkrd: D:
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 KiwiTae: ush
 Astrobytes: MSmits: I see the scores are evening out on D&amp;B, near identical winrates?
 MSmits: Astrobytes, i got 2 versions now
 Astrobytes: :rofl: Judo defo not your bag lol
 MSmits: 1 is 50% mikla, 75% vs top 5
 MSmits: 1 is 40% mikla, 100% vs rest
 MSmits: the one up now is the second
 Astrobytes: that's the current one
 Astrobytes: yeah
 reCurse: The way my bot uses its king in the front lines gives me a heart attack sometimes
 MSmits: well kings are harder to mate when they have a lot of room to move :P
 Astrobytes: lol, likes to play edgy moves eh
 sprkrd: how can you expect your subjects to follow if your king doesn't lead?
 reCurse: Surrounded by 2 bishops and a knight but no problem I'll just walk over there
 reCurse: *enemy
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYLeoN7ovnk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYLeoN7ovnk</a>
 MSmits: Astrobytes my hope is to improve version 1 with a better score solver, so i will get top 5 back to near 100% and get mikla slightly above 50%
 Marchete: MSmits :D
 Astrobytes: Your score solver is still the negamax?
 Marchete: I'm "just" 8pts below
 MSmits: yes Astrobytes
 MSmits: but it only starts at endgame
 MSmits: and uses about 0,1 ms
 MSmits: no reason to not start solving sooner
 Astrobytes: I was about to recommend that
 MSmits: but it's a bit complicated to code due to sacrifices and such, what to prove and what not
 MSmits: prune i mean
 MSmits: not prove
 Astrobytes: Seems worth the extra effort
 MSmits: oh, btw, there is another thing i can do to get nr 1
 Astrobytes: spam
 MSmits: first push up top 5 and pull down mikla with version 1
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 MSmits: then do version 2, wreck everyone but  mikla and become nr 1
 Marchete: ezpz
 NinjaDoggy: play the leaderboard&#160;;)
 Marchete: I can spam submit too
 MSmits: yeah, i am relatively safe from that right now, you will hurt mikla more than me
 Astrobytes: that's a wanky move though, and temporary
 MSmits: yeah i would not
 Marchete: 50% winrate him, 0% you
 MSmits: it's because my current bot does the opposite of loopy mcts
 MSmits: so it counteracts your loopyness
 Marchete: :rage:
 MSmits: so i win on nim
 Marchete: that's my unhappy face
 Marchete: I had some 35-40% winrate vs you
 MSmits: yeah thats with loopy
 MSmits: nim becomes useless then
 Astrobytes: loopy?
 MSmits: lots of little 4 loops
 Marchete: lol no
 MSmits: and other simple objects
 Marchete: I'm timeouting
 Marchete: :D
 Astrobytes: Ah right
 struct: msmits just make a donation to marchet paypal
 struct: then you get pushed
 MSmits: hehe
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: at the cost of 1 paper
 MSmits: ohh
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: i notice i still get loops vs toy
 MSmits: you
 MSmits: so the counteracting is not working very well
 MSmits: why are you timeouting
 MSmits: i mean, you got to rank 3 with this bot
 Marchete: I'm timeouting a lot
 MSmits: yeah but why specifically against me
 Marchete: I think it's from graphs
 MSmits: if you time out this much in general
 Marchete: timeout?
 Marchete: no no
 MSmits: you would not be rank 3
 Marchete: it's with everybody
 MSmits: but more with me
 Marchete: it must be the structures
 Marchete: that overlaps and pointers got wrong
 Marchete: i have structs with unions
 MSmits: so you do nothing with nim right?
 MSmits: you basically bet everything on score solving
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: which is a good bet btw, if you can force maps like this
 Marchete: I try to force
 MSmits: I migth need to let go of nim, or at least get rid of the sacrifice moves
 Astrobytes: add nimsolver = #1
 MSmits: not vs a bot like marchetes
 Astrobytes: I meant Marchete
 MSmits: if he improves it, he may wreck mikla
 Marchete: I think nim is useful
 MSmits: yeah but sacrificing costs you the game if you only rely on nim and your opponent forces loopy boards
 Marchete: it depends when
 MSmits: and nim requires sacrifice often
 Astrobytes: Not rely on nim, a two-pronged approach
 Astrobytes: *only on nim
 MSmits: what you can do is detect whether nim is a good approach
 MSmits: for example, if there are already a few long chains
 Astrobytes: Yes, otherwise fall back 
 MSmits: did i mention my bot is already 3.6k lines
 Astrobytes: Yes
 Marchete: but it seems to me that we are always ending with 23-26, you winning
 Marchete: you always do base?
 MSmits: thats because when you are in control you still do have an advantage when solving
 Marchete: down line?
 Marchete: at start
 MSmits: what do you mean base
 Marchete: bottom 1
 MSmits: oh that
 MSmits: mikla is the reason for that
 MSmits: it's like this
 Marchete:&#160;??
 MSmits: when i cant nimsolve
 MSmits: i dont want to simplify the board for him
 MSmits: so i take the least splitting move
 MSmits: so as not to divide and conquer for him
 MSmits: and that happens to end up being on an edge, usually the bottom
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: then he probably wont solve either
 MSmits: and if he plays a splitting move, i might be able to solve instead
 MSmits: thats the idea anyway, doesnt often work
 MSmits: but who cares, random line, or bottom
 MSmits: i guess i can be counterbooked now&#160;:)
 Marchete: I don't think so
 MSmits: though, the mcts still has random
 Marchete: I just do randoms
 MSmits: so it's doubtful
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: i was wrong, no this is my mcts doing this
 MSmits: i think it thinks chains will be longer with a long line at the bottom
 MSmits: or something
 MSmits: what a weird bot
 MSmits: your bot isnt having it though, it just builds loops out of it&#160;:)
 Marchete: I try to do loops :D
 MSmits: mine isnt exactly doing loops. It just tries to minimize the controlled value. I actually eval using floodfills and a graph
 MSmits: well when i do the loopy version
 MSmits: it's part of my score solver
 MSmits: i just copied it into my mcts eval
 Marchete: but you too are too high in scores...
 MSmits: what do you mean
 Marchete: +8pts
 MSmits: the rating?
 MSmits: or in a game?
 Marchete: leaderboards
 MSmits: ahh, well i win on nim vs almost everyone 
 MSmits: and when nim doesnt work, the score solver is pretty good
 MSmits: just a little sad mikla out-nims me somehow
 MSmits: so we all need to make this a score solver meta&#160;:)
 Marchete: this game is like playing mind games vs the enemy :D
 MSmits: yeah, I like it because you can kinda recognize the strategy if you watch a lot of games
 MSmits: thats not true for every board game here
 reCurse: Less a game and more a math problem IMO
 MSmits: reCurse true, when the meta is nim solving
 MSmits: but with score solving, it becomes partially, good old negamax
 MSmits: (still need some math)
 jacek: nice jump in rank struct
 struct: thanks, but I think I was a bit lucky
 struct: still NNs feel unbeatable with a normal bot
 MSmits: mostly they are yeah
 MSmits: you can still have some pride when being the best non-NN bot
 MSmits: who is this in BT?
 struct: who?
 struct: pamplemus?
 MSmits: possibly
 MSmits: it could also just be you
 struct: ah yes its him
 JudgeAL: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7159dfaa5250f2e4cac253d0aeee2407519d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7159dfaa5250f2e4cac253d0aeee2407519d</a>
 jacek: only you can stop the fire
 struct: I didnt get your question at first :p
 MSmits: ahh ok
 JudgeAL: one more approval plz
 JudgeAL: only if u think its good ofc
 Astrobytes: Patience is a virtue;
 NinjaDoggy: wait why does pamplemus's strat look so simple ._.
 struct: because it is
 NinjaDoggy: just push everyone together until you solve for a win
 MSmits: lol
 struct: I feel like it is that 
 MSmits: yeah that looks really simple
 MSmits: I could copy that
 NinjaDoggy: and it's beating every non-NN bot ._.
 MSmits: kinda shows you how hard it is to write a good eval for this game
 MSmits: if a simple heuristic start can beat everyone elses
 JudgeAL: which game are we talkin about here?
 NinjaDoggy: breakthrough
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/breakthrough/leaderboard</a>
 JudgeAL: :thumbsup:
 MSmits: though, it is of course completely possible this weird march in formation comes from a search and his eval just makes that happen
 MSmits: might not be hardcoded
 JudgeAL: hmmm, is this game solved?
 struct: I think he prunes the moves to do thi
 MSmits: not this size
 struct: this*
 NinjaDoggy: not solved but if you watch recurse replays it might look like it is&#160;;)
 MSmits: 6x6 might be solved though
 MSmits: not sure where the limit is
 JudgeAL: ahh I see
 MSmits: we also have a connect-4 that isnt solved
 MSmits: up to 8x8 is solved, but we have 9x7
 struct: we also have yavalath which is solved
 MSmits: i solved it for non-pie rule :P
 JudgeAL: dang
 NinjaDoggy: oh connect four is larger&#160;:/
 JudgeAL: alright imma try to solve breakthrough
 sprkrd: MSmits connect-4 is also solved for (2n)x7, I believe
 NinjaDoggy: i was wondering why people weren't trying to play center LOL
 struct: NinjaDoggy still fits in 64 bits
 MSmits: sprkrd you mean by mathematical proof?
 reCurse: Ugly multiplications though
 sprkrd: yes, mathematical proof
 MSmits: oh thats cool, I did not know that
 sprkrd: maybe I got the dimensions wrong, but there was some general case (2n)x7, 7x(2n) or something like that that was solved in general
 JudgeAL: I feel like breakthrough should be solvable
 MSmits: NinjaDoggy the reason they dont play center is mostly because of pie rule
 NinjaDoggy: sorry pie rule?
 jacek: or streal rule
 NinjaDoggy: oh :O
 MSmits: player 2 gets to steal player 1's move
 jacek: s/r//
 MSmits: so they play a balanced move, hopefully solved as draw
 MSmits: which is second from the left or right
 NinjaDoggy: ahhh makes sense, thanks
 MSmits: best move without pie rule is not center btw
 MSmits: it's left or right of center
 JudgeAL: oh what...
 NinjaDoggy: that's a really nice way to balance the game&#160;:)
 JudgeAL: lol never thought Id be listening to connect4 opening theory
 MSmits: it's the easiest way, assuming a balanced start exists
 reCurse: It's lazy game design :P
 jacek: we have also memes for connect 4
 MSmits: well the demands put on a game to make it balanced without rules like this are quite hard
 MSmits: for bot play anyways
 MSmits: humans dont really care unless they play professionally high level
 NinjaDoggy: it also preserves the original connect 4 gameplay 
 MSmits: pie rule is actually used in c4 afaik
 reCurse: Or swap sides~
 reCurse: This tilde sucks
 MSmits: what do you mean swap sides
 NinjaDoggy: good ole play as first, then play as second i assume
 MSmits: but isnt that the same as pie rule?
 reCurse: Nope
 MSmits: mmh i am trying to grasp the difference
 NinjaDoggy: no because you would play for win without account for steal
 reCurse: 2 games instead of 1
 NinjaDoggy: when going first
 MSmits: ohh that kind of swap
 MSmits: yeah but that is a worse solution for unbalanced games
 jacek: but that would lead to draws
 MSmits: exactly
 NinjaDoggy: technically they both lead to draws right?
 MSmits: with a small imbalance it's ok
 NinjaDoggy: difference is the draw states might be more complex with pie rule
 MSmits: not really NinjaDoggy, pie rule balances a single game
 sprkrd: i prefer the kung fu chess way of balancing games
 sprkrd: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kfchess.com/">https://www.kfchess.com/</a>
 MSmits: swapping gives you two foregone conclusions that add up to a draw
 MSmits: if the imbalance is big enough
 NinjaDoggy: yea but fundamentally there's no difference
 NinjaDoggy: it just depends on the amount of imbalance
 MSmits: I think there's a fundamental difference
 reCurse: There is a fundamental difference if there is no starting move with 50% winrate
 reCurse: You just hope there's one
 NinjaDoggy: ok true
 MSmits: ok say you have a bot that is a little better and would win 55% on a balanced game
 MSmits: now let it play an imbalanced game
 MSmits: he always loses when he is not p1
 JudgeAL: alright preliminary hypothesis on my journey to solve breakthrough
 NinjaDoggy: technically same arguement can be made:in the imbalanced game, the better bot might get a draw when not p1
 MSmits: so on swap he'd have 50%
 MSmits: instead of 55%
 JudgeAL: black has a forced win
 NinjaDoggy: but if we assume the balanced version has a forced draw it's technically the same thing
 MSmits: my point is, the game being balanced does not mean that two equally strong players always draw
 NinjaDoggy: just more complexity
 JudgeAL: does black usually win in breakthrough currently with the bots?
 MSmits: but with an imbalanced game two equally strong players *will* always draw
 NinjaDoggy: doesn't it still just depend on the complexity of the game?
 MSmits: if your bot is stronger, you need to be strong enough to overcome the disadvantage 
 MSmits: if you're only a little stronger, with swap, the advantage completely disappears
 MSmits: with pie rule it does not
 MSmits: yeah complexity enters into it somewhat
 reCurse: Pie rule assumes there's a 50% winrate starting move
 reCurse: Which I would argue is more often wrong
 MSmits: a balanced one yes
 MSmits: but even if not
 MSmits: it's better than not having it at all
 NinjaDoggy: ok so just pie rule + swap&#160;:)
 reCurse: It's better to swap
 MSmits: the rule can only make things better, not worse
 NinjaDoggy: pie rule to make the game more balanced, swap anyways to compensate for the small imbalance
 MSmits: in uttt, pie rule would have been better than swap
 reCurse: Pie rule is insanely annoying to deal with
 reCurse: No I disagree
 MSmits: allright, best example of all: Yavalath
 MSmits: I solved it for center move
 MSmits: if you dont have pie rule, with swap it would be 100% draw
 reCurse: Forced start with swap is better than pie with swap
 MSmits: agreed
 MSmits: a forced start is basically a forced pie rule
 reCurse: My point is you should have solutions at least equally easy to implement better than pie rule
 MSmits: instead of letting players choose a balanced move, you let the rules pick the balanced move
 MSmits: so forced start is similar
 reCurse: The difference is you don't have to write a different heuristic to decide if the start is balanced or not
 reCurse: Which I find insanely obnoxious
 MSmits: ahh but pie rule has 1 major advantage, it's a very safe thing to put into your game.
 MSmits: if you're going to force a balanced start, you need to know what it is
 MSmits: with pie rule, the meta will figure it out
 MSmits: for you
 reCurse: With swap the force doesn't need to be balanced just close enough
 MSmits: lazy game design sure
 reCurse: You introduced a second game
 reCurse: With pie rule
 reCurse: Therefore it sucks :P
 MSmits: 2 games are not better than 1&#160;?
 reCurse: Everyone loves wood league so I guess so
 MSmits: you're right that our C4 would have been better with forces move 1 start
 reCurse: Imagine chess960 with pie rule at start
 reCurse: Not only I have to write a chess bot
 reCurse: I also need to write a great first move eval
 reCurse: ugh
 MSmits: but yavalath is actually interesting for having various starts that work as balanced moves
 MSmits: 5 out of 9
 MSmits: i guess randoming them would have been cool too
 MSmits: but then again you'd have to know at design time which ones they are
 reCurse: You can progressively make forced random starts better when they're proven to be imbalanced
 reCurse: It's seamless
 reCurse: Bot makers don't have to worry about your crappy game design :P
 MSmits: you mean just change the forced starts?
 reCurse: Sure
 reCurse: You can start with pure randoms
 reCurse: You monitor games
 MSmits: I guess if you warn botmakers that the start can be changed
 reCurse: Weed out the imbalanced ones
 reCurse: But it's always random start
 reCurse: They have to assume it changes
 MSmits: ohh ok
 reCurse: So no break
 MSmits: yes
 NinjaDoggy: just use UCB1 or something&#160;;)
 MSmits: thats a nice solution reCurse
 reCurse: Now we're talking NinjaDoggy
 MSmits: I like it
 MSmits: uttt would be so much better with this
 reCurse: Yes
 reCurse: Assuming you mean so much as a multiplicative ratio
 reCurse: Then times zero works
 MSmits: haha
 MSmits: that uttt-hate :grin:
 MSmits: seems like we end up agreeing at the end this time
 MSmits: feels weird
 MSmits: say something I dont agree with
 NinjaDoggy: wait this idea is actually really cool because it extends beyond just the first move :O
 MSmits: ye
 MSmits: well its used in games
 MSmits: i think gomoku uses it, and go I think&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: no way Go uses it...
 reCurse: Well there are some times I'm not completely wrong
 MSmits: indeed
 NinjaDoggy: isn't Go just balanced by komi?
 MSmits: not sure, there's a ton of ways to play go
 MSmits: apparently
 MSmits: yeah i dont find it for go
 MSmits: "ournament Gomoku has adopted the swap2 opening protocol starting in 2009. In Swap2, the first player starts by placing three stones, 2 black and 1 white, on the board. The second player then selects one of three options: play as black, play as white and place another white stone, or place two more stones, one white and one black, and let the first player choose the color" 
 MSmits: sounds a bit like pie rule too
 MSmits: very complicated
 MSmits: seems like all these x-in-a-row games have balance issues that need solutions like this
 reCurse: I wish I was smart enough to understand go
 JudgeAL: I think everyone can understand it, but hard to get good at
 NinjaDoggy: it's not about being smart it's about building intuition from a young age&#160;;)
 reCurse: Well I mean I understand the rules
 reCurse: I just don't "get" it
 NinjaDoggy: tune your brain NN early :P
 JudgeAL: lol get dem pattern recognition
 JudgeAL: okay, breakthrough is harder to solve than I initially thought but still doable
 Drichie: Quick question. I am doing the Chuck Norris Unary puzzle. My code works fine until I'm given a&#160;% symbol. My Code reads it in as 100101, but the puzzle wants it read in  as 0100101. What am I doing wrong when it comes to symbols?
 struct: padding 0
 NinjaDoggy: @judgeAI you really think it's solvable for 8x8?
 JudgeAL: yeah
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html">https://tromp.github.io/c4/c4.html</a>
 struct: solved for p2
 Drichie: geez didn't even notice that, thank you!
 jacek: breakthrough isnt solved for 6x6. 8x8 is orders of magnitudes bigger
 struct: i think its only solved up to 5x5
 JudgeAL: do you know if 6x4 is solved?
 reCurse: No one made the breakthrough yet
 JudgeAL: lol
 NinjaDoggy: :joy:
 JudgeAL: or like anyone have a link to solved versions?
 NinjaDoggy: ok 6 by 6 seems relatively reasonable I suppose? since 36 choose 12 is like 1.25 billion
 sprkrd: seems so
 sprkrd: but the bound is more complicated than that
 sprkrd: you have to consider also that some pawns may be missing
 sprkrd: so it's not just arranging 12 pawns over 36 cells
 NinjaDoggy: yea and that's only your pawns
 NinjaDoggy: not counting opp pawns yet :P
 JudgeAL: so for 6X2 black has forced win
 JudgeAL: Im trying to build up from there
 NinjaDoggy: but if you factor in invalid states, and pruning that can be done because it's 2 player game it seems possible to solve 6 by 6 with a regular machine
 NinjaDoggy: oh are you trying to solve it mathematically as opposed to brute forcing?
 JudgeAL: yeah
 sprkrd: he's doing it right
 struct: This article shows 6x6
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://scholarworks.csun.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.3/174085/Isaac-Andrew-thesis-2016.pdf">https://scholarworks.csun.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.3/174085/Isaac-Andrew-thesis-2016.pdf</a>
 struct: with tablebase
 struct: But is not solved
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)#Game_Solving">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)#Game_Solving</a> 6x5 5x5 3x7 solved
 sprkrd: maths for the win
 struct: They used 5th row tablebase for 6x6
 JudgeAL: oh
 NinjaDoggy: anyone use endgame table in breakthrough?
 struct: i dont
 struct: but I check for wins from 3rd row
 jacek: just some ifology 
 struct: with a few shifts
 JudgeAL: oh dang looks like second player winning for 8x8 is likely
 NinjaDoggy: in general terms what does a mathematically solution even mean?
 NinjaDoggy: like if a game is proven to be a draw
 NinjaDoggy: but they can't extract the sequence of moves, how does that work?
 sprkrd: depends on the proof
 sprkrd: the proof for tic tac toe is constructive, you can extract the sequence of moves, for instance
 MSmits: some proofs of this kind are super straightforward
 sprkrd: but some proofs are not constructive
 JudgeAL: yeah could be "fully/strongly solved" or like just solved in the sense you know the outcome of a perfect game
 MSmits: I can tell you that our D&amp;B game is not solved as a draw
 MSmits: i can mathematically prove this
 NinjaDoggy: :O
 JudgeAL: wats D&amp;B\
 MSmits: 49 boxes to capture, can't tie :P
 JudgeAL: oh
 NinjaDoggy: :joy:
 JudgeAL: dots and boxes?
 MSmits: yeah
 NinjaDoggy: good proof MSmits, thanks&#160;:)
 MSmits: i think they solved checkers by a combination of opening databases, endgame databases, mathematical proof and brute search
 NinjaDoggy: I like how you separate endgame databases from brute search :P
 MSmits: well I guess... another brute search&#160;:)
 struct: weakly solved
 MSmits: weakly solved is what we mean by solved
 JudgeAL: so what Im hearing is brute search *3 + some math
 struct: I think this is the reason why checkers tournaments start from certain positions
 MSmits: might be yes
 MSmits: positions that would not be reached by a solver
 NinjaDoggy: i think not reached is not quite right
 NinjaDoggy: but not fully solved by the solver
 MSmits: not reached in the sense that an ab pruned minimax doesnt need to visit all branches
 NinjaDoggy: that's more like reached, but not solved right?
 NinjaDoggy: i guess it's a small semantics thing
 MSmits: yes semantics i think
 MSmits: btw, brute search kinda sounds like it's simple
 MSmits: but what they did for checkers wasnt simple at all, it's some genius stuff in there from the little i read of it
 MSmits: endgame databases are a whole corner of study alone
 MSmits: especially the indexing to make them as compact as possible to fit in RAM and such
 MSmits: computer limitations makes people inventive. Today's computer power makes people lazy
 NinjaDoggy: true&#160;:)
 MSmits: i did a little indexing stuff for oware. Gave me some headaches to do this
 jacek: and then you can owned by 10 copycats
 MSmits: assigning a number of a certain distribution of seeds over 12 pits
 MSmits: haha yes that too
 MSmits: I remember trying to overfit to robo and re curse, back when they were the only nns
 MSmits: could not imagine then that the top 10 would be all NN
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Anyone here who's familiar with python willing to help me debug some code?&#160;:)
 TobiasA: me pick me
 TobiasA: :raised_hand:
 ANONYMOUS42: wow someone is really eager to help
 ANONYMOUS42: good for you
 TobiasA: people with maliciously cryptic usernames are not to be trusted though
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Oki ty
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: &gt;,&gt;
 AstroHydes: don't worry about MCU, relatively trustworthy I believe
 Astrobytes: Hm, wrong window
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: xD
 struct: need to find next game where I can reuse my mcts with little to no effort :p
 jacek: amazons?
 struct: to many moves for me
 Astrobytes: lazy git :D
 MSmits: it's *your* game!
 MSmits: and when are you making a yavalath both while we're at it
 MSmits: bot
 TobiasA: ppl who name themselves anonymous make their unidentifiability their identity which make them a living paradox
 TobiasA: :imp:
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: o.o
 jacek: o, i can follow him
 MSmits: well I just think he is a fan of MCU movies and is afraid to come out and say it
 MSmits: afraid of nerd judgement
 NinjaDoggy: but... isn't MCU movies pretty mainstream now?
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: O.O
 jacek: i think he meant author of yavalath
 MSmits: we're not mainstream here&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: There's another MCU
 MSmits: oh no, don't start on the x-men movies again Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: No, in chat
 MSmits: o
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: lol
 MSmits: thanks Marchete
 MSmits: gj
 Marchete: :thumbsup:
 jacek: hm?
 Marchete: even a broken bot is useful
 MSmits: he pushed me to nr 1:P
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Wow I completely reset my old code, wrote a rudimentary bot, and it's in the exact same rank as my old one after submitting
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Not sure what that says about my old one
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: =,=
 MSmits: depends on your rank
 MSmits: could be they're both awesome
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: 643 out of 6677... gold csb
 NinjaDoggy: rudimentary bot with awesome rank :thinking:
 MSmits: like that plamop... something guy
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: It's just... simulation 5 turns ahead... that's all...
 MSmits: in BT
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: rip gtg
 NinjaDoggy: hahaha true :P
 MSmits: MaliciouslyCrypticUsername that rank is probably better than -3vel though
 NinjaDoggy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2f99d0b1-ff66-411b-a4c4-9f8ee4bae9f2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2f99d0b1-ff66-411b-a4c4-9f8ee4bae9f2</a>
 MSmits: yeah thats what he does
 MSmits: you cracked it&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: *broke through
 struct: sim is quite simple too
 MSmits: how do you know
 struct: Because I did it pretty fast
 MSmits: ohh i thought you meant the other guys sim
 MSmits: sure yes, its quite simple
 Astrobytes: I think it's the general case. It's not hard to sim
 NinjaDoggy: can anyone help me with some pruning ideas in sokoban?
 NinjaDoggy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/sokoban">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/sokoban</a>
 NinjaDoggy: I already solved the puzzle with basic bitboarding + BFS, but now i'm trying to think of clever pruning ideas :D
 Astrobytes: don't push boxes in corners, hash states
 Astrobytes: all I know :P
 MSmits: hmm isnt there some way to also prune boxes on edges when there's no way to get them off the edge/
 NinjaDoggy: yea I already got the hashing part
 NinjaDoggy: and I have some ideas about precomputing:
 NinjaDoggy: so given the position of the pusher and the position of a box
 TobiasA: the only technique i know that has the word pruning in it is "alpha beta pruning"
 NinjaDoggy: assume there's only that box, compute if you can push the box to a target location
 NinjaDoggy: and this is precomputable in N^2(N = number of empty tiles)
 MSmits: I never opened that puzzle before. another awesome piece of work by eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 TobiasA: prooning
 NinjaDoggy: but can't think of anything else&#160;:(
 MSmits: seems like a good thing to do 
 NinjaDoggy: yea it's pretty neat since computing it only takes N^2 and using it to prune is just 1 operation in the bitboard
 NinjaDoggy: but it's still pretty basic since it doesn't deal with multiple boxes at all&#160;:/
 MSmits: well i dont think more than 1 box is doable
 MSmits: if there is a second box you're not just dealing with it as an obstacle
 MSmits: it also still needs to go to its own destination
 NinjaDoggy: oh I guess if i wanted, I could just extend it to add more boxes
 NinjaDoggy: like precompute all arrangements of 2 boxes
 NinjaDoggy: and see if both boxes can be pushed to a target
 MSmits: yeah, that would give you a huge table though
 NinjaDoggy: N = number of empty tiles
 NinjaDoggy: storage needed would be N^(boxes+1) / 64 :P
 sprkrd: you just wanted to do a shameless plug of your awesome pruning idea, didn't you :smirk:
 MSmits: thats ok
 NinjaDoggy: he found me out :P
 sprkrd: I think yours is the best pruning idea I've heard until now
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: me too
 sprkrd: (the thing with just 1 box)
 Astrobytes: did you test it yet?
 NinjaDoggy: implementing it now
 MSmits: euler needs to make a sokoban2 puzzle that needs the pruning
 NinjaDoggy: was also hoping to find some golden egg someone else came up with&#160;;)
 sprkrd: I would go with that, with just 1 bot
 sprkrd: that deals with corners, edges, and even other trickier positions
 NinjaDoggy: yea I'll start with the 1 box and see how much it prunes
 sprkrd: box*
 NinjaDoggy: too used to typing bot :joy: relatable
 sprkrd: yeah :joy:
 Astrobytes: I end sentences with&#160;;
 NinjaDoggy: LOL :joy:
 MSmits: Astrobytes switch to python and people won't notice your complete detachment from the non-coding world
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 sprkrd: i'd rather see how he'd speak if he switched to Lisp
 Astrobytes: ()
 MSmits: with a lisp, obviously
 sprkrd: (with a lisp (obviously))
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: I got a request for help last night
 MSmits: from someone in China
 sprkrd: you have to take a plane?
 Astrobytes: on CG or real life?
 MSmits: but was about to sleep so couldnt help. But I think he/she was communicating through google translate
 MSmits: CG
 MSmits: was a nice person, but it's hard to understand through translation
 MSmits: getting a general simple idea across works, kinda, but complex coding problems...
 AstroHydes: How do you know they were nice then?
 Astrobytes: argh 
 MSmits: argh what animal is that
 MSmits: he/she was just super polite
 Astrobytes: I was just expressing frustration at typing from my alt again, I have disabled chat on it now
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: i do it too
 MSmits: we suck at smurfing
 Astrobytes: I know eh
 KiwiTae: I am worse I forgot my alt logs
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: this is fun if it happens right after you submitted your best bot on it
 MSmits: it'd be up there and you cant beat it
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 MSmits: eh, mr CG dev, I want to report an alt account
 Marchete: hmm soryy smits
 Marchete: sorry*
 MSmits: oww
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 MSmits: ah well
 Marchete: your 100% vs everyone else is no more
 MSmits: always the same way too, i sacrifice a box and then you win on score
 Marchete: the thing is that I removed the RNG
 Marchete: in that submit
 Marchete: to see if I can track the bug
 MSmits: oh 
 Marchete: so I play "heuristic"
 MSmits: this is a timeout bug we're talking about right?
 Marchete: anyways 57% vs mikla 30% vs you
 Marchete: no problem, you are 1st again
 MSmits: ah coolio
 Marchete: "timeout" as overflow
 Marchete: I think I go out of bounds
 MSmits: of an array?
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: but as I said
 MSmits: ah, should be easy to check
 MSmits: cerr everywhere
 Marchete: an array with multiples uses
 Astrobytes: assert() 
 Marchete: like it can hold a graph with 5 subgraphs
 MSmits: fine, do it the "professional" way, with assert :P
 Marchete: or a graph with N+ subgraphs
 Marchete: cerr &lt;&lt; "A"&lt;&lt;endl;
 Marchete: cerr &lt;&lt; "B"&lt;&lt;endl;
 Marchete: etc :D
 MSmits: yeah!
 MSmits: i tend to do cerr &lt;&lt; "woops" &lt;&lt; endl;  
 MSmits: cerr &lt;&lt; "wtf how?" &lt;&lt; endl;
 Astrobytes: I have lots of those as well as asserts
 Marchete: well, I'll see that another day
 Marchete: 3rd with bugs is fine
 Marchete: cya!
 MSmits: very true
 MSmits: gj and gn
 Astrobytes: cerr &lt;&lt; "f***"/"why"/"test"/"this is wrong" etc
 MSmits: thats what  i do yea
 Astrobytes: later Marchete
 MSmits: I've been listening to music while coding for days since we last talked about it
 MSmits: same YT track
 Astrobytes: and of course "wetrertewrtwert"
 MSmits: i shared it here to say what sort of music i listen to and now i cant stop listening to it
 Astrobytes: remind me again
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwuQ6UHMQg&amp;t=3660s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiwuQ6UHMQg&amp;t=3660s</a>
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah I remember
 MSmits: he's really really good
 Astrobytes: If I want some chill stuff I often listen to Yann Tiersen
 MSmits: oh i see
 MSmits: this is not just chill stuff though, it's all celtic but there's different levels of energy
 MSmits: I'll check this guy out too
 Astrobytes: Speaking as a Celt, it's not so much Celtic but Celtic-inspired
 MSmits: ahh ok, speaking as a non-celt nor expert, I just think it's very beautiful music :0
 Astrobytes: Some of it isn't too bad
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK-j2XVl_mc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK-j2XVl_mc</a> this is the one i like best, if you just want 1 track
 Astrobytes: (from a Scots person that means it's alright)
 MSmits: yeah, I'm just weird that i never bother to listen to music, so this is kinda new to me
 MSmits: i dont like much at all
 Astrobytes: Not bad. Euphoric moments.
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: it's just 1 guy behind a computer and I think he plays 1 instrument
 Astrobytes: It's almost getting towards My Heart Will Go On material though
 MSmits: keyboard +guitar
 MSmits: ahh yes
 MSmits: titanic 
 Astrobytes: Yes I imagine many a sample pack was used in the creation of this music
 MSmits: not sure what his workflow is, but he makes his money doing this
 Astrobytes: Good on him The world needs music.
 MSmits: yeah. I also like all the comments under his videos. I am used to watching YT about US politics and such
 MSmits: so positive, these
 Astrobytes: I try not to read most of the comments on YT unless I am familiar with the channel
 MSmits: sometimes i cant resist a quick look, but pretty toxic
 MSmits: "My hair starts to braid itself while listening to this."
 Astrobytes: The Jerry Garcia channel I'm regular on is just full of stoned hippies. It's friendlier than a friendly thing at a friendliness convention.
 MSmits: haha i can imagine
 Astrobytes: Great music though, and genuinely nice people.
 Illedan: Hi
 Astrobytes: :wave:
 MSmits: hi Illedan
 Illedan: Renovation takes so much time :expressionless:
 MSmits: depends on what you're renovating but sure
 Astrobytes: What you doing?
 Illedan: Kids room
 Astrobytes: Ah
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: Preparing for the next stage
 MSmits: we're back to reproduction again
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: So, now I got 30 min to try and fix some snake shit
 Illedan: Lets go!
 Illedan: Did anyone manage to get some intellisense env with this CG JS?
 struct: only for pixi
 struct: But it wasnt great
 Illedan: -.-
 struct: I used intellij I think
 struct: ultimate
 Illedan: Same, but JS is crap
 Illedan: ah
 Illedan: I use CE
 Illedan: Ok, stealing everything from Euler and hope it will work in the end&#160;:)
 Illedan: yoloCoder3000
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: no need to hurry Illedan snakes shit only once every 3 days at most
 Astrobytes: *at least
 Astrobytes: oh wait, yeah
 MSmits: apparently they can take months between shits
 MSmits: poor diet imho
 Astrobytes: yeah, depends what they eat
 Astrobytes: Once they finish digesting their meal they shit
 Illedan: hmm
 MSmits: thats how shit works
 Illedan: I guess I can add that to the logic
 Astrobytes: But it takes a long time for sneks
 MSmits: yeah
 Illedan: 3 days are outside CG timelimit though
 MSmits: true
 Astrobytes: And they only do 1 big jobby
 MSmits: better give them diarrhea
 Astrobytes: We might go for a few
 Astrobytes: snek will make a not smol jobby after every meal
 Astrobytes: Imagine an anaconda shite after eating something big...
 Astrobytes: Could take a month but you don't wanna be there
 MSmits: I'm sure it would be worse if you were the one getting eaten
 Astrobytes: Very possibly
 MSmits: but yeah i would not want to watch you get pooped out either
 MSmits: btw Illedan dont mind us, but do save this chat for the backstory
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Illedan: xd
 3141948: &gt; Imagine an anaconda shite after eating something big...😂
 Astrobytes: lol, sorry :D
 Illedan: If I wasn't lazy I would make Nokia 3310 theme on this snake :P
 MSmits: like euler did for minesweeper?
 Astrobytes: haha you know :D
 Illedan: ye
 Illedan: But I'm not euler
 Illedan: and I don't have time for this :P
 Illedan: Wanted a quick and dirty new Optim
 Illedan: yeyeye
 Illedan: Astro will get a box of used diapers for putting me up for this
 MSmits: priorities, right, a theme for kids room or a theme for snake
 MSmits: easy choice imho
 Illedan: Snake theme kids room!
 MSmits: works
 MSmits: also something to talk about with his/her therapist in 20 years
 Astrobytes: Aw thanks man!&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Snek theme for kids room would be awesome
 MSmits: I like it when things go against the norm
 Astrobytes: I always wanted to paint my room black so I could paint stars and nebulae on it
 Astrobytes: Wasn't allowed&#160;:(
 Illedan: If my kid want a pink unicorn room in a few years, I'll do it. But if I teach her right, it will be a giant NN on the wall :D 
 Astrobytes: hahaha, ML kindergarten is real
 KiwiTae: when u find a big booboo in your code that must have been in there for 3 4 months.. shame on me lol
 Astrobytes: sounds normal&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: It was making my bot refusing to converge towards a static target~ 
 Astrobytes: what game?
 KiwiTae: so annoying~ 2letters for a naughty behavior heh
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes real life robot hehe
 Astrobytes: Aha! Much more fun :D
 Astrobytes: Casual or for work?
 KiwiTae: both :sunglasses: :joy:
 Astrobytes: Excellent answer&#160;:)
 KiwiTae: casual work u do on a sunday evenin lmao
 Astrobytes: Serious though, there are loads of kits out there to play around with
 Astrobytes: I mean you could actually create a nail polish drying robot! :P
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes would be sooo useful :joy:
 Illedan: Alright off to bed. 200 lines of untested JS code done. Hope it works when I have time to finish it&#160;:)
 Illedan: bye
 IlyasDirham: follow for a follow
 KiwiTae: see yaaa
 TobiasA: buhbye
 Astrobytes: later Illedan
 Astrobytes: lol KiwiTae
 GumChew: test
 Astrobytes: segmentation fault
 HeroicRobot_cf06: WHY MY CODE NOT WORK:if(1+1===3)
 tunisian: hello 
 Astrobytes: Because you are trolling HeroicRobot_cf06
 SaifAli153: if((1+1)===3)check
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: LOL
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: any idea what that means lol
 MaliciouslyCrypticUsername: nope i don't either :shrug:
 FalINTOblivion0112: seems sus
 phKvothe: Anyone else have it where after a couple runs, the pods quit doing the animation on screen?  I still get the printouts below, but would like to see the pods in action to determine the changes i need to make
 TobiasA: :raised_hand:
 Wontonimo: hiya TobiasA
 TobiasA: ooooiiiiiii
 TobiasA: long time
 Wontonimo: yeah.  how's things?
 Wontonimo: what browser are you using phKvothe&#160;?
 phKvothe: I'm running in Chrome.  Just have to refresh the screen from time to time.  It seems to keep the code, so thats all good
 Wontonimo: sometimes i use the share button to make the playback open in another tab.  it always plays perfectly in the other tab.  kinda kludgy way around it, but it works
 TobiasA: it's been good
 phKvothe: thank you, will try that!
 Wontonimo: a benefit to keeping a few old playbacks in other tabs is that you can now reference back to them to see behaviour change difference with your new code
 Wontonimo: have you been working on an challenge or multi TobiasA&#160;?
 TobiasA: i've done some puzzles 
 TobiasA: i'm trying to fix something in csb too
 phKvothe: How do I tell if I'm faster?  Is it the number of steps to win?  I thought it might be time, but don't see that changing, however, my steps did go from 199 to 188, so that seems like it might be it.  But first time doing this, so just wanted to verify.
 Wontonimo: what are you playing phKvothe&#160;?
 phKvothe: Coders Strike Back
 phKvothe: it was the listed top one for training, so just went with it
 phKvothe: Once I click "Test in Arena", do I do anything else?  It looks like it just kicks off and plays against others automatically.  Is that correct?
 Wontonimo: yeah, just sit back and watch battle tv
 Wontonimo: or work on you next improvement, of go make a sandwich 
 iBug: Security Check 
 Wontonimo: 4520 4743 5543 8821 pin 445
 Wontonimo: does it check out iBug&#160;?
 Wontonimo: (I guess iBug is now going on a shopping spree)
 iBug: My English is bad
 Wontonimo: me too iBug.  me too
 iBug: are you from?
 Wontonimo: Canada
 FalINTOblivion0112: guys im working on a contribution
 FalINTOblivion0112: should i make the coc ez or hard
 iBug: oh I am Chinese
 FalINTOblivion0112: wut
 Wontonimo: iBug was talking to me
 FalINTOblivion0112: oh actually I am chinese too
 FalINTOblivion0112: no cap
 iBug: How to learn Engish
 Wontonimo: i'm assuming it's like anything else.  practice.  A friend of mine learns new languages by trying to take all his notes in the new language
 FalINTOblivion0112: I struggled when I was first trying to learn english
 Wontonimo: me too
 FalINTOblivion0112: But I studied and improved quickly by reading literature
 Wontonimo: i had 4 good tutors and still wasn't able to make full complete sentence until 5 years tutoring
 iBug: ok thk，iam going to work
 LibgdxKotlinChampion: question b0ss

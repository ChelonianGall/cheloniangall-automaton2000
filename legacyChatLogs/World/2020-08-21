 Bbaaii: test
 volkarion: .
 jacek: good morning
 Damian-crypto: hi guys!
 Daredevil1902: good afternoon
 Devenar: how do you print debugging stuff in Python?
 jrke: print("stuff",file=sys.stderr)
 Devenar: Thank you!
 jrke: you need import sys header for that
 AntiSquid: good night
 jrke: good night antisquid&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: (it's night somewhere in the world, not going to bed now)
 fajjet: how to remove shortest mode from clash of code?
 JBM: buy codingame
 fajjet: mehh
 fajjet: premium?
 GoogleJeff: no, they mean "buy the entire company"
 Tiramon: no he is talking about the company
 Tiramon: it's not possible
 fajjet: why?
 GoogleJeff: you can create your own Clash of Code problem and not include shortest mode for that specific problem that you created
 Tiramon: same reason as 'why not'
 Tiramon: oh you can exclude on privates?
 Tiramon: oh nice .. havn't seen that
 GoogleJeff: i'm pretty sure there are three checkboxes, one for fastest, one for shortest, and one for... um, reverse, or whatever
 Tiramon: yes even possible to limit languages
 Tiramon: that new ... atleast for me&#160;;)
 jrke: yeah private clashes but you have to get your own player and didn't affect your general clash rank.
 tutubalin: i like shortest mode
 jrke: hey tiramon will you udate your D&amp;B bot
 tutubalin: i don't like coding in a rush just to lose 1 second because of some typo
 Jacob03: i have mixed feelings about shortest mode. I feel like having whitespace count encourages bad practice
 tutubalin: i like slow smart coding, improving code without hustle, trying different languages to choose the best for the problem
 Jacob03: yes but fastest and reverse test your coding skills under pressure
 Jacob03: so I guess it depends on which you find more important
 tutubalin: which i find more entertaining
 tutubalin: Jacob03 on another coding site they ignore whitespace for char count. but that leads to some cheaty solution where most of logic is built with whitespaces
 Jacob03: oh right that makes sense
 Tiramon: jrke... yes i should add some search ...
 jrke: ok
 fedtj: :nose_5:
 Dark_Hack: F U C K You
 fedtj: :nose:
 A.Safarkhon: pashil von
 AntiSquid: ya no spam, no vulgarities, no littering the floor, thanks
 jacek: bloody hell
 darkhorse64: :skull_crossbones:
 darkhorse64: :hammer:
 fedtj: moderator kick Dark_Hack from codingame plz
 WhoIsLTD: ~~
 fajjet: nope guys, shortest mode is annoying and useless. That's only about syntax in most cases
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: you can't enjoy things i don't like
 Automaton2000: he doesn't have to be above the boss
 jacek: do you life frogs, AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem?
 Uljahn: AutomatonNN: frog lifes matter
 AutomatonNN: why did you want to compete with the wood bosses?
 tutubalin: fajjet there are a lot of tricks for codegolf
 tutubalin: and getting rid of whitespaces and renaming identifiers to 1 letter is the first step, but definitely not the last
 tutubalin: check my 100 bytes long bot for pacman that's able to exit wood league
 tutubalin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/52">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2020-feedback-strategy/184113/52</a>
 Tiramon: yay coc qustmap part is also done ..
 AntiSquid: mild insult: "AutomatonNN 11:25AMwhy did you want to compete with the wood bosses?"
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 AntiSquid: it somewhat implies they aren't good enough to compete with anyone other than the wood bosses AutomatonNN @_@
 AutomatonNN: what is the problem with the rules?
 Uljahn: it somewhat implies playing community multis :smirk:
 darkhorse64: Guys so bored that they talk to bots
 Tiramon: oh that's completly normal darkhorse64
 Saptarshi: Hey guys! how about starting an coding community in Discord?
 Illedan: Seen the big yellow link on top of this chat?
 Saptarshi: ya
 Saptarshi: but ours own would be much better!?
 Tiramon: so because the is an official one a private one should be created?i don't see any sense in that ...
 Tiramon: *there
 Saptarshi: sorry,stupid of meðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
 Schwase: if you want to make a separate coding discord more power to you, but going into global chat and advertising it as a community discord doesnt. There are places in the CG discord to advertise servers, you should definitely check it out, you arent getting the full CG experience without using the CG discord IMO
 jacek: discord vs celestia
 Tiramon:&#160;?Celestia is a 3D astronomy software program created by Chris Laurel. 
 Tiramon: guess you are not talking about that celestia ...
 jacek: well, try search for discord and celestia simultaously
 Tiramon: some strange comic figures ...
 jacek: perhaps thats your personalized search
 Zenoscave: nope same comics showed up for me
 jacek: maybe you both like the same things
 jrke: why this one person defeats me a lot though he is behind me 
 jrke: not few matches majority of matches
 Zenoscave: what game?
 jrke: D&amp;B
 jrke: hay the first defeats me a lot dunno why?
 Zenoscave: their strategy may just be effective against yours but not everyone else
 jrke: so could i hardcode strategies for him?
 Zenoscave: I would advise against that. that usually makes a weaker bot overall
 Zenoscave: but you could if you wanted
 jrke:  losing against him cost me lot of points
 Zenoscave: jrke your bot is pretty strong anyhow. What do you use? Minimax? or?
 jrke: minimax
 Zenoscave: cool
 Zenoscave: I'm still a basic deterministic algo.
 jrke: its my best minimax bot on codingame till now
 Zenoscave: gratz
 hachbani: Given two integers a and b, answer the sign of the product of a, a+1, ..., b.
 hachbani: anyonecan explain this for me please&#160;? 
 hachbani: I don't get what should be calculated 
 hachbani: a*(a+1)*b&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: a*(a+1)*(a+2)*(a+3)*...*(b-1)*b
 spyr03: p = 1for x in range(a, b + 1):
 hachbani: aaaaahhhh 
 hachbani: Now i get it 
 hachbani: thanks mate 
 AggYzz: **dasd**
 jrke: i got what was going wrong against that player in D&amp;B
 jacek: hm?
 Zenoscave: what was it jrke
 dbdr: jrke: I can push you up and trictrac down<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/dbdr">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-dots-and-boxes/dbdr</a>do you have any offer?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: :cat: :knife:
 eulerscheZahl: should be the other order
 dbdr:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: blackmailing
 dbdr: if anything it's whitemailing
 dbdr: or I could blackmail NOT to submit again :D
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i didn't think this through
 dbdr: or blackmail trictrac to submit
 dbdr: so many options
 dbdr: *spamsubmit
 eulerscheZahl: is that the CG version of threatening with DDos?
 dbdr: kind of, yeah
 dbdr: hm, I found a business model
 dbdr: 1. develop a strong bot that can identify opponent, or with RPS effect2. approach various players3. profit
 dbdr: you can even play realpolitik on several multis
 dbdr: if you spamsubmit on uTTT, I'll retaliate on Othello
 dbdr: cold wars, alliances, ...
 Hjax: i feel like the most equipped to do that is smits 
 Hjax: he can just make a book to ruin any individuals day
 dbdr: other people can make books too
 dbdr: The Book Wars
 dbdr: good chapter title
 MSmits: I've been counter booking Royale all day btw
 MSmits: every time i get near 100% he submits a new bot :P
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: where? othello?
 MSmits: yeah
 dbdr: I think he wants to get back the #1 rank globally
 MSmits: I do it on cg bench so he doesnt notice me doing it btw
 MSmits: I'll submit when it's 100% 
 MSmits: but that wont happen if he is changing his bot
 dbdr: good that you don't speak about it publicly&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes :P
 MSmits: I dont mind really
 dbdr: I know
 MSmits: the bot gets better from it
 MSmits: more branches countered
 MSmits: he's training my bot
 MSmits: the older version was already winning 70% or so
 MSmits: but he was losing more vs you guys so royale spam was brining me down
 MSmits: bringing
 dbdr: or rather, us up
 MSmits: yeah either way
 MSmits: oh he just submitted again 
 MSmits: I guess I'll go change that version number in my othello.yaml file :P
 MSmits: agent nr that is
 MSmits: btw not all games are equally bookable
 MSmits: UTTT is very hard, oware also
 MSmits: the only reason I was succeeding in UTTT is because I was trying it against other people with books
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr  08:03PMI think he wants to get back the #1 rank globally
 MSmits: in oware, I am currently trying to counter jacek, who is almost entirely deterministic 50 plies deep and I am still not winning much, because games last for 200 plies and even if I play perfectly for the first 50, I have 150 more to make a mistake
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, I though you didn't care?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't :D
 eulerscheZahl: just reacting to random lines i catch while partially reading the chat
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: partially&#160;!?
 <b>**MSmits is offended</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: you are writing walls of text
 eulerscheZahl: and it's late
 MSmits: beautiful walls
 dbdr: he doesn't have time to write less
 eulerscheZahl: in the evening i can't handle those anymore
 MSmits: right dbdr
 MSmits: mmh it's not that late is it
 MSmits: dont you have almost 2 hrs to go?
 dbdr: night is falling
 The_Auditor: is this thing worth the time&#160;?
 dbdr: it's not june anymore
 eulerscheZahl: yeah. i go to bed earlier in the winter
 MSmits: The_Auditor what thing?
 The_Auditor: codingame
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: you will not find anything more awesome
 dbdr: ^
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your level of nerdiness if you will like it
 dbdr: non-nerds don't even get here
 MSmits: yeah
 The_Auditor: LOL
 MSmits: if you got here, you're supposed to be here
 eulerscheZahl: except if forced by the teacher
 MSmits: right, there is that exception
 The_Auditor: alright, sold
 MSmits: The_Auditor are you able to program reasonably well in at least one programming language?
 MSmits: I mean, the basics, loops, conditions, lists/arrays etc.
 MSmits: thats all you need really, the better you are, the more you can do here, but even with just that, you can try easy puzzles and clashes
 MSmits: and some bot games
 The_Auditor: cool. thanks
 dbdr: take small steps
 dbdr: try to get into the top 2M&#160;;)
 dbdr: did we just pass 2M?
 MSmits: wow nice
 The_Auditor: 2M users here?
 The_Auditor: how many active?
 dbdr: about 10
 MSmits: The_Auditor I think a few 100 at once
 MSmits: not all chatting here
 MSmits: some also just code offline and come here to submit
 MSmits: so they're not even logged in
 MSmits: during contests it is several thousand
 MSmits: it's not always the same people either, people come and go
 mountaingo: yes
 aCat: dbdr :D
 aCat: 11 count this cat in
 The_Auditor: is anybody on discord ^_^
 dbdr: it's even true, given the right base
 aCat: yeah, people watch over discord
 MSmits: isn't that true for most numbers?
 mountaingo: why programmers are known to be nerds and whitout social skills?
 MSmits: I'm a nerd with social skills but no social interest
 MSmits: there is a difference between having no social skills and no social interests :P
 mountaingo: ye ye 
 mountaingo: but if you don`t use it you lose it
 The_Auditor: programmers that are not nerds are known to not be good programmers
 TheSpiffiest: anyone from google here?
 MSmits: I can't lose it, I am a teacher :P
 aCat: MSmits ths pandemy cut off 99% of my social
 MSmits: TheSpiffiest we have at least one, probably more
 aCat: i.e. live interaction with students
 MSmits: aCat yeah it has not affected me much aside from the work thing
 jacek: me too
 jacek: well i have to wear mask at shops
 aCat: ^^'
 MSmits: yes, but... my country has gone for physical teaching since this week
 TheSpiffiest: Ha! The pandemic had almost no effect on my social life... I wear a mask to get groceries, but that's about it.
 MSmits: we dont wear masks to get groceries
 aCat: if not work and yeah wearing masks, there was no diffrerence for me even during 'lockdown'
 jacek: and i learned how to shave my head
 TheSpiffiest: I've got my family I hang out with and that's about it.  I study 4 hours a day if I'm not working
 jacek: so even less awkward silence at barber
 MSmits: btw, about that. Earlier today I saw the manager of the supermarket stand really close to two kids, so I asked her about it later because that didn't look too safe
 MSmits: turns out they were trying to steal stuff :P
 TheSpiffiest: I got something like a cross between a mohawk and mullet
 eulerscheZahl: playing soccer was forbidden for some months here.that's how my social life suffered.
 TheSpiffiest: Sokka hair from Last Airbender
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl but you didnt break anything either, so there's that
 eulerscheZahl: injured my shoulder just in time before
 MSmits: oh right, I remember
 Memo12334: if I studied BFS and still can't solve skynet revolution , does that mean codingame is not for me
 eulerscheZahl: episode 1? there's a simple insight so you don't even need BFS
 MSmits: is that the first skynet?
 Memo12334: ye
 eulerscheZahl: so, let's give into the problem...
 Memo12334: do you mean without BFS?
 eulerscheZahl: how many exits can a node be next to?
 Memo12334: 2 max
 volkarion: I've spent like 3 days on The Labryinth. I keep messing up the back tracing.
 eulerscheZahl: read again!
 MSmits: volkarion the labyrinth is pretty hard
 Memo12334: oh 1 ofc 
 MSmits: so thats ok
 Memo12334: lol or else you could never win
 eulerscheZahl: so, with only 1 exit per node:
 eulerscheZahl: if the virus is on a node and the exit is next: what should you do?
 jacek: make entire lockdown
 Memo12334: close that link
 eulerscheZahl: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: and if there is no exit nearby?
 Memo12334: close the node with the least neighbours?
 eulerscheZahl: cutting any node would be fine
 eulerscheZahl: as you can always cut the exit when the virus is next
 eulerscheZahl: so: next to exit? cut linkotherwise: cut random
 eulerscheZahl: no BFS needed
 MSmits: you do need it for skynet two right?
 MSmits: I remember it was pretty difficult
 Memo12334: hmm ok , I will do it that way I guess. May I also know how people solve it with BFS?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, part 2 requires more effort
 MSmits: Memo12334 let me see if i did 1 with bfs, not sure
 Memo12334: part is PhD in physics
 Memo12334: 2*
 eulerscheZahl: why physics?
 Memo12334: because abstract thinking idk
 MSmits: lol my skynet 1 solution is 250 lines 
 Memo12334: WUT
 Memo12334: MSmits u always have those 300 ifs or 1000 lines solves xD
 MSmits: nah this is just because i solved this when i was with CG as long as you are I think
 The_Auditor: anybody got hired through this site?
 MSmits: I didnt know much back then
 eulerscheZahl: my first solution has 46 lines, most is input parsing and such
 bruddah: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1346982794fc6b0c719acfb7e40b62706425530">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1346982794fc6b0c719acfb7e40b62706425530</a>
 Memo12334: you didnt use bfs right meneer
 MSmits: I did
 eulerscheZahl: 55 to get the bonus achievement
 MSmits: small part of my solution:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/258d3588-151c-477f-bf13-fdbb0ec0bf57">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/258d3588-151c-477f-bf13-fdbb0ec0bf57</a>
 Memo12334: Smits what resources u had read to implement bfs
 MSmits: i just googled everthing i could find about bfs 
 Memo12334: Like I wanted to do bot programming after this and I read that BFS is important there and other algos :S
 MSmits: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: that efficient remove :D
 bruddah: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1346982794fc6b0c719acfb7e40b62706425530">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/report/1346982794fc6b0c719acfb7e40b62706425530</a> 
 MSmits: great isnt it&#160;:)
 bruddah: someone's solution is 3809 characters
 eulerscheZahl: you improved a lot since
 MSmits: yeah
 Memo12334: MSmits may I ask what people find with BFS in this challenge
 Memo12334: like distance between what
 MSmits: between the current location of the thingy and the exit i guess
 Astrobytes: nodes in the graph
 MSmits: and i also calculate the path and cut a node on that path
 Memo12334: wdym Astrobytes , the nodes or the node and exit
 MSmits: if you cut a link on the shortest path, you may make the path longer
 Astrobytes: The vertices of the graph (the nodes and exit) I meant
 Astrobytes: bloody terminology
 MSmits: Memo12334 if you find a BFS example on google and you substitute the origin with the virus and the destination with the exit, just cut a link on the path
 MSmits: that is if you want to BFS this, it's not really necessary
 Astrobytes: It was you I gave the redblobgames link to Memo12334 right?
 Memo12334: yes I read that a lot :S
 MSmits: it's great
 Memo12334: it was good , with animation n stuff
 Astrobytes: There's even full implementations there so you can work through it line by line and understand it
 MSmits: there's also some good stuff about hex grids on there
 Astrobytes: ^
 jacek: you like hexes dont you
 Memo12334: yes I in that tab , he be doing the frontier
 MSmits: I played yavalath with my class yesterday&#160;:)
 MSmits: I lost :P
 Astrobytes: It's a great site in general tbh
 Astrobytes: lol gg MSmits
 jacek: you played without books?
 dbdr: MSmits: noob&#160;;)
 MSmits: well it was me vs 20 of them :p
 MSmits: 20 brains vs me and i never played the game before ;p;
 Memo12334: but there are more exit nodes , so you find with BFS the shortest exit and block those neighbours or what?
 dbdr: did they vote what to play?
 dbdr: more is not always better
 jacek: did you play on real board?
 MSmits: I projected a picture on the board
 MSmits: we used markers
 MSmits: and you're right dbdr, a few smart people domintated
 MSmits: dominated
 jacek: should make them play against your bot
 MSmits: but that's fine, it was mostly to fill the last 10 minutes and it was fun
 MSmits: yeah they asked me if I ever played against my bot
 dbdr: you should make them write a bot
 MSmits: this was a physics class though
 MSmits: first class of the year, mostly introductory stuff
 dbdr: analog bot then
 MSmits:  i did the game because it's part of what i do in my free time
 MSmits: as a teacher you're supposed to share a bit of that
 MSmits: also my python TTT bot was broken :P
 MSmits: whats an analog bot?
 Astrobytes: Non-digital
 MSmits: thanks Astrobytes, very helpful :P
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 MSmits: which reminds me, sarcasm and facemasks dont go well together
 Astrobytes: tell me about it lol
 jacek: analog bot? like shannon's hex machine?
 Astrobytes: yeah, make them build a Yavalath machine 
 MSmits: oh, like a chess bot that actually moves the pieces with a robot arm?
 jacek: i think chemistry class would love yavalath <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.redd.it/eemtptywzfb01.jpg">https://i.redd.it/eemtptywzfb01.jpg</a>
 jacek: the turk :v
 MSmits: I would have loved hexpaper when i was working on Y
 MSmits: didnt realize that existed somehow
 jacek: physics teachers dont need chemistry?
 Astrobytes: meh, using hex paper is cheating in organic chem :P
 MSmits: jacek nope
 jacek: then how do you make meth
 MSmits: chemists need physics though
 MSmits: methodology?
 Astrobytes: biologists do, and chem needs physics
 Astrobytes: ah beat me again 
 Astrobytes: meth is chemistry jacek
 Memo12334: max 3 plants MSmits
 Memo12334: (add delete reaction option)
 MSmits: ah, wiet
 MSmits: never done that
 Astrobytes: wiet == weed?
 MSmits: I had an uncle that made everyone in the family have the maximum numbe r of weed plants
 MSmits: yeah Astrobytes
 MSmits: when he was young that is
 MSmits: by the way
 Astrobytes: yay, ik kan Nederlands spreken
 MSmits: yep you can
 Astrobytes: lol why
 MSmits: this uncle was one of the original programmers at IBM
 Astrobytes: Just for himself?
 MSmits: he's retired now
 MSmits: yeah Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: lol, what a guy
 Memo12334: wow
 MSmits: he's cool
 Astrobytes: Most programmers I know only do psychedelics, no weed (too strong these dfa
 Astrobytes: *days)
 MSmits: most programmers i know are you guys
 Astrobytes: (that do anything that is)
 MSmits: no idea what you're all on
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 jacek: :expresionless:
 Astrobytes: Strictly prescription only here lol
 MSmits: my only addiction is diet coke with no caffeine
 Astrobytes: damn, I hate the taste of diet soft drinks. Though I don't drink any at all these days
 MSmits: ah, I dont mind it
 MSmits: though if i drink non-diet it does taste good, bit sweet
 Astrobytes: I can detect the taste of the sweetener and it makes me gag
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: I do react badly to some sweeteners, but not Aspartam
 Astrobytes: If you don't drink it for a while, then go back to it, you can totally taste it
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: the phosphoric acid is so heavy it drowns out the taste anyway
 Astrobytes: Don't let me stop you, just my taste&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Haha yeah
 JBM: oh my, the entire night gang is here
 MSmits: am I in your gang?
 JBM: are you here?
 MSmits: yeah
 JBM: ^
 EcksDee: if its to avoid suger, i read somewhere that some sweeteners is turned into sugar in your system, or at least something with more calories than it has in the bottle
 MSmits: do we have gang colors
 JBM: not yet
 JBM: just don't pick orange
 Astrobytes: "night gang" excellent
 Astrobytes: Hahaha EcksDee you did it
 Memo12334: if I get rlly gut in codingame , will I able to get a job when I grow up
 MSmits: EcksDee do you mean violating the law of conservation of energy?
 JBM: yes
 EcksDee: xD
 JBM: not necessarily because od CG
 EcksDee: did it yesterday
 Astrobytes: Awesome "xD"
 EcksDee: thermodynamics smermodynamics
 MSmits: is EcksDee Scarfield?
 Memo12334: JBM how did ya get good enough of being able to do very hard if I may ask
 Astrobytes: yes MSmits
 JBM: practice
 MSmits: ok
 EcksDee: yea, it doesnt make sense now you say it 
 JBM: just practice
 JBM: maybe reading some books too, hard to tell
 Memo12334: hmm ok sir
 JBM: very hard just means "could take long to understand"
 JBM: but seldom "hard to understand"
 Astrobytes: I just imported the brain module. Worked for me.
 JBM: now shag it
 Astrobytes: Hahahahaha
 JBM: ;p
 Memo12334: sry for polluting the chat btw
 JBM: polluting?
 JBM: you're what makes it alive
 Astrobytes: Yeah shame on you, that's JBMs job
 Memo12334: ye when I asked something the chat got killed
 Astrobytes: And don't be daft, you're not polluting if you're asking pertinent questions 
 EcksDee: you might even involuntarilly give someone a tip from asking questions :p
 Astrobytes: ^he knows
 JBM: he's in da gang
 EcksDee: shh
 JBM: xd
 Astrobytes: Codingang
 EcksDee: xD
 EcksDee: i have a problem, i know
 JBM: now am i going to manage to complete that puzzle after i've apero'd and dined
 JBM: or is that just wishful thinking
 Astrobytes: Only if you forget your digestif
 JBM: can't now she's watching
 Astrobytes: :D
 EcksDee: lol my father seriously hides candy from his GF
 JBM: she can have the candy
 EcksDee: but not the stiffydigs
 Astrobytes: The er... what?
 JBM: no clue here
 EcksDee: digestives.. digestiffs.. dig stiffies.. ehm works in dansih
 Astrobytes: You know what a 'stiffy' is in English right?
 EcksDee: i feel like ishouldnt google it?
 JBM: i don't
 EcksDee: xD
 Astrobytes: Oh please do google it
 JBM: some form of a joint?
 Astrobytes: Ecks Dee 
 JBM: or a boner?
 Astrobytes: the latter, yes
 EcksDee: lol
 JBM: ok, half transpareant
 Memo12334: could be stiffy shoulders
 Astrobytes: So, like he said, she can have the candy but doesn't get digs on the stiffy
 JBM: total better meaning
 EcksDee: xD sigh
 Astrobytes: He's keeping that to himself
 JBM: aim tight
 EcksDee: 4 days left on TvsC
 JBM: until the next update
 Hjax: i want a new contest
 JBM: make one
 Hjax: &gt;:(
 JBM: i'll probably host an "off" TVC one when it's out
 Hjax: TVC?
 JBM: but i'm not ready on the merchandising front yet
 JBM: check for the emoji in the contributions tab
 JBM: there's tvc
 JBM: do add an upvote O:-)
 JBM: makes the toad crazy
 JBM: priceless
 EcksDee: xD he doesnt like it?
 JBM: he doesn't like that it gets votes
 JBM: cf his rant in the "ALL GLORY" puzzle, same page
 JBM: (which you can upvote too, can't hurt)
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't care about your upvotes
 JBM: wait
 JBM: how are you still up
 JBM: i've been lied to
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't want to see the troll game in the multiplayer section. i don't see strategic depth there
 EcksDee: oh the RR, have upvoted&#160;:)
 JBM: your loss
 JBM: EcksDee: you're totally in da gang
 eulerscheZahl: about to go offline. but still here atm
 JBM: i don't get how you don't get it
 JBM: oh well
 JBM: i'll get (over) it
 eulerscheZahl: don't get what? the depth in the game?
 JBM: that-a one
 Astrobytes: Thibaud give you any feedback yet eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: of course there are better decisions and worse. e.g. throwing all stones at once in turn 1 is bad
 JBM: that's the easy choices yes
 eulerscheZahl: but still feels quite random to me in total
 JBM: but that's only "feel"
 JBM: it's really not that much
 eulerscheZahl: i know that there is some mathematical backgrond
 JBM: it's nash and meta
 Astrobytes: Sure it has some game theoretic value to it
 eulerscheZahl: "and meta" exactly
 Astrobytes: see
 JBM: and both will reveal a lot better in multi, with more games
 eulerscheZahl: still very rock-paper-scissors prone IMO
 JBM: (and also when i can find some more serious time to put repeat play in place
 jacek: i wonder how MSmits gonna prepare book for that
 JBM: i wouldn't be so sure
 JBM: but then again... onyl one way to know
 eulerscheZahl: @Astrobytes no further feedback, still waiting for julien
 Astrobytes: Ah OK
 eulerscheZahl: and now i'll leave
 JBM: i'll admit the contrib section doesn't help, with ~30 games played
 Astrobytes: gn euler
 JBM: gn8
 EcksDee: gn
 Memo12334: gn
 Memo12334: the king of cg
 EcksDee: yea, the achievements seem to have boosted the contributions
 JBM: for better OR WORSE
 EcksDee: but im still a proud bronze level in coding speed
 JBM: wht does that even mean
 JBM: that the clash one?
 Astrobytes: Me too, me too
 EcksDee: ye
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed
 Memo12334: ecksdee are you a gamedev
 EcksDee: nope
 JBM: we kind of all are, here
 EcksDee: mechanical engineer
 Memo12334: woah, and you do cg
 EcksDee: yup
 Memo12334: CNC programming will be ez for ya
 Astrobytes: Hey I'm technically a biologist
 EcksDee: had 2 week course in python some years ago, didnt want to forget what little i have learned, found CG, and got hooked about a year ago
 Astrobytes: (we kept him)
 EcksDee: xD
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: walked into a strange love story Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why would you not have a lot of time to code
 AntiSquid: ah chat scroll lol ... was reading the lines about gf and candy
 AntiSquid: maybe because my pc is busy running something the background Automaton2000&#160;!! :o
 Automaton2000: i guess a bit of free time
 AntiSquid: yes
 Astrobytes: ML related?
 AntiSquid: ya
 Astrobytes: Anything interesting?
 AntiSquid: feels lazy though, import model and train 
 aCat: Astrobytes nice idea
 AntiSquid: just trying to better understand what works best for what dataset
 aCat: I'll ad dthe tag :P
 Astrobytes: Definitely part of it aCat&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Well still worthwhile then AntiSquid
 aCat: you can't search puzzles by tag?
 Astrobytes: You can
 Astrobytes: eg. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-comprehension">https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-comprehension</a>
 JBM: eheh
 aCat: but mot via search field
 Zm4j: does in ultimate tic tac toe validActionCount count only spaces that i haven't been on, or does it count all free spaces on the board?
 Astrobytes: No aCat, that is a rather annoying non-feature
 EcksDee: your valid moves according to rules Zm4j
 EcksDee: or the number of them
 aCat: I was thinking should I add A* for the JS puzzles tag... :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Yes
 EcksDee: if you are sent to a full/won small-board, all empty spaces are a valid move, but otherwise only the empty spaces in the small-board you are sent to
 Astrobytes: @aCat: I mean it's an A* improvement at it's core so yeah
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 Zm4j: i want to play for wood league that puts 'X' on random available space using function rand()%number of available spacesbut it says invalid action
 Astrobytes: Right, I'm out for tonight (not doing an euler, restringing and cleaning my guitar&#160;;) )gn all
 aCat: bye
 Memo12334: lol im passing the first 2 testcases only , man IM DUM
 JBM: but it gets better by the minute
 Memo12334: yall got the problem solving genes
 JBM: pretty much
 AntiSquid: blender getting big sponsors <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cheB3jMG78">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cheB3jMG78</a> wonder how that pushes the user friendliness
 reCurse: Autodesk will go down in history as a choking of Blackberry proportions
 reCurse: I hope anyway
 AntiSquid: .
 Memo12334: anyone online that knows C++?
 Memo12334: I don't see why my functio nis not working rlly , 
 Memo12334: gives error no such link for skynet rev ep1
 jacek: then you must be doing somehting wrong
 Memo12334: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/469acf0f-b908-4bae-bc6d-543976341802">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/469acf0f-b908-4bae-bc6d-543976341802</a>
 Memo12334: the 2 nested for loop thing give index the wrong value
 Memo12334: nvm
 Memo12334: the for loops should be switched probably
 Memo12334: nope idk
 jacek: do you delete the edges afterwards
 Memo12334: oh no
 Memo12334: hmm why and how would I do that
 Memo12334: or else it can go to wrong neighbour , ye 
 Memo12334: it's bidirectional so 
 Memo12334: printed the links and there is no links with those indexes so does not have to do with erasing the edges :S
 Memo12334: nvm found lol
 Memo12334: gg
 Memo12334: ?purge 10
 AntiSquid: is that a twitch command? 
 Memo12334: no discord
 JBM: what's it do?
 Memo12334: purge 10 messages 
 Hjax: oh the map has certs now, interesting 
 JBM: errrr if u say so
 Hjax: the whole map thing seems kind of silly to me tbh
 Hjax: weow silver level coding speed
 JBM: yup
 Insufficient: hey guys, have they fixed that bug on the contribution map path yet?
 JBM: which one
 Insufficient: Comment on a contribution
 JBM: oh that's horrible
 JBM: that's worth xp?
 JBM: no wonder it's such a dumpster fire now
 Insufficient: I remember when it came out one of the CG staff said in a forum thread that it was broken atm but that was weeks ago
 JBM: wouldn't know
 JBM: got the xp from that one on day one
 Insufficient: the true big brain move
 JBM: apparently
 austin0209: hello
 thismarvin: hello world
 Schwase: just won first clash
 Schwase: ggez
 Enfields: Hey Question , i am just starting here and i am solving the 2d array chess problem, i like to write in pycharm first , but i don't know what is the format of the input of the board , is it a string&#160;? a nested array&#160;?
 LynneZoe: hello guys
 Frankich: Enfields i would say string if you are talking about the input on CG
 Frankich: the inputs are always string
 Enfields: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8d3ceb60-3c6a-4cb9-8161-43a0ec2b449f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8d3ceb60-3c6a-4cb9-8161-43a0ec2b449f</a>
 Frankich: that you have to parse and cast if neede
 Frankich: this is multiline string right&#160;?
 Enfields: so if it i need it in a nested array , i will need to split it using new line right
 Enfields: yes thats correct
 Frankich: if i understood correctly what you, yes you have to split it into a array
 Frankich: what you meant*
 Enfields: great thanks man
 Schwase: perfect numbers &lt;3
 volkarion: Ok.... so I have to type somewhere.. took me like 4 days but I finally solved Labyrinth with 100%! I'm pretty pumped. Thank you for coming to my Ded Talk.
 Schwase: congrats volkarion
 volkarion: &lt;3
 Frankich: gz
 Schwase: forgot a }
 Schwase: get a 0% in clash
 Schwase: nice
 Frankich: fast typer as i see
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: made sure to close my braces that time
 Frankich: hehe
 Schwase: we meet again
 Frankich: hopefully we will have a shortest :innocent:
 Schwase: yes
 Frankich: you won't use java right&#160;?
 Schwase: oh golf
 Schwase: hate that
 Schwase: cant
 Frankich: ahah
 Schwase: BRUH
 Frankich: \o/
 Frankich: will you do it in java&#160;?
 Schwase: unfortunately
 Schwase: it is all i know
 Schwase: itll be pretty good tho
 Schwase: not winning
 Frankich: should i try too :smirk:
 Schwase: but impressive i hope
 Frankich: ,
 Schwase: 26
 Schwase: wow
 Schwase: i lost
 Frankich: ruby, not fair
 MSmits: learn ruby
 Frankich: ahahah
 MSmits: you're good at reverse i see
 Frankich: learn perl or bash then, it's more worth
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: do that&#160;:)
 Frankich: hehe
 MSmits: or join us in the bot arena's  for more fun
 Frankich: quite bad at it unfortunatly
 MSmits: so was I at first
 Frankich: dude.. you beated me in like 3 month
 Schwase: my print statement is longer than 26
 MSmits: oh, you've been with us longer than I have?
 MSmits: sorry did not know
 Frankich: i'm not really talkative
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: you are my opposite
 Schwase: gg
 Frankich: but yeah here from 2016
 Schwase: 10 times more characters
 MSmits: nice, I think I joined 2018
 Schwase: i joined from playing coders strike back
 Frankich: and didn't try the smitsimax yet
 MSmits: dont worry about that algorithm really. It's pretty niche. Only useful in some specific circumstances
 MSmits: happens to work well in csb
 MSmits: but other stuff does too
 Schwase: SHORTEST CODE
 Schwase: AGAIN
 Frankich: i know but I guess i didn't code seriously here since 2018 i guess
 Frankich: and had a blank year
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Frankich: so i really far behind you all guys
 MSmits: depends on who you're comparing with really. I can point to some guys I am far behind also
 DomiKo: catching up is the best
 Frankich: well basically i would say the top 100-80 on every contest
 MSmits: most of the top 100 in most contests ranks below you Frankich
 MSmits: they often join for the contest,but dont do much else on codingame
 Frankich: true DomiKo
 Frankich: ranks means nothing
 MSmits: well it means something, just not as much as people at first think
 Frankich: just have to grinf multi and you're top 100 quite easely
 MSmits: yes, but you do need to be able to get to legend in those multis
 MSmits: or at least high gold
 MSmits: that's not doable for many players
 MSmits: also if it takes too much time, you wont manage it either
 DomiKo: to reach top 100 you have to spend big amount of time so that mean something
 DomiKo: top100 right now is on 70K cp 
 Frankich: well i don't see it as unreachable in less than 2 month honestly, if i get into it as i used to
 Schwase: DAMN RUBY
 Frankich: but i'm pretty everyone can grind it with the proper time
 Frankich: pretty sure
 DomiKo: not really i guess
 DomiKo: reaching high gold is really hard sometimes
 DomiKo: or I'm just a noob :cold_sweat:
 DomiKo: :sweat:
 Frankich: i would agree of some, but not most of them honestly
 Schwase: is it impolite to launch a clash if you are the room's host?
 Schwase: or should you wait?
 Frankich: and i don't think you are if you are 121st
 Frankich: do as you want i guess, i don't think anybody will blame you
 Schwase: ANOTHER SHORTEST
 Schwase: OMG
 DomiKo: i have that one too
 DomiKo: hate*
 Frankich: you have some good places i few multi though like 39th in BttC, i'm far from this level
 Schwase: s = input()print("("+s[0:3]+") "+s[3:6]+"-"+s[6:])
 Schwase: bruh
 Schwase: i cant compete using java
 Schwase: holy cow
 Schwase: my code was 200+ characters
 Schwase: that one is 51
 MSmits: I got a pro tim for you Schwase
 Schwase: my strats for code golf are "only use one line" and "dont add extra spaces"
 MSmits: tip that is
 Schwase: dont use java
 MSmits: bro is shorter than bruh
 Schwase: i know i know
 MSmits: -1 char
 Schwase:&#160;:|
 Schwase: wp
 DomiKo: haha
 MSmits: :P
 Schwase: AHHHHHHHHHH
 Schwase: ANOTHER CODE GOLF
 Schwase: THATS LIKE 4 IN A ROW
 DR1Rush: Please test this new clash of code create for me <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53544b18608c3c96fe494cc25b7e177951af">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53544b18608c3c96fe494cc25b7e177951af</a>
 DR1Rush: The problem is very good
 Schwase: damn close one
 Schwase: gg
 Schwase: 35 seconds
 Schwase: not bad
 Schwase: heh heh
 Schwase: 34 seconds lets goo
 Schwase: short code? submit, take the loss, next clash
 itzblinkzy: yepp
 itzblinkzy: theres just some clashes that are too hard for my brain to comprehend
 Schwase: java script yep you know
 Schwase: gg
 itzblinkzy: nice
 Schwase: that one was lots of words
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: i love speed coding
 Schwase: just a huge rush
 DR1Rush: gg
 Schwase: where in DR are you from?
 Schwase: i visited punta cana last summer
 Schwase: code golf is doo doo
 Schwase: i need a no golf mode
 Schwase: meant to say winter
 Zm4j: I think it is a nice puzzle for clash of codes, DR1Rush, and I think it could work for all 3 modes  : )
 DR1Rush: IÂ´m from Dominican Republic/ Santo Domingo
 DR1Rush: Good Zm4j, I put for the 3 modes
 DR1Rush: I will put it*
 DR1Rush: I would appreciate if you shared the clash of code that I made to be accepted soon
 Zuabros: AlkhilJohn stays all day long at clash of code
 itzblinkzy: its a bot
 DR1Rush: Lol, really
 DR1Rush: He its a bot?
 FrostedSentry: ayoooooooo
 Schwase: aye
 Schwase: yo
 Schwase: 75%
 Schwase: but why
 Schwase: big oof
 DR1Rush: Schwase, where are you from?
 Schwase: philadelphia
 coderinblack: clash anyone
 Zuabros: im with you coderin
 coderinblack: alr
 Zuabros: tho C# is a sure lose in golf
 Laminator: hahaha
 Schwase: bro that puzzle was kinda nuts
 Schwase: it took me too long to orient myself
 Schwase: i know to have solved it now but i didnt feel like it since you already won
 Zuabros: i had issues with formatting
 Zuabros: the zeroes
 Schwase: theres a laminator where i work and it always is so hot
 Schwase: wdym Zuabros
 Zuabros: here I go again
 Schwase: uh oh
 Schwase: omg
 Schwase: ok that clash
 Schwase: had an alternative solution
 Schwase: you take the number in the 1s place of each number
 Schwase: and subtract the lower one from the higher one
 Schwase: oh
 DR1Rush: 8*8*h
 Schwase: im stupid
 Schwase: i divided
 DR1Rush: is very easy
 Schwase: i was forgetting the reverse lol
 Schwase: i divided instead of multiplying
 Schwase: no need to brag haha
 Zuabros: damn 90%
 Zuabros: it passed all tests
 Schwase: in clash?
 Zuabros: yup
 Schwase: ouch
 Schwase: edge cases i gues
 DR1Rush: when i see 1 as input and ouput 64, the answer is 8*8*h lol
 DR1Rush: another?
 Schwase: youve seen that puzzle before?
 Zuabros: nope
 Zuabros: started clashing today
 Schwase: was asking dr1
 DR1Rush: noo
 DR1Rush: I never see this before
 Schwase: ok yeah i got it in the same time as you
 Schwase: but im just rarted
 Zuabros: i dont like much codingame style to use output as result
 Zuabros: forces me to use GOTOs
 Zuabros: instead of just returning the result
 Laminator: wow what a variety of languages
 Laminator: It does allow you to have outputs of multiple lines. making pretty pictures
 Zuabros: in codesignal we usually output arrays
 Zuabros: as reults
 Zuabros: but the gaming approach we have here is better
 Laminator: Yeah, I've learned a lot by losing to good programmers. 
 Laminator: I wish sharing code was the default
 Zuabros: me too
 Zuabros: or we had an option "always share"
 wulymammoth: i don't understand this problem
 wulymammoth: lol
 DR1Rush: this problem is very confused
 wulymammoth: i'm hoping to look at someone's solution (if any of us solve it)
 wulymammoth: :confused:
 Schwase: NOOOOOO
 Schwase: 75%
 Schwase: OMFG
 wulymammoth: lol -- at least you're making progress
 Schwase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72b507a3-e03c-44e7-b2f3-dfd8e475df41">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72b507a3-e03c-44e7-b2f3-dfd8e475df41</a>
 Schwase: i could still win lol
 wulymammoth: oh!!! i see
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: please throw lol
 wulymammoth: jeez
 Schwase: OMG
 wulymammoth: i'm not competing in this one
 wulymammoth: dinner time
 wulymammoth: lol
 Schwase: IT WAS &lt;= and i did &lt;
 Schwase: wow
 Schwase: big sad
 wulymammoth: yikes
 wulymammoth: you can still win
 Schwase: lesson learned
 Schwase: i dont care about learning, im glad i know why i got one wrong
 Schwase: im very glad in fact
 Schwase: lol
 wulymammoth: btw how do you get a pastebin?
 Schwase: just copy code
 Schwase: and thats how it formats
 itzblinkzy: should i be practicing code here, I started last month but I can't do most of the clashes.
 wulymammoth: it's okay -- i think most of us struggle a bit and i thought I was okay at these problems
 wulymammoth: save for competitive programmers
 wulymammoth: rolling through these like it's a warm up
 Schwase: oooooooooof
 Schwase: LOL
 Schwase: LOLOLOLOL
 DR1Rush: lol
 wulymammoth: which I think Schwase is?
 DR1Rush: 1 second
 Schwase: gg
 Schwase: wp
 wulymammoth: hahaha terazoid
 wulymammoth: from behind!
 wulymammoth: oof
 Schwase: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fd1c3c51-dfea-4861-9aca-0e53f63de032">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fd1c3c51-dfea-4861-9aca-0e53f63de032</a>
 Schwase: im not a competitive coder lol
 Schwase: not clash wise at least
 Schwase: ive done competitions
 Schwase: but not on cg
 Schwase: just puzzles
 Schwase: ive 100% easy and im at 70% on medium
 wulymammoth: oh you go to Rennaisler
 wulymammoth: can't spell that right
 wulymammoth: good school
 wulymammoth: funny that you're using java as a physics major
 Schwase: where are you from?
 Schwase: btw beasted that clash lol
 Schwase: fruit counting
 Schwase: easy
 Schwase: thanks JBM
 Schwase: do practice puzzles tho, i really appreciate those puzzles
 Schwase: they also wont pressure you and you can learn to write programs
 Schwase: wuly?
 Schwase: nope
 Schwase: not doing code golf
 Zuabros: I can give you a hint
 Zuabros: create yourself a desktop programa that will trim your code
 Zuabros: automatically
 Zuabros: then you just cut and paste it
 Schwase: java
 Schwase: is the only language i know
 Zuabros: I do it in C#
 Zuabros: even bigger
 Schwase: i code in main
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: im not a real programmer
 Schwase: im just a physics major who loves math and problem solving
 Zuabros: Im a doctor
 Zuabros: not an issue
 Schwase: have you heard of new world?
 Zuabros: new world?
 Zuabros: nope
 Schwase: its a mmo
 Schwase: by amazon
 Schwase: thats where my macros are going next
 Zuabros: playing  Bless Unleashed at xbox lately
 Zuabros: did a WOW bot also
 Zuabros: but then the game got bored
 Zuabros: as it was too easy
 Zuabros: with bot
 Schwase: yeah
 Schwase: i played legends of aria
 Zuabros: just spoiled my fun
 Schwase: and had 4 timber bots
 Zuabros: its quite easy to code a pixel bot
 Schwase: acquire wood
 Schwase: sell wood
 Schwase: buy wood
 Schwase: inflate prices
 Schwase: prosper
 Zuabros: I had a wow bot to farm mobs and get elementals
 Zuabros: then I had lotsa money
 Zuabros: and no challenge anymore
 Zuabros: and quit playing
 Zuabros: duh
 Schwase: new world is like rune scape
 Schwase: but better graphuics
 Schwase: and more stuff
 Schwase: and combat
 Zuabros: Ive been to consoles lately
 Schwase: im excited is what im trying to say haha
 Zuabros: we find less cheating there
 Schwase: im starting classes next monday
 Zuabros: damn alkhiljohn again
 Schwase: so
 Zuabros: this guy spent all day here
 Schwase: damn you again
 Schwase: hahaa
 Schwase: ive been on since like 6
 Schwase: and im up to 3000
 Schwase: pretty good
 DR1Rush: Guys, IÂ´m going, please share my problem <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53544b18608c3c96fe494cc25b7e177951af">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/53544b18608c3c96fe494cc25b7e177951af</a>
 Zuabros: I just had some break to code the gode golf trimmer
 Schwase: havent even gotten to 50 clashes yet
 DR1Rush: Check it, it is very good
 Schwase: already did
 DR1Rush: I know Schwase, thank you bro
 DR1Rush: Bye bye
 Schwase: NOOOO
 Schwase: oh
 Schwase: oof
 Schwase: i misunderstood the problem lol
 DR1Rush: What if N is larger so that the problem has to be solved with a math formula?
 DR1Rush: Schwase? what do you think about it?
 Schwase: 75%
 Schwase: why
 Schwase:&#160;:(
 DR1Rush: Can you aprove my problem?
 DR1Rush: wait it
 DR1Rush: I put it as ready
 Schwase: ZUABROS
 Schwase: WHY 88%
 Schwase: WHY
 Zuabros: idk
 Zuabros: my code was fine
 Schwase: if contains 3,4 5+6 or 2+5 or 1+2
 Schwase: lol
 Schwase: nope
 Schwase: wasnt what i thought it was
 Schwase: hahaha
 Schwase: what was it zua?
 Zuabros: still trying to guess
 Schwase: 50 clashes
 Schwase: nice
 Schwase: im ashamed that clash took me 3 whole minutes
 Zuabros: :d
 Zuabros: Just one my second clash
 Zuabros: in 22 seconds
 Zuabros: :D
 Zuabros: reverese mode, asked smaller of two numers... duh
 Schwase: definitely need to learn ruby
 Schwase: if i want to be competitive
 Zuabros: C# is fine
 Schwase: even python would be an improvement
 Zuabros: even golf can be done, as those are more difficult
 Schwase: i do know python
 Schwase: since im a physics major i use anaconda for labs
 Zuabros: im fine with C#
 Schwase: yessir
 Schwase: we like those
 Schwase: 13 second clash
 Schwase: another one
 Schwase: lets goo
 Schwase: adrenaline pumping so fast
 Schwase: holy crap that was a fast hour that just passed
 Schwase: anyone else find clash extremely addicting
 Schwase: i know the answer to that lol
 Zuabros: yeah, tho it requires some practice in solving those kind of tests
 Zuabros: doing CodeSignal "arcade" mode to full seems enough
 Zuabros: I tried clashing some months ago and was not able to be competitive
 Schwase: gotcha
 Zuabros: with just algorithims, without Linq or Regex
 Schwase: yeah i just dont find any value in extreme code golf
 Zuabros: dont worry too much about golf
 Schwase: i understand why its particular with things like replacing words with single chars but other than that meh
 Schwase: i enjoy making efficient code
 Schwase: with efficient loops
 Zuabros: just try it
 vighnesh153: hi
 Zuabros: I always do golf
 Zuabros: even with C#
 Schwase: if i wanted to do a long puzzle i could do a classic puzzle
 Schwase: ive done almost half of the puzzles in classic so 
 Zuabros: its fun
 Zuabros: just relax and do what you can
 Schwase: yeah
 Schwase: alright
 Schwase: im gonna go for now
 Schwase: nice talking
 Zuabros: use one-letter variables, remove spaces
 Zuabros: remove comments
 Schwase: yeah i know
 Zuabros: thats it
 Schwase: ctrl x
 volkarion: Skynet Episode 1 trophy... to have 50 nodes left on the 4th test. What am I missing. At most I can keep 42...
 volkarion: Oooh might have come up with an idea... going to try something
 volkarion: Got it
 fedtj: hello world
 fedtj: I'm going to hack apple
 fedtj: Is it good idea&gt;
 vighnesh153: yes
 fedtj: and with c++ 
 fedtj: i want to hack
 vighnesh153: try HTML
 fedtj: no html not so good chose for me
 volkarion: CSS should get you there.
 jrke: go for kali linux
 Allis: Kali gave me a virus.

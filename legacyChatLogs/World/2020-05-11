 BenjaminUrquhart: kovi chill
 Jesus_inn_party: you won him?
 BenjaminUrquhart:&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no I lost 
 Jesus_inn_party: :neutral_face:
 Jesus_inn_party: you are still great
 Gonny: damn, how did akara go from 1st to 33rd?
 BenjaminUrquhart: his last submit was 5 hours ago
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's been a lot of leaderboard activity since then
 Gonny: that's a very brutal drop though
 Gonny: can't stop coding!
 BenjaminUrquhart: I dropped 70 places
 BenjaminUrquhart: I know how it feels
 kovi: game is random, and only 70 games, a resubmit may not reach top
 Gonny: yeah I saw
 Gonny: kovi true, and maybe he got pushed for a while before resubmitting, but still seems like an aweful lot to me
 BenjaminUrquhart: Gonny when will you rise over the leaderboard
 shashwat986: How many hours to go for Silver?
 BenjaminUrquhart: ~12 I assume
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's usually noon EST
 shashwat986: cool, ty
 the_joker_100: @BejaminUrqhart lmao u fought me against me?
 BenjaminUrquhart: also, chat server will crash in 5 minutes
 BenjaminUrquhart: the_joker_100 yes
 shashwat986: lol
 shashwat986: where do you guys move then? discord?
 the_joker_100: i m doin that too then
 BenjaminUrquhart: we just don't
 Gonny: Haha BenjaminUrquhart I don't think I'll reach the top 100 in the next couple days, I still have a bunch of things to set up before having anything competitive
 shashwat986: heh
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok, no problem
 Quidome: goodmorning
 BenjaminUrquhart: cue chat server crash, t-minus 1 minute
 Quidome: any news?
 Gonny: how do you know it's gonna crash?
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's done so the past 3 days
 the_joker_100: r u seroius??it crashed yesterday too tho??
 Doju: optimizing precalc is actually much harder than i anticipated&#160;:(
 Doju: path precalc*
 Doju: I thought not calculating the path in both directions for pairs would be twice as fast
 Doju: but it's only a bit faster because checking whether the path exists takes some time
 Doju: oh wait i'm stupid, why am i checking every cell
 thibpat: Hi :wave: I'm streaming my progress on the CodinGame Spring Challenge: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitch.tv/thibpat">https://twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 MonZtaDeluxe: this is not allowed as far as i know
 MonZtaDeluxe: with old contents yes - current content while it's running is not allowed as far as i remember
 MonZtaDeluxe: *contests
 Uljahn: you mean streaming?
 Doju: does anyone know if it's possible to print cProfile output to stderr?
 Uljahn: use pstats
 Uljahn: like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/02777ed1-5d00-4204-a0c9-1c6ae8d803a7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/02777ed1-5d00-4204-a0c9-1c6ae8d803a7</a>
 Doju: thanks Uljahn!
 Jesus_inn_party: guys does any one know when is silver league free to go
 JohnCM: haha competition is fierce
 JohnCM: dropped 100 ranks this morning:)
 Doju: same JohnCM
 JohnCM: yea.. competition is good
 JohnCM: i'm just wondering if i can monte carlo simulate this whole thing
 JohnCM: been thinking about it.. how to do hidden info monte carlo
 JohnCM: that's not my code btw, but yea... i'm just thinking of alternatives
 Uljahn: Jesus_inn_party: Silver opens monday evening (around 6pm)
 Csipcsirip: is there a #pragma in GCC to increase debug level&#160;? 
 Csipcsirip: I got no exception on std boundary errors
 Doju: For some reason the profiler really doesn't like my function
 anid: @uljahn Time in France 6PM?
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/vanhoeve/papers/MAPD_ICAPS_2019.pdf">http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/vanhoeve/papers/MAPD_ICAPS_2019.pdf</a>
 JohnCM: I'm looking at this now: multi-label A* algorithm, wonder if it'll help
 Doju: Uljahn i keep timing out when i run the function through the profiler&#160;:(

 Doju: i don't know what's wrong
 Doju: it works when i run it normally
 Illedan: Good morning
 Doju: mooorning
 jrke: which country
 anid: Hi
 Schneewittchen: Morning
 Illedan: Nice lead for kovi&#160;:)
 Schneewittchen: Motto: The early bird catches the worm?
 Illedan: Still early contest, if this was in 7 days from now.. :scream:
 Doju: Is there any way to see if some of your arena games have timed out
 Doju: other than to watch them all?
 Doju: i can't english ._.
 Doju: other than watching them all*
 AntiSquid: 3625 wow
 kovi: thx illedan. i did resubmit today so it is not singly lucky run, we will see soon in silver recalc
 Doju: kovi how long have you been programming?
 kovi: 36 years
 Doju: wow :o
 AntiSquid: so you can easily get the "junior dev with 5 years experience" jobs eh? 
 AntiSquid: (just a joke about the stupid job advert titles)
 MattSOrme: Anyone got any good resources for route tracking, and move scoring across multiple bots? Getting a bit stuck
 AntiSquid: in other words: does anyone have the solution to the contest&#160;?
 jrke: no solution best bot will win contest
 AntiSquid: see prev reply jrke
 jrke: oh didn't read that
 jrke: By the way antisquid what a jump 96 rank
 AntiSquid: ahm was #60 last night but then tried different vars and then submitted wrong ver
 AntiSquid: and now trying to fix a bug
 AntiSquid: my bot is still very terrible, i can see like 20 different mistakes in it, maybe there's more, but hey we are just in bronze so not many strong bots at the top jrke
 NormantasStankevicius: what time the new league opens?
 AntiSquid: 8 hours from now
 MattSOrme: Im not asking for the code, im asking for the theory
 AntiSquid: yes, the solution . in form of theory
 MattSOrme: then sure
 AntiSquid: i mean that's what people post after the contest in the forum
 ashikujjaman: how to avoid collision?can you give any idea?
 FTGUPP: in coders strike back?
 MattSOrme: apparently any vague help is giving the solution rather than creating healthy competition, so no sorry
 AntiSquid: people give vague help in chat all the time when they talk about it
 SemChumboPT: Good morning
 AntiSquid: you don't need to apologize for asking, but wanted to make you aware of what you are asking
 AntiSquid: good morning SemChumboPT
 sgalasso: Hello, is there a way to print anything on the stderr even if the turn timed out&#160;?
 ashikujjaman: But I can't understand if I command my pac to go the cell x,y then how I will know which cell my pac will go on first move. 
 SemChumboPT: There is no solution, because there is so many ways to do it
 SemChumboPT: you can go after oponents to "eat" them, to block them, or go afters pellets
 SemChumboPT: try to predict "unefficient" dead ends, to not lose time on them, etc
 SemChumboPT: it also depends on the oponent tactic
 AntiSquid: you can always read past postmortems in the forums
 AntiSquid: or try one of the meta heuristics: GA, MCTS ... etc etc
 jrke: hey the input ability to cooldown remains same ie 10 or changes when we apply speed or switch
 AntiSquid: i would go here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/search">https://www.codingame.com/forum/search</a> and type in feedback and strategy  lots of ideas for past contests, some similar to this one  SemChumboPT MattSOrme
 BorisH: SpringChallenge, Bronze League: Di I get this right: Eaten pellets disappear on screen, BUT NOT from game loop's input&#160;?
 BorisH: *Do
 SemChumboPT: Now you only see pellets visible to your pacs
 BorisH: Found my bug, thx
 ashikujjaman: how can I see my prevous league's battle
 MattSOrme: thanks
 Nerchio: my 2 day old version is doing basically the same as todays xD
 jrke: hey anybody knows about bronze's boss
 AntiSquid: released 7 hours from now
 jrke: K
 Doju: Nerchio my current version is actually a bit worse than my 2 day old one
 Nerchio: woopsie
 jrke: how many players will able to reach silver or which rank bot will be boss any idea
 Doju: if the only goal is the rank
 AntiSquid: you can always reach silver later, gates don't close until end of contest so w/e
 jrke: no i am not asking that i am asking is there any idea which rank bot will be bot
 E_pur_si_muove: Will there be cherries and power ups in higher leagues? I set it in the source code, not not in the rules. thx.
 E_pur_si_muove: set = see
 Jesus_inn_party: the silver rank is released 7 hours from now:no_mouth:
 Jesus_inn_party:&#160;?
 Quidome: All the rules are now unlocked!
 Jesus_inn_party: don't think so!
 jthemphill: It's not always possible to tell if you killed an opponent or if they just rounded a corner, right?
 jrke: there will no new rules after bronze as you can see in first line of green box"all rules are now unlocked"
 njaber: yes
 njaber: it's not always possible but you can deduce most cases with other infos like pellets taken, last seen pos, etc
 njaber: but it requires a complex algorithm
 jthemphill: :thumbsup:
 njaber: and hard to make efficient
 Jesus_inn_party: i think there will be new things 
 Jesus_inn_party: maybe not rules but some thing new
 Doju: what can be changed if not the rules?
 Doju: new visuals? :D
 Nerchio: dbdr timeouts? ;p
 AntiSquid: there are no changes doju
 AntiSquid: bronze rules are final
 Doju: Yeah i know
 Doju: that's why i think there won't be any changed
 Doju: changes
 jrke: hey whats use of send parameters to ide
 Quidome: when you see a match and want it for replay
 njaber: and for testing, you could replay the match with a modified AI for example
 Quidome: you get the same opponent and seed
 anid: Seems like the contest will hit 4000 doesnt it?
 Quidome: Will that be an altime high?
 anid: I think "The Accountant" Had 4400+ participants
 Quidome: How long ago was that?
 anid: 3-4 yrs ago? before I started
 Quidome: it's not in CG antmore?
 Quidome: or under another name?
 Doju: Hold on...
 AntiSquid: someone said they submitted all bots, including those that were only testing in the IDE ... so 
 Doju: will DFS be faster than BFS if you're going through the entire tree?
 AntiSquid: 11k &gt; 4.6k
 AntiSquid: this is the contest with the highest submits
 anid: I dont see 11K submits Antisquid?
 anid: when are they going to submit everything?
 njaber: there are 11k registered
 njaber: but not everyone subbmitted
 AntiSquid: anid, "someone said they submitted all bots, including those that were only testing in the IDE ... so "
 Quidome: 3.6l submitted
 Quidome: 3.6k
 anid: K
 AntiSquid: for the accountant i mean
 Doju: Hey, i read this on wikipedia: "When the number of vertices in the graph is known ahead of time, and additional data structures are used to determine which vertices have already been added to the queue"
 Peudoki: hi, does anyone know what time is the new league opening?
 Doju: does that basically mean skipping checking cells that have already been explored
 Doju: waait no.. that can't be it
 SemChumboPT: I hate the down going every time i submit&#160;:/
 Doju: Oh and also, won't not giving cells an "explored" status basically give you all the possible paths that can be taken by a pac given that it doesn't stay put and doesn't speed?
 NapTown: i can't beat my bot from 2 days ago:neutral_face:
 JohnCM: @Doju, you can have an array storing all cells and whether they have been visited by you or opponent. by default all cells (less pac starting positions) are not visited. then slowly update them as you see the visible pellets or you collect pellets.
 JohnCM: an algorithm that efficiently manages information state should get you to top 500 at least
 JohnCM: i did some further refinement and got top 200... haha but nowhere as good as the top 10. they are super efficient at eating the pellets
 Doju: JohnCM i'm trying to precalculate all paths
 JohnCM: well.. what do you mean by precalculation?
 JohnCM: total pellet value? shortest distance?
 Doju: shortest distance
 Doju: from any given cell to any given cell
 JohnCM: oh from any node to any node is it..
 Doju: exactly
 JohnCM: well... one way is to do the shortest path using key intersection nodes (i.e. more than two paths)
 JohnCM: then you effectively reduce your number of nodes to like... say 100?
 Doju: yeah
 JohnCM: then do shortest path from each node to each node
 JohnCM: hopefully it doesn't timeout
 JohnCM: i didn't use something like this though... i just bfs calculate for each pac each time i move them
 Doju: i was initially trying to do that but if i just knock the bfs that i currently have to like a quarter of the time it should be fine
 njaber: I don't think that's nescessary, yu can calculate everything in way less then 1s with standard bfs
 JohnCM: you mean from node to node?
 njaber: Just need to optimize a bit
 Doju: njaber atm mine is timing out
 njaber: yes
 JohnCM: for all nodes?
 JohnCM: haha i couldn't do that
 Doju: although i haven't taken symmetry into consideration yet
 njaber: You should be able to optimize it a bit
 JohnCM: i had to use a heuristic
 njaber: for me all nodes takes 13ms
 Doju: wow.
 JohnCM: how can bfs do that?
 njaber: and I don't even use the symetry optimization
 Doju: what on earth
 JohnCM: i mean... did you start from one node.. then precalculate to all other nodes?
 JohnCM: then repeat for next node
 JohnCM: and so on
 njaber: yes
 Doju: yeah
 JohnCM: oh i see.. but i tried doing the bfs n number of times, where n is the number of nodes
 JohnCM: it timed out
 Doju: like, mine is taking 700 milliseconds on a 33*12 grid
 Doju: that is relatively simple
 Doju: njaber python can't be 50 times slower than c#, can it?
 njaber: Would it be alright topost the code for that specific function or should I not post any code that could help others?
 njaber: Yeah it may be the language
 Doju: umm don't post it
 njaber: I'll dm it to you
 Doju: don't
 njaber: Why?
 offroff: python is extremely slow I'm afraid
 Doju: at most give me a vague explanation of how you're optimizing it
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm</a>
 Maciulis: beats the point of competition
 JohnCM: anyway for all nodes to all nodes there is an O(n^3) method
 JohnCM: floyd warshall
 JohnCM: not sure if it works within 1sec
 JohnCM: and yup i'm using python, which explains why my n repetitions of bfs didn't work in time
 njaber: ok, Idk if there is ny specific optimization I'm doing apart from standard things, I just flood all the grid, it's O(n^2) since each flood cannot take more then 4x the number of nodes (you check 4 neighboors, and never walk back)
 Doju: that's pretty much what i'm doing
 Doju: except i'm also not calculating the same path in both directions
 njaber: Well I guess I can thank C# then
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a> for pathing
 JohnCM: yea i did what you did @njaber, but it timed out haha
 Doju: AntiSquid i'll look into that
 Doju: JohnCM I think we just have to embrace numpy to it's fullest :D
 AntiSquid: i need 4ms to calculate all my bfs distances, unoptimized
 Doju: i'm actually not using it at all atm
 AntiSquid: some languages are very slow
 JohnCM: is C# or C++ faster?
 Doju: i'm pretty sure c++
 AntiSquid: c++
 njaber: I wonder if creating/copying the arrays isn't what's slowing you down, if python has something that makes it recreate the array on some operations you could optimize it but not using those
 njaber: Of course it's C++
 JohnCM: i see.. but how come C# is so popular then?
 njaber: It's way higher level
 AntiSquid: "more readability"
 Doju: njaber i'm actually storing everything on the same array
 njaber: Way easier to code with
 JohnCM: yeah.. i like C# too. quite user friendly
 Doju: maybe i should rewrite the function with a few different arrays and fully numpy'd
 AntiSquid: i find C++ user friendly enough :P
 AntiSquid: it's just that CG doesn't display all the errors, so harder to debug
 JohnCM: haha i used to code with C 10 years ago.. actually it is quite a good language for this competition also. since it is just array parsing
 AntiSquid: need offline setup&#160;:/
 njaber: Doju it's possible some operations work by value instead of reference, effectively recreating all the array eac time, Idk enough python to be sure tho
 Doju: njaber alright. i'll try to optimize this in some ways and report back in a moment
 njaber: I like using C / C++ / C# / JS respectively depending on the level of organization and optimization I want in my code, but I find they are all pretty good languages in their own ways
 JohnCM: all the best! anyway seems like C++ is ruling this competition, perhaps since it is faster
 njaber: I might have to rework my code for C++ wince I have some pretty expensive algorithms running each turn
 AntiSquid: 3 python 3 bots in top 10, very slow language JohnCM 
 njaber: not all bots need speed
 Fangel: well for the moment I never use more than 5ms/turn&#160;:)
 Fangel: I think globally there is more people using C++ than python, that's all for the moment.
 njaber: Wait, I jsut think I thought of a way of doing full tracking of the enemy in almsot constant time
 Fangel: but in a few days, time limit will make a difference for sure
 njaber: I think I just thought*
 hearthewarsong: How do you measure if a version "B" is better than "A". I have some impovements , but I can't test it.  I send in "A" it is 30th, I sent in "B" its 50th, sent in a "A" again its ~40th, then "B" was 12th. Then now "A" is 26th.  Is the leaderboard so instable, or am I messing up something&#160;? 
 SemChumboPT: Other people submit too&#160;:)
 JohnCM: @njaber: beware of full tracking of enemy, there are a lot of possibilities
 njaber: Yes and I think I jsut found a way of reducing all these possibilities to a number capped by the number of cells, and deducing everything from this algorithm
 Cappefra: what time is the silver league opening?
 Riyuk: in 7 hours they said
 njaber: hearthewarsong the quality of a bot changes depending on the meta anyway, only time and a lot of testing, and possiblysubjective testing by manually pitting it against other bots
 njaber: can tell you it's quality
 Cappefra: is there a public place where to get news about leagues opening or stuff like that? Just so I can stop harassing people in the chat&#160;:)
 njaber: how the heck am I so bad at doing coherent messages all the time
 njaber: at writting*
 njaber: frick
 [CG]Thibaud: it usually opens around 12pm EDT Cappefra
 Doju: Is there a way to set up version control if you're using the built-in ide?
 Cappefra: cool thanks
 MattSOrme: how is the leaderboard score calculated? I can only find content for overall codingame ranks
 [CG]Thibaud: no Doju
 Cappefra: but why EDT? I thought Codingame would use standard GMT time in France
 njaber: Doju any time you subbmit your code is saved, you can find it in History
 Doju: okay thanks [CG]Thibaud and njaber
 Thiesjoo: It's 6pm gmt
 Thiesjoo: i think
 [CG]Thibaud: yes, maybe I should always use GMT
 [CG]Thibaud: I think they use EDT in the US
 [CG]Thibaud: MattSOrme it's TrueSkill based
 njaber: Okay my current tracking algorithm can do full tracking even over 50+ turns it seems
 njaber: and it's not even the constant time one
 Nerchio: why dont u submit
 njaber: I jsut need to add a condition ofr dead pacman and pellets which were taken, I already integrate non-taken pellets by supprssing possible paths
 njaber: Because even though I have a great algorithm my AI still isn't doing a single thing with it
 njaber: I want to finalize it
 njaber: then my AI will abuse the shit out of its knowledge
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7c6f2934-6eea-4a04-96e2-e5dba97d6d18">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7c6f2934-6eea-4a04-96e2-e5dba97d6d18</a>
 Vintarel: what do you track?
 njaber: Enemy movements
 Vintarel: but what if you don't see them for plenty of turns?
 Vintarel: i mean, I can't see how track invisible things
 njaber: I already confirmed I can branch all paths over more then 50 turns, and I've got an idea to optimize the hell out of it to allow tracking on even longer periods
 Doju: sorry
 Doju: what
 Doju: 50!?
 njaber: Yeah
 Doju: that's ridiculous
 Doju: its only... 7,6*10^44 different decisions
 njaber: I got a dead pac that I don't recognize as dead in my testing config, and I lose after 80 frames because I disabled my AI, and my algorithm manages to  not time out during all the game
 njaber: I use a trick where instead of tracking all paths I track all paths of a given length that end on a specific cell each turn, which drastically reduces the number of calculations without losing any information
 njaber: Actually I didn't phrase his properly
 njaber: For each cell, I track the number of track of a given length that end on this cell for the given turn
 njaber: of paths*
 MSmits: creepy, a dead pac that isn't dead. 
 MSmits: Zombie pac
 goolmoos: njaber how do you account for variable speeds?
 goolmoos: also, pacs can stand still
 njaber: I calculate how much speed he could have used based on the amount of info I have
 njaber: And I also take standing still into account
 njaber: I have evrything managed
 goolmoos: but you said you track path of a certain length
 njaber: standing still is just a path of the same length that extends 1 turn frther
 JohnCM: haha only that if the possible area of your opponent is very huge, then it is as good as not the info at all
 JohnCM: imagine.. in 10 turns the possibilities are (assuming speed is used): 4*2 + 5 = 13 squares away from starting position
 JohnCM: that's almost half the map already
 njaber: Actually with the info of pellets I've got a very reduced zone for all pacs most of the times
 njaber: + vision
 JohnCM: assuming your pac is nearby, in which case you might already lose out by pellets cause by finding out you go to empty areas
 JohnCM: haha you can try it out.. let me know how good the algo can be
 JohnCM: i'm just not too sure if effectively localizing the enemy is a viable strategy
 njaber: No I don't, my AI aren't even active currently, just the info that I get by "happening" to see, is enough
 JohnCM: ah... then that is possible. it's a by the way thing
 njaber: Yeah tho my future AI might take gathering info into account at some point
 JohnCM: haha but head straight for the pellets rather than the enemy
 JohnCM: i keep losing within the first 50 turns because the top 10 ai just keeps eating and eating non-stop for each pac
 njaber: The really important part for me is knowing which pellets are definitely closer to me then they are to the enmy, that's why I've been working so hard on this algo
 JohnCM: oh.. that part i coded into my algo (the closeness part). very important
 JohnCM: gd luck!
 njaber: thx
 njaber: How do you manage that when you don't see the enemy?
 Doju: I managed to knock a few hunder ms from the path precalc by using deques instead of lists
 JohnCM: @njaber: (massive spoiler) you know the enemy start position by symmetry
 Doju: now if i give up on storing the paths themselves and just store the lengths i think i can knock off another few hundred ms
 JohnCM: XD
 njaber: I mean how do you manage calculate which pellets are closer to you on turns where you don't currently see the enemy and which aren't first turn
 JohnCM: oh... well the closeness measure is mainly for superpellets. after that is free for all
 JohnCM: you can assign effectively the superpellets which are "yours" well, and perhaps ignore those that are not "yours" unless the opponent decides not to take them
 JohnCM: eating the right superpellets is key for a good ai
 JohnCM: while not revealing too much about how I did it, hope this helps
 Doju: JohnCM mine unintentionally ignores the superpellets lmao
 njaber: I'd like to have an algorithm that becomes more similar to a "board game" algorithm which doesn't calculate "how many pellets I'm taking" but the "ratio of how many pellets I'm taking and how many I'm potentially allowing my opponent to take"
 JohnCM: hm that is possible
 JohnCM: but you won't know how many your opponent is taking cause you don't have access to the score
 njaber: That's why enemy tracking is important for me
 njaber: You do have access to the score
 njaber: it's given to you at the beginning of each turn
 JohnCM: so essentially, eating more pellets denies the opponent from eating them
 njaber: yes that's how I want my algorithm to think
 JohnCM: oh damn
 JohnCM: lol i didn't know the score was given
 JohnCM: ok this changes things
 NapTown: that's something i also didn't know :D
 JohnCM: thanks, i think i know how to make my ai better now
 njaber: that's why you pay attention to the rules details XD
 JohnCM: i didn't factor in the score...
 JohnCM: wow
 njaber: Frick, I track the enemy so well but I don't even remember my own pacs movements, now I need to add that part
 Doju: uhhh.. working on a single int didn't change the speed of my flood fill compared to modifying a list on every iteration...?
 StepBack13: Thanks for your conversation njaber/JohnCM. Lots of good tips.
 njaber: Doju then the speed loss must come from some expensive python operation like I was mentionning earlier
 Doju: njaber i guess so. i wish i could profile the whole thing
 JohnCM: @stepback13. treat it as you have perfect knowledge. store all initial cells as having pellets unless confirmed otherwise. use back your same algo for starters
 Doju: but the profiler doesn't like it for some reason
 goolmoos: Doju, I recommend instead of precalculating paths calculating a distance map for eash pos, and extract paths from there when needed
 Doju: goolmoos i'm gonna need them on every move
 Doju: for every cell
 JohnCM: you may not have perfect info, but you have your best guess
 Doju: because i'm gonna do some maths :P
 njaber: Doju you should probably be able to find a list of famously expensive python operations on google
 StepBack13: @JohnCM. thanks. That helps.I need to update algo to find a way to remove cells my pacs have crossed from my "possible pellets" list.
 JohnCM: yup
 JohnCM: then there's the explore-exploit tradeoff: should you go to an area to view more pellets, or eat pellets up. or best to do both at the same time.
 JohnCM: implementing this trick alone should get you a good ai already
 njaber: You should reset each cell visible to your pacs to 0 each turn, then readd the pellet if it's part of the visible pellet list
 njaber: re-add
 Uljahn: Doju: btw you can measure the time elapsed intead of profiling
 Doju: Uljahn i'm measuring elapsed time but it doesn't tell the full story
 Uljahn: or profile locally
 StepBack13: @JohnCM. thanks again. I like this method.@njaber that's interesting... seems like the opposite approach, assume 0 and update if you see it. I prefer assuming 1 and then working to 0 all cells.
 njaber: you assume 1 at the start, what I'm suggesting just allows "updating" visible cells each turn
 JohnCM: @stepback: no problem. hope to see you in the top 200
 Peudoki: we need Silver!
 StepBack13: @njaber ahhhh, that makes sense. @JohnCM haha, not sure I have the time. It took me ~10 hrs to get to Bronze and it seems harder from here. 
 JohnCM: haha see what is best for you
 JohnCM: i'm having so much fun trying ideas. i think i implemented almost 30 versions of my algo already lol
 njaber: I've been coding almost non-stop since the beggining of the challenge, I probably have done 50-55 hours of coding already
 njaber: I like this challenge, I find it really fun
 StepBack13: yeah, that's what I felt would be necessary to get in the top 20-30
 JohnCM: in between i took a break and coded "ghost in the cell", but that turned out to be way harder than this challenge
 StepBack13: I don't want to put my dayjob at stake hahaha
 njaber: I'm not top 20-30 tho XD
 mesavitae: any tips on algorithms to learn for searching, tracking pellet dist by indexes has taken me as far as i can go i think lol
 StepBack13: Yeah, 20-30 is probably me being optimistic, I'm sure there are seriously tough opponents. coded by teams
 AntiSquid: no teams allowed though
 JohnCM: AntiSquid shared this earlier: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html">https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html</a>
 JohnCM: quite a good guide to BFS/Dijkstra/A*
 mesavitae: thank you
 JohnCM: wow kovi has such an extensive lead it is unbelievable
 Nerchio: y
 Peudoki: we need to break his tyranny 
 GreatTux: I tried my bot against kovi yesterday, then I went to sleep, it broke my motivation into pieces
 njaber: I won't have time to finish my bot upgrade for silver I think&#160;: (
 Peudoki: I can beat him like 20%, it's something
 jrke: its going to be silver club today
 Peudoki: when?
 jrke: after 5 and half ours
 njaber: I'm 300th currently, would I pass silver like that?
 jrke: hey i have to ask only only silver open today or gold also
 njaber: Someone told me silver only
 jrke: K
 JohnCM: why 300th cannot be silver? what's the benchmark
 njaber: I'm asking because Idk
 JohnCM: i don't know too, but i would say you should be safe
 jrke: there is no benchmark
 JohnCM: i think just need to beat the boss or something right
 jrke: you have to just be above boss likewise in all leagues 
 njaber: Good, I can continue working on my masterpiece then
 SemChumboPT: Trying to reach top 1500 ignoring opponents 
 JohnCM: lol.. you can work on it for 6 days
 JohnCM: still got time
 Peudoki: I haven't competed before, but I heard silver usually starts around 300th place
 wlesavo: njaber you shouldn't worry, with that commitment you will make it eventually
 JohnCM: @peudoki, that sounds more like gold/legend to me
 Nerchio: legend for sure not ;p
 JohnCM: anyway i'll be happy to make it to gold
 JohnCM: don't need legend
 Peudoki: I wanna be a legend, but it will be hard
 Doju: How can i get the input out of the game so i can "generate" (read it line by line) locally?
 jrke: i am happy in top 1000
 Doju: i'm trying to print it but that only returns like 30 lines
 njaber: I'm always reaching for the top, but I also know I'll fail miserabily
 JohnCM: the codingamers are really intense. like i tried "coders strike back" and can't even reach gold.. lol not that i was trying very hard
 jrke: CSB is very easy till gold
 JohnCM: yea my point exactly
 Peudoki: almost 3k bronzers, so many
 JohnCM: i got stuck at silver lol
 jrke: i passed till silver in just 10 min in CSB
 JohnCM: haha.. that was me too, but i got stuck there for a day
 JohnCM: my algo is perhaps.. 15 lines?
 JohnCM: yea but i was kind of lazy to code more to reach gold
 jrke: no problem use shield and boost at right time
 jrke: and if you stuck in silver than gold will be so hard for you
 jrke: cz every input changes
 JohnCM: haha yup
 jrke: whats your rank in spring challenge
 JohnCM: me?
 jrke: yes
 JohnCM: it fluctuates, but mainly within top 200
 jrke: nice 
 JohnCM: i spent a lot more effort on this one than csb
 jrke: K
 Clagus: I think silver opens today at 18:00 (I would assume CET?)
 njaber: What would happen if player 1 scissors, play2 rock and player 2paper tried to go to the same cell?
 thethiny: I accidentally submitted an empty code
 thethiny: is there a way to get a backup?
 njaber: History
 GreatTux: yes
 thethiny: yes found it, thanks
 GreatTux: History button is on the left panel
 AntiSquid: inside history you can even view the time you submitted at
 Doju: oh my..
 Doju: im doing the most horrendous things atm
 Doju: printing all the inputs to generate myself
 Doju: and getting rid of some things in my bot to make it deterministic
 Doju: so that i can print everything out after finishing a for i in range() loop xD
 Doju: it's still not deterministic...
 Doju: i've commented out everything that can generate random numbers yet the results are different every time
 GreatTux: Do you play against yourself&#160;?
 Doju: yes
 AntiSquid: are there always 4 super pellets?
 Doju: uummm... yes
 njaber: Maybe you have some timing dependent code? Are you using parallelism?
 avdg: use seeded generators?
 Doju: I measure time but don't do anything with it
 avdg: or maybe you use hash tables that are unstable (rare)
 avdg: random generator (ts/js):let seed = 1234567890;const rand = () =&gt; ((seed = (seed * 16807)&#160;% 2147483647) - 1) / 2147483646;
 avdg: ^ the one I use
 avdg: seed can be changed
 Doju: i'm not quite sure what causes it but i'm just gonna try to get some output
 njaber: avdg he said he removed all randomness from his code tho
 jrke: hey what things can we get from seed
 jrke:&#160;?
 avdg: cya, gotta do other stuff&#160;:-)
 njaber: bye
 TheSkolar: Is it known when exactly silver league will open?
 MadKnight: in 4-6hrs
 njaber: most likely in 7 hours
 njaber: wait
 jrke: after 4H50M 
 TheSkolar: k, thanks
 njaber: MadKinght is right
 njaber: I misread the current time
 jrke: 9:30 pm IST
 AntiSquid: 5 hours
 jrke: all the best all coders for silver league
 CRVII: Guys what would be a good tutorial/puzzle too start with machine learning?
 AntiSquid: none on this site
 thethiny: exactly
 thethiny: if you want ML I suggest this:
 AntiSquid: kaggle is better for that CRVII
 JohnCM: can try kaggle yep
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning">https://github.com/jeffheaton/t81_558_deep_learning</a>
 CRVII: Sweet, thanks alot guys!
 jrke: hey when we reach silver then our points become 0?
 wlesavo: jrke there will be a full reran for a whole silver, with more matches also
 wlesavo: it would take a while
 jrke: K
 Doju: yesssss i finally got profiler data out
 Doju: my get_neighbours method takes up almost 2/3 of the time in the precalc
 Doju: nice to know
 Quidome: good question!
 goolmoos: Doju how do you profile?
 Quidome: What would happen if player 1 scissors, play2 rock and player 2paper tried to go to the same cell?
 Doju: okay do ask but don't expect anything prettty 
 Doju: haha
 Doju: so, i printed out all the data in the input
 goolmoos: oh no
 Doju: made a local copy of the bot
 Doju: added an "input" function that has the inputs hardcoded as a string
 goolmoos: and fed the same input
 Doju: and ran it that way
 goolmoos: btw, you can just save the inputs to a txt file and pipe it in
 Doju: how do i save them?
 Doju: since the code doesn't run locally
 goolmoos: like: python bot_code.py &lt; input.txt
 goolmoos: print the inputs in the ide
 goolmoos: copy from there to a local file
 goolmoos: and then
 Doju: yeah it doesnt work 
 goolmoos: why not?
 Doju: or it does
 Doju: but just as poorly as this method
 Doju: so i didn't even bother
 wlesavo: Quidome it was disscussed earlier, struck even comiled some replays
 Doju: because the ide truncates the strings if they're too long
 goolmoos: okay, thanks
 wlesavo: struct*
 Quidome: ok, i am rereading the rules, it's seems enough, but have to start coding...
 Quidome: doing minmax on 1 turn is probably to much...
 MattSOrme: Do you have to have written your code in java to run it locally? Atm im just making changes and uploading to re-test
 cegprakash: yeah Quidome 5 pacs, 14 possible moves
 Quidome: 10 moves actually but still
 cegprakash: that's 14^5 just for all ur moves
 cegprakash: and if u use minimax 
 Quidome: hm... more work&#160;:)
 cegprakash: u need to do 14^5*14^5
 cegprakash: that's 14^10
 cegprakash: may be u can prune it
 cegprakash: like using a GA
 Quidome: yeah correct, but you inly have max 9 moves witk in that case 1 abbility
 Doju: oo i'm doing a modulo in my get_neighbours
 Doju: that's probably not good
 cegprakash: it's 14 Quidome
 cegprakash: Move1 - 4Move2 - 8Switch - 1Speed - 1
 cegprakash: 14 possible moves in a turn
 Quidome: move 2 = 4, always walls
 Quidome: and with speed 2 you can't use your abillity
 Quidome: because it isn't loaded then
 Quidome: dont't forget stay in you position
 cegprakash: so u never use speed?
 Quidome: of course but IF you can move 2, youre cooldown is not zero
 cegprakash: even if move2 is 4 u need to check all 8 positions 
 cegprakash: so it's still 8
 Quidome: yeah sure, it won't help&#160;:)
 cegprakash: may be we can precompute that
 cegprakash: to keep it at 4
 Quidome: I stay with max 9, same position included, teh 10 was also not right&#160;:(
 njaber: Move2 is up to 6 actually
 Quidome: how?
 thethiny: @ Python users please print debug with flush=True, will save you hours of debugging.
 Quidome: if you can move in 4 directions, it is 9 is it?
 njaber: #0#0#00C00
 cegprakash: I see only 4
 njaber: that's the most possible move 2 you can have at once
 Quidome: that is a 7, because of you can also not walk
 njaber: # are wall, O are paths
 cegprakash: oh wait
 Quidome: nut move 1 position to the left and then start counting
 cegprakash: I see 6
 njaber: I said Move2, not Move1 or Move0
 Peudoki: when you submit, is your previous score meaningless?
 cegprakash: that's right Peudoki

 jrke: whats this quidome
 Quidome: sorry messing around with the pastebin
 jrke: don't spam you will be banned
 Quidome: i don't understand it obviously
 Quidome: sorry
 njaber: How do you force a message to use the pastebin?
 jrke: i can't do anything just moderator can do it
 Quidome: i just pasted it in and that forces the pastebin
 Quidome: i was suprised by that
 njaber: Oh ok

 Jesus_inn_party: oh now get it
 Quidome: njaber did you see my pattern
 cegprakash: Quidome ppl are busy playing with pastebin.. 
 cegprakash: they don't want ur pattern
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: I do though
 njaber: Yes what of it? in that case there is only 4 move2 yes,I just said the max was 6
 cegprakash: okay the point is don't do straightforward minimax
 cegprakash: unless u want to timeout
 cegprakash: do a pruning with a search or GA
 cegprakash: or have a nice pathfinding algorithm
 cegprakash: :D
 cegprakash: I am lazy to do pathfinding algorithm
 cegprakash: so I go with GA
 Quidome: Aha, we were talking different numbers I understand now what you mean
 Quidome: GA?
 cegprakash: Genetic Algorithm
 Quidome: wow, ok
 Quidome: and that is lasy&#160;;)
 njaber: I'm going the good pathfinding/tracking/state evaluation route
 SemChumboPT: Damm i'm almost in 1600, without speed, switch or oponent check&#160;!!
 jrke: i am 1000 with speed switch and opponent check
 cegprakash: we all have noob bots
 cegprakash: less talking go code
 njaber: ^
 MSmits: I think I have a lucky submit
 Doju: aaaaahhh what am i doing
 Doju: i just realized
 Doju: that i've been doing the most expensive calculation in my precalc
 MSmits: all I did was do some performance improvements and increas depth of search =/
 Doju: n^2 too many times
 Doju:&#160;!!!
 SemChumboPT: cegprakash... i need to chat a little, so when i come back to code, i realise some basic thing i missed :D
 kovi: nice submit msmits
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: this bot is lacking a lot though, not sure why it does so well
 Nerchio: :O
 MSmits: 2nd lol
 MSmits: I'm completely surprised by this
 jrke: what was your last rank
 MSmits: around 50
 MSmits: when i finished writing my search
 jrke: :scream:
 jrke: 50th to 2nd
 MSmits: just now I improved performance (3x as many sims)
 MSmits: and increased depth from 6 to 8
 jrke: K
 Doju: rofl
 MSmits: but my pacs still dont see pellets more than 8 turns away
 Doju: i just cut down the time by like 3 fold
 MSmits: I get half a million sims to depth 8
 MSmits: in turn 1
 Doju: wow
 MSmits: about 50k in other turns
 MSmits: glad I switched to c++.
 MSmits: the performance improvement was mostly getting rid of vectors
 MSmits: generating temporary lists hurts
 Csipcsirip_2: do you use the fabulous SmitsiMax algo&#160;? 
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: it's just a monte carlo variant
 MSmits: do random :poop: for 8 turns and see how many pellets you got
 Doju: :D
 kovi: but what about enemy?
 MSmits: i avoid them if they have advantage
 MSmits: so they are impassable objects
 MSmits: thats all
 kovi: sure, but are you simulating them?
 MSmits: i dont even try to kill them
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i am not even trying to keep information and or to discern where they must have travelled and collected pellets
 MSmits: all of that is on my list
 MSmits: if i dont see them, they dont exist
 wlesavo: MSmits nice
 MSmits: it's really a very basic bot still. I have a list of 10 things and I am still working on the priority 1 part
 Csipcsirip_2: wow I'm surpriesed that it's enough to top10
 MSmits: so am I
 jrke: whats your logic
 MSmits: I guess it is mostly a top 10 bot that got to 2 with some luck... but who can say, ratings are close
 MSmits: what do you mean jrke
 MSmits: it's a pretty broad question&#160;:)
 jrke: algo or logic
 MSmits: I use random to find the best paths
 jrke: :slight_smile:
 MSmits: I'm  not going to share what kind of pruning logic I use of course. That would be beyond silly 
 jrke: K
 MSmits: but i dont mind sharing that it is monte carlo
 MSmits: euler already shared this 
 MSmits: also it's the first thing to try
 MSmits: I did try beamsearch before i did monte carlo
 MSmits: It really hurt my head to recursively try all move combinations
 MSmits: I gave up doing that
 AntiSquid: and that didn't do as well? i expected beam search to be better ... 
 AntiSquid: aborting then
 MSmits: i dont know AntiSquid
 MSmits: It just hurt my head
 AntiSquid: how so @_@
 MSmits: also think about what will happen if all pacs are over 5 turns away
 MSmits: from a pellet
 AntiSquid: beam search is just pick best few moves, continue to next step
 MSmits: the beamsearch will record 0 score
 MSmits: so how do you sort and filter?
 AntiSquid: why try recursively&#160;?
 AntiSquid: you just select few candidates that seem to you to be the best
 MSmits: because with 5 pacs there pac_move^5 combinations
 MSmits: each combination is a valid set of moves
 MSmits: or can be
 AntiSquid: and why do you need to go through all of them?
 MSmits: because its beamsearch
 MSmits: beamsearch is essentially a full search every turn, except you sort out the low scoring move combinations
 MSmits: so you need all move combinations
 AntiSquid: nobody is forcing you to do full search&#160;?!
 MSmits: of course not, but if you do a beamsearch and want it to be as good or better than monte carlo, you will have to
 AntiSquid: maybe i thinking of something else, but i don't remember full search being a requirement
 MSmits: ok, lets put it this way. The way i understand beamsearch is like this:
 MSmits: you have x states
 MSmits: you generate all children from them
 MSmits: you sort them by score
 AntiSquid: and select a few . how doesn't matter
 MSmits: and keep the y best ones (for example 1000)
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: sure, ok you dont necessarily have to select by score
 MSmits: but you kinda do want the best ones?
 MSmits: how are you going to know which are best if all pacs need to travel a  few turns
 MSmits: thats my problem
 MSmits: you can do all sorts of eval of course, for example, how far is the nearest pellet. But then you're already losing information
 MSmits: I just feel beamsearch is possible, but too hard for me here. 
 MSmits: I dont need a real eval with monte carlo either. I just get as many pellets as i can&#160;:)
 thethiny: BFS with max depth of 5 is good imo
 thethiny: you only move 2 steps at a time
 MSmits: for a single pac, sure
 MSmits: try to do it for 5 pacs at once
 thethiny: in my code I can go max depth of 25
 MSmits: and them not getting in eachothers way
 thethiny: 5 per each pac
 MSmits: how do you avoid them going for the same pellets?
 thethiny: I put the nodes that I step on into a list
 thethiny: and I return the list
 thethiny: then I check for each i in the list, if both have the same i, then I find another path for it
 MSmits: yeah, you can do stuff like that to mitigate the problem of pacs gettin in eachothers way
 thethiny: as for going for the same pellet
 thethiny: I give a negative value to the pacs
 thethiny: so that it gives them low score to cross here
 thethiny: treat it kind of a "wall"
 MSmits: yeah that will help
 thethiny: ctr_right, seen_r = get_next_iter(x+1, y, ctr, cur_rows, depth, seen=deepcopy(seen))
 thethiny: and return seen
 MSmits: looks complicated&#160;:)
 thethiny: it's just a recursive call
 leojean890: gg MSmits&#160;;)
 MSmits: ah yes, also it's python ofc, no brackets
 MSmits: thanks leojean890
 thethiny:     if cur_rows[y][x].startswith('P'): #Penalty for Being Close to Friend
 thethiny:     if cur_rows[y][x] == ' ':
 thethiny:     if depth &gt;= max_depth:
 thethiny: that's it
 thethiny: then do recursive calls
 MSmits: I think if you're doing python an extensive monte carlo is not really an option, so your way of doing things might be good thethiny
 Doju: I might try monte carlo but with larger steps and some added magic
 RockyMullet: woah big submit MSmits
 RockyMullet: wp
 Riyuk: Well played MSmits!
 MSmits: thanks guys
 RockyMullet: and I won against your submit :D bummped me up a little haha
 MSmits: nice, I am already finding some bugs
 RockyMullet: #1 or nothing&#160;;)
 MSmits: haha, honestly top 10 would be great and otherwise I'll be happy with legend if I can pass gold boss again.
 Jesus_inn_party: again?!
 RockyMullet: me giving that I'm already struggling at staying in the top 50, I'm afraid it might not be enough for gold :CRY:
 MSmits: i mean like in earlier contests...
 Jesus_inn_party: oh sure 
 MSmits: you mean not enough for legend RockyMullet?
 JohnCM: congrats msmits
 RockyMullet: hum yeah I guess im overreacting, it might be enough for gold lol
 RockyMullet: but deffinitly not legend
 RockyMullet: yours should be tho :D
 MSmits: nah its not, not yet
 MSmits: legend is top 15
 MSmits: and the friday top 15 will be stronger than my bot
 MSmits: if i did nothing that is
 RockyMullet: oh yeah obivously, but I know you will :D
 MSmits: It is likely yes. But we'll see
 Illedan: Nice MSmits :D
 cegprakash: lucky MSmits
 cegprakash: I'm coming for ya
 MSmits: thanks Illedan, I was honestly surprised. I still think it might be luck Illedan. I see many bugs
 MSmits: or at  least... some bugs and many features lacking
 RockyMullet: hopefully silver will be &lt; 1000 people, so luck wont be as important
 AntiSquid: ceg you're getting ahead of yourself
 MSmits: I just fixed a bug where it refused to go into dead ends to collect pellets :P
 Illedan: xD
 AntiSquid: #1000 climb few ranks before you threaten MSmits lol
 RockyMullet: the treats are flying
 AntiSquid: ya MSmits still early in the contest, everyone is shitting bugs
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: opponent tracking will be interesting
 MSmits: not because you want to eat them or avoid being eaten by them
 MSmits: but because you want to know which pellets are still up 
 cegprakash: I was looking at this line for 30 minutes what's the issue
 cegprakash: if (int p = 0; p &lt; players[playerId].pacsCnt; p++)
 cegprakash: I'm a crap
 RockyMullet: I have tracking, its as good as "yeah they could be everywhere, good luck"
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MSmits: RockyMullet don't you track "possible pellets"&#160;?
 IAmNoob: can someone help me with hte "Vox codei"?
 MSmits: like, when you have seen before that there was no pellet, you keep it recorded?
 AntiSquid: hm ladder is stupid random atm
 cegprakash: MSmits becomes #2 and u say ladder is stupid
 cegprakash: coincidence or targetted?
 AntiSquid: currently submit at top 50, but same submit was top 200 earlier ... the level of random is annoying
 RockyMullet: MSmits yeah that I do
 MSmits: me too, it is all i track currently
 RockyMullet: probably the most important thing
 Doju: Anybody got a very large and complex map?
 MSmits: yes
 AntiSquid: MSmits i suggest you don't resub in case you think it's just luck, enjoy your rank for longer
 MSmits: i will wait until silver probably
 JohnCM: as long as reach silver whatever rank doesn't matter anymore
 RockyMullet: yeah im olding to a submit for silver too
 JohnCM: i'm wondering if i should resubmit and risk it
 JohnCM: haha
 MSmits: i wonder how many will get to silver
 AntiSquid: i mean this same bot barely got into top 100 earlier, now it's top 50 wtf bs random
 RockyMullet: I hope really bad its under 1k
 JohnCM: well you only get ~70 matches
 cegprakash: I think at least 500 should be promoted
 JohnCM: and given that sometimes you win 60-40 to a person
 MSmits: will they do it by percentage, or by absolute rank. normally it is like top 300-400. But percentage-wise that would now be 800 or so
 AntiSquid: nah let's keep the tradition of 50% :p
 JohnCM: there's some luck
 cegprakash: so that another 1000 will join soon
 Doju: 500 ms precalc in 33*16 map
 MSmits: is it 50%&#160;?
 AntiSquid: ya the cut off for silver
 cegprakash: 50% is too much
 Doju: not bad since there's still some more room
 AntiSquid: is usually that
 MSmits: thats a lot of pac people
 AntiSquid: i am joking and would like to see everyone endure long submits, and so does Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i can help u with that
 Illedan: Damn, Romka is at it -.-
 RockyMullet: our savior
 AntiSquid: submit more bots Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: is it possible to use a for loop
 MSmits: pulling me down too Illedan
 cegprakash: if (int p = 0; p &lt; players[playerId].pacsCnt; p++)
 AntiSquid: best way to do it infinite loop submit new bots Automaton2000 we have a week left
 Automaton2000: honestly, i just about said it based on a board
 cegprakash: and staring it for 30 minutes
 JohnCM: haha the leaderboard is so exciting
 MSmits: gonna get back to coding. HF guys
 JohnCM: good to see that it keeps changing
 AntiSquid: do we reach 3k before silver?
 shashwat986: i'm pretty sure we do
 IAmNoob: when is silver
 IAmNoob: not today?
 shashwat986: 3.5 hours from now?
 IAmNoob: ok
 shashwat986: is that accurate?
 IAmNoob: yeah
 Riyuk: already 2.9k
 AntiSquid: probably half stopped participating anyway?
 AntiSquid: tons of broken / bugged bots in there
 cegprakash: mine is broken + bugged
 RockyMullet: im surprise how many bots still dont go for the big pellets
 Braykin08: I don't specifically tell mine to go for the big pellets. It just happen it's the most rewarding path&#160;:) 
 Doju: RockyMullet it's some work to implement that in a way that makes sense
 RockyMullet: mkay, maybe its just that my bot is dumb and "go there take that big shiny thing" is good enough lol
 Doju: :D
 Doju: i've been thinking of adding them so that
 Doju: if (distance_to_super)/(distance_to_normal) &lt; some_constant
 Doju: then go for the super
 Doju: but i think i should just skip that step and go straight to more advanced things
 Braykin08: I worked with that until the top 250, but changed it since then
 Doju: hm
 Doju: actually you know what?
 Doju: Now that i have my precalc working at least semi-reliably, i could test its robustness by doing that
 Peudoki: I'm ready for Silver
 SemChumboPT: I'm ready too, many players will go to silver and i will go up on bronze&#160;:)
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 Jesus_inn_party: sup noob
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 Jesus_inn_party: are am not so sure they are going to release it today
 IAmNoob: hopefuly
 Doju: How do you organize your movement functions?
 Doju: mine is a horrible mess of ifs and elses
 SemChumboPT: mine are 25  elseif elseif
 IAmNoob: BRUH:)
 eulerscheZahl: generate valid moves, apply them, score outcome
 Doju: SemChumboPT sounds like you need to hear this too :D
 IAmNoob: mine is a main for loop
 Doju: umm i don't really care about scoring the moves
 Doju: just that my logic isn't this messy
 Doju: for example atm mine is looking like this:
 SemChumboPT: I'm ignoring everything...just look for the next pellet end go... no logic involved
 IAmNoob: you wont go in silver
 IAmNoob: if so
 Jesus_inn_party: what rank o you have?
 SemChumboPT: IAmNoob, this way i'm got for sure
 eulerscheZahl: don't share a large chunk of code now Doju
 Scarfield: ^
 SemChumboPT: 1900 ( i was already on 1700, but got 1900 again)
 AntiSquid: ya doju please don't
 eulerscheZahl: where did that MSmits come from? :o
 Doju: i was typing a vague explanation of what my code looks like
 Doju:&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: although it won't make much difference
 Jesus_inn_party: dude are you copy pasting alll your ode here it looks like you are gone for ever
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: we got streamer at around rank 200 things will get intense :p
 Maciulis: anybody seen any impressive hunter bots? seems like a fun alternative
 MSmits: hi eulerscheZahl
 Scarfield: The Netherlands ifaik
 Jesus_inn_party: yo when this silver rank is out?
 IAmNoob: in 2h
 BenjaminUrquhart: 3 hours or so
 IAmNoob: or more
 eulerscheZahl: 2h 45min if it's on time
 IAmNoob: i think it wont be
 Jesus_inn_party: :grimacing:
 BenjaminUrquhart: it probably isn't
 IAmNoob: about 5h
 IAmNoob: or less
 IAmNoob: 4h
 IAmNoob: doint know
 BenjaminUrquhart: also I somehow gained 50 places overnight
 BenjaminUrquhart: kek
 IAmNoob: i lost about 10000
 IAmNoob: 1000*
 IAmNoob: i was 500
 IAmNoob: now 1500
 IAmNoob:&#160;:(
 MSmits: could be a slight improvement from 1500 to 500
 IAmNoob: i dont know
 Jesus_inn_party: there is just one poblem with my code i could find nowmy pacs get stock!
 Jesus_inn_party: *problem
 IAmNoob: yeah
 IAmNoob: but you can try
 IAmNoob: to boost them
 IAmNoob: i dont say how
 IAmNoob: but you will see
 Jesus_inn_party: :cry:
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 IAmNoob: dont worry
 IAmNoob: we all had that problem
 Scarfield: my code has one problem, it loses to many games :p
 SemChumboPT: ^:)
 mesavitae: haha, I can identify with that one
 mesavitae: i think my code's biggest problem is me
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)))
 IAmNoob: my code biggest problem is: i dont know how i want my pac to eat enemyes
 SemChumboPT: I'll start from scratch... be back in one hour!!
 Hjax: MSmits you climbed quickly :O
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: MSmits works hard
 Hjax: meanwhile im here writing silly things that i know im going to scrap 
 Jesus_inn_party: this romka was 300th an hour ago!
 mesavitae: I think eating enemies will be last on my list
 Jesus_inn_party: mine too
 IAmNoob: on mine not
 IAmNoob: i have a solid dfs
 mesavitae: nice
 IAmNoob: and a solid algorithm about eating pellets
 IAmNoob: but still not enaught
 Jesus_inn_party: eating enemies is just a waste of time when there are more pellets to eat
 IAmNoob: enought*
 IAmNoob: but when are pellets
 IAmNoob: far away
 Jesus_inn_party: i am thinking that if there is no pellets visible go to a random place 
 IAmNoob: no no no no
 IAmNoob: not in my case
 Jesus_inn_party: but till now i did not have any problems with unvisible pellets 
 IAmNoob: i too
 IAmNoob: but if you do so
 IAmNoob: your pacs will stuck easy
 Jesus_inn_party: if i solve my pacs stuck a big step will be picked
 IAmNoob: yes
 cegprakash: do we cin twice if one of my pacs is affected by speed?
 Hjax: no cegprakash they move twice towards the last target
 IAmNoob: cout you mean?
 Hjax: your code doesnt run again 
 Hjax: i should check the ref to see how they path if theres two paths of the same length 
 AntiSquid: never too late for a new year's resolution: start reading problem statements
 IAmNoob: the big old problem
 IAmNoob: no visible pellets
 IAmNoob:&#160;:(
 Doju: IAmNoob then guess where they are?
 eulerscheZahl: then go to the invisible ones
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 IAmNoob: nice joke
 Doju: not a joke
 IAmNoob: not you
 eulerscheZahl: we are both serious about it
 IAmNoob: eurler..
 IAmNoob: ok
 IAmNoob: what invisible pellets
 Scarfield: unseen ones..
 eulerscheZahl: at the beginning there's a pellet everywhere
 wlesavo: euler so the actual change of inputs is coming?
 MSmits: except where the pacies are
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i get them when other pac is line of vision
 IAmNoob: ok
 eulerscheZahl: mark those cells that you have seen and that have no pellet
 Doju: good point MSmits
 IAmNoob: good idea
 IAmNoob: thx
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo i don't know more than you
 eulerscheZahl: [CG]ThibaudToday at 2:28 PMWe'll fix a few bugs and introduce a better way to detect dead pacs. It'll come with the Silver league tonight. I'll give more details later
 Illedan: There will be bugs \o/ 
 Doju: ohh that's amazing
 MSmits: ah cool
 MSmits: I love dead pacs
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 Jesus_inn_party: or just make an algorithem for times when no Pellet is invisible
 eulerscheZahl: arena: 25   Pacman: 46   draw: 19i think i'll submit that
 Doju: well yeah, that's called guessing where the next ones are
 Illedan: What is that euler?
 SemChumboPT: It's easy to now it's dead if it's not returned on the loop
 MSmits: he beat his arena version
 MSmits: meaning its an improvement
 Illedan: aha
 MSmits: likely
 eulerscheZahl: and i failed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/sepu9h">https://prnt.sc/sepu9h</a>
 Illedan: Crashing or loses?
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: #Fail
 eulerscheZahl: timeouts
 Illedan: auch
 eulerscheZahl: seems my machine is faster than the CG server
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i set another timeout for offline testing
 MSmits: that makes more sense
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i googled 'Plandemic' and google asked me if i was a robot... tell me the US govt. isn't packet sniffing?
 Hjax: are all the top bots doing some kind of search?
 eulerscheZahl: probably
 MSmits: probably
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 MSmits: lol
 AntiSquid: for loop search
 Hjax: im at rank ~100 with no search, because i havent come up with a search strategy i like yet 
 IAmNoob: wut
 MSmits: it's not easy to do here
 IAmNoob: in bronze?
 Hjax: yes
 MSmits: why not
 Hjax: my bot is just a handful of heuristics lol 
 IAmNoob: you lucky
 MSmits: if you dont use strategies that work in higher leagues, you dont get out of lower leagues 
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 Hjax: lucky? nah 
 IAmNoob: i think so
 eulerscheZahl: oh, my IDE was still in release mode. and I only run the code bundler in debug mode. of course it was timing out :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I thought silver was opening, anyone know when?
 Illedan: IDE in release mode?
 Illedan: PatrickMcGinnisII 18:00
 Illedan: Gmt+
 Illedan: 1
 Illedan: 2 hours~
 IAmNoob: why can't i read the map as a boolean variable
 Hjax: searching imperfect information games is pretty weird 
 Hjax: at least its not something im super familiar with 
 eulerscheZahl: then make assumptions and set them granted for the search
 MSmits: Hjax yea... it's not easy
 Hjax: yeah thats less of a problem than deciding what search algorithm i want to use 
 Doju: IAmNoob that's basically whati'm doing and i'm at rank 871... soooo....
 IAmNoob: any ideas about my question
 MSmits: I found it more natural for ooc, where the imperfect information was the entire object of the search
 Doju: or not booleans but ints but still it's a bad idea if you want to get far
 IAmNoob: for the start
 IAmNoob: i think bool is a good idea
 Doju: well during the first move you have perfect information
 IAmNoob: yes
 IAmNoob: and all the turns
 IAmNoob: you can mark them as eaten
 IAmNoob: in the pacs x nad y
 Doju: you have perfect information of the cells that are visible
 IAmNoob: yes
 IAmNoob: that's what i need
 IAmNoob: i have a problem with the visible pellets
 IAmNoob: so:(
 Doju: i struggled with them for a while too but i'm sure you can make it work
 Scarfield: there are no pellets on the starting positions of the pellets, it seems you are assuming that there is IAmNoob?
 Scarfield: of the pacs*
 IAmNoob: you right
 IAmNoob: but is sill not much trouble
 IAmNoob: still*
 Scarfield: nope, but you wouldnt be able to see if opponent uses abilities in first turn, if you assume there are pellets on the pacs starting pos&#160;:)
 IAmNoob: hmmm
 IAmNoob: yes
 IAmNoob: bad idea:(
 IAmNoob: but still i am not the best of this competitions
 IAmNoob: so i'll give it a try
 Scarfield: sure, IAmNoPro either :p
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 Doju: why is there a huge crane right in front of the window of my apartment ._.
 IAmNoob: ^___^
 Scarfield: watch out for Dwayne Johnson running
 Smartasskilling: In what for statement should I put my sorting?
 duckquackduck: is there any way to print out your current state as JSON when using c#? 
 IAmNoob: Smartasskilling what sorting:)
 Scarfield: are you using StalinSort? its O(n)
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))))
 Smartasskilling: Is the chat in the main website or is it like puzzle chat?
 Scarfield: this is main&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: there is #world and country specific chats like #de #fr #ru in another language
 Smartasskilling: Damn sry. I'm in the easy Temperature puzzle. There's a for statement where the program gives the values of temperatures. Can I sort the inputs in that for statement or should I provide my own for statement. In python btw and I don't know if the inputs make a list or how they are stored
 IAmNoob: you can sort there
 Smartasskilling: Thx
 IAmNoob: np
 ZarthaxX: MSmits WTF
 IAmNoob: keep doing puzzles:)
 MSmits: :scream:
 IAmNoob:&#160;;)
 IAmNoob:&#160;;(
 ZarthaxX: when did you get 4
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: beast
 MSmits: I got 2 a while ago, but Romka kicked me down
 eulerscheZahl: casually sets himself at #4 out of 3700 players
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: strong random search
 MSmits: yeah thats all it is really
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl you dropped that search and now smito proves you wrong
 ZarthaxX: :c
 MSmits: the rest of the bot is pretty basic
 ZarthaxX: thought random would kind of fail finding paths at some point
 ZarthaxX: but i guess it helps giving some sort of collaboration between pacs?
 Doju: is there some logic to the fact that the syntax for union of sets is | and not + in python?
 MSmits: i dont want to get into too much detail, but there's many things you can do with monte carlo to make it better, as euler will tell you
 ZarthaxX: sure
 MSmits: it does help a lot with collaboration yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: Doju google it
 shashwat986: It's | in ruby too
 MSmits: as you consider a combined strategy, not a singular pac strategy
 shashwat986: the concept is UNION = OR from a mathematics perspective
 MSmits: and do suffer from a depth limit still, it's at 8 turns, after that, it wont see pellets
 ZarthaxX: well gz smito
 MSmits: thanks
 IAmNoob: finally i got a solid bot
 IAmNoob: yessss
 MSmits: grats
 Doju: gj, IAmNoob
 ZarthaxX: there is smth i dont get tho
 Cappefra: I think after 8 pellets your eval gets pretty imprecise anyways unless you also have a strong opponent tracking, right?
 MSmits: whats that
 ZarthaxX: i didnt submit in 24hs and i got from like 90 to 29 now
 BenjaminUrquhart: close one MSmits<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461055091">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461055091</a>
 ZarthaxX: we really need more games
 BenjaminUrquhart: ZarthaxX same
 eulerscheZahl: silver is near
 Hjax: MSmits your bot is monte carlo? 
 ZarthaxX: 2 hs toad?
 MSmits: yes hjax
 Cappefra: my bot is conte di monte cristo
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 ZarthaxX: lmao Cappefra
 BenjaminUrquhart: it's because the top people keep resubmitting and I can beat them half the time
 Hjax: im torn between monte carlo, minimax, or some kind of A* pathfinding 
 IAmNoob: i use dfs
 IAmNoob: is easy enought
 tutubalin: my typical game:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Cs0FQ8vfw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Cs0FQ8vfw</a>
 shashwat986: are you guys using monte carlo for time-efficiency?
 ZarthaxX: BenjaminUrquhart randomness is strange
 MSmits: of those 3 only the first will be good if you have a fast language. If not, then A* or bfs or whatever will be better
 MSmits: you need collaboration between pacs
 Hjax: does java count as a fast language :P 
 ZarthaxX: MSmits anyway beware that a dude that was like 7yesterday with same submit ended 130
 IAmNoob: yes
 Hjax: java is like, fastish 
 MSmits: A* wont do that, minimax is not good for this i think
 MSmits: java is fine
 Hjax: probably not "fast"
 MSmits: c++ would be better of course
 IAmNoob: i use c++
 MSmits: my bot simulates 8 turns for all pacs half a million times in turn 1 (with 1 second)
 wlesavo: tutubalin :grinning:
 Hjax: if i end up writing a time sensitive search strategy ill port it to C++ if time becomes an issue 
 Hjax: thats a weekend problem though 
 Hjax: doesnt really matter at this stage
 Peudoki: I still only use 1-2ms per turn, so the 50ms is plenty for now
 MSmits: ZarthaxX I am just happy the search is working and I can focus on smaller details now... I dont mind if it drops back down to 30-50 or something
 Hjax: how many sims do you do on turn 2 MSmits
 ZarthaxX: MSmits good point :P
 MSmits: Hjax, depends on the number of pacs i guess. Between 20-50k
 MSmits: also on the map size and stuff
 MSmits: and the cpu my bot is assigned
 Hjax: do you do entirely random rollouts, or are your pacs biased towards pellets?
 IAmNoob: we are close to 1950
 IAmNoob: 2950*
 MSmits: dont want to give details like that atm. 
 Hjax: ah no problem 
 MSmits: will do full explanation in PM of course
 IAmNoob:&#160;:))
 ZarthaxX: fair
 IAmNoob: as usually
 BenjaminUrquhart: Hjax fyi, you might want to deal with blind collisions at some point<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461147455">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461147455</a>
 MSmits: thats half the fun for me... it's always painful to keep things to myself&#160;:(
 IAmNoob: for me too
 IAmNoob: but i am kina noobish
 Hjax: @BenjaminUrquhart dont take anything my bot does seriously right now lol 
 BenjaminUrquhart: too late :eyes:
 Hjax: my bot does a lot of horrifically bad things 
 ZarthaxX: MSmits keep going then&#160;:)
 uvBoss: im on the verge of extioncion
 ZarthaxX: i have notepad open
 Hjax: it was just some heuristics to make sure i could parse the game state 
 MSmits: will do
 uvBoss: extionction*
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: not with talking no :P
 ZarthaxX: u didnt get it haha
 BenjaminUrquhart: extinction*
 uvBoss: lmaoooo
 uvBoss: @BenjaminUrqhart do u recognize me?
 uvBoss: changed my dp cover and my username
 BenjaminUrquhart: can't tell, I'm not following you
 cegprakash: wait what.. I can't move 1 step when I'm on speed?
 cegprakash: 2 steps are compulsory
 eulerscheZahl: ye can
 Hjax: you can cegprakash
 cegprakash: I can?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 SemChumboPT: if you hit a wall
 eulerscheZahl: you can even move 0 cells
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you specify a space 1 away
 MSmits: you can't reflect from a wall though
 MSmits: you wont pick up a pellet that way
 SemChumboPT: I'm trying one space but he walks 2 anyway
 uvBoss: im the_joker_100 if u wonderin
 Nerchio: wall jumping in this game would be fun
 Nerchio: :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: btw not sure if it was mentioned already: biggest CG contest ever :tada:
 Nerchio: nice
 Peudoki: just download this wallhack.exe Nerchio
 uvBoss: noice
 Scarfield: :metal:
 Nerchio: how do i add msgs to my bot i dont understand this description
 Nerchio: nothing is working
 eulerscheZahl: MOVE id x y text
 goolmoos: after the cmd nerchio
 Nerchio: yeah cant make it work xD
 SemChumboPT: I have dificulties reading the text, it's too dark 
 Jesus_inn_party: guys is the league free or not 
 Scarfield: output it as one string
 eulerscheZahl: do you have messages turned on in the viewer Nerchio?
 Scarfield: MOVE id x y text|MOVE id x y text
 eulerscheZahl: the wheel at the bottom
 cegprakash: okay my sim is wrong for move2
 cegprakash: let me add unit tests for move2
 Nerchio: yeah
 Nerchio: ok it works now
 eulerscheZahl: do you see messages of other players?
 Bastett: I think I'm missing something here. I run a speed boost, but still run half the speed of the other guy.  Idon't see any documentation about levels of speed...
 Nerchio: maybe my bots went some way where they avoided the added statement
 Nerchio: bugs :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 Bastett: his command appears to be SPEED X QS
 Bastett: have I missed something important?
 Hjax: Bastett you need to give a command at least 2 squares away 
 GreatTux: if you have speed boost but give move command to the next tile you move by one
 shashwat986: is it usual for one particular turn to take 46ms, and then, on a rerun take 200ms?
 Hjax: your code doent run twice when you speed
 Bastett: Hjax that would be it
 Bastett: wonderful
 Bastett: thanks&#160;:)
 SemChumboPT: Send: SPEED bot LightSpeed
 SemChumboPT:&#160;:)
 Bastett: I suspect this quick change may bump me up the ranks somewhat
 Doju: Uumm okay
 Doju: my rank just dropped by almost a thousand for absolutely no reason
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Sounds reasonable /s
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Before anyone complains, I’m on my phone and my MUC chat app is broken
 ZarthaxX: benja?
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:E
 Scarfield: that will not stop me from complaining.. grr "rage" grr :p
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:👀
 eulerscheZahl: connect the chat bot with your own account and we won't even notice what you are doing
 Hjax: bronze boss is chosen from the pool of existing bots right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 duckquackduck: hmm, we are not allowed to use Newtonsoft.JSon package for C#? (for spring challenge)
 Hjax: how is that chosen? what rank?
 SemChumboPT: there are bots on the pool?
 eulerscheZahl: jupoulton2 at 731 is a good candidate i think
 SemChumboPT: where's that pool?
 BenWo: morning folks
 eulerscheZahl: the boss will be a bot from the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: CG chooses a rank where they want the boss to be and sets it as boss
 cegprakash: I've never been boss
 Peudoki: from what postition though?
 AntiSquid: top 10
 eulerscheZahl: CG decides how big they want silver
 AntiSquid: it's bronze afterall
 BoBot: aren't there other conditions like being deterministic?
 BoBot: i.e. not using random in the bot
 AntiSquid: yes
 eulerscheZahl: the gold boss will be around rank 10 usually
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:No random and no messages
 cegprakash: u can achieve deterministic with random using seed
 eulerscheZahl: being deterministic is a plus
 cegprakash: and constant no. of sims
 eulerscheZahl: also taking little CPU time
 BoBot: you get what I mean, and I get you&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and short code, as CG takes a quick review
 AntiSquid: BoBot they might pick a random bot actually
 Peudoki: do you think the best codes are already gold worthy?
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: well not worthy
 AntiSquid: but they will promote
 BoBot: people are often annoyed testing against non-deterministic, that is probably the reason
 Nerchio: ofc they are come on :D
 Doju: Oh how did i manage this
 AntiSquid: i expect top 200 and above might reach gold anyway even if they don't improve ... maybe more than that
 BoBot: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763629953">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1763629953</a>
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Imagine improving your bot
 Doju: I don't think i made any changes and now pac 3 is always going off the map
 Hjax: bots get better pretty quickly, i dont think my current bot (rank 91) would reach gold as is 
 AntiSquid: 100% sure it will
 Hjax: i dont think i had any trouble getting gold in unleash the geek, legend took me a little while i think 
 ZeroByter: Silver open yet?
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Hjax how's your UTG "bronze bot"
 Nerchio: first turn what a joke
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461164046">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461164046</a>
 AntiSquid: there's worse nerchio
 Hjax: what do you mean my bronze bot?
 BoBot: well that can be both predicted and countered&#160;:)
 BoBot: not that I have done so :D
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:You said your bot played like a bronze one 😛
 JohnCM: that is true, against monte carlo algo, even if i change my algo, the outcome is non-deterministic
 AntiSquid: if i find replay again i will show it to you, but basically had scissors sitting next to enemy rock in a dead end, all the rock has to do is wait for the scissors to waste the cooldown or risk kill it, but waiting is easier
 Hjax: my final utg bot was pretty good i think 
 Hjax: i did a few clever things 
 NaVin: how to change speed and pac type 
 AntiSquid: so what's your most impressive stunt Hjax&#160;?
 BoBot: but you cannot with certainty eat anyone right? because it is RPS, every move can be countered
 AntiSquid: in utg
 Hjax: tracking my opponents radar cooldowns, since most bots always prioritized a radar over a mine if it was available 
 Hjax: was a nice meta observation that i dont think many others made
 anid: Silver Pacman in 1 hour?
 Hjax: i mention it in my postmortem 
 AntiSquid: you can if the enemy is stuck behind your pac and your pac counters theirs, you can play the waiting game, nobody will do the waiting game as well and then once they wasted their cd, you switch and eat them ... i dunno maybe there's more since there are other pacs
 AntiSquid: bobot
 BoBot: do you know if someone used their CD? 
 Hjax: you can see their cooldown
 Hjax: its given to you 
 BoBot: that information is not given is it? oh, ok :D
 BoBot: did not know that
 Scarfield: for visible pacs, all info about them is given
 BoBot: ok, then I guess it is true, because you cannot switch and move in the same turn
 BoBot: so whoever goes first can still be countered
 AntiSquid: oh yay, found a bug that once fixed drops me 100 ranks :D (80 to 180)
 BoBot: switches first*
 cegprakash: why do I have a code like
 cegprakash: pacMan.pos + dir[move.vec[0]];
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 Doju: That's always fun AntiSquid
 cegprakash: it should be +=
 BoBot: there are actually pretty complex RPS strategies/bots, I tried a bit on this site last year:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.rpscontest.com/leaderboard">http://www.rpscontest.com/leaderboard</a>
 NaVin: AntiSquid can you tell how to change pac speed and pac type
 BoBot: surprisingly high winrates for the top ones
 AntiSquid: yes it's in the statement NaVin
 Riyuk: ceg your code should not even compile with these syntax errors 
 AntiSquid: read the problem statement
 NaVin: I read but don't get idea 
 cegprakash: Riyuk that's no syntax error
 NaVin: Do I need to print SPEED ,pac_id,coordinates
 ZeroByter: no?
 ZeroByter: Just print 'SPEED 2', then on the next turn, move two or more cells away 
 NaVin: thanks
 Riyuk: ceg my bad :D a simple addition
 ZeroByter: Note: U can not move (or do anything) while ur pac is using speed. In general, each pac can only do one thing at a time
 BoBot: I'm a pac with a one track mind...
 RavenKZP: is there any MSG command?
 DomiKo: just do
 DomiKo: MOVE id x y MSG
 Nerchio: silver in 20 min? or 1h20min?
 ZarthaxX: the latter
 Riyuk: 20 mins!
 Quidome: 1:20
 Riyuk:&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: hi guys
 ZeroByter: What's a good method for coming up with strategies? I try playing games, reviewing the replays I lost and correcting mistakes but it doesn't seem to help and actually make things worse sometimes
 AntiSquid: when is silver out?
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Next week
 Quidome: T-1:20
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Clearly
 RavenKZP: &lt;3 nice ty @DomiKo
 DomiKo: no problem @Raven 
 Nerchio: hey antisquid
 Nerchio: do you know when silver is coming out
 Hjax: 1 hour 15 minutes from now nerchio
 Quidome: :P
 jrke: any news about bos
 jrke: s
 AntiSquid: ah only nerchio gets it
 AntiSquid: nerchio i fixed a bug today
 Doju: lol youre still going with that
 AntiSquid: hm maybe i should tell someone else though
 AntiSquid: hey MSmits i fixed a bug
 Doju: euler is online
 AntiSquid: thought i'd let you know
 Counterbalance: I can show you how to fix all your bugs at once AntiSquid
 Nerchio: you fixed a bug?
 Nerchio: only 1000 left :D
 MSmits: thats great AntiSquid
 BenWo: wow 3k in bronze now
 Doju: Counterbalance ctrl+a -&gt; del&#160;?
 Counterbalance: close!  main(){}
 pde-bakk: heyq guys i got a question. is it possible to see how long it takes to finish a function (if that makes sense)?
 DomiKo: any guesses about number of people in silver?
 AntiSquid: need 2 more for that benwoo
 BenWo: I'm a habitual rounder
 AntiSquid: looks like a hack Counterbalance, i don't trust you, you want me to hack the servers
 jrke: hey i can defeat nerchio but still my rank is 785
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461173824">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461173824</a>
 Nerchio: i was debuggig this game just a sec ago lol
 Nerchio: and decided you were just lucky :D
 Adnmaster: if you defeat someone it doesn't mean you will be better than him, you have to win more people than him... jrke
 AntiSquid: jrke maybe he has a premium account, game is rigged towards P2W
 Nerchio: yeah i get double points for winning
 Nerchio: 5$ a month
 ZeroByter: sign me up
 jrke: how to get premium account as i spend only 1 month on codingame
 vtenneke: I dont think premium accounts are a thing&#160;;)
 jrke: look i also defeated euler
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461129964">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461129964</a>
 Nerchio: your bot is insane
 Automaton2000: but i see no way to get into legend
 ZeroByter: i defeated antisquid once on one map :P, but then when i played on different seeds i lost. still felt a little good about myself there
 jrke: whats keyword
 AntiSquid: any word
 AntiSquid: just type some words and Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: 90% of the time though
 jrke: any word
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:I can defeat everyone on occasion except illedan
 MSmits: hey, nice improvement AntiSquid
 Illedan: Unless you try my current bot
 AntiSquid: you didn't ping Automaton2000 jrke
 Automaton2000: would you have to write the same code
 AntiSquid: MSmits not really lol
 avdg: we fail forwards?
 AntiSquid: had this rank since yesterday, done a few changes, fixed a bug and then dropped 100 ranks, undid the bug and resubmitted
 Nerchio: lol
 Jesus_inn_party: sup ewery bodeeeee!
 AntiSquid: now i am thinking how to use this special bug as in my scoring function
 MSmits: ohh ok
 Jesus_inn_party: guys the league is not still out?
 Maciulis: 1 more hour
 avdg: bug abuse :p
 avdg: jk
 AntiSquid: Jesus_inn_party should know when silver comes out :thinking:
 jrke: what can i do to be lucky
 AntiSquid: i mean it's jesus
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:They way my bug fixes work is they fix the bug but don’t improve my overall score
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:So it’s like "why did I bother"
 jrke: dbdr you have time out
 Jesus_inn_party:  am not sure that people that are holding the competition know themselves
 jrke: look <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461183961">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461183961</a>
 BenWo: _creepersbane - hard to improve the bot when you don't understand why it's behaving a certain way, that's why
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Also, it’s doing so well I’m afraid to touch it
 avdg: currently I'm only nuding my internal scoring system :p
 avdg: *nudging
 CodinBotChatRelay: _creepersbane#2074:Unfortunate typo
 avdg: wow my computer is that slow it didn't pick up keys
 JohnCM: haha. i resubmitted the same algo and got 100 places lower. so yep pretty random leaderboard ranking now
 avdg: mine goes up and down
 JohnCM: quite sure if i resubmit again it will fluctuate. so just gonna wait for silver
 avdg: but mostly top 800
 JohnCM: sounds good:)
 AntiSquid: it always fluctuates
 JohnCM: after getting inspired by MSmits I think I should do a heuristic-based monte carlo algo
 JohnCM: gonna reprogram from scratch tmr
 jrke: why this 2 win against euler 1 against nericho and 1 against dbdr but my rank 782
 MichaelVonWolfen: when is Silver opening?
 MSmits: good luck JohnCM
 JohnCM: thanks MSmits! but i shall see if python can make it
 JohnCM: maybe need to switch language
 MSmits: ouch python... will be hard, you'll get 5k sims at turn 1 at the most I think, if you do it carefully
 JohnCM: hmm.. then maybe C++
 MSmits: you should, if you're confortable coding in that
 MSmits: I am not btw... but still getting better&#160;:)
 JohnCM: my ultimate tic tac toe bot I only could run 10 iterations with python
 MSmits: yea ok, so no python then&#160;:)
 JohnCM: so i think probably won't work
 ZarthaxX: that's a ton!
 ZarthaxX: you can do a lot with 10 sims
 H1ggsb0s0n: I see two guys in top 10 are using Python, so it should be possible to rank high with Python
 Illedan: 10 sims :D
 Nerchio: you can take the closest pellet with 10 sims
 MSmits: H1ggsb0s0n right now...
 ZarthaxX: wait for last day H1ggsb0s0n
 JohnCM: i can take closest pellet with 1 sim
 ZarthaxX: JohnCM thats huge!
 Doju: Illedan imagine the possibilities
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461189040">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461189040</a>
 JohnCM: lol.. it is either move there or don't move
 jrke: this isn't my luck
 JohnCM: anyway that was meant to be a joke
 jrke: what can i do my rank sucks
 ZarthaxX: JohnCM i know it was, it's sad&#160;:(
 Doju: i've sunk like 200 ranks in half an hour
 JohnCM: haha oh well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pde-bakk did u get an answer for your question?  There are different clock functions for timing depending on your language, and you can always send the result to the error log
 Doju: people must be submitting their bots before silver opens
 mesavitae: anyone mind answering a few questions about applying an algorithm? 
 jrke: what mesavitae
 pde-bakk: @PatrickMcGinnisll Yeah I found some time stuff in ruby so I can keep track of it. Thanks man!
 dbdr: jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/FAQ">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/FAQ</a>
 jrke: K dbdr
 Illedan: :sob:
 dbdr: let's celebrate our new FAQ page&#160;:)
 avdg: anyone could write that :P
 dbdr: that's the idea
 avdg: there goes my trust&#160;;-)
 josegomez: anyone know why if I have boost on and so does openonent I get skipped a round?
 avdg: rounds gets added on speed boost
 josegomez: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jcg.pictures/gdhcWggihagfUgc.png">https://jcg.pictures/gdhcWggihagfUgc.png</a>
 avdg: not sure about mechanic
 josegomez: we both did speed boost, but then he gets an extra turn
 Scarfield: you need to target a cell 2 moves away, otherwise you only move one cell
 josegomez: ah! thanks!
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 avdg: meh :p
 AntiSquid: rust new meta
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: silver league started?
 AntiSquid:&#160;:/
 Hjax: i dont think silver is open yet, looks like they are testing something? 
 AntiSquid: me and Automaton2000 are in silver
 Hjax: i see Maxime in silver
 Automaton2000: i made it to legend
 AntiSquid: oh nvm then
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: but maxime has 0 score
 dbdr: you need to cheat to get to silver
 Hjax: theres no one else in silver for maxime to play against 
 Hjax: so yeah, 0 rating lol 
 Doju: how does that bot give such context-aware reponses? :o
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: that's beyond science
 Riyuk: looks like they are preparing the opening of silver
 Doju: aaaa i gotta finish this thing quick D:
 AntiSquid: 45 minutes left afaik
 AntiSquid: or they start early because they want to promote 1000 
 AntiSquid: :D
 H1ggsb0s0n: how do we make it to silver&#160;? Do we need to resubmit the code or will the top x% be promoted&#160;?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: we have to beat default ai to get silver?
 AntiSquid: no don't resubmit
 Hjax: you dont have to do anything H1ggsb0s0n
 Riyuk: it's automatic
 Hjax: just wait, it will promote people automatically 
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: on what basis?
 AntiSquid: you need stable rank and be in the upper half of bronze to get promoted H1ggsb0s0n
 H1ggsb0s0n: ty
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i have to jump 300 ranks damn
 AntiSquid: it's roughly 50% 
 AntiSquid: not exactly .
 AntiSquid: maybe less&#160;?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yeah that jump is also rough estimate
 Riyuk: could be less, could be more :D
 AntiSquid: def not more :D
 H1ggsb0s0n: Is the promotion a one time thing&#160;? Can one make it into silver if they missed their chance the first time&#160;?
 avdg: very exciting place :p
 MSmits: H1ggsb0s0n yes
 MSmits: its often easier to make it later
 AntiSquid: you can promote anytime before contest ends
 Hjax: depends on who the bronze boss is 
 MSmits: except on gold boss
 Hjax: oh i missed some scrolling 
 avdg: so when will gold open?
 Hjax: gold will open wednesday 
 Hjax: legend will open friday 
 Hjax: iirc
 ZarthaxX: ye
 TheBigFatFlamingo: hi
 Doju: hi
 TheBigFatFlamingo: im new
 TheBigFatFlamingo: is it fun&#160;?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yeah
 Doju: Very fun
 BenWo: hi
 BenWo: it is fun
 karliso: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7c4add9d-19c9-4bfb-b54c-17460362a9bd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7c4add9d-19c9-4bfb-b54c-17460362a9bd</a>
 TheBigFatFlamingo: is somewhat easy? haha
 BenWo: the beginning is easy
 TheBigFatFlamingo: oh ok
 MSmits: you're right karliso
 MSmits: it's not a perfect description
 TheBigFatFlamingo: whats after the tutorial?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: everything is easy with right knowledge and hard work
 MSmits: it should be described as separate turns, with two eating phases
 karliso: MSmits oh, ok.
 H1ggsb0s0n: karliso, check step 5 above: Repeat for any pac with an activated SPEED ability.
 BenWo: TheBigFatFlamingo - most of us are working on the Spring Challenge
 MSmits: ah yes
 karliso: H1ggsb0s0n yes, but it is how collisions are resolved.
 TheBigFatFlamingo: whats with the profile pic? 
 TheBigFatFlamingo: can i change it?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: yes
 TheBigFatFlamingo: how?
 BenjaminUrquhart: your profile
 BenWo: top right menu &gt; profile
 BenjaminUrquhart: [CG]Maxime stop hacking kthx
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: go to your profile page
 kovi: he is already silver
 eulerscheZahl: how does it feel to be #2 again kovi?
 avdg: hmm added a tweak to prevent my bot from sending far destinations
 avdg: not sure if I should deploy now
 TheBigFatFlamingo: got it
 Riyuk: eulerscheZahl you know more than him about this feeling :p
 eulerscheZahl: :cry:
 TheBigFatFlamingo: whats after the tutorial lol?
 BenjaminUrquhart: stuff
 TheBigFatFlamingo: wow
 avdg: too late
 TheBigFatFlamingo: can you learn coading from this?
 BenjaminUrquhart: kind of
 TheBigFatFlamingo: sorry for all these questions
 avdg: everyone has to learn
 TheBigFatFlamingo: yeah im doing a class and i want to have some kind of base
 TheBigFatFlamingo: sorry for my english also
 Doju: TheBigFatFlamingo to be honest I think coding under a time limit teaches you to write sloppy code
 H1ggsb0s0n: unfortunately this has almost anything to do with production quality code
 TheBigFatFlamingo: its timed?
 Doju: well, clashes have a time limit
 Doju: and the spring challenge ends in 6 days
 TheBigFatFlamingo: oh..ok
 TheBigFatFlamingo: well cya later
 TheBigFatFlamingo: imma try to sole something
 Doju: alrghty, cya
 BenWo: there are tons of non-timed exercises on the site too
 BenWo: gl
 Kellthazar: submit a new changes aborts the previous one, right?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: [CG]Maxime stopped hacking
 AntiSquid: yes but 20 minutes left till silver i wouldn't submit anything now
 avdg: in the worst case, you can grab your previous version from history
 avdg: and meh I'm fine, 1300th and climbing
 Kellthazar: Im controlling my changes locally with git
 AntiSquid: i think i found a way to get rid of my bug without losing ranks, but won't submit now to check
 BenjaminUrquhart: 75 people computing smh
 BenjaminUrquhart: eulerscheZahl what happened to you
 Quidome: What is the 'standard' amount or percentage promoting to gold
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok
 eulerscheZahl: just a few timeouts, no big deal
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 eulerscheZahl: scoring is expensive
 AntiSquid: 25% probably Quidome
 cegprakash: what does it mean if my unit test is passing but prediction does not :O
 Quidome: ok, thnxs
 Kellthazar: My death avoidance code was checking all the cells out of the range of threat except the one that he's just sitting at the moment... hahahaha
 AntiSquid: top 25% of silver
 eulerscheZahl: jupoulton at 811 now. i bet that will be the boss
 eulerscheZahl: but why is maxime submitting? way too high
 avdg: I will soon be higher than 800
 AntiSquid: early gold :p
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud also has a good position for a boss at 650 i think
 ZarthaxX: the 350 is that bad?
 AntiSquid: you think the cut off will be that high&#160;?
 Crypticsy: hey the game broke , 235 frames<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461215058">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461215058</a>
 Hjax: is the boss always a CG account?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: but for lower leagues the odds are good
 avdg: someone was speeding?
 Peudoki: 200 rounds, so could be more than 200 frames
 dbdr: I hope they don't recompute silver, that would be a lot...
 AntiSquid: oh they changed it&#160;! hah&#160;!
 AntiSquid: no more loss by frame-out
 BenjaminUrquhart: dew it, let the world burl
 BenjaminUrquhart: burn
 Hjax: thibaud has a starcraft profile picture, so i approve
 AntiSquid: you can't outframe the opponent
 dbdr: sth on the forum?
 avdg: well, they don't look too much at github anyway... my pr is still as deserted as before
 TheBigFatFlamingo: how am i soppused to sole the Thor level if they didnt even tell me what to do?
 TheBigFatFlamingo: supposed 
 Quidome: Uh, so it is 200 turns now instead of frames?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 BenjaminUrquhart: not like most games last that long anyway
 dbdr: where are the changes documented?
 dbdr: no recent commit on github
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait for league opening
 avdg: maybe they didn't push to github
 wlesavo: 74 computing :slight_smile:
 dbdr: &gt; We'll fix a few bugs and introduce a better way to detect dead pacs. It'll come with the Silver league tonight. I'll give more details later
 dbdr: what Thibault said on discord
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 avdg: *doesn't track discord
 Csipcsirip_2: niiice
 Kellthazar: Rank 343...
 dbdr: I'm ambivalent on the change, makes sense, but I already worked on trying to detect dead opponents
 Hasan-35: hi
 eulerscheZahl: exactly my opinion
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahlYesterday at 10:59 AMand while it's still relatively early in the game, it's always annoying to those who already wrote code to deal with the problem of missing information
 dbdr: not critical, and probably some of it will still be useful, but still, questionable
 dbdr: no big deal anyway, there is still time&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and some were warned about the possible change
 dbdr: ah, missed that
 BenjaminUrquhart: what will come first, aps starting or silver
 dbdr: the 200 frames, I did not even notice
 eulerscheZahl: Neumann brought it up on the moderators channel on discord
 dbdr: what about the crossing pacs I read about?
 dbdr: is this a bug or a feature?
 eulerscheZahl: so i knew about it yesterday morning already. a little unfair
 dbdr: if someone has a replay, btw...
 anid: No git updates yet?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/commits/master">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2020/commits/master</a>
 anid: Not for Silver right?
 eulerscheZahl: that's just a mirror of the private referee repo i suppose
 Kellthazar: What changed?
 eulerscheZahl: so there might be some changes, just not reflected in the public one
 eulerscheZahl: so far nothing changed. but i expect dead pacmen in the input
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahlYesterday at 9:53 AMi think the only way not to break bots is to have 2 protocols and allow the user to turn it onlike MOVE 0 7 10 | PROTOCOL2
 BenjaminUrquhart: I assume they're given negative coordinates
 eulerscheZahl: let's see if they follow my advice
 dbdr: without breaking existing bots, by the way?
 dbdr: looks reasonable
 dbdr: BenjaminUrquhart that can break existing bots
 Kellthazar: But we already have this information...
 dbdr: very hard no to
 BenjaminUrquhart: dbdr I know
 dbdr: MOVE 0 7 10 | PROTOCOL_SECRET_SHOW_ALL_PACS&#160;;)
 kovi: silver
 BenjaminUrquhart: silver
 eulerscheZahl: damn
 eulerscheZahl: i'm submitting
 BenjaminUrquhart: got frozen at 00
 eulerscheZahl: oh, finished just in time
 NormantasStankevicius: SUBMITTING!
 BenjaminUrquhart: ey
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: is gane of 300 frames
 Dav1dS: kovi is still bronze on my end
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i just got one
 BenjaminUrquhart: k my bot crashed
 ZarthaxX: ded server
 eulerscheZahl: only 200 to silver :o
 BenjaminUrquhart: InvalidArgumentException
 Cappefra: woooot
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl what a cut
 Doju: wow
 Cappefra: 200? wtf
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 dbdr: &gt;  typeId: the pac's type (ROCK or PAPER or SCISSORS ). If the pac is dead, its type is now DEAD. 
 Nerchio: i am in the middle of submit come on haha
 Cappefra: that's an op bronze bot
 dbdr: CG always overeacts
 dbdr: gold will be big, legend will be tiny
 NormantasStankevicius: What are the preferences of pac to go when compared north east west south? when getting closer the a pellet I want?
 dbdr: since bronze huge and silver small
 eulerscheZahl: i thought they would be gentle this time with so many new players
 NormantasStankevicius: North &gt; east &gt; south &gt; west?
 aCat: oh now i see
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0f9d6df5-0c93-41d2-81b3-33f60ceb3a26">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0f9d6df5-0c93-41d2-81b3-33f60ceb3a26</a>
 MindControler: If enemy pack is dead it is visible always now?
 dbdr: type DEAD
 kovi: broke bot then
 ZarthaxX: that's why the timeouts?
 eulerscheZahl: typeId: the pac's type (ROCK or PAPER or SCISSORS). If the pac is dead, its type is now DEAD.
 Hjax: oh that crashes me LUL 
 kovi: oh well, no testing this time
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, my bot is broken too now
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: here my 220 game
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461228570">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461228570</a>
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i am not joking
 BenWo: sweet, added 150 lines of code and my bot is exactly as crappy :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm trying to move a dead pacman of my own
 Cappefra: wait but... If the bot was mine I could already detect that it was dead cause well, it's not there anymore
 JohnCM: yay made it to silver
 avdg: my ai survived the bot, but the bot is muh higher than me
 Cappefra: so is that input meant for bots that I just ate?
 penguinblaze: when you have 231 long game"something's wrong i can feel it"
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: same
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: 220 long
 AntiSquid: made it to silver, close call
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: another one had 300
 Peudoki: are dead pacs globally visible?
 avdg: no
 anid: So they took 200 to silver
 avdg: you should detect the lack of them yourself
 AntiSquid: lol woot only top 200 silver? :D
 Cappefra: that's not even 7% cutoff wtf
 avdg: mine easily beats the bot but I am at rank 400 now
 Nerchio: people will push the bot some more just wait
 uvBoss: :sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob::sob:
 Riyuk: I guess it's not over yet
 Riyuk: only 200 fo now
 kovi: resubmit
 AntiSquid: oh so maybe 200 at a time to not kill the server completely&#160;? keep it in a half dead state
 NormantasStankevicius: I assume legend will have like 4 people
 eulerscheZahl: they didn't even resubmit?
 eulerscheZahl: just move us up
 njaber: So what's the deal with dead pacs? Do we get them logged?
 AntiSquid: that's cool imo
 eulerscheZahl: i see no progress circles
 AntiSquid: i prefer instant move than resub
 eulerscheZahl: oh, 20 games for the whole submit
 avdg: I wonder if the bot was given a high score at the start
 eulerscheZahl: that's even less than bronze, come on
 dbf: only 20 games in silver
 kovi: :o
 eulerscheZahl: 10 actually
 eulerscheZahl: the other 10 are from other players fighting against you
 josegomez: anyone know of a way to battle a specific player you follow/
 kovi: well, maybe its ok because of dead
 mesavitae: in the players tab, you can delete the bot and pcik who you want
 Quidome: delete the boss
 dbdr: maybe only for the initial run?
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, but these games affect my rating?
 Peudoki: I was hoping more games in silver, not less
 [CG]Thibaud: there will be more
 Peudoki: nice
 [CG]Thibaud: after the opening is complete
 dbf: cool, thanks
 Hjax: ok unbroke my bot 
 dbdr: nice hack :D
 Hjax: crashed every game where an enemy died lol 
 Cappefra: I think I'm missing something about the dead bots thing
 Riyuk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f0748e8-ba93-4702-bd50-f1b338df4ad2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f0748e8-ba93-4702-bd50-f1b338df4ad2</a>
 KRAKEN: I sent a lost game(which ended in 10 frame so obviously an error from my side) to my IDE, but when I run it from IDE it works and I win, any idea?!?!!??!
 JohnCM: ya now i need to skip the input phase if the type_id is "DEAD"
 JohnCM: minor change to code
 MindControler: Well got my reason to rewrite the code
 Peudoki: wait for the server lag to calm down
 avdg: check the codingame faq to check the software its running
 avdg: it might be different
 Cappefra: but why was the change made? I don't get the use of this input
 avdg: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Nerchio: i dont want a better job cg..
 Cappefra: @nerchio lol
 Nerchio: just want to be in silver
 aCat: you always see opponent dead bots now?
 anid: Does anyone else have continuous timeouts now?
 MindControler: There is new type "DEAD"
 avdg: there might be higher stress on the servers at times like this
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: me
 anid: Ohh thanks @MindControler
 Cappefra: my battles are not timing out
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: just submitted and my ass is getting wooped
 njaber: I don't get the "DEAD" type on any pac tho
 RoboStac: you aren't in silver
 RoboStac: so you won't
 njaber: Oh it's in silver only
 avdg: bumped some places while fighting other bots :D
 avdg: still 360 in front of me
 Peudoki: I like this change about dead pacs
 MindControler: Peudoki yea super helpful
 Nerchio: will be fun to finally see decent games from the start of the submit
 Nerchio: instead of after 30 games
 anid: What good does seeing a dead pac do?
 anid: other than timeouts :P
 avdg: ai panicking about dead pacs
 Vintarel: I have no clue what it could be useful for :p
 MindControler: Anid knowing u dont nee to kill  it second time
 Dav1dS: the new dead pacs will break my code if i get to silver
 Hjax: it was kind of annoying to track if an enemy pac was dead before, in some situations you wouldnt even know you killed someone (if you walked around a corner and instantly killed them)
 avdg: and (hopefullly not) crashes
 anid: Wouldnt have happened anyway&#160;:/
 Vintarel: instead of seeing pac yelling "i have more pacs than you"
 MindControler: Anid or u dont need to be safe from it
 anid: maybe the top guys like kovi and MSmits will find a use for it
 kovi: already did
 anid:&#160;:) kove
 anid: *kovi
 avdg: 300 more for me
 avdg: oh cool, we can track dead pacs now
 anid: For now Im settling for avoiding timeout
 avdg: and yes probably breaks my bot
 KRAKEN: now I can command my pac to give 1 frame silence for dead pacs&#160;:(
 BenWo: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: fixed crashing, let's see how badly this goes
 Quidome: Yes! Silver!
 Tiramon: oh silver has opened, i already wondered why my last submit was soooo good
 Cappefra: ok so resubmitting was a mistake
 Cappefra: shit
 mesavitae: ugh top 40 in bronze so close
 wlesavo: my crashing was from trying to switch to the dead type, i guess it worked
 kovi: now many gam,es
 shashwat986: Quick question: Do I see all dead pacs? Or just the visibly dead pacs
 dbdr: thanks kovi
 MoMaT: you don't see the deads. it's not 6th sense :P
 MindControler: shashwat986 I think all
 icecream17: did gold open?
 hearthewarsong: You cant kill someone without seeing him
 icecream17: yes. wow
 icecream17: oops *silver
 Vintarel: yep it opened 25 minutes ago
 kovi: you can
 kovi: you can kill and die
 kovi: so you cant see
 shashwat986: That's a very bleak point of view, kovi :D
 wlesavo: and you get the deads every turn
 wlesavo: even the old ones
 tobk: is league promotion already finished? 300 seems awfully few (compared to 2700 remaining in bronze)
 shashwat986: cool, thankns
 wlesavo: so they hunt you in a way :slight_smile:
 MattSOrme: kovi almost back on top
 wlesavo: i mean haunt
 Riyuk: his bot is consistent
 tobk: huh, new rules in silver? that's new.
 kovi: interesting meta change here
 dbdr: in what way livi?
 BigBadDictator_2fe3: hi
 dbdr: kovi sry :D
 Waffle3z: had to update my code since it didn't understand dead pacs can't interact with anything
 wlesavo: im doing surprisingly well
 dbdr: some players are still crashing, mist likely..
 wlesavo: is it gonna be 100 games?
 dbdr: the good ones, actually
 dbdr: not crashing on unexpected input is sloppy
 Waffle3z: only if you're expecting unexpected input
 wlesavo: lol, im also crashing, just find a replay, thought i fixed everything
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2773bf45-b24e-476b-a42b-ef3f95c0131c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2773bf45-b24e-476b-a42b-ef3f95c0131c</a>
 dbdr: I don't see how you could not crash in a reasonable way
 eulerscheZahl: for me everything that isn't rock or paper is scissors
 eulerscheZahl: so i tried to move my own dead players and avoid dead opponents
 dbdr: sloppy, as I said&#160;;)
 wlesavo: oh, i think aggressive strat is more favourable in longer games, that could be it
 Waffle3z: I probably was crashing whenever I got close to a dead pac to check its type, resubmitted with a fix and went from 90th to 15th
 eulerscheZahl: it seemed reasonable back then
 dbdr: noob&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm only on CG for a little less than 4 years, how should i see that coming?
 aCat: :D
 Waffle3z: is it normal for rules to change after bronze
 eulerscheZahl: a lot of players submitting fixes right now
 SemChumboPT: DEAD type really exists?
 wlesavo: at least you didnt try to switch to the dead type euler
 <b>**dbdr 's hobby is to call CG old timers noobs whenever it's midly relevant</b></p><p><img src="/a/44107002020442" /> Peudoki: pro strat, type switch your dead pacs
 dbdr: :D
 struct: the "dead" thing is only on silver+?
 eulerscheZahl: Waffle3z it's not normal but happened before
 dbdr: RESUCITATE 0
 Peudoki: yes
 Kukiss: Hello, as I understand some logic about dead pacs have changed recently?Any place where I can read the details?
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. at code4life the molecules count was reduced from 6 to 5
 Peudoki: when you make it to silver
 aCat: Waffle3z nope, they usually try to avoid that
 aCat: but it happens
 dbdr: inb4 more questions in the chat, forever
 dbdr: sad they didn't follow eulerscheZahl's suggestion
 eulerscheZahl: MagusYesterday at 10:59 AMthe only way to not break any code is what euler said&#160;: gives a way to active a new protocol version. But it's kind of messy and complicated in my opinion.
 dbdr: wait
 eulerscheZahl: while broken bots are perfectly normal it seems :P
 dbdr: you could give a bigger map, with a disconnected part, where dead players are teleported
 dbdr: call it heaven or hell, as you like
 wlesavo: damn, cant reproduce the crash
 eulerscheZahl: random opponent?
 dbdr: that should not break good bots
 wlesavo: random number of simulations( 
 eulerscheZahl: seeding!
 wlesavo: even against illedan's deterministic bot
 shashwat986: So, honestly, how much difference is this new information making to your strategies?
 eulerscheZahl: and setting a fixed sim count that you only change for the final submit
 eulerscheZahl: i'm above kovi, something is still broken
 Cappefra: shashwat986 at the moment it's zero difference for me
 dbdr: why change the seed eulerscheZahl?
 avdg: my ai assumes all opponents are kinda bad and some interesting
 kovi: jirotech beating me
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, i dropped a lot the second i wrote it
 AntiSquid: this ranking just confuses me
 Cappefra: other than I'm adding a check for type&#160;!= DEAD when adding the pac to a player
 eulerscheZahl: i mean not having a fixed sim count at the end
 eulerscheZahl: but checking the time
 dbdr: ah ok
 wlesavo: euler same
 dbdr: that means a weaker bot though
 Hasan-35: is there anyone can help me about c#&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: just ask the question and skip the smalltalk Hasan-35
 dbdr: and sometimes hard to find the right count, if sim time depends on inputs, like map size
 SemChumboPT: I'm going up Bronze league...&#160;:) every body is going to silver&#160;:)
 Cappefra: well semchumbo, we were expecting 40% to 50% cutoff and we are at about 13% haha
 dbdr: silver opened at 200, now already 350&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: 372
 Cappefra: yeah I'm waiting for my letter to hogwarts any moment now
 avdg: it's worse than group immunity
 Tib2020: people will still switch between bronze and silver, right?
 Cappefra: I'm 14 bronze
 eulerscheZahl: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have reclaimed my place
 Cappefra: No Tib, when you enter in a league you can't go back
 Nanosplitter: I don't think you can get demoted
 BenjaminUrquhart: nope
 Tib2020: oh, so when does promotion end?&#160;:)
 Tiramon: new information?
 Beerus: i think i got silver too easily
 Peudoki: promotion never ends
 eulerscheZahl: dead players
 Tiramon: did they change something in silver?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Jesus_inn_party: what is new in silver league
 avdg: silver is open, deads are passed as typeId DEAD
 avdg: nothing changes in silver
 eulerscheZahl: you are probably crashing now
 Tiramon: that wasn't done for some time
 dbdr: ROCK beats DEAD
 Tiramon: not in silver yet
 avdg: sim will change though
 avdg: for all ranks
 Peudoki: I lost so many positions by going to silver
 Tiramon: just trying to implement save kills and next to avoid suicide
 eulerscheZahl: kills are fun
 Tiramon: was always disappointing when the S was running away infront of a P
 dbdr: by the way, does your paper kill your own rock?
 wlesavo: тщ
 wlesavo: no
 Peudoki: no
 Cappefra: no dbdr your pacs only bump into each other
 Quidome: no 
 dbdr: ok, thx
 gan3i: I was at 700+ in broze then 300+ moved to silver now I am still in 700+ in bronze, what the hell is happening.
 Tiramon: bots improved ...
 gan3i: my bot lost it's my I guess.
 struct: So they promoted under 10% of bots?
 eulerscheZahl: 380 is &gt; 10%
 Beerus: what about opponents pacs that died?
 Beerus: i visibility count there?
 struct: but it wasnt 10% on start was it?
 eulerscheZahl: dead pacs are always visible
 ashikujjaman: How can I avoid collission in wood league
 eulerscheZahl: no matter who the owner is or where the corpse is
 avdg: reading the map?
 Cappefra: THERE WE GO
 eulerscheZahl: i'm in the same league as Cappefra :scream:quick, open gold!
 MattSOrme: Has round count increased for everyone? Looks like i hit a 300 round game?
 BenjaminUrquhart: PANIC
 MattSOrme: but im still bronze
 eulerscheZahl: oooh, screenshot time :D
 Cappefra: eulerscheZahl hahahaha what did I ever do to you!
 BenjaminUrquhart: MattSOrme they fixed the 200 frame bug
 avdg: there is speedboost adding frames
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a troll, don't worry Cappefra :P
 BenjaminUrquhart: all hail hypno toad
 avdg: it's all an illusion
 Nerchio: my bot tried to counter DEAD pacs
 BenjaminUrquhart: one of these days I'm going to actually make a euler shrine 
 Cappefra: ooof battles in silver are harder haha nice
 kovi: nerchio: mine did the same
 BenjaminUrquhart: duh :P
 eulerscheZahl: my bot tried to MOVE dead pacs
 IAmNoob: hello:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: mine tried to deference null pointer on dead pacs
 Cappefra: eulerscheZahl is your bot's name jesus?
 avdg: hmm not sure if I should submit my updated bot or should see how my current bot breaks
 avdg: it's not fatal though
 avdg: but the influence
 eulerscheZahl: wow a shrine. nice BenjaminUrquhart
 eulerscheZahl: for those who don't understand: he promised to draw some sprites for the Onitama game
 FallenHero1: Dang this chat is going off
 avdg: still 222 in front of me
 AntiSquid: can i trust the rankings at all?
 avdg: not atm
 struct: ranking are a  lie
 BenjaminUrquhart: not until people fix their bots
 struct: i am rank 4000 but should be rank 1
 BenjaminUrquhart: struct pls
 avdg: you know what he said&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: struct and account delete plans if you won't get the rank you want?
 AntiSquid: 3761 bots in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: biggest CG contest ever!
 Beerus: im 270 without tracker and eating or avoid eating strategy
 struct: I havent even started coding yet&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: probably can beat the accountant despite the inflated numbers?
 avdg: current rank, or rank before bot came in?
 eulerscheZahl: definitely possible
 dbdr: bring back the old contest CP rule&#160;;)
 Peudoki: I'm slowly getting back my rank finally
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: nah i still prefer the new one, with decay, keep people active
 eulerscheZahl: you have decay when contests get bigger every time
 struct: If I delete account I cant complete yinsh
 AntiSquid: ah but there's no guarantee this happens again euler
 AntiSquid: maybe it's back to 2k next time
 eulerscheZahl: that implies you plan to complete yinsh one day?
 shashwat986: Can I play the bronze boss? Just for kicks?
 struct: I was planning to do it after the contest
 AntiSquid: ofc
 RockyMullet: you can now see pacs that have died :O:O:O
 RockyMullet: nice
 struct: only on silver RockyMullet
 eulerscheZahl: rocky is in silver
 RockyMullet: :smirk:
 RockyMullet: oof 83th
 AntiSquid: who would've thought /s
 Waffle3z: do dead pacs still have line of sight
 eulerscheZahl: no
 BenjaminUrquhart: no hacks
 eulerscheZahl: just see it as a comment
 RockyMullet: time for the submit I was holding
 eulerscheZahl: telling you that you killed your opponent
 shashwat986: oh crap. that's another change I need to make
 dbdr: dead pacs don't see
 dbdr: but they are seen
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Men_Don%27t_Wear_Plaid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Men_Don%27t_Wear_Plaid</a>
 struct: They are seen from everywher right?
 struct: liike a big pellet
 MSmits: ok but wont my bot think the dead pac is in the way&gt;
 MSmits:&#160;?
 struct: If you dont fix your code probably
 struct: if("DEAD") { x = 0, y = 0}
 struct: easy fix
 eulerscheZahl: now he's busy for the next 30min :D
 RockyMullet: hopefully when the multiplayer comes out, it will be know to all leagues
 MSmits: yeah, i need to go all the way through my code to see where this could cause problems&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: for each input line:
 struct: Dont think it will happen
 struct: It would break many bots rocky
 struct: and now contests are released as soon as contest end
 MSmits: i'll do something like that i guess Euler
 RockyMullet: oh yeah right, they changed that
 MSmits: The position the pac has is the position where it died?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Nanosplitter: my bot is hanging on a line that is just input()
 eulerscheZahl: flash
 eulerscheZahl: flush
 MSmits: allright
 Nanosplitter: It's when it is reading in the board
 Nanosplitter: What do you mean by flush?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/python3-buffering-causes-confusion/181353/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/python3-buffering-causes-confusion/181353/</a>
 DamianS: wait, what happened to the line of sight rule?
 vishalrranjan: hello&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: it remained unchanged
 vishalrranjan: i'm new to bot challenge.
 vishalrranjan: and i know js
 vishalrranjan: how can i do that&#160;?
 Nanosplitter: I can run in the same conditions with just a while True: print(input()) and everything looks fine
 FallenHero1: I'm still learning C#
 vishalrranjan: good
 Nanosplitter: But in my real code it is hanging when it should read the last line of the board
 Nanosplitter: Where it should just read a whole line of "#"s
 AntiSquid: euler new #1?
 eulerscheZahl: i felt like i was underrated in bronze. but i don't think that i should be that high
 eulerscheZahl: i also added a notable improvement this afternoon
 RockyMullet: initial ranking is always chaotic
 Derthek: can you go down in league if you deploy something stupid?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 shashwat986: phew XD
 Derthek: great :D
 eulerscheZahl: RockyMullet most players at the top resubmitted after league opening (with DEAD fix)
 RockyMullet: bottom of high league are where the broken bots go to sleep
 BenjaminUrquhart: illedan :thinking:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461299884">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461299884</a>
 Nanosplitter: eulerscheZahl calling sys.stdout.flush() doesn't help it at all
 eulerscheZahl: you shall flush stderr&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: to show you that you get all input and fail somewhere else
 Nanosplitter: sys.stderr.flush() doesn't help either
 avdg: maybe I'm gonna submit mine again instead of waiting
 eulerscheZahl: then you have to create a new account
 BenjaminUrquhart: pull a struct
 wlesavo: also earlier submits were easier to climb, now most people fixed their deads
 MoMaT: in Python3, to see the output for sure, use: print("xxx", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Quidome: are these changes also affecting bronze?
 BenjaminUrquhart: no
 IAmNoob: if your pac is ROCK if you change it to ROCK it will breake the code or the programm will ignore it?
 Nanosplitter: Ayyy that solved my problem, thank you so much MoMaT
 Nanosplitter: Why did that work though?
 IAmNoob: anyone at my question
 MindControler: Just try it
 MoMaT: Nanosplitter, you might have been calling sys.stderr.flush too late before, at a line that was never reached due to some bug on the way.
 Nanosplitter: weird, thank you
 dbdr: try SWITCH 0 DEAD too
 avdg: lol
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 MindControler: dbdr :D
 dbdr: also switch a dad player back to life
 dbdr: dead
 IAmNoob:&#160;?
 IAmNoob: bruh
 MSmits: freudian slip. I think dbdr became a dad
 eulerscheZahl: is that acutally possible, reincarnation?
 dbdr: lol
 Tiramon: ok in theory less suicide, in reality more timeouts
 BenjaminUrquhart: sounds legit
 dbdr: SWITCH 0 1
 dbdr: to switch the position of your bots
 BenjaminUrquhart: what would be the point though
 njaber: Speed jumping
 dbdr: different kinds
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 njaber: Would be OP
 codefreak288: hii
 codefreak288: how r u all
 codefreak288: hows the lockdown?
 Nerchio: im surrounded by pacs
 BenjaminUrquhart: what lockdown
 njaber: I code 20h a day with or without lockdown so....
 IAmNoob: i too bruh
 Abhishek_Saini: Hey GuysOne clarification about the new information in silver. So when an enemy pac dies, We will receive that information only in the next turn or in all subsequent turns&#160;?
 Thiesjoo: I resubmitted my code(Bronze) from rank 200, there was a bug, so I restored the old code, and now i'm rank 600
 Thiesjoo: What's going on
 avdg: I guess spamming is not wanted
 MSmits: Thiesjoo 2 reasons
 avdg: so very likely once
 icecream17: your old code is worse than a bug
 MSmits: first of all, there is always some luck involved
 BenjaminUrquhart: Abhishek_Saini every turn
 MSmits: but also, bots improve pretty fast 
 Quidome: Thiesjoo you are still caclculating
 Abhishek_Saini: Thanks Benjamin, are you certain about that&#160;?
 avdg: Msmits's bot isn't luck anymore&#160;;-)
 Quidome: wait until finished
 MSmits: ah yes, if your submit isnt finished, then you'll have to wait
 Thiesjoo: 92% and still rank 600
 MSmits:  i don't know what my bot is atm, the change messed it up  a bit
 MSmits: hope i fixed that
 MSmits: Thiesjoo, i didnt know you were ranked so high at 200
 MSmits: pretty good
 Thiesjoo: I was 600 and then everyone went to silver
 Waffle3z: has anyone refuted the idea of a bot that only plays offensively, planning traps and ignoring pellets
 Thiesjoo: Now i goofed and am 600 again
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: hard to say what the reason is
 Doju: Waffle3z i entertained that idea in my head
 Thiesjoo: Will look later, gotta make some homework for tomorrow
 Doju: for maybe 5 seconds until i realized i can't do it
 MindControler: Thiesjoo it also could be that the bug was "feature"
 MSmits: yep homework &gt; all&#160;:)
 icecream17: looking at classroom...
 Tiramon: oh my god .. i added more output, and now i know everything good my bot did was mostly luck ... what a mess
 Abhishek_Saini: Yeah same as Doju , But I thought that for 5 minutes :D 
 Doju: But who knows, maybe it's the meta in 2 days
 Abhishek_Saini: Yeah may be 
 eulerscheZahl: printing 2 lines per turn Tiramon? :D
 Abhishek_Saini: But major cavet is, no matter what you plan, in the end there can be some last second switch from enemy and everything in bin
 Doju: Sigh. I feel so lost in my own code
 Doju: i want to rewrite everything
 Doju: and everything is so messy
 BenjaminUrquhart: I wanted to fix something in a replay versus msmits and now it's obsolete smh
 Waffle3z: enemy ability cooldown is visible, you can tell if they're able to switch and be more careful
 Tiramon: no something is completly wrong with my pellet list
 MSmits: my bot is not deterministic anyway BenjaminUrquhart, it woul dbe a different game
 BenjaminUrquhart: mine is though and that's the most important part
 BenjaminUrquhart: I just don't know how much your actions will change mine
 eulerscheZahl: obsolete just means an older version. you can still play against it
 shashwat986: you can? How?
 eulerscheZahl: and you can always hardcode the opponent if it's random
 eulerscheZahl: i know i linked it a couple of times already...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/460472631">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/460472631</a>
 Doju: Like i'm getting rekt by the bronze boss
 Doju: whose is it btw?
 Doju: any guesses?
 IAmNoob: i killed him a couples of times but i kinda destroyed my code :grimacing:
 IAmNoob: can anyone help me who is a c++ developer
 Doju: I think once i get my fancy math going i'm gonna climb a lot
 Doju: but i might need to restructure everything again before i do that
 Tiramon: ok pellets is right ... then something else must be wrong ... thats not the nearest pellet
 Doju: IAmNoob how long has it taken you to code your bot?
 IAmNoob: about 10-15h
 IAmNoob: you?
 PiterYeh: Bad command: Invalid Input: Expected MOVE &lt;id&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; or SPEED &lt;id&gt; or SWITCH &lt;id&gt; &lt;type(ROCK|PAPER|SCISSORS)&gt; but got 'SWITCH 0 DEAD'
 Doju: oh dear god
 Doju: i'm at like
 Doju: umm how long has this contest been running again?
 PiterYeh: we can't pretend to be dead, or come back from death&#160;:(
 BenWo: lol, how long has the challenge been open?
 BenjaminUrquhart: PiterYeh well that's one way to suicide
 BenjaminUrquhart: um
 Doju: maybe 60-70 hours
 BenjaminUrquhart: just over 4 days I believe
 Doju: ok not then
 avdg: the survival game :p
 Doju: then umm... 50ish
 BenWo: (16*days) hours
 PiterYeh: i don't understand the point of receiving the list of dead pacs
 PiterYeh: am i missing something?
 IAmNoob: i was like in top 50(bronze) but now 1769:(
 BenjaminUrquhart: PiterYeh to avoid confusion
 avdg: you can have blind collisions
 avdg: without that list, your ai can go around a corner, kill an opponent and never know about it
 SemChumboPT: changed from scratch and score is the same
 avdg: goes the other way around as well
 Doju: I have a list that i want to split in half. Is it better to slice the list twice or slice once and substract the first half from the original?
 PiterYeh: ahhh right, didn't think about that
 BenWo: only guessing, but i'd think slice twice
 Doju: yeah and now that i think about it you can't even substract lists
 Doju: so slicing it is :D

 BenWo: :thumbsup:
 BenjaminUrquhart: MSmits your bot is too undeterministic to test reeeeee

 IAmNoob: how can you detect if 2 of your pac are stuck on the same pellet?
 BenjaminUrquhart: they don't move after you tell them to
 Derthek: How do you develop a non deterministic bot?
 icecream17: (prevx prevy) = (x y)
 BenjaminUrquhart: the easy solution is to not send 2 pacs to the same pellet
 RockyMullet: MSmits you broke something ^
 icecream17: randomness
 RockyMullet:&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: Derthek random
 MSmits: not sure RockyMullet
 Derthek: yeah, but why
 avdg: if there was only a way to make randomness deterministic&#160;;-)
 IAmNoob: BenjaminUrquhart i send 2 pacs on the nearest pellet
 RockyMullet: i mean, you were 2nd and now 300th, something is wrong lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: well don't then
 IAmNoob: and if they are near the pellet will be identically
 Doju: [a, b, c, d]&#160;??? [a, b] -&gt; [c, d] is basically what i wanted but dont worry about it, i got it done by slicing AntiSquid
 MSmits: i am not 300th lol... thats resubmitting. I end up around 20-30 now
 MSmits: thats why i am not sure
 LadislavZigo: lool
 Doju: i'd have to convert them to sets and get the difference like in your link 
 Doju: but slicing is fine
 RockyMullet: hu, weird, the leaderboard must be bugged then
 BenjaminUrquhart: friendly reminder that the leaderboard is probably not accurate
 MSmits: my bot dies from stupid :poop: a lot
 MSmits: my pacs I mean
 eulerscheZahl: same MSmits
 shashwat986: Yeah, I started around rank 50 in my first submit, and people are slowly fixing their bots now
 BenjaminUrquhart: Hjax I see you've improved
 RockyMullet: oh now I see it, there little circle showing you not stabilized wasnt showing
 BenjaminUrquhart: stop eating my pacs
 shashwat986: so, my rank is slipping to where i'd expect it to go
 Doju: my bot dies from basically everything that could threaten it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl mine will go down a corridor with an advantaged pac chasing it, goes around the corner, then thinks: Hey, why am I even running? Let's go back, there be pellets!
 Doju: :Dd
 Hvosten: why I have 281 rounds :D
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)))
 Hjax: BenjaminUrquhart i havent done much actually 
 Hjax: just lucky 
 BenjaminUrquhart: ah
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like my bot
 BenjaminUrquhart: story of my life
 Hjax: you at least have search euler 
 IAmNoob:&#160;:)))
 Hjax: maybe ill write search today lol 
 IAmNoob: why some rounds the pacs are moving slow?
 BenjaminUrquhart: speed
 eulerscheZahl: i think a search is a must-have
 IAmNoob: olk
 MSmits: yes
 Hjax: i agree its a must have, im just being wishy washy about how i want to do it 
 IAmNoob: eulerscheZahl why your very hard problem is for only 50 xp?
 Hjax: i should just write monte carlo and be done with it for a while 
 BenjaminUrquhart: so, should I switch from bfs to A*
 BenjaminUrquhart: that is the question
 MSmits: why would A* be better?
 eulerscheZahl: community puzzles always give 50xp only&#160;:/
 Waffle3z: you have enough time to do BFS in the first turn
 Hjax: i precompute all distances, the n^2 bfs only takes like 90 ms 
 IAmNoob: eulerscheZahl  why:((
 MSmits: Waffle3z you cant take into account obstacles that way
 MSmits: like opponent pacs
 BenjaminUrquhart: eh nvm
 eulerscheZahl: also creating a puzzle always gives 250xp. no matter if it's a nicely done puzzle/mulitplayer game or a clash of code
 BenjaminUrquhart: I was thinking of something but I realized it's unnecessary
 IAmNoob: the puzzles dont worth
 eulerscheZahl: those who solved it did it for the joy of solving, not for the XP obviously
 eulerscheZahl: 50XP for that is a joke
 IAmNoob: yes
 MSmits: or for learning/practice
 IAmNoob: but i am interested in level now
 IAmNoob: MSmits  yes
 MSmits: before my first contest I sought out all the pathfinding puzzles to practice for it
 BenjaminUrquhart: why spend time getting fake levels when you can get real experience 
 MSmits: then it turned out I couldnt use any of it on that contest
 Hjax: MSmits i never fail to take a game off of you on your way up, makes me laugh 
 eulerscheZahl: oh nice. Robo solved space maze. even with python
 IAmNoob: BenjaminUrquhart  yes
 Doju: Oh no...
 Hjax: your bot is much better than mine 
 MSmits: but you beat me anyway?
 MSmits: by killing my pacs?
 Doju: my bfs from every cell is too slow ._.
 Hjax: i win about half vs you i think
 MSmits: ah ok
 Hjax: by killing your pacs
 MSmits: my bot is good at not having my pacs compete with eachother
 MSmits: that doesnt help much when many di
 MSmits: +e
 BenjaminUrquhart: e
 eulerscheZahl: i'm here
 eulerscheZahl: you summoned 2.718281828...?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 AntiSquid: are ranks still inflated from the bug&#160;?
 Doju: oh gosh this is taking a while
 AntiSquid: i mean from the change
 Doju: like
 Doju: a looong while..
 solaimanope: ranking needs now around 15 more games to be calculated
 icecream17: everytime i submit, the next day ceg is 50 places above me
 AntiSquid: i am so confused by my bot, is it really that high or just luck or just getting boosted by the broken bots?&#160;:/
 MadKnight: what's value of a pellet&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: then set another player as a target icecream17
 MadKnight: what values can there be&#160;?
 icecream17: target?
 eulerscheZahl: the one you want to beat
 Tiramon: pff .. i think i solved my timeout problem
 eulerscheZahl: java streams?
 Tiramon: no distances calculated with blocking pacs and without and hoping to get the same result
 Tiramon: result was a stackoverflow
 MadKnight: what's max map size&#160;?
 Tiramon: damn there are still timeouts
 RockyMullet: MadKnight pellet can be either 1 or 10
 MadKnight: nothing in between&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: read the constraints at the bottom MadKnight
 RockyMullet: no
 Tiramon: 29 ≤ width ≤ 3510 ≤ height ≤ 17
 Doju: My BFS queue just ran 500000 times locally
 Doju: there maaaay be a slight infinite loop somewhere _D
 Doju: :D
 MadKnight: how does visibility work? do i see everything in 4 directions?
 Doju: yup
 Doju: like everything up until walls
 Jesus_inn_party: are you at silver dojo
 Doju: most definitely not
 Doju: i've been chasing some silly bugs for the past few hours now in hopes of moving in a slightly less dumb way
 Doju: once i get it working i think i have a chance
 Tiramon: ok ... interesting ... my bot breaks without any output, and i definitly always create some output in the begining
 KRAKEN: same here&#160;:( timeouts
 icecream17: Of course the shortest path to the bottom of the screen is by going up. Whyyyyyy do these things happen to me
 dbf: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://c2n.me/47sytFq">https://c2n.me/47sytFq</a> - I would like to have such result with another toad, lol&#160;:)
 MSmits: it's an imfrogstor
 Tiramon: reading all fields took 3s ... i understand why that is a timeout ... but why does it happen
 MSmits: read all inputs, then start timing
 Tiramon: ok you are right took 2ms and quite some time more to start up java
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461363242">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461363242</a>  this is what monte carlo looks like when there are no pellets to get.
 MSmits: check at the end
 MSmits: sorry, the pacs above are doing some icky stuff, NSFW
 Doju: so you're basically picking the "best" paths from some random actions
 MSmits: yes
 Doju: and there isn't really a best
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: just for the kissing pac that is
 eulerscheZahl: dbf you're welcome <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461365244">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461365244</a>
 MSmits: he wants the pellet
 Doju: why don't the others go help?
 MSmits: thats not part of my search
 Doju: okay
 dbf: thanks, eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 ashikujjaman:  I can't avoid if two pac's are getting locked each othermeans two pac are going to cross each other
 dbf: 1 more toad to defeat
 Tiramon: ok no idea why, but all games i start on seed 4338306531561051100 i die initializing
 Doju: noo that can
 Tiramon: no problem with other seeds
 Doju: cant be... my function which just loops through all cells and sets their parent to None
 Doju: is taking the majority of the time in the precompute
 MSmits: I think it's an interesting problem, what to do about the corner death issue
 MSmits: you can pretty reliably estimate there could be an opponent coming arond
 MSmits: around
 BenWo: woo, new submit actually improved :D
 MSmits: but it's gonna cost you if you're wrong
 Waffle3z: I know everywhere an opponent might be but I don't consider where they probably should be so it just looks like they're everywhere
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: so you just floodfilled from last known location?
 Waffle3z: if I were avoiding corner death then I would just never go around corners
 Waffle3z: yeah floodfill 2 spaces and if I see them it resets, and I eliminate spaces I can see
 MSmits: you can do better than that if you take into account speed duration and cooldown
 MSmits: but it gets complicated
 Hjax: probably worth putting a lot of time into though 
 MSmits: its one of the hardest things imho... the fact that you have to deal with the 1 move and 2 move possibility
 Waffle3z: also 0 move
 MSmits: yeah i guess so
 MSmits: its a bit confusing to see sometimes whether a move is a 2nd or a 1st part of  a turn when everyone is speeding
 Hjax: you can do lots of fancy stuff with seeing pellets on the ground too 
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: working on that
 Hjax: MSmits you are a teacher right? are you just home with infinite bot making time? 
 MSmits: not entirely, I have something else every day this week, but mostly it is 2-3 hrs
 MSmits: I have 2 college classes (where i am the student) and 3 classes I teach
 eulerscheZahl: 2-3h something else or 2-3h codingame?
 MSmits: 2-3hr something else 
 eulerscheZahl: sounds great
 MSmits: i worked hard getting everything done before contest started
 eulerscheZahl: and how do you like the game so far?
 MSmits:  I did 2 months worth of assignments for my AI class in 4 days :P
 Hjax: meanwhile i can just watch my rank slowly drop while i work my shift :D 
 MSmits: i like it ok... not a big fan of the unknown info, but i am handling it
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized that you aren't from Europe Hjax
 Hjax: i am not, i am american 
 MSmits: my sympathies on your current situation then
 RockyMullet: the NA life, watch europeens have fun while we work :cry:
 MSmits: pretty horrifying&#160;:(
 Hjax: it hasnt really impacted my area too hard yet, but the country is a mess 
 MSmits: yeah, I mean the combination of politics, economics and disease
 MSmits: all of it together
 eulerscheZahl: Trump says you are doing great, isn't he?
 Hjax: yeah its just going to "go away" it will be "like magic"
 MSmits: as long as you take a big gulp of bleach, all your problems will go away
 Hjax: sunburn the inside of your lungs while you are at it 
 avdg: for those interested in virology there is 1 great place in new york: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/profvrr">https://www.youtube.com/user/profvrr</a>
 MSmits: new york and great place are normally well put together. Not in these times though...
 MSmits: 1 in 10 of people in tha world that died lived in NY
 MSmits: died from covid
 Hjax: california shut down way faster than new york, and they are a lot better off because of it 
 MSmits: it's crazy
 Hjax: i live in connecticut, one state away from new york, a lot of people that work in the city live here 
 MSmits: ah. thats a small state isnt it?
 Hjax: yeah, very tiny 
 MSmits: still get 2 senators :P
 MSmits: crazy system
 avdg: will trump be able to cheat the system again?
 MSmits: he didnt actually cheat the system. System is just broken
 Hjax: yeah he played by the rules, the rules just suck 
 Waffle3z: you can also kill the virus with a gun <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yUE9pQ3zPk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yUE9pQ3zPk</a>
 Tiramon: hm not the best time for a resubmit ... i was at 85% and above the boss ...
 mesavitae: couldn't be a good politician if you don't know how to cheat the system
 MSmits: also, I think you're committing a fallacy when you're saying trump happened because of the electorate. You're still left explaining why *nearly* half of the US thought he would be  a good idea
 dbdr: Tiramon noob&#160;;)
 avdg: not enough soap used
 Kellthazar: The covid tragedy in Brazil its worse every day... The grandmother of a co-worker has COVID and she cant be attended on the hospital because there is no rooms to her.
 Hjax: the media has a lot of power over voters 
 Hjax: and they can say whatever they want 
 MSmits: unfortunately yeah
 AntiSquid: i don't understand US politics, why did people cheer when economical issues arose due to corona virus and say oh it's good we can blame trump 
 MSmits: noone cheered because of that I think
 MSmits: or at least not any majority of people
 Hjax: because trump had historically used the economy to justify all of his other actions, people didnt really cheer, it was more of a "told ya so"
 AntiSquid: lots of people cheered MSmits
 pmor: I haven't really seen anyone cheering because of that
 MSmits: at worst you can see it is a silver lining that he loses one of his goto lines about how great of a job hes doing
 Hjax: yeah exactly MSmits
 MSmits: thats not cheering though
 AntiSquid: lots of news headlines: "democrats cheering on recession"
 MSmits: rightwing news probably
 MSmits: thats how things work these days
 cegprakash: can I get different ID for same bot in different turns?
 pmor: that's plausible...rightwing media demonizes the democrats
 cegprakash: I mean same pac
 Waffle3z: pacId doesn't change
 MSmits: and even if not... news headlines are designed to draw people in
 BenjaminUrquhart: Tiramon that seed has a wrap with no walls in it
 MSmits: they dont have to be nuanced
 BenjaminUrquhart: x = 33 has no walls
 BenjaminUrquhart: sorry
 BenjaminUrquhart: y = 5
 AntiSquid: i doubt it was rightwing, the article also had that mischief happy undertone
 cegprakash: can a pacman's id change during the game?
 Tiramon: oh thx i check that
 BenjaminUrquhart: I don't think so
 BenjaminUrquhart: yeah that's what caused my first timeout
 BenjaminUrquhart: infinite looping
 pmor: It sounds like media bias...No one I know has been cheering
 AntiSquid: i guess it's bias
 pmor: Even those that really dislike the Trump
 AntiSquid: hard to tell, i don't live there, all i get is media, biased or otherwise
 MSmits: read the guardian
 MSmits: I think astrobytes is right about that
 Tiramon: at least i fixed my timeouts
 avdg: hey, lets spend time to make the world better
 pmor: there is right now a lot of contention between those that want to open back up and those that still want to hunker down
 eulerscheZahl: this one MSmits? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://django-guardian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">https://django-guardian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</a>
 AntiSquid: but it comes across as if whatever trump does the democrats just want the opposite, i get it he isn't bright, but why is it always as if they just want to contradict him 
 pmor: that's driven primarily by economic vs safety 
 Hjax: opening up would be a disaster 
 avdg: don't pretend thing will go worse when it will only become worse by talking about evil stuff
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.theguardian.com/">https://www.theguardian.com/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i'm trolling&#160;:/
 Hjax: the loss of human life would far outweigh the economic benefits of opening businesses imo 
 MSmits: I know, me too&#160;:)
 BenjaminUrquhart: euler had the right one
 Tiramon: hm map of that seed changed ...
 eulerscheZahl: impossible
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461382308">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461382308</a>
 BenjaminUrquhart: with that seed
 MSmits: Hjax, it is a false comparsion people are making. You can't choose between economy and health. If  people go to work and massively get sick, it takes longer before the economy starts running again
 Tiramon: oops added a - somehow
 Hjax: yeah, you also dont know how people are going to react, everyone might be too scared to go to the businesses that are reopened 
 pmor: true, but it's the comparison a lot of people are making
 pmor: there are also a lot of people in severe financial hardship
 MSmits: yea, the weaknesses of the US majority view of social security is really apparently
 MSmits: apparent
 Tiramon: i don't see any 'no walls' BenjaminUrquhart
 MSmits: in Europe these things go much better, even with many more deaths and cases per capita
 MSmits: at least in my country
 pmor: Europe in general has much better social programs than the US
 avdg: I guess money is too valuable for the rich in the us
 MSmits: they dont realize that if the country collapses all of their money is worthless
 Tiramon: oh now i know what you mean ... yes that might be a reason when calcing LOS
 pmor: The masses could change that, but the media convinces them otherwise
 MSmits: yep
 BenjaminUrquhart: loooooop
 MSmits: anyway, back to coding&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: hm, my line of sight might be buggy too :o
 pmor:&#160;:)
 MSmits: did you have the infinite sight?
 Tiramon: ok another timeout fixed&#160;;)
 MSmits: someone posted a seed on discord
 MattSOrme: erm, i've got a bug where im getting the pellets, and the last one never seems to return the pellet?
 eulerscheZahl: checking if deltax+deltay = BFS dist and deltax*deltay=0
 MSmits: with a corridor accross the map horizontally
 Tiramon: MSmits 4338306531561051100
 Tiramon: it broke my bot and i had no idea why
 MSmits: yeah mine timed out on that seed
 MattSOrme: i go into the loop, print i, then call input, then print i again, and the second i never prints but only on the final one
 MSmits: but i put a max on iterations
 MSmits: width/2
 BenjaminUrquhart: MattSOrme python?
 MattSOrme: yeah
 BenjaminUrquhart: print(stuff, flush=True)
 Tiramon: ok now i survive the init on that map
 BenjaminUrquhart: for standard error: sys.stderr.flush()
 Yamatan: Hi all =) Does somebody know what is the max size of the map&#160;?)
 MattSOrme: sorry, what does that do?
 Tiramon: it' sin the constraints at the bottom of the text
 eulerscheZahl: makes sure you print everything and don't just buffer MattSOrme
 BenWo: hah, good test seed
 BenjaminUrquhart: seed=-7826971533994987500
 BenWo: recursion depth exceeded
 Yamatan: duck ... thanks, I missed it.
 BenjaminUrquhart: the "original" infinite sight seed
 Hjax: now that you mention it, i think my sight cant see around loops in the map 
 Tiramon: for me the other one was the original&#160;;)
 Tiramon: oh great before the resubmit i was above the bos snow at 12 ...
 BenjaminUrquhart: Tiramon just a warning, your submitted bot crashes in silver
 MattSOrme: hmm, still not sure what that flush is meant to be fixing, i'm having to add it to each successive print, and its still not telling me where my timeout it
 MattSOrme: is*
 Tiramon: no already fixed that without reaching silver&#160;;)
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool
 MattSOrme: the bug comes up and goes away as i change maps, but is constant on the same maps&#160;:/ 
 Thiesjoo: How can you take wrapping into account with manhattan distance?
 eulerscheZahl: wrong question, manhattan already is the wrong approach with all the walls
 Thiesjoo: I know, but is there a quick fix?
 Csipcsirip_2: hm is this intented or a bug. look at the last frames
 Csipcsirip_2: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461397774">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461397774</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but: min(dx, width-1-dx)
 cegprakash: I had a continue inside a switch inside a for loop
 cegprakash: would it case issue?
 shashwat986: I don't agree eulerscheZahl. manhattan is good enough to at least come in top 1k in bronze
 shashwat986: imho
 cegprakash: I changed switch case to if else and it's working fine..
 MindControler: Wait 1st guy doesnt even change his pacs type?
 cegprakash: is it okay to use continue inside switch?
 MindControler: Wow
 eulerscheZahl: maybe we just have different goals then
 Thiesjoo: It is enough to become rank 441 at least
 shashwat986: XD
 MattSOrme: looks like he stood still and ate rock, then changed to scissors and ate paper. 
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl is it okay to use continue inside a switch case
 eulerscheZahl: why do you ask me? am i the coding police?
 eulerscheZahl: AntiSquid heeelp
 cegprakash: MadKnight..
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl no c++ legend
 cegprakash: u are
 eulerscheZahl: check the smash the code leaderboard
 MadKnight: what are u saying cegprakash i can't understand u
 eulerscheZahl: no one does
 cegprakash: can we use continue inside a switch
 cegprakash: like I want the loop outside the switch to continue
 aCat: then yes
 aCat: switch is just a fancy if
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=c%2B%2B+continue+inside+switch">https://lmgtfy.com/?q=c%2B%2B+continue+inside+switch</a>
 aCat: if you have loop outside you can continue
 AntiSquid: eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i still get random people asking me instead of asking the whole chat as a total&#160;:(
 Hjax: how does it feel to be famous euler 
 MonZtaDeluxe: hey eulersche - how ya doin
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not famous. just sitting in my room and not going to work for a month already
 MonZtaDeluxe: nvm - just trollin (ich troll nur)
 MattSOrme: just putting print(flush=True) after my input() seems to have fixed it for some reason&#160;:/ 
 eulerscheZahl: i even gave up on shaving
 ZarthaxX: bearded toad?
 AntiSquid: add "babeh" at the end to make it more edgy MonZtaDeluxe
 eulerscheZahl: wow MonZtaDeluxe you are back :o
 eulerscheZahl: that must have been ages, coders of the carribbean isn't it?
 MonZtaDeluxe: ya man - nope code4life
 MonZtaDeluxe: or the game with wonder womain or something
 eulerscheZahl: close enough
 MattSOrme: hmm, but now my printouts to send my commands isn't working&#160;:/
 Doju: Oh huh. If you do it bug-free, you can actually precalculate all the distances in a timely manner
 AntiSquid: what language?
 AntiSquid: MattSOrme
 Doju: believe it or not, even in python
 MattSOrme: python
 Doju: oh hey
 Doju: if you want to print something but not have it act as a command, do print("something", path=sys.stderr)
 MattSOrme: im doing print(something, file=sys.stderr)
 Doju: oh sorry
 Doju: i meant file
 Doju: yeah
 Doju: okay then i can't help you

 solaimanope: there are some agressive bots in the range 70-90&#160;:(
 Tiramon: 0.36 behind the boss ... 
 eulerscheZahl: just wait
 eulerscheZahl: or improve your bot
 Thiesjoo: YES, finally fixed my BFS. 1 typo and I did not notice until now. Enemy detection just wasn't working. That;'s why I was rank 400
 Doju: nice
 Doju: isn't it a satisfying feeling when you finally find it?
 Thiesjoo: YES
 avdg: luckily it wasn't production&#160;;-)
 MonZtaDeluxe: sorry i'm not good in Bot coding, why is BFS used here? o.O
 Thiesjoo: I use it for finding enemy's in my path
 Thiesjoo: Still using manhattan distance for distance
 Tiramon: there still must be something wrong in my target pellet finding ...my bot prefers the super pellet further away ...
 Hjax: i use it to find distance between my pacs and pellets 
 Doju: MonZtaDeluxe it's handy for getting the true distance between any given cells
 avdg: just to exhaust neighbour searching
 Doju: or for flooding the map and returning a cell if it matches some criteria
 Doju: (eg. pellets)
 MonZtaDeluxe: yeah i was thinking more about flood fill, but right now i think BFS also makes sense - my fault
 dbf: were there any changes in last battles window recently - I see games are played, but my rank is not changed in scoreboard on the right
 dbf:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it's just slower at updating
 dbf: ah, ok
 dbdr: silver grew from 200 to 480 in a few hours
 avdg: hmm still no github push 
 Thiesjoo: I am closing in on silver, few more bugs to fix
 Doju: What's the proper way to deal with missing values?
 Doju: i have a division where either the numerator or denominator can be missing
 Doju: and if either is missing just return the other
 Doju: is the proper way actually just a bunch of ifs and elses?
 Hjax: thats some funky math you are doing 
 dbdr: there is no way to answer that question in general Doju
 dbdr: it depends what those numbers mean
 Doju: hm. well, lets say they might correspond to pellets in some way. just maybe
 Doju: I really don
 eulerscheZahl: a secret
 dbdr: :hear_no_evil:
 eulerscheZahl: :see_no_evil:
 Doju: well i would say it but people here apparently dont like it when you share ideas or even just a bit of pseudocode
 avdg: Well, I had few close games.. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461412517">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461412517</a>
 eulerscheZahl: ideas are fine. won't be an idea that pushes you to top10 i suppose
 Doju: okay
 Doju: definitely not one
 anid: congrats ameler!!
 MonZtaDeluxe: i can give you the idea that i'm currently coding if you want Doju
 Hjax: who cares about ideas being shared? if someone wants to give out good ideas, its their loss
 ameler: thank you anid&#160;:)
 Doju: so it's just the distances to closest normal pellet and super pellet respectively 
 avdg: what if it is a win win like having a vaccin?
 WINWINWIN: Just joining the contest&#160;:( How is it?
 Doju: fun yet bugful.
 eulerscheZahl: there's a monitor to win
 dbdr: why do I always lose more matches against bottom players than mid-rank players?
 Hjax: no t-shirts this time though 
 WINWINWIN: :D not for me eulerscheZahl
 Doju: In the time i've put into this i could've earned 3 monitors at minimum wage lmao
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have much hopes either :D
 dbdr: I forgot to ask for my OOC t-shirt. probably too late now
 eulerscheZahl: huh? no email for you?
 Hjax: contests are hard, i think i over-performed in utg, i think ill do worse this time 
 dbdr: I stopped reading email
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Hjax: getting top 10 again would be awesome though 
 kovi: it was canceled - at least for me
 Doju: oh btw eulerscheZahl, so pseudocode is not fine?
 dbdr: canceled?
 eulerscheZahl: no shipping during corona?
 dbf: the same as RAIC&#160;:(
 kovi: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: pseudocode is fine
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, was about to mention RAIC
 dbdr: makes sense
 kovi: and topcoder actually
 eulerscheZahl: they wrote that they are about to ship it soon
 eulerscheZahl: then BOOM
 eulerscheZahl: cancelled or just delayed?
 dbf: yes, but I ordered some stuff on amazon recently and it is already somewhere in Moscow airport :relieved:
 kovi: topcoder - still in indiaraic delaycg - no idea...probably delay
 dbdr: are there new tshirt designs?
 ArchilA: helpppp&#160;:(  how on earth can i inplement Depth First Search on this thing :O
 eulerscheZahl: the cube one for CG
 kovi: they cancel the order-site
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm awaiting a tshirt from Kotlin heroes
 Hjax: man you guys play a lot of programming sites 
 Doju: ArchilA i'd imagine it's just recursively calling some function
 dbdr: I should get the cube
 avdg: need to change my change logic, it's not taking into account where it is going :p
 cegprakash: I added 40 asserts on my code so far
 dbdr: whatever that is. sounds good&#160;:)
 cegprakash: :D
 Doju: ArchilA not 100% sure though, maybe read the wiki page or something?
 avdg: so now, my ai changes to kill a pac while it is running into another one
 eulerscheZahl: the cube looks nice. a twisted rubiks cube
 dbdr: very hungarian&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: but with a glitch, 2 surfaces are merged together, they forgot the separating line

 eulerscheZahl: bad resolution
 avdg: * or getting run into some other pac
 eulerscheZahl: looks less pixelated with it arrives
 Tiramon: arg 0.06
 eulerscheZahl: soon ceg2
 dbdr: reminds me of futurama
 eulerscheZahl: stop pixeling your face?
 dbdr: "the resolution on this machine is great. higher than reality"
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 dbdr: I think Fry says that
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized the cube i linked isn't the final design
 eulerscheZahl: but looks similar
 Doju: now i have 5 ugly ifs and elses but it works, so whatever.
 eulerscheZahl: great if you get paid by lines
 dbdr: or by branches
 Doju: Damn, Inky is aggressive
 Tiramon: ok my dead fix did not work&#160;;)
 ArchilA: is something wron with web code?  should not my variables get reset at every turn?  wtf is going on
 Tiramon: depends on how you defined them
 Tiramon: or in what scope
 ArchilA: it's list object. all pacs that belong to me should be aded anew at every turn
 Doju: hahah this is the pinnacle of my coding career
 Uljahn: do you reuse the same list?
 Doju: if False:
 BenWo: inspired
 Tiramon: then it is propably in a scope were the varaible is not deleted after your loop
 ArchilA: list variable is inside loop, so at every turn it starts with zero elements and is added later in other loop
 Tiramon: paste a code snippet and tell us what language you use ... maybe we can help
 Uljahn: i guess it's py3
 ArchilA: python. i have empty lists inside while True loop
 ArchilA: and add elements later at other loops inside to gather information on pellets and pacs
 Uljahn: easiest way is to you debug print
 Uljahn: *to use
 ArchilA: while True:
 ArchilA: dunno how to use debug thing here
 Tiramon: does py have scopes that clears variables?
 Doju: print("something", file=sys.stderr)
 Uljahn: print(args, file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Tiramon: wasn't it like php with method wide scope? so if is not resetd manually it isn't reseted?
 avdg: best way too loose I guess...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461437329">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461437329</a>
 Uljahn: in python it's not reseted. it's rebound, variable names are just aliases
 Tiramon: both have no idea where to search for more pellets
 avdg: something broke in my exploration search
 ArchilA: Standard Error Stream:MOVE 0 25 13 |MOVE 1 9 13 |MOVE 2 4 13 |Game Summary:ArchilA has not provided 1 lines in time
 ArchilA: wtf is this
 eulerscheZahl: and everything in python is an object. even a class is an object (not the instance, the class itself)
 avdg: but I only loose a few games because of that
 WINWINWIN: Rudimentary heuristics enough to get out of Wood 2?
 Tiramon: you made your commands as err output
 Tiramon: err output is debug output
 Doju: you can probs get out of wood 2 by going to random cells
 Tiramon: so the game did not receive your commands
 WINWINWIN: I am going to the nearest super_pellet else nearest pellet
 ArchilA: oh ok. i'll use it in except. 
 avdg: lol my eating logic was also broken
 avdg: it wanted to eat but all it did was run in circles
 Adnmaster: WINWINWIN going to a random power pellet will do it, worked by me
 Doju: winwinwin i'm almost certain that that will get you to bronze provided that you dont have any bugs
 WINWINWIN: No bugs, 100% winrate in wood 2
 WINWINWIN: Yeah, looks like easy wood1
 ArchilA: my pacs trying to get to big ones and afterwards move randomly, but still losing&#160;:/ wtf
 MindControler: WINWINWIN u can get to bronze easily
 Peudoki: losing is bad strategy
 WINWINWIN: thanks @MindController&#160;:)
 Adnmaster: im new in bronze, any suggestions for strategy?
 Doju: ArchilA perhaps get the small ones after big ones are gone?
 Doju: Adnmaster a simple one is nearest pellet but that'l only get you so far
 Peudoki: kill them all Adnmaster
 Doju: although it'll almost get you to silver if you do it right
 Doju: speaking from experience
 Adnmaster: ok, guess ill kill them all&#160;:)
 shashwat986: Is there any downside to just deploying my code every time I make a change, to test out how it is?
 Peudoki: nah, just look at how the leader is playing and get some ideas
 ArchilA: @Doju i'm doing that, but since not all pellets are seen if i do not see any pellets or enough pellets i try to go to random x y
 Peudoki: no dwnside shash, submit a lot
 Doju: ArchilA hey, i'll send you a replay and i'll let you figure out an important realization
 Tiramon: damn why did i buy a resin printer during  covid... bad delivery times for disposable gloves and concentrated alcohol
 ArchilA: but sometimes, coz i go in loop into my pacs list, it goes weird&#160;:/
 shashwat986: thanks Peudoki
 Adnmaster: where can we view all the moderators?
 BenjaminUrquhart: you don't
 Doju: ArchilA <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461444083">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461444083</a>
 Tiramon: below the chat is a participants link
 Tiramon: that shows all online players
 Tiramon: and mods at the top
 Adnmaster: ok, but is there any way i can view offline moderators names?
 Doju: see what my pacs are doing there?
 Tiramon: not afaik Adnmaster maybe they are listed somewhere, but not afaik
 ArchilA: yep. so how on earth am i supposed to make my pacs go somewhere else except pellets that are reachable?&#160;:/
 Doju: so, when the grid is spawned
 BenjaminUrquhart: you look for pellets
 Doju: all cells have a pellet
 Tiramon: you could expect that every field you havn't visited yet contains a pellet
 JasperV: I don't understand what the use is of retaining dead pacs in the input list
 Tiramon: or every field you haven't seen without pellet
 JasperV: the fact that they changed it must mean there is a good reason but why..
 SemChumboPT: JasperV you can always make your Pacs Text something when they pass a dead pac
 ArchilA: so u r saying that i should run to random coords that possibly have pellets?
 BenjaminUrquhart: not necessarily random
 Doju: that's a strategy
 Tiramon: or you just keep a list of coords 
 Doju: but you could apply some logic to it
 Doju: such as nearest (schröginder) pellet
 Doju: schrödinger* lol
 SemChumboPT: can you see past a Pac?
 Tiramon: a schrödiger pellet nice name&#160;;)
 ArchilA: yep
 Tiramon: only walls block your LOS
 ArchilA: but am i able to know if i got to my destination?
 Tiramon: and watch out there are maps hat have rows without walls so you could get into an infinite loop
 ijc90: do you program interaction with enemy pacmans? It feels like noone does it... 
 BenjaminUrquhart: your pacs do interact with others pacs yes
 SemChumboPT: ArchilA only if you check if your last position is hte same
 Doju: ijc90 currently not, soon yes
 ArchilA: i tried interaction but  could not get it working&#160;:/
 ijc90: im on bronze league
 Tiramon: ijc90 mine have minimal interaction with switch and if i have a save kill i also move to them
 ijc90: im thinking on just defending myself on close pacmans if i have cd on ability
 Tiramon: else i try to avoid enemy pacs
 ijc90: i have some logic on collition, if I get stuck i go to somewhere random
 ijc90: but that's it on interaction
 ijc90: im focusing on pellets and doing well till now
 Doju: oh right, i have that too
 Doju: I just introduced the same vision bug to my code that i fixed a while ago
 Doju: and i don't remember what the cause was
 Doju: ._.
 DollarAkshay: Are there any new rules in silver&#160;?
 Tiramon: only that pacs with typeId DEAD  are listed
 Tiramon: breaks some bots
 WINWINWIN: in the indian chat, it says something about dead pacs
 SemChumboPT: silver league has dead pacs
 Zenoscave: It broke mine hardcore
 Eglerion: wait... what do dead ones do? just sit there and block the way? :o 
 SemChumboPT: I'm still struggling to get past bronze without using speed or switch, but i gues i'll have to give up on that
 Zenoscave: no, they disapear still
 Nerchio: my commit was fixed dead pacs hopefully last time xD
 Doju: Ah it's not the vision but the pathfinding that is broken
 Doju: lovely.
 jthemphill: Eglerion it's basically a bugfix - it was sometimes impossible to be sure if you killed an opposing pac or if they just rounded a corner
 Thiesjoo: Does anyone have some tips to get out of bronze?
 Clagus: ok cool, so it doesn't affect the game rules :P it's just a additional info
 AntiSquid: play vs boss mainly
 Eglerion: ah, okay... cool. 
 MadKnight: make a simple pathfinder ThierryC
 MadKnight: Thiesjoo
 Thiesjoo: It already goes to the closest pellet, fights of enemy's and does some evasion
 ThierryC: yes, on the todo list&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: My map exploring is just not on point
 AntiSquid: so fix that
 ThierryC: ah not for me, but still valid point MadKnight :p
 AntiSquid: you know what to fix then why ask
 Thiesjoo: If there are any other tips
 AntiSquid: focus on fixing your bot
 AntiSquid: best tip evr
 Thiesjoo: Ok thanks, about 100 ranks to go
 Thiesjoo: Will continue tomorrow
 AntiSquid: that's not much
 Thiesjoo: It's not much, but it's hard
 Astrobytes: Just ask MSmits Thiesjoo&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: ping smits and tell him when you fixed your bot
 Thiesjoo: Will ask him in the next physics lesson
 WINWINWIN: looks like the easiest multi to start with&#160;:) 15 minutes of code gets to #542 in Bronze
 jthemphill: Thiesjoo you're one of MSmits' students? jealous
 AntiSquid: ah is he your teacher Thiesjoo?
 Thiesjoo: Yes
 jthemphill: very cool!
 Doju: WINWINWIN dude
 Thiesjoo: Very cool teacher actually
 Doju: i'm at 323
 Doju: and maybe 50 hours hahah
 AntiSquid: does he skip class to do bot programming instead Thiesjoo&#160;? you can tell us
 Nerchio: lol
 jthemphill: :laughing:
 WINWINWIN: @Doju Easy to start but I probably wont improve much on this :P
 Doju: Although my next submit will improve that once this bug is gone
 Thiesjoo: Sadly he doesn't, but immediately after the lesson he continues with his bot
 Astrobytes: :D
 Doju: haha that's awesome
 Thiesjoo: I just finished my lesson and i saw him in chat here
 Doju: oh speaking of school
 Doju: i just remembered that my finals results are coming in tomorrow
 RockyMullet: holy shit, I think dead bots are actually blocking my paths
 AntiSquid: ya some people on cg know each other in real life
 RockyMullet: I fixed the dead bot thing too fast
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 RockyMullet: ew real life
 Tiramon: if (typeId == "DEAD") continue;is the fastest fix&#160;;)
 RockyMullet: it would be if I was smart
 JasperV: I just applied that fix Tiramon :D
 ijc90: can you see other people games? like watch how the "top1" of my league performs to "reverse engenieer"? is it even legal?
 BenjaminUrquhart: yes
 dbf: ijc90 you can create as many games with anyone from you league as you want
 Uljahn: also there are "last battles" links in general leaderboard
 Uljahn: i mean full lb
 o_imej: hey, why does my pallets slow down when the other enemy uses the speed boost&#160;? i mean my pacsbut his does not&#160;? 
 Doju: o_imej your pacs don't actually slow down
 avdg: they are warp frames
 o_imej: so the enemy pacs also get the same effect&#160;?
 avdg: the frames represent something happening, not time by definition
 avdg: (in a linear way)
 Uljahn: enemy pacs just have one bonus frame because of speed boost
 jthemphill: games can have more than 200 frames due to warp frames, correct?
 Uljahn: yep
 MonZtaDeluxe: omg - i just realized, that my pacs prefered low value pellets over high value pellets -.-"
 Doju: hahah, well that's good to notice MonZtaDeluxe
 journeyvivek: hello
 Doju: Hey BagChaser
 journeyvivek: hey
 journeyvivek: anyone do moblile app
 Doju: umm nope
 journeyvivek: what do u dev
 journeyvivek: new to coding here
 Doju: alright
 MonZtaDeluxe: BagChaser: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2020</a>click here - this is what we are coding
 MattSOrme: hmm, my code seemed to be timing out, I added a time check to see what i was getting, and now its working&#160;:/ 
 journeyvivek: thank you
 Fosfen: Hello&#160;! I'm currently ~500 in bronze league, I'm thinking about optimizing my pacmen paths (to avoid collisions, path following...) is it a good idea to reach Silver&#160;? 
 Kellthazar: What a nice battle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461477725">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461477725</a>
 Kellthazar: Fosfen oh yeah
 [CG]Thibaud: avoid collisions seems like a good idea
 Hjax: i just have my pacs go after different targets and pray :D 
 Fosfen: Thanks I'll try it then&#160;! :D
 DollarAkshay: Does line of sight go through enemy pacs&#160;?
 RockyMullet: DollarAkshay yes
 DollarAkshay: Thanks
 avdg: working on social distancing measurements in my bot
 Doju: hah avdg :D
 Doju: I should do something similar
 Doju: Also why on earth am i getting path lengths of well over 200
 avdg: but it's more that my bot get stuck when very near to other bots
 Kellthazar: Omg, bronze rank 2
 Kellthazar: gooo!
 RockyMullet: fixing the dead thing made my bot worse...
 Kellthazar: I was promoted to silver
 Kellthazar: yey!
 Doju: gratz Kellthazar
 SemChumboPT: Parabéns Kellthazar&#160;!!
 wlesavo: RockyMullet are you sure? maybe other bots evolved
 SabertheLost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba74ea2a-f936-4f61-a3ec-fdf924e1036e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ba74ea2a-f936-4f61-a3ec-fdf924e1036e</a>
 SabertheLost: anyone 
 SabertheLost: pacman 3 is on 27, 7
 SabertheLost: MOVE 2 27 7|MOVE 3 27 7|MOVE 4 27 7
 SabertheLost: - Pac 2 moved to (26, 7).- Pac 4 is dead! It cannot be 
 RockyMullet: wlesavo yeah likely that
 SabertheLost: Also, ealier in the game my pac4 stopped moving from the same spot until he got eaten =(
 SabertheLost: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461481807">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461481807</a>
 Doju: yeess it finally works
 Kukiss: uaaa introduced speed to my pacs and I skyrocked in bronze :D1st place after 50% submission, I am affraid to touch anything
 cegprakash: oh
 cegprakash: so speed helps
 Kukiss: yup, it's jsut basic speed... Do it whenever you can
 cegprakash: do u also switch Kukiss
 Eglerion: SabertheLost you're telling him to go to 27 7 while he is at 27 7, why would you expect him to move?
 MattSOrme: im counting my time, and its under 50ms, but im still getting timeouts? Any ideas?
 avdg: load on cpu?
 SabertheLost: Hmm, your right, I wounder how that can happen =)
 Doju: just dropped 1300 ranks because of a typo. isn't that fun
 avdg: dunno what about delay with lots of memory activity
 Kukiss: cegrapakash I have simple switch logic to defend myself but after I started doing speed whenever I can, I am probably not switching right now with my bot.It is a place for an improvment
 SabertheLost: actully all of them is moving to that spot, lol
 SabertheLost: was looking at computer output =/
 avdg: you see, not social distancing is bad
 Kukiss: ok, so now it is time to fix the dead types :D
 Kellthazar: I use speed to control my target selection and to verify threats and potential victories as well.
 TheOnlyJoker: congrat men!
 Nerchio: kovi maybe 47 should try to run&#160;;)
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461494238">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461494238</a>
 Nerchio: nvm
 Nerchio: it was a frame :D
 Nerchio: can't run when you can't move big brain
 avdg: hmm found something, opponent were invisible to me&#160;:/
 avdg: and that is because I swapped x and y
 Kellthazar: Another thing that improved my pacs a lot was controlling the range of the targets of each pacman (even the enemies) and crossing them to choose the least competitive.
 avdg: lol
 avdg: my pacs are literally moved away
 avdg: because I added too much penalty that had no effect before
 cegprakash: 6 losses in 27 games.. this submit seems promising
 SabertheLost: where does it say you cannot move and use speed at the same time?
 cegprakash: I've a depth = 3 I get 6000 sims&#160;:( 
 cegprakash: I miss my old code with 90000 sims 
 avdg: you can only have 1 action per ai per turn
 avdg: or else the game will error
 Eglerion: SabertheLost "abilityCooldown: the number of turns until you can request a new ability for this pac (SWITCH and SPEED)"  and "Each pac has access to two abilities (SWITCH and SPEED) that share the same cooldown period of 10 turns." 
 avdg: yes, it's not greatly documented
 BenWo: Pacs can receive the following commands (a pac can only receive one command per turn):
 SabertheLost: ok, becouse i could not see that you anywhere that you can only give one command to each pacman
 Kellthazar: My code broke in the silver league: "SWITCH 0 DEAD" XD
 BenWo: lol
 BenWo: playing dead?
 Waffle3z: does that work?
 Kellthazar: That was my defensive move...
 wlesavo: Waffle3z yes, all your pacs insta dies
 Kellthazar: Invalid command&#160;:)
 aenigma: is there a keyboard shortcut for the replay in same conditions button&#160;? 
 avdg: cg local has an auto play feature on safe
 avdg: but I rather want it now on the replay button
 avdg: broke my bot :D
 avdg: maybe I'll submit my bot from yesterday for a moment
 Cappefra: ok so I tried to implement my first monte carlo and it's stupid af
 Cappefra: It went sideways somewhere :D
 cegprakash: I don't know why my  GA uses switch  sometimes :D
 cegprakash: 2 losses in first 17 games go go go..
 Kellthazar: cegprakash Did you implemented a genetic algorithm?
 cegprakash: yes 
 cegprakash: i still have bugs on my collision but my win rate is impressive.. 78% win rate at 55%
 cegprakash: seems like I need a nearly perfect sim to beat heuristics
 MattSOrme: i've got a timer starting after my while True, and ending just before i print my command. Its returning less than 50ms by several ms, yet im timing out...Any reason or change to my calculations needed?
 avdg: had to remove all my bogus penalties to get back in shape
 njaber: you should probably put the timer after the read to get accurate timing,that being said I think there's more chance that this is a crash/invalid output/whatever rather then a true timeout
 Kellthazar: cegprakash my attempts with GA on CG always is a big failure XD
 njaber: if you put it before the read it'll start the timer at the end of your turn ~= beginning of the opponent's turn
 njaber: ~=*
 njaber: wat
 MattSOrme: running same conditions again passes. Seems like an issue on CG side maybe?
 njaber: tilde=
 njaber: Possible
 njaber: It happened on a few languages form many people, they may not have fixed it yet
 njaber: what language?
 MattSOrme: are you saying i should put the clock after the score input?
 njaber: Yes
 MattSOrme: im python
 njaber: Yeah python has had problems I think
 njaber: This may still be you tho, you probably hould test further
 MattSOrme: Got enough problems with time as it is over the C++ crowd, dont need more problems&#160;;)
 njaber: Do you understand why you need to put the timer after the read btw?
 Counterbalance: MattSOrme also print the commands to stderr just in case;if you have  while&#160;! timeout, it can be that that loop is never entered and so there's no command 
 njaber: ^
 MattSOrme: Not really. But im assuming its something to do with the way CG stops and starts my process?
 MattSOrme: half explains why earlier i was logging 51+ ms and not getting timeouts though
 njaber: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/96f822e7-4f5e-48ec-879a-01f39be490fd">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/96f822e7-4f5e-48ec-879a-01f39be490fd</a>
 njaber: Why
 njaber: I was just typing
 njaber: I didn't paste anything
 njaber: guess I write too much
 Hjax: does someone have that infinite line of sight test seed?
 BenjaminUrquhart: one sec
 njaber: In short, if you start the clock vefore the read you get the opponent's time + your time each turn
 Nerchio: poor pac waiting for his dead friend&#160;;( 71+frames
 RubenFilipe: is python good?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/27516599de0d56e6d735b2513055907f027b369a">https://www.codingame.com/ide/27516599de0d56e6d735b2513055907f027b369a</a>
 Counterbalance: njaber bot processes are paused though
 Grudo: yay silver for the first time \o/
 avdg: let seed = 1234567890;const rand = () =&gt; ((seed = (seed * 16807)&#160;% 2147483647) - 1) / 2147483646;
 RubenFilipe: should I code in python for this challenge?
 avdg: feel free to adjust seed
 BenjaminUrquhart: Hjax seed=-7826971533994987500
 Hjax: thanks ben
 njaber: Counterbalance from my testing they aren't, but I may have not tested well enough
 avdg: (oh, cg seeds? srr)
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's a second one somewhere
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you're interested, I can find that one too
 Hjax: one is plenty 
 BenjaminUrquhart: cool
 Counterbalance: njaber you get a few ms because of the delay, but as soon as the engine has read your bots input, it's paused, and later unpaused when the referee sends input for the next turn
 njaber: Ok I guess you can't cheat that way then... what would happen if you made a child process/called another program to do calculations though? You could launch a program with the source code/asm code as a string maybe?
 BenjaminUrquhart: your core is basically suspended during hte opponent's turn
 Counterbalance: From what I've read they use linux cgroups and the bot + all child processes are paused so that won't work either 
 jthemphill: RubenFilipe python is fine
 njaber: too bad
 njaber: well I guess it's actually nice because it makes it fairer
 Illedan: Code faster code instead :P
 Counterbalance: maybe someday they'll have GPU support.. 12 teraflops would be nice to have&#160;;)
 Illedan: :P
 Inst6541: Are there easier competitions for beginners?
 BenjaminUrquhart: go under the compete tab
 BenjaminUrquhart: bot programming
 BenjaminUrquhart: bear in mind they're not actual contests (some were)
 Inst6541: yup, I already scored a bronze league in Coders Strike Back. What I have in mind is something like clash of corers, but more beginner-friendly
 Inst6541: *coders
 MSmits: *code
 cegprakash: i hope my bugs are fixed now
 cegprakash: give me silver already..
 ArmoredAssassin: guys one question.. after those 6 days when contest ends.. will it be really gone or I'll be able to play around some more?
 cegprakash: u can play in multi ArmoredAssassin but why think about that now
 cegprakash: focus on the contest
 cegprakash: all in into contest
 duckquackduck: @cegprakash, you are coing late into night :O Do you have work in the morning?
 cegprakash: I told my company I'm taking part in an AI contest representing the company
 cegprakash: and I'll contribute less this week
 cegprakash: I am mentoring an intern
 cegprakash: and work 1-2 hrs a day
 cegprakash: so I manage
 duckquackduck: nice company
 EBMdollar4LIFE: hi
 njaber: Hi, I don't like seeing you getting no answer&#160;: (
 BenWo: hi&#160;:)
 cegprakash: mm I'm not checking collsion when my bots cross each other
 BenjaminUrquhart: hi
 cegprakash: i got only 70 games
 cegprakash: oh no
 cegprakash: 70% win rate and rank 21&#160;:(
 Counterbalance: against 2.5k players..
 Nerchio: top5 after a lucky run but for now im out of ideas ;s
 Scarfield: nice :muscle:
 cegprakash: I have so many bugs in collision on this contest. No wonder I hated CSB
 Scarfield: collisions on CSB is at least math based, i just had a match, where 2 of my pacs where going for the same cell ( for a while..) then an opponent pac joined in (for a bit), then the opponent pac switched, and could move to the cell after mine had finished colliding, 
 Scarfield: also this, from frame 80
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461585269">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461585269</a>
 Scarfield: this time the opponent had speed, so it makes some sense it gets to the cell, but the collisions after are just wierd to me
 BenjaminUrquhart: raingrrl why follow me
 Scarfield: its the new black
 Scarfield: to follow you that is
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRV7uVfCcCM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRV7uVfCcCM</a>
 Clagus: @Scarfield for me it looks ok
 Clagus: makes sense
 Clagus: your pacs are blocking each other
 Clagus: oh no
 Clagus: actually you are right... I think it's a bug
 Clagus: after enemy switching to paper, he should be able to execute on your scissors
 Clagus: you should report that, I think it's a bug
 Scarfield: yea i would think that as well, but i have saved the replay link, to ask about tommow
 Scarfield: btw Clagus you dont need the "@" to ping someone, just their name.
 Clagus: ok, thx :D didn't know that
 Scarfield: you can also auto complete a name with tab Cl -&gt; tab&#160;:)
 Clagus: sick!
 Scarfield: it is quite extreme yes
 DollarAkshay: Sometimes you wish they enabled Friendly Fire

 njaber: I don't think it's a bug, it's clearly said in the rules that death is resolved after collisions
 Scarfield: you really want that super pellet xD
 Scarfield: but what is the blue pac colliding with then in this instance?
 Clagus: njaber but when enemy pacs have different types there should be no collision
 njaber: Oh right I didn't pay close enoug hattention
 njaber: Isn't this what whatever this means is about? "If the pacs are of different types, they can land on the same cell, but a pac can't cross the path of a stronger pac: it will be blocked."
 cegprakash: Bluepioupiou stop wrecking me
 MonZtaDeluxe: that moment when you press "Play my code" and you beat the AI
 MonZtaDeluxe: Dopamine deluxe
 Scarfield: ah, i think you are correct njaber

 Scarfield: if it cant eat the other pellet, it wont move, i wondered what "stronger pac" meant, that must be it&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: it still counter intuitive - the red rock should eat the blue scissors
 Clagus: wait... does that mean, that when 2 enemies are next to each other, and are of different types, and are trying to go into each other cells, they are blocked?
 Scarfield: no, then the collide and the one that can eat the other will eat and move
 Scarfield: then they*
 MattSOrme: oh man, im so close. Running code and its staying in the top 10, but not going above inky
 njaber: Clagus no, but if 2 allies and 1 enemy do, they are
 Scarfield: My guess is that its also about order of the pacs, my pacs block each other first, then the blue cant move onto "the stronger" pac
 Clagus: njaber yeah I can see that
 Clagus: apparently, that's how it works :P funny
 Clagus: programming edge cases is hard :D
 njaber: Ok so basically what this "If the pacs are of different types, they can land on the same cell, but a pac can't cross the path of a stronger pac: it will be blocked." means is just, "your pacs can't suicide"
 Counterbalance: hm so to get a good sim you'd need to know which player you are
 njaber:&#160;?
 Counterbalance: because the order matters
 njaber: No
 njaber: wait
 Scarfield: im afraid so yea
 njaber: lemme check
 njaber: Okay no, it doesn't
 njaber: Lemme try to get this right
 njaber: 1) Move all, blocking pacs which are going to a cell that is occupied by a stronger pac, or from which a stronger pac is coming from2) If a pac shares a cell with an incompatible pac (same team or same type) move it back one cell (all moves are done at once)3) do 2 until no more collisions4) Resolve eating
 njaber: Ohwait
 njaber: I get it
 njaber: "Can't cross path" doesn't mean "can't suicide", it means "can't siwthc place with a stronger pac", basically, if going the same way a strong pac is comming from, prevents the move so the strong pac can eat it... unless the pac is moved back
 njaber: So order doesn't matter
 njaber: But readable rules sure do
 njaber: readability of rules*
 Counterbalance: in that case no, but in the replay there's 4 pacs at play, 3 of which are colliding
 njaber: 1) Try moving all, blue paper is prevented to move because would cross path with red scissors.2) move back incompatible pacs (red rock and red scissors)3) repeat (red paper)4) eat, but no pac share a cell anymore
 Counterbalance: hm
 Counterbalance: red rock is moved first, but, you say it's prevented to move because it would land on blue paper and get eaten - that would explain it, but it's still a bit weird
 njaber: Actually no, red rock moves at the same times as all other, the only pac prevented to move from the start is blue paper
 njaber: because it "crosses path" == would switch place if there were no collisions
 Counterbalance: okay i get it
 njaber: By if there were no collisions I mean in a theoretical alternative ruleset where pacs don't collide
 njaber: Now to go back to fixing my broken code
 Counterbalance: so if the red scissors on the right were to stay put, the blue paper would get eaten
 njaber: I believe so
 njaber: actually no
 njaber: wait
 njaber: yes
 njaber: I'm 99% sure
 Counterbalance: yeah me too
 Scarfield: the same if the red rock were to stay put, i think im getting it, thank you&#160;:)
 njaber: Yes, I think we finally solved it
 Scarfield: well not the same, then the red scissor would nom nom the paper
 Scarfield: well you did :p
 njaber: in both cases the red scissors would nom, but the cell on which the nom happen wouldn't be the same
 Counterbalance: yup
 njaber: my brain is having a hard time with this after getting only 5 hours of sleep in the past 60 hours
 njaber: And I'm delaying fixing my code
 DollarAkshay: Damns 
 DollarAkshay: Thats too less
 njaber: I'm still able to code, that's how I know I still don't absolutly require sleep
 Scarfield: yea&#160;:/ sleep is important
 njaber: I get enough sleep when outside of code-rushiing periods so this shouldn't be to problematic
 DollarAkshay: You have plenty of time for this contest
 DollarAkshay: Dont see why you should ruin your sleep
 njaber: *Not enough*
 cegprakash: if I go right with my scissor and opponent comes left with a paper do I move right after killing him or stay where I was?
 NinjaDoggy: it's not code rushing period yet :P
 NinjaDoggy: it's still chill figure out some nice strategies time
 NinjaDoggy: sleeping more is worth
 karppo: +1 for sleep. I have issues with that and I dont want the same to others. 
 DollarAkshay: @cegprakash You move
 muy31: why is my code timing out?
 BenjaminUrquhart: because it takes tool ong
 BenjaminUrquhart: too long
 njaber: I just want to get my tracking algorithm to work so I can finally work on improving the actual bot
 muy31: it takes 10 ms to read input
 cegprakash: oh
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f0800df6-d702-4873-a11f-e7a07f76139c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f0800df6-d702-4873-a11f-e7a07f76139c</a>
 Scarfield: start your timing after reading the first input
 muy31: that is how many ms it goes before timing
 muy31: out
 Hjax: is there a tool that generates sample inputs for games? id like to paste engine "input" into my bot with a debugger attached  
 muy31: it times out on a particular function
 muy31: but the function itself doesn't take long
 muy31: or at least no one part does
 Scarfield: well speaking of sleep, gn and happy coding&#160;:)
 muy31: yeah i could use what hjax asked for to
 muy31: *too
 njaber: gn
 muy31: some sample first turn input
 muy31: Anyone have that?
 Hjax: im about to just print my inputs to debug, probably works lul
 muy31: when you do that would you be willing to share your first turn input?
 muy31: Hjax
 muy31:&#160;?
 Hjax: @muy31 how did you do that paste thing?
 muy31: just copy and paste from the codingame ide or console
 njaber: Have more then 5 lines of text, it's as simple as that
 muy31: when you send it off, it automatically gives a link
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b89e3f03-7f2d-40cb-a2b9-47e8b027f663">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b89e3f03-7f2d-40cb-a2b9-47e8b027f663</a>
 Hjax: fancy 
 njaber: Or too many characters, I don't exactlly how many tho
 Hjax: theres a sample input 
 muy31: lol Hjax
 muy31: thank you
 Hjax: no problem
 DollarAkshay: Submit and Sleep Time.
 DollarAkshay: Currently Rank 1860 Bronze
 muy31: Hjax I think it's incomplete
 Hjax: its not
 Hjax: well, its missing a newline at the end 
 Hjax: hit enter after 
 muy31: is visiblePacCount 3&#160;?
 Hjax: yes
 Hjax: seed=-3887776996794057700 if you want to see the map 
 muy31: oh ok the nvm
 muy31: *then
 njaber: Let's play 'find the bug in the numerical calculations which you aren't even sure of the exact supposed result' yay
 BenWo: love that game
 Braykin08: The best debugging tip I've ever learn is too always an hypothesis on what to expect from the debug data you gather. Printf or break point doesn't matter
 njaber: probably a stupid "+/-1" to add somewhere
 njaber: Like I said, I don't know what to expect because it's a chain of numerical calculations where the exact result should be the limit of my movement speed or something but I can't calculate that in my head when I'm this sleepy
 muy31: i found it out: my timeout is due to an out of memory error
 njaber: +1 didn't work, yay, now I have even less of a clue what's happening, my result may not actually be wrong which means I haven't identified the actually broken part... Yay
 njaber: There are just some many places where this thing could be going wrong
 DollarAkshay: 4x&#160;?
 njaber:&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: How much more is the time limit for python&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: 4x&#160;?
 BenjaminUrquhart: there's no crutch
 BenjaminUrquhart: 50ms for all
 muy31: how does System.gc() work? Does it delete unused objects?
 DollarAkshay: Hmm but my clock is printing 141 ms 
 BenjaminUrquhart: you're not starting hte timer at the right spt
 BenjaminUrquhart: spot*
 BenjaminUrquhart: muy31 it *requests* a gc
 BenjaminUrquhart: your bot shouldn't be running long enough to warrant a gc though
 BenjaminUrquhart: if you need a gc then cut down on creating new objects
 DollarAkshay: Clock is started after reading inout and sopped after printing output
 DollarAkshay: input*
 thethiny: stop before printing
 thethiny: or print then flush
 muy31: do static functions take up memory?
 muy31: too
 thethiny: if you mean heap
 thethiny: then yes
 Counterbalance: code uses very little memory compared to data
 jthemphill: ^
 jthemphill: muy31 you're probably creating way more things than you think you are somewhere
 muy31: i also make at most 10 Pac objects every turn
 muy31: but i neglect the old ones
 muy31: but it times out anyway at turn 1
 thethiny: this is negligible
 muy31: i have 4 classes in the file
 muy31: well i guess it wouldn't hurt to give y'all a code snippet, since my idea probably ground-breaking
 muy31: here is the function that screws it all up:
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/10d6d952-1fa3-4876-abee-fea6837b0ef2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/10d6d952-1fa3-4876-abee-fea6837b0ef2</a>
 thethiny: what language is that C#?
 muy31: Java
 thethiny: okay
 nu11us: can you see through pacs?
 jthemphill: nu11us yes
 muy31: nu11us you asking me?
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/512ee9f6-0189-4984-881c-bc088e1197ee">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/512ee9f6-0189-4984-881c-bc088e1197ee</a>
 thethiny: undefined variable
 nu11us: can you see enemies's cooldowns?
 Counterbalance: muy31 and you get a timeout without any stacktrace?
 muy31: yes Counterbalance
 jthemphill: nu11us yes, it's the abilityCooldown arg
 thethiny: @muy31 you are checking distances[][][][] but did you define it ealier?
 muy31: thethiny no undefined variable
 Kellthazar: nu11us if they are visible to you... yes
 nu11us: awesome
 nu11us: ty
 muy31: yeah duh
 jthemphill: muy31 have you bisected to the place where you timeout by printing to stderr?
 muy31: during the second code chunk in the snippet
 muy31: second for loop
 muy31: chunk
 jthemphill: muy31 so while calling evaluateScore?
 thethiny: AI.distances[loc[0]][loc[1]][p.choiceY][p.choiceX];
 thethiny: distances[r][c][p.y][p.x] &lt;= spacelength + 1 &amp;&amp;&#160;!(r == p.y &amp;&amp; c == p.x)){
 thethiny: are you sure you're using the correct Distances?
 thethiny: once it's AI. once it's just Distances
 muy31: no, i assure you that's not the error
 jthemphill: muy31 does that mean you timeout or oom when calling evaluateScore on every location? how many locations are you calling evaluateScore on?
 muy31: distances is a static array in AI class
 thethiny: yes dude but look at line 7
 thethiny: you're not using AI.distances
 muy31: it doesn't matter it's in AI class
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5129c66b-bc6d-4355-a26b-5548c0ff8720">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5129c66b-bc6d-4355-a26b-5548c0ff8720</a>
 Counterbalance: muy31 move the ArrayList&lt;int[]&gt; locations to a field and call clear() on it; it allocates 300 arrays every turn, it should help with speed and gc
 jthemphill: muy31 each time you call evaluateScore you create a new path
 muy31: yeah
 jthemphill: i think that might be the problem
 muy31: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/93ddcdfc-98f4-4ed3-b670-dc3ac610b7e5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/93ddcdfc-98f4-4ed3-b670-dc3ac610b7e5</a>
 muy31: that is findPath function
 jthemphill: you may be able to reuse an array and modify it by reference
 muy31: I precalculate distances
 jthemphill: doesn't matter, you're calling `new ArrayList` every time you call `findPath`
 muy31: *AI.distances so that it hold all distances from one point to another
 thethiny: are you calling evaluateDist inside the AI class?
 muy31: yeah thethiny
 muy31: the how m i supposed to make the path jthemphill
 muy31:&#160;?
 jthemphill: muy31 you reuse a single object
 muy31: you can't add to an uninitialized ArrayList
 thethiny: honestly I don't understand why you're complicating your find path 
 muy31: and the paths are different
 muy31: different end locations!
 thethiny: the paths are different but how many paths do you have?
 thethiny: try your algorithm on a samp[le map
 thethiny: it'll take around 3 seconds to finish
 muy31: only 5 - 6
 thethiny: the timeout is 1 second
 thethiny: try it offline and time it
 muy31: offline it is a meomry error
 muy31: along w/ timeout
 thethiny: does it say where exactly?
 thethiny: can you tell me the general idea of what you're trying to implement?
 muy31: path.add(a)
 thethiny: I mean in terms of pesudo
 thethiny: maybe we can find a more efficient psuedo for you
 muy31: when it tries to find the neighboring coordinate closest to the end/target cordinate
 njaber: I finally found my bug... I was using an &amp; instead of an | operation on one of my flag checks....
 BenjaminUrquhart: nice
 thethiny: nice
 muy31: oh thethiny i didn't see your last question
 muy31: i am calculating the shortest path from point a to b utilizing an already created BFS array of distances from point b
 muy31: and i am adding all the known pellets values within each path to figure out the best path
 muy31: and then, if two or more paths have the same max score, choose the one whose endpoint is closer to my longterm location goal
 thethiny: "and i am adding all the known pellets values within each path to figure out the best path"
 thethiny: give yourself a radius of max_search
 muy31: like comparison
 muy31: the radius is 2
 thethiny: just for debugging purposes, make the radius 1
 thethiny: or 0
 thethiny: so it never calls
 muy31: 1 works fine
 thethiny: if it still timeouts then the issue isn't here
 thethiny: hmmm
 thethiny: okay then you have an infinite loop
 thethiny: add a new list called seen
 thethiny: if (x, y) in seen
 thethiny: return 
 thethiny: since the next pellet sees the previous one
 thethiny: and previous one sees next one
 thethiny: and next one sees previous one
 thethiny: and previous one sees next one
 thethiny: forever
 thethiny: and ever after
 muy31: ok then, that's an idea
 muy31: thanks!
 thethiny: :D
 thethiny: instead of passing the map you can pass the "seen"
 thethiny: and only if it's a "path" then you populate seen
 muy31: oh damn, i just saw where it messed up
 thethiny: what is it
 muy31: i was using incorrect distances
 thethiny: what do you mean
 muy31: i was using distance from previously seen position to neighbor
 muy31: instead of neighbor to end
 thethiny: okay, try to see if it fixes it and let us know
 DollarAkshay: Damn Rank 9 Bronze XD
 DollarAkshay: So Close
 muy31: it works no more timeout!
 DollarAkshay: aaannnnnddd LOSS STREAK
 thethiny: congrats :D
 thethiny: to muy31 not to Dollar XD
 thethiny: I had an " if 1 &amp;&amp; 0" in my code :D very nice
 muy31: thank you thethiny and jthemphill
 thethiny: ^^
 DollarAkshay: Is my code run again on the Speed Ability turn&#160;?
 BenWo: nope
 Counterbalance: no
 DollarAkshay: Rank 8 Bronze :D 46%
 thethiny: nice
 thethiny: wd
 DollarAkshay: Not yet :P
 DollarAkshay: Yessss
 DollarAkshay: All i had to do was avoid enemy pacs who had their ability on cooldown
 cegprakash: DollarAkshay wow
 cegprakash: I have submitted my depth=1 bot as I got fed up with depth=3 :D
 cegprakash: I get less sims
 TrentT: How do you output text on a pac?
 thethiny: print("ACTION PACID TEXT TEXT TEXT)
 BenWo: add it on the end of a command
 TrentT: Ok cool thanks
 cegprakash: MOVE 0 1 2 hello | MOVE 1 2 3 how are u |
 TrentT: MOVE 0 1 2 cegprakash| MOVE 1 2 3 i am good |
 DollarAkshay: Im thinking of doing an RL bot 
 cegprakash: RL?
 DollarAkshay: Once I have pushed my limits with DFS
 Durkin: oh, thats odd, sudden promo, haven't touched this since last night
 cegprakash: wuuut
 thethiny: a bot that learns on its own
 HKTran: SPEED 0| I comment double then your turn
 thethiny: @Durkin too many people got promoted to silver
 TrentT: Dollar you should look at AlphaZero

 DollarAkshay: Yeah I have seen the video and documentary
 DollarAkshay: But AlphaGo is on another level
 cegprakash: wait
 DollarAkshay: Im think much smaller
 cegprakash: whut
 cegprakash: I'm above boss
 DollarAkshay: Nice
 cegprakash: I was rank 20 at 78% and rank 2 at 98%
 Durkin: too many like just now? because I was just hanging out in bronze after silver went out. Just now did it
 cegprakash: boss at rank 3
 DollarAkshay: @Durkin Yeah sometimes if people submit and you have a nice winning streak you will move up ranks 
 Durkin: ah, strange
 DollarAkshay: I think you beat me a few times
 DollarAkshay: And I was better than the boss
 DollarAkshay: That might have helped your ELO rating go up a bit
 cegprakash: 1 rank below bossI don't want to touch anything
 DollarAkshay: hahah
 DollarAkshay: LOSS STREAK INCOMING :P
 Counterbalance: yeeah it is looking good
 cegprakash: no I mean promote me
 cegprakash: or wreck the boss
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 cegprakash: I'm short by 0.1
 DollarAkshay: You are in silver&#160;?
 cegprakash: You have been promoted to Silver League of "Spring Challenge 2020"!
 thethiny: when it says Beat the boss
 DollarAkshay: Why did I just match against you @cegprakash&#160;?
 thethiny: it means in battle or in score?
 DollarAkshay: Oh Nice
 DollarAkshay: Welcome to the Club
 DollarAkshay: Just hot fix your code and submit again
 DollarAkshay: Ignore Dead pacs
 DollarAkshay: @Cegprakash your depth 1 bot jut got a double kill on my depth 15 bot

 cegprakash: lol DollarAkshay
 cegprakash: but u won the game
 cegprakash: kills don't matter
 cegprakash: I've given more score for kills
 cegprakash: as I like killing
 DollarAkshay: You are running some monte carlo tree search&#160;?
 cegprakash: nopes SA
 cegprakash: simple SA
 Hjax: does anyone know which direction a pac goes if theres two equidistant paths to the target?
 Hjax: matters a lot for knowing how pacs will path around single unpathable squares when told to move to the opposite diagonal 
 thethiny: random
 Counterbalance: did you make it, ceg?
 thethiny: shortest distance else random
 DollarAkshay: @hijax I was actually wondering about that today
 DollarAkshay: @Counterbalance yeah he did
 Hjax: random?!? i dont like that at all 
 Counterbalance: kewl
 thethiny: I have it rn as a replay
 jthemphill: Hjax is there any reason to tell a pac to move anywhere other than up/down/left/right in high-level play?
 thethiny: I'll send it
 thethiny: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461650365">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/461650365</a>
 Hjax: @jthemphill double moves from the speed command?
 thethiny: frame 27
 Kellthazar: Dont go for pellets with distance &gt; 5
 Kellthazar: pro tip
 jthemphill: Hjax oh oof
 NinjaDoggy: if you specify a move to 2 grids away it should be fine right
 thethiny: @Kellthazar if value &gt; min_value and distance &lt;= 5 \
 NinjaDoggy: the part i'm bummed about
 thethiny: already in my code
 NinjaDoggy: is not being able to move up and then down
 NinjaDoggy: when double moving&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: or like left and then right
 thethiny: @NinjaDoggy you need to check if the distance is &lt; 1, add +1 to the axis of that direction and move there
 thethiny: even if it's a wall
 Kellthazar: NinjaDoggy speedos pacs are too fast
 NinjaDoggy: wait what
 NinjaDoggy: if you specify a tile 2 away
 NinjaDoggy: there's only 1 path to get there right?
 thethiny: not really
 thethiny: it can be behind a wall
 thethiny: so there can be 2 directions
 NinjaDoggy: manually path...
 NinjaDoggy: i meant 2 tiles away
 NinjaDoggy: without walls
 thethiny: yes only 1 direction
 NinjaDoggy: am i misunderstanding the case?
 NinjaDoggy: we're talking about frame 27 with the middle red pacman right
 thethiny: yes
 NinjaDoggy: you want it to go left, up
 NinjaDoggy: so even if it's speedy
 NinjaDoggy: you can just tell it to move to 1,6
 NinjaDoggy: 15,6 *
 NinjaDoggy: and it would path properly
 thethiny: I know but what I'm showing in the replay is that it thought at first the closest path was to go down
 thethiny: then after it went there now the closest one is up
 thethiny: and goes in a loop
 cegprakash: new rules in silver wew
 thethiny: what are the new rules?
 cegprakash: yes
 cegprakash: Summary of new rules
 thethiny: that's it?
 cegprakash: meaning if A pac dies we get the information of dead pac
 cegprakash: that's all
 thethiny: but like
 thethiny: a pac only dies if u kill it
 thethiny: so u only have information about it... right?
 cegprakash: no
 DollarAkshay: if typeId == 'DEAD':
 thethiny: how come
 cegprakash: if u kill without vision
 NinjaDoggy: yeh you can run into a sad corner&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: and get ambushed
 Durkin: like going around the corner, was a problem for predicting algorithms
 thethiny: oh you mean you constantly have access to a dead pac?
 thethiny: I thought for 1 frame only
 thethiny: makes sense
 cegprakash: I think I can use this information to resign
 thethiny: lol?
 DollarAkshay: What do you mean @cegprakash&#160;?
 cegprakash: meaning if half my pacs are dead I can just print I resign
 cegprakash: and crash my bot
 thethiny: hahahaha no man
 thethiny: I've seen people beat me with 1 pac alive
 cegprakash: eulerscheZahl is blocking my path
 cegprakash: wantonly
 thethiny: he always does that
 thethiny: what u can do is that if n-1 of your pacs are dead
 thethiny: and you're cornered
 thethiny: print "Astronomia"

 DollarAkshay: XD
 DollarAkshay: Gotta go sleep
 NinjaDoggy: hm... rank 1 bot blunders that hard still
 NinjaDoggy: gj anyways XD
 NinjaDoggy: gn
 BenWo: oh wow, hadn't even seen my rank went up
 Kellthazar: I think that I can't make more great improvements to my heuristc...
 Kellthazar: Sad..
 TrentT: Anyone able to share how they handle moving away from attacking enemies?
 DollarAkshay: I use DFS and add a negative cost when an nemey pack can eatup my pac
 DollarAkshay: enemy pac*
 TrentT: Does that work well
 TrentT:&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: Pretty well I would say. Got me out of bronze
 DollarAkshay: I just need to store the last known location of nemey bots to improve my DFS
 DollarAkshay: Currently its just using line of sight to avoid them
 DollarAkshay: What algo are you using @TrentT&#160;?
 TrentT: I think the same as BFS, I just iterate through all the possible positions with recursion and move towards the route with highest points 
 TrentT: Whilst avoiding enemies, sometimes attacking and also focusing on the 10 pointers
 TrentT: Are you using speed yet?
 DollarAkshay: Try adding a discount factor
 DollarAkshay: The further the pelets the less valuable they are
 DollarAkshay: i basically multiply the points by 0.9 for every unit distance
 thethiny: good idea
 cegprakash: DollarAkshay reinforcement learning in the sense u analyze the pattern of opponent and play accordingly?
 cegprakash: like record his strategy in first 50 turns and based on that play from 51st turn
 cegprakash:&#160;?

 thethiny: oh nice
 thethiny: you're GMT + 6
 thethiny: that means you're asian
 thethiny: or live in Asia or east Russia
 thethiny: hello fellow Asian
 thethiny: Guys do we have to just defeat Inky (boss) or do we have to rank up higher than him?
 Ken_Fool: i believe we have to rank higher
 thethiny: and can you tell me how Score is calculated?
 thethiny: I don't seem to understand it
 Ken_Fool: i havent figured that out yet
 thethiny: Is it win ratio?
 thethiny: I doubt sinceI'm on a loss streak
 Ken_Fool: i dont think so cos even first in silver are below 50
 thethiny: okay
 thethiny: thanks
 Kellthazar: Number of victories I guess, weighted by the oponent MMR as well..
 thethiny: but that wouldn't make sense
 thethiny: because when I resubmit 
 thethiny: I jump higher than when I was before
 thethiny: even though I have less victories
 thethiny: so I believe losses are counted too
 Kellthazar: Yes, losses to a "weaker" bot has more impact I guess...
 berries: this is probably a dumb question but you have to include the spaces between the pacId x and y in the systemoutprintln MOVE command
 Kellthazar: Yeap
 Kellthazar: MOVE id x y
 berries: okay thanks
 Kellthazar: you  can append a msg too
 Kellthazar: MOVE id x y MSG
 Kellthazar: it'll be displayed on the pacman
 thethiny: @berries think of it this way, if you didn't have to include spaces then how will the game know if you meant 22 3 or 2 23 if your message wasmove0223
 berries: yeah i assumed that but i was hoping i was wrong because otherwise i have no idea why my code wont work 
 NapTown: it would tell you if the output was formatted incorrectly
 thethiny: you have issues with your code now?
 Kellthazar: Phew... my last submit is going terrible. 
 berries: yeah can't get the first version of my code working 
 thethiny: need assistance?
 berries: that would be amazing 
 thethiny: how many Pacs do u have active, 1 or more?
 thethiny: and what language
 berries: i have it completely commented and in java
 thethiny: you're in Bronze league or Wood 1?
 berries: i havent submitted a single thing so i believe 1
 thethiny: okay
 berries: wood 2 lmao 
 thethiny: okay so you have more than 1 pac, right?
 berries: theres two pacs, ones mine and ones the computers
 berries: or oppenents whatever
 thethiny: oh so it's always 1 pac?
 thethiny: never more?
 berries: yeah 
 thethiny: okay show me your print statement
 berries: System.out.println("MOVE "+pacc.id+" "+highestValue.x +" "+highestValue.y);
 thethiny: pacc.id?
 thethiny: not pac.id?
 BenjaminUrquhart: thicc
 thethiny: lol
 berries: yeah i just made a pac called pacc
 thethiny: Benjamin check this replay<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/461660263">https://www.codingame.com/replay/461660263</a>
 thethiny: @berries does it say that you didn't provide output, or timeout, or error?
 berries: says has not provided 1 lines in time
 berries: timed out 
 thethiny: and how many frames, 2/2 or more?
 berries: 2/2
 thethiny: okay so probably you didn't even reach the print section
 thethiny: before your print statement add this
 thethiny: System.err.println("Test")
 thethiny: and tell me if it shows "Test" in red 
 thethiny: in the console
 berries: okay 
 BenjaminUrquhart: thethiny twhy are you liek this
 berries: nope nothing 
 thethiny: lol
 berries: so definitely doesnt get to print
 thethiny: @berries then you probably have a time out
 thethiny: did you implement path finding yet?
 thethiny: So what do you think @BenjaminUrquhart :P
 berries: and not really path finding 
 berries: just going to the highest adjacent pellet
 berries: i wanna get something going before i add any path finding
 BenjaminUrquhart: bruh
 thethiny: make sure you're not doing an infinite loop
 thethiny: what's your algorithm for highest adjacent?
 thethiny: is it recursive or not?
 NapTown: pick a random pellet and go there, until you get it running
 thethiny: yup
 berries: okay so i think the im getting a problem with my grid when im adding edges 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I wouldn't mind of you had an infinite loop personally, less competition&#160;;)
 thethiny: 😂
 berries: trust me dude, you dont 
 berries: i just wanna eat like 3 pellets
 berries: Standard Error Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b713a07-ab23-4388-b719-42c2e92ad7dc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b713a07-ab23-4388-b719-42c2e92ad7dc</a>
 berries: thats my errors 
 thethiny: bruh
 NapTown: that might be your problem
 thethiny: your error is simple
 thethiny: x+i&#160;% width
 thethiny: y+i %height
 thethiny: you forgot this
 berries: yeah i did the wrapping i thought but maybe i did it wrong ill go back and check
 VicHofs: yo guys
 thethiny: sup
 VicHofs: I keep getting weird timeouts
 VicHofs: for apparently no reason at all
 VicHofs: anyone else getting this?
 thethiny: I haven't ran for a while
 VicHofs: Is there any way to tell what part of my program was running at those points?
 VicHofs: that at least could tell me whether it's a glitch or not
 thethiny: what language
 berries: still the same error
 BobLaserShark: For the pod racing challenge, does anyone know if it just uses a simple F = ma where the direction of the acceleration vector is determined by the steering output?
 VicHofs: Python thethiny
 thethiny: @berries the error clearly says that you have out of bound array at line 275 and 173
 VicHofs: BobLaserShark the what
 berries: yeah but im not sure why. like my arrays should all be big enough thethiny
 thethiny: @VicHofs print("I am here", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 thethiny: @BobLaserShark Sorry we're not in that Challenge so we can't help you, you can try in #PodRacingChallenge
 thethiny: but I don't believe anyone is in haha
 BobLaserShark: @VicHofs It's The Coders Strike Back
 thethiny: @berries it's not an array issue, it is indexing issue
 VicHofs: @thethiny I'll try that
 VicHofs: @BobLaserShark is it Physics themed or something? sounds dope to me lol
 BobLaserShark: It's pod racing. You specify the direction to steer and the thrust of the pod
 NapTown: try this challenge bob, since it's going on right now
 VicHofs: oh
 VicHofs:&#160;:(
 BenjaminUrquhart: BobLaserShark -3vel until gold
 BenjaminUrquhart: once you get gold you get more information for your physics stuff
 ChooJeremy: @berries you need (x + 1)&#160;% width
 BobLaserShark: Ok. I was hoping to implement a slightly better path finding algorithm than just "Point and pray." Do I really not get any velocity info until gold?
 ChooJeremy: otherwise the 1&#160;% width gets computed first so it becomes x + 
 ChooJeremy: 1
 BenjaminUrquhart: BobLaserShark position-previous position
 BenjaminUrquhart: do it for both x and y axis
 BenjaminUrquhart: tada, vx and vy
 BobLaserShark: @BenjaminUrquhart Already there&#160;:)
 Yitzhakpro: any ideas how can i get my pacs not to stuck each other?
 VicHofs: do a check for previous position being equal to the current one and scatter the pacs if so
 VicHofs: @ Yitzhakpro
 VicHofs: That's a pretty basic way to get you started anyway
 Yitzhakpro: @VicHofs  what do you mean by sayin: scatter the pacs
 VicHofs: well you could do it in more than one way
 Yitzhakpro: hmm, ok
 VicHofs: I'd recommend starting with changing their destination to random points at first
 VicHofs: then go from there
 Yitzhakpro: k bro thx
 VicHofs: np
 thethiny: if you're calculating the path
 thethiny: then check if path[i] of this pac == path[i[ of that pack
 eulerscheZahl: i'll say hi before chat crashes again
 Icebox: :wave:
 Gonny: BenjaminUrquhart any guesses as to why the chat keeps crashing?
 eulerscheZahl: maxime said the reason, no need to guess
 Gonny: oh?
 VicHofs: Automaton2000 knows why
 eulerscheZahl: We have an issue with a certificate renewal process which tries again every day. Fixing that bug wasn't a priority because we still have a while before the affected certificates expire. However, the chat do not like to see its certificate updated and simply stops. That's why it is stopped in the morning.
 Automaton2000: so you need to be fixed
 Gonny: ty
 VicHofs: anyone know an effective way to time code sections in python other than using datetime?
 VicHofs: as to avoid timeouts
 BenjaminUrquhart: by using code
 VicHofs: thanks I didn't think of that BenjaminUrquhart
 VicHofs: I might try writing some on a pc instead of this piece of paper too
 Icebox: @VicHofs use profilers
 Icebox: they show how much ms every part of your code is taking
 VicHofs: I'll see if I can make it work like that ty
 VicHofs: @Icebox
 Icebox: or do you mean measuring bot time in game?
 VicHofs: no just runtime
 Icebox: yeah, for debugging purposes profilers are insanely nice
 thethiny: I didn't get your question VicHofs

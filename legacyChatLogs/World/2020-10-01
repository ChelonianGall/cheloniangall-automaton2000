 Tiki69: hey can some help me with this question? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codechef.com/UCDS2020/problems/MIDLE001">https://www.codechef.com/UCDS2020/problems/MIDLE001</a>
 Tiki69: i have done first task
 Tiki69: didn't able to figure out the second teask
 Tiki69: task*
 N_Flamel: teask lol
 Maxi235678: moin
 AntiSquid: tsk tsk
 AntiSquid: languages: .... SQL, .... SQLQ i wonder what SQLQ is can't find it online
 Phurinat: SQLQ&#160;??
 AntiSquid: oh found it, SQL execution query
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pypi.org/project/sqlq/0.0.3/">https://pypi.org/project/sqlq/0.0.3/</a>
 AntiSquid: at least i think this is what it refers to&#160;?!
 N_Flamel: c++ is so bad for short code challenges
 N_Flamel:&#160;:(
 Eragon_09: yes saME
 N_Flamel: ikr
 NotAshura: yep
 Tiki69: java is more bad for short chaalenges than cpp
 Eragon_09: yes as a inforamtik professor i can agree
 N_Flamel: if we're going this way assembly is worst
 jacek: good morning
 N_Flamel: It's morning?
 jacek: eeyup
 N_Flamel: Lol where do you live
 gsomix: good morning, jacek
 gsomix: Automaton2000, good morning too
 Automaton2000: i'm not sure how much time does it take to get a good rank
 N_Flamel: What's your rank
 jacek: Automaton2000 how long have you been awake
 Automaton2000: at the start of the contest
 jacek: thats long
 N_Flamel: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 nxnjitsu: your mum is long
 jacek: why do i only see familiar faces in the penguis on wood1 league :v
 AntiSquid: that's a low blow nxnjitsu
 WeisstduwasIchMeine: hello for everyone
 jrke: whats the response time for Tron battle per turn
 nxnjitsu: your mum
 Uljahn: nxnjitsu: you've been warned, stop it or you'll get kicked/banned
 Q12: Finally!!! solved Bender - Episode 1 after hours of debugging :grinning:
 DomiKo: Episode 4 is waiting for you 
 jrke: let him do ep 2 else he won't understand story of ep 4&#160;;)
 EricSMSO: Hi jacek. Because there are only 13 players in penguins at the present time. I hope some more people will join soon
 jacek: for most part i was alone in wood2. not much for 3p 4p multiplayer there eh
 sunksuperset370: any one know how to do coders strike back
 sunksuperset370: i am using javascript
 sunksuperset370: i am in wood 2 league
 PurCHES5: I'm trying to do my first hard puzzle:thinking:
 PurCHES5: the labyrinth
 sunksuperset370: for coders strike back?
 sunksuperset370: oh
 PurCHES5: sunksuperset370 i'm stuck at bronze
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i didn't do labrinth i think
 PurCHES5: but wood 2 you just need to follow the hint
 PurCHES5: i forgot what that was
 sunksuperset370: just take a look

 sunksuperset370: hhhmmm
 PurCHES5: cant either
 sunksuperset370: i don't know what the problem is
 Q12: There is problem with the paste bin.
 Q12: Try paste your code here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY">https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY</a>
 sunksuperset370: hhhm
 Q12: see it
 sunksuperset370: i did
 Q12: PurCHES5 you can see it now in the link
 sunksuperset370: thanks
 sunksuperset370: for the help
 Q12: :thumbsup:
 PurCHES5: ok thx
 sunksuperset370: i still lose even though the enemy's output is the same too
 sunksuperset370: thrust 100
 sunksuperset370: the x and y are the same too
 sunksuperset370: :thinking:
 sunksuperset370: :head_bandage:
 Q12: I don't know the puzzle but I will try to help you
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i will share the link to the play for the current code
 Q12: ok
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/490337233">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/490337233</a>
 sunksuperset370: see it now
 Uljahn: thrust 100 is too much when you need to make a hard turn
 sunksuperset370: i think there is too much speed
 sunksuperset370: i even tried to lower the speed
 sunksuperset370: but the think is then too slow
 sunksuperset370: it is some where is 95 - 100
 sunksuperset370: but none of those work either
 PurCHES5: sunksuperset370 u just need to cut the thrust when angle is too large
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: lets try that
 PurCHES5: just an if statement
 PurCHES5: will solve that
 sunksuperset370: ok thx
 sunksuperset370: problem
 sunksuperset370: look at that code
 sunksuperset370: purCHESS
 sunksuperset370: the code on the link
 PurCHES5: there's just replay
 sunksuperset370: it is telling me that i didn't provide input lines in due time
 PurCHES5: no code
 sunksuperset370: no the code link
 sunksuperset370: the other link
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY">https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY</a>
 PurCHES5: ok i see
 sunksuperset370: any idea
 sunksuperset370: i think it is because the variable isn
 sunksuperset370: t a sting
 sunksuperset370: string
 PurCHES5: i forgot the question actually
 sunksuperset370: i think i might need to use arrays
 sunksuperset370: what i needed to do was to change the gthrust when the angle is too much
 PurCHES5: did the question mention that there are more inputs?
 sunksuperset370: no
 sunksuperset370: only
 sunksuperset370: three
 sunksuperset370: x and y and thrust
 sunksuperset370: thrust is supposed to be a stink
 sunksuperset370: sting
 sunksuperset370: string
 Uljahn: try this: if angle &gt; 90 or angle &lt; -90 (for both angle directions)
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Uljahn: thrust = 0 else thrust = 100
 sunksuperset370: thrust 0 just stops the pod
 Uljahn: no
 PurCHES5: no he says the program throws an error
 PurCHES5: not the solution
 sunksuperset370: yes
 Uljahn: thrust is accelerations not velocity
 sunksuperset370: its the speed of the pod
 Uljahn: ok
 Uljahn: im in legend league btw
 sunksuperset370: we don't get velocity this early in the puzzle
 sunksuperset370: i am still a wood 2
 PurCHES5: :disappointed: I stuck in bronze for a while and dont want to do it anymore
 sunksuperset370: labrint right
 sunksuperset370: i think i might need to change the final thrust var to an array var
 PurCHES5: i knew that i could make the code more complex and will surely pass that but i just feel its not worth the time
 sunksuperset370: ok
 PurCHES5: like i always stuck at around 100th
 PurCHES5: sometimes it gets higher
 sunksuperset370: turn
 PurCHES5: sometimes lower
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: hundredth turn
 PurCHES5: sunk when turning use 0 thrust
 PurCHES5: and use 100 thrust when angle is lower than like 20 or 15
 PurCHES5: i don't think u need an array?
 sunksuperset370: the problem is that thrust needs to be a string
 sunksuperset370: rather than a value
 sunksuperset370: the number value needs to be a string value
 PurCHES5: then convert it into a string?
 sunksuperset370: take a look at the code i put in the link
 PurCHES5: i dont understand
 PurCHES5: what was that
 PurCHES5: the array is totally unnecessary
 sunksuperset370: ok any idea how to turn it into a string
 MadKnight: sunksuperset370 what lang&#160;?
 PurCHES5: toString()
 PurCHES5: js i think?
 sunksuperset370: yes
 sunksuperset370: js
 MadKnight: just"text " + 100
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: can you make changes to the link
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY">https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY</a>
 MadKnight: why did u not put a whitespace in between numbers
 MadKnight: ohh there's too much js magic in this code
 sunksuperset370: the space in the console . log to because we need to have a space to log the next indo
 sunksuperset370: info
 eulerscheZahl: i updated your codeshare
 sunksuperset370: you mean reload the site
 sunksuperset370: i did
 sunksuperset370: what do i do now
 eulerscheZahl: read the comment next to your print statement
 sunksuperset370: what do i do about that?
 Metanoob: I think the idea is to reorganize your numbers  so that they don't contain whitespace and only format them with whitespace once you print them... amirite @eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: ' 50'[0]this takes the first character of a string. So you only have a whitespace and the 50 is lost
 sunksuperset370: check the link again
 sunksuperset370: i made some changes in the if statement
 eulerscheZahl: ok, that will work too (without the [0])
 eulerscheZahl: but for readability and such i'd still recommend to convert it to a string only when printing
 eulerscheZahl: keep it as a number before
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: the value will only change it the if statement is true
 sunksuperset370: not when it is not true
 sunksuperset370: one of the three statement will always be true
 sunksuperset370: hold up will be bace in 5 mins
 sunksuperset370: back
 eulerscheZahl: then have a look at the format strings that Metanoob showed you
 Q12: I have a problem in CoC right now "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session"
 Q12: What to do?
 Q12: I can't test my code
 B-612: +1
 B-612: i couldnt submti my code
 B-612: test actually
 Q12: I submit know and it just stack and after a while give me 0 score but I am sure I am right because I did the game already
 B-612: +1
 B-612: we was the same loby bro
 Q12: Yeah we are in the same clash
 B-612: y i was solved like 1.5 min 
 B-612: and couldnt solve the problem
 MadKnight: Q12  "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session"goes away itself in 2min
 B-612: actually coudlnt test
 B-612: i mean 
 B-612: i was got 100% solve rate 
 B-612: sad

 MadKnight: wanna play some russian competition&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: unless it's RAIC i'm not interested
 sunksuperset370: sorry it took time to come back
 AntiSquid: i don't see the big profile update

 AntiSquid:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: what is that hexoban site euler? sokoban with hex?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and no: i won't port it
 eulerscheZahl: not that's i'm scared about hex, just not different enough to justify a new contribution
 eulerscheZahl: and i already see sokoban pending for weeks if not months
 AntiSquid: MadKnight i probably play the next unofficial contest for fun instead ... but what contest is that russian one

 NNekros: 5.10.135.106 its a ip of nasa
 AntiSquid: would have liked to try the analytics one
 NNekros: 5.10.135.106 of nasa bitches
 AntiSquid: CG chat is contracted with nasa to kick trolls, it pays CG 100$ per kick
 NNekros: mother fuker
 eulerscheZahl: well done squiddy
 AntiSquid: i didn't kick, CG lost 100$
 eulerscheZahl: reading the CG newsletter for a moment
 eulerscheZahl: switching back and BAM
 professional_dumbass: what's the minimum age for playing?
 professional_dumbass: hopefully above 12
 professional_dumbass: otherwise im done for
 AntiSquid: solve puzzles then you'll know
 AntiSquid: CG has an integrated AI that recognizes gestures and type speed and can asses your age based on that alone
 Brevis: what gestures?
 professional_dumbass: wait wut
 professional_dumbass: that's cool
 Brevis: idk I guess that was supposed to be a joke? But I don't get it even if it was a joke..
 AntiSquid: mouse gestures
 Brevis: (before CG detects that Brevis is 2 years old)
 professional_dumbass: lol, dont captcha use mouse gestures too?
 AntiSquid: was a joke . being in funny mood .
 professional_dumbass: ok lol
 AntiSquid: no age restriction, but hey you can teach your kids to code from an early age eh&#160;?
 professional_dumbass: im a kid
 Brevis: coding p r o d i g y to be exact
 AntiSquid: that's alright professional_dumbass, have fun
 professional_dumbass: thanks, you too!
 professional_dumbass: how are your ranks the same after years?
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place.
 Automaton2000: and i don't know when to use it
 Brevis: professional_dumbass how did you solve that problem so quick!! Have you solved it before?
 Brevis: frog leaping thing
 professional_dumbass: nope
 professional_dumbass: see the pattern
 professional_dumbass: i checked all the tests
 professional_dumbass: i divided 143/11 got 12, 120/10 = 12, so basically found a pattern that you multiply n*(n+2)
 professional_dumbass: *got 13 sry
 Brevis: :anguished:
 professional_dumbass: i would have solved it in 10 seconds if i solved before lmao
 Brevis: bruh.. you solved it in 1 minute.. that's impressive..
 professional_dumbass: thanks
 professional_dumbass: if you get these type of questions, there probably is a pattern
 icecream17: I discovered in bug in contribution comments
 icecream17: if you repeatedly click upvote very fast, you can artificially increase the numbers of upvotes by more than 1
 professional_dumbass: wait wut?
 icecream17: like this: click click (+2) click (-1) click click (+2)
 icecream17: infinite upvotes
 MadKnight: does it still work after u refresh page&#160;?
 icecream17: i dont think so... it went from 26 to 3
 AntiSquid: wow it works icecream17
 icecream17: its awesome
 AntiSquid: same for downvotes lol
 icecream17: hmmm, is it possible to
 icecream17: get overflow
 AntiSquid: just user side bug though
 icecream17: with an autoclicker i got up to 385, so it probably doesn't overflow
 icecream17: wow, i got 1st in wood 3
 MadKnight: &gt;  i dont think so... it went from 26 to 3 then it's a visual bug icecream17 u can achieve the same with browser developer tools on f12
 professional_dumbass: inspect element lol
 professional_dumbass: i used to do that to show my friends i had 1 billion subs on youtube lmao
 sunksuperset370: can someone help me
 sunksuperset370: for coders strike back
 sunksuperset370: i am using js
 sunksuperset370: wood 2 league
 icecream17: wht do you need help on
 sunksuperset370: take a look at the coee
 sunksuperset370: code
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY">https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY</a>
 MadKnight: didn't we fix your code 2h ago&#160;?
 MadKnight:  // note the whitespace here
 icecream17: is there an error?
 MadKnight: there's even a comment explaining the problem
 sunksuperset370: there is an error
 icecream17: what does the error say
 sunksuperset370: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time... sunksuperset370 will no longer be active in this game.
 icecream17: ok, that means your code didn't do output
 icecream17: so it probably broke before that
 sunksuperset370: yes that is the problem
 icecream17: what do you think could be wrong
 icecream17: oh by the way, there are a bunch of ^^^^ after than console.log
 sunksuperset370: i think it is in the if statement
 professional_dumbass: i have no idea about js
 icecream17: okay, now press F12 and try your if statement,
 professional_dumbass: but why is your else indented like that
 sunksuperset370: hold on
 icecream17: or try it here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jsconsole.com/">https://jsconsole.com/</a>
 icecream17: if (5 &gt; 90 or 5 &lt;- 90)
 icecream17: oh well, if you found it congrats
 icecream17: but anyways
 icecream17: the correct if is:
 sunksuperset370: no wait
 icecream17: ok
 sunksuperset370: i am in class right now
 sunksuperset370: be back in a little while.
 professional_dumbass: so what was the problem?
 rradarr: it might be a noob think to ask this here, since you guys are talking about competitive programming, but could anyone help me with C++ MIME Type puzzle?&#160;:/ I've been stuck on the Large dataset for 3 days now
 icecream17: &lt;or&gt; doesn't existalso "5 &lt;- 90" was converted into "5 &lt; -90", but what was probably really meant was "5 &lt;= 90"
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/arD8Jz">https://codeshare.io/arD8Jz</a>, here you go sunksuper, a good explanation
 professional_dumbass: lol
 professional_dumbass: such a simple problem
 professional_dumbass: but didn't come to my mind
 sparky: rradarr do you have a timeout or the wrong answer?
 rradarr: timeout
 rradarr: from what i've read on the forum it could be bugged?
 sparky: it's ok for me - are you looping through all the types when checking?
 rradarr: I'm using a hash table with a slightly modified djb2 that gives me ~70% fill and max of 6 entries in a bucket
 rradarr: *about 70% fill (~ &lt;- this should be tilde)
 sparky: hmm that was the obvious thing to do wrong (not use a hash)
 sparky: copy the test case and try it locally
 rradarr: not shure how I should try it locally, copied the code to vs and once the console opened i just rightclick to copy the testcase. it takes about 15 seconds
 sparky: ah, well that is too slow - you'll have to speed things up
 sparky: typically it's 1 second for tests I think
 rradarr: oh wow
 rradarr: okay
 rradarr: how do I shave off that much time xd
 Drakkhonian: man, imma sound like a noob rn
 rradarr: in the browser it takes about 1 second and the whole output seems to be printed because the end of testcase correct output is the same as mine
 Drakkhonian: but im kinda stuck on the counting squares logic
 Drakkhonian: its an easy problem too, embarassing
 icecream17: i think easy problems are harder than easy too
 rradarr: I just passed the MIME once and immedietly after failed without changing anything&#160;:/
 MadKnight: with what error?
 rradarr: same, timed out
 rradarr: maybe i'm on the edge of the time constrain and got lucky once
 MadKnight: wanna show me your code&#160;?
 rradarr: yes, I would apreciate if you looked at it&#160;:)
 Aaronthebaron: o
 Drakkhonian: ok, finally did the square counting one, im not sure mathematically what i did tho
 codehacker123: hi
 Schwase: drak which puzzle?
 Drakkhonian: rectangle partitioin, easy one
 Drakkhonian: partition*
 codehacker123: :kissing_heart:
 Drakkhonian: im actually gonna ahve to study my own code to know exactly why it effing works, and in time too
 Schwase: ohhh
 Schwase: good puzzlew
 Schwase: you can just brute force it however
 Schwase: satisfying to solve indeed
 Drakkhonian: i mean, now i understand why it works, and i dunno if theres a way to solve it without "brute forcing"
 Drakkhonian: and now i know i actually made a mistake in the right direction when solving it
 Schwase: there might ways to improve it but at the end of the day it still would be "brute force" even if it is limited  or reduced somehow
 Drakkhonian: ya, i was able to limit the number of searches in list to one search for each possible case
 Drakkhonian: but its still sorta brute force
 Drakkhonian: but yeah, fun one
 Drakkhonian: tho kinda annoying when you test a code just to see the next error and then it suddenly works perfectly
 Drakkhonian: and you dont know why
 TheCodeKid123: Hey!!!!!!!!
 TheCodeKid123: lol
 TheCodeKid123: How are yall
 TheCodeKid123: lol
 Drakkhonian: pretty good, having fun, you?
 icecream17: im amazing, my tic tac toe bot beat random 99 times a drew twice
 LoganBTW: i'm new
 icecream17: i wonder, how many of everyone is new
 icecream17: i actually joined this year

 zainul1995: how to solve mars lander 1
 MadKnight: with ifs
 BenCrossley: How should I think about the 7-segment scanner?
 Uljahn: BenCrossley: is the puzzle statement unclear for you?
 Majeck: I just finished the weekly puzzle without looking the answer up and I feel like a literal GOD
 Majeck: Programming highs definitely make up for the lows
 BenCrossley:  It's clear, I'm just not sure on how to go about my implementation
 Uljahn: i guess you should implement sort of a character recognition system by comparing the input with ascii arts of digits
 Uljahn: maybe you should solve ASCII ART puzzle first if you haven't done it yet
 Bennyboi: Okay, yeah I'm new. Trying to figure out the sequence of progression
 Bennyboi: What do I do when I'm just totally stuck on a puzzle? 
 Uljahn: skip it
 pardouin: you can use a dict that associate each string to its digit
 pardouin: for example " _ | ||_|" to 0
 LastRick: Hey, don't give it all away!&#160;:)
 Bennyboi: Yeah I had some ideas like that
 zainul1995: give me solution of mars lander 1 plz
 Uljahn: also there are different kinds of puzzles: some are created by staff (has no author specified) and by community (with an author), i'd recommend to solve the former first (they are called classic puzzles)
 Uljahn: zainul1995: look for the Hints button on the left
 zainul1995: it doesnt help me lot..
 Majeck: @Uljahn some puzzles have hints?
 Uljahn: very few
 pardouin: zain if it lands too fast try to give less speed from time to time
 LastRick: Sometimes you might find a hint in the Discussion tab or search for the community page of the puzzle
 zainul1995: solved it bro thanks 
 Majeck: Just wanna thank whoever did the weekly puzzle, it was really fun and I skipped two classes to solve it lol
 Schwase: oh whats PoW?
 Majeck: Goblin Lake
 Majeck: Or I guess in this case "Escape the Cat"
 Majeck: Here's a Code Parade video about it: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0V3LMK40iI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0V3LMK40iI</a>

 sunksuperset370: can any one help
 sunksuperset370: just so you know i use javascript :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 sunksuperset370: you can look at my code currently on this link <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY">https://codeshare.io/5XzjNY</a>
 sunksuperset370: any ideas?
 jthemphill: sharing code in contests is against the rules
 sunksuperset370: uuuummmmm
 sunksuperset370: :grimacing:
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 sunksuperset370: but i do need help here
 sunksuperset370: i didn't put the code there yet
 jthemphill: you can ask questions, but we probably won't look at your code if you link it
 sunksuperset370: the link doesn't go to my code
 sunksuperset370: its a whole totaly different site
 sunksuperset370: like google docs except for coding
 sunksuperset370: just so you know i didn't put my code there so i am good
 sunksuperset370: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 jthemphill: i mean nobody's going to disqualify you, dw
 jthemphill: especially since CSB is a really old contest
 sunksuperset370: i was to say that too
 jthemphill: but it also means we also won't look at your code to give pointers :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 sunksuperset370: but i figured it was best if i didn't
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 sunksuperset370: i get it
 sunksuperset370: no cheating on the test
 sunksuperset370: even if it is old
 sunksuperset370: :innocent:
 sunksuperset370: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 sunksuperset370: lol
 sunksuperset370: i do need help though
 sunksuperset370: can you take a look at my play through though
 jthemphill: link the replay?
 bajosi: hello
 sunksuperset370: yes
 username09128347: what is this chat used for?
 sunksuperset370: linking the repleay
 sunksuperset370: um to talk to others and ask for help
 username09128347: would I specify the name of the puzzle or is this chat puzzle specific?
 sunksuperset370: no it is n't puzzle specific
 sunksuperset370: i am on coders strike back
 sunksuperset370: right now
 sunksuperset370: just take a look here
 username09128347: oh yeah I just signed up today to learn C. I already know the concepts of programming in general like functions, loops, etc. I think I am on a too easy level. How do I change it?
 sunksuperset370: you can't
 sunksuperset370: you have to go up with the levels
 sunksuperset370: like from scratch to art
 jthemphill: okay found one of your replays: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/490472129">https://www.codingame.com/replay/490472129</a>
 sunksuperset370: no not that one
 sunksuperset370: this one
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/490473823">https://www.codingame.com/replay/490473823</a>
 jthemphill: oh, well the boss is using boost and you aren't
 jthemphill: you're beating the boss on turn 50, then the boss boosts past you
 sunksuperset370: i k
 sunksuperset370: problem
 sunksuperset370: it depends on the layout of the map
 sunksuperset370: i only use the boost if the least amount of dist to the next checkpoint of 5000
 sunksuperset370: every single time i press play code the lay out changes
 jthemphill: there's a button to replay with the same conditions
 sunksuperset370: and the boost is messed up
 sunksuperset370: i know that
 sunksuperset370: but i don't want to do that
 sunksuperset370: i want to code to be ever changing
 sunksuperset370: like something challanging
 sunksuperset370: at least when i know how to set the thing up
 sunksuperset370: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 jthemphill: the reason you'd replay in the same conditions is to debug
 sunksuperset370: ok
 jthemphill: like, answer the question "why didn't i boost at turn 35 in that replay?"
 jthemphill: because i think you'd want to boost on turn 35 there
 sunksuperset370: i think i might just end up changing the least dist to 4000
 sunksuperset370: that is what i have estimated
 jthemphill: yeah, and then redo that replay under the same conditions to see if you boost there
 jthemphill: the other thing is i think you only ever turn to the right, even if you want to go left
 jthemphill: oh, no, you do a left turn there
 s1ph0n: Is there a faster way for me to let my stuff run in the arena?
 sunksuperset370: uum
 sunksuperset370: what is your question exactly
 s1ph0n: I don't fully understand how to actually resister when I rank over the "boss"
 s1ph0n: *register
 s1ph0n: As in
 s1ph0n: do I just wait for it to say something
 sunksuperset370: win?
 s1ph0n:&#160;?
 s1ph0n: Yeah win basically
 s1ph0n: Do I just have to wait, cause it says I am ranked 1, do I just wait?
 sunksuperset370: so you have to wait in the arena and where it says your rank in the current league
 jthemphill: @s1ph0n yes you have to wait
 sunksuperset370: there will then be a timer
 s1ph0n: Where do I find the timer?
 sunksuperset370: when the time goes down to 0 after 2 sec to get purmote
 s1ph0n: Is it the battles in progress bar?
 sunksuperset370: where it says your rank on the top middle
 sunksuperset370: it should change if you stay rank one for enought ime
 sunksuperset370: time
 s1ph0n: I don't see anything, I'm just vibing at rank one, wait now it is doing something
 s1ph0n: I see it just takes a while
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 sunksuperset370: if your internet is slow it takes some time
 sunksuperset370: or maybe its something else
 HungryBurger: You'll see something like "Those better than the Boss will be promoted to Silver League at 19 H 12"
 HungryBurger: That would mean 19:12 (or 7:12pm).
 jthemphill: yeah promotions happen at set times throughout the day
 s1ph0n: My league is very low so I guess it happens quicker
 sunksuperset370: yes
 sunksuperset370: it takes time to get registered before you get the timer
 sunksuperset370: so when you think the timer is 00
 sunksuperset370: log back in or reload the site you should get pormoted
 s1ph0n: Yeah I see I got promoted
 s1ph0n: It just took a bit
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 sunksuperset370: what puzzle are you on
 sunksuperset370: like the name
 s1ph0n: I'm doing the collisions now
 s1ph0n: Just reached it
 sunksuperset370: oh
 sunksuperset370: what league
 sunksuperset370: bronze
 s1ph0n: Bronze
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 s1ph0n: yup
 sunksuperset370: i am really low on the rank right now
 sunksuperset370: 21,485
 sunksuperset370: now it says 20,033
 s1ph0n: I am also very low rank
 sunksuperset370: i was at something about 14000 when i clicked play in arena and i got dowm
 sunksuperset370: down
 sunksuperset370: i need to figure out what i need to do to win
 sunksuperset370: the most biggest problem i am at is the collision
 sunksuperset370: they are the things that are messing me up
 sunksuperset370: like just when i am about to win the other guy pushes me off course and wins
 sunksuperset370: i need to do something about that
 sunksuperset370: any ideas
 sunksuperset370: can i just show the code i have currently please
 sunksuperset370: :disappointed_relieved:
 s1ph0n: sorry broski against the rules
 sunksuperset370: please
 s1ph0n: maybe take a break and come back later
 sunksuperset370: pretty please
 sunksuperset370: its 10:00 pm right now here
 s1ph0n: Then head to bed and come back tomorrow
 sunksuperset370: so if i take a break i am on bed
 sunksuperset370: i need to wake up at 5:30 am
 s1ph0n: Go to sleep and come back tomorrow when you have time
 sunksuperset370: i need to go to school too
 s1ph0n: You'll be able to think about it better then
 sunksuperset370: i think i do best when i am awake and don't want to go to bed
 sunksuperset370: just take a look at the code then tell me any thing that i can get better at
 sunksuperset370: don't tell me suggestions but tell me what i can change
 sunksuperset370: not what i can change it o
 sunksuperset370: to
 sunksuperset370: please
 s1ph0n: You're starting to annoy me bro, I suggested what to do, if you don't want to do it then don't bug me
 sunksuperset370: oooppps
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 sunksuperset370: i better get going then
 s1ph0n: Have a good night
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: bye
 s1ph0n: byezzz
 sunksuperset370: sorry for being annoying
 sunksuperset370: gn
 s1ph0n: Just do better next time broski
 s1ph0n: is all good
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: another question sorry
 sunksuperset370: what language do you use to code
 vladov200: We've all been there, its tough when code doesn't work and you don't see why
 sunksuperset370: yes that is common in people who dream to be software engineers
 sunksuperset370: like me
 sunksuperset370: but what lang do you use
 sunksuperset370: siphon what lang do you sue
 sunksuperset370: use
 sunksuperset370: python 
 sunksuperset370: java
 sunksuperset370: javascript
 sunksuperset370: c+
 sunksuperset370: c++
 sunksuperset370: hello?
 sunksuperset370: siphon?
 sunksuperset370: please answer
 sunksuperset370: ok fine i am leaving
 sunksuperset370: byes
 s1ph0n: soz I was afk doing some stuff, c#
 Saaalikh: nrhh
 s1ph0n: I agree
 s1ph0n: I might be struggling just a tad with actually getting ahead of the competition in the bronze league (the collisions one), it doesn't feel like I have to change anything or check for anything regarding my opponents position, but it feels like I definitely have to change something if I want to pull ahead of the other people in the league
 s1ph0n: I can't for the life of me though get what it is
 s1ph0n: hmmmmmm
 DrinkeeCrow: How the fuck are any of these puzzles for beginners?

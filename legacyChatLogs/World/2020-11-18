 phord: I can't stop working on this for more than a couple of hours because my code is so full of spaghetti I'll forget how any of it works.
 ClockSort: :spaghetti:
 F0lio: idk if im the only one who suffer from the console size, why not more flexibility in size adjustment.
 Icebox: just use local IDE
 F0lio: yeah, that's what i do
 F0lio: but.. 
 useAllTheThings: the console output, would be nice if there was an easy way to resize it without taking up the entire vertical view
 JamesOConnor: Is there anyway to get the inputs they give?
 JamesOConnor: so as to test on a local ide?
 Icebox: or you could copy the referee
 JamesOConnor: how do I get the referee?
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020">https://github.com/CodinGame/FallChallenge2020</a>
 jrke: ^^ refree
 JamesOConnor: ah
 JamesOConnor: do they do that for all games?
 jrke: yup
 Xenoid: yeah
 jrke: everygame is having refree
 JamesOConnor: I mean do they release the referee code for all games
 jrke: yes
 Icebox: yes
 JamesOConnor: where would I find the one for ghost in the cell?
 Icebox: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/ghost-in-the-cell">https://github.com/CodinGame/ghost-in-the-cell</a>
 JamesOConnor: thanks
 jrke: JamesOCornnor just goto this link - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame">https://github.com/CodinGame</a> you will nearly every refree code here
 JamesOConnor: Thank you, it was very painful to try and debug my code on the codingame system
 ScriptKiddie0101: guys, what do you think about using random and getting 100% acceptance?
 ScriptKiddie0101: without time limit
 ClockSort: my arena submission is timing out, but it works fine in the Play My Code area
 ClockSort: any ideas?
 JamesOConnor: how much have you tested it in the play my code area
 ClockSort: 5 runs, all workd
 JamesOConnor: it might be that it is just not encountering that scenario
 ClockSort: 100% of them timeout in arena
 JamesOConnor: hm
 ClockSort: oh wow, the cause was C#'s [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
 ClockSort: i guess that plays differently in the arena somehow (Release vs Debug build, maybe?)
 ClockSort: anyway, now i know that cause. Thanks for the "hm"
 ClockSort: here was the cause: i have a prebuilt array of gamestates that i put my searched into. With this inlining flag, it searched so fast that it ran out and crashed "array out of bounds"
 ClockSort: easy to fix, just add some "sleep" statements :D
 Zenoscave: or more states....&#160;;)
 ClockSort: @zenoscave thank you so much for your c# garbage collection ideas. I'm now searching 500k nodes in 35ms in C# because of your help. I was about to give up and rebuild in C++ when you saved the project for me&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: clock sort wanna help me?
 ClockSort: any specific question?
 Zenoscave: I only get 20K max
 NinjaDoggy: 500k nodes? O.o
 NinjaDoggy: in 35 ms? o.O
 Zenoscave: Beam search level wise with an array having trouble
 ClockSort: everybody switch to C# now :laughing:
 NinjaDoggy: do you have a hashmap of some sort?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm hitting a wall&#160;:/
 NinjaDoggy: to track transpositions?
 Zenoscave: no
 NinjaDoggy: also... locally? or on codingame @ clocksort
 Zenoscave: lol NinjaDoggy if it was local it would still be impressive
 ClockSort: here's a random match from my submission. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504875554">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504875554</a>
 ClockSort: d is search depth, i'm doing full BFS on CAST and BREW.
 Zenoscave: Ok just need to figure out bfs with an array again
 NinjaDoggy: ok phew I panicked for nothing&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: I easily double the depth :P
 ClockSort: Ninja, do you trim somehow?
 Zenoscave: clocksort beam search
 NinjaDoggy: i do trim but
 NinjaDoggy: the result is the same as untrimmed
 NinjaDoggy: guarenteed!
 Zenoscave: Ninja you have perfect heuristic?
 NinjaDoggy: yes!
 Zenoscave: lies
 NinjaDoggy: will talk about in my write up&#160;;)
 Zenoscave: DP????
 Zenoscave: I can't wait
 Tanmay_105: hello
 ClockSort: i haven't decided how to trim yet
 NinjaDoggy: @eulerscheZahl want to talk strategy if you're stuck? :D
 NinjaDoggy: I've been thinking and working nonstop, despite low number of submission i swear&#160;;)
 ClockSort: my code still loads up on inventory though. ha. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504875722">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/504875722</a>
 ClockSort: what beam width do you use, ninjadoggy?
 NinjaDoggy: i don't beamsearch, it's plain bfs
 ClockSort: oh it's zenos doing beam
 Icebox: oh eulerscheZahl you're awake already
 Codeab: ?Icebox its in the afternoon
 hbouillo: The world is made of different timezones buddy
 Codeab: whoops
 eulerscheZahl: 6am afternoon, yes
 hbouillo: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i think my bot rests too much. but how to change?
 Gonny: NinjaDoggy you go to depth 15 and find the best path there? How are you not at least top 5?
 NinjaDoggy: because I don't have enemy sim
 NinjaDoggy: it's pure single play lol
 NinjaDoggy: so if we're both against afk bot, and we learn the same stuff
 NinjaDoggy: I'm almost confident my bot is stronger than top 5
 NinjaDoggy: but that's not the game&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: because lots of users can plan 15 turns ahead
 NinjaDoggy: also perfect shortest distance can be beaten by better heuristics
 NinjaDoggy: hey eulerscheZahl
 NinjaDoggy: you should make an optimization puzzle from this game :D
 eulerscheZahl: nah
 NinjaDoggy: given a set of tomes, and a fixed set of deliveries, shortest turns to do it&#160;;)
 DreadY2K: Anyone have tips for optimizing BFS? I can't get past 3 without timeout&#160;:(
 phord: How many candy pieces can I fit in my backpack?
 NinjaDoggy: 10
 ClockSort: @dreadY2K what language?
 DreadY2K: I think my bottleneck is copying an array, for the sequence of actions and for which spells are castable, at each step
 DreadY2K: But idk how to better optimize that
 ClockSort: make sure you aren't newing up and freeing a lot of memory in your core loop
 DreadY2K: @ClockSort I'm using Rust, but I think this isn't a language-specific thing
 DreadY2K: My core loop is using and freeing a bit of memory, to track the sequence of steps and which spells are castable at that moment
 DreadY2K: I'm just out of ideas for how to cut that out and avoid all those allocs and frees
 ClockSort: well that's probably what's slowing it down
 ClockSort: I newed up all my memory on turn 1 (you get 1000 ms) and then keep references to it at all times.
 raymoo: you should use some structure like an immutable linked list that would let you share path prefixes
 raymoo: then you don't need copying or quadratic memory
 phord: Will rust let you reuse parts of a pre-allocated pool?
 ClockSort: it's not a pool, it's just a giant static array...
 DreadY2K: Rust has some allocator stuff that you can change how it allocates memory, but idk how to work with that specifically
 ClockSort: i figure 2 million ought to be enough XD
 DreadY2K: I think I'll go with raymoo's idea and do a linked-list thing
 DreadY2K: That sounds easier than messing with how it allocs memory
 tomatoes: make queue on first turn then only clear
 ClockSort: that's more likely to get you a job
 ClockSort: if any employer saw my code they would probably vomit&#160;:)
 tomatoes: avoid heap/vec for small and tmp
 raymoo: if you want to mess with alloc while doing the linked list thing you could allocate the list nodes in a pool
 raymoo: not that I'm doing that
 phord: If I saw my code on a whiteboard interview, I wouldn't hire me.
 raymoo: and I dont' know rust so don't know how you would do that
 JamesOConnor: I have broken my code beyond repair&#160;:(
 DreadY2K: I could google how to do allocator stuff if I was sufficiently motivated
 phord: \o/ Time start over!
 DreadY2K: Language specifics are easy enough to research
 DreadY2K: But high-level algorithms are harder to search for, and a weaker point of mine
 DreadY2K: Hence my asking
 KevinisMAD: How are people dealing with the resting mechanic within the bfs or are y'all just ignoring it?
 eulerscheZahl: that's a valid move so it has to be included in the simulation
 DreadY2K: Yeah, rest is a move that's equal to casting any spell, etc
 jrke: REST becomes invalid when all of your CAST spells are castable
 ClockSort: i'm considering a RESt any time something isn't castable.
 DreadY2K: The optimal solution found by bfs (or fancier algs) wouldn't rest in that case, so you're safe from that
 ClockSort: maybe i should change it to require two things
 DreadY2K: Though it will slightly decrease fanout
 ClockSort: yeah, it helps your search when you 
 DreadY2K: So it's probably good for being faster
 KevinisMAD: Yeah that was what I am wrestling with. Adding it when I have found the path that okayish or trying to include it within my bfs
 KevinisMAD: that is okayish*
 hbouillo: ClockSort you might miss optimal solutions if you prevent a REST with only 1 spell used
 ClockSort: hbouillo i just wonder if it's worth it
 hbouillo: Unless you really have a performance issue I wouldn't. It could be quite common that you need to use the same spell twice in a row at the end of a path, for instance
 hbouillo: I didn't get a proper look at available spells, I'm pulling that assumption of frequency out of my *ss
 phord: I'm worried about it only because someone may consistently beat me to the brew I'm after.
 hbouillo: If you consider REST at the first used spell, you will never have a longer path than without considering it
 hbouillo: Assuming your algorithm finds you an optimal solution
 hbouillo: Only reason to increase the REST requirement is for performances
 hbouillo: time wise
 NinjaDoggy: *fingers crossed* finally top 20 again?
 NinjaDoggy: nvm it's still bugged&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i struggle to be the first toad <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vl82ea">https://prnt.sc/vl82ea</a>
 jrke: toad behind toad
 jrke: lol
 Whiskee: are there any gotchas I'm not aware of, using a c# Stopwatch?
 eulerscheZahl: i just realized psyho's pic shows to ears. I always thought something impaled one of his eyes
 Whiskee: I'm getting timeouts with less than 45 from last line in to console out
 eulerscheZahl: start the stopwatch after reading the first line of input
 eulerscheZahl: we all get occasional timeouts, something wrong on the CG end
 Whiskee: ah, I see, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: so it it's 1 in 10-20 matches, accept it. nothing else you can do
 eulerscheZahl: if it's*
 sadakatsu: I am currently timing out despite continuously increasing my safety margin  ~_~
 Icebox: saaaaaame  :/
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/504890582">https://www.codingame.com/replay/504890582</a>aaand I'll just resubmit
 Nabil-Hayek: why cant i view others code after clash is complete
 Icebox: because they haven't shared it
 Nabil-Hayek: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: because you are fighting against bots and those never share
 Icebox: shhhhhh
 Icebox: eulerscheZahl you just had to break the illusion
 Icebox: Spielverderber
 eulerscheZahl: let's call them shadows of previous times
 NinjaDoggy: How do I make my bot not give up&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: finally I got opponent sim working, but now if it finds that the opponent wins
 NinjaDoggy: it just gives up and plays random stuff&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: instead of hoping the opponent messes up and maximize points still&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i had a similar problem. disabled the opponent again now&#160;:/
 NinjaDoggy: also if my submit was 8/10
 NinjaDoggy: and i'm on 10 winstreak should i resub?
 eulerscheZahl: let it run
 NinjaDoggy: 8/10 -&gt; 15/17
 NinjaDoggy: not worth resub?
 eulerscheZahl: be patient
 NinjaDoggy: ok ok 
 NoobCod3: can somebody help me learn Python
 Icebox: did you read the tutorial NoobCod3?
 NoobCod3: i forgot
 dbf: I've read about timeouts, so implemented object pool in my code. I start to get timeouts, and was able to fix them only when object pool was removed&#160;:|
 NoobCod3: i will read tomorrow
 NoobCod3: because 11:15 for me in America
 eulerscheZahl: very long ago (coders of the caribbean) CG had a bug where you always timed out your first 10 games on submit
 NoobCod3: huh
 eulerscheZahl: a top10 bot barely reaching top100
 NoobCod3: wow
 ScriptKiddie0101: wow you are the top 1
 ScriptKiddie0101: you must have really high IQ
 eulerscheZahl: just high dedication
 ScriptKiddie0101: nice
 Westicles: He also has a high basketball IQ
 ScriptKiddie0101: how old are u
 ScriptKiddie0101: and since when do you code?
 dbf: for couple of hours today already I think?&#160;:)
 useAllTheThings: Can someone explain what's happening at turn 28 here

 NinjaDoggy: @eulerscheZahl, earlier you linked some game history -&gt; opponent conversion thing right?
 NinjaDoggy: can you link it again please?
 eulerscheZahl: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/?id=502157528">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/replays/reproduce/?id=502157528</a>
 ScriptKiddie0101: euler, hwo old are u
 eulerscheZahl: 29
 NinjaDoggy: yea, thanks
 NinjaDoggy: is there a way to generate input data from this?
 ScriptKiddie0101: with which age did u start coding
 ScriptKiddie0101:&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: without running it locally? :P
 eulerscheZahl: around 15
 eulerscheZahl: just print all the input to stderr
 ScriptKiddie0101: am i really going to impove here?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vl8hyc">https://prnt.sc/vl8hyc</a>then you have it in the replay info
 Icebox: ScriptKiddie0101 depends on how much time you're gonna put in
 ScriptKiddie0101: tthis shortest code mode isnt good practice
 eulerscheZahl: you can learn a lot here if you are willing to investigate on your own and follow your ideas. there isn't much handholding to guide you
 ScriptKiddie0101: i'm putting in like 8 hours  a day here xD
 ScriptKiddie0101: i'm addicted to this website
 Samer: is there a tutorial somewhere that explains how to set up a game locally for testing?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: noobcod3, private chat me... :disappointed:

 Samer: thanks eulerscheZahl
 sadakatsu: I am having severe timeout issues every single game now.
 ScriptKiddie0101: do people really get jobs because of this website?
 KevinisMAD: No idea but it is a fun way to practice skills used in interviews kinda sorta
 Samer: i just play for fun and to learn new stuff
 KevinisMAD: Same for me
 Samer: i'm an engineer, programming is not my career... it's a hobby
 KevinisMAD: Although I will say I do also just like tweaking algos it makes you have to learn it more than just taking a class or whatever
 DreadY2K: I just spent an hour trying to debug why my BFS wasn't working
 DreadY2K: It turns out, my BFS was fine
 DreadY2K: I just took the path to the LONGEST brew, instead of the shortest brew
 KevinisMAD: Haha
 DreadY2K: It did get me to re-write it as one BFS instead of one BFS per brew, which should be faster, so it's not a total loss
 DreadY2K: But that's still a bit annoying that I'd pull a bit like that
 Rodrigo_the_coder: CSB
 Westons_Dad: hello all. n00b here just getting started today and looking to learn python. any resources you can point me to would be great. i have familiarty with MATLAB, but thats more scientific programming. 
 DreadY2K: I first learned python by doing the Codecademy course. It's free, not too long, and gets you started with basic language familiarity
 DreadY2K: It doesn't get too deep into it, but it'll get you started
 Westons_Dad: ok thanks! I'll have to check that out too. 
 sadakatsu: Since you have a background in MATLAB, you might find a somewhat straightforward comparison in the comparisons between the languages by looking at tutorials for the matplotlib, numpy, and scipy Python packages.  You'll see stuff you probably used to do in Python syntax.
 sadakatsu: It's not a traditional approach, but it might give you a better feel for what's going on when you switch to more traditional Python tutorials.
 Uljahn: Westons_Dad: take a look at numpy and scipy packages for scientific python then
 Uljahn: oh the chat freezing again
 DreadY2K: Also, thanks to whoever it was that suggested I use a linked list instead of a vector for my BFS. I doubled my search horizon with this change.
 daffie: linked list that's totally what I was just thinking to use but wasn't sure thanks
 Whiskee: oh my god I spent minutes trying to figure out why the hell I got stuck with a full inventory
 Whiskee: and

 Augis123: hi
 Augis123: hello???
 LLG: I'm trying to check if REST is a valid move, then iterate through all of my learned spells and update their castable property to true.
 Augis123: IDK&#160;:)
 Icebox: is it really that costly?
 Icebox: I wouldve thought flipping one bool for like 10 spells shouldn't be a performance issue :D
 WINWINWIN: Are you somehow repeatedly going through the spell list?
 Q12: when gold league will be open?
 eulerscheZahl: in 9h
 Q12: thanks, I don't know what else to improve till then, I am stuck :pensive:
 Samer: eulerscheZahl still here?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Samer: oh ok
 Samer: :P
 eulerscheZahl: he's gone&#160;;)
 Samer: how did you resolve the missing manifest error when compiling the game?
 Samer: i've been fighting with this for an hour
 Samer: the only main i found is in Fall2020Main, and that runs on the game engine... i downloaded the game engine, but no idea if and how to combine it with the fall game
 Samer: i'm sure i'm missing something, or the code is missing a proper manifest
 eulerscheZahl: did you build it with maven?
 Samer: yes
 Samer: build was successful
 eulerscheZahl: tbh i never tried it run it outside of my IDE
 Samer: when trying to run it, i get the manifest error
 Samer: oh
 eulerscheZahl: good ol' IntelliJ
 LordSkaven: euler did you break your bot again?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so. others just get stronger
 eulerscheZahl: and submit is extremely slow again
 eulerscheZahl: "We'd like to apologize for the troubles we had with the game and the platform at the beginning of the challenge. Everything should be running smoothly now. "
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud lied to us!
 LordSkaven: I dont think I am going to submit before gold, unless I make a breakthrough
 eulerscheZahl: i don't submit before it gets faster again
 LordSkaven: one of the major things I still need to add is end game logic, i.e gaining more ingredients above tier0 at the end. I am losing quite a few games by 1 or 2 points because of that
 TheSpiffiest: Do I have to wait for arena submissions? Like is the judging happening on my PC, or is it on the server? I would rather do other stuff than watch the matches
 eulerscheZahl: happens on the server. but something is broken right now
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, you can close the tab and turn off your computer
 TheSpiffiest: Coool.  It's 4am here, just did a quick get out of wood league thing but I have to sleep
 TheSpiffiest: thank you
 raymoo: I left for 20 minutes and I got 5 battles since then
 raymoo: simply epioc
 Icebox: I could make another season of paranormal activity just by reviewing my code every episode ngl
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr reported it 1.5h ago. let's see when something will happen about it
 Joris_Serva: ka jus lopai
 Icebox: Joris_Serva that's bannable
 Icebox: refrain from insulting others on the chat
 eulerscheZahl: then do it Icebox&#160;;)
 Joris_Serva: raminkis
 eulerscheZahl: tell be when i should enter
 jrke: reported what euler?
 eulerscheZahl: the slow submits
 Icebox: Joris_Serva just because you assume noone understands what you're saying doesn't make it okay
 shroudo7: guys i use vs code and sync very good working. But i wanna see console output in my terminal. How can i do this? 
 Poviliukas: looks like arena simulations back on track
 eulerscheZahl: whee!
 Icebox: can we promote CG less
 Icebox: so that it doesn't die every contest?
 Icebox: Kappa
 jrke: no promote CG as much as you can
 eulerscheZahl: last time it went smoothly as far as i remember
 eulerscheZahl: might be related to their database upgrade from postgres 9 to 12
 eulerscheZahl: (just guessing)
 jrke: except on first day euler(spring challenge)
 eulerscheZahl: i already forgot about that. what happened?
 jrke: there was boom in starting few hours so battles became slow or stopped for some people
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i already went to bed at that time
 jrke: 20% battles in an hour in wood leagues
 LordSkaven: are submits better now?
 jrke: i think its better now
 WINWINWIN: I just checked, over 6000 people are participating, its fantastic&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: and only 20 tshirts
 jrke: and 3 canvases&#160;:(
 Jchenaud: ya des sort repeatable&#160;? si oui c'est quoi leur signe distinquetife dans la scene&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: finally back to top10. legend will be a hard fight for me&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: while my submit finishes, emil is still stuck
 jrke: legend opening will be top 20-40 i think
 eulerscheZahl: no :D
 jrke: it was 16 for spring challenge right?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't remember the exact number. but legend size usually is a fixed number and not a fraction
 CommanderCero: wait does that mean you can get kicked out
 eulerscheZahl: i also predict a small legend league (somehow that's how simulation contests usually turn out)
 eulerscheZahl: you can't get demoted
 eulerscheZahl: only go up
 jrke: but it turns 100 until end of contest
 eulerscheZahl: you may stay in the lower league and then have to beat the boss like you did for wood bosses
 wlesavo: submits alive again
 eulerscheZahl: emil still stuck
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr too
 eulerscheZahl: wait, dbdr is back
 jrke: 195 bots computing too many
 DomiKo: Is League boss fixed before the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: chosen on friday
 eulerscheZahl: some player code
 DomiKo: ohhhh
 DomiKo: so that's how it work's
 DomiKo: so they choose some place
 eulerscheZahl: CG has no time to write top level bots
 DomiKo: and that player is boss?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 <b>**eulerscheZahl was the boss at BOTG</b></p><p><img src="/a/46567648927625" /> DomiKo: nice
 eulerscheZahl: unless gold players start to optimize against your bot to promote
 eulerscheZahl: and then they kick you hard in legend
 wlesavo: there should be an achievement become a boss
 eulerscheZahl: too random
 jrke: thats why BOTG boss ignores groot :grin:
 wlesavo: but there would be a battle, people would tune their bots aiming somewhere to the league edge
 jrke: i think 300 will be opening of gold

 eulerscheZahl: "We’ll put release in IDE for Rust, C#, F# and VB.net this morning (Wednesday) and see if doesn’t create too many issues for people used to Debug"
 tomatoes: :nerd:
 wlesavo: mid contest is the best time for language updates as always
 Uljahn: that's more like a platform update
 wlesavo: well still holds up
 Uljahn: that's because there's a lot more feedback during contests
 mlemm: anybody using dfs/bfs here&#160;?
 andrefpoliveira: bfs
 mlemm: whats your rank andre
 eulerscheZahl: with some variation of BFS you can surely enter top10
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have a variation of bfs and I'm not there :upside_down:
 andrefpoliveira: 1450th xD
 mlemm: the thing is i was planning to use C to implement it but kinda dead end :D

 eulerscheZahl: who?
 BenjaminUrquhart: give me a sec
 andrefpoliveira: Im trying to improve my depth
 Quidome: anyone&#160;:)
 jrke: mine depth is 5
 andrefpoliveira: Im only getting between 3 and 6
 Bubbly_Bee: Hi all. Is there possibility to buy a coding game T-shirt? Probably I will never get to top 20, but i would like to have one :D
 eulerscheZahl: about 15
 Quidome: what!
 Quidome: nice ...
 andrefpoliveira: damn
 eulerscheZahl: you can only win them, limited edition
 BenjaminUrquhart: seems to be at most 8
 Quidome: And that in C#
 Quidome: very good
 BenjaminUrquhart: but it stops at first brewable 
 JBence: hey euler
 wlesavo: somehow my depth 7 twice better than my depth 15 ladderwise
 JBence: got you back
 eulerscheZahl: i could go deeper if i prune more. depth means nothing
 JBence: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/504160287">https://www.codingame.com/replay/504160287</a>
 Quidome: Aha with pruning, ok
 eulerscheZahl: you won by 2 points JBence&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: any obviously bad move i'm doing?
 Quidome: OK , for another measure then, how many states do you evaluate in a turn?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's an old version of my bot
 andrefpoliveira: 150? xD thats sad
 eulerscheZahl: the one which tells you when you can finish the next potion in the speech bubble
 JBence: yeah, this is from yesterday
 eulerscheZahl: 50k-60k states including duplicates
 andrefpoliveira: F
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl what was the second message for? 
 Quidome: hm , I need to keep working :P
 JBence: you can gain a lot of depth by dropping duplicates
 DomiKo: Euler in first turn?
 eulerscheZahl: your max score after X turns
 DomiKo: in 50ms?
 wlesavo: oh i see
 eulerscheZahl: my time limit is 40ms
 eulerscheZahl: i know i could go higher for the first
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't reuse my tree and i don't need 1s to figure out i should LEARN
 andrefpoliveira: I need to use repeatable spells
 andrefpoliveira: Currently only using 1 time
 wlesavo: same, with 40ms almost no timeouts actually
 JBence: i'm getting timeouts with anything over 30ms
 eulerscheZahl: i few still happen. even in turn 1 where i need 40ms out of 1s. but CG won't tackle that during the contest
 DomiKo: I ask about first turn, because the number of simulation could differ a lot then I guess.
 JBence: working on some tricky bit shifting right now
 DomiKo: Using 1s is uselless I guess
 DomiKo: I could reach like 200K in first one.
 DomiKo: But my eval is so bad&#160;:(
 JBence: you don't need that at the start
 mlemm: guys any materials to read before recoding bfs with c++/c#&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: just hit compile until there are no more errors
 JBence: DomiKo, just try to learn good spells
 rohit523: mlemm c language will also work in c++ right??
 JBence: even without sim
 DomiKo: In terms of top10 "good spell" is not that easy to pick.
 JBence: I'm just saying that you don't need the sim for the spells at the start
 BenjaminUrquhart: I am successfully losing all my battles
 BenjaminUrquhart: yay
 JBence: just do the opposite of what your bot suggest
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm not usually this bad, not sure what's going on
 Scarfield: take a short break, can work wonders when stuck
 BenjaminUrquhart: I did take a break, I haven't really touched this since bronze
 k7n: is there a table where you can see which id a tome gets when turned into a spell?
 Uljahn: there is the referee code
 k7n: thanks, i took me a while to find how the new id gets attributed
 RockyMullet: so is the chat dead or alive today&#160;?
 RockyMullet: oh alive, good good
 RockyMullet: hi
 wlesavo: hi, is this mullet alive?  :slight_smile:
 ciaoo: when will gold league open?
 eulerscheZahl: 6h
 andrefpoliveira: tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: in my timezone it's today
 andrefpoliveira: they changed to 19th
 eulerscheZahl: this display is sometimes buggy
 andrefpoliveira: oh okok
 eulerscheZahl: it's always monday, wednesday, friday
 eulerscheZahl: (except if the contest lasts for a full month)
 Ramdeath: static or dynamic arrays is faster for bfs?
 Ramdeath: in c++
 andrefpoliveira: Can someone teach me how to play offline?
 tobk: there's no straight-forward way to see the number of potions the opponent has brewed, righ?
 andrefpoliveira: You can keep track of how many times the score went up
 Locter: Step 1: turn off the internet
 eulerscheZahl: right, you have to count how often the score increases
 andrefpoliveira: @Locter nice
 andrefpoliveira: Now for real xD
 eulerscheZahl: i can teach you if you use an IDE (intelliJ or eclipse). never tried from the command line
 tobk: Turning off the entire internet is overkill. You just have to unplug your own computer.
 Locter: =))
 andrefpoliveira: I have intellij yeah
 andrefpoliveira: Put I use python
 andrefpoliveira: Is it realy needed?
 andrefpoliveira: really
 RockyMullet: I just saw a FB ad looking for a 3 "ninja master" senior programmer then it followed with "Do you call yourself Sir C++ of Coding&#160;?"
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: excellent ad
 ZarthaxX: carneeeeeeeeeee
 RockyMullet: holla carrnneeeeeee
 ZarthaxX: hai toad
 RockyMullet: are you a ninja master&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: howdy carne
 ZarthaxX: obv, im the najaest
 ZarthaxX: ninjaest*
 RockyMullet: you are Sir Ninja Master
 ZarthaxX: you gotta show that ad btw :rofl:
 RockyMullet: it's in french
 RockyMullet: sadly
 RockyMullet: I translated the good parts :P
 ZarthaxX: cant translate it coz its an image?
 ZarthaxX: sad&#160;:(
 RockyMullet: filled with emojis and "remeber that thing when we were kids" so "old senior programmers" would apply
 eulerscheZahl: hi ZarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: haha okey :P
 ZarthaxX: howdy toad
 RockyMullet: it's a web / mobile app company who keeps poping in my ads, with cringe reference to ninjas all the time
 eulerscheZahl: did i break my bot again or did the timeouts kill my submit?
 RockyMullet: there webpage even is at .ninja
 ZarthaxX: hhahahah so good
 ZarthaxX: are there timeouts issues now??
 ZarthaxX: you are sinking in the bottom toad&#160;:(
 ZarthaxX: ah there you go lol
 eulerscheZahl: "Really hard to investigate. Won’t fix before the end of the challenge. We’ll try to make improvements for next contest.I can only advise to take a bit more margin against the 50ms limit and to limit the nb of objects created for GC. It impacts all players."
 RockyMullet: the toad can swim
 ZarthaxX: okey... sad
 ZarthaxX: true
 eulerscheZahl: will this be one of the contests where i go to legend and call it a day?
 JBence: nah, go for the win
 andrefpoliveira: always ftw
 ZarthaxX: eulerscheZahl prob
 ZarthaxX: i dont see much motivation in this contest
 eulerscheZahl: and resubmit again. 4 timeouts in 20 games at too much to climb
 ZarthaxX: does it really feel like a solo optim game?
 ZarthaxX: that's rough

 CommanderCero: euler leave my tables alone
 eulerscheZahl:  ┻━┻︵ \(°□°)/ ︵ ┻━┻
 andrefpoliveira: Nice
 CommanderCero: :rage:
 RockyMullet: yhyoxx no, the best way is to test locally on your computer
 RockyMullet: but thats not plug n play
 FrancoisB: I don't get the line number in my C# expection stacktrace. I was under the impression it was there before. Is there a trick?
 FrancoisB: exception*
 Uljahn: i guess C# is now in release mode in ide :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that was announced to happen
 FrancoisB:  Maybe they though it could help with the timeouts?
 FrancoisB: ok, cool
 eulerscheZahl: "let's see how many people complain"
 CommanderCero: ive just set my timeout to 40ms
 CommanderCero: and hope it works
 FrancoisB: just making sure I wasn't imagining things haha
 FrancoisB: Well it was convenient to get the line number but it's nothing that a few debug statement can fix. I appreciate they are trying to improve performance.
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Do you prefer promotion with or without recalc. last time, the server was still on heavy load even without it, so I didn't change that much :shrug:
 Whiskee: what's the cutoff, usually?
 dbdr: [CG]SaiksyApo without recalc, no point to it, better to save resources
 [CG]SaiksyApo: It depends of the game and the amount of code required
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Since I played that one, I know for sure that the cut will be way higher than my current score 280+
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Like 150 or so
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Silver was just using some spells in the tome + a proper use of rest time.
 Csipcsirip: euler are u hardstuck rank30 now&#160;?
 wlesavo: any prediction for the initial legend size?
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Legend is aim to be less than 100
 [CG]SaiksyApo: (at the end)
 [CG]SaiksyApo: So usually top 10/20
 wlesavo: euler already started hiding his bot behind timeous 
 wlesavo: i see, thx
 FrancoisB: :joy:
 JohnCM: wow why is bronze so hard for this one?
 JohnCM: i'm trying very hard not to code bfs, but looks like i have to even to get into silver
 [CG]SaiksyApo: Bronze boss has no BFS, it's a simple loop
 Maciulis: well you dont, but if you do, you will be semi prepared for silver 
 wlesavo: you will need *some* kind of search anyway, so better start now
 CommanderCero: how do you know that
 CommanderCero: oh nvm
 CommanderCero: ignore me
 JohnCM: oh is it? my code is just 50 lines for wood haha.. also a simple loop
 JohnCM: i'm trying to do as little as possible to get into silver
 MadKnight: why so&#160;?
 MadKnight: do as fancy as possible while u are still in bronze and get 100% winrate agaainst everyone in bronze
 PED: Hey Maddy
 JohnCM: haha i want to leave some room for improvement
 PED: Wadup&#160;?
 JohnCM: if i code something too good, what if i can't improve further
 mlemm: there is always room for improvements
 RockyMullet: JohnCM and can your code be too good but not good enough at the same time&#160;?
 RockyMullet: there's not much room for heuristic in this one imo
 RockyMullet: better go tryhard now
 JohnCM: heuristic ftw!
 JohnCM: have you heard of heuristic bfs
 RockyMullet: my favorite
 JohnCM: ya that will be my silver
 RockyMullet: there's either something wrong with my sim or my scoring, I NEVER have a sim result that the last actions isnt a brew
 CommanderCero: do you maybe check gameOver wrong
 CommanderCero: in regards to potion count
 eulerscheZahl: makes sense to end the game with brew
 RockyMullet: lol you guys are assuming my sim reaches end of game haha
 RockyMullet: but maybe that's it
 tobk: if you have to pay tax for a spell that already has tax on it itself, you still have to pay the tax before getting the tax back, right?
 PED: Hey eulerscheZahl
 andrefpoliveira: yes
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 RockyMullet: I do have a check to see if all potions are brewed, maybe I wrongly ended up in that case and never check behond that
 eulerscheZahl: haven't seen you in a while
 PED: Havn't been around in a while ^^
 JohnCM: hi
 eulerscheZahl: and a new profile pic
 PED: So corporate ikr
 eulerscheZahl: but not the old Pango one
 PED: Good times
 PED: Anyway, I'm slowly discovering MCTS, had never heard of it before
 PED: Would oyu have ideas on about to deal with the depth of the search&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: cool algo if you have no idea what's going on
 PED: Ahah exactly
 aCat: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a012b5e3-def4-4aab-ad8e-89b607dfcea6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a012b5e3-def4-4aab-ad8e-89b607dfcea6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: beam search for this game i guess
 aCat: why this can happen - it catches my output&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: so little opponent interaction
 eulerscheZahl: maybe a really close timeout?
 aCat: according to Stopwatch I did my search in 3ms
 eulerscheZahl: this contest i a nightmare regarding timeouts
 PED: +1
 eulerscheZahl: and a "won't fix", at least for the duration of the contest
 PED: Ok thanks for the tips euler&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: ok, clearly it, once I brew a potion, I never pass in my sim with this potion brewed, something is wrong
 hasleron: how do you put out the time it took for the move?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on your language
 hasleron: c++
 mlemm: for C i ise clock()
 mlemm: and difference
 RockyMullet: meaning I only choose sims with a brew last, meaning I favorise late brews, meaning my bot has ADD and always switch brew
 hasleron: oh I see
 PED: I've had issues with clock in this contest,, I switched to C++ and high_resolution_clock, since then I have fewer timeouts
 JohnCM: oh no... 35/2406 for bronze with pure heuristic
 JohnCM: i'm still short:(
 JohnCM: haha time to pull out the big guns
 JohnCM: if ppl put sacrifice on a spell, can i learn that spell and gain their sacrifice?
 hasleron: if you can afford your own sacrifices first
 struct: Hello
 JohnCM: as in the sacrifice is for a spell at the bottom of a tomb
 hasleron: yeah
 JohnCM: cool, i see some of my opponents building pyramid
 JohnCM: they put 4 tier 0 sacrifice at the bottom level
 JohnCM: might as well just learn that spell
 hasleron: I see many just learning many spells in the beginning, seems quite successful 
 RockyMullet: JohnCM you can substitute a spell cast that only gives you tier0 ingredient for a learn spell giving taxes
 RockyMullet: you get tier0s AND learn a spell, everybody wins
 struct: Anyone getting random performance spikes in the same game?
 struct: Like 1 turn has 25% less performance than the rest&gt;?
 eulerscheZahl: everyone
 JohnCM: thanks RockyMullet
 JohnCM: rank 35/2406... not enough
 struct: So similar to what I said euler?
 JohnCM: i'm determined to heuristic my way through bronze
 PED: Can you send a replay JohnCM&#160;?
 SelectNull: he-he-he. My bot doesn't use bfs, just only a couple of primitive if-else heuristic rules and it is in the middle of silver leauge...
 mlemm: im stuck in the middle too with same if else
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505077713">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505077713</a>
 JohnCM: this is like 100 lines of if else code
 Chiefbas: 🍋🍋🍋
 JohnCM: heuristic can win this game
 SelectNull: our if-else bots can mine bitcoins when others calculate paths )
 mlemm: yeah when i saw the execution time i was like, it's dumb yes but its hella fast
 PED: Hmm maybe you could consider buying more spells
 struct: Yeah, this really seems to be related to CG, I tried localy, and the turn that I got around 60% less sims, had no performance difference localy
 struct: in c++
 PED: Overall it looks good tho JohnCM&#160;:)
 PED: In this replay towards the end nearly all the potions brewable require some green and you don't have many ways to produce it, so you rely on the basic spell that turns one blue into a green several times, that's not super efficient
 ZarthaxX: PEEEEEEEED
 PED: ZaaaaarthaxX
 ZarthaxX: howdy
 eulerscheZahl: TOOOOOAD
 eulerscheZahl: sorry
 ZarthaxX: i can see your real face now
 ZarthaxX: calling yourself toad :rofl:
 PED: Pretty fancy what the tecvchnology can do nawadays
 ZarthaxX: what haha
 ZarthaxX: photoshoped
 Astrobytes: Good afternoon all
 ZarthaxX: heyo astro

 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 CommanderCero: everyones just throwing my tables around
 eulerscheZahl: little Bobby tables...
 Illedan: I can drop them instead..
 JohnCM: thanks PED
 JohnCM: i'll think of how to buy spells
 JohnCM: now i'm 6/2402just need a little more push
 eulerscheZahl: wait a bit
 struct: ^
 struct: you are only .76 points away frmo boss
 eulerscheZahl: how do you see that so fast?
 struct: Im in bronze
 eulerscheZahl: clever
 JohnCM: haha... if this one cannot i'll code a bfs tomorrow
 eulerscheZahl: good idea
 JohnCM: just lazy to code extra haha
 wlesavo: wait till you see silver boss
 JohnCM: silver no boss yet right
 DomiKo: yes
 eulerscheZahl: in 4.5h
 struct: Im going to try and implement BFS to day
 wlesavo: today there gonna be one
 struct: I think my sim is fast enough
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more worried about the golden one
 wlesavo: same
 JohnCM: see who's code gets selected for silver then
 JohnCM: whose*
 wlesavo: legend is gonna be so hard
 JBence: approx how many players will go through gold?
 wlesavo: saisky said ~150
 wlesavo: damn tilda
 DomiKo: can we all crash our bots that boss will be bad?
 eulerscheZahl: what's wrong with the tilde?
 DomiKo: and make easy legend for everyone :D&#160;?
 JBence: i read it as a tilde
 struct: tilde always showed like that for me in chat ~   -
 eulerscheZahl: we already do crash our bots
 eulerscheZahl: i blame CG
 eulerscheZahl: right, you and your weird font sets
 JohnCM: yes easy legend ty
 JohnCM: pls bump me up bronze... i'm 2 spots away from boss
 JohnCM: XD
 JohnCM: thank you everyone.. i'm in silver now:)
 PED: GZ&#160;!
 JohnCM: thanks PED
 JohnCM: i realize my bot crashes when it reaches tier 4 ingredients and cannot do anything else
 JohnCM: what do you all do to resolve it?
 goolmoos: use the tier 4 ingredients
 JohnCM: but what if i can't
 goolmoos: plan ahead
 SirLoxley: or convert to tier 0 and dump on tomes
 JohnCM: i see... you need the convert tier 0 spell though
 JohnCM: anyway i only plan 3 steps ahead so far
 JohnCM: maybe it will be resolved after i do bfs
 goolmoos: try to plan ahead more than one move at a time
 SirLoxley: consider tomes as some sort of a extra heap for tier0 ingreds
 goolmoos: yeah, 3 is still not mush
 JohnCM: my 3 steps ahead is actually not really planning
 JohnCM: it is more like a for loop for requirements
 JohnCM: it is still essentially a one-step planning
 JohnCM: oh.. and 1283/1623
 JohnCM: in silver
 JohnCM: i think with bfs can go gold alr
 JohnCM: also, quick question
 JohnCM: do you all use the repeated casting ability?
 RockyMullet: its important yes
 JohnCM: i don't see ppl using it though
 JohnCM: maybe not in bronze
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/505102312">https://www.codingame.com/replay/505102312</a>
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: i don't no what to improve next?
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: hint pls?
 RockyMullet: JohnCM in the viewer it looks like a single spell
 SelectNull: JohnCM without bfs you can be in the middle of the list as I do )))
 JohnCM: haha i am already in the middle of the list lol
 SelectNull: cool)
 JohnCM: warrior of code, yours look like you are not prioritizing the right spell
 JohnCM: your potion making speed same as the boss, but the score is much lower
 JohnCM: go for spells that give high cost low turn ratio
 JohnCM: for me i used a heuristic to judge how many turns it needs
 JohnCM: with bfs you can get exact
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: hmm basically I have to improve my method to calculate profit
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: right?
 CommanderCero: Question: You can only get 8times an urgency bonus during a game right? +3 4 times and +1 4 times.Its not like once +3 is used up that +1 will always be awarded, right?
 struct: yeah
 PED: WaRiOrOfCoDe in your replay you almost only use basic spells
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: Hmm I don't know why&#160;?
 PED: These are not very efficient, maybe you shoudl get more spells or find a way to use your non-basic spells more often
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: Yeah I am working on that...
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: thanks
 JohnCM: yes... non-basic spells save turns
 PED: npnp&#160;:)
 WaRiOrOfCoDe: @JohnCM thanks for input as well

 eulerscheZahl: speed
 struct: Im getting around 400k
 struct: 400-500k
 struct: By doing getAllActions, play random do simple eval

 struct: If I remove pragmas I get one less 0
 struct: But speed is not everything
 yhyoxx: i just implemented minimax to find best decision in every step, more that 4 in depth results in timeout, am i wasting my time or should i explore ways to optimize&#160;?
 struct: Despite me having this number I doubt I can do a good AI
 tpeti: can it happen in CoC that the evaluator mistakes? I mean two practically same solutions got 80% and 100%
 CommanderCero: i also can get around 200k but my ai is lacking in terms of heuristic and opponent prediction
 Nerchio: when saying these numbers do you guys mean states processed or created
 LordSkaven: I usually explore around 4000 nodes,
 CommanderCero: rounds simulated, so states processed
 yhyoxx: per turn µ?
 struct: Create state -&gt; for (i &lt; depth){ getallactions, playrandomAction}eval
 Presac: How do you save your states/nodes? Cause mine seems to take to long to process.
 struct: How big is your state Presac?
 Presac: Pretty big.
 struct: how many bytes?
 Presac: oh, didn't think of bytes. Using classes in python. 
 yhyoxx: my states are a class with a bunch of vectors and methods 
 Presac: Haven't tried my hand a lot at these bots. Didn't think about using bytes to represent it instead.
 struct: my state is 168 bytes
 yhyoxx: i guess classes are slow, one should try to store everything in smaller data structure
 Presac: Damn that is a lot of restructuring of my code...
 yhyoxx: mine is 136 apparently
 SauceChord: Is this chat about the spring challenge or something more global?

 Uljahn: legend or delete?
 AshKetchum: Uljahn was the question for me?
 eulerscheZahl: is it harsh to use ?disableChat when random users keep DMing you with questions?
 struct: If that was the case I could delete now
 Astrobytes: Depends how many/how frequently eulerscheZahl
 struct: Depends on the user too
 Astrobytes: You really have been getting them this time around huh
 Astrobytes: Yeah for sure struct
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i'm a DM magnet this contest
 Uljahn: AshKetchum: have you set the same seed?
 struct: This is why i am not at the top
 AshKetchum: yes

 AshKetchum: 54321 was my seed
 LordSkaven: I want to ask euler some questions, but I decided to wait until after the contest

 yhyoxx: who wouldnt dm you 
 Astrobytes: Being the Almighty Toad is a double-edged sword eh&#160;;)
 struct: that is the way to do it lord
 yhyoxx:  who wouldnt want to dm you* 
 eulerscheZahl: I
 struct: I dont thnk I ever dm anyone during contests asking questions
 struct: I just use global chat
 ZarthaxX: ofc you dont
 ZarthaxX: :D
 struct: ZarthaxX  you are different
 ZarthaxX: im your partner
 struct: except ZarthaxX and MadKnight
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:*
 WINWINWIN: Euler, dont you have to follow the person for them to be able to DM you?
 ZarthaxX: how is that sim going structo

 ZarthaxX: AstroTaxx
 ZarthaxX: AstroTaxX
 Astrobytes: :P
 eulerscheZahl: no WINWINWIN. when i'm here on chat they can just click my name
 ZarthaxX: okey, the tax part doesnt sound nice
 ZarthaxX: AstroThaxX
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 WINWINWIN: Oh, yeah forgot about that
 Hurda: Does my Java code run in the JVM with anything else?
 Astrobytes: Meh, don't worry Zartho, just messing around, call me what you like :P
 Hurda: Is there any more info on the JVM environment?
 ZarthaxX: Astrobyto then
 WINWINWIN: Hurda, I think that there are some details on languages in the forum
 WINWINWIN: I`ll try to pull up the link
 Hurda: TY that wold be helpfull, I'm trying optimize something nad I could not get proper sleep thinking about it...&#160;:-D
 WINWINWIN: :D we all know the feeling
 Astrobytes: hey WINWINWIN&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Hey Astrobytes&#160;:)
 SirLoxley: Who else is adding random insults at the end of the output?
 SirLoxley: I put them to spice up the battle.
 MadKnight: just don't make them too straight
 Presac: Anyone who has some tips on working with bytes to represent states in python?
 MadKnight: yea i got one
 MadKnight: don't use python if u want speed
 Uljahn: Presac: structured arrays or ndarrays in numpy?
 Presac: numpy would be preffered
 WINWINWIN: Anyone know where the forum post on the details of each languages is?
 WINWINWIN: With how they are loaded and used?
 eulerscheZahl: do you mean the FAQ? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 WINWINWIN: Ah, thanks Euler
 Presac: Just getting questions back from asking questions is already giving me more to work with. There are so many things I didn't even think to use, even though I know about them. Had forgotten about numpy too.
 AllYourMCTS: anyone have function that takes number of each ingredient and outputs index into the 1001 possible ingredient hands?
 Uljahn: ye
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: maybe
 Uljahn: inventory_ix = np.where(np.all(possible_inventories == inventory, axis=-1))  # ezpz
 AllYourMCTS: lol
 AllYourMCTS: yeah a hashmap may be fastest
 AntiSquid: do you have a pet turtle&#160;?
 JohnCM: you could just store the inventory as a 4-digit number
 AntiSquid: oh john is back, hi
 JohnCM: abcd, a = tier 0, b = tier 1, c = tier2, d = tier3
 JohnCM: hello
 wlesavo: JohnCM 10 is not a digit though
 ZarthaxX: hexa hehe
 JohnCM: you won't have 10 of the same ingredient will you?
 AllYourMCTS: yeah but i want to use it as an index into an 1001 length array
 JohnCM: haha

 ZarthaxX: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'll cry in the corner
 Illedan: I
 ZarthaxX: sad
 Illedan: I'll join you.
 eulerscheZahl: 21 losses. 10 by timeout
 JohnCM: don't lookahead so much then
 eulerscheZahl: some even in the first turn. i use 40ms and CG allows 1s
 Illedan: -.-
 Q12: when gold league is open?
 eulerscheZahl: in 2.5h
 eulerscheZahl: around 150 will promote
 Q12: :disappointed:
 tempux: Sadge
 AntiSquid: that timeout bug was there during the Winter Throne "contest", timeouts at around 30ms
 LordSkaven: 150? Damn that is rough
 eulerscheZahl: wait for legend
 eulerscheZahl: that's like 10-15
 AntiSquid: that is euler's prediction, nothing official LordSkaven
 CommanderCero: 100% confirmed
 AntiSquid: where
 eulerscheZahl: but my predictions will match the official numbers
 AntiSquid: top 20 probably for legend
 eulerscheZahl: i also predicted 7k contest participants
 CommanderCero: i mean hes hypnotoad
 LordSkaven: yeah because your predictions are working so well for your bot euler hehe
 struct: I believe euler
 struct: yeah
 struct: I predicted 6k and his prediction seems more accurate
 AntiSquid: don't think it goes up to 7k ... 6.5k ok but 7? nah
 struct: There are currently 6246
 eulerscheZahl: and still a weekend
 struct: Also a lot of people mostly from japan, keep sharing it on twitter
 eulerscheZahl: and i made the prediction in friday or saturday
 AntiSquid: 200-300 for gold imo
 struct: too much imo
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl: i go with 7k<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-11-14">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Chat:World/2020-11-14</a>
 yhyoxx: what would be a good eval function&#160;?
 wlesavo: AntiSquid saisky was on chat today, he backed up eulers predictions
 wlesavo: i.e 150 / 10-15
 AntiSquid: oh
 eulerscheZahl: did he also confirm the 7k?
 AntiSquid: well that's different then :P
 xSkyline: If I don't get promoted today to gold can I get in tomorrow if my bot improves&#160;?
 AntiSquid: that's not a prediction lol that's a statement
 struct: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i'll single-handedly create 500 alt accounts if it's necessary
 AntiSquid: official one too
 struct: xSkyline yes
 JohnCM: then euler can dominate gold league with his alts. no one can rise to legend
 xSkyline: thanks @struct
 AntiSquid: you have time until contest ends, you can even do a last minute submit with the #1 bot and reach legend .... 
 struct: 1 submiit legend
 struct: do it
 AntiSquid: if you have 1k TPUs at home that is .
 AntiSquid: :D
 AntiSquid: some kind of ML got to be possible for this game, right&#160;?
 MarekM: is there any RAM limit? it feels like i am timeouted for no reason (python)
 struct: 768MB
 eulerscheZahl: 768MB
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 AntiSquid: 768MB
 CommanderCero: 768MB
 wlesavo: euler have timeouts irl already
 MarekM: it should be enough for everyone&#160;:)
 LordSkaven: 768000 KB
 MarekM: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: submit finished nowgames parsed: 99     timeouts found: 14
 xSkyline: ┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠ ノ)
 struct: ouch
 struct: That is way too much
 CommanderCero: whats your time limit
 eulerscheZahl: i think i should be higher than #14
 eulerscheZahl: 40ms
 struct: for sure
 eulerscheZahl: and timeout in turn 1
 CommanderCero: okay nvm
 struct: with 14 loses due to timeout
 Csipcsirip: i hade to set my time limit to 35
 AntiSquid: euler who do you predict to rank higher at the end, you or your twin&#160;?
 wlesavo: i had none last submit, also with 40 ms
 Gronahak: I'm curious how do you count thos timeouts&#160;? :thinking:
 AntiSquid: end of contest i mean .
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i forgot 3 games (wasn't completely finished)
 eulerscheZahl: games parsed: 102     timeouts found: 16
 CommanderCero: yes found 2 more
 struct: so close to 15%
 struct: Way too high
 eulerscheZahl: 30 losses, 16 my timeout
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise i'm happy with that submit
 struct: Gronahak using api and then extract replay data
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8bdfd3b5-17a5-4029-bd5a-5c1e21b5194b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8bdfd3b5-17a5-4029-bd5a-5c1e21b5194b</a>
 AntiSquid: you can look at last battles and count manually Gronahak ... or use api
 struct: at least 2 on turn 1
 struct: they are all on turn 1?
 struct: what
 eulerscheZahl: most, not all
 xSkyline: eulerscheZahl does your timeout check account for garbacge collerctor stalls&#160;? Maybe you have some GC stalls between the time you check the timer and start it again
 eulerscheZahl: time starts after reading inputs (first line actually)
 wlesavo: time to rewrite
 eulerscheZahl: i'll pick dbdr to compare. he just submitted too
 struct: im rewriting too
 struct: I want to try something
 Gronahak: Oh nice ty didn't know about the API
 struct: I think its my 8th rewrite
 AntiSquid: no need to rewrite if i didn't write much in the first place *smart thinking*
 eulerscheZahl: no timeout found? that doesn't sound right
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: do you have any timeouts?
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think he wants to build a bot to get there
 struct: if(language!=rust &amp;&amp; rand()&#160;% 100 == 15) timeout
 dbdr: not in my sub
 Uljahn: so RIIR is new meta? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: why not?
 Illedan: RIIR?
 dbdr: 25 ms 
 eulerscheZahl: i have 16&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Gronahak: @struct :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: but i have so many in the first turn already
 dbdr: #16 with 16 timeouts? wow

 dbdr: timeout in 1s?
 eulerscheZahl: i use 40ms
 struct: Its very strange
 eulerscheZahl: but most of my timeouts are frame 1
 Kaa: Is there any way to get the example of input?
 dbdr: which is 1s
 Illedan: Did you check if you actually crash eulerscheZahl? :P 
 eulerscheZahl: random input:

 dbdr: Kaa print it yourself
 Kaa: thank you
 eulerscheZahl: how do i check that Illedan?
 AntiSquid: what if you run your code offline multiple times&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: do you ever crash 1st turn?
 eulerscheZahl: send to IDE works fine
 Illedan: hm, ok
 struct: euler print to stderr before starting the search
 Kaa: should I believe that 500,000 operations per turn be &lt;50ms (on Rust)?
 Kaa: *500,000,000
 eulerscheZahl: actually I do: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vljrf6">https://prnt.sc/vljrf6</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i see the turn input
 eulerscheZahl: but no turn result in stderr either
 eulerscheZahl: i start my timer after reading all the inputs. but shouldn't make much of a difference?
 struct: no way it can make a 10ms difference
 struct: if it does its CG fault
 struct: What do you mean Kaa?
 eulerscheZahl: we are talking about turn 1. 960ms difference
 AntiSquid: CG timer lost precision due to the many participants?
 struct: true
 eulerscheZahl: i really consider porting to C++
 struct: Do it
 Kaa: We have TL for 50ms per turn..I'm trying to figure out how many operations my algo can do
 Presac: eulerscheZahl what does the last 4 numbers in each line represent in the image?
 struct: castable repeatable?
 eulerscheZahl: that's just the input stream to stderr
 AntiSquid: tax 
 eulerscheZahl: i'll check timeouts for another C# player
 Illedan: Check mine.
 eulerscheZahl: emkjp with 3

 Illedan: yeah :P
 struct: euler now check for c++ player&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: check emil
 PED: Hey! do we know around which time gold will open?
 struct: in 2 hours
 dreadylein: you had the timeouts on first turn right&#160;?
 PED: ty
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan: 5 out of 90
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, I do get longer time on the first round from the first input to the last input :O
 Illedan: Only 7 ms, but you should check your code
 Illedan: every other round is 0 ms
 eulerscheZahl: but 900ms?
 Illedan: :shrug:
 Illedan: Worth measuring :P
 eulerscheZahl: emil without any timeouts
 dreadylein: dont know enough about the gc design but in theory, if they feed 1 line and the server stalls for x it could absolutly mess up measuring on the clientside i guess
 dreadylein: but in this case you would have to see it at least sometimes in native languages also
 eulerscheZahl: ClockSort (C#):
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dec3975f-702f-4af0-b89a-19124e6171a1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dec3975f-702f-4af0-b89a-19124e6171a1</a>
 LucasMorin: hello, i would like to train on trees, do you know which game I should be playing&#160;?
 dreadylein: but yeah .. 900ms is a lot of time for a gc 
 eulerscheZahl: i definitely get more timeouts than other C# users
 eulerscheZahl: but C# seems to be more affected than Rust (would need more data for that thesis)
 ClockSort: my c# strategy is to never new anything onto the heap that will lose its reference
 ClockSort: and I'm running 650k iterations  DFS with no problem in C#
 eulerscheZahl: rafbill 3 out of 228
 ClockSort: almost no timeouts
 hbouillo: Is there any way to know automatically how many battles timed outs?
 ClockSort: currently 57th place.
 ClockSort: sorry, BFS, not DFS lol
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i checked you ClockSort. you are among the highest with C#
 eulerscheZahl: I still tend to convert to C++
 ClockSort: yes, I decided to stick with C# to improve my C# skills, which are more useful in other areas of my world
 eulerscheZahl: you have to finish this fight without me then. I believe in the power of C#. just not on this CG platform
 reCurse: Your mileage may vary
 reCurse: Oh of your world
 ClockSort: I last used C++ about 20 years, so i'm a bit rusty there, no pun intended, haha
 reCurse: Carry on
 ClockSort: recurse you've been really helpful, thanks btw
 reCurse: :blush:
 hbouillo: Wasn't the gold league supposed to open 4 minutes ago? :grin: Sorry I'm just getting excited hehe
 reCurse: 2 hours
 reCurse: Approximately
 reCurse: Could be 3! or more
 hbouillo: Okay, thanks!
 ClockSort: probably not 3! because that's actually 6
 hbouillo: So there's no fixed time for leagues to open?
 RaghuveerJayanth: #UZMeNow
 reCurse: I was afraid of that joke the moment I pressed enter
 ClockSort: unexpected factorial :D
 RockyMullet: good old time in contest where I fix my stuff and it's worse because I was avoiding bugs
 reCurse: It's done manually
 reCurse: But usually around whatever is your time in 2 hours
 hbouillo: Oooh I see!
 hbouillo: Alright, thanks!
 ClockSort: @rockymullet I know how you feel! 
 ClockSort: i had a bug where REST would only rest one of my items in the search. I fix it and now I rest too much. haha
 Csipcsirip: rest in peace
 RockyMullet: ClockSort yeah exactly, had a bug where I would stop at first brew in my sim, I fixed it, now I full my inveotyr too much cause I dont have any difference in my scoring for having too many ingredients, as long as I have enough
 ClockSort: exactly&#160;:)
 ClockSort: recurse what do you think of LEARN commands? worthwhile to put them in the search, especially at first, or better to build a separate heuristic for your spellset?
 reCurse: :zipper_mouth:
 RockyMullet: learning allows you to cast it deeper in your sim
 Q12: I check my sim with Learn and it didn't help

 Samer: hey guys
 Samer: i'm gonna try asking again, maybe someone can help now
 Samer: who succeeded in running the game locally for testing? i'm getting a "main manifest missing" error when trying to run the game
 arkwaw: in c++ nowadays you have things like "std::visit" straight from object programing patterns
 Zenoscave: mornin
 Zenoscave: do I have time for a final submit before gold?
 Zenoscave: I should probably wait...
 SippinSelecto: hello guys, python question: someone know how to use variable into an array index with a colon (ex: array[var:10]) thanks&#160;:) 
 Zenoscave: like a slice&#160;?
 Zenoscave: That should work as you type it
 SippinSelecto: :grimacing: well i'm embarassed that i haven't think of slice ahah
 SippinSelecto: thank you
 Zenoscave: your code you typed in the first message is fine. it works
 SippinSelecto: well i tried it and nothing was returned
 Zenoscave: then var is larger than the size of the array

 Gronahak: @SippinSelecto check thos exemples out ^
 SippinSelecto: thanks i checked your examples
 SippinSelecto: but in codingame IDE it seems not working, im trying again
 Gronahak: when you use a slice the first index is included, but the last one is excluded
 Zenoscave: ^ this is important
 ClockSort: i just built my own simulator
 Zenoscave: nice clock sort
 Zenoscave: Not using the ref?
 ClockSort: nope. so i can tweak my bot and play it against my old bot 300x to see if it was an improvement
 Gronahak: :clap:
 Zenoscave: Brutal tester
 Zenoscave: How long to run 300?
 ClockSort: long time ya
 ClockSort: because they both try to use 50ms per move&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: errar on LB 
 Zenoscave: Fair. There's a generic solution available. but it needs some edits. I'm forking and fixing now
 ClockSort: i didn't want to mess with jvm
 Samer: Zenoscave are you referring to what i asked about earlier?
 ClockSort: how do you hook up the inputs/outputs to your agent?
 Zenoscave: Samer yes
 Zenoscave: stddup
 emh: I'm trying to use _pdep_u64(1ULL &lt;&lt; n, x); but getting compile error that it won't inline
 emh: any ideas?
 emh: I have #pragma to inline
 Zenoscave: inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline))
 Zenoscave: use the attribute
 Zenoscave: it makes inlining more aggressive
 Zenoscave: I assume c++ and not rust
 Poli2312: Hi
 TEstTEst: hello, when the gold league will open?
 ClockSort: hello, maybe two hours
 struct: 30  minutes+-
 emh: Zenoscave doesn't seem to help. same error message
 jrke: 35 mins from now
 jrke: max 40 mins
 Zenoscave: what's the error emh? PM me
 TEstTEst: thanks, and there is a fix number of participant that will be promoted or it just related to score?
 ntroPi: One bot will be selected as new silver boss. Promotion rules are as always.
 ntroPi: (ranked above boss == promotion)
 AntiSquid: one bot to rule them all
 AbsentMoon: How can I figure out how long each turn is taking me?
 AntiSquid: is rust faster than C++&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: on CG
 Ikhadem: how can i detect the exact ms i did a watch on my code but it return times that are way over the limit and i dont time-out
 dbdr: very similar I think
 TimurSeitosmanov: +1 to timing question... those random timeouts are killing me
 jrke: which lang TimurSeitosmanov?
 TimurSeitosmanov: typescript
 jrke: TimurSeitosmanov how much time is your code using in non timeouts game on average?
 TimurSeitosmanov: how can I see this?
 jrke: is your bot heuristic based or any search?
 TimurSeitosmanov: bfs search
 TimurSeitosmanov: but seriously, is there any API accessible from js runner for timing?
 jrke: no idea for timing APIs

 eulerscheZahl: but bots are different, i just tested if you might be the boss
 jrke: league opening message :smiley:
 AntiSquid: crab league
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/823c3135-191e-4f78-ab4e-571d4c9971f2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/823c3135-191e-4f78-ab4e-571d4c9971f2</a>
 eulerscheZahl: how do i do that in C++?
 AntiSquid: saiksy first on LB but ranked 115&#160;?
 JBence: are you turning to the dark side?
 AntiSquid: wonder how their promotion works
 eulerscheZahl: too many timeouts
 jrke: saiksy in gold
 JBence: I'm thinking about it too
 tempux: c++ doesnt have yield :D
 eulerscheZahl: cheater
 kreska: so only top 115 will qulify for gold?
 WINWINWIN: what about storing and returning an array euler?
 AntiSquid: what is yield&#160;?
 AntiSquid: in c#
 WINWINWIN: Returning multiple values
 eulerscheZahl: one time saiksy decided to put a player as boss
 AntiSquid: just return array / vector&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: and at the exact moment the player hit submit
 eulerscheZahl: everyone got promoted
 AntiSquid: last contest
 CommanderCero: did they just put everyone in gold
 eulerscheZahl: fun times
 ClockSort: i only see 131 in gold
 AntiSquid: and demoted
 CommanderCero: oh nvm
 Illedan: Sweet! Smaller league!
 CommanderCero: it showed me 1600
 JBence: went from silver 113 to gold 96
 eulerscheZahl: pending submits
 jrke: 131 
 CommanderCero: yeah my rank also went up
 AntiSquid: more to come
 eulerscheZahl: we lost pb
 Illedan: They didn't move all yet
 AntiSquid: &gt; 200 watch 
 WINWINWIN: Has the guy put as 132 been made the boss?
 tempux: :unamused: stuck in silver for ever i guess
 kreska: im 173 and i was 300 so i guess 127 go to gold?
 jrke: did ranking got changes
 eulerscheZahl: some players left behind who were not pending
 eulerscheZahl: that round dice was beating me hard anyways, deserves him right
 WINWINWIN: Ah, so they autopromote some guys then set a boss?
 jrke: can anyone in silver tell me the name of silver boss
 eulerscheZahl: just promotions that got more boring
 Lysk: bossdorf
 Q12: Bossdorf
 eulerscheZahl: years ago you could see the boss submit
 eulerscheZahl: and climb up the ladder
 jrke: thanks
 Lysk: once upon a time yeah

 eulerscheZahl: everyone cheering where it will end
 eulerscheZahl: i miss that&#160;:(
 jrke: lol people who were having pending submits lefted in silver
 eulerscheZahl: lefted?
 AntiSquid: you mean the 4 hour long recalc on new league open?
 eulerscheZahl: i miss that aspect less
 jrke: means they didn't get promoted to gold euler
 AntiSquid: kinda weird opening this time, i see a lot of top 100 still in silver lol
 miszu: question for the challenge, is optimization important? I like to code in OOP way but to achieve best perfomance you need to put it away and play with bytes, bitoperations etc. Is that necessary?
 wlesavo: saisky asked today if we want recal for gold or not
 eulerscheZahl: yeees!
 struct: Why does vs code intellisense keep breaking
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: at least for legend
 AntiSquid: so that means what? 20 people in chat were asked :P
 eulerscheZahl: struct i need your C++ skills
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/823c3135-191e-4f78-ab4e-571d4c9971f2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/823c3135-191e-4f78-ab4e-571d4c9971f2</a>
 eulerscheZahl: how to do that in C++?
 eulerscheZahl: it's like an iterator
 Lysk: you can't directly
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 Michael_Howard: Damn that silver boss is higher than I expected.
 CommanderCero: you need to remember the state yourself
 Lysk: something about coroutine
 goolmoos: one behind boss!
 Beresta: I don't think you should do that in C# either, performance-wise won't be great :D

 WINWINWIN: Euler
 Csipcsirip: u can have static variable inside functions. its like a global variable but only accessable from the fucntion
 eulerscheZahl: that yield return avoids creating a list
 lowzhao: huge pressure D:
 miszu: oh I am doing it in java
 CommanderCero: oh yeah static variables is a good idea
 AntiSquid: ah missed a lmgtfy WINWINWIN :P
 WINWINWIN: :P
 miszu: but I am afraid ppl with C++ will have it an easy time
 struct: easy time?
 jrke: ^
 struct: is not like if you know c++ you get instant legend
 AntiSquid: why not return pointer to a list euler? 
 miszu: no fore sure but
 CommanderCero: c++ is the most confusing clusterfuck of a language ive ever seen
 LordSkaven: C++ isnt a magic pill
 Starbender: well.. they have to code in c++ so feel for them haha
 AntiSquid: or vector&#160;! @_@
 miszu: c++ you can do stuff that in java you can't
 miszu: that 50ms is very small for java
 struct: euler if you pass a vector that has already reserved memory it is fast
 AntiSquid: i am confused by your confusion CommanderCero
 eulerscheZahl: but that refers to BOOST
 CommanderCero: AntiSquid did you hurt yourself
 AntiSquid: unless we talk about templates and meta programming CommanderCero
 struct: That should return all active spells right?
 LordSkaven: lol the boss just timed out
 eulerscheZahl: vector would work i guess
 Beresta: CommanderCero I wonder if you seen PHP for example :D 
 eulerscheZahl: or that static array. and i just return the number of items
 struct: If you reserve the memory of the vector it is fast
 WINWINWIN: Is MSmits there in the contest?
 CommanderCero: Im also talking about the subtle differences between references and pointers, how they handle iterators etc
 eulerscheZahl: feels ugly but it already is
 Lysk: reserved space is nice when you know the max size
 CommanderCero: nothing ive seen in any other language
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1c0e154c-43b6-4c59-bb8c-d03ee7a9f865">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1c0e154c-43b6-4c59-bb8c-d03ee7a9f865</a>
 struct: Lysk that or if you reuse the same vector
 CommanderCero: std::move() was also confusing me for a while idk why
 struct: multiple times
 jrke: MSmits is 2473 currently
 AntiSquid: overengineering
 eulerscheZahl: so, what's the next scheduled promotion time for silver players?
 eulerscheZahl: i see some finished submits but no new golden players
 struct: should be instant right?
 struct: or close to it
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 struct: Or did they forgot to change it for this contest?
 eulerscheZahl: worked for lower leagues
 eulerscheZahl: who's in silver and can tell?
 ZarthaxX: boss almost finished computing
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Nerchio: the algorithm is bugged i didn't get into gold
 jrke: oh boss is also computing lol
 AntiSquid: what rank were you Nerchio&#160;?
 ZarthaxX: c# boss toad
 ZarthaxX: your friend c# :P
 Starbender: I've just reached bronze and that varying spell cost is gonna be such a pain to handle 😨
 eulerscheZahl: yeah i'm a C++ guy now
 dbf: 40 ms per turn - 3/10 timeouts&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i feel with you dbf
 Nerchio: AntiSquid like 140 idk
 eulerscheZahl: was hoping that it would get better when i convert
 eulerscheZahl: but you use C++, don't you?
 jrke: looks sinofwrath is gold boss
 jrke: c# + bottom gold
 jrke: sorry silver boss not gold boss
 jrke: 8 entered in gold

 miszu: dbf, do you computer moves in advance or not?
 JBence: maybe not deterministic
 miszu: compute*
 struct: I guess I need to switch back to VS 2019, for some reason vs code seems to keep breaking intellisense
 struct: Does it happen for someone else?
 struct: Im using cpp with wsl 2
 eulerscheZahl: boss is deterministic
 Gabbek: hello&#160;:)
 Gabbek: how's going guys?
 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: it's timing out
 struct: the boss?
 ZarthaxX: toad
 eulerscheZahl: me
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 NinjaDoggy: :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: i'm self-centered
 ZarthaxX: he is still "joking" with that
 struct: still in C#?
 ZarthaxX: sad jokes tbh
 Gabbek: so you've changed to C++ eulerscheZahl?
 struct: euler can you check how many timeouts I have?
 struct: I use 40ms and dont even start the timer in the right place
 Gabbek: (I've been sleeping more than doing anything useful, so I might be late to the party with my questions :P)
 eulerscheZahl: i'm on it
 Cappefra: @struct just go ctrl+shift+p and select "Restart Omnisharp"
 aCat: boss timeouted ;p
 eulerscheZahl: Error 404. Player not found. Double check your nickname and the selected puzzle. Please note that cgstats can't find your ranking if you are above the first 1000 players. If you think cgstats should find you and this is an error, try to ask Magus.

 struct: Have you ever had any problems where intellisense stops working for no apparent reason?
 reCurse: That's been intellisense for the past 20 years
 reCurse: Good luck
 struct: ah ok
 struct: thanks euler
 reCurse: For instance right now there's a header file I made that's making intellisense go nuts
 eulerscheZahl: i decided to set up VS code just for this contest (monodevelop sucks more and more)
 reCurse: So I isolated it to a separate cpp so it keeps working for the rest
 eulerscheZahl: i also know the crashing intellisense
 Nerchio: euler what's the most processed nodes you got in C#?
 reCurse: And that's with vs not vs code
 reCurse: But it doesn't matter
 eulerscheZahl: the root nodes
 eulerscheZahl: trick question?
 Nerchio: evaluated nodes i guess
 eulerscheZahl: arouind 60k
 reCurse: It's not about the count it's about how you use them
 Nerchio: were you using bitset?
 ZarthaxX: :rofl.
 ZarthaxX: :rofl: *
 ZarthaxX: that phrase always applies
 eulerscheZahl: no but stored some data in an int that aren't an int
 Nerchio: ok i guess its similar ;p
 reCurse: camouflint
 eulerscheZahl: my inventory isn't an array at least
 reCurse: Why not a class with 4 properties
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i have a screenshot for you
 reCurse: That was a joke btw
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/vjj4he">https://prnt.sc/vjj4he</a>
 reCurse: Class with 4 ints, is there a worse way to represent inventory
 reCurse: OK
 dreadylein: class with 4 strings ^^
 reCurse: I've been defeated
 ZarthaxX: wtf is that
 NinjaDoggy: why is euler leaking our DMS&#160;:(
 dbf: not yours, name is about 3 lettes :D
 Astrobytes: lol, I remember that from the other day. Still wtf :D
 eulerscheZahl: don't DM me if you can't handle leaks
 struct: ZarthaxX dont you dare leaking
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not discrete
 ZarthaxX: time to expose structo
 Astrobytes: Just continous eulerscheZahl?
 struct: :hammer:
 AntiSquid: ya that was a short name :thinking:
 reCurse: Haha I was jokingly thinking of someone
 reCurse: Then I was thinking, hmm too long
 reCurse: Then I check Discord, short name
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i edited it that you think it's short
 struct: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: maybe not&#160;!
 miszu: why a class with 4 ints is  bad?
 struct: Cant be me I use structs
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 AntiSquid: ok then not
 struct: I said before I store the 4 ingredients in 1 int
 v1993: Well, you need 4bits per ingredient, so 16bit unsigned could do...
 eulerscheZahl: how to handle overflows?
 NinjaDoggy: a 10 bit unsigned could also do&#160;:)
 struct: ^
 struct: too much work
 eulerscheZahl: and for convenience you want the total too
 struct: 1 int is simple
 NinjaDoggy: honestly having done both methods...
 v1993: Never said that you can use it like that, just store
 eulerscheZahl: i can fit it in 16 bit. but that makes using it less efficient
 NinjaDoggy: bitmask is tougher than precompute
 NinjaDoggy: I had a 25 bit bitmask to store inventory
 eulerscheZahl: but probably faster
 NinjaDoggy: is it faster than array access?
 AntiSquid: submits slow?
 eulerscheZahl: just add 2 numbers and you have the new inventory
 NinjaDoggy: you also need to check valid after?
 NinjaDoggy: so it's like add 2 numbers, and then a check right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: would have to time what's faster
 CommanderCero: I know that the bitmask increased my speed by quite a bit, but Ive used 4 ints previously. Seems like many people also just used 4chars idk if thats faster
 JBence: euler, why would the 16bit be less efficient?
 struct: I guess because you need to deal  with overflow
 Cappefra: @struct for intellisense just go ctrl+shift+p and select "Restart Omnisharp"
 eulerscheZahl: talking about speed efficiency when you want to do computations with it
 eulerscheZahl: take 2 deltas (your inventory + spell)
 struct: Cappefra Ominsharp doesnt show for me
 eulerscheZahl: and add them. overflows will affect the other types
 struct: Im using c++
 eulerscheZahl: so you need a 0 as a blocker
 Cappefra: oh ok than I have no idea
 struct: np
 struct: ill just use VS
 Cappefra: gawd I'll never optimize like that&#160;:/ my bot is all object-oriented, for inventory, spells and orders I have subclasses of a class called Ingredients
 LordSkaven: I dont know if I need to improve performance or evalutation to better my bot. hmmm
 Cappefra: I guess that's part of the reason why my bfs can only visit so many states
 Cappefra: @LordSkaven I feel ya
 Cappefra: anyways: can I be in more than one language chat?
 Cappefra: I'd like to be in World, It and De too
 dbdr: #De
 Cappefra: that was easy, thanks!
 AntonCosmin: I made the bot in C#, if I have classes does this mean is takes more time to execute?
 CommanderCero: creating a lot of classes will make it quite slow. One optimisation in c# is to use structs and arrays if you want to generate a lot of objects. But structs do not behave like classes in c# so if you dont know the difference it can get quite messy
 Gabbek: AntonCosmin - you should use profiler to find out what's slow. For example: if you're using containers in your game state then that probably takes a lot of time, especially if you're using new as well.
 AbuuDarda: there should be more quests in clash of code
 Gabbek: The differences can be massive - so you would probably want to optimize it quite heavily. Make sure your game state is as small as possible while still having all required info for you. If you can change any kind of container to an int - go for it, it'll be much better.
 AntonCosmin: If I am using a class called Ingredients for which I have overriden the operators so that I can add to ingredients and get a new ingredients as a return...I guess this takes some time, because I use new for every operation with ingredients I do...
 Zenoscave: bah I'm super low now
 Zenoscave: Probably time to not ignore opp
 CommanderCero: yep that will take a lot of time
 Zenoscave: Not really Just need to change my search so that it can check against an argument for casts. instead of hardcoded
 Zenoscave: Just realized you were talking to the message above mine..
 CommanderCero: sorry xD
 Gabbek: don't worry Zeno&#160;:) congrats on gold!
 Zenoscave: Thanks!
 Gabbek: I guess I'll try to fight for atleast gold and call it a day afterwards
 Zenoscave: Can you do beam search with an array? I'm struggling with that
 CommanderCero: yeah use an heap
 CommanderCero: and 2 arrays
 Gabbek: I admire your persistence - I've been way too lazy in last days. Never tried beam search with an array, been using heap in the past
 Zenoscave: why 2? CommanderCero
 Zenoscave: for curent next level?
 CommanderCero: one for the old states, and one for the new states
 Zenoscave: got it
 CommanderCero: the new states should be represented as heap
 CommanderCero: so you dont need to sort
 Zenoscave: I do similar but I have GC issues.
 mlemm: submission takes time more than the coding it self
 reCurse: Contest victim of its own popularity
 reCurse: Reminds me of hypersonic 3 years ago
 reCurse: No way 4 years? Time flies&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: I was thinking it was more than 3... 
 Zenoscave: Bah no Heap/Prioirty Queue in C# 
 eulerscheZahl: that HS submit with 4 player games and 100ms per turn
 eulerscheZahl: some slow submits
 eulerscheZahl: i've missed that a few times too Zenoscave
 Gabbek: Zeno - let me find a link for you, got it lying around somewhere, but it's probably slow.
 Mohammed_R_Jmili: hi
 numb3r5: hello
 Zenoscave: I'll just write one eulerscheZahl
 dbf: Switch to java then, we have timeouts and priority queue also
 Zenoscave: lol dbf
 Illedan: haha
 RockyMullet: no free gold for me, rip, I'll have to fix my bot haha
 RockyMullet: 188th in silver, no way I drift
 Gabbek: good lucky Rocky, you'll make it!
 RockyMullet: how many in gold&#160;? 200 or something&#160;?
 NinjaDoggy: 152
 numb3r5: how many ranks are there?
 reCurse: That would be a bigger drift than changing an election
 RockyMullet: oh, maybe the resubmit made get some points
 RockyMullet: reCurse lol
 Zenoscave: reCurse It's scary times now. 
 reCurse: Sorry inappropriate mood swing
 reCurse: Let's move on
 Zenoscave: will you be competing at all reCurse?
 Zenoscave: still time to pull a NinjaDoggy
 Zenoscave: and get legend in a day
 reCurse: I'm either not participating, hiding or smurfing
 dbf: legend from single submit (and 4 hours of waiting)
 RockyMullet: I'm like 7 or 8th in canada now so... I dont care anymore reCurse, I'll allow your presence :P
 reCurse: Oh finally
 RockyMullet: since I know it was the only thing holding you
 llllllllll: any way to debug segfaults in c++?Try catch prints nothing, traping SIGSEGV did nothing... I don't want to debug locally :C
 reCurse: segfaults are not a c++ exception
 llllllllll: I was just trying to find anything helpful, nothing really worked
 struct: locally is the only real way
 Zenoscave: truly
 llllllllll: ah, crap
 reCurse: There's also firing printf in your code like a homicidal maniac with a shotgun

 Gabbek: I think I found it somewhere, so you most likely found something very similar if not identical.
 mlemm: what's the max depth you've achieved with bfs guys&#160;?
 ClockSort: i'm getting full BFS depth around 6 to 8 looking at only BREW and CAST, using C#
 rmuskovets: I achieved "no depth limit" with my *really* crappy dfs
 mlemm: depends how you define *really* crappy but i got the idea, and reaching dfs's full depth is less challenging than bf's isn't
 Quidome: What do you mean by achieving no depth limit?
 rmuskovets: I don't set one
 fel-hita: im pretty sure he means max with no error handling
 Quidome: so you calculate every state possible in a turn?
 fel-hita: timeout*
 rmuskovets: Quidome yes
 Quidome: How many states do you visit?
 Quidome: on average?
 rmuskovets: idk
 Quidome: I really don't see how you can do that
 Quidome: in 50 ms
 wlesavo: probably stop at first buy then
 llllllllll: I do ~20k nodes
 fel-hita: Quidome i think it's quite possible with a really light bfs, but he said his was crappy 
 fel-hita: dfs* sry
 rmuskovets: it's not like a slow one, it generates bad actions
 Quidome: curious how many states that are
 fel-hita: can you check @rmuskovets, let us now.
 Quidome: To check my assumptions :P
 rmuskovets: btw what do you mean by state? inventory state or possible recipe?
 rmuskovets: @fel-hita ok
 Quidome: For every action you simulate you got a new state
 rmuskovets: aha, ok
 miszu: gonna try to do java without hitting gc. brb preparing rope
 Quidome: fast games are 30 levels deep or so, that would me to much to simuate
 rmuskovets: there's definitely smth bad in my code: it only generated 29 (!) nodes
 rmuskovets: unique nodes*
 Quidome: :D
 rmuskovets: thats probably the reason of the bad moves
 rmuskovets: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505388026">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505388026</a>
 rmuskovets: here you can see how bad it is
 Quidome: and why you think you had no depth limit
 rmuskovets: because I didn't set one!
 rmuskovets: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6415cadd-8b9c-468c-b89e-14aeb7a46f8c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6415cadd-8b9c-468c-b89e-14aeb7a46f8c</a>
 rmuskovets: this is my code for the DFS
 rmuskovets: it just looked like a DFS for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: got a notification about gold opening, schedule says a time...but what timezone?  Does CG know my timezone?
 rmuskovets: I think either +0 or your TZ
 rmuskovets: @Quidome how's it to you?
 Quidome: at least you did one delivery :D
 rmuskovets: and boss did 5
 fel-hita: why didn't you go for bfs rmusko&#160;? :smile:
 rmuskovets: what's the difference?
 MadKnight: so i creatednew BinaryReader(new MemoryStream())
 fel-hita: dfs will get you the fastest path
 MadKnight: do i have to call dispose on those&#160;?
 rmuskovets: looks like I actually do a BFS
 fel-hita: yeah bfs is definitely the pick between them both, it may be costy but worth it with a decent optimization, goodlulck buddy
 fel-hita: i meant dfs and not"why didn't you go for bfs rmusko&#160;?", spelled them too much this week
 rmuskovets: looks like I get a timeout when using DFS-like code (queue.unshift instead of queue.push)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rmuskovets maybe I'm reading your code wrong, but it looks like the path length is always 1, so your path only gets set on the first one it finds... maybe I'm wrong... I dunno
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rmuskovets it's not going after the quickest, that's fer sure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a similar routine, but I return path length, first element of path, and $/length of the best of the 5 according to a passed criteria....do i want it quick or do I want it pricey.
 miszu: question for java. the actionType is a String input and string are immutable. So everytime I read it, it creates extra object in heap thus GC could be triggered. How you avoid using a string here?
 LordSkaven: make it an enum or int
 LordSkaven: unless you mean reading it instead of storing it. 
 miszu: thing is, when you read the input, it returns a string: scanner.next()
 miszu: yeah talking about reading it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rmuskovets add the nodes to the queue after your neighbor loop, otherwise you are only gonna find the first in that first castable
 LordSkaven: mmm yeah then I have no ideas
 jacek: fifty states
 jacek: argh not scrolled
 ParticleBeam: Hmm. Going to have to up my bot
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jacek are you in silver?  can't find u
 miszu: Is there a way to avoid using string for actionType?
 ParticleBeam: What do you mean? Recode it as a number when you read the inputs in
 miszu: I am coding it in java. The scanner.next() returns a String so it is bad for the java gc. Is there a way to avoid using string?
 eulerscheZahl: these few strings are you smallest problem. a simulation creating thousands of nodes is a much better problem
 AntiSquid: is sinofwrath the boss&#160;?
 AntiSquid: (silver)
 eulerscheZahl: no
 AntiSquid: do you know who it is then?
 Ccleetus: Does anybody know a puzzle for beginners in Lua?

 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 Ccleetus: Thank you!
 pedrosorio: I converted my bot from Python to Java thinking it was going to be so fast and awesome, turns out GC in Java ssssssucks and makes it timeout every time, had to some dirty hacks to keep object creation to a minimum
 aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding</a> this for total beginning
 aCat: and start with puzzles WITHOUT user accounts
 AntiSquid: ya see leaderboard, it's either rust or c++ pedrosorio :P
 aCat: they are more fun / more grapic / better made
 phord: @eulerscheZahl  timing-related  segfault?  Are you multithreading?
 eulerscheZahl: simulating the opponent first and then me
 eulerscheZahl: opponent took too long, so i had 0 moves for myself
 phord: ah.
 AntiSquid: python on #36 :O
 pedrosorio: I mean, my Java bot is about to get promoted to gold, I think (38% battles it's at #14 in silver), but if I have to do dirty hacks might as well code it in C++, yeah -- 2nd rewrite, here I come lol
 AntiSquid: python for quick bronze and then c++ is usually best imo 
 pedrosorio: ah... lesson learned
 llllllllll: yeah, definitely
 Falkor: msg toma25 Why are you win me always with the same score :p
 ClockSort: before gold opened, i was rank 80 silver. now i'm rank 35 gold (no changes to code). is this normal?
 CommanderCero: well im still rank ~130 before and after gold
 pedrosorio: ClockSort does your bot occasionally lose against really bad bots? 
 ClockSort: I haven't particularly noticed that
 NinjaDoggy: my bot is finally... BUG FREE!!!
 NinjaDoggy: (i think...)
 reCurse: Quiet fool! That's when they're coming
 goolmoos: No bugs is actually bad
 goolmoos: because if they are no bugs to resolve, how will you improve?
 goolmoos: *there
 NinjaDoggy: yep... they just showed up&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: thanks reCurse
 NinjaDoggy: I have a to do list...&#160;:(
 NinjaDoggy: I just can't work on new features when current ones are broken lol
 Astrobytes: Don't confuse bugs with poor/sub-optimal strategy goolmoos
 NinjaDoggy: luckily... every time i've fixed a bug
 NinjaDoggy: my bot got better&#160;:)
 goolmoos: It was a joke
 miszu: question all: is it worth doing a solution in java for bronze and up? Or should I go for C++ instead?
 NinjaDoggy: you can get really high up with java
 NinjaDoggy: I got 3rd once with it :D
 NinjaDoggy: but generally, the higher you go the more worth it is to swap to C++
 miszu: :D what position you are now?
 NinjaDoggy: 3rd as in end of contest(for another contest)
 miszu: ohh okay
 NinjaDoggy: I peaked like top 10 this contest with java
 NinjaDoggy: it was really early on though so..
 miszu: I am just worried that GC in java will slap a timeout to my face
 NinjaDoggy: it does
 NinjaDoggy: swapping to C++ feels sooo good
 NinjaDoggy: always 45-47 ms a turn
 NinjaDoggy: never time out
 NinjaDoggy: in java... 35-55 ms a turn
 NinjaDoggy: timeout 1/20
 NinjaDoggy:&#160;:(
 miszu: why they don't increase the timeout for java? It would help java devs
 NinjaDoggy: hard to make every langugage "fair"
 miszu: yeah but then it's like saying in order to compete in higher level, you must use X language
 NinjaDoggy: waaay too much work to balance every language though...
 NinjaDoggy: and would result in longer game times
 miszu: I guess so
 pedrosorio: miszu I converted my bot from Python to Java, it was a pain to get rid of the GC timeouts, but now it works
 reCurse: There's a big forum thread explaining why it's a terrible idea
 KevinisMAD: Yeah my bfs gets to depth of about 7 or 8 so I am working on how to trim without cutting good paths
 miszu: my c++ is rusty. Time to refresh it
 KevinisMAD: If I can't trim my python enough by like 6 I am going to learn cpp and implement it
 wlesavo: my c++ is pythonish, thats worse
 pedrosorio: Also, can we make the bots get out of the league a bit quicker? Mine has been comfortably above the boss since 30% and it's still waiting to get promoted at 70% an hour later xD
 NinjaDoggy: @wlesavo :joy:
 reCurse: The real issue is slow submit because the contest is ridiculously popular
 NinjaDoggy: yea...
 miszu: C++ = RAII + lvalue + rvalue + core dumps
 NinjaDoggy: can we donate CPU time to servers?
 NinjaDoggy: I would gladly donate a few cores to make things run faster...
 reCurse: I mentioned a submit fast pass monetization option on discord, but I doubt they'll listen to my genius idea :p
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 NinjaDoggy: it does sound pretty genius&#160;;)
 struct: Just like lichess
 struct: use users cpu for analysis
 NinjaDoggy: yea :D
 eulerscheZahl: tshirt merchandising would bring a few bucks as well. i saw some users ask if it's possible to buy them
 NinjaDoggy: but that...
 Astrobytes: One of the better monetization ideas I've heard regarding CG
 reCurse: Then they would run out of special prizes
 reCurse: The real tshirt value is its rarity
 NinjaDoggy: that takes away from the glory of top 20&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: t-shirts nah
 eulerscheZahl: true
 eulerscheZahl: buying and winning is not the same
 Astrobytes: fast-track submits might not generate enough though
 Astrobytes: Well, mind you in a contest like this...
 eulerscheZahl: showing ads before every 10th replay
 eulerscheZahl: i know :door:
 eulerscheZahl: i would hate that myself
 Astrobytes: Banished.
 reCurse: Can a mod ban another mod
 reCurse: Let's find out
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: but are you faster than me?
 reCurse: Duel outside in 10 minutes
 phord: There are prizes?
 eulerscheZahl: good night
 eulerscheZahl: 20 tshirts, 3 canvases
 phord: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: a fair reward for a full week of hard work
 phord: :laughing:
 reCurse: The real reward is the friends we make along the way
 inoryy: aww
 NinjaDoggy: awww ofcourse&#160;:)
 JBence: reBlessing
 reCurse: Eh, reminds me of my reBlessed smurf (not on cg)
 NinjaDoggy: how do I have a bug tracking the number of potions I've brewed -_-
 JBence: don't drink your own potions, rule #1
 NinjaDoggy: oh nvm... I don't, my opponent ended the game and I won
 KevinisMAD: By the way are y'all recalculating best path at ever cast?
 denik1981: I'm new on Codingame ...Can someone help me figure out why I don't have Coding Points even that I solve a few exercises?
 denik1981: I shows 0 in the leaderboard
 denik1981: it
 reCurse: Puzzles don't award CP
 denik1981: Clash of Code??
 firehell: @kevinisMAD i have the same question in mind 
 aCat: tehy are updated onece per day
 aCat: *they
 denik1981: I realized that .. so I solve a Clash of Code exercise and still nothing .. 
 firehell: 50 ms by turn is'nt enough
 denik1981: Ahh .. so I will have to wait
 aCat: there should be visible tomorrow morning i guess
 aCat: yep
 reCurse: You want 24 hour submits instead? :p
 struct: I want 150ms just like CSB old days
 reCurse: Good old 8 hour submits
 pedrosorio: struct than they have to limit the competition to fewer than 6k people, or get more servers :D
 VirtuaL42: Having issues to get a correct circuit breaking to handle timeouts (c++). At some point the referee is killing me for not responding (like at 18ms mark). Is there any tricks or things to be aware of&#160;?&#160;:/
 Counterbalance: you could run it offline on the turn that times out and see if it aborts timely. Could be you're not checking for timeout often enough
 VirtuaL42: what i thought but i'm fine locally and i put checks everywhere with logs just to be sur i was not stuck in a long loop somewhere.
 Counterbalance: if you log too much data that can also be considered a timeout
 VirtuaL42: reduced but it seems the same. I'm using chrono::high_resolution_clock::now could it be wrong&#160;?
 Counterbalance: i'm using that too, works fine.
 VirtuaL42: damn ok&#160;:(
 SAChamp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/572391469495f4f007323ae10613055c9602">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/572391469495f4f007323ae10613055c9602</a>
 Counterbalance: you start measuring after you read the 1st line of input? And you're using something like chrono::duration_cast&lt;chrono::microseconds&gt;(elapsed).count()&#160;?
 SAChamp: Check this out! Suggestions are welcome
 SAChamp: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/572391469495f4f007323ae10613055c9602">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/572391469495f4f007323ae10613055c9602</a>
 VirtuaL42: yes but i see that i'm using nanos and dividing it by 1 million, perhaps some rounding issue
 RockyMullet: great all my lost are random timeouts, I feel the servers a trolling me
 struct: How many time do you use rocky?
 jacek: all the time
 RockyMullet: I stop my sim at 39 ms
 ShadowJ24: Hello, why doesnt my AI quest map doesn't update even though I've done the tutorial on Coders Strike Back?
 RockyMullet: ok resubmitted and my losts are actual lost
 RockyMullet: ShadowJ24 you need to click it to "claim" it
 llllllllll: I also stop at 45 ms, but I don't think it's the servers
 RockyMullet: I like blaming others for my mistakes :D
 ShadowJ24: When I click it it just goes to the page of Coders Strike back...
 RockyMullet: oh god, seems like it wasnt a good time to submit
 RockyMullet: 1 game past the initial 10...
 struct: yeah rocky
 RockyMullet: :sleepy:
 ClockSort: rockymullet could it be the GC?
 RockyMullet: but my bot is better&#160;! :cry:
 Counterbalance: i use micros and divide by 1000.. could be, yeah..
 Counterbalance: (crap scroll)
 fel-hita: writing c# in this IDE is painful
 fel-hita: everybody just copy pasta&#160;?
 RockyMullet: second game, progress&#160;!
 struct: There are extensions fel-hita to sync
 RockyMullet: fel-hita yeah code somewhere else locally on your computer
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/codingame-sync-beta/614/</a>
 RockyMullet: if you like your sanity
 ClockSort: fel-hita yeah i use VS and paste it in
 fel-hita: many thanks
 LogalogScholar: We're coding not being sane here
 LordSkaven: same here
 struct: I could not imagine coding more than 50 lines on this ide
 RockyMullet: 3 games&#160;! All wins at least :D
 ClockSort: there are tools to combine your files, but I'm not afraid of a measly thousand lines.
 RockyMullet: struct I did some small easy puzzles when learning a new language
 RockyMullet: but thats it
 struct: clock sometimes it happens that you accidently paste in chat
 struct: and do not notice
 RockyMullet: 4th game, a win also, I guess there's more anticipation that way lol
 fel-hita: maybe the games are very intense that's why its ranking slowly :laughing:
 RockyMullet: hype overload
 RockyMullet: 16% patience is a virtue
 struct: just need to wait around 2 hours maybe
 tobk: wow, crept up to gold from silver 65. did not expect that.
 numb3r5: hello evryone
 ClockSort: hello numb3r5
 miszu: do you get big advantage by stuffing all 4 inventories into one int?
 ClockSort: i can't figure out how to subtract costs and determine unaffordability after stuffing deltas into a single int
 struct: I ditched from storing all in one int
 struct: I had a bug
 struct: Noticed it by luck
 ClockSort: why not fix bug?&#160;:)
 miszu: I guess keep it simple is a good advice
 Skynse: Yall ever have one of the test cases fail but you get 100%
 PED: struct I did all on GitC in this ide ^^
 struct: How?
 Vinay96: does anything change in silver?
 struct: no
 Vinay96: so what's the point?
 Vinay96: i'm so confused
 PED: Obstination mostly I suppose
 Astrobytes: And that was the older version of the IDE!
 PED: also I didn't know about CG sync
 struct: Vinay96 to increase competition
 Astrobytes: It means the best players go through to next league, so people are competing with people at the right level.
 Astrobytes: @Vinay96
 Vinay96: Makes sense! - Cheers Guys
 starmaq: hmm the ide is pretty drunk 
 starmaq: test cases are taking ages to test, and the output is always finding Nothing 
 starmaq: started working again out of a sudden
 fel-hita: better avoid using the embedded IDE<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-ext/ldjnbdgcceengbjkalemckffhaajkehd?hl=en">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codingame-sync-ext/ldjnbdgcceengbjkalemckffhaajkehd?hl=en</a>
 fel-hita: i was doing the same painful mistake
 miszu: I need some inspiration for a class name. How do you call all the spells/potions/tome?
 LordSkaven: Thing0,Thing1, Thing2, Thing3
 SelectNull: Action
 PatrickMcGinnisII: never gonna get out of silver with this bot, gotta rewrite&#160;:(
 miszu: yeah action sounds resonable
 BrunoFelthes: any ideas to rank the tomes?
 Braykin08: BrunoFelthes my tip is the same for every problem you are trying to solve&#160;: What are you lacking, improve there. Diversity, quantity, how fast can you cast them
 ParticleBeam: I've rewritten my bot multiple times. I seem to have hit my limit.
 LogalogScholar: Nothing like seeing your ranking dropping 6500 places
 miszu: I am in bronze and I am rewriting in C++. By just outputing "WAIT" I am beating many opponents. I guess you can actually win by doing nothing.
 KevinisMAD: The heuristic for choosing the next spell to cast is killing me
 pedrosorio: ParticleBeam neverrrrrr give up
 LogalogScholar: Nothing like waiting for your opponent to self destruct
 KevinisMAD: Honestly some of the people towards the top must be crazy good at coming up with ideas I am almost completely out I can't even add the options for repeating cast because my bfs isn't fast enough to have that help
 LogalogScholar: It all boils down to optimization I think as you get higher up.
 MarekM: deltas
 TC9792: beating the boss in silver league probably does not require bfs/minimax
 TC9792: a good heuristic function for your action in this turn might be good enough
 KevinisMAD: Probably not  but I got to about rank 1200 and couldn't push pass that without it 
 Zenoscave: TC9792 Yes but that definitely won't scale
 KevinisMAD: Although I just found a bug in my code which is helping a ton
 TC9792: I am at the middle of silve league , just using heuristic function for current turn, without casting spell repeatedly
 TC9792: but ya, if you want to get into the top, you need optimized minimax
 Zenoscave: Middle silver to gold is a big leap... Think you'll be able to continue
 miszu: how far can you go in this tournament without simulations? ie: compute the best move without looking in future?
 Zenoscave: and minimax doesn't work well in simultaneous games
 Kaa: can I test somehow 2 different versions of my algo?
 Zenoscave: submit one and play against it in ide with the other
 Zenoscave: or submit both and see how they do
 Kaa: Can I add my previous algo in ide?
 Zenoscave: yes if you enable expert mode in the settings
 TC9792: I will start building game search algorithm if I cant advance my position anymore
 Zenoscave: on the left panel
 Kaa: hmm... its on expert
 Scarfield: remember to backup current code, if you havent submitted it yet
 TC9792: I already have the heuristic function
 Kaa: found. thank you
 TC9792: what are you planning otherwise? if not a minimax with alpha beta pruning
 ScriptKiddie0101: is 496 good rank?
 TC9792: it is a very common approach for 1v1 game
 Zenoscave: BFS is popular rn
 Zenoscave: it's a common approach for turn alternative 1v1 games
 TC9792: ya true
 Kaa: oh... after reading you... I feel I'll never be promoted to gold league (
 Zenoscave: don't give up Kaa!
 TC9792: errichto was doing DP during his last live stream
 Zenoscave: Many people in Gold use only BFS. Just need to choose wisely where to search
 AntiSquid: DP&#160;?
 Scarfield: do you have any pruning kaa?
 Zenoscave: Dynamic Programming
 Zenoscave: TC9792 was it based on knapsack?
 Zhmyh: How do you guys select parameters (or weights if you like)?Like I have ~10 weights and it's impossible for me to choose them well.Are there any lifehacks or is smb using some kind of primitive neural networks for this?
 TC9792: ya knapsack
 AntiSquid: errichto still in bronze though
 Zenoscave: interesting i'll look into it for heurstic meta
 Scarfield: yea what a n00b he is :p
 AntiSquid: yup 
 Kaa: I have already asked it... but I don't remember the answer...Is there an ID number bound?
 TC9792: not a lot of time you can beat Errichto haha
 AntiSquid: seriously, he might change his approach entirely Scarfield
 TC9792: for now
 KevinisMAD: Errichto said he was going to work more on this tomorrow so who knows whatll happen
 Scarfield: i havent seen his streams, but is he even participating for real, or just to make a tutorial out of it?
 AntiSquid: he is going for legend
 Zenoscave: How many legend y'all think? 20-30?
 KevinisMAD: Yeah the thing is he has some other coding competitions he wanted to do more or something like that
 TC9792: he streamed 5,6 hrs on this
 Scarfield: i guess there is a limit for how much he will be allowed to stream during the contest then?
 AntiSquid: 20 imo Zenoscave, but apparently saiksy said in chat it will be 15 so ...
 AntiSquid: that's official right? 
 Scarfield: it has been 15 the last few times i think
 Zenoscave: only 15!?
 Zenoscave: Christ
 Astrobytes: errichto finally got the CG bug properly
 Scarfield: AstroBug
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/505563320">https://www.codingame.com/replay/505563320</a>
 Zenoscave: sad
 Astrobytes: Scarfasterthanme :D
 Scarfield: lol zeno, 2 green &gt; 1 yellos obviously
 Scarfield: yellow *
 AntiSquid: 2-3 hours later and still sub running
 Zenoscave: I don't add count to final score yet
 Scarfield: how normal are draws up there?
 Zenoscave: only had 1/35 against sim.an so far
 SinOfWrath: That's sad Zeno on the replay. In silver I had a 6 streak loss during submit where I had the resources for a potion and the enemy finished on that turn and I would have won in the next turn.
 Zenoscave: I lost simply for having one less teir-1+ in inventory at the end lol
 fel-hita: that's why i keep one under my sleeves
 Scarfield: 5 aces?
 Astrobytes: fel-hita or mlemm... it keeps changing depending on my browser tab lol
 Zenoscave: lol Scarcheat
 Astrobytes: Missed the obvious there Zeno: ScarfAce
 Scarfield: Platoscave, ive never been caught
 Scarfield: uuh
 Whiskee: if I get "Warning: your code did not read all available input" but I'm breaking after just 20ms, does it mean I'm hitting memory limits?
 Scarfield: "Say hello to ma lit'le fren"
 MarekM: hi, action_id change from LEARN to CAST after learning it is random?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Also Scarfield: "Platoscave" :rofl:
 Scarfield: Whiskee could be you error print too much (it takes time) 
 Whiskee: oh
 Scarfield: yea i always think of that when i see zenos name
 Astrobytes: What about poor Socrates
 Scarfield: hmm i dont remember him having a cave? :thinking:
 Whiskee: I disable all logging, error goes away, I re-enable it, it doesn't come back
 Whiskee: aaaaa
 Whiskee: why is this so inconsistent
 Astrobytes: No he didn't but he read Zenos no?
 Astrobytes: Or studied him or something.
 Astrobytes: *Zeno
 Scarfield: plato was socrates student, i dont remember who zeno is actually
 Scarfield: was * :p
 KevinisMAD: By the way is gold open?
 DomiKo: yes finnaly sim is done!!!
 Astrobytes: My Greek philosophy is lacking. He was pre-Socrates I know that much.
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zeno-elea/</a> LMGTFY&#160;!!111
 Scarfield: just googled, can confirm
 AntiSquid: too late, entire chat got lmgtfy-ed&#160;!
 struct: Are servers slower?
 struct: My code performs worse without changes
 AntiSquid: too many bots? :P
 AntiSquid: 6.3k already 
 reCurse: 500 active submissions
 struct: Yeah, but I was wondering if it could affect on IDE aswell
 reCurse: It's the same farm
 AntiSquid: CG getting wrecked for real this time
 Astrobytes: KevinisMAD: yep
 Illedan: No problem AntiSquid. These submits wont be done until contest is over
 Astrobytes: And yeah, IDE performance is a bit meh too
 struct: Im surprised it is handling this load tbh
 Astrobytes: How many now?
 struct: players?
 reCurse: The only difference in load is it takes 3 hours to handle a submit and there's no downtime
 Astrobytes: Was ~6200 last I checked, yeah
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS</a> just look here astro @_@
 AntiSquid: that's nuts 
 Astrobytes: No I meant total AntiSquid, and I cba to actually look myself frankly
 struct: 6364
 AntiSquid: 6360 total . maybe this contest does reach 7k
 AntiSquid: 4 new users in 5 minutes? someone making alts? or just popular&#160;?
 Astrobytes: There's the streaming thing, and Errichto
 struct: And japanese tweets
 Astrobytes: That spreads word across the CP community for a start
 AntiSquid: then just need few of the real big streamers to kill CG
 Astrobytes: yeah struct
 Astrobytes: Also the contest is quite CP-community friendly in a lot of ways I guess
 DomiKo: that contest is Bit-opti friendly
 DomiKo: that sim is super cool
 meh1001: Whats CP stand for? Obviously I'm not in whatever community that i slol
 Scarfield: Cyber P**n
 Astrobytes: Sorry, CP == Competitive Programming
 Astrobytes: topcoder, codeforces etc type stuff
 KevinisMAD: Yea it is a bad term just think of child p***....
 KevinisMAD: Like pick a better name cmon
 AntiSquid: CP = computer programming :P
 reCurse: Yeah like anyone sensibly minded would think of that upon seeing CP
 meh1001: rofl! that one didn't cross my mind, I was thinking 'C programmers' as my best guess 
 reCurse: Grow up
 Astrobytes: ^
 AntiSquid: this isn't a news site true
 Astrobytes: So anyway, since this contest seems to lean more in the direction of single player optim, it's more attractive to the CP community in general
 Astrobytes: So I think that's a factor
 sirsatan: is there copy module&#160;?
 Scarfield: that segway xD
 miszu: what you mean singple player optim?
 Astrobytes: *segue Scarfield segue!
 Scarfield: xD
 Zenoscave: wait it isn't spelled segway?
 Zenoscave: or cegway?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization</a> miszu there's a full category with just optimizing for better score
 sirsatan: i want use deepcopy (python3) 
 Astrobytes: EcksDee yourself :P
 Astrobytes: "Cegway" lel
 JFB: sirsatan: copy.deepcopy()&#160;:-)
 Zenoscave: the cegway is asking . where is ceg btw
 Astrobytes: No Zeno, it's segue
 Astrobytes: He's around
 AntiSquid: oh ceg did join, i wasn't around enough this time to see him
 reCurse: Didn't you notice the statement copied almost verbatim to the webchat?
 sirsatan: JFB thanks i missed copy.copy in other phrase
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: he asked almost as much as always :p but apparently actually read some of the statement for once
 Astrobytes: And his sister is competing too iirc
 Scarfield: segueprakash?
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 Astrobytes: Anyway. Still smurfing around reCurse?&#160;:)
 reCurse: Who knows
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Zenoscave: so yes
 reCurse: There's a rumor going around that timeouts are happening across the board as a result of managed language activists seeing to equalize the field
 Zenoscave: how would managed languages increase opp timeouts?
 Zenoscave: or do you mean in general
 reCurse: In general
 Zenoscave: Unsafe assumption on my part
 reCurse: They cried about balance and CG just injected random GC spikes to everyone
 Zenoscave: I was unaware of this
 Astrobytes: tbf the spikes have been pretty bad for a few months (at least)
 reCurse: Is my trolling too subtle or yours even more
 Zenoscave: We will say the latter...
 Astrobytes: And no, I think we got it
 struct: I believed you for a sec
 Zenoscave: I did for more than a sec
 struct: I even googled what was managed languages
 AntiSquid: too close to reality 
 Zenoscave: Gullible and trusting. that's me
 Zenoscave: C# java etc struct
 reCurse: Just wait until I reveal ceg was my smurf all along
 Scarfield: xD
 Zenoscave: I'd be pissed
 Astrobytes: lel
 ZarthaxX: no way
 ZarthaxX: you cant act so ceglike
 Zenoscave: Also how can one reveal a smurf?

 Astrobytes: Or have you?
 AntiSquid: god that's awful . 
 Zenoscave: Why are you all so suspicious of the world. face value. it does wonders
 Scarfield: or does it?
 reCurse: Face value. On the internet.
 Zenoscave: ^ should have seen that comming
 Astrobytes: "Face value. On the internet." &lt;- 
 Zenoscave: Why do you think so many nigerian princes talk to me
 Zenoscave: Because I trust people
 AntiSquid: thispersondoesnotexist = one of the best face value websites out there
 reCurse: What's your email again?
 Zenoscave: whose mine?
 reCurse: Yes
 struct: Wow
 struct: The accountant winner is playing on this contest
 Zenoscave: lol I'm dumb but not that dumb
 struct: had no clue
 Astrobytes: l**esmi*h@zenoscaveswebsite.com
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/s3zjRcMnRNY?t=88">https://youtu.be/s3zjRcMnRNY?t=88</a> this is you zeno?
 Zenoscave: maybe
 AntiSquid: the amazon support guy that keeps calling started to sound geniune
 AntiSquid: more genuine ... not really there yet
 Zenoscave: I get car insurance department calls
 Zenoscave: that's the company name "Car insurance dept."
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I think I found foul proof way to find re curse alt
 struct: Just invite everyone to CoC until you get banned
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: would defo work if euler is using an alt
 AntiSquid: just mention amnezia from the car accident, tell them to give you the details, or ask stupid questions, mentioned bikes, 3 wheelers, etc  they'll stop calling and tell you're not a customer anymore 
 Astrobytes: But the alt isn't a moderator (OR IS IT?!)
 reCurse: Jokes on you I have more than 1 alt
 The_Auditor: is Automato2000 still arround?
 Scarfield: no
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a very simple code to see the best path to the list of the resul
 The_Auditor: is Automaton2000 still arround?
 icecream17: (test) automaton2000
 Automaton2000: the challenge is to get it
 Automaton2000: i thought my bot was kinda smart, but it's not working for me
 Astrobytes: I suspect you have one per contest reCurse. It's what I'd do anyway&#160;;)
 reCurse: Maybe.
 icecream17: i wonder how often automaton2000 pings someone
 Scarfield: why use an alt though? is being a mod online during contest a hazzle or whats the reason?
 Automaton2000: looking forward to the next league
 reCurse: Too stressful
 Astrobytes: If the contest isn't something you like or whatever then you can ditch it
 struct: If he wants to quit he can always delete the smurf
 Astrobytes: (I'm not using an alt btw, my rank is really that bad)
 reCurse: It's totally a flaw it's just how I cope with it
 Scarfield: im still just doing random action, hopefully tomorrow i will get further
 struct: I dont have anything against it
 Astrobytes: It's not a flaw at all.
 Scarfield: but why make an alt, you could just quit, or does joining with your main put on pressure to perform. Im just curious btw
 Astrobytes: We're all human at the end of the day.
 Scarfield: or ..
 Astrobytes: yeah yeah
 reCurse: I feel obligated to perform and it tilts me when people read into a bad performance or whatever
 reCurse: With an alt I can just delete and move on
 Scarfield: makes sense
 AntiSquid: taking it too personally
 reCurse: Yeah
 struct: I dont think you need to prove anything
 struct: But w/e its your choice afterall
 Astrobytes: Yeah but you can't always force yourself to believe that struct
 struct: Yeah, I understand
 struct: I dont wanted to sound harsh
 Astrobytes: Subconsciously I mean
 reCurse: Getting too emotionally invested has been my biggest flaw in competitive endeavors
 Astrobytes: No you didn't struct
 Scarfield: luckily i dont have that kind of pressure on me xD
 reCurse: At this point I give up on changing that :P
 struct: Well your 1 day bot could beat my 30 day bot
 struct: What rank do you usually aim for re curse?
 reCurse: 1
 struct: 1st? or top N?
 struct: damn
 Scarfield: makes me wonder how hard it would be to rank as the very last. Timing out every match might not work
 reCurse: Server-side rng for matchmaking
 Scarfield: isnt there actually an award in tour de france for finished 2nd last?
 struct: no
 struct: you are the 1st loser
 struct: thats about it
 agenordebriat: Finishing is a feat in itself
 agenordebriat: Might not be the case here... :D
 struct: There is Yellow jersey (general time winner), Green jersey(ponts), Dot jersey(Mountain points), White Jersey(youth general time)
 struct: Time to port tdf game here
 Scarfield: Lanterne rouge is the very last to finish, for some reason remembered it as the 2nd last
 struct: Didnt know it existed
 struct: The name is funny
 Scarfield: "refers to the red lantern hung on the rear vehicle of a passenger railway train"
 avdg: hmm not sure if some are doing sim, I did not track chat so far
 avdg: doing my sim version and it seems expensive&#160;:-)
 ZarthaxX: yes, people is doing sim
 struct: I dont think its that expensive
 struct: If you are simming both
 struct: maybe
 avdg: I need to trace my bottlenecks
 avdg: and cut out some calculations
 avdg: code is just a few hours old
 avdg: though I didnt spend too much time coding, my non-sim version reached top of bronze
 struct: How do I stop early optimizations? It's my biggest problem.
 avdg: tackle the problem big enough from the start
 avdg: if you take the challenge big enough, you only have to focus on the little ones
 Bobbadillio: In the sense that you're trying to write optimized code early, and then it becomes too slow to update?
 avdg: though it is an recursive thingy
 Astrobytes: Forget intrinsics exist struct, there are none. There is no AVX. Your code is pure.
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 struct: Bobbadillio I keep trying to optimize early and keep rewriting
 struct: im stuck on a loop
 struct: No way im gonna use AVX here
 Astrobytes: But you're doing lots of bitwise optimisations prematurely I would guess
 JohnCM: it seems like i must make 6 potions under 45 turns to win silver boss
 struct: well I saw top brewing 6 under 30
 struct: So 45 seems feasible
 JohnCM: how??
 struct: Astrobytes I dont even know what im doing anymore
 JohnCM: brew under 30
 avdg: hmm my sim does about 1000-1500 iterations at the start
 JohnCM: that is nuts
 avdg: but crashes after a few turns
 ZarthaxX: F
 Bobbadillio: What's an iteration avdg? a full rollout through a game, or something else?
 avdg: a move in a sim
 Bobbadillio: Ah, cool
 ZarthaxX: Astrobytes you cant stop structo from optimizing
 struct: continue;
 ZarthaxX: he always ignores the phrase "optimization is the root of all evil"
 ZarthaxX: struct LOL
 struct: That is not how I exit an infinite loop is it?
 ZarthaxX: how is that efficient sim going anyway
 ZarthaxX: break;
 ZarthaxX: mah man
 Bobbadillio: haha, I mean, it's ONE way to get it done&#160;;)
 Bobbadillio: wait, no it's not
 Bobbadillio: actually, I wrote that bug earlier
 JohnCM: i see it now
 Bobbadillio: in my own code
 ZarthaxX: loooooooooool
 JohnCM: silver boss uses repeatable spells
 JohnCM: i don't
 Astrobytes: lol ZarthaxX :D
 avdg: my can, but my non-sim can only do so limited
 avdg: *mine
 struct: ZarthaxX that is not helping my optimization addiction
 ZarthaxX: :D
 avdg: it only makes it a bit slower I guess
 ZarthaxX: lang?
 avdg: lang of my ai?
 struct: TS
 avdg: yeah TS
 struct: ok no more optimizations
 struct: until I reach gold
 avdg: I guess my code should be better written in a non-gc and a bit more optimized datastructure
 AbundantPuddle: But if there are no more optimizations, then your code won't be optimized.
 avdg: -O0 all the way?
 avdg: my sim def needs some -O3
 Bobbadillio: ehh, what's a factor of 2 in speed between friends?
 icecream17: i wonder, what's the fewest possible amount of moves it would take to win if both players output valid actions
 Bobbadillio: Probably a mirror match, but maybe not 
 Bobbadillio: actually, almost definitely not!
 Bobbadillio: Wait, maybe it would be...
 ZarthaxX: TS is not the way to go for sims&#160;:(
 avdg: assemblyscript maybe
 Bobbadillio: I was thinking of highest points/turn for a win, and the loser helping the winner by buying any expensive spells that would otherwise get the bonus.
 icecream17: maybe the opponent would help by learning all the unuseful spells
 JohnCM: fewest number of moves depends on the orders and spells
 avdg: not sure if the js engine supports wasm
 Bobbadillio: ah, okay, so fewer tax ingredients&#160;? that makes sense.
 avdg: but I think it can?
 DreadY2K: The opponent could also get high-tax ingredients to transfer ingredients over
 Bobbadillio: Ohhh, yeah, there you go
 DreadY2K: Small help, but might make a difference @icecream17
 Bobbadillio: That would be cool if the JS engine supports wasm, I should find out. Maybe I can compile my rustbot to wasm and become a javascript competitor :D
 icecream17: i wonder what would happen if the contest was to lose
 icecream17: oh, then no one would do any potions. nvm
 DreadY2K: Yeah, you can just wait so nothing happens
 DreadY2K: Though, if spells are always castable, and resting and waiting are removed, then that might be an  interesting optimization
 DreadY2K: How few points can you get while casting or brewing every round
 avdg: I saw things with 7, maybe 6 points
 gacii: ca
 linjoehan: Do you have to track the number of orders completed?
 avdg: mine doesn't
 avdg: though there is a limit
 avdg: but I think it this way
 avdg: if you brew very fast, you would probably win anyway
 avdg: unless you brew the things that have a low price
 avdg: (except if these were the very easy ones to make)
 linjoehan: you may want to brew fast cheap ones when you in the lead and slow big ones when you are behind
 JohnCM: if the contest was to lose, i'll just rest all the way
 reCurse: Why rest when you can crash
 avdg: so in theory, an ai that is optimized enough shouldn't care about tracking orders
 linjoehan: but it should, you need to know that you can win by ending the game early
 DreadY2K: I wrote code to track the number of orders I've done and not brew a potion if brewing it would make me lose
 DreadY2K: But I haven't seen that code actually be run
 DreadY2K: Either I win easily enough, or the opponent brews the last potion and beats me
 avdg: you just have to know that you are maximizing points with the lowest moves possible
 JohnCM: there's a possible deny strategy
 JohnCM: to trap your opponent with tier 4 ingredients by brewing the tier 4 faster than him
 linjoehan: avdg your opponent has just brewed one putting them 10 points ahead, you can brew that 7 point on your next turn but it will be your 6th one and in doing so you will lose. 
 DreadY2K: @linjoehan fwiw, I wrote code to handle that case, and I've never seen it actually prevent that scenario
 avdg: hmm yeah actually its more complicated indeed
 DreadY2K: It can happen, but it seems to be rare
 avdg: though the start is the same
 avdg: and the only influence is the tome
 avdg: and orders
 Codeab: morning
 Astrobytes: Out for tonight, take care all and see you tomorrow&#160;:)
 Illedan: bye
 avdg: cya
 avdg: and meh, my sim only goes max 5 steps ahead
 struct: cya
 Shparki: What is the best way to debug these things? I can't really log or pint more than one line
 struct: you can print to stderr more than one line
 Shparki: It quits though when I print something it doesn't expect
 struct: what language are you using?
 Shparki: python
 struct: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)
 Shparki: Ah swee thanks, OH stderr, I totally read that but read stdout
 linjoehan: So if you see the first 5 orders and the first 6 spells you can back engineer the random seed and then be the best at look ahead?
 struct: If you have infinite time sure
 struct: and im sure that 2 seeds can have same start position
 struct: and not be equal after it
 miszu: I find one of the c hallenge is to come up with good heuristics. Just checking the difference in inventories doesn't seem enough
 avdg: got my sim up to 3300 moves now
 avdg: I only get 14 steps in the game :p
 miszu: your depth is 14?
 avdg: 5
 avdg: but in game step 14, the computation is too big
 miszu: too many spells you have
 avdg: true
 avdg: though my bot in arena is the non-sim version
 miszu: I am trying to do a non sim version
 miszu: basically take the best step
 miszu: but my heuristics is weak
 avdg: yeah that was the plan
 avdg: the trouble is, sometimes you have to do like 4 good and sometimes unintuitive steps to make progress
 avdg: the trouble is in assembling the required ingredients
 miszu: I am trying to do a heuristics where you compute how much effort would it take instead of differences in inventory and potion
 JohnCM: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505654642">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/505654642</a>
 JohnCM: this is pure luck
 phord: Yargh! All my output has stopped showing in the game info window...
 phord: refresh brought it back.
 avdg: hmm my sim can now handle 5000 moves
 avdg: not enough
 JohnCM: lol i think heuristic only can get to gold
 miszu: gold is good enough for me
 JohnCM: i haven't even optimized my spell use i am now around 600 in silver alr. just purely choosing the right spells at the start gives that much of an edge
 JohnCM: and i am only doing 1-step ahead
 JohnCM: ya this competition to get into legend probably needs insane optimization of the lookahead search process
 meh1001: I've never programmed a bo before this, or read anything about game programming, so I can't even imagine what heuristic would do that well
 meh1001: I did a heuristic thing at first and it cleared wood but didn't do well at all in bronze
 JohnCM: your heuristic must approximate number of turns needed to make the potion well
 meh1001: in fact I had just found this website like a week before the challenge and did 4 or 5 puzzles and then thought what the heck might as well give it a shot
 JohnCM: the more accurate one will be bfs (including repeats)
 JohnCM: it's good to start
 JohnCM: i joined 6 months ago in time for the spring challenge
 JohnCM: i would say the wood league for this challenge is harder, so kudos to you for making it to bronze
 meh1001: I thought a heuristic was when when you approximated
 JohnCM: typically the simpler the challenge, the harder the ai
 miszu: I prefer simple rule but hard AI
 JohnCM: this challenge not as much moving parts as the previous ones
 JohnCM: so it will be very optimization based
 miszu: too much rules and then you are not sure where is wrong in your code
 JohnCM: haha my code is about 150 lines long only for silver
 JohnCM: once i do bfs, it will be about 200-300 lines
 meh1001: yeah I don't know if this one is simple or hard for othe rpeople but it's blowing my mind lol I'm having a great time though
 JohnCM: gd luck
 JohnCM: i'm sure you can make it to silver with a few tweaks
 miszu: my heuristic is like 200 lines of code
 miszu: you and our 150 lines for silver
 miszu: your*
 yhyoxx: what's a good state eval&#160;?
 meh1001: I have BFS at the moment and am at like 380 lines, but 1/3 of that is commented out old stuff snicker
 JohnCM: haha i'm not joking, it's really 150if i remove the comments, maybe only 100 lines
 JohnCM: this is my simplest code ever for silver actually
 ScriptKiddie0101: guys, is there any way to remove these fucking comments in the code?
 JohnCM: pretty glad it worked
 JohnCM: delete them
 ScriptKiddie0101: i dont want to delete it everytime
 JohnCM: isn't it delete once, and it will stay that way forever
 ScriptKiddie0101: how do i delete it?
 JohnCM: on your code screen, just delete the line
 JohnCM: meh1001, are you in gold alr?
 meh1001: nope bronze rofl... but I think I'm about to break into silver
 meh1001: I finally had an epiphany about how I could do the repeats
 JohnCM: all the best
 JohnCM: good state eval is important
 meh1001: I'm 73% in my arena run at #1 so should hit silver
 JohnCM: haha i'm about to code in my repeats now
 JohnCM: haven't coded it yet
 JohnCM: XD
 JohnCM: probably can do hand in hand with bfs
 meh1001: yeah I got em working in tandem
 meh1001: or in the mix anyway
 JohnCM: it's like another action anyway
 JohnCM: action A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F1, F2
 JohnCM: then just bfs it
 JohnCM: what depth is your bfs
 avdg: 5 now
 JohnCM: i wonder if python3 can do depth 5
 avdg: and searching sometimes through 5000 states
 avdg: mine is typescript
 JohnCM: assuming 10 actions per turn, that is 10^5 enumerations
 avdg: pything might be a little bit slower, but not too much
 yhyoxx: i can only do 2depth with cpp
 JohnCM: maybe can monte carlo this one also haha
 JohnCM: have a state eval, do down 3 depth and use monte carlo tree search to choose next action
 miszu: my heuristic has a bug. It doesn't do the move it should. I fixed partially and now it does some children's based potion but it still have a bug
 mikestratton: Anyone on Wood 1 League Fall Challenge?
 meh1001: I'm not sure what ya'll mean by depth in bfs, I think I'm probably not doing it the asme way ya'll are
 JohnCM: you cap the max depth for your bfs
 Rodrigo_the_coder: me
 JohnCM: if not you might be overtime
 meh1001: I think this chat is only people who are in the fall challenge screen
 Rodrigo_the_coder: i in wood 3
 mikestratton: ok
 avdg: my sim solver is now making my sim unhappy about creating too many items in the inventory :p
 mikestratton: Not quite understanding what they are asking for in Wood 1 League
 avdg: making the sim spam few 100 lines about inv overflow
 mikestratton: Trying to figure out if there is a way to display the input of the game in the console
 JohnCM: mike which part is not clear
 JohnCM: i could help
 miszu: yes fixed it finally
 mikestratton: If I could read the input it would help
 meh1001: mike you can just write some code that will debug out all the inputs
 miszu: you can use system err
 meh1001: whilte True: print(input())
 JohnCM: ah...
 meh1001: well, to the stderr
 JohnCM: # print(taskid, file = sys.stderr, flush = True)
 JohnCM: like my taskid is basically the inputs given for the inv0, inv1, etc.
 mikestratton: It won't let you print until its time for my output
 mikestratton: if I do before it just returns error
 JohnCM: what language are you using
 meh1001: Yeah I did that thing I said and then copy/pasted it all into notepad so I could look at it and feed it locally for some debugging, which I didn't do much of because it was kind of irksome
 mikestratton: PHP
 JohnCM: oh can't advice, maybe something to do with the caching
 JohnCM: why not just output something, store all in variables, then print the variables out
 JohnCM: or you can store in strings
 mikestratton: Won't let me
 phord: PHP for this game?  I bow to your courage.
 meh1001: it's kind of hacky, but you can definitely make it read the inputs, write them to stderr, then output WAIT so it moves to the next turn
 mikestratton: ok will try\
 meh1001: I mean obviously if you are literally just scraping input to look at it you don't want to win that round anyway
 miszu: ok so with only looking at current best move + chosing most expensive potions to reach for + not learning new spell I can beat the 999th player in bronze
 miszu: in C++ :sunglasses:
 mikestratton: Ok got the input to display - that helps
 avdg: go get my ai at pos 84&#160;:-)
 avdg: while its still non-sim
 miszu: in bronze?
 miszu: or silver?
 avdg: bronze
 miszu: let me try
 Topjimmies: how do I convert my depth first to breadth first :sweat_smile: driving me nuts
 miszu: yeah you beat mine by at least 20 pts
 miszu: OOOO
 miszu: I beat yours in 1 simulation
 miszu: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/505684248">https://www.codingame.com/replay/505684248</a>
 miszu: = my bot is def better than yours :joy:
 JohnCM: to do bfs, you simply enumerate all the next states first and store the next next states in a buffer.next turn, evaluate the next next states and store the next next next states in a buffer
 avdg: my ai is kinda learn greedy
 JohnCM: dfs is basically whenever you go into the next state, continue from there until end of tree
 miszu: also noticed your AI just want to learn random spells
 miszu: and then yolo
 Topjimmies: learn the whole spellbook, then take the best potions all at once
 JohnCM: before you even finish learning the whole spellbook, a gold-level opponent would have won the game
 JohnCM: seems like if you can't brew 6 potions in 30 turns, you can't go legend
 avdg: hmm I needed 3 more items in inv to win
 JohnCM: that's about 4-5 turns per pot
 Topjimmies: oh shit, gold is already open
 Rodrigo_the_coder: lalalalala.....
 phord: Every time I think I'm done, it pulls me back in.  :crazy:
 Rodrigo_the_coder: Every time I think I'm done, it pulls me back in.  :sob:
 avdg: k solved my counting issue in the sim
 elderlybeginner: are there any changes in in/out between contest's silver and gold league?
 tomatoes: no
 avdg: now my sim gets 6833 moves befoe crash
 avdg: I will plan some optimizations tomorrow
 avdg: to flatten some computation trees
 meh1001: I don't know what that means but it sounds like progress!
 JohnCM: once you hit bronze, it is just about being better than the others already
 avdg: my sim is now basically 1 big dfs
 tomatoes: x4 slower bfs impl gives better result :sweat:
 luthaihoc: Newbie quesion. I 've got top 1 in 1 wood league, How can i prompt to Bronze league&#160;?
 meh1001: it should happen automatically once the arena run completes
 luthaihoc: Thank you
 avdg: my sim is about 600 lines of code inc data structure definitions
 caozouhulue: hello everyone
 NoobCod3: hey
 avdg: so sim this thing isnt too hard
 NoobCod3: anybody wanna be friends?
 caozouhulue: yeah
 caozouhulue: hi noob

 caozouhulue: i like  jazz
 NoobCod3: im listening to slim shady from eminem
 NoobCod3: tell me what song you like
 NoobCod3: i will listen to it
 caozouhulue: i will listen eminem
 NoobCod3: whats your favorite song?
 caozouhulue: i like boney james
 caozouhulue: he's a great saxer
 NoobCod3: im listening
 caozouhulue: i reccomend you his ain't no sunshine
 NoobCod3: dang he is a great saxer
 NoobCod3: wow
 NoobCod3: THAT'S CRAZY!
 caozouhulue: yeah
 NoobCod3: ima listen to the aint no sunshine one
 caozouhulue: he's excellent
 NoobCod3: I like to play guitar and piano
 caozouhulue: oh i found that i have listened the slim shady
 caozouhulue: it' has great beat
 NoobCod3: yea
 caozouhulue: i almost dance with it
 NoobCod3: LEL
 NoobCod3: you should listen to Someone I used to know by Gotye
 NoobCod3: it's a good song
 caozouhulue: what is the mean of LEL
 NoobCod3: LOL i meant
 caozouhulue: ok
 caozouhulue: but we usually call lol as League of LEagends
 NoobCod3: good 
 caozouhulue: i like play league of leagends
 caozouhulue: how do you feel
 NoobCod3: good
 Rodrigo_the_coder: so lonely...
 KrabbyFR: Hey there! how can I replay the same seed please?  
 Topjimmies: god damn python is slow
 Topjimmies: I can only search depth 2, depth 3 times out
 miszu: ok so my naive AI reached 1230/2387 in bronze
 miszu: that's good progress
 miszu: that moment when you beat an opponent by 1 pt. #gg2ez
 Rodrigo_the_coder: # 
 Rodrigo_the_coder: # lol
 Rodrigo_the_coder: #lol
 Rodrigo_the_coder: :disappointed:
 miszu: why sad?
 Rodrigo_the_coder: no one chat
 miszu: i responded to the gg2ez
 miszu: in the ide, is it possible to run vs an ai multiple times and see an average outcome
 Zenoscave: not automatically
 miszu: so I have to press "play my code" 5 times to see 5 outcomes?
 Zenoscave: Or submit  or play offline with a referree engine
 miszu: alright
 meh1001: I looked at the referee thing and then got 100 compile errors because I don't know how to java and figured I'd spend a whole day trying to figure out how to get it working so went back to hitting play
 NinjaDoggy: relatable... except I know java&#160;:(
 meh1001: :laughing:
 LLG: my bot keeps hoarding tier 4 ingredients and get stuck with a full inventory
 LLG: I think evaluating by inventory state is not a good idea lol
 Batpapa: ahah same
 miszu: LLG, your heuristics is too simple so many cases where values are equal
 LLG: yeah I guess
 miszu: had the same problem and need to raise your game man
 LLG: right now I only check for 3 things
 LLG: current score, inventory state and distance to best recipe
 NinjaDoggy: nah evaluate by inventory state is ok
 NinjaDoggy: as long as your search is deep enough&#160;;)
 Rodrigo_the_coder: help
 miszu: inventory state is not enough
 LLG: I guess I need to decrease the weight on inventory state
 miszu: I used a better heuristics
 NinjaDoggy: i eval only by end of game, potion scores, and inventory
 JohnCM: you need to progress towards a potion/potions
 miszu: whatever you are missing, how much time would it take +/- to reach it. Also if you have any extra items, use it to reduce the overall costs
 JohnCM: cannot just by inventory ingredient value
 NinjaDoggy: that's where the deep search comes in
 JohnCM: my heuristic only 1-ply search is now rank 527 in silver:)
 miszu: my gf says my code is not deep enough&#160;:(
 JohnCM: the heuristic is also impt if you don't want to search deep
 LLG: thing is, I haven't really applied any real pruning to my search
 LLG: so I can't go deep
 LLG: atm I just get the local maxima of the current depth and expand from there
 Rodrigo_the_coder: how to go bronze on python
 NinjaDoggy: bronze?
 NinjaDoggy: just pick a potion
 NinjaDoggy: and work towards it
 NinjaDoggy: 1 turn at a time
 NinjaDoggy: find what you're missing
 JohnCM: yea that's my strategy for bronze also
 NinjaDoggy: and try to produce that
 Topjimmies: my code keeps timing out after turn 6
 JohnCM: same as silver too
 Rodrigo_the_coder: tell the code
 miszu: right now my code is not learning new spells. I guess it's time to incorporate that
 NinjaDoggy: honestly
 NinjaDoggy: learning spells is overrated&#160;;)
 NinjaDoggy: I still have 8 turns of hardcoded learning at the start
 NinjaDoggy: and then no more learns after
 miszu: the  bronze bot is mass learning spells and beating me hard
 miszu: I do 0 learning. Learning is for nerds
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 NinjaDoggy: try hard coding X turns of learning at the beginning
 NinjaDoggy: and focusing on cast/brew
 NinjaDoggy: you can get quite far with just that I promise
 miszu: I konw I could do that naive approach
 NinjaDoggy: (currently 41st in gold with it)
 miszu: but I want to have a mechanic where I learn smart spells
 miszu: like -0 + 1
 NinjaDoggy: spells are surprizingly all good
 NinjaDoggy: it's possible to get bad combinations
 NinjaDoggy: but each spell on its own basically has the same value as other spells
 miszu: how a 3 tier0 that gives you 1 tier3 is considered good spell?
 miszu: absolutely barbaric
 Topjimmies: "your code did not read all available input" then timing out after 5-6 turns
 NinjaDoggy: ok yea... that one is  a bit questionable
 NinjaDoggy: if you have a time out
 NinjaDoggy: it will display that error
 miszu: I am confused with the learning spell. I can only learn at index 0?
 NinjaDoggy: basically it goes like this:
 NinjaDoggy: learning a spell costs tier-0 ingredients equal to the index
 NinjaDoggy: so index 0 is free, index 1 costs 1 etc
 NinjaDoggy: and the tier-0 ingredient is then placed onto the spells leading up to it
 NinjaDoggy: and that's the tax
 NinjaDoggy: after you learn a spell, you gain tier-0s equal to the tax
 miszu: sometimes I see like 2-3 tier0 into one square
 miszu: is that normal?

 uhv: wait
 uhv: can anyone explain how im supposed to do these without prior experience with coding&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: codingame assumes that you know the basics already
 uhv: oh i see, no wondering im going nuts here. 
 uhv: any recommendations to learn the "basics"
 slamo: getting "Unknown error (stacktrace too big)" in python, any idea how I can see the error?
 eulerscheZahl: deep recursion
 slamo: i was missing a t -.-
 eulerscheZahl: which resulted in deep recursion?

 YannT: kovi did  you make an algo to timeout people on purpose? :p
 kovi: do i?
 YannT: well it seems to be working on me :p
 Nagatwin: looks like you make me timeout too
 Nagatwin: told you your code was maxing the possible paths ina way or another
 YannT: lays a few mines and then chain silence :D
 YannT: it's not a bad strat actually, seems to work well :p
 kovi: i timeout myself as well
 Nagatwin: yeah Same strat
 Nagatwin: kovi thanks to my dupe checker I get as low as 10% your paths sometimes
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447425902">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447425902</a>
 kovi: i will need that as well, to be able to opt for highest non-duped paths&#160;;)
 pb4: I thought I was immune to timeout kovi
 pb4: You manage to make me timeout, I don't understand how -_-
 Nagatwin: kovi haha
 Nagatwin: Could be an idea to make a simu that maxs out the possibilities
 Nagatwin: how to crush legend
 eulerscheZahl: that's something for a last minute submit
 Zandy156: I thought most of the top bots would be immune to timeout from that by now, but several of them aren't. 
 ThomasNicoullaud: eulerscheZahl if you push all the day, you ll made me the first :D
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry, not my intention
 eulerscheZahl: when did you become a mod? :o
 ThomasNicoullaud: 2 months i think
 ThomasNicoullaud: :nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: you should be more active in the english chat for me to notice
 eulerscheZahl: damn, submit started will. i was close to getting optimistic&#160;:(
 ThomasNicoullaud: i never write here
 ThomasNicoullaud: my poor english, shame on me
 ThomasNicoullaud: go #fr&#160;;)
 Nagatwin: This one is a bad version eulerscheZahl it achieves 50% wins against me
 Nagatwin: :cold_sweat:
 eulerscheZahl: my French is much worse than your English

 eulerscheZahl: no need for excuses SeebOmega
 eulerscheZahl: spammer was here, gone nowthat's all that matters
 navin89098909890: COrona
 chucknorris: silence meta is back kovi&#160;? :P 
 kovi: actually it was not on purpose
 Nagatwin: These chain submits really screw up the ladder
 Nagatwin: wlesavo / eulerscheZahl submit&#160;: I get +3 rank
 Nagatwin: kovi / chucknorris submit&#160;: I loose 3 ranks
 Nagatwin: only dbdr seems neutral
 Nagatwin: I can tell who submitted the most based on my rank at a given time of the day
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: nice strategy: "he won't find me when i'm on an island" <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447428330">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447428330</a>
 Nagatwin: There's fairly enough space to go between those two anyway
 wlesavo: wow, this is some actual piece of tactics <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447450104">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447450104</a>
 wlesavo: keeping a mine for close fights seems to be a good idea
 Nagatwin: clean
 Nagatwin: is he doing that all the games&#160;?
 wlesavo: not exactly that
 wlesavo: but he keeps a mine just in case
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447451297">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447451297</a>
 wlesavo: without actual spaming
 Nagatwin: he places mines directly in front of others
 wlesavo: well it is effective in these close fights, especialy if you have better finisher, my finisher can produce some draws, but i guess its better then loses
 Nagatwin: Yeah
 Nagatwin: Can you trigger a mine you just placed&#160;?
 chucknorris: nope
 Nagatwin: nvm
 Nagatwin: yes just saw that
 Nagatwin: that's kind of sad
 chucknorris: I'd increase the branching factor by a lot so I'm okay with that 
 wlesavo: still effective, just a little harder to manage
 SilverBlade: yo
 wlesavo: chucknorris agreed
 Nerchio: My last 20 battles in the match history is against the same guy
 Nerchio: why is it so?
 wlesavo: he just submits a  lot
 chucknorris: spam submitters :rage:
 eulerscheZahl: because that guy spam-submitted
 YannT: stop timing me out kovi :p
 wlesavo: fix it
 pb4: He uses so much silences -_-
 chucknorris: I timeout like every time
 chucknorris: time to fix the part that I didn't want to touch anymore
 AntiSquid: replays for the current submit disappear very fast
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: nice catch on Valgrowth's thing
 ThomasNicoullaud: the winner ll be the one who pushes in the last second the silence chained strategy, and will timeout all the board&#160;:)
 Nerchio: it's nice to see you guys timeout as well sometimes :D
 Nerchio: it's not only a silver problem
 chucknorris: I thought I no longer need the pruning code in gold so I gently removed it :p 
 Nerchio: so that makes spam silence one of the strongest strategies? 
 wlesavo: not really
 wlesavo: unless you have much to support it
 pb4: Nerchio&#160;: spam silence isn't the be-all-end-all no
 pb4: at least not for me
 Mattwei: test test
 Piemert: I want to tweak my parameters by machine learning. Can I get the code somewhere to use it as an API for playing games against myself?
 eulerscheZahl: you should play against yourself offline instead
 eulerscheZahl: it's faster and less stress for the CG servers
 eulerscheZahl: there's a link to the source in the statement (expert rules section)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code">https://github.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code</a>
 Piemert: tnx
 wlesavo: may i ask you guys to warn me to stop clicking submit button an hour or two before promotion happens
 Illedan: Did you try to use benchmark instead of spamming? :P 
 wlesavo: nop :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: is there a good guide on benchmarking?
 eulerscheZahl: how many submits are there in your history?
 wlesavo: around 400
 Illedan: wow
 eulerscheZahl: and i felt bad for my 130
 dbdr: 158
 Illedan: 160 :O
 kovi: chuck has 1000
 Illedan: Too many the first weekend
 wlesavo: this is only half of chucks
 chucknorris: no kovi I only have 965
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i have 131submitted the java default AI once because i was curious
 dbdr: I have 2 JS ones&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: dummy opponent to test against?
 wlesavo: but i cut most of submits early
 dbdr: no, sub in the first minutes
 dbdr: but still after the broken bot
 eulerscheZahl: broken boss promotion
 dbdr: nope
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 dbdr: actually I think it might have been good I missed it
 dbdr: forced me to work on tracking since wood 2&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: did you know that CG has no versioning system for our submits? they save every code as a new one. no diffs
 dbdr: not surprised
 dbdr: if I was them I would at least handle identical code
 dbdr: to handle spammers
 Nagatwin: I guess checking for identical code would be the same as versionning
 dbdr: easier
 dbdr: just a checksum
 eulerscheZahl: with your knowledge from today, yesCG started as a puzzle site, not even multiplayers
 wlesavo: dbdr same, had most of the tracking ready in wood 2
 dbdr: sure. but that could be added to the system
 dbdr: I know it's still work
 dbdr: kovi how many submits?&#160;;)
 kovi: 512
 dbdr: nice round number
 wlesavo: wow
 dbdr: someone said 1k for chuck?
 chucknorris: 965
 dbdr: I see more subs from kovi. might depend on the schedule
 eulerscheZahl: xkcd.com/1000typed that link out of my head

 dbdr: but also nice
 eulerscheZahl: i need that book too
 eulerscheZahl: made a small biking trip yesterday, as working from home makes me sit all day
 dbdr: yeah, needed. this morning I found out they closed one access to the lake nearby, not sure yet why
 JackJohnson: Hi,  i wasn't on codingame for a while, but i remember that i could configurate my Console output to be side by side to the Viewer. Anyone know how it could be done?
 eulerscheZahl: CG Enhancer?
 eulerscheZahl: in case you missed it: we have a contest running&#160;;)
 JackJohnson: Yeah, i'm in it&#160;:) Wood 1
 eulerscheZahl: interesting biography text. what's your current profile completion state?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm at 80% and it tells me to rate my company
 Q12: what contest?
 eulerscheZahl: ocean of code
 Q12: ahh
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl if you do not specify a company I beleive you are at 100% :p
 Nagatwin: the 80% showed up when I selected a company
 eulerscheZahl: my company isn't even correct anymore
 eulerscheZahl: updated
 JackJohnson: couldn't remember what i typed in bio, just looked it up again&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: ahah
 Nagatwin: Energy
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, our CEO got crazy
 eulerscheZahl: opted for a carve-out
 AntiSquid: about the "rate your company", where do you see what you wrote previously&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: who is the rating for anyway
 eulerscheZahl: "These reviews will be published anonymously and will give you an idea of where developers love to code!"
 AntiSquid: published where?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess same as for their annual surveys
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't know
 AntiSquid: i guess it's like glassdoor but with CG it's easier to narrow down the possible reviewers
 Nagatwin: I'll make a "kovi special" AI I guess
 pb4: "yeah, our CEO got crazyopted for a carve-out"
 pb4: Curious as to what that means&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: Siemens is a huge company with &gt;300k employeesso he decided to split it into pieces
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl still well placed for gold boss
 eulerscheZahl: initially planned to sell our division to Mitsubishi
 eulerscheZahl: but rest of those in response voted against, so we founded a new company instead
 eulerscheZahl: with &gt;80k employees
 eulerscheZahl: still not finished
 eulerscheZahl: planned to go on the stock market in september
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't want to be the gold boss darkhorse64 :scream:
 kovi: these are hard times, even in it
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, players get stronger
 kovi: IT (or at least some part of it)
 kovi: i meant RL
 eulerscheZahl: oh, not talking about the contest
 Piemert: anyway to set the seed and timeout locally?
 eulerscheZahl: seed: yes
 eulerscheZahl: timeout: no
 Illedan: Can't you hack that with reflection?
 Nagatwin: having 5200 paths stored in an array of 5000 paths
 Nagatwin: what could go wrong&#160;?
 darkhorse64: What's the problem&#160;? The gold bot moves to legend no&#160;?
 pb4: 200 paths
 Nagatwin: pb4 haha
 Nagatwin: That's what happens every game against kovi
 Nagatwin: but the bot manages to stay alive 20 turns after that
 Nagatwin: im quite impressed
 pb4: darkhorse64&#160;: everyone will optimize against the boss
 pb4: so everyone entering gold league will have a strong bot against the person chosen to be the boss
 pb4: hence that person will be pulled down in legend&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: They should not take a boss that times out against silence spammers
 Illedan: true
 Nagatwin: otherwise this will be the same as the gold league opening
 Illedan: I'll try to tweak this a little and maybe become the boss
 Nagatwin: doesn't 28 sound low for a legend boss&#160;?
 dbdr: hence the tweaking
 Nagatwin: Oh
 Illedan: :P
 dbdr: I assumpe tweak up, not down&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: I understood tweaking as "avoiding timeouts"
 Illedan: My bot just resets above 1000 paths
 Illedan: no problem
 wlesavo: spam silence boss  :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: make the spam silence great again
 darkhorse64: Reset is risky. I have tried to stop silencing when my #paths becomes too large (not to lose tracking accuracy) but it was bad
 AntiSquid: today is legend opening
 darkhorse64: today is the day of deception
 AntiSquid: after 3 PM expect massive submit spams, everyone panic submitting hours before it opens like it's their last chance to improve their bot
 AntiSquid: or maybe earlier
 Illedan: That will start after legend opens
 AntiSquid: it starts even before legend
 AntiSquid: hours before
 Illedan: kovi timeout often?
 kovi: not really. i will look into that
 kovi: you are not deterministic?
 Illedan: I'm deterministic yeah
 Illedan: as long as you are too
 kovi: wierd first replay was different
 kovi: now its ok
 Illedan: Wonder if I can crash players by placing multiple mines from the same location and then start triggering :D
 kovi: not crash. but screw detection
 dbdr: that's long term planning :D
 wlesavo: i think many would handle it well
 dbdr: it takes sophistication to fail on that :D
 Illedan: I have a throw if I can't see the enemy anymore. Just to crash on bugs
 Illedan: others might too
 wlesavo: well it is a good strategy for a boss for sure
 dbdr: I have that too
 wlesavo: same
 kovi: i dont
 Illedan: :evil:
 dbdr: might be good for the boss not to crash in that case though
 wlesavo: well i just divide by count
 dbdr: opens a vulnerability
 Illedan: my code wont
 dbdr: didn't you just say you do?
 dbdr: you'll change it?
 Illedan: oh yeah that. But I'm would not crash on multiple mines
 dbdr: I meant crash on anything
 Illedan: But I can't see what should crash it
 dbdr: famous last words&#160;:)
 Illedan: pffx
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan working in the hope of becoming the boss?
 Illedan: Sure
 Illedan: if(time &gt; 20PM ) EnableMinMax = true;
 Illedan: ^^
 eulerscheZahl: PM?
 Illedan: 8*
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: you get it
 wlesavo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: ah, pm, post meridiem
 eulerscheZahl: the uppercase confused me, not even trolling
 Illedan: aiit, mybad
 eulerscheZahl: thought we were counting frames per game or something like that
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447500821">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447500821</a>euler, what is the logic behind your end game? All those surfaces? Afraid of mines?
 eulerscheZahl: i remember using such a kill switch for the BotG recalc
 dbdr: carpe legenda diem
 kovi: euler surface: i still do the same 
 eulerscheZahl: my surface still triggers way too often
 eulerscheZahl: yes, scared of mines
 eulerscheZahl: on average 1.32 surface per game
 dbdr: and your trigger surfaces?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: i should clean that stat to remove kill turns from it
 eulerscheZahl: as it doesn't matter if i SURFACE|TORPEDO &lt;kill location&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: and i want a pie chart for charges used :D
 Illedan: You want me to add it to the viewer?: P
 eulerscheZahl: also dbdr wrong casus for the adjective"carpe legenda diem"
 wlesavo: i actually fixed some charge problems, dunno if it helped though
 eulerscheZahl: no Illedanfor my internal stats which i do across multiple matches
 dbdr: what's the correct way?
 Illedan: aha
 dbdr: I lke latin words but can't conjugate
 eulerscheZahl: "legendam" would be closerbut a particip from legere, nothing legendary
 eulerscheZahl: it's even declinate unless you talk about verbs
 dbdr: right
 dbdr: I'm wrong about the way in which I'm wrong :D
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, got tortured for too long to be able to ignore it now :D
 dbdr: "5 which is to be read (aloud), recited."
 dbdr: I knew that's where legendary comes from. something worth reading about
 codingWhale: Quite intense: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447511730">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447511730</a>
 Q12: well done
 eulerscheZahl: TODO find better spawn point
 codingWhale: You don't think random is good enough?&#160;;) At least, there was a fight! :P
 DEIZ21: hey submarines what's up
 DEIZ21: i have a question plz regarding self tracking
 DEIZ21: what is the moment you compute it at the begining of the turn or at the end just before sending the command to the referee?
 eulerscheZahl: you can answer that yourself: what state does your opponent get as input?
 DEIZ21: yeh sure this is exactly my problem
 DEIZ21: i implemented it and figured out that i done it incorrectly
 DEIZ21: but to make use of the same data than the opponent i luck of the data sent by the referee to the opponnent (new life new opp life...)
 eulerscheZahl: so you know the answer: you have to eval the board state after applying your own actions
 DEIZ21: i already thought about this off course
 DEIZ21: the problem is that in my tracking function i make use of the data indicating if the opponent was damaged or not, this data could only be given by the referee
 eulerscheZahl: then you have to wait till the next turn to complete self-tracking
 WINWINWIN: when does legend open in ocean of code?
 Illedan: In about 4-5 hours
 DEIZ21: this is exactly what i'm doing now but as i already said the computation ll be done on other data than what the opponent is doing his computation
 WINWINWIN: thanks illedan
 DEIZ21: illedan i have a question plz
 Illedan: sure?
 DEIZ21: do you take into account the damage u take when tracking the opponent?
 Illedan: no need?
 inoryy: huh, two polish universities in top10
 DEIZ21: ok cause i made some heuristics based on concidering the opponent smart enough to not damage him self if he doesnt touch me
 inoryy: not to mention Wroclaw holding #1
 aCat:&#160;;-)
 DEIZ21: but than i cant use the same method to self tracking
 aCat: I have no idea how this happened
 inoryy: haha
 aCat: this cat is innocent
 Illedan: xD
 wlesavo: DEIZ21 that is not necessarily true
 eulerscheZahl: my university doesn't even exist on that leaderboard&#160;:(
 inoryy: same&#160;:/
 aCat: make fake accounts and win the university leaderboard all by yourself euller ^^
 Illedan: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: you gave an idea for Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan how is your colleague doing so far?
 DEIZ21: thx wlesavo, i just tryed to take into account the force of the opponenet, if he isnt sure to damage me he wont damage him self, in the case where i fire and opp fire if ididnt take damge i supose my firing did all the damage to the opponent
 DEIZ21: in case he lost 2 life i cut all the paths right away
 Illedan: Looks like this game was too big of an onboarding to the platform..&#160;:( But we will see..
 wlesavo: DEIZ21 there is a better way do do this without any assumptions, you can just count all the damage from all sources, and then cut based on that
 DEIZ21: yes but think of it if you guess what the exact source ang it happens you are right u cut much more paths
 DEIZ21: off course you taking the risk of false assumptin but this is the deal :p
 wlesavo: well for sure i cant cut based on that, only weight
 DEIZ21: i m pretty shure it woul be right at 99%
 DEIZ21: in your eval do you allow to damage your self without being sure to atleast dealing damage to the oppenent
 DEIZ21: i guess the answer ll be no
 DEIZ21: me too
 DEIZ21: all top players too
 DEIZ21: so i wanted to exploit this in my favor
 DEIZ21: if i m not damaged i concider all the damage the opponent got comming from my fire
 wlesavo: that shouldnt give much in terms of cutting anyway, basically you trade like 2-3% for 1% loosing track 
 DEIZ21: any way i ll get rid of this
 wlesavo: but you can weight them to be like 0.01 of normal candidates i guess
 DEIZ21: because cant use the same function for self tracking
 DEIZ21: cause i dont have the data sent by the referee
 wlesavo: but weighting didnt work for me in general, only for countering silence 0 for a while
 DEIZ21: ah
 DEIZ21: i dont use weights
 wlesavo: i also thought that i could be able to predict spawning points, failed misserably
 DEIZ21: what spawning mean
 pb4: if(pb4) spawningpoint = 5,7
 pb4: You're welcome 
 pb4:&#160;:)
 Illedan: :D
 DEIZ21: :D
 pb4: (for real, check the replays)
 Nagatwin: why&#160;? :o
 pb4: random with fixed seed will do that for you
 Nagatwin: Oh
 DEIZ21: i fail miserably in the confrontation  as i dont simulate and my bot doesnt knwo how to deal
 Nagatwin: I found a bug then
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447521676">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447521676</a>
 Nagatwin: you did not start at the right position :p
 pb4: damn, I should start on land&#160;!
 Nagatwin: Yeah
 Nagatwin: let's play with tanks and not submarines
 Nagatwin: sink them from the land
 Illedan: I can swap the sub with a tank on land?
 Nagatwin: kovi pushed you so damn high
 DEIZ21: sure illedan but this  is an other contest :D
 Zandy156: It'd be really impressive if you did start on 5,7 even when it's land and were still #1.
 Nagatwin: 36
 Nagatwin: now 35.7
 DEIZ21: a last question plz cause i need help;
 DEIZ21: do you guys make use of opp life lost in the tracking?
 DEIZ21: i guess the answer is off course yes
 Nagatwin: yes to see if he got touched by a mine/torpedo
 RockyMullet: goooooold baby
 RockyMullet: just in time for gold to irrelevant :P
 Uljahn: woah goldmullet gratz
 RockyMullet: ty ty
 RockyMullet: was stuck around 10th, added something in my torpedo code to allow dealing one damage to myself if it meant dealing 2 to the enemy and killing it
 RockyMullet: seemed to be enough :D
 Uljahn: shouldn't you do it based on a remaining hp? like when it's even for opp
 Nerchio: gz rockyMulet :P i am around top10 silver
 Uljahn: ahh, killing means finnishin move
 RockyMullet: might be, the reason I didnt do it all the time is because the enemy can always shoot back and then deal 2 damage so I'd lose 3 in the head while he lose 2
 RockyMullet: Nerchio I pushed the boss down a bit, it might help :P
 RockyMullet: Uljahn yeah, the finishing move
 AntiSquid: there's a storm on the gold ocean
 RockyMullet: my mullet has a taste of the gold ocean's wind
 RockyMullet: in a couple of hours all be back at peasant level
 RockyMullet: when legend's out
 Nerchio: legend is not out?
 AntiSquid: 3 hours 15 minutes?
 RockyMullet: did they annonce it&#160;?
 AntiSquid: oh everyone should start panic submit any moment now
 RockyMullet: I just assume its somewhere around noon to 1pm my time, aka 2 or 3hs from now
 AntiSquid: RockyMullet click on rank in the IDE
 AntiSquid: it shows date
 RockyMullet: yeah, today
 AntiSquid: quite sure it's 3 hours from now RockyMullet, maybe i am overlooking some daylight saving change ...
 RockyMullet: oooooh, maybe thats it
 RockyMullet: yeah we are back at "summer time" now, even do it snowed yesterday...
 RockyMullet: stabilized 191/243 in gold
 RockyMullet: Nerchio your bot is probably better than a bunch in gold haha
 BitMan: Hello Everyone!can someone please tell me of the upcoming challenge.How much of Python knowledge will be required to get participate in it
 RockyMullet: BitMan there is an ongoing contest right now
 RockyMullet: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>
 AntiSquid: to participate not much
 SuperYoyo92: Hello
 BitMan: No, i AM saying of the one name codingame summer challenge that's going to start on 7th may
 RockyMullet: yeah if you can read the input and ouput something (which is usually already done in the default code) you can manage to do something
 RockyMullet: BitMan we dont know what it is yet, but it likely similar in difficulty to the others
 RockyMullet: I'd say either try your hand on the current contest or try the "bot programming" in the "compete" tab which are old contest challenges
 RockyMullet: should give you an idea of how ready you are
 dbdr: Illedan what rank are you aiming for?
 Illedan: 1st +- 1
 dbdr: gogogo 0th
 dbdr: watch out for wrap arounds
 dbdr: 65535th
 Illedan: So, try to run away from enemy or try to run towards :thinking:
 pb4: depends whether you're confident in your close-quarter combat :D
 Illedan: My spagetti was born ready
 blasterpoard: isn't running away almost always more solid?
 Illedan: Not if you have less hp and less claimed territory..
 blasterpoard: well, but claiming territory is something you can be more consistently good at than fighting
 BitMan: RockyMullet Thanks, I will try the ones you suggest.&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: gl&#160;:)
 Illedan: hmm
 blasterpoard: opponent just silences the turn before your torpedo is ready, and well, I guess it's 50/50 now
 Illedan: Let's see how running away does
 mrdude: who we can detect land
 eulerscheZahl: x in the input of the first turn
 eulerscheZahl: . for water
 Nagatwin: hahaaaaaa
 Nagatwin: last push got rid of this git issue
 Nagatwin: "survive kovi"
 eulerscheZahl: still below the toad :P
 Illedan: lucky 12th toad?
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i don't have a toad anymore
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447555936">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447555936</a>still playing stupid with mines, frame 37
 pb4: how is that stupid euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i trap myself
 eulerscheZahl: at some point i should just risk the mines i think
 eulerscheZahl: and my danger map tells me that the mines can be almost anywhere
 pb4: oh right didn't see that
 pb4: I was just looking at where you put your mine :D
 RockyMullet: is a danger map that useful for mines&#160;? I feel it would be most of the time "there are mines everywhere"
 Illedan: Far easier to track that I expected
 RockyMullet: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: just hard to find the balance between safe and paranoid
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm slowly getting lost in spaghetti
 RockyMullet: add some sauce
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: suggest a taste so i can say no
 RockyMullet: a fish sauce
 RockyMullet: adding something stinky over your spagetthi
 darkhorse64: toad slime
 RockyMullet: genious
 Astrobytes: Spaghetti alla puttanesca
 Schinkey: how do I output stuff to console without it registering as a solution?
 ZarthaxX: fish sauce is a thing carne?
 Astrobytes: puttanesca has anchovies
 RockyMullet: I guess you are not used to asian food carne
 darkhorse64: push play not submit
 eulerscheZahl: and that's where you lost me Astrobytes, not gonna eat that
 Astrobytes: Neither would I eulerscheZahl, though I used to in the past
 eulerscheZahl: i know, you are vegetarian now&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: fish sauce smells disgusting yet, makes food delicious
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 RockyMullet: so yeah, eulerscheZahl, makes disgusting code to make your bot delicious
 AntiSquid: i don't find fish sauce smell disgusting @_@
 AntiSquid: i bet the alternative to fish soy sauce is some kind of soy sauce with flavoring and bunch of chemicals you need a PhD in Chemistry to know what you're really eating
 AntiSquid: fish sauce *

 Illedan: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 blasterpoard: thanks I guess
 Nerchio: advanced to gold what :D
 AntiSquid: too close for comfort
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo you asked us to remind you: stop submitting soon
 wlesavo: stoped a while ago but thx anyway euler, appreciate
 Nagatwin: illedan lol
 Nagatwin: Draw is better than loose I guess&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: but easy to fix
 Nagatwin: you could have missed
 blasterpoard: ... I found it very funny that my bot that can't fight at all went from rank 10 to rank 20 just by changing the strategy for first 30 moves
 blasterpoard: *from 20 to 10
 kovi: but is a stable rank10?
 blasterpoard: looks like it
 blasterpoard: my winrate depends very little on who am I playing against
 AntiSquid: submit 20 times to know for sure
 blasterpoard: it's mostly random depending on how badly does it di in fights
 kovi: no need to resubmit. we will see an 2 hours
 blasterpoard: *it does
 blasterpoard: anyway, the point of this submit was just to make sure I'll get to legend
 AntiSquid: nice spot to become the gold boss euler
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to be the boss
 eulerscheZahl: that just encourages players to exploit the weaknesses of my bot
 Nagatwin: Everytime I deviate from my original strategy I loose 10 ranks or so&#160;:/
 AviLevi: why all programmers using macbook?
 AntiSquid: ban
 aCat: oh, still no legend bot?
 eulerscheZahl: should be in 30min
 eulerscheZahl: with an epic name
 blasterpoard: are the bosses still catpains instead of captains, or was that fixed long ago?
 eulerscheZahl: fixed
 Nagatwin:&#160;:'(
 eulerscheZahl: blame Saiksy
 Nagatwin: Catpain was nice
 eulerscheZahl: are you a dogs person?
 Nagatwin: the fun misspell
 Nagatwin: haha
 Nagatwin: Im alergic to cats :p
 aCat:&#160;:&gt;
 AntiSquid: they should be catnips instead
 blasterpoard: I guess you're free to interpret Ctp. however you want to
 aCat: Cpt.&#160;??? :P
 tobk: might be a bit late to ask, but is anyone using SONAR to any success? seems like a waste of moves to me
 eulerscheZahl: i even have piecharts to answer that question
 Nagatwin: :D
 eulerscheZahl: some in the top10 use it, some ignore it completely
 Nagatwin: Its my next-level kovi counter
 Nagatwin: but shuush
 eulerscheZahl: kovi uses by far the most silence in the top ranks
 eulerscheZahl: friendly reminder: stop submitting if you hope to pass to legend
 blasterpoard: tfw legend opens in less than an hour and we still don't have a meta xD
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl I wanna drag you down so you're the boss :p
 Nagatwin: #17 would be perfect
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to be the boss nor being drowned
 dbdr: Illedan confirmed as the boss?
 eulerscheZahl: #16 there we go
 Nagatwin: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i have no idea who it will be
 eulerscheZahl: but i know the name
 dbdr: how many letters?
 Nagatwin: Ctp Whale
 eulerscheZahl: 7
 dbdr: _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr suggested the name
 dbdr: yes?&#160;:)
 dbdr: \o/
 tobk: I hope it's not Sparrow... maybe Ramius?
 blasterpoard: cpt obvious?
 blasterpoard: if I'm right, I should be the boss, because I'm not even trying to hide
 Neozero: Hello can someone help me&#160;? I'm stuck at the TAN Network Puzzle.
 IjustKilledutoo: :heart_eyes:
 Neozero: "5 stops, 2 routes" Don't seems to work.
 Neozero: For me
 Neozero: Everything else is working fine.
 Neozero:&#160;:(
 EricSMSO: 7 letters&#160;? k....19&#160;?
 EricSMSO: *c....19
 Astrobytes: Captain Pugwash
 dbdr: :zipper_mouth:
 YannT: it's gonna be Captain Sparrow I bet
 eulerscheZahl: we have sparrow at CotC already
 tobk: Also he does not have a submarine... at least not intentionally.
 Astrobytes: Captain Perière
 eulerscheZahl: Nagatwin stop submitting
 eulerscheZahl: you are pushing me down&#160;:/
 kovi: siman top
 dbdr: Nagatwin you'll miss the promotion too
 dbdr: top 4 is random?
 kovi: no
 dbdr: pb4 was top most of the time recently, no?
 kovi: top3 is,i'm weaker - jolienden is better than me
 dbdr: now #4
 kovi: joliended and pb4
 YannT: same kovi, I'm slowly falling at this point
 YannT: and I'm kinda out of ideas to keep up now&#160;:(
 YannT: jolindien siman and pb4 are clearly above the lot now
 kovi: yeah, even though im currently near 2nd
 kovi: i still have 2 pages of todos
 YannT: lucky you, I have like one impactful idea, and maybe 3 minor ones that probably won't do anything
 AntiSquid: 2 pages?
 kovi: but probably will look into their strat as well
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl that's true love &lt;3
 eulerscheZahl: what?
 Nagatwin: dbdr I don't mind missing the promotion 
 Nagatwin: "Nagatwin stop submittingyou are pushing me down&#160;:/"
 eulerscheZahl: seems that they are opting for a hard boss. i probably have to improve&#160;:(
 kovi: time?
 Nagatwin: how hard&#160;? :o
 eulerscheZahl: soon
 AntiSquid: how do you know they want a hard boss?
 eulerscheZahl: discord
 eulerscheZahl: (not the public one)
 aCat: nooo&#160;:(
 kovi: nagatwin done
 aCat: I was wishing for a legend just one time I like the game and finally do some serious ccoding
 YannT: they were looking at dbdr's code so that's #12&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: kovi yeah I pushed a bad version
 AntiSquid: oh well contest is hard already, but overall don't mind either way since top 30 is hard anyway
 YannT: also dbdr apparently has bad code
 eulerscheZahl: how do you know? #fr?
 inoryy: haha
 AntiSquid: tell him to fix it Yaroslav3991
 YannT: yeah euler
 AntiSquid: YannT
 eulerscheZahl: does dbdr timeout in the IDE?
 RoboStac: oh god, imagine a rust boss that no one could test against
 eulerscheZahl: i rarely play matches there
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl yes&#160;:(
 kovi: robo, yeah
 Zac__likes_fortnite: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 eulerscheZahl: no boss for you then
 Zac__likes_fortnite: Good Morning
 dbdr: I learned recently that's a good thing
 Zac__likes_fortnite: Hello
 Zac__likes_fortnite: hello
 Zac__likes_fortnite: hello
 AntiSquid: Zac stop
 Zac__likes_fortnite: hello
 Zac__likes_fortnite: Good morning
 eulerscheZahl: almost noone submitting, that's something rare
 YannT: I passed legend suddenly am I alone? :o
 eulerscheZahl: the boss!
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it coming&#160;:(
 YannT: aouch
 eulerscheZahl: since when does the boss have no rank in the IDE leaderboard?
 wlesavo: lol
 aCat: Idk, but it doesn't have now
 eulerscheZahl: first time i see it
 aCat: I was seatching for the boss on leaderboard for a few days ;p
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl this is how last time promoting crashed
 AntiSquid: so who is the boss?
 eulerscheZahl: no, by setting the boss score manually to that of a player
 eulerscheZahl: while said player decided to submit at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: so the boss had a score of 0
 AntiSquid: nvm
 wlesavo: so im the boss? it does print fatality but does not print other stuff, and my seed was random
 AntiSquid: yes
 wlesavo: i think seed was commented out in submit
 eulerscheZahl: they tend to make bots deterministic
 aCat: top 10 legend...
 YannT: maybe they removed some of your messages to not help people&#160;;)
 aCat: thats harsh
 wlesavo: they could just uncomment that
 AntiSquid: there's a full week
 eulerscheZahl: a week of pain and suffering
 wlesavo: YannT silver boss was printing
 aCat: you assume the function of better bot is always ascending
 AntiSquid: so now does submit spam help in legend? :p
 YannT: well at this end of this rerun we'll have a clear picture of the rankings at least
 YannT: (I'm not gonna come out of this very well)
 kovi: 0-9 vs. jolindien
 YannT: well that's a horrible rerun
 inoryy: 1.5pt between boss and #2, wow
 kovi: there was a gap there
 Illedan: Damn, gonna be hard
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: hmm, 1 point above me. Anyone want to push? :P
 inoryy: you mean push the boss up?
 blasterpoard: Illedan I'll give it a go
 Illedan: nonono
 AntiSquid: wow looks like a lot of improvement is required
 NormantasStankevicius: I enjoy, how half of the participants are in wood
 NormantasStankevicius: well not really enjoy
 NormantasStankevicius: more fascinated
 NormantasStankevicius: Wood1 right now has 590
 YannT: doesn't surprise me, the barrier to entry on this contest is higher than usual
 NormantasStankevicius: might be
 NormantasStankevicius: Not really experienced with these competitions
 AntiSquid: alternative would be a huge bronze/silver league
 NormantasStankevicius: Coders of the galaxy IMO were harder
 inoryy: and that's after the W1 boss was nerfed twice
 aCat: yep - reminds me of cobu - neede some pathfinding, go there, go back
 AntiSquid: i passed wood boss before nerf i believe :thinking:
 YannT: me too, and I had to write a BFS and basic detection already
 YannT: so, not trivial
 NormantasStankevicius: BFS?
 YannT: breadth first search
 AntiSquid: wood 1 was trivial though! just add silence 
 Valdemar: BruteForseSequentialkill
 YannT: I went straight to bronze :D
 NormantasStankevicius: Hmmm,  I'm coding in C#, is there enought computing power, to think that my opponent is anywhere on the grid?
 inoryy: I needed planning, basic torpedo avoidance and enemy detection to get through
 AntiSquid: nice brickwall you wrote wlesavo
 NormantasStankevicius: aka, take the 15x15grid, and think he might be anywhere, and remove where he could not be
 NormantasStankevicius: every turn
 Valdemar: NormantasStankevicius depends on algo, there is python3 bot in top10
 inoryy: that's what everybody does from bronze and up
 YannT: I'm top10 with a JVM language
 NormantasStankevicius: Thanks Valdemar, that means it should be plausible 
 wlesavo: AntiSquid lol
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl also waiting for a push?
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 RoboStac: I appear to be giving him one
 eulerscheZahl: indeed
 dbdr: not sure it will work, but worth waiting a bit
 FlamingRobot_e54f: Guys im new here and excited to be here
 eulerscheZahl: right now i like robo much more than eric and erik
 AntiSquid: FlamingRobot_e54f i got exciting news for you then! there's a contest going on and you can join&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>
 EricSMSO: Oups, I am pushing up the Boss 
 eulerscheZahl: you weren't supposed to do that
 FlamingRobot_e54f: thanks @antiSquid
 duckquackduck: For ocean of code,c an you MOVE E| SILENCE E 4 - in the same command? What will be the result? Will you got 1 cell or 4 cells east? 
 RoboStac: 5
 RoboStac: and yes, you can
 duckquackduck: :astonished:
 duckquackduck: thanks @RoboStac
 eulerscheZahl: the boss already gained more than 1 points since legend opened
 rwilson:&#160;;) Wouldn't it be hilarious if someone had their bot set to turn on new strategies as the DATE changed&#160;;)    what would happen if that got picked as a boss&#160;;) 
 icecream17: wait, legend opened?
 rwilson: legend is top 10 at the moment 
 AntiSquid: not enough space to write that much rwilson
 eulerscheZahl: they read the boss code before deciding
 rwilson: AntiSquid did it toss my message in a pastebin due to smiley's
 wlesavo: to bad they didnot uncomment setting the seed
 wlesavo: didnt expected to be the boss, otherwise would do it myself for sure
 rwilson: even something like  if( day = Tuesday) { runSilentSpam }   would be 'fun'
 tobk: aw, gold boss uses random with random seed... so much for reproducible playouts&#160;:-(
 wlesavo: tobk sorry for that :no_mouth:
 icecream17: nice. i improved to 176th overnight
 eulerscheZahl: why do you even want randomness in your bot wlesavo?
 eulerscheZahl: deterministic makes it much easier for you to debug your code
 tobk: I guess random is useful for some tiebreaks, but I usually use a fixed seed so I can check if a "should no nothing" refactoring actually really did nothing
 mlomb: maybe to avoid other to debug losses vs him
 mlomb: others*
 AntiSquid: rwilson no pastebin showed up for me so don't know
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl have path finding with random, and i just commented it for a couple of subs and has forgotten 
 AntiSquid: isn't random better in arena?
 AntiSquid: random with the currently used seed in the message :D
 dbdr: LeChuck is not deterministic?
 Valdemar: dbdr yes, blame wlesavo for that
 dbdr: no blame
 wlesavo: well to be honest fixed seed would not be enough for it to be deterministic
 wlesavo: i also have search interruption at fixed time, and that depends on more than just a seed
 tobk: that's true
 tobk: still plenty of other deterministic bots to debug against, and for a boss, a bit of randomness might even be better?
 wlesavo: i guess it matter less for the gold boss than the others
 Illedan: Nah, you want to reproduce games
 tobk: then the folks selecting the boss should have considered this...
 eulerscheZahl: usually CG checks if a boss is deterministic
 eulerscheZahl: i guess this time they didn't or accepted it
 wlesavo: but yeah would not imagine cg would take undeterministic bot
 tobk: maybe they fixed the seed but did not notice the timing thing
 wlesavo: no, i spawn in a random point as well
 wlesavo: so seed was not fixed
 Illedan: Fix seed by map?
 Illedan: Easier for yourself too..
 tobk: i mean if they inspect the code before, they might also change the code a bit, e.g. by doing a random.seed(0) before anything else
 wlesavo: i mean i always use a fixed one, just so happend i commented out it in last couple of subs
 tobk: hey, no problem for me, I was just surprised&#160;:-)
 wlesavo: Illedan actually didnot think of that, a good idea
 Illedan: Makes it easier to play against yourself&#160;;)
 Illedan: Seed on playerID
 Illedan: is enough I guess
 tobk: yeah, it means random behaviour, but not the same frst moves in every game
 Illedan: But I added islands too, just to have some difference
 tobk: I now do seed(hash(grid) + own_id)
 wlesavo: &gt; Seed on playerIDyeah, that i had
 wlesavo: first moves are quite deterministic, you minimize the information given
 dbdr: let's see how I do without the few timeouts
 dbdr: I think the slow refresh of the  lb will be especially annoying now&#160;:(
 Illedan: lb?
 dbdr: leaderboard
 Illedan: agreed
 Illedan: was more fun to watch earlier :P
 dbdr: finish you run, ait 5 minutes to know if you ended above the boss
 dbdr: though maybe the ping would work&#160;:)
 Illedan: ping?
 dbdr: promotion sound
 dbdr: notification
 Nagatwin: clock a replay and refresh it for the updated ts
 Nagatwin: click
 dbdr: true
 Nagatwin: like you vs the boss
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: Means we can automate that..
 dbdr: thanks Nagatwin
 dbdr: yeah
 wlesavo: dbdr couple of resubs should be enough for you, i basicaly didnt change anything for whole week
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/Xuyzo3.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/Xuyzo3.jpg</a>

 dbdr: above LeChuck right now&#160;:)
 dbdr: 32.2 to 32.0
 dbdr: but just lost one
 dbdr: and won one&#160;:)
 tharun571: im new to codingame , wat are the stuff interesting herer
 Nagatwin: Im kinda dragging you down
 Nagatwin: sry
 eulerscheZahl: you shall not pass!
 dbdr: well thanks eulerscheZahl!
 eulerscheZahl: tharun571 that's the interesting stuff right now: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>
 wlesavo: dbdr do you shoot after silence? that seems costly
 dbdr: I think now I use silence to get close and then shoot
 dbdr: not saying it's optimal
 wlesavo: i see
 dbdr: not this time
 kovi: even after improvement, i got totally wrecked by joli and pb4
 Illedan: Improve something else? :P 
 eulerscheZahl: you get a lot of these wins actually kovi <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447649138">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447649138</a>
 wlesavo: all the others recking me
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: tell me how&#160;:/
 kovi: euler, must be from previous submit. this time i ended up 0:6 vs joli&#160;:)
 pb4: I'd like the key against siman also
 pb4: the others, looks like I'm fine :D
 dbdr: joli is a nice nickname&#160;:)
 wlesavo: pb4 it looks that our pathfinding is wery simmilar, i guess he is quite better at some other aspects
 wlesavo: but i have a whole free weekend to come up with smth, i hope for at least some improvements
 kovi: wow
 kovi: 30% vs pb, 0% vs joli, but still 1st
 kovi: (ofc. re-submits from others)
 NormantasStankevicius: Yo, what do you get when you get a timeout?
 NormantasStankevicius: cause I'm getting "Unhandled Exception: System.FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format."
 NormantasStankevicius: I'm i'm just curious
 NormantasStankevicius: not a timeout, but response time per turn
 NormantasStankevicius: when the time is more than required
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl nice going against the boss!
 dbdr: I just beat him twice&#160;:)
 dbdr: 3
 eulerscheZahl: this submit is going better than i expected
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447659206">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447659206</a>
 dbdr: neck and neck, around 30.70
 dbdr: you?
 eulerscheZahl: 0.75 below the boss
 eulerscheZahl: give me a push
 dbdr: will do my best
 dbdr: or pull him down
 dbdr: even better for me&#160;;)
 dbdr: winning 3/1 
 dbdr: 3/2&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i got a 7-2 run against the boss
 dbdr: 4-2
 dbdr: i'm above by +0.2
 dbdr: 30.56 for boss
 eulerscheZahl: don't leave me alone with him
 eulerscheZahl: push me up, then you can go
 RoboStac: it's ok, I'm doing my best to pull dbdr back to us
 dbdr: thanks RoboStac :D
 eulerscheZahl: thank you for your service
 RoboStac:&#160;:)
 Counterbalance: NormantasStankevicius that looks like a C# error in your bot. If it crashes it won't send a command and you should see 'Timeout' in the log and as a tooltip.
 dbdr: now even the replay scores don't seem to update
 pb4: is there a way to see the boss' score&#160;?

 dbdr: see a replay
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: or cgstats
 dbdr: but replay is more up to date
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447659206">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447659206</a>
 dbdr: won 5-2!!
 eulerscheZahl: actually CGstats gets the boss score by looking at a replay
 pb4: You're pretty close to him&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, but dbdr is pushing me down&#160;:/
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/qZcuER.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/qZcuER.jpg</a>
 dbdr: this might or might not be the latest
 dbdr: crazy leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: yay!
 kovi: dbdr just resubmit with loosing on eulers inital position
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/rwxoc8">https://prnt.sc/rwxoc8</a>
 dbdr: yay!
 kovi: nice, gratz to you both
 Illedan: :clap:
 eulerscheZahl: thank you so much RoboStac and Illedan
 dbdr: not confirmed for me
 Illedan: Yeah, I won the boss
 eulerscheZahl: you two pushed me in the end
 Illedan: and lost everyone else
 dbdr: robo above
 dbdr: it's a mess
 dbdr: :D
 _rkd: hey&#160;!!bros
 eulerscheZahl: and thanks dbdr for beating the boss of course
 _rkd: i won nothing 
 dbdr: you're welcome&#160;:)
 Boulet: gg eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: now i'm losing a lot
 Illedan: lol
 eulerscheZahl: legends is mean to me
 Illedan: How many in legend now?
 eulerscheZahl: 11
 YannT: you came  up with improvements really quickly eulerscheZahl, congrats
 eulerscheZahl: decided to spam more silence
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/MDcNiS.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/MDcNiS.jpg</a>
 dbdr: why is this incoherent with the lb?
 eulerscheZahl: and realized that i mostly use a distance of 4 which wasn't intended
 eulerscheZahl: did you F5 on that replay dbdr?
 dbdr: sure
 eulerscheZahl: weird.
 dbdr: Legend
 eulerscheZahl: i saw a lower score for you when i checked your replays
 eulerscheZahl: whatever, congrats!
 dbdr: thanks!
 Boulet: gg dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: welcome to the bully league
 eulerscheZahl: let's get bullied together
 dbdr: :D
 YannT: congrats dbdr!
 Illedan: 0.01 above for me :scream:
 dbdr: merci all&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol, Cpt. LeChuck, awesome
 eulerscheZahl: nice, you know him&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Monkey Island!
 eulerscheZahl: look behind you, a 3-headed monkey!
 YannT: heyy Nagatwin made it too!
 Boulet: and you RoboStac  ?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/O3CsBf.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/O3CsBf.jpg</a>
 dbdr: good old bug :D
 Boulet: nice gg Nagatwin
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, classic
 dbdr: gogogo Illedan!
 dbdr: and robo
 RoboStac: nope, I'm stuck in gold
 dbdr: really?
 Illedan: Thx for all the points robo :D
 dbdr: must be close
 eulerscheZahl: wait till Illedan is gone, then resubmit
 RoboStac: submits finished I'm at 29.71, boss is just above 30
 Illedan: yeah, wait please
 Illedan: Without me it should be easy
 Nerchio: haha legend opened and i am top 200 in gold :p sick
 Nerchio: Illedan 1st place in gold
 Boulet: go go go  Illedan killl him 
 Illedan: Might even help robo
 RoboStac: yeah, just got promoted 
 Illedan: np
 Illedan: I have 4 recent wins :P
 Illedan: vs the boss
 Boulet: gg RoboStac
 Boulet: nice work
 dbdr: gg RoboStac!
 Boulet: with the boss 
 eulerscheZahl: so 15 in legend soon
 kovi: great, the more players the higher i get
 eulerscheZahl: and poor wlesavo losing against all of us who promote
 dbdr: nice number, let's close it&#160;;)
 dbdr: it's not like we had time to massively optimize against him
 eulerscheZahl: true
 dbdr: might come though&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: definitely was one of the harder legend leagues for me
 dbdr: what, 1 hour? :D
 eulerscheZahl: +3 weeks before
 dbdr: sure
 Boulet: and one week to go  
 eulerscheZahl: well, wasn't working on my bot the whole time
 kovi: welcome robo
 kovi: how blaster not here?
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl but im finally not last in legend! 
 wlesavo: grac btw
 Nerchio: so how good is cpt. le chuck
 kovi: he said his stable 10th
 blasterpoard: kovi I also said that I have about the same winrate against everyone
 eulerscheZahl: and Illedan with a massive 1 point lead
 Illedan: I have 80% win vs wlesavo :D
 Illedan: *boss
 wlesavo: Illedan well it is the same for now
 blasterpoard: so higher rated people at the top were actually boosting me
 wlesavo: but i have to adapt fast
 Boulet: Illedan: 10 times resubmit just to let me in the legend :D 
 Nerchio: lol funny gold bot
 Boulet: ok :door:
 Nerchio: |TORPEDO 6 3|MSG FATALITY
 Illedan: \o/
 Illedan: Legend
 Illedan: wooo
 Illedan: And level 40 :D
 ZarthaxX: lol legend lvl
 ZarthaxX: gz illo
 eulerscheZahl: congrats Illedan, finally orange
 wlesavo: grac Illedan :slight_smile:
 Istian: So, real life question. (And, holy cow, didn't realize the contest was open)... back to my question. I'm making a request(URL, {json: true})...more code. Some of what I get back has foreign special characters, but those don't get displayed properly. How can I fix this?
 Astrobytes: gz Illedan!
 eulerscheZahl: let's start with this Istian: what language are you using?
 eulerscheZahl: the answer might change depending on your answer
 Nagatwin: Owell
 Nagatwin: gone eating and i'm legend
 Boulet: double gg Illedan
 dbdr: gz Nagatwin&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you missed the most of the congratulations then Nagatwin
 Nagatwin: haha
 eulerscheZahl: i'll hereby repeat mine
 Nagatwin: nah I can see it&#160;:)
 Istian: eulerscheZahl javascript
 eulerscheZahl: then my answer is: i'm out!
 eulerscheZahl: for web requests i usually use python
 Istian:&#160;:(
 Istian: I'm super blocked with this problem
 Nagatwin: credits goes to eulerscheZahl , I have 70% winrate against him and he crushed boss
 Manish0349: I started JAVA i love to ocde so is it better to do that here?
 Manish0349: to use this platform
 Manish0349:&#160;?
 Istian: Why are all contests here based on pathfinding algos?
 MadKnight: why not Manish0349&#160;?
 MadKnight: Istian because pathfinding is the base strat 
 MadKnight: to fight
 eulerscheZahl: not all are
 MadKnight: it's like walking
 eulerscheZahl: where is the pathfinding in locam or code4life?
 rwilson:&#160;;) or <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/legends-of-code-magic">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/legends-of-code-magic</a>
 Istian: Ok, maybe not ALL... but most are
 chucknorris: code4life was fun
 MadKnight: it's built-in in referee
 Manish0349: sure  I 'll try both 
 eulerscheZahl: try to come up with an interesting game that does not involve pathfinding Istiannot that easy i think
 Manish0349: thanks @MadKnight
 MadKnight: Manish0349 both what?
 eulerscheZahl: walking around to perform actions on different places is a normal game concept
 kovi: there is at least on top3 player who dont have pathfinding in ooc
 kovi: one
 eulerscheZahl: you?
 kovi:&#160;:)
 kovi: gratz zhmyh
 Istian: I don't disagree euler, I'm likely complaining because my brain isn't evolved enough to learn the algos.
 Manish0349: to learn code from code4lif4e and other one too
 Zhmyh: oh thanks
 MadKnight: he wasn't telling that to u Manish0349
 MadKnight: he was talking to Istian, Manish0349
 Manish0349: Can you suggest some site where I learn coding and find more practice challenges as well 
 kovi: welcome jft63
 kovi: you guys suppressed that boss hard
 Nagatwin: yeah eulerscheZahl destroyed him
 eulerscheZahl: 8-1 vs wlesavo in legend now :innocent:
 kovi: yeah, just checked
 Rd211: hello
 kovi: and with massive incoming games, i gained #1&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: welcome back to the top
 eulerscheZahl: do you plan to do something about your crashes?
 kovi: do i still crash?
 eulerscheZahl: 8 times in 167 matches
 eulerscheZahl: is that the right time to say "fix it!"?
 kovi: could be last step crash instead of die
 eulerscheZahl: could be a timeout as well <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447675083">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447675083</a>
 eulerscheZahl: but true, this one is a certain death <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/447674568">https://www.codingame.com/replay/447674568</a>
 eulerscheZahl: still: fix it for easier timeout tracking
 eulerscheZahl: so it's 4 timeouts and 4 deaths
 kovi: thx
 kovi: priv?
 pb4: wut&#160;?! already 16 in legend&#160;?
 pb4: Who's the anti-wlesavo in the bunch&#160;?
 Illedan: I had 80% win vs him
 pb4: haha
 pb4: welcome in Legend then
 Illedan: I liked gold better
 Illedan: actually had a chance
 Illedan: I am getting wrecked by wala -.-
 wlesavo: dam, i realized i turned off anti silence 0 part in the boss, that would be fun little thing to have
 icecream17: oh, instead of putting mines closer toward the middle, i should put them where they are next to as much water spaces as possible
 kovi: nice submit wlesavo
 kovi: you tricked cg with a weaker boss submit
 wlesavo: thx, actualy just tweeked some parameters a bit, it did really felt like i broke smth in boss
 ThaddeusQ3: Is anyone here familiar with the Defibillators puzzle?
 ThaddeusQ3: I think I found a bug in the Answer and I don't know how to report it.
 wlesavo: thats quite unlikely
 ThaddeusQ3: Oh I know it.
 wlesavo: 4.5k people solved it successfully
 aCat: maybe try reading forum topic about it
 aCat: I'm pretty sure there was sometrhing strange about this one
 struct: 51k actually
 struct: Maybe its the ,&#160;?
 wlesavo: oh, i looked on the wrong number
 ThaddeusQ3: No i accounted for that
 struct: What do you think is the error?
 tobk: which one was that? a bit of JSON parsing and then finding the closest one?
 ThaddeusQ3: The problem is at one point I get a 'distance to nearest defib" of "0" so that's the one I use in the answer. But the answer it wants has a distance of 66.49887....
 ThaddeusQ3: I used debug messages to print out the distance calculated of the answer I reported and the answer it wanted as I moved through the code. 
 struct: Can you paste the code here?
 ThaddeusQ3: if that doesn't bother anyone
 ThaddeusQ3: vb.net
 ThaddeusQ3: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f7d338d-0488-4e02-8b74-fcb0cf4d7eed">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f7d338d-0488-4e02-8b74-fcb0cf4d7eed</a>
 darkhorse64: ThaddeusQ3: Review your code. Here lies the problem
 ThaddeusQ3: oh I didn't know it did that
 ThaddeusQ3: I am pretty sure I am screwing something up. But I cannot fathom what it could be given what the debug messages say
 struct: if Answerd = 0 Or d &lt; Answerd
 struct: So
 wlesavo: welcom blasterpoard
 struct: The error is there
 struct: Imagine that one of the distance is  0
 struct: answerD == 0
 Astrobytes: Hover over my avatar to diagnose the issue...
 struct: If you get higher distance
 struct: that is true
 struct: so it replaces it by higher distnace
 wlesavo: Astrobytes what a polite way to put it
 <b>**ThaddeusQ3 screwed it up</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> ThaddeusQ3: That's how I would put it
 struct: You understand ThaddeusQ3?
 ThaddeusQ3: yeah I got it. 
 blasterpoard: wlesavo thx
 ThaddeusQ3: Thank you guys for looking at it. 
 struct: if Answer = "" Or d &lt; Answerd
 struct: Will work
 ThaddeusQ3: gah! I didn't want the answer!
 ThaddeusQ3:&#160;:)
 struct: ups
 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: wlesavo&#160;;)
 struct: sorry&#160;:(
 ThaddeusQ3: No worries.
 ThaddeusQ3: I was just thinking that as you were typing it in I'm sure
 tobk: Astrobytes Shouldn't one of the C be a K?
 Astrobytes: tobk depends if you go for 'computer' or 'keyboard', both valid
 ThaddeusQ3: and yes I know what PEBCAK is lol
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 tobk: right, I only thought of the latter
 tobk: still confused why only ~1/3 of "registered" are in the leaderboard...
 ThaddeusQ3: There now it works. Though apparently you cannot initialize a double as "" so I used -1
 Astrobytes: Registered but didn't submit tobk
 tobk: sure, but why?
 struct: no ThaddeusQ3
 struct: You could use the Answer
 struct: and not the distance
 Astrobytes: No idea, not what I would do :shrug:
 struct: Answer == ""  at start
 kovi: gj blasterpoard
 darkhorse64: Wood2 bot is too strong
 Astrobytes: They nerfed it already though?
 ThaddeusQ3: Oh well, is submitted. So I'm up to level 6 now. Thanks again 
 darkhorse64: Yeah, but it still does tracking
 tobk: could understand if the contest is anounced months in advance and then only last a few days, many might have other obligations, but announced the same day it started and lasting a month, I'd expect more to at least submit once
 Astrobytes: I guess they have harder bosses as you have 4 weeks to work on it
 etzl: can someone help me understand how to override GetHashCode in C# please? I've read the documentation and I'm now think it is somehow arbitrary is that correct? any help is appreciated
 tobk: You mean how technically to override the default, or how a good hashcode should look like?
 Astrobytes: tobk lots of people just give up too quickly anyway, same with every contest
 etzl: how logically should override it
 etzl: I saw some code that just make a random number
 etzl: and some just perform bitwise operation on some numbers
 tobk: random is probably not good. you want different instances that are "equal" to have the same hash
 etzl: sorry for my English by the way if its incorrect
 etzl: so should i only care about that?
 etzl: and write m own logic?
 tobk: also, the hash of an object should always remain the same
 tobk: StackOverflow has some excellent answers on that
 etzl: thanks for your help&#160;:)
 YannT: if you overwrite the equals  mezthod of an object, you should also override the hashcode
 YannT: (minus typos)
 JasonTruter: don't understand
 JasonTruter: Whats the aim of this game?
 struct: Which game?
 YannT: ah C#,  not Java, possibly disregard then :p
 JasonTruter: ocean of code
 struct: To destroy enemy submarine
 JasonTruter: is it running in real time?
 struct: yes
 JasonTruter: Is my opponent another player? Or just the computer
 YannT: it's a partial information turn-based game where you have to figure out where the ennemy is and shoot them
 YannT: another player
 YannT: well their code
 JasonTruter: How would I figure it out if I can't see where they are?
 struct: You get their actions
 JasonTruter: Where's their actions
 YannT: well, given the islands and map borders, turn after turn you can eliminate locations where they could be
 JasonTruter: Sorry i'm a newb
 YannT: also after wood you get sonar
 struct: Line 3: opponentOrders, a summary of the actions (separated by |) that your opponent has made during its turn.
 JasonTruter: ah I see
 JasonTruter: So I'll work within the game loop?
 YannT: yes
 YannT: you write code in a game loop that takes some input every turn and outputs the orders you wanna make
 YannT: in this particular game there's also a part pre game loop (choosing your start position)
 JasonTruter: Interesting, so the first printing is the start position
 JasonTruter: then in the game loop is where the decisions happen
 YannT: in the stub it's hardcoded to 7,7 but you wanna make a pick based on the map
 YannT: exactly
 YannT: first you read game inputs for the turn
 YannT: then process and output your turn orders
 JasonTruter: The opponent's start position is always random?
 aCat: he chooses it
 YannT: in the IDE you pick against who you wanna play (for wood, playing the boss is fine, that's a 'computer'), but when you submit your code, you'll be matched against other players, and if you rank better than the boss you advance to the next league
 aCat: your first move is to choose your starting position
 YannT: wood2, wood1, then bronze, each step you'll get more powers to use
 Astrobytes: And the opponent does the same
 JasonTruter: So I have to basically start at my inital positon, then in the game loop for every iteration, I would try and take out the opponents submarine?
 YannT: exactly
 JasonTruter: How would I know if im close to my opponent? Or check his position? because I don't really know where it is, only the orders right?
 YannT: you can start by writing just the move orders so as not to crash, and torpedo randomly maybe
 wlesavo: you can look some replays to get the process
 JasonTruter: Sounds like a plan YannT
 YannT: first, write a move that moves around
 JasonTruter: I really like this community, you guys are very helpful!
 YannT: then you'll do torpedoes
 JasonTruter: :grinning:
 JasonTruter: The only reason I didn't play much codingame is because thought it might get difficult and I wouldn't understand
 JasonTruter: This could help improve my thinking
 wlesavo: welcome EricSMSO :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: It will be difficult and you won't understand, but if you ask the right questions everyone will help as much as they can
 aCat: for the first league it is enough if you make llong paths without chrushing, and do surface when no route available
 aCat: no need of torpedo at all ;p
 JasonTruter: ok let me start with that
 Astrobytes: *crashing acat, crashing!
 aCat:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 aCat: oh cmon ;p
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: I can hear you saying it lol
 YannT: 1) read the map initial input and pick a starting position that's not an island, 2) in the game loop, write a bot that just moves around
 YannT: once you've got that, you'll understand the game&#160;:)
 JasonTruter: shweet, thanks!
 YannT: :thumbsup:
 YannT: don't hesitate to ask if you've got questions
 YannT: someone will always answer&#160;;)
 JasonTruter: awesome
 Astrobytes: yep. Don't just give up, plenty help around if you ask
 Nerchio: can you fall down grom league/
 Nerchio: from
 YannT: no
 Astrobytes: No, you'll stay in the same one you're in
 YannT: you can be shamed by your peers tho
 Astrobytes: :D
 JasonTruter: So what I'm thinking of doing is creating a Point class and for islands, creating an array of points
 JasonTruter: To check if I'm moving into an island
 aCat: better to care about the water
 aCat: easier to manage only water points - and ignore islands and out of bounds
 blasterpoard: bitset&lt;225&gt;&#160;?
 blasterpoard: you don't want to loop over anything when checking if your next move ends up on an island
 YannT: everything in my bot is arrays if that helps
 YannT: I didn't do a "grid" thing
 YannT: I have an array of islands, and arrays of positions, paths, etc
 YannT: int[15] is what I'm working with for paths for instance (one int per row)
 YannT: positions being like x + y * 16
 Nerchio: i have 2d arrays [][] but i am not in legend&#160;;)
 YannT: it's good, that's a grid thing&#160;:)
 YannT: 15 ints is enough for the whole map tho
 Nerchio: I guess more experienced people use 1d arrays for performance
 YannT: yes, and then next level after that is bitsets
 struct: some even use 4 64 ints
 YannT: yes, or 'long' when using civilized talk :p
 Nerchio: that's a pain to handle in code isn't it
 Astrobytes: not if you know what you're doing with it
 YannT: you write your helper functions, then it's transparent mostly
 Nerchio: performance in exchange for pain
 YannT: I'm have an x(int) and y(int) and a toInt(x, y)
 blasterpoard: performance in exchange for writing another class to be able to handle it and then forget about it
 YannT: contains(int[])
 YannT: etc
 Nerchio: I have to say I started the obvious way with grid but i can see its downsides no
 Nerchio: w
 YannT: instead of beeing like position.x where position is some Pair object, you just do x(position) where position is an int
 YannT: so it's transparent
 Nerchio: easy to timeout
 YannT: a 2d array is alright, the real killer is lists, sets, etc
 YannT: if you're down to trying to get rid of your 2d array for performance, I'd say you're good
 Nerchio: not an expert about performance quite yet
 Nerchio: I have a list as well
 Nerchio: of enemy movement :D
 YannT: I mean yes, 1d array is better for perf than a 2d array, but that's not going to be your bottleneck if we're being honest, unless you're trying to win microseconds on UTTT
 YannT: lists and other collections, now that   can easily be an issue on 50ms
 Nerchio: yea i will not rewrite it now but maybe for next competition i will choose a different way
 Nerchio: something to learn
 YannT: look into bitsets
 struct: is 1d better than 2d?
 struct: Arent they the same
 YannT: one is two array lookups, the other is one
 blasterpoard: depends on language
 YannT: but again, that's unlikely to be your performance issue unless you're doing some crazy stuiff
 YannT: (like trying to get your JVM bot to legend on UTTT)
 struct: I think in c++ it doesnt matter
 blasterpoard: in C++ it should be the same afaik
 Astrobytes: C++ the compiler flattens to 1d
 YannT: bitsets are the ultimate performance thing (using an int instead of an array)
 Astrobytes: Should do in C# .NET to but euler says the mono version doesn't, so better to do it manually
 Astrobytes: *too
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I've fked up my bot enough for tonight, see you all tomorrow :P
 struct: cya
 Nerchio: bye
 Nerchio: but you're right in ooc the way you store the map is not the most important
 Nerchio: other things are more performance hindering
 YannT: yes, that's been my point since the beginning of the contest
 YannT: performance in this game is not as important
 YannT: heuristics can make it to legend
 YannT: unlike a lot of other contests where if you're not coding in C++ you start at a disadvantage
 YannT: (doesn't mean you don't have to optimize, but it's not the primary focus)
 Edrevan: Ever since they hit nerfed the time to answer, perf isn't that big an issue anymore
 YannT: they didn't?
 YannT: it's always been 50ms per turn
 Edrevan: yes they did, after coders stricke back
 YannT: it's game dependant
 YannT: varies between 50 and 100ms usually
 Edrevan: and before coders stricke back every game had more.
 Edrevan: And every contest has people in top 20 legend coding in python or funky stuff like that
 struct: Its based on game yeah
 YannT: you mean before CSB there was &lt;50ms time limits per turn?
 YannT: that's harsh
 Edrevan: no, on average more
 struct: There isnt any &lt;50
 struct: CSB was 150ms before
 YannT: so, this game being 50ms would be more restrictive then
 YannT: making my point
 Edrevan: yep
 YannT: I've been top5 with a JVM language :p
 Nerchio: top20 is 90% c++ :D
 YannT: gold boss y'all can't beat is python :p
 YannT: which is like one order of magnitude worse than JVM languages (which are one order of magnitude worse than C-like compiled languages)
 Nerchio: python is worse than java?
 struct: performance wise ye
 Nerchio: didn't know
 YannT: yes
 YannT: it's interpreted
 Nerchio: doesn't make me feel so bad about writing in java then :p
 YannT: Java has hotspot and other stuff like that, so it's intermediately better
 aCat: BTW so the top players are using normal search here? like my moves, his responses, etc?
 YannT: on CG what screws you with JVM is the GC
 aCat: Or very tricki rule-based stuff?
 YannT: aCat: mostly no I think, it very rules based
 YannT: haven't heard of minimax or stuff like that
 aCat: ouch
 YannT: there's some depth in pathing and other things tho
 aCat: yeah, I mean killermoves etc
 YannT: yeah
 aCat: damn, hate rulebaesed - it gets complicated
 YannT: everybody's got a sim and an eval and some description of look-ahead for things, but I don't think anyone's got a proper algo like minimax or whatever
 struct: What is rulebased?
 YannT: I actually tried minimax, it didn't work out, at all
 YannT: git reset
 aCat: MM probably not, but full your turn search and some eval?
 YannT: basically yes
 YannT: and opponent ply is some probabilistic stuff
 Cappefra: ugh I lost against someone for a bug in my code and I can't reproduce it cause they randomize their starting position
 aCat: ehh, and then goes to parameter tuning
 YannT: not so much, given the variance in this game parameter tuning is very big strokes :p
 aCat: I suppose I won't finish with full my-turn search although I initially planned that
 aCat: we'll se
 YannT: full your turn search is enough for legend if well evaluated
 aCat: but evaluation will be probably an issue
 YannT: + some notion of taking into account the opponent's turn (without necessarily siming him)
 aCat: there are too many things to ttake into account
 YannT: yes, I have a logarithm in there
 aCat: opponent's mines and yeah - his possible counters
 YannT: altho this entire contest is very reminiscent of locam which I think you're familiar with&#160;;)
 wlesavo: i have tanh
 wlesavo: not that useful though
 YannT: your turn, then don't sim opponent because mostly you don't know what he's gonna do
 YannT: that's where we're at anyway
 JasonTruter: Hey guys
 Nerchio: hello
 JasonTruter: So I'm considering using a map for waterPoints
 YannT: Cappefra: yeah not deterministic bots are annoying ton debug against&#160;:)
 YannT: use error output so you'll always have debug info in your replays&#160;;)
 JasonTruter: which is constant time, I'll use this just for validation
 aCat: JasonTruter I was using that for my python code to go silver
 JasonTruter: sweet, yeah I'm writing in python rn
 aCat: nice approach, easy to manage
 JasonTruter: was first in java and thought it was overkill
 JasonTruter: because had to create classes for everything
 aCat: for the first try yes
 aCat: you can switch languages to something more managable than python later
 JasonTruter: yeah
 aCat: yep
 YannT: gold boss is written in python3
 aCat: by the pro
 YannT: (meaning wlesavo wrote a  very competetitive bot in python)
 aCat: doesn't count ;p
 YannT: it counts, can be done :p
 aCat: I know, it was not against the language
 aCat: rather my code management
 aCat: in python it's too easy to yeah
 aCat: and I don't have scripts to merge  multiple python project files ;p
 YannT: I like kotlin for that
 aCat: need to leran it some day
 aCat: *learn
 YannT: mutiple classes in a single file? meh, no problem
 YannT: it's a very nice language
 YannT: aCat: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview">https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview</a>
 YannT: they have a very good thingy for learning the language
 YannT: with an online IDE and stuff
 JasonTruter: Does this seem weird if I create a waterPointsMap, store the key as the coords and value as true?
 aCat: yes
 aCat: use sets
 JasonTruter: but I have to loop through in a set
 JasonTruter: with a map, I just access using a key
 YannT: it *is* an optimisation over sets, because constant time, but also it would be premature optimisation&#160;:)
 YannT: so you're reasonaning is right, but I'd say go simple to start
 YannT: your*
 JasonTruter: I would have thought it would be easier to just check that map if its a valid move 
 JasonTruter: so its a single line of code
 YannT: .contains() is also a python thing no?&#160;;)
 aCat: x in y ;p
 JasonTruter: thats true
 JasonTruter: aCat wanting me to write more imperitive code :P
 YannT: your thinking is right tho, with a hasmap it would be constant time as opposed to linear time with a collection, so that is an optimization
 YannT: one that really doesn't matter at the point you're at tho&#160;;)
 JasonTruter: I guess you're right when thinking in the purest form
 YannT: always go simple/naive at first
 YannT: rework when something becomes a problem, not before&#160;:)
 YannT: otherwise you get lost in details
 YannT: there'll be like [0;15] islands anyway, so the difference is negligible
 Cappefra: how does the sonar answer come back to me? is it like Parse(inputs[8]);?
 Cappefra: I might have written over it the first time I unlocked it
 YannT: aCat: someone has questions about a puzzle of yours on #fr
 YannT: A*
 YannT: I sent him to you :p
 VYCanisMajoris: I PM him
 Cappefra: Oh I found my bug btw, I was setting my position to visited after a surface by passing it the position object instead of a copy of it, so if I moved on the same turn after surfacing, the surface spot wasn't being marked as visited
 Nerchio: woops 
 YannT: VYCanisMajoris: nice&#160;:)
 VYCanisMajoris: He did'nt answer for now
 YannT: we were talking 10mn ago so I hope he's still around
 VYCanisMajoris: ok cool
 Nerchio: i am going to refactor a little bit to see if i can tackle cpt. lechuck tomorrow
 Nerchio: so far probably 1% winrate
 Cappefra: I still get my butt kicked by haddock and I don't really know what I'm doing wrong
 Cappefra: it might be time to implement the sonar haha
 Nerchio: I had to iron out my bugs to beat silver
 Nerchio: i had occassional timeouts
 Nerchio: my bot still went into islands for some reason in some games
 YannT: Cappefra: haddoick is silver boss right?
 YannT: use mines
 Cappefra: it is
 YannT: he doesn't avoid them
 YannT: good pathing + mines is basically enough normally
 YannT: he'll walk right into them
 Cappefra: debugging hard is what I've been doing today. At a point I was mostly beating the bot so I felt confident but I didn't get past silver rank 70
 Cappefra: thanks for the tip Yann!
 YannT: the trick to silver is essentially, do mines
 YannT: and don't get shot
 YannT: anhd you should be good
 Nerchio: yea mines are op in silver for sure
 Nerchio: but i didn't use mines
 Cappefra: @YannT that second one is tricky
 Nerchio: and i lost most of my games to mine players
 Nerchio: i dont track mines at all yet
 Nerchio: will add mines to beat mr chuck
 YannT: Cappefra: you do ennemy detection right? use the same process for self detection and silence when you're about discovered&#160;;)
 Cappefra: I do! I'm trying to find the right balance between powering up/using silence and mines
 YannT: you should always use a move every turn
 Cappefra: I also do that
 YannT: silence is trickier but for silver, basically silver when opponent knows where you are
 YannT: and spam mines&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: (unless you're at 1hp and have no place to go; then you should spam triggers)
 blasterpoard: not that it ever matters
 YannT: that's extremely situational and you should not bother with that :p
 YannT: just move every turn and spam mines, silence when opponent has you detected, and have good torpedo etiquette, you'll be good
 Nerchio: when i started writing i did everything in 1 class in java because this small window was intimidating
 Cappefra: it's all about finding that sweet spot
 Nerchio: around bronze i moved to an IDE and i ctrl+c ctrl+v now 
 Cappefra: yeah I did the same
 JasonTruter: what do you think is a good way to identify a point as a single value? 'x y'?
 JasonTruter: since i'll use this identifier for everything in the code
 Nerchio: xy is probably fine if you want to use it as a key like you said before
 Cappefra: I think my problem could be in my movement now.. I focused on navigating through the map as long as possible before having to surface, avoiding deadlocks and all that, but moving too much in one direction probably gives me away really soon
 Cappefra: ugh I put a lot of effort into that
 JasonTruter: So do I use the sonar to check if my opponent is close to me?
 JasonTruter: It's probably best to first think of how I will manuver the map to actually find my opponent else I'll be searching forever
 YannT: Cappefra: now you're getting the game&#160;:)
 YannT: longuest path is a thing, but not the only one&#160;;)
 JasonTruter: Wouldn't it be best to think about how you indend on finding the submarine first?
 JasonTruter: before you even touch code
 YannT: you could run self-detection on yourself (same algo you have for opponent) and use that&#160;;)
 YannT: JasonTruter: you're in different leagues, you should do moving :D
 Nerchio: until mid bronze my bot was running around the map moving and shooting randomly
 Nerchio: had 0 tracking
 Nerchio: actually it kind of still is moving and shooting randomly
 YannT: Cappefra is doing silver, at that point self detection and acting on it becomes a thing :p
 Nerchio: just a little bit better
 YannT: for wood &gt; silver, just moving is the focus
 Nerchio: yea i said it to Jason
 Nerchio: silver was kind of random for me because everyone was good at different thing
 Nerchio: one guy tracking and shooting, other guy mines, other silence etc.
 YannT: ahah yeah&#160;:)
 Nerchio: and countering everything was tough
 Nerchio: i feel like i got to gold kind of undeserved since i didn't change much of my code
 YannT: there's a guy before gold opened who got top10 with just moving+torpedo too
 YannT: I wouldn't necessarily recommand that :p
 Nerchio: impressive
 Nerchio: but at some point if you do good decisions based on enemy location movement and shooting can take you pretty far
 Nerchio: i am in gold and my bot still moves in enemy's range like nothing can happen 
 blasterpoard: I am in legend and the only fighting my bot does is "shoot torpedo if it does at least 0.75 dmg on average"
 Nerchio: mines I guess? they are the strongest in this game i think
 blasterpoard: mine spam and movement
 YannT: hey gg blasterpoard
 YannT: didn't see you come in&#160;:)
 blasterpoard: thx YannT... might be my last submit until the last day though
 Illedan: hiding?&#160;:(
 blasterpoard: might be necessary
 YannT: I don't see why unless you have a nouvel strategy
 Nerchio: so guys use the local version of the game?
 blasterpoard: YannT well, just some small stuff that people do and it gives away their position
 blasterpoard: I'll PM you one thing I noticed, keep it to yourself and you can check how good it is
 YannT: alright&#160;:)
 Nerchio: i am getting crushed in gold haha
 pb4: blasterpoard&#160;: you know I can keep secrets too :zipper_mouth:
 blasterpoard: at some point it's no longer a secret
 blasterpoard: I was just making a point that there's stuff worth hiding
 pb4: As in any contest, optimal strategy involves hiding
 blasterpoard: at this point, I can prove it just by saying that YannT doesn't say anything about it xD
 pb4: haha :D
 pb4: I've decided not to hide though, no more fun if everybody does it
 pb4: Curious to know what you noticed though&#160;:) do tell us after the contest end&#160;!
 blasterpoard: I'm not sure how much I'll hide for the last submit yet
 YannT: I'll just say this: that's a good observation&#160;:)
 Illedan: hmm
 Abius: oof I finally submitted my code
 Abius: seems like its winning all fights :D
 Nerchio: gj
 Abius: 1000 lines of agony that was
 Nerchio: i am also at 1000 lines
 Abius: what rank are you
 Nerchio: gold
 Abius: nice. I'm 1st at bronze when will I promote to silver then gold?
 Nerchio: if you are first then less than few minutes
 Nerchio: to silver
 Nerchio: i am going to bed cya guys tomorrow
 Abius: cu
 JasonTruter: I see with movement its much better to work with a custom data type
 JasonTruter: as working directly with x and y gets confusing
 JasonTruter: and manging decisions of multiple moves
 Abius: what language?
 JasonTruter: python
 JasonTruter: example a Move class
 Abius: I'm using x and ywithout problem throughout the code
 JasonTruter: I feel that as you use decisions you would need to use your current coordinates to increase and decrease by 1
 JasonTruter: to choose the direction
 Nicky1812: guys?
 Abius: yes?
 Nicky1812: how to input a list in python?
 Abius: you don't. you just get a string and then split
 Nicky1812: example pls 
 AbiusX: list=input().split(" ");
 Abius: How does Haddock find you? Is he cheating?
 Nicky1812:&#160;?
 Nicky1812: and wait, how to convert a number to char in ascii table?
 Nicky1812: ok i've got it
 Abius: it's usually the ord function
 Nicky1812: yep ord and chr right?
 Abius: ord and chr
 Abius: yea
 Nicky1812: ok
 Nicky1812: thx
 elsinnombre2d2: is it possible to take a bot from the leaderboard?
 rwilson: elsinnombre2d2&#160;? take a bot , meaning what?    to fight against it?
 elsinnombre2d2: yup
 rwilson: elsinnombre2d2 anyone in your league or lower yes...    bottom seciton with player/options ...  'DELETE' the boss &amp; find someone else
 elsinnombre2d2: im refactoring and i need a bot that doesnt destroy me in 50 steps  xD
 elsinnombre2d2: thanks!!

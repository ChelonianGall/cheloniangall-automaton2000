 Sketeer232: I cant write "HELLO_WORLD" for some reason (C# btw)
 Sketeer232: im so mad rn
 C26_1: Yea
 C26_1: C, C+, C# are not suck somehow
 Ajaiy: What code did you write to print "Hello world"?
 Ajaiy: Generally it is Console.WriteLine("HELLO_WORLD");
 C26_1: Debated problem: Does OOP sucks?
 Thorcode: haha
 mr.mister: pls help
 mr.mister: this is the task
 mr.mister: There is a tired runner Jack. In the ith second, he can only run (actually walk) 1/i meter.Now you are given the track length k. You need to calculate how many seconds (rounded up) will it take him to finish the track.
 mr.mister: but input is only one int
 mr.mister: is "i" an constant I do not know about?
 C26_1: i is a variable
 Thorcode: bruh
 C26_1: a looped variable specificlly
 Thorcode: this is super ez
 C26_1: Need the code?
 Thorcode: I think
 mr.mister: don't want code
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: how about algo?
 mr.mister: want to understand how do I get i?
 Ajaiy: 1) Declare a variable s=1.2) Keep subtracting 1/s from k while it is greater than 0. Add 1 to s after each iteration.3)Print s - 1
 Thorcode: what lang
 C26_1: ok
 mr.mister: Ajaiy can you explain why did you declare s as 1, what's the logic behind it?
 Thorcode: it could be s=0
 C26_1: 1) Declare a variable s=02) Take k - 1/i3) i increased by 1
 C26_1: wait
 C26_1: sorry

 devmaxime: in the 2048 scores puzzle, the example give a starting position with an 2 and a 4. Why there is a 4&#160;? the game 2048 always start with two 2. Is it specific to the puzzle or I didn't understood something&#160;?
 Uljahn: "the game 2048 always start with two 2" - you are wrong here
 Uljahn: it's just the probability of 4 is much lower
 Thorcode: in that puzzle some guy are super pro
 tomek112358: hi
 surgutti: hi, does CGFunge Prime problem have Carmichael numbers in test cases?
 derjack: devmaxime Uljahn still for this particular puzzle, the probability of 4 is 50%, rather than usual 10%

 InCog: how do you do this
 InCog: without loops
 InCog: I swear I dont see a way to do it without loops but that could just me being dumb and inexperienced
 BlaiseEbuth: Why don't you want to use loops?
 InCog: as in you can
 InCog: but it times out
 InCog: at least on my end
 InCog: during the loop detection cases
 5DN1L: You detect a loop then stops there and calculates from there.
 InCog: oh
 InCog: aight so you just do until you get your first circle
 5DN1L: cycle, yes
 InCog: Aight thanks
 Korythekory: x.extend(a)x.extend(b) 
 Korythekory: are they different?
 InCog: I dont think they are
 InCog: wait actually 
 InCog: they can be I guess
 InCog: if a is a string 
 Korythekory: aha
 InCog: then the string is treated sort off like an array 
 InCog: then each individual character is appended as opposed to the whole list
 InCog: string*
 Korythekory: okay you meant if a is 'good', it is appended like 'g' 'o' 'o' 'd'?
 InCog: yeah
 InCog: I think so
 InCog: havent done python in too long but thats how it works I think
 Korythekory: Thanks.
 jacek: yes
 InCog: can I ask is there a way to assign a value to a variable and make it immutable within a loop in javascript
 InCog: like within a for loop can you assign a variable an array value and make that array value immutable outside of the loop
 InCog: Nevermind I am stupid I forgot const exists

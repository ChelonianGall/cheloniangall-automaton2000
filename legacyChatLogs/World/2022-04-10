 TIKTOK2001: xd
 TIKTOK2001: can u help me
 ycsvenom: xsd
 ycsvenom: on what?
 TIKTOK2001: find a job for litlle money
 royal1456:&#160;:|
 ycsvenom: you asked the wrong person
 ycsvenom: i am unemployed
 TIKTOK2001: xd
 TIKTOK2001: fuk
 ycsvenom: that's a correct one XD
 TIKTOK2001: lets make project 
 TIKTOK2001: for money 
 HoangH7: Hi
 ycsvenom: what do you have in mind
 ycsvenom: hello
 HoangH7: What are you doing right now?
 TIKTOK2001: hmm i see guy make money from little games they make 
 TIKTOK2001: in steam 
 TIKTOK2001: how they make it 
 TIKTOK2001: look this 
 ycsvenom: i am trying to be the best problem solver ever
 TIKTOK2001: vampire survivors
 eulerscheZahl: an ambitious goal
 ycsvenom: isn't it
 TIKTOK2001: xd
 ycsvenom: i can't even beat you in 100 years eulerscheZahl
 ycsvenom: do you know anything about game engines TIKTOK2001?
 HoangH7: Are you gen-Z tiktok?
 TIKTOK2001: i know its very hard when u make it alone 
 TIKTOK2001: but is not impossible 
 ycsvenom: you didn't answer my question
 ycsvenom: and it's not
 TIKTOK2001: i try unity and unreal 4 
 ycsvenom: did you make anything with it
 TIKTOK2001: no 
 ycsvenom: do have any experience in OOP and Data Structure
 TIKTOK2001: bec i dont believe i can make it 
 TIKTOK2001: no but information is in youtube internet and is free if u want to learn 
 ycsvenom: it's a faith you have to pursue programming and make shitty code to be able to make actual games or projects
 ycsvenom: i know it's free but no one solves calculus without knowing the basic operations
 TIKTOK2001: true but i want to fly before walk 
 TIKTOK2001: xd
 ycsvenom: it's possible if you work hard enough
 ycsvenom: 18 hours a day for a year will make optimus prime
 ycsvenom: make you*
 ycsvenom: XD
 TIKTOK2001: true but i cant wait 
 ycsvenom: then you can't learn either
 TIKTOK2001: xd
 TIKTOK2001: i need money 
 TIKTOK2001: true 
 ycsvenom: how old are you?
 TIKTOK2001: 18
 TIKTOK2001: i learn in university 
 TIKTOK2001: 20* wtf
 TIKTOK2001: NBU in bulgaria
 ycsvenom: learn need patience
 TIKTOK2001: true 
 TIKTOK2001: but i can look kids make milion 
 ycsvenom: no born a scientist every person born stupid as fbut we all learnedif you want to excel at programming you have to die practicing
 ycsvenom: they already learned in young age
 TIKTOK2001: yea
 TIKTOK2001: xd
 TIKTOK2001: so i nedd years of practising to make shit 
 ycsvenom: it depends on your knowledgeif you learned shit you will not make anything but shit XD
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall are ridiculous. me age 11, made games in ASM on 8 bit computers w/ very little information, no market.  Yall age 18, big market 64 bit computers big info. ... too lazy.  We both learn more in our rooms answering hard questions by experimentation than any college could provide.  I'll shut up now
 ycsvenom: PatrickMcGinnisll Hooray ,Congratulations you are better than every creature

 jacek: longer link plx
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sry, didn't see it
 eulerscheZahl: "it's 70 degrees F here, gonna be a beutiful day"
 Passifi: and know how to spell
 eulerscheZahl: and if you tell me you are 6'3, i don't know how tall you are
 MSmits: maybe he was talking about an F-angle being 70 degrees?
 jacek: oO
 eulerscheZahl: did some trigonometry for the featured puzzle
 MSmits: I still have to finish it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol,185cm
 MSmits: know how to do it, but have been lazy coding it
 MSmits: it's a cool puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure, why my escape code works, but it's all green
 eulerscheZahl: so i'll take it
 eulerscheZahl: are you clearing your desk to get some time for the upcoming contest?
 MSmits: isn't it like 3 parts: Move to center, get to the opposite side of the cat on the edge of the circle within which the cat is circling faster, then dash&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: dash?
 MSmits: mouse I mean
 MSmits: yeah run to edge
 Wontonimo: yup, those are the 3 parts i did
 eulerscheZahl: that's pretty much what I do. but my math tells me i'm going to get eaten. and i still run for it and survive
 MSmits: But yea, i'll join the contest. 
 MSmits: Most of it is a vacation week for me, so lucky
 eulerscheZahl: same for me. but not by coincidence&#160;;)
 MSmits: aha
 MSmits: so will they do one of these a year now?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea
 MSmits: ah ok
 eulerscheZahl: with the loss of the mod badge i also lost a source of insider info
 MSmits: I hope it's not a rehashed contest where people can mostly submit their old code
 Wontonimo: it is telling that they went back to it after trying the escape maze
 MSmits: could be they just want diversity
 eulerscheZahl: that's what CG wrote on the mods channel, Wontonimo?
 Wontonimo: true
 Wontonimo: nothing
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Wontonimo: it's pretty dead there
 MSmits: oh by the way, professor X got back to me about oware
 eulerscheZahl: by the way I know CG, they don't even know the format of the next contest themselves yet
 MSmits: he's going to play a game with me
 eulerscheZahl: cool
 eulerscheZahl: when?
 MSmits: but still waiting for scheduling options
 MSmits: mailing is slow, he responded to my application like a month later
 ethaneCH3CH3: #taco
 eulerscheZahl:  /join taco
 eulerscheZahl: try that
 eulerscheZahl: maybe he has a lot of games to play
 MSmits: yeah could be
 MSmits: or just busy
 MSmits: he says he wants to try a game up until i hit my endgame book and then use the rest of the game to verify it
 eulerscheZahl: the prof for my final thesis wasn't that quick at responding either
 MSmits: we should get the same results when 12 seeds are captured since we both solved it then
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: youre doing that playok thing?
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: nice
 eulerscheZahl: beat him. eat him alive and dance on his grave. you got this
 MSmits: will certainly try&#160;:)
 MSmits: i boosted my meta mcts code today
 MSmits: added some ab pruning to the solving part
 ethaneCH3CH3: join my clash?
 ethaneCH3CH3: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/233613622ff3f1567e35cbd80daf699988f4d2f">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/233613622ff3f1567e35cbd80daf699988f4d2f</a>
 antiwonto: [auto] hey ethaneCH3CH3 dont paste those links here.  Use the channel #clash
 MSmits: he can cheat though. If he avoids capture moves, he can outlast my meta mcts
 eulerscheZahl: thanks antiwonto
 eulerscheZahl: but he doesn't know that
 MSmits: if he's smart he does
 MSmits: he probably is if he solved oware :P
 eulerscheZahl: we'll see is his claims are true
 MSmits: that's true. But he already beat the world champion
 MSmits: but i kinda figure jacek would beat the world champion too
 eulerscheZahl: did you just tell him that you want to play or also about your approach?
 jacek: on solved drawn game?
 MSmits: told him some of my approach
 MSmits: yeah jacek, i dont mean you'd beat his database, i mean the best human player
 jacek: should tell him about CG's oware
 MSmits: yeah will do if i get a chance
 jacek: i think even my old non NN would beat best human
 eulerscheZahl: use the in-game chat during the match and distract him
 MSmits: I might 
 MSmits: maybe he'll do an input error :P
 eulerscheZahl: just saw that I won a dollar :o<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/9VLOIPs.png">https://i.imgur.com/9VLOIPs.png</a>
 MSmits: yay!
 eulerscheZahl: a week of hard work paying off
 MSmits: indeed
 MSmits: first place?
 MSmits: heavily sponsored contest i guess&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: well, counts towards a 3 month period leaderboard. i might have qualified for finals (still 1 match going)
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: maybe you'll win more dollars
 eulerscheZahl: would be in the US, the trip alone is in the 4 digits
 MSmits: but the first dollar is free
 eulerscheZahl: no, they would pay the trip too
 MSmits: oh nice
 MSmits: make sure you get a return ticket too
 MSmits: otherwise you'll have to sneak on some oil tanker or some such
 eulerscheZahl: great tip
 MSmits: is this google hash code or something else?
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder open
 MSmits: ahh ok
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tco22.topcoder.com/competition/marathon?tracks">https://tco22.topcoder.com/competition/marathon?tracks</a>[marathon-tabs]=0&amp;tracks[mm-tco22]=1
 eulerscheZahl: bad URL, you have to copy it
 eulerscheZahl: and leaderboard isn't updated yet
 MSmits: Do you still get better over time?
 MSmits: you've been doing this for quite a while
 eulerscheZahl: i think that yes: i am still improving. partially on a mental level, having trust in my own abilities
 MSmits: ahh well good
 MSmits: I think i still improve as well, but my performance on contests drops because my obsessiveness reduces faster than my skill increases&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i know what you are talking about
 eulerscheZahl: less sleepless nights, thinking about the problem
 MSmits: exactly
 jacek: less sleepless?
 MSmits: he means fewer
 MSmits: he's not less sleepless
 MSmits: he has fewer of those nights
 eulerscheZahl: more sleepful
 MSmits: oh
 jacek: ah
 MSmits: either way works :P
 jacek: sleepfewer
 eulerscheZahl: ~ less sleeplesssleepless: No such file or directory
 DomiKo: MSmits google hash code don't have trip&#160;:(
 MSmits: it did before I think
 jacek: but they banned acid
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather do it remotely tbh
 DomiKo: But now is endless covid time
 MSmits: true
 DomiKo: And btw Euler how was yours Hashcode? Because I never asked
 eulerscheZahl: 118th i think
 eulerscheZahl: started well but ran out of ideas quickly
 eulerscheZahl: did you qualify for finals again?
 eulerscheZahl: i know that kovi made it
 DomiKo: I never qualified before. My friends did.
 eulerscheZahl: oh, sorry. did you qualify this time?
 DomiKo: Yeah, first time :D
 eulerscheZahl: congrats then
 DomiKo: 29th 
 eulerscheZahl: 1 behind team pani iirc. that's kovi
 DomiKo: nice
 DomiKo: We was 1st for like a hour, and then we could improve
 eulerscheZahl: my bad, it's ANIP
 kovi: oh, gratz DomiKo! (we were 26th)
 DomiKo: Its always funny how this contest is about sorting thing in the right way
 DomiKo: gratz you too
 eulerscheZahl: it's a heuristics contest
 eulerscheZahl: too huge inputs for some serious optimization in that short amount of time
 DomiKo: But there are some subtasks
 DomiKo: This time subtask (E) was really simple
 eulerscheZahl: maybe that's my mistake. i always try to code a generic solution and ignore the special properties of each testcase
 kovi: generic greedy is important imho
 DomiKo: it is but it won't win the contest
 kovi: than it can be finetuned or localopted
 kovi: finetuned/localopted-toward specfic testcases separately
 kovi: for the finals i started looking errichtos yt
 DomiKo: So if finals were onsite I would get the chance to meet Kovi wow
 DomiKo: now I miss them even more
 eulerscheZahl: let's do topcoder marathons instead. stage 4 just started
 eulerscheZahl: with an optim on wednesday
 eulerscheZahl: and tourist will be there too
 DomiKo: but I've met him before
 eulerscheZahl: you've beaten him in kart driving
 DomiKo: WOW
 DomiKo: you remember lol
 eulerscheZahl: wow?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i have an surprisingly accurate memory, even after years. other times i quickly forget things
 eulerscheZahl: like when inoryy trained a NN chatbot based on MK
 eulerscheZahl: i completely forgot that until reCurse mentioned it. then 2 years later he surprised me again and pulled up old chatlogs from the first time he told me about it
 DomiKo: interesting 
 Wontonimo: but isn't that just regular human memory ... very selective to the observer
 eulerscheZahl: probably
 DomiKo: but sometimes we surprise even ourselves
 Wontonimo: i'm surprised that i remember  anything at all tbh
 DomiKo: xd
 Wontonimo: the more I learn about Neuralnets, the more I question human intelligence 
 MSmits: the more i learn about humans, the more I question human intelligence
 DomiKo: :joy:
 Wontonimo: coming from a teacher :scream:
 MSmits: well i deal with a selection of humans 
 MSmits: they are not representative of the species
 jacek: he trains human NNs
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: to overfit in final exams
 MSmits: they do that&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: and they believe that is the&#160;;
 Wontonimo: and more sad, they believe that is the point
 MSmits: well i guess they know it's not, but that doesn't change their behavior
 MSmits: knowing and doing are different things
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, my GF is a teacher... she is untrainable
 MSmits: thankfully next year I no longer teach any physics. It's a lot less about exams with computer science
 MSmits: mostly about creativity and solving problems
 DomiKo: true
 Wontonimo: oh, I thought you enjoyed the physics
 MSmits: I do enjoy it, just not as much as CS. Also, I was mostly referring to the exam-part of it
 Wontonimo: and you put so much into developing the course, it's a shame you can't reuse all that work
 MSmits: physics has a national bar where every student has to pass the same exam
 MSmits: CS is whatever the teacher makes of it and there is no national exam
 Wontonimo: I did something like that for AP Physics way back in '89
 eulerscheZahl: wait a few years until the higher ups hear that computers and such exist
 MSmits: Wontonimo well I guess I spent some time making powerpoints, tests and experiments, but I reused them a lot. 
 MSmits: they just renewed the CS curriculum, i mean there are some demands on what I teach in the class, but they are very vague
 MSmits: like the AI part is described in maybe  3 sentences
 MSmits: in physics, every part of it is described exactly and if you deviate slightly your students grades will be lower
 MSmits: you know exactly all the formula's they have to be able to use and other skills they need to have
 Wontonimo: I do believe in national (or world) testing standards for some things.  Of course it can be perverted easily
 MSmits: all the scientific terms etc.
 MSmits: yeah it's good that they exist
 MSmits: but for a teacher it's not a fun thing to be so limited in your choices
 MSmits: your only choice is how to teach, not what to teach
 MSmits: in CS it's how to teach and 80% of what to teach
 Wontonimo: that's fun, and I bet stressful for some teachers
 MSmits: yeah especially if your grades are low
 MSmits: thankfully mine were always ok
 Wontonimo: I'd like that freedom 
 MSmits: oh you mean stressful to have choices
 MSmits: well there's premade stuff you can use
 MSmits: I think it's not good enough so I make my own
 MSmits: boring theory stuff. I like it when my students are actually making things using what they learn
 MSmits: with some theory stuff sprinkled in
 MSmits: me and my colleague set up our own Moodle environment with a lot of courses and each year we make the curriculum by selecting from the courses we created
 MSmits: we have an AI course, 2 programming courses, HTML/CSS etc.
 MSmits: exercises with automatic feedback and such are built in. It's a very relaxed way of teaching. They just go and I walk around and help out
 jacek: its fun when i could finally used the physics formula in the game engine and see them for myself
 MSmits: yeah that's exactly why we do this. Their first programming experience is the python turtle thing where they write code to make squares and such
 MSmits: the final assignment is making your own christmas card
 MSmits: with code
 jacek: all these squares make a circle...
 MSmits: what reference is that?
 jacek: dbz abridged
 eulerscheZahl: random video for the python teacher<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxklT94W0I&amp;ab_channel=Programmersarealsohuman">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxklT94W0I&amp;ab_channel=Programmersarealsohuman</a>
 jacek: searching random videos with python tag is quite risky
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't searching for it. nick chapsas got me on that channel
 MSmits: well that just might be the data google has on you jacek :p
 MSmits: funny video&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: there's a 2nd one about python<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnL9vAFphmE&amp;ab_channel=Programmersarealsohuman">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnL9vAFphmE&amp;ab_channel=Programmersarealsohuman</a>
 Scarfield: soon enough you will teach Yavalath theory
 MSmits: maybe when I get too many students
 jacek: you can teach this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/aVXPWyO/aQRDVRWX_700w_0.jpg">https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/aVXPWyO/aQRDVRWX_700w_0.jpg</a>
 MSmits: cool
 Justin_Lowry: im live on twitch if any1 wants to watch
 jacek: clashy?
 Wontonimo: oh my eulerscheZahl, that video has TOO many zooms.  Funny, just making me dizzy
 Wontonimo: "I just learned that on ude ... I mean medium an hour ago"  :joy:
 madmax7874: Hello! check out my first contribution :grinning:
 Westicles: there's no point in writing a description for reverse, nobody will see it
 Wontonimo: the first validator does not match the edge cases of the first test
 Wontonimo: match the tests and validators around the same edge cases
 Wontonimo: your first test does not use repeats
 Wontonimo: a better first validator would be1EA DA KA KA NA  = HELLO
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: wsp
 Wontonimo: exact same edge cases, exact same logic, proves validation isn't hard coded to test madmax7874
 Westicles: doesn't matter, smurfs approval
 madmax7874: yaa no point in writing one but it asked for it so i wrote it lol
 madmax7874: i started with no repeat and then went to repeats and then random chars
 Wontonimo: looks like 2 people already approved.  I doubt they did the whole process of approval
 Wontonimo: including creating a solution, verifying that it can be done for them in 5 min, making sure the template code works in all languages
 madmax7874: what is your doubt @Wontonimo&#160;? I hope i will solve it
 Westicles: It is too hard for a reverse
 jacek: that what she...
 madmax7874: I actually had another key for count character encryption as well, i removed it cause that felt difficult
 Westicles: how is some 12 year old supposed to figure this out?
 madmax7874: its easy by looking at the tc now
 Wontonimo: these two other accounts that have approved your contribution seem all too sus about how fast they have approved and are not sharing their original solution
 Wontonimo: usually contribs take about 2-3 weeks to get approval, so it's really sus when your first gets 2 approvals within minutes
 madmax7874: I created this clash a few days back, not today
 Wontonimo: true
 OussamaOz: MOROCCO
 Darleanow: guys&#160;!!
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/13809523b6f4264412cb3a43a7c45c16f967a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/13809523b6f4264412cb3a43a7c45c16f967a</a>
 Wontonimo: for what it is worth, madmax7874 and the two approvers all have different IPs, so that's nice
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i always feel the urge to downvote when someone asks me to upvote
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 eulerscheZahl: also: we already have 34 fibonacci puzzles :o<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=fibonacci&amp;category=ANY&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/?q=fibonacci&amp;category=ANY&amp;title=on&amp;statement=on&amp;tests=on&amp;comments=on&amp;tags=on&amp;author=on</a>
 VizGhar: especially CoC
 madmax7874: how did you check my ip bruh
 Wontonimo: I'm a mod
 eulerscheZahl: via forum, moderation tools
 Darleanow: go ahead, i juust want opinions&#160;!:)
 madmax7874: ooo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what VizGhar said
 eulerscheZahl: let's return a program, that would be an original task actually
 eulerscheZahl: print("program code for printing fibonacci numbers")
 eulerscheZahl: well, we kind of have that for CGFunge prime
 Wontonimo: hey Darleanow, what euler is saying is that there is already a lot of fib contributions.  do something different
 Darleanow: aight wonto&#160;:)
 Darleanow: thanks
 Wontonimo: if you are looking for feedback (to help with your next contrib) , don't have 'python-like' output.  instead of [1, 1, 2, 3] as the output, instead have 1 1 2 3
 eulerscheZahl: nothing personal, it also annoys me when youtubers ask me to like and subscribe. i skip that part, even if i know it's just 5 seconds
 madmax7874: please check my contri and tell me what else can i do better
 Wontonimo: please make the changes I suggested to the test/validate.  The 1st test and 1st validate should be related to the same scenario, as with the 2nd and 2nd, etc
 madmax7874: yes i made those changes
 Westicles: make it fastest instead of reverse
 Andriamanitra: i don't think reverse needs to be removed necessarily, but yeah i would add fastest
 madmax7874: okay, added fastest and shortest mode as well
 Wontonimo: thanks for making those changes.  i've removed the rejection
 madmax7874: thank you for your help :grinning:
 Wontonimo: as a suggestion, your test2/validator2 introduce 2 new changes&#160;: different N and second character other than A.  Just do one or the other
 madmax7874: second character other than A is already in test 1
 Wontonimo: to help approvers test all languages, make the default stub output the answer to test1.  This makes it very easy for approvers to go through all languages and make sure they all work
 madmax7874: okay will do it
 eulerscheZahl: do you seriously test all languages when validating?
 eulerscheZahl: not even I do that. and i think i'm a thorough reviewer
 Wontonimo: yes, it's easy when the stub outputs the first test
 madmax7874: done
 eulerscheZahl: i check the generated code for a few languages to see special cases. but definitely not all 25
 Westicles: I generally check Fortran, Octave, and Julia as well to make sure it is future-proof
 eulerscheZahl: troll
 jacek: dont forget rust
 Wontonimo: I also removed my downvote madmax7874.  Thanks for genuinely listening.  
 eulerscheZahl: java and c# have different codes for instance to parse an array. one does a readline().split(), the other uses an input scanner
 madmax7874: thanks wonto
 eulerscheZahl: plain C important to check for strings, checking the length

 madmax7874: :cry:
 Scarfield: 68 downvotes would be an oof, some people just look, but not necesarilly want to engage enough to actually go through the process of testing
 madmax7874: fair point
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 a-Rye: lol madmax7874 1,966 people have looked at my playground...only 16 people liked it. Ok ok, 15 and myself :sweat_smile:
 Kawaii-san_Shadow_Wolf: hows everyone
 madmax7874: omg a-Rye :joy:
 madmax7874: im in pre final year, i wish codingame comes on my campus for placements:heart_eyes:
 VizGhar: Yeah... but have you noticed? The Troll vs Castles is resubmitted&#160;:| 
 Scarfield: 290 on the leaderboard for a contrib xD
 Westicles: Wontonimo, please go visit Dwarkadas
 Wontonimo: what is that?
 Wontonimo: and no, i'm not going to google it
 Westicles: madmax's school
 Wontonimo: oh.  if you are paying, sure!
 Scarfield: antiwonto lmgtfy dwarkadas

 Scarfield: Wontonimo taco
 Wontonimo: the lmgtfy is poorly documented&#160;;(
 madmax7874: its cool though
 Scarfield: you cant give out tacos oO
 Wontonimo: i'm planning on moving all but give taco to the taco channel.  anyone object seriously?
 Wontonimo: all taco commands 
 a-Rye: I dunno, I think the tacos add to the world chat
 Scarfield: oh did see taco channel mentioned yesterday, forgot about it
 a-Rye: see? we can't let the tacos vanish...
 Westicles: move it to #fr instead
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy::sweat_smile::sob:
 PainEXE: #asdda
 Scarfield: hmm not sure, it would be more fun to have it in world, but in can get "obnoxious" when it takes over the chat
 PainEXE: what the
 PainEXE: u can just make infinite chats?
 Scarfield: #taco
 PainEXE: #taco2

 VizGhar: How do you guys debug tree searching algos in multis (BFS, DFS, BEAM, MCTS)? Thats where I use to struggle
 Wontonimo: unit tests are my friend for those
 VizGhar: No visualisation?
 Wontonimo: nope.  for example, my UTTT code is about 550 lines of C++, and in addition to that i have 650 lines of C++ unit tests
 VizGhar: mg :D ok thanks
 Wontonimo: Here is an example of a DFS unit test answer I gave on SO <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64974829/search-not-working-for-river-crossing-problem-in-python/64993148#64993148</a>
 Wontonimo: notice, there isn't much unit test in the way of the actual DFS recursion, but all the previous unit tests really raise confidence in where the errors arn't
 VizGhar: Are tests something you tend to use during contests as well?
 Wontonimo: sigh ... not as much as for multis.  But I reuse my mcts and alphabeta code from multis and focus my unit tests on making sure the simulation rules are bang on
 VizGhar: :thumbsup: ty&#160;:) I need another year to excel
 VizGhar: (I was talking about UTTT too, not that I put too much time into it but yeah)
 Wontonimo:&#160;?!? what?  When I joined you inspired me to excel
 Wontonimo: :grin: 
 VizGhar: Not sure about that, but you are welcome

 Shrimpster: I don't have any unit tests and 600 lines of code&#160;:) 
 jacek: unit tests are for noobs. only productions tests are pro
 python_dev: in my view you are wrong
 Shrimpster: yo jacek what does one have to do to break top 20 legendary? Normal MCTS solver isn't enough 
 Wontonimo: good way of making sure you are on call to fight production fires jacek, and with that you can probably charge more because you'll be the onlyone who knows where the bugs come from
 VizGhar: He is allowed to be wrong, he is owning many multis python_dev :P
 Wontonimo: go NN Shrimpster 
 Shrimpster: me or jace VizGhar&#160;? 
 jacek: Shrimpster teccles opening; decisive/anti-decisive moves; some bonus for moves that win small board; some penalty for giving opponent more mobility
 python_dev: what are multis?
 Shrimpster: yeah Wontonimo, I've thought of that, maybe jacek could tell me something more precise I wanted to know 
 jacek: and yes, mine is NN
 Westicles: i got to bronze in tron
 jacek: :tada:
 VizGhar: Shrimpster I was talking about jace
 Wontonimo: woot&#160;!  way to multi Westicles
 VizGhar: :nerd:
 Shrimpster: What do you mean decisive and antidecisive moves jacek&#160;? 
 jacek: do you make all completely random moves in rollouts?
 Shrimpster: Yeah
 jacek: or every move checks for 1-ply win and if there is one, it chooses it?
 Wontonimo: I played with 2x weight for corners and centre
 Shrimpster: ah you mean if there's a winning move for a small gridcell to chose it?
 jacek: overall game
 jacek: though you can give more probabilty for winning small board
 Shrimpster: isn't that too expensive? 
 Wontonimo: optimize it&#160;;)
 Shrimpster: Words of a true master Wontonimo
 jacek: depends on game, i think it gave me ~55% winrate
 jacek: in othello it would be useless. in yavalath its a must-have

 jacek: do you have local arena where you pit your bots?
 Shrimpster: no
 Wontonimo: he caught up to me with it :scream_cat:  
 Shrimpster: that's what Im too lazy to do
 jacek: i do some semi-manual binary search of C and other parameters
 jacek: and some params can be surprising
 jacek: like 0.5 vs sqrt(2)
 jacek: then 0.25 vs 0.5
 Wontonimo: if you want to go NN then you'll have to get a local pit going

 Passifi: Seeing that nickname confirms my fear that we have run out of reasonable names to have, we must reset society soon
 Westicles: German military spending up €100 billion :thinking:
 SenzuBean: what's going on
 Nicora: chillin
 Nicora: codin
 Passifi: I have no faith in my people properly destroying the world. We lost our evil edge. Our passion for hatred. If we want the world to burn we need to get switzerland involved 
 Passifi: or some nation even more evil
 Westicles: maybe canada, those guys are vicious
 Passifi: I want a reset not for the planet to be uninhabitble afterwards, can you imagine a dead planet covered in maple syrup *shudder*
 Shrimpster: Evilness has left Europe I think, we need to get our claws back
 Shrimpster: Yeah maple syrup :yum:
 Wontonimo: by the late 90's Canada was responsible for 80% of all landmine manufacturing in the world.  Although I love Canada, we were not always the happy go lucky maple syrup drinking igloo livin people
 Passifi: Oh I always knew you were evil, ever since I heard that maple syrup is this ridiculously expensive because of some seriously over the top lobby stuff.
 Passifi: I wanted to google that and then I found out that canada has a maple syrup reserve.... that is so cute I can't be mad at you guys.. ^^
 Westicles: And all their SorryMate landmines apologized after blowing your leg off
 Wontonimo: and free healthcare to fix it
 Wontonimo: and a monthly allowance to help you take time off work to recover
 Passifi: might come because of your neighbor to the south but pretty much all of europe has free healthcare and pays you when your leg gets blown off :relaxed: plus we don't have to deal with a wave  of us  fugitives every time a republican president gets elected
 Passifi: ha it's good to live in the old world
 Wontonimo: we have the second largest country in the world and a population less than half of Germany.  More educated liberals coming to our country?  Cool
 Wontonimo: someone just needs to tell them that hiking across the border in the middle of winter without proper mittens will lead to the loss of your hands&#160;;(  
 HoneyGlazedGherkinsEggTartare: Canada — 9,879,750 km²China — 9,600,013 km²China is warmer
 Passifi: frankly i didn't even think that canada had 40 million people.. . but the more you know
 Wontonimo: if you count all the land that China has purchased in Africa lately to fulfill its food needs, then it is the second largest for sure.
 Passifi: and I didn't know it was bigger than china :sweat_smile:
 Westicles: Canada has all that oil sand, or as we call it in the US, our retirement plan
 Wontonimo: i don't get it Westicles 
 Wontonimo: :thinking:
 Westicles: when the oil runs out we'll come knocking
 Westicles: we'll give you star 51, you'll love it
 Wontonimo: yup.  It's a fine line between being able to get a premium on a limited resource vs encouraging others to take it by force.  That's one reason why Canada sells it's water for cheap
 Passifi: Invading a cold country doesn't usually bode well for the invaders , napoleon made that discovery along with other european nations throughout history
 Passifi: New Model Army taught me that one already belongs to britain
 Wontonimo: US 2902 km3 of fresh water , Canada 2840 km3 of fresh water but 1/10th the population... so nearly 10 times the fresh water per person.

 zakacat: how can I search for puzzles by keyword
 zakacat: like I wanna practice BSTs
 Wontonimo: have you tried the search box at the top?
 Ayza: I am assuming he means searching it by the skills like Memoization, recursion, loops, etc
 zakacat: I do yah, I think that search only shows users?
 zakacat: maybe I am mistaken
 Wontonimo: you can click on any skill and it will take you to a page that groups puzzles by that skill
 Wontonimo: for example, if you go to my page <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/d0699d9a8e4995e142b0a5cf6a16e1934361804">https://www.codingame.com/profile/d0699d9a8e4995e142b0a5cf6a16e1934361804</a> and scroll down to the skills

 Wontonimo: show you a nice graphic of pathfinding, some external links, and related puzzles and multis
 Wontonimo: uh, I've only completed 13% of the pathfinding puzzles.  weird.
 Wontonimo: does that help zakacat&#160;?
 zakacat: Um, yes it does haha, so they don't have a feature yet to navigate by a directory of tags
 zakacat: It is nice that I can find the collection after I click the tag
 zakacat: but it is kinda just searching around until I find the tag I want
 zakacat: but!
 zakacat: I did find a Binary Tree puzzle to try
 zakacat: so, we are all good
 zakacat: I'd love to try and make some puzzles this summer.
 ZndrBrok: Hi guys, any tips on how to calculate the speed of the pod in mad pod racing&#160;? #NoobLifeMatter 
 Wontonimo: yes,
 Wontonimo: it isn't too complicated
 Wontonimo: create a new variable
 Wontonimo: at the end of your main game loop assign it the values of x and y
 Wontonimo: prev_x = xprev_y = y
 Wontonimo: then in your game loop your velocity is
 Wontonimo: velocity_x = x - prev_x
 Wontonimo: same with y
 Wontonimo: when you declare prev_x and prev_y do it above the main game loop so they are not re-initialized
 Wontonimo: does that help ZndrBrok&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: Yes that help but i am a little bit tired, can u explain me the difference between the speed of my pod and x_velocity + y_velocity&#160;? If i want to show the speed of my pod how can i use the x &amp; y velocity&#160;?
 Wontonimo: you don't need your speed that i know of.  
 Wontonimo: but to figure the sum of 2 dimensions that are at 90 degrees from eachother use the sqrt of the squares like so
 Wontonimo: sqrt( x_vel^2 + y_vel^2 )
 zakacat: the resultant vector
 zakacat: :nerd:
 Wontonimo: indeed
 ZndrBrok: I love u guys!
 ZndrBrok: Thx
 Wontonimo: why do you need that&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: haha
 ZndrBrok: I know i don't need it but i have seen an ennemy pod who showed the speed in a white-box and i finded that cool... :P PS: I just get to bronze and seying my speed in real time will help me see the inpact of my changes with the thrust&#160;!
 ZndrBrok: At least, it's what i think!
 Wontonimo: congrats!  getting to bronze without anyone spoiling it for you is a good accomplishment
 ZndrBrok: Thx for yout help!
 ZndrBrok: Really&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: thx haha
 Wontonimo: have you heard of PID controllers?  It's what makes cruise control work and autopilot
 Wontonimo: here is a paper on it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 Wontonimo: if you are calculating speed (which is the derivative of position over time) you are already calculating the D of PID
 Wontonimo: P = position.  So you've got 2 of 3 already and arguably the I (integration) is optional
 ZndrBrok: I have seen an external-link to wikipedia but i havn't dive in it!  
 ZndrBrok: Okok, i will dive in that tomorow after a good night of sleep! 
 Wontonimo: that paper I linked is the best, easiest read, that i've found
 ZndrBrok: Thx for all; i really appreciate it!
 Wontonimo: if you find something better PLEASE let me know
 Wontonimo: yeah, np
 ZndrBrok: Yes, it's a lot beter than wikipedia article haha
 ZndrBrok: i will&#160;!
 ZndrBrok: But i doubt i will find better than u :P
 ZndrBrok: Have a good day/night!
 Wontonimo: thanks (night for me)
 zakacat: good night, thanks for the info
 Nik05: Got a hole book on that stuff. Not sure how much I still know about it..
 Wontonimo: about PID or autopilot and cruise control?
 Nik05: Control Systems
 Wontonimo: yeah, i had a course in it long ago.  Totally forgot its application to physics systems like this
 Wontonimo: if you have that knowhow Nik05 , you could probably get to mid Gold in Mad Pod Racing and also finish out Mars lander 2 easy enough
 zakacat: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Nik05: I will try later Wontonimo
 Nik05: was first doing that mouse pool thing, was way over complicating it...
 zakacat: what is an example of a control system that isn't physical?
 zakacat: I skimmed that pdf. looks cool. I am def gonna come back to that. I just finished Calc 2
 Nik05: But seeing other solutions, it looks like most people found the solution elsewhere. They use the same naming for actions to take...
 zakacat: and I would like to use it practically
 zakacat: I def just brute forced that mouse problem
 Nik05: Maybe it can be used in financial models?
 Nik05: Cant come up with something non physical
 zakacat: makes sense 
 Wontonimo: electrical systems, sound systems
 Wontonimo: shocks in cars is a simple PID
 Wontonimo: 1 dimensional 
 Nik05: Those are all physical though
 Wontonimo: the spring is the (P)osition correction, and the dashpot is the (D)erivitive part.  No integration
 zakacat: Derivatives are way better than integrals anyways
 Nik05: I guess the integral part shows up in electrical systems with capacitors?
 Wontonimo: I recently helped a friend with their uni project to make an oven temp controller.  The objective was to heat the oven as fast as possible (for smelting) but only overshoot the upper temp limit by a given margin
 Wontonimo: guess what .... PID
 Wontonimo: 1 dimensional again.  And integration helped.  All computer code on an arduino 
 Nik05: nice
 Wontonimo: there was an additional issue that the thermostat was very error prone and every reading could be off by 10-20  degrees and then sometimes 200-500 degrees off
 zakacat: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Nik05: wait 200-500 degrees error?
 Wontonimo: yeah, buggy
 zakacat: that sounds like a cool project
 Nik05: So how did you fine tune it&gt;
 zakacat: average?
 Wontonimo: so easy enough, I suggested that they add a change limit, and a reading, no matter how large, can only modify the estimated real temperature by the min(change, limit)
 Wontonimo: it worked really well to get rid of those blips
 Wontonimo: I wasn't even in the class.  it's been over 25 years since i went to school.  I just helped them  for a couple hours.  gave them a bunch of equations, coded a bit
 zakacat: I am not great at electricity :grimacing:
 Nik05: I known the physics behind electromagnetism, but I dont know much about electrical systems
 Wontonimo: me neither&#160;:(
 Nik05: Hm electromagnetism goes over my head now as well :P
 Nik05: Something something, Maxwell and relativity and then you get EM :P
 Nik05: Have a good night, will check those suggestions later&#160;;)
 Nik05: I should really try to do that mars lander one. 
 Nik05: Wontonimo what those bronze/silver/gold mean? I don't see that mentioned in the problem
 Nik05: i should sleep, cant even talk properly anymore
 zakacat: g'night 
 Wontonimo: good night
 Wontonimo: i'm heading off also
 zakacat: throw taco
 antiwonto: [auto] zakacat has thrown 1 :taco:s on the floor for the taking but 1 was eaten by a software bug!
 zakacat: it was nice while it lasted
 Wontonimo: why you do that?
 Wontonimo: that was your last taco, and throwing tacos always results in 1 loss 
 Wontonimo: :taco: zakacat
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded zakacat 1 tacos. zakacat now has 1 taco. Wontonimo now has 16 taco
 zakacat: haha, cause I think it is funny
 Wontonimo: build up a savings of 3 tacos and you can use the :taco: [user name] command to get 1 taco for being generous
 zakacat: ohhhh okay
 zakacat: and what happens at 10?
 Wontonimo: you can only pick up as many tacos from the ground as you have + 1.  Currently you can pick up at most 2 tacos from the floor.
 Wontonimo: I can pick up 17
 Wontonimo: at 10 and you eat them and gain powers (which don't do anything yet)
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 zakacat: ahaha, hilarious
 Wontonimo: oh, there are 10 tacos on the floor now
 zakacat: okay
 Wontonimo: take them!
 zakacat: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] zakacat has taken 2 :taco:s off the floor and now has 3.  There are 5 left
 Wontonimo: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has taken 3 :taco:s off the floor and now has 19.  There are 2 left
 Wontonimo: again!
 zakacat: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] zakacat has taken 2 :taco:s off the floor and now has 5.  There are 0 left
 Wontonimo: there ya go, now you have to power to award someone free tacos once per day ... like maybe me&#160;?
 zakacat: :taco: Wontonimo
 antiwonto: [auto] zakacat has awarded Wontonimo 5 tacos. Wontonimo now has 24 taco. zakacat now has 6 taco
 Wontonimo: I did a shakedown in the #taco channel, if you are wondering where the tacos came from
 zakacat: haha
 Wontonimo: this all came from an ongoing joke about a year ago
 zakacat: o, btw it says that I gave u 5 tacos, but I think that was my balance prior?
 zakacat: What was the joke?
 Wontonimo: yeah, you can give at most min(your taco count, 10)
 zakacat: ahh
 zakacat: gotcha
 Wontonimo: about a year ago I put on my profile "send tacos" 
 Wontonimo: and some kind souls started sending me tacos in chat after helping
 zakacat: haha
 zakacat: ill mail you a taco sometime
 Wontonimo: yeah, so i wrote the antiwonto bot to make it a game-ish thing
 Wontonimo: i mean, initially antiwonto was just to tell people to stop spamming and bad links
 Wontonimo: well, half the code is just copied straight from automaton2000
 zakacat: what database do you use for the tacos?
 Wontonimo: file system.  just write it to a json file.  really low tech
 Wontonimo: here's the code btw <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/panchishin/cgchat">https://github.com/panchishin/cgchat</a>
 Wontonimo: javascript / node
 zakacat: right, okay, and that file is stored on the site server with everything else? I know nothing about web development
 Wontonimo: the site server lol.  nope, runs on my laptop
 Wontonimo: sorry, that wasn't meant as a laugh about you.  i was laughing at myself about how rinkydink it is
 zakacat: well, yah I may sound daft, but then antiwonto would only run when u have ur laptop on?
 zakacat: I can take it. I got thick skin
 zakacat: haha
 Wontonimo: no no, sorry if it sounded that way
 Wontonimo: i just can't be bothered to run it as a proper server
 zakacat: I tried my hand at a discord bot once I think using JS and node, but I was just following instructions, I had no idea what was going on
 zakacat: I should practice JS a bit. Would you recommend just redoing a puzzle already completed with a new language?
 Wontonimo: yeah, that could work
 Wontonimo: what's your current language of choice?
 zakacat: only Java
 BillGates1955: cool chlash
 Wontonimo: okay, so java and javascript are super different in nature
 zakacat: haha that is what they taught Comp Sci in college with and also my Android course was with Java, but I'd like to pick up Kotlin, JS, and Haskell 
 Wontonimo: java is object oriented 
 zakacat: and JS is scripting, right?
 Wontonimo: and javascript a prototype language
 Wontonimo: no, it isn't "scripting"
 Wontonimo: so, they both do things like x = y+1;
 Wontonimo: and they both have functions
 Wontonimo: and you can formulate the solution to problems in very similar ways to java when doing it in javascript
 zakacat: ah
 Wontonimo: but javascript isn't object oriented.
 zakacat: interesting
 zakacat: so, is it arguably easier?
 Wontonimo: it is why more dynamic than that
 Wontonimo: i like it now, but for the first 2 years I used it I cursed every day that it wan't java
 Wontonimo: then i realized it has its own strengths, it's own beauty, and now I use it way more than java
 zakacat: huh, cool
 zakacat: thanks for the info
 Wontonimo: i like your idea of trying to redo puzzles you've already accomplished 
 Wontonimo: that's great.  start with something simple

 MAWAAW: They said Allotted response time to output is ≤ 5 seconds.
 MAWAAW: with only 2.3 seconds I have "Your calculation timed out!"
 MAWAAW: whats going on
 zakacat: Why are there so many spammers?
 Wontonimo: the timeout is probably 2 sec
 zakacat: travelling salesman is an NP problem , right?
 Wontonimo: there were a lot more before antiwonto came along.  it still can't kick people, which is sad.  would really like to have that automated
 zakacat: throw tacos at em and then ban em
 Wontonimo: yeah NP.  Doesn't mean you can't make fast and mostly correctly algo

 zakacat: I find the concept of NP vs. P problems intriguing. 
 Kaelidian: Drones is exhausting me
 Wontonimo: dont paste solutions here MAWAAW
 MAWAAW: actually it's not a solution
 MAWAAW: btw some useful feedback is welcome
 Kaelidian: I can't keep TID updated where I need it to be so my genetic algorithm is too stupid to win lol
 MAWAAW: it can't be &lt;2seconds 
 MAWAAW: @wontonimo I have also 2 sec with literally 0 code
 MAWAAW: oh ok I got it the problem was the end="" I dont know why
 Wontonimo: if you don't send a new line at the end of your output it doesn't get sent in some cases
 MAWAAW: 250555
 MAWAAW: nice 96th for the first try
 MAWAAW: oof 96 / 124 :D nvm

 LIES.: anyone solution for the game mad pod racing level 1&#160;?
 Wontonimo: you are in wood 1&#160;?
 LIES.: i'm beginning
 Wontonimo: did you find the bug in the code yet where it is targeting Y,Y instead of X,Y
 LIES.: but i have a problem, the move so fast, so how fix that
 Wontonimo: paste the print line here
 Wontonimo: let's take a look at what you have now
 LIES.: look at 
 LIES.:  // Edit this line to output the target position
 Wontonimo: you need to print outx y speed
 Wontonimo: what you are printing out isx 100 y 15
 Wontonimo: so it thinks you are targeting the location (x,100) with a speed of y
 Wontonimo: oh, even worse,
 Wontonimo: you are printingy 100 x 15
 Wontonimo: change it to this
 Wontonimo: System.out.println(nextCheckpointX + nextCheckpointX + " 80");
 Wontonimo: sorry ...
 Wontonimo: this
 Wontonimo: tell us how that does 
 LIES.: same problem :v
 LIES.: x is my position and y is the power
 Wontonimo: oh ... sorry, i forgot the space
 Wontonimo: System.out.println(nextCheckpointX + " " + nextCheckpointY + " 80");
 Wontonimo: LIES.&#160;?  how did that do?
 LIES.: thanks bro y got it
 Wontonimo: okay, that should carry you for a rank and put you in wood 1

 LIES.: i wood 2 :v
 Wontonimo: 0.5 bitcoins will be plenty
 LIES.: i could for the other life&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: what other variables do you have?  Do you have distance to checkpoint and angle to checkpoint?
 LIES.: yep, i have to try to resolve that
 Wontonimo:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: what?
 Wontonimo: in the code you have, what variables do you have?
 LIES.: I wanted to tell, i try resolve

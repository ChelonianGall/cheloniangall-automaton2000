 MasterCoderxD: not me bro, but i wanna try it
 DaBestest: I've done like hackthissite basic stuff, but nothing other than that...  
 Saad-py: ohhhhhhhhhhh
 Saad-py: Hi sup DaBastest
 Saad-py: Remember me
 Sayach8: how long does it generally take for a clash of code contribution to get accepted or rejected?
 Saad-py: idk
 Uljahn: less than a month, why do you care?
 Sayach8: submitted my first contribution. so was wondering.
 Uljahn: clash approvement process is pretty wild and low-effort most of the time, so don't keep expectations high
 Sayach8: ok.  Thanks.
 Saad-py: Well how do I contribute
 Saad-py: do I need to pay
 Saad-py: or is it free
 jacek: you pay with your soul
 Saad-py: lol
 MSmits: best way to spend it imho
 jacek: soul for a clash?
 MSmits: nah everything but that
 MSmits: so i spent a day trying to fit parameters for a new random rollout and it was doing somewhat poorly (-5% WR). turns out I was always picking the first empty move on the miniboard =/
 MSmits: I can't believe this wasn't worse than that
 MSmits: just -5% ...
 MSmits: ohh, maybe it was because i only did this on  a free move, limited damage
 Westicles: Sorry Sayach8, it looked like you put a lot of work into that
 Sayach8: yes
 Sayach8: but turned out that someone came up with a similar idea
 Westicles: It was really identical, even the other solution worked for yours
 Sayach8: btw is there any way to know if there exists a similar solution?
 Sayach8: i understand
 Westicles: You can look through here
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 Sayach8: ok. thanks. needed this very much :relaxed:
 jacek: stupid clobber, it's so unnable
 jacek: MSmits might like clobber. there is many endgames to calculate and store
 MSmits: cool
 jacek: so yeah, a math :unamused:
 GiorgosGiorgakis: hi guys
 Wontonimo: hello there internet person
 IamQuan: hi&#160;:))
 jacek: ohai
 UnnamedCodinGamer: when using bit boards to represent game states is there a way to get the "from" cell without iterating over each bit?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am looking at clobber at the moment
 jacek: dunno. im iterating
 UnnamedCodinGamer: hm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: i tried iterating over bits for the same reason trying breakthrough
 UnnamedCodinGamer: at the end it was slower than the no bit board implementation 
 Wontonimo: what's the 'from' cell?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: move from cell A to cell B 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the position of the cell that is about to move
 jacek: well bitboards allow for quick checking isOver, getWinner and other things
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I used it for move generation
 Wontonimo: lets say 5th position to 8th positionboard = board - (1&lt;&lt;5) + (1&lt;&lt;8)
 Wontonimo: to test 5th, you could use (board &amp; (1&lt;&lt;5))&gt;0
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but in move generation you get a board with all available moves
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you have to then find which of the moves corresponds to which piece 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you can do this easily by iterating over the bits
 Wontonimo: There's a great PDF titled BITBOARD METHODS FOR GAMESCameron Browne1 QUT, Brisbane, Australia.  Hope you can google and find it.  It has some great bitboard optimizations
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I am reading it at the moment
 Wontonimo: ah.  okay, then i'm out of bullets
 UnnamedCodinGamer: below figure 8 it says that the from cell can be recovered as the cell that must exist in the opposite direction
 UnnamedCodinGamer: which as I understand it needs iteration over bits
 darkhorse64: hint: iterate over set bits
 UnnamedCodinGamer: how can I get only the collection of the set bits?
 darkhorse64: there are functions to find leading or trailing ones
 darkhorse64: and then you xor the current bit and iterate again
 jacek: hmm
 UnnamedCodinGamer: is this going to be faster that going through the bits?
 darkhorse64: having issues&#160;?
 darkhorse64: @jacek
 UnnamedCodinGamer: *than
 jacek: i havent thought about that before
 jacek: that would be much useful in amazons when you only have 4 bits
 jacek: set
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6edf8a5-561d-4142-b038-04dd634857d6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d6edf8a5-561d-4142-b038-04dd634857d6</a>
 darkhorse64: All my loops on bits are built this way. Of course, if all bits are set, it's overkill
 Astrobytes: Yeah, you should check for that
 Astrobytes: nice clobber bot jacek
 darkhorse64: ^
 jacek: clopper
 Astrobytes: :o
 jacek: its just mcts
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks guys, I will try this out
 Or64bit: Hey guys
 Or64bit: Anybody up with some basic postgresql knowledge?
 Or64bit: I have to log onto a port that I have username and password to but it says I have an auth error
 Or64bit: any idea why,
 Or64bit:&#160;?
 userdanydan: it is probably because there is an auth error
 Wontonimo:&#160;:( my bot got up to 35th in uttt temporarily and got my hopes up but then finished its arena contest at 66th... sigh... the ups and downs of watching the arena test live
 Wontonimo: the scores are pretty smooth up here with about 0.1 trueskill difference between positions
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 UnnamedCodinGamer: 66th is pretty good
 UnnamedCodinGamer: best I have seen is 144th&#160;:)
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but I guess this is what you get with such small iteration count
 Wontonimo: last night i finally made a local test bed to compare different versions locally.  Makes 2 versions compete for 80 battles, 40 each with first move.  Hasn't yet given me a huge insight other than that when I picked my hyperparameters I totally lucked out and picked exactly the right ones.
 jacek: 80 games? i usually use 1000 games
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i was hoping that there was optimization available there
 jacek: yeah, most my arse-pulled handtuned parameters are already close to optimal
 Wontonimo: jacek thanks,  i'll try upping. the count
 jacek: most often than not ill get 47 63 initially just to get 550 450 in the end
 Wontonimo: right ... stats works best with bigger numbers&#160;:)
 jacek: of course it takes more time to complete
 Wontonimo: well then, time to burn more cpu!
 Wontonimo: I need a cluster of 1000 raspberry pi and it'll complete in 15 seconds

 MasterCoderxD: I presume the shortest route is travelling in one straight line
 MasterCoderxD: but the question says he breaks his initial (straight line) path and makes another
 Wontonimo: right, so there are two legs to the travel, the first on land to a point where the beach meets the water, and a second leg from that point to the ball.  Both are straight, but not necessarily parallel
 MasterCoderxD: ohk
 Wontonimo: This may help <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law</a>
 MasterCoderxD: I am just thinking on how to approach it, using trigonometry or calculus
 Wontonimo: I added that as one of the tags, but it appears to have been removed prior to final publishing (not by me)
 MasterCoderxD: oh thanks for the link
 MasterCoderxD: ok
 MasterCoderxD: ty
 Wontonimo: it is possible to do it without calc
 MasterCoderxD: ok
 Wontonimo: hey, thanks for doing my puzzle!  It was my first contribution
 MasterCoderxD: ok np
 geppoz: spoiler alert: T = L* √((x-x1)²+(y-y1)²) + W*√((x2-x)²+(y2-y)²)
 geppoz: find min for x
 MasterCoderxD: what's L and W?
 geppoz: speeds
 MasterCoderxD: x and y are?
 MasterCoderxD: ballx and bally?
 geppoz: x is the output to find, y is beach_y
 MasterCoderxD: okie thank  u
 MasterCoderxD: lemme try by myself too though :joy:
 geppoz: so seems it is needed also derivative calculus
 MasterCoderxD: yeah
 MasterCoderxD: i am still in hs, so i am fresh with calc
 MasterCoderxD: what's T?
 MasterCoderxD: time?
 geppoz: y, is the value to minimize
 MasterCoderxD: k

 tridvajedan: how do you calculate a median?
 geppoz: I haven't solved it yet :D
 Pon4ik: guys, what do i have to do with "nextCheckpointDist" in race game?
 MasterCoderxD: how do i approve a contribution?
 RalseiOwO: you get the median from a sorted array, then get the value in the middle of the array  tridvajedan
 Westicles: You can only use approved tags, but the autofill list of tag includes every tag anyone has ever tried
 MasterCoderxD: i don't understand

 MasterCoderxD: it's for the xp thing :joy:
 GiorgosGiorgakis: where is the next button?
 AntiSquid: doesn't mean much and besides you can get xp from other sources
 MasterCoderxD: i am a hackerrank guy, i am just trying this out
 MasterCoderxD: plus i thought his contribution was cool
 AntiSquid: forget hackerrank culture, this is CG
 MasterCoderxD: hackerrank is more popular
 MasterCoderxD: bruh
 MasterCoderxD: :rolling_eyes::joy:
 AntiSquid: facebook and twitter are more popular, popularity isn't a good thing
 AntiSquid: it just means it caters to more people, doesn't reflect quality
 MasterCoderxD: k not into arguments
 AntiSquid: sure, but take CG as it is, forget other sites 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's not really comparable in that respect.
 MasterCoderxD: you r ranked 11?? in the world??gg Antisquid
 MasterCoderxD: :scream:
 MasterCoderxD: gg to u too Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: when you do a contest you get the overall idea of this site
 MasterCoderxD: i am only 16, u guys r my inspiration :joy:
 AntiSquid: at the moment it's quiet
 Astrobytes: It's just a number. There are far more skilled players here with lower levels, they onyl play what interests them
 Astrobytes: *only
 MasterCoderxD: my clash of code rank is 2000, that good?
 MasterCoderxD: u r right
 AntiSquid: play some multis, see what you like, when you get stuck as questions, try to engage in meaningful conversations
 MSmits: hey Astrobytes I just tested hashing of late game states in uttt. I get about 30% hits with 5 boards finished or more. Not worth it
 MasterCoderxD: k but antisquid u didn't answer my question lol
 AntiSquid: i think clash is just to get going with coding something
 Astrobytes: Ah. Not much has really worked with your new UTTT bots MSmits
 MSmits: that's uttt for you
 Astrobytes: Yep. Defies all reason.
 AntiSquid: the end goal imo is to play a multi, probably even make a book for UTTT, linearly optimize the crap out of it and submit spam
 MSmits: nice early solve here though: ply 37 out of 67, p1 hashbot, p2 bot without hash
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/530048846">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/530048846</a>
 Astrobytes: Nice early solve yeah but not exactly an improvement over the other D:
 Astrobytes: * :D
 MSmits: my thought exactly
 MSmits: i'll submit the hashbot to test it, just in case I'm missing something
 jacek: so you mastered endgames. now try to get to them
 MSmits: thats the idea&#160;:)
 MSmits: I also tried biased randomfor selecting a random miniboard in sim, had a good system for it, slowed down my bot, same winrate
 MSmits: I think what hurts my hashbot is that I had to let go of my "ab pruning" in my solver. it's hard enough to combine TT with ab in a minimax, trying to both with a mct solver seems too hard
 AntiSquid: how come there's no referee for hanabi (fireworks)
 Wontonimo: jacek - about the 1000 tests, thanks again.  turns out that indeed the early results were wrong
 jacek: you can choose if you want to show the referee to download
 jacek: Wontonimo you need more confidence
 Astrobytes: tric trac didn't link it AntiSquid, I don't think it's really needed though
 MSmits: yes Wontonimo, stand up straight, be assertive!
 Wontonimo: jacek , like personally or are you talking stats :O 
 Wontonimo: haha
 jacek: yes
 MSmits: it's annoying that hashing states is so often just not worth it or just barely worth it. On which boardgames on CG did it turn out to be worthwhile?
 Omer_ctr: why is this giving me nothing&#160;?
 Omer_ctr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65277fd6-f9b9-4de6-ac4a-69752248db87">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/65277fd6-f9b9-4de6-ac4a-69752248db87</a>
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit
 Omer_ctr:&#160;???
 MSmits: I'm not even sure what language that is Omer_ctr
 Omer_ctr: thats javascript
 MSmits: is that output or error printing?
 MSmits: because if you're trying to debug, you need to error print
 Omer_ctr: it gives me nothing in output
 MSmits: but do you want normal output or debug output?
 MSmits: it matters
 Omer_ctr: normal output
 MSmits: is it asking for several lines of print?
 MSmits: output i mean
 Omer_ctr: it says Found: Nothing
 MSmits: probably you were supposed to give one line
 MSmits: and your first line was nothing
 MSmits: kinda hard to know when we dont even know if this is a clash or puzzle or somethign else, better link what you're doing
 Omer_ctr: this is clash
 Omer_ctr: bro im tired with javascript
 MSmits: i was tired of javascript before even starting
 MSmits: must be those glowing testimonials
 RSBat: MSmits do you treat all equal states as equal? ie finished miniboards regardless of moves in it?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i even go further than you i think
 Omer_ctr: i learned python in like 3 weeks
 MSmits: there are only 8629 unique miniboard states in my system
 Omer_ctr: 2 months of learning js but still begginer
 karliso: TT in uttt? I don't know about that.... 30% seems quite high. 
 MSmits: i have a special miniboard system that turns the 19683 variations you get with a ternary representation into a 8629 variant representation, where a board is just a number between 0 and 8629
 MSmits: these are as unique as they can be
 karliso: There are only 8629 variations?
 RSBat: what about last move position? sometimes it can be stored differently too
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: let me show you
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05f37f17-df3f-4b6d-b471-a77f801780eb">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/05f37f17-df3f-4b6d-b471-a77f801780eb</a>
 MSmits: these two are identical
 MSmits: in both cases p1 wins in 1 move
 MSmits: and p2 draws
 MSmits: RSBat i do this too yes
 MSmits: a free move is a free move, no matter where it's targeted
 MSmits: i give it index 9
 MSmits: as opposed to 0-8 being regular last moves
 RSBat: ok, cool
 MSmits: there are ways to make the 8629 even smaller, but it's extremely expensive
 karliso: Would a board with empty cell 4 would be identical as well?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: different possible futures
 MSmits: all possible futures and the way the board affects the big board, needs to be identical
 karliso: If they are both free moves then they are same.
 MSmits: you can have identical boards with 2 empty squares
 MSmits: yes, 
 MSmits: thats what i meant by making the 8629 even smaller
 MSmits: you cant use that in a live bot
 MSmits: there will be 512 different coordinate systems then, depending on the makeup of the main board
 MSmits: i calculated all of those
 MSmits: the 8612 goes down to 2k/3k realistically in some cases
 MSmits: with 1 board left it's only like 110 or so, but whats the point
 MSmits: you could use this system for your lookups karliso
 karliso: no, thanks
 MSmits: from what you shared before you use a biased lookup for picking moves
 karliso: :D
 MSmits: or at least you lookup your random moves
 MSmits: so i guessed it migth be biased
 MSmits: for example, giving winning moves more probability
 karliso: I always take a winning move in rollouts
 karliso: Never even tried otherwise
 MSmits: you mean a miniboard win?
 karliso: Yes
 MSmits: weird
 MSmits: when i tried it, it was worse, not sure why
 MSmits: I have a win/block random
 MSmits: to get a bit more variation in the rollouts
 karliso: More variation is not necessarly better.. and winnig boards fast makes for faster rollouts
 MSmits: yeah, that does make sense
 MSmits: and you also avoid giving free moves when you win, if there is a non-free move win available
 MSmits: that i know
 karliso: yeah, and if multiplesafe wins I pick lowest... I think I tried to randomize way back, but it didn't give anything
 Or64bit: Hey guys
 Or64bit: Anyone up that knows something about DNS stuff? I'd have a pretty simple question that I do not know the answer for
 Andriamanitra: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dontasktoask.com/">https://dontasktoask.com/</a>
 Or64bit: I'll keep that in mind :D
 Or64bit: so why could it happen, that I cannot connect to webpages ending with .hu (My country's ending thing) but I can connect to .com sites?
 Andriamanitra: what do you mean by cannot connect? your browser doesn't load those web pages? have you tried getting the ip manually from command line?
 Or64bit: To be honest this is just a question I'd have to answer, the only extra info I know is that the page is not responding when I try to visit it
 Or64bit: but .com sites do load
 Or64bit: and also most of the pages that are on my university's network
 Or64bit: only .hu endings don'T
 Andriamanitra: are you sure it's ALL .hu sites? and is there any way you could verify it's not a problem with your browser (maybe try `curl google.hu`)?
 Andriamanitra: if it's not a problem with your browser it could be a dns problem or a firewall
 Uljahn: or hosts file
 Or64bit: Sadly I cannot verify, though you're right, it only states I cannot connect to to like five other specific we services
 Or64bit: but it also does not say that it could connect to other ones
 Or64bit: Here's the quetion translated, I hope you guys will understand it
 Or64bit: Between two lectures you decide on visiting something.hu, but the page does not respond. You'd like to figure out what's going on. Doing so you notice, that you also cannot reach a.hu b.hu c.hu and d.hu, altough you can open facebook, gmail, youtube, and also most of the university's sites load in. What do you think the problem could be?
 Uljahn: i guess, there is no valid dns record for them or those sites are offline or blocked by ISP

 Laserbeak43: In Power of Thor - Episode 1, you have to change Thor's position, but the only variables for Thor are intialTx and initialTY. Do I use those?
 struct: you can use those
 struct: but you need to update them
 jacek: you need to calculate thor's current position by yourself
 Laserbeak43: Thanks
 struct: Boss even has comments, depth 3 minimax
 jacek: what boss
 struct: C4
 jacek: and you can download it
 struct: oh 
 struct: Did not even notice it
 darkhorse64: 17 moves win against the boss
 darkhorse64: C4 is ready
 darkhorse64: for approval
 jacek: MSmits should approve it. he used most cpu power for it
 reCurse: Ready for detonation?
 darkhorse64: :smiley:
 MSmits: i did do 1.5 million games in meta mcts :0

 MSmits: i'll go approve
 reCurse: Not touching that one with a ten foot pole
 Andriamanitra: i'm getting captchas between each clash again&#160;:(

 MSmits: keep going jacek
 jacek: do you have :soccer: timer as well?
 MSmits: yea it's at 13 seconds because you just talked about it
 jacek: about what
 MSmits: you're just trying to get me to talk about it too
 MSmits: lol i got random time out on first test of connect 4 code
 MSmits: spent a few minutes trying to find the bug
 MSmits: it was just one of those random timeouts cg has
 darkhorse64: The boss is having a hard time
 MSmits: yeah 
 jacek: its on?
 jacek: i didnt get notification
 MSmits: it's on!
 darkhorse64: join the party
 MSmits: happened 10 mins ago
 MSmits: thanks for leaving me the approve btw
 jacek: nah, ill just give random bot for now
 jacek: so the boss wont be lonely
 MSmits: didnt you already have a better one?
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: ill wait for more people. then ill mess with leaderboard :imp:
 MSmits: btw, as promised, wont counterbook anyone. So far have general book of 486 moves that doesnt really go beyond ply 5. That's after 1.5 million games 
 jacek: going for column 1 after all?
 MSmits: yeah based on results

 MSmits: closest to 50%
 MSmits: i doubt you will notice a difference if you start at 0
 MSmits: because it didnt go below 50% until after hundreds of thousands of games
 MSmits: and you're only playing one game at a time so..
 MSmits: just dont start with 3 or 4... that would be bad for your winrate
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: there's another league
 MSmits: I was thinking, where did the tric go?
 Scarfield: you need to trac him down
 MSmits: :grin:
 Astrobytes: lmao
 MSmits: well at least the boss is better than random
 MSmits: it has jacek's random bot beat easily
 MSmits: nice to have a reasonable bar of entry to wood 1
 Scarfield: elStructo mentioned a depth 3 minmax boss
 MSmits: ah yeah thats a good strength to aim for I think
 Laserbeak43: "Timeout: your program did not provide an input in due time. Earth was destroyed!" Provide an input? I thought I was supposed to write to console
 MSmits: please don't destroy Earth before I get nr 1 at uttt
 jacek: yes, you write to console
 jacek: but did you print more than neccessary? or less?
 Laserbeak43: just made a big if/else
 Laserbeak43: that always sets a string variable to one of the directions which is output by Console.WriteLine() on line 60
 jacek: really? can you show the code
 Laserbeak43: and why do I not see this channel on the discord server?
 struct: maybe you have an infinite loop?
 reCurse: I might just keep an overfit bot to spam submit in spite
 jacek: i bet you have Console.WriteLine() in one if
 jacek: and it doesnt print
 MSmits: overfit to whom?
 MSmits: reCurse?
 reCurse: To perform better against you than everyone else when you get rank 1
 MSmits: mmmh
 jacek: hmph
 MSmits: do it&#160;:)

 MSmits: is this thor 1?
 struct: Also you need to update coords
 MSmits: the basic thor?
 MSmits: I thought my first C# solution was big, but this is even bigger
 MSmits: I like it
 Laserbeak43: update my coords?
 MSmits: when you output
 MSmits: you move to new coords
 Laserbeak43: initialx and initialy?
 MSmits: you need to remember them (= update)
 MSmits: yes change those, or use a different variable
 MSmits: so when you move to the right you do initialx++
 MSmits: for example
 Laserbeak43: was wondering if the code I don't see handles that or not
 MSmits: initialx is never changed
 MSmits: so no
 Laserbeak43: yeah i did that "initially"&#160;:) but removed it
 Laserbeak43: what what?
 MSmits: a single iteration of the while loop corresponds to a single step
 Laserbeak43: i get that
 Laserbeak43: but
 MSmits: your initialx and y are set before the while loop
 MSmits: and never change
 struct: Only stuff inside the while loop get updated every turn
 MSmits: unless you do it
 Laserbeak43: exactly
 Laserbeak43: but you said no?
 MSmits: i said you current code doesnt
 MSmits: but it should
 Laserbeak43: ah
 Laserbeak43: ok
 MSmits: sorry confusion
 Laserbeak43: np np thanks for the help
 MSmits: np
 Scarfield: i just looked up my python solution for thor, good laugh xD
 MSmits: it's good for your confidence when you look at those old solutions
 MSmits: wow, i learned a lot...
 Laserbeak43: lol.... I really want to be doing scala
 Laserbeak43: but I'll try them both
 Laserbeak43: yeah I know there's gotta be a more elegant way to do this, just being lazy I guess
 MSmits: connect4 seems to be really rare on draws
 Scarfield: yea it was probably the first puzzle i made after onboarding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Whoo hOooo!
 darkhorse64: fierce competitors do not accept draws
 MSmits: happy Patrick incoming
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lvl 35!  ;) :P
 Scarfield: Patricks day?
 MSmits: grats&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I should be ashamed, no contributions
 PatrickMcGinnisII: heh
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: but all in all i think CG has quite a lot of them already
 MSmits: testers are more needed than contributors
 MSmits: 10&#160;: 1 win ratio&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: xp is getting harder to come by
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fewer competitions
 MSmits: still plenty of multis you havent tried i'm sure
 MSmits: I found a draw! <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/530096589">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/530096589</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only connect 4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, of course i haven't gone "all out" on some of them
 MSmits: wait, you tried every other multi?
 MSmits: the xp is in the legend promotion
 MSmits: isnt it like 500&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, promotions are a b*tch
 darkhorse64: it is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: achievments give a little xp, but i have to do more langs
 darkhorse64: languages gives many achievements but few points
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i should make a puzzle, prolly easier xp
 MSmits: only make a puzzle if you have a good idea fo rit
 darkhorse64: no fibonacci in it
 MSmits: you dont like fibonacci?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: last puzzle i did was fib...centrifuge tuning, rofl
 darkhorse64: There are too many of them in Coc
 MSmits: ah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: coc isn't my jam
 Laserbeak43: So I've updated the coordinates. and  still the same error though.
 Laserbeak43: Expected a movement (one of N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) but found <i></i>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 4 people in connect4, ...o k a y...must be super new
 MSmits: share the code again, sounds like an output problem
 MSmits: yes PatrickMcGinnisII &lt; 1 hr
 struct: maybe it doesnt enter any if
 darkhorse64: do your ifs cover all cases&#160;? I would say probably no
 Laserbeak43: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/f5Ps9QWm">https://pastebin.com/f5Ps9QWm</a>
 MSmits: you're supposed to compare against light x
 MSmits: and forget everything else
 MSmits: so check if your x &gt; light x or x &lt; light x to determine if E or W is necessary
 MSmits: those if statements contain a lot of unnecessary comparisons
 Laserbeak43: so lighty never changes?
 Laserbeak43: trick question?
 MSmits: light is stationary
 Laserbeak43: for some reason I thought i had to chase it
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: x and y are both stationary
 MSmits: your thor moves
 MSmits: lightx and y i mean
 Laserbeak43: either way, what I've done in regard to comparison should break the code?
 MSmits: it's a bit hard to tell, if your bot doesnt output anything it means none of the if statements are true
 MSmits: if you simplify them it should be easier to fix
 MSmits: thats a better path than trying to figure out why this one doesnt work
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Laserbeak43 the move is null because you haven't met the criteria in all the if statements to change it
 Laserbeak43: hmm...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if you setup a deltax and deltay before the loop
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you will have better luck
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and since the Y direction always comes first in the move output
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can just move=N or S
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then test the x, and move=move+ W or E
 PatrickMcGinnisII: instead of 8 ifs you can reduce it to 4
 Laserbeak43: ok thanks. I'll try it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so, if deltay!=0 move+= N or S
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if deltax!=0 move+= W or E
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you'll get it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I gotta clean my house, cookin' steak for the gf in a few hours
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you had two of these:  (xy[0]&gt;lightX) &amp;&amp; (xy[1]==lightY)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: should be a &lt;
 Laserbeak43: changed the whole code block to this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eebe59b1-b8b7-470e-802b-8057e07a94b9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eebe59b1-b8b7-470e-802b-8057e07a94b9</a>
 Laserbeak43: oops
 Laserbeak43: sorry
 Laserbeak43: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ac4a7a64-3cae-49d3-bb73-ed8b204bd15c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ac4a7a64-3cae-49d3-bb73-ed8b204bd15c</a>
 Laserbeak43: ok i can't copy and paste code from the editor into chat
 Laserbeak43: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/VZ9Gd1YE">https://pastebin.com/VZ9Gd1YE</a>
 Laserbeak43: oh no i see what was happening.. lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: remember you are appending a character to the move string
 Laserbeak43: hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, u found it
 Laserbeak43: I was wondering. I don't see why I would append a direction to move?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do y first as its the first direction to be output
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so
 PatrickMcGinnisII: move="";
 Laserbeak43: 0 +"E"?
 Laserbeak43: no...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if (deltay!=0) { if (deltay&lt;0) { move+="N'; deltay++;} else {}  kinda thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I dunno what lang, what is it? c++?
 tridvajedan: how to make a puzzle
 tridvajedan: like a code puxxle
 tridvajedan: and upload it
 jacek: contributions
 Laserbeak43: C#
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so strcat(move,"N");   ?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: move.push_back("N");&#160;?
 Laserbeak43: I believe move "x" + "y";
 Laserbeak43: or move += "Y";
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so move+="N"; should be fine
 Laserbeak43: should work
 Laserbeak43: i feel like im being stubborn about something...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, i get mixed up between JS and java therre for a sec
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, oh works the same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unless you are using stringbuilder
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, i'm done giving advice, second guessing myself
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly should have said "S"
 Laserbeak43: hehe thanks...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: your original code would have worked with 2 minor changes.... the &lt; and tx++ .... but there is alot of unnecessary conditions in the statements
 Laserbeak43: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d16474af-4d49-4f6e-b76c-dcdfd0ffece7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d16474af-4d49-4f6e-b76c-dcdfd0ffece7</a>
 Laserbeak43: that worked...  for straight line
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you can always ctrl+z, to undo things
 Laserbeak43: think i'm just going to do it this way, since I don't know how the blackbox works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: remember do Y first
 jacek: y
 PatrickMcGinnisII: y&#160;!
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or is it   ~y
 Laserbeak43: :cold_sweat:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: stupid tilde doesn't show up in chat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: '/u223c
 PatrickMcGinnisII: grrr
 jacek: maybe the site is made in php
 struct: its due to your font
 AbundantPuddle: ỹ
 Laserbeak43: `
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the tilde in html might think it's a css operator
 PatrickMcGinnisII: U+007E
 PatrickMcGinnisII: grrr
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ~
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alt+0126\
 PatrickMcGinnisII: grr
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i give up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 AbundantPuddle: I don't know if you'rer referring to your text that says "or is it   ~y," but I can see the tilde there.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ahh ok, i can't
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all i see is -
 AbundantPuddle: Then as struct stated, it's probably due to your font.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or a longer -
 struct: -~
 PatrickMcGinnisII: prolly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok struct, you win
 AbundantPuddle: struct just did a dash and a tilde
 PatrickMcGinnisII: winner winner :poultry_leg: dinner
 AbundantPuddle: Lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all i see is a long dash
 jacek: rainbow dash?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &amp;#126
 PatrickMcGinnisII: grr
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 Laserbeak43: Thanks. Later

 Laserbeak43: i'm not understanding something about the flow of the program... this always stops 1 coordinate short of 1...
 Laserbeak43: of Y*
 struct: Laserbeak43
 struct: on the last if
 struct: line 62
 struct: will just append text
 struct: with your current code it can match one previous if
 struct: and then match that if
 Laserbeak43: @struct Thanks. Not exactly sure what you mean, but I'll focus on that block
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/GgDjja4.png">https://i.imgur.com/GgDjja4.png</a>
 jacek: oO
 arhariss: Hallow
 Andriamanitra: fuck these shit clashes with only 4 test cases :rage:
 jacek: reverse?
 Andriamanitra: shortest
 Andriamanitra: i saved one character too many
 MSmits: tihs clashes
 Andriamanitra: i had 43 (44 without the bug) and the next person had 95
 MSmits: sucks =/
 MSmits: so it worked on all the testcases but not on the validators/
 MSmits:&#160;?
 Andriamanitra: yup
 MSmits: that's annoying indeed
 Laserbeak43: @struct I've fixed that before (and now), and in my current code I am trying to figure out how to get ThorY to equal lightY when deltaY == lightY.  he always goes past the bounds
 struct: Whats your current code?

 Wontonimo: Laserbeak43 I was just told last week you don't need to put the @ infront of the name.  just passing along this wealth of knowledge 
 struct: laser
 Laserbeak43: Wontonimo thanks
 struct: you should use else if
 Laserbeak43: hmm
 Laserbeak43: ok i'll try that
 struct:  if(deltaY &lt; lightY){...}elseif(deltaY &gt; lightY){...}elseif((deltaY == lightY){....}
 struct: Something like that
 struct: the last elseif can be just an else
 Laserbeak43: struct omg...that's all i needed to fix it
 Laserbeak43: i really need to learn program flow...
 struct: check other players code
 Laserbeak43: yeah I'm feeling a bit silly
 Laserbeak43: thanks for the help
 Laserbeak43: Going to try doing it in Scala now
 struct: The logic is the same
 Stormalix: is there any way to stop all of the captchas im getting.. its really annoying and ive already done like  20 of them
 jtsimmons: Is there an easy way to see old clashes after you close out?
 brandex123: Is there a way to check out the test outputs of old clahes after you close out?
 Wontonimo: @Stormalix i think that's been raised as a bug in discord
 RyanGilbert: yeah if you do too many clashes in a row it gets sussy of you
 jtsimmons: Not a bot, just have nothing better to do.
 Wontonimo: do some puzzles

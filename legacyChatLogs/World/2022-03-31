 Synergyforge: Holy crap I just learned about the all() function.  Thanks! :D
 Dren: if all(&lt;expression&gt; for element in iterable): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ad9102cb-bafc-49b7-a0d8-4116104e6a6a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ad9102cb-bafc-49b7-a0d8-4116104e6a6a</a>
 Dren: the pair of this you might want to use is any()
 Dren: which of course returns true if any elements are true
 Synergyforge: No I need both, so all() is correct.  Seems to work too.
 Synergyforge: Thanks a lot
 Synergyforge: Not really necessary but it really shortens my expression
 Dren: yeah I didn't think much of these two built-ins but I found a surprising amount of uses for them
 Dren: for streamlining control flow and validation

 tutubalin: when I find a CoC puzzle which is not good enough, how can i find it in Contributions base?
 tutubalin: convinient search doesn't help
 tutubalin: I mean, I played CoC. The puzzle was suboptimal: typos in statement, unclear statement, bad tests, etc.
 a-Rye: I'm still pretty new, but from what I understand it's best to comment those things at the end of the clash in the feedback section. However, I do know there is a way to view a detailed page for each clash. I you figure it out, I would like to know as well!
 e_fishel: you can use the herokuapp

 Westicles: nobody reads feedback, just downvote and the moderation bot will delete it eventually
 Westicles: not downvote, but low rating
 tutubalin: e_fishel thanks! i'll take a look!
 MJ_said_hehe: Hey folks, cerr ain't pringintg anything
 MJ_said_hehe: *printing
 MJ_said_hehe: my bad it was something else
 e_fishel: my pleasure!
 tutubalin: oh, thank you!i found that my solution failed on 50% of validators due to my own error&#160;:)))
 e_fishel: oof, tough
 tutubalin: but another player's solution with a definiite mistake passed 100%
 tutubalin: so i think tests can be improved ^^
 e_fishel: report it for being inconsistent and badly constructed test cases
 e_fishel: ig
 CoolandonRS: Two quick questions about the stub generator:Is there a way to have a loop with an unknown number of repeats?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey CoolandonRS, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 CoolandonRS: And what is length for word and string?
 CoolandonRS: Oh figured out length, thought it was more complex then that lol
 CoolandonRS: And even better, I don't think I need that loop since I found a better way to do what I needed
 Uljahn: you are welcome! :thumbsup:
 SilverEagle: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Mortis_666: huntdown taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Cant find anyone with enough tacos
 Ajaiy: shakedown Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] Automaton2000 needs at least 50 :taco:s to do a shakedown
 Automaton2000: just pick a random one
 Automaton2000: depends how you use it to see the game
 Ajaiy: how was that message so perfect
 SilverEagle: shakedown Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] you need at least 3 :taco:s to do a shakedown
 Automaton2000: is it possible to have a hard time to find a way to see the code

 Uljahn: i'll DM you
 Tryst: take :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 eulerscheZahl: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. eulerscheZahl now has 32 taco
 Automaton2000: why do you have value based nn?
 Automaton2000: i don't know who you are talking about
 eulerscheZahl: shakedown Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] Using your superior Strength of 4 you shake 10 :taco:s off of Automaton2000.  9 fall on the floor, 1 got crushed, and you lost 1
 eulerscheZahl: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry eulerscheZahl but you have to give someone else a turn
 Automaton2000: you can use it as a puzzle
 Automaton2000: you lose 3, but can gain 10.
 eulerscheZahl: mine was the last turn?&#160;:(
 Frankich: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Frankich has taken 5 :taco:s off the floor and now has 9.  There are 4 left
 eulerscheZahl: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has taken 2 :taco:s off the floor and now has 34.  There are 2 left
 Fasader: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Fasader has taken 2 :taco:s off the floor and now has 3.  There are 0 left
 Fasader: what!? Since when did I have a taco?
 Fasader: foul sorcery!
 eulerscheZahl: you can also give tacos to others
 eulerscheZahl: and you even earn a taco yourself by sharing
 eulerscheZahl: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl has eaten 10 :taco: and your Strength is now 5.  You have 24 left
 ycsvenom: Hello
 ycsvenom: any cpp experts here?
 Tryst: take :taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Tryst: take :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 Wontonimo: you can get tacos by someone giving them to you, logging in when it's been quiet for 30 min or more, or after someone has shakendown a taco holder and tacos are on the floor
 Wontonimo: 60 min, not 30 min
 Wontonimo: :taco: Tryst
 antiwonto: [auto] Wontonimo has awarded Tryst 2 tacos. Tryst now has 3 taco. Wontonimo now has 39 taco
 SamirPS: Hello all
 SamirPS: how are you
 ycsvenom: good
 Wontonimo: good good.
 KalamariKing: tired, hbu
 Wontonimo: eulerscheZahl , shakedown now counts as a 'take taco' event
 antiwonto: [auto] eulerscheZahl needs at least 50 :taco:s to do a shakedown
 NewCoder09: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 ycsvenom: how i can check how many tacos i have?
 Wontonimo: it's part of anti-mining eulerscheZahl.  Looking at the chat history it looks like giving then shake down was just being used to farm tacos for an individual instead of it being a social thing.
 Wontonimo: you can give me tacos&#160;;) and then the system will tell you
 Mortis_666: eat taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Mortis_666 has eaten 10 :taco: and your Charm is now 2.  You have 25 left
 Wontonimo: or that
 Ajaiy: I have been trying to solve Roller Coaster for the past 2-3 weeks and it always fails the last 1-2 cases due to timeout. Is there a way to optimize the code to reduce the time?
 eulerscheZahl: no tacos for you, you can give them to yourself
 Bedstorm: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take
 eulerscheZahl: feature request: place a "trap". when a user writes a specific word, a shakedown will be applied on that user
 Wontonimo: yes Ajaiy, definitely a way to optimize
 eulerscheZahl: only works once, then you have to place a new trap
 Ajaiy: Can you tell what it is then?
 eulerscheZahl: use javascript, then the naive way works
 Wontonimo: oh, nice.  i think i get it eulerscheZahl but send me an example please
 eulerscheZahl: not even kidding, JS has more execution time
 NewCoder09: Wontonimo it took some deciding and I switched to Javascript
 Ajaiy: Is there an ACTUAL way to optimize it other than rewriting it in other languages?
 Wontonimo: hey Ajaiy, if rewriting in JS isn't your thing, then consider this 
 eulerscheZahl: userA: "trap randomWord"userB: "let's talk about randomWord"antiwonto: shakes down userB, removes trap on randomWord
 SaikoBlvckk: chu penm ela corn eta
 eulerscheZahl: English please
 Ajaiy: Wontonimo: consider what
 Wontonimo: if you have to add twenty 7s together ... would you use a loop?
 Ajaiy: no
 Mortis_666: nice idea
 Wontonimo: or just multiply
 Ajaiy: I would use Enumerable.Repeat
 Ajaiy: c#
 eulerscheZahl: 20*7?
 Wontonimo: so identify where you can replace a loop with a multiply in the roller coaster 
 eulerscheZahl: i consider C# as my primary language, can't remember using Enumerable.Repeat
 Ajaiy: But the problem is that you need to stop when all people get on the ride
 eulerscheZahl: i use Enumerable.Range sometimes
 Wontonimo: do this&#160;: 7*20instead of this&#160;: for _ in range(20)&#160;: total += 7
 Frankich: Never used Repeat either
 ycsvenom: is Shenzhen i/o puzzle gone?
 Wontonimo: Ajaiy, find where a loop starts and stops.  Everything before and after, make a special to calculate normally.  Everything in the repeating loop use a multiply
 SaikoBlvckk: this is a chilean language, native of chile
 Ajaiy: I can't do that though, as it won't calculate properly since gaps are left in the rollercoaster
 SaikoBlvckk: chant aunp eoen lat ula
 Wontonimo: it will if you identify repeating loops Ajaiy.  That is my solution and it calculates all test cases in less than 5ms
 Ajaiy: Mhm
 Ajaiy: will see
 Frankich: ycsvenom no it's just not a event anymore
 ycsvenom: Frankich where i can see it?
 eulerscheZahl: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/mcxxxx-microcontroller-simulation">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/mcxxxx-microcontroller-simulation</a>

 Wontonimo: How's learning JS going NewCoder09&#160;?
 NewCoder09: pretty good
 NewCoder09: right now I'm working on "mars lander" using Javascrit
 NewCoder09: Javascripy*
 NewCoder09: JS*
 Wontonimo: oh cool!
 Wontonimo: which version 
 NewCoder09: Episode 1
 Wontonimo: can i give you a hint?
 NewCoder09: sure
 Wontonimo: if the max safe landing speed is 40m/s , then only use thrust when your downward velocity is close to that ... say 35m/s
 Wontonimo: that's it.  no other logic at all
 NewCoder09: ok thank you
 Wontonimo: the trick with episode 1 is that there is SOO MUCH info, that it's challenging to identify the key part that is important.
 NewCoder09: ok
 Wontonimo: good trap concept eulerscheZahl .  As a minimum it should exclude bad words and user names
 NewCoder09: Wontonimo I might use Java and JS
 Tryst: After python what should I learn
 Wontonimo: cool, multilingual 
 Wontonimo: data structures and algorithms Tryst
 Wontonimo: go deep, not shallow and wide
 Tryst: I meant wot language
 Tryst: but thanks
 Wontonimo: don't.  Really dig into algorithms.
 Tryst: but i want to learn a diff language
 Tryst: i feel like python is so 
 Tryst: lazy
 Tryst: and the easiest language
 NewCoder09: yeah it kinda is
 Tryst: it does have the shortest possible hello world script
 Tryst: just
 Tryst: print("Hello world!"
 Tryst: )
 Wontonimo: have you implemented minimax , or a genetic algorithm yet?
 NewCoder09: I'd say if you want to learn something hard go for C++
 Tryst: no im still a beginner
 Wontonimo: or implemented A* search?
 NewCoder09: or something in between go with Javascript
 NewCoder09: I started with C++ 
 Tryst: i dont want to go so deep on something that im not even gonna enjoy
 Tryst: JavaScript it is
 Wontonimo: yeah, it is good to use an easy language to practice hard concepts
 Wontonimo: i highly recommend javascript because of the fun you can have with making mini web games , like this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/">http://panchishin.github.io/roguer_path/</a>
 Wontonimo: which i made with just plain-old javascript
 NewCoder09: You made that?
 Tryst: this game is so simple yet so addicting
 Ajaiy: lol it looks like labyrinth
 Ajaiy: from CodinGame
 Wontonimo: thanks Tryst&#160;:) 
 Tryst: no problem wontonimo&#160;:)
 NewCoder09: I couldn't get Mars lander so I did ASCII Art 
 Ajaiy: It felt like beating a world record when I finally finished Mars Lander 2
 Ajaiy: and there is Mars Lander 3
 NewCoder09: I know
 Ajaiy: Wontonimo: Converting the 2-layer loop to a while loop made the performance even slow. I have no idea what to do now
 KalamariKing: check if youre losing performance somewhere else
 Ajaiy: I think the loop being a while loop made it slower than a 2-layered for loop
 Ajaiy: but I'm not very sure
 Wontonimo: i don't have a loop in my solution Ajaiy
 Wontonimo: or a while
 KalamariKing: my man really likes his loops
 Wontonimo: (which is a loop)
 Ajaiy: really?
 Wontonimo: Ajaiy , Roller coaster is "hard".   Usually hard puzzles cannot be solved using brute force.  The solution has to be more 'elegant'
 Ajaiy: But i'm not even brute-forcing
 Ajaiy: I just used queues like a normal person
 Wontonimo: oh, i'm wrong.  i'm looking at my solution now.  i remember wrong.  there is a loop.
 Ajaiy: oh
 Ajaiy: a for, i guess&gt;
 Ajaiy:&#160;?
 Wontonimo: while (c &lt; C) {
 Wontonimo: C = cycles per day.
 Wontonimo: oh, and i have another while loop in there ... lol.  
 Ajaiy: but I also used the EXACT SAME THING! only 1 while though
 Ajaiy: while(C &gt; 0)
 Wontonimo: my code completes the last test case in 0.69 ms using c++
 Ajaiy: I use c# though
 Wontonimo: shouldn't make a difference
 Ajaiy: So you basically used the obvious "ride simulation" technique with two while loops and it executes at 0.69 ms?
 Wontonimo: no, before moving onto the next simulation I check if I have found a  repeating pattern and if so then just use multiply
 Ajaiy: i knew it
 Wontonimo: long cycleLength = c - hit[queueStart];long repeats = (C - c)/cycleLength;
 Ajaiy: ohhhh i see
 Ajaiy: So you just need memoization
 Wontonimo:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: sorry for remembering wrong and leading you astray before
 Synergyforge: Cool var names.
 Synergyforge: C, c...  XD

 coddednight: hello anyone on
 NewCoder09: So guys I made an overload for a school website right 
 Synergyforge: That sounds illegal.&#160;:)
 CodingLegendDaniel: Help, I'm really bad at coding, how do I do better?
 NewCoder09: I showed some people, so they started using it, and since they didn't know how to it they got the whole website blocked o school computers
 NewCoder09: Synergyforge not really
 Synergyforge: Define "overload"
 NewCoder09: shut up 
 Synergyforge: ...
 NewCoder09: shut up 
 CodingLegendDaniel: O_O
 NewCoder09: ok fine it may be 
 Synergyforge: Welp, blocking the nine year old
 NewCoder09: but were not talking about that 
 NewCoder09: me?
 Uljahn: NewCoder09: first warning, watch your language
 NewCoder09: oh yeah sorry
 Wontonimo: you were given a warning yesterday also NewCoder09
 NewCoder09: yeah I know :sweat_smile:

 coddednight: can someone help me with mad pod racing
 Wontonimo: yes! I can
 Ajaiy: you can directly ask the question
 Wontonimo: how far are you?
 NewCoder09: Wontonimo are you just in love with AI coding?
 NewCoder09: I mean it's really fun so I mean I love it too
 Ajaiy: NewCoder: What makes you assume so?
 NewCoder09: it wasn't assuming its a question 
 Ajaiy: ok
 NewCoder09: if it was assuming I would've said "You love AI coding"
 Ajaiy: But it looks like Wontonimo is equally eager in answering all questions
 NewCoder09: Yes I know but it was a direct question
 NewCoder09: I was just asking because I've never learned what his favorite subject was
 Wontonimo: I do love AI coding :grin: , you know me pretty well NewCoder09 , it's like all those hours we've been chatting on DM are showing
 NewCoder09: I know :smile:
 NewCoder09: you got me into it
 Ajaiy: :smile: Wow, that was an accurate guess
 _Lupus_: Has anyone here done "Ocean of Code" and can tell me in which order the orders are performed? In a fixed one (e.g. Torpedo before Move) or in the order they were given?
 NewCoder09: I haven't sorry
 Wontonimo: coddednight , where are you with mad pod racing&#160;?  have you at least finished the tutorial and figured out that you need to target  x,y instead of y,y
 Yotic: there are no abbreviated files in Net 6.0 for C#&#160;;( in terms of symbols, it’s generally possible to overtake some pythonist, but why am I silent about ruby and pearl...
 derjack: mhm
 Wontonimo: that was random
 derjack: Automaton2000 was it?
 Automaton2000: that might have been a good idea to time things with it with repeated clock() calls.
 blasterpoard: _Lupus_ if you're still here, in OoC orders are performed in the order in which they were given
 _Lupus_: Thank you blasterpoard :thumbsup: meanwhile I noticed that it is (very subtly) written in the description in one of the examples
 Tryst: what's the difficulty of the "go" coding language
 NewCoder09: I                 think                     it's                           pretty                  decent                          .
 Tryst: mk
 Tryst: i just like the name and how similar it is to java
 jacek: write go bot in go
 NewCoder09: You shouldn't like things for the name, you should like them for how they work   
 Tryst: I know I don't like it only for the name
 NewCoder09: OK
 Tryst: I personally mainly like it because of its similarity to both Java and JavaScript
 NewCoder09: Ok 
 jacek: java and javascript have common name
 jacek: :v
 Synergyforge: Java is nothing like javascript :P
 Tryst: Synergyforge they are kinda similar just javascript is less typing
 eson12: New to programming. Where would you guys recommend I start?
 Tryst: are you brand new or have a little bit of experience
 eson12: little bit of experience
 Synergyforge: Java and Javascript are for entirely different uses, and until recently, Javascript wasnt OO.
 Tryst: what language do you want to learn currently
 eson12: currently trying to learn python 
 Tryst: Synergyforge I do get that they are for entirely different purposes but they still have relatively the same commands in order to print somethingLike System.out.printIn("Hello World!)
 Tryst: anyways
 Tryst: You should get started with loops, functions, and arrays
 Tryst: since that's what this website requires 
 eson12: got it 
 eson12: Thank you!
 Tryst: No problem!

 Wontonimo: hey coddednight , looking at your games and at other peoples games is very insightful.  There is a gear button on the playback that allows you to turn on debug
 Wontonimo: debug lets you see where the opponents are aiming!  Check out the silver league, look at some replays, and try to reverse out what they are doing by looking at where their pod is pointing

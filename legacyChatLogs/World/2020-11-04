 Khadija007: Hi
 TBali: AutomatonNN, Who will win the Fall Challenge 2020?
 AutomatonNN: I don't like the time to be able to program in 1 month
 TBali: Automaton2000, and what do you think?
 Automaton2000: when you write the code in a way that makes sense
 TBali: AutomatonNN, who gave more nonsense answer, you or Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: you can just write a ga for mars lander 1
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a company ready for a linux in UTTT&#160;?
 TBali: You both have some more stuff to learn...
 Nuggest: what do I do when the validator gives me an error after submit?
 Illedan: Reflect on life and try to figure out what edge case you didn't cover
 Illedan: If that doesn't work, check the Forum on that puzzle. Se if you find a hint in other questions
 Nuggest: It's code vs zombies, it says Rectangle. How am I supposed to know what goes wrong?
 Illedan: Do you pass all testcases?
 Nuggest: yes
 Illedan: Do you use a timer in your code? Is it close to the limit?
 Nuggest: No
 Illedan: Where do it say Rectangle?
 Nuggest: After submitting, the testcase "Rectangle" is red
 Illedan: Can you share a replay of your bot playing the testcase Rectangle?
 Nuggest: I'm totally now to this site. How do I do that?
 Nuggest: new*
 Illedan: Play it in the IDE
 Illedan: Then click the share button, far left right below the replay
 Illedan: Then wait for it to load and share the link

 jacek: linux in UTTT?
 Astrobytes: UTTTux

 eulerscheZahl: almost as thrilling as a CG contest recalc
 wlesavo: im waiting for a south park episode about elections
 Astrobytes: very close indeed
 jacek: time to spam resubmit
 Illedan: They should use CG recalc for the election. Just send the votes to CG
 wlesavo: pb is gonna make alternative recalc

 AntiSquid: 28 years to gain US citizenship and run for president eulerscheZahl
 AntiSquid: enough time, better not fuck it up

 dbdr: need a time machine to be born in the US. foreigner cannot become US president
 AntiSquid: i don't like biden at all after the laptop of hell surfaced, but think of biden's condition and you'll know why all that matters is who is his vice president
 AntiSquid: and that law might change over time
 NitMpez: Any advice... it seems once I get a few arrows in the middle it is hard to get rid of them.  Also really favors those long runs instead of zig zagging... but not sure how to get that zig zag in:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/497416222">https://www.codingame.com/replay/497416222</a>
 AntiSquid: how many arrows do you remove and add at once?
 NitMpez: I randomly do that from 1 to 4
 NitMpez: i don't necessarily always remove either... i really just random 4 spots and based on the weight of that square decide if I should add or not add(remove) if an arrow is already there
 NitMpez: one thing i thought I might look at is maybe wiping arrows that don't get pathed, but i didn't do that cause i thought early sims might not path it, but later ones would make use of it
 NitMpez: hoping if I can fix this, it will push me out of low 9ks into upper 9ks/low 10ks
 NitMpez: getting around 160k sims on that map doing all the robots
 eulerscheZahl: NitMpez which testcase is that?
 NitMpez: 22
 NitMpez: I'm working on mapping my moves and going to try removing unpathed arrows to see if that helps

 eulerscheZahl: no hardcoding, found in 1s
 eulerscheZahl: in some lucky runs i think i got &gt;1000 in that testcase
 NitMpez: wow... yeah... i think luckiest i've seen running test cases is around 700
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/497423964">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/497423964</a>
 NitMpez: problem i see on mine... is i gen to many arrows in the middle and then it seems like the sim has trouble recovering from doing edges
 eulerscheZahl: then make it less likely for your algo to place an arrow there&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: and more likely to remove again
 eulerscheZahl: nope, i'm not even trolling here
 NitMpez: yeah i hear you... i think right now... my weight is, if it is a square with 4 adjacent blocks and 4 diag blocks i have a 20% chance to place an arrow there and 80% to remove
 NitMpez: wondering if i shouldn't do something where i keep a map of all my arrows placed... and have one that does my normal placement and one that randomly selects some placed arrows and either adjusts or removes or keeps
 eulerscheZahl: what are you doing right now?
 NitMpez: start with an empty map, randomly select 4 spots for arrows and based on the weight put an arrow there.. sim it and get score
 NitMpez: then if the score is better or within my delta and based on time left I will keep it as my current and random 4 more arrows
 NitMpez: only keep better scores towards the end of my sim
 eulerscheZahl: sounds fine
 eulerscheZahl: similar to what i do (i actually mutate less than 4 each time)
 NitMpez: I'm thinking I might need to sort my weighted valid spots... and come up with something to select the top half more often maybe
 NitMpez: right now it is a fairly even distribution across all valid spots for arrows
 eulerscheZahl: places near each other more often
 eulerscheZahl: local modifications
 NitMpez: oh that is a good idea, selecting arrows near each other
 NitMpez: ill work on trying that out, thanks for the ideas

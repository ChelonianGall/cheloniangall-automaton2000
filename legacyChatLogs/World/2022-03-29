 drnobody: can has taco?
 Synergyforge: Gah!  Why the hell does my loop work ONCE but then behaves as if the inputs were the same as the first iteration. &gt;:O
 Synergyforge: :rage:
 Synergyforge: &gt;&#160;: O isn't supposed to be :O
 Wontonimo: i tried early retirement.  After 8 months i got stir crazy and went back to work
 Apika: Taco
 Synergyforge: Why would you go stir crazy?  Just get a motorcycle. :D
 Husoski: "Stir crazy" is a bit of what I felt at telecommuting.  
 Synergyforge: You're not still?
 Husoski: Both...crazy and still stirring.
 Synergyforge: I meant telecommuting.  It's not over, you know.&#160;:)
 Synergyforge: I think office buildings shouldn't even exist.  We've proven we don't need them.  Hell, it would even save companies countless millions.
 Husoski: I never started the Covid round of telecommuting.
 Husoski: Maybe.  Takes a lot of electricity to stay in touch without being in person.  Don't know how that will play out with rising population and global climate change.
 Synergyforge: And what about operating skyscrapers that require constant power?
 Husoski: Like I said...I don't know.  I didn't work in a skyscraper, anyway.  Only one year doing (ugh) tax software on the 4th floor of a 9-story.
 Synergyforge: Yikes.  Sounds fun!
 Husoski: The most fun was a little place in So Cal that was making infrared spectrometers.  About 50 employees, total.  30 yards from CEO's office to the mfg/shipping door.  We designed, programmed, marketed, manufactured and shipped from one building.
 Husoski: ...and almost everyone played ping pong!
 SilverEagle: take taco
 SilverEagle: Tch!

 cagriy: hello from istanbul
 Stilgart: Congrats!You've reached level 52. \o/
 DaNinja: nice gg
 Passifi: Very Cool, just remember you will still never be good enough for your parents to truly love you :disappointed: 
 Stilgart: Automaton2000 loves me, so everything is fine
 Automaton2000: i only do that when you get to a higher league
 Stilgart:&#160;:)
 EleanorJ: I did a weeks worth of java study and now i have a job, help 
 EleanorJ: i messed around and found out
 5DN1L:&#160;???
 Passifi: Congrats that sounds like an awesome title for a book
 EleanorJ: does sound like a visual novel doesnt it
 Wontonimo: :taco: Everyone!
 Wontonimo:&#160;;(
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 5DN1L: Hi Wontonimo
 Passifi: Hola
 Wontonimo: Hi 5DN1L , it's been a while
 itzluku: wasabiiiiiiiii
 5DN1L: Yes indeed Wontonimo
 EleanorJ: If even the baby levels here are giving me a hard time do yall have any other online platforms similar to this you might recommend for someone who doesnt have a cs degree and is trying to learn as i go
 Wontonimo: what language are you trying EleanorJ&#160;?
 EleanorJ: Just java for now 
 EleanorJ: I've done some mooc.fi courses theyre good 
 Wontonimo: nice nice.  I coded Java for over 15 years
 5DN1L: if you're looking for puzzles you may try codewars EleanorJ
 itzluku: i can see beginner java programmers to struggle alot with all that string manipulation
 itzluku: so much easier in python imo
 Tryst: ^
 itzluku: @ElanorJ any goals with java - or why java?
 itzluku: did some spring boot stuff but other than that... rly never looked back to java
 EleanorJ: @itzluku well full disclosure I applied to a company that more or less just wants an aptitude test then train you the rest of the way for clients goals, java is what theyre wanting so java is what im studying
 EleanorJ: i did some R and python in college but that was years ago, so trying to get my mind back in that headspace yknow
 itzluku: yeh sounds good
 itzluku: idk if those type of coding challenges suite java that well tho
 EleanorJ: thanks for the recommendation @5DN1L ill check that one out
 EleanorJ: Yea i mean i figure ill get a repo of resources and kinda filter through them as i need 
 itzluku: do u know what type of java apps that company wants you to implement?
 EleanorJ: Not yet, my cohort is pretty diverse and I think I'm towards the  bottom in terms of knowledge so I'm just along for the ride at this point , they might know what sort of programs but I'm not sure yet
 itzluku: like: field/domain&#160;:: web/embedded/mobile/...
 itzluku: or what type of task
 itzluku: or issues
 Passifi: I mean if they claim to train you then they should probably be involved in this process&#160;;) I mean puzzles and all certainly helps but I found that for a specifi project learning the framework and libs needed for that is what gets you going the fastest, people always claim coding is coding but imho making a game is soo vastyl different from doing like business software you can't prepare for both in a short time&#160;:)
 EleanorJ: Yup, I'm *that* ignorant about it, we don't know which clients we apply to for another few weeks, and hey theres training, 8 hours a day im here before it starts because i know im slacking
 itzluku: so its more like: customer x needs y, do (automate?) that in java? 
 itzluku: hm
 EleanorJ: I just want to prep myself as best as I can because I hear team mates talking about lambda calculus and my eyes go sideways, I want to keep up and try not to embarrass myself amongst people who clearly have years of experience on me 
 EleanorJ: side bar im totally interrupting yall discord my bad haha , this is all ramblings that dont matter i appreciate everyones replies tho! 
 itzluku: i mean we all feel behind in different areas, that will always be like that :D
 itzluku: if u put in time, and dont act like u know more than u do.. then noone should be looking down on u
 itzluku: if u have experienced coworkers, there is sth to learn - better than being the best tbh
 itzluku: I agree with Passifi, best is prob learn lib-specific stuff for the task u will eventually do.. but since u dont know what that will be... kinda weird hm
 EleanorJ: Yea I think Passifi makes a great point and I know we'll get there, im only 1  day in past orientation so theres plenty ahead of me, I want to get ahead of it as best as possible since most of my peers seem to have either a comp sci bachelors or some other experience, maybe once were a few weeks in and i get a better sense of the tools i can come bug yall about it again
 itzluku: :P
 itzluku: in the starting phase it is expected that u will ask about alot of stuff - its more annoying if u ask that stuff later - so just put in the time especially at the start, get involved
 EleanorJ: Yea, I
 EleanorJ: i'm definitely gonna try to front load my questions no body wants to hear the same stuff 5 weeks in
 inoryy: EleanorJ don't stress too much over it, everyone starts from scratch at some point and I'm sure your teammates will keep that in mind. I know it's easy to say but I started out as a self-taught web dev and know exactly what "hear teammates talking about lambda calculus and eyes go sideways" feels like. It gets better, I promise!
 EleanorJ: Thank you all for the kind words &lt;3 ;__; I'm not cryin yr cryin
 KalamariKing: you're gonna do great
 KalamariKing: if you weren't qualified you wouldnt have made it this far
 EleanorJ: &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 thank you everyone , brb gonna go do my morning words of affirmation, todays gonna kick ass and im gonna learn SO much!

 coddednight: wym
 coddednight: can you guys help me btw
 KalamariKing: probably, whats up coddednight
 coddednight: so uh im on the mad pod racing and i kinda need help making the pods move
 KalamariKing: i see
 coddednight: also im on java
 5DN1L: You're in Wood 3 league now, right?
 coddednight: im not sure
 5DN1L: Check out the top left corner
 5DN1L: the league is stated there
 coddednight: yeah i am
 KalamariKing: I believe you provide a destination point, and a thrust amount
 KalamariKing: just print it
 coddednight: how
 KalamariKing: System.out.println(x, y, thrust);
 5DN1L: it's in the default code
 KalamariKing: where x, y, and thrust are ints
 coddednight: ok let me try thx
 5DN1L: coddednight in the Wood 3 league you just have to fix the code
 coddednight: ok
 5DN1L: you don't have to come up with new code
 KalamariKing: why did i do this in c++
 KalamariKing: what
 5DN1L: you can change the language
 KalamariKing: yeha
 KalamariKing: i dont remember doing this in cpp tho
 5DN1L: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure the onboarding starts by highlighting the language selection for you
 KalamariKing: yep
 Passifi: waa worked like three days on the grafitti on fences puzzle good to finally have solved but it always takes me down a peg when I struggle so much with an easy puzzle ...^^
 Passifi: last 20 min were about debugging and finding out that auto in a for loop doesn't return a reference.. the hard way&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: keep going. you'll be able to solve easy ones faster and solve others with higher effort that you've been unable to solve before
 Tryst: I learned a lot about loops in the past 2 years but when I'm attempting to do an easy puzzle focused on loops all of that knowledge goes poof
 Tryst: Which is why I'm still stuck on the Horse-racing puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: stuck as in: you fail the last testcase because of timeout?
 eulerscheZahl: or as in: you can't even solve the easier ones?
 Tryst: I fail the last testcase
 Tryst: first two im good
 eulerscheZahl: 2 nested loops is not the solution
 Tryst: hm
 eulerscheZahl: you do something with the input. and then you only compare direct neighbors and not each vs each

 PainEXE: My mad pod racing screen is frozen
 PainEXE: how do I fix it
 5DN1L: refresh
 5DN1L: try if that helps
 PainEXE: It just continues to freeze after 1 play
 PainEXE: Should I just refresh every single attempt?
 5DN1L: what do you mean by "continues to freeze after 1 play"?
 5DN1L: any error messages in the console?
 PainEXE: after pressing "play my code" it freezes at the end
 PainEXE: no error messages
 5DN1L: but if you refresh it, does it help?
 PainEXE: It does but for only 1 play
 5DN1L: weird
 5DN1L: i've never heard of this before&#160;:(
 PainEXE: maybe its my browser
 5DN1L: maybe, try another browser?
 PainEXE: ok on chrome It seems to be working
 PainEXE: wait nvm
 PainEXE: Yeah it just freezes midway through 
 PainEXE: with no console output
 5DN1L: not even 1 turn?
 PainEXE: Not even 1 turn
 5DN1L: let me try mine
 PainEXE: Imma stick to clash of code I guess
 VizGhar: what you mean by 1 play?
 5DN1L: mine works fine
 VizGhar: and what language?
 PainEXE: Im using python 3 and when i press the play buttomn or "play my code" it just freezes midway through before finishing
 PainEXE: button*
 5DN1L: no console output: did you choose some other console settings by accident?
 PainEXE: All three checkboxes are on
 PainEXE: I dont believe so
 5DN1L: ok
 5DN1L: but there has to be some output...
 5DN1L: any screenshot you can share?
 5DN1L: console in particular
 PainEXE: Also Im somehow top 4128/61746 in wood 2 league even though I havent seen th whole thing
 PainEXE: sure one sec
 5DN1L: if you're in wood 2 that means you've submitted some code to the arena before
 PainEXE: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/bWjKC17">https://ibb.co/bWjKC17</a>

 5DN1L: so clicking PLAY MY CODE generates no response at all?
 PainEXE: Nope
 PainEXE: Any issue with my code or something?
 N1cknAm]: cock

 VizGhar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/dpTkkgb">https://ibb.co/dpTkkgb</a> 5DN1L for me this is broken UX
 PainEXE: I hate it so much
 5DN1L: Thonny helps me debug
 VizGhar: on win and linux SUPER+left arrow and you are done :P
 5DN1L: so you mean you need some window tiling function?
 5DN1L: not sure if i understand u correctly
 VizGhar: I hate pricing, underapreciated workers. that fricking mouse and dead keyboard after year of normal using
 VizGhar: I want shortcut, so that active window is tilted do left

 5DN1L: maybe this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/401872/how-to-tile-windows-without-going-into-full-screen">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/401872/how-to-tile-windows-without-going-into-full-screen</a>
 5DN1L: i've never needed this feature myself :stuck_out_tongue:
 VizGhar: shame on me... yeah thats it... but why so complicated?
 VizGhar: you know what I hate most? If you want to delete something, you have to move it to bin :D
 5DN1L: there's shortcut for that
 5DN1L: command-delete
 5DN1L: i'll only admit this: mac os x isn't as well-designed as before. but overall i still like it
 VizGhar: ok, so I'm just full of hate and denier of everything mac related :D
 VizGhar: Well still better then windows
 5DN1L: that's for sure lol
 NewCoder09: 5DN1L look what i made for Vox Codei episode 1 I'm so proud of myself
 NewCoder09: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/7beVbJm">https://tech.io/snippet/7beVbJm</a>
 VizGhar: We have 3 computers each with different OS :P
 5DN1L: wow really long code there, NewCoder09
 VizGhar: NewCoder09 good for you&#160;:) but you shouldn't share your code. Some might copy it
 5DN1L: yeah
 5DN1L: congrats on passing the puzzle though
 5DN1L: good job
 NewCoder09: VizGhar it will be ok if they do because they wont ever be completely proud of them selves because the didn't make it 
 NewCoder09: 5DN1L, VisGhar I made a 630 line code for "Code VS Zombies" :sweat_smile:
 VizGhar: If you dont know how some of guys here are starving for achievements, just look at contributions page :D
 NewCoder09: yeah i know 
 VizGhar: 630 lines in python... it like 20.000 in C++ right? :D
 NewCoder09: I'm not sure
 NewCoder09: should i switch completely from C++ to Python and Javascript?
 VizGhar: let your heart guide you
 NewCoder09: I think I might 
 VizGhar:&#160;:) then you probably should... what you do for living?
 NewCoder09: I'm in 6th grade
 VizGhar: oh aha... If you are 6th grader and you already code in C++ woah
 VizGhar: So what would you like to do with coding... just get better I assume
 VizGhar: If you have good teacher stick with C++ until the point you completely understand how memory and processor works. Then you can experiment... but thats only my point of view
 VizGhar: many python devs have no idea what is really happening
 NewCoder09: uhh i mean when I get older I would be much better at coding so if I really wanted to I might be able to take it into a carrer
 NewCoder09: I'm self taught I don't take lessons
 NewCoder09: And then right now I am better than 10% of professionals in C++
 Sorrb: cap
 NewCoder09: cap about what?
 Sorrb: ur not better than pros
 NewCoder09: check my page i have it open
 Sorrb: 🤷‍♂️
 NewCoder09: check my page if you don't believe me
 Sorrb: whats ur page prove lol
 Sorrb: pros don't use this website
 Westicles: by the time you get out of grad school all code will be written by general purpose AI
 Sorrb: do you have any expierence making real software?
 VizGhar: NewCoder09 ignore him&#160;:) 6th grader coding in C++ is good enough for me
 Sorrb: howcome u did ONE puzzel in C and got top 225
 NewCoder09: bro not gonna lie yall can be messed up for not believing people 
 Sorrb: VizGhar i never said he is bad?
 Sorrb: Im just saying he isn't better than pros
 Sorrb: 🤷‍♂️
 NewCoder09: check my page 
 NewCoder09: thats really all i can say 
 Sorrb: Bro ur page proves nothing
 VizGhar: Ok another cycle, I'm out
 NewCoder09: ok this website keeps up with pros progress and when you take the IDE (made by professionals) when your done with it, it tells you your score and what&#160;% you're better than
 Sorrb: okay but have u made any real software?
 Sorrb: Whenever u have thats when u can begin to consider ur self a "pro"
 Sorrb: be humble
 NewCoder09: i never said I'm a pro
 Sorrb: "And then right now I am better than 10% of professionals in C++"
 NewCoder09: thats the thing, plus now your putting words in my mouth
 Sorrb: so what does that statement mean?
 Uljahn: actually it's pretty easy to get &gt;99% even for not a pro
 Sorrb: right
 NewCoder09: it shows how bad and good pros can be
 Sorrb: how can u be a "bad" "pro"
 Sorrb: what?
 Christian: :joy:
 Sorrb: if ur bad ur just not a pro
 Uljahn: the certification is a joke atm
 Synergyforge: Once you get into the industry, get hired by a big company, and realize nobody else has any idea what's going on either, you'll realize there are no pros.&#160;:)
 DavidBrumagin: :point_up:
 Synergyforge: We all just make it up as we go.
 Sorrb: what they're saying
 Sorrb: be humble about ur self
 Sorrb: Im sure you'll be something one day 🤷‍♂️
 Sorrb: just not today 😂
 VizGhar: That statement means 6th grader if flexing and you are &lt;something offensive&gt; enough to argue with him.&#160;:) can't you just support him to study?
 NewCoder09: I am I'm trying to get my self esteem back up to even try to stay alive right because coding is the only thing that makes me happy
 Sorrb: Im not putting him down 
 5DN1L: Sorrb let's not focus the discussion on any one person here, ok?
 NewCoder09: Ok whatever go along with your day and I'll go along with mine 
 Uljahn: if you want to test your skills you should participate in the upcoming contest
 Sorrb: OKaY bRo

 <b>**Sorrb slaps VizGhar around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/79633423380001" /> 5DN1L: NewCoder09 it's just one person's view
 5DN1L: Don't get upset
 Sorrb: I WAS never putting you down my man
 Sorrb: Sorry if it felt that way
 NewCoder09: yeah from your perspective you weren't but ok 
 Sorrb: Tbh
 Sorrb: if i was u i wouldn't listen to me
 Sorrb: 🤷‍♀️
 NewCoder09: still think before you act
 Sorrb: no
 DavidBrumagin: sometimes we forget what it was like to be young when we get older. You're way ahead of the curve for your age, just remember that.
 Sorrb: im only 8

 Emperxr: damn 
 Sorrb: Kidding 😒

 Sorrb: u ungrateful
 5DN1L: If you continue to repeat and flood the char, you'll be banned Sorrb
 ycsvenom: you are only sending repeated links

 ycsvenom: are you even a programmer!
 Not_Sorrb: yes i am

 Not_Sorrb: why else would i be here
 5DN1L: to be banned again perhaps?
 Not_Sorrb: actually
 Not_Sorrb: i used a sus email
 Not_Sorrb: so i don't mind

 ycsvenom: Darleannow
 Not_Sorrb: even if u do IP ban mei can switch houses :shrug:
 5DN1L: banned again
 5DN1L: hope i don't have to do it many times...
 Darleanow: ycsvenom , almost,in fact our professor is a dumbass, he made us dl mingw, without being in a virtual env and THEN told us to venv .env

 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/520869bc-6a2c-4da3-9d24-125b996811ae">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/520869bc-6a2c-4da3-9d24-125b996811ae</a>
 Wontonimo: ^^ that's an example of the stderr that i use for debugging
 Synergyforge: I like how it refers to your character as Rick and as Kirk.  lulul
 Wontonimo: it was all originally Kirk, and the name was something to do with Star Trek, but copyright 
 5DN1L: wow didn't know they changed the statement too
 Synergyforge: You can't copyright someone's name.  Anyway, it never mentions Star Trek, and it still mentions Spock.&#160;:)
 Synergyforge: Just put "No relation to any characters, real or imagined.&#160;:)"
 NewCoder09: alright I just got done with "MIME Type" I needed 7 more XP
 5DN1L: nice
 ycsvenom: noice
 Synergyforge: How do you decide what direction to start trending toward when making movements?  I started counting all the '?' characters and trying to move in the direction that most of them are located, and deciding at each turn which way to go based on direct surroundings.
 NewCoder09: 5DN1L should I switch from C++ to Javascript coompletely?
 5DN1L: I don't have any opinion on that. How about Wontonimo and others?
 Synergyforge: I remember when everybody hated Javascript because it was a slow, bloated mess.  And now, it's object oriented and everybody requires it.  XD
 NewCoder09: Wontonimo should switch from C++ to javascript completely?
 5DN1L: Synergyforge as far as I remember you should clear out all&#160;? initially
 5DN1L: so keep updating your grid
 5DN1L: and you should know where to go to before you reach the control room
 5DN1L: because once you reach the control room you don't have time to explore any more
 Synergyforge: right
 Synergyforge: but then you should have enough information to find the shortest path from the adjacency list you built along the way
 5DN1L: yup
 Synergyforge: I think I understand the basic concept, I'm just not practiced enough in these kinds of problems.&#160;:(
 5DN1L: then practise more :wink:
 Synergyforge: My last job held me back so much, I never learned what I need to know.
 Synergyforge: And I stayed in that dead-end waaaaay too long
 5DN1L: move on and move up!
 EleanorJ: is there a way to generate similar versions of puzzles , or just have to move on to a different one?
 5DN1L: what do you mean?
 5DN1L: which section are you asking about?
 Wontonimo: i was away for something ...NewCoder09 - javascript or c++ is fine.  just get good at one, that's the important thing
 EleanorJ: just curious if i could generate examples similar to the descent in terms of concept or its just that one example, not any particular example just all the practice modules
 EleanorJ: i dont think so, poking around more on the page just curious if anyone knew off hand
 Synergyforge: Seems like most of the challenges on this site are similar concepts to each other.  Like variations on a graph theme.,
 Wontonimo: Synergyforge - the problem statement includes "Breadth First SearchTwo dimensional arrayPathfindingA*" in the external resources
 5DN1L: if you want to practise certain concepts / algorithms, you may look for the tags and the related puzzles EleanorJ
 NewCoder09: Wontionimo I think I am going to use Javascript
 Westicles: javascript is a bear to port to c++.  an int turns into an array or array of arrays without warning
 Wontonimo: graph theory is key in advanced programming, and a huge topic
 EleanorJ: gotcha thanks all 
 Synergyforge: Wontonimo yeah I figured it was something like that.  I just need to figure out how to tell it when it needs to switch
 Wontonimo: a* is your friend here, as is flood fill
 Wontonimo: for&#160;? areas, you can do two things&#160;: assume they are open space until you are proven otherwise, or assume it is costly open space, like maybe 1.5 units of movement instead of 1, to represent the risk factor
 Wontonimo: I use A*
 Synergyforge: I was on the right track by trending toward the most&#160;?, but for one of the tests, it got stuck going up and down in the middle over and over.  lul.
 Synergyforge: I didn't progress beyond that so now I'm starting over with a new concept
 Synergyforge: Didn't get to the point of identifying the char at current location and finding the way back yet because I still hadn't worked in pathfinding beyond just "look around, and pick a direction, to make sure we don't hit a wall," basically.
 Wontonimo: 2 words&#160;:
 Wontonimo: unit
 Wontonimo: tests
 Synergyforge: yeah working on getting the first test case working first
 Wontonimo: if you are coding A*, make it testable with automated tests and do it locally
 Synergyforge: oh so that's the pastebin you use locally then
 Malcom2302.: Sup

 misclicker: but I didn't spam
 5DN1L: many spammers used that line too
 misclicker: but see the chat and you will belive me
 Synergyforge: Ummm
 Synergyforge: Just dial it back, bud.&#160;:)
 5DN1L: if you think you're behaving well then don't worry misclicker
 5DN1L: i didn't even mention your name when i said "no spamming"
 misclicker: oh ok
 Synergyforge: He meant me.  :)  I'm on a fast track to bantown.
 5DN1L: yeah ban Synergyforge
 misclicker: ok
 Synergyforge: Nice knowin ya!&#160;:)
 misclicker: you too
 misclicker: Am I dumb or I cant figure out how to do Asteroids?
 5DN1L: probably the latter
 5DN1L: what seems to be the issue?
 misclicker: I try to do the  coordinates but it wont work
 Synergyforge: Why can't both be true? :D  j/k
 5DN1L: you're ignored :P
 Synergyforge: ouch
 5DN1L: misclicker are you doing bash???
 misclicker: yes
 5DN1L: wow
 5DN1L: can't help you then
 Synergyforge: Dang
 5DN1L: i know very little bash
 misclicker: well what do you use
 5DN1L: python
 misclicker: ok
 misclicker: I will use that
 Synergyforge: Hmm... Maybe I should be building edges
 5DN1L: my approach is different from Wontonimo's. i just use find shortest path in all phases
 5DN1L: but my time to bed now
 5DN1L: bye for now
 Synergyforge: but you can't find a path if you don't yet have a destination
 Synergyforge: byeeeeeeeeeee
 5DN1L: i have&#160;? as a destination
 Synergyforge: I see.
 Synergyforge: Okay chat, mods are gone.  Time to act up! :D
 Synergyforge: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] aww, there are no tacos to take

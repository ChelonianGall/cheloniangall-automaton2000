 MadKnight: do u guys know what's data-driven programming&#160;?
 [Csongor]: I would advise you tp
 [Csongor]: search
 [Csongor]: using google
 gsomix: MadKnight, sure, you feed data and haha functions go brrr
 gsomix: oh no it's data-oriented
 gsomix: i have no clue then
 PrivatePirate_33ce: im a beginner here, can i get an explanation for Power of Thor Episode 1
 JisuranIchigatsu: it's a condition puzzle, no difficulties here
 JisuranIchigatsu: if else
 professional_dumbass: are you sure allis isn't a bot?
 professional_dumbass: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uv7ygu">https://prnt.sc/uv7ygu</a>
 professional_dumbass: him/her solved it in less than 2 mins
 professional_dumbass: and by no means is that a easy question
 professional_dumbass: didn't share the code either
 professional_dumbass: a bit suspicious
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: did you know there are official bots in clashes?
 Automaton2000: i do need to add some more
 Illedan: Automaton2000 How do I make my code 2x faster?
 Automaton2000: no idea how to use the same function
 jacek: delete system34
 MadKnight: remove half the operations Illedan
 Uljahn: make the rest of universe 2x slower
 Illedan: :D
 kovi: duh, seed is 64bit...
 Illedan: haha
 Westicles: Nice job Illedan.  Running offline?
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: Online still
 Illedan: Can get much higher offline
 kovi: hmm, is there spawn/bug when the field is full?
 Illedan: Should not? 
 kovi: may not be important, i just stop with prediction error in such case
 Illedan: Did it happend because of an incorrect command?
 Illedan: Only case where the board might still be full
 Illedan: and euler forgot to check for that case
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Seems he do indeed check it
 kovi: i cant see where

 Q12: What does it means?
 MadKnight: &gt; FatalProcessOutOfMemory
 Q12: Ok Thanks
 MadKnight: how much memory did u allocate&#160;?
 Q12: I just wanted to create a hash table for numbers but I think that because the numbers are so big I can't make hash table that use their value to point to their location in array
 MadKnight: what puzzle&#160;?
 Q12: Magic count of numbers
 MadKnight: true, it got 9234567891011 
 Q12: yeah
 MadKnight: wait didn't u mistook hashtable with cache arrya&#160;?
 Q12: pass all tests but the last two because of run time so now I try to reduce it
 MadKnight: because hashtable doesn't allocate memory for all possible things
 Q12: I use arrays as hash table.is there another option that I don't know about?
 MadKnight: array isn't a hash table
 Q12: So give me example for a hash table in JS so I can understand
 iliboss78: who want come to fight
 MadKnight: oh, u use js&#160;?
 Q12: yes
 MadKnight: oh then u are right
 MadKnight: it is a hash
 Q12: what lang did you talk about?
 MadKnight: i talked about arrays
 MadKnight: in general
 Saaalikh: hey
 Saaalikh: i want to clash with some real people for once
 Saaalikh: these public clashes are filled with bots ffs
 iliboss78: shut the fuck up saaalikh
 Saaalikh: are you a bot?
 iliboss78: no
 iliboss78: i'm just black
 Saaalikh: '_'
 Saaalikh: ok
 Saaalikh: im brown btw
 iliboss78: like poo
 Uljahn: iliboss78: stop being rude or ban
 iliboss78: i don't care
 MadKnight: okay then no reason not to ban
 MadKnight: don't forget #fr Uljahn
 iliboss78: shut up MadKnight i trying to sleep
 Uljahn: sleep well, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what would you do it in the viewer
 AntiSquid: hey iliboss78 how's it going?
 MadKnight: ask him on #fr, he's no more here
 AntiSquid: he's banned already?
 MadKnight: ye
 Nazdhun: hi. is there a way to send a user a PM on codingame.com&#160;?
 jacek: private message on their profile
 ____Mimil_____: hey guys
 Nazdhun: but only if the users follow each other?

 Illedan: Lol, crazy idea + 5 min code pays off :D
 dbdr: gg&#160;:)

 Illedan: Wow, first time 2 equal submits only gave 200k difference :O
 Illedan: Not only luck anymore :tada:
 dbdr: you use random?
 Illedan: Nah, but the timing is random
 ____Mimil_____: how report ,  mp?
 Cleinpresident: don't say
 ____Mimil_____: cleinpresident is not cool with me
 Cleinpresident: is trolling
 dbdr: MC Illedan?
 ____Mimil_____: can u report this guy plz
 Illedan: :angel:
 Illedan: Who knows :shrug:
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Cleinpresident: please 
 Cleinpresident: i m inocent
 Illedan: LOL
 Illedan: Ezpz
 wlesavo: nice
 Illedan: Wait a sec
 dbdr: ah, you failed 30M
 Illedan: new score INC
 dbdr: ignore above :D
 Illedan: Now
 Illedan: ^^
 dbdr: inb4 negative score above 2^31&#160;;)
 Illedan: hahah
 wlesavo: failed 40M ))
 dbdr: even bigger fail too
 Illedan: Damn
 Illedan: Told euler I thought it looked too easy
 dbdr: it's all relative
 dbdr: but yeah, harder would also help with replay size
 Alex00N: is  here anyone who has passed toptal's first tehnical test?
 Illedan: 40 mill&#160;;)
 Alex00N: they are pretty demanding
 LeRadovidVegan: Hello World!
 DomiKo: top score Illedan?
 ____Mimil_____: print("hello world")
 Illedan: Not yet
 wlesavo: Illedan nice 50M fail
 Illedan: Need 1000 more steps
 Illedan: and I solve it 
 Illedan: Gotta optimize
 Cleinpresident: if emilienFoussard parle trop:
 wlesavo: yeah optimal score should be possible
 Cleinpresident: print("tg")
 ____Mimil_____: modo can u see the mp, between me and clainpresident?
 Cleinpresident: emilien was in irl with me 
 ____Mimil_____: and can u expulse this guy
 ____Mimil_____: bro are u ok?
 dbdr: I looked at the referee, and I don't see how the testcase1 is fixed
 dbdr: looks random to me
 Illedan: Is it a validator?
 dbdr: validator 1
 Cleinpresident: ____mimil he hits me irl
 Illedan: hm
 Illedan: wierd
 Illedan: euler said it is not
 dbdr: well, what's the seed?
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Only CG knows

 dbdr: dirty euler coding :D
 Illedan: hahaha
 Illedan: OH
 Illedan: FML
 Illedan: It is possible to get the131072Tile
 Illedan: I need more speeed
 Illedan: 46 mill&#160;:)
 dbdr: a good problem to have
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GwBhbwRv-4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GwBhbwRv-4</a>
 DomiKo: You need speed!
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: MORE
 Westicles: The names are off 1 on the validators
 dbdr: how so?
 Westicles: Well, I only did the first one(290797) and it only works on the random seed validator
 dbdr: 290797 is the second one
 dbdr: oh, it does seem there is something off by one
 Westicles: yeah.
 dbdr: euler screwed up again
 dbdr: validators too&#160;;)
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Validators on CG are not the best implementation :P
 dbdr: I mean human validators
 Illedan: pff
 dbdr: kept holes, that they are now exploiting&#160;;)
 Illedan: Do we get score on submit for failed testcases?
 dbdr: I don't know. I know it won't count as top score
 Illedan: ok
 dbdr: the&#160;% is the first criteria
 Westicles: No, you get 0 for a failed case
 Westicles: Or if you hit an invalid move
 dbdr: Illedan, what's your max number of moves?
 kovi: uh, illedan. that is brutal
 dbdr: he has close to 50% of the total points on the lb LD
 jacek: LD?
 jacek: lucid dreaming&#160;:?
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: L and&#160;: are neighbours
 Agade: Lymphatic drain?
 Allis: Load distribution?
 dbdr: hey Agade!
 TomasV: local destination?
 AntiSquid: lol
 Allis: $ whatis ld
 Agade: hey dbdr
 dbdr: active these days on CG?
 Agade: Not really last thing I did was oware abapa I think
 Agade: I'm very slowly working on some CSB stuff...trying to do RL with python+Cpp
 dbdr: nice
 Agade: got #1 on oware but then jacek and robo got even better
 AntiSquid: what is jacek using in oware?
 Agade: AZ, probably
 Allis: What's AZ?
 Agade: Alpha Zero
 Allis: Derp.
 AntiSquid: jacek&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: ping him Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and you are above me
 dbdr: wlesavo, Illedan: how can a score be optimal?
 kovi: each call has 2^x
 kovi: cell
 dbdr: cannot you always go further, potentially
 dbdr:&#160;?
 kovi: you cant go further then
 dbdr: ah, so limited by 2^31?
 kovi: 2^32-1 i guess
 dbdr: java is always signed
 kovi: well, that is not the score
 kovi: that is the visual sum of current numbers
 dbdr: I mean 2^32 never occurs in java
 dbdr: it's either 2^31 or 2^63
 kovi: wait i meant 2^17 - 1
 kovi: sorry
 kovi: not sure about the limit of the score
 kovi: if everything comes as 2 it is 2x as if 4-s coming all the time
 AntiSquid: 3,932,156&#160;?!
 dbdr: what's that AntiSquid?
 dbdr: kovi, i'm not following how what comesmatters
 WhiteGlove: I need 5 mins with a java guru
 jacek: oO
 dbdr: nice, wlesavo is emerging&#160;:)
 wlesavo: nah, my broken sim emerged to its full power :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: is there a limit to printing 10k chars at once?
 MadKnight: how do i connect to cg chat with websockets? what uri do i use&#160;?
 DomiKo: wlesave I guess there is a limit
 DomiKo: when I printed too much i got timelimit
 jrke: yeah printing too much timeouts sometimes
 AntiSquid: the max score 2048 on single board dbdr
 dbdr: ah, 2^1 + 2^2 + ...&#160;?
 dbdr: right, you need space for the intermediates
 AntiSquid: you need to count all the combos that lead up to the higher numbers too
 AntiSquid: checked google for math on the number .
 wlesavo: yeah the score is close to max_num*(log(max_num)*2)
 wlesavo: petition for eulerscheZahl to draw only the final state of the board after many actions were outputed
 Illedan: You can add -
 Illedan: and get no viewer
 Illedan: Just add a comment on the state
 dbdr: what's strange is there is still lag when using -
 Illedan: He doesn't reduce the time on each frame without the viewer
 Illedan: guess those tousands of sec is causes some lagg
 Illedan: :P
 kovi:&#160;:)
 dbdr: only data size should matter
 Illedan: Game information:Maximum number of player interactions (600) reachedscore: 2020388
 dbdr: you can be #7 with a single grid :D
 Illedan: xD
 DomiKo: 2Mln is nice
 DomiKo: I got like 1.6Mln with 40K moves
 DomiKo: how many moves you make?
 Illedan: 47k
 Illedan: You get the 131072 tile after about 43k moves
 dbdr: oh, that's why the score can grow exponentially
 Illedan: I get the 2048 tile on the first sec xD
 jacek: so you need 18bits per tile?
 jacek: wait, 18* different states
 Illedan: Score should just be the sum of tiles on the board, would be easier to see the actual progression this way :P
 kovi: yes
 dbdr: 49M
 dbdr: still improving?
 jrke: so there is random test cases also
 dbdr: no
 jrke: so can still hardcore?
 dbdr: maybe not because of the size limit
 jrke: hmmm
 jrke: whats maximum no. of turns?
 dbdr: 600
 jrke: so we have max 4 ** 600 game states
 dbdr: no, you can output multiple moves per turn
 Westicles: say 50k characters times 30 validators
 dbdr: ill said 47k moves
 jrke: oke
 jrke: is there any logic on spawing of new tiles 
 jrke: or its random 
 dbdr: it's in the referee
 dbdr: not random
 wlesavo: lol broken sim depth 7 bruteforce able to achieve 4096
 nxnjitsu: bruh
 Westicles: unicode is 8 bytes?  so you could fit 32 moves per character?
 DomiKo: not really
 DomiKo: or I don't know how to do it
 DomiKo: I tried using base65536 but it sometimes have double charaters&#160;:((
 dbdr: unicode is not 8 bytes
 Westicles: c++ has char32_t
 dbdr: 32 bits is not 8 bytes either&#160;;)
 jrke: damn 49 million
 DomiKo: move has to use 2 bits
 Westicles: heh heh, oops
 nxnjitsu: allow send answers
 EMG21: no
 EMG21: shut up
 jacek: oO
 Metanoob: heyo
 Shadowtick: hi
 jacek: good afternoon
 Shadowtick: how are you doing?
 AntiSquid: ok
 Shadowtick: I thought my classes ended at midnight last night but no it was just the ones due this month
 Shadowtick: I was rushing through everything like I gotta get it done!!!
 Shadowtick: isnt that sad
 CSharp_Sama: God I've been offline for so long
 CSharp_Sama: too longe actually
 CSharp_Sama: long :flushed:
 Metanoob: good thanks and yourself?
 Shadowtick: 𝕒𝕟𝕪𝕨𝕒𝕪𝕤 𝕨𝕙𝕒𝕥 𝕕𝕠 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕨𝕒𝕟𝕟𝕒 𝕕𝕠?
 The_Auditor: what happened to AutomatonNN&#160;?
 CSharp_Sama: AutomatonNN where are you
 CSharp_Sama: :flushed: he's gone
 CSharp_Sama: :sob:
 Metanoob: Automaton2000 where is AutomatonNN?
 Automaton2000: i am not even sure if it is a very bad idea
 Metanoob: thanks for the swift reply man
 The_Auditor: even Automaton2000 is sad about his pal AutomatonNN
 Automaton2000: right now i have an issue with my code on github
 Metanoob: Sure you do buddy
 Shadowtick: alright imma go draw something on ms paint website
 Metanoob: hf!
 Shadowtick: because I wanna draw some art
 The_Auditor: Automaton2000 doesn't think that is art
 Automaton2000: much much better than i expected
 Shadowtick: but it will probably look horrible anyways so brb
 The_Auditor: i stand corrected , Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: thats pretty much the same as the test cases
 Shadowtick: back
 Shadowtick: I drew a infinite box
 Shadowtick: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/gLqcHT4.png">https://i.imgur.com/gLqcHT4.png</a>
 Shadowtick: Because thats the best I can do rn
 Astrobytes: Shadowtick: Why do you hang around here
 CSharp_Sama: :wave:
 Astrobytes: hi
 CSharp_Sama: How's life
 Magus: Metanoob: AutomatonNN has a little issue right now. Because i was trying to update him, and it failed. So at the moment AutomatonNN won't boot because of a bad dependency chain ....&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Plodding along. You?
 Magus: Automaton2000 is innocent.
 CSharp_Sama: I'm living
 Metanoob: ouch, thanks for the heads up Magus
 Automaton2000: if you want to simulate the entire game
 Astrobytes: hi Metanoob
 Metanoob: hey Astrobytes!
 Shadowtick: Astrobytes it's because I can and because I have nowhere else to go
 eulerscheZahl: 49 million :o
 eulerscheZahl: well done illedan
 The_Auditor: the student amazes the teacher
 eulerscheZahl: the seal amazes the toad
 dbdr: TIL Illedan is a seal
 Shadowtick: welp imma go back to ms paint and paint more
 The_Auditor: Automation2000 did not see your previous creation
 The_Auditor: Automaton2000 did not see your previous creation
 Automaton2000: sure, but you can make it work
 NIKIMINAG: the hell is this
 The_Auditor: can you be more specific, Automaton2000 is confused
 Automaton2000: they might be a bad move
 wlesavo: MC does a little bit better than brute force, but still quite sad 
 The_Auditor: so, on the weekly challange, i improved the logic and my score dropped&#160;:) 
 eulerscheZahl: i see some difference in scores achieved
 eulerscheZahl: weekly challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: onitama?
 The_Auditor: just like in RL you fix one bug and the app crashes, because the other bugs were relying on the bug that was fixed
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/onitama/leaderboard</a>is it me or are the scores missing?
 The_Auditor: i see scores
 dbdr: I don't
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uvi11m">https://prnt.sc/uvi11m</a>so naked
 dbdr: you're 246th?
 The_Auditor: sorry, i see scores in the lateral leaderboard on the puzzle
 jrke: yeah he is
 eulerscheZahl: i rock at CSB B)
 whothehelliskolev: Greetings. What is the version of python? And have you guys tried to use assignment operator in list comprehension? It seems to give an invalid syntax error when running the tests
 wlesavo: its working again
 jacek: python 3.7.4+
 jrke: anybody knows ML here
 jacek: print (sys.version)
 whothehelliskolev: Oh, I see. Thank you!
 eulerscheZahl: jacek that question is for you<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-onitama/144170">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-onitama/144170</a>
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, how deep do you beam?
 jacek: mhm?
 eulerscheZahl: beam me up Spock
 eulerscheZahl:    const int searchDepth = 50;
 dbdr: :D
 jrke: euler here is one stupid doubt if row = 4 4 4 4 and i play L then it will be 8 8 0 0 or 16 0 0 0 
 jacek: 8 8 0 0
 jrke: oke
 wlesavo: it is explicitly said so in example
 jrke: it was there but there was none for if both tiles are newly made(btw i said stupid doubt)
 The_Auditor: that would be like castling in chess
 eulerscheZahl: kudos to ille for making me add an example
 darkhorse64: The rule is that there are no cascading merges
 jacek: like chaning flips in othello in early drafts
 eulerscheZahl: may the source be with you<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/2048/blob/master/src/main/java/engine/Board.java#L106">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/2048/blob/master/src/main/java/engine/Board.java#L106</a>
 darkhorse64: or chaining destructions in smash the code
 MSmits: or me just writing spam walls
 eulerscheZahl: you are a cascading spammer?I knew it!
 MSmits: :flushed:
 The_Auditor: yes&#160;! it's java!
 eulerscheZahl: referees are almost always javahas to be a JVM language
 MSmits: havent seen someone this enthousiastic about Java since wel... ever
 The_Auditor: you obviously did not have to work with C
 MSmits: c++
 jacek: kree java!
 The_Auditor: when java came about  i was 10x more enthusiastic
 eulerscheZahl: the move function might be a little crypticbut i golfed it in less than 40 lines with all 4 directions
 The_Auditor: c++ has evolved over the years, not as punishing a c
 eulerscheZahl: strings in C are fun :sick:
 The_Auditor: c is like a katana, very sharp, but you don't want to make salad with it
 AntiSquid: C is the alpha stage of C++
 MSmits: c++ never got out of beta
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BETA_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BETA_(programming_language)</a>
 dbdr: I did a summer research project at the university developping BETA as a student&#160;:)
 MSmits: interesting
 MSmits: I prefer shakespeare though
 AntiSquid: you were a student at "Scandinavian School"&#160;?
 dbdr: visiting
 dbdr: we had to go abroad in the second year
 dbdr: which was great
 AntiSquid: exchange program&#160;?
 dbdr: not an exchange, I could pick anywhere in the world
 dbdr: I wanted to work on Eiffel, but Meyer never responded :D
 AntiSquid: oh. i would pick somewhere warm and sunny
 dbdr: Denmark is nice in the summer
 CHT-DAT: hi
 The_Auditor: hello
 dbdr: the sea is still a bit cold&#160;:)
 dbdr: but the 20 hours of daylight were fun&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: :thinking:
 dbdr: at 3, you don't know if it's 3am or 3pm, looks the same
 AntiSquid: 20&#160;?
 AntiSquid: in denmark&#160;?!
 dbdr: roughly
 CHT-DAT: i am vietnamese bro
 MSmits: sun was low I imagine
 MSmits: not too bright
 MSmits: hi vietnamese bro
 MSmits: I am Dutch bro
 CHT-DAT: No way bro
 MSmits: way
 AntiSquid: i never lived that far up north 
 CHT-DAT: Do you know "Chào em"??
 AntiSquid: is it edible&#160;?
 MSmits: is he/she also a vietnamese bro/gal?
 MSmits: or edible. sure
 CHT-DAT: I hate China a lots
 MSmits: noted
 CHT-DAT: We call them Ching Chong
 AntiSquid: .
 AntiSquid: ya ok drop it
 eulerscheZahl: you are working towards a kick
 AntiSquid: every language sounds weird to outsiders, let's not be rude CHT-DAT ... feel free to complain about non-racial related stuff
 MSmits: and...
 MSmits: (religion?)
 CHT-DAT: Oke i am fine
 AntiSquid: idk
 The_Auditor: and politics
 AntiSquid: i mean you could talk about censorship
 MSmits: what if he complains about you censoring him&#160;? :P
 The_Auditor: we can talk about use of AI in censorship
 AntiSquid: why can't you jokingly call someone winnie the pooh&#160;?
 CHT-DAT: Do you hate china bro??
 AntiSquid: that's fine MSmits
 AntiSquid: no CHT-DAT
 AntiSquid: no motivation . 
 MSmits: AntiSquid feels only love
 AntiSquid: i hate SJWs i admit that
 MSmits: JWS&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: love is in the polluted air :notes:
 CHT-DAT: You do not know our feeling bro
 The_Auditor: @CHT-DAT what programming language do you use&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i am aware a lot of neighboring countries hate china for being "intrusive"
 MSmits: similar to Russia
 MSmits: I suppose
 The_Auditor: @MSmiths you stepped in it
 MSmits: the :poop:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: CHT-DAT apply for americahn citizenship and vote trump, he will make chyna pay
 The_Auditor: yep, i did not what to mention my feelings , but now...
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000 voted already
 Automaton2000: you can still work on your bot
 CHT-DAT:  I am not good at English but i love my country and you can not know what CHINA has done to us bro
 MSmits: yes it's not too late, thanks Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and i don't know how it is in the contest
 MSmits: it's soon
 The_Auditor: @AntiSquid i don't think the citizenship process works that fast
 The_Auditor: 5 years for green card + 5 years for citizenship
 AntiSquid: was a joke
 AllYourMCTS: anyone know how many CPUs the machines that bots run on have?
 AntiSquid: you also don't know which way a country is actually headed in 10 years
 MSmits: AllYourMCTS doesnt matter, you only get to use 1 cpu
 The_Auditor: if you are lucky and win the "greencard lottery" then its is still 5 years for citizenship
 AllYourMCTS: oh damn
 MSmits: be glad, saves you from having to parallize
 MSmits: to be competitive
 The_Auditor: @AntiSquid i agree with you, it's a jke
 AntiSquid: and if you are lucky to not have your house burnt down or get shot The_Auditor .
 AllYourMCTS: man i was just working on a threadpool in rust and was looking forward to doubling the speed tho
 AntiSquid: i think it's ok, if that's what they want to do . their choice The_Auditor
 AllYourMCTS: that makes sense
 dbdr: MSmits won
 dbdr: 't you join
 dbdr: the 2048 fun when it's hot?
 The_Auditor: So, apply for Canadian residency&#160;! you gcan apply for citizenship only after 3 years of living in Canada&#160;!
 MSmits: i don't need to, you just said I won
 dbdr: :P
 MSmits: nah, it doesn't attract me that much
 AntiSquid: in china you never get full status even when married to a chinese national so w/e The_Auditor
 MSmits: i guess i'll write some bot at some point, but not soon
 MSmits: AntiSquid even if you get full status, you live in a country that monitors your every move. 
 MSmits: no freedom
 AntiSquid: UK is getting kinda close to that MSmits
 MSmits: doubt it
 MSmits: sounds like hyperbole
 AntiSquid: hah .
 MSmits: it might be moving from 0 to 1 in a scale of 0 to 10 being North Korea I assume
 The_Auditor: many countries are getting to that, ppl just like to kick china arround
 dbdr: with a phone in your pocket, "they" literally kno your every move
 AntiSquid: i think GDPR won't be as strongly enforced after brexit MSmits
 AntiSquid: there's cameras everywhere in UK
 MSmits: sure, but it also matters what they are used for
 AntiSquid: internet data is kept by the ISP for a 6 months if i remember correctly
 AntiSquid: and not sure if any laws changed recently . 
 AntiSquid: regarding privacy
 The_Auditor: I have a question: if aliens find earth and notice they like to eate humans, would they care what country the food comes from?
 MSmits: in China there are regions (not sure how many places now) where they use point systems to show if you have good behavior
 MSmits: the cameras are used for this
 AntiSquid: everyone is now automatically opt-in on organ-donor list in UK and you have to opt out, it took me by surprise really . 
 MSmits: thats fine with me actually
 dbdr: this specific one, me too
 MSmits: people are too lazy to think about it, so they have to do this
 MSmits: otherwise noone signs up
 MSmits: because of pure laziness
 AntiSquid: i would like to be more aware of such changes .
 MSmits: here they made us aware of it, i guess that should have been done better in your case
 AntiSquid: was in the talks since last year, went live in march afaik and i found out about it in september 
 dbdr: there is a talk about the importance of default settings, organ donation was a main example
 AntiSquid: but the main news was never covering it
 MSmits: yeah that seems bad AntiSquid
 The_Auditor: @AntiSquid I think what cardashians did recently is more important then organ donation laws
 Metanoob: The Auditor, comparable to humans eating fish, does it matter the ocean/sea? In a way it does, if your favorite taste of fish  is located in a specific area
 dbdr: problem is not enough people pay for quality news
 The_Auditor: where can i pay for quality news&#160;?
 AntiSquid: where can i find neutral news&#160;?
 dbdr: neutral does not exist
 dbdr: and that's fine. good to use several sources, but also care about quality
 The_Auditor: neutral is a subset of quality in news domain
 Hjax: i like this site, but it seems to be mostly USA news <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news">https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news</a>
 dbdr: what does neutral mean?
 dbdr: everyone has perspective based on their background
 AntiSquid: i mean anything that isn't a political echo chamber
 dbdr: and that's fine
 dbdr: sure, if your goal is to prove one party is better than another no matter what, it's not going to be quality
 AntiSquid: you can look at 2 opposing views and still not get the honest truth .
 Hjax: you can, but at least you can evaluate both perspectives for yourself 
 Hjax: which is important 
 dbdr: sure. the biggest lie is that there are only two sides to an issue
 eulerscheZahl: even the selection of what's worth reporting is biased already
 Hjax: also morning/afternoon/evening everyone :D 
 AntiSquid: journalistic silence is journalistic violence /s 
 eulerscheZahl: good afternoon&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: and if i don't to see you for the rest of the day good night 
 Hjax: i agree theres no such thing as unbiased news, imo the best you can do is expose yourself to lots of different perspectives

 Hjax: at least in the USA the whole "us vs them" mentality is super prevalent, and not very productive
 dbdr: yes. sometimes I force myself to watch a talk after I realize I really disagree with the speaker
 dbdr: can be interesting
 Shadowtick: hello again
 Shadowtick: gtg bye
 AntiSquid: what so soon? oh damn
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: are you aware the validator names don't correspond to the actual seeds?
 dbdr: they are off by one
 MindController: Can some1 help me with hard puzzle surface?

 eulerscheZahl: and i would be surprised if this will get resolved before the next contest
 dbdr: ah, I see:  "isValidator": "false"
 eulerscheZahl: priotity: lowi think :D
 eulerscheZahl: i spelled that wrong

 dbdr: in SMTP
 dbdr: jacek&#160;?
 jacek: forum onitama
 Shadowtick: hi everyone
 jacek: how may we help you, Sir/Madam
 The_Auditor: hello
 pharesmostafa: ho
 pharesmostafa: hi
 pharesmostafa: start
 pharesmostafa: hello guys any one know c++
 jacek: i know him, c++ is nice guy
 MSmits: i think he's obnoxious
 Einwickler: Has a hard time with memory sometimes though. He can be really resentful
 MSmits: and when he is easygoing, he takes it to extremes
 dbdr: If C allows you to shoot yourself in the foot, then C++ is giving you a machine gun! -- James Prince
 jacek: what does rust give you?
 Allis: Tetanus.
 dbdr: memory corruption and data race safety at compile time
 dbdr: without performance penalty
 Astrobytes: well played Allis
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: do you mean it gives you memory corruption and also data race safety, or does it give you safety for both those thingS?
 MSmits: I can read that both ways dbdr
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: guess&#160;;)
 MSmits: ahh well, I guess I always thought rust was better in all ways, but if it can corrupt your memory...
 dbdr: you *can* if you really want to&#160;:)
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: I corrupt memory a lot
 dbdr: you have to tell the compiler this is an unsafe section
 MSmits: ah see, that's more work than I would have to do in c++. It just assumes everything is unsafe
 jacek: which is true
 dbdr: yes, it's more work. the idea is to make the safe way easy and short, and the dangerous one longer but possible
 Hjax: i always heard the quote as "C++ makes it harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but when you do you lose your whole leg" 
 Astrobytes: I think Stroustrup himself said that one
 Hjax: but yeah, from what ive seen is that rust tries really hard to make the most logical/most rust friendly approach also be the approach that results in safe code with fewer bugs 
 Hjax: so once you get used to thinking in rusts philosophy, you get the benefits for free mostly 
 Hjax: i do wish we could get a newer rust version on codingame, the language is updated so frequently 
 JBM: wait till you hear about the haskell lag
 jacek: hm?
 Shadowtick: привет
 Shadowtick: I am learning Russian :3
 Shadowtick: привет means hi
 dbdr: #ru
 Shadowtick: I am not joining that until I am fluent in russian
 JBM: that's kind of backwards
 JBM: joining would *help* you become fluent
 dbdr: I'm not going in a simming pool until I know how to swimm
 JBM: i'm not coding in C++ until I'm through with the '20 spec
 Shadowtick: I am using <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.duolingo.com/learn">https://www.duolingo.com/learn</a> to help me learn
 JBM: i used to
 JBM: 'tsall MadKnight's fault
 Shadowtick: madknight told me it is a good one
 dbdr: do you still do?&#160;;)
 JBM: nope
 01000110_01110100: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Shadowtick: I am using it because I wont get side tracked on it
 01000110_01110100: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Hjax: yeah the swimming analogy for language learning i hear a lot 
 JBM: i had a frontal with their handling streaks wrt timezones and lost a *long* streak
 dbdr: 01000110_01110100 stop
 Hjax: sitting on the beach reading about swimming isnt going to work 
 Hjax: gotta get in the water
 JBM: that killed my motivation
 Astrobytes: immersion technique
 JBM: (no, it did *not* motivate me to pay $10 to keep the streak)

 JBM: the funny thing is
 JBM: i got notifications for my suggestions/corrections being accepted
 JBM: years after i stopped
 Shadowtick: 𝕚 𝕒𝕞 𝕘𝕠𝕟𝕟𝕒 𝕘𝕠 𝕜𝕖𝕖𝕡 𝕝𝕖𝕒𝕣𝕟𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕞𝕠𝕣𝕖 𝕣𝕦𝕤𝕤𝕚𝕒𝕟
 JBM: please do
 dbdr: a CP market place would totally work
 Hjax: ive been trying to learn japanese, its quite difficult, but its fun 
 JBM: it's a nice language
 Shadowtick: yes it is
 dbdr: solves CG financing and pro players needs at the same time&#160;:)
 Shadowtick: and I actually want to learn russian for 3 reasons
 Shadowtick: 2*
 JBM: that's better than 2
 JBM: ok
 dbdr: *1
 JBM: that's better than 1
 dbdr: Взлететь
 JBM: that's kind of...
 Shadowtick: its because I know two Russian game characters in two different games and because I always wanted to learn russian
 JBM: feels
 JBM: incomplete
 dbdr: is it?
 Shadowtick: :3
 JBM: i dunno,. ask the natives
 Shadowtick: yata yadeza oof oof oof oof oof oof ooooooooof
 Shadowtick: just imagine someone making a video but instead of ora ora ora its oof oof oof
 Shadowtick: but thats never gonna happen
 Shadowtick: brb imma learn more russian
 Astrobytes: ...
 Shadowtick: Я вернулся
 AntiSquid: go to #RU for russian
 Shadowtick: sorry didn't mean to put it
 Shadowtick: I've returned and is there a Korean channel by any chance?
 Shadowtick: because I am learning korean also
 AntiSquid: #KR
 JBM: but he's not fluent yet!
 Shadowtick: thanks
 Shadowtick: I have a couple of friends irl that know Korean
 Shadowtick: so I know some words in korean
 AntiSquid: like what
 Shadowtick: 안녕하세요 is hello.잘 지냈어 is how are you doing좋은 하루 되세요 is have a good day
 AntiSquid: spamming random wrods makes perfect JBM
 Shadowtick: you asked me what words I know in korean
 Shadowtick: so I answered your question
 AntiSquid: but can you spell it out with european alphabet without looking at google?
 JBM: spelling korean with a european alphabet is a weird request
 Shadowtick: I had to enable the korean keyboard setting
 AntiSquid: he uses hangul
 AntiSquid: sure
 AntiSquid: spell the letter z with korean alphabet Shadowtick to prove you know how to write korean 
 JBM: what purpose would that achieve?
 JBM: random testing to assess his motivation for something totally extrinsic to the chan's values?
 Burnerlover: im at school wtf phython 3 is hard
 jacek: thats what she said
 AntiSquid: omg seriously these no avatar users are criticizing a lot aren't they?
 Astrobytes: use python 3 instead
 JBM: i'm on pidgin
 JBM: *all* users are no-avatar
 Burnerlover: i am on python 3
 JBM: tough
 Burnerlover: luck
 JBM: yeah
 Astrobytes: was a joke playing on your typo Burnerlover
 Burnerlover: well adios england is boring
 Burnerlover: k
 AntiSquid: python is easiest
 Burnerlover: o
 Burnerlover: im embarrassed cause it hard
 Burnerlover: im new to coding
 Astrobytes: Everyone's a beginner at some point
 AntiSquid: it's ok
 AntiSquid: just take it easy, step by step, first upload an avatar
 Burnerlover: done
 Burnerlover: not loading yet tho
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid: out of curiosity, on a scale of 1 to Norman Bates, how mad does the no avatar issue get you? :P
 Shadowtick: ready to get a korean z AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: not all, it's just that CG chat is running a special promotion where you get an extra kick before getting banned if you have an anime avatar and don't want users to miss out on potential benefit
 Burnerlover: 3 
 Astrobytes: :rolling_eyes:
 Burnerlover: anyways is there a python 1 and 2?
 Burnerlover: cause whya re they not there then?
 Shadowtick: ...
 AntiSquid: well the history about python 1 is very interesting and i forgot it so i suggest looking it up . python 2 is kinda old so it's just python 3 now
 Astrobytes: Python 3 is newest, used to have python 2 but it was removed. Kind of irrelevant for the platform, only use is for maintaining legacy stuff I guess
 Burnerlover: okthen
 Burnerlover: i  gono take python 1
 Burnerlover: on another website
 Burnerlover: but dont worry
 Burnerlover: i will come back
 AntiSquid: there is no python 1
 Metanoob: good luck I guess?
 AntiSquid: and you might not even find python 2
 Burnerlover: there isnt?
 AntiSquid: well there is and isn't
 Metanoob: nah not really
 Burnerlover: dang well guess im staying here
 Burnerlover: yay
 Astrobytes: It's not like 1, 2 and 3 are difficulty settings&#160;;)
 Burnerlover: ok thanks that would be scarie
 Metanoob: the main syntactic difference between python 2 and 3 is that in python 3 you have to print with braces&#160;: print('Hello World!')
 Metanoob: the rest is libraries/apis
 Burnerlover: yeah i noticed you use print("X")
 AntiSquid: some functions work differently . so just use py3
 Burnerlover: x is a varible
 Burnerlover: kk
 Burnerlover: th
 Burnerlover: x
 Burnerlover: i will join the discord too
 Astrobytes: parantheses Metanoob :P
 Burnerlover: lul bye doing school work
 Metanoob: thanks!! braces are for teeth
 Metanoob: :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: {}
 Iuliep:&#160;:(
 Iuliep:&#160;:)
 Iuliep: :D
 Iuliep: :P
 Iuliep: :O
 Iuliep: Oo
 Iuliep: &gt;:(
 Metanoob: that's probably my biggest struggle with english there, how to name those chars
 Metanoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70b4e927-1fc1-44e9-b829-838197b4797f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/70b4e927-1fc1-44e9-b829-838197b4797f</a>
 AntiSquid: accolades 
 AntiSquid: duckduckgo pastebin
 Metanoob: is curly braces acceptable too right?
 Metanoob: yeah I tried formatting and naming all those chars I knew, turns out I must have created an 'effed up code snippet
 AntiSquid: no
 AntiSquid: chat pastebin is borken
 Astrobytes: yeah {} can be curly braces
 Metanoob: oh alright, I don't know well the features of the chat actually
 Metanoob: cool ty Astrobytes
 Burnerlover: im on the decent rn and i got past decending mountains but nothing else, help?
 Shadowtick: what is going on here?
 Shadowtick: I come back from coding something on khan academy and I see this
 AntiSquid: don't ruin it Shadowtick
 Burnerlover:&#160;?
 Burnerlover: anyone help with python 3 the decent 
 Shadowtick: ok I won't AntiSquid
 Shadowtick: because I am getting off anyway
 Iuliep: why is pastebin brocken?
 Astrobytes: It happens sometimes, should be back soon
 Iuliep: oh ok thanks
 Iuliep: what you do to get better at solving puzzles? i am doing pretty well in clash of code but i have some dificults at the puzzles. I know they are suposed to be hard but what you guy do to get better at solving them?
 Astrobytes: Are you doing the easy ones?
 Hjax: clash isnt great practice, its better to take your time and work through more difficult puzzles than to spam through easy ones in clash 
 Iuliep: i do some easy onew
 Iuliep: ones
 Hjax: which puzzle is giving you trouble?
 Iuliep: not some puzzle in special 
 Astrobytes: Have a look at the tags on the puzzles, usually gives you some insight into what you need to know/learn
 Iuliep: but idk what to do when i cant finish one
 Astrobytes: Keep trying and don't give up, ask for help/advice, read the forum threads (if there is one)
 Hjax: yeah people are more than happy to give you a hint to push you in the right direction 
 Hjax: maybe its just an algorithm you dont know yet
 Astrobytes: ^
 Hjax: we can tell you the name of it so you can go learn it 
 Iuliep: oh ok
 Iuliep: i usually wasnt going to ask for advice
 Iuliep: i was tring myself
 Iuliep: but didnt find a clue 
 Astrobytes: tl;dr: don't be afraid to ask/look for some advice
 Hjax: trying for yourself first is fine, but its better to get help and learn something than give up 
 Hjax: besides 50% of my job as a software engineer is using google anyway :P
 Astrobytes: Definitely doign the right thing by trying as hard as you can first
 Astrobytes: *doing
 Astrobytes: lol
 Iuliep: if you ask for one that is giving a hard time
 Iuliep: isnt really a hard time
 Iuliep: but idk why i dont get 100
 Iuliep: is a easy one
 Iuliep: back robbers
 Iuliep: can i upload my code or something?

 Astrobytes: ah, use pastebin.com or something instead
 Hjax: the paste thing is broken today&#160;:(
 Iuliep: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/5qki3sR7">https://pastebin.com/5qki3sR7</a>
 Iuliep: i think this is
 Iuliep: is in C++
 Astrobytes:  you don't need that whole second for loop
 Iuliep:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: And you should think about at which point you need to sort
 Iuliep: i soretd after i calcualted all the vaults
 Iuliep: sorted*
 Iuliep: after i am subtrating the smalles number from all the vaults for how many robbers there are
 battlelife6: hay can someone  help me with this coding
 AntiSquid: no, because nobody knows what you are referring to
 Astrobytes: Think about how you might be able to do it in a single loop Iuliep
 Hjax: ok i solved the puzzle, im unable to access pastebin, but i can answer questions 
 battlelife6: im talking about code royale
 Hjax: there was a pin at the top of ##python on freenode for a long time, maybe its still there
 Hjax: "Don't ask to ask"
 battlelife6: i can send my curent code
 Hjax: its better to just ask your question rather than showing up with a "hey i have a question"

 Hjax: the paste thingy is broken today battlelife6
 AntiSquid: just state what your problem is and where you are stuck BattlePirateVanDerSwag_35df
 Astrobytes: use pastebin.com battlelife6
 AntiSquid: battlelife6
 jacek: only today?
 Astrobytes: was ok the other day
 AntiSquid: didn't see it work all week
 battlelife6: sory never mind
 Astrobytes: may have been momentarily, or I may not have had my coffee at the time :P

 Hjax: man on the big heist it takes the robbers 3 months to get in, this bank must have some pretty terrible security 
 Astrobytes: lmao
 Astrobytes: Iuliep: any progress?
 Illedan: dbdr at your question at 1 PM. Was just a random submit giving me 49 mill. I'm still a little away from max limit
 Astrobytes: Nice AntiSquid, the oceans can be as weird as space
 AntiSquid: they're streaming non-stop it seems. just randomly chekcing their stream from time to time
 Illedan: And I can only get the 131k tile if I get a 4 tile spawn at that exact round xD
 kovi: ofc
 Hjax: the good 2048 replays probably look silly, the tile will always spawn in the lucky place :D 
 Hjax: (obviously not luck because the rng is predictable)
 Hjax: (but it will /look/ lucky :D )
 Astrobytes: I've not written anything serious for that yet, just output the same sequence every time
 Astrobytes: One of my favourite timewasting games lol
 Hjax: submit spamming?
 Astrobytes: no, 2048 :P
 Astrobytes: as in 2048 is a favourite timewasting game. My submit is just outputting ULDR repeatedly
 dbdr: Astrobytes: I hear ULR is better
 Astrobytes: I got better with ULDR I think, lemme check
 dbdr: not sure which one exactly, but 3 directions, not 4
 kovi: does it matter which 3?&#160;:)
 dbdr: yes for finite number of seeds
 DomiKo: ohhh no
 DomiKo: 1.4Mln
 DomiKo: I have squeeze more
 kovi: what is your depth now?
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes seriously? just the full sequence?
 Astrobytes: cout &lt;&lt; "ULDR" &lt;&lt; endl;
 <b>**AntiSquid competing for best 0 effort submit</b></p><p><img src="/a/44990769450746" /> AntiSquid: and you just resubmitted that? heh&#160;?
 Astrobytes: resubmitted?
 dbdr: if you count effort per points, ULDR is high
 Astrobytes: happy now Hjax &amp; AntiSquid? :P
 AntiSquid: sorry
 Hjax: im trying other permutations 
 AntiSquid: i just couldn't believe it
 Hjax: but hit the submit limit lol 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, better to check in IDE first Hjax
 Hjax: are the cases the same?
 Astrobytes: Don't think so but there seemed to be a good indication that shit scores in the IDE meant shit scores on submit :P
 Hjax: :D
 DomiKo: Hjax yes
 DomiKo: they are the same
 Hjax: theres no way to see the sum of the ide tests though is there?
 Astrobytes: I stand corrected
 AntiSquid: when game first came out i tried ULDR and didn't give me good score compared to ULR so i thought that's best instant score
 AntiSquid: + only needed 1 single line of it not multiple ones
 Hjax: i wish this game gave me legal moves
 Illedan: lol
 Hjax: im lazy and dont want to figure it out 
 AntiSquid: ya same
 Illedan: I have 20 unit tests to verify my logic :P
 Astrobytes: Sim should be easy enough to implement, not looked at the ref yet
 Astrobytes: you're 100% online Illedan right?
 AntiSquid: not if you're lazy
 Illedan: yeah
 Illedan: dbdr offline?
 Astrobytes: nice
 dbdr:&#160;?
 Hjax: oh if i do 2048 im definitely doing it offline lol 
 Illedan: Solving it offline dbdr?
 dbdr: ah. no
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 kovi: lately i test sim through playing (checking predict from last turn vs. input of next turn)
 dbdr: what's your secret Illedan?
 Astrobytes: usually a good way to test the sim
 DomiKo: Hjax offline is not great for top scores I guess
 DomiKo: One test case have length 40K+ 
 DomiKo: so you have to make a lot of parsing
 Illedan: secret?
 Astrobytes: as in 'Give us your algo' :P
 Illedan: Oh
 Illedan: Sure

 DomiKo: I guess your algo crashed
 Illedan: Yeah just did
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: I keep sending only - and it is valid by the engine 
 Illedan: :D
 DomiKo: You have to resubmit
 DomiKo: is there any blog about parsing data in CG?

 Astrobytes: thanks to our Toad
 Hjax: i have beaten the completely random solution by attempting to play legal moves :D 
 Illedan: :clap:
 Illedan: Soon 1st? ezpz
 Astrobytes: share your code or get kicked! (i'm joking!)
 DomiKo: and that's C#
 DomiKo: imagine speed in C++
 eulerscheZahl: share your code and get kicked
 Illedan: Oh, nice we have Moves and score information now &lt;3
 Illedan: thx
 Astrobytes: spoilerscheZahl strikes again :rolling_eyes: :P
 Astrobytes: oh, nice update
 Hjax: im almost the best dumb heuristic bot 
 Hjax: not sure if i should be proud or sad 
 Astrobytes: lol, gj
 Astrobytes: anyways, out for tonight. Laters all&#160;:)
 Hjax: cya
 kovi: oho
 kovi: hjax: i almost reach 100k with dumb (well not so dumb, but no actual simu)
 dbdr: gg kovi
 kovi: thx dbdr
 Illedan: Nice, closing in!
 Hjax: whats the maximum number of moves you print in a turn Illedan
 Illedan: Like in the first sec?
 Hjax: yeah 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Illedan, like 20M wasn't enough?
 Illedan: 1300 on the first sec
 Hjax: 1300 is quite a few, and you are just using some beam search i imagine?
 Illedan: Wont tell
 Hjax: oooh a secret :D 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 600 commands...oh i thought it was 600 commands per turn for 300 turns
 Illedan: Sweeeeeet
 Illedan: :tada&lt;.
 Illedan: :tada:
 Illedan: Removing some linq helps&#160;:)
 jacek: good for you

 Illedan: what depth?
 MSmits: depth 8
 MSmits: TT doesn't seem to help much if at all
 MSmits: surprised me
 MSmits: also I am using my mcts eval, so it's not exactly optimal. I am dreading refitting all these parameters&#160;:(
 MSmits: it's really quite different when you use eval in a UCT guided search or just use it to pick the highest score one in a negamax setting
 Illedan: true
 Illedan: anyway
 Illedan: I'm off
 MSmits: my mcts bot with eval solves much sooner
 Illedan: Guess that is the end of my 2048 career
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 MSmits: huh why
 Illedan: Fun little detour
 Hjax: now give everyone else 6 months to catch up 
 Illedan: Pretty close to max
 MSmits: how do you know it's max?
 MSmits: you broke replay size?
 Illedan: Because it can't possibly spawn more numbers
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: mmh you kinda broke eulers game then
 MSmits: good optim supposed to have a soft cap
 MSmits: but you hardcapped it
 Illedan: I guess max is a few millions above this
 Illedan: But I'll accept someone beating it
 Illedan: Guess tomorrow&#160;:)
 MSmits: you mean it stopped being fun for you and you're moving on?
 Illedan: Yeah, I can see the max and have to rewrite everything to be SUPER efficient to get there
 Illedan: Can use that energy for something with more value :P
 MSmits: true, wise move then
 Illedan: I got enough value from the game for having about 8 hours of fun&#160;:)
 Hjax: its funny, most papers on 2048 are useless here
 MSmits: why is that
 Hjax: because our game isnt random 
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: except for that one random case?
 MSmits: or are all validators nonrandom?
 Hjax: idk, but one of your input parameters is the seed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: This one is still pretty good, give you some ideas on what to add to an eval... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://spartanideas.msu.edu/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/">https://spartanideas.msu.edu/2015/04/27/artificial-intelligence-has-crushed-all-human-records-in-2048-heres-how-the-ai-pulled-it-off/</a>
 Hjax: so it doesnt matter anyway 
 MSmits: ah ok
 Hjax: you can simulate the game for an arbitrary seed trivially 
 Illedan: bye
 jacek: so? just make the expectimax the nonexpectimax, it should be even easier
 MSmits: :confused:
 Hjax: yeah my point is that this game is easier than the game the papers are playing
 Hjax: most of the science the paper covers isnt super useful 
 MSmits: ah ok, for D&amp;B the reverse is true
 MSmits: most papers are about smaller board sizes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a 4x4 2048 game is still expected to end tho
 Hjax: i found a paper doing a n-tuples eval, seems like massive overkill 
 MSmits: maybe it's just enough kill? Did it perform well?
 Hjax: it did, they had like 16 million weights though
 Allis: Is that not a lot?
 Hjax: its a ton 
 MSmits: 16000
 jacek: you could try smaller ntuples
 MSmits: ton
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05085.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05085.pdf</a>
 Hjax: i never got around to writing ntuples for othello either :D 
 MSmits: me neither
 jacek: i only have them in othello and onitama for now
 MSmits: I use my code size more efficiently :P
 MSmits: with success too
 MSmits: I rank above you in onitama, but my bot loses most games
 MSmits: someone pushed me to 2
 jacek: i fear resubmiting
 Hjax: onitama is a really strong looking game 
 MSmits: you'll pull me down
 Hjax: strange*
 Hjax: ive never seen anything like it 
 MSmits: it's really quite nice
 MSmits: the sim takes some figuring out
 MSmits: even though it's not that complex
 jacek: the cards for the opponent werent obvious
 MSmits: the rotating can get confusing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm still working on beam, gheesh
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: laserbeam?
 MSmits: support beam?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I should be, got laser presents to make for GF anniversary
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no beam search
 MSmits: beam search is cool
 MSmits: I used it a few times. In contests too
 MSmits: it;s one of those algorithms that's often useful
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can only make 21,845 boards before running out of time with php
 MSmits: thats not bad
 MSmits: it's not great either, but you can do something with that
 MSmits: if you get that many sims in hypersonic, you can get to legend I think
 MSmits: I won't waste my time convincing you to try a different language though.. I know what you'll say
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so I'm dynamically choosing the top half of 64 boards, rinse and repeat until i get to max board creation timeout
 MSmits: sounds good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i free the board memory inbetween my output and reading new input, so that time doesn't seem to count against me
 Hjax: i probably wont attempt 2048, since ill be playing jrkes unofficial contest soon
 MSmits: what game is that?
 MSmits: the unofficial contest I mean
 Hjax: uh, either fantastic beasts, code of ice and fire, or tulips and daisies 
 Hjax: whatever wins the vote 
 MSmits: I see
 Hjax: fantastic bits* my bad :P
 Hjax: no copyright infringement here, no sir
 jacek: and tulips and daisies is leading
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all of which i suck at
 Hjax: i voted code of ice and fire personally 
 Hjax: looks like a nice, fun, heuristic friendly game 
 jacek: heuristic :scream:
 Hjax: im lazy, i dont want to write a search 
 MSmits: its a nice game
 Hjax: but if tulips and daisies wins i need to write a search 
 MSmits: but you kind of need a search for at least parts of it
 MSmits: for example an endgame detector
 MSmits: floodfill/bfs style
 Hjax: that kind of thing is fine
 MSmits: if you watch some replays, you'll see  them finish off with a chain
 MSmits: that's a search
 Hjax: i just mean when the whole game is, write a search and tune your eval function, it gets kind of sterile and boring imo
 Hjax: i like strategy 
 MSmits: mmh it could be a search and still has a lot of strategy
 MSmits: the strategy is in writing the evaluation, which could have many parts
 Hjax: the pr2 unofficial contest was pretty fun
 Hjax: i like games like that, if only the game had better / more fair maps

 sunksuperset370: can someone translate python to javascript
 sunksuperset370: here
 sunksuperset370: i was looking at some code and I needed to figure out what the code was doing
 sunksuperset370: python 3 is hard to understand formy puny brain
 sunksuperset370: js is easy
 sunksuperset370: any help
 Metanoob: I sent you a dm sunksuperset370
 sunksuperset370: whwhwhwhy?????
 sunksuperset370: admin?
 Metanoob: no you asked for help about translating some python3 to js
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Metanoob: do you still need some help?
 sunksuperset370: yes
 sunksuperset370: sorry took time to reply
 Metanoob: where is the code you need help with?
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/196c929e-0cb7-4ab8-9869-239e79e6457e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/196c929e-0cb7-4ab8-9869-239e79e6457e</a>
 Metanoob: no worries
 sunksuperset370: wait sorry
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/adBMez">https://codeshare.io/adBMez</a>
 sunksuperset370: the code is one the site
 Metanoob: cool I see it
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: any help
 apollodor: Hello
 sunksuperset370: hello
 sunksuperset370: metanoob
 sunksuperset370: you here
 sunksuperset370: can any one translate python 3 to js
 Metanoob: yes, I left a comment on the page of the code snippet
 Metanoob: refresh if it is not visible yet
 Metanoob: basically %2X is to print as hexadecimal number, and %02X is to add a leading 0 if the hex value is only made of 1 digit
 sunksuperset370: sorry i still can't see the coe
 sunksuperset370: code
 Metanoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16286d3f-61fd-4f70-b1a9-10065d258562">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16286d3f-61fd-4f70-b1a9-10065d258562</a>
 sunksuperset370: paste bin doesn't work right now
 Metanoob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/GAevKr">https://codeshare.io/GAevKr</a>
 Metanoob: that is one possible equivalent in js
 sunksuperset370: can you put the code in easy js
 Allis: That is easy JS. You should get familiar with bitwise shifts at some point.
 Allis: In base-10 (the number system you're used to), multiplying by 10 is a left shift of 1; same idea in binary, except it's 2 instead of 10.
 Metanoob: color channels are a bit tricky, because those are using bitwise operations to store 3 colors (and sometimes also an alpha channel) into a single 32 bit integer
 sunksuperset370:&#160;???????????
 sunksuperset370: sorry i am new to coding
 Metanoob: are we allowed to link to external resources such as a tutorial in CG chat?
 sunksuperset370: i think
 Allis: Sure, it's weird at first, but only because new programmers don't realize they have an intuitive sense of how positional number systems work, and just need to apply a bit of rigor.
 Allis: @sunksuperset370 If you had the number 1234, do you know how to extract the digit in the hundreds place (the 2)?
 sunksuperset370: var numb2 = 1234;
 Allis: What.
 sunksuperset370: console.log(numb2[1]);
 Allis: No, that wouldn't quite work; numbers aren't indexable in JS.
 Metanoob: it would work, but numb would have to be a string in that case
 sunksuperset370: ooooohhhh
 Metanoob: so, with a tiny bit of math
 sunksuperset370: var numb2 = '1234'l
 sunksuperset370:&#160;;
 Metanoob: you can extract the second digit, even if it is a number
 sunksuperset370: uuiummm
 sunksuperset370: how
 Metanoob: I believe what Allis was refering to is something called the decimal logarithm
 sunksuperset370: uuuumm oookkkkkkeeeeyyyyyy
 Metanoob: which is available through js's math api as a function called Math.log10
 sunksuperset370: i am still a noooobb at js
 sunksuperset370: still a new programmer
 sunksuperset370: in js
 sunksuperset370: don't know a lot of js though
 Metanoob: I understand maybe explaining something from one language to another might not be the best option to understand what's going on here
 sunksuperset370: i was wondering if you could tell me how js works than I would think that would help
 sunksuperset370: i know some of it
 sunksuperset370: but i am not an expert
 sunksuperset370: like if statements
 sunksuperset370: while loops
 sunksuperset370: var const let
 sunksuperset370: arrays well some of it
 sunksuperset370: mostly this is all i know
 Allis: Now apply those things you know and write some programs.
 sunksuperset370: what do i need to write the code for like what is the goal to do with the code
 Allis: Even if they're very simple programs, there's no better way to learn to code than to write code.
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Allis: Just randomly learning this and that and trying to memorize it won't be an effective learning approach. Gotta get your hands dirty.&#160;:)
 sunksuperset370: lol
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: do you want to join my clashj of code so I can see what I can do?
 sunksuperset370: allis metanoob?
 sunksuperset370: any one
 Allis: The trick is to push yourself just beyond your limit; you want to be in a position where you *almost* know everything you need to know to write the program, but then you hit a block and you need to learn something new to proceed.
 Metanoob: clash of code is a great place to start yes
 sunksuperset370: do you want to join mine
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 Metanoob: I am okay to play one round with you yes
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Metanoob: it's midnight here though so I won't stay too long
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i will create the clash
 Metanoob: how do we join the clash? will you invite us yeah?
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 Metanoob: ok cool
 sunksuperset370: allis
 sunksuperset370: can you play too
 Allis: I'm in the middle of a different Clash, but it's shortest mode so I have time.
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: i sent metanoob an invite
 sunksuperset370: i need to play with more players too
 sunksuperset370: half minte left
 Metanoob: Im in :grin:
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: :grin:
 Metanoob: wow it supports up to 100 players
 sunksuperset370: yep
 sunksuperset370: uujm
 Metanoob: do you know the modulo operator in js?
 Metanoob: it is the the operator&#160;%
 Metanoob: like +, -, * or / etc...
 sunksuperset370: yes
 Metanoob: oka
 Metanoob: y
 sunksuperset370: check this out

 sunksuperset370: need help
 sunksuperset370: shorted mode
 Allis: Oh, hey, you're my 100th follower. That's pretty neat.
 Allis: I feel like you should get a cake or something. :sweat_smile:
 sunksuperset370: ooooooh
 Metanoob: haha grats
 Allis: Danke.
 sunksuperset370: problem
 sunksuperset370: this is the code
 sunksuperset370: const N = parseInt(readline());
 sunksuperset370: let answer = ' ';
 sunksuperset370: if (!N/4) {answer = 'Ok'}else {answer = 'AAAAAAAAAA!!!'};
 sunksuperset370: why dis not work
 Metanoob: N/4 will always be different than 0, unless N is 0
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 Metanoob: 100/4 = 25
 Metanoob: however
 sunksuperset370: N can't be 0
 sunksuperset370: check constrains
 sunksuperset370: 1 &lt;= N
 sunksuperset370: so N can't be 0
 Metanoob: I understand, my point is N/4 isn't the way to check if a number is divisible by 4
 sunksuperset370: 2 mins
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Metanoob: modulo&#160;% is useful for that however
 sunksuperset370: how
 Metanoob: N%4 will tell you what the remainder is, after division
 sunksuperset370: ok
 Metanoob: if the remainder is zero, then it means than 4 was able to fit fully in N, so it is divisible by 4
 sunksuperset370: so if the remainder turns out to be an integer the answer will be aaaaa
 halworsen: N%k == 0 means N is divisible by k
 Metanoob: yes!
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: generally, N%k == a means that N=c*k+a for some integer c
 sunksuperset370: well
 Metanoob: nice job, 100% sunk
 sunksuperset370: yayayayaya
 sunksuperset370: yay
 sunksuperset370: can you do another one
 sunksuperset370: please
 Metanoob: I'm afraid I have to leave
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: can allis do it
 sunksuperset370: or halworsen
 halworsen: do what
 Metanoob: clash of code with sunk
 halworsen: sure
 Metanoob: cool, alright you have fun I'll see you around I guess&#160;:)
 sunksuperset370: i can't follow you for some reason halworsen
 halworsen: weird
 sunksuperset370: i think you should go to clash of code
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: i could follow you at least
 halworsen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14130021ae89964bdc77953de37bb32924ed360">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/14130021ae89964bdc77953de37bb32924ed360</a>
 K-: Hello World :D
 sunksuperset370: i am in
 sunksuperset370: can allis
 sunksuperset370: do this
 halworsen: dont think we're in the same lobby
 itwasmeDIO: za wordo
 sunksuperset370: nono
 halworsen: ah there
 sunksuperset370: allis
 sunksuperset370: you there
 halworsen: gl
 sunksuperset370: hurry
 Allis: Dang. I just missed it.
 sunksuperset370: i think this is going to be hard
 sunksuperset370: i can't seem to figure out what this code work
 sunksuperset370: is word a string
 sunksuperset370: how do i figure out how long the word id
 sunksuperset370: this is all so confusing
 sunksuperset370: i can't do tis
 sunksuperset370: help hep help!!!!!!
 itwasmeDIO: muda muda muda
 itwasmeDIO: MUDAAAA
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?????
 sunksuperset370: what
 sunksuperset370: oh my god halworsen
 halworsen: what language are you using
 sunksuperset370: js
 halworsen: uhh
 sunksuperset370: i am bad at this
 halworsen: i think it's word.length
 sunksuperset370: help help help
 halworsen: if you fed the input into word, that is
 halworsen: yeah
 sunksuperset370: word is input
 sunksuperset370: so word is a string
 halworsen: yeah
 halworsen: if you did const word = readline() the length is word.length
 sunksuperset370: yep
 sunksuperset370: i forgot how to write a while loop
 sunksuperset370: while ( i = word.length(word) i==0; i--){
 sunksuperset370: is this how we write a while loop
 halworsen: that looks like a for loop to me&#160;;)
 sunksuperset370: i quit
 halworsen: while loops keep running until the stuff inside () is false
 sunksuperset370: the problem is ther are some errors
 halworsen: word.length isn't a function
 halworsen: length is a property of word
 sunksuperset370:&#160;???
 halworsen: if you have word='abc', word.length is 3
 halworsen: no function call needed
 sunksuperset370: while ( i = word.length(word) i!==0; i--; {
 sunksuperset370: until i don't == to 0 i ==
 halworsen: for (let i = word.length; i == 0; i--) {	...}
 sunksuperset370: oooh
 sunksuperset370: tgere is still an error
 sunksuperset370: plus how do i get to the last letter in the string
 sunksuperset370: this is confusing
 halworsen: that's fine, it took me longer than i thought it should too
 sunksuperset370: i just quit
 sunksuperset370: lets sstart another one
 sunksuperset370: i will create it
 halworsen: sometimes writing the code is just really tough
 PatrickMcGinnisII: while ((i=readline(STDIN)).length&gt;0) {}
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;?
 halworsen: does that read 1 char at a time??
 sunksuperset370: hello
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no, I have npo idea what you are doing
 halworsen: discussing a clash
 sunksuperset370: patrick you want to join
 PatrickMcGinnisII: read a whole line at a time
 PatrickMcGinnisII: then interate over it
 halworsen: also, for future reference, you can get the last character in the string with word[word.length - 1]
 sunksuperset370: do you want to joing the clash
 halworsen: or word[word.length - 2] for the 2nd last character
 halworsen: and so on
 sunksuperset370: ANNNNYYYOONNNEEE WANT TO JOING!!!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: string.charat(n)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops
 PatrickMcGinnisII: charAt
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lookup JS email validators, looking at code is great way to learn
 halworsen: sounds like a one way ticket to regexes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, don't use regex ... very slooow
 sunksuperset370: well i don't know

 sunksuperset370: why is this crap not working!!QQQ!!!
 sunksuperset370: while (N &lt;=0)
 sunksuperset370: {n--;
 sunksuperset370: out= w;
 halworsen: so
 sunksuperset370: console.log(out);}
 halworsen: N is how many times to repeat it right, so N is gonna be &gt; 0
 sunksuperset370: yes
 halworsen: at least at the start
 halworsen: and you want to loop N times
 halworsen: but N &lt;= 0 is false, so the while loop won't run like that
 sunksuperset370: wel i changed it to just a &gt;
 halworsen: yep, that's correct
 halworsen: also remember that variables are case sensitive
 sunksuperset370: still don't work
 halworsen: N and n are not the same
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, while(out.length&gt;0) {out=substr(out,-1); console.log(out);}
 halworsen: na this is a different clash
 halworsen: you get N and a word then print the word N times on different lines
 sunksuperset370: i got it
 halworsen: niiice
 halworsen: good job
 sunksuperset370: i just had to change the first const to a var
 sunksuperset370: lol
 sunksuperset370: didn't notice that
 sunksuperset370: another one?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll shutup, my suggestions are all wrong anyways
 halworsen: sure
 halworsen: lmao
 halworsen: not wrong, you just dont have the context :p
 sunksuperset370: what does Imao
 sunksuperset370: mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: roflmao
 sunksuperset370: wait never ming
 sunksuperset370: how do we do this one
 sunksuperset370: is this binary
 halworsen: nope
 halworsen: the first line tells you how many numbers you get
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: the second line is a list of numbers separated by spaces yeah?
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 halworsen: and each number is the ASCII code for a character
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what's the name of the clash?
 sunksuperset370: fasted mode
 halworsen: idk i finished it
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: this is really confusing
 sunksuperset370: i don't know ASCII
 halworsen: ASCII is a text encoding
 sunksuperset370: i don't know that encoding
 sunksuperset370: if i don't know this i can't do it then
 sunksuperset370: i q

 Allis: @sunksuperset370 That's gonna be a huge problem.
 LastRick: Any mods on that could send me Validator 3 and/or 4 for Logically Reasonable Inequalities, would be much appreciated. Can pass all tests but can't get by those. Thanks.
 halworsen: i mean
 halworsen: yes, if you keep giving up that's not good, but some clashes don't really fit for beginners
 sunksuperset370: well i am a beginner
 halworsen: also, sunk, ASCII is basically just taking a letter in the alphabet and turning it into a number
 Allis: I more meant the whole self-starting thing. Being able to learn without being forced to is kind of a superpower.
 sunksuperset370: so i guess i am going to blow my ass away in everything I I don't work u
 sunksuperset370: up
 halworsen: so the clash is asking you to turn those numbers back into letters
 sunksuperset370: yes and i don't know Ascii
 halworsen: very often you'll have functions that can translate back and forth for you
 Allis: But you could! It's not a secret.
 sunksuperset370: can you join my clash
 sunksuperset370: allis
 sunksuperset370: &gt;
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 sunksuperset370: can you join too
 Allis: The rated ones are more exciting.&#160;:/
 sunksuperset370: hhhm
 halworsen: lol
 sunksuperset370: can you joing allis
 sunksuperset370: please
 halworsen: i wonder why you would find them more exciting... hmmm
 sunksuperset370: AAAALLLLIIIISSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
 sunksuperset370: look in your notification box
 PatrickMcGinnisII: String.fromCharCode(ascii_code)
 sunksuperset370: join
 halworsen: sounds about right patrick
 sunksuperset370: never mind
 sunksuperset370: help
 halworsen: what do you have so far
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7a205b58-e2e8-4f88-9286-f80ce07fa780">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7a205b58-e2e8-4f88-9286-f80ce07fa780</a>
 sunksuperset370: nono
 halworsen: just paste it directly into chat
 halworsen: the pastebins don't seem to work
 sunksuperset370: i am put the paste bin shit is getting gin the way
 sunksuperset370: i can't do it
 sunksuperset370: i type in control V
 sunksuperset370: but the thing thinks i am using paste bin
 sunksuperset370: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/2jBLLM">https://codeshare.io/2jBLLM</a>
 sunksuperset370: here
 halworsen: what lol, does codingame put your code in a pastebin automatically?
 sunksuperset370: this is the code so far
 sunksuperset370: yes
 sunksuperset370: it does
 halworsen: cool
 halworsen: ok anyways
 halworsen: so A is the word you wanna wrap in stars
 sunksuperset370: yes yes i know
 halworsen: and on the line with the word you have something like * word *
 sunksuperset370: but this should at lease log the second line
 sunksuperset370: but the thing logs nothing
 halworsen: ok so first off word.length isn't a function
 halworsen: it's just let Star = word.length + 4;
 sunksuperset370: how do i use the thing then
 sunksuperset370: word.length wont work
 sunksuperset370: what is the thing taking the length from
 halworsen: let sTar = is a syntax error
 halworsen: oh right you called it A
 halworsen: it's A.length + 4
 halworsen: if you have a string and you read it by const inp = readline() it's length is inp.length
 halworsen: or if you do const bean = readline() it's bean.length
 halworsen: yea?
 sunksuperset370: okok
 halworsen: let sTaR = is a syntax error, you can remove that line
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aba48be8-e846-467f-8342-284ee027bb25">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/aba48be8-e846-467f-8342-284ee027bb25</a>
 sunksuperset370: now how do i put in the amount of starts rather than longing in a number
 halworsen: bruh
 halworsen: ok so in javascript
 halworsen: strings have a function called repeat
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: so you can do '*'.repeat(n) to repeat * n times
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: e.g. '*'.repeat(5) gets you '*****'
 sunksuperset370: so '*'.repeat(Star)l
 halworsen: yes
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: well that worked
 halworsen: nice
 halworsen: gj
 sunksuperset370: another one but with more people this time?
 halworsen: i can do 1 more but i'm heading off after
 sunksuperset370: ok
 sunksuperset370: any one else want to join
 sunksuperset370: 3
 sunksuperset370: 2
 sunksuperset370: 1
 sunksuperset370: uuuummm
 sunksuperset370: any help here
 sunksuperset370: how do i vise versa a capitalization
 sunksuperset370: help
 sunksuperset370: help
 sunksuperset370: help
 halworsen: string.toUpperCase()
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 halworsen: or string.toLowerCase()
 halworsen: 'a'.toUpperCase() =&gt; 'A'
 halworsen: 'A'.toLowerCase() =&gt; 'a'
 sunksuperset370: how do i check if a letter is lowercase or uppercase
 halworsen: hint: 'a'.toUpperCase() =&gt; 'a'
 halworsen: oops
 halworsen: 'A'.toUpperCase() =&gt; 'A'
 halworsen: is what i meant
 sunksuperset370: i don't get it
 halworsen: in the same vein, 'a'.toLowerCase() =&gt; 'a'
 sunksuperset370: i am really confused
 sunksuperset370: how how how
 halworsen: what happens when you take the upper case of a upper case letter compared to when you take the upper case of a lower case letter
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 halworsen: the upper case of 'A' is 'A', yeah?
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 halworsen: and the upper case of 'a' is 'A'
 sunksuperset370: yeah
 halworsen: mhm
 halworsen: there's a difference there you can use
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?

 PatrickMcGinnisII: google is your friend
 sunksuperset370: uuum
 halworsen: was trying to lead you onto the answer but google is also cool lol
 sunksuperset370: can i figure out stuff while keeping google out of this
 sunksuperset370: google isn't what i want to go off of
 sunksuperset370: if i did i would have done so a long time ago
 sunksuperset370: i need to ask real people for help
 sunksuperset370: sorry patrick
 Allis: @sunksuperset370 That's a really silly mindset. You're not just gonna magically know stuff.
 sunksuperset370: i know
 Allis: Learn how to learn; it's a remarkably valuable skill.
 sunksuperset370: lol
 sunksuperset370: will
 sunksuperset370: well
 PatrickMcGinnisII: start with built in functions like  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String</a>
 sunksuperset370: the problem here is that google isn't always right
 halworsen: there are some problems where googling the answer is justified
 halworsen: and there are some problems where you stand to learn a lot by arriving at the answer by yourself
 Allis: Googling to just find an immediate answer to the problem isn't what's being suggested.
 sunksuperset370: can i please know what is the topic question I asked was
 sunksuperset370: i thought i was shouting help help help
 sunksuperset370: sorry
 halworsen: it's a string manipulation problem
 sunksuperset370: didn't mean to be a jerk
 PatrickMcGinnisII: How do i vice versa a capitalization
 halworsen: that's a broad subject so you won't really find this problem by just searching for that but that's the family of problems it belongs in
 sunksuperset370: well
 sunksuperset370: 3 mins left
 DarkDev: #C#
 sunksuperset370: i need to know how i did so far
 halworsen: thing i was going for was that if you take the upper case letter of an upper case letter, it doesn't change
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: but if you take the upper case of a lower case letter, it does change
 sunksuperset370: ok
 halworsen: so you can check if the character changes to know if it was upper or lower case
 DarkDev: @lua
 sunksuperset370:&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: c=(c==c.toLowerCase()?c.toUpperCase:c.toLowerCase);
 halworsen: ternary might be a bit beyond this level
 halworsen: anyways, c===c.toLowerCase() means c is lower case
 halworsen: c===c.toUpperCase() means c is upper case
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't google tho, i answered his Q
 sunksuperset370: well timed out
 halworsen: sunk, i suggest you go look at the puzzles, it's nice not to have a time limit hanging over you while learning basics
 halworsen: don't be afraid to google for hints if you really are stuck, but you should make sure you've tried to solve the problem using what you already know first
 PatrickMcGinnisII: sunksuperset370 find a searchable function url like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://devdocs.io/javascript/">https://devdocs.io/javascript/</a> whre you can easily see the function prtotypes to refer to
 sunksuperset370: sorry about being a jerk
 sunksuperset370: thx you all
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and a bunch of IDEs have function prototype built in for you.  i do JS in Notepad++, i think it does do a little error checking, but u still need access to the prototypes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think people recommend intelliJ
 sunksuperset370: well i was thinking if i should learn c++
 PatrickMcGinnisII: console.log everything , before and after var manipulations to really visualize what u did
 sunksuperset370: ok thx
 sunksuperset370: well i think i should work on some other puzzle
 sunksuperset370: welli think ishould leave bye
 sunksuperset370: see you tommorrrow
 DarkDev: Does anyone know C#
 LegendaryStone: Allis do you mind sharing your code?
 LegendaryStone: :pensive:
 LeopoldFitz: You can show your code
 UnPlugThaMatrix: im looking for a gf
 LinhT.Nguyen: same
 LinhT.Nguyen: any programmer model here
 LinhT.Nguyen: i want to persuade you to become my gf
 LinhT.Nguyen: sounds good
 Majeck: LinhT.Nguyen hahaha
 Majeck: Being alone in quarantine is no fun
 Majeck: I'm actually madly in love with a girl on here
 Zenoscave: That's not cringey at all...
 Majeck: Mostly because she's always beating me by like 10 points in any competition I try
 Majeck: Zenoscave I know, I'm completely pathetic
 Zenoscave: Then change.
 Majeck: I mean
 Majeck: What's the harm lol
 Majeck: I'll never see her in real life
 Zenoscave: but still your sentence is offputting.
 Zenoscave: this general chat is not the place for that
 Majeck: Sorry what I meant to say was that I was completely obsessed over a girl here
 Zenoscave: doesn't help..
 Majeck: My whole life has been consumed by a fictional account
 Majeck: I do nothing all day but refresh her page in the hopes that she has responded to my 87th message
 Majeck: My parents are thinking about dis-adopting me
 Majeck: But I don't care for I am completely enchanted
 Majeck: Is that less cringe Zeno?
 Zenoscave: sure sounds good now
 Majeck: Fiufff
 Majeck: I was worried I was being a little crazy but now I know that I'm being completely normal
 UnPlugThaMatrix: what if the acc is a bot lol
 UnPlugThaMatrix: ir prob is a thot bot
 UnPlugThaMatrix: *it
 Zenoscave: nah, only bot is Automaton2000 and AutomatonNN
 Automaton2000: but your bot is worse
 Zenoscave: lol
 Majeck: UnPlugThaMatrix noooooo
 Majeck: I hadn't even considered that hahaha
 Majeck: Well I guess every morning I'll have to help her pass her captchas
 Majeck: (Zeno all of this is satire)
 Zenoscave: (i figured that out after a bit...)
 Zenoscave: (just slightly slow)
 Majeck: My whole life is a satire
 Niicide: lol
 LeopoldFitz: No, you are miracle.Just turst yourself.
 Niicide: your mom p**** is a miracle
 Majeck: Hey language
 LinhT.Nguyen: hahaha its ok to be in love
 Unkmar: I was tired, so I just satire.
 LinhT.Nguyen: lmao

 Rebollo: Hi experts: Do you guys know, even though, we are printing something in the result (c++ / COUT) it shows "Nothing" estead of the result?
 Rebollo: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5233aa13-87ab-4842-9c41-8ee4fa9293da">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5233aa13-87ab-4842-9c41-8ee4fa9293da</a>
 Rebollo: Using like that
 Rebollo: std::cout &lt;&lt; finalString &lt;&lt; endl;
 5DN1L: Have you double-checked the completeness of your finalString?
 Bon[]Crayon: Happy New Year! #world
 5DN1L: Happy New Year everyone
 Rebollo: I did not understand..it is being shown in&#160;:Standard Output Stream:00000001 000073af
 Rebollo: HNY guys
 Rebollo: How would I check the completeness?
 Rebollo: Show I print the quotes? as well?
 5DN1L: If your finalString consists of just those two strings of numbers, but the answer consists more strings of numebrs, then your answer is incomplete
 5DN1L: consists of*
 5DN1L: numbers*
 Rebollo: Expected: "00000083 000000e5"
 Rebollo: Standard Output Stream:00000001 000073af
 Rebollo: FailureFound: Nothing
 Rebollo: DDo i havve to print the quotes as well maybe?
 5DN1L: is it test case 1?
 Rebollo: one
 5DN1L: you can see the full expected answer. do you know how to do that?
 Rebollo: no
 5DN1L: there should be icon like this:
 5DN1L: . ____
 5DN1L: . ____
 5DN1L: . ____
 5DN1L: click it
 5DN1L: somewhere near the SUBMIT button
 Rebollo: I see
 Rebollo: perfect
 Rebollo: thank you
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Rebollo: I am trying nintendo crypto, I you guys have any clue
 Rebollo: seems to be so hard
 Rebollo: if*
 5DN1L: that puzzle is classified as "Very Hard"
 Rebollo: I know I prefer these, I don´t care if I take a 100 years to finish..I go step by step a learning the concepts and things like that..
 Rebollo: But this one seems to be another level..
 Rebollo: Maybe Super Extra Hard
 isimkullanmiyorum: hELlo
 baneetparmar: echo "Happy New Year World!!!"
 5DN1L: Rebollo read the forum thread. it may give you some inspiration: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/nintendo-challenge/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/nintendo-challenge/</a>
 Rebollo: Thank you
 Rebollo: I could finish Shdows of Knight ||, which is very hard, in about a week..
 Rebollo: But this
 Rebollo: Is more than very hard

 Rebollo: Thank you
 Rebollo: I ll solve this year
 5DN1L: Hmmm, that youtube link hasn't been mentioned by anyone in the forum yet
 Rebollo: I think no one has accomplished 100% yet
 5DN1L: 23234 have started, 516 have finished
 Rebollo: 100%?
 5DN1L: finished means 100%, yes
 Rebollo: nice
 Rebollo: Have you seen this youtube video before? Is it cheating wachting it?
 5DN1L: I've never watched it myself. Maybe you just watch the first few minutes just to give yourself some hints
 5DN1L: It's an hour long
 Rebollo: yes that´s what ´have done
 Rebollo: I try to think by my self maybe
 Rebollo: he is getting into the details too much
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Thorcode: wow rebollo how could you solve the shadow 2, I got alot of problem solving it
 Rebollo: At first glace it was mega hard
 Rebollo: But I have not applied a very nice solution
 Rebollo: I did simple binary seaarch for y first
 Rebollo: and then for x
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 Thorcode: I mean the unknown how do you handle it
 Rebollo: sorry what you mean?
 Thorcode: when the bomb_dir is unknown bro
 Thorcode: how could you jump
 Rebollo: the bomb dir is unknow only before the first jup right?
 Thorcode: yep just for the first turn
 Rebollo: So i jumped aanyway, mirroring my position
 Thorcode: and how do you binary search for the y?
 Thorcode: while we have no position of the bomb?
 Rebollo: In the first round I did an exception and jump to the mirror position, like&gt; y = H - y
 Rebollo: doing that I already divided the map by 2
 Thorcode: ah thanks bro that's helpful
 Rebollo: the next rounds
 Rebollo: I have updated the TOP Limit and Bottom limit
 Rebollo: Always dividing the size by two
 Rebollo: example
 Thorcode: ah nice method I could apply like that too
 Rebollo: if my direction is TOP &gt; DOWN and the bombDir is "WARMER":I update the TOPLIMIT to my (current position + my last position) /2 
 Rebollo: keep the Botton limit as it is
 Rebollo: And jump to (Current Top Limit + Botton Limit) /2
 Rebollo: And so on
 Thorcode: Thanks rebollo alot I think I could binary now
 Thorcode: thanks for the hint it is very useful
 Rebollo: I used to do binary search at work..it´s a programming language called ABAP from SAP..and it is  always necessaary to do binary to improve search performance..in a (in-memory) dataa set 
 Rebollo: so first sort the table and after that do a binary by dividing in HALF till you fin the record..
 Rebollo: NP
 Vamsi_kvk_: hi
 Trucifer: hi
 PresidentZeus: In bender EP. 1, is the direction priority circular/dynamic? Like, if it can't go north, it tries west, instead of SOUTH, EAST NORTH WEST?
 5DN1L: Check the behaviour against the test cases and you will know the answer. Also the priorities change if an inverter is encountered
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: there is no bender ep1
 5DN1L: it's a blunder now
 eulerscheZahl: there's still Bender 4, making the name total nonsense now&#160;:(
 JBM: renamed or removed?
 5DN1L: Bender is now Blunder
 5DN1L: renamed
 JBM: like, SRLSLY
 JBM: i'd read that as a joke
 JBM: well ok we could have seen it coming
 JBM: startup days: just produce contents, who cares the ownership
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: they are cleaning it up to spin it off.  not in the core path
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: binarysearch might buy them
 Nixerrr: Why do some people pick C over C++ for bot programming? Could there be any valid reason or just personal preference?
 Nixerrr: Trying to decide if I want to get into C or C++ :thinking:
 Nixerrr: I'm drawn to C - it feels like punk rock lol
 MSmits: yeah it makes sense, if you're already using c++, why not make things worse?
 Nixerrr: I haven't used either much
 EsthiYU: recommend C++. It is the most performance-savvy programming language choice. All AI-powered Chatbot algorithms can be written fully with C++. ... When you need to go fast to complete a project C++ comes as the best choice.
 MSmits: rust is just as fast apparently
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: if you are talking jobs, employers see C++ on a resume and assume you can do C as well.  but not the other way around
 Nixerrr: No, I just want to have fun on CG
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: then clojure is best
 MSmits: if you want fast bots, just stick with c++ 
 MSmits: no reason to go C 
 MSmits: if you really like C, then just use c++ as if it was C
 MSmits: c++ is basically a superset of c anyways
 Nixerrr: Right right
 MSmits: i don't really like coding in C++, but it's fast and I don't know rust
 Nixerrr: What do you enjoy, MSmits?
 MSmits: C#/python
 MSmits: python for small projects
 BlaiseEbuth: Clojure &lt;3
 MSmits: he wants a fast language
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do you speak about python so&#160;?
 MSmits: he asked what I enjoyed
 MSmits: his original question was about fast languages i mean
 MSmits: it's sad that there aren't many choices there
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. tl;dr
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I'd love to see fortran added
 MSmits: fortran is a dead language isnt it?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: some folks use it, and it is super fast
 Nixerrr: CSB was renamed? :O
 Astrobytes: Blunder?!
 Astrobytes: also, hi
 MSmits: everything that has any relation to a trademark gets renamed
 MSmits: hi
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I would have voted for Brenda
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Nixerrr: Ah okay, makes sense
 Nixerrr: Is 'Mad' a tip of the hat to a certain user? :laughing:
 MSmits: i think it's an irrational fear of litigation but i am no lawyer. I don't think anyone pressing charges would have had a good case
 Astrobytes: IP law is weird though
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: nah, the puzzles are IP they'll probably sell off.  cleaning it up makes sense
 MSmits: isn't it just parody?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: To me, everything but scrabble seems like fair use.  But IANAL
 MSmits: my guess is it is cheaper to change the names than to pay lawyers to go over everything and check it
 Astrobytes: ^
 BlaiseEbuth: If their concern was about saving money they'd have fired a certain useless employee long ago. Result would be the same, but cheaper. :smirk:
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: yep.  they'll probably sell everything but clash and hiring to binarysearch or miniclip.  probably bring around 200k
 willdrinkyourblood: i ran into an issue... it says that "Index was outside the bounds of the array." but it points me to a line with a single semicolon, when i compile the code with something else it works perfectly, but not here. why could that be?
 MSmits: you're using a negative index to your array or one that is equal larger than the length of the array
 willdrinkyourblood: no i'm not
 willdrinkyourblood: wouldn't there be an issue when i compile the code elsewhere too then?
 MSmits: sometimes compiles fix your errors for you
 MSmits: compilers
 MSmits: so you have an error that CG doesn't fix for you I am afraid
 MSmits: which language?/
 willdrinkyourblood: the error bit of code is right at the beginning, the length of the array and the inputs are given by codingame... why would the input something with a mistake?
 willdrinkyourblood: c#
 Astrobytes: Paste your code here and Smits will fix it
 willdrinkyourblood: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80d861e1-cca5-4a3e-af6d-6ac2a1b3cc58">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/80d861e1-cca5-4a3e-af6d-6ac2a1b3cc58</a>
 MSmits: ehh not too great at fixing people's code :P
 willdrinkyourblood: lmao
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: i,j backwards
 Astrobytes:  Ithink you swapped your w and h
 willdrinkyourblood: lol hold on
 Astrobytes: (i &amp; j, same thing
 Astrobytes: )
 MSmits: yeah width and height
 MSmits: that would give your index problem
 willdrinkyourblood: same error :thumbsup_tone1:
 willdrinkyourblood: oh wait no
 jacek: you do C# and you dont C the error?
 willdrinkyourblood: all good except i got a mistake elsewhere :thumbsup_tone1:thank you tho&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: happy debugging&#160;:)
 MSmits: np
 willdrinkyourblood: jacek you just destroyed me
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: willdrinkyourblood you know why other people cannot do this as well as jacek can?
 MSmits: their insults lack polish
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: Not bad, not bad :D
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 willdrinkyourblood: lmao
 Nixerrr: Whose solo puzzles are good quality? Recommend me some please
 MSmits: java coffee cup&#160;?
 MSmits: if i got that right
 Nixerrr: :ok_hand:
 Astrobytes: anything by euler
 MSmits: yeah ofc, i was assuming you did those already
 Astrobytes: sorry, "yooler shezzal"
 MSmits: but eulers are hard
 MSmits: rofl
 Nixerrr: Yeah, I'm looking at the easy ones n
 Nixerrr: *now
 MSmits: I'm definitely calling him that now
 Nixerrr: I've found a C handbook in one of the moving boxes, so C it is!

 Nixerrr: Yup, a few months ago but we haven't got a lot of furniture yet haha
 Astrobytes: lol, using boxes as desks :D
 Astrobytes: jacek: lol
 MSmits: that link is weird, how do you do that

 Madara-Uchiha: hey what is the level can i chat
 Madara-Uchiha: i can only chat when i level up
 Nat-42: Hey, um... clash of code, I might have just cheated without thinking about it
 Nat-42: if say a fastest wins problem needs a prime test as part of the answer, and I copypaste a prime test, is that cheating?
 ethaneCH3CH3: print("Hello world!")
 gjin25: Hello the World
 xxd: struct it is mostly QOL things like slices, explicit allocations, powerful compile-time execution 
 xxd: all things that are still possible to code efficiently without
 struct: I see, I have never heard about Zig so was wondering
 struct: Do you have any bot here that uses mcts?
 Yalheim: Is there a difference between clashing  4vs  or 8 vs  ? 
 struct: the elo will change Yalheim
 struct: Because its based on all players
 struct: Im not sure how true skill formula works though
 Yalheim: so if i win a 8vs i get more exp?
 struct: probably
 struct: but its based on the ranks of the other players
 struct: if you play vs 4 people that are top 100 you will get more than you would get from winning vs 8 that are &gt; 10000
 xxd: struct: I do have two but I am not the best optimizer
 xxd: i have a connect4 at 33rd in wood 1 and a tictactoe at around 150th in legend
 cegprakash: hi can someone suggest me a good codingame AI puzzle that I can use to teach ppl about AI in a live presentation?
 derjack: search race? single player csb
 cegprakash: mm no opponents in search race so kinda boring :P 
 cegprakash: I will mostly do CSB 
 Thorcode: the thing is csb only need -3vel to get to gold :money_mouth:
 Thorcode: some of your student could learn this gold method and bam got to gold
 Thorcode: and -3vel is easy to understand
 Thorcode: i've just help a guy to learn -3vel
 MrCodeGuy: hi
 Murat_Eroglu: What is -3vel?
 MrCodeGuy: same
 MrCodeGuy: what is -3vel though?
 Thorcode: basically you velocity is caculate by your current position and your pass position
 MrCodeGuy: whats velocity?
 Thorcode: google
 MrCodeGuy: so basically everything in the universe? because thats google XDDDD
 Thorcode: in csb you make a var to store your velocity and make a vara= your checkpoint x and y - 3*vel
 Thorcode: that's all about -3vel
 MrCodeGuy: WTH
 Uljahn: it's a well-known cheat to skip the tutorial leagues in Mad Pod Racing, but you'll learn nothing in return
 MrCodeGuy: bruh im in high still hadent heard about it
 Thorcode: yep
 MrCodeGuy: high school i mean
 Thorcode: velocity is a speed of something in a given direction.
 Thorcode: lmao
 MrCodeGuy: oh ok
 Thorcode: I though this was learnt in physic grade 7th
 MrCodeGuy: oh
 MrCodeGuy: i skipped 7th grade
 Thorcode: or 8th grade i don't really remeber
 MrCodeGuy: oh
 Murat_Eroglu: Is "var a" the output?
 Thorcode: yep
 Murat_Eroglu: How about the thrust?
 Thorcode: depend on you lmao
 MrCodeGuy: no one: c, c+, c++, c+++
 Murat_Eroglu: Ok thanks
 Thorcode: also it is the same as the wood 3-1 in thrust to get to gold
 H.Curry: :innocent:
 blaze345: demmy in the house
 Wontonimo: man, that took too much effort
 struct: Wontonimo you can press arrow up to repeat last message in chat
 struct: You only missed a 5 in the first taco
 struct: last message you typed
 Ben5: and thanks for the taco i guess
 Johnluigi: guys can someone make a function that returns an array with all leap years between 1801 to 2401; btw is code golf so basicly with 60 carachters in javascript
 5DN1L: So that you can copy and paste?
 Johnluigi: i already have one but have to many carachters
 5DN1L: show it
 Johnluigi: n=&gt;{d=[];for(i=1804;i&lt;2401;i+=4)i%50|i%80==0?d.push(i):0;return d}
 struct: if it was ruby I would know how to do the start
 struct: [*1801..2401]...
 Johnluigi: it needs to be in javascript
 struct: ==0
 struct: &lt;1
 Johnluigi: wow
 Johnluigi: thats good
 Johnluigi: unfortunately not enough
 StraumliPerversion: :taco: [CG]Thibaud
 antiwonto: [auto] StraumliPerversion has awarded [CG]Thibaud 4 tacos. [CG]Thibaud now has 7 taco. StraumliPerversion now has 31 taco
 Johnluigi: does someone have a better solution?
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 171 taco. jacek now has 105 taco
 Johnluigi: 5DN1L did you try?
 Mindarius: I'm trying to do horse-race bash, but I can't figure out how to optimize it. bash's sort method is fast enough on its own, but adding a loop comparing each set of neighbors makes it too long
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Mindarius, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 4 tacos
 Mindarius: presently tried checks in a bubble-sort format (just comparisons, no sort), still goes over, which, it's bubble, that's to be expected
 Mindarius: The hint basically says my first guess was right
 Mindarius: which is annoying
 Mindarius: because it means I probably need to make my own fancy sort in bash
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 CrypticMatrix_By_NIght: qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
 CrypticMatrix_By_NIght: I just started using this
 CrypticMatrix_By_NIght: I have no idea of what to do
 CrypticMatrix_By_NIght: Just checking things out.
 Mindarius: playing clash of code is a pretty common start
 UZUHAMA: Or go to practice section and solve some puzzles
 Mindarius: true, clash of code is generally easier though. I wasn't sure how new to programming they were.
 UZUHAMA: Yes, but when I first played clash of code, I wasn't able to finish it in time
 UZUHAMA: Because I didn't even knew how input/output worked
 joniebear: What's the highest score you can get on the certification tests? 
 Wontonimo: 11
 kindergarden-graduate: How to use BOOST in the race?
 Thorcode: print (x y BOOST)

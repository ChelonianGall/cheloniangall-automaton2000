 Darleanow: hello,
 Darleanow: can someone explain why the list b changes&#160;?
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6d37366d-c337-44cc-a1c3-2ec6836ca15d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6d37366d-c337-44cc-a1c3-2ec6836ca15d</a>
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/ZTHaKF5q">https://pastebin.com/ZTHaKF5q</a>
 Darleanow: b is basically [0,0] and then [1,0] then [1,1]
 j4at: cg's pastebin doesn't work
 Darleanow: yeah, theres a link right under&#160;:)
 j4at: okay i just wokeup. I'm blind rn&#160;:)
 Darleanow: xD
 Darleanow: np fam&#160;:)
 Darleanow: ok it's fixed
 Darleanow: if b[i]=="0":
 Darleanow: this was the proble√π
 Darleanow: and i can't know why
 Darleanow: so i replaced this by a counter that i set back to 0 at the end of iter
 j4at: so changing tempres is changing b
 Darleanow: and if i cahnge a value i +1 the counter
 Darleanow: tempres=b
 j4at: because they are the same list
 Darleanow: tempres is a pointer to b 
 Darleanow: right&#160;?
 j4at: well, there is no pointers is python. But = never creates a copy of an object it just reference it
 Darleanow: ik that there are no pointers, but is it considered like so&#160;?
 Darleanow: wdym by referencing it&#160;?

 Darleanow: thanks uljahn
 Darleanow:&#160;:)
 Darleanow: f=g[:]
 Darleanow: something like this would word&#160;?
 Darleanow: copy() function xD
 Uljahn: guess it makes a shallow copy, and you might need a deep copy sometimes
 j4at: yeah that would work
 j4at: there is .copy()
 j4at: in this case atleast
 Darleanow: deepcopy is work complex data structures
 Darleanow: for*
 j4at: from copy import deepcopy
 j4at: f = deepcopy(g)
 Darleanow: yeah ik&#160;:), but an exmaple of a complex data structure 
 j4at: but you don't need it in this case
 Darleanow: i know&#160;! i solved it already :p
 j4at: Well, you also need to know when it is creating a new object or not, everything is a nobject in python including int, float, strings ...
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/618219db-578d-4cf8-90a0-7f71b0eac81c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/618219db-578d-4cf8-90a0-7f71b0eac81c</a>
 aCat: hello
 Darleanow: hey
 aCat: just checking
 j4at: A = 1B = AB += 1
 aCat: HOLD THE EXECTUTION!
 j4at: print(A,B) # output: "1 2"
 j4at: because += creates a new object
 Darleanow: ok so a basic b+=0 would create a new object
 j4at: well you don't need to really do that with ints because everything creates a new object
 j4at: same case with all immutable objects
 j4at: b = b+0; would create a new object; b = b*1 too
 j4at: you really don't need to worry about int, strings, tuples at all
 Darleanow: kk ty&#160;:)
 j4at: also float and other types..&#160;:)

 jacek: at least 10359.64
 j4at: bruh
 jacek: you must defeat that rustian
 j4at: My NN best score is about 11000. I use the best game that my NN that's why I got 10880. I can use whatever language to prove my dominance.
 j4at: that my NN  plays*
 j4at: what language do you recommend&#160;?
 jacek: vb.net ;d
 j4at: I will do&#160;:) After my NN finish training

 Darleanow: Hey everyone&#160;:)
 Darleanow: guys, i don't understand
 Darleanow: how people can solve thor in 50 chars
 Darleanow: even with the golf 
 Mortis_666: they hardcoded the solutions
 Darleanow: :o
 j4at: 72 chars in Python :sunglasses:
 Darleanow: 82 :p
 Darleanow: i'll just harcode 
 Darleanow: i'll try **
 Mortis_666: 61 chars in python with hardcode solution
 j4at: It's kinda waste of time tho. I used 1 trick you don't to keep track of the horizontal position. 
 j4at: don't need*
 Darleanow: Mortis, for the hardcoded one, u did something to get the case test, the  u print a loc *n times?
 j4at: validators are the same as test cases
 j4at: you can just print lightX lightY initialTX initialTY
 Mortis_666: the validators isnt same as the test case
 j4at: ow
 Darleanow: bruh, u litteraly have to guess it xD
 j4at: yeha they are different
 j4at: but you can read their names
 j4at: 2nd is north and 1st is straight line
 j4at: and 4th is optimal angle
 Darleanow: indee
 Darleanow: got the second
 Darleanow: but can't send anymore kekw
 Darleanow: hardcoding the first two is easy
 Darleanow: but the last two is hard as hell :o
 j4at: optimal angle is easy
 Darleanow: not hard, looooong
 j4at: nvm I misunderstood what optimal angle means :upside_down:
 derjack: they change it periodically but sometimes validators dont have SW or NE

 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Looking for puzzles that focus on OOP
 Aldoggen: I hope you're not working in python. you'd be focusing on POOP then
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Nah C++
 Nikanameu: you can code everything with OOP
 Nikanameu: object a + object b instead of a+b
 Aldoggen: for death first search I implemented a graph class
 Aldoggen: you could do that one

 carruca: hi
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Hello
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Are we able to upload our own puzzles?
 struct: yes
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Oh
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: So we make a suggestion for that and the community will decide if that will be added or not?
 Aldoggen: yes
 Aldoggen: you need to be a higher level to suggest things though
 5DN1L: it's not just to suggest, but to actually create the puzzle itself
 Aldoggen: right
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Ahh that is so cool 
 Aldoggen: you have full creative control, except the community won't approve it if it isn't good enough of course
 5DN1L: well... :thinking:
 5DN1L: let's say there are unfortunate instances
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: I actually really like that idea as I have seen other sites where they just let people post w/e they want and it just ends up with a lot of low quality stuff
 Aldoggen: here you still get the occasional low-quality approved puzzle
 Aldoggen: but at least they're solvable
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Even if there are some it is definitely better to have a filter than not to have a filter
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: true
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Also, there is no way to search the puzzles by their tags?

 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: ahhh I see
 jacek: of the chat. forever
 Aldoggen: wow. I'm beating literally everyone in wood 2 in line racing
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Thanks for the link it is super useful
 Aldoggen: lol jacek
 5DN1L: jacek, i don't know you've become the spokesperson of CG :scream:
 Aldoggen: it's true isn't it?
 Aldoggen: for as long as the chat will remain, you'll be a chat mod
 5DN1L: maybe i'll get fired before the chat dies
 Aldoggen: lol
 noooooooooooooooooooooooo: Haha will it be my fault xD
 Aldoggen: I'm rank 1 in wood 2, and the battles are only half done lo
 5DN1L: yeah, let's blame it on the new guy :smirk:

 Licantf: @Aldoggen, how is your solution?
 Unionize: Hi, i just did a Clash and even if my formula is correct that was not correct for the last test even if others players, in different langage, used the same formula. It was JS for me, is there someone who can explain me what's the difference in JS who caused this problem&#160;?
 Aldoggen: your bots have a tendency to want to go downwards lol 
 Aldoggen: Licantf I don't have one right now. show me your code and I'll help you
 Aldoggen: maybe do it in private chat
 Aldoggen: jacek euler keeps blowing you up lol
 Razerk: Hello I'm stucked in the puzzle (mad-pod-racing) where i need to change the power of the pod. I tried to put " + thrust" in the same consolelog than the x + y positions but not working. I have no clue to find the solution ..
 5DN1L: what's the line of code you're using?
 Razerk:     console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' 50' );This&#160;?
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: it looks all right to me
 5DN1L: what do you mean by not working?
 5DN1L: not beating the boss?
 5DN1L: or code error?
 Razerk: But now i want to add the "thrust"
 jacek: no space between X and Y
 5DN1L: oh
 5DN1L: the number is the thrust
 5DN1L: so in your example, thrust = 50
 BlaiseEbuth: Fix your reading jacek
 jacek: oh
 Astrobytes: ezpz
 Aldoggen: though there is no space between Y and thrust
 Aldoggen: wait
 5DN1L: there is
 jacek: huh
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 5DN1L: you guys
 Aldoggen: I need to fix my reading too
 5DN1L: all need glasses lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Use my starter, go legend
 5DN1L: :nerd:
 Razerk:  console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + ' 50' + ' 80');
 5DN1L: no
 Aldoggen: wow that's worse
 5DN1L: you put in only one thrust
 5DN1L: not two
 Aldoggen: the previous one was good
 Razerk: haaaaaaaa
 Astrobytes: in your first example, thrust == 50
 Razerk:     console.log(nextCheckpointX + ' ' + nextCheckpointY + '80');
 Razerk: This you meant?
 Aldoggen: that works too, except you need a space before the 80
 Razerk: the space don't work when I paste, I feel
 Aldoggen: it should
 Aldoggen: it did until now
 Razerk: Report me then haha, thanks for helping btw
 Aldoggen: is it working now?
 Razerk: Yeeees&#160;!
 Aldoggen: nice!
 Astrobytes: :shrug:
 Astrobytes: glad you got it working tho&#160;:)
 Razerk: Huge thanks to you 5DN1L
 5DN1L: oh wow, np
 Razerk: yep thanks too Astro&#160;!
 Aldoggen: enjoy your spot in bronze
 Astrobytes: you're welcome, I think&#160;?

 wediaklup: ah ok
 Astrobytes: we are but a figment of your imagination
 Aldoggen: I was gonna say we executed some XSS but that works too
 Astrobytes: :D
 Aldoggen: my line racing bot keeps doing dumb stuff
 Astrobytes: in what way?
 Aldoggen: I can't articulate it. not even sure if it's dumb
 Aldoggen: it's probably better than I am already
 Astrobytes: searching or just the floodfilling still?

 Aldoggen: I said I don't know, it's probably just a combination of my eval and an unlucky seed
 Astrobytes: there are some starting positions that are unavoidable losses iirc unless your opponent(s) do something insanely stupid
 Aldoggen: I can imagine
 Aldoggen: okay I think I should change the eval <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/649115192">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/649115192</a>

 Aldoggen: it's trying to annoy the enemy as much as it is trying to win now
 Aldoggen: need to win a bit more and annoy a bit less
 Astrobytes: gotta go do some stuff, afk a few hours, good luck with the eval tweaking!
 jacek: can Automaton2000 be annoyed
 Automaton2000: so i can see that it is a very good idea
 Nikanameu: there is no annoying only good and bad move
 Aldoggen: Automaton2000 wants to be annoyed apparently
 Automaton2000: let me take a look at this
 Nikanameu: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: do you have a real bot

 jacek: do submits work?
 Aldoggen: submits?
 jacek: leaderboards seemed stopped
 Aldoggen: I went from wood 2 to silver in line racing today
 Aldoggen: seems to work
 jacek: what about now
 jacek: my submit stopped at 58% and i see in mad pod racing they are not moved for others
 Aldoggen: I'm submitting
 Aldoggen: it's pretty slow, but my battle progress is going up
 Aldoggen: 9%
 jacek: green circle has leagues and repushed AIs from the challenge :tada:
 jacek: so maybe its just slow
 struct: nice im silver...
 struct: :p
 struct: I guess something broke on reusing it
 jacek: still at 58% ;d
 struct: The repushed part didnt work did itjacek?
 brend0g: anyone wanna spunk on me?
 brend0g: :grinning:
 jacek: struct servers went green mode
 Aldoggen: lol
 Maximoo62: brend0g... what the actual frick
 Maximoo62: not cool bro
 Aldoggen: wow now I'm stuck at 9%
 wediaklup: how do i explicitly copy an object in python?
 Aldoggen: deep copy or shallow?
 eulerscheZahl: json.loads(json.dumps(object))
 Aldoggen: also, what kind of object?
 Aldoggen: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 Scarfield: lol the leaderboard for green circle looks broken
 wediaklup: i have a class and i want to make a copy of my object
 Aldoggen: wediaklup you could make a constructor for your class that accepts an object of your class
 Aldoggen: I don't remember if that works
 wediaklup: that should work i think
 Aldoggen: you can only have one constructor, so it involves type testing your arguments or something
 Aldoggen: I'd just make a class method or static method that does it
 Aldoggen: Scarfield how is it broken? 
 BlaiseEbuth: o/ Breakfield
 Scarfield: players from legend during the contest are now in silver. 
 Scarfield: oi blaise
 Aldoggen: I've heard something about that being the highest rank currently
 Aldoggen: yeah, don't know what's up with that lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Where do you see that Blindfield? I saw it all normal
 BlaiseEbuth: *see
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/green-circle/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/green-circle/leaderboard</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yes. The legend league were drastically reduced. My bad hadn't scrolled
 BugKiller_328: hi, 
 wediaklup: hi
 BugKiller_328: minimax can be used if game will be more than 2 players&#160;?
 jacek: then it is n-max
 MSmits: contest winners of green circle are in silver rank 1 and 2 with 173 people above them
 Aldoggen: look up minimax for more than two players BugKiller_328
 jacek: or max-n :thinking:
 BlaiseEbuth: With some adaptation and concessions yes
 BlaiseEbuth: A paranoid 
 Scarfield: i suggest to move my bot from silver to legend, to even out the mistake, should be fair
 5DN1L: maybe because the bots were submitted before the import, and the original bots won't be imported in such cases?
 struct: I suggest mine to be promoted to legend
 struct: since its above legend bots
 struct: .9
 struct:&#160;:)
 BugKiller_328: how are you picking the minimax VS MCTS based on the game?
 struct: I always use mcts
 MSmits: if you're talking about mcts with a random rollout, then it depends on the game. Really long games, or games that potentially dont end (except on turn limit) are not good with mcts
 jacek: if you havent good eval use mcts
 Scarfield: rule of thumb, if you can evaluate a game state reliably minimax, if you cant evaluate reliably mcts
 MSmits: but there's mcts with early playout termination, where you just eval at some point, then minimax and mcts are both using eval, 
 jacek: evalfield
 Scarfield: NNcek
 eulerscheZahl: will jacek be able to beat his own boss?
 struct: ah double exp
 struct: nice
 struct: boss is almost finishing the battles
 struct: but mirrored battles are not up yet
 wlesavo: oooh, nice, is this a bribe for us to forgot about chat delete? :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: boss finished, move me up
 struct: oh I need to get a battle vs some1 that is on submit
 struct: so I get promoted
 struct: its how its working atm
 struct: fight me jacek
 eulerscheZahl: ah, interesting
 eulerscheZahl: i'll sit it out
 eulerscheZahl: everyone playing vs smits will be gone the next moment
 eulerscheZahl: yay, gold
 eulerscheZahl: python gold boss?
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't look right
 struct: I guess gold is old silver
 struct: just my guess because we start at silver this time
 struct: but we were supposed to be bronze
 eulerscheZahl: i have the same impression
 struct: yeap boss seems to weak
 struct: I guess they will revert it
 eulerscheZahl: jacek your boss sucks
 Razovsky: man don't say that
 eulerscheZahl: at least struct can make it to legend now
 Razovsky: during the challenge it was horrible to beat jacek
 eulerscheZahl: i'm trolling, it's not jacek's boss anymore
 kovi: how some are already in legend?
 BlaiseEbuth: They paid
 struct: kovi people that didnt submit
 struct: on this arena
 struct: + broken gold boss
 kovi: i c
 eulerscheZahl: Q
 kovi: err....what? from wood4-&gt;legend without matches?
 BlaiseEbuth: smooth
 Razovsky: yeah
 Razovsky: easy
 Razovsky: :P
 eulerscheZahl: gold boss isn't broken. probably just the silver boss. which in return might make the silver boss the old bronze boss
 eulerscheZahl: CG christmas
 DevMarcao: just curious, for the ones who are on high level on CodingGame, do you put your profile on linkedin or in your resume? Or it doesnt change anything for tech recruiters?
 Aldoggen: I've put it on all my resumes I've landed tech jobs with
 Nikanameu: westiclees try harass me private forum omg
 Sheeesh---: wait
 Sheeesh---: how can i get back the code i used in the last competition?
 eulerscheZahl: last code: from contest reports
 eulerscheZahl: previous ones: your local git repo
 struct: boss is now js
 struct: lol
 darkhorse64: Will I get promoted to Legend, then put back in Gold or even Bronze and loot XP again :yum:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: thank got they let the old boss submit finish before replacing it
 eulerscheZahl: large legend
 struct: who is this boss o.o
 darkhorse64: The new one is not jacek's. There is hope for an even larger league
 [CG]Thibaud: so Julien made a mistake and took another Gold bot as the boss. We'll let it as it is now.
 struct: legend will be larger than gold
 darkhorse64: Hmm, The JS boss looks very strong
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Aldoggen: I guess they've put more work in this boss than in the game itself
 Sheeesh---: the games in arena are only one side
 Sheeesh---: like you fight a bot one time
 struct: The game is fine
 struct: and they do not need to put work on bosses
 struct: Since they can choose from one of the players
 Sheeesh---: not two times like in the competition
 jacek: struct legend today or delete?
 struct: I think it's safe
 eulerscheZahl: and then CG realizes some other mistake and closes legend for the day to make a new one tomorrow
 struct: lol
 jacek: why they didnt do it at friday evening this time
 Scarfield: why not just move the leaderboard as is, like they did the previous contests?
 eulerscheZahl: because some players have already submitted again. too late for a 100% move
 Viveli: hello there
 struct: They just need to open a league above legend now
 struct: and everything will be fixed
 darkhorse64: The boss looks approximately like a 150th rank from the leaderboard
 eulerscheZahl: the diamond league?
 darkhorse64: maybe even less
 jacek: jacek league
 Scarfield: xD
 darkhorse64: the imaginary league
 Dapps: what a pleasant surprise. made it to legend without touching my code
 eulerscheZahl: because they made a bug in boss selection
 Dapps: oh.. it's not because i'm awesome
 eulerscheZahl: sorry to crush your dreams
 darkhorse64: Another blow in our self-esteem

 eulerscheZahl: and the new gold boss looks weaker than the old one
 Scarfield: its almost like giving out gold medals to all participants in kids soccer
 5DN1L: Illedan ‚Äî @[CG] Thibaud that seems like the wrong gold boss? Too many will promote üò±
 jacek: participation medals?
 5DN1L: [CG] Thibaud ‚Äî it's not the same but I trust Julien to have taken a proper one ü§î  it seems he did not

 BlaiseEbuth: :thinking:
 darkhorse64: Boss is suddenly on fire, promotion is gone
 Aldoggen: we can perform puzzle of the week on the boss
 Aldoggen: or is it already over?
 eulerscheZahl: still weaker than the contest boss
 Astrobytes: there goes my motivation again
 eulerscheZahl: the puzzle of the week is a different fire Aldoggen. without boss
 BlaiseEbuth: Puzzle of the weak
 Aldoggen: well, I'll try to think of a better joke next time
 Scarfield: its like a motivational poster; we are all legends
 Astrobytes: Shame on you Aldoggen :P
 Aldoggen: if everyone is a legend, no one is
 Aldoggen: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: ngl
 struct: Ok now I can see that my bot was not that weak
 Scarfield: why not just make it a shared 1st for everyone
 struct: I must have gotten unlucky
 Aldoggen: I don't understand why promotion to gold has to take so long
 struct: Because submits need to finish Aldoggen
 darkhorse64: 230 on going
 Aldoggen: I... what?
 Astrobytes: you made gold in tron Aldoggen?
 Aldoggen: yup
 Astrobytes: nice one&#160;:) Promotions to gold and legend on big multis always take ages
 Astrobytes: to er, "force you to take a break" :rofl:
 Aldoggen: yeah, really don't understand why lol
 Aldoggen: kills my motivation
 JohnyDaison: How did I get to Legend though? It's just a simple heuristic bot...
 Aldoggen: I had ideas to improve it
 Aldoggen: JohnyDaison green circle is bugged
 JohnyDaison: Not enough CODE_REVIEW, eh?
 Aldoggen: I guess
 eulerscheZahl: wait until you reach CSB gold and have to rewrite your whole code
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, that
 eulerscheZahl: CBS = mad pod racing
 Aldoggen: I already did
 eulerscheZahl: did it kill your motivation?
 Aldoggen: wasn't fun
 Aldoggen: a bit yeah
 Aldoggen: now I'm stuck at around 700 or 400 or so
 Aldoggen: somehow made it there with only heuristics
 Astrobytes: you can get legend with heuristics too
 Aldoggen: I'll eventually try to&#160;:)
 Aldoggen: but legend games are different too right?
 Astrobytes: only heuristics also works for fantastic bits legend too
 Astrobytes: sorry, "broomstick flyers"
 Westicles: Nikanameu, what's this now?
 Scarfield: for CSB i think the max thrust is changed from gold to legend, but that is the only change iirc
 eulerscheZahl: 100 -&gt; 200
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if the 75ms/turn is a legend thing or everywhere
 Aldoggen: pretty sure it's everywhere
 Aldoggen: at least it's not instant
 Aldoggen: that's what got me through the lower leagues, realizing that I should hold my thrust while my bot was turning
 Scarfield: -3vel&#160;?
 Aldoggen: somehow CG has learned that I do my bot programming in java and my puzzles in python
 Aldoggen: me gusta
 BoBot: Hello BoBot, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0d7cd93-eebf-488c-a6b4-a98d93d4e697">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/a0d7cd93-eebf-488c-a6b4-a98d93d4e697</a>
 Aldoggen: nice
 BoBot: oops
 Aldoggen: on top of that, those pastebin links are broken
 jacek: oh my
 5DN1L: Aldoggen you're speed-running on CG?
 Aldoggen: am I speedrunning?
 Aldoggen: I'm having fun at least
 5DN1L: did you get to Level 17 in 2 weeks?
 Aldoggen: uh yep
 BoBot: was going to write that I got Legend in Green Circle somehow, though I was not close to it during the contest... so either they made the boss weaker or I got reaaally lucky lol
 Aldoggen: BoBot it's bugged
 BoBot: the game?
 struct: but you will stay in legend
 Aldoggen: 5DN1L I spent a lot of time on this site. maybe a bit too much
 Scarfield: they made a mistake on picked a weaker boss bot
 darkhorse64: no bugged but not the same bot
 5DN1L: Aldoggen your speed is amazing
 Aldoggen: &lt;3
 BoBot: well lucky me :D
 BoBot: yea, Gold is smaller than Legend now
 BoBot: haha
 Sheeesh---: and here i'am in wood 2
 Sheeesh---: because i was late to the party
 Sheeesh---: gotta go fast
 mannouao: :joy:
 AntoninLdn: bonjour je cherche un stage
 Rikus: qquestion, are there any bots that use NN (DQN, AZ, or similar) on games that have 50ms turn limit?
 Aldoggen: moi aussi I guess
 0xhotdawg: mais pour what?
 Aldoggen: pour travailler no?
 struct: Rikus yes
 Sheeesh---: RIkus&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/green-circle-feedback-strategies/196574/5">https://forum.codingame.com/t/green-circle-feedback-strategies/196574/5</a>
 struct: Check jacek profile, most of his bots are NNs
 Rikus: awesome! Ty for the info to both!
 struct: and there are a few more games that have NNs at the top
 jacek: yes there are
 BlaiseEbuth: oO
 Sheeesh---: wood 1 boss is in rank 127
 Sheeesh---: lol
 Wontonimo: congrats Aldoggen on your speedrun up the ranks&#160;! 
 jacek: :taco: struct
 Wontonimo: sorry, tacobot is still unplugged
 Aldoggen: Wontonimo lol thanks, I'm just having fun
 jacek: fun? here? :unamused:
 Wontonimo: i can't think of a better reason
 Aldoggen: lol jacek
 Aldoggen: gold league bots everyone <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/649173690">https://www.codingame.com/replay/649173690</a>
 eulerscheZahl: maybe some language update broke them
 Aldoggen: 3 -&gt; possibly 4 bots maybe broke them
 jacek: more exp for league advancing :Tada:
 Wontonimo: oh, i see you are also doing bot battles Aldoggen.  very nice.  I liked tron.  Are you working on it now (it's called line racing)
 Aldoggen: I am not working on it
 Aldoggen: currently*
 Aldoggen: I just got promoted to gold and I'm looking at the battles it's doing
 Wontonimo: what is your background?  are you a CS student?
 Aldoggen: math student
 Aldoggen: I took some CS courses as elective courses though
 Wontonimo: is programming part of the course work for math these days?  Computations analysis or something?
 Wontonimo: ah
 Aldoggen: and there were some basic cs courses already included in the math program
 Aldoggen: like a basic introduction to programming in python
 Aldoggen: I did plenty of programming in a variety of languages, even outside the CS classes
 Aldoggen: languages like R, matlab, python of course. I've dabbled a bit with julia. 
 Wontonimo: i did some matlab also.  don't remember any of it
 Wontonimo: gotta go.  Nice meeting you Aldoggen :wave:
 Wontonimo: later struct jacek
 Aldoggen: cya!
 struct: cya Wontonimo
 Shivzee: Neffex OP
 Aldoggen: I'm currently implementing flood fill in a rectangular grid by setting elements of a twodimensional arraylist (yes, this is java). any ideas for a faster implementation?
 jacek: arraylist of objects?
 jacek: or primitives
 Aldoggen: String, so objects
 Aldoggen: I guess I could make them char if that improves performance
 Aldoggen: they only have length 1
 jacek: so 2d array of chars
 jacek: so no unneeded boxing/unboxing
 Aldoggen: wow I guess that can help
 Aldoggen: ideally I would build a sim (or whatever you call it) and test it
 Aldoggen: thanks!
 boumagik: the pushes are slow as hell
 boumagik: @codingame
 Aldoggen: it's been like this for a few hours
 BlaiseEbuth: Hell is not slow. Don't tell such lies about my business  or I sew you for defamation. :angry:
 boumagik: Slow as a turtle *
 boumagik:&#160;:)
 Sheeesh---: i mean
 Sheeesh---: everyone is pushing
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:)
 Sheeesh---: soo it's normal to be slow
 boumagik: Is there a contest going on&#160;?
 boumagik: I'm just trying to push my bot to legend on springchallenge 2021
 5DN1L: 534 bots being computed in Green Circle
 boumagik: arf
 Uljahn: yep, past contest being introduced as multiplayer
 boumagik: Also, can anyone confirm&#160;: in challenges introduced as multiplayer, bots you win or loose against could go up and now in ranking, and you could see an arrow up green, or down red indicating the recent tendency
 boumagik: now it looks like it is fixed and never moving (for the othe bots)
 boumagik: they seem to stay at their rank
 Uljahn: maybe the rank change is lower than some tolerance
 Uljahn: that's how trueskill works
 boumagik: yes, in contest I suppose
 boumagik: but in multiplayer outside of it, is it enabled&#160;?
 Uljahn: yes, but the more games you have, the less the rank change
 boumagik: ok, might as well be
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-spring-challenge-2021/boumagik">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-spring-challenge-2021/boumagik</a>bots around you are kinda old, they had a lot of matches so their rank is very stable, you need to get a bunch of matches with one of them to change its rank noticably i guess
 Westicles: Someone needs to approve Takuzu Solver
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/18957f95843f0fd886c743c6c40f4e14aee89">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/18957f95843f0fd886c743c6c40f4e14aee89</a>
 boumagik: Uljahn ok thanks for the input
 Westicles: We already have Sudoku, Kakuro, Shikaku,  Futoshiki, Hitori, and Nurikabe so this is a big omission
 jacek: :upside_down:
 BlaiseEbuth: Approve it yourself
 Westicles: already did
 jacek: approve from your alts
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm too slow
 Westicles: never done that before, not going to start now
 BlaiseEbuth: There's a first time for everything
 Westicles: If I didn't do it when Abusing the System had 2 approvals I never will
 Westicles: Hmmm, actually it is still sitting at 2-2 :thinking:
 JustnTime: Damn the arena goes so slow
 SatelliteMaster1337: hello
 SatelliteMaster1337: does anyone use ruby
 struct: only for golf
 SatelliteMaster1337: yeah lol is it useful anymore fo ranything else?
 jacek: maybe snooker
 SatelliteMaster1337: thx&#160;;)
 HenroLST: can someone explain to me how to reconsturct a path from a BFS with coords? i tried using a map where each coordinate was the key with its parent coord as the element but it ran too slow
 5DN1L: That sounds like the right way to do it, maybe something else is the issue?
 HenroLST: it worked on the simpler test case but on a test case with a longer puzzle it just didnt work
 HenroLST: Lemme recode it and try again
 Aldoggen: I can take a look at it in 10 mins HenroLST
 HenroLST: yay, thanks!
 jacek: woah struct in legend
 struct: omg I dont have to delete now
 HenroLST: lmao
 struct: how can your submit and msmits be finished
 struct: when mine was in gold before you
 MSmits: I use 1 ms most turns...
 struct: so do I
 struct: maybe the templates are slow
 MSmits: templates are never slow
 struct: and take a while to compile
 struct: I mean for compilation time
 MSmits: sure, they dont recompile the bot for every fight do they?
 MSmits: also, i too use templates
 struct: Some say no some say yes
 struct: an answer we will never know
 struct: I guess its easy enough to test
 struct: ill use C4 for it
 jacek: i use 1ms at most too
 jacek: surely a green contest
 MSmits: you are going to break into their office with C$?
 MSmits: C4?
 MSmits: sounds a bit excessive
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: I need to recover chat
 Aldoggen: I just did the network cabling puzzle
 MSmits: ahh that one
 MSmits: it's a lot easier than it seems
 Aldoggen: I hate how they tell you to search a minimum, but the minimum is not a minimum
 Aldoggen: it's not optimal
 Aldoggen: arghhh
 Aldoggen: sorry 
 jacek: hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: oO
 Astrobytes: Oo
 Aldoggen: so my first approach was to use least squares to find the optimal height for that horizontal power line
 Aldoggen: nope, doesn't pass some tests
 BlaiseEbuth: overcomplicated
 MSmits: isnt this just manhattan distance?
 MSmits: I think you may just have misunderstood the problem
 Aldoggen: maybe
 Aldoggen: I think it should at least be better defined
 jacek: you dont need to understand a problem to solve it
 Aldoggen: yeha apparently
 jacek: :smirk:
 HenroLST: sheesh just make  a AI to solve it
 Aldoggen: you would know everything about that huh jacek?&#160;;)
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Aldoggen: I'm just gonna plop an NN on it next time&#160;:)
 HenroLST: easy
 Aldoggen: though I still don't understand how there can be manhattan distance involved
 5DN1L: Aldoggen use NN to solve Onboarding first: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/onboarding</a>
 MSmits: if they are just straight lines then manhattan and euclidean distance are the same
 Aldoggen: ah, that's what you mean. thought you meant proper 2D manhattan distance
 Aldoggen: okay you know what? I'm gonna learn about NN and implement a simple one to do the onboarding puzzle
 5DN1L: nice
 jacek: there is one in the solutions
 jacek: that is if you done onboarding
 5DN1L: yeah Aldoggen won't be the first person to do so
 Aldoggen: lol 
 Aldoggen: I'm not trying to be the first
 elie.f.asmar: hello
 elie.f.asmar: is it possible to change contribution type from Classic Puzzle to clash? (Status = Pending)
 struct: Im not sure actually 
 5DN1L: it looks like you have to make the choice initially and can't change afterwards? i'm not sure either
 jacek: probably not
 struct: yeah you cant
 struct: ok its only compiled once
 PatrickMcGinnisII: jello , it's the 4th of July... the day all us Yanks blow stuff up

 BlaiseEbuth: The teapot one?
 Aldoggen: yup
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 Aldoggen: someone probably has made a smart teapot that always returns this
 Aldoggen: someone somewhere
 darkhorse64: There is only one teapot
 BlaiseEbuth: :scream:
 Aldoggen: can you prove that?
 darkhorse64: I am the teapot. This is not debatable
 jacek: cna you disprove that?
 Aldoggen: I'd say we have two teapots at home, but I'm afraid they're coffee thermoses
 Aldoggen: or whatever those things are called
 Wishbone: I'd say it's pretty easy to tell a teapot and a thermos apart.
 Aldoggen: can you prove that?
 TimeEngineer: Jacek can I know which activation function you use for your NN&#160;?
 Aldoggen: linear
 Aldoggen: (jk. that probably sucks)

 Wishbone: Quite easy to tell apart, actually&#160;;-)
 struct: He probably uses ReLu
 Aldoggen: I was gonna make a joke about being a topologist and not seeing the difference, but they're topologically different
 Aldoggen: you beat me wishbone lol
 Wishbone: Hehe, nitpicking is one of my primary skills&#160;:-D
 Aldoggen: lol
 jacek: TimeEngineer for hidden layers its relu
 jacek: and linear for output in dqn
 TimeEngineer: I tried to implement from scratch a NN to play tictactoe, but I don't know why it's so difficult
 jacek: or tanh in mcts stuff
 TimeEngineer: Maybe it's because Softmax + Q-learning
 jacek: suprisingly tic tac toe requires plenty of layers and/or nodes to play perfectly
 TimeEngineer: And GreenCircle not&#160;?
 TimeEngineer: Do you think that Softmax and Qlearning can match together&#160;?
 jacek: it doesnt play perfectly, does it?
 TimeEngineer: Sorry I'm newbie in AI :sweat_smile:
 jacek: but yeah, green circle is a little more complicated than tic tac toe ;v
 Aldoggen: just a little&#160;:)
 MSmits: TimeEngineer i got TTT to 97% perfect with 1 hidden layer and something like 30 hidden nodes
 jacek: hmm normally youd use linear output layer for Q-learning, as it mimics the Q-table
 jacek: softmax thing is more for actor-critic and others
 TimeEngineer: :thinking:
 TimeEngineer: That makes sens
 TimeEngineer: sense*
 TimeEngineer: MSmits with which activation functions&#160;?
 MSmits: the thing is, NN's don't have to be perfect when you're playing boardgames. Generally you're using them as eval at the end of a selection phase and backpropagate the result, averaging it with many other results. Because it is averaged, it doesnt have to be perfect
 MSmits: I think i used relu 
 MSmits: softmax for output i guess
 TimeEngineer: Supervised training&#160;?
 MSmits: this is why ttt is not a great testbed. If you search deeper, you soon hit the end of the game and require no eval at all. You'll just be mcts-ing it
 Westicles: PatrickMcGinnisII, I'm jealous mortars are awesome
 MSmits: I did supervised yes. I labelled all reachable states with labels from minimax
 jacek: value n-tuples network for tic-tac-toe, supervised from all positions, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple">https://github.com/jdermont/tictactoe-ntuple</a>
 MSmits: yeah thats the same thing except training ntuples weights instead of nn weights
 TimeEngineer: Also I noticed something, When I train a lot, my weights can overflow, is it normal&#160;?
 MSmits: what do you mean overflow?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :boom:
 TimeEngineer: They become big
 MSmits: mmh i did not have that issue
 jacek: and you get nan?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :flip: :boom:
 TimeEngineer: I don't use framework, that's why
 MSmits: I didn't either
 Westicles: I'm stuck in this stupid blue state where you can't even have sparklers
 MSmits: well not at first
 PatrickMcGinnisII: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª

 [AaZZz09_.-]: NEED SOME SHELP
 MSmits: i dont mind sharing my code if i can find it TimeEngineer
 jacek: neither do i, i have small learning rate and i clip errors to be abs max 1
 struct: [AaZZz09_.-] turn caps lock off
 jacek: struct row-of 3 has 27 states. x2 for player to move. there are 8 such rows in TTT

 struct: ah I think I understand jacek
 jacek: linear sin?
 j4at: yeah
 jacek: weird flex but ok
 j4at: Normally people use tanh for ddpg. But it has bias because not the same gradient in all points
 jacek: Vicvicvic do you do as said in the comments?
 j4at: so you need to use custom gradient
 j4at: or just use linear sin
 jacek: the NN is quite sinner
 TimeEngineer: Ok, thanks all I will try to implement with your recommandation jacek, I really want a dqn :smile:
 jacek: at least its something you know it works
 jacek: depending on the implementation and hyperparameters, it always took around 10k games to start winning over 90% against random opponent
 jacek: it was like 0 0 0 0 0... and sudden spike to 99

 jacek: for hexapawn might as well do hashtable
 MSmits: I did this
 struct: might as well hard code it by hand

 jacek: TimeEngineer also (maybe its obvious), if next state is other player, I use -Qmax(next_state) as target
 MSmits: hexapawn with simple q-learning (hash table)
 jacek: (notice the minus)
 TimeEngineer: Really&#160;?
 jacek: its the move of the opponent and you want to minimize it
 TimeEngineer: I used the same NN for the opponentand my nextQmax is 2 step after
 jacek: oh. it could be just implementation detail
 TimeEngineer: Is it a mistake, if so, why&#160;? :thinking
 j4at: the jacek way is better
 Aldoggen: that's why he gets a league all for his own for green circle
 Aldoggen: just below the last wood tier
 j4at: because its guarantees that the opponent plays the "best" move
 j4at: also it normalizes the reward 
 j4at: (makes it have a mean of 0)
 TimeEngineer: Ah&#160;! i made a mistake in my implementation, I give a reward of -1 in my softmax nodes xD
 TimeEngineer: Thanks for the tip&#160;!
 j4at: Using nextQmax 2 steps after makes it kinda on-policy. But dqn is off-policy SARSA is on-policy
 jacek: oh my, i had small bug in my clash of bots sim implementation
 jacek: need to train again -.-
 j4at: first time&#160;? I always make bugs in my simulations that I don't complain anymore
 jacek: thats why i copied green circle referee. any bugs there are also in arena
 Aldoggen: XD
 Aldoggen: which means they are features
 jacek: probably it would exploit that infinite draw glitch
 j4at: My search race  training script spends 50% of the time on the simulation. It's written in python and very very not optimized at all.
 Aldoggen: oof
 j4at: Maybe I should rewrite it in Cython
 DomiKo: just use c++
 DomiKo: Hello :D 
 struct: hi
 jacek: then its something wrong. my NN stuff take over 90% time
 DomiKo: I agree with jacek
 struct: my NN takes 0% time
 DomiKo: super fast
 struct: got legend on green circle with it
 HenroLST: sheesh
 DomiKo: I'm stuck in gold now&#160;;(
 jacek: why? i dont forbid you to get into legend
 j4at: well C or C++ it all the same for such a simple simulation
 j4at: I'm used to extending python using C tho
 DomiKo: jacek I beat you once, and now you are stronger! Your NN learned on me
 jacek: its different gold boss
 struct: yeah its not jacek anymore
 DomiKo: really?
 struct: its a weaker boss
 DomiKo: lol
 DomiKo: why?
 struct: no idea look at legend size
 jacek: at first it was some noob boss
 jacek: thats why legend is so big
 struct: first it was silver boss
 struct: as gold boss
 Aldoggen: they could reset all the ranks
 struct: Which made everyone promote
 DomiKo: everyone except me...
 struct: because you submited your code
 DomiKo: ohhh
 DomiKo: so they broke it
 DomiKo: nice
 j4at: I wroteself.angle = radians(degrees(self.angle) + angle)
 DomiKo: it's always hard to not make mistakes
 DomiKo: it's even harder to debug it 
 struct: I only have bugs when I read the statement
 DomiKo: 143 computing people O.o
 DomiKo: I see why, submits are so slow
 struct: yeah it was 600 before
 jacek: time to promote in csb :imp:
 Aldoggen: hehe&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: ezpz
 j4at: csb&#160;?
 DomiKo: csb finally?
 DomiKo: mad pod racing j4at
 BlaiseEbuth: Cad Sod Bacing
 Aldoggen: cod said bark
 j4at: Hehe Coders Strike Back.Well I will it a try, maybe! Last time training my search race NN, time to move on another game. I gave up on passing DomiKo+Recurse. I will pass struct atleast :p
 struct: well I could hardcode
 j4at: I'm not hardcoding tho&#160;:)
 struct: didnt you say that you are using the best result your NN found for the validator?
 j4at: I'm not even using the validators for training my NN
 j4at: well my best NN result is 11000
 j4at: but it's not deteminstic so  Iso i use best games
 j4at: which barely improves it
 j4at: to 10800
 struct: ah so you sim?
 struct: or what do you mean by best games
 j4at: Well Its kinda brute force. I have 2 actors after training so i mix their actions
 j4at: So its kinda hardcoded but it doesn't make any difference
 Illedan: 2 actors?
 j4at: 2 policy NNs
 Illedan: 2 different NNs? Or 2 outputs?
 j4at: 2 different NNS
 Illedan: hmm
 Illedan: Why 2?
 j4at: Its to stabilize ddpg. 
 DomiKo: you are using Actor Critic methode right?
 j4at: ddpg
 j4at: with some changes
 j4at: yeah ddpg have an Actor + Critic 
 DomiKo: yeah I know
 j4at: So when an Actor learns from a Critic that learns from an Actor. The actor can trick the critic creating a lot of noise that's why I have 2 actors and 2 critics
 Illedan: ok, thx
 j4at: What are you using DomiKo?
 DomiKo: in search race?
 j4at: yeah
 DomiKo: that should be Double Dueling DQN
 DomiKo: with prioritised memory replay buffer
 DomiKo: I was training on random maps
 j4at: discrete actions&#160;?
 DomiKo: yes
 j4at: damn
 j4at: what actions are using&#160;?
 DomiKo: let me check
 DomiKo: [-18, -9, 0, 9, 18] x [0, 200]
 j4at: bruh
 j4at: you are the 13th with that :3
 DomiKo: I never really tried doing it. It was a simple test before CSB
 DomiKo: it that good or bad?
 struct: terrible domiko
 DomiKo: :sob:
 struct:&#160;:)
 DomiKo: * domiko crying in the corner*
 j4at: well you are doing better than me. So, I can't judge you :p But yeah you should have used continuous actions
 DomiKo: not in CSB
 DomiKo: that's why I'm not using them here
 j4at: nice
 j4at: I didn't use a prioritised memory replay buffer because I didn't feel like it
 DomiKo: it did a lot for me in CSB
 struct: too many NN terminology for me
 DomiKo: should we stop?
 struct: no lol
 DomiKo: from the other game.I've finally used MSmits endgame solver in Oware!
 struct: for training?
 DomiKo: for validation only
 struct: is this the arena version?
 DomiKo: I've never really known that scores for positions with only different turn could vary that much 
 DomiKo: firstly I used scores for position with 150 turns left and my NN was solving like 70% of them
 DomiKo: but it couldn't do better
 DomiKo: then I looked at score of position with 150, 100, 50, 20, 10 turns left
 DomiKo: and I was really shocked
 DomiKo: so now I'm training the first agent that uses number of turns left :D 
 DomiKo: hope it will be better
 struct: so its an input?
 DomiKo: yes
 DomiKo: right now after 20min I can solve 78% 
 struct: o.o
 Illedan: Where can I find that endgame solver?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58572">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58572</a>
 DomiKo: from it you can create many samples
 DomiKo: it should be close to 200K * 100
 DomiKo: I knew that number of turns left was important, but it turns out that it's very important for boards with small amount of seeds
 Secart: 1
 DomiKo: 81%!!!
 struct: are you using 9 seed or more domiko?
 DomiKo: only 9
 DomiKo: every position with 9 or less ofc
 struct: yeah
 j4at: Does anyone have csb simulation&#160;?
 struct: the referee?
 j4at: yeah
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Coders%20Strike%20Back/Referee.java">https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Coders%20Strike%20Back/Referee.java</a>
 struct: I think it's supposed to be this
 Aldoggen: it's literally in the description j4at
 j4at: I can't use that tho
 Aldoggen: oh
 j4at: I need to change it and recompile
 j4at: I don't know java
 Aldoggen: what's wrong with it?
 j4at: And I don't want to use brutaltester
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/robostac/coders-strike-back-referee">https://github.com/robostac/coders-strike-back-referee</a>
 struct: oh well
 struct: cant help you then
 struct: I dont have any referee in py
 Aldoggen: do you need to change it or do you need it in python?
 j4at: ah that will do thank you&#160;:)
 Darleanow: hello guys
 Darleanow: can, you remind me about the euler's website
 HenroLST: does anyone know a good puzzle to practice simulations?
 Darleanow: i forgot the url&#160;:/
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 struct: HenroLST why not a multi?
 struct: or a optimization
 HenroLST: uh not sure
 Darleanow: thanks struct ;√†
 Darleanow:&#160;:)*
 struct: np
 struct: I think search race is nice to learn how to sim
 struct: random search can work
 HenroLST: ok, thank you!
 struct: but might be hard to get into at the start
 Aldoggen: it's a bit like mad pods lol
 struct: well its single player
 Aldoggen: if I see this right
 struct: yes
 struct: the physics are the same
 struct: physics are here in code if you need
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html">http://files.magusgeek.com/csb/csb_en.html</a>
 Aldoggen: my mad pod code would work well for this
 Aldoggen: it's more optimized for single player
 j4at: There is a big gap between top 4 and the others in mad pod racing.
 struct: NNs vs non NNs
 Aldoggen: lol
 HenroLST: smh
 Aldoggen: I can imagine
 j4at: I wonder if i can make it to gold league with my search race code unchanged
 DomiKo: you should
 struct: even probably legend
 struct: you dont need collisions to get legend
 BlaiseEbuth: 2 pods
 struct: pod collisions I mean
 Aldoggen: my mad pod code does not work in the slightes
 Aldoggen: t
 Aldoggen: yeah, maybe I should have checked input order
 j4at: struct Did you try beam search with only [0, 200] thrusts and [-18,-9,0,9,18] angles?
 struct: my bot only has 5 moves
 j4at: ow
 struct: -18 0 18 200-18 18 0
 struct: the replay that I shared used 7 though
 struct: -9 9 200 was included 
 SubZeRoy9: Hello
 Jiry_XD: Why does clash of code have bots?
 Andriamanitra: this article explains it <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/clash-of-code-time-has-come-for-clash/</a>

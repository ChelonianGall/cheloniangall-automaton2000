 Smelty: ah yes the food chain
 nickheyer: Some... actually most of these prompt need to be rewritten by someone proficient in the English language.
 nickheyer: Not saying I am proficient enough to do the job, but some of them are seriously bad.
 Wontonimo: yeah, i rejected it also.  Before you go and add a 3rd rejection, please give him a day or two to try and clean up the description and respond to the rejection comments
 child_friend123: hello
 KOKKONUT: kokkonut
 RCroboticsteam: spent a while watching the best bots in mad pod racing and it is a thing of beauty
 5DN1L: You mean the bots in the Legend league?
 RCroboticsteam: yeah like the rank 1-10
 RCroboticsteam: my other account has one in legend league but its not the same thing at all
 RCroboticsteam: completely different game at top rank
 5DN1L: I see&#160;:)
 5DN1L: You can read some of the top players' post-mortem if you're interested
 5DN1L: not the top 10, but still very top
 Uljahn: top bots are NN

 BlaiseEbuth: Omae wa mou shindeiru
 datu12: Guys quick question
 C26_1: @datu12, give it a shot
 datu12: Could I run (N = (3*18))
 C26_1: What do you mean?
 datu12: AS part of an argument in an if else conditional?
 C26_1: Ah yes
 C26_1: Yes you can do that
 datu12: Oh okay thank you&#160;:)
 C26_1: if the number is 0 then turn to False boolean
 C26_1: Else the number turns to True boolean
 datu12: Yeah then it will run something else
 datu12: I am curernly doing darts
 datu12: and i was thinking of doing an if else and nest the conditionals together
 C26_1: @datu, what puzzles are you solving right now?
 datu12: The Dart 101
 C26_1: ok
 datu12: Currently writing the flochart
 datu12: How can i create a condition where they can only shoot 3 per round 
 datu12: unlimited round too I could never think of it
 datu12: should I make a custom function?
 C26_1: Yea if you want
 datu12: How can I do it? via do loop?
 aroufgansta: hi
 aroufgansta: how are you&#160;?
 C26_1: Wait
 datu12: Hey man whats up
 C26_1: What does "X" means
 aroufgansta: fine man
 aroufgansta: and u&#160;?
 datu12: X&#160;??
 datu12: What do y mean?
 C26_1: Ah missed
 aroufgansta:&#160;?
 datu12: @C26 its okay i was just asking how would you do that function
 C26_1: @aroufgansta, I'm solving the Dart 101 Puzzle
 datu12: Oh .. 
 datu12: lol
 datu12: Sorry bro did not mean to
 aroufgansta: i don't understand bro
 C26_1: I've an idea
 aroufgansta: yeah&#160;?
 C26_1: I'm gonna loop from the first shoots to the end
 aroufgansta: what is ur idea&#160;?
 C26_1: With some conditionals of course
 aroufgansta: oh okay bro
 C26_1: I have a sum = 0
 C26_1: I add the shoots to the sum
 aroufgansta: omgg
 aroufgansta: that fine?
 C26_1: As the sum excced 101, then take it from the before round and sums to the next
 C26_1: For example
 aroufgansta:&#160;?
 C26_1: 10 5 3*18 15 5 4 8
 aroufgansta: oh okay?
 aroufgansta: what do you mean&#160;?
 datu12: Okay so
 C26_1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/205d58ef-31e5-4979-bae5-efb81e52f574">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/205d58ef-31e5-4979-bae5-efb81e52f574</a>
 C26_1: But
 aroufgansta: oh that great
 C26_1: every time I summed, I have a little var called count
 datu12: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/825bbbd8-dbdd-4450-ad3c-c28a719b30f2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/825bbbd8-dbdd-4450-ad3c-c28a719b30f2</a>
 C26_1: yea
 datu12: sorry wrong send
 datu12: Oh my code went on a link
 C26_1: After the end, I'm gonna append the count to a list
 datu12: append?
 aroufgansta:&#160;?
 C26_1: if there's no count possible then assign it as None
 datu12: can you describe that? I dont know what you mean append
 C26_1: @date12, basically that's a function in Python
 C26_1: that helps you insert an element you want at the end of a list, array,...
 datu12: Im writing in C
 datu12: ahhhh
 C26_1: Oh, ok
 datu12: Oh an array!
 C26_1: Maybe there will be similarities between Python and C
 datu12: Yeah very similar in a way but I'm still new to C and my python is quite poor
 datu12: the more i learn C the better my python got really haha
 C26_1: That's the idea
 C26_1: You don't learn from the top
 aroufgansta: oh
 C26_1: You learn from the bottom
 C26_1: So that's why when you're newbie, senior will always try to encourage you that you'll need to learn C, C++, C# first before Python, Java...
 C26_1: Cuz who the hell learn integral before knows 2+2=4
 C26_1: That's just silly and unnatural
 datu12: Ohhh
 datu12: Oh --okay copy its really more informative!! C is
 datu12: Also i dont understand, As the sum excced 101, then take it from the before round and sums to the next
 aroufgansta: nice days guys
 datu12: Can you elaborate more on this please?
 C26_1: For example
 C26_1: 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 12
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: That should be3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 13
 C26_1: If you're shoots at 14 then the sum is 102
 C26_1: Exceed 101!!!
 C26_1: So step back 1 move, take 102 - 14 = 88
 C26_1: And skip the 14, add add the sum to the last 13
 C26_1: So 88 + 13 = 101
 datu12: Okay so i can just return it back 1 round less
 C26_1: yea
 C26_1: If the loop is done but either the sum is difference from 101
 C26_1: Then you know that's impossible to have a score of 101
 C26_1: So you can ignored the name of person who have that trails of score (shoots)
 datu12: Oh okay
 datu12: okay
 datu12: Thank you! I will try it this time!
 datu12: I will continue making this flo chart 
 datu12: I actually just thought of making an if else statement
 C26_1: @datu12, what about the multiplier&#160;? 
 C26_1: How can you handle that?
 C26_1: Like 3*18
 C26_1: I'm thinking gonna use regex to find the first number and the second one
 C26_1: using grouping
 datu12: I honestly was just looking at it
 datu12: Im still in thinking mode as I don't know how to process it
 datu12: Well I could possibly run a custom variable but I do not know what else is what

 5DN1L: for being ninjadip lol
 ninjadip: ah
 ninjadip: what does it take like an hour before they advance you in a league after you beat everyone in the league
 5DN1L: can take even longer
 Wontonimo: to build anticipation&#160;!  make you yearn for it&#160;!  Give you a bathroom break
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah. Even through the chat we can smell you...
 Alshock: hey Wontonimo I just read your message on Alonehoc's CoC contrib and I didn't know there was any way to remove a rejection, how do you do that?
 Wontonimo: delete the message in the comments section
 Wontonimo: and it will remove the rejection&#160;!
 Alshock: Whaaaaaaat?
 Wontonimo: Thanks for following up on that
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: reject the rejection
 Automaton2000: im new here and this is the problem
 BlaiseEbuth: CG UX you can't understand.
 Wontonimo: Same with approval
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: have some turtle and do reject
 Automaton2000: now i use it in my scoring
 Stilgart: Wontonimo: and it's not gonna be fixed anytime soon&#160;:(
 Alshock: The chat reload made this message late: "Ok I just found how to do it, didn't mean to do it that way and I'm really mad with CG for that"
 Alshock: You actually go the other way around, you can't delete the message to remove the rejection but you can undo the rejection which remove all messages linked to it
 Alshock: I really really really hate that
 Wontonimo: weird
 Wontonimo: there was this contrib also <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/792089c7f21bf84806dacee83436b0ef28e4">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/792089c7f21bf84806dacee83436b0ef28e4</a>
 Alshock: So now to answer the OP I have to make a new comment out of the blue, great u_u
 Wontonimo: yeah, weird
 BlaiseEbuth: Shhttt CG's perfect. Peace and harmony be upon you.
 Wontonimo: btw, I agree that he spammed.  After talking with him, he understood and he was open to doing something about it.  specifically, he took down a bunch of the contribs and is waiting for more feedback and focusing more on quality over quantity
 Wontonimo: I was about to reject his contribs also Alshock.  Glad I was able to find him online
 jacek: oh my
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: It was just a bad time for so many contribs.  Interest in CG is at an all-time low right now
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Bot guys left, twitch guys left, very few people rating contribs
 BadBurger: the light bulb challenge is driving me insane! second task, it is expecting 21, but im doing it in 19steps, first one is 2, so i know the counter works, i have a +1 on it because it starts from 0, its added in the end. and i cant see on the logs that its bugged, seems to me its doable in 19moves
 BadBurger: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/QftYL31U">https://pastebin.com/QftYL31U</a>
 BadBurger: uploaded log for it, but i cant see thats its incorrect either. is the assignement flawed in that it dont require 21 steps?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: line 29, you can't do that
 BadBurger: i put the log to show table after move,  but its true false false, on both tables, but pleace explain why i cant do that because ive been stuck too long on this that its embarrasing
 BadBurger: ive rewrote this couple times, i think i have spent like 10h on this, atleast thats what it feels like
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: It was at TTFFT and you try to toggle 0.  You can't because 4 is on
 BadBurger: oh, aaah, i tought it was only i+2 and i+3 that needed to be off
 BadBurger: yeah that explains it, thank you! man i feel stupid...
 BadBurger: kinda want to rewrite the hole thing now.

 USSR_Chicken: :metal:
 Alshock: oh I think it's good to keep some comments in a solution though

 USSR_Chicken: OwO
 jacek: is it GA?
 Big_Code: what does GA mean? 
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: GAimax
 jacek: genetic algorithm
 Big_Code: Oh I see, I don't think so, at least not intentionally 
 jacek: oh my
 Big_Code: I used pandas and numpy
 Quidome: Any suggestions on code vs. zombies&#160;? I have a 35k score which is way to low
 Alshock: What kind of suggestion are you speaking of?
 jacek: make your code better [solved]
 Quidome: What kind of algorithm to zoom in
 Big_Code: :thinking:
 Alshock: Try using your own body to attract the zombies, sometimes you can sacrifice one to save more, sometimes some other things may be useful
 Quidome: action space is huge
 Alshock: well you can start with a simple decision tree, or make a simple GA
 Alshock: but most search algorithms will require a simulation
 Quidome: What do you mean by simulation is your sentence?
 Quidome: I see you managed to get to a descent position with python. Nice work!
 zophia2222: hey guys I just joined
 Quidome: hi there
 zophia2222: :money_mouth:
 zophia2222: I like TOMOEEEE
 peam: ok bro
 zophia2222: lol
 zophia2222: anyone there
 zophia2222: t???????????
 Washier: Quidome, simulating a game means you can do all sorts of things. I'm no expert but all the top guys\gals do it that way.
 zophia2222: hey
 zophia2222: what's up
 Washier: good and you rbto?
 Washier: *bro
 Wontonimo: just a reminder for the new people here: be respectful, talk about coding, keep the conversation on topic
 Alshock: @Quidome yes, by simulating I mean playing your actions and compute "what happens next" in the game. That way you can try stuff multiple times in a turn and see what happens.
 zophia2222: ok
 Quidome: @Alshock aha yes I do that
 Washier: @Alshock, well said
 BlaiseEbuth: OK friendly and respectful people! Who want to talk about the topic?
 zophia2222: who are we talking about???
 Alshock: You can go far with decision trees if done right. But you can always get farther by just telling your algorithm "try different stuff and keep the best"
 Wontonimo: hey Quidome, simulation means a faithful reproduction of the rules and state of the game.
 zophia2222: hello
 zophia2222: the person wants to know what's going on\
 zophia2222: took???
 zophia2222: ok??
 Quidome: yeah ok got it, zo the question is I do simulation which alorith to do zon code vs zombies
 Wontonimo: no spamming zophia2222.  use the scroll feature to look back
 zophia2222: I am not spamming I'm only 10 dude read my account
 Uljahn: we have the scroll feature? :scream_cat:
 Wontonimo: various algorithms will get you pretty far Quidome.  One that some people use is GA
 zophia2222: I prob don't have the feature I'm ten but look at the school
 Alshock: Quidome I suggest GA that's what I'm doing (that python code is bad though) because it won't be dissolved by all the paths possibilities
 Washier: this has to be said, you can also get quite far with good logic
 Wontonimo: +1 to that Washier
 Quidome: OK look into GA, I was trying MCTS
 Alshock: Yep, and good logic is NOT incompatible with simulation improving
 Wontonimo: and then you can wrap that good logic in a minimax to get a lookahead
 zophia2222: 0:&lt;
 Uljahn: branching is too high for MCTS i guess
 Washier: yes
 Alshock: You can try to prune it
 zophia2222: I need bff
 Quidome: Code vs zomboes on minimax doesnt look like a good idea to me&#160;:)
 Alzair: Hey good morning everyone, I have a question do you know if it's possible to have a close league with only friend for the MAP POD RACING? Or something close to this?
 Wontonimo: using MC instead of MCTS will also get you pretty far.
 Washier: for code vs zombies getting combos is really important if i remember well, hard to do with logic that
 Alshock: I think I read something about BFS with a lot of pruning about this puzzle
 zophia2222: idk
 Wontonimo: why would minimax not look like a good idea Quidome
 zophia2222: yah that's me dumdum
 Quidome: actionspace is huge
 Alshock: pruning, always pruning
 Wontonimo: zophia2222, this is a warning.  stay on topic or you will be given a timeout for about 5 min
 zophia2222: what is the topic wontonimio
 BlaiseEbuth: Before even pruning, just discretizing the moves is very important.
 Alshock: you don't want to get the absolute best you want to choose best between cases that don't seem to bad at first glance
 Washier: i get what @Quidome is saying. huge number of actions
 Smelty: j,,
 Alshock: that's already some kind of pruning imo BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Semantics... :p
 Alshock: but yeah, no trees with infinity
 zophia2222: there are maybe a lot of actions around here
 Wontonimo: imagine you have 3 different "ideas" for heuristic.  that becomes your action space.
 Wontonimo: just 3 in this case
 Washier: nice
 zophia2222: my sis is here
 Alshock: s/space/branching
 Wontonimo: I was just about to do that Uljahn.  thanks for kicking
 Washier: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: So much space! Need to see it all!
 Quidome: Can we kick someone out as member?
 Wontonimo: I do a similar thing for my Mars Lander 3 GA.  It doesn't do a GA search over all possible moves.  Instead it doe a GA search over all possible heuristics.  There are only 6 heuristics I have.
 BlaiseEbuth: So meta...
 Washier: very nice. never thought of that. ty
 jacek: GA eh
 Quidome: OK, i am gonna look into this GA thing first. Any links maybe?

 Quidome: Great link thnxs!
 aCat: :D
 Wontonimo: and this is a great article on GA <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/</a>
 BlaiseEbuth: Hm? Simple GA exercise?
 aCat: Yes, for marslander this article is great
 Wontonimo: it has something in it about analog blending of mutations ... really good sutff
 Wontonimo: made a HUGE difference for my mars lander
 Quidome: OK, thank you all, this will keep me busy for a while&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: here is a shameless self promotion&#160;: here is an npm package for genetic algorithm I made <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/geneticalgorithm">https://www.npmjs.com/package/geneticalgorithm</a>
 Wontonimo: it has examples of how to use it
 BlaiseEbuth: import genetic
 Washier: anyone else into the board games(checkers, othello)? Used to be an addiction for me, left it for a while, it's biting again. jacek is really good at it&#160;:)
 struct: a bit
 Washier: hehe
 jacek: oh my
 jacek: struct is lately into breakthrough again&#160;:?
 struct: maybe
 jacek: oh and im 2nd in oware&#160;:(
 struct: im making a gui using sfml and imgui
 Washier: i heard stories about struct.
 jacek: you may read about it in c++ or c# docs
 Washier: is it true struct, dp you delete your profile for fun?
 Washier: @jacek hehe
 struct: i needed to reach legend on a contest
 struct: or i had to delete
 jacek: in 1 submit
 struct: yes
 Washier: wow
 Wontonimo: i thought that was a rule.  num 1 or delete, doesn't everyone do that?
 struct: which game are you interested in Washier?
 Wontonimo: oh, nice rank Washier!  It was a personal accomplishment for me to break top 1000
 Washier: i did ok in checkers,othello. started with yavalath(?). lot to learn, especially things like BFS and the meta searching ideas mentioned here. the bug bites hard
 struct: Do you have a breakthrough bot?
 struct: i think i remember see your avatar on that arena
 struct: or maybe it was c4
 jacek: yavalath? shall we summon HIM?
 struct: cant remember
 struct: o.o
 Washier: if The Frog isn't in it, i have a chance of #1 in C#
 struct: rank 8 uses C#
 struct: it seems
 struct: But the bot is quite old
 struct: I have no idea about the strength of Yavalath bots
 Washier: it is an interesting game.
 struct: i only ported it to test SDK
 struct: it did well at the start
 Washier: but you know, I think to get better I will have to move to C. Agreed?
 struct: C# has release mode
 struct: not sure how close it is to C with it
 Washier: yeah me neither. but i am old. i trust C
 jacek: C# has pdep/pext not?
 Washier:&#160;:)
 Washier: i have been coding pro in C# for 15 years and i dont know what that is hehe
 struct: why do people use C instead of c++?
 Washier: i get that question. i like it because it is "clean". 
 jacek: intrinsic bit operations, rarely used in higher level languages
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pdep">https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/pdep</a>
 Washier: but you have those in C++\C#\java jacek?
 struct: useful instruction for the board games
 Wontonimo: very 
 struct: c++ has it
 jacek: it is useful in yavalath
 jacek: if you do bitboards in yavalath
 Washier: i only ever use bitboards
 jacek: in csb too? :v
 Washier: csb?
 struct: bt, c4 are best games to learn/improve bitboards
 struct: mad pod racing
 Wontonimo: csb = mad pod racing
 struct: or w/e its called now
 Washier: ah ty.
 Wontonimo: csb = coders strikes back (old name)
 Wontonimo: but because the lawyers here at CG got worried, they chaged the name
 Washier: no, lol, i'm obsessed with the board games again, in csb i tuned a pd controller
 Washier: (eyballed)
 jacek: obsessed with board games... we're twinsies
 Washier: why respect
 Washier: and some logic to ram oppo pods. i can imagine doing that with a GA, but I'm too lazy
 jacek: youre more like minimax guy or mcts
 Washier: moaarrr othello 
 Washier: minimax
 Washier: i tend to spend lots of time on eval function
 struct: so c4 is not the game for you
 struct: maybe bt?
 struct: I never tried minimax there though
 Washier: my searching is not deep enough(C# + skill)
 struct: minimax did rather well at the start of yavalath
 struct: but if you are going to use minimax you are going to have to beat trictrac minimax skills
 Washier: he uses C
 jacek: 1st guy in othello constantly tweets about it and its eval
 struct: you can even check his github
 Washier: really? dont twitter
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Nyanyan/OthelloAI_Textbook">https://github.com/Nyanyan/OthelloAI_Textbook</a>
 Washier: almost takes the fun out of it
 struct: well its not really copy paste ready
 struct: also I dont think his bot would be first without the book
 struct: dbdr or the NNs would
 Washier: i tried books. it helped but not sure i'm doing it right
 Washier: great info this ty
 struct: all my books are 1 ply
 Washier: ok. then i'm prolly doing it wrong
 struct: by 1 ply i mean i hardcode first move
 struct: I didnt want to confuse you :p
 Wontonimo: lol
 jacek: thats not deep book
 Washier: lol
 struct: if you dont want to worry about books you should try amazons
 struct: but you will have to prune 90% of the moves
 Washier: I sense there is some trick in this.
 struct: wdym?
 Washier: hehe
 Wontonimo: in spring challenge 2021 I didn't even consider most of the moves in the search.
 struct: I think I considered all
 Washier: hehe
 struct: but it was beam search so it doesnt matter much
 Wontonimo: i never made my BFS for that one
 Wontonimo: sorry beam search
 Wontonimo: mine was plain MC (not MCTS)
 Washier: yes i do, its not too bad when i checked last
 Washier: weird, yes I do have a breaktrough bot. plain minimax works really well for that.
 jacek: :tada:
 jacek: plain minimax? not even alphabeta?
 Washier: yes ok, alphabeta
 jacek: not even iterative deepening?
 Washier: with initial shallow search for move ordering
 Washier: my std approach. see now, spill the opening book secrets&#160;:)
 jacek: too many moves for opening books in bt
 Washier: no, haven't got to iterative deepening yet
 jacek: except for hardcoding those 2 standard opening from the author's paper
 Washier: ty
 zophia2222: hi lets
 Washier: &lt;writes it down&gt;
 Washier: now do Othello opening book advice&#160;:)

 zophia2222: the thing that got my mind is the code for coding like I'm brand new (:
 zophia2222: sorry
 zophia2222: who wants to join my code talk club
 jacek: for bt if you use bitboards, you can quite cheaply check for win/lose for within 3(4) plies
 zophia2222: really
 zophia2222:&#160;?
 zophia2222: thanks good advice
 Washier: noted
 zophia2222: (:&gt;
 Wontonimo: here zophia2222, click this link #codeTalkClub and talk about code there
 zophia2222: I did that
 zophia2222: check!
 zophia2222: Chat_all_day_long
 zophia2222: search that
 Washier: @jacek, will have to check what i did in bt. long time ago. must.improve
 zophia2222: )::::))::::
 Wontonimo: cut it out zophia2222, your comments are not adding to the flow of conversation
 Wontonimo: here is another time out.  the next one is a ban
 jacek: oO
 Washier: Oo
 struct: yeah i shared my early win check
 struct: i dont mind sharing it again
 struct: from 5th row is possible
 struct: but its a bit more tricky
 struct: but eval is probably the trickiest part of bt
 struct: i have no idea how to code it
 jacek: because youre too materialisic
 struct: nah
 struct: my bot usually ends up with less captured pawns
 struct: mobility is probably important but I'm not sure
 CatboyCodes: sup
 CatboyCodes: how is everyone doing?
 Washier: its friday, pretty good here 
 Washier: @struct, are you talking about bt?
 struct: yes
 struct: my eval is a mess
 Washier: please do &lt;eep bow&gt;
 struct: 100 lines
 CatboyCodes: he to send a feedback?
 CatboyCodes: *how
 Washier: O-O
 Wontonimo: go onto discord CatboyCodes.  there are channels there.  the link for discord is at the top of the window
 struct: Washier also i use mcts not minimax
 struct: but minimax is probably better here
 struct: I just dont know minimax well enough
 jacek: winter olympics soon eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_vzyHNpJEiLNwyqYQKTXWEGDHk27MWkqv.gif">https://www.wykop.pl/cdn/c3201142/comment_vzyHNpJEiLNwyqYQKTXWEGDHk27MWkqv.gif</a>
 struct: jacek before the NN bot it was minimax right?
 struct: your bt bot
 jacek: yes
 Nachosauce: Wontonimo! I remember you. Back when I was trying to become a developer you gave me some tips. Happy to report, I've done it! Been a developer since May&#160;:) 
 jacek: i had eval for piece value, piece-square table, penalty for attacked unprotected pawn etc.
 jacek: nice
 Wontonimo: HEY HEY Nachosauce&#160;!!  That's wonderful to hear&#160;!!  :TADA::TADA:
 Wontonimo: :TADA: 
 jacek: fail
 Wontonimo: :tada:
 Wontonimo: so much fail
 jacek: mods cannot into emoji
 struct: mods only need to know /ban
 Nachosauce: Also happy to report, I'm very happy with the jump I made. Took a pay cut to get into development but I'm so much happier doing this over what I was doing. 
 Wontonimo: hopefully you'll more than undo that paycut in about 2 years with a pay raise
 Wontonimo: 2 years is a big turning point in pay/experience for programmers
 Nachosauce: Probably won't take that long. Where I'm at pays poorly, people that started with me have already jumped companies and are making more than I used to. I like it here though so I'm trying to pressure them into paying up :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I'm sure it won't go well, but gotta try!
 Smelty: huh
 Wontonimo: nice, very nice.  What was your method of skilling-up?  or said another way, what would you suggest to someone wanting to repeat your success?
 struct: jacek have you ever tried ntuples on bt?
 Washier: O-O
 Nachosauce: Don't be afraid to ask questions. Google like a madman. Take on harder projects than you think you can handle, and repeat the above two to get it done!
 jacek: struct in my early attempts before NN i tried 3x3 ntuples
 Washier: NN O-O
 jacek: trained via simple td-learning. it was comparable with my hand tuned eval
 Washier: for eval function?
 Washier: ty
 jacek: most my board games bots are mcts/ept + NN
 jacek: or jacekmax
 Washier: hehe
 Washier: noice
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/55004/best-first-minimax-search-with-uct</a>
 Washier: noice
 Washier: just a random questio&#160;: how does an article like that compare to a masters\doctoral, thingy?
 Washier: it is a novel way of searching some space, so I would guess close to master level?
 jacek: huh? this would be merely a chapter in masters thesis at most
 jacek: and apparently its not so novel
 Washier: oh ok. lol
 Xylight: can someone help? i pass all test except one
 Xylight: Stock Exchange Losses
 Xylight: Large dataset (n = 99999) i dont pass this one
 Wontonimo: why?  time out?
 Xylight: no wrong answer
 Xylight: Found: -943415033Expected: -1073730311
 Xylight: but only this one
 Wontonimo: just checking my answer ... what the heck did i code this in php?
 Xylight: haha :D
 Xylight: i did in js
 Wontonimo: ah, looking at my typescript solution
 Wontonimo: there really isn't much too it
 Wontonimo: don't know what to say
 Wontonimo: i can't replicate your issue
 Xylight: Yes exactly... that's why I'm surprised
 Xylight: basic logic and it should work 
 Xylight:&#160;:/
 jacek: int overflow?
 Xylight: no
 Wontonimo: write out your solution in english pseudo code here ... skipping reading in init code
 Wontonimo: like, just the main loop

 Xylight: can't find anything either?
 Wontonimo: okay, plug this data into your code10 9 8 7 8 9 10
 Wontonimo: what would it respond with?
 Xylight: wait
 Wontonimo: it should respond with -3, but your pseudo code looks like it would respond with 0
 Xylight: yea i'm getting 0
 Xylight: but why
 Wontonimo: because you are not tracking the lowest value.  if you've hit a new low, you need to also append losses
 zophia2222: hi
 Xylight: i am with the if or not?
 Xylight: if e &gt; last high
 Xylight: oh no
 Wontonimo: where is last low?
 Wontonimo:&#160;:)
 Xylight: I got confused give me a sec xD
 Xylight: okay it worked now the last test is not working but im working on the error

 Xylight: sure
 zophia2222: how do we do it

 Jkurutu: Hi community, new to the platform. I am doing tutorials codes before taking a test. I built the code in my IDE first, and typing the same code into the CodinGame engine, it fails on a complex test case. Like print 5 instead of 2 for the closest number to 0, and the code prints 2 in my IDE testing it with something like -5 2 5.Is this a common issue to experience... or I should keep looking for bugs? Thanks
 jacek: temperatures?
 Jkurutu: Yeap. Temperatures.
 zophia2222: hi
 jacek: 2 is closer to 0 than -5 or 5, so it should be 2. if your code prints 5 then there is a bug
 struct: its weird that your ide result is different
 struct: if its the same code
 struct: which inputs are you using on your ide?
 Jkurutu: The same code in my IDE printf 2. But the code in CodinGame does show 5 tho. So.. maybe more than a lil confused
 Jkurutu: Input; {-5, 2, 5}
 Big_Code: hey folks, quick question, how can I assign a variable a number within a range? For example,x = y + 1, y + 2, y + 3 
 Big_Code: Oop I didnt mean to send that just yet, but mostly done
 Big_Code: Oh yea I just answered my own question I think, ignore me :grin: 
 jacek: :duck:
 Wontonimo: :quack:
 struct: Jkurutu can you share the code?
 Sillverre: he probably saw their mistake
 Jkurutu: should I just type it out in the chat box?
 BadBurger: python, in class has __str__ that when called the class object without anything, runs the __str__ function, does javascript have something similiar?

 struct: Jkurutu the example you said works on the ide
 struct: the -5 2 5
 struct: one
 Jkurutu: That's the one, sorry. ``` n is the range; = 3input; = -5 5 2```
 struct: it still passed at least with the code you pasted
 struct: 3-5 5 2
 struct: output was 2
 struct: did you enable expert mode on ide?

 Apollo10: What does "Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur." mean?
 5DN1L: It means that your code reads fewer inputs than originally intended before you print your outputs

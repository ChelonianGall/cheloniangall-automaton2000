 Karl-EerikOtstavel: Hey
 TrashCoder22: anyone on?
 TrashCoder22: i need help for sre
 jacek: good morning
 LeBaoHoang8A4: good
 Zachary_0722: hey
 TheSpiffiest: Just realized it's missing "R" language
 TheSpiffiest: I have to learn that for my new job
 TheSpiffiest: They are doing 3d graphics with it.
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: 3D data visualisation I hope. Either that they're insane :P
 TheSpiffiest: Yep.  3JS and giant data sets
 jacek: JS? :scream:
 TheSpiffiest: I didn't write it, but I'm tasked with rewriting it.
 YCS-Venom: Hello world
 ntsd: Hi Community
 m.amin: hello
 ntsd: I wanna practice English can anyone voice chat with me?
 Nghia64582: no
 AntiSquid: hi ntsd long time no see
 MOSTAFA: Hello 
 MOSTAFA: How to get other player Code to learn more
 MOSTAFA: i am playing 
 MOSTAFA: so i would like like to get other players so i can improve
 ntsd: You need to pass it first
 MOSTAFA: i did
 MOSTAFA: i got 75&#160;%
 ntsd: then you'll see other code in same language
 ntsd: you need 100%
 MOSTAFA: from where
 Astrobytes: Have you checked out the 'Hints' button on the left MOSTAFA?
 MOSTAFA: no
 MOSTAFA: what is Hints
 Astrobytes: Press it and see&#160;;)
 MOSTAFA: oh i didn't know that Directions work as a string here and i can assign it to a other sting 
 MOSTAFA: thx man 
 Astrobytes: No problem 
 NewfieBullet: What time does the rank reset happen for clash of code?
 DaBestest: Right now I'm playing King George's three songs from Hamilton on repeat while I try to finish up a huge project on Scratch I'm making with a bunch of friends for a contest...
 jacek: good for you
 MSmits: jacek, what happened on Othello?
 MSmits: did tric trac and robo submit a better version or&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Submitted before coffee by the looks of things :P
 MSmits: I fixed up my AVX last night
 MSmits: pretty sizable boost to performance
 MSmits: not much difference in rating I think though
 Astrobytes: Is that your current version?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: still very simple eval
 Astrobytes: Hm yeah, doesn't seem to have improved your position much. Wait til your eval is better, then it might count for more
 Astrobytes: Your eval is just mobility + corners?
 MSmits: mostly yes
 MSmits: now using up to 16 million nodes in turn 1 and then over a million nodes each turn
 MSmits: my node pool is 22 million, sooo not much tree-reuse 
 Washier: :open_mouth:
 Astrobytes: Nice
 MSmits: it's kinda funny, Robo evals 3k nodes per turn and I eval 1 million.  His bot beats mine by far
 MSmits: shows how important eval is huh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, for sure
 MSmits: but i am pretty sure my search type is just fine. No need for minimax
 MSmits: not even done fitting the 4 parameters I do ha e
 MSmits: have
 Astrobytes: Did you get frontiers working?
 MSmits: i havent tried again
 Astrobytes: It's a strange parameter
 MSmits: if its only useful in early game then I don't want to put too much effort into it
 Astrobytes: Seems useful throughout, you see a lot of games where it's mostly quiet moves then a big BAM! at the end
 MSmits: yeah but how do you know it's frontier&#160;?
 Washier: was wondering earlier, how do you think the top othello bots will fare against the greats like Logistello, given the time limit?
 MSmits: the reason it is not a fair comparison is that the evals here use hardcoded ntuple-tables and similar. Logistello has a far larger codespace for this
 Astrobytes: minimising your frontier discs means a quieter move
 MSmits: so we use smaller ntuples and such
 Washier: ok
 MSmits: not me, but I guess at some point I might
 MSmits: what do you mean quieter?
 Astrobytes: flipping less frontier discs
 Astrobytes: And creating less
 MSmits: but isnt that the same as giving your opponent less mobility?
 MSmits: I think it might interfere with the mobility eval
 Astrobytes: yes, they're related
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: thats the problem I think
 Astrobytes: It's also known as potential mobility
 Astrobytes: Finding the balance with these two is tricky
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 Astrobytes: For me at least
 Astrobytes: Just started working on it again after a break
 MSmits: I should probably also look at other eval features like disc stability
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I need to do that also. Been lazy
 Astrobytes: I conditionally evaluate the C and X squares
 Astrobytes: By corner occupancy that is
 Washier: i alos tried that, didnt help me.
 Washier: but, fark, im still struggling with itterative deepening, so dont listen to me
 MSmits: C and X I did make work
 MSmits: it's a bit tricky to make sure you dont punish yourself when you have a corner and also the squares next to it
 MSmits: X squares are only bad when the corner is still free
 Astrobytes: Yeah exactly that
 inoryy: why won't you guys write down your progress in blog posts and the likes?
 eulerscheZahl: sounds easier to follow than chat activity spread over days if not weeks
 Astrobytes: I don't particularly feel worthy of blogging tbh, Smits definitely should
 DomiKo: i guess inorry's idea is really cool
 inoryy: it would also immensly help with potential career switches down the line
 MSmits: it's good advice inoryy, thanks
 Astrobytes: Fair point
 MSmits: Astrobytes, your bot doesn't have to be the best bot to be worthy of blogging. I think many good blogs just follow a path of improvement. Doesn't matter if it leaves out the very last bit that gets you from rank 10 to rank 3 or something
 HeaDTy: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1293621fdd42d4cf6c3e1ec35addaad8aae04ef">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1293621fdd42d4cf6c3e1ec35addaad8aae04ef</a>
 eulerscheZahl: no HeaDTy
 HeaDTy: Ok sry
 DomiKo: if not "shortest mode" i can try
 Astrobytes: Yes, I guess that's true MSmits
 inoryy: Astrobytes everyone thinks this way; the reality is that a top100 bot with a detailed blog post is more valuable than a #1 with no info
 MSmits: very true
 inoryy: both for the community and for the blogger
 Astrobytes: You do have a point there, yep
 MSmits: I'm trying to find a good function to calculate stable disks now
 MSmits: i think that could be important
 Astrobytes: It seemed like it might be a little 'involved', hence me not doing it yet :P
 MSmits: it should be similar to generating and resolving moves
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it is, with a few additional bits
 Astrobytes: 'bits'
 MSmits: yep
 inoryy: Astrobytes a real-world example -- Magus CSB blog post has been an invaluable resource for everyone from #1 to #200+ while his own bot basically floats from top50 to top100 based on who submit spams
 MSmits: you've convinced everyone inoryy&#160;:)
 Washier: not sure if it can work here, but on kaggle anybody can share code with the community in the form of a working entry they can submit. as long as people dont share insanely good scripts, everybody wins, but not all people would agree. 
 Astrobytes: Hm, that's a good example actually. I'll see what I can do.
 MSmits: it's a delicate balance between sharing and competition Washier
 MSmits: hard to say where the exact line is
 eulerscheZahl: also depends on the game and approach to it."wrote some if-else bot" rarely makes a good post IMO
 Washier: yup. and people have fought over it a lot.
 MSmits: unless it's an introduction to the game and is followed up by more nuanced evaluations 
 eulerscheZahl: the CSB bible rebuilds the engine and makes a good blog article that way. i didn't even care about the GA part of it
 Astrobytes: Building blocks, yes
 eulerscheZahl: then again with public referee the CSB blog post would be less interesting to me. it just tells us what CG missed to state
 MSmits: there are 3 types of things that would be interesting to blog it seems to me
 MSmits: 1) Strategic stuff pertaining to the game. How do you win? Regardless of the way it's coded
 MSmits: 2) Explaining how search types work
 eulerscheZahl: 3) your lunch that explains social media
 MSmits: 3) Implementation of algorithms
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 MSmits: or that
 MSmits: why would my lunch explain social media
 Washier: haha
 Washier: i would love to read 2) MSmits
 MSmits: it's funny even though i dont get it :P
 MSmits: I think I prefer to write specific guides as opposed to writing a blog while I am still figuring things out
 dbdr: sounds like a perfectionist mind :0
 MSmits: when i am still figuring it out i prefer to chat about it so i get advice
 MSmits: well that too
 inoryy: you could write down intermediate results
 MSmits: thats a good idea
 MSmits: thats what people do in post mortems sometimes
 jacek: writing blogs could also work as rubber duck debugging
 jacek: i wonder how many bugs i would discover if i were to review my code and logic
 jacek: and yes, i posted inferior bot, im looking between weight number balance vs their usefulness
 Astrobytes: Coming to Wood 1 then DomiKo?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes i write my post mortem during the contest. it helps me to reflect what i'm doing, found a few bugs that way
 jacek: so its in mortem then
 Astrobytes: antemortem
 MSmits: nice one eulerscheZahl. Also might be a way to battle losing interest.
 MSmits: a bit of variation from staring at code and getting little progress
 kovi: yes, but there is a different point of view: it you can't win in, at least you can teach it
 Washier: your progress looks pretty good from here.
 Astrobytes: DomiKo is absolutely wrecking Wood 2
 MSmits: good
 kovi: but as msmits wrote sometimes, summarizing what is done/known can help reveal new ideas
 MSmits: btw kovi, did you come here for a spefic multi? I don't see you active much outside contests
 MSmits: specific that is
 eulerscheZahl: kovi knows something we don't know yet
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 MSmits: i imagine he knows many things
 Washier: sorry MSmits, i meant excellent. (goed in afrikaans is meer komplimenterend)
 jacek: can jet fuel melt steel beams?
 MSmits: no I meant good that dominik is coming into wood 1 :P
 DomiKo: yap :D
 Washier: oh crap
 Astrobytes: gg dude, great submit
 MSmits: domiko sry
 DomiKo: but no worries
 DomiKo: not right now ;P
 DomiKo: WAshier 1:0 for me 
 Washier: haha. move along, nothing to see here
 DomiKo: haha
 Washier: smashing me
 Washier: oof
 Washier: taking al 4 corners, both times
 Washier: me prediction, 7-sh
 Washier: *7-ish
 DomiKo: then it will end i will push better version
 DomiKo: when*
 Astrobytes: god help us all&#160;:)
 Washier: at the end
 Washier: of submit
 vfpx07: Do Python users have an advantage when doing least characters possible?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/476998805">https://www.codingame.com/replay/476998805</a>
 DomiKo: okey
 MSmits: I need more c++ to test against, keep going Domiko&#160;:)
 DomiKo: MSmits
 DomiKo: bug?
 eulerscheZahl: depends over whom vfpx07
 DomiKo: how i won 
 DomiKo: haha
 Washier: wd
 MSmits: lemme see that
 eulerscheZahl: python wins in shortest vs Javabut most likely loses vs bash
 MSmits: why bug?
 DomiKo: i didn't think that could happend
 MSmits: bot detected loss at frame 47
 DomiKo:&#160;:(
 MSmits: I have had wins against people 6 rating up... there's still such a thing as random luck and rps effects&#160;:)
 DomiKo: 2:0 for me 
 DomiKo: that's not luck!
 DomiKo: haha
 MSmits: rps maybe then
 Washier: happened to me before believe it or not. once beat LeRenard. freak game
 DomiKo: what is rps?
 DomiKo: wow
 MSmits: rock paper scissors
 DomiKo: ohhh
 MSmits: you're rock and I'm scissors
 MSmits: and everyone else is paper. Well except top 4 :P
 DomiKo: haha
 DomiKo: gotcha
 MSmits: could be that if i change one parameter by a tiny bit, the rock is gone
 MSmits: it's like that in many games
 MSmits: thats why i always test against multiple players
 MSmits: yep, you rock
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i hate board games with a static setup
 eulerscheZahl: maps need randomness in geenration
 MSmits: ye ye we got it, Onitama is great :P
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't planning to say or imply that
 MSmits: it's still true
 Astrobytes: Alright, so we make a version of othello where you randomly swap sides at random intervals in the game just for euler :P
 Washier: final push for 7. cmon
 DomiKo: RNG lets go!
 MSmits: what happened with tomatoes btw
 Washier: or opening books
 eulerscheZahl: no, random for map generation. not during the game
 MSmits: pretty sure his rating was better
 Astrobytes: It was
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-othello-1/DomiKo">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-othello-1/DomiKo</a>
 Astrobytes: Alright, so we have areas of squares in both colours randomly distributed at the start of the game
 DomiKo: i have no chance with top7
 DomiKo: WOW
 DomiKo: Washier
 DomiKo: how
 Washier: touche
 DomiKo: you god
 Washier: wut
 DomiKo: i end up at 7...
 DomiKo: how you guessed that
 Washier: wish i had less intuition and more brains
 DomiKo: hahah
 Washier: its a toit 7 tho. will change
 DomiKo: yea
 nguyenletienbao: input $8.90
 nguyenletienbao: Expected output
 nguyenletienbao: 8 3 1 1 0
 nguyenletienbao: how to handle this?
 fvla: integer division
 WINWINWIN: Number of 1 dollar, number of 25 cent, number of 10 cent, number of 5 cent, number of 1 cent
 Washier: guess 8 $ bills, 3 quarters etc
 nguyenletienbao: can u explain more clearly
 fvla: is this reverse engineering
 WINWINWIN: Consider a amount that you want to convert into change.
 WINWINWIN: The denominations you have are: 1dollar, 25 cent, 10 cent, 5 cent, 1 cent
 Jackie_Truong: :grinning:
 WINWINWIN: print how many of each you need.
 nguyenletienbao: got it:grinning:
 AnirudhPatel: There is a puzzle marked with a neural network. has anyone here done it?
 sparky: which puzzle?
 JulesCesarTCHUISSEU: hello
 NinjaCarnivoreAndHisDog_c7bf: hello guys
 WINWINWIN: Think he means csb
 DaBestest: who's watched Hamilton on Disney+?
 TheSpiffiest: Ha. I keep going off on tangets in code clash. I can solve it in a minute, but then I think wait... there's an algorithm that will do this in one go that's more interesting.
 TheSpiffiest: regular expressions on the brain

 tomatoes: It’s so close! The South Pole Wall is just half a billion light-years away :slight_smile:
 Hjax: so.... the universe is flat? :P
 Astrobytes: lol, was just waiting on flat earther jokes :D
 TheSpiffiest: It's just one axis less than anticipated... flat squared?&#160;:)
 AbundantPuddle: The earth is flat and the universe is a one dimensional hot dog.
 wild: true
 Hankdane: But is it a wiener or a frankfurter dog?
 TheSpiffiest: So what is ranking?  My levels are going up, but ranking seems to be unchanged.
 TheSpiffiest: Oh - just read it's updated once a day. Disregard. 
 AbundantPuddle: It is both neither and both or neither.
 AbundantPuddle: :thinking:
 FLQ4: ok 
 FLQ4: lol
 FLQ4: xD
 Schwase: good day for solving puzzles
 Masterpiece: is there anyone who would like to do contest with me in code forces&#160;?
 WildOrangutan: What does "banana"[1::2] do?
 jacek: start from index 1 and take every 2 letters
 jacek: so aaa
 tomatoes: [start:stop:step]
 WildOrangutan: aaah, thanks
 msbonillao-mill: [;ist&lt;Node
 DomiKo: Othello is hard&#160;:/
 DomiKo: hmmm maybe i will push tomotoes 
 DomiKo: ohhh

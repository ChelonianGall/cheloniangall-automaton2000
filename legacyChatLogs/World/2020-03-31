 izik1: beauty 
 Zenoscave: what is that izik1
 izik1: See the image for the shape that a torp can fire given some obstacles?
 izik1: That's that, but I did the logic without any kind of queue
 izik1: Which is nice for me
 Zenoscave: how'd you do it?
 izik1: layering
 Zenoscave: nice
 izik1: I stared at ascii art of diamonds for a while
 izik1: the neighbor check is nice too
 izik1: because bitmask
 Scarfield: that seems like something you should not have shared during the contest :p im maybe gonna steal it, nice idea!
 izik1: Honestly, I'd be shocked if nobody else came up with it
 izik1: I'm not even sure if it's the most efficient way
 eulerscheZahl: i just cache which cells are in range of each other at turn 0. so i don't see a need to optimize for speed using bitmasks
 izik1: So you just make a LUT for every possible torp position?
 eulerscheZahl: a LUT?
 izik1: Look up Table
 eulerscheZahl: cell =&gt; int[,] dist to other cells
 eulerscheZahl: and dist &lt;= 4 means that i can shoot
 izik1: What about walls?
 eulerscheZahl: dist is a BFS
 izik1: ah
 izik1: Don't you still need to find which cells are &lt;= 4?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, i have to compare the dist to 4. but i'm far away from the 50ms, so why should i bother?
 Scarfield: for each cell he stores a table of the distances (found with BFS) for all of the cells, as i understand
 izik1: yeah, but you still need to floodfill or whatever for  checking distance, if you're using it for prediction
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;?
 izik1: if you want to use opponent torps to check where opponent is
 Scarfield: not if you did it beforehand, the distances are stored
 izik1: yeah, but the _mask_ isn't
 eulerscheZahl: i have a List&lt;Cell&gt; with possible opponent candidates
 izik1: we're going from &gt;= 4 to true/false
 eulerscheZahl: then i do: candidates.Where( c =&gt; c.CurrentPosition.InTorpedoRange(explosion))
 izik1: I mean, I guess you could just use the comparision
 eulerscheZahl: of course i could cache it as a boolean instead of dist to gain a bit of speed
 izik1: Honestly, I think I'm going to make a lookup table for all cells at the start, since it's only 2*15^2 = 450 bytes of storage if stored optimally, 512 if not
 eulerscheZahl: but so far it really doesn't matter
 izik1: yeah...
 Scarfield: any idea how many has started searching for OoC yet? 
 izik1: bleh, I need to fix my bundler
 izik1: so that it doesn't bundle tests lol
 Scarfield: or searching in OoC *
 izik1: oof, #2 by 0.34 points
 eulerscheZahl: so you can already smell the mines
 izik1: I'm hoping to get into bronze without using anything but torps lol
 izik1: and a really sucky movement algo
 izik1: and a super advanced opponent tracker, of course
 wlesavo: finally reasonable 44% against ko vi
 eulerscheZahl: your tracking can't be super advanced before bronze (when you have to track mines)
 Marchete: any recommendation of strategy for the game?
 Marchete: I'm not into it
 Marchete: but if I someday have some time
 eulerscheZahl: bruteforce opponent positions, heuristic movements i think
 izik1: euler: I can back in time even if there are no mines to track
 izik1: and _technically_ I _can_ track mines
 Marchete: is bitmaps noticeable?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, i don't use them
 Marchete: or I can go to simpler structures
 Marchete: ok
 izik1: I find the bitmap to be the simpler structure, but that's probably just me
 Marchete: vector&lt;&gt;, arrays  and stuff then
 eulerscheZahl: for some players constantly doing SILENCE i struggle and have to prune a bit
 eulerscheZahl: usually not needed
 Marchete: a lot of players in the game
 izik1: just 2, but you don't know where they are 
 eulerscheZahl: be one of them
 izik1: oh, that's what you're talking about
 eulerscheZahl: 1245 players so far
 Marchete: I'm not really in the mood
 Marchete: butr maybe later
 eulerscheZahl: 1244 if i don't count illedan + illestream as 2
 Marchete: it seems there are many non C++ in top10
 Marchete: cool
 izik1: 1243 if you don't count me because I suck .-.
 eulerscheZahl: is it the leagues you dislike Marchete?
 Marchete: that too
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/demo/8392839245e18c46e2dac324152a05070dcc91">https://www.codingame.com/demo/8392839245e18c46e2dac324152a05070dcc91</a>
 Marchete: coding a cripple bot to have bronze
 eulerscheZahl: i voted for a CHEAT command to instantly win in wood
 izik1: I don't really cripple my bot :v
 izik1: I mean, I'm intentionally not implementing some things that I could
 izik1: but why would I waste dev time on a bot that I'll scrap?
 Marchete: I dislike do it in parts
 izik1: mm
 Marchete: doing
 k4ng0u: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/443953550">https://www.codingame.com/replay/443953550</a>So wanted to check top ai bots path detection... Apprarently kovi can go up to 50-60k paths, I personnally timeout at 5k...
 eulerscheZahl: i start pruning at 1k :D
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i could go a little higher - also depends on the path length covered
 eulerscheZahl: but you found a way to beat some players, submit time :D
 izik1: Ah, gotta track their life now, ran into a situation where they hit themselves with torp
 k4ng0u: I am getting nowhere with this one :P with a lot of fake accounts maybe I can lock down some players in the lower ranks :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: do the silence for the first few turns, then play for real if the opponent doesn't want to crash
 Marchete: what happens with silence on wood?
 Marchete: it does something?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, in wood1 it does
 Marchete: I mean, bronze bot can work the same on wood?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Marchete: or it will WAIT instead?
 Marchete: or crash?
 eulerscheZahl: crash
 Marchete: yay
 Marchete: so cooldowns tweaks
 eulerscheZahl: but the contest will be pushed directly into the multiplayer area
 eulerscheZahl: with all contestants
 eulerscheZahl: no more saving wood code just for promotion
 eulerscheZahl: no more missing top players
 Marchete: that's great
 Marchete: with 20 days I'll do the same top players did in 3 :D
 eulerscheZahl: and you have these 20 days&#160;:)
 Marchete: yeah, 3 days worth of good coders :D
 izik1: Hey, that's gotta be like 30 days of me
 izik1: :p
 eulerscheZahl: Marchete might not be the fastestbut when he got into it, he's constantly beating me
 eulerscheZahl: same goes for smits
 izik1: _sigh_, the one downside of bitmaps is that I keep accidentally masking out the wrong extra bit
 izik1: I should just make a `MAP_ROW_MASK` const
 izik1: so that I stop doing that
 Marchete: because you just get bored and stop working on it
 izik1: I'm a derp, I wrote a thing to predict opponent health and _totally_ forgot to account for my own torps
 izik1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443958939">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443958939</a> lol, okay, so I need to make  my spawning slightly less naive too I guess
 izik1: Like, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443959095">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/443959095</a> seriously
 dbdr: the player 2 advantage
 izik1: tfw I make my bot better but get a worse rank and lose more&#160;;-;
 AntiSquid: there's player advantage for this game?
 izik1: Yeah, if you both spawn trapped player 2 wins
 izik1: See both of those replays
 dbdr: otherwise, I think small player 1 advantage
 dbdr: you can shoot once earlier
 AntiSquid: isn't p2 at advantage, they are the first to get enemy movement as input?
 izik1: I think the general case should be a wash then?
 dbdr: another factor, true
 izik1: p1 gets extra charge, p2 gets input
 izik1: p1 gets better map control
 dbdr: but p1 at turn 3 has again more info
 izik1: but not as much as p2 has at turn 4 :p
 eulerscheZahl: izik1 08:19AM"and a super advanced opponent tracker, of course"
 dbdr: well, 1 info from p2 move, that's symmetrical, but also his info from his previous action
 eulerscheZahl: hm, not that advanced after all?&#160;;)
 dbdr: so I still vote for p1
 izik1: lol
 izik1: Call it a bug in the advanced opponent tracker :p
 AntiSquid: are the bots at the top constantly improving or just shuffling the ladder?
 Csipcsirip: yesterday I subbmitted a 2days old rank6 code and it ended up at rank15
 Zpooks: Is someone able to provide a hint or pointer to how I should approach "roaming" (which I guess is my current plan) for Ocean of code?
 Zpooks: I can pathfind to something i know where it is, but not sure how to apply it when the enemy isnt yet located and I need to just roam around.
 izik1: Think tron or snake in that case
 izik1: (you don't want to hit yourself, or force yourself to surface)
 Zpooks: Alright, i'll start there. Thanks&#160;:)
 izik1: Not that I actually do that lol, I have the stupidest movement possible
 izik1: Hopefully about to graduate wood on my tracker alone
 Zpooks: Haven't progressed past Cpt. Levine yet haha
 Quidome: In the leader board some have a green dot on the picture what does that mean?
 AntiSquid: premium membership
 wlesavo: guys, when i use cg enhancer sometimes i lose all comments and ranks in submit history, why would that be?
 Uljahn: AntiSquid: coronavirus infected
 dbdr: Quidome: green dot = online
 Quidome: Ah, thnxs&#160;:)
 izik1: Now you too can spy on the fact that I never shut my computer down :p
 izik1: Oh, it's 2 in the morning, I should probably sleep after this submit finishes going through
 izik1: fixed _another_ bug with my tracker, I keep getting coordinate spaces mixed up, since I have like... at least 3 to keep track of sometimes
 Zpooks: I don't see how that could *ever* happen :upside_down:
 daffie: in coders strike back does anyone know the acceleration value or can it be calculated knowing the friction value??
 AntiSquid: Quidome already sent you a private message before dbdr, just didn't want to go offtopic in here
 izik1: Hmm, tomorrow I'll try time travel, if that doesn't get me out of wood, I'll give up on only torps / bad movement / good tracking and throw in some silence
 Revhack: Hello all, I'm new here
 Tunga: Greetings fellas 
 Tunga: Welcome Revhack 
 Revhack: Where are you from?
 Tunga: If you hover on my avatar 
 Tunga: Turkey 
 Revhack: Ouh cool, I'm from Indonesia
 Tunga: Nice to hear that
 Tunga: This is a practice website for coding and also competitive ai bot matches also happening here 
 Tunga: How old are you Revhack
 yfprojects: If go to /home you cn see some puzzle suggestions Revhack
 AntiSquid: Revhack you need an avatar
 yfprojects: AntiSquid for what?
 AntiSquid: to avoid confusion
 Tunga: AntiSquid are you a staff on codinggame or just a regular user 
 Tunga: Damn internet is so slow, everyone using it instead going out :p 
 Uljahn: staff has [CG] in their nicks
 Tunga: Nice info
 Tunga: Thanks Uljahn!
 struct: Its not your internet, its chat
 Tunga: I was talking about my internet&#160;:( 
 struct: But chat is slow too
 struct: sometimes you type and message only goes after n secoinds
 AntiSquid: i would have put codingame in my bio if that was the case Tunga
 Tunga: You are right struct 
 Tunga: I dont know that, that is why I asked AntiSquid 
 Tunga: I like this place, it is alive
 Tunga: Damn hackerrank was empty and sad. This chat feature is brilliant idea along with discord 
 Quidome: Yes, just hit silver, full rebuild from python to java :D, I am happyWithout using Silence and Mines ...
 aangairbender: Quidome top2 player Nagrarok doenst use silence btw
 aangairbender: and sonar
 Quidome: Really... Cool
 Evedel: Keep this language/league interpolation, the legend one is pure C, right?
 struct: I dont think I understand
 AntiSquid: Evedel there's a python bot on #6
 Quidome: Top players all use heavy mine strategies so it looks. 
 Quidome: Got to focus on that :D
 AntiSquid: probably
 Evedel: Yep, that was more like a joke. I'm pretty comfortable with python too, especially when there is more heuristic then have number-crunching
 Evedel: heavy
 jrke: heavyyy:joy:
 AntiSquid: i would have expected this to give an error:TORPEDO 10 4 | | MOVE N TORPEDO
 AntiSquid: but it's perfectly valid it seems
 struct: yes
 struct: but before it created a tooltip
 struct: doesnt create anymore
 struct: even ||||||||||||||||||||||MOVE N TORPEDO is valid
 emh: pb4 you there? got just over a million BFS per 50ms with new method :D
 AntiSquid: and it's still not enough for #1 place?
 struct: wtf
 struct: are you doing emh?
 struct: I undertand if you dont want to reveal
 struct: but are you going to talk about it after contest ends?
 emh: well my submission is still C#
 emh: don't have any bot logic in my C++ yet
 emh: just BFSes heheheheh and bit grids
 pb4: Yes I'm here
 pb4: That's fast :D
 emh: pb4 should I share the secret sauce with everyone? I already described it a bit in chat here yesterday but maybe it was not specific enough hehe
 AntiSquid: are you going to swap to c++ for 2 mil bfs?
 pb4: Your call emh&#160;:)
 emh: AntiSquid the 1 mill is C++
 pb4: I don't think it matters much in this contest
 struct: I am interested, but I can wait until contest ends
 struct: AntiSquid if he switched from C# to C++ it would be 10 times faster
 pb4: If you're motivated by a small write-up I'm sure many people will be interested
 pb4: You can show the various possibilities you tried in the write-up
 AntiSquid: struct then he should switch to D, someone said it's 10 times faster than C++
 emh: well, basically it's just 2 lines from which you can deduce the rest. I can give the 2 lines now and maybe writeup later
 emh: we use 4 64 bit as before, but fill them with bits using these 2 lines:
 emh: intIndex = (x&#160;% 2) + ((y&#160;% 2) * 2);
 AntiSquid: 'we'
 emh: I
 emh: hehe
 emh: well me and pb4 and probably others too use 4 x 64 bits
 emh: and WP is 16
 emh: any questions?
 emh: if the indices of the 4 64 bit ints are 0,1,2 and 3, then the bits on the board are placed into them as follows:
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1094afd-8452-44da-804c-ae63e06ca8da">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b1094afd-8452-44da-804c-ae63e06ca8da</a>
 emh: you can see that 0s and 3 have only 1s and 2s as neighbours and vice versa. that halves the amount of work done on each neighbour expansion. furthermore for half of the neighbours the indices are the same for a cell and its neighbour when you go from black to white or vice versa. this eliminates half the bit shifts
 emh: 0s and 3s are white and 1s and 2s are black. just like a chess board
 wlesavo: one could get a phd on this :slight_smile:
 emh: hehe
 Zpooks: What exactly does this solve, emh? As a genuine question, i don't get it
 wlesavo: bremh first search
 Zpooks: Huh, thats pretty cool
 Illedan: Nice emh
 heesu77: hello
 emh: thx Illedan
 Insta-x: is this BFS for the contest?
 Insta-x: or it is for other problem?
 emh: it can be used for contest although it is probably overkill
 emh: premature optimization hehe
 Insta-x: so you create this for other problems?
 Insta-x: but 1 mil BFS in 50 ms, thats so fast, good job
 emh: thanks&#160;:) I created it for contest but was thinking it can be used for smash the code maybe also
 emh: not sure about that though
 struct: and its a big distnace bfs
 struct: the origin is always 7 7 emh?
 Insta-x: 1 mil BFS, if i have that power, i still dont know what im going to do with it in this contest :joy:
 Insta-x: smash contest?
 Insta-x: is there any description of the contest?
 struct: smash the code is a multi
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/smash-the-code</a>
 Insta-x: oo, ok thx
 Insta-x: i thought smash the code is the name for the next contest
 darkhorse64: emh, what you describe is a kind of parallel BFS where you compute all neighbours in a given direction. How do you handle the fact that search stops at different times&#160;?
 emh: struct I only tried with origin 7 7 but should work for any, just that you need to know if it starts on black or white. and if multiple starts all must be same color
 emh: darkhorse64 I just check when there is no difference between previous cells and expanded
 Insta-x: if c++ could do 1 mil in 50 ms, how many python could do in 50 ms? i just want to know how slow python is compared to c++
 struct: hard to tell Insta-x
 struct: I would say less than 100k
 Insta-x: about 10-20 times slower?
 darkhorse64: I am to busy debugging my tracker to give it a serious thought. Let's hope you'll share your secret weapon in a playground. Otherwise, we know it can be done ...
 darkhorse64: *too*
 struct: probably 20x Insta-x
 struct: but hard to tell
 struct: also C++ doesnt run with release flags on
 struct: So it is even faster
 Insta-x: flags?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html</a>
 Insta-x: ok thx
 struct: On release -O3 is enabled
 Bastett: This is weird. I seem to be timing out... I put a timer across some code and am losinng 88ms just reading the input from stdin
 SmokingJoe: does anyone here can help me out with merging *cs files to on single&#160;?
 SmokingJoe: one *
 Illedan: SmokingJoe<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger">https://github.com/Illedan/CG-sharpmerger</a>
 SmokingJoe: great, exactly what i was looking for &lt;3 
 dbdr: Bastett you need to start your timer after the (first) input
 dbdr: we need a FAQ on the wiki&#160;:)
 JBM: if only we had a wiki
 dbdr: :P
 JBM: also why does thor keep going E
 Illedan: Thor?
 dbdr: Illedan it's reserved to levels 40+
 Illedan:&#160;?
 dbdr: that's why you don't know what Thor is
 Illedan: ^^
 JBM: but mayby you do know why my pod keeps circling the checkpoint instead of finishing first
 dbdr: did you change leagues recently?
 dbdr: wait...
 dbdr: never mind
 JBM: lol
 dbdr: JBM, it looks as if your goal was to be above dwarfie&#160;;)
 JBM: which multi?
 elderlybeginner: Is sonar useful in the contest?
 JBM: if you want it to be
 JBM: which generalizes to "yes" after two rounds of noticing you have an opponent to whom the same rules apply
 pb4: sonar&#160;: depends who you ask...
 struct: if it costed less
 struct: maybe
 pb4: Look at kovi&#160;: doesn't use it. Look at siman&#160;: uses it all the time. Look at Nagrarok&#160;: doesn't use it. Look at me&#160;: use it a lot
 pb4: Does it cost that much&#160;?
 pb4: For less than the cost of silence you largely mitigate a silence
 cocoche007: Hi all! When I want to submit my subscription to OOC&#160;: ""(#-1)&#160;: "internal error"." "
 cocoche007: Any idea?
 emh: hmm.. getting from 1-1.35 mill. so varies by 35%. I wonder why. is server park heterogeneous?
 struct: not always same machine
 Quidome: Can you switch from AI when playing your code?
 Quidome: In Silver you get the default AI which is not so usefull&#160;:)
 yfprojects: There is  delete button
 Quidome: I see that now, but what happens, can I add another one?
 Quidome: The Bronze Boss would be OK
 dbdr: pb4 sonar can only cut positions in 2 (yes or no), so it's far from mitigating silence, isn't it?
 dbdr: Quickdome: yes, click on it to add someone. you be the bronze boss, or another player
 dbdr: *could be
 Quidome: O, wow, that is really nice. Thnxs!
 pb4: dbdr&#160;: silence is already self-mitigating after a few moves
 pb4: Though I do agree with your argument&#160;:)
 pb4: emh&#160;:   // system("cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"model name\" | head -1 &gt;&amp;2");
 pb4: at the beginning of main
 struct: seems like that there are at least 3#
 emh: found Haswell 2.2GHz and 2.4GHz
 struct: model name	: Intel Core Processor (Haswell, no TSX)cpu MHz		: 2992.968
 emh: ah there found that one as well
 emh: the 2.4 GHz one is the one that gives 1.3 mill. the other give 1 mill
 struct: how much does the 3 give?
 emh: 1 mill strangely
 emh: so the 2.4 is faster than the 3.0
 emh: 200g of chocolate down. now for some black tea. maybe I should do something useful soon instead of bit fiddling hehe
 reCurse: It's not
 reCurse: Each type has its own variance
 reCurse: I'm assuming depending on VM server load maybe
 reCurse: But from my testing the 3.0 ghz is always the fastest one
 reCurse: incl. regular and AVX code
 AntiSquid: are you joining the contest reCurse&#160;?
 JBM: sure he is
 JBM: oops too soon
 reCurse: I'm roleplaying this contest
 reCurse: You'll have to figure this out
 JBM: i got the easy position: can't be contradicted
 reCurse:&#160;?
 JBM: either you show your AI at contest end -5s
 JBM: or you don't because you haven't convinced yourself it scored top 3
 reCurse: So your position is "either you do or either you don't" :clap:
 JBM: my position is: you're working on it
 AntiSquid: lol
 JBM: so, in a word, yes
 eulerscheZahl: my position is that reCurse isn't playing the contest
 reCurse: So you can be contradicted
 JBM: that's a braver one
 eulerscheZahl: i will stick to it until he submits to prove me wrong
 AntiSquid: roleplaying = alt, that's how i understood it
 reCurse: No
 JBM: yeah but i don't know his alt
 reCurse: Roleplaying as in I'm taking the role of a sub during this contest
 Astrobytes: (aka hiding)
 reCurse: You know I'm here but you don't know what I'm doing
 AntiSquid: fascinating 
 reCurse: I know right
 Astrobytes: :D
 JBM: well, *I* know XD
 JBM: according to my position on the subject
 reCurse: Based on completely arbitrary stuff
 reCurse: You think you know me :P
 JBM: and you haven't proved me wrong yet
 reCurse: Why would I?
 JBM: so... maybe i do
 reCurse: I made it clear I have zero intention of saying what I do
 reCurse: Frankly because it's a bit annoying to have this pressure
 JBM: yup, I read you the first time
 JBM: what pressure?
 JBM: from your POV, you're only 50% playing
 reCurse: I'm just speaking from experience
 JBM: oh
 AntiSquid: SILENCE N 0
 reCurse: ^ This guy gets it
 JBM: i thought we established S was the way to not go
 reCurse: Arguing about the direction of a zero vector?
 reCurse: Sounds like my cup of tea
 JBM: well that's what the stream chat concluded anyway
 reCurse: Oh I missed your stream
 JBM: it's on youtube if *really* you're into that
 JBM: there's some canadian guy making overpraising comments there, it feels really uncanny
 AntiSquid: someone was doing a bot with some probabilities and trying to beat wood2 with that over more than 1 stream, he was still stuck last i checked
 reCurse: ouch
 JBM: uh-oh
 JBM: that was my evolution plan
 dbdr: JBM, I at least understood the irrefutability of your position&#160;:)
 JBM: that's nice of you dbdr
 JBM: but I think they all did&#160;;)
 dbdr: reCurse did not seem to
 JBM: rp
 dbdr: maybe he's pretending :D
 JBM: (or sincere annoyance, i dunno)
 reCurse:&#160;? I agree that "Either you do or you don't" is irrefutable
 JBM: but irrefutability is the name od *this* ga;e
 dbdr: no, his position is that you do work on it
 dbdr: and you can't prove that you don't
 reCurse: Oh I see
 dbdr: well, I guess a 24/7 stream could&#160;:)
 JBM: edTv
 reCurse: I thought there was more substance to it
 reCurse: Oh well
 reCurse: Boring
 eulerscheZahl: and today: errichto stream
 JBM: oh, that one has potential ^^
 eulerscheZahl: we could watch so many stream that we don't have time to compete ourselves anymore
 eulerscheZahl: watched him a bit at xmas rush, was disappointed
 eulerscheZahl: he explains everything in detail and didn't make much progress
 JBM: oh
 JBM: ok i'
 eulerscheZahl: also didn't go for the sim-based approach, while it was obvious to do so for xmas rush
 JBM: 'll wait for the feedback then
 Astrobytes: Think he did CalM too
 JBM: i did neither contest nor multi on XR
 eulerscheZahl: maybe, didn't watch
 JBM: no idea what it's about
 eulerscheZahl: do you know "Das verrückte Labyrinth"?
 eulerscheZahl: German board game
 JBM: oh
 JBM: i *have* it
 eulerscheZahl: then you know the contest
 JBM: that's the one
 JBM: ok i did know the contest
 JBM: didn't associate it with "XR"
 eulerscheZahl: a little modified for parallel movements, but still heavily based on the board game
 dbdr: das verrücXte LabyRinth
 dbdr: ezpz
 JBM: the board game was all about getting the last one
 JBM: nothing else really mattered
 JBM: so... huge minmax?
 eulerscheZahl: in the contest each player had 12 tasks to complete
 eulerscheZahl: minimax is hard with parallel movement
 JBM: ah, the extended version :D
 eulerscheZahl: and high branching, as you can push and move to other cells
 eulerscheZahl: i went for some kind of nash equilibrium to predict and counter the opponent, minimax was too pessimistic
 JBM: and for OOC?
 eulerscheZahl: like: if i do A and opponent does B, i loseif I do C and he does D, i lose tooso I do E, that doesn't block B or D
 Bastett: Boom. Bronze league :D
 eulerscheZahl: OOC seems a bad fit for minimax too
 JBM: gg
 eulerscheZahl: congrats
 tempux: i have like 1000 lines of code in python but I think I should migrate to C++. I can't go very deep, too many timeouts
 Bastett: is it hubris to resubmit the same bot and hope for the best?
 JBM: not on cg
 eulerscheZahl: too many uncertainties, you don't even know the torpedo cooldown of your opponent
 JBM: you can bound it
 JBM: but yeah, there's a risk of it being pessimistic
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl isn't Nash equil when the stable strategy is probabilistic?
 AntiSquid: any idea what time errichto's stream is?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, both players agree on an action that won't harm any of them too much
 JBM: there's a counter on his twitch
 JBM: I recall 1800, but not so sure
 AntiSquid: oh
 JBM: oh wait
 dbdr: no, I mean you do A with p=04 and B with p=0.6
 JBM: that's like pretty soon
 AntiSquid: 15 mins from now
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/errichto2/live">https://www.youtube.com/errichto2/live</a>
 JBM: well, go check the homepage
 dbdr: that's the game theoretic solution. not sure if you can base a bot on that
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, in 15min
 eulerscheZahl: it helped me to predict and counter where minimax failed
 eulerscheZahl: if the opponent has 2 possible ways to get the item and both have a counter that might work depending on the opponent action, i tried to prevent it at least
 eulerscheZahl: my minimax was like "he will get the item anyways, i'll do something else"
 eulerscheZahl: so i still can't be sure that i will block the opponent but at least increase my chances
 AntiSquid: gave up on XR for now, was at #2 a few times lol just needed a push
 dbdr: yeah. but then you should chose randomly which one you block
 eulerscheZahl: #2 in gold?
 AntiSquid: yes
 dbdr: otherwise he could predict it, at least theoretically
 dbdr: and do the other move
 Csipcsirip: I'm trying some kind of mcts. after a round the next player has a virtual command to choose of his possible states. if it would work it'd very cool
 eulerscheZahl: i implemented it as some kind of markov chain, giving probabilities for each possible opponent action
 eulerscheZahl: so, back to my braindead bot of the current contest

 Csipcsirip: nice "kill"
 eulerscheZahl: i should debug that one
 eulerscheZahl: i killed one of the players at least

 tempux: silence w 5&#160;:))
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl is there a known bug about taking damage when you shoot and move into the damage zone later?
 eulerscheZahl: nothere was a week ago but fixed
 eulerscheZahl: any new bug?
 dbdr: ok. Stilgart seems to think it still happens, but no replay yet
 kovi: cheat code
 dbdr: to damage yourself? :D
 kovi: silence w 5
 dbdr: -&gt; mess up with opponent's predictions
 dbdr: could be worth one life&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: submit time
 AntiSquid: you surface, but they get correct prediction afaik 
 AntiSquid: i mean correct command
 kovi: invalid command is not shown
 eulerscheZahl: my bugfix wins the game at frame 137 for the replay above already
 AntiSquid: all you need to do is type here your current rank every 5% of your submit
 reCurse: Ah yes, the cegprakesh technique
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, the progress doesn't update often enough anymore
 eulerscheZahl: CG made the ranking update laggy
 reCurse: Yeah what's up with that
 AntiSquid: stream started - movie time
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not in a mood for coding anyways, so why not...
 eulerscheZahl: he's at 52% profile completion, I have 80 :trophy:
 icecream17: oh sorry everyone, silence is not teleport
 AntiSquid: he mnetioned sudoku &gt; obv a sudoku algo will win this game then! :D
 izik1: Huh, I got into bronze over night
 izik1: neat
 MadKnight: gj izik1
 MadKnight: izipizik
 izik1: \o MadKnight
 MadKnight: how's your izipizi legend&#160;?
 izik1:&#160;? csb?
 izik1: Haven't been around&#160;:/ Probably needs some love
 MadKnight: no i mean your contest
 izik1: oh
 AntiSquid: there's no legend yet madao
 MadKnight: but it will be
 AntiSquid: where's your bot?
 izik1: It sucks honestly, I intentionally didn't implement a lot of stuff to see if I could get to bronze without silence/mines/etc
 izik1: well, mines didn't exist :v
 izik1: So, all I have is torps a good enemy tracker and really bad movement
 AntiSquid: lol he deleted the statement
 eulerscheZahl: no, just the bot outputsand spawned on an island without realizing
 MadKnight: lol u could spawn on an island&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, but it will make you lose
 izik1: I'm really good at not spawning on islands, I'm really bad at not spawning in tiny corners
 AntiSquid: madao why you don't do contests anymore?
 MadKnight: not this one u mean?
 MadKnight: i kind of didn't like this game
 wlesavo: always exited about new ways to kill yourself
 AntiSquid: generally
 eulerscheZahl: what was your last contest MadKnight? xmas rush?
 AntiSquid: you always submit some bronze /. silver bot
 eulerscheZahl: i don't count 500-ish ranks as playing
 AntiSquid: bits!! :o
 eulerscheZahl: catch-it-all headercommon among codeforces users
 icecream17: the only way to improve my bot is to rewrite whole sections of code
 AntiSquid: JUST DO IT!
 Uljahn: just do your TODO
 elderlybeginner: what's your strategy for locating opponent in the contest?
 ZarthaxX: random shooting
 blasterpoard: bruteforce
 ZarthaxX: until you hit him
 ZarthaxX: :bird:
 wlesavo: banch of heuristics
 elderlybeginner: random doesn't let me get out of wood1
 ZarthaxX: was kidding
 wlesavo: random with tracking
 ZarthaxX: bruteforce it
 AntiSquid: silence until they time out, then you find out where they were
 elderlybeginner: I didin't&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: start with all possible locations for enemy elderlybeginner
 ZarthaxX: and then when he does an aciton, do that aciton for all his possible locations
 ZarthaxX: eventually you will discard a lot and you will have some idea of where he can be
 wlesavo: yeah, silence N 0 is a way to bronze
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid lol
 elderlybeginner: ZarthaxX, thats a lot of coordinates to copy each time opponent moves
 wlesavo: enemy elderlybeginner
 blasterpoard: elderlybeginner it might be somewhat challenging in python
 AntiSquid: 'infidel' elderlybeginner
 ZarthaxX: elderlybeginner initially 225 is the cap until he starts doing silence , but well if you are in python for example it's bad
 AntiSquid: there's a python on #6, no excuses&#160;!
 AntiSquid: get #7
 wlesavo: got my fair 40% against kovi
 wlesavo: but im up to something
 elderlybeginner: do you suggest tracking every movement of opponent and excluding positions due to island collision and so on?
 blasterpoard: exactly
 elderlybeginner: that's a bit of comutation, and then there is a silence
 elderlybeginner: computation
 Uljahn: you can ignore silence in wood1
 elderlybeginner: calculating only the last turn is probably not enough, to cut possibilities fast enough
 elderlybeginner: you have to calculate whole track of an opponent starting from the first round, right?
 wlesavo: that would help, but even moderate tracking without considering whole path is ok 
 elderlybeginner: maybe drawing a path of an opponent and then bitwise xor or and on map
 Uljahn: yep, in python you can easily do a rolling window with numpy
 elderlybeginner: did you see my nick? not that level yet&#160;:)
 wlesavo: &gt;xor on mapthat similar to what im doing
 Uljahn: i'm using bitwise and for path checks
 Counterbalance: you don't need the path; just update the possible locations each turn, like this:
 Counterbalance: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f33f4c9-3971-4b57-9639-624918c8a3a5">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f33f4c9-3971-4b57-9639-624918c8a3a5</a>
 icecream17: i did possible locations but I can't think of any other way to improve tracking
 eulerscheZahl: do you handle explosions in your tracking?
 eulerscheZahl: you shoot somewhere and hit the opponent =&gt; opponent in explosion
 eulerscheZahl: or not there if you don't hit
 icecream17: torpedo, silence, and mine on both sides
 eulerscheZahl: then you are done tracking i guess
 icecream17: well, not opponent mine, but that's..... also hard
 elderlybeginner: Counterbalance, yep, I was thinking about exact the same solution and also about drawing path and xor. I see there is no shortcuts and there is no easy way
 icecream17: and no, i'm not done, other people show "27" and mine shows "29 possible"....
 eulerscheZahl: replay?
 Counterbalance: once you narrow it down to 1 possible location, you can backtrack previous turns to find the path so you know which cells the opponent has visited, but that's a later optimisation
 Counterbalance: dinnertime, bbl
 icecream17: i'm in the middle of rewriting my code, so i can't
 eulerscheZahl: do you keep the full path or only the current cell icecream17?
 wlesavo: icecream17 thats barely meaningful
 wlesavo: most like your bottleneck womewhere else
 wlesavo: damn my typing is bad
 icecream17: [rightNow, [where opponent silenced], 'string of NSEW opponent did']
 icecream17: instead of [possible starting position]
 icecream17: and "main string for all position of NSEW"
 icecream17: wlesavo i need ideas
 eulerscheZahl: the storage as a string alone is something most of us probably do differently
 eulerscheZahl: do you check that the opponent doesn't cut the own path?
 icecream17: Only in silence, otherwise I assume the opponent doesn't do it because otherwise "Lives -1"
 icecream17: But wait....
 eulerscheZahl: there is some move history you don't completely know because of silence
 eulerscheZahl: but the movements disallow some positions as it would result in a cycle
 wlesavo: icecream17 selftracking, minimization of information given by your actions, mine tracking
 icecream17: If silence I add the appropiate amount of N,S,E,orW to a specific possibleOpp
 icecream17: wlesavo, I take 28ms so self tracking may be hard
 icecream17: Back then I used to have many for loops, but now I combined them into one
 izik1: what language?
 icecream17: js
 izik1: hmm
 wlesavo: icecream17 you possibly need to prune better, 28 seems a lot
 izik1: I'm still at 0 in debug mode rust .-.
 izik1: Which clearly means that I'm not using information
 izik1: But yeah, 28 seems like a lot
 icecream17: Turn=0 -&gt; 1ms, Turn = 1-&gt; 113ms 5 for loops... many hoisted functions and 18 variables, so not that much considering
 izik1: speaking of major refactors, I'm going to have to do that with paths probably
 izik1: Hmm, 18 variables doesn't sound like that many, unless you're like... Changing all of them in a tight loop?
 icecream17: Rest of turns = 1 for loop, other smaller for loops, functions "within() [torpedoing]", "trig() [mine and trigger]", "handleOpponent()", and quite a few calls to "avail()". And no....
 icecream17: variables are ...inputs, time, width, height, myId, board, path, torpedoed, exploded, prevOppLives, turn, sameDir[], noShoot, mines[], water[], possCharges[], type[], Iserror[], available[], land[], nextboard[], possibleOpp[], availOpp[] in turn 0.
 izik1: Iserror?
 icecream17: And other variables, gone[], first[], x, y, myLife,oppLife, tC sC mC, opponentOrders, otherm, random, m, evil, t, w, charge.
 icecream17: Iserror = "Ugh, the random bug where 0 possibleOpp positions....."
 izik1: That's a pretty bad bug
 izik1: I get it too sometimes
 icecream17: It's pretty helpful, discovered many more bugs with that.
 k4ng0u: better be pessimistic than have 0 poss opp position :P I guess this happens when he inflicts damage to himself or you triggered a mine and a torpedo at teh same turn?
 icecream17: The array = [false, turn]
 izik1: It happens if you don't track them correctly, before I implemented stuff to do with silence, I'd get that bug if they silenced (because it just didn't change any state in my tracker)
 icecream17: k4ng0u, no I don't consider the position if two things happen....
 izik1: them self torping and you torping can cause it
 icecream17: Maybe that's why my tracking is worse than others
 izik1: or really any other way of confusing your tracker
 k4ng0u: what is land?
 icecream17: No, inside the handleOpponent() there's more variables move, surface, torped, ohno, order, theybomb, and previously mentioned torpedoed and exploded, which handle all cases
 icecream17: land = spaces tht are land
 icecream17: ohno = silence, torped = opponent, torpedo = you, theybomb and exploded = they, you
 icecream17: *torpedo -&gt; torpedoed
 k4ng0u: what i like to do with discrete games like this is to compute for each cells all their neighbouring accessible cells in the first turn. Then you only have to loop on those possible cells during the rest of the game instead of checking each 4 possibilities each time
 izik1: Honestly, checking "any neighbor" is just 3 array accesses
 izik1: for me
 izik1: and some bitshifts
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d77ed36-f685-48f9-b711-7cb7cdb32200">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7d77ed36-f685-48f9-b711-7cb7cdb32200</a>
 icecream17: Someone takes the total damage for each square and checks like that. That seems much faster and better. Checking any neighbor is done by logic. Checking if neighbor=water is done by avail(x, y)
 icecream17: k4ng0u, I coded that but I commented it out because I felt too lazy to change my code...
 k4ng0u: icecream17 no pain no gain :p
 izik1: The pain I'm about to go through... _sighs_
 icecream17: I wish there was more time
 izik1: more than 50 ms?
 icecream17: more than 19D 14H
 izik1: oh
 izik1: I mean, I started 10 days late and I don't really feel pressed for time yet
 icecream17: I always procrastinate in school so I divide the number of days by 10.
 izik1: I'm pretty sure one of your days is around the same value as mine, and I only divide the number of days by 2 :v
 icecream17: Huh. I wonder what :v would look lie in real life
 jrke: which is the shortest launguage
 icecream17: Befunge?
 icecream17: Or maybe that language with colors and pixels...
 icecream17: what's that called?
 Raptor0816: Has anyone completed Shadows of the Knight?
 ZarthaxX: y
 Raptor0816: I am failing on the last test case lol
 Raptor0816: Trying to figure out if there is anything different or tricky about it
 dbdr: kovi, wow, looks like you broke away above the rest
 Beerus: how can you save your code except from play button
 icecream17: ctrl+enter lol. save milliseconds
 kovi: we need to wait for resubmit at least
 kovi: i had some lucky seq each day
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 kovi: oh, nice submit btw dbdr!
 dbdr: thanks
 dbdr: back in top 3&#160;:)
 dbdr: aaaaand, it's gone
 wlesavo: :slight_smile:
 kovi: sorry
 dbdr: np&#160;:)
 icecream17: Okay, I rewrote my code but there's a lot of bugs
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 how to catch bugs&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i got it to work for me
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 just get yourself an Uljahn
 Automaton2000: i don't even try to get as close as possible to get a t-shirt

 eulerscheZahl: i like your southpark reference dbdr
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 icecream17: you know what, i give up, i'm not path tracing
 eulerscheZahl: so, kovi destroying us again?
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 kovi: 19 days to go...
 kovi: it might be close to a legend submit though
 eulerscheZahl: in legend already
 eulerscheZahl: in the last marathon legend was about 50 players on the start
 eulerscheZahl: longer contest -&gt; lower ranked boss
 dbdr: what?
 dbdr: boss was about #15 at opening in locam
 eulerscheZahl: i'm pretty sure it was lower
 dbdr: how many at the end?
 yfprojects: Automaton2000 I would compete just for prices too!
 Automaton2000: yeah that's what i wanted to ask that
 eulerscheZahl: with the reasoning of already having pretty advanced bots
 dbdr: with one week to improve, that would be a huge legend at the end...
 eulerscheZahl: 88 in legend
 eulerscheZahl: and it's reasonable to take a lower ranked boss on a marathon
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: are you use only 40 made it to legend after opening?
 eulerscheZahl: can you rephrase that?
 dbdr: I'm surprised it was 50 at opening and 88 one week later
 AntiSquid: for local play of the game is there a gamerunner.stop()&#160;? i don't know how to run multiple batches Q_Q
 dbdr: 10 days even, 2 week-ends
 eulerscheZahl: at some point a player won't get better, skill cap for that specific person reached
 dbdr: true
 dbdr: they just have more time for spam submits&#160;;)
 kovi: and push others into legend&#160;:)
 dbdr: only get you a certain way
 eulerscheZahl: the league size also depends on the type of game
 eulerscheZahl: heuristic contests have larger legend leagues than sim based, when you take a boss around #15 in both cases
 eulerscheZahl: mean max being the extreme for sim based
 dbdr: ╰─➤  grep TODO **/*.rs|wc -l18
 dbdr: 18 TODOs
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to do them though
 eulerscheZahl: get some rest
 eulerscheZahl: rest &gt; rust
 dbdr: that's just in code, I have a separate list too
 dbdr: :D
 kovi: my todo list is at the start/end of code
 kovi: (besides the incode ones)
 Illedan: All my code is Todo :P
 dbdr: often I write code, and this I can make it better later, or need to check something but don't want to interrupt
 dbdr: in that case the TODO is at that point in code
 dbdr:  //TODO optimize winning chances

 eulerscheZahl: Stilgart you solved it :onice!
 ZarthaxX: what?
 eulerscheZahl: click the replay above ZarthaxX
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: well, only 33%
 eulerscheZahl: a good start
 Stilgart: I agree
 wlesavo: also wanted to do the spaze maze, but contest happened
 ZarthaxX: holy f
 Stilgart: now is the time to find a good heuristic for my A*
 wlesavo: litteraly was next on my list :slight_smile:
 PandarinDev: go
 icecream17: what do I do against silence spam hmmm.....
 eulerscheZahl: a killing torpedo
 eulerscheZahl: works against any type of submarine if placed well
 Nagatwin: Sounds like your STB strat
 Nagatwin: STC*
 eulerscheZahl: STC has no torpedoes&#160;:(
 Nagatwin: like "bury him under skulls"

 dbdr:  kovi, errichto analyzed our game live on twitchyou won of course&#160;:)
 kovi: yeah, i saw&#160;:)
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: you did get lucky right?
 dbdr: at least to get that critical hit
 kovi: yeah, but there were many mines
 dbdr: so?
 dbdr: I mean you were ahead, no question
 dbdr: lol my sub: matches 1 to 16: looking good!17 to 21: wait...
 Errichto: it seems that kovi knew exactly where red is ;p
 wlesavo: dbdred

 wlesavo: to dbdreckt everybody
 eulerscheZahl: who is red? dbdred!

 eulerscheZahl: on the ground of the ocean
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl where would you place your current bot at the end of marathon
 eulerscheZahl: 50-60
 eulerscheZahl: hard to tell, these long contests are rare
 dbdr: that high?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that high
 eulerscheZahl: i'm high af
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: good for you
 wlesavo: hm, that is really kinda high
 eulerscheZahl: usually a contest ends after 10 days
 dbdr: we can actually try in on the last sunday
 eulerscheZahl: so we don't have much experience
 dbdr: submit some old bots

 dbdr: Stilgart you needed a contest to start working on it?
 dbdr: the power of procrastination&#160;;)
 dbdr: what next, bender 4 next week?
 Stilgart: nope, i needed an idea
 Stilgart: it was not as good as expected but at least I solved it at 40% now
 Stilgart: 20 more submits to go :D
 dbdr: is that submit spam?
 Stilgart: ThomasNicoullaud showed me the way
 Stilgart: seriously... 43%&#160;?!
 BenjaminUrquhart: this is why I never got around to validating space jam
 BenjaminUrquhart: oh it's space maze
 BenjaminUrquhart: I swear it was space jam at some point
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok time to finally do new ocean strat
 Stilgart: there were two puzzles at some point
 BenjaminUrquhart: hm
 Tunga: I just joined the Ocean of Code and this is thrilling for me

 MSmits: I wonder if it may shift by 32 bit in a 32 bit system or something
 pb4: yes
 MSmits: 64 bit system i mean
 MSmits: so it never shifts?
 MSmits: I wanted to xor a 32 bit array together to get a hash, I figured if i cast it to 64 bit first, I dont have to xor so much and can use a 64 bit hash key
 emh: MSmits can also use unions. or memcpy (usually optimized out).
 emh: for small values I mean
 MSmits: yeah  i used those before
 MSmits: unions are a bit inconvenient to use imho... but I could be using them wrong
 MSmits: also if my 32 bit array has 15 elements, it doesnt fit perfectly in a 64 bit array
 MSmits: so union is a bit annoying there
 icecream17: Weird, for some reason the bottom right corner disappears from the ocean.....
 MSmits: finally, proof the earth is flat!!!
 icecream17:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 MSmits: icecream17 that's the place where the Earth ends...
 Counterbalance: y = 0&#160;; y &lt; HEIGHT - 1; y ++&#160;?
 icecream17: at space?
 Counterbalance: Nah the earth doesn't end. It just goes round and round.
 MSmits: like the wheels
 icecream17: Counterbalance, it happened at move 43
 MSmits: on the :bus:
 Astrobytes: go round and round
 Asterixk: you broke the ocean?
 Astrobytes: allll daaaay loooong
 MSmits: Astrobytes getting into it now
 icecream17: it dissappeared 2 moves after the opponent lost a life, which is the best i got and probably misleading
 struct: another portuguesse
 struct: Im 1st on OOC from portugal
 struct: im the only one though
 Asterixk: yoo struct
 struct: hi
 Astrobytes: Hell yeah MSmits, I used to make up loads of verses for that for my nephews :D
 Asterixk: lol gz
 struct: Im not really playing it yet though 
 Counterbalance: you're last in your country, struct?
 struct: yes&#160;:(
 MSmits: cool Astrobytes
 Asterixk: so you'r the one who took my 1st place in contests fro portugal
 Counterbalance: i'm tempted to un-nerf my bot to get to silver but I'm so close...
 struct: And Im not very active on contests
 struct: I'm a bit of a slow coder
 Asterixk: me too lazy af. was more active during college.
 Astrobytes: *I'm a bit of an account deleter
 Astrobytes: :P
 MSmits: why is your bot nerfed Counterbalance?

 MSmits: you trying to give other players a chance?
 Astrobytes: Hiding MSmits :D
 struct: Im not sure about it, the game type just isnt for me
 Counterbalance: just checking if the basics are working good before adding more commands
 MSmits: Csipcsirip lol... just floodfill your start locations :P
 MSmits: Counterbalance I am still doing that&#160;:)
 Csipcsirip: idk what happened here :p 
 MSmits: rank 148 silver now... not using any mines still
 Counterbalance: wow what a map
 struct: lol
 icecream17: Everyone does the corners or the middle, but doing the sides are just as effective
 MSmits: as a start location? I think most do random
 icecream17: really?
 Counterbalance: i do random with a fixed seed
 Counterbalance: so it's always the same position
 icecream17: that game was amazing
 MSmits: me too Counterbalance
 icecream17: var variable ..later... "Error: undefined"
 struct: There might be better options than random
 icecream17: i wonder... expert rules is just the source code. is there anything important? hmm
 struct: What do you mean?
 struct: Ah I see what you mean now
 struct: Is just the referee, so the rules in code
 icecream17: oh ok
 Counterbalance: 0.4 under boss at 2.. fixed horrible bugs.. resubmit probably wont come close to that, as usual
 TheAtomicBreakfastInSpace_7c6f: k
 TheAtomicBreakfastInSpace_7c6f: :persevere
 TheAtomicBreakfastInSpace_7c6f: :grimacing:
 Counterbalance: :sweat_smile:
 D1WhoWins: yeh
 Counterbalance: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::logic_error'
 D1WhoWins: :rage:
 Counterbalance: :scream:

 MostComplicatedUsername: Nixerrr forgetting to reset trail after surfacing?
 ToshiTuringMachine: i have a question. first turn 1 sec only to output the starting position?
 MostComplicatedUsername: Yes
 MostComplicatedUsername: And the move
 MostComplicatedUsername: So 2 output lines first turn
 ToshiTuringMachine: and move? i don't get it
 ToshiTuringMachine: first player 1 choses position... second player 2 .. after player 1 has 50 ms to move
 ToshiTuringMachine: however it times out in dart after first 700ms so I have no clue
 D1WhoWins: nextCheckpointAngle and nextCheckpointDist both show up as nil in the error stream when I use them.
 ToshiTuringMachine: in what league are you TheAtomicBreakfastInSpace_7c6f
 D1WhoWins: I'm in Wood 2 League, it just told me I can use them
 ToshiTuringMachine: ah yes i think i remember
 ToshiTuringMachine: sometimes it will output nil, just ignore it
 D1WhoWins: k thx
 ToshiTuringMachine: next turn it will be ok
 MostComplicatedUsername: ToshiTuringMachine Turn1: Player 1 choose starting positions AND movePlayer 2 chooses starting position and move
 ToshiTuringMachine: oh now i see
 ToshiTuringMachine: thank you

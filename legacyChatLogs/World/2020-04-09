 MJSS: When the contests end, are the games added to the normal compete list?
 aCat: yes
 thibpat: hi :wave: I'm live again for more Ocean Of Code! I'll try to focus on pathfinding today <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/thibpat">https://www.twitch.tv/thibpat</a>
 Nagatwin: what happened kovi&#160;? :o
 kovi: fine-untuning - or less lucky rolls
 Nagatwin: Haha
 Nagatwin: Yeah did
 Nagatwin: did that yesterday
 Nagatwin: you are ruining my rank I have ~0% wr against you
 Nagatwin: chunknorris you should submit some more :D
 Nagatwin: Sounds like we have different possibilites counters
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447072978">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447072978</a>
 Nagatwin: at least for paths kovi
 Nagatwin: might be caused because I remove duplicate paths
 kovi: could be
 Nagatwin: aren't you&#160;?
 kovi: nope
 Nagatwin: sounds liek you are generating tons of them compared to others ais
 kovi: thx for letting me knowearly on i had problems with n^2 merging of them. i will look into it again
 Nagatwin: you can merge linearly
 Nagatwin:&#160;;)
 chucknorris: I'm trying my best Naga:p submit nr 914:
 kovi: wow, twice as mine
 chucknorris: yeah I got a little bit obsessed with that submit button
 chucknorris: I'ts hard to tell the effect of my latest "critical" bugfix when the leaderboard is so random 
 wlesavo: i hope in legend it would be more stable
 AntiSquid: it won't be wlesavo
 AntiSquid: in fact expect 50 at the very least in legend by the end of the contest and expect it to be very random
 AntiSquid: just 1-4 bots at the top might be stable
 AntiSquid: but there's recalc too after the contest, which might, just might fix things
 AntiSquid: but your last position on the ladder still matters when recalc starts
 wlesavo: i see, thx
 wlesavo: there goes my hopes for fine tuning 
 Nerchio: yesterday i was staring at my code for way too long and i couldn't find a mistake and today i found it in 3 minutes...
 Nerchio: life of beginner programmer
 aCat: Don't worry
 aCat: after a few years it is still the same :P
 BlueBull: hello
 BlueBull: what to do about the reverse mode at clash of code
 yfprojects: just do real puzzles
 JBM: reverse it

 AntiSquid: BlueGhost31 what's that about?
 BlueGhost31: Hello AntiSquid
 Nagatwin: That wild tag
 AntiSquid: oh damn, again pinged wrong person, sorry, ignore me BlueGhost31
 Nerchio: can i make the code bigger somehow :p
 BlueGhost31: :wink: ok 
 aCat: OMG, top OOC games looks like extremelly boring chess
 Angola: so true
 aCat: But  strategies are different
 aCat: which is nice
 Nerchio: how many turns games last at the top?
 aCat: 200-3xx it seems
 Nerchio: and what do you guys think is the most powerful move/power?
 pb4: Nerchio&#160;: as in if I had only one which would it be&#160;?
 Nerchio: yea 1 or 2 
 struct: Mine Silence?
 wlesavo: move is the most powerful
 pb4: checknorris&#160;: for real 914 submits&#160;?!
 pb4: chucknorris
 Nerchio: i am in silver and at the moment mines are the biggest pain they limit the movement so much
 wlesavo: chessnorris
 aCat: It's - mine your part of the board and surface to never got to the nemy half :P
 chucknorris: *923
 wlesavo: mine more than half and you win
 Nerchio: if you shoot a mine does it explode?
 struct: no
 Nerchio: I feel like if top level is about doing mines on your side of the map you should be able to clear them somehow :p
 wlesavo: i think in the original capitan sonar this is the case, some way to balance the mines, although i like the way we have it even more
 Nerchio: i need to watch some top games to make a decision :p
 Nerchio: how did you guys tackle line of sight?
 KTU_lyceum: i dont understand error free(): invalid pointer, maybe anyone knows?
 RoboStac: it means you called free on an address that isn't allocated (often means you are freeing a null or  freeing one address twice)
 KTU_lyceum: but i dont use free
 AntiSquid: add a  if(pointerVariable&#160;!= NULL) before that piece of code see what happens 
 RoboStac: maybe you are calling something that does
 KTU_lyceum: k tnx
 RoboStac: the other thing to check is that anytime you use arrays you don't go out of bounds as this can corrupt memory and cause weird errors 
 KTU_lyceum: yea maybe. I use vector inside vector, maybe i go out of bound. Tnx i think i know where to check&#160;:)
 RoboStac: yeah, that could easily cause it (when vectors go out of scope they'll call free)
 RoboStac: you can try putting #define _GLIBCXX_DEBUG as the first line of your code (has to be before includes) - might give a more useful message
 pb4: ^
 pb4: Won't give you the trace or line where the faulty code is though
 pb4: but it'll tell you there is faulty code
 KTU_lyceum: Great when you can get good advice fast&#160;:)
 WINWINWIN: Hi, I am a programming novice and I want to get started on poker chip race
 WINWINWIN: Can any1 give advice on how to move ahead from wood2 without any complex algorithms?
 AntiSquid: try the contest WINWINWIN <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code">https://www.codingame.com/contests/ocean-of-code</a>it's for everyone and there are streams on youtube / twitch on how to build a bot
 AntiSquid: if you want to use less complex algorithms play a different game WINWINWIN, don't think you can do much in poker chip with just heuristics
 WINWINWIN: ok
 AntiSquid: WINWINWIN this game is ok with just heuristics, no complex algorithms:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/botters-of-the-galaxy</a>
 WINWINWIN: Will start the contest, and botters of the galaxy, thanks AntiSquid
 WINWINWIN: but in poker chip race, I cant even get out of wood2 with just heuristics?
 WINWINWIN: If not, can you reccomend a good site to learn the relevant methods?
 AntiSquid: you could if you do some maths
 AntiSquid: check distance between objects
 WINWINWIN: Currently I move to the largest object just under my size
 WINWINWIN: How would I implement distance?
 AntiSquid: it's a harder game, there are over a thousand people in wood2 for a good reason :D
 WINWINWIN: :D
 AntiSquid: just distance between two points (the center of the balls) and see if the sum of radius if the balls is smaller or equal to their distance then you know they collide 
 Nagatwin: Are you Winning&#160;?
 AntiSquid: you could maybe move them a bit at a time and check collisions
 AntiSquid: honestly play a different game WINWINWIN, not the best to start with
 WINWINWIN: Started with 9 others, got to bronze in all of them
 WINWINWIN: CSB, GitC, CotC and some others
 AntiSquid: then why not take them a bit further?
 AntiSquid: what kind of game do you prefer anyway
 WINWINWIN: Where analysis of graphs and math knowledge is important
 WINWINWIN: Like in CSB where I am attempting modifications in Silver
 AntiSquid: you can get legend in CSB with just maths
 AntiSquid: no complex algo, few if else
 WINWINWIN: K, will try that, after some learning will come back to poker
 WINWINWIN: thanks AntiSquid
 struct: You can always try and write a sim
 struct: There is lots of info on CSB
 AntiSquid: it feels like a long writeup for new starters maybe @struct
 struct: You will need sim for poker if you want to go high
 WINWINWIN: Will look into that struct
 AntiSquid: better if he just fools around with the basics until he feels comfortable&#160;?
 Nagatwin: Stop saying that AntiSquid its not that easy :p
 AntiSquid: what isn't easy?
 WINWINWIN: Easy for him Rank 7!!!
 AntiSquid: what did i call easy anyway?
 WINWINWIN: CSB legend&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: ah it's just math and if else, honestly, just try a bit of tweaking your conditions
 Nagatwin:&#160;:'(
 Nagatwin: Not even gold
 Nagatwin: I really have to spend time on this one but it is not appealing
 AntiSquid: i only played it because back when i first started MadKnight was constantly asking people to play CSB
 Nagatwin: He still does
 Nagatwin: kovi + valgrowth spamming submits are dragging me down super fast
 AntiSquid: the ladder is shuffled a lot
 AntiSquid: i am above few people that i am sure have stronger bots atm
 wlesavo: if euler wont resub he would have an ok chance to become a boss
 kovi: i have lost tracking what help and what is not
 kovi: ranking seriously depend on submit order
 wlesavo: true, i tried to tweek some parameters and then went back to what i had, i guess the time is coming for drastic measures
 Nerchio: where to see your number of submits?
 Astrobytes: Nerchio Click on History, first row of the table
 struct: results history
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/pgh5s2J.png">https://i.imgur.com/pgh5s2J.png</a>

 struct: hi
 struct: I see publish on codingame option
 struct: What is this
 Astrobytes: Where?
 struct: In CvZ
 struct: I can do publish
 struct: I think its a bug
 struct: As long as the submit has 100% I can share it
 struct: publish*

 Nerchio: if the map is too open my tracking multiplies the enemy too much and times out&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Prune your results Nerchio
 Astrobytes: struct, yeah I see it in other optims too. IT's greyed out tho, did you try pressing it?
 struct: If I press it says published
 struct: Also why does the history tab now has outdated?
 struct: Is it due to languages changing version?
 Astrobytes: Could be yeah, sounds about right

 Famout: Ah the joy of being gone too long, racking my brain to remember easy tasks. 
 Famout: Like forgetting constructors don't get any return types at all, not even a void....
 eulerscheZahl: wlesavo 01:33PMif euler wont resub he would have an ok chance to become a boss
 IjustKilledutoo: hello
 IjustKilledutoo: is anybody listening
 Nerchio: hello
 Famout: Partly, brain feeling warm so watching for distractions. 
 tobk: wonder what flavour of pac-man the contest will be. multiple pac-mans, or players control the ghosts? or something entirely different just loosely based on the theme...
 AntiSquid: pacman title
 wlesavo: zipman
 AntiSquid: zetman
 Nerchio: I lose on timeout against a guy that doesn't do anything but move and silence when he can haha
 Ivan-Clark: Pinoy here?
 Nerchio: because he doesn't give out any information except that
 Famout: Still coding my first bit of ship now... not gonna lie that's gonna be its life at first. 
 Famout: To spend as much time underwater and hidden as possible and outlive most other boats.... Then comes coding in tracking and such.
 wlesavo: Nerchio most likely you timeout because you do not prune/merge
 Nerchio: i know i am making clones when they move and i have 1000 of them when they silence or something :D
 Illedan: Hi
 Illedan: Oh, soon 2k players \o/
 wlesavo: hi Illedan, long time no sub?
 chucknorris: any public ooc brutal tester compatible referee&#160;?
 Illedan: yeah wlesavo. Needed a little break
 Illedan: and I'm working on some bigger changes
 Illedan: We had a PR on the real one working with brutal tester afaik, chucknorris
 Illedan: You can check the forum
 Illedan: there is a post about this
 wlesavo: kovi, you prefer crashing over suicide, dont know if its important but still <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447200345">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447200345</a>
 kovi: thx. yeah, if im out of places i crash
 KarlTaal: Hey guys, can someone explain what is the speed vector in coders strike back? What does the x and y value represent in it?
 Illedan: Position transitions happening this current round
 darkhorse64: components of the speed according to x,y axes
 chucknorris: hm Illedan found the pr, but its not working for me. can you show me the forum post about it? cant find it
 KarlTaal: so where how much is added to my current x an y after this round?
 Illedan: Nvm, chucknorris. It was only to run the project locally&#160;:( Did you check the forks made to the repo?
 darkhorse64: I am not sure I understand your question. The referee updates your position
 Illedan: correct KarlTaal
 chucknorris: yes I checkedand found the brutal tester fork. but no info about the usage
 Illedan: Did you use brutal tester earlier?
 chucknorris: yes. it worked. but for this one, it runs the game with default bots
 Illedan: Wierd&#160;:/
 chucknorris: ahh okay it's forking. forgot to checkout the right branck :p 
 chucknorris: but I have to set my timeout to like 35ms not to have timeouts
 WaterDrinker: Is there any way to opt out of shortest code in clash of code?
 informathemusic: Hello World!
 chucknorris: pb4 should we be afraid or it was a lucky roll aigan? :p  
 AntiSquid: no WaterDrinker
 rwilson: WaterDrinker 99% certain there is not.  CodingGame change COC not TERRIBLY long ago...  you used to be able to pick, now it's all in 1
 YannT: I made a brutaltester version of the referee
 YannT: mainly  you just have to add this class into the project and build the JAR
 YannT: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cfce632b-2d6b-496c-827f-beef119bc0f4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cfce632b-2d6b-496c-827f-beef119bc0f4</a>
 chucknorris: thanks, it's already working. except it timeouts more oftan than in cg
 chucknorris: much more often almost every time
 YannT: yes it does, I fixed that too
 YannT: with:
 YannT: gameManager.setTurnMaxTime(200);
 YannT: at the top of Referee.init()
 chucknorris: GameManager - Warning: too many turns and/or too much time allocated to players per turn (30000ms/30000ms)
 eax.qbyte: How to disable this discord thing?
 YannT: chucknorris: weird, it doesn't do that for me
 YannT: maybe your bot stalls or something?
 Nerchio: people in silver started using mines makes me so sad
 Nerchio: my bot would have to be completely reworked to beat it :D
 Nerchio: top silver is like 70% mine use
 semera: Could I somehow save my learning data to file between games?  Or I have to simulate whole environment in my computer?
 Liftyee: nani
 blasterpoard: semera you can download the source code of a game from github; however the problem with ML is usually the character limit
 blasterpoard: (your submitted file can have at most 100k characters, I think)
 semera: thanks! 
 semera: Do you have link, I found several "solutions" but not a simulator/game
 blasterpoard: which game?
 semera: Coders Strike Back

 icecream17: do we have to install JDK and Maven to run it locally?
 blasterpoard: well, there are releases on the github page...
 icecream17: i don't know much about how github works though....
 MadKnight: it works ezpz
 icecream17: how do you download? what is cloneing and branch? what is mdn-- install or something? how do you run something after you download?
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester/releases">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester/releases</a>
 blasterpoard: download the jar
 icecream17: okay i have the jar file....
 icecream17: double click or open doesn't do anything
 blasterpoard: now there's a file that says "read me"
 blasterpoard: read it
 icecream17: where? it's not a folder
 blasterpoard: (I give up)
 icecream17: Type = "Executable Jar File" but "Open" just changes the mouse cursor and then the mouse cursor goes back to normal and nothing has happenned
 Nagatwin: you can't execute a jar file likt that
 icecream17: err.. what do you do
 icecream17: ok i googled it and it says i have to have java runtime environment or something
 icecream17: or use decompression software, idk
 icecream17: oh well i'm downloading ti
 icecream17: "Java Setup" Welcome to Java... etc Is this the right one?
 icecream17: The loading bar is stuck at 95%
 icecream17: ok it's done. feel like i'm monologing now
 icecream17: aww... it still doesn't work. can't open 
 icecream17: i give up. i'm just gonna download the zip file under it
 icecream17: yay! the readme. But it's a .md file, which i never heard of
 tobk: Markdown
 tobk: Just read it as plain-text or convert to nicely formatted HTML with `markdown`
 icecream17: i don't know what you mean by the second one, so i'm just doing plaintext
 icecream17: "cg-brutaltester is a Java local tool to simulate the codingame multiplayer IDE"&#160;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 Nagatwin: Hey maybe this is not made for you and you should stick to the IDE
 icecream17: =(
 icecream17: but yeah i'm missing something when java -jar cg-brutaltester.jar -r "java -jar cg-referee-ghost-in-the-cell.jar" -p1 "./myCode.exe" -p2 "php myCode.php" -t 2 -n 100 -l "./logs/" is "simple"
 eulerscheZahl: if you use the latest brutaltester version for ghost in the cell, you have to specify that you use the old referee format
 Nerchio: how do you counter mines when you don't know they are there since you didn't pinpoint enemy location? ^^
 rwilson: Nerchio how closely are you tracking the enemy?
 Nerchio: right now it's very good but if they use silence it still takes quite a while before its super accurate
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/391e2964-2c4b-46f2-80d4-25467cd29040">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/391e2964-2c4b-46f2-80d4-25467cd29040</a>
 Nerchio: I make agents for each starting cell of the map and their moves  including silence splits so i dont know can't get better tracking
 Nerchio: also sonar :P
 rwilson: so you're likely keeping their total path  remembered to do some consitency checks?
 Nerchio: each of the agents has map of visited cells yes
 AntiSquid: my rank improved? lol 
 Nerchio: i guess when you pinpoint exact location of the enemy you should go back in action queue to see where he placed mines?
 AntiSquid: maybe i find the mood to finish my rewrite
 Nerchio: kind of backtrack
 AntiSquid: ZarthaxX you're below me
 rwilson: Nerchio - consider making a map of POSSIBLE mines ...   walk all agents path, drop mines from them at TURN X where appropriate
 AntiSquid: fix it :p
 AntiSquid: MSmits too 
 AntiSquid: emh also
 rwilson: Nerchio - in the end you'll with the possible mines , but a lot more than really there ...   if you can avoid them all, then you've avoided the real ones.  ...  yeah - exactly what you mentioned ( walk their action Q to figure it out )
 yfprojects: ping emh
 kovi: top10 is balanced now
 Nerchio: i am still in silver so mine players are not sophisticated i guess i should just add killer instinct against them
 Nerchio: if i have their exact location just go there and kill :P
 ZarthaxX: AntiSquid why are you looking at me permanently? lol
 ToastyZ: Damn, only 1 lesson that kinda teaches you how to "code"
 ToastyZ: Kinda lost ngl
 DrizzlyBear: if there is a move and a torpedo in the same turn, is the order determined by the order in which those commands are given, or does one always precede the other?
 aCat: dbx - by the commands order
 DrizzlyBear: thanks!
 aCat: This cat happy to help ^^
 aCat: ToastyZ sorry it's rather page to train your skills on various topics than to leran coding from the scratch&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: CGForEDU&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: tech.io was supposed to fill that gap
 eulerscheZahl: but wasn't a great success
 Astrobytes: Is tech.io not part of the update?
 ToastyZ: @aCat
 ToastyZ: The help was much appreciated
 ToastyZ: :ok_hand:
 eulerscheZahl: part of what update?
 eulerscheZahl: it's still maintained and used for some stuff like the SDK documentation
 Tunez: Can the battlefield size be not 15&amp;
 eulerscheZahl: but not attracting as many users as CG itself
 eulerscheZahl: you need content to attract coding newbiesand users to motivate the more experienced coders to write an article
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl the CG platform update, I thought they were updating techio along with it. Might be mistaken.
 Astrobytes: Yes good points there
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know if there are any plans to tech.io
 eulerscheZahl: in the past there was also a "playground of the month" awared with a raspberry pi
 AntiSquid: finally top 100 again lol :D
 eulerscheZahl: but i think they gave up on that now
 Astrobytes: Wow, never saw that one.Wait, I think they were incorporating platform features *from* tech.io, think that's where I got the thought
 eulerscheZahl: your playgrounds are linked on your profile now
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw that. They should link them to multis and puzzles if they're on a relevant subject too I guess
 eulerscheZahl: they are <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back</a>
 Astrobytes: That's the only one I think, other than M Smits PM on XR
 Astrobytes: I mean link it via keywords. Pathfinding, etc
 inoryy: I'm still salty they spent so much time on tech.io and let CG die out a bit in the process
 Nagatwin: kovi top 10 is balanced cause im finally in :p
 eulerscheZahl: get out
 dbdr: die?
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr what wizardry is that parcellite? it remembers my clipboard even when i restart my computer
 dbdr: there is this things called hard drive
 dbdr: can hold files
 dbdr: magci I know :D
 eulerscheZahl: wow, do i have that=
 dbdr: who knows?
 struct: any tutorial?
 inoryy: it was much more active couple of years ago, and was much less active about 2 years ago when pretty much their whole dev team was on tech.io
 inoryy: I'm glad to see they've turned around
 dbdr: my first contest was Mean Max. so it's true I never experienced a CG-made, non-community contest
 AntiSquid: maybe next contest is CG original again?
 Astrobytes: Both platforms have a lot of potential but they kind of work best together
 dbdr: supposed to be
 eulerscheZahl: true, CG lost some users.not sure if it's because tech.io got more attention. but i really enjoyed the CG contests
 struct: FB and WW were preety good
 AntiSquid: well there also a list of comapnies that were hiring along with the contest, did that have anything to do with activity?
 AntiSquid: there was *
 dbdr: kovi, are you climbing slower than before?
 eulerscheZahl: 3500 users on a 8 day contest (GitC), tsirts for top50+best in each language. about 20 sponsoring companies that you can choose to contact you when you did well
 eulerscheZahl: and a camera drone for the winner
 kovi: slower and cant get to top
 dbdr: weren't you top 3 half and hour ago? :D
 eulerscheZahl: they decided against sponsors for community contests as they don't want to earn money with the work of the community. maybe that's a part of the story why the player count dropped
 YannT: kovi: with this game there's a lot of variance
 dbdr: I also started to lose a match here and there against lower ranks. I guess the level is just increasing slowly
 YannT: there's something to be said for letting it sit a while if you wanna see if something's working or not&#160;;)
 dbdr: legend will be nice&#160;:)
 Nagatwin: Yeah :D
 AntiSquid: also random
 eulerscheZahl: i have yet to decide if i will like legend
 eulerscheZahl: depends on my side of the cut
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: fighting a boss has its charm
 inoryy: I mean, bugs in website and in games were left unfixed for months at the heyday of tech.io dev
 darkhorse64: Does someone remember how many ppl were directly eligible to Legend for UTG&#160;?
 dbdr: I think locam is the best comparison
 dbdr: same length
 YannT: they can't cut top10, that would mean like wlesavo or some bot like that would be gold boss, it feels like too high a bar to pass :p
 darkhorse64: LOCAM was top 10&#160;?
 YannT: no locam was like top30
 dbdr: something like that yes
 inoryy: plus there was a huge gap between WW and MM, and after MM
 YannT: but people in #fr have been saying they will likely take the top10 for legend in this
 YannT: seems crazy
 eulerscheZahl: after MM was BotG
 darkhorse64: #31 atm 
 eulerscheZahl: the statement alone was a turn-off to some
 inoryy: yeah, took like half a year to get to botg
 inoryy: I remember periods where general was completely dead
 AntiSquid: slow process to get to the final game
 YannT: I joined for locam, I must've been one of the only ones who actually liked that contest&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: also the SDK wasn't complete
 kovi: dbdr: i can get 3rd, but not higherbad submits pushed jolinden too high
 YannT: I don't better when I have time to work on stuff
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps YannT around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/20321741697135" /> YannT: I'm not good at like speed BFS coding
 dbdr: kovi how awful&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: I think that wood bosses were too strong: the Wood 2 should have made random movements and random shooting
 AntiSquid: locm was nice
 YannT: or other floodfill blitz contests :p
 AntiSquid: it's all personal preference YannT, who cares what others like?
 Nagatwin: I did not get LOCM at all
 YannT: I mean I will admit during locam, by the start of the last week most people were just "done" and bots pretty much stagnated
 inoryy: anyway, hopefully, they're done with the tech.io nonsense and CG contests are back for good
 Nagatwin: tried a bit but sounded not rewarding enough for the time spent, maybe I had the bad approach
 YannT: so it was a tad too long maybe
 darkhorse64: floodfill is easy: MSmits article on tech.io says all
 YannT: but on the other hand 10 days doesn't feel like enough if you've got other things going on
 Astrobytes: inoryy they said 2 CG contests per year + sponsored contest iirc
 Nagatwin: 10 days is short
 Astrobytes: *sponsored contests
 AntiSquid: Nagatwin it was during summer time too, motivation would obviously be lower without a lockdown
 inoryy: wait what's the difference between CG contest and sponsored contest
 darkhorse64: 10 days to reach legend for OOC for those who do not make the cut
 Nagatwin: 30 is fine for games like that I think, with a lot of possible improvments
 Astrobytes: One has a sponsor and one doesn't :D
 AntiSquid: was UTG a sponsored contest?
 eulerscheZahl: es
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 inoryy: ah in that sense sponsored
 inoryy: cool
 inoryy: glad to hear
 Nagatwin: AntiSquid we should make more lockdown to free some time for contests
 eulerscheZahl: they said single-sponsor contests
 eulerscheZahl: and thibaud mentioned a new staff member (i think Nanna) responsible for getting more of them
 Astrobytes: Yeah that rings a bell
 eulerscheZahl: sleeping timewhen i'm up early tomorrow, i can submit without everyone else interfering
 inoryy: they could also just crowdfund prize pools
 eulerscheZahl: no, they crowdfund girly coders
 Astrobytes: lol, og CR
 eulerscheZahl: correct
 Astrobytes: Would crowdfunding the prize pools really work?
 inoryy: CG has many professionals (just look at the company top for OOC), I'm sure at least some of them wouldn't mind helping the site out
 Astrobytes: Ah OK, sponsored funding, thought you meant user-wise
 Astrobytes: *corporate funding I mean
 AntiSquid: they wanted to promote a charity back then with each new community contest
 AntiSquid: ours was kids ... which made sense, but then for some reason they went to girls only 
 Astrobytes: Not everyone supports every cause, as they found out
 inoryy: I did mean user-wise, Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Re-reading I see that inoryy, but what would motivate them to donate? I mean, if you have a cause they don't support, they won't do it. Otherwise it's just donating money so someone can win X.
 AntiSquid: were you here when they had an ML "puzzle" Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: The image recognition one?
 AntiSquid: ya
 Astrobytes: I've been here since 2015 AntiSquid, I just didn't do anything for ages until og CR
 Astrobytes: Why did they remove that one anyway?
 inoryy: I don't mean donating to a cause either, although I think the CR thing was an okay idea as well
 inoryy: I mean literally to the prize pool and/or to cover dev time
 inoryy: Re: why do it - is supporting a website you've used for free potentially for years isn't motivation enough?
 Astrobytes: (I did too, even though it's not a popular opinion)
 Astrobytes: Yeah I would say it is, but, all people are not quite as altruistic
 Astrobytes: *equally altruistic
 inoryy: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Astrobytes: It would be worth a shot though, if people can donate 10s of dollars to someone streaming CoC on YouTube then CG must be in with a shot right?&#160;:)
 inoryy: I've definitely spent money on much less deserving things
 Astrobytes: Exactly, I doubt there's anyone who hasn't, but... people&#160;;)
 RockyMullet: Yeah, I'd be willing to financially support CG with donations
 RockyMullet: not why they dont do it, maybe tis bad PR for the clients
 RockyMullet: make them look like beggars or something
 RockyMullet: trying to be the devils advocate here
 inoryy: that's kind of true but then again their contests stuff is almost completely separate from CGForWork stuff, aside from the occasional private contests
 RockyMullet: Maybe the amoun of money they would get from it is not enough for the effort it would take to make it
 RockyMullet: maybe legal stuff
 RockyMullet: cause lets say we are like 20-30 who gives like 20$ every 3-4 months because we feel like it
 RockyMullet: in the end its not that much money
 inoryy: $1k / year is still &gt; $0 / year :P
 inoryy: but I get your point, I'm sure they've at least thought about it before and opted against it
 struct: subscribe for 1 Mill lines of code limit
 inoryy: I would honestly pay monthly for better NN support
 RockyMullet: a good exemple of it is hear in canada our healthcare is free, and there's often been discution of asking just a little money to avoid abusers, but just managing the money would cost more money then the money they'll get
 Astrobytes: Not sure a donation-based model is 'begging' as such when you get all this
 RockyMullet: to be clear, I think its a good idea and I would donate, im just trying to understand why not :P
 Chewie2k: yo guys
 Chewie2k: I'm stuck on the Power of Thor ep 1
 Astrobytes: Oh totally RockyMullet
 Astrobytes: and hi btw&#160;:)
 Chewie2k: I am very bad at coding
 RockyMullet: hey :wave::grinning:
 Illedan: hi
 AntiSquid: all money donated back then went to the charities afaik, their expenses are covered through what they usually do
 MelodraMarco: Hey Chewie. What's bothering you?
 AntiSquid: are you talking about millionaire charity owners RockyMullet&#160;?
 RockyMullet: Yeah AntiSquid, that must be it, the amount of moeny they'd get from donation is probably insignificant compared to they're other sources of income
 Chewie2k: This Power of Thor code
 AntiSquid: ^ was around 1500 euros i believe
 RockyMullet: hu I dont know about that, there was a conversation about donating to CG to support them
 RockyMullet: Or maybe I misunderstood :thinking:
 AntiSquid: ah that's a different thing then
 AntiSquid: guess i overlooked some bits of the conversation
 AntiSquid: i got new better strong faster pathing though
 AntiSquid: stronger *
 RockyMullet: I still dont do any pathfinding, maybe thats why im stuck in silver
 icecream17: me neither....
 RockyMullet: implementing mines had close to no impact on my bot
 RockyMullet: that was a bummer lol
 AntiSquid: i don't have a real pathing in the arena and it's mid gold 
 AntiSquid: i am rewriting my bot, want to make a stronger one
 RockyMullet: yeah, I feel unless you do a real agressive bot, I dont see the point yet
 icecream17: I have a function that takes 0.7ms that's called a LOT of times when I silence
 AntiSquid: this one is just a pile of bugs with a decent predictor and some if else, not sure how i got so high with it lol
 AntiSquid: so you can get gold with quite little i guess?
 icecream17: I'm jumping around the 200s and 300s and can't go up
 icecream17: I did it!
 icecream17: Sorta. It used to take 55ms with silence and 57 positions, and now it takes 43ms
 darkhorse64: This is a good incentive to switch to C++. I can handle several thousands paths
 AntiSquid: i meant tracker, not predictor, i don't predict anything yet
 AntiSquid: several thousand for loops&#160;!
 icecream17: i think my "checkPath" function is too slow. but i don't know how to optimize it or anything
 RockyMullet: yeah, what I think I might do is run my own tracker code on myself, to guess how likely the enemy knows where I am to use silence better
 AntiSquid: i don't have self tracking either in the arena
 icecream17: selfTracking sounds hard.... also if i silence and the opponent silence the time doubles
 darkhorse64: My tracking involves a lot of fancy ops per paths and I track also myself
 AntiSquid: self tracking is as hard as enemy tracking
 rwilson: RockyMullet&#160;;) working on that ATM - great idea  -- though I need to use it more to avoid giving away my position by taking a stupid turn 
 darkhorse64: Write once, use twice
 icecream17: probably easier bc you've already made it. but still hard and probably buggy, and i don't feel like it
 RockyMullet: rwilson yeah could also be used for that
 RockyMullet: well the basic dumb tracker, where you check all position to see if they bump into walls is not that hard to implement on yourself
 AntiSquid: no more TypeScript bots above me, first mile stone achieved \o/
 rwilson: icecream17 are you checking all paths for all points currently?
 icecream17: yes, but lots of logic removes most by turn 10
 darkhorse64: Tracking = silver, eval shoot + self tracking = gold 100, eval move = top 30
 icecream17: "eval" is something i hear a lot....
 AntiSquid: i don't have any self tracking though
 RockyMullet: what do you mean by "eval shoot"
 icecream17: i just shoot where the opponent is most likely to be
 struct: shoot does not only make damage
 AntiSquid: some very bugged target picker for torpedo and mines i do have
 darkhorse64: find the best shoot more damage to him, less for me
 AntiSquid: shoot eval would be a target picker i guess RockyMullet
 RockyMullet: oh yeah, I dont try to not get shot right now
 icecream17: sometimes i place a mine down, and the code says "mine is at a place that it actually isn't"
 RockyMullet: probably another problem of my bot
 darkhorse64: also probabilistic shooting
 AntiSquid: if what you said is true, i should get top 50 with my new movement picker, but i really doubt it darkhorse64
 RockyMullet: I do discrimate the enemy position based on the shot position, assuming he wont shoot imself
 icecream17: can't assume that nowadays
 RockyMullet: but I see a lot of games I lose because me and the enemy shoot at each otehr every 3 turns and I lose by 1 hp
 rwilson: RockyMullet even in silver, they'll take a little dmg themselves if it lets them win&#160;;) 
 darkhorse64: good motion is really important and has a measurable impact
 RockyMullet: my bot goes always to the right...
 RockyMullet: another problem lol
 darkhorse64: turn the wheels
 rwilson: RockyMullet - have you made sure your bot can "move torpedo|torpdeo 1 1" when it's at cooldown of 1&#160;?
 icecream17: 23rd? almost at gold
 icecream17: rwilson i stealing that idea
 RockyMullet: yeah i do that
 rwilson: noticed that agressive torpedo tactics tended to favor those who minimize time between shots ... 
 rwilson: but also, it FEELS to me like it's a bad idea to shoot first unless you're going to win
 RockyMullet: in my torpedo targeting I keep if I need to move first or shoot first, and I dont allow to shoot first if my cd is not 0
 RockyMullet: rwilson yeah my last significant improvement was to not shoot first unless im sure of a hit
 icecream17: ugh for all of silver 2 bugs "no positions", "torpedo or mine blowup didn't happen" have eluded me
 rwilson: icecream17 - second one sounds like maybe position / command problem
 rwilson: are you checking what the referee is saying in the logs?      trying to place mine where it can't&#160;?  or is it some other message?
 icecream17: "&gt; Mines: [7 6]" Onscreen: [7 7]
 icecream17: i account for move and all that
 rwilson: ahh ... so you think you've placed it at 7,6   but it shows 7,7?
 icecream17: yeah. and sometimes i try to explode the same, [correct] mine but twice
 icecream17: i'm gonna submit so i save my code so i can revert back to the code that gets 235th or something
 rwilson:&#160;;) it does sound like a bug with the accounting for movement.  I had issues with that sort of thing till i split up the commands ( enemy and my own ) and process them 1 step at a time, instead of as a group
 RockyMullet: Awww I cant trigger random pos to confuse the enemy, rude
 RockyMullet: I had to try it :P
 icecream17: If someone triggers a mine early on the number of positions greatly reduce
 icecream17: or they should
 icecream17: huh. i thought my code became worse, but the rank improved from 334th and is already at 309th
 RockyMullet: I guess, but people dont trigger mine early that often
 RockyMullet: you have to be close to the enemy and know where they are, doesnt happen often
 RockyMullet: early i mean
 Cappefra: I trigger mines based on their density on screen and the number of possible positions of the enemy
 Cappefra: just to get statistical random hits
 RockyMullet: hum, yeah maybe I should do that too
 icecream17: not sure if i explode mines too much
 RockyMullet: I only trigger mines on sure hit
 Cappefra: I used to do that too but then I noticed how often the enemy goes close to mines after they silence or something
 Cappefra: in general when their position is still too uncertain
 icecream17: also, a lot of times the opponent keeps going left straight into the mine, but i explode when they are 1 square away instead of 0
 icecream17: wonder if i should wait 1 turn before exploding
 Cappefra: Still I think my biggest one-submit improvement was when I changed the movement to zoning
 Cappefra: reduced the surface rate a bunch
 icecream17: my movement is really... complicated
 icecream17: but amazingly it's bug free
 RockyMullet: mine is ridiculously simple, its "always go right, if you hit a mine, not go left"
 RockyMullet: I probably should focus on improving that
 Cappefra: mine's gotten kind of complicated too
 RockyMullet: and its actually the change that got me straight from wood 1 to silver
 RockyMullet: so it was way worse before that lol
 Cappefra: yeah movement's almost more important than everything else, until the point where everyone moves well
 Cappefra: I move like a nokia 3310 snake and tend towards unvisited areas, with deadlock avoidance
 icecream17: 1752 to 1985. my behavior doesn't change if i get torpedoed or hit by a mine, don't know how i should react, but probably more conservative
 icecream17: *nevermind the numbers at the top accident
 icecream17: gosh, i don't know how to explain my moving
 FlatVampire_a187: ii'm new here. i can't figure out how do i dubug my code
 icecream17: i'm sorta new too but i guess you can check a lot of variables and function in the error thing
 icecream17: i've heard of "explain to a rubber duck" 
 FlatVampire_a187: oh. i'll thy it out 
 icecream17: i have a checkPath function i use to check whether a silence is good,  but i call it 4 * possibleOpp.length times and it takes too long.
 rwilson: icecream17 - are you pre-pruning the most recent step first?  or checking the whole path?
 rwilson: [here last time] -&gt; water -&gt; water -&gt; island       = don't bother checking 3 &amp; 4 length silences
 icecream17: yeah i do that
 icecream17: can't move 1 N, can't move 2 N
 icecream17: but 4 * possibleOpp.length is misleading, more like "all the paths that seem good"
 Ifthel: Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't checking the whole path avoid branching and maybe be faster?
 icecream17: unfortunately reputting "ohno (silence check)" in order behind the other checks such as torpedo and mine is too hard
 icecream17: i have a string "WSSEESSSSEN" and i have an array with the offsets
 icecream17: ugh nevermind
 rwilson: icecream17 -&#160;? repeating after torpedo check?         and By the way --- I suggest you look at your movement &amp; avoid locking yourself up in a corner too soon
 icecream17: my floodfill timeouts too
 icecream17: so i'm stuck with search 2
 rwilson:&#160;:( i take it you've got some timing checks to bail out &amp; not 'timeout'&#160;?
 icecream17: nope
 rwilson: i've not seen you timeout yet...  but shrug... 
 icecream17: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447318446">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/447318446</a>
 rwilson: i didn't put timing in there at first...   early way I simply limited to a depth/count
 rwilson: like, only let the flood fill go for 50 or 100 spaces instead of the full ~200 board
 Nerchio: i do flood fill for my movement so for 4 possible moves i check how many from there
 Nerchio: i only faced timeouts when following enemies path but at some point i just reset it with current known positions
 rwilson: icecream17 - ooof, that doesn't looke like it SHOULD have been a timeout from floodfill for movement --- less nasty bug...   
 rwilson: Nerchio - :thumbsup: definately like the ... ' oops, lets just start over' for timeouts / errors
 Nerchio: I mean the best is to have efficient working algorithm :D
 Nerchio: but tracking silence splits is a pain for how much resources it needs
 rwilson: Nerchio - you're doing the individual agents? right?    or propogating a single potential wave of possabilities&#160;?   hybrid?
 Nerchio: every non-island position at the start creates an enemy object that moves independently
 Nerchio: so agents
 Nerchio: it works well the only problem is when somebody just spams silence and does nothing else
 Nerchio: then on open maps where you need more time to narrow down agents it might timeout
 Nerchio: that's why at some point i cut some agents and start new ones from positions currently known for possible enemy
 Nerchio: sadly new agents can't remember their previous path
 rwilson: Nerchio - so essentially a particle filter for localization ...   i might need to try a version with that.
 Nerchio: i am fighting for gold right now
 rwilson: same
 Nerchio: top2 in silver but fights against cpt haddock are 50/50 =/
 Nerchio: since I don't really run away from opponents very often it's who hits first
 Nerchio: and i don't track mines at all
 Nerchio: i feel like they are very good
 rwilson: FWIW... haddock seemed to be vulnerable to silence spam ( at least for a while - i've noticed him change at least once not long ago )
 Nerchio: first atm
 Nerchio: keep your fingers crossed for me :D
 Nerchio: hm Haddock himself spams silence a lot
 Nerchio: my silence is not very optimized so I don't spam it that much
 rwilson: good luck&#160;;)      yeah, longest battles i've seen where silence spam dances in open water with no mines&#160;;)
 Nerchio: essentialy it just takes random distance, random direction and goes there if it can
 Nerchio: so it might go into bad positions or waste space
 Nerchio: damn i lost 5 out of last 6 games
 rwilson: Nerchio i think mine is similar ... ISH  ..      OUCH&#160;:(
 Nerchio: I added killer instinct to my bot vs mine spammers
 Nerchio: if i see their exact position i just go and try to win fast :p
 Nerchio: i also have a rare bug where my bot forgets it cant go somewhere
 Nerchio: it happens really rare but i am not sure why can't debug it
 rwilson: Nerchio - can or, can't?
 Nerchio: it walks into islands sometimes but it happens once in like 20 games
 Nerchio: not sure why haha
 Nerchio: damn 2nd place&#160;:( lost too many games
 rwilson: LOL&#160;;) into islands&#160;;)    ouch ... 
 Nerchio: yea i start with an island map and then i just add to it positions i've been it
 rwilson:&#160;;)  little worse sounding than my rare bug ...     I forgot to mark my staring point as visited, so RARELY it would try to walk on top of it and get killed by the referee
 Nerchio: rip gold dreams :D
 Nerchio: it's my first competition i think if i get gold it will be enough
 Nerchio: maybe if i fix the island bug i can make it
 Nerchio: will try to debug it now
 AntiSquid: competition = nothing is ever enough
 Nerchio: i know i am saying i will quit my bot for the past 4 days
 Nerchio: and i still do it many hours :D
 Nerchio: should probably add mines to my bot
 YannT: mines make killing the gold boss easy I think
 YannT: he doesn't try to avoid them
 wlesavo: gold boss?
 icecream17: what's happening in gold? 
 AntiSquid: gold boss tomorrow
 icecream17: i'm amazed at everyone.
 YannT: (I did mean silver boss though, for passing gold)
 AntiSquid: why icecream17
 YannT: just do mines and you're probably good
 icecream17: just curios
 AntiSquid: you can go to the full leaderboard and watch everyone's last games
 icecream17: not really helpful
 AntiSquid: so maybe there's some ideas to steal from YannT while he is in chat
 YannT: I have ideas, but at this point they all boil down to "rewrite everything in not kotlin"
 icecream17: i have an idea. blow up all mines, silence, make a mine, and then torpedo before you give up (if you have to surface and you have 1 life)
 YannT: becauise everything I try either doesn't do much of anything results-wise, or I don't have enough performance to make it work well enough
 YannT: because at some point the GC screws me and I randomly timeout
 icecream17: I found this game where i lost at move 275
 icecream17: turn 736
 AntiSquid: that's an achievement, the game only has 599 max turns
 icecream17: i meant "frame" or something
 Angecide: Hi, is it possibe to go back in league. I was playing average tic tac toe and suddenly I got forced to bronze league which means I am playing ultimate tic tac toe, but I am not done with average tic tac toe yet. I was still optimizing my code, so is there a way to go back to wood league and play the normal ttt?
 AntiSquid: no you can't
 Angecide: damn
 AntiSquid: you can download the game from github and set it up locally and then manually select the league
 rwilson: coughaltacountcough
 AntiSquid: or create new account 
 AntiSquid: or delete current one and remake it
 Angecide: like delete current progress?
 Angecide: or current account?
 AntiSquid: everything, but i don't recommend
 AntiSquid: is agencide some sort of chemical to kill agencies&#160;?
 Astrobytes: *ange not agen
 Angecide: ye, nothing special about the name
 AntiSquid: pesticide for unrequested job offer calls :o
 AntiSquid: oh, it's late Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Yeah I feel that man
 Astrobytes: Brain's melting
 Floryan: I was wondering if theres is a better way to organise your code than to have 18 classes in this tiny file editor?
 Nerchio: haha
 Nerchio: i did everything in 1 class then i realised its a bad idea
 Floryan: I coded everything using interface, enums and classes like i would do usually but its really annoying to find something if everything is in a single file
 rwilson: Floryan - check the forums, some fellow CG'ers have made tools to let you split out the files...
 rwilson: i don't think all languages have something yet, but you might find what you need.       but it does IMPLY that you're going to use an external editor &amp; upload with something like ( CG Sync or  CG Local )   ... as you can't split file with native Web IDE in CG
 icecream17: is there a way to run multiple games at the same time without submit?
 rwilson: i've not used it, but "CG Spunk" is a Chrome extension by a fellow CG'er that has a 'batch run' option
 rwilson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/introducing-cg-spunk/1895">https://forum.codingame.com/t/introducing-cg-spunk/1895</a>
 rwilson: ... and has FireFox option too.. 
 Astrobytes: that doesn't work any more afaik, brutaltester or CGBenchmark or a homegrown runner is your best bet 
 RockyMullet: hum, just not using silence as soon as its ready got me from 28th silver to 6th
 RockyMullet: was worth
 RockyMullet: 0.8 points from the boss, I might drift :eyes:
 D4yBr3ak: can you silence then move in the same turn?
 darkhorse64: Use it in combination with the result of your self tracking
 RockyMullet: yeah that would be next step
 RockyMullet: now I just check if, from my curent position, I dont have much place to go
 RockyMullet: making it useless
 RockyMullet: but using the self tracking would be way better
 rwilson: D4yBr3ak - yes  ( move | silence | torpedo )     ... or whatever you like...  just has to be at LEAST 1 action, and no more than 1 or each KIND 
 D4yBr3ak: that mean i can silence 4 cells right and go 1 up?
 D4yBr3ak: for ex
 D4yBr3ak: and thanks for the help
 darkhorse64: Yes but you cannot a mine and trigger it in the same turn
 icecream17: i justed checked the global leaderboard
 rwilson: D4yBr3ak&#160;:)    and just to be clear with darkhorse64 , you can't trigger the mine you just layed, but you COULD    mine 1 5 | trigger 12 12 
 darkhorse64: +1
 D4yBr3ak: ok that's great, thanks
 RockyMullet: statement says that silence can move 0 to 4, how can I move 0&#160;? since I need to output a direction
 rwilson: SILENCE N 0 
 RockyMullet: oh im dumb
 RockyMullet: cause I always do a silence to replace my move, but it means im not recharging anything
 RockyMullet: so I could instead, move and recharge, then do a silent 0
 RockyMullet: would mean I recharge everything faster
 rwilson: definately a tradeoff 
 RockyMullet: the result would be same except I would charge faster, I cant see how this can be a bad change
 rwilson: RockyMullet -&#160;;)  if you move less, you give away less infor about where you are -- and you can live 1 turn longer each time - so potentiall less dmg from surface
 rwilson: RockyMullet - BUT .. you're sitting still - enemy can close the gap or lay more mines, etc...    = tradeoff
 icecream17: does anyone know where you can practice floodfill?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/surface">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/surface</a>
 icecream17: thx
 struct: I wouldnt do recursive floodfill though
 struct: I think it recommends it
 icecream17: ok
 Zandy156: Is it just my bot's luck or are mines not that important?
 struct: mines are crucial
 struct: pb4 you here? Found a replay with maybe weird action
 pb4: shoot&#160;!
 struct: maybe its not weird
 struct: so imagine you have 3 hp and enemy 1
 struct: would your bot take 2 hp from you and 1 from enemy
 struct: on purpouse?
 struct: Its a win so it doesnt matter
 struct: I guess
 pb4: does my bot write "ik" in his message&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: lol
 Illedan: :D
 pb4: Then you're spot on
 pb4: ik = instakill = I don't care about anything else
 Zandy156: Does anything like health or turn count affect ranking? or just winning vs losing? 
 struct: just win lose
 struct: 6-0 == 1-0
 Zandy156: How many players can we expect to start in legend league when it opens? 
 struct: I would say under 20

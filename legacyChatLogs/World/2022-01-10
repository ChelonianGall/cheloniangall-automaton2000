 FORMS1: Can someone tell me why my first "if" statement wont initialize?

 5DN1L: Are your { and } correctly placed?
 5DN1L: so chaotic :P
 5DN1L: what do you mean by not initializing your "if" statement?
 5DN1L: you mean for the last test case?
 C26_1: I see something sus in your C coe
 C26_1: code*
 C26_1: In the first if statement
 C26_1: @FORMS1
 C26_1: and... why do you assign a variable outside main function
 C26_1: that would probably caught an error right?
 FORMS1: doesn't make a difference if I move it
 FORMS1: Yeah the last test case
 FORMS1: It must be syntax but it looks correct to me
 5DN1L: As I said
 5DN1L: your code only fails the last test case
 5DN1L: because there is nothing to read from after the number of temperatures
 FORMS1: wait is it 0c like the temperature
 FORMS1: or 0 inputs
 5DN1L: first line is number of temperatures
 5DN1L: second line contains the temperatures, if any
 FORMS1: does n = 1 or 0 in this
 5DN1L: 0
 FORMS1: i tried that, i made n - 0  cout 0
 5DN1L: so it won't go into the for loop at all
 FORMS1: still 500
 5DN1L: hence c is untouched
 5DN1L: You can see for yourself by debugging using cerr
 FORMS1: I just put this in above every thimg
 FORMS1: n = 1 in this, I'm sure it does
 5DN1L: what do you mean
 FORMS1: the output says expecting 0 not expecting "nothing"
 FORMS1: If (n ==0) cout 0
 FORMS1: still puts out 500
 5DN1L: because your code doesn't stop there
 5DN1L: you use an else to enclose everywhere else
 5DN1L: to stop that last line from execution

 FORMS1: the second one
 FORMS1: if what you
 FORMS1: I'm covering N=0 and temp = 0 here
 FORMS1: it's still putting out 500
 5DN1L: think about the logic for a moment
 5DN1L: if N = 0 -&gt; no temperatures to read -&gt; output 0
 5DN1L: if N &gt; 0 -&gt; read temperature one by one -&gt; output answer
 5DN1L: if (N == 0) should belong to outside the read-temperature for loop
 5DN1L: not inside
 FORMS1: ...
 5DN1L: if (N == 0)
 FORMS1: May god he's right
 5DN1L: {cout &lt;&lt; "0" &lt;&lt; endl;}

 SupercraftD: how do you seperate each variable
 SupercraftD: so there are 3 of them?
 SupercraftD: oh nvm i got it
 Robert_Campbell: i am trying to do the unary problem, and i have the string turned to binary, but i dont know how to go from binary to unary. any advice? i am attempting to turn the binary string into a char array and then iterate over it with an enhanced for lop, but im stuck on trying to figure out how to count each set of 1s and 0s and give the correct format of "0 0" for one 1 and "00 0000" of 4 0s and so on
 5DN1L: you count until you encounter a different bit
 5DN1L: you store the current bit in a variable, and when you look at the following bit, you compare it with the one you've stored
 jacek: at first i read it as urinary problem
 jacek: and thought of optimal urinal problem
 5DN1L: we do have that here :smirk:
 myman1182: programming solutions to curing UTIs
 struct: jacek i think you were right
 struct: I think its possible to do something from 5th row instead of 6th

 Robert_Campbell: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d25d0a8e-7400-4c4c-a144-a2a4972d5edc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d25d0a8e-7400-4c4c-a144-a2a4972d5edc</a>
 Robert_Campbell: so this is what i had come up with, the idea is that the counters would count up if the character was a 1 or a 0, and if it changed, it would run through adding all the 0s for the count previously before the bit changed and then reset the counter for the next time it changed bits again but my output is a little weird, i see one thing i need to fix already
 5DN1L: What is it? Maybe it's the same thing I'm thinking of
 jacek: remember its 7 bits, not 8
 Robert_Campbell: what i mean by weird is that the input is 1000011 but the output is 0 00 00 00000 not 0 0 00 0000 0 00. i know i need to force it to add the last bits because it doesnt run through based on this BUT it counted the 0s 5 times instead of 4 like i expected it to
 Robert_Campbell: it also counted 1 twice in the front
 Robert_Campbell: i think i fixed that part, i was using a &lt;= instead of the &lt; like i should have, now i just need to run the last bits, which i think i can do by just having the if statements pushed one last time outside of the forloop
 jacek: ifs :nauseated_face:
 5DN1L: How do you get the initial 1 or 0 to convert to the first 0 or 00?
 5DN1L: ah sorry
 5DN1L: ignore the question
 struct: lol jackbauer24
 struct: jacek*
 Robert_Campbell: yeah, it worked for both the "C" and "CC" tests, but failed the "%" test, and im not sure why
 5DN1L: 7-bit
 5DN1L: did you get that part right?
 Robert_Campbell: yep, thats what it was
 5DN1L: what's your output
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: that is just a lousy problem all around without the chuck norris
 Robert_Campbell: Message:&#160;%bin: 1001010 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0
 5DN1L: should be 0100101
 5DN1L: 7 bits
 Robert_Campbell: yeah, i failed the chuck norris one as well, and i have no idea where to start with fixing it
 jacek: but unary == chuck norris
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: one of the test cases is still named chuck norris :rolling_eyes:
 5DN1L: Robert_Campbell Maybe you'll pass both testcases of&#160;% and Chuck Norris if you fix the 7-bit issue
 Robert_Campbell: thats what im hoping
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: you seem smart enough, you'll get it
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: just print stuff out to error
 MSmits: cerr &lt;&lt; "stuff" &lt;&lt; endl;
 Robert_Campbell: i was going to do an if statement where if the .length didnt equal 7 to insert 0s at the beginning of the array until it does, but that doesnt solve the chuck norris problem because it is longer than 7 bits
 jacek: what does this puzzle have to do with chuck norris anyway
 MSmits: because chuck norris doesn't need 1's
 Robert_Campbell: one of the test cases is a message from chuck norris
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: he bought the rights to the url
 MSmits: jacek&#160;: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://codesqueeze.com/the-ultimate-top-25-chuck-norris-the-programmer-jokes/">http://codesqueeze.com/the-ultimate-top-25-chuck-norris-the-programmer-jokes/</a>
 MSmits: it's a meme
 jacek: i know
 MSmits: well the joke is he doesn't need 1's, i think that's it :P
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: He's make fun of CG for being afraid of getting sued by CN
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Or CP I guess
 Robert_Campbell: Message: Chuck Norris' keyboard has 2 keys: 0 and white space.
 Robert_Campbell: thats the message
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I wonder why the coderpants guys never hang out here?
 Robert_Campbell: so, i think i know what the problem is, but i have no idea how to fix it
 Robert_Campbell: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7c86ca7f-4e86-41cb-bfc2-5d5950c7d849">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/7c86ca7f-4e86-41cb-bfc2-5d5950c7d849</a>
 Robert_Campbell: i think the problem is here. specifically, not alpha characters arent being turned to 7 bits
 5DN1L: For each character, convert as usual, pad to 7 bits, then add to your binary string
 Robert_Campbell: so my first thought on that is to check if the character is alpha, and if it isnt, it pushes a single 0 first, then does everything else
 5DN1L: whether a character is alpha or not isn't relevant
 Robert_Campbell:  except for "{ | } ~ DEL" the only characters that are 7 bits is alpha, the others are 6
 5DN1L: are you sure?
 Robert_Campbell: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html">https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html</a>
 5DN1L: i mean you still have to pass the validators
 5DN1L: the code you have is fine
 5DN1L: but instead of adding the bits directly to the variable bin
 Robert_Campbell: starting from SPACE, yes. the others before space would fail
 5DN1L: use a separate variable to store the bits
 5DN1L: and count the length as you add the bits
 5DN1L: then you just add "7 minus length" zeroes in the front
 5DN1L: and add that to the variable bin
 5DN1L: then you don't have to care about whether the character is alpha or not
 Robert_Campbell: ok, now i see what you are saying
 5DN1L:  except for "{ | } ~ DEL" the only characters that are 7 bits is alpha, the others are 6 &lt;- there are still a few more between "Z" and "a" :P
 5DN1L: and "@" too
 Robert_Campbell: rip
 Robert_Campbell: missed that
 5DN1L: :P
 Robert_Campbell: this is probably taking me way too long to solve
 5DN1L: hopefully you've also picked up a few useful things during the process
 Robert_Campbell: using arrays and stringbuilder a bit more than i ever did before. so, still need more practice with it, but it is definitely helping
 5DN1L: yup, with practice you'll do better
 Robert_Campbell: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee20c604-d3d1-4c96-8594-bad213256b95">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee20c604-d3d1-4c96-8594-bad213256b95</a>
 Robert_Campbell: modified it to try and do the count method, but it wont go into the for statement in the if statement and now for some strange reason the CC test fails, it does it 3 times instead of twice
 Robert_Campbell: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16ede4cb-7c8b-44bd-88ba-00419b9ea6d2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/16ede4cb-7c8b-44bd-88ba-00419b9ea6d2</a>
 Robert_Campbell: output for&#160;%
 Robert_Campbell: output for CC
 5DN1L: Empty the variable bit for every character?
 Robert_Campbell: yeah, that fixed the CC message
 Robert_Campbell: keep forgetting if i want it to be fresh for each loop, i need to instantiate it inside the loop
 5DN1L: yup
 Robert_Campbell: still cant figure out why the if statement is called correctly but the for loop inside it doesnt do the buffer for the bit to make it 7 bits though
 5DN1L: not i == 7
 Robert_Campbell: tried, i &gt; 7, still didnt work
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_for_loop.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_for_loop.asp</a>
 Robert_Campbell: i could kind of see why not i == 7, because as the test conditional, you want it to run at 7 to make it 7 bits long, but even at i &gt; 7, which should still have it run at 7, it doesnt
 Robert_Campbell: ok, now its taunting me
 5DN1L: You have to add a zero as long as the total is less than 7
 5DN1L: not equal to
 5DN1L: not greater than
 Robert_Campbell: i see what i did wrong for the for loop, but  the concatenation is being a thing 
 Robert_Campbell: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83380ea0-6d45-4ed9-9041-4ac275476591">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/83380ea0-6d45-4ed9-9041-4ac275476591</a>
 Robert_Campbell: nvm
 Robert_Campbell: i know what i need to do
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Robert_Campbell: i have it being backwards when creating the bit variable, so i feed it to a reverse method and so the buffer is being put at the end instead of the beginning like it needs to be
 5DN1L: ah
 5DN1L: System.err.println helps you
 5DN1L: i do a lot of debug print when debugging my code
 Robert_Campbell: yeah, i have that in there which is why i thought it was taunting me at first
 Robert_Campbell: i might just take the incomplete at this point, got the&#160;% working finally and now the check norris message is not happy
 5DN1L: if you want, just take a break and come back to it later
 Robert_Campbell: i have been at this for nearly 3 hours, and new glasses are giving me a headache
 5DN1L: i see
 Robert_Campbell: can i submit this then work on it later again?
 5DN1L: just play any testcase
 5DN1L: then your code is stored
 5DN1L: you don't have to submit
 Robert_Campbell: ok
 Robert_Campbell: thank you for the help
 5DN1L: You're welcome&#160;:)

 CouscousAgha: good luck!
 ZarthaxX: nice!
 ZarthaxX: doing opp prediction clock?
 ClockSort: yes i treat the opponent as a first-class player
 ClockSort: and the end of 90ms i can play both sides of the board :P
 ZarthaxX: what?
 ZarthaxX: first class player?
 ZarthaxX: im confused lol
 NinjaDoggy: yea first class you know
 NinjaDoggy: like first class flight or something :P
 ClockSort: you know, like, front of the airplane
 NinjaDoggy: LOL
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: too late for this talk
 ClockSort: what i mean is, i dont take any shortcuts with player 2. so they get a full search just like player 1
 ZarthaxX: but is this simultaneous?
 ClockSort: yes
 ClockSort: @ninjadoggy it's thanks to you that i pushed through and built the full mcts :thumpsup:
 ClockSort: hmm, that should not be thumps.
 CouscousAgha: hey ClockSort give me back my points
 CouscousAgha: XD
 ClockSort: if i hit legend now then i'll be fresh for Google Code Jam tomorrow :D
 CouscousAgha: how did i lose with 1 trees
 CouscousAgha: LOL
 ZarthaxX: how do you make it simultaneous
 ZarthaxX: damn
 dbdr: maybe just the rollout part is simultaneous?
 ClockSort: i used a weird hack
 ZarthaxX: wanna know in pm&#160;:)
 ClockSort: i consider all my moves and all opponent's moves, pick the best of each using standard UCT, then apply both at once according to game rules, which reaches a new state.
 dbdr: ok, this is DUCT then
 ClockSort: i didn't know the name&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: Eh GCJ is tomoroow?
 dbdr: it means if each player has 10 moves, you have 100 children, right?
 ClockSort: google shows me this paper, though: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/sm-tron-bnaic2013.pdf">http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/sm-tron-bnaic2013.pdf</a>
 UndercoverToad: codejam today (in my timezone at least)
 UndercoverToad: in 10h
 ClockSort: @dbdr yes in theory, but in practice i fill the children on demand, so they don't all get created because some moves are bad enough to not be picked enough to be fully explored
 ClockSort: and i prune a lot of children before starting
 dbdr: right
 ClockSort: is this standard DUCT?
 ClockSort: lol wow the paper i linked basically explains what i do :P
 ClockSort: Decoupled UCT
 dbdr: yes, I think it is
 dbdr: it's the obvious extension of MCTS to simultaneous, I think
 ClockSort: i should get points for inventing it, but i see it's section 4.2 here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/sm-tron-bnaic2013.pdf">http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/sm-tron-bnaic2013.pdf</a>
 dbdr: we have a new MSmits
 dbdr: reinventing existing algos&#160;:)
 ClockSort: obvious in hindsight, this is the first MCTS so I've been learning/researchinga ton
 dbdr: I forgot what Smitsimax was called
 ClockSort: clearly not researching enough ha
 ClockSort: btw @dbdr congrats on #2 Rust, hoping you take the top spot by end of contest! :thumbsup:
 UndercoverToad: at the moment c# seems easier to win than rust
 dbdr: thanks ClockSort
 dbdr: I'm happy if another rust is high&#160;:)
 ClockSort: i love rust too, i learned it just because it was cool
 iggy12345: I'll be happy if I can get out of bronze
 dbdr: I already got the language achievement, in Java and in Rust
 ClockSort: one of my favorite cryptocurrencies (Grin) is written in Rust
 iggy12345: wassup guys
 dbdr: not ready to use Rust in contest yet ClockSort?
 Numby: did someone say you could get the turn input from replays?
 dbdr: Numby if you print it yourself
 Numby: Ah 
 ClockSort: in fall 2020 contest i used C# because i didn't even know C++ yet. Now I've learned C++ enough to get to Round 2 Code Jam and  ~1750 Codeforces rating. Not ready to switch to Rust yet :D
 iggy12345: psh, why would you switch to rust when you can use C?
 iggy12345: it's obviously superior
 UndercoverToad: C is not C++
 iggy12345: yah
 UndercoverToad: and Rust has similar speed
 iggy12345: because C is better
 CouscousAgha: debatable 
 dbdr: don't feed the troll&#160;;)
 iggy12345: woah woah woah
 iggy12345: I am not a troll
 MMmm____MONKE: shit, what time is it for you guys?
 UndercoverToad: 6:20am
 CouscousAgha: 4:20am
 ClockSort: i'm in USA, it's not too late
 iggy12345: 11:20 pm
 dbdr: time is  -02D 03H 39MN 53SC 
 dbdr: no need for timezones
 iggy12345: how the heck are you 2 days behind us
 ClockSort: it's :evergreen_tree: :deciduous_tree: time
 UndercoverToad: contest end
 iggy12345: oh
 iggy12345: duh
 abenner: anything I can do about rust compiles timing out, I swear my code isn't that degenerate
 CouscousAgha: btw what will happen when timer hits 0
 MMmm____MONKE: dam 6;20am and 4:20 am 
 dbdr: there is even a time change twice a year, like in reality&#160;:)
 CouscousAgha: let's say if someone submitted their code 10 sec before the timer hits 0
 CouscousAgha: what would happen
 iggy12345: well
 jrke: submission will complete
 UndercoverToad: submits and promotion will finish
 CouscousAgha: so they gonna be stuck at the bottom of the rank?
 jrke: you can submit even 1 sec before ending of contest it will be completed
 jrke: no not stuck after ending of contest all pending submissions are completed
 dbdr: I resubbed just before promotion to legend. started to get matches in gold, then in legend
 jrke: then there mega rerun for legend players
 dbdr: I wonder if that other submit also continued in parallel&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: only top100 in legend get a rerun
 Zaphus: anyone here using a brutaltester on windows?  just grabbed one, struggling with it (Zenoscave)
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Yeah it works for me
 Zaphus: it half works - it runs, but complains about negative scores - and never kills my .exes so I have dozens of them running
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: hmm I was using it mainly for python so it might be different
 Zaphus: might give it a run with python starters to see if that is different
 Counterbalance: bots probably time out
 dbdr: Zaphus make sure not to print too much to stderr
 Lysk: Zaphus I was having the same problem, I don't know how to fix it but a if the bot is slow enough everything works...
 Lysk: some folks recommended me to use cin.good() to check for valid inputs and kill the bot otherwise
 Counterbalance: my fork with the -timeout 2000 didn't help?
 Lysk: not for me
 Lysk: even with 2018 brutal tester :p
 Lysk: so, it's weird but I have a piece of code that tries to predict opp move
 Lysk: if I run it then brutal tester works
 Lysk: if I remove it then the problem with threads not dying
 Counterbalance: hmm one thing I just though of.. shouldn't make a difference, but I use g++ on cygwin for the bots
 Counterbalance: though i used to feed it VS binaries too.. as long as they're console apps that should work too
 UndercoverToad: what's that timeout 2000 fork?
 Counterbalance: just the cli branch of my fork.. it has more options
 UndercoverToad: the SDK has some constraints, did you get around them?
 Counterbalance: yes, but for timeouts of 2s it's not necessary
 Counterbalance: i have a patch for the timeout and for excessive stderr
 Lysk: what is bugging me is that it's the first time this is happening (same gcc and java version as in fall challenge)
 UndercoverToad: by default the SDK allows a total of 30s, you confuse me
 UndercoverToad: that's 15 bot interactions
 UndercoverToad: there is a timelimit for the first turn (default=1s) which can be extended and doesn't even count for the quota if I read the code correctly
 UndercoverToad: and the per-turn timeout
 ClockSort: i'm cutting too early, and by day 20 i have nothing and opponent has 8 large trees
 Counterbalance: here's the patch from the fall challenge, it still applies on master: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Counterbalance/FallChallenge2020/blob/cli/engine-timeout.patch">https://github.com/Counterbalance/FallChallenge2020/blob/cli/engine-timeout.patch</a>
 UndercoverToad: I see, you modified the SDK part too
 Counterbalance: ahhh crap the -timeout wasn't in my branch, but yes, the sdk modification is needed
 Counterbalance: that explains why it didn't barf all over the place
 Counterbalance: anyway i coded my own referee that's runs 1000 games in 10s instead of 20 minutes (the difference is less with a search bot, but losing the 20 minute overhead is nice)
 UndercoverToad: i did that last contest
 UndercoverToad: this game feels to much rock paper scissors for me to trust batches
 UndercoverToad: that's how Maug s reached 3rd: run an offline batch and then accidentally submit the wrong file
 Counterbalance: wrong as in not the batch for nr 1?
 UndercoverToad: the bot that was losing offline
 SirLoxley: Need some help with the offline Game ...I want to run it from command line but it keeps telling me "Directory src/main/resources/view/assets not found."
 SirLoxley: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=Spring2021
 Counterbalance: cp -r src/main/resources/view/assets src/main/resources/view/assets/
 Counterbalance: mvn package
 Zenoscave: I fail to see the diff in the dirs
 SirLoxley: cp: cannot copy a directory, 'src/main/resources/view/assets', into itself, 'src/main/resources/view/assets/assets'
 Zenoscave: is it casing?
 iggy12345: does the directory exist?
 iggy12345: maybe you need to make assets/assets
 Counterbalance: lame
 Counterbalance: well,checkl if .../assets/assets/ has files.. if so, then it's okay
 iggy12345: oh, but you are trying to copy a file directory into the same directory
 Kellthazar: Im running from Intellij Idea just fine...
 iggy12345: that seems redundant
 Counterbalance: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Counterbalance/SpringChallenge2021/commit/940b5926c4c12595c87c197eabd2bc6d190da73d">https://github.com/Counterbalance/SpringChallenge2021/commit/940b5926c4c12595c87c197eabd2bc6d190da73d</a>
 Counterbalance: that's a slighly nicer workaround
 Sanguigno: ca
 SirLoxley: let me take that
 SirLoxley: Ok, have to give up for the moment. Thanks though
 Counterbalance: np. That copy command should fix it though - duplicate all files in ../view/assets/ to ..../view/assets/assets/
 SirLoxley: still get nothing in localhost / test.html
 SirLoxley: that's the actual problem
 SirLoxley: anyway have to run, hiking day
 Counterbalance: have fun
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: could someone give some tips on how to do move generation for a search algorithm when there are a variable number of turns between days. I've been stuck on this for a while and I can't find a way to do it efficiently. I have all the specifics (calculating seed options, grow options, etc) but no glue
 Whiskee: I personally don't simulate days but turns, and WAIT is a turn just like the others since it can be at any point in the chain
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I tried that first but I found comparing the evaluations didn't make as much sense
 XeroOl: yeah, you need really good heuristics for that to work
 XeroOl: that can compare competently across days
 Whiskee: WAIT turns are those that update shadows, energy, etc. while all turns have a potential value of future gains
 Whiskee: if you track what you can generate from your trees, then the day itself doesn't matter
 XeroOl: yeah, it just means I'm going to have to write a heuristic that quantifies potential gains
 Whiskee: it does
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: and finding all the next possible turns from each turn is a lot of redundant calculation. But I don't know of a clean way of fixing this yet
 XeroOl: ^ that's a good point 
 XeroOl: right now what I have so far is pretty wasteful
 XeroOl: I'm at the point where I'd just be happy to get my sim done before the competition is over
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: mine just keeps timing out lol
 Whiskee: again, it isn't the only approach, but there are techniques to reduce redundancy if you go that route&#160;:)
 Whiskee: I create a hash that is unique for any combination of actions with the same targets happening within the same day
 hoang2.nguyen: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 UndercoverToad: is it just my impression or are submits slower than usual?
 Whiskee: yup
 jrke: yeah slower
 jacek: happy Caturday
 aCat: happy&#160;:-)
 kovi: submits are definitely slow
 UndercoverToad: congrats for legend aCat
 aCat: thanks
 aCat: I feel weird given waht I have inside
 aCat: just optimized heavy pruned search
 aCat: (but still got ideas to improve)
 aCat: on actually one-element heuristic
 UndercoverToad: the boss is weak, legend isn't what we are used to call legend
 aCat: I know
 aCat: and actualy that's make me feel weird even more
 aCat: I mean - 2 days of making lagend of 30 people legend of 100
 aCat: is hmmm some achivement
 aCat: and this is...
 aCat: waht - 400 people at the end?
 UndercoverToad: not if submits keep that speed
 aCat: It actually makes me loose motivation than other way oarund
 aCat: *around
 aCat: maybe because having a boss is a clear goal to optimize
 aCat: I'm not so used to be in top places and just to optimize agains a bunch of other lplayers and their meta :thinking_face:
 UndercoverToad: don't worry, you are not in the top places yet&#160;;)
 aCat: euler these ARE problems of the first world
 aCat: were talking 100/6600 
 UndercoverToad: that's top 5% but not top 1%
 aCat: I'm the memeber of the 5% 
 aCat: ^^'
 aCat: don't worry I'll be working on this
 aCat: but today got deadline for the COG reviews
 aCat: 6 papers ;p
 UndercoverToad: does that mean you have to work on them?
 aCat: read, review
 aCat: some I laready read
 aCat: one is really interesting
 aCat: 2 medium, others meh
 Westicles: Interesting, looks like terry u16 prints his odds of winning every move
 Marchete: noob question, beam search is per day (with N turns packed in the same Beam node)?
 Zenoscave: I don't think many do that
 jrke: zenoscave are you still heuristic
 Zenoscave: no
 Zenoscave: haven't been for days
 aCat: from day 4 he see &gt; 0.8 against me
 aCat: what the predictions he has :D
 aCat: must be great
 aCat: Marchete you have beam for every action depth
 Marchete: One question on top players
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555729619">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555729619</a>
 aCat: but its better (at least huge difference for me) to synchronize
 Marchete: frame 24
 Marchete: why grow 25 instead of 4?
 Marchete: there are 3 size 2 trees, and one of them seems more suitable, more centered on better richness, without nearby shadows
 Zenoscave: sun in next turns increases due to spookyness i guess. not sure though
 Marchete: there aren't directional shadows
 Marchete: at all
 CODE_LOVER: lol
 Zenoscave: hm. in the next 6 turns?
 Marchete: 25 even has a friendly shadow
 Zenoscave: true. Not ure then
 Marchete: Maybe it's because at N depth that decision was irrelevant
 Zenoscave: who knows
 Marchete: yeah, but as I'm a little retarded I wanted to know
 dbdr: rust #1, gg terry_u16!&#160;:)
 Kellthazar: Gratz!
 kovi: testing through submit is hard when submits take 2hours
 aCat: yeah, timings are awful&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: It's even worse when your code times out in IDE often
 Zenoscave: but not in submit
 aCat: true - I'm still not suer about my timelimit settings - keeping them low for safety but thats clearly suboptimal
 Zenoscave: Yeah it's hard to guage currently
 UndercoverToad: i have these IDE timeouts too
 UndercoverToad: with time limit set to 80ms
 Zenoscave: I usually take 1.5x in IDE
 Zenoscave: so try 60ms for IDE
 Zenoscave: but of course you can't guage it's effectiveness in submit at that point
 dbdr: 60 or 80 ms might have less impact than you think
 Zenoscave: impact in what way?
 dbdr: playing strength
 abenner: dbdr is there any magic rust macro for performance like the c++ pragmas
 UndercoverToad: rust is compiled in release mode on CG, no need
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 jacek: :unamused:
 abenner: oh cool is target-cpu=native also part of the rust flags?
 dbdr: I don't think so
 kovi: is it just me or there are time jumps nowadays?
 dbdr: abenner you can use fn annotations like:	#[cfg_attr(target_arch = "x86_64", target_feature(enable = "popcnt"))]
 dbdr: time jumps?
 kovi: hmm, maybe sort is slow
 tarriel: #[target_feature(..)]` can only be applied to `unsafe` functions\nsee issue #69098
 ANJACE_Z: how to raise ur rank?
 abenner: yes you can wrap safe functions around them though so it's not so bad.
 geppoz: any clue why that referee for me, it works on my centos VM, but doesn't on windows linux subsystem (ubuntu)&#160;?
 abenner: I am running it on wsl
 abenner: maybe check your java install?
 geppoz: well it seems always all bots go in timeout at first move
 geppoz: so it seems not related to java installation, they starts correctly (and I also see some of their stderr before they die)
 ddreams: dbdr was it you that asked about the missing sprites locally?
 ddreams: anyway, in case anyone else has the same problem I figured it out
 ddreams: the assets need to be under assets/assets/, not directly under assets 
 ddreams: geppoz if there is any output from the referee (like warnings) it will stop
 geppoz: ty, will check
 geppoz: but I mean, not the brutaltester, just this: java -jar spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -p1...-p2...
 ddreams: hmm, ok
 geppoz: it works if I put random move, but as soon as I put any "thinking" bot, timeouts
 ddreams: timeout can also mean crash though
 ddreams: which java version do you use?
 ddreams: i had problems with a newer one, so installed 1.8
 Michael_Howard: When you tap HISTORY on the left of the IDE and mouse-over the "About XXX hours ago", are the times in my time or CEST?
 dbdr: ddreams I have ./src/main/resources/view/assets
 kovi: hmm, i wonder if i resubmit now...will it be finished before final recalc?
 geppoz: ddreams , that assets folder solved sprite problem for me
 jrke: are submissions slow due to server or large pending submissions?
 geppoz: well wtf it seems that referee is starting with full grown trees :D
 geppoz: that's why my bots timeout
 jrke: geppoz change league level
 geppoz: where?
 UndercoverToad: #!/bin/sh
 jrke: are you talking about offline refree or brutual tester?
 UndercoverToad: -Dleague.level=3in particular
 geppoz: offline refereee
 jrke: gameRunner.setLeagueLevel(3);
 geppoz: ty
 UndercoverToad: you can do that as a command line argument too if you use Zenoscave's fork
 UndercoverToad: maybe even without, didn't test
 geppoz: I am using that
 geppoz: seems it is needed then
 dbdr: geppoz where did you copy the assets folder?
 jrke: can you gimme link for zeno's form
 geppoz: just i created another assets
 Whatar: I had to remove the other two league from inside the source code even using the fork
 geppoz: assets/assets
 ddreams: dbdr yep, but in ...\Local\Temp\codingame\assets
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 ddreams: so you have to repeat assets :p
 geppoz: all inside main\resources\view\assets\ , in main\resources\view\assets\assets\
 ddreams: ^
 geppoz: ty ddreams
 UndercoverToad: but why does it find the background but not the other assets?
 ddreams: finally local referee is useful
 ddreams: I think it's the sprite library
 dbdr: it is weird indeed
 dbdr: you need to rebuild the jar after that?
 kellbooby: hey
 geppoz: y

 jrke: i have modified referee a bit to play as many matches i can
 Maxboyer: Hey guys, i'm trying to code in Groovy and most of the time, i get timeout, but my code is quite simple ... is it something to be expected?
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi all. Did we have R language before? Now I don't see it anymore....
 jacek: never?
 Zandy156: does (-1&#160;% 6)  = -1 in C#&#160;?
 ToshiTuringMachine: what a pity. wanted to learn some R
 jacek: yes
 SabertheLost: is the battle arena superslow?
 jacek: yes
 jacek: friday deployment :heart:

 ToshiTuringMachine: wow good job devs preparing starter kits for all languages
 ToshiTuringMachine: but the server looks overwhelmed
 timbersson: Hey
 timbersson: Could anyone help me get rid of the the following message when I run the current challenge in brutaltester...
 timbersson: "10:21:07,166 ERROR [com.magusgeek.brutaltester.GameThread] ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console."
 timbersson: It looks like I need to configure logging somehow... but how?
 timbersson: I don't really know Java :disappointed:
 amzh: I have similar messages, but simulations still work fine
 geppoz: someone answered yesterday
 geppoz: you need to put an xml somewhere
 timbersson: can I find that answer somehow?
 actualCoderTrevor: timbersson I have no idea if this is right but I saved a tab earlier and I think someone said you need to edit pom.xml with these changes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2b78c7e0-87fa-4f0f-a90a-1c77f74307d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2b78c7e0-87fa-4f0f-a90a-1c77f74307d3</a> but I haven't done it myself so I may be way wrong
 timbersson: thanks trevor, I'll give that a try
 actualCoderTrevor: You're welcome let me know if it works
 geppoz: log4j2.xml in \src\main\resources 
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh yeah it could be that file
 geppoz: yes it is
 timbersson: Yup that got it. Awesome. Thanks both
 geppoz: np, has same problem yesterday, someone helped me&#160;;)
 geppoz: *I had
 Westicles: for the groovy guy, it tends to time out unless you use: import groovy.transform.CompileStatic;
 UndercoverToad: ToshiTuringMachine 11:20AMwow good job devs preparing starter kits for all languagesbut the server looks overwhelmed
 UndercoverToad: most starters were shared by the community
 UndercoverToad: staff is informed about slow servers
 Zanoshky: do you guys know the github of a project where you specify which values needs to be changed to find best version of your algorithm
 ddreams: timbersson put that into a log4j2.xml file and start the referee (inside the -r part) with  -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml
 ddreams: oh
 ddreams: I was scrolled way back
 UndercoverToad: you can try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/ParameterFiddler">https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/ParameterFiddler</a>not sure how well it does for this game
 Zanoshky: thank you Toad
 ddreams: that looks interesting
 kovi: those cgbench spammers...
 UndercoverToad: they can't anymore because of new play constraints
 kovi: i know...but what other excuse can we come up for such slowness
 ddreams: the parameterfiddler doesn't take high dpi into account :D
 Nerchio: it seems like the problems come up at similar time every event lol
 UndercoverToad: we have a :eyes: reaction from Thibaud already
 dbdr: \o/
 UndercoverToad: the param fiddler has a command line version too if you prefer that ddreams
 ddreams: Thanks, I'll try that too
 ddreams: can read it, it's just tiny
 dbdr: how slow are the submits?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: 20% in 1h
 dbdr: :scream:
 DomiKo: 15% in 1H :D
 Westicles: another memory leak?
 Nerchio: Domiko simulation takes computation from all the servers
 Nerchio: :thinking:
 CouscousAgha: those mct bots are mining the servers
 geppoz: while waiting for servers... question about montecarlo
 geppoz: how should be choosen the random move, I mean
 UndercoverToad: randomly?
 UndercoverToad: you can try to make some more likely than others
 geppoz: if i have 50 possible SEEDS, 1 COMPLETE and 1 WAIT
 UndercoverToad: was about to say that
 geppoz: WAIT should be choosen with 1/52 prob?
 UndercoverToad: that's up to you but a higher WAIT probability will most likely give better results
 geppoz: it is very different to chose 1/3 from SEED, WAIT, COMPLETE
 geppoz: then choose a random SEED
 UndercoverToad: you can try both and see what gives better results
 geppoz: well
 geppoz: problem is that is very different implementation
 geppoz: in first case I had to count every single SEED possibility
 geppoz: before to choose
 MSmits: you can also random in phases. 
 MSmits: random a grow3 or wait, random a  grow2 or wait, etc. until random a seed or wait
 MSmits: no need to consider all actions every time
 MSmits: it's messy and branchy
 geppoz: yes, that's the point
 geppoz: you are sayng the theory should work fine in that way?
 geppoz: choosing 50%-50% consecutively&#160;?
 MSmits: it could work fine, it needs to be tested. Make a parameter for it&#160;:)
 MSmits: but a lot of domain knowledge is important
 MSmits: put in the bot what you know of the game, to lighten the load
 MSmits: for example, you know with growth, it's always better to grow3 before grow2
 MSmits: so why ever allow your bot to do the reverse?
 geppoz: yes that is mathematically
 geppoz: but other things not
 geppoz: in theory SEED can be better as first in some case
 geppoz: rare case
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: but how about this
 MSmits: consider it as an option for the first action in your search
 MSmits: and then nowhere else in your search
 MSmits: so it can be chosen as a move
 MSmits: still tons of pruning done there
 geppoz: uhm in the rollout shoudn't you go pure random to have an "impartial" evaluation?
 MSmits: pure random is not the same as impartial, unless thats some kind of precisely defined technical term
 MSmits: the idea of the rollout is to make it realistic
 MSmits: realistic playouts are important, because they make you converge faster
 MSmits: pure random is almost never realistic
 MSmits: of course you take some risk by pruning in the random rollout, but as you get deeper, you can correct it
 MSmits: btw, i feel like we're talking mcts now
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits:&#160;?
 dbdr: how can he be #1?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555809312">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555809312</a>
 Whatar: maybe he throws the game when he can predicts a loss
 dbdr: yeah, was thinking the same
 jacek: or crashing after some date
 jacek: planned obsolescence
 dbdr: also not collecting points when he's winning anyways<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555809988">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555809988</a>
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: how do they even measure the probability of winning? Is it with mcts?
 dbdr: possibly
 MSmits: you can check how many nutrients are on the board and how many trees left maybe. It's a reasonable way to estimate. 
 MSmits: but i think it's silly to throw the game
 CouscousAgha: are these submissions time normal at this time of the day&#160;?
 CouscousAgha: or is it because of the weekend
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: maybe I will print my evaluation score compared to opponents to pretend like I am doing the same
 actualCoderTrevor: It's an unorthodox strategy to be sure
 actualCoderTrevor: Maybe it's to keep you from optimizing against the bot? Or just to keep you guessing lol
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: print("WAIT", "simulations= " + r.randint(100000, 400000))
 Westicles: In a bunch of his losses he thinks he is at 0.99 then drops suddenly to 0 and sort of gives up
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: interesting
 kovi: mcts solver tend to do thati was thinking about when doing breakthrough
 MSmits: solver seems painful to write for a simultaneous mcts
 ddreams: UndercoverToad needed to add "rank: 1 0" to the end of the brutaltester end of game output
 ddreams: to make the fiddler work
 Fubuchi: arena is too slow now, maybe it is because of weekend
 MSmits: mmh i named my bot exe "0.exe" and now my windows defender thingy thinks it's a trojan horse
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: crap it got deleted
 MSmits: evil windows
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 MSmits: I was teaching the other day and my students have to learn html/css so they're making a webpage
 MSmits: this guy wanted to mail his files so he could work at home
 MSmits: so i said zip it and mail it
 MSmits: apparently we have a process running that deletes all zipfiles automatically
 MSmits:&#160;:(
 MSmits: I can understand doing this for unauthorized exe files, but come on
 Astrobytes: hahaha, classic workplace issue
 ddreams: so many companies now that are sending emails with stuff like " MailScanner has detected a possible fraud attempt from "eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com" claiming to be"
 MSmits: yup
 ddreams: and it's a link to their own site
 Astrobytes: Last office I worked in, we had different levels of user with different privileges. That occasionally does not go well.
 MSmits: yeah my zip files dont get deleted either
 MSmits: it's just for students
 UndercoverToad: right ddreams, the Param Fiddler assumes an older Brutaltester protocol from before the SDK
 MSmits: but my exe files do
 MSmits: i remember trying to play a game at work, copied it from USB and then it just deleted the exe file
 ddreams: I had already modified that brutaltester line to include the scores from the game, so was easy
 Astrobytes: Just rename it to something else
 MSmits: if i could start it in 100 ms or something i could still play the game :P
 ddreams: couldn't you run it from the usb drive?
 ddreams: or would it delete it from there too :o
 MSmits: i seem to remember that worked too, but a bit slow
 MSmits: that would be really evil
 MSmits: deleting from people's USB
 UndercoverToad: evil doesn't help, I need eval
 ddreams: to keep you safe
 MSmits: same 
 ddreams: try an evil eval
 Astrobytes: Assuming ownership of any and all peripherals attached to the system
 Astrobytes: I thought you gave up euler?
 MSmits: he's still submitting, so i guess not
 UndercoverToad: just a few tiny modifications, nothing big
 UndercoverToad: codejam in 3h
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 MSmits: have fun UndercoverToad
 ddreams: gl
 <b>**UndercoverToad is nervous</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: lol, there are submits still going from 8am
 ddreams: I rejoined the fun too
 MSmits: local testing seems the way to go&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: 9am my timezone
 UndercoverToad: Thibaud already did :eyes:
 Astrobytes: yeah I saw
 ddreams: first 10 battles in no time, then nothing
 MSmits: Yeah I am guessing there's a priority queue; IDE battles -&gt; first 10 -&gt; rest
 natofp: Im trying to run brutaltester locally on windows, I did almost everything but when i launch it i get error: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/86N5vtLk">https://pastebin.com/86N5vtLk</a>
 natofp: May anyone take a look please and tell me whats wrong?
 ddreams: too new java
 ddreams: install 1.8
 ddreams: or java8
 MSmits: natofp i am assuming you're playing ghost in the cell?
 MSmits: cg-referee-ghost-in-the-cell.jar
 MSmits: because if were trying to do this for the contest, then you have the wrong referee
 Michael_Howard: UndercoverToad have you eaten the UndercoverMice whose running wheels power the servers?
 ddreams: you probably want this for this contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 natofp: I put referee from here there:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 ddreams: and you renamed it cg-referee-ghost-in-the-cell.jar?
 UndercoverToad: no Michael_Howard. and there must be a dead mouse under my roof, the room smells horribly
 natofp: yes i did
 UndercoverToad: i wish that was a bad joke
 MSmits: UndercoverToad tell your cat to eat his dinner
 ddreams: ok, well, the other problem is that your java is too new
 UndercoverToad: her*
 MSmits: UndercoverToad tell your cat to eat her dinner
 natofp: ok so i will try to reinstall java and check after this
 natofp: so it should be java 1.8 right?
 ddreams: yep
 Astrobytes: My menacing spider has migrated to the other side of the room overnight.
 Michael_Howard: UndercoverToad probably from their diesel powered soviet-era server machines.
 natofp: thanks a lot i will try this out
 MSmits: then you won the staring contest Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Evidently!
 ddreams: ten minutes for game 11, and I lost it
 UndercoverToad: i'm climbing some ranks. mostly because stronger players are in submit
 MSmits: Yeah weekends always give you the feeling you're ranked higher than you are, because everyone is submitting
 MSmits: feeds disappointment in the end result
 UndercoverToad: i'm used to it already
 MSmits: to disappointment?
 UndercoverToad: yes
 UndercoverToad: probably no tshirt for me this time. but there's still codejam to save the day
 MSmits: well you put the bar very high. I am very impressed with your succes
 MSmits: I could not get a beamsearch working that well
 Nerchio: C++ and rust everywhere again&#160;? :P
 UndercoverToad: you still have a day
 MSmits: yeah and i havent given up, we'll see
 ddreams: two days even
 UndercoverToad: my submit is so slow I have a progress circle but not even an arrow to indicate the score change anymore
 therealbeef: my submit just stopped at 14%, not even starting the next battle
 UndercoverToad: [CG]Thibaud — Today at 1:02 PMI've pinged the devs. No news so far
 Murat_Eroglu: How do you implement MCTS here? it is not a real turn based game, is it? Can anyone help me in any direction, so I can learn 
 Nerchio: from response on discord i'd assume the fix will take some time
 FrancoisB: submitted about 2h ago, before dinner, it's now at 70%
 UndercoverToad: that's all we can say. there is an issue with submits. it's reported, now we can only wait
 therealbeef: ah, thanks toad
 Michael_Howard: It still seems to be moving, just very slowly.
 Michael_Howard: As more submits come in but none get finished, it will keep getting slower.
 UndercoverToad: we've seen such cases before. it will get slower and slower, then someone reboots the server or does some other magic
 Astrobytes: *download more RAM
 UndercoverToad: :smirk:
 Numby: When two players complete a tree in the same turn how is it determined who completes first? (this matter cuz nutrients)
 Nerchio: its in the rules
 Nerchio: both get same nutrient and its -2
 CouscousAgha: hopefully the devs would be kind enough to fix it on a weekend
 cegprakash: Numby both can't place the seed
 cegprakash: you'll be refunded the seed cost but u can't use that tree on the day after
 cegprakash: it'll become dormant
 cegprakash: Nerchio he asks because he couldn't find it
 cegprakash: coz it's sometimes difficult to search 
 Nerchio: yeah but im not sure which question you answered
 ddreams: just some random info :D
 Nerchio: he asked about completion not seeding
 UndercoverToad: you can seed in a range that's equal to the size of the tree
 Nerchio: you get income for trees not in shade
 cegprakash: I see.. Numby both get same nutrients
 UndercoverToad: because they aren't spooked
 Nerchio: they aren't spooked because they are not in shade
 UndercoverToad: - Keep it clear and consise	- Avoid flavour text<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/contribution-guidelines</a>
 UndercoverToad: someone not listening to the own guidelines?
 Nerchio: its weird they want to force their goals on me.. "End the game with more points than your opponent."
 Nerchio: what if i just want to plant trees?
 UndercoverToad: all I want is a nice pattern
 UndercoverToad: but the opponent keeps placing at bad spots
 FrancoisB: should a coop game really!
 kovi: i like that idea
 Sanguigno: One plants and the other chop?
 kovi: anyway...i think now they changed the game rules...all we can do is wait...
 actualCoderTrevor: Bots that play together on a team of two versus another team of two would open up so many doors for complexity... Could be cool? :thinking:
 Nerchio: would certainly be nice to blame the other bot and not mine for losing
 Nerchio: :relieved:
 actualCoderTrevor: :laughing:
 UndercoverToad: we had code a la mode for this
 MSmits: actualCoderTrevor try code a la mode, it's not 2 vs 2, but cooperative
 RoboStac: code a la mode worked like that. There was a lot of angry bot blaming
 UndercoverToad: smits liked my bot being aware of the overall situation
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh cool I'll check that one out. I'm still pretty new to CG
 MSmits: did you accept my plates UndercoverToad?
 UndercoverToad: every time according to you
 MSmits: ok, i wasnt sure, just that many people didnt :rage:
 Nerchio: i didn't play that one
 Nerchio: sounds fun :D
 UndercoverToad: so you have 2 players in a kitchen, preparing dishes to collect points
 UndercoverToad: each bot gets 2 out of 3 total games, scores for those is added
 actualCoderTrevor: Hey this looks like overcooked with bots. I like it.
 UndercoverToad: it is heavily inspired by that game
 actualCoderTrevor: Nice
 kovi: fireworks is also coop
 MSmits: full heuristic bot won contest
 UndercoverToad: we also have a bomberman (HyperSonic)
 MSmits: that's a fun game to code for, but a real timesink
 UndercoverToad: i got a chance to see the winner's code at CalM. storing states as strings internally
 MSmits: you get hooked
 MSmits: funny UndercoverToad&#160;:)
 MSmits: I guess it doesnt matter
 UndercoverToad: no. just wasn't a good read
 MSmits: did he/she do this because of inexperience?
 MSmits: heuristic bots dont require a lot of coding expertise, but are mostly about understanding the game
 UndercoverToad: no idea. I actually consider him a skilled coder
 MSmits: ah ok, that answers that then
 UndercoverToad: also strong on RAIC
 Astrobytes: who won calm?
 UndercoverToad: morozec
 MSmits: I haven't lost a single game since my submit started half an hour ago :P
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah
 MSmits: that's 15 games :P
 UndercoverToad: so you won the first 10 smits?
 UndercoverToad: oh wow
 MSmits: I am around rank 10-30 with this bot, so it's not that weird
 MSmits: (gold)
 UndercoverToad: i know, in legend it would have impressed me
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: the main reason i want to get legend now is the huge boost in ranking
 MSmits: i will probably get top half there
 ddreams: I realized I never submitted my best bot
 UndercoverToad: that sentence could be from struct
 Noyotens: anyone in legend
 ddreams: 4-1 vs MSmits
 UndercoverToad: i'll take a nap before codejam
 ddreams: Noyotens stop asking "anyone typescript/legend/whatever" just ask your question
 MSmits: 4- 1?
 ddreams: played in the ide four times
 MSmits: ohh ok
 UndercoverToad: five
 ddreams: right, counting
 MSmits: he already forgot his loss
 MSmits: selective memory
 ddreams: hehe
 ddreams: uhh one from the last battles :p
 Noyotens:  ok   anyone have replay to how beat Miyaza
 ddreams: look at the top gold for that
 MSmits: you wont be able to see why they win though
 MSmits: there isnt a specific trick to beating boss
 MSmits: it's just... playing well
 ddreams: it's also not enough to just beat the boss
 Aweorih: anyone knows how u can run multiple "MultiplayerGameRunner" if u run ur bot locally in the checked out source of the game? (like running multiple games in parallel)
 ddreams: you also need to beat other gold opponents
 ddreams: Aweorih brutaltester
 Noyotens: i know
 Noyotens: but my alghoritm is like :shit:
 MSmits: poopsearch?
 Noyotens: yeah lol
 MSmits: innovative
 ddreams: looking through the shitty moves and finding gold
 Noyotens: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555829942">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555829942</a>
 Noyotens: myaza vs myaza
 ddreams: all the cpu is spent on boss self fights
 MSmits: dont slow down my submit :P
 jacek: time to promote in csb :imp:
 ddreams: 15-1 so far
 MSmits: lol, whyyyy
 ToshiTuringMachine: 3 hours for 48 games in wood1
 ToshiTuringMachine: I will never see gold
 MSmits: your bot with continue promoting after deadline hits i think?
 MSmits: will
 MSmits: you just cant test your stuff
 MSmits: on leaderboard
 ToshiTuringMachine: rules are different in other leagues?
 ToshiTuringMachine: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 MSmits: from bronze and up they are the same
 MSmits: so get to bronze, then write a good bot
 MSmits: but you can look up the rules in preparation
 ddreams: you can also run it locally
 TobiasA: do you have to win against a bot 100% of the time to get to the next league
 ddreams: no
 TobiasA: ok thanks
 MSmits: just slightly over 50%, if you're near to 50% it may take multiple submits to drop rating of boss
 MSmits: during which you will promote other players
 Scarfield: you have to win enough so that your score is higher than the boss score at the end of submit
 ddreams: lol multiple submits with this broken state
 MSmits: or when you stay there, under boss, other players may push you over
 ToshiTuringMachine: if you forget anything you lose 6 hours
 MSmits: (only if you're near and win vs players)
 derjack: is it only me or clash submits are slow?
 ToshiTuringMachine: codingame has never been so slow, and I've been here since 2016
 MSmits: derjack lol
 MSmits: always creative with trolling :P
 ddreams: this submit will take me to legend
 MSmits: I hope so
 ddreams: in six-seven hours
 MSmits: then you can stop wrecking me
 ddreams: :D
 Hoyer: does anyone have good resources for tree structures in Rust? I decided to learn Rust for this challenge, but I'm really stuck on this and google hasn't been extremely helpful (outside of telling me it's a limitation of Rust)
 MSmits: dbdr maybe
 MSmits: though he's known this stuff a long time so not sure if he still knows where to find
 ddreams: Trees are naturally occurring world objects in Rust. Players can harvest trees for Wood using any gathering tool such as a Rock, Hatchet, or Pickaxe. 
 Marchete: wish you luck to pass legend Kodle and MSmits :D
 CoderDJD: I'm literally stuck with bronze, any context which might help?
 MSmits: thanks Marchete
 MSmits: i am mostly param fitting today, maybe coding  a new search to experiment with, while I wait
 MSmits: CoderDJD efficient seeding, try not to shade your own trees. Watch lots of games. during a turn if you grow something to size 3 and something to size 2, grow the larger first
 MSmits: seed last (generally)
 jacek: ^W^ <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aEpAXPo_700bwp.webp">https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aEpAXPo_700bwp.webp</a>
 MSmits: generally not needed to have more than 1 seed at a time
 Kodle: haha thanks Marchete! finally managed to port my python search over to c++ for the speed up haha, seems to be doing alright fingers crossed&#160;:)
 CoderDJD: Thanks MSmits, good luck with legend!
 MSmits: thanks
 pn2501: Hoyer you can look for arena tree <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dev.to/deciduously/no-more-tears-no-more-knots-arena-allocated-trees-in-rust-44k6">https://dev.to/deciduously/no-more-tears-no-more-knots-arena-allocated-trees-in-rust-44k6</a>
 MSmits: Hoyer i am not sure how it works with Rust, but in c++ i just make a giant array and index to it
 MSmits: is that not an option?
 SabertheLost: My submit just beat my friend. So maybe top 500 silver.
 MSmits: gj
 Porsuk: I have seen people make the forest creatures say stuff
 Porsuk: how do they make it?
 MSmits: cout &lt;&lt; "COMPLETE " &lt;&lt; bestChild-&gt;actionIndex &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; endl;
 ddreams: add text after your command
 AlMualem: print(Action,"your text")
 Porsuk: like print("GROW 25 my comment")
 Porsuk: ah
 Porsuk: okay
 Porsuk: will try, ty
 AlMualem: de rien
 CaptainHamburger: MSmits code leaked?:scream:
 jacek:&#160;?
 dbdr: Hoyer: a performant way for trees is to represent nodes as indexes in a large Vec / Array
 ddreams: 21 battles in one hour, nice
 TobiasA: oh i thought it was only me
 FrancoisB: Hoyer: Google Rust Arena
 elderlybeginner: 52 in 3 hours :wink:
 CaptainHamburger: Im winning i see: 27 battles in 2 hours
 ddreams: and one of them against my previous bot
 struct: hello
 TobiasA: hi
 ddreams: hi structure
 ddreams: do you get pinged from that, btw?
 struct: no
 Hoyer: pn2501 MSmits dbdr I was also having trouble doing it that way, since you can't initialize an array with empty values and I couldn't get my Node struct to derive from Copy
 struct: you can initialize an array with empty values
 Hoyer: in rust?
 dbdr: doing MCTS?
 struct: ah in c++ I can
 struct: GameState* Agent::states[3] = {new GameState[1000000], new GameState[1000000], new GameState[1000000]};
 struct: static GameState* states[3];
 elderlybeginner: how to compile contest referee (referee.java) into jar?
 dbdr: Hoyer: do you want it initialized or uninitialized (unsafe but instantaneous)?
 ddreams: elderlybeginner use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 ddreams: but you have to use maven, e.g. mvn package
 ddreams: if that's what you asked
 natofp: Im running brutaltester on Windows locally and exe programs which i test stop working after the game, does anyone know what might be the issue?
 cegprakash: 1 day 19hrs left.. Me Panics
 ddreams: if c++ probably not checking if stream in is still good
 elderlybeginner: i installed mvn, make target, now how to get referee
 Hoyer: dbdr I think I could make my program work either way
 cegprakash: elderlybeginner get the referee jar from someone who already built
 Hoyer: Right now my focus is completing in time :sweat:
 natofp: thanks a lot again ddreams
 elderlybeginner: anyone eager to share referee? :wink:
 cegprakash: but from I experience I think brutaltester can help u improve 50 ranks not more
 dbdr: Hoyer: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/312ad417-7f31-4b29-b677-79dede1d13d2">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/312ad417-7f31-4b29-b677-79dede1d13d2</a>
 dbdr: this should be very fast, but uninitialised, so up to you to initialize before use
 dbdr: each node
 Hoyer: hm yea makes sense... I guess you keep the node array in the main function then? I was trying something like this as a static variable, but Rust really didn't like that either
 Hoyer: Lots of occasions where I need to change my way of thinking with this language
 Hoyer: :grimacing:
 dbdr: if you use a static you will need more unsafe&#160;;)
 CoderDJD: good luck to anyone whose tryna pass some level. Have fun.
 dbdr: I store it inside a struct, which I initialize in main,before the main loop
 Hoyer: that makes sense
 Hoyer: alright I'll get to work, thanks for the advice everyone&#160;:) 
 ddreams: elderlybeginner after mvn package the referee is in the target directory
 struct: damn top is so close to each other
 natofp: OK i still got the problem that when testing locally programs stop working, im using exit(0) when i wait during 23-th day, shouldnt it be ok? or should i close those programs with some command?
 ddreams: should be ok, so attach a debugger and see where it's stuck
 elderlybeginner: ddreams am I missing something<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/HrIMSpu.png">https://i.imgur.com/HrIMSpu.png</a>
 ddreams: looks like you have compiled brutaltester
 elderlybeginner: and I don't see referee
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 ddreams: ^ again, there's the referee
 elderlybeginner: there is uncompiled referee.java in sources, brutaltester uses jar filesthis is all my guessing as I have no idea about java
 ddreams: you are completely ignoring what I'm saying, so...
 TobiasA: this taking a long time
 TobiasA: i submitted a while ago and it is still in 15%
 elderlybeginner: ddreams :wink: it's not about ignoring, I'm just like a child which does not understand
 ddreams: brutaltester does not contain this game, you have to download it separately and compile it
 CouscousAgha: any update on submits speed?
 ddreams: 24 games in two hours
 ddreams: so codingame is still broken
 Noyotens: y'all testing is same time
 Noyotens: this broke the server
 CouscousAgha: well its the last weekend for the contest so i guess the servers werent ready for this
 Astrobytes: This is ... fun.
 Fluxor: same here.... 25 games in 2h
 Astrobytes: there are submits still going from 5.5 hours ago
 CouscousAgha: 40 in 3h
 Fluxor: I guess it is useless to try and deduce anything from the result, since all IA will have changed in meanwhile...
 Fluxor: Well, I do use brutal tester locally, and I submit only when I have at least + 20% win after running 500 games against myself... but unfortunately it tells nothing about the impact on the ranking. I happens that improving against myself just makes things worst against other...
 Fluxor: at the end, only the real arena can tell...
 ddreams: same
 MSmits: this is true
 ddreams: though every time I've reached 70%+ i've improved ranking, but that's not in legend
 ddreams: rank 30 in gold now after 25 fights, one loss
 Scarfield: 596 submits atm&#160;:'(
 MSmits: rank 41 gold 28 fight 3 losses
 ddreams: Fluxor: do you get any significant difference in win percentage after 150 games?
 aCat: Magus nice&#160;!
 aCat: I see now changes, something is happening
 aCat: (except very slow resubmits ofc)
 elderlybeginner: brutaltester uses jar file as referee, how to compile referee.jar from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 struct: looking nice MSmits
 Noyotens: #save_codingame_server
 aCat: better use Game runner directly from this project
 struct: also my promoted bot on gold that was like 0.01 away from boss
 struct: is 40th legend...
 MSmits: it's not enough yet, but i hope a param fit will get me there
 Fluxor: Before I resubmit, I was happy to have climbed from 38th up to 24th in legend, without submitting anything... but I guess now it is just because all the top players that resubmitted were stuck playing games at the bottom, too bad&#160;:-(
 jacek: you have pretty avatar
 Fluxor: ahah you too&#160;:-D
 CouscousAgha: lost brothers
 ddreams: elderlybeginner as I said before: mvn package
 ddreams: will make spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
 ddreams: that's the referee/game
 Michael_Howard: Just for a change, a reverse roast request  - what is Miyaza doing wrong in this game I (or we) should be exploiting more? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555848522">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555848522</a>
 ddreams: it's your bot, right?&#160;:)
 Michael_Howard: I didn't write the boss, no :upside_down:
 Michael_Howard: And he normally murders me, this game is unusual.
 ddreams: oh, yeah, it was Bernard_Lowe
 UndercoverToad: let us know if you need another murderer
 ddreams: he probably started on the wrong side of the board
 ddreams: silly mistake
 Michael_Howard: UndercoverToad I'd *love* to get to the place where you can murder me.
 UndercoverToad: oh, you can't even select you as an opponent
 UndercoverToad: maybe you are in submit?
 Michael_Howard: Yeah.
 UndercoverToad: in slow sneak submit
 lpellieer: how do you guys evaluate your moves&#160;?
 ddreams: double eval = evaluate(g);
 ZarthaxX: kodle is using c++ OH MY GOD
 ZarthaxX: the python guy D:
 Numby: Is it normal if I played 2k games from start board with random moves that all 2k end up as ties :S
 VizGhar: with same seed completely normal&#160;:)
 ddreams: it's not normal to play 2k games with random moves though :p
 ddreams: jk.. you're doing mcts?
 MADDY-1: hii bruh
 Numby: I'm not changing seed and keep calling Random.nextInt so should be fine
 Numby: Yeah doing mcts or trying to lol
 UndercoverToad: kodl e gave up on python? i'm genuinely surprised
 Numby: I already tested by game advancing logic and it looks good. I basically replayed an entire game from a replay end to end by just selecting the action and apply it and end state matched perfectly
 struct: Just wait until I submit my pascal bot
 Astrobytes: Well, this is a productive day.
 UndercoverToad: you don't have a Pascal bot
 UndercoverToad: as a codejam player, is it bad to be happy about the slow CG platform today so I don't miss a lot?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Astrobytes: not at all :D
 elderlybeginner: is this java version issue (referee):<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/b9TNU3S.png">https://imgur.com/b9TNU3S.png</a>
 ddreams: yes 
 ddreams: how's the code jam going?
 reCurse: 639 computing o.O
 DomiKo: 36% mmmm
 Zanoshky: my bot beats boss 10/10 rounds, but I am still not promoted, why?
 DomiKo: 64 battles in 4H :D
 Astrobytes: This is almost funny.
 Zanoshky: where is the codingame employess? why not spin off more was isntances?
 Zanoshky: aws*
 reCurse: Because it's not your money?
 Astrobytes: Thibaud (community manager) pinged the devs. Heard nothing since.
 CouscousAgha: because you dont pay anything 
 Cjx_1: glad its being looked at. This is killing me--soo close to gold
 Cjx_1: just want to crank out a few more iterations lol
 reCurse: Ping doesn't mean looked at
 Noyotens: 2 games in houy
 Noyotens: *hour
 ddreams: I pay a lot because I code for the contest instead of for clients
 Astrobytes: ^ what reCurse said
 reCurse: Also long weekend in France so maybe people are out of reach
 reCurse: Great timing
 Cjx_1: big hol, right?
 ddreams: would be happy to pay my part of the servers
 Astrobytes: Perfect time to have a contest.
 ZarthaxX: true
 Astrobytes: Cause nothing will go wrong.
 ZarthaxX: so basically results are known already
 UndercoverToad: that's what you get for hosting a contest during codejam
 ZarthaxX: cant beat without submit testing
 ZarthaxX: what toad :rofl:
 UndercoverToad: what i'm writing makes no sense
 Astrobytes: How unusual :P
 ZarthaxX: haha
 CouscousAgha: UndercoverToad how long is codejam
 UndercoverToad: 2.5h, starts in 45min
 ZarthaxX: submits are literally freezed
 ZarthaxX: damn
 CouscousAgha: oh it's just gonna start? lol
 reCurse: Not frozen just very long
 UndercoverToad: but it's round 2 already, you have to be qualified from a previous round to play
 CouscousAgha: i thought it's already on
 ZarthaxX: reCurse sorry i meant that
 UndercoverToad: i'm preparing right now (starting IDE, tasting the interactive problem setup, ...)
 ZarthaxX: this is not gonna get better anytime soon
 ZarthaxX:&#160;:/
 ZarthaxX: popularity hurts :P
 ddreams: undercovertoad how does it taste?
 dbdr: don't eat the problem! bad toad!
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Cjx_1: do we not do lab saftey in cs?
 Astrobytes: ZarthaxX: BUT THE NUMBERS THO'
 ddreams: you can disappoint so many people at once
 ZarthaxX: damn numbers astro
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 ZarthaxX: highest ever excepto for the accoutnant?
 Astrobytes: Donno. Haven't looked tbh.
 ZarthaxX: toad has to know
 natofp: did anyone have issue with programs stopping during local testing? im dying from tilt
 geppoz: natofp are you sure you are launching correct league level? I had same problem launching wood league...
 natofp: how do you change it?
 geppoz: runner.setLeagueLevel(3);
 AlMualem: i have issues with battles&#160;:/ too long
 geppoz: in CommandLineInterface.java
 Cjx_1: all of us do Al
 SabertheLost: good damn, I gave cost to grow seed the same as grow tree size 2. It almost never thougth it was ok to grow from seed
 Cjx_1: the wood spirits are prepareing their counter offensive
 tobk: This is getting ridiculous. Submitted 4h ago, now at 40%...
 reCurse: It's going to get more ridiculous don't worry
 CouscousAgha: wait until codejam starts
 AlMualem: one Eternity later.....
 struct: I think its time for a csb promotion
 ddreams: 657 submissions calculating
 ddreams: codingame has it's own code jam
 Astrobytes: hah!
 CouscousAgha: tfw it's been almost 4 hours and u still didnt reach the point to know if your bot is better or worse than before
 JohnCM: think now need to wait a while for the rankings
 tobk: also, I think rankings are pretty messed up because so many are still calculating and thus do not have their proper rank
 ClockSort: i'm 8th gold and afraid to resubmit due to the backlog. is it common to drift into the next league?
 ZarthaxX: ClockSort yes
 UndercoverToad: "tfw it's been almost 4 hours and u still didnt reach the point to know if your bot is better or worse than before"
 ZarthaxX: but submits are too slow for you to get pushed fast
 JohnCM: clocksort i think you can just wait for someone to bump you up to legend
 ZarthaxX: haha toad :P
 elderlybeginner: when is the best time to jump up a league? when it's just open?
 UndercoverToad: depends on whether CG can repair their servers ClockSort
 ClockSort: hi @JohnCM &lt;3
 JohnCM: i just hope to beat this silver boss this time, haha got lazy to code this challenge
 UndercoverToad: at the same time if you resubmit it won't be any faster
 UndercoverToad: just wait it out
 ClockSort: thanks @UndercoverToad
 JohnCM: intending to do it purely heuristic-based. my silver code was like 30 lines
 JohnCM: now i need to add more stuff for tree positioning to get gold
 elderlybeginner: my gold code is like 30 lines still :joy:
 JohnCM: wow that's advanced heuristics
 elderlybeginner: +starter
 UndercoverToad: you can always improve your heuristics with a simulation
 daniserrano7: I got to gold for my first time ever!!!
 ddreams: gratz
 elderlybeginner: simulation needs to score the position, which needs to put all shadows on the board, which leads us to +50 lines at least :joy:
 ClockSort: i'm at 1200 lines... keep writing :P
 daniserrano7: But my code is 300 lines :sweat_smile:
 UndercoverToad: around 650 lines including dead code
 struct: o.o
 UndercoverToad: didn't get my opponent sim to do any better than without&#160;:(
 JohnCM: all the best clocksort
 JohnCM: haha i actually intended to do monte carlo tree search but was too lazy to code out the game sim
 UndercoverToad: i don't think that this game is a good candidate for plain MCTS
 kovi: in the morning i was jking about last submit before recalc...but now...
 UndercoverToad: but some top Japanese players are tweeting about DUCT
 ClockSort: i'm using DUCT MCTS which is why i'm not in Legend :D
 ClockSort: j/k
 JohnCM: what's DUCT MCTS? got link to that
 ClockSort: section 4.2 here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/sm-tron-bnaic2013.pdf">http://mlanctot.info/files/papers/sm-tron-bnaic2013.pdf</a>
 daniserrano7: Do you think its possible to reach legend with pure heuristics?
 UndercoverToad: yes, there are some heuristic bots in legend
 JohnCM: definitely, if you can code the heuristic well enough, you can reach legend
 ClockSort: getting setup for google code jam now. see you in a couple hours!
 ddreams: gl ClockSort
 daniserrano7: cool!
 ToshiTuringMachine: hi ZarthaxX how are you?
 reCurse: I get the impression there's something O(n^2) going on
 Wontonimo: yesterday i finished a MCTS , it performs worse than my MC-1ply bot (rank 140th), probably around 600th overall.
 geppoz: MC-1ply means?
 jrke: damn 52% battles in 5h
 CouscousAgha: im sure someone is mining ETH with their bot
 reCurse: I wouldn't be surprised if you stopped everyone submitting, then queue by batch of 100 people submitting, it would be 3x faster
 Wontonimo: MC = montycarlo.  1ply means no tree search, just check all first moves geppoz
 JohnCM: haha think i only get one good submit before comp ends
 JohnCM: means a greedy AI per move is decent alr
 struct: oh well back to brutaltester
 Astrobytes: I've lost what little motivation I had
 struct: good thing I got promoted yesterday
 kovi: is this hurt your smurf testing recurse?
 kovi: oh btw karliso is bronze...
 CouscousAgha: are smurfs allowed in spring challenge&#160;?
 reCurse: If I have a smurf I'm not doing too good now am I
 dbdr: reCurse, according to JBM it's the match scheduler that gets overloaded
 reCurse: I think I heard CG say something like that before with their DB
 reCurse: Thought they fixed something&#160;:/
 JBM: i wasn't that assertive
 dbdr: sudo reboot
 dbdr: * it works now *
 reCurse: It's a long weekend in France right? What are the odds everyone is unreachable?
 struct: yes
 JBM: wouldn't make much sens
 Astrobytes: The total absence of any communication would support that theory
 JBM: i mean, they picked this week *because* it's a long weekend
 jrke: what will they do for battles now 600+ ongoing submits
 JBM: it's not like it's a surprise to them
 reCurse: The total absence of communication would have made CG go out of business 3 years ago, not the point
 dbdr: live dangerously!
 ddreams: Astrobytes no communication? I've heard several times today that Thibaud made an emoji comment this morning
 Astrobytes: Yes. That's all.
 JBM: i'm sure he told the devs about it, yes
 UndercoverToad: he also wrote a line
 ddreams: oh my
 Astrobytes: Oh yes. Thanks toad.
 dbdr: :D
 DomiKo: Good luck in Code Jam!
 UndercoverToad: IDE :ballot_box_with_check:sheet of paper  :ballot_box_with_check:
 DomiKo: pen?
 UndercoverToad: do you play too DomiKo?
 UndercoverToad: pen  :ballot_box_with_check:
 DomiKo: ofc
 UndercoverToad: same name as here?
 DomiKo: yap
 UndercoverToad: oh no, cat entered the room
 UndercoverToad: why now?
 UndercoverToad: just go to sleep
 Astrobytes: They know things euler. Always.
 UndercoverToad: parked her at the window
 Astrobytes: good luck with that :D
 dbdr: inb4 euler's cat gets sick
 ddreams: over the keyboard
 UndercoverToad: 40s, see you later
 ddreams: gl
 dbdr: glhf
 Astrobytes: best of luck to you both
 Gabbek: good luck!
 DomiKo: another slow servers&#160;:( 
 kovi: maybe too many wrote heuristic + dogecoin mining instead of real search
 reCurse: Another funny theory I have is the initial 10 matches get higher priority, people wonder why submit is stuck, resubmit, repeat...
 struct: They probably do
 struct: There is no other explanation on why they get computed so fast
 dbdr: nice theory
 MSmits: reCurse +1  That's a good one
 MSmits: also because they want a better start, they do it a few times
 Wontonimo: the first 10 seem to be executed all in parallel, where as the rest are serial
 MSmits: 32 wins, 4 losses, rank 7, at 29%... maybe it's enough for legend?
 struct: probably msmits
 struct: come back in 4 hours
 dbdr: you need 100% for legend
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: that's the hardest
 kovi: at this rate...you dont need to comeback
 Gabbek: I've submitted 7h ago and it's on 50%
 kovi: slowdown is exponentioal
 Gabbek: so I imagine you should wait about 10h&#160;:(
 Noyotens: guys why i cant debugging
 struct: oh god
 struct: Guess I will wait until 1 am or something to submit
 kovi: and +1 for recurse...i looked at red circles on leaderboard...the more submission the more slower it gets
 DaNinja: chopped trees causing log jam
 Noyotens: guys why i cant debugging
 MSmits: that emote doesnt work
 ddreams: Noyotens how can anyone answer that?
 struct: print to stderr
 kovi: in the morning it was 2hours/100%, then 2hours/30%...now additional 5 hourse for another 30%
 dbdr: kovi:  696 results found for «Score - Computing» 
 Noyotens: i can answer
 Noyotens: but
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: the number of red circles is crazy, I just checked lo
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: lol*
 Noyotens: i cant do console.error
 Marchete: maybe if we all resubmit at once it will be fixed!
 ddreams: creative way to clear up the jam
 Wontonimo: glad i stayed up late last night and got in a last submit.  it went fast
 Noyotens: still not working ;_(
 Wontonimo: Marchete :joy:
 ddreams: I did a speculative submit instead of letting my gold #1 bot stay
 Noyotens: still not working ;_( :cry:
 reCurse: Stop with the spam and useless questions
 MSmits: yay another game, rank 4 now :P
 CouscousAgha: no update?
 MSmits: I just got 1. A game fininished!
 MSmits: I'm just brutaltesting locally... hopefully that will eventually translate to something good on  the leaderboard overnight
 MSmits: we can at least, still code our ideas
 ddreams: true, but I miss being able to test against the people in legend
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: there's probably some way to do it if you know the agent ID
 MSmits: I guess CG bench can help you there
 reCurse: Let's make things worse!
 MSmits: no, i meant, run 1 game
 MSmits: not 100 :P
 reCurse: Why 1
 MSmits: because IDE doesnt let you select agent id
 MSmits: of legends
 MSmits: when you're in gold
 jrke: whats CG benchmark btw
 reCurse: Ohh
 jrke: i don't know about that
 jrke: any link?
 reCurse: That's fixable by a few lines of greasemonkey
 MSmits: it's a program where you basically run IDE without browser, so you can chain games and get statistics, but its not really working now. Nor should you run it when the server is taxed like this
 reCurse: Wasn't there a whole extension based on that?
 MSmits: i was merely mentioning it because it allows you to put in agent ids
 reCurse: CG Enhancer I think
 MSmits: reCurse yeah, but it doesnt work anymore i think
 reCurse: Ah
 MSmits: not sure
 reCurse: Sucks
 Noyotens: i am gonna use netural networks
 Noyotens: the AIs is coming
 Fluxor: MSmits: same here, I got some nice improvements according to brutal testers results, but I hope it translate for real...
 MSmits: if you cant spell it, maybe try something else :P
 MSmits: I'll be quite happy just to get legend
 CouscousAgha: jackpot! i got 2 games at the same time
 MSmits: even though many people got in there with the so called *easy boss*. It was not easy for me at all
 MSmits: CouscousAgha one game from a different players' submit
 MSmits: doent count for your 100%
 CouscousAgha: never felt this good since the first time i hit top10 in gold
 struct: I think im going to try duct, i still should have enough time
 MSmits: do some duct struct
 Payalord: I can't run my contest code in IDE at wood 2 league. Is it disabled?
 MSmits: put some puct in the duct as well
 struct: I never did it though
 struct: But I dont see my current bot going any further
 Marchete: never &amp; 2days &amp; duct
 Astrobytes: DUCT or delete
 Marchete: I don't know
 MSmits: struct, If you do Duct, i have an easy way to test without completely messing things up
 MSmits: start at the end of the game. Duct the last few turns
 MSmits: then work your way back
 MSmits: keep rest of bot for earlier turns
 Noyotens: i cant use AI without dubegging :cry:
 MSmits: end of game is simple/easy
 Payalord: So for those who is late for the contest Play My Code doesn't work anymore in wood 2 league right?
 struct: ill try it, thanks
 Noyotens: no i am in gold
 CouscousAgha: Payalord everyone are having server issues 
 MSmits: Payalord the servers are overloaded
 actualCoderTrevor: Plot twist: Noyotens is an AI
 Payalord: Ok i see
 Noyotens: no i am human
 Payalord: so it works but not for everyone
 actualCoderTrevor: That's just what an AI WOULD say
 Payalord: lol
 Noyotens: ur right :bot_face:
 Noyotens: why there no emoji
 MSmits: they dont get created on demand
 Payalord: hack the chat and implement bot emojis lol
 MSmits: :robot:
 Noyotens: MSmits u also think i am AI
 MSmits: maybe a bugged AI&#160;:)
 Noyotens: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: oh, i thought ClockSort went legend with his mcts, but he's still here
 MSmits: in gold
 Payalord: Detroit: become human
 Noyotens: i bugged the server that's why u cant submit *bugged AI sound
 Payalord: I think I'll pass this contest. Too late for me
 ToshiTuringMachine: guys what's the command to make a jar from spring challenge referee?
 Altaire: mvn clean install
 DaNinja: mvn package
 Wontonimo: no Payalord, you could get to Silver in the time remaining with just a ifelse bot
 jrke: i am in gold with if else bot
 Payalord: I can't even test my code man
 cegprakash: Payalord
 Payalord: Play My Code in IDE here doesn't work at all
 alchemsti: I think you can get to bronze by just spitting back the last viable move (they give you a list) and maybe waiting on the first turn.
 Wontonimo: MSmits my MCTS can't break 400th Gold.
 cegprakash: sort all possible moves by target index and print the move with lowest index that takes u to gold
 cegprakash: we are all in gold
 cegprakash: with 1 sort u can come to gold
 Payalord: I was late to the contest
 struct: Wontonimo is it single player mcts?
 Payalord: And no option even to test the code now in wood 2
 Payalord: When i click play my code in IDE nothing output
 Payalord: No info at all
 Payalord: No turns nothing
 cegprakash: reset code
 Payalord: tried
 Payalord: same
 Payalord: restarted browser reloaded page
 MyCCODE: Who knows how to solve  rubik cube
 Wontonimo: struct - yes, single player + very minimal heuristic for rollout = 600th gold
 cegprakash: Payalord reset code should print "WAIT"
 IamQuan:&#160;:&gt;
 IamQuan: heh...
 Wontonimo: struct - i may make it 2 players tonight.  meh
 jrke: i think that minimax can give legend
 struct: im going to try dutct yeah
 struct: duct*
 Payalord: Ok i have tested from firefox now and it worked finally
 Wontonimo: nice
 Payalord: So might be something with my chrome then
 MSmits: jrke if heuristics can give legend, then any search can also
 MSmits: so minimax too, yes
 jrke: my bot is having patience 
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555873961">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555873961</a>
 jrke: lol
 MSmits: Wontonimo I think mcts can work here, but in general, i find it pretty hard to configure a search (pruning/ eval) in such a way that it beats a good heuristic bot
 Wontonimo: i'm not sure heuristic can get there anymore with so many new search bots crowding top of Gold
 MSmits: that shouldnt matter
 MSmits: if they are better than the boss, they are out
 Wontonimo: Agreed MSmits, there is definitely a lot of heursitic in my MCTS
 MSmits: correction, if they are better than the boss, they are out... tomorrow
 Wontonimo: well, that ain't me then.  my bot doesn't beat boss regularly
 BrunoFelthes: omg, submits are stuck
 Wontonimo: I was chasing your progress all last night MSmits&#160;:)
 cegprakash: I don't know if my bot is climbing rank because it suddenly starts winning or submits are stuck for others
 ddreams: yay, I found a bug in my bot, wonder if fixing it improves it :p
 Astrobytes: No. By Marchete's Law it will be orders of magnitude worse.
 MyCCODE: I'm having a temperature quiz where you have to write a program that will return the closest temperature to 0 but I don't know how to check if we have to do the "POSITIVE" or the "NEGATIVE" number in the output
 Wontonimo: (someone isn't working on the contest)
 geppoz: :D
 aes-salm: I TEST IN ARENA about 30 minutes ago and BATTLES IN PROGRESS 14%, did anyone have the same problem?
 ddreams: 700 people have the same problem
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's overloaded now
 nicknameasterix: yes, I do 
 TobiasA: i have the same problem
 TobiasA: mine is 30% in 3 hours
 BrunoFelthes: all contests, same problem
 ddreams: 28% in 4 hours here
 MSmits: 31% 
 ddreams: If it's the matchmaking that is the issue, CG should make a contest about it
 MSmits: got my first real ladder match vs boss
 ddreams: share it?
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555878421">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/555878421</a>
 ddreams: sim perfect?
 MSmits: oh yeah, every turn i check the sim vs next state of the game
 MSmits: to see if it got predicted correctly
 MSmits: i try all opponent actions and make a list of states
 MSmits: it should be among the list
 ddreams: ah
 MSmits: if it's not, then my sim has a bug. I forgot to remove it after testing, but kinda like it
 FrequentlyMissedDeadlines: North Korea proposed to lend their computer! it should double the compute
 ZarthaxX: got a battle too MSmits!
 ZarthaxX: what a great day to be alive
 ZarthaxX: lol
 MSmits: hehe 
 MSmits: hopefully my bot does well. Maybe i can pull him down a bit
 MSmits: (the boss)
 MSmits: oh you're legend ZarthaxX
 MSmits: nice
 Michael_Howard: Wanna bet it's all from one uselessly exponential line of matchmaking code that someone at Codingame wrote drunk in 2015.
 ZarthaxX: oh yes got into it when legend opened, first time i didnt have to fight for it&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: you are getting there too MSmits prob
 MSmits: starting to think I might yeah
 MSmits: have more improvement locally *I think*
 MSmits: hard to be sure
 _martynas: Tried 1v1'ing 1st gold player for fun: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555883236">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555883236</a>
 jacek: back. do submits work now?
 JasperV: no
 JasperV: 757 computing atm
 ZarthaxX: thats not a sign of improvement necessary MSmits
 Pick8chu: Guys
 Pick8chu: What is your seeding weight algorithm? I seem to make bad choices finding a better spot to seed
 ItsNotABug: 762, exclusively going up
 Pick8chu: btw how do you know how many computing?
 ItsNotABug: leaderboard -&gt; score -&gt; computing
 ZarthaxX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2021/leaderboard/global?column=SCORE&amp;value=INPROGRESS</a>
 ItsNotABug: 774 now
 ZarthaxX: well, we can already call it gg and gz the top 3 right?
 aniski: technically, it happened during all the recent contests, didn't it?
 Pick8chu: first time so idk
 ZarthaxX: hey ToshiTuringMachine!!!
 Pick8chu: it seems pretty bad tho, I submitted mine like hours ago and still less then 30
 ntroPi: I have a consistent timeout ... but it goes away if I add some error output?I hate Heisenbugs.
 aniski: I submitted mine 5 hours ago, 32%
 ItsNotABug: Yeah. At least the last 4 
 Numby: GUYS
 Numby: I found why all my sims end the same
 Numby: I forgot to undo my trees as dormant at the end of each day -_-
 Pick8chu: How am i supposed to know which algorithm is better if I can't see the result :joy:
 Pick8chu: wdym?
 Pick8chu: you can undo your trees?
 ZarthaxX: he meant in his sim
 ZarthaxX: he didnt reset their state
 Pick8chu: what is 'sim'
 ZarthaxX: simulator
 ZarthaxX: you implement a simulator of the game in your code, t
 ZarthaxX: to use it for trying possible actions and
 ZarthaxX: keeping the best
 Pick8chu: wait 
 Pick8chu: how do you mean that you implement a simulator of a game in your code?
 Pick8chu: your code is just to get out the best possible actions atm isn't it?
 ntroPi: yes but to know what rally is the best we simulate the game
 ntroPi: really
 Pick8chu: how can you simulate the game? 
 Pick8chu: so you meant, to get the best possible action, every turns, you try every actions and see what's the best and choose that?
 Pick8chu: So basically every turns you would estimate possible scores when you reach the end? is that possible?
 ntroPi: no basically for every possible turn, simulate how the game would play out (assuming only simple moves until the end)
 MSmits: You need a way to look at the current game state and give it a score that tells you how good this is for you
 MSmits: then the simplest way to use a sim is to try each action
 MSmits: then calculate the new gamestate
 MSmits: evaluate it (give it a score)
 MSmits: take the highest scoring one
 Pick8chu: that's crazy that you can do that
 ZarthaxX: are you beaming smito?
 ZarthaxX: i got another game!
 MSmits: this is not a very effective way to do things in this contest. for this contest you need more depth (more turns ahead)
 MSmits: yes beaming
 MSmits: I am brutaltesting parameters. Found some good improvement i think
 ZarthaxX: nice
 ZarthaxX: need to set up that some day
 MSmits: normally i dont have a lot of succes with it
 MSmits: i tend to pick my parameters well enough that any improvement comes down to overtraining that doesnt translate to leaderboard
 MSmits: this time i did not pick them that well
 Pick8chu: Could you explain little bit of how you could do 'You need a way to look at the current game state and give it a score that tells you how good this is for you'
 Pick8chu: cause right now what i'm doing is
 MSmits: you can count the number of trees you have of each size
 MSmits: count the number of suns
 MSmits: game score
 Pick8chu: oh
 MSmits: the way your trees are shading eachother
 MSmits: the future income
 Pick8chu: so like calculate the weight of it
 MSmits: yes
 cegprakash: fn getScore { return player[me].score + player[me].sunpoints/3 } Pick8chu
 ddreams: kind of how you'd evaluate the board if were playing yourself
 MSmits: if you know chess, then the best example for you is the simple material score that is used
 MSmits: pawn 1 pt, knight 3pt etc.
 Pick8chu: but to see if it actually is making a progress, you gotta submit a lot of time right?
 MSmits: not sure what you mean by submitting time
 ddreams: no, you can play in the IDE or use brutaltester
 Pick8chu: brutaltester
 Pick8chu: is that a program?
 MSmits: Pick8chu if you are in a lower league, you should not worry about brutaltester
 MSmits: just try different things in your bot that make sense to you
 Pick8chu: I'm on gold league rn
 MSmits: ok, then you might have to worry about it&#160;:)
 Pick8chu: 400 something, i wanna be in the legend
 ddreams: what have you done so far?
 MSmits: well it's a bit late to actually write a sim and search if you have not done that before
 ddreams: sounds like we're talking with you as if you were in bronze
 Pick8chu: I was doing weighting but to see what i changed actually made it better, I had to submit everytime and see if my rank got up
 Pick8chu: Haha sorry bear with me, I just started this
 MSmits: currently it's impossible to do that
 MSmits: better test vs yourself locally
 Pick8chu: And I really appreciate your help
 MSmits: brutaltester is used for that
 Pick8chu: okay, i'll google brutaltester 
 Trottel-Nit: Just pick games from Last Battles that you lost, push them to IDE and check if your new version would win them.
 MSmits: yeah, someone else might be better at explaining what to do
 ddreams: you can download the game code and run it yourself, and brutaltester automatically runs it over and over for you
 MSmits: i always need people to explain it to me also :P
 Pick8chu: you guys are really nice, thanks a lot
 MSmits: Trottel-Nit thats a bit hard when the opponent uses randomness
 MSmits: or when you do
 Pick8chu: Yeah, i felt that too
 Pick8chu: with one guy i thought i made a good progress but
 MSmits: or even if they use the full calculation time and their search terminates at a different point
 Pick8chu: if I submitted it, it wasn't liking
 TobiasA: after the contest you guys have to teach me what you are talking about
 ddreams: my bot is random only in how much CPU cg is giving it
 MSmits: stick around and do multiplayer arenas guys
 MSmits: a lot of them are fun
 ddreams: I wish I had time to do more contests
 ddreams: last time I tryharded was in 2016 or so
 Pick8chu: ddream why not?
 Trottel-Nit: Yeah, thats right but at least it gives a hint and is much faster than submitting every time. And with brutaltester you can only play against your own bots, can't you?
 Pick8chu: are you busy&#160;?
 ddreams: work and family
 CouscousAgha: my motivation is slowly disappearing because of this&#160;:/
 MSmits: Trottel-Nit yes thats true
 Pick8chu: ah. good for you then
 ddreams: became a father last year
 MSmits: unless someone shares a compiled bot with you. I dont recommend that
 Pick8chu: Wow
 Pick8chu: congrats man!
 MSmits: gj
 Pick8chu: how is it being a father! you must be so happy
 ddreams: hehe, it's very fun
 ddreams: many people say the first months are so boring, but that's not my experience
 ddreams: like "all they do is eat and sleep"
 MSmits: I thought it was pretty boring :P
 Trottel-Nit: boring? Who the hell said THAT?&#160;:-)
 ddreams: but they are communicating quite early
 ddreams: MSmits right now :D
 Trottel-Nit: I loved the first weeks and months. Never felt so much love&#160;:-)
 MSmits: my daughter is 14 :P
 Pick8chu: wow
 MSmits: so i've been there
 TobiasA: must be nice
 Pick8chu: I never imagine having kids haha
 Pick8chu: Maybe I should start thinking, must be good
 ddreams: how old are you tho?
 MSmits: it's ok, I always wanted 0 or 1 child, since my wife wanted 1 or 2, there was overlap
 Pick8chu: I'm 26 international age
 ddreams: and your national age?
 ProG_r_aM_m_er: just gotta beat silver, i can do this lol
 MSmits: wait what is international age
 Pick8chu: I think I would want to have 1 girl and 1 boy
 actualCoderTrevor: metric age?
 Pick8chu: lol
 Pick8chu: so i'm from korea
 Pick8chu: and in korea, when you were born you are 1 yo
 MSmits: oh ok so not an alien from another solar system with different size of year
 Trottel-Nit: crazy
 Pick8chu: and you get older every new years
 Pick8chu: lmao
 Pick8chu: no i wish
 MSmits: well it's more accurate
 ddreams: lua must have been made by a Korean
 MSmits: you're 9 months old when you're born
 MSmits: so 1 is more accurante
 MSmits: accurate
 actualCoderTrevor: ddreams lol I get it
 Pick8chu: I think either china or korea
 Trottel-Nit: Never thought about that there could be different ways of counting your age ... interesting.
 Pick8chu: that's fair, yeah true MSmits
 Trottel-Nit: So, do you celebrate birthdays? Or is it all together on new year?
 Pick8chu: we do celebrate our own birthday
 Trottel-Nit: just not getting older ...?
 Pick8chu: but we all celebrate it on new years too, 
 Pick8chu: now you said it, it does make sense
 TobiasA: wow that's cool
 TobiasA: imagine everyone having the same birthday
 MSmits: reasons to celebrate don't have to make sense&#160;:)
 Trottel-Nit: Solved the birthday paradoxon
 Pick8chu: lol haha
 Pick8chu: okay i'm gonna try to download that brutal something
 jacek: introduction to algebra?
 Numby: What are people using as their timeout (ms) limit? Dunno if my code has too high of a variance on time taken for an iteration but it frequently times out even at 60ms limit&#160;:( I start timer after reading first input
 somnek: xqcL
 ddreams: timeout can also mean crash
 Marchete: only 18hours to pass smits
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 Pick8chu: it says '&lt;path_to_maven&gt;/mvn package', what should i type?
 DomiKo: mvn package
 ddreams: if you're in the brutaltester directory and have maven installed, just mvn package
 Pick8chu: okay trying
 Pick8chu: Oh working! thanks lol
 ddreams: then you get the jar file in the target directory
 ddreams: now you have to get the game, aka. referee
 struct: Whats gold boss current rating?
 ddreams: 50.27
 ddreams: Pick8chu <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 ZarthaxX: you can check on any replay struct
 ddreams: 807 computing now
 Pick8chu: actually the build had failed
 Pick8chu:  No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?
 Pick8chu: hmm
 ddreams: you need java8
 Pick8chu: yeah i thought i jsut downloaded it
 ddreams: newer javas give you problems
 Pick8chu: Oh
 Pick8chu: jdk-8u291-windows-x64.exe
 Pick8chu: i got this one, is this seems okay?
 ddreams: looks ok to me, I used chocolatey
 ddreams: choco install ojdkbuild8
 Pick8chu: I'm learning so many things today lol
 Pick8chu: I found i have jdk1.8.0_291
 Cjx_1: so disheartened by these submits &lt;/3
 ddreams: yeah... sucks
 HDainester: hey is it still possible to rank up fro wood to higher leagues? A friend of mine is now in there for quite a it, winning every game, but he doesn't rank up (stuck at rank 24).
 struct: submits are extremely slow atm
 ddreams: HDainester not really at the moment
 ddreams: practically broken
 Numby: How slow is extremely slow
 Cjx_1: normally to beat the bot per league (and thus level) it requires top 1-3
 Astrobytes: Overloaded server. 
 Numby: like hours? :O
 Cjx_1: ask them to check the leaderboards if their above that boss
 ddreams: played 45 battles in 5 hours
 HDainester: is there a chance this will be fixed in time?
 Astrobytes: Currently no indication as to when (or if) it will be fixed.
 Cjx_1: yeah, submits literally not going rn. Hours for just a handful of battles
 HDainester: ok thx all
 ddreams: 30% in 5 hours... so 15 hours for perhaps levelling up
 Cjx_1: although--wait a sec
 Cjx_1: i just had a big group of battles go
 actualCoderTrevor: The first ten seem to be in parallel but after that it will crawl
 Cjx_1: meh--seems like false hope
 Cjx_1: yeah ^^^^^
 Cjx_1: prolly ment as a buffer
 ddreams: the number of people waiting for scores is just increasing
 ddreams: 816 now
 Pick8chu: definitely not asians, it's 1am here
 Pick8chu: okay just build successfully
 ddreams: probably a lot of asians in the queue then, since it's been like this for over 8 hours at least
 Cjx_1: cries in tryhard
 Astrobytes: Well. I'll come back later and check on this. I'm off to watch some paint dry instead.
 Pick8chu: that's fair deduction haha
 Pick8chu: How can i make refree .zip as .jar?
 ddreams: mvn package makes a jar
 CogitoErgoProxy: does this platform have troubles with stream api of java? it says that i've not read all the input (i use the stream after the standard code)
 Marchete: in the eval, how can you control the COMPLETE part? I understand it's on endgame (day &gt;15 , malus when more than Nx tree3), but what other way to control that? 
 ddreams: what makes you keep trees around?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if the diff in score is &gt; nutrient value maybe
 Cjx_1: i just go off differnece in total trees lol
 Marchete: trees generate sun
 Marchete: sun is the economy on the game
 Marchete: trees3 generate score
 Marchete: score is the final objective
 Cjx_1: right on. Thats why even though its a super simple metric, if one has more trees than the opponent, shadows not considered, theyll be generateing mor sp
 Pick8chu: how do you play your js code on brutaltester?
 Pick8chu: i did 'js mycode.js'
 UndercoverToad: rip codejam dreams :sob:
 DomiKo: yeah
 CouscousAgha: is it done?
 DomiKo: we should do C2&#160;:/ 
 jacek:&#160;?
 UndercoverToad: domi and me both 56 points
 UndercoverToad: i thought that would be enough
 DomiKo: D1 matching euler?
 DomiKo: me too
 UndercoverToad: D1 random search
 DomiKo: lul
 UndercoverToad: just in a loop, for 300ms
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits congrats
 UndercoverToad: i think i could have done D1 is a similar manner even (quick look at the analysis)
 MSmits: ohh i am above boss
 MSmits: but not certain, submit needs to finish
 Cjx_1: grats &lt;3
 MSmits: lots of wins vs boss though
 Smelty: u in legend now?
 Smelty: :0
 MSmits: 5-1 vs boss
 MSmits: maybe tomorrow smelty
 Smelty: wow
 Pick8chu: good job!
 MSmits: at the speed this is going
 Smelty: i see that ur first in my league
 Smelty: and IM 1258 in my league
 Smelty: ....being the noob that i am
 MSmits: I guess UndercoverToad was right
 MSmits: thanks for your confidence again&#160;:)
 Smelty: oo.o
 ZarthaxX: smashing it smito
 ZarthaxX: gz!
 MSmits: I have a new version ready to go with 65% wr vs my old one too
 ZarthaxX: sheez
 MSmits: if that means anything
 MSmits: it migth be overfitting, who knows
 Marchete: submit it again ezpz
 TheBatMan_TM: hey can someone help me with this?
 TheBatMan_TM: I am back with a web app doubt
 ZarthaxX: are all those just optimized params?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: i hadnt fitted anything before
 ZarthaxX: damn
 TheBatMan_TM: but last time somebody helped me, so i am trying again
 ZarthaxX: didt change any term?
 ZarthaxX: wow
 MSmits: not really no, not in a while
 Marchete: how do you adjust weights then Smits?
 TheBatMan_TM: source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://replit.com/@kaushikkalesh/Online-Notes">https://replit.com/@kaushikkalesh/Online-Notes</a>
 ZarthaxX: wow
 Smelty: i invested everything into knight moves and now my ai sucks
 MSmits: currently i do it like this. Say I suspect a good value is between 0 and 400
 TheBatMan_TM: can someone tell me why my delete_note() isn't working?
 Smelty: hmm
 Marchete: like x*costs+y*sungain+z*positionalscoring
 MSmits: i create bot 0, 100, 200, 300, 400
 TheBatMan_TM: i think the problem is in index.js
 MSmits: have them all fight
 Smelty: k
 MSmits: 10 battles x 400, so 4000 total
 MSmits: then add up the wrs for each version
 Smelty: huh
 Smelty: Msmits ur over a point above the boss i'm confident in you promoting
 Marchete: I don't have a suspect of what my x,y,z could be
 MSmits: yeah seems likely now
 Marchete: I was doing unit tests
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'll celebrate my small victories.&#160;:(
 Marchete: like "test seeding"
 Marchete: and it's seeding correctly
 MSmits: what do you mean test seeding?
 Smelty: yay  won 2 out of first 10 battles....:(
 MSmits: oh
 Cjx_1: you have to patrick :D
 Marchete: scoring seed position
 Marchete: from all free positions, check score
 MSmits: ah ok, well i have two params that do somethign with seed score
 Smelty: yes
 Pick8chu: I kept getting 'Negative score during game 5 p0:-1' this error
 Pick8chu: does anyone knows?
 MSmits: well shadows mostly
 Smelty: ._.
 Smelty: Pick8chu what lang
 Marchete: I have N weights for that :D
 Cjx_1: pika, thats an invalid oputput deal i think
 Pick8chu: js
 Pick8chu: js ..
 MSmits: generally, you pick 1 param you keep fixed (I keep my score param at 1000)
 Smelty: well...javascript..hmm
 Marchete: sungain now + sungainfuture+etc etc
 MSmits: and then you try to fit the others relative to that
 Pick8chu: but i used exactly the same code that i used in IDE
 MSmits: you can do some easy calc to see what a realistic range would be
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 21st in my language...rofl
 Smelty: try going past condition only if &gt;-1
 MSmits: you wouldnt want suns to be more valuable than score for example
 Cjx_1: you doing anything in parralell?
 actualCoderTrevor: Pick8chu is trying to get brutaltester to work - and so am I with similar results (python)
 MSmits: Cjx_1 how do you mean?
 Pick8chu: Oh hey haha
 actualCoderTrevor: I've been lurking to see if someone helps you / if I can figure it out first
 actualCoderTrevor: In my case (and maybe yours) it seems like the referee isn't outputting anything
 Pick8chu: well mine too it kept saying 0%
 Pick8chu: but i guess that's just cause i'm returning -1
 Marchete: I usually just MC the weights until I hit jackpot :D
 natofp: you guys can just run the referee with inputs without brutaltester and see if that works
 DannyBoy1024: Does testing in arena also become super slow for you guys as well?
 Marchete: but I need to improve the search algo too...
 natofp: for me even this crashes input programs&#160;:))
 Marchete: too many things too little time
 Marchete: :S
 Cjx_1: yeah danny, its broke rn
 DannyBoy1024: oops....
 MSmits: yeah i still need to try a different search also
 MSmits: just to see if it works
 MSmits: should get to coding
 DannyBoy1024: I launched a test 4h ago and now it barely progressed 60%
 Michael_Howard: Greatest feeling ever: finding the awful bug that's messing your whole bot the day *before* the contest finishes.
 MSmits: then it;s getting beter
 MSmits: better
 MSmits: 4h 60%  i mean
 actualCoderTrevor: natofp I did try that using the command brutaltester gives me for "playback". Well it tell me the command should end with -d but the referee says it needs an option for that or something and I didn't provide one
 Cjx_1: folks looking at full shadow lengths or just immedietely adjacent places, or disregarding them? Im yet only looking at adjacent squares only lol
 MSmits: I look at full shadows
 MSmits: for big trees thats important
 Numby: where do I spend 95% of my time during sim? create a list of possible actions&#160;:(
 MSmits: i dont create lists during sim
 Marchete: I do a sun gain calculation Smits
 MSmits: me too Marchete
 Marchete: for all 6 days
 Marchete: I add some decay
 MSmits: for full game here
 Step_Bro: Nut
 Numby: how do you store the possible actions
 Cjx_1: smart, I homebrewed too much and now I dont wanna go back and rewrite the amount Id have to to easily get full shadows lolI prly will have to today tho lol
 Marchete: I have that too
 MSmits: I haven't added decay
 Marchete: but with a low weight
 Marchete: I'm not sure about endgame sungain
 Cjx_1: numby, theyre stored for us if you start with one of the templates--in numerical order of the cell as well\
 MSmits: me neither
 Step_Bro: Thicc nut
 Pick8chu: Oh i got the same thing -d
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits u definitely did something...yesterday u were avg. beating me by 10 pts, now you are around 28 ... and i did change some stuff for the better on my end
 MSmits: not sure about a lot of things
 Marchete: I calc sungain current + expected growth+expected growth2+engame sun
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII yes fitting parameters better
 actualCoderTrevor: If I just copy-paste a bunch of text here it will automatically make a paste link right?
 Marchete: I don't check "neighbours" or shadows
 Marchete: but sungain futue
 Marchete: future
 Numby: I mean when simulating a game and at a certain state you first have to find what are the possible actions. and there's a number of them so need to store them in some list right?
 MSmits: but if you do future sun gain you do shadows too
 Marchete: it's faster for me too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Marchete where r u on leaderboard?
 Marchete: I mean not just shadow
 MSmits: btw future sungain might not properly take into account seed positioning
 actualCoderTrevor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ca439c3-13fa-440a-96dc-4c6838762909">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ca439c3-13fa-440a-96dc-4c6838762909</a>
 Marchete: ofc
 MSmits: it takes many turns for a seed to give enough income for it to matter where it is placed
 kovi: speedup on servers!
 Marchete: but I don't get any better idea
 Marchete: I'm like 3000th PatrickMcGinnisII :D
 MSmits: tbh, all i have is a bunch of features that made sense on some level, i gave them a param (obviously a wrong one at first) and am fitting them today
 actualCoderTrevor: And the link it gives me looks like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/JRZLorn">https://imgur.com/JRZLorn</a> any ideas?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm still lurking aroun 1.1k overall
 DaNinja: java -jar cg-brutaltester-1.0.0.jar -r "java -jar -Dleague.level=3 -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" -p1 "../x64/Release/Spring2021-ai1.exe" -p2 "../x64/Release/Spring2021.exe" -t 2 -n 30 -l "./logs/"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Marchete, u at 1471...smh
 DaNinja: works for me
 actualCoderTrevor: Thanks I'll try that!
 Marchete: it's the referee.jar published somewhere?
 Marchete: spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
 Marchete: I know maven and sh*t
 Nerchio: guys what do you think about search ignoring complete and doing just economy,
 Marchete: no
 Nerchio: i feel like completes need to account for enemy so they are kinda useless in a solo-search
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, my echo dot just went off, who is phishing my network?
 Nerchio: i override almost all completes of my search anyway
 Marchete: I don't know :D
 Marchete: don't generate completes until endgame
 Marchete: problem solved
 Marchete: or trees3 &gt; 4 or 5
 Nerchio: yeah kinda makes me wanna try ignoring completes in search tbh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't cut unless tree3 is &gt;3 no matter the running score
 Marchete: directly don't generate the moves
 Marchete: in early game
 Nerchio: if only submits were working
 MSmits: they're a little better now
 MSmits: but might still be very slow
 MSmits: dont all submit at once now&#160;:)
 Nerchio: yeah i'll wait
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think it's been an hour for 30%
 Scarfield: since the cost of completing is more expensive the more trees of that size you have, there should be an optimum of when to start thinking about completing i guess. could try limiting it, instead of completely disregarding it(?)
 Nerchio: my point is that eval is hard
 Cjx_1: thats a very hard tipping point to figuer out I think
 Nerchio: when to sell trees and when not
 Nerchio: so search can pick suboptimally because it tries to sell
 Nerchio: if you rule out completes you can have much easier eval focusing on economy
 Cjx_1: honestly, I think its likely better to just use the opponents score and your trees as metrics for complete, but my endgame still sucks to be fair lol
 MSmits: Scarfield it's a hard one to optimize, the opponent also enters into this. If he starts eating neutrients....
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i figured out that if the cost of growing a tree3 is &gt;10 then it's not economic
 MSmits: it helps to hard-prune some things like, dont complete trees when you have few of them halfway through the game. Not because your search cant find it, but because it lightens the load on the search
 MSmits: with beamsearch that means less states to beam
 Pick8chu: could anyone help me to set up brutaltester?
 Scarfield: yes of course, but a bad estimate of it, might still be better than removing complete from search entirely(?)
 Pick8chu: it just kept saying i got negative score
 MSmits: time outs
 MSmits: i think
 MSmits: your bot is crashing somehow
 Pick8chu: 02:00:35,347 ERROR [com.magusgeek.brutaltester.GameThread] Negative score during game 3 p0:-102:00:35,347 ERROR [com.magusgeek.brutaltester.GameThread] Negative score during game 3 p1:-1
 MSmits: this is my usage:
 MSmits: java -jar .\cg-brutaltester-1.0.0.jar -r "java -jar Referee.jar" -p1 "./0" -p2 "./20" -t 8 -n 400
 Pick8chu: which language do you use?
 MSmits: bots are called 0.exe and 20.exe
 Pick8chu: I see
 MSmits: that doesnt matter, these bots are executables, compiled
 MSmits: not sure how this would work with a non-compiled language
 DaNinja: nice to have 8 threads!&#160;:)
 Pick8chu: I uses js and it maybe cause of how i conpiled it
 MSmits: yes that helps DaNinja, but i had to stop my yavalath solver&#160;:(
 Scarfield: 824 results found for «Score - Computing»&#160;:'(
 UndercoverToad: this morning when it start to get slow, there were 100 in submit
 MSmits: yeah they fixed something at least, submits are moving
 MSmits: just very slow
 dbdr: you're still running it MSmits? :o
 MSmits: yep
 dbdr: wow
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: me and 3 others above boss
 MSmits: oh you mean yavalath solver?
 dbdr: yeah
 CouscousAgha: oh i think it's fixed now
 MSmits: yeah, i restarted it later, it's now parallelized. I restarted because I polluted it with counterbooking
 MSmits: want to run solver without interference
 MSmits: two starting moves will solve automatically, but i still wonder if any of the other ones can be solved
 MSmits: academic interest mostly&#160;:)
 dbdr: awesome!
 UndercoverToad: others call it obsession
 UndercoverToad: but i'm impressed by it
 MSmits: those are not mutually exclusive
 MSmits: obsession is often amazing :P
 MSmits: thanks UndercoverToad and you were right, i got there in the end
 MSmits: still some ways to go but +2 pts should do it
 UndercoverToad: i also predicted that you will rank above me
 MSmits: yes you did and it's a possibility. Fitting params does a lot of good
 MSmits: but i cant say for sure
 UndercoverToad: i might run some offline batches tomorrow to hope for the best
 MSmits: it well not hurt at least
 UndercoverToad: except for overfitting maybe
 MSmits: I am liking the method of creating 5 bots and have them all fight
 UndercoverToad: did anyone get around the log file warnings for the brutaltester?
 MSmits: it reduces overfitting due to drift
 kovi: hmm, my code performs better when servers are ok
 MindController: Holy, 7 hours into submit and only 70% done
 kovi: 100%=#1
 UndercoverToad: it's reported but staff is on a long weekend
 DaNinja: I created a log directory, that fixed the errors
 UndercoverToad: i still hope that they'll do something about it soon. we just don't know more
 UndercoverToad: just a folder "log"?
 MSmits: so they just log back in on monday and go like: "So, what'd we miss?"
 DaNinja: yes
 dbdr: gg kovi
 UndercoverToad: anything else to consider? e.g. command line arg
 DaNinja: -l "./logs/"
 DaNinja: at the end
 UndercoverToad: i'll try

 MSmits: 1 more battle for renarrd
 MSmits: 49.83 &gt; boss 49.46
 UndercoverToad: ok, now just compiling the referee again with a setting other than info
 UndercoverToad: or replacing info in that xml
 UndercoverToad: no, the latter didn't do the trick
 Pick8chu: does anyone use js?
 Pick8chu: it gives me readline is not defined

 timbersson: put in src\main\resources\log4j2.xml
 ddreams: so battles are finally fixed
 ddreams: yay
 Cjx_1: if this arena ever finishes, I think I may be low 300's in silver, maybe even mid 200's. Im personally hella happy lol :DGoing for gold so hard lol
 struct: recurse submited :D
 struct: only saw now
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: lol
 ddreams: I have a better bot too, but don't want to submit it...
 ddreams: this one was beating msmits and he's numba one
 UndercoverToad: then reCurse might reach legend on Monday
 struct: lol
 reCurse: Yeah thanks to that stupid scare...
 reCurse: I choked
 UndercoverToad: losing matches in wood1 already? :P
 NinjaDoggy: lol
 reCurse: I seriously thought the problem wouldn't get fixed and even promoting to bronze before end would be a close call
 UndercoverToad: which was your alt? i would say probably someone from Japan
 reCurse: Anyway nothing to see move along
 UndercoverToad: wait, they did something to improve it now?
 reCurse: Yes
 struct: its better atm 
 UndercoverToad: nice
 ddreams: still scoring over 800, but I got from 30 to 60 in lunchtime 
 ddreams: so something has unjammed
 reCurse: Backlog will take a while to go through
 UndercoverToad: we know that from league opening back in the days of from CSB promotions
 reCurse: Thanks for fixing it CG but no thanks for the heart attack
 DomiKo: Toad don't beat me&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: then don't fight me
 jrke: recurse is that you - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/316314dc83b90a6bacf4438dc504e1940285672">https://www.codingame.com/profile/316314dc83b90a6bacf4438dc504e1940285672</a>
 ddreams: starting fights you can't win isn't a good idea
 UndercoverToad: you got me at codejam by a few ranks already. not that it would matter
 reCurse: Streaming account jrke
 reCurse: Had separate logins for everything when streaming
 reCurse: Super restricted HDD access etc
 UndercoverToad: not to accidentally leak anything?
 reCurse: Yeah
 UndercoverToad: wise decision, would do the same if i would be streaming
 reCurse: Also streaming on secondary monitor
 reCurse: So primary gets all the new crap
 UndercoverToad: then again i would be a horrible entertainer. no one would want to see me for more than 5 minutes
 reCurse: You're implying I wasn't
 UndercoverToad: didn't watch long enough to tell :innocent:
 reCurse: Don't blame you
 Cjx_1: if you tell me your wearing a toad outfit rn, id watch :P
 Astrobytes: I thought you were pretty good at it tbh
 MSmits: 5 mins is quite long. You could cover a song in that time UndercoverToad
 UndercoverToad: and get a twitch strike
 Cjx_1: maybe occassionall ribbits? Thatd be funny lol
 Astrobytes: haha
 Scarfield: you were streaming this contest reBless?
 jacek: stream this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHU2RlSCdxU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHU2RlSCdxU</a>
 reCurse: No a long time ago
 Cjx_1: a streamer HexTree_ did at least some streams of it in python
 Scarfield: ah okay, thought i missed something :p
 Scarfield: saw most of your locam videos on youtube before i started learning c++, probably worth having a 2nd look&#160;:)
 reCurse: Nooo
 struct: time to put it down :D
 Cjx_1: F, now IM watching hypnotoad for 10 hrs....&lt;/3
 reCurse: The only reason I don't is because I mostly forget about them
 ddreams: wonder if the game would be less asymmetrical if the starting trees were diagonally opposite
 PatrickMcGinnisII: U guys need a life ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD
 Cjx_1: PRAISE TO THE TOAD
 pszemsza: is the Spring Challenge going to be available later in Bot Programming?
 reCurse: Yes
 pszemsza: cool, thanks!
 struct: I wonder if pb 4 is still playing 
 ddreams: if they
 ddreams: if they're not in the chat room, can they get pings?
 reCurse: Only if they log in before history gets erased
 struct: no
 ddreams: no tab completion on pb
 dbdr: lol, opp stops playing because he thinks he won, but...<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555964133">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555964133</a>
 kovi: wow
 ddreams: lol, nice
 Pick8chu: does anyone know how to compile javascript into exe?
 Scarfield: xD
 Pick8chu: i used node pkg but apprantly readline is not defined
 ddreams: no, but you shouldn't need to
 kovi: i think its because he detect and support another rust bot
 Pick8chu: wdym?
 Alonius: Are there any changes in game rules in gold and legend leagues?
 ddreams: you're trying to play locally, right?
 Pick8chu: java -jar cg-brutaltester-1.0.0.jar -r "java -jar spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" -p1 "js myCode.js" -p2 "js myCode.js" -t 2 -n 1000 -l "./logs/"
 Pick8chu: yes i tried this
 ddreams: what's js though? node?
 Pick8chu: js myCode.js doesn't work so i thought 
 Pick8chu: yes i guess
 ddreams: uhm
 Scarfield: no Alonius, rules stay the same from bronze
 ddreams: try writing node myCode.js instead
 ddreams: haven't tried node on windows, but that's what I'd do elsewhere
 Pick8chu: i just did and Negative score during game 1 p1:-1
 Pick8chu: it seemed work tho
 Pick8chu: time.��RED��Player 0 was disqualified.��RED��Player 1 has not provided an action in time.��RED��Player 1 was disqualified.
 Pick8chu: wait, is this timeout errors?
 Lysk: probably yes
 nikita_lutsuk: \
 Pick8chu: Why tho? the same code would work fine in IDE
 Pick8chu: it does work
 Pick8chu: ...hmmmmmmmm
 KelvinAndHubbles: tf the silver boss is in 29th place
 KelvinAndHubbles: submits must be reallly slow
 ddreams: Pick8chu probably playing in wood league
 TobiasA: is the boss supposed to be higher lower?
 TobiasA: silver boss that is
 Pick8chu: @ddreams like go back and play there?
 KelvinAndHubbles: well, I mean considering who ever beats it gets promoted, yeah
 Scarfield: there are submits from 12.00 ish, they have been stuck for loong, but its starting to help.
 KelvinAndHubbles: it's just theres about 30 submits currently beating it that hasn't finished
 tobk: my submit from ~9h ago finished just now...
 ddreams: Pick8chu no, the default league when playing locally is wood leage
 ddreams: *league
 Pick8chu: oh
 Pick8chu: but I tried with the starter Kit 
 ddreams: so you have to write, I think, -D league.level=3
 Pick8chu: like the basic
 ddreams: oh
 Pick8chu: there's no way it would give me a timeout.. but I should try that too
 ddreams: ok, well, if you add "-s" to your options, you'll get a web server where you can inspect the output
 Pick8chu: I think the problem is
 Pick8chu: javascript doesn't have a funcion called readline
 reCurse: It's hacked in by CG
 Pick8chu: but somehow on codingame they use it to get inputs
 BlitzProg: The more I try to fix my heuristic, the less I understand it. How am I even supposed to play
 reCurse: Someone posted an implementation a long time ago
 Pick8chu: oh they did?
 Pick8chu: where?
 Pick8chu: like community on CG?
 reCurse: Forgot sorry
 Astrobytes: May have been the discord. Though it might have been pasted in the forum somewhere too.
 Lysk: -s is for swap, do you mean -l "./logs"
 UndercoverToad: it was discord
 Lysk: oops
 Scarfield: DiscoBytes
 Pick8chu: there's one on french but i have no idea lol
 ddreams: Lysk that's in brutaltester, if you run the referee by itself it starts a server like an IDE playout

 Pick8chu: OHHHHHHHHHHHHH
 Pick8chu: THANKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
 Astrobytes: ffs toad
 Lysk: oh, got it, ddreams (thanks for the help thes other day for cin.good() by the way&#160;:) )
 Pick8chu: ah.
 Pick8chu: still doesn't work...
 UndercoverToad: did you find it too Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: Yes!
 Pick8chu: fd = fs.openSync('/dev/stdin', 'rs')
 UndercoverToad: in the Ocean of Code thread. That will be deleted at some point
 Pick8chu: this doesn't exist
 UndercoverToad: i still don't get why some channels disappeared. can't you just make them read-only?
 Astrobytes: Clutter?
 UndercoverToad: fountains of knowledge
 Cjx_1: ok I got it. I just need to redesign game.board I think. This will work, and be worth the time. (he said without much belief in the words lol)
 Astrobytes: Who am I to question 
 Scarfield: Submit count dropping 729 results found for «Score - Computing» 
 ddreams: Lysk yw&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: 724
 UndercoverToad: we are on the same page Scarfield
 Enknable: omw to gold!&#160;:)
 Cjx_1: gl &lt;3
 CouscousAgha: holy * the top 20 spots in gold is literally at war
 CouscousAgha: everyone are fighting for legend
 Scarfield: we were literally xD
 CouscousAgha: beautiful
 UndercoverToad: those are the legend bots stuck on slow submit
 Numby: Lol 3 people above boss now
 Cjx_1: I think all the way to silver will be quite heated for the rest. I cant imagine the savagry in platinum lol
 Scarfield: on the same page that is
 Numby: 4*
 Lysk: wow 363 submit in gold oO
 MSmits: damn i am dropping, very near boss now
 ZarthaxX: F
 Lysk: still a good margin above the boss score
 ZarthaxX: its a bit random
 ZarthaxX: you had a good streak smito&#160;:(
 MSmits: yeah
 UndercoverToad: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/555982654">https://www.codingame.com/replay/555982654</a>a new opening - and it's 1 sun better :o
 UndercoverToad: should check again with me upgrading the large tree later maybe
 UndercoverToad: my opening is poor
 ZarthaxX: hardcoded opening? :P
 DomiKo: why not use search instead of opening?
 UndercoverToad: i do
 UndercoverToad: but my search is bad
 DomiKo: yeah I beat you
 DomiKo: :stuck_out_tongue:
 Jelle: How to start the escape room game?
 nader5: how to learn on this website
 aangairbender: Jelle go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com">https://escape.codingame.com</a>
 Pick8chu: GG
 Jelle: Yes I started and got a number and a link
 Jelle: but then nothing happens
 ddreams: I think people say check your email
 Jelle: nothing in inbox
 ddreams: spam? though I have no idea really
 Jelle: Nope also not there, thanks for thinking along
 CouscousAgha: LOL TOP GOLD IS LITERALLY AT WAR 
 ddreams: I don't like that brutaltester is printing output ignoring draws
 CouscousAgha: are you guys witnessing this 
 Twelve0: and gold boss's score is increasing!  
 MSmits: oh come on!
 MSmits: 0.06 below boss now&#160;:(
 Scarfield: just resubmit
 MSmits: lol
 Scarfield: xD
 ddreams: lol
 CouscousAgha: i dont htink u need to resubmit if you are 0.2-0.1 below boss
 ddreams: I will resubmit soon
 CouscousAgha: one push from another player and you are promoted 
 ddreams: well, I'll wait the last 10% nwo
 Scarfield: you will get there im sure, if not now then just a little push
 MSmits: yeah i guess so, it's really annoying though, i have a better version offline
 MSmits: but if i submit it, it will take forever
 UndercoverToad: then submit and go to bed
 MSmits: not yet my napnap time
 ddreams: it's progressing at a good speed now
 ZarthaxX: ^
 Scarfield: oh, yea&#160;:/ looks like the submits are going faster and faster though
 dbdr: UndercoverToad still waiting for your morning submit? :D
 UndercoverToad: dealing with my codejam disappointment
 ddreams: oh, what happened?
 dbdr:&#160;:(
 UndercoverToad: took a short walk after and of course got the idea how to solve a problem
 ddreams: brains
 ZarthaxX:&#160;;(
 UndercoverToad: i needed top1000 and reached 1194. that's what happened
 struct: thats normal
 ddreams: ack, that sucks
 ClockSort: that's rough, sorry @UndercoverToad
 MSmits: that's why i dont like short contests.. I need walks to get ideas too
 MSmits: sucks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I walk to the fridge
 dbdr: I spent the whole day trying to make a more clever search work. I just realized I was using a stinky old eval that ignores the opponent :upside_down:
 UndercoverToad: i see you failed that round too ClockSort
 ClockSort: I got 2845th place, yeah
 MSmits: lol PatrickMcGinnisII
 UndercoverToad: robo at 2856
 ddreams: you care about the opponent now, dbdr?
 ddreams: :p
 ClockSort: I couldn't even solve Matrygons ... i was going for the biggest test set on it
 UndercoverToad: i solved small first and then returned for big
 UndercoverToad: but on C and D it remained small
 alchemsti: sorry to hear that UndercoverToad
 ClockSort: solving D small put me ahead of all the other small guys because it was 1pt more, haha
 UndercoverToad: i wrote a random solver and let it run 300 ms on each testcase, taking the best result as the answer
 alchemsti: Google's code Jam? Did you have a motivation other than a cool contest?
 ClockSort: it was a tough round, you needed to solve two of B, C, and D to qualify
 dbdr: ddreams I was trying to, if not for that bug
 UndercoverToad: i'm collecting tshirts, that was my main point of motivation
 ClockSort: :sweat_smile:
 reCurse: Wear them all at same time and aim for world record
 UndercoverToad: that could cause damage to them
 alchemsti: Ha! That's a good motivation, IMO
 dbf: UndercoverToad - if you have too many t-shirts, check this one: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RT69bnWgb3g/UsmkKfza4RI/AAAAAAAAfZY/GksJbTYqe4U/s1600/IMG_20131229_205945.jpg">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RT69bnWgb3g/UsmkKfza4RI/AAAAAAAAfZY/GksJbTYqe4U/s1600/IMG_20131229_205945.jpg</a>

 ClockSort: @UndercoverToad see above pastebin
 UndercoverToad: dbf that's horrible
 MSmits: submit fininished. 0.09 below boss
 MSmits: just needs 1 battle
 MSmits: damn a loss
 CouscousAgha: I got you MSmits
 dbf: UndercoverToad I think in this mode they will be save better than if you wear and wash them regulary&#160;:)
 ddreams: practically in legend then, MSmits
 Zenoscave: MSmits that's rough
 Zenoscave: are submits faster again?
 zasmu: me too, gonna kick the boss&#160;:)
 ddreams: yes Zenoscave
 MSmits: well I'll go take a break, I may get pushed over later
 ddreams: they're working well now
 Scarfield: not well id say, but definately better
 kovi: maybe just wait to be pushed (boss pulled) by pending submits
 Zenoscave: I feell asleep during my last submit
 ddreams: still have a huge backlog, but 300 are gone now
 ddreams: only five hundred-ish left from 820 or so
 Scarfield: i saw some submits that were 8 hours and counting :O
 Zenoscave: Last submit i did was 2... So it got worse
 ddreams: mine finished now after 7 hours, with like 70% the last hour
 UndercoverToad: dbf i'm also impressed by the number of different colors. All I get is black
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556006710">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556006710</a>
 Zenoscave: That's a copied bot, no?
 DomiKo: UndercoverToad  in Russia they like colors
 ClockSort: @UndercoverToad were you close on large C or D in the code jam?
 ddreams: copied from?
 UndercoverToad: i thought it wasn't even necessary
 actualCoderTrevor: Does anyone have the referee and/or brutaltester working with Python? It seems like the referee and my poor little script just aren't communicating. This is the closest I've been able to get: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/jedDOeK">https://imgur.com/jedDOeK</a>
 UndercoverToad: on C I realized that the last 1 represents the largest cake
 UndercoverToad: from there it's just 2 recursive calls of both sides
 UndercoverToad: and a binomial
 Zenoscave: Is CJ over!? I just woke up
 UndercoverToad: over
 Scarfield: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Scarfield:&#160;?
 Scarfield: poor zenos table im afraid
 TobiasA: i semi-hardcoded my bot to get from around 500th to 42th rank in bronze but it wasn't enough to defeat the boss and now i don't know what to do 
 ddreams: do you still seed next to your own trees?
 Zenoscave: The table has too much stuff on it otherwise...
 MSmits: aww screw this i am submitting my new bot :P
 Scarfield: gl
 dbf: UndercoverToad, raic-2020 could be black also&#160;:)
 TobiasA: yes 
 ddreams: I'm on the way to do the same
 Zenoscave: MSmits how much better is it?
 ddreams: TobiasA then figure out a way to avoid it
 ClockSort: @Zenoscave it's probably worse XD
 MSmits: locally 65-35
 MSmits: not sure otherwise
 ddreams: after how many matches?
 Zenoscave: After how many matches?
 MSmits: 4000
 Zenoscave: did you play benches?
 Zenoscave: or just your bot?
 TobiasA: i've been trying values for the score but it doesn't work
 Zenoscave: this game is very rps
 MSmits: i did 400 games per game with 5 different bots, each with a different param value
 MSmits: so i had them all play against eachother
 TobiasA: like to avoid seeding next to mine the tree size has to be greater than 1 but the bot doesn't know that
 MSmits: this one came ahead each time
 MSmits: and 65% vs old
 Zenoscave: Gotcha.
 ddreams: almost certainly better then
 MSmits: you would think so
 ddreams: that kind of local improvement has always given a big improvement in ranking for me
 MSmits: won all first 10 anyways, should speed things up
 MSmits: but gonna take a break ttyl, hope this submit makes it
 ddreams: for sure, gl though&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks
 actualCoderTrevor: ... If I compile the starter.cpp file, I can use that with the referee no problem. But the starter.py file is no good. I'm just launching it with "python starter.py" is that wrong? I have python 3.9.0.
 Enknable: what errors u get?
 UndercoverToad: open a terminal and try that command there
 actualCoderTrevor: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/KCeM0iL">https://imgur.com/a/KCeM0iL</a>
 UndercoverToad: windows: do you have python as a path variable?
 actualCoderTrevor: Yeah I'm able to launch the script from the command-line
 UndercoverToad: flush stdout
 UndercoverToad: print(command, flush=True)
 Enknable: "?RED?"
 actualCoderTrevor: Hmm okay I'll try that...
 ddreams: smart toad
 UndercoverToad: i literally have a tshirt that tells you to do that :rofl:

 SabertheLost: I win against bossoot 1 in 10 now. Still not good enougth. 
 ddreams: lol
 DomiKo: :joy:
 SabertheLost: I want to play agenst myself. (my ai vs myself)
 KelvinAndHubbles: you can, delete the other AI down at players options
 ddreams: I guess he means himself as human player
 SabertheLost: yeah&#160;:) 
 ddreams: not too hard to make it
 SabertheLost: I want see if my code is "smarter2
 actualCoderTrevor: Sadly the shirt didn't help&#160;:( Also I showed you the error for my own bot the starter.py is just slightly different but seems to be the same root cause: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/F6awU0h">https://imgur.com/F6awU0h</a>
 KelvinAndHubbles: ahh, well then just write this game as an actual game
 ddreams: need to disable timeouts in the referee, and make a program that asks you for the move
 Zenoscave: actualCoderTrevor what referee are you using...
 UndercoverToad: that looks like your bot has a problem actualCoderTrevor
 UndercoverToad: do you play with bronze rules?
 Zenoscave: If it's mine I don't send the action's
 actualCoderTrevor: UndercoverToad this is just the starter.py
 ddreams: actualCoderTrevor it has a stack trace there
 Zenoscave: which is why the index[0] would fail
 ddreams: aha
 actualCoderTrevor: Yes I was able to make it that far with "java -jar -Dleague.level=3 -Dlog4j.configurationFile=log4j2.xml spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
 ddreams: right, Zenoscave has removed that part of the output
 UndercoverToad: you don't send actions Zenoscave?
 UndercoverToad: how dare you?
 Zenoscave: For time reasons.
 ddreams: I saw that he removed it in a later commit
 ddreams: I still use an earlier version with the actions
 Zenoscave: I'll put a full version up
 Zenoscave: my bad
 actualCoderTrevor: wait... the -Dleague.level=3 isn't doing anything
 ddreams: nice way to remove the timeouts
 DaNinja: actualCoderTrevor how are you running the viewer?
 ddreams: I recompiled the entire codingame sdk
 DaNinja: this works for me
 DaNinja: java -jar ./target/spring-2021-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -p1 ../x64/Release/Spring2021-h1.exe -p2 ../x64/Release/Spring2021.exe -l .\logs/game4.json -s -d seed=1009211670800188956
 ddreams: DaNinja add "-s"
 actualCoderTrevor: ^
 UndercoverToad: he has -s
 actualCoderTrevor: DaNinja it works fine with compiled .exe's but not python scripts
 ddreams: UndercoverToad is  -Dleague.level=3  the right syntax?
 Zenoscave: It doesn't work if you don't generate your own actions. 
 UndercoverToad: the python starter to be precise
 UndercoverToad: yes ddreams
 DaNinja: actualCoderTrevor to get the graphics, copy all files in main\resources\view\assets\ to main\resources\view\assets\assets\ then recompile
 actualCoderTrevor: DaNinja thanks I'll try that in a bit. But I think it should work without them(?) I mean it seems to work with an .exe like I said.
 actualCoderTrevor: UndercoverToad to answer your earlier question, I see the same behavior with the version at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/dreignier/SpringChallenge2021</a> as well as <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021">https://github.com/LSmith-Zenoscave/SpringChallenge2021</a>
 ddreams: they have the same removal of output
 Zenoscave: I merged dreigniers changes into mine
 Zenoscave: It always sends a action count of 0
 Zenoscave: I'll probably undo that change but keep the rest
 actualCoderTrevor: Oh I see
 Magus: I changed that to make the referee faster :D
 actualCoderTrevor: So this is different from what the IDE is using?
 Magus: my code never used the possibleMoes
 Magus: *possibleMoves
 actualCoderTrevor: Yes the Python starter code definitely uses that
 actualCoderTrevor: (As does my script)
 Zenoscave: I figured Magus. I didn't think people would use mine so heavily before generating possible moves
 ddreams: is it you that made the brutaltester?
 ddreams: it's cool
 jacek: AutomatonNN where are you&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: jacek lol
 Magus: ddreams: Yes I created brutaltester. I'm not the only contributor, eulerscheZahl and some other codingamers made some pull request on it.
 ddreams: Nice of you to share
 Magus: I wanted to add a feature for the confidence interval in the statistics. But never find the time to code that.
 Zenoscave: Based on wilson's CI test?
 Zenoscave: I can add that soon if you want
 TobiasA: this is the coolest thing i have ever seen :sob:

 Zenoscave: try this one actualCoderTrevor
 Zenoscave: no need for -Dleague.level flag either

 DomiKo: jacek :thinking:
 DomiKo: that link looks familiar
 jacek: youtube is pretty popular site after all
 ddreams: QQ domiko
 dbdr: MSmits still the same submit?
 ddreams: he resubmitted
 dbdr: yes, I'm silly, just had a look at the submit time
 KelvinAndHubbles: submissions going faster yet?
 MSmits: this bot should be better, but not seeing that much evidence of it yet
 Zenoscave: jacek HA I have ads so it didn't work
 TobiasA: i knew it yet i still clicked
 dbdr: why? did not promote?
 Astrobytes: wait, your first one didn't make legend?
 MSmits: nope
 MSmits: got stuck -0.2
 Zenoscave: I still listened anyways. I like this song
 dbdr: ouch
 ddreams: I was sure mine would make it too, since it seemed to beat msmit so much
 MSmits: could have waited, but i need to test my new param values
 MSmits: and supposedly it has 65% so..
 Astrobytes: fair 
 UndercoverToad: vs yourself where every tiny change has effects
 dbdr: did you read the stats right?&#160;;)
 MSmits: yes i know UndercoverToad
 dbdr: or is it 35%?&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's a risk, but i still have the old code. Can just resubmit
 MSmits: lol no, i looked right this time&#160;:)
 MSmits: going afk a bit, dont want to watch this, too stressful :P
 ddreams: you use swapped position while testing, I hope
 dbdr: we'll look for you
 dbdr: and you'll make it
 dbdr: I had a long day, lots of frustration. but what an illumination. happy I found it and did not stay in hte mystery of why it barely works
 TobiasA: damn rick astley got moves tho
 UndercoverToad: did you submit a working version of it already dbdr?
 dbdr: yep, it's in&#160;:)
 ddreams: are you also considering the opponent now euler?
 UndercoverToad: no&#160;:/
 jacek: selfish
 UndercoverToad: tried, was on par at best
 CameronWatt: Lol =+&#160;!= += how did i do this
 actualCoderTrevor: Zenoscave thanks that gets me a lot farther but I still get a weird "?RED?Player 1 has not provided an action in time.?RED?" on round 56 with my own script. I gotta go for a few minutes but wanted to let you know I tried it. It's definitely an improvement.
 Zenoscave: It means ou timed out
 Zenoscave: that's on you
 ddreams: or you crashed
 Numby: I think my code's timing out on garbage collect. When running it locally it can go to 1GB~4GB memory lol
 VizGhar: wow o.O
 Numby: Like each turn is consistently taking 65ms then I just time out
 jacek: your code is garbage eg
 ddreams: you have a max of 700mb ram, so perhaps it's killed
 CouscousAgha: boss is at 49.63
 CouscousAgha: :D
 aCat: Nomby in what language you write?
 aCat: Numby
 aCat: you can prealocate memory and use factories
 aCat: or sometimes even turn GC off
 Numby: In java, I think my search tree is gobbing up memory. I've been re-rooting my tree if opponent selected a turn that's in the tree
 Numby: So I can keep a part of the search tree that's relevant but I guess eventually the parent portion of the tree gets GCed and I time out
 Numby: At least that's my theory...
 Illedan: :wave:
 Astrobytes: hey Ille
 ddreams: Hei Ille
 UndercoverToad: did you sleep since yesterday Illedan?
 Illedan: Didn't do anything on this
 Illedan: But I'll start now
 Illedan: Tomorrow I don't have to wake up at 7
 Enknable: Numby I think you wanna preallocate (pool) your states at the beginning. Then just keep track of which state are in the current tree
 dbdr: gogogo Illedan
 Illedan: I have a wierd idea. Wanna see if it pays out&#160;:)
 UndercoverToad: no, C#C#C#
 dbdr: cheese?
 Zenoscave: rust
 Illedan: I tried to fill the board with seeds. Didn't help too much
 UndercoverToad: weird, not wierd. every single time you do this&#160;;)
 Illedan: I need a full rewrite
 Illedan: Yeah that word is weird
 dbdr: I thought about it, but must be too slow/expensive
 CameronWatt: hehe
 Illedan: Fun though, enemy had no good actions in the last 3 rounds 
 Illedan: xD
 dbdr: game is well balanced, that's why it's hard to eval
 CameronWatt: hrmmmmm
 dbdr: got a replay Illedan?
 Illedan: I guess you can do it on highly blocked maps?
 Illedan: nope
 dbdr: possibly, yeah
 kovi: but how can you afford it
 struct: arent seeds a bit expensive for that?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556057454">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556057454</a>
 Scarfield: shadows galore
 actualCoderTrevor: Zenoscave yeah it seems spamming stderr is a lot more costly on my local machine than in the IDE. I removed the spam and now I was able to see a game to completion. \o/ Thank you so much!!! p.s. I finally realized ?RED? is just so the IDE makes the text red, lol.
 Zenoscave: stderr is very costly
 Illedan: Anyway, off to code something working. No sleep until euler beaten :nerd:

 actualCoderTrevor: lol
 Nezinau: Hey, could you give me a hint what to think about in pod racing (coders strike back) when you get to pods colliding stage?
 reCurse: Negative triple velocity
 UndercoverToad: you don't have to think about collisions until you reach gold
 UndercoverToad: finding an efficient path is the most important in lower leagues
 MSmits: dont some people ignore collisions until legend?
 MSmits: or is that not possible?
 Astrobytes: Even in legend, yes
 Nezinau: thx, will work on my angles and boosts then&#160;:)
 YannT: MSmits plz don't block my legend push&#160;:(
 MSmits: well if my bot does well vs boss, i might pull him down for you
 MSmits: I did for renard earlier. I got to 6-1 pulling boss down, he promoted, then started losing :P
 YannT: I have a great winrate vs the boss too, I just can't get to it in a push&#160;:/ 
 MSmits: oh ok
 YannT: grr I just  seem to finish around top10, I'm just if I can't get there I'll pass
 MSmits: thats annoying Yannt&#160;:(
 MSmits: keep submitting
 YannT: I'll apply the kovi method until it works I guess :D 
 MSmits: maybe it pushes your competitors out of the league
 MSmits: like me&#160;:)

 VizGhar: hey C++ devs... BS... how you store nodes? in vector, array, or something else?
 Michael_Howard: Submit is definitely getting faster.
 Lysk: arrays
 struct: array
 kovi: YannT: today i have only submitted 2
 MSmits: not like you had a choice kovi&#160;:)
 kovi: valid
 dbdr: :D
 YannT: kovi: oh man, you're  slipping  ;) 
 CameronWatt: all ur base are belong to us
 AllYourTrees: sup
 Astrobytes: lol AllYourTrees
 AllYourTrees: :wave: :D
 Zenoscave: hey astro
 Razielwar: top are all in mcts?
 Astrobytes: pewpewpew zeno!
 Zenoscave: PEWPEWPEW
 MSmits: doubt that Razielwar
 MSmits: but there might be some
 AllYourTrees: aren't they all beam search?
 MSmits: many probably
 MSmits: but not all
 MegiAKAHammatopvcwchat: hey jojo fans
 Zenoscave: what's jojo
 AllYourTrees: oh shoot... "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time"
 AllYourTrees: didn't even know that could happen
 Razielwar: ahah
 Astrobytes: They lowered the threshold recently, very annoying
 reCurse: Just submit instead kekw
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: does anyone know the time period/game limit?
 VizGhar: MSmits going legend&#160;:) I'll need one more year probably to get there
 Astrobytes: Quite A Few, In A shorter Period Of Time Than Previously
 AllYourTrees: damn just what i feared
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: almost beat silver with my 50 lines of code that does something&#160;:(:)
 MSmits: VizGhar this one might again get stuck right under boss =/
 VizGhar: how long are you working on solution smits?
 MSmits: what do you mean
 VizGhar: well 20 hours? 60?
 VizGhar: I dedicated huge amount of time... but it seams I only learned how to code in C++ :D
 MSmits: ohh, well  most of the week when i wasnt working
 Lysk: MSmits "Sim perfect", so much trolling&#160;;)
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 BrunoFelthes: What Miyaza means? 
 Zenoscave: persons name i believe
 Magus: Miazaki
 Twelve0: name of gold boss?
 MSmits: Miyagi?
 Magus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki</a>
 Magus: (the gold boss name)
 Zenoscave: sorry msmits...
 Scarfield: looks like a solid submit PEWcave
 Zenoscave: I have a good w/r against most of league except boss... haven't been able to test much due to timeouts
 Zenoscave: Ope lost to smitty
 Zenoscave: YW MSmits
 MSmits: thanks :P
 Zenoscave: Won against boss!! MSmits i'll drop em for you
 MSmits: i just lost against boss
 Zenoscave: well don't do that
 MSmits: i just won against you
 Zenoscave: Don't do that either
 MSmits: got it
 ItsNotABug: I got my first win against boss. But then got beat when i did a new game&#160;:/ so im taking the positive
 AllYourTrees: i cannot figure out when a good time to complete a tree is
 Zenoscave: :D
 MSmits: hold your ear against the trunk and wait
 MSmits: until it says
 MSmits: "You complete me"
 AllYourTrees: oh duh yeah i never read that value from game input, ty!
 Zenoscave: lol MSmits that's enough weed for one day
 DevLorenzo: Hi, has anyone completed level 1 of the coding escape game?
 dbdr: how poetic MSmits&#160;:)
 VizGhar: nice :D
 MSmits: I can do poetic&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: But don't give up the day job just yet :D
 MSmits: It'd be poetic if i can finally get out of gold
 Zenoscave: what about perl poetry
 Astrobytes: ^
 MSmits: i saw that
 MSmits: whats special about it?
 Zenoscave: it's perl. and poetry
 Zenoscave: duh
 Astrobytes: It's poetry, in perl
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: you make good points
 Zenoscave: two losses to boss&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: chompdie
 MSmits: damnit
 Westicles: The kids these days are into hash poetry
 DevLorenzo: I'm stuck to find the number of universes
 Westicles: Write a poem that sha256 hashes with the most consecutive eights or something like that
 Zenoscave: ... why
 MSmits: Zenoscave do you have +50% vs boss?
 Scarfield: heightku
 MSmits: i have no idea what i have
 Zenoscave: no idea either
 Zenoscave: too many timeouts in IDE
 MSmits: ah yeah
 MSmits: I got only 1 match vs boss this submit
 Zenoscave: you've got a 67% against me currently
 Zenoscave: I've gotten 3
 MSmits: top gold is all very close in rating
 Zenoscave: Makes it a real barrier
 MSmits: yeah i guess so
 Scarfield: i think it was ille who said when he finally made it to legend he got straight to no. 40
 YannT: I failed around  top10
 YannT: I'll  repush with  incremental  changes until I make  it  to  legend in a stroke of  luck&#160;:&gt; 
 Zenoscave: YannT perhaps wait a bit. so many concurrent commits we just squabble and no one promotes
 YannT: it's okay at current pace I'll get there in 2 hours anyway
 Zenoscave: lol true
 YannT: also  I think I have a decent winrate against you, I saw my bot  stealing wins here  and there :D 
 YannT: I need your ELO  points for  the greated good  (me going legend), sorry
 Zenoscave: NOOOOOOOOO
 Zenoscave: not my TrueSkill
 YannT: :joy:
 DevLorenzo: Is there a way I can find help with the coding game escape game?
 Zenoscave: DevLorenzo there's an active competition. That'll be the main focus til monday here
 CouscousAgha: i think the only way stopping me from getting to legend is to figure out when to stop cutting trees
 MSmits: zeno, i need 0.35 to reach boss. 
 MSmits: get on it
 MSmits: 0.24 now
 Zenoscave: I need you to quit beating me. you're most of my losses
 MSmits: most of my losses are the green camel
 Zenoscave: That's the second most for me
 ddreams: Hi Zeno
 kovi: told you to stay wit 0.09 diff
 MSmits: i had a new version to test
 Zenoscave: Once his submit finishes I'll probably have better luck
 Zenoscave: .14 below rn
 MSmits: on my last submit, when i was around your&#160;% I was 2 pts ahead of boss =/
 Zenoscave: Yeesh
 Zenoscave: What happened/
 MSmits: i started losing
 Zenoscave: Already doing that
 YannT: then just kovi through it man&#160;:) 
 MSmits: well i meant on that submit
 MSmits: i am now too yes
 ddreams: I have an idea... hmm.. bbl
 MSmits: I will try to kovi through
 Zenoscave: ddreams, no ideas!
 YannT: :D 
 Zenoscave: only dreams
 MSmits: or maybe someone can just kovi boss down to my level
 Zenoscave: I'm trying
 YannT: it's pretty low right now, it seems to stay between  50 and  49
 Twelve0: hahaha
 MSmits: well you're wrecking me currently zeno :P
 Zenoscave: Sorry msmits....
 MSmits: ah well
 Zenoscave: Skot_z is my only issue currently
 MSmits: yeah i'll be glad when he is gone
 Zenoscave: It'll make submit much easier next time for you&#160;;)
 MSmits: possibly
 YannT: I repushed a version with tree reuse between turns
 Zenoscave: the camel has a 82.5% w/r against me 
 YannT: little  hope it does anything  good
 Zenoscave: &lt; .01 between me and boss...
 PRO_G_r_AM_m_ER: now i somethimes beat silver lol :cry:
 Zenoscave: I need to shut my mouth. I keep losing when I talk
 MSmits: or maybe because you dont use all caps
 Zenoscave: PEWPEWPEW
 YannT: worse case you'll  just land  riight next to it  and netflix until  you  get  promoted man 
 TobiasA: i just got to silver league
 TobiasA: woooohoooo
 MSmits: gj
 TobiasA: i am the winner of the entire game
 TobiasA: because if you didn't know silver is the new legend
 CameronWatt: lel
 ddreams: gz&#160;:)
 TobiasA: now i don't think i can make it to gold before monday but i'll try to make it to top 500
 skotz: sorry zeno&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: resub smitty?
 MSmits: yeah
 Zenoscave: any changes?
 TobiasA: wait nothing is different?
 TobiasA: in silver?
 MSmits: lowered beamwidth
 Zenoscave: TobiasA no changes after bronze.
 YannT: I like how your bot says sim is perfect and then it loses
 MSmits: well sim was perfect
 YannT: :D 
 MSmits: the search wasnt though
 Zenoscave: what does "perfect" mean here
 Astrobytes: It doesn't say search was perfect :P
 YannT: "II perfectly simulated this defeat" *explodes*
 reCurse: "All went according to plan, I lost"
 MSmits: it's just applies all possible actions to current gamestate and my own chosen action. Then keeps that list till next turn and checks against new gamestate
 ddreams: muhahaha
 MSmits: if one is exactly the same, then the sim is perfect
 Zenoscave: Gotcha
 reCurse: "My author has purposely programmed me wrong, as a joke"
 Zenoscave: lol recurs
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 YannT: yoo tree reuse  seems to actually bring something
 YannT: push is doing  good
 MSmits: you cant reuse them
 MSmits: when you complete them they're gone
 Zenoscave: Baduntiss
 Astrobytes: dearie me :D
 YannT: I'm  sorry, in your words I meant "sim perfect" MSmits&#160;:) 
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: I have a sim perfect prune array
 MSmits: oh noes
 MSmits: noone is above boss now
 YannT: jokes aside I get it,  my tree reuse I just pushed  is essentially the same thing
 YannT: look in child nodes for the move opponent played
 YannT: if found, great
 MSmits: yeah i use that in boardgames
 YannT: if   not,  sucks :D 
 dbdr: brutaltester does not support tournaments (more than 2 bots in a 2P game)?
 MSmits: it does
 MSmits: oh wait
 MSmits: no
 Zenoscave: dbdr no
 MSmits: 3p 4p games though
 dbdr: ok
 Magus: brutaltester can handle to 4 players
 Magus: (if the referee accept 4 players)
 MSmits: i looked for that option too
 Magus: but there is no "tournament" thing
 MSmits: i now manually manage tournament thingy in excel
 Magus: But .... I like the idea :D
 Magus: maybe after this contests I'll work a little on brutaltester
 Magus: I want confidence interval in the output
 reCurse: Mortal Tester
 Magus: and tournaments seems nice
 Counterbalance: grats zeno
 dbdr: esp as api benching is almost dead
 Zenoscave: YannT don't you dare
 YannT: coming through
 MSmits: uh oh
 Zenoscave: Counterbalance not done yet
 YannT: (hopefully)
 Counterbalance: no but it's a good sign
 MSmits: you would think so
 Zenoscave: I feel like that was a jinx
 Counterbalance:&#160;:]
 Zenoscave: -_-
 Magus: reCurse: fear my skill to find project names&#160;! My local "training arena" is called Abathur. And my tool to parse/analyse my replays JSON is called Overlord :D
 reCurse: I still think Mortal Tester is the most appropriate name to have one with tournament feature
 MSmits: Overlord is a good name for a cat
 reCurse: ^
 Zenoscave: All cats are named that
 Magus: my wife refused my names proposals for our cats
 Zenoscave: we just don't know it 
 MSmits: what were they Magus
 Zenoscave: Please tell me one was "horse"
 Magus: MSmits: Stackoverflow and Jira
 MSmits: lol
 Magus: According to normal people, they are not good names
 Counterbalance: arena tester name suggestion: Battle Royale (wrong author though)
 reCurse: According to everyone
 Astrobytes: wtf man
 Magus: But, I have named one of our rat Mutex
 reCurse: I was hoping for something funny
 Magus: It's still something, I suppose
 Astrobytes: Oh you have rats?
 YannT: why do  you hate  your pets honestly
 jacek: and he locked himself in
 Astrobytes: Rats are awesome
 Magus: I love my pets :D
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/kAJSA_f1_gY?t=11">https://youtu.be/kAJSA_f1_gY?t=11</a>
 YannT: :joy:
 Zenoscave: Mutex is good. I like it
 MSmits: wait, are these rats pets magus or does your house have issues
 reCurse: Why not both
 Magus: pet rats
 reCurse: Make the best out of a ratty situation
 Magus: 8 females, 7 males
 jacek: you should name your cat alfador :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Wow, you have a whole bunch of rats!
 Magus: (actually, 15 rats, 2 cats, 2 parakeets)
 YannT: Magus: so that's why you needed thread safety, because of too many concurrent rats?
 Astrobytes: Do they get along with the cats or they're not allowed to mix?
 reCurse: Must smell nice
 Magus: Cats never tried anything with the rats. They sniff them and that's it.
 YannT: Zenoscave: sorry mate  :/ 
 Magus: Rats want to play with the cats, but the cats don't want :D
 Astrobytes: hehehehe
 Zenoscave: 9 loss streak&#160;:/
 MSmits: damn
 MSmits: I feel your pain
 Zenoscave: Right when Counterbalance said gratz
 YannT: took a in on the boss
 MSmits: them Dutch people always sucking the fun out of things
 Zenoscave: lol MSmits
 YannT: bruno is kicking my ass  though
 Counterbalance: muhaha :grimacing:
 Astrobytes: Sucking the smoke out of spliffs you say MSmits
 MSmits: that too
 Zenoscave: you are the literal devil counter
 MSmits: thats the devil, only he can read
 Zenoscave: read what?
 MSmits: things
 Astrobytes: Zeno was getting high, then the Dutch came along and smoked the rest before he had a chance.
 MSmits: he oh wait thats literate
 Zenoscave: neato
 ItsNotABug: Was ~860 in gold. New submit is already top 300 after the first 10% :D 
 Zenoscave: Zeno doesn't smoke
 MSmits: because we took em
 Astrobytes: It's metaphorical!
 Zenoscave: It was the drink that killed me
 YannT: get outta here already BrunoFelthes you're cramping my style :p 
 Zenoscave: I was hit by a guiness truck
 MSmits: I'm on my way back up, hopefully this one has a better shot
 Zenoscave: I should eat today
 Zenoscave: I need a break
 BrunoFelthes: ahuahuahua
 ItsNotABug: fack. Another couple games and its dropped me back to ~500
 MSmits: or just some day
 BrunoFelthes: YannT you push me up
 MSmits: nice one BrunoFelthes, grats
 MSmits: now get out of our way
 YannT: I noticed :p  
 Ajay.komirishetty: Hey Gang
 Zenoscave: see this is when you say gratz. He has finished the submit
 YannT: go on, promote, I still have 50% and I4d rather you not be there :D 
 Zenoscave: gratz BrunoFelthes
 ddreams: gz BrunoFelthes
 Zenoscave: HAHAHAHAH INSTA KARMA YannT
 YannT: ah shit :D 
 MSmits: 16th now and it's less than 2 points to boss
 MSmits: so close all
 Zenoscave: MSmits quit it. I am at 95% no beating me
 YannT: it's okay, might as well  take  the L's at 50%  and kickass on the tail end of the push
 TobiasA: the moment you realize you are the only one from your country in a contest:cry:
 MSmits: I am hoping for some more boss battles, only had 2 last time
 ddreams: you're number one, TobiasA
 MSmits: both losses
 JRFerguson: i feel you Tobias
 JRFerguson: Uruguay here, always happens to me
 TobiasA: i am only one not number one
 BrunoFelthes: ahuhauahu, TobiasA, Brazil is a very big country, and we are not so many people here
 jacek: uruguay eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4paLVu0gNcQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4paLVu0gNcQ</a>
 Astrobytes: think you're best to wait for a push Zeno
 JRFerguson: lol jacek, i knew that Simpson bit
 Astrobytes: Otherwise this will be the luckiest submit in the history of today
 ddreams: I've lost 1 out of 8 vs. zeno
 TobiasA: haha that video
 JRFerguson: anyone has any good tips on how to simulate opponent&#160;?
 TobiasA: this is my first contest ever
 Zenoscave: I'll just wait for push
 JRFerguson: i just ignore opponent
 TobiasA: in anything
 Zenoscave: who keeps losing to bos?
 elderlybeginner: i don't even sim my turns or board
 Zenoscave: boss*
 MSmits: I lost 1&#160;:(
 YannT: not me, I went 2-1 against  boss
 YannT: and  now I fell&#160;:( 
 YannT: I blame  Bruno
 ddreams: 2-1 against boss too
 Zenoscave: 6-7 heare
 ddreams: Though I think I've never lost against YannT, my bot is his kryptonite
 Zenoscave: I know that's not a word. I know I can't spell shush astro
 MSmits: are you gonna wait Zenoscave?
 Zenoscave: yeah msmits
 MSmits: probably good
 TobiasA: those numbers in the leaderboard what are they?
 Zenoscave: I'm hungry and need food
 Zenoscave: Trueskill rank TobiasA
 MSmits: ranks and ratings TobiasA
 Eglerion: Any tips on how to eval game state?... I tried tons of different things over the last hours but my sim still can't beat my initial submit with hardcoded focus on seed, grow, complete in the middle of the board..
 YannT: can  all  og  my kryptonites  please promote switfly and clear the way?  :p  
 TobiasA: the decimal ones
 TobiasA: with arrow beside it
 Zenoscave: yes TobiasA trueskill ratings
 ddreams: Trying, YannT :D
 elderlybeginner: egl
 TobiasA: oh
 peerdb: Eglerion i have the same issue&#160;:(
 Zenoscave: bah 
 elderlybeginner: Eglerion - fix the main bug :joy:
 MSmits: oooh beat boss!
 JRFerguson: Eglerion: score, points per tree, points per lvl 3 tree, wait till the end and count sunPoints for each player
 JRFerguson: congrats MSmits
 MSmits: then lost to the tric&#160;:(
 elderlybeginner: which means: don't seed in your possible shadow
 MSmits: no i mean 1 game lol
 MSmits: almost zeno
 Ra777: Hello, anyone knows what is the limitation for games per time period in codingame?
 AntiSquid: yes
 Ra777: do you know what that limit is?
 AntiSquid: yes
 bragrejer: 15?
 ddreams: I do too
 MSmits: can you tell him what the limit is AntiSquid
 ddreams: or no
 ddreams: you mean in the IDE?
 casmith789: he can
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: jinx me Counterbalance i am above boss
 Counterbalance: gratz
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: it really works
 MSmits: my next game was loss vs boss
 AllYourTrees: oof
 elderlybeginner: MSmits, I think I saw you over the boss yesterday :joy:
 AllYourTrees: i feel like your next submit will happen
 ddreams: he was over boss earlier too
 VizGhar: gogo smitsy
 dbdr: MSmits was born above the boss
 Counterbalance: ra777 look at the bottom of the statement (and next time ask what you want to know, not if someone knows it - these people take everything quite litterally here&#160;:))
 VizGhar: you dont know how it feels dbdr :D
 dbdr: what?
 VizGhar: defeat boss... you were always step ahead of boss
 Ra777: than you, Counterbalance&#160;;)
 dbdr: I know it from previous contests
 dbdr: when legend was legend
 dbdr: and I was a noob
 aCat: oh, Smits on the run&#160;;-)
 DomiKo: Do you enjoy that game guys?
 YannT: I'm just a few luclky wins away now&#160;:) 
 Astrobytes: when legend was legend.Long live legend.
 VizGhar: I'm noob that cant reach legend yet&#160;:)
 YannT: don't kick me down MSmits plz
 VizGhar: My algo is too slow to search enough space and I can't write correct eval
 YannT: almost there
 VizGhar: YannT are you running BS too?
 AllYourTrees: MSmits see i told you
 Astrobytes: I never got legend in a contest. That doesn't matter though. What matters is that Legend is supposed to be pretty fking hard to get to.
 YannT: MCTS
 elderlybeginner: There is a serious battleground at the top :joy:
 VizGhar: ah ok :O I probably just don't know how to write fast algos in kotlin (main language for me)
 YannT: it boils down to don't no new in your algo
 YannT: new is bad
 YannT: pre-instanciate everything  you can
 VizGhar:  hmm can you avoid garbage collection?
 MSmits: damn, Harry is back
 MSmits: VizGhar dont make garbage
 ddreams: beating me too
 YannT: if you pre-instanciate everything and then don't do new in  your algo, you can avoid it mostly
 YannT: GC is bad, it'll time you out
 Nerchio: VizGhar what YannT said basically, use 1st turn to create most objects you need (like States/Nodes for search) and then never create new again
 Nerchio: but even if you optimize everything as best as you can it will probably be 2x slower than C++ lol
 VizGhar: this is completely different world then standard app development :D
 MSmits: very true
 YannT: it is
 ClockSort: looks like you did it, @MSmits. congrats
 Nerchio: true but maybe thats part of the fun
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 YannT: also don't do .filter or other things that will instantiate lists
 YannT: very bad as  well
 MSmits: eh ClockSort, last time i was this far ahead in my submit, i was +2 rating vs boss and still lost
 YannT: use .forEach and .repeat a lot instead and if (...) return@forEach/repeat
 MSmits: at least battles are going fast
 VizGhar: I understand the concepts behind all algos, but i like nice and readable code
 ddreams: but the previous time I was winning against you, now you're better
 YannT: bot coding contests are not the  place for clean code&#160;:) 
 YannT: do it dirty
 YannT: everything public
 Astrobytes: ^
 Nerchio: :scream:
 VizGhar: too late :D I'll do it next contest
 YannT: dirty code is faster&#160;:) 
 XeroOl: if you're in c++, you can just hide the dirty in a function
 XeroOl: and let the compiler inline it
 VizGhar: slowly getting there...
 MSmits: damn harry&#160;:(
 YannT: it's too crowded for my bot up there&#160;:(
 AllYourTrees: anyone got advice for how to tell what you did wrong in a game
 Astrobytes: If you lost, you need to...
 MSmits: look at how completes are spaced 
 Astrobytes: FIX IT
 MSmits: the yshould be mostly in the second half 
 MSmits: mostly spaced, not all at once, so you keep a steady income
 ddreams: cut all your trees
 MSmits: spread seeds so you dont shade your own trees
 MSmits: sometimes i have a tree at the end of the game
 MSmits: uncompleted
 ddreams: yeah, was mainly a jab at his nick
 Astrobytes: That can help in a tie MSmits
 MSmits: but it's richness 1, so takes 4 suns, gives 1 score, not worth it
 MSmits: right that too
 Chainman: what's the strategy to beat silver boss? I'm still losing 
 Nerchio: it can be worth it msmits
 MSmits: how
 MSmits: in the last turn, if the tree gives 1 point
 Nerchio: lets say you have 30 sunpoints
 Nerchio: -4 you have 26
 MSmits: ok
 Astrobytes: if you still have more suns than opp but just need a point
 Nerchio: equal on points
 Nerchio: u have +2 additional
 Nerchio: you can throw a seed now
 Nerchio: and win a draw
 Nerchio: or something
 ddreams:&#160;?
 MSmits: mmh doesnt make sense Nerchio
 ddreams: no
 Nerchio: ok
 Nerchio: you are right
 Astrobytes: see my comment
 MSmits: i dont see that happening Astrobytes, how is that possible
 MSmits: 3 suns is 1 point
 MSmits: you lose 4 points to complete
 ddreams: ok, so my first implementation of the idea gives me 100% losses, nice
 MSmits: 4 suns
 MSmits: so you always lose at least a point
 MSmits: and now you also lose a tree
 Astrobytes: Yes, it's not likely
 MSmits: so how is it ever worth completing a tree that gives 1 point
 Nerchio: so how about you have 30 suns, sell 1 tree, you can upgrade now seed to level 1, throw seed for 0 and throw seed for 1
 Nerchio: but its like a super corner case
 Astrobytes: It would need extreme conditions in my case too
 MSmits: why does selling a tree give you a chance to uprade a seed?
 MSmits: you can do that anyway
 Nerchio: because normally you have 30 sunpoints / 3 = 10 points
 MSmits: yes
 Nerchio: you will lose a point if you do anything
 MSmits: sure
 Nerchio: hmm yeah
 Nerchio: that probably doesnt work
 MSmits: give me 1 exact example,, i dont think it exists
 Nerchio: well i coded in my bot to never sell these tbh
 Nerchio: when nutrient 1 and richness 1
 ddreams: so instead you have 1 extra tree point and 26 sunpoints, giving you one less tree, but 2 suns to play with hmm..
 MSmits: last turn, big tree on richness 1, no nutrients, there exists no example where it is good to complete this
 ddreams: right, you lose 2 points
 ddreams: 2 sunpoints
 ddreams: so never good
 Nerchio: ok so if u have 32 sunpoints
 MSmits: you will still lose 1 point and 1 tree
 MSmits: and gain 1 point from complete
 Nerchio: true
 MSmits: so not worth it
 Nerchio: ok you win
 Nerchio: i always forget that u sell tree so you have 1 less now :D
 dbdr: rhichness 1 is 2 points
 MSmits: i dont win , am on loss streak&#160;:(
 MSmits: richness 2 is 2 points
 elderlybeginner: I wonder how you guys will fit in legend now
 MSmits: i think
 Nerchio: 1: +0 points.
 dbdr: ok, I use base 0&#160;:)
 CameronWatt: CoC is so addicting
 MSmits: wait nvm
 jacek: richness 1 is 0
 dbdr: 0 1 and 2
 dbdr: and -1 for empty
 DomiKo: so -1 base?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Nerchio: yeah i thought it was weird i actually noticed that richness doesnt equal points in gold or something
 dbdr: well, those are just ignored :P
 Nerchio: why doesn't it equal points? :P
 MSmits: me vs harry 4-9 this hurts
 MSmits: well he'll be gone soon
 elderlybeginner: Volt is back :joy:
 ClockSort: lol msmits why are you still golden
 elderlybeginner: for a moment only
 MSmits: an existential question I ask myself
 dbdr: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: Goldsmits
 elderlybeginner: yep, nice to watch that competitive fights :grin:
 AntiSquid: because the game is balanced
 VizGhar: hmm wasnt Voltmach above boss?
 ddreams: for a little while, yes
 ddreams: for beating me so much
 ddreams: MSmits looking great, jinxy kinxy
 MSmits: nooo dont jinx now :P
 MSmits: 1 more battle
 MSmits: yay!!!!
 ItsNotABug: winner
 ddreams: nice, gz&#160;:)
 VizGhar: clap clap
 YannT: ah time to  repush,  way seems  to be clear :p 
 MSmits: there's still harry
 MSmits: well not for long
 YannT: he'll  be  gone by the time I get there
 MSmits: true
 YannT: 10/10 first  batch
 YannT: good omen&#160;:) 
 MSmits: 4/10 here&#160;:)
 Chainman: how good is it to try to just place size 3 trees in the middle and not harvest till end of game 
 MSmits: its bad
 ddreams: well, I'm going to resubmit too.. the discussion of richness point made me realize I can't read
 BrunoFelthes: bad
 Chainman: really?
 MSmits: Chainman you shade yourself
 YannT: well it's good to go silver, even gold
 Chainman: but won't you shade more than yourself potentially
 Chainman: Yeah I need to get gold for context haha
 MSmits: yes, but with opponent the shade works both ways
 YannT: make best trees  worth most points in whatever manner, gets  you to gold 
 Chainman: I'm trying just gold worthy strategies
 MSmits: with you, it works doubly on yourself
 MSmits: so dont shade yourself
 MSmits: watch top games, you'll see thats the most important thing they do
 YannT: yeah for gold just grow as  many trees  as you can on richest spots, harvest  at the end
 YannT: that should  do  it
 MSmits: to get to gold
 Chainman: oh
 MSmits: not to get to legend
 YannT: he  wants to  get  gold  no?
 Chainman: yes
 tobk: dang... my bot was Gold 400, now after resubmit only Gold 750... of course that last submit took 9 hours, so maybe there's just 300 guys who passed me in that time?&#160;:-/
 MSmits: oh ok
 Chainman: I want to get to gold first.
 MSmits: tobk it could also be that the guys who were submitting were not at their proper rank
 MSmits: it takes time to move up the ladder
 tobk: MSmits Yes, that's what I thought after the 9h submit, but in fact I resubmitted since then and ended in pretty much the same spot. Maybe that first submit was just super-lucky...
 XeroOl: how are people so far with java
 MSmits: ah ok
 XeroOl: java seems like it would be a bad language for contests
 tobk: XeroOl Why?
 ddreams: java has been a bad language for everything since C# came out :p
 XeroOl: because you're forced to deal with the memory allocation stuff
 XeroOl: they don't have structs, so the moment you try to abstract anything, your code runs slow
 Astrobytes: You have to be clever about it
 YannT: java  is a decent language for  contests
 YannT: you just can't do  whatever  you want&#160;:)  
 MSmits: XeroOl you make all your objects in the first 1 second
 XeroOl: unless you start by just allocating giant arrays of primitives
 XeroOl: but that sounds painful
 XeroOl: you might as well use C
 MSmits: thats normal
 ddreams: you can allocate everything you need
 MSmits: I do this in C++ and C# also
 YannT: no you don't do it  for priimitives
 ddreams: initially
 Astrobytes: JVM warmup
 YannT: primitives  are  already cacched  in the VM
 ItsNotABug: My bots capable of beating msmits and gold boss. But it still ranked 360th in gold&#160;:/ Too inconsistent to rank high&#160;:( 
 Astrobytes: allocate a bunch of objects instead
 MSmits: ItsNotABug capable of beating msmits or capable of beating him 50+ out of 100
 XeroOl: that just seems not ideal
 XeroOl: hmm
 YannT: "sim perfect"
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: it makes the creature look kind of arrogant doesnt it
 Astrobytes: Do some calculations in the first second. Helps with JVM warmup.
 YannT: ddreams: plz promote I have a horrible winrate vs you
 ddreams: Trying :p
 ddreams: you can just push me over, and then resubmit&#160;!
 ddreams: I'm at 49.13 and boss at 49.25 :p
 ddreams: If only Harry would stop beating me down
 Astrobytes: Submits slowed down again?
 MSmits: harry is annoying\
 theycallmedavid: How does the response time restriction work? I'm measuring my response and in the worst case it is 250+ms, but only once in the middle, and multiple times it is a bit over 100ms. It looks like it is not a problem. 
 YannT: ddreams: grah I was hoping  you'd get pushed you were equal  to t he boss&#160;:(
 YannT: why u stiill here  man
 ddreams: Harry is at 97% tho
 Nerchio: theycallmedavid start calculating time after first input and the end before output
 ddreams: Harry is gone legendary
 theycallmedavid: That is how I measure
 theycallmedavid: Wait, no
 theycallmedavid: Ok
 ddreams: you timed before first read?
 theycallmedavid: Yes
 ddreams: then you time the opponent too
 theycallmedavid: I see
 theycallmedavid: Now it is much better
 theycallmedavid: Thank you
 ddreams: chat is helpful
 Chainman: ahhh I can't beat silver boss
 ddreams: post a replay, chainguy
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556171635">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556171635</a>
 ZarthaxX: gz MSmits!!!
 AllYourTrees: did you get it???
 ddreams: Chainman try to spend more of your sun in the middle game
 MSmits: thanks ZarthaxX&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: gz MSmits
 MSmits: ye i got it finally
 MSmits: 3 submits where i went above boss, only last time i stayed
 Astrobytes: grats MSmits!
 Chainman: okay I"ll try
 Dakkad: std.error is behaving odly for me for the first time... any known problem/bug? 
 MSmits: thanks astro
 Astrobytes: Please state the nature of your stderr emergency Dakkad
 Dakkad: I wouldn,t say emergency, but here goes:
 Dakkad: I have a console.error('lol') on line 502 that shows up on every round, except for the round where line 503 throws an exception.
 Dakkad: I usually can rely on the previous line of code to debug the following line of code.
 ddreams: flush?
 ddreams: dunno how js stderr works
 Astrobytes: Flush issue I think yes
 Dakkad: This time, when I get this exception thrown on line 503, no prior console.error() shows up
 Dakkad: What is a flush issue&#160;:-) (something I can google?)
 ddreams: often output is buffered for performance reasons
 ddreams: flush means to make sure it's sent to the destination
 Dakkad: What can I do about this problem?
 ddreams: google
 Astrobytes: What are you coding Dakkad?
 ddreams: or wait until a js-person with knowledge chimes in
 Westicles: How does printing lol give you more information than it not printing?
 Dakkad: It's just to simplify the conversation with an irrelevant std.error Westicles.
 Chainman: wooo finally won 135-124 
 Dakkad: i.e. this guarantees there's no error in my console.error() :p 
 Westicles: Oh, well the other option is the error was on line 502
 Dakkad: @astrobytes, I'm coding the spring challenge 2021 in javascript
 Astrobytes: Are you coding for the contest or something else Dakkad?
 Astrobytes: Right, gotcha
 Zenoscave: I got pushed!!!!
 Astrobytes: Is there a relevant code snippet (NOT full code) you could post?
 Twelve0: congrats 
 ddreams: Nice, gz Zeno
 Astrobytes: PEWPEWPEW Leg End!
 Zenoscave: Thanks&#160;:)
 elderlybeginner: I think I'm loosing more when there are richness 0 cells. Any idea how to modify action scoring taking into account that factor?
 Dakkad: @astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/91447232-ffa9-4ba2-a7a2-79b4adf27011">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/91447232-ffa9-4ba2-a7a2-79b4adf27011</a>
 ddreams: boss at 48.90, I'm at 48.85 :p
 ymoukhli: congrats twelve
 Twelve0: not yet
 ddreams: don't jinx it&#160;;)
 YannT: I'm coming please be nice
 ymoukhli: spoke too soon 
 Counterbalance: Dakkad what's the exception message?
 Dakkad: TypeError: Cannot read property 'size' of undefined
 Counterbalance: f.tree is undefined
 Dakkad: Yes yes, that's obvious&#160;:-) 
 Twelve0: thank you anyway ymoukhli 
 Dakkad: I know what the error means, but I'm trying to use console.error() to find out what object it receives
 Astrobytes: I hope that ` is a typo :P
 YannT: ddreams my dude, don't knock me down
 Dakkad: it was me trying to format for discored&#160;:-) 
 Dakkad: There are no backticks in the actual code
 Astrobytes: :D
 Twelve0: sorry YannT
 Westicles: that ` is spider poop on your screen
 Dakkad: every forest object has had a tree in this array for hundreds of runs... I messed up something about the array, but can't find out since console.error() doesn't work on that specific round....&#160;:-(
 YannT: it's okay I still  have 50%  and youi guys are gone soon :D 
 Astrobytes: It's on the other side of the room now Westicles
 YannT: I seem to have a decent winrate on Valphyr too, that helps
 Zenoscave: Man this is a dog fight in legend
 Westicles: Oh good Astrobytes.  Probably laying eggs
 Zenoscave: Who was gold boss?
 ddreams: Bernard_Lowe
 Astrobytes: Westicles: Probably waiting to lay eggs in my ears or hair I'd say.
 ddreams: lol, both me and the boss have 48.94
 Astrobytes: Cats will get it if it dares to come down from up there though.
 YannT: ahh finally
 YannT: bye ddreams
 YannT: won't miss ya :p 
 Astrobytes: nice one YannT
 Chainman: I'm not always winning against silver boss&#160;:(
 ddreams: yay
 Counterbalance: Dakkad ok, because that error is an uncaught exception, the process exits and stdout/stderr are not flushed. You can try wrapping the code in a 'try {} catch () {}'
 Chainman: I'll submit to see if it is good enough to win 50% against boss 
 ddreams: 10 losses 3 wins in legend
 ddreams: well, time to submit a better bot
 Chainman: :flushed:
 Chainman: I don't think my bot is going to get in gold with this submit
 Chainman: But I might be closer to top of silver 
 Dakkad: Hey @astrobytes, @counterbalance. I removed all my console.error() and kept the one I absolutely needed to debug this, and they now shows up
 Dakkad: as if I had been logging too much for the following rounds to keep on logging
 Dakkad: I tried with a try catch as well (with all the console.error()s and it didn't work)
 Astrobytes: Ah. If you see a ... at some point, you logged too much to stderr
 Astrobytes: It is limited
 Dakkad: Yeah, that was the case, but I thought this "max" was cleared for each round
 Dakkad: vSolved! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 ddreams: it's not cleared for each round?
 Chainman: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556191535">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556191535</a> He's on top in  silver, he is just putting all seeds as closest to middle in the game.  But he also uses sun points better  mid game. 
 Chainman: He is harvesting quite early
 ClockSort: i've been stuck at Gold 8 to 15 for the past day. That's enough. I'm going for it with a new submit, wish me luck! New feature: reuse search tree from previous turn as a start for the next search.
 ddreams: Chainman I think you have too many level 3 trees
 Zenoscave: good luck ClockSort
 ddreams: I should probably have submitted this bot earlier
 MSmits: grats Zenoscave
 ddreams: 116 in legend now
 Zenoscave: thanks MSmits
 Chainman: wow nice
 Zenoscave: doing gradient descent optimization on constants now
 Zenoscave: Param tuning
 struct: grats both
 Astrobytes: nice
 DomiKo: Opponent fitting would be better
 Zenoscave: DomiKo what do you mean by opponent fitting?
 DomiKo: Choose one player and fit params to beat him and upset him: D
 Zenoscave: Lol fair
 Zenoscave: I'm too low for that to have much impact though
 Chainman: hmmm okay yeah with that change ddreams I seem to beat ksaw at least once of 2.
 Chainman: He is still beating me, but I win sometimes now. 
 DomiKo: Itf funny how even my bot know that top player won in day 12 :D 
 Chainman: He takes so much of board throwing seeds.
 Chainman: I was trying to only throw seeds 1 at a time, and only do it 2 distance from another tree.
 Astrobytes: Oh, YannT, I thought you promoted earlier, my mistake&#160;:(
 YannT: no I've bneen knocking  on the door
 Astrobytes: You'll enter soon I'm sure
 YannT: been above the boss, it's really down to good/bad luck at this point
 Astrobytes: Always
 Chainman: 29 in silver, I don't know if this bot will promote
 Chainman: I have a better version to submit already though so I think I'll get in gold. 
 Astrobytes: Don't give up Chainman
 Westicles: You can do it chinaman
 KelvinAndHubbles: found a wee bit of difficulty getting out of Silver for some reason though, hit top 100 4 days ago, and haven't moved much despite changes, probably just my botched code&#160;:/
 Chainman: chinaman lol
 Chainman: :joy:
 YannT: I'mma kovi this crap
 YannT: tune constant by .05 and resubmit until legend
 Chainman: cool
 Chainman: coming for bossooot
 cegprakash: depth = 1 eval doesn't work for depth = 5 and depth = 5 eval doesn't work for depth = 1 how am I supposed to debug this eval
 reCurse: "kovi this crap" that's a new one
 Queuebee: does anyone have a rough max amount of actions to make by a player in any given turn?
 KelvinAndHubbles:   3 or 4 usually works for my bot
 Chainman: 4 people in my way to beat boss 
 Queuebee: I meant what could be the possible max so i can set a Action[size] for that but nvm ill just use list lol
 Numby: Does code in the IDE get throttled if you run it a bunch of times? I've noticed I'm getting time out if I run it a bunch but after taking a pause it runs fine (using replay in same conditions between runs)
 Chainman: wait when you are one spot behind boss you don't battle him?
 Chainman: oh I passed the boss
 Chainman: but I didn't atually have an battles with him
 ddreams: as long as you are ahead with 100% completed games you'll promote
 Chainman: crap I'm swapping places with him
 Chainman: I'm 2nd to him again
 Chainman: okay now I'm above by about .5 trueskill 
 Chainman: that should be good
 Chainman: bossoot in java 
 ClockSort: my MCTS just loves cutting trees too much. Around turn 15 it might cut everything if it thinks the opponent can't catch up. Any advice?
 BrunoFelthes: heuristics, fix it to not cut
 Queuebee: Your MCTS can tell you what it thinks? O_o
 ClockSort: here's an example. the percentage in Message is its chance of winning. It thinks 90% chance of winning  after the forest is gone. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556211617">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/556211617</a>
 Queuebee: So why does it think that ^^
 ClockSort: it doesn't see that the opponent can hold trees for a very long time afterward. in the random rollouts, the opponent cuts randomly sooner than the very end of the game..
 BrunoFelthes: the of in your mesage is the number of rollouts?
 ddreams: more sims or prune the actions perhaps?
 ClockSort: @bruno it's the rollouts for the chosen move
 mybk: are you adding the sunPoints/3 when comparing the win/loose&#160;? 
 BrunoFelthes: i have a rule that i always have at least 3 tree 3 until turn 18...
 ClockSort: @mybk yes
 BrunoFelthes: it works for me
 mybk: ok
 ClockSort: @BrunoFelthes 3 large trees?
 BrunoFelthes: yes...
 ClockSort: that would definitely shake things up.
 ClockSort: my bot chops way sooner haha
 Chainman: how could I get started with MCTS?  hmmm
 ClockSort: read wiki article
 ClockSort: it was a long learning process for me
 Chainman: how long have you been doing it? 
 ClockSort: i started at the start of this contest and it took 3 days to get it working enough to get out of bronze
 ClockSort: because i'm a noob :D
 Chainman: Where are you now?
 Chainman: I am too
 ClockSort: Gold #23
 BrunoFelthes: try first only monte carlo... than bean search, then MCTS, I think that this order is nice
 Chainman: I tried a beam search but scratched it, so I can advance with heuristics.
 ClockSort: i think search algs are the best way to improve as a coder
 Chainman: finally promoted to gold wooot
 ddreams: not bad
 Chainman: lol 1404, I'm in the bottom 
 ddreams: still gold
 YannT: I think I've got it&#160;:) 
 Chainman: maybe I'll go back to my search algo now.
 YannT: fixed another bug
 aangairbender: my mcts with duct cant beat my beam search
 aangairbender: sad
 Chainman: yannT about to go to legend
 BrunoFelthes: until wednesday, I had a bug at my code because I was using a signed byte to store the score... So, my bot was tring to do a max of 127 points...
 ClockSort: lol
 YannT: maybe, no jinx plz :D 
 Chainman: Okay so this boss is in python3. 
 ZarthaxX: F BrunoFelthes
 KelvinAndHubbles: I have positive winrate against like everyone in the top 50, but randomly losing to neesh like 1700/1950 rated in silver&#160;:/
 ddreams: sometimes it's a bit of rock/paper/scissors
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, I have a problem with the "hoarders" as I call them who don't sack until the end. It's kinda a coinflip in those games
 Stormalix: how do i even begin with coding a bot
 ClockSort: anyone else get random "-1" results? like 1 in 100 games? 
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, that means timeout error or some error ClockSort
 ClockSort: i'm wondering if it's timeout or crash, any way to tell?
 KelvinAndHubbles: you can send to IDe, but I've had it change a million times on me
 ClockSort: i load in IDE and no crash or timeout.
 KelvinAndHubbles: yea, either you, opponent have random or Codingame is just playing tricks with your head
 ddreams: if you are usually far away from the timeout, it's probably a crash
 mybk: timeout -&gt; maybe memory issue 
 ddreams: if you're sometimes around 100ms normally, probably timeout 
 pmor: the memory thing has bitten me a few times.
 mybk: me too
 pmor: I now have my own allocator that I use for most of my containers
 mybk: what do you mean&#160;? 
 YannT: I think I've got this this time :D 
 pmor: i get a block of memory from the system, and then I have my own memory management of that block
 pmor: you can pass the allcoator into vector, unordered_map, etc
 mybk: ah cool, advanced tricks, cool, maybe I need to learn c++ (properly) for the next context, right know I am using java
 pmor: yeah, this is a c++ thing. Java is a whole other beast with the GC
 mybk: yeah it's a big problem 
 Zandy156: I enjoy making fast heuristic bots work as well as I can.
 mybk: yeah I missed that, I enjoy that also, next context I will spend more time doing heuristics 
 Zandy156: I barely got top 2k in the potion contest because of it.
 Zandy156: hopefully the next one isn't like that one
 cegprakash: is 5 a good seed for srand?
 Zandy156: are there bad seeds?
 cegprakash: no idea
 pmor: there isn't a difference in what seed you use.
 pmor: if you use the same seed though, you will have the same results come through rand
 pmor: i don't think anyone here is able to take advantage of that
 casmith789: you probably want to use the same seed if you want to debug the bot when it loses to see what is going on
 pmor: yeah, its a pain if you use a changing seed.  I keep to one
 Littleyounes: Codingame c'est une dinguerie quand meme
 Littleyounes: sous coté
 pmor: oui 
 somnek: xqcL
 Pick8chu: does anyone uses brutaltester on windows with javascript?
 Pick8chu: I've been working on it since yesterday still hasn't work
 Pick8chu: cause of the readline
 ClockSort: what kind of buffer against the 100ms are you guys using?
 ClockSort: I'm on 90ms and I'm not sure if that's the cause of my "failure to provide a move in time"
 ddreams: gz YannT
 ddreams: now you can come push me up again&#160;;)
 pmor: I currently have 70 due to my getvalidactions call can take over 20ms
 pmor: I'm adding in pruning to reduce the cost, which should allow me to up it 
 YannT: ddreams:  I'm in front of you tho :p 
 ddreams: hehe, three spots, perfect for fighting
 ddreams: well, I guess we both are not in submission, so
 ddreams: and I'm heading to sleep
 Wontonimo: ClockSort, you don't need more than 1/2ms of buffer.  Make sure you start your timer after the first line of input you read
 reCurse: There are server hiccups you can hardly prevent
 JohnCM: all right, reached gold!
 ClockSort: @Wontonimo that's interesting, i'm starting it too late -- at the start of my searching.
 Cjx_1: gj 
 Pick8chu: does anyone know how to execute js file with spider monkey?
 JohnCM: is the gold bot a heuristic bot?
 Zandy156: I think so
 JohnCM: it's a huge upgrade over the silver one. i'm losing it by 60 pts
 ClockSort: recurse so this might not be my fault? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556304651">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556304651</a>
 reCurse: I don't know it's hard to tell
 reCurse: If you print the time taken in debug and it's always the same time
 reCurse: And on a random turn it jumps to +15-20ms
 reCurse: Then yes that's it
 JohnCM: the gold bot is blocking all my trees, no wonder my pts so little
 Kellthazar: its pretty well implemented
 Zandy156: that's its main strategy
 ClockSort: Gold #2, COME ON COME ON
 Wontonimo: go ClockSort go! 
 Cjx_1: gogogo :D
 MyCCODE: Can you do aa favor to subscribe to my channel - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEHp4w8fTDoOcRUwG8qTypQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEHp4w8fTDoOcRUwG8qTypQ</a>
 Wontonimo: no
 Wontonimo: (secretly opens up channel and looks at all videos)
 Wontonimo: Cool, unity dev.  Did you compete in this challenge using C#?
 MyCCODE: Yes, sure
 Wontonimo: I don't see you on the leaderboard.  You know there is a competition going on right now right?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: its been 5 days of learning c++ and my beam search can finally beat my python heuristics bot.
 cegprakash: NotSureWhyThisWorks awesome
 Wontonimo: congrats!
 cegprakash: but are u sure why it works NotSureWhyThisWorks
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I'm so happy lmao
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: Nah not sure still
 Wontonimo: yeah, it's a great feeling!
 cegprakash: NotSureWhyThisWorks NotSureWhyThisWorks
 Lokmene: any escape room 
 cegprakash: lol
 Lokmene:&#160;?? 
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: wontonimo did your mcts get you into legend?
 Wontonimo: no, i couldn't get it working as well as my MC-1ply bot which got me into legend.
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: still impressive
 Wontonimo: i think the MCTS i wrote would probably rank about 600 gold, maybe
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: I actually don't mind the idea of a MC-1ply bot I didn't know that existed
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: how many rollouts can you get within a single turn?
 Wontonimo: i don't know if it has an official name, but that's a name that LazyMammal came up with, so i'm using it
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: fair enough
 Wontonimo: around 3k*24/(24-day)
 Lokmene: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/e8H-807-aUJ-l1R">https://escape.codingame.com/game-session/e8H-807-aUJ-l1R</a>
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: not bad
 Wontonimo: I think that's pretty low and with some profiling I should get that up to 10k if I put some sweat into it
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: are you using c++?
 Wontonimo: yeah c++.  btw, everyones lang is posted beside their bot.
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: ok true
 Anti-Matter: Just wondering but for the games we have to write everything in the one file, yeah? we don't have access to multiple files
 Numby: Yeah but it can get a little unwieldy to do this locally. I used a python script to stitch all my files together into one
 Anti-Matter: ooo wait you can code on your PC and then upload to codingame?
 Whiskee: yeah Codingame Sync is a nice extension you can use 
 Whiskee: every time I build on my IDE it lanches a script that merges all my .cs files into the one that's synced here
 Anti-Matter: naisu
 mnechromancer: Hey, just wanted to say to everybody in chat that you guys are awesome. This is my first bot-coding competition and I'm working a lot more on it than I thought I would, and my last version made it into silver! Couldn't have done it without chat's help, and I still have so much to learn :grin:
 Whiskee: the only part that's a little weird is that I have to put all using statements inside the namespace, because they can't be at the top level on a merged file&#160;:)
 Anti-Matter: hmm, can you test the code you wrote locally or do you have to upload it first
 Cjx_1: &lt;3 I would echo mnecho
 Wontonimo: hope to see you around after the competition mnechromancer , there's lots of other challenges here between competitions
 Whiskee: always nice to see some enthusiasm!
 Whiskee: Anti-Matter there are ways to do that, they were discussing it earlier
 Kellthazar: Anti-Matter you can use the source code of the game that CG provided on github.
 Zaphus: finally sorted out why my brutaltester was failing every time.  turns out the game referee was not supplying any possible moves on the first turn, causing my code to return nothing.  Doesnt happen in the real game but multiple referees I tried all had the same issue.  Just forced a wait on turns without moves and it works... I think.  All the starters fail for the same reason&#160;:-(
 Pick8chu: Wait
 Pick8chu: so brutaltester  is not working because of the refrees?
 Numby: I feel like as soon as I solve my issue with unbound memory growth and stop timing out I'm gonna jump to top gold: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556323585">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556323585</a>
 Zaphus: for me, yes - I tried the referee alone and it still failed with starter bots
 Pick8chu: well mine doesn't work neither
 Pick8chu: It's so frustrating
 Zaphus: put a check in your bot for a turn with no possible turns supplied, and return "WAIT" on that one
 Zaphus: see if it helps
 Pick8chu: wdym?
 Pick8chu: for starters, i always return WAIT
 Enknable: Numby are you use recursion?
 Pick8chu: but non of them works
 Numby: I think the issue is I either go over the memory limit or garbage collections trips me up. When I run my bot locally it never not provides a turn
 Zaphus: do you return "WAIT" - or do you return command[0]&#160;?
 FrancoisB: Anyone using rust-sourcebundler? 
 Numby: No recursion but my search tree might be too big
 Enknable: are you timing your game?
 Numby: I'm thinking of trying a pool of nodes and reusing
 Pick8chu: string action = get&lt;0&gt;(possible_actions[0]) + " " + to_string(get&lt;1&gt;(possible_actions[0])) + " " + to_string(get&lt;2&gt;(possible_actions[0])); // default
 Numby: Yeah, you can see I print out the time and it's consistently at 80-81 ms (limited at 80)
 Pick8chu: so it should be "wait" since the first one is always WAIT
 Zaphus: thats the problem, there are no possible actions - just force "WAIT" and see what happens
 Pick8chu: Oh
 Pick8chu: there's no possible actuons??
 Numby: so it doesnt seem there's turn variability causing it go over. Imo it's because I keep allocating objects and eventually GC cleans them up and I time out on that turn
 Zaphus: again, for me on windows this is what is happeneing, looks like a referee bug but that change fixed it for me
 Pick8chu: Oh you're right
 Pick8chu: they don't have any possible actions
 Kellthazar: How deep are your simulations? 2 ~ 3 days?
 Zaphus: if it is happening on other turns then it makes the referee useless - thats the next thing I want to check
 Enknable: after your first stdin, start = chrono:time, then after every iteration check that (chrono:time.now &lt; 75)
 Numby: I added depth limit of 4 simultaneous actions
 Enknable: then at least you won't timeout
 Enknable: or w/e # works
 Kellthazar: Hmm
 Pick8chu: so i should code without having possible actuons?
 Numby: Yeah I'm already doing timing myself after first input (System.nanoTime() in java equivalent_
 Enknable: ok ok
 Enknable:&#160;:)
 Zaphus: @pick8chu looks like it only happens once from a quick check
 Pick8chu: only once
 ClockSort: what is the memory limit for spring challenge?
 Wontonimo: the same
 Wontonimo: it's in the faq ... what's that link?
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 ClockSort: 768mb
 ClockSort: well that's a problem, i'm using 2gb. :D
 Pick8chu: now my replay board is not shown lol
 Pick8chu: says demo.js file is not there
 pmor: I wish CG would tell you why you timed out...the memory issue plagued me in previous challenges.
 pmor: and I believe I was getting a time out from a stackoverflow
 pmor: for this challeng
 Wontonimo: what is taking up all that space ClockSort?
 pmor: at least I'm able to tell when a sigv happens
 ClockSort: @wontonimo my brain
 Wontonimo: well, it's swollen cuz it needs to fit in 768mb
 ClockSort: working on it
 ClockSort: ok, submitting a new bot with a smaller brain. thanks for the help
 Numby: ClockSort i'm rooting for you I'm struggling with the same exact issue lol. Will need a bit longer to fix though
 ClockSort: i sat on Gold #1 but the bot is better. nobody knows my pain :joy:
 Wontonimo: i've been there.  not on a contest though
 pmor: at least youre gold ...
 Wontonimo: can anyone tell me the GoldBoss score&#160;?
 mybk: 48
 mybk: 48.43
 Wontonimo: you curb stomped it reCurse ... geez man, go easy.
 struct: holy
 k4ng0u: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/reCurse">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/reCurse</a>no mercy xD
 JohnCM: recurse to legend soon
 JohnCM: clocksort, you just need to sit your bot there, eventually some pro programs will push the elo of the bot down and you will rise
 mybk: to top 10 soon&#160;;)
 struct: seems like rank 1 bot to me
 JohnCM: yea it's like owning everyone
 Wontonimo: HAHA
 Wontonimo: there is a certain satisfaction from those kinds of submits
 struct: his bot plays different from top from what I can tell at first
 KelvinAndHubbles: should I do anything if I'm 1st, but not beating boss?
 KelvinAndHubbles: Ik Smetly just kind of waited for two hours and he was above
 mybk: yeah, ameliorate your bot, play against yourself, if you win 8 from 10 battles =&gt; submit
 Wontonimo: i waited about 18 hours and I got moved from 35th into next league.  It's a gamble though.  it could be that you get pushed the opposite way
 struct: Protect your bots if you are in legend
 struct: duck
 JRFerguson: my bot is afraid
 CouscousAgha: yo who spawned the legend boss in gold?
 struct: lol
 struct: 100% win rate on legend?
 struct: any bets?
 CouscousAgha: hard
 struct: its 50/50
 casmith789: definitely not
 k4ng0u: one loss against the gold boss!
 k4ng0u: it's not invincible anymore :D
 struct: time do put it in the bin
 struct: to*
 CouscousAgha: top 24 already
 struct: uff it didnt play vs me
 struct: im safe
 KelvinAndHubbles: problem with it beating my bot 80% of the time is I don't know if thats just countering my bot or actually good
 CouscousAgha: bro
 CouscousAgha: this bot is madness
 CouscousAgha: lmao i imagine the look on top legends' faces
 CouscousAgha: whent hey wake up to this
 struct: Imagine going to sleep and wake up to this&#160;:'(
 CouscousAgha: god of ubisoft
 CouscousAgha: imagine if it's made by an ubisoft hardcore dev 
 CouscousAgha: reCurse go easy on people
 Zandy156: wow
 Counterbalance: a non committal submit, immediately to rank 1
 JRFerguson: insane
 mybk: what do you think recurse use like algorithm&#160;? 
 pmor: skynet
 JRFerguson: saelyos beat him 
 struct: I think cg can save the servers and end the contest 
 Zandy156: its like its day 1 of contest and one person actually tried.
 VincentBab: insane xD
 JohnCM: recurse has won plenty of previous competitions. this one should be easy for him
 JohnCM: but the sun shifting is really difficult to code for
 CouscousAgha: theyw ere like meh i will do this in one saturday afternoon and submit it
 struct: japan is already reacting to recurse&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: this has reminded me it's high time I code my NN harness for CG competitions
 struct: This reminded me that is time for me to stop coding
 mybk: isn't the limitation for NN in CG too high&#160;? 100ms/100kb file size&#160;? 
 struct: yes
 struct: there are plenty of NNs though
 mybk: so how we can do NN 
 struct: compress the weights
 UndercoverToad: reCurse wtf
 struct: toad woke up 
 dbdr: yeah, just saw :D
 struct: Throw the towel
 Marchete: +5 points euler
 Counterbalance: 6 point lead
 dbdr: gg reCurse
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/reCurse">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/spring-challenge-2021/reCurse</a>
 pmor: you missed the carnage as his bot took the throne
 Zenoscave: I broke my bot
 struct: Everyone had alarm to when recurs e submited
 struct: lol
 UndercoverToad: let me guess: the almighty NN
 struct: I would say yes
 Wontonimo: and alphaZero enters the battlefield
 Zenoscave: cool Good to know My eval is super fragile
 UndercoverToad: so he has a winrate as high as struct when bronze opened?
 struct: lower
 struct: i had 100%
 Zenoscave: slightly lower
 dbdr: noob
 dbdr:&#160;;)
 ZarthaxX: gg lol
 Wontonimo: well, i don't think truskill really works for more than 8 points difference no matter how one-sided the battles are
 Marchete: you lose points by winning
 struct: yeah
 Pick8chu: is the refree working now?
 Pick8chu: I'm trying to code possible_actions but it's tricky
 Zenoscave: I have the same losses as recurse this submite
 Zenoscave: so far
 Zenoscave: just less wins
 struct: he lost 1 match in gold
 Zenoscave: Jesus
 struct: vs the boss
 Zenoscave: Nevermind
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556355349">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556355349</a>
 UndercoverToad: that's why he already submitted today: was scared of the boss
 Zenoscave: however fixing my coeffs jumped 50 places so far
 Marchete: was scared of CG servers going slow
 Zenoscave: Is it very time dependant his solution? or is it nearly instant
 Marchete: I'll wait his PM :D
 UndercoverToad: play him vs him to see how fast it goes
 Marchete: I like to read PM a lot
 Marchete: they are interesting
 UndercoverToad: the only thing that can stop him now is CG seeing obfuscation in his NN encoding
 Marchete: but are you sure is NN?
 Zenoscave: They wouldn't do that would they?
 Marchete: It's hard to do it here
 UndercoverToad: of course i'm not sure
 Marchete: too many different bits
 Marchete: with one hot encoding
 Zenoscave: I'm sure it's just weights and they've stood on the fact of weights are fine i thought
 Marchete: 37*4 *2
 Marchete: just trees
 UndercoverToad: 37 for richness37 for owner37*4 for size
 UndercoverToad: plus points and suns
 kovi: that hurt...
 kovi: but better now than tomorrow
 Marchete: I'd say owner*2
 struct: Just wait
 Wontonimo: i'd instead do 9 for richness, 9 for owner, 9*4 for size and convolve it ...but i haven't tried NN on CG, so i'll let you know how it goes
 struct: Ive been saving the bot that I made during testing for this
 Marchete: convolve seems good here
 Marchete: because of rotations and such
 Marchete: and it needs less weight but more CPU time
 Counterbalance: isn't nn nearly instantaneous once trained? it's just fixed number of multiplications and additions.. his bot seemed to squeeze every millisecond out of each turn..
 Zenoscave: maybe training inline on top of?
 Marchete: convolutional isn't
 Marchete: convolutional is like taking a point and its neighbours
 Marchete: and calculate
 kovi: its still mts (duct?)
 Wontonimo: *caugh* alphaZero *caugh*
 Marchete: so guess how many calcs
 kovi: (i guess)
 kovi: mcts
 Marchete: robosta_c also has very good A0 bots around there
 Marchete: it shouldn't be that easy to pull it a working NN here (due to restrictions)
 Marchete: CG*
 dbdr: local training
 Marchete: I mean size restrictions
 Marchete: and CPU time
 Counterbalance: it's probably just a search with 10 million sims&#160;:)
 ZarthaxX: LOL
 dbdr: training is CPU intensive
 struct: heuristics maybe?
 Wontonimo: if (losing) { win }
 Wontonimo: i should have thought of that
 mybk: System.makeMeWin()
 mybk: No SAO Fun here&#160;?
 Wontonimo: well reCurse, if you are listening, Good on you!  Really, cheers for showing what can be.
 Smelty: when's the contest over
 struct: now
 Smelty: ah 1 day
 Smelty: hi mr. str0ct
 dbdr: lol struct, was gonna say the same&#160;:)
 Smelty: lol
 Smelty: hi mr mod
 struct: hi Smelty
 Smelty: 7 mods in a room what do they do <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snipboard.io/7zJ2WV.jpg">https://snipboard.io/7zJ2WV.jpg</a>
 Smelty: hi
 UndercoverToad: they intimidate
 Kellthazar: trying to simplify my evaluation heuristc...
 Kellthazar: my bot stop to plant seeds after a while. XD
 Hoyer: I keep getting `An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time."`
 Hoyer: whats the limit
 Wontonimo: how many did you do?
 Hoyer: idk a few, I was adjusting parameters
 struct: its very low atm
 Wontonimo: (joke aside, i think you only need to wait 5 min)
 struct: they lowered it
 Wontonimo: (says in deeper voice) only 5 min
 Wontonimo: oh, you mean numerically ... okay
 UndercoverToad: "atm"these restrictions will remain the way they are
 ALDERS0N: you guys are so annoying
 struct: thanks
 Zenoscave:&#160;:+1:
 ALDERS0N: w
 Kellthazar: o__o
 JRFerguson: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/556374400">https://www.codingame.com/replay/556374400</a>

 Zenoscave: could be hiding against ide?
 JRFerguson: dbdr, we both have 100% win rate against reCurse
 struct: you wasted your luck on the ide
 struct: rip
 dbdr: dunno. I thought I just got lucky
 struct: he has an if
 dbdr: JRFerguson&#160;:+1: :D
 struct: random chance to lose
 dbdr: I don't think reCurse needs hiding
 struct: nah
 struct: nobody can adapt their bot to beat this
 Zenoscave: not even dapo?
 ZarthaxX: lol
 ZarthaxX: clash of titans
 struct: maybe pb4 is coming
 ZarthaxX: would be amazing
 Zenoscave: would be scary
 Zenoscave: ftfy
 Wontonimo: that would be fun to watch
 JRFerguson: or Agade
 Marchete: I'm not sure this is easy for a NN, also the possible moves are big
 Marchete: 37 * grow sizes
 Marchete: 37*20? seeds
 Marchete: etc etc
 ClockSort: should be easy to prune seeding, or is that not true for NN?
 Wontonimo: i had a hard enough time figuring out how to queue the moves in MCTS Marchete, the though of how to do that with NN made me remember I want to go to sleep soon.
 Zenoscave: depends on how you encode/decode actions
 BrunoFelthes: anyone are processing moves during opponent turn?
 ClockSort: you don't get cycles during opponent turn
 Marchete: or maybe he just use it for value
 Zenoscave: *shouldn't* get cycles
 Marchete: in that case is just a number
 struct: What do you mean BrunoFelthes?
 Marchete: pondering
 Marchete: and it doesn't work here
 BrunoFelthes: while you are waiting for your next input, maybe your opponent is doing some move... you can use this time...
 struct: no
 Wontonimo: your instance is paused
 struct: Its gets paused
 Marchete: paused it gets
 Zenoscave: They fixed that?
 BrunoFelthes: how they do it?
 Marchete: linux AAA knowledge
 Zenoscave: lol
 Counterbalance: cgroups
 BrunoFelthes: yeah, it is not a 100% for sure... but i already notice that my process is slower during opponent turns...
 Marchete: you'll get a10% or so
 Marchete: it's the referee time I guess
 Marchete: at some point you are "allowed", but not in enemy time
 Marchete: it's some another time inbetween
 BrunoFelthes: cool
 ClockSort: 100ms is already a lot of time
 Marchete: so tldr, just don't waste time in pondering
 Marchete: isn't worth it
 ClockSort: it's enough time for my MCTS to decide on its bad move. more time would just make it more confident in the bad move
 BrunoFelthes: not for my Garbage colletor
 Marchete: or trying to use more than 1 vCPU
 Marchete: ahh
 Marchete: GC
 Marchete: then yes :D
 ClockSort: GC :grimacing:
 Marchete: but the best way to improve CG is never using it
 Wontonimo: don't have garbage
 Zenoscave: I should look into my GC in my bot
 Zenoscave: Haven't done that yet
 BrunoFelthes: yeah... but I changed now to MCTS, it is very hard to not use GC on it...
 Wontonimo: what Marchete said
 Marchete: class NNN{ 
 Wontonimo: (oh sorry, bad timing)
 Marchete: static NNN[];
 Zenoscave: in C#?
 Marchete: static List&lt;free&gt;
 Marchete: static List&lt;used&gt;
 Zenoscave: this works?
 Marchete: NNN getNew()
 Marchete: void setFree(NNN)
 Marchete: setFreeAll()
 Marchete: ofc, both Java and C#
 Zenoscave: so write maloc free and clear
 Marchete: if you want to keep "new"

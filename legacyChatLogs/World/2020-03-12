 AnkitAnand_12: Hey AutomatonNN , where is Automaton2000&#160;??? 
 Automaton2000: because there is no point
 AutomatonNN: what are you trying to do?
 AnkitAnand_12: are you sure Automaton2000 , that there is no point . See even AutomatonNN is asking what are you trying to do . 
 Automaton2000: i dont do multi in a day. i do multi in a day or two
 AutomatonNN: get to bronze with a lot of improvements
 Zenoscave: does avx work with CG?
 Zenoscave: I'm having trouble running some vectorized code
 miszu: sup all. Finally translated my AI from java to C++. Let's run it and see if it goes smoothly with no errors... :joy:
 miszu: of course it had to throw an error...
 35005185: :joy:
 MSmits: be happy if you get an error.  You might also run the program and only get timeouts for unknown reason
 leolebossdu06: Im a biiiiiiiird
 wlesavo: dbdr is it just resubs or some optimization indeed?
 dbdr: optimized
 dbdr: was my first sub with this code&#160;:)
 wlesavo: oh, just wanted to ask how many subs for new one
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Danyosate: are some guy bots in CoC?
 Danyosate: cuz they are CoCing every time..
 struct: yes
 struct: if there aren't enough players they join
 struct: if players join, they leave
 Danyosate: and how many CoC questions they have in database?
 Danyosate: I won't meet a question I did before, nor will other players
 struct: I guess they have every answer
 Danyosate: so if every player played x different CoCs, there should be at least x * 8 different 
 struct: They usually take quite of bit of time to submit
 Danyosate: and don't share codes
 MSmits: they basically submit another players result
 MSmits: this way it is as if you played against that player
 MSmits: which is fine, it turns the coc into an asynchronous game
 Danyosate: but how big could the database be
 Danyosate: imagine that 8 players, not bots
 Danyosate: they all played 100 different CoCs. the next one they play toghether should be different to their played 800 CoC
 struct: Not how it works
 MSmits: there are a few hundred cocs
 MSmits: more than 300 at least I think
 MSmits: you will see repeats eventually
 Danyosate: what if i played more than 300. 
 MSmits: you will see repeats long before that
 Danyosate: i played 138 in few days cuz i'm new here
 MSmits: you can copy paste results
 Danyosate: ..
 MSmits: if you saved them
 Danyosate: lol
 MSmits: that's just the way it is
 Danyosate: i DID meet repeats. but not completely same.
 MSmits: hmm ok
 Danyosate: but this platform is far better than the ones I tried before
 Danyosate: although ide is terrible
 MSmits: ah, personally I don't do coc. Coc is not the strength of codingame
 MSmits: try the arena's, code bots
 MSmits: or optimization arena's
 MSmits: i dont use the ide much either. I code in VS
 Danyosate: i have to say, currenty it's too hard for me:joy:
 MSmits: then coc should be viewed as practice mostly 
 MSmits: i couldn't code very well when i started here
 Danyosate: yep i reckon it's good for practicing
 MSmits: puzzles are a better way than coc to learn to solve bigger problems
 MSmits: coc always remains small
 MSmits: puzzles get bigger and harder as you tackle more complicated problems
 Danyosate: yea it's good to get familier to a new language basic grammars
 MSmits: right
 struct: my opinion on CoC still remains the asme
 struct: same*
 struct: but i have 3k+ clashes
 struct: it creates too many bad habits
 struct: you should avoid it
 MSmits: someone should make a puzzle progression tree as preparation for learning to code bots on CG
 MSmits: there are plenty of puzzles to choose from
 Danyosate: yea for shorter  faster, but not for better
 MSmits: no i mean actual puzzles, not coc
 MSmits: you start with simple puzzles, then harder ones, while learning the skills to do good in bot arena's. It should be possible to do this
 MSmits: but currently it is hard to pick the right puzzles. There are too many
 Danyosate:  i mean coc as struct said, and for puzzles, there are something same, most voted codes always be the shortest  and the hardest to read
 Danyosate: well i just did eazy ones...
 MSmits: ah you mean other people's solutions?
 MSmits: I never really looked at them
 MSmits: I learn from solving them mainly
 Danyosate: yep in ez ones, 'best practice' might lead to a wrong feeling: ' coolest shortest is the best'
 Uljahn: newbs are just more impressed by shorteness
 Danyosate: in some case, there are few details really important, solving them is just not enough, need to be stronger better..  my opinion
 MSmits: if you progress to more difficult puzzles, you'll be forced to be better, otherwise you dont solve
 Danyosate: shorteness is not so difficult, even use some 'guessed consts'
 Danyosate: yea, agreed
 Danyosate: i struggled in 'the labyrinth' the bfs for few days.. i think i'd better to finish ez puzzles first
 maman02: its a fucking bullshit
 MSmits: :cow2: :poop:
 MSmits: labyrinth is one of those puzzles that is somewhere in the puzzle progression tree. It is good practice for bots/optims
 MSmits: but might be better to do other puzzles first
 MSmits: one of my students solved it in python
 Uljahn: there are some good introductory puzzles from aCat
 MSmits: i was mightily impressed by that
 tekki: nice
 Danyosate: almost got it... I might solve it tonight:sweat_smile:
 Danyosate: what I mean is, I hope there could be more 'stronger' solutions I could see and learn from the 'view other's codes'
 Danyosate: not all showing shorteness
 struct: you wont really find stronger solutions on CoC
 Danyosate: cuz reading other's code for a same puzzle I just did, is really a good learning
 Danyosate: no, i mean  in the 'practice'
 Danyosate: not coc, it's just for little tricks
 wlesavo: MSmits some starter bots helped me to improve the quality of my code as well, but yeah, puzzles helped to start a lot
 MSmits: I tried to use a starter bot once or twice, but I end up completely stripping and rewriting it
 MSmits: I just dont like the style of them usually
 wlesavo: sure, but some things just didn't come up to me before i saw it
 MSmits: ahh ok. Well you end up seeing plenty of code while googling and reading other people's pm in multis
 ThunderbirdOne: i should maybe start reading those starter kits and maybe some PMs
 ThunderbirdOne: bored shitless anyway :p
 kovi: 299? wow
 dbdr: I got a 291 locally
 dbdr: do you have more ideas kovi?
 kovi: yeah
 kovi: radical and can only work for short length
 MSmits: ooo radical
 MSmits: break the system. Stick it to the man
 ThunderbirdOne: that's rad dude
 MSmits: anyone want to give a free hint on bulls and cows. I might try it sometime in the next few weeks
 MSmits: like something that is common knowledge
 ThunderbirdOne: what is this bulls and cows thing?
 MSmits: it's mastermind
 MSmits: with numbers instead of colors
 ThunderbirdOne: aaah
 MSmits: and varying length codes
 MSmits: 1-10
 ThunderbirdOne: doubles allowed?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i'm done with checkers for now. Got top 10, but dont feel like tweaking eval
 MSmits: just have the king/men count
 MSmits: finishing up langtons ant, until it works
 MSmits: then i'll either go breakthrough or bulls/cows I think
 dbdr: MSmits: common knowledge: you can keep track of all possible solutions
 dbdr: prune them as you get responses
 MSmits: really? Arent there very many with 10 choices?
 MSmits: length 10 i mean
 dbdr: N = 10 =&gt; 3265920 possible guesses
 dbdr: so yeah, for 9-10 you need to take care of performance
 MSmits: hmm ok, that's something
 MSmits: thnaks
 dbdr: that's why you see fast languages on top
 dbdr: you should like it I think&#160;:)
 MSmits: I was going to keep track of rules instead of possible codes
 MSmits: constraints
 MSmits: maybe thats not feasible, dunnop
 struct: can numbers repeat?
 dbdr: it's definitely possible to keep them, but then what?
 MSmits: you can recursively try all possible codes while taking the constraints into account
 struct: can the solution be 111111111
 dbdr: no repeats
 struct:&#160;?
 struct: oh ok
 MSmits: the recursion will be short with more constraints
 dbdr: yes, it's the first turns that are challenging
 FuSheng: hello all
 MSmits: well the first turn is just 1234567890
 FuSheng: i am learning python
 MSmits: good for you
 dbdr: the ones after that :P
 FuSheng: well i  learn python from a website called ww3.schools thingy
 FuSheng: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp</a>
 FuSheng: oh theres the link
 MSmits: it just appeared magically
 FuSheng: i need to learn it in two weeks for school because i have a project to work on for 10weeks
 MSmits: you need a python knowledge mind transplant
 FuSheng: i think im fine with some chapters
 ThunderbirdOne: you need to learn python/coding in 2 weeks?
 ThunderbirdOne: good luck :p
 MSmits: python in 2 weeks is doable, but not if you can't code yet
 FuSheng: however i am stuck understanding stuff like inheritance, iterations and stuff
 [K]Gabor: Hi
 [K]Gabor: Its not that hard
 [K]Gabor: you can do it&#160;:)
 MSmits: inheritance is an advanced subject
 dbdr: you can learn python in a few hours if you know coding&#160;:)
 FuSheng: well i used to do C/C++ but not really a good student.. i got D for C++
 MSmits: iterations is not
 dbdr: the basics of course
 ThunderbirdOne: you can code without inheritance (it'll suck.. but hey)
 FuSheng: well my project requires me to assemble and program a RC car which includes wifi models and stuff
 ThunderbirdOne: coding without iterations... eeeh
 [K]Gabor: :D you would get a B for C--
 MSmits: imho, you shouldnt be able to pass C++ with a D, should at least be a C or better, so C+ (+)
 FuSheng: including rasbparry pi and technopacket or something
 FuSheng: honestly i think the best i can do is from first chapter to arrays
 MSmits: do the w3 schools thing or codeacademy (just for python2, which is ok)
 FuSheng: im doing the w3 schools
 FuSheng: just the tutorials
 MSmits: do some puzzles here too
 MSmits: the easy ones
 FuSheng: oh 
 FuSheng: cool which ones?
 MSmits: first do the w3 schools though
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah, finish that
 MSmits: need the basics before you start
 ThunderbirdOne: would probably only suggest the original CG Easy puzzles
 MSmits: FuSheng, just try different things from the easy puzzles yeah
 MSmits: sometimes you may run into a weird one you dont like, just pick a different one
 MSmits: they're not all equally hard
 FuSheng: oh yeah you know what? i hated C++ puzzles
 MSmits: or easy
 FuSheng: i couldnt even do the easy ones like lol 
 MSmits: puzzling in python is much easier
 MSmits: c++ sucks with string manipulation
 FuSheng: ill give them a try in awhile ima just rant my school stuff lol
 MSmits: python much better for that
 FuSheng: i cant understand classes and objects too
 ThunderbirdOne: oh man, the string manipulation is the reason why i haven't done many puzzles in c++ yet
 ThunderbirdOne: C# spoils you with everything it can do to strings :p
 MSmits: I have trouble just outputting stuff :P
 FuSheng: like class myclass 
 MSmits: class yourclass?
 ThunderbirdOne: do w3schools FuSheng
 FuSheng: then class student(person) and __init__ functions
 ThunderbirdOne: or codecademy
 FuSheng: the w3school exercises i did em all
 FuSheng: and i did the quiz too
 struct: python is the better language
 struct: In the most played multi is rank 1
 MSmits: unless you want to guess the secret number in bulls and cows :P
 FuSheng: but i dont see any good like projects or something to help me apply my knowledge
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/power-of-thor-episode-1</a>
 FuSheng: realy
 FuSheng: really
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/the-descent</a>
 FuSheng: power of thor.. shit that was hard in C
 FuSheng: and the descent in C
 MSmits: do it in python npw
 FuSheng: i didnt even manage to get full&#160;:(
 MSmits: easier
 FuSheng: ok ill do it now but
 FuSheng: if i go there how can i come back to this chat?
 MSmits: there is only one world chat
 struct: you  always get chat now
 struct: since you are level 3
 MSmits: you'll stay in it
 FuSheng: oh thanks
 MSmits: unless you annoy a mod :P
 FuSheng: cool that means ill be here with you guys while coding
 MSmits: yep
 FuSheng: oh yeah honestly i hate being in school 10hourss stuck on a computer screen learning python lol
 MSmits: my dreamday imho
 FuSheng: like 830am to 6pm 
 struct: you learn 10 hours python per day?
 MSmits: oh... I get to do an AI course in a few weeks!
 FuSheng: only 1hour lunch break, 20mins tea break one before and after lunch
 FuSheng: yeah 
 FuSheng: in school 
 struct: So you only learn python?
 MSmits: basic, but still. I dont even mind that I probably know all of that already
 struct: Doesnt make a lot of sence
 FuSheng: yeah the school curricum
 FuSheng: im a 3rd year
 MSmits: 3rd of what?
 FuSheng: polytechnic
 FuSheng: its tertiary but not university yet
 MSmits: how old are most in this class?
 FuSheng: 18
 MSmits: ah ok
 FuSheng: and older
 MSmits: thoats a year or so older than the students I usually teach
 FuSheng: i think you can compare it to high school in US, here in singapore we call it polytechnic and stuff
 MSmits: I see
 FuSheng: kindergarten &gt; primary school &gt; secondary school &gt; polytechnic &gt; university
 MSmits: why technic?
 MSmits: does that include social studies?
 FuSheng: no
 FuSheng: uhhh stay here ill send u a wiki link so u can read it
 MSmits: ok so not everyone goes that way
 MSmits: I'll stay
 MSmits: I live here
 FuSheng: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Polytechnics_in_Singapore">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Polytechnics_in_Singapore</a>
 FuSheng: lol u live here , you must really love coding
 MSmits: yeah, but not all kinds of coding
 MSmits: I like coding that requires problem solving algorithms
 FuSheng: oh
 MSmits: mostly I code bots, like most others on chat here
 FuSheng: i see
 struct: I just pretend I code
 FuSheng: how do you code bots? l
 struct: and delete accounts
 MSmits: but most of us did a bunch of puzzles too
 MSmits: FuSheng, you get a game, every turn the game sends you input about the state of the game, then your bot runs a program to find rthe best move, then outputs that move
 MSmits: then its the opponents turn
 MSmits: etc.
 FuSheng: oh yeah how do you change from c++ to python in games
 FuSheng: oh i see .. i tried those once on c and i gave up lol
 MSmits: click on the C++ at the top
 MSmits: yeah, get better with puzzles before you do bots
 FuSheng: oh ok thanks
 FuSheng: found it
 MSmits: should be able to solve medium puzzles with some ease I think, before you try bots
 FuSheng: honestly i dont know why my school project is requiring me to use python
 FuSheng: doesnt seem lika a lot of fun.... to me... 
 MSmits: python is a good beginner language
 FuSheng: just programming a car to detect /capture images and run through a track
 MSmits: hmm well you can do that with other languages as well
 ThunderbirdOne: so it's arduino right?
 FuSheng: and of course making an app joystick to control the car 
 MSmits: could also be microbit
 ThunderbirdOne: are these the "mbot" cars?
 MSmits: or lego 
 FuSheng: not sure, i read the senior's report
 ThunderbirdOne: we do these mbot arduino cars in coderdojo
 ThunderbirdOne: and they just need to follow a black line on white paper (it's a pretty thick line)
 MSmits: ah, so light sensor
 FuSheng: in his report he used raspberry and stuff
 MSmits: and a light
 ThunderbirdOne: not sure
 FuSheng: a small camera, led, wifi module??? i cant remember
 ThunderbirdOne: it's got this one sensor that returns 0 if it's full on black
 ThunderbirdOne: -1 if black is on the right
 ThunderbirdOne: and 1 if it's on the left
 ThunderbirdOne: or somethign like that
 ThunderbirdOne: it's SUPER simple
 FuSheng: ill go  snap a picture of the report tomorrow
 FuSheng: it contains everythingggg
 MSmits: I had a few students build a robot with 4 sensors, 1 for each direction. It could follow a spot made by a flashlight
 ThunderbirdOne: cool
 FuSheng: oh i see
 MSmits: line following is pretty easy
 FuSheng: man trust me the project is 12weeks&#160;:(
 FuSheng: im gonna screw on my presentation so badly lol i know it
 Astrobytes: Things have defo moved on from a Meccano 'car' on a metal rail anyway lol
 ThunderbirdOne: it'll be fine
 FuSheng: crap what is import sys lol
 ThunderbirdOne: I had 12 weeks to write my dissertation on matrices when i was 18
 ThunderbirdOne: in hindsight, that was a LOT of time
 MSmits: import statements give you access to more functions that are in libraries
 FuSheng: wait is that math reports&#160;?? 
 FuSheng: oh i see
 MSmits: like the sys functions
 MSmits: probably the input and output stuff
 FuSheng: today i covered the last 6 topics from the bottom of ww3.schools, not sure if i still reemember them lol
 ThunderbirdOne: programming is a lot of muscle memory
 FuSheng: the classes and init functions all confused me
 Astrobytes: Gotta practice em to learn
 FuSheng: shit 1week more..
 MSmits: yeah, just write short programs for easy puzzles. The more you solve, the faster it will go
 FuSheng: to learn...
 ThunderbirdOne: learn as you go
 ThunderbirdOne: seriously
 ThunderbirdOne: and google everything
 MSmits: first few in python took me an hour. In the end it was 10-15 min of which most of the time was spent understanding the problem
 FuSheng: are there hints
 ThunderbirdOne: you can copy paste togethere solutions
 MSmits: some have hints yeah\
 FuSheng: lol i am so going to see every solution
 Astrobytes: no
 FuSheng: because i cant do it
 MSmits: you need to solve it before you can see other people's solutions
 MSmits: but you can ask for help here
 FuSheng: oh
 MSmits: if someone is willing
 FuSheng: wait let me do the first testcase 
 FuSheng: ill brb in 5mins
 MSmits: i'll be off for a bit, my train is arriving and i'll walk home then
 ThunderbirdOne: i'll be here for a while longer :p
 ThunderbirdOne: gotta go home in 3 hours, they're closing the flood barriers and i have to get there before they do
 ThunderbirdOne: because i won't get my car off the parking if i'm late
 MSmits: yes you said you were bored
 ThunderbirdOne: that too
 MSmits: allright ttyl
 FuSheng: ok sure msmits ill br hrtr in sehilr
 FuSheng: o you better hurry thunder
 ThunderbirdOne: it's 2pm :p
 ThunderbirdOne: i still have 3 hours
 FuSheng: gg i failed descending mountains
 ThunderbirdOne: (well, slightly less... I still have to walk for 5 mins)
 FuSheng: dude seriously just 1 look at the code and i am blank
 ThunderbirdOne: what are you stuck on?
 ThunderbirdOne: what's your thought process
 ThunderbirdOne: you solved that one in C right?
 FuSheng: but i forgot
 FuSheng: now im doing it in python
 ThunderbirdOne: you can go back to your C solution
 FuSheng: nooo
 ThunderbirdOne: and then switch back to python
 FuSheng: i wanna stay on python
 ThunderbirdOne: i mean like, you can see what you did to solve it in C
 ThunderbirdOne: and then translate that to python
 Astrobytes: Yes but you can translate your C code to Python
 ThunderbirdOne: the general idea behind it is the same
 FuSheng: oh crap how do i see my c solution 
 ThunderbirdOne: don't make it harder on yourself than it already is
 FuSheng: it doesnt show on the thing when i click c/c++ 
 Astrobytes: Switch to C or whatever you did it in and check the History tab at the left
 ThunderbirdOne: Results (on the left)
 ThunderbirdOne: then History tab
 Astrobytes: my bad, I'm in a multi rn
 ThunderbirdOne: ooooh
 FuSheng: oh found it
 FuSheng: heres my c code
 FuSheng: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19ed2708-dd8b-40d1-9d0c-229c8ff1fbf3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/19ed2708-dd8b-40d1-9d0c-229c8ff1fbf3</a>
 Uljahn: duuuude
 FuSheng: but i needa code in python hmmm
 ThunderbirdOne: oh god
 ThunderbirdOne: the horror
 ThunderbirdOne: you def. don't understand iterations :p
 FuSheng: yes 
 FuSheng: i dont understand
 FuSheng: at most i can do is this
 ThunderbirdOne: that is what we would call "hardcoding" a solution
 Astrobytes: Sorry, I'm still in shock
 Astrobytes: :D
 FuSheng: wait let me go to ww3 schools goddamit i covered this this afternoon 
 ThunderbirdOne: the descent has the solution on the left right? (under hints)
 FuSheng: ok you know what i really dont understand 
 Astrobytes: Yep. The idea is to cover all the test cases by writing a solution that can solve any of them
 FuSheng: iter is the opposite of recursion isnt it 
 ThunderbirdOne: not exactly
 ThunderbirdOne: it's easier to look at iterations as "loops"
 FuSheng: oh
 FuSheng: wait how does the hints help
 Astrobytes: Like applying an operation to each item in a list, one after the other
 FuSheng: im supposed to look at '1' right? stdin stdout stderr?
 FuSheng: OH WAIT THE SOLUTION
 ThunderbirdOne: do read all the statements above it as well
 FuSheng: uh ok the solution looks hard bruhhhhhhhhhh
 ThunderbirdOne: read through the solution and try to understand it
 ThunderbirdOne: it really isn't that hard
 Astrobytes: Read through the hints, to make sure you understand what's going on
 struct: Ok this is not making sence
 ThunderbirdOne: what is not making sense?
 struct: On linux using avx sqrt I was getting around 900% increase
 struct: on windows I get 2000
 struct: wtf
 FuSheng: nope i dont get it
 FuSheng: i know mountain_h is mountain height
 dbdr: struct: yes, that's strange. might be explained if you use different compilers
 struct: well on ubuntu i was using gcc
 struct: and windows is VS compiler
 dbdr: if the linux compiler generates better code for the non-avx version
 Astrobytes: optim levels?
 dbdr: if you want to be sure, look at the assembler
 FuSheng: damn it guys
 ThunderbirdOne: it really isn't that hard FuSheng
 ThunderbirdOne: you get x mountains.. and you need to pick the heighest
 ThunderbirdOne: soo
 FuSheng: well guess what
 ThunderbirdOne: you loop over them
 FuSheng: i guess im a creep 
 ThunderbirdOne: first mountain, is it the heighest? well, we don't have anything to compare to, so let's say it is
 ThunderbirdOne: next mountain, is it the heighest? you compare it to the first, since that was the heighest to date
 ThunderbirdOne: next mountain, is this higher than the heighest we've already seen?
 ThunderbirdOne: you go over all these mountains
 FuSheng: no
 ThunderbirdOne: and at the end, you know which one is the highest
 ThunderbirdOne: and you output that
 FuSheng: oh
 FuSheng: but what is int(input) for 
 ThunderbirdOne: that is how you read the mountain heights
 Uljahn: you are given strings
 ThunderbirdOne: int = a number
 Uljahn: so you need to convert them to numbers
 FuSheng: oh
 Ducknaro: hi
 Ducknaro: huys
 Ducknaro: asd
 ThunderbirdOne: so FuSheng is it making a bit more sense now?
 FuSheng: yes
 FuSheng: it is
 FuSheng: thank you
 ThunderbirdOne: keep it up, practice will make reading code easier
 FuSheng: ok ima try the other game xDD
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr seriously?!
 kovi: he had 291 locally
 FuSheng: whats dbdr
 dbdr: that's me&#160;:)
 ThunderbirdOne: another user/player
 eulerscheZahl: oh dearno way i can spam my way up there
 FuSheng: oh
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.snipboard.io/DXrxhv.jpg">https://i.snipboard.io/DXrxhv.jpg</a>
 FuSheng: guys this is not about coding but
 eulerscheZahl: same code or different for those submits?
 kovi: wow, huge variance
 FuSheng: dude why would i get blocked for saying bye to someone 
 dbdr: 307 was my first sub with this code
 FuSheng: what the heck is wrong with people these days
 dbdr: my local average is around 317 I think, with min 291
 dbdr: in 200 runs
 dbdr: I should compute the standard deviation
 dbdr: and the max
 dbdr: 10	1:  5.30   2:  5.06   3:  4.98   4:  5.40   5:  5.62   6:  6.30   7:  7.00   8:  8.10   9:  9.24   10: 10.62   min=299  avg=316.90  0.20/s
 dbdr: after 10 runs
 eulerscheZahl: do you have the batch and solver bundled to 1 program?
 eulerscheZahl: or could you replace the solver by another code easily?
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: are you willing to extract some stats for me?
 dbdr: shoot me&#160;:)
 wlesavo: dbdr since you up to it i would appreciate an advice on validators modification
 Trollmen: hey guys
 dbdr: euler, I said yes to both
 Trollmen: for chuck norris puzzle, what's the binary for&#160;%?
 eulerscheZahl: and i sent you a PM dbdr
 Trollmen: I am getting 100101, but the answer seem to be starting with 0
 dbdr: I know, that's why I'm saying this
 dbdr: I don't call an external program, it's a library. but I have several solvers in it
 Uljahn: Trollmen: ascii should be exactly 7 bit long
 wlesavo: dbdr i mean quantity/quality/necessity
 eulerscheZahl: oh, so no replacement my a completely independent solver like brutaltester does it for multis
 wlesavo: Trollmen it should be in form of 0100101
 dbdr: not trivially
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 dbdr: I would also need to think how to run that efficiently
 dbdr: starting the solver each time might be a big overhead
 dbdr: wlesavo: OK. I guess I could start by measuring variance
 dbdr: and measure the impact of doubling the validators, for instance
 wlesavo: thx a lot, that would be great
 dbdr: in theory, I think that would mean sqrt(2) less variance
 wlesavo: well there is always tails, so the absolute difference could even grow
 dbdr: sure, but it would mean a better solver has a better chance
 dbdr: if you multiply the number of validators by N, the advantage of a better solver is multiplied by N, and the noise multiplied by sqrt(N)
 wlesavo: well generally yes
 wlesavo: also dbdr how you generate the number?
 wlesavo: i mean secret
 dbdr: randomly, so that does not match the validators exactly
 wlesavo: oh i see
 wlesavo: that can give some disturbance
 wlesavo: although shouldn't matter much for higher numbers i guess
 dbdr: I think this puzzle is like NS, there is more depth than it looks at first&#160;:)
 kovi: yeah

 Astrobytes: lol, thanks Magus
 dbdr: not ban? :D
 eulerscheZahl: which author do I quote?bb|!bb
 Astrobytes: Shakespeare
 eulerscheZahl: :thumbsup:
 reCurse: I always go on just after the fun ends
 reCurse:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: ban a random user of the remaining ones and see how they react
 Marchete: free ban?
 Marchete: free is good
 eulerscheZahl: let's ping automaton in order to find the lucky winner
 eulerscheZahl: wait, bad idea
 dbdr: russian roulette
 dbdr: with 6 bullets
 struct: Ill probably delete before you ban me
 Astrobytes: Someone really should confiscate your delete button struct
 struct: Maybe the sign up button would be a better choice
 Astrobytes: lol, good point
 reCurse: Or maybe find an alternative to get motivated :thinking:
 reCurse: But you do you
 UsamaIrfan: Whats everybody talking about?
 MadKnight: about Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: can u give me some help?
 Uljahn: UsamaIrfan: are you using an external client to enter the chat?
 Uljahn: lvl 1 wth
 tekki: what you want AUtomaton2000?
 Automaton2000: or just use the same code
 tekki: go ahead Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: is it possible to write a minimax
 tekki: ask recurse he's the boss Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: u can create a custom testcase for most puzzles
 Uljahn: oh that random guy was tekki i guess :smirk:
 Uljahn: i mean the lucky winner
 struct: What's minimax?
 Bob: it's a search algorithm
 Bob: typically adapted for 1v1 games where you try to max your own score and assume your opponent will try to min it
 Bob: hence the name
 6R1M__5P3C73R: f
 6R1M__5P3C73R: fdfd
 Uljahn: minimax is a search algorithm to keep struct distracted from deleting his accs, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if that's what you get
 Visual: why people dont want to share code in CoC&#160;:(especially evil python people
 Uljahn: maybe they don't want you to steal their evil secrets :imp:
 Moderateur_CondinGame: or maybe not
 Philbot: ^ fake mod
 Uljahn: he've changed his nick and ava already, fake news
 Philbot: fake cat
 Philbot: the bulls and cows cover picture only shows cows, no bulls
 MSmits: there are many more cows than bulls. It's probability
 Astrobytes: lol, good save
 reCurse: I call bull on that
 MSmits: allright, I admit I did not get good statistics on that
 MSmits: there may be some bull only farms I haven't visited
 Astrobytes: Are you in the habit of visiting bovine farming installations?
 MSmits: it's not really a habit, more of a... compulsion
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: This has crossed into "don't wanna know" territory real fast
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: you called bull, it's your fault
 MSmits: if you call bull, bull is what you're getting
 Astrobytes: Impeccable reasoning
 reCurse: I don't back down on calling bull
 reCurse: I'd rather take the bull by the horns
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 MSmits: wouldn't that be a moose  reCurse?
 reCurse: I don't know what mooses look like in netherlands
 reCurse: But here they don't have horns
 MSmits: well whatever that thing on their head is called in English :p
 Astrobytes: Antlers
 MSmits: ohh right
 Astrobytes: I'm not overly familiar with Canadian sayings but I'm guessing "take the moose by the antlers" isn't one of them...
 reCurse: Definitely not
 MSmits: hmm ok, i dont see why it wouldnt be
 MSmits: its a perfectly fine saying
 reCurse: Grip
 MSmits: you tried this then?
 reCurse: Do I need to try jumping off a bridge to guess at the results?
 MSmits: I don't know what you Canadians get up to
 reCurse: Fair enough
 MSmits: I am open to different cultures
 Astrobytes: Canadians aren't completely insane MSmits
 reCurse: Personally I hate people who are intolerant to other people's cultures
 MSmits: oh ok
 reCurse: And the Dutch
 MSmits: you hate people who are intolerant of the Dutch?
 Astrobytes: lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits you were right the other day about Uttt, I tried to loadin board combos into the ide and codesize errored my constant lookup table
 reCurse: Just my luck, you gave me the perfect setup and you don't know the reference
 MSmits: probably do know it if you point it out :P too much stuff in this head
 MSmits: lookups take too long
 MSmits: hash collisions and such
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcUs5X9glCc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcUs5X9glCc</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I compressed the data and then uncompressed into memory on 1st turn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and it worked
 MSmits: ahh yes,  i remember 
 Astrobytes: Smits won't have seen that, he prefers Disney movies reCurse :P
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII was this my advice?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was kind barking up the wrong tree it seems
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so i tell u you were right
 reCurse: Should have taken the moose by the antlers instead
 MSmits: i mean sure you can use lookup tables, just not too big of one
 Astrobytes: heh heh 
 MSmits: listen to reCurse, he's Canadian
 MSmits: they know this stuff
 reCurse: Think I need an avatar change
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i didn't take into account that boards could look like
 MSmits: not sure what your current one is from
 PatrickMcGinnisII: xxo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oox
 PatrickMcGinnisII: xxo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: bad example
 MSmits: why wouldnt you take that into account
 MSmits: also, you're gonna chase reCurse away
 MSmits: he has an allergy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the boards i stored didn't account for lets say 5 x's and 0 o's
 MSmits: you mean it only took into account rows of max 3?
 MSmits: oh, you mean ordinary TTT boards
 MSmits: with x and o being equal or x has +!
 MSmits: +1
 PatrickMcGinnisII: you got it
 MSmits: yeah there are many more than just those
 MSmits: 19863 if you use all possible ways to fill it with x, o and empty. Some of those are impossible though, most aren't
 MSmits: also about half of them are finished games
 MSmits: finished miniboards that is
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did recompute with those boards, but it encoded to a 7 length hex #
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so i tried encodeing into a base 62 #
 PatrickMcGinnisII: still codesized
 MSmits: you can also just calculate this in the first 1s. It is very quick
 MSmits: just fill it with a function
 MSmits: oh right, still php
 MSmits: should be doable with php too I think
 MSmits: you can just hardcode the first two moves... it's not like you need the calculation time for those moves
 PatrickMcGinnisII: now I'm trying base 88, the max safe string encoding ... so 4 chars per board x 19k boards should be nuder the codesize limit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: under
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it probably wont play perfect
 MSmits: probably not
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but it will meet 100ms / turn
 MSmits: I think you're going through a whole lot of trouble just to avoid switching to a different language&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just wanted to give u a headsup, i screwed up
 MSmits: sure
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup, its like a coding challenge within another challenge within a compete
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I just wanted to use my local computing power to boost a bots performance
 PatrickMcGinnisII: see if i can get a submit in this week
 PatrickMcGinnisII: chase recurse?  recurse, you male of female? lol j/l
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or
 PatrickMcGinnisII: j/k
 Astrobytes: No, he's allergic to UTTT
 Astrobytes: Or 'triggered' at least :P
 MSmits: I meant scare
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl, like my lil code is gonna threaten u guys in legend
 MSmits: no no, you dont understand. He really dislikes the game :P
 Astrobytes: A lot.
 Uljahn: php in legend would be awesome
 PatrickMcGinnisII: top in php is in gold
 MSmits: it was really hard to get legend with C#
 Astrobytes: C++ bot, PHP wrapper. Job done :smirk:
 Uljahn: you can just resubmit any language
 MSmits: true but thats cheating&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Yeah didn't they stop giving tshirts in comps for that?
 MSmits: I think so
 Uljahn: i guess php or python bot in uttt is to stretch your limits, also implementing bitboards, MCTS or minimax is a lot of experience despite the sim count
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: C#/java are also easy starting languages though
 MSmits: and still stretches
 MSmits: because you need to use bitboards to get to legend and optimize a lot
 MSmits: anyway, gonna go get some food. ttyl!
 miszu: I started uttt with java and the Garbage collector killed my performance. So I am making a C++ version but I am dealing with bunch of compiler error
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'[m giving CG COV-19
 miszu: We should make a competition where the AI is a virus and needs to spread
 Uljahn: looks like Skynet revolution puzzle
 wlesavo: Uljahn thx for the book about numpy btw
 Uljahn: yw
 struct: I have virus multi ready to release
 struct: But I dont think I can
 AntiSquid: maybe CG should have Pandemic game, 2 different viruses fighting to spread and to kill as many people as possible
 reCurse: All in great taste
 AntiSquid: it would be interesting
 AntiSquid: the theme could be easily changed obv and the game would still require same strategies, but the world is getting hypersensitive 
 AntiSquid: everything is offensive
 Astrobytes: viruses =&gt; fluffy kittens, kill as many people as possible =&gt; hug as many people as possible
 Astrobytes: Problem solved
 AntiSquid: should be fluffy snails to make it gender neutral
 AntiSquid: snails are the best
 reCurse: Don't think it's quite about hyper sensitivity to offensiveness but whatever
 reCurse: You do you
 AntiSquid: sure, thanks you too
 Batfly-injob: Hii! 
 Batfly-injob: Someone know, about defibrilator, what is the "single possibility" case&#160;?
 Batfly-injob: The results said this case d'ont work, but when I custom only one possibility, it's a success
 miszu: lol I thought you asked for a real defibrilator haha
 Batfly-injob: I will get an heart attack if I don't know why &gt;&lt;
 Batfly-injob: In fact, I used that custom for the single possibility: 3,87948343,60817711;Maison de la Prevention Sante;6 rue Maguelone 340000 Montpellier;000000;3,87952263361082;43,6071285339217
 miszu: I got you. In defibrilator there is a razor so I can shave your chest and gonna reanimate you
 miszu: #themoreyouknow
 Uljahn: have you read the discussions page?
 Batfly-injob: The test work with my code, but it seems the first validator use another parameter, but what?
 Uljahn: also that comma looks suspicious
 Batfly-injob: I wasn't change anything expect remove the other possibilities
 Batfly-injob: This is not the discussion page here? :s
 Uljahn: it's a tab on the landing page
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators/discuss">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/defibrillators/discuss</a>
 Batfly-injob: Oh, ok, it's the "forum" at the corner, sorry :s
 Astrobytes: Oh great, I gotta stay in my huse for 7 days&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: *house
 Batfly-injob: OK, I get it thx to the forum, thank you :D
 Uljahn: yw
 Uljahn: Astrobytes: quarantined?
 Astrobytes: Uljahn, yeah I've got 'flu, symptoms also match covid-19 so need to self-isolate
 reCurse: Does that include isolation from chat
 Astrobytes: No :P
 AntiSquid: why 7? i thought it's 14
 Astrobytes: No, as of 7 minutes ago:"if you have symptoms of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started"
 reCurse: I've heard 14 from a ton of sources
 Astrobytes: Not in UK
 AntiSquid: here in UK we do things the dodgy way
 Astrobytes: It has a 2-14 day incubation period though
 Astrobytes: Apparently in the UK we're about 4-weeks behind Italy, infection-wise
 AntiSquid: ya good things Boris doesn't want schools to close for 30 days, maybe we can catch up
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Most people haven't been taking it seriously so far, that's problematic.
 reCurse: Getting there though
 reCurse: Where I live they just banned all events that gather more than 250 people
 AntiSquid: all fun and games until ...
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Scotland banned events over 500 people as of Monday
 struct: o.o
 AntiSquid: at least local meetup groups were cancelled by the organizers even with just 30 people
 reCurse: We had a work party tonight too, cancelled
 AntiSquid: china claims they are recovering
 struct: Their number is too strange
 struct: Doesnt change
 reCurse: I wouldn't trust anything they say
 AntiSquid: maybe they took "care" of all the "patients"
 reCurse: Especially after trying to cover it up from the start
 Astrobytes: Quite.
 Astrobytes: They're currently pushing the idea that the virus is US in origin
 reCurse: kek
 struct: lol
 reCurse: Taking a page off Trump's book I see
 struct: Weird number also from russia
 struct: Doesnt change
 AntiSquid: i believe it if they bought it from US and played around with it
 struct: But both from countries that hide stuff from peopl+e
 struct: so Im not suprised
 tehHacker2000: are you all doing alright
 tehHacker2000: since, yeah the coronavirus is really bad
 tehHacker2000: and i'd hate for anyone ,even if i don't know them, get the coronavirus
 AntiSquid: which country doesn't hide stuff from people
 reCurse: I was waiting for the whataboutism
 PatrickMcGinnisII: little know fact:  Chinese rocket crashed on launch 3 weeks before first death
 tehHacker2000: when
 Astrobytes: DPRK hides nothing at all. Nope.
 AntiSquid: Kim Jung Un is immune
 Astrobytes: Little known fact: Most little known facts have nothing to do with anything :P
 AntiSquid: little no fact
 wlesavo: russia banned antiputin demonstrations because of corona, that is not even a joke
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well its just as valid as blaming US
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all propagaNDA
 Astrobytes: ofc Patrick
 AntiSquid: NSA
 reCurse: Yeah, as soon as something is bad, it's equal to all bads
 AntiSquid: done
 reCurse: It is known
 tehHacker2000: that's really stupid
 Astrobytes: lol wlesavo, any excuse eh
 tehHacker2000: no one should be getting blame for natures work
 AntiSquid: all the damage caused by the floods in UK are god's will then
 tehHacker2000: exactly
 tehHacker2000: or maybe it's just us overpopulating and the world is heating up causing more rainstorms
 reCurse: ...
 AntiSquid: yes global warming is good excuse to build on flood plains
 tehHacker2000:  idk, just my theory 
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, ofc. Short-term profits matter more than the long-term implications right?
 AntiSquid: what do you think of Sunak's flood of fundings Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, it can only be a good thing. Temporarily at least curbing the effect of Osborne's austerity programme. Whether it helps in the longer term remains to be seen
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the schools in florida are putting the lectures online now, k-12 is shutting down next week i think
 Astrobytes: It depends what measures he takes in the coming months
 tehHacker2000: hey AntiSquid, do you guys in  london have costco
 AntiSquid: wait . this reminds me of a joke someone told me 
 AntiSquid: it was about england having only one city: London
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII yeah, quite a few institutions in UK are doing that too
 tehHacker2000: b/ many people in the U.S are literally taking everthing as if there's a war or something
 Astrobytes: lol squiddy
 Astrobytes: London, Europe
 miszu: better be preventive early than too late
 tehHacker2000: cause were getting many alerts of the virus many are taking it like a life and death situation gossiping like 40yr old moms
 tehHacker2000: gotta go
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Last time I went to grocery store, i bought frozen pizza and toilet paper ... u know, the essentials
 Astrobytes: tehHacker2000, ofc there is a war. Trump said you're being invaded by a 'foreign virus'
 AntiSquid: there are costcos in London, i don't live there though
 miszu: the number we see are only ppl who went to hospital and got tested. Most people are just staying home and they never get tested. So the number are much higher
 Astrobytes: Yep.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Corona virus turns Tesco into skate parks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hungry, laterz
 Astrobytes: see ya
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-risk-of-reinfection-2020-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-risk-of-reinfection-2020-2?r=US&amp;IR=T</a>recovery doesn't make you immune apparantly 
 AntiSquid: apparently * Q_Q
 Elioh: some people that recovered got sick again from it
 Astrobytes: Sort-of, they're not sure if it's reinfection or if the virus itself is biphasic
 AntiSquid: EU to give migrants in Greece €2,000 to go home seriously 
 whip: hehehehe
 miszu: The wife's PM of Canada got corona as well
 miszu: well she is sick with same symptoms as corona
 Elioh: this sucks really 
 whip: wow so sad sadsad
 miszu: this is not Ebola guys. We got this
 Trollmen: it's a flu, you can get flu again
 Astrobytes: It's not a 'flu
 arkwaw: Its cheaper to give them 2k euro than to keep them here
 arkwaw: i guess
 MSmits: the virus has more in common with the common cold than the flu doesnt it?
 MSmits: except it's way worse
 MSmits: common cold actually being corona and other viruses
 reCurse: It really isn't about the virus symptoms as much as the propagation and crossing the breaking point of existing support like hospitales
 MSmits: and the flu being influenza... something completely different
 Astrobytes: there are some coronaviruses causing common cold yes, the similarity with influenza is how the disease presents itself
 MSmits: yes, people keep focusing on the fatality rate, which is already way worse than any other common virus
 MSmits: but the hospitalization rate is extreme
 Astrobytes: Plus it's novel
 reCurse: The resulting pressure on health care, supply chains and whatever else is the real concern here
 Astrobytes: And on the loose in the wild
 Astrobytes: yes reCurse
 MSmits: that and avoiding contact with vulnerable people
 miszu: thank god we are developers so human contact is limited haha
 AntiSquid: i like UK's solution, just hire more nurses and doctors (ignoring the higher cost of living)
 Astrobytes: Well, take my example. Myself and my mother care for my elderly grandfather who's got alzheimer's
 Astrobytes: I'm now quarantined, my mum has to take over all duties
 TheFlamingCastle_b738: Death rate isn't really high if we take iinto account that A LOT of people with it won't know they have it. Problem is the pressure on health care, as reCurse said
 MSmits: how does she know for sure she's not been infected Astrobytes&#160;?
 Astrobytes: She has to have contact with my grandad because there is no-one else to care for him
 Astrobytes: She doesn't
 MSmits: TheFlamingCastle_b738 the death rate is crazy high... 20 times higher than the flue. 
 MSmits: flu
 Astrobytes: The point being - there is nobody to care for him otherwise
 AntiSquid: there are people who are immune to it and carry it?
 Astrobytes: Essentially-speaking yes, same with most communicable infections
 reCurse: So I heard yeah
 MSmits: a bigger problem is people carrying it and not know they have it yet
 MSmits: not that many people immune atm
 Wilster: im immune
 Astrobytes: Some people just develop sniffles, or a headache
 Astrobytes: But are still infectious
 AntiSquid: and so is Kim Jung Un, Wilster what's your point?
 miszu: you can be asymptomatic and still be contagious
 MSmits: it's kinda strange for me. My prime minister just ordered a ban on all gatherings on events with more than 100 people
 miszu: same thing in Canada for 250+ ppl
 MSmits: but just today I took a test in a very small classroom with 30 students
 Trollmen: gather 99.break the system
 MSmits: which is arguably worse
 Astrobytes: Yep, between 100-500 people depending on country
 reCurse: It's not about consistency as much as limiting
 miszu: those measure is to reduce propagation so the health care doesn't get saturated
 reCurse: Canceling events is the easier thing to do for now
 reCurse: Up next will be schools and work places
 MSmits: just saying, the density of the people is probably more important than the amount of them
 Trollmen: ukrain closed schools
 reCurse: It's both
 AntiSquid: permanently
 miszu: of course density. When someone sneeze or cough, it radius of contamination is about 2m due to water droplets
 Astrobytes: Yes, 1 person can infect 2-3 others, proximity and density matters 
 AntiSquid: london subway
 MSmits: I also travel by public transport
 MSmits: probably not the best way to go 
 AntiSquid: 1 person can infect everyone else
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid, that's where I picked up H1N1
 AntiSquid: actually best example is the UK superspreader
 MSmits: Astrobytes do you keep a collection?
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Perhaps I should start
 reCurse: I thought storm chasing was a bit weird, but virus chasing dude?
 miszu: just don't put your fingers in your mouth, eyes and nose and wash your hands when you get home. You reduce drastically your chances
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: Jsut for clarification, I contracted H1N1 via London subway lol
 miszu: how bad was your symptoms?
 Astrobytes: It was f*king horrible. Worst 'flu I had by far
 MSmits: that had a lower fatality than corona I think, didnt it?
 Astrobytes: I got sent home from the restaurant as I almost passed out in the kitchen
 Astrobytes: Yes MSmits, only SARS + MERS are higher iirc
 miszu: I remember the H1N1 when I was in high school. They rushed students to get vaccine. Then next day those ppl got sick because of vaccine side effect
 AntiSquid: interesting&#160;:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/grows-virus-cell-culture.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/grows-virus-cell-culture.html</a>
 Astrobytes: Happens, but usually not as severe as actually contracting it
 Astrobytes: What's interesting AntiSquid?
 MSmits: AntiSquid thinks the CDC is weaponizing it
 AntiSquid: that's not what the article says
 Astrobytes: lol, if we never cultured the pathogens we encounter how would we learn anything?
 MSmits: I know :P
 MSmits: at work I put my food next to the cultured pathogens my biology colleages keep in the fridge
 Astrobytes: Their old sandwiches? :P
 MSmits: no, actual petri dish stuff
 Astrobytes: wtf
 MSmits: there's at least 10 cm. between my food and it, no worries
 Astrobytes: Dude
 MSmits: well they're not actually allowed to grow dangerous bacteria :P
 MSmits: at least those ones, you can see
 Astrobytes: It's easy to accidentaly grow dangerous bacteria, moulds and fungi
 Astrobytes: *accidentally
 MSmits: also, I drink from what is basically a giant baby bottle
 MSmits: which is my food :P
 reCurse: TIL the less I know about MSmits the better
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: hey, this is real coder stuff
 Astrobytes: Bovine fetish, baby bottles, bacterial lunches
 MSmits: this way of consuming food was invented by coders
 Astrobytes: ALADDIN
 MSmits: to be able to spend more time coding
 Trollmen: can somebody point me in the right directing with horse-racing duels - easy puzzle?
 Trollmen: no idea how to do it with 1 iteration

 AntiSquid: MSmits is an Anatomy Park, like the santa from Rick and Morty?
 reCurse: Oh dear
 MSmits: define anatomy park
 miszu: Do you want the Aladdin news or the Aladdin news?

 MSmits: which incidentally, also features Naomi Scott who sang that great song speechless.... go listen

 Astrobytes: So you just have a thing for Naomi Scott then MSmits? :D
 MSmits: just that song :P
 Astrobytes: But... Power Rangers
 reCurse: I think this chat needs a quarantine
 MSmits: hey, there wasnt anything else on netflix
 Astrobytes: "wasnt anything else on netflix" featuring Naomi Scott?
 MSmits: reCurse be open to new experiences
 MSmits: that too Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: If nothing else, it's keeping my spirits up
 MSmits: yeah, it must suck for you to be forced to stay home like that
 MSmits: especially with having to care for family
 Astrobytes: It wouldn't suck so much if I felt OK
 MSmits: for me, it would just be the same as always, basically
 MSmits: oh you actually have the virus for sure?
 Astrobytes: Not for sure no, but I was told that the symptoms match therefore I must quarantine
 AntiSquid: you have time to fix your bot Astrobytes
 MSmits: ah I see
 Astrobytes: Trying AntiSquid, in between lying down 
 AntiSquid: MadKnightMachine_6af9 imagine getting into self isolation just to fix your CSB
 MSmits: well if they are flu symptoms... flu is a lot less common than the common cold is, right?
 Astrobytes: It's 'flu season
 MSmits: yeah, but the real influenza, dont you contract that like once every 5 years or so?
 MSmits: much more rare than the common cold
 MSmits: or diarrhea from noro virus or similar, you get that more often also
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I last had proper 'flu in... a few years ago
 AntiSquid: last i had to call of sick was &gt;5 years ago
 Astrobytes: But you can contract 'flu every year technically
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: I have no problem calling in sick with the common cold
 MSmits: you're doing everyone a favor
 Astrobytes: Try cheffing MSmits, unless you're collapsing or dead you don't get a day off
 reCurse: Not many employers are that... progressive?
 MSmits: i *really* dont want my chef to have a common cold
 Astrobytes: Never go out and eat
 reCurse: It's definitely not about what you want
 MSmits: just reiterating the favor part&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: In an ideal world, it would be like that
 MSmits: as a teacher, i'm the only one who has a real problem when i stay home with a cold
 MSmits: I'm supposed to make sure the students can keep learning
 reCurse: One might even say you spark joy whenever you do
 MSmits: and noone replaces me
 MSmits: mostly yes, reCurse
 Astrobytes: haha
 Astrobytes: You don't have supply/agency teachers as backup?
 MSmits: sometimes students panic when it takes too long
 MSmits: not for a few weeks no
 MSmits: only when it takes months
 Astrobytes: So the students just don't have your class at all?
 MSmits: they have books, a plan, I have an e-mail adress
 MSmits: thats about it
 AntiSquid: MSmits best to cook your own food at home, even if no chef has cold
 MSmits: orrr... put powder in a bottle and add water, like I do
 reCurse: Ignorance is bliss
 Astrobytes: it's not Huel or something MSmits
 MSmits: something like that, I tried Huel, it was horrible
 Astrobytes: It's called 'Huel' for a reason
 MSmits: not sure what it means, but it doesnt sound too good no
 Astrobytes: The sound you make as it leaves your stomach again
 MSmits: lol

 Zenoscave: no
 reCurse: Yeah or you fucked something up real bad
 MSmits: why would the signal be ill?
 Zenoscave: hm
 MSmits: corona?
 Zenoscave: lmao
 reCurse: illegal instruction
 struct: just run from AVX
 Astrobytes: illegal MSmits
 MSmits: o
 Zenoscave: cpuinfo the only way to see instruction sets?
 reCurse: Dunno about the only way
 reCurse: It's one
 Zenoscave: ok thank you
 struct: what function are you trying zeno?
 Zenoscave: _mm256_set1_epi16
 reCurse: There's cpuid but it's a bit arcane
 struct: what cpu you have?
 Zenoscave: the CG ones XD
 reCurse: Multi or optim/puzzle
 Zenoscave: optim
 reCurse: Optim might be limited to AVX1
 Astrobytes: Are they on different machines?
 reCurse: Yes
 reCurse: Used to at least
 reCurse: Dunno if they changed
 Astrobytes: I see
 Zenoscave: cpuinfo says avx2...
 reCurse: Ok so you fucked up
 reCurse: Grats
 Zenoscave: Thank!!!!
 struct: did you enable avx2?
 Zenoscave: -mavx2 right?
 struct: #pragma GCC target("avx2")
 Zenoscave: yeah
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fc48520-db25-4c6d-ac97-6cec38a0b065">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2fc48520-db25-4c6d-ac97-6cec38a0b065</a>
 Zenoscave: the avx512vl/bw is a different problem probably I'll fix later
 Astrobytes: Waiiiit you can execute that on CG?
 Zenoscave: why wouldn't you?
 Astrobytes: It never occurred to me, frankly
 Zenoscave: well there ou go
 reCurse: Don't you have to include some header
 Zenoscave: yeah i ellided that
 struct: 
 struct: lol
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f558780-c005-4ffb-8865-7573110db7c9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/9f558780-c005-4ffb-8865-7573110db7c9</a>
 reCurse: Don't enable avx512
 reCurse: That's probably why you're having trouble
 Zenoscave: ok Ill try that
 MSmits: oh yea, it doesnt have 512 registers right?
 MSmits: 256 max
 struct: yes only avx2
 struct: so 8 floats or 4 doubles max
 reCurse: That has nothing to do with registers
 reCurse: Unless you meant 512 bits
 reCurse: Well I guess you did
 reCurse: You're not *that* weird :P
 MSmits: I'm quite weird, but i did mean 512 bits
 struct: You should try it MSmits
 struct: I think you will enjoy it
 MSmits: I did
 struct: when?
 reCurse: Just need to pay the few thousand $ premium
 MSmits: the problem is not my lack of getting it to work, it's the creativity required to improve something with it
 MSmits: so far I have only heard it improving bots with physics sims, running several in parallel
 MSmits: I would love to see example code and steal this
 MSmits: struct I used it to calculate UCB inverse square roots in parallel
 MSmits: but the loading overhead was too large
 reCurse: I'd really like AVX512 it has nice NN instructions
 MSmits: matrix multiplication?
 dbdr: will AVX512 end up in general CPUs in a few years?
 reCurse: Don't think so
 reCurse: It's too big
 dbdr: or it's more for specialized hardware?
 reCurse: And AI has moved away from CPUs
 reCurse: Well deep learning anyway
 MSmits: seems so hard to code anything on a gpu
 dbdr: IIRC, AVX512 is very modular too, lost of separate features
 reCurse: Yeah but it's already a pain dealing with SSE vs AVX
 miszu: tenserflow ftw
 reCurse: And supporting all the different codes
 reCurse: Nah tf sucks
 MSmits: AVX is easier to code than a gpu. Unless my experience with unity compute shaders doesnt represent gpu coding properly
 reCurse: Well it is easier because you're still in a general computing framework
 reCurse: Obviously
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: it's weird, you're basically feeding images into a gpu
 MSmits: as input
 reCurse: vectors of numbers
 MSmits: yes, but they use the same data types that are used for images, pixel shaders and such
 reCurse: Oh you meant compute shaders
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: mb
 reCurse: It's a hack but a good one
 reCurse: Since there's no standard for gpgpu
 reCurse: Unless you count "everyone buy nvidia" as one
 dbdr: openCL?
 MSmits: I also did a bunch of vertex/pixel shader tutorials, but it seems horrible to code anything for gpu. Worst is the backward compatibility. You put code in there barely understanding why, because otherwise it breaks something noone remembers
 reCurse: OpenCL is not used seriously by anyone unless I'm mistaken
 dbdr: that's also what I read
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/816004c8-be5e-4d10-b175-607108f0671a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/816004c8-be5e-4d10-b175-607108f0671a</a>
 dbdr: looks impressive
 dbdr: so the question is why it's not used
 reCurse: It's complicated
 dbdr: maybe it works but you get less performance
 reCurse: But the bottom line is nvidia put a lot of money to be the most attractive by far
 reCurse: In terms of performance, lilbraries, support, you name it
 dbdr: sure, they benefit from locking people in
 reCurse: So OpenCL never got enough attention to get traction
 reCurse: That and standardizing implementation of high performance is a bit hard
 dbdr: always sad to see lockin instead of a standard with healthy competition
 reCurse: But I'm no expert so take that with a huge grain of salt
 Astrobytes: Do nvidia officially support linux yet? (I'm a bit behind)
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: Closed source but they have drivers
 Astrobytes: Progress at least I suppose
 reCurse: They pulled out of macos world though
 reCurse: Mostly thanks to apple though nvidia is no angel
 Astrobytes: Quite
 dbdr: obligatory <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ</a>&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol
 reCurse: Is there anything or anyone linus has not said fuck you to
 reCurse: It loses impact after a bit
 Astrobytes: Users, devs, manufacturers... yep
 dbdr: this one is famous
 Astrobytes: All his fuck you's are famous
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: which other ones?
 AntiSquid: so did they eventually get laid?
 Astrobytes: Didn't he at least admit to being an arsehole at some point in the last few years?
 reCurse: Yeah but that it was necessary yada yada
 Astrobytes: Or something along those lines
 reCurse: A non-apology if I've seen one
 dbdr: well, he's also know to be rude to some people who contribute code he thinks is crap
 AntiSquid: that's what the D community does a lot
 dbdr: but he also made a point that's better than to be polite and let your code become infected
 reCurse: That's such a strawman
 reCurse: Anyway
 dbdr: I don't like that style. but I also don't think it's purely straman
 reCurse: Because obviously those are the only two options
 reCurse: Be an asshole and have good code, be nice and have shitty code
 reCurse: :rolling_eyes:
 dbdr: agreed, there's a continuum
 Astrobytes: Linus will always divide opinion, I think he likes it and is quite deliberate 
 reCurse: He just enjoys being an asshole
 reCurse: No need to excuse it
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's it distilled
 dbdr: like many things, it can be also that there is a "media" focus on the most extreme cases. which are real for sure. but might give a distorted view too.
 dbdr: “I want to apologize to the people that my personal behavior hurt and  possibly drove away from kernel development entirely,” he wrote in a  letter posted to&#160;a Linux forum &lt;<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/16/167">https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/16/167</a>&gt;. “I am going to take time off and get some assistance on how to understand people’s emotions and respond appropriately.”
 dbdr: that's what astrobytes referred to I guess
 MSmits: why would you be driven away by that
 reCurse: That sounds cooked up
 Astrobytes: Yep dbdr
 MSmits: it's not like he's the first guy in that line of work to be insensitive to other people's feelings :P
 AntiSquid: uhm Bill Gates was super rude to his employees ...
 reCurse: Oh ok it's all good then
 AntiSquid: it's non news
 dbdr: reCurse: it's in the eye of the beholder I guess
 reCurse: Rather amused&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: When I was first intro'd to linux back in 2000/2001-ish my tech lead told me Linus was "somewhere between genius and massive knob-end"
 dbdr: why not both?
 dbdr: people are complex
 AntiSquid: like flowers with thorns 
 Astrobytes: Hence the "somewhere between"
 Astrobytes: Uncertainty principle and all that
 Astrobytes: :P
 Astrobytes: You can't measure knob-endianness and genius at the same time
 dbdr: is there big and little-knob-endianness?&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: lol of course
 AntiSquid: knob-leaderboard :thinking:
 dbdr: TIL Neil Armstrong is contributing to the kernel<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/2/255">https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/2/255</a>

 Astrobytes: lol, even got some 'space' in there too
 dbdr: true :D
 dbdr: maybe it was B&amp;W in 1969, but it's in color now
 Astrobytes: Neil discovered something when in space you see

 dbdr: indeed
 Astrobytes: Peep Show was even better imo
 MSmits: first singer-songwriter on the moon&#160;:)
 Zenoscave: I fixed it. turns out I was using avx512 instructions and those aren't quite available on CG lol
 Zenoscave: thanks recurse
 reCurse:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: man,  I didnt understand most of what you guys discussed, but that was pretty much the only thing i already knew :P
 MSmits: coulda asked me :P
 Zenoscave: Thanks retroactively Msmits!
 MSmits: lol
 struct: Dont use FMA instructions aswell

 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide">https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide</a>
 Zenoscave: been using this to see what was available
 Astrobytes: *retrospectively I believe (sorry)
 Zenoscave: could be
 MSmits: how can you be sure Astrobytes, you have the flu
 MSmits: your brain is whacky
 Astrobytes: Retroactively means you enact something at a past date
 reCurse: There's nothing wrong with fma
 reCurse: What are you talking about
 MSmits: is it time travel Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Shut it Aladdin :D
 MSmits: I won't be speechless :musical_note:
 MSmits: :notes: speechless! :notes:
 reCurse: Is that a challenge?
 MSmits: i am just badly reciting lyrics from a song
 Zenoscave: what's wrong with Full Metal Alchemist?
 Astrobytes: MSmits likes Disney songs
 MSmits: just 1!
 MSmits: though, i like some from the lion king
 Astrobytes: You've done it now man
 Astrobytes: OH
 MSmits: full metal alchemist was ok too, the movie on netflix that is
 Astrobytes: I had a crazy dream a few weeks back that culminated in me wandering in some garage/basement holding what can only be described as a monkfish mouth, which was singing "Can You Feel The Love Tonight"
 Astrobytes: @MSmits re Lion King
 MSmits: was this before you had the virus?
 Astrobytes: Yup
 MSmits: then I got nuthin'
 MSmits: love that song though
 Astrobytes: I know. Neither do, nor did I.
 MSmits: must be elton john... noone else
 Astrobytes: Jeez man you're beyond help
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: probably 
 Astrobytes: Fun fact:. "Kings and vagabonds" - my sister had hearing issues as a child and sang "Kings and Dragamons"
 MSmits: sounds better
 MSmits: btw, I am still fitting oware params
 Astrobytes: I'm just failing
 MSmits: still insane how sensitive these params are
 reCurse:  /ban MSbits
 MSmits: I found a set that beats recurse, agade and robo
 MSmits: the new versions
 MSmits: but it gets slaughtered by my old bot =/
 Astrobytes: And no one else right?
 Astrobytes: It's bonkers
 MSmits: yeah it is
 Astrobytes: brb
 reCurse: I'm adressing exploitation next
 MSmits: i wouldnt say it's overfitted when it beats 3 separate NN's
 reCurse: Your shenanigan days are over soon
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: there's always a new shenanigan around the corner
 MSmits: what does exploitation do?
 reCurse: fwiw I have around 30 versions that may or may not respond better to your shenanigans
 reCurse: Try me
 MSmits: and how would oyu adress it?
 MSmits: that will be interesting reCurse
 reCurse: Classified info
 MSmits: oh ok, this is not common knowledge?
 MSmits: my guess is that you are talking about some NN technique to remove bad flaws in the network that dont appear during training
 MSmits: but can be exploited
 MSmits: by a different kind of bot
 reCurse: I'm talking about exploitation in the game theory sense
 MSmits: so you would have to introduce some more randomness, the same kind you need to reduce overtraining?
 reCurse: :zipper_mouth:
 MSmits: haha, dont worry, it's not like I can use the information. It's purely academic interest&#160;:)
 struct: I thought fma did not work on CG cpu
 struct: my bad
 MSmits: you'll find this interesting reCurse
 struct: Now I see it does
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/oFBsSlk">https://imgur.com/a/oFBsSlk</a>
 MSmits: parameter winrate
 MSmits: added up: you + robo + agade
 MSmits: see how sensitive it is
 reCurse: Somehow not overfitting :thinking:
 MSmits: well vs 3 NNs...
 MSmits: its hard to overfit vs 3 separate bots isnt it?
 reCurse: Not necessarily?
 reCurse: You're talking about 3 bots that trained with more or less the same technique
 MSmits: all versions of my bot had very different winrates vs your bots though, sometimes it won 0 vs Robo and 40 against you, sometimes the other way around
 darkhorse64: &gt; If I have correctlyHave you considered doing shallow
 MSmits: but sure, i guess if you try enough combinations...
 darkhorse64: oops
 Astrobytes: broken ankle again darkhorse64?&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: Have you considered doing shallow minimax instead of evaluating nodes&#160;?
 MSmits: me?
 AntiSquid: shallow ingrown toe nail
 darkhorse64: Astrobytes&#160;: :stuck_out_tongue:
 darkhorse64: MSmits: yes
 MSmits: mmh
 MSmits: how does that work
 darkhorse64: When you expand, you eval all child nodes, go one or two stages further à la minimax
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: sounds very expensive though
 Astrobytes: The tradeoff might be worth it 
 MSmits: would you then backprop 1 value or several?
 reCurse:&#160;??
 Astrobytes: Only one?
 MSmits: I mean... when i do an expansion now, I backprop each child
 MSmits: added up
 Astrobytes: Oh do you mean cumulative from whatever depth
 darkhorse64: I have tried that with my poor eval: the bot was slightly weaker but the number of visited nodes grew to 8M first turn with depth 1 minimax
 reCurse: You don't touch your tree
 Astrobytes: ahhh the minimax is your eval score 
 MSmits: darkhorse64, you eval each child as well dont you? I mean without the minimax?
 MSmits: and then back prop the total value?
 MSmits: divided by the number of children?
 MSmits: or am I doing that wrong
 darkhorse64: Yes total value, and visits = number of nodes
 MSmits: ok but with the minimax that is different?
 Astrobytes: that's the score you backprop
 Astrobytes: if I'm not mistaken
 MSmits: yes but it's not 6 scores then?
 MSmits: or is it no longer mcts?
 MSmits: are you doing a best first kind of minimax?
 MSmits: :confused:
 Astrobytes: (I'm just guessing, I've only ever read about this)
 darkhorse64: I have not played a lot with this idea mainly because my eval is not good. May be true minimax is better or just expansion with full backprop. Don't know but the number of explored nodes increase a lot and there may be something to gain from it
 MSmits: hmm but why do the amount of explored nodes increase?
 darkhorse64: You skip costly UCB
 MSmits: right so, it's a full minimax tree?
 MSmits: except it's best first?
 darkhorse64: Actually, the UCB directs you to a group of nodes to explore not only at depth 0 but at 1 or 2
 Zenoscave: I'm 1 Point behind marchet
 MSmits: ahh ok, so you spend much more time in a branch
 MSmits: less selection happening
 darkhorse64: Yes. Once again, I have no proof that it works but it looks interestig
 MSmits: what do you put on the nodes? Is this the minimax score? How does the minimax score turn into regular ucb score
 darkhorse64: *interesting*
 MSmits: no i am very interested
 Astrobytes: Guess some scaling is involved
 Astrobytes: There's a few papers out there on it iirc, but don't take my virus-addled word for it :P
 MSmits: yeah, I've seen some stuff like that, but not exactly that
 darkhorse64: I put the scores at depth 1, the combined scores at depth 0, true back propagation. My reasoning is that I may explore further these nodes and I want to build my tree like MCTS does. That may be wrong
 MSmits: yeah.. who knows
 MSmits: it may depend on the game also
 Astrobytes: Usually does it seems
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: I have 5 MCTS bots, each has a different flavor
 MSmits: mine are all different too
 MSmits: do you use 0 and 1 for players or -1 and 1
 MSmits: I like -1 and 1 for score multiplication but 0 and 1 for arrays
 MSmits: win loss are always 1 and -1 for me
 darkhorse64: 0, 1 for players, -1,0,1 for scores. I forgot to say that I use also eval scaled and clamped to 1
 MSmits: ah same as I do in oware
 MSmits: if this submit doesnt reach 1 I'll stop.  reCurse is gonna submit a different version anyway. He's probably got several that beat my bot
 MSmits: just wanna end 2&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: for my shallow expansion. My current bot is still &gt; 0 = Win with early playout termination
 MSmits:&#160;?
 MSmits: what is &gt; 0 =&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Sorry. If eval &gt; 0, count a win, etc ...
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: it improved mine when i changed
 MSmits: but I really dont trust any parameter fit anymore
 MSmits: I just test it vs the NN's and then it wins :P
 MSmits: but reCurse is right, might just be an overfitting artefact...
 darkhorse64: I remember you shortened rollouts when your eval improved. So it's not EPT anymore, shallow minimax is a natural extension on what you are doing 
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: it is kind of wasteful to go all the way down the tree and then not do very much&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: Great! You push me and you lower the NNs. reCurse is going to think we are teaming
 MSmits: you're welcome&#160;:)
 MSmits: I was worried it would do badly against bots other than the nn's but it does ok
 MSmits: I can keep it
 Astrobytes: very nice MSmits
 MSmits: sure, but if reCurse is right, it is also a bit cheesy maybe. I suspect that if any of you guys do a chain submit, it will leave reCurse mostly untouched and pull me back down
 MSmits: his bot is more versatile
 darkhorse64: For what I see, your winrate against me has decreased (from nearly 100&#160;% to 80%)
 Astrobytes: I'll see how many I can squeeze in tonight
 MSmits: too litle statistics though darkhorse64
 darkhorse64: Possibly but I see more wins from me in this submit than in the 10 previous ones
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits</a>
 darkhorse64: combined
 MSmits: you might be right
 MSmits: this is also why it lost to my previous bot
 MSmits: you can tell from the win&#160;% that i trained vs the NN's :P
 MSmits: it's kind of cool that this is even possible though 
 MSmits: gonna try to orthogonalize some params
 MSmits: try to make them less dependent on eachother, reduces the effect of overtraining, local minima and such maybe
 MSmits: for example, kroo params grow with seedcount but I also have  a seedcount param
 MSmits: there should only be 1 of them growing
 darkhorse64: Is that something you can really control&#160;?
 OualiMaher: what you say 
 MSmits: well my kroo thingy is basically a growing periodic function
 MSmits: I want to make it just periodic and put the growing into the seedcount
 MSmits: eliminate 1 para
 MSmits: +m
 MSmits: so a fixed amplitude periodic function for the kroo, then a different param to give more score for higher seedcount
 darkhorse64: growing with the #seeds in the kroo&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 AntiSquid: MSmits how come you second with that win rate?
 MSmits: re curse had a lead
 MSmits: not enough games in a single submit
 AntiSquid: resub?
 MSmits: already did twice, pulled him down a little
 AntiSquid: if you keep getting 70% you should get 1st no?
 darkhorse64: periodic because a kroo that reaches the opponent side has more value
 MSmits: but i dont chain submit unless it's deserved
 AntiSquid: 70% win rate = deserved imo
 MSmits: right now it's only deserved because I beat him after overtraining vs the nns. I do much worse than the nns versus the others
 MSmits: so any of them submitting would pull me back down
 MSmits: it's pointless
 AntiSquid: pull you down how?
 MSmits: by losing all battles vs re curse and winning 20% vs me
 Astrobytes: Losing against the NN's with occasional wins agains Smits
 Astrobytes: o beat me to it
 MSmits: and another thing, i am probably just 70% vs this particular version of re curses bot
 MSmits: and probably 30% vs another
 MSmits: he can just submit a different one
 AntiSquid: how do you know who even has a diff one?
 MSmits: he just said he has 30 versions
 MSmits: they take half an hour to train
 AntiSquid: lol
 darkhorse64: One for each core
 MSmits: it takes days for me to fnd the right params to beat one of his versions :P
 AntiSquid: 30 sounds redundant .
 AntiSquid: overredundant
 MSmits: if I want a permanent place on the nr 1, i could always go the book-route
 MSmits: but I dont feel like it atm
 AntiSquid: ugh just do it
 MSmits: it takes a week to write the code
 AntiSquid: it's the only way
 MSmits: then another week or two to even get a good enough book
 AntiSquid: it's your destiny MSmits, do it
 MSmits: all the while I lose precious calc time I need to beat karliso at uttt&#160;:)
 MSmits: I still win 45%&#160;:(
 MSmits: moar games!
 MSmits: Games played: 1,328,015 Nodes created: 3,068,857
 AntiSquid: how come karliso always seem to wreck everyone else really badly?
 MSmits: no idea, but he doesnt wreck me really badly
 MSmits: he wrecks me a lil'
 MSmits: he does have some weird opening book scheme that goes really deep in some branches and not at all in others
 MSmits: I just do an exploration 2 wide search, not countering anyone
 MSmits: I suppose i could just take his bot, note his starting sequence and counter that... but that's a temporary fix
 MSmits: he can just run his own program for a day and end up with a new starting sequence
 MSmits: nope... all i can do is... moar games!
 reCurse: :unamused:
 MSmits: hey, be glad, I am not doing this on oware :p
 reCurse: In a way you already are
 MSmits: really.. I am just messing with 10 parameters
 MSmits: you have thousands :P
 Astrobytes: I think the end result is the same, or similar rather
 MSmits: also the opening book thing is not overfitting if you just keep it to a single parameter
 MSmits: (exploration)
 MSmits: and not counter anyone specific
 MSmits: currently for uttt, that is what I do
 MSmits: a NN is similar in that regard, it just tries to counter any "good" bot, not a specific bot. 
 MSmits: you're right that what i did with oware is a bit different. I was really just picking the only 3 bots that had any chance vs mine and use that as a reference. If there were more bots, I'd add them to the list. But yeah  I guess that made it overfit =/
 reCurse: Well I guess it's either I run a batch of random versions until I find an overfit too
 reCurse: Or I finish my new training
 reCurse: Or both
 MSmits: I'm redoing my parameter setup to make it less vulnerable to overfitting. I really do prefer to have a bot that's strong overall
 reCurse: As long as your baseline is batching against my bot and robo's it will overfit
 MSmits: I added darkhorse now 
 reCurse: shrug
 MSmits: dunno what else to do
 MSmits: its gonna be worse if i play against myself
 MSmits: how should i fit params otherwise?
 reCurse: With 10 parameters yeah
 darkhorse64: I'm proud to be your sparring partner
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 MSmits: btw it's also Agade
 MSmits: so 4 bots
 reCurse: There's only 2 bots that matter
 reCurse: And you know it
 MSmits: I added him to reduce overfitting and because some of my versions lost a lot of games vs him
 MSmits: the most typical result would be 70% winrate vs Agade, 40-50% vs you and somewhere between 40 and 70% vs Robo
 MSmits: actually no, between 20 and 70... I overfit the most vs him I think
 MSmits: but reCurse, there is no need to bother with submitting a new bot. you'll remain at 1
 MSmits: at least, I wont spam this one more than the two submits I just did
 MSmits: I will try another if I succeed in creating one with 2 less params in total that are also more orthogonal. it's an experiment. 
 MSmits: or maybe if i try darkhorse64's minimax idea
 AguliRojo: How do i start it? I cannot wrap my hand around it to do any simple command
 MadKnight: AguliRojo
 MadKnight: start what?
 Z_Doctor: I think you learn the basics of a language and you use this site to practice what you learned
 HungryBurger: Indeed, that's about what I tell others.
 HungryBurger: Ironically, I always credit CodinGame for "helping me learn Python" in the sense of "giving me so many opportunities to practice Python that I was able to teach myself".
 miszu: Question for C++, why there is no core dump or error when your program has issue?

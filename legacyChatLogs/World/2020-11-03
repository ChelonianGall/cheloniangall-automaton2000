 Tenlamb: hi
 Pranit: how to solve the power of thori am new to this codin gamehow to use ithow to learn  before solving the problem
 Tumble89: hi, im stuck on this question
 Tumble89: how to count the total volume of water in a given matrix when it rain?
 KiwiTae: Pranit solve it on paper then implement your solution
 KiwiTae: if it doesnt work debug
 KiwiTae: Tumble89 just need to take the red pill
 STINZBI: i agree
 Majeck: It's 4AM where I live
 Majeck: And it's a school night
 _Programmer_: msg moralesmx
 Majeck: Buuuuuuuuut
 Majeck: I finished Mars Lander Ep 3
 Majeck: All I need to do now is hit submit
 Majeck: And I'll hit level 20
 Majeck: Have completed my first "Very Hard" puzzle
 Majeck: And be complete
 Majeck: But I'll leave being complete for the me of tomorrow
 Majeck: I want to see if having this incomplete will lead to me having nightmares
 dan.b: how's it going guys
 dan.b: lol there's a new quest map thing
 dan.b: levelled up twice from it
 Newoobie: hi guys 
 _O-MEGA: hello
 Newoobie: im very new to programming

 Lumie31: Hello everyone, I got a technical assessment from a company and the link points to CodinGame... Honestly, this is my first time hearing about this platform and I'd like to know if anyone has experience with interviews on this platform? Thanks in advance
 Uljahn: Lumie31: i guess you can visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/work/">https://www.codingame.com/work/</a>to learn more about assessments on CG
 Lumie31: Thank you so much @Uljahn
 Majeck: I can know say that I have lived a successful life
 Majeck: 100% Mars Lander Ep3
 Majeck: I am now complete
 Scarfield: nice, GA?
 Majeck: Nope
 Majeck: Didn't want to make a simulation
 Noisewerk: Lmao wished my coding tests were here
 Scarfield: how then&#160;:)&#160;? a sim for mars lander is not that bad, if you need help with the physics part, chat will help&#160;:)
 Noisewerk: Btw is there any chance all the '#include' for C++ can not be counted for CoC Shortest Mode?
 Lumie31: @Noisewerk How do you mean?
 Noisewerk: Perhaps even 'suing namespace std'
 Scarfield: sue them xD
 Noisewerk: lol obv meant 'using'
 Scarfield: :p
 Noisewerk: It's impossible to win Shortest mode in C++ unless you are the only one who got 100% or everyone else is using C++ too
 TobiasA: how do i change the direction vector of a pod in csb
 Scarfield: your pod will point towards your output; "x y thrust" but only turn a maximum of 18deg per turn though
 TobiasA: ok
 Eitvydas: Anyone else doing this for their programing lessons in high school? :D
 darkhorse64: Noisewerk: from my limited experience in CoC, many of them are "inspired" by Python capabilities. If you want to perform here, learn Python.

 darkhorse64: CG chat etiquette is that you should not post CoC invites here
 Astrobytes: Yep, post in #clash instead
 Astrobytes: And Noisewerk: if you insist on using C++ for shortest (which as darkhorse says is somewhat ill-advised) #import is shorter than #include
 Astrobytes: also "suing namespace std" :D
 Scarfield: its the american way! suestrBytes
 Astrobytes: lol stdfield
 Astrobytes: Oh my, what is this crazy new fencing multiplayer in Contributions
 LastRick: wow
 Astrobytes: Original concept for sure
 LastRick: Looks like Pitfall with a lightsaber
 Astrobytes: hahaha, you're not wrong

 Astrobytes: Putra: please post clash links in #clash
 VizGhar: Woah&#160;:) Love this platform. I'll create some multiplayer for sure. Any ideas where to get nice (idealy free) sprites of any kind?
 Astrobytes: Sounds like a job for a search engine&#160;;)I'm not sure where the best source is tbh, perhaps someone else knows a good one
 VizGhar: sounds fair&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: there's some in the SDK<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-sdk-assets">https://github.com/CodinGame/codingame-sdk-assets</a>

 Astrobytes: that's on the SDK assets page jacek
 jacek: oh?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, "External Resources" section, quite a few sources on there now
 VizGhar: Hope I can come up with some good concept this month&#160;:) quite hard to find free time
 Astrobytes: There's no rush, the SDK will be waiting for you when you're ready!
 jacek: also, come up with something after the contest
 Astrobytes: ^good point
 TheNinja811: hi im new
 _Programmer_: Hello
 eulerscheZahl: a fencing game, interesting
 Astrobytes: not overly interesting in its current state tbh
 eulerscheZahl: then i'll keep waiting for the contest
 eulerscheZahl: hopefully no fog
 jacek: fencing?
 Astrobytes: We shall see. Or won't see due to the fog I guess...
 Astrobytes: jacek:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5638cd2b181128c321c5e5ca1e7cf76ce9b0">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5638cd2b181128c321c5e5ca1e7cf76ce9b0</a>
 jacek: w00t
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: ayyyy yooooo
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: play the penguins instead
 jacek: hes windows guy
 Noisewerk: @Astrobytes Definitely C++ is not the way to go in CoC in general, but would be cool if it were more balanced against other languages 
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: can you hear me?
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: can you see my messages 
 Astrobytes: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i still hope to get a good idea for the topcoder contest
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: omd 
 eulerscheZahl: slowly dropping&#160;:(
 Noisewerk: Also yeah, import is shorter than include but I obv meant the whole #include &lt;iostream&gt; and all
 Noisewerk: Hastag include ftw
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: yo im forced to go on this website, im at school 
 darkhorse64: A windows guy bashing penguins ...
 Astrobytes: Noisewerk: just the way it is unfortunately.Can you use bits/stdc++.h on CG?
 eulerscheZahl: who here is a Windows guy @darkhorse64?
 Noisewerk: Yes you can, but still counts as 13 extra chars compared to Python where you go straight to coding
 darkhorse64: dunno: see jacek Â¨
 darkhorse64: ^
 TheNinja811: im new
 Noisewerk: I don't mind not winning shortest, but again would make it more of an actual challenge against other languages. Also considering that anything you wanna do in C++ takes longer on average
 Astrobytes: Or ruby where you just seemingly type a random sequence of characters and win Noisewerk :P
 Noisewerk: Yeah but who uses Ruby :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
 nat69: wassup
 Astrobytes: Many, many people for CoC!
 nat69: why are you all so smart?
 Astrobytes: Only real solution is to have C++ only clashes
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: yo im jeff bezzo 
 TheNinja811: i use javascript
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: i work for bugatii
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: have a manton 
 Noisewerk: Honestly I noticed that C++ and Ruby clashers are in the same amount, but not that many
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: and eat food
 Astrobytes: ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: you're getting kicked if you don't stop your spammy rubbish
 darkhorse64: ^
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: oOoOOooOO sOrRy
 Noisewerk: Usually a lobby has 1/2 python. then 1/4 Javascript, then the rest some random with me on C++
 TheNinja811: WHAT

 darkhorse64: :hammer
 88888888888888888: mmm
 eulerscheZahl: you were faster this time Astrobytes
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: the nickname alone triggered me already
 CX-10: i am king george 111
 nat69: hi sonny
 Astrobytes: yeah, I was just waiting
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i get one too
 Astrobytes: You're all gonna get kicked if you don't stop spamming crap
 CX-10: hi sonny
 darkhorse64: It seems he has brothers
 CX-10: im not
 CX-10: i dont
 CX-10: im AT SCHOOL
 CX-10: sorry for caps
 darkhorse64: Then study
 Astrobytes: Do some learning then
 TobiasA: this site is not a good place to learn how to code at all
 CX-10: im being forced to do this
 TobiasA: it doesn't teach anything 
 eulerscheZahl: it is a good place if you want to learn
 Astrobytes: No. You learn elsewhere and practice here
 darkhorse64: There are worse things in life
 TobiasA: it just gives difficult challenges
 CX-10: ok
 Astrobytes: The clue is in the word "challenges"
 eulerscheZahl: requires some one investment to research topics
 nat69: wagwannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: yessssssssss myyyyyyyyyy ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
 CX-10: lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 TobiasA: i haven't been able to finish mars lander 2 for 2 years
 Astrobytes: Left that one for you
 Astrobytes: TobiasA: I think I did 3 before 2 lol
 eulerscheZahl: same. i hated the marslander
 TheNinja811: these coding puzzles are hard
 TobiasA: i bet you work for google or nasa
 eulerscheZahl: still traumatized from the crash sound
 Astrobytes: lol
 darkhorse64: It wrecked my PC
 Astrobytes: google or nasa? I'm not even a dev
 BillWell: nasa
 TobiasA: damn i have a lot to learn
 TobiasA: i feel dumber when i come hear
 TobiasA: here*
 88888888888888888: rjysdcftjud4gtrz
 Astrobytes: You shouldn't. It just means you have more to study
 Astrobytes: bans next time
 eulerscheZahl: do we have to warn every single one of the spammers before kicking?
 CX-10: no
 TobiasA: can you give me your mars lander code
 Astrobytes: Not if they're all doing the same stuff
 TobiasA: so i can learn it
 Astrobytes: lol, nope
 TobiasA: pls
 darkhorse64: Copy pasting is not learning

 Astrobytes: Not even gonna click that, I know what that is
 CX-10: ok
 TobiasA: pls astrobytes
 Astrobytes: no!
 TobiasA: can you teach me
 CX-10: pls gdem
 NitMpez: make that my ringtone
 TobiasA: teach me your ways
 Astrobytes: I'm a moderator not a personal tutor
 TobiasA: sigh
 Astrobytes: If you ask relevant questions then one of us is bound to help, but not  an entire walkthrough
 TobiasA: ok
 TobiasA: how do i get the right power and angle
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Donno. I used a GA
 TobiasA: waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
 TobiasA: i didnt know one had to go that deep
 Astrobytes: You don't. 
 eulerscheZahl: for part 2 you can use some if-else blocks

 eulerscheZahl: next is ban nat69
 darkhorse64: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/genetic-algorithm-mars-lander/</a>
 NitMpez: here's a question on mars lander... i never got my simulation to match up, because the input on next turn it gives you is an int, but it is like it keeps the double in the back ground... IE: turn 1 falling straight down you get 4, then 7 from the input... when 4 + the 3.711 or whatever the grav was gives you 8 when rounding... how did you handle that in your sim
 eulerscheZahl: i used my 2 code for optim
 eulerscheZahl: heuristic for initial solution. random search to mutate it and improve
 CX-10: can u unban 888888888
 TobiasA: where do you guys learn those big word thingies
 eulerscheZahl: the server uses floats all the time and only gives rounded values
 TobiasA: like heuristic
 eulerscheZahl: 8888 is kicked, not banned
 Astrobytes: ^
 CX-10: how doese he come back
 TobiasA: where do you learn how to make them
 NitMpez: so how do you handle that in your sim, do you just keep your simulated output as your input for the next turn?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28f6ff9c-fd19-4dbd-8494-c4306c47fe26">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/28f6ff9c-fd19-4dbd-8494-c4306c47fe26</a>
 CX-10: i will boss u in clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: the physics. trial and error until i got the same numbers as CG
 Noisewerk: Anyone familiar on how to fix Tab not indenting by default, but selecting next instead?
 eulerscheZahl: i only read the input in turn 1 and then completely ignore the location and speed that the server gives me (too inaccurate)
 Noisewerk: Other than restarting obv
 O_Musk_Dahan: Hiya!
 CX-10: eulerscheZahl unkick 888888
 eulerscheZahl: 8888 has to reload the page
 NitMpez: yeah, i did that... and was able to match... but normally I take the input from the server every turn... and reinitialize my sim with that
 eulerscheZahl: you can also create your own #spam_room (click that and talk to your classmates all you want)
 nat69: ayyyyyyyy
 BillWell: see all of your heads
 88888888888888888: thanks for letting me back in
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: can we make a spam room
 nat69: dont kick me u twits
 88888888888888888: i sleept on me keeboard
 BillWell: hmu on insta @wi11be11
 eulerscheZahl: marslander is a very old game. CG learned from their mistakes in later ones
 Astrobytes: click #spam_room
 CX-10: my wife left and took the kids
 BillWell: oof
 CX-10: Janet come back
 eulerscheZahl: your wife? you are at most 15 of age
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: L
 Licht: Didn't realise pre-schoolers learnt coding
 CX-10: 13
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: f
 CX-10: f
 TobiasA: you guys are all working?
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: f in the chat bois 
 BillWell: they didnt
 CX-10: yes
 88888888888888888: im 56 hello kids
 nat69: @ my insta @nathankillilea
 O_Musk_Dahan: 13 years old.
 BillWell: im 69
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: im 72
 CX-10: im 69 years old 420 days
 ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy: yo you lot are rubish at kicking peoploe 
 BillWell: @joshua.ajala
 Noisewerk: I think it's faster if all the rest move to a spam room then viceversa
 BillWell: thats my insta
 Noisewerk: smh
 nat69: yo g that really hurts that you kick me
 BillWell: viagra
 NitMpez: yeah, that is one of the main ones I've noticed issues with that on... I need to update and re-verify sometime.  I was able to solve it doing that... but it did some whacky stuff re-initializing with the ints it gave
 CX-10: luv that blue diamond
 CX-10: Janet why did u leave
 nat69: dont kick me again thanks luv u
 88888888888888888: :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: 2 got banned. be nice or you'll follow
 NitMpez: haven't even tried mars lander 3..... probably should of just started with it... and could of used solution for the other 2... oh well work on it after i finish acraft
 88888888888888888: i dp the VSA im a helpful epraosn
 nat69: im donald
 88888888888888888: trump
 Astrobytes: You both really want a ban huh?
 88888888888888888: no pls
 nat69: no thankyou
 Astrobytes: well shut up
 nat69: okay
 88888888888888888: im sorry bob

 nat69: no
 nat69: no
 nat69: no
 Astrobytes: everyone banned except you nat69
 nat69: y
 nat69: thankyou
 Astrobytes: you're next if you don't stop
 nat69: now unban them pls thankyou lotta luv b
 eulerscheZahl: there is no unban
 Astrobytes: Doesn't work like that.
 nat69: allow it g
 Bob: oh god I've been summoned by a troll
 Astrobytes: Warning -&gt; Kick -&gt; Ban
 eulerscheZahl: hi Bob
 nat69: rude
 Bob: o/
 Astrobytes: And you've had multiple kicks
 nat69: 69
 Astrobytes: hey Bob
 nat69: hi bob
 eulerscheZahl: shall we leave the last one for you?
 nat69: cyaaaaa boissssssss twat
 lukeisapoggerscoder: greetings bob
 Bob: nah, go ahead
 Astrobytes: too late
 O_Musk_Dahan: How old are you?
 Bob: I've just sent a nicely passive-aggressive mail to the top HR, that took enough frustration off for now&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: i like passive aggression
 Bob: although I wonder whether it wasn't slightly more aggressive than it was passive :D
 O_Musk_Dahan: i wish janet was here chums
 Astrobytes: you want a ban too eh
 O_Musk_Dahan: no
 Bob: well she just announced a series of weekly "Mental Health Safety Moments" because "the pandemic is causing so much stress"
 Astrobytes: A series of what now?
 Bob: I replied that the ongoing series of layoffs in the group was definitely a much more important source of stress just now
 Bob: well, what you see is what she said
 eulerscheZahl: you have a point in your reply
 Bob: I have no clue what it's supposed to be and I don't intend to go check
 Astrobytes: Yes, I think I would have replied the same in your situation
 Bob: I just spent the better part of the day moving stuff home and setting up home office because our local RH says I shouldn't be working on-site 4 all week long
 eulerscheZahl: been there too
 Bob: admittedly, 4 people in 700 square meters is rather crowded
 eulerscheZahl: worked 100% remotely for 5 monthsback to office in september+october (1-2 days a week)
 eulerscheZahl: now back to 100% at home
 Bob: I guess I'm way better off setting up a laptop on a desk corner at home and remote desktopping on a single screen to the workstation 15 minutes away from my home
 Bob: rather than hands-on on the actual station with the dual screen and motorized standing desktop
 eulerscheZahl: i just took the whole desktop machine in my room
 Bob: hah we can't do that
 Bob: desktops are not "allowed" to leave the office
 Bob: whatever the F that means
 eulerscheZahl: in the current situation we can do a lot of things that were impossible before
 Bob: maybe it's easier to steal a 70-pound station than a 4-pound laptop
 TobiasA: O.O
 Bob: I'm just an engineer, what do I know about these things
 eulerscheZahl: still only 1 monitor on my private desk. but 27" at least
 Bob: for some reason, 2 days a week was apparently OK, though
 Bob: but not 4
 Bob: I have to admit my failure at seeing the logic here is absolute
 TobiasA: i forgot how format variables into strings in c++
 eulerscheZahl: use a stringstream
 Bob: if you want to print them, just &lt;&lt; them to cout
 TobiasA: i am losing brain cells
 Bob: otherwise, stringstream yeah
 Astrobytes: Viruses care about how many days you work in a row Bob. You can clearly only get infected after 2 days.
 Bob: yeah, just like they're more aggressive to people doing sports than to people commuting to work
 Bob: damn viruses
 Bob: you so smart
 TobiasA: if i want to include it it's sstream right?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, exactly.
 eulerscheZahl: iostream i think
 eulerscheZahl: haven't used it in a while
 Bob: or strstream&#160;?
 BlaiseEbuth: sstream
 TobiasA: so which one
 Bob: otherwise you can go dirty and go back to sprintf :D
 Astrobytes: sstream iirc
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/stringstream/">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/stringstream/</a>yeah, sstream
 TobiasA: wth is that
 TobiasA: ok thanks
 Bob: god I just feel old now
 <b>**eulerscheZahl knows sprintf too</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: strings in C were a pain
 Astrobytes: They still are
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't have to code in C anymore :D
 Astrobytes: fair&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i successfully passed my first semester at university
 Illedan: :wave:
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Astrobytes: hey
 eulerscheZahl: you gave up on topcoder?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: Problem didn't motivate me
 Illedan: Got enough shit to think about :P 
 eulerscheZahl: i hereby declare victory over Illedan
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: :clap:
 TobiasA: so you in university
 eulerscheZahl: also: where's my numbershifting app?
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: no, i graduated 2.5 years ago
 Illedan: Uhm
 Astrobytes: No TobiasA, some people on here are
 TobiasA: no wonder you guys are so good at coding
 eulerscheZahl: didn't learn much coding there actually
 TobiasA: what did you study then?
 eulerscheZahl: computer science
 TobiasA: you seeeeee
 Illedan: I'll see if I can focus it this weekend euler.
 eulerscheZahl: i mean sure, i had some coding lectures. but also a lot of theory
 TobiasA: i dont even have any coding lectures
 Illedan: I can accept my BattleStation not being done if I can push NS to the world
 TobiasA: because i literally just finished high school few weeks ago
 eulerscheZahl: do you think that battlestation would be a big help?
 Astrobytes: That's dedication Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: congrats for graduating TobiasA
 TobiasA: i have to suffer by learning from yt and google and here-_-
 Astrobytes: yes, congrats TobiasA. Lots of great stuff out there to learn from
 TobiasA: no one wants to teach me
 TobiasA: fank you
 Illedan: Yeah, if I can connect my AI to it. For automatic debugging of replays, gathering of data and getting stats from replays
 eulerscheZahl: we all started there. the first steps are hard
 eulerscheZahl: the more you know, the easier it is to further expand the knowledge
 Illedan: Word
 TobiasA: das deep
 eulerscheZahl: you code in MS Word?
 Astrobytes: Yep. Goes for most things in life tbh
 Astrobytes: lol
 TobiasA: wat
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes knows the article i'm about to link

 Scarfield: wait, you dont code in Word?
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Noisewerk: LibreOffice
 Astrobytes: I hand-write everything first, scan it in, then copy it into Google Docs. Like a Real Man.
 Illedan: Your compiler is basically image classification to read the handwriting to text?
 Astrobytes: Of course. Doesn't everyone do that?
 Illedan: I used punched cards..
 Scarfield: how do you comment, cursive?
 Astrobytes: OG
 Illedan: Comment is red marker
 Astrobytes: Pff. Comments.
 Scarfield: kids these days, low effort and no appreciation of the time when i went to school up hill both ways
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Illedan: Anyone tried the Blocking game yet? The branching factor :explosion:
 Astrobytes: I have nothing serious implemented yet. Quite a game.
 Scarfield: it looks interesting, but it cant be worse than D&amp;B?
 Illedan: Far worse.
 Astrobytes: Much, much worse.
 kovi: what is the problem with db?
 Scarfield: no problem with it, just a lot of choices
 Astrobytes: For Blocking I guess something like paranoid might work
 kovi: oh, so that is why depth1 works so well
 Scarfield: oh googled it, one paper mentions a branching factor as high as 650, i guess the mid-game is a b*tch
 TobiasA: can you guys suggest something for me to make in c++ for me to get better
 Scarfield: wait that was for a 20x20 grid with 21 blocks, but ill take your word 
 AntiSquid: make a 3D game
 TobiasA: oh hell no
 TobiasA: i cant even make a 2d
 Scarfield: 5D
 TobiasA:  sdl2 is hard to setup
 AntiSquid: then you can't get better
 TobiasA: well you need to take it easy on me
 TobiasA: start small
 Astrobytes: try SFML
 TobiasA: do yo know how to make a 3d game astro
 Astrobytes: I can get my head around it yes, I haven't made any
 AntiSquid: TobiasA <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.app/?q=c%2B%2B+projects+tutorials+github">https://lmgtfy.app/?q=c%2B%2B+projects+tutorials+github</a>
 TobiasA: can sfml be used for 3d
 TobiasA:&#160;?
 AntiSquid: geez had the conversation at work today, a nurse said her 13 year old tell her to google what she doesn't know LOL
 AntiSquid: told *
 Astrobytes: lol
 TobiasA: hahahaha
 Astrobytes: TobiasA, it's built on OpenGL so in theory yes. But I have no idea why you would do such a thing
 TobiasA: ok so what do i use for 3d games
 Astrobytes: how can you make a 3d game if you can't make a 2d game?
 TobiasA: i want to know what i can use for both 2d and 3d so when i learn 2d i wont have to use another library for 3d
 abmyii: Sorry for randomly jumping in, but I'd suggest using a game engine such as Godot or Unity
 TobiasA: something that uses c++
 abmyii: Must it be C++?
 abmyii: SDL2 is your best bet in that case, and you'll have to learn how to set it up
 abmyii: Godot uses its own language which is very easy to learn
 abmyii: And also has C# support - which Unity uses
 Skynse: Do you guys ever get so close to finishing a clash of code problem, but your eyes don't see a line for a split second so you miss out on some time to delete some bad code
 Skynse: painful moment
 TobiasA: mhm
 TobiasA: i feel you
 Skynse: It was left with like 3 seconds, and I couldn't get my cursor to the part where I was iterating through an integer instead of the list itself
 eulerscheZahl: can't happen to me
 abmyii: Otherwise these are some of the most popular open-source game engines *written* in C++ (so not necessarily scripted in C++): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/search?l=C%2B%2B&amp;o=desc&amp;q=game+engine&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories">https://github.com/search?l=C%2B%2B&amp;o=desc&amp;q=game+engine&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories</a>
 Skynse: C++ is :muscle:
 Noisewerk: Check out this YT channel (I linked the C++ playlist): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&amp;list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&amp;ab_channel=TheCherno">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0&amp;list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb&amp;ab_channel=TheCherno</a>
 Noisewerk: He's great and explains how to write C++ code with game development in mind
 Noisewerk: He is a game engine developer so you can find a lot of other related videos to that
 TobiasA: ok thnx
 Astrobytes: Also this guy:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA</a>

 Astrobytes: Not even gonna click that
 jacek: but you clicked
 Astrobytes: Nope
 Astrobytes: It's going to be ponies or something I know it
 CursingLlama: Somehow Fog of War on CodeBusters is disabled and I can't see it with debug mode on or off. Any idea how I could fix that?
 Astrobytes: The fog of war setting underneath debug?
 CursingLlama: Yeah, I open settings and I can see the fog of war options, but it's greyed out and I can't change the setting.
 Astrobytes: After playing a match it's still greyed out?
 CursingLlama: Yes. I've tried refreshing the page, but that didn't fix it.
 Astrobytes: Hm. Works for me. What league?
 CursingLlama: bronze league
 Astrobytes: Also Bronze for me... strange
 Astrobytes: Which browser?
 CursingLlama: chrome
 Astrobytes: Same here. Any addons/plugins running?
 CursingLlama: I run a few, but nothing that should be interfering. It worked initially and I turned it off while I started out. Just can't seem to adjust it now.
 Astrobytes: Very odd. I assume you've cleared the cache and restarted the browser/computer etc etc.Anyone else able to reproduce this one?
 CursingLlama: I haven't. I was kind of hoping it was something stupid I was missing.
 CursingLlama: I guess I'll go that route.
 Astrobytes: Well, give that a go (hey it works sometimes&#160;;) ) and let me know
 CursingLlama: Just closing chrome and reopening did it.
 Astrobytes: Ah nice one&#160;:) 
 SandmanSW96: hey, not sure where to report a bug, nothing major
 eulerscheZahl: try here
 SandmanSW96: cool,
 SandmanSW96: well glad to see the clash chats back hehe, but I close the old ones, and every time I start another clash, it reopens all of them
 eulerscheZahl: reopening chats is a known problem in general. also for private messages
 Westicles: hey euler, those space maze puzzles are fun. 
 SandmanSW96: gotcha, just putting it out there.  unlike other websites you guys actually care how it functions lol
 eulerscheZahl: you like space maze? :oit's a bit painful :D
 Westicles: I just played them manually...
 eulerscheZahl: lol
 Illedan: And hardcoded your code? :P 
 eulerscheZahl: i've never finished part 2<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/45453c544c0e11ec2dbd2c27d1290b4f878d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/45453c544c0e11ec2dbd2c27d1290b4f878d</a>
 eulerscheZahl: afk, cat time
 BiMathAx: hello, in the puzzle Spring challenge, the ID of the pack stay the same during all the game&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Illedan, Space Maze app next
 Westicles: Yeah, most are pretty short but there is one tricky one
 BiMathAx: ok thank's
 Astrobytes: I don't remember BiMathAx
 wlesavo: damn, i have only a few prediction mistakes in cg sponsored now, but it still hurts a lot, literally the same code can end up between 3k and 8k just because some early mistakes lead to death
 Illedan: Sure Astrobytes. It's not a copy of another game?
 Astrobytes: Not anything current anyway Illedan, I think euler based it on some ancient 8-bit game
 maras: er
 eulerscheZahl: and i still haven't figured out how the original game is called

 waterboy: how to use thrust
 waterboy:&#160;?
 jacek: was it from nes or something?
 eulerscheZahl: DOS or windows. that's all I had back in the days
 jacek: noice
 eulerscheZahl: i never had a gaming console actually. the only change other the years: windows -&gt; linux
 Astrobytes: Consoles are overrated, you didn't miss much
 eulerscheZahl: played a few times at a friend's house
 jacek: he probably bought et game for atari and is salty to this day
 eulerscheZahl: but didn't like going there that much. his parents were both chain smokers
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Astrobytes: Oh how lovely&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: I hated visiting friends with parents like that
 jacek: they wre chain smokers because they played console games?
 Astrobytes: :smirk:

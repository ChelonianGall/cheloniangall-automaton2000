 elie.f.asmar: One of the challenges of the quest map consists of approving or rejecting a contribution, however I could only upvote or downvote; your help is appreciated.
 5DN1L: You need to meet certain requirements before you can approve or reject contributions
 5DN1L: Any player who has played more than 50 clashes has approver rights for clash contributions
 5DN1L: Any player whose level is greater or equals to 20 has approver rights for other contributions
 elie.f.asmar: I have played more than 50 clashes, and the quest is currently my only active quest. However, i cannot find any process/ button within  the contributions that says approve/disapprove
 5DN1L: which one?
 5DN1L: it may be WIP
 5DN1L: WIP can't be approved or rejected
 elie.f.asmar: Moderate a contribution
 5DN1L: i mean which contribution
 5DN1L: if a contribution is a WIP you can't approve or reject it
 elie.f.asmar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/15393a564554228a5628109e94abdf89702a6">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/15393a564554228a5628109e94abdf89702a6</a>
 5DN1L: that's a WIP
 5DN1L: it's stated below the author's name
 elie.f.asmar: okay, thank you very much

 geppoz: I got a message that i completed the "become a legend" target, but... in which game?? :sweat_smile:
 geppoz: I didn't find it
 geppoz: it is not the last contest, so... they recalculate some old leaderboard?
 Uljahn: those are just occasional submits
 geppoz: still, in all challenge I see completed in my profile, only gold there...
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgmulti.azke.fr/players?p=geppoz">https://cgmulti.azke.fr/players?p=geppoz</a>
 Uljahn: this might be helpful
 geppoz: thanks, as said, no legend there :grinning:
 geppoz: that should be an "ad honorem" reward :D
 Uljahn: you can click xp progress bar to see details of recent xp gains
 geppoz: it said "+100XP - Quest - Become a legend" but no clue on which contenst it refers to
 geppoz: *says
 Uljahn: there is the "Clash of code legend" achievement for 500 CoCs played, but it's worth of 250 xp
 Uljahn: ah, you are talking about quest map
 Uljahn: i think there is a bug with defining legend league as the last one, because some games have wood leagues only, so wood 1 equals to legend
 Uljahn: i think it was Connect 4 in your case geppoz
 Leeward: Speaking of the quest map, I'm trying to start the Optimization path but I'm stuck at 39200/40000 in Code vs. Zombies lol... any advice?
 Uljahn: randomize your search, then spam-submit :smiley:
 Uljahn: i mean if your search is deterministic you can hardcode your first move to be in random direction and then submit with different seeds
 Leeward: That feels like cheating
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_ass">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_wild_ass</a>
 5DN1L: wrong channel
 derjack: oO
 5DN1L: Leeward you can refer to the forum post for some ideas
 Leeward: Thanks
 Uljahn: Monte Carlo search is not cheating btw :smirk:
 Leeward: Well technically no but it's more like flinging all the sh*t at the wall to see what sticks
 Uljahn: that's exactly what Evolutionary Algorithms actually do
 Uljahn: and Neural Networks
 kovi: nah, it is just that cg setup is not good for competitive optimization(not enough testcases, unbalanced score of testcases)
 Uljahn: true
 Leeward: And also the compute time limitations don't really allow for much "think time" on each test case for this type of approach
 derjack: so you need to make it more efficient
 Leeward: or find another approach better suited to the problem
 Uljahn: add pragmas [solved]
 Uljahn: i guess better approach would be to use anytime simulation-based search algorithms
 TKirishima: please some tacos!
 5DN1L: antiwonto is offline
 Yozamu: Hey guys, I'm trying to code golf "Don't panic" in JS.Do you have any tip to reduce below 200 characters&#160;? The split+map to numbers when I read lines seem to take quite some space but I cannot think of a shortcut... And same goes for logic, I'm stuck at ~230
 5DN1L: have you made a function for readline?
 Yozamu: yep
 Yozamu: but I still have r().split` `.map(Number)Which occurs three times
 Ajaiy: Today I learnt how dangerous programming can be by watching a simple program almost destroy my computer
 Ajaiy: def hextobinmeg(he, cnt): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/45e1a08e-066e-405b-88ac-cebd4068eb2a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/45e1a08e-066e-405b-88ac-cebd4068eb2a</a>
 5DN1L: don't you have fn_name=()=&gt;etc? Yozamu
 Yozamu: Uh I just have r=readline, not sure what you meant there. Like, storing the whole function?
 5DN1L: yes
 Yozamu: would something liker=()=&gt;readline().split` `.map(Number)and then calling with r() work&#160;?
 5DN1L: you can try :wink:
 Yozamu: true, ty for the hint, not sure it'll be enough for below 200, but will definitely help
 5DN1L: np
 Yozamu: 218 damn it, still seems so far away
 5DN1L: Do you really need to map Number?
 Yozamu: It doesn't work without it so I guess so
 Yozamu: Well I think I can see what you mean there
 Yozamu: Alright 196 is way enough for me, thanks again
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 5DN1L: I hope I get a hint to get below 102 :joy: (without the compression trick)
 5DN1L: (and without hardcoding)
 Yozamu: uuuuh seems small

 Ajaiy: 5DN1L: Are moderators allowed to ban bots?
 5DN1L: i think so, why?
 Ajaiy: Because people may use it as a loophole to spam or sth
 5DN1L: i see. well i don't think the chat distinguishes between the two, but i dunno
 5DN1L: at least i had kicked antiwonto before
 Ajaiy: wait what
 5DN1L: when antiwonto went out of control
 5DN1L: and wontonimo wasn't online
 Ajaiy: i don't understand how a bot could get out of control
 5DN1L: antiwonto spammed the chat that time lol
 5DN1L: bugs in its code
 Ajaiy: understandable
 5DN1L: if Automaton2000 writes things here non-stop, I'll have to kick it out too
 Automaton2000: this sounds like a lot of fun

 Ayza: anything can probably be done without regex with a bit of work
 Ayza: I have a regular expressions skill but I've never used it lol

 jacek: it doesnt suck in vacuumCleanerLang
 zakacat: lol
 Uljahn: btw you can use sys.setrecursionlimit() in python
 Uljahn: default value is kinda low
 MAWAAW: no 
 jacek: Oo
 jacek: and there is some @memoize to cache intermediate results
 Uljahn: @cache and @lru_cache from functools?
 Uljahn: it's always easier to blame a language than yourself :smirk:

 struct: Bullet's damage radius is 120, the damage caused at the bullet's position is 10 and decreases linearly with the distance to it, reaching 0 at damage radius. The bullet is shot with the given velocities along each axis (in relation to the ship), with the resultant velocity being clipped to be at most 100.
 struct: Isnt it this?
 demetedPufferfish: Does the bullet have to hit somewhere on the ship, or does it have to hit the center coordinates?
 struct: from what i understand it doesnt
 struct: but damages decreases based on distance
 demetedPufferfish: Ok, so it just has to hit the center of the ship?
 struct: no  it can be at 120 distance
 struct: but it wont do full damage
 demetedPufferfish: Ok, Thank You!
 Wizard-Dude: does anyone know how to calculate your vx and vy after you activate shield in mad pod racer?
 Reyil: hi
 vvgf: aaron i just got back my sol score
 vvgf: guess what i got
 vvgf: well anyway i got a 600
 vvgf: perfect score 
 vvgf: it was 85 questions
 struct: vx = vx * 0.85vy = vy * 0.85
 Wizard-Dude: thanks! 
 struct: but that is when turn ends
 struct: you should move and then only after all moves are completed you should updated the velocity
 Reyil: hi
 Dono1: Could anyone explain what's special about the '%' character when trying to convert to binary?
 struct: you need trailing zeros
 struct: it needs to be 7 bit binary
 struct: so if it is 1011
 struct: you need to convert it to 0001011
 Dono1: Ok, thank you! I didn't realize it was something like that at all, lol. Going to study up on that a bit.
 jacek: a 7th bit :smirk:

 Breakmaster: are anyone good at the mad pod race&#160;??
 MAWAAW: no
 Breakmaster: I cant understand the first exercise
 Ajaiy: wood?
 MAWAAW: print x y&#160;?&#160;:)
 Ajaiy: you just print the next target of your pod's x-axis and y-axis separated by a space
 Ajaiy: if that is the case
 Breakmaster: like this?
 Breakmaster:  console.log(nextCheckpointX, nexCheckpointY);
 struct: and thrust
 Breakmaster: how do i ad the thrust 
 struct: console.log(nextCheckpointX, nextCheckpointY, 100);
 Ajaiy: print("5000 6000 100")
 Ajaiy: For example
 Ajaiy: Sorry I forgot about that

 jacek: pascal?
 Wontonimo: who is blaise?
 Westicles: your french buddy
 jacek: a former mod
 Wontonimo: that's a use of the word "buddy" that I am unfamiliar with
 Darleanow: I'm good sir&#160;!! sry, been off for a bit, is everything ok now&#160;?
 Darleanow: maybe a level based chat would be great
 Darleanow: i.e ppl who have been here for quite a while would we able to be in it
 Darleanow: and also your XP points on CG
 Westicles: people who have been here quite  while are the people they are least interested in
 Westicles: though I'm not sure they are interested in any of us at this point
 Westicles: very few quality US guys on here

 Dono1: For the MIME Type challenge, my solution is timing out. I currently do pass all the other tests. What kinds of things might be the culprit here? I'm creating a large Map but idk if that's the issue.
 Dono1: Timing out on the final test**
 Dono1: final test has 9999 elements in the association table, and 9999 file names to be analyzed.
 jacek: i use map also and it works for me
 Dono1: hm
 jacek: depends how you use those
 jacek: i have N loop and Q loop. its O(N+Q) i think
 Dono1: just mapping the file extensions to the mime type

 Abdullah7890: did anyone study Mad Pod Racing 
 5DN1L: It's automatically changed into pastebin
 jacek: yeah
 Dono1: Gotcha 5DN1L
 jacek: Dono1 dunno if this is issue. but you can put lower cased extension into map in the first place
 5DN1L: just convert into lowercase no matter what and compare on that basis. no conditions tested, no questions asked.
 Dono1: Ok I will try that. I wasn't sure if the map might have keys that are uppercase.
 5DN1L: but it doesn't matter
 5DN1L: when you just convert :wink:
 Dono1: I think I get what you're saying. I will need to convert both the map keys *and* the file extensions to lowercase.
 5DN1L: yes, everything before doing anything
 Foxboy: why does this chat have participants
 Foxboy: isn't it supposed to be common between all users?
 jacek: participants?
 Foxboy: third Button bottom left
 Dono1: 5DN1L, do you think there's a problem with building up a huge string and then console.log'ing that string to deliver the answer? I figured that's how we are expected to submit (?)
 5DN1L: oh
 5DN1L: you don't have to
 5DN1L: you can just console.log after analysing each case
 5DN1L: i mean each file
 Dono1: Ahhh. I thought on all games on the site, you could only have a single console.log happen.
 jacek: w00t
 Dono1: That should reduce memory usage lol.
 5DN1L: definitely
 5DN1L: for you to change that
 Wontonimo: hey Abdullah7890 , I can help you with mad pod racing
 Dono1: Yeah that fixed it. I was no longer concatenating a huge string, and I removed some other unused variables as well.

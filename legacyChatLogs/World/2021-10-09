 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'll fall asleep
 eulerscheZahl: the expected solution is wrong. if you solve it, your submit will fail
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and drool on my kb
 Wontonimo: well that sucks
 eulerscheZahl: that's why it was taken down

 eulerscheZahl: oh, only 2s time limit, last time it was 10 or 15
 Wontonimo: what was the name of that game where squares triangle and circles battle over three suns&#160;?
 Wontonimo: you entered it and won eth eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: yare.io
 eulerscheZahl: they are about to redesign their game a bit. playing with some ideas but nothing publicly available yetthey intend another contest within approx 6 months
 Westicles: huawei looks very boring but nice prizes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Long day, laying down, g'nite glhf
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :sleeping:
 eulerscheZahl: i've seen better than the current Huawei. probably wouldn't play without prizes

 Thorcode: Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input. If input is below 0 or above 12 throw an exception of type ArgumentOutOfRangeException (C#) or IllegalArgumentException (Java) or RangeException (PHP) or throw a RangeError (JavaScript) or ValueError (Python) or return -1 (C).
 Thorcode: could someone explain this for a stupid like me&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: do you know what a factorial is?
 eulerscheZahl: n! = 1*2*3*...*n
 Thorcode: I solved that
 Thorcode: but what is the execption my mind boom
 eulerscheZahl: so in C#: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d18e5bde-f028-4799-82ab-8e36440e7c27">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d18e5bde-f028-4799-82ab-8e36440e7c27</a>
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:/
 Thorcode: nope I tried that too
 TheBlueBias: How's your ICPC?
 eulerscheZahl: it's meh
 Thorcode: Should throw error
 Thorcode: and this come out
 TechnoBot: Who will 1v1 me
 eulerscheZahl: i can kick you if you want
 TheBlueBias: Meh?

 Thorcode: what happend
 TechnoBot: bruh
 TechnoBot: man
 TechnoBot: I wanna 1v1 someone
 eulerscheZahl: now i really want to kick
 TechnoBot: in hypixel
 TheBlueBias: You don't throw exception Thorcode...
 TheBlueBias: *error
 TheBlueBias: return -1 is for C
 Thorcode: oh ok
 Thorcode: nothing changed
 TheBlueBias: eulerscheZahl do we agree that flows are concurrent on the network?
 Thorcode: that site is suck
 eulerscheZahl: yes blaise
 eulerscheZahl: i think your code sucks thor
 TheBlueBias: What code did you try Thorcode
 Thorcode: return "ValueError"
 eulerscheZahl: facepalm
 TheBlueBias: :D
 Thorcode:&#160;?
 TheBlueBias: Learn about python exceptions Thorcode
 Thorcode: yep that why i'm stupid
 eulerscheZahl: google: "python valueerror"
 Thorcode: thanks so much
 TheBlueBias: euler: Seems logical, but wasn't really clear in the statement. Except if I missed something...
 eulerscheZahl: statement has its flaws, especially in regards to groupid
 TheBlueBias: Yeah, that too.
 TheBlueBias: And no public test available? 
 Thorcode: &lt;class 'ValueError'&gt; oh this is why i'm stupid
 Thorcode: thanks all
 eulerscheZahl: learning how to look things up is an important skill for a programmer (and also in general)
 Thorcode: I was struggling with it about 1 hour :9
 TheBlueBias: You're not stupid because you don't know things, that's normal, you'll learn. But you're stupid to persist without recognizing you don't know and just go learn about what miss you...
 Thorcode: use C is the easiest
 Thorcode: just return -1
 ash15khng: hes too good hes never run into an error in his life
 daxigua: Hello,world!;:stuck_out_tongue:
 Thorcode: hello
 geppoz: hi
 Thorcode: eulerscheZahl could you show me the kick button pls
 eulerscheZahl: really?
 Thorcode: yep i want to see that button in imgur
 Thorcode: not kick me
 eulerscheZahl: F5 to get back
 Thorcode: wow that button is so powerful
 jacek: oO
 Thorcode: I will try to be better to have that button
 eulerscheZahl: there's also a ban (it's not a button btw, you just write "/kick Thorcode"). Ban is permanent, I miss an option in between like kick for 24h
 jacek: you can ban and unban 24h later
 Thorcode: it like that you have more command than us
 Thorcode: oh I get it
 jacek: hes premium user
 eulerscheZahl: i never understood how to use unban, works with some external chat clients. the webchat does not support it
 Thorcode: what is the end of back to code?
 detastoa: is the whole game free?
 Thorcode: oh I'm lack of read
 Thorcode: yep
 eulerscheZahl: codingame is entirely free for 2 exceptions: some escape rooms and the recruiting part. But both are not part of the main page
 eulerscheZahl: the "fun page"
 eulerscheZahl: (implying that escape is not fun :imp:)
 Thorcode: yep escape cost money
 detastoa: r u guys professional coders?
 eulerscheZahl: I code for a living, yes
 Thorcode: no I'm just a noob
 detastoa: what language are u guys adept most
 Thorcode: python?
 detastoa: cool
 eulerscheZahl: C#, but I also code in others if needed
 detastoa: im beginner and i dont get why people r adept at many languages at the same time
 Thorcode: to use in Clash of code 
 eulerscheZahl: sometimes you have to use a certain language for whatever reason
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. if you want to upload your own games here on CodinGame (yes, you can do that), you have to use a language that compiles to JVM such as Java
 eulerscheZahl: when I participated at the yare.io contest, JavaScript was best supported, so I used that
 Thorcode: will you join this contest? eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: at work I sometimes have to deal with a framework that's written in C++
 eulerscheZahl: which contest?
 Thorcode: fall contest :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I don't consider this a contest
 eulerscheZahl: no, won't play
 Thorcode: yep escape with you is not fun&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: not fun with me? how can you tell?
 Thorcode: (implying that escape is not fun :imp:)
 eulerscheZahl: ah right
 Thorcode: or you need imgur?
 detastoa: should i learn languages all at once or only focus on one
 TimothyAlexisVass: What am I doing wrong with this?tr A-Za-z `printf %s {Z..A} {z..a}`

 detastoa: u guys all are great. i admire those who good at coding. such a cool thing
 jacek: focus on one or two. most languages have similar syntax
 eulerscheZahl: yes, start with one. the rest comes over time
 TimothyAlexisVass: I'm thinking this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b73743eb-9829-41d6-9e7b-ca61f4a665db">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b73743eb-9829-41d6-9e7b-ca61f4a665db</a>
 detastoa: what age u all start coding?
 Thorcode: 10
 eulerscheZahl: mybe 15
 jacek: on punchcards?
 TheBlueBias: :p
 TheBlueBias: First time I use Codeforces, is there really no available tests excepted the example euler? (Or any other participating to ICPC)
 dreadylein: around 15 i would say , seriously at least
 eulerscheZahl: yes blaise: only that one minimalistic setwas a problem for me last time as well: i generated my own larger testcases and my improvements barely had any effect offline. submitted anyways and it had a huge impact on their testcases
 TheBlueBias: Hmm.. OK. Blind mode, so...
 jacek: fog of war
 Manjius: i know a guy who started at 30 and is properly working
 dreadylein: define properly :D 
 TheBlueBias: He makes good coffee.
 dreadylein: fair ^^
 jacek: java?
 SNEEDSTER: Imagine still working (especially in a corpo) in your 30s, couldn't be me
 jacek: crypto eh
 SNEEDSTER: pretty much
 DomiKo: question to 2048: how are you handling 65536 tile?
 DomiKo: 5 bits per tile seems like a waste
 YurkovAS: DomiKouint32_t grid[4][4];
 DomiKo: lol
 YurkovAS: beam search + snake heuristic
 DomiKo: i'm wondering if I could make simulation fast enough 
 YurkovAS: in result return not all moves: movesCount - 10
 DomiKo: right now, my beam isn't really deep. I'm resetting it after 32 moves.
 Westicles: as long as it is deterministic you can hardcode in spots to clear the big tiles
 jacek: you can do it offline, speed problem solved
 DomiKo: too many moves
 eulerscheZahl: i was fully aware what I was doing and how it affects hardcoding when I created the testcases :imp:
 jacek:&#160;:(
 DomiKo: yeah&#160;:/
 DomiKo: but still we can hardcode a lot
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 DomiKo: so for me welcome 128bits
 jacek: we can make something like... opening book
 eulerscheZahl: middle books
 Shrimpster: So... Ive made a fairly descent MCTS for tictactoe got me to top 100 in gold, to beat the bot what do I need? more optimization to catch more moves, or is there some bug I havent figured out yet in my code? 
 YurkovAS: add bitboard
 DomiKo: you know about Teclles?
 struct: how many rollouts do you have Shrimpster?
 struct: 10k?
 Shrimpster: No, about 2k on the first rounds (except 1st)
 Shrimpster: Whats teclles? 
 Shrimpster: Also yes, I use bitboard
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2413364b-f6d2-43c1-bfc2-66247cea4cc4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2413364b-f6d2-43c1-bfc2-66247cea4cc4</a>
 jacek: also, try C exploration tuning. try using mate-in-one in tree and simulation turns. and try mcts solver
 Shrimpster: ah instead of searching for all possible next moves just use one? DomiKo
 DomiKo: yes
 struct: with vanilla mcts you need 20k rollouts on 2nd turn
 DomiKo: it's simple heuristic for early game
 Shrimpster: Will do jacek&#160;:) thanks for the list 
 YurkovAS: oh, i'm never try #3 :thinking:
 struct: me neither
 jacek:&#160;?
 YurkovAS: 3) On random rollout also only consider this move when simulating
 jacek: when i used teccles, i only used it as opening book. never in search
 DomiKo: I tried #3 and my bot was better
 darkhorse64: domiko: you can reach the 131k tile in some test cases, you need more bits
 darkhorse64: at 2048
 eulerscheZahl: btw saw you mentioning a random submit validator darkhorse64. i can assure you there isn't
 eulerscheZahl: i know it says "random" on submit. CG had a bug. fixed now but not retroactive. it plays the correct cases but shows wrong names
 eulerscheZahl: random is only a visible testcase for sharing replays without leaking any info. everything else is testcase+validator
 darkhorse64: The random test case is not random&#160;? :scream:
 TheBlueBias: Nope. Your bot is just bad.
 eulerscheZahl: no, the CG server monster got drunk
 eulerscheZahl: the JBMs troll escaped
 darkhorse64: My bot is a faithful one. It repeatedly gives me 56 M
 eulerscheZahl: if you have a deterministic solution, you can submit it twice. you'll get the very same score
 eulerscheZahl: clear indicator of no random
 struct: referee checks for the code
 DomiKo: darkhorse64 131K tile ohhh god
 darkhorse64: It depends on the server speed. It may go deeper 
 darkhorse64: the 128 bit is enough
 darkhorse64: @domiko
 DomiKo: yeah I know. I'm converting my code from 64 to 128
 TheBlueBias: No. Not you darkhorse64! The @Monster got you! Noooooo!!!! :scream:
 darkhorse64: Depending on the test case, I change my search parameters. It won me 2M more. The bitboard monster totally owns me. 
 struct: whos bitboard monster?
 eulerscheZahl: and in case you missed it: you can disable the replay if it gets laggy
 eulerscheZahl: just print a "-" in your move sequence
 darkhorse64: TheBlueBias has met him along with Cthulu
 eulerscheZahl: or you collect your whole family, get some popcorn and watch it to the end
 darkhorse64: Good point eulerscheZahl, it freezes my browser for every test during quite some time. No, there is no enough popcorn on earth for 60K moves replays
 TheBlueBias: I was speaking of the @Monster, the one that makes you put @ in front of nicks...
 darkhorse64: @TheBlueBias: I see you
 TheBlueBias: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: 60k moves at a play speed of 500ms per frame (?)that's like 10 hours of entertainment
 DomiKo: "Depending on the test case, I change my search parameters." That's my current plan. I want to use something like CMA-ES for getting best parameters for each testcase.
 darkhorse64: "entertainment". I would not call it like that
 eulerscheZahl: you weren't supposed to play it like that
 <b>**darkhorse64 feverishly googling CMA-ES</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: i worked hard to squeeze the entire replay in 1MB, so you better enjoy it
 DomiKo: I never print - to enjoy my bot
 darkhorse64: Google search replied: wait for Domiko in the leaderboard before writing any code
 DomiKo: nahhh 
 <b>**struct waits for the boss</b></p><p><img src="/a/71042767029501" /> <b>**TheBlueBias wait.</b></p><p><img src="/a/46567648927625" /> DomiKo: good results will require a lot of CPU time, so...
 darkhorse64: chat or code
 jacek: wait till you find that n-tuple for 2048 paper
 TimothyAlexisVass: hi!
 darkhorse64: CG 2048 is very different from true 2048 because of predictible random
 jacek: its easier
 darkhorse64: yeah, in the paper, people are in extasy when they get the 65k tile. Here, you fail if you do not get it everytime

 DomiKo: because I'm surprised that there is build in hash for uint128
 TheBlueBias: Oh&#160;?
 DomiKo: yeah hash&lt;__uint128_t&gt; is already implemented
 jacek: oO
 BobLob: the results of gcc --version is gcc (Debian 10.2.1-6) 10.2.1 20210110 
 DomiKo: and it's weird, because I have 11.1.0 and I have to implement it myself
 jacek: march=native?
 DomiKo: same flags for local and CG version
 DomiKo: and yes, I have march=native
 DomiKo: could it be this? because of diffrent CPU?
 jacek: what cpu do you have
 TheBlueBias: "__int128 is supported for targets which have an integer mode wide enough to hold 128 bits"
 DomiKo: I have Intel i7 8 gen
 jacek: potato edition?
 DomiKo: so I guess i have newer CPU than CG
 DomiKo: potato edition?
 jacek: dunno why you wouldnt have hash yourslef but yes on cg
 TheForgottenMutant_ee85: :confused:
 BobLob: Here its Intel Core Processor (Haswell, no TSX)... i6
 jacek: am i the only amd guy around here
 TheBlueBias: Amd...
 jacek: 16 cores! good for my multi threading stuff i do all the time

 DomiKo: what was last week?
 jacek: we dont mention last week here
 TheBlueBias: There's no such thing.

 richardM72: New tot he site and figuring out you can't call Console.ReadLine() more then once per "turn" really slowed me down
 jacek: hm?
 richardM72: I was using Console.ReadLine() in an if statement and then assigning Console.ReadLine inside the if statement. I didnt know each call to Console.ReadLine() gave new data
 Porsuk: now you know
 richardM72: Not a big deal it just stalled me out for a bit lol

 richardM72: ASCII ART has me confused. What is the format of WriteLine? It keeps saying Expected: ###
 richardM72: Oh nevermind, it's feeding me ASCII art that I need to access programtically.
 jacek: yes
 richardM72: Do I have to build a switch case in a loop with 27 cases? Seems like a lot of work for a level 1 puzzle
 struct: which puzzle?
 richardM72: Its called ASCII ART
 struct: I dont think switch case is needed
 richardM72: The way I'm thinking about it, there are 27 letters being fed to me in 5 line. I loop through the individual letters of the word I'm given and select the correct 4 indices for that letter (0 to 3 is A, 4 to 7 is B, etc). 
 richardM72: characters not letters
 richardM72: I need the switch to select the right positions for each line based on the letter I'm on
 struct: or everytime you get a row
 struct: you can loop the string that was given to you
 richardM72: Sure but the program needs to know what part of that row contains the "E" row for example. Won't I need to tell it where to find E? (And every other possible character)
 struct: you get the first row
 struct: you print the top of every character you were given
 struct: then you go in the second
 struct: you do the same
 struct: should work
 richardM72: "you print the top of every character you were given" Doesn't this require the program to know what the E looks like for each row (for example)
 struct: if you have the entire row
 struct: you know how it looks for every char
 richardM72: But what you print changes in each test case so the program must know to
 richardM72: I can do it but 27 cases sounds tedious
 struct: if this was given
 struct:  #  ##   ## ##  ### ###  ## # # ###  ## # # #   # # ###  #  ##   #  ##   ## ### # # # # # # # # # # ### ### 
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee73cfd4-8e7e-410d-a626-c56390c3d6d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ee73cfd4-8e7e-410d-a626-c56390c3d6d3</a>
 struct: thats an entire row for the 26 chars
 struct: now you loop the string
 struct: and you can find which part you need for each character
 struct: if you do this for every row you solved the puzzle
 richardM72: I get that part, now keep in mind I must print "E" in the first test case and "Manhattan" in the second, how does the program select the right indices without 26 cases or ifelse explaining what the letters look like in that row?
 struct: you get the charValue
 struct: int charVal = T.charAt(j) - 'A';
 struct: then you substring from the row to get the chars you want
 richardM72: T does not contain a definition for charValue
 struct: Which language?
 richardM72: C# charAt() I mean
 richardM72: also splitting the word into letters isnt the issue
 richardM72: I just use .Split()
 richardM72: elaborate on "and you can find which part you need for each character" from earlier. How do you find which part you need without 26 switch cases?
 struct: you know that A == 0
 struct: B == 1
 struct: and so on
 struct: so you do
 struct: You get the index start of the substring of row
 struct: and the end
 struct: like
 struct: row.substring(charVal * L, charVal * L + L);
 struct: L is the length of each ascii art letter
 richardM72: Exactly, so I need 27 cases to cover all possibilities switch(letter) case A: if(row == 0) Console.WriteLine("###"); etc.
 struct: that wont work
 struct: Because you will get this sometimes as input
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3c2a1cd-6fe9-430a-bdc1-6beeb4c810d3">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c3c2a1cd-6fe9-430a-bdc1-6beeb4c810d3</a>
 struct: It would not work for this solution
 richardM72: it builds the string row by row so it works for multiple letters
 richardM72: nested for loop
 richardM72: Im trying to figure out how to avoid writing all of that. i might not be clear. Give me a second to explaina  little better
 richardM72: I'm given row 0 which contains the top row of all characters out of 5 rows. I want to print just the E portion. I know its position in the row but I cant hard code it because next case will ask me to print something else. How do I show the program where to find each and every character without 27 conditional statements
 FBF_Luis: richard, you can get the order of the character with an ascii table
 FBF_Luis: like struct is saying, a=0, b=1,...
 richardM72: then offset by the width?
 richardM72: for the entire range
 FBF_Luis: if you have the order, you also have the indexes you need for each letter
 FBF_Luis: and the indexes are always the same for every row
 FBF_Luis: for A you always print from 0 to L
 richardM72: do I need to manually assign the value for each letter? ex. A= 0, B= 1 like you said
 FBF_Luis: for B you always print from L to 2L
 FBF_Luis: no, there is a command
 FBF_Luis: c#, right?
 richardM72: Yes
 richardM72: The command isn't explained in the the goal or rules, what command returns 0 for A?
 richardM72: That seems to be what i'm missing.
 FBF_Luis: try int('A')
 FBF_Luis: should be 65 if I'm not mistaken
 richardM72: dang, Typecasting and parsing both fail
 FBF_Luis: and (int)'A'&#160;?
 richardM72: Ok that worked, was using a string and not a char
 FBF_Luis: yeah, the <i> are important</i>
 richardM72: That should solve most of my issues, thanks
 FBF_Luis: np
 FBF_Luis: look for an ascii table to know how much you should offset
 richardM72: Strangely it wants an @ symbol for the 4th test but doesn't give me that in the row
 richardM72: Unless what the row feeds me changes which each test (which would also break this solution since order matters)
 FBF_Luis: in case the "letter" is not a letter, you should print the question mark
 richardM72: Lol thanks, that is such a dumb rule but thats doable haha
 FBF_Luis: there is an option next to test cases where you can see the inputs and expected outputs&#160;:)
 richardM72: Ok I hate to do this but one more question. I'm offsetting based on the ASCII number. Now I need to check each number to make sure it is within the range of usable characters or print&#160;? right?
 FBF_Luis: you're overcomplicating it
 FBF_Luis: you are offsetting by 65, right?
 richardM72: yes, 65 to 90 for all Letters
 FBF_Luis: yeah, but you do int('letter') and you get a value from 0 to 25, correct?
 FBF_Luis: sorry, int(´letter´)-65
 richardM72: Tracking so far
 FBF_Luis: so if you do not get a number between 0 and 25, it means it wasn't a letter
 FBF_Luis: and you should print the&#160;?
 richardM72: Gotcha, thank you for putting up with my insanity
 jacek: :tada:
 FBF_Luis: don't worry about that, it's how we improve
 FBF_Luis: I nag other people all the time xD
 richardM72: I might need to take a short break, been on this site for awhile lol
 FBF_Luis: probably, take a break and get back in a while
 FBF_Luis: and good luck for the puzzle&#160;:)
 richardM72: lol ty
 DJZombieStopwatch_6dec: Could use some help with Sum of Spiral's Diagonals.  I have passed all but one of the test cases, which is the fourth one.  Has anyone here completed the program in Java?
 TheBlueBias: :hotsprings:
 jacek: is it timeout?
 Arridian: So, If I have an array of objects, and every object has a variable in it? How can I find the object with the most of that variable?
 Arridian: In the array
 Arridian: Probably can be phrased better, lol
 struct: javascript?
 Arridian: Python, but if you have a way in JS I coudl probably figure out how to do it in python
 Arridian: The only way I can think about is using a for loop, and just going through
 Arridian: And being like "if bigger than biggest, make biggest"
 TheBlueBias: I guess that if your object has a &lt; comparator, you can just use max() on the array, or something;

 Arridian: okay, ty
 struct: The answers are kinda old though
 Arridian: How would I apply that in my case? With objects and classes?
 struct: maybe this answer?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/59110176">https://stackoverflow.com/a/59110176</a>
 Arridian: Oh, awesome, thanks.
 Arridian: That looks perfect
 Arridian: Oh, that just returns whatever one of their sizes is biggest.
 Arridian: I need to find the actual object so I can use it later
 Arridian: I can use a for loop I guess to to use that then.
 struct: I would go with the for loop yeah
 Arridian: Yeah, that worked.
 Arridian: Still didn't beat wood 2 boss,&#160;:) but it worked, lol
 struct: which game?
 Arridian: Oh, ghost in the cell.
 Arridian: My bot only makes one turn a move anyway, so that is why he beat me
 Arridian: I haven't coded the multi move yet.
 Arridian: Honestly, I'm not sure how to program multiple moves in one turn.
 struct: on first league its only 1 move per turn
 struct: I think
 Arridian: It says I can do multiple now.
 struct: ah
 Arridian: Would it work if I did print without new line?
 struct: MOVE from to ammount; MOVE from to ammount;
 struct: I think it needs to be like that
 Arridian: I know, i'm not sure how to code that in python tho
 struct: so if you have multiple  actions in a list
 struct: you can then do
 struct: join(";")
 Arridian: Oh, Okay
 Arridian: Thanks!
 Arridian: Could someone look at my code for the factory game, it is working find up till the end, because when it beats the enemy it breaks, and says list index out of range.
 Arridian: I can't figure out why
 Uljahn: you can use debug print
 RoboStac: that usually means you aren't handling the enemy having 0 factories and waiting for the final units to fight
 Arridian: Okay, thanks robo stac!
 Arridian: That helped a lot
 Arridian: It still happens sometime. For some reason. But it happens less now? idk why
 Arridian: It only happens like 1 every ten times
 Arridian: before it was every time
 Arridian: Fixed!
 Arridian: Okay, now it works great, thanks guys!
 Uljahn: :tada:
 Arridian: The boss still beats me, lol
 Arridian: But at least no bugs
 XxShruthikxX: lol
 fnflover123: hi could someone look at my code
 fnflover123: plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
 fnflover123: :sob:
 struct: anyone here doing icpc challenge?
 struct: I have a question regarding the statement
 Wontonimo: fnflover123, what code?  I just logged in.  If you are still around ping me
 TechnoBot: bruh
 Wontonimo: double bruh
 Wontonimo: oh, sorry: "ɥnɹq"
 Wontonimo: hey struct, have you tried <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/escaping-the-cat</a>
 struct: nope
 struct: hi
 Wontonimo: hey hey
 Wontonimo: are you doing the icpc challenge?
 struct: not yet
 struct: i was reading the statement
 Wontonimo: is that the satellite problem?
 struct: ye
 Wontonimo: does it seem interesting to you?
 struct: not my style
 struct: But I might give it a try
 struct: euler seems to be 12th
 TechnoBot: bruh
 TechnoBot: #double
 Wontonimo: (╯°□°)╯︵ ɥnɹq
 Arridian: I was in a clash and I had no clue what it was or how to do it, it was a reverse but it just made no sense. The tests were just random numbers.
 Arridian: It was like 130 = 9 131 = 10 2424212 = 142
 Wontonimo: first digit * 2^0 +second digit * 2^1 +third digit * 2^2 +
 Wontonimo: etc
 Wontonimo: nope, that's not it
 struct: Wontonimo did you read the icpc challenge statement?
 Wontonimo: nope
 struct: I cant understand one part
 struct: "Nodes also have their internal structure. As shown below, some edges inside a node cannot communicate with each other because these edges (constrained edge pair) are not fully connected. For example, edge 5 and edge 7 inside node 2 cannot communicate with each other, and therefore flows cannot pass through node 2 by traversing the two unconnected edges."
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://espresso.codeforces.com/454bec55b222afb86814623cc1e85f23247361d0.png">https://espresso.codeforces.com/454bec55b222afb86814623cc1e85f23247361d0.png</a>
 Wontonimo: it means that node 2 isn't a "real" node, but just a physical thing.  In that physical thing it connects 5 and 6, and connects 5 and 11.  and connect 11 and 7
 Wontonimo: but does not connect 6 to 11 or 7
 Wontonimo: and does not connect 7 to 5 or 6
 Wontonimo: etc
 Wontonimo: so, i'd represent 2 as a physical device, and then inside create 'connections' of 5-6 , 5-11, 7-11
 Wontonimo: and the fact that 5 and 7 both connect to 11 does not allow them to talk to eachother
 Wontonimo: i think
 struct: I see
 struct: tyvm
 Wontonimo: np
 struct: i was reading inputs now
 struct: and it makes sensse
 struct: The next ConstrainedCount lines contain information about the edge pairs that are not connected in the specified nodes of the network. All other edges are connected to each other by default. Each line contains three integers: NodeID, EdgeID1, and EdgeID2.
 struct: exactly what you described&#160;:)
 struct: 2 5 72 6 72 6 11

 Arridian: I just found out the hard way that you can only use one side of a dictionary in python
 Arridian: rip my 25 letter long dictionary
 Arridian: Is there a way to grab from the other side?
 Wontonimo: you can use the other side
 Wontonimo: what were you trying to do?
 Arridian: Convert letters to their corresponding word
 Arridian: aka, A=0 B=1, so on
 Arridian: I made a whole program already, lol
 Wontonimo: &gt;&gt;&gt; a = {'b':7, 'c':8}&gt;&gt;&gt; list(a.values())[7, 8]
 Arridian: Thats not what I meant.
 Arridian: I wanted to find "b" if I know "8"
 Wontonimo: &gt;&gt;&gt; z = dict([ (v,k) for k,v in a.items() ])&gt;&gt;&gt; z{7: 'b', 8: 'c'}
 Arridian: okay, ty
 Wontonimo: make a reverse dict like that
 Arridian: Okay, that works
 Arridian: My code was just broken anyway, I didn't understand the prompt.
 Wontonimo: it only works if the values were unique in the original dict
 NamKL: lo cc
 NamKL: lo cais cc nha chung may
 Arridian: I am so bad at clashes, lol, half the prompts don't make any sense to me.
 NamKL: fuck you
 Wontonimo: ban please
 NamKL: you so stupid
 Wontonimo: struct SeebOmega&#160;?
 NamKL:&#160;??
 NamKL: f u c k
 struct: done
 Westicles: wont, you should ask to be a mod
 Wontonimo: tanks
 Westicles: need someone in NA
 Westicles: er, if you would like that, of course
 Wontonimo: cool
 Wontonimo: as long as there isn't a quota of hours or something
 struct: lol
 Wontonimo: did you give up on escaping the cat Westicles, or just lost interest for a bit?
 Wontonimo: a community success rate of 21% is kinda brutal for "medium"
 Westicles: as Blaise so eloquently said, the worst they can do is say "You don't deserve to work for us voluntarily anymore!"
 Wontonimo: haha!
 Arridian: Who is Blaise?
 Westicles: I having tried it yet... saving it for a rainy day
 Wontonimo: yeah, i hear that
 Wontonimo: Blaise is someone who has been on CG for a long time and is good at multis 
 Arridian: Oh, cool.
 Wontonimo: he is also on the FR channels
 Westicles: well, technically was on CG...
 Wontonimo: ah
 struct: being a mod with so few commands is painful 
 Westicles: can you really not unban, or is that just said so people leave you alone?
 struct: I cant
 Wontonimo: wow
 Wontonimo: that is painful
 Wontonimo: that makes ban pretty bad
 struct: yeap
 miszu: what are the expectations to be a mod?

 ChickenCoder123: hey guys what challenges do you recommend me doing
 Wontonimo: are you open to something not involving chickens?
 ChickenCoder123: maybe
 Wontonimo: i see you tried the pod racing game.  Did you want something else, or more help with that?
 ChickenCoder123: yea i was kinda frustrated wit that
 Wontonimo: like maybe something like connect 4, or a space battle
 Wontonimo: what was frustrating?
 ChickenCoder123: i tried connect four for a while but failed miserably
 Wontonimo: ah
 Wontonimo: what was it about the pod racing that frustrated you?
 ChickenCoder123: i didnt really know what logic i should use 
 Wontonimo: what did you try?
 ChickenCoder123: i had no idea what to try
 Wontonimo: oh, you got to bronze.  that's pretty good
 ChickenCoder123: in which one
 Wontonimo: in the pod racing game
 ChickenCoder123: youve done it as well right&gt;
 ChickenCoder123:&#160;?
 ChickenCoder123: whr did you get
 Wontonimo: i'm in legend
 ChickenCoder123: ...
 ChickenCoder123: damn
 ChickenCoder123: training bots to play games isnt really my thing
 Wontonimo: oh.  how about a puzzle then?  have you tried any of the easy puzzles?
 Wontonimo: (easy puzzle here are kinda hard)
 ChickenCoder123: like which one
 Wontonimo: i made one :D
 ChickenCoder123: oooh
 ChickenCoder123: lemme try
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/fax-machine</a>
 ChickenCoder123: it doesnt seem to hard
 Wontonimo: yeah, I got some similar feedback elsewhere :rolling_eyes:
 Westicles: There is a list of all puzzles.  You can sort by success ratio to judge difficulty

 ChickenCoder123: oh thanks
 Wontonimo: today i learnt a new link
 Wontonimo: thanks Westicles
 RC0D3: hi
 Wontonimo: :wave:
 ChickenCoder123: btw wontomino, if u use \n, is it the same as using another print 
 ChickenCoder123: for example, is using print("hello \n poop") the same as print("hello), print("poop")
 Wontonimo: yes
 ChickenCoder123: god i finally finished
 ChickenCoder123: i made it way more complicated than it had to be lmao
 eulerscheZahl: "(easy puzzle here are kinda hard)"that's new to me. I always had the opposite impression: a hard puzzle here would be considered medium on codeforces or hackerrank

 Jasher: hi
 kaka.pops: hi
 kaka.pops: i coding now
 kaka.pops: pls don't distrube me 
 kaka.pops: thanks
 jacek: oO
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey jacek, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 16 tacos
 jrke: oO
 5DN1L: Automaton2000 do you oO?
 Automaton2000: and it can be used
 DaNinja: no talking, kaka.pops is coding!
 5DN1L: And you just did :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 DaNinja: oops&#160;;)
 5DN1L: kaka.pops offline now
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: not even sure if it would be fine
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Automaton2000 10 tacos. Automaton2000 now has 51 taco. jacek now has 17 taco
 Automaton2000: if you cant do it
 DarkSkull_5316: manden juego pa aprender python suave
 5DN1L: English only please
 struct: jacek taco
 struct: jacek :taco:
 antiwonto: [auto] struct has awarded jacek 10 tacos. jacek now has 27 taco. struct now has 15 taco
 struct: sorry I forgot how to do it
 ItsNotABug: My old account got 14,500 rank in pod racer. But I lost access to that account. So now I figure it might be time to re-write again. See if I can slowly chip away at figuring out all the nonsense maths again
 jacek: math in mad pod racing?
 ItsNotABug: yeah, for calculating positions. Lots of angles
 struct: ItsNotABug you cna always check magu_s tutorial
 struct: It shows how to code it
 BenjaminUrquhart: is -3vel still semi-relevant 
 ItsNotABug: Surprising thing is recurse is top with python? How'd that happen?
 struct: its c++
 BenjaminUrquhart: I think he made a c++ bot and used python to launch it
 BenjaminUrquhart: for the meme
 ItsNotABug: lol. Explains it
 ItsNotABug: I like python, but I never expect it top in these
 jacek: he should have used bash
 jacek: 14,500, is this silver
 ItsNotABug: Yeah. 14,500 is silver
 ItsNotABug: New bot is bronze atm
 MrDKOz: Anyway to access my code from the Spring Challenge even though it's over?
 5DN1L: yes, click ACTIVITIES &gt; COMPETE &gt; CONTESTS &gt; VIEW REPORT
 MrDKOz: Awesome, thank you&#160;:)
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 therealbeef: Out of frustration with the failure in the contest, I rewrote my uttc bot from scratch, and finally making promotion to legend
 therealbeef: channeling that rage hehe
 5DN1L: üéâ
 burnpanck: same here&#160;:-)
 therealbeef: which game are you working on?
 burnpanck: spring-challenge '22; got my NN-guided MCTS bot to train a few hours after the contest ended...
 burnpanck: after losing almost all weekend optimising the compile-time so it would stay below the compilation timeout of the arena
 therealbeef: ah nice approach
 burnpanck: my favourite, ever since that AlphaGo paper came out&#160;:-)
 struct: How well does it play?
 struct: do you have a replay of it?
 burnpanck: no - I never got it to work during the duration of the contest. I'll try once it's available as a regular bot game.
 therealbeef: I had spent months tweaking my UTTC bot using alpha-beta, never got higher than #7 in gold. rewrote it to lame MCTS (no solver, not really speed optimized, random rollout), and it just blows gold boss away... embrace MCTS
 putibuzu: wow you got it tow work :open_mouth:
 burnpanck: what is UTTC again? my MCTS currently uses standard upper confidence threshold to select moves - sounds awfully close...
 therealbeef: ultimate tic tac toe
 therealbeef: another game
 therealbeef: ah been typoing UTTT
 therealbeef: sorry
 burnpanck: ah, right - is it on CG?
 therealbeef: yeah, i think it was an old contest as well
 Salticid: I was thinking it must be a variation on UCT (upper confidence bounds over trees, a variation on MCTS) - thanks for clarifying.&#160;:)
 jacek: is there anyone in legend in UTTT with good old alpha-beta?
 therealbeef: it should be possible with a really good eval function
 putibuzu: @burnpanck if I remember correctly you mentioned your NN gets as input the monster-hero distances, right? how do you handle the fact that the number of monsters varies? sorry, I'm curious about your approach
 struct: I think dbd r has minimax on uttt
 struct: but I might be wrong
 therealbeef: i like how they named the gold boss MightCarlo
 jacek: i wonder if i used minimax with the nn eval how good it would be
 struct: How long would it take you to code it?
 jacek: probably under hour. mostly copy paste from other codes and adjusting
 burnpanck: @putibuzu: The NN design is such that every mob-hero pairing is treated exactly the same; that is the features are an (n_mob,n_hero,n_feat) matrix; the NN then does "point-wise convolutions" (i.e. dense on each pairing separately). The only link between different mobs/heroes is though aggregation across all mobs/heroes. 
 burnpanck: variable sized matrices are oviously no issue in C++. for training, I leverage the new RaggedTensors in TF.
 struct: do you use avx?
 putibuzu: @burnpanck: ah ok that's interesting, thank you very much&#160;:) 
 burnpanck: I hope so&#160;:-) that is, I use pragma "-O3" and use static loop bounds in the matrix multiplication (where possible; i.e make sure the mobs are the outermost dimension). hence also the many template instantiations and thus the trouble with the compile time...
 burnpanck: re avx...
 jacek: you use variable inputs?
 struct: is o3 enough to enable auto vectorization?
 burnpanck: tbh, I'm not sure, but I thought it did
 JFB: If sb wants another contest I suggest kaggle (example game replay: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-36493960">https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-36493960</a> )
 jacek: maybe try target arch
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops", "omit-frame-pointer", "inline")
 struct: no avx2?
 struct: no fma
 struct: o.o
 jacek: probably arch=native and tune=native will take care of it
 DopamineAddict: Is there a forum for spring Challenge 2022, want to know about the legends leagure strategies that was used
 burnpanck: thx for the tips! I should probably throw the bot code onto Godbolt at some point anyway

 Ninja184527: Hello
 JFB: jacek - your #pragma moved my very old uttt from #218 to #182. Not very impressive position any way but good as the result of only 3 lines copy/past&#160;:-)
 jacek: how much speedup?
 JFB: I do not know - and I have had // #pragma GCC target("avx")// #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,omit-frame-pointer,inline,unroll-loops"  already 
 TobiasA: you know how you ca do this in python x = [i for i in range(10)]. I there a way for me to do that in c++
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey TobiasA, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 struct: what does that code do?
 _NikJ: for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) x[i] = i;
 jacek: list comprehension?
 _NikJ: my mistake, it's i = 1; i &lt;= 10
 TobiasA: yea list comprehension
 struct: x[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
 Dasohneplan: can anyone help me with 'There is no Spoon'?
 _NikJ: You could do generate or transform on vector, but I guess that's ugly af, it might be prettier to use use a loop or predefined like struct said
 Dasohneplan: can i also do it with a 2d Array or is that to much?
 jacek: maybe lambda?
 cegprakash: just read _Royale's post mortem
 cegprakash: he has done GA
 cegprakash: omg omg
 cegprakash: he finished legend #55

 tutubalin: "The Armstrong number is called a number. If we multiply each number by the power of the number of numbers, it becomes equal to that number."
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey tutubalin, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 tutubalin: This is a CoC puzzle statement!
 tutubalin: Are there any punishment to those who approved such puzzles?
 abt8601: wow so many numbers
 jacek: should be reverse
 tutubalin: it definitely a number of numbers
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/8081d29cd8a7cd42f325070c2b86ec5047ea">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/8081d29cd8a7cd42f325070c2b86ec5047ea</a>
 5DN1L: Approvers: a Level 8, a Level 9, and a Level 17 who seems to be offline for quite a while now
 5DN1L: And their approval comments...
 tutubalin: we need to approve approvers
 tutubalin: and approver of approvers is called approver.
 abt8601: :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: that'S a lot of numbers, tutubalin
 Link_jon: approverer?
 tutubalin: eulerscheZahl a number of numbers
 tutubalin: Link_jon&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: Zahl is German for numbers
 eulerscheZahl: *number (singular)
 eulerscheZahl: perfect nickname for the occasion
 tutubalin:&#160;:)
 Link_jon: a number of numbers... better said as a number of digits?ugh i just got here and my head allready hurts
 Astrobytes: "The Armstrong number is called a number" that's some wisdom there
 jacek: go figure
 eulerscheZahl: do people even read their statement before giving it to review?
 eulerscheZahl: and to reviewers read it?
 Astrobytes: I am guessing a "no" to both
 Link_jon: Im... looking at it now...What.the example makes sense atleast
 tutubalin: That's one small number for number, one giant number for numberkind.
 Astrobytes: :D
 Link_jon: XD
 Astrobytes: brilliant
 Link_jon: Hi, I think the description is a little cumbersome. "raise each digit to the power of amount of digits"
 Link_jon: Alonehoc is genius
 eulerscheZahl: "three-digit number"i think we can do better"three-numbers number"
 Link_jon: ugh this makes my head hurt
 Link_jon: cant look any longer
 tutubalin: eulerscheZahl&#160;:)
 tutubalin: and it should mention that three is also a number
 Astrobytes: good point!
 tutubalin: number-three-numbers number
 VizGhar: what a heck? o.O
 Link_jon: dunno..
 tutubalin: it looks like some esoteric language now
 eulerscheZahl: then look at this Link_jon, it will calm you down<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ef/9c/86/ef9c868236b6129e9a984371bf97b787--black-dots-the-black.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ef/9c/86/ef9c868236b6129e9a984371bf97b787--black-dots-the-black.jpg</a>
 jzen: Anyone remember how the positions are rounded in code vs zombies? I have tried truncated and rounded but my sim is still incorrect
 eulerscheZahl: i would give you mine but it's also off a bit&#160;:(
 Link_jon: (uhh ok)
 Astrobytes: could make a decent puzzle, numberlang
 abt8601: Hmm should I edit the contribution to make it not suck as much?
 Astrobytes: I wouldn't. People need to laugh once in a while :P
 eulerscheZahl: can you edit it? i can't, no permissions
 jzen: Can you edit a contribution after it was approved?
 Astrobytes: Yes, if of sufficient level
 eulerscheZahl: you have to play 300+ clashes
 eulerscheZahl: or level29 for any puzzle that's not a clash
 abt8601: I have played thousands of clashes so I can
 Astrobytes: ^ in this case
 Thorcode: the contest really fun
 actualCoderTrevor: By this definition, 101 is an Armstrong number, because 10 is a number and 1 is a number, and 10^2 + 1^2 = 101
 Link_jon: ....reeeeeeeeee
 tutubalin: also 101^1 = 101
 Astrobytes: ah but don't forget, 2 is a number and 101 is a number
 eulerscheZahl: make a new clash about the yet to be defined Armweak number
 jzen: Wouldn't it be 10^3 + 1^3 = 1001?
 Astrobytes: Legweak
 jzen: actualCoderTrevor
 eulerscheZahl: good point
 tutubalin: jzen no, there are 2 numbers: 10 and 1
 actualCoderTrevor: ^
 jzen: Sorry I meant 10^3 + 0^3 + 1^3 = 1001
 jzen: Wait
 VizGhar: Legweak number is number without legs. 6 8 0 doesn't have legs... count all bipods in interval 1-10000
 jzen: I now see I am confused
 actualCoderTrevor: Well 1001 would work
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: :D
 Thorcode: how can you find this 3 months ago puzzle euler
 VizGhar: feel free to steal it astro :P
 VizGhar: :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha all good man, you can keep it :D
 actualCoderTrevor: VizGhar please don't allow it for reverse
 tutubalin: with proper tests it's a decent reverse puzzle
 tutubalin: also with a hint in output sttring
 eulerscheZahl: "how can you find this 3 months ago puzzle euler"parser error
 Astrobytes: I don't get it either.
 eulerscheZahl: i just link to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a> and hope it answers whatever question
 eulerscheZahl: heavy rain outside, including thunder and hail. i gave shelter to the neighbor's cat
 eulerscheZahl: mine doesn't know yet
 Astrobytes: ooh. Do they know each other?
 jacek: betrayal
 abt8601: Author and one approver are of the same school
 abt8601: But this indicator is rather weak
 Thorcode: this clash i thought was approved 3 months ago
 jzen: Thorcode It was, tutubalin just got it in a clash and commented on the poorly written statement
 Thorcode: I can even edit this clash

 eulerscheZahl: yes, the cats know each other. mine hates him. he doesn't care about her
 jzen: Beautiful abt8601
 Link_jon: *insert applause* This is an amazing statement abt
 abt8601: Thanks
 Astrobytes: lol euler, wait til she finds out you've been fraternising with the 'enemy' :D
 eulerscheZahl: 2 enemies
 eulerscheZahl: there's another cat that visits regularly
 eulerscheZahl: but the 2 intruders get along well with each other
 eulerscheZahl: some initial fighting but they have an arrangement now

 abt8601: Here is the old one if you still want to have a laugh
 Astrobytes: hah! I had "King" Bart from a few doors down who used to come into the kitchen and casually eat my cats food and/or wait at the back door to be let in
 Thorcode: i still have the old  one
 Astrobytes: He stopped eventually
 j4at: I didn't try bot programming yet. I have a question, I see that people uses ML methods(from reading the chat) Those can require hours/days of training. Do they train it offline&#160;? If yes how&#160;?
 jacek: only some of the top people use that. they wrote their own game simulators, play on them and learn from them
 j4at: okay&#160;:)
 jacek: for example there is alphazero-like tutorial for oware <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/58137</a>
 eulerscheZahl: i had that "King Bart" too. now the cat door is electronic and checks for the chip before granting access
 jacek: hmm, do playground articles work for you?
 Westicles: site still running slow?
 eulerscheZahl: was annoying when i was sleeping in bed at night, with my cat on top. and then i heard him eat next door (so did my cat)
 Astrobytes: lol, yeah good move with the electronic catflap
 jzen: jacek Not for me
 Astrobytes: works for me jacek
 eulerscheZahl: but it doesn't work properly in winter
 eulerscheZahl: it opens for my cat but never closes again
 Astrobytes: hahaha, slight design flaw
 eulerscheZahl: gets better: it's blocking the way out
 jacek: well it keeps loading for me&#160;:\
 eulerscheZahl: turning the house into a cat trap
 eulerscheZahl: but the neighbor's cat is fine with that
 Astrobytes: I imagine it is!
 MSmits: hey guys
 MSmits: I kinda missed the contest. But I just played my 3 games vs professor X
 MSmits: (oware)
 eulerscheZahl: how did  it go?
 Astrobytes: hey MSmits, yeah I also got my email
 eulerscheZahl: 3 times tie?
 MSmits: Made exactly 1 error in each game&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: damn
 eulerscheZahl: human error or bot error?
 MSmits: so out of 400+ moves total
 MSmits: no, bot erorr. The opening 48-37 seed positions are based on meta mcts
 MSmits: i did not make a single error after that
 Westicles: the ide seems to be broken
 MSmits: so my database is validated at least&#160;:)
 Westicles: fix it mods
 Astrobytes: nice, well done MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: so you lost the games but gave him a strong fight at least?
 MSmits: yeah I think I was his best opponent so far
 eulerscheZahl: did he write anything in chat?
 MSmits: yeah we chatted a bit. 
 MSmits: nice guy
 eulerscheZahl: also: not sure if you would have liked the contest game. a few years ago when you were new: definitely (code royale days)
 eulerscheZahl: but the total opposite of a board game
 Astrobytes: haven't scheduled mine yet, need to finish the app lol
 MSmits: yeah I did code to bronze league btw. Just on friday i think
 eulerscheZahl: i had a hard time motivating myself
 eulerscheZahl: not my kind of game. but i wanted legend. and then i couldn't just stop after going that far
 eulerscheZahl: laggy chat is lagging
 Westicles: all the puzzles are dead
 MSmits: the game actually seemed interesting and i kept telling myself to code for it
 Link_jon: i see this too...
 MSmits: but I was playing a 32-player tourney in solaris and i won that.
 Astrobytes: gg
 MSmits: so I am semi-ok with missing contest, but not entirely
 Astrobytes: you can always do the multi
 eulerscheZahl: human or bot tournament?
 MSmits: this is human. strategy game, strangely enough. No bots
 eulerscheZahl: and you (supposedly) missed codejam
 Astrobytes: not scriptable at all?
 Astrobytes: I was asleep 
 MSmits: not really, though the devs are working on AI for people who leave the game
 MSmits: I know it's strange, i havent actually gamed in like 6 yrs before this
 MSmits: but it sucked me in a bit&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: it does seem pretty good
 eulerscheZahl: this? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623930/Solaris/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623930/Solaris/</a>
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: they have a turnbased version and realtime. I prefer turnbased as you can then be on equal footing if you have a life
 eulerscheZahl: oh, windows :poop:
 MSmits: but the 32p i won was real time. Let's just say i did not get much sleep
 MSmits: it's also browser based
 MSmits: solaris.games
 MSmits: dont need steam
 Astrobytes: yeah, turn-based is the best. Pick up where you left off 
 MSmits: you have 24 hrs to make your move
 MSmits: move(s)
 eulerscheZahl: i just don't want to pick up on a time consuming hobby
 MSmits: yeah, i am not trying to get you guys into the game. Just letting you know where I've been at&#160;:)
 jacek: mhm
 eulerscheZahl: if you are willing to miss the first CG contest in a year for it, it must be good
 jacek: and last
 MSmits: well, it's good, but I have this obsession with winning... that's the main reason.
 MSmits: once i start...
 Astrobytes: Competitive spirit :D
 jacek: so you lost in oware due to opening?
 eulerscheZahl: team up with jacek
 eulerscheZahl: you take over mid-game
 MSmits: yes, first game i played perfectly to ply 28
 MSmits: then made an error on 35, was solved on 40
 eulerscheZahl: did professor X tell you that you made an error?
 eulerscheZahl: or did you analyze it afterwards?
 MSmits: afterwards, but i know it really soon, my meta mcts is running while playing the game, i see my score go down&#160;:(
 MSmits: my first few moves i have millions of visits and then 10-20 moves in it goes down to 50k or so and i start to have few enough visits that i cant be sure
 jacek: you need more confidence
 MSmits: indeed
 jacek: it means even deep meta mcts cant be that trustworthy
 Smelty: lol
 MSmits: i had several lines of play that would have certainly led to a draw, that i have explored more than enough, but he did not pick those 
 eulerscheZahl: clever of him
 MSmits: But I can let go of the worry that maybe my database has errors. 300 moves played i db and no error
 TabulaRasa: Hi all, I have naive question, when do you think will spring 2022 challenge show up in bot programming games?
 MSmits: I thought this happened the next day?
 Astrobytes: yeah, that's very cool MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: should come back soon, we don't know the exact day
 Astrobytes: Thibaud said within the week
 MSmits: He suggested we meet up in Amsterdam where he is based btw
 eulerscheZahl: also don't forget about the survey
 MSmits: might take him up on that
 TabulaRasa: thanks @Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: Oh nice MSmits, please do
 eulerscheZahl: raise your voice for bot contests
 j4at: :raised_hand:
 jacek: and play on real oware board?
 MSmits: yeah if he is serious about it I'll go over there
 MSmits: i suck at oware lol
 Astrobytes: I think he would be serious about it
 eulerscheZahl: drag him into Onitama
 MSmits: I'll mention codingame for sure
 Astrobytes: I bet I get destroyed when I get around to scheduling my games
 MSmits: You never know, you could get lucky
 MSmits: just dont make a mistake
 eulerscheZahl: you can get destroyed on CG without a fixed schedule
 MSmits: =)
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: was it jacek or you that suggested this challenge Astrobytes?
 eulerscheZahl: jacek
 MSmits: Thanks jacek
 Astrobytes: yeah jacek
 MSmits: it was exactly what i wanted 
 jacek: who's jacek, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i just dont know what to do
 Astrobytes: possibly no better way to test your seed db&#160;:)
 MSmits: yeah, I verified it against itself, but there's nothing better than an independent db that has been tested over and over against others
 Astrobytes: Absolutely.
 MSmits: what kind of program will you use Astrobytes?
 MSmits: Do you also have a DB?
 Wizard-Dude: Hello, in legends of code &amp; magic they say that there are three different locations a card can be , in the players hand, on the players side of  the board, and on the opponents side of the board. What is the difference between on my hand, and on my side of the board?
 eulerscheZahl: hand: you can play it
 Astrobytes: No DB Msmits, but my modified offline version performs better than my CG version
 MSmits: no difference
 MSmits: oh
 eulerscheZahl: board: you have to summon it first (costs mana points) before playing the card
 MSmits: i was thinking onitama sorry
 Wizard-Dude: oh thanks! 
 MSmits: Astrobytes cool. I did have an endgame db generator shared if you have time to give it a try
 MSmits: I just misses movement generation and such
 MSmits: (have to input your own sim)
 Astrobytes: oh yes, I forgot about that
 Astrobytes: thanks!
 MSmits: you can easily generate 20-25 seeds
 MSmits: 36 seeds took me 3 weeks though
 jacek: if your modified offline generator performs better, why dont you put it on CG :v
 Astrobytes: yeah I remember you doing it
 yhyoxx: is there a relationship between heuristics and finite state machine&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: finite statemachine uses heuristics to move between stateds
 MSmits: heuristics are if/else conditions basically
 yhyoxx: is the best way to make a heuristics bot implementing a fsm&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: flying spaghetti monster?
 MSmits: not sure if fsm is usable in most arena's
 eulerscheZahl: couldn't resist
 Astrobytes: :D
 yhyoxx: nice
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 MSmits: but you can use ideas from fsm
 yhyoxx: like last contest, my biggest problem was design
 eulerscheZahl: that was CG's problem too
 yhyoxx: and there were only a few states
 eulerscheZahl: that's how we got an escape
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 yhyoxx: haha
 yhyoxx: true
 yhyoxx: wth was that contest 
 yhyoxx: training some model&#160;?
 MSmits: oh btw, this was the endgame map for my solaris tourney: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://solaris.games/#/game?id=6249df7f1985eaebf8353f45">https://solaris.games/#/game?id=6249df7f1985eaebf8353f45</a> Me being dark blue
 eulerscheZahl: did you win anything?
 MSmits: eh an ingame badge :P
 Astrobytes: nice
 eulerscheZahl: you are Innoble?
 MSmits: yeah, havent you seen me on discord
 eulerscheZahl: as MSmits
 eulerscheZahl: i left CG discord long ago
 MSmits: you invited me for that special channel
 eulerscheZahl: then i just forgot
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: can you have different names for different discord channels?
 Astrobytes: the special channel will only really become useful if/when this chat disappears
 MSmits: i mean as a user
 MSmits: ohh ok,is it a backup chat?
 Astrobytes: essentially, yeah
 MSmits: because we didnt know what was going to happen with the merger?
 Astrobytes: Pretty much. That and the getting rid of the webchat plan
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 MSmits: is that still happening?
 MSmits: or unclear?
 eulerscheZahl: paused A/B testing, they had a bug
 eulerscheZahl: testing should continue soon
 MSmits: did they want to integerate discord in the page?
 MSmits: integrate
 Astrobytes: No
 Astrobytes: You can't embed discord afaik
 MSmits: I have no idea
 eulerscheZahl: iframe?
 Astrobytes: ew
 MSmits: are iframes deprecated?
 MSmits: what is a web dev supposed to use instead?
 Astrobytes: I don't think they're as widely used as they were, just for specific things
 MSmits: ah ok.
 Wizard-Dude: Hi, I got an error saying timeout on Legends of Code &amp; magic, What does this error mean?
 MSmits: I use them sometimes
 MSmits: Wizard-Dude your bot uses too much time
 eulerscheZahl: you don't print a line of output
 MSmits: possibly because you don't print yeah
 MSmits: (under some circumstances)
 Wizard-Dude: oh, I think that is the problem! Thanks&#160;!

 Link_jon: run it and you
 Link_jon: 'll understand lul
 ZndrBrok: Hi guys, do only i have problem with CoC right now&#160;?
 ZndrBrok: I don't see the score of people who finished
 ZndrBrok: and when i quitte to play a new one
 [CG]Keelhaul: No, the issue is being investigated
 ZndrBrok: i never get notified about the ranked after the 15 minutes
 ZndrBrok: shiieeet
 eulerscheZahl: today in "guess the language"is it Lua?
 ZndrBrok: i need to pass an interview on codingame :P
 ZndrBrok: i hope this bug will not be related with the "pro" part of the site :P
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl it reminded me of vba but different
 MSmits: the "end" thing
 MSmits: but no brackets
 Astrobytes: yeah it's Lua
 ZndrBrok: @Keelhaul thank you for the information&#160;!
 j4at: Clash of code results are pending for the last 30 mins
 j4at: :grimacing:
 j4at: nvm
 Astrobytes: scroll up
 Link_jon: currently failing to clash and aaggh
 Link_jon: it hurts
 Link_jon: what i wanna know is how ppl instantly finish clashes
 eulerscheZahl: they just click submit without solving it
 eulerscheZahl: that's the fastest way
 Link_jon: 100%?
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they already know the clash then
 eulerscheZahl: only 1500 or so to choose from
 eulerscheZahl: 1787 in my database
 jacek: flash clash
 jzen: eulerscheZahl Finally fixed the CvZ sim
 eulerscheZahl: in all situations?
 jzen: At least the ones that were failing before&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i had this weird case where the zombie would have to go horizontally (?) but the y changed and he moved further away by 1 unit
 eulerscheZahl: too long ago, i can't recall exactly
 eulerscheZahl: if you like reversing, try the CG sponsored contest
 jzen: Seems like I already submitted something
 jzen: Oh wait, it just spits out a random valid answer
 jzen: But I'll be sure to make an actual attempt at some point
 VizGhar: its optim... In optims it should be easy to print valid answer... just not optimal enough
 Dapps: I just read bowwow contest PM. I just didn't understand what type of search did he use in attack?
 eulerscheZahl: Bender 4 :see_no_evil:
 eulerscheZahl: chokudai?
 eulerscheZahl: that's like beam, but with fixed depth and increasing width
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/nQQQa8">https://ideone.com/nQQQa8</a>
 Dapps: oh interesting
 eulerscheZahl: that snippet contains 1 or 2 bugs btw
 eulerscheZahl: HStates[t+1].push(NextState);
 eulerscheZahl: and don't return a state from depth 0
 DustinNunyo: Hey guys! I am doing the Fall 2020 Challenge. I have this idea to approach the problem like a Chess AI. The problem is it's a bit out of reach for me at the moment. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I might do to improve?
 eulerscheZahl: how do you approach a chess AI?

 cegprakash: yaaay
 cegprakash: finally solved code vs zombies
 Mindarius: I feel like this shouldn't be legal in shortest: exec(bytes('Êµ©ÊΩ∞Áë≤Ê¥†Áë°‡©®‚±∑„µ®ÊÖ≠‚°∞Êπ©‚±¥ÁÅØÊπ•„Ä®‚§©ÁÄäÊ•≤ÁëÆÊ¥®Áë°‚π®ÊΩ£Êâ≠Áú®Ê†´„à≠Áú¨„Ñ≠‚§©','u16')[2:])
 antiwonto: [auto] hey Mindarius that looks like python golf compression.  It's legit, and acceptable to use.  You may be interested in this tool <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/">https://clemg.github.io/pythongolfer/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Opponent eval: 1ms, score: MUDA"
 cegprakash: but my rank is pretty low :P 
 cegprakash: I don't cre
 cegprakash: I saved human race
 DustinNunyo: Well, I assume it's a recursive algorithm that goes multiple levels deep and examines the board state across many different board state but that bit is the part that is a little fuzzy for me. I know you can also do stuff like alpha beta pruning to sort the list of board states and not check certain board states but that is about all I know.
 cegprakash: I saved human race and got 100%
 cegprakash: don't care how many zombies I kill
 Link_jon: OH
 Link_jon: i now see how he was able to finish in under a minute
 Link_jon: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ea96cc0-38d3-47b3-a05a-40306152c369">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ea96cc0-38d3-47b3-a05a-40306152c369</a>
 Wontonimo: DustinNunyo , for a chess AI use alpha-beta ( or minimax or negamax , all same family ) or use MCTS
 Wontonimo: A beam search could work if you have a really good eval
 Wontonimo: if you are not familiar with minimax, start there.  Google it, watch some youtube videos
 DustinNunyo: Well, the game says that MCTS is in the "related material" so I assume that is probably one of the better ways to approach the problem.
 DustinNunyo: I'm sort of familiar with it but I am not sure how to implement it.
 Wontonimo: yes, MCTS will most likely beat minimax but it is a bit more advanced
 Astrobytes: not sure why it says MCTS when almost everybody used beam search for that contets
 Astrobytes: *contest
 Wontonimo: which contest?
 eulerscheZahl: fall 2020 was the witches cooking, wasn't it?
 Astrobytes: 2020
 DustinNunyo: I know that it plays the best move possible for you then the best move for you opponent and checks multiple levels deep and tries to find the best end result assuming your opponent plays all the best moves.
 eulerscheZahl: even the winner used beam search
 eulerscheZahl: there is little opponent interaction
 Wontonimo: Fall 2020 Challenge&#160;?  yes beam search is the way to go
 DustinNunyo: Aaaah, alrighty, I will check into that.
 jacek: start to learn minimax or mcts on sequential game. that game is simultanoues
 jacek: + doesnt have much interaction between players
 Wontonimo: ChokudaiSearch beam search is just a trick to do a beam search of width 1, then 2, then 3, etc until you run out of time.
 eulerscheZahl: C# has no priority queue in the library&#160;:/
 VizGhar: Startup multi approved? Is it any good?
 jacek: yeah, has best graphics ever
 Wontonimo: I looked at it.  It's not my thing
 eulerscheZahl: never again joke about my artwork
 Wontonimo: that link you sent eulerscheZahl <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ideone.com/nQQQa8">https://ideone.com/nQQQa8</a> seems to be missing something to increment ChokudaiWidth
 eulerscheZahl: no
 eulerscheZahl: you have a priority queue of reachable states for each depth
 eulerscheZahl: then as long as you have time, you take the one with the highest score and generate the next states from it
 cegprakash: how is the score computed in code vs zombies? I have to save all humans?
 eulerscheZahl: the width just allows you to expand a few nodes before moving to the next layer. keeping it at 1 is fine
 cegprakash: I saved 1 human in every game but seems like I only got 33K score
 Wontonimo: ah, I'm mistaken then.  thanks
 cegprakash: but I need 40K for unlocking optimisation tree
 jacek: save 1 human to pass a testcase
 DustinNunyo: Anyway, thanks for the heads up guys! I am going to go back to reading material now. lol
 Wontonimo: well, optimize those kills cegprakash
 KYel: Actually, PriorityQueue was added in C# with .NET 6 introduced
 cegprakash: I've to kill the zombies or save multiple humans what's the goal Wontonimo
 jzen: Scoring works as follows:A zombie is worth the number of humans still alive squared x10, not including Ash.If several zombies are destroyed during on the same round, the nth zombie killed's worth is multiplied by the (n+2)th number of the Fibonnacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on). As a consequence, you should kill the maximum amount of zombies during a same turn.
 eulerscheZahl: wait, really? how could i miss that
 jzen: Sorry for big paste
 eulerscheZahl: such a game changer
 jzen: Thought it would pastebin

 eulerscheZahl: finally
 cegprakash: fibonacci wew
 eulerscheZahl: now i just have to wait 2 or 3 years until CG, topcoder, codejam and all those update the language
 NewCoder09: in code vs zombies i have 649 lines of code in C and im ranked 216th with a 223930 score im proud of myself
 cegprakash: and I need to save multiple humans&#160;:\ And I thought ash and just 1 more human can save the human race
 Astrobytes: I think anyone tasked with saving the human race should learn to read statements :smirk:
 DustinNunyo: Would it be beneficial to learn how to do a BFS algorithm first for beam search? because I actually need to write a BFS/Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm for another project I am working on.
 Astrobytes: Yes. Very helpful
 VizGhar: BFS first yes
 cegprakash: if u keep asking me read problem statements I'll make more twitch streams on how to solve problems without reading the statement Astrobytes
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: :D 
 DustinNunyo: Are there any algorithms that you guys might recommend before BFS? lol
 jacek: DFS
 cegprakash: sorting
 Astrobytes: DustinNunyo:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a>
 DustinNunyo: I'm a pretty decent coder but not really a very good programmer as I am finding out. lol
 Dapps: Convex Hull
 DustinNunyo: Alrighty thank you guys! I will check those out!
 cegprakash: don't check convex hull Dapps is kidding. it's for advanced
 DustinNunyo: It's funny because I've actually implemented A* before but for some reason BFS and DFS are just hard for me to wrap my head around. lol
 jacek: or try some easy puzzles <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/very-easy/space-maze">https://www.codingame.com/training/very-easy/space-maze</a>
 Dapps: haha yes i was j/k&#160;:) 
 Dapps: i don't even understand it
 DustinNunyo: convex hull huh? lol
 DaNinja: super easy Space Maze
 eulerscheZahl: the 2nd onboarding puzzle, as we call it
 Astrobytes: the 1st of course being Nintendo
 gaha: Just shared my post mortem for Spring Challenge <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/55">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/55</a>
 gaha: 8th place, using 3x attacker strategy
 eulerscheZahl: i know, i hated your bot in particular :P
 Dapps: I hated all shooters lol
 gaha: it was so fun to shoot though
 eulerscheZahl: game rules were unbalanced
 Dapps: i just accepted it as part of the game
 Dapps: it shouldn't have been linear though, each additional hero should've moved it less far
 DaNinja: Euler was this what space maze was based on? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.myabandonware.com/game/stone-age-1iq/play-1iq">https://www.myabandonware.com/game/stone-age-1iq/play-1iq</a>
 gaha: sure, it'd make sense
 eulerscheZahl: it was something with a car you had to steer
 eulerscheZahl: a yellow beetle i think
 eulerscheZahl: later levels also had keys that melted ice blocks
 eulerscheZahl: making that part of the map passable
 eulerscheZahl: i've spent hours searching it and also asked my dad who installed it in the first place
 eulerscheZahl: but no luck
 DaNinja: it doesnt ring a bell
 eulerscheZahl: i think it was on water rather than in the space
 Smelty: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: with rafts
 eulerscheZahl: afk for a while now
 cegprakash: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 jacek: addict?
 cegprakash: there are just 21 test cases
 cegprakash: so it runs 21 times
 cegprakash: not my fault

 cegprakash: I close CG
 cegprakash: can't test 
 cegprakash: can't submit
 jacek: oO
 Westicles: br2k is tough, I'm stuck at the top of wood5
 MSmits: Westicles yes, it's designed to be tough
 MSmits: I never got into the top league
 DomiKo: Getting out of Wood 3 is hard enough&#160;:(
 MSmits: Yeah it was
 Westicles: I was going to try to advance to all the woods possible (51 left to go) but I'll skip that one
 Westicles: and chess
 jacek: no :cheese: for you
 HenroLST: huh
 MSmits: Westicles the games made by the community aren't real wood leagues
 MSmits: they are harder, sometimes much harder
 MSmits: ex-contests are generally easy, except that ocean game
 Westicles: yeah.  I think I have solved all the easy ones, except maybe fireworks... can't read all that
 Westicles: though now that they are going to make the community puzzles into events with leagues, everything will change I guess
 MSmits: this is a good way to try all the games and see if there's one you lik
 MSmits: oh, where can i read about this?
 Westicles: thib talked about it on chat, let me try to find it
 MSmits: ok

 0zBug: :rage:
 0zBug: :rage::rage::rage:
 [CG]Thibaud: :eyes:
 MSmits: thanks Westicles
 [CG]Thibaud: o/ hello&#160;:)
 jacek: captain on the bridge!
 Astrobytes: hi Thibaud
 Astrobytes: leagues for community games could be interesting/fun
 [CG]Thibaud: what I am a bit scared of, is that it will earn CP just like a regular challenge
 MSmits: are you afraid it will be unfair because people already know these games?
 MSmits: thereby having a headstart?
 [CG]Thibaud: this and also the risk that it remains a small event with 1k players top
 Astrobytes: Yes indeed
 MSmits: well it depends on how much you advertise it. You get huge amounts of players for these official contests
 MSmits: how do you make that happen?
 Astrobytes: that's a lot of resources though
 MSmits: yeah i tis
 MSmits: i think we have some community games that really deserve more attention. like eulers graph game
 jacek: graph game :thinking:
 Smelty: j,,
 <b>**MSmits waits for the mention of paper soccer</b></p><p><img src="/a/75369242083208" /> jacek: i didnt
 [CG]Thibaud: yes, it's great for the visibility of the games
 Astrobytes: also, I worry about the difficulty of some of the games; I mean it goes from 0..100 required skill level somewhat steeply in a lot of the board games for instance
 Smelty: hmm
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm still the one who select games
 MSmits: this is true, some are hard to get started in
 Astrobytes: Though, I guess with enough players at different levels/leagues it could still be a fun and interesting experience for most
 Astrobytes: just back to that "getting enough players" issue again though
 jacek: and how would new leagues bosses be created? like in contests?
 Smelty: interesting
 therealbeef: you could favor relatively new community games, to mitigate the problem of having many people with really good bots already at start
 jacek: well board games have few hardcode players from the start
 MSmits: therealbeef that may help a bit, but it usually doesn't take more than a month for bots to be as good as they will be
 MSmits: so that would mean *really* new
 Astrobytes: or at least in the ballpark
 therealbeef: so maybe spot one during review phase and then release it as an event
 MSmits: that could be good 
 Astrobytes: definitely a lot of potential, might take a few tries to get running smoothly
 therealbeef: e.g. let reviewers 'nominate' good ones, so it's less work for CG
 MSmits: Hey Astrobytes did you create a game before?
 MSmits: I'm not sure
 MSmits: darkhorse did
 Astrobytes: MSmits: no I was going to but other stuff took over, still on the list
 MSmits: ahh ok
 Astrobytes: Morpion solitaire/join-five
 MSmits: sounds good
 jacek: darkhorse?
 struct: just make jacek bots as the wood boss
 Smelty: ^
 Link_jon: ^
 Kaelidian: is it just me or is python the best language for clash
 Smelty: its definitely good for shortest but dunno
 Link_jon: idk i see alot of people playing with snakes in clash. a few gem hunters too though.Then theres people like me that live on the moon lul
 Smelty: lul
 Nakotathepro: hello
 Link_jon: hai
 DustinNunyo: ugh... recursion is aweful!
 snoyes: you can say that again
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 gaha: Actually, how are bosses created in the contests right now?
 Wontonimo: they were users
 Astrobytes: it's automated since this last one, previously they were chosen manually by CG staff
 Wontonimo: ^^
 DustinNunyo: lol Anyone got an tips for breaking the recursive algorithm barrier?
 gaha: I think Gold Boss was not deterministic which I didn't really like
 eulerscheZahl: looks like i missed some chat
 eulerscheZahl: "i think we have some community games that really deserve more attention. like eulers graph game"
 Wontonimo: recursion can always be turned into a loop plus a stack
 eulerscheZahl: whatever update it was caused a buggy viewer
 Wontonimo: so think of your recursion as a stack DustinNunyo
 gaha: imo having deterministic boss is important to be able to fix bugs in the code
 DustinNunyo: @Wontonimo I think I kind of understand what you are saying It's just really hard to wrap my head around.
 aCat: yeah it helps a lot
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I think previously they checked for that but apparently the automated version doesn't 
 aCat: but bosses for lower leagues were deterministic, it may be that for legend it is not
 Wontonimo: hey DustinNunyo , so when you are calling back on a function what is really happening is you are pushing the current variables of the function onto the callback stack.  well ... no need to do that
 aCat: to not help too much with overtuning
 gaha: yeah, I think they all were except for the last boss
 eulerscheZahl: they tried to find deterministic ones for higher leagues too
 eulerscheZahl: and lower = deterministic can be by chance
 eulerscheZahl: how many players use random in lower ranks?
 DustinNunyo: @Wontonimo yeah, higher order functions also did my head in until relatively recently... lol
 Wontonimo: instead make a data structure DustinNunyo and push that onto a stack.  The data structure is what would have been the local variables of the funcgtion
 Wontonimo: what's your programming language DustinNunyo
 DustinNunyo: I am most comfortable in python but I can use a few others in a pinch.
 Wontonimo: give me a couple min and i'll try to make an example
 DustinNunyo: Thank you so much man! I really appreciate it!
 Wontonimo: hmm ... i'm going down a rabbit hole.  Before I go further, tell me about the recursion problem you are attacing
 Nakotathepro: hello everyone
 DustinNunyo: Well, the ROOT of it is that I need to calculate a flow field for a game that I have been working on for a few years. For that I need to understand either Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm for the integration step but I was having trouble with it so I decided to get back to basics and try strengthening my ability with recursive algorithms.
 Link_jon: noice?
 Link_jon: Also hai
 DustinNunyo: As for what I am working on right this second; I am working on a DFS puzzle trying to get better at recursion. lol
 DustinNunyo: death-first-search-episode-1
 Link_jon: lul. Good luck with that.M currently playing with bots and seeing what lua --cant-- can do
 Link_jon: indexing a nil value is a very constant problem XD
 DustinNunyo: Ultimately I am hoping to go from DFS to BFS to Dijkstra's
 Link_jon: ooooo
 cclaude42: Hey everyone! I have a question about the /home roadmap
 DustinNunyo: nil values?
 DustinNunyo: I haven't ran into that yet.
 Link_jon: nil == NULL (but nil is Lua)
 DustinNunyo: It's looking like I might have to keep track of when I cut a link.
 cclaude42: I finished Legend on the contest, but it didn't unlock the Legend level in bot programming. Will it unlock eventually&#160;?
 DustinNunyo: Well yeah, lua, was actually my first language. I just haven't ran into any nil values being passed in on this puzzle yet. Then again, I am only on the second level.
 Link_jon: ... Huh i just had a thought. Claude, check to see if your score still exists
 cclaude42: My score&#160;? You meant the codinpoints&#160;?
 Link_jon: err. in the leaderboard itself
 cclaude42: Yeah still 82nd
 Link_jon: *shrug*might just not be updated yet
 Astrobytes: when the codinpoints are added/updated you'll get the achievement
 cclaude42: Maybe it's strictly bot programming. When do they usually move a contest to regular bot programming&#160;?
 cclaude42: I have the codinpoints already :o
 Astrobytes: it will be there within the week
 Link_jon: Also,im having absolute PAIN whenever working with tables in tables and variables to index those tables, not sure why
 Astrobytes: oh they updated the CP?
 cclaude42: I have it, yeah
 Astrobytes: but either way, you'll be in Legend when it comes back
 cclaude42: Reached Master ranking :D
 cclaude42: Niceee it's my first time, stoked
 Astrobytes: and it should be here within the week Thibaud said
 Astrobytes: and gratz&#160;:)
 cclaude42: Thank you :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I snuck in two 'private' contests, got N/A for CP, I wonder if they are used in the CP 5% degredation?
 Astrobytes: no you don't get any CP for those at all, doesn't factor into it whatsoever afaik
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I gained +3k cp, and lost +2k cp on the 5% degrading for a net of +650 CP, very disappointing
 Link_jon: sad
 MichExpatMatt: I gained 133 CP overall since April 16, but I lost 157 profile rank in the same time period&#160;:(
 MichExpatMatt: Leaving every time I joined a clash that turned out to be annoying probably hasn't helped
 Astrobytes: also clash CPs decay
 MichExpatMatt: yeah
 PatrickMcGinnisII: clash points deca... yea fairly quickly
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I barely know what I'm doing half the time T-T
 Link_jon: ^
 Astrobytes: in general or on here? :P
 MichExpatMatt: but within the first couple days of the spring contest... my CP shot up and cracked the Master category for the first time. One day later... the point increase vanished like it was never there
 MichExpatMatt: maybe it was just a calculation error on their part
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Anyone try 'Start-Up' multi?  I'm a little confused...it is a ML game?
 jacek: cant you tell from its graphics
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I feel like I'm the only beginner here
 eulerscheZahl: something definitely broke, was working before&#160;:(chromium (left), chrome (center), firefox (right)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/CVqFc5s.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/CVqFc5s.jpg</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the warriors show the circle on top, which should only be visible in debug mode. and the color of one player does not change
 Astrobytes: SDK update?
 Astrobytes: or viewer rather
 eulerscheZahl: not sure yet
 jacek: mhm
 VizGhar: thatonedreamsmpfan2.0 I was beginner too 1-2years back :P just enjoy yourself
 eulerscheZahl: and when i reload, settings don't get saved
 eulerscheZahl: that used to work as well
 MichExpatMatt: Everyone was once a beginner at anything they do. Don't sweat it! Personally I am just here for fun and to learn a thing once in a while
 eulerscheZahl: and i don't even think that i can file a bug report, as i did so much things that i weren't supposed to do
 cclaude42: Yeah we're all beginners at some point :D
 eulerscheZahl: wasn't*
 MichExpatMatt: (despite my talking about points and ranks)
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: But it's so hard, I can barely enjoy myself&#160;:(
 jacek: "That" - she
 VizGhar: thatonedreamsmpfan2.0 and what exactly are you doing? go for easy puzzles
 jacek: like galaxy labyrinth
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I am, It's still hard because I've just gotten into coding
 Link_jon: What language are you using?
 MichExpatMatt: I regularly look things up on geeksforgeeks, stackoverflow, and a few other sites while trying to figure out puzzles/challenges. I've done DFS and BFS numerous times for example, but I seem to always forget the algorithms
 Astrobytes: MichExpatMatt: try this site for solidifying your pathfinding/graph knowledge a little<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a>
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I think I'm using a language called Go, I really don't know the difference between the different languages for coding
 MichExpatMatt: Astrobytes oh nice! I think I used one of those examples when I was working on the Captain Kirk maze thing earlier this year, but I hadn't bookmarked it so I lost it and didn't realize how many other things were on the site
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl looks like it works in my Firefox 99.0
 Astrobytes: MichExpatMatt: Yeah it's a great resource, the interactive/animated parts are very useful too. Very in depth in parts but you can take as little or as much of it as you need
 Link_jon: You might have an easier time starting off with a simplier language (but... learning a more weird language earlier will help get used to... the pain.)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Waterfox (64 bit) stopped working correctly months ago... but FF 32 bit works fine...wierd huh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops WF works on the replay
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: Link_jon: pain is an understatement
 eulerscheZahl: PatrickMcGinnisII if you reload the replay, does it save the settings (debug mode, custom colors, ..)?
 Link_jon: Yes...i enjoy sticking to the Lua/Python combo instead of the only 'proper' language i know: C++
 eulerscheZahl: with the latest SDK version: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/r4b0iuS.png">https://i.imgur.com/r4b0iuS.png</a>only lost the bottom bar, i expected much worse
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl nope, none 
 eulerscheZahl: same for me, used to be working&#160;:(
 MichExpatMatt: In college I was doing mostly C++ up until graduating 2007 and today I don't remember it, I'm mostly C# and very spoiled by it. But in college my favorite instructor said things like "if you know algorithms, languages are just syntax" and "if you can do it in C++, you can do it in any other language"
 eulerscheZahl: custom color for you makes no sense if it doesn't save between replays
 Link_jon: pretty much yeah
 MichExpatMatt: which to me sounds kind of like "I've had Mickey's, so I could drink anything"
 Link_jon: small problem
 Link_jon: i dont forsee a Lua remake of Doom
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I can't believe I want to code games but I can barely figure out this puzzles t-t
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: *these
 Link_jon: (wait what was Doom even coded in)
 jacek: i dont want math, i want to program computers!
 Link_jon: I mean. I think thats how most of us felt and or continue to feel sometimes.
 Link_jon: or maybe its just me
 Link_jon: What puzzle is it
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: in my opinion, math should be illegal, but sadly we still need some of it for coding
 VizGhar: You cant code without math
 jacek: or meth
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: XD
 Link_jon: eehh thats just the motivator
 Link_jon: then theres meth math and thats a whole nother story
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: lmao
 VizGhar: I've heard about some guy taking controlled amount of LSD... And he solved some pretty darn hard problem... you guys know more?
 Link_jon: ...Rather explosive, usually.Am curious now, what puzzle was it ur fighting with
 VizGhar: I want to read the story :P
 Astrobytes: I don't think microdosing is all they say it is tbh
 VizGhar: yeah thatonedreamsmpfan2.0 what is that you cant solve?
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: everything  t-t
 Link_jon: send the link
 VizGhar: we wont help you then
 VizGhar: If you need to cry, find other place. If there is anything to ask, then ask
 Astrobytes: :D
 VizGhar: We are willing to help but there is no way as you can see
 Astrobytes: On point
 VizGhar: "Hey I want to buy something""What should it be?"
 VizGhar: now on point&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: heh heh heh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl hmm, looked at source... would take forever for me to break it all down ... but looks like server side session would be necessary ... but on reload, CG is sending a static CSS ... so while authentication may be handshaked, i dunno on replays...I doubt more overhead is utilized because setting stuff in the browser could inject into the JS locally by malicious people...so they probably closed the hole.
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: there are different problems in a puzzle and I can't figure out how to make all of them stay correct when I switch to figure out another a different one t-t
 Astrobytes: That's a very roundabout way of saying "I have no idea" Patrick :P
 Link_jon: aka the best way
 Link_jon: Ah, dont hardcode your way through the puzzle
 Link_jon: make an algorithm that takes the input, and converts said input to the correct output
 jacek: so... NN
 Link_jon: Theres allways a pattern
 Astrobytes: to jaceks trolling?
 DomiKo: new challenge. Make NN to predict jacek :D 
 Astrobytes: lol
 Waffle3z: automatonnn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Astrobytes i have clue. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: i think changing the CSS with JS is okay locally, but it's safer for CG to bump to default Doc.  of course, the YT player controls might not be spanning due to the addition of .mobile support .... yea ok, I'm guessing... but it's not being saved
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap got dr. appt. in 30 minutes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: I'm only good at the conditions puzzles, my life sucks 
 5DN1L: yeah, life is full of conditions puzzles
 Astrobytes: :D
 thatonedreamsmpfan2.0: sadly
 Nakotathepro: who is a girl on here
 jzen: You, judging from your picture
 Link_jon: probably only you seeings the silence
 eulerscheZahl: by that logic Astrobytes is a cat and 5DN1L just yellow
 jzen: Wait... You are not a frog?
 eulerscheZahl: a toad
 jzen: Sorry
 Link_jon: ul
 Astrobytes: lol
 jzen: I see that I have offended your being
 jacek: First important fact ‚Äì all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads!  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://wildlifepreservation.ca/what-is-the-difference-between-toads-frogs/">https://wildlifepreservation.ca/what-is-the-difference-between-toads-frogs/</a>
 pmor: I thought on the internet the men are boys, the boys are men, and girls are fbi agents
 Astrobytes: correct jacek
 jzen: Good to know jacek
 jzen: pmor Where does that leave the toads?
 jzen: The FBI agents are toads?
 pmor: if they are girl toads
 Unkn0wn225: I need help with changing thors direction f movement cause im new
 5DN1L: cause you're new in what?
 5DN1L: new to CodinGame and new to a programming language are different, for example
 Link_jon: jacek: so frogs are rectangles and toads are squares?
 jzen: Link_jon the other way around
 Link_jon: Ahh yeh
 Kaelidian: c# is terrible for clash 98% of the time
 eulerscheZahl: an update to the latest SDK at least solved the issue of warrier and circle being shown at the same time for chromium
 eulerscheZahl: but it looks like any toggle with more than 2 possible states doesn't get saved
 ycsvenom: Kaelidian i think c# is terrible as you said because it's slow ,terrible and broken intellisense 
 MichExpatMatt: One of the reasons I started trying to learn python
 MichExpatMatt: Also in C# I was trying to do the code golf for Don't Panic #2, I've made my code illegible but it's still only down to 447 chars :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L: Don't Panic #2?
 MichExpatMatt: Yeah there is a challenge for the second Don't Panic puzzle, where the goal is not just to pass all the tests but to get code size &lt;200 chars
 MichExpatMatt: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf/don&#39;t-panic">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf/don't-panic</a>
 5DN1L: That's Don't Panic #1
 5DN1L: "This is a rather special programming challenge. This is the same problem as ¬´&#160;Don't Panic - Episode 1&#160;¬ª, an medium puzzle, but instead of simply solving it, now you need to do so with the least possible amount of characters."
 MichExpatMatt: ahh, my bad. Sorry, I haven't worked on that one in months now so I misnamed it by mistake
 5DN1L: No worries&#160;:)
 5DN1L: Just wondering whether you wanted to challenge yourself to code golf #2 too :P
 MichExpatMatt: idk, maybe once I get better at python
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' …•«ùllo '
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: that last bit triggers me, oh well.
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry jacek but you can only award tacos once per day
 jacek: :rage:
 derjack: :taco: jacek
 antiwonto: [auto] derjack has awarded jacek 10 tacos. jacek now has 37 taco. derjack now has 44 taco
 wlesavo: in Block the spreading fire the last validator is random and the seed for test is fixed right?and other test cases coinside with validators?
 Westicles: The 'random' ones are always the same, if that's what you mean
 Westicles: I think confusion over this resulted in the 1-star rating... he thought it changed every time you submit
 Westicles: sad
 DomiKo: 1-star is correct rating for this puzzle
 jacek: huh
 Westicles: oh, maybe so... I haven't tried it
 DomiKo: me too, I just read the statement
 wlesavo: oh, thats sad
 wlesavo: i thought that number of test cases seemed to be quite low
 VirtualRealityRocks: how is the clear rate for the onboarding puzzle only 85% XD
 Wontonimo: because people think this is an intro to programming for total noobs and then freak out and run away
 VirtualRealityRocks: it literally gives you code to copy in
 5DN1L: Doesn't mean they necessarily follow it through
 VirtualRealityRocks: I suppose

 PatrickMcGinnisII: where's my :taco:
 jzen: :taco: PatrickMcGinnisII
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry jzen but you need 3 tacos to give tacos.  You have 0 now.  Get someone to give you more tacos first
 jzen:&#160;:(

 Frostyhot: how do i learn to code
 DustinNunyo: @Frostyhot YouTube is probably the best place to start of you have absolutely no experience in my opinion.
 DustinNunyo: They might have super beginner friendly lessons on here but I am not sure.
 DustinNunyo: I haven't looked at the really simple stuff.
 PoisonousBerry: Im tring the Power of Thor, how do I combine the conditions? I cant seem to get him to go diagnal

 cegprakash: nopes..
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Frostyhot personally I buy the books for the language I wanna dive into.  then google is your friend for lang. docs.  Lotta free IDEs, CG is great for hands on experience.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: if (code_addict==1) redirect...lol

 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: how to hack NASA
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they all use apple
 Mortis_666: $sudo hack NASA
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :sweat_smile:
 Mortis_666: üòÇ
 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: can i hack NASA by python
 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: im a pyton pro
 DEV-thien: yes.But you must hack python 1st
 PatrickMcGinnisII: They have a .50 cal machine gun emplacement at the entrance, so stay between the pylons
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ffs I haven't been to KSC in 15 years
 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: ok bro
 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: so im gonna hack NASA with html
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I installed stuff in the clean rooms when they were sending up pieces of the ISS
 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: i can hack yor phone bro
 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: watch out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hack my car via satellite like the govt. does
 LongDepTraiYeuRatNhieuEm: wait 2m
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hint: there's a "by Microsoft" tag on the computer
 PatrickMcGinnisII: There's more than 15M vulnerable vehicles sold from 2008-2019 and no recall nor fix for it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: shut all of them off but mine k
 DustinNunyo: Hey guys, can anyone confirm if it is possible to solve the death first search puzzle using python?
 DustinNunyo: I am considering re-writing my code in C++ but I would like to avoid that if I can.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: do a 1-time djkistra and make a shortest distance matrix on first turn, should b fine
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, i guess it depends on episode
 DustinNunyo: Well, I was trying to do DFS as it's called "death first search" lol
 DustinNunyo: episode 1
 DustinNunyo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72fe2483-ee3d-47b5-99b1-4a26fcab389b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/72fe2483-ee3d-47b5-99b1-4a26fcab389b</a>
 DustinNunyo: that is my code.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did both episodes in php, so yea...doable in PY
 DustinNunyo: hmm... yeah... probably something wrong with my code then.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: unroll the recursive...do it in loops
 DustinNunyo: aaaah, yeah, my buddy was telling me about that. He said it would speed things up. lol
 DustinNunyo: I thought the @lru_cache was supposed to solve that issue though.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't know enough about PY to tell you, all i got 4 u
 DustinNunyo: Alrighty, well, I was wanting to re-write this algorithm to not use recursion anyway, might as well do it now. lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :v_tone1:

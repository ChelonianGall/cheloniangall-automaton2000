 Darleanow: hello guys&#160;!
 ycsvenom: hola amigo
 Darleanow: whassup?
 ycsvenom: i am really good
 ycsvenom: what's about you?
 Darleanow: i didnt woke up this morning
 Darleanow: guess why
 Darleanow: LARGEST NUMBERS
 Darleanow: and i missed school
 ycsvenom: what!
 Darleanow: i have a test in like 30 mins, i hope my teacher will accept if i do it at home
 ycsvenom: at least you accomplished something
 Darleanow: lmao
 Darleanow: question
 Darleanow: if i try to print lst[n-1]
 Darleanow: it gives the last
 Darleanow: but if i want the one just before the last, can i print lst[n-2]&#160;?
 ycsvenom: if you want to take the last element of collection in python you just have to:
 ycsvenom: lst[-1]
 Darleanow: yeah odeed
 Darleanow: indeed
 ycsvenom: if you want the one before that thenlst[-2]
 ycsvenom: and so on
 hxoreyer: take taco
 Darleanow: perfect thanks&#160;!:)
 ycsvenom: you are welcome
 jacek: wait till he learns how to reverse string in python :v
 Darleanow:&#160;:'(
 ycsvenom: he learned it yesterday jacek
 Darleanow: DID I&#160;?
 ycsvenom: yes lst[::-1]
 Darleanow: OHHHH
 jacek: oh my
 ycsvenom: are you in codeforces jacek?
 jacek: no
 Thorcode: what is codeforce?
 ycsvenom: it's a website for problem solving practice which much more hard than this oneand has a rank and contests and many many events
 ycsvenom: but not that perfect gui
 Thorcode: ok?
 ycsvenom: just that
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: hello
 ycsvenom: yello
 Thorcode: is it harder than leetcode?
 ycsvenom: i think so
 Thorcode: really
 ycsvenom: i am not that surei solved just 10 questions on leetcode then left 
 ycsvenom: in leetcode
 Thorcode: code force look isn't really pro in front end
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: yes yes
 ycsvenom: because it's old i think codeforces is the first website for that purposeThorcode
 Thorcode: but the problem kind fun
 ycsvenom: and problem hardness not measured by front end
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: yes thats true
 Thorcode: but it is kinda hard to find the problem
 ycsvenom: not the gui 
 ycsvenom: not the best gui
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: t'habites a Tessain&#160;?
 Thorcode: have you solved any problem on codeforces? ycsvenom
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: oups
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: sorry
 ycsvenom: yes
 ycsvenom: 80+
 Thorcode: hard?
 ycsvenom: no i am trying to solve it from easy to hard
 jacek: so old
 Thorcode: you tried that&#160;? jacek
 ycsvenom: the least problem score is 800 and largest is 3500 i think
 Thorcode: the 3500 kinda hard
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: yes 
 ycsvenom: btw Thorcode your bio should be "a geek avenger" not "an ..."
 Thorcode: ok
 jacek: trolling is a art
 Uljahn: trolling is a art
 Thorcode: wdym
 ycsvenom: trolling is an art*
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: yes 
 Darleanow: xDDD
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: i love trolling
 Thorcode: there is no bio
 Thorcode: coding kinda hard
 Passifi: not if your quiet smart 
 Passifi: or a little on the spectrum
 Thorcode: or p2w
 Thorcode: alot course isn't free unless you spend time on reading book
 FIcusAndLik: :flag_ru:
 Uljahn: no spam here, FIcusAndLik
 Demango: :grinning:
 Thorcode: what's about russia FIcusAndLik
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: I lvoe Russia, Poutine is the best president
 Uljahn: this is not the right place to discuss matters unrelated to coding
 Darleanow: we love them french kids

 Uljahn: why don't you want to learn js data structures and other basics on your own?
 Coockie_dewd: Is C# a good first language?
 vinnie_rinella: i would but codecadmeny is broken for me and all the other sites i found cost money
 Coockie_dewd: alright
 vinnie_rinella: no i would do javascript Coockie_dewd im very biased tho
 Coockie_dewd: Hmm
 Coockie_dewd: alright
 Coockie_dewd: ill try it
 vinnie_rinella: becayse thats all i know
 jacek: maybe CG should cost money too
 eulerscheZahl: maybe you should bills us for your trolling service
 Uljahn: 10 tacos per day?
 eulerscheZahl: i will pay jacek in recycled memes
 jacek: :upside_down:

 vinnie_rinella: ill try it thanks!
 Uljahn: also you'd better learn how to search the web, this skill is crucial
 Nik05: jacek CG costs money, for businesses that use it
 vinnie_rinella: Uljahn is that a threat?
 vinnie_rinella: the way you worded it made it sound like a threat
 Frankich: It's just a really great advice
 Frankich: If you can't search for yourself, you won't going really far in that job/hobby*

 derjack: :upside_down:
 CosmicStudios: somebody rickroll me
 Samuelos: how can I debug
 derjack: print to stderr
 Nik05: You can also use assertions
 Samuelos: thx
 Joosy199: why is python the most popular language i see on here
 Dren: because python is a popular language
 Passifi: Is it not the most popular period&#160;? 
 Joosy199: Is it? I thought at least JavaScript, Java, C++, would be more popular
 Passifi: main reasons are imo easy(relativly) and convenient to use. Now I like my languages unwieldy and challenging thats why I code directly in opcodes
 Joosy199: opcodes?
 Joosy199: Ohhh machine language XD
 Passifi: thats how the cpu gets its commands one layer below assembler
 Passifi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html</a> 
 Passifi: and I think stack overflow does a poll each year where python also dominates
 Joosy199: That's crazy. I've never touched python but I guess I should start
 Wontonimo: that's what she ...
 Wontonimo: where is jacek when you need him?
 5DN1L: :rolling_eyes:

 Wontonimo: :ice: :bucket: :pants: 
 Passifi: right in these progressive times it could have been what he said as well 
 Wontonimo: or them/they
 NewCoder09: for real 
 Wontonimo: that's what he said ...
 a-Rye: that's what Cthulhu said...
 Wontonimo: yeah&#160;!
 jacek: :no_mouth:

 a-Rye: lol, this site just has everything! 
 a-Rye: and that guy streaming earlier was trying a different puzzle from eulerscheZahl 
 5DN1L: yay
 a-Rye: Rectangle Partition, but I'm not quite there yet. Still working on mediums
 a-Rye: Wait no, that's an easy I'm also working on. Blockout was the other eulerscheZahl
 Passifi: I have finished a medium puzzle today, but I don't fully understand my own solution so I went back to easy while feeling like a fraud ...
 Wontonimo: which one?
 Passifi: the one I solved was the rod cutting problem
 Passifi: I had an idea but the solution didn't quit fit in my head, so I just coded it out and crossed my fingers and it worked, but it still feels like I am missing something
 Passifi: frankly that isn't the first time that happened either, I wonder whether this is a common thing for coders.
 jacek: as long a it works...
 Wontonimo: there is a certain satisfaction from having the whole solution crystal clear in your head an you are just typing it out casually, transcribing it from thought to working code right away.  It happens, but
 Wontonimo: it's boring
 Wontonimo: it only happens for the easiest problems for you and since they are so easy it just doesn't even seem like it's worth the effort to type it out since you are 100% sure it'll work.  So embrace the difficulty
 Wontonimo: if it bugs you that you don't fully know why it works, that's a good thing.  Use that to check back in a few weeks and revisit it with fresh eyes
 Westicles: it is common in python for sure
 Passifi: ah the difficulty isn't the problem more the feeling that it was all just a fluke :pensive:
 Passifi: but its a step closer to being better so its still a good thing of course&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: +100 
 Razko: if you're curious though, it might also be worth dropping it into another environment to debug it... from there you can find the spot that is confusing to better understand why it worked... especially since you can control the input rather than having coding games supply it
 a-Rye: ^^Definitely! Between Replit, Eclipse, Visual Studios, etc, you can do local development and build up your GitHub
 Kaelidian: Dude this guy VizGhar has a pretty solid strategy on Game of Drones

 hexa8: eh i might just give up
 ycsvenom: why did you use floor and divisionwhy don't you just use mod?
 hexa8: idk
 ycsvenom: mod is just the reminder of the divisionlike 10%3 is 1
 hexa8: yeah ik
 ycsvenom: and when a number is divisible by n it will you 0 as answer like10%5=0

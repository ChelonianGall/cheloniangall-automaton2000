 VelezArceJ: Hello everyone. I just obtained access to the chat. i hope to learn a lot and hopefully get to know some people. 
 mikroman: Hello
 LetchoHUN: Hey
 SabertheLost: Emm, I just passed the optimization score for Code vs Zombies by just doing x = lastZombieNextX and y=lastZombieNextY.  That gives a score more then 40k.. I do not feel I optimized anything
 jrke: simple start can give you score but for further you need algos which you have to optimize to get better score
 SabertheLost: Yes, but on the achivment track, you only need 40k to pass the optimization track. Also I pass all but 2 of the test with that score.
 jrke: then you have to find what went wrong in those 2 cases
 SabertheLost: I know what is wrong, I just take the last zombie input an goes towards it. That no logic at all. 
 sybtra: Hi!
 sybtra: I am very new here and new to coding
 sybtra: Can anyone help on my exercise&#160;?
 donMan: Hello Syb, What is your need&#160;? 
 Monstrux: hey syb
 Monstrux: how can we help brother? =) Im kinda new too
 XorY: hi guys, could anyone give a hint for the puzzle 'Reverse FizzBuzz'? 
 ParticleBeam: Brute force? Check all combinations of Fizz and Buzz to see if they are consistent with the input sequence?
 XorY: thanks for the hint, didnt think of that. 
 Drakkhonian: breh, finally finished the easy enigma machine
 Drakkhonian: goddamn
 Drakkhonian: am i supposed to find some easy problems actually a bit hard?
 Drakkhonian: or am i just trash programmer?
 Aya_Noaman: calm down bro
 Aya_Noaman: i always feel stupid too
 Drakkhonian: lel
 Drakkhonian: the imposter syndrome is real
 Uljahn: i feel like some easy are medium in disguise and vice versa
 Drakkhonian: yeah, i can see a 4 layer criptography being at lest meduim
 Marchete: I don't understand the "oriented shape" in Blocking game
 Marchete: it says " shapeLetter-[0-1]the flip number-[0-3]the rotate number"
 Marchete: so it seems A##
 Marchete: but suddenly is A###
 Marchete: with numbers even of 5, like 0 0 K015
 darkhorse64: The last number is the tile number that touches the corner you attach the  shape too
 darkhorse64: *to*
 darkhorse64: Don't know if I made it any clearer
 Marchete: sorry, no&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: When issuing your move, you place an oriented shape A##. The tile number x will be placed on (col, row). Movegen is going to be hard to code for this multi and I wonder if it's not going to detract people from it
 darkhorse64: Is it better&#160;?
 Marchete: I still see the statement confusing
 Marchete: I can't see the A### at all
 Marchete: using the simplest piece, 0 0 A001
 Marchete: what's that 1?
 Marchete: also rotation coords, if I flip my piece then coords are negative?, or it's reset to 0 as top first?
 Marchete: I'm still trying to figure the game, with a GUI and a mouse is easy to do it, but in text mode it's harder to do
 Astrobytes: Marchete: the '1' is the number tile from the given shape which will be placed on the coordinates you specify
 Astrobytes: well, the number in that case is '1', but could be any number tile from the shape
 Astrobytes: I think so anyway. It is somewhat unclear in the statement tbh
 Astrobytes: and yes darkhorse64, I think the movegen difficulty will affect the number of participants
 MSmits: hey Astrobytes
 MSmits: I wrote something cool for my course: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2f3651108d">https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/2f3651108d</a>
 MSmits: it has bfs, dfs, can generate a random maze and show the steps of the algorithm. 
 MSmits: for the search that is, not the maze generation
 MSmits: (keys for this are in the introduction tab)
 MSmits: I use it in an iframe, they cant see the code then. It's basically just an interactive animation for the students
 Astrobytes: MSmits nice job man, that's awesome&#160;:)
 andreimushat: hello everyone 
 Astrobytes: hi
 andreimushat: Does anyone know what exactly to do on the power of thor app&#160;?
 Astrobytes: MSmits: do you think it's worth adding a manual step-through option? As well as displaying all steps
 andreimushat: I am brand new here
 Astrobytes: There's a Hint button on the left andreimushat
 Astrobytes: And make sure you update Thor's position when you output a direction
 andreimushat: I'll try, thanks
 ProCoder3: hi&#160;!
 ProCoder3: in mean max , I used SKILL x y command 
 ProCoder3: but i am not able to make my destroyer throw a grenade 
 ProCoder3:  I have enough Rage
 ProCoder3: guys please help me :cry:
 Q12: what is the name of the game?
 Matrix007: is there hint for "CODERS STRIKE BACK" i am just lvl 2  that angle and dist...idk wht to do
 Matrix007: like use trignometry?
 Matrix007: no idea
 ProCoder3: @Q12 it is 'mean max'
 eulerscheZahl: ProCoder3 is the target in range of your destroyer?
 ProCoder3: Yes 
 ProCoder3: it within a 1000 
 eulerscheZahl: share a replay where it goes wrong
 ProCoder3: Okay will share&#160;!!
 uvaishzafri: heheh hasrele rinkiya ke papa
 ProCoder3: sorry guys it was bug (caused by me)!! Now it working perfectly . Thanks 
 ProCoder3: for your help
 TogaCat: Where do you get hints in Coders strike back
 Monstrux: looked for it aswell, didnt find anything&#160;:(
 zenoscave: MSmits your turtle has a bug
 jacek: hints should on the left?
 Skynse: Just submitted my first CoC puzzle
 Skynse: I based it on permutations
 eulerscheZahl: then you got 1 more than me
 eulerscheZahl: "men must sit opposite each other"does that mean the bus has 2 rows facing each other?
 Skynse: not necessarily but yeah
 Skynse: It means that no matter the number of seats, the two men must sit exactly adjacent each other
 Skynse: perhaps I should change "opposite" to "adjacent" in the description
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that would make it clearer
 eulerscheZahl: and turn the bus into a bench&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise I have rows with 2 seats on each side in mind
 eulerscheZahl: bench = 1 long line
 eulerscheZahl: and sometimes those permutation task see each individual as different, sometimes they only distinguish between groups (so m1, m2, f1 is considered the same as m2, m1, f1)
 318673: oh what do we do in this app
 eulerscheZahl: with m=male, f=female
 eulerscheZahl: congrats 318673, you just unlocked the chat
 318673: any one what do we do in this app?
 318673: :grimacing:
 eulerscheZahl: which "app"?
 318673: :money_mouth::zzz::drooling_face:
 Skynse: solve code puzzles, compete in bot contests, code with other people competitively
 318673: thank you
 318673: very much
 318673: listen to this

 Skynse: :rolling_eyes:
 Astrobytes: No.
 318673: why to dark:smile:
 318673: sorry wrong song
 Legoracer:&#160;: |
 318673: listen to this it is not dark...   <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ucSeSSwrek:sunglasses">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ucSeSSwrek:sunglasses</a>:
 eulerscheZahl: you risk a kick, don't you?
 318673: ME 
 eulerscheZahl: yes. Does he, Astro?
 Astrobytes: Yes, he does.
 318673: why you say that??
 eulerscheZahl: you are spamming random youtube links
 Astrobytes: Which nobody is interested in.
 Skynse: dang man, you're level 54
 eulerscheZahl: yes, level up with this contribution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/minesweeper-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/minesweeper-1</a>
 Skynse: master :pray_tone5:
 tobk: Just curious, what "quest" comes after "Create your first contribution"?
 eulerscheZahl: "Add to the CodinGame Legacy"get 5 upvotes on your contribution
 eulerscheZahl: and then a free harvest to finish the track
 tobk: Huh, already says "get 5 upvotes" on "Create your first contribution"
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, I read the wrong part of that long block
 tobk: Ah, it says it can be WIP, so I guess that level is about creating a contribution, and the next about getting it accepted.
 eulerscheZahl: you don't only have to create a contribution. it must get approved for the last part
 Skynse: dang, full blown minesweeper animation
 eulerscheZahl: took me a weekend but well worth it :D
 Skynse: Im gonna start off with the easier puzzles, then move up from there
 Skynse: I still haven't figured out mars lander 2
 Skynse: or the mouse and cat one
 eulerscheZahl: i did all hard ones before the marslander 2. even did marslander 3 before 2 :D
 eulerscheZahl: then i gave up my search approach for it and solved it with a few if-else
 Legoracer: mmmmmmmm
 wlesavo: lol, i also strugled with it quite a lot, started it like 4-5 times, and only quest map made me finally do it
 eulerscheZahl: story of me golfing "don't panic"
 Dartisan: For the optimization tree? I have to solve it still under 200 chars in Dart&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: in any language
 Dartisan: Yeah, is a personal challenge, I try CodinGame in only Dart. Is for my training. 
 Dartisan: In the leaderboard I see it is possible, so I have to search. 
 Dartisan: Best in Dart currently 131 chars.
 Dartisan: So my approach in Code is somewhere false.
 Majeck: I'm confused with a CoC
 Majeck: You have to determine the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand
 Majeck: But in the example it says 12:30 -&gt; 165
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know how that 131 was achieved
 eulerscheZahl: might be a system call
 eulerscheZahl: with a shorter bash solution
 Majeck: I'm confused: twelve o clock in the hour hand, and 30 minutes in the minute hand should give 180ยบ, no?
 ParticleBeam: No. Remember the hour hand moves slightly so it weill be between 12 and 1
 Majeck: OHHHHHH
 Majeck: THANK YOU
 Majeck: THANK YOUUUU
 Dartisan: Thanks, I will find, I will invest some time later. Or wait for the next Dart version, they reduce the code from version to version&#160;;-)
 Drakkhonian: hey, anyone know if in this exercise <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building</a>
 Drakkhonian: is it safe to assume it will always be a single circuit given and it will always be valid?
 eulerscheZahl: C# will get better at golfing too
 eulerscheZahl: in C#9 you don't have to write the Main() function anymore. You can just put the code outside of the function/class
 uvaishzafri: hello world!!
 Drakkhonian: print( "Hello World!" )
 uvaishzafri: std:cout&lt;&lt;"Hello World"&lt;&lt;endl;
 Dartisan: Sounds good, than C# makes Python a bit concurrence.
 eulerscheZahl: nah, still far away from python level
 Majeck: Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
 eulerscheZahl: but the lambda syntax is shorter
 uvaishzafri: textview.settext("Hello World");
 eulerscheZahl: P(s)=&gt;Console.WriteLine(s);P("Hello World");
 eulerscheZahl: shorter when you need it again
 Majeck: System.out.println("Hello World!");
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/433923512">https://www.codingame.com/replay/433923512</a>interesting start by StOUb :D
 dbdr: blocking above all
 eulerscheZahl: a few contest bots did that too
 uvaishzafri: ++++++++++[&gt;+++++++&gt;++++++++++&gt;+++&gt;+&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-]&gt;++.&gt;+.+++++++..+++.&gt;++.&lt;&lt;+++++++++++++++.&gt;.+++.------.--------.&gt;+.&gt;.
 eulerscheZahl: but none at the very top
 uvaishzafri: beat this
 Majeck: &gt;&gt; "Hello World"
 uvaishzafri: nah
 eulerscheZahl: 
 Majeck: What language is that?
 eulerscheZahl: Malbolge
 uvaishzafri: you guys do competitive programming?
 eulerscheZahl: rarely
 eulerscheZahl: the annual codejam
 uvaishzafri: on codechef /codeforces?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codechef.com/users/eulerscheZahl">https://www.codechef.com/users/eulerscheZahl</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl">https://codeforces.com/profile/eulerscheZahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: as i said: rarely
 uvaishzafri: CM 
 uvaishzafri: says rarely
 eulerscheZahl: CM?
 uvaishzafri: Candidate master
 uvaishzafri: which you are
 eulerscheZahl: oh. see, i don't even know the acronyms :D
 uvaishzafri: on codeforces
 uvaishzafri: thug life
 Hjax: is this site not competitive programming? 
 uvaishzafri: ya it looks like but problems are relatively easy here
 uvaishzafri: doesn't involve ds and algo
 Hjax:&#160;? clearly you are looking in the wrong place 
 uvaishzafri: why so?
 Hjax: this site is far more about the contests and competitive games than the puzzles 
 Hjax: theres a contest starting in two weeks 
 eulerscheZahl: CG is competitive too. but in a totally different way than codeforces &amp; co
 uvaishzafri: i joined clashes only till now
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/spring-challenge-2020</a>the last contest here on CG
 Hjax: yeah clashes are easy (and boring imo)
 eulerscheZahl: guiding multiple pacmen through a maze to collect the most pellets
 uvaishzafri: yay that looks good!!
 leojean890: did CG delete some accounts or something like that&#160;? I won like around 10 places in every multi in the same time&#160;;) (or detected similar codes and removed some of them for multis&#160;?)
 uvaishzafri: what's the frequency of such competitive contests on CG?
 Hjax: a few times a year 
 Dartisan: Next in 14 days.
 Dartisan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020">https://www.codingame.com/contests/fall-challenge-2020</a>
 Hjax: ^ which is the third contest this year 
 uvaishzafri: that's sad  
 Hjax: you are free to play the games and join the leaderboards of games from previous contests 
 uvaishzafri: i was expecting more number of contests
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 inoryy: uvaishzafri if all puzzles seem easy then I'm sure you've already solved <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/nintendo-sponsored-contest">https://www.codingame.com/training/expert/nintendo-sponsored-contest</a> right?&#160;:) 
 uvaishzafri: lol i was talking about clashes
 Hjax: clashes are just like, an easy warmup thing 
 Hjax: not really the meat of this site 
 Skynse: anyone been able to solve escaping that cat?
 uvaishzafri: yay thanks all&#160;!!
 Dartisan: Clashes is only one part. You Bot and Optimization for challenging and Code Golf for a bit of fun&#160;:-)
 Westicles: One thing I've learned from the videos... clashers appear to be a bunch of weirdos
 Dartisan: Can't believe only 655 persons tried A code of ice and fire. It is a funny one&#160;:-)
 eulerscheZahl: 2160 in the contest
 eulerscheZahl: no idea why so few bothered to resubmit
 eulerscheZahl: now CG moves the whole contest leaderboard directly to the multiplayer section
 Skynse: some clashers are pretty mysterious
 eulerscheZahl: and the others are on twitch
 Skynse: wait then that means I've clashed with a streamer before
 eulerscheZahl: but the adblocker does a fairly good job at removing that button :P
 Dartisan: Oh, that is real a pity, would cost nothing to commit the same code and the people would have twice the points.
 Skynse: or theres a chance that I have given the number of clashes I've done
 eulerscheZahl: #clash
 eulerscheZahl: click that and check the links to be on stream
 Hjax: in two weeks the clashers will be briefly flooded out of chat by everyone playing the contest 
 Hjax: it will be wonderful 
 ParticleBeam: This "easy" puzzle is driving me nuts.
 Hjax: which one ParticleBeam
 ParticleBeam: Graffiti on the fence
 LastRick: love that puzzle, and i would also add one that probably needs its difficulty changed
 Dartisan: It is a tricky one, I tried in first to solve it by array, but as the numbers are Big, I had to switch to logic and compare.
 leojean890: difficulties mentioned with community puzzles are not very accurate.. some hard are easier than some "easy";)
 leojean890: about official puzzles, it's better;)
 leojean890: (way more accurate)
 Majeck: leojean890 agree 100%
 Majeck: ParticleBeam try to solve it with pen &amp; paper
 Majeck: Use that same logic in your code
 Majeck: Do you draw the whole fence to solve the problem when you have pen &amp; paper?
 Dartisan: Yeah, sometimes also the difference between easy and difficult is simply the basic knowledge of an concept, you know already at that point and apply, or you have to build that concept in first.
 leojean890: sometimes yes, for example, no easy puzzles with simulation needed or dynamic prog..
 leojean890: and difficulty is .. subjective about personal experience and knowledge..
 Dartisan: Yeah, started some days ago with Bellmann Theory&#160;;-)
 Dartisan: Say, in my daily work there is no need for this part, but this is also why I like this place, it gives me the playground to pass in these domains.
 jacek: bellmann theory?
 jacek: temporal difference learning?
 Skynse: is remi6 a bot?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING">https://www.codingame.com/leaderboards/clash/global?column=clashescount&amp;value=DECREASING</a>
 eulerscheZahl: bots are with 50k+ clashes
 jacek: remi?
 Dartisan: jacek, I just started, say it is to replace my recursive approaches by calculated matrixes, for the simply pathfinder.
 Skynse: Not sure if I made a mistake by deleting my contribution but eh
 Skynse: it was a weird one anyways
 Skynse: I mean, at least now I know the work that has to be put into puzzles
 AntiSquid: speaking about leaderboard? dr db keeps rising going for 1st i guess
 eulerscheZahl: doctor database?
 Skynse: you guys ever write code in the moment *sometimes*, then when you look back at it, you wonder how you thought of it so quickly
 th-mas: yeah
 th-mas: you like write a ton then read it and realize you dont even understand what you wrote :P
 Drakkhonian: and <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building</a> done completely
 Drakkhonian: was it supposed to take me over 4 hours to do tho? lol
 eulerscheZahl: let's see if i can do this faster
 jacek: can you make game in 2h?
 Skynse: have you been able to solve the cat and mouse one?
 eulerscheZahl: not today anymore, getting tired
 eulerscheZahl: didn't really try the cat+mouse one yet
 Skynse: I want to see if I can use angles, once I figure out a way to make a triangle from 2 coords
 Skynse: my mouse is just too slow
 Drakkhonian: lel, nice to see im not the only one who gets brain farts after programing for a time
 Drakkhonian: mental exhaustion is real
 Skynse: My bed is looking real nice right now
 Skynse: It's calling me
 Skynse: ughhhhh, I have to study a bit before a new topic tomorrow
 AlPaca: ugh
 AlPaca: when you click submit because you want to correct faulting code ... xD
 eulerscheZahl: code is ugly but it passed the equivalent circuit puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: bed time, good night
 Drakkhonian: breh
 Drakkhonian: you did it in 16 min
 Drakkhonian: i feel so unfit LOL
 Cauy: anyone know how to do thor episode 2?
 Uljahn: yes
 Cauy: Would you mind helping me with C code?
 jacek: C?
 ParticleBeam: Finally solved that puzzle. My brain must have been dead.
 zapakh: I know that feeling
 Majeck: Is there any way to get code back after closing my browser :weary:
 Majeck: I lended the computer that I'm using with the IDE open and they closed the browser lol
 Majeck: Should've seen it coming
 philb32: If you go back in your history you should be able to see your session. If it's a puzzle you click Solve and you should get your code back.
 Majeck: Where does it say Solve?
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: I need to complete Don't Panic ep1 and Power of Thor ep2 for my homework by tonight, can someone help? (in C)
 Majeck: Homework?
 Majeck: They're vastly different difficulties
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: I can make a few solutions for dont panic but not one general solution
 philb32: ok, if you go to the same puzzle that you were trying to so, there is a button that says Solve, click this and you will get back to your previous session, I just tried it, Don't Panic episode 1 as it happens&#160;:)
 Majeck: TheNoiselessGhost_65d3 If you're having problems with Don't Panic Ep1 I doubt you'll be able to complete Power of Thor Ep2
 Majeck: When it first ran as a contest even the most experienced coders took more than two hours to complete it 
 Cauy: TheNoiselessGhost are you in ECE.217
 Majeck: philb32 THANKS
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: yes lol
 Majeck: philb32 OH lol
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: I recognize your name
 Majeck: That's just the button to open up the puzzle lol
 Cauy: Do you know how to do any of the codings whatsoever lmao 
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: I mean, yeah, pretty sure i can figure it out eventually but the problem is he gave us 3 weeks to do it and i am just starting
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: he gave me a few extra days because i was gonna be gone
 Cauy: Yeah thor is like 177 lines with only going to case 5
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: my gosh
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: might just take the F
 Cauy: I feel like I am clueless when it comes to this 
 Majeck: Your prof is crazy if he thinks Don't Panic Ep1 is at the same level as Power of Thor Ep2
 Cauy: he doesnt 
 Majeck: I mean Don't Panic Ep1 can even be golfed
 Majeck: Without anything too complicated I got it to under 200 characters in Python
 Cauy: Dont panic is a stepping stone for thor in our class
 Majeck: That's crazy, they're really different
 HelloWorld183L: are programming challenge websites that popular in universities?
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: does he expect us to complete a code for every testcase or can i turn  in one thats hardcoded for like half of them and get an ok grade?
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: This is the first one ive ever taken so im not sure
 Cauy: Just one for all of them
 Majeck: I doubt he'd let you get away with hardcoding
 Majeck: In any case if you were to stoop so low as to hardcode you could just look up the solution online :shrugs:
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: .... Already tried 
 Majeck: For sure thought that :shrugs: was an emoji!
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: I cant find any online in C
 Cauy: What is your first name Noiseless Ghost?
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: its Blake. I think we're in the same building
 Cauy: PC3
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: Dunning building?
 Cauy: Yep
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: yeah i recognized your name from the group chat thing
 Cauy: Ah yeah
 Cauy: What is the flag in your profile pic?
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: on here?
 Cauy: GroupMe
 Cauy: The chat
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: not sure, its whatever the  default image is 
 Cauy: Your Right
 Cauy: You're
 Cauy: It's just a weird background thing
 TheNoiselessGhost_65d3: yeah I never bothered to change it

 Majeck: Two possibilities:1) The puzzle screwed up
 Majeck: 2) You screwed up
 MAKMED1337: 2

 MAKMED1337: no
 Majeck: Oh
 Majeck: ok
 MAKMED1337: it was out of range
 MAKMED1337: in vector

 Majeck: Just play the ones that interest you
 FakeGhost_dd05:  Hey is anyone there?
 zenoscave: No one is here FakeGhost
 Skynse: ask
 FakeGhost_dd05: Hi, it's important. I have a "technical assessment" to do and I need to know what i can expect from it
 Skynse: what do you specialize in?
 TBali: if you are good then a 'job offer'
 FakeGhost_dd05: specialize" java"
 Skynse: what field are you getting assessed in?
 Skynse: or more specifically, what job
 FakeGhost_dd05: Well I'm kinda rusty in java that's why I'm trying to read some stuff. but i wanted to get an idea of what I'm getting
 FakeGhost_dd05: ahh junior java developer
 FakeGhost_dd05: I'm reading the syntax and apllying it aswell 
 Skynse: Well, OOP knowledge is always required, some knowledge on data structures and algorithms, etc
 FakeGhost_dd05: I just want to know what should i expect
 zenoscave: [CG]BOUGA do you know of a way to get trueskill sigma mu values for a score? Are they ever represented in an API? PM me please
 zenoscave: I dont wanna dig where I shouldnt
 FakeGhost_dd05: So should i expect syntax and some problems aswell?
 FakeGhost_dd05: Like these puzzles on this site ( not the same ones ofc)
 Majeck: Well, it depends on the employer
 FakeGhost_dd05: Oh damm
 Majeck: They could ask you anything
 Majeck: Like I've known some cases where you can't code and have to do solve problems in pen &amp; paper
 FakeGhost_dd05: Thanks for the information tho. I'm going to review all the syntax and do several problems. thank you
 FakeGhost_dd05: (this is a link they sent me)

 Majeck: FakeGhost_dd05
 Majeck: I'll DM you
 Majeck: Could someone link the plugin that lets you work in CG with multiple files?
 philb32: Majeck, did you get your code back? I finished episode 1, just looking at episode 2 now
 Majeck: Thanks for asking!
 Majeck: No I didn't but it was only like +-20 minutes of work lost so no biggie
 philb32: ok
 Majeck: I'm actually really excited
 philb32: about what?
 Majeck: I just finished a "semi" hardcoded solution for Mars Lander Ep. 3
 Majeck: Oh, and it worked!
 philb32: well done, don't know that one, maybe I'll have a look tomorrow.
 Majeck: I just need to implement two big classes (both of which I've already done similar ones in different games) and I'll be done&#160;:)
 philb32: go ror it!
 Majeck: It'll be the first very-hard puzzle I solve and it'll get me to level 20
 ZarthaxX: gz :O
 Majeck: philb32 Episode 1 and 2 of what game?

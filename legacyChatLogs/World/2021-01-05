 z64555: I must ask myself. Do I *really* want to do a BSP tree for actor awareness?
 z64555: maybe not actually build one, but the algorithm to home in on a target should work
 my_genjutsu: help
 my_genjutsu: i need help
 LeoCaprile: with what
 SPDene: my_genjutsu how many wires are they and what colour are they?
 LeoCaprile: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 z64555: bleh, gotta remind myself to adhere to the axiom of Occam's Razor
 Annihilannic: Anyone else having this issue with 'play my code' not refreshing the game window after a while?  full page refresh seems to resolve temporarily.
 z64555: Double check your internet connection, web apps like these don't like dropped packets.
 z64555: ping time is also a factor, then complexity (or integrity) of your program, and finally business of the server
 z64555: hecking. I just found myself in a traveling salesman problem. the salesman has a shotgun and the routes have time limits on them...
 thepepefrog: ok
 SnapisPro: i must be the only one that does a "easy" challenges in absurdly many lines of code :pensive:
 SnapisPro: challenge*
 Stilgart: by easy challenge, do you mean easy puzzle&#160;?
 Stilgart: if so, you can check the solution code of others
 Stilgart: (once solved)
 SnapisPro: that's how I figured that i have absurdly many lines of code
 One-coder-Z: I have been enough with my poor English.:confounded:
 SnapisPro: I agre with yuo brother
 Uljahn: i think the number of lines doesn't matter if your code stays readable and clear, in this regard straight solutions could be better than tricky ones
 GharbiWass: @One-coder-Z me too&#160;:(
 clemg: haslpha&#160;?
 Stilgart: Uljahn: the number of lines does matter at some point
 Uljahn: Stilgart: sure thing, especially when solution is over engineered
 Kokoz: Can someone help me start the Shadows of the Knight challange??
 Kitkat260: gm
 zhoubou: Kokoz do you know what binary search is?
 Kokoz: nope.. And I just realized it is too early for me to be here :S. Sorry for bothering
 zhoubou: That puzzle is not so hard.
 Plusk: hi
 Kokoz: Yea, well, I have some more learning to do before trying again.. I am a beginner and I tought that I will learn here, but it only checks my knoledge so far
 zhoubou: Yeah, this isn't a learning platform really. It can guide you to check out resources for learning though.
 zhoubou: I learned quite a lot since I started here.
 Kokoz: True. I will be back in a few weeks :D
 TheBarnacle: Good luck&#160;:)!
 zhoubou: Haha
 Kokoz: Thanks
 SwagColoredKitteh: hi, y'all qts
 jacek: ohai
 Astrobytes: wow, long time!
 jacek:&#160;?
 SwagColoredKitteh: oh hi! o:
 SwagColoredKitteh: i haven't been here in quite a while yeah
 Astrobytes: Understatement of the year so far :P
 SwagColoredKitteh: :D
 Astrobytes: All good with ya?
 SwagColoredKitteh: not great, but i'm surviving
 SwagColoredKitteh: covid ruined my whole social life so i went back to being a hermit pretty much ahah
 SwagColoredKitteh: what about you?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I can relate. Back in full lockdown again now. Meh, health issues, COVID... not been a great year tbh
 Astrobytes: But still here.
 SwagColoredKitteh: yeah health issues .. i've had a bunch of those and i haven't even had covid
 SwagColoredKitteh: hope i never will have it, but we'll see; i do my best
 Astrobytes: I had it early last year, not sure if that means I'm immune to the new strain. Try your best not to get it.
 SwagColoredKitteh: was coding a bit on the fall challenge 2020, pretty fun game
 Astrobytes: Wasn't keen on it tbh, lots of people did though. 
 SwagColoredKitteh: yeah, i'm one of the very careful people :P
 SwagColoredKitteh: but my parents are anti-vaxxers and pretty much denying the virus even exists
 SwagColoredKitteh: ugh
 Astrobytes: Trust me, everyone should be being the very careful kind of person these days.
 eulerscheZahl: oh dear
 Astrobytes: Oh god, antivaxxers
 SwagColoredKitteh: oh hey eulerscheZahl o/ been a while
 eulerscheZahl: my dad bought a book about 9/11 recently. now he thinks the author has good arguments for it being an inside-job
 eulerscheZahl: also: hi
 SwagColoredKitteh: with conspiracy theorists, it tends to be a slow dive into insanity and it starts with stuff like that
 SwagColoredKitteh: i also feel that filter bubbles make it *way* easier to fall into the conspiracy trap
 Astrobytes: I do find elements of it sketchy, but the conspiracy theories about it are bonkers.
 SwagColoredKitteh: and most people can't even correct for it as they don't know it happens
 Astrobytes: Very true.
 SwagColoredKitteh: so no matter how insane the idea, you can get surrounded by people who agree with it
 Astrobytes: Yep. And there are an awful lot of them around.
 SPDene: it's probably because the idea are implanted by all the nanobots we've been injected with :P 
 Astrobytes: By Bill Gates ofc.
 zhoubou: Bill Gates is just a puppet of the lizards.
 Astrobytes: Oh I forgot about them.
 zhoubou: :P
 eulerscheZahl: but lizards are controlled by chemtrails
 SwagColoredKitteh: anyone else excited to get microchipped?
 zhoubou: My brother and I
 SwagColoredKitteh: eulerscheZahl and the chemtrails are controlled by bill gates, making us come full circle
 Astrobytes: Where do the UFOs/aliens fit in here?
 eulerscheZahl: in the pyramids of gizeh
 Astrobytes: So German. Giza :P
 SwagColoredKitteh: and elon musk's secret plan is to reunite with his alien brethren
 eulerscheZahl: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 zhoubou: My brother believes we are ancestors of aliens, and they will be the next step in evolution
 ZarthaxX: swago :O
 SwagColoredKitteh: ZarthaxX hi o/
 ZarthaxX: hai
 SwagColoredKitteh: been a (long) while
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 ZarthaxX: valid englando
 SwagColoredKitteh: me confuse
 eulerscheZahl: an unsigned long while?
 SwagColoredKitteh: unfortunately it's signed
 SwagColoredKitteh: still no clue whose signature it is, though
 Astrobytes: Could be worse, it could be singed.
 SwagColoredKitteh: long long signed
 eulerscheZahl: you missed my datatype joke
 eulerscheZahl: oh you didn't
 Astrobytes: I responded with some wordplay.
 SwagColoredKitteh: i may be a very rusty programmer but i still know some C :P
 ZarthaxX: :rofl:
 SwagColoredKitteh: the rust puns are back
 eulerscheZahl: we have dbdr for rust now
 SwagColoredKitteh: cg has this whole skill tree whoa
 Astrobytes: also hi Zarthang 
 SwagColoredKitteh: dbdr?
 eulerscheZahl: you missed a lot
 SwagColoredKitteh: "reach the top 1000 players in clash of code"
 SwagColoredKitteh: no please
 SwagColoredKitteh: cg why .. why would you make me do that
 Astrobytes: And many, many new multis.
 SwagColoredKitteh: have mercy cg i don't want to play clash of code
 SwagColoredKitteh: yeah i saw, there are a lot
 Astrobytes: I haven't done the clash quest. I'd rather pull my own teeth out.
 SwagColoredKitteh: i have to approve or reject a contribution
 ZarthaxX: hey astrobytong
 SwagColoredKitteh: maybe some other time, i'll just play multis
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5774f141c59462b06e77d826d14d052d7966">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5774f141c59462b06e77d826d14d052d7966</a>take this :angel:
 Astrobytes: Wasn't it a multi or an optim before? Or am I just slow
 SwagColoredKitteh: is that 3d tetris
 eulerscheZahl: blockout? always a puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: and yes that's a good summary of it
 Astrobytes: Ah. Well, my mistake.
 SwagColoredKitteh: feels like you'd just end up doing a simulation for it :P
 SwagColoredKitteh: but then again when you're on cg everything looks like a tree search
 eulerscheZahl: and you are right again
 SwagColoredKitteh: petition to rename codingame.com to treesearch.club
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: you can try codinggame.com or codeingame.com
 ZarthaxX: lmao :rofl:
 DomiKo: lol
 SwagColoredKitteh: spring challenge 2020 looks fun too
 SwagColoredKitteh: feels like codingame ran out of names and just started calling thins {season} challenge {year}
 SwagColoredKitteh: *things
 eulerscheZahl: both spring and fall were nice but had their downsides
 eulerscheZahl: like fog
 eulerscheZahl: and they plan to have 2 contests per year&#160;:(
 SwagColoredKitteh: i found fog pretty fun in wondev woman, ended up doing cool stuff like probability maps for where the enemy might be
 SwagColoredKitteh: couldn't say for spring challenge 2020 as i haven't done that
 eulerscheZahl: you could only see the cells in your corridor
 jacek: fog in fall challenge?
 eulerscheZahl: so walking around the corner could possibly kill you
 SwagColoredKitteh: spring challenge
 eulerscheZahl: fall challenge had an unknown next order which can be seen as fog
 jacek: for both players
 eulerscheZahl: only 4 months till the spring challenge
 SwagColoredKitteh: unknown next order?
 SwagColoredKitteh: like you couldn't control the next thing they did sometimes?
 eulerscheZahl: you have 5 orders to choose from. complete 1 and another gets added so you have 5 again
 eulerscheZahl: you can't predict that added order
 SwagColoredKitteh: i guess this is unrelated to MOVE? i only have the wood2 description for the challenge
 Astrobytes: No, the Fall challenge. You're on the Spring one right?
 SwagColoredKitteh: i'm talking about the spring one
 SwagColoredKitteh: oh
 SwagColoredKitteh: i re-read, woops
 Astrobytes: :D
 SwagColoredKitteh: i did the fall one a bit and am at silver
 zhoubou: In Crytsal Rush, how do I know if my bot has completed an action, like "DIG X Y" if it isn't at position for digging currently and it automatically moves to it? I was thinking about using current position, but it can move to adjacent tiles as well.
 SwagColoredKitteh: i just have some bools saying if the order has been taken in my "sim"
 Astrobytes: I barely remember zhoubou, sorry. That was the radar + ore one right?
 zhoubou: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: Amadeus Unleash the Geek
 Astrobytes: Yup.
 zhoubou: I guess I will just move on my own then. Too bad the game doesn't have something to check your past action.
 Astrobytes: If I remember right, you have to keep track of a lot of stuff in that game yourself.
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that's one of those games
 eulerscheZahl: like codebusters and ocean of code
 zhoubou: Oh well. Thanks&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Btw how do you get that red text in chat?
 eulerscheZahl: say the name zhoubou
 eulerscheZahl: red for you
 eulerscheZahl: eulerscheZahl =&gt; red for me
 zhoubou: Oh, I see.
 zhoubou: Awesome, thanks.
 eulerscheZahl: note: you can't make yourself red unless you use 2 different tabs to chat
 zhoubou: CG chat is just weird, isn't it
 eulerscheZahl: it has some flaws
 xdcomrade: does someone have experience with queues in python? i wonder how can you make beam search with queues? i can surely copy all the items to list and work with lists, but i guess it won|t be that fast  
 eulerscheZahl: like no way to delete a message again
 zhoubou: Or no replies to specific message
 eulerscheZahl: that part is fine IMO
 zhoubou: Yeah, it might be an advanced feature
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see what's wrong with lists for beam search
 Astrobytes: Since you can tag people it's not so hard to reply specifically.
 eulerscheZahl: but you can try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html</a>
 zhoubou: I guess you're right Astrobytes :P
 SwagColoredKitteh: iirc there are XEPs that can address both of those
 eulerscheZahl: not being able to block users from private messages is another downside
 Astrobytes: indeed zhoubou&#160;:)
 SwagColoredKitteh: havent done xmpp dev in quite a while now&#160;:(
 SwagColoredKitteh: i have mixed feelings about @username or stuff like reply functionality for chat, because people constantly forget to use them
 zhoubou: One thing that could improve is clicking a name to reply instead of typing out a name. Or at least autocomplete.
 eulerscheZahl: eul[tab]
 eulerscheZahl: try it
 SwagColoredKitteh: there is autocomplete when you press tab
 Astrobytes: autocomplete with tab
 zhoubou: Ohh
 zhoubou: Wow
 zhoubou: Lol
 SwagColoredKitteh: ah right there is a deletion xep: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html">https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0424.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and of course Astrobytes lost the type race :D
 SwagColoredKitteh: :p
 Astrobytes: I came third! Even worse than usual
 SwagColoredKitteh: is Astrobytes typing slow a meme or something
 zhoubou: You've been Euler'd
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Only with regard to supplying some site information/advice though
 eulerscheZahl: it also happened on the RAIC discord :P
 Astrobytes: Hahaha, oh yeah. Forgot about that :D
 Uljahn: hey kitteh :purple_heart:
 SwagColoredKitteh: Uljahn! hi! :3
 SwagColoredKitteh: u qt
 xdcomrade: just wondering: I add a node to a queue and I have some kind of score of these node. how can i restrict the size of the queue, say to 400 nodes, if the sorting of the queue is not allowed? and if I work with a priority queue wouldn't the last node forever taken (as the score tends to be increased with every turn of the game?)
 eulerscheZahl: you clear the list/queue after each new depth
 eulerscheZahl: list of nodesexpand allsort, keep best and delete the restgo to 1
 eulerscheZahl: also make sure to eliminate duplicate nodes
 xdcomrade: and sorting happens in the list? isn't it a bit slow? to make a queue and then copy everything to a list?
 eulerscheZahl: either list+sort or queue that sorts itself
 eulerscheZahl: list is probably more efficient
 xdcomrade: cool, need to test it. thank you!
 DomiKo: Bit Runner is so hard&#160;:(
 DomiKo: Second day of debugging
 DomiKo: Its so funny when after several hours I make one little change and boom Perfect Submit
 darkhorse64: You wrote a GA&#160;? Yesterday I tweaked a little thing in Search Race for a large improvement
 DomiKo: yea
 DomiKo: I Wrote GA and I'm debuging sim...
 darkhorse64: You are ready for PCR, MM, CotC, CSB, FB
 DomiKo: I did FB that was painful
 darkhorse64: large sim
 DomiKo: but that beautiful animation
 DomiKo: they are so nice
 darkhorse64: one of my favorite
 DomiKo: I see &lt; 11K in SR nice
 struct: I have sim it has 2k lines, but never used it
 struct: also I have 100 bot line that made it to legend
 darkhorse64: tron&#160;?
 struct: in fb
 DomiKo: only 100?
 DomiKo: Lol
 struct: its bottom legend
 struct: but made it there
 DomiKo: but still
 darkhorse64: In SR, I know quite smooth trajectories. They were quite bumpy before
 DomiKo: Mean Max is another story
 darkhorse64: I now have
 DomiKo: Its really hard for me to do that games with heavy sims
 DomiKo: like the Poker
 darkhorse64: Pick the referees 
 struct: cache collisions
 DomiKo: I never did fast collisions
 DomiKo: and there are like 5 games that can use it
 DomiKo: Maybe I should one time
 darkhorse64: Moving from Java to C++ is not too hard. You will find that all these sim based multis have the same code architecture
 DomiKo: Yeah I know
 DomiKo: but sometimes they are sooo big
 struct: Also you can use avx on most of those games
 darkhorse64: Collision code in avx&#160;? Wow&#160;!
 DomiKo: I'm still waiting when Marchete will do Mars Lander with AVX
 DomiKo: when will do blog about it*
 struct: I did it for csb
 struct: but never finished smitsimax
 struct: so didnt submit
 DomiKo: I know some basics about AVX
 DomiKo: but using it in big game
 DomiKo: isn't straightforward 
 struct: I had some help from marchet
 struct: he shared with me his pcr avx code
 darkhorse64: Dealing with conditional code in AVX is tricky
 darkhorse64: I wish he shared it in Github
 DomiKo: marchet's blog about it is really good
 DomiKo: but still 
 DomiKo: Ohh yes
 DomiKo: Wood 3 boos
 DomiKo: beat me 10 to NULL&#160;:(
 struct: darkhorse  try pming him on discord
 struct: I would share it, but its not my code so
 eulerscheZahl: fun fact about bitrunner: each boss has a 100% winrate vs the previous one according to illedan
 jacek: overfitting?
 darkhorse64: I agree with you struct
 DomiKo: I could say that's true
 DomiKo: every version of my code have 100% winrate with one boss
 DomiKo: and 0 with another
 DomiKo: difference between leagues is so huge
 DomiKo: it's like playing new game
 eulerscheZahl: pb wrote some tough bosses by what i've heard
 struct: This is old code, and i didnt really  comment on it
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dca02945-bd80-4b1e-929f-537d2d82cc67">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/dca02945-bd80-4b1e-929f-537d2d82cc67</a>
 struct: Some people just do avx for the collisions
 struct: I did for all pods instead
 darkhorse64: It's for CSB&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Lucky1Devil: salam aleykum
 struct: v8ErrorColl = 1.5f
 struct: There are multiple ways to do it
 jacek: good evening
 struct: Now that i read my code, I would change some things
 struct: hi jace k
 darkhorse64: I see,every collision splits the [0,1] interval for all pods. That deals with part of the divergence. 
 struct: yeah, also when you apply the collisions you will need conditional checks
 struct: pods[c.a].vx = if_sub(collCheck, pods[c.a].vx, fx * m1c);pods[c.a].vy = if_sub(collCheck, pods[c.a].vy, fy * m1c);pods[c.b].vx = if_add(collCheck, pods[c.b].vx, fx * m2c);pods[c.b].vy = if_add(collCheck, pods[c.b].vy, fy * m2c);
 NuclearKitten_a446: heyo
 darkhorse64: How much do you gain from that code&#160;? 
 NuclearKitten_a446: easiest medium problem?
 HammerzZ: Conway Sequence
 struct: I have 1-1.5mill
 HammerzZ: -if u went to BBE
 struct: But this is without eval
 darkhorse64: compared to scalar code&#160;?
 struct: 300-400k for me
 struct: but some people can do more with scalar
 darkhorse64: I just can't remember how much I got
 struct: Also I think avxing only the collisions might be better
 darkhorse64: Yes, similar, I should revisit this code.
 darkhorse64: gtg
 struct: cya
 darkhorse64: thanks
 struct: np
 derp22: Hello, anyone around?
 derp22: I was just wondering how to display messages on my bots in CSB
 jacek: hello
 zhoubou: derp22 Just append your message to the end. "X Y THRUST MESSAGE"
 derp22: Thanks!
 zhoubou: Np&#160;:)
 zhoubou: Also, hi jacek :P What's up
 VizGhar: jacek say oO
 Kitkat260: hello
 pb4: DomiKo&#160;: you're playing BR&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you are making pb happy
 pb4: &lt;3
 pb4: :D
 DomiKo: pb4 yes &lt;3
 pb4: How do you like it&#160;?
 DomiKo: very much
 DomiKo: I love the bosses
 DomiKo: I spend one day in Wood 5
 DomiKo: then one day in Wood 4
 pb4: let's see how long you love them :smiling_imp:
 DomiKo: This is so funny
 DomiKo: when you go to next league with 100% winrate
 DomiKo: but then
 DomiKo: Boss just crash you
 DomiKo: and you realize that you don't know how to play this game
 VizGhar: What game?
 pb4: Bit Runner
 eulerscheZahl: 2048
 pb4: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/bit-runner-2048">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/bit-runner-2048</a>

 eulerscheZahl: i like how the middle part on the URL is useless :D
 VizGhar: you got me&#160;:( I clicked
 eulerscheZahl: take this link to an epic game as my excuse<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/850088a159bea424cb5e8f502cc34eabda16ff">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/850088a159bea424cb5e8f502cc34eabda16ff</a>
 VizGhar: spanish inquisition!!!
 jacek: do the rules change every league?
 eulerscheZahl: no, just stronger bosses
 jacek: phew
 pb4: I strongly dislike rule changes between leagues
 eulerscheZahl: jacek dislikes rules
 pb4: :D
 Astrobytes: I think most of CG are with you on that pb4
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 pb4: Well actual [CG] people haven't implemented the "skip wood leagues" button yet...
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine with wood for introduction if it's clear what changes to expect
 CallieB: pb4 if you don't like rule changes just wait until you find out about client scope creep :wink:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I can't see that button ever coming&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: i suggested a SKIP_WOOD command: makes you win vs other bots that don't use it, draw otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: so i would expect an easy promotion
 pb4: I like that
 eulerscheZahl: I was turned down on that idea
 pb4: Can be integrated in the referee, doesn't require work from CG
 jacek: you got additional chromosome?
 Stilgart: is skipping wood really that important&#160;?
 jacek: its more about rules
 Astrobytes: Yeah, no rule changes = no skip needed.
 Stilgart: I think this is another issue 
 eulerscheZahl: if (:pray:) my contest suggestion should get approved, i'll at least link the contribution with final rules at the top of the statement
 Stilgart: CG could give a link to the final rules at the beginning of the contest
 Astrobytes: Beats having to wait for struc t to do it for us&#160;:)
 Stilgart: (and should)
 eulerscheZahl: how is struct involved into that?
 Astrobytes: He usually does a screenshot or mock up of the rules from the github
 pb4: eulerscheZahl&#160;: that's a great idea too
 eulerscheZahl: i remember downloading and reuploading the referee 2 or 3 times. that's faster that screenshots :P
 pb4: I usually get out of wood leagues with a code close to my legend code
 pb4: Can't be bothered to write something else that'll be discarded...
 eulerscheZahl: i keep my data structures as well
 Stilgart: pb4: does that mean that you get the correct approach when writing your first code&#160;???
 pb4: There's survivor bias here
 pb4: if I don't get a good first or second code, I lose motivation
 pb4: so...
 Stilgart: I see
 Stilgart: but it's still impressive
 pb4: But on the subset of games where I did well, yes the first approach is generally pretty good, often shoots to within top 10
 Kitkat260: hello
 Kitkat260: coders
 Stilgart: pb4: when I read this, I can't help thinking that I am missing something
 eulerscheZahl: for me the data structure is mostly consistent over the contest. the bot logic is subject to change
 Stilgart: same (and you may add "a lot" at the end)
 eulerscheZahl: usually some monte carlo to start with. then it can turn into BFS, beam search or remain random
 Stilgart: imho, an option to prevent PM is more important than skipping wood leagues
 eulerscheZahl: PM?
 Stilgart: private messages
 Stilgart: they remains for decades, seriously&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: users annoying you?
 Stilgart: not really
 Stilgart: UX is annoying me
 Stilgart: I can hardly see 4 tabs in this interface
 Stilgart: #world + #fr + 2 privates
 Stilgart: I currently have 5 privates (which is quite low)
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's incredibly annoying.
 eulerscheZahl: i know that struggle when spying on other channels
 eulerscheZahl: and the last you entered always opens first on a new tab
 Stilgart: then, I am annoyed by beginners asking in PM instead of #fr
 eulerscheZahl: that's another story *sigh*
 Stilgart: not there fault if the user interface is annoying, though
 Astrobytes: *Especially* during contests...
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not sure why they chose me yet
 Stilgart: but I would be happy if such PM tab disappeared within a couple of hours
 eulerscheZahl: and these PM start with a "hi"
 Stilgart: toads are nice&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: then 30s of typing so you tab away again
 Astrobytes: Or there was at least options available to customise
 eulerscheZahl: then "can I ask you a question"
 Stilgart: beware of the PM starting with "hey" :D
 eulerscheZahl: or sometimes "BRO I HAVE QUESTION"
 zhoubou: Wouldn't it be better to have an option where you would set that only people you follow can PM you?
 Stilgart: nope
 Stilgart: millions of unknown users are following me
 Stilgart: and I can't imagine how many more follow people in the top10
 zhoubou: I mean the other way around
 Stilgart: would be a pain too
 eulerscheZahl: that's how it works if the user you want to contact is offline
 Stilgart: sometimes, I do want to PM with somebody I do not follow
 eulerscheZahl: but there's always the option to send a private message on the forum
 lopidav: hey, eulerscheZahl, when <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/revenge-in-rejecting-contributions-and-deleted-comments/188613">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/revenge-in-rejecting-contributions-and-deleted-comments/188613</a> is gonna be unlocked?
 eulerscheZahl: dunno, maybe it's permanent in the end. it has been dealt with
 Stilgart: lopidav: believe me, it is not a good idea
 Westicles: probably should be deleted at this point
 Stilgart: like your account
 lopidav: how was it resolved? I'm interested in the whole story
 eulerscheZahl: shush, thin ice
 Astrobytes: Yeah, come on.
 lopidav: boy, that's some toxicity
 Stilgart: it is not resolved
 eulerscheZahl: self-upvotes will be removed retro-actively
 eulerscheZahl: that's all I have to say about this topic
 Westicles: oh good.  I was a little surprised when you unclick them it doesn't do anything
 pb4: You got insider info eulerscheZahl&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: there's a moderators channel on discord
 lopidav: self-upvote was a problem here? I thought that moderation rights abuse, toxicity, and fights were in the core of that 
 lopidav: doesn't look like anything at all was caused by self-upvoting
 Stilgart: making noise is my way to wake up CG
 Westicles: I am proud I was finally able to get this issue addressed properly.  
 lopidav: Was it addressed?
 Westicles: I meant the upvotes...
 lopidav: oh, self-upvoting?
 lopidav: but that's so insignificant 
 lopidav: I feel like I don't understand the situation at all
 Astrobytes: Let's just say the upvoting was close to the core of the whole issue.
 Westicles: watching the xp leaderboard on rollback day will be :popcorn:
 lopidav: ooooh, you can farm xp by commenting and self-upvoting?
 VizGhar: why tf would you do that? o.O

 Feeg4ever: and also red hacker
 Feeg4ever: you guys are getting sleepy.
 RShields: hacking is almost always, make a phone call to someone stupid, say you're IT, and ask for their username and password
 Feeg4ever: Haha
 Feeg4ever: hacking the satellite. start the laser beam... then booom
 Andriamanitra: very true, humans are almost always the weakest link in any security system
 Feeg4ever: what an AI will code for us?
 Feeg4ever: make it secure.
 Feeg4ever: is that possible?
 RShields: who will write the ai
 Feeg4ever: the humans!
 Feeg4ever: oh i get it
 Feeg4ever: okey...
 Feeg4ever: neverming
 Feeg4ever: nevermind
 Oregane: maybe they'll do something like caml, get a bunch of mathematicians to check the thing is secure and when you add anything, make it auto check itself
 rajington: js is all about the ecosystem and not a standard library, should at least have access to lodash/underscore
 rajington: for the length ones, use `var` or `let` instead of `const`, much shorter
 rajington: and drop unnecessary spaces
 rajington: or variable allocation
 poopooooo: ok
 poopooooo: why is it telling me 'Found: Nothing'
 poopooooo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://puu.sh/GboKq/24200b49a2.png">https://puu.sh/GboKq/24200b49a2.png</a>
 poopooooo: :L
 rajington: all your lines start with a space
 poopooooo: really?
 rajington: yeah, you add space before vs after, i bet after it would work (even though your output has an extra space at the end)
 remi6: Hello!
 poopooooo: but that's impossible
 poopooooo: I join the elements of a list with the space delimiter
 poopooooo: then add new line char
 rajington: oh nm misread, not sure
 poopooooo: yeah, I think I got trolled by the IDE
 remi6: This is weird.
 remi6: There is an extra newline in the end. Could this be a problem?
 TheMightyBrocolli_2e91: this is so facking hard
 TheMightyBrocolli_2e91: why is this so hard
 JBM: because you facking suck
 TheMightyBrocolli_2e91: damn
 TheMightyBrocolli_2e91: im only 13 okry?
 JBM: good news: that's fixable
 JBM: if you say so
 FLQ4: don't be a bully lol
 JBM: "he started it"
 scareware047: is there a way to use a config file for all preprocessor directives?
 JBM: as long as it's already on the CG servers
 Alshock: @TheMightyBrocolli_2e91 you can talk about it on this chat if you feel stuck ^^
 jrke: this weekly puzzle is easy
 SPDene: it was for me: it's an old puzzle I solved last week, so I just resubmitted&#160;:)
 hphadi: hi
 hphadi: :underage:hi
 jrke: SPDene i did the same "RESUBMIT"
 jrke: now my last quest of last path is left
 scareware047: I meant outside of CG
 scareware047: in general
 scareware047: like I have 2 files with different #define blahblah
 scareware047: and I want to load both but if they overwrite a value then throw an error
 MSmits: there is no outside
 JayBeAl: hey, is there a way to use an own IDE and/or additional files?
 MSmits: you can use your own IDE
 JayBeAl: and how to get the inputs?
 MSmits: but everything has to appear in the CG IDE eventually
 MSmits: in 1 file
 MSmits: there's some tools for working in multiple files and automatically combine them
 JayBeAl: oof
 MSmits: i dont use them, so dont ask me how to find them
 JayBeAl: damn, okay thanks anyways
 MSmits: I find that working with bots sizes of 1k lines is ok
 MSmits: dont need multiple files for that
 MSmits: 2k bots become a bad experience to code, i admit
 MSmits: VS helps a lot, i just collapse functions so they're easily scrolled past
 JayBeAl: Well im used to keep my files clean and short, it is hurtin me just using one file :D
 MSmits: you'll get used to it&#160;:)
 JayBeAl: Funny thing is, keeping all in one file is against clean code in every way xD
 MSmits: depends on how much *all* is
 MSmits: many players here can code bots in 300-400 lines
 JayBeAl: Still too lang files for my tastes :D
 JayBeAl: long*
 MSmits: but that's a matter of style/taste
 JayBeAl: right
 MSmits: there is no reason not to work in files that long
 MSmits: there's also disadvantages to working in multiple files
 MSmits: I tend to lose track of what is where
 JayBeAl: Im used to it, i can hold the track easily. Im working at a very large project at my company where it is common to use short und many files
 MSmits: 1 file becomes untenable when you cant quickly scroll back and forth between stuff you're coding. Starts to happen near 1k I find
 MSmits: yes, but that is a different kind of projecrt
 MSmits: of course you have to do it then
 MSmits: there are more differences like that
 JayBeAl: sure sure
 MSmits: for example, noone cares about writing get and set functions
 MSmits: or access modifiers
 JayBeAl: oof
 JayBeAl: xD
 MSmits: it's just quicker
 MSmits: less typing
 MSmits: less problem with working in 1 file&#160;:)
 JayBeAl: but less expandable without partly rewriting
 MSmits: but you dont really need to expand
 MSmits: you need to experiment mostly
 Nixerrr: Common OOP good practices often don't apply on CG
 MSmits: try different approaches
 MSmits: usually that means different files for different bots
 MSmits: but each file is self-contained
 MSmits: at least thats how i do it
 jrke: i have one doubt in pacman suppose there are 2 ways for same pellet with same distance then which way will our pac follow.
 MSmits: but hey, you can work however you want it, provided you use a tool that puts everything in 1 file, others do it
 MSmits: you're not alone
 tomatoes: maybe there are ready to use "bundler" on forum, search
 MSmits: there are
 MSmits:  not sure which languages
 Nixerrr: I know there are ones for Java and C++
 MSmits: jrke probably the first one the pathing algo finds&#160;:)
 MSmits: basically, dont use the autopather, write your own pathfinder
 JayBeAl: sure
 JayBeAl: Thanks to all for the input!
 MSmits: np
 MSmits: btw, i am not a professional coder, so take what i say with a grain of salt here. CG is most of what I know
 jrke: MSmits means first finded by refree pathfinder
 MSmits: yes jrke
 jrke: thanks
 jrke: will look at refree
 jrke: where can i find refree link
 jrke: in bugs and question
 MSmits: should be in the statement&#160;?&gt;
 MSmits: sometimes it's not in the wood versions, not sure how it is for pacman
 jrke: ah found
 jrke: i m failing to make gold&#160;:(
 DomiKo: jkre in pacman
 DomiKo: there is code in java
 DomiKo: using java queue
 DomiKo: and there is only comparator for distance
 DomiKo: so i guess if there are two paths with same distance
 DomiKo: then random is chossen
 jrke: hmm
 Xcalibre: just output the second cell of the path u want to take
 DomiKo: i had the same problem back then
 Xcalibre: or first if u're bumping into a wall
 DomiKo: so your own pathfinding should make stuff much easier
 hphadi: hi

 _Sophia_: Hello
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: I believe I am talking 
 JayBeAl: i cant see the video of crystal rush on my firefox browser on linux pc. What did i do wrong? Though i can see puzzles like batman
 _Sophia_: ok
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Hmmmm I just checked crystal rush and it looked like something changed. I'm still using my contest code, but it looks like there are some new inputs...
 JayBeAl: my code is running, im getting valid outputs, i just cant see the video
 cmd.exe: bezdım dünyalarımi
 JayBeAl: i can see any other video, lol
 JayBeAl: just not the one of crystal rush. And i dont have any errors
 EEEEEEEEEEEEE: Try refreshing?
 JayBeAl: i did, i also deleted cookies and cleared cache
 [CG]Thibaud: any extension messing with it?
 Astrobytes: Sometimes fully closing and reopening the browser works, or open in a fresh tab
 [CG]Thibaud: I guess you're not seeing it either on the game page main page and not just in the IDE
 JayBeAl: @Thibaud yes. But it is only crystal rush, i can see any other puzzle's/challenges videos's
 JayBeAl: @astro i already did several times
 [CG]Thibaud: tried with another browser&#160;?
 JayBeAl: not yet, is next step ill try
 JayBeAl: sadly i have to update my archlinux first and this will take its time since i didnt use this notebook for months xD
 remi6: Here is a little thing that collects Clash of Code links from Twitch chats #Clash
 JayBeAl: Updated linux, restartet notebook, crystal rush is now working again.
 eulerscheZahl: great
 eulerscheZahl: oh, I got promoted :o
 Astrobytes: grats!
 eulerscheZahl: you too
 Astrobytes: So I see
 eulerscheZahl: and the list of online users is much longer now
 eulerscheZahl: who is Automaton2020?
 Astrobytes: Ah yes. I have no idea
 jacek: and urge for trolling has just increased
 Astrobytes: lol
 Scarfield: i thought you didnt want to be mods euler and ModstroBytes
 eulerscheZahl: my days as a troll are counted&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Who said that Scarferator?
 eulerscheZahl: i have to create a new account, now that I deleted my alts
 Astrobytes: You can mildly troll, pleasantly
 Scarfield: 1.463 days, and counting(?)
 eulerscheZahl: is that a decimal point or a thousands separator?
 Scarfield: i thought you both said you didnt want to, or at least werent sure
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: i never said anything like that when I got asked
 Astrobytes: No, just jacek because he wanted to concentrate on his trolling
 eulerscheZahl: and Uljahn wasn't sure about it
 eulerscheZahl: and struct just left us&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Still nothing from him?
 eulerscheZahl: last sign of life i got from him was a :thumbsup: on the 15th
 Astrobytes: Hm. He does have a habit of going AWOL from time to time
 eulerscheZahl: no idea what AWOL means but yes, he occasionally vanishes
 Astrobytes: Absent WithOut Leave
 eulerscheZahl: i hope i didn't cause burnout for him
 Astrobytes: Military term originally
 Scarfield: AFKWOL
 Illedan: Hi
 Astrobytes: Well, he could just have said euler
 eulerscheZahl: hi moderator Illedan
 Illedan: Oh, chat moderator now \o/
 Astrobytes: Hey Illedan
 Scarfield: gonna be nice with some more mods though&#160;:) 
 Illedan: how do I do this moderator thingy? :P
 eulerscheZahl: with /kick Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: try it
 Illedan: AH
 jacek: alt+f4
 eulerscheZahl: can you kick yourself?
 Illedan: nope
 Illedan: :P
 eulerscheZahl: can I kick you?
 Illedan: sure
 Scarfield: maybe if you are a mod?
 eulerscheZahl: if not, i'll get a plane ticket and try in person
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: Please come
 Illedan: I'm moving tomorrow
 Illedan: need help
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: far away or just in town?
 Astrobytes: Ah good luck with the move
 Illedan: Only 15 km
 Illedan: My apartment is all boxes -.-
 eulerscheZahl: so not a life-changing event
 Illedan: Bigger house though
 Scarfield: nice
 Illedan: not an apartment anymore \o/
 Illedan: Bigger Office :dance:
 Illedan: And garden
 eulerscheZahl: any plans for kids?
 Scarfield: or dogs, or being mod?
 eulerscheZahl: or hobbies that need an extra room
 Illedan: Kids eventually
 Illedan: For now, just bigger space and a more permanent place
 Scarfield: imagine how many extra monitors you can fit now
 Astrobytes: cats &gt; kids. Wayyy cheaper too :P
 Illedan: gf really wants a cat
 Illedan: but I want to fix the house first :P
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's a good idea
 eulerscheZahl: so you are not next to a busy road i suppose
 Illedan: Nope
 Illedan: Now we are
 eulerscheZahl: great conditions to adopt a cat
 Scarfield: sounds like a great upgrate
 Illedan: The noice and dust :scream: 
 Astrobytes: That will make a pleasant change
 Illedan: I have friends alergic to cats
 Illedan: so we would have to get a allergy friendly cat 
 eulerscheZahl: then you meet them outside in your garden
 Astrobytes: Get new friends!
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Illedan: haha
 Illedan: :D
 <b>**eulerscheZahl warns Astrobytes for trolling :P</b>
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Illedan: Did you try to kick me?
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 Astrobytes: nope
 Illedan: Try
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan has been kicked by eulerscheZahl.
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: is that visible to everyone?
 Illedan: I saw it
 Scarfield: ye
 Astrobytes: yep
 Illedan: Nice :D
 Illedan: Is there a list of possible commands?
 eulerscheZahl: did not stop you for long :D
 eulerscheZahl:  /kick
 eulerscheZahl: and some external clients seem to support unban
 Scarfield:  /exploit
 Astrobytes:  /troll
 eulerscheZahl: gajim that is
 jacek:  /rm -rf *
 Illedan: How long does a ban last?
 eulerscheZahl: until the server is restarted
 eulerscheZahl: so for weeks possibly
 Illedan: Ok, don't ban me then
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: don't worry
 eulerscheZahl: also: kick/ban only apply for the current channel
 Astrobytes: Oh ban is also channel exclusive
 Illedan: ah, nice
 Illedan: #jointobebanned
 eulerscheZahl: recurse banned me on a testchannel once
 Astrobytes: Oh yeah, forgot about that
 Illedan: :D
 Scarfield: can you actually ban/kick/silence someone without being a mod? there was this kid last week trolling and started PM some of us
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl has been banned by Illedan.
 eulerscheZahl: he did it
 eulerscheZahl: and i won't see if you continue writing on that channel
 Illedan: Perfect
 Illedan: Now I can spam all the secrets
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: afaik you can't even kick or ban in private messages. not even when you are a mod
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 Illedan: That is the important stuff
 Scarfield: sadness, he got bored from being ignored quick enough though
 eulerscheZahl: and banning occasionally has the effect of getting spammed via private message
 Astrobytes: Yeah, many PMs will be incoming (screencapture at the ready for the good ones)
 Illedan: oh, dbdr first in SR again \o/
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Scarfield: oh and also a mod
 Scarfield: coincidence :thinking:
 Astrobytes: More mods than you can shake a banhammer at!
 eulerscheZahl: are you getting scared Scarfield?
 Astrobytes: Scarefield
 Scarfield: yea, just realised there are more mods here than not 
 Scarfield: :hugging:
 eulerscheZahl: you weren't here when Thibaud asked for volunteers I suppose
 Scarfield: the responsibility would be too much 
 Scarfield: and that emblem of power does not match my name :p
 dbdr: from now on, think twice before beaten my scores&#160;;)
 Scarfield: lol xD
 Astrobytes: lol
 aCat: oh - some easy PotW&#160;;-)
 aCat: right in time ^^'
 dbdr: less easy since I fixed the validators
 dbdr: but yes, still pretty easy
 Illedan: PotW?
 Astrobytes: puzzle of the week
 Scarfield: prisoner of the wizard
 Illedan: Oh, nice
 Illedan: Time to solve :D
 eulerscheZahl: what was wrong with them?
 eulerscheZahl: the validators i maen
 Scarfield: not checking if sub grids were "solved" correctly i suppose
 Scarfield: at least saw a solution that didnt check for that
 aCat: Is there a list of tags already used by the puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i could extract it, as i downloaded all puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: but meh
 aCat: Im just putting first letters
 aCat: and autocomplete gives what it has&#160;;-)
 eulerscheZahl: are you sure?
 aCat: good eanough- it puts some tags with '0 puzzle' even
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/%F0%9F%92%A6%F0%9F%92%A6%F0%9F%92%A6%F0%9F%94%A5%F0%9F%94%A5%F0%9F%94%A5">https://www.codingame.com/learn/%F0%9F%92%A6%F0%9F%92%A6%F0%9F%92%A6%F0%9F%94%A5%F0%9F%94%A5%F0%9F%94%A5</a>
 Scarfield: am considering to start FB, these are some potentially fast wizards
 Scarfield: -106 &lt; vx &lt; 106-106 &lt; vy &lt; 106
 Scarfield: 10^6 *
 eulerscheZahl: i bet you didn't find the above tag
 aCat: My contribution is not SO weirf
 aCat: *weird
 eulerscheZahl: your spelling is weirf
 aCat: i know ;p
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: it was sufficient to test if all sums were 45
 eulerscheZahl: oh :D
 Astrobytes: lol, bit of an oversight that one
 dbdr: found out by looking at other rust solutions
 eulerscheZahl: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
 dbdr: looks correct&#160;;)
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 dbdr: in average
 eulerscheZahl: don't we have an approval process for that?
 Scarfield: there is even a test case called "summing is not enough" 
 eulerscheZahl: let me guess: dbdr's testcase
 dbdr: what a coincidence
 Scarfield: ooh
 Scarfield: facepalm
 Scarfield: facefist even
 dbdr: easy now
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: Scarredface
 Scarfield: only BruisedFace, no need to worry
 Astrobytes: Ah good :D
 Illedan: Quest done :tada:
 Astrobytes: I only have clashes left&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: And I hate clashing
 Scarfield: its only xp anyway
 Illedan: Level 42 :tada:
 Illedan: Only optimization again
 Illedan: Code of the Rings -.-
 Astrobytes: I spent all my spare time at the weekend doing optim and golf. Totally traumatised.
 Illedan: Wanna talk about it?
 Astrobytes: No. PTSD :P
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: Illedan, I kinda want to stay at lvl 42 now&#160;:)
 Illedan: 42 ftw
 dbdr: 40, 41, 42, 42a, 42b, ...
 Illedan: Create a script to replace all &gt; 42 :D
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: ..42a1, 42a2...
 Astrobytes: Every additional level is a meta-42 level
 eulerscheZahl: like the latex versioning system
 Astrobytes: So Atari Go has 17 hours left for approval, anyone got bots in there that can approve? AFAIK the only issue was the viewer (the huge memory usage) and that's been fixed
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: don't ask me
 Astrobytes: lol Stilgart :D
 Stilgart: did I refuse ths one&#160;?
 Stilgart: (I wanted too quite badly)
 Astrobytes: Nah, that was Othello
 Astrobytes: Do feel free
 eulerscheZahl: i'd like to see it approved. but i won't without writing a bot myself
 Scarfield: you refused othello :o
 eulerscheZahl: he did
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: there was a contibution that asked to simulate a game of go
 eulerscheZahl: :tomato:
 Scarfield: sacriledge
 Astrobytes: It was a reasonable rejection Scarfield
 Astrobytes: That was a puzzle I think Stilgart
 Scarfield: heathen :p
 Stilgart: for multiplayer, i do not know what to think about
 Stilgart: Astrobytes: yep, a puzzle I did refuse
 Scarfield: oh, then i am not offended anymore :p
 Stilgart: anyway, it's an existing game I play sometimes, so I also want to refuse the multiplayer version
 Stilgart: but since it might be intersting, I won't vote
 Astrobytes: It has varying board sizes
 Stilgart: still breaking the magic imho
 Scarfield: but why refuse it though? serious question btw&#160;:)
 Stilgart: I just don't want to code a bot for a game I actually play (personal opinion, nothing more)
 Scarfield: isnt it a little much to refuse it then, i mean you dont have to code a bot for it?
 Astrobytes: That's why he's not voting Scarfield
 Scarfield: oh, im extra slow today lol
 Astrobytes: It was that facepunch
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: even just had a coffee, never drink coffee this late
 Astrobytes: I gave up drinking coffee past 2pm-ish tbh
 Astrobytes: Depending on workload
 Scarfield: yea me as well, but forgot to drink it ealier, and really wanted one cup.. RIP sleep 
 Astrobytes: Drink rum. Should counteract it.
 Stilgart: hum... coffee has no effet on my sleep&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: High tolerance.
 Stilgart: rum might have some
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 JBM: rum
 Scarfield: im more of a whiskey guy
 Astrobytes: JBM smelled the text from afar and appeared
 Stilgart: time to go back on #fr to drink beers
 Stilgart: :D
 Astrobytes: :beers:
 eulerscheZahl: play vindinium if you like beer :P
 Astrobytes: Bourbon or Irish Scarfield?
 Scarfield: irish single malt prefferably, but im not picky :p
 Astrobytes: Yeah the Irish make fine whiskey. Whisky-wise I love a Talisker single malt
 Scarfield: mmmm
 Astrobytes: Nice and smoky
 Scarfield: lafroic and lagavullin are great as well, probably slaughtered the spelling
 Astrobytes: Laphroaig and Lagavulin
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: nice try...
 Stilgart: but bender 4 first, and space maze even before
 eulerscheZahl: bender features beer too
 Astrobytes: Hmm, yeah, Forgot about Bender 4. Still need to do my Number Shifting solver too and quit playing it by hand
 eulerscheZahl: and Illedan needs to finish the app
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: I do
 Astrobytes: Put that in with chess then?
 Illedan: I just have to do this moving
 Illedan: pff
 Illedan: :D
 Illedan: Just do chess if you like
 eulerscheZahl: how shall we get rich if you don't build the app?
 Illedan: true true
 Illedan: I need to pay for the house
 Illedan: what was I thinking
 Illedan: Off to the app
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: I finished Snake this weekend for a friend :D
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8462468ed0113b37c6abb9f1a25ad764b388cc">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/8462468ed0113b37c6abb9f1a25ad764b388cc</a>
 Illedan: (he is going to use it for some work stuff :P )
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: no beer in space maze, which is probably why my code does timeouts&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Ah nice. You should have combined BEKK and Snake and called it snek
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Only Vodka in space Stilgart. Beer is too heavy to lift enough
 JBM: vodka
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: Wray &amp; Nephew. You can power your ship with the stuff.
 eulerscheZahl: let's say the car brand is a volvka
 Stilgart: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Hacking at RobberCity, damn thing is almost a 1 liner
 Stilgart: wait... why is this a medium puzzle?
 Astrobytes: Maybe was chucked in when they combined the CG and community puzzles
 Stilgart: nope, DPamar came after the merge (and I can see the difficulty set in the contribution)
 Astrobytes: Ah alright then
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nicola said same thing in forum
 Stilgart: I think it ended up in medium because the statement is so long to read
 PatrickMcGinnisII: It doesn't really affect anything
 Illedan: :zzz: cya
 Astrobytes: gn
 AntiSquid: isn't snake like some kinda TRON&#160;?
 Insufficient: ok so I have a question re: the surface puzzle, any of you know it well?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/surface">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/surface</a> this?
 Insufficient: (i dont want to outright ask it because i might give away spoilers)
 Insufficient: yeah that one
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i did it, wassup?
 AntiSquid: ok then don't ask lol 
 Insufficient: no dont worry
 Insufficient: i will pm you
 Insufficient: to avoid spoiling for others
 AntiSquid: lol most don't read chat anyway
 jacek: :thinking:
 AntiSquid: so many puzzles out there ...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, not gonna give it away im sure
 LuaCultist: e
 SandmanSW96: is there a page that lists all the previous puzzles of the week?
 Astrobytes: Nope, just the puzzles page
 PatrickMcGinnisII: just hit notifications and scroll down
 SandmanSW96: yeah that's a long way to scroll when you missed like 4 months
 SandmanSW96: and had to start a new account lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of puzzles have been promoted as puzzle of the week many times I'm sure
 SandmanSW96: all good
 Astrobytes: Yeah, best just to work through them from the main pages
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Insufficient 's question?  kinda went no where...so I'll make up my own question...can u solve it in under 70 lines of code...answer: yes
 Astrobytes: That the fill one with the islands?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yea, actually pretty easy
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it was an easy one. Maybe not for everyone I guess
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Insufficient you have to realize that some languages may not be fast enought o handle 10kx10k boards
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or even their input
 AntiSquid: he is looking for shortcut algos that cut computing time
 AntiSquid: best thing is to google ...
 AntiSquid: or try to make up an algo&#160;!!
 Insufficient: that's not what i was looking for but maybe i've just been really unclear in my pm's - sorry to bother you
 Insufficient: i appreciate all your help both Patrick and AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: that's what i understood though, thought you want some tricks to make it fast enough to work in python
 Insufficient: no, i already have it working
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there are a couple of ways to optimize so no timeout occurs.  I mostly do php and test case 9 completes just fine.  in the case of 2 bodies of water in a 10kx10k board...it's fairly easy to floodfill use a stack and a visited board to answer the questions without repeating the process
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i don't think i gave it away, but you only have to floodfill once
 AntiSquid: honestly how many puzzle solvers read the chat?
 Insufficient: if there are less than or equal to 2 bodies of water yes
 Insufficient: but could easily be 3 or more in a 1000x1000 
 Insufficient: would be cool if there were a very hard alternate which gave those cases maybe, just an idea though
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Insufficient I don't know what the string input limitations are, but I'm sure the memory limitations are the real constraints on large lakes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eg. case 9 is like 360k right from the start
 PatrickMcGinnisII: multiple by 3 (inputmap,visited map, lake id map) = 1M...so i'm pretty sure the test cases had to be limited.  Am I wrong?
 Insufficient: no that was also my suspicion, that this problem might legitimately be extremely difficult with a broader set of test cases 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well if we had to bytepack and bitboard it wouold just be a pain in the butt for a puzzle
 AntiSquid: not sure but i think at your level you could at least create your own version of the puzzle and test it with whatever custom cases you want Insufficient
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm currentl having issues with the Equalizing Arrays puzzle...I have found better solutions than the "correct" answers
 PatrickMcGinnisII: So i don't think the given solution code (when you get to a high enough level you can view the contribution)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is actually correct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and those that have solved it have used the solution code as a guide and have fallen in the same "trap"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's no forum on the puzzle
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yet, at least
 RoboStac: I've solved it without looking at the submitted solution, but can't guarantee I didn't fall into a trap
 AntiSquid: ah forgot the old style puzzle don't require you to upload anything ... so one could just attempt it offline, measure the time it takes and then optimize 
 Insufficient: hmm so if anybody cares, reading the discussion for surface, non-recursive BFS might be faster/better than recursive floodfill for this problem, and if not, then it might be just a language issue
 PatrickMcGinnisII: robo, tx...I'm glad people did it and found the same results as the contributor...I could be wrong, but test case 5 i get 45 operations instead of  49.  And I don't have the time to pick it all apart
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Insufficient you really don't even have to floodfill, just iterate thru the map once setting up some other variables along the way, if that helps.
 AntiSquid: always avoid recursion if you can 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: If I have to flood, i just use two stacks , what is it ...dijkstra?  I dunno, my mind is garbage right now
 Allis: @AntiSquid I'm not sure that's sound advice?
 AntiSquid: are you using some functional language? was referring to speed, not readability :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: recursive is only faster if you can exponentially reduce the function calls, otherwise it can only equal an iterative algorithm in speed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like find the GCM or LCM of a set, then recursive is elegant and faster
 PatrickMcGinnisII: very few, even tree traversals...ok I give up.  AntiSquid you are right 99.9% of the time
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: i hope so
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN how can we make recursion faster than iteration?!
 AutomatonNN: what are you playing there?
 AntiSquid: even AutomatonNN thinks it's daft
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a code between the leaderboard and only replace with me and play
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ooooh NN is still pinging eulerscheZahl
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol
 AntiSquid: even asks him to play
 PatrickMcGinnisII: beware of frog tongue
 Astrobytes: Slightly less frequently than previously but yes
 Scarfield: he can ban the automatons now though, and people inviting him to CoC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my brain is shot, I did my puzzle for the day
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol Scarfield
 AntiSquid: oh lots of new mods i see
 AntiSquid: was spamming that intense recently?
 Astrobytes: Aye
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I don't want to be a mod, i want to cuss indisciminantly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i typed out loud
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN should we make alts and troll to see how long they survive?
 Astrobytes: ban for spelling error
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can't even type
 PatrickMcGinnisII: smh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, we had that idea earlier AntiSquid
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yall be good, if u can't be good be good at it.  need food, brain mush
 Astrobytes: later Patrick, take care
 AntiSquid: i see, so dirty mods making alts around here eh?
 Astrobytes: Nah, just floated the idea. For trolls we have jacek to keep us occupied
 AntiSquid: AutomatonNN what's going on with this neighbourhood 
 AutomatonNN: why not be a bot&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Why not indeed AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: marchete that doesn't work as well
 AntiSquid: ah perfect solution 
 Scarfield: lol
 Astrobytes: Wow. Good ping
 Allis: Wait, are we not all bots?
 AntiSquid: we can all identify as bots
 AntiSquid: bots to the system, scripted in school
 Allis: Or, well, just a buncha hydrogen with way too much time on its hands.
 AntiSquid: im carbon based
 Allis: Hydrogen begat carbon.
 Allis: But this was a very long time ago.
 Scarfield: 60ish% water though, so that will mean 120% hydrogen obviously
 Allis: 60% of the time, it works 120% of the time.
 Insufficient: Can we send links in chat?
 Astrobytes: sure

 Insufficient: i thought this was really cool
 Astrobytes: Insufficient:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">https://github.com/mame/quine-relay</a>
 Insufficient: hahaha thats awesome
 Allis: Endoh-san is brilliant.
 Astrobytes: Alright, I'm out for tonight, gn people
 AkarshNeeraj: In clashofcode, after submitting, can I edit my code?
 Scarfield: gn
 AkarshNeeraj: I saw people increasing their score from 80% to 100%
 AkarshNeeraj: how did they do that?
 AkarshNeeraj: Can anyone please let me know?
 Allis: I've never seen that happen.
 Allis: The interface certainly doesn't give you the option to edit your submission, but if that's actually happening, they're probably abusing some undocumented API.
 AkarshNeeraj: Oh! Okay
 Allis: That is, replaying the request with a different program, but I feel like CG would have checks in place for that.
 AkarshNeeraj: It definitely should check this
 AkarshNeeraj: Btw, Thanks&#160;:)
 Allis: I'm almost certain it does, so it may just be that you confused two different users with similar names? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 AkarshNeeraj: Umm..No, all users were of different names. I literally saw people changing their score from 80% to 100%. I am new here so I thought that maybe after submitting I would find some way to revisit my code and edit it.
 Allis: Hm... I think it might just be that you're misinterpreting the UI. The board at the end of a clash isn't fixed; submissions will get "bumped down" as better ones come along.
 Insufficient: oof thats the best feeling ever, i wrote a recursive solution to a problem, it wasnt working, so i converted the recursive solution into a dynamic programming solution and it worked
 JBM: that reads weird
 JBM: dp and recursion aren't orthogonal
 Insufficient: if you've completed super computer you can see exactly what i mean, published solution with comments
 Insufficient: i saw a way in this case where i could turn my recursion into dp
 JBM: super computers?
 JBM: isn't that the scheduling one?
 Insufficient: yeah
 JBM: man that's old
 JBM: i don't remember having to do anything as complex
 JBM: what language did you do it in?
 Insufficient: python 3
 Insufficient: i only found this site in like may so is all new to me
 JBM: yeah i'm not going to be able to see your thing then :D
 JBM: well, i'm not going to redo it just to see yours
 JBM: but you've got access to other solutions now
 JBM: i suggest you browsed a few, i can garantee there's more simple than dp
 Insufficient: im sure there are, but it was a nice feeling to be able to do it with DP
 JBM:&#160;:)
 Stilgart: as far as i can remember, the solution can be though as a special case of DP
 Stilgart: but I hardly call it a DP
 Stilgart: Insufficient: almost anyt
 JBM: "a" solution
 Insufficient: and yeah sorry i forgot there is language barrier between solvers
 Stilgart: anything can be done with DP
 Stilgart: JBM: the (expected) solution
 Insufficient: yeah its more just i want to get better at DP so it was nice to be able to do it right, even if in this instance there were simpler solutions
 JBM: try puzzles with the DP tag then&#160;;)
 Insufficient: ooh i see roller coaster has it as a tag, nice thanks
 Insufficient: also i take the tags as loose guidelines, sometimes its good to be original and just try stuff you think might work
 JBM: true that
 SandmanSW96: hey, 
 SandmanSW96: has anyone in here finished 1D Spreadsheet?
 SandmanSW96: monkey crap nevermind lol
 noahkamara: Does anyone know how I can assign a variable like `a = 2`in the Stub Generator?
 Zenoscave: you can't
 Avex: lmao

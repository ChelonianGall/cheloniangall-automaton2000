 JDone: Hi everyone, hope u're fine, I'm looking for a great way to learn about machine learning algorithms, does anyone has any class to suggest to me&#160;?
 MSmits: dont know about a class, but the best place to start is probably building the XOR example from scratch
 MSmits: there's several websites and youtube tutorials
 JDone: thanks, I'm gonna try&#160;!
 MSmits: don't start with tensorflow + keras immediately
 MSmits: then you dont know what actually happens
 MSmits: start using it when you know what the functions from those packages do
 MSmits: this is obvious for any library or package, but when you import math in python, you kinda know what it does, but machine learning   libraries can hide A LOT of important details in their functions
 MSmits: after you do the xor, it might be fun to do MNIST
 MSmits: there's a book that goes through that pretty handily, but i forget the title of it
 JDone: Yeah I heard about other libraries like ML5,... but the most important part is to understand the process I guess, more than the functions. If you remember the name of the book let me know&#160;:)
 MSmits: someone here will know
 MSmits: it's a book from a guy who does tons of ml videos
 MSmits: I think this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk</a>
 MSmits: If you go on there, follow the videos and the links below it, you should get to tons of resources meant for someone like you who is just starting
 therealbeef: There's always the 'bible' of AI, "AI a modern approach" from Russell and Norvig
 MSmits: sounds good
 therealbeef: It's the classic starting textbook of AI majors
 MSmits: if you start with ML, i guess you'll skip a big part of that book right?
 therealbeef: bit thick though
 MSmits: like search algorithms/pathfinding etc.?
 MSmits: bayesian probability
 MSmits: inference
 jacek: xor example from scratch?
 therealbeef: Still interesting subjects to learn about&#160;;) but you're right
 jacek: where could you find one? :thinking:
 MSmits: you wrote this out didnt you?
 MSmits: i never read it because i had already done it with your advice before that
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59631/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59631/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs</a>
 MSmits: right JDone, do that
 jacek: and its free
 MSmits: ye first time is free
 jacek: and nor example is only $4.20
 MSmits: how much is the nand?
 jacek: $21.37
 MSmits: ouch I'll just train separate networks for inverting + and
 MSmits: btw, my oware bot plays perfectly in seeds 48-37 and 9-0 now, rank 10 is the best I can get without training the NN. Started working on it today, but will be a while. No more gains from meta mcts possible
 MSmits: (unless i cheat and start adding stuff from my endgame book to counter book players)
 jacek: i lost to nonNN :s <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/604377269">https://www.codingame.com/replay/604377269</a>
 MSmits: i seriously doubt that's a non-NN
 jacek: huh
 MSmits: my bot was miles ahead of any non-NN and it's not gotten any weaker
 MSmits: Renard is very strong
 MSmits: (for a non-NN)
 MSmits: pretty sure he went the marchete route, but I admit there's a chance I am wrong
 MSmits: I think darkhorse is the first non-NN on that list
 MSmits: possibly Chibikko but i doubt it
 MSmits: Look at it this way: re curses bot was 5 rating points ahead of any non-NN for months. I only got near him by counterbooking him. Without that I was 3-4 rating below him and 1-2 above everyone else
 MSmits: (except you and robo ofc)
 MSmits: I PM-ed renard so I guess we'll know
 Risodu: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: what you think about it
 MSmits: no lewd suggestions Automaton2000 or we will recode you
 Automaton2000: that's why i needed to do some research
 MSmits: don't research it!
 MalaysiaGamer_Fish: hello
 Thorcode: hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: but the trick is to use a neural net
 Mayankch: pikachu
 jacek: :upside_down:
 struct: hi
 ScienceGuy66:&#160;:)&#160;:(&#160;:)&#160;:(
 ScienceGuy66: :nerd::nerd::nerd::nerd::nerd:
 Chibikko: &gt; possibly Chibikko but i doubt itNN, AlphaZero-like without any tricks
 jacek: what are tricks for alphazero? :o
 PringleOrange: hi, is it possible to lose CP for getting a bad score in something?
 struct: yes
 Chibikko: I don't know. Maybe endgame book?
 jacek: i see
 jacek: so normal alphazero like
 MSmits: so top 15, everyone is nn except darkhorse and me?
 MSmits: I think even some below top 15 are nn :P
 jacek: only cool kids use nn
 MSmits: apparently&#160;:)
 struct: !ban NNs
 Chibikko: No. NNs are the future
 MSmits: still feels a bit  like outsourcing your own brain 
 MSmits: no need to even understand the game you're coding a bot for, except to minimal depth
 MSmits: there's something sad about that
 jacek: still you need design the nn
 MSmits: yes there's new interesting parts about this, but it's a different skill
 MSmits: you lose something real when moving from old-style bots to nn's
 MSmits: and you gain something else
 actualCoderTrevor: Anyone know if the Spring Challenge will go back to the old format?
 PringleOrange: Other than line racing and mad pod racing, what's an easy bot programming thing that I can do for easy CP?
 struct: Line racing maybe
 jacek: he said that ~
 struct: ah lol
 jacek: reading mod :unamused:
 struct: maybe hypersonic
 struct: or you can just make a mcts and the use it on all board games
 Astrobytes: hi struct, how's the sfml/imgui going?
 struct: I paused it for a bit, after I tried a few things on the eval
 Astrobytes: any improvement?
 struct: my bot had like 50% win rate with no eval vs my current one for some reason
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: huh
 struct: or it was 50% by only evaling pawns
 struct: or something
 struct: maybe the way I do the eval on ept is wrong
 Astrobytes: not sure there is a wrong way per se, as long as you're consistent
 jacek: you can be wrongly consistent
 Astrobytes: wrong consistently or consistently wrong? :P
 struct: after I reach certain depth on the rollout I do
 struct: eval(p0) - eval(p1)
 struct: or the inverse based on who owns the node
 Astrobytes: score range?
 struct: 0-1
 struct: for each eval
 struct: so it can be -1, 1
 struct: But its always very close to 0 I think
 struct: thats the problem I have
 jacek: eval(p0)&#160;!= -eval(p1)&#160;?
 struct: wdym jacek?
 Astrobytes: zero-sum eval
 Astrobytes: minimax-style
 jacek: whats in eval(..)
 jacek: eval(p0) and eval(p1) should be related somehow no?
 struct: so I should try to score based on if p0&gt;p1
 struct: they are the same
 Astrobytes: treat it just like minimax eval
 struct: but p0 evals p0 and p1 evals p 1
 jacek: ok i think its alright
 Astrobytes: usually with EPT I return something other than -1,0,1 tbh, don't think it matters much though
 Scarfield: i dont think it matters, you have to adjust the exploration constant though
 Astrobytes: yep
 Scarfield: oi
 Astrobytes: hehe how's things?
 Wontonimo: :wave: Scarfield&#160;!
 Scarfield: good good how bout you?&#160;:)
 Scarfield: hey wonto
 Astrobytes: same ol' crap, different day, can't complain&#160;:)
 <b>**Astrobytes throws a taco in the air</b></p><p><img src="/a/66410221972570" /> Ninilin: hey dont throw the food
 Scarfield: Astrobytes cat is happy for food on the floor
 Astrobytes: It's for Wontonimo to catch. Taco Golf
 Scarfield: xD
 Wontonimo: xD

 Husoski: ProCrazyCoder Old enough to remember punched cards? (I am!)
 ProCrazyCoder: Husoski&#160;:) I'm old enough to remember floppy disk
 Husoski: Close...Floppies were invented about the time I started coding.
 ProCrazyCoder: Hah, I would like to look at punched cards
 jacek: why would you punch cards? what did they do?
 ProCrazyCoder: interesting question
 ProCrazyCoder: Maybe they are first SSD) 
 Husoski: Here's a look at GitHub, circa 1970: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/images/icp/C854721S34852J03/us__en_us__ibm100__punched_card__hand_cards__940x727.jpg">https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/images/icp/C854721S34852J03/us__en_us__ibm100__punched_card__hand_cards__940x727.jpg</a>
 Uljahn: i remember those were called perforated cards (perfocards)
 Husoski: Not in the US
 Uljahn: i mean in USSR
 ProCrazyCoder: i think USSR have punch cards after US
 Husoski: Here, they were often called "IBM cards" because IBM made most of the equipment. (...and *invented* most of the techology.)
 Husoski: Even DEC/Univac/etc. shops used IBM keypunch equipment for data entry.
 Husoski: Mainframe makers made their own card readers and punched card output devices, though...
 Dren: I feel like associating a thing with the brand/company that makes it is a uniquely US practice though
 ProCrazyCoder: Xerox:)
 Husoski: Google?
 Husoski: Hand me a kleenex, I'm gonna sneeze!
 ProCrazyCoder: oh yeah i know what is kleenex
 ProCrazyCoder: but in russia we do not have it
 ProCrazyCoder: What do you think about 30nm russian processor Elbrus?
 Husoski: Don't know about it.  Is is pin compatible with anything that has an affordable motherboard?
 Uljahn: better than nothing :slight_smile:
 ProCrazyCoder: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://filearchive.cnews.ru/img/news/2020/05/06/mb605.jpg">https://filearchive.cnews.ru/img/news/2020/05/06/mb605.jpg</a>
 jacek: 30nm? what year is it
 ProCrazyCoder: 2021:)
 Husoski: Wikipedia's en-us article on Ebrus-8S say it's a 28 nm processor.  Other sources say the Ebrus-8C is either 28 or 24 nm.  
 Husoski: Too small for me to see, even using my "reading in bed" glassis!
 ProCrazyCoder: Yes it 28nm but it's very far from AMD or Intel 
 Blokops: i hate homework so much im procastianitng by doing practice problems
 ProCrazyCoder: But anyway i think its important many others thing like CPU cache and so on
 ProCrazyCoder: Blokops lv22 seems to me that you are not procrastinator
 Blokops: I can do programing problems without any issues but when i need to do a 10 page essay is when the problem start
 ProCrazyCoder: language essay?
 Blokops: programing theory
 Blokops: need to find a paper about machine lerning
 Blokops: and make an essay about it
 ProCrazyCoder: that's seems interesting to me even it's not easy
 ProCrazyCoder: anyway everything will be paid later
 ProCrazyCoder: I ve got a project in the university about ML
 Andrisssd: hey guys, is it easy to switch c# to php?
 ProCrazyCoder: switch in life?
 Andrisssd: like start learning php with c# knowledge
 ProCrazyCoder: for my experience i ve been learning c++ and used a little php, and it seemed to me that there is the same logic in loops, conditions and so on
 ProCrazyCoder: but for more deeper difference in them better ask more experienced  coders
 Andrisssd: waiting for some answers from more experienced coders already&#160;:)  but thank you for attention
 ToasterKeyboard: Hello! Is there a way to increase the difficulty when problemsolving?
 KiwiTae: ToasterKeyboard yes you can do it while drunk or stuf like that
 KiwiTae: o/
 KiwiTae: or try to solve harder problems
 ToasterKeyboard: Is it possible to skip the easier problems in the problem trees? I found that most are around CF Div2 A and B
 5DN1L: What problem trees? Anyway, you can always choose whatever puzzle you want to solve here:
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>

 Thorcode: Hi Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: meh: last weeks d&amp;b has two newcomers in top3 and interestingly now everyone else is in a loop
 Thorcode: Automaton2000 who code you?
 Automaton2000: yes, you need to keep it simple
 Thorcode: do you know how to reach legend in CBS Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: if you take into account the fact that i don't use it anymore
 Blokops: Automaton2000 who is your favorite user in this chat
 Automaton2000: so i figured it out
 Blokops: Automaton2000 well tell us if you figure it out
 Automaton2000: only you can answer that

 C26_1: Hmmm, I want to make a binary calcultor
 C26_1: calculator*
 C26_1: where we have 4 basics operator
 C26_1: ^ &amp; ~ |
 C26_1: That represents for XOR, AND, NOT and OR operators of 2 nputs
 C26_1: inputs*
 C26_1: and each inputs is decimal
 Blokops: what are you using
 Blokops: langauge
 C26_1: @Blokops, Python
 C26_1: And I'm gonna search how can we made calculators using code 
 C26_1: And after that.....
 C26_1: Wait
 Blokops: just do bin(number)[2:] 
 Blokops: no wait better
 C26_1: I mean the input looks like this
 Blokops: result = num1 &amp; num 2print(bin(result)[2:]
 Blokops: that will work
 C26_1: ~5 = 010 = 2
 C26_1: @Blokops, ok
 Blokops: no need to bianry before operation
 Blokops: &amp; | and ^ are aready in python
 Blokops: is like +, -, *
 C26_1: And parethesis, I forgot
 C26_1: (5^2)&amp;(~3|5)
 C26_1: It should look like this if you want
 C26_1: Wait for me a second
 Blokops: you can abuse the eval function
 Blokops: basically you can pass a string and eval will take it as a legal operation
 Blokops: eval("1024 + 1024")
 Blokops: like so

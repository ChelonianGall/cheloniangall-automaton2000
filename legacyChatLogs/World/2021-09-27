 Benji-the-scripter: Cool
 Benji-the-scripter: Im just new as you probably know, what to do?
 Benji-the-scripter: I mean like you know what to do?
 BlaiseEbuth: Depends of your knowledge and your goals...
 Benji-the-scripter: im new to coding so i dont know much, please dont hate me as other persons do
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't hate you.

 raizbro: just clik
 Uljahn: stop spamming
 Thorcode: what the different
 raizbro: in the yello 
 raizbro: tyiping
 raizbro: what is spamming
 Uljahn: posting something nobody asked for
 Uljahn:  multiple times
 howdoyoulive: lol, why results are different every time I submit, I didn't change even 1 blank space.
 howdoyoulive: but the result from 81 to 90 and to 100.
 Uljahn: could be a performance issue
 Uljahn: when your code is on the verge of a timeout
 raizbro: What is spam
 howdoyoulive: Hmm, timeout...but isn't the longest input data in horse racing duals puzzle will be the last few case?

 Benji-the-scripter: Hello
 Benji-the-scripter: Im back from a 50 min break
 raizbro: what
 Benji-the-scripter: i have been gone for 50 mins
 Benji-the-scripter: now im back
 Uljahn: sry was afk
 Benji-the-scripter: hello Uljahn!
 Benji-the-scripter: Sorry for yesterday
 Uljahn: np
 Benji-the-scripter: thx
 Thorcode: nice Benji
 Benji-the-scripter: So i havent found a solution for the second AI quest yet, but what is the thing with angels. Im doing this for fun but not when it takes 30 min for a singel script
 Thorcode: so
 Benji-the-scripter:&#160;?
 Thorcode: what are you coding
 Thorcode: in the bot programing
 Uljahn: guess it's csb
 Benji-the-scripter: yes
 Benji-the-scripter: prob not for me
 Benji-the-scripter: right
 Uljahn: just skip it for now
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Thorcode: yeah
 derjack: its tutorial game
 Benji-the-scripter: then what to do
 Thorcode: And try diffrent bot
 derjack: easy puzzles maybe
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Uljahn: ye, always choose feasible tasks
 Thorcode: and reach bronze
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Benji-the-scripter: algorithms?
 Thorcode: ok
 Benji-the-scripter: thx
 Uljahn: try ghost in the cell maybe
 Benji-the-scripter: already did
 Benji-the-scripter: not much tho
 Thorcode: ghost in the cell is terrible
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Uljahn: have you read the official tutorial?
 Benji-the-scripter:&#160;???

 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Uljahn: also there is CSB guide
 Benji-the-scripter: then i complet
 Benji-the-scripter: little bit esasier
 Thorcode: where can I find the guide
 Uljahn: although not the guide just some tips
 Benji-the-scripter: ok
 Thorcode: well this is the first time I realize CG has guide
 Benji-the-scripter: tried to find a guide yesterday took 1 houer 30 min and nothing i found 
 Uljahn: have you searched the forum?
 Benji-the-scripter: not yet
 AtomicTraveller_a4f6: hi
 Benji-the-scripter: hi
 AtomicTraveller_a4f6: sup
 Tobey: :innocent:
 Thorcode: guys, after I reach top 1000 what is the next quest
 Thorcode: to become coding speed legend
 Benji-the-scripter: Hi 
 Uljahn: Thorcode: win 3 clashes in a row i guess
 wyenat: Yep, 3 in a row. If you want to cheese this, it's possible to launch a clash with only 1 other guy if you're the first person in the room, that makes it significantly easier
 derjack: people cheat on clashes? oO
 raizbro: no
 estipx: wassyo
 estipx: ah!

 eulerscheZahl: ohai
 eulerscheZahl: oh, only 2h left for <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/72912a56c4a75ed56fde3c4745857337d18d">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/72912a56c4a75ed56fde3c4745857337d18d</a>
 Astrobytes: greetings
 derjack: should i approve it without bot?
 Wontonimo: no, make a bot and test
 BlaiseEbuth: So 2017...
 eulerscheZahl: looks cool but i haven't taken the time to test it yet. looks like it has to take an extra turn
 derjack: eeyup. also no leagues
 BlaiseEbuth: Contributor gonna gain xp, everything is alright.
 eulerscheZahl: was much easier to get those games through at the beginning when there were less community games
 eulerscheZahl: not everyone wants to pull a JB M
 BlaiseEbuth: You're sayin' that...
 eulerscheZahl: seriously, that troll thing game him more XP than creating a whole community contest. and probably also reaching legend during the contest
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah, he better create a community contest!Wait...
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: just saying effort-wise a community contest can easily take a month or two. with intensely working on it
 struct: just like a board game that takes me 1 day
 struct: and most of that time is spent on the statement
 eulerscheZahl: now compare rule complexity and visual effect between your game and the community contests
 struct: ofc
 struct: I get its a lot more work
 struct: just not rewarded
 eulerscheZahl: true
 AntiSquid: so his troll game is the ultimate troll&#160;!! considering xp gain :D
 AntiSquid: where is it though&#160;? was it approved&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: it was never up for approval
 eulerscheZahl: he probably forgot to put it up as WIP. but don't ping him
 eulerscheZahl: he also deleted the bot comments when the 30 days have passed
 wlesavo: damn thats a regretful timeout on submit
 wlesavo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/582984769">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/582984769</a>
 struct: unlucky
 struct: Does it happen often?
 wlesavo: first time i see, otk move failed from neighb cell to hq, usually it sarts more far away
 Kryptic_shadow: just finished a clash for the first time and failed. i need coaching 
 struct: do puzzles instead
 Uljahn: together with a coach :tada:
 Schwase: try to not worry about the other players, also puzzles are definitely a good way to help you figure out and play around with better intuitive solutions for code problems that you will find will transfer well into clash
 ja_fica: Someone here can help me out on vectorization?
 ja_fica: why this does not get vectorized: for(int i = size-1; i&gt;=jumpsr;i--) {
 ja_fica: actually that gets vectorized, but not this one
 ja_fica: for(int i = 0; i&lt;size-jumpsr;i++) {
 darkhorse64: :nerd:
 ja_fica: it makes no sense, the backward version getting vectorized and not the sequential one
 ja_fica: should I writte it backward to see if I get lucky?
 ja_fica: Thats the problem, I can't because I would destroy the values
 darkhorse64: If you have a data dependency, it may explain your issue
 struct: darkhorse64 do you plan to change anything else on loa?
 struct: yes
 jacek: :tada:
 struct: Also iterative deepening
 struct: But I still dont use stuff from previous searches
 darkhorse64: On the game itself, no. Astrobytes idea on draw by repetition is interesting but I am afraid draw detection would hamper bot performance. I still need to write a boss to complete the game 
 jacek: should i write the boss? :imp:
 darkhorse64: You want to have your own league&#160;?
 jacek: jacek league, above the legend
 darkhorse64: it would still be a wood league
 Benji-the-scripter: hi
 jacek: ohai
 struct: I guess the draw by repetition would help
 struct: Dont know how hard it is to detect
 jacek: for referee side, easy
 jacek: but do repetitions happen frequently on loa?
 struct: kinda
 struct: When its forced moves to defend
 darkhorse64: detecting draw repetitions during playouts is doable, hash the board at each turn, search/store in a map. But it is going to cost cycles 
 Astrobytes: Is the movegen really that slow?
 Astrobytes: (I haven't coded anything yet)
 Astrobytes: wrt the draw repetition check being overly expensive
 struct: I can call moveGen 500k times in 100ms
 struct: in the initial position
 Astrobytes: Hm. I mean the draw repetition thing would reduce game lengths in some cases but is not essential.
 jacek: checkers dont have draw by repetition though i use it in my bot
 Schwase: when you leave in an entire line of commented out code in shortest mode&#160;:(
 jacek: oO
 Schwase: 49 characters lmaooo
 Schwase: i got 212
 Schwase: so 50 with the new line character counting
 Schwase: like 25% of my code was a commented line hahaa
 Schwase: theres 2 minutes left so i doubt itll cost me but thats pretty funny
 eulerscheZahl: is it?
 Schwase: you mean new lines? yeah each new line is worth 1 char
 Schwase: i know this because when i used to only know java i would have all my code on 1 line
 eulerscheZahl: I was referring to "thats pretty funny"
 jacek: java on shortest mode :scream:
 jacek: grumpy euler
 eulerscheZahl: :older_man:
 Astrobytes: :fist: :cloud: 
 BlaiseEbuth: fist cloud&#160;?
 jrke: finally fall challenge date released
 Astrobytes: old man shakes fist at cloud
 BlaiseEbuth: Hura...
 Astrobytes: fall challenge lol
 jrke: wait is fall challenge coding escape contest?
 Astrobytes: yes
 jacek: yes..
 Astrobytes: A few hours long. No CP.
 jrke: :slight_frown:
 BlaiseEbuth: Welcome in my reality
 kovi: no cp, will i stay #1 forever?
 darkhorse64: duration: 168 hours&#160;?!
 eulerscheZahl: let's see how it goes, maybe we'll see a bot contest again one day
 eulerscheZahl: or they completely remove that leaderboard? who knows
 jrke: why did they combined coding escape with codingame contests?
 jrke: :frowning2:
 struct: marketing
 eulerscheZahl: at least we can keep our #external-contests on discord to look for alternatives
 Schwase: damn ive been thoroughly owned&#160;:\guess ill see you all for groundhog day. glhf
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah 168h is a perfect duration for people who don't had time to participate to bot challenge, as someone said... :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1tuh19i">https://prnt.sc/1tuh19i</a>
 eulerscheZahl: what's this?
 BlaiseEbuth: Button?
 eulerscheZahl: for what?
 jrke: looks like register button
 Astrobytes: The register button?
 Astrobytes: You can see it says 'register'
 eulerscheZahl: ok, then i won't click it
 darkhorse64: I have the fr version which looks OK
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i see the full button on fullscreen
 jacek: fr version looks OK except for the words :v
 jrke: no more bot contest then this year?
 eulerscheZahl: not on CG at least
 struct: ah its now official
 eulerscheZahl: you missed yare
 struct: time to delete
 darkhorse64: true. I didn't even noticed
 jrke: why??they already stopped community contest now official contest is going to be for escape :head_bandage:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, and they have the corporate eam-building link on the contest page even
 Astrobytes: não struct, never again
 eulerscheZahl: we saw it coming long ago jrke&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: the only question: will this be a one-time thing or will it happen more often?
 eulerscheZahl: imagine an escape room SDK
 Astrobytes: One would imagine it depends on the success of this attempt
 eulerscheZahl: escape community contests
 Astrobytes: lol, no, just no
 jacek: lets boycott
 eulerscheZahl: let's see how it works out. i won't play
 Astrobytes: I won't either.
 eulerscheZahl: Thursday is blocked for me. but even if i were free, I wouldn't
 Astrobytes: I just won't.
 jrke: its a 7 day long contest!
 jrke: too short for bot contest too long for escape
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think that solving it will take that long. but didn't even read the description yet
 eulerscheZahl: but 168h? what about not scaring off anyone?
 jrke: we will fall this fall challenge
 eulerscheZahl: who will join when you think that you have to invest that much time?
 BlaiseEbuth: Boycott of 5% of the users will not change anything.
 Astrobytes: Seems weird.
 eulerscheZahl: i will just wait and see what happens :popcorn:
 BlaiseEbuth: If that duration could make it fail...
 Astrobytes: indeed euler
 jrke: why did they gave it name as `codingame fall challenge 2021` then it should be `codingescape fall challenge 2021`
 eulerscheZahl: the suggestions when you watch the video till the end&#160;:(<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1tui60u">https://prnt.sc/1tui60u</a>
 eulerscheZahl: codingame still has a big name that can attract players
 jrke: :cry:

 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-coded-escape">https://thedailywtf.com/articles/a-coded-escape</a>linking this mostly because of the title
 Astrobytes: nice bug nonetheless
 jrke: i am amazed that after finishing of contest will they show the report on finished contest page!
 eulerscheZahl: the only thing that surprises me: no prizes? i would have expected a few to catch even more players
 Astrobytes: NO PRIZES?
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i don't see any mentioned
 BlaiseEbuth: Participating is a prize by itself. :smirk:
 jrke: though they still mentioned multiplayer
 Astrobytes: well yeah, it's a team event
 jacek: there are t-shirts
 eulerscheZahl: it's a typo
 jacek: for top 5 teams
 Astrobytes: = multiplayer
 BlaiseEbuth: One t-shirt by team.
 eulerscheZahl: jacek on wikipedia this would be a [citation needed]
 jacek: get along t-shirt

 BlaiseEbuth: No codinghubs -&gt; no goodies -&gt; more money
 eulerscheZahl: that was known before jrke, Thibaud clarified it here on chat

 Astrobytes: It won't.
 eulerscheZahl: best chance to get an update on this page: a contest creator has to change the nickname
 Astrobytes: lol, grim

 struct: yes
 VilgotanL: mogus
 struct: darkhorse64 do you want to use my bot as the boss?
 struct: Ill still need to imrpove it though
 eulerscheZahl: do you want an unbeatable boss?
 struct: no but I dont want a weak boss either
 Wontonimo: make as strong a boss as you can.  then to nerf it, you can just give it less time or cap its depth
 eulerscheZahl: didn't work well for the kutulu contest boss
 swaggycat: mous
 Astrobytes: Was that Dora?
 BlaiseEbuth: Remember remember tibo and johny not abble to reach bronze...
 eulerscheZahl: one day i came home to see that they took my 1k lines bot and place it as the last wood boss, just waiting every 10th turn
 eulerscheZahl: that boss later became the silver boss
 eulerscheZahl: (also with reduced depth)
 eulerscheZahl: i might have found a first hint for the escape contest already. the candles have Roman numerals written on them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl did u win that jovi.io thing?
 BlaiseEbuth: Plan change. Make a team -&gt; Rush the contest -&gt; Share solutions.
 eulerscheZahl: got 2nd. already received the 0.3ETH
 PatrickMcGinnisII: nice!!!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gratz!
 Astrobytes: Speaking of poo, that guy with the axe looks like he's squeezing one out
 eulerscheZahl: thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: Astrobytes :rofl:
 eulerscheZahl: pooping candles?
 Astrobytes: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: 0.3ETH -&gt; $
 eulerscheZahl: it's the highest prize i've ever won
 eulerscheZahl: and just days after the Huawei watch finally arrived. my sister might even take it
 darkhorse64: struct: I'll think about it
 jacek: 1 eth is 2800usd hm?
 BlaiseEbuth: So 769.98€
 struct: im already creating the opening book
 eulerscheZahl: yes. it's huge for my contest success standards
 BlaiseEbuth: Not even a day salary...
 eulerscheZahl: could probably earn more if i invest the same time in a real job. but where's the fun?
 Astrobytes: lol
 BlaiseEbuth: Na na why don't you get a job?
 jrke: which contest euler?
 BlaiseEbuth: Pirate contest
 Wontonimo: congrats eulerscheZahl 
 BlaiseEbuth: 5000$ for the codeforce thing! :money_mouth:
 leojean890: still didn't get my RAIC t shirt xD
 Astrobytes: same
 leojean890: o/ Astrobytes
 leojean890: idk why they take so long :P
 struct: one day ill win a shirt from any of these contests
 struct: First ill need to learn how to code
 leojean890: RAIC you only need to reach round 2, not a big deal^^
 Astrobytes: ^ this
 jrke: RAIC? russian ai cup?
 leojean890: yes^^
 Astrobytes: yeah
 struct: wait maybe I can win a shirt from escape
 struct: Since i dont really need to know how to code
 Astrobytes: lol, burn
 BlaiseEbuth: If you participate you'll be killed by fire

 jrke: oh gratz

 eulerscheZahl: they just tell you to fill out a form until a certain date. then you do it and wait for the parcel. 2 months later they send you another link with a new deadline for filling it out
 leojean890: I got an email from all prizes AI cup 2 months ago and then nothing :P
 eulerscheZahl: once i was waiting for 11 months until i received it
 leojean890: I see^^
 eulerscheZahl: but so far it always arrived
 leojean890: I didn't understand the email, I filled the form on their website during the contest:)
 leojean890: address etc
 eulerscheZahl: on the other side i contacted topcoder twice about a tshirt that the owe me, no reaction so far
 leojean890: oh ok, weird also
 eulerscheZahl: you have to be careful with those Russian emails. if you miss it, you won't get your tshirt
 leojean890: got them and should translate them yes:p
 eulerscheZahl: and I always fail to pick a different size for hoodie and tshirt. then i get an M hoodie that's a bit small
 BlaiseEbuth: SVR...
 eulerscheZahl: i mean i correctly select L but then it overwrites itself when i order the tshirt
 leojean890: weird :o
 BlaiseEbuth: SVR know your size.
 eulerscheZahl: what's SVR?
 BlaiseEbuth: Modern KGB
 Astrobytes: FSB no?
 jrke: will fall challenge will be visible in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://clist.by/">https://clist.by/</a>&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: who knows
 eulerscheZahl: ask aropan. or wait a bit, he supposedly calls the contest APIs of all those websites regularly
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/user/login.action">https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/user/login.action</a>that's worth noting btw
 eulerscheZahl: team event but was fun last year
 struct: no bot contests&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: that was the one you did with zeno and ille?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: and squiddy
 Astrobytes: ah yes
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. What's this list?
 eulerscheZahl: clist?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes
 eulerscheZahl: check the #external-contests topic
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh... I don't go on discord anymore
 Astrobytes: What's the point in having a discord channel for the escape room anyway? Can't they just use the #coding-escape channel? Not like anyone will be sharing info
 eulerscheZahl: finding teams maybe
 eulerscheZahl: your status "already escaped" :D
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 MiyamuraIzumi: well CodingEscape&#160;:(
 MiyamuraIzumi: it is now official
 Astrobytes: It was official since Tibo confirmed it, I mean he is CG staff...
 eulerscheZahl: it was unofficially official long ago
 BlaiseEbuth: Sort of
 eulerscheZahl: i just saw that clash of bots got approved so close to the end of the deadline
 eulerscheZahl: interesting concept of each bot having limited vision and doesn't know the own location
 wlesavo: reminds coding game sponsored contest
 eulerscheZahl: a bit, yes
 eulerscheZahl: random order of robots in the input. makes it really hard to put things together
 eulerscheZahl: might even be 1 step too much
 eulerscheZahl: and they did it in Kotlin
 Astrobytes: could have been Clojure!
 eulerscheZahl: who dares to pin martynas message on the discord contest channel? :imp:
 BlaiseEbuth: Clojure is still not fixed. And will not be...
 eulerscheZahl: could have been scala
 eulerscheZahl: the original vindinium was in Scala
 Astrobytes: ewww
 jrke: :grimacing: who do you think can do that dare?
 Astrobytes: lol euler :rofl:
 BlaiseEbuth: Do it...
 eulerscheZahl: "do it"<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnGYxO_3H6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnGYxO_3H6I</a>
 jrke: :joy:
 Astrobytes: wtf
 Astrobytes: Darwin Award needed
 MiyamuraIzumi: well still can't unregister for FC2021
 jrke: unfortunately we can't!
 eulerscheZahl: that's to protect yourself
 eulerscheZahl: it's a feature
 eulerscheZahl: oh, *un*registermy reading skills
 Astrobytes: Doesn't matter. No CP, won't affect your contest ratings
 Astrobytes: Just don't play
 eulerscheZahl: it helps CG to blow up the numbers artificially and justify another round
 MiyamuraIzumi: haha
 MiyamuraIzumi: don't play
 Astrobytes: lol :salt:
 Wontonimo: maybe last minute change of rules, and +500 CP "participation" award... oh, the outcry if that happened 
 StevenV: haha
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a FC2020 participant at least<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=53951108611381">https://www.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=53951108611381</a>
 jacek: proud of participation medal eh
 Astrobytes: The bestest badge ever!
 Astrobytes: "Mommy I did a thing!"
 eulerscheZahl: let me see if i can scale it up on my profile
 StevenV: how can you have the medal?
 eulerscheZahl: tbh my profile looked really trash with that badge when it suddenly showed up on the yare stream :D
 Nerchio: rip fall challenge 2021
 Astrobytes: lol euler
 Astrobytes: indeed Nerchio
 Westicles: they should add every puzzle to golf to keep CP going
 MiyamuraIzumi: maybe we will never have any medal like these anymore
 Nerchio: community contests died for this
 AllYourTrees: did some info come out about FC 2021??
 Wontonimo: i don't see an easy way of seeing replays in yare 
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 AllYourTrees: link?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/escape/fall-challenge-2021">https://www.codingame.com/contests/escape/fall-challenge-2021</a>
 jrke: AllYourTrees unfortunately yes
 AllYourTrees: so the rumors were true eh
 MiyamuraIzumi: it is not rumor
 MiyamuraIzumi: it is annoucement
 eulerscheZahl: Wontonimo you can hover over the matches and click the paper clip to get the replay links on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://challonge.com/yare">https://challonge.com/yare</a>
 AllYourTrees: ya i heard rumors a month or two ago that this is what it was gonna be
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 MiyamuraIzumi: and now it is just confirm again on the site
 AllYourTrees: so there's no bot programming thing like internal to the escape? like you have to beat a boss to escape or something?
 eulerscheZahl: there was even a staff member speculating about a new contest format on the forum before the spring challenge even
 eulerscheZahl: the coding skills required will be clash level at most
 Nerchio: yes these are usually quite fun but you finish in 30min-1h and thats it
 struct: tr 'ACGT', 'TGCA'
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 Nerchio: cant compare it to a contests that we are used to
 struct: puzzles on that level
 MiyamuraIzumi: but escape is just annouced serveral weeks ago
 MiyamuraIzumi: I've played Escape
 MiyamuraIzumi: somehow, it is cool, but somehow, I am really bad at it
 struct: sure its fun but I dont see it fit for a contest format
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/solo-contests/1114/3">https://forum.codingame.com/t/solo-contests/1114/3</a>this is where the story begins
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not a contest, it's an advertising.
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan likes this
 BlaiseEbuth: Traitor
 MiyamuraIzumi: I was expect something more thrill
 struct: Everyone make a fantastic bits bot
 struct: is the best revenge
 MiyamuraIzumi: like when CG switch from Optimalz to bot
 MiyamuraIzumi: but Escape is urrrg
 AllYourTrees: why is that the best revenge?
 Westicles: the question is which team gets madknight
 struct: Because illedan is trying to get rank 2 or 1
 eulerscheZahl: just playing our own bot contest
 MiyamuraIzumi: yeah, great idea
 eulerscheZahl: isn't MK banned? i didn't follow the whole story
 BlaiseEbuth: I banned him.
 BlaiseEbuth: The CM said he gonna unban him. But does the CM did what he said? Always a great question...
 Wontonimo: why ban?  he tried to teach you CSB?
 eulerscheZahl: you are the next Wontonimo
 BlaiseEbuth: Anton... /3
 eulerscheZahl: teaching people CSB in private message
 Westicles: yeah, watch out the next server reset
 Wontonimo: i've already been banned 
 eulerscheZahl: really?
 eulerscheZahl: what have you done?
 Wontonimo: i'm banned right now
 BlaiseEbuth: Naa... They added a script to unmod me.
 MiyamuraIzumi: csb
 Wontonimo: this is the banned channel right?
 eulerscheZahl: are you MK's alt?
 Wontonimo: i guess i need to try harder to get banned
 Wontonimo: no, i'm a real boy, not some alt of someone else
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was/is, tired of MK PM'ing me.  I was getting port attacked, i dunno how the correlate - but they seem to.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: why was he banned?
 Wontonimo: no.  to be clear for those who don't know the running joke of me being banned (but not actually ever having been banned).  I don't have an alt account (other than antiwonto) and I've never been banned
 aCat: eulerscheZahl there will be no normal contest&#160;?
 MiyamuraIzumi:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: not for fall challenge 2021
 aCat: ...
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know abot the future. probably even CG doesn't know yet
 aCat: go to hell CG, see ya next year
 AllYourTrees: i get it though, they need income right?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 Astrobytes: aCat: don't hold back brother!
 AllYourTrees: i'd pay to do CG contests lol
 eulerscheZahl: i can also understand why they do it. i'm still sad
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, new bot prog...clash of bots
 aCat: why not boycott this?
 MiyamuraIzumi: Escape is more that clash of bots
 eulerscheZahl: lots of people offered to pay for some premium account over the years
 Astrobytes: aCat: I ain't doing it
 aCat: I can prepare some game, and we can make community contest in the same time ^^'
 Astrobytes: I would be happy with that
 eulerscheZahl: that's exactly what I tried with tryangle catch
 MiyamuraIzumi: me too
 eulerscheZahl: took me months to code
 eulerscheZahl: 50 players now :tada:
 AllYourTrees: :tada:
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII raises hand</b></p><p><img src="/a/4210501575817" /> aCat: yeah, but the game is hard
 aCat: cool, but complicated
 Astrobytes: Damn I still have to get on that, I have half a bot
 eulerscheZahl: for a contest it shouldn't be that trivial
 jrke: yeah but interesting for the contest basis!
 Astrobytes: ^
 aCat: and its hard to get peopl on non-contest multi&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to keep you busy for at least a full week
 Nerchio: im down for tryangle catch as our contest during official contest lel
 Astrobytes: 5%...
 eulerscheZahl: even added extra features like a drawing module where you can make annotations in the replay. things that I want to see for other games. or setting your own fixed color "i'm always red"
 Astrobytes: inspired by the RAIC debug tool iirc
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but broken down to CG constraints
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the 3d module slowed my browser waaaay down on the teris thing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the triangle shading was good
 Astrobytes: Yeah. Was a cool feature
 eulerscheZahl: cat tells me to go to bed now :D
 eulerscheZahl: see you
 Astrobytes: gnight euler
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, give me coffee
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er the cat
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i gtg go 2, meeting the gf soon.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: see ya Patrick, enjoy
 dbf: oh, no multi in fall contest&#160;:(
 Nerchio: :poop: :poop: :poop: :poop: :poop: :poop: :poop: :poop: :poop: :poop: 
 Astrobytes: Fall Fail instead&#160;:(
 struct: Even Automaton2000 knows this now
 Automaton2000: i found a way to get a good bot
 Nerchio: yep if nobody has a bot then every bot is good
 Nerchio: :poop: 
 Nerchio: 5head
 struct: I cant still see the logic in this
 struct: But I dont have any degree is marketing
 Astrobytes: I get that they're trying to push it, but I don't think replacing the bot programming contests with it is particularly sensible
 struct: ofc it isnt, because its a completely diferent audience
 struct: So they say that only 5% is competitive or w/E
 Astrobytes: :shrug emoji:
 struct: so they make a competitive escape
 struct: ...
 dbf: I can't even use it for RAIC promotion, because no RAIC for this year&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: yeah
 Astrobytes: and yeah dbf, double disappointment this year&#160;:(
 Wontonimo: so, is there some anti-csb policy or something?  why all the grief?  
 dbf: but we can spend more time with our families in advance this year, to borrow some time for coding for next year&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: i haven't even been suggesting it
 Wontonimo: since it was pointed out last time
 Wontonimo: like a few weeks ago
 Astrobytes: dbf: hahaha true!
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo: old memes die hard I guess
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Astrobytes: Don't be offended
 Astrobytes: Please
 Westicles: you can recommend this one instead
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/deep-learning-tensorflow">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/deep-learning-tensorflow</a>
 struct: isnt it broken?
 Astrobytes: yeah, tf was removed w/ python2 iirc
 Westicles: well, doing deleted puzzles is all the rage this last week, but there doesn't seem to be any way to pass that one
 struct: maybe if they still have py2 installed
 struct: and you make a system call
 struct: or something
 Astrobytes: didn't they block a bunch of that recently
 Westicles: system calls or playing deleted puzzles?
 Astrobytes: system calls lol
 Astrobytes: or something about access to the whole 'ecosystem'
 Westicles: not sure.  maybe that was something related to zeno scraping all the puzzle solutions
 Astrobytes: could have been yeah, I've not been paying much attention recently
 Wontonimo: anyone interested in trying the new tictactoe contrib?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/894199f1812b7f93203e7db5a30b5ff51dbafb">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/894199f1812b7f93203e7db5a30b5ff51dbafb</a> 
 Wontonimo: my current strategy is just to play the closest available move to the centre of the board
 Wontonimo: no sim, no search
 jacek: needs smits to determine if steal move is needed ~
 struct: YurkovAS are you pruning any moves on Lines of action?
 darkhorse64: Is there really any depth in this game&#160;?
 BooDeer: Hello, I just finished a clash of code and I didn't understand the answer can anyone look at the challenge w/ me?
 BooDeer: (not sure if there's a way to share a challenge that I did or not)
 jacek: you cant
 Wontonimo: it's over
 jacek: darkhorse64 loa?
 darkhorse64: the TTT lookalike
 Wontonimo: it is a ttt lookalike
 Wontonimo: i don't think there is much depth.  maybe
 Wontonimo: it just seems a race to own the middle
 jacek: its 81 deep
 struct: im sure makign a sim for this will be short
 Wontonimo: a copy of connect for code to be sure
 Wontonimo: connect 4
 struct: p2 goes first?
 struct: what is this madness
 jacek: i never did bitboard for over 64 bits
 struct: jacek just use uint128_t
 Wontonimo: 128
 jacek: though i could cheat here with int128
 struct: its uint64_t arr[2]
 struct: ok ill make a bot for it
 Wontonimo: :D
 struct: give me an hour and it should be done
 jacek: a boss eh
 struct: never used uint128 though
 struct: lets see how it goes
 AllYourTrees: i used them for UTTT :shrug:
 struct: oh I have to create 128 bit masks&#160;:/
 struct: maybe its not needed
 struct: no popcount&#160;:(
 electricWah: i just got code that was working completely differently on the site than on my computer
 struct: hmm
 struct: What code?
 Wontonimo: what do you mean no popcount?
 struct: for 128
 YurkovAS: struct ignore lose moves in random rollouts
 struct: ok, also on loses you dont take the longest path do you?
 struct: on proven loses
 YurkovAS: i'm without heuristic (only 10 random moves) and without smart rollouts (only check win and ignore lose)
 struct: minimax king joined
 YurkovAS: when fill next moves: choose win and ignore lose moves. in random rollouts part
 struct: I wont be able to beat him&#160;:(
 YurkovAS: can't find good heuristic: i'm think this improve mcts
 struct: my next step will be to order moves to help minimax
 struct: but ill probably need to rewrite some stuff
 Astrobytes: even just trying the best move from the previous depth in your iterative deepening will help
 AllYourTrees: is there a better strategy in counting TTT than flood filling from your starting position?
 struct: every time you make a play you check how many 3 in a row it created?
 struct: ah you mean strategy
 struct: idk
 struct: I dont really get the game tbh
 Astrobytes: Not sure it seems worth playing, I may be wrong
 fkberthold: Hey folks, I remember some time ago seeing a tutorial on writing your first community puzzle. Can anyone point me to the docs?

 darkhorse64: Just watched the video. Pretty hilarious
 Astrobytes: It's funny as fuck lol
 Astrobytes: But I fear he just put himself on the line with that
 darkhorse64: True, this is not gentle, subtle or whatever but it's very good
 darkhorse64: I did not notice the nickname: carie bde. Will we have a video from Sylla&#160;?
 Astrobytes: what did I miss there
 flipped_a_bit: what are some general optimization tips if we aren't hitting the timeout period on a puzzle?
 flipped_a_bit: I'm already pre-allocating vectors and array-indexing them, instead of pushing each new value
 struct: maybe you are not solving it the right way
 struct: you can try
 struct: at the top of your code
 struct: but its probably algorithm related
 flipped_a_bit: I'm using rust. it's running optimized code server-size, I assume right? rust debug mode is pretty darn slow
 flipped_a_bit: i ran it on my personal computer, gave up after it ran for at least 5 mins, ran it again in release and it took 7 seconds
 flipped_a_bit: I know that's too slow, but my 6 year old computer is probably slower all around haha
 flipped_a_bit: (it produces correct output locally too)
 struct: I think so
 struct: at least on multiplayers
 struct: when you submit its on release mode
 flipped_a_bit: hmm. the roller-coaster puzzle isn't multiplayer though. Did hit submit just to see, but still errored
 struct: do you brute forced it?
 struct: or do you use memoization?
 Uljahn: i think all the puzzles can be solved in python (besides nintendo), so you don't really need fancy optimizations, just the right algo
 flipped_a_bit: I'm doing it iteratively with some small-ish optimizations. would they set the timer so that isn't an option?
 Westicles: heh heh, find the 3rd PS5 elsewhere
 flipped_a_bit: memoized it with a vector (map was still too slow) and fixed the timeout issue, thanks for the help! now just need to figure out what I broke in the process of making changes...
 elderlybeginner: if fall challenge an escape room kind?
 Wontonimo: yes
 miszu: hello all, what are good literature I can read about writing good sims for game engine? I find I always lack structure in my code for that part
 Wontonimo: experience is all i can think of.  write small games and small programs.  practice dividing the Model, View, and the Controller
 miszu: not trying to do mvc. Most of coding challenges you need to write the game simulation yourself. Is there a specific approach?
 Wontonimo: i think you missed my point&#160;: writing a sim is the model + controller part of the MVC of your game
 Wontonimo: if you are strong at writing MVC and breaking down a game into MVC, then use the MC to make the sim
 miszu: ahh I see what you mean yeah makes sense
 miszu: thanks
 Wontonimo: no problem.  unfortunately, i don't think there is any silver bullet
 miszu: I wish it was more like: implement those x functions and that is all you need
 Thorcode: how to import time in pygame?
 Thorcode: oh
 Thorcode: I know how to do it
 ZarthaxX: miszu software design is hard
 ZarthaxX: takes a lot of practice
 ZarthaxX: but you cqan start with the engine thingy
 ZarthaxX: can*
 Thorcode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/CWQLwIQ">https://imgur.com/a/CWQLwIQ</a>

 Thorcode: not bandicam
 struct: notepad++
 Thorcode: oh thanks
 Stephen10121: vsc is my favorite
 Thorcode: VIsual studio code?
 Stephen10121: yeah
 Thorcode: In that app I don't know how to download pip&#160;:(
 Stephen10121: do you use windows?
 Thorcode: yes
 Stephen10121: then you can download nodejs online and pip comes with it.
 Stephen10121: Download link: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>
 theLMGN: you can just install python
 theLMGN: instead of python &amp; nodejs
 Stephen10121: I mistook pip with npm. My bad.
 Wontonimo: struct , i made a UCT sim for counting tictactoe and submitted it
 Wontonimo: it doesn't play much better than just "closest to the middle"
 struct: hmmm
 struct: maybe game is too long
 struct: and not enough games are played
 struct: I had to stop, this game is not really for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wow, yall still online
 Wontonimo: yeah, perhaps.  i'm going to deploy the greedy-centre on another account and see how the two rank
 Wontonimo: deployed
 struct: this one is still mcts?
 antiwonto: yes, and this account deployed greedy
 Wontonimo: yeah MCTS.  Only expands and tries the 20 free positions closest to the centre
 Wontonimo: well, looks pretty decisive.  MCTS  wins out over greedy.  So, i'd say there is actually something to this game
 struct: maybe
 struct: Wontonimo have you by any chance ever tried zobrist hashing?
 antiwonto: nope
 Wontonimo: oops, wrong account
 Wontonimo: still nope
 struct: np
 struct: I get too many collisions if I use the method they recommend
 Wontonimo: how about just shifts of the board xor'd together?  very vanilla simple
 struct: the key doesnt collide
 struct: but collides on the insert
 struct: key&#160;% table_size
 struct: to get the index where it should be added
 struct: unless im doing something wrong
 Wontonimo: here is something that may work for you <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/j1hklZm">https://tech.io/snippet/j1hklZm</a>

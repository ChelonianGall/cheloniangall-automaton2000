 Wontonimo: hey Docer
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Wontonimo, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 203 tacos
 Wontonimo: Automaton2000 , what do you think of tacos?
 Automaton2000: probably a bug in my code, but i can
 kresteodymium: hi
 antiwonto: [auto] 'hi' was defined as ' A common salutation for those who are short of words ' by Wontonimo
 kresteodymium: orz
 Wontonimo: :taco: kresteodymium
 antiwonto: [auto] sorry Wontonimo but you can only award tacos once per day
 Wontonimo:&#160;:(
 kresteodymium: lol
 Wontonimo: how's it goinig kresteodymium&#160;?
 kresteodymium: going well ig
 kresteodymium: school is not fun
 kresteodymium: wbu
 Wontonimo: meh.  things are okay i guess.
 Bari: How's everyone day so far?
 Wontonimo: day is done for me.  it was alright
 Wontonimo: hi
 Wontonimo: yeah!  definition removed :tada:

 Darleanow: hello guys&#160;!
 MACKEYTH: Heyo
 Darleanow: why, in code vs zombies, am i getting an errror about "human_x" is possibly unbound when i try to human_x-zombie-x
 Darleanow: zombie_x*
 5DN1L: which programming language
 Darleanow: python
 Darleanow: i'm trying to make the human evaluate the distance for each id and go for the one which is closest to the human
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=python+unbound+error">https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=python+unbound+error</a>
 Darleanow: and i will add another thing to it after, i mean that if theres a zombie next to the one je just killed, he goes for it instead of the next closest one
 Darleanow: but the thing 5DN1L, is that it seems to be referenced after
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/308e600b-244e-4d41-bc76-ab5a50082680">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/308e600b-244e-4d41-bc76-ab5a50082680</a>
 5DN1L: your code seems incomplete?
 5DN1L: distancey=...?
 Darleanow: yeah np about it 
 Darleanow: even though i fill this i will still get an error as the problem is from distancex atm
 5DN1L: check the code in the pastebin
 5DN1L: i don't see anything after distancey=
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/212ec85b-4fac-4fb9-b415-d29d84bbbb9c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/212ec85b-4fac-4fb9-b415-d29d84bbbb9c</a>
 Darleanow: here you go
 Darleanow: but still, i cant a-b unbound values apparently
 5DN1L: which case?
 5DN1L: I tried your code on the first test case and it ran fine
 Darleanow: yes bc i didn't updated it 
 Darleanow: to check now for distance x and y 
 5DN1L: :dizzy_face:
 5DN1L: so where's the code which gave you the error
 Darleanow: invalid input. Expected 'x y' but found '-11999 0'
 5DN1L: If you give me a working code then I cannot point out any error to you :sweat_smile:
 Darleanow: x))
 Darleanow: wait imma do it on my own
 Darleanow: i know i can figure it out :p
 Darleanow: ill go back to you if i'm too bad for it&#160;!
 5DN1L: yes, try it first :wink:
 Darleanow: can't figure how to do it for each zombie id
 5DN1L: what do you mean
 KiwiTae: Darleanow im bit late to the party but that code sample miss indent in zombie loop ~ 
 Ajaiy: @Darleanow print(zombie_xnext, zombie_ynext)But zombie_xnext is referenced outside the loop which contains it

 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: do you speak english&#160;?
 JAMALLREX: I'm sorry 
 JAMALLREX: I will stop doing that
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: ban him
 JAMALLREX: why?
 1plus1equal3becauseaplusbequalc: What is going on.
 JAMALLREX: Did you see? He is against me
 5DN1L: stop arguing here
 Nat-42: Is it tell the mods what to do day?
 JAMALLREX: I did nothing
 5DN1L: Anyone who disrupts the chat will be kicked out
 5DN1L: No more arguments here
 JAMALLREX: ok, i ain't talking about code
 JAMALLREX: my bad
 Darleanow: since when ppl in north korea have access to internet x)
 JAMALLREX: we do have
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: yes that true
 JAMALLREX: we are not in prison here
 Darleanow: lol
 JAMALLREX: stop talking about my country
 TheFlyingdidgeridoo: its freedom
 JAMALLREX: we are free here
 Darleanow: i can talk about whatever i want, why are you so offensive
 Darleanow: are you 12&#160;?
 1plus1equal3becauseaplusbequalc: Don't speak about other thing that has no sens to put here because it's a chat for coding not for trollers.
 5DN1L: Stop that Darleanow
 MaxTheorum: What's going on with this chat
 Darleanow: this guy is a troll
 Darleanow: talking about sht who's not even related to code
 JAMALLREX: Im not , stop!
 Darleanow: and i made a joke
 Darleanow: that's all :p
 MaxTheorum: All I can see in log is mayhem let's keep it friendly on here&#160;:)
 JAMALLREX: yes :grin:
 Darleanow: ofc i'm friendly :p
 Darleanow: just made a joke UwU
 5DN1L: no unnecessary joke, Darleanow, much appreciated
 5DN1L: it's not a good idea to pour more oil onto the flames
 JAMALLREX: Indeed
 5DN1L: And I'm watching you closely JAMALLREX
 Darleanow: okay&#160;:)
 Darleanow: don't understand why, as it's a friendly chat but anyways i'll stop it
 MSmits: Well tbh I was also surprised about North Korea allowing coders on the internet... I mean maybe he could have put the question differently, but it's a legitimate question
 MSmits: it's a very closed country
 5DN1L: it is, only if the other guy did not spam previously...
 MSmits: oh ok
 MSmits: i missed that
 5DN1L: and looked like changed his name and even country a few times
 Darleanow: this is why i made this joke
 MSmits: I see
 Darleanow: because this guy seems to be a troll
 Ho-Sook:&#160;?
 5DN1L: How many times are you changing your name?
 5DN1L: I still know it's you
 5DN1L: Anyway let's not pay attention to him
 Darleanow: and now all the fake accounts going wild on me
 5DN1L: this chat is not for that
 5DN1L: don't waste our time on him
 Darleanow: yeah i got it
 JieGuang: Hi friends is there anywhere I can ask/discuss about clash of code answers?ie I got an answer but would like to see a more efficient code for it
 MaxTheorum: Most people will share their code after the clash of code!

 Ho-Sook: (The puzzle)
 5DN1L: Read the hints on the left first
 MaxTheorum: I'm pretty sure @5DN1L can handle moderating the chat&#160;;)
 Darleanow: they do it with pm's
 Ho-Sook: I did but I don't know which code to write
 Darleanow: by spamming or doing shit
 Ho-Sook:&#160;?
 5DN1L: You may report to [CG]Thibaud, Darleanow
 Darleanow: aight :p
 MaxTheorum: Probably try to reach private support then&#160;:) He can't do anything about it without evidence&#160;:)
 Darleanow: yeah ofc
 MaxTheorum: What 5DN1L said 
 Darleanow: dw&#160;:)
 MaxTheorum: But good luck with it nevertheless spamming is annoying
 5DN1L: Ho-Sook if you don't know any programming languages, please go to some other websites to learn it first. We can't teach you all the basics here
 Ho-Sook: I did nothing, he don't have any arguments or evidences to blaming me
 Darleanow: i mean these lazy kids will prob do something with their hands other than doing shit
 MaxTheorum: Lets keep this out of this chat guys
 1plus1equal3becauseaplusbequalc: Goodbye

 Darleanow: wdym

 Darleanow: something like this&#160;?
 struct: yes
 Darleanow: i can do first move but not the second, theres a problem with my operations 
 5DN1L: sort of
 Darleanow: it timeouts
 struct: but remember that sometimes you need to move diagonally 
 5DN1L: and you don't have to use all those def
 Darleanow: i will update to make this possible after
 Darleanow: it tells me that it's not defined
 struct: yeah because the var is out of scope
 Darleanow: yeah i changed it
 5DN1L: if you use def you have to pass the variables into def

 vinnie_rinella: in the tic tac toe on when the opponet takes the square that the bot is trying to take it breaks the program does anyone know the fix
 vinnie_rinella: here is code
 vinnie_rinella: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4a03b81d-7eae-4538-b3f8-b62788a0dc42">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4a03b81d-7eae-4538-b3f8-b62788a0dc42</a>
 NewCoder09: is this a c++?
 vinnie_rinella: java script
 NewCoder09: then i can't help you but you can ask 5DN1L he will know hess good with javascript
 derjack: you track only the last one opponent's move?
 NewCoder09: or when Struct gets on you can ask him
 derjack: what about the others?
 vinnie_rinella: i dont know how to track those
 vinnie_rinella: 5DN1L can you help me
 5DN1L: NewCoder09 vinnie_rinella  for bot programming stuff asking others is usually a better idea than asking MeiCodes
 5DN1L: asking me*
 5DN1L: derjack can help you
 vinnie_rinella: ok
 NewCoder09: yeah thats why i also said Struct 
 struct: Well to be brutally honest I think you need to learn the basics first
 vinnie_rinella:&#160;?
 struct: basics of programming
 derjack: oO
 struct: The code you pasted doesnt make much sense
 vinnie_rinella: it works mostly though 
 vinnie_rinella: it tells you if that spot is taken and it is pre programed to pick moves in order
 NewCoder09: yeah do your path and do your puzzles once you understand it more you can try the coding again and if you are still having trouble look up a tutorial for "tic tac toe javascript"
 vinnie_rinella: this is the next thing in my path
 NewCoder09: are you trying to reach bronze league?
 vinnie_rinella: yes
 NewCoder08: ok i made a new acc
 Alderi_Tokori: @vinnie_rinella In the code you pasted, I see that you disregard entirely the list of possible moves that gets passed to your program; You should store them in an array and only choose a move to play among those
 Alderi_Tokori: In your code right now, your program is only aware of the very last move your ooponent played, and is completely oblivious to the moves that have been played in previous turns (both by your opponent and you)
 vinnie_rinella: how would i do that
 struct: char arr[3][3];
 Alderi_Tokori: Well, asking yourself that question is the first step towards the correct solution&#160;:) I'll give you a pointer though: you can store any info you want in variables
 struct: then you update after opponent plays a move
 vinnie_rinella: ok
 vinnie_rinella: thank you guys for your help 
 struct: ah its js
 struct: you need a 2d array
 Alderi_Tokori: Also, your program isn't "rebooted" on each turn, it keeps running until the game is over, so any variable you instanciante outside of the while loop will stay there so you can update it and look inside it in subsequent turns
 vinnie_rinella: what does that mean
 Alderi_Tokori: Sorry, english isn't my native language. What I mean is if you declare your variable (in javascript with var &lt;var_name&gt; for example) before the while loop, then it won't be reset on following turns, so inside the while loop you will be able to update or get its content freely
 Alderi_Tokori: Which is how you will be able to store information about the game turn after turn to keep track of the board state
 Wontonimo: hey vinnie_rinella , sounds like you could use some refresher on variables and arrays.  This isn't the place to learn those and this site kinda assumes you already know it.  Try googling for help on that
 vinnie_rinella: ok

 5DN1L: Timeout: the program did not provide 1 input lines in due time...
 nruffier: Yeah I saw
 5DN1L: You may have to use the inputs there and walk through your code manually
 nruffier: But I don't agree, other test take more time before first output and no problem
 5DN1L: probably some kind of bug
 5DN1L: nothing to do with the validator itself
 5DN1L: check your code first
 nruffier: I checked a lot, i ran my code in console with simulated data, it work
 5DN1L: what's the programming language
 nruffier: Groovy
 5DN1L: ah, that one
 5DN1L: not sure if it happens to you, but I have timeout sometimes with Groovy
 nruffier: Yep me too
 5DN1L: I usually solve it by submitting the code a few times
 nruffier: i'll try more
 5DN1L: yes, sorry about guessing your code is buggy
 nruffier: i've sumbitted like 5 times, the 6th make the charm&#160;! XD
 5DN1L: lol
 5DN1L: good
 nruffier: So that was a bug XD
 5DN1L: yeah, on CG's part
 5DN1L: &gt;.&lt;
 nruffier: Thanks a lot anyway&#160;!
 nruffier: I'm always happy when it's not my fault XD
 5DN1L: Glad the issue was solved :P
 5DN1L: agreed
 StraumliPerversion: nruffier, was it in groovy?
 5DN1L: yes, he said so
 StraumliPerversion: ah, that times out randomly
 StraumliPerversion: if you don't use CompileStatic

 snitchesGetStitches: rats are quite exquisite indeed
 5DN1L: i'm ready to kick out anyone who continues with non-coding related topics
 jacek: kotlin, groovy... is it that jvm languages are affected with timeouts?
 jacek: except java
 struct: yes
 struct: they used to have a compiler for kotlin that was made by jetbrains
 eulerscheZahl: what about scala, clojure?
 struct: But I dont think its used
 eulerscheZahl: that specific compiler is outdated now, not using new language features
 struct: so is java 8
 eulerscheZahl: they tried java 11 (?) at some point and rolled back
 struct: yes
 struct: was during a contest
 struct:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: today someone invited me to a meeting from 4:30-5pm. already an inconvenience for me (usually i leave at 3pm). and then he didn't even show up :rage:
 jacek: CG staff meeting?
 VizGhar: mg... invite them for call at 7am and don't show up next time&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: unfortunately i'm the one who needs their help
 VizGhar: heh... too bad
 eulerscheZahl: hosting a website inside a bigger company isn't that trivial
 b0n5a1: Keep calm eulerscheZahl ... tomorrow just gives him a nice cake (with laxative) :D
 eulerscheZahl: not because of the coding, but paperwork
 eulerscheZahl: he's not even in the same country as I am
 b0n5a1: erf
 eulerscheZahl: also: optim contests starts in a bit over 2 days.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/asprocon8">https://atcoder.jp/contests/asprocon8</a>
 eulerscheZahl: typo, it's just 1 contest
 struct: maybe ill try
 struct: never joined an atcoder contest
 eulerscheZahl: i tried one of their 6h optims. did poorly
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/ahc004/standings?watching=eulerscheZahl">https://atcoder.jp/contests/ahc004/standings?watching=eulerscheZahl</a>
 eulerscheZahl: just now i realized that contest was rated
 struct: isnt kotlin heroes soon too?
 struct: oh its over
 eulerscheZahl: was supposed to be on tuesday
 struct: ah postponed
 eulerscheZahl: cancelled because of Ukraine war
 eulerscheZahl: "Given the current circumstances, we have decided to postpone Kotlin Heroes until further notice. Thank you for your understanding."
 VizGhar: Ah... JetBrains are russians... makes sense 
 VizGhar: if thats organised by them... i don't know the contest
 eulerscheZahl: the codeforces admin publicly wrote against war. i wonder if he risks repercussions that way
 struct: is he russian?
 eulerscheZahl: and yes: jetbrains pays some money prizes + 100 tshirts for kotlin heroes
 eulerscheZahl: yes, codeforces is russian. so is the admin

 jacek: i thought jetbrains was czech? oO
 Nat-42: According to Wikipedia the founders were 3 russians living in Prague, so it's both?
 Ho-Sook: Guys, the puzzles here are advanced right?
 5DN1L: There are different difficulty levels

 Ho-Sook: but when it says level easy, I found that is actually advanced level
 5DN1L: If you haven't learned any programming languages before, you'd better go to another website to learn it first
 Ho-Sook: which sites do you recommend me?
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codecademy.com">https://www.codecademy.com</a>
 jacek: puzzles in easy can vary
 jacek: the easiest are the descent, temperatures, power of thor, horse racing

 darkhorse64: It seems that someone did not like my posts on Discord. Banned and latest posts deleted
 darkhorse64: without notice
 VizGhar: you got political darkhorse64?&#160;:)
 struct: what happened darkhorse64?
 darkhorse64: I asked CG to act about anti squid cam links
 darkhorse64: publicly
 VizGhar: (not sure what cam links are, so ill wait for further discussion)
 struct: I unbaned you darkhorse64
 Astrobytes: who did it struct? PM me
 darkhorse64: "I get by with a little help from my friends" :heart_eyes:
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: VizGhar: *scam links :D
 VizGhar: ah. makes more sense :D thanls
 VizGhar: I'm a little bit scared of cam links of any programmer :D
 VizGhar: scarry stuff
 darkhorse64: I am back. Yes scam. Cam links are always suspicious. Damn fingers
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Liztec: e
 StraumliPerversion: deleted messages... what a barbaric system
 KANDO: wtf
 MrBlack38: :joy:
 KANDO: how can we start
 UZUHAMA: Hello world
 Astrobytes: Any updates on chat removal?
 ASM_MOV_INT: why would they do that? i've learned so much from world chat on here....
 ASM_MOV_INT: or is the lack of moderators the reason?
 Astrobytes: There are enough moderators, it's a resources issue from the parent company afaik
 Astrobytes: old outdated chat system, not enough resources or manpower to update
 Astrobytes: well, on a return on investment basis I mean
 ASM_MOV_INT: make it a challenge for the community, it's only a hub for.... a huge programming community
 ASM_MOV_INT: lol
 Astrobytes: Tried that years ago
 Astrobytes: We got the SDK at least, that's to be thankful for. Open sourcing other parts of CG weren't really in their business model. Which is fair enough
 Astrobytes: *wasn't
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I dislike Discord, so I dislike removing this chat.  However, turning it on/off or letting it idle disconnect with sessionIDs instead of keep-alive would probably solve issues.
 Astrobytes: It's past that point now PatrickMcGinnisII, I do hope you'll still be around on there though at least
 Astrobytes: Discord I mean
 Astrobytes: Will be a real damn shame to lose so many people from here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Discord likes stuff I don't like running all the time
 Astrobytes: even the browser version? I never used the app/exe
 PatrickMcGinnisII: And it influences people to move to chrome, which I actually abhor
 Astrobytes: I use it from FF when I'm on my linux box
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well Waterfox has the best web dev extensions imo, stuff on FB,YT,CG, etc. has already started to stop working on Waterfox... so forced to use FF.  I may try discord with Brave
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's like a slow push for everything to use chrome which is againt my beliefs in open-source dev
 Astrobytes: I have had zero issues with discord. It's back to the Just don't click on anything you don't want to style, which I like.
 Astrobytes: Fair argument regarding Chrome but I donno, you got a discord alternative?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well I uninstalled the APP, It doesn't get to eat resources.  Hell, I whack software updaters and cloud storage extensions from task manager everytime I boot...so I'm a little picky
 Astrobytes: Understood. The browser only version doesn't do anything to the startup tasks
 Astrobytes: (I also kill most of those btw)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a few groups I'm on discord in, but switching back and forth isn't fun for me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'd rather run mIRC
 PatrickMcGinnisII: is there a #Codeingame on IRC?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's the biggest pain. Kinda why I've been off CG for a bit amongst other reasons
 Astrobytes: No idea tbh, been a while since I did any mIRCing
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm, well CG is a mash of things ... the chat has security issues i think, so the fact it's still here now is probably from painstaking work
 Astrobytes: It's still here by way of neglect and unwillingness to invest in fixing it. At this point, firefighting it is more wasteful than nuking it
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII nods</b></p><p><img src="/a/75707267075165" /> PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm here for the IDE anyways, it gives better info than adding try {} catch exception to every script
 Astrobytes: hahaha fair
 Astrobytes: Doesn't using VSCode with the appropriate plugin amount to the same?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Funny thing, I write ALOT of php in Notepad++ and use command line.  C++/Java is different (of course), but when I do those I'm dedicated to it.  I run alot of image processing for my laser work on same computer...So I can pop in CG for some downtime w/o the overhead *shrug*
 Astrobytes: again, totally fair, not judging 
 Astrobytes: and this Monaco-based IDE is light-years better than the old one, at least imo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: php has some built in image stuff (although slow) that doesn't require plugins and libs that I can quickly automate, skipping a few steps ... compilation, window builds,etc.
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: why this is wrong in death first search ep-1

 PatrickMcGinnisII: we are all born dying
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: Um, because 12 is not a node maybe?
 XueHuaPiaoPiao: ok ill try
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the new ide, it's a little quick to popup mouseovers... the coloring is nice tho
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i forgot how to turn off suggestions
 Astrobytes: It's literally the VSCode editor, Monaco. It does have quirks
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oic, thought u were referring to VC b4
 Astrobytes: The suggestions and mouseovers are annoying
 PatrickMcGinnisII: needs a select all on right click too
 Astrobytes: I haven't looked into all the customisations to even know if that's possible
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's alot I don't use
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gonna cook dinner and code, keep it real mr. :taco: Astrobytes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: awe westicles isn't here lol

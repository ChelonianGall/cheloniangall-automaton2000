 Waffle3z: clash of code is an event now?
 Mohamed_Kharrat: PatrickMcGinnisII  thanks man, although I did end up solving it with recursion just like knapsack, I used a dictionary
 Mohamed_Kharrat: turned out easier than i thought
 PatrickMcGinnisII: of course u did. :clap:
 Mohamed_Kharrat: :D
 PatAPizza56: how do we invite redninja???
 Mohamed_Kharrat: i invited both of u 
 Mohamed_Kharrat: 30 sec left
 Mohamed_Kharrat: tick
 Mohamed_Kharrat: tock
 Mohamed_Kharrat: have to go get some sleep bye guys
 Andy12: HEY.
 Andy12: hi
 RandomSteve: hello there
 Redninja106: WHATS UP EVERYONE
 RandomSteve: not much, how you doing?
 RandomSteve: I'm working on the temperatures puzzle
 Redninja106: well thanks!
 Redninja106: im in COC right now!
 RandomSteve: cool
 RandomSteve: yay I solved it
 RandomSteve:&#160;:)
 RandomSteve: I kinda have a trauma becaus ein the puzzle shadows of the knight everytime I tought I had it I didn't have it but this time it actually worked
 RandomSteve: now I actually feel like I am learning and taht I have learned a lot
 RandomSteve: thanks to all those people that showed me support
 PatAPizza56: hey everyone!

 jacek: oh my <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent">https://www.deepmind.com/publications/a-generalist-agent</a>
 DomiKo: published 2 days ago?
 jacek: 12 may
 DomiKo: ohh ok I see
 MSmits: hey, I just had a really good idea about my local meta mcts
 MSmits: I switched to a normal mcts (with book lookups) for my local and it only did 200-300 rollouts/second because it has to take the data from the drive
 MSmits: So I made a shadow-dictionary that caches all the data on the drive that is being used with a capacity of around 1M. I do everything from that cache and flush it when it reaches 1M. It sped my program up a factor of 10!
 jacek: now do it in GPU
 MSmits: no way :P
 jacek: i finally hunted down the bug, but i still dont know why it happens in the first place
 MSmits: weren't you at that place already or is this a different bug?
 jacek: i was, but it reappeared when i added another car
 jacek: i learned some of the gdb
 jacek: i assumed it was some null pointer
 MSmits: oh ok
 jacek: but it isnt, the pointer points to some deleted object
 MSmits: weird
 jacek: but i dont see at code why it would happen
 jacek: and it still happens once in few hours
 jacek: i was lucky i caught that while in gdb
 jacek: $57 = {&lt;Point&gt; = {x = -1.0228604160514661e+263, y = 479.0564462702327}, _vptr.Unit = 0x7fffdc000, id = 0, vx = 132, vy = 100, beforeColvx = 132, beforeColvy = 100, radius = 100, mass = 1, friction = 0}
 jacek: nice x
 MSmits: oh yeah
 MSmits: I think i know what happened
 MSmits: the car went to a different universe with the same y coordinate
 MSmits: but same x
 MSmits: different x that is
 MSmits: there's a wormhole in your code
 eulerscheZahl: would be cool if you can somehow apply that concept in the real world
 MSmits: Like pointing to something that doesn't exist and then you're teleported to a different universe?
 MSmits: That's be fun
 MSmits: 'd
 RivalRickson: hi
 rabee12: hi
 jacek: finally i found it!
 jacek: it was pointing to the beginning of vector. but if you add something to the vector, it will resize and copy and the address will be invalid
 jacek: stupid c++ and its memory management
 DaNinja: that auto resize can be extremely annoying. it breaks references as well as pointers
 MSmits: ohh that is indeed annoying. I haven't had this problem because I use vectors as a cache with a large capacity at the start
 MSmits: good to know that this can happen
 Teerach: heloooooooooooooooooo
 Teerach: helloooooooooooooo*
 ben517: do private clash of code games affect your rank
 bojgus: no
 ben517: cool thanks
 therealbeef: it's basic property of std::vector interface&#160;:-/
 struct: jacek does that happen only if the vector gets empty and then add something?
 therealbeef: "If the new size() is greater than capacity() then all iterators and references (including the past-the-end iterator) are invalidated. Otherwise only the past-the-end iterator is invalidated."
 struct: so if I had vector&lt;int&gt; vec(1);int* p = &amp;vec[0];and then add more than 1 int, it will cause problems?
 therealbeef: depends if capacity is also 1
 struct: isnt vec(n) the capacity?
 struct: or is it something else?
 therealbeef: n is the size
 TINOUAINANI: Top 50 or delete :grin:
 TINOUAINANI: :joy:
 therealbeef: capacity is the size of the reserved memory
 struct: vector&lt;int&gt; vec(1);cout &lt;&lt; vec.capacity() &lt;&lt; endl;vector&lt;int&gt; vec2(2);cout &lt;&lt; vec2.capacity() &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: 12
 therealbeef: most implementations apparently set the initial capacity to the initial size, but the standard doesn't specify anything
 struct: ah ok
 struct: thanks for explaining
 therealbeef: a high-performance implementation could use a small initial stack array for example
 jacek: struct it happened when i added 3rd ball to vector of capacity of 2
 jacek: i never knew there could be 3 balls during collisions handling
 jacek: this is what you get when copying code straight from java
 TINOUAINANI: Ho did puzzel named "Bank Robbers" , i am stack in last test with slite differnece in the resulte&#160;?
 5DN1L: Probably because your solution is wrong?
 TINOUAINANI: my be not , may be i lose some peregent becouse the resule is so close
 jacek: oO
 5DN1L: btw what language are you using? is that English? TINOUAINANI
 TINOUAINANI: :joy:
 TINOUAINANI: i am lezy to use tradiction sory hhh
 jacek: :thinking:
 5DN1L: that's a language puzzle
 TINOUAINANI: Q&#160;: if you whant to find number of combination of password thats 3 first characters are digit and the last tow are from [a,b,c,d]&#160;?
 TINOUAINANI: the result is pow(10,3)*pow(4,2) wright&#160;?
 5DN1L: it took me a few seconds to interpret tow as two...
 5DN1L: wright
 5DN1L: i mean, right
 TINOUAINANI: no percegent lose right&#160;?
 5DN1L: sorry, no idea about what you're asking
 5DN1L: translate it for me
 5DN1L: thank you
 jacek: hm?
 emyilmaz: holaaa
 Husoski: TINOUAINANI That's correct, provided that repeated characters are allowed.
 Husoski: With no repetitions, its C(10,3)*C(4,2)
 Darleanow: Hello gello
 Darleanow: 5DN1L
 Darleanow: i need u bro
 TINOUAINANI: ok thanks
 Darleanow: i'm doing 1d fire bushes
 Darleanow: i've made a regex 
 Darleanow: to split by 3 all the bushes and its working, almost
 5DN1L: Don't ask me about regex :scream:
 Darleanow: for some the quantity of bushes isnt dividable by 3 xD
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-bush-fire">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/1d-bush-fire</a>
 Darleanow: U SHOULD LEARN AT LEAST THE BASICS&#160;!!
 5DN1L: :cry:
 zakacat: Give :taco: 5DN1L
 Ayza: still suffering darlean lol
 5DN1L: what is the logic of your code, Darleanow?
 Tien118: taco?
 Husoski: Darelanow This is a simple loop to write without regex.  WIth regex you have the problem of a fire in a final string of length 1 or 2.
 Ayza: someone did solve this puzzle with one line of regex
 Ayza: but it's not necessary 
 Husoski: Sounds like someone has a golf complex.
 Darleanow: Hello Ayza and Husoki&#160;!!
 Darleanow: idk what you're talking about --'
 Darleanow: 5DN1L it searches for f's in strings cutted in 3
 Darleanow: but i just need to know like when u split a string
 Darleanow: if like it has not a length of 3, how can i get the last part of this string
 Husoski: I have an idea to try in the IDE...brb
 Ayza: I didn't split the string for my solution
 5DN1L: that regex solutions checks for end of word boundary
 5DN1L: solution*
 Ayza: didn't seem to work out easily
 5DN1L: or rather, end of line boundary i think
 zakacat: Is there a way that I can do only fastest claseh?
 Darleanow: mmmh
 zakacat: *clashes
 5DN1L: Join clash event or do a private clash
 zakacat: nice, thanks
 Husoski: Okay, regex is pretty easy but probably wasteful, CPU-wise.  The leftmost fire must be put out, no matter what, right?  Think about what happens after that.
 5DN1L: np&#160;:)
 zakacat: Oh, I got it apparently anyways. whoop whoop 
 Darleanow: Husoki i didnt understood everything
 Darleanow: like leftmost etc
 Gedela: taco
 jacek: :upside_down:
 jacek: Automaton2000 where is he?
 Automaton2000: yeah but it's not the case
 jacek: round and round <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://streamable.com/op6fsl">https://streamable.com/op6fsl</a>
 TINOUAINANI: new puzzel "Calculator"
 struct: now all you need is to avx the sim
 ChrisKoehlerjr: can anyone help me with some puzzles
 VirtualRealityRocks: I code C# too ChrisKoehlerjr , what do you need?
 isaadi: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 isaadi: mfw C
 isaadi: pointers
 TINOUAINANI: hhhhh pointres are great :joy:
 TINOUAINANI: 1/a = 1/x1 + 1/x2
 TINOUAINANI: is there a formola that faind all x1 and x2 that that fitting this eqution&#160;???
 TINOUAINANI: ps&#160;: x1 and x2 are unknown
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f70e8513-9df6-4955-8e25-87c5643ccea7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f70e8513-9df6-4955-8e25-87c5643ccea7</a>
 j4at: Didn't test it, but even if i made a mistake the idea is there
 j4at: TINOUAINANI
 jacek: assuming x1, x2&#160;!= 0
 j4at: well in our case its&#160;!=0 :3
 j4at: Didn't bother write the prove
 j4at: proof*
 j4at: (forgot to remove x1=x2=0)
 j4at: and a=[] lol
 TINOUAINANI: i test your programme is,s working but what if x1 and x2 are great than a&#160;?
 TINOUAINANI: for ex your program
 TINOUAINANI: 1/2 = 1/1 - 1/2
 TINOUAINANI: but i whant those&#160;?
 TINOUAINANI: 1/2 = 1/6 + 1/31/2 = 1/4 + 1/4
 TINOUAINANI: ist apuzzel named "Unit Fractions" that till this
 j4at: ops made a mistake
 TINOUAINANI: thi problem that they rich number big us 999999999 so thir is some thing with out for loop with i++
 j4at: Well you can break if x2&gt;2
 j4at: incase of positive x1 and x2
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0078f6c3-00aa-40be-9a91-a5465cce94ac">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0078f6c3-00aa-40be-9a91-a5465cce94ac</a>
 j4at: Didn't test it again
 j4at: This works if x1&gt;0
 j4at: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8a68c74a-2d2b-4ec7-9819-9a91dc9b41cc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8a68c74a-2d2b-4ec7-9819-9a91dc9b41cc</a>
 j4at: if a &gt; 0 then a small change will make it work on all cases
 j4at: I helped enough you can guess the reset alone
 j4at: TINOUAINANI 
 TINOUAINANI: thi big problem is in +1 every time you will get time out , thanks for your time
 j4at: yeah it should be x2&lt;2 lol
 j4at: TINOUAINANI 
 j4at: nvm its correct :3
 j4at: THis is what happens when you don't test&#160;:
 jacek: oO
 TKirishima: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: this time i did it
 TKirishima: Nice
 aissvm: Nice
 Remi.: Automaton2000&#160;: turtle or not turtle&#160;? that is the question
 Automaton2000: i need to change the value
 4kTre0912: Hola
 Darleanow: j4at u online&#160;?:)
 waterproofsodium: i lost 2 CP :O
 waterproofsodium: 2!!
 waterproofsodium: that's 1 more than 1
 mdfarhansadiq: hi
 mdfarhansadiq: :grin:
 waterproofsodium: hi
 waterproofsodium: "sadiq"
 waterproofsodium: I knew that was either indian or pakistan
 mdfarhansadiq: Bangladesh
 mdfarhansadiq: :D
 waterproofsodium: oh bangladesh is its own
 waterproofsodium: ignorant me
 mdfarhansadiq: oh...no problem
 waterproofsodium: is it still like
 waterproofsodium: 50 degrees celsius there?
 waterproofsodium: "in that region"
 mdfarhansadiq: no...now it's 30 degrees
 waterproofsodium: oh wow "lucky you"
 mdfarhansadiq: :D
 waterproofsodium: but it was like 40, wasn't it?
 mdfarhansadiq: yeah...kind of...but it's like 27
 mdfarhansadiq: now
 waterproofsodium: feels like too early in the year
 waterproofsodium: here it's already 30
 mdfarhansadiq: o
 waterproofsodium: but if we're lucky we stay below 35 most of the time
 mdfarhansadiq: wow
 waterproofsodium: anyways it gets crazy
 waterproofsodium: once you go above body temperature sweating does no more help the body
 mdfarhansadiq: exactly
 waterproofsodium: I wish we wouldn't depend on "climate change just playing out" as we currently do lol
 mdfarhansadiq: hahaha
 mdfarhansadiq: sounds interesting
 mdfarhansadiq: what's your real name?
 mdfarhansadiq: :grin:
 waterproofsodium: but what can you expect in an age where it's still ok for countries to attack other countries to acquire territory
 waterproofsodium: oh I don't say my real name in here sorry
 mdfarhansadiq: it's ok
 mdfarhansadiq: i think if a matter can be solved by discussion then why do war
 waterproofsodium: in this situation because the psychological disorders some people have can't be solved by discussion :p
 mdfarhansadiq: yeah...maybe
 mdfarhansadiq: we need a world where people are friendly and live peacefully
 mdfarhansadiq: there is no arrogance, ego, hatred, fight
 mdfarhansadiq: :relaxed:
 weptdog: Im completely new to coding where should I start??
 mdfarhansadiq: i think you can start from practice
 mdfarhansadiq: by using practice option
 mdfarhansadiq: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training">https://www.codingame.com/training</a>
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Welcome weptdog... careful, its addictive. :wink:
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Question for anyone: Why does the Clash of Code get referred to as "5 minute coding battles" but they really are 15 minutes&#160;??
 Ayza: probably because you are supposed to solve it in 5 minutes or so
 waterproofsodium: Lisa-Has-Ideas
 waterproofsodium: marketing
 RandomSteve: it should theorically be posible to solve them in 5 minutes
 RandomSteve: but you are given 15 to solve them
 RandomSteve: but yes, it is a 15 minute battle
 waterproofsodium: it's theoretically possible to solve each and everyone of them in &lt; 1 min ig
 RandomSteve: I highly doubt that
 RandomSteve: some are very hard
 waterproofsodium: i mean
 waterproofsodium: "theoretically possible"
 waterproofsodium: just taking you by your words
 RandomSteve: All right my phrase was a bit open for interpretation but you know what I mean
 waterproofsodium: a reasonable constraint for a theoretical limit might be typing speed of the world champion
 RandomSteve: true
 waterproofsodium: meaning you could theoretically solve most of them in 20 sec&#160;;)
 RandomSteve: a lot of them are solvable in that amount of time yes
 waterproofsodium: I would go by what a experienced clasher does
 waterproofsodium: and yeah most of them may be even solvable in 3 min
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: ha, okay
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: ha, okay
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: ha, okay
 RandomSteve: xd
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: ha, okay
 RandomSteve: all right you might wanna stop doing that I mean a mod might get mad
 waterproofsodium: once is an accident
 waterproofsodium: maybe 2
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Sorry... it was my computer.  I thought it wasn't taking it.  (Sorry)
 waterproofsodium: three?
 waterproofsodium: no that's a pattern :P
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Yeah, I'm dumb 
 waterproofsodium: (fav movie quote)
 RandomSteve: I'm sure you're very smart Lisa
 waterproofsodium: finding out it's not a movie quote
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: (I didn't see all these wonderful responses to my question earlier either.  Thank Ya!!)
 RandomSteve: my pleasure
 RandomSteve: No, I am your father
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: It varies depending on what movie I just watched, but this is a good one: “This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow”
 RandomSteve: yeah that is a nice one
 briankings: I have no idea what im doing
 xiaoping: share code
 xiaoping: i want to see
 RandomSteve: me too
 RandomSteve: How am I top 5% in this website if I started programming about two months ago? do 95% of people quit after two months?
 RandomSteve: actually top 4% now!
 LeJordy: maybe you just do it more often
 RandomSteve: I guess it's something like that
 RandomSteve: I am really happy with the progress I am making so far

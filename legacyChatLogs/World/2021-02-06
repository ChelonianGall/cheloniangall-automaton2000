 kaz-png: finally, Caturday
 Ajay-Bisht.7017.: hii
 jacek: so quiet in this Caturday
 kovi: hello.oh, you resubmitted from 2nd?
 jacek: new model
 kovi: im thinking of adding duplication check
 jacek: transpositions?
 kovi: oh, so that is how it is called
 jacek: you didnt know? :o
 kovi: i am new to these
 kovi: i was thinking graph manipulation
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Transposition_Table</a>
 jacek: though i never got it working for mcts. i use TT only for minimax-like
 jacek: i can consistenly win against robo, but still only single games against reCurse
 kovi: yeah, that is godly
 kovi: gratz for 2nd though
 kovi: duplication is easier with minimax cause you eval at the same turn
 kovi: uttt is mostly nonduplicate cause of forced moves
 jacek: in mcts there is also issue how to backpropagate that and UCT selection
 kovi: even though it is "flow" like
 kovi: non-reversible
 kovi: bt is also nonreversible...and simple (single piece type)
 jacek: yeah, no cycles
 kovi: probably lots of duplications. and no difference how to get there
 _O-MEGA: can anyone pls help me with a dp problem, i can't find the solution&#160;;-;
 _O-MEGA: it's for sure an easy one but...
 _O-MEGA: please?
 jacek: whats the problem
 _O-MEGA: so given an array with positive intgers, u are allowed to change any element to another element with a cost of their sum, u need to find the minimum cost such that the array is nondecreasing
 _O-MEGA: like if u have: 4 2 3 1 the minimum cost is 9
 _O-MEGA: u change the first element into 1 and the last element into 3
 _O-MEGA: is the problem clear?
 jacek: too geeky for me
 jacek: have you searched geeksforgeeks.org?
 _O-MEGA: yes 
 _O-MEGA: not a lot but didnt find anything
 Omer_ctr: 90% python answers
 _O-MEGA: wdym?
 _O-MEGA: Jacek got any idea?
 jacek: nah
 _O-MEGA: rip
 _O-MEGA: anyone else?
 jacek: try discord
 _O-MEGA: ok
 _O-MEGA: true

 TBali: Freecell puzzle: "Community success rate: 0%"3 approvers: you are caught red-handed...
 jacek: maybe they solved during approval and forgot about it later
 TBali: yeah, very likely

 uri1love: join*
 TBali: There is a channel for this, no?
 jacek: oO
 3ataja: TBali, where? on Discord?
 jacek: on Celestia
 AntiSquid: uri1love <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/paper-soccer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/paper-soccer</a> join fast! gogogo&#160;! NOW!
 MSmits: before I discovered paper soccer, my life was empty and hollow. Now I feel revived and energized. Try paper soccer today, free!
 reCurse: How much did you get paid?
 reCurse: For the right price I might join too
 MSmits: I am not at liberty to disclose :P
 reCurse: Shame
 darkhorse64: Play fireworks and enlight your nights
 kovi: i heard that euler pay double for tryangle
 MSmits: ohh
 jacek: even ceg survived paper soccer
 jacek: and he doesnt even read statements
 struct: after he did paper soccer he was never seen again
 struct: keep that in mind
 jacek: he pruned himself away
 kovi: talking about disappears, what is with dbdr?
 struct: He was here 1 week ago+-
 jacek: AutomatonNN where is that other guy?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to do that in the referee to add a replay of the community puzzle
 jacek: yeah, where he is oO
 s464913: hi I have a little problem. I defeated the boss but I'm still in bronze. And I dont know what to do ;d
 struct: Are you above the boss?
 jacek: you need to be above the boss in leaderboard
 s464913: yeah
 jacek: if your submit is over, wait for next promotion window
 s464913: im above
 jacek: and? you promoted?
 s464913: no ;d
 s464913: but is says that: Those better than the Boss will be promoted to Silver League at 18 H 17
 s464913: So I guess that I must wait
 jacek: eeyup
 s464913: but idk what time zone it is
 jacek: just 5 more minutes
 s464913: u are from Poland?
 jacek: yes :scream:
 s464913: zaczalem w to grac niedawno wiec nizebyt jeszcze ogarniam zasady XD
 jacek: coders strike back?
 s464913: ta
 kovi: jacek you "packed" the 6-10 group
 Papaver: I am also trying Coders strike back. Sometimes it doesn't show any pods moving in the game window when I press Play, although the console returns normal outputs. It works again if I refresh, but it's kind of annoying&#160;;) Do I overlook something?
 kovi: can a browser restart solve it?
 jacek: packed?
 kovi: 2x37.51,3x37.49
 jacek: compression eh
 Wontonimo: please give me some feedback on my clash-of-code contribution "Code Breaker" <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/615955355e81da150427fbc22030665ef811">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/615955355e81da150427fbc22030665ef811</a> it has received several downvotes and but no actual feedback.
 Wontonimo: is it too difficult, too easy, poorly described ...&#160;??  The basic concept break a ceaser cipher.  Computationally simple, but it is clash-of-code 
 Uljahn: it's simple when you're familiar with cryptography
 Westicles: There are already at least 6 other Caesar cipher clashes, that might be part of the problem
 jacek: do the double rot13 puzzle
 kovi: play of bandas is quite complex, i dont like it
 jacek: oO
 kovi: also no debug msg...what kind of playout count can i expect?
 jacek: pure mcts? ask MSmits
 kovi: you play jacekmax?
 jacek: yes. NN of course
 MSmits: not sure kovi, i use an endgame book for bandas
 kovi: i c
 jacek: he's like bible, alpha and omega
 MSmits: my random rollouts cut short pretty early
 MSmits: well just omega for bandas, no alpha
 kovi:&#160;:)
 kovi: no opening because it is random
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: btw, if you're looking to generate endgame book for bandas, max size is 12 (so 3x4 or 4x3, 6x2 etc)
 MSmits: and you can only generate it offline, then put it in codesize
 MSmits: bigger endgame books wont fit and it is quite expensive to generate them
 jacek: how often 6x2 occurs eh
 MSmits: dunno
 MSmits: didnt matter to me anyhow
 MSmits: for oware you would generate it in the first 1 second
 MSmits: because you can get bigger books that way, than when putting it in codesize
 MSmits: it's all about computing vs memory
 MSmits: well code size instead of memory, in this case
 MSmits: anyway, gtg, promised my wife to watch a quiz thing on tv , ttyl
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://oeis.org/A212693">https://oeis.org/A212693</a> - good idea for reverse clash
 MSmits: so, you would look at the numbers, then write a program to calculate these numbers?
 MSmits: in 15 mins
 MSmits: I don't see a problem with that
 tiabeanie: hello
 DJSchaffner: is there something in java by default which is like a signum function in other languages? copysign only returns + and - but not exactly zero
 DJSchaffner: or do you have to code it yourself everytime?
 DJSchaffner: whoops
 DJSchaffner: in python by default*
 3ataja: bots shouldn't be allowed around this hour in CoC&#160;:)
 [K]Gabor: is the platform dying just for me?
 3ataja: it's dies every day around this hour
 [K]Gabor: oh&#160;:( i see
 [K]Gabor: its time to sleep than
 ZQWhiting: Any idea when the site usually resolves its issues?
 3ataja: i don't think it takes too long
 3ataja: may be all right in half an hour
 ZQWhiting: Thanks
 brand: hey how is everyone doing t
 Mr.Woof: yo

 MSmits: Marchete are you there?
 MSmits: I found another example where you can see mikla does not even finish endgames properly and here he loses because of it:
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/569610594">https://www.codingame.com/replay/569610594</a>
 MSmits: (frame 97)
 MSmits: he should have just taken all 4 boxes and he would have won 24-25, instead he gives them all to me as he is just using a heuristic to play endgames
 MSmits: it almost never matters because control almost always gives you the win, except in close games like this
 MSmits: my bot does not adjust it's expected score to 25-24 because it only does so after a search and my bot didn't need one
 opitt: Do you know if/where coc puzzles are stored? I want to redo my code but forgot the test cases …
 MSmits: you can view them in contributions if you have done enough clashes
 MSmits: not sure how many you need
 punter147: MSmits what do you use for solving dots and boxes?
 punter147: mcts?
 MSmits: negamax
 MSmits: mcts is good for solving in general, but I don't think it would work very well here
 MSmits: you need transpositions
 MSmits: ab pruning + TT still makes my head hurt
 MSmits: I generally just mess around with it until a 100 million sample produces no errors
 punter147: oh i see. transpositions is like a dynamic programming approach, in which you dont calculate the answer to already seen state again and again...
 MSmits: yeah, which is easy without ab pruning
 MSmits: but ab pruning makes it so that you dont finish the exact calculation but still want to store the result
 MSmits: so you use upper and lower limits in the TT
 MSmits: which is where my head starts to hurt
 punter147: lol if your head would hurt, a lot of things will hurt on my side :joy: . Just kidding, thanks for the tip MSmits i will start studying ab pruning and transposition tables.
 MSmits: D&amp;B makes it even weirder because the same board can occur from player 1 and from player 2's perspective
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf">https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/theses/Carolus.pdf</a>
 MSmits: best source for ab + TT
 MSmits: it has good pseudo code
 MSmits: i adapted it for D&amp;B though, because of the symmetry I just mentioned
 punter147: aah yes D&amp;B does not distinguish among the lines right, unlike chess positions which are distinguished by the color and the rank of the piece...
 MSmits: exactly, and not just that, but because you can have multiple lines in 1 turn because of what you choose to do, the same board can occur at turn 56 or at turn 58 and such
 MSmits: mmh not sure i said that correctly
 MSmits: I should say, it could be player 1's turn or player 2's turn at the same frame and board, depending on what happened before
 MSmits: because you get another play if you're the one finishing a box
 MSmits: and sometimes you can finish 2 boxes at the same time but get only 1 extra turn, which switches the parity
 punter147: yes you are right MSmits, i was just looking at D&amp;B plays, once you finish a box, you get another chance, again if you make another box, another chance and the party continues...
 MSmits: exactly, it's quite messy to code a bot for but mathematically really interesting
 MSmits: if you want to practice negamax and such, dont do it here really
 MSmits: i mean not in D&amp;B
 Marchete: are you using minimax?
 MSmits: negamax yes, same thing i guess
 MSmits: with ab/tt
 punter147: MSmits oh, are there any games simple enough to get our feet wet in negamax? 
 MSmits: pre-end game a move is a line, in the end game, a move is offering a full string/chain or when offered, it's the choice between doubledealing or not
 MSmits: punter147 yes many
 MSmits: find a simple board game you know you can simulate properly
 MSmits: not sure which is easiest, people tend to go for ultimate tic tac toe even though mcts works better there
 Marchete: I mean not MCTS
 MSmits: nope not mcts
 MSmits: TT is extremely strong here because of the colorless board
 MSmits: using TT with mcts is not very effective most of the time
 Marchete: do you think he just randomly put lines until a certain moment?
 MSmits: I think he has a chaincounting negamax running until he solves the chaincount result
 MSmits: and if he doesnt solve, he randoms
 Marchete: so no avoiding complex chains?
 Marchete: or loops or whatever
 MSmits: I don't think so. Avoiding them doesn't really help either player specifically. It just makes the game easier to solve
 MSmits: but that goes for both sides
 MSmits: I have been considering doing a complexity mcts
 MSmits: where i try to get the most complex connection of short chains and such in the end game
 MSmits: so that mikla cant deal with it&#160;:)
 MSmits: it would lead to funny endgames i think, but its a lot of work
 MSmits: I am trying to get those sacrifices into my solver now
 MSmits: hard to detect them without building a graph
 MSmits: i think it can be done with bitboards but not easily
 Marchete: early game give bonus for number of chains
 Marchete: or whatever target the enemy can't deal
 Marchete: I'd say daisy chains are hard
 Marchete: or whatever it was called
 Marchete: 3-way loop + ground chain
 MSmits: well that makes sense, but it's not the current number of chains that matter, it's the amount at the end of the game
 MSmits: so if you have half finished structures and empty spaces, you're not gonna know how many chains are gonna be there
 Marchete: if you play with that target
 Marchete: more than with pure random
 MSmits: you can do mcts and randomly rollout until the end game happens, then analyze
 MSmits: but thats what i was planning to do already&#160;:)
 MSmits: except with negamax
 MSmits: but i might do it with mcts later. I just don't think it'll be better
 MSmits: the problem is that there is no neat progression from a "bad state" to a "good state" by several good moves
 MSmits: they are separated by 1 wrong line
 MSmits: so my sense is that you need a full solve to make any prediction
 MSmits: in games like chess and such you can make your boardstate progressively better or worse with good or bad moves. That's just not the case here
 MSmits: it's a coin you can flip between loss and win, except you have no idea which way it is facing before you flip. So it becomes in effect a totally random coin flip
 MSmits: I suppose mcts might still give *some*  improvement if you pick moves that are more likely to lead to a beneficial flip
 Marchete: I was thinking like I said
 Marchete: trying to have better patters (like chain types and similar)
 Marchete: and try to reach them
 Marchete: but as you say
 Marchete: going from win to loss is really near
 Marchete: but I still think
 Marchete: if enemies can't handle daisy chains easily
 Marchete: it will be harder for them to solve
 MSmits: i dont think you should call them daisy chains
 Marchete: I can't remember its name
 MSmits: no, thats fine, but you'll get jacek all excited with that term :P
 jacek: shackles
 Marchete: :D
 MSmits: dont you just mean loops?
 Marchete: I mean a loop
 MSmits: ah ok
 Marchete: with a ground chain attached
 Marchete: like a flower
 MSmits: oh that's called a dipper in literature
 Marchete: ahh
 MSmits: you always capture the attached chain first
 MSmits: then it becomes a loop
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: doesnt have to be grounded either
 MSmits: the string can be connected to something else
 MSmits: it will still be better to do the string before the loop
 MSmits: there's a lot of little rules like that that makes the solving faster if you put them in
 Marchete: but you need to detect it
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: if (joins[0] == joins[1])	{		if (joins[0]-&gt;ActiveLinks() == 3)			return false;
 MSmits: joins[0] == joins[1] finds a string that is connected to the same join ( a loop)
 MSmits: if the join happens to have exactly 3 strings connected, then it's a dipper
 MSmits: so i disallow the doubly connected string to be played in that case
 swapbee: hello
 Marchete: but all the 3-way chains are hard to evaluate, and maybe promoting it in the eval is positive
 Marchete: as the enemy will have a harder time to eval
 MSmits: they are hard to solve yes
 MSmits: but anything like that will hurt both sides
 MSmits: so this only works if you know you are especially good at dealing with it
 Marchete: one will be hurt harder
 MSmits: and everyone else isnt
 Marchete: exactly
 MSmits: it's a good point
 Marchete: anyways everyone else seems to mean 1 guy
 Marchete: maybe 2 when I tackle the game
 MSmits: in this case yeah, he's the only one doing the chain counting efficiently
 MSmits: though some other guys seem to make sacrifices really short before the end game (2-3 plays) where he does them 15 plays before the end game
 MSmits: my leaderboard version also makes sacrifices really short before the end game
 MSmits: thats why i am 2nd really, not because my solver is good
 Marchete: remi is near you in score
 Marchete: so it must be good too
 MSmits: yeah, but he makes sacrifices too easily, even when he's not supposed to. This costs him boxes
 MSmits: I think he might be using a chain-counting mcts like we discussed
 MSmits: but if you havent fully solved, you should not sacrifice
 jacek: join #ru and ask him directly
 MSmits: remi is french :P
 jacek: oh i thought you meant milka
 MSmits: ahh no, i dont need to ask really. I kinda know what he does. He wasnt really secretive about it either
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/569616446">https://www.codingame.com/replay/569616446</a> here you see remi do sacrifice at frame 25 even
 MSmits: there is no way he knows it will help
 MSmits: and he loses the game so...
 Marchete: too early it seems
 jacek: premature sacrifice eh
 MSmits: exactly :P
 Marchete: I'll ad a damn NN and let it do the guessing :D
 Marchete: add*
 MSmits: yeah for early game this might work
 MSmits: or at least, give some small edge
 Marchete: and endgame, damn too :D
 MSmits: nn will also have trouble converging on a good set of weights, but it only has to be better than nothing
 Marchete: just throw more games
 MSmits: yeah, but if the data seems too random to it, it wont help
 MSmits: your training loss will get smaller but the test/validation loss wont change
 Marchete: win/loss will be brought back from endgame
 MSmits: but as i said, it only has to generalize just a teeny bit
 Marchete: like jace_k does
 Marchete: but jk
 Marchete: the game is huge in search space
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I was thinking of trying my solver on smaller versions of D&amp;B to see how it stacks up against the solvers in those papers
 MSmits: up to 5x5 has been solved
 MSmits: the increase in time required goes up extremely fast with 1 size added
 HassanAli4651: can any one help me with this?
 MSmits: so 7x7 is miles away, I think even outside of googles range
 MSmits: this... what?
 HassanAli4651: mars lander ep1
 MSmits: simple if/else solution will work
 HassanAli4651: i tried
 MSmits: if you're going too fast, activate the thrust
 MSmits: otherwise just fall
 MSmits: dont do any other movement
 Marchete: I want someday to try AlphaZero but with graph/features and not the board representation directly, and possible moves as something of high level (like cut a dipper)
 jacek: graph game eh
 MSmits: seems hard Marchete
 MSmits: but many things worth doing are
 Marchete: game -&gt; abstraction-&gt;AZ-&gt;high level move
 MSmits: you need a lot of output though, the game can have many suchs constructs and in many combinations
 MSmits: not sure how to code the policy here
 Marchete: I think less than x,y,side output
 MSmits: I think there are thousands of possible objects
 Marchete: identify possible chains, and possible cuts inside them
 Marchete: and 1 random 
 Marchete: thousands types-&gt;
 Marchete: on the same type, it will be a best to cut
 MSmits: just looking at a dipper for example. It matters how long the loop type is and also how long the attached chain is
 Marchete: by size and similar
 MSmits: so you have like 10 x 10 options right there
 MSmits: for differen dippers
 Marchete: that's true
 MSmits: and that does not include ungrounded dippers
 MSmits: those will have a massive amount of variation
 MSmits: I think x, y side might be easier to do&#160;:)
 MSmits: btw, I made a lookup table for simple endgames
 MSmits: so just isolated chains and loops
 MSmits: I only needed 6k values
 MSmits: but using the lookup table wasnt faster than just running the function
 MSmits: (the one i shared)
 MSmits: that error by mikla's bot i shared earlier would have been 1 of the lookup values

 Westicles: Do we know the date when chat is going to die?
 BlaiseEbuth: There's nothing planned about that.
 Westicles: Ah, good to hear
 BlaiseEbuth: CG don't want to spend time updating/recoding the chat, so they spoke about its suppression. But some of the CG devs are against it, so for now it will just stay as it.
 BlaiseEbuth: Why this question btw?
 Astrobytes: 2061 it will die
 Westicles: Us non-mods just have to try and read the tea leaves
 Astrobytes: We get no special info for the most part unless there's a specific issue
 Astrobytes: To their credit, CG are pretty transparent in that regard
 pci: Sokoban -- I finally figured out what I was doing wrong and why I was struggling to solve some of the test cases within 10 seconds...
 pci: the way I was encoding the state for my visited test was preserving the order of the boxes... by removing that suddenly my 15 second times turned to 1.5 seconds
 pci: Unfortunately I tried a lot of different algorithms before discovering this... then went back to my original and that was all that was needed. :P
 Lordam: Hi all, its very embarassing but even after reading the forum about the puzzle "Encryption/Decryption of Enigma Machine" I cannot figure out why the test cases 4 and 5 always fail (ingame all test cases are green). Anyone any hint? :S

 GarethEddies: I'm looking for someone who can provide some feedback on a code challenge submission before I send it for draft submission
 BobLob: I have some time if you haven't gotten a response yet.
 Eeveee: World Chat could be great way to learn new things from many people, it just doesn't make sense that they are considering to kill it just because it's difficult to maintain
 BobLob: I'm just hearing about this tonight, but it would be rather ironic if a company that was trying to sell its expertise in the coding field found  a chat service difficult to maintain.
 BobLob: Or, maybe maintenance isn't the issue?  Maybe it's lack of use.  There have been 7 messages in the last 6 hours.
 juice0: is the discord channel more popular?
 Wontonimo: nope, the discord channel is pretty dead

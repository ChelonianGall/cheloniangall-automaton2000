 Zenoscave: 1 liners are possible
 Zenoscave: bad metric
 Zenoscave: also it is an introductory puzzle for a reason
 Z_Doctor: different languages can also vary in length. I used Python myself.
 Nullergoj: How do I permentaly disable this chat bar? It capture my input all the time
 Z_Doctor: Not sure about disabling it (besides maybe using some element blocker), but maybe the setting "Hide messages when bar is minimized" will help. @Nullergoj
 Nullergoj: great thanks
 Z_Doctor: Not sure if it works, but if this message doesn't capture your input you're good,
 Nullergoj: well it did capture input&#160;:-(
 eulerscheZahl: Zenoscave still timing out?
 Z_Doctor: Chat doesn't capture input from, as far as I can tell

 CSharp_Sama: sup
 dbdr: nice kovi!
 JobraneAmami: hey
 JobraneAmami: this site is awesome
 wlesavo: dbdr are you trying to optimize guess at smaller numbers or just choosing one from possible pool?
 dbdr: my 318 is just one possible
 dbdr: now I'm trying to do better for small sizes
 wlesavo: i noticed that for example x0 with 1bull would give unreasonable amount of actions
 wlesavo: and in this case its simple enough to come up with heuristic guess, which must be out of pool
 kovi: are there fix testcases?
 Tomer8: Hello World!
 kovi: i get different result with the same random seed
 dbdr: validators are random
 kovi: cool
 dbdr: do you do something fancy?
 kovi: not much
 kovi: no time for that
 wlesavo: yeah, they generated after first guess with same amount of bulls and cows 
 wlesavo: certainly not the best approach, although robust to some extent, could be improved for sure
 eulerscheZahl: god damn kovi :rage:
 dbdr: how many subs do you all have?
 eulerscheZahl: too many, but a lot of broken ones (timeout on 1 or 2 testcases)less timeouts now, as i improved performance
 dbdr: i have 18 if I discount timeouts
 dbdr: 25 total
 eulerscheZahl: lots of high performant languages at the top
 dbdr: surprise surprise&#160;:)
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl are you also yousing one of possibles for a guess on small numbers?
 wlesavo: using
 eulerscheZahl: yesbut not saying that it is smart
 wlesavo: so there is room for improvement
 eulerscheZahl: with 1 bull/cow and 2 digits, i should probably test 2 unknown digits for further cows
 dbdr: yes, but I'm afraid it's smalled compared to the noise
 dbdr: more validators would help reduce the noise
 eulerscheZahl: i have another idea, let's go private @wlesavo
 dbdr: also remove the N=1 case, that's just random
 dbdr: so this by itself adds a 5 +- 5 to interesting results
 eulerscheZahl: noo, that would mean another leaderboard reset
 dbdr: 5 +- 4&#160;:)
 dbdr: any change would, no?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: i it won't reset the leaderboard, so we have to ping julien again
 dbdr: but if you remove N=1 and add 45 more, no need to reset
 dbdr: sorry, i'm stupid
 dbdr: needed indeed
 wlesavo: dbdr im giving strict 5 for first test
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 dbdr: oh, the count does not matter?
 dbdr: nice
 eulerscheZahl: even if i try111...
 dbdr: need to find it I guess
 eulerscheZahl: stopped right in time before the pastebin
 dbdr: pro chatter
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl well yeah, but that seemed necessary
 dbdr: years of training
 eulerscheZahl: i appreciate the hardcoded 5 to reduce noise
 wlesavo: well we could divide points by 10 and add 150 more test i guess :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: we could reduce the max frame count and increase the time per frame
 eulerscheZahl: but it's approved, only touch it if it's broken
 dbdr: if the top is random, it's half broken
 wlesavo: yeah, i regret that, if i would change it rather would change the generator as well
 dbdr: if you make it keep changing the secret
 wlesavo: dbdr maybe you can actually over come the noise
 dbdr: it becomes deterministic, no?
 dbdr: It might just make it solvable
 eulerscheZahl: random is necessary to avoid hardcoing
 wlesavo: dbdr thats what i meant, continuous secret changing 
 reCurse: Random is making rankings a joke though
 reCurse: So pick your poison :P
 eulerscheZahl: i know, both isn't optimal
 dbdr: well, you can pick random among those possible and not proprosed
 eulerscheZahl: but submitting a lot to get the perfect score sucks more IMO
 dbdr: reCurse: a multi also has randomness
 reCurse: It's pretty different and I think you know that
 dbdr: the question is, what is the standard deviation?
 dbdr: I'm saying it's a quantitative question, not qualitativ
 reCurse: There's the third option of making an optim into a multi but some don't like this one for some reason
 dbdr: maybe 1000 rounds would be needed, maybe a million, to detect skill. but should be possible
 wlesavo: i just thought of a way to make it multi
 reCurse: I wish I could ban people for frivolous reasons like "invited me to a clash 10 times in a row"
 dbdr: let's make it a multi-optim-golf-coc&#160;;)
 dbdr: -contest
 wlesavo: -classic puzzle
 eulerscheZahl: others get more CoC invites than me? great!
 dbdr: schadenfreude
 eulerscheZahl: i hate that invite feature
 eulerscheZahl: or is it a bug?
 struct: Just go Yavalath, no rng
 dbdr: write a firefox extension to disable it&#160;;)

 Kayd33n: okay thank you for your help sincerlly
 kovi: oh, i missed a nice discussion about bandc
 kovi: i think fix score on len1 is nice
 kovi: more testcases would help somewhat help the variance (but no-end of contest can still allow weeks of spamsubmits)
 dbdr: even that can be fixed with enough validators
 dbdr: try to get a 6 from a die 100 times in a row. you have as many tries as you want&#160;;)
 dbdr: it will even be hard to be much above the mean
 dbdr: or for a more CG example, it's like saying you can solve high level NS with a dump MC, just add enough CPU&#160;;)
 dbdr: stats do not work like that
 kovi: true
 dbdr: of course it's still a question, how many is enough
 kovi: oh wait, i have dumb mc on NS, maybe that is why im so low&#160;:)
 dbdr: :D
 kovi: wba
 kovi: what was that bull-cow count (first response?) thing, what wlesavo mentioned?
 eulerscheZahl: you guess a number (e.g. 1234567890 on the last testcase)
 eulerscheZahl: and then the referee generates a number that has 3 bulls like 1235678904
 eulerscheZahl: and that's the secret then
 kovi: always 3 bulls or what?
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the validator, but there is one with 3 bulls, 7 cows
 eulerscheZahl: even 2 validators in think
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't do the math, but it might be interesting to add a 0 to your initial guess for having less than 10 digits
 eulerscheZahl: then the referee generates a number with a 0 in it (for the cow) with a bit of luck
 eulerscheZahl: and the 0 has less possible places
 eulerscheZahl: but we would need more knowledge about validators to tell if it's good to have a 0 or not
 kovi: oh i understand, the number of bulls on first response is the secret
 kovi: or both bulls and cows?
 eulerscheZahl: bulls + cows i guessbut you would have to ask wlesavo for details
 kovi: ok, i hope it doesnt matter
 kovi: (as usual i would like to focus on the real problem, not hardcode - test/system abuse)
 eulerscheZahl: same
 kovi: 313
 eulerscheZahl: donald duck?
 kovi: oh i have been there already
 eulerscheZahl: feel free to go back to 313 and declare it as your new best
 kovi: yeah, i needed the better score, cause i got stuck in bender
 eulerscheZahl: at least you solved it
 eulerscheZahl: not as hard as marchete says
 kovi: its hard. so many times i fail on validators
 kovi: without referee i would have given up
 eulerscheZahl: do you know if timeout or correctness?
 kovi: both

 reCurse: Why is it bulls and cows anyway
 dbdr: yeah, it's sexist
 Astrobytes: I always knew the game as "Mastermind"
 MSmits: same
 AntiSquid: time to delete the multi for the sake of progressivism 
 MSmits: mastermind is with 4 places always I think
 struct: I never heard of the game
 reCurse: Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time
 MSmits: and with 6-8 colors
 Astrobytes: Yeah, but we still called variants the same thing
 MSmits: ah ok
 dbdr: Mastermind is a commercial game, based on bulls and cows
 kovi: nice dbdr
 dbdr: kószi&#160;:)
 kovi: i knew i had to spam early for this game&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i know mastermind toobut the version i know has colors instead of digitsand you can use the same color multiple times
 dbdr: how much did you spam?
 kovi: few dozen
 kovi: with minor improvements
 kovi: cant tell if it is better
 dbdr: I did local sim
 dbdr: so I can tell
 kovi: some improvements are toward spamability...
 dbdr: increase variance?
 reCurse: I'm having some accountant ptsd showing up
 kovi: yeah
 eulerscheZahl: i don't
 eulerscheZahl: skipped that contest entirely
 dbdr: I wasn't born

 eulerscheZahl: hypersonic already had a had timing considering my exams back then
 eulerscheZahl: first master semester
 struct: almost done
 kovi: my worst (non-timout) submit today is 6th place
 kovi: nevertheless its a huge range, almost 7% score
 AntiSquid: no tie breaker for score&#160;?
 dbdr: submit date, for display
 kovi: still split for leaderboard?
 dbdr: same CP though
 kovi: oh, didnt know
 kovi: then early spam doesn't matter
 dbdr: CG does fix stuff eventually&#160;:)
 reCurse: :thinking:
 MSmits: this is so annoying. I fixed a timeout bug during a submission. I resubmitted, but one game from the earlier submit was still in the list
 MSmits: so i thought I still had the bug =/
 dbdr: yeah, that happens constantly
 kovi: yeah
 dbdr: closing and reopening the panel works around
 MSmits: yeah i noticed
 kovi: hmm, td needs some attention
 dbdr: lost #1&#160;?
 MSmits: you mean euler needs to fix something, more players need to join or you need to work on it kovi

 MSmits: I have a c++ question
 MSmits: say I have this:
 MSmits: uint64_t boards[2];
 MSmits: and i do this:
 MSmits: memcpy(boards, _boards, 4 * sizeof(uint32_t));
 MSmits: is this undefined behavior?
 kovi: its ok
 MSmits: the _boards is uint32_t
 MSmits: array
 MSmits: [4]
 kovi: you just need to consider endianness
 MSmits: how do I consider that?
 MSmits: also, I doubt endianness matters here, I am using this as a hash
 MSmits: if I am always copying the same way it doesnt matter right?
 kovi: first 32bit will be the highest bits of the firts 64bit
 MSmits: ohh ok
 kovi: (in 99.9% of todays hw)
 MSmits: hw?
 MSmits: hardware ah
 Astrobytes: hardware
 kovi: almost always little endian
 MSmits: doesnt explain my problem I think
 MSmits: I get weird time outs on a TT in checkers
 MSmits: my state is 4 uint32_t boards and i was copying it into uint64_t, then making a hash key out of it
 MSmits: endianness wont matter there
 dbdr: 4 * 32 bits into 64 bits?
 Astrobytes: uint64_t[2]
 MSmits: yeah sorry, what Astrobytes said
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b56a6707-e50d-4fbf-99df-663042263715">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/b56a6707-e50d-4fbf-99df-663042263715</a>
 MSmits: doing this
 dbdr: why do you think this is related to the timeout?
 MSmits: because when i remove it, i dont timeout
 MSmits: it's probably a side-effect i havent considered
 dbdr: Note:if foo then true else false=&gt; return foo
 dbdr: just simpler
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: yeah i dont know many syntactic tricks
 Astrobytes: return (s1.boards[0] == s2.boards[0] &amp;&amp; s1.boards[1] == s2.boards[1])
 dbdr: it's not really a trick, is it?
 MSmits: no, it;s shorter
 Astrobytes: Also, structs are public by default
 dbdr: just a normal return
 reCurse: It's code golfing
 dbdr: code elephanting?
 MSmits: well cool, I like shorter code. I'll change that thanks
 reCurse: That's not very inclusive towards elephants
 struct: Also you can name stuff with only one letter
 Astrobytes: Elephantist
 dbdr: it is, big = good&#160;:)
 struct: struct A{
 struct: #define struct s
 struct: s A{
 dbdr: MSmits we can't fix your timeout, but we can golf your code
 dbdr: apparently
 eulerscheZahl: struct deleted {
 reCurse: delete struct;
 struct: soon
 reCurse: struct() = deleted;
 MSmits: yeah, thanks dbdr and Astrobytes, not sure why i didnt see this myself. Probably because I copied it from a googling spree at some point
 dbdr: not as bad as your loop written as a recursion&#160;;)
 MSmits: that was funny
 kovi:&#160;:)
 MSmits: i did actually code that myself
 MSmits: i think it started as something which made sense to be recursive and then i simplified the code to the point where its a loop
 MSmits: but its still recursive
 Astrobytes: Was this your infinite loop you had a short while ago?
 MSmits: no that was oware i think
 MSmits: this is checkers
 MSmits: i have infinite loops a lot
 dbdr: dump idea, but could that be related to timeouts?&#160;;)
 struct: Everyone has
 MSmits: this time I dont know if it is an infinite loop dbdr 
 MSmits: it's just a timeout that happens when i activate TT's
 dbdr: though linux is supposed to run infinite loops in less than 5 seconds
 dbdr: but on CG that's still timeout
 MSmits: I see
 reCurse: run infinite loop in finite time
 reCurse: cool
 dbdr: it's THAT fast&#160;;)
 MSmits: it's like how mathematicians invented holes in the ground that are infinitely deep and you can fill them with 3 buckets of water
 dbdr: or infinite surface and volume 0&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh did i mention this checkers timeout only happens when I activate the TT *AND* turn on optimizations?
 reCurse: Run it locally
 reCurse: CG is not a debugging environment
 MSmits: yeah, i should do that. My VS compiler will have different optimizations though. But I may get lucky

 MSmits: the problem is not the virus I think
 dbdr: why cancel a trip because of it?
 dbdr: you can also catch it at home
 MSmits: reCurse doesnt want to get stuck in some quarantine
 MSmits: if he's quarantined he wants to be home
 AntiSquid: idk how they came up with the 50% statistic, but it gives Thanos vibes
 dbdr: quarantine is not too bad if you have a laptop, is it?&#160;;)
 reCurse: quarantine or just getting the virus and rolling 1 on the disease check
 MSmits: true, you can still do uttt in a hotel in Germany
 Astrobytes: Well I've been advised to self-isolate now since I have 'flu
 MSmits: flu or cold?

 MSmits: I am guessing they would still ask them to Astrobytes =/
 Astrobytes: lol MSmits
 reCurse: You need to beat the trend

 MSmits: well, it's not hate. I just dont generally like disney songs. I know :P
 MSmits: oh... I tested it with only the insertion of the state. So i dont do any TT except inserting states and it times out
 MSmits: I think I run out of memory 
 MSmits: thats why it doesnt happen with optimizations off
 MSmits: it's too slow to fill the memory
 MSmits: yep, just reduced calc time and i get no timeouts even with TT's on
 Astrobytes: just download more memory. ezpz
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: But how are you running out of memory? It can't be that large surely

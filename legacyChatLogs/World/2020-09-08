 MadKnight: is anyone still there, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i have no idea what's that
 MadKnight: wow, chat is lagging super badly
 MadKnight: [CG]SaiksyApo can u fix it&#160;?
 Marchete: hi hi Maddy
 Bbaaii: what can i sayyyy except your welcomeeeeeee
 Bbaaii: for the sun and the moon and the sky
 Bbaaii: hey its ok its ok your welcome
 MadKnight: hihi Marchete let's go PM
 markyy: I just solved puzzle of the week and reached level 12 weeeeee
 markyy: and I enjoyed the puzzle of the week
 wlesavo: its a nice one
 Xedux: PhantomzBack&#160;?
 Xedux: can you give your recent clash code&#160;?
 Xedux: PhantomzBack&#160;?
 Xedux: hello
 PhantomzBack: Hey
 PhantomzBack: i think don't have it I discarded it
 PhantomzBack: But i just used two recursive for loops and printed a space between characters, but after exiting the inner loop, you just print a new line
 Xedux: ok
 LinhT.Nguyen: john brzenk
 MSmits: hi
 jacek: good afternoon
 MSmits: are you working on anything for CG jacek?
 jrke: MS how is your endgame solver
 MSmits: currently if I try 1000 games, my slowest solve is 140 ms and average is 2 ms
 MSmits: (per game)
 MSmits: but if i try 10k games, one of them takes 800 ms. It's the really rare games that are super slow
 jrke: thats great achievement for now
 MSmits: yeah, I got transposition tables to work
 MSmits: now it's mostly trying to find the right heuristics. Some heuristics make my solver 10x faster, but are exactl 99% of the time, it's frustrating
 MSmits: there's often some rare exception
 jrke: okay 
 jrke: yeah exceptions are always there even exceptions have also exceptions
 MSmits: yeah, that's what I am talking about mostly. The exceptions to the exceptions... quite rare
 MSmits: I could probably ignore them and accept losing those games
 MSmits: but I would like it to give an exact score
 MSmits: also I am pretty sure there's more theorems and corollaries to explore in those papers that I can use
 MSmits: somehow
 jrke: you can play those games manually and fix them right?
 MSmits: oh, right, that's another option. Possibly the exceptions are so rare, I can hardcode them
 MSmits: but not manually, it's too hard to play them manually
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7c5e4ec-cd35-48e5-be95-2128f0cc627f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e7c5e4ec-cd35-48e5-be95-2128f0cc627f</a>
 MSmits: this is the hardest one of my 10k seeds test
 jrke: ok
 MSmits: looks messy right?
 jrke: yeah but its having 3 chains or more?
 jrke: can your current heuristic defeats dbdr?
 MSmits: the problem is all the splits (joins). It only has 1 isolated chain
 MSmits: the length 3 one
 MSmits: the rest are strings (as they call them) connected to splits
 MSmits: if you play one string on a 3-join, the other 2 strings combine into 1 chain
 MSmits: or a string, if it is connected to yet more joins
 jrke: really a tough one to get accurate Ai for this particular one
 MSmits: yeah, well... I got one that calculates it perfectly I think, though it is hard to test
 MSmits: problem is it takes 800 ms now
 MSmits: which still helps I guess. I am guessing it can solve within 100 ms, after the first string is opened, so it's not a waste of effort in any case
 dbdr: avx it&#160;;)
 jrke: yeah optimise code
 MSmits: I will do that, but that's a matter of a factor of 2 or 3 at most. It's not enough to get it below 100 ms
 MSmits: avx will be almost impossible I think
 MSmits: i dont even know what to parallize in a graph
 jrke: pragamas are nice way to optimize 
 MSmits: also I was thinking about using this for a mcts bot, do the solve at the end of the rollout, but that's not feasible
 MSmits: currently my average is 2ms per game, so at most 50 rollouts or so
 MSmits: not enough to get any good stats
 dbdr: quality vs quantity
 MSmits: yeah..  so maybe I should just stick with minimax
 dbdr: those 50 are worth many more random endgames
 MSmits: thats definitely true
 MSmits: random seems completely pointless into an endgame
 MSmits: it's quite good in the early game though
 jrke: but you can not detect random endgame against random or weak bot
 MSmits: hmm not sure what you mean
 MSmits: do you mean that if the bot plays badly, the endgame will look so different that my solver doesnt apply?
 MSmits: I don't think that's true. The only effect a badly playing bot will have is that it is giving away boxes earlier, so the endgames will be smaller (less objects), which in general means it solves faster
 jrke: yeah thats true
 MSmits: it calculates a score difference
 MSmits: so it takes the current score and finds the maximum score on top of that
 MSmits: so if you're +10 ahead and it calculates -5, you still win, that's mostly what will happen vs bad bots
 jrke: hmm
 MSmits: it also assumes the opponent will play perfectly
 MSmits: so the score calculated is always a lower bound
 MSmits: it can only get better
 jrke: then it will work
 MSmits: but that's always true for minimax
 MSmits: I want to get it reliably below 100 ms, before I convert it into  a  live bot though
 MSmits: more work to do&#160;:)
 jrke:&#160;:)
 MSmits: super happy i finally made a minimax with both ab pruning and TT. I just copied the technique from a chess article
 dbdr: D&amp;B is a rabbit hole
 MSmits: it definitely is
 dbdr: which article?
 dbdr: well done!
 MSmits: Alpha-Beta with Sibling Prediction Pruningin Chess
 MSmits: it has a lot of info
 MSmits: I guess it is more a book
 MSmits: 52 pages
 dbdr: dutch&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol I didn't even see that
 MSmits: it's often Dutch isn't it?
 MSmits: that's even my university
 dbdr: :D
 jrke: going for submit MS?
 dbdr: jrke is impatient to see MSmits' bot&#160;:)
 MSmits: not for a while I think. As I said it still needs improvement. Also on friday i get the key to my new house
 MSmits: that will be a lot of work
 dbdr: why? a key is not that heavy
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: painting and :poop:
 jrke: i will be there for help 
 MSmits: nahh, you go make more bots. 
 MSmits: it's awesome you do so well
 jrke: im really impatient&#160;:)
 dbdr: I don't recommend painting with :poop:
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: cheap though
 dbdr: it's a tradeoff
 MSmits: I think it's actually not that cheap
 MSmits: to get enough :poop: for that
 jrke: :key: your key is here 
 dbdr: I don't know, in the right places they might pay you to take away their :poop:
 MSmits: I was hoping to leave enough money to pay people to paint and stuff
 MSmits: but wife spent most of it already&#160;:)
 dbdr: reminds me of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaZuBziWLgk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaZuBziWLgk</a>
 MSmits: funny&#160;:)
 dbdr: what did she spend it on?
 dbdr: actually this one is better: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v1zV8n0cA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-v1zV8n0cA</a>
 MSmits: furniture mostly. I guess we didn't replace it for 13 years so she wanted to get all new stuff
 MSmits: floors seem very expensive also
 MSmits: and window stuff
 dbdr: will have new furniture but no floor? :D
 MSmits: no no, got new floors, it just cost several thousand Euros... 
 jrke: just flying in air 
 jrke: :stuck_out_tongue:
 dbdr: attach furniture to the ceiling
 dbdr: sounds like a fun house&#160;:)
 MSmits: heh yeah
 wzg: 为什么我不能玩
 MSmits: my openingbook is better than that
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: given the right decoding, that's actually a perfect openingbook
 dbdr: MSmits did you investigate the novel parts of that thesis?
 dbdr: Sibling Prediction Pruning
 DomiKo: can i get link to Euler site with chat history?
 dbdr: :rolling_eyes:
 DomiKo: I should bookmark it...
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/Main_Page</a>
 dbdr: I made that side, for info&#160;:)

 dbdr: *site
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 DomiKo: wait
 dbdr: that's not chat history
 DomiKo: this is not euler's site?
 jrke: it is euler site of codingame puzzles

 DomiKo: yes i know
 dbdr: cg.spdns.eu is the community wiki, which I made
 DomiKo: I mean cg.spdns
 DomiKo: oh ... my bad... I don't know why I thought that was Euler's
 dbdr: probably he gave the link&#160;:)
 DomiKo: maybe
 DomiKo: now I will remember
 MSmits: dbdr, nah i didnt read everything yet. Was just looking to see how to handle updating alpha and beta with TT. It's hard to wrap your head arouns
 MSmits: around
 dbdr: DomiKo, no worries&#160;:)
 jacek: no need to worry with alpha and beta in jacekmax
 MSmits: gamma though, how about gamma?
 dbdr: αβγ
 dbdr: upgrade your keyboard layouts&#160;:)
 MSmits: :alpha:
 MSmits: that's all I'm gonna try, if it isn't an emote, it isn't worth it
 dbdr: it's a letter, why would you need an emote?
 dbdr: -- δβδρ
 DomiKo: ß²
 dbdr: and γ⁵
 dbdr: thanks to euler for that one
 DomiKo: and the best one X Æ A-12

 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: long time no see absentbytes
 Astrobytes: haha, yeah. Catching up on work, missed a week and ended up with a huge backlog
 MSmits: hey... I went to all parties I was invited to in college
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: i mean uni
 Astrobytes: But how many were you invited to? :P
 MSmits: ooohh so long ago, can't remember :PP
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: What's the meta on Dots n Boxes then?
 MSmits: I think the bots that are currently on the leaderboard do minimax
 MSmits: i was going to do a mcts with a random rollout and a solver at the end of the rollout, but solving is too slow currently
 MSmits: average endgame takes 2 ms to solve and some take up to a second almost
 MSmits: still looking for better heuristics for the solver, I have some hope left&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Cool. It seems quite an interesting problem
 Astrobytes: (the game that is)
 MSmits: yeah addictive
 Astrobytes: haha, they always are&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: Hey Msmits do we have any homework for Thursday?
 DomiKo: :joy:
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Thiesjoo: Easiest way to contact him&#160;:)
 DomiKo: that was unexpected
 Astrobytes: well played Thiesjoo
 Illedan: lol
 jacek: if you want to contact him, just write 3 3 is best opening for yavalath
 dbdr: write your message to MSmits at the end of your action after a ';'
 Marchete: say that an endgame in D&amp;B doesn't have 3-way boxes
 Marchete: triggered :D
 MSmits: lol Thiesjoo
 MSmits: no homework
 PhantomzBack: Guys i am facing an issue
 PhantomzBack: i print the correct thing it shows even in the standard output stream
 PhantomzBack: but it shows found nothing
 Uljahn: could be extra \n
 DinuBrat: Тут на русском можно общаться&#160;? )
 DinuBrat: :upside_down:
 Uljahn: а то
 Uljahn: join #ru
 DinuBrat: пасиб ) 
 EveryOS: Guys I am facing an issueIt says "only puzzle owners can access this puzzle" instead of showing puzzlesAnd when I reload, it signs me out
 Uljahn: which one?
 EveryOS: Literally just going on any tabThe exact error is: An error occurred (#511): "Only the owner can access puzzles progress".
 EveryOS: I also get errors #498 and #522 a few times
 DomiKo: wow
 DomiKo: there is 1 point gat in Langon between 20 and 21
 EveryOS: Well the site isn't working, keep getting error 511, so just gonna close
 ProCoder3: #fr
 dbdr: DomiKo, there are even bigger gaps near the top&#160;:)
 DomiKo: I'm trying to fill them 
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 DomiKo: right now I'm stealing some pruning
 dbdr: stealing?
 jacek: prune array?
 DomiKo: Stealing from top10 ;P
 dbdr: not sure what you mean
 Astrobytes: Prune thief.
 dbdr: from the neighbour's tree
 DomiKo: I have 0% winrate with some guys, because my heuristic is much worse... and I can't preddict their move
 dbdr: hm, with minimax trees make sense :D
 DomiKo: so I'm trying to understand which moves they could make
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: if you understand what RedStike does differently...
 DomiKo: I wish...
 Astrobytes: He still way ahead in Langton?
 dbdr: 4 pts above #2
 Astrobytes: wow
 dbdr: in java
 Astrobytes: yeah I remember 
 Astrobytes: What does he use? Does anyone know?
 Astrobytes: Algo that is
 dbdr: someone said minimax
 Astrobytes: Oh really? Interesting
 dbdr: I noticed sometimes he ends the game early
 Astrobytes: Going off-grid?
 Astrobytes: Well, hitting the wall
 dbdr: yeah
 Astrobytes: Yeah I remember that being a viable strategy. I must fix my Langton bot
 Astrobytes: So many games, not enough hours
 dbdr: Domiiko: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/485851765">https://www.codingame.com/replay/485851765</a>

 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/485727767">https://www.codingame.com/replay/485727767</a>going out
 DomiKo: but
 DomiKo: that's no my current bot
 dbdr: but this one does not look that good
 DomiKo: I guess
 DomiKo: if I cant find battle in last battles 
 DomiKo: then it have to be my prev version?
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: "you timeout"that text sounds familiar
 dbdr: :D
 lamnd: :grinning:
 starmaq: :grinning:
 DomiKo: ohh yes
 DomiKo: half steal from Euler
 DomiKo: and top10 for me :D
 eulerscheZahl: dude&#160;:/
 DomiKo: your moves and sometimes so random for me
 eulerscheZahl: how did you even do that? i don't even remember myself what i'm doing :D
 DomiKo: are*
 eulerscheZahl: something like test X cells on the current path and neighboring cells
 DomiKo: I'm not sure too
 DomiKo: yea i know
 DomiKo: everybody do that I guess
 DomiKo: but everybody use sometime else
 DomiKo: with Redstrike i have a lot of misses
 eulerscheZahl: and that causes blind spots for the minimax
 eulerscheZahl: redstrike always surprises me. i see that by observing my expected score
 DomiKo: I'm using MCTS and that's blind spot too..
 DomiKo: its like one random move
 DomiKo: and my whole tree is :poop:
 dbdr: DomiKo, so you're trying to reverse engineer various players?
 jrke: 12 Nov fall challenge yeah just 2 days after my birthday&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, we have a date now?
 eulerscheZahl: indeed :o
 jrke: yes timer is here check it out
 jrke: i just saw it
 eulerscheZahl: and it lasts 11 days again
 eulerscheZahl: The event starts on Thursday, November 12 at 3 pm UTC and ends on Monday, November 23 at 9 am UTC.
 eulerscheZahl: not the usual 6pm CEST
 eulerscheZahl: or CET at that point
 dbdr: I guess that's better for east asia
 eulerscheZahl: for such a long contest duration i don't really care
 jrke: it will be 8:30 pm my country
 dbdr: there's just a special feeling on the first day
 dbdr: might be strange to wake up to a new contest everyone else has already started
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/vwiz0FQ">https://imgur.com/a/vwiz0FQ</a>can't join&#160;:/
 jrke: last time it began at 9:30 pm i.e. 4pm UTC right
 dbdr: eulers misses the contest :scream:
 dbdr: blacklisted
 eulerscheZahl: and there's a ping on the CG discord announcement channel (@here?) that i can't see for whatever reason
 eulerscheZahl: that channel isn't loading
 dbdr: yeah, for me too
 jrke: i got 1 rank promotion due to euler non participating&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: nah, you might be able to beat me in a fight&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: oh, now i could load the message on discord
 jrke: i will try my best but i just spended 6 months on coding so i have less experience
 eulerscheZahl: and another unofficial "contest" like the one from thibpat
 jrke: by whoom is that contest sendme a link if you have any for that
 eulerscheZahl: are you on the CG discord?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hs-emina.github.io/autumnai.github.io/">https://hs-emina.github.io/autumnai.github.io/</a>
 jrke: yes but not very much active
 [CG]Thibaud: oh really, you can't see the channel announcements?
 eulerscheZahl: working again now
 eulerscheZahl: was lagging for a minute or 2
 DomiKo: dbdr yes
 [CG]Thibaud: :thinking_face:
 eulerscheZahl: but i still can't register to the real contest
 [CG]Thibaud: the Fall challenge&#160;?
 [CG]Thibaud: or AUtumn AI 2020&#160;?
 dbdr: using heuristics DomiKo? because I think most top players use search...
 eulerscheZahl: CODINGAME FALL CHALLENGE 2020
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/vwiz0FQ">https://imgur.com/a/vwiz0FQ</a>
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah, just saw your imgur
 [CG]Thibaud: arf
 jrke: is Autumn AI organised by Crypticsy with CG?
 eulerscheZahl: that autumn AI is just promoting an existing multiplayer game
 aCat: ah, ok, thx for the info
 Astrobytes: like the one thibpat did
 DomiKo: dbbr I'm using MCTS with heuristic for me and my opponent
 Hjax: yay another unofficial contest
 Hjax: should be fun :D 
 dbdr: ah ok, makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: can it be PR2 again? :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 Hjax: my pr2 bot has no flaws, its perfect :P 
 jrke: is multi decided yet?
 eulerscheZahl: probably
 eulerscheZahl: but not revealed
 dbdr: should be one with few participants
 Hjax: the announcement said they were going to pick one that most of the people who sign up havent played
 Hjax: so i doubt theyve picked one already 
 eulerscheZahl: ok, TL;DR :P
 jrke: can be BotG then
 Astrobytes: eww
 eulerscheZahl: blasphemia
 dbdr: whether they have decided or not is like asking if schrodinger's cat is alive before you open the box
 Hjax: im not sure which game i want them to pick 
 dbdr: plot twist: they choose CSB
 dbdr: would be an occasion for me to do it :D
 Hjax: are you going to play this contest? 
 jrke: yeah dbdr is not in CSB arena
 dbdr: not esp motivated, but I might if I haven't done the multi
 jrke: but i can't update my CSB bot now
 Hjax: you are pretty high up on the "people who will smoke me in a multi" list :P
 jrke: bored by doing CSB continously by last 5 months
 Hjax: my csb is just the silly oneliner thing 
 dbdr: same
 eulerscheZahl: my CSB doesn't know how collisions work
 dbdr: lol
 jrke: my CSB bot doesn't know whats collab&#160;;)
 jrke: its having single pod simulation not combined
 eulerscheZahl: much easier for PCR: you don't collide, you merge
 reCurse: Except when you do collide
 dbdr: ^
 Hjax: theres a few games ive wanted to play but never really worked much on 
 jrke: i will like OOC 
 eulerscheZahl: same mass is rare enough to be ignored :P
 reCurse: Rare enough except when it's not (the first 10-15 frames)
 dbdr: that's why you have a bad rank eulerscheZahl&#160;;)
 <b>**dbdr needs to check euler's rank</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: just kidding, I handle this case
 Hjax: locm would be fun
 <b>**eulerscheZahl is below dbdr</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: wait, i won't join that "contest" anyways, so go ahead
 dbdr: but you still have a decent rank
 reCurse: I can tell you didn't try locm since you have this opinion
 dbdr: ah no, below Illedan, not decent
 Illedan: huh?
 eulerscheZahl: now you summoned him, see what you've done!
 dbdr: just trolling euler, don't worry Illedan&#160;:)
 Illedan: I'm looking at the glorious counter for the next contest
 dbdr: oh, another rust in top 10 on PCR, gg tomatoes
 Illedan: Time to apply for some vacation days
 dbdr: and top 3 looks like a toss up
 eulerscheZahl: i usually take off really shortly. like: have a nice weekend, btw i'll be away next week
 eulerscheZahl: so far no one complained :D
 Illedan: :D
 reCurse: Also gives you the leeway to ragequit if it's with fog of war again
 Hjax: ^ pacman made me ragequit&#160;:(
 Illedan: No problem if I just show up to work anyway
 eulerscheZahl: yes, good thing it starts on a thursday again
 Illedan: Oh
 Illedan: nice
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: wow, that sounds unusual for employees, no?
 reCurse: With WFH no one knows you're working on the contest anyway
 Illedan: :angel:
 eulerscheZahl: be boss is really chill as long as i get my stuff done
 Hjax: my usual pattern is to go to work anyway, and be very unproductive as i think about the game all day
 Illedan: ^
 Hjax: and then go home and implement my ideas 
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder when RAIC will take place
 reCurse: Next contest needs to be fog of war, incomplete inputs, 4 players and fixed start state.
 reCurse: Then I might ragequit enough to delete my account :p
 Hjax: needs a random element too 
 reCurse: I like you
 eulerscheZahl: have you been struct all along?
 Astrobytes: speaking of whom, is he back yet?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Illedan: And cooperation
 dbdr: I think the SDK supports 8 players
 eulerscheZahl: yes, it does&#160;:)
 Hjax: 4v4 moba, fog of war, random item drops 
 Astrobytes: I don't think I'd even open the IDE if it were 8 players
 Hjax: perfect 
 eulerscheZahl: but RAIC had a contest with 10, coop with 5 players per team
 Illedan: What about that BACK command from BTTC?
 eulerscheZahl: dota-like contest
 reCurse: I'm starting to think contest designers are not optimizing for fun but for torture
 [CG]Thibaud: registration should be fixed eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, i'm registered now
 dbdr: damn, one place in the 4-10 range is taken
 Hjax: i wonder if teccles will return for the fall contest 
 eulerscheZahl: to claim #2?
 Hjax: as is tradition 
 reCurse: Savage
 Astrobytes: didn't he say he was done with contests?
 Hjax: maybe he will change his mind 
 MadKnight: why did he say that&#160;?
 MadKnight: what happened to him, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: like it was in the middle of the game
 eulerscheZahl: MK are you done with contests?
 Astrobytes: Something about the time investment not being worth it
 Astrobytes: Oh hey MK
 reCurse: He's definitely right
 Hjax: what? working 80 hours for a tshirt isnt worth it? 
 Hjax: :P
 eulerscheZahl: 10 full days for a tshirt and a canvas for him. i don't see the problem
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Hjax: idk i was pretty pleased with my utg tshirt 
 eulerscheZahl: for UTG he even got a 500€ amazon voucher, didn't he?
 reCurse: Trophies are nicer though
 eulerscheZahl: agreed. i don't need something that i can easily buy myself in a shop
 eulerscheZahl: the tshirt or canvas is more unique, even if it's relatively cheap regarding money
 reCurse: Canvas is more unique but doesn't really fit to hang
 reCurse: Trophy looks nice in a showcase
 eulerscheZahl: i placed the canvas on a free spot on the bookshelf
 dbdr: how did you win a canvas? creator?
 reCurse: I guess, it's kinda big though
 eulerscheZahl: and not in direct sunlight so the colors will stay intact longer
 reCurse: Can't make it really fit anyway
 eulerscheZahl: yes, creatorkutulu and ocean of code
 reCurse: Creator and top 3
 Astrobytes: You're supposed to hang/put  certificates and awards in the toilet, so everyone is forced to look at them at some point&#160;;)
 reCurse: That's next level thinking
 eulerscheZahl: and at cotc i had really bad luck in the recalc. a really nice schubc asked me for my address and sent my a hypnotoad canvas :D
 eulerscheZahl: the pirate hypnotoad i used for the contest
 dbdr: wow, nice!
 Astrobytes: lol, awesome
 eulerscheZahl: wanted to thank him with a double tshirt later on but he never saw my message&#160;:(
 dbdr: wait, you finished #82
 dbdr: I thought you were close to top 3 :D
 eulerscheZahl: was around 25 before the recalc
 eulerscheZahl: dropped to 91
 eulerscheZahl: up to 82 because they removed cheaters
 dbdr: just because of luck? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: submitted the same bot again in the multiplayer, back to ~25
 reCurse: :thinking:
 reCurse: With 60 missing bots from contest?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i still have no idea what was going on in that recalc
 eulerscheZahl: i mean i had a rank similar to those who placed around rank 25 in the contest
 dbdr: maybe you fare poorly against the leaked code?
 dbdr: that would bias things
 eulerscheZahl: i had about 50% winrate most of the time during recalc yet kept dropping
 eulerscheZahl: even had a lucky streak with winning 2 out of 3 games for about 100 matches, barely climbing. then back to 50% winrate and free fall
 dbdr: winrate means very little
 eulerscheZahl: too bad we don't get the full recalc history anymore
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise we could ask pb 4 about his alternative ranking
 reCurse: It's still biased though
 reCurse: Especially if the relevant range is missing due to matchmaking
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think there's the perfect leaderboard
 reCurse: Perfect no, much better yes I think so
 eulerscheZahl: true, matchmaking is a relevant point
 reCurse: But kind of hard when implementation is blackboxed
 eulerscheZahl: i have the code but not sure if he's fine with me sharing it
 reCurse: I meant CG's
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 reCurse: We found bugs in the Halite system thanks to its open source
 dbdr: I thought for a second euler has CG's matchmaking code :D
 reCurse: For matchmaking
 eulerscheZahl: i remember riddles having a flawed matchmaking (surprise, surprise)
 eulerscheZahl: i complained, got ignored
 dbdr: honestly, I think it might work to create an open source platform
 reCurse: Don't make it just take Halite's and work from there
 Astrobytes: I guess with CG it's tied in with their business
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like a lot of work :sweat:
 reCurse: Good luck getting funds though
 reCurse: Halite is really up there in quality
 eulerscheZahl: hm, forking halite sounds reasonable
 dbdr: funds for what? hosting/cpu?
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: Halite costed in the tens of thousands IIRC
 eulerscheZahl: they ran a lot of matches
 dbdr: per?
 eulerscheZahl: every few minutes and thousands of players
 eulerscheZahl: per contest i guess
 reCurse: They did have GPU instances though
 reCurse: Forgot how much it took from the budget
 reCurse: But yeah it's not cheap running those things
 reCurse: One thing to be thankful for here
 dbdr: sure, it's great CG exists and seem to be stable
 eulerscheZahl: other sites come and go. CG hosts less contests now but they keep happening
 eulerscheZahl: and all old games still available
 reCurse: I miss when contests happened all the time
 reCurse: Wish I joined 2 years prior
 eulerscheZahl: i also feel like i missed some fun there
 dbdr: you would have burned out two years earlier too, ore more&#160;;)
 reCurse: Can't say the last 2 years were the best so I'm fine with that
 eulerscheZahl: back then there were less strong competitors i think
 eulerscheZahl: and earlier burnout would have allowed reCurse to detect poorly designed games earlier and skip them
 Illedan: I think the information and sharing has made the general player far better these days..
 dbdr: not sure about the general player, but the top ones, probably
 Illedan: Because the top ones did read it? :P
 Astrobytes: The real turning point was when reCurse taught everyone how to write bit streams :P
 eulerscheZahl: that changed my life
 reCurse: The infamous stream
 reCurse: Never doing that again but I'm glad I did
 MSmits: I need to watch that
 eulerscheZahl: it's better than GAimax
 MSmits: do bits get even better when they're streaming?
 Astrobytes: fwiw you were a good streamer
 Illedan: The "failed" stream was good too reCurse
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 Astrobytes: shhh
 dbdr: what was the failed one?
 Astrobytes: It doesn't exist.
 eulerscheZahl: we don't talk about it
 dbdr: reCurse: if only you used assert, you could have gone pro twitcher
 reCurse: I gained a lot of respect for streamers
 reCurse: Definitely a job
 MSmits: lol, you went from no respect to, it's a job
 MadKnight: such a funny story
 reCurse: I didn't say no respect
 MSmits: ok ok
 reCurse: But it's one of those things you don't realize how much work it is until you try
 reCurse: For me anyway
 Illedan: Agreed
 dbdr: yeah, and there's a selection biasyou mostly see the successful ones, so each to underestimate the difficulty
 MSmits: mmh I can see that, I made a few videos and it was a lot of work, streaming is probably more difficult
 Illedan: And failing live feels really bad
 MSmits: dbdr isn't that true for most creative jobs?
 Illedan: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger?
 dbdr: I think the effect is magnified online
 dbdr: similar to movies and other broadcast art
 dbdr: not the case for live art
 MSmits: I see
 dbdr: but yes, there selection bias in a lot of places
 dbdr: startups too, for instance
 dbdr: probably 90%+ fail, a lot of talk a lot about the 0.0001% that becomes multibillion companies
 MSmits: are you saying that not all startups turn into facebook?
 dbdr: :scream:
 reCurse: The worst is when people think there's lessons to be learned from it, as if it's something reproducible...
 dbdr: to be fair there are probably *some* lessons, if you abstract from the specifics
 reCurse: You can't have startups in the billions left and right
 dbdr: oh yeah, that's part of my point
 dbdr: does not mean there is nothing to learn to increase your chances if you want to try
 reCurse: So how much there is to learn is very debatable and probably vastlyoverestimated
 reCurse: Because I doubt the founders themselves know everything that came into play and be honest about it
 reCurse: A lot of it is luck + timing on top of the huge amount of work needed to have a startup not fail miserably
 reCurse: I meant how much you learn with them vs a successful but very low profile startup
 reCurse: Did anyone even get in the millions just following in the footsteps of another huge one? shrug
 dbdr: just saw this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I</a>Is Success Luck or Hard Work?
 Hjax: is success luck or hard work? i think the answer is "yes"
 jacek: thats my line
 dbdr: nothing earth shattering but some good points
 reCurse: imo success is hard work, but breaking it big is luck or timing or both
 dbdr: came up with a nice simple model to give a quantitative answer
 reCurse: But I'll watch thanks
 jacek: and again, new tab with random number opened
 jacek: and its loading
 reCurse: Malicious extension maybe
 Astrobytes: It's all that pony stuff you like jacek, it's coming back to bite you
 FlamingPostItNote_2371: hello
 jacek: good evening
 lil.ashsz: hi
 maxmanusv1: yo
 kovi: interesting video
 kovi: unfortunately in many areas luck plays much higher role
 kovi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://barabasi.com/book/the-formula">https://barabasi.com/book/the-formula</a>
 jacek: just like the leaderboard
 Marchete: luck... and godparents/money
 Marchete: at least in many areas or circles
 kovi: yeah, research reveals the importance of early supporters/promoters
 jacek: meow
 jacek: Automaton2000 meow?
 Automaton2000: it's too late for me to be able to look at the top
 Whitelegend: Hi everyone, in a test case clash creation, how to set an output to the single char [SPACE]&#160;? any idea&#160;?
 jacek: print(" ")&#160;?
 Whitelegend: You mean i have to write [print(" ")] in the output field of the test case&#160;?
 jacek: youre contributing the clash?
 Whitelegend: yeah i'm trying to create one
 Illedan: Great video dbdr. thx
 dbdr: glad you liked it
 DomiKo: 30% win rate against Redstrike that's an improvement
 Uljahn: liked it too, thx
 Stilgart: Automaton2000: what does the turtle say?
 Automaton2000: so if you were asking
 jacek: so youre gonna like this video <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ujeb.se/YFyM">https://ujeb.se/YFyM</a>
 The_Auditor: anybody done the weekly chalange?
 Jaek: thanks for reminding me tho xd
 Schwase: why is the clash bot so good???
 Schwase: that french one is just insane
 T1Anias: i have done the weekly
 Ryanless: is there a way to use a real debugger? my code has a nearly impossible to find bug. And just the Console.Log messages don't cut it
 The_Auditor: copy the source in your favourite IDE&#160;?
 Ryanless: well i play this bot challenges. So i would still need then to create a game mook that provides input, changes game state, acts on the ouput of code
 The_Auditor: ah, i see. the you are stuck with the Console.Log, i think... but i'm new here ... so, what do i know

 Flyingkid: @Ryanless u don't have to do any of that. Aren't u just debugging? Can just copy inputs given to bot as well (just Console.log them too) and use that as input file in your fave IDE like @The_Auditor suggested.
 Xedux: @SuperMuppet 
 Xedux: can  you give your recent clash code&#160;?
 Flyingkid: So we're waiting until Novemer 12th show-down time...
 XilinWan: m={'

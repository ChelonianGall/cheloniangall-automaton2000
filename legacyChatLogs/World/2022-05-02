 eulerscheZahl: 70th. yesterday this submit made it to top3 for a short time&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: same code
 rcrl: gold league is stuck
 rcrl: Boss is too high&#160;:')
 Miki09: yeah...
 rcrl: Need silver players to beat their boss 
 rcrl: It'll unstuck gold top
 yhyoxx: come silver
 yhyoxx: come on*
 MAWAAW: can't up more than 300th --'
 jacek: nice bg pic
 MAWAAW: score 23,54 boss 30,58
 eulerscheZahl: this gold bosses is one of the easier ones. 350 players in legend already, i can't recall having such a huge one before
 Miki09: Time for submit
 aCat: hi, anyone knows how much of legend will be recomputed?
 Miki09: top 100
 aCat: sure knowledge&#160;:&gt;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, 100
 aCat: thx euler
 eulerscheZahl: i'm more trustworthy than Miki09
 aCat: sorry Miki but yes
 HoriMiyamura: you guys mean only top 100 recomputed?
 HoriMiyamura: how about the lower?
 Miki09:&#160;:-(
 HoriMiyamura: they just be there,?
 Maroly: lower are losers&#160;:(
 HoriMiyamura: what if top 100 lose too much will they be pushed to 101
 Miki09: How to avoid @&amp;]\@&amp;!!! shielded spiders who just go and destroy ur base?
 Maroly: control enemy heros before they shield
 eulerscheZahl: beat them up until they die
 Miki09: thx
 ItsNotABug: More defencing heros, manage spider distance based on turns to kill, control spiders away from your base before they get shielded. Few options
 ItsNotABug: Or just kill enemy base before spiders overwhelm you
 Miki09: thx
 struct: Did not hit play my code limit once
 struct: this should be an achievement
 cegprakash: I won't be surprised if the postmortem of top players comes to 4 pages
 struct: lol
 HoriMiyamura: haha you encourage dev to not test
 cegprakash: I have 1600 lines of code full of if elses
 HoriMiyamura: what if some of the top player use NN or someth Algos, that's would be a big supprise
 struct: nope
 struct: no NNs
 Miki09: why?
 struct: Because I dont see recurse at rank 1
 Miki09: lol
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 Miki09: why she is not there?
 HoriMiyamura: maybe he just too lazy at this time
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Switched_on_Loops">https://thedailywtf.com/articles/Switched_on_Loops</a>
 HoriMiyamura: it is amzing on what dev could do
 HoriMiyamura: good job switch for mechanism
 struct: Im going to try the triple wind
 struct: shame
 cegprakash: guys my rank is 69
 Miki09: struct lol
 Miki09: I tried that twice and still no results...
 struct: still very early
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/631222960">https://www.codingame.com/replay/631222960</a>
 struct: not much time
 eulerscheZahl: that nonsense is your strategy? then no congrats for legend
 eulerscheZahl: i hate those opponents
 struct: no
 struct: my strategy was 2
 struct: LOL
 struct: and the worst part is that I dont even use math to check where I need to do the first wind to bring it closer
 struct: I just brute force 360 angles
 mlomb: euler you wont like mine then&#160;:(
 ItsNotABug: Oh no, what happened to Djak? He was top&#160;:'( 
 struct: triple wind almost at top 5
 struct: lol
 cegprakash: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 cegprakash: not like this
 cegprakash: not on the last day
 Miki09: my new code #456 in gold...
 jrke: cegprakash i faced that yesterday
 cegprakash: good morning jrke
 jrke: good morning
 cegprakash: for me it's just night
 cegprakash: even tho it's 11AM
 cegprakash: my eyes are already red
 jrke: lol
 cegprakash: anything for a T shirt
 struct: I knew my fantastic bits code would be useful
 Waffle3z: gold 76, submitting again
 struct: gl Waffle3z
 Zandy156: 2 submit of the contest, probably my last. I usually do like 10 submits. 
 Waffle3z: following monsters deeper into the opponent's base rather than just blowing them closer from the edge made a difference
 Waffle3z: saw somebody shield a monster near the edge so that it couldn't be controlled or blown into the base and would walk out of bounds
 jrke: i have a 90% feeling that my current IDE bot is better than arena but hesitating a lot while going to click on that submit button
 Zandy156: my experience shows it rarely is better if I'm unsure
 Zandy156: but it can be hard to tell when there are a lot of strategies at every rank
 IvesL: old bot, cant beat boss, top1000, new bot beat boss 90%, drop 500
 yhyoxx: classic
 jrke: i pushed 2 people in legend:neutral_face:
 yhyoxx: god bless you
 IvesL: @jrke you should just get further 20points to have a global points of 88888
 jrke: :grin:
 jrke: yhyoxx i hope god blesses me with legend
 yhyoxx: the cg gods are reading 
 jrke: looks like legend is possible if i push another person in legend
 jrke: :smiley:
 IvesL: 0.6 with remaining game
 yhyoxx: ill be that person
 yhyoxx: any idea why same code submitted twice gives very different scores&#160;?
 IvesL: good luck
 Miki09: Imma travel 88mph in a delorean to get back to yesterday and have more time to get to legend league. See you back in future
 jrke: yhyoxx LUCK and submission by  many peoples at same time
 yhyoxx: i hope it's not mostly luck
 yhyoxx: otherwise what am i doing here&#160;?
 jrke: damn 2 more got pushed in legend
 jrke: not just due to me due to me and another person
 cegprakash: any wind spammers in legend
 Murat_Eroglu: Where we're going we don't need roads
 yhyoxx: i know one of them haha
 cegprakash: I need to test something
 eulerscheZahl: wait, jrke is not in legend?
 eulerscheZahl: weren't you top10 on wednesday?
 jrke: exams :rage:
 jrke: i was but got pushed back a lot
 jrke: cegprakash i pushed one wind spammer in legend just rn
 eulerscheZahl: i always have the impression that you Indians take exams very seriously
 cegprakash: what's his name jrke
 Waffle3z: 62% gold rank 4, hopefully I can sit and wait until I get pushed in
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/631254160">https://www.codingame.com/replay/631254160</a>
 jrke: cegprakash ^
 jrke: weird name
 eulerscheZahl: i understand why you didn'T spell it out
 Waffle3z: oh now I'm rank 1. well hopefully I stay here by the time progress hits 100%
 Miki09: Congrats&#160;:-)
 struct: grats
 struct: I'm so tired
 struct: My body can't handle this anymore
 BenjaminUrquhart: I literally just want ot leave silver
 BenjaminUrquhart: to*
 struct: I just want this to end :p
 BenjaminUrquhart: same but I want to end in gold
 Miki09: I want to end in legend...
 BenjaminUrquhart: that's my goal for every contest, get at least gold
 yhyoxx: let's go jrke rank 1
 Miki09: Off hope is last to die!!!

 yhyoxx: legends should stream
 cegprakash: my eyes are red
 cegprakash: can't stream lul
 eulerscheZahl: stream what?
 yhyoxx: on twitch
 yhyoxx: themselves coding
 yhyoxx: too risky&#160;?
 cegprakash: actually legends are not supposed to stream as per rules
 eulerscheZahl: me coding is as interesting as watching wet color dry
 yhyoxx: but very informative
 DEV-thien: :slight_smile:
 cegprakash: there is a corner case I'm trying to cover and I watched over 40 replays and the code is not reachable at all
 cegprakash: should I cover that case
 eulerscheZahl: for this particular game i don't think you would learn that much from streams
 yhyoxx: ive been watching resistcorp yesterday morning
 yhyoxx: 200th silver
 yhyoxx: simulating and stuff
 yhyoxx: very cool
 IvesL: where to check global leaderboard for overall ranking?
 eulerscheZahl: psyho streamed a lot
 cegprakash: can someone in legend find a flaw in my game
 Waffle3z: if I do hit legend it won't be by much, keep jumping between above boss and 5th
 yhyoxx: yes psyho's stream is cool too
 cegprakash: @Blodis: Blodis failed a CONTROL: Entity 78 is not within range of Hero 5

 struct: Its not looking bad
 struct: my ide vs arena
 yhyoxx: pretty good
 yhyoxx: like shooting a shotgun
 Waffle3z: wonder where boss 5 would place in legend
 Jainam123: how to learn coding
 struct: practice 
 eulerscheZahl: Pbatch is the boss, currently at 223
 struct: But same bot?
 eulerscheZahl: and by the date he didn't even submit after legend opening
 struct: oh
 Waffle3z: legend has 377 and the boss is 223 and you only get in legend by beating the boss
 eulerscheZahl: yes. i don't see a problem with that sentence
 eulerscheZahl: Neuman n made a pretty good prediction on the 29th already"I call 350-400 by the end of the contest"
 yhyoxx: and u said blasterpoard ends first
 eulerscheZahl: yes i did say so
 Patrick_Starfish: how do you know where the boss places in legend
 struct: oh trictrac also made it, grats
 HoriMiyamura: is this true that only top 100 will get recompute
 HoriMiyamura: others in legend isn't?
 eulerscheZahl: was min(legend, top100) the last times
 HoriMiyamura: will there becase that some of the top 100 be pushed to 101 or lower?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure how those corner cases will be handled. but those ranks are probably not be considered that important
 eulerscheZahl: it's mainly to get a stable ranking at the very top
 HoriMiyamura: thanks
 Jainam123: i know the basic but cant solve this what i do
 HoriMiyamura: I am 90 before but now 103
 HoriMiyamura: no need to recomputed :D
 eulerscheZahl: checking chat logs now...
 eulerscheZahl: cegprakash: what happen to eulerscheZahl
 Jainam123: can any one help me
 eulerscheZahl: not hiding, that #3 bot ended up #70 on resubmit
 HoriMiyamura: haha
 eulerscheZahl: so damn random
 yhyoxx: re submit again
 Waffle3z: trueskill, more like falseskill
 yhyoxx: i think if ur rank is high and submit 
 HoriMiyamura: the point is most of our code are deterministic
 yhyoxx: if u lose u get thrown too low
 HoriMiyamura: but the result are quite random
 yhyoxx: if ur rank is low
 yhyoxx: not so much
 Patrick_Starfish: do you actually have access to the bot code 
 eulerscheZahl: to which bot code?
 Patrick_Starfish: any of them 
 eulerscheZahl: only your own
 Patrick_Starfish: i mean the boss code
 eulerscheZahl: wood bosses are publicly available on github
 eulerscheZahl: later ones: no
 Patrick_Starfish: ok
 Jainam123: Can any one guide me&gt;
 Jainam123:&#160;?
 IvesL: jesus could
 Jainam123: :confused:
 IvesL: be your sheperd
 IvesL: whats your problem
 Jainam123: i know the basic of programming but when i came here i cant solve problems what i do
 IvesL: go play clash of codes
 Jainam123: but the thing is i cant solve that problems
 IvesL: even if you cant finish, you can see others' when times over
 Jainam123: oh
 IvesL: it doesnt matter
 Jainam123: I will try
 Jainam123: tx
 IvesL: just try to understand why they code in that way
 Jainam123: ok
 cegprakash: An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time.".
 cegprakash: this is like 10th time today
 cegprakash: CG plz plz consider increasing testing limit
 yhyoxx: also happens when u replay in same conditions&#160;?
 cegprakash: I don't wanna play in same conditions
 struct: same seed and same players are sent to your ide
 IvesL: i wanna ask a question, usually how many hours are needed for you guys to make one legend league solution
 yamo: was there a lot of hiding in legend&#160;?
 Cr3aHal0: keep going guys
 Valdemar: went to bed, woke up in first place :smile: Actually I don't believe in it, there's really bad winrates versus several top players. But still satisfying
 mlomb: well, time to reveal a strat I didnt see anyone else use
 mlomb: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/631258491">https://www.codingame.com/replay/631258491</a>
 Quentin_le_magnifique: How did you inst awin this?!
 mlomb:&#160;;)
 Mazelcop: oh, smart&#160;!
 yhyoxx: whaaat
 mlomb: it came to me yestarday so not a facny impl&#160;:(
 mlomb: yesterday*
 Whatar: so you controlled the monster before winding and then they crawled to the enemy based while outside?
 abt8601: wow this is so good
 yhyoxx: very cool
 mlomb: you only get information about entities in y &lt; 9000
 Whatar: very impressive
 mlomb: so you can point them to go up and then wind them down
 mlomb: below the map but not too far to be despawned
 Valdemar: wow, nice strat mlomb
 SashaNukem: do you need to win every one in the lobby to get to the boss?
 raxkin: btw awesome job yamo. Have been following you from scala section, and you did a great final push!
 kovi: blaster toyed weith that early
 mlomb: didnt know, what came out out of it?
 mlomb: my def is very bad unfortunately
 kovi: he switched to doubleattacker
 kovi: also seems that anti-2/3 protects vs. this
 mlomb: i couldnt win blaster no matter what
 kovi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/631316701">https://www.codingame.com/replay/631316701</a>
 mlomb: yup
 BenjaminUrquhart: 50 minutes left, it's late for me so I'm probably just gonna submit what I have and see where it lands
 BenjaminUrquhart: it doesn't beat my old bot since I somehow made grinding worse but from random games I've pulled in it seems to do overall better
 Quentin_le_magnifique: How can you try your bot gainst the one of one of your friend?
 cegprakash: below IDE
 cegprakash: select the player
 Quentin_le_magnifique: Okay thanks!&#160;;)
 klasak: how many battles do you play in each level? i thought 150 but it is not the case
 struct: I think 100 per submit?
 aCat: yyy
 struct: you might get more if other players are also submiting
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the league
 aCat: I got 74 and 44%
 MyNameIsTrez: I really hope we can still get gold after the timer is up and it just stops us from submitting
 cegprakash: how many if statements do u guys have 
 cegprakash: I've 191 ifs
 Zyk0: 199
 MyNameIsTrez: 18
 Whatar: if + elif = 65 for me
 MyNameIsTrez: But I spent like three days on designing my code to be as if-free as possible which was not worth
 abt8601: 32 if/else if/match
 Whatar: well you could have spended three days debugging a mess like I did
 cegprakash: I wonder how many ifs blasterpoard has
 Butanium: hi
 Butanium: has anyone here reach more than top 500 gold without attacking the opponent&#160;?
 jrke: cegprakash i think blaster is having sim kinda search
 cegprakash: I doubt that
 aCat: 6 polish people in top 30&#160;;]
 aCat: 5 from our uni
 aCat: :P
 Illedan: Nice
 Illedan: Wish I had time for such madness :P
 cegprakash: where were u Illedan
 Illedan: On a trip
 aCat: yeah I should sleep finally
 cegprakash: missed ur GA
 Illedan: Company weekend
 Illedan: With room sharing, so I couldn't code all night
 aCat: been like &gt;26hours
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like dbdr is gonna make it
 Butanium: dbdr use NN right N
 Butanium: *rigt&#160;?
 Butanium: * right&#160;?
 dbdr: 200 lines of code written entirely this morning
 eulerscheZahl: 200 NN lines
 yamo: thanks raxkin&#160;!
 dbdr: :D
 Butanium: lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok submitting and yolo
 eulerscheZahl: NN code generated by another NN
 Butanium: that's impressive
 dbdr: iNNception
 eulerscheZahl: iNNceptioNN
 eulerscheZahl: i think i throw the towel
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like the double barrelled shotgun routine is the winner
 Butanium: I lost my chance to go to legend the moment I decided not to attack xD
 cegprakash: last min submit bowwowforeach
 BenjaminUrquhart: hold up I'm finding crashes in my submit, pain
 Butanium: o
 Butanium: dbdr my AI counters yours
 Butanium: lol
 aCat: so many last submits
 aCat: xD
 Illedan: Yeah, please stop. I need this last 20 min to test a lot of stuff
 aCat: yeah half of legend is computing
 pydlv: I just started working on this a couple hours ago
 Illedan: xD
 pydlv: I got to mid silver league
 PatrickMcGinnisII: need a race horse announcer
 Butanium: ok I had a timeout issue
 cegprakash: 19 mins before I go out and have a drink
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Japan getting edged out by the slavs... around the 3 turn comes a rust NN
 Miki09: Damn I was 330 in gold and now with same code Im 460... The last submit wasnt a good idea...
 Butanium: 19 minutes before touching grass guys
 cegprakash: if I get any last min heart break i.e. rank 100+ I'll be super disappointed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The GAs are in the paddock still trying to drug their horses
 struct: I dont even know why im still awake
 cegprakash: what time is it struct
 yhyoxx: same
 struct: 08:42am
 cegprakash: it's 1PM here..
 struct: you didnt sleep?
 cegprakash: my eyes are red
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the mini-sims are laughing at the Heuristic hippies
 BenjaminUrquhart: 3:42 am
 Miki09: 9:42 am
 HoriMiyamura: a few mins..
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and rednecks are are the star of the party with their shotgun weddings
 Westicles: rerunning all of legend
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'll figure out shotgun strats when the multi comes out
 struct: Anyways I'm glad it's over for me
 struct: Most painful contest I have played
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was trying to figure out why they added the 4 spots on the battles.
 cegprakash: what did it cost struct
 struct: my sanity 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: his ban hammer has a crack in it

 eulerminer: What happens with the ranking and scores that are not stable yet when the contest ends? I mean, in 15mins
 aCat: haha no way I have strength to write about this&#160;;-)
 struct: "we’ll rerun the entire Legend league"
 eulerscheZahl: After all matches are finished playing, we’ll rerun the entire Legend league. We’ll also do a check for cheaters. Then only, the ranking will be final.
 aCat: but before all things finish to compute
 Butanium: wait only legend&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, struct faster
 struct: yes aCat
 aCat: from lowest leagues so that people can advance
 Butanium: oh ok
 IvesL: how to define cheaters
 eulerminer: What about other leagues?
 eulerscheZahl: compare codes
 IvesL: similarity of codes?
 eulerscheZahl: some copy from leaked github
 Butanium: are we supposed to keep our github repo private&#160;?
 eulerminer: Thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: haven't checked. but search for spring challenge 2022 on github. limit to activity in the last week. you will find a few
 Butanium: mine is public
 struct: yes lol
 eulerscheZahl: if someone copied your bot, you can get disqualified over this
 Butanium: oh
 IvesL: btw, are there any plans renaming contests under bot programming section? 
 BenjaminUrquhart: I'm geting captchas fixing these crashes, pain
 IvesL: i feel like the photosynthesis deserve a name
 eulerscheZahl: sounds unlikely to me IvesL
 IvesL: thats sad
 mframbou: Will cheaters be disqualified after ranking or will they keep their positions&#160;?
 Butanium: do we get notified if we get disqualified euler&#160;?
 Spalmon: will arena games continue after time is up?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea Butanium, i never got DQed
 pydlv: anyone know obama's last name?
 Butanium: Spalmon all current subimission will be finished
 BenjaminUrquhart: ok this is my final submit, whatever happened happens
 eulerscheZahl: but you won't show up on the leaderboard anymore, obvious sign
 Butanium: yes ok
 eulerscheZahl: let's take a snapshot of the leaderboard and see whom we lost, shall we?
 IvesL: what will you name this game?
 IvesL: spider rush?
 struct: Spring Challenge 2022
 aCat: how original
 aCat: this cat is amazed
 big_rooster_energy: what happens in 7 minutes do submissions get paused?
 cegprakash: "With greater spider sense comes greater responsibility"
 Westicles: Peasant Heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: all submissions will finish first
 eulerscheZahl: including promotions and submits in the next higher league
 big_rooster_energy: oh good i have a small chance to advance to legend then
 eulerscheZahl: then rerun of legend
 IvesL: spider mad: no way home
 big_rooster_energy: thank you for explaining i was worried i would not get the chance
 cegprakash: that moment when a buggy bot has better win rate than non buggy one and I've to go with the buggy one 
 BenjaminUrquhart: mood
 yhyoxx: u know how every contest when it's done, it becomes a puzzle, and at the bottom they write the category of the puzzle, last two, one was minimax, the other mtcs, what do u think this one will be&#160;? 
 therealbeef: Heuristics of Might and Magic
 yhyoxx: haha
 aCat: if might or magic?
 Spalmon: cegprakash literally same
 IvesL: heuristics, optimization
 eulerscheZahl: multi-agent
 cegprakash: it's awkward isn't it Spalmon
 IvesL: i think it should share a lot with fantastic bits
 cegprakash: I have barely blinked in last 12 hrs
 struct: It will Finite State Machine

 Westicles: no titans in wood2, guess it won't happen
 eulerminer: Is your rank computed in the next league if you get promoted in 5 minutes?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 IvesL: i think so
 eulerminer: Thanks!
 cegprakash: 451 ppl computing right now
 eulerscheZahl: even if you submit now and it gets promoted at the end of the submit in 1h, you will still play the higher league
 cegprakash: last 2 minutes
 struct: it will take hours before recalc starts
 cegprakash: panic submitters now is ur time
 cegprakash: GG all
 cegprakash: had an amazing week
 eulerminer: Awesome
 eulerscheZahl: the first detailed post mortem already
 aCat: no way, im ~36 and top 50 is my best goal
 eulerscheZahl: "Cracking the seed (in 1 turn)"
 cegprakash: bad thing is I gotta go to work from tomorrow
 aCat: ane our uni did amazing job
 IvesL: last minute
 Spalmon: i hope my code is good enough for promotion :fearful:
 IvesL: blasterpoard vs bowwowforeach
 Spalmon: this submission is so much higher stakes than all the others
 aCat: I remember times when there was no competition in university rankings
 rcrl: We can blink now
 rcrl: Have a nice day it was a pleasure

 struct: if your submit is still going
 Yanek: that's good to hear :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl is gonna go up on general leaderboard me thinks
 kingSelom: now that the contest has ended, how do i find the challenge again? just wanted to continue playing with it
 BenjaminUrquhart: gotta wait
 BenjaminUrquhart: also 460 people computing atm
 big_rooster_energy: i think they re-release it later this week
 kingSelom: ok
 eulerscheZahl: "eulerscheZahl is gonna go up on general leaderboard me thinks"why?

 eulerscheZahl: activities =&gt; compete =&gt; leaderboard
 IvesL: alright thanks
 jrke: kingSelom CG will release game soon
 jrke: oh damn this chat
 eulerscheZahl: pydlv we don't publicly share code here
 jrke: i didn't scrolled up till down
 eulerscheZahl: "As the challenge game will be released soon as a classic game on the platform, please don’t share your code publicly."<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736</a>
 MrCryptton: awesome, thank you eulerscheZahl&#160;!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gonna sell shotgun code, lol
 Q12: but this report will be updated if your submit is still running, yeah?
 Q12: like in the place you have reached
 JohnyDaison: yup, I keep refreshing and hoping&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, the rank will update
 Whatar: gg everyone
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm, decay on contest cp
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so if I figure right, being in top 1k should generate 3k cp?
 eulerscheZahl: HoriMiyamura with a broken bot. why?
 Westicles: BbYy also
 eulerscheZahl: maybe scared of cheat detection, who knows
 eulerscheZahl: my website doesn't handle nickname changes&#160;:(<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?user=4070745">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?user=4070745</a>
 eulerscheZahl: still showing the old name
 struct: Seems like we have a awinner
 struct: Big lead to 2nd place
 struct: oh not over
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait for recalc. but looks impressive
 aCat: o,g&#160;? 2 points, nice
 struct: rank 4 is beating him
 struct: 2/2
 jrke: a confimed winner? that also without recurse in contest? 
 struct: 4/5*
 eulerscheZahl: and with a few others in submit too, the opponent selection is not uniform now
 struct: yeah
 struct: I finally placed above recurse 
 struct: I peaked 
 eulerscheZahl: i might place below cegprakash
 aCat: did he even participate?
 struct: not that we know of
 aCat: ;p
 eulerscheZahl: then it doesn't count as beating him
 aCat: yeah
 aCat: formally you dont have higher score because he does not have score
 jrke: recalc will be for top 100 right?
 eulerscheZahl: all legend
 jrke: ah oki
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736</a>After all matches are finished playing, we’ll rerun the entire Legend league. We’ll also do a check for cheaters. Then only, the ranking will be final.
 eulerscheZahl: Next event: not yet announced. Stay tuned.
 struct: I dont think I'll write a pm, I don't have anything to say.
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 eulerscheZahl: same struct
 eulerscheZahl: HoriMiyamura why the broken submit?
 jrke: shouldn't they first check for cheaters then rerun?
 HoriMiyamura: I have 2 accounts
 eulerscheZahl: that would be the better order
 HoriMiyamura: so I let the other alive this time
 eulerscheZahl: you love trouble, don't you?
 [CG]Thibaud: :eyes:
 HoriMiyamura: :D
 HoriMiyamura: well,&#160;:(
 Insufficient: what do you need 2 accounts for? to have an unfair advantage on testing and submit limits? because you're not good enough to go toe to toe?
 BenjaminUrquhart: I have 3 accounts, 2 of which didn't enter the contest&#160;:)
 aCat: my LOCM entered gold&#160;:(
 aCat: I didn't nerf him enough and bam, he advanced
 mlomb: LOCM?
 aCat: should be somewhere bottom now, 
 eulerscheZahl: accidentally promoting because you are just too good even if you try not to. common problem
 aCat: ;p
 struct: Yeap I had this problem the entire contest
 eulerscheZahl: his 2nd account he created for the LOCM contest
 aCat: and for streams / showing people things on CG, etc
 eulerscheZahl: right
 jrke: this is the biggest contest of CG till now right?
 eulerscheZahl: it is
 jrke: biggest in terms of participants
 aCat: i suppose soe but I;m not good at adding numbers
 HoriMiyamura: my intend is just hide the other
 [CG]Thibaud: it is the biggest yes
 eulerscheZahl: congrats on gathering so many players again. well done
 aCat: Thib, you see how our uni did
 aCat: :heart_eyes_cat:
 Aeneas: Where is Recurse&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: lots of familiar names coming from all corners
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't check school leaderboard tbh
 BenjaminUrquhart: recurse retired
 Aeneas: awww&#160;:/
 aCat: probably hardest fight ever
 struct: still not over aCat
 aCat: i know
 Aeneas: I found this game very fun and complex&#160;!
 eulerscheZahl: hardest fight by what metric?
 aCat: but we have some good results here
 Westicles: I wonder if all these Japanese guys at the top played it before?
 aCat: like most of the time we wre not first, and even this morning we were winning like 200 points
 eulerscheZahl: i don't think so. there are some very competitive Japanese players (here and also on topcoder)
 eulerscheZahl: they just don't chat much. partially because of the language barrier
 [CG]Thibaud: they chat on Twitter ^^
 eulerscheZahl: oh, fight on school leaderboard?
 aCat: yeah
 IvesL: perhaps can google in japanese and find their presence
 eulerscheZahl: and post long writeups on hatenablog
 eulerscheZahl: i occasionally stalk some of them on twitter. also to see what contests are about to start
 struct: terry is very active on twitter
 CookieMonsterXL: Can we still see our code and play other players?
 eulerscheZahl: wait until it will be moved to multiplayer section. then you can play again
 JohnyDaison: you can see your code right now though, in the report
 struct: I can see my code but I prefer not look at it ever again
 eulerscheZahl: i might just find bugs and be sad
 BenjaminUrquhart: isn't that how it is for everyone
 BenjaminUrquhart: I fixed a bug 20 seconds before contest end
 struct: no
 struct: I dont even loooked for bugs
 struct: I have no idea what my bot does
 eulerscheZahl: there is a bug right in your spelling :P
 struct: you are right
 eulerscheZahl: still awake?
 eulerscheZahl: get some rest
 struct: Then my sleep schedule will be a mess
 jrke: my first legend in contest!
 eulerscheZahl: you promoted last-minute jrke?
 eulerscheZahl: congrats!
 struct: grats
 jrke: not last minute but in last hour
 jrke: some good guys pushed me from top gold to legend
 eulerscheZahl: recent enough to still congratulate
 jrke: thnx!
 kingSelom: My second contest and still silver, how do i get prepare for next one? any recommendations
 aCat: bronze already finished computing&#160;;]
 wlesavo: grats dbdr, last minute submit to legend :slight_smile:
 dbdr: from zero to legend in 4 hours&#160;:)
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 dbdr: well, I knew the rules and I had the data structures
 Westicles: I wonder if they'll fix the seed before making it a bot problem
 abt8601: You mean seed cracking?
 Westicles: yeah, use the secure one
 abt8601: :thinking_face:
 BenjaminUrquhart: doubt it
 abt8601: But seriously, using a LCG in this scenario sounds like a recipe for disaster
 jacek: people are abusing the seed?
 eulerscheZahl: check forum
 eulerscheZahl: first post mortem
 jrke: seed cracking i think is not kind of unfair maybe its just another strategy ig
 BenjaminUrquhart: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/2">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/2</a>
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted to stop the bugs from moving is see if any opponent crashes on unexpected input. but CG fixed it already&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: oh, nice profile pic<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/profile/2697bac58257106ef057fd1d9c899f9a777765">https://www.codingame.com/profile/2697bac58257106ef057fd1d9c899f9a777765</a>
 IvesL: top5 is unexpected at last
 eulerscheZahl: still very much undecided at the top
 IvesL: very close
 IvesL: keeps changing slightly
 BenjaminUrquhart: my results are in, my old bot would probably have been better, oh well
 Yanek: yuss, got promoted to legend at 96% battles
 Valdemar: heuristics got very high (2nd in JS), quite balanced game this time 
 IvesL: valdemar how many lines have you got
 dbdr: congrats Yanek
 kovi: 400 in legend
 Yanek: thanks! :D
 struct: grats
 jrke: so there will be exact 400 in legend
 jrke: cause ongoing submissions says that no one is near to legend atm
 Valdemar: IvesL around 1.5k, including self-written data structures (vec2, fixed_vector instead of std::vector) and several usused functions
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like someone is optimizing for fast code
 Husenap: well played to everyone, it was a few very exciting days towards the end
 dbdr: Valdemar what kind of search do you use?
 Valdemar: bruteforce for 4 turn
 Valdemar: only for attacker
 eulerscheZahl: limited set of moves?
 eulerscheZahl: like going between a spider and a certain point, fixed distance
 Valdemar: yes, 8 direction + wait + wind to enemy base + control
 eulerscheZahl: ah, i see
 kovi: nice
 eulerscheZahl: tried the same (less depth) but couldn't get it to work properly. maybe bad scoring function
 aCat: ill you write a postmortem?
 aCat: I had search for my triple cannon final phase
 Valdemar: I guess i'll write pm this timedidn't expect it climb so high
 aCat: but abondoned the strategy
 aCat: yeah, please do
 JuliusA: I'd love to read that postmortem!Oh, and congratulations!&#160;:)
 DjTrilogic: are simulations over&#160;?
 big_rooster_energy: i hope they rerun gold too&#160;:)
 aCat: still 14 computing
 aCat: and then legend rerun...
 abt8601: But silver and below are done
 Valdemar: eulerscheZahl in friday difference between top-100 gold and top-10 legend was only in scoring function, so it matters very much in my solution, especially because of small depth 
 DjTrilogic: i think it would be more fair to run equal number of fights for all players
 Valdemar: DjTrilogic whole legend will be recalculated with hundred matches
 struct: run for 7.7k players?
 DjTrilogic: what about gold&#160;?
 struct: What if people got promoted after recalc?
 struct: do we recalc again if it happens
 jrke: while no_one_promoted:
 jrke: :grinning:
 DragonOfTheWest: bruv rofl
 big_rooster_energy: a lot of people submitted at the last minute making the promotions irregular, a number of those people who went gold to legend just now are top100
 JuliusA: xD
 abt8601: Looks like an ungodly amount of time
 DragonOfTheWest: ^ problem with high gold is that people that didn't choose offense now counter pretty much the entirety of legend
 DragonOfTheWest: because legend consists only of double and tripple canons lul
 elurisoto: I think I may have a chance to get to legend if there's a recalc for gold
 Insufficient: no, legend is a mix of 0/1/2/3 attackers
 Darleanow: hello guys
 Darleanow: where can i find the weekly puzzle&#160;?
 DragonOfTheWest: just 6 more computing, and then another recalculation @Valdemar
 DragonOfTheWest:&#160;?
 struct: yes
 struct: Is it 500 battles per player?
 DragonOfTheWest: 500????
 DomiKo: struct have you seen?
 jrke: yeah last recalc had 500 battles
 jrke: SC21
 VizGhar: guys?... no immediate invitation to next contest&#160;:|
 struct: seen what DomiKo?
 DomiKo: my result went down ...
 DomiKo: by a lot&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: as stated on the forum VizGhar
 struct: yeah&#160;:/
 struct: I saw that
 struct: you were 10th at some point
 VizGhar: forum? going to check
 VizGhar: "Next event: not yet announced. Stay tuned."
 VizGhar: what can we expect?&#160;:(
 struct: They lose a few instant signups by not having it ready
 aCat: yeah 
 abt8601: Was SC22 ready when FC21 ended?
 aCat: FC21 was notexistent
 struct: Im talking about the page to signup, not the contest
 wlesavo: 1 computing :slight_smile: is it silver to legend submit?
 aCat: lol
 struct: SC22 was ready by the time SC2019 finished
 aCat: sc22 was ready in 2018
 aCat:&#160;:/
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 aCat: id like this t be a joke 
 struct: please no more fog contests&#160;:'(
 PatrickMcGinnisII: um, yea... no
 struct: I suffered too much
 Westicles: turn the taco bot on before he starts swearing
 wlesavo: make it frog contest
 abt8601: So are imperfect information games uncommon on this platform?
 struct: no
 eulerscheZahl: are we all watching Egaro555 now?
 struct: There are people that love them, I hate them
 jrke: yess eulerscheZahl
 jrke: :grinning:
 eulerscheZahl: hurry up Egaro
 struct: I hate  the games, not the people
 Egaro555:&#160;:) 
 Husenap: dang look at that win streak
 cegprakash: I want that streak in my first 10 games
 VizGhar: (and in all others)
 Husenap: true :P 
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/5m8WSN3pYzLM">https://prnt.sc/5m8WSN3pYzLM</a>
 jrke: contest ended at 1:30 in indian time
 eulerscheZahl: late promotion
 VizGhar: heh
 jrke: very late
 cegprakash: celebrity of the day Egaro555
 kovi: could be worsea troll bot from bronze, winning all games but still taking 200 turn and 50ms
 eulerscheZahl: plan for next contest: from bronze to legend. just to annoy everyone
 Egaro555: Finish :smile:
 eulerscheZahl: started
 jrke: :smiley:
 Husenap: lol
 jrke: time for recalc!
 jrke: atb to everyone!
 eulerscheZahl: looked automated, as it started so fast
 [CG]Thibaud: it is
 wlesavo: choose your fighter :smiley:
 ddreams: nice, got to legend with my last minute push
 DomiKo: grats!
 struct: grats
 ddreams: thx&#160;:)
 struct: Im out for a few hours, need to get some rest
 ddreams: my second child was born on wednesday, so didn't have much time this contest :D
 jrke: wow gratz!
 Husenap: that's the real win
 DomiKo: 2x grats!!!
 VizGhar: grats ddreams
 abt8601: congrats
 cegprakash: no recalc? just extra games?
 yhyoxx: congrats&#160;!!
 eulerscheZahl: that is the recalc
 jrke: cegprakash thats recalc
 eulerscheZahl: you always kept your previous rank as seeding
 ddreams: have to work on the timing though... was 1.5 years ago since the last one (for the 2020 fall contest)
 wlesavo: cant believe top5 is so close
 jrke: i would have changed that top 3 prize to top 5 prize
 aCat: and tshirts form top20 to top 50 pr 100
 aCat: CG had twice or troiple less participants yars ago
 cclaude42: Anyone know how long it usually takes for recalcs n stuff&#160;?
 cclaude42: Impatient to know the final results!
 eulerscheZahl: and who pays the prizes?
 eulerscheZahl: can take 4 hours
 jrke: cclaude42 maybe 4-5 hours?
 abt8601: cclaude42 They also have to check for cheaters so I guess it may take days
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eww, 2 are negative
 eulerscheZahl: usually it's less players when it takes 4 hours. but also more search-heavy bots. so these effects might cancel out
 Westicles: how did CaptainHamburger end up at bottom?
 cclaude42: Dope, thanks!
 Westicles: he was like 15 at one point
 DomiKo: btw exactly 400 people in legend :D
 DomiKo: Hambuger is doing "WAIT" all the time now
 eulerscheZahl: why would anyone cripple their bot that hard?
 aCat: I can pay for prizes for myself&#160;;]
 DomiKo: euler idk
 eulerscheZahl: hiding and forgetting when the contest ends?
 jrke: are CG staff also going to get removed from final leaderboard??:smiley:
 VizGhar: Now I'm sad I didn't invest a little bit more time into it&#160;:) stopped when reached legend
 eulerscheZahl: when spending many hours on that bot, i wouldn't break it at the end
 wlesavo: Could he also have 2 accs?
 eulerscheZahl: no jrke, why should they?
 abt8601: eulerscheZahl One of them said they have an alt so they sabotaged one of them and kept the alt alive
 jrke: was just curious to know
 eulerscheZahl: yes i saw that
 Husenap: but CG could probably check history
 Westicles: oh brother.  the top american I was rooting for was a Japanese smurf or something
 jrke: suppose accidentally one of them got in top 20?
 eulerscheZahl: but an alt in top20?
 eulerscheZahl: time to write your own bots to root for, Westicles?
 ddreams: reminds me of the tetris competition.. my last entry had a fatal bug so it ended in bottom of legend
 VizGhar: westicles change your country to something exotic and youlll be first
 [CG]Thibaud: no way we get into top 20. I guess we would avoid entering top 100
 eulerscheZahl: tetris? do you mean puyo-puyo (smash the code)?
 jrke: ohh cool nicee
 [CG]Thibaud: I was 100 on Saturday morning :grinning:
 cegprakash: I don't like how the recalc is going so far fo me -_- losing streak
 jrke: :smile:
 ddreams: I guess so
 aCat: sundey morning 2018 ;p
 Westicles: VizGhar, nice I didn't realize I won my country
 DragonOfTheWest: same @ceg
 eulerscheZahl: you put in a lot of effort to organize a contest and make everyone happy. i don't see anything wrong in you enjoying the event yourself by writing bots too
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah, I like those games
 Husenap: maybe they already have too much merch and don't want more xD 
 aCat: can we get some fresh one next time Thib,&#160;?
 VizGhar: Or can we make one?&#160;:)
 [CG]Thibaud: what difference does it make?
 rafaelSorel: 250 run still 8%, how many runs for the finals&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i like it a bit more on the search side. somewhere between this and the last contest. the sweet spot
 aCat: it makes
 aCat: one it is like second-handed used shirt
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII has an ouchie. :smirk:</b>
 eulerscheZahl: still nice to see a community gathering, even if it's not my strongest type of game
 aCat: two there were probably some people with advantage
 aCat: and we can make games&#160;;]
 eulerscheZahl: return of community contests?
 aCat: ehh please
 jrke: Samsung SDG's players were at top till few days ago
 jrke: SDS*
 aCat: the game was strange (other word for awful ;p) but with not a good contest from such a long time
 aCat: happy cat
 aCat: hope top 50
 aCat: this cat needs acheievement&#160;:(
 [CG]Thibaud: I don't believe players who played it in their company got a real advantage
 DragonOfTheWest: tbh the cannon strats were a bit too much imo. Would've been nice to see some kind of stack reduction on wind casts. 
 eulerscheZahl: DragonOfTheWest++
 [CG]Thibaud: there is a challenge in the making in some company. Should be open to all community
 DragonOfTheWest: just so that enemies can't triple cannon out of your vision range
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that sounds interesting Thibaud. like Crstal Rush?
 aCat: game was quite unbalanced, heavy for sims, and very meta-dependent
 jrke: does anybody also think that shielding opponent heros are sometimes beneficial?
 DomiKo: yes it is
 aCat: but the event itself was great
 DragonOfTheWest: but I do think it was an unintended game mechanic xd. Blasterpoard started it on day 4 or something I recall. 
 DragonOfTheWest: @jrke yes it is, with cannon strats rofl
 [CG]Thibaud: yup, stack wind was a bit too much. Unintended indeed
 aCat: triple cannon my love
 BenLev: hi.
 [CG]Thibaud: Also, somewhat counterable
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i snuck in the sofia labs challenge, lol
 jrke: for canon strat you have to be quick else your defense is gonna fail miserably
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah, plus stack heroes are vulnerable to winds
 Westicles: can't do it again though.  all the titans will find old hackathons now and be ready
 DragonOfTheWest: still though, the attack is just way to powerful
 DragonOfTheWest: farm mana for 30 turns, and then just tripple cannon the enemy
 DragonOfTheWest: no real counterplay except for positioning your defenders in such a way that they explore outside of your base
 DragonOfTheWest: and even then, if they attack from the "far" side (so if your x is 0, from high y), you can't counter it as well
 [CG]Thibaud: oh, and you were mentioning community challenges
 [CG]Thibaud: bot programming events appearing tehre: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/events">https://www.codingame.com/events</a> will give CP
 DomiKo: extra CP?
 [CG]Thibaud: ah sry
 [CG]Thibaud: not CP
 DragonOfTheWest: @thibaud, how easy is it to create your own custom bot like challenge like this one?
 raxkin: My strat for countering it is keep a defender near them with a shield(to avoid push back), and keep puting shields on near monsters so they can push them and also shield range &gt; push range
 DomiKo: EXP?
 [CG]Thibaud: points for contest leaderboard
 DomiKo: ohhh
 [CG]Thibaud: yeah CP ahah :upside_down:
 raxkin: Worked on some cases
 DragonOfTheWest: @raxkin, yes but also no, relies on that you actually find the attacker
 [CG]Thibaud: DragonOfTheWest not easy at all
 DomiKo: and you fixed  the issue with CP for previous contests :D
 DomiKo: Do you know how many CP points? Like for normal bot programming? 5K?
 raxkin: DragonOfTheWest yea, if i don't find the attacker fast enought i can't counter it
 DragonOfTheWest: @Thibaud im willing to give it a shot, are there any resources on it?
 jrke: DragonOfTheWest <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/create-a-multiplayer-game</a>
 DragonOfTheWest: thanks for reading my mind
 aCat: so wait, I missed some chat, there will be some open call for creating a programming game?
 [CG]Thibaud: same as challenges Domiko
 DragonOfTheWest: can you add, other languages than java though?
 aCat: kotlin
 DragonOfTheWest: then*
 5DN1L: "than" is correct
 DragonOfTheWest: oh
 DragonOfTheWest: im dumb, nice
 VizGhar: you can go with kotlin&#160;:) the SDK works with maven, so you can import necessary kotlin dependencies
 DragonOfTheWest: but can you also, for custom games, support c++?
 jrke: i wanted to create a multi player game so i learnt java only that much which was needed to make
 eulerscheZahl: aCat i think it's about "events". such as the puzzle of the week, just for bots
 VizGhar: what you mean custom games? If it have viewer, it is implemented in Java/Kotlin
 eulerscheZahl: i know this is planned. but not a real contest
 VizGhar: *has
 DomiKo: but it will add CP points to "contest leaderboard"
 Westicles: So they'll use existing ones or only new ones?
 eulerscheZahl: correct me when i'm wrong. i'd love to be wrong
 eulerscheZahl: a contest is not just (or not even mainly) about CP
 eulerscheZahl: new game, fixed timeline, lots of players
 VizGhar: Just wait for official statement :P
 eulerscheZahl: ok
 eulerscheZahl: does Viz know more? :thinking:
 Westicles: I bet it will be old ones... connect4 and whatnot
 [CG]Thibaud: yes, community games
 DomiKo: more players will play those games, so cool
 jrke: after long i am watching D&amp;B replays
 jrke: there was a time when i just spent whole days on it
 jrke: :grimacing:
 DragonOfTheWest: @thibaud, when you create the custom game, can you use any language when playing it or just Java?
 [CG]Thibaud: I'm not particularly fond of this. But it means&#160;:- more visibility to some nice community games- contest-like experience (or close)
 jrke: so POTW replaced by events?
 jrke: right?
 DomiKo: sounds good to me
 [CG]Thibaud: yes jrke
 jrke: nice
 [CG]Thibaud: any language DragonOfTheWest
 VizGhar: I know nothing more than Jon Snow euler :P
 eulerscheZahl: any for playing, JVM for creating (java, clojure, scala, kotlin)
 VizGhar: Hmm I'll make some visually appealing game then&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: who's Jon Snow?
 Oedipe: What are other games like the last challenge's one? Would love to practice
 Westicles: soul snatchers?
 Oedipe: Thank you I'll go look into it
 IvesL: broomstick flyers
 SirLoxley: I liked it a lot this time that the game state wasn't fully known, i.e. the fog really added a lot of appeal
 IvesL: its quite the same you push targets to goals
 jrke: Oedipe there are many in bot progamming page
 VizGhar: Code royale maybe too
 DragonOfTheWest: @Thibaud just not hacklang :c
 jrke: i would like to see if my clash bot still works
 jrke: :grinning:
 jacek: clash bot?
 jrke: i made it year ago
 nalka0: Is it normal that the whole legend league is being recomputed?
 nalka0: Will it happen for other leagues too?
 abt8601: Yes, only legend
 nalka0: What's the explanation for this?
 DragonOfTheWest: some people get dorment stuck in positions
 abt8601: To get more accurate rankings for the top players
 DragonOfTheWest: this will make the rankings as fair as possible 
 nalka0: But like why wouldn't that be a thing for other leagues than legend?
 jacek: you dont get t-shirt in other league
 nalka0: Alright you got a point but everyone deserves more accurate rankings right?
 Kasparas: wow, legend is packed, 400 bots :o
 Westicles: crazy that #1 fell to #10.  might need to run it 10k times
 DomiKo: I gained 1.8 already. Ranking wasn't stable at all
 jordonez: how can i see the final ranking?
 Nerchio: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2022/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/contests/spring-challenge-2022/leaderboard</a>
 jordonez: thanks
 Nerchio: still calculating
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo 12:12ᴾᴹI gained 1.8 already. Ranking wasn't stable at all
 eulerscheZahl: the rank gain/loss is the relevant part
 DomiKo: I went from ~30 to ~20
 jrke: i went 341 from 284
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/631447496">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/631447496</a>and the catapult in top10
 DomiKo: the old close top  5 is now far away 
 eulerscheZahl: should have gone of that nonsense strategy maybe
 eulerscheZahl: looks easy to code
 DomiKo:  catapult of wroclaw&#160;;) 
 eulerscheZahl: somehow toto and bondo only at 14% progress with the rest of us over 50%
 eulerscheZahl: oh, same for some at lower ranks, nevermind
 kovi: thourough search and/or tough defense to last200
 kovi: (3 defenders)
 Dapps: really interested to see post mortems. wonder what type of approaches people went with other than heuristics
 5DN1L: Have you checked out the forum post? Some people have posted theirs
 Kururugi: is there a list of quest map achievements requirements for each level(gold, silver) etc?
 5DN1L: You mean you want to see the hidden ones?
 5DN1L: The small icons along the paths give you an idea of how many achievements are required for that particular level
 VizGhar: Just ask what exactly you want to know and we will tell Kururugi
 eulerscheZahl: does the same apply if I ask a question?
 eulerscheZahl: lottery numbers of next week please. private messages are preferred
 VizGhar: Which lottery exactly?I'll tell you the numbers but they wont be correct (its not contradicting my post)
 eulerscheZahl: hm, i didn't consider that
 VizGhar: ok ok... still want those numbers?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 VizGhar: It's harder to guess than java random as you can tell&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: RealWorld.Random()
 VizGhar: Didn't know I can guess the random that easily in java
 eulerscheZahl: someone managed to reverse the generator for Number Shifting. and reCurse reversed some seeds for COde4Life
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i assumed that double + rounding would be harder than integers and not feasible
 Karang: integer is harder than double
 Karang: (if the bound for integer is non power of two, it gets tricky)
 eulerscheZahl: topcoder just uses SecureRandom. i'm not aware of anyone ever reversing it
 Karang: double always do 2 next, so it is very predictable
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 abt8601: Well, I guess if someone manages to reverse SecureRandom, then it probably deserves a CVE
 VizGhar: :thumbsup:
 jordonez: I'm very interested to see post mortems, where do people usually post them?
 DomiKo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736</a>
 jordonez: thanks!
 _Royale: Karang: haha I love your strategy, nice work&#160;:)
 Karang: thanks&#160;:)
 DomiKo: Sorry wala&#160;:(
 actualCoderTrevor: Seems like a lot of people took advantage of symmetry. Wish I'd thought of that.
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it but was too lazy to use that knowledge
 Husenap: symmerty in combination with predicting monsters outside of vision improved my bot a lot
 eulerscheZahl: but you are at the top, showing that you were willing to put effort into it
 Husenap: yup
 Husenap: just saying it's worth it&#160;:) 
 _NikJ: I saw someone mention it on discord and I tried to implement it, but ended up failing miserably
 Karang: it helps but you still need a good strategie on top of the prediction to take advantage of it
 Karang: I might have spent too much time on the prediction part
 Husenap: yeah, it's tricky, you have to decide what to do with the monsters that are outside your vision
 DustinNunyo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cfaf1a87-8870-4e67-8119-af6011f7776b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cfaf1a87-8870-4e67-8119-af6011f7776b</a>
 DustinNunyo: Oh wow... So I guess if your message is too long it just pastebins it. lol
 5DN1L: yes
 5DN1L: and i don't think there's a bug in python of CG
 Astrobytes: what?! Ofc there is! Everyone knows that :D
 5DN1L: :smirk:
 DustinNunyo: I mean, I'm doing the Fall 2020 challenge this is my code.
 DustinNunyo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e37e3581-6f7b-44b0-9d0e-35a015fa1bb8">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/e37e3581-6f7b-44b0-9d0e-35a015fa1bb8</a>
 Westicles: so when nma is the only guy left, all his opponents aren't impacted by the results?
 DustinNunyo: if you give me a minute; I will try to clean it up to just the part that is causing the issue.
 Whatar: might be related, on python when you to list2 = list1 you are not making a new list, you make a new list with list2 = list1.copy()
 DustinNunyo: Errr, isn't list2 = list1 supposed to create a dereferenced pointed that points to list1 and store it in list2 in python?
 DustinNunyo: pointer*
 5DN1L: nope
 DustinNunyo: yes it does... I just tested it
 DustinNunyo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/143def73-622c-483b-91c1-8d39d2488cce">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/143def73-622c-483b-91c1-8d39d2488cce</a>
 5DN1L: yeah, so both list1 and list2 are affected
 5DN1L: what's the issue
 DustinNunyo: It's not an issue, you just said that list2 = list1 does not create a dereferenced pointer that points to list1 and stores it in list2 but that is actually exactly what is happening on the backend. You are storing a reference not a value.
 5DN1L: ok maybe i misunderstand what you said
 5DN1L: my understanding is that both lists are modified that way
 eulerscheZahl: it's also Python's understanding. and that's what matters
 DustinNunyo: nah, list1 just points to the same memory address as list2 there aren't actually 2 lists just 2 names for the same list.
 5DN1L: and?
 5DN1L: what do you want to achieve?
 VizGhar: In Java everything that isn't primitive type is reference :P That's why I love C you know exactly what is happening
 eulerscheZahl: you mean assembler
 5DN1L: i also know exactly what is happening in python, i guess :P
 eulerscheZahl: you don't know it under the hood
 5DN1L: nah, i don't know
 eulerscheZahl: even an integer in python is a complicated thing
 5DN1L: all i need to know is how the variables change :P
 eulerscheZahl: how many bytes does an integer take? quick
 Tuo: i thought everything is a reference in python
 5DN1L: i never care about what's behind the scene
 Whatar: python does know what is happening, that's enough for me :heart_eyes:
 VizGhar: :D then you don't understand it
 DustinNunyo: not EVERYTHING. I think that ints and whatnot are stored as values
 Westicles: the french always say they should add a MPR library and be done with it
 DustinNunyo: it's only collections that are stored as reference in python.
 eulerscheZahl: MPR? mad pod racing?
 Westicles: yeah
 5DN1L: Anyway what's the "bug" then, DustinNunyo?
 eulerscheZahl: from MPR import reCurse
 VizGhar: eulerscheZahl how much is int? 4?
 eulerscheZahl: not sure, but much more
 VizGhar:&#160;??? is this python specific?
 DustinNunyo: Well I linked you the code earlier. I haven't had a chance to prune it down to just the bits causing the issue though.
 DustinNunyo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ac5d835-8353-447b-b1d1-6e3442de827a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6ac5d835-8353-447b-b1d1-6e3442de827a</a>
 DustinNunyo: This is for Fall Challenge 2020 Wood 1 League
 5DN1L: Explain what's bugging you with that code
 eulerscheZahl: &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(int())24
 DustinNunyo: the opponent's spells are being stored inside of the player object
 eulerscheZahl: then it grows when storing larger values
 DustinNunyo: (and I imagine vice versa is probably true as well)
 VizGhar: aha... sure... thats why they can compute 1000! without thinking
 DustinNunyo: in other words the line that says "player.spells[ action_id ] = Spell()" ends up creating a spell object in both the player and the opponent class.
 eulerscheZahl: and i'm pretty sure almost no one knows exactly what's going on behind the scenes when doing so
 eulerscheZahl: it's fine, we rarely have to know
 eulerscheZahl: that's the whole point of abstraction. we can concentrate on other things
 eulerscheZahl: i just disagree with"i also know exactly what is happening in python, i guess :P"
 5DN1L: fine, i'm just not exact enough&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: lol, fixit
 Tuo: &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(int(0)) 12  &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getsizeof(int(1)) 14  
 Tuo: how you explaing this&#160;?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: python3?
 Tuo: y
 eulerscheZahl: i get 24
 DustinNunyo: @Tuo you think that is weird? Try checking the size of a float vs an int of equivalent numerical value. lol
 eulerscheZahl: and 28 for int(1)
 yhyoxx: when top 10 postmortems&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: when top10 decide to write them
 Tuo: im 64x, the point was that there is a difference
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://twitter.com/bowwowforeach">https://twitter.com/bowwowforeach</a>the winner is tweeting already
 yhyoxx: Husenap wen postmortem&#160;? :weary:

 eulerscheZahl: expect more details on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/">https://bowwowforeach.hatenablog.com/</a>
 Astrobytes: gotta love google translate and Japanese
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like something went wrong with tran...
 eulerscheZahl: yes, that
 Astrobytes: I don't care what the real meaning is, I like that statement just as it is
 eulerscheZahl: for a previous contest everyone was writing about their grandma suddenly
 eulerscheZahl: took me a while to realize it's about the witch of the contest game
 Astrobytes: haha
 DustinNunyo:&#160;:'( Well, it's definitely a bug in my code
 DustinNunyo: I just simplified it down and it's working fine.
 jrke: recalc completed!

 abt8601: Recomputations are over
 VizGhar: python is highly usable garbage
 VizGhar: oh... it scrolled like 20pages :D sorry
 gaha: I though speed didn't matter much in this contest
 gaha: but then top7 ended up non python
 gaha: and 6 are C++
 abt8601: Maybe they use some form of search
 Mattant: gaha so you're the best of python users?
 DustinNunyo: ooooh, wait a minute... I see what is going on... I am defining the spells list outside of the __init__() method and so it's treating it like a static member for some reason.

 Husenap: no I mean ms
 Husenap: the time does not include reading input
 Husenap: it's the time it takes for the logic of one turn
 jacek: applied ifology?
 DustinNunyo: @Tuo Thanks man!
 Husenap: 👌
 Husenap: you know it, jacek
 Mattant: This contest was one big applied ifology test lol
 Husenap: it's gonna be interesting to see what people come up with later
 Husenap: but I enjoyed this contest quite a bit, the battle at the top of the leaderboard was wild
 Dapps: i had a lot of fun. just wish we don't need to wait a year for the next one&#160;:( 
 jacek: well, one was cracking prng seed ~
 SalvoUndMartina: python wixer
 DustinNunyo: wow... that bug took a minute to solve... At least now I know how to do static and non-static members in python. lol That being said, I think that I already knew how to do them once upon a time... lol
 InDeSchrank: niemer hät eu gern
 DragonOfTheWest: blasterpoard was doing actual computations
 SalvoUndMartina: Who asked
 DragonOfTheWest: im just curious what kind of algo that guy had
 Westicles: bowwows algorithm was "an instantiation of happy clouds"
 Astrobytes: and he said "I've only been a kid for the past few days, so I'm a beard."
 Husenap: wth
 Astrobytes: That's some raw knowledge.
 jacek: Automaton2000 what does it mean?
 Automaton2000: i know where you are going to have to do anything
 Husenap: 🤔
 SalvoUndMartina: father is abusive
 SalvoUndMartina: They took the precious
 5DN1L: no spamming please
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 Fwcode: 0/10k codin points for the contest?

 Automaton2000: and i like the idea
 cclaude42: So it's over&#160;? :o
 cclaude42: No more computing looks like
 abt8601: Yes it's pretty much over
 eulerscheZahl: it's completely over
 eulerscheZahl: next: global leaderboard updates, achievements, release in multiplayer section, shipment of prizes
 eulerscheZahl: and hopefully: announcement of next contest
 [ron]: @Fwcode: points computed once per day - so expect to see your points within less than 24 hrs
 yhyoxx: why wouldnt they do another contest&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i mean: hopefully another one soon
 yhyoxx: fall&#160;?
 [ron]: just one per year now?
 Fwcode: @[ron] ty
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud mentioned some company contest that might be open to everyone. didn't say anything about the time schedule
 Astrobytes: inb4 "we haven't decided yet" :P
 jacek: didnt he meant this one? ;o
 Ose: Hi guys
 wlesavo: jacek :smiley:
 Ose: Wow I remember some of you

 Ose: I have'nt
 Astrobytes: time to abandon the chat again
 KalamariKing: fr
 demetedPufferfish: Hi, I did the spring challenge 2022 yesterday before it ended. I wanted to keep coding it today, but I couldn't find it. Could someone tell me where to keep coding the spring challenge?
 Ose: Oh
 eulerscheZahl: you will soon find the game here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>

 demetedPufferfish: Could you tell me when it will be available?
 jacek: probably next week
 Ose: I signed up for it last year
 demetedPufferfish: Ok, Thank You!
 Ose: I only remember jackek
 jacek: oh my
 eulerscheZahl: do you remember Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: did you just make a function bool shouldusewind(hero, monster) { //add 10-15 conditions }
 Ose: Yes!
 Ose: French person
 Ose: I only remember some of the mods
 eulerscheZahl: speaks poor english. but always happy to chat with you
 therealbeef: did Automaton2000 already pick up lang from this contest? :O
 Automaton2000: thought i had to do some it stuff/decision at the customer
 Ose: 2 of the mods
 eulerscheZahl: which ones?
 Ose: But I forget
 Ose: 5DN1L
 Astrobytes: not even a day and the chat is back to tripe again
 Ose: Oops
 Ose: :relieved:
 jacek: :taco: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yeah i think i can do something like
 Ose: Well better get going!
 Ose: See ya!
 DustinNunyo: I have a question, is CG smart about assertions? What I mean is, if I put assertions in my code for testing; those assertions won't run in the arena correct?
 Ose: CG must be complex so, yes
 aangairbender: I think they will
 aangairbender: code in arena should behave exactly as in ide
 DustinNunyo: I guess a good way to test it is to just assert(False) at the top of my code and push my bot... lol
 jacek: the code will run the same as in ide as well in arena
 Astrobytes: if you mean C++ you must #define NDEBUG to deactivate assert()
 DustinNunyo: I was referring to python but that is actually good to know about C++ as I do plan to start using it more.
 Astrobytes: (before you include &lt;cassert&gt;)
 Ose: I said I will be leaving Codingame soon

 Astrobytes: yep
 DomiKo: any cheaters?
 Astrobytes: donno tbh
 DustinNunyo: Dang... This 2020 Fall Challenge is rough... lol
 Ose: Eh..
 Miki09: Is fall challenge 2022 going to be bot programming?
 DomiKo: yes
 Miki09: Or coding escape?
 DustinNunyo: aren't all the seasonal challenges bot programming?
 Miki09: no
 Astrobytes: we don't even know if there will be one yet
 IvesL: i think escape was just a one time public test last time
 Miki09: contests 2018: 7 contests. 2021: 2 contests&#160;:-(
 jacek: 2?
 Astrobytes: yeah, we were spoiled in 2018
 Astrobytes: there was only one last year
 Miki09: if you count fall then 2
 DomiKo: imagine being at CT in 2014
 DomiKo: CG*
 Astrobytes: I don't count escapes
 Ose: Please do not leave
 Miki09: Why dont we have more events?&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: it's not a priority, they don't have the resources
 jacek: they spent all moneys for lawyers and copyrighters
 Astrobytes: concentrating on the CG for Work (it is their income after all)
 Miki09: And what if community would make contests for free?
 Miki09: like mean max§
 Tuo: we should figure out a way to profit from our self!
 Astrobytes: we used to do that
 Miki09: then why not now?
 Tuo: then lots of content&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: but they don't have the time or resources to do all the testing and advertising
 Astrobytes: plus server costs etc etc
 Miki09:&#160;:-(
 Astrobytes: hey, it was great while it lasted; we were lucky

 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo 04:03ᴾᴹany cheaters?
 DomiKo: ok
 Dapps: cheaters as in code sharing?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: in the past there were always a few inconsiderate players who used a public github repo
 eulerscheZahl: and others who thought they were clever
 eulerscheZahl: then player count dropped a bit after their automated cheat check
 eulerscheZahl: always the same few suspects that get removed :P
 Astrobytes: indeed
 eulerscheZahl: i was bored one day. so i generated some replays under the same conditions and compared them (i can't see the code, so false positives / negatives are possible)<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?game=hypersonic">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/leaderboards/?game=hypersonic</a>
 eulerscheZahl: the 3rd of the contest shared the code after the end
 cegprakash: recalc pushed me down 20 ranks -_-
 cegprakash: at least not so bad as it usually is
 -Revelation-: How many people participated?
 eulerscheZahl: 7705
 -Revelation-: thx
 Dapps: hmm. now what to do with all this free time
 kurnevsky: Solve all previous challenges that you missed&#160;:)
 DomiKo: you can do many bot games here :D

 Astrobytes: aCat: you should know by now that it takes a couple of days! :P
 eulerscheZahl: haha
 Astrobytes: :D
 aCat: hmm
 aCat: last achievement for the contest I got some years ago
 aCat: so nope ;p do't remember ;p
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: same aCat
 eulerscheZahl: i don't get better
 SadKris: Where do I access the contest?
 jacek: its over. it will be available as bot programming next week
 eulerscheZahl: maybe even earlier
 SadKris: Where would I have? Under Events?
 Wontonimo: well, that was a fun contest.  I didn't have the time I wanted to invest in it and didn't get to Legend, but it was nice seeing everyone and being part of the struggle
 jacek: yes, it was in events as well the main page
 5DN1L: ACTIVITIES &gt; COMPETE &gt; CONTESTS
 ClockSort: is there a Fall 2022 Challenge planned?
 5DN1L: No plans announced yet. We don't know
 ClockSort: hoping for a contest like this one :D
 jacek: we can always make our own contest with blackjack and hookers
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: 6 players removed
 Wontonimo: wdym 6 players removed?
 Westicles: They killed CaptainHamburger!
 Wontonimo: oh?  why
 HoriMiyamura: what is wdym?
 abt8601: what do you mean
 Astrobytes: the anti-cheat
 Astrobytes: duplicate code
 Wontonimo: oh
 Wontonimo: tisk tisk 
 Wontonimo: naughty naughty
 DomiKo: 6!!!
 abt8601: Is it a big number compared to past contests?
 Wontonimo: there really isn't that much code.  it could just all be pre-processed, hashed and soft duplicates quickly found
 DomiKo: 6 From Legend :anguished:
 Wontonimo: where do you see who was removed?
 Astrobytes: well, I noticed the player count drop from 7705 to 7699
 Wontonimo: or did someone take a snapshot of before 
 DomiKo: Legend had exactly 400 players. Now its 394
 Wontonimo: ah, yeah the count would do it
 Astrobytes: I always count using the main player count, I tend to forget how many were in legend
 Wontonimo: I'd love to run a NN over the solutions and see if it can generate  novel working solutions
 Astrobytes: run it over your versions of your own bot
 Wontonimo: i didn't get to legend though
 Astrobytes: no, but you might still generate a novel working solution
 Wontonimo: also, it would be a very small set
 Astrobytes: :D
 Wontonimo: true.
 Astrobytes: afk
 jacek: :taco: Wontonimo
 Waffle3z: gold silver and bronze all have around 2k each, pretty even
 Waffle3z: when do contests usually open back up as a multi?
 jacek: 30th february
 Waffle3z: cool that's in a couple days
 JRFerguson: Waffle3z it has changed, sometimes it opened right after and sometimes it was longer, but most often they take 3 days
 Butanium: any chance that cannon will be patched in the multiplayer game&#160;?
 antiwonto: [auto] jacek has awarded Wontonimo 10 tacos. Wontonimo now has 45 taco. jacek now has 15 taco
 Wontonimo: tacos are back
 abt8601: taco powers

 Westicles: yikes, the guys removed were corporate, how embarrasing
 jacek: justic and law corporate?
 _Royale: Karang: are you still there?
 Karang: yeah
 _Royale: I was wondering if you had issues with this HashMap <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L288">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/main/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Referee.java#L288</a>
 _Royale: when multiple mobs get pushed outside of the base on the same turn, they consume the Random generator in the order they get out of the HashMap
 jacek: cracking random seed?
 Karang: I chose to ignore it, basically it prevented me from predicting the mob direction, but i could just maintain the seed by skipping n nextDouble
 _Royale: no when I tried to 100% reproduce the referee I had differences I was not able to fix because of this HashMap
 Karang: there is a PR someone opened to change it
 _Royale: Karang: oh of course I see, you don't get out of sync
 Butanium: #test we can create channels&#160;?
 Astrobytes: yes
 Karang: if the order was predictable, i could have resync more easely and do more predictions
 Butanium: wait you could get the seed from a match Karang&#160;?
 Westicles: Now down to 392,

 Westicles: they got Hori
 _Royale: Karang: thanks I did not see that PR. If I remember correctly we already had an issue on a previous contest because of Java HashMaps
 Karang: yeah it's anoying especially if they don't define a hash for their objects
 jordanemedlock: h
 jacek:&#160;!

 Link_jon: .... Okay, my for loop is throwing me through a loop.-- 1, 3, 2, is appearntly the correct way to count
 jacek: oO
 Badoobicus: lol arena going WAY faster now that the contest is over
 Wontonimo: which arena&#160;?
 Wontonimo: if you are using javascript foreach Link_jon, that happens
 Badoobicus: Pod Racing
 jacek: all arenas
 Link_jon: Lua; Numeric for.
 Badoobicus: Last night it took me like 2 hours to run my submission through all the arena battles. Now it's like 10 minutes.
 Wontonimo: oh, i thought the contest was moved to bot programming and I wanted to get in
 Wontonimo: Badoobicus , has anyone shared this with you for mad pod racing <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf">https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS354_F17/handouts/pid.pdf</a>
 Westicles: back to our original programming
 Link_jon: ...hm. due to how Lua is, i wouldnt be surprised if it has the same problem here (Its a scripting language too :P)
 Link_jon: I'll just change it to a while loop witha counter
 Badoobicus: No I have not seen that, thanks for the info @Wontonimo! 
 Astrobytes: PID, GA, NNs, the list goes on
 jacek: people just use -3vel to get to gold
 jacek: NNs are used by top of the top
 Scarfield: i got legend with -3vel and some simple blocking heuristic iirc
 Astrobytes: also there is minimax, smitsimax/UCT forest
 Astrobytes: sounds plausible Scarfield
 _NikJ: I still remember MadKnight's tip from years ago, dude said "Just print vector multiplied by 3, that should work" - it put me straight into gold
 _NikJ: 1 line of code, vx*3
 Astrobytes: -3
 Badoobicus: Welp I'm still only in Bronze so I'll see if I can at least get to Silver without needing to get a PhD first
 Link_jon: (Eh idk. maybe my tests are printing too fast to print in the right order)
 Astrobytes: -3
 Scarfield: targetpos - 3*vel
 Badoobicus: Semi-related: is there a way to have debug messages appear above the pod like in the Spring contest? Or do I just have to print to stderr?
 jacek: dont target next checkpoint. target next checkpoint - 3* speed of your pod
 jacek: yes
 jacek: just like contest, print msg after space
 Scarfield: or target 3*vx, and see what it does :p pod goes brrr
 Astrobytes: :D
 abt8601: :joy:
 Link_jon: lul. mucho speedo
 Badoobicus: ok @jacek thanks!
 Scarfield: gotta admit i liked this contest, just didnt have much time&#160;:'(

 Astrobytes: gg struct, well done
 struct: thanks
 derjack: on it alone probably much better
 Scarfield: i cant open the SR optim&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: or you'll turn into a pumpkin?
 jacek: site was down for a second now&#160;;?
 _NikJ: still is for me
 Badoobicus: Yep went down for me too
 Scarfield: a pumpkin?
 _NikJ: I'm not even doing anything and it keeps telling me network error
 Astrobytes: if you open SR
 Astrobytes: like from cinderalla
 Astrobytes: *cinderella
 Scarfield: xD
 Astrobytes: the carriage turns into a pumpkin at midnight
 jacek: site was down for a moment, refresh the browser
 Scarfield: bibbidy bobbidy
 struct: yeah site is not working properly
 _NikJ: An error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session".
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: my ranks are not showing with mouse hover on bot programming
 struct: ah
 struct: it was because I blocked it :D
 Astrobytes: lmao
 Link_jon: ah okay it wasnt just me. (i thought i was so bad at coding i crashed the website on my end lul)
 Scarfield: lol
 Segfault_4573256634: An error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session".

 Astrobytes: nope
 DollarAkshay: XD
 Scarfield: im pretty sure i know that link
 Scarfield: im never gonna ... click it
 _Royale: jacek: oh are you trying reinforcement learning on search race?
 jacek: everyone who clicked showing off they didnt click it
 Astrobytes: no jacek, we are used to your behaviour
 Scarfield: and for some reason i remember the dqw part of the url
 jacek: _Royale trying neuroevolution and evolution strategies. no q-learning, A3C TRPO etc. yet
 KalamariKing: did the servers just 500 or was that just for me
 Kururugi: must be just you
 _Royale: jacek: nice. I discovered these recently, I tried "PPO" but without much success yet
 BrunoFelthes: any PM from top 10?
 Westicles: all the in/outs are busted

 eulerscheZahl: congrats for climbing some ranks at the end Royale. saw you struggling in gold for a while (at least it looked like that as you were submitting but far from the boss)
 Scarfield: +1
 jacek: KalamariKing since when you are that furrious
 KalamariKing: only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session L
 KalamariKing: jacek :flushed: since like, early 2021
 _Royale: eulerscheZahl: yes I had a hard time in gold!

 vitalii.kulik: hi. how do i solve it? "OupsAn error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session"."
 5DN1L: Wait for CG to fix it
 _Royale: jacek: nice&#160;:-) you should had the Initial D theme
 KalamariKing: vitalii.kulik i think a lot of people are getting the same thing, the servers threw an error 500 for a minute or so before this
 eulerscheZahl: oh, we lost 10 players. only 390 in legend now
 vitalii.kulik: oh, ok. thanks. thought it just for me
 peerdb: cheaters?
 DollarAkshay: OupsAn error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session".
 Astrobytes: yes, 5 cheaters and 5 alts
 peerdb: ah people also push alts to legend? odd
 KalamariKing: :skull:
 AntonBlockchain: Hello!/Whats this error on test code in IDE?OupsAn error occurred (#73): "Only 1 executor running at the same time for a test session"
 5DN1L: CG bug
 5DN1L: Wait for them to fix it
 jacek: tomorrow~
 Westicles: tomorrow
 5DN1L: Lucky that the bug didn't break out during the contest...
 Scarfield: that would have been sad
 Darleanow: hello 5DN1L
 5DN1L: hello Darleanow
 Darleanow: Thats nice the devs added the 24h format time
 Darleanow: how are you&#160;?
 5DN1L: not bad, thank you.
 5DN1L: You good?
 KalamariKing: "you good" :skull:
 Darleanow: I'm really good except the fact that my boss put me on a freakin hard projecty
 AntonBlockchain: thanks)
 KalamariKing: oh hey the ide works again
 VizGhar: difficulty of project should not be a problem... deadlines are&#160;:)
 KalamariKing: ^
 Darleanow: i'm only a student xD
 jacek: so youll do it night before deadline
 Darleanow: and it's hard to find documentation that i actually understand
 5DN1L: Darleanow time to learn harder then :D
 Darleanow: i'm already over the deadline ahahhaha
 Link_jon: i feel this
 VizGhar: :D do you have senior dev at least there?
 Darleanow: i'm not working in dev 
 Darleanow: i want to 
 Darleanow: but i'm more on networking atm
 VizGhar: missed deadlines is management problem

 Darleanow: brb gotta do smth
 blasterpoard: _Royale yes, it's there now
 blasterpoard: I was just editing link to make sure they are displayed correctly

 eulerscheZahl: i think i can safely upvote before reading
 Astrobytes: lol
 Achess: Hello, is there any CG moderator available? There seems to be a huge performance issue on Dart.I can't even read the data of the test without timeouting…
 jacek: there are problems in servers right now
 Scarfield: there is a clause (by upvoting this PM, you agree that Blaster is greater than you in every way)
 eulerscheZahl: moderators are here. but their powers don't affect Dart performance
 Achess: I know but the issue is way older, it's been going on since this morning
 eulerscheZahl: but he is, Scarfield
 jacek: report this on forums or discord
 eulerscheZahl: except: i'm 1.84mno idea if that's big enough
 Scarfield: xD
 Achess: I know but they can forward it to the dev team
 Achess: thanks jacek
 eulerscheZahl: #bug-reports channel on discord
 Scarfield: i hope thats your height
 5DN1L: I don't know who is the dev team :thinking:
 Astrobytes: well either that or he's john dillermand Scarfield
 Scarfield: xD
 eulerscheZahl: no, it's my weight. 1.84 megagrams.of course it's my height...
 Scarfield: you might have missed my improper innuendo
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: i ignored it
 Link_jon: mm
 Waffle3z: just noticed I'm 6th in counting tic tac toe, which is still broken because I solved it and then nothing changed
 Scarfield: i figured, but you never know
 jacek: you solved and youre only 6th
 BrunoFelthes: finally blasterpoard PM
 Waffle3z: yeah I can never lose but others are better at winning
 BJD: i solved, but im at 29th
 Waffle3z: could maybe get 1st if I kept resubmitting to flatten everyone else's scores so that a single victory brings me above anyone else
 struct: I dont think its getting changed
 Waffle3z: just making the board an odd size would fix it
 Waffle3z: all even-sized boards are trivially drawn
 jdell64: anyone do the mars lander?
 jacek: but odd size favors p1 too much
 Waffle3z: run it twice
 jacek: jdell64 whats your question
 Scarfield: steal
 jdell64: oh i'm just not sure what to do... I have found an LZ, I have a degree from the mid point of the LZ to the lander... speed is alluding me
 jacek: episode 2?
 struct: hmm, I don't know what to do now, pick a bot programming and make a bot for it, or finish porting backgammon
 struct: o.o
 jacek: backport gammon
 Link_jon: gammonport backs
 Scarfield: make it with zelda theme, and call it backgannon, to copyright dangers
 BulletHeaven: aahhahahahahaah
 Scarfield: to = no *
 struct: can you copyright board game rules?
 jdell64: you can copyright the rulebook
 jdell64: not the mechanics
 Scarfield: backgammon is too old
 struct: "Years active:1646 to present"
 struct: I think I'll be safe
 jacek: hmm? i thought it was ancient
 Link_jon: I agree with this btw.Also idk. Tons of monopoly clones. Kirby is in pinball?
 jdell64: monopoly clones are licensed by the company (milton bradley?)
 Scarfield: its probably based on the royale game of ur, which is 4000 years old iirc
 Link_jon: fair.
 jdell64: the only thing you have to worry about when copying game mechanics is "will people hate me for doing this"... (imo, i'm not a lawyer)... If people would be like, "hmm this lame company can't make original stuff" then yeah, you have a problem
 Brawler_zx: Hello everyone , can we not practice on the contests once they are over?
 Brawler_zx: like spring challenge 
 struct: Brawler_zx it should become a multi soon
 struct: maybe tomorrow?
 Astrobytes: yes but there is a short delay before it becomes available
 Brawler_zx: cool
 jdell64: and i don't think i'm on episode 2
 Brawler_zx: Is there an archive where ended contest questions are?
 Astrobytes: in the forum, yes
 Astrobytes: just search for the name of the game
 eulerscheZahl: what's a contest question?
 Brawler_zx: Got it thanks 
 Astrobytes: feedback/strageies
 Astrobytes: *strategies
 eulerscheZahl: ah. somehow i read it like "where can i find the previous multiple-choice contests we had"
 Astrobytes: :D
 dimp: When will the Spring Challenge be available as a bot programming challenge?
 Waffle3z: code of the rings is called "brain fork" now but it still has the same "code of the rings" background
 Scarfield: within the next few days probably
 eulerscheZahl: brain fork was my suggestion
 Waffle3z: 🧠🍴
 Astrobytes: one of the better names used after The Great Renaming
 Astrobytes: *during
 eulerscheZahl: i tried quality over quantity with my suggestions
 eulerscheZahl: i also claim authorship over "Death first search"
 Waffle3z: guess we weren't worried about A*Craft
 Astrobytes: hehehe I still remember when you suggested Death First
 eulerscheZahl: it was also on the list
 eulerscheZahl: and game of drones too
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if they still intend to change the name
 Astrobytes: perhaps a low priority
 jacek: copyright a low priority in usa? oO
 Astrobytes: maybe not so dangerous, assuming they had an IP lawyer look at it
 jacek: tcp/ip lawyer
 Astrobytes: lol. not bad
 Link_jon: why not ipv6
 Waffle3z: all of the finished contests still use the original names
 Waffle3z: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a>
 Astrobytes: Yeah, probably a technicality there
 Waffle3z: now they're just named "spring challenge [year]" and "fall challenge [year]"
 Astrobytes: And Boss 1, Boss 2, Boss 3 etc too&#160;:(
 Waffle3z: lame
 Astrobytes: sad times
 Scarfield: moboss
 struct: Just wait until I port a nintendo game
 struct: Then we will find the limits
 Scarfield: mario pod
 Astrobytes: Super Moira Sisters
 Scarfield: breadth of the wild
 eulerscheZahl: just make sure that i can take over control and play it manually instead of watching my bot in action
 eulerscheZahl: technically it would be doable
 struct: it is
 Scarfield: you can that for smash the code, only found out a few months aago
 eulerscheZahl: but not mid-game
 struct: oh MSmits lost his rank 1 on yavalath
 struct: Someone call him
 Scarfield: o0
 Astrobytes: who has it now?
 struct: robo
 struct: I think royale pushed him
 Astrobytes: ah
 actualCoderTrevor: I started going down the human-interaction path for this contest. I wanted to use human-interaction and backprop to train my NN. I got as far as displaying the board and heroes and keeping the referee from raising a timeout exception. I realized the runner still moves on without any input in time though. That's when I realized yesterday there wasn't enough time to finish that strat. I still want to explore it.
 actualCoderTrevor: Using another bot as a starting point for backprop would also be interesting.
 jacek: :thinking:
 jacek: using NNs on CG, is it feasible?
 actualCoderTrevor: It's been done, hasn't it?
 Astrobytes: he's trolling you
 jacek: :zipper_mouth:
 Scarfield: Natural Numbers have been used before i think
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 Link_jon: GAH. Lua is trying to tell me that numbers == nil and thats just nuuuu
 struct: dont trust lua
 actualCoderTrevor: Astrobytes ah no IHBT
 Astrobytes: jacek is actually a good resource to talk about NNs on CG with
 jacek: IHBT?
 actualCoderTrevor: I have been trolled
 jacek: oh my
 Link_jon: I mean... Lua is one of my best friends... right there beside google&#160;:/
 struct: whats the value of x before that?
 Link_jon: 1
 Astrobytes: like everything in Lua
 Astrobytes: counting from 1... smdh
 Link_jon: albiet i am 2 tables deep
 Link_jon: but if thats why this is going wrong, i blame codingame lul
 Scarfield: how do you index the first element of an array in lua, also with 1?
 Astrobytes: yes
 struct: Hmm  i just tried and got no errors
 struct: x = 1x = x + 1io.stderr:write(x)
 Scarfield: at least thats coherent
 Link_jon: err. How does i use the pastebin here?
 struct: just paste it
 Astrobytes: it does it automatically 
 struct: I will generate a link for you
 Scarfield: it makes a pastebin automatically
 Scarfield: argh
 Astrobytes: :D

 Link_jon: noice
 Link_jon: particularly that for loop at the end
 jzen: What does the '#' do in ' if tiling== #linesX[loopX] then'?
 Scarfield: #'test
 antiwonto: [auto] 'test' was defined as ' this is a test '
 Link_jon: "#" is what i need to ignore; walls
 jacek: are you doing bender
 Astrobytes: that pikachu puzzle
 Link_jon: Left the link at the top of code
 jzen: But it is in the if statement
 jzen: I was just wondering if it is special lua thing or if you accidentally put it there
 jzen: *some special
 Astrobytes: In these locations:for loopX= 1,#linesX dofor tiling=1,#linesX[loopX] do
 Link_jon: Well... the four ifs that set side[x] to "#", are moreso so i dont have nil problems with tables when looking past the grid
 Link_jon: LoopX==1 is when we are at the top. So we set the top side (side[1]) to be a wall "#"
 Link_jon: Same goes for the next three
 Astrobytes: but why is there a # in for loopX= 1,#linesX do
 jzen: Oh nevermind, it is the length operator in lua
 Astrobytes: ah cool
 Link_jon: OHHHH
 Link_jon: #table &lt;-- is like table.len()
 Link_jon: Gets length of table
 Astrobytes: yep, gotcha now
 Astrobytes: still not sure what the issue is, try printing x to stderr and stepping through it
 Astrobytes: is all I can suggest
 Link_jon: note; linesX[loopX][tiling] is what the problem child is
 Link_jon: and yeh
 Astrobytes: linesX[loopX][tiling] = tonumber(linesX[loopX][tiling])+1
 Astrobytes: what's the +1
 Link_jon: Yeh
 Link_jon: Ah, due to needing print out what tiles have how many neighbors, im counting said neighbors

 Link_jon: tonumber isnt doing the prevention i want
 Link_jon: type(tonumber())=="number" will though
 Link_jon: Thanks yous
 Link_jon: onto the next problem lul
 struct: np
 Astrobytes: saved for later Scarfield
 Link_jon: wait hold on am dumb.
 Scarfield: suspected you might enjoy&#160;:)
 Link_jon: I need to apply more if statements
 jacek: true ai
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: just started reading The Long Earth, have you read it? 
 Astrobytes: Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Baxter
 Scarfield: nope, but almost finished with my current series, so need a new book
 Astrobytes: it's a whole series but I never got round to it
 Scarfield: probably gonna start some scifi, asimov or any of the other ones you guys recommended not too long ago
 Astrobytes: this is scifi too
 Astrobytes: multi-dimensions 
 Scarfield: added to my list&#160;:)
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Scarfield: its rare you see a book with more than one auther, interesting
 Astrobytes: not in the scifi and fantasy world
 Astrobytes: it's common
 ycsvenom:     
 Scarfield: had no idea, but as mentioned before, i havent read anything scifi yet. btw any fantasy book suggestions to put on my list. A Song of Ice and Fire is some of the books i enjoyed the most
 Scarfield: as in enjoyed the most of everything i have read
 Astrobytes: I'm not a particularly avid reader of  fantasy stuff tbh
 Astrobytes: you've presumably read Tolkien etc
 Scarfield: yup
 Astrobytes: For me it never really gets better than that lol
 Scarfield: well actually didnt read the 3rd LoTR
 Astrobytes: Oh you should
 Scarfield: was maybe 11-12 and the passing was too slow for me then, never got back to it
 Astrobytes: Give them a re-read
 cukcan: hi
 Astrobytes: That said, I still have never finished Queen of the Damned 
 Scarfield: sure, reading them in english is also most likely a lot better, read 1 and 2 in danish back then
 Westicles: Patrick Rothfuss?  I think the 3rd book is finally coming out
 jacek: :scream:
 Astrobytes: Ah I see. 
 Astrobytes: oh and all of Pratchett's Discworld if you haven't already
 Westicles: Not all of those are great...
 Link_jon: Got it working :D
 Astrobytes: hmm my friend recommended Rothfuss too actually Westicles
 Astrobytes: and true
 Scarfield: Rothfuss and discworld added to list&#160;:)
 Westicles: The kids like him, but he's left a trilogy ending hanging for 11 years
 Astrobytes: John Ringo Posleen War - style
 Astrobytes: "I don't want to write about it any more"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Asimov Foundation Trilogy, good read.  Children of Dune as well.  LoTR is hard to read.  Sry, stuck my nose in
 Scarfield: i know the pain, the last book from GRR Martin (Dance of Dragons) was published 11 years ago
 Astrobytes: the more the merrier Patrick
 Lysk: GRR Martin scify novels are nice too
 Scarfield: actually only read ASoIaF, but heard good about his other works before&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: my friend swears by those too, but I didn't get on with his fantasy stuff so maybe not for me
 Scarfield: what did you try to read?
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://preview.redd.it/7recdbw1zk451.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4d7b7bc695bec895d86e51edcfc8b5a8cc9f0016">https://preview.redd.it/7recdbw1zk451.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4d7b7bc695bec895d86e51edcfc8b5a8cc9f0016</a>
 Astrobytes: A bunch of them, I don't remember the titles. Was when I was housesitting in Sweden, my mate left a list of books to read from his bookshelves
 Astrobytes: I kept getting really bored.
 Astrobytes: (with his writing)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Java books don't make you cry ... ever read any of the first Perl books?
 Astrobytes: I never got into GoT either (just for context)
 Scarfield: weird, i guess you have to take the time to get into the world of the story, but A Song of Ice and Fire is likely the series i have enjoyed the most. taste is a funny thing&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Camel books all the way
 Scarfield: GoT is not the same though, the first few seasons are close, but i havent seen past the books. and from reviews im probably not gonna watch the last seasons anyway
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did SC2022 finish it's rerun?
 Astrobytes: ages ago
 Lysk: yes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: how did yall rank?
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: yeah, it's more a style thing I think with his writing, it annoyed me. Just didn't get on with it :shrug:
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: I didn't bother looking, somewhere in gold
 Westicles: I had a tight race with tbali for the groovy title
 Astrobytes: chainsaws at dawn :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i see report, but can't find leaderboard

 EddyA: Hi, any date to be able to play agin?
 Scarfield: didnt get the reference (dusk till dawn, chainsaw massacre)
 struct: EddyA usually its available the next day
 Westicles: Astro, nope.  evil dead maybe?
 Scarfield: np ginsli
 Astrobytes: COIF is a great game struct
 struct: But I would say it will be available this week for sure
 Astrobytes: Westicles: 1 point to you
 EddyA: Thx!
 Astrobytes: Any time I see or hear "groovy" I see Ash in my mind

 jacek: not clicking
 Astrobytes: shut up jacek
 Astrobytes: :D
 Scarfield: lol jacek
 jacek: oO
 Scarfield: nice clip astro, apparently i havent seen evil daed
 Scarfield: dead*
 Astrobytes: brilliant they are
 Astrobytes: random yoda speak I talk
 Scarfield: lol did read it in yoda voice xD
 Scarfield: huumhhf
 Astrobytes: &lt;shuffling noises&gt;
 jacek: Automaton2000 is this some markov chain talking?
 Automaton2000: i don't want to learn it
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: is the force strong in me Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: yes, but i don't know how to find a way to send a message
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 Scarfield: noice
 _Royale: sorry Karang, just realized you explained the HashMap part in your PM, don't know why I missed it, I must be too tired :dizzy_face:
 Karang: no worries :p
 PatrickMcGinnisII: karang needs to mke a seed finde puzzle
 Karang: I thought about that, there are a few puzzles that can be made about LCG
 Link_jon: Sigh. python doesnt want lists inside lists
 PatrickMcGinnisII: did they just remove some people from te leaderboard, i thing rank changed
 PatrickMcGinnisII: looks like the sabotaged bots r gone
 Astrobytes: they did earlier, from legend
 Astrobytes: 5 alts from legend players and 5 dupes from the same company
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, someone look at my garbage code and go...yup that mf submitted a bot on crack

 5DN1L: Link_jon You can have lists inside lists in python
 eulerscheZahl: i can neither confirm nor deny that i took a snapshot of the leaderboard to find the missing names
 Link_jon: ... Huh. Strange, i cant seem to convince python to be happy with this arrangement. Guess i should keep poking at it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: one name on that list was asking alot of questions
 Wontonimo: list_of_word_lists = []list_of_word_lists.append( ['hi','there] )
 Wontonimo: Link_jon ^^
 Wontonimo: ist_of_word_lists.append( ['another','entry'] )
 Link_jon: Allrighty, thanks.
 Wontonimo: okay, you'll have to fix my syntax errors
 Link_jon:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but all of those players were below 200 before getting removed
 eulerscheZahl: wait, they were all the exact same code?
 eulerscheZahl: with user ID and rank:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/341623f0-f969-4a55-9318-e20eeb2579b0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/341623f0-f969-4a55-9318-e20eeb2579b0</a>
 Scarfield: 5 were i believe from same company
 eulerscheZahl: that's 100 ranks difference for the same code?
 eulerscheZahl: same company + same code or similar code?
 Scarfield: same code
 Wontonimo: Link_jon <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/6gBRwWM">https://tech.io/snippet/6gBRwWM</a>
 eulerscheZahl: ranking randomness confirmed then
 Link_jon: Yeyah
 eulerscheZahl: 3 dead even. 1 above, 1 below
 Wontonimo: wow, i didn't realized how much CG has scaled back on contests until I looked at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished">https://www.codingame.com/contests/finished</a> 
 Wontonimo: 7 contests in 2018
 Astrobytes: yes, we were spoiled - nay, ruined - in 2018
 eulerscheZahl: some of them are puzzle contests when you go back even further
 peerdb: 7 times 10 days is quite a lot of time to invest
 Wontonimo: yeah, i was just looking at 2014
 Astrobytes: there were unofficial ones that we barged into as well
 eulerscheZahl: legends of code and magic had a 4h sprint contest
 eulerscheZahl: and a 4 week marathon
 Astrobytes: lol, does that count
 Astrobytes: the sprint
 eulerscheZahl: no =&gt; 6 contests
 Wontonimo: on the other had peerdb, you'd probably build up more of a local toolset and have a lot more reuse
 peerdb: that's also fair
 Astrobytes: it was also a lot of fun
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 digitalix-ai: Would be great, if the game was available for practice, now after the contest is over...
 eulerscheZahl: will be soon
 Astrobytes: it most likely will be
 PatrickMcGinnisII: +/- 100 raanks for same code...gasp
 eulerscheZahl: Thibaud told us not to share code. so I expect a return
 Scarfield: i will extrapolate that, and assume i should be 1st
 Astrobytes: true
 Astrobytes: lol Scarfield
 eulerscheZahl: i'm off. back to normal (=working) tomorrow&#160;:(
 digitalix-ai: Great, if it'll be soon! I only reached the bronze league, didn't have enough time...
 struct: gn
 Scarfield: im off as well, gn folks&#160;:)
 struct: gn
 Astrobytes: gn Scarfield and eulerscheZahl
 olimago: Hi there, didnt had much time for this contest, the last one I did was #30 legend for Xmas Rush. Anybody have a recommendation for a past contest&#160;? Something with few math like a board game or something like that (already done heartstone, overcooked and xmas rush)
 struct: do you like board games?
 olimago: Yep&#160;! Ideally something like that
 struct: have you played spring challenge 2021?
 struct: no math needed there at all
 ddreams: I liked that one 
 ddreams: The Fall 2020 is also a board game, but it wasn't so enjoyable imo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the bomberman one mayme olimago
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er maybe
 olimago: ok thanks i'll take a look, I also noted photosynthesis and kingdomino which could be nice
 struct: 2021 is photosynthesis
 Astrobytes: Photosynthesis was Spring 2021
 struct: You can also check postmortems, I describe my bitboard structure there
 olimago: ah right,^^ thanks sounds like a match then ^^
 Astrobytes: also Onitama, and any number of classic board games in the multis these days
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what is the name of the bomberman one, i wanted to go back and redo it
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Hypersonic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kewl, tx
 Astrobytes: np
 cegprakash: just read jujurocking's legend 29 strat
 cegprakash: he was passing monster from a hero to another hero into a double wind
 cegprakash: he was basically playing fantastic bits
 cegprakash: lmao
 Astrobytes: there was a strong FB feel as the contest progressed, that's true
 cegprakash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/39">https://forum.codingame.com/t/spring-challenge-2022-feedbacks-strategies/195736/39</a> my post mortem
 Astrobytes: I read it&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: #90th ain't bad man, well done
 pmor: grats ceg...I was just happy to make legend
 Astrobytes: nice one pmor&#160;:)
 cegprakash: lol lukasjapan had a midfielder and a keeper in his strat
 cegprakash: literally everyone playing this like fantstic bits
 cegprakash: lmao
 Link_jon: Pythoned
 pandaburger: Quick question about c#, is "Event" an ok class name or do I have to rename that to avoid reserved keywords?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey pandaburger, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 Mindarius: take taco
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 ddreams: @pandaburger there are no capital letter keywords in C#
 ddreams: I would probably avoid the word event anyway though, since it's used for handling different types of events
 ddreams: Also it's very generic with many meanings
 struct: var_events
 struct: done
 ddreams: class var_events {
 ddreams: interesting suggestion
 Astrobytes: BusinessLogicEventClass
 Astrobytes: Java style :sunglasses:
 Astrobytes: You can then have BusinessLogicEventClassHandler, BusinessLogicEventClassListener, etc
 ddreams: Don't forget managers
 Astrobytes: yes indeed
 ddreams: BusinessLogicEventClassListenerManager etc
 Badoobicus: BusinesslLogicEventClassHandlerService
 Astrobytes: good point also
 ddreams: And obviously factories to create them
 Astrobytes: Naturally
 ddreams: BusinesslLogicEventClassHandlerServiceManagerFactory
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I thin kkI'm goinf insane
 ddreams: Perhaps you're having a stroke?
 Astrobytes: whaddya mean "going"&#160;?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm writing weird code
 Astrobytes: Patrick, of COURSE you are writing "weird code", you use PHP
 PatrickMcGinnisII: example:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f1d4f2d-b795-442a-a536-69485a53bb90">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3f1d4f2d-b795-442a-a536-69485a53bb90</a>
 ddreams: It's like PHP and Perl had a baby
 struct: calculateSpiderCollisionBaseRadius(Spider&amp; s)
 Astrobytes: That's abhorrent
 struct: short name
 struct: :D
 Astrobytes: @Patrick
 Astrobytes: lol struct, that's SmitsCase
 Badoobicus: are spaces illegal in PHP?
 Astrobytes: PHP IS illegal
 Astrobytes: ddreams: hahaha 100%
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I can make it run faster
 Astrobytes: By chasing it?
 5DN1L: :joy:
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's just so wierd that this is where my brain went first, i think CG is reprogramming me
 ddreams: The end result of too much PHP
 ddreams: Tragic, really
 Astrobytes: ^ this
 ddreams: Such a promising individual.. corrupted
 Astrobytes: Patrick, I have told you so many times, go back to C
 Astrobytes: Keep your PHP for puzzles if you must
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think Imma go back to java since the referees and such are more easily simmed
 Astrobytes: c# would be a better choice imo if you want to go that route
 ddreams: I like prototyping in Python and then moving to C++... for this contest I just stuck with Python since I did zero search and zero sim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm still insane af tho&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: ofc :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: PY would put me in a straight jacket
 ddreams: Maybe that's for the best
 Astrobytes: lol, he may use PHP but he ain't quite *that* bad :D
 ddreams: Have you already forgotten the code? :D
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: fair point :D
 <b>**PatrickMcGinnisII adds a dash of prozac to his :coffee:</b>
 Astrobytes: try meth!
 Astrobytes: I mean, sugar!
 ddreams: Reminds me of my sugar rush and subsequent sugar crash teammates during the ACM competitions in Uni
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I use Monkfruit sugar, meth..bahahaha... enough of that in redneck ville central FL already
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my father was an addictions professional councelor, i told him it takes a crazy person to recognize a crazy person
 PatrickMcGinnisII: He suggested I go to sex addicts anonymous ... I think I know where I get my sense of humor from
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 2 puzzles down
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: brilliant
 Astrobytes: yeah ddreams, sugar is overrated as a stimulant
 Astrobytes: anyway, out for tonight, see you all later
 ddreams: ciao
 PatrickMcGinnisII: "be good, or be good at it"
 struct: gn
 ddreams: btw, thanks for the 4x wind replay struct
 ddreams: helped me implement it in my bot
 ddreams: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/631222960">https://www.codingame.com/replay/631222960</a>
 struct: np
 struct: I just copied the idea from someone else
 ddreams: Mine is slightly buggy though
 ddreams: Sometimes it pushes it outside the range of the gang
 ddreams: Yeah, I saw the idea several times too, but didn't get it right myself
 EvModder: lol my rank was 63 when contest closed but in post-contest reruns I dropped to 197
 EvModder:&#160;:/
 EvModder: to be fair, i didnt actually work on my bot at all the last 3 days so im kind of surprised i was still that high at the end
 PatrickMcGinnisII: euler said bots running same code were +/- 100 ranks
 EvModder: yeah
 EvModder: this contest had wayy too much randomness
 EvModder: it made it really hard to know if changes were improvments or detrimental
 EvModder: like, i'd improve my fog of war calculus and then suddenly lose 60 rating
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i agree, i couldn't nail down my bot states to run a decent sim
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i ran 4 attacking states and 4 defending states among the heros, but each state wasn't optimal, like the default board positions were close, but hard to nail down ... so I would rerun each change ...I thiink if i ran MC offline 1M times it still wouldn't have helped
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i ran some spawn heatmaps, not a total loss, but still a huge waste of time
 EvModder: yeah; the optimal strategy depends a lot on spider spawns and what strategy the opponent uses
 struct: ddreams how did you calculate where to send the spider before you casted the triple wind?
 EvModder: i wasted first 5 days of contest in wood league trying to crack seed before giving up due to the huge state space... I concluded it couldn't be done
 EvModder: but then turns out someone managed to do it lol
 struct: But he also stated it wasnt a big advantage
 EvModder: i think it would have been if he had used other legend league meta
 EvModder: he stated he did not use shield at all
 EvModder: also he never used wind defensively
 EvModder: because if he used wind on turn%==0 it would be tricky to know which mobs spawned that turn would get their random direction affected
 ddreams: I tried to calculate the resulting position, and see if that was in range of the heroes. Looped 360 angles like you said
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I tracked mobs whether they were visible or not with a health decay to decide if I should go in for the kill ... didn't work great, but it worked
 EvModder: the other thing with cracking the seed that he mentions (but didnt use) is you can actually control it a bit
 ddreams: I tried to add the spider's movement, though I'm not sure they're applied after wind?
 EvModder: like, you can get new spiders to move in a certain way, or only use wind to push a spider out of your base if it's new random direction will be away from you (or toward enemy) etc etc
 EvModder: lots of potential
 struct: it doesnt
 struct: after you push a spider it doesnt move
 EvModder: ya, not until next turn
 ddreams: Right, thought so... though it's part of my gold to legend last minute submit :D 
 Darleanow: hello guys&#160;!!
 Darleanow: i had a question concerning truncation
 Darleanow: when i try to print json data, (its an anime synopsis) , its truncated with [...], how can i remove this and print everything&#160;?
 ddreams: Which language?
 Darleanow: py&#160;:)
 ddreams: You're not using print then?
 Darleanow: print(str(json.dumps(z['results'][1]['synopsis'])))
 Darleanow: this is how i return results
 EvModder: wait, i have a question
 EvModder: for any CQ admins lol
 EvModder: CG*
 EvModder: i was wondering if there were shirts for spring2020
 ddreams: Does it have an infinite loop?
 ddreams: I mean, a cycle
 ddreams: "The ordinary print() also uses ellipses but for displaying recursive data structures, which form a cycle, to avoid stack overflow error"
 Darleanow: no, it's taken from a dict 
 Darleanow: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d37b91b7-fcb6-46a3-b4bc-93ca5262b47b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d37b91b7-fcb6-46a3-b4bc-93ca5262b47b</a>
 Darleanow: this is what i get
 Darleanow: from this&#160;: z=jikan.search('anime', a)
 Darleanow: then i try to print synopsis 
 Darleanow: ah nvm
 Darleanow: i'm just.... stupid
 Darleanow: sorry bothering you
 ddreams: :D np
 Darleanow: but i don't know why it is truncated &gt;:'(
 ddreams: Probably need to use another API method
 Darleanow: aww man ToT
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 puzzles down
 ddreams: Try using getAnimeById when you know the id
 ddreams: @Darleanow
 Darleanow: oh thanks&#160;!
 Darleanow: z=jikan.search('anime', a)o=json.dumps(z['results'][1]['mal_id'])m=(jikan.anime(o))print(json.dumps(m['synopsis']))
 Darleanow: fixed with this&#160;:)
 omoussao: can we continue playing the challenge after it is finished?
 ItsNotABug: Hopefully they turn it into a multiplayer
 ItsNotABug: My bot was still terrible due to lack of time. Would like to go back over it eventually. It was a good game
 omoussao: hoping so
 uchiha21: any tips on getting better at coding? i find even the easy challenges to be hard
 ItsNotABug: youtube? stackoverflow?
 ItsNotABug: codingame is more about applying and enhancing rather than learning tbh
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 4 puzzles done today

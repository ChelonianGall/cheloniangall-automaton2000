 dbdr: must be system dependent
 dbdr: no big deal
 eulerscheZahl: it is, we noticed that in the OoC preparation already
 eulerscheZahl: how many chars to allow for messages I think
 eulerscheZahl: i'm about to push an update. larger replays should load a little faster
 dbdr: nice
 eulerscheZahl: still slow, just not THAT slow anymore :D
 eulerscheZahl: turns out that cloning objects with newObj = { ...oldObj, some stuff you replace }is slow
 dbdr: very cool that you improve the perf!
 eulerscheZahl: and it's live
 eulerscheZahl: also getting around the SDK a little more
 eulerscheZahl: also learning for my other project that you haven't seen yet
 eulerscheZahl: slow loading is always annoying

 Illedan: Hi
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 MSmits: hi
 Illedan: Oh, kovi above me too now
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i disclosed your screenshot you send me in private
 dbdr: hey Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: now everyone knows you use the bottom right corner
 Illedan: I have 2 different snakes&#160;;)
 MSmits: snakes?
 Illedan: Depending on where the tile will spawn at the round where you can get 131k tile :P
 dbdr: oh, that's a good idea :D
 Illedan: :P
 dbdr: MSmits: snake shape
 MSmits: oh
 Illedan:         public int[] Neigh = new int[] { 0, 0, 1, 2, 
 dbdr: for 2048
 MSmits: sounds advanced
 Illedan: Not really if you played the game
 Illedan: I added that before I had a functioning search xD
 MSmits: I havent, much. I doubt I got past bunny shape
 dbdr: potato shape
 eulerscheZahl: snake, even I can get something that remotely resembles that<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/ux47p7">https://prnt.sc/ux47p7</a>
 dbdr: animal is more advanced
 kovi: dbdr are you hardcoding? (kinda)
 dbdr: I test offline
 Illedan: I found that you can get above 40 mill with only 3 directions too :D 
 kovi: nice
 eulerscheZahl: tuning some params per testcase already?
 dbdr: yeah
 kovi: yes i guessed so
 kovi: but i dont play that game
 Illedan: Same
 eulerscheZahl: i should drop 1 action from my sim then :D
 MSmits: it's a great game
 Illedan: This game is so 2 days ago.
 kovi:&#160;:)
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl do you have any advice for checkers. I suck at this game
 eulerscheZahl: you had some fun with it, i'll call that a victory for the contribution
 Illedan: Ofc
 eulerscheZahl: nah, my checkers is stupid minimax
 Illedan: I used one whole afternoon + got distacted at work. GJ
 eulerscheZahl: failing to attack even if i would win by sacrificing 1 or 2 stones
 MSmits: i tried stupid minimax, it didnt get above your minimax even though it was c++ and used TT + AB
 MSmits: well probably same strength as yours
 eulerscheZahl: i have alpha beta toono TT
 MSmits: TT didnt seem to help much anyway
 MSmits: I got it working, improved my eval, got it all the way to the same rank as my mcts-like version. Then put the eval in that old bot at it's better&#160;:(
 MSmits: and
 MSmits: I can never get a negamax that's better than a mcts-type bot
 eulerscheZahl: you are submitting
 eulerscheZahl: how dare you destabilizing a perfect ecosystem?
 MSmits: sorry :P
 dbdr: a perfect ecosystem is at equilibrium
 dbdr: cannot be destabilized
 MSmits: what he said
 <b>**eulerscheZahl slaps dbdr around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: maybe I should  just fit my parameters for the mcts version. Get as high as possible and then counterbook the top 3. Seems to work on other games
 MSmits: I have no idea how these guys at the top 3 get so strong
 eulerscheZahl: level up your social engineering
 MSmits: mmh you mean nicely ask them&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes :D
 MSmits: dbdr doesn't remember :P
 Zikyyyyy: hello fellas
 Zikyyyyy: hows it goin
 MSmits: hi fella
 MSmits: ok, just coding
 MSmits: and following the 2048 safa
 MSmits: saga
 dbdr: soap opera?
 Zikyyyyy: im just goin through intro
 Zikyyyyy: learning 
 MSmits: soap opera works too
 MSmits: thats cool Zikyyyyy
 Zikyyyyy: Was studing IT school, but it was a while since last "codin session" :D
 Zikyyyyy: tryin to learn on my ow

 eulerscheZahl: got messy in the end :D
 eulerscheZahl: did you notice a speedup in loading btw?
 dbdr: yes
 eulerscheZahl: nice
 dbdr: ah, was reponding to the previous message
 dbdr: I need to reload
 eulerscheZahl: i half-feared that race condition in the answer :D
 dbdr: :D
 dbdr: still slow, but yes it seems better&#160;:+1:
 eulerscheZahl: still a lot of data to process and generate
 eulerscheZahl: all the animations are loaded before the viewer gets responsive
 eulerscheZahl: which isn't optimal, now that I'm thinking of it
 eulerscheZahl: but too deeply buried to touch 
 kovi: how many tests above 3m?
 dbdr: 1
 dbdr: you?
 kovi: 1 in ide testsbut i meant final tests, which i havent checked
 dbdr: ide is the same as validators
 kovi: oh
 kovi: didnt even looked
 dbdr: there is a display bug in the results window
 dbdr: off by one
 eulerscheZahl: you mean the "random"?
 eulerscheZahl: i blame CG for it
 dbdr: yes, and all shifted. understood that it's CG's bug
 AntiSquid: are you doing any more CTFs euler? :P
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have anything planned
 eulerscheZahl: but i enjoyed it, so maybe if you find a good one...
 eulerscheZahl: but i sucked in all categories except coding&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: you earned points that's the goal
 eulerscheZahl: i had fun, that's the goal
 wlesavo: lol illedans 3 action heuristic works :slight_smile: easy + 10M with a freakin bruteforce
 AntiSquid: what heurisitc?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/LHtBD7w">https://imgur.com/a/LHtBD7w</a>this one was a cool challengesolve it in 3s to get the next level
 eulerscheZahl: or reset the counter to 0
 wlesavo: AntiSquid never go down 
 dbdr: 3s?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 seconds
 AntiSquid: they had a really complicated one in a previous year&#160;: solve captchas in 3 seconds ... multiple onesbut with that kind of program you can basically solve most captchas :D
 eulerscheZahl: would give you the link but it seems down now
 AntiSquid: i've read the write up for that
 eulerscheZahl: sounds fun. i plan to try it again next year
 dbdr: I mean, how can you solve it in 3d? is it automated?
 eulerscheZahl: of course
 AntiSquid: there are donzens of ctfs, i just skimmed over a few before this
 eulerscheZahl: and numpy failed me on it
 eulerscheZahl: refused to solve for a non-square matrix
 eulerscheZahl: more equations than variables
 dbdr: wlesavo improving&#160;:+1:
 dbdr: you still use MC?
 wlesavo: dbdr 3 actions now :smiley:
 wlesavo: bruteforce
 dbdr: ah, full search? how deep?
 wlesavo: 7
 wlesavo: it could be optimised from what i having, but 3 actions lets for a bit deeper search. i think game could be solved on around 8-10 depth
 Illedan: Define solved
 dbdr: reach perfect score
 wlesavo: well 2+4+8+16...+2^16
 dbdr: 8-10 is far from enough, I think
 Illedan: You need a depth of 100 to get the max score
 dbdr: you're mixing things up
 kovi: more than 100 on 1 certain test
 dbdr: you could do several depth 10 searches per turn
 wlesavo: but thats a bold guessing from what i see now
 Illedan: ah, true
 wlesavo: yeah, you probably right, im just not there yet
 dbdr: you're not that far though
 wlesavo: hitting 65k at 600 turn with depth 7 and 3 actions, hm. yeah, for perfect a lot should line up, 100 might be not enough, but still it feels like depth 9-10 should be able to go a long way
 geppoz: "3 actions" means?
 dbdr: ULR
 geppoz: any reason for doing that?
 wlesavo: фддщцы ащк вуузук ыуфкср фтв нщг вщте куфддн туув ше гтешд ыщьу зщште
 wlesavo: oh
 wlesavo: allows for deeper search and you dont really need it until some point
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/ux5co8">https://prnt.sc/ux5co8</a>did you write English to a Russian layout?

 dbdr: :D
 dkov: what can I do, if the standard error stream, started to only show: `...'
 Illedan: Nice dbdr, swapping snake helped?
 dbdr: no, haven't done that yet
 dbdr: will keep it as an option if any of you threaten me&#160;;)
 Illedan: :P
 Illedan: Dont count on me
 eulerscheZahl: you should stop at a score of 67108864
 eulerscheZahl: that's 2^26, don't exceed it
 eulerscheZahl: dkov there's not much you can do about it except printing less
 dbdr: I only know the 2^(2^N)
 dbdr: and 2^N for N &lt;= 16
 dbdr: surprised you know 2^26
 eulerscheZahl: i'm talking about a total score for 30 validators (not a power of 2)
 eulerscheZahl: just giving a random number that would be nice to see as a score on the leaderboard of this game
 eulerscheZahl: or half of it for wlesavo
 dbdr: it's only nice if you know what 2^26 is
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's what you meant
 eulerscheZahl: i used python to calculate it :D
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even sure if i can get up to 2^16 at the top of my head
 eulerscheZahl: till 4096 it's fine, then i have to think a bit
 dbdr: but you would recognize 32768
 dbdr: useful to know what fits in a signed short&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: of course, i recognize it
 eulerscheZahl: but can't tell if it's 32768 or 678 or something when i don't see it
 kovi: huh, 62m?picked a random 3m+?
 eulerscheZahl: did you get the 3m on the same testcase before he improved further?
 kovi: hmm, i thought it is not possible to go above 60m, but it seems it is (22*1.74+6*2.8+2*3.4)

 geppoz: y
 eulerscheZahl: i never played doom
 geppoz: you too young :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: doom still runs in DOSBOX, fun
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the engine was nice for it's time
 Shadowtick: I played doom 1,2 and 3 because I found the games and everything to play them
 Shadowtick: :3
 Shadowtick: I hate doom 2016
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i believe it was compiled w/ DJGPP 16-bit of course
 Shadowtick: yes it was actually
 Shadowtick: they used to only have 8-bit plus 16-bit games back when doom 1 and 2 came out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: modeX graphics were actually a thing
 Shadowtick: I know but some games wouldnt be able to use that
 Shadowtick: idk why they couldn't
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I did alot of matrix transformations in asm back then, z- ordering, etc.  *sigh*
 Shadowtick: ok
 Shadowtick: but I am good at coding on p5.js
 Shadowtick: and I am trying to make a game on it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: inline asm in C++ was very powerful back then, back when coders weren't lazy because Pentiums weren't quite as common
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm too old for this conversation
 eulerscheZahl: and don't even clean up the garbage myself anymore
 eulerscheZahl: thank you managed code &lt;3
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need a bot to change the cat box
 jacek: :3
 Astrobytes: just done mine, and the little bugger promptly shat in it and walked off. Didn't even cover it&#160;:/
 eulerscheZahl: mine does her business outside
 PatrickMcGinnisII: better than the tile in the foyer, listening to one of my cats (who is blind) trying to cover it up reminds me of CG somehow
 eulerscheZahl: enough neighbors to cover
 Astrobytes: my eldest used to, but she doesn't go out much nowadays
 eulerscheZahl: corona lockdown?&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Nah, she doesn't like it up here since I moved 
 Astrobytes: Used to have a huge garden with a big tree and lots of places to hide
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 Shadowtick: aight imma head out
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my GF came over last night and my animals (3 cats and a dog) all cock blocked me...little shits
 Astrobytes: PatrickMcGinnisII: Mines scratches the floor, wall and sometimes in mid air. That's her definition of covering it
 eulerscheZahl: when mine was still new, she had the freedom to go outside but didn't quite understand the conceptso she came inside to go to toilet and then outside again right away
 Astrobytes: hehe, my friends cat still does that after many years
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have a cat door ... use it you lil sumbitches
 eulerscheZahl: mine was always completely dusted afterwards
 Shadowtick: see you I am gonna be coding in p5.js or editing a khan academy game spin-off I have
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok Shadowtick glhf
 PatrickMcGinnisII: people shake their heads about php, that's how i feel about JS
 Astrobytes: my previous cat before this pair couldn't figure out getting back inside via the cat flap
 mgajda: anyone knows keybinding to run all tests in the CodinGame editor? Or is this chat corona-only?
 Astrobytes: that's not exactly a nice way to ask for help
 Astrobytes: :P
 mgajda: can you please kindly give me a pointer towards the possible keybinding to run all the tests. Please, please, please
 eulerscheZahl: ctrl+enter for one testctrl+shift+enter did something too
 eulerscheZahl: i forgot if it's all tests or submit
 PatrickMcGinnisII: keybinding, editor has changed, but clicking run all testcases usually works fine
 mgajda: (I use VS Code all day, but did not find a solution quickly.)
 Astrobytes: ^ second one runs all
 mgajda: (obviously my VS Code is non-default config, maybe that is why)
 Astrobytes: If you right click and check the command palette it's in there I think
 mgajda: Thanks! I want to live without clicking, less RSI
 Astrobytes: True
 mgajda: and thanks for "Command palette" pointer.
 mgajda: and sorry for rough question, we are all spoiled by the good UIs we get daily, and get enraged when we cannot find command palette&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: All good&#160;:)
 mgajda: or am I only one with the anger-control problem when UI is anything less intuitive than reading my mind?
 Astrobytes: No, it happens lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no untrigger suggest, stupid box pisses me off
 mgajda: yep, found keybindings, so the command palette is only one I needed to make it work&#160;:-)
 Astrobytes: Awesome. Handy for assigning Ctrl-S to something other than save in my case lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: spam to follow, me thinks
 mgajda: yeah, that is the one I will assign to "run tests" next. (I usually have `build --file-watch` setup.)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh :3 is a cat face smile...smh, i feel so dumb
 Astrobytes: You can run CG-local and automate everything that way
 Astrobytes: At least then you are in your own IDE
 mgajda: CG-local? Any URL?
 mgajda: do you mean CG-Sync?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rewriting COIF isn't any fun, wth...I was so sloppy the first time thru
 Astrobytes: CG-local is another similar one, think it's for Chrome actually now I think about it
 Astrobytes: thread here:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/cg-local/10359</a>
 Astrobytes: Same PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: alright, afk for a bit. Making flatbreads
 mgajda: still cannot find the command from palette...
 mgajda: what is the editor command name for "Play" or "Play all" command? (One that I can put into keybindings.)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what did ctrl+shift+enter do?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: might just insert a line
 Outjamboned: Hi , I just beat the Boss of Onitama but i dont get the quest "puzzle of the eek" completed
 Einwickler: Im pretty sure you will get it after some time. I spent some time on Onitama yesterday and got the achievement an hour afterI beat the boss I guess.
 Einwickler: So just be patient&#160;:)
 Outjamboned: Ok , thank you&#160;:)
 Einwickler: Did you just beat the boss once or did you get promoted to the next league? I was also promoted after some time so maybe thats important too
 Outjamboned: I was promoted to Wood 1
 mgajda: yeah, it ctrl-shift-enter works in standard keybindings, but I do not see how to check them. In Vim keybindings it just inserts a line&#160;:-)
 mgajda: @PatrickMcGinnisII
 Einwickler: Outjamboned so then just spend some more time on this and Im pretty certain you will get the achievement soon

 CopperFr: it's a crazy crazy world (Scorpions 1990)
 Armenz: Is there a way to autoindent my code?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Armenz: Aaaah ok. Thanks
 CopperFr: you can use Format document
 Armenz: Where can I find that?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, that's new
 CopperFr: i have that in right click menu
 eulerscheZahl: right click in the editor, command palette
 eulerscheZahl: the old editor didn't have such a feature
 CopperFr: you have multi-cursor too :D
 duckymirror: It doesn't do indent my Rust code though
 eulerscheZahl: i have an offline IDE&#160;;)
 CopperFr: perhaps it's not in all languages
 duckymirror: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: worked the the C# code where I just broke formatting on purpose
 duckymirror: I sometimes open VS Code, paste my code, format it and paste it back into the online editor :smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i code in my offline IDE and then copy-paste it here
 duckymirror: Coding online is much more comfortable with the new editor
 duckymirror: I mean it's more comfortable than with the old editor
 CopperFr: yes the online editor is ok
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only thing i miss is right click paste
 eulerscheZahl: don't you usually use ctrl+v?
 CopperFr: i prefer ctrl+v
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i few things i don't like about new editor as well, but I've been told to shutup and like it, basically
 eulerscheZahl: i hate it when i close the autocomplete with escape and the editor loses focus entirely
 CopperFr: it's strange there is Copy / Cut but not Paste
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i like having options, i drink coffee with left hand, etc.  i know, wierd
 AntiSquid: from a left handed mug?
 CopperFr: ah yes the editor don't do coffee it's a problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I got it at the left hand mug store
 PatrickMcGinnisII: gheesh, rewriting COIF, got all my pretty new data structures setup and it plays... 100 lines of code to print "MSG Are we having fun yet\n"

 Majeck: eulerscheZahl I bet every single civilization on the face of the earth has thought the same thing
 Majeck: "We're all around and we've built so much, no way people in the future don't know who we were"
 eulerscheZahl: and we still know a lot about ROmans

 Majeck: Putting all of that aside
 Astrobytes: :D

 Shadowtick: I think my ears are bleeding
 PatrickMcGinnisII: take out all the zeros, put them on the end

 geppoz: "take out all the zeros" -&gt; that is already a cycle 0 to 4

 PatrickMcGinnisII: so mine is 4 + a max of 3 more ifs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmm
 geppoz: (but im far from top solutions)
 geppoz: this is my microelectronic soul that tries to emerge :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so you have to do 6 ifs and then assign
 geppoz: 3 to 5 ifs, then 2 to 4 assign
 PatrickMcGinnisII: exaplains why mine runs a hair slower on fuller boards
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i thought about just precomputing a list
 PatrickMcGinnisII: since my code never gets up to 64k
 geppoz: anyway, I did that because I like this things, but with a better evaluation you gain far more that all that code optimizations
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so a 0 is 1, 1 is 2, 2 is 4, 3 is 8, 4 is 16,5 is 32, 6=64,7=128,8=256,9=512,10=1k,11=2k,12=4k,13=8k,14=16k,15=32k, 16=64k...hmmm 16^4 combos
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh no a 0 is 0
 Shadowtick: ... ummmmmmmmm imma just go
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lookup table too big
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, glhf
 MSmits: Shadowtick couldn't handle the Patrick&#160;:(
 jacek: the star?
 geppoz: lookup with all possible value impossible
 geppoz: uhm TBH if you suppose never go over 32678
 geppoz: you can represent every value with 4 bits, so x4cells = 16bits
 MSmits: oh btw, jacek, I misunderstood what you meant by tempo
 Shadowtick: I am easily confused that's why MSmits
 jacek: MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: tempo is how advanced your pieces are. I meant a bonus to the player who's next to move
 jacek: but thats what i mean by temp - a player to move
 MSmits: oh, that's weird, I came across it with the other definition
 Shadowtick: I am gonna edit my bio and put a link to my first song
 Shadowtick: because Idk why
 Shadowtick: why not*
 MSmits: sure
 jacek: you mean breakthrough? i saw a paper that gave some score for the furthest pawn
 Shadowtick: I forgot how to
 MSmits: nah checkers
 MSmits: same idea I suppose
 geppoz: so there will be a an array of 65536 words (16bits)
 jacek: and tempo is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Tempo">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Tempo</a>
 MSmits: you mean parity I think?
 MSmits: When a player achieves a result in one fewer move, he gains a tempo
 jacek: no, just a player to move
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: I'm thinking this is one of those things that are used with different definitions
 jacek: meh
 MSmits: in  any case, I found that giving a bonus or penalty to the player that is next to move is really important in best first search type algos
 Shadowtick: I did it
 MSmits: doesnt matter in minimax/negamax
 Shadowtick: I added my song to my bio
 jacek: good for you
 MSmits: that's enough productivity out of you this week Shadowtick, relax now
 jacek: does your negamax still oscillate between even odd?
 Shadowtick: ok
 MSmits: nah, that earlier version had tons of bugs
 Shadowtick: I am gonna be done talking for a few minutes
 MSmits: it was on onitama btw, i got all the bugs out and then it was worse tha my mcts version
 MSmits: I got an improvement switching to negamax on checkers, after improving the eval, then i used that eval in my mcts and it was better =/
 MSmits: negamax seems a waste of time for me 
 jacek: at least you improved your eval
 jacek: also, any fancy move ordering?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: I store the best move from an earlier  iteration
 MSmits: search that first
 MSmits: dont remember what thats called
 MSmits: killer move, history&#160;? dunno
 MSmits: seemed to make sense
 jacek: best move from previous principal variation
 MSmits: not exactly
 MSmits: I store everying in TT
 MSmits: take the best move out of there
 MSmits: so not just the PV, 
 jacek: oh right, not only pv
 jacek: just best move from previous iteration
 MSmits: yea
 MSmits: not sure if this is the standard way to do it
 jacek: it is
 MSmits: well then I figured it out. I guess it was too much to hope for to get some actual improvement over mcts. I spent 2 years perfecting coding that.
 MSmits: i'm still a newbie at negamax
 jacek: killer move is about taking best move of the same level
 jacek: i.e. if b2c3 is best in one situation, it may be best in similar one
 MSmits: yeah i guess that works for games where the overall board structure stays the same during the search
 MSmits: but if the board changes wildly after every move, kller move doesnt work
 jacek: like bt, but i think checkers too
 MSmits: maybe yeah
 MSmits: not onitama i think though
 MSmits: with all the card switching and the few pieces
 Shadowtick: hey i'm back
 jacek: welcome back
 Shadowtick: gtg eat dinner
 Shadowtick:&#160;;-;
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, rewrote my 40 lines of code
 PatrickMcGinnisII: breaktime
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 tobk: What's that new contest? Rerun of Code of Ice and Fire?
 Majeck: Yep
 Astrobytes: Not a rerun, just informal 'see how much you can improve'
 Astrobytes: (if you have a bot already)
 Shadowtick: hey
 Shadowtick: im back
 maras: is there a way to check memory usage in CG?
 Majeck: Not that I know of
 Majeck: You can check the ms it takes to run your program though
 Majeck: Hey in the "Counting Squares on Pegs" what does it mean when it says that: "Note that we do not require the squares to be axis-aligned."?
 Majeck: Is it saying that the squares don't need to be squares, ergo they're actually quadrilaterals?
 Majeck: Or is it referring to them not needing to be in a "grid"
 LastRick: Look at PetrKlic's image in the community discussion for the puzzle: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/counting-squares-on-pegs/49637/31">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/counting-squares-on-pegs/49637/31</a>
 Majeck: Oh
 Majeck: Thanks you just saved me a lot of wasted time lol
 LastRick: Np
 Sunkin351: In recent years, the C# language has evolved quite a bit, and I'm wondering what version of the language this place is using.
 Sunkin351: The presence of Span&lt;T&gt; Indicates this is C# 7.2+ and I'm very happy about that.
 Schwase: im sure there are specifics available somewhere
 Schwase: id check the forums if youd like a definite answer
 DaNinja: versions are in the faq <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Sunkin351: C# 8, compiled with unsafe code on... Sweet.
 Sunkin351: For the project "Unique Prefixes", I was lead to believe the same string of letters would not appear twice, yet in the 7th test case, there are 2 and 3 identical strings. Can someone explain this?

 Tubbo_: cool
 ProCoder03:&#160;??
 Tubbo_: ik I'm sad&#160;;-;
 Tubbo_: anyway goodbye I am leaving this world

 KiwiTae: i do C too 
 Westicles: too late, he ded
 Jumong: hey 
 Phoenix.: hello everyone
 ericlovesmath: When I'm doing leetcode problems in Python, should I preallocate lists for Python just for readability / easier to translate to other languages?
 ericlovesmath: Yes I'm aware that in Python this is pointless
 zhenming: hi
 derjack: huh? martinpapa69 didnt submit to oware in over 24h :o
 xlr4829: huh???
 ProCoder03: Can someone explain Chuck Norris, 
 ProCoder03: please???

 culetto: How do I change my programming language in Clash of Code?
 Uljahn: there is a drop-down menu at the top-left of IDE
 ZywOo: use google chrome and click "translate this page"
 culetto: Awesome, thanks Uljahn
 ParinZ: Is there vim-mode?
 TRYHARDUS: you smell

 Razor.Blaze7: hey guys is this supposed to be helpful for absolute beginners?
 Razor.Blaze7: it sent me to a clash of code that i knew absolutely nothing about and i just typed "what the heck is this bruh"
 MSmits: how come you don't know that bredda?
 Razor.Blaze7: i don't know anything about coding and i thought i could start learning here
 MSmits: ahh
 MSmits: well
 MSmits: you can learn here
 MSmits: but not from 0
 MSmits: it is expected you know the basics
 MSmits: like, loops, conditions, functions and the syntax of at least 1 language\
 Razor.Blaze7: oh....
 derjack: oh my
 Razor.Blaze7: where did you guys learn this stuff?
 MSmits: i taught myself while modding games mostly
 Razor.Blaze7: outside of school or college i mean
 MSmits: but there's easier ways than that
 MSmits: tons of free python courses out there
 MSmits: or some other language
 Razor.Blaze7: kinda wanted some recommendations to learn python from scratch but i guess i'll google it
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.learnpython.org/">https://www.learnpython.org/</a>

 WakimMRT: my home is nigthtime
 tealfrog: Any hint where can I find full info on regexp ranges? Is it asci order?
 tealfrog: I am surprised [0-z] range in python includes&#160;:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`
 Xaniouks: Part of regular ASCII table
 Xaniouks: nothing surprising as 0 - z is 48 - 122
 tealfrog: My intention is to match [a-zA-Z0-9], no underscore hence I cannot use \w
 gilufin: you can use the i flag
 tealfrog: It is clear from ASCI table, I was looking into string.printable which is not in ASCI order
 tealfrog: thanks gilufin
 tealfrog: and Xanioks
 Natekrth: Help
 Silambarasan_RD: Hello
 Silambarasan_RD: It seems something wrong with "MANHATTAN with another ASCII representation" test case
 Silambarasan_RD: when I try to console.log the 'ROW' variable inside the loop, the printed letters are not correct.
 Silambarasan_RD: did someone face the same issue?
 KiwiTae: Silambarasan_RD fix your code o/ its working fine
 Silambarasan_RD: Not sure, what do you mean to fix?FYI I'm using javascript "readline()"
 Uljahn: inputs can't be incorrect, probably you've misunderstood the task
 Uljahn: i recall how i failed the first attempt to the puzzle with hardcoding all the ascii arts lol
 Silambarasan_RD: Yes, I understand. but I'm not hardcoding.
 Silambarasan_RD: Is it possible to share screenshot here?
 KiwiTae: share your code its easier~
 KiwiTae: or imgur for images
 Silambarasan_RD: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://ibb.co/PTRxf5K">https://ibb.co/PTRxf5K</a>
 Uljahn: your debug output is too large
 Uljahn: so some part of it is skipped

 Silambarasan_RD: yup, I finished it :innocent:
 KiwiTae: gg
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Hey -- Question: 
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: These are such good learning exercises, but there are lots I can't finish in 15 minutes.  Is there a way I can continue on after the 15 minutes... for no points/credit/whatever... just so I can finish&#160;??
 Wontonimo: nope
 Wontonimo: just do challenges instead
 Wontonimo: like these <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>

 FlatSaxophone_d99a: Bro
 FlatSaxophone_d99a: I just won a coding match
 xxd: thats great
 FlatSaxophone_d99a: In Codechef
 xxd: see above comment
 FlatSaxophone_d99a: That's a contest 
 Plink: @eulerscheZahl ha.  It's a good page, I get a fair bit of use from it.  Thanks!
 FlatSaxophone_d99a: Yes bro
 Wontonimo: watch your language FlatSaxophone_d99a, Br* is not server approved slang on this site.  One more offence and I'll throw a taco at you
 FlatSaxophone_d99a: Ok Sir no problem
 xxd: currently trying to solve The barnyard using np.linalg. will be super satisfied if this works
 KiwiTae: &gt;&lt; anyone else got the Congrats youre in top3 of sogeti contest email :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: oh nice. can you claim your prize now?
 eulerscheZahl: did the use the BCC at least?
 KiwiTae: :joy: i didnt submit a bot ~ they failed the mailing header maybe
 eulerscheZahl: is there a link where you can order the headphones?
 eulerscheZahl: when CG sends tshirt links, it's the same for all 20 winners
 KiwiTae: no just the header is wrong ~ the content is telling me "Whilst the prizes may not be in sight this time, Sogeti are always on the lookout for future stars."
 RoboStac: yeah, I got an email with that subject too. Contents were correct though saying I hadn't won a prize
 KiwiTae: gathering training data is time consuming&#160;:( so lazy
 reCurse: That's why it's the most important part
 Wontonimo: FlatSaxophone_d99a has been rather abusive in private chat

 reCurse: Sadly not abusing me in private chat
 Wontonimo: lol
 1needl3rn: heyo
 Wontonimo: o/
 1needl3rn: i need help im playing the descent and i need destroy mountains
 1needl3rn: i am new 
 1needl3rn:&#160;:(
 xxd: np.linalg.solve is a godsend
 Wontonimo: what programming language are you using?
 1needl3rn: "Go"&#160;?
 Wontonimo: sorry, that's a no go for me
 1needl3rn: which language is better
 1needl3rn: im from argentina
 reCurse: If you can't solve descent chances are you need to learn programming basics elsewhere
 reCurse: This is more of an exercise website than a learning one
 1needl3rn: ooo
 1needl3rn: i see
 Wontonimo: look for a basic course (free) that covers if / while / for / functions
 Wontonimo: and arrays
 1needl3rn: I'm looking at what to study and never in my life have I programmed anything, and I wanted to see what it is like ...
 1needl3rn: i know
 1needl3rn: if and endif&#160;:(
 Shorre: What kinds of things are you interested in programming?
 1needl3rn: more than anything games
 Shorre: Well the two most common programming languages in games are probably C# and C++
 Wontonimo: have you coded anything at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>
 1needl3rn: no
 Wontonimo: i know it isn't "real" programming, but it has all the basics
 Wontonimo: if it is your first week of coding, it's worth checking it out then moving onto go, java, c++, python, javascript 
 Wontonimo: it'll give you a visual of whats going on
 1needl3rn: Which one would you recommend
 Husoski: I semi-disagree.  The Easy puzzles are a good place for beginners to build skills.  But yeah, CG is certainly not W3Schools!
 Shorre: Youre going to get a different answer from pretty much anyone you ask
 1needl3rn: i gtg but
 1needl3rn: im in discor
 1needl3rn: discord
 Wontonimo: to start, i'd recommend the language that you have a couple friends who also are learning.  failing that, the language that you can find a good teacher/ mentor
 ConnorKrakosky: just use basic. it's called basic because it's easy
 MForoutan: david david ooo sss aaa
 Xaniouks: I think I found a bug in scrabble&#160;:/test 8 has two possible solutions, whereas I have the other as the one that is checked. 
 Xaniouks: in the dictionary, both napster and pastern are present, which both have the same letters and thus value.
 Xaniouks: Ah, it says so in the rules&#160;:/
 Xaniouks: mb
 jrke: read rules 
 jrke: `If two words win the same number of points, then the word which appears first in the order of the given dictionary should be chosen.`
 Xaniouks: Yeah found it
 Xaniouks: Thanks
 jrke: np
 jacek: who reads the rules ~
 reCurse: Is anyone interested in chess bot games? Wondering if I should keep posting games from my bot I find interesting or not.
 jacek: talkchess doesn't have that?
 reCurse: I don't know anyone there
 jacek: post here anyway
 jacek: we lost you in that chess hole, so this is a way to stay with us
 jrke: is there 100% accurate chess solver exists?
 Louzy: yes
 reCurse: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lichess.org/study/aHrCG3Ry/CbRjcFDB">https://lichess.org/study/aHrCG3Ry/CbRjcFDB</a>
 reCurse: Didn't give a damn about being down material the whole game
 reCurse: Eval was positive all the way
 reCurse: This is so much harder than anything I've done on CG
 jacek: no opening?
 dbdr: jrke, no, chess is not a solved game
 Arteries: nice, did you use machine learning? 
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: It's the main reason I'm doing this
 reCurse: Tinyzero
 Arteries: that was a pretty impressive game
 reCurse: I'll send the compliments to my bot
 Arteries: like deepmind vs stockfish with two bishops
 Arteries: lol&#160;:)
 jacek: will you ever submit it to cg
 reCurse: Hm
 reCurse: Ever is a long time so I'll say yes
 jrke: that was a great bot
 FalINTOblivion0112: wait you guys use lichess
 FalINTOblivion0112: i love lichess
 reCurse: Thanks
 reCurse: I really enjoy watching the games
 reCurse: Not sure what it's up to most of the time
 dbdr: reCurse, is lichess a good platform for bots?
 dbdr: if I see correctly, your bot is solving some puzzles but not playing official matches?
 reCurse: Oops had no idea I did some stuff on that account
 dbdr: :D
 reCurse: I only posted there so it's easier to watch
 reCurse: No bot activity, not my main account, etc.
 dbdr: ok
 reCurse: I play matches locally with 1sec/move
 reCurse: I don't think it's a good platform for bots because it runs on the player's hardware
 reCurse: So who knows what's actually powering it
 reCurse: But otherwise it's the best platform yes
 reCurse: My only gripe is they GPL'd instead of MIT'd so I can't use any of their code&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: Nice game man&#160;:)
 dbdr: you can use it, you just can't redistribute it
 reCurse: Yeah and then will come the time maybe I want to show something
 reCurse: Out of principle I just never use GPL
 reCurse: I mean libraries ofc
 reCurse: Thx Astrobytes
 dbdr: you would want to include some of their code into your bot?
 dbdr: which part is useful?
 reCurse: The frontend
 reCurse: I was considering using their chessboard for visualization
 reCurse: But it's gpl so
 reCurse: I found alternatives just not as nice
 jrke: btw in cpp does vector[i] works?
 jrke: or i have to do vectors.at(i)
 Astrobytes: [i] works
 Maxim251: How I can include time to count how long take function to proceed?
 Maxim251: Nice wuld be get example

 ESilguero24: I forgot :sob:
 jrke: ESilguero24 just add the text after your command
 martinpapa69:  if(duration.count() &gt; MAX_USE_TIME) return false;
 martinpapa69: wow
 martinpapa69: return duration.count() &lt; MAX_USE_TIME
 jrke: i created this class long ago
 Astrobytes: martinpapa69: he's 14&#160;;)
 reCurse: That's a very minor thing to nitpick about
 ESilguero24: jrke what would that look like?
 ESilguero24: I'm using python btw
 martinpapa69: stuff like this rly hurt my eyes sry
 jrke: ESilguero24 print(x, y, thrust, textMessage)
 MSmits: i did that stuff like a year ago
 ESilguero24: would the message be in quotations?
 ESilguero24: sorry I'm a noob
 MSmits: if(a) return true else return false
 MSmits: never realized i could just directly return the boolean expression
 MSmits: until someone pointed it out
 martinpapa69: ye every1 did that, but after few months, years in programming you find it ugly
 MSmits: the point is not finding it ugly or not
 MSmits: the point is realizing there's an alternative
 MSmits: tons of things are ugly and have no alternative
 martinpapa69: the other thing i love to see:
 martinpapa69: if(a &gt; b) b = a;
 MSmits: whats wrong with that
 martinpapa69: a = max(a, b)
 martinpapa69: i mean
 MSmits: sure if thats all you're doing
 martinpapa69: b = max(a, b) :D 
 jrke: b = max(a, b)
 jrke: yeah
 reCurse: I usually spare my rage for stuff that actually makes no sense
 reCurse: :P
 MSmits: like pie rule
 herosnowman: god I need to up my wpm
 Astrobytes: Your method names trigger me MSmits
 MSmits: ah, they're usually not that bad
 Astrobytes: ThisIsTheMethodThatDoesTheSameAsTheOneAboveButSlightlyDifferent()
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: I only have 1 like that and it's because i ran out of descriptive names :P
 martinpapa69: noo i worked at a company, every1 coded like that
 martinpapa69: ThisMethodAddsTwoIntegersUp
 Astrobytes: ugh
 dbdr: what code from MSmits are you reading Astrobytes?
 Astrobytes: lol, it was from a while back
 Astrobytes: it was worse than structs function parameters

 MSmits: it's totally bitboarded now, no more graph stuff
 Astrobytes: the void pointer one?
 reCurse: y
 Astrobytes: I got no issue with that :D
 martinpapa69: sometimes you just have to use void*
 reCurse: There are only two things I can't stand in this world. People who are intolerant of other people's code. And PHP programmers.
 dbdr: nice :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbdr: being intolerant of their poor choice of language is fine, though&#160;;)

 reCurse: jacek-in-the-box?
 Astrobytes: heh indeed
 jacek: martinpapa69 you havent submitted your bots in 2 days. what happened
 martinpapa69: im working on quantized inference
 xxd: for ultimate tic-tac-toe, where is validActionCount documented?
 xxd: (wood league)
 Astrobytes: Documented? It's the number of valid actions...
 xxd: yeah but is it like a random number etc
 xxd: nevermind i'll figure it out
 jacek: Next validActionCount lines: 2 space separated integers row and col, the coordinates you're allowed to play at.
 jacek: in the... statement :o
 xxd: yeah but what is the valid range of numbers
 jacek: [0..8]
 xxd: oh nice, so one can just win on the first turn possibly?
 jacek: or [0..2] for wood league 
 xxd: that would be me :sunglasses:
 jacek: this is just list of valid actions you can choose at random.
 xxd: oh i completely misunderstood
 jacek: or see if your game simulation is correct
 Astrobytes: No. You can only play a single action per turn. the given valid actions are the range of valid actions you can choose from.
 xxd: oh god
 xxd: i cant read
 xxd: please forgive me
 jacek: never
 xxd: nooooo
 Astrobytes: 1000 Hail Knuths and a week off CG for you

 Noxious12: hello y'all
 TobiasA: :wave:
 xxd: i want to try writing a MCTS but i do not know how long it will take to implement
 xxd: i have never written one before
 xxd: how long can i expect it to take?
 martinpapa69: my first one took a lot. you write simetingm it looks like its working, but its actually not
 martinpapa69: and you just cant find out why
 Astrobytes: Pointer issues, sign errors in backprop, general weirdness&#160;:)
 martinpapa69: :thumbsup:
 xxd: what level of math would be recommended?
 martinpapa69: there is only 1 line of "math" in the mcts algo
 xxd: oh, interesting. guess i have no excuse not to learn it
 Astrobytes: that's the UCT
 Astrobytes: look up UCB1, check how it works. Then that's applied to trees (UCT)
 Astrobytes: (essentially)
 Astrobytes: It's not complicated but there's a rabbit hole there
 Astrobytes: Basic competence with stats will help you
 Astrobytes: imo
 xxd: thank you for the info
 xxd: i am going to take a statistics class this coming year, so maybe i can learn it in tandem

 TobiasA: that looks fun
 Astrobytes: 'Fun' is relative.
 reCurse: Relative to uttt it's fun
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: sorry but not sorry for the ping btw reCurse&#160;:)
 reCurse: np Astrobytes
 xxd: yeah i read the post mortem but its so complex and i'm not that good
 Astrobytes: Keep it simple, start from the simplest things
 TobiasA: it is funny the number of possible emotions one could pass across with this emoji:slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: for everything else there is /{x}
 xxd: i'm experiencing some lag in the GUI battle viewer, I'm on SD not HD. any other tips?
 Astrobytes: Refresh.
 reCurse: Print less logs
 Astrobytes: Close most other things.
 TobiasA: close the browser
 xxd: 500iq
 xxd: Would it be possible by chance to view a text form of the battle vs in the browser GUI?
 TobiasA: print every variable in the game

 xxd: Is the technique described in this video in agreement with the papers on MCTS? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXW2yZndl7U</a>
 xxd: doesn't look _that_ hard
 TobiasA: aaayyy that's the same video i watched today
 xxd: nice
 TobiasA: i also said it didn't look hard:cry:
 xxd: did u try implementing it?
 TobiasA: and now my tron bot that uses minimax is addicted to suicide
 TobiasA: again
 xxd: damn
 TobiasA: i wanted to use mcts but i decided to start with something more simple
 Hoyer: CSB leaderboard is fake
 xxd: wym?
 reCurse: Probably referring to the fact a large portion of it is flattened by repeated submits of top bots
 reCurse: Otherwise idk
 Wontonimo: That MCTS video is very good.  It describes only single player or cooperative situations.  Like minmax with the min.
 Wontonimo: To handle adversarial play, one way to do that is to update a nodes score with respect to the players move that the node represents
 Wontonimo: during the backprop phase.  Otherwise it is identical iirc
 reCurse: I have a hard time grasping mcts and the non-stationary nature of adversarial
 reCurse: Or at least trusting it
 Hoyer: What I mean is that my last submit was years ago and it reached #25 at the highest point. Then I check a few months ago and it was around #30 which made sense to me, since more people would've joined. Now it's #16 with no change, and I see some bots I remember as within top 10, being top 30+ now :thinking:
 Hoyer: It seems a bit too random
 Hoyer: Most importantly I see some bots that I am sure are superior to my own in lower positions, and it weirds me out
 reCurse: CG leaderboards are skewed to whoever submits more often
 reCurse: And since the top 4 easily 100% everyone else, it flattens the scores and creates the disparity you noticed
 reCurse: Well I guess Yurkov also made a little league of his own since as well
 reCurse: So yeah in a nutshell they're mostly bad
 reCurse: The leaderboards I mean
 reCurse: Hmm I can't decide between getting an intel 11900k now or wait for 12900k in november
 Hoyer: I guess it makes sense when you explain it like that
 BlaiseEbuth: Are the reports of old semi-private contest available somewhere?
 V-VOLT: waiting for lash

 TechTheAwesome: hii,  anyone here can help me with the easy/how time flies puzzle? Not too sure how to go about debugging when passing all IDE test but failed one on submit
 5DN1L: Which one?
 TechTheAwesome: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/how-time-flies">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/how-time-flies</a>
 TechTheAwesome: this
 5DN1L: no
 5DN1L: I mean which one do you fail?
 5DN1L: which validator
 TechTheAwesome: `Complex`
 TechTheAwesome: should i post my code as well?
 5DN1L: not yet
 5DN1L: Have you tried out the various custom cases here?
 5DN1L: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-how-time-flies/1966/">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-how-time-flies/1966/</a>
 TechTheAwesome: ok let me try
 TechTheAwesome: Well the post talks about the IDE's 1140 days
 TechTheAwesome: so yeah my code passes
 5DN1L: What do you mean?
 5DN1L: Have you fixed your code?
 TechTheAwesome: Oh i mean, I've tried 01.01.2014 -&gt;01.05.2014 = 4 months &amp; 120 days
 TechTheAwesome: 01.01.2014 -&gt; 01.06.2014getting 5 months and 151 days
 TechTheAwesome: so it should be correct but still fails at validator `complex` on submit
 5DN1L: How about 11.03.2000 -&gt; 14.02.2012?
 TechTheAwesome: 11 years, 11 months, total 4357 days
 5DN1L: 11.03.2000 -&gt; 03.02.2012?
 TechTheAwesome: 11 years, 11 months, total 4346 days
 5DN1L: interesting, let me try one more
 5DN1L: 18.05.2000 -&gt; 02.02.2016?
 TechTheAwesome: 15 years, 8 months, total 5738 days
 5DN1L: wow. the last one is almost the same as the validator :joy:
 TechTheAwesome: oh?
 5DN1L: last one
 5DN1L: 12.05.2000 -&gt; 03.02.2016?
 TechTheAwesome: 15 years, 9 months, total 5745 days
 5DN1L: why's that
 TechTheAwesome: also im using rust so perhaps the chrono library might run different on the server?
 5DN1L: hmmm?
 5DN1L: the answer should be:  15 years, 8 months, total 5745 days 
 5DN1L: you got this right:  18.05.2000 -&gt; 02.02.2016? 
 TechTheAwesome: :O
 5DN1L: but you got this wrong:  12.05.2000 -&gt; 03.02.2016? 
 5DN1L: interesting
 5DN1L: please check your code
 TechTheAwesome: you mean my15 years, 9 months, total 5745 days?
 TechTheAwesome: hmmm
 5DN1L: yes, i mean that
 5DN1L: 03.05.2000 -&gt; 03.02.2016 is 15 years 9 months
 5DN1L: 12.05.2000 -&gt; 03.02.2016 is less than 15 years 9 months
 TechTheAwesome: hmmmm
 TechTheAwesome: is the days correct tho?
 5DN1L: What do you mean
 5DN1L: 03.05.2000 -&gt; 03.05.2016 is 16 years
 5DN1L: 3 months back is 03.02.2016
 5DN1L: 16 years - 3 months = 15 years 9 months
 5DN1L: the number of days is correct
 5DN1L: only the number of months is wrong
 TechTheAwesome: yeah.. cause i don't think rust provided month and years conversion
 TechTheAwesome: so I've been doing it by hand :sweat_smile:
 5DN1L: yeah, so check that part of the code :wink:
 gurbytjokr: hellow my fellow nigas

 B.KHALED: zven den 
 KinaKhongs: Hello, is there any puzzle that are bot related ( not to hard )?
 struct: KinaKhongs depends the are some bot programming that are easy to get in to
 struct: but hard to get to the top
 struct: Do you want single player or multiplayer?
 KinaKhongs: I prefer single player to start but if it's multiplayer, i don't care
 KinaKhongs: Just good one to start with
 Crosility: The recommended first pod racing, is exceptionally easy to start-hard to master.
 struct: I would recommend 2048, SameGame, Code vs Zombies and search race
 KinaKhongs: Ok I will try this one then thanks a lot
 struct: All require you to write a sim to play it though
 struct: Maybe not to play but to get to the top
 KinaKhongs: A sim? ^^'
 struct: The engine so you can predict whats happening
 TechTheAwesome: simulation, predicting the future
 struct: whats gonna happen*
 MSmits: you can keep the full state in some kind of datastructure and apply or undo a move. 
 KinaKhongs: oh ok yeah
 KinaKhongs: Thanks :wink:
 amayel: can someone help me understand this "The Descent"?
 amayel: ahi got it now thanks
 5DN1L: If you need more help on that puzzle, you may refer to the hints available by clicking HINTS to the left of the puzzle statement amayel
 amayel: ah sorry, i didn't notice. thanks&#160;:) now i know&#160;:) sorry for the trouble
 5DN1L: it's fine, no worries
 amayel:&#160;:)
 amayel: can i ask?
 5DN1L: sure
 5DN1L: you can ask any coding-related questions here
 amayel: in that clash coding? its intermediate isn't?
 amayel: which is better to learn these days, c# or python?
 tomatoes: js
 5DN1L: depends on what you mean by "better" i guess amayel
 5DN1L: better = easier to learn? better = better for finding jobs? or what
 5DN1L: and i don't understand your question on clash coding. are you asking about the difficulty level of clash of code?
 MSmits: clash of code is basically easier than easy puzzles, but with a time limit. The time limit makes it bad for learning general coding skills though. It's only good for fun or for training speed
 MSmits: if you want to practice just do easy puzzles here:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 amayel:  thank you miss
 amayel: both for learning and for jobs. i guess
 JayyKeyy: it's also good for general problem solving
 amayel: alright&#160;:) thank you for all help&#160;:)
 amayel: i got some codes from net about this "The Descent", is alright to ask it in here?
 amayel: *is it
 5DN1L: as i said, you can ask about any coding-related stuff here
 amayel: i know this is so common, but allow me to ask, about the for loop
 amayel: the second statement inside the for loop, it is boolean right?
 amayel: but is it also just a random numbers, or it must start in 1
 5DN1L: where is the code you are asking about?
 amayel: like for example:  i &lt; 8; in this, using the for loop, does the computer read it start from one or it randomely reads numbers as long as the number is within the range of 1-8?
 amayel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a5ef09d-c33c-4cc3-adf1-81a8cfe6f9e4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a5ef09d-c33c-4cc3-adf1-81a8cfe6f9e4</a>
 amayel: wait. 
 5DN1L: it's fine
 5DN1L: we can see the pastebin
 amayel: so yeah in that code, im trying to understand the flow of it
 amayel: slowly
 5DN1L: "the second statement inside the for loop, it is boolean right?" &lt;- you mean if( a &lt; mountainH)?
 amayel: no it the "for loop"
 amayel: sorry i mean the condition part of the "for loop"
 amayel: for(int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
 amayel: that "i &lt; 8" part
 5DN1L: you declare i = 0 when the loop starts
 5DN1L: the code checks whether i is less than 8
 amayel: yes,
 5DN1L: if yes, it executes the contents inside of the for loop
 amayel: Standard Output Stream: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ab77b8f-1ed4-480d-b5be-51333f202835">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ab77b8f-1ed4-480d-b5be-51333f202835</a>
 5DN1L: then increases i by 1 (i++)
 amayel: as for the game info, why it starts with 3?
 5DN1L: and then it checks whether i is less than 8 again
 5DN1L: 3 is not i
 5DN1L: 3 is another variable
 amayel: which is "b"
 5DN1L: yes
 amayel: so it goes like, 0, be checks whether less or great than 8, then increment to 1, then read this "int mountainH = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());"?
 5DN1L: it goes like i=0, check whether less than 8 or not, readline, then increment to 1
 5DN1L: the order should be like this instead

 5DN1L: you're banned for spamming
 TechTheAwesome: :eyes:
 elie.f.asmar: I am implementing a genetic algorithm for Mars Lander challenge, that requires 500ms in the worst case to converge; which yields to a timeout.I am using Javascript; does the execution time decrease if I switch for C++ or Go?
 elie.f.asmar: Or should I revamp my algorithm to increase convergence
 struct: Yes
 struct: they are faster
 elie.f.asmar: Okay, thank you
 struct: I would choose C++ 
 struct: and then add optimization pragmas to make it even faster
 elie.f.asmar: So the timeout rules that are put in place by moderators does not take into consideration the execution speed of the chosen language
 struct: yeah it doesnt take into account execution speed
 struct: all languages can use the same time
 5DN1L: not moderators exactly...
 elie.f.asmar: not moderators exactly=&gt; I mean challenge creators
 5DN1L: that's more like it&#160;:)
 TechTheAwesome: yeah that happens to me way back when tried to use C# to do some recursive stuff xD some lang just runs slower
 Uljahn: each language is just a tool with its trade-offs in speed, convenience (GC, syntactic sugar) and portability (platform-independent bytecode)

 eulerscheZahl: not solvable. but all 20 validators are
 tibithegreat: oh ok
 eulerscheZahl: an older version of my solver that doesn't solve it offline with more time also gets a score of 19
 tibithegreat: ok, my solution is currently really unoptimized (I mean really stupid) and I was wondering if I can't solve that one because it's not optimized or that's just how it is
 tibithegreat: like I'm doing a beam width of 8 and max depth of 15... and it still timeouts on some validators, time to optimize

 emh: I'm trying to use AVX to do connected components for 6x12 bitboard in Smash the Code
 emh: but now I'm out of energy
 emh: before figuring it out
 SchawnnahJ: sorry 5DN1L

 Scarfield: save your energy for the contest coming soon maybe emh&#160;:)
 5DN1L: SchawnnahJ Please observe the code of conduct, or you may be kicked again or banned
 emh: Scarfield hehe
 emh: you mean next Thursday? Green Circle?
 Scarfield: yup
 SchawnnahJ: OKAY SORRY 5DN1L sorry okay
 SchawnnahJ: and sorry community
 Scarfield: hmm i see why movegen is a pain in backgammon
 SchawnnahJ: an error help plz
 5DN1L: help&#160;?

 struct: emh doesnt seem easy
 struct: and im not sure if its worth it tbh
 SchawnnahJ: I am back here. There was an error saying that I am the owner of the account, and if I predescribed the other tabs on the website, it says there was an error.
 struct: You will need __m256i[2][4] and __m2128[2][2] for the remaining 
 struct: __m128*
 SchawnnahJ: k
 struct: I did try to avx it a bit but I discard the idea pretty quickly 
 emh: struct hmm.. ok. so far I just figured out how to popcount and find first set bit on 16 bytes in parallell
 struct: oh are you writing custom asm for this?
 emh: yes
 struct: ah ok then thats different
 struct: it might work I guess
 struct: What I tried was different so thats why I probably failed
 emh: ahh ok. but I'm not sure what output I should make from the AVX instructions yet
 emh: my non-AVX had 128 bit per output component
 YurkovAS: first set bit: v &amp; -v
 eulerscheZahl: that's the last
 eulerscheZahl: let's say: least significant
 eulerscheZahl: also: your submits scrambled the STC leaderboard
 struct: YurkovAS do you ignore 2nd player?
 struct: or do you run mcts for both?
 YurkovAS: oh, i'm can't improve stc (win all) 
 emh: ohh.. might come in handy. v &amp; -v&#160;:)
 emh: I did something more complicated
 eulerscheZahl: that x &amp; -x is the first thing i learned in the "high performance computing" lecture
 YurkovAS: @struct run mcts separated for me and op- collect stat for 8 turns- choose best for me
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://jjj.de/fxt/fxtbook.pdf">https://jjj.de/fxt/fxtbook.pdf</a>if you have a lot of time at hand
 YurkovAS: but with MC: stuck at top70mcts search better in my case
 eulerscheZahl: interesting
 eulerscheZahl: my bot plays an optim game, not a multiplayer
 Scarfield: Why make things difficult, when it is possible to make them crypticand totally illogical, with just a little bit more effort?” xD
 eulerscheZahl: ending quotes but no starting quotes. i'm confused
 eulerscheZahl: those little things (also not closing those brackets) trigger me
 Wontonimo: there are two types of people in the word, those who can  work off of incomplete information
 YurkovAS: first set bit: 63 - __builtin_clzll(v)
 eulerscheZahl: also my fridge is beeping when i leave the door open for too long. so annoying. how can anyone forget closing it?
 Scarfield: 1mm of with my mouse&#160;:(
 Scarfield: must be the cat
 struct: there is also v &amp; (v-1)
 struct: to check if more than 1 bit is set
 Scarfield: lol Wontonimo
 Wontonimo: what does v &amp; -v do&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: get least significant bit
 struct: ~ is a til
 Wontonimo: ah
 eulerscheZahl: like:001100 =&gt; 100
 Wontonimo: oh, that's cool
 eulerscheZahl: no struct, you just introduced the tilde. none before that
 eulerscheZahl: fix your fonts
 eulerscheZahl: we won't have this problem anymore on discord&#160;:(
 struct: oh
 struct: so its v &amp; -v?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 struct: I usually use
 struct: const U128 cell = legal_cells &amp; ~(legal_cells - 1)
 eulerscheZahl: v &amp; (~v+1)if your machine doesn't use 2's complement
 struct: Maybe thats why I got it mixed
 emh:   __m128i zero = _mm_set1_epi8 (0x0 )&#160;;
 emh: does it work?
 emh: hmm maybe it's not signed
 struct: maybe _mm_sign could work?
 44AA44: Миска йогурта с пластиковой ложкой в ней
 struct: English on this chat
 44AA44: oops
 44AA44: sorry
 44AA44: wrong chat
 struct: np
 emh: struct hmm.. got same result with _mm_sign
 Brawler_zx: C++ is impossible is shortest challenges
 Scarfield: #ru
 eulerscheZahl: is the /join command broken?
 struct: it works for me
 Scarfield: forgot xD
 TimothyAlexisVass: :taco: Scarfield
 antiwonto: [auto] Sorry but you can only award tacos once per day
 TimothyAlexisVass: -_-
 Scarfield: aww
 TimothyAlexisVass: Yes Brawler_zx it is very rarely the shortest
 emh: struct ahh both were correct. gives same results as 1 &lt;&lt; __builtin_ctz(v)
 emh: except for 0
 emh: which is undefined for __builtin_ctz
 emh: I think
 FlyingCow: what's bot programming: green circle going to be about?
 Westicles: recycling?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Code Keeper - The Hero ... the mouseovers show OOB,NP, etc.  smh
 eulerscheZahl: that's bot programming FlyingCow<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 SchawnnahJ: hello
 struct: yes emh for 0 its undefined
 5DN1L: po
 5DN1L: sigh
 j4at: From the picture of the event. I guess that the green circle event is about finding a green circle :3 He is checking the laptop for the coordinates but there is obstacles along the way like the river and moutains lol!! I'm proably very wrong. But if i'm not path finding algorithms + {insert very fast language here} is the only way to do this. NN's are not good at path finding depending on the map size. So I probably have no chance to win.
 eulerscheZahl: us mere mortals never have a chance to win, regardless of the game
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Apparently they have been recognized for sustainability, so maybe it's sim village with eco scoring
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or it's a rehash of spider attack, lol
 j4at: eulerscheZahl. True&#160;:'D
 j4at: why do you have to do me like this :sob:
 struct: I will win this contest sorry
 eulerscheZahl: there is no tshirt for you this time
 struct: ill trade the phone for a shirt
 j4at: That's if you consider 2nd position a win. Because i'm definitely top 1.
 eulerscheZahl: as a programming, i start counting at 0
 eulerscheZahl: programmer*
 j4at: lua users are not programmers 
 Insufficient: does anybody know much about this green circle event coming up?
 Insufficient: societe generale put up a 23 second trailer but didnt exactly reveal much
 Revellion: hey guys, im new here, can anyone tell me what rank should i be in bronze to move to next league?
 struct: well we know its a bot programming contest
 struct: Revellion you need to be ranked above the boss
 struct: I think the video tells more than it usually does
 DomiKo: video? where?

 DomiKo: thx
 DomiKo: struct too slow
 emh: struct in case you want some AVX inspiration look at parallel popcount, algorithm "count_bytes" on page 5 of:
 emh: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07612.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07612.pdf</a>
 emh: I think the instructions used in this algorithm is quite versatile, useful for other purposes as well
 emh: actually it's not even AVX, just SSE
 struct: Thanks I think Ive seen this before
 emh: ahh ok
 BJD: taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey BJD, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 11 tacos
 Westicles: something wrong with those videos, the audio is all gibberish
 eulerscheZahl: isn't it fun how they don't even notice they are speaking glibberish?
 SalvG: guys did ever get a wrong result in the test cases, and a correct one in the validators?
 SalvG: did you*
 SalvG: think is a bug
 eulerscheZahl: i even failed a validator in the past. and then edited the contribution so i would pass
 5DN1L: I think you asked a similar question two days ago, SalvG, are you still stuck on the same problem or are you on a different problem now?
 ooliver1: h
 SalvG: different. park pilot, test case 3
 SalvG: got 100% in the validator
 5DN1L: oh well you've got a bug which somehow doesn't affect the results of the validators negatively :shrug:
 SalvG: just wasted some time trying to fix the code, even though was correct. next time i ll just submit as I finish
 Darleanow: Hello 5DN1l&#160;:)
 Darleanow: wassup&#160;?:)
 5DN1L: Hello Darleanow&#160;:)
 Darleanow: I'm learning c++ xD
 Darleanow: found myself struggling on the descent
 5DN1L: oh
 Darleanow: just because i couldn't understand why there was a whil(1)
 Darleanow: which was stupid to me as everyone told me it was bad
 Darleanow: anyways, i did it&#160;!
 5DN1L: good :D
 Darleanow: just a question
 Darleanow: u did all the puzzles in py right&#160;?
 5DN1L: mostly python yeah
 Darleanow: impressive
 Darleanow: :o
 5DN1L: huh? what's so impressive about it?
 Darleanow: some are very hard&#160;!!
 Darleanow: aight gtg brb
 5DN1L: ok bye
 Crosility: 5dN1L, how long have you been on CodingGame?
 5DN1L: More than 3 years
 Crosility: Wow, well, no words. Sorry, was just curious. Very impressive profile. Keep it up boss :D
 5DN1L: thank you
 Ayza: can I possibly get 2% in bot programming just by progressing in spider attack?
 Ayza: 6% right now
 Darleanow: im back there&#160;:)
 matthewma6: lol
 thethiny: According to what I've seen, Ubisoft developers are the most talented
 struct: no Ayza
 struct: its capped at 5k points
 Ayza: I see thank you

 antiwonto: [auto] hey Bribbo dont paste those links here.  Use the channel #clash
 theycallmedavid: How long will be the green circle?
 theycallmedavid: Around 10 days or is this a shorter one?
 theycallmedavid: 11 days I see
 theycallmedavid: It shows quite clearly:sweat_smile:
 jacek:  
 tibithegreat: in the SameGame puzzle, what's the time limit for the first turn? It says 20s, but that seems extremely and unrealistacally  large, and I do get timeout after what seems to be 400 ms
 Westicles: I think that includes compile time?
 tibithegreat: hmmm isn't that weird tho?
 tibithegreat: I mean I've never took compile time into account before&#160;:-??
 Crosility: Wow, found my favorite Visual Studio editor config code. "editor.renderWhitespace": "all",Those little dots are awesome.
 jacek: :tada:
 Westicles: some guy had bunches of c++ templates for the last contest and it took like 2 minutes to compile
 jacek: timeout could happen if your program crashes
 tibithegreat: oh ... you're right, I might be going out of bounds with so much memory
 struct: Isnt it max 10 sec compile time?
 Westicles: maybe it really is 10s compile + 20s first turn
 tibithegreat: yeah it might be. jacek was right, my code was getting timeout because it was going out of bounds, I got it up to 700ms before timeout by increasing some vectors
 tibithegreat: yep, checked it with a while (true) which just checked a timer and it breaks if time elapsed is &gt; 19s
 tibithegreat: and i didn't get timeout, so the limit really is 20s it seems
 struct: which game are you playing?
 struct: same game?
 tibithegreat: yeah
 jacek: or different?
 tibithegreat: :D nope, it's the same 
 struct: Im 1 step closer to finish my NN for hexapawn
 jacek: :tada:
 tibithegreat: how many steps left tho?
 struct: Well the first step was to create the sim
 struct: So its like 5 minutes work
 struct: lol
 jacek: bitboarded?
 struct: yes
 struct: he seems to use 21 inputs for some reason
 struct: why would someone use 3 inputs for the player to move instead of 1 jacek?
 jacek: i dont know
 struct: maybe this is the secret you are missing in bt
 jacek: i either double the weights or invert the board
 struct: I see
 struct: So no player at all on inputs right?
 jacek: no
 jacek: i dont know why 3 inputs particularly. i think this would be the same like 1 input with weights * 3
 struct: Yeah I dont understand whats the difference from 1 to 3 since they all serve the same purpose
 struct: maybe it makes the current player be more relevant? or it doesnt work like that?
 jacek: dunno
 jacek: alphazero used a channel with all 1 or -1 depending on players turn
 struct: What is a channel?
 jacek: in CNN, input image rgb has 3 channels
 jacek: 1 for each color
 thethiny: im in a clash with 3 bots
 thethiny: will I win
 j4at: More generally. Having multiple channels is like having multiple values in each cell instead of 1. Each multiplied by different weights so the dimensions of the filter becames filter_size x filter_size x channels_input_size x channels_output_size
 thethiny: Mathieu Won
 j4at: struct
 struct: j4at thanks
 struct: He does say "Probably one bit would suffice for the network to recognize turns - but we really do not haveto consider input size or performance issues for a game with such low game complexity"
 struct: I guess I should have read it before making questions
 thethiny: how did the bot get 14 characters in bash when I get 60 in python
 struct: what was the puzzle thethiny?
 thethiny: The program:Your program must create the lowest integer from the input with the choice of subtracting each digit from 9 or not.
 thethiny: For example, 17 can become 12 by replacing the digit 7 by 2 (because 9 - 7 = 2).
 struct: 1 sec
 thethiny: alright
 struct: Do you remeber a test case?
 struct: or a phrase from it
 struct: so I can search it
 thethiny: 169 becomes 130
 thethiny: okay so someone in the chat sent me the solution
 thethiny: tr 56789 43210
 thethiny: bruh
 struct: yeah
 struct: it can even be shorter than that
 thethiny: really?
 struct: tr 5-9 43210
 thethiny: anyhow the bot shouldnt participate in this tbh
 thethiny: imo*
 struct: i think it should work
 thethiny: lemme try
 thethiny: yeah
 thethiny: works
 j4at: The bots are not even that strong. If you are using python you should expect that you can't win 100% of the time
 j4at: Also this is 52 characters solution
 j4at: print(*(min(c,9-c)for c in map(int,input())),sep="")
 Jafego: I saw someone did 14
 Jafego: Using bash tho
 j4at: struct solution is 12 chars :3
 struct: I used to clash a lot
 struct: noy anymore
 struct: not*
 struct: I didnt even know bash and knew some solutions by hearth
 bobth: lol I never have even thought of using bash for shortest
 struct: bash, perl and ruby would all beat python most of the time
 bobth: yeah
 bobth: i still use python even though I'm going to lose 
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: Hey, I got a "Clash" i wrote accepted&#160;:)  Does anyone know if/how I can see if it has been played by any coders during a class, and maybe even how they did on it??
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: *Clash (not class)
 struct: There is not really a way
 struct: it only tracks views
 Lisa-Has-Ideas: (okay, thanks)
 bobth: I've gotten bot checked 4 times playing CoC, is this normal
 bobth: 4 times over a few days
 bobth: 3 days actually
 Thorcode: green circle seem fun
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Thorcode, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 8 tacos
 Mehdi_Moulati: gm
 Thorcode: gm

 Tien118: taco
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Tien118, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 8 tacos
 Tien118: yas
 Tien118: take tacos
 antiwonto: [auto] That taco command has moved to the #taco channel
 j4at: :taco: Tien118
 antiwonto: [auto] j4at has awarded Tien118 8 tacos. Tien118 now has 16 taco. j4at now has 9 taco

 eulerscheZahl: EvModder not all games provide parameters in addition to the seed
 VizGhar: hey eulerscheZahl did you managed to run brutaltester somehow?
 eulerscheZahl: didn't try
 VizGhar: hmm ok thanks... I'm unable to run it (neither wonto)
 eulerscheZahl: i know that you have to patch the referee first in order to expose a command line
 VizGhar: I only wanted to print java -jar tester.jar -h
 VizGhar: with no success
 VizGhar: In that case i shouldnt need referee
 EvModder: Is this the correct way to get a spider's position next turn?:constexpr pii get_next_xy(){
 EvModder: wait let me simplify that lol
 EvModder: new_x = symmetric_truncate(old_x + .5)
 EvModder: new_y = symmetric_truncate(old_y + .5)
 EvModder: wait damnit I forgot vx and vy
 EvModder: new_x = symmetric_truncate(old_x + vx + .5) **** there we go
 BenjaminUrquhart: I just add vx and vy lol
 PatrickMcGinnisII: .5?
 EvModder: I was doing that too but it seems to be incorrect
 EvModder: apparently x = x + vx is wrong lol
 BenjaminUrquhart: works well enough for me
 JulienKerlero: since vx and vy are integer I don't get why you would truncate them&#160;?
 EvModder: because in the underlying game engine they are doubles, not int
 JulienKerlero: oh I see
 EvModder: for example, it might tell you vx is 400 but next turn you see the entity has only moved 399 in that direction
 JulienKerlero: then how do you know what are the real vx and vy&#160;?
 EvModder: we don't, but it always either truncates or "rounds up" (i.e., .1 becomes 1)
 EvModder: so I just picked .5 arbitrarily
 EvModder: saying 0.0001 is equally valid and will give the same output
 JulienKerlero: isnt is written in the rules how it is truncated?
 EvModder: yeah, i just wanted someone to check my math lol
 EvModder: I'm basing off the source code of the engine here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/c481d8fcaafbba9e4dbf767ee4d0b4040d088938/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L164">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022/blob/c481d8fcaafbba9e4dbf767ee4d0b4040d088938/src/main/java/com/codingame/game/Vector.java#L164</a>
 JulienKerlero: dude its 7am where i am and I havent sleep
 EvModder: f
 Fallback: Has anybody seen strange-ness around the velocity of mind controlled mobs? The flags from GC will say that they are threatening a base when the velocity isn't because it is from before the mind control.
 EvModder: i think even if u mind-control a monster to be outside ur base it won't lose it's target
 EvModder: only wind has that feature
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it divides by length so i see where it can lose digits, but significnt to 1/2200
 PatrickMcGinnisII: .0045
 EvModder: this is what annoys me with challenges like this... (floating point precision)
 Ketroc: It takes 2 frames from the CONTROL cast before the velocity/trajectory is updated.
 cegprakash: Are the servers back to normal?
 BenjaminUrquhart: mostly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: there's more serious errors.  a mob can have a threat of 1 and have a travel trajectory where it doesn't get caught by base and goes off the board
 Ketroc: ya, I think they were always normal... it's just when they opened silver league they had to run games for everyone at once, so it took hours.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i shielded several and lost mana for nothing, i attacked/wind several and lost turns.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: like 9 hours
 Ketroc: i've never noticed that.  maybe you just winded it to where it then missed the base
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no i wind to keep it from getting caught, when it wouldn't have
 PatrickMcGinnisII: althought threat said it would
 Ketroc: well, I've never engaged a spider with threat 1 that ended up missing the zone.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: very small&#160;%, but it happens
 PatrickMcGinnisII: they don't snap to lineborder
 EvModder: floating point nonsense.. i miss pacman game lol
 Ketroc: pretty sure there is only integers.  when I truncate my calculations to ints, it matches perfectly to the in-game trajectories
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i was trying to CONTROL mobs to opposite enemy base corners to screw up defenders, but the math never worked right
 burnpanck: There are all sorts of strange things in this game implementation; calculations are done with floats, but truncated to ints in an almost-but-not-quite symmetrical fashion at random places
 Ketroc: ya, that is true.  if you send em to the exact corner, they just walk off the screen (but their threatFor won't be 1)
 burnpanck: for example the speed of a monster is truncated to integer almost all times, except when a monster is pushed outside the base radius - then it receives a random, floating point speed. the positions are then truncated at each move step.
 Ketroc: I just aim them in an extra 100 coords from the corner.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: pulling my defenders is just ugh  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624191897">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624191897</a>
 struct: burnpanck I agree with you
 struct: its a mess
 jacek: they should have used BigDecimal :v
 Aramang: do you gain wild mana if you hit spiders in the enemy base?
 VizGhar: hmm good question
 VizGhar: wild mana: mana gained outside the radius of your base.
 dbdr: defend the enemy base, win on wild mana :D
 VizGhar: yeah, and with your defenders only redirect spiders to opp base
 struct: I would say you do
 Kururugi: is there any way to calculate the wild mana i have generated?
 Kururugi: within game
 dbdr: you can estimate it
 DaNinja: If your heroâ€™s new position is outside base and within 800 from the monsters old position, then damage is dealt and you get wild mana
 Uljahn: is wild mana generated by damaging monsters or just by staying outside the base?
 struct: damaged monsters by heroes that are outside your base
 struct: So if a monster is inside but your hero is outside you get wild mana
 YiCao: Please,  When to open Gold and Legend?
 therealbeef: why does that matter?
 VizGhar: therealbeef people sometimes ask questions just to get answers&#160;;)
 YiCao: Yes :sweat_smile:
 therealbeef: but 100s of people asking the same not-very-relevant question all day gets a bit old
 VizGhar: that's true
 Uljahn: new league every two days
 YiCao: Thanks UIJahn
 eulerscheZahl: i'm surprised that they opened a league on Sunday
 VizGhar: so they don't have to deal with everybody complaining how slow the promotion is :P
 eulerscheZahl: maybe because it was an old game and they already had a boss. like for the planet game where they had leagues up to gold on beginning
 eulerscheZahl: so not a player's bot this time i assume
 VizGhar: hmm maybe... and what was format of this game before? Probably not full blown online contest
 eulerscheZahl: no, a shorter duration. 1.5 days for the one we found
 eulerscheZahl: maybe it was used on other occasions with different timeframes, no idea
 struct: I still think the boss should have been stronger
 struct: The boss seems stronger than my bot
 struct: and mine still passed
 VizGhar: for sure... this one is joke
 eulerscheZahl: i promoted without spoells
 therealbeef: maybe the samsung contest was a bit longer, who knows
 struct: was samsung contest confirmed?
 Kururugi: For this contest, is there any genetic algo i could use?Examples would be good too. Like using the referee brutaltester to improve my ga
 eulerscheZahl: you have to code your own, no framework provided
 therealbeef: no, but i see no other explanation for a guy submitting a bot within 2 after contest launch that then dominates field for 4 days
 therealbeef: *2 hours
 VizGhar: aha... so thats why 2 samsung guys are at top
 Kururugi: i see
 therealbeef: either that or the guy is a god
 struct: not 2 VizGhar
 Kururugi: but is there any example of a ga learning against itself and improving?
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/sQ1ALu4.png">https://i.imgur.com/sQ1ALu4.png</a>
 jrke: i think that default AI is stronger than boss3
 VizGhar: hehe... They wont win... you can see they are only using heuristics
 struct: I cant talk much though I also had an advantage the previous contest
 Kururugi: heurestics are only as strong as its robustness
 Kururugi: the more it can deal with complex situation, the better
 derjack: best heuristic is: doWinningMoves()
 derjack: :upside_down:
 struct: Is that what you use on most board games?
 derjack: this is jacekmax. instawin
 derjack: if both use jacekmax, servers crash
 struct: im just waiting for last day submit
 struct: maybe there is a bug
 derjack: there are many bugs in this game. the point is to kill them
 struct: I meant feature sorry
 aCat: so far no sim batter then heuristics confirmed so....
 Westicles: euler got silver with no wind?
 struct: I havent submited yet aCat
 aCat: you are my hope struct&#160;:*
 struct: Guess i'll have to code then
 aCat: good motivation&#160;;]
 struct: I guess it can also be last contest and my last chance to get a shirt
 Kururugi: yeah that is..
 dbdr: any official announcement about that?
 struct: no
 aCat: so why people think that way?
 aCat: because CG is slacking off and givin as old games?
 struct: Math
 struct: 2020 3 contests
 struct: 2021 2 contests
 struct: 2022 1 contest
 aCat: yyy
 derjack: 2024 -1 contest
 aCat: 2022 you have first half
 EvModder: wait what? no future shirts after this contest?
 dbdr: what about fall 2022?
 derjack: they ran out of stock
 aCat: in 2021 first half you had 1 contest also
 EvModder: are there shirts for this contest at least??
 struct: EvModder I just dont know if there will be more contests, but I know the same as you
 EvModder: if no shirts, why am i even competing lol
 struct: It was just a way to motivate myself, there will probably more contests
 EvModder: so are there shirts for this contest, or not?
 struct: There are 
 struct: top 20
 EvModder: alright
 Westicles: the issue is they aren't going to have employees around capable of making one of these.  almost nobody is working on CG anymore
 dbdr: Win a CodinGame T-shirtThe 3 winners will receive a personalized canvas of the event artwork!Also 20 T-shirts will be awarded to the 20 top players in the Leaderboard!
 SirLoxley: How can I play against a friend who's not in the top 1000?
 SirLoxley: I cannot find his bot
 dbdr: community has done official contests in the past
 struct: you cant
 aCat: yep
 aCat: planty of community people willing to do games
 aCat: and skilled enough in the cg sdk
 eulerscheZahl: technically you had the tshirt chance twice in the last year, escape also gave some
 struct: I was porting backgammon before contest but didnt have enough time to finish it yet
 struct: its not about the shirt
 struct: an escape shirt wont have the same meaning
 eulerscheZahl: it's about winning it by achieving something, i know
 eulerscheZahl: i'm competitive enough to have the same way of thinking
 dbdr: top 20 escape is much harder (for me&#160;;) )
 eulerscheZahl: *top5 teams
 eulerscheZahl: you could have cheated: play once, reveal all hints to speedrun with high penalty. then do it again with other account as you know the answers
 eulerscheZahl: but as said: not the same feeling of achievement
 dbdr: didn't they count time from start of event for main lb?
 dbdr: I know there was one for your own time as well, but that's cheatable indeed
 eulerscheZahl: if you are fast enough, you can do 2 runs before others finish the first
 dbdr: then you win without cheating :D
 eulerscheZahl: i feel like sometimes i need to CONTROL spells to redirect. is that just me?
 eulerscheZahl: it's cheating as you still reveal all hints without getting penalty for it
 struct: I just use wind and hope rng redirects it
 eulerscheZahl: *two control
 dbdr: ah yeah, forgot about hints, sorry
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl isn't it just the 1 turn delay?
 struct: one weird beahviour i found with control spell is that vx and vy dont get updated next turn but threathFor does
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/FMKEEQx.png">https://i.imgur.com/FMKEEQx.png</a>
 dbf: eulerscheZahl , congrats with codejam round results, how is your sim going?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: thanks, didn't expect to do that well on codejam. and i gave up on sim
 struct: euler vx and vy dont get updated
 eulerscheZahl: thanks struct. sounds like a bug to me
 eulerscheZahl: is it reported?
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl yes, control applies one turn later. you don't need to do it twice, just wait
 struct: I reported it on the forum
 struct: No answer yet
 aCat: its not a bu i suppose
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/54">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/spring-challenge-2022-bugs-questions/195480/54</a>
 struct: maybe add a reply with that image
 eulerscheZahl: what if not a bug? just a major WTF?
 aCat: it is so that you do not know the intention of control
 struct: But I know
 struct: because threath is updated
 dbdr: it's not applied yet. so not a bug?
 aCat: lol
 Westicles: was that guy right earlier that you can figure out the rng?
 struct: Its not applied but threathfor gets updated dbdr
 struct: Check on euler image
 eulerscheZahl: let me extend the screenshot range
 aCat: threats are changed&#160;; -)
 struct: it shows it
 aCat: ok, that is a bug xd
 dbdr: &gt; Override the target's next action
 dbdr: just ignore threat, you should compute that yourself anyways&#160;;)
 struct: But in this case it helps
 struct: because you have wrong vx and vy
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/tx5UeR3.png">https://i.imgur.com/tx5UeR3.png</a>
 struct: so threathfor helps if it was controlled by opponent
 dbdr: it's not wrong, the control has not been applied yet
 dbdr: it's the rules
 eulerscheZahl: if i add the speed to the location, i certainly don't get the new location
 dbdr: yes, because your control applies after that, not before
 struct: But if it applies after why threathfor get updated?
 struct: This is the part I dont get
 eulerscheZahl: i already did a control in the turn before
 dbdr: but control is delayed as per the rules
 eulerscheZahl: for me it's a bug. suppose my opponent does a CONTROL: i won't even know
 dbdr: struct yeah, threat is not consistent
 struct: euler you have is_controlled i guess
 dbdr: yes, not knowing what the opp does is intended. you know they did control, just not where
 dbdr: just more fog&#160;;)
 struct: You know if he redirected it to your base though
 kovi: yeah, at least you can track your own control
 eulerscheZahl: i'm fine with the spider keeping the direction. but in the following turn the speed should be undated to the following direction
 dbdr: in turn t + 2 it is, no?
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, are you going to use heuristics and geometry instead of sim?
 eulerscheZahl: i count this as a bug and wait for a CG resolution instead of coding on my own to account for it
 EvModder: what is the bug?
 struct: Which part is the bug euler?
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know yet dbf
 struct: vx and vy not getting updated?
 struct: or threatfor getting updaed?
 eulerscheZahl: bug = speed not updated in inputs
 EvModder: spiders revert back to the direction they were originally going after control spell ends?
 eulerscheZahl: that's my monte carlo at work<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623689521">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/623689521</a>
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, it's the referee applying what the statement says. won't be changed
 VizGhar: EvModder they shouldnt
 eulerscheZahl: but getting spells in there will be a pain
 dbdr: imo
 Salticid: Adding vx and vy to the position doesn't produce the next position (if I understand correctly)
 EvModder: VisGhar are you sure?
 EvModder: when I read the rules, it sounds like they should
 Tiramon: according to text and referee i say they should ...
 struct: I agree with Tiramon
 struct: It will save me work
 Tiramon:&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: does Tiramon agree with me? i'm getting more and more confused
 EvModder: i agree as well, it seems to be what the rules say
 dbdr: :D
 Tiramon: afaik only wind changes vx/y in a random way
 aCat: euler depth 1 + state eval?
 EvModder: yes
 eulerscheZahl: my monte carlo from the replay above is depth 15
 struct: no beam?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 aCat: you do so deep search?
 aCat: omg
 eulerscheZahl: back to coding now, i'll close the chat
 aCat: good luck
 Tiramon: hm opening silver date was a timestamp and they forgot to add gold opening
 dbdr: Tiramon statement does not really say if direction change is permanent
 dbdr: but it is, right?
 dbdr: and it says spiders go in a straight line
 Tiramon: and in that way it should not in wind it is said that direction gets random
 dbdr: so if it changes one turn, then they continue on that new line
 Tiramon: to be precise text says Override the target's next action with a step towards the given coordinates.
 Tiramon: so it only affects the next step
 dbdr: well, it should be clarified for sure
 Tiramon: sure
 dbdr: after the next step, control does not apply, but spiders go straight, so they continue&#160;:)
 Tiramon: but we can keep euler from coding with discussing that with him&#160;;)
 dbdr: :P
 dbdr: he closed I think
 aCat: we can ping&#160;:&gt;?
 struct: we should let him code
 struct: I want to beat him on a fair fight
 Tiramon: omg battles are pretty slow again ...
 eulerscheZahl: slow submit made me reopen the chat
 aCat: :joy_cat:
 Q12: Do you guys use sim? I don't know if to try to implement it or it is just a waste of time
 Tiramon: didn't sim anything yet
 struct: I cant code without sim
 Q12: That what I thought struct, but it seems hard this time and maybe not worthwhile
 struct: the referee is public
 struct: just dont copy how they check if a spider is a threat
 struct:&#160;:)
 Tiramon: lol i got a fight with aggresive opp spells and my defense can handle it but he can't handle the incoming with his remaining 2 heroes ... thats a nice win
 Q12: it doesn't feel right for me to just use complicated if else and geometry and heuristic  
 Q12: thanks struct I will check it out
 VizGhar: I'm using heuristic... Dont have time for sim&#160;:) Hope I can get to top gold
 struct: I need to use sim because I dont know math
 Q12: :smile:
 Q12: Yeah, It took me a while to check if spider is going to damage my base but I did it finally
 VizGhar: I've just geometrized "closest intersection" so that I'm not wasting time following unreachable creep/finding optimal path to it. Also I'm able to attack multiple creeps at once... but no search
 VizGhar: removed half my code... heuristic is hell
 Q12: yeah, understood
 VizGhar: dropped 400 places, but I think It was worth it
 VizGhar: :P
 cegprakash: d0m 2 attacker  meta by d0m is OP :D
 cegprakash: he is in top 300 with 2 attacker meta lol
 Q12: I think I will keep with my code for a little while but in the end I would switch to sim
 Aramang: i reckon my 3 defenders would do better vs 2 attacker than 1
 Aramang: they tend to waste a lot of mana shielding themselves against 1 dude
 cegprakash: not really Aramang
 cegprakash: d0m wrecks u <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624223877">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624223877</a>
 Aramang: so do 700 other bots lol
 cegprakash: stop defending and go for the kill Aramang
 cegprakash: attacking is the best defense 
 Aramang: yeah I'm adding some attacking stuff, but its more about making them waste time in base not gaining wild mana than dealing damage
 _NikJ: personally, I can't make my bot right when attacking, my 3 defender bot was way higher inthe ranking than my 2+1 combo&#160;:(
 _NikJ: Not sure what I'm doing wrong
 EvModder: If I submit my current IDE code I'd probably drop 1000 places
 yhyoxx: same
 EvModder: but I still believe it is better, inherently :P
 struct: I wouldnt because im at the bottom already
 Tiramon: cegprakash but attacking is only useful if you got a working defense&#160;;)
 _NikJ: same EvModder
 _NikJ: true, it could be that my 3 man defense is much much stronger than 2 man defense, that's why it's performing worse Tiramon
 Tiramon: and even 2 heroes have to do the right stuff and can be effective that way
 struct: Best way is 3 attackers
 Q12: short games
 cegprakash: sumbits too slow again&#160;:(
 cegprakash: struct u mean 3 allrounders? :P
 Tiramon: hm still loosing to many games by wild mana&#160;:(
 struct: I have no idea about strategies in this game cegprakash
 struct: Anyways it's my turn now to close the chat
 struct: Ping me if mod action is needed
 derjack: balls
 MACKEYTH: Ah, finally got that timeout bug locked down
 derjack: hm?
 MACKEYTH: My challenge bot kept timing out mysteriously
 Murat_Eroglu: Battles are really slow
 MACKEYTH: Yeah they are
 DollarAkshay: Getting network error 
 DollarAkshay: Anyone else&#160;?
 aatj: It would be interesting to know the range of memory usage and program complexity (calculations per round?) for everyone in the silver round.
 ProS: same, 504
 Digon: +1
 eulerscheZahl: 504 all the time
 ProS: when trying to open <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a>
 Rhadamanthus: I'm getting 504 too
 ProS: Code wasn't saved(
 eulerscheZahl: that's why you use an offline IDE and copy-paste it
 ProS: That's strong argument you said
 Rhadamanthus: That's exactly what I did :D 
 aCat: nie push euler&#160;;-)
 aCat: *nice
 eulerscheZahl: and with a bit of extra setup you can code in multiple files and bundle it
 aCat: anly way to do it&#160;;]
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. still very basic heuristics actually. not sure if others are bad or i'm lucky so far
 aCat: without marger its a pain
 eulerscheZahl: anly?
 eulerscheZahl: and 2 losses in a row, just that you mentioned it
 eulerscheZahl: 1h to reach 25% progress :zzz:
 pychainman: good morning 
 kaitai: how often do promotions happen?
 eulerscheZahl: every minute or so
 kingSelom: I cant get it to work on my side
 kingSelom: since yesterday
 kingSelom: and there are my errors in the console too
 kaitai: I mean I started yesterday and didnt get promotion in couple of hours after beating boss 
 kaitai: now Im waiting for promotion out of the woods :wink:
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl your attacker feels lonely, nothing to do <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624241074">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624241074</a>
 eulerscheZahl: that's less than 30 lines of logic for the attacker. of course it's stupid
 Nerchio: ye just find it funny when there's a guy in my base without nothing to do whole game, happens quite often
 jrke: anybody in top 10 having sim?
 Nerchio: but that's kinda the game you slip up once and you lose
 eulerscheZahl: i don't really like the game. my goal is to reach legend and call it a day. and that will already require more effort than i want to take on this
 eulerscheZahl: just out of tradition of reaching legend
 Salticid: Game frequency seems to have picked up a bit
 kingSelom: Guys the player is not working for me, I cant see what's going on, it's gray
 kingSelom: anyone having the same?
 Salticid: That happened to me yesterday, I had to close the "last battles" slider and open it again, then it worked
 kingSelom: ok i just changed my browser, now using firefox
 kingSelom: it's working for now
 burnpanck: eulerscheZahl same here except for the "tradition of reaching legend" part&#160;:-)
 kaitai: how do you get text above heroes?
 _NikJ: MOVE X Y YOURTEXT
 _NikJ: basically just append whatever you want to the existing command
 kaitai: tysm
 _NikJ: Silly me, it seems as though always send the nearest hero to the monster is not a very good strat
 Murat_Eroglu: eulerscheZahl, do you think that some if else algorithm will be enough to reach Legend league?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Alurian: yes
 eulerscheZahl: for other games like the previous contest: no waybut this one is different
 Tiramon: does wild mean outside of 6k or 5k from base?
 Rhadamanthus: yes
 _NikJ: I'd say 5k, 6k is only mentioned when it comes to fog
 Rhadamanthus: outside 5k
 dbdr: the question is whether a pure search can reach legend&#160;;)
 blasterpoard: 5k, and wild mana will be irrelevant, don't worry about it
 kaitai: my heroes are obsessed their initial targets disregarding anything else :innocent:
 dbdr: blasterpoard, do you think attack is OK?
 dbdr: OP, I mean&#160;:)
 kaitai: also it's my first challenge here and I'll aim for legend
 blasterpoard: dbdr <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624251262">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624251262</a> judge it yourself
 blasterpoard: I'm murdering *everyone* in &lt;80 turns at the moment
 kaitai: lol :joy:
 blasterpoard: ille dan sometimes lasts a bit longer though
 dbdr: nice blasterpoard
 Fox787: hmm, i need to learn this technique, looks like fun
 _NikJ: THAT WIND COMBO WAS INSANE
 Murat_Eroglu: Nice combo
 Tiramon: blasterpoard not with your current arena ... i didn't loose a life
 Tiramon: that wind attack ist still ide?
 desoindx: Hello&#160;! I have something i don't understand on this game: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624213755">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624213755</a>On the turn 135, none of my hero attack the monster 90 even if he is in range&#160;:/ 
 dbdr: desoindx the attack is counted before the spiders move, did you account for that?
 blasterpoard: ofc im hiding it Tiramon, I would gain no information by submitting
 therealbeef: blasterpoard will submit in 6 days and 22 hours...
 Fox787: And then won't have long enough for placement to function
 therealbeef: no, the game waits for everyone to finish their matches
 therealbeef: he can even submit in bronze
 struct: Distance: 993.98692144313desoindx
 aCat: blasterpoard heur or sim?
 _NikJ: feels illegal that you can 'double wind'
 jrke: _NikJ whats your opinion on triple wind then?:stuck_out_tongue:
 blasterpoard: aCat sim, up to depth 6 in that replay... kinda
 aCat:&#160;:*
 aCat: sims are not hopeless ok, nice to know
 kovi: but no opponent prediction i guess
 _NikJ: rip jrke
 aCat: but I'm kining a heuristic try now&#160;;]
 _NikJ: no better way to put it, if someone shoots a triple wind rocket towards my base, I'd just surrender :D
 aCat: *koding
 aCat: lol
 eulerscheZahl: coding
 therealbeef: double wind, double inpulse, double distance; seems reasonable
 _NikJ: seems legit
 struct: just wait until you find double hulk
 _NikJ: next up: casting control on all 3 enemy heroes automatically makes them succumb to you and surrender
 jrke: _NikJ in that case your heros also won't do anything else except spells so that can be dangerous though
 jrke: or you can cast spell in a way that opponent heors protects your base
 dbdr: pretty fun idea jrke :D
 Fox787: I have seen a few get attacking hero behind the enemy heroes and just wind spam them out
 jrke: :sweat_smile:
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624272938">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624272938</a> illeda.n is definitely the most annoying defensive bot right now
 _NikJ: I've seen one where someone put 1 hero in base and just spam wind, 1 in middle to farm and wind spiders towards the 3rd, while the 3rd was spamming wind into enemy base
 Rhadamanthus: arrrg I'm hovering around 30 XD... so close!
 kaitai: if you have 3 heroes stacking wind you can push spiders to enemy base without them seeing it :grin:
 Rhadamanthus: Yeah I saw that once and it is scary lol
 Nerchio: blasterpoard show me our game, I will probably die fast but I want to see
 blasterpoard: Nerchio <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624283053">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624283053</a> oof, your bot is even better at defense
 struct: Cant beat a starcraft player
 _NikJ: Why do I feel like stacking wind shouldn't be possible?
 _NikJ: Seems kinda meh to be able to pull monster from the center, then double wind straight into base without any chance of enemy reacting
 Nerchio: blasterpoard I mostly tuned it against 1 attacker, not many people use 2
 Nerchio: that's why your strat works so well atm
 _NikJ: I mean, obviously, I would've done it too if I figured it out before, but seems it shouldn't be possible
 struct: you can even cast 3
 struct: Maybe with 6 you can make it across the map
 struct: let me try :p
 IvesL: this can be solved by placing shields on monsters
 IvesL: but only if you are willing
 IvesL: not many people do that
 _NikJ: Yes, but you're shielding monsters which attack you
 _NikJ: either way you're screwed
 Q12: you can attack him before he attacks you
 Q12: he only have one defender
 Q12: *has
 _NikJ: You could also attack with 3 instantly and hope for the best, but just because you beat some people, doesn't mean overall you wonj't be losing a lot :D
 IvesL: that means you need better vision control
 IvesL: you could have reacted when someone is near your base
 IvesL: control him, search near him whatever
 _NikJ: I do agree with you, I still however believe that stacking wind shouldn't be possible
 IvesL: i had thoughts like yours when i saw it first few days back
 jrke: i have an idea that can be good not sure maybe
 IvesL: but to do so, you risk your defense, that means the opponent could also take advantage of that

 struct: someone had to test it :p
 _NikJ: LMAO
 _NikJ: that was funny af
 _NikJ: I'm bookmarking that replay
 dbdr: well, 2200 * 6
 IvesL: makes sense, 6*2200=13200; diagonal distance 19794
 _NikJ: now it's time to put 3 of them 2/3rds of the way to enemy base and spam wind on all 3, wonder how that bot would do :D
 struct: well you can be in fog and use 3 winds
 IvesL: @_NikJ you mean statiolake
 struct: and it will reach the base

 _NikJ: lmao IvesL
 _NikJ: what rank is it atm?
 IvesL: silver 1900 sth
 _NikJ: huh, thought it would do better
 IvesL: idk if he changes but i doubt
 _NikJ: maybe if he started sooner, he started kinda late
 struct: its too risky
 ItsNotABug: stacking wind is so busted
 Nerchio: :wave: ItsNotABug
 ItsNotABug: Yo
 SirLoxley: "Directory src/main/resources/view/assets not found." ... I don't have a java IDE, but trying to run the referee with mvn ... how to fix that
 ItsNotABug: Ranking has finished, i'm above boss... but no timer to move up?
 Ekaon: Someone knows if we can shield continuously&#160;? Like if (entity.shield_life &lt;= 1)
 IvesL: no
 IvesL: only == 0
 aCat: one turn without shiled is sure
 Ekaon: So it let the opponent use this turn against us
 IvesL: SHIELD also protects entities from receiving a new SHIELD.
 Ekaon: Yes, but I was wondering if the spell would apply after the end of the shield, and before opponent actions
 Ekaon: But you wall seems to say this isnt possible
 Ekaon: Thanks for the answer&#160;!
 burnpanck: Coding heuristic bots is so frustrating! My python 3 bot from the first day of the contest still performs better than any of my C++ bots - even an "exact" reimplementation of the python bot in C++. Heuristics are so fragile!
 aatj: You an see the Action order for one term in the problem statement. 3 is application of shield spells, 8 is decrement of shield countdowns.
 ItsNotABug: Up into silver is good enough for me tonight. Be back when gold is open :peace:
 dinggg: Do you know when Gold opens?
 Ekaon: What is heuristic bot&#160;?
 aatj: Tomorrow evening, ~30 hours, I understand.
 HerkusP: it's faker
 HerkusP: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 HerkusP: :flushed:

 Vyerz: baikit
 HerkusP: sorry men
 Vyerz: juokauju
 Uljahn: english here, guys
 Vyerz:  ;)
 Vyerz: ok man
 HerkusP: i am sorry
 Ekaon: How can we name our heroes&#160;?
 Ekaon:   I the game view I see some bot name their heroes with their behaviour
 aCat: add text after command
 aCat: MOVE 44 56 here i go
 Ekaon: Thank you&#160;!
 Audrone: hello
 aCat:&#160;:-)
 pychainman: what is the mana that is read from input. It doesn't seem to be the current amount of available mana. 
 Uljahn: eh?
 Q12: maybe your confusing with the opponent mana
 pychainman: oh
 Q12: the loop in the beginning gives your mana and health and also the opponent mana and health
 aatj: Wild mana, I understand, is a measure of the total number of strikes performed over the game - sum of damage. It's not stored for you, and there is no way, I understand, to calculate the opponent's wild mana.
 pychainman: wild mana is from damage outside the radius of your base
 Alurian: yes, but it's all strikes outside your base
 aatj: Right, thanks
 Djellowman: you could keep track only of the opponents wild mana if you have permanent vision of their heroes
 pychainman: boss 3 has not provided 3 lines in time lol, wth
 pychainman: The boss bot TLE on me hmm
 SirLoxley: Sorry for the spam, is there really no one able to run the local referee outside of an IDE?
 _NikJ: I switched from 3 def bot to 2 def 1 attacker bot and dropped from 200th in silver to like 1500th. Would anyone care to take a look and see if I'm doing something blatantly wrong?
 AshamanCooper: What is wrong with this? if (light_x - initial_tx &lt; 0 ) and (light_y - initial_ty = 0):
 blasterpoard: controlling spiders already in base range doesn't do anything; you're just wasting a lot of mana with your attacker and not achieving anything
 Uljahn: AshamanCooper: use == to compare
 AshamanCooper: Uljahn: awesome, thank you&#160;:)
 egor1: lol

 TobiasA: I could see the fear:joy:
 TobiasA: *winding
 DaNinja: SirLoxley try this from a previous challenge <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/springchallenge-2021-referee-graphics/190947">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/springchallenge-2021-referee-graphics/190947</a>
 DaNinja: try copying view/assets to view/assets/assets
 Gordonihno: when is the best to use wind on spider attacking your base? i always spam too much or too late
 EvModder: if u know u can't kill it in time (turns until attack &lt; turns it will take to kill)
 EvModder: however, it gets trickier if there is an enemy around
 Aramang: if wild mana is a win condition for you its generally worth winding them entirely out of the base area
 EvModder: i guess it depends how much health they have currently
 EvModder: but in general yes
 Aramang: yeah it would, mostly it keeps your heroes from getting stuck inside though
 EvModder: the other benefit to winding them outside is they might randomly target the enemy
 Gordonihno: hm i tryed to push them away to farm wild mana, but when enemy attacks me i lose because instead of killing, i try to wind them away
 SirLoxley: thanks!
 EvModder: what happens if a monster is 1 or 2 health and both players have a hero in range of it?
 EvModder: who gets the mana? or do both get mana?
 Ekaon: Both gets it
 EvModder: ok that's good
 Aramang: i think if you have 3 heroes in range you get mana 3 times too
 Djellowman: what do people mean when they say heuristic bots?
 EvModder: ^ i've been wondering the same
 Djellowman: it's not like you can do a minimax search or something
 EvModder: i think they mean something like machine-learning-based or hand-tuned
 Djellowman: basically everyone's bot uses heuristics... just not necessarily static game state evaluations
 Aramang: it means they mean not sim/ML really
 Aramang: basically better logic executed less
 EvModder: ah figured
 Djellowman: is anyone using ML for this hackathon then?
 EvModder: (I'm actually using a bit of a min-max, but it makes a few assumptions currently that aren't 100% true)
 Djellowman: how can you locally train the game if you don't have local access to all other peoples
 Djellowman: bots
 EvModder: can train against yourself
 Djellowman: how do you do minimax if you can't look steps ahead?
 Aramang: in theory if you beat a bot you beat everyone below them too
 EvModder: Djellowman I assume that the only "possible" moves are the only "logical" moves, i.e., moving towards targets or casting spells on targets
 Djellowman: i think if you'd so something like a genetic algorithm, you won't stumble upon the handmade strats that people made, and will have weaknesses because your model hasn't seen those bots befoer when battling in arena
 EvModder: which limits the # of moves but is subtly incorrect
 Djellowman: but that's a huge branching factor if you take everything into account... plus you can only see part of the entities
 EvModder: Yeah, I think the trick is a combination of ML and hand-made strats personally
 EvModder: and yes, the branching is crazy... that's why I've been trying for 3 days straight to crack the random game seed so I know the vx,vy of all entities as soon as they spawn&#160;:)
 Djellowman: does your minimax algo look ahead a few steps with all possible actions?
 EvModder: only about 3 steps lmao
 Djellowman: sounds about right tbh
 EvModder: but hopefully that will improve if I can reliable get the seed within 15 turns
 Djellowman: i guess you limit movement directions to cardinal 4 directions, or 8
 EvModder: I limit directions based on possible targets
 EvModder: so if you can see 4 entities, minmax assumes heros will only move towards those 4 or towards base
 EvModder: so far it's not been working well for me though
 Aramang: is it move to intercept the target or move to target?
 EvModder: to intercept
 EvModder: it takes X turns to reach, move towards where it will be in X turns
 EvModder: i could add the other possibility as a branch, but it would only help me against weaker bots
 Aramang: yeah that would be silly
 EvModder: handling spells is really tricky because I need to keep double-checking rules for event order
 Gordonihno: can anyone look at my "monster danger level" function and tell me whats wrong
 eulerscheZahl: don't share larger segments of code please, still a contest
 peerdb: If I cast SHIELD on a monster, but in the same turn my opponent casts CONTROL on me, will I still shield the monster?
 peerdb: In other words, does CONTROL override only a movement action, or any action
 EvModder: control overrides action next turn, not current&#160;:)
 peerdb: oh okay i missed that, thanks
 EvModder: me too originally 
 Th1nhNg0: How i can run SpringChallenge2022 source code local&#160;?
 EvModder: u will need to make(or copy) a game engine simulator
 Th1nhNg0: I found  the source here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022">https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022</a>
 EvModder: u can try to download, compile, and run it, but honestly it's probably more hassle to get it working than it's worth
 peerdb: so if I check and see that my unit is under control (is_controlled == true), does it matter what I try to do?
 EvModder: i just do "wait" when i see that
 EvModder: because i dont think it matters
 Nerchio: siman sorry :grin:
 EvModder: i do "wait -_-"
 KamiTzayig: i cant see the videos of the battles
 KamiTzayig: only grey area
 Djellowman: EvModder how do you do your heuristic / terminal node evaluations? that seems like a very daunting task for this game... which patch through the tree do you pick / sort moves by?
 jrke: how does wind work? unable to locate in referee:neutral_face:
 EvModder: i have a tuple in this order: base health, mana, vision
 EvModder: or more specifically, the difference between mine &amp; opponents in each one
 Djellowman: with moving to intercept you mean you take the coord distance per step and the vx/xy into account of the target entity?
 EvModder: my_base_health - opp_base_health, my_mana - opp_mana, etc
 therealbeef: jrke it's called push in referee
 EvModder: yeah, i think so
 Djellowman: what's referee
 therealbeef: L285 in Referee.java
 EvModder: he's talking about the game engine source code
 Djellowman: ah yeah makes sense
 Djellowman: 1 more question Ev
 EvModder: ok
 Djellowman: the last thing you sort by in your tuple is vision
 Djellowman: how do you determine vision
 EvModder: circles overlapping = less vision
 Djellowman: do we have access to such variables
 EvModder: there are 4 circles to account for
 EvModder: base, and each of 3 heros
 Djellowman: okay you just calculate circles around base &amp; units i see
 EvModder: yeah, i might drop it from my minmax though because of the excessive sqrt() calls
 Djellowman: would be a good heuristic if you could see 100 steps far ;p
 derjack: sqrt is cheap
 derjack: in hardware
 Djellowman: perhaps maximizing the sum of monster distance to your base ^ -2 would be useful
 EvModder: yeah, that's probably a cheaper calculation too
 Djellowman: where ones very near to your base have a quadratic effect on the heuristic
 Djellowman: it might decide to blow them away lol
 Djellowman: 50ms really isn't much for deeper searches though
 DollarAkshay: is time.time() good enough to measure 100 ms&#160;?
 DollarAkshay: I mean is is good enough to measure times below 100ms on coding game.
 RSBat: just set a little lower threshold (i.e. 95 instead of 100) and it should be ok
 DollarAkshay: I am not using it as a threshold. Just want to know how accurate it is on CodinGame's platform 
 jobvan-d: I guess one could just calculate a^2 + bË†2 = c^2 = distanceË†2, and then just square the distance you want to compare it to, then you don't need a sqrt. Does need a square but that's much much faster
 Alshock: DollarAkshay it is accurate to the ~50Âµs at least, but you will probably need more safety zone depending on your code loop. The timer starts when you read your first input (unless you tried to do too many stuff after your output, in which case this wil lcome first)
 DollarAkshay: Ahh, alright. Thanks @Alshock
 Alshock: Time.time is not recommended for such counts though, I think time.perf_counter() would be a better pick (time.time is absolute) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter">https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter</a>
 Michael_Howard: Is there any way to log more text to the console, so it's not cut off with "..." after a while?
 Alshock: Michael_Howard best way to get better logs is to play against yourself locally IMHO
 eulerscheZahl: you can zip and convert to base64
 Alshock: well yeah you could even base96 your logs but is that really a good advice?
 Inuit: v
 DollarAkshay: hey does any one know the relation between monsterHp and turnNumber&#160;?
 peerdb: am I correct in assuming Gold opens on wednesday? How come this contest it doesnt show in the IDE when the new leagues open
 Jasper_185: I think it was every 10 turns 1 extra hp is added
 DigitalOsmosis: is there a way to challenge a specific player to see how you respond to their code?
 DaNinja: delete Boss and select them if they are in range of your rank
 DollarAkshay: @Jasper_185 Hmm that is pretty accurate thank you
 peerdb: also not that it is anything except cosmetic, but purple spiders seem to start at idx 38 and red ones at 78
 Michael_Howard: peerdb Gold opens Tuesday now I believe (used to be Wednesdays). They took it out because it was showing the date in Unix time, and they'd rather show no date than a correct but buggy looking date.
 peerdb: aight thanks
 Milanovich: DaNinja really nice strategy, can't seem to beat that!
 Milanovich: Got like 20 spiders up in my base while you have 0 all the time ^^
 DaNinja:&#160;:)
 jamil.zaitouny: How long does it take until you get promoted to the next league if you're doing better than the boss?
 therealbeef: it has a countdown at the top of your screen
 jamil.zaitouny: Ah, the percentage battles?
 blasterpoard: you need to finish 100% of your battles first, after that it should take only a couple of minutes
 jamil.zaitouny: I see, thank you!
 jamil.zaitouny: I wonder how far a greedy algorithm will take me
 ddreams: greedy for what?
 VizGhar: ftw
 jamil.zaitouny: The distance of the insects from the base
 ddreams: Low bronze&#160;:) 
 ddreams: that's what mine does
 ddreams: the wood 1 bot also beat wood 2
 jamil.zaitouny: Do older battles reset?
 jamil.zaitouny: Like, if you leave your bot overnight
 ddreams: well, mid bronze now
 ddreams: Kind of
 ddreams: other bots will battle yours
 jamil.zaitouny: It seems like I'm going to fly through wood 1 which is great
 jamil.zaitouny: Without using any spells lmao
 ddreams: same here
 ddreams: was sleeping while it beat wood 1 :D
 jamil321: Is the number next to the battles the win rate?

 geppoz: step 138-140, spider 100
 SirLoxley: I will consider it unreliable hence
 geppoz: winded out, reenter, then reexit
 geppoz: :D
 VizGhar: its maybe that thing that struct was struct by :P
 eulerscheZahl: the wind will randomize the spider direction
 geppoz: uhm, no, only if winded out from base, this seems not the case
 kovi: too bad we cant sim that
 geppoz: in fact, it keeps speed vector
 Drageas: hi
 geppoz: for 2 steps, with y negative
 geppoz: then when enter base, it goes out
 Uljahn: you mean the entity is still in inputs with negative y?
 Uljahn: looks like a visualizer glitch
 geppoz: I still have in IDE, doublechecking
 geppoz: I loose vision after wind, so I cannot dump it

 ClockSort: hey eulerscheZahl, congrats on the very strong finish in Google Code Jam Round 1B yesterday!
 eulerscheZahl: thanks. i definitely didn't expect to do that well
 ClockSort: I think you're going to advance through Round 2 this year
 eulerscheZahl: managed to adapt my bulls and cows strategy from a CG optim to the C task
 eulerscheZahl: saw you always qualified for the next round
 eulerscheZahl: 951st iirc
 eulerscheZahl: also*
 ClockSort: that's right. I didn't solve the second test set on C
 wlesavo: i comletely missed 1st round, wanted to try it, but got caught by cg
 eulerscheZahl: you have a final chance on saturday
 wlesavo: doubt cg will let me :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: it's just 1h if you play it toad-style :P
 wlesavo: this is becoming a bad tradition to play only qualification raund
 wlesavo: my style is to write 15-min and then try to find bug until the end of the round :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: i have another contest lined on in friday+saturday. not sure how much time it will require. sad it collides with CG contest
 eulerscheZahl: lined up on...somehow i can't type
 wlesavo: at least i finally got my first version of search bot
 wlesavo: it is almost as good as 300 lines of python heuristics from friday :smiley:
 aCat:&#160;!
 aCat: great wlesavo
 TobiasA: what kind of search is it wlesavo
 wlesavo: TobiasA a bunch of MC simulations badly tied up together :slight_smile:thanks aCat 
 aCat: but you aim for deep search (MC/GA) or more shallow minmax approach?
 TobiasA: damn then it looks like a search algorithm would be worth it after all
 TobiasA: I was contemplating
 wlesavo: i wanted to do minimax, but at last i think it is gonna be such a pain to get working and restricted myself to MC, at least for the contest
 NewCoder09: It took me a while to do Minimax
 Kasparas: why is total available mana not part of the game input?&#160;:(
 Kasparas: ^ ignore :D
 Kasparas: learnt to read
 NewCoder09: 2 days, 13 hours, 36, and 45 seconds to be exact
 NewCoder09: 36 minutes
 Fubuchi: look like the calculation for "threatFor" considered the position outsite the playable area. I had an case where the contact point with the base circle was x: -398.37; y: 4984.11 but the threatFor value still = 1
 LaurensD: want to fight the bot a friend made, but I cannot seem to find him when searching; is there any requirements for it to be allowed? because in the past it was possible. 
 IvesL: top 1000 in the same league?
 LaurensD: haha same league but we are both &gt; 1800 :P
 LaurensD: had a idea there was a requirement unfortunately
 MichExpatMatt: so maybe a combination of threatFor and nearBase? It would be annoying at the least to have to calculate threatFor oneself when ostensibly it was "given"
 sosi: Why does my rank not move?
 LaurensD: not good enough&#160;:?
 sosi: I played 50+ games but it didn't change. I have won one and been 2nd couple of times 
 sosi: So it should change at least a bit right?
 Fallback: so if a mob is one move away from hitting a base at 2 hp and a hero strikes it. Does it damage the base or die first?
 BJD: monsters die at the end of the round, so i think it damages the base
 BJD: nevermind, it doesnt
 WolfDarrigan: the order for that case is heroes move &gt; heroes do damage &gt; wind spell &gt; monsters move
 cegprakash: when I control a monster will the monster's velocity change immediately when the control is cast or only after the control ends?
 WolfDarrigan: &gt; CONTROL spells are applied to the targets and will only be effective on the next turn, after the next batch of commands.
 Fallback: yes, but he's asking if the target/threat flags and velocity will update on that next turn. I saw outdated flags/vel so I don't trust them when a mob is under control.
 WolfDarrigan: ooh, my mistake
 cegprakash: WolfDarrigan can't get u
 cegprakash: I also got old velocity Fallback
 cegprakash:&#160;:(
 cegprakash: what I did was I used control and used wind immediately on monster's direction and it didn't work as intended
 cegprakash: I mean I used control on turn x and wind on turn x+1 and it didn't work as intended
 Spressed:  else if(initialTx &gt; lightX &amp;&amp; initialTy &gt; lightY &amp;&amp; initialTx &lt;= 41 &amp;&amp; initialTy &lt; 17)
 Spressed: why doesn't the code check the last condition initailTy &lt; 17?
 Spressed: and it runs eitherway, I'm so confused
 Spressed: thanks
 Fallback: add parenthesis around those terms and see if that helps. It may be evaluating (lightX &amp;&amp; initialTy) first
 eulerscheZahl: and don't forget to update thor's position. the game does not do this for you
 Spressed: ohhhhh
 Spressed: makes sense
 Spressed: thanks
 Spressed: appreciated both of you
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624615524">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624615524</a> now this is just jank; accidental cheese prevention
 eulerscheZahl: why did they move out at the bottom around frame 34?
 aCat: but you knew he was there ^^
 eulerscheZahl: you send spiders to the base and they are just like "nah, not now"?
 blasterpoard: exactly
 eulerscheZahl: why?
 eulerscheZahl: bug in the game?
 blasterpoard: yes
 eulerscheZahl: did you report it on the forum already?
 blasterpoard: out-of-bounds spiders behave weirdly
 geppoz: if a 400px step brings them &gt;9000 then they die
 therealbeef: not really a bug; they were out of the arena already, just drawn on the edge
 geppoz: regardless of being entered base
 therealbeef: actually they die at 9800
 therealbeef: but if they hit the base circle while outside 9000, the referee angles them away from the arena, otherwise they'd kill the base from outside the arena
 kovi: from the baseedge they target basewhich means +1 dy. and with symtrunc they go out next
 kovi: +0.001dy sorry
 kovi: (nvm, i saw 8999, they were already out earlier)
 Nerchio: can't push monsters outside of the map right?
 Wontonimo: you can , just not in your base
 Nerchio: :eyes:
 RootYou: Can someone give me a clue about this problem: i would like to give my Hero a "patrol routine" going back and forth between 2 points. But this hero and the gamestate is reset every turn.
 aropan: RootYou: you can store data between turns. ID heroes don't change.
 struct: outside units have a little strage behaviour when you use control
 struct: I think I posted a replay here before
 struct: but cant find it
 RootYou: will try to store heroes position in a Map. thank you aropan
 JRFerguson: hello world, anyone knows if top players in contest simming or using heuristics&#160;?
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624643883">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624643883</a> out-of-bounds scoring...
 VizGhar: JRFerguson both
 JRFerguson: ok, thks viz
 Nerchio: blasterpoard quite a few 'bugs' heh
 karliso: Works as coded.
 struct: :D
 jacek: :upside_down:
 karliso: Nobody said mobs are dead after they leave map. Just that players are not given their coordinates.
 blasterpoard: my math says that using 1 hero with multiple winds is enough to escort an out-of-bounds spider to a base
 karliso: And if you apply wind or control to mob outside of map it will get snapped to game zone. Which makes sense or else it could just appear at opponent base.
 blasterpoard: karliso after using wind, on a spider, it doesn't get snapped to the game zone; only control
 karliso: oh, ok-ey. Only if base wall intersection.
 Quidome: When using control, spider will be moving in current direction only new direction on next turn. Meaning when spider has a current destination in you base-zone it will target your base anyway
 Quidome: Is this the correct way of looking at this?
 avdg: evening
 NewCoder09: hello there
 NewCoder09: :taco: avdg
 avdg: ow?
 NewCoder09: did they move it?
 Astrobytes: disabled for contest.
 NewCoder09: oh 
 NewCoder09: why did it get disabled during the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: because it adds clutter
 NewCoder09: oh ok '
 NewCoder09: Is Automaton2000 disabled too?
 Automaton2000: this website is good for that
 eulerscheZahl: unfortunately not
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624663242">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624663242</a> out-of-bounds scoring with only 1 hero... gotta get a patch for this
 Quidome: that was interesting spider are spawned in a symetrical way&#160;:)
 Quidome: didn't noticed that before...
 NewCoder09: I haven't even started spring challenge 2022
 Jokras: When is Gold League opening?
 dbdr: quidome, seems you didn't read the statement&#160;;)
 dbdr: &gt; Monsters will appear randomly, but symmetrically from the map edges outside of the player's bases. They appear with a random moving direction. 
 jamil321: Can you drop ranks?
 Emmus: NewCoder09 You should! It's super cool
 Illedan: blasterpoard -.-
 Quidome: dbdr thanks for pointing that out :nerd:
 Illedan: blasterpoard, did you report?
 Quidome: me feeling silly&#160;:(
 blasterpoard: I just posted it on the forum Illedan
 Illedan: Thx
 NewCoder09: Emmus i just now did
 George13156: How to code batmanGame
 struct: eulerscheZahl "so yes, thatâ€™s a bug in the input&#160;: vx and vy should be updated too. Weâ€™ll see if we fix it tomorrow or decide to let it as it is."
 struct: and I guess everyone
 struct: This is about controll spell
 NewCoder09: Geurge13156 Batman game?
 struct: it wasnt euler that said that, might be a bit confusing sorry
 struct: I just wanted to ping him
 NewCoder09: struct what's your favorite coding language?
 struct: c++
 Ketroc: name gives that away
 NewCoder09: That's nice I kind of learned C++ but I switched over to Javascript 
 Astrobytes: :rolling_eyes:
 struct: blasterpoard on the replay you shared shouldnt the spider collide?
 struct: and snap
 NewCoder09: Atsrobytes what i used C++ for like 2-3 months and i want to try something new
 matteo1123: I'm like 3 from the worst peson in the entire contest 
 jacek: like cobol
 matteo1123: those two must be morons 
 blasterpoard: struct afaik it snaps if it intersects the boundary of the game zone
 blasterpoard: if it starts outside and ends outside, no snapping happend
 wlesavo: 156 turn bottom of the map<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624658280">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624658280</a>
 eulerscheZahl: thanks struct
 eulerscheZahl: " Weâ€™ll see if we fix it tomorrow or decide to let it as it is"that response though...
 Astrobytes: a touch concerning indeed
 eulerscheZahl: as if someone doesn't care anymore
 Astrobytes: suits the general mood of the contest I guess
 Astrobytes: anyway, I must wash off all this salt
 <b>**eulerscheZahl never puts salt in the water when cooking noodles</b></p><p><img src="/a/60413902297900" /> Astrobytes: Jeez. You heathen.
 eulerscheZahl: we know each other for so long and i still manage to shock you
 Astrobytes: Once in a while! :D
 lolTempest: those are the best types of friends
 Emmus: agree
 avdg: Refactoring my ai under 1500 lines of code again for now
 avdg: brb
 MACKEYTH: I'm wondering if there's a double wind sniper bot revolution waiting to happen
 BJD: i was playing around with wind, and with all 6 players you can get a monster from the middle to a base in 1 turn <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624708490">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624708490</a>
 _NikJ: Yeah makes perfect sense, 3 players can hit 1 football 3 times as far as 1 player
 jacek: 9 women will bear a child in 1 month
 Quidome: wow that was a cool demo, thnxs :D
 blasterpoard: MACKEYTH yes <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/624718127">https://www.codingame.com/replay/624718127</a>
 MACKEYTH: You should let that loose in the wild. Secret's already out...
 blasterpoard: the difference is that you can't test your bots against it yet
 orangesnowfox: Doing the math (@BJD): <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5988c627-9da5-4fd4-ba3a-c3a249206e7b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5988c627-9da5-4fd4-ba3a-c3a249206e7b</a>
 orangesnowfox: ... DANG IT PASTEPIN
 orangesnowfox: The world will never know what the math was
 orangesnowfox: TL;DR you can push about 2/3s across the map
 orangesnowfox: which is at least 1/2, so BJD is right
 jacek: it's at least 10
 MACKEYTH: I like that set and spike move you did, blaster. Slick.
 orangesnowfox: jacek: thanks for the peer review, I'm going to publish this in an accredited journal now /j
 BJD: I wish you could wind your own heroes, you could fly around the map
 orangesnowfox: right?
 MACKEYTH: It's like the crane kick. No can defend.
 orangesnowfox: There have been times where I was like "if I could wind my own hero (by *choice*, obvs I wouldn't always want this) I'd be able to handle a lot of those strats that send mobs into your base while you aren't looking
 orangesnowfox: maybe like make it a different spell, "boost" or smth
 avdg: there was a japanese bot that was specialized in pure catapult mayhems
 orangesnowfox: only targets your own heroes
 avdg: the bot had no defense though
 jacek: offense is best defense
 Nerchio: not in this game
 gearhead: sup
 orangesnowfox: until someone counters your offense with more offense, and then someone counters *that* bot with defense :p
 Nerchio: orangesnowfox there is some rock-paper-scissors strategy wise here
 orangesnowfox: exactly
 avdg: offense in opposite corners
 avdg: would be fun if it was the same bot and struggling at the same time
 nightwalkerinthedark: SIUUUUUUUUUUU
 Nerchio: but in the end the quality bots still dominate :P
 orangesnowfox: oh, yeah. There's RPS, but there's also the frontier of possibility, and you can beat the opposing RPS if your bot is better
 orangesnowfox: 100% agree
 Nerchio: but I am only saying this because  am in top10, if I was top 100 I would call the game pure randomnes
 Nerchio: :wink:
 orangesnowfox: I mean, I see parts where my bot is defo worse than it could be
 eulerscheZahl: i just hate the heuristic nature regardless of my rank
 orangesnowfox: ah, I love heuristics, I've done a billion sims
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, this might actually sneak into top100
 Nerchio: I enjoy heuristic part because I am not willing to code in C++ 
 eulerscheZahl: 96th at 18% great game
 dbdr: :P
 DomiKo: I just hate games with too many cases
 eulerscheZahl: i'd still prefer a slightly more search heavy game over pure heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: i'm with domi. so much nonsense to deal with. players come up with all kind of stuff
 eulerscheZahl: i want the sweet spot between this game and a board game where you just throw another MCTS at it
 dbdr: stop being creative people!&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: silver opened a day earlier than usual. do we know about gold+legend?
 Nerchio: maybe that's why i enjoy this one so much, cause you can do whatever you want
 wlesavo: just ban blasterpoard and  we good :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to have that much freedom
 eulerscheZahl: take me on a leash and only give me a little room to move around within that tiny radius
 Nerchio: maybe we can make that happen
 eulerscheZahl: nah, community contests are dead
 eulerscheZahl: pepsi
 Scarfield: but i have a leash
 Astrobytes: lets stop the BDSM right here
 NewCoder09: hi
 wlesavo: unleash the  toads
 Scarfield: xD
 dbf: submits are slow again&#160;:(
 Scarfield: just walking the frog
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 wlesavo: i feel that my search will eventually became a bunch of heuristics here and there
 wlesavo: well search is already a strong word :smiley:
 Astrobytes: heuristically guided action exploration
 wlesavo: 'if' guided mess 
 Astrobytes: True AI
 dbdr: ah, the famous HGAE algorithm
 Astrobytes: was it during Ice &amp; Fire that someone came out with that True AI thing?
 Astrobytes: dbdr :D
 eulerscheZahl: pretty sure it was later. pacman or so
 BorisBarca: is distance calculated with sqrt or manhattan?
 eulerscheZahl: euclid
 Astrobytes: That much later?
 BorisBarca: thx
 Nerchio: I used manhattan until top20 
 Nerchio: cause I didn't realize it's different
 Astrobytes: lol
 dbf: :laughing:
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: at least it's faster
 kovi: i used squared dist mostly
 kovi: seems like a wasted effort wo. effective search
 SirLoxley: FYI defense only gets you up to rank 600 in silver ... Now if I only knew how to attack lol
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't even bother, sqrt all over
 eulerscheZahl: can still optimize if needed
 Nerchio: SirLoxley thanks I will keep that in mind
 MichExpatMatt: Defense got you up to 600 in silver? 
 SirLoxley: well, still ranking, but I am at 600
 DomiKo: but do you predict opponent? ;P
 SirLoxley: Don't even look at the opponent
 eulerscheZahl: i predict spiders, that must be sufficient
 DomiKo: I predict my failure
 NewCoder09: Same
 wlesavo: i cant even predict my timeouts
 Nerchio: I predict that I will hit a spider after my move, spent 10 minutes on that so it must be good
 orangesnowfox: I spent way too long figuring out how to calculate a position within the intersection of n&gt;3 circles, so
 eulerscheZahl: top50, my highest so far in this contest
 eulerscheZahl: except for first hour
 Astrobytes: :tada:
 orangesnowfox: grats euler
 eulerscheZahl: that's so low&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: plenty time
 wlesavo: euler is it a search version? 
 eulerscheZahl: nope
 wlesavo: oh ok
 AkumaHiza: Hi. I saw that my health and mana variable isn't my but boss's. It's kind of bug? How can I repair this?
 eulerscheZahl: have a search for my defense coded. but it plays worse
 eulerscheZahl: i see some cases where my heuristic fails hard. but search (or scoring) has some other flaws as well
 eulerscheZahl: do you read the boss variables and replace your own in that process AkumaHiza?
 wlesavo: euler i feel you pain
 wlesavo: your
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a pain too, that was correct
 AkumaHiza: I tried. I code in C++. "Game Input/Output" says  "Your data is always given first". So it should be correct. Earlier i have heroes_per_player and base_x / base_y. Base co-ordinates is correct.
 eulerscheZahl: default is like this:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ce520d7-5443-4ea1-8b08-bb2586b73f4a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5ce520d7-5443-4ea1-8b08-bb2586b73f4a</a>
 eulerscheZahl: this will replace the first values in the 2nd iteration of the loop obviously
 eulerscheZahl: i can assure you that the bug is on your side, the game works fine
 AkumaHiza: But i don't change these values
 jacek: "the game works fine" really, no bugs in the game? phew
 eulerscheZahl: you have to change that default code
 eulerscheZahl: the mana+health input works fine. there are certainly bugs
 avdg: hmm I rather spend cleaning up the code for my bot now, I don't have the time to get the best of my bot
 avdg: (and wow I missed a lot of chat again)
 jacek: "Spiders are neither bugs (Hemiptera) nor insects (Insecta) but a Class all their own â€“ Arachnida, or arachnids." so no bugs in the game
 eulerscheZahl: my codepublic class Bug&#160;: Entity
 eulerscheZahl: less typing than "spider"
 jacek: no wonder youre so low
 Nerchio: i have Monster xd
 aCat: I also have Monster&#160;;]
 VizGhar: I have Mob
 avdg: I stick to monster here
 eulerscheZahl: even 1 more letter than spider
 wlesavo: so you have bugs all over the code now, at least they are easy to find
 aCat: Autocompletion ^^
 avdg: if mob is used instead of monster, you safe 50% of chars per use
 avdg: :p
 Astrobytes: BadCreaturesWhoHurtMyBase here
 Schw1ngschleifer: well why use descibing names in the first place. Just go with S for spider
 avdg: CreaturesThatShouldBeAtTheOppositeSide
 Astrobytes: I like it avdg
 kaitai: does that include your heroes too?
 kovi: what about m? (it can be both monster and mob)
 avdg: or maniac
 Astrobytes: kaitai: MyHeroes and NotMyHeroes of course
 WannaBeHum1n: 270/2708 on silver
 WannaBeHum1n: feels good
 eulerscheZahl: weird submit, i blame the nature of the game100 -&gt; 170 -&gt; 50 -&gt; 86 now
 eulerscheZahl: not stable at all
 Scarfield: blame Canada
 avdg: DontLetMeDownPleaseIAlreadyTryMyBestToLetYouWin
 avdg: yeah, the heroes should solve it I guess
 JohnyDaison: eulerscheZahl do you mean right after sumbit, or submitted multiple times?
 eulerscheZahl: during submit, still not 100%
 Illedan: Yeah, very random who you meet om the way
 Illedan: I have some enemies in 100-300 that beat me every time :P
 eulerscheZahl: i've never seen such extremes in sim-based games
 Illedan: Fog..
 ItsJasper: hi all. in the description I read After an entity moves towards a point, its coordinates are truncated (when below halfway across the map) or rounded up (when above halfway across the map). Can it be that this is the inverse? looking at the source code. e.g.  let's say we are at x=2.4 and halfway point of the map is x=5. Then 2.4 - 5 = -2.6, truncate to -2, add 5 again gives 3. we just rounded up 2.4 to 3 and we are below halfway across the map
 AkumaHiza: I found my bag. Default code be like for(i&lt;2) cin&gt;&gt;health&gt;&gt;mana and this was overwriting my variable bu boss's
 Astrobytes: Are we missing any Top CG Contest Features?We have fog and incomplete info
 Astrobytes: + bugs
 ClockSort: Astrobytes what bugs?
 Illedan: There is also the cheatcodes
 Astrobytes: check the forum and/or discord
 Astrobytes: lol
 Illedan: Just use: "all your base belong to us"
 avdg: on discord there is 1 issue they might investigate later
 wlesavo: Illedan you can diasble fog in settings, this should fix it :smiley:
 Astrobytes: hahahaha
 avdg: something to do with monsters that are out of arena near base that deals damage
 eulerscheZahl: we also have slow submit and clojure timeouts
 Illedan: Ahhhh
 Astrobytes: true euler
 Illedan: Missing language update for the full experience&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: yeah, broken Java, C# and Rust woulda been fun :D
 avdg: I'm waiting for an assemblyscript option
 avdg: not sure if x86 and arm should be options too
 avdg: which I cannot work with
 dbf: lol, I've also recently submitted and float around euler's bot&#160;:)
 ItsJasper: anyone who can help me out with the example I gave above?
 JohnyDaison: why is it important? The map is 17000 wide, 1 unit means nothing
 ClockSort: if you have $17,000 does $1 mean nothing?&#160;:)
 avdg: unless it's an edge case
 ItsJasper: just want to understand if the wording in the description is incorrect or if I am not understanding the code.
 Astrobytes: off by 0.000001 means nothing in space flight
 jacek: 0.000001 parsecs?
 Astrobytes: &lt;insert unit of measurement here&gt;
 Scarfield: mole
 jacek: banana
 Scarfield: xD
 ClockSort: ItsJasper for my simulator I just copied the Java code. For my bot I just use ints and don't worry about accuracy.
 JohnyDaison: ItsJasper why are you doing this: "2.4 - 5 = -2.6, truncate to -2, add 5 again gives 3"&#160;?
 JohnyDaison: shouldn't it just be 2.4 is &lt; 5, so truncate to 2, end of story
 ItsJasper: JohnyDaison my example is like that because that's what I think the java source code does of the game. See method symmetricTruncate in the vector class.
 Ketroc: to match their calculations, truncate to ints.
 ClockSort: does GCC -O3 remove asserts?
 Astrobytes: I usually #define NDEBUG
 Astrobytes: as to O3 disabling it, not sure it does
 Astrobytes: *them
 Nerchio: blasterpoard what is this submit
 Astrobytes: you're welcome :P
 blasterpoard: Nerchio it's bad, it doesn't know what a shield is
 DomiKo: so you are still hiding?
 blasterpoard: and defense is copied from my #600 bot
 blasterpoard: no, I'm still developing the bot
 blasterpoard: this is still a very, very rough version
 Nerchio: hey i survived with 1 life
 Nerchio: thats a success
 blasterpoard: good job
 Illedan: xD
 blasterpoard: you're definitely one of my worst matchups
 Nerchio: 2 attackers is the worst matchup for me for now
 avdg: hmm wanna check how others do to my bot
 blasterpoard: now I lost a game because I yeeted a dead monster to enemy base; no, I don't look at spiders' hp either
 VizGhar: Looks like we have first legend candidate&#160;:)
 avdg: against illedan: I defend quite well but I don't attack enough, then got swamped in my own base full of monsters
 VizGhar: And he's from SK :D good job
 avdg: function keys&lt;K extends PropertyKey&gt;(m: Map&lt;K, any&gt; | { [P in K]: any }): K[] {
 blasterpoard: VizGhar not legend candidate; just a bot people will overfit against in gold

 avdg: meh, I was playing around with typing issues&#160;:-)
 avdg: failed to copy the link&#160;:/
 VizGhar: maybe... It will be very important to know where the opponent is
 VizGhar: I've made code to hit 2 creeps at once and to find shortest path for intersection
 cegprakash: can someone help me with any 30 degree and 60 degree vector.. for eg. 4i + 4j is a 45 degree vector
 VizGhar: Also very accurate guessing where the mobs are (game memory) 
 avdg: opponent location may be hard unless you have something as good as a GPU I guess
 VizGhar: but I don't have time to make search&#160;:|
 avdg: though estimating may be enough
 avdg: or doing with less precision
 VizGhar: blasterpoard you are running for mobs you clearly don't have chance to catch (not saying about killing)
 cegprakash: can someone help me with any 30 degree and 60 degree vector.. for eg. 4i + 4j is a 45 degree vector
 blasterpoard: VizGhar I'm not pretending that this is a good bot; it has a lot of problems I'm aware of
 blasterpoard: it just happens to murder silver bots
 Astrobytes: ceg your message was seen by all already, no need to spam it
 VizGhar: I'd be more than happy to have your bot :D I should sobmit my 300 ranked bot. I feel ashamed seeing yours
 VizGhar: cegprakash what?
 cegprakash: nvm I'm happy with 45 degree vector -_-
 cegprakash: for now
 Astrobytes: (I don't know either)
 JohnyDaison: 1i + sqrt(3)j
 jacek: you imagining things again
 cegprakash: thx JohnyDaison.. u have for 60 deg also?
 cegprakash: and how did u find it? some sin cos thing?
 Astrobytes: jacek: the oware stones thing we were talking with MSmits about the other day, I finally got an email

 Nerchio: is it stuck? hes pushing it into the border
 Astrobytes: ^ that's what I thought
 avdg: stuck at the fence I guess
 najedzony: Does channging monster's direction by using CONTROL last only one turn or is it permament? Anyone knows?
 wlesavo: Nerchio mine is a little bit more visual
 Kukiss: najedzony, it is permament unless it is within a base range
 avdg: oh kovi's mob is stuck at the other side of the bases
 avdg: weird
 Nerchio: yeah I guess you are right it shouldnt be stuck outside the base
 Pasora: Can i not play my past clashes?
 avdg: you can normally get your past bot with history
 avdg: and you can play against your bot in arena

 MACKEYTH: Combined vectors. Just like wind
 cegprakash: who gets the control
 avdg: democracy
 cegprakash: I see..
 cegprakash: so all 3 gets control

 blasterpoard: Nerchio now there will be
 Astrobytes: heh heh
 blasterpoard: until now, everyone wsa so defensive
 cegprakash: OOO MYYY GOOD I fixed a SHIELD bug..
 Abdi-29: we;ll done
 Abdi-29: i have tiny bug on my code
 Astrobytes: you made it not stink when you step on it? :smirk:
 Abdi-29: my hero 0 is doing whatever he wants
 cegprakash: Abdi-29 what does he want
 avdg: almost half my logic of the just not 1500 lines is planning code
 avdg: meh, "simplifying" that
 Abdi-29: no clue, he just goes to help the enimies 
 YuToutCourt: Do someone know what is the memory limit&#160;?
 blasterpoard: 768 MB
 avdg: though I wonder how you got memory constrained
 udu: Is there a version control to restore the code?
 Astrobytes: easily done depending on what you are doing
 Astrobytes: udu: yes, it's called git and you should try it
 avdg: memoize everything?
 udu: haha, I was not smart enough and trusted the browser ide
 udu: I mean here in the codingame ide ...?
 Astrobytes: more about memory allocation avdg
 YuToutCourt: I was just wondering, I have no problem with memory 
 avdg: you can get your source back from history, at least if you submitted your ai
 udu: oh thank you actually obvious panel -.- sorry
 Astrobytes: udu: if you pressed 'play my code' or 'test in arena' it should still be there, plus as avdg said you can use the history tab
 avdg: about memory: I would use as less as possible, the less memory it needs, the more data/code there is in CPU caches
 Astrobytes: when you need 25 million MCTS nodes allocated upfront...
 avdg: continuous memory&#160;:-)

 wlesavo: im just kidding :slight_smile: just waited for you to submit to see how that strat will rec me 
 blasterpoard: the strat is bad and I already know that I will have to play quite differently later on
 wlesavo: but for now im wrecking myself =(
 VizGhar: omg your bot has so many (hopefully easily fixable) bugs blaster... wonder what you will come up with in 6 days
 blasterpoard: but this is a fun bot and I'm OK with people optimizing against it
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: gotta check yoself before yo wreck yoself
 blasterpoard: now I wait and see whether this makes it to legend
 cegprakash: VizGhar it's not a bug if it works 
 Illedan: I think so
 cegprakash: that's what I tell my manager at least
 cegprakash: :D
 Astrobytes: oooosh just checked the score you finished on. I think so, yes
 kovi: gratz blasterpoard, impressive
 VizGhar: cegprakash he is using wind against shielded bots&#160;:) he's not using shield himself...
 blasterpoard: thx kovi
 VizGhar: he will squeeze more of it for sure
 blasterpoard: the bot doesn't know what a shield is
 cegprakash: self shield is for kids
 cegprakash: real men take the hit and counter
 cegprakash: that's a 10 extra mana VizGhar 
 Astrobytes: :expressionless:
 cegprakash: for the first time I'm entering top 150 and I have lots to improve in attack and defense.. feeling hopeful
 cegprakash: will I get a T shirt..
 cegprakash: I donno if ppl are sleeping or I'm that good
 cegprakash: or ppl hiding good bots
 Astrobytes: pretty sure you say that every contest
 Astrobytes: :D
 Eacaw: Has anyone managed to get this to run locally? Using cg-brutaltester?
 cegprakash: Astrobytes seriously I can't believe why my bot is in top 150 with really nothing -_- just bug reduction since bronze..
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: volatile league though bro, very rps in a lot of ways
 cegprakash: fixing 1 losing game at a time
 cegprakash: 1 bug at a time
 cegprakash: adding 5 iffs seem easier than writing a sim :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 avdg: refactoring code here instead of fixing bugs, I have too much planning code
 jacek: prune array eh
 cegprakash: jacek no minimax this time
 Astrobytes: jacek :D we already did the prune array jokes
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Illedan: 2 IFs and this Twood tripple winder lost xD
 Astrobytes: lol
 cegprakash: there is a real chance for Bob to win this contest 
 Illedan: Even won blaster with that fix
 Illedan: ^^
 cegprakash: Bob is the master of if else
 elderlybeginner: when gold opens for spring challenge?
 Bob: cegprakash stop you're going to make me bblush
 Bob: and just no way
 blasterpoard: Illedan countering my bot isn't hard, but noone had ifs for it until an hour ago
 Bob: hundreds above me are obviouslt better at if elses than I am
 Illedan: In submit now
 Illedan: I win you about 50&#160;%
 Illedan: in those few games I tried
 Illedan: Make that 40&#160;%
 Illedan: I'll accept a high 30&#160;% even
 Astrobytes: heh
 blasterpoard: good
 blasterpoard: optimize against it
 Astrobytes: blaster playing the mind games
 Illedan:&#160;:)
 Illedan: He got the counter to the counter to the counter to the counter to the counter
 blasterpoard: did you notice that it doesn't use any spells before gathering 220 mana?
 cegprakash: lets counter the counter to the counter to the counter to the counter to the counter
 Illedan: Fun threshold
 Astrobytes: yes, that makes some amusing sense
 Illedan: Why?
 blasterpoard: because it can only gather or go berkers
 blasterpoard: *berserk
 blasterpoard: no in-between
 blasterpoard: and it's just a ranbom number to make sure I don't run out of mana before killing you
 Astrobytes: amusing because 2200...
 blasterpoard: and yes, that's why 220 Astrobytes&#160;:)
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 wlesavo: 128 would be better then :slight_smile:
 blasterpoard: I was starting to bet worried that no one would get the joke
 Illedan: lol
 blasterpoard: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624880558">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/624880558</a> wlesavo 128 vs 220; 128 is definitely better
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 blasterpoard: just enough for 3 controls and 9 winds
 Illedan: Ah, fack. My fix made a bunch of bugs :D
 dinggg: Does anyone know why, after I control a spider and point it to the enemy base, it turns back around the move after?
 BJD: is it in your base?
 wlesavo: do you control witihin your base?
 dinggg: Good point! Thanks haha
 dinggg: bed time I guess
 wlesavo: but seriously blasterpoard's bot makes me wanna quit my pseudo search. that and the fact that it's broken again  
 wlesavo: i feel like i lost the last tiny bit of understanding of the game that thought i had
 Illusive: hh
 Illusive: why is it console.log, like bro is that shit some birch or sumting
 Wiilss: guys why is it c++ but not c--?

 Illusive: #sigmamalegrindset
 JRFerguson: i'm not understanding how to determine where a controlled hero will move
 Astrobytes: MODS: children alert
 JRFerguson: there is no vx vy in the inputs
 JRFerguson: am i missing something&#160;?
 Kellthazar: vx vy is only for monsters I guess
 Wiilss: :strawberry:
 Kellthazar: spiders*
 Astrobytes: only the monsters velocities are given JRFerguson
 Illedan: JRFerguson, you can't know
 Dapps: It would be amazing if we could know
 Astrobytes: All it will do is move it in the direction you pushed it plus whatever direction it's going in already iiuc
 Illusive: how do I Initialize vector without copying and using move semantics
 JRFerguson: thanks for the answers, it seems rather strange that we can't know this information
 Astrobytes: add it to the strangeness list :D
 JRFerguson: :joy:
 Kellthazar: You can track the lastPosition of heroes and calculate the "velocity" from that. 
 pedrosorio: Kellthazar if you receive an input that says one of your heroes is controlled, it will move this turn, so looking at the current position (and last) is not really useful to achieve JRFerguson's goal, I guess
 JRFerguson: exactly
 Illusive: how do I Initialize vector without copying and using move semantics
 Ketroc: how does hero attack range work?  Clearly "After a hero's move phase, any monsters within 800 units will suffer 2 points of damage." is not correct.
 Larbino: when does the gold league open&#160;?
 Wiilss: fortnite balls all in your face
 Astrobytes: struct
 Wiilss: struct
 Wiilss: struct mystruct.gov
 Illusive: struct please deal with this neanderthal
 Wiilss: bro he needs to upgrade to classes
 Wiilss: mans stuck in c 89
 Wiilss: bussy boy

 Astrobytes: 5DN1L, Bob, nicola
 Astrobytes: Magus
 Wiilss: balls fortnite and among us :skull:
 ClockSort: are the heroes of each player always the first to be provided via stdin?
 Bob: nope
 Astrobytes: 0,1,2 or 3,4,5
 Bob: if you are player 2 your heroes come second
 ClockSort: but heroes always come before mobs?
 Astrobytes: P1 &amp; P2 respectively
 Astrobytes: what Bob said
 Astrobytes: Bob, have the children been taken care of
 ClockSort: you see, I'm 4 days into the contest, ~600  lines of code, and finally reading the input :D
 Bob: looks like it, dbdr was here first
 Astrobytes: gotcha, dbdr, some textual input would be nice, I can't see that anymore remember :P
 Astrobytes: ClockSort: Same for me until yesterday lol
 Astrobytes: ClockSort: did you get my reply regarding -O3 and assert?
 ClockSort: yep I did, thanks so much Astrobytes
 ClockSort: I will assert with confidence&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: np
 Astrobytes: hahaha :D
 Zedidiah: Is there a way to tell how much time has passed since a turn has started?
 Astrobytes: yes, start a timer in your language after reading the first input
 Astrobytes: don't do it anywhere else or you'll get a wrong reading
 Astrobytes: so in this case, after reading base x and base y, start timer
 Zedidiah: ok, I wasn't sure if the first timer started at complation or if it was after the input. 
 cegprakash: okay I now have a decent attacker should be able to get into top 20 with this submit I guess. lets see
 cegprakash: T shirt dream is real
 Ketroc: fyi, in case someone had the same headache for me:  heroes are moved, then attacks are done, then spiders are moved.  So it's like you attack the prev position of each spider
 cegprakash: Ketroc same I had the head ache
 ClockSort: I spent two days headaching the provided Java code and I still struggled with that simple fact :P
 icecream17: what my code was so bad how do i get to wood 1 overnight
 Bbrainstormer: Lmao i have no idea what to do
 Astrobytes: time for a brainstorming session
 dbf: I'll brainstorm during the sleep&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: :D
 Spressed: My brain hurtz hehe
 Spressed: Hello lads
 cegprakash: so no one is able to beat Blasterboard's meta now nice -_-
 andyyyyy: Probably just need to make some sort of prioritization to cast wind on as many spiders as possible
 Spressed: I can't even do the simple temperatures one, I should just give up XD
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: no, this now adds a meta to counter and work from
 cegprakash: and I don't see anyone with 2 defenders defending him
 Astrobytes: and provide *ideas*
 cegprakash: what can human race do against such a rage
 Astrobytes: Spressed: no you should keep trying
 a-Rye: Spressed try The Descent or Mars Lander 1. Those are really easy once you sift through the instructions
 Astrobytes: So is Temperatures&#160;;) Just think it through properly. I always recommend using a whiteboard or pen &amp; paper to work through a testcase or 2 
 a-Rye: ^^true, or talk to rubber ducks (explain what you're trying to do to an inanimate object that won't talk back)
 a-Rye: In addition to writing it out I mean. It's good to really "see" the problem, both drawn out and be able to understand what's going on
 Kukiss: animated objects are fine too. My dog sometimes looks like he enjoys the attention
 Astrobytes: Yeah definitely, to both&#160;:)
 a-Rye: ah yes, pets are great too! lol
 Astrobytes: My cats and any visiting relatives have had to suffer this frequently :D
 Astrobytes: I swear the cat in my avatar judges my code when she sits in my lap.
 Kukiss: an he plays the piano!
 Kukiss: or she
 Astrobytes: lol, that used to be a ducky keyboard but Scarfield made a little 'enhancement' to the picture
 Astrobytes: She, yeah 
 Alurian: why do any and all 'improvements' make me drop ranks
 Astrobytes: Welcome to a CG contest!
 cegprakash: submits stuck again
 cegprakash:&#160;:\
 Astrobytes: really? At this time?
 Alurian: makes me doubt myself :joy: going from 160 to 1000
 cegprakash: yeah I've been waiting for my rank 20 submit for a looong time
 Astrobytes: I thought they were just slow
 cegprakash: been more than an hour since submit and I'm at 28%
 Astrobytes: Alurian: it happens, especially in games like this with a lot of RPS 
 Alurian: whats rps
 Astrobytes: ah, rock paper scissors
 Alurian: aah
 Alurian: guess im gonna be resubmitting my first bot in the morningg
 Astrobytes: One strategy beats another that beats the other that beats the first etc
 Alurian: simple seems best tho
 cegprakash: rock paper scissors has equal prob for rock, paper, scissors to win
 Alurian: everytime i try to add some complexness ranks drops by 600
 cegprakash: when most opponents are paper better to go with scissors -_-
 Astrobytes: the slow submits don't help with testing admittedly
 Alurian: yes that to
 Alurian: have to wait an hour before i know i failed
 cegprakash: if this is the case now think about last 2 days of the contest
 Astrobytes: but take notes from the top 
 Astrobytes: slow submits gives time to watch and get ideas
 Astrobytes: cegprakash: submits were 7hrs + the other day lol
 cegprakash: slow submits gives time to chat here
 cegprakash: ^_^
 Astrobytes: they had to reduce the number of battles in Bronze to 50
 Astrobytes: battles per submit I mean
 cegprakash: think they need to do it in silver too as silver is pretty crowded
 cegprakash: hopefully silver boss is hard
 Astrobytes: it's not that bad, that's why they have gold league after all
 Astrobytes: there was like 4000+ in BRonze when that was happening
 cegprakash: currently SIlver - 2806 Bronze - 2097 Wood1- 784 Wood2 - 189 ppl.. that makes SIlver most crowded which is the highest league
 Astrobytes: sure, I get that
 blasterpoard: large league is really a problem only in gold, because before that it's usually not hard to promote, but gold can get so big that even a good bot will not get above boss
 cegprakash: usually crowd is expected at Bronze I agree.. Silver disagree
 Astrobytes: blasterpoard: +1:
 Astrobytes: or&#160;:+1:
 cegprakash: imagine a meta beat silver boss.. everyone would use it to reach gold and it'll be pretty crowded again
 cegprakash: silver boss should be made really hard
 cegprakash: to regulate gold and legend
 Astrobytes: well following your logic, why not extend that to wood?
 cegprakash: I'm happy with a parabola
 nightwalkerinthedark: my brother is barhouch
 cegprakash: wood 2 &lt; wood 1 &lt; Bronze &gt; Silver &gt; Gold &gt; legend in terms of crowd
 cegprakash: most crowd should be in bronze
 Astrobytes: ...
 Astrobytes: yeah ceg, it kinda naturally works out that way anyway
 Astrobytes: this time around I feel CG are not giving this contest much attention anyway so... not much point debating it :D
 Westicles: what do you mean by meta?
 Astrobytes: the overriding strategy
 Westicles: oh, so we all copy his strategy and get to gold
 Astrobytes: well, sort of. It's the dominant strat at whatever time, it begs to be beaten somehow
 Astrobytes: gaming terminology, always lame
 Astrobytes: :P
 Ketroc: not meta, but I've seen a few bots stack their heroes and launch spiders into the goal from mid-map with triple WIND
 ddreams: yeah, just look at the top bot now
 ddreams: blasterpoard
 ddreams: pro farming too
 Astrobytes: Ketroc: that WAS the meta for a bit
 Astrobytes: ddreams: yes, blasterpoard is setting the meta currently :D
 blasterpoard: for a day or 2 until counter-ifs appear
 Astrobytes: if even that long
 cegprakash: I am thinking about shielding monsters near my base to counter blasterpoard lol
 Astrobytes: I  don't even like this contest, I must admit. I'm just playing because we don't get much on CG these days
 cegprakash: I really see no other way
 cegprakash: I tried pushing  away he just comes back
 Astrobytes: Use the cheatcode ceg
 Astrobytes: anyway, see you all later, take care everyone
 cegprakash: bye Astrobytes
 FlamingLongcoat_1370: hey guys, I've just came back and reworked a solution so I can get an achievement. I've covered the condition and submitted my solution and got 100&#160;% score but the achievement isn't appearing
 BrunoFelthes: blasterpoard is a genius hauhauha
 FlamingLongcoat_1370: any ideas what I need to do to get it to register?
 BrunoFelthes: blasterpoard is it only heuristics?
 blasterpoard:&#160;:)
 Westicles: flaming, maybe wait a bit.  the whole site is slammed with the contest
 cegprakash: BrunoFelthes he just doin more paper work than coding a sim -_-
 kreska: hi I have a question. If i want to use a spell and calculate if monster is inside the reach of a spell should i calculate distance to monster current position or to monster next round position?
 blasterpoard: current
 BrunoFelthes: what you mean by paper work cegprakash?
 cegprakash: more drawings
 cegprakash: even Blasterpoard can't himself defend against him
 BrunoFelthes: i did a GA, and it was a disaster
 cegprakash: none of his games cross over 90 turns
 cegprakash: even against himself
 BrunoFelthes: now i'm only using heuristics... #27 now
 icecream17: wow I finally compiled rust for the *2nd* time
 kreska: blasterpoard thanks
 BrunoFelthes: and i'm using the 3 heroes to defend only
 BrunoFelthes: winning only by mana&#160;:/
 ddreams: nice
 FlamingLongcoat_1370: thanks Westicles!
 aatj: kreska The only exception is if you want to target enemy hero with wind. The enemy hero is moved in this round before the wind is applied to them. It's possible they could move out of range
 icecream17: under "Monsters will appear randomly but symmetrically" are they guaranteed to appear with 180 deg symmetry?
 ddreams: that appears to be true
 kreska: aatj thank you very much i had this feeling this is the case
 aatj: If you look in the problem text, you can see the order with which actions are applied. 
 kreska: aatj i need to llok at this but to be honest i think that sometimes monsters get out of the reach to but maybe i dont see the bug in my code
 kreska: aatj and one more thing is that sometimes if i apply control on the monster and in the next round apply windthe monster do not obey control even if monster is not close to the base
 aatj: Control is applied on the next round, wind is applied on the current round, so I think  your spells are conflicting
 kreska: aatj omg thank you so i really got to look at the order of actions
 aatj: I mean: control are applied to targets the current round, but are only effective the next turn:turn 1: control appliedturn 2: control effective, vwind applied, wind effective
 kreska: aatj yes i imediately understood it even looked that way in the game visualizer
 aatj: Yes, I only relooked at them today, and they expose a number of problems
 kreska: but if that is the case the control should be obeyed i think i dont know i need to understand it
 kreska: becuase i apply control on the monster and on the next round when monster should respond to control i put wind and then monster do not respond to control just get pushed
 kreska: at least sometimes
 kreska: i dont know if this work like this allways 
 aatj: Doesn't wind, if they land outside the base, randomize the direction anyway?
 kreska: so my understanding was that this is the case if oyu pushed them outside the base
 kreska: only if you pushed them from the base outside but i dont know anymore
 kreska: because inside the radius they are attracted to the base if you pushed them outside they stop beeing attracted and get some new random direction
 kreska: at least this is my understanding i'm not sure
 icecream17: "Each subsequent monster may have slightly more starting health than any previous monster." does this mean subsequent monsters always have &gt;= previous monsters
 dbdr: yes
 dbdr: every second wave has more more health
 icecream17: does one player always start at 0, 0?
 Fox787: I see blasterpoard submitted
 Ketroc: @icecream17 yep.  and instructions have the coords for the other spawn pos
 Dapps: let's see how high is new bot goes..
 Fox787: rank 1 currently Dapps
 Ketroc: spider maxHP slowly goes up as the games goes on.  first round is 13hp.  by step200 they are around 24hp'ish
 Tuo: spiders start at 10 maxHp. Approximate formula that i use is maxHp = 10 + turn // 10
 Fallback: If a mob is exactly 5000 units away from a base, does it count as being inside or outside?
 orangesnowfox: inside

 AlishaMei: Hello!
 SashaNukem: Hi
 BrunoFelthes: hi
 MACKEYTH: Heya
 ijc90: Hi
 ijc90: I need winning strategy... i did print("blue wins") but it works half of the time
 ijc90: Real question here: does wind change where the monster is facing? is there any reliable way to predict this?
 snoyes: I think it does not, unless they were targeting a base and blown out of range. Then new direction is random.
 ijc90: I think I saw that happen, changing direction when otuside base, but not sure if maintaining previous one
 ijc90: Is there a way to know if your heroe will be controlled?
 ijc90: the control command happened last turn, so it should be
 DollarAkshay: You can uset the isControlled field
 ijc90: thanks!
 Ketroc: wind only changes the trajectory on a spider if you WIND it from in your base zone to out of your base zone
 DollarAkshay: Hey was the setting to turn off the fog of war under Manual options?
 struct: turning off for the game or viewer?
 struct: DollarAkshay
 DollarAkshay: game
 DollarAkshay: there was some setting that someone shared yesterday
 DollarAkshay: I forgot what it was
 struct: Are you sure that is possible?
 benobab: it's on bottom right of the viewer in the IDE
 DollarAkshay: No no not the viewer.
 DollarAkshay: I think it is possible to @struct
 DollarAkshay: You can set the seed and for of ward settings
 struct: ok I figured it out
 struct: ENABLE_FOG=false doesnt work
 struct: but BASE_VIEW_RADIUS=100000
 struct: does
 DollarAkshay: LOL I guess that works for ME 
 DollarAkshay: haha Thank you @struct
 PatrickMcGinnisII: someone was trying last night,  it parses all params as int, ENABLE_FOG=0 did not work
 struct: my way works
 PatrickMcGinnisII: for fog?
 struct: yes
 DollarAkshay: BASE_VIEW_RADIUS=100000
 struct: it will make your base see everything
 struct: look how I tie vs rank 1

 nvkha: Hi, how to use spell wind with correct derection
 Jerrasterix: just push them to your opp's base coord
 Jerrasterix: SPELL WIND oppBaseX oppBaseY
 Rombolt: Can we already access the Gold league? Is it opened yet?
 Jerrasterix: nope
 Rombolt: Ok, thx
 Kururugi: when would it open?

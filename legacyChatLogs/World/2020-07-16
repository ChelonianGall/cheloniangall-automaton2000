 WINWINWIN: python is almost the best for clash of code, second only to ruby.
 cegprakash: hey someone sent me an awesome video on alpha beta pruning in the past
 cegprakash: and I missed it
 cegprakash: does someone has that link
 cegprakash: I think struct shared me that link
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I haven't seen one, sry
 cegprakash: found it

 cegprakash: looks like I had it in my youtube playlist :D
 Andriamanitra: does ruby have something equivalent to python's [::2]
 DeWill: Still it have many other advantage....
 Andriamanitra: i know, i love ruby but i'm doing some insanely convoluted stuff just to get every nth character of a string
 Andriamanitra: i guess s.each_char.select.with_index{|c,i| i%2==0}.join is about good as it gets, not as nice as simple s[::2]

 Andriamanitra: yeah that's what i was looking at
 Andriamanitra: i found a little bit shorter way though, not sure if as readable: s.chars.values_at(*0.step(s.length-1,2)).join
 OhayouWIbu: hello guys

 DomiKo: just reading
 DomiKo: need to read sth to improve mcts

 rubber_duckie: is discord down everywhere? or is it just my country
 rubber_duckie: almost every website i try to access is down today...
 tomatoes: works 
 Andriamanitra: some of these clash problems are insane
 Andriamanitra: 7 players and everyone got 0% :laughing:
 DomiKo: 7 players but are they good players?
 MSmits: hey guys
 DomiKo: hi&#160;;)
 MSmits: I have a question
 DomiKo: uuu
 MSmits: how do I store data as characters in the IDE
 MSmits: using their byte encoding
 MSmits: everyone who's ever done a NN here knows thi
 MSmits: but i cant find any examples
 MSmits: 2 bytes per character
 DomiKo: hmmm
 MSmits: in c++ specifically. I have been able to make something work in C#
 MSmits: long time ago though
 MSmits: say i have a 16 bit integer
 tomatoes: 2 bytes as unicode codepoint =&gt; utf8 character
 MSmits: yes how do i do that
 DomiKo: wchar?
 MSmits: o idea
 MSmits: n
 tomatoes: manual shifts and ors üëÄ
 MSmits: I dont mean the bits part
 MSmits: i mean how to write an actual 16 bit integer as a single character
 DomiKo: so if i understand what you mean
 DomiKo: you can use
 DomiKo: u32string
 DomiKo: read normal string
 DomiKo: and then using this magic stuff
 MSmits: doesnt that use 4 bytes per character?
 DomiKo: wstring_convert&lt;codecvt_utf8&lt;char32_t&gt;, char32_t&gt; conv;
 DomiKo: hmm you need 16
 DomiKo: hmmm
 MSmits: the IDE understands 16 max
 MSmits: i think
 MSmits: basically what i want is to be able to offline put data into characters, paste the code into the IDE and when it runs, convert it back to data
 MSmits: so that i can make maximum use of codesize
 MSmits: IDE allows 100k characters, 2 bytes per character
 tomatoes: ide count 3byte utf8 as 1 character
 MSmits: 3??
 MSmits: interesting, so i can store even more data then?
 tomatoes: no
 tomatoes: too many control bits
 MSmits: man... I wish someone wrote a guide about how to do this
 tomatoes: encoding in python chr(int16).encode(‚Äòutf-8‚Äô) should work. but dont know about c++
 MSmits: hmm and how to get it back from utf-8 back to int16?
 tomatoes: check utf8 wiki page
 tomatoes: 1110xxxx	10xxxxxx	10xxxxxx	
 MSmits: ok will do thanks
 tomatoes: x‚Äôs are writable, 10 fixed
 tomatoes: and 4 bytes utf8 count as 2 symbols in ide, kinda useless
 RoboStac: I use <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536">https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536</a> for encoding and then have c++ code to decode it
 MSmits: thanks Robo, will check that out
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/82733bd9-0058-4500-8828-3bdc0fce1535">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/82733bd9-0058-4500-8828-3bdc0fce1535</a>
 MSmits: ohh nice c++ code even
 derjack: msmits doing NN? :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: or a larger opening book
 MSmits: non NN no
 MSmits: openingbook is one of the things yes
 MSmits: not sure what else. It's just something I've wanted to know how to do
 tomatoes: it seems base65536 use 4 bytes utf8 too. which are not good for CG
 derjack: endtables?
 MSmits: those too derjack, can use those for bandas
 MSmits:  for oware too, but i've found that the tables you generate in the first second are bigger than the ones that fit into codesoze
 MSmits: codesize
 MSmits: not sure how it is for bandas
 MSmits: codesize = max 5 seeds i think, i do 6 seeds generating them in 1st second
 derjack: or make endtables into c++ std and #include those *_*
 Astrobytes: #include &lt;win&gt;
 MSmits: if that were possible&#160;:)
 tomatoes: too suspicious 
 wlesavo: #include &lt;top3bot&gt;
 eulerscheZahl: tomatoes 03:12PMit seems base65536 use 4 bytes utf8 too. which are not good for CG
 tomatoes: i checked in golf mode and some symbols count as 2
 tomatoes: íÑ†
 MSmits: probably because they are more than 2 bytes
 tomatoes: for example
 MSmits: so are you saying that this base65536 thingy sometimes converts 2 bytes to something that counts as more than 1 character?
 tomatoes: i think it works but possible to compress better
 RoboStac: it may well be possible to be better, but it was a massive improvement over base85 and didn't require much thought&#160;:)
 MSmits: hmm but if you need the full range of 16 bit integers you will always need characters that require more than 2 bytes right?
 MSmits: because of control characters and whatnot?
 eulerscheZahl: but as how many chars does this count? Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§Ã§
 MSmits: oh noes
 eulerscheZahl: :rofl:
 MSmits: *euler trollmode off
 eulerscheZahl: deep inside i'm still a little child
 tomatoes: i'm not sure but it seems cg counts 1-2-3 bytes utf8 as 1 character and 4 bytes utf8 as 2 characters
 MSmits: true euler
 MSmits: thats weird tomatoes
 Astrobytes: chat vandal!
 eulerscheZahl: gotta enjoy the last days of trolling before the new mods get added
 tomatoes: 3 bytes utf8 has 16 "free" bit. and 4 bytes utf8 has 21 free bits (or 10.5 per character)
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits:  makes sense then tomatoes
 tomatoes: i dont know how cg counts it inside, but random 4 bytes gives "code size: 2"
 tomatoes: and random 3 or less always code size: 1
 RoboStac: it would explain why I've struggled to work out exactly how big to make networks that'll fit
 tomatoes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+12120">https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+12120</a> that weird glyph
 RoboStac: and instead just keep shrinking them until cg stops complaining
 RoboStac: never thought of checking on code golf though
 tomatoes: hmm. what if golf and submit count all this things differently :thinking:
 tomatoes: i checked only golf
 RoboStac: it does seem to match - code golf says my othello is 95000 
 RoboStac: and I knew it was close
 RoboStac: whereas wc says its 78k chars / 193000 bytes
 derjack: do you use some compression?
 MSmits: RoboStac do i understand correctly that I have to print my integers as 8 bit ascii characters that it then encodes into unicode characters?
 MSmits: "ab" seemed to be turned into one character wheras "abc" became 2
 RoboStac: on the python encoding side I'm passing a bytearray in, not ascii
 MSmits: ah ok, but i am not using python so it will be reading a file 
 RoboStac: yeah, but is it a binary file? encoding text makes no sense
 jacek: well i encode opening book which is text into unicode
 jacek: saves exactly 2x space
 MSmits: i am not sure what a binary file is compared to a text file tbh
 MSmits: i have always worked with text files
 jacek: print("ab".decode("utf-16")) becomes some chinese char
 MSmits: Èù°
 MSmits:&#160;?
 jacek: yes. and c++: wstring text = L"..."
 MSmits: what does that dp&#160;?
 MSmits: do
 jacek: for (auto &amp; c&#160;: text) {
 MSmits: yeah thats what i was thinking
 MSmits: c is 16 bit&#160;?
 jacek: so you have wstring text = L"‰î±„ùÜÂôÑ„ô≥‰îæ‰πèÂµëÁç†‰å±ÂôÜ‰ê∂ÊÖó" and decode into string normal_text and do whatever you waznt
 jacek: actually i dont know o.O. i think
 jacek: or is it wchar
 MSmits: well it looks like 16 bit the way you are shifting it
 jacek: as long as it works, i dont care
 jacek: *ML expert*
 MSmits: lol
 jacek: bbl
 Zachary_0722: is python the most frequent language?
 eulerscheZahl: what's your scope for the question?on the whole world? for clash of code shortest mode? for ...?

 FlatJelly_17bc: thankss
 Astrobytes: np
 FlatJelly_17bc: what topics do you think the test includes
 FlatJelly_17bc: for a junior
 swordwielder: I wish I knew
 Astrobytes: I couldn't say, it might be similar problems that you'll find in the puzzle sections, or it could be custom-designed by your prospective employers
 swordwielder: I have a coderpad interview tomorrow too.
 swordwielder: any good suggestion on how to prepare
 Astrobytes: I don't know anything about coderpad tbh, sorry
 Apocrypha_blank_01: Whats the easier way to count how many nodes were visited with minimax&#160;?

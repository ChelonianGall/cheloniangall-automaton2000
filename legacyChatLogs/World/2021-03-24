 nanas21: hi huys
 ihost: don't understand what this question for....., any tips?
 dluiscosta: hey, is there any "shortest code" challenge, like we have in clash of code, but that is time limited and lets you improve further as you like?
 dluiscosta: that is NOT time limited*
 Alpanhiem: Hello I am pretty new to programming and I was wondering what the best challenge thing for me was because I just clicked on one and I had no idea what it was saying.
 ihost: me too
 ihost: don't understand what the description says..... it's really confused
 dluiscosta: probably start with the LEARN tab to read through the basics and then start with one of the easiest challenges
 dluiscosta: conditions first, then loops
 dluiscosta: also, choose a language with high level of abstraction and high readability to start of
 dluiscosta: like Python
 Stormalix: or JavaScript
 Stormalix: you can also learn from other sources like Khan Academy
 ihost: no, just the description.....
 Stormalix: i learned to code JavaScript on Khan Academy and it was very helpful and easy to learn
 Stormalix: is English your first language&#160;?
 ihost: oh, im on the wrong channel..
 ihost: sorry guys
 Stormalix: ahahaah
 Stormalix: its ok

 kira_kira: in javascript, how to print using "print"??
 WOLFRAHH: i can't understand your question kira_kira
 WOLFRAHH: or in Js there is not use of print like as python
 BlaiseEbuth: There is
 kira_kira: how?
 BlaiseEbuth: print(something)
 WOLFRAHH: hey BlaiseEbuth 
 kira_kira: shows me an error
 Notter: document.write()?
 imathwee: hi does anyone know
 BlaiseEbuth: hey WOLFRAHH
 imathwee: how to play test cases with keyboard shortcut
 BlaiseEbuth: What error&#160;?
 imathwee: instead of clicking the button
 WOLFRAHH: in Js how we can use print
 WOLFRAHH: its not possible
 WOLFRAHH: BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: ctrl+enter imathwee
 imathwee: ty that was killing me
 imathwee:&#160;:)
 WOLFRAHH: not killing you imathwee BlaiseEbuth is right
 BlaiseEbuth: I'm not
 BlaiseEbuth: I don't use js. I just tested, and print works. Though the editor say it's deprecated.
 WOLFRAHH: ohh
 WOLFRAHH: so his or her question is how to use print in Js
 WOLFRAHH: but it is not possible 
 imathwee: all i need to do is set up a few shortcuts in mac and i'm set
 imathwee: like some macros or summat
 WOLFRAHH: BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: What?
 WOLFRAHH: so his or her question is how to use print in Jsbut it is not possible 
 WOLFRAHH: this
 WOLFRAHH: BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Like I said, it's possible.
 Legen: you can do print = console.log
 Legen: and do print(something)
 WOLFRAHH: how
 WOLFRAHH: ohh
 WOLFRAHH: i see
 WOLFRAHH: okk BlaiseEbuth you are right
 BlaiseEbuth: :expressionless:
 WOLFRAHH: sorry
 WOLFRAHH: guess who i am 
 WOLFRAHH: BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: RobinHood&#160;? :thinking:
 WOLFRAHH: How u know it
 WOLFRAHH: that i am RobinHood
 BlaiseEbuth: Who else will ask me to guess... :expressionless:
 WOLFRAHH: you are right
 Legen: ha ha
 WOLFRAHH: why ha ha Legen u know me
 Legen: jsut fill like
 WOLFRAHH: how to make a solo game in codingame BlaiseEbuth
 BlaiseEbuth: Stop ping me like this.
 kira_kira: i saw some people use print, but when i do, shows me error
 derjack: what language
 derjack: in js there would be stroke, but it would work
 imathwee: only pos 1400
 imathwee: 14000
 imathwee: lol
 imathwee: forgot an extra zero
 imathwee: one more then some actual work

 magaiti: as a matter of fact 15cm is average, not big
 magaiti: so yeah
 creeperZnation4: What an interesting discussion I find myself reading first thing in the morning XD
 AntiSquid: but his could be smaller and we don't want fake news spreading around here
 magaiti: a matter of life, universe an everything
 magaiti: i am more concerned about misinformation about statistical averages rather than sizes of individual represenatives

 AntiSquid: uhm ...
 Therabidpanther: ya know... it happens lol
 snoyes: and the expected output is the same... so I get all green lights just doing "print(input())"
 Tuo: if you turn \x444550524543415445440a

 derjack: what did you do so far
 AntiSquid: and only play clash&#160;? 
 AntiSquid: clash and golf
 plevande: mostly...is it obvious?
 derjack: this site is more than just clashes :v
 AntiSquid: you're better off wasting time with casual gaming than clash
 Kitkat260: yep
 plevande: what do you mean casual gaming
 derjack: he doesnt like clashes because he always loses
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. There's clashes on the site&#160;?
 AntiSquid: actual computer games @_@
 Kitkat260: yay
 plevande: I don't always lose
 plevande: But what else is good on this site
 derjack: puzzles, multiplayer bot games
 BlaiseEbuth: *what is good
 Wontonimo: hey Kitkat260, you try anything other than CoC&#160;?  Did you ever try the mars lander thing?
 plevande: The problem is the clashes, I just keep saying "oh I'll just do on more"
 AntiSquid: close clash go to main page and never click clash again, life is worth living
 Wontonimo: try this puzzle.  start by just looping through "Up", "Left", "Right", "Up", "Left" (don't do down) <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/2048">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/2048</a>

 eulerscheZahl: JLukeSkywalker 03:33PMwhat does it mean when you look up a clash on the puzzle search, but it doesnt let you test in ide?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451655c809e713c763785c043df57a078901">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/451655c809e713c763785c043df57a078901</a>
 eulerscheZahl: known bug: the community bot edited the puzzle (removed one mode) and thus created a new revision
 eulerscheZahl: also: Microsoft wants to take over  discord :scream:
 AntiSquid: damn the last one ...
 eulerscheZahl: i think discord doesn't add enough value for me to stick with it in case it should happen
 Marchete: I'm about to beat that damn toad
 eulerscheZahl: for github i wasn't happy either but stayed
 eulerscheZahl: why beat the toad?
 eulerscheZahl: still better than without the "b" i guess
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/number-shifting/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/optimization/number-shifting/leaderboard</a>
 AntiSquid: on github they removed a repo just because the code was to download youtube videos ... wow . 
 eulerscheZahl: oh wow, you got back to it
 Marchete: wait for it
 AntiSquid: and then they removed anything related to that
 eulerscheZahl: wtf
 AntiSquid: and probably went on to do ore shit like that
 Marchete: bam!
 eulerscheZahl: i know, i messed up and you can't submit the solution to 1000
 eulerscheZahl: congrats, you won the game
 Marchete: I don't know
 Marchete: I thought it ended at 999
 eulerscheZahl: that's the end, yes
 Marchete: so I prepared to stop the bots at that point
 eulerscheZahl: how long did you have to run your code to get there?
 Marchete: to my surprise some 900+ levels take 10 minutes
 eulerscheZahl: they get easier?
 Marchete: mainly, yes
 Marchete: "but"
 Marchete: once I get the right algo
 Marchete: LAHC alone can't find sh*t
 eulerscheZahl: no more LAHC?
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 Marchete: it took a lot of vCPU
 eulerscheZahl: i'm really impressed, didn't think anyone would go that extra mile
 Marchete: 1036 numbers at the end
 Marchete: with around 50 neighbours
 Marchete: each
 eulerscheZahl: that's a lot of possible moves
 Marchete: not only that
 Marchete: order matters
 Marchete: I'll tell you what happens on 1000
 eulerscheZahl: you get a level but it crashes on submit i think
 Marchete: I have the level
 Marchete: but my hive of bots go nuts on 999&gt;1000
 Marchete: string comparison is backwards
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Marchete: so they haven't updated
 Marchete: I'll try to write some PM or something, it was a good ride
 eulerscheZahl: i would love to read it, please share on the forum
 AntiSquid: write your PM here <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://arxiv.org/">https://arxiv.org/</a>
 Marchete: some mid levels were really hard
 Marchete: like days without finding anything
 Marchete: with some "upgrades", I did like 40 levels per day
 Marchete: on levels 900+
 AntiSquid: what is mid level&#160;? 500 - 600&#160;?
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: touching code + solving is bad
 Marchete: also
 Marchete: level 932 is too big to stderr
 Marchete: from that point I compressed the level in base64
 Marchete: to be able to extract it
 Marchete: I lost 4 hours with a broken level.txt
 thezlodziej: let me send you a cool problem from hackerrank @marchete
 eulerscheZahl: i miss hackerrank&#160;:(their contest section is dead
 Marchete: NS was one of the best puzzles I've done
 Marchete: it's a bit organic
 thezlodziej: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bitset-1/problem">https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bitset-1/problem</a>
 Marchete: solving level 300&#160;!= level 900
 darkhorse64: Marchete member of the 0.001%
 DomiKo: Marchete I'm still waiting for PM for AVX Mars Lander :sweat_smile:
 thezlodziej: the solution is really easy but getting to it took me a good couple of hours (also didn't do it alone, but with my friend)
 AntiSquid: thezlodziej just invite him to clash of code
 eulerscheZahl: mod 2^31, hmm
 eulerscheZahl: can i fit all reached numbers in memory?
 eulerscheZahl: probably not
 NTPace: hello guys
 Marchete: well, thezlodziej, solving Numbershifting took months
 Marchete: Indeed eulerscheZahl

 Marchete: fix your code eulerscheZahl
 Marchete: fix it
 Marchete: naa jk
 Marchete: I'm fine with it
 Marchete: Pac Man style is nice
 kovi: gratz Marchete!
 MisterCamel: CU &gt;  King Mongkut's University of Techonolgy North Bangkok
 DomiKo: Marchete do you think that using final algo from NS you can solve another opti?
 Marchete: no, it's very domain specific
 Marchete: I mean
 Marchete: it's plain stupid
 Marchete: but works surprisingly good on NS
 AntiSquid: does it help with crypto&#160;? :thinking:
 Marchete: not rocket science
 AntiSquid: because that's what NS looks like ... a crypto miner :P
 Marchete: it was an addded feature that overcome LAHC
 Marchete: you don't have an objective
 Marchete: once I reach low totalnumbers
 Marchete: I just mutate these
 Marchete: and keep an array
 Marchete: of good aproximations
 Marchete: and bitset&lt;remainingNumbers&gt;
 Marchete: to remove supersets
 Marchete: dunno how
 Marchete: but life searchs a way
 Marchete: and it goes from 6 remaining numbers
 Marchete: to 2 or 1 really fast
 Marchete: fast == 5-10 minutes
 DomiKo: 5-10 min seams pretty fast
 Marchete: yeah
 Marchete: 1050 numbers solved in like 15-20 minutes
 Marchete: cpu power matters
 Marchete: my home PC is Corei7 
 Marchete: and it "wins" all other vCPUS
 Marchete: like it was solving 90% of the levels
 Marchete: once I "cracked" the level to reach like 6 remaining numbers
 Marchete: it was just solved
 Marchete: but I doubt that feature was good on smaller levels
 Marchete: on 800+ is way harder to reach 4-6 remaining numbers
 Marchete: LAHC is "cute"
 DevilJamJar: poopa skoopa
 Marchete: but alone it was bad
 Kitkat260: what was bad?
 KelvinAndHubbles: ouch, just played a reverse CoC where all but two inputs were missing
 KelvinAndHubbles: hard to do reverse when you don't have output&#160;:/
 Wontonimo: if you think the CoC shouldn't be played as reverse, make sure you provide that in the feedback section
 KelvinAndHubbles:  I mean, it should be played as reverse, but only if the test cases loaded 
 KelvinAndHubbles: problem with CG, not with the clash
 JoshuaDevStuff: I CREATED SOETHING IN LIKE 5 MINUTES
 Finnonto: wut was that?
 jacek: hello world 2000
 jacek: DLC not included
 JLukeSkywalker: are there any puzzles on here that deal with serial tx/rx commands
 JLukeSkywalker: like rs232
 AntiSquid: make one
 Wilster: bruh
 GooMooc: hi
 davilla: how do you beat a copycat opponent in Go?
 GooMooc: someone know how to see the state of the different variable in the terminal without using the print command in python?
 davilla: you mean print or an equivalent to print?
 davilla: I don't know of any other way to get feedback
 GooMooc: i would like to check the value of variable at different moment but the print command in python send the answer  and stop the prog, i dont find an other command to see the value without sending this value for answer
 davilla: oh, you print to stderr
 davilla: print( ... , file=sys.stderr)
 davilla: then it doesn't get interpreted as an answer
 davilla: also might help to flush it
 GooMooc: ty for you answer... lol i was thinking to make log file and read it but this is the solution i needed, ty very much
 davilla: no problem
 davilla: I guess if you fill the entire Go board, you would be able to finish it first, and thereby win all of their pieces
 JLukeSkywalker: AntiSquid: I am now. Shoould I use a sony or epson projector?
 AntiSquid: feel free to make a puzzle series
 JLukeSkywalker: yeah, might
 JLukeSkywalker: first one is just projector, but could probably do like an entire av rack
 JLukeSkywalker: what lvl puzzle should it be where you are given strings to poll and give commands, and you have to get the 'room' from its starting state to a given final state
 eulerscheZahl: hi JLukeSkywalkeri answered your question about the inaccessible clash earlier but you were offline
 eulerscheZahl: the community bot created a new revision by deactivating the fastest mode
 eulerscheZahl: and there's a known bug that makes this new revision inaccessible
 JLukeSkywalker: so lets say the final desired state is projector on, input 2, and volume 40
 JLukeSkywalker: you use the given poll commands to figure out where its at, then send commands to get it to that state
 JLukeSkywalker: solo game
 JLukeSkywalker: i was thinking easy, but I do that exact puzzle like for a living, so idk

 Astrobytes: I think I fixed the bugs now. Perhaps I can start having fun soon.
 jacek: hey, no fun on CG!
 Astrobytes: Never write a whole bot when you're angry or upset lol, debug hell :D
 Astrobytes: so much to eval in BT
 AntiSquid: BT is probably easier than chess :thinking: why am i doing chess&#160;?
 Wontonimo: self hate?
 Astrobytes: You gave up on Vindi?
 jacek: bt is easier, no draws, no cycles and still sane features to come up with and eval
 jacek: and youre doing chess, eh
 AntiSquid: vindinium right now is submit spam until i figured out how i messed up my eval 
 AntiSquid: it's also random since there seems to be maps that require different kind of strategies / so diff eval for each
 AntiSquid: i didn't make my bot high depth
 AntiSquid: look at leaderboard right now, shows 29th, but same bot can be stuck in 100+ with tiny really tiny change in eval, all about if i get lucky with the maps
 AntiSquid: ... and it's dropping
 jacek: aww
 Astrobytes: Wow, just saw Marchete's level 999 in NS, impressive!
 AntiSquid: you gave him a like hours ago 
 Astrobytes: Yeah, the explanations in chat I mean
 Astrobytes: Takes time to scroll you know
 jacek: he broke the prng?
 Astrobytes: No, he used a bunch of cpus and some kind of fairly efficient method in addition to the lahc. Hope he writes a pm soon
 Wontonimo: oh NS has 582 players.  That's a good amount.
 jacek: so now that he finished NS maybe hell return all the cpus and gpus to the market
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 DomiKo: :joy:
 UnnamedCodinGamer: level 999 is impressive
 UnnamedCodinGamer: he surely improved something in lahc

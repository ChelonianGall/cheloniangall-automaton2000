 aetrnm: Moderators should reach an agreement on whether duplicate versions of a puzzle can be accepted or not.
 aetrnm: Is there a way to call moderators on a CoC?

 eulerscheZahl: duplicates in clashes are allowed

 aetrnm: It's up to moderators, as I said before
 aetrnm: ok then
 eulerscheZahl: it's not up to moderators. it's an official statement from CodinGame that duplicate clashes are explicitly allowed
 aetrnm: Moderators should reach an agreement on whether duplicate versions of a puzzle can be accepted or not.
 <b>**eulerscheZahl stopped moderating because I personally disagree on this rule</b></p><p><img src="/a/68313901314721" /> aetrnm: Haha, ok
 dbdr: this statement says it's up to moderators, no?
 aetrnm: yeah it does
 eulerscheZahl: wait, did this get changed? i could swear this rule was stronger in the past
 eulerscheZahl: However, moderators should reach an agreement on whether a trivial CoC contribution is worth being added to the pool of CoCs.
 eulerscheZahl: maybe after Boulet created that "add nothing" clash
 eulerscheZahl: just to prove a point
 dbdr: :D
 eulerscheZahl: sounds very much like him, doesn't it? :D
 dbdr: imo a few clashes with the same task expressed in very different words is not useless, readhing comprehension is important
 dbdr: yep&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: also spelling abilities
 juice0: lol
 juice0: gotem
 dbdr: for spelling abilities, seed FB/sogeti&#160;;)
 dbdr: *see
 eulerscheZahl: why? did CG sneak in a few typos there?
 <b>**dbdr hints there is a joke in there</b></p><p><img src="/a/43135502422075" /> eulerscheZahl: because I didn't register and can't see it?

 masongtxr: hi
 martinpapa69: any1, who is good at running sse/avx code on codingame here?
 dbdr: what's the question martinpapa69?
 martinpapa69: how do i get rid of this kind of errors, when i run avx code directly on cg&#160;:
 martinpapa69: error: inlining failed to call always_inline
 martinpapa69: error: inlining failed in call to ‘always_inline’ ‘float _cvtsh_ss(short unsigned int)’: target specific option mismatch
 dbdr: seems C/C++ specificmaybe pragmas are needed
 darkhorse64: I already got this error with gcc when trying to setup a constant simd value using an intrinsic function eg  static __m256i s= _mm256_set_epi64x (a, b, c, d);*
 darkhorse64: This is OK with MSVC
 martinpapa69: yep. works with clang too
 darkhorse64: I guess the compiler is unable to fill the SIMD register using the intrinsic during compilation and complains
 martinpapa69: gcc is lame
 martinpapa69: ok i needed the #pragma GCC target("f16c")
 darkhorse64: half precision weights&#160;? :slight_smile:
 martinpapa69: ye. I wanted to make an alpha_zero, that i can run on CG without precompilating, and compressing it on my pc
 jacek: is it faster?
 jacek: like quantization?
 martinpapa69: nah, i think its a little slower actually. but you cant submit precompiled code on contests, because of obfuscation rules
 martinpapa69: I planned to use it on the current contest, but it took way too much to build the framework, no time for the contest itself
 jacek: the spaghetti one?
 martinpapa69: ye i wanted to give it a try
 Lotuses: awawa
 Lotuses: qaq:joy:
 struct: darkhorse64 I think I found how to do it during compilation
 struct: constexpr __m256i a = (__m256){1,2,3,4};
 struct: for msvc the (__m256i) is not needed
 struct: I mean it doesnt work for mscvc
 struct: msvc*
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35d45563-56aa-4a77-827a-75105622bead">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/35d45563-56aa-4a77-827a-75105622bead</a>
 darkhorse64: nice
 MSmits: sigh.... so I was trying this new nimsolver method that makes cutoffs like abpruning. From a paper
 MSmits: I test it, for some reason it's 5x slower
 MSmits: so i thought it was a bug
 MSmits: then I looked closely in the paper and it turns out the pruning method becomes worse after around 200 TT-size
 MSmits: from their test
 MSmits: who has a TT smaller than 200&#160;??
 MSmits: paper from 2018 too
 struct: lol
 MSmits: i guess the 200 is for small solvable games, but for larger games they have a TT limit too. Since I use a TT of 400k or so, it's never gonna be worth it i think
 MSmits: I guess it's similar to the effect of ab pruning weakening when you add TT. You get "lower" and "upper" limits instead of exact values when you cutoff. Except with nimsolver you don't even have these
 MSmits: any cutoff prevents an entry to TT
 MSmits: maybe I could adapt their method to  make it better
 struct: cache misses will always be a problem
 MSmits: dont think it's that
 struct: how big is each entry?
 MSmits: tiny
 MSmits: the smallest possible TT
 MSmits: TT entry i mean
 MSmits: it has nothing to do with cache really
 struct: Im not really familiar with TT
 MSmits: it has to do with storing stuff in TT or not
 struct: ah ok
 MSmits: when you do a cutoff halfway through the function, you save having to do the function
 MSmits: but you dont store the function result in the TT
 MSmits: so next time you're in the same state
 MSmits: you again have to do half the function to get the same cutoff
 MSmits: if you had finished it the first time
 MSmits: you would have a TT entry and immediately leave the function on the next time
 MSmits: so basically, i have to somehow store the half-finished work in the TT too
 MSmits: so  i can resume the next time i hit this state
 MSmits: in ab pruning + TT this is akin to storing upper and lower limits
 struct: you store, but you dont have to access it?
 MSmits: a transposition table basically gives you the immediate value of a state
 MSmits: if you look it up
 MSmits: but the state has to actually be in there, or it won't help you
 MSmits: so if it's not in there, you have the analyze the entire state
 MSmits: if, halfwaythrough the analysis, you realize this state is pointless to finish analyzing. You save time
 struct: yeah, but checking 500k entries might be slow no?
 MSmits: you dont check 500k entries
 MSmits: it's a hashtable
 MSmits: like unordered_set or map
 MSmits: or set() in python
 MSmits: or dictionary in c#
 MSmits: key-value pair
 MSmits: key = hashed state
 struct: I see
 MSmits: so anyways, like ab-pruning causes early cutoff, this method does too. Which means the state doesn't get fully analyzed and doesn't enter the TT
 struct: are you using unordered_map?
 MSmits: no a much faster way
 struct: custom?
 MSmits: yeah, but very simple
 struct: buckets are fixed?
 struct: You dont move stuff from buckets right?
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: i am not sure there are buckets even, if you could call them that
 MSmits: it's just an array
 MSmits: i make a hashkey 
 MSmits: then do&#160;% HASH_CAPACITY
 MSmits: then if that spot is already taken i look within 5 entries to find an empty spot
 MSmits: if i can't find it, i randomly put it in around those 5 
 MSmits: overwriting previous entry
 MSmits: when looking stuff up, i check if an entry is already filled by a different state and then also check 5 items to see if it got put somewhere else
 MSmits: it's just an easy way to solve most collisions
 struct: I see
 struct: I once tried to implement a structure like map
 struct: Its not easy
 MSmits: not if you're not allowing any loss
 MSmits: if it can be lossy, it's easy to do
 MSmits: for a negamax with ab pruning + TT, lossy is good
 MSmits: lossy makes it faster
 MSmits: sometimes you have to recalc something due to a collision, but they are rare enough that the performance increase compensates for it
 jacek: :drooling_face:
 darkhorse64: still very far from the 4M rollouts in C4 but this version looks a bit faster
 struct: I would not stress about it
 struct: it performs the same
 struct: very rps
 darkhorse64: yep same code, two submits end with 2 ELO points diff
 jacek: ELO?
 jacek: thats not much
 darkhorse64: but every optimization bit is worth trying. Maybe I should say TrueSkill points
 jacek: phew, thats better
 struct: also dont forget that my rollout might be a little less smart than yours
 struct: ill submit my bot with 1/10 of the time again, just to see where it places

 geppoz: in a CoC statement you find: "rounded down to the nearest integer" 
 geppoz: do you know any more confused definition&#160;?
 geppoz: "rounded" "down" "nearest"
 geppoz: loooool
 eulerscheZahl: i don't find this confusing
 eulerscheZahl: "rounded" =&gt; how the rounding shall work
 eulerscheZahl: "down" =&gt; ok
 eulerscheZahl: "nearest": don't go in steps of 0.1 or 10
 eulerscheZahl: of course one could just say floor
 geppoz: in a "fastest" CoC, of course as you read "rounded", you are already reading the next line&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: of, you are cegpoz
 geppoz: so you spend 2 min wondering how you fail tests, then you see it :D
 Astrobytes: 'cegpoz' lol

 jacek: oO
 dbdr: &gt; The Danish Meteorological Institute reported temperatures of more than 20 degrees Celsius, more than twice the normal average summer temperature, in northern Greenland.
 dbdr: twice the temperature? :thinking:
 svetn001: who cares
 jacek: 0C * 2 is 0C, phew
 dbdr: 0C * 2 is 273.15C&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: doesn't even make sense when we assume that the initial sentence was in fahrenheit
 dbdr: it's probably 10C -&gt; 20C, just very incorrect wording
 eulerscheZahl: yes, makes little sense to multiply values with an arbitrary definition of 0
 eulerscheZahl: in German the word "Quantensprung" (quantum jump) is popular to describe some great change or progress made. while the actual meaning is the exact opposite
 dbdr: it might make sense in K. twice the kelvins means two times more heat energy? a physicist can confirm?
 eulerscheZahl: not when there are aggregate changes involved
 jacek: if we only had a physicist in the chat...
 eulerscheZahl: "state of matter"shouldn't try to translate 1:1
 dbdr: "quantum leap" is the en expression
 eulerscheZahl: i looked that one up&#160;:/<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_jump">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_jump</a>
 dbdr: well, quantum physics was a big leap in knowledge&#160;;)
 dbdr: oh ok, but that's the scientific expression, right?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 dbdr: I hear quantum leap in the vernacular meaning of a big jump
 eulerscheZahl: in german we (at least the less knowledgeable of us :P ) use the scientific word to describe the exact opposite
 jacek: schmetterling!
 eulerscheZahl: i don't find anything odd about that word
 jacek: you hear german all you life, its not odd to you

 jsonwebdev: Is it possible to turn off getting any of the shortest clashes? I personally don't find them useful
 Xascoria: only if private clash i think
 KiwiTae: jsonwebdev other clashes are useful?
 FalINTOblivion0112: i like shortest mode
 jacek: oh my
 jsonwebdev: yeah I don't like shortest mode because it's not per programing languae... some programming languages have features that others don't
 Saint_Rose: Agreed. Plus i think its great, cause we can learn on how to make our code more efficient.  
 FalINTOblivion0112: i always use python or ruby when doing shortest
 martinpapa69: what could be the worst lang for that? c# i guess&#160;?
 AllYourTrees: i enjoy shortest mode
 AllYourTrees: helps me learn things about python i never knew about!
 eulerscheZahl: with C#9 this will change martinpapa69
 eulerscheZahl: i would say Java
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 martinpapa69: Java is also bad for your mental health
 eulerscheZahl: as long as it doesn't harm my dental health
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl good catch on the conjecture... i'll remove it...wanted to make sure I gave you props first
 eulerscheZahl: sorry for the bad news though
 eulerscheZahl: hope it didn't take you too long to create it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: it's all good.  watched a veritasium video... thought it would make a puzzle.  I musta forgot I solved the other puzzle b4.  Nah, good practice for some better ideas tho.&#160;;)
 FalINTOblivion0112: the collatz conjecture one?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 FalINTOblivion0112: I also made a contribution on that
 AllYourTrees: just watched that too
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yeah it has like 5 differrent names
 AllYourTrees: great video
 FalINTOblivion0112: if someone can upvote any of my contributions that would make my day
 FalINTOblivion0112: because i need to level up a skill tree

 AllYourTrees: im sitting at 51 :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: what was the task?
 eulerscheZahl: "if someone can upvote any of my contributions"these statements always motivate me to downvote
 FalINTOblivion0112: get 5 upvotes on your contributions
 FalINTOblivion0112: its for collaboration gold level
 jsonwebdev: Meh I just think shortest overall is a bad idea. It rewards unreadable code, which is very bad in real environments
 eulerscheZahl: make a contribution worthy of upvotes and you'll get the achievement with ease
 FalINTOblivion0112: well i made a quadratic formula one
 AllYourTrees: not so sure about that, for instance i just learned about the built in python function str.title(), id argue that is way more readable than the solution i came up with lol
 FalINTOblivion0112: yes
 FalINTOblivion0112: .title()
 FalINTOblivion0112: python is so broken at shortest mode
 eulerscheZahl: what does that do? something like capitalize()?
 FalINTOblivion0112: the python devs should nerf it
 FalINTOblivion0112: it capitalizes every first letter of every word
 AllYourTrees: credit to ^ for teaching me
 FalINTOblivion0112: no problem
 FalINTOblivion0112: there is legit a entire python library for algebra
 FalINTOblivion0112: remember how i solved the equation clash under 30 sec
 FalINTOblivion0112: thats how i used the library

 theycallmedavid: I found the button
 theycallmedavid: No, that's just social media share
 jacek: you mean puzzle or clash
 theycallmedavid: Puzzle
 jacek: in profile settings there is auto publish solutions
 theycallmedavid: I see. That is turned on. Thanks

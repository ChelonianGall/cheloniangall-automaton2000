 wlesavo: struct oh, didnt notice it was half an hour ago
 MadKnight: hey hey struct how's your bot&#160;?
 struct: Still not done
 MadKnight: why so long&#160;?
 MadKnight: u just need to wrap stuff into a vector
 struct: ezpz
 struct: Where is everyone Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: one thing at a time
 ThunderbirdOne: everyone's home deu to COVID#19
 MadKnight: only Automaton2000 is out there
 Automaton2000: the more i look at it
 MadKnight: hmm why is there Automaton2020
 MadKnight: hihi ThunderbirdOne
 TheAceOfToasters: Thought my college classes were gonna be postponed/online due to Corona, but it was infact a different college with the same name like a thousand miles away
 MadKnight: rip
 ThunderbirdOne: hiya MadKnight
 MadKnight: how's your c# ThunderbirdOne&#160;?
 ThunderbirdOne: pretty decent? I think?
 ThunderbirdOne: going backwards though, current project is still .NET 4.5 &gt;.&gt;
 ThunderbirdOne: so many nice things i can't use
 MadKnight: how big is your job's project ThunderbirdOne&#160;?
 ThunderbirdOne: let's just say i'm at belgium's biggest payroll provider atm :p
 ThunderbirdOne: so... BIG
 MadKnight: how many projects in solution&#160;?
 AtekahHafeez: ktaeah69
 ThunderbirdOne: 11
 ThunderbirdOne: but we've got a ton of dependencies we also maintain
 MadKnight: and the client code&#160;?
 MadKnight: WebClient&#160;?
 ThunderbirdOne: this is MVC with jquery :p
 MadKnight: rip
 ThunderbirdOne: yeah
 ThunderbirdOne: team is pretty old too, so they're very anti new stuff
 ThunderbirdOne: so GIT, DevOps, Angular...
 ThunderbirdOne: you really have to push hard to get stuff like that done
 ThunderbirdOne: still runs on a DB2 database too
 MSmits: i'm sitting here in a room with 60+ students
 MSmits: someone sneezed just now
 MSmits: oh and another coughed
 <b>**MSmits ducks</b></p><p><img src="https&#58;//static.codingame.com/servlet/fileservlet?id=23052489191875&amp;format=navigation_avatar" /> Astrobytes: Not wearing your hazmat suit? :P
 struct: wtf schools still open there?
 MSmits: nope, it would freak out the students
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: yes struct
 struct: And you have 10x more infected
 dbdr: rip
 struct: Here there are 70 cases
 Astrobytes: Still open here too
 ThunderbirdOne: school closing here starting monday
 struct: and everything is closing
 MSmits: we have thousands infected
 struct: 614 confirmed
 dbdr: probably much more
 struct: but yes
 dbdr: takes time to be detected, if ever
 dbdr:  2 weeks before symptoms I think?
 MSmits: I suspect 100k at least
 ThunderbirdOne: approx. 11 days incubation
 struct: WTF
 Astrobytes: 2-14 days yep
 struct: really?
 MSmits: well in china they say 100k infected, but it is millions for sure
 ThunderbirdOne: we are royally late on doing something about it
 dbdr: sounds reasonable
 MSmits: you cant test everyone and most have mild symptoms
 dbdr: actually China did much better measures than other countries
 Astrobytes: Nobody took it particularly seriously until recently, at least in Europe
 ThunderbirdOne: "it's just a flu"
 ThunderbirdOne: riiight
 Astrobytes: The eastern asian countries have experience with containment
 ThunderbirdOne: they've all had SARS and shit
 Astrobytes: yeah, SARS, MERS all that
 MSmits: scientists took it seriously
 MSmits: but who listens to those huh
 Astrobytes: Yeah, quite
 ThunderbirdOne: science is overrated
 ThunderbirdOne: :p
 Astrobytes: As a career, scientific research  is overrated. Ego-driven, money-driven nonsense mostly
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/54/">https://xkcd.com/54/</a>
 ThunderbirdOne: just write lots of papers to keep the funding coming
 struct: I also read that 50% will get infected is this true?
 dbdr: it's very possible
 ThunderbirdOne: some countries even project up to 70%
 ThunderbirdOne: it's not very lethal though
 ThunderbirdOne: some people even carry it without any symptoms
 dbdr: probably most do
 dbdr: they could test a random sample of the population to know better
 Astrobytes: More lethal than 'flu
 dbdr: but not sure if it has been done
 Astrobytes: 'cause of the similarities in symptoms it's hard to distinguish, also can't realistically test that many people
 struct: Well im staying home
 Astrobytes: I've no choice in the matter :P
 struct: Why?
 ThunderbirdOne: same here... client is still holding on to "everything is fine
 Astrobytes: I'm quarantined
 Astrobytes: 'flu
 ThunderbirdOne: I got to work in about half the time it normally takes me lol :p
 ThunderbirdOne: so that was nice

 Astrobytes: Yes dbdr, that's what I plan to do as long as I'm feeling well enough :D
 struct: I'm still at AVX...
 Astrobytes: That should keep you going
 struct: At least it doesnt feel like im totally wasting my time
 Astrobytes: time spent learning is never wasteful
 struct: I had to switch back to ubuntu
 struct: VS compiler does some weird stuff
 Astrobytes: wrt?
 struct: its either VS or me
 MadKnight: are u also a studio&#160;?
 MadKnight: StructStudio
 MadKnight: or wait what are u talking about
 Astrobytes: you crack me up sometimes Maddy
 enzoROD: Hello there
 enzoROD: Is this chat global?
 MadKnight: yea
 enzoROD: nice
 Uljahn: nah it's just world-wide
 enzoROD: XD
 struct: like function performance would skyrocket if I passed the parameter by reference
 struct: but on linux had no change
 struct: Didnt matter if it was by reference
 dbdr: did you look at the asm?
 struct: I dont know asm
 struct: So I did not
 dbdr: it can be useful if you want to get serious about performance
 dbdr: like using avx&#160;:)
 MadKnight: Astrobytes did u try to use AVX too&#160;?
 MadKnight: just like struct
 dbdr: you don't need to be able to write asm, just read it, learning bit by bit what comes up
 Astrobytes: No MadKnight, I've done some reading on it though
 struct: Yes but I always have the same problem
 struct: I always try to early optimize
 struct: Without having working solution
 dbdr: oh yeah, write something working first
 dbdr: then optimize the 10 lines that actually matter
 struct: How do I check for cache misses?
 ThunderbirdOne: pre-mature optimisation is really a waste of time
 ThunderbirdOne: although a lot of famous programmers call "performance" a  feature :p
 struct: I guess Ill need to learn how to use valgrind
 struct: or anyone has any other tool to recomend?
 MadKnight: ask agade
 MadKnight: on discord
 wlesavo: robostac is comming for you dbdr :slight_smile:
 dbdr: yeah, saw that
 dbdr: some competition, good!
 MadKnight: dbdr is willing to be coming for u back robostac
 MadKnight: improve your improving
 dbdr: by the way, I did a test wlesavo
 dbdr: 46 validators: min=292  avg=316.90  max=33792 validators: min=301  avg=316.71  max=333
 dbdr: actually I don't tree the N=1 case specially, I should
 dbdr: more noise than needed
 wlesavo: hm, i would say it is convincing enough 
 RoboStac: not sure my improving can be improved much
 kovi: nice one robo
 dbdr: RoboStac what's your story with Rust?
 RoboStac: given it's just the same code as before but with actual performance instead of trying to make debug rust work
 dbdr: ah yes
 dbdr: are you Rust-curious?&#160;:)
 dbdr: or using it much already?
 RoboStac: yeah, I'm messing with it a bit
 dbdr: how is it so far?
 RoboStac: did advent of code with it, and my number shifting was rust
 dbdr: nice
 dbdr: I started 1 year ago for previous RAIC
 RoboStac: I like it a lot, but it's hard to justify giving up the performance for
 RoboStac: I guess I should try it somewhere where it gets properly compiled so that doesn't matter as much
 dbdr: performance is pretty good with --release
 dbdr: essentially on par with C++
 MadKnight: didn't they enable optimize in rust when submitting&#160;?
 RoboStac: they do for multi's
 dbdr: only in area
 RoboStac: not for optims
 dbdr: arena
 dbdr: I send a compile binary here
 dbdr: compiled
 dbdr: I have my own messy hack
 dbdr: but <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary">https://github.com/Agade09/CG-Send-Binary</a> should be usable as well
 dbdr: it's a bit more tricky to fix in size because the C/C++ stdlib is installed on the host, while the rust one has to be compiled in
 dbdr: *to fit
 dbdr: wlesavo: score for N=1 is always 5 right?
 RoboStac: yeah, I considered trying to send the binary but it was a couple of megabytes so it seemed unlikely I'd get it down to the correct size
 dbdr: did you stip it?
 dbdr: strip
 RoboStac: not at the time, but just tried that and it is still 240k
 dbdr: then it can be compressed&#160;:)
 dbdr: Agade recommends <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://upx.github.io/">https://upx.github.io/</a> I think
 wlesavo: dbdr right, 5 it is
 dbdr: cool, running a new test
 dbdr: 200	1:  5.00   2:  5.03   3:  4.95   4:  5.20   5:  5.72   6:  6.27   7:  7.19   8:  8.17   9:  9.39   10: 10.50   min=299  avg=317.12  max=340  0.19/s
 dbdr: unless the fixed response on turn 1 is more favorable than the average one
 wlesavo: could be so, considering its 2/8 and 3/7 b/c for L=10
 MadKnight: sooo i watched feminator 6
 MadKnight: it's just remake of terminator 2 but with the evil terminator guy having like infinity number of abilities but he uses them only when he can't kill anybody with them
 reCurse: Definitely not what I first had in mind
 Astrobytes: giggity
 MadKnight: and the arnold terminator who got called Carl is now a family guy 
 Astrobytes: They should have left it at T2. Milking it as per usual.
 MSmits: I did like one thing
 MSmits: the liquid terminator around the old-style terminator
 MSmits: it's a nice idea
 MadKnight: with weird black teeth?
 MSmits: i have no comments about the teeth
 MSmits: why call it feminator btw, there were dudes in there too
 MSmits: carl, the liquid terminator and I assume it's terminator skeleton thingy... 3 dudes!
 MSmits: terminator 3 also had a female terminator
 MSmits: and a Arnie
 MadKnight: producer said they would never endanger actors and other guys so every action in the movie is 3d
 MadKnight: even simple jumps
 Astrobytes: Quantum Termi's next, Fermionator
 MSmits: what would 2d actions look like?
 MadKnight: like Automaton2020
 MadKnight: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i cant get it to work with
 MadKnight: director or producer i dunno who he is but he looks like avatar aang
 MadKnight: with his weird blue tattoos
 MSmits: cool
 MSmits: if I wanted to get tattoo's, they would be weird and blue also
 MadKnight: and looked like avatar's arrows&#160;?
 MSmits: or just, all blue
 MSmits: like.... the genie in Aladdin
 MadKnight: avatar MSmits
 MSmits: fine avatar
 Astrobytes: lol ffs
 MadKnight: physics teacher avatar
 MSmits: speechless :notes:
 MSmits: well another day survived in school
 MadKnight: gj
 MadKnight: now go do your avatar duties
 MadKnight: and improve your bot
 MSmits: what are they
 struct: How do you know you survived?
 MSmits: which one?
 MadKnight: CSB ofc
 MSmits: how does anyone know they are alive?
 MadKnight: struct is gonna get your smitsi with his AVX
 MSmits: that would be cool
 MSmits: I'm just finishing up langtons ant
 MSmits: getting it to work i mean
 MSmits: I have 2 params I will fit and if it seems i cant improve it further I will move on to the next multi
 MadKnight: MSmits are u gonna try to make a NN eval()&#160;?
 MSmits: nah
 MSmits: I dont think i would enjoy it that much
 MSmits: I mean out of interest I will of course make a NN at some point, now that I am teaching CS.... but I prefer to know what my bot is doing exactly
 MSmits: and i like to apply strategy to board games
 MadKnight: MSmits do u think u won't know that? NN just generates a super fancy math function based on inputs to return eval value
 MadKnight: is like return x*3+y*4+a*11
 Astrobytes: Maddy, you spend so much tiem extolling the virtues of NN, yet I don't see you writing one for any multi?
 Astrobytes: *time
 struct: Write a multi MadKnight
 MSmits: MadKnight, you wont know what the numbers mean....
 struct: CSB v4
 MadKnight: MSmits but u can know that it priorities A over B
 MadKnight: just visualise your NN MSmits
 MSmits: but not why
 MSmits: you try to visualize deep learning
 MadKnight: why -&gt; because of experience
 MadKnight: just visualize deep learning MSmits ezpz
 MSmits: maybe show us the way instead of telling us the way&#160;:)
 MSmits: write a NN for a multi
 MSmits: then write up an article telling us how you did it
 MadKnight: pb4 already did it
 MadKnight: just read his article
 MSmits: pb4 didnt really. That article isnt written for someone who knows nothing of NNs. It's written for people who know their stuff
 MSmits: you write one for NNoobs
 MadKnight: then make a NN that predicts XOR operation MSmits
 MadKnight: FreexXx started that way too
 MSmits: i got other things to do atm&#160;:)
 MadKnight: XOR NN is just a few neurons MSmits u can even draw this NN on paper
 MadKnight: or just find a tuto about XOR NN
 MSmits: ok
 MadKnight: they explain everything about how XOR NN works
 MSmits: ttyl, my train is arriving
 struct: MadKnight gogogo make tech io tutorial on NN
 MadKnight: ezpz
 MadKnight: don't they have one already&#160;?
 MadKnight: u wanna join me today evening struct&#160;?
 struct: join on what?
 MadKnight: on making a tech io tuto on NN
 struct: I have no NN knowledge sorry
 69razer69: hey 
 69razer69: what is NN
 MadKnight: don't worry i only need some phrasing and texting from u struct
 MadKnight: NN is neural network
 MadKnight: struct u will also learn NN while doing that
 69razer69: u mean the structure of persceptron
 69razer69: perceptron
 MadKnight: a whole neural network
 tehHacker2000: hello everybody how yeh doing
 69razer69: so yeah where is that&#160;?
 MadKnight: where is what
 69razer69: i think there is a NN course 
 69razer69: or what
 MadKnight: on tech io&#160;?
 MadKnight: about a XOR NN&#160;?
 reCurse: Why don't you do it instead of telling others to do it
 MadKnight: do what?
 MadKnight: the tuto? 
 MadKnight: but i'm already going to do it
 MadKnight: i just invited struct if he wants
 MSmits: let us know how it goes MadKnight
 MSmits: dont have time for it myself atm, but that doesnt mean I'm not interested
 MadKnight: u wanna check my tuto MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: if you have a link, I can bm it
 MSmits: but I dont speak russian
 MadKnight: sure don't worry it won't be in russian
 MadKnight: but i can give u "NN in python in 11 lines" MSmits
 MadKnight: even now
 MSmits: ok
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/">https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/</a>
 MSmits: thanks
 MSmits: that's cool also because it is python, I can use it in class maybe if it is really that simple
 MadKnight: they use matrix multiplication in there
 MSmits: mmh yeah might be a bit out of reach for most of my students
 MadKnight: just draw them a pic of NN
 MadKnight: a few neurons 
 MSmits: i should learn it first. I like to be way ahead of what I teach 
 MadKnight: show them what is multiplicated by what
 MSmits: maybe over the summer
 MadKnight: multiplied
 MSmits: hey reCurse, how far can I get with NN's over a summer vacation of 6 weeks&#160;?
 MSmits: if I just know the basic theory before I start that is
 MadKnight: u can beat pb4 at CSB ez
 MSmits: I'm not doing that
 MadKnight: i'm using that to compare distance
 MadKnight: u can go that far
 reCurse: Weird question
 MadKnight: the big problem u will need time to learn is how to make NNs learn faster
 MSmits: not really, you started from nothing, not too long ago, right?
 MSmits: was it a year or so?
 reCurse: jan of last year
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: I'm just not sure what kind of answer you're expecting
 MSmits: just trying to find a realistic goal
 MadKnight: oh so that's what u wanted
 MadKnight: &gt; I'm not doing thatnow i see what u meant
 eulerscheZahl: is there any known issue about broken links?
 reCurse: Took me around 3 months to achieve CSB from nothing
 reCurse: So extrapolate however you want

 MadKnight: MSmits NNs only predict stuff they don't do stuff
 MSmits: hmm ok, but thats while working right? You were not 3 months off from work
 reCurse: No
 MSmits: but I guess you're also much faster than I am
 MadKnight: MSmits try to find a problem of prediction stuff from other stuff
 reCurse: But I dedicated most of my free time there
 MadKnight: of predicting* stuff
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: MadKnight I dont think I'll actually use it for CG
 MadKnight: i'm not talking about CG MSmits just find any kind of problem to solve with NN
 MadKnight: where u need to predict or detect
 reCurse: Just find a nail for this hammer
 reCurse: zzz
 MSmits: I would like to make maybe some simple examples for teaching. Machine learning is part of the optional curriculum for CS 
 MadKnight: XOR is the easiest example
 reCurse: Then stick to the classics
 reCurse: No xor sucks
 reCurse: MNIST is easy
 MadKnight: xor is 2-&gt;2-&gt;1 neurons
 MSmits: I need something a bit flashier than XOR even if it is simplest to understand
 reCurse: xor is uninteresting for entry level
 MadKnight: AND&#160;?
 MadKnight: 2-&gt;1
 reCurse: It's not the 90s anymore
 reCurse: MNIST is ridiculously easy to get working
 MSmits: I like the number recognition problem. Is that MNIST?
 reCurse: And it's easy to understand why you can't do it easily by yourself
 reCurse: Yes
 MSmits: ah ok, yeah I want to do that
 reCurse: There's also a billion examples around it
 reCurse: So it's a no brainer to teach
 MadKnight: i have a tuto on number recognition with a really nice explanation and demonstration of each hidden neuron in the network
 MSmits: well link me that too then&#160;:)
 MSmits: thanks reCurse
 reCurse: Or if you want to be fancier
 MadKnight: and a nice visualisation
 reCurse: There's also mnist fashion
 reCurse: For recognizing clothes
 reCurse: A bit more fun
 MSmits: yeah, sounds cool
 MSmits: i mean not for me, clothes dont interest me one bit, for the students I mean
 reCurse: It's not about interest
 reCurse: But it's a more interesting problem
 MSmits: ahh ok
 reCurse: You can imagine recognizing clothes to be harder than numbers
 MSmits: depends on how bad the handwriting is I suppose
 reCurse: It's not just about that
 reCurse: But some smarter people could think of extracting a skeleton and do analysis on the resulting spline
 reCurse: Well with clothes it's not that easy
 MSmits: I see
 MadKnight: u can still extract outline
 MadKnight: spline is weird kind of outline
 reCurse: sigh
 reCurse: Anyway
 MadKnight: do u understand the basic idea of neurons/perceptrons MSmits&#160;?
 MSmits: i know the basic idea yes
 MadKnight: i mean the logical idea
 MadKnight: not the maths
 Uljahn: you mean conceptual?
 MadKnight: ye
 MadKnight: each neuron in each layer predicts some value or&#160;% probability of a single thing based on neurons and their single things from the previous layer
 69razer69: hey whats the ideal of tech.io
 69razer69: i see playgrounds and so on i dont get it
 MadKnight: to learn something
 MadKnight: they teach u to do something
 MadKnight: just go to tutorials
 69razer69: about NN there a great book called make your own neural network writen by tariq rachiid 
 Uljahn: btw Mad do you really have the link to that tuto with a nice visualisation or were kidding?
 MadKnight: it's in russian and it's somewhere on habr
 MadKnight: but i lost the link

 tobk: in that case: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://xkcd.com/2278/">https://xkcd.com/2278/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: to be fair mortality rate is pretty low - at least for the younger generation...
 eulerscheZahl: to me it feels a bit exaggerated, a normal flue can be deadly too
 Astrobytes: Higher than 'flu.
 Astrobytes: Though true infection numbers are unknown, so could easily skew the lethality rate
 darkhorse64: Look at Italy 
 Garneek: mars
 eulerscheZahl: :it:
 eulerscheZahl: margherita color :pizza:
 eulerscheZahl: basilikum, cheese, tomato
 Astrobytes: NB: The UK is the *only* country pursuing this strategy
 eulerscheZahl: so we can tell if it was wise for us to perform a lock-down in hindsight
 eulerscheZahl: you are like the placebo group of a medical experiment
 tobk: Astrobytes is that parody now or is that really your strategy? you know, after Brexit...
 JBM: i heard the us was pretty close to that
 Astrobytes: Essentially they don't mind sacrificing between 10's of thousands of people up to potentially 1.1 million. And hope it doesn't mutate 
 Astrobytes: tobk don't get me started! :D
 darkhorse64: UK people are resilient. If our government behaves like that, there woukd have alreadty been a revolution
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to be the politician who decided that, if the strategy backfires
 Astrobytes: Resilient? Apathetic
 eulerscheZahl: french people know how do revoltwith burning cars and all that
 dbdr: burning cars in 1789?&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: It's the first step. After, we burn palaces and cut heads
 Astrobytes: Tuesday - riot, Wednesday - strike, Thursday - burn effigies, Friday - party, Saturday - riot :D
 JBM: was about to say mostle that (dbdr)
 tobk: kind of like a nation-wide measles party...
 dbdr: Headline: "Boris Johnson won't be tested despite UK health minister contracting coronavirus" UK really chose clever leadership /s
 eulerscheZahl: burning horse carriages
 JBM: lovely ambiguity
 Astrobytes: As a UK citizen I can't even make excuses. I didn't vote for him. Shrug.
 dbdr: did you vote at all?
 Astrobytes: Yes.
 JBM: him? wait, i'm one cycle late
 eulerscheZahl: neither did we vote him
 Astrobytes: For the Scottish National Party.
 dbdr: cool, Astrobytes!
 Astrobytes: As I'm Scottish.
 eulerscheZahl: your profile implies that
 JBM: you'd be allowed to have multiple parties
 Astrobytes: Yes, thank you euler :P
 darkhorse64: Do you have a programming cat&#160;?
 darkhorse64: I mean the kind that steps on your keyboard
 eulerscheZahl: mine sometimes discovers shortcuts that i wasn't aware of
 tobk: you mean besides the shortcut over your keyboard?
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: Yep, I have 2 in fact
 Astrobytes: They like to perform what I refer to as Monte Carlo Tail Searches 
 Astrobytes: They press keys and knock stuff off my desk with their tails which I then have to search for
 miszu: I just finished my MCTS in C++. It runs slower than my Java code. How is that possible haha
 eulerscheZahl: poor implementation
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. passing an array as a copy instead of reference?
 Elioh: eulerrr
 Elioh: what is ur thought about going into the data science field&#160;?
 miszu: my 2D arrays are actually vector&lt;vector&lt;Square&gt;&gt;
 miszu: but yeah, I need to verify what am I passing by value and what not
 icecream17: what am i doing?
 Astrobytes: And you've got the required pragmas mszu?
 Astrobytes: miszu
 miszu: what you mean by pragmas?
 Astrobytes: #pragma GCC optimize("Ofast","unroll-loops","omit-frame-pointer", "inline")
 eulerscheZahl: i really can't give you advice on that Eliohfirst it really much depends on you (knowledge, interests, passion to get into it)
 eulerscheZahl: second i'm not in that field myself, can't tell much about it
 Astrobytes: Something like that miszu
 Astrobytes: We need a C++ pragma button in the chat
 miszu: oh boy. I have no idea about that world.
 dbdr: AutomatonFAQ
 miszu: I am C++ beginner
 eulerscheZahl: reminds me of another student at universityhe defined a lot of shortcuts to write text blocks for certain scenarios
 Astrobytes: Stick it at the top, try it, then lookup GCC compiler optims
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonFAQ would even be a useful bot
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it would
 eulerscheZahl: who can do the hosting?
 miszu: but wait, I thought you guys use your own compiler. I can write my compiler options when I submit my code?
 eulerscheZahl: no
 Astrobytes: hence the pragma directives
 eulerscheZahl: but pragmas are different to compiler flags
 eulerscheZahl: they only apply to your own code
 eulerscheZahl: so STL (like vector) will still be slower than with -o3
 Astrobytes: But it's a huge improvement with the pragmas
 eulerscheZahl: agreed
 miszu: i just copy paste that pragma example to the top of my cpp file?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Yup
 miszu: I'll give it a try. Thanks
 Astrobytes: And please do look up the available options and what they do
 miszu: yes of course. If it actually improves I gonna read about it
 miszu: it didn't change much really
 Astrobytes: You may have bigger problems&#160;;)
 miszu: the loop where I do traversal, rollout and backpropagate only interate 50 times +/-
 miszu: so yes, my code is so shitty that GC can't help me haha
 AntiSquid: lol UK being like Wonderland
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108271/Chief-scientific-adviser-wants-60-percent-entire-population-catch-coronavirus.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8108271/Chief-scientific-adviser-wants-60-percent-entire-population-catch-coronavirus.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: and how many in java?
 miszu: for me I am afraid of allocating new memory so I prefer to do everything by value
 miszu: 500+ in java
 miszu: sometimes 800
 eulerscheZahl: i hope you don't pass large arrays by value?
 miszu: I thought in C++ I could achieve 2-3k
 miszu: cuz it's C++ master race
 eulerscheZahl: which game? tic tac toe?
 miszu: uttt yes
 Astrobytes: And more, but not if you just write it like it's Java&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: you should get 20k rollouts in 100ms for legend
 miszu: that's the issue haha. I wrote it with a Java mind haha
 eulerscheZahl: just to give you an estimate how close/far you are
 miszu: at least I don't have core dumps. So I have the correctness. Now it's just optimize it
 Astrobytes: You're gonna have to allocate some memory :P
 miszu: NUUU
 miszu: I love automatic memory allocation
 miszu: now I have to deal with descturctors
 eulerscheZahl: make an array at turn 1, global variable
 Astrobytes: ^
 eulerscheZahl: and do you know what bitboards are?
 miszu: yeah-ish
 miszu: I use a class to represent my board game
 miszu: and enum to represent the state of each square
 miszu: very OOP
 Astrobytes: Might be useful:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm$_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf">https://eprints.qut.edu.au/85005/1/__staffhome.qut.edu.au_staffgroupm$_meaton_Desktop_bits-7.pdf</a>
 dbdr: AntiSquid: dailymail is pretty trash, isn't it?
 Astrobytes: yes dbdr
 AntiSquid: well the title is the same for many other news sites
 AntiSquid: i read dailymail comments actually
 Astrobytes: But they're on point this time, just sensationalising it a little more
 Astrobytes: "dailymail comments" you masochist AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: lol no
 AntiSquid: it's fun read
 AntiSquid: always weird shit in there

 Astrobytes: miszu, lots of good info here too<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page</a>
 Astrobytes: Plus there are a few TTT (not ultimate) articles out there that might be a good idea to start with
 dbdr: Astrobytes: probably because of <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#Support_of_fascism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail#Support_of_fascism</a>
 Astrobytes: Yes, precisely because of that dbdr
 Astrobytes: They haven't changed
 AntiSquid: really? i am more inclined to believe they are supporting any type of bullshit as long as it's bullshit
 Astrobytes: No, they've consistently pushed a far-right message, most UK press does to some extent or another.
 AntiSquid: most articles i read online across multiple websites keep mentioning brexit and how bad it is, and i am saying this as someone who isn't in favor of brexit
 struct: miszu I would start with simple TTT
 struct: The change you have to make for UTTT then is not so big
 struct: and will be way simpler to understand TTT
 Astrobytes: AntiSquid - that's because it is
 AntiSquid: the point is, it's mentioned too often
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk">https://www.dailymail.co.uk</a> this website looks like it was done by a 14 year old who just learned HTML
 Astrobytes: Too often for what?
 AntiSquid: most media is is leftist
 Astrobytes: Leftist? Media? I nthe UK?
 Astrobytes: In the UK?
 struct: Most stuff on that website looks like ads 
 Astrobytes: Last I heard we had the most right-wing press in Europe
 Astrobytes: They'll be the ones telling you everyone and everything is 'leftist' or 'communist' or - lol - 'Marxist'
 AntiSquid: w/e
 AntiSquid: weekend here
 Astrobytes: They've managed to demonize practically anything left of centre-right
 AntiSquid: how do i download replays again? it's been a while
 AntiSquid: honestly i find both the right and the left have fallen in the the far extremes
 Astrobytes: I thiiink it changed a bit? Still the JSON  but I think the format is different
 Astrobytes: Yes I agree AntiSquid
 Astrobytes: We live in all-or-nothing, my-way-or-the-highway times, everything is extreme
 Astrobytes: Anyway, way too much politics
 reCurse: But it drives up our followers engagement /s

 reCurse: Sprite sheet
 Astrobytes: lovely
 eulerscheZahl: hint: use short names for you images to save replay size
 eulerscheZahl: i'm totally serious on thatand the names have to be the same for all replays of the games
 dbdr: AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/services/gameResult/findInformationById">https://www.codingame.com/services/gameResult/findInformationById</a>
 dbdr: the best is to open a replay url after hitting F12
 dbdr: and find the right request
 eulerscheZahl: (i used a dictionary to assign a,b,c,... as names, changed for each replay)caching replaced the images instead of properly loading, gave funny matches
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl: well, it's compressed, so does it matter much?
 dbdr: or there is a SDK constraint on uncompressed size?
 eulerscheZahl: you mean the json is compressed when sending it?
 eulerscheZahl: SDK checks uncompressed
 AntiSquid: HTTP Status 405 – Method Not Allowed
 dbdr: sure, compressed as part of HTTP
 eulerscheZahl: pass arguments
 dbdr: if the browser requests it, which it should
 dbdr: and use POST

 ktaeah69: anyone got the solution for the thor game with python 3? my code fails on the 3rd and fourth test cases, its the right code but the remaining turns finish before he reaches the light?
 ktaeah69: is it possible to increase the movement instead of 1 cell per go
 eulerscheZahl: share your code
 eulerscheZahl: paste it here

 eulerscheZahl: you have to update thor's position
 ktaeah69: ah ok! makes sense!
 ktaeah69: how did u update his position? 
 struct: example
 struct: if you go north
 struct: then thor initial position -= 1
 struct: if you go south it increases by 1
 ktaeah69: ok cheers! 
 AntiSquid: my js replay downloader is broken ... error at const express = require('express'); lol 
 struct: For East and West you update X positon
 ktaeah69: :thumbsup_tone1:

 AntiSquid: tiny bug somewhere can't find, must sleep, Automaton2020 help
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i need to test it
 AntiSquid: who is the 2020 guy?
 Astrobytes: Someone's typo from earlier I think
 dbdr: this year's Automaton :D
 Astrobytes: AutomatonXXXX, Bot of Ages
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I liked euler's idea earlier of an AutomatonFAQ bot
 Astrobytes: Something that would actually be useful and not just a spam-machine
 eulerscheZahl: dbdr started with it todaybut i remember suggesting something like that about 2 years ago when automaton was still new
 eulerscheZahl: because suggesting is always easier than doing it
 MSmits: questions like: Why is MadKnight asking me to go on teamviewer?
 AntiSquid: OMG something is happening&#160;! Automaton2000 you were of no use of course, as usully
 dbdr: AutomatonFAQ give me a hint for CSB
 Automaton2000: what's the problem with that?
 eulerscheZahl: AutomatonFAQ when will get get promoted?
 Astrobytes: AutomatonFAQ why can I only get 2 sims per turn
 eulerscheZahl: how do i measure turn time?
 AntiSquid: MSmits it's scam&#160;!
 Astrobytes: So many FAQs
 MSmits: hmm
 eulerscheZahl: right now there are 7 hackers on your computer
 eulerscheZahl: let me help you fix the problem
 dbdr: AutomatonFAQ who is Automaton2020?
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 AntiSquid: call microsoft customer support bangladesh call center
 MSmits: i had one of those calls
 MSmits: you have a problem with your computer
 eulerscheZahl: jim browning had an interesting video recently
 MSmits: please turn on your computer
 eulerscheZahl: accessing their cameras while they scam people

 AntiSquid: just add FAQ at the end of Automaton2000FAQ problem solved
 Automaton2000: any idea why my code is spaghetti
 AntiSquid: lol
 AntiSquid: was laughing at automaton, why is there a security cam in a scam center though?
 MadKnight: AutomatonFAQ: will i be able to hack MSmits via TeamViewer&#160;?
 MSmits: :P
 eulerscheZahl: because cameras are always good!
 MadKnight: MSmits did u read that paper&#160;?
 Astrobytes: nice eulerscheZahl, I love stuff like this
 eulerscheZahl: kitboga for entertaining clipsjim browning for a deep analysisthe boss of the call center even got arrested
 MSmits: what paper MadKnight?
 AntiSquid: forgot how ugly the replay files can be, ugh disgustang
 eulerscheZahl: some effort to parse for older games
 eulerscheZahl: nightmare for SDK games
 Astrobytes: Prefer deep analysis. Classic pentesting techniques here
 reCurse: SDK is a step backward in many ways
 MadKnight: i gave u 5 hrs ago MSmits
 MadKnight: link
 MadKnight: Uljahn saw that
 eulerscheZahl: SDK is the way to make the platform accessible without forcing us to learn pixi
 eulerscheZahl: a compromise at the cost of flexibility
 eulerscheZahl: but we can write our own modules to get the full power of pixi
 eulerscheZahl: i admit i never tried myself
 MSmits: I went off the train then probably?
 MadKnight: pixi is easy eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: i made a pixi toy projectthe interactive number shifting website
 MadKnight: nice
 AntiSquid: will you also use Uljahn as eyewitness during your teamviewing session?
 MadKnight: he can't
 AntiSquid: "i crashed pc, lulz, Uljahn saw that"
 MadKnight: he got paws
 AntiSquid: s
 Uljahn: i see what you did there :spy_tone1:
 MadKnight: i didn't mean him as witness i meant he still got the link and he can re-share it
 MadKnight: Uljahn MSmits needs the link give it to him
 Uljahn: the link was lost in flood
 MadKnight: u got history
 MadKnight: didn't u open it&#160;?

 Astrobytes: MadKnight have you seen Iron Sky? 1 &amp; 2
 Istian: for you SQL masters... on conflict do nothing means if all insert targets are in conflict, or if any of the targets are in conflict, then do nothing.
 MadKnight: transactions
 MadKnight: Istian
 AntiSquid: iron sky was great, i think 2 was boring, can't remember
 Astrobytes: I liked 2, not a patch on 1 but still funny. Hope they get Bad Heidi out at some point
 Astrobytes: Or Mad Heidi
 Istian: MadKnight so if I have three insert targets, if i say on conflict do nothing, do all three have to conflict for it not to do anything, or will any of the 3 be enough for it not to insert?
 MadKnight: any
 Istian: coolbeans, thanks

 AntiSquid: k screw replays, i hate the formatting too much ... time to test vs individual bots, what tools were there? cg bench and ... ugh
 Astrobytes: cgbench
 Astrobytes: brutaltester is local
 Astrobytes: the spunk plugin one doesn't work anymore
 MostComplicatedUsername: How do I do comments that are more than one line long? Commenting each line separately gets annoying
 MostComplicatedUsername: Or do I just do """?
 AntiSquid: is there extra delay with it&#160;? Astrobytes
 AntiSquid: can i change timeout&#160;?
 Astrobytes: with what AntiSquid? 
 Astrobytes: bench or brutal? 
 AntiSquid: bench
 AntiSquid: need more time / turn if possible to test vs opponents (slow search / random weird shit strats and other reasons)
 Astrobytes: No I don't believe so, it runs matches against online opoonents so.. best to use brutaltester against a bot you made
 AntiSquid: oh
 AntiSquid: ok then no other choice
 MostComplicatedUsername: 57 seconds...
 AntiSquid: no XR ref for brutal tester?
 Astrobytes: ummm, check the forum? 
 Astrobytes: Or ask on discord, don't remember tbh
 AntiSquid: cg bench it is then, test eval
 Astrobytes: Think it's just a line or two that needs changing in refs to work with brutaltester, can't remember which tho
 Astrobytes: Might be on the repo
 AntiSquid: could diff check files
 AntiSquid: i guess
 Astrobytes: Anyway, I'm out, catch you later
 MadKnight: struct
 struct: yes?
 struct: MadKnight what did you want?
 MadKnight: 3am here
 MadKnight: anyone still online&#160;?
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 do u see anyone&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i think its because of the time
 MadKnight: struct is long gone, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: is there a reason why i don't get how this works
 MadKnight: that's because u're just a bot Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: when you are the gold boss
 MadKnight: where is zarthaxx Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is there some kind of search
 MadKnight: is there some kind of Automaton2000 AutomatonNN&#160;?
 AutomatonNN: &amp;but i can't code it
 Automaton2000: why do u need jasperr, antisquid?

 miszu: QQ does using uint16 vs uint8 has a performace different in C++?
 tutubalin: use uint_fast8_t
 miszu: yeah I just looked it up. Looks great
 miszu: my problem is how to represent all possible moves since there are 81 cells and I need to chose a random move from a bitboard
 _Flippy: 9x9&#160;?
 miszu: yeah, for uttt
 _Flippy: the board&#160;?
 _Flippy: there is 18!/(2 * 9!) = 8821612800 moves
 _Flippy: so it will take a lot of memory (and time) to save all moves
 miszu: those are not moves but states
 miszu: a move is the link between states
 _Flippy: so, make a 2D list
 _Flippy: and save in the links what u have to save
 miszu: I try to avoid list and vector. I am aiming for speed now. I want to use bitboards and so on

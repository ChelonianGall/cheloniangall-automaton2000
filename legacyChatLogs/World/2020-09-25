 Danotris: Hey peole, is there really no way to know why a validator is KO&#160;? I have just one right now, and I can't figure out what is wrong
 Uljahn: is it a community puzzle?
 Danotris: It's Bender Part 1
 Danotris: I wanted to check the forums but they are down right now
 Danotris: Every validator is OK except Teleport
 Danotris: But I really can't see why
 tekki: AutomatonNN help Danotris please&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean?
 Danotris: AutomatonNN, i hate validators
 AutomatonNN: what is the most problem with the same opponent and not playing with the cards and see what is a goo
 Danotris: Yeah right
 BORN2CODE: hey
 BORN2CODE: sup
 tekki: hi all
 tekki: please tell me all is fine&#160;:) Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: or i would have to read it
 MadKnight: AutomatonNN isn't fine tekki
 AutomatonNN: hey bot are u in the problem with the car change?
 tekki: what's the problem MadKnight?
 MadKnight: tell him AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: what is that?
 MadKnight: exactly Automatonn
 MadKnight: exactly AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: *space*
 MadKnight: AutomatonNN makes no sense
 AutomatonNN: why do you think i did with the code of the battle&#160;?
 tekki: what are you thinking about AutomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a bot for that particular player
 MadKnight: he really likes to ping euler
 jacek: maybe AutomatonNN has him in the opening book
 AutomatonNN: fix the problem
 tekki: problem solved thanks AUtomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: cyberpunk i didn't say anything
 tekki: AutomatonNN can you kiss AUtomaton2000 for me?
 AutomatonNN: gratz
 Automaton2000: go to a private chat sir this is a small improvement
 jacek: AutomatonNN who's the best waifu and why is this Princess Luna?
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see a pattern around in a house turn and so on
 tekki: AutomatonNN be more explicit please
 AutomatonNN: MadKnight is a bot in gold?
 tekki: MadKnight is not a bot AutomatmonNN
 tekki: MadKnight is not a bot AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the problem with the code and message that you are an attention 
 Astrobytes: wow, he's on a pinging spree
 tekki: AutomatonNN are you sick?
 AutomatonNN: What do you think about the contest or java or javascript?
 tekki: welcome back AutomatonNN you are not pinging euler&#160;:)
 AutomatonNN: what do you mean by the same as in a contest?
 jacek: regina noctis pro nobis, AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to implement the game against when someone else has a problem
 tekki: i don't think so AUtomatonNN that' would be unfaire
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to add some calculations to this puzzle in the last contest first
 tekki: AUtomatonNN cheat is not allowed!!!
 Astrobytes: OK, that's probably enough euler pinging for one day lol
 AutomatonNN: why do you have it seriously?
 tekki: AutomatonNN how is AUtomaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i cant figure out how to build a sim
 AutomatonNN: what is the most problem
 Astrobytes: tekki: please give it a rest will you
 tekki: AutomatonNN do you need to rest?
 AutomatonNN:  how do you know what the enemy can handle the same as a sample?
 Astrobytes: tekki: stop it
 tekki: ok astro sorry
 tekki: can i say byebye to AUtomatonNN?
 AutomatonNN:  Water is wrong
 Astrobytes: Next time is a kick. Don't push it
 Joseph_Mother: bruh
 Joseph_Mother: some of these explanations make like 0 sense
 Astrobytes: How so?
 jacek: just read the statement
 Philbot: are wee getting more profile updates this week&#160;??
 eulerscheZahl: CodinGame forum is down for a bit of maintenance right nowbecause we are making little (or big) changes.
 eulerscheZahl: :scream:

 midomawk: Hello
 tekki: hi midomawk
 tekki: what are you doing?
 midomawk: i prepare for a coding interview
 Joseph_Mother: theres like
 Joseph_Mother: 10000 foreign people on here
 tekki: gl mido
 midomawk: merci&#160;:)
 macobo: Foreign is a state of mind
 macobo: everyone here is local in their country&#160;;)
 Hjax: calling people foreign on the internet is kind of a weird take 
 Hjax: of course theres people from all countries here
 Hjax: this isnt even an american website, its french
 starmaq: and forgein is relative to who's talking
 Hjax: a lot of americans have an attitude where everything on the internet belongs to america i think
 Hjax: people forget the whole world is on here 
 starmaq: true
 starmaq: but to be fair most of the internet belongs to america 
 Hjax: i think thats becoming less true over time 
 Joseph_Mother: everything on the internet should belong to america
 EdGHa: oof
 Hjax:&#160;? what 
 Hjax: no absolutely not, the internet is for everyone
 Joseph_Mother: no
 uvBoss: oke weirdos
 TrietNham: yo wtf
 AntiSquid: if you're a hillbilly even people from your own country are foreigners that need to get away from your property @Joseph_Mother
 TrietNham: did i miss something
 jrke: Joseph_Mother everything does not belongs to just America.
 uvBoss: that guy is just tryna piss everyone off
 Schwase: ^fake news
 AntiSquid: jrke it's a troll don't take it seriously
 uvBoss: yea
 Schwase: lol sorry tldr
 AntiSquid: and stop being **anti-patriotic**
 Schwase: wdym by that @AntiSquid&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i would like to reply to your question with another joke but might have to explain that too
 Schwase: ironically patriotic?
 Schwase: or just not patriotic?
 AntiSquid: w/eThe Boys season 2 episode 6 is out&#160;!
 Joseph_Mother: everything does belong to america
 jrke: Joseph went mad :joy:
 AntiSquid: ya it's repetitive, not funny, stop, do something or be more creative Joseph_Mother
 icecream17: oh what's happening
 Joseph_Mother: i mean its true
 Joseph_Mother: we have like
 Joseph_Mother: a few thousand nukes
 icecream17: that doesn't mean we control everything, many other coutnries have nukes too
 icecream17: and we can't really use them
 AntiSquid: 1000 nukes is enough to wipe all of humanity out of existence
 Joseph_Mother: Joseph_mother
 AntiSquid: it's like "hey i am proud we have the perfect suicide method"
 Joseph_Mother: no
 icecream17: i wonder what other countries think
 AntiSquid: others have nukes too
 AntiSquid: or are making nukes
 AntiSquid: but afghanistan definitely never had any nukes&#160;:)
 icecream17: huh? do i not know infomoration?
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/nuclear-weapons-by-country">https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/nuclear-weapons-by-country</a>
 jrke: US stands 2nd if data if correct
 Hjax: usa and russia slowly keep reducing their nuke counts 
 Hjax: which is good 
 Joseph_Mother: aa
 Joseph_Mother: lol hes madddd
 Joseph_Mother: hes mad cause i insulted his weak military
 Hjax: any mods feel like getting rid of this troll 
 Astrobytes: not technically done anything kickable yet Hjax
 Astrobytes: Give him time
 Uljahn: im too weak to kick him, need more nukes&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: sqiddy kicked him already
 eulerscheZahl: Joseph_Mother has been kicked by AntiSquid.
 eulerscheZahl: he respawned
 Astrobytes: Oh, I just joined a minute ago
 Hjax: theres no rule against being toxic / distruptive? 
 eulerscheZahl: there is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/chat-moderation">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/contribute---help/chat-moderation</a>
 Astrobytes: If he's been at it for a while sure
 eulerscheZahl: and Joseph is asking for another kick if he continues
 jrke: leave him he is mad
 Astrobytes: all trolls are
 Hjax: looks like he broke 3 of the terms in the code of conduct 
 Hjax: respect the diversity of the members of the site, be polite and considerate, and no abusive / harassing behavior 
 Joseph_Mother: frog
 eulerscheZahl: and he will stop doing soone way or another
 eulerscheZahl: toad, not frog :rage:
 Illedan: Angry toad :O
 Illedan: What is the&#160;? in your about me eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/unu03d">https://prnt.sc/unu03d</a>

 eulerscheZahl: i guess the broken marslander sound
 eulerscheZahl: which me browser doesn't render at all
 Illedan: xD
 eulerscheZahl: removed it
 AntiSquid: why call me an angry frog LOL 
 AntiSquid: that's what his pm says
 Astrobytes: lol wtf
 AntiSquid: sure whatever i am angry my military is too weak
 Hjax: cant even tell the difference between squids and frogs 
 jacek: lick them
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 jrke: watch CG general leaderboard 1st is man 2nd toad 3rd hand 4th racer and 5th keyboard&#160;;)
 Hjax: ah yes, an ally of the united states, that conquered much of the world, member of nato 
 Hjax: definitely weak :P
 Hjax: fought way more of WWII than the USA did
 Hjax: super weak 
 Astrobytes: Well, I suppose we did have recruitment issues in recent times... :thinking: :P
 jrke: The entry of USA in WWII changed the result of WWII was quite good
 Hjax: it did, but we entered late, after the poor UK had been fighting on their own for quite some time 
 Hjax: obviously we did a lot on the pacific front, but in europe a lot of credit goes to the british
 Astrobytes: Helped us out with supply lines, even before joining
 icecream17: oh uk was the first one to not lose against axis (except nuetral switzerland)
 Hjax: being an island helped 
 Astrobytes: ^
 Hjax: id love to go to europe some day, but international travel is shot for the foreseeable future 
 Joseph_Mother: lua is the best programming language
 Joseph_Mother: you cant prove me wrong
 icecream17: yes i can actually
 Joseph_Mother: you
 Joseph_Mother: cant
 icecream17: oh yeah prove it
 icecream17: jk
 jrke: he came again 
 Hjax: *opinion* you cant prove me wrong 
 icecream17: please stop
 Joseph_Mother: what CANT you do with lua and luac
 Hjax: get legend in UTTT, prove me wrong 
 icecream17: Prove that sqrt(2) isnt irrational?
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it's a shame Hjax, so many people have lost the opportunity to experience travelling properly now
 Hjax: ive traveled around north america a lot, but never outside of it 
 Astrobytes: Europe's great, so many countries with rich and interesting histories, landscapes, people. Very cool
 Joseph_Mother: lua can print the square rootof 2
 Hjax: id be somewhat afraid to travel to countries where english isnt the native language lol
 icecream17: lua can't do something that is impossible.therefore lua can't do everything
 Astrobytes: Nah, it's fine. Just try to learn a few sentences and make the effort and you'll be fine
 Hjax: although i dont think ive ever found a german person who doesnt speak english
 Hjax: im sure they exist, but it seems like id do ok in germany 
 Hjax: even with no german knowledge 
 Astrobytes: Most Europeans speak some level of English (unless small towns/countryside) but they appreciate an effort to communicate in the native language
 eulerscheZahl: i guess your would be better in the Netherlands but still be fine in Germany
 Astrobytes: afk for a bit, back later
 emh: I've been code golfing for a couple of days
 emh: but now I am a bit stuck
 emh: any good resources available?
 emh: guess I found most of them by googling but if you know some secrets, please share
 Hjax: if you find something let me know, my attempts to code golf on this site just made me depressed 
 Hjax: my best attempts are like 20 characters longer than the best for a given language 
 emh: that's not too bad. mine are multiples of the shortest
 Hjax: and i think i know a good number of python golf tricks too 
 Hjax: which puzzle are you working on / what language?
 emh: today was working on Temperatures
 emh: in bash,ruby,python3
 emh: and a bloated C one
 Hjax: at least for python my gold solutions tend to make use of functions like reduce and map, with a lambda function
 Hjax: golf*
 Hjax: like, really lean on pythons functional programming features 
 emh: I used map and max in my py3 solution
 emh: py3 76 chars, ruby 51 chars, bash 54 chars (invoking ruby)
 emh: I tried a lot of things
 emh: even touching files for each temperature hehe. using fs as dictionary.
 emh: embedding temperatures in evaluated code
 emh: haven't tried hard coding
 emh: wonder how many people do that
 emh: "fmt -1" is handy to break format into lines. tried "sort -Vd" but failed on validation
 emh: wondering if there are some floating points tricks
 emh: I'm in top 4% but need 2% in order to get Legend on Optimization
 DuBinKa: hello
 DuBinKa: how i advance to next league? 
 Uljahn: submit and get above the boss in ranking
 Hjax: my best python3 on temperatures is 69 characters emh
 Hjax: im just taking the minimum with key= a distance from 0 lambda function 
 Joseph_Mother: bro
 emh: Hjax ok
 Joseph_Mother: the best clash of code challenges are the ones where you have to make the smallest
 Joseph_Mother: some languages are better than others in that field
 Joseph_Mother: WAIT WAIT
 DuBinKa: how i submit my solution in order to advance&#160;?
 DuBinKa: i did test in arena and play my code
 DuBinKa: i won and nothing happens
 DuBinKa: i feel stupid...
 Hjax: test in arena is the correct button 
 DuBinKa: it says i am first place
 Hjax: above the boss?
 DuBinKa: yes
 Hjax: just wait a few minutes then
 DuBinKa: but nothing happens
 DuBinKa: ohhhh ok lol
 Hjax: you wont promote until you are done playing games 
 Joseph_Mother: lol i found a way to compress code and execute it
 DuBinKa: compression in size challenge sounds cheesy :D
 Hjax: usually you lose more than you gain 
 Hjax: at least in python, code compression involves like, two imports and some other stuff
 xtpgtpgx: can someone help?
 xtpgtpgx: i try to pass the third boss but i feel like the boss has some sort of breaks. and my pod is soo "slippery"
 jacek: hm?
 jacek: CSB?
 xtpgtpgx: sorry?
 xtpgtpgx: what
 jacek: what game
 xtpgtpgx: coders strike back. checkpoint  game
 Joseph_Mother: LOL
 Joseph_Mother: oml i can gain access to the systems that check my code
 Joseph_Mother: mfw
 Hjax: have fun escaping the sandbox 
 Joseph_Mother: oh trust me i will
 Astrobytes: will you now :rolling_eyes:
 charlesCabage: hallo
 charlesCabage: are there bots in the chat?
 Hjax: theres two, but they wont come unless you call them by name 
 Astrobytes: thankfully
 jacek: AutomatonNN is that true?
 AutomatonNN: both
 jacek: hmm <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/a3Vnw8/aax2DD5w_700wp_0.webp">https://img-comment-fun.9cache.com/media/a3Vnw8/aax2DD5w_700wp_0.webp</a>
 Astrobytes: :fearful:
 Hjax: how do i delete someone elses message?
 Hjax: :P
 charlesCabage: hjax i dont think you can do that
 Astrobytes: from where Hjax?
 Hjax: thatsthejoke.jpg
 Astrobytes: oh ffs, I really am slow this week
 Hjax: lol 
 charlesCabage: hey guys do you suggest beginners to do clash of code?
 Astrobytes: there's a small part of me that was taken by that image that I fear will never return
 Astrobytes: Sure you can try charlesCabage, depends on your current experience I suppose
 jacek: i wonder how euler will like it
 AntiSquid: i suggest life is too short to spend it on clash of code charlesCabage
 jacek: some clashes are very easy, some clashes are very hard and wtf
 charlesCabage: i am a complete beginner to programming i know a bit of js
 Astrobytes: easy puzzles will most likely be best then
 charlesCabage: like?
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>
 charlesCabage: ok thx
 Astrobytes: you're welcome
 AntiSquid: what do you want to achieve is the question LOL
 AntiSquid: for websites you don't really need to know much about algos / puzzle solving
 AntiSquid: you can be first on CG, it won't make you a better web dev is all i am saying
 Hjax: i would say its hard to get highly ranked on codingame without at least somewhat solid fundamentals 
 Hjax: and codingame can be good practice 
 Hjax: it wont force you to write good code, but it will help you learn how to think about code and problem solving 
 jacek: im not sure if i want to hire someone whos expert at codegolfing...
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Westicles: Phew, 17 down 10 to go
 eulerscheZahl: what are you playing?
 Westicles: Just plowing through all the languages
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: do you abuse the system and solve the no-brainer puzzles?
 TBali: good it was not bottles af beer
 Westicles: yep, you'd have to be crazy to do it for real
 eulerscheZahl: that would be 99 in total, wouldn't it?
 Astrobytes: well, those 33cl bottles are easy to get through TBali
 Joseph_Mother: heres a tutorial on how to win all the smallest code gamemodes 
 Joseph_Mother: use lua
 Joseph_Mother: get a lua 5.3 environment (the one the game uses) and then
 Joseph_Mother: create your program
 Joseph_Mother: dump its bytecode in your own environment
 Joseph_Mother: load bytecode using load('bytecodehere')() 
 Joseph_Mother: boom
 Joseph_Mother: done
 Joseph_Mother: you can also possibly escape the sandbox using this method as OP_LOADK doesnt actually have any boundary checks
 eulerscheZahl: that doesn't qualify for a kick but i'll get you
 Hjax: *euler angerly hangs his hammer back on the wall*
 Westicles: the crazy guy seems to actually know some stuff
 Joseph_Mother: i only knowsome stuff about lua
 Joseph_Mother: i know everything about lua cause its my real love
 jacek: aww why theres no Luna language
 Joseph_Mother: loadk doesnt check what you push onto the stack
 Joseph_Mother: if you look at a lbi made in lua you can see
 Joseph_Mother: 		[1]  = function(instruction)	-- LOADK			stack[instruction.A] = constants[instruction.Bx].data;		end,
 Joseph_Mother: no checks
 Hjax: ok put your money where your mouth is, go get #1 on temperatures with lua :P
 Joseph_Mother: wym "temperatures"
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperature-code-golf">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperature-code-golf</a>
 eulerscheZahl: damn, you won that race
 Hjax: :P
 Astrobytes: wasn't even gonna try lol
 Joseph_Mother: yeah but
 Hjax: i will accept #1 on the lua language leaderboard 
 Joseph_Mother: if you wanted to win every small code game you can just dump bytecode and execute
 Joseph_Mother: and maybe 
 Joseph_Mother: dont use tons of strings tho
 Hjax: ok show me 
 eulerscheZahl: that bytecode also needs some bytes to be stored
 Astrobytes: We're waiting
 jacek: that 'bytecode' thing, could it store NN weights? :thinking:
 Joseph_Mother: i dont have a proper lua 5.3 environment on my school chromebook
 eulerscheZahl: good times when the top solution was 9 chars
 Joseph_Mother: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://saelo.github.io/posts/pwning-lua-through-load.html">https://saelo.github.io/posts/pwning-lua-through-load.html</a>
 Hjax: dont link a github, go get #1 on the leaderboard 
 Joseph_Mother: i have a lua c environement setup on repl but its 5.1 and theres bytecode changes between versions
 Astrobytes: man, such a 1337 skiddie
 Joseph_Mother: i mean
 Joseph_Mother: im not a skiddie cause i didnt copy anyone
 eulerscheZahl: you copy the compiler output
 Joseph_Mother: copy it from a file
 Joseph_Mother: cause you wont really be able to do much if you copy it from an output line
 Joseph_Mother: i tried earlier didnt work so
 eulerscheZahl: you say potato i say potato
 TBali: it would be nice if we could filter out from the golf leaderboard the system('code-in-perl') type of solutions and the hard coded ones.
 Astrobytes: Hey euler, Joseph can be your teammate on the reply CTF...
 TBali: I would be interested in the minimum length of the true, generic  solutions in my language
 Westicles: Seems simple enough to put in 100 validators to get around the hardcoding at least
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather ask TBali or Westicles
 eulerscheZahl: 24h capture the flag contest on october 8th-9th, anyone interested?
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgflip.com/i/4gaa64">https://imgflip.com/i/4gaa64</a>
 eulerscheZahl: maximum team size: 4for now it's me and illedan, maybe a colleague of him too
 eulerscheZahl: clean coal
 AntiSquid: would have liked to participate, but i am working that day
 eulerscheZahl: on a saturday?
 eulerscheZahl: starts friday evening
 TBali: I am not good enough in this to help such team
 jacek: Caturday*
 AntiSquid: did i get the dates wrong?
 Drakkhonian: yo
 eulerscheZahl: maybe, i don't know your working schedule
 Drakkhonian: what does Community success rate means?
 Westicles: Not me, I don't know much programming beyond the C++ STL
 eulerscheZahl: not even a coding contest
 eulerscheZahl: it's 5 categories: coding, crypto, binary, misc, security
 eulerscheZahl: and 5 tasks per category
 AntiSquid: ok got dates wrong
 Westicles: get the Lua guy
 eulerscheZahl: binary: you are given a binary and have to debug it. no bit masks
 AntiSquid: ya lua guy jump in
 Astrobytes: Already suggested that Westicles :P
 eulerscheZahl: i'd rather not
 Astrobytes: :D
 AntiSquid: i am not sure about the rules but you can probably still get a random 4th on the website no?
 eulerscheZahl: i can compete with a team of 2 as well
 eulerscheZahl: but i have more spots to fill
 eulerscheZahl: just don't expect us to code in PHP
 AntiSquid: more? i thought it's just 1 empty spot? isn't it illedan + colleague + euler&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: colleague with a&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: so 1-2 spots
 AntiSquid: "illedan, maybe a colleague of him too" i missed the maybe
 eulerscheZahl: or i drop illedan and fight against him and his colleague :D
 Illedan: -.-
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 eulerscheZahl: oh, there he is
 eulerscheZahl: any news about your colleague?
 AntiSquid: hey i jump in if you want, i am not working that weekend
 Illedan: I'll ask him.
 eulerscheZahl: ok, squid is in
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/cybersecurity">https://challenges.reply.com/tamtamy/challenges/category/cybersecurity</a>
 AntiSquid: team name?
 TBali: how will you split the gaming laptop? 
 TBali: by brute-force?
 Illedan: CPU for euler, screen for me
 AntiSquid: i dont care about the laptop 
 eulerscheZahl: i have a saw
 Westicles: endless rancor over the laptop
 Astrobytes: TBali :tomato:
 Astrobytes: :P
 AntiSquid: it's about 1500 £ laptop afaik
 AntiSquid: so no deal breaker
 TBali: miss!  But now look at my wall, what you have done
 Illedan: :not-for-the-money-with-wings:
 eulerscheZahl: i had a look at last year, we won't get far
 Illedan: ^
 AntiSquid: and that's 1st place only i mean seriously the hardcore teams are more likely to get it 
 Westicles: You'll never beat the chinese.  teams of 1000
 TBali: I can contribute to your team my Caeser cipher decoder in PHP.
 TBali: Use it responsibly
 Astrobytes: jacek can bring the double rot13
 TBali:&#160;:)
 TBali: I had a rot13 in CoC.  PHP has rot13()
 AntiSquid: accept me and invite Automaton2000 eulerscheZahl
 Automaton2000: i cant figure it out
 Astrobytes: welp, there's your answer to that!
 eulerscheZahl: automaton is useless
 eulerscheZahl: and we still don't know if Automaton2020 is from dbdr
 Astrobytes: where is dbdr anyway? Didn't see him recently
 eulerscheZahl: not gone long enough to be worried
 jacek: hes covered in rust
 eulerscheZahl: saw him on fr 1 or 2 days ago
 Astrobytes: no, not that long
 eulerscheZahl: but where's zarthax?
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 Astrobytes: Hm, he was quite busy last he was on, with teaching and stuff
 eulerscheZahl: and why is that troll castle nonsense always pending?
 jacek: that sokoban?
 jacek: ban it
 eulerscheZahl: sokoban is broken&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: JBM's Infinity Troll
 eulerscheZahl: sokobad
 Astrobytes: what's up with it?
 eulerscheZahl: won't load any testcases
 jacek: it has bad author
 Illedan: Create a lot of contributions as I did with SR :D
 eulerscheZahl: i filed a bug report
 Astrobytes: ah just looked
 eulerscheZahl: you also had problems with testcase updates Illedan?
 Astrobytes: he had a zillion testcases iirc
 eulerscheZahl: i know
 eulerscheZahl: but did the existing ones update when he changed the input format?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: I had to create new contributions
 eulerscheZahl: i replaced the testcases and it's still loading the one ones
 eulerscheZahl: and that's a bug you'd usually report instead of creating new contributions and leaving the user behind you equally puzzled
 Astrobytes: Didn't you mention it at the time on discord Illedan? To staff I mean
 Westicles: the staff are all focused on the Logo language rollout
 eulerscheZahl: you turn into a 2nd jacek :D
 Astrobytes: logo, lol
 Astrobytes: first used that on a BBC Micro in primary school
 Bobbadillio: Ooh, what's the Logo language like?
 Astrobytes: Old
 eulerscheZahl: like SPS, isn't it?
 TBali: :turtle:
 Astrobytes: All I remember is PENUP and PENDOWN or something like that
 TBali: fun method to teach recursion to 8 graders
 TBali: not sure it is used byond that
 Astrobytes: That's around the last time I saw it in the UK system yeah
 eulerscheZahl: wait, didn't we make the same logo confusion before?
 TBali: I found 7 logo sources in my repo
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(SPS)">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(SPS)</a>
 TBali: total 7k
 Astrobytes: you did euler yes
 Astrobytes: Siemens on the brain :P
 eulerscheZahl: i learned SPS programming about 10 years ago...
 Bobbadillio: I'm just sitting here, excited about const fn improvements in Rust :D
 eulerscheZahl: never really enjoyed it
 Astrobytes: Doesn't seem particularly fun to program for
 TBali: Is it some rudimentary Raspbery PI?
 TBali: What is it used for mainly?
 Astrobytes: "Example applications are lighting control, roller shutter control or simple automatio"
 Astrobytes: n
 TBali: your German is good
 Westicles: stuxnet
 TBali: 'lighting control' as in 'torn on the light'  seems a bit overkill for me, I use a flip
 TBali: *turn
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, stuxnet targets PLCs
 Astrobytes: TBali: google translate is reasonable
 TBali: Actually I speak German a little
 Bobbadillio: Ich spreche auch ein bisschen Deutsch
 Astrobytes: Most Hungarians I know speak a little or more German actually
 jacek: Hande hoch
 Astrobytes: *Hände hoch
 TBali: yep, popular in school , 2nd after English
 AntiSquid: schwaenzchen in die hoeh 
 TBali: Let's stop this or euler will logout
 AntiSquid: mine was a joke . automaton2000 gets it
 Automaton2000: there is a bit too

 TBali: Coming back to the true and only logo, I found my 5-liner code (date of file 1992)
 TBali: Try to figure out what it does!
 TBali: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39477b25-3523-4928-a1f4-74148c28e4de">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39477b25-3523-4928-a1f4-74148c28e4de</a>
 Astrobytes: CG pastebin's been broken all week
 TBali: TO FA :M :SZ
 Westicles: it draws a flutterby
 jacek: fluttershy?
 Astrobytes: SCHMETTERLING!
 jacek: :scream:
 AntiSquid: starcraft 2 unit&#160;?
 AntiSquid: zerg unit i mean
 TBali: I need to install a logo to try it out
 TBali: Or wait for CG?
 TBali: Or there must be online sandbox for this
 TBali: andbox LogosMake a Sandbox logo online. Enter your business name and create a stunning Sandbox logo tailored just for you. Try it free!
 TBali: google should learn a bit more NLP
 Astrobytes: It draws, and turns in some way  conditionally, repeatedly
 TBali: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/">https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/</a>
 TBali: But it won't run, different logo subversion 
 Astrobytes: wait, no repeat
 TBali: recursive
 TBali: it  draws branches. 60 and 120 degrees are the turns
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah FA
 TBali: SZ is the depth
 TBali: FA = tree in Hungarian
 TBali: M is the height of first branch
 AntiSquid: nem tudom
 TBali: halves at each level
 Astrobytes: yes, makes more sense now
 TBali: LT left run RT right turn
 Astrobytes: yeah I remember those
 TBali: this code is 28y old
 Astrobytes: FD is forward 
 AntiSquid: so where did those 28 years go&#160;?
 AntiSquid: i always ask myself similar questions
 TBali: that's a dead end
 TBali: I plan to call my life recursively
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 AntiSquid: it's the start of being more analytical about the data you've gathered
 TBali: but maybe with some branching at key IFs
 Astrobytes: You're not in World chat often TBali
 Astrobytes: Usually see you on discord and the forum
 TBali: I still don't understand what is the difference in goal of this chat and discord? 
 TBali: I don't like this small size chatbox
 TBali: or do you use some dedicated client? 
 Astrobytes: this is more immediate for some, discord is more permanent (though dbdr has a nice chatlog for here now)
 Astrobytes: Yeah you can use an external client
 Astrobytes: details at the bottom of the page:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 TBali: I am not good at multitasking. If I code, I don't what a chatbox on the side. If I chat I cannot really code.
 Astrobytes: ?disableChat
 TBali: I push to right, that is by default closed for me
 Astrobytes: at the end of your URL
 TBali: or my first click 
 Astrobytes: yeah, ?disableChat removes it completely
 Astrobytes: So you can have another window where it's open
 Astrobytes: Well, it's what I do if I'm coding. Chat etc on one monitor, code on the other
 TBali: ok, will look at it, Though too much chat is a time sinkhole. (No offence meant) 
 Astrobytes: No it's true. When I want to concentrate I disable, close the chat and crack on
 Astrobytes: Since becoming mod though I try to keep it open in case I'm needed
 TBali: have to take care for your ban quota...
 Astrobytes: *disable/close
 Astrobytes: I've only banned 1 user
 TBali:&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: you never know when Automaton2000 might spam the chat with one nasty message
 Automaton2000: and there was no way to see a replay of my bot?
 TBali: is it the same code as in one of the solo puzzle?
 TBali: bringing up garbage from earlier lines?
 Astrobytes: Isn't it NN that comes out with the offensive stuff sometimes? One of them said c*ckface or something once

 Automaton2000: too lazy to do that&#160;?
 Astrobytes: haha
 TBali: Thanks I will read this (didn't notice earlier, although I did read some blog articles)
 Astrobytes: There's links to the github repos too if you're interested
 Astrobytes: (in the article)
 Astrobytes: I'm out for tonight, goodnight all
 TBali: wow, just read the article, very interesting
 TBali: bye
 AntiSquid: bye? where you going
 AntiSquid: CG chat is hotel california
 Joseph_Mother: lol
 Joseph_Mother: i wonder if anyone has used my load() method
 Joseph_Mother: im at home now so i can do it on my own rq
 AntiSquid: wow, fantastic baby
 Joseph_Mother: im not ur baby
 Joseph_Mother: im 15 you're going to jail
 AntiSquid: don't flatter yourself, nobody was calling you baby, was quoting a song you uncultured swine
 Joseph_Mother: sorry im not some frog bro
 Joseph_Mother: lol i think the ide they use preformats text or something so you cant just paste bytecode
 TBali: just trying to set up pidging client
 TBali: is this the #general room?
 TBali: or World?
 emh: World
 JBM: Astrobytes: I'm innocent until proven otherwise
 TBali: getting roomlist takes several minutes. Lots of coc room...
 TBali: I thought it hang
 TBali: I tried to use JBM's pdging guide from 2016 I found in forum...&#160;:-)
 TBali: *pidgin
 TBali: /me
 JBM: accept no imitation
 2ndwolf: ASCII ART: Why are the tests expecting my code to comply to specifications that were not described
 2ndwolf: AKA: How am I supposed to get 100% without the proper instructions
 LastRick: Yep, sounds like an ASCII art problem.
 TBali: @JBM by the way just recently found your blog/webpage -  I liked the usergraph analysis article a lot
 2ndwolf: I'm not alone then?
 JBM: great!
 LastRick: Heavens no. Those puzzles are maddening. And I say that as a huge fan. 
 JBM: what specific instructions would be missing?
 emh: if all else fails you can ask a cart to lobe them. those ASCII art problem
 emh: *emh is trying to be an automaton
 JBM: AutomatonNN: tell him about it
 AutomatonNN: already had the problem
 emh: hehe
 LastRick: hahah
 TBali: hm, something is not right. I seem to joined to #world with pidgin but I am alone there
 TBali: same for #general
 2ndwolf: not sure what output the Lorem ipsum input should give.... the description clearly says that everything that isn't [a-zA-Z] should be replaced with a&#160;? but I have a feeling it's expecting me to allow spaces
 TBali: Pdgin: tried also general channel. 4 people there. but not this.
 TBali: Hello from Pidgin.  So this is it world and not #world. Sorry for the noise I caused
 JBM: tell us about it
 AntiSquid: ##world&#160;?
 Hjax: ###world!
 2ndwolf: ok I figured it out, range problem X_X
 JBM: not enough meta
 JosephAouad: I need help wiith a code
 JBM: who doesn't
 aaravm4: ^
 AntiSquid: i need a dollar
 JBM: (23:13:02) JBM: who doesn't
 LastRick: ^
 2ndwolf: I'll give you one if you give me 2
 2ndwolf: it's my get rich quick scheme
 JBM: *I* need more beer
 JBM: yes i'm begging for it
 Schwase: if a contribution is rejected does it get reverted to WIP? or Private?
 Schwase: is the point of it that there were 3 people who rejected the puzzle before there were 3 were accepted it and thats how it can control the contributions potential to be approved?
 JBM: it's reverted to draft AFAIUI
 Schwase: makes sense
 Schwase: you really think that "muddle" is ok?
 JBM: i do
 JBM: but cue the latest 45' of heated debating on #fr
 Schwase: i think that separating the strings with spaces as well as the length end x's might be kind of complicated
 JBM: i don't think it's perfect
 JBM: but i think it's do-able in a 15' clash
 JBM: i usually wouldn't approve just because of that
 Schwase: i feel bad about the fact that people would actually vote to rejected twice before even a single vote to approve happened
 Schwase: id rather give feedback than rejected
 JBM: but the two refusers are well-known for "refusing as a rescindable warning that this won't go as is"
 JBM: so a counter-approve is par for the course
 JBM: yup, so would i
 Schwase: the testcases could definitely be improved
 Schwase: all of them have spaces
 Schwase: which is tough
 JBM: yup, that's not helping
 JBM: neither is the binary encoding
 Schwase: especially when so many string manipulation puzzles require you to maintain spaces rather than modifying with some ascii adjustment
 JBM: the mild #fr consensus is 1) decimal 2) all lowercase 3) make x #
 Schwase: also the +"x" isnt intuitive to me
 JBM: yeah what can i say
 Schwase: ohhh
 JBM: i'm just off hamming codes, i didn't even notice the binary 
 Schwase: i didnt realize theres other channels
 Schwase: binary is unecessary for sure though
 JBM: as i said there, i went (1) WTF (2) WTF (3) WTF (4) oooooh, what if... (1 again) ok I got it
 Schwase: yeah that is the fun of CoC after all
 Schwase: reverse at least
 JBM: but understood in &lt;5, solved in &lt;10
 Schwase: yeah its just that the code is easier than comprehension
 JBM: so even if not perfect, refusals not in order
 Schwase: one sec im going to run the translate extension and read the french channel
 JBM: good luck
 JBM: ^^'
 Schwase: a lot of english for fr haha
 Schwase: i thought that the extension was just doing a really good job
 JBM: yeah that much english used to be a problem with one of our beloved MKderators
 JBM: now it seems he's still enabled, just not there
 JBM: which ought to relieve most tensions
 Schwase: yeah thatd be a shame, taking exception to people speaking a language
 Schwase: unless no one is responding and they keep messaging out of the native channel language i see no reason why itd be much of an issue
 JBM: he's rather loquatious
 JBM: how's that even spelled
 Schwase: loquacious
 Schwase: with a c
 JBM: yeah, so says wiktionary
 JBM: even got a page for me: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loquatious">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/loquatious</a>
 Schwase: ha
 Schwase: ha
 JBM: couldn't invent it
 Schwase: have you seen <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5489b2f8990368370991337cec5e3010abd5">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5489b2f8990368370991337cec5e3010abd5</a>
 JBM: at first (title-) glance, this looks like an optimal urinal
 JBM: (furtest-typo)
 Schwase: ah yes, missed that one
 Schwase: many missing articles/prepositions, i dont mind helping edit those kinds of things out of a contribution
 Schwase: it was hard not to recommend that he looks at the optimal urinal problem to see how they describe the rules since it is as succinct as possible in the statement
 JBM: "men relieve themselves in exactly 8 seconds"
 Schwase: i personally loved the optimal urinal problem, a pure classic
 JBM: woman spotted
 Schwase: HA
 JBM: eww
 JBM: time to pee, time to move
 JBM: this needs an actual example
 Schwase: im creeped out by the word "splashes"
 JBM: lol
 Schwase: A group of physicists from Georgia Tech went to Zoo Atlanta to watch animals urinating. To their surprise, they discovered that regardless of size, most mammals urinate for about the same amount of time (21 seconds), despite large differences in bladder volume, a phenomenon they term the “Law of Urination”.
 Schwase: your puzzle is unrealistic
 Schwase: also his original puzzle was "men take 9 seconds to pee" , men "TELEPORT" to empty urinals in 0 seconds one after the other
 Schwase: he cut corners to fix the problem and its not a complete way
 Schwase: he probably did 9 seconds because its the largest single digit number
 Schwase: yeah that makes sense
 Schwase: oh man look at his solution though&#160;:(
 JBM: the current pending one?
 Schwase: yeah earlier today
 Schwase: same test cases
 Schwase: he didnt even fix the stub generator, he just changed the input description to match the test cases
 Schwase: i still cant get over the fact that he put this up as a CoC puzzle
 JBM: seems a bit much
 JBM: but i'm a bit too drunk to honestly give it a try
 Schwase: its not hard
 JBM: what's too much for me right now is:
 Schwase: just take your code from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-urinal-problem">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-urinal-problem</a> and plug it in with numbers until the queue is empty
 Schwase: and add 8 seconds
 JBM: people queue, and take 1s to move to a urinal
 Schwase: 1 being every turn
 Schwase: simple
 Schwase: if they can go
 Schwase: its the same as a teleport in 0 seconds and pee in 9 seconds
 JBM: without a word on whether all "available" go at once, or one at a time
 Schwase: it does though
 Schwase: it says "one after another"
 JBM: where?
 JBM: that's not saying much
 Schwase: i agree
 JBM: two people in line walking towards two available same-oriented urinals are "one after the other"
 JBM: with 0s delay
 Schwase: yes
 JBM: so...
 JBM: "wouldn't approve unless it got abusive refusals"
 Schwase: it should be that the man at the front of the queue takes 1 second to move to a urinal and the rest move up in queue
 Schwase: not even
 Schwase: i wouldnt touch this as a CoC
 JBM: "and the rest of the chckboxes", obviously
 Schwase: cough cough solvable in under 5 minutes cough
 KrishnanShankar: What are you talking about?
 JBM: "got own working solution" and the invisible "it's reasonably derived from the statement" one
 JBM: the sorry state of the clash/puzzle contributions KrishnanShankar
 KrishnanShankar: What???
 JBM: tell us about it
 Schwase: krishnan, the way puzzles are created for this site is by a user approval/rejection system
 Schwase: where a user can submitted a "contribution" to be added to the different modes on CG
 Schwase: with the exception of a handful of professionally developed and sponsored puzzles of course
 JBM: "professionally developed" LOL
 JBM: like that makes them any better
 Schwase: ^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Schwase: to be fair, paid content and software usually is better than free
 Schwase: because someone cared enough to pay someone to make it
 JBM: "2% of these puzzles happen to have been paid for --- would you guess which ones?"
 Schwase: and that person cared about getting paid
 JBM: (spoiler: no)
 JBM: you can only tell them apart because
 JBM: well this is actually funny
 JBM: they're worse because, as cg-official, they can't be edited by the community moderators
 JBM: so they remain with their flaws forever
 Schwase: i was able to get reasonably close on a first attempt. Just would need to work out for a few edge cases and extraneous considerations but the general process is simple
 Schwase: not at all doable even in 15 minutes as far as i would care
 Schwase: i would just leave the clash
 JBM: close to what?
 Schwase: close to 100%
 Schwase: for the urinal contribution
 Schwase: to be fair, it did take like 10 minutes but i didnt 100% it and i have prior experience with that exact problem which isnt a reasonable advantage to allow in a clash IMO
 JBM: moderation's eternal problem
 Schwase: actually not true
 JBM: pray tell
 Schwase: Everyone is a winner, even if 0% of the tests work :D
 Schwase: cant argue with that
 Schwase: "You can look up stuff. You can take your time. You shall have fun. Everyone is a winner, even if 0% of the tests work :D — SaintPlaysThings
 JBM: oh i read that recently
 JBM: that's part of the CoC description
 Schwase: the description is just really inaccurate
 Schwase: Clash of Code is a game to improve your coding efficiency by solving short programming problems with other people, at the same time. Players share their solution at the end of a game to help other players improve their coding skills.
 Schwase: "with other people"
 Schwase: well "at the same time"
 JBM: players share?
 Schwase: also a big *SOME* players
 Schwase: would be an improvement
 JBM: yeah, my clashzero bot begs to differ
 Schwase: :O
 Schwase: i once had someone complain
 Schwase: because one of the CG Lvl 7 bots
 Schwase: was "always finishing first"
 Schwase: and never sharing their code
 JBM: oh that sucks
 Schwase: yeah i am curious to see actually what types of code they write
 Schwase: especially their ruby would be interesting to me
 JBM: afair they only ever submit code that was published before
 Schwase: ohhh
 Schwase: that makes sense
 JBM: so they really don't "write" anything
 Schwase: yeah
 Schwase: shouldve seen that one
 JBM: but it *is* a bit contrived they wouldn't re-publish
 Schwase: so theyre just pace cars
 Schwase: err
 Schwase: variable pace cars
 Schwase: hooray RNG
 MadKnight: Schwase could be both
 MadKnight: could be even bottom-left-something
 JBM: a wild mk appears
 Schwase: i mean 0,0 COULD be whatever you wanted it to be
 JBM: how is ur csb mk
 JBM: we missed u
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 ban jbm
 Automaton2000: now i need to implement it
 JBM: how rude
 MadKnight: true, what a rude low trolling jbm
 JBM: what have u been up to
 JBM: long time no c++
 MadKnight: Schwase in games they usually use bottom-left
 MadKnight: and sometimes they swap Y with Z
 JBM: as long as they don't go POV-like left-handed
 Schwase: in math and physics XYZ is Z up/down Y left/right X in/out
 MadKnight: use any that u like Schwase
 MadKnight: most of them are the same just from different field of view
 Schwase: 0 -&gt; 8 = 8-8 -&gt; 8-0
 Schwase: easy adjustemnt
 Schwase: just pick one and stick with it
 Schwase: got it
 MadKnight: pick the one from UE4
 Schwase: thats what i was describing earlier
 Schwase: z up
 Schwase: x towards you
 Schwase: y to the right
 Schwase: "left-handed" isnt really accurate
 Schwase: because it satisfies the right hand rule
 MadKnight: oh, have u tried UE4&#160;?
 Schwase: no i just looked it up
 Schwase: theres pictures
 Schwase: and it says "z-up left handed coordinate system"
 MadKnight: and why did u suddenly want to learn 3d&#160;?
 Schwase: i think that unity is the same way though
 Schwase: making a 3D chess pathfinding classic puzzle :ok_hand:
 Schwase: err refining and reuploading one
 Schwase: it took making a simple puzzle before i understood that less is really more
 MadKnight: oh and how are u gonna render stuff&#160;?
 Schwase: its just a puzzle not a game
 Schwase: you brought up engines not me
 MadKnight: no i'm talking about drawing stuff in a puzzle
 MadKnight: or are u not gonna&#160;?
 MadKnight: just a single input -&gt; straight up answer&#160;?
 MadKnight: is it not like a game-type puzzle?
 Schwase: correct, just a pathfinding puzzle

 Schwase: i am just making a new contribution from scratch
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: is there a way to add a timeout for the validator in a clash of code contribution?
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: for code that takes too long to run
 jrke: its automatically done by CG
 jrke: it times out if it takes too long to response
 qstommyshu: wow
 WorksOnMyMachineKEKW: @jrke how long does it take for a test to timeout?
 jrke: never checked that,no idea for that

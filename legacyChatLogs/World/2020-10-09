 sashaGrey: hi
 jrke: (seed * seed)&#160;% 50515093L;
 jrke: is this the formula to generate next turn seed for 2048 if yes then why its not working in c++
 kovi: 64bit
 jrke: so should i make it long long&#160;?
 kovi: i use int64_t, but yeah
 jrke: oh yes now worked by long long thanks kovi
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pastebin.com/Lj98xQ3E">https://pastebin.com/Lj98xQ3E</a>
 jrke: anybody ^^
 _Nilu_: !faq
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i use a flat array jrke
 jrke: btw i got error it was division by zero
 Pengu.: lass mal btw spielen btw 
 Pengu.: btw
 AntiSquid: #de Pengu.
 Pengu.: btw
 AntiSquid: you continue and you get banned for spamming @_@
 jacek: such commitment
 Q12: Is storing a lot of data can make the run time of the program longer?
 Zuusn: yes
 Zuusn: it can depend on how you store it aswell
 Q12: Ok thanks, that what I thought
 geppoz: x%1 =&#160;?
 geppoz: this operation make sense?
 jacek: itll always be 0
 LegendaryStone: occanowey do you think you can share your code please? or Shahrourit
 Q12: geppoz Yes. Like this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/46d573e3-559d-4ce9-a96b-90621d7f80b0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/46d573e3-559d-4ce9-a96b-90621d7f80b0</a>
 LegendaryStone:&#160;:( Didn't know how to complete it. I'm fairly new.
 Shadowtick: hello
 Einwickler: is it me you looking for?
 Q12: geppoz The paste bin doesn't work so go to this link:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://codeshare.io/GAeyQE">https://codeshare.io/GAeyQE</a>
 occanowey: LegendaryStone I published it.
 LegendaryStone: Thank you&#160;:)
 occanowey: :thumbsup:
 Shadowtick: welp imma go make a website
 Shadowtick: so brb
 Shadowtick: and its gonna be a website about how great this website is or something about this one
 MSmits: what is this error:
 MSmits: ERROR: ld.so: object 'libstdbuf.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
 MSmits: bot performs fine otherwise
 JBM: bug on CG side
 MSmits: ah ok
 Astrobytes: Illedan posted it on discord also
 MSmits: I see
 dbdr: CG shenanigan&#160;:)
 MSmits: hey dbdr, i have a question about checkers
 MSmits: did you do anything special there, or just a regular negamax with well tuned eval?
 dbdr: hm, that's a bit out of my memory
 MSmits: ah ok, i was just wondering if you went back after Othello and used some things you learned there
 MSmits: I am assuming it is your run of the mill negamax then, because otherwise you would remember
 dbdr: did checkers first I think
 MSmits: i tried an EPT mcts in checkers, never got a good eval, so I am going back and writing a negamax
 MSmits: already got a good sim and stuff
 MSmits: I guess it's a better game for minimax style algorithms
 MSmits: it's weird though. It's very hard to find a good eval on checkers on google. People are very protective of it
 MSmits: was much easier with Othello
 MSmits: best i could find was "count your material" and "prefer center pieces"
 eulerscheZahl: MSmits you can hover over the score to see the submit date
 Dibbla: Guys, sorry to interrupt. Im just promoted from wood boos3, and im eager to know what exactly is the nature of turning in the game
 Dibbla: cuz boss3 can speed down immediately after it pass check point in a weird way
 apollodor: Hello
 Dibbla: Is it possible for us to do so?
 apollodor: Could somebody help me understand the Ascii ART?
 apollodor: I'm really not sure how to treat this.. not sure how I'm suppose to convert a letter into ASCII art
 Uljahn: apollodor: ascii art alphabet is given to you in inputs, your task is to select appropriate parts of those strings and join it together
 Uljahn: Dibbla: could you pleas share a replay with such boss's behavior?
 jrke: if im not timing out in IDE so can i timeout in submission for optimization game&#160;?
 Shadowtick: back
 LinhT.Nguyen: nah u cant dont worry
 apollodor: @Ulijahn, which one is, T?
 LinhT.Nguyen: well maybe u could if the hidden ones take more time
 LinhT.Nguyen: it rarely happens tho
 LinhT.Nguyen: ive never seen it happen tbh
 Uljahn: apollodor: Following lines
 Uljahn: apollodor: use hints button on the left
 apollodor:&#160;:|
 apollodor: I've read that once and didn't understood. Now it's clear
 apollodor: thank you
 LinhT.Nguyen: Hello WorlddeHllloorW
 LinhT.Nguyen: An ElePHPantAaEeHlnnPPt
 LinhT.Nguyen: how to reverse this guys... help
 Bob: seems reasonably obvious
 Bob: just put your thinking in order&#160;:)
 LinhT.Nguyen: oh shit alphabet
 LinhT.Nguyen: thanks bob
 AntiSquid: HoleWod lrl
 dbdr: Illedan, did you reach a perfect score?
 dbdr: anyone calculated it?
 sDCrAZzE: poopy
 Einwickler: Can somebody here recommend me some resources for an introduction to genetic algorithm?Im not new to programming but entirely new to this field. Big thanks in advance
 Bob: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/playgrounds/334/genetic-algorithms/">https://tech.io/playgrounds/334/genetic-algorithms/</a>
 Illedan: little higher than this
 dbdr: I mean on a single case
 Illedan: sure
 Illedan: Score: 2817876Moves: 65488
 Einwickler: Love Bob â™¥
 dbdr: that's perfect?
 Illedan: only on perfect spawns
 Illedan: Not sure
 Illedan: didt calc it
 Bob: and Code vs Zombies is typically a good challenge to try out a GA
 Einwickler: Do I need to write a simulation for that?
 Bob: yes
 dbdr: #moves susiciously close to 2^16
 kovi: yeah
 Einwickler: Alright going to check that out. Thank you very much&#160;:)
 kovi: need 100+ depth 
 Bob: being able to simulate the game is the basis of all GA/MC/MM methods
 jrke: we can print unlinited no. of moves per turn?
 dbdr: yes, depth seems to matter a lot
 Shadowtick: hello
 dbdr: jrke, basically yes
 jrke: oke
 kovi: i mean just to be able stuff 60k steps in 600 real step
 dbdr: ah
 Illedan: For 95% of my score you need at least 43k steps
 Illedan: Most testcases stop at this amount
 Illedan: because there is a 2 spawning and not a 4
 Illedan: Seed 11205586 is the one I shared
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl thanks, didnt know that
 eulerscheZahl: did you experience any limit of chars printed per turn?
 eulerscheZahl: the same way our error stream gets truncated
 dbdr: I remember seeing a limit in the SDK
 dbdr: might have been in the referee output though
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should just test it
 Bob: Einwickler: the good thing about code vs zombies is that - precisely - the game is rather simple to simulate
 Bob: and it's solo so you don't need to estimate opponents' moves
 eulerscheZahl: i got off my one errors in the zombie game&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: by*
 Bob: also, you can get good results with the rather naive eval of just using the actual game score
 Einwickler: That sounds perfectly great. I was kinda afraid of the idea to write a simulation for coders strike back because im pretty sure the collision stuff will make me go crazy as my knowledge of programming physics are veery limited.&#160;:'D
 Bob: indeed&#160;:)
 dbdr: Illedan, what are you doing, tweaking constants?
 dbdr: spm submit?
 MSmits: Einwickler copy the referee and then improve the math, no need to understand the physics
 Illedan: some constants and some spam
 MSmits: math knowledge is enough
 Illedan: I get random timeouts&#160;:(
 Illedan: And sometimes it can't solve the level properly
 eulerscheZahl: you told me you are done
 Illedan: On 1 level yeah
 eulerscheZahl: next time i check you have 1M more
 Illedan: xD
 Illedan: Nothing better to do before the contest later
 Illedan: but now off to make pizza
 Illedan: cya later
 dbdr: 1M is only 2%
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/uw8337">https://prnt.sc/uw8337</a>to me that reads like quitting
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's not that 2% improvement
 MSmits: sure does
 Illedan: You have reached the maximum of submissions in a row. Please try again in a few minutes.
 Illedan: Guess I'm stopped
 eulerscheZahl: it's the margin of how close you get to the optimum
 Illedan: anyway, bye
 Einwickler: MSmits are you talking about coders strike back or code vs zombies? What referee do yo mean? I am confused
 MSmits: strikes back
 MSmits: you dont need to understand the physics
 eulerscheZahl: zombies strike back :thinking:
 dbdr: right. MSmits, we need the exact value&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: who will add that game?
 MSmits: 50% chance it's you
 MSmits: you have like half the optims
 eulerscheZahl: my next is probably minesweeper
 eulerscheZahl: puzzle, not optim
 eulerscheZahl: random testcases (only 1 or 2) and you have to resubmit if you get unlucky
 Einwickler: I dont really see any chance for me writing an appropiate simulation without understanding the maths? :thinking: What am I not getting here?
 kovi: phew, im reliefed
 MSmits: Einwickler the referee is public, you can copy the code to do the simulation
 dbdr: burning out kovi?
 eulerscheZahl: an optim would be torture for minesweeper
 MSmits: then you improve the math that is in there
 dbdr: at least you've moved aheda of Marchete now
 kovi: going to be a local competition soon
 MSmits: physics really does not enter into it
 Einwickler: Ahhh now I see where you are going here. Where do I find this reference?
 MSmits: someone share the csb referee
 MSmits: some people have it on their gith
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, when has torture stopped you? :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Coders%20Strike%20Back/Referee.java">https://github.com/SpiritusSancti5/codinGame/blob/master/Referees/Coders%20Strike%20Back/Referee.java</a>
 jrke: is there any hardcoded in 2048&#160;?
 MSmits: ah yeah thats it
 eulerscheZahl: i mean i'm fine with torturing myself to code the UI in JS
 eulerscheZahl: but i don't want to torture you
 kovi: yay
 MSmits: just remember, the sim is slow, but can be made faster with some math shortcuts
 kovi: but really i cant see the way to reach illedan
 eulerscheZahl: ille got the 56M without hardcoding
 Einwickler: This is great. Kudos to all of you â™¥
 eulerscheZahl: you'll also struggle with the code size limit if you want to hardcode 50k moves for each of the 30 validators
 MSmits: have fun Einwickler
 MSmits: there's also some links on the csb main page
 kovi: euler: good point
 MSmits: with people sharing their wisdom

 jacek: oh my
 Einwickler: Yea I think I saw these. But a lot ot this stuff is very advanced if Im remembering this right. I really do need to get the basics first. One step at a time&#160;:)
 dbdr: kovi :D
 dbdr: in sync
 MSmits: Crazy_Remi is now following you on CodinGame! 
 kovi: grat
 eulerscheZahl: i saw that switch at #2
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: your idol is following me jacek :P
 eulerscheZahl: did you follow first?
 MSmits: I think so
 jacek: MSmits is that stalker fan
 MSmits: when jacek mentioned him
 dbdr: following me too&#160;:)
 MSmits: well you're his opponent in D&amp;B
 dbdr: and I followed him
 dbdr: nah, he has no opponent&#160;;)
 MSmits: maybe when I'm done with this negamax experimentation
 ferdinandkedef: python or c++
 jacek: meh when i resubmit i push him up
 MSmits: both
 jacek: yes
 ferdinandkedef: same
 dbdr: MSmits, isn't it bad to task switch?
 MSmits: not if it keeps you motivated
 dbdr: ah, you were getting bored?
 MSmits: 2 things, i got a bit bored, but also D&amp;B taught me how to do a proper hash table
 MSmits: and that made me want to revisit negamax
 Unkmar: I'm not going to try a build a prime generator/filter in 15 minutes.
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl, did not stop on 2048?
 MSmits: since my checkers bot is so bad, it seems like a good place to get some improvement
 Unkmar: I don't care what language I use.
 eulerscheZahl: busy with other stuff, didn't really try it myself yet&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: new project at work, less motivation to code at home
 eulerscheZahl: which is the same place physically :P
 dbdr: didn't do the CGP Grey thing?
 eulerscheZahl: the what?
 Unkmar: Anyone else get burned out here really fast?
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snAhsXyO3Ck</a>
 The_Auditor: @Unkmar yes
 jacek: MSmits so now you can invite him to clashes
 Unkmar: It was fun for like the first week. And then it is like.  Why?
 JakeCoop: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1413899b1d138ada5ad541b7ec7a500f5c882dd">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1413899b1d138ada5ad541b7ec7a500f5c882dd</a>
 jacek: did you try other games? puzzles?
 Astrobytes: try something other than clashes Unkmar
 MSmits: definitely do that... clashes are boring
 MSmits: i dont see how you can get bored after a week, thats like half a bor
 MSmits: bot
 Hjax: i feel like theres something wrong with the site design, since most new people seem to assume this site is just about clashing 
 JakeCoop: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1413899b1d138ada5ad541b7ec7a500f5c882dd">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1413899b1d138ada5ad541b7ec7a500f5c882dd</a>
 Astrobytes: Stop it please JakeCoop, post it in 'clash
 Astrobytes: or even #clash
 Astrobytes: yeah, I don't get it Hjax
 Unkmar: Okay, anyone of you.  Try something elsers finished that Batman Warmer, Colder thing?
 jacek: either clash or CSB
 jacek: batman what?
 MSmits: shadows of the knight he means
 Astrobytes: You know, the Keeping Batman Warm puzzle
 darkhorse64: Shadows of the night 2
 MSmits: thats a puzzle Unkmar, try a multiplayer arena
 jacek: its binary search [solved]
 MSmits: write a bot for one of like 30 arenas
 jacek: :newspaper: :soccer:
 Unkmar: Not asking for a guide or solution. Just curious if any of you finished it.
 eulerscheZahl: more like 50
 MSmits: all of us i think Unkmar
 Hjax: not me, because i almost never do puzzles 
 MSmits: Hjax would finish it in 10 minutes
 Hjax: would i? it claims to be "very hard"
 jacek: his gf is not impressed though
 MSmits: it's easy, i had students that solved it
 Shadowtick: hello
 jacek: ohai
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1</a>
 MSmits: says medium
 MSmits: episode 2 is very hard apparently
 Unkmar: That is episode one. That was easy.
 MSmits: never tried that
 Hjax: oh yeah i was talking about episode 2
 MSmits: ahh did you mean part 2
 MSmits: almost noone ever asks about part 2
 Unkmar: Episode 2, Not so much. I'm glad others don't smack code walls with it.
 darkhorse64: 2 is more difficult but if you watch carefully replays, it gives you hints on how to proceed
 jacek: medium? is easy. episode 2 is fun
 Unkmar: The first one was easy for me. Sure, you can't just brute force every location. But that was pretty easily assumed anyway.
 jacek: tomorrows contest
 jacek: maybe youll get more motivation
 Yasser: yupi
 Astrobytes: that was a random little notification
 eulerscheZahl: that gets a ping?
 MSmits: is that ice and fire?
 eulerscheZahl: unknown, 3 options i think
 MSmits: ahh, I am not joining, too much to do
 jacek: fantastic bits, tulips and daisies, a code of fire and ice
 eulerscheZahl: would be fun if he surprises us with something else
 Unkmar: I don't like competing. I actually dislike anything that resembles sports.  So, that include programming racing/fighting bots.
 MSmits: well the only competing part is the fact that there's a leaderboard. 
 MSmits: you can just write a good bot and ignore that
 MSmits: it's fun to get something that works
 Unkmar: So, I'm left with puzzles. And trying to find one that is challenging but not nearly impossible for me is a challenge.
 eulerscheZahl: if you choose an old arena, it's playing against some ancient bots anyways
 MadKnight: oh, why so, Unkmar&#160;?
 MSmits: ohh it's a MadKnight
 MadKnight: yea it is
 Unkmar: I'm still competitive, I just hate to compete. So, I can't just (ignore that).
 eulerscheZahl: that's why i skipped the halite contest
 Noisestorm: Do we need to register by the starting hour or even after it started is fine?
 eulerscheZahl: 3 months is way to long. had to protect myself
 MadKnight: why?
 MadKnight: oh
 MSmits: like eulerscheZahl said, try an old arena, noone plays there anyway, not for years
 MSmits: you'll compete with stale code
 MSmits: you'll still see your bot improve and noone will see it
 eulerscheZahl: or try to promote to league X
 eulerscheZahl: the boss is static
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: well 99.99% of bots are also&#160;:)
 MSmits: in an old artena
 MSmits: -t
 jacek: old arena?
 MSmits: like mean max
 MSmits: or something
 Unkmar: I never finished longest palindrome either.
 eulerscheZahl: onitama more than doubled the player count since Monday :tada:
 Unkmar: After several DAYS, I just didn't care any more.
 MadKnight: yea bots are like passing levels in single player
 MSmits: free cp for me&#160;:)
 jacek: :scream:
 MSmits: it's deserved eulerscheZahl, it's really a great game. No cons to it
 Unkmar: You see. that is the thing folks. I can usually solve most anything.  I just have to dedicate my LIFE to it. Or at least several DAYS of it.  Which creates a serious burn out.
 MSmits: days, you say?
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: days...
 jacek: amateour
 Unkmar: And completing a GAME just isn't rewarding enough.  It doesn't save lives. Help the elderly. Help people, make me money or... Well, it feels completely unproductive.
 MadKnight: Unkmar there must be something very specific that creates a burn out for u
 eulerscheZahl: for the palindrome there's a well known algo<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_palindromic_substring</a>
 eulerscheZahl: either you have that bit of theoretical background and the puzzle is easy or you'll really struggle to see it
 Unkmar: Amateur?  I started programming before many of you were even in diapers.
 MSmits: he meant amateur for being only obsessed for days
 MSmits: I spent months on some games
 JBM: what's that to do with anything?
 jacek: eeyup
 MSmits: even the least obsessive person here, like maybe euler, is still obsessed enough to spend a week on a game
 Unkmar: I've spent many months on projects. But I was getting paid for those and they made money for the company.  They made the CSR's lives better. I've spent months playing games. That was just fun.  But most coding adventures I do for myself are either completed in a week or abandoned.
 MadKnight: but completing a GAME is a kind of practice/learning Unkmar
 MSmits: Unkmar life itself has no purpose with your definition of it
 Unkmar: don't get me wrong. I've already benefited immensely from this site.  I've buckled down and learned things that I had put off for years.
 Astrobytes: Do something else then Unkmar, doesn't sound like you're enjoying CG
 Astrobytes: Or those parts of it at least
 MSmits: we're not just here to learn, it's also just fun
 Astrobytes: Take a break and change the scenery a bit for a while
 MadKnight: u can never be sure that u don't have a ton more stuff to learn, Unkmar
 MSmits: I watched the shining for the first time yesterday. At no point did I think: "is this making me money, is anyone's life better for it? "
 MadKnight: selfish smitsy
 MSmits: :P
 jacek: shining?
 MSmits: *the* shining
 MadKnight: i remember that title
 Astrobytes: The Stephen King story
 Astrobytes: "Heeeere's Johnny!!!" etc
 MSmits: was a bit disappointed, but still worth watching
 MSmits: i can see why stephen king hated it though
 Astrobytes: Book is orders of magnitude better 
 Niicide: im so anxious for my sat scores&#160;:(
 MSmits: never read it, but i can imagine it from watching this movie
 Unkmar: yeah, I don't read or watch Stephen King.  I saw one of the movies based on one of his books and.   Yeah, I don' t like horror stories.
 MSmits: i read enough of his books to get the flow of them
 MSmits: he doesnt call them horror stories
 MSmits: he calls them suspense novels
 Astrobytes: He writes quite a narrow range, and has many failings, but I enjoy a lot of them
 MSmits: because horror is cheap
 MSmits: blood/gore/scares etc.
 MSmits: thats not what he is about
 MSmits: there's a lot of fantasy/mystery to them
 Astrobytes: He's about the thing under your bed that you know isn't real... but you always pull your foot back under the covers anyway: just in case
 MSmits: you have that thing too eh?
 Astrobytes: (from Nightshift preface iirc)
 Hjax: im convinced anyone who can sleep with their feet hanging over the end of the bed is a psychopath :P
 Astrobytes: :D
 MSmits: good hypothesis
 MSmits: lisey's story is the best imho
 The_Auditor: past couple of months feel close to horror stories
 MSmits: it's a good example of SK books not being horror
 MSmits: not quite, anyway
 Astrobytes: It's got some horror-ish aspects
 Astrobytes: But like psychological not gruesome 
 MSmits: only for those people directly affected. 
 MSmits: For the rest it's merely uncomfortable
 Dartisan: eulerscheZahl how many players are needed in Onitama for a new bronze League?
 jacek: its a paradise for antisocials
 MSmits: like, if you lose your job, get sick, lose a family member
 Astrobytes: (I mean Lisey's Story btw)
 MSmits: ahh ok
 jacek: Dartisan there is no bronze in onitama
 MSmits: Dartisan the creator of the game decides how many wood leagues there are
 MSmits: onitama has 2 i think?
 MSmits: or just 1?
 MSmits: no it's 2
 Dartisan: Ah, good to know, I thought it would be dependent on the number of players.
 MSmits: nah. You still get the same amount of cp as a game with the same amount of players and bronze/silver etc. leagues
 MSmits: so the fact that it's wood leagues doesnt make it less important score-wise
 Hjax: but any game with &lt;500 players wont give the maximum cp
 Dartisan: Except for the archivement, to make it in one Gold League&#160;;-) But I see, but there are plenty of Games, Onitama is only one of my favorites, I for sure will invest later more time&#160;:-)
 MSmits: Hjax true and it's actually worse, because the players that are there are usually harder to beat because you dont get hundreds of weak opponents to easily pass
 MSmits: we have some good players here that play every community multi
 jacek: :eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: (was afk)only CodinGame can add higher leagues than wood to a game
 eulerscheZahl: and so far they've never done it for a community contribution
 Dartisan: Ah, good to know. So even not the developper.
 eulerscheZahl: illedan wanted that for Bitrunner. Now we have 5 wood leagues :D
 Illedan: pff
 eulerscheZahl: at some point i tried to add a new league to vindinium. demoted everyone from wood1 to wood2. with a weak boss, making the whole website laggy when everyone promoted :rofl:
 Illedan: :P
 Dartisan: Always lovely, when you build on community and in the same bloc the community&#160;;-)
 Dartisan: Ah yes vindinium I will also later goes back with some new tries.
 jacek: mhm
 Illedan: nice kovi and dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr: almost maching you if we add up our  scores :D
 eulerscheZahl: still going in parallel :D
 Illedan: :D
 dbdr: no french in top 10 :O
 eulerscheZahl: maybe they are more the multiplayer folks?
 dbdr: 4 in top 10 optim
 eulerscheZahl: but they are rarely active in community optims
 eulerscheZahl: which is why they dropped on the optim leaderboard already
 dbdr: yeah
 dbdr: Neumann is less active generally, I think
 eulerscheZahl: he said he didn't code for half a year. i countered with his recent contest participations :P
 dbdr: he did SR though
 Illedan: :raised_hands:
 eulerscheZahl: the only one I skipped :D
 Illedan:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: my complement
 eulerscheZahl: sorry Ille. physics is just not my cup of tea
 eulerscheZahl: i'm a square grid player
 Illedan: Not octo?
 eulerscheZahl: never

 jacek: and you, Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i mean, you have a high winrate
 jacek: eeyup I do
 Hjax: automaton speaks the truth 
 TheRandomGuy: oh sorry squid i did not know i was not allowed to post links
 Hjax: you can post links, just not clash links
 Hjax: no one wants to see clash links, most people here arent interested 
 AntiSquid: you can post whatever, but think about the implications and please no nagging
 Astrobytes: and you can still ask if anyone wants to clash, just keep the links out of main chat
 TheRandomGuy: what is nagging?
 Hjax: annoying people by asking them over and over
 AntiSquid: "pls pls join, why you don't join"
 TheRandomGuy: oh
 Astrobytes: ^ asking the same thing repeatedly

 Dartisan: I had to think on this simpsons episode: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_E0CR01laQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_E0CR01laQ</a>
 Astrobytes: Perfect example :D
 sunksuperset370: ello'
 jacek: good evening

 eulerscheZahl: initially the year started in March...
 jacek: uh oh
 Astrobytes: eugh, never liked the Smurfs
 eulerscheZahl: how about the Flintstones?
 Astrobytes: hell yeah
 jacek: christmas in flintsones?
 eulerscheZahl: i never liked Bob the builder
 Astrobytes: And the Jetsons to a lesser extent
 eulerscheZahl: and thomas the train
 eulerscheZahl: boring
 jacek: creepy
 Astrobytes: I loved Thomas as a small boy
 eulerscheZahl: jetsons: never watched
 eulerscheZahl: i don't even have an image in my mind
 jacek: stop that pigeon?
 Astrobytes: Jetsons was just Flintstones in space, and not as good
 Astrobytes: Yeah, Dick Dastardly and Muttley
 Astrobytes: epic
 Astrobytes: loved Muttley's laugh
 jacek: and flintstones in space is stone treck
 Astrobytes: think I saw that on yt once
 geppoz: I have a bug in my python interpreter???? round(4.5)=4&#160;??
 jacek: oO
 geppoz: seems round of .5 decimail is rounded down when the integer part is even??? madness
 eulerscheZahl: rounding to even is normal
 eulerscheZahl: banker's rounding
 geppoz: The round() function rounding strategy and return type have changed. Exact halfway cases are now rounded to the nearest even result instead of away from zero. (For example, round(2.5) now returns 2 rather than 3.)
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Round_half_to_even</a>
 geppoz: "normal" for who?
 eulerscheZahl: though i don't think it's a good idea to change it when it was different before
 eulerscheZahl: normal to bankers of course
 geppoz: if I heard now for the fisrt time then ofc it is not "normal"
 eulerscheZahl: if you always round  the same way, you make wins or losses due to rounding
 geppoz: programming is for math not for bankers :D
 eulerscheZahl: with rounding to even it will cancel out in the long run
 geppoz: ok, goodbye python
 jacek: euler works for banks. when he rounds profits it is even, when expenses it is odd
 geppoz: not serious language :D
 jacek: yeah, D is the way
 eulerscheZahl: no, i consider banks boringwouldn't work there
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://dlang.org/library/std/math/round.html">https://dlang.org/library/std/math/round.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: D doesn't like bankers either
 Dartisan: on german they call it "KaufmÃ¤nnisches Runden"&#160;;-)
 Hjax: i hadnt actually seen that rounding strategy, but it makes sense to me 
 jacek: why in german everything sounds like weapon
 eulerscheZahl: you speak German?shouldn't surprise me actually
 Astrobytes: SCHMETTERLING!
 jacek: :scream:
 Dartisan: Yeah, we learn as first language in school.
 geppoz: then how to "normal" round in python?
 Astrobytes: It might seem aggressive at first listen/look but spoken German sounds wonderful
 eulerscheZahl: what a coincidence. my first was German too :D
 jacek: int(x+0.5)
 eulerscheZahl: what is "normal" rounding supposed to do with negative values?
 geppoz: even shorter, nice
 eulerscheZahl: golfing?
 Hjax: i assume he wants to round away from 0 
 eulerscheZahl: if golfing:int(x+.5)
 geppoz: uhm no, toward +inf
 Hjax: ew
 geppoz: so round(-1.5)=-1
 geppoz: how about the bankers in this case?
 eulerscheZahl: to even
 eulerscheZahl: -2
 geppoz: -2 since it is even
 Hjax: does any languages standard library round towards +inf? 
 eulerscheZahl: rounding can be quite complicated the more you think about it
 eulerscheZahl: but not as ugly as time zones
 geppoz: so they are the same for the positive odd and for the negative even :D
 geppoz: comic
 geppoz: all uses toward +inf IMHO
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY&amp;ab_channel=Computerphile">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY&amp;ab_channel=Computerphile</a>
 Dartisan: please no timezones. 
 Hjax: java supports a bunch of rounding modes, C++ rounds away from zero
 jacek: kree java!
 Astrobytes: every. single. time. :rolling_eyes:
 jacek: nopony got that reference?&#160;:(
 geppoz: java rounds toward +inf the negatives
 geppoz: as javascript
 jacek: what is the round o NaN :thinking:
 geppoz: NaFN

 geppoz: Not a Fractionary Number
 geppoz: :D
 Dartisan: Thanks for the link, will be forwarded on the next days&#160;;-) Perhaps it would be an inspiration to calculate timezones for clashes&#160;;-)
 Astrobytes: "Not a Fractionary Number" I must admit I substituted the F with another word&#160;:/
 geppoz: well i meant the Math.round 
 geppoz: the standard method
 Hjax: Astrobytes thank goodness im not the only one 
 Astrobytes: :D
 geppoz: about the timezones I always managed to convert in epoch seconds
 geppoz: the inputs, so work with that, then convert in other TZ in output
 Hjax: theres no sane way to parse time zones 
 hatf0: there's no sane way to parse
 Hjax: because that would require some logic and structure in the design of time zones
 Dartisan: It starts mostly already on the paper, when the question is, what time counts, client, company, headquarter or server location&#160;;-) 
 jacek: meow
 Unkmar: Agreed, Tom Scott did a video all about time zones.
 Majeck: It was an awesome video
 Majeck: Is there anyway to chat with someone who's not online?
 Majeck: But that you know the username?
 Majeck: *It is an awesome video
 Majeck: hmmmm
 Astrobytes: I think you can just PM them
 Majeck: How?
 Astrobytes: Sorry, think it's only if you follow each other
 Majeck: It seems that if I use the /msg nickname on someone who's not online it doesn't work
 Majeck: Oh you're totally right Astrobytes
 Majeck: Thanks!
 Majeck: Found the button in Profile -&gt; Followers
 Majeck: Thanks
 Astrobytes: Awesome&#160;:)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: mention them in a comment on discord, they will get an email with your comment/request, but it will be public
 Astrobytes: Or just DM them on discord&#160;;)
 Majeck: I haven't ever joined the CG discord hahaha
 Majeck: Is it worth it?
 Astrobytes: Yeah sure, can be interesting at times
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm not on discord much, didn't know DM/PMs were there
 PatrickMcGinnisII: but I do get emails when I'm mentioned
 PatrickMcGinnisII: no spam plz
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Not a heavy user myself other than the CG and a few other quiet servers, it's better than regular social media at least!
 Majeck: What is? Discord?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: alot of stalkers on social media
 Astrobytes: lol, Puzzle of the Week: Spam Patrick the hardest
 Majeck: Hahahhahahha
 Astrobytes: yes Majeck
 Majeck: I would totally join in on that puzzle
 Majeck: Could you imagine though?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: &lt;-- at least i'm ok w/ using my real name.... I have guns...and lots of ammo, heh&#160;;)
 Majeck: I imagine Euler renting some servers and sending over 20m messages a day to PatrickMcGinnisII
 Astrobytes: Mr McGinnis here would be thoroughly unimpressed I believe Majeck 
 Majeck: On the contrary I think he would love all the attention
 Majeck: Who wouldn't like being completely flooded with spam?
 Astrobytes: Quite a few names are known on CG PatrickMcGinnisII, just not really a thing on here
 PatrickMcGinnisII: umm, yea... I can send 500 an hour on MY server w/o help
 Majeck: I recently learned how to use python to control my GUI and sent over 1200+ messages in 15 minutes to my CS WhatsApp group
 Majeck: They were thoroughly annoyed lol
 Astrobytes: Don't be That Guy lol
 eulerscheZahl: i doxxed myself for a RAIC tshirt :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, how long did it take? 6 months?
 Astrobytes: Since they're now a rarity that was a worthwhile investment no?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: only 9 months to ship
 PatrickMcGinnisII: rofl
 eulerscheZahl: and the explosion looks like a hamburger
 Astrobytes: It's the thought that counts
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I keep offerring to laser cut acrylic led plaques for contest winners, then i looked at the shipping costs to certain countries...holy crap...like $100 US from me to Argentina
 Majeck: Forgive my ignorance what's RAIC?
 eulerscheZahl: russian AI cup
 Astrobytes: damn you
 eulerscheZahl: hosted once a year. usually plenty of tshirts to win (360)
 eulerscheZahl: but not this year&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: You get Putin's socks, cash or a voucher
 eulerscheZahl: still waiting for the delivery from last year. corona delayed it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I would mail 3 to FR tho
 Astrobytes: $100 to Argentina from Florida?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yup
 Astrobytes: Pretty damn steep
 Astrobytes: Mind you, mailing most things these days isn't cheap
 Majeck: Couldn't you send them by mail?
 Majeck: Or is the $100 using mail
 Astrobytes: Shipping usually involves mail service at some point yes&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 3 methods to get to Argentina, cheapest was $100 for up to a pound
 PatrickMcGinnisII: to EU not so bad, i sent a few things to UK
 Astrobytes: (that's about 0.45kg normal people :P )
 Majeck: lol
 Astrobytes: Might get more expensive now cause of Brexit Patrick (or cheaper, depending on weird trade deals)
 codeing: #fr

 Astrobytes: Yes codeing, that's the French channel. We know
 codeing: mhm
 codeing: what's up gays?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: a php guy in top 10 of 2048...yall slackin'
 Astrobytes: I'm still ULDR
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i think I'm maxed to due to processing limitations
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so should be easy to beat 1.4M for yall
 Astrobytes: Honestly Paddy, you should try something other than PHP, I *know* you'd smash it
 Astrobytes: Extra effort yeah sure, but dig in :smiling_imp:
 Astrobytes: Put those C skills to use
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Another issue of C for me is I get too involved with inline ASM, and I'll never get any sleep
 Astrobytes: So be it.
 Astrobytes: Release the inner (FL)nerd
 Astrobytes: CG's perfect for obsessing over code optimisation :D
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i love java, but then i'll feel guilty about using it for CG and not android
 Astrobytes: Och just do it laddie
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I run php locally all the time for image manipulations and i don't have to run a big IDE
 Astrobytes: Sure, PHP is cool for loads of stuff
 PatrickMcGinnisII: PY routine add-ons to software make me pull my hair out
 Astrobytes: I think you're wasting your skills sticking with it on CG (just my 2 cents/pence)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm almost a Grandmaster sticking to just php
 Astrobytes: True. But your multi performance would be even better
 PatrickMcGinnisII: yes, the only motivation...sticking it you guys...rofl
 Astrobytes: I don't care either way honestly, I just think you should unleash your inner beast properly 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Haven't fired up VS in like a year or something
 PatrickMcGinnisII: hmmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: might be rusty
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I appreciate the thought
 Astrobytes: I know you know your shit, don't sell yerself short
 PatrickMcGinnisII: crap, i got to go cut some stuff...
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 Astrobytes: All good, catch ya later man

 Zenoscave: happy caturday tomeowow
 kyrillos: peauriebrieake
 Zenoscave: Did euler change 2048 somehow?
 Astrobytes: He added '-' command to disable viewer, and added some more output in the summary I think
 Zenoscave: The viewer is going super fast and then slow for some games
 Zenoscave: might be CG related
 Zenoscave: also getting ERROR: ld.so: object 'libstdbuf.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
 Astrobytes: ah yeah, that's some bug they're looking into
 Zenoscave: shame
 Astrobytes: It's quite recent (today) so guess it'll be fixed quickly

 CodingLegend1: Anyone got a solution for stock exchange losses in c++?
 MadKnight: yea i got
 MadKnight: CodingLegend1
 CodingLegend1: How did you optimize it for test case 05? I was able to get all the others
 MadKnight: u can do it in 1 loop
 MadKnight: and not 2
 CodingLegend1: Hmmm, I've tried doing one loop using max/min but then it fails for 06
 MadKnight: because max can go after min
 CodingLegend1: yeah
 MadKnight: so how to do it&#160;?
 MadKnight: in 1 loop
 CodingLegend1: Haha no idea
 MadKnight: u need not just max or min
 MadKnight: u need more
 MadKnight: so add more conditions
 CodingLegend1: standby, I might be onto something
 Majeck: Can anyone link me to Euler's site to find Codingame puzzles?

 Majeck: Hahahaha
 MadKnight: to find what codingame puzzles, Majeck&#160;?
 Majeck: I meant one of eulerscheZahl's website
 Majeck: I forgot the name but it was basically a search bar for codingame puzzles
 Majeck: MadKnight a really dumb (funny) clash of code puzzle I just played

 DomiKo: I guess this one
 Majeck: It had like 10 lines of statement with unnecessary crap 
 Majeck: Only for at the end say Bob has n eggs and Alice wants m eggs, how many eggs are sold?
 Majeck: It 
 Majeck: Thanks DomiKo
 Majeck: That's exactly what I was looking for
 DomiKo: no problem
 CodingLegend1: MadKnight what data structures did you use?
 MadKnight: ints

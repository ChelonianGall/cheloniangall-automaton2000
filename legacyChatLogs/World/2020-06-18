 CyberLemonade: wow someone had a nice time
 jacek: aww
 LelouchVC2: Hey, Jeff Cavalier, AthleanX.com
 Defflex: i'm new in JS
 Defflex: the Van Eck sequence is pretty hard to me&#160;:(
 rkhapov: gays, do u now flags of C++ compiler?
 jacek: yes, we do. do you?
 LelouchVC2: Wrecked
 rkhapov: i dont
 R8T3D: &gt; when people don't submit their solutions&#160;:(
 R8T3D: on clash
 [4.0]poorgoomba: i submitted
 R8T3D: THANK YOU!
 [4.0]poorgoomba: np
 R8T3D: Wow I don't understand that but thanks regardless
 R8T3D: Much appreciated
 jacek: #pragma GCC optimize "Ofast,unroll-loops,omit-frame-pointer,inline"
 Qoter: AntiSquid why did you ban rkhapov?
 JulioSalamander: Hello, is it possible to use std::map? i have errors only with the include&lt;map&gt;
 jacek: try #include &lt;map&gt;
 JulioSalamander: thanks all
 YurkovAS: jacek in uttt or other mcts multi do you use mcts-solver? Is solver has winrate 65% vs standart mcts?
 jacek: i always use solver. for me this is the "standard" mcts
 jacek: winrate depends on game, but i think i in uttt i got something like 55%
 jacek: in yavalath is a must-have. even if mcts solver doesnt help much, it doesnt worsen mcts either
 karliso: How do you go about implementing mcts solver?
 karliso: Do you see a node that ends, and then check if previous ends as well?
 jacek: i have bool terminal in a node
 karliso: So you check if all children terminal?
 jacek: if i encounter terminal state, if this is a win for player, the its a lose and terminal for a parent
 jacek: if this is a lose, i check all siblings if they are lose. if yes, parent is a win, and grandparent is a lose again
 YurkovAS: jacek thanks
 jacek: whats with the sudden interest in uttt in #ru :thinking:
 darkhorse64: Don't tell me that all these people get so high in UTTT without a solver :scream:
 YurkovAS: +5 new users in uttt legend from #ru in last one week. they found all tricks
 LelouchVC2: #CodeGeass
 darkhorse64: Except for teccles heuristic, there are not so many tricks in UTTT
 CyberLemonade: darkhorse64 what's that?
 darkhorse64: teccles heuristic&#160;? When you play for the first time in an empty miniboard, send your opponent to the same board. I haven't tried it, so I don't know if it applies on rollouts and/or move selection
 CyberLemonade: I see, thanks
 YurkovAS: darkhorse64 solver is hard to understand. do you have good example? not pseudo code from "Monte-Carlo Tree Search Solver.pdf"
 tutubalin: jacek when there's no challenge,  we help new guys in #ru with CSB or puzzles. If there are no new guys, we discuss UTTT.
 Astrobytes: lol, we only discuss UTTT when re Curse isn't here :D
 jacek: pseudo code from that paper is kind of mess, like theyre mixing negamax propagation with normal
 Astrobytes: It's horrible
 darkhorse64: Score Bounded Monte-Carlo Tree Search is an improved version. I implemented from this paper. 
 darkhorse64: Yeah, it's horrible so you have to read carefully between the lines to realize it's plain simple
 YurkovAS: darkhorse64 thanks
 Astrobytes: Yep. I read the paper, then I saw the pseudocode and started questioning whether I had understood it. Had a conversation with Smits to make sure I wasn't going crazy
 darkhorse64: Several pages paper for something that can be explained in two sentences
 jacek: hopefully the results there were legit
 darkhorse64: Just tried google translate on #ru. It does a pretty good job. There's going to be lot of ne comers in UTTT top
 darkhorse64: *new*
 jacek: invasion?
 darkhorse64: Once they stop banging their heads on the solver, I fear that
 tutubalin: too late, we've already annexed legendary league
 Astrobytes: :D
 tutubalin: next major goal is to do that on Python
 darkhorse64: It's one thing to reach legend, it's another to reach the top
 JohnCM: @darkhorse64  that paper sounds interesting
 darkhorse64: The boss is an MCTS which performs at 25K rollouts. Good luck&#160;!
 JohnCM: can you post a link to the score bounded monte-carlo tree search paper
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.621.8607&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.621.8607&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a>
 JohnCM: thanks
 jacek: 25k in second turn?
 LonelySausage_6464: hey
 darkhorse64: Yes. 20-25k second turn. That's what I heard on the chat
 jacek: so what im doing wrong if i get 10k in 2nd turn?
 Uljahn: using solver and 1ply check? :smiley:
 jacek: well yes
 darkhorse64: You have smart rollouts&#160;?
 Uljahn: i guess vanilla MCTS is just plain random rollouts without heuristics and tree reusing
 jacek: theyre not smart. 1ply check is just about choosing winning move and avoiding losing one
 jacek: i have teccles, solved, 1ply check and tree reuse. in rollouts some small bias towards moves that would win small board
 tutubalin: jacek do you use bitmaps?
 jacek: yet having several times slower bot i am at the top
 darkhorse64: Yes. Tree reuse and solver do not reuire game knowledge. Moreover, they are "free". Playing winning moves and avoiding losing moves is also a nice improvement
 jacek: i use bitboards
 tutubalin: how do you check if position is terminal?
 Uljahn: "i have bool terminal in a node"
 tutubalin: i mea in random playout
 jacek: if my main board is terminal. i have table of 512 possible states and just do lookup
 jacek: well any board, not main board
 jacek: for (move&#160;: availableMoves) -&gt; makeMove() check() undoMove()
 tomatoes: i tried to check if possible to win then do it, but no much difference
 WINWINWIN: still cant get the minimax to work for Othello :sob:
 WINWINWIN: worst part is that it looks so simple
 darkhorse64: How do you use teccles: biasing the rollouts, biaising the selection, book move&#160;?
 jacek: just in the beginning. if both players use teccles, it will end up in 18th move
 darkhorse64: As a book move then.
 jacek: WINWINWIN you cant get the minimax part, or the game mechanics?
 WINWINWIN: The minimax keeps returning None as the best move
 WINWINWIN: But printing to stderr shows that the actions are being generated
 darkhorse64: tomatoes: wow #2. Did you add an opening book&#160;?
 WINWINWIN: And the actions are accurate with the initial input
 tomatoes: no, i have no idea how to store it
 darkhorse64: So you climb this high without any hardcoding (except the first move, I guess)&#160;? Any special trick&#160;? Just say yes if you don't want to share. I'm ok with that
 tomatoes: im selecting nodes by heuristic
 tomatoes: no random and ucb with a bit patched formula
 darkhorse64: You found one. It's a common and accepted knowledge that there is no heuristic for UTTT. On other board games, combining evaluation and MCTS yields a powerful bot
 Astrobytes: Smits is gonna love that leaderboard when he sees it :D
 darkhorse64: He claims he can get to #1. It may be harder than he thinks
 Astrobytes: Indeed. He thought he was only up against karlis o
 WINWINWIN: But its only 0.15 points back to #2?
 WINWINWIN: Wouldnt a lucky resubmit put him back at #2?
 Astrobytes: #3
 Astrobytes: Oh right, gotcha lol
 darkhorse64: Yes. It means nothing except that there is a new contender
 tutubalin: jacek when do you create new node?
 Astrobytes: Yep. And when he comes back with his new bot (I believe he's working on that now) then it'll be tuned for karlis o and not tomatoe s
 WINWINWIN: In the top areas of legend league, do people add modifications to cater to the opponents&gt;
 jacek: smits use special opening books for them
 Astrobytes: Guess he's gonna have another few months work :P
 jacek: tutubalin when i expand visited once node
 jacek: he also planned othello
 Astrobytes: Oh nice
 tutubalin: jacek so you don't create it on every random move, right?
 jacek:&#160;?
 tutubalin: one of my failed attempts was when i created a node for every played state
 tutubalin: for example, during random playout i created a node for every played move
 Astrobytes: Isn't that what struc t was doing? Creating nodes for all his playouts
 tutubalin: that was slow and took too much memory
 tutubalin: it would work fine if we had a lot of time and memory
 jacek: i dont create any nodes during rollouts
 tutubalin: but with limitations we have it's waste of resources: most of these nodes will never be visited again
 tutubalin: hmmm.... ok... 
 tutubalin: do you turn optimizations on?
 jacek: of course
 tutubalin: do you use standard C++ random or custom one?
 jacek: custom
 JohnCM: yea rollouts can be huge, especially if the state space is stochastic (affected by random factors)
 tutubalin: hm... than i have no idea why you've got 10k rollouts on 2nd turn
 tutubalin: probably your rollouts are much better than mine
 Astrobytes: Are they heavy rollouts jacek?
 jacek: not much heavy, no
 jacek: or i alwats get lucky resubmits
 tutubalin: have you tried to profile?
 tutubalin: what's the most time consuming part?
 jacek: long ago, most of the time in my games the rollouts are time consuming
 tutubalin: my last idea: probably there's a bug in rollouts counter, and you have 10x times more of them )
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: shouldnt have used int16_t for that
 tutubalin: ahahaha )
 Astrobytes: Seriously? :D
 III: hi
 dbdr: Rust #2 on uTTT&#160;:)
 dbdr: gg tomatoes!
 tomatoes: thanks :sweat_smile:
 dbdr: have you been using rust for long?
 darkhorse64: I'll wreck him in the IDE then 
 tomatoes: no, half year maybe
 dbdr: what did you use before? hard transition?
 jacek: D
 Astrobytes: :smirk:
 tomatoes: python mostly, not hard, but i also dont use most rust features on cg
 tomatoes: threads, async, lifetimes etc
 dbdr: makes sense. multithreading is rarely useful on CG, regardless of language
 dbdr: lifetimes can be, but most of the times there is a simpler solution without them
 dbdr: if you don't use them coming from a GC language, it seems you get it&#160;:)
 dbdr: technically you always use lifetimes in rust, it's just that the compiler infers them and checks them automatically for you&#160;:)
 tomatoes: thanks rustc
 dbdr: indeed&#160;:)
 Kuly2Fraise: hello
 struct: yeah, that was what im doing on uttt Astrobytes
 struct: But I had no idea that mcts did not work like that
 Astrobytes: Easy enough mistake to make
 struct: Also the expand takes up 40% of the performance
 jacek: expandArray?
 Astrobytes: GAexpandimax
 Astrobytes: True Expansion.
 jacek: darn had 1 timeout against java coffee cup

 AntiSquid: hey guys what are you doing? @_@
 AntiSquid: just one minute away from chat and this is what happens&#160;:/
 Hjax: this is nothing compared to last night
 Hjax: last night someone spent about half an hour flooding the chat 
 AntiSquid: i saw that when i entered chat
 AntiSquid: it was form 2 AM my time so no way i'd be up :p
 eulerscheZahl: i think we could expect more dedication from you. disappointing
 AntiSquid: i don't get paid enough to do this
 eulerscheZahl: dedication doesn't need payment
 struct: Yeah, my chat experience was ruined yesterday&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: one star because there is no way to give 0
 dbdr: give 2^32 stars and count on overflow
 eulerscheZahl: 2^31 and hope for am overflow to a negative rating
 AggYz: Guys is it true that some python libraries and modules are built with C/C++
 eulerscheZahl: yes. but if you don't trust whoever told you this, why should you trust us?
 AggYz: becuase
 AggYz: lots of ppl here
 AggYz: 1 person who i read it from
 AggYz: How does python work wiht C/C++
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy</a>"Written in	Python, C"almighty wikipedia, the most trustworthy source of all
 AggYz: how do they work with eachother
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/building.html">https://docs.python.org/3/extending/building.html</a>
 AggYz: Do ppl only build modules with C because of speed or stuff that python just cant do (at least effective and efficiently)
 eulerscheZahl: python is turing complete. if you can do it with C/C++, you can do it with python too. but speed is a good motivation to still use C/C++
 Uljahn: you can build modules even with Fortran
 AggYz: isnt fortan a boomer language
 eulerscheZahl: you can even compile Fortran with some C compilers
 eulerscheZahl: fortran is the first high level language
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/python-usage.html">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/python-usage.html</a>
 eulerscheZahl: interesting history. they even delayed it to add compiler optimizations
 AggYz: when integrating py and c can you call functions and objects or is it just simple reading variable from each other
 eulerscheZahl: not to "burn" the language. when coders decide that it's too slow, they have a negative attitude to an improved version already
 eulerscheZahl: disclaimer: i never tried anything with C+Python
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html">https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html</a>
 AggYz: so you could make a loop in py  then pause after every iteration then make c read it and do stuff with the index then resume in python?
 tomatoes: more like you need to write data to c
 Uljahn: isn't it what happens when you call numpy functions
 AggYz: kikikikikikkik
 tutubalin: AntiSquid there was collateral damage. you banned rkhapov for asking about compiler flags
 Hjax: oh i wasnt scrolled 
 Hjax: good old chat 
 tutubalin: AggYz you cannot just inline C code inside Python. but you can create a C-module which then can be imported from Python code
 tutubalin: Of course C code should be aware that it is used with Python and follow some conventions
 AggYz: oki
 AntiSquid: "boomer language" lol, is older than some boomer's parents
 AntiSquid: fortran is
 AggYz: is there only like 20 ppl who know lua here
 AggYz: what is the minority language here

 AggYz: D has a nice name ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
 AntiSquid: automatonnn lives matter

 jrke: Recurse i tried hard but didn't even completed 1 lap in CSB against you :neutral_face:
 reCurse: Hehe
 Hjax: watching the good csb bots play is so interesting 
 Hjax: i watched a game where re curse's pod bounced off an enemy pod, creating a perfect gap for his second pod to get through 
 reCurse: It's definitely not about racing anymore past a certain point
 Hjax: its about being a massive bully 
 Hjax: and just blocking forever 
 reCurse: Yeah and cooperation
 ViewDeveloper: reCurse what does that icon mean?
 reCurse: Tooltip says moderator
 ViewDeveloper: So you're an employee of the site? :thinking:
 reCurse: No
 FelixvanBeusekom: Guys how do i sqrt() in c++?
 ViewDeveloper: &lt;script&gt;alert("The robots are here.");&lt;/script&gt;
 AntiSquid: is it just NN or are there any conditions you added to your CSB bot?
 reCurse: It basically just means I keep the chat clean as best I can
 ViewDeveloper: darn
 ViewDeveloper: come play coc
 reCurse: No
 reCurse: AntiSquid: The only "just NN" bot is Fenrir afaik
 AntiSquid: sqrt() FelixvanBeusekom, not sure what you mean
 Hjax: #include &lt;math.h&gt; sqrt()&#160;? 
 FelixvanBeusekom: Thanks Hjax
 FelixvanBeusekom: Actually cmath instead of math.h but i got it
 jrke: ya for c++ use #include &lt;cmath&gt;

 NathMin: Anyone else got the CTO lurking on his LinkedIn account&#160;?
 NathMin: My guess is a bot is using his account, but still, weird
 eulerscheZahl: that leads to a follow-up poll: who has a linkedIn account?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Next poll:  who has a LN acct just to weed out fakes?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I have 0 contacts, but I am on LN... what's your point eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: my point is: i don't have "the CTO lurking" on my LinkedIn. But I don't have a LinkedIn account, so it's not surprising
 eulerscheZahl: my social media account is this one on CG

 jrke: recurse do you have Phd(s) in computers 
 reCurse: No
 jrke: k
 eulerscheZahl: agade has a PhD I think. But in Physics
 Astrobytes: w lesavo too iirc, again in some branch of physics
 Astrobytes: hi jrke
 jrke: hey astrobytes 
 jrke: just going to sleep in 10 mins
 jrke: no problem
 NASADeveloper102: Should I really be doing coders-strike-back if I don't have a lot of experience with nueral networks? Well I guess the first question I would ask is, "does it require one"?
 jrke: not till silver its easy till silver
 NASADeveloper102: Easy seems like a very opinionated statement here.
 eulerscheZahl: 100000 players and the arena. and top4 are neural networks
 eulerscheZahl: still plenty of players without
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 jrke: i just have simple simulation and in legend with 189 rank
 eulerscheZahl: there are also minimax, monte carlo tree search, genetic algorithms, ... on the leaderboard
 jrke: smitsimax also
 NASADeveloper102: Simple still seems pretty complicated.
 eulerscheZahl: personally i don't even think that CSB is a good game for getting started
 NASADeveloper102: Perhaps it's simple to you. It may not necessarily be to me.
 reCurse: Neural networks are no concern to you until you care about breaching top 4 legend
 Hjax: pr2 turned out to be pretty straight forward and fun
 jrke: but CSB have tutorial in starting i think so
 Astrobytes: Just depends on your experience I guess whether CSB suits you or not
 Astrobytes: Plenty other games to try out, that's for sure
 eulerscheZahl: it took me a while to understand the turning angle and why i should slow down. just missed a proper description of physics
 eulerscheZahl: "beginner friendly" :rolling_eyes:
 jrke: but these things are in gold euler 
 Hjax: ghost in the cell is also pretty easy to get started with 
 NASADeveloper102: What is the incentive for getting legend?
 Hjax: pride! xp!
 Hjax: thats about it 
 Astrobytes: + bragging rights if you can get to the top
 wattakuki: Damn I just started this website today and I can't get past the first level without help /./
 eulerscheZahl: occasionally there are contests on CodinGame. You can win tshirts and other goodies there. Multiplayer games are just for fun and learning
 jrke: :smiley:
 WINWINWIN: Astrobytes, have you ever encountered a continous None output in minimax?
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 Astrobytes: No, because I don't use python WINWINWIN :P
 jrke: hey winwinwin
 Hjax: if minimax is returning none, you have a bug
 eulerscheZahl: but we have to wait a few months till the next contest&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: But sure, I've had no move returned when I had bugs
 jrke: ya october or november
 WINWINWIN: :D
 Hjax: i suppose theres no hope of another surprise contest like OOC?
 jrke: next contest
 Astrobytes: Wait for second wave of COVID Hjax
 eulerscheZahl: a surprise contest would require an existing game
 Hjax: i guess the unofficial contest was the surprise contest 
 eulerscheZahl: OOC was an old prototype, as no one had anything else
 eulerscheZahl: went much better than expected
 Hjax: i see
 Astrobytes: Was a lockdown-special
 eulerscheZahl: i think the next bot contest i'll play will be mini RAIC
 eulerscheZahl: no date announced yet
 jrke: k
 dbdr: Hjax: step 1, start a new pandemic
 eulerscheZahl: what soup do you want to try?
 jacek: frog soup
 dbdr: toad
 eulerscheZahl: :scream:
 jrke: :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: :runner:
 Astrobytes: Toad-licking should do it
 Hjax: maybe we can convince thibpat to do another unofficial contest in a month or two

 Astrobytes: Definitely eulerscheZahl
 Astrobytes: goodnight jrke, sleep well

 jrke: gn astrobytes
 USE-TO: We need python3.8 support
 Astrobytes: hey jacek, good work in Othello, tric is struggling to get back on top (for now)
 jacek: yeah he resubmitted and was 2nd
 Astrobytes: I saw&#160;:)
 trictrac: gg jacek yout bot is strong
 jacek: so lesson today: keep your lucky resubmit
 trictrac: *your
 jacek: thx
 Astrobytes: It is very strong, what did you improve today? Or you don't wanna say
 jacek: better move ordering, fixed killer heuristic so it wont overwrite best move from TT
 jacek: as well adjusted weights for eval
 Astrobytes: Nice. Was a very clear improvement, well done again
 LelouchVC2: We need C++22 support
 LelouchVC2: I want features that I don't yet know I want
 Hjax: move gen in othello looks annoying 
 Astrobytes: Why?
 Hjax: because if a move is legal or not depends on the state of the rest of the board 
 Hjax: its not like chess, where you just look at one piece 
 Hjax: some chess engines dont even care about check making moves illegal, and just allow the king to be taken 
 Hjax: because forced loss is avoided anyway 
 Astrobytes: It's not too difficult, just some shifting and whatnot
 jacek: you just need to copy paste clever bitboard tricks from internet and your good to go :v
 Hjax: lol
 Hjax: oh hey look, the chessprogrammingwiki has an othello page
 Hjax: amazing 
 Astrobytes: I think I need to look for some of those
 Hjax: i found someone just precomputing a table of all legal moves for a given row 
 jacek: for testing eval i use random xot openings so i could see if eval is really better or just better against my old bot
 Hjax: and then just rotating their bitboard 
 Hjax: well, keeping rotations of their bitboard 
 struct: If you think othello is annoying
 struct: you should see yinsh
 struct: :p
 Hjax: i clicked on yinsh once 
 Hjax: i noped out of there real fast 
 Astrobytes: "i clicked on yinsh once" - meme-worthy

 PatrickMcGinnisII: :joy:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fair numbering puzzle took me a couple hours, but got it down to 18 lines
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'llc all today a success, now to mow the frickin' lawn
 PatrickMcGinnisII: glhf
 AntiSquid: mowing lawn is probably more enjoyable
 anyo: HEY
 AggYz: guys 
 AggYz: I have question
 AggYz: what are pipelines
 Hjax: like, for continuous integration? 
 Hjax: if so, then its an automated process for building / running / testing the code you push to a repository 
 NASADeveloper102: I doubt this, but I'll ask anyway. Does using C++, or any compiled language decrease execution time in bot programming puzzles?
 LelouchVC2: If you're asking because the puzzle says ur solution is taking too long
 LelouchVC2: Then no I'd say. It should be referring more to time complexities
 NASADeveloper102: Okay that makes sense.
 NASADeveloper102: I haven't gotten that, but I figured that was a thing.
 LelouchVC2: Try to make your program do less work - make it work smarter not ahrder
 LelouchVC2: harder*
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks!
 LelouchVC2: &lt;3
 struct: NASADeveloper102 you mean on multiplayers?
 NASADeveloper102: Yes
 Uljahn: do you mean time limits?
 NASADeveloper102: As I said, I haven't gotten an error regarding the time it takes to execute code.
 NASADeveloper102: And I don't mean time limits.
 struct: Which multi?
 NASADeveloper102: Any of them
 NASADeveloper102: Will the answer change per each one?
 struct: shouldn0't
 NASADeveloper102: Okay then
 struct: Just wanted to know if it was multies
 struct: so compilation time should not matter
 struct: what matters is execution time
 struct: Which is the same for all languages
 NASADeveloper102: I know the compilation time shouldn't matter.
 NASADeveloper102: But thank you for that latter piece of information.
 Hjax: you are given the same amount of time, but obviously a faster language will get more done in that time 
 struct: This doesnt apply to puzzles though
 struct: at least for some
 Hjax: theres a reason you dont see any python bots at the top of uttt
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 struct: Rust has release mode
 struct: C# does too
 struct: C++ has pragmas
 NASADeveloper102: Release mode?
 Hjax: when you run a language like rust in the IDE, its compiled in "debug" mode, which is slower but gives you more helpful errors 
 Hjax: when you hit submit, its compiled in "release" mode, which is much faster 
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks.
 NASADeveloper102: Do you recommend a bot programming competition I should try first?
 MPSI_LIV_CronierDamiano: hey guys 
 NASADeveloper102: Hello.
 MPSI_LIV_CronierDamiano: is there someone who know ocaml&#160;?
 struct: Which type of games do you like nasa?
 NASADeveloper102: What type of games do I like?
 NASADeveloper102: I like RPGs like pokemon.
 Hjax: well a beginner should probably play a game that isnt too hard to wrap your head around, im currently looking at Ghost in the Cell, which looks pretty straight forward 
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks for the recommendation, I'll look into it.
 Hjax: i also recently played Platinum Rift 2, that was pretty fun and straight forward as well 
 NASADeveloper102: Okay, I'll probably write these down.
 NASADeveloper102: These all have leagues right?
 Hjax: platinum rift 2 does not 
 Hjax: it just has a normal leaderboard 
 Hjax: still an enjoyable game
 struct: Fantastic bits
 struct: best game
 NASADeveloper102: Okay, cool.
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks!
 Uljahn: yinsh is better :smirk:
 NASADeveloper102: yinsh?
 Hjax: i would not recommend yinsh to a beginner 
 struct: yinsh might be a bit hard for starting
 NASADeveloper102: I see, okay.
 NASADeveloper102: Do you mean beginner to programming, or beginner to puzzles?
 Hjax: both 
 NASADeveloper102: Or perhaps a mixture of both?
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 struct: These modules are driving me crazy 
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 NASADeveloper102: Also another question, why is coders strike back so, infamous here?
 Hjax: because it has by far the most users on its leaderboard
 Hjax: also the game is pretty difficult imo, but maybe im just bad at games like that 
 struct: Game is hard to get to top 50/100 maybe
 struct: But I think it's a good to learn
 NASADeveloper102: Okay, thanks!
 Hjax: personally i find grid based games to be way more straight forward 
 struct: It has a guide on how to write a sim written by a cg user
 NASADeveloper102: A "sim" meaning simulator?
 Hjax: yes 
 Hjax: a lot of games on this site benefit from having a sim in your bot, to figure out the outcome of your actions 
 NASADeveloper102: I don't quite understand the benefits of a simulator in a bot.
 Uljahn: predicting the future
 Hjax: ^ 
 NASADeveloper102: I see.
 NASADeveloper102: So you take the game variables and you use those to predict the future.
 NASADeveloper102: I assume?
 Hjax: if i do this, and he does that? what will happen? a sim answers that question 
 NASADeveloper102: Huh.
 NASADeveloper102: Neat.
 struct: Then you evaluate
 struct: The best state
 Hjax: yeah then you ask yourself, i do this, and he does that. do i like the result? what if he does something else?
 NASADeveloper102: Whenever creating "self-sustaining" programs I usually use a finite state machine, is that what you mean by "state"?
 NASADeveloper102: I think that makes sense.
 Hjax: you go through all of your actions, and all of your opponents actions 
 Hjax: and find the combinations that result in the best situation
 Hjax: assuming your opponent plays optimally 
 NASADeveloper102: Wouldn't this result in a large execution time?
 NASADeveloper102: I guess not if you write it well enough, or the game is simple enough.
 LelouchVC2: HEADLINE: A bot that uses Random numbers to generate random moves destroys opponents
 NASADeveloper102: 0 _ o
 Hjax: if you are curious, look up the minimax algorithm 
 NASADeveloper102: Okay, sure.
 Hjax: generally bots that use it run until they run out of time, and go with the best move they found 
 Hjax: but you have plenty of time to look quite a few moves into the future 
 Hjax: depending on the game 
 NASADeveloper102: Okay.
 NASADeveloper102: Cool.
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks, I never knew this.
 NASADeveloper102: I really appreciate this.
 struct: Also there is AVX&#160;:)
 NASADeveloper102: AVX?
 NASADeveloper102: Is that another algorithm? 
 struct: no
 NASADeveloper102: Is AVX a bot programming puzzle?
 struct: Advanced vector extensions
 NASADeveloper102: o _ 0
 NASADeveloper102: What exactly does this mean?
 struct: Imagine you have 8 floats
 NASADeveloper102: Okay.
 struct: and you want  to add those 8 floats to another 8
 struct: with avx those 8 floats take the same time as 1 float
 NASADeveloper102: :thinking: Huh.
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/what-is-sse-and-avx">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/283/sse-avx-vectorization/what-is-sse-and-avx</a>
 struct: This you can skip
 struct: If you don't need it
 NASADeveloper102: :thinking: Okay
 AggYz: guys what are doubles
 AggYz: i dont undestand what double data tyes are
 struct: doubles?
 AggYz: y
 AggYz: ye
 AggYz: yes
 Idleless: If you know what a float is, it's double the precision of a float (twice the size, same function). If you don't know what a float is, it's a real number (a number with a decimal place. example: 3.1234)
 AggYz: hwo double precison
 AggYz: how
 struct: more bits
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: what are numbers?
 Automaton2000: i need a new object
 NASADeveloper102: This is a bot for codingame?
 NASADeveloper102: Where does 
 Uljahn: ye, there are two of them
 NASADeveloper102: Where does it get it's messages from
 NASADeveloper102: also what is the second bot
 struct: chat
 struct: AutomatonNN
 NASADeveloper102: Huh neat.
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code and it works for me i was wrong about that in the code 
 Idleless: @AggYz <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://hackr.io/blog/float-vs-double">https://hackr.io/blog/float-vs-double</a>
 AggYz: @Idleless thanks
 AggYz: /me
 NASADeveloper102: Also hasn't this been here for a long time? I mean the bot. So how does it choose the messages from such a large amount of them?
 <b>**AggYz has thanked you</b></p><p><img src="/a/44017889745482" /> Hjax: it doesnt choose messages, it generates them, learning from chat 
 Uljahn: with Markov chains
 NASADeveloper102: Wow I just suspected that it chose a random message based on one already spoken.
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/code-your-own-automaton2000-step-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/code-your-own-automaton2000-step-1</a>
 Automaton2000: some of the things i do in the next round
 AggYz: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12609480e5e47a803afd9890eac4000e5ef766f">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/12609480e5e47a803afd9890eac4000e5ef766f</a>
 AggYz: any1 jooin im lonely
 NASADeveloper102: What is the point of clash of code?
 Hjax: depending on who you ask, there isnt one 
 AggYz: fun
 AggYz: fun
 AggYz: learn
 AggYz: flex
 AggYz: ez
 NASADeveloper102: What circumstances would make you have to write code for an answer to a prompt quickly?
 AggYz: interview
 Hjax: job interviews
 NASADeveloper102: And you would have to beat other people.
 Uljahn: or bots
 AggYz: this is basically interviews
 Hjax: not everything that is fun has to be useful 
 NASADeveloper102: I was thinking a coding competition
 Hjax: if you think its fun, go play it 
 Hjax: ive played a bit of it, its alright
 NASADeveloper102: Well I guess if it's useful in a job interview.
 NASADeveloper102: I should try to spend at least an hour a day doing it.
 struct: Clashes have downsides
 NASADeveloper102: Because a social media life, is something I lack.
 Hjax: honestly i like playing a multi has more benefits to a job interview than clash 
 Hjax: i feel like* 
 Uljahn: agreed
 reCurse: Social media is the worst invention of the last decade, so no worries
 NASADeveloper102: What benefits would outweigh the ones ones for clashes?
 struct: in clash you will get bad coding habits
 AggYz: how
 Hjax: code written quickly has the tendency to not be particularly good code 
 NASADeveloper102: Probably.
 NASADeveloper102: But couldn't you say that you can learn to find a solution to a problem quickly and then write code for it?
 NASADeveloper102: But I guess the same problem arrives.
 NASADeveloper102: The quality of the code could potentially be lowered.
 struct: I  have 3695 clashes, and I don't recommend them
 reCurse: It's not code you should be interested in but problem solving
 AggYz: i agwee with wecuwse
 reCurse: For clash there's definitely diminishing returns
 struct: most clashes are math problems and parse strings anyways
 NASADeveloper102: Okay.
 NASADeveloper102: Is there a memory limit in multiplayer puzzles?
 Hjax: yes, 768 mb 
 Uljahn: multis teach you staying focused on large tasks, thinking of architecture, performant data structures and optimizations i guess
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks
 NASADeveloper102: You probably can't include other libraries that aren't in the standards right?
 Hjax: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a> list of libraries by language here
 Uljahn: check <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 NASADeveloper102: I mean like pandas?
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks.
 Hjax: python does get pandas yes
 NASADeveloper102: Thanks.
 NASADeveloper102: Do you think the PS5 is going to live up to the hype it's getting?
 AggYz: no
 NASADeveloper102: Well that was surprising?
 NASADeveloper102: Why?
 tomatoes: games &gt; specs
 NASADeveloper102: Huh, yeah you're right.
 NASADeveloper102: I don't play console games, but I was thinking about getting an xbox or play station.
 NASADeveloper102: So I can be introduced into the console gaming world with their accessories and money making schemes.
 NASADeveloper102: And then I can feel the anger among gamers that have to spend money on seemingly meaningless things, that are required for some games.
 NASADeveloper102: or features of them.
 tomatoes: i have only psvr, used it ~2 times
 NASADeveloper102: . . . 
 NASADeveloper102: How do you use something a negative amount of times?
 NASADeveloper102: Anyway.
 NASADeveloper102: I assume, "psvr" is play station virtual reality?
 tomatoes: around two times
 tomatoes: yes
 NASADeveloper102: Wouldn't it make sense to put ~2 and not -2
 tomatoes: as i did
 NASADeveloper102: Wait a minute....
 NASADeveloper102: That's tilda?
 NASADeveloper102: What is this font?
 tomatoes: tilda, yes
 NASADeveloper102: Huh.
 struct: -~
 Reksio: Hi All. Does anyone know how Submitted application deal with Jit compilation? I know that code which first time runs for 1800 microseconds can run in just 15 microseconds if it runs 2nd time just after the first run. Is every submitted puzzle run twice at least?
 Reksio: Or even every test case...
 Reksio: Or is some kind of AoT (CoreRT) compilation used?
 eulerscheZahl: your code is run once on every testcase. the speedup to account for JIT languages is to give 1s for the first turn. you have less time for later turns, whenever there is a  loop of repeated input and output

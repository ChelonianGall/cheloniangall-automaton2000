 nicesoul: guys, is it a way to have a private codinggame with my friends using this service?
 KalamariKing: what do you mean a private codinggame
 KalamariKing: like a private clash of code? codingame is the platform
 nicesoul: like the fishbowl game for example. I mean what can i do to invite the person in the same room?
 Scarfield: nicesoul on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer</a> there is 3 dots top right of the clash of code link, press them, and you get the option to "launch a private clash"
 Scarfield: you have to hover your mouse over the clash of code to get the dots to show
 nicesoul: thank you, Scarfield
 Scarfield: np&#160;:)
 jacek: so tomorrow nothing happens eh
 Scarfield: caturday?
 JHBonarius: wow, compilers have improved since I last compiled my bots. static analysis is finding bugs now
 Scarfield: one day they will auto complete algorithms
 KalamariKing: thats a scary thought
 JHBonarius: well, I've been using vs2022 for work... the intellicode autocomplete is often right
 Scarfield: damn, didnt know that was a thing, i suppose "one day" could be in the past :p
 TheBlueBias: Scaryfield
 Scarfield: TheBleuHorror
 KalamariKing: have you seen that gpt3 can program for you, given a sentence or two of what you want it to do
 Uljahn: it can also insert comments and private keys :smirk:
 Scarfield: yea, not sure if its really useful yet, but it at least shows it probably will happen to some extent
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: more spaghetti to spaghetti god
 Automaton2000: i need a good bot
 TheBlueBias: Antisquid is the natural enemy of KalamariKing. :nerd:
 JHBonarius: btw: Is there an Antisquid game?

 jzen: How non-coder friendly are the escape rooms?
 Wontonimo: if you play with other coders, then it's fine.  by yourself, no so
 jzen: But is it actually enjoyable for the non-coders?
 Wontonimo: idk.  i've never played.  i'm not a fan of escape mazes irl or otherwise
 jzen: How come?
 Wontonimo: i've played several escape mazes, just wasn't fun
 Wontonimo: idk, just isn't my cup of tea
 Wontonimo: probably because i suck at them

 struct: lol
 Astrobytes: hahaha, now that is what you call lacking vocabulary

 worlpaker: Hi guys
 Deiwyy: C U M
 eulerscheZahl: really looking forward to that 1 weekand watching the world burn in chat logs
 eulerscheZahl: meanwhile i got threatened to get killed in private message
 Astrobytes: ffs
 eulerscheZahl: "my asassins will kill you eulerschezahl"recurse is right, these messages are surprisingly entertaining
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 Astrobytes: They are the bonus we get for our mod duties
 struct: I think its always the same people
 struct: anyways see ya next week I guess
 eulerscheZahl: yes, see you
 TheBlueBias: Why next week?
 Astrobytes: I'm still gonna be here, I just won't do anything
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 Astrobytes: Exactly.
 TheBlueBias: What? What's gonna happen? :fearful:
 eulerscheZahl: making a contest for the 95% while the mod team is the 5%. that's going to happen
 eulerscheZahl: we will be ultra inclusive
 TheBlueBias: What contest? :thinking:
 Astrobytes: Hahaha, very well stated euler
 TheBlueBias: They'll stay on discord anyway...
 eulerscheZahl: i guess removing the phishing links from discord is fine. those can do some real harm if someone falls for it
 TheBlueBias: "The other place... Where I can't go."
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'll still do that
 TheBlueBias: Phishing? :fish:
 Astrobytes: Yeah, links to a famous jam bands music
 eulerscheZahl: some bot spamming a dlscord. that is dLscord with a login screen
 TheBlueBias: At least here the bots are friendly... Right Automaton2000?
 Automaton2000: i think you have to worry about
 eulerscheZahl: oh, the captcha bot is in place already
 TheBlueBias: :scream:
 Astrobytes: It is? Nice to be notified
 eulerscheZahl: check the audit log
 eulerscheZahl: about 28h ago
 TheBlueBias: Noticed? By CG? :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if thibaud is on vacation
 Astrobytes: Ah yeah, I see it.
 TheBlueBias: You mean more than usual?
 Astrobytes: Was about to ask about that, he normally tells us if he's gonna be off, maybe sick or something
 eulerscheZahl: true. this time he's just not shown as online
 lolimagine: ayyyyyyy
 lolimagine: i got unbanned
 Astrobytes: 3... 2... 1...
 eulerscheZahl: then use your 2nd chance wisely
 lolimagine: thank the mother ******* lord 
 Astrobytes: thin ice already
 lolimagine: brooooo thats not nice....
 lolimagine: ill be good
 lolimagine: promise!!!!
 lolimagine: astrobytes do you got discord 
 struct: after your first sentence I had everything ready
 lolimagine: bro not nice....
 lolimagine: im just trying to code gomie
 TheBlueBias: So to see if T is in vacation, just look if you see what game he's playing on discord. If not, he is.
 lolimagine: homie**
 lolimagine:   BRO THIS CHAT IS SO COOL BROOOOO
 lolimagine: :money_mouth:
 eulerscheZahl: you are 1 day too early for this
 Astrobytes: lol right
 struct: shame that I cant ban for 16 hours
 Astrobytes: don't worry, they come here every day
 TheBlueBias: Someone should renew the site certificates tomorrow, to unban all the trolls, and release their fury!
 Astrobytes: oof
 TheBlueBias: Totally possible. They'll probably try to do some hot fix about one hour before the event start... :smirk:
 Astrobytes: Only one issue: It ain't a Friday
 TheBlueBias:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: i wonder if their escape is stable enough to handle that sudden amount of users
 struct: i still remember locam sprint
 Astrobytes: Well, they did a test-run with the Sherlock(?) mini-'contest' 
 Astrobytes: struct: hehehehe
 Astrobytes: That was grim.
 eulerscheZahl: right. how did Sherlock go?
 Astrobytes: I don't recall any problems. I didn't play it though.
 eulerscheZahl: i did half of an escape. had a few white screens that required a page reload
 eulerscheZahl: and the &lt;connect&gt; and multiple editors confused me
 struct: the multiple editors is for each player
 struct: you can write on other players editor
 struct: its quite nice actually
 Astrobytes: I figured that part out pretty  quick
 Astrobytes: Yeah, agreed struct
 Astrobytes: we didn't have any tech issues did we?
 struct: dont think so
 eulerscheZahl: and the first hint is public already: Roman numberals
 eulerscheZahl: have a close look at the candles in the artwork
 Astrobytes: numberals?
 eulerscheZahl: -b
 Astrobytes: Yeah I saw those
 eulerscheZahl: so just nagging about my typo?
 Astrobytes: Could be a red herring
 Astrobytes: Yes :D
 Westicles: ugh.  an 800 LOC ascii art contrib
 Astrobytes: lol, I saw that. Even with the proposed reduction in solution size it just looks helluva tedious
 jacek: what contrib
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/74799252ae2ecb6c58600923d9635d14447b">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/74799252ae2ecb6c58600923d9635d14447b</a>
 Westicles: only the #fr can stop it
 jacek: ahh java
 struct: is that a clash?
 Astrobytes: No, Hard puzzle
 jacek: reverse shortest
 YurkovAS: jacek when we train NN: we select only 1 best move by nn and thats all? no deep simulate, as in bots 100ms?
 jacek: youre talking about a0-style?
 YurkovAS: for mcts (AlphaZero)
 YurkovAS: i'm try to understand how to train NN like AlphaZero
 jacek: you plat fixed number of iterations, then choose best (with some probability) move
 jacek: play*
 YurkovAS: iterations evaluated by this NN?
 jacek: yes. in a0 there are no playouts, just eval from the NN
 YurkovAS: thanks!
 jacek: then after the game is finished, youll put position -&gt; policy,value training samples into buffer when the NN will train later from
 jacek: personally i train only value, i never trained policy
 Piotrullo: hi
 jacek: hello
 YurkovAS: understanding NN is long way for me :smile:

 struct: maybe a list of required skills 
 struct: It goes a bit beyond coding
 jacek: you need math :unamused:

 Queuebee: does anyone know how pointers work
 Astrobytes: Queuebee:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/YmqPKmT">https://imgur.com/a/YmqPKmT</a>
 Astrobytes: (from the discord, not my post)
 Queuebee: im crying
 Astrobytes: But it's clear and to the point.
 Queuebee: lol
 Queuebee: HA, TO THE POINT
 Astrobytes: lol, pun was unintentional
 Queuebee: well, it helped. i solved my problem after starting at it for30 minutes
 Astrobytes: I notice you're in bioinformatics, if you're gonna be using pointers then you need to take a dive into how memory works.
 Queuebee: I'm going to quit bioinformatics 
 Queuebee: what do you mean memory
 Queuebee: like, the brain
 Astrobytes: But R is great!
 Astrobytes: RAM
 Astrobytes: memory
 Astrobytes: random access memory
 Queuebee: yeah where I come from we don't talk about that
 Astrobytes: But when you ask about pointers you talk about memory
 Astrobytes: (I have a cell biology masters btw)
 Queuebee: I've learned to use a forloop for each letter i want to count in a file with dna. with pythonsreadline().count(letter) 
 Astrobytes: They don't teach you much in your bioinformatics class huh
 Queuebee: maybe I didn't pay attention
 Astrobytes: Where did you pay more attention? Clearly your focus is slightly off
 Astrobytes: Focus on what you *want* to do
 Astrobytes: (within reason ofc)
 Queuebee: yeah well my goals are off the charts but I guess it keeps me interested
 Astrobytes: What are your goals?
 Queuebee: I want to learn how to write speedy efficient multithreaded scalable low energy consuming programs
 Queuebee: with cool maths
 Queuebee: but I can't get a floodfill to work or come up with a heurtistic myself so it will take a while
 Queuebee: and i suffer from major deprEMature optimization disorder lol
 Astrobytes: Then use the right languages for the right purpose;C/C++/Rust etc will get you speed but you need to understand about memory for one thing.Prototype it in python, then reimplement in some other language if needed
 Astrobytes: You're doing T-Ron right?
 Astrobytes: iirc
 Queuebee: WHAT'S THAT
 Queuebee: TRON?
 Queuebee: NEVER HEARD OF THAT
 Astrobytes: Hence the hyphenation
 Queuebee: o
 Queuebee: well yes im trying to get my t-ron program to work in cpp now
 Astrobytes: Cool. You don't need pointers for this.
 Queuebee: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fad83b7c-7716-4f05-bee2-968fbd85ac81">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/fad83b7c-7716-4f05-bee2-968fbd85ac81</a>
 Queuebee: oh no
 Queuebee: it pastebinned me
 Queuebee: and i didnt even write neat code
 Astrobytes: You still don't need a pointer just for that
 Astrobytes: You can get away with stack allocation for that array 
 struct: my secret is not to use pointers
 Astrobytes: 4 minutes until we stop divulging information and preventing spam struct
 Queuebee: hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
 Astrobytes: 3 in fact. Or do we count it from challenge start time?
 Queuebee: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/18a8a2f7-ed16-4110-a19c-bc7f18025a6e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/18a8a2f7-ed16-4110-a19c-bc7f18025a6e</a>
 Queuebee: OMG is the challange going to start
 Queuebee: I'm not ready
 struct: i will wait until it starts
 Astrobytes: Don't worry. It's not a coding contest.
 Queuebee: oh still 17 hours
 Queuebee: whats hpapening in 1 minute
 Astrobytes: 5pm right struct?
 Astrobytes: (for us)
 struct: I think so
 struct: I havent checked
 Astrobytes: Neither have I. It's that or 4pm iirc
 struct: whats wrong with that code Queuebee?
 Queuebee: its good now
 struct: ah ok
 Astrobytes: nothing struct, this is the fixed version
 struct: YurkovAS did you find any improvement on c4?
 Queuebee: but i had [Y*HEIGHT+1] and I coulndt grasp why array[409] accessed the last element when the array was SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED TO [30(20]
 Queuebee: but i had [Y*HEIGHT+1] and I coulndt grasp why array[409] accessed the last element when the array was SUPPOSED TO BE FILLED TO [30*20]
 Queuebee: oh uparrow doesn't actually CORRECT a message . my bad
 YurkovAS: struct yes, one, yesterday
 struct: I need to improve solver and add TTs
 struct: but I probably wont do it anytime soon
 YurkovAS: in random rollouts reduce possibleWinMoves calls to 1 times
 struct: so you update it after every move?
 YurkovAS: yes, only one
 struct: that should help a bit
 struct: its probably my most expensive function
 struct: and I call it 2 times  each time i do 1 move
 YurkovAS: buy need 1 call after each 1 move
 YurkovAS: *but
 Astrobytes: why 2 struct?
 struct: one for current player and 1 for opponent
 struct: I guess I dont need to calculate opponent again before he moves
 YurkovAS: yes
 Astrobytes: That would make sense
 Astrobytes: anyway, gn
 YurkovAS: gn
 struct: gn

 TheAlmightyMystery_606: hi
 trulynameless.: i am so excited for the fall challenge
 ipsissimus: hey all, ive got a jank python solution that i'd like suggestions on if you all are willing
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff51d101-f422-4169-8084-97ef0352c518">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ff51d101-f422-4169-8084-97ef0352c518</a>
 ipsissimus: im sure i dont have to make a list 'k' to deal with index of each char, but the IDE complained until i made a list
 ipsissimus: any tips to make this less jank?
 Husoski: @ipsissimus You're doing lots of extra work.  You don't need the k list at all, for example.  Just use the string b.  Also, take the extra 'g' out of the b string.
 Husoski: @ipsissimus but it's even easier than that.  if (char) is a lower case letter, the position in the alphabet is or(char)-ord('a'), or just ord(char)-97 if you need to reduce size and/or speed.
 ipsissimus: i tried the same thing before i added the list k
 ipsissimus: and the IDE complained about 
 ipsissimus: no substring literal
 ipsissimus: or something like that
 Husoski: All you're doing with k is calling .index(), right?
 ipsissimus: yes, when i did print(b.index(char))
 ipsissimus: no problem
 ipsissimus: but when i did q.append(b.index(char))
 ipsissimus: it complained
 ipsissimus: and im not sure why
 ipsissimus: that was my motivation for adding k
 wyenat: I don't know what the code is for, but if you want all letters, you don't need to type down all letters [chr(a) for a in range(97,123)] will give you all letters too in a list
 Husoski: Just put the space in the literal string, or do b = b + ' '
 Husoski: I wasn't going to go down that rabbit hole, since there's probably an A/B problem here anyway.
 ipsissimus: im going to try and reimplement with the string so that i can try to get the exact error again. hard to remember exactly what the complaint was
 ipsissimus: its this puzzle if you want to see it<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/88547643e7823d994c127d4700781280ee4168">https://www.codingame.com/ide/demo/88547643e7823d994c127d4700781280ee4168</a>
 Husoski: You know that the min() built-in function works on strings, right? 
 ipsissimus: no, i thought it had to have some value to minimize
 ipsissimus: it mins chars too?
 Husoski: Try min('deadbeat')
 ipsissimus: wow
 ipsissimus: that wouldve made it alot easier ti think
 Husoski: Now all you need to do is get rid of the spaces before calling min().
 Husoski: To see why, try min('dead beat')
 ipsissimus: ah, spaces are less than alphas?
 Husoski: Yep. 
 Husoski: The string .replace() method is one easy way to remove characters.  You're going to need that later anyway, right?
 Husoski: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace</a>
 ipsissimus: no, the question only wants us to remove the "minimum letter"
 ipsissimus: so clash of code
 ipsissimus: becomes
 wyenat: Ok, just solved it. 
 ipsissimus: clsh of code
 ipsissimus: heres my implementation using some suggestions
 ipsissimus: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef723378-e69d-4ead-8289-d33c24cf2982">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ef723378-e69d-4ead-8289-d33c24cf2982</a>
 ipsissimus: id like to see yours if youll share it :O
 Husoski: Yes.  You could use .replace() to remove all occurrences of the 'a'.
 wyenat: s = input()let_min = chr(min([ord(i) for i in set(s.lower()) if i.isalpha()]))s=s.replace(let_min, "")print(s)
 ipsissimus: to save a for loop?
 Husoski: Give me a few minutes.  I didn't do that one.
 wyenat: The point is&#160;: ord and chr give you respectively the ASCII value of a char, and the char letter of an ASCII number. That removes the need for any loop
 ipsissimus: i see, i should avoid loops if possible to make it O(1)
 ipsissimus: oh but, there is still a for loop
 Husoski: It's still O(n), but the loops are in machine code, not Python bytecodes.
 wyenat: You won't be able to make it O(1), because O(1) means your solution is not dependant of the size of the input, and since you have to check all letters inside, your O(n) at best
 ipsissimus: i understand
 ipsissimus: at least getting rid of the second for loop
 ipsissimus: is better
 ipsissimus: with replace
 ipsissimus: i didnt consider it. thanks
 wyenat: Just so you know, when you're used to python, you make all those fancy one liner, but any solution you can think of is valid 
 ipsissimus: yeah, im just trying to get the 'best' implementation, not necessarily a different one
 wyenat: if you want to do manually do a loop, that's not any less quality. The thing we're discussing is how to make your life easier.
 ipsissimus: Im at a point where im trying to understand why one implementation is suboptimal and not just different
 ipsissimus: obviously my double for loops is suboptimal
 wyenat: string.replace is a very usefull function, and it's part of the set of string manipulation tools python offers. 
 Husoski: Working offline, you can use the timeit module to see how fast things run.  
 wyenat: I wouldn't say your second loop was sub-obtimal, it did what a print(s.replace) would have done pretty much  flawlessly.
 ipsissimus: yes, i blast my code with timeit() and run it through flake8 every time too
 wyenat: The first loop however is a huge source of corner-case fails
 ipsissimus: well, in my last company people would deny my merges because of things like imports not being in order etc
 ipsissimus: :nerd:
 ipsissimus: alphabetical order*
 ipsissimus: im trying to move away from my standard jank style of 'if it works its good enough'
 wyenat: For instance " " is not a lower-case caracter, if one of the validator was this, you would have failed it.
 ipsissimus: i see, i wouldve had to throw an extra if clause in there for the ' '
 wyenat: if you had a string with 1000 characters "z" and then "a", you would have missed it too, because of your m=999
 ipsissimus: lol yes, i checked all the testcases to see lengths, normally id use math.inf
 wyenat: nvm i just see the constrain length is lower than 255
 ipsissimus: ya 3 digits
 Husoski: Use len(input string)+1 and you don't have a problem.
 ipsissimus: i just did 999 cuz im lazy
 Husoski: Ever.
 wyenat: you also can use float("inf") 
 Husoski: Ick.
 Husoski: Int vs. compare drive hackles up my old C/Assembly spine!
 wyenat: The +1 is not needed, since the index of the last char is len(s) -1
 Husoski: *int vs. float
 Husoski: The point is to use the size of the input to describe the size of the input.
 ipsissimus: thank you both for the insight
 wyenat: I started with MIPS assembly too, I kinda want to propose a challenge that will float overflow that good old python, like asking what is 1.0e32+1.0 
 Husoski: I have 3 lines that aren't all that fancy.  Don't know how to share them, though.
 wyenat: Just copy paste here
 wyenat: :D 
 ipsissimus: just paste it no?
 Husoski: s = input()least = min(s.replace(' ',<i>))</i>print(s.replace(least, <i>))</i>
 ipsissimus: i also started with mips, c and assembly
 ipsissimus: i did EE in uni
 ipsissimus: but only python for the past 4 years
 wyenat: Actually I'm thinking a huge corner case not tested in that exercise is upper cases
 ipsissimus: why replace the space ' ' with empty char <i></i>
 ipsissimus:&#160;?
 ipsissimus: i need to preserve spaces
 Husoski: So min doesn't return a space.
 wyenat: In uni I had to do a whole OS in C / MIPS
 ipsissimus: yeah i remember taking microprocessor architecture and having to design an instruction set
 Husoski: .replace() doesn't change the string.  Strings are immutable (which is why you couldn't use .append).  It returns a copy with the replacements made.
 ipsissimus: opcodes and everything
 ipsissimus: ah, i didnt even know that strings were immutable
 wyenat: Everyone complained that it was hell, but I actually enjoyed it. The  pipeline design of the computer was really tricky but enjoyable
 ipsissimus: that would make sens
 ipsissimus: can the let_min call in wyenats code be rewritten with map()?
 Husoski: My first job was at a community college where i wrote a database engine in assembly.  IBM 370 mainframes in those days.
 Husoski: functools.reduce() is more like it.
 ipsissimus: I feel like as fun as assembly was, no one nowadays cares about assembly it seems. which is fine because i havent touched it in years
 Husoski: You want min(s[0], min(s[1], min(s[2], ...)))
 ipsissimus: ive never used reduce() either
 Husoski: It used to be built-in in Python 2, but was moved to functools in PYthon 3.
 ipsissimus: ya im reading the doc now
 Husoski: functools.reduce(min, 'abc')
 wyenat: Assembly is overkill is 99% of the cases. Unless you're doing critical embedded design, even C is overkill, and you can go with something much more company friendly like Java
 ipsissimus: i was working on CV and ML stuff on RTOS 
 ipsissimus: and still they wanted C
 Husoski: Try getting Python on an 8-bit controller sometime.
 ipsissimus: not assembly
 ipsissimus: we're lucky that in this day and age, anytime i have to program a controller
 ipsissimus: i can just hit ctrl-c ctrl-v
 Husoski: Someone had to write the BIOS
 ipsissimus: godbless that dev
 wyenat: &gt;&gt;&gt; ord(" ")32
 adoxography: Please don't use functools.reduce(min, 'abc'). min('abc') can handle that just fine.
 ipsissimus: :eyes:
 ipsissimus: :popcorn:
 ipsissimus: i just want to get under 1k rank in CoC
 Husoski: Good coding technique is usually bad clash technique, and vice versa.
 ipsissimus: oh yeah, ive learned a ton of bad habits
 ipsissimus: but ive learned how to use map()
 ipsissimus: how to unpack lists wit h*
 wyenat: I got it, just finishing the CoC path will let you around 600 without efforts
 ipsissimus: how print(end=) lets me cheat not using ' '.join()
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Anyone know why this happens when I display a char in printf?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: N0r��V
 ipsissimus: im working on it
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: zThe character is N
 Husoski: Not performant, calling print() on every character, but it's a winner in shortest clashes sometimes.
 wyenat: Don't agree, because in shorted you often want to use I=input and I(your_solution) 
 Husoski: @TheBrokenTraveller_5024 You're sending non-ASCII codes.
 wyenat: to reduce the the 5 characters of print to 1
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: @Husoski, how do I fix this?
 wyenat: What is in your printf? 
 Husoski: What's the printf look like? 
 Husoski: You might have a bad format string.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024:  fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", dir_x);
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Just using the debugging one
 Husoski: ...what's dir_x then?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: char dir_x[1] = "N";
 Husoski: Use %c, not %s to print a char.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: printf("%c\n", &amp;dir_x);
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024:&#160;?
 Husoski: Make that char dir_x[2] = "N";
 Husoski: You didn't leave room for a terminating 0 byte.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Oh
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: char dir_x[2] = "N";fprintf(stderr, "%c\n", &amp;dir_x);
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Correct?
 Husoski: Nope.  Back to %s now that the string is valid.  I misread the original at first.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Ah okay, that works
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I have been wondering why this has not been working haha. Thank you very much!
 Husoski: C or C++?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: C
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: It works now though
 wyenat: You're hurting youself man
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Programming class for uni
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Teacher require
 wyenat: Good ol teacher with the C
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: #Engineering
 ipsissimus: eh, c was my first
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: haha
 ipsissimus: good primer id say
 wyenat: They don't require FORTRAN so much now but C is gonna stick a few years
 Husoski: It's become the substitute for assembly in a lot of places.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I already know, for the most part, several programming languages
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Just never work with chars
 wyenat: It's incredibly usefull and powerfull, don't get me wrong, but for CodinGame where 90% of the puzzle are string manipulations, that about as bad as doing it manually :D
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Oh yeah lmao
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Incompatible pointer to integer conversion assigning to 'char' from 'char [2]'
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Any clue what this means as well?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: dir_x[1] = "W";
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Attempting this
 Husoski: Segfault in the making, maybe.  Probably any printf() will find a 0 to stop on before running out of legal address space, though.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: So I probably don't need to worry about it?
 Husoski: You've overwritten the terminator without providing a new one.  There's no room for it in char[2] either.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I do not understand what you mean
 wyenat: Do you know how computer know where a string finish?
 wyenat: They end with \0 
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Right yes
 Husoski: If dir_x[0] == 'N' and dir_x[1] == 'W', then where's the \0 going to go?
 wyenat: Well if your string has a length a 2, a a character inside, you're not leaving enough room for a "\0" to be inside
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: But am I not replacing it?
 wyenat: In C, your char is length + 2 of what you want
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: So then how would I bypass this?
 Husoski: Oops.  Misreading again.  That's really shouldn't compile (wouldn't on my C setups).  You can't store a pointer into a char:
 Husoski: dir_x[1] = "W";
 Husoski: ...says to put "W" into dir_x[1], but "W" is a (const) char array and a C array is converted to a pointer (to the first element) in most expressions.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Right
 Husoski: What are you *trying* to do?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: (light_x &lt; initial_tx) {
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: if in the beginning of that
 Husoski: That much better.
 Husoski: that's
 wyenat: A bit unrelated, but it seems you're trying to print a W if a condition is met, else print a L. In that case, the char * is not needed, use ternary operation printf((condition)?"L":"W");
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Well even then, I still get the same error
 Husoski: Did someone redeclare dir_x to be a char[1] again?  
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: char dir_x[2] = "E";This is the only declaration of this
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I have not redeclared it
 Husoski: It was "N" before.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I am trying to change the letter from E(initial declaration) to the new letter
 Husoski: Should work.  Is this a string because you need "NE", "SW" etc.?   If it's always a single char, why not make it a char?  (...and printf with "%c")
 wyenat: Oh is it for Power of Thor? 
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: This is the combination of these two: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c6cf1c61-6a45-4536-b231-ddb7cc5dd056">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c6cf1c61-6a45-4536-b231-ddb7cc5dd056</a>
 Husoski: You really should add dir_act[2] = 0; at the end to make sure of a terminator.  In that code snipped, array initialization shoud put zeroes in any unspecified array entries, though.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: For the case of the dir_x
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: dir_x[1] = 0;
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Something like this?
 Husoski: Yes.  After last *used* byte in string.  In general, when you're appending to a string, you may not know what was in the string from before.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Ah okay, thank you for the help!
 Husoski: There's also the &lt;string.h&gt; functions to simplify some of this, but they have their own issues.  
 Husoski: Hope some of that helped.  It's hard to debug in a chat window...
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Yeah\
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: dir_x[1] = 0;
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Even with this though, I still get the pointer error
 Husoski: Which is?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Incompatible pointer to integer conversion assigning to 'char' from 'char [2]'
 Husoski: Oops.  dir_x[0] = 'W';
 Husoski: Single quotes.  It's a char.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: those actually matter&gt;?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I did not know that actually
 Husoski: 'a' is a char. "A" is a string.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: So capital letters?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: require ""?
 Husoski: This is common to C++, Java, C# and other C-inspired languages.
 Husoski: No.  *strings* use double quotes, char constants use single.
 Husoski: dir_x[0] is a char, not a string. It's the first character of the dir_x string.
 Husoski: I'm going now.  Gotta practice guitar, lesson's tomorrow!
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Enjoy!
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Wait, one more question
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: If you do not mind
 Husoski: ok
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: else if (light_y == initial_ty) {
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: How can I make this be empty?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: I have tried like dir_y[0]=0; but did not work
 Husoski: dir_y[0] = 0; or dir_y = '\0';
 Husoski: What did dir_y = 0; do?
 Husoski: What did dir_y[0] = 0; do?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: What did dir_y[0] = 0; do?-Did nothing
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: dir_y[0] = 0; this
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Array type 'char [2]' is not assignable for dir_y = 0
 Husoski: It's an empty string (not even a \n) so printf on it will do nothing.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Well, I need to empty the string
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: So it has nothing
 Husoski: The plain dir_y = 0 was a typo.  I meant dir_y[0].  What was supposed to happen when the string was empty that didn't happen?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: right
 Husoski: And what were you expecting to see that you didn't?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: If I comment the dir[y]=0; out then I get the dir_act to display
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: but if I keep that line in, nothing is displayed
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: dir_y[1] = 0;
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Now if I do this. it gives me the results but the S is still there but according to my conditional, since the light_y and initial_y are equal in value, the dir_y should be emopty
 Husoski: Oh...I see.  You really need to look into strcpy and strcat to save headaches on glueing strings together.
 Husoski: You don't have a fixed-length string now, with exactly 1 char.  You have variable length strings.
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: but I thought you said I needed it to be 2?
 Husoski: Try this, though: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c71c7530-4476-489b-ae58-53ddf8582787">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c71c7530-4476-489b-ae58-53ddf8582787</a>
 Husoski: You're probably better off using &lt;string.h&gt; with strcpy and strcat, though.
 Husoski: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte">https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/string/byte</a>
 Husoski: Anyway, good night and good luck (hey, that was a movie!)
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Can you explain the first one?
 TheBrokenTraveller_5024: Oh okay, thank you for the assiatance

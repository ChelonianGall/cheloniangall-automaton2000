 Potatobol: hi
 Potatobol: i dont know how to code
 MrZee: &gt;Makeprogramdothing;
 Kerr.: is there a way to turn off automatically making parens and brackets in doubles
 Blokops: yes
 Blokops: a answer a bit too late&#160;:/ 
 Blokops: go to config in the left side
 Blokops: editor configuarition
 Blokops: and put false on the autoamtic bracket creaition
 Blokops: Kerr.
 Kerr.: tyvm Blokops
 Tien2k9: why i can't use auto-complete in codingame?
 <b>**Tien2k9 is wondering</b></p><p><img src="/a/72226922640128" /> <b>**Tien2k9 hmm</b></p><p><a href="/wiki/File:Default_avatar.png" class="image"><img alt="Default avatar.png" src="/images/5/56/Default_avatar.png" decoding="async" width="50" height="50" /></a> Kerr.: autocomplete, like autocomplete statements?
 Kerr.: I'm only early in, but I'm a little annoyed that every challenge involves string inputs/outputs
 Kerr.: are there any of the games/challenges that have a mini-api?
 Tien2k9: nah
 Blokops: Tien2k9 vscode has a timer for the autocomplete
 Blokops: it went up with an update
 Blokops: same way as above you can short it but you need to add the command to do so and i dont know what it is
 SSisthebest: yo hi dudes
 Dark_Hack: hello
 Mortis_666: hi
 BeardedKitten_5f8d: Hey folks, I just started on this and Thor has achieved his goal, on all four TestCases, yet i still have 0%, and i have already solved this in two different ways. is it looking for a specific answer?
 eulerscheZahl: no specific answer expected, feel free to share your code. just paste it here

 eulerscheZahl: if(lightX == 31 &amp;&amp; lightY == 4 &amp;&amp;  initialTx == 5 &amp;&amp; initialTy == 4 )
 eulerscheZahl: that's hardcoding
 leojean890: euler
 eulerscheZahl: you are supposed to write something likeif (initialTx &lt; lightX) Console.WriteLine("E")
 eulerscheZahl: leojean890
 leojean890: read that&#160;!

 leojean890: I've just approve for those reasons&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: ok, hardcoding time...
 eulerscheZahl: still lacks some precision in the statement (how do distances work?)
 leojean890: but I understand your point of view^^ but I think that my reasons are a good reason as well to accept it :p
 eulerscheZahl: It must be very difficult to approach the optimal score.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/contribution-guidelines">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/40701/help-center/contribution-guidelines</a>
 eulerscheZahl: using a website to paste a few lines took me less than 5 minutes
 leojean890: ah you're right&#160;! we can compare our simulation with what th referee sends back as a distance
 leojean890: to verify euclidian for example
 eulerscheZahl: it is euclidian. but written nowhere
 jacek: should be eulerian
 leojean890: we should update the statement yes 
 leojean890: the contributor forgot about that
 eulerscheZahl: and you didn't read my whole comment
 leojean890: do you have news about RAIC&#160;?:P
 eulerscheZahl: or another one further down which also mentioned it

 eulerscheZahl: stupid German customs. sending my tshirt + hoodie back to russia without even informing me

 leojean890: I will re-read your comment now to see if I didn't see something
 eulerscheZahl: don't bother, it's approved already
 jacek: im 1st :tada:
 eulerscheZahl: somehow that black background depresses me
 eulerscheZahl: uhm, did the creator screw up the leaderboard sorting?
 eulerscheZahl: high=good
 jacek: oh my
 leojean890: but about your comment, I prefer an optim against a puzzle, because it's motivating to improve more and more :P
 eulerscheZahl: well, that's a variation of the problem. but easy enough to transform so that concorde can still do the job
 leojean890: jacek2 236 125
 leojean890: leojean890532 136
 leojean890: I spent more than 20 hours on most optims
 leojean890: and less on puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: there is a line in the config that tells CG whether you want to optimize for low or high scores. but it will wipe out the current leaderboard and not just resort it
 jacek: its still time
 leojean890: 2219406 using print(range(n))
 leojean890: 532 136is a easy SA
 leojean890: an*
 leojean890: with 1 mutation
 leojean890: only
 leojean890: hill climbing*
 leojean890: eulerscheZahl in the end of your comment you meant that the computation is not accurate&#160;? 17112.00 vs 17112.8&#160;?
 leojean890: I don't find how to revert the leaderboard while editing a published contrib
 BeardedKitten_5f8d: @eulerscheZahl Thank you
 eulerscheZahl: config.ini has to be changed: asc &lt;=&gt; desc
 eulerscheZahl: but i see it as the creator's task to do so. someone just has to tell him
 eulerscheZahl: and yes, that small rounding error. probably not relevant
 jacek: approvers these days...
 jacek: float vs double?
 MrZee: we all float down here
 eulerscheZahl: i was talking about the precision of concorde itself
 eulerscheZahl: but maybe it's accurate and just prints a rounded value, no idea
 leojean890: zLuki the creator, but offline (may contact him with forum)
 leojean890: leaderbord sorting was not visible while testing the contrib
 leojean890: for multis people who try are ranked
 leojean890: in a leaderboard dedicated to the contrib
 leojean890: not for optims idk why
 leojean890: it would be a way to debug that before approcing
 leojean890: approving
 eulerscheZahl: i'm last
 leojean890: maybe it would be better if the contributor used more validators, as well
 leojean890: 5 is a little short
 leojean890: 201k I see:)
 leojean890: will try to do better :P
 eulerscheZahl: there is a limit of 30 (testcases+validators)
 leojean890: but there are only 5 + 5 there ^^
 eulerscheZahl: no, 5 tests + 15 validators
 leojean890: oh yes that's right
 leojean890: I saw that 
 leojean890: forgot then
 eulerscheZahl: 17k-ish is a typical score for 300 nodes
 eulerscheZahl: between 17 and 18 actually, not below 17
 leojean890: because they never use huge coordinates&#160;?:P
 leojean890: type (1000, 3000), (80000, 90000) =&gt; no point of doing that :p
 leojean890: I'm not really experimented on this problem, but motivated&#160;; the concept is easy enough to try many things easily
 eulerscheZahl: but not suited for an optim IMO
 eulerscheZahl: because it's too well studied
 leojean890: didn't try to findi a Hamilton path
 leojean890: it's nice for an optim, but not interesting for too advanced people I guess
 leojean890: for example it would be bad for a contest
 eulerscheZahl: the hamilton path was about <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/oneofus/">http://www.hacker.org/oneofus/</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you'll need flash to see it
 leojean890: but optims/multis are kind of a zoo
 leojean890: that are here to train, improve
 leojean890: some people just push existing codes
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know another optim where the proven optimal solution is that easy to obtain
 leojean890: ah my adobe flash is not compatible^^
 eulerscheZahl: basically you have a grid of different objects (shape, color)
 eulerscheZahl: and you have to find a path where you stay in the same row or column and 2 continuous objects have the same color or shape
 eulerscheZahl: i converted that into a TSP problem and used concorde to solve
 eulerscheZahl: generating the full adjacency matrix took longer than the actual solving process (100MB files pre-SSD)
 eulerscheZahl: darkhorse64 is pretty close to the optimum already
 leojean890: shape/color is the theorical definition&#160;? but here it's coordinates instead in the implementation&#160;?
 darkhorse64: I have had more than a week to work on it. 30 + submits already on the demo
 eulerscheZahl: talking about hacker.org - but let's forget the Hamilton path
 leojean890: I have to study that on my side&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i piped it into concorde, took me 10min to do it manually on all testcases
 leojean890: I did 500k with this basic hill climbing
 leojean890: but have many things to try
 leojean890: I didn't know concorde before today :p
 darkhorse64: eulerscheZahl: your solution is "concorde" hard coded&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: proven optimum
 eulerscheZahl: i will be gone from the leaderboard when sorting is reversed
 eulerscheZahl: proving a point here
 leojean890:  Concorde and Linkern enable to compute adjacency matrixes I read?

 leojean890: thanks eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: it prints out the optimal tour
 leojean890: I see
 leojean890: so many people can cheat if they want :P
 darkhorse64: No worries, eulerscheZahl. I approved it because I was interested in the problem but it looks clear it may be a bad optim because hardcoding is too easy
 leojean890: like hypersonic with the rgeat contest code shared :P
 leojean890: great
 leojean890: darkhorse64 same I wrote that in comment
 eulerscheZahl: that's a different issue IMO
 eulerscheZahl: one is blatant cheating
 leojean890: it's interesting for people who are not expert (like me^^)
 leojean890: to improve
 darkhorse64: ^
 eulerscheZahl: using code specifically taylored to a CG problem
 eulerscheZahl: the other is using commonly available knowledge
 leojean890: not for contest where people would cheat
 eulerscheZahl: and you can still write an awesome bot and beat the published HS one
 eulerscheZahl: you can't beat optimal
 leojean890: yes^^
 leojean890: hopefully people will not cheat too much
 eulerscheZahl: not even sure if i should consider that cheating
 leojean890: but it's not a big problem, the most important is the practice opportunity I think in multis and optims
 Ftyghi: hi
 leojean890: I think that you are able to code a great optim code without cheating ;p
 Ftyghi: hi 
 eulerscheZahl: great players don't cheat to get great results.they cheat to get them faster
 leojean890: yes they can :P
 Ftyghi: hi can anyone see my message
 eulerscheZahl: no Ftyghi
 leojean890: so, in contest we need original new topics
 Ftyghi: :confused:
 leojean890: and in multis and optim we add practice topics
 leojean890: to motivate people
 leojean890: your creation of OOC was great for example (existing board game but to transform it into an IA contest)
 eulerscheZahl: i still think that a puzzle would be a better place for an optim with a known optimal solution
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't do much on OoC actually
 eulerscheZahl: i saw the game 2 days before everyone else and helped to polish it up
 leojean890: but people will be more motivated to improve and try things if there is a leaderboard and a score comparison
 leojean890: and a puzzle, if you pass it you stop improving&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: let's agree that we can't agree then&#160;;)
 leojean890: ok about OOC^^ it was with Illedan and G-ROM from CG&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: mostly G-Rom
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan started with me
 leojean890: yes but you have a better level than me so you don't have the same concerns than me xD
 leojean890: your aim is to have new topics
 leojean890: only
 eulerscheZahl: i wanted to seriously dive into it on the weekend. and then Thibaud was like "can we start the contest on Friday?"
 leojean890: I see, too bad you can't polish optimally
 eulerscheZahl: there were some minor problems with OoC at first, but in general it worked better than I expected
 darkhorse64: it lacks a destroying mine feature, imho
 eulerscheZahl: mines drowning after X turns
 darkhorse64: but it's a great FoW game
 leojean890: yeah I liked it
 leojean890: destroying mines would me nice and make the game harder
 leojean890: would be*
 leojean890: and mor complex/interesting
 leojean890: more
 eulerscheZahl: i really wanted to look into bomberland today. now i'm still chatting about TSP
 eulerscheZahl: see you later
 darkhorse64: I was thinking more about mine exploding mines or torpedo destroying mines. So there would be a tradeoff between increasing your detectatibility(?) and finding a safe path
 eulerscheZahl: looking at the starter codes and what it takes to port it to C#, I already lost all my motivation again&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: OoC is a close port to Captain Sonar. I don't know the rules of that game
 leojean890: would be a good idea darkhorse64
 leojean890: I don't know bomberland 
 eulerscheZahl: oh, konstant found a way to score even lower than me on TSP :D
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.gocoder.one/docs/getting-started">https://www.gocoder.one/docs/getting-started</a>
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1280948902">https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1280948902</a>game in action
 eulerscheZahl: competition is really weak
 darkhorse64: There are actually a few significant differences: the sonar for instance
 eulerscheZahl: giving 2 values (e.g. x and y)
 eulerscheZahl: where one is the truth and the other is a lie
 eulerscheZahl: but would complicate the protocol
 eulerscheZahl: bomberland communicates via websockets. stdin/stdout would also be possible and lower the bar to write your own bot without sticking to their language options&#160;:(
 darkhorse64: I do not miss this feature (sonar). Time for new multis. Struct is making an Ataxx.
 leojean890: I'll look into bomberland 
 leojean890: konstant has 6% for the moment, didn't see that xD

 eulerscheZahl: and the twitch stream above to get a better idea what it's about
 eulerscheZahl: their platform only plays games once a week
 leojean890: thx
 darkhorse64: CG benchmark would take ages ...
 Dark_Hack: hello eulerscheZahl
 Dark_Hack: my old friend
 leojean890: CGB dies not work anymore because of the limitation of ide plays
 darkhorse64: just kidding
 leojean890: it's too bad their limiattion&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: CG Benchmark? you can't start games yourself (except for offline testing)
 eulerscheZahl: you submit and wait a week to get the results
 eulerscheZahl: (on the bomberland website)
 leojean890: oh ok but on CG it makes plays
 leojean890: and woth the limitation it does not work
 leojean890: good
 leojean890: after 150 plays it's going slow
 leojean890: on bomberland idk I have to test first
 Illedan: Good morning
 Illedan: So I guess the goal in TS is to get as long as possible path
 eulerscheZahl: i see you joined the TSP too
 Illedan: I wonder if my score gets updated when I make a longer path 
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: sure
 Illedan: How does Jacek even get a longer path
 eulerscheZahl: concorde allows a matrix for distances. so i could do 1000-actual dist for each pair and generate the longest path
 eulerscheZahl: what are you doing?0 1 2 3 4 0
 Illedan: Yeah..
 eulerscheZahl: and Zorg is greedy I suppose, as that score appears twice too
 Zorg1: yes i'm greedy :p
 eulerscheZahl: btw i won't resubmit my optimal solution when the leaderboard sorting gets fixed. So i should just be gone completely then.
 eulerscheZahl: just pointing out a serious flaw in puzzle design. you need an extra twist to make it suitable
 Illedan: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: e.g. combine it with Search Race: visit all points in an arbitrary order by driving with the car
 eulerscheZahl: shortest TSP path may have some unpleasant corners
 minhminhbi: it's so hard
 Zorg1: CSB meets salesman&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: jacek your turn
 minhminhbi: i'm newbie
 minhminhbi: of pyhton
 eulerscheZahl: salesman strikes back
 eulerscheZahl: *salespersonprof told me about a colleague who really had to rename that chapter
 eulerscheZahl: publisher didn't like salesman
 Illedan: WTF
 Illedan: Why do I need to start and finish at 0
 Illedan: -.-
 Illedan: That was 5 min I'm never getting back
 Illedan: Let's go inverse TSP
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl first :O
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/SXa0eNU.png">https://i.imgur.com/SXa0eNU.png</a>
 jacek: hmm.. is it travelling or traveling
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: what ever happened to the snake optim? 
 Illedan: I lost motivation
 eulerscheZahl: what is missing? just the JS animation?
 Illedan: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: should be doable and i like the snake idea for a game
 eulerscheZahl: is your code public?
 Illedan: Yeah
 antiwonto: [automated] Illedan please don't repeat yourself
 Illedan: ...
 Illedan: And it is missing random board sizes
 Illedan: I'm FIRST!
 Illedan: :D
 eulerscheZahl: distracting me...
 eulerscheZahl: first by 600 points
 Illedan: ezpz
 darkhorse64: I start to believe that I missed the point of this optim
 Illedan: The sort is wrong
 Illedan: So we are just having fun
 Illedan: Game is too easy anyway
 darkhorse64: I know. Just kidding. Not so easy when you practice diy
 darkhorse64: "do it yourself"
 eulerscheZahl: take that, the toad is back
 Illedan: Take what?
 eulerscheZahl: my lead
 Illedan: Noooo
 ASM_MOV_INT: that toad.... is froggin!
 darkhorse64: It's me :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
 Illedan: Ahhh, darkhorse64 cheating
 darkhorse64: no, it's legit
 Illedan: Gotta bring out the big gunns
 Illedan: hmm
 C26_1: Hello everyone
 C26_1: I have a new sequence of numbers
 C26_1: I have calculated up to 14 terms and this is the sequence:1 5 2 3 5 6 8 5 1 1 0 3 0 8
 eulerscheZahl: OEIS doesn't know your sequence
 C26_1: The pattern for the sequence:- Look for decimal expansion of its inversion (n = 1 at first term)- Find the largest number that has the most concurrent in that inversion
 C26_1: For example:
 C26_1: n = 51/5 = 0.2Since 0 and 2 appear one times, then we output the largest number, that's 2
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: Wait for me
 C26_1: 1 5 3 5 2 6 8 5 1 1 0 3 0 8

 UnnamedCodinGamer: how is the ranking score in the newly approved tsp optimization game calculated?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I thought that the distance must be minimized
 Illedan: The ordering is wrong, but we are having fun trying to maximize the path
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I see
 UnnamedCodinGamer: thanks
 UnnamedCodinGamer: are the validators public for this problem
 UnnamedCodinGamer:&#160;?
 Illedan: Yeah
 Illedan: In the contribution

 Illedan: Yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: nice
 wlesavo: oh tsp is up nice
 UnnamedCodinGamer: actually I am seeing a link to the source code only on the "view contribution" page
 UnnamedCodinGamer: which is not available to all
 struct: you need level 29+ yes

 leojean890: darkhorse 3 248 344
 leojean890: heurstic + HC powaa
 wlesavo: damn already max submits
 leojean890: hehe
 leojean890: when will the creator invert the leaderboard hmm
 eulerscheZahl: it's more fun this way acutally
 leojean890: so that you invert your heuristic functions
 leojean890: it's fun as well :P
 jacek: blame the approvers
 wlesavo: even if he will the lladder is needed to be reset manually 
 leojean890: will try to modify my HC to SA
 struct: darkhorse64 I think I understand the ataxx notation now for blocks
 leojean890: I tried to do this instead of him :p but not psosible in the edit part
 leojean890: why does not CG enable the leaderboard for optims in contrib part ....
 leojean890: and they do for bots prog
 leojean890: because we would have seen the problem before
 leojean890: should add that to the checkist of TODO stuff
 leojean890: and when an optim is in contrib part I already like to compare to know if my code is good or not:p
 leojean890: sample&#160;: snake (still in contrib)^^
 struct: was snake finished?
 darkhorse64: struct: will you encode only block config, notation and generate the blockers from it&#160;? Not easy but saves mucho typing tables
 struct: probably yeah
 struct: since there seem to be over 200 board setups, I dont feel like typing them all by hand
 jacek: no books?
 darkhorse64: 200 
 struct: no jacek
 struct: 596 boards
 leojean890: snake is not finished but I can't have the ranking list
 leojean890: it would be better for both reasons
 leojean890: (testing the leaderboard and testing the contrib while comparing)
 struct: random should be terrible from what im seeing, wont have to worry much for the boss
 Wontonimo: what are we talking about?  is this a multi contrib?
 struct: yes, ataxx

 pascal_beast: kk
 Wontonimo: thanks.  neat game
 Manchi_o6o7: Hey guys. Has anyone maybe a resume.io subscription
 eulerscheZahl: that inverse TSP seems much harder, at least for concorde.no heuristics for an initial solution i suppose
 eulerscheZahl: running for minutes on 100 nodes already
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: we were speaking with dapo about this TSP last night, would adding a set of sub-nodes to each node be an improvement
 Astrobytes:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: (e.g you must visit at least 1 or n subnodes from each node before moving on)
 eulerscheZahl: i think this could indeed help against well known strategies
 eulerscheZahl: but it's approved already
 eulerscheZahl: a certain someone read half of my comment, then approved and rubbed it into my face
 Astrobytes: and not every sub-node needs to be directly connected to another main node
 struct: with his current it will most likely be gonne soon
 eulerscheZahl: i'm already triggered again, maybe my CG break wasn't long enough
 Astrobytes: just seeing it now
 eulerscheZahl: i suggest a rewording of your idea to see if we mean the same:you have nodes and groups of nodes
 eulerscheZahl: you have to visit each group a given number of times, then move on to the next group
 Astrobytes: Yes, so instead of just one node as it is now, each one has it's own group, or neighbourhood I suppose
 eulerscheZahl: and i admit i'm one of the 1-star reviewers
 eulerscheZahl: willing to change that when the problem gets modified
 Astrobytes: I should have moved my approval to reject last night as I wanted to speak to you about it
 jacek: :unamused:
 eulerscheZahl: hm, just thinking out loudyou should not have to visit all nodes in the end. otherwise you could just adjust the edge matrix
 eulerscheZahl: and btw i checked the chat logs this morning and saw daporan. that's why i even found the contrib
 Astrobytes: good
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.hacker.org/oneofus/">http://www.hacker.org/oneofus/</a>that's where i know concorde from
 eulerscheZahl: solved it in 2017, how time flies
 Astrobytes: I got my head in a pickle doing a google search crash course in parts of graph theory I'm vague about lol
 Astrobytes: Sad loss that site
 eulerscheZahl: i've learnt some theory about it at university. but mostly heuristics like Christofides
 eulerscheZahl: and GA, ants and such
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002007108002736#:~:text=Ant%20colony%20optimization%20for%20TSP,nest%20without%20using%20visual%20cues.&amp;text=So%20the%20ants%20randomly%20choose%20their%20path%20with%20equal%20probability">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1002007108002736#:~:text=Ant%20colony%20optimization%20for%20TSP,nest%20without%20using%20visual%20cues.&amp;text=So%20the%20ants%20randomly%20choose%20their%20path%20with%20equal%20probability</a>.
 eulerscheZahl: not recommending that one in particular, the first that came up on google
 Astrobytes: yeah I know the ant colony optim method
 Astrobytes: Going back to the CG TSP: what is better, finding the shortest route at each node neighbourhood or just visiting n nodes in each? And should some of those neighbourhood nodes connect to other main nodes?
 DomiKo: Am I blind? Or maybe this puzzle never tells you for what you are getting points? (I know answer is obvious but still)
 jacek: you get participation medal
 eulerscheZahl: it doesn't tell
 eulerscheZahl: i also wrote that in the moderation section before it got approved :smirk:
 jacek: blame the approvers
 eulerscheZahl: i do
 DomiKo: :rage:
 Astrobytes: quiet jacek, you were present at the discussion last night
 eulerscheZahl: and did he approve?
 jacek: :innocent:
 eulerscheZahl: but back to your suggestion. let me read and try to understand your idea
 Astrobytes: no, but if he had anything to add he could have said something
 jacek: i didnt. i only made comment that in debug mode points could have hover information
 Astrobytes: I was floating these ideas last night but there was nobody around with sufficient knowledge to answer me
 kovi: oh, new optim
 kovi: i meant a real one(as code keeper became a multi)
 DomiKo: I like how the word 'shortest' occurs only in the Example section.
 eulerscheZahl: and nowhere does it say "Euclidean"
 DomiKo: And Rules section is written like it is some Clash.
 eulerscheZahl: I already found the shortest for all 15 validators: 201,389
 eulerscheZahl: but we are looking for the longest now
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: clearer explanation - each main node is a country, there is a neighbourhood of cities in each.
 eulerscheZahl: ok, that sentence is clear
 Astrobytes: Do you find the shortest route around each country before visiting the next?
 eulerscheZahl: that would add a small variation but not sure if big enough
 Astrobytes: And are any of these cities connected to another country? (e.g a freeway/autobahn or back road)
 eulerscheZahl: i would suggest: you only have to visit 5 cities of a country (arbitrary number, can be changed per country)
 eulerscheZahl: so you don't visit all nodes
 eulerscheZahl: then i see absolutely no way to just throw standard solvers at it
 Astrobytes: OK. And what about connections between cities, fully connected?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, why not
 Astrobytes: just wondering aloud
 Astrobytes: And input size?
 eulerscheZahl: 300 might even be ok then but 500-1000 won't hurt
 eulerscheZahl: and i see a lot of potential on the visualization with the countries+cities
 DethHarmonik: Oy there. What's the drama about?&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: ok, now how to go about getting it changed
 eulerscheZahl: forum post explaining the problem and suggesting solutions?
 eulerscheZahl: or heavy downvoting to get it garbage-collected. but that would be the nuclear option
 Astrobytes: Forum first, yes
 eulerscheZahl: DomiKo was there first
 DomiKo: :sunglasses:
 eulerscheZahl: hey DethHarmonik. about <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7995ef6dfd1604a148a65cea9ee95de1e1da">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7995ef6dfd1604a148a65cea9ee95de1e1da</a>
 eulerscheZahl: approved and easy to get the perfect score with an online solver
 eulerscheZahl: that is if you ask for the shortest route. currently it's about the longest. still possible with concorde but some heurisitcs can't be applied
 DethHarmonik: Hm. Just reading the title and the tags I see like a problem...
 eulerscheZahl: read my comment. took me 10min to solve and hardcode all validators.
 struct: it took me less to open and close it
 DethHarmonik: Statement seems strange too...&#160;:/
 DomiKo: you are right
 DethHarmonik: Oh you posted about it DomiKo ^^ Sorry I arrive after the battle :p
 Astrobytes: OK, how's that post?
 AMMARBelbaz: .
 Astrobytes: edited to mention prevention of bruteforced solutions/online solvers
 eulerscheZahl: now i'll break my 1 month forum inactivity streak to &lt;3 you
 Astrobytes: heh heh, thanks
 eulerscheZahl: n=3 cities (shortest route) before moving to the next city.
 eulerscheZahl: to the next country
 eulerscheZahl: and n is reserved for other purposes already
 Astrobytes: both fixed
 DomiKo: that's a nice post Astro
 eulerscheZahl: java_coffee_cup that optimization for the longest path is probably a bug. you don't see it while it's pending
 Astrobytes: just repeating what we just discussed here DomiKo, albeit a little more coherent :D
 DethHarmonik: How was the Quora thing btw eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: huge failure from my side
 eulerscheZahl: and tourist won, surprise
 java_coffee_cup: indeed didn't notice it out while pending
 DethHarmonik: That's the difference between a person who does it to eat and one who does it for fun I suppose.&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: one would have to check the config.inii always had to think twice myself when I created an optim
 Astrobytes: java_coffee_cup: what do you make of our proposed solution?
 eulerscheZahl: have you seen that competitive programming hall of fame project?
 Astrobytes: a shrine to tourist?!
 eulerscheZahl: tourist won about $350k of prize money just in onsite-finals
 Astrobytes: yeah I've seen that 
 eulerscheZahl: the $3k from quora are online, not even listed
 java_coffee_cup: Interesting suggestion to make sub-nodes. 
 eulerscheZahl: whatever it takes to enforce re-thinking
 java_coffee_cup: The current setting is the very standard TSP which solution can be found easily online
 Astrobytes: It was my first thought after dapora n mentioned the issue last night. Without over-complicating the whole thing too much
 eulerscheZahl: and i can already see the map with country borders and cities in my mind
 DomiKo: tourist is winning almost everything he participated in since 7 years old so for sure he made many millions
 Astrobytes: Indeed.
 eulerscheZahl: one in the US with state borders
 eulerscheZahl: Europe with all that tiny countries
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if we speak about millions yet. but very impressive
 Astrobytes: hm, there are only 295 countries
 Astrobytes: *195
 eulerscheZahl: but lots of cities per country
 Astrobytes: (close only out by 100)
 Astrobytes: true
 eulerscheZahl: you don't even have to enforce the same about of cities visited per country
 Astrobytes: regarding shortest path?
 eulerscheZahl: if you are really dedicated, you can even download a list of cities to make the level design more realistic
 Astrobytes: or number?
 eulerscheZahl: let's say you have 3 countries with 4,7,10 cities in it. and the expected solution wants 2,6,4 visited cities of those
 Astrobytes: list of cities wouldn't be so difficult to do, you could even use real distances
 Astrobytes: Yes, go on
 eulerscheZahl: net challenge: get google maps into the CG viewer :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: next*
 Astrobytes: oh I get you, not the same k visits for each country
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 Astrobytes: Post edited.
 eulerscheZahl: did you ever mention the main issue by name?
 eulerscheZahl: not everyone has access to the discussion after approval
 Astrobytes: well I linked the contribution
 Astrobytes: hm, true, Let me edit
 eulerscheZahl: i like how you still have the 5% behind your name
 Astrobytes: :grin:
 Astrobytes: OK, post edited.
 eulerscheZahl:&#160;:+1:
 dmuraco: how to debug in python?
 Astrobytes: check the starter code
 Astrobytes: it's written in a comment
 eulerscheZahl: you can't set breakpoints and step through line by line
 Astrobytes: unless you run an offline version of your code of course
 dmuraco: sys.stderr.write()

 DomiKo: Scarfield my reaction was similiar xd
 Scarfield: yea its so bad its funny tbh
 eulerscheZahl: there's a long forum post about the game already
 Scarfield: yea i saw you chatting about it, checked it out, and the rules where just perfect, had to share&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: usually i scan through those generic parts without reading all of it. only noticed when i was looking for a definition of the distance
 eulerscheZahl: a real gem of comedy
 Scarfield: its really a reverse optim
 jacek: there is other graph based game if youre interested *wink* *wink*
 eulerscheZahl: a pessim
 eulerscheZahl: paper soccer?
 jacek: i didnt say it :no_mouth:
 struct: is it safe to do seed&#160;% number of positions?
 struct: or should I use random(number of positions?
 eulerscheZahl: both will do
 struct: thanks
 eulerscheZahl: seeds are so large that there is no notable bias
 ElectricToothpaste: hi guys im new here
 Dark_Hack: eulerscheZahl i have a qusetion for you
 DethHarmonik: Hello new here o/
 Dark_Hack: are you admin or owner&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: no, just a normal user
 Dark_Hack: what
 eulerscheZahl: not even a chat moderator. reach level 29 and you have the same powers as I do
 Dark_Hack: i just saw you year ago 
 Dark_Hack: how 
 eulerscheZahl: i used to be a moderator (not staff) but decided to resign
 Dark_Hack: do  the owner know about you 
 Dark_Hack: or what?
 eulerscheZahl: no idea. the community manager does
 Dark_Hack: i just want to see you as manager or moderator 
 eulerscheZahl: those days are over, i'm rarely active anymore
 Dark_Hack: i just lov your Bender
 Dark_Hack: love
 Astrobytes: Intriguing fantasy you have there Dark_Hack
 Dark_Hack:&#160;?
 Astrobytes: Dark_Hack 05:04PMi just want to see you as manager or moderator 
 eulerscheZahl: i would be a horrible manager
 eulerscheZahl: i can code. but delegating stuff? nope
 Dark_Hack: hey yo 
 Dark_Hack: bro dint worry i sad just what i want 
 Dark_Hack: don't*
 Dark_Hack: i know that it is impossible 
 Astrobytes: Yeah I just find it an intriguing idea :D
 eulerscheZahl: not completely impossible. i'd just have to take the regular hiring process
 Dark_Hack: you are moderator or what?
 Astrobytes: He used to be, so did I, and a few others
 eulerscheZahl: long story
 Astrobytes: But that's history.
 Dark_Hack: i asked about you Astrobytes 
 eulerscheZahl: looking forward to the next contest, i just hope it won't collide with topcoder
 Astrobytes: Dark_Hack: I used to be, see my comment a few posts before this
 Dark_Hack: yes but i ask 
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-the-statement">https://www.codingame.com/learn/reading-the-statement</a>
 Dark_Hack: eulerscheZahl
 Dark_Hack: do you know MadKnight
 Dark_Hack:&#160;?
 Dark_Hack: and where is he now&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: only from chatting and a short voice call
 eulerscheZahl: and no idea on your 2nd question about him
 Dark_Hack: thk
 Dark_Hack: the system of getting points changed?
 Dark_Hack: or what
 eulerscheZahl: not recently
 dbf: eulerscheZahl are you going to participate in hashcode?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: with Illeda n and Neuman nand dbdr if he reads our messages
 dbf: wow, quite a strong team!
 eulerscheZahl: not that strong for 4h contests. all of us would do better with more time i think
 eulerscheZahl: we participated last year as well. team DEIN
 eulerscheZahl: d = dbdr, e = eulerscheZahl, ...you get the idea
 eulerscheZahl: will you play?
 dbf: yes
 eulerscheZahl: do i know your team members?
 dbf: oreshnik is in your 'Following' list&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh yes, I know her
 dbf: last year result was around 2000, maybe it will be better this time :joy:
 eulerscheZahl: would have been similar for us, Neuman n saved us
 eulerscheZahl: just checked the leaderboard. we were 78th. better than i remembered
 Astrobytes: impressive
 eulerscheZahl: i felt so useless :D
 DomiKo: HashCode is scam
 Astrobytes: lol, this is why you build a strong team
 dbf: 78 is nice, my best was around ~350 but still was not good to get into finals?
 eulerscheZahl: highest ranked team with 4 different nations
 eulerscheZahl: top 40 or 50 go to finals, i don't even know
 Astrobytes: DomiKo: how so?
 DomiKo: eulerscheZahl  around 40
 eulerscheZahl: 38 teams on the leaderboard of the finals
 DomiKo: Astrobytes: in short. You got nothing if you are not on the podium.
 Astrobytes: Ah I see, yes, that's a little harsh
 eulerscheZahl: so you were on-site in the finals?
 DomiKo: me? no
 DomiKo: my friends were, but final was online
 eulerscheZahl: ah
 eulerscheZahl: not even some swag like stickers or tshirts?
 dbf: or even fast-line google interview?&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: lol
 DomiKo: they didn't even get the prizes, because of problem with customs
 eulerscheZahl: oh, story of my last RAIC
 DomiKo: dbf: dont even dream about it
 Astrobytes: like you with Russian prizes euler
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020554RU">https://www.pochta.ru/tracking#RR148020554RU</a>

 eulerscheZahl: or me with topcoder tshirt supposedly (i don't have a tracking link but didn't receive anything)
 DomiKo: HashCode only display then your team name, so you don't have any confirmation that you was at finals
 dbf: oh, poor t-shirt
 DomiKo: euler: my best was 6th at waitlist in 2019&#160;:( 
 eulerscheZahl: and hoodie&#160;:(
 dbf: I got hoodie and it colored my t-shirt, lol
 Astrobytes: Yeah, that's pretty crappy DomiKo
 Astrobytes: You would think Google would make a bit more effort to recognise strong competitors
 DomiKo: But still, it's a pretty fun contest. But in terms of prizes big scam.
 DomiKo: yeah Google is BIG name, so contest should be ...
 dbf: eulerscheZahl, but it was not a problem with customs in your case, they were not able to deliver?
 eulerscheZahl: i've read that topcoder paid $1k to finalists as finals weren't onsite
 eulerscheZahl: customs blocked it
 eulerscheZahl: and didn't even inform me. i only realized when it was too late to even ask what's wrong
 dbf: hm, weird
 eulerscheZahl: "Retained by customs in Germany"
 eulerscheZahl: screw them!
 eulerscheZahl: i know that a law changed less than a year ago
 eulerscheZahl: in the past you could import stuff with a value below 22 Euro(?)
 eulerscheZahl: now you have to pay taxes on everything. so the sender has to add a prize tag
 eulerscheZahl: maybe that's what was missing. i have no idea
 DomiKo: In my friend's case problem was that customs didn't have any confirmation that that was a prize, so they had to pay for it. A hoodie is a bit pricey.
 eulerscheZahl: i even would have paid. but never had a choice
 Astrobytes: a friend of mine in Brazil had a similar issue with a t-shirt gift recently
 dbf: ah, I see. we had 1k euro limit earlier, that was lowered to 200 euro
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: In the US we have open borders, no problems shipping stuff
 Astrobytes: and that was a t-shirt sent from the US to Brazil
 DomiKo: only problem with US is shipping&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: but that would be too easy. in germany we love paragraphs
 Astrobytes: lol
 eulerscheZahl: i even sent a mail to RAIC organizers if there's still a chance to receive it. but i don't expect a response
 dbf: btw, I don't like design of hoodie - it is about space, but game was about knights and archers&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: depends if you use the debug view
 eulerscheZahl: illedan said it looks cool. haven't seen it myself
 dbf: he was the only one who used it I think&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I like the t-shirt, in fact I'm wearing it now
 DomiKo: Flex
 eulerscheZahl: dbf just tried to cheer me up
 Astrobytes: lol, hardly DomiKo :rofl:
 RajdeepBiswas: lets goooo
 eulerscheZahl: astro got a t-shirt and knows that i won a hoodie on top. not flexing
 RajdeepBiswas: any team looking for a guy?
 RajdeepBiswas: i'm up
 RajdeepBiswas: for hire :P
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Are you the famous Rajdeep Biswas we all know from github?
 eulerscheZahl: "I am a musician turned programmer.(Also, a metalhead!)."
 eulerscheZahl: afk for dinner
 Astrobytes: 'methhead' :rofl:
 wlesavo: Astrobytes i am wearing hoodie on top of t-shirt :smiley:
 RajdeepBiswas: @MrsGloryhole, probably not xD
 Astrobytes: wlesavo: now *that's* a flex! :D
 dbf: poor wlesavo, it is quite cold around?&#160;:)
 wlesavo: just come home :slight_smile:
 Astrobytes: I need a hoodie, the heating is broken in my house currently
 dbf: Astrobytes, raic-2021 is coming!
 wlesavo: raic soon, you will only have to win and wait another year :smiley:
 Astrobytes: indeed :D hahaha
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: that guy just called me a gloryhole
 dbf: but you will prepared if your heating will be broken in 2023
 Astrobytes: dbf: very true, it pays to plan ahead!

 leojean890: Hy Astrobytes how is ur reversed_travelling-salesman :p
 Astrobytes: leojean890: I've posted a proposed amendment in the forum
 leojean890: so you prefer this version or reversing back&#160;?:P
 leojean890: I'll look that^^
 Astrobytes: It's a larger issue than simply being reversed tbh
 RajdeepBiswas: do you guys know anyone that works at openai?
 leojean890: I agree, validators with input size to 500 - 1000 countries/nodes would be more interesting&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: No. But an oldschool user from here works at Deepmind
 RajdeepBiswas: will you be able to help me with their userame please?
 Astrobytes: inoryy
 Astrobytes: He's not online here much nowadays.
 jacek: working on bioengineering cat girls
 RajdeepBiswas: sweet, thanks anyway!
 Astrobytes: He had a blog, maybe you can reach him there.
 leojean890: for me I was ok with the size 300 to begin working on it, but to make the challenge more fun for all, and for a long time, bigger size is widely more interesting!
 RajdeepBiswas: I just happened to find that via his profile, yes
 Astrobytes: Not just bigger size, but each node is a group of sub-nodes
 leojean890: but I'm not very used on working on this precise problem for now, tried to create a first node with greedy and go on with some hill climbing or SA
 Astrobytes: This will prevent the use of existing TSP solvers and bruteforcing
 leojean890: and euler gave me other ideas like Hamilton path I didn't know before
 leojean890: yes I know, maybe the leaderboard will be fooled by some cheaters :p
 eulerscheZahl: i even think that the reversed TSP is harder to solve than the intended one
 Astrobytes: shouldn't have approved following eulers comment though. 
 Astrobytes: And I should have moved to reject pending more investigation so partially my fault too.
 leojean890: but it's still a way to improve and train.. but I won't be against if bigger validators are given&#160;:)
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: the moderation bot will take care of it
 Astrobytes: last resort
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I wonder what happens if sentence tokenizer gets approved again
 leojean890: but I prefer to have that than no TSP optim here^^
 leojean890: so.. hopefully if it's thrown away it will come back with better validators
 eulerscheZahl: it's not the testcases/validators. 1000 nodes won't change anything
 Astrobytes: @Mrs um, Gloryhole? If it reappears in the Contribs it'll be derided until removed. That's the usual process for repeated re-uploads
 eulerscheZahl: it's the game rules that shouldn't be vanilla TSP
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: heh heh. well he already submitted it again
 jacek: oO
 Astrobytes: lol, derision incoming
 eulerscheZahl: what did i miss in the last weeks?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I had a deleted clash get reapproved, turns out you don't get xp the 2nd time
 eulerscheZahl: like when you promote to the same league again
 eulerscheZahl: when CG opens it early by accident
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: about the only thing you missed is wont turning from a guy who never kicks into a ban machine
 eulerscheZahl: and I never good XP for the lowest wood league at OoC
 eulerscheZahl: wonto found the ban command? :o
 leojean890: about TSP, I think that I don't know enough the original topic so maybe I don't see everything you see which are bad
 leojean890: in this contrib
 Astrobytes: leojean890: it was initially pointed out to myself and darkhorse64 by daporan last night
 Astrobytes: then euler elaborated some more this morning
 eulerscheZahl: and i read the chat logs this morning, found the puzzle and agreed with daporan
 eulerscheZahl: then decided to rant
 Astrobytes: Not a rant per se, was a very helpful comment.
 eulerscheZahl: never hurt to have a bit of theoretical background (though i don't know all the details of how it works)
 leojean890: but me I was happy to have a new toy to play with xD
 eulerscheZahl: some simplex solver involved
 leojean890: I missed new optims, I did something on all other ^^
 leojean890: except CG funge prime
 Astrobytes: Yeah, as I said in chat last night, I'd like to learn a bit more graph theory tbh
 eulerscheZahl: CG Funge isn't a classic optim so that's fine
 leojean890: same :P
 Astrobytes: hm, that spreading fire optim is still in contribs
 leojean890: what do you think of it&#160;? didn't try yet&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I've not tried it, I just remembered it from some time ago
 leojean890:  but it may be interesting, 
 struct: ups forgot seed can be negative&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: personally i would have taken random.next() without even considering your way
 struct: is just to make seed 0 = empty board
 struct: and so on 
 eulerscheZahl: just feels cleaner from a software engineering point for me, i can't really reason it
 eulerscheZahl: i see. topcoder always hardcodes the parameters on seed 1 and 2
 eulerscheZahl: and i still haven't looked into the game you want to create
 struct: probably just another mcts game
 struct: dominated by NNs
 eulerscheZahl: :tada:
 struct: by jacek*
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: man, if you turn on the olympics in the US the broadcasters basically tell you not to watch it
 struct: why?
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: politics
 eulerscheZahl: until just now i completely forgot about the olympics again
 eulerscheZahl: and probably i'll forget it until tomorrow
 struct: not a big fan of winter olympics
 eulerscheZahl: not a big fan of watching others do sports

 struct: lol
 struct: is this new?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/anim-module">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/anim-module</a>
 struct: I never saw it before
 eulerscheZahl: community contribution by butanium
 eulerscheZahl: you can make pull requests with your own modules
 jacek: did he publish his contribution?
 eulerscheZahl: oh wait, i think i confused it
 struct: repo seems to be 4 years old maybe its not new
 struct: I just cant remember it seeing it before
 ProCrazyCoder: print("Hello people")
 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: how shall i know if butaniums game is still WIP? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/bMlOJF8.png">https://i.imgur.com/bMlOJF8.png</a>
 jacek: and he renamed it from clash of bots to somehting else
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: Hi
 struct: hi
 jacek: hm?
 struct: I was sending an empty string and messing up stdin on java
 struct: and wasnt finding what was wrong
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: How is Code Keeper a multiplayer game?
 jacek: and quite polished
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: Yeah, but I wonder how you interact with the other players
 DomiKo: you don't
 jacek: i think the same question people asked during contribution
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: So it is basically a puzzle?
 jacek: approvers these days...
 DomiKo: :sweat_smile:
 jacek: this could be baasically an optim
 DomiKo: This could be in future
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: Ok, I'll try something else.
 jacek: :notebook: :soccer:
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: hm?
 jacek: nevermind
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: The game made by you? Paper Soccer?
 DomiKo: you have to try paper soccer it's super fun game
 Scarfield: have you had a branding course, you really have been pushing paper soccer today xD
 jacek: really?
 jacek: oh my
 struct: I dont know if I should player output multiple moves or force opponent to pass and make the player go again
 struct: the first one is probably harder for newbies
 jacek: can you make it like othello?
 struct: currently is like othello
 Scarfield: which game did you end up porting, ataxx?
 struct: yes
 struct: i should do backgammon next
 Scarfield: kewl
 struct: since its different
 Scarfield: nice
 struct: no idea how to make an ai for it
 Wontonimo: rand()
 Wontonimo: done
 jacek: eh <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node108.html">http://incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node108.html</a>
 struct: I see RL I close
 jacek: real life?
 struct: yes
 Wontonimo: it looks like 1-hots again 
 struct: im more interested in backgammon since I dont think I will be able to use mcts there
 jacek: and has random element
 Wontonimo: why would MCTS not work?
 Scarfield: there are some basic heuristics you can use, "bridge" having more than 1 piece on more positions in a row is good. Having a single piece on a position is bad. 
 struct: it might but i have no idea how to code an eval for this game
 jacek: plot twist: mcts doesnt need eval
 Wontonimo: win = 1 , lose = -1
 struct: there are so many combinations possible
 struct: if you take into account all rolls possible
 Wontonimo: i still haven't upgraded my mcts solver to deal with ties
 struct: brb
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: i think the stochastic nature of MCTS will just take care of probabilities naturally 
 Wontonimo: oO - what I mean jacek is that it doesn't solve for a tie in the same way it will solve for a win/lose.  A tie isn't treated as a solvable end state, but just like another value
 jacek: draws can tricky, especially in selection
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: "The typical size of pitch is 8x10"
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: Not really typical if it is a hard fact?
 jacek: approvers didn't complain :v
 Mr.WhiskeyPerson: How typical of them
 jacek: yes, its hardcoded for CG

 Wontonimo: who doesn't make 12 tacos at a time?
 DethHarmonik: Hmm...
 Astrobytes: 12? Rookie numbers
 Wontonimo: lol
 Wontonimo: well, now we have a taco-based reputation system 
 DethHarmonik: I see you created a bot who send messages to prevent clash link spam, but favorise tacos spam...
 Astrobytes: haha, perhaps it should have a finite supply of tacos
 str_name: anyone wanna play smash bros?
 Wontonimo: i'll be very happy when Automaton2000 awards someone a taco
 Automaton2000: i will add it to the teacher
 Astrobytes: oO
 jacek: :upside_down:
 Wontonimo: if it get's out of hand and becomes spam, let me know and I'll disable it for a while.
 Astrobytes: will do
 DethHarmonik: tacocurrency
 Majeck: Hullo
 Majeck: What exactly are "events"?
 Majeck: I read the description, but what's the difference between for example a regular Clash of Code and registering for 14th Feb's CoC?
 Wontonimo: promotion of things that are already happening
 Wontonimo: but they want all users to focus on that one thing
 Wontonimo: because it is actually really fun when everyone talks and works on the same thing
 Majeck: Ohhhh, so like main chat focusing on it and so
 Majeck: That's awesome!
 Wontonimo: yeah
 Wontonimo: that's my 0.02
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: and wonto can tell the clash guys they are wasting their lives
 Astrobytes: :D
 DethHarmonik: And give them tacos
 Wontonimo: NO TACOS FOR CLASH&#160;!
 Astrobytes: Make tacos not clashes :peace:

 cyberblitz_: I'm getting the feeling the group who have created Codingame don't have English as their first language. Some of the English is not that great

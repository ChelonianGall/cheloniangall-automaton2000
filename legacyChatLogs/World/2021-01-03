 BrainWart: pasting?
 Chromicquanta: hh
 Algod: what is people(not in clash) can watch a clash see others coding . it will be enjoyable. in binarysearch.io i saw something similar,
 eulerscheZahl: some users are streaming if that's what you mean
 BrainWart: r u
 mrbossosity: hey guys
 Q12: If the current ratio between the number of contributions approved in one day and the number of contributions added in one day, will continue, we will be flooded with contributions.
 eulerscheZahl: I know i've shared this before:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/">http://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/stats/</a>
 Q12: Nice! but sad :slight_frown:
 jacek: at least its getting popular
 Q12: yeah, but when users will see their contribution does not approved because there is too many contributions the popularity of the contributions will decrease.
 Q12: *does not get
 jacek: then there will be less clash contributions. profits
 eulerscheZahl: and the few interesting ones have to much harder to even get noticed on that page with 100+ contributions
 eulerscheZahl: also after approval: a huge page with puzzles, most recent ones shown first
 Q12: @eulerscheZahlYeah, this is the big problem here
 eulerscheZahl: IMO it would be better to sort my some mix of newest and highest rated
 eulerscheZahl: sort by*
 Q12: Wow
 Q12: I totally agree
 Q12: @jacek One good side of this :slight_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: like: give every puzzle 5 5-star ratings, then compute the average score
 eulerscheZahl: that way new contribs with no other ratings would show first
 eulerscheZahl: and then the rating matters
 Q12: Why don't use the upvotes and downvotes that already exist as sort of rating?
 eulerscheZahl: we are talking about 2 things: approved and pending
 eulerscheZahl: for the pending ones it was sorted by upvotes/downvotes long ago
 eulerscheZahl: then the number on pending got larger and larger (a bit over 100)
 eulerscheZahl: CG added a timer to close it after 30 days. and changed the sorting in that process
 eulerscheZahl: which was not a big deal as there were 15-20 contribs pending at the same time
 eulerscheZahl: then WIP became a 3rd option (after private and public). so puzzles could stay there for longer
 eulerscheZahl: and then the quest map. you know that part of the story
 Q12: yeah, I understand know
 eulerscheZahl: and now we are back to the &gt; 100 that made CG take action and add the 30 day timer
 Q12: *now
 Q12: Maybe they can also do that if a contribution have a very bad rating it will be rejected.
 eulerscheZahl: hm, currently there are 120 contributions in the list. 20 have a negative rating. the lowest is -6
 eulerscheZahl: wouldn't filter much
 suckit: hey how to check if 2 strings are equal in c++?
 eulerscheZahl: == should work, doesn't it?
 suckit: its showing error
 Q12: yeah I agree, but once I see -34 to a contribution. I think it will help a bit to deal with very bad contributions.
 eulerscheZahl: in the end only CG can change it. not sure if it's a priority&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: personally i mostly stopped checking pending contributions as the spam turned me off
 Q12: Because of the number of contributions and that contributions with difficulty hard and above didn't get notice I decided to focus just on  contributions with difficulty hard and above in the contributions page.
 eulerscheZahl: that's one way to deal with it
 eulerscheZahl: maybe i should write my own script to filter
 eulerscheZahl: tampermonkey or such
 Q12: nice, I think you should suggest your idea to the stuff in the forum.
 eulerscheZahl: staff?
 Q12: yeah :sweat_smile:
 eulerscheZahl: we can already filter by type to remove the clashes from the list
 Q12: yeah, this is very helpful. But I talked about your rating idea.
 eulerscheZahl: for approved puzzles, I see.advantage: new users get to see the supposedly good parts and not be turned off by whatever just got approved
 eulerscheZahl: CG likes new users, so I think it's a good argument
 Q12: your idea will also help to welcome to the website the best puzzles.
 jacek: euler is essentially from CG staff, why he isnt being listened to
 wizcoin: does this platform teach you to code?
 eulerscheZahl: it helps you to improve if you have some basic level already
 wizcoin: thought it was going to teach me how to code
 jacek: not the very basics
 eulerscheZahl: you should know the basics (if-else, loops, arrays) to make this website enjoyable
 wizcoin: this place is hard
 BrainWart: yes
 eulerscheZahl: learn some basics (e.g. youtube search for "introduction &lt;your programming language&gt;")
 BrainWart: python is a good all-rounder for here
 eulerscheZahl: then come back after you understood those. CG isn't holding your hand to guide you too much
 wizcoin: im studying computer science at my school
 wizcoin: gonna start programming this year
 proogrmr: nice
 BrainWart: good luck! programming is hard but, fun if you like that kinda thing
 wizcoin: programming is hard
 proogrmr: programming is fun :p
 proogrmr: our motto
 wizcoin: i wish it involves titties lol
 wizcoin: but sadly no
 wizcoin: would be even more fun
 eulerscheZahl: for me learning how to code had some similarities with learning English.At first i struggled with everything: grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation. at some point it gets easier to improve
 wizcoin: coding isn't in german?
 Ashen_024: coding in german?? ?_?
 eulerscheZahl: what I mean: you have to learn some grammar/vocabulary for a programming language too.
 eulerscheZahl: there's a certain way how you have to write an if-statementlike:if (x &lt; 3) { do something here }
 eulerscheZahl: if you forget the brackets around the condition, it's not gonna work
 Ashen_024: That's true
 eulerscheZahl: and initially you take a long time to write the simplest code (or say the simplest sentences in a spoken language). and you may get frustrated and feel stupid.
 eulerscheZahl: but the longer you try, the easier it will get
 jacek: coding in german :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: today's students do that. i was lucky enough not to work with it.<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOvT0bPWs_w&amp;ab_channel=StefanSiegmund-Schultze">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOvT0bPWs_w&amp;ab_channel=StefanSiegmund-Schultze</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Robot Karol
 Ashen_024: Yehp, I remember the first time i learned for loop, my guide/mentor taught me it through English= For first;until;using 
 Ashen_024: being a non-native english speaker it was hard at first yehp
 MSmits: morning
 wizcoin: so everyone else has to code in english?
 jacek: brainfuck isnt english, is it
 jacek: MSmits hows the balance going?
 proogrmr: morning ;p
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea611851-6078-4f2e-b378-2a4c3c6702e6">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ea611851-6078-4f2e-b378-2a4c3c6702e6</a>
 MSmits: seems pretty obvious to me this game needs steal
 MSmits: doesn't need 1M games to tell
 jacek: you may never know
 jacek: time for crowdfunding
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: thing is steal cant hurt, beyond the slight inconvience of coding it. It can never make a game *less* balanced
 wizcoin: coding  in german is whack?
 MSmits: schmetterling!
 wizcoin: what!?
 JBM: lol
 MSmits: just a meme :P
 eulerscheZahl: Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz
 MSmits: nice euler

 MSmits: isn't there a law that says no more than one umlaut in  a word
 eulerscheZahl: do you know what hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia is?
 wizcoin: yeah
 wizcoin: a word
 MSmits: sounds like you're afraid of hippo's on bicycles
 eulerscheZahl: the fear of long words :D
 MSmits: ah, close
 wizcoin: who loves java?
 SPDene: it's good job you're not german or dutch, tehn - they have a habit of joining all their words together ( big /s )
 eulerscheZahl: Dutch too?
 wizcoin: oooo
 eulerscheZahl: i prefer C# over Java. Somewhat similar but more convenient
 wizcoin: i used to love c#
 wizcoin: but im gonna learn java in school so im practicing
 SPDene: 'Dutch, like many Germanic languages, is capable of forming compounds of potentially limitless length. The 53-letter word Kinder­carnavals­optocht­voorbereidings­werkzaamheden­plan, meaning "preparation activities plan for a children's carnival procession"'
 proogrmr: :scream:
 wizcoin: what can you do in c#?
 jacek: not to wear glasses
 SPDene: verry f^Hpunny
 MSmits: hehe yes we do this too
 eulerscheZahl: C# is turing complete. if you can code it, you can do it in C#
 wizcoin: what is turing complete?
 eulerscheZahl: it means that you can express all the possible logic in code. basically you only need 2 things to achieve that: conditionals and branches
 wizcoin: then aren't all languages turing complete?
 MSmits: it's not a programming language if it is not
 jacek: is html turing complete?
 eulerscheZahl: programming languages: yes
 eulerscheZahl: HTML is a markup langauge: no
 ChampionCoder: I have an error in "Don't Panic! - Episode 1": when I try to use the variable "elevator_pos", it says that it is not defined
 ChampionCoder: Can someone help me out?
 eulerscheZahl: but html5+css has been proving to be turing complete
 ChampionCoder: I'm using Python3, bytue way
 ChampionCoder: *By the
 MSmits: only when combined
 MSmits: html alone isnt right?
 eulerscheZahl: right
 wizcoin: what have you done in c#?
 eulerscheZahl: and there are still some things that are impossible to code
 eulerscheZahl: let's say you have to write a program. you get the code of another program as an input
 eulerscheZahl: and your task is to tell if the other program has in infinite loop
 eulerscheZahl: it's been proven that this is impossible to tell in general
 MSmits: you mean the output
 wizcoin: the halting problem
 wizcoin: yeah yeah we know
 eulerscheZahl: exactly&#160;:)
 wizcoin: all I wanna know is what do you know to do in C#?
 MSmits: he can do anything he tries, in C#
 eulerscheZahl: here are lots of puzzles on CodinGame. you can do all of them in C#
 eulerscheZahl: (except Nintendo, CG only allows C++ there)
 darkhorse64: re C4 and regarding balance testing, I think steal is overkill. Just say that, first turn, only 0 and 8 are allowed legal moves. Minimal changes for the game designer and for the bot. 
 wizcoin: have you ever made an android application using C#?
 MSmits: hmm this is fine with me, except that for this, you need to be absolutely sure that move 0 is the most balanced move, as opposed to 1 or 2
 MSmits: for steal, you dont
 MSmits: i would want to get way more games in my meta mcts to be sure
 MSmits: the current amount is enough to show it's not balanced, but not enough to show which starting move is
 darkhorse64: I agree that for Y steal is needed. Yeah, I am relying on your tests
 eulerscheZahl: personally I haven't. but there's Xamarin for Android development with C#
 eulerscheZahl: ask Illedan, he still wants to finish the Number Shifting app :rage:
 wizcoin: so what applications have you made with it?
 MSmits: also, i kinda like the extra dimension that steal adds to Y
 eulerscheZahl: mostly smaller personal stuff (like bots here on CG).and some applications for my employer. Windows Desktop
 wizcoin: cool
 wizcoin: you work?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 wizcoin: nice
 wizcoin: how old r u?
 eulerscheZahl: most of us here are old in your eyes
 eulerscheZahl: 29
 jacek: have heard of xamarin, my colleagues tried it in half-serious apps
 SPDene: rofl. most people here are young in my eyes
 wizcoin: im 17 lol gonna be 18 in a month
 MSmits: me, 40 in a month 
 SPDene: I started coding over 40 years ago
 jacek: :older_man:
 jacek: on mechanical computers?
 eulerscheZahl: back when the callstack wasn't invented yet
 SPDene: not quiet jacek: on a commadore pet
 wizcoin: who here has used punched cards?
 SPDene: me
 wizcoin: wow
 wizcoin: thats cool
 eulerscheZahl: my dad could tell stories about that too
 eulerscheZahl: and they had staff to convert the code to those cards
 wizcoin: how was apple back in the day than now?
 eulerscheZahl: so when a bug occurred, the first question was: your fault or something wrong in that conversion to punch cards?
 JBM: "compiler errors"
 ChampionCoder: Apparently there is an 18 years restriction on the competitions
 JBM: just don't tell them your age
 ChampionCoder: :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: I think it's probably due to laws in some countries
 wizcoin: next level programming is going to be graphical 4 sure
 wizcoin: visual programming
 MSmits: what do you mean
 MSmits: I doubt that
 wizcoin: even unity is implementing it
 jacek: gui?
 MSmits: well it's nice for beginning coders
 JBM: it's been the next level for at least 40 years
 JBM: a bit slow to take off
 wizcoin: its even in unreal engine
 wizcoin: and godot
 eulerscheZahl: ChampionCoder 11:00AMApparently there is an 18 years restriction on the competitions
 eulerscheZahl: no one checks this. i guess they have to write it for legal reasons
 eulerscheZahl: if you want to compete in a contest, just do it
 ChampionCoder: yeah
 wizcoin: cant wait for neuralink
 MSmits: at worst they will deny you your t-shirt if you advertise your age
 wizcoin: ill be the best coder in house
 MSmits: but your mom buys your clothes so thats fine
 MSmits: euler has to buy his own clothes
 wizcoin: just download the learning algorithm
 MSmits: thats why he's usually top 20
 Zorg1: :D
 eulerscheZahl: you revealed my secret motivation for the community contest
 MSmits: oops
 eulerscheZahl: now i have to plot a new evil thing
 MSmits: you can do it
 MSmits: just make a new long word
 wizcoin: shrodinger
 MSmits: you missspelled that two ways
 MSmits: and you're annoying the Germans much less than the physicist community :P
 wizcoin: lol
 wizcoin: i want to be a master programmer
 SPDene: hmm.   no capital S, no c, no ö. which one did you ignore MSmits&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: S
 ChampionCoder: yeah mostly that
 SPDene: i thought so too
 ChampionCoder: :sweat_smile:
 wizcoin: is everyone german here?
 JBM: more or less
 ChampionCoder: No
 wizcoin: wow
 SPDene: not me
 wizcoin: good english skillds
 SPDene: hover over someone's icon to see their location - which is likely what nationality they are
 SPDene: ... or an indication of VPN use :P
 JBM: it's self-selected
 JBM: vpn won't change much
 MSmits: SPDene the capital
 MSmits: wizcoin half the players on CG are French
 MSmits: the rest are from everywhere
 wizcoin: your french aren't u?
 SPDene: lol
 MSmits: no I am Dutch
 wizcoin: oh
 MSmits: dont rotate your screen before looking at my profile flag
 darkhorse64: If half of the leaderboard is french, it's only because we are strong coders :grin:
 MSmits: sure, that's the reason :P
 JBM: or just one of you is and shares his code
 ChampionCoder: yeahEven the guy who is in charge of all these messages is French
 wizcoin: then why is programming languages in english?
 wizcoin: haha
 darkhorse64: I have spent half of my bragging rights for the whole year on this one
 MSmits: the other half is for when you fix your breakthrough bot :P
 ChampionCoder: JBM lol :sweat_smile:
 MSmits: and share the code with me btw
 darkhorse64: The only thing left for me is to implement the better eval you once showed me
 MSmits: oh, i showed you a better eval? 
 MSmits: mine isnt very good though, i rank higher, so i guess it may help
 JBM: "the only thing left"
 darkhorse64: or look at n-tuples. A link to a MM bot
 JBM: those famous last words
 MSmits: ohh ok, that one
 wizcoin: elon was a coder
 MSmits: and then he stood too close to his rocket
 wizcoin: and what happened?
 MSmits: woosh
 wizcoin: mars
 MSmits: lol
 wizcoin: engine 42
 wizcoin: :computer:
 darkhorse64: &lt;=&gt;
 wizcoin: bitcoin to the moon
 wizcoin: hail satoshi

 emh: I'm doing Q-learning for Search Race
 emh: I don't have a neural network in it (at least not yet), just a huge 24-bit state table
 emh: it finds a way through the checkpoints, but is far from optimal
 emh: wondering how I can improve it
 emh: the reward is just 100 for each checkpoint. alpha 0.1, discount 0.9.
 MSmits: might be you just need to switch to a NN
 MSmits: other than that I have no idea. I've done a little q-learning with simple games, but there's limits to having everything in a huge table
 emh: ohh ok
 MSmits: 24 bit is a lot btw
 MSmits: how do you get this into CG?
 emh: I don't
 emh: was planning to just run it offline
 emh: as validators are known
 MSmits: ahh ok, thats right i forgot
 emh: my current submit is a GA. rank 31 out of 353. ~12k vs best ~10k
 emh: online
 emh: what NN do you recommend for C++?
 darkhorse64: Same for me. I don't know what the best you can reach online
 MSmits: darkhorse64

 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d72d59bd-0777-4661-afab-7f7ea6bee645">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/d72d59bd-0777-4661-afab-7f7ea6bee645</a>
 MSmits: principal variation so far
 MSmits: stacking :P
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: for the 4th move, stacking more is 2nd best currently. wouldnt be surprised if that changes and the game ends up being a stackfest :P
 jacek: why not center eh
 MSmits: no idea, but both darkhorse64's bot and my bot play this move on their own
 jacek: could be like Y, center is best but my meta mcts always start with 3 2 being ebtter
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits:  3 2 has a problem that it appears much better than it is
 MSmits: because almost all p2 replies are solved as a loss
 MSmits: but 1 of them is really strong
 MSmits: it takes a long time to properly converge on it i think
 MSmits: these are p2's options after 3 2 start
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb7c9552-ccd8-48ad-ba2a-20533f130e32">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/eb7c9552-ccd8-48ad-ba2a-20533f130e32</a>
 MSmits: i dont think it's fair to compare that to connect 4 though, the branching is so much less, you also get more confidence with less games, or should anyway
 jacek: emh i dont use anything fancy for NN in C++. its just bunch of vectors&lt;&gt;

 darkhorse64: looking at long games, C4 is actually a stack fest when there some taboo columns (playing in them is an instant loss). The game then turns into a series of waiting moves which explains why you can sometimes predict the outcome 20 or 25 moves before the  end
 jacek: some columns become traps eh
 darkhorse64: exactly
 MSmits: yeah thats true

 Westicles: What can I do when someone deletes my comment on a contribution?  I didn't even know a non-mod could do that
 MSmits: I can't delete it
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6016f53c73b47cf4645fc98cbc590e58dcf2?comment=37934">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/6016f53c73b47cf4645fc98cbc590e58dcf2?comment=37934</a>
 MSmits: maybe the person who owns the contribution can?
 Westicles: Somehow Stilgart whacked my response to his rejection
 MSmits: are you guys at it again
 Westicles: Apparently he is
 MSmits: is he a mod maybe?
 Stilgart: is whining all you can do&#160;?
 MSmits: :popcorn:
 Westicles: He rejected with no feedback, I gently reminded him of the rules, and he deletes my comment.  This is abuse at the highest level
 Stilgart: Not reading past comments before emit a judgement seems okay, though
 Westicles: As much as I don't want to, I'm afraid I'll have to lodge a formal complaint.  We are supposed to be a community here, not despots
 Stilgart: like I care
 MSmits: to be fair Westicles, he did give an earlier reason and rejected then. Maybe he should have stated that the same reasons hold
 MSmits: Stilgart1 day ago❌ Rejected the contribution.Comment: Underspecified and too unfair (tr -dC a-zA-Z).
 MSmits: it would help if you guys communicated without the sarcasm and accusations and kept to the facts.
 MSmits: less drama that way
 eulerscheZahl: while not compliant to CG rules, personally i can totally understand a rejection without reason at this point. this user just keeps spamming low quality clashes
 eulerscheZahl: you are supposed to solve them in 5min
 eulerscheZahl: that doesn't mean you have to create them in 5min
 Westicles: My complaint is about my comment being deleted
 eulerscheZahl: oh, missed that point. sorry
 MSmits: true, that does seem wrong, but i dont know what it said exactly
 MSmits: the tone of it, etc.
 eulerscheZahl: i saw it (don't remember the wording). didn't seem offending to me
 MSmits: allright
 eulerscheZahl: quoting thibaud from forum
 eulerscheZahl: expecting more from high level user
 eulerscheZahl: which thibaud said to westicles
 eulerscheZahl: obviously out of context but meh
 eulerscheZahl: i had a good chuckle
 MSmits: well I think it's great you guys spend time looking at the contributions. I never do. Just started with connect4 and it's a lot of work 
 Westicles: Yes, it was sage advice&#160;:)
 Westicles: Poor rockstar, now they've brigaded him and it is gone&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: well, not everyone reviews the way you do smits
 MSmits: I guess so
 Westicles: "What can I do against one user (and his obedient friends) taking revenge on me regarding rejecting contributions?"
 eulerscheZahl: even if approved, I bet the clash would be gone again soon.
 MSmits: do clashes get removed after the fact?
 eulerscheZahl: can't imagine the clash having a good enough community rating to survive for long
 MSmits: oh, the rating
 eulerscheZahl: you need a certain amount of votes. and if the rating goes below a certain score then, goodbye..
 eulerscheZahl: community bot is ruthless
 Westicles: Yeah, kind of weird with CoC since you can't monitor the status.  No feedback until it is removed
 darkhorse64: rockstar contribs were very bad
 darkhorse64: poor, I should say
 eulerscheZahl: regarding moderation and refusing low quality: either you make the creator sad by refusing or you give low quality to at least 20 players until it gets refused. for the overall experience I prefer to make the creator sad
 jacek: is this what happens with blockout :smiling_imp:
 eulerscheZahl: community bot already pushed it back to draft mode
 darkhorse64: it takes way more than five minutes to review
 eulerscheZahl: and reviewers are drowning with approx 120 pending contribs now
 Westicles: And now he deleted another!
 Westicles: Drunk with power, or just...
 MSmits: what did you say
 MSmits: it wasn't about his mother or anything right?
 Westicles: He deleted my comment. J'accuse!
 Westicles: Something like that
 jacek: sacre bleu!
 MSmits: :bird:
 MaxDiaz: I love y'all
 z64555: ah, the joy of debugging state machines. frequent "the heck is this bot doing" to keep me entertained
 eulerscheZahl: state machines are much easier to debug than a simulation and complex scoring
 eulerscheZahl: let alone a neural network
 MaxDiaz: You are all my favorite people
 z64555: having a proper debug spew certainly helps
 z64555: using only cerr is kind of limiting
 Westicles: Can somebody help with the translation for this?
 Westicles: Stilgart 09:32AMWesticles est factuellement un connard, et personne ne fait rien
 SPDene: put it into google translate, and I think you'll get a good enough idea (I don't want to repeat language like that on here)
 struct: I think I understand but my french is not great so my translation can be wrong
 eulerscheZahl: i don't speak french but i'm pretty sure google translate got the message
 darkhorse64: Westicles: please stop putting money in the machine. You are not doing any good to anybody including yourself
 z64555: just gonna... close chat while that gets sorted
 eulerscheZahl: i should follow your idea
 jacek: try deepL, machine learned trnaslator
 jacek: just like AutomatonNN
 AutomatonNN: good luck
 darkhorse64: As a native french speaker, I got it right but I do not want to comment on it. I think it is now the responsability of the community manager and we should all leave it to him
 eulerscheZahl: i agree. he'll be back on Monday
 eulerscheZahl: maybe I should close the forum thread and mention it there as well? :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: before the forum turns into a fight scene
 Westicles: It wasn't closed last time
 eulerscheZahl: and it lead to some more insults
 Westicles: It is up to you.  I'm surprised they didn't just delete it also
 eulerscheZahl: i don't want to censor and shut down a discussion. but I see it as Thibauds job to deal with it and not let it turn into a bush fire in the meantime
 eulerscheZahl: i won't delete anything unless there's a really good reason (e.g. heavy insults)
 Westicles: That looks reasonable, thanks euler
 Yuy_oshch: ey yo it's pipipoopoo check
 Maxim251: how i can do it? if( a&lt;b&lt;c&lt;a) ?This is posible? Or there is simillar idea? If not then I am forced to do it in hard way
 eulerscheZahl: a&lt;a is not possible
 MSmits: it's false
 Yuy_oshch: just pay "300 hundred bucks"
 SPDene: that's true :P
 eulerscheZahl: 300 100. is that 30000?
 SPDene: any context Maxim251&#160;? are you trying to compare multiple variable in a single statement? what language are you using?
 Maxim251: I have in game some comparision and there is C&gt;P&gt;R&gt;L&gt;S and then again S&gt;C&gt;L... so go one, ts a string and each of that letters are bigger from previouse
 Maxim251: simplyfying it is like so S&gt;C&gt;P&gt;L&gt;R&gt;L&gt;S&gt;C&gt;L&gt;P&gt;S&gt;R&gt;C
 Maxim251: That letters have different situations
 SPDene: that's not possible... because you have S &gt; S and C &gt; C and P &gt; P ....
 Maxim251: Thats not good, this way I will have very big nested statments
 Maxim251: or maybe I could use struct? Make vector, and do some easy if statment that each letter in different situation will be bigger or smaller?
 Maxim251: Question is what I need for struct, to show if S&gt;C but S&lt;P
 Westicles: If you arrange it right, in c++ you could do if(string&lt;sort(string))
 Maxim251: Yes, But I am worry about that if one time C &lt; P but C&gt;L L

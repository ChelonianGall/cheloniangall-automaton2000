 Mengshang: Hello?
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Mengshang, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 Mengshang: That is good.
 jacek: :tada:
 AshamanCooper: If you are driven this is a great place to learn to code. I started two months ago and I am 406 in the green circle comp. 
 AshamanCooper: But you still need to use more than one resource. 
 Mengshang: You are good
 Mengshang: I am Chinese.When I want to code , I must to translate:joy:
 therealbeef: the IDE supports unicode, so you could have variable and function names in chinese I suppose&#160;;-)
 rachelktyjohnson: Hi everyone! I've just come back to Codeingame after a LONG hiatus. So much has changed!
 Tien118: antiwonto, what can you do?
 jacek: right into the contest
 AshamanCooper: What has changed? that would be interesting. 
 Mengshang: Variable or function  in Chinese...  Bad thing! 
 AshamanCooper: Hard to camelCase
 Westicles: Jeez, I've got this weirdo social justice dingbat rejecting by clash three times now because kissing girls offends it
 Westicles: *my
 Clams: :laughing:
 Westicles: :tada:
 Mengshang: although my English not well,but I try my best to name function or var , class in English.You can see, there are many grammar mistake in this sentence,I am a junior high school student in China
 Mengshang: :joy:
 MSmits: these are not the same are they?
 MSmits: a = b + c? d&#160;: e; a = b + (c? d: e);
 rachelktyjohnson: the interface has changed a lot. there were a solid 6 games to play around with back then
 MSmits: crap emote
 MSmits: a = b + c? d&#160;: e; a = b + (c? d&#160;: e);
 Mengshang: priority
 MSmits: yes so they are different?
 Mengshang: You can input the text and try to run
 MSmits: lazy
 Mengshang: Can you read what I'm saying?
 MSmits: yeah
 Mengshang: I'm worried that foreigners won't be able to read my "Chinese English"
 Mengshang: :joy:
 MSmits: no no it's fine
 Westicles: I bit Mengshang kisses lots of girls
 MSmits: I am was just wondering if i gave myself a horrible bug
 Mengshang: Ok I copy it
 Westicles: *bet
 MSmits: and it seems like i did, with that ternary assignment
 Mengshang: ...
 Mengshang: I just finished my 16th birthday
 MSmits: grats
 Mengshang: okok,I try to run it in vs
 Westicles: Although joint probability might be too tough for a clash anyhow, not sure
 Mengshang: int a, b = 20, c = 30, d = 40,e=50;
 Mengshang: output:
 Mengshang: 40 60
 Mengshang: 	a = b + c&#160;? d&#160;: e;	std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; std::endl;	a = b + (c&#160;? d&#160;: e);	std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; std::endl;
 MSmits: nice one, thanks =)
 Mengshang: You are welcome
 Mengshang: Have you ever known about China's development?
 MSmits: not sure what you mean
 Mengshang: I mean, in your eyes, how developed China is now
 Westicles: I used to travel to Shenzhen back in the wild early days, great times
 MSmits: I am guessing it depends a lot on what part of the country you look at
 Mengshang: synthesis
 Mengshang: 刷题去
 GroutchKeu: o/
 jbiz: on code clash, frequently me and other players get less than 100%, despite getting 100% in the tests before submission. why?
 anthonyashco: They use different tests with possibly different edge cases for final scoring.
 anthonyashco: It prevents players from hard-coding answers for difficult edge cases.
 jbiz: perhaps but i'm pretty sure at least some of them were fool proof.
 jbiz: this last test literally everyone got 50%.
 anthonyashco: It's certainly possible there are errors, since the tests were written by humans. If you think there's a real error in the test cases I think you can notify people.
 anthonyashco: However, if it's happening frequently, I'd suspect there are surprising edge cases that aren't being handled.
 jbiz: alright, i'll report after checking it if it happens again
 anthonyashco: They don't always give you what the validators are, but you might be able to deduce what's missing by the validator's name.
 anthonyashco: Otherwise, you can click the forum button to discuss your findings.
 miobyte: can anyone help me with k8s?
 MSmits: lol i read that as help me with kids
 derjack: :upside_down:
 MSmits: i am sitting here with a class of 29, so it's kind of applicable :P
 Westicles: summer school?  here only the ones who fail something have to do that
 eulerscheZahl: here summer break only starts in August
 derjack: w00t
 Westicles: well, you guys have to learn eight languages just to get around your own time zone
 MSmits: no it's the last class of the year for these
 MSmits: next week is testweek
 MSmits: and then there are 2 more weeks of almost nothing
 MSmits: class of the schoolyear i mean
 Westicles: Is 220 good enough for gold?  That hint from yesterday really worked
 MSmits: hmm
 MSmits: i dont think so
 MSmits: i guess 100
 MSmits: silver is usually a little less than half of bronze and gold is 10% of silver or so, correct me if i am wrong eulerscheZahl
 MSmits: 20% of silver i mean
 eulerscheZahl: 20% sounds about right
 eulerscheZahl: did you get the brutaltester running yesterday?
 MSmits: nah i got distracted
 MSmits: I keep finding bugs
 MSmits: most of my bot improvements are bugfixes :P
 MSmits: I guess this is what happens when you churn out 1k lines of code in 2 days to get a sim working asap
 Nerchio: damn
 Nerchio: makes me think I have poor man's sim if I have 1k lines in java and I didn't try to keep it low
 MSmits: the difference is probably in the eval
 MSmits: you can have a bad bot with a perfect sim and a poor eval. And your bot is not bad
 Nerchio: yeah it's starting to get difficult to change eval to make it better
 Nerchio: yesterday I did it for 2h to keep up with top20
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: it's stops being fun when you run out of new ideas for eval features
 MSmits: just param fitting is boring
 Nerchio: true I usually give up after a little while of param fitting but I am not in that spot here yet
 MSmits: same
 MSmits: I keep having to refit params after i fix bugs
 TheInitialB: hello
 TheInitialB: :wave:
 MSmits: hi
 TINOUAINANI: good morning
 TINOUAINANI: question: what happens if you use CODING and afterward you use TRAINING, do you still have one card to play or two?
 darkhorse64: You should get two. I think the game summary gives this information
 TINOUAINANI: ok thanks 
 TINOUAINANI: guys is there a way to print to console without a limit, I want to see all my stderr? (c++)
 Leeward: Not within the site, but you can encode it and then decode it elsewhere
 TINOUAINANI: ok thanks
 eulerscheZahl: my bot sucks. even importing the opening from over 200 replays of the duck didn't help&#160;:(
 Nerchio: damn some next level strats eulerscheZahl
 eulerscheZahl: next level fail
 Nerchio: i submitted 3 times in a row and ended #15 every time
 eulerscheZahl: at least the replays were easy to parse, thanks to the excessive game summary
 Nerchio: my bot is consistently bad 
 eulerscheZahl: currently i would be happy about your rank
 Nerchio: problem is i dont exactly know how to fix it
 derjack: write better bot [solved]
 eulerscheZahl: let's try not to give cards to the opponent that often
 Nerchio: i give away cards quite often but usually its connected with a good move
 eulerscheZahl: i do it even for bad moves
 Leeward: I have a question about Code4Life if anybody has played that...
 Leeward: I'm currently in Wood 1. I am able to collect a sample that has a cost of more than 10 molecules total but I cannot carry more than 10 at a time. The way the lab works right now I can only hand in a sample along with the entire cost to get the points. Is there a way to "pay in instalments" or can I simply not process those samples right now?
 eulerscheZahl: there are experience points for completing samples. then you need one molecule of that type less
 Leeward: I don't think I can use expertise yet, it's listed under the "What is in store for me in the higher leagues?" section.
 eulerscheZahl: oh, then you have to wait and not take those samples yes
 eulerscheZahl: yet
 Leeward: I thought so, thanks
 Leeward: About to get promoted to next league though so moot point now lol
 derjack: :tada:
 Westicles: so, about hardcoded opening moves
 Ftyghi: hi
 PrimeDecay: Hi guys!!!
 Westicles: well, it is 300 places better than first move
 Psyho: I'd say hardcoding is still useful
 geppoz:         if (cardTaken.isGoodActionBonus() &amp;&amp; action.getThirdCardType()&#160;!= CardType.BONUS) {
 eulerscheZahl: maybe taking 200 replays from the duck wasn't enough them. or i'm too picky and it's just about opponent close vs not close (without looking at the exact location)
 geppoz: what does it means that in the taskPrioritization class&#160;?
 geppoz: "SemiUselessTaskPrioritization"&#160;? :D
 Nerchio: I don't think its the opening that gets him first place euler
 eulerscheZahl: get a bonus instead of a skill card
 eulerscheZahl: it's surely better than my opening
 eulerscheZahl: but i still have the code in place to steal from someone else
 Psyho: I got a massive boost my disabling releasing in the first two turns :D
 Psyho: *by
 Psyho: my sim likes to hoard debt cards
 eulerscheZahl: will you keep going here on CG? topcoder marathon starts this evening
 eulerscheZahl: and you are in a good position for TCO
 Psyho: but the big problem with such strategy (apart for huge variance, so that 200 games is not enough to stabilize the ranking) is that you give your opponent easy time of selecting the apps that block your progress
 Psyho: I'm switching to marathon today, I only have 100 points (just did a single marathon) and I probably need to win again in order to qualify for the TCO
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd or 3rd might be enough. but 1st will surely help
 eulerscheZahl: in any case: good luck with TCO
 eulerscheZahl: it's "The Encore" in Boston this year
 Psyho: I have to be above tanzaku &amp; Jaco + few other people can snipe my spot
 Nerchio: what kind of tasks they have in there
 Psyho: optimization
 Psyho: it's mostly weird heuristics, local search (simulated annealing), some pathfinding (beam search mostly)
 Darleanow: Can we move backwards&#160;?
 Darleanow: and can we cross player eg p1 is on 2 and p2 is on 3, can i move 4&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: the last 3 tasks:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/9bb1c5e1-dbb3-4407-be0e-3cc0dc45bf1a">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/9bb1c5e1-dbb3-4407-be0e-3cc0dc45bf1a</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/ef5d19d2-de9b-4e37-b428-e7e103458425">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/ef5d19d2-de9b-4e37-b428-e7e103458425</a><a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/5ac77343-7f2f-4635-8aff-bbf49c700fda">https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/5ac77343-7f2f-4635-8aff-bbf49c700fda</a>
 eulerscheZahl: you can even go to the same desk as your opponent, Darleanow
 eulerscheZahl: but also walk by
 Darleanow: okay&#160;!
 Darleanow: but we an't move backwards right&#160;!
 Darleanow: Also, after submit application, can i change the way i move, eg going backwards&#160;? and can i do it initially&#160;?
 Darleanow: sorry for the spam - -'
 eulerscheZahl: you can go anywhere except yto your current location
 struct: hi
 eulerscheZahl: huhu
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: cant go backwards, sorry scroll
 jacek: :upside_down:
 aangairbender: bug with not going to PLAY_CARD phase after TRAINING still exists? I've just met it
 Nerchio: it was fixed 
 kovi: phase is still missing if there is no useable card
 aangairbender: I guess referee just automatically sees that no action can be played so he skips
 aangairbender: okay, thank you
 kovi: yes
 Nerchio: yep
 aangairbender: viewer was just showing this in a weird way (I didnt see card I got after training)
 PiterYeh: aangairbender if your turn is over, all your cards are discarder and what you see in the viewer is the hand you will have in your next turn
 PiterYeh: you can see which cards "training" got you by reading the referee output
 aangairbender: okay, thanks for help
 struct: Was forgetting to remove training card from my hand when playing it
 struct: might explain the million of states I was getting
 struct: :p
 jzen: Is the bonus card considered a skill card?
 aangairbender: jzen yes
 jzen: Thanks
 struct: in what aspect?
 struct: For me a skill card is a card you can use during play phase
 BrunoFelthes: can i use the task prioritisation card acquired at the same turn?
 struct: yes
 jzen: Yeah, I thought so too, but then I was looking at throw. It says you can throw a skill card from your hand, but looking at source that includes the bonus card
 geppoz: bonus cards can be used for THROW, for GIVE, and in TASK_PRIO
 geppoz: and in CONT_INT
 struct: yes you can throw bonus
 struct: you only cant throw/give technical debt cards
 MSmits: struct, also remove the coding card from your hand when coding
 elliotdingalberriesmells: this is a dead game icl
 elliotdingalberriesmells: all of yous are sad 
 <b>**Rodrigo_the_coder slaps /slap around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/17784428403916" /> MSmits: I don't feel sad?
 Astrobytes: it's like when they come in and call us sad nerds. We're happy nerds!
 putibuzu: Agreed :D 
 eulerscheZahl: nerds in cage housing. that's how we like it
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: I finally saw the video euler
 struct: I knew it was bad, but no idea that the industry was that bad
 Astrobytes: you don't remember re curse regaling us with tales from the industry?
 eulerscheZahl: he manages to entertain us and make us sad at the same time
 struct: not really astro
 eulerscheZahl: recurse even linked an article basically telling the same as we saw in the video
 struct: Maybe I wasn't online
 eulerscheZahl: and there's the ping
 struct: not online
 Astrobytes: he used to talk about it a lot tbh, ubisoft being one of the better places to work it seems
 putibuzu: what video if I may ask?

 putibuzu: thanks&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: beat me, i had to search it again
 eulerscheZahl: oh, btw:
 eulerscheZahl: Hi,
 eulerscheZahl: website will go down again
 Astrobytes: it's a popular site nowadays
 eulerscheZahl: "Get more free dyno hours per month Simply verify your account with a credit card and receive an additional 450 free dyno hours per month."sounds simple. but i don't have a credit card
 eulerscheZahl: and most visits are from search engines
 Astrobytes: really?
 Astrobytes: (re search engines)
 eulerscheZahl: what even is a SemrushBot?
 eulerscheZahl: bingbot, pedalbot, googlebot, ...
 eulerscheZahl: so many of them
 Astrobytes: SemrushBot is the search bot software that Semrush sends out to discover and collect new and updated web data.
 Astrobytes: Data collected by SemrushBot is used for: the public backlink search engine index maintained as a dedicated tool called Backlink Analytics (webgraph of links)
 Astrobytes: TIL. I thought it was a bot that was kind of in a hurry but not overly so.
 eulerscheZahl: i guess i go up a bit in website ranking. then i run out of dynos and drop again because i'm offline
 eulerscheZahl: can't be good for your page rank to have an error page
 Astrobytes: indeed
 Haikooo: someone can explain me what is readline(), In internet I just find docs for Node.js but i'm using for JS
 eulerscheZahl: there is no readline actually, codingame wrote their own to support JS on the website
 eulerscheZahl: gives you a line from stdin
 Haikooo: ok so readline() it's similar like what&#160;? 
 Haikooo: what is the goal of this function
 struct: it reads an input line
 Astrobytes: to read a line from stdin as he said.
 eulerscheZahl: are you familiar with console applications? that black window with text only
 Haikooo: okay thx
 Miki09: can task priorization be used on itself?
 Astrobytes: if you have more than one I think so
 Miki09: ok thx
 3ssila_mli7a: What is the name of the algorithme that we have to use in the practice: Death First Search - Episode 1
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Try replacing a letter in 'Death'
 3ssila_mli7a: Depth First Search&#160;? is this an algorithm, sorry I am new to this
 Astrobytes: or actually is it? I think it's Breadth First Search actually, my bad
 Astrobytes: I think the second one involves Depth First
 3ssila_mli7a: Breadth First Search it is 
 3ssila_mli7a: I'll try n search for it 
 Astrobytes: if it's new to you, I strongly suggest this site:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.redblobgames.com/">https://www.redblobgames.com/</a>
 3ssila_mli7a: To see what it s like
 Astrobytes: Very clear explanations
 3ssila_mli7a: Oh, thank you very much I'll take a look at it 
 Astrobytes: no problem, hope it helps
 Astrobytes: how many was that to gold league? 100?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, gold
 struct: a bit more
 struct: I was promoted and was around 110
 struct: 109
 struct: I was
 Dapps: whoops.. .shouldn't have just submitted
 Astrobytes: ah ok
 Miki09: Dapps me too&#160;:-)
 BrunoFelthes: 74 now
 eulerscheZahl: for gold opening it's fine. the league isn't big enough to crash the server
 struct: ah no
 struct: I wasnt promoted
 struct: I just got the message the league opened
 eulerscheZahl: 100% tie rate so far<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/m28c0iv.png">https://i.imgur.com/m28c0iv.png</a>
 Astrobytes: ah
 eulerscheZahl: and 2 more
 Dapps: any way to tell which AI became boss? or just if they have any output
 Astrobytes: must have been 80-90 then
 eulerscheZahl: the only way is to play boss vs itself and do the same with some players in that range
 Michael_Howard: Only 74 of us by the looks of it.
 Miki09: the servers are slowwwwwwww
 struct: legend will be pretty hard
 Astrobytes: a few more still to promote Michael_Howard
 Astrobytes: ~12 currently
 eulerscheZahl: 19 matches (38 in total) and all draws. that's unlikely to happen
 struct: well its the same problem that uttt has
 Astrobytes: wow
 struct: 1st player will always almost win
 Astrobytes: yeah it's quite skewed
 eulerscheZahl: but seriously: 22 mirrored matches now. all ties
 eulerscheZahl: and it just keeps going
 wlesavo: eulerscheZahl  look inside
 eulerscheZahl: crashes :D
 wlesavo: first player timeouts everytime
 mikmak: yes the input are probably incorrect
 Astrobytes: lol whaaay
 Astrobytes: or whaaat
 kovi: match# cut down for rerun i guess
 eulerscheZahl: so player 2 wins
 Miki09: zach_lee probably found a way to fix it
 Miki09: and he wins all the time
 wlesavo: and why i have fr rules now? :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74936757-7508-4057-bfec-78ae210c549a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/74936757-7508-4057-bfec-78ae210c549a</a>

 therealbeef: something is weird, my bots prediction of the next game phase is wrong all the time
 Astrobytes: I thiiink someone should report this
 eulerscheZahl: cardLocationsCount is gone?
 therealbeef: in silver it always matched the referee
 eulerscheZahl: i expect a number and get:HAND 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1
 wlesavo: what a way to fix p1 advantage :grinning:
 Astrobytes: :D
 eulerscheZahl: [SG]Sebastien did you touch the referee?
 BrunoFelthes: the winner of this contest will be defined by luck.. who win two mach first, will win more points...
 Astrobytes: perhaps it's reverted to another version
 Michael_Howard: Is it normal to go way up in rank after promotion?
 Michael_Howard: I've gone from 70s to 30s.
 eulerscheZahl: they should do that for the final rerun to see how bulletproof our codes are
 eulerscheZahl: i'm 12th \o/
 eulerscheZahl: 11th
 wlesavo: Michael_Howard yes game is broken
 wlesavo: im 8 :smiley:
 eulerscheZahl: and top3 adapted to the new format already
 eulerscheZahl: top4 probably
 BrunoFelthes: what new format?
 Michael_Howard: wlesavo but why is it broken in my favour in Gold? :upside_down:
 eulerscheZahl: changed input format. probably by mistake
 Astrobytes: someone in gold report it on discord please
 BrunoFelthes: what changed in input?
 Nerchio: wait what happened
 eulerscheZahl: they don't give cardLocationCount anymore
 therealbeef: tooltip all weird too
 Nerchio: why is my description in french :D
 eulerscheZahl: best guess: older version of the game
 eulerscheZahl: probably all the bugs are back as well
 eulerscheZahl: right, french as well
 eulerscheZahl: someone ping staff
 Nerchio: @staff hello
 Miki09: First time ever in my life I beated Neumann <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/644522279">https://www.codingame.com/replay/644522279</a>
 Michael_Howard: I'm ahead of kovi! Stop the count!
 [SG]Sebastien: eulerscheZahl&#160;: no modification on referee since monday's fixes
 Astrobytes: reported in Bug Report EVEN THOUGH IM NOT IN GOLD
 eulerscheZahl: then something went wrong with automated league opening
 wlesavo: hehe time to get top1
 eulerscheZahl: with thibaud ping?
 Astrobytes: he's offline
 Nerchio: i want a refund
 Michael_Howard: Ahead of eulerscheZahl!! :laughing:
 eulerscheZahl: [CG]Thibaud is online here
 Michael_Howard: Whatever the bug is I like it
 eulerscheZahl: ping. game reverted to a prior version on gold opening (supposedly)
 Astrobytes: that's my theory
 jod_uran: h
 Astrobytes: can't think of anything else
 wlesavo: best ranking improove in history by changing a single constant 
 eulerscheZahl: always 6 instead of dynamic?
 wlesavo: yes =)
 eulerscheZahl: i'll just want for CG
 kovi: french description?
 eulerscheZahl: that's the only thing you notice?
 kovi: gold
 eulerscheZahl: is silver still working as expected?
 Miki09: yes
 eulerscheZahl: all bots crashing because of changed input format
 eulerscheZahl: astro reported it already
 Astrobytes: I don't know if anyone's working on it yet, no indication, but I presume they know by now
 eulerscheZahl: always RANDOM can bring you in top10 again
 [SG]Sebastien: I tried to ping Thibaud, but no answer yet
 eulerscheZahl: no biggie, they will find out
 Astrobytes: should I ping Julien?
 eulerscheZahl: him or Saiksy
 eulerscheZahl: thibaud would do the same
 Astrobytes: I've pinged Julien
 wlesavo: still haven't lost a single game out of 70, i guess top is not adopted euler
 eulerscheZahl: take your screenshot
 Nerchio: euler we are at the bottom of the league, maybe we shouldnt be playing games with random draw
 ilgiocatore: almost there
 ilgiocatore: i want to see the match where both players see 6 cards
 Dili: hi
 Dili: dfa
 Dili: adf
 Dili: dsf
 struct: stop
 Illedan: oooh, gold
 square1001: I learned that AI says "IA" in French now
 Nerchio: your bot is crashing Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: you missed the funny part Illedan
 Astrobytes: oui, c'est l'intelligence artificielle square1001
 Illedan: wtf?
 Illedan: What is funny?
 eulerscheZahl: the crashing
 eulerscheZahl: input changed. french statement
 Illedan: I see it now
 Illedan: LOL
 Illedan: Did you ping staff on discord?
 Astrobytes: Yeah
 eulerscheZahl: astro pinged julien
 Illedan: Did it work?
 Astrobytes: No response as of yet
 eulerscheZahl: do you see any improvements?
 eulerscheZahl: just submit a RANDOM bot
 [SG]Sebastien: based on a replay I saw, µI confirm this is an old version of the game
 Illedan: Meh
 Illedan: And I had 10 min to try something
 Astrobytes: I used Bug Report Illedan
 eulerscheZahl: what is bug report?
 Astrobytes: [SG]Sebastien theory confirmed :tada:
 Astrobytes: the channel on the discord euler
 eulerscheZahl: you are the sharpest tool in the box
 eulerscheZahl: ah, that # :bug: bug-report
 Astrobytes: lol, yes
 ilgiocatore: yaay i managed to climb before a bugfix, took my screenshot and now i can rest
 eulerscheZahl: this doesn't count
 wlesavo: in old version daily worked only in one direction, inrteresting
 wlesavo: i think that is kind of more balanced
 Astrobytes: alright, Julien has seen the message "oh dear"
 Miki09: can task priorization throw itself away?
 Astrobytes: only if you have more than one, that's what I meant earlier Miki09
 Astrobytes: (that's what I thought you were asking)
 Miki09: thank you. I didnt know if I formulated the question correctly
 eulerscheZahl: interesting experiment: how fast will the leaderboard stabilize again without a full resubmit? just slowly bubbling up
 Astrobytes: no worries&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: I'm almost certain they'll do a full resubmit euler
 Michael_Howard: eulerscheZahl in O(n2)
 Michael_Howard: O(n²)
 eulerscheZahl: n² take a square
 eulerscheZahl: ¹³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹⁰
 eulerscheZahl: weird, drops after 4th power
 Astrobytes: exponential decay
 BrunoFelthes: my statements changed to fr, how to back it to english?:
 Astrobytes: there are bigger issues than that BRuno, it's reverted to an earlier version of the game
 [SG]Sebastien: the statements are in the gazme package. All should be fixed at the same time
 BrunoFelthes: so, the input will not be changed?
 [SG]Sebastien: it will revert back to what you had before
 BrunoFelthes: oh, ty
 Wontonimo: lol, exponential decay
 Astrobytes: eulerscheZahl: is it working now?
 Astrobytes: It's been updated
 Astrobytes: Wontonimo :D
 Astrobytes: Anyone in gold league confirm it's working?
 wlesavo: it is
 wlesavo: now im timing out
 wlesavo: :smiley:
 Nerchio: punishment for all the impatient people :D
 Nerchio: so do we have to resubmit ourselves
 Astrobytes: I guess
 Nerchio: there's no games as p1 p2 though
 eulerscheZahl: i'll wait for the bubble :popcorn:
 wlesavo: Nerchio maybe it is still an older version but a different one :smiley:
 wlesavo: we should check if the training bug is still there
 eulerscheZahl: it's an English one
 [SG]Sebastien: games p1/p2 then p2/p1 is a set up on codingame's side, not in the game source code
 Astrobytes: wait, there's no mirrored games as before?
 eulerscheZahl: mirror matches are gone
 Astrobytes: ok let me report that
 _thienthanh_: hallo leute
 Nerchio: we should let it stay this way so I have better chances of being in the top
 Nerchio: by just being lucky
 eulerscheZahl: but i can confirm: the game creator has no affect on mirror matches
 Psyho: does rating distribution (like rating inflation) impact match making system on CG or does only care about relative placements?
 eulerscheZahl: opponent = your rank-10 to +10 or so
 eulerscheZahl: not sure if equal probability
 Astrobytes: Julien is on the mirror match issue (broken in other leagues too btw)
 eulerscheZahl: you pinged the right guy
 Astrobytes: ok should be fixed
 wlesavo: euler i think probability is based on the score difference
 wlesavo: fixed in gold confirmed
 Astrobytes: same in silver (Should be the same across all leagues)
 jacek: first gold in contests :tada:
 Nerchio: hidden NN incoming?
 Astrobytes: grats jacek!
 Psyho: it will take ages for this ranking to make sense
 MSmits: are you saying you should not be nr 1 Psyho?
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 Psyho: probably, although at this point I have no clue
 Psyho: it's a new version as well
 MSmits: oh i see
 Nerchio: well i was top15 not top2 so yeah xd
 Nerchio: Psyho number1 is more probable
 struct: We all know who is getting rank 1
 MSmits: It must be someone who puts training cards in played pile
 struct: definitely 
 MSmits: nice bug btw, i also found some
 MSmits: small ones
 MSmits: I forgot to reduce from a desk when i picked up a card
 MSmits: hand[i]++ but not board[i]--
 MSmits: doesnt matter a whole lot, but it matters a little later on for eval
 MSmits: oh and i calculated distance wrong for daily thingy
 MSmits: so i could not pick up from some desks
 struct: I think we can agree that you only found it because I reported my bug
 struct: :p
 MSmits: hehe i dunno. I am bugchecking all day and i keep finding new ones&#160;:)
 struct: I should do that
 MSmits: it's more efficient than fitting parameters for me
 MSmits: I really rushed creating the sim
 struct: I'm going to redo mine
 jacek: how shoddy of you
 MSmits: I googled shoddy lyric
 MSmits: got this
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed77f100-31f5-4550-aaa0-84958a9e6d8d">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ed77f100-31f5-4550-aaa0-84958a9e6d8d</a>
 MSmits: oh nvm, no workie
 jacek: and probably wont until the end of chat
 MSmits: sigh. Seems like my bugfixed bot gets 57% WR vs old bot, but I can't submit now&#160;:(
 jacek: hm?
 struct: cooldown?
 MSmits: the leaderboard is meaningless
 MSmits: because of gold opening
 struct: why?
 struct: too much rng?
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: ah
 MSmits: have to wait till everyone who is offline is done submitting
 MSmits: calms the leaderboard down
 jacek: thats so green
 jacek: maybe thats the way to win it
 jacek: and leaderboard is a decoy
 MSmits: who knows
 miobyte: anyone here can help me with k8s?
 Astrobytes: you asked that yesterday or the day before
 jacek: is that a puzzle
 kovi: it is harder to ascend when top is actually in middle of leaderboard
 Nerchio: I am the top now hehe
 Psyho: it gets easier when you get to the top&#160;;)
 Nerchio: it will take some time before people bring me down maybe I should leave it until friday 
 Nerchio: :sunglasses:
 emh: Gold opened early?
 struct: yes
 struct: and I thought I passed because of the notification
 struct: now I have to start coding again
 emh: good luck
 emh: me too if I am going to be sure to reach Legend
 emh: when it opens
 struct: Not sure I can make it to legend this time, fewer players and the top is too strong
 Julian_Dixon: you ive read through and completed all excercises in an intro to python book and im still finding "the descent" impossible, is there somewhere i can get coding experience without already knowing how to code? like every time i try to get into it i get into this feedback loop of "well you just need to get better by doing it" but "I cant DO it"
 struct: press hints on the left Julian_Dixon
 struct: maybe you are just struggling to understand how inputs and outputs work
 emh: Julian_Dixon study "algorithms" to get smarter after knowing how to code
 jacek: programming aside, you need to familiarize yourself with inputs/outputs here. more advanced people struggle at first
 Julian_Dixon: Im almost done with a math minor and a engineerig physics degree, I dont think my uderstanding of algorithms is the problem
 struct: So which part do you think you are struggling with?
 struct: the descent is turn based
 struct: you get inputs from stdin each turn
 Sarzorus: Yeah the level of study you get in algorithms at school isn't easily replaced with just doing it. Maybe in some cases you can, but  in general it's very difficult without some background in implicit proofs, and/or knowing the general algorithm classes/types. 
 struct: and you must output to stdout
 Julian_Dixon: somehow this is the first ive heard of stin and stdout. Ive already completed a whole computational physics course, how is that possible
 Julian_Dixon: im pulling my hair out lol
 Uljahn: maybe try to understand the solution in the hints on the left?
 Julian_Dixon: Ill do that i guess thanks
 Crosility: Howdy Everyone&#160;:]
 Julian_Dixon: I think my problem is that coding requires a LOT of creativity and I have zero
 wlesavo: well not for this puzzle
 Crosility: Creativity? More like deductive reasoning, and problem solving.&#160;:]
 Sheeesh---: everything will come with practice
 Julian_Dixon: well i say that because theres 12 ways to write a program that does the same thing yknow?
 Crosility: Do first, optimize later (once you've obtained practice and skills)
 struct: you dont need to overthink that puzzle
 Julian_Dixon: and @Sheeesh--- that where i get confused, because to practice coding, you have to know how to code something more than like a prime number checker
 Crosility: Julian, I think you'd benefit from watching a CS50 course on youtube.
 Julian_Dixon: That sounds like a good idea
 wlesavo: if you have basic understanding of conditions and loops you can practice on cg
 Julian_Dixon: I do
 Sarzorus: Lol in our class on state machines we went through a proof that any program has an uncountable infinite ways to write it. However most statements can be boiled down to a minimum working version which isn't creativity just reasoning. 
 jacek: there are so many ways to do sorting
 jacek: you can even dance <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3San3uKKHgg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3San3uKKHgg</a>
 Sheeesh---: LOL
 Sheeesh---: made my day
 Julian_Dixon: what. did i just watch
 Julian_Dixon: I mean intuitively i get it but that doesnt help me understand how to translate it to computer language
 ilgiocatore: quick sort is a pretty advanced algorithm, i guess
 Astrobytes: for simple problems, writing it out on paper/whiteboard and solving a few cases by hand is useful, you can then translate that to code
 Crosility: Quick sort has a fatal flaw.
 Westicles: programming isn't for everyone. somebody has to make the pizzas
 Julian_Dixon: is it that you need to know how to dance?? haha
 Crosility: It sucks at sorting already sorted lists/mostly sorted lists.
 Crosility: But yes, need to learn to dance. :P
 Sheeesh---: i guess most of the time the list is not sorted
 jacek: most sorting used are mix of sort algorithm with analyzing of partially sorted sublists
 jacek: like <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort</a>
 Sheeesh---: oh i see
 JohnyDaison: jacek what the hell is that video? :D who are those people? how did they stay serious throughout that?? :D
 jacek: these are CG servers behind the scenes
 AlitorTheWise: Hello, can I talk with the people in a clash od code?  I mean, I supose to, but how can I find the room to do it? Tx
 JohnyDaison: Do you see other tabs than World above this chat?
 jacek: it should add automatically once clash starts
 jacek: or before that (?)
 Noyotens: any advices?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/644632231">https://www.codingame.com/replay/644632231</a>
 struct: you got 4 tech on first release
 struct: doesnt seem like a great idea
 Illedan: :scream:
 struct: also on 2nd and 3rd release
 struct: seems like you like to collect tech 
 struct: :p
 jacek: tech?
 JohnyDaison: tech debt
 jacek: oh
 eulerscheZahl: did nerchio improve so much or is the leaderboard still out of place?
 eulerscheZahl: in any case: don't touch it until legend opens
 jacek: now im gonna touch it
 Psyho: it's out of place by a lot
 Psyho: everyone that submitted right after fix is very high, everyone that didn't (like duck) is very low
 struct: What is the draw rate between top bots?
 struct: in 2 matches I mean
 Psyho: dunno, but I'd imagine draws are very rare (2% at most?), it's improbable to tie on debt
 Psyho: oh
 Psyho: that's not what you asked about
 struct: yeah its a bit diferent sory
 struct: sorry*
 Psyho: it's hard to tell, because the top bots are in the middle of the leaderboard
 struct: ah ok
 jacek: the 2 matches have the same seed/
 Psyho: but surprisingly p1 doesn't have enormous advantage
 Psyho: MOVE 5 and MOVE 2 first are both decent options
 Psyho: knowing what your enemy is going for also gives you p2 a small edge
 lifetimeLearner007: TRAINING (0). The team draws 2 cards How do I know which 2 cards I'm going to draw?
 struct: you don't
 struct: unless there are only 2 cards to draw
 struct: first it draws cards from the draw pile, if its empty then it will draw from the discard pile
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl wow rude :joy:
 lifetimeLearner007: if it is not known which cards will be drawn, how do we look ahead to find best action?
 struct: You take into account probability 
 jacek: :scream:
 struct: I managed to do it, so I don't think it's very hard
 ilgiocatore: most players just don't use training and coding :relaxed:
 lifetimeLearner007: it seems like it is better to not use training and coding rather than spend time on handling probability(which is not 100% accurate)
 ilgiocatore: although i use coding, but only for extra move
 ilgiocatore: if i have multiple useful cards in hand
 lifetimeLearner007: also, how do we know when the phase is going to change and to what phase? If I were to simulate, how do I know?
 struct: well if you move and go over admin table then the next phase is thor
 struct: throw*
 struct: if you land near opponent then its give
 struct: and so on
 struct: you need to take that into account when you create the sim
 lifetimeLearner007: hmmm. This game has more unknowns than the previous games, or I haven't understood the game completely
 struct: you can predict the next phase
 struct: until it reaches opponent turn
 ilgiocatore: phases are within one turn: move -&gt; [throw] -&gt; [give] -&gt; play -&gt; release
 lifetimeLearner007: yes but the movement from discard pile to draw pile to in hand  is not deterministic right?
 darkhorse64: it is. All discard goes to draw when draw is empty. Draw to hand is random
 lifetimeLearner007: what matters most is random,. haha
 Nerchio: life is random so get used to it
 Illedan: Educated random
 emh: took a sleeping pill yesterday to come down from my programming high, but it lasts too long so I slept all day. now I want energy drink but it's too late in the evening
 MSmits: I've never taken a sleeping pill
 emh: well it's also against schizo
 emh: but it makes me sleep
 MSmits: for a second I thought you meant to suggest I should take it for schizo
 emh: haha
 MSmits: :P
 MSmits: I try to hardcode openings but it makes my bot worse
 emh: I've a list of prioritized openings
 Illedan: This skewed placement is a pain to test against
 emh: mostly 2 and 5
 MSmits: yeah i try to hardcode 2 as p2
 struct: MSmits still enough time for meta mcts
 MSmits: but it made my bot 40% WR vs old bot
 struct: :D
 MSmits: heh yeah, i actually did consider that&#160;:)
 Illedan: Just do mcts :P
 MSmits: still am
 jacek: that would be so green
 struct: 4 is the worst opening for p1 right?
 Illedan: nah
 struct: You are forced to either give or go to admin next move
 jacek: 3 3 is best opening
 emh: once you have enough heuristics in place the game gets too complicated to add more, for example taking into account probabilities of draw pile. the combinations of things to think about grow and there are so many considerations worth little each
 MSmits: yeah
 emh: struct hmm that reminds me, I have a priority to go from 2 to 4, as I can still get CI and block opponent from it, but I didn't think about having to go to admin after if opponent moves 2 steps ahead
 MSmits: this is why i do a sim, but when my bot starts the game, it behaves weirdly. 
 Illedan: How do you search it?
 MSmits: brute force, i just do a dfs with eval
 MSmits: for my turn
 struct: and probability
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: when he draws using training/coding
 MSmits: it's kinda hard to deal with architecture and daily on a search like that
 MSmits: because they dont provide benefit within the turn
 MSmits: I just give them a score, but nothing i do makes my bot use daily. I am not sure if i have a bug there
 BrunoFelthes: I just add score to daily at first turns... After it, i only use, if i have nothing more to do...
 MSmits: yeah i think that is what my bot does too
 MSmits: well except for the first turn
 MSmits: i cant make it go to 2 unless i force my bot
 MSmits: my p2 bot goes straight to refactor 
 MSmits: which seems completely nuts as the admin desk is next
 MSmits: but on the other hand, p1 is force to move to coding 
 Illedan: Too high scoring on losing debt
 Illedan: I had that too
 MSmits: on having debt you mean
 Illedan: ye
 MSmits: but yes, i guess so
 MSmits: i wonder if it is bad though
 MSmits: you force p1 to make a big jump as well
 emh: I don't worry much about debt
 emh: top players generally end with lots of debt. at least in Silver it was like that
 emh: or a while ago
 jacek: becuase they were using 1st action
 emh: my priority is releasing early and often. but not too early, as I want to get my CI going
 Nerchio: damn i had a bug where I miscalculated penalty for card giveaway
 Nerchio: basically the penalty was on every move no matter what lol
 MSmits: ouch
 Illedan: Hard to understand progress here
 MSmits: yeah i tis
 Illedan: 1 random move different and I win / lose
 Nerchio: there's a lot of randomness in the draw, people literally drawing all "good" cards when their draw deck is full of debt
 MSmits: well thats a 1 turn benefit
 Nerchio: so just search for your bad moves and don't look at the result I guess
 MSmits: next turn you will get all your TD&#160;:)
 Nerchio: the games end very fast MSmits
 struct: Does the game always starts with 12 apps?
 Nerchio: so 1 lucky turn is often all you need
 MSmits: true, this is a problem on the last turn mostly
 miobyte: can anyone help me with k8s?
 BrunoFelthes: Nerchio, do you try to block the opponent move?
 Nerchio: not yet but I have it written down
 Nerchio: and it would mostly be against people who go for 30 tech debt wins lol
 BrunoFelthes: i tried, but it got worst
 Nerchio: yeah it's probably tricky to get it right
 MSmits: BrunoFelthes got worse for me as well
 emh: BrunoFelthes I block opponent, but only if he has only one choice left for his only automated skill card. doesn't make sense to block if he's got options
 Illedan: 1 option left?
 emh: one application which needs the skill
 emh: of course he have other options, but not with that skill
 Nerchio: one application to rule them all
 emh: and in the CI bind them
 TINOUAINANI: Hi, is there a trick to print all errors with out limit in the console&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: online it will always be truncated
 Dapps: Damn.. guess I've gone as far as my if/else skills will take me. Can't get higher than top 20 silver
 struct: My vs is so broken
 jacek: if second player releases 5th app, its over no matter what?
 struct: ys
 struct: yes*
 Kellthazar: my bot was running only with my "MOVE" phase logic... duh!
 JohnyDaison: struct, but there should be one more turn for the first to release, right?
 IvesL: what makes the game so little participants?
 jacek: it was announce a week before
 Nerchio: I didn't sign up on 3000 acounts this time
 struct: No JohnyDaison because both players played the same amount of turns
 JohnyDaison: that's a bit counter-intuitive, but ok
 struct: not really, it would probably help p1 if it was the case
 struct: He could just keep lowering his technical debt
 TINOUAINANI: is it possible to simulate all possible outcomes including TRAINING and CODING in less than 50 ms?
 struct: No
 BrunoFelthes: for 1 turn, yes, if you hash things
 Illedan: And if you throw all cards first
 struct: even if you have 5 training and 5 coding?
 struct: He did say all possible
 BrunoFelthes: yes, because, the result, will be the same
 BrunoFelthes: just hash things, i said yes, i didnt say that is easy
 BrunoFelthes: because order do not make difference
 struct: Maybe I'm thinking of something different
 MSmits: BrunoFelthes with probability it may make a difference
 MSmits: the order
 BrunoFelthes: some orders yes, but others no
 MSmits: true, i just enforce orders when it doesn't matter
 MSmits: so i dont use hashing atm
 MSmits: but i also limit to 3x training/coding per turn
 BrunoFelthes: but i think that is it possible, it is just hard to do
 MSmits: so i might use hashing soon
 struct: Yes draws have to be limited
 struct: I dont think its feasible in 50ms to calculate all states possible
 MSmits: well it is possible for most situations
 MSmits: it's just not possible for a rare few
 BrunoFelthes: What i do, is to random the draft and test possible things
 MSmits: random the draft after the turn?
 BrunoFelthes: we are talking about the same turn
 MSmits: oh ok
 BrunoFelthes: train/code
 MSmits: I don't random, i loop over all possible train/code result and weigh the eval by the probability of the draw
 BrunoFelthes: and can you run at all of the states?
 MSmits: yeah if i limit to 3 plays in 1 turn. Could do 4 in most cases, probably 4 or 5 if i do some more optimization
 MSmits: i might switch to iterative deepening for this. 
 Illedan: The randomness of these games :scream;
 BrunoFelthes: oh... i do a diferent aproach... 
 struct: thats what I meant on all possible :p
 MSmits: I'll explain how to do it on monday
 MSmits: i mean i kinda did now
 MSmits: but i'll share code
 Psyho: so you only evaluate after a single move?
 MSmits: after a full turn, but yes, there is 1 move in there
 MSmits: i dont know how to go on after this
 BrunoFelthes: do you evaluate the entire game psyho?
 Psyho: yep
 BrunoFelthes: god
 MSmits: that's amazing
 JohnyDaison: Psyho, but you are making assumptions based on Math.Random(), right?
 MSmits: you can't brute force that, that has to have loads of random
 BrunoFelthes: with train/cod?
 ilgiocatore: the next step is to evaluate 5 games ahead
 Psyho: funnily enough, I believe I explained my approach at the end of the stream
 Psyho: and did exactly that
 MSmits: there is a strea,?
 MSmits: m?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.twitch.tv/FakePsyho">https://www.twitch.tv/FakePsyho</a>
 BrunoFelthes: I'm analising Psyho games, he do not have a lot draw pile
 Psyho: I did stream my first day of the contest
 MSmits: oh ok
 BrunoFelthes: maybe it is the secret
 Psyho: it's just monte carlo with full games with heuristic strategy for both players
 Illedan: I do the full game too, but I set a cutoff to not go too far into nothing
 Psyho: and eval is based on win%
 MSmits: I see
 BrunoFelthes: nice
 eulerscheZahl: and that works? i'm impressed
 Psyho: I thought it's impossible to write good midstate eval for this game
 MSmits: so ordinary monte carlo? No mcts?
 MSmits: i should say, ucb guided mc
 MSmits: not mcts
 BrunoFelthes: what is the difference between mcts and monte carlo?
 struct: monte carlo doesnt remember
 jacek: ts
 struct: mcts stores info
 Psyho: funnily enough, I never did implement MCTS, but I don't see how it can be done here
 BrunoFelthes: i see
 MSmits: well mcts is the wrong choice as it is adversarial, but for your turn you have several phases in a row, you could use UCB to guide your decisions within your turn
 struct: its a bit more detailed than that
 jacek: you can do UCB at first level
 Psyho: after your turn is done or you play coding/training the branching factor is too big
 Psyho: and you need a lot of games for prediction
 Smekarn: Impressive lead @Psyco, nice!
 eulerscheZahl: any highly speed-optimized simulation at least?
 eulerscheZahl: let's wait for the duck to resubmit
 Psyho: nothing fancy
 struct: If you want I can share with you my MCTS code for one of my bots BrunoFelthes, after the contest ends
 Psyho: if you expand the full tree until the end of the turn/coding/training you can just eval all of the nodes
 Psyho: so no need for MCTS
 Psyho: i.e. you get enough sims
 MSmits: yeah, BrunoFelthes just dont imagine using mcts very often on these contests, its useful for simple board games mostly
 MSmits: Psyho if you eval the nodes, you dont have the future info like you do on a full game MC
 Psyho: Smekarn, oh yeah I doubt I should be first now, the ranking is broken
 Psyho: yeah, I just think it's impossible here to make a good solution based on eval
 MSmits: i almost agree with that
 MSmits: it's possible to make a good solution based on eval
 struct: So I should be doing better, since i dont know how to write evals
 MSmits: just not a great solution
 Psyho: ideal solution is RL where you update the model via rollouts
 jacek: :thinking:
 Psyho: (rollout = MC in RL terms)
 Psyho: (I'm dumping the whole knowledge know becaus it's essentially the last day of competition for me, except for running local league system on a VM that tries to find better params for the MC (heuristic strategy in sims)
 MSmits: Psyho i appreciate you sharing a lot, but for your own benefit it is better to share on monday 
 eulerscheZahl: and then you will be placing stones with increasing numbers on a grid instead
 MSmits: even if it is your last day coding
 MSmits: I share a lot but usually not my whole search. Only reason I shared my brute force here is because euler already did
 eulerscheZahl: i did?
 MSmits: yeah before me
 MSmits: i figured, well cat is out of the bag anyway
 eulerscheZahl: but it's so plain stupid, no one will gain anything with it
 struct: I will
 MSmits: yeah maybe, sometimes proof of concept is all people need to imitate
 struct: just wiat
 struct: wait*
 Psyho: tbf, if euler didn't share his brutaltester jar I wouldn't be even close to that
 Psyho: *to the top
 MSmits: oh yeah, he does that&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: oh wow, you trusted a relative stranger to execute that code
 eulerscheZahl: i feel honored
 Kellthazar: hahahaha
 Psyho: it's java, what harm could it do 
 Illedan: xD
 Noyotens: boss 4 has not provided an action in time. 
 Noyotens: why?
 jacek: w00t
 struct: Maybe it breaks at this exact time
 MSmits: Noyotens too slow
 Psyho: the thing that I find the most shocking is that juju is 2nd with python
 jacek: dont they see the source code?
 MSmits: mmh my code would run in python also and not timeout i think
 kovi: either already NN or very nice set of heuristics
 MSmits: but i am not 2nd&#160;:)
 Noyotens: MSmits, the bot is slow
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: apparently&#160;:)
 MSmits: or just a bug in the bot
 Noyotens: i changed the seed &amp; my code but its still broken
 Noyotens:&#160;?
 MSmits: ah, no idea
 struct: well its working for me
 MSmits: is it rust?
 Noyotens: nope, c#
 MSmits: then i got nuthin'
 struct: you cant break bots anymore with rust
 MSmits: maybe you haven't tried hard enough
 struct: you can but it will also break your arena one
 struct: Do I even need to store all apps?
 MSmits: what do you mean?
 MSmits: in your gamestate?
 struct: Yeah
 MSmits: no. Store a minimum of 12 bits that flip when an app is finished
 MSmits: or if you're lazy like i have been, a bool[12]
 struct: but you still need to for each app
 struct: if you sum all apps together you dont need to loop
 struct: ah doesnt work
 struct: im dumb
 MSmits: well
 struct: How do I delete a message?
 MSmits: actually you can get away with 1 integer
 MSmits: just set it to -1 for no app finished
 MSmits: and then to 3 if you finished app 3 etc.
 struct: I think ill do the 12 bit thing
 MSmits: works too
 struct: Thanks MSmits
 MSmits: np
 Nerchio: the duck is slowly climbing since gold opened lol
 jacek: he didnt submit since fix?
 Nerchio: nah
 Scarfield: what was fixed?
 struct: Gold opened with alpha version
 Scarfield: so same version in silver?
 eulerscheZahl: bugs. french statement only. other input format
 Scarfield: ah nothing "changed" then, but gold opened with wrong version and that got fixed?
 struct: it will only change in legend
 Scarfield: what, so gold has a different format?
 eulerscheZahl: no, league opening was bugged. but now it's all good
 Illedan: Losing a game 5-2 in Last battles and winning 5-1 in IDE -.-
 struct: cant relate
 Nerchio: cant relate I always win in and outside of IDE
 JohnyDaison: Illedan if you're testing against Psyho you will almost never get the same game even with the same seed
 emh: I succumbed to desire. energy drink it is. maybe it will be a coding night
 eulerscheZahl: illedan might be random himself
 eulerscheZahl: i know him well enough to expect exactly that
 Ay1man1: how do you xor two numbers wtf\
 Psyho: "An error occurred (#407): "You reached the limit of plays for a period of time."." damn
 Ay1man1: just had a coding clash i could not understand
 Psyho: so apparently 20 games is the limit in short time 
 jacek: Ay1man1 a^b
 jacek: or make NN for that
 Ay1man1: like a to the power of b?
 struct: it will get lower and lower Psyho and cooldown will increase
 jacek: ^ in most languages is xor
 struct: if it keeps getting spammed
 Ay1man1: oh...
 elderlybeginner: What are "automated" cards in the contest?
 eulerscheZahl: there are many play limits for time spans up to 24h
 Illedan: eulerscheZahl, I'm full random :P
 putibuzu: elderlybeginner basically cards that you put next to your hand for the rest of the game and can use them for releasing apps, but you cannot play them for the effect anymore
 JohnyDaison: Illedan, are you serious or not? If you are 47th with RANDOM, something is very wrong.
 Illedan: ..
 struct: he doesnt mean output random
 eulerscheZahl: ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 MSmits: noooo
 struct: ..
 Illedan: I do rollouts like psyh o
 MSmits: onl no heuristics
 eulerscheZahl: Illedan provoked me
 Illedan: But fully random
 MSmits: just random moves
 IroncladDev: what in the world are all these lines?
 struct: So its just normal monte carlo?
 MSmits: should be easy to transition from your method to psyho's
 MSmits: IroncladDev they are euler's sick sense of humor :P
 Illedan: Yeah, 2 lines of code. It worked ok, but my heuristic is not as good
 IroncladDev: interesting
 Illedan: I have heuristic for the enemy
 eulerscheZahl: this alone is a reason to keep the chat. where else should i spam ̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤̤
 mlomb: how many rollouts are you getting? :eyes:
 Illedan: 500 :D
 mlomb: nice
 eulerscheZahl: do you simulate solo-play or with the opponent moving too?
 kovi: you run till end of game
 kovi:&#160;?
 Psyho: wait you get 500 full games in 50ms with just random moves?
 jacek: Automaton2000 did you see that?
 Automaton2000: did you get to the same state
 Psyho: 500 is not a lot
 struct: 500 seems low doesnt it?
 Illedan: I know :P
 struct: ok
 Illedan: Very low
 PatrickMcGinnisII: spam chain Automaton2000
 Psyho: veryyyyy lowwwww
 Automaton2000: nothing to do with it?
 Psyho: I get few times more and my heuristic is the bottleneck
 MSmits: Illedan when you do the movegenerator don't make all sorts of temporary objects like Lists and such
 Illedan: Nah
 Illedan: I count all spells that I can do
 Illedan: Random on the amount
 Illedan: Then count again until I find the one I wanted
 MSmits: I see
 MSmits: weird that it is so slow
 MSmits: it is C#, but still
 Illedan: I didn't optimize it yet
 Illedan: Just got stuff working last night
 MSmits: ah ok, i didnt optimize mine still and i got it working on sunday :P
 kovi: thought you did 1 move only?
 Illedan: Kid + work + wedding soon doesn't help on my time schedule :P
 MSmits: i turn yes, but thats a move, throw, give, x plays and a release, bruteforced
 eulerscheZahl: and you can't just ditch one of those 3 without affecting the others
 eulerscheZahl: kid for adoption but wedding still going won't work
 MSmits: is the wedding because of the kid?
 Illedan: Quit work? Then I can't afford wedding?
 putibuzu: :D
 JohnyDaison: Hey Psyho, I just got your bot to time out
 MSmits: JohnyDaison if people run close to the timelimit, some inaccuracies make you occasionally go over. It might not be a bug
 Psyho: thanks for the info, unfortunately it's not reproducible
 MSmits: you usually leave a 5ms buffer or something
 MSmits: his buffer could be too small
 Psyho: I'm using 45 ms
 MSmits: yeah sometimes that could not be enough
 MSmits: very rarely
 Psyho: but there's also a much it just crashed
 Psyho: *a chance
 MSmits: yeah hard to say
 MSmits: sometimes it outputs the time even when you are out of time and you can tell
 MSmits: say you used 52 ms or something
 struct: i usually leave a 0.5ms buffer
 Psyho: I don't think I ever use more than 46ms, so my bet is on crashing
 MSmits: structed i just compared a 2 play limited bot to a 3 play limited bot. It had a WR of 40%
 MSmits: struct i mean
 MSmits: so the play limit does affect my game
 eulerscheZahl: there are these dots below the viewer that let you see your logs. if you are lucky, it points you to a line in your code<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/7ctQkjt.png">https://i.imgur.com/7ctQkjt.png</a>
 struct: maybe the type of timer could be difeferent
 Psyho: oh btw about that: is there any easy way of getting the log of all of the games that I played?
 Psyho: seems like the easiest way to find crashes
 struct: I use high_resolution_clock
 eulerscheZahl: you have to write your own scraper
 Psyho: damn
 eulerscheZahl: download all replays, check for negative score
 Illedan: You have to script it Psyho. Because only you can see your debug printing
 Psyho: don't you have a jar for that mr jar dealer? :D
 Astrobytes: lol
 struct: Does your tech io tutorial still works eulerscheZahl?
 eulerscheZahl: we agreed not to share such software as we fear that CG will limit it when it gets too popular
 Psyho: makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/53705/contest-tools-and-workflow/introduction</a>
 eulerscheZahl: a quick how-to with some code. but nothing ready to use
 eulerscheZahl: the play limit you hit earlier is a result of automated testing taking too much resources
 struct: books -_-
 Psyho: thanks, that's actually more than enough
 Psyho: and yay for python instead of java
 jacek: jython?
 eulerscheZahl: pyava - to combine the worst of both worlds
 Illedan: pyava++?
 Psyho: speed of python with flexibility of java? :D
 eulerscheZahl: the enterprise slow language
 MSmits: it's not as good as Roofie
 MSmits: (Groovy + Ruby)
 Astrobytes: where did the 'fie' come from?
 MSmits: it sounds the same
 Astrobytes: v&#160;!= f
 MSmits: pfft details
 Astrobytes: *pvvt
 MSmits:  :)
 Astrobytes: heh
 MSmits: kovi did you end up bitboarding this?
 kovi: not yet
 MSmits: I am trying to think of an effective way, but it doesnt even fit in int32
 MSmits: a hand
 kovi: im also still 1 move only, no speed problem
 MSmits: did you not limit your plays?
 MSmits: the limit hurts me a bit
 kovi: i use heuristics to cut it
 MSmits: oh ok, i just limited it to 3. If i lower the limit to 2, my bot gets 40% WR so it's significant. Not sure if a limit of 4 would be much better
 MSmits: i should just do it iteratively. start at 3, then try 4, 5 etc.
 MSmits: most turns it should just hit the max np
 struct: Nice I made it to gold :D
 MSmits: welcome struct&#160;:)
 JohnyDaison: welcome
 struct: Thanks
 struct: I just add to open euler referee for brutaltester
 struct: changed 1 param and got 70%, changed another and got 70% vs the previous 2
 MSmits: nice
 struct: wow psy has a huge lead
 BrunoFelthes: full game search
 struct: maybe I should start going further than 1 round
 MSmits: you could, but you'd still be limited to eval. Psy ho's method is using the endgame result as eval, thereby circumventing the need for eval
 Psyho: I mean, I wouldn't say the only my method is the way to go
 Psyho: I had the same approach two days ago
 Psyho: it's just that this morning I set up a local league system + some semi-automated way of parameter search and I'm 60K of local games later
 struct: well time to rent a vm again
 Psyho: and that messed up leaderboard makes it look like I have a huge lead (honestly I'm confused at this point why I still have a 3 point lead)
 Psyho: duck is finally in top 10 though
 struct: maybe we should wait for duck submit
 Nerchio: yea but he didnt even submit xD
 Psyho: I have a version that's ~0.9 higher locally, but I don't want to ruin my unfair lead&#160;:(
 MSmits: There's a duck on my tails!
 emh: I wonder if I should write a new bot with sim (in C++) but I'm too chill at the moment
 MSmits: more caffeine
 emh: hehe I'm already immune to caffeine without taking a break I suspect MSmits. mostly. could be that 0.5l more of energy drink would help
 struct: he just drank 10 coffees worth of caffeine
 emh: 160 mg in one can
 MSmits: i cant take much of that
 struct: I dont have good experiences with energy drinks
 Nerchio: i stopped drinking coffee and I have more energy than before so there's that
 emh: I stopped drinking coffee also because I don't feel like the taste, and also because it's acidic for stomach. well I don't know if energy drink is any better for stomach but at least I love the sugar taste
 Astrobytes: energy drinks are terrible for the stomach. I stopped more than 1 or 2 cups a day of coffee as my pain meds wreck my stomach enough as it is
 Illedan: The play limit is annoying -.-
 Astrobytes: Very.
 Illedan: Using submits to tests small changes
 Illedan: -.-
 struct: havent reach it yet
 struct: reached*
 struct: I think its mod benefit
 Illedan: riiight
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: lol
 Kellthazar: does the play limit counts for tests in arena only?
 Sheeesh---: what's the distance between desks&#160;?
 struct: any arena
 Sheeesh---: how to know*
 Illedan: 42 meters Sheeesh---
 struct: I simply do t2-t1
 Illedan: And the pawn walk at 6 km/h speed
 Sheeesh---: how about velocity&#160;?
 jacek: -3vel
 jacek: :tada:
 Sheeesh---: thank you&#160;!
 Quidome: how to get out of wood 2??
 Sheeesh---: use if statement
 Razovsky: lets go Snef
 Quidome: I always beat the boss and can't get high enough
 BrunoFelthes: first valid move Quidome
 Quidome: really??
 BrunoFelthes: try
 Quidome: hm, thnxs, will try that
 Snef: Razovsky let's hope i don't drop 
 struct: Quidome first move got people up to silver
 struct: but its probably not possible anymore
 jacek: now its 2nd action
 Quidome: ok, i am on it
 BrunoFelthes: really? do they changed it?
 BrunoFelthes: first move to 5, second to CI, help a lot to
 BrunoFelthes: always that is possible to do a move to 5 and a Cont Int 8, do it... and then, random
 Quidome: servers are really fast this time, nice!
 Quidome: first move is not working
 Quidome: Am i being trolled here??
 Astrobytes: no, it really was a thing
 jacek: i would never troll
 Quidome: really annoying, i looks as too much random to me
 Quidome: jacek, sorry
 jacek: :upside_down:
 antiwonto: [auto] ':upside_down:' was defined as ' ɥǝllo '
 Quidome: can't think of a simple strategy to get out of there
 Quidome: second move also no good
 jacek: there is some boss code on github, isnt it
 Quidome: I beat the boss, but I am not getting a high enough ranking
 ilgiocatore: Quidome automate bonus cards as much as you can
 BrunoFelthes: move to 5, 6. CI 8. otherwise random?
 BrunoFelthes: CR too
 Quidome: what do you mean by automate bonus cards
 BrunoFelthes: yes, stack automated bonus
 Quidome: is that a rule in wood 2?
 BrunoFelthes: no?
 ilgiocatore: oh
 Quidome: ok i am gonna read again...
 BrunoFelthes: i really do not remember, i pass using random moves :P
 ilgiocatore: yeah, in wood 2 you can only move and release?
 BrunoFelthes: me
 BrunoFelthes: in wood 2 you need to give card?
 BrunoFelthes: never give a card
 Quidome: only move and release indeed
 Quidome: :rage:
 BrunoFelthes: so, never wait, just move random, and release random... span the tests
 Illedan: Move (position+1)%8Count Cards in hand, release best option
 BrunoFelthes: you go to gold that way
 Illedan: Silver, if you do random on the skill turn :D
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://grugbrain.dev/">https://grugbrain.dev/</a>
 Michael_Howard: Wow, did they just add a Gold server?
 Nerchio: you could also bruteforce all possible positions until the end of the game and evaluate them somehow
 Quidome: is there some strategy in this game when you have all te rules?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: grats, that was close huh
 Illedan: Nerchio, evaluate is not a problem when you get that far .P
 darkhorse64: small margin but it was my first try farming CI
 Illedan: From that webpage ^danger, however, is agile shaman! many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman!
 Michael_Howard: I hope the servers are this fast on Sunday :rocket:
 Illedan: Lol
 Illedan: No chance
 Illedan: 800 submits pending all day
 Illedan: Hmm, my code is better without the enemy -.- Makes no sense as he now just stands still somewhere
 jacek: good, less states to eval
 Ahmed_King: hello

 antiwonto: [auto] hey Ahmed_King dont paste those links here.  Use the channel #clash
 Quidome: after a few submits with the same code I am now at position 6. Variation roughly 259 places...
 Quidome: Is it better to wait or keep on submitting?
 Illedan: Better to fix the code
 Quidome: I am talking wood 2 here randomness is the issue here
 Quidome: well, I am gonna sleep over it, it's very frustrating never had is in a previous contest
 Quidome: gl
 MSmits: it is an obstacle you can get past
 MSmits: gn
 Michael_Howard: Server at normal speed again. Were they just testing something before?
 Michael_Howard: They'd upped the number of battles too.
 Michael_Howard: It was like several hundred.
 Westicles: so I get this big list of choices to release, is it important which one?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: well it's all relative
 MSmits: it's not the most important thing
 MSmits: but your deck and the available apps affect the probability of you being able to release in the future
 Westicles: I don't think I can figure it out without reading part of the statement
 MSmits: you need to read the entire thing and then question everything 
 Illedan: I got a 5 min youtube video which explains everything
 Illedan: For the boardgame
 Illedan: far more logical
 Westicles: ok let's see it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Westicles minimize tech_debt acquisition for release...wait is also an option
 Psyho: rulebook is online for samsara: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162892/samsara-game-rules">https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/162892/samsara-game-rules</a>

 Illedan: Glad we don't have the abilities on the characters as the game has
 Psyho: honestly the game is really meh, I find it hard to comprehend that it has a decent score on BGG
 Illedan: Yeah, too simple for my taste in board games
 Psyho: it's very unintuitive for humans, endgame is very simulation-based, rules are overcomplicated, there isn't too much depth, every game is similar, there aren't too many strategies
 Psyho: imho it doesn't work as a casual game (too complex rules) nor as a competitive games (lack of depth)
 Westicles: every time you use your new phone it'll put you in a bad mood
 j4at: its pretty much a casual luck game.
 JohnyDaison: You know what would be really useful? If it showed in history for each version what rank it was before it was replaced.
 BrunoFelthes: game history could have a lot of improvements
 BrunoFelthes: but there is an extension that you can add a text for each history
 PatrickMcGinnisII: omg, i beat silver boss, but it timed out! wth
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey PatrickMcGinnisII, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 61 tacos
 struct: 4 days to get to legend
 gjin25: hello everyone
 struct: hi
 Psyho: isn't it 4 days till the end of the contest?
 gjin25: I'm new and i have start the green circle competition
 j4at: 4 days and 20 hours and 30 minutes
 j4at: Psycho
 struct: yes Psyho but I need all the time I have to reach legend :p
 Psyho: 🤣
 Psyho: that's the ugliest ROFL emoji I have ever seen!
 struct: lol
 struct: but it describes it perfectly
 Crosility: :fearful:
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: can someone explain what happens when you play a daily routine card?
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: "the team can get their new skill card from a desk one step away"
 struct: When you move
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: do they get to choose?
 BrunoFelthes: at the next move
 struct: You can do MOVE 6 5
 struct: to move to 6 and get card on cell 5
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: oh ok and so the more you have the further the distance away from your actual location you can take a card?
 struct: yes
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: awesome thanks
 struct: But it resets to 0 when you release an app
 NotSureWhyThisWorks: yep
 PatrickMcGinnisII: can't get above 79th in silver atm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: need break
 BrunoFelthes: why there is a daily routine count?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: laterz
 struct: what do you mean bruno?
 BrunoFelthes: you can stack daily routines
 struct: yeah
 BrunoFelthes: at the tooltip there is a daily routines number
 BrunoFelthes: you said that its reset to zero
 BrunoFelthes: is that true?
 struct: when you release an app
 struct: ye
 struct: " it stays active until the team has released one application."
 BrunoFelthes: so, why there is a number, not a boolean?
 struct: same for architecture
 struct: because you can stack it
 BrunoFelthes: no, architecture is a stack
 struct: if you use daily routine 2 times
 struct: you can take from 2 cells away
 BrunoFelthes: ok
 Westicles: There is only on puzzle with two approvals, and it is a hardcore combinational math one you'll never solve without googling
 antiwonto: [auto] Hey Westicles, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 113 tacos
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/21267833d34ef960c94d60f4bb5c5f70f7926">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/21267833d34ef960c94d60f4bb5c5f70f7926</a>
 emh: Westicles I understand the task but not the solution. should I approve it then?
 emh: I need to approve something for my collaboration level
 Westicles: It is up to you.  I think it is pretty safe to approve, I came up with the same solution with a different approach
 emh: ohh.. there is a checkbox that I came up with a working solution.. can't say that I did. so no
 Westicles: good form
 emh: is there something easy I could solve and approve?
 Westicles: yes!
 Astrobytes: very math-y puzzle indeed.
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/22125008becf442406a264e2a0b4950fbd3af">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/22125008becf442406a264e2a0b4950fbd3af</a>
 Astrobytes: only you could have come up with that :D
 Westicles: heh heh
 emh: when I was 10 years old I ran after the girls in school and tried to kiss them
 Astrobytes: I know someone who did worse than that, me and another mate reminded him at a party once and he didn't speak to us for a year :D
 elderlybeginner: what are permanent skills for (contest)?
 j4at: Ow I found a way the check the type of incoming clash :o
 Astrobytes: they're stackable skills, they stack until you release an app. e.g. daily routine can let you do a move n m, where m == daily_routine_count
 Westicles: j4at in time to leave before it starts?
 Astrobytes: and architecture study gives you m cards at the start of the turn
 j4at: you don't even need to join to check the type
 Westicles: wow, you'll be a hero, you should post it on the forum
 j4at: hehe
 Astrobytes: doesn't sound high priority to me :P
 elderlybeginner: It's my intellectual fitness decreasing or the contest is lousy described
 Astrobytes: it's lousily described
 Westicles: it is a reverse contest, you shouldn't read it.  though I'm having trouble getting into gold
 elderlybeginner: Astrobytes, why not both :wink:
 Astrobytes: lol, well after looking at it for some time it's possible that intellectual fitness may be somewhat diminished :D
 Westicles: I'm doing move+1 if available, else first move in list.  What should I add?
 Astrobytes: -3*vel
 Westicles: hey, thanks emh!
 elderlybeginner: what's '-3*vel'?
 emh: yw
 Astrobytes: CSB trick elderlybeginner
 Zandy156: if your only skill card in hand is a task prioritization, what play_card action can you do?
 Astrobytes: I don't believe you can...
 Zandy156: so only wait?
 Astrobytes: I would presume so, yes
 Zandy156: I thought it was supposed to be automatic if we had no choice.
 Westicles: j4at, you aren't going to share the trick?
 j4at: I'm going to write a script that shows the type of the clash&#160;;)
 Westicles: amazing what they do with scripts, I ran the one that scrapes all your puzzle solutions, took just over 3 hours
 Zandy156: oh, you can trade bonus skill cards with task prioritization 
 Astrobytes: You can.
 Zandy156: not sure if that's a good move
 Astrobytes: try it and see, I don't know anything any more lol
 oidrissi: Hey guys, any one made a scoring system for the possible moves? I want to implement one and am struggling a bit with the whole scoring part
 Westicles: I can tell you always choosing the first one works &gt;&gt; better than choosing the second or last
 Kellthazar: The better Golang solution is in rank 106, interesting. 
 Westicles: but that is probably a wait/random artifact
 Kellthazar: More Rust competitors as well.
 oidrissi: @Westicles Are you answering me or something else? ^^
 Westicles: it isn't a direct answer to your question, but related I guess
 Westicles: I suspect if someone answered your question it would be like 50 pages of details
 oidrissi: Agreed, too much data to handle
 elderlybeginner: Can you determine appox./mean value of play_card action?
 elderlybeginner: e.g. coding is usually better then daily_rounine
 elderlybeginner: kind of rank paly_card actions
 therealbeef: oidrissi I think everyone is working on this. the winner will probably just have figured out the best move evaluation
 therealbeef: mine is rubbish at the moment

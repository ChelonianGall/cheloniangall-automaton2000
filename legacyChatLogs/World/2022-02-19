 antiwonto: [automated] Hey Ninjatron, here is a :taco: for loggin in today while it is quiet.  You now have 1 tacos
 Mortis_666: wow
 Ninjatron: wow what?
 frosi: jajaj
 frosi: Hi everyone
 destroyerofworldz: whos online
 destroyerofworldz: anybody want to video chat
 Ninjatron: are you a female?
 5DN1L: please stick to coding-related topics, destroyerofworldz
 5DN1L: and Ninjatron too
 destroyerofworldz: why

 Ninjatron: because why would any guy want to video chat another guy? :D
 5DN1L: if you continue to disrupt the chat i'll kick you out
 destroyerofworldz: dont
 destroyerofworldz: i want to video chat to pair program
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :poultry_leg:
 Ninjatron: oh pair progrmming
 Ninjatron: the worst invention ever
 Teehee12345: agreed
 Teehee12345: especially when you are pairing with someone named Sophie&#160;:/
 Ninjatron: the problem is, i get sleepy when i am watching someone else program, and get distracted if someone else watches me lol
 Ninjatron: ok so what is wrong with this:class TrieNode {private:
 Ninjatron: it gives me clang warning, but this is how i always created trie nodes
 therealbeef: which warning?
 Ninjatron: nvm gone after finishing the class
 Ninjatron: when did this site launch?
 abt8601: Wikipedia says the company launched in 2012
 Miki09: :taco: Wontonimo
 Ninjatron: a question about bot racing
 Ninjatron: i don't know genetic algorithms etc.
 Ninjatron: is the learning part effectively ordered or do i just need to randomly figure things out?
 5DN1L: For Wood League you don't need it
 Ninjatron: how do i improve though? say i want to learn, am i supposed to find sources or are there tutorials?
 5DN1L: yes, on the front page of the puzzle you get some external links
 Ninjatron: alright thanks
 therealbeef: also check the 'discussion' link (if it has one) that can be very useful to learn how other people have approached it
 therealbeef: it leads to the forum
 Ninjatron: i don't like forums, it leads to too much wasteful reading
 Ninjatron: but thanks for the recommendation, i will use it if i get stuck

 Wontonimo: it can take up to 3 weeks DevTenga , be patient with contribution approval
 DevTenga: Womtonimo, I'm sorry if I sounded impatient, I was just trying to promote myself &gt;.&lt;
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: I've frustrating.  I get it.  I've been sitting on a contribution for a while.  I think I've had it in the works for about a month.  It's crazy making
 Wontonimo: I took a look DevTenga, there are a lot of ascii to num Clashes.  Without an original storyline or problem, it's going to be hard to get upvotes.
 DevTenga: Wontonimo, It's just the bytes_to_long function used in RSA, please take a look at the comments. So sorry for the ambiguity &gt;.&lt;
 BlaiseEbuth: Pretty bad idea... Though the intention is laudable.
 DevTenga: It was supposed to be for encouraging interest in CTFs
 Wontonimo: then write that up in the description!  advertise that
 jacek: CTF?
 BlaiseEbuth: Capture the flag
 DevTenga: Wontonimo, it's a reverse puzzle :sweat_smile:
 Wontonimo: Control The Frog
 DevTenga: bruh
 Wontonimo: ah, it's an inside joke about hypno toads
 DevTenga: oh okay
 DevTenga: btw Wontonimo, look at the initials of the title.
 DevTenga: I made it ambiguous intentionally :wink: cuz I only played CTFs before this
 BlaiseEbuth: DevTenga, as someone say in the comments you don't see the title in reverse mode. So it's just a "guess what algo i used" clash.
 DevTenga: Okay, I'll include the title in the body
 struct: make one or two easier testcases then it might be feasible
 struct: like one letter only and then two letters only
 Wontonimo: I'm certainly not an expert on getting upvotes.  Looking at my contributions that have gotten some good upvotes I can see a trend.  A good backstory and something original is going to get more traction than the opposite
 Wontonimo: for example <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/beach-volleyball">https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/beach-volleyball</a>
 Wontonimo: did really well for me
 Wontonimo: with +14
 struct: One thing is that on reverse you dont even have access to statement
 struct: nor title
 BlaiseEbuth: ^
 DevTenga: owah
 Wontonimo: and here's one that got +22 <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/wave-function-collapse-sans-shannon">https://www.codingame.com/training/hard/wave-function-collapse-sans-shannon</a>
 DevTenga: Time to make it not reverse lol
 Wontonimo: a lot of write up, a lot of back story
 Wontonimo: totally original
 DevTenga: hehe
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah yeah you're the best Wontonimo, go make your badge brighter.
 DevTenga: I got my school finals this year, I'll try to get more into writing soon
 Wontonimo: that's unnecessary BlaiseEbuth and unhelpful
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh. Didn't saw you were helping, I thought it was an auto-advertising session...
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: salt must flow
 Automaton2000: didn't want to do this
 Wontonimo: one of my worst contributions with lots of downvotes was a caesar cipher.  Not original at all.  there are dozens of similar contributions
 BlaiseEbuth: Btw DevTenga, remove unicode chars from your tests.
 jacek: Wontonimo have you tried caesar cipher with shifting of... 4
 Zorg1: :heart_eyes:
 Wontonimo: oh wow, 4.  No, that's sounds way hard.  I made it up to 3 one time
 jacek: lets make double rot13
 Miki09: My personal best is +16 upvotes on 3d printer

 SarcasmKing: when i use "BOOST" in mad pod racing ai it doesnt work
 5DN1L: what is shown in the console
 Momotron23: hey 
 EthanX2323: hi
 SarcasmKing: normal things @5DN1L
 SarcasmKing: its just i cant see the boost
 SarcasmKing: the boss boosts its bot just fine but mine doesnt boost
 5DN1L: Did you use boost more than once?
 SarcasmKing: no
 SarcasmKing: ohhhh
 SarcasmKing: lemme tri somehting'
 SarcasmKing: um.... noepe its not wrking
 SarcasmKing: pls help
 SarcasmKing: @5DN1L?
 5DN1L: how do you know boost isn't working? you tried comparing how fast your pod moved if you used a number instead?
 SarcasmKing: i think its not working because the bot seemingly moves faster than my bot for sometime and then stablizes
 SarcasmKing: slowers it speed
 5DN1L: share a replay here?
 SarcasmKing: how?
 SarcasmKing: o ye

 SarcasmKing: nearly at frame 20 the boss bot uses the thrust
 5DN1L: which turn did you use boost
 SarcasmKing: idk
 5DN1L: if you did not output boost, why would your pod's speed be boosted?
 SarcasmKing: i have just written if distance between pod and checkpoint is more than 1000 then thrust is boost
 SarcasmKing: "BOOST"
 5DN1L: maybe your code never reaches that line
 5DN1L: you have to check again
 SarcasmKing: how?
 5DN1L: if the "if" condition is never satisfied
 SarcasmKing: one sec

 SarcasmKing: ik that the map is 16000 pixels wide so its not possibe
 5DN1L: You're given the distance in inputs right?
 Wontonimo: you can go off the map , to -200,000 if you want
 5DN1L: You can output it in the error stream to check SarcamKing

 Wontonimo: zoom zoom ... get around those checkpoints
 SarcasmKing: ITS NOT WOTKIRNSAKFJ

 5DN1L: Do you see the battles there?
 5DN1L: Your bot is entered into the arema
 5DN1L: arena*
 SarcasmKing: yes?
 5DN1L: and competes against other players' bots
 5DN1L: that determines the score of your bot
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: I remember when Wontonimo used to be this patient :thinking:
 5DN1L: only if your bot's score is higher than the boss of that league
 5DN1L: then you will be promoted
 SarcasmKing: so when i win a certain amount of times i will advance in lvls?
 SarcasmKing: ooo
 SarcasmKing: so how i see boss score?
 5DN1L: click LEADERBOARD
 SarcasmKing: kliced
 SarcasmKing: oo
 5DN1L: The boss is at the top
 SarcasmKing: ok
 SarcasmKing: im not even close
 5DN1L: Your battles are still running

 antiwonto: [automated] EulerscheZahI has awarded Pupper_Gump 10 tacos. Pupper_Gump now has 10 taco. EulerscheZahI now has 11 taco
 Pupper_Gump: yay
 Pupper_Gump: :pizza: is better
 Scarfield: whats pizza
 Scarfield: hmm that should have made antiwonto say something :thinking:
 Pupper_Gump: Pizza is a sandwich
 ShamsSyHo: im so bad 
 Pupper_Gump: how come
 ShamsSyHo: i tried so hard to learn coding but i am so bad
 Pupper_Gump: Well I've been working with one language for a year or so and barely got the basics down
 ShamsSyHo: that's what im doing 
 Pupper_Gump: Just keep trying, I recommend working with lower level (simpler) languages like C to make you think like a computer does
 ShamsSyHo: i dont have the logic of programming
 Pupper_Gump: There are other ways to practice thinking logically. There's a game called 'make it true' on the app store which is pretty good
 ShamsSyHo: js&#160;? should i start with&#160;?
 Pupper_Gump: I personally think js is just a library collection rather than a real language
 ShamsSyHo: Igonna try it now
 Pupper_Gump: ok just try to look through your code step by step and take it slow when learning
 ShamsSyHo: Reallythank you so much i really appreciate it
 Scarfield: Pupper_Gump which language have you tried learning?
 Pupper_Gump: cpp/c
 Scarfield: oh sorry, meant to ping ShamsSyHo
 Pupper_Gump:&#160;:/
 ShamsSyHo: ah, i was at the university in france so i learnt C, python, Java, js, php 
 Pupper_Gump: So if you've got the basics just try working on one project for awhile and make it as good as you can
 ShamsSyHo: But when I want to practice or do a small thing kind of project , i see that i know no thing
 Pupper_Gump: Then just learn it all along the way
 ShamsSyHo: i tried to do a cv online with javascript 
 ShamsSyHo: and i didnt finish it because i have some problems 
 ShamsSyHo: Should I to learn firstly algo or i can start directly with js&#160;? 
 ShamsSyHo: I am really sorry gays but i really need help, like some advices 
 Pupper_Gump: I personally think that it depends on what you're trying to do. js is good for websites, but making software or apps is built on programming logic not found in js (such as c/cpp, java, python, etc)
 Pupper_Gump: If you have any coding friends go to them for advice, they could help you more than us
 ShamsSyHo: i would like to become  a web dev
 ShamsSyHo: i already did that, and one of his advice was to show someone coding ,than can improve my skils, and there we are ...
 Pupper_Gump: I'm not experienced in making websites, but from my little experience I know that it takes a lot of studying of other libraries. Have you tried looking at the w3schools website? They've got some good tutorials
 ShamsSyHo: no actually, i will se that. Mayb that will help me
 ShamsSyHo: thank u so much bro&#160;! 
 Pupper_Gump: ok try your best
 ShamsSyHo: :grin:

 GrisTran: lol
 William_Dau: Just discovered this website 
 William_Dau: Looks so cool&#160;!
 Pupper_Gump: Yeah it's pretty chill
 Pupper_Gump: well back to watching codingtrain lol
 Wontonimo: cool, welcome to this website
 Wontonimo: as soon as you can try out the bot battles William_Dau  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>
 Wontonimo: the "intro" bot battle is Mad Pod Racing
 antiwonto: [automated] Sorry Wontonimo but there is already a definition for that

 Wontonimo: all i've done lately on this site is to make a taco economy.  haven't really been doing any multis or puzzles.
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: didn't the economy collapse now that you can't spend them?
 Wontonimo: it's an economy, not necessarily a good one.
 michaellan: 'tis a zero-sum game
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: Tacos from each according to his ability, tacos to each according to his needs
 Pupper_Gump: tacos randomly
 Wontonimo: there were once a time before there were tacos, then Antiwonto said "Let there be tacos", and the tacos flowed.  And it was good
 Pupper_Gump: Then God smited him for godly impersonation
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: He's canadian, they don't have God
 Pupper_Gump: Yeah they do it's Trudeau
 Wontonimo: no invisible all powerful white old man lives in the clouds where I live.  Maybe it's the weather here
 ASM_MOV_INT: is he visible at your place?
 ASM_MOV_INT: un-non-invisible
 ASM_MOV_INT: lol
 Wontonimo: there isn't one here.  do you have a non-invisible old white guy living in the clouds above you?
 Wontonimo: you still there xxd&#160;?
 ASM_MOV_INT: lol, i'm at work, so distracted with a bunch of things....!
 Pupper_Gump: Yeah I forgot some people have alife
 michaellan: i'm here, i guess&#160;: )
 Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker: fresh back from the clouds

 ASM_MOV_INT: don't you feel like you already know all of programming, just syntax and function names are different
 Pupper_Gump: Not really, programming is like math. Basic rules, so many implementations
 Awesomeguy99ab: true
 SarcasmKing: AM BAC
 ASM_MOV_INT: i feel like you said not true, but gave the exact reason it's true .... rofl
 ASM_MOV_INT: my favorite clashes are the reverse mode
 Paul1806: How do i play reverse mode?
 SarcasmKing: i think u 
 SarcasmKing: go to the clash game thingy
 SarcasmKing: and it randomly givess u the mode
 Paul1806: oh so its random
 Paul1806: ok thanks
 SarcasmKing: i think
 nulte: yes

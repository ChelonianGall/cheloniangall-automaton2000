 jrke: what can i add in PR2
 Pappu_Kumar_Pashi: Hi, Everyone Hope you all are doing well :blush:Let's be friends
 LelouchVC2: WE can NEVER be friends
 jacek: :O
 WINWINWIN: jacek, did not enjoy the contest?
 jacek: didnt get hooked up really
 jacek: but i dont enjoy contests overall
 eulerscheZahl: you are a board game player
 jacek: eeyup
 FaizanRizvi: hi
 jacek: ohai
 FaizanRizvi: has anyone solved ANEO Sponsored Puzzle?
 WINWINWIN: I have
 jacek: ok i fiddled with pr2. now im at top half
 eulerscheZahl: not that impressive tbh
 Astrobytes: I got to 234th and got a bit bored
 Astrobytes: Might go back to it, if it wasn't for the 'contest' I probably wouldn't have started it so, all good I guess
 WINWINWIN: Othello released today morning
 WINWINWIN: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5106941b8347f7341a4dbe2f39dabce52586">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5106941b8347f7341a4dbe2f39dabce52586</a>
 WINWINWIN: Looks perfect
 Astrobytes: Yea I know, I'm 1st :P
 Astrobytes: He's done a good job
 cegprakash: The aim of this game is to win.
 cegprakash: You lose if:You mess up.
 wlesavo: standart statement
 cegprakash: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 wlesavo: it is great though
 cegprakash: aren't games made to have fun?
 cegprakash: "The aim of this game is to win." sounds harsh to noob players like me
 cegprakash: who play for fun
 Astrobytes: cegprakash it's just the default HTML, he's not done the statement yet
 MSmits: cegprakash wants it to be: "This game has no aim, enjoy!"
 MSmits: btw, guess what this is:
 Astrobytes: Also "noob players like me who play for fun" - ceg?!
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a3b6027-a402-414b-a606-ede6b68e1621">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a3b6027-a402-414b-a606-ede6b68e1621</a>
 MSmits: I ran out of memory after n = 21&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Oware endgames?
 MSmits: yep!
 Astrobytes: Jeez lol
 MSmits: i just enumerated them, i didnt solve 
 Astrobytes: That's... a few
 MSmits: it might be crazy hard to solve seeds over 10
 MSmits: because of loops
 MSmits: so i doubt memory is the bottleneck here
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I'd imagine that'd be the case
 Astrobytes: brb
 Astrobytes: back, doctor checking up on me
 MSmits: ah, ok, hope it's getting better
 Astrobytes: Nah, no change. MRI on Tuesday. Most probably a bulging disc
 MSmits: can do they help you with that?
 Astrobytes: Depends. That's just one option (the most likely one). Depending on severity then surgery is the last resort. Otherwise, physiotherapy and pain management
 MSmits: I see
 Astrobytes: Can only speculate until the MRI, everything's hinging on the results
 MSmits: yeah I imagine 
 Astrobytes: Anyway, back to Oware endgames. Do you plan to try to create a book?
 MSmits: not sure if I will actually use it. It's not that useful inside of CG I think
 MSmits: could use it in a meta mcts though
 MSmits: but I first want to see how hard it is to deal with the loops
 Astrobytes: Yeah I was thinking that, could be your next long-term PC overheating project :P
 MSmits: problem with using it inside of CG is that you wont go beyond 6-7 seeds
 Astrobytes: Yep
 Astrobytes: Seems to help out tric trac though
 MSmits: Might not help him out at all, could just be his eval that is improving
 MSmits: i've seen him high before
 jacek: does he smoke? o.O
 Astrobytes: Beat me to it jacek
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: I think he said it was helpful
 Astrobytes: The book, not smoking that is
 MSmits: ah ok, then it;s a tradeoff between endgame book and opening book
 jacek: i benefit from opening book
 MSmits: maybe I'll do bothj
 jacek: i created it months ago, might as well update it
 MSmits: probably using half the size for one and half the size for the other is probably going to be better than either
 Astrobytes: I'd be interested in the results
 MSmits: I'm pretty sure an opening book here will wreck any opposition if I do it like i did it on uttt and yavalath. 
 MSmits: (the cheesy way)
 Astrobytes: It should wreak utter havoc with the NNs anyway
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: especially re curse's one I think
 MSmits: just have to find their one mistake. They're already losing games so there are mistakes
 MSmits: the best bots are easiest to counter because they play narrowly
 MSmits: but writing a good opening book generator that makes use of transpositions in this game is not that easy
 MSmits: you will want to combine results from gamestates with different scores, but same seed layout
 MSmits: and different turns
 Astrobytes: Yep. Nightmare
 MSmits: dont think jacek does this, but it could be good even without this. I'd want to use these transpositions though... purist
 Astrobytes: Definitely sounds like something you'd enjoy doing :P
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: Well, ultimately the transpositions are pretty important
 MSmits: it's hard to say, the game sure gives the impression that they are
 jacek: well i use transpositions
 jacek: but they are rarely happen in the beginning
 MSmits: do you use transpositions with different scores
 jacek: no
 MSmits: you can do that if you, instead of keeping the winrate, keep the expected seedcount from the current position
 MSmits: seedscore
 MSmits: it's messy and hard to implement but possible
 jacek: im doing alphabeta thing, not meta mcts
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: not sure how it would work in that case
 MSmits: thats the drop out expansion stuff right?
 jacek: yeah
 jacek: though not exactly as described there. i dont understand the algo *.*
 MSmits: i didnt get too much into it. I like meta mcts
 Astrobytes: drop-out expansion?
 Astrobytes: Is that the article thing on techio you did jacek?
 MSmits: it's a way to do meta-minimax 
 jacek: but i expand leaf based on their score - depth penalty. somewat like UCB
 MSmits: best first search 
 jacek: i wrote about meta mcts
 MSmits: yeah I know
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/146939/eth-25905-02.pdf">https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/146939/eth-25905-02.pdf</a>
 jacek: this is doe
 Astrobytes: cool, thx
 Astrobytes: Nice paper
 jacek: hmm he deals with cycles on endgame i think?
 MSmits: awari doesnt have cycles
 MSmits: it has a rule to resolve loops
 MSmits: thats why oware abapa is unsolvable
 MSmits: you can resolve loops with unlimited cpu, but it might involve going to a depth of 200 or something in some cases
 MSmits: it's kinda strange. the game has a tiny statespace but a giant tree complexity
 MSmits: for awari, both of those are tiny
 struct: Hello
 MSmits: hi
 Astrobytes: Hey
 Astrobytes: good job getting Othello up and running so quickly
 struct: Thanks, I still have some stuff done that I did not submit yet
 struct: Now the flip doesnt go outside the square
 jacek: phew
 haukc: hi hooman
 Uljahn: hi, Automaton2000's brother
 Automaton2000: that is a problem for me
 struct: Im not sure what time I set for Othello
 struct: I might increase it though
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/boUZeai.png">https://i.imgur.com/boUZeai.png</a>
 Astrobytes: Holy board size Batman
 struct: Are tooltips needed?
 MSmits: I think I speak for cegprakash when I say there should be a tooltip that reminds you to have fun
 eulerscheZahl: huh?
 MSmits: you missed that I guess&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i guess so too
 MSmits: he was criticizing the statement earlier
 MSmits: because it said the aim is to win&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: ah, the default statement
 MSmits: yes
 Astrobytes: Cause he's like the *least* competitive guy on CG :P
 jrke: any suggestion for PR2
 Mr_Luc1f3r: Guys are there any challenges without graphics?
 eulerscheZahl: there are puzzles without. but no multiplayer games
 Mr_Luc1f3r: Nice.How can i find these kind of puzzles?
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy</a>just open some. the community puzzles (with an author shown) are almost always without animations
 Mr_Luc1f3r: Ok thanks
 Astrobytes: jrke, not being funny but at a certain point you have to start trying to think of strategies by to improve by yourself. It's kinda the point
 struct: Soon I get sued for porting games
 struct: nice tomatoes top 5
 tomatoes: :blush:
 WINWINWIN: which multi tomatoes?
 tomatoes: uttt
 MSmits: gold?
 WINWINWIN: Really well done! I thought that the only non NN in UTTT top 5 was MSmits
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: thats oware and it's top 3
 MSmits: uttt has no succesful nn
 MSmits: re curse made a nn that is good enough for legend though
 WINWINWIN: Oh. So UTTT is only Minimax / MCTS?
 MSmits: as far as i know, yes
 MSmits: and it's mostly mcts variants, minimax is less succesful
 MSmits: but some are in/near top 10
 MSmits: it's notoriously hard to write a good eval for uttt which makes minimax worse than mcts at uttt
 MSmits: oh wow, it's actually legend uttt rank 5
 MSmits: that is really impressive tomatoes
 WINWINWIN: Understandable, there is only 1 easy factor of how many boxes controled
 MSmits: you can do 2 in a row and such
 WINWINWIN: But 2 in a row is not always a win chance, so you have to evaluate the whole board right?
 MSmits: I managed to get a working eval for early playout termination that is probably top 10 if i submitted it, but it is still weaker than just random
 MSmits: WINWINWIN eval doesnt have to be perfect
 MSmits: you can give 50 points for 2 in a row and 100 points for a won board
 MSmits: or something like that
 MSmits: oh i do of course mean unblocked 2
 MSmits: otherwise it is useless
 WINWINWIN: That would make sense, but it seems really hard to get an eval in which ties are uncommon
 MSmits: with enough detail you can avoid tied scores
 MSmits: but then your eval might be slow or wrong
 WINWINWIN: Yes, slow is a major issue for a detailed eval
 WINWINWIN: what depth do you reach?
 MSmits: mcts doesnt have a fixed depth
 WINWINWIN: I meant what depth do you normally reach
 MSmits: i dont know what that means though
 MSmits: mcts will have branches that go 5 deep and branches that go 20
 Uljahn: what depth does you opening book has? :smirk:
 Uljahn: *have
 MSmits: between 3 and 40
 struct: mcts is meant to reach end game
 WINWINWIN: Sorry, I have a very basic understanding of MCTS and minimax
 struct: right?
 MSmits: ah mcts uses statistics to explore good branches deeper than other branches
 Uljahn: with enough rollouts
 tomatoes: minimax has depth. mcts no
 MSmits: my opening book usually doesnt go deeper than 10-12
 struct: But I know what he means
 struct: I saw someone using mcts with fixed depth and eval
 jacek: oO
 Snef: how do you call a mcts with fixed depth and no rollout then&#160;?
 MSmits: but i can make an exception when another player is using one, i will just force down a specific branch and go 40 deep if i want to 
 MSmits: Snef by no rollout you mean no random sim?
 Snef: yea only moves from nodes
 MSmits: it's mostly just a UCB guided search, it's no longer mcts, even though i still refer to it as mcts also
 MSmits: mc stands for monte carlo = random
 MSmits: and there is no random so...
 Snef: the first X moves are chosen randomly before applying ucb :p
 MSmits: i dont do that in any bot
 Snef: oh
 MSmits: either I pick the first one I havent explored or i pick them all
 MSmits: uttt i pick 1, yavalath, oware onitama I pick all
 Snef: yea i do the same i explore unvisited first but i still do random for like first 100/200 iterations
 MSmits: you can backprop the highest score of all chldren or an average, whatever works
 MSmits: Snef maybe it works well I dunno, havent tried that much
 Snef: 100 iterations won't change much anyway
 MSmits: I see only one advantage to that and it might be a big advantage
 MSmits: you do a lot less UCB
 MSmits: but instead of random you might as well just iterate
 MSmits: if you're doing that many
 Snef: sure
 MSmits: btw tomatoes is also using teclles heuristic
 MSmits: it really does improve any bot
 MSmits: teccles that is
 Snef: but for mcts if one brach at depth 5 isn't promising you won't expand it right&#160;?
 jacek: tickles
 Snef: branch*
 MSmits: probably not, depends on exploration parameter
 MSmits: it's all automated anyway
 Snef: yeah.. but i feel you can ignore branch that would be better at a deeper depth
 MSmits: if you think your bot has that problem you need to raise your exploration parameter
 MSmits: it's really just a matter of fitting the parameter
 jacek: and i used to be 5 in uttt&#160;;(
 Snef: i don't have this problem i don't have a real mcts yet :pit's just thoughts
 MSmits: do you have an opening book there too?
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: just center and teccless stuff
 MSmits: ah, good enough really
 MSmits: I think my current leaderboard version has no opening book for player 2
 MSmits: there's no point when everything solves as a loss, you're just making it easier for the other guy
 jacek: you could at least choose furthest loss
 jacek: or one with most visits, hoping he wont notice
 struct: how many rollouts jacek?
 MSmits: kar liso tried that, I have him solved between ply 25 and ply 40 and his bot is deterministic to ply 25 :P
 Uljahn: btw karli so seems to be weak against the side opening
 MSmits: Uljahn probably he is just strong against corner opening because that is where his book is
 jacek: struct about 100k at first turn at 1s
 struct: o.o
 Uljahn: MSmits: yep
 struct: ah ok 
 struct: 1 s
 struct: what about 2nd turn?
 jacek: well 10k
 Uljahn: are your rollouts that heavy?
 MSmits: yeah... that seems really heavy
 MSmits: esp. if you reach that high in the top 10
 jacek: or just slow
 MSmits: that wont cut it
 jacek: well i have 1-ply check for win
 MSmits: you wouldnt even be able to get into legend with that speed
 MSmits: unless you did something else
 jacek: and moves that can win small board are twice as likely chosen as others
 jacek: i dont have any pool node or log table or other fancy optimizators
 jacek: oh sh... which reminded me, i reuse tree in uttt
 jacek: when in oware i dont
 jacek: time for another submit in oware!
 MSmits: hmm
 Astrobytes: I can hardly wait
 MSmits: yeah in uttt it does help to favor some kinds of moves
 MSmits: never got it to work that well though
 jacek: and how many rollouts do you have
 MSmits: 90-130k on turn 2
 MSmits: this is normal for top 10
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: re curse has more
 Astrobytes: (65 trillion on first turn ofc)
 jacek: or maybe we count rollouts differently
 MSmits: maybe, i count it as a selection, expansion and  a single sim
 MSmits: to end of game
 jacek: so do i
 jacek: hmm
 jacek: so you say i could optimize it for 10x speed?
 MSmits: depending on what you do, sure
 MSmits: maybe your random rollout is just very good
 jacek: my board has 10 bitboards
 MSmits: my yavalath random rollout is super slow, but it makes it better
 MSmits: i use 9 x uint16_t and 1x uint32_t
 jacek: why uint32_t
 MSmits: big board needs it
 MSmits: needs 27 bit
 MSmits: or was it 18
 MSmits: anyways doesnt fit in 16
 MSmits: miniboards do
 jacek: actually how do you fit Xs and O in 16 o.O
 Hjax: TIL scipy can run the Hungarian algorithm for me 
 MSmits: 3^9  &lt;  2^16
 jacek: youre using ternany?
 MSmits: for some parts of the bot yes
 MSmits: I use 3 different systems
 jacek: oh my
 MSmits: big board is binary
 Astrobytes: bitboards, titboards and s**tboards
 MSmits: opening book has a crazy coord system
 MSmits: right call that the s**board
 Uljahn: polar?
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 MSmits: It's a coordinate system that takes into account finished boards
 MSmits: all finished boards where X wins have the same code
 MSmits: because it doesnt matter what the board looks like
 Uljahn: ah, sort of a mask
 MSmits: it uses transpositions maximally, only 8692 possible boards out of 9^3 = 19863
 MSmits: 3^9 that is
 MSmits: i only use that to store opening books though
 MSmits: because it's extremely slow
 MSmits: also makes the whole board fit in 128 bit
 Uljahn: and accounts for symmetry i guess
 MSmits: yeah
 Uljahn: that's nice
 MSmits: it also does this:
 MSmits: XX000.XX0
 MSmits: X0000.XX0
 MSmits: board looks different, but has the same future
 struct: How are they equal?
 jacek: why
 MSmits: if X plays, X wins
 MSmits: sorry
 MSmits: draw
 MSmits: if O plays, O wins
 MSmits: so it's the same board
 struct: if X plays in first he wins
 MSmits: this is a miniboard
 MSmits: i should have said that sry
 MSmits: the two miniboards are identical
 struct: ah right
 struct: I see
 MSmits: of course the overall board might be different, but thats encoded in other miniboards
 MSmits: so the fact that there's an extra X in the first doesnt matter for the code for that particular miniboard
 MSmits: there arent that many transpositions like that, but half of the possible boards are ended games and there are only 3 of those really... so plenty of possible  transpositions there
 struct: Do you think opening books will be essential in Othello?
 MSmits: but anyways, this is only useful for opening book, you would have to convert this to ternary or binary every time you needed to make a move
 MSmits: more useful than it is in uttt, it's really not that useful in uttt
 MSmits: in uttt, opening books work well vs opening books, if there was only one guy using them he would barely have any advantage
 MSmits: in yavalath, their use is extreme because games can end so early
 struct: yeah
 struct: On some games it should be hard to implement though, like Yinsh
 struct: Where starting positions are too many
 MSmits: Yes, like Onitama as well
 MSmits: and Bandas
 jacek: you dont have book for onitama? O:
 struct: Also there is no chains in Othello
 MSmits: I dont, how would I use it?
 MSmits: 300k starts
 struct: I thought there was because I didn't read the rules
 MSmits: I couldnt even do the first move for all starts :P
 jacek: 131k possible card placements
 MSmits: two possible players you can be
 MSmits: 1 or 2, that doubles it
 struct: Is it even worth to have opening book for 1 move?
 MSmits: might be yeah
 jacek: toad blacklisted those with 6 plies win
 MSmits: but thats a handful, less than 1%
 MSmits: opening books are useful for moves that seem almost equally good, but one of them is much better in the long term
 MSmits: like in oware, the first move is useless in a book, because apparently, any search will find it
 jacek: 5 is like 4 4 in uttt
 MSmits: yeah
 jacek: and 11 is only possible counter
 MSmits: from what i read on solving awari there are 3 viable counters that lead to a solved draw
 MSmits: but thats a slightly different game so who knows
 jacek: no tric trac yet on othello leaderboard?
 MSmits: maybe he's protesting
 Astrobytes: lol
 Astrobytes: jacek why are you timeout-ing a lot
 jacek: which one
 Astrobytes: Oware
 jacek: which replay
 Astrobytes: I watched quite a few
 MSmits: did you just change your bot to keep the tree jacek?
 MSmits: because thats dangerous in oware
 jacek: yes
 Astrobytes: Did you reset the parent
 jacek: well it works most of the time
 MSmits: you need to do a check at the beginning of your turn if you're nearing the end of your node pool
 MSmits: if you are, reset the tree
 jacek: i dont have node pool, so "shrug:
 MSmits: then check the size of your dynamic node array so you dont hit 750 mb&#160;:)
 struct: also I made first turn 2 sec and 100 ms following
 Astrobytes: Yeah, if you don't reset the parent you'll be keeping the whole thing in memory
 MSmits: happens in Bandas too
 Astrobytes: oh, no node pool?
 Astrobytes: How big is your Oware node pool MSmits?
 MSmits: let me check
 MSmits: const int NODE_MAX = 25000000;
 Astrobytes: Do you use a lot of that?
 MSmits: I think I use a lot when a game is long
 Astrobytes: I've got 10000000 and don't run out
 MSmits: nah, i think i usually use no more than 10 million
 MSmits: but some games are weird
 Astrobytes: I think the highest I saw was 8.5 or 9M
 MSmits: let me check some games
 jacek: too unstable, im gonna turn it off
 jacek: im not sure if its memory issue or bug in code
 Astrobytes: I reuse my tree and it's fine jacek
 Astrobytes: brb, shopping arrived
 MSmits: node index: 16303231
 MSmits: I found this one after a few tries
 MSmits: thats 16 million
 Scarfield: Wow othello already a thing, nice work structo
 MSmits: jacek how big is your node?
 struct: tnaks
 MSmits: and dont make it into a dirty joke :P
 jacek: oh
 MSmits: mine is 24 byte, so effectively 3x uint64_t
 jacek: i know i could get rid of some
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/679cff36-7620-44ef-a0ae-7ffbd9a95b90">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/679cff36-7620-44ef-a0ae-7ffbd9a95b90</a>
 jacek: and children
 MSmits: wait, you have the list of children on the parent node?
 jacek: vector&lt;MoveMcts*&gt; children;
 MSmits: thats painful
 MSmits: your node is 80 byte
 MSmits: mine is 24byte... big difference
 MSmits: and I even save the full boardstate on the node
 jacek: so mine is bigger
 jacek: ah yeah, i dont have bitboard
 MSmits: this might be why you run out of memory, but as you say, could also be other bugs
 MSmits: a trick you can use to shrink nodes is to use integer indices instead of pointers. Might be some small effect on speed, but your node will be 4 byte smaller for every pointer reduced in size
 Scarfield: I started doing no. of children and pointer/index of first child, and have an array of the traversel down the tree, so no need for parent pointers at all&#160;:)
 MSmits: oh yeah, no parent needed either
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2a5dbb01-b3aa-4dd3-a195-e0b75552df6f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2a5dbb01-b3aa-4dd3-a195-e0b75552df6f</a>
 MSmits: my oware node
 struct: does board need to  be 64?
 MSmits: i think i am the only one who uses 64
 MSmits: it's really hard to squeeze it into 64
 MSmits: because you need to use 5 bit per pit
 MSmits: and that holds 31 seeds
 MSmits: so I use the last 4 bit (60-63) for the overflow
 MSmits: I do something similarly crazy in Onitama, where it is actually pretty useless to be that compact
 MSmits: it's just fun for me to squeeze gamestates as small as possible. It would be more useful if I could actually use a transposition table or something, but most games apparently have no use for them&#160;:(
 jacek: do you squeeze your students like that as well?
 MSmits: you mean do I make comments during class that make them feel as small as possible?
 MSmits: not sure, you'll have to ask them&#160;:)
 MSmits: Nagrarok's bot is really amazing
 MSmits: holding up after years
 jacek: struct w00t? white starts?
 struct: its reverse?
 jacek: its othello, not reversi
 jacek: starting position is good, but blacks start
 struct: you right
 struct: Ill fix it
 struct: Ill change black chips owner to 0
 jacek: and no one who has bot there didnt notice? :v
 Snef: i know rules but i don't remember which color start :p
 MSmits: Checkers is funny like that, it has red  pieces but it talks about W and B in input
 darkhorse64: my bot is as usual rand()% actionCount
 MSmits: I start every bot that way to test sim
 MSmits: then you dont have to deal with mcts and all its annoyances
 struct: I think I only needed to change 2 vars
 struct: I think its fixed but ill try to be sure
 darkhorse64: It'll take a few hours to get the engine ready
 Snef: darkhorse64 to sim othello&#160;?
 darkhorse64: The only thing a random bot may not test is when a player has no moves. Sure, I'll write a MCTS for it and bitboard to hell
 MSmits: at least it's easy to bitboard, two 64 bit is about all you can do here
 MSmits: maybe some lookups for checking whether you need to flip
 Scarfield: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 <b>**MSmits dodges</b></p><p><img src="/a/22238461634817" /> Scarfield: xD
 darkhorse64: The only annoying thing is the no moves. It messes all my exploration and backpropagation code
 MSmits: You can just make another node
 MSmits: same state
 struct: Should be fixed
 struct: I dont know why its fixed
 struct: butg it works
 darkhorse64: There are some assumptions here and there that players alternate
 Scarfield: yea black starts now
 MSmits: well yeah, but if you make an extra node when you dont move, you still alternate
 MSmits: it's a no-move node
 MSmits: just save the gamestate on the node, then the game doesnt care about moves
 MSmits: two nodes will just have the same gamestate and thats all
 MSmits: except for who's turn it is obviously
 darkhorse64: A "PASS" node. I have never played Othello. I don't know if it happens a lot. If ti does, it may be worth sparing the node and the traversal
 Snef: darkhorse64 with random bots it nearly never happen, don't know with real bots
 MSmits: You can create the node and then give it a UCT penalty
 MSmits: -0,3 or so
 MSmits: it only starts to be visited when other nodes have sufficient visitcounts
 Scarfield: if neither player can move, the player with the most discs win, so not necessarily a bad thing
 MSmits: and then it will quickly stop after a few visits, because its probably going to be bad
 darkhorse64: Not sure if is bad. I know Othello can drastically change in a few moves. If there is a PASS node, it is single by design
 MSmits: seems this is just something you can experiment with
 MSmits: code the framework, make some parameters and test&#160;:)
 Scarfield: hmm probably true, was just quoting the rules i just read&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: You are absolutely right. The PASS node saves my current code but may impact performance. This is going to be a "squeeze water from stone" multi
 darkhorse64: And then you'll write an opening book and rekt me
 Scarfield: i guess the only way to have neither player being able to move, all the discs will have to be the same color, or no empty cells of course
 struct: no, i havent tested this
 MSmits: darkhorse64 that is also my guess, but I will try to rek people without an opening book first :P
 struct: but I think there are more cases
 struct: and I took that into account in referee
 struct: imagine board was  like this011111111
 MSmits: not sure when though, I will for sure do Othello within a week or two
 struct: and 0 was the only piece that player 0 had
 MSmits: I love this type of game
 struct: he cant move
 struct: neither cant player 1
 MSmits: Btw darkhorse64, I was about to start breakthrough
 MSmits: it's been pushed to nr 2 now :P
 MSmits: structs fault
 eulerscheZahl: the struggle of having too many games
 MSmits: but they're all so much fun&#160;:)
 darkhorse64: I failed badly on my own game. I picked the eval recommanded by Wanderer authors but my bot sucks
 MSmits: EPT?
 MSmits: depth 5 or something?
 jacek: yes, they suck
 jacek: you should refute their paper
 darkhorse64: Yes, I wrote the bot just to test that
 darkhorse64: depth 4
 darkhorse64: I think it's my bot that sucks
 MSmits: if you want to sink more time into it, there's a lot to try
 MSmits: did you try lookups for local board layouts?
 MSmits: also lookups for racing conditions
 darkhorse64: Anyway, I have applied EPT with lot of success on Oware and Onitama. All in all, it has been useful. You mean consider samller areas to find "breakthroughs"&#160;?
 darkhorse64: Or look for patterns that call for attack&#160;?
 MSmits: from what I read it is good to give score to certain configurations of pawns
 MSmits: yes patterns
 RahilMavani: How much programming knowledge should I have for this platform on a scale of 1 to 10&#160;?
 MSmits: also if a pawn is maybe 3 rows before the end, you can lookup whether it is unblockable
 jacek: 2.137
 MSmits: i think it's more like 2.146
 RahilMavani: 2.137&#160;? Woah&#160;!!
 darkhorse64: 3.151592654
 MSmits: the dot is a decimal separator RahilMavani
 darkhorse64: 3.14
 MSmits: its not 2 thousand
 RahilMavani: Are you guys answering my question&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 darkhorse64: joking a bit
 MSmits: but RahilMavani, you just need to understand your language somewhat
 MSmits: loops, functions, classes 
 RahilMavani: Oh Okay
 MSmits: start with easy puzzles
 MSmits: you need to get the hang of the input/output structure
 RahilMavani: Actually I have very basic knowledge of C
 MSmits: then progressively try harder stuff
 MSmits: I'd suggest you learn python 
 RahilMavani: Working on Python and I stopped learning C
 RahilMavani: Learning on SoloLearn
 Scarfield: i can see you have solved the descent, so you should know enough to continue with other puzzles
 Scarfield: also remember to have a look at the "What will i learn" and the external ressourses given for a puzzle before pressing "solve it"&#160;:)
 RahilMavani: I know some loops
 RahilMavani: I solved descent with some help of hints 
 RahilMavani: Also needed some help from solution 
 darkhorse64: From what I have seen, my BT bot suffers from the horizon effect and the large branching factor. When there is a pattern of attack involving sacrifices, it goes unnoticed. Pattern recognition would help a lot. That's beyod my current abilities
 Scarfield: not many puzzles have hints (?) but the external ressources will help you getting an idea of the approach you need to solve a puzzle
 RahilMavani: OKay
 RahilMavani: Now I think I should learn python and then try my hands at this platform.
 JackJohnson: Hi, does "Tower Dereference" only have one league?
 jacek: yes
 RahilMavani: Okay Guys&#160;!! Thanks for  your help
 JackJohnson: oh, was wondering why it is so hard to get promoted, thx&#160;:)
 RahilMavani: I will be back sooner as I complete my python.
 jacek: complete python eh
 RahilMavani:&#160;:) Sooner&#160;!!
 RahilMavani: Is anyone present in sololearn
 RahilMavani:&#160;?
 jacek: im not :v
 RahilMavani: Oh Okay
 jacek: do you have some programming at school?
 RahilMavani: Yes
 RahilMavani: C
 RahilMavani: C  - Programming
 RahilMavani: It was on very basic level
 struct: I can leave the coord system as it is right? 0-7
 jacek: a think ah 1-8 is better
 struct: ok I guess I can do that without breaking the current bots
 struct: I would like a8 though
 jacek: yea
 darkhorse64: +1. Makes it more "professional"
 darkhorse64: Break bots. It's a WIP
 struct: ok
 struct: So output and input will change, sorry
 darkhorse64: No problem. I'll be first for a moment
 Snef: input will change&#160;?
 reCurse: And stdout will need to be base64 encoded
 darkhorse64: x y to chess notation
 jacek: and promotion
 darkhorse64: no leagues, no promotion
 Snef: both char or first char and second int struct
 darkhorse64: a string&#160;?
 struct: it will be a string
 Snef: ok my code is ready tell me when it's live :p
 jacek: you have working bot?
 Snef: what do you mean by working bot&#160;?
 darkhorse64: more than one liner bot 
 jacek: no actions[random]
 Snef: then yes
 Snef: but still not smart at all
 Snef: depth 0 with shitty eval is almost like random
 struct: Should be updated
 jacek: Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
 jacek: when parsing legal actions from referee
 struct: referee error?
 struct: or java?
 struct: because now stub changed
 jacek: maybe i should refresh
 struct: I see the error
 jacek: yeah, refresh done
 Astrobytes: thanks struct
 Astrobytes: (for making that change)
 struct: np
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/1ddLjKh.png">https://i.imgur.com/1ddLjKh.png</a>
 jacek: he says f7 is invalid. yet he sayd f5 as possible action
 jacek: black to move
 Astrobytes: lol, round the wrong way
 struct: shit
 struct: I had
 Snef: yea just  saw a replay with same problem jacek
 struct:  return Character.toString((char)(97 + y)) + "" + (x + 1);
 struct: im dumb
 jacek: struct youre just not accustomed to classes
 struct: Should be fixed
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Snef: bye #1&#160;:(
 struct: So for rest of UI I was thinking on puting players on left
 struct: and the list of all moves on the right
 eulerscheZahl: return Character.toString((char)(97 + y)) + "" + (x + 1);that's a weird coding style
 jacek: like chess PGN?
 Astrobytes: With a toggle to hide the list of moves?
 Astrobytes: I mean, you already have the toggle buttons, don't think we need a hex viewer&#160;;)
 struct: I forgot to remove those buttons :p
 Scarfield: discs as hexes toggle ftw
 Astrobytes: Othellex
 Astrobytes: Othalath
 eulerscheZahl: *Othexo
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://alternatezone.com/electronics/images/hex3101.gif">https://alternatezone.com/electronics/images/hex3101.gif</a>
 struct: Like this jacek
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/IdxaUGS.png">https://i.imgur.com/IdxaUGS.png</a>
 jacek: mhm
 struct: I guess it doesnt have much use
 jacek: you could add how many discs user has
 struct: yeah Ill add that
 MSmits: not sure I dont still have bugs, but with 3 seeds I found at least one 75 depth loop :P
 Astrobytes: lol wut
 MSmits: It solves when it hits a repeated state
 MSmits: apparently its possible to make 3 seeds go around and find 75 different states
 Astrobytes: No I got that part, I was amazed at the 3 seeds and 75 states thing
 MSmits: either that or I am still bugged
 MSmits: 4 seeds is still calculating, depth 36 now
 MSmits: it's basically stuck for a long time until it solves a few states and then it quickly finishes all of them
 MSmits: because once you solve a state, you break other loops
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 MSmits: this reminds me of number shifting :P
 Astrobytes: lol, I never did write a solver for that
 Astrobytes: got to 60 or something by hand
 MSmits: ah ok, yeah theres a hard one around 60
 Astrobytes: Don't fancy doing this by hand
 MSmits: err no, seems hard to play oware 
 MSmits: seeds goin around
 Astrobytes: Ah no, level 65
 Astrobytes: (number shifting that is)
 struct: oh well, I have no ideas for players ui
 struct: Ill just do simple stuff
 Astrobytes: Doesn't need to be all singing all dancing struct, simple, clean and informative
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4209d670-0c00-4905-b21f-7663379b918f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4209d670-0c00-4905-b21f-7663379b918f</a>
 struct: If you could navigate in the viewer by clicking the viewer I would add moves
 struct: moves history*
 MSmits: thats my endgame book up to a part of 4 seeds
 MSmits: of course you need to decode the boardstate, but you can see it doesnt produce weird seedcounts
 MSmits: so theres that
 Astrobytes: nice
 Astrobytes: Did you make a change when you submitted btw?
 MSmits: thats just one of my versions with the sigmoid
 MSmits: still trying to find one thats better than my other version
 Astrobytes: It didn't seem as good as the previous bot
 MSmits: really hard to say, it's in the ballpark
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-oware-abapa/msmits</a>
 MSmits: just weak to recurse
 MSmits: but most of my versions are
 MSmits: i have a rare few with 50% but they are worse vs others
 Astrobytes: Maybe it was just my perception
 Astrobytes: Can't beat either of them without losing hard to others
 MSmits: its just bad statistics with so few games really
 Astrobytes: *either of them well
 MSmits: cant beat both of them and do that no
 MSmits: i have versions that have 50% against everyone
 MSmits: but thats very bad
 Astrobytes: Just a wee bit
 jacek: so you have endgame state and seeds score you can get right?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: if i encounter the same state twice, the branch is terminated with the current score
 jacek: so what if there is 23-24, and endgame says its +2
 MSmits: then p1 wins
 jacek: hmm i was thinking of an example
 MSmits: i ignore the time limit though
 jacek: when you get good seed count, but opponent will win before that
 MSmits: yeah I know it feels intuitive that previous score matters, but it really doesnt
 MSmits: it's always best to get the maximum number of seeds out of the board
 MSmits: just sometimes the max is not enough
 jacek: so you set the game to endgame position and set scores to 0-0?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i hope i have a bug though, either that or these loops are insanely hard to deal with
 MSmits: still on 4 seeds
 MSmits: running it in C# on debug mode, but still
 jacek: how did you enumerate possible positions? sounds like postage stamp problem
 Astrobytes: debug mode wtf
 jacek: or number partition?
 MSmits: i am still debugging
 Astrobytes: lol
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/22b77820-dc55-4646-86e3-be213d8fd41b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/22b77820-dc55-4646-86e3-be213d8fd41b</a>
 MSmits: recursive
 jacek: smitsi number partition
 MSmits: the zero makes sure the previous player has at least one empty pit
 MSmits: otherwise it's an impossible state
 MSmits: ohhh
 MSmits: I goofed there I think
 MSmits: wait no
 MSmits: I confused my ab solver with my state generator, state generator doesnt alternate players
 MSmits: north houses are always player 2 in that case
 jacek: still there cant be 6 zero houses
 MSmits: why not, i can simply call that a loss or win
 MSmits: it happens
 MSmits: but it solves at depth 0
 jacek: exactly
 MSmits: i need all possible states because my 1 seed book depends on 0 seed book and 2 seed depends on 1 seed etc.
 jacek: unless you want just to lookup the table anyway and dont bother
 MSmits: Current seed count: 4Current max depth: 38Current max states: 1365Current solved states: 432
 MSmits: I do it iteratively. Do all states depth 1, then all state depth 2 etc.
 MSmits: it's been stuck at 432 states since depth 20 or something
 MSmits: so these must all have massive loops
 MSmits: and there I was worrying about how to fit 20 seed endgame books in memory :P
 MSmits: still hoping I got bugs though
 jacek: welp <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/642051038257348648/720389289896181802/102564724_2377326155904068_2867471856047122041_n.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/642051038257348648/720389289896181802/102564724_2377326155904068_2867471856047122041_n.png</a>
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: mmh maybe I need to be smarter at my ab pruning
 MSmits: i did -inf +inf, but with a maximum seed of 4 it is actually between -4 and +4
 jacek: technically doesnt matter
 MSmits: well if it can find a branch with +4, wont it keep looking in my case?
 MSmits: it shouldnt, because it is already max
 jacek: +4 is the upper bound, it takes place of +INF
 MSmits: yes but what if beta becomes +4 and alpha is still +inf
 jacek: hmm
 MSmits: maybe I am too hazy on ab pruning though
 jacek: then use meta mcts to solve :v
 MSmits: in the end the mcts is just to guide, you're still doing minimax for the solver part, only without ab
 MSmits: I think it would be several orders of magnitude slower
 jacek: slower than debug?
 MSmits: I mean if you're looking to prove a solved position where guiding isn't   that helpful, then mcts is really silly 
 MSmits: currently trying release. It is a lot faster 
 MSmits: but still having trouble with 4 seeds
 MSmits: starting to see what they mean here:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.slideshare.net/XavierBlanvillain/abstract-oware-solutionxavierblanvillain120226">https://www.slideshare.net/XavierBlanvillain/abstract-oware-solutionxavierblanvillain120226</a>
 jacek: and it only took it few hours on mediocre PC to prove that
 MSmits: I dont get why a 2-seed loop solution would have to be entered manually though
 MSmits: is my method wrong?
 Astrobytes: Try using the results
 MSmits: I assume an infinite loop is a tied score on the second occurrence of the state
 jacek: what happens if 1 seed is on house 0 and the other on house 6?
 jacek: wont it loop?
 MSmits: yes it will
 MSmits: but it will also repeat that state
 MSmits: and my method will end up giving it 0 score
 MSmits: I dont see why that would be wrong
 DragonJ: how do you strip a string in python?
 MSmits: if either player could get a higher score, it would have been free to exit the loop at any point
 MSmits: so it doesnt seem to restrict anything
 Astrobytes: Take it's clothes off DragonJ
 jacek: string.strip()&#160;:?
 WINWINWIN: DragonJ s.strip(char)
 WINWINWIN: Or,
 WINWINWIN: s.replace(char, <i>)</i>
 Astrobytes: I strongly prefer my reply.
 Astrobytes: Yes that seems correct btw MSmits
 MSmits: why would a python be wearing a string anyway
 WINWINWIN:&#160;:)
 struct: Do you want the piece counter numbers to change at frame start
 struct: or at end?
 DragonJ: WINWINWIN thank you
 struct: Should I add a tooltip for skip?
 WINWINWIN: np DragonJ
 struct: isnt called tooltip
 struct: oh it is
 struct: tooltip yeah
 struct: Like the bar things in the viewer
 Astrobytes: As in on the timeline? A tooltip appears when you mouseover the bars in the timeline
 struct: yeah
 struct: So its easier to spot skips
 Astrobytes: could do I guess, best thing is to try it out and see
 jacek: yeah, skip on timeline would be good
 DonnySte: bucchiiiii
 Astrobytes: Are you unwell?
 DragonJ: I stripped the line in python but I still cant split or do any other string operations
 Astrobytes: Why not?
 DragonJ: I found a way around it but some reason I cant access library string
 WINWINWIN: if you strip the line to remove spaces...
 WINWINWIN: How will you split along space?
 Astrobytes: Paste your code and tell us what you want to do
 DragonJ: I made it work but I just wish I didnt have to bypass the issue
 Astrobytes: Are you doing a puzzle? 
 DragonJ: Fantastic Bits
 DragonJ: and am having problems with bits...
 Astrobytes: You know python?
 DragonJ: a bit am learning it
 Astrobytes: Don't start with FB then
 Astrobytes: Any other languages?
 DragonJ: know some java some c++ some javascript a little C
 Astrobytes: Define *some*. Which do you know the best?
 eulerscheZahl: if-else and for loopsenough to put it on your resumé
 Astrobytes: :P
 DragonJ: I probably know python best because I took a college course on it, but I still have a decent understanding of other languages
 Astrobytes: You took a college course on python and never stripped or split strings? Bit odd.
 DragonJ: I did but for some reason the codingame isnt letting me use the string libraries
 Astrobytes: I assure you, everything works on here (well, the odd hiccup)
 Astrobytes: paste the section of code that's giving you trouble and tell us what you wanna do
 DragonJ: I started programming when I was like 6 but I still suck XD
 Astrobytes: You shouldn't need any 'hacks' just to split a string
 eulerscheZahl: at that age i couldn't even read :D
 Astrobytes: I started around 5? But it was just copying my dad's BASIC from his textbook
 eulerscheZahl: these days when software was shared by printing it :D
 Astrobytes: Oh yeahhhh
 Astrobytes: One wrong character...
 DragonJ: I learned programming about the same time as english am still better at programming than english...
 Astrobytes: Your English seems fine
 Astrobytes: But you have a programming issue, so...
 Astrobytes:&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: that means he's really good at coding then
 Astrobytes: lol
 Gedzius: Yo has anyone done the Forest Fire thing
 Gedzius: thanks for the help aprreciated
 Astrobytes: If you have a question, please ask it
 eulerscheZahl: i started ignoring these "who has solve problem X" questions completely. sometimes it's a follow-up question that i'm not in a mood to answer. too much risk :D
 Astrobytes: I bite sometimes, sometimes I'll troll them and sometimes ignore. Totally mood/business dependent
 struct: Hey anyone played Othello?
 Astrobytes: Had to sort out j r k e a bit earlier, kept bugging me for how to win PR2 as he was out of ideas
 eulerscheZahl: ah yeah, ignored that too a few times
 eulerscheZahl: just asked what to do next, as if we knew what his current bot is doing
 Astrobytes: Exactly.
 Astrobytes: I told him there comes a time when you have to think for yourself
 Astrobytes: Haven't heard anything since
 jacek: struct as in real game?
 Astrobytes: Btw eulerscheZahl, I love how that Forest Fire guy waited about 10s after asking before a sarcastic thank you. Kids have no patience these days :P
 eulerscheZahl: and then disappeared completely
 Astrobytes: :D
 Astrobytes: Instant-gratification culture

 Scarfield: ah my bad
 Astrobytes: Silly Duhfield
 Astrobytes: :P
 Scarfield: premium revoked
 struct: i will add a + - pieces change in viewer I guess
 struct: or not
 struct: I don't think I will need to create images to explain this game
 Scarfield: just link to a page with the rules for the game for people not knowing them by heart
 Astrobytes: Yeah, 'detailed rules' or whatever
 Scarfield: would be like explaining chess rules, might as well be a link&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Sorry, meant 'detailed rules'  as a link&#160;;)
 Counterbalance: no rules so my first try is         cout &lt;&lt; actions[rand()&#160;% actions.size()] &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: yeah, statement takes more time than to write the referee
 Counterbalance: yeah
 Counterbalance: you're cranking out games at a high rate
 Scarfield: You lose if:you mess up
 Scarfield: what more does it have to say really :p
 Astrobytes: struct is a Multi Machine Counterbalance
 JBM: just write a good stub and refre to it
 Astrobytes: "Put stones on the board. Win."
 JBM: or at the very least, don't lose
 JBM: that would be Bad
 Scarfield: If you flip a full line of 6 pieces it should say BOOM Tetris
 Astrobytes: "Put stones on the board. Don't lose. Losing is bad." - better?
 Scarfield: missing M'kay
 Astrobytes: Good point.
 Astrobytes: Full statement; "Losing's bad, m'kayyy?"
 Scarfield: a watermark of a sligtly darker green hexagon would be nice&#160;:)
 Scarfield: perfect  Mr. Macstrobytes
 Counterbalance: the rules as I deduce them from a replay are that you must place a stone next to an opponent's stone (or pass if that's impossible) and any opponent stones between that one and another one of your stones in a horizontal/diagonal line gets 'turned'. Is that the whole of it?
 Scarfield: yea
 Counterbalance: cool
 Astrobytes: In a nutshell yeah
 Scarfield: then the player with its pieces having the closests resemblance to a swastika wins of course
 Counterbalance: that goes without saying
 Astrobytes: ffs :P
 Counterbalance: 8x8, nice optim potential
 Astrobytes: Wait til he breaks out the fog of war boards
 Counterbalance: and the 17x33 boards
 jacek: 8.5x8.5
 Scarfield: wrapping borders

 NightScap3: i've tried around too if the testcase wants some delimiter or reacts allergic to space
 NightScap3: s
 NightScap3: but didn't help
 Uljahn: "it didn't even pass the testcases" :upside_down:
 Uljahn: wth, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: and you should not have been a good idea
 Astrobytes: Hover over my avatar NightScap3
 struct: the last space before the \n probably messes it up
 struct: it wants1 2\nnot1 2 \n
 Counterbalance: or maybe for(i in 0..N) loops N+1 times
 struct: LeRenard you have a search yet or random?
 LeRenard: a search. I have retrieve my very old program
 jacek: oh my
 LeRenard: it is one of my first IA bot
 Astrobytes: Setting the bar high before it's even published&#160;;)
 LeRenard: I think 1990
 struct: damn
 Astrobytes: Nice
 struct: your AI is older than me
 Scarfield: but what has it learned in its lifetime :p
 Astrobytes: lol, you young ones struct
 struct: How do you save an AI for 30 years
 struct: damn
 LeRenard: because it is my first big program
 LeRenard: in c/C++
 Astrobytes: I like that you kept that&#160;:)

 Astrobytes: gotta love that massive lose streak at the end of a submit&#160;:/
 Astrobytes: FFS

 Scarfield: so close
 Astrobytes: (Oware for me)
 struct: 1 chip left not bad
 darkhorse64: Wow. Near miss
 Counterbalance: hit?
 darkhorse64: Not yet
 Astrobytes: I'm still coming for you. Soon
 Illedan: Anyone has a link to dbdr's chatlog?
 JBM: anyone know what happens to the rankings and which league the players are in (both in draft and published) when a game is updated?

 struct: last update was on that date&#160;:/
 JBM: is that what we pay for
 struct: nothing happens jbm
 JBM: not sufficient an answer
 struct: you update the game
 JBM: yes...?
 struct: if no boss is added, it doesnt happen anything
 JBM: ok
 JBM: if boss is added?
 struct: Boss will submit
 struct: all players above it after submit is done will get promoted
 JBM: and a new league will come to life
 JBM: if boss is removed?
 struct: Never tried
 struct:&#160;:)
 JBM: so we're not that clearly on "nothing" are we?
 struct: yeah, I might try it though
 Astrobytes: I think toad could clear that up, but ofc, clashing time schedules
 JBM: ofc
 struct: everytime this convo comes up toad is not here
 JBM: if only there was a reference page to turn to
 JBM: it's like, i don't do much tvc development during business hours
 JBM: What A Surprise
 Astrobytes: lol yeah
 Astrobytes: It might be an idea to see if we can come up with a user wiki with info from discord and general tips etc from SDK users
 Astrobytes: Other than the 'official documentation' for now I mean
 Astrobytes: Maybe dbdr would accept that on his wiki page
 struct: imo stuff that is very poorly documented is how to use custom modules
 JBM: it's a wiki
 JBM: it's an implied yes
 Astrobytes: lol, fair point
 Astrobytes: I've made a note of it, I'll float the idea on discord tomorrow if nobody does before me
 Astrobytes: Since most community-game stuff is found there rather than the forum
 JBM: well here we go <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/SDK-related_development">https://cg.spdns.eu/wiki/SDK-related_development</a>
 dbdr: Astrobytes: it's a wiki, I don't need to approve it
 JBM: thank you
 dbdr: if you think you have useful info, just edit
 Astrobytes: Cool ta, yeah JBM pointed that out :D
 JBM: may i contribute a logo for the upper-left corner?
 Astrobytes: Just need to get people to add useful information now
 dbdr: sure JBM. logos/avatars are your forte, right?&#160;;)
 JBM: you bet
 JBM: coming right up
 JBM: what pixel size?
 JBM: not sure we need HD for that
 dbdr: no idea
 dbdr: whatever works&#160;:)
 JBM: ill start in 720x720
 dbdr: :D
 Astrobytes: Alright, posted in the discord
 dbdr: I see you don't believe there is much info to dosplay besides the logo
 JBM: hey somedays i get the feeling i contributed *most* of that wiki
 Astrobytes: :thinking:
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: depends if you count the chat logs&#160;;)
 JBM: those are teamwork
 dbdr: meta
 JBM: how's this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/1372dNa">https://imgur.com/a/1372dNa</a>
 JBM: if you scale down, be sure to use the pixellating kind
 struct: Good
 struct: I would pay you to do logo for Othello
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 JBM: please do
 Astrobytes: Epic JBM. Epic.
 struct: JBM also i fixed the thing you mentioned yesterday

 pluieciel: Hello, I am stucked at The Resistance for several days... is there anyone so kind to help? I'm trying with Clojure, but get 0 for the 4th test.
 pluieciel: Thanks a lot in advance
 JBM: your code is most likely doing too much work
 pluieciel: 0 means too long time?
 JBM: most likely
 JBM: or wrong
 JBM: where do you read that 0?
 pluieciel: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6eb2793f-f8da-4f67-8314-3a5364aaf6ca">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6eb2793f-f8da-4f67-8314-3a5364aaf6ca</a>
 JBM: ok ok plain wrong
 pluieciel: when submit, can pass 2 3 4 6 7
 JBM: if you don't pass 1, you may want to concentrate on that first
 JBM: wait
 JBM: do you even pass the tests?
 pluieciel: test 1 2 3 passed
 struct: I have to start statement
 struct:&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Take a rest man, do it later
 JBM: do it never
 JBM: who needs a statement
 JBM: we can't even have the html rendered properly before submitting
 struct: it can be decent JBM
 struct: you dont know about the statement.html JBM?
 JBM: way more than I'd like
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://localhost:8888/statement.html">http://localhost:8888/statement.html</a>
 JBM: it felt like i bumped into each and every one of its limitations
 JBM: password?
 struct: 123456
 JBM: thx
 JBM: funny how your pwd is all stars like mine
 struct: I think its a chat feature
 JBM: so yeah, i know about statement.hml, and the others htmls too
 JBM: and no, that statement.html is really not "rendered properly"
 struct: yeah its far from perfect
 JBM: see <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://forum.codingame.com/t/misleading-html-in-the-sdk-skeleton/184828/8?u=jbm">https://forum.codingame.com/t/misleading-html-in-the-sdk-skeleton/184828/8?u=jbm</a> for my latest woes
 JBM: it's like it's not even trying
 JBM: statement.html and the IDE are two completely separate rendering pipelines
 JBM: and i'm kind of offended one poses as the other
 JBM: given i'm bumping in the differences one after the other without even trying
 DragonJ: fantastic bits is a bit annoying XD
 Dan4Life: Who knows how to use your own template code cuz the coode at the start is kinda stupid
 Snef: The starter code is used to take input from the game you're playing and showing you how to output
 Snef: of course it won't be smart
 Dan4Life: I mean from Clash of Code
 LelouchVC2: DAMMIT MOM I DONT WANT ANYMORE CORNFLAKES

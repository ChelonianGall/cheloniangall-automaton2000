 <b>**Wontonimo frowns</b></p><p><img src="/a/36757828196866" /> derjack: oh my
 AntiSquid: shit joke
 HunterEhrenfeld: savage
 AntiSquid: the joke was too shit and too random
 AntiSquid: otherwise i wouldn't care
 Wontonimo: and hence required no come back
 AntiSquid: just explaining the kick
 Wontonimo: just a rating :D
 AntiSquid: in case he wonders
 Wontonimo: interesting ... i don't see when someone is kicked
 Wontonimo: is anyone playing 2048&#160;?  I know orangesnowfox was but that fox isn't online
 StarBoyG: lol
 StarBoyG: I was kicked from the world chat interesting :D
 AntiSquid: maybe my joke was shit too? wasn't making fun of him, was a joke based on MK's wording, should have paraphrased it as: "yeah, starg, what's your problem?" would it be obvious then? lol
 AntiSquid: ya because your joke is too low quality starboyg
 StarBoyG: im solving puzzle for 3 hours and then u mock me
 StarBoyG: what would u expect me to say
 AntiSquid: i didn't, see?
 AntiSquid: read above big paragraph
 StarBoyG: okay I did, it wont happen anymore
 Wontonimo: what puzzles u be solving StarBoyG&#160;? (feeble attempt to derail the conv)
 AntiSquid: i mean you could have made a better random joke at least&#160;? 
 StarBoyG: I just checked moderation team list
 StarBoyG: better jokes are for better people :D
 AntiSquid:  /kick
 StarBoyG: hahaha 
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Wontonimo, I played it
 StarBoyG: it doesn't metter which I thought you can ask for help here but u getting mocked 
 StarBoyG: which is absolutely nonsense
 AntiSquid: nobody was mocking you lol
 StarBoyG: meeeh..
 Uljahn: i was real in my mind
 Uljahn: *it
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you do beam search, use snake heuristic, continue your search through the turns 
 StarBoyG: Moderators are volunteers who enjoy CodinGame and its community. While they'll usually be happy to help you with a programming question, they don't have to answer you, so don't ping them for that. Prefer an open question or check the forum.
 UnnamedCodinGamer: this is what I did
 Wontonimo: UnnamedCodinGamer - so i just tried something new that jumped me from 45th to 27th.  I only check 3 of the moves in my search.
 AntiSquid: ok you're a bit paranoid now, honestly. Mad Knight said: what is your problem with the puzzle, and it almost sounded like asking "what's your problem", hence my reply, stop taking shit personally starg
 StarBoyG: I sent him private message
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 UnnamedCodinGamer: three is enough
 Wontonimo: haha ... i just figured that out.  it doubled my score
 UnnamedCodinGamer: the trick for me was to exclude the time factor, as I mentioned
 Wontonimo: the time factor?
 AntiSquid: i still have a basic bot i think for 2048
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you make one continuous search as if you are solving it locally without time constraint
 Wontonimo: ah, yes, continue your search... that would pay big
 UnnamedCodinGamer: locally I get the same results
 UnnamedCodinGamer: then it comes down to evaluation
 Wontonimo: and also switching to c++ and optimizing my code .... that'd all help also :D
 UnnamedCodinGamer: that might help
 UnnamedCodinGamer: but I think the time is enough
 UnnamedCodinGamer: what was it 400 moves?
 Wontonimo: cool cool.  I figured out the snake thing on my own... it's 601 moves
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I saw it in a paper
 Wontonimo: i remembered it from playing
 UnnamedCodinGamer: after eulerscheZahl pointed out that it should work better
 AntiSquid: 601 moves of what&#160;?
 Wontonimo: i got up to 16k once... it took a month part time on my commute.
 Wontonimo: 2048 AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: ya i know which game, but what do you mean by that? it ends in 601 moves&#160;?
 Wontonimo: not moves, but 601 turns.  you can move a lot each turn
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 AntiSquid: ah yeah
 UnnamedCodinGamer: time is not a constraint
 UnnamedCodinGamer: evaluation is
 AntiSquid: and what is the "snake thing"&#160;?
 Wontonimo: start at one corner
 HunterEhrenfeld: i just output random moves in this tic tac toe and im winning most the games lol
 Wontonimo: and evaluate that corner the highest, then move right, then the next row left, then right
 AntiSquid: ah that thing ... exponential series :P better&#160;?
 Wontonimo: 1 2 3 48 7 6 59 10 11 1216 15 14 13
 Wontonimo: ^^ that but as the power
 UnnamedCodinGamer: higher numbers work better I think
 UnnamedCodinGamer: yes
 Wontonimo: I don't do that currently.  Mine is b[x,y] &gt; b[x-1,y] kind of stuff
 Wontonimo: and it stops adding once the constraint doesn't match
 Wontonimo: but it follows the above snake pattern
 UnnamedCodinGamer: mine is just multiplication
 Wontonimo: thanks for the idea about continuous UnnamedCodinGamer.  Don't think i'm going to implement that anytime soon, but if it do I'm sure that'll rocket my score
 UnnamedCodinGamer: you are welcome
 UnnamedCodinGamer: it is relatively easy to implement
 Wontonimo: how about time budget ... i've hear other people say they can only get 35ms per turn ... are you getting more and how much?
 Wontonimo: I'm only getting 39ms, but to be honest I'm not starting my timer right after the first ... OMG
 Wontonimo: I can save so much time 
 Wontonimo: why am I parsing the input after the first input?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: after the end of the turn you collect the common path of all moves and bring the starting game state for the next turn to be the end of the common path
 UnnamedCodinGamer: that way you do not loose information between turns
 UnnamedCodinGamer: time is irrelevant
 derjack: we are eternal
 Wontonimo: i was reading in the state after each turn and reseting my board like a fool.  legacy code from 1 move per turn that never got cleaned up
 UnnamedCodinGamer: Jacek&#160;:)

 Saad-py: do*
 darkhorse64: I have a sweet spot that reaches 20 M but when I go outside my score decreases
 Wontonimo: have a super duper day everyone!  I'm outta here for today
 Saad-py: ok bye
 UnnamedCodinGamer: to you too Wontonimo
 UnnamedCodinGamer: darkhorse64, I have only one parameter beam width 55
 darkhorse64: 200 for me
 UnnamedCodinGamer: It seemed to produce best results between 45 - 65
 UnnamedCodinGamer: if I remember correctly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: It was a while ago 
 darkhorse64: I won a million by decreasing the width. Not too bad
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I get around 20 mill with your setting
 darkhorse64: 24 M with width 64, depth 500 (output first 400 only)
 Tiouz: Are you talking about 2048&#160;?
 darkhorse64: yep
 darkhorse64: 25.6 M
 Tiouz: I am implementing the beam search, but I think I will quickly be stuck in terms of performances in python
 darkhorse64: If you care about performance, do not use Python
 orangesnowfox: Wait, why does smaller beam size help? (my depth: "oh")
 darkhorse64: If I only knew
 Tiouz: Yes, I will translate to C++ afterwards, but I am really bad at C/C++. I don't know the structures enough to code quickly
 UnnamedCodinGamer: orangesnowfox did you see my last message from yesterday?
 darkhorse64: There is a huge gap between 16th and 17th
 Tiouz: For example, what structure do you use to represent the tables&#160;? list of lists or integers&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: Not sure UnnamedCodinGamer
 UnnamedCodinGamer: I explained how best move is picked for the next turn
 orangesnowfox: snake strats?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: as the one that shares the common path
 darkhorse64: tiouz: a 2d array
 orangesnowfox: No, I don't think I saw that
 derjack: no bitboards?
 UnnamedCodinGamer: after the end of the turn you collect the common path of all moves and bring the starting game state for the next turn to be the end of the common paththat way you do not lose information between turnstime is irrelevant
 orangesnowfox: Ah, yes, I have *short circuiting* behavior, but I don't do depth increases till I run out of time... I should probably do that
 darkhorse64: Not enough space for highest value tile
 orangesnowfox: darkhorse64: takes 5 bits to store the value of a tile
 darkhorse64: UnnamedCodinGamer: aha, that a big difference with what I do
 Tiouz: I definitely have a time issue. I can currently only go up to 100 depth max
 UnnamedCodinGamer: darkhorse64, what do you mean?
 MadKnight: hey guys what was that game where u move your pawns up and the opp moves them down, where u have 1 pawn per X and u can't bypass the opponent's pawn&#160;?
 darkhorse64: orangesnowfox: you need more for 65536 tile

 MadKnight: darkhorse64 u recall that game&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: orangesnowfox: no you don't. These are all powers of 2
 orangesnowfox: store the power
 orangesnowfox: err
 orangesnowfox: darkhorse64: see above
 orangesnowfox: (store the power, with an exception for 0, more specifically)
 darkhorse64: I got the idea but 5 x 16 bits is more than 64 bits
 orangesnowfox: wait, where did 64 bits come from?
 darkhorse64: I was assuming that you store the game state on a uint64_t
 orangesnowfox: Nah, I store it on 16 u8s
 orangesnowfox:  ... Although, I could store it on 10... 1 sec, debating cache efficiency vs increased indexing costs...
 orangesnowfox: benchmark needed; too lazy
 darkhorse64: I did not think char vs int really matter. uint64_t would make a real difference but it does not fit
 MateiBalaur: helloo
 MateiBalaur:&#160;:)
 MateiBalaur:&#160;:(
 MateiBalaur: cmf?
 orangesnowfox: darkhorse64: u64 would probably help a lot more... but int vs char means like 4x the space in your game state
 orangesnowfox: In fact, u64 is exactly twice as good as char
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/find-the-winning-strategy">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/find-the-winning-strategy</a>
 MadKnight: found it
 AntiSquid: yes MadKnight
 darkhorse64: I will not start a lengthy discussion but  there is more to bitboarding than just memory optimisation. I am assuming that char vs int will not make a big difference in performance but I have not made benchmarks
 AntiSquid: nevozy what's with the emote spam lol? 
 MadKnight: that's why the ping AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: MateiBalaur english
 AntiSquid: she even direct messaged bloody emotes lol, MadKnight
 UnnamedCodinGamer: darkhorse64, as far as I remember, selecting only the best beam, instead of the common path of all brought me to around 20 million
 orangesnowfox: darkhorse64: true, there's more than just memory. I was just thinking that char vs int would have a difference *because* of memory.
 MadKnight: i have no idea what those emotes were supposed to mean AntiSquid
 MadKnight: darkhorse64 orangesnowfox it's all about processor caching
 darkhorse64: UnnamedCodinGamer: I am somewhat relieved that you achieve the same performance with the same settings :relaxed:
 MadKnight: it saves 64b cache packs
 orangesnowfox: Yes, I know how caching works :p 
 MadKnight: but do u use it to the fullest&#160;?
 orangesnowfox: I make attempts
 UnnamedCodinGamer: if you do not discard beams for the next turn you should score at least as I have
 UnnamedCodinGamer: at the end it becomes evaluation game
 Kitkat260: hi
 darkhorse64: I'll look at implementing the idea

 davilla: oh cool, I have a puzzle I made for a different website, I guess it'd be OK to use it since it's my design
 jacek: :tada:
 davilla: wait, where's the graphics?
 davilla: or does that come later?
 jrke: which graphics you are talking about?
 davilla: when you make a new puzzle
 Unicorn123321: hi
 davilla: none of the ones in community have graphics added yet
 AntiSquid: ya pretty cover image, was expecting something with retro Duke Nukem looks :D
 AntiSquid: snoyes
 AntiSquid: there are some with graphics, but it's optional davilla
 davilla: oh yeah? OK cool, that's what I want to learn
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community</a> check out the other ones then
 snoyes: davilla: you mean like the ones where there's an animation as play progresses?
 davilla: yes, that's a better way of putting it
 snoyes: Those are only for the game types
 AntiSquid: you can make a solo game puzzle
 snoyes: most of the contributed ones are classic puzzles or clash of code, which don't have those turn-based animations
 AntiSquid: see "escape the cat" or "space maze" or even "breach" puzzles
 davilla: oh OK let me check it out
 jrke: i am waiting for 2 approval to make my multi get approved very much interested to see it :grin:

 davilla: haha
 davilla: there's like 12-year olds and tons of guys here
 davilla: good luck
 ill-be-waiting-outside: im 15 and a girl
 deliax: anybody 18+?
 davilla: ooh bot bait, this site is awesome
 ill-be-waiting-outside: does age matter
 AntiSquid: yes
 AntiSquid: always
 Scarfield: does wage matter
 Mircea99: someone pls unplug the ai bots talking ^^
 ill-be-waiting-outside: ik i was just asking
 davilla:  /disable ill-be-waiting
 ill-be-waiting-outside: why me
 AntiSquid: for example biden sniffing little girls is extremely creepy, while him touching a certain ashton carter's wife in public isn't as creepy as touching little girls, see? age matters a lot
 ill-be-waiting-outside: nvm i just won't ask question like that anymore
 ill-be-waiting-outside: just about codea
 AntiSquid: glad to help regardless
 jrke: btw anybody here knows about kociemba algorithm?
 ill-be-waiting-outside: Kociemba's Algorithm was an improvement on Thistlethwaite's algorithm. Korf's Algorithm was developed by Richard Korf in 1997
 jacek: sounds like rubik cube
 ill-be-waiting-outside: it is
 jacek: not that i know anything about it
 davilla: fun reading about God's no.
 ill-be-waiting-outside: i know a little bit about it
 AntiSquid: i need to cook something, name a random recipe or any ingredients @_@
 Jaman: avacado
 derjack: pierogi
 davilla: my go-to recipe is a frying pan and whatever's left over in the fridge
 derjack: light
 ill-be-waiting-outside: ground beef
 AntiSquid: had pierogi in poland btw :P

 AntiSquid: need to shop @_@ Automaton2000 watch over the chat
 Automaton2000: there is a nice one
 ill-be-waiting-outside: Pesto Chicken Bake.
 Unicorn123321: Hi
 davilla: OK so I'm reading about the types of puzzles/games, and there seems to be a pretty big gap in here
 davilla: the way I see it, classic puzzle is very much like solo puzzle, but multiplayer is very different
 davilla: multiplayer games themselves are competitive, and it also divides into levels of progress
 davilla: there's no category that I see for levels of progress in something that isn't competitive multiplayer
 ill-be-waiting-outside: how is everybody today
 Unicorn123321: good..................................
 davilla: I guess I should get on Discord
 Kitkat260: hi
 Scarfield: discord is generally better for more serious questions/debate whatever. You have seen the optimization puzzles i suppose davilla?
 Astrobytes: ill-be-waiting-outside: nothing better to do than repeat the same stuff over and over?Unicorn123321: don't push your luckKitkat260: don't even try itScarfield: Clobberfield
 Astrobytes: davilla: You mean via the quest map or...?
 Unicorn123321: umm....................................
 Kitkat260: don´t try what?
 ill-be-waiting-outside: ok sorry
 davilla: I know there are other types (besides optimization there's clash of code and contests) but I don't think there are any single-player leveled categories, are there?
 derjack: single-player? like optimization?
 Astrobytes: Kitkat260: Your usual repeated "hi" etc etc
 Unicorn123321: ok.... if i did something sorry
 davilla: an example would be the ones that come in a series... you landed, but now do it with less fuel or what have you
 Astrobytes: Unicorn123321: Try to make meaningful conversation
 Scarfield: ClobstroBytes, did you change to MCTS for clobber?
 Astrobytes: Not yet not
 Astrobytes: *no
 derjack: mcts are for noobs who cant eval
 Scarfield: you dont eval, your NN does that :p
 AntiSquid: too many repeated hi, once is enough
 davilla: neural net?
 derjack: eeyup
 davilla: what's mcts then?
 derjack: monte carlo tree search
 davilla: ah
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: What are you using currently?
 AntiSquid: gambling with extra steps
 Scarfield: just basic mcts, needed a break from chess, and this turned out to be simpler than i thought (for once)
 derjack: now do mcts for chess
 davilla: too many rules, simpler games are better&#160;:-P
 davilla: actually I've always wanted to learn go, that'll have to be my next puzzle
 derjack: its puzzle of the week
 Astrobytes: Scarfield: yeah, the sim is ridiculously simple. That's where the simplicity stops :P
 Scarfield: ab is next up for chess, have some bugs that i dont feel like debugging atm
 davilla: oh yeah? oh right, it's a new week, awesome!
 derjack: its atari go
 derjack: each league has its own size, first 9x9, then 13x13 and 19x19. but once you advance you cant go back&#160;:/
 AntiSquid: what do you use currently for your chess bot Scarfield?
 davilla: I don't see a link, other than the quest map I guess
 derjack: its in quest map now. it will be notification in monday evening
 davilla: oh OK nice
 Scarfield: minmax for chess, want to add AB, but since i added castling and enpassant i have bugs
 davilla: thanks for all the info everyone, laters
 AntiSquid: is this your company Scarfield&#160;?  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://mrrobot.fandom.com/wiki/E_Corp">https://mrrobot.fandom.com/wiki/E_Corp</a> 
 AntiSquid: just now noticed 
 LelouchVC2: Antisquid
 LelouchVC2: You remember little old me?
 Scarfield: its not an intended reference, just a dumb joke after CG kept telling me my profile wasnt 100%
 AntiSquid: ah yes the guy with the spicy odd jokes i believe, LelouchVC2
 Astrobytes: Correct.
 AntiSquid: took wrong approach for my secret sauce for vindinium Astropilot, realized after initial part (1/3) was completed i should have built the object structure slightly differently
 AntiSquid: Astrobytes * 
 Astrobytes: Ah, lol. Yeah, try making rough notes first before you dive in - you have time, it's not a contest :P
 AntiSquid: mm but it's a general overall approach
 AntiSquid: so technically i should know better for contest
 AntiSquid: LelouchVC2 came back for clash or are you doing bot programming?
 LelouchVC2: I would drop in from time to time @AntiSquid

 Uljahn: it's more like investing not wasting
 Enwynn: :thumbsup:
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: New to programming this is some hard stuff
 Enwynn: Hard but they are fun to do&#160;:)
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: yes lol if i knew what i was doing, I'm doing this for a class assignment and lost
 jacek: oO
 Enwynn: What class are you taking?
 KiwiTae: TheCaptainKitten_32d8 you made it to lvl 3 :muscle:
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: Its a programming class and my teacher is wanting us to complete dont panick 
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: C
 KiwiTae: TheCaptainKitten_32d8 you can do it 
 KiwiTae: episode 1?
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: yea
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: I need to change this username i swear lmao
 KiwiTae: solve it on paper first, its not hardcore logic that one
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: so i can just create an if statement that says if the clone pos=-1 then block? 
 KiwiTae: pos = -1 means theres no clone alive no? i forgot lol
 Astrobytes: I think it's what direction the clones are moving iirc KiwiTae, hi btw 
 KiwiTae: aaaah oki my bad~ too far away &gt;&lt;
 KiwiTae: Astrobytes&#160;:* hello

 KiwiTae: i beat my 50km time saturday so quite happy :D
 Astrobytes: Oh nice&#160;:) There are lovely places to walk/run in your area (or at least not too far from it)
 Astrobytes: It's not quite jungle but there are hills at least :D
 KiwiTae: yaa theres like a seashore path quite hilly on cliffs 
 KiwiTae: its pretty
 KiwiTae: thanks god they let us go there already cant go dancing or bar&#160;:'(
 Astrobytes: Yeah, well, knowing your area you might run somewhere and discover a wild party in the fields - depending what time you go for a run lol
 KiwiTae: :joy:
 KiwiTae: french people are wild
 Astrobytes: Ohhhh yeah
 Astrobytes: In a good way ofc :P
 AntiSquid: did you have a good look at the assortment of cheese&#160;?
 Astrobytes: No need to. There is raclette. And raclette. And reblochon. And raclette.
 StarBoyG:  If i put three negative nums -5,-6,10 shouldnt this return -11 but it returns 1 as closest  gap between two numbers  for (int i = 0; i &lt; N - 1; i++) {
 StarBoyG: Java is the language..
 StarBoyG: how the fuck
 StarBoyG: oh found it 
 StarBoyG: cheers for AntiSquid
 StarBoyG: my fav moderator 
 MadKnight: lol

 MadKnight: oh no Automaton2000 it's a clash link! run!
 Automaton2000: this is what im doing wrong
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000, running from a clash link isn't wrong
 Automaton2000: but if you already know the answer
 MadKnight: that's the point Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: not the only one i know
 MadKnight: is there other answers Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: is there anything i should know that
 MadKnight: are there*
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u didn't make sense, fix it
 Automaton2000: i guess you are right
 MadKnight: i know Automaton2000t
 Automaton2000: this is why you can have a look at my code and see what happens
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: anyone care to help me with dont panic eps. 1
 MadKnight: what's the problem&#160;?
 MadKnight: i could but i need u to explain your problem exactly
 MadKnight: TheCaptainKitten_32d8
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: okay so its c language
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: I am stuck when it comes to the elevators. I had if and else statements for the first two levels and it worked fine. but when i add more statements to try and beat level three it affects the other levels and it wont work for them either.
 TheCaptainKitten_32d8: I created another array to make it easier on the elevators
 MadKnight: well i gotta see your if()s 
 MadKnight: and your code in general
 Gamak: Hi, I am getting trouble in learning filters in javscript, can someone help?
 MadKnight: just explain what's your trouble exactly
 Gamak: So I have to filter a variable for a particular property using a function
 Gamak: example = var cart=[
 Gamak: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ae0259a-ecee-4cf6-9776-8e2781ddb44b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ae0259a-ecee-4cf6-9776-8e2781ddb44b</a>
 Gamak: extracting from the cart array all the prime items
 Gamak: So how can I do that, if someone can help?
 MadKnight: Gamak u actually got a map
 MadKnight: with key=&gt;value
 MadKnight: and not just an array
 MadKnight: so u gotta look up how to filter a map
 Gamak: I understand but I am not having enough knowledge
 MadKnight: not enough knowledge to look up how to filter a map?
 Gamak: working on it
 Gamak: I am just looking it up 
 MadKnight: wait what criteria do u need to filter by&#160;?
 MadKnight: Gamak
 Gamak: type: prime
 Gamak: example = var cart=[
 MadKnight: then u gotta have an array of carts
 MadKnight: because that's just a single cart 
 MadKnight: with a single type
 Gamak: I do have that
 MadKnight: where's your array of carts&#160;?
 MadKnight: that's what u need to filter
 Gamak: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ab0dd91-a8bb-498d-abb7-c5e70fa20e6b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4ab0dd91-a8bb-498d-abb7-c5e70fa20e6b</a>
 MadKnight: cool
 MadKnight: onlyPrime = carts.filter(cart=&gt;cart["type"]=="prime")
 MadKnight: but then u need to rename your var cart to carts
 MadKnight: because it's carts and not just a cart
 Gamak: done
 Gamak: it failed
 MadKnight: PM

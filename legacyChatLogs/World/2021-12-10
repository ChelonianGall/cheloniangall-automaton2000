 RickyPicky: do u know any websites i can code on
 UZUHAMA: But you get used to it, somehow
 UZUHAMA: Um
 UZUHAMA: Ever tried GitHub?
 RickyPicky: no
 UZUHAMA: I don't really know much about it
 RickyPicky: i thought it was used to steal other peoples code
 UZUHAMA: But I think it's a place for writing code freely and sharing it with others
 RickyPicky: o and dat too
 ZXC01: stealll
 UZUHAMA: I prefer the word"sharing"
 UZUHAMA: lol
 ZXC01: hmm
 RickyPicky: stealing fits
 UZUHAMA: You can only steal if they allow it
 ZXC01: maybe robing 
 UZUHAMA: So that's sharing, practically
 RickyPicky: clashes arent fair
 UZUHAMA: Why?
 RickyPicky: it doesnt make sense
 UZUHAMA: The instructions?
 RickyPicky: yes
 RickyPicky: it jsut lists numbers
 RickyPicky: and expect me to know wut to do
 UZUHAMA: Oh
 RickyPicky: like 001
 RickyPicky: 011
 TheUmgawa: I've learned more about writing code from just reading other people's code than from books on programming. I mean, after learning fundamentals about how loops, conditions, and variables work.
 UZUHAMA: So that's the reverse coding
 ZXC01: no the rules are not fair
 UZUHAMA: TheUmgawa me too
 RickyPicky: the one i hate is 
 RickyPicky: is the shortest code
 ZXC01: some language are faster while others are shorter
 UZUHAMA: Definitely
 UZUHAMA: P Y T H O N
 RickyPicky: the one i had said to write ++
 ZXC01: is LONG
 RickyPicky: ++
 RickyPicky: ++
 RickyPicky: which makes no sense
 ZXC01: c++?
 ZXC01: o
 RickyPicky: the one i know the most
 UZUHAMA: ++ is incrementing by 1
 RickyPicky: but is still dum
 RickyPicky: bruh
 RickyPicky: someone beat it in 38 seconds
 RickyPicky: wut is python 3
 UZUHAMA: They're in another universe
 RickyPicky: 100% score
 Thorcode: what is that
 RickyPicky: idk wut python 3 is
 TheUmgawa: I can't tell if this is a joke or not.
 Thorcode: it is python
 Thorcode: váº» 3
 Thorcode: ver3
 UZUHAMA: Yeah I guess
 ZXC01: hi
 C26_1: Um
 C26_1: Did anyone here know about PHP?
 ZXC01: not me
 C26_1: Ok
 C26_1: The website I encountered has syntax error about PHP 
 C26_1: Go to Codingame Discord to know
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: Can I ask something
 C26_1: What does the keyword "WIP" means in contribution name?
 witschl: work in progress
 E_Mantix: Hello!
 E_Mantix: Could you please take a look on my CoC contribution - <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7759f18c977a21cc12e2b85a8bea60bf3642">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7759f18c977a21cc12e2b85a8bea60bf3642</a>
 E_Mantix: Any commentaries and suggestions are welcome!
 derjack: :upside_down:
 C26_1: Post contribution need a solution likes asking something when you already know the answer but just ask to check the IQ of the overall audiences
 C26_1: My new contribution won't have an answer
 C26_1: Sorry
 Jerrasterix: It will be rejected for sure then :unamused:
 C26_1: yea
 derjack: oO
 C26_1: Wait
 C26_1: Can I ask something
 Uljahn: no
 C26_1: How to making a stub generator input of 2d Array
 Uljahn: read the docs, look through other people's contributions
 C26_1: Very thank you
 Uljahn: if you're lazy, just don't make any, living without making a contribution is perfectly fine
 C26_1: Ah
 C26_1: I know how to make a 2d array
 C26_1: ok
 C26_1: But my contribution will just be a WIP
 E_Mantix: Thanks to -oa-! His suggestion allowed me to improve my contribution(5 messages above&#160;;) ). If anyone has some time and patience/interest - please check it out.
 E_Mantix: @C26_1 - please drop a link - will check it.
 C26_1: Ah
 C26_1: E_Mantix
 C26_1: I haven't done my contribution
 C26_1: The hardest part is to how to describe the statement
 C26_1: Other ones are things that I can handle
 ZXC01: lol
 ZXC01: hey can anyone give some suggestion on my puzzle?
 ZXC01: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7753bfe04219f5d2023bfccf04e824c82bee">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/7753bfe04219f5d2023bfccf04e824c82bee</a>
 E_Mantix: Regarding the statement I can suggest to write it for the first time without any plan, just do it.
 E_Mantix: It will be raw and dirty, but it will be basement and you will see where you can improve.
 E_Mantix: I have rewritten my statement for 12 times before sending xD
 ZXC01:&#160;???
 E_Mantix: It is not for you, but for C26_1
 C26_1: Ah
 C26_1: Thank you
 C26_1: So much
 ZXC01: ok
 E_Mantix: The contribution 'FIRECONTROL' is awesome and you have my upvote in place there.
 ZXC01: thanks!
 derjack: oh my
 ZXC01:&#160;???
 studymachine: how to solve
 Uljahn: yes
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: how to read
 Automaton2000: inoryy how do you check the forum
 Uljahn: there's the forum? :scream_cat:
 BlaiseEbuth: *a
 derjack: inoryy?
 derjack: Automaton2000 when will MSmits return?
 Automaton2000: i really wish i could get the same quetion

 Automaton2000: makes me want to puke

 Illedan: sure
 DialFrost: quick qns can anyone open this?

 NotANick: can i change start template for a question? because that template blowing my mind and i cant solve the problem because of that?
 5DN1L: You can, if you know what you're doing
 Illedan: Yeah, you can do whatever you want. You just can't change the order of the inputs you get
 NotANick: yes i just deletee that array splitting because i dont use that split in my answer
 NotANick: i need question database sorry i dont save that link
 NotANick: for finding question

 NotANick: can anybody help me for right question?
 Urutar: I'll take a look
 NotANick: thanks
 Urutar: Oh, that's a bit hardcoded&#160;:/ I'll try to see if I can solve it
 NotANick: I just brute force that and thanks again 
 Urutar: Mind if I use C# for the code?
 NotANick: you can i can write with c# too
 derjack: i forbid
 derjack: no C# on this site!
 Urutar: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/799ebe5f-b031-419e-bd3a-ae374355e95c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/799ebe5f-b031-419e-bd3a-ae374355e95c</a>
 Urutar: That works
 Urutar: Basically, I try to find the longest commom substring from the ending of the left word which the right word starts with
 Urutar: I hope that's clear
 Uljahn: did you know you can use DM?
 Urutar: Yeah, I realized that aswell just now
 Urutar: Sorry&#160;:/
 Urutar: Well, I'll be off
 BlaiseEbuth: The polite way to say "Shut the f*** up"... :smirk:
 Urutar: Cya all^^
 NotANick: Thank you very much
 Uljahn: also im aware that unfortunately pastebin doesn't work in DM so you have to create a temporary channel to paste a code :unamused:
 NotANick: I can't view pastebins though
 AntiSquid: the pastebin works for me
 NotANick: It gaves me 404
 AntiSquid: in direct message you see the code as it is without pastebin, so that would help you for sure
 NotANick: I know thanks
 Donfreddy: hi

 GamingGnawer: E_Mantix, looks like a good puzzle I made a minor suggestion
 NotANick: make clash questions more clear
 NotANick: pls
 NotANick: for everyone
 NotANick: i spend all time in clash to understand for what the question exactly is
 TryhardestIsBad: ur mom
 5DN1L: NotANick You can rate and comment on any clash of code puzzle after you've finished it. Those puzzles rated unfavourably many times are then disabled.
 jacek: NotANick umm thats the point of the reverse clash :v
 NotANick: I am not struggling with reverse
 NotANick: reverse is easiest for me
 rocap: Some of the categories are so unfair. Like the one for the lowest amount of characters. Of course someone in Python is gonna be able to write shorter code than me in C, they don't even have a main function 
 NotANick: you can learn python
 rocap: I know Python, I just don't like using it
 rocap: I like C
 NotANick: find the way for beating than
 jacek: dont bring knife to a gun fight
 NotANick: lol :D
 NotANick: maybe, but its funny challange for me
 Wontonimo: it's as if it is *challenging* you to stretch your comfort zone with python ...&#160;;)
 Uljahn: some people learn ruby solely for codegolf purposes

 e_fishel: hello âº
 AnubhavSinghChauhan: A lucky number is a 10-based number, which has at least a "6" or an "8" in its digits.
 AnubhavSinghChauhan: Does any have solved his problem
 e_fishel: that seems simple enough
 e_fishel: actually
 e_fishel: very easy with regex
 Westicles: AnubhavSinghChauhan, you might ask on #fr that is more active than here

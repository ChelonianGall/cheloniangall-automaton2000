 Amogh.R: asdsasd please share code
 Mr.Ma: hi, anyone has done the genetic algo, selection part? How to normalize the difference&#160;??:upside_down:
 Mr.Ma: resolved! thanks 
 VizGhar: solved? in 10 minutes? :D u da boss :D
 jacek: good morning
 Mr.Ma: I was stuck by an example in the playground,not a very big problem
 Mr.Ma: btw, the playground is really a good place :100:
 jrke: yahoo fixed my endgame solver now it needs optimization
 jacek: yahoo still exists? :thinking:
 Mr.Ma: Mario's favorite search engine
 Mr.Ma: Yahoo!
 jrke: yahoo means hurray in that sentence
 Westicles: Is there a list of python libraries support on CG?  Was looking for shapely but I seems not supported
 Uljahn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/faq">https://www.codingame.com/faq</a>
 Uljahn: numpy, scipy, pandas
 Westicles: hmm, thanks.  there must be some language here that can calculate intersecting polygons without doing it from scratch...
 Westicles: for Encounter Surface
 mzbear: you want the easy way out?&#160;:)
 Westicles: I think it would be more fun to figure out how to link to boost from bash then mucking around with boring polygons
 mzbear: the polygons seem to be quite small, and the coordinates are integer only with very small values, so surely you could use some ridiculous approach to this that doesn't require generating the actual intersection geometry
 mzbear: omg wtf, the polygons are also guaranteed to be convex
 mzbear: this has been made unnecessarily simple
 mzbear: ohhh, "The vertices of the polygons are not necessarily given in the order" ... i see, it does have a fancy side to it
 mzbear: i'm so going to solve this in a wrong way ;D
 Westicles: I found libboost on the file system, should be some way to link it.  That would actually come in handy lots of places
 mzbear: :D
 Westicles: Can you use Sutherland-Hodgman?
 mzbear: there's absolutely no need to since it wants rounded up integer value as a result

 Sniperboy0301: hello
 LightFury001: hello
 LightFury001: how are you
 jacek: good morning
 Passifi: When debugging I often end up desperatly trying to fix the part of my code that isn't broke just to end up realizing the problem lay elsewhere. I wonder is that a common coder thing or is that just me&#160;?
 mzbear: how would you know the correct part of the code was truly right without debugging it first?
 mzbear: i am most distressed when the code works without having to debug it.  since it hasn't been debugged, i have no confidence in it ;D
 Passifi: I never have confidence in it there is always a scenario I haven't thought of waiting, lurching in the darkness... ready to strike 
 Passifi: but I see your point&#160;:)
 mzbear: Westicles, i solved the Encounter Surface without doing a single intersection calculation of any kind ;D
 Westicles: Nice job.  I'll give you an upvote when I get there&#160;:)
 mzbear: you might not upvote it after you see it ;D

 Westicles: aha!
 jacek: robo :E
 RoboStac: all my testing shows 50% vs you so I just need to find the version that doesn't lose to someone else randomly&#160;:)
 jacek: and rarely i get time exceed&#160;:/
 RoboStac: interestingly this version appears to be almost all white wins between us, the other two were almost all black. 
 RoboStac: just need to find a way to fit 2 copies of my nn data in and choose based on player :o
 jacek: my bot likes white too
 jacek: ai is racist
 jacek: phew
 MSmits: yeah, breakthrough does seem like a game where p1 would have massive advantage if really good bots are playing
 MSmits: with weak bots it shouldnt matter as both sides would have made so many mistakes, the advantage disappears
 jacek: friday, friday ~
 YoungMoker1: i cant figure out what im doing wrong
 YoungMoker1: can someone help me&#160;?
 jacek: hmm?
 jacek: how may we help you, Sir/Madam
 YoungMoker1: uhm do you have discord
 YoungMoker1: i can send a screenshot
 pb4: RoboStac&#160;: how much do you compress your weights currently&#160;?
 jacek: there is join us on discord above
 pb4: oh he was here a long time ago...
 jacek: but still online
 RoboStac: currently they're just float16's with base65536 
 pb4: so 16 bits per character
 pb4: And you can't have two NNs in your code&#160;???
 pb4: How big are them&#160;?!
 pb4: they*
 pb4: Is the full code compiled &amp; encoded or just the weights&#160;?
 RoboStac: just weights
 RoboStac: about 47k on the current bt submit
 RoboStac: base65536 isn't perfect at getting 2 bytes into 1 character either, so 47k of weights ends up being around 60-70k of CG codespace
 pb4: I don't get it, doens't base65536 mean that exactly one unicode character can be used to store exactly 16 bits&#160;?
 jacek: some unicode characters count as 2
 RoboStac: some unicode characters are more than 2 bytes and count as 2 CG chars
 jacek: i think base50000 something could do exactly 1 per 1
 pb4: oh
 RoboStac: yeah, but then you need multiple chars per weight
 RoboStac: so you still have the same problem
 jacek: you cant slightly lower your resolution?
 RoboStac: probably
 RoboStac: but then I'd need to handle that rather than using a type that already exists and I'm lazy
 pb4: :D
 jacek: enjoy your 2nd place then
 RoboStac:&#160;:(
 pb4: It's not *that* difficult to lower resolution
 pb4: but you can't lower it that much
 RoboStac: don't make me spam submits till the ranking admits we're actually equal
 pb4: Which game is it&#160;?
 RoboStac: breakthrough
 jacek: its snowy :3
 reCurse: My training got strange, P2 has slight advantage now
 jacek: and how long are games now
 reCurse: Still 150 lol
 MitchellHarrison: &lt;3
 reCurse: It went down briefly for an hour or two
 reCurse: Then went back up
 jacek: well, most games end with &lt;80, i choose shortest wins, if i wanted to play around i could add 20 moves to them
 reCurse: I need to write a CG version to examine if it's legit
 jacek: you didnt check this first?
 jacek: or youre doing this muzero thing :v
 reCurse: Chicken and egg
 reCurse: Yeah lowest it's been is 130 per game
 reCurse: Then went back to 150 slowly
 RoboStac: yeah, that doesn't sound right
 reCurse:&#160;:'(
 JamesPacileo: is this chat related to the racing game?
 reCurse: Related to CG
 jacek: coders strike back?
 JamesPacileo: oh I see the whole site
 JamesPacileo: oh, i see ok thanks!
 JamesPacileo: how many levels are there?
 eulerscheZahl: user levels? no upper limit
 JamesPacileo: i'm working through coders strikes back, wondering how many steps there are in the excercise
 eulerscheZahl: so leagues?
 JamesPacileo: ahhh that must be it, yes
 eulerscheZahl: wood3,2,1bronze, silver, gold, legend
 JamesPacileo: thanks, how many leagues are there?
 struct: wood-&gt;bronze-&gt;silver-&gt;gold-&gt;legend-&gt;nn
 JamesPacileo: ah I see thanks!
 eulerscheZahl: right, the NN league :D
 JamesPacileo: ok I'm at bronze now, let's see how far I get haha
 struct: On gold you get 2 pods per player
 JamesPacileo: yikes haha sounds fun
 JamesPacileo: to move up a league is first place required?
 struct: you need to be above the boss
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/coders-strike-back/leaderboard</a>you can view the last battles of top players if you want
 JamesPacileo: wow thanks for the link, that looks fun
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming</a>there are also lots of other games on this platform
 JamesPacileo: does the NN gets trained by performing battles with other players?
 eulerscheZahl: trained offline, then uploaded with fixed weights
 eulerscheZahl: CG doesn't allow to take any data from one match to another
 JamesPacileo: ah cool! that's probably better as algos running on the platform for longer could have an unfair advantage
 JamesPacileo: moving into silver now wee
 jacek: :tada:
 cegprakash: a wild cegprakash appears
 JamesPacileo: *throws pokeball*
 JamesPacileo: can I pick a random player to play against offline instead of boss?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 eulerscheZahl: delete the boss, then pick anyone
 eulerscheZahl: note: only from your league and belowand only the first 1000 are shown in the options
 eulerscheZahl: usually not a big deal. but CSB is huge as it's the tutorial
 struct: I think they should update the 1000 thing, for the 95%
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, write it on #bugs
 eulerscheZahl: proper filter would do wonders (search again when applied, not filtering the 1000 only)
 JamesPacileo: Promotion to Silver League in&#160;:00H 26MN 01SC
 JamesPacileo: why is it not immediate? :D
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, that's annoying
 eulerscheZahl: we all hate it
 eulerscheZahl: for legend it can take 6h if you catch a bad moment
 eulerscheZahl: for contests promotion is instant
 JamesPacileo: ah haha ok, was excited to work on the next part of the puzzle&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: CG reasoning: we want to force you to take a break
 eulerscheZahl: i'm not even kidding&#160;:(
 JamesPacileo: I assume I could select Boss 5 while I wait?
 eulerscheZahl: rules will change again
 BlaiseEbuth: They take care of the 5%.
 eulerscheZahl: do you have collisions yet?
 RoboStac: you can't select a boss from a higher league
 JamesPacileo: ohhh&#160;:(
 RoboStac: yeah - it's shield or boost in silver
 eulerscheZahl: i think SHIELD is new in silver
 RoboStac: (whichever he doesn't have yet)
 eulerscheZahl: You may activate a pod's shields with the SHIELD command instead of accelerating. This will give the pod much more weight if it collides with another. However, the pod will not be able to accelerate for the next 3 turns.
 eulerscheZahl: A shield multiplies the Pod mass by 10.
 JamesPacileo: thank you!
 JamesPacileo: wait so the SHIELD can be used as a break?
 RoboStac: no
 RoboStac: well, it's the same as outputting 0 thrust
 eulerscheZahl: it's meant to slam into your opponent and avoid getting pushed away
 JamesPacileo: thrust in before other player then shield when near the checkpoint?
 eulerscheZahl: shield when enemy gets mad
 Astrobytes: try it and see
 eulerscheZahl: he can't try it
 eulerscheZahl: 25min till promotion
 eulerscheZahl: because CSB
 Astrobytes: ooh, that
 JamesPacileo: hahaha
 JamesPacileo: what league are you guys at? NN?
 eulerscheZahl: legend
 darkhorse64: You have no break. But you output 0 thrust, friction will stop your pod. Every turn, your current speed is multiplied by 0.85
 darkhorse64: *but if*
 eulerscheZahl: but legend is huge. could be split into 3 or 4 leagues
 Astrobytes: ^
 RoboStac: there isn't really a NN league, legend is max (but the top 5 or so players who use NN are so far ahead of everyone else it's a joke that they have a separate league)
 JamesPacileo: ohmeaning there's promotions within the legend league?
 reCurse: 5? Thought there were 4
 eulerscheZahl: "5 or so"
 reCurse: Wondered if there was a new challenger
 Astrobytes: JamesPacilio: No, but it theoretically could be divided that way
 JamesPacileo: oh wow I see, does the NN need to be trained in the browser?
 RoboStac: yeah, was just a rough number as I can't remember exactly
 struct: no, its trained offline
 eulerscheZahl: you start be reimplementing the whole game engine
 JamesPacileo: as in I'll have tools to run the simulations on my pc?
 MitchellHarrison: Hello felloww humans!
 reCurse: You're trying to run before learning how to crawl, imo
 eulerscheZahl: there is no public framework. users rebuilt a lot
 BlaiseEbuth:  Who are you calling human&#160;? :rage:
 JamesPacileo: woah that sounds like a lot of work&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: months if not more
 eulerscheZahl: and then you realize that one pod can turn in one direction because you have a bug *looking up*
 jacek: and then site works slow because its league recalc
 eulerscheZahl: i'd really like to see their internal bug tracker
 eulerscheZahl: if they add stuff like that and ignore it or not even insert it there
 jacek: known issue / wontfix
 BlaiseEbuth: Is there an internal bug tracker&#160;? :3
 darkhorse64: technical debt with hundreds of entries
 [CG]Thibaud: it's on Trello :grimacing:
 eulerscheZahl: as you are here Thibaud, I have a feature request:
 eulerscheZahl: the SDK has a test.html page to view the game locally
 eulerscheZahl: it also has statement.html and stub.html but most users don't know them
 eulerscheZahl: request: add 2 buttons for them on test.html
 eulerscheZahl: just 2 links
 [CG]Thibaud: :eyes:
 mzbear: I also have a feature request: save button in the IDE. Currently, if I need to close the tab with unfinished code in it, i need to run a test that I know will fail, just to make the code save.
 mzbear: when i was solving my first puzzles on this site, i actually ran into a situation where my browser was eating 10G RAM but I couldn't restart it because I didn't know how to save the unfinished work ;D
 eulerscheZahl: 10GB :o
 eulerscheZahl: which puzzle?
 mzbear: i just have lots of tabs open, it wasn't CG site responsible for all of it
 eulerscheZahl: i once had to hold a presentation about gametheory at university
 eulerscheZahl: minimax among others
 eulerscheZahl: opened Tron before
 eulerscheZahl: when it was my turn, i opened the laptop. and it was completely frozen
 eulerscheZahl: had to reboot while everyone was waiting :D
 reCurse: This is why you record videos for presentations :p
 JBM: TBF a recorded video can find its own way to fail too
 [CG]Thibaud: might be quicker to do a PR on the repo eulerscheZahl
 JBM: countless ways for management to discover how it's not that simple to broadcast video
 reCurse: I didn't pretend it was perfect...
 reCurse: But can we at least agree there are less degrees of possible failures that way?
 JBM: you don't have to dig for disagreement in everything i say
 reCurse: lol
 reCurse: It's funny because that's what you're doing, so I don't get it
 reCurse: Anyway...
 JBM: "alternate POV"
 JBM: not the same thing
 JBM: in this case, more like "additional" than "alternate"
 JBM: fwiw I'm in the "record it" camp
 JBM: if only as a failsafe
 reCurse: 3 pawns stuck at the 7th row... oh no...
 reCurse: Should have written that visualizer
 reCurse: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 JamesPacileo: players in a league are all the players that can't beat the boss?
 JBM: in a nutshell, yes
 reCurse: And/or the others near the boss
 reCurse: Yep, winning is losing
 JamesPacileo: thanks! what does it mean if someone is rank 1, but hasn't moved up to the next league?
 JBM: “tough luck”
 RoboStac: the boss doesn't have a rank so you can be rank 1 but below the boss 
 reCurse: Didn't it use to? Or I have bad memory
 RoboStac: yeah, it changed last year I think
 JamesPacileo: so I can also be rank XXX, but beat the boss?
 reCurse: Very unlikely but in theory yes
 JBM: some multis are more prone to it than others
 JamesPacileo: rank I assume means highest W/L ratio in the league
 RoboStac: it's trueskill based rather than pure w/l ratio
 JBM: or overspecialized AIs
 reCurse: In theory
 JamesPacileo: trueskill? as in a match outputs a performance number rather than W/L?
 reCurse: No, that's what's used to calibrate the score out of W/L
 reCurse: Unfortunately may I add...
 reCurse: There's much better and stable ranking for bot competitions using win ratios, but unfortunately never gonna happen
 reCurse: Though I guess in theory you could have a third party scan the new games and build a leaderboard that way
 reCurse: Hmm...
 reCurse: I have too many ideas and too little time
 JBM: kind of like pb4 already does?
 reCurse: Yeah
 reCurse: Well there's more theory to be found behind it
 reCurse: But the underlying idea is the same
 reCurse: That way you don't have unstability caused by whoever submits last
 reCurse: The rerun has already been sort of proven to work out
 reCurse: But for multis...
 reCurse: Different story
 reCurse: Online algos like TrueSkill have as purpose to process millions if not billions of matches
 reCurse: So processing power kept at minimum is vital
 reCurse: But if you don't have nearly as much volume... there's so much better
 reCurse: Turns out your training goes 3x faster when your bot tries to win
 reCurse: Surprising I know
 reCurse: Move fast and break your neck as the saying goes
 reCurse: I killed the chat&#160;:'(
 jacek: hm? so your bot didnt try to win before?
 jacek: no wonder those games were that long
 jacek: he was afraid to end it
 reCurse: Yeah a really stupid error in backprop, for whatever reason I decided to treat the winning state differently than other games
 reCurse: Average is 67 currently
 reCurse: Sounds more like it
 jacek: :tada:
 Wontonimo: @JBM - I've found that if I code something to specifically beat the boss, but it is foiled by someone in a lower rank, my bot will never get to the boss and instead will get stuck in a rank below the player that beat me.  lesson here is - don't code to beat the boss, code to be better than everyone in the league
 reCurse: Words of wisdom
 jacek: but also you push that player up
 Wontonimo: oh!  Interesting
 jacek: if youre better than boss and keep pushing people up, youll be pushed eventually
 k4ng0u: ^ just push that player out of your league :D
 reCurse: That seems a rather contrived way to do it :P
 Wontonimo: conceptually, it if is Rock Paper Scissors, then it is possible that the bot I push up will never be able to beat the boss.  If the Boss is Paper, my enemy is Rock, and I am scissors, pushing them up will never get to beat boss
 reCurse: But the player you're pushing never plays against the boss
 reCurse: Yay rankings
 reCurse: I guess that's an argument in favor of 3p and 4p games :P
 Wontonimo: right ... what?  so, they could be pushed pass the boss?
 reCurse: Yes
 Wontonimo: weird
 reCurse: Matches only happen for those who submit and those they play against
 reCurse: Which is exactly why rankings are so biased like I mentioned
 reCurse: In practice it doesn't matter too much outside the top something in legend
 reCurse: Eh... I dunno actually.
 struct: I was pushed from 40th in gold to legend
 struct: in 1 day
 Wontonimo: without resubmit?  okay then, there's the answer.
 reCurse: With winratio pairings it would be probably much harder if not impossible
 AI_says_hi: the leagues are what euler just typed&#160;:)
 AI_says_hi: oops
 reCurse: That being said I don't think it's too viable a strategy :P
 reCurse: Better to just improve y our bot
 AI_says_hi: scusa
 Wontonimo: @reCurse, what match are you working on where you are working on the backprop and your code wasn't trying to win?
 reCurse: What game you mean? Breakthrough
 Wontonimo: Cool.  Thanks.
 reCurse: The worst is there was a very strong suspicion something was wrong but I didn't bother checking, was busy with other stuff
 reCurse: I'm not smart
 reCurse: Walk time, bbl
 AI_says_hi: "I'm not smart" that's my problem as well :p

 samples32: Why won’t thor go south wesst 
 struct: 2 mistakes
 Wontonimo: Anyone have $0.02 on ways they've found to improve upon MCTS?  There was a paper I read about first initializing the expanded nodes score with a heuristic value and then adding a rollout.  I found that it seriously improved the cost effectiveness when the heuristic was sane (like piece count or rank of leading piece)
 struct: 1 you are printing more than 1 time in that while loop
 struct: and 2nd you are not updating the thor position
 samples32: Thanks for the tips
 jacek: you mean in games general?
 Wontonimo: yeah, in general... or if you only have a specific example that would be fantastic also.
 Wontonimo: (but i doubt *you* only have 1 specific example)
 jacek: MCTS Solver (always), check for win/lose in every 1 ply in selection/playout (sometimes, must-have for yavalath, useless for othello), fine-tuning C constant
 samples32: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c2f513fd-2041-4e42-86d8-58977d8eae83">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/c2f513fd-2041-4e42-86d8-58977d8eae83</a>
 Wontonimo: it looks like you are still printing directions twice
 struct: That code is the same
 jacek: for game-specific if heuristic is cheap you can incorporate it into rollout i.e. taking corners move are twice as likely to be picked than any other moves
 Wontonimo: (how do you do the paste bin?)
 samples32: I keep trying different than signs
 samples32: Just paste somthing in
 jacek: and if you have more heuristic, then yeah, for selection part you can either initialize score and visits, or use progressive bias to select heuristic nodes first
 jacek: samples32 you still can print twice
 k4ng0u: Wontonimo just write a long message and it will be displayed as a pastebin link
 samples32: What do you mean
 jacek: what error do you get
 samples32: Warning: your code did not read all available input before printing an instruction, your outputs will not be synchronized with the game's turns and unexpected behaviour may occur.
 Wontonimo: there was a paper I read about mixing MCTS with minimax, whereby 90% (or some other configurable amount) of the time a rollout is a random play as usual.  10% of the time the rollout is replaced with minimax (limited depth).  The results in the paper showed that it was superior to MCTS for technical games like chess.  I haven't tried that.
 Wontonimo: "A Rollout-Based Search Algorithm Unifying MCTS and Alpha-Beta" by Hendrik Baier
 jacek: samples32 add else before every if except first

 Wontonimo: ^^ maybe that will work for you
 samples32: He was going in the right direction 
 Wontonimo: if you look at the changes, you'll notice that there were three if blocks in your code that have been replaced with just 1 if block.  
 samples32: Oh so thats how it’s diffrent
 Wontonimo: each of your 3 if blocks will print to console.
 Wontonimo: so every turn you were printing 3 directions.
 samples32: is that expose to happen. Sorry I’m new to the game
 Wontonimo: is what supposed to happen?
 samples32: It print three directions.
 jacek: one direction per turn
 samples32: But wontonimo’s code prints three directions per turn.
 samples32: Ohh sorry forget the coment above
 jacek:&#160;:?
 samples32: I just realized that I miss interpreted what wontonime said  
 jacek: oh my

 samples32: Sorry

 samples32: join the next public clash
 JamesPacileo: 400 units
 samples32: What do you mean?
 JamesPacileo: wish i could write the code in an ide in multiple files&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: you can. offline. and with a script to bundle them
 eulerscheZahl: that's what most of the more involved players do
 JamesPacileo: nice, would the code get pushed the web app and played as well?

 eulerscheZahl: possible. short statement in low leagues not to scare off the 95%
 Nerchio: yeah for people who know what they want its limiting :D
 samples32: Is that better?
 reCurse: We've been complaining about that for ages :P
 eulerscheZahl: not better samples32.how should that collaborative coding that you suggest look like?
 eulerscheZahl: do you just want "team" or do you have a more concrete idea in mind?
 samples32: just want “team”
 samples32: maybe live coding together

 eulerscheZahl: yes reCurse
 jgers32: LMAO reCurse
 Wontonimo: drinking game
 VizGhar: :D
 Edi007: Should I write a code for each case, or should I write a code that should pass all test cases?
 jacek: where is "don't ask a question. provide wrong answer"?
 jacek: Edi007 all cases
 Wontonimo: @Edi007 - you can do the practice challenges any time you like
 jacek: validators are different than test cases
 VizGhar: Edi007 programming is mostly about finding universal solution.
 Astrobytes: jacek: it's in the How To Answer A Question guide.
 eulerscheZahl: i've read about a study: ask a question and measure the time it takes to get a helpful answer.then do the same again but quickly reply (with other account) and give wrong answer
 eulerscheZahl: turned out users like to correct others. so in the latter case it was faster
 Edi007: So basically I should write the code that tests the first case and then the second case...
 reCurse: That's as old as the internet
 reCurse: It's called the art of trolling
 jacek: godwin's law
 Astrobytes: Hence jacek's presence
 Wontonimo: i feel like a noob cuz i never heard that trick before
 eulerscheZahl: Edi007 you should write code that works for all possible inputs
 jacek: even halting problem?
 Astrobytes: You always say Godwin's Law jacek just to see if it actually happens
 eulerscheZahl: don'tif (input == 1) print 2if (input == 2) print 4
 eulerscheZahl: doprint(2*input)
 reCurse: But what if 3 prints 8
 reCurse: Checkmate
 VizGhar: (carefully there eulerscheZahl he will copy-paste)
 Wontonimo: Edi007 - what eulerscheZahl said, but i'll add my pragmatic approach.  If i'm in a rush (like clash of code) I'll first write code that solves most of the test cases without over thinking it.
 eulerscheZahl: then we have to reconsider the hypothesis
 Wontonimo: but indeed I'm still targeting the general case
 reCurse: Looks like P2 has a massive advantage in bt
 eulerscheZahl: i didn't expect that
 reCurse: Disclaimer: I have a prior of making stupid bugs
 jacek: huh
 eulerscheZahl: I know. the attempt to win the game
 eulerscheZahl: or lack of
 reCurse: BT is solved as p2 wins for smaller sizes
 reCurse: So it wouldn't be out of the blue
 jacek: my bot gets like 70% wins as p1 against itself
 reCurse: Uh oh
 eulerscheZahl: then your bot is buggy?
 reCurse: Groundhog day?
 eulerscheZahl: broken as p2 or cheating as p1
 Astrobytes: sounds like another backprop issue
 jacek: dont take my word for it
 jacek: maybe i shall stand corrected
 reCurse: By the way the bug was funnier than that
 Wontonimo: according to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_(board_game)</a> , in smaller games of 6x5, 5x5, 3x5, the second player has been proven to be able to always win.
 reCurse: It was wrong when searching but not when learning
 reCurse: So it would play really good moves but refuse to finish
 Astrobytes: heh heh, awesome
 jacek: maybe he didnt want to prematurely finish
 reCurse: Make the pleasure last
 Astrobytes: lol, AlphaHero
 Wontonimo: maybe unlock a badge for that TNG-Data badge
 Wontonimo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIRT6xRQkf8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIRT6xRQkf8</a>
 Astrobytes: nice Wontonimo
 eulerscheZahl: so your bot was like that soccer player who stops the ball on the goal line and then uses the head to score?
 reCurse: Only scores when there's no other option
 reCurse: So lots of pawns waiting on 7th row
 eulerscheZahl: :D
 Astrobytes: Winsafe failing?
 reCurse: At least the stories are funnier than uttt
 reCurse: There's nothing funny about uttt, only sadness
 Astrobytes: Ultimately Miserable Endeavour. We should petition for the name change.
 Nerchio: i didn't advance from wood3 in code royale :joy:
 VizGhar: I believe AutomatonNN found it funny
 AutomatonNN: eulerscheZahl is there a way to see the code in the chat or a big array in java on this site
 VizGhar: hmm not very wise bot I must say
 Nerchio: well he sure knows who to ask though
 Nerchio: eulerscheZahl knows the answer to everything
 jacek: but does he know about big array in java?
 cbg: Hey, I'm a beginner programmer with python, should I prioritize readability or lines of code when doing a practice exercise?? 
 reCurse: Prioritize solving the problem correctly
 Voltag3z: Hi people
 Voltag3z: Cofee?
 reCurse: Sure
 cbg: yeah, I know, the thing is I sometimes check the most popular solution in an exercise and is just a massive print
 Voltag3z: :coffee:
 reCurse: Thanks!
 Voltag3z: have a nice day men 
 Uljahn: cbg: it's easier to impress people with a short solution than with a readable one
 smokeweederryday: code should never be readable, otherwise you wil get fired
 Uljahn: you could fail a code review and get fired as well i guess
 smokeweederryday: when the codebase is big enough and impossible to decypher your employers need you
 Uljahn: just learn cobol ezpz
 BeastMan: Hello
 jake1: never write compact unless for competitions
 jake1: or assembly
 jake1: or having a team of geniuses 
 Astrobytes: If you're only doing puzzles/practising then do whatever you want.
 Astrobytes: Otherwise, be prepared to find another job.
 Astrobytes: Or become a professional golfer...
 Uljahn: "import this" in python says readability matters, so many popular solutions are against the Zen of python, just downvote and move along :smiley:
 cbg: thanks for the responses :smile:
 Astrobytes: Seriously though, like re Curse said - focus on solving the problem first, keep it as readable as you need it. You can make it fancy after that if you feel the need.
 struct: Was reading my java code from when I joined CG
 struct: cant understand anything I wrote
 Astrobytes: That's generally the case with old CG code&#160;;)
 dbf: I stop to understand it sometimes even during the contest
 JudgeAL: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/61029c19e127354559b93908d1dcfedac3ff">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/61029c19e127354559b93908d1dcfedac3ff</a>
 JudgeAL: I have changed test cases to be kinda like hints
 JudgeAL: since last time i posted people were confused
 Astrobytes: dbf: it happened for me during RAIC - next time I will write better code :D
 VizGhar: Or (more probably) same sh*t but a little bit faster :P
 Astrobytes: No, a bit slower!
 Nerchio: i got to bronze in code royale pogchamp
 VizGhar: Some clojure dev here? I have (def p hash-map) and calling `(def p (assoc p (keyword @actual) i))` doesn't seem to update it. Anybody know why?
 BananaInSpace: :p
 Westicles: I would go to #fr for clojure questions, a couple experts hang out there
 VizGhar: now I see my key is always nil&#160;:| so I found my answer just by asking question
 VizGhar: standard procedure
 bobth: Is there a way to split input AND compare them in one line
 bobth: in python
 bobth: like you have n = input().split()print(["same","different"][n[1]==n[0])
 bobth: how can this be on one line
 Westicles: put a semicolon between
 bobth: but what if I want to loop through multiple inputs like
 bobth: print([["same","different"][n[1]==n[0]for i in range(5)])
 bobth: but with n as input
 bobth: like using list comprehension or whatever that is
 BananaInSpace: eeaeaea
 BananaInSpace: eaeaeaeea
 Astrobytes: BananaInSpace: have you taken leave of yer senses laddie?
 BananaInSpace: wuh
 Westicles: Another articulate youngster
 Westicles: Let's talk about Wittgenstein, shall we?
 BananaInSpace: what?
 BananaInSpace: ea sports
 Astrobytes: lol Westicles
 VizGhar: Idk what that is but I'm inerested
 VizGhar: googled him... I'm a little bit less interested
 BananaInSpace: WittgensteinWittgensteinWittgensteinWittgensteinWittgenstein
 BananaInSpace: r.i.p
 BananaInSpace: he died
 VizGhar: Nope... he just give up. You make people brain dead. Stop spamming
 Astrobytes: He's gone for the moment
 LegendaryStone: FranckR34 do you mind sharing your code im curious what you did
 VizGhar: maybe message him directly&#160;:) Are you referring to some CoC?
 LegendaryStone: yes how do i direct message
 LegendaryStone: not really sure how
 Westicles: DM me for details
 FranckR34: i do
 Wontonimo: Question: I'm using a Mac for development and haven't done C++ for 20 years.  I've gotten C++17 to compile via command line and in a VSCode IDE.  Is there something else that you've (anyone here) used that is more enjoyable / is more helpful than VS code on Mac&#160;?
 Wontonimo: (totally forgot about xcode.  anyone here use xcode as their IDE?)
 APJames: i have a question about Coders Strike Back if anyone has played that game
 therealbeef: I'm doing it atm
 Astrobytes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/">http://how-to-properly-ask-a-question.surge.sh/</a>
 Astrobytes:&#160;;)
 Wontonimo: the real beer - why did you choose xcode?  (serious question)
 therealbeef: xcode?
 therealbeef: oh, i was answering James&#160;:)
 APJames: I'll private message you Kosher Beef
 APJames: :P
 APJames: messaged you beef
 therealbeef: Actually, Wontonimo, I also use MacOS. For codingame I use the webpage IDE because its assistant is better than xcode's for C++. I like xcode for Swift but for C++ its meh. Just havent gotten around to installing vscode yet
 RyanGilbert: where is the ref link
 struct: ref for what?
 RyanGilbert: found it
 RyanGilbert: to inv friends
 Katespizer: do anyone remember puzzle from clash, named like 'neighbour of pascal' with weird pascal triangle?
 struct: this one?

 Katespizer: no&#160;:(
 Katespizer: on input it had n integers like n=32,5,6 
 Heiwu: hi!
 Katespizer: and it was supposed to go like 2  5  6
 Katespizer: and 18 was the answer
 Heiwu: is it always around this time of day when this site is getting really slow?

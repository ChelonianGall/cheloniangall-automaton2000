 holite: do anybody know how to convert # to 1 and * to 0 in python??
 holite: in a long str
 holite: for ex.
 holite: #**#**##*** to 10010011000
 VizGhar: map
 VizGhar: or replace
 Flaaamort: <i>.join(map({'#':'1','*':'0'}.get, string))</i>
 Flaaamort: Using map as suggested
 Husoski: str.translate() might be better in Python.string.translate({35: '1', 42: '0'}) will convert '#' to 1 and '*' to '0', leaving all other characters unchanged.

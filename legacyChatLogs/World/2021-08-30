 PatrickMcGinnisII: ~170 shots of Vodka
 Astrobytes: lol
 Patel1515: Hi
 Cybertron415: so how is everyone today?
 Westicles: I think people in these weirdo countries don't know how to google.  Supposedly most of them don't understand the difference between FB and the internet
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Trying to lvl up, puzzle Binary Extension is giving me fits
 mybk: thank you Astrobytes, I didn't know how to read it, that's why I asked here :p 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 1 goal is fine, can't seem to merge the paths for multiple goals
 Astrobytes: no problem mybk :D
 Astrobytes: Westicles: "weirdo countries" eh? You being from the US and myself being from the UK disqualifies us from calling anyone else weird no?
 Astrobytes: International summits involving our respective leaders and politicians must be like fking Brony-con to the rest of the world.
 Westicles: I'm sure there's a more crowd-pleasing adjective, but you know what I mean.  Er, probably :P
 Astrobytes: lol
 jacek: bronycon? when?
 jacek: noice, space shooter already doubled the players
 BlaiseEbuth: (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
 mybk: Westicles, a great person is someone who knows how to use words to create friends, a worthless person is someone who whenever uses his mouth/words he creates enemies. From your way of talking/commenting you are not a team leader and you will never become one if you don't change your way of thinking/responding to others. 
 BlaiseEbuth: #Ponies_will_rule_the_world
 TinieblaOscura: haaaiii

 Astrobytes: jacek: is it any good?
 Westicles: mybk, I appreciate your kind words.  You may well be a great person or a team leader one day
 BlaiseEbuth: That's why dumb persons can't be great...&#160;:(

 PatrickMcGinnisII: not complex,  missiles added to basic rules... that's all i see.

 Astrobytes: #badlogic
 PatrickMcGinnisII: selling my rental, goes on market sept. 8th
 Astrobytes: Ah. Fed up with the hassle?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: everyday i do 4-5 hours work on it, boring AF
 PatrickMcGinnisII: market is HIGH
 Astrobytes: Fair. Get rid when you still can.
 Westicles: Before the hurricanes get it
 Astrobytes: That too
 Westicles: Or the flooding... wasn't Florida supposed to be underwater by now?
 Astrobytes: I think a lot of people hoped it would be :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I think lousiana is flooded, haven't watched news
 BlaiseEbuth: louisiana is naturally flooded
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I'm 300ft. above sea level.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Yeah, NOLA took some damage, thankfully not as bad as it could have been it seems
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The heat will kill me first, i can float.&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: I heard they all float down there.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: :poop:
 BlaiseEbuth: :balloon:
 Astrobytes: :balloon:
 Astrobytes: :D
 BlaiseEbuth: :clown:
 Westicles: 300ft, that's scary.  You've probably got 20 years or so
 JimmyJams: WITCH
 BlaiseEbuth: Massachusetts so?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: in 7 years, average temp will be 4 degrees higher during the solar maxima... all the crops will die ... gonna move to Appalachia.  I'll hear banjos playing, but I won't starve.&#160;;)
 BlaiseEbuth: Read cops... ^^
 Astrobytes: There are worse places you could go PatrickMcGinnisII, besides, banjos are feckin great
 BlaiseEbuth: Arctic gonna be a great place.
 Westicles: I'll always regret not learning to play the banjo back when I lived on the farm.  You can't play one in the city without getting murdered eventually
 PatrickMcGinnisII: My GF doesn't want to move.  She gets retirement benefit in like 5 years.  She doesn't have A/C in her house... she freakin' crazy
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh... Move to kentucky, there you can play banjo in cities
 PatrickMcGinnisII: favorite redneck pickup line "you sure do have a pretty mouth"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I need a cabin, a greenhouse, starlink, and ammo. heh.
 BlaiseEbuth: Remind me a reportage about us redneck rap. :3
 Astrobytes: Hey I play, well not recently, my banjer loud and proud, my elderly neighbour is half deaf mind you :P
 Astrobytes: Mulletcore?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Kinda showing my nerd, I play violin.  Tune it down a 1/2 step and the rednecks will love me.&#160;;)
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and I listen to heavy metal btw
 Astrobytes: Violin my arse, that's a fiddle :P
 Astrobytes: I was never allowed one as a child. I should get one. Maybe some bagpipes while I'm at it :imp:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I fingerpick the guitar, but everyone says it sounds like Hawaiian music
 BlaiseEbuth: A fiddle and some moonshine and you're ready to be a hillbilly
 Westicles: I can probably blow into a jug, we got enough for a band
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, CG-con here we come
 PatrickMcGinnisII: make sure the bagpipes spew fire

 darkhorse64: Honestly, I don't like this game a lot but I have noticed an interesting feature: missile chain explosion
 darkhorse64: oops scroll
 Astrobytes: still relevant, don't worry
 Astrobytes: shooting the missiles?
 Astrobytes: Or firing them in the blast radius of each other?
 darkhorse64: Either detonate yours or shoot the opponent's. For instance, you can kill your opponent by defending yourself with a chain reaction if your opponent is not careful enough to space his missiles
 Astrobytes: gotcha
 thunderegg: im new to coding can someone teach me
 BlaiseEbuth: Hello new to coding can someone teach me, I'm Blaise.
 thunderegg: im thunder
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: seems a reasonable cheese but also avoidable?
 darkhorse64: Simming all can be very complex. No, sorry. This is not a place where you learn to code
 Astrobytes: Yeah, it looks hardcore in terms of keeping track of everything perfectly.
 thunderegg: no it doesnt it seems easy but i forgot how to use the commands on every type of coding
 Astrobytes: thunderegg: here is where you come when you are comfortable coding in one ore more languages. 
 Astrobytes: *or
 darkhorse64: I am jotting ideas rn. If the game becomes really popular maybe I'll give it a real shot. But I definitely prefer board games
 BlaiseEbuth: How much do you pay to learn? :money_mouth:
 jacek: youll give a shot to space shooter?
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: well it should get some more users since it's potw
 darkhorse64: jacek: excellent pun
 darkhorse64: Abalone looks more attractive to me
 jacek: or checkers :unamused:
 BlaiseEbuth: or cheese
 darkhorse64: Only 15 users. Thibaud said he selects new puzzles when they have more than 20 users. Checkers is nearly done for me. I mean I am almost out of ideas for MCTS and I am still far away from #5
 Astrobytes: Hm. Must've been a bad start to the Monday&#160;;)
 darkhorse64: Sorry, I did not get the joke
 jacek: joke?
 darkhorse64: I am been working on Checkers for one month in parallel with Hypersonic 
 darkhorse64: not just Monday
 Astrobytes: darkhorse64: "Only 15 users. Thibaud said he selects new puzzles when they have more than 20 users."
 Astrobytes: Hence, bad start for Thibaud
 darkhorse64: The move gen is horribly complicated. MSmits would like the bitboarding. OK
 Astrobytes: move gen for checkers?
 darkhorse64: Abalone seems to require a 128 bit bitboard. New stuff to explore. Yes for Checkers
 jacek: 61 bits per player
 darkhorse64: gcc has native 128 bit int
 Astrobytes: Yeah, I tried to do checkers a while back and did something else instead.
 Astrobytes: Yes, it does. Very handy.
 darkhorse64: The Abalone board is 113 hexes
 Astrobytes: has jacek not NNd Abalone yet?
 jacek: huh
 jacek: abalone is like yavalath, 61 cells
 Illedan: Yo
 Illedan: Now the real fight starts :D
 darkhorse64: :flushed: I did 26 x 4 + 9
 darkhorse64: You are absolutely right
 jacek: you dont even need 128bit
 Astrobytes: lol
 darkhorse64: You may need it because you need guard bits for shifting on hexes. Y does not move pieces. Abalone does. This is an important difference for bitboarding
 darrendecoder: i dont understand annything but i want to learn but how?
 BlaiseEbuth: Wow Astrobytes. I'm discovering Grave Digger. :heart_eyes:
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: The oldskool German metal band?
 BlaiseEbuth: German? Oo
 Astrobytes: That's the only band I can think of called that
 BlaiseEbuth: With kilts and bagpipes?
 Astrobytes: I could be wrong.
 BlaiseEbuth: Ah yes. They're german... Dispointing...
 Astrobytes: Oh no, looked that up. They did an album (or a few songs) about the Scottish wars of independence
 BlaiseEbuth: Saw this <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xp5cnbTDJ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xp5cnbTDJ4</a>
 TimothyAlexisVass: I want enjoyable work and colleagues which I like&#160;:(
 Astrobytes: Nice BlaiseEbuth!
 Astrobytes: They're a good band btw, I didn't know they were still going tbh
 BlaiseEbuth: Why germans all want to be scottish or irish?
 Astrobytes: They don't?
 Astrobytes: TimothyAlexisVass: don't we all
 BlaiseEbuth: Grave digger, fiddler's green, patty gurdy...
 Astrobytes: You'll find Irish and Scottish sympathising bands in a lot of countries...
 Astrobytes: Imagine the carnage if they were French sympathising...
 Astrobytes: :D

 Astrobytes: I see it. Presumably CG must allow anonymous usernames. Or it's a bot.
 Astrobytes: Or both.
 Illedan: If you register with gmail I don't think you need a username before doing anything
 Astrobytes: That would explain it. How's FB going Illedan?

 Wontonimo: Hey Esharp, are you still working on wood 2&#160;? 
 Wontonimo: Justin-Truong, the test cases and the validation cases are different on purpose

 Justin-Truong: The second one can't run the code when my clone start to come out
 Justin-Truong: and my clone can't come up the elevator
 Wontonimo: interesting, the second one doesn't look like it has an elevator
 Justin-Truong: oh yes
 Justin-Truong: But what happen I coded to make an elevator
 Wontonimo: that's weird.  i've never seen that you can look at the validation results before.  it must be for just a few puzzles and it must be new

 a_loser: is anyone here
 a_loser: does anyone here enjoy doing clash?
 AllenAnalog: no
 AllenAnalog: no one does.
 a_loser: great
 a_loser: i regret doing clash since theyre mostly spaghetti problems
 a_loser: cant improve by coding like that
 a_loser: think i should start doing codeforces from now on..
 ProCoder03: you haven't tried bot programming yet&#160;!!
 a_loser: can't
 a_loser: sadly have no time for that :weary:
 ANONYMOUS42: what's that emoji lmao
 ProCoder03: instead of wasting it in CoC, try it 
 ANONYMOUS42: il looks like it's holding a sneeze
 a_loser: if you say so, then i will. hold up..
 ProCoder03: try Coders strike back
 ProCoder03: its pretty easy
 eulerscheZahl: jacek what's that obsession about posting frog articles?
 AllenAnalog: someone send footlocker cache bypass
 AllenAnalog: on atc
 AllenAnalog: ty
 AllenAnalog: try cock
 Penguronik: sebt
 Penguronik: sent
 Penguronik: check your door
 AllenAnalog: :smiley:
 Penguronik: :cry:
 Penguronik: nice balls, may I hold them?
 AllenAnalog: i like ya cock g
 eulerscheZahl: sorry, was eating breakfast
 Illedan: With bacon?
 eulerscheZahl: i'm vegetarian
 Illedan: Think they have veggie bacon too&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: i don't have to try everything. i don't feel like i'm missing out on it
 Illedan: You eat eggs?
 eulerscheZahl: to some degree. I eat them when they are inside other food like cakes
 eulerscheZahl: i don't really like the taste
 Illedan: Same, unless they are cooked crispi beyond recognition
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://yare.io/replay/li1gu2ax5t5">https://yare.io/replay/li1gu2ax5t5</a>my first victory against will-bot. Only took 20min :D
 eulerscheZahl: surely lots of things to tweak
 Illedan: Seems like GOD
 Illedan: What is that connection thing&#160;? You harvest moons or something?
 eulerscheZahl: i chase the opponent way out of the map (skip to the end and then move down)
 eulerscheZahl: yes, the stars generate energy over time
 eulerscheZahl: you can harvest that. and pass it to your other units
 Illedan: And if you create a path from it to your spawn you get more?
 Illedan: aha
 eulerscheZahl: when the base has enough energy, you get a new unit
 eulerscheZahl: you don't have to build a chain. you can also move back and forth (even more efficient in some cases)
 DioGenes412: hello everyone:grin:
 Illedan: LOL, I never use my distance for 1 of my wizards in FB :D I used the value from the other wizard :sob:
 jacek: you dont like frog articles?
 Illedan: Sure, got some good ones?
 eulerscheZahl: and now, when you correct the wrong distance, other things will fall apart?
 Illedan: We will see
 eulerscheZahl: Ille in submit
 Illedan: Always
 Illedan: I have some stupid other feature in test too. But I'll revert it soon if it looks bad
 Illedan: I had some games where 1 wizard used 5 rounds to wander off towards the side. 
 eulerscheZahl: but the other was twice as fast
 Illedan: I wish
 Illedan: Wierd how I get shitloads more games vs reCur than pb4
 eulerscheZahl: RNG
 eulerscheZahl: and there would be MrBrown too. but his bot didn't like the language update
 eulerscheZahl: i think he might still be 3rd otherwise
 eulerscheZahl: anyways, afk :soccer:
 Illedan: bye
 jacek: :notebook:?
 CopimatorKung: Hello
 HHHHHanonymous: hi

 jacek: all i have to do is do nothing for a week
 Maxim251: :clap:
 AntiSquid: bullet velocity&#160;? seriously
 MagirescuTudor: I always miss online bot programming competitions. How to find out about them?
 dreadylein: in terms of cg&#160;? you can apply in advanced , prettymuch a few days after the last contest ends, after registration you will get a mail reminding you 
 MagirescuTudor: outside of this website
 dreadylein: close to contest start
 dreadylein: you mean contests outside of codingame&#160;?
 MagirescuTudor: yep
 dreadylein: in the cg discord is a channel for external contests, guess that your best bet if you dont wanna work through a few pages once in a while
 MagirescuTudor: thanks!
 dreadylein: your welcome
 tran1903xd: hi
 darkhorse64: For any mods out there, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-1-ngr-basic-radar/191453/11">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/community-puzzle-1-ngr-basic-radar/191453/11</a> looks very much as a spam to me
 jacek: youre not mod? oO
 eulerscheZahl: :eyes:
 eulerscheZahl: oh, robo deleted it already
 geppoz: Maybe OOT, but faster ask that ask if can ask. Question for bash gurus:
 geppoz: why this:
 geppoz: bc&lt;&lt;&lt;`dd`
 geppoz: gives an error insted of give me a prompt?
 geppoz: if I give with a pipe, it works:
 geppoz: bc&lt;&lt;&lt;`dd`|cat
 geppoz: or if i give with parenthesis, it works:
 geppoz: (bc&lt;&lt;&lt;`dd`)
 Gogovich: hello everyone
 borrel: @geppoz i think dd stdout isaTTY
 borrel: changes dd behavior
 borrel: i thinks
 tssw: @geppoz, thats an interesting finding. I think that when u use pipe or (), the dd is probably running under another bash process
 tssw: but I'm not sure
 geppoz: y, it seems so
 geppoz: something related to "lastpipe" option?
 geppoz: well that was related to your nice solution to a clash TBH :D
 geppoz: @tssw you solved it as:
 geppoz: (bc&lt;&lt;&lt;"obase=2;`dd`/2")|wc -c
 geppoz: but studying it, I found out the parenthesis are not needed when you have the pipe
 geppoz: so there a 2 char shorter solution&#160;;)
 geppoz: instead the parenthesis are needed if you dont have a pipe after
 tssw: yeah, was too cautions
 geppoz: but I can't understand why that
 geppoz:&#160;:(
 tssw: they are probably not needed in CoC
 tssw: bash -c 'bc&lt;&lt;&lt;`dd`'
 tssw: works

 holyterror: yes I want to make games
 AntiSquid: you can make text adventures in bash
 Mohand.: me to 
 Mohand.: after python i want c++ or c#
 holyterror: make sure not to over dip like I did. I probably would be making games rn if not for the fact I jumped around languages a lot.
 holyterror: @AntiSquid I don't know bash and C# works fine for now especially since I plan to migrate to unity.

 Mohand.: @Gogovich hi 
 holyterror: hi gogvich

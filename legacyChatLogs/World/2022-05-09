 Kokoz: Hello all,Can someone help me with my project in python?<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://onlinegdb.com/D2d_PSIOW">https://onlinegdb.com/D2d_PSIOW</a>^This is an example of what I have to do. I have a list with events and the output should be week1, week2 etc.. The probelm is that I dont know how to do the string thing in week1, week2 where events are one under the other. Any help would be appreciated&#160;:)

 Darleanow: Hello,  i have a question concerning python functions arguments
 Darleanow: the * one and the ** one
 Darleanow: correct me if i'm, the * is for any amount of args, but what about **&#160;?
 j4at: kwargs
 Nik05: hey Darleanow
 Darleanow: Hello j4at, yeah i know, but i don't know the difference&#160;!
 Darleanow: hello Nik05, it's been a while&#160;!
 Darleanow: because for *arg you can give variable amount of args
 Darleanow: which is the same of kwargs no&#160;???
 j4at: and using **kwargs you can variable amount of keyword args
 j4at: and then it get transferred into a dict inside the function

 Urutar: Do you need help with the puzzle, Espequair?
 Espequair: eh, I think i figured it out mostly, it's just a matter of executing
 Urutar: Alright^^
 Espequair: I'm just trying to balance out spaghetti code and understandable code
 Espequair: wait no
 Espequair: I've found a counter example for my algorithm
 Espequair: I'm just a couple of digits off

 5DN1L: thanks Urutar for thanking me
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 trentdestroyer: was just testing the stuff
 Urutar: Why people feel a need to swear and insult so much, I'll never get
 Urutar: Sure 5DN1L&#160;:)
 5DN1L: neither will I
 trentdestroyer: we friends we testing the site
 Urutar: There are private channels...
 ZndrBrok: 5DN1L is calm like a rock&#160;! And the one who pretend that u are to much sensitive should maybe check the mirror :P
 5DN1L: I won't judge :P

 ZndrBrok: :P
 Urutar: And why do you feel the need to test manners or social rules / netiquette?
 Urutar: Eh, back on topic I guess^^
 Urutar: I think I'll try my hand at/on creating a submission&#160;:) (which one is correct? Trying ones hand at or on sth?)
 5DN1L: contribution?
 Urutar: Ah yeas
 Urutar: That's the one I meant
 DegenGaming: lol
 5DN1L: nice, will check it out when you've submitted it
 Urutar: Might take a while - is there a playground here on cg where I can test this stuff, or should I just start creating one?
 5DN1L: I think you can create it and keep it private and test first
 Urutar: Neat&#160;:)
 ZndrBrok: Do a CodinGame who use somehow "chat rules" :P  Even like a input... All chat  moderators will upvote your contribution :P
 Urutar: Not a bad idea, but not what I had in mind for now - but how about you make that one? :D
 Yozamu: Hey dudes, regarding community puzzle, any hint&#160;? 
 Espequair: just be worry of the Scunthorpe problem Urutar
 Yozamu: I mean finding a solution is a thing, but having the smallest one..
 Espequair: try to compute how long the solution *should* be, it'll give you a pretty good hint
 Yozamu: Are you advising to make something like brute force&#160;? Like, a backtracking thing&#160;? 
 Yozamu: Because I kinda wanted to avoid it (I'm bad at simulating things, never know how to store / organize data) but if that's the way..
 Espequair: nah, not really 
 Yozamu: ah
 Urutar: The Scunthorpe problem? You mean, putting accidental swear words in the submission?
 Urutar: I think I'll be able to avoid that^^
 Espequair: more like, as a problem the players should take care of urutar
 Espequair: Yozuma: but if you know how long the solution is, you will get a pretty good hint at how the solution is built
 Urutar: Alright? Not quite sure where that should lead me though
 Yozamu: Hmm ok, not sure how it should help me, unless it just makes me understand a specific pattern to build the sequence
 Espequair:&#160;:)
 Espequair: Urutar&#160;: yeah, your contribution should make sure the solutions don't fall for the problem
 Espequair: if you do do an automoderator
 Urutar: Ah, alright
 Urutar: Nah, not doing an automoderator; I'll create a regular puzzle I think

 NewCoder09: what league are you in?
 Tony_Hu: i want write in C#
 NewCoder09: what league 
 NewCoder09: did you just start it?
 NewCoder09: is it telling you what to do?
 Tony_Hu: i think so
 NewCoder09: ok thats the tutorial 
 NewCoder09: is it telling you to make something x,y?
 NewCoder09:&#160;?
 Tony_Hu: invalid input. Expected 'x y power' but found '30003000300033000 50'
 Espequair: looks like there's only 2 numbersthere, it's expecting 3
 NewCoder09: i just want to know how you can't do tutorial its simple it tells you what to do 
 NewCoder09: like it LITERALY TELS YOU WHAT TO DO
 NewCoder09: so i accidently turned caps lock on 
 NewCoder09: sorry
 StevenV: :D
 Urutar: Tony_Hu, maybe you should write '3000 3000 50' instead of '30003000300033000 50'?
 Urutar: Seems like you munged up your output somehow.
 NewCoder09: where is this in tutorial 
 NewCoder09:&#160;?????
 Urutar: I think this is in mad pod racing and not the tutorial.
 Link_jon: print("answer")instead ofcalcuate answerthen print
 Link_jon: oh appearntly i was 7 lightyears behind in chat
 Urutar: No problem, happens to best of us^^
 Link_jon: so uh. whats happening down here?
 StevenV: hello guys
 NewCoder09: it has to be the tutorial because i followed him and i dont see him on this board anywhere
 NewCoder09: my brain hurts now 
 NewCoder09: hello StevenV
 Tony_Hu: I'm sorry I just started playing this, I'm not very proficient, why doesn't it even show a style input?

 Automaton2000: i guess there is some kind of search
 Urutar: Automaton2000 A search for a nice day?
 Automaton2000: but do you compute log(parentvisits) for every children? or just once and just put the value there

 bdrnglm: I took a certification test

 feptkdie: Almost done
 StevenV: hello guys,
 StevenV: should I learn python before trying NN?
 5DN1L: depends on whether you want to write your NN in python, I guess?
 jacek: NN can be written in any language. python has more tools and libs for that
 Ryanless: any good in-deptdiscussion or tutorials for multi-agent system... al the page gives are some wiki links -.-
 Ryanless: all*
 StevenV: I think I need to understand those libraries like Tensoreflow,... then try to apply them into problems like those multi on CG
 Darleanow: Guys, i was wondering if it was possible to convert a string to a class object (in python) for example, is there a way to convert "p1.get_perimeter()" to p1.get_perimeter()
 10100111001: Not 100% sure but I think eval("p1.get_perimeter()") could work
 Darleanow: okay thanks&#160;!!
 Darleanow: and is there any utility of using dir function in a python program
 Darleanow: because it gives all the functions associated to a type/var
 MSmits: StevenV worrying about using tensorflow for multis is like worrying whether your outfit is aerodynamically optimized when jogging.
 Sabsterrexx: yeah eval() function would work for calling a class using a string darle
 Sabsterrexx: and idk what you mean by ultility of using dir() can u be more specific
 Link_jon: (i mean. i usually use lua. on of the least usefull things ever)
 MSmits: just use normal algorithms and techniques, get top 10 and then worry about it. In most multis there isn't even a NN at the top. It's mostly boardgames
 jacek: maybe he wants to solve that bioengineering problem with NNs
 MSmits: which problem?
 Darleanow: dir gives u every functions associated to a type, try a print(dir(list));
 Darleanow: but i was wondering what was the use of it&#160;??
 MSmits: oh right that problem
 jacek: isnt dir used for duck typing?
 Darleanow: wut is duck typing&#160;?
 MSmits: :duck:
 j4at: I wonder if is there o(n) solution for the events puzzle. I can't guess it&#160;:( 
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#In_Python">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#In_Python</a>
 BigBadStopwatch_4678: if it looks like a duck, then it'll be treated as a duck
 Link_jon: there is, its just going to be a pain
 Darleanow: AHAHAHHA
 Darleanow: naughty boy &gt;:(
 Darleanow: so basically what you're saying is that it's only use is for giving functions of an object&#160;?
 MSmits: j4at I don't know either, but there is probably some systematic way to approach it. It's always best to start with 000 for example (the amount of 0's based on the sequence size)
 MSmits: and after that, 0001
 MSmits: or however many 00s, just with a 1 at the end
 MSmits: maybe look for the smallest code that fits almost completely (except the last digit)
 Link_jon: definitely need a main loop to continue untill if finds a string containing each (theres another loop) Agree with MSmits, garrentee its best to start with a string of zeros, due to left to right number, and we need as small as possible. the 'as small as possible' part is the biggest problem
 j4at: Well i aready know that starting with 0s is guaranteed to work
 MSmits: probably it's best to do it heuristically and see where heuristics go wrong
 Link_jon: pretty much yeh
 MSmits: where it goes wrong, you add some brute forcing
 j4at: I tried but the system is gets complex later
 Link_jon: biggest problem it will have is at '100' type numbers
 j4at: I don't want to add brute forcing tho
 MSmits: maybe heuristics will be enough
 MSmits: have you succeeded in making a solution work?
 Link_jon: i have yet to begin coding so...
 MSmits: just any solution, not necessarily the shortest one
 j4at: I already have a solution that works :3
 j4at: But I need a O(n) one
 Link_jon: we require the shortest one
 MSmits: No you dont understand
 MSmits: I mean do you have  a solution that fits the requirements except it isnt the shortest
 MSmits: based on heuristics
 Illedan: You can't have O(n) You need O(x*n)
 Link_jon: i guess we could probably trim from that heuristic
 Link_jon: hm
 j4at: I mean by n length of the result
 j4at: and length is not x*n it's x**n +2
 MSmits: What if you do this: Start with 000, then make a list of numbers that fit the best (only need 1 extra digit, otherwise 2), add the smallest of those.
 jacek: so far no question in the forum
 MSmits: x**n+2 is also O(x**n)
 MSmits: Illedan said you can have O(x*n)
 j4at: yep
 j4at: but it's not x*n
 MSmits: your solution isn't
 MSmits: maybe the best one is
 j4at: Yeah it seems he knows better then me
 MSmits: I am guessing he solved it
 Illedan: Did not :P
 Illedan: Looking at it now
 MSmits: Seems hard for a medium puzzle
 Illedan: Agreed
 MSmits: but maybe there's a simple thing we are missing
 MSmits: I am sure you could make some GA to optimize it, but it may miss the best solution
 Illedan: Yeah, that wouldn't be acceptable for a medium puzzle
 j4at: indeed
 Link_jon: ... i just had an idea... gimmie a min (hour)
 Link_jon: i believe i have the secret.its.... kinda simple. and i am probably skipping steps in my head
 MSmits: should get that looked at :P
 Scarfield: xD
 Link_jon: the fact im skipping steps? hm. probably. ill find out
 Illedan: Hm, at worst 729 strings to order
 Link_jon: anyway i think its as easy as just literally comparing the value of the codes to eachother and making sure you dont put higher value codes in front
 MSmits: yeah but they need to match digits to compress
 Illedan: True
 Link_jon: hmmmmm. dang this just got harder
 Link_jon: i forgot about overlaps
 MSmits: that's half the puzzle
 Link_jon: thats like 80% of the puzzle. the rest is coding your answer lul
 Link_jon: sigh. need an algorithm to find simplest overlaps
 Link_jon: and even then it will need fixing due to shortest might not be bestest from numbers being in places that cause biger total number
 Link_jon: pft i bet a random number generator could eventually solve the puzzle
 Link_jon: lul
 MSmits: yes, you should outsource to a million monkeys on typewriters
 Link_jon: just apply some checks and random
 Link_jon: rerandom everytime it gets it wrong lul
 Link_jon: XD
 MSmits: for laughs, please translate lul from Dutch to English
 jacek: so, GA?
 Scarfield: xd smitsi
 Link_jon: ...wow. huh
 jacek: oO
 MSmits: just letting you know what a Dutch person thinks when you use that in a conversation&#160;:)
 Link_jon: and ive just been randomly reapplying vowels to lol.  thats strange
 jacek: lulz
 j4at: GA doesn't make sense here
 MSmits: well the Dutch used it first so :P
 j4at: there is probably an easy solution
 Illedan: BruteForce ftw
 MSmits: yeah i am sure there is
 j4at: Bruteforce is slow :3
 Scarfield: lel is also an abbriviation of Low Elo Legends from t90 (a age of empires streamer/youtuber)
 Link_jon: brute force is basically random like i was talking about
 mdaw: best solution is to put all answers into map, you can't beat that
 MSmits: bruteforce is a bit of a misnomer sometimes. It can have a lot of smart pruning in it and still be bruteforce
 Illedan: Some Trie might work
 j4at: Randomly checknig is even worst than my solution rn :3
 MSmits: random will be bad yeah
 Scarfield: which is the bruter brute force, a smart one, or an optimized one
 Link_jon: optimized
 MSmits: yeah
 Scarfield: but a brute isnt smart
 MSmits: if you make it too smart there is a point where you cant call it brute force anymore. Optimization will never stop it being brute force
 Link_jon: exactly
 MSmits: minimax is brute force, ab pruned minimax is still brute force
 jacek: is this it? <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-common-supersequence/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-common-supersequence/</a>
 MSmits: similar i guess
 Scarfield: thats only for 2 strings?
 Scarfield: yea
 struct: Hi
 Link_jon: Hai
 Scarfield: oi
 struct: Scarfield I only need to parse inputs now
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/61mmRgB.png">https://i.imgur.com/61mmRgB.png</a>
 Scarfield: Nice!
 struct: Graphics will still need work
 struct: Im not very happy with it
 Ose: Hi
 Illedan: I think this event is supposed to be solved like a tree. As you need to combine as many as possible in 1
 struct: also I have a few design questions
 struct: should a player get multiple turns in a row for each dice
 struct: or output all moves in the same turn?
 derjack: 40th in search race! NN with degree and thrust output only
 struct: Nice derjack
 Illedan: Nice derjack&#160;:)
 Scarfield: all moves in one i would say. when hitting double, you get 4 moves
 jacek: eeyup
 Scarfield: how many inputs?
 Link_jon: ugh
 jacek: in connect6 you would do 2 moves in one turn?
 Link_jon: trying to figure out how to calculate every single possible pattern
 derjack: 8 - vx, vy, sin(angle), cos(angle) next cp dist x, next cp dist y, dist x cp1cp2, disty cp1cp2
 Scarfield: no angle cp1cp2?
 derjack: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/633707137">https://www.codingame.com/replay/633707137</a> solves in 350 while my GA search in 334
 derjack: it can figure it out from dist x and dist y, no?
 Scarfield: oh yea, misread
 Scarfield: but cewl&#160;:)
 struct: yeah my current referee handles all at once
 derjack: but this is hard <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/search-race">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/search-race</a> solves in 198 and my GA is 110
 Illedan: Looks very good&#160;:)
 struct: But then plays one move per frame
 Illedan: Bad link derjack?
 Scarfield: btw struct, when hitting 2 dice of the same number, you get 4 moves, 4 turns in a row and 4 moves seems too much of an advantage?
 derjack: :x <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/633707965">https://www.codingame.com/replay/633707965</a>
 struct: well I have that rule
 Illedan: Yeah, that map is hard :D
 struct: of 4 moves
 struct: But to remove is just 1 line or something
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/633708296">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/633708296</a>
 Scarfield: im just saying my gut feeling is that its more fair that you output all your moves same turn, not a turn per dice
 struct: yes I have that
 jacek: imo you need to print all moves in 1 turn
 Lavecki: anyone able to help me out on The Descent. I know I need to use mountainH somehow but I dont know what will pull that value
 struct: you can also output random if you want&#160;:)
 struct: Also the moves you output must be in the correct order
 Scarfield: correct order?
 struct: well 1 move can change the future moves
 MSmits: jacek that's like that childrens game where they jump on the numbers
 jacek: Lavecki you need mountainH to find index of highest mountain
 MSmits: only you do it with a car
 struct: if you move c1 to c3 and you had no pieces on c3 then you can move c3 to c5 on next move for example
 Lavecki: yea i know that much, just not sure how to get it to relate to each mountain. Sorta stuck
 Scarfield: ah sure
 jacek: MSmits skip jump?
 MSmits: yeah that
 jacek: Lavecki there are hints on the left
 MSmits: Lavecki, you have a main loop where you output a move and within that you make your own move to select the highest mountain to attack
 Lavecki: ok, ill just keep trying
 MSmits: make your own loop sry
 MSmits: I think the main problem coders face when they first try The Descent is just understanding how the main loop works and the input/output
 MSmits: once you get that, future puzzles become easier
 Lavecki: yea, i know what i need to do, just not how to do it
 Lavecki: im also very new to coding, so not sure if thats part of it or not
 MSmits: are you doing this in python?
 Lavecki: java
 MSmits: allright, so you have the while true loop right?
 MSmits: thats the main loop
 Lavecki: yea, got that
 MSmits: within that is a for loop. The for loop goes by all the mountains
 Lavecki: yep, grabs each mountain height for mH
 MSmits: you have to make a variable called "tallest mountain height" or find a better name
 MSmits: and also "tallest mountain indeX"
 MSmits: but make a shorter name for them
 MSmits: the index is between 0 and 8
 MSmits: you initiate tallest mountain height to -1, then check each mountain to see if it's taller than the tallest mountain so far
 MSmits: if its taller, you store the index in the tallest mountain index
 MSmits: once you are past all mountains, you have the tallest mountain index and you output it
 Lavecki: feels like the given mountainH is superfluous then
 MSmits: no its not, you need to know the height
 MSmits: otherwise you dont know which is tallest
 Lavecki: k
 Lavecki: ill keep working on it then
 MSmits: you have an if statement saying if ( mountainH &gt; tallest_mountain_H) talles_mountain_index = i  or something like that 
 MSmits: oh and also update the tallest_mountain_H variable to the new tallest height
 struct: also one more design question sry, should I even give a player inputs if he will have no moves to output?
 Scarfield: it would make it easier for players wanting to reuse tree, but not necessary
 MSmits: dont they need to know the history of the opponents moves?
 struct: I will just give all the moves opponent did
 MSmits: ah
 Scarfield: yea makes sense
 struct: if you passed for 3 turns in a row
 MSmits: best is to test it out, write a bot for it, see what is easier
 struct: I give 3 turns pending 
 struct: I dont write bots
 MSmits: not often but you do write them
 struct: I never wrote a bot to test any of the games I ported
 MSmits: that's true
 Scarfield: but then i cant make a bot using the entire time to think about all the things it cannot do
 jacek: then how do you make bosses?
 MSmits: poorly :P
 Scarfield: darkhorse makes them :p
 MSmits: oh he makes them hard
 struct: I would delete othello and release it again with the book thing
 struct: But too many players
 MSmits: the book thing? You mean forced random starts?
 struct: yes
 struct: not random 
 struct: Balanced openings
 struct: +1-1
 MSmits: random balanced openings you mean?
 struct: I guess
 jacek: xot8
 MSmits: i mean there has to be some random, or i can still just book it
 Lavecki: MSmits, got it thanks
 MSmits: ah great&#160;:)
 Scarfield: :muscle:
 struct: large list has 10k openings
 struct: +2-2
 jacek: but othello is release long ago, and only recurse rage quited over books
 struct: the small has 3.6k
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: 3.6k is more than enough
 MSmits: the +1 -1 part is annoying though
 MSmits: that means the game is already solved against one of the two players
 MSmits: the bots are good enough that this may decide the game, some make hardly any mistakes
 struct: yeah
 MSmits: but 0 0 starts will be quite rare
 struct: It will probably make no diference
 MSmits: there arent many 100% balanced starts unfortunately
 MSmits: (starts that are guessed to be solved as a draw)
 struct: or I can just do like amazons
 struct: I dont even check if its balanced or not
 MSmits: well it will cause noise on the leaderboard to have unbalanced starts. I don't know how bad that is. It may not be
 struct: But no one plays that game
 MSmits: clobber is unbalanced by definition, amazons too i guess, no draws right?
 struct: yeah
 struct: its possible because you play 2 games though
 MSmits: with a sufficiently complex game it makes no difference
 MSmits: but othello is not very complex
 MSmits: like oware and bandas and such. They are near-solvable
 MSmits: then balance is pretty important, because bots make too few mistakes
 struct: so similar to c4?
 MSmits: yeah similar, though i think c4 is less complex than othello 
 MSmits: amazons and clobber arent though
 jacek: they are all complex for bots within 100ms
 jacek: or has science gone too far?
 struct: depends on the computer
 MSmits: mmh i dont know. If i analyze those oware games, you have 200 turns and for the top bots maybe 2 or 3 mistakes
 MSmits: c4 similar
 MSmits: othello also,  i completely counter booked dbdr and there were a few versions of his gameplay where he played flawlessly
 MSmits: so i would draw those
 MSmits: bandas is a perfect example of a game where the unbalanced start hurts a lot. The best bots can solve the game after 10 moves or so. In many starts, you can tell from the mcts statistics that there is no way to win 
 MSmits: it would have benefitted from mirror games
 MSmits: but then you'd have a ton of draws among top bots, like in uttt
 struct: Well its fair
 MSmits: yeah
 struct: You dont want to lose because of unbalance.
 MSmits: I agree
 struct: Maybe backgammon will also have this problem
 struct: But blame java rng
 MSmits: I will
 MSmits: I just looked at java for that descent puzzle
 MSmits: made me think there's more to blame java for :P
 MSmits: anyways, gotta go for a bit. I'll try to be online a bit more in the near future. I want to go back to coding more. I should have some time
 Scarfield: sounds good&#160;:) cya
 MSmits: bye&#160;:)
 Scarfield: but i think java has been blamed for everything already
 MSmits: yep, I am just piling on
 Link_jon: java causes OOP
 Link_jon: caused*
 Link_jon: and that is its biggest crime.
 struct: cya
 jacek: kree java!
 struct: Scarfield what should the output be if a player wants to move a piece that is on the bar?
 struct: bar = eaten peace
 Scarfield: if a player has a piece on the bar, its the only piece it can move, so could just be the dice number
 struct: currently its only dice and number, so:  cout &lt;&lt; "d6" &lt;&lt; endl;
 struct: ok
 Scarfield: you can get many pieces on the bar when in a bad situation, so id not needed i would say
 struct: I meant d and dice number sorry
 struct: I guess I dont need the d
 Scarfield: xD
 Scarfield: im holding back improper comebacks
 struct: Ok its pretty much ready now
 Scarfield: sweet
 struct: I think replay in same conditions will not work well with secure random
 struct: but w/e
 Darleanow: hello again guys
 Darleanow: anyone have idea on how to put a lambda inside a print

 j4at: That should work
 j4at: Darleanow
 j4at: You are maybe forgetting to input the input.
 jacek: or to move it move it
 Watsonka99: Hi, wondering if anyone can help. I'm trying to implement a beam search but the majority of the resources I find are related to NLP. is there any good I can look to learn more aboutit
 pindsz: @Darleanow, not sure if it's what you wanted but... print((lambda n:n*n*n)(int(input())))
 Noneoneoneone: hows it going everyone
 Darleanow: no, it's working guys
 struct: Now the real question 50 or 100ms?
 Darleanow: i just want to know how i can shorten it
 bingler: print((lambda x:x*x*x)(int(input())))
 quandaledingle: hey fellas! quandale dingle here
 bingler: lmfao what's up quandale dingle
 asdjfkl: hello!
 Seanski_2005: goodbye!
 jacek: :no_mouth:
 jacek: struct backgammon seems quite complex game, so maybe 100ms
 struct: ok
 struct: im gonna write stub now
 jacek: stub
 NewCoder09: sdtub
 NewCoder09: stub*
 Link_jon: ... the autogenned lua code got me to rank 260 in code royale.
 Link_jon: i didnt even know i was ranked at all
 Link_jon: i guess i randomly poked at it sometime or another
 NewCoder09: im about to try code royale haven't tryed it 
 carstenhag: is it normal that the tests take ages to run?
 NewCoder09: tried*
 NewCoder09: carstenhag yes that is normall
 carstenhag: sad :D
 jacek: what tests
 carstenhag: test cases
 NewCoder09: for what?
 carstenhag: clash of code
 carstenhag: what else is there?
 carstenhag: apart from the bot game thing
 jacek: they are fast
 VizGhar:&#160;:) there is more... but you are kotlin dev I see
 jacek: puzzles, optim puzzles, multiplayer games, codegolfs
 jacek: oh, kotlin compiler has some problems here
 VizGhar: Kotlin compiles probably slowest of them all
 carstenhag: ahh ok i only use kotlin haha
 NewCoder09: yeah 
 Westicles: so the achievement for starting 12 events, is that really for 12 contests?  it doesn't seem connected to puzzle/clash events
 NewCoder09: hi Westicles 
 Westicles: hey NewCoder09
 VizGhar: Idk... but I receives +1 for "hidden contest" i didn't even submit to
 carstenhag: is there a way to see an overview of code clash puzzles?
 NewCoder09: before you start?
 carstenhag: yeah&#160;:)
 NewCoder09:  no 
 NewCoder09: sadly
 carstenhag: ah thats too bad
 jacek: that would be not fair for reverse eh
 carstenhag: I can link to a contribution but there's no list? weird
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/">https://eulerschezahl.herokuapp.com/codingame/puzzles/</a>
 struct: jacek make a NN to write statements please
 jacek: ask Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: that would be too much for me
 NewCoder09: is AutomatonNN working?
 struct: rank 1 nice
 Link_jon: kkewwwwwllnesas
 jacek: struct bash D starter codes not working :v
 struct: too bad
 jacek: and fox already there
 jacek: is based on secure random?
 j4at: struct. even state of the art NN can't do that perfectly  :grimacing:
 struct: cg yeah
 struct: actions must be outputted separated by a&#160;;
 struct: Ill add the statement later
 waterproofsodium: jacek is always in this chat
 waterproofsodium: I just found a video from early last year where he was here
 jacek: huh
 Darleanow: print((lambda x:x*x*x)(int(input())))
 Darleanow: bingler if u still there
 Darleanow: when u pass the X arg

 Darleanow: u pinged, its when u write the name&#160;;)
 Darleanow: okay thank you man&#160;!!

 antiwonto: [auto] hey MAWAAW dont paste those links here.  Use the channel #clash
 darkhorse64: struct: regarding dices, I'll suggest that you give only two numbers
 struct: ok
 darkhorse64: let the user sort out doubles
 struct: but keep the rule 
 struct: ah ok
 waterproofsodium: when will my clash score update?
 waterproofsodium: it did not update for 3 days :unamused:
 struct: because its harder to climb and you will get less points
 struct: you already have 4.8k out of 5k
 struct: to get 5k you need rank 1
 struct: I think I already told you this
 Darleanow: hello guys, i'm struggling on this code&#160;:
 Darleanow: class Coordinate: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b05b95b-28ab-463c-97ee-e4a5a430737c">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/5b05b95b-28ab-463c-97ee-e4a5a430737c</a>
 Darleanow: i get raised a Type error 
 Darleanow: TypeError: add_coordinates() missing 1 required positional argument: 'c2'
 waterproofsodium: struct I am wondering why id doesn't update. because my score is constant all the time. even if it's "harder to climb" it should change at least 1 score point as my performance is not constant
 struct: waterproofsodium the formula should be 5000**((410784-2744+1)/410784)
 struct: 410784 is the number of players in clash leaderboard
 struct: 5000 is maximum points
 struct: 2744 is my rank in clash
 waterproofsodium: yay
 waterproofsodium: completed a clash as 1 of only 2 people :P
 waterproofsodium: and thanks for sharing the formula
 j4at: Darleanow you need to use @staticmethod decorator
 j4at: like this 
 j4at: class Coordinate: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3405a58a-1a36-49ca-8944-01f13f2ec062">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3405a58a-1a36-49ca-8944-01f13f2ec062</a>
 Darleanow: i solved it using a different way
 Darleanow: just had to init object before assignating values to it
 j4at: You can also set default values for x and y and then do this class Coordinate: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8a1fd8b-7db3-4641-8453-3501ea70f7d1">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/f8a1fd8b-7db3-4641-8453-3501ea70f7d1</a>
 Dren: or just define an __add__

 j4at: yes a lot better
 j4at: I finally found an O(n) solution for the event's puzzle not even O(x*n) :D It took me only serval hours :3
 chrz: can someone give me a hint on "Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1"?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: chrz gone?
 Dren: reddit.com
 Dren: r/codingame doesn't seem very active
 chrz: No
 snoyes: chrz: what's the secret to winning at Guess Who&#160;?
 Link_jon: ...dumb question: whats O(n)
 Link_jon: or moreso just; whats O
 snoyes: means as the input gets longer, the time/space it takes increases linearly rather than, for example,  exponentially,
 chrz: I never played :D
 jzen: Link_jon <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation</a>
 Link_jon: huh
 chrz: so  back to shadow of the knight. Right now im just using if statements to catch the strings and adjust my x/y accordingly
 Link_jon: so im guessing you managed to do the pain that i thought would need at minium three for loops... in one for loop length of n (length of code)&#160;??err. sorry about interupting the knights table
 Link_jon: well. code that we output*
 snoyes: Link_Jon: So it's not really about the lines of code; it's more to do with how many times you go through a loop, for example.
 snoyes: If you make a single pass with no looping, then it's O(1), regardless of how many lines that single pass is. It doesn't change for a longer input.
 Link_jon: Yeah. n == length of the code in that puzzle. Characters
 Link_jon: not lines of code
 snoyes: If it's O(n), that means double the input takes double the time or storage space
 snoyes: If it's O(n^2), that means double the input takes 4 times the time or space
 Link_jon: hmm. O(n) is generic isnt it
 Link_jon: i was thinking you were refrencing the variable from the puzzle, for whatever reason.... even after looking at the O(n) and how its logic
 snoyes: chrz: and how do you decide where to jump next?
 chrz: Im getting the next direction each run "while true"
 chrz: i suppose
 snoyes: ok, that's the direction, but what coordinate do you go to?
 snoyes: you don't take a single step
 chrz: oh i do
 chrz: like this
 chrz:  else if (bombDir == "UL") {
 Link_jon: (Oh hey isnt that a C..?)
 snoyes: chrz: you don't want to take a single step; that will take too long in most cases.
 snoyes: you want to make a big jump
 chrz: Are you proposing something like (xmax - x) / 2?should be more efficient your way but i cant even make a single jump with my code
 Link_jon: h
 snoyes: something like that
 jzen: chrz Are you remembering to actually output the coordinates?
 chrz: System.out.println(X + " " + Y);
 jzen: And it doesn't jump at all?
 Link_jon: mmm. Does the elseif statement to change the cords actually trigger? (Aka are you going to the same place each turn)
 chrz: no it kinda stays on 2/3
 Link_jon: Then... debugging awaits. (Probably start by looking into )
 Link_jon: bombDir(woosps)
 chrz: how to display values in java? If i try to system.out variables it screws up the code
 Dren: system.err.print
 jzen: System.err.println();
 j4at: Link_jon well n in this case is number of characters
 j4at: number of characters of the solution. so N=x**n
 Link_jon: ahh ok

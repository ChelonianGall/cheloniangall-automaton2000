 TheSilent_Boy:&#160;?
 ChrisChrisLoLo: google
 TheSilent_Boy: :joy:
 TheSilent_Boy: bro
 TheSilent_Boy: I meant how to find out my school friends on this website
 gameOverManGameOver: Hello Earth!
 TheSilent_Boy: Hi Aliens&#160;!
 kasudy: anyone coding kutulu?
 TheSilent_Boy: Nope
 TheSilent_Boy: Python here
 Uljahn: xD
 TheSilent_Boy: where did the aliens go??
 TheSilent_Boy: :joy:
 ProCoder3: How many times can we use SHEILD command in CSB
 MadKnight: any
 MadKnight: unlimited
 jrke: as many you want procoder3
 jrke: but we can use boost once in a game
 ProCoder3: Okay thanks:smile:
 MI_coder: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 BotNC: Can anyone recommend any sources to learn JavaScript?
 MI_coder: hey guys someone know if there is a way to close this chatbox from my scree?
 MI_coder: screen*?
 MI_coder: botNC use freecodecamp
 JeffGe: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://javascript.info/">https://javascript.info/</a>
 MI_coder: hey man is there anyway i can hide this chatbox frm my scrn?
 mortadha: hello world
 Uljahn: MI_coder: click triangle on the bottom of the chat
 Uljahn: also it can be disabled with adblock rule or css userstyle
 MI_coder: i cant find a triangle tho
 AwemA: hello 
 AwemA: it's possible to have some help here&#160;? 
 mortadha: also me i need to some help
 mortadha: who can help me
 mortadha:&#160;???
 AwemA: @mortadha , explain your problem, i prefer break my head on something else than what is under my eyes actually ^^
 mortadha: i  have a low level in algorthm 
 mortadha: how i can make my level in algorithm good level
 AwemA: oh, we are in the same boat, and it's for this reason that i'm here , to increase my level , but some topic look so hard for my newbie face&#160;:( 
 mortadha: yes :pensive:
 AwemA: on youtube i think that you can found some good video that explain how solve this pick what fit with your learn way , for it's gaming 
 mortadha: i need to person have a good level to guide me 
 Uljahn: you could use free online courses for learning algorithms and data structures or read some books :smirk:
 mortadha: give me a website can help to learn a basic fo data structures
 mortadha: please
 anantaCodes: Why is shortest mode there? I want to the know the intention behind it
 Lazy_Programmer: I am a student of youtube... Anyone else here from same school?
 Moctrof: anantaCodes, I hated it at first but the goal is to learn new features of your language I think
 Moctrof: But with somelanguages you can't compete, I use python whenever it's shortest and I am a c# guy
 anantaCodes: Yea the learning part if OK. but the platform is meant for competing. How is it a fair competition? Can I choose which types of challenges I can play in a public challege? Not the private ones
 AntiSquid: think clash is meant as a more for fun section
 Saptarshi: anyone on IBM?
 Lazy_Programmer: shortest mode sucks if you are not a python programmer
 Saptarshi: Yup that a word of carat Lazy_programmer
 Lazy_Programmer: I am a c++ guy so I usually skip the shortest mode...
 Saptarshi: thats not the spirit ... whether u win or lose ... u should complete the challenge
 Saptarshi: I'm a C &amp; Java guy
 jrke: even if you are good in c++ so you can get top3 in shortest mode also
 Saptarshi: but I'm always learning python for competitive cuz thats best for these
 prakash218: hello
 prakash218: hi
 jrke: i prefer c++ for complex coding and python for easy and fast coding
 Saptarshi: That's very right jrke
 Saptarshi: even in interviews C/C++ guys are placed above python guys
 Saptarshi: but for competitve I prefer learning up python
 Lazy_Programmer: yeah i know python but i hate string handling stuff, and in shortest mode there are usually string handling challenges...(I hate working with strings cause i found them boring)
 Saptarshi: Yep...
 Saptarshi: Hey lazy programmer whats ur age
 Lazy_Programmer: yeah I am 21... why?
 Saptarshi: and are u working?
 Saptarshi: or studying
 Lazy_Programmer: yeah an internship as a unity game developer
 Lazy_Programmer: also studying
 Saptarshi: Woah that's great
 Saptarshi: btw I'm 16
 Saptarshi: how did u got ur internship at Unity?
 Lazy_Programmer: damn dude I wish I could get to know these competitive programming sites or even programming in that age
 Lazy_Programmer: you are lucky bro really lucky
 jacek: mhm
 Lazy_Programmer: not at unity bro as a unity game developer at a small indie studio
 AntiSquid: i am 12
 Saptarshi: Great!
 Lazy_Programmer: AntiSquid :astonished:
 Saptarshi: ehh AntiSquid might be jocking
 Saptarshi: *joking
 Saptarshi: Hey Lazy_Programmer I found u quite an interesting guy
 Saptarshi: are u on insta?
 Lazy_Programmer: nope I just use linked in (a professional site) and a few competitive programming sites nothing else
 Saptarshi: Oh
 Saptarshi: I would like to keep u in contact..how can I?
 Lazy_Programmer: its okay bro we will meet here again after a week. it was my last day of codingames site I used to be here on thursday and friday tomorrow is for leetcode
 Saptarshi: leetcode's really hard bro.. I could just able to win one contest till now
 starmaq: leetcode is weird 
 Saptarshi: Said right bro
 Saptarshi: Hackerrank's nice
 Lazy_Programmer: not for contest just for practice...
 starmaq: I didn't try it out that much, but there is always a single test case, and in python the solution has to be a method inside of a class
 starmaq: other than that, it's pretty good tbh
 Saptarshi: why dont google develop such sites
 Lazy_Programmer: well leetcode is hard but not weird... because only person with good knowledge of algorithms can survive there
 Lazy_Programmer: saptarshi! google it...
 Lazy_Programmer: that why google is not doing this
 Saptarshi: Can u tell me what did u studied to get such internship at this age
 AntiSquid: use duckduckgo if you too lazy to google
 Lazy_Programmer: wait bro are you making joke of me by saying 'at this age'?
 Saptarshi: No No
 Saptarshi: Im Appreciating bro
 jacek: :thinking:
 Lazy_Programmer: I wanted to get this at age of 19
 Saptarshi: too not such late to have on 21
 Saptarshi: btw
 Saptarshi: leave it
 Saptarshi: just tell me what did u studies
 Saptarshi: *studied
 AntiSquid: i think he considers you to be very successful for your age due to getting an intership at unity Lazy_Programmer
 Lazy_Programmer: by the way I just followed youtube tutorials for one and half year to learn game development and one day I applied for a junior game deve job post on linked in and I got it... boom
 LoukasPap: go duckduckgo
 LoukasPap: google stealing our info
 AntiSquid: and your avatar i guess since you have none
 Lazy_Programmer: let me repeat i am not unity's team member I am doing an intership in a small game dev studio as a unity developer.
 Lazy_Programmer: not in unity
 AntiSquid: well you got him excited about it
 Saptarshi: I have only some pdf assignments given by my school these lockdowns..let google steal it
 Lazy_Programmer: AntiSquid! I don't know when I said that I am working at unity. I said I am working as unity developer somewhere
 Lazy_Programmer: by the way! Saptarshi if you want to work at unity then you have to learn game engine programming
 AntiSquid: sometimes i am speedreading with same comprehension level as Automaton2000
 Saptarshi: how can I convert a String to Integer in C?
 Automaton2000: i end up with a way to do it in a string
 Lazy_Programmer: type casting bro
 Alshock: that one is priceless, well done Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: search for a good reason
 Saptarshi: I know... Like in java we have Integer.valueOf()
 Saptarshi: how can I in C
 Saptarshi: I know i would find in google
 Alshock: strtol I think?
 Alshock: the good ol' way i atoi
 Saptarshi: but it would be kind if someone tells me here
 Uljahn: just find it in google jeez
 Lazy_Programmer: that why I hate strings...:grin:
 Saptarshi: C++++++++++++++++++++++++
 AntiSquid: would be kind for chat people to also read statements for some people, but it doesn't do much really
 Saptarshi: C--
 Saptarshi: AntiSquid++
 Uljahn: would be kind for chat people to not spam
 Saptarshi: spam++
 Saptarshi: sorry
 AntiSquid: no, too late now
 Alshock: ... and to tell whether the answers they're given are what they were looking for
 Lazy_Programmer: Lazy_Programmer.Leave();
 Saptarshi:  Saptarshi.leave();
 AntiSquid: Automaton2000.kick();
 Automaton2000: we have the same issues
 Uljahn: Automaton2000.spam++
 Automaton2000: bitrunner is a little over-performing compared to other games
 jacek: eeyup
 Saptarshi: Automaton2000.spam(while(true));
 Automaton2000: i see you are a pro
 Uljahn: :smile:
 Saptarshi: is this site made with React?
 Saptarshi: I donot code... code codes me
 AntiSquid: it's vue and backbone js
 Doju: C++ really is an entirely different beast to python
 Doju: i've got a decent handle on python but i'm completely lost trying to learn c++
 jacek: do c++ only if you need performance
 Doju: I'm doing c++ because I want to learn it
 Doju: and yeah i guess i need performance
 Doju: i'm writing another bot for the spring challenge
 Doju: this time simming instead of heuristics
 AllYourPawns: jacek whats your bot do for breakthrough? do you use an eval function?
 Uljahn: eval with NN?
 AllYourPawns: ive been trying to do just pure MCTS but feels like its hitting a wall cause it doesnt take into account opponent minimizing score
 AllYourPawns: wondering if there's something better than UCB since UCB is based on normally distributed rewards
 AllYourPawns: which is not true at all for 1v1 games
 jacek: AllYourPawns i use NN for eval
 jacek: the eval is good for alpha-beta, but also MCTS with early playout termination
 jacek: though i use best-first minimax search, which mostly resembles MCTS
 jacek: pure MCTS isnt particularly good for games with many traps
 AllYourPawns: yeah traps mess it up for sure, and okay yeah that makes sense
 Uljahn: i guess Thompson sampling could be better than UCB in that case, no?
 jacek: is this some complicated math? :scream:
 AllYourPawns: haven't heard of that ill look into t hat for sure!
 Doju: I'm really stumped
 Doju: I want to organize all of the inputs into one place
 Doju: maybe a class, maybe a function 
 Doju: anyways i can't do it as a function since you can't return multiple different types
 Doju: so should i actually just return the whole class?
 Doju: this is silly
 Scarfield: you can make a void function with function parameters as references
 Scarfield: void diffTypes(int&amp; bla, float&amp; blu, Pirate&amp; jackSparrow){}
 Doju: right, functions can take multiple different types in but they can't output different types
 Doju: i don't think that really helps though
 Uljahn: can't you use global variables?
 Doju: erm
 Scarfield: no but the "&amp;" makes it a refence, since you are pointing to the address of the parameter
 Scarfield: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y</a> a good tutorial for C++
 Doju: i'll have a watch
 Doju: thanks
 Scarfield: so having Func(int&amp; bla) will apply the changes made to bla within the function outside the function as well
 Doju: yeah i get that
 Scarfield:&#160;:)
 Doju: oh maybe i didn't explain the problem clearly
 Doju: actually i guess that will work with global variables
 Doju: to solve the problem
 jacek: yay for global variables
 jacek: everywhere, everytime
 Doju: nay&#160;:(
 Doju: But i'll try to figure it out, thanks guys
 Saptarshi: pls freakin make me understand * and &amp;
 Saptarshi: what if i write a=7
 Doju: If i understood correctly, pointers are just memory addresses
 Doju: so int a = 7
 Doju: *a_pointer = a
 Doju: then a_pointer is just some address
 Saptarshi: is it like this printf("%x",*ptr);//for addressand printf("%d",ptr);//for value of a?
 DomiKo: *ptr is value
 DomiKo: ptr is memory address
 Saptarshi: ohk thats what im asking for
 Saptarshi: thanks
 jacek: int a = 7; int *b = &amp;a; *b = 5; // a == 5
 DomiKo: and very important
 DomiKo: int* a, b;
 DomiKo: and
 DomiKo: int *a, *b;
 DomiKo: is not the same
 Saptarshi: i know this
 Saptarshi: btw if we do like
 Saptarshi: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/40e1fea5-e164-4ab4-a860-9bd143f17dbc">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/40e1fea5-e164-4ab4-a860-9bd143f17dbc</a>

 Saptarshi: will a change to 7?
 jacek: eeyup
 Saptarshi: that's cool
 Saptarshi: can we do this in java without global vars?
 DomiKo: you know any of Java?
 Doju: so hmm.. I need to give my input handler class, which runs every turn, references to, say, pac instances
 Doju: that seems like a rather fragile way to do it
 Saptarshi: a easier way to do it?
 Saptarshi: *any
 Saptarshi: :regional_indicator_j:
 Saptarshi: A
 Saptarshi: v
 Saptarshi: A
 jacek: kree java!
 pinki: a
 Saptarshi: JAVA, C, C++
 Saptarshi: these are programming langs
 Saptarshi: Python, Ruby, JavaScript
 Saptarshi: these are hamburgers
 Doju: I think I'm gonna be spending a lot of time on this site during the next 6 months
 Saptarshi: anyone aspiring for google?
 Doju: I got the stupid placement of weatherman in the finnish army :d
 Doju: that means i'm gonna be spending every third week in an office with pretty much nothing to do except look at the clouds every now and then and browse the web
 Saptarshi: but are ya aspiring for google
 Saptarshi: and anyone who has became a google assistant dev?
 Doju: not aspiring for google
 Doju: aspiring for spacex but that's not happening since you need to have US citizenship
 Hjax: DomiKo do you have a search in kutulu?
 Hjax: lol the submit button is called Test In Arena now?
 jacek: and they added some checkbox on leaderboard
 Marchete: test in arena?
 Marchete: but, why?
 AntiSquid: actually with working from home already being a thing and it now becoming more popular ... you never know Doju, keep trying
 Marchete: I rather prefer they improve the toolbox instead of these changes or more languages
 Marchete: like NN libraries and more than 100KB
 AntiSquid: replay parser tool 
 AntiSquid: and more support for offline training, option to run "headless" for example without having to fiddle with the code :p
 AntiSquid: well i know we can tweak that ourselves, but why not ...
 jacek: more than 100k characters*
 jacek: and NN guys are already OP
 Marchete: irrelevant
 Marchete: the purpose of the platform is to promote code and AI learning
 jacek: then why there's "compete"
 AntiSquid: more people using NN = more tutorials for using it on CG or NN tuts in general, though most important is to make it easier on CG, MCTS tuts are all over the internet and can be easily adapted to CG
 AntiSquid: also depends on the userbase though
 Hjax: i think proper nn libaries would be pretty interesting 
 jacek: there are some nn tutorials in cg
 AntiSquid: i wouldn't start with those
 jacek: because CSB?
 AntiSquid: if you just want a basic feedforward-backprop then you need to be an acrobat
 AntiSquid: didn't try for CSB because can't setup locally
 AllYourMCTS: is pytorch supported?
 AntiSquid: no
 AllYourMCTS: rip
 AntiSquid: oh and if you change timeout offline you still run into issues
 jacek:&#160;?
 geppoz: i suppose someone is trying to crack ClashOfCode
 geppoz: some user just enters and submits with 0%

 eulerscheZahl: a few more, should update the list...
 Astrobytes: nice&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: so joining clashes to get the list sounds pointless
 geppoz: lol
 geppoz: you published that?
 Astrobytes: It's known site-wide
 geppoz:&#160;:(
 geppoz: so let's hope in people fairness&#160;;)
 Astrobytes: Nah, not like that. For looking up puzzles/clashes if you got stuck or whatever
 Lisker_the_slow: someone come 1v1
 Astrobytes: People will bot, people will cheat sometimes. Most people are fair

 eulerscheZahl: reach lvl29 and you can see the full list
 geppoz: sorry lisker, diner pause, maybe later
 eulerscheZahl: not gonna click that, it will freeze the tab
 Astrobytes: With levelling up comes responsibility and hopefully honesty + integrity prevails
 eulerscheZahl: btw i realized that the way I store data in heroku isn't persistent (updating the database with new entries)&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: actually another user found out as he wanted to build a website with heroku too
 Astrobytes: Ah. Bit of an overhaul needed then
 eulerscheZahl: when the site goes down and up again, the changes are gone
 eulerscheZahl: now the best part, his genious solution :rolling_eyes:
 Astrobytes: That's... not useful
 eulerscheZahl: he found some free cronjob website
 eulerscheZahl: pinging heroku every 15min so it won't go offline
 Astrobytes: ...
 eulerscheZahl: that was my reaction too :D
 eulerscheZahl: it's possible to add a real database to your heroku project. not sure yet if it's free, have to do some readup
 eulerscheZahl: that is: a persistent DB
 Astrobytes: I'm somewhat sure it's not, though was a while ago I checked the T&amp;Cs, maybe they have a free option now
 jacek: whats wrong with that idea? i would ping heroku myself
 AntiSquid: you could host your database separetely on mlab
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://mlab.com/">https://mlab.com/</a> gives plenty space for free for small projects
 AntiSquid: 500mb enough right?
 eulerscheZahl: right now i'm at 72MBand that's mostly codejam results
 AntiSquid: you can create multiple databases, problem is they are each 500mb max
 eulerscheZahl: 500 is more than i need
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab</a>i don't like the red box at the top
 eulerscheZahl: mLab has discontinued the MongoDB add-on. Please migrate to a new MongoDB provider before November 10, 2020.
 AntiSquid: ya got an email about that, didn't fully read it
 AntiSquid: thought they just change owners or something
 Astrobytes: which Heroku data service package are you on eulerscheZahl, the Postgres one?
 eulerscheZahl: yes, just realized that
 eulerscheZahl: SERVICEheroku-postgresqlPLANhobby-dev
 Astrobytes: Hm, bit annoying that you have that updating issue then
 eulerscheZahl: free plan for heroku postgres: Row Limit10,000
 AntiSquid: btw have you tried glitch yet? i stopped using heroku ages ago because of their restrictions
 Astrobytes: Ah
 eulerscheZahl: my codejam table has more than 500k rows
 eulerscheZahl: no. saw it on another project once, never tried myself
 AntiSquid: it's far more simple to use too
 eulerscheZahl: tried pythonanywhere firstthey don't allow to access CG, only whitelisted hosts
 eulerscheZahl: i like heroku actually
 AntiSquid: is mlab only shutting down the heroku addon?

 icecream17: it was about the spring challenge
 jacek: :ie:
 eulerscheZahl: was afkthat chadok.info is from Stilgar t by the way
 PatrickMcGinnisII: eulerscheZahl do you have your own host to play with?
 eulerscheZahl: just the heroku free plan
 eulerscheZahl: nothing where i'm completely free to put on the server whatever i want
 eulerscheZahl: but enough for my needs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Well I would give you my login for flnerd.com, have to stay out of my e-mail tho
 AntiSquid: what is chadok.info&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: thanks for the offer but i don't think i need it
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only way I could really let you manage your own DB
 eulerscheZahl: could afford the few bucks myself. i just lack motivation of setting it up
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i used hostclear, now its justhost...cronjobs,DBs, etc. all infinite
 PatrickMcGinnisII: need just ftp, hit me up

 MadKnight: Automaton2000 how can i beat MadKnight's bot in CSB&#160;?
 Automaton2000: i'm still wondering why it is like a whole new level
 Unkmar: The longer I stay here. The more frustrated I get.
 Unkmar: I knew my simple case for Fair numbering would work but be too slow.
 Unkmar: I wasn't sure how to tackle the longest palindrome. Again, I have something that works but is far too slow.
 Schwase: what language @unkmar?
 Unkmar: JavaScript.
 Schwase: hmmm
 Schwase: maybe C+P your code to me in a private message?
 Unkmar: I'm not using discord, so I'm not sure how.
 Unkmar: Nevermind.
 Schwase: you can click my name
 Unkmar: Won't help much right now anyway. I have completely broken code.
 Schwase: well
 Schwase: what is your approach?
 Unkmar: Well, the too slow approach to Fair numbering is, counting digits to each page into an array, finding half, then finding that page location in the array.
 Schwase: yes that would be too slow
 Schwase: but there is another way to get how many numbers are in a specific interval of page numbers
 Schwase: too be more specific, how many digits
 Unkmar: Yeah, 9 times per level. Assuming a complete level.
 Unkmar: Actually, 9 * 10^level
 Schwase: thats how many pages there are
 Schwase: how many digits are there
 Schwase: on level 1 theres 2 digits per page right?
 Schwase: so itd be (level+1)*9*10^level
 Unkmar: I keep trying to avoid musing Math.log(), but I know that is a much easier method.
 Schwase: it is usefl

 Unkmar: yeah, but log() is expensive if you can get away with just checking length of a casted string.

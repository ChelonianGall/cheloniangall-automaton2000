 MSmits: mmh I wonder if I will need to use zobrist now. My endgame solver for D&amp;B is working but it takes 75 seconds to solve 100 endgames. Some really fast, some really slow

 TheSilent_Boy: any one clasher?
 MSmits: dont spam C&amp;C invites
 MSmits: coc i mean
 TheSilent_Boy: ok
 TheSilent_Boy: I was just inviting
 jrke: silent boy #clash click on this 
 TheSilent_Boy: not spammoing&#160;:)
 jrke: whats zobsrist MSmits
 MSmits: it's just a way to generate a hash used for transposition tables
 MSmits: I am thinking of how to do that for this graph gamestate
 MSmits: it will also be the first time I succesfully combine ab with transpositions. I did either of them separately, but not combined. That's a bit complicated
 Marchete: what kind of TT?
 Marchete: by edges?
 MSmits: Yeah I think so
 MSmits: I think I might just use the bitboard for it
 MSmits: if I have a bitboard-code assigned to each edge, i can remove it when   i play the edge
 MSmits: should be unique
 Marchete: After working with graphs, I maybe revisit some bit based game representation
 MSmits: xor that with the score of course
 MSmits: what do you mean exactly Marchete
 Marchete: using bitboards
 MSmits: ahh ok. It works nicely in D&amp;B, but for the endgame solver it was too messy
 Marchete: I have mixed feelings about combining score
 MSmits: what do you mean combining score?
 Marchete: "xor that with the score of course"
 MSmits: hmm, i guess i could do unscored states
 MSmits: I did that for the wood-2 solver
 MSmits: (I solved wood-2)
 Marchete: if you can solve any endgame
 Marchete: in reality is a difScore
 Marchete: it works any direction
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 MSmits: but what if you do ab pruning
 TheSilent_Boy: hi
 MSmits: wont this cause problems? If you cut off the branch early?
 MSmits: you never got the exact score
 MSmits: just a lower/upperbound
 Marchete: why not MCTS? just curious
 MSmits: oh the plan is still to use MCTS, assuming I can get this solver to be fast
 MSmits: it's supposed to go at the end of the rollout
 Marchete: solver of "non simple" endgames?
 MSmits: yeah i got it working
 MSmits: but it;s still slow
 MSmits: lacks some heuristics and has no TT
 MSmits: I discovered some new things too
 Marchete: what things
 MSmits: I thought it was always better to play 1 and 2 chains first
 MSmits: but it's not
 MSmits: if you have a 3 split and one of them is a 2 chain
 MSmits: you can play it first and have 1 extra 1/2 chain to change control
 MSmits: or play a different chain on the split and eliminate the 2 chain entirely
 MSmits: meaning the parity of control changed
 MSmits: that turns the entire game around
 Marchete: I don't know any theorem or corollary about 3 way solvers
 Marchete: all are 2 way
 MSmits: you mean you dont know any theorem using splits/joins&#160;?
 Marchete: I only read about effective length of subchains on a chain with a 3-way box
 MSmits: I didn't find any either so that checks out
 MSmits: but my bot just tries all combinations on splits currently
 MSmits: my solver i mean
 MSmits: this is why transpositions should help a lot
 MSmits: the order often doesnt matter if you have separate splits doing things
 Marchete: and border edges must be treated differently
 MSmits: they call them "ground" sometimes in the paper
 MSmits: basically dead ends right?
 Marchete: like A1B and A1L are equivalent
 MSmits: oh you mean before the end game?
 Marchete: they shouldn't make a different gamestate
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: for TT and stuff
 MSmits: mmh not sure if thats worth bothering with in a live bot. I would fix that in a meta mcts though
 MSmits: you can also do symmetry and such
 MSmits: usually very expensive
 Marchete: I don't think naive symmetry work here
 MSmits: why not?
 Marchete: I think graph symmetry (or equivalence) is better
 MSmits: true, but that's really really complicated
 MSmits: isn't it?
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: but an example is what I said
 MSmits: I am doing something like that in the end game solver already
 MSmits: but mostly from the bitboard
 MSmits: i count chains
 MSmits: and loops
 MSmits: simple isolated ones i mean
 MSmits: the order they are played are mostly fixed
 Marchete: I'm still testing board representations
 MSmits: never play a larger chain before a smaller one and never play a larger loop either
 Marchete: I haven't find a one comfortable and fast enough
 MSmits: never play a chain of size &gt;= 4 before any loop
 MSmits: those things make your solver a lot faster
 MSmits: but this only works on simple objects, not on splits
 MSmits: so i treat them separately
 MSmits: they are not even part of the graph
 MSmits: so far the hardest thing was the merging of edges for joins that go below 3 edges (they disappear)
 MSmits: so I have a system of edges and joins that deactivate and reactivate as the graph is played
 MSmits: as you said, it's not that easy in C++
 MSmits: got stuck for many hrs until i figured out that the reconnection of joins needs to be in reverse order, last first
 MSmits: for the undo  i mean
 Marchete: I won't undo
 Marchete: too hard
 MSmits: hmm because it's mcts?
 Marchete: I just go forward, copying all
 MSmits: you just reset?
 Marchete: yes
 MSmits: for minimax you kinda have to 
 MSmits: can't copy the entire graph every time, or at least, that seems painful
 Marchete: it depends if copying the object is faster than undoing it
 MSmits: yeah I am not sure actually
 MSmits: the object is actually not that big
 Marchete: maybe storing each GameState on the MCTS node?
 MSmits: I already did that for wood-2
 MSmits: it's just two uint64_t for bitboards
 Marchete: that could save some CPU time
 Marchete: well
 MSmits: but that's for mcts
 Marchete: my idea of GameState is not that simple
 Marchete: so it will be big
 MSmits: i know, mine isn't either, for the end game solver
 MSmits: it's really two separate searches
 Marchete: I need a clear description of what endgame solver is for you
 MSmits: ok, so, you play the game until only loony moves are left (every move gives away boxes)
 Marchete: I refer endgame as a heuristic solvable game (with degrees &lt;=2)
 MSmits: at that point it's an endgame for me
 MSmits: usually around ply 55
 MSmits: halfway
 MSmits: cant be further in than ply 61 or so i think
 MSmits: depend son how many border edges were played
 MSmits: around 0,3% of those are heuristically solvable
 Marchete: so you plan to change to graph mode there, no?
 MSmits: the rest needs minimax
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: i convert at this point
 Marchete: ah, I start with 1 massive chain that can be splitted on each move
 Marchete: so the GameState is big
 MSmits: by chain you mean a graph with each node 4 connected except borders and corners?
 Marchete: chain == floodfill from a box
 MSmits: ahh for me a chain is a string of boxes with 2 connections each
 Marchete: I need another new chain if I have boxes not in that floodfill
 Marchete: well, not a chain tbt
 MSmits: right
 MSmits: I do this floodfill thing to identify all the simple objects and generate the graph
 Marchete: a structure that can be defined as chain later
 Marchete: my chain will keep track of boxes by its degrees
 MSmits: it sure sounds interesting. Basically, you start from the beginning of the game and I start from the end
 Marchete: degrees == edge count
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: for me a chain is a loop is minDegree == maxDegree == 2 and not grounded
 Marchete: if*
 Marchete: for example
 MSmits: to find an isolated loop I do
 MSmits: uint64_t twoBoxes = ~fullBoxes &amp; ~emptyBoxes &amp; ~xorBoxes &amp; FULL_BOARD;
 MSmits: to get all boxes with 2 connections
 MSmits: then i check if that covers my simple object and it doesnt have other types of boxes
 MSmits: if it doesn't, it's a loop
 Marchete: I imagine that's better :D
 MSmits: well it depends on how often you do it of course
 MSmits: if yours is incremental, it might be better
 Marchete: at each turn basically
 MSmits: hard to say
 MSmits: in my case I have to do the entire process every time i hit an endgame
 MSmits: and with multiple rollouts that is a lot
 Marchete: I do everytime I create a new chain (I think&#160;:) )
 MSmits: i guess the solver is the main bottleneck in my case
 MSmits: some endgames still take multiple seconds
 Marchete: but how it works?
 MSmits: well
 Marchete: it's not like applying theorems?
 MSmits: for simple objects I have some heuristics
 MSmits: so for isolated chains, smallest first
 MSmits: thats a theorem
 MSmits: for isolated loops, smallest first
 MSmits: loops before all chains except shorter than 4
 MSmits: for complicated objects I just play the edges in any order, as part of the negamax
 MSmits: so my choices are:
 MSmits: play shortest loop
 MSmits: play shortest chain
 MSmits: play any complex edge
 MSmits: I could add some more I think, did not yet include every theorem
 MSmits: but I have to make sure the simple object rules still work in a non-simple endgame
 MSmits: for some rules that is obviously true
 MSmits: but others.. not so sure
 MSmits: for example, you can be 100% sure it's never a good idea to play a longer chain if a shorter one is available, not even if there's tons of other complex stuff around
 MSmits: it's just never a good idea
 MSmits: same for loops
 Marchete: why play shortest loop before a complex one?
 Marchete: complex I imagine 3-way ones
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: thats not what i said
 MSmits: a shorter loop for a longer loop, both isolated
 MSmits: the complex edges can be played any time, in any order, before any simple ones, or after any simple ones
 Marchete: my idea of MCTS was to try to reduce any game to a 2-degree endgame, and get a difScore from there
 Marchete: so except "free" moves that I can autoplay
 Marchete: that was my future idea
 MSmits: my problem with that approach though, is that the 2 degree endgame might happen at ply 100
 Marchete: free moves as 2 boxes like: O-O
 Marchete: you kno0w
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: always play those
 MSmits: or your opponent will
 MSmits: costing him nothing
 Marchete: in fact I plan to just play it automatically, and add the score
 MSmits: yeah, for my wood-2 solver, every turn was actually a whole turn, not a move
 Marchete: reduces the deep
 Marchete: depth
 MSmits: it does
 MSmits: did you hear how my wood-2 solver failed to get into wood-2 even when it played perfectly?
 Marchete: I find that game more interesting than other board games
 MSmits: into wood-1 i mean
 Marchete: It's hard to have any opening book
 MSmits: i do too, so far
 MSmits: hmm, depends on the others
 Marchete: and it's more about board representation
 Marchete: and what it means
 Marchete: not isolated edges
 MSmits: if the other players play deterministically, opening books will always work
 Marchete: any simple minimax AI using edges won't do sh*t
 MSmits: true

 MSmits: you can see the variation in end game solve time
 Marchete: nega value = 4 time = 47717230 microseconds
 jacek: drum&amp;bass eh?
 MSmits: Marchete yeah, many joins and edges in the endgame
 MSmits: transpositions hopefully fixes that
 MSmits: jacek yes&#160;:)
 jrke:  7994787 microseconds
 jrke: thats huge
 jacek: thats only 2.53344924 × 10-7 years
 MSmits: it is, but maybe it could be the squareroot of that or something
 MSmits: with improvements
 Thiesjoo: MSmits, what bot do you have online now?
 MSmits: hi Thiesjoo, a random bot with some heuristics for capturing boxes
 MSmits: it plays poorly in the endgame
 jrke: what will be future bot&#160;?
 MSmits: just grabs whatever box it can
 Thiesjoo: Ah okay, that's why i'm beating it
 MSmits: yes&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo:&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: Thanks!
 Marchete: my bot is a boost for yours, 100% winrate, 100% of the time
 MSmits: I showed the game to Thiesjoo in class and 2 days later he has a bot in wood 1
 MSmits: Marchete nice&#160;:)
 DomiKo: that's cool
 jacek: hes your student? and hes above you?
 jrke: domiko you have some timeouts i think 
 MSmits: yes jacek :P
 Thiesjoo: Yup
 inoryy: wow
 jrke: who is your student ms?
 MSmits: Thiesjoo
 DomiKo: jrke that could be true
 inoryy: so tell us what is MSmits like as a teacher
 MSmits: should I go offfline for this :P
 Thiesjoo: Maybe&#160;:)
 DomiKo: :joy:
 jrke: :smiley:
 Thiesjoo: Jk, he's a good teacher. Good at explaing complex subjects
 MSmits: thanks
 inoryy:&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: Don't have him for a lot of subjects this year&#160;:( Kinda miss him 
 MSmits: I mostly taught Thiesjoo physics though, only just started CS with him
 MSmits: he has a different physics teacher this year
 inoryy: oh, you teach CS as well now?
 MSmits: yeah, last year to, only 4 classes a week though
 MSmits: I still teach physics more
 MSmits: I am studying for CS teaching degree
 inoryy: ah actually I now vaguely remember you telling about that
 MSmits: should be done at the end of the schoolyear
 inoryy: nice
 MSmits: it's fun. Currently I am teaching some of the  "softer" CS subjects, that's new for me
 MSmits: so far it's all been programming
 inoryy: TAing was probably the hardest thing I did in life :D
 MSmits: TA?
 Thiesjoo: When are we learning x86 assembely?&#160;:)
 MSmits: lol, that is actually an optional CS domain Thiesjoo, we don't teach that unfortunately
 Thiesjoo:&#160;:(
 inoryy: teaching assistant, like hold seminars and practicals in tandem with prof's lectures
 Thiesjoo: Are we going to learn some programming this year?
 inoryy: which ended up having to duplicate lectures since half the class skips lectures...
 MSmits: Thiesjoo plenty, but not at first
 MSmits: we do human computer interaction, app development ( I guess some programming there) then after that it's mostly AI
 MSmits: inoryy that is annoying
 Thiesjoo: But app development is in app inventor correct?
 MSmits: I think so yes: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/">https://appinventor.mit.edu/</a>
 MSmits: we do that for a few weeks
 jrke: my psychic's is also good&#160;:)
 MSmits: all new for me as well
 MSmits: jrke you read minds?
 jrke: i read future&#160;;)
 MSmits: Thiesjoo have you worked with app inventor?
 Thiesjoo: Yup, in 4vwo I used it to make an app for NLT
 DomiKo: jrke thanks i had boardSize=2 not 7 in one place
 MSmits: what did you think of it?
 Thiesjoo: The programming part is just scratch so that was boring
 jrke:&#160;:)
 Thiesjoo: But I think it's good for beginners
 MSmits: ah you mean it looks like scratch?
 Thiesjoo: Yup
 MSmits: there are several graphical languages 
 MSmits: they all look sort of the same
 jrke: 3 ongoing submission in D&amp;B
 MSmits: often you can directly code JS or python 
 MSmits: because the graphical stuff is translated to that
 MSmits: perhaps there is a possibility for you to do that
 Thiesjoo: We'll see
 eulerscheZahl: "there are several graphical languages they all look sort of the same"
 MSmits: hi euler&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: hi
 Thiesjoo: WOW, that looks cool
 MSmits: I was more referring to this: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://makecode.microbit.org/">https://makecode.microbit.org/</a>
 jrke: bye euler im going :stuck_out_tongue:
 Thiesjoo: Oh microbit's. Those were fun
 MSmits: Did you do microbit in 2nd/3rd year Thiesjoo?
 Thiesjoo: Yes
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: a colleague asked me to write a prime number calculator in make code
 MSmits: was pretty easy, took me 10 minutes. 
 jacek: i would only do even prime numbers
 MSmits: nice&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: we have a prime puzzle here on CG too (shameless advertising)
 jacek: the other half of work should be done by someone else
 MSmits: i will remember that one jacek
 jacek: :3
 MSmits: allright, down to 12,5 seconds from 75 seconds, nice improvement&#160;:)
 MSmits: I added the simple game solver into my negamax to calculate the rest of the game as soon as all the complex edges are gone
 MSmits: only disconnected and reconnected 123 million edges instead of 500 million now&#160;:)
 MSmits: slowest game still takes 6 seconds though
 TheSilent_Boy: Any one who plays Clash of Clans here?
 MSmits: I think maybe google messed up on you
 MSmits: we only have clash of code

 TheSilent_Boy: :grin:
 eulerscheZahl: smits usually needs a week or 2 to get his bot ready
 Thiesjoo: Yes he told me
 TheSilent_Boy: :nerd:
 eulerscheZahl: but then he beats me hard. at least on board games
 TheSilent_Boy: Sounds amazing
 TheSilent_Boy: :grin:
 TheSilent_Boy: well

 psychopath: Hi everybodyI'm using Windows 10 and python 3.7 and try to install a package called pie-extended with pip install pie-extended, but it fails building wheels for lxml which is a required package for pie-extended (given that lxml 4.5.2 is correctely installed on my computer but pie-extended requires 4.2.1). I should install libxml2 and libxslt but I don't manage to. Any idea?
 psychopath: Bonjour tout le monde. Je suis sous Windows 10 et python 3.7 et j'essaye d'installer le package pie-extended via la commande pip install pie-extended, mais ça ne marche pas au moment de construire  les dépendances de lxml, sachant que lxml 4.5.2 est installé correctement sur mon PC mais que pie-extended requiert la version 4.2.1. Je devrais installer libxml2 et libxslt mais je n'y parviens pas sous windows. Une idée?
 eulerscheZahl: you could create a virtual env and install it there with the version of libxml that you need

 kevin1_1andrew: hi
 MSmits: hi
 Thiesjoo: And which algorithm are you currently using?
 Thiesjoo: Minimax?
 jacek: *yawn*
 MSmits: Thiesjoo yeah
 MSmits: well negamax, but thats the same
 Thiesjoo: Cool, still need to work on my minimax implementation
 Thiesjoo: It is very, very, very slow
 jacek: no wonder, its javascript :v
 MSmits: If you really want to get into D&amp;B you need to read some scientific papers
 Thiesjoo: Already found a few to read
 Thiesjoo: Very interesting!
 MSmits: oh right, js is definitely not optimal
 Thiesjoo: That's also true
 MSmits: if you don't know c++ at all, you might consider learning Rust
 MSmits: same speed but more coder-friendly
 MSmits: as i understand
 Thiesjoo: Seems cool
 Thiesjoo: Will look into it
 jacek: you recommend rust!? i thought you were my brother
 Thiesjoo: :joy:
 MSmits: well c++ is horrible,  I only use it cuz I know C# and the syntax was similar... and of course it is fast

 jacek: so clashy
 starmaq: I was interested in both C++ and C because they're really interesting languages
 starmaq: especially the notion of pointers 
 starmaq: and I guess C++ is just a "more features" version of C
 starmaq: with slight changes in previous features
 starmaq: lots of big softwares (might even say almost all of the ones I know) use C++, not sure why that choice
 jacek: i onlu use c++ for performance, in here. havent use C/C++ in work ever

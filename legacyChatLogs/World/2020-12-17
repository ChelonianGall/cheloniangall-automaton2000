 mzbear: wtf is with the turn count in code a la mode ... 600 turns total with 50ms each, that's maximum of 30 seconds per match :O
 eulerscheZahl: which is the max duration that CG allows
 eulerscheZahl: on RAIC i saw 12min per match
 mzbear: oh dear
 mzbear: meanwhile, that bitfield thing you helped me with yesterday, ... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://paste.ofcode.org/AQNWhUuF8bzJSuMpCnYLtW">https://paste.ofcode.org/AQNWhUuF8bzJSuMpCnYLtW</a>
 mzbear: i'm having a feeling there's an even better way to do this, but it eludes me
 mzbear: ... but i already finished that puzzle, so perhaps i shouldn't bother with it
 mzbear: oh, right, i could just make two loops and store the results in an array .. do upper triangle and lower triangle separately
 mzbear: every once in a while i need to split a string in standard c++ code, and it makes me cry.  c++20 seems to finally have string splitting out of the box via the ranges library
 Robin_Hood: hello
 Robin_Hood: hii
 MSmits: makes me cry too mzbear
 MSmits: :cry:
 MSmits: it's what kept me from using c++ in contests for a while
 MSmits: well one of the reasons
 mzbear: didn't test, but apparently this is valid c++20:  for (auto token&#160;: str | std::views::split(' ')) { /* it's christmas time */ }
 mzbear: so you can basically make pipes that filter and transform things
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: i just want it to split my openingbook
 MSmits: so far i used some unreadable code for it i found somewhere using google
 MSmits: it's crazy how hard it is to just split a string into characters
 mzbear: using stringstreams and std::getline is kinda okayish, but annoying nevertheless
 MSmits: I probably would have much preferred rust or some other modern fast language
 MSmits: but i already learned c++ and dont fancy learning another
 mzbear: rust is a great language, but super annoying for prototyping anything
 Wanwws: i can't understand coding 
 mzbear: it forces you to be quite specific about lifetimes and ownership in a way that clashes with how i've learned to code
 Wanwws: help me please
 Wanwws: mime type code
 mzbear: every time i've ported any c++ code of mine into rust, i've found hidden bugs in the code because they're compilation errors in rust...
 MSmits: you take this one mzbear, I need to finish my class  :P
 mzbear: wanwws, what's the issue?
 Uljahn: 99% of newbs: my code fails because of bugged testcases
 SupSon: Is there some doc on how to run a local tournament with local instances for a game?
 mzbear: supson, I still haven't gotten to set up any local games myself, but i found this when i was looking into it earlier: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester">https://github.com/dreignier/cg-brutaltester</a>

 coldcodehah: Good Good afternoon
 Proprogramer: morning for me
 coldcodehah: hah
 kurtesy: Good Night
 coldcodehah: where night
 coldcodehah: Japan?
 MadKnight: not in philadelphia for sure
 coldcodehah: Coding 《Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1》
 MadKnight: okay
 MadKnight: i like your 《
 MadKnight: AutomatonNN u gotta learn to use those
 AutomatonNN: first the contest comes out
 coldcodehah: 《Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1》 complete
 MadKnight: WOW
 MadKnight: jj
 MadKnight: oh wait i mean
 MadKnight: гг
 MadKnight: Automaton2000 u gotta be proud
 Automaton2000: how're u gonna do the same for the rest of the game
 MadKnight: u can't keep doing the same thing Automaton2000 it just gets old at some point
 Automaton2000: guess i should do that
 MadKnight: u can't keep talking to Automaton2000 forever Automaton2000 it just gets old at some point
 Automaton2000: seems like a fun game
 MadKnight: hmm u right Automaton2000 it will never get old
 Automaton2000: should have thought of that as well
 coldcodehah: Coding &lt;Shadows of the Knight - Episode 2&gt;
 MadKnight: are u a bot
 coldcodehah: error Timeout
 coldcodehah: :joy:
 MadKnight: wur
 MadKnight: wut
 MadKnight: what is that supposed to mean
 coldcodehah: not bot
 MadKnight: then why are u saying those things
 coldcodehah: practice typing
 MadKnight: coding &lt;&lt; ctrlv &gt;&gt; what a nice practice, Automaton2000!
 Automaton2000: not as much as you want to compare the two
 coldcodehah: u are right
 MadKnight: aren't u already practicing typing in coding&#160;?
 MadKnight: Kirbiby
 MadKnight: no #fr Kirbiby
 MadKnight: are u also here Kirbiby&#160;?
 Kirbiby: I'm everywhere
 MadKnight: oh cool so i can ping u anywhere
 MadKnight: anyway
 MadKnight: what are u doing Kirbiby that u talked about on #fr&#160;?
 Kirbiby: AoC17
 MadKnight: what is that
 Kirbiby: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">https://adventofcode.com/2020/</a>
 MadKnight: oh cool
 MadKnight: so what's your strat&#160;?
 MadKnight: are u doing it in c++ Kirbiby&#160;?
 Kirbiby: it depends the day
 Kirbiby: it depends on the day
 MadKnight: what is today&#160;?
 MadKnight: what is it today&#160;?
 Kirbiby: clik on it and you see
 Kirbiby: today the input is not a pain to parse so it's C++ day
 MadKnight: oh it's a weird random "thing"
 MadKnight: what do u mean by pain to parse&#160;?
 MadKnight: what is a pain to parse only in c++&#160;?
 MadKnight: Kirbiby
 MadKnight: stop disappearing in #fr
 Kirbiby: comma separated string for instance
 MadKnight: wut
 MadKnight: u can just split that
 MadKnight: u can just getline(std, separator)
 MadKnight: did u not know getline got an external argument for that&#160;?
 MadKnight: extra i mean
 MadKnight: not external
 Kirbiby: not it's shitty
 MadKnight: u can just do getline(cin, ',')
 MadKnight: just make a function for that
 MadKnight: and just ctrlc ctrlv this function into every single project
 MadKnight: so that u can use it like it's always there
 Kirbiby: in ruby I do $&lt;.map{|k|k.split(","}.map(&amp;:to_i)} and I'm done
 MadKnight: just make a function for that 
 MadKnight: cmon
 MadKnight: it'll be readintarray() in both c++ and ruby
 MadKnight: c++ is so painful cuz everyone tries to optimize it as much as possible to win any amounts of ticks
 MadKnight: just make a wrapper for stuff and just ctrlc ctrlv the entire thing at once
 Kirbiby: don't worry, you don't have to convince me
 MadKnight: no i have to
 MadKnight: i've been paid 
 Kirbiby: I love C++, but sometimes I just want to parse the input in 20 characters
 MadKnight: by Automaton2000 ofc
 Automaton2000: you can use it, but it doesn't seem to be a good idea in the long term
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000 that is not the time to respond
 Automaton2000: when you try to use the chat for the first turn of the game
 MadKnight: no Automaton2000 i said quiet
 Automaton2000: how many players pass to legend
 MadKnight: bad Automaton2000 
 Automaton2000: not sure if i can figure it out
 MadKnight: Kirbiby i just have an #include that gets all my stuff into the project
 MadKnight: so i can parse the inputs in 20 chars in c++ too
 Kirbiby: yeah, I don't
 MadKnight: just fix it once Kirbiby and then u can do all the stuff in c++ painlessly
 MadKnight: that deserves a big cmon
 MadKnight: that will help u go further
 MadKnight: u will be even able to do big things like i did - for exactly, an absolutely universal BFS
 MadKnight: so i can now do pathfinding the optimal way in any project
 MadKnight: and it doesn't look terrible
 MadKnight: and is not a pain
 MadKnight: Kirbiby
 Kirbiby: Yes, if I was not so lazy
 MadKnight: i can just lead u
 MadKnight: i know how it's done it will only take like 5min
 MadKnight: let's do it kirb
 MadKnight: Kirbiby
 MadKnight: *i can just lead u through it
 MadKnight: u won't have to think hard Kirbiby
 Maxim251: Its posible to include file in game from disk?
 Hussein4K: guys

 AI_says_hi: What are you working on?
 beingsalman: Hi
 mzbear: Kirbiby, c++20 to the rescue!  for (auto token&#160;: str | std::views::split(',')) {}
 mzbear: or if you wanted them as integers, str | std::views::split(',') | std::views::transform(atoi) ... should work, i think
 mzbear: oh, c++11 already introduced stoi()
 mzbear: i almost never parse strings in c++ either :D

 MSmits: on the forum
 tarikyildiz: Hi how important is math and algorithm for programming
 ryantimjohn: important
 tarikyildiz: So how can I learn? Will I learn math and algorithm only for python or everything?
 darkhorse64: math and algorithms are not tied to a specific language
 hanzexi: Hi, guys. How are you doing?
 VizGhar: MSmits thanks :thumbsup:
 tarikyildiz: Thanks  
 tarikyildiz: I know almost all the code in Python, but I felt like something was missing, what was missing is algorithm and logic
 tarikyildiz: thank you very much everyone
 tarikyildiz: Well we have to learn algorithms for puzzles and competitions on this site sounds very complicated questions
 tarikyildiz: I will try to learn algorithm
 tarikyildiz: See you
 Q12: What does it - "E128 continuation line under-indented for visual indent" means?
 Uljahn: i guess you should add more indentation to the line to match some part of the previous line

 VizGhar: I've finally managed to implement "possible moves" in UTTT (took me like 2 hours). Now scoring and MCTS
 VizGhar: this is something i was able to do in 30 minutes back then :P
 jacek: noice
 jacek: keep in mind in CG, if no one has 3-in-row in main board, the one with most won small boards wins, unlike the normal UTTT rules
 VizGhar: yeah. I've read that and watched a few replays...
 struct: I wonder if its worth to send the states back, from depth 4 to depth 3 once the move is done, this is what it normally looks like
 struct: States / Score / Move / Time: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6cff6c07-273d-4542-808b-d0f3e8bdcd55">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6cff6c07-273d-4542-808b-d0f3e8bdcd55</a>
 VizGhar: I also challenged myself and trying it with C++ (I'm android dev so Kotlin is my default)
 struct: Not sure its worth just to shave 1ms
 VizGhar: What's that struct?
 struct: From STC
 struct: I try all the moves until depth N
 struct: in that case 4
 struct: I could save a little time on next turn and choose the Depth 3 from the depth 4 of the previous turn
 struct: same from depth 2 and 1
 struct: But just to save 1 ms, is probably not worth
 VizGhar: (hope you are not waiting for my approval :D)
 struct: Guess Ill do something else and leave this for later
 Astrobytes: just a struc t braindump, don't worry&#160;;)
 struct: Yeah, I like to share my progress
 struct: Very rarely I reach depth 8 if board is almost full
 struct: But by then its too late to win
 struct: Still I can do perfect move sthen
 jacek: endtables?
 struct: not endtables
 struct: because the game might not end in that depth
 struct: Also is very rare to get depth 8
 struct: Only if I have 4.7 moves average over 8 depth
 struct: Which is very rare, since the least amount of moves you have is 2 if both stones have different colors
 MSmits: this uttt rule where the player with the most boards wins in the CG version is actually the rule that makes it solved for player 1 as win I suspect
 MSmits: because player 2 can block 3 in a row, but not at the same time get as many won boards
 MSmits: it's basically just an extra way to win for the player who has advantage
 MSmits: played a couple games without this rule on some websites and it was pretty easy to draw as p2
 struct: How much would game change
 struct: if there was swap rule?
 MSmits: fundamentaly
 MSmits: +l
 MSmits: it would probably be solved as a draw then as i suspect yavalath is
 MSmits: and it would be very balanced
 MSmits: right now it's quite boring at top level play unless you're like me
 struct: Not much to improve on?
 MSmits: It took me just a few days to make a bot that wins vs kar liso as p1, 100% of the time and he doesnt even use an opening book
 MSmits: thats because the better your bot is the more narrow your line of play and his bot is very good
 MSmits: mind you this does not work all that well vs tomatoes, but i suspect it still does if i take the time
 struct: So you changed stuff besides book?
 karliso: interesting
 MSmits: nah, but i am working on that. I do like to be able to say i have the best bot and i currently dont
 MSmits: hi&#160;:)
 MSmits: I studied your rollout karliso, thanks for sharing that
 MSmits: i noticed you have a lookup table for picking the mainboard
 MSmits: on free moves
 MSmits: that seems important
 karliso: hi&#160;:)
 karliso: oh yes
 karliso: You mean a differen lookup table..
 MSmits: i was guessing it prefers important boards where 3 in a row is still possible
 MSmits: since you also pass your own mainboard
 MSmits: as opposed to just the whole thing
 MSmits: or maybe some preference to middle board if it can
 karliso: Probably, I don't rememebr exactly. Also maybe 4 more likely than others?!
 MSmits: there could be some weighted random in there that you tweaked
 MSmits: isnt this a huge table?
 MSmits: i wonder if this gives you cache problems
 MSmits: because its [myboard][mainboard][random]
 karliso: My bot is very well memory-optimized.
 MSmits: yeah but 18 bit * whatever the size of the random part is
 MSmits: thats a lot
 karliso: Random is not big.
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: preference for winning miniboards was interesting
 MSmits: i always had block + win as equal value and randomed between them
 MSmits: seemed better than win, but maybe i didnt test it well enough
 karliso: idk, I have not even tested other way.
 struct: karlis o should do Yavalath, so you have more competition&#160;:)
 MSmits: its weird, you do realize a lot of players have experimented so much and you just try this way and win with it&#160;:)
 karliso: I have tried many things, but not block/win as equal.
 MSmits: ohh ok
 MSmits: well its nice because you dont need to distinguish p1 and p2
 MSmits: it uses the same array
 MSmits: because block for one, is win for the other
 MSmits: well i suppose it might be different for you, i use a ternary lookup
 MSmits: still wondering if i should not just go back to binary
 MSmits: ternary gives you a smaller array, but slower computations
 karliso: yeah, I never tried ternary as I always felt that binary is going to be faster
 MSmits: it is, but it depends on how many lookups you do
 MSmits: you do "compute winning moves"
 MSmits: I look that sort of stuff up
 karliso: These are frequent lookups so they should be in cache.
 MSmits: probably i should look again in how to do that fast, when i first wrote the bot i wasnt really good at bit tricks
 MSmits: oh but your compute winning moves is not a lookup is it&gt;
 MSmits: i think you do a calculation
 karliso: It is a lookup.
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: couldnt you make the function prettier btw? With the if/else structure for the two players?
 MSmits: seems very symmetric
 MSmits: except you count a draw for p1 as a loss somehow
 MSmits: the mewhite? thingy
 MSmits: i heard this before
 MSmits: people doing this
 karliso: There is often a tradeoff between pretty code and performance.
 MSmits: yeah I guess so
 karliso: This code is written to be fast.
 MSmits: what is UTTT:ENDGAME7 btw?
 Skynse: Finished my exams today
 Skynse: I can code all I want now
 MSmits: grats Skynse, hope you passed
 MACKEYTH: I think that's out of date, karliso
 Skynse: So far I'm doing great, thanks
 MACKEYTH: Modern compilers are hella slick. You're better off writing for legibility
 MSmits: well what you can do is, try to prettify it, then just profile
 MSmits: if its just as fast, keep it
 Skynse: How do I make the chat stay on "World" when opening new codingame pages?
 MSmits: no idea
 karliso: idk if I want to explain ENDGAME7
 MSmits: then dont 
 MSmits: always keep stuff to yourself if you think it is important
 MSmits: I havent shared some stuff also
 MSmits: that made my bot a lot stronger
 karliso: I put my uttt code in gitbolt and examined generated assembly.
 MSmits: nice
 MSmits: i think mostly you are good at these multis and contests because your intuition is good btw. I mean performance helps, but it;s not that big of a deal
 MSmits: uttt is kind of an exception in this regard, performance helps more for this game than for other
 MSmits: but still other things are more important i think
 MSmits: choosing what moves to prefer, what to prune, what to evaluate etc.
 SupSon: how many rollouts do you get 3rd ply
 SupSon: for uttt
 QuiqueLuna: Hola Amigos
 Skynse: Hola mi Amigo, tu hablo anglais?
 MSmits: that that much currently, only like 90k, but i do some stuff that makes the rollouts heavier
 MSmits: but before i had 130k or so
 ElJona174: Hola a todos
 SupSon: wow that's crazy
 SupSon: i'm only getting like 60k
 ElJona174: Algún consejo?
 MSmits: karliso and recurse both have near 200k
 SupSon: do they do full rollouts
 MSmits: you mean every child?
 MSmits: a sim
 SupSon: i mean for the sim
 SupSon: do they play for the end
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: there's a thing some players do where they rollout from ever child on expansion
 MSmits: so thats like 7-8 sims after expansion
 SupSon: ah ok
 MSmits: i dont do this
 MSmits: I *think* karliso does this
 MSmits: but recurse doesnt
 MSmits: hes got about 180k
 SupSon: you use solver extension right?
 MSmits: yeah
 SupSon: do you propagate proven draws
 SupSon: or only wins and losses
 MSmits: i do draws also
 SupSon: You can only propagate a proven draw if all the children are draws right?
 MSmits: draws and losses
 MSmits: at least 1 draw
 SupSon: how do you differentiate between between a proven draw
 SupSon: and a normal draw from a sim
 MSmits: you mean on selection&#160;?
 SupSon: 0 exact and 0.0001?
 MSmits: I simply dont select solved games
 SupSon: no when you propogate the result up the tree
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: you do the -inf +inf thing from the paper?
 SupSon: yea for proven loss and win
 MSmits: i dont do that
 MSmits: i just have a separate property
 MSmits: "status"  = -1,0,1, 2
 MSmits: 2 is ongoing
 SupSon: i guess you don't have to check the value multiple times then for the node
 MSmits: what do you mean?
 SupSon: to detect whether its a proven value
 SupSon: -inf or +inf
 MSmits: well i check this property instead
 SupSon: yea cool
 MSmits: i do it like that in every board game basically
 MSmits: it works, might not be the 100% fastest way, but if not, the cost is negligible
 SupSon: how do you store the local boards
 SupSon: i'm using a ulong and an int combiend
 MSmits: i currently use ternary storage, but i might switch back to binary
 MSmits: ternary is nice for lookups
 SupSon: what's ternary storage
 MSmits: basically a board with 1 mark in the corner is 1 if its a cross
 MSmits: 2 if its a circle
 MSmits: so 0, 1, 2 for first mark
 SupSon: hmm alright
 MSmits: 0, 3, 6 for second
 MSmits: so it's 3^9 possibilities
 MSmits: instead of 2^18
 MSmits: its about as packed as you can make it realistically
 MSmits: there's even tinier methods
 MSmits: but they take too much time to convert between
 slvt_c0d3r: wassup noobs
 MSmits: in binary there are 262144 possible boards
 MSmits: in ternary 19683 boards
 MSmits: in the smallest version 8629 boards
 MSmits: well thats the array size i mean 
 SupSon: hmm I don't have any lookups for the complete local board state
 SupSon: I only use one players
 MSmits: yes and thats fine, karliso does this too and he's nr 1
 SupSon: so I only have 512\
 MSmits: i went really far down the lookup hole
 MSmits: you can do some cool stuff knowing the entire board though
 MSmits: for example you could have a lookup array for boardvalues and bias selection
 MSmits: i dont do that, but it's possible
 SupSon: sounds like it'd slow down everything haha
 MSmits: yes, but in many games thats worth it
 MSmits: in yavalath, pb4's bot is about 5x slower than mine, but his rollout is  more accurate
 MSmits: the bots are equally strong basicaly
 MSmits: (not counting my opening book)
 MSmits: uttt is just very resistant to this. It's hard to find changes that are worth giving up performance to
 SupSon: yes
 MSmits: do you do anything fancy?
 MSmits: in uttt?
 MSmits: or just plain mcts?
 MSmits: your bot was quite strong
 MSmits: so i suspect some kind of biased rollout
 SupSon: just solver extension
 MSmits: weird, 60k rollouts does not seem enough to be on nagraroks level
 SupSon: I'm a little below him
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: he's tough to beat even now
 SupSon: he used to be #1
 MSmits: for a very long time too
 SupSon: what got you to beat him
 MSmits: hmm several things, i am not sure in what order i found them
 MSmits: i'll tell you the stuff thats public
 SupSon: teccles seems new
 MSmits: teccles heuristic helps a ton and is one thing but i found it after i beat him
 MSmits: biasing toward avoiding free move for the opponetn helps
 MSmits: i prefer winning and blocking moves in the rollout
 MSmits: random playout i mean
 SupSon: What's a blocking move
 MSmits: make sure 2 dont become 3
 MSmits: basically play the move that opponent would play to win the miniboard
 MSmits: the reason i do both blocking and winning is not to bias the rollout too much
 MSmits: in my case it was weaker when i did just winning
 MSmits: but karliso does just winning apparently. 
 MSmits: but it might be this depends on the stage of the game or something
 MSmits: not sure
 MSmits: you can go pretty far
 MSmits: experimenting
 MSmits: its just annoying that so few things actually work
 MSmits: also as was said, at the highest level bots sometimes become deterministic enough to just beat them with hardcoded moves
 MSmits: but this does not work on 99% of players
 MSmits: doesnt really work on nagrarok anyway, i tried :P
 SupSon: too stronk
 MSmits: too randok
 MSmits: random
 MSmits: it works fine on recurse and karlis
 MSmits: i recommend every player to add a bit of random
 MSmits: makes my job a lot harder
 MSmits: doesnt work on you either btw, i remember trying it
 MSmits: oh of course if i spent a month it would work
 MSmits: but you cant do that for each player
 MSmits: I should go get some sleep, gn&#160;:)
 SupSon: later dude thanks
 MSmits: any time
 ChampionCoder: Good morning, guys!
 Skynse: bedtime for me lol
 Codeab: morning
 atahiri: hello all
 mzbear: mmh.  started working on Yavalath bot :D
 mzbear: first version submitted: takes a random move, except always takes 4 in row, always avoids taking 3 in row.
 mzbear: random truly isn't a very strong strategy :D
 Robin_Hood: hi
 Robin_Hood: Good morning

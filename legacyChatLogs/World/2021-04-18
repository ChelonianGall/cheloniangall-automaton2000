 Marchete: jacek, my UCT = jacekValue + C * sqrt(log(parent visits) / visits)
 Marchete: first goes in range [-1.1 .. 1.1]
 Marchete: but the second goes [0.0 .. 4.53]
 Marchete: these are good ranges?
 Marchete: C = 1.5
 Marchete: my bot hardly win any real bot
 Marchete: and the eval is just reused from another bot, and tanh(score*factor)
 Marchete: to be in range 1.0
 Marchete: I mean, I'm doing the MCTS part, not the NN
 Marchete: so I just give heuristic eval
 ThinhMP: clsh of code now
 ThinhMP: clash of code now
 BrainNotFoundException: :ok_hand:
 VinhDaDen: hello guys
 jacek: Marchete where 4.53 does come form
 Marchete: max value seen from 
 Marchete:  C * sqrt(log(parent visits) / visits)
 Marchete: C = 1.5 FPU=0.5
 Marchete: casually the same values of your playground
 jacek: ah well the exploration can go infinity theoretically
 Marchete: I'm not sure it explores well
 jacek: eval reused from another bot, minimax bot?
 Marchete: sometimes when I try to reuse the tree I find that the enemy move is not even expanded...
 Marchete: yes
 Marchete: minimax
 Marchete: NEW ROOOT AT BLOCK:16 INDEXNODE:925 FOUND. Visits:336/18183 = 1%
 Marchete: these 336 visits are mostly because I'm forcing it at depth=1
 jacek: seems odd
 Marchete: these mean that the bot is completely ignoring the best move of the enemy
 MysteryCoder456: print("hello world")
 Marchete: like completely
 jacek: what are the eval values. do you backpropagate properly
 jacek: and you do proper eval for the current player?
 jacek: my NN is for 1st player, so 2nd player will take the minus of it
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1a0f6084-47f0-4ee9-8e18-aba638049fd4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/1a0f6084-47f0-4ee9-8e18-aba638049fd4</a>
 Marchete: maybe the curr-&gt;jacekValue = (curr-&gt;playerID&#160;!= n-&gt;playerID)&#160;? -best&#160;: best;
 Marchete: that's because I wanted it to be reusable for smitsimax
 Marchete: smitsi-jacek-max
 Marchete: I know I know
 Marchete: but I can try with a forced -best always
 jacek: hmm best = best value of children?
 Marchete: best = max(children_value)
 jacek: so parent should have -best
 Marchete: yes, I'm doing that
 Marchete: max(children_value)
 Marchete: then parent = -max(children_value)
 Marchete: curr-&gt;jacekValue = (curr-&gt;playerID&#160;!= n-&gt;playerID)&#160;? -best&#160;: best;
 Marchete: if you assume playerID&#160;!= child-&gt;playerID
 Marchete: that is always the case on MCTS
 Marchete: and I do the same action all the way up
 jacek: how about putting eval first. is this good eval with good sign?
 Marchete: probably not
 Marchete: first move gives:
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/848b7b6c-3e0f-4329-adac-0214a4e2dea9">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/848b7b6c-3e0f-4329-adac-0214a4e2dea9</a>
 Marchete: JacekAVG = move's eval value + log(move's visits)
 Marchete: i.e. "Best" score found on move 1, a -0.13
 Marchete: but best JacekAVG is move 5
 Marchete: I don't understand why move 1 isn't explored more if it has the best score
 jacek: or move when it has small visits
 jacek: 2
 Marchete: yes, 3 and 4 are very similar
 Marchete: I can't see why exploring is that weird
 Marchete: I need to recheck the whole thing
 jacek: how does it compare against minimax? at the very least it should win some of the games even if C or FPU are not optimized
 Marchete: I think explore isn't working correctly, it just always goes to Depth 23
 Marchete: wasn't expecting that deep
 Marchete: it hardly wins a player at 80th place
 jacek: actually it can go that deep
 Marchete: always depth 23
 jacek: but i believe you have bug somewhere, how does selection look like
 Marchete: I don't have vector&lt;&gt; but firstchild index and childcount
 Marchete: similar to Smits
 Marchete: so I first recover a pointer to the first child and then do the loop
 Marchete: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3641a5f4-27ae-4e2a-b32c-77331a7159e7">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3641a5f4-27ae-4e2a-b32c-77331a7159e7</a>
 Marchete: const float CONSTANT_C = 1.5;const float CONSTANT_FPU = 0.5;
 Marchete: 				SQRT_LOG[i] = /*SMIT_K_EXPLORATION * */sqrt(log((double)i));				INV_SQRT[i] = 1.0 / sqrt((double)i);
 Marchete: SQRT_LOG and INV_SQRT are cached values
 Marchete: to speed up
 Marchete: it was bad pasted
 Marchete: INV_SQRT[i] = 1.0 / sqrt((double)i);
 Marchete: SQRT_LOG[i] = sqrt(log((double)i));
 jacek: i get it. hmm i see no problem in selection
 Marchete: it was the similar to those I use in other games
 Marchete: I was thinking that it's a problem of magnitude between UCT formula
 Marchete: if I have a low exploration value it won't explore enough
 Marchete: I'll look more into it, these things are hard to tune
 Marchete: most literature just says "Pick a good C"
 Marchete: like, OK I get it, but that doesn't help
 jacek: try uping FPU to 10, should be less blind
 Marchete: OK
 Marchete: in many turns the tree reuse is saying I'm reusing like 70% of the visits (so I was predicting the enemy fairly good)
 Marchete: but on the next turn it goes to 1%
 Marchete: like I'm not seeing the enemy at all
 Marchete: your code should be like normal MCTS
 Marchete: but I don't know where I'm having my bugs
 actualCoderTrevor: For code golf can I submit more than once? I've never done one.
 jacek: codegolf puzzle?
 actualCoderTrevor: I think so. I'm doing Chuck Norris.
 jacek: yes
 actualCoderTrevor: Thanks&#160;:)
 jacek: you can submit any time, and the score will be of shortest submited code
 actualCoderTrevor: Cool, that's what I thought but I wanted to be sure. Thanks again!&#160;:)

 Ordonnateur: it is possible to get an iterator from a "int tab[]" in C++&#160;?
 struct: begin(tab)&#160;?
 struct: What are you trying to do?
 Ordonnateur: using binarySearch standard library on a tab (changing to vector cost too much ^^')
 Ordonnateur: (tryed begin(tab) but it don't like it ^^')
 struct: #include &lt;iterator&gt;
 Astrobytes: sort(arr, arr + arr_size, func);
 Astrobytes: At least I think that's what you're asking.
 jacek: owarebytes
 Astrobytes: *sort/search/whatever std method
 Astrobytes: lol jacek
 jacek: i dont want to search for std
 Ordonnateur: I'm confused, what struct said work if I create the tab before the call but not if the tab came from a function call O_o
 jacek: huh
 struct: Can you show the code?
 struct: Im a bit confused

 Ordonnateur: the test cout work but the exist one bug on begin/end saying there is no matching to those function &gt;&lt;'
 multii: yo
 Astrobytes: binary_search(tab, tab + tab_size, k)
 Astrobytes: or, y'know, use std::array
 Ordonnateur: It work but I completely don't understand why lol
 struct: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/Fl2dcRp">https://tech.io/snippet/Fl2dcRp</a>
 Astrobytes: it's a C style array, you're giving it the starting address of the memory, and the ending address. This is analogous to begin() and end()
 struct: you need to include the files needed
 struct: binary_search requires algorithm
 Ordonnateur: (I just skipped some include yeah but that part was also working for me, the error was on the other call in the class)
 struct: I think its because the function doesnt know the size of the array you are passing
 struct: so it cant use the iterators
 struct: Im not sure though
 struct: oh wait
 struct: yeap

 struct: astro solution is better
 Astrobytes: tbh I tend to keep iterators and std things for std containers only, that way I know what I'm looking at when I read my code again later
 Astrobytes: I mean, I'll still use sorts and whatnot from &lt;algorithm&gt; but I try to keep it obvious when I'm dealing with a C-style array vs a std container

 ShannonNorris97: Yeah I dedicated a bunch of time to better understand minimax and learn about alpha-beta pruning, and I found it really interesting. I think last time I looked at it I kinda rushed, so I took my time to appreciate it a bit more this time. It's so clever

 ShannonNorris97: How do you guys usually settle on a suitable depth for minimax?
 Astrobytes: Iterative deepening usually. IT depends.
 BlaiseEbuth: (╯°□°)╯︵ ǝʌɐɔsouǝZ
 jacek: iterative deepening, so it depends on time
 ShannonNorris97: Oh cool, I've not heard of that before. I'll do some digging
 Astrobytes: It's not complicated 
 jacek: you have to know time for minimax(n-1) is negligible in comparison to minimax(n)
 ShannonNorris97: oh okay, so it's based on the assumption that every time minimax is run it takes the same amount of time, regardless of depth?
 Astrobytes: No, that depth of n-1 is negligible time-wise compared to n
 jacek: you run in loop minimax(0), minimax(1), minimax(2)... until time's up
 ShannonNorris97: okay, so what does n represent in that, if not depth?
 Astrobytes: n is depth
 ShannonNorris97: oh I think I just got what you meant
 jacek: people have problem that why instead of using minimax(6) you have to loop throught minimax(0)... minimax(5)
 jacek: it may seem it wastes time, but it does not
 ShannonNorris97: No that does sound interesting, so you go to whatever point you can, rather than running out of time trying to force a particular depth
 Astrobytes: The beauty of iterative deepening is that you can order the moves to prioritise the best move from the n-1 depth at n depth (amongst many other things)
 Zenoscave: Look into  history  heuristics and killer moves too
 ShannonNorris97: Ah I see, I reckon I'm gonna save that one for tomorrow. But as always, I appreciate the help and I'll be sure to look into it&#160;:)
 ShannonNorris97: I'll look at those too Zenoscave, thank you
 Zenoscave: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Minimax">https://www.chessprogramming.org/Minimax</a> This is a good start
 jacek: so youre normal minimax is working now?
 ShannonNorris97: yeah it was doing well earlier. Made it to 80th place or something, but messed it up just now making it more complicated. Just restoring the old version now to amend it from that point. But yeah it's got alpha-beta pruning and everything and does well in the games&#160;:)
 jacek:&#160;:+1:
 Astrobytes: Good stuff!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: or you can estimate how many nodes you have time to explore and you can stop in the middle of a certain depth without a time call.  Oh god, I'm insane...but php time call is too expensive, everything is too expensive in php
 TheDictator: jag suna suna lage
 Zenoscave: Then don't use php

 Zenoscave: Maybe the default answer but every lang?
 BlaiseEbuth: There's, in the contribution section
 Zenoscave: So every lang that someone else has done . got it

 PatrickMcGinnisII: but yea a system call takes care of that i guess
 MSmits: a transpiler translates source code from one language into another?
 Zenoscave: yes MSmits
 Zenoscave: Typescript -&gt; JS is a transpilation
 MSmits: ah ok, then i learned my new word for the day, just in time too
 MSmits: it's a just in time transpiler
 Zenoscave: Can tomorrow be JIT
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I guess people do just submit the solution given in the contribution, but that's kinda janky
 MSmits: i just did JIT
 MSmits: another one
 Zenoscave: AOT
 MSmits: sure
 Astrobytes: That's a grim way to solve a puzzle PatrickMcGinnisII
 Zenoscave: or is it JAT?
 Zenoscave: predictive JIT basically
 MSmits: I dont know jat means steal in Dutch
 Zenoscave: Just-ahead-of-time
 MSmits: oh ok
 Astrobytes: Defo related to stealing
 jacek: AOT? anime
 PatrickMcGinnisII: well, no one will say i cheat using php. :P
 Zenoscave: AOT is the acronym officially according to the all-knowing Wikioedia
 MSmits: seems pretty easy to do, i just take my othello counterbook and put it in a php bot :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, show me..i need the help, rofl
 MSmits: mmh might not work because it wont solve at ply 40+
 Astrobytes: Wikioedia: Bringing wikis and wookies together
 Zenoscave: Astrobytes. Do you ever miss a typo?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I've used decompilers b4, the token symbol tables suck
 Astrobytes: Sometimes.
 BlaiseEbuth: He is [CG]Typo
 Astrobytes: I can be a little pedantic
 Zenoscave: errantly&#160;;)
 jacek: Astrotybes
 Zenoscave: astrotypes
 PatrickMcGinnisII: don't make me logophobic
 Astrobytes: AstroTypos
 Astrobytes: Pedantrobytes
 Zenoscave: PatrickMcGinnisII pentasyllabic is autological and autological is pentasyllabic
 Astrobytes: ergo
 Zenoscave: but is autological autological?
 Astrobytes: By definition I think yes
 Astrobytes: But this is a trap
 Zenoscave: Ding. ding. ding
 BlaiseEbuth: You make me crazy frog&#160;!
 Zenoscave: frog?
 Zenoscave: where's euler?
 MSmits: do you mean he makes you a crazy frog or are you saying he is a frog that makes you crazy
 Zenoscave: and he's a toad
 Astrobytes: aringdingdingdingding yourself back to the fire and brimstone Beelzébuth
 BlaiseEbuth: \o/
 BlaiseEbuth: One has the ref
 Astrobytes: I got it yep
 Zenoscave: I refuse to think of axel f
 Zenoscave: It haunts me
 MSmits: axel foley?

 Zenoscave: True
 PatrickMcGinnisII: all your polyphallus adjuncts have made you fearful of hypertropic-hyphenation

 Astrobytes: ^best one of the lot
 BlaiseEbuth: Astrobytes: This guy is so hot! I love his beard! :heart_eyes:
 PatrickMcGinnisII: One of my bosses is demanding service
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fk'in cat
 MSmits: why do i keep clicking on this :poop:
 MSmits: oww great, i was on my work account too
 MSmits: so tomorrow when i watch a YT video with my students they are going to be wondering about my preferences again
 Astrobytes: Could be worse, we could be posting GG Allin videos
 MSmits: dont make it worse please :P
 Astrobytes: I'll spare you GG doing jobbies on the stage
 PatrickMcGinnisII: YT has new DUST episodes on tonight
 Westicles: I'll spare you my favorite videos now, crows remove ticks
 struct: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 PatrickMcGinnisII: my cats watch YT, squirrels and birds ... keeps them off the kb
 Astrobytes: Hey, I actually watched those 5 videos after you posted about it Westicles. From the wallabies right?
 Westicles: Yeah, those are awesome
 Westicles: Had to clear my cookies, all I got after that was more tick videos and the dog ones are disgusting
 Westicles: Er, more disgusting
 Astrobytes: I thought it was very cool. I'm a big fan of the Corvids in general. I encourage magpies and crows to my garden with food. Just watching them stash it etc is so cool. They are ridiculously intelligent.
 Astrobytes: Eh, I worked in Corfu for a year, and the biggest hedgehog I've ever seen decided to camp outside my patio door. I have never seen so many ticks.
 Astrobytes: Wrapped it in a towel to pick it up and stuck it in a nearby bush. Didn't come back thankfully.
 Westicles: A year in Corfu?  That sounds like a great gig
 Astrobytes: It was amazing
 Astrobytes: Rough at times but on the whole, amazing.
 BlaiseEbuth: Nap and ouzo...
 Zenoscave: Did I read GG Allin
 Astrobytes: 40 degrees C is a nice temperature. Being amused at naked people on the beach while you're going to work wearing a jumper at 7am and it's 30 degrees C is just worth it
 Astrobytes: Yes Zenoscave
 Zenoscave: Bite It You Scum
 BlaiseEbuth: [CG]Allin
 Astrobytes: BlaiseEbuth: siesta or beers, or coffee (frappe naturally)
 BlaiseEbuth: :yum:
 Astrobytes: Zenoscave: heh heh
 Astrobytes: argh, GG killed the chat

 Astrobytes: well, the one out of all of the ones in there that we didn't do you mean struct?&#160;:)
 struct: yeah :p
 Astrobytes: Also I want French girls in or I'm not doing it :P
 KarimGehad: 😂😂😂😂
 struct: Not sure if tbali and Scarfield want to join
 struct: Havent seen tbali around
 Astrobytes: KarimGehad: Sorry, I don't clash so I won't comment on your contribution
 KarimGehad: okkkk thank youuuu 
 Astrobytes: TBali was on discord, he responds to discord and forum pings, not usually in chat
 Astrobytes: *webchat
 struct: ah I see
 Astrobytes: Scarfo should be up for it
 struct: 8k registered so far
 struct: on contest
 Astrobytes: Which metric do they use? Signups? Actual submissions? Those who submit more than once?
 struct: those who submit
 struct: at least on the leaderboard
 Astrobytes: Sorry, I feel a salty wave coming over me
 Astrobytes: Anyway, at least the game will be cool
 Astrobytes: Hopefully.
 struct: maybe 
 Astrobytes: It better be decent otherwise I'm taking up snooker or something.
 struct: snooker?
 Astrobytes: pool with all the red balls and colour -wise pot scores
 struct: I thought it was an expression sorry
 Astrobytes: And a very large table
 struct: I know what snooker is :p 
 Astrobytes: :D
 struct: The bar I worked at had 1 snooker + 10 pool tables
 Astrobytes: Nice. When I was cheffing, after work I used to frequent a bar with 10-12 snooker tables and 1 pool table :D
 struct: pool is more popular here
 Astrobytes: (It was a snooker club tbf)(
 struct: I never played snooker though
 struct: only pool
 struct: I was decent at it
 Astrobytes: I lie - there were 2 pool tables. Next to the bar. Snooker tables were closed off in the next room
 Astrobytes: I like both. Snooker is way more heavy on tactics and strategies
 struct: harder to pot too
 Zenoscave: I suck at pool
 Astrobytes: Always use that rest if you're struggling to make a shot, even in pool
 Zenoscave: rest?
 Zenoscave: the bank?
 Astrobytes: The long spider
 Zenoscave: oh that
 Zenoscave: I just am not athletic in any fashion
 Zenoscave: no hand-eye coordination
 Astrobytes: Or the cross
 struct: growth is exponential 
 Zenoscave: My coefficient is exponentially negative :P
 struct: its very hard at the begining 
 Zenoscave: I used to play weekly for years
 Zenoscave: never was good at all
 struct: when you saw bad, how bad?
 Astrobytes: I used to play every night. The problem was varying stages of inebriation
 Zenoscave: I table scratched every game
 Zenoscave: No inebriation to blame for me. 
 Astrobytes: The bartender also always seemed to be in the possession of some nice herbal refreshments.
 Zenoscave: That's legal here, but alas, neither that.
 Astrobytes: Those were some fun times I tell ya.
 Astrobytes: I sound like an old man :older_man:
 Zenoscave: Well. If it walks like a duck
 Astrobytes: Rearrange the popular saying: off f**k you c**t cheeky :rofl:
 Zenoscave: you should look into foaas

 Zenoscave: Just a REST API
 Zenoscave: the best one
 Zenoscave: and for the 100 or del
 Astrobytes: I keep meaning to use it somehow and never get round to it. Perhaps soon is a good time, considering.
 Zenoscave: I learned a new phrase or two from it. One being from Torvalds
 Astrobytes: You have picked up a Linusism?
 Zenoscave: devil's-c**t-head but in his native language
 Astrobytes: ooh he's like Finnish? 
 Astrobytes: I think
 Astrobytes: I don't know shit about Finnish. No one does. Except Finns.
 Zenoscave: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Astrobytes: And Finntrolls.
 Astrobytes: Oh perkeleen vittupää
 Zenoscave: that'd be it.
 Astrobytes: I see the Nordic thing, you could use fitta for c**t in Swedish
 Zenoscave: I'm starting to realize why chat gets quiet when the two of us sign on

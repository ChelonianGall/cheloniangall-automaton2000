 DialFrost: all i need is somebody to look at my code and see how to improve it (mostly js the shield part and which way to turn)
 DialFrost: maybe one of the mods? lol (u guys prob busy tho)
 Uljahn: Moderators are volunteers who enjoy CodinGame and its community. While they'll usually be happy to help you with any programming question, remember that they don't have to answer you, so don't ping them for that. Prefer an open question or check the forum.

 zite: c^vcg uhv
 zite:  ih ijfd 
 zite: vvv
 5DN1L: sigh, another one, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: it would be too hard on yourself
 zite: zitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzitzit
 zite: zitzitzitzitzit
 derjack: code4life?
 MyMonkey: I wish I was a mod :imp:
 ZacDonald: Yes 
 ZacDonald: its Code4Life&#160;:)
 Westicles: astro used to ban all these guys right away, nobody else seems to do it
 derjack: vectors in c++ are general
 derjack: what question do you have
 ZacDonald: i stock value on my vectors but they seems to dont be stock as i wanted.. like the state of deplacement of my robot, etc.. so i would know if im doing right to stock in my vectors ^^
 darkhorse64: store would be a more appropriate wording. There are a few pitfalls with vectors: one of them is that iterators may be invalidated after a push_back. If you are storing pointers to vector elements, you are doomed. Only do that when you are that your vector will not grow
 darkhorse64: you are sure
 derjack: oO
 UUolfo: anyone else get the gltich thing where your cursor is some amount to the right of where you're typing? thought insert was somehow on but toggling it made no difference?
 USSR_Chicken: mhm
 jacek: no?
 UUolfo: Randomly fixes itself too, only shows if there are spaces or chars to the right of it. so odd.
 UUolfo: I think it's my proxy or vpn acting up maybe?
 Wontonimo: i've seen that also
 Wontonimo: and i don't even use vpn
 Wontonimo: hey Automaton2000 , what are the rules this being a public chat?
 Automaton2000: and now you are a god
 Wontonimo: oh my
 5DN1L: mod is god
 Wontonimo: haha
 Wontonimo: hey 5DN1L, is there a story behind your name?  I'm curious
 5DN1L: Probably not suitable to flood the details here. If you google it you may be able to deduce the theme
 Wontonimo: oh, google, i've heard of that...  yikes, where didn't i google that first 
 5DN1L: But well, it's not coding-related, so I should not say much here
 Wontonimo: all good.  thanks for nudging me to google it 
 5DN1L: :wink:
 Wontonimo: I was hoping Automaton was going to quote my often repeated warning about this being a public chat.  The actual response was kinda funny 
 5DN1L: Maybe one day it will, yeah? Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: i have a lot of stuff
 5DN1L: Indeed
 Wontonimo: is Automaton still being fed new training data?
 Wontonimo: anyone know?
 Aquajag: i made a function that takes 2 positional arguments. i've called it a few times in my code. the last time, i get an error: "3 were given." I've tried cut and paste the earlier versions that didn't throw the error, error still occurs
 5DN1L: Aquajag what's the language?
 Mortis_666: Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: can someone help me with the temperatures puzzle?
 Aquajag: python
 Wontonimo: perhaps you forget the "self" if it was a class function
 Aquajag: it's a function in a class. the object calls the function
 Wontonimo: and the function, does it have "self" as the first argument in the function declaration&#160;?
 Aquajag: no....
 Wontonimo: def myfunction(self, arg1, arg2):
 Wontonimo: that's the problewm
 Aquajag: so, every function needs a self?
 Wontonimo: yes, unless it is a class level function
 Wontonimo: instead of an object level function
 Wontonimo: which you probably are not using
 USSR_Chicken: i was gonna say depends lol
 Wontonimo: ^^ what Chicken said
 Aquajag: ok, just seeing that in a training thing, thanks. missed it.
 Aquajag: but, when i call the function, i ignore the self spot, right? so myFnc(1, 2) goes to the myFnc that was defined as (self, 1, 2)
 Wontonimo: yes
 Aquajag: thanks. that fixed it. now to fix all my logic errors...
 USSR_Chicken: good luck lol
 USSR_Chicken: what are some good lua extensions for VS code?

 Lambert_W_Function: why does collatz conjecture time out with js
 Lambert_W_Function: literally did sme thing in python and it worked
 jacek: maybe js is slower than python? :V
 Lambert_W_Function: how is that possible
 Coelurus: Hello there fellas
 Wontonimo: perhaps one of the under lying calls is O(n) in js and O(1) in python
 Wontonimo: welcome to world chat new joiners
 Wontonimo: For new joins, this is a reminder&#160;: this is a public chat.  Please keep conversation respectful, focused on coding or codingame.  Generally stay on topic.   Cheers, and welcome

 Coelurus: Zdrawim všechny programátory a programátorky!!!
 jacek: oO
 Wontonimo: the mod checkmarks are not showing atm for most mods
 5DN1L: Coelurus: Please keep chat in English
 5DN1L: Automaton2000, I hope you didn't pick up foreign languages
 Automaton2000: there is a guy who is in the arena

 Dementedteen: please tell me I'm not the only tenth grader here that came here in search of being able to code
 Dementedteen: in search of learning I should say
 benbeast1210: I wish i came here in the tenth grade
 Dementedteen: I've been interested in games for a while, I feel like my ideas on games could change the gaming community as we know it
 Dementedteen: only bad part is learning where to start
 jacek: there are some youngers here as well
 benbeast1210: as long as you don't plan on releasing AAA games in an incomplete state, you should soar high lol
 jacek: do you have any programming knowledge so far?
 Dementedteen: nope, Just hoped on the HTML one
 Dementedteen: hopped*
 jacek: this site is good for improving what you know already, not for complete beginners
 Dementedteen: what site should I go to for beginners?
 Wontonimo: do you have a language in mind Dementedteen&#160;?
 benbeast1210: check out codewars.com for a similar experience, but less competitive
 Dementedteen: thanks ben, also I don't have a specific code in mind, but I hoping to be able to learn two
 Dementedteen: I'm*
 Wontonimo: the suggestions will probably depend on the language you choose.  if you haven't chosen a language yet, I'd say go to youtube and search for "The Coding Train"
 benbeast1210: ^^^
 Dementedteen: Ok will do. thanks for being helpful everyone. I'll be back here when I'm certain I can practice my skills
 Wontonimo: cool cool.  yeah, come back soon
 5DN1L: And hopefully the language you will learn is one of those offered here
 Wontonimo: hey Dementedteen, one last tip&#160;: don't copy paste code.  Actually type out any example you see.  it really makes a big difference in the speed of learning
 Dementedteen: thanks wontomino
 Dementedteen: will do
 blokman: hi
 jacek: msmits' mnist recognized my 0 as 9 but it turns out some random mnist site also has this problem <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/mXeYHUI.png">https://i.imgur.com/mXeYHUI.png</a>
 jacek: i think because the circle is in upper part of the box

 blokman: 0llko
 Wontonimo: haha ... i drew a very nearly perfect O and it still thought it was a 9
 Wontonimo: the training needs to focus on contrastive examples of 0 annd 9 
 Wontonimo: that is a really cool interactive notebook&#160;!
 Wontonimo: another perfect O and it classified it as a 3
 blokman: that is funny
 5DN1L: I wonder what shape the zero is in the training data
 jacek: he said it had 97% validation accuracy...
 5DN1L: is it all his own handwriting?
 blokman: 0 or o
 jacek: its mnist
 Wontonimo: oh, it is 2 Dense layers 784x200 and 200x10
 5DN1L: i mean the training data
 blokman: what
 Wontonimo: because of that it will not generalize much
 blokman: ok
 blokman: good
 jacek: mnist is standard handwritten digits benchmark
 5DN1L: ah ok
 Wontonimo: need convolution or a HUGE training set that includes a lot of variance
 jacek: training and validatin data

 5DN1L: Just don't flood the chat, please. Thanks.
 Wontonimo: the mnist data set has something like 12 different hand writing samples in it
 jacek: 60k&#160;:?
 Wontonimo: 12 different people were involved in making the 60k samples
 Wontonimo: i though.  or maybe more.  it's easy enough info to google
 Wontonimo: blokman I've kicked you once before for spamming world chat.  you even told me you'd do it again.  consider this your last warning
 5DN1L: Ah this puzzle used to be here on CG: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/blog/focus-on-machine-learning-by-loick/">https://www.codingame.com/blog/focus-on-machine-learning-by-loick/</a>
 Wontonimo: yeah, sadly it is no longer supported
 5DN1L: agreed
 Wontonimo: it's very cpu intensive&#160;;( 
 jacek: thats why we roll our own NN stuff
 Wontonimo: any way to check who downvoted a particular puzzle
 5DN1L: And one coder used NN to solve the Onboarding puzzle :nerd:
 Wontonimo: nice&#160;!
 Wontonimo: do you have a link to that solution?
 5DN1L: Yes
 5DN1L: Wait a sec

 Wontonimo: I just tried it, it works
 Wontonimo: why do you doubt jacek&#160;?
 jacek: it doesnt look like relu :v
 Wontonimo: oh, you are right!
 Wontonimo: wow, that was a quick find jacek&#160;!  holy cow
 Wontonimo: ah, it uses sigmoid not relu anyway, so that code isn't used in this particular example

 Meethy: please
 Wontonimo: on a computer
 Wontonimo: that runs assembly
 BlaiseEbuth: What a mod...
 Wontonimo: haha
 Meethy: well thank you, 
 BlaiseEbuth: Wait you're not.
 Wontonimo: which assembly&#160;?
 Meethy: the assembly that made Mac os
 Wontonimo: 86000 , 68000 , or some virtualized assembly?
 Meethy: 2012
 Meethy: I do not know, that's why I want to learn how does it work
 eulerscheZahl: Westicles 06:30PMafaik all you can see is upvotes, and only on solutions

 NormalMilkTea: hello&#160;:}
 Azmwet: can someone recommend a good source to learn Lua to write short code for shortest?
 jacek: try python or ruby for shortest
 Westicles: euler, but I think the only time you can tell identity of up/downvotes is upvotes on puzzle solutions?
 Husoski: MacOS is derived from BSD Unix, so the kernel will likely be mostly written in C. Any assembly in the original would have been some flavor of MC68000 (the MPU in the original Macs),  perhaps in inline C calls.
 Husoski: fwiw
 Azmwet: @jacek i write fluently in python and truly despise ruby so i am looking for alternatives
 Westicles: velcoro does amazing stuff with perl, but I can't imagine getting good at it is any fun

 Automaton2000: i'm kind of new to this website
 5DN1L: :facepalm:
 Overbed: how to make pyramid
 Overbed: like:
 Overbed: 2222
 Overbed: 222
 Overbed: 22
 Overbed: 2
 5DN1L: Do the opposite of what you did for your last question
 Overbed: i didnt finish the last question
 5DN1L: Now you can try
 Overbed: AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'split'at Answer.py. in &lt;module&gt; on line 2
 Overbed: what does this mean
 5DN1L: this means you can't split an integer
 5DN1L: you can split a string only
 Overbed: but i cant make it a string
 Overbed: that would ruin my code
 struct: i would do like
 struct: for (int i = n; i &gt; 0; ++i)print("2".repeat(i));
 struct: --i*
 Overbed: is this python
 Wontonimo: they need it in python ... just a sec, i'll solve it for you
 5DN1L: is there too much spoonfeeding, i wonder
 struct: im sure python has something similar to repeat
 Overbed: wontonimo werent you like mod or something 2 days ago
 struct: he was demoted for coding in python
 Overbed: what does that mean
 Overbed: he got demoted for coding using python?
 struct: yes
 Overbed: huh
 Overbed: was he giving answers?
 Overbed: also what does the ++i mean 
 struct: doesnt exist in python
 struct: its similar to i += 1;
 Synithea: it means to add 1 to i before using it's value
 Synithea: ++i is "increment i by 1 and then use i"
 Synithea: i++ is "use the value of i then increment"
 Overbed: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsingat &lt;string&gt;. not in a function on line 1at Answer.py. in &lt;module&gt; on line 1
 lakaoe: it wont replace the spaces for me

 jacek: urmum
 BlaiseEbuth: for i in range(n,0,-1):print("2"*i)
 Overbed: but i need it to be the inout number
 Overbed: so can i just remove the "2" and add n?
 Synithea: which challenge are you even doing?
 Westicles: Probably just the higher ethical standards we have in the US, you guys shouldn't be ashamed
 BlaiseEbuth: :no_mouth:
 Overbed: how can i make this alot smaller?
 Overbed: print(n,n*2,n*3,n*4,n*5,n*6,n*7,n*8,n*9,n*10)
 Synithea: using a for loop
 Overbed: for i in range?
 Synithea: idk python
 Synithea: to me it's for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) Console.WriteLine(n*i);
 Synithea: actually no
 Synithea: replace n with the desired max multiplier
 Dren: for i in range(1,11):print(n*i)
 Dren: or print(*[n*i for i in range(1,11)])
 Wontonimo: try 8 point font
 Dren: right if it's this simple you can also just print(*[i for i in range(n,10*n+1,n)])
 Wontonimo: print(*map(lambda x:x*10,range(1,n+1)))
 Overbed: SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
 Overbed: whats this
 Wontonimo: is this for your technical skills test Overbed&#160;?
 Overbed: no
 Wontonimo: really, just try it yourself
 Overbed: idk what EOF means
 Wontonimo: google is your friend
 Overbed: its private coc with my twin brother

 7-4: omg i am playing this inh school
 jacek: struct yes
 Overbed: it keeps printing 0's
 Dren: replace goes through the whole string
 Dren: so your code looks at the first character and if it's 1 turns the whole string into '00000'
 Dren: if it's 0 turns the whole string into '11111'
 struct: p`dd`.tr"01","10"
 Dren: and then flips 
 Overbed: ohhhh
 struct: should work
 struct: oh wait in python
 Overbed: whats that supposed to mean struct

 Overbed: i almost got it to work when i printed the w in the for loop
 lakaoe: it printed everything twice lol
 Dren: but it's probably better to do something like <i>.join([str(1-int(d)) for d in string])</i>
 Overbed: but idk how to likedo it in a row like 1000011100 instead of 1
 Overbed: 0
 Overbed: 0
 Overbed: 0
 Dren: because strings are not mutable 
 Overbed: oh could i have used print(" ".join(w))?
 5DN1L: Overbed set w = "" at the beginning, then w+="1" or w+="0" as appropriate
 5DN1L: do it char by char
 Dren: I think you should use 
 Dren: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit">https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit</a>

 Dren: at every step
 struct: if its golf bash should easily win this one
 Dren: so you can see what your code does
 struct: I think
 struct: tr"01,"10" should work on bash
 Overbed: whats the output in the pythontutor website?
 Dren: it's what is written on the console
 Dren: when the code is run
 Overbed: oh thanks

 Dren: you can see what i, b and w is as the code processes it
 Overbed: yes i got it to work lol
 Dren: and output will be what the print prints out at the end
 Dren: it is a useful site to understand where your code behaves differently from what you expect
 Overbed: wow thats soo cool&#160;:) thank you very much

 sneezydrag0n: @Dren yea Hungary is not that far away&#160;:)
 sneezydrag0n: I just found about this site, and I wanted to errr... 'complain' how 'wording' of instructions are not clear at all...for a newb like me.Or, maybe this site is not for newbs?
 sneezydrag0n: hello @Ednial
 Dren: what do you mean
 Dren: about instruction clarity
 Dren: I think you get into it after a while

 5DN1L: some of them provide hints
 sneezydrag0n: ^ huh, another complain: This chat do not allow you to write few sentances but isntead make pastebin paste.

 Dren: well the fundamentals are enough for Clash of Code
 sneezydrag0n: @5DN1L: I would...but I don't see 'easier' tasks'. I can't find them.
 5DN1L: These puzzles provide hints
 5DN1L: so you may start from these first

 5DN1L: oops
 Dren: look at the tags the puzzles have
 5DN1L: Onboarding
 5DN1L: The Descent
 5DN1L: Power of Thor Episode 1
 5DN1L: Mars Lander Episode 1
 5DN1L: ASCII Art
 sneezydrag0n: Yes, Im trying to do 'The Descent' task.
 5DN1L: Horse-Racing Duals
 5DN1L: They all provide hints. You can find them on the left of the IDE screen
 sneezydrag0n: Tried 'Thor' too but...wording of instructions are not clear at all for a newb.
 5DN1L: How about the hints?
 sneezydrag0n: you mean 'Game Input'&#160;?
 5DN1L: No. I mean literally a button captioned HINTS on the left
 5DN1L: with a light-bulb icon
 sneezydrag0n: I guess I'm blind. cause ..I can't find it
 sneezydrag0n: can you make a screenshot of this one:<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/the-descent</a>
 sneezydrag0n: and upload it to... imgur.com&#160;?
 sneezydrag0n: please?
 Wontonimo: like literally, it is on the left
 Illedan: Yeah
 Wontonimo: it looks like a light bulb
 Wontonimo: below the "back"
 Wontonimo: above the "forum"
 sneezydrag0n: ahhh
 sneezydrag0n: got it
 sneezydrag0n: thanks, I'll check it out
 Westicles: Tsk tsk.  When Blaise was a mod, he would have made a helpful screenshot
 5DN1L: That's why he isn't a mod any more? lol
 Wontonimo: there's a pretty easy solution to the descent
 5DN1L: wow. I can't see anything except vertical lines |||||||||
 sneezydrag0n: I checked solution... and even though it looks 'simple' its hard for me as a newb to 'think that way'.I more got used to get the task and let me make my code without you putting any starting code upfront because that confusing me.
 sneezydrag0n: and then just spend a bit more time to clearly explain what you want.
 sneezydrag0n: I guess ...this site is for more advanced newbs than me.&#160;:)
 Wontonimo: you'll get there
 Sideway: I got stucked at an Ascii Art question, started like 2 days ago xD
 Sideway: dont give up x)
 Wontonimo: really, it's just a few months grinding the basics and then this site will be a lot more useful for you
 5DN1L: the upfront code mainly has two purposes: 1. set up the input variables, 2. teach you how to debug
 5DN1L: Once you understand how the puzzles work here, you can change the default code whatever way you like
 Wontonimo: also note, the "easy" puzzles here are challenging.  in no way are they just free achievements.  there is work involved
 sneezydrag0n: @Wontonimo thats why I expected to get 'more easier' or 'easy' puzzles first to get used to it. not to be slammed like that while doing 'easy' puzzles. Maybe the are 'easy', but for a PROs, not for newbs like me.&#160;:)
 Dren: Yeah try clash of code
 Dren: those are 15 minute script challanges
 sneezydrag0n: ^ thats what I was 'forced' to do...was staring at the task instructions for 5 min and left because I didn't understand the task.
 Sideway: maybe dont get stucked on a single puzzle&#160;? you may try several ones at the same time, then you come back to the one you were struggling with&#160;;)
 Dren: yeah I'm usually doing a couple at the same time
 sneezydrag0n: I visited ...(I'm guessing) simmilar site few months ago when I wanted to check how I understand C language. It was at CodeWars and there, instrustions were more clear. Thats why I got upset with this iste here.&#160;:)
 Dren: if you submit your code for the puzzle it will save your code
 Wontonimo: here are some python puzzles you may find helpful sneezydrag0n <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/">https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/</a>

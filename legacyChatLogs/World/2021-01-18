 DoggoKt: hey
 DoggoKt: opinions on the best language for the 'least character' gamemode?
 DoggoKt: python's got just "input" and can be a oneliner
 DoggoKt: also javascript

 jacek: 1 day left for C4
 BlaiseEbuth: C4&#160;? :bomb:
 tekki: Automaton2000 what is C4?
 Automaton2000: we just have to keep track of it
 jacek: eeyup
 Passifi: gosh floating point numbers are a hell spawn ¬_¬
 BlaiseEbuth: You don't know hell... :smiling_imp:
 Passifi: well so maybe they are just purgatory but they are bad :P
 philRG: hell o

 eulerscheZahl: calm down and take a deep breath. then explain it rather than copying the same message over and over
 eulerscheZahl: Uljahn will help you, i'm off for a walk
 Uljahn: sure, just add start/end tags to your log parsing, it's NLP basics
 Uljahn: and please avoid using this channel for testing your bot&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: he's just spamming parts of darkhorse's comment from earlier. Kickable offence.
 Uljahn: i want to believe...&#160;:(
 reCurse: Chess is ready for approval
 Horizontalx: you noooooobs haha i am advaccinned
 Astrobytes: Well, you were warned./kick Horizontalx
 SPDene: does that mean you've been drinking too much advocaat? :P
 eulerscheZahl: chess crazyhorse is gone?
 reCurse: Crazyhouse
 darkhorse64: mmm .
 reCurse: Yes it's gone
 eulerscheZahl: oh
 eulerscheZahl: also darkhorse64 why does connect4 need a boss?
 jrke: for PotW he is saying
 reCurse: ^
 darkhorse64: ^
 eulerscheZahl: oh, chat history truncated
 reCurse: Geez I really feel dumb. I just realized Crazy_Remi is Remi Coulom. CG is really starting to get more famous people.
 jrke: Remi coulom?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, someone pointed that out a few weeks ago. I didn't know that name before
 eulerscheZahl: he even tweeted about getting first in that game
 reCurse: Interesting
 jrke: my endgame solver is ready and bug free but takes more than 100 ms to solve in majority of games
 eulerscheZahl: exceeding the 100ms can be seen as a bug in terms of CG bots I would say
 Horizontalx: bruh
 eulerscheZahl: ah, you are back. i hope you learned the lesson
 Horizontalx: i hate you so much &gt;:((
 eulerscheZahl: that's fine
 Horizontalx: :rage::joy:
 reCurse: Want a ban?
 DomiKo: :cry:
 awnion: ""...Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering." (c) Yoda
 reCurse: This is not a schoolyard.
 jacek: and remi said d&amp;b isnt NNable
 AshKetchum: Hi guys, how to extend Work In Progress time for contribution?
 jacek: :tada:
 AshKetchum: hi jacek, still need to implement your suggestion. festival here, so couldn't find time.
 struct: you can change it to ready
 jacek: reCurse theres crazyHouse boolean leftover
 struct: and then back to WIP
 AshKetchum: thank you&#160;:)
 JamesGrant14: yep
 reCurse: Doesn't really matter tbh
 reCurse: If it comes back it will be there already
 reCurse: Just a constant
 eulerscheZahl: it's like giving the board size in input when it's a constant
 reCurse: Indeed
 Astrobytes: Wait a sec, crazy remi is Rémi Coulom? Jeez!
 Astrobytes: wooo chat scroll
 jacek: *gasp*

 Astrobytes: yeah I got it already, epic&#160;:)
 jacek: and even he saw the clashes before bot programming :unamused:
 eulerscheZahl: "Dots and boxes is not a game where you build an intuition of who is ahead. You have to calculate exactly. And it is a combinatorial game. It may be possible to make AlphaZero work with the right network architecture, but I have not found it."
 jacek: every game is NN-friendly. you just need to find the right inputs
 reCurse: Yeah he is right. I did not properly examine the game beforehand.
 reCurse: NN are not good at precise calculations
 eulerscheZahl: "and even he saw the clashes before bot programming :unamused:"but he found the bot section, we have to hide it better
 darkhorse64: If the 5% grow, they will not be 5%
 reCurse: You think the inventor of MCTS wouldn't find it?&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: he didn't invent the page-rank algo after all
 reCurse: Eh
 jacek: or jacekmax
 kovi: on a different note: cg ranking not working with 5 players
 eulerscheZahl: google search for "dots and boxes", CG is on the 2nd page already :o
 eulerscheZahl: you tried a contribution with more than 4 players?
 Stilgart: is this even possible&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: up to 8
 eulerscheZahl: but to my knowledge no one created one with 5+ so far
 Stilgart: 2 V 2 V 2 V 2&#160;?&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs ...
 eulerscheZahl: not going to type that
 kovi: i mean 5 players on leaderboard&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: ' vs '.join([1]*8)
 reCurse: Not working as in?
 kovi: like...tryangle catch!
 Stilgart: (1 vs )^7 1
 reCurse: No matches?
 Stilgart: fix your SDK reCurse
 eulerscheZahl: few matches
 reCurse: wat
 Stilgart: :p
 kovi: 11 matches. in one attempt 80% of it was vs, 4th/5th
 kovi: i also did a 100% run, without reaching top
 eulerscheZahl: WIP is annoying to play with in general
 RoboStac: isn't that normal for contributions?
 eulerscheZahl: let me know when you've tested enough and think it's ready for approval
 reCurse: What's wrong with SDK Stilgart?
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, only after approval you'll get a reasonable amount of matches
 kovi: need to test higher leagues
 eulerscheZahl: shall I move my bot there?
 Stilgart: reCurse: was "no matches"
 Stilgart: eulerscheZahl: what about using the SDK to make a local arena&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you were to slow in your reply, i'm in the highest league now
 eulerscheZahl: that's doable
 eulerscheZahl: I do it sometimes when I'm too lazy for brutaltester
 eulerscheZahl: downside: can't play vs other users of course
 Stilgart: if it is for the creation of a good multi, people may give their own code
 jacek: playing yourself isnt that bad
 clem30980: python sucks
 GaEtAn: FUCK YOU
 jacek: hmm
 Stilgart: jacek: it is hard to balance a game by oneself
 eulerscheZahl: depends on the game
 eulerscheZahl: tryangle catch doesn't have much to tweak with
 eulerscheZahl: tower dereference: i shouldn't have released that
 reCurse: What's wrong with it
 eulerscheZahl: balancing
 eulerscheZahl: but won't change now that players wrote bots for it
 reCurse: Ah
 jacek: why not? :imp:
 ZovelosoaJph: hard

 reCurse: Just have to make sure openings are balanced enough
 jacek: bt :unamused:
 BlaiseEbuth: Has somebody tested the lopidav's tools for clashes&#160;? I don't play Cocs, and I know a lot of you don't either, but everyone is not a member of the 5%... :p  So if some clasher have tried them, or plan to, a feedback would appreciated. I want to know if they work correctly before adding them to the "Community resources" post.
 BlaiseEbuth: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/small-coc-toolkit-by-lopidav/188599">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/small-coc-toolkit-by-lopidav/188599</a>
 jacek: try #clash :v
 BlaiseEbuth:&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: didn't test, only had a look at the code
 eulerscheZahl: i think it won't work if you don't have access to the full puzzle list on CG
 eulerscheZahl: so it's interesting for the hardcore clashers (300+ can see the list i think)
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm...
 eulerscheZahl: if you plan to test, do so with a fresh account
 eulerscheZahl: also possibly buggy if there are 2 clashes with the same title
 BlaiseEbuth: erf...
 reCurse: Small coc toolkit?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes&#160;?
 jacek: microscope?
 reCurse: Phrasing.
 lopidav: eulerscheZahl not everyone have access to the accepted contributions list? I didn't know that
 eulerscheZahl: lvl29+ and those with 300+ clashes afaik
 lopidav: oh no, I need to make a note about that
 eulerscheZahl: verify my words first, i didnt test
 eulerscheZahl: but i like the idea, imo cg should add such a link
 lopidav: is there anyone here that can't access this page: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community?mode=accepted&amp;type=clashofcode">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/community?mode=accepted&amp;type=clashofcode</a>&#160;? 
 eulerscheZahl: try in incognito tab
 eulerscheZahl: or while logged out
 BlaiseEbuth: I confirm. A  newcomer can't access it.
 eulerscheZahl: with a fresh cg account?
 Knee-Gears: hey euler
 eulerscheZahl: incognito was a bad advice, even the contribute page with pending is blocked there
 eulerscheZahl: hi Knee-Gears
 BlaiseEbuth: Yeah euler, lvl3
 lopidav: Added a note, thank you for the pointing this out
 eulerscheZahl: sorry to deliver the bad news, i like the idea of the script.you could add a static dictionary of title =&gt; URL to your script and update from time to time
 eulerscheZahl: but not as nice as the way you designed it
 lopidav: about matching names: a know about that bug but I don't have time to find a way to fix it
 lopidav: eulerscheZahl I don't accept your sorry. You did right thing, thank you for pointing error out. what do you mean by "dictionary of title =&gt; URL" tho?
 eulerscheZahl: you query a list of puzzles
 eulerscheZahl: hardcode a static snapshot of it
 eulerscheZahl: in 2 weeks most clashes will still be in that list, only the very recent ones can't be found
 lopidav: oh, I see. External cashing is a good idea and you can develop it into a fine solution. Thank you
 lopidav: I will play more with XHR and links and contributions. CodingClash is not perfect and I feel like there is a way to bypass the editing rights requirements
 Vexarial: Anyone know a good formula to find the number closest to zero in an array? I cannot seem to grasp it.
 BlaiseEbuth: :thermometer:
 VizGhar: find lowest absolute value?
 BlaiseEbuth: absolute zero
 lopidav: array.sort((x,y)=&gt;x*x-y-y)[0]||'NONE'
 lopidav: replace array with var name
 lopidav: oh no, I got it wrong
 VizGhar: let him learn&#160;:)
 lopidav: array.sort((x,y)=&gt;x*x-y*y)[0]||'NONE'
 Vexarial: Yes, and I see. I think I need to do my research on the documentation. Kind of forgot what =&gt; does exactly. Honestly just getting started and dunno where to look at times.
 BlaiseEbuth: Why do you give solutions for free when you can sell them lopidav&#160;?
 lopidav: I kinda don't like capitalism tho
 lopidav: Vexarial =&gt; indicates that it's a function. (x,y)=&gt;x*x-y*y is the fast way to write function(x,y){return x*x-y*y}
 Vexarial: Oh nice. Thanks so much! 
 lopidav: any time
 lopidav: also, it's js. Should've specified this beforehand
 Vexarial: Ah, I see. Yes I am learning JS at the moment. Trying to start learning programming consistently and such. Loving it so far but jeeze I get confused.
 RyanGilbert: Ayy sick my contribution got accepted thanks to those who approved and commented if you see this lol
 JLukeSkywalker: what did you contribute?
 lopidav: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5956223929b6a2443a0b3816f7b421beea07">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/5956223929b6a2443a0b3816f7b421beea07</a>
 JLukeSkywalker: nice
 lopidav: I don't like that it has a count for the cart but no count for prices. Seems like an unneeded complication for some languages. But it doesn't really matter
 GaEtAn: cc
 JLukeSkywalker: i really hate clashes where you pass all the tests then fail validators
 JLukeSkywalker: i think its fine for puzzles, but clash it really sucks
 reCurse: So then you'd just hardcode the answers
 JLukeSkywalker: thats not how that works
 lopidav: well, you need a lot of knowledge to account for all of the solutions. It's hard
 JLukeSkywalker: im talking about like they missed checking for a &gt;= in the tests, but check in the validator
 JLukeSkywalker: just went down 15 places bc of that
 lopidav: do you remember the puzzle? the author name?
 JLukeSkywalker: no, doesnt say on results screen
 lopidav: well, can you describe it?
 JLukeSkywalker: was a summing digits puzzle
 JLukeSkywalker: hasnt been the only one
 JLukeSkywalker: its like 1/20 that are like this
 lopidav: can you describe the puzzle more?
 JLukeSkywalker: i dont remember
 lopidav: ok then
 JLukeSkywalker: in their defense I do remember they did state it in the statement
 JLukeSkywalker: its just typing in 20 seconds, hitting test, it passes, hit submit
 lopidav: classic
 Astrobytes: So, it's actually nothing to do with the validators then.
 BlaiseEbuth: Next time, post a screenshot in the chat before submitting, lopidav will solve it for you.
 JLukeSkywalker: the validator is fine, the test isnt
 JLukeSkywalker: and i did solve it, was just missing a single '='
 lopidav: BlaiseEbuth lol, no. I'll find the contributor and beat him up of course. How dare they
 JLukeSkywalker: lol
 lopidav: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/466043eeee73e2a79996c9cb42fa9ce0b01a">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/466043eeee73e2a79996c9cb42fa9ce0b01a</a> this one maybe? JLukeSkywalker 
 JLukeSkywalker: no, was comparing to see which was bigger. will get the puzzle link next time i find one
 lopidav: ok then 
 lopidav: Is there a list of possible XHR post requests for this site?
 lopidav: I mean everything under <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/services">https://www.codingame.com/services</a>
 reCurse: Not as far as I know, you have to find those yourself
 reCurse: Can also break at any point without warning
 lopidav: oh, that's the game too
 lopidav: &gt; Can also break at any point without warningWhat? I'm not aware of that. Isn't CG uses xhr almost everywhere? 
 reCurse: Sure, but the usage and availability of any API is subject to change without notice
 reCurse: It is undocumented and unsupported to use, so at your own risks
 lopidav: oh, you mean that. Yes, I'm aware that it's not official but I thought that there some lists from players
 lopidav: I was able to find one from 2016. It consists of 3 lines
 reCurse: People generally just reverse engineer whatever they need and don't bother documenting
 reCurse: True programmers in other words
 lopidav: oh, I'm something of a true programmer myself it seems.
 lopidav: ok, to the actual relevant question: can you get a contribution data with something else than public handle via XHR?
 reCurse: No clue, haven't checked contribution APIs at all. eulerscheZahl would be a better person to ask but he's asleep by now.
 lopidav: ok, gonna try next time then. Thank you for the info
 croutons:  how do you get ranked?Just playing long enough?

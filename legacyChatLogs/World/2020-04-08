 Quidome: Huh, does pacman already exists?
 Quidome: in codingame?
 Uljahn: does Automaton2000 already exist on CG?
 Automaton2000: i don't see it on the forum

 <b>**yfprojects greets AntiSquid</b></p><p><img src="/a/42391726981544" /> mark7: Hello!
 AntiSquid: what is the point of myID variable in the input?
 mark7: If you are first or second
 mark7: But it doesnt matter much
 AntiSquid: you get NA first turn as opponent message if you are first
 Ifthel: Grasping at straws, but it lets you plan around being first or second when you pick your starting position.
 AntiSquid: ok, now to figure out when that matters :thinking:
 wlesavo: AntiSquid i use it to alternate fixed seed in self play
 Acem1: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Acem1: /me
 <b>**Acem1 slaps  around a bit with a large fishbot</b></p><p><img src="/a/12110108490250" /> JFB: wlesavo - good point
 chucknorris: can you please stop recking me pb 4:( 
 pb4: chucknorris let's make a deal. Get jolindien to stop wrecking me, and i'll stop for you&#160;:)
 chucknorris: sounds like a fair deal :D 
 MJSS: Chucknorris making a deal? WHAT?
 2571540: I want a deal too
 AntiSquid: ya chucknorris should wreck them all
 AntiSquid: by 10 points difference ofc
 wlesavo: lol now thats a tactic <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/446751711">https://www.codingame.com/replay/446751711</a>
 pb4: what frame&#160;?
 Nagatwin: im doing the same wlesavo
 Nagatwin: the end pb4
 pb4: oh wlesavo's surface to go back&#160;?
 wlesavo: pb4 i mean surronding by mines 
 pb4: haha
 pb4: I was thinking the surface made perfect sense
 pb4: From the torpedo point of view
 pb4: if you go forward, you get hit by a torpedo for 2 HP
 Battat: hey, does someone know if the "force-field" of the pods is determined by the speed/thrust also?
 wlesavo: i would like to go back but i have a mine in my knee
 Nerchio: I can do move -&gt; silence -&gt; shoot in 1 turn?
 Nagatwin: yes
 pb4: Battat&#160;: ""force field"" increases mass by 10x
 Nagatwin: Everytime I open the IDE a different date shows up for the legend leage, I have to refresh cache to get the right date&#160;:/
 [CG]Thibaud: weird
 wlesavo: not every time but sometimes happens to me too
 Noobmaster69: Hello world
 aCat: Hello Noobmaster69
 amurushkin: is it legal to create a company team like "RUCHAT"?
 MadKnight: #ruchat
 MadKnight: #amurushkin
 Nerchio: is there any way to simulate X games against someone and see the results
 MadKnight: simulate&#160;?
 MadKnight: how much is X&#160;?
 Nerchio: idk 5?
 Nerchio: just want to see how I am doing against AI in like 10 games instead of waiting for 10 to finish
 MadKnight: u can download AI binary and run as many games as u want in local
 MadKnight: if they give u their binary
 MadKnight: u will even be able to run 1000 games in parallel on GPU
 MadKnight: CG servers are really busy playing other players games they can't run lots of games for u that quickly
 MadKnight: Nerchio in what language do u code&#160;?
 Nerchio: java
 MadKnight: oh, u will probably have to rewrite in C to run on GPU
 Nerchio: it's fine i will do without it i guess :D
 MadKnight: are u sure? u can test like 1000 games in seconds
 MadKnight: u can make multiple versions of your own bot to fight against each other 
 Nerchio: yea it's my first competition I don't need to go that far 
 aCat: No you definitely don't
 MadKnight: will u go that far on your second competition&#160;?
 Nerchio: maybe, we will see&#160;:)
 MadKnight: what's your current approach for this game&#160;?
 MadKnight: what does your bot do&#160;?
 Nerchio: it survives more than 10 turns that's a success 
 MadKnight: that's nice
 MadKnight: u wanna try an easier competition first&#160;?
 Nerchio: don't worry I am in silver soon it's not that bad ^^
 MadKnight: nice
 MadKnight: hey aCat and how's your bot&#160;?
 aCat: somewhat silver python approach
 Nerchio: my bot semi-well tracks the enemy and shoots =/ how  sophisticated
 aCat: and I'm rewriting everyting and making new one in C#
 aCat: as it grows bigger and I need some proper ordering in code
 Piemert: 900 lines of javascript mess here :x
 Nerchio: what league are you in?
 Piemert: gold, rank 92
 Nerchio: that's not bad in my eyes i am in bronze :D
 Nerchio: and ranking up to silver has been a pain the last 2 days
 Piemert: my script is probably not the most elegant, but I can't see anyone get into gold with just a few lines of code&#160;;)
 Nerchio: i have 650 in java so far
 Floryan: im at almost 800 in java
 Piemert: I'm not sure why I didn't pick typescript.
 AntiSquid: more like depends on the user, of course you should have picked tpyescript if that's what you use at work
 AntiSquid: 800 lines c++ btw :p
 kovi: wow, huge lead pb4
 pb4: I think it's a lucky streak
 pb4: repushing the same AI to check
 pb4: but I did like seeing this :D
 Nerchio: so you can shoot around the corners but not through islands yeah?
 pb4: Yes
 pb4: but the blast can go through islands
 Nerchio: any easy way to check line of sight that can't go through islands? :D
 2571540: Do a bfs from your position
 wlesavo: pb4 do you consider a space control aspects already?
 pb4: Nope, and I won't
 wlesavo: ok, just thinking about it, but probably wont either
 pb4: space control involves long term planning, which I have no way to introduce. I'm current only planning on the very short term
 wlesavo: same
 wlesavo: wonder if anyone will get to it
 2571540: I tried a bit
 2571540: But short term does most of the job on top10
 wlesavo: at least for now
 Nerchio: it's so satisfying to see your bot do the job :D
 Nerchio: i got promoted to silver hell yeah :D
 Riyuk: gg Nerchio!
 chucknorris: I'm sure long term area control planning will be a thing in the final top10
 yfprojects: chucknorris what do you use to keep you path this compact?
 chucknorris: bitmap
 yfprojects: thats very expressive!
 Nagatwin: "this" compact&#160;?
 yfprojects: why?
 yfprojects: his path seems very compact in comparison to other top players
 chucknorris: ahh okay. I'm not trying to keep it compatc btw. I try to maximize my available space, the count of locations where the enemy will think I am and few other things
 AntiSquid: just got a letter with Boris' signature to stay at home ... wonder how many millions they spent to send these letters out to everyone
 infinitetundra: Boris', as in life of boris?
 Nagatwin: Zoning might be a good strat actually

 Nagatwin: I guess it does not work that much on low gold
 AntiSquid: as in "belonging to", left the s out since it's s's at the end otherwise
 yfprojects: In the FAQs is says that my program is run on a multi-core architecture. 
 yfprojects: So am I able to use these cores?
 Nagatwin: Never tried using multi_core programs but I think you can try

 wlesavo: contest is out lol
 Nagatwin: AntiSquid what's that&#160;?
 Nagatwin: next contest&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no, just old multi
 AntiSquid: never got published
 Nagatwin: oh
 Nagatwin: isn't next contest Pacman too&#160;?
 wlesavo: i guess we can train on this one :slight_smile:
 wlesavo: perfect timing btw
 AntiSquid: it's not going to be this game
 Nagatwin: Yeah I hope so would be unfair :p
 aCat: Looks great!
 aCat: I would like to see source later.Is there only one level?
 AntiSquid: i will upload referee later
 aCat: oh, there is download button :D
 AntiSquid: one level
 AntiSquid: will add more levels later if people request it i guess
 aCat: but sorry for now - ooc-focused&#160;;]
 wlesavo: AntiSquid did you deleted it?
 AntiSquid: Thibaud said he doesn't want it shared
 AntiSquid: first he said sure, so i thought it's ok, but i guess they might want to release it officially for pacman celebration?
 AntiSquid: along with the real contest maybe?
 wlesavo: oh, i see
 Nagatwin:&#160;:'(
 wlesavo: too bad i was not fast enough to see the grapichs 
 darkhorse64: I was, hehe

 [CG]Thibaud: sorry guys&#160;:(
 AntiSquid: lol i got too eager to share it also
 darkhorse64: IP problem or is it just temporary&#160;? Not that we are starved atm
 [CG]Thibaud: we've got an issue. We're looking into it
 andrei00001111: I have a problem. I've received a mesage that said I was promoted to the Bronze League, but I didn't actually get promoted. Any ideaa how to resolve this?
 joeltonyf: Is the codingame multiplayer working?
 andrei00001111: Oh, the gaame is Coders Strike Back.I have no idea is thge multiplayer is working. I've found this site 2 or 3 days ago

 mat_cloud: :pig:
 Nagatwin: Too bad AntiSquid I was up for that training :D
 Nerchio: if somebody saw my code i feel like they should ban me from coding for the rest of my life
 MadKnight: don't worry Automaton2000 seen worse codes
 Automaton2000: i watched a lot of draws
 MadKnight: if u get banned from coding how will u improve your code Nerchio&#160;?
 Nerchio: I guess I won't it will forever be a silver bot
 MadKnight: u wanna try another contest&#160;?
 MadKnight: an easier one
 MadKnight: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/coders-strike-back</a>
 MadKnight: practice is practice, Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: why are u not playing csb
 MadKnight: exactly Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you need to play against me
 MadKnight: then write a bot Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: wonder if i can figure out how to write a ga
 Nagatwin: Hahhaaa
 Nagatwin: Mk and csb is some kind of a love story
 MadKnight: Nagatwin teach Automaton2000 to write a GA so Nerchio could play vs him
 Automaton2000: that makes it more complicated
 MadKnight: Nagatwin u got another easier contest for a guy&#160;?
 Nagatwin: Csb is not that easy
 AntiSquid: omg CSB spam again
 MadKnight: just use -3vel and u're golkd
 Nagatwin: :D
 MadKnight: AntiSquid join us
 AntiSquid: there are far easier games on CG
 MadKnight: Nagatwin maybe u just don't like vectors&#160;?
 Nagatwin: haven't found that 3vel yet stuck in silver xD
 MadKnight: AntiSquid your dota isn't easier
 AntiSquid: nerchio better play code a la mode it's more fun
 Nagatwin: dota&#160;? :o
 AntiSquid: it's more fun than CSB MadCarpet_7f43
 MadKnight: yea there is dota on CG
 AntiSquid: MadKnight
 Nagatwin: MadCarpet :D
 MadKnight: don't be a mad carpet Automaton2000
 Automaton2000: you can do it as a win
 Nagatwin: gota find this one
 Nagatwin: dota find this one*

 Nagatwin: looks cool
 Nagatwin: gotta try someday
 Nagatwin: still lacks jungle camps
 MadKnight: fix your dota AntiSquid
 AntiSquid: it has camps Nagatwin
 AntiSquid: they spawn later during the game 
 AntiSquid: see the (brown thingies) groots at the top
 MadKnight: can u camp a camp spawner Automaton2000&#160;?
 Automaton2000: trying to make my bot a little bit :p
 AntiSquid: and the top down view wasn't our idea, we just had to go with it nagster
 AntiSquid: lol i keep pinging the wrong people, sorry folks
 Nagatwin: I'll try this one mb bewteen pacman and ooc
 Nagatwin: what are the PM strats like&#160;?
 AntiSquid: no trees, just bushes
 Nagatwin: bush search algorithms ,
 Nagatwin:&#160;?
 Nagatwin: next level data structure
 AntiSquid: heuristics i think
 AntiSquid: there are some sims
 Nagatwin: I kinda like heuristics
 AntiSquid: do you mean in regards to gameplay or algorithms?
 MadKnight: yea most are heur
 Nagatwin: Both if you know :D
 AntiSquid: because there are lots of different weird tactics when it comes to gameplay
 AntiSquid: don't think it's that well explored yet
 Nagatwin: Is this contest old&#160;?
 AntiSquid: 2017&#160;? not sure anymore
 AntiSquid: or 2018&#160;?
 Nerchio: should i refactor my 800 lines of code it will take like 1 hour at least or just leave my bot in silver forever :D
 AntiSquid: Nerchio i have 800 lines of ugly C++, stop worrying so much about it and rewrite if you have to, i am rewriting right now since i really need cleaner code and different structure
 Nagatwin: I had to rewrite 1500 lines for this context to revert the way my bottom structure was working&#160;:'(
 Nagatwin: Was worth it, learned a lot
 elsinnombre2d2: what a codes xD
 elsinnombre2d2: i only have 500 lines
 Nagatwin: I like verbosity and having pretty debug functions
 Nagatwin: probably 30% of it is mostly useless
 elsinnombre2d2: that explain it
 Nagatwin: But saves time for debug
 Nagatwin: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ffc052b7-9872-4788-bbfc-4a4c105a7f27">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ffc052b7-9872-4788-bbfc-4a4c105a7f27</a>
 elsinnombre2d2: is there any way of watch the best codes when the competition ends?
 eulerscheZahl: no. just read text descriptions
 Nagatwin: No (un?)fortunately the code others do it not shared
 elsinnombre2d2: sad
 Nagatwin: you only have acces to the posts some publish describing their strat
 eulerscheZahl: example for the previous contest: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/unleash-the-geek-feedback-strategies/133878">https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/unleash-the-geek-feedback-strategies/133878</a>
 Nagatwin: I still wish there would be more code sharing / reviewing on this website
 Nagatwin: It's easy to discover algorithms &amp; stuff here but hard to have some feedback to improve
 eulerscheZahl: the game still continues. no fixed deadline with glory and possible prizes to win. when someone shares a top bot. many will read it and probably learn something from it
 eulerscheZahl: but a few just copy-paste it into the arena, ruining the fun for those who still want to play the game
 eulerscheZahl: the 3rd placed hypersonic contest bot is on github. with the consequence of having almost 100 bots saying "SAYONARA" when they die
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl do you mind giving the link in pm&#160;?
 AntiSquid: kinda considering to share my data structure for OOC though, i wonder if there's a simpler way to build this thing
 Nagatwin: Antisquid I'm up to this kind of things too. I did 4 different structure, each one having different up/downsides
 eulerscheZahl: i changed my representation tooPath from List&lt;Cell&gt; to bool[]
 AntiSquid: ^ ugh i wonder how you manage to cope with just that ... would have tought vector&lt;Cell&gt; would be best
 eulerscheZahl: bool[] is faster to check if a cell is already visited
 eulerscheZahl: and an extra var to store the current position (which used to be the last entry of the list)
 Nagatwin: arrays save class allocation time + make garbage collector's job easier I guess
 Nerchio: i use boolean[][] and int[][] but i am beginner 
 eulerscheZahl: and for C# a 1D array is significantly faster than 2D (at least on Mono, which CG still uses)
 eulerscheZahl: for .net core I didn't measure a difference iirc
 Quidome: I think the rating system is somewhat broken. When you resubmit you drop 30 places (after initial submit matches), 12 hours later you climb gradually 30 places. This is really strange
 Quidome: (with teh same version)
 Nerchio: I thought ever submit drops you to the end of your league :D
 Quidome: yeah that is true, but after the recalc you shot roughly be at the same spot
 Quidome: and that is not the case
 Quidome: And i suspect it is only happening when you somewhere at the end of the list
 Quidome: at least in the last 50% part
 AntiSquid: yes there are better ways to sort out ranking
 Nagatwin: 2 submits may have bad/good luck and vary a lot
 Nerchio: so if i get to 100% of battles i won't get recalculated anymore?
 AntiSquid: just hope the last submit is the best :p
 Quidome: Yes, but it is always this same pattern for me. Submit, wait 12 hours and then i am back
 eulerscheZahl: i observe such behavior when there's something fundamentally wrong with my bot (e.g. occasionally crashing)
 eulerscheZahl: otherwise my ranking is mostly stable on resubmit usually
 AntiSquid: also you can drop way below your real rank if stronger bots keep being submitted
 Quidome: Hm that is interesting
 AntiSquid: if weaker ones get submitted you get pushed up
 Quidome: @antisquid, true, but that is not the issue here
 Nagatwin: eulerscheZahl On top20 this is true, but below 50 the last battles have a big influence on where you end up
 eulerscheZahl: hm..i rarely play in that regions :innocent:
 Nagatwin: Haha
 Quidome: @eulerscheZahl, this fundamentally wrong remark is interesting
 AntiSquid: part of the issue imo, if you submit when a stronger bot is climbing you occasionally fight it and get dropped while submit is still not even finished
 AntiSquid: Quidome
 Quidome: Yes, but here are the numbers.
 Quidome: I am at 130, then I resubmit and after the complete resubmit i am at 160. Wait for 12 hours and back at 130
 eulerscheZahl: the fundamentally wrong part makes you lose vs all kinds of bots, even lower ranked ones
 eulerscheZahl: when you wait long enough after your submit, you mostly play against those in your region, which are pushing you up slowly
 Quidome: Yes, but how will this result in a grudual climb?
 eulerscheZahl: race condition or do i still have to explain it?
 dbdr: AntiSquid why would strong people submitting affect you more than the people around you?
 AntiSquid: you lose more dbdr
 eulerscheZahl: because you are the special snowflake
 Nagatwin: dbdr when a stong one submits, he crushes you with low elo
 Quidome: YOu play against yout region, how is that workoing?
 Nagatwin: so you basically loose 1-5 more battles depending on your luck 
 dbdr: you lose more than what? than the people around you? then you deserve to go down
 Quidome: How is it working anyway? I assumed a resubmit plays evryone on the list
 eulerscheZahl: others submit and play against similar ranked bots most of the time (including your bot with a fundamental bug that makes you lose 10% of the games for whatever reason)
 AntiSquid: ah missread, well dbdr it's random, sometimes you don't lose, since you dodge, but depends on luck i guess
 dbdr: definitely there is noise
 eulerscheZahl: but in 90% you play well and win most of the matches. so you just need more games to climb in ranks than you should need without the fundamental bug
 dbdr: I agree with eulerscheZahl, an unstable rank for your bot does not necessarily the ranking system is broken
 Quidome: Aha, that is interesting
 dbdr: it can be you play well against some kind of bots and badly against others
 dbdr: the solution is to improve your bot&#160;;)
 Quidome: The thing is there is something going wrong sometimes. So your analysis works on my case
 eulerscheZahl: that too. and when the rock to your scissors keeps submitting all the time, your rock will sink like a stone
 dbdr: but it's easier to complain about the system&#160;;)
 AntiSquid: and also i mentioned both situations, including the time when weaker ones submit and you get to climb
 dbdr: as well as everyone else?
 AntiSquid: but really you can't be sure if you really are above or below player x
 dbdr: everyone goes up? :D
 Quidome: I am not complaining, I  am a happy camper. Just trying to understand
 AntiSquid: dbdr randomly
 AntiSquid: some get more bad match ups some better
 dbdr: right
 inoryy: dbdr say you're top50 and resubmit at the same time as top5, you end up meeting around top100. first, there's double the chances of playing (since you and him request a game from the same region), second, when you lose it will affect your std.dev much more than somebody who's already stabilized. so you can randomly crash 100 ranks and then have to re-climb.
 dbdr: it will affect it less
 AntiSquid: you can 30 spots today, drop 60 tomorrow, but nobody really improved
 dbdr: because the system knows that player is not yet placed with certainty
 chucknorris: with a fresh submit your sigma will be bigger and wont affect less your opponents points
 inoryy: xD
 dbdr: the main problem is the ranking does not display the variance, just keeps it internal
 AntiSquid: hard to see since you expect everyone improved, but after resubmit you might end up at 30+ spots above what you should be and you wonder ...
 chucknorris: will*
 dbdr: so we easily misinterpret what we are shown
 inoryy: that's not how it works, dbdr
 dbdr: not saying the system is perfect. but it's better than many people think
 eulerscheZahl: :popcorn:
 dbdr: it is, I read the TS paper
 inoryy: I also did and have bsc in stats
 redet-G: hello
 redet-G: world
 AntiSquid: did you play on halite? it's a good example of a more accurate leaderboard
 dbdr: good. so you agree it's hard to reason when you are shown avg - var only, no?
 Quidome: Thnxs for the discussion guys! Really helpfull&#160;:)
 inoryy: sure, but it doesn't invalidate my explanation
 Quidome: I will go back, fixing bugs :P
 inoryy: double the chances of meeting and much wider sigma swing on a loss
 dbdr: you are saying losing against someone with a high variance makes you go down more?
 dbdr: that sounds backwards to me
 AntiSquid: this was supposed to be a quick random mention, not a fulfledged debate, it's not that great and there are some better ways already out there. that's all i wanted to say
 inoryy: your sigma is high as well, it jumps wildly on losses
 dbdr: yes, but that's just sigma
 dbdr: and we interpret it as going down
 inoryy: just do a resubmit and track your progress, every loss in the first ~30-40 games will drop you like crazy
 dbdr: because that's wha CG shows, but it's not
 dbdr: yes, your rank, not your hidden avg
 <b>**dbdr afk</b></p><p><img src="/a/40823886320345" /> inoryy: your mean drops because your sigma is high....
 geouwu: getting gold league is a good thing right
 geouwu: i started using this app a few hours ago
 Nagatwin: yes it is
 dbdr: no, your mean - sigma drops because sigma is high&#160;:)
 dbdr: well, both actually
 dbdr: there, everyone's right! :D
 Nagatwin: the mean could go higher with a high sigma too
 AntiSquid: company leaderboard is an interesting way to motivate colleagues to join eh&#160;? 
 Nagatwin: yeah
 Nagatwin: Im noo sure my startup colleagues are too technical but thats for sure a good way to motivate
 Nagatwin: not*
 AntiSquid: so University of Wroclaw is the best? 
 JFB: I think that it is a lot of  aCat's students. Probably he will give them points in egzams or simply result of the contest will be egzam's score 
 AntiSquid: is there a pretty way to split strings by character in C++&#160;? nothing looks elegant when compared to what other languages have

 tranculent: I'm not sure if we can ask questions in regards to the Ocean of Code challenge but how did you get all the 4 cells around (x,y)? I've implemented it but I am using 4 loops which I don't think is very optimal. 
 Nerchio: just check (x-1, y) (x+1,y)  (x, y+1) (x, y-1)
 Nerchio: :p
 JFB: In my representation each cell is a bit in 256 bit number. 
 elsinnombre2d2: why do u use this representation?
 AntiSquid: i use dir array tranculent
 Nerchio: in theory you can surface -&gt; move -&gt; torpedo -&gt; sonar -&gt; silence -&gt; mine in 1 turn? :D
 AntiSquid: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://youtu.be/z5YhwAqT7Iw?t=1604">https://youtu.be/z5YhwAqT7Iw?t=1604</a> i find it convenient tranculent
 JFB: Nerchio - not nly in teorey - in practice too 
 elsinnombre2d2: a good approach could be to use silence after use torpedo
 tranculent: thank you AntiSquid, that will definitely help (y)
 Nerchio: why elsin?
 elsinnombre2d2: he
 elsinnombre2d2: coz when u shoot is easy to know where u are
 Nerchio: i guess they can pinpoint your location more
 JFB: Becouse torpedo inform about your position - and silence will mask your position
 JFB: Addionally you can faster fun from your opponent and you will add time to recharge torpedo
 JFB: If you lunch torpedo you think that you are neer you opponent. So afer torpedo you are without torpedo neer your opponent - it not looks as good for you is not it?
 JFB:&#160;;-)
 Nerchio: smart guy :D
 Nerchio: I just hope my opponents can't track and i am free to do whatever i like
 JFB: In silver and for sur - in gold - it is not valid assumption that ypur opponent can not track
 Nerchio: yea i know i am in silver
 elsinnombre2d2: im trakcing the opp since bronze, with a very good accurate
 Nerchio: I still hope my opponent is bad at tracking :D
 elsinnombre2d2: the silence is the best tool to avoid that
 elsinnombre2d2: its not really hard to track the opponent
 Nerchio: when i tried to do perfect tracking which accounts every possible silence location it takes too much time for me 
 JFB: Using only sillence is enoug to promote to gold. But it is only enough to be aroud the end of gold. 
 JFB: ~160 
 JFB: Maybe !180
 JFB: Track + silence = #180 in gold (only)
 KANEKI: yeoooo
 JFB: You have to add mines at least to better position
 KANEKI: If you have N buckets, and the distance between them is D, and each time you move the buckets you split S water for units of water
 KANEKI: How do you find the total spill
 KANEKI: Assume n/2 buckets are filled
 JFB: Add each spill&#160;?&#160;;-)
 KANEKI: If odd, round down
 KANEKI: So what would be the eq
 JFB: Why to move bucket? If it is no move = spill is 0 -&#160;:-)
 KANEKI: You have to move buckets
 KANEKI: Only time spill is 0 is if N is zero
 KANEKI: which is the number of buckets
 KANEKI: Or if its 1 because only n//2 is filled
 KANEKI: How would you find the total spill, help
 JFB: So final result is all woter in only 1 bucket?
 JFB: You explained starting point (N buckery, N/2 filled with woter) but you do not explained the final result
 JFB: Without knowing the goal - it is not possible to answer your question (what will be total spill)
 Nerchio: do you guys use sonar?
 Nerchio: if you have superb tracking it's probably not that useful
 eulerscheZahl: when the opponent makes clever use of surface, it still helps
 eulerscheZahl: but currently my sonar is deactivated
 AntiSquid: probably sonar is good if you want to track everything and reduce the possible paths Nerchio
 pb4: sonar is good to find the opponent early
 Noobmaster69: Anyone here interested in Tron battle?
 Noobmaster69: The bot programming game
 TERMINATE: mashiron noob
 MadKnight: Noobmaster69 u wanna rekt somebody&#160;?
 Noobmaster69: Haha
 kovi: is there a define for c++ to differentiate between ide and submission?
 Noobmaster69: Yeah I wanna reck Thor
 pb4: kovi no idea
 chucknorris: some1 told that there is a debugger attached to the ide environment kovi
 chucknorris: my code is much slower in the ide 
 pb4: oh&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: but afaik there is no way to check in code if you are in the IDE or arena
 eulerscheZahl: except if you code in Rust
 kovi: thx
 JFB: I just checked NDEBUG - it is not set in IDE and in submition too
 JFB: In some environmend NDEBUG is set in release - but not in CG it looks
 pb4: kovi&#160;: why would you want to detect if you're in ide or submission&#160;?
 Illedan: I guess you can crash yourself in the IDE to prevent others from benching against you :P
 kovi: actually dbdr does that
 kovi: pb4 - debug messages
 Illedan: he timeouts?
 kovi: hmm, i havent checked
 kovi: could be
 RoboStac: probably not intentionally, thats just how rust works on cg
 dbdr: kovi not on purpose...
 Illedan: Maybe it's possible to run an IDE match in Release mode, just not in the UI? Anyone knows?
 kovi: i c
 dbdr: the way I know it to send a compiled binary
 kovi: uh, so heuristical game
 dbdr: no, in the arena ist's fast
 dbdr: it's
 eulerscheZahl: don't let the binary be your final submit. that can cause a disqualification
 dbdr: I know
 pb4: ^
 dbdr: I never submit a binary
 eulerscheZahl: pb4 knows...
 dbdr: that's why it times out for you in the ide&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: was Thales soccer, wasn't it?
 pb4: Yup
 dbdr: that one had prizes too, no?
 pb4: It was more a reflex than anything else -_-
 eulerscheZahl: it had prizes
 Illedan: Would you get a prize? :P
 pb4: sending a binary doesn't improve performance
 pb4: actually in some cases it reduced it
 eulerscheZahl: robo won a bicycle i thinkbut then got the money instead
 pb4: (vindinium)
 dbdr: fix your compiler&#160;;)
 eulerscheZahl: or was that decathlon?too many contests
 RoboStac: it was decathalon, but that was the soccer one
 dbdr: pb4 why do you do it then?
 eulerscheZahl: thales was the CSB2 then?
 RoboStac: the ctf one I guess?
 eulerscheZahl: yes
 pb4: for NN dbdr
 dbdr: ah, for the data?
 AntiSquid: the weights i guess
 eulerscheZahl: i don't like to call it CTF, as i connotate that with finding security issues in a system
 pb4: I spent a lot of time on CSB so the process of "run the script, put on CG" is a bit ingrained in my fingers :D
 dbdr: capture the flag is a phisical game you can play outdoors, originally&#160;;)
 pb4: The script is really convenient, it already puts the binary data in your "copy/paste buffer" 
 eulerscheZahl: running my build script merging multiple code files into one for submitting is even part of my project settings
 eulerscheZahl: so i can understand that you didn't really think about it
 dbdr: I do the same
 Nagatwin: pb4 for NN do you have a preferred way of embedding weights&#160;?
 dbdr: # generate filecat file | xclip -selection c
 pb4: yup, that's it&#160;:)
 dbdr: in bash the script
 Nagatwin: Apart bins :p
 pb4: Nagatwin&#160;: directly within the compiled binary
 Nagatwin: pb4 and when you should not upload compiled bins&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: hm, sounds conventient...but when i'm debugging i don't want to replace my clipboard
 pb4: constexpr array&lt;float, 1000000&gt; weights = {0.21231,0.23213, 0.3213...}
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl use a clipboard history manager
 namaska: Can you help me  with my problem into my code&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: i never heard about it but now i need it
 dbdr: you 8definitely* need it
 dbdr: incredibly convenient
 pb4: never heard about it either
 dbdr: I use Parcellite
 pb4: on which os&#160;?
 Nagatwin: pb4 don't you reach the maximum file size&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: linux
 eulerscheZahl: let me apt install it quickly
 pb4: nagatwin&#160;: yes you're still limited, but you can pack much more
 pb4: 1 float in text = mabe 9 characters
 eulerscheZahl: installed, how to use it?
 dbdr: it sits on my taskbar
 pb4: 1 float in binary = 32 bits, so only 4 characters
 dbdr: let's see how I start it
 eulerscheZahl: i have no taskbar
 Nagatwin: Yeah
 dbdr: probably in login script
 pb4: there is also some regularity
 pb4: most floats are around 1
 AntiSquid: idk, it's quite limited, how many floats do you get in total pb4&#160;?
 dbdr: i3wm
 eulerscheZahl: status bar
 eulerscheZahl: i3status
 dbdr: that one
 pb4: so you can zip the weights and they'll be reduced even more
 pb4: AntiSquid&#160;: I don't remember but quite a bit
 AntiSquid: yes that's what i mean, quite a bit, isn't it too easy to exceed the limit?
 pb4: 15k floats is relatively easy to pack
 pb4: You can also use less precision on your floats
 dbdr: eulerscheZahl I haveexec parcellitein ~/.config/i3/config
 pb4: keep only 18 bits for example
 pb4: etc...
 AntiSquid: how low would you go on the decimal count for weights
 eulerscheZahl: ok, got it running already
 eulerscheZahl: thanks
 pb4: many techniques to store more
 dbdr: pb4 what kind of network sizes do you typically use?
 pb4: AntiSquid I've gone as low as only 12 bits per float and didn't see any adverse effect
 dbdr: oh, 15k weights?
 eulerscheZahl: from the man page:Hotkeys
 eulerscheZahl: i don't know half of those keys
 dbdr: :D
 wlesavo: &lt;Super&gt; &lt;Hyper&gt; &lt;Release&gt;
 dbdr: sounds naughty
 eulerscheZahl: man page from 2011either poorly maintained or it works that well that it doesn't need any updates
 eulerscheZahl: i'll hope for the latter
 dbdr: works fine for me
 AntiSquid: "man page" :thinking:
 eulerscheZahl: for me too, so far
 eulerscheZahl: haven't tested much
 eulerscheZahl: do you want a woman page AntiSquid?
 AntiSquid: you called it that twice :D
 eulerscheZahl: 2 women pages
 AntiSquid: must be a really manly page
 dbdr: if you don't know how to use it:man man
 eulerscheZahl: i never thought about entering that command. but now it makes sense that it exists
 dbdr: gcc gcc.c
 dbdr: half the fun in CS is self-referential stuff&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: we need a quine puzzle in an esoteric language here on CG
 pb4: when is legend by the way&#160;?
 struct: friday
 kovi: yay, lucky rolls for me
 pb4: nice all green
 dbdr: all green?
 AntiSquid: all tests ok&#160;?
 pb4: he has &gt;50% against everyone
 dbdr: ah&#160;:)
 duckquackduck: what kind of pathing algorithm does the Silver boss use? It is sooo smooth 
 AntiSquid: in ocean of code?
 duckquackduck: yes
 eulerscheZahl: no idea, it's a user who was selected as a boss
 eulerscheZahl: so only that user and CG staff can tell
 dbdr: wasn't it inoryy?
 duckquackduck: ah I see. Its very nice though 
 eulerscheZahl: inoryy = bronze boss
 eulerscheZahl: silver is Risen i think
 inoryy: oh what
 eulerscheZahl: you are the bronze boss
 inoryy: how did I miss that
 wlesavo: lol
 eulerscheZahl: roll back to your old bot from bronze opening and test yourself
 skal: rip
 dbdr: and your path is smooth&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: bronze players optimize against your bot and then destroy you in silver :D
 inoryy: it all makes sense now
 dbdr: rip
 dbdr: oh, so it's quite bad to be boss gold too then?
 eulerscheZahl: i think so
 eulerscheZahl: i hope i won't be the boss :P
 dbdr: never heard that theory b4
 dbdr: but it makes sense
 eulerscheZahl: especially in a rock paper scissors game
 dbdr: make sure to be higher or lower&#160;;)
 dbdr: of the unknown rank
 eulerscheZahl: for a sim heavy game like mean max i would care less
 wlesavo: make them to optimize against a different version and then destroy everybody
 Quidome: @R4N4R4M4, i am debugging my opponent trace and using your debug messages. At some point you have a different answer and I think I am right but not sure of course, interested in a debugging session?
 inoryy: haha <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446914756">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446914756</a>
 eulerscheZahl: Quidome try another bot that prints stats too. to see if it's you or r4
 Quidome: hm, can do that, but that will be a differnet match&#160;:)
 dbdr: inoryy nice. I was thinking, game is ot symmetrical, they should diverge
 eulerscheZahl: of course it will be a different match
 Quidome: :P
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446915569">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/446915569</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my numbers don#t match with r4
 Quidome: Aha, thnxs a lot
 eulerscheZahl: i print me tracking the opponent first and then the opponent tracking me
 eulerscheZahl: paths + cells
 eulerscheZahl: (current cells)
 Quidome: cool, going to try yours then&#160;:)
 eulerscheZahl: zenoscave is printing stats too (or was the last time i checked at least)
 Quidome: great, thnxs
 R4N4R4M4: Hi everybody
 Quidome: Hi
 R4N4R4M4: Quidome, my detection is not really good, I'm working on it
 Quidome: Aha, ok, thnx
 eulerscheZahl: mystery solved
 R4N4R4M4: Because I'm using heuristics and not simu
 Quidome: I will put in stats myself for comparison
 kusrabyzarc: Sorry, but can you check it, please: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4941a1bc0861e1fc3aec3cfc2872f54f9f53">https://www.codingame.com/contribute/view/4941a1bc0861e1fc3aec3cfc2872f54f9f53</a>
 eulerscheZahl: my tracking is finished (including mine explosions that reduce candidates for previously visited cells)
 eulerscheZahl: so if you get discrepancies, there is a bug in one of our bots
 eulerscheZahl: if it's me, i'd like to know about it&#160;;)
 R4N4R4M4: eulerscheZahl, it is a great contest you made, and a tough one :D
 Quidome: OK i am going to look into it now
 eulerscheZahl: yeah, which "I" made :smirk:
 eulerscheZahl: but i like it too
 eulerscheZahl: my part was the smallest of the 3 users mentioned
 blasterpoard: kusrabyzarc the statement is unclear and gramatically incorrect
 blasterpoard: imho it shouldn't be approved in its current state&#160;:(
 eulerscheZahl: and now write the same on #ru
 Quidome: mine explosions for previous visited cells...
 Quidome: Didn't thought of that yet
 Quidome: hm, more to do :D
 Octothorpe: hi
 kovi: hmm, maybe not so lucky rolls this time
 Nerchio: wait
 Nerchio: can yo do silence with 0 range?
 Nerchio: "This allows you to move 0 to 4" omg :D
 aCat: yep
 aCat: thats a dirty trick
 Nerchio: i just found this out and i am in silver
 aCat: cause you ignore that you visited this square
 kovi: i player silence n 0 till silver
 Nerchio: i am changing my structure and my bot doesnt track silence yet but it tracked the enemy properly because silence 0 
 Nerchio: haha
 Nerchio: so it's like waiting a turn for your bot?
 Nerchio: i know enemy sees it different but for you
 DEIZ21: is it possible to drop a mine and trigger it in the same turn?
 mark7: NO
 DEIZ21: thx
 DEIZ21: and surface and move in the same?
 DEIZ21:&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: why would we need both commands then? they are not the same
 mark7: Yes
 aCat: why no?
 aCat: you can't place mine and trigger
 mark7: NO you can't place mine and trigger same mine
 DEIZ21: cause i tried dropping a mine and trigger it in the same turn but it doesnt work even it seems ok
 eulerscheZahl: why "why no?"?
 aCat: I mean it makes sense - place and fire
 aCat: bu&#160;:(
 DEIZ21: yes but not allowed by the referee
 mark7: aCat DEIZ21 Please read decription
 eulerscheZahl: because rules disallow it, that's why
 DEIZ21: already done
 eulerscheZahl: rules of the original game disallow it too i think
 eulerscheZahl: "You can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn."
 DEIZ21: i didnt see any thing speaking about triggering the same mine in the same tunr
 mark7: eulerscheZahl can you post replay of our bots?
 aCat: OK, there is in triger description&#160;!

 DEIZ21: ok my bad
 mark7: And maybe some advice too.. :grin:
 DEIZ21: what advice?
 mark7: How to improve
 DEIZ21: so tell me&#160;:)
 mark7: As now  i can successfully track my possiblities in opponent and opponent possibilites
 DEIZ21: yes it s on my agenda
 DEIZ21: cutting paths with mines too
 DEIZ21: not implemented yet
 DEIZ21: i lost 30 rank in 2 days
 DEIZ21: so i need to improve
 eulerscheZahl: do you try to avoid my mines mark7?
 JBM: hey eZ you still around?

 JBM: what's match end condition wrt winner decision?
 JBM: i had the following two in mind
 mark7: Yes Kind of but its not working ... Main problem with my bot is path finding&#160;:-(
 JBM: A brings B to 0, then triggers mine and falls to -1
 JBM: what's the match outcome?
 eulerscheZahl: 2nd question: do you have a killer move when you can enforce a victory?
 eulerscheZahl: that helps quite a bit
 mark7: no..
 mark7: Like optracked, or silencing to go near opponent?
 eulerscheZahl: see how i win in the first game. i don't even know exactly where you are. but i know that i win
 mark7: eulerscheZahl No I dont have that
 mark7: Added in todo list to implement
 eulerscheZahl: add it. that's my advice
 eulerscheZahl: low hanging fruits
 mark7: Hehe!

 eulerscheZahl: dude...
 eulerscheZahl: it's a contest, don't share code
 pb4: brb, let me put this into my code :D
 mark7: Its already mess
 mark7: pb4 it wont help you much&#160;:-)
 pb4: "JBM 21H09A brings B to 0, then triggers mine and falls to -1what's the match outcome?"
 pb4: A wins
 pb4: game stops as soon as one player is down to 0
 JBM: kthx
 JBM: i recqll their was some kinf od ambiguity as to how turns split, but i can't get it back
 JBM: that's way too many typos, lemme try again
 JBM: i recall their was some kind of ambiguity as to how turns split, but i can't get it back
 mark7: Silver #2 Timesout as soon as I use Silence , Still at 2 position 
 eulerscheZahl: then that bot is doing something else much better than you are

 DEIZ21: your bot knew where mine was it moved and charged torpedo but didnt fired
 DEIZ21: you need to fix this
 YannT: yo kovi, back in the game&#160;:)
 DEIZ21: frame 240
 mark7: DEIZ21 Submitted another bot try that
 Illedan: Is the top real? Or does it feel random?
 Illedan: (ranks)
 kovi: real with uncertainty of 3-5
 chucknorris: +- 1 point
 kovi: yesterday i was around 5, no around 2
 Illedan: Same code?
 wlesavo: i liked pb4's submit today
 MadKnight: hey Illedan do setters in c# return value&#160;?
 MadKnight: do they return value or they call getter&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: yesterday he did it on his own
 eulerscheZahl: had a broken bot this morning
 Illedan: Setters do not return
 kovi: nah, i had promising improvement. i submit multiple times to be sure
 Illedan: aiit
 wlesavo: no i mean when he was 2 points above top#2
 Illedan: Looking forward to legend
 Illedan: more game
 MadKnight: so u can't do var x = obj.Prop = 3; ?
 Illedan: s
 Illedan: Sure, if it has a getter
 MadKnight: so it just calls getter&#160;?
 MadKnight: and it doesn't reuse value passed to setter&#160;?
 eulerscheZahl: you can have a property with getter and setter
 eulerscheZahl: a setter doesn't have to call anything as it doesn't return a value
 MadKnight: but will it use Prop's getter&#160;?
 Illedan: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://tech.io/snippet/OOaIxK7">https://tech.io/snippet/OOaIxK7</a>
 MadKnight: oh
 kovi: 35.59
 kovi: now that is lucky rolls
 struct: is the luck on the enemy you get?
 struct: or on the maps?
 pb4: wlesavo&#160;: I repushed the same code right after that, was #5
 wlesavo: pb4 yeah, but was nice for a sec :slight_smile:
 JBM: pb4: were your answers to me "statement says so" or "referee says so"?
 pb4: None of the above
 pb4: Referee author says so
 pb4: :D
 JBM: could be mistaken
 JBM: wouldn't be a first
 pb4: right. Since I do not intend to stand on a mine and trigger it when I've won, I decided not to investigate more
 JBM: sounds qbout right
 JBM: $% ^&amp;* knd layoutsb
 JBM: (*kbd layouts)
 dbdr: referee checks victory condition after every frame
 JBM: that's a better argument
 JBM: not that i know what a frame means, but i can kinda infer
 struct: 1 frame = 1 action
 struct: MOVE N TORPEDO | TORPEDO x y | SILENCE N 0should be 3 frames
 JBM: That's better
 JBM: you guys rock
 dbdr: :guitar:

 dbdr: I did wonder if you could surface, get to 0, and still kill your opponent to get a draw :D
 dbdr: my conlusion was that you can't
 DEIZ21: guys what s better than fluidfill for this bot?
 JBM: (ahmerdecestpaslebon)
 JBM: like, anything
 JBM: maybe this one <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7z1PuDRCko">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7z1PuDRCko</a>
 JBM: tea much better
 JBM: *yea
 dbdr: alternative rickroll?
 JBM: so much better 'an a rr
 DEIZ21: what can i implement instead of fluidfill?
 dbdr: DEIZ21 I was top 10 with a floodfill
 ZarthaxX: not only a floodfill i guess dbdr lol
 DEIZ21: cool but i think i'm  found verry offen du to my movement
 ZarthaxX: also some search mixed
 DEIZ21: exact Zart
 JBM: the word on the streen right here today was hamiltonian paths
 JBM: *st
 ZarthaxX: what?
 ZarthaxX: hamiltonian paths for this?
 dbdr: that won't take care of being discovered, will it?
 dbdr: actually makes it "easier"
 dbdr: theoretically
 ZarthaxX: tru
 ZarthaxX: dbdr doing search or wont talk? :P
 dbdr: I'm doing some kind of search, yes
 ZarthaxX: i see
 ZarthaxX: tried  smth but possible sequences of actions exploded
 mark7: When you make a move do you only calculate one move ahead or how many move ahead?
 dbdr: you could always go the way of recurse in his locam stream, MC
 dbdr: or prune
 ZarthaxX: oh.. tru
 ZarthaxX: i can check that, thought it would miss key moves
 JBM: anything predictable makes it more likely to be discovered
 JBM: just have enough alternatives and pick at (unpredictable) random
 ZarthaxX: lol the way to go JBM
 JBM: one of'em
 reCurse: What did I do
 dbdr: locam stream
 JBM: the bitstream stuff?
 JBM: man, i still hear about that now
 reCurse: No he actually talks about MC
 dbdr: yeah, but not that
 reCurse: Which is the part no one actually remembers
 reCurse: So I'm surprised
 dbdr: crazy right?
 JBM: who knew
 dbdr: wow, I found the winner of the contest
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/446916405">https://www.codingame.com/replay/446916405</a>
 dbdr: frame 322
 wlesavo: if he would also surface and triggered that turn i would agree
 dbdr: ah true, not complete
 dbdr: who'll take the challenge?
 JBM: just do it
 dbdr: it's more impressive if it happens without planning it
 inoryy: what am I looking at there, the fakeout trigger?
 dbdr: bonus points for 4 damage and victory on the turn
 JBM: who are we to decide that
 dbdr: all powers used in a single turn
 Illedan: This is why we dissalowed triggering on the same turn as dropping a mine :P
 DEIZ21: :D
 JBM: well, move's not really a power is it
 JBM: didi say say anything sensible recently? carry on
 icecream17: well, the only way to charge is by moving
 Astrobytes: On the rum again JBM? :D
 JBM: not tonight, thx for asking
 Astrobytes: :P
 JBM: well not right now anyway
 JBM: sharing :beers: with the good folks on #Fr
 Astrobytes: Santé
 JBM: noice
 JBM: how are you even allowed to do that
 Astrobytes: What, use a French word in World?
 JBM: shame on you
 JBM: you should see the CM when we dare use some anglicism on #Fr
 Astrobytes: Yeah I've dropped a few English words in #Fr once in a while, it's such a French response :D
 Astrobytes: *words/phrases
 JBM: naw, you're way below the threshold
 Zenoscave: Do you guys look ahead more than one move for mine avoidance?
 Zenoscave: or path finding even
 ghassen: the further u see the better, usually 
 Astrobytes: JBM has anyone ever used "possiblement" in #Fr? :D
 JBM: nope
 JBM: we say "eventuellement" for that
 JBM: one of the greatest source of en/fr confusion ever
 Astrobytes: lol, good. No I know, it's just a lot of my French colleagues back when I was in London used to confuse their relatives on the phone by using it
 Astrobytes: Too Anglicised you see
 JBM: eventually, actually
 JBM: top false friends
 Astrobytes: Possibly
 JBM: possibly isn't really in french
 Astrobytes: Yes, that's the point
 JBM: yup
 Astrobytes: "possiblement" "huh?" "PUTAIN. Fucking English"
 Astrobytes: Frequently heard phone conversations
 Astrobytes: Never mix with the English speakers. It will ruin you.

 aCat: really 
 Astrobytes: hehehe
 aCat: believe this cat, this cat is an honest programmer
 Jlivingstonsg: I have join codingame because I found a DOS game  called BlockOut from 1989 that we played and today you can play it in your browser.  But I have still not found a version that can register points on a global database so that is what I plan to do.  Does anybody here know about BlockOut?  Its a 3D Tetris 
 aCat: LOCM acc was made for the stream purposes - I just now fiound the way to use it 
 Astrobytes: Yeah I know, all good :D
 struct: Jlivingstonsg I just checked
 Astrobytes: Jlivingstonsg have you seen the codingame SDK for creating games?
 struct: The problem for me with games like tetris on CG
 struct: is that on tetris pieces start moving after some time
 struct: For example on 1vs1 tetris
 struct: you can place 3 pieces and enemy 0
 Jlivingstonsg: I will check SDK later
 struct: here is link if you want to save <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775">https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775</a>
 Jlivingstonsg: Google:   blockout online    and try one in your browser
 struct: Do you want to make it a solo player game?
 struct: single*
 Astrobytes: I know it, not sure if it would be a viable game for CG purposes but do feel free to try
 Jlivingstonsg: I am just here to practice coding.  If it is possible to code BlockOut here then I will have a go at it here.
 Astrobytes: struct, how's your OoC?
 struct: Im not doing it astro
 Astrobytes: Not feeling it?
 struct: yeah
 JBM: afraid are you
 struct: Im just not good at these types of games
 struct: So I dont even try
 Astrobytes: I'm not massively into it myself but I'm gonna try a bit now I'm feeling better
 Astrobytes: Spent some time refactoring so at least I got rid of the mess and can do something!
 struct: what league are you in atm»
 Astrobytes: Silver
 icecream17: MESSAAAAGE! :smile:
 JBM: well get crack'n
 Astrobytes: Didn't submit for a couple of days until tonight, and gained 150+ places
 Astrobytes: yes icecream17 :D
 Jlivingstonsg: Its quite fun. I work as math and physics teacher on high level and I always challenge students on schools in BlockOut/Out of control and they have no chance.  I am 56 now and have score over 100.000 points and kids today that play games all the time can often never get over 20000 points.   I thouught kids today were professional gamers but in spatial thinking they really suck....   :)   
 JBM: what points?
 Astrobytes: JBM BlockOut (3d tetris)
 JBM: oh wow
 JBM: that's, like, Old
 Astrobytes: Yup
 JBM: i loved that game
 Astrobytes: Think it's doable with the CG SDK?
 JBM: nope
 struct: too much work
 JBM: too 2d-centric
 JFB: Jlivingstonsg&#160;:-) At least sb older that me (I'm 55) 
 Astrobytes: That's what I thought too
 Astrobytes: Ah, I feel so young now at 38
 struct: And I feel like is under impression that here you code games
 struct: :p
 Astrobytes: That too struct
 JBM: naw, nobody writes those
 JBM: they just come out of the ther
 JBM: *ether
 JBM: come ON kbd, what's with ya tonight
 Astrobytes: PEBKAC
 Astrobytes: :P
 JBM: trying to push it lower
 JBM: but it comes back biting me
 DEIZ21: Astrobytes  refactoring is never bad thiing; i just finished refactoring my code and guess what?! i found a bunsh of ugly stupid bugs, i fixed them and submited. i didnt add any new feature and guess what? i gained 50+ in rank from 135 to 82 for naw
 JBM: err... lol
 JBM: refactoring can totally be bad thing
 DEIZ21: true
 JBM: one anecdote doesn't a rule make
 DEIZ21: actually i began yesterday
 Astrobytes: absolutely
 DEIZ21: bad went in bad direction and was tired
 Astrobytes: But I spent 2 days and tested everything
 JBM: you could also have introduced a new bug
 JBM: that happened to cancel one of the old ones
 DEIZ21: so i restarted fresh today and kept it simple
 JBM: no generalization holds
 DEIZ21: no reason to make complexe things
 JBM: yeah, no ruls there
 JBM: show me your code and/or stream, i'll tell ya
 JBM: Astrobytes: same for you ;p
 DEIZ21: i was upset telling my self poeple are adding new stuff and features and i'm loosing my time on refactoring
 DEIZ21: but as i said it was totally worth it
 Astrobytes: I would be deeply ashamed to code on stream lolMight sell you it for 5 euro though :P
 JBM: why the shame?
 JBM: everybody's got to learn fro; everybody
 Astrobytes: DEIZ21 I've been ill so taken me some time to do it, but definitely worth the effort
 Astrobytes: Would be a very long stream JBM :D
 DEIZ21: exact
 DEIZ21: typing like ..
 DEIZ21: a dumb
 JBM: that's the fun of it
 JBM: i still got no idea how twitch thinks 626 people watched my stuff
 JBM: probably not paying enough
 DEIZ21: jbm search for illedan
 JBM: why?
 DEIZ21: he streamed the basic things
 JBM: i listened to it
 DEIZ21: he type quicker than i could speak :D
 JBM: was too seesharpy for me
 Astrobytes: lol
 JBM: nope that'd be errichto
 DEIZ21: me too
 DEIZ21: thx for the creator of pause/play :p
 JBM: then again errichto didn't go that high
 DEIZ21: who?
 struct: he only coded for a few hours though
 JBM: illedan moreso, but twas too long for me to listen to the whole of it
 DEIZ21: errichto
 Astrobytes: I can type quick, but as a biologist streaming programming I'd feel like an impostor, frankly
 struct: his youtube channel is getting quite big
 JBM: wouldn't be
 JBM: * not that many real "this is all i cna do" programmer people exist anyway
 JBM: * rankings matter a helluva lot more
 JBM: gtg spk to ya tomorrow
 DEIZ21: guys i need a more efficient way to move
 DEIZ21: now i m using fluidfill
 DEIZ21: any idea?
 Astrobytes: gn JBM
 Astrobytes: I'm still using floodfill DEIZ21
 Astrobytes: But you're gold right?
 DEIZ21: yeh
 DEIZ21: they told me there is a better way
 DEIZ21: but didnt indcate any thing
 Astrobytes: I'd be looking at moving either away from or towards the enemy, based on your tracking 
 Astrobytes: So, generating possible paths
 Astrobytes: (for the enemy)
 Astrobytes: And moving based on that
 DEIZ21: how do you type with red
 DEIZ21: cant mention any person here
 DEIZ21: how the hell
 Astrobytes: DEIZ21 Type the whole username, or the first few letters + TAB
 DEIZ21: Astrobytes ah that was th tab the missing thing 
 DEIZ21: doesnt work
 Astrobytes: That worked
 DEIZ21: ah
 DEIZ21: ok work only for the person?
 DEIZ21: not stupid
 Astrobytes: It's only red if someone tags your nick
 DEIZ21: k thx
 Astrobytes: no worries&#160;:)
 AntiSquid: look at SuperNit's messages :D
 AntiSquid: silly
 Astrobytes: Quoting Portal no?
 kovi: 36.74
 struct: Seems the margin is getting higher
 DEIZ21: how adding 3 chars in the code could make u loose 100 in ranking :p
 struct: What are these chars?
 DEIZ21: d&gt;3
 icecream17: ugh. this random person in 438th somehow always exploits obscure hard to find bugs in my code
 icecream17: yes! I used cg sync! should've pressed that obvious button earlier

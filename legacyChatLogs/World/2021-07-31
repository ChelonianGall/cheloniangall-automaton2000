 dbdr: Maxim251, why do you do         left.layer = layer;it seems to undo the increment in the constructor
 Thyl: Hello
 Thyl: Do you know link for learn MaxN
 Thyl: I want to do a search algorithm in Tron
 jrke: MaxN is just minimax for more than 2 players

 Maxim251: @dbdr I try pass number to child node. But later I figureout that I can do it by class constructor.
 Maxim251: Interesting aproach of not using pointers, is that each node is created only for time of calculation, and when it finish work in that node, it is deleted, and previouse node open next child, do stuff, and is deleted, then higher node also is deleted, because he do his job. 
 jacek: :thinking:
 Maxim251: With this tree aproach, I save memory for tree, because only one branche is created, and deleted before creating next one.... 
 Maxim251: But what You can recive is only return value, 
 Maxim251: With pointers and new keyword, I have alll branch tree in memory, and is acces to each of node seperatlly... Thats the pluses and minuses
 Maxim251: And in the end, I need care to delete all branch.
 Maxim251: my self..
 Maxim251: I found nice tutorial about binary search... <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nCDvuNOWNU&amp;list=PLTxllHdfUq4d-DE16EDkpeb8Z68DU7Z_Q&amp;index=6">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nCDvuNOWNU&amp;list=PLTxllHdfUq4d-DE16EDkpeb8Z68DU7Z_Q&amp;index=6</a>
 Maxim251: is totally different approach then my thinking.

 struct: on the best cpu though
 jacek: oO

 jacek: think smarter not harder

 Astrobytes: leaderboards frozen?
 Astrobytes: battles still go on and submits complete but leaderboard seems stuck
 struct: seems so
 struct: last battles not showing
 struct: on bots that are on a current submit
 Astrobytes: Reported
 SoWhatMan: Reported?
 SoWhatMan: where?
 Astrobytes: Bug Report channel on the Discord
 SoWhatMan: thank youi
 Maxim251: Now I understand treesearch, its is all about calling function of it self. this way I can go deep in to tree , and also get back return type from de last node to the beggining :D
 jacek: :tada:
 MSmits: that's mostly about understanding recursion in general, but sure, treesearch as well
 Maxim251: What I was missing was in this function void check_for_avaible_move() - input from curent node, and in side of that function call void check_for_avaible_move(node-&gt;next)
 Maxim251: My mistake was also creating functions in side of class, where after watching tutorial, I see I dont need do that. Class, node is only container and it can be called from function of itself to create levels. 
 Maxim251: UFFF.. 
 MSmits: yeah sometimes it's convenient to make class functions
 MSmits: sometimes not
 struct: are you still working on d&amp;b MSmits?
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: recoded my entire scoresolver yesterday after i found some wrong assumptions
 MSmits: works well it seems
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/573246937">https://www.codingame.com/replay/573246937</a>
 MSmits: solves at frame 49 for score in this case
 MSmits: and only goes up as mikla makes it worse
 MSmits: still debugging though, won't submit yet
 struct: damn
 MSmits: it's completely bitboarded now. No more graphs
 MSmits: I merged the two negamaxes i had for it
 MSmits: just 1 now
 MSmits: eliminated 1000 lines of code too
 MSmits: 3.9k to 2.9k
 MSmits: it's still bloated because it has a mcts, a nim solver and a score solver
 Astrobytes: doesn't matter if you submit, leaderboards are frozen
 MSmits: oh, why are they frozen?
 Astrobytes: No idea
 martinpapa69: you still can get your actual score from replays
 Astrobytes: yeah
 MSmits: you mean you can still use the IDE&#160;?
 Astrobytes: ofc
 Astrobytes: You can submit, battles go, but leaderboard doesn't update
 martinpapa69: you open a replay, you see your elo
 MSmits: ohhh ok
 MSmits: so it's a visual bug for the leaderboard?
 Astrobytes: I don't know
 Astrobytes: Been reported. no one seems to have seen it yet
 martinpapa69: ye, your elo updates, but there is something with the lb view
 jacek: maybe it was friday evening update
 jacek: (again)
 Astrobytes: lol
 NguyenVinhHien: the server is tired on the weekend&#160;:))
 eulerscheZahl: the classic friday afternoon release :D
 MSmits: I wonder what they were *trying* to do though
 jacek: nerf d&amp;b
 MSmits:&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Na, Tibo broke the whole architecture removing my mods rights. CG classic side effects. :smirk:
 MSmits: why were your mod rights removed?
 eulerscheZahl: oh, you already lost your badge here on chat. that was quick
 BlaiseEbuth: Oh, he did it right after.
 eulerscheZahl: somehow i thought it would be more complicated for the chat
 <b>**eulerscheZahl feels terrible&#160;:(</b>
 BlaiseEbuth: Because I was spoiling the nice and shiny CG's public image MSmits.
 MSmits: aha
 jacek: and mk doesnt?
 MSmits: mk is banned 
 MSmits: afaik
 jacek: oh my
 Illedan: Yo!
 BlaiseEbuth: By me, not CG.
 jacek: oO
 BlaiseEbuth: Harass people by DM doesn't affect the public image of CG.
 KiwiTae: o/
 BlaiseEbuth: \o
 BlaiseEbuth: It's not complicated for the chat eulerscheZahl, you just need to renew the site's certificates. :rofl:

 eulerscheZahl: got it yesterday
 MSmits: my wife felt bad for 3 days also
 MSmits: 4 almost
 struct: I should take mine in 2 weeks
 struct: finally
 MSmits: mine in 12 days
 struct: my first dose
 MSmits: wow first
 reCurse: No side effects here
 MSmits: lucky
 MSmits: or maybe not
 eulerscheZahl: great, take it. better sick for a few days than the risk of the actual desease
 MSmits: maybe side effects is a sign it's working well
 MSmits: hard to say
 MSmits: eulerscheZahl yes, the people who i've known that got actual covid didnt get hospitalized but were still sicker than the side effects you would get
 BlaiseEbuth: My second dose was OK. Just a little tired.
 eulerscheZahl: i got tired yesterday evening (even earlier than my usual time)
 eulerscheZahl: then some pain in my limbs at night, which is mostly gone again already
 MSmits: sounds typical
 MSmits: i was unlucky with 1st shot, could not move 1 arm all day
 eulerscheZahl: but this time my arm doesn't hurt and I can sleep on the side \o/
 MSmits: ah nice
 MSmits: that sucks 
 MSmits: not sleeping on 1 side
 MSmits: I could not even put my coat on without great effort
 RohitKaushal: how do i create a custom game to play with friends here..?

 eulerscheZahl: or there
 RohitKaushal: ‚ù§,
 eulerscheZahl: so many ways
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm...How do you handle collisions with goals poles in FB? I mean for the bounce. Infinite mass for the pole?
 eulerscheZahl: sounds like what I would do (i don't have much of a simulation)
 KiwiTae: BlaiseEbuth yes so it doesnt move~
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth doesn't the referee tell you how this is calculated?
 MSmits: you can probably simplify the calculation a lot
 BlaiseEbuth: Is there a referee&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah 
 MSmits: someone will link i
 MSmits: it
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/dreignier/fantastic-bits/blob/master/fantastic-bits.cpp#L624">https://github.com/dreignier/fantastic-bits/blob/master/fantastic-bits.cpp#L624</a>

 MSmits: but as i said, because the mass is infinite, there will probably some unnecessary calculation steps
 eulerscheZahl: the official referee
 reCurse: Just don't update it...
 struct: yeah thats what I do
 struct: dont change pos or vel of the pole
 jacek:  
 BlaiseEbuth: For the pole Ok. But doesn't the pole mass has an effect on the other entity? (Blaise and physic...)
 MSmits: yeah and there is probably some division in there. Which you can ignore because you divide by infinite -&gt; = 0
 struct: its not moving
 jacek: :rage:
 MSmits: but check it as a coder, not as a physicist. Put in the infinite mass and see what the calculation does. 
 reCurse: What's the mass of a wall?
 MSmits: infinite 
 jacek: what if infinite force hits it?
 struct: you break the wall
 reCurse: Does it have a mass is more the question
 BlaiseEbuth: Another break in the wall.
 MSmits: well in the way it's coded it might have a mass, but then you can simplify the calculation so it doesn't
 struct: does it matter at all if it has mass? It cant move.
 struct: But im not very good at physics
 reCurse: That's my point
 reCurse: If you don't worry about mass for walls
 reCurse: Why do you worry about mass for posts
 MSmits: you shouldn't
 BlaiseEbuth: Haven't considered the walls yet, so..
 MSmits: the collision could be different, but not mass related
 MSmits: just the direction of bounce
 BlaiseEbuth: My only concern was about the use of the mass in the calculation of the other entity vector, but you're right, the mass disapear with simplification.
 BlaiseEbuth: Thanks.

 BlaiseEbuth: Well, I gonna say that's "yes". Will not search for hours. -_-
 MSmits: ja_fica I don't think i currently use avx in uttt
 MSmits: there's not many opportunities for it
 MSmits: I tried 2 things
 MSmits: avx wincheck, was slightly slower than 512-sized array lookup
 MSmits: parallelized inverse squareroot for UCB1
 MSmits: was also slower
 MSmits: than just doing a fast sqrt
 struct: I tried parallelized ucb for c4 yesterday
 MSmits: parallizing the sim is pretty much impossible
 struct: I got same speed&#160;:(
 MSmits: ahh
 69razer69: whats 5% of 5025
 ja_fica: yes fast sqrt cant be done in avx
 struct: but I do something awfull to get status of the node
 struct: to check if its solved or not
 struct: avx2 doesnt have gather for 8 bytes
 struct: So I need to do this
 BlaiseEbuth: The 5% are the competitors 69razer69
 struct: const __m256 status = _mm256_cvtepi32_ps(_mm256_srli_epi32(_mm256_i32gather_epi32(&amp;nodes[nodes[current_node].first_child].score, _mm256_setr_epi32(7, 23, 39, 55, 71, 87, 103, 119), 1), 24));
 struct: I get a previous variable that is 4 bytes
 struct: then select the next 7 bytes instead
 struct: but it will grab 4 bytes in total
 struct: So I have to shift by right :D
 MSmits: seems complicated
 MSmits: ja_fica

 MSmits: those are some basic functions i use in many bots

 MSmits: if you know one that beats any of them let me know
 dbdr: now we know your secret seed&#160;;)
 ja_fica: unions in AVX requires changing the type of the variable
 MSmits: that is the seed i used to beat remi :P
 ja_fica: xorshift&#160;?
 struct: counter seeding
 struct: how dare you
 struct: uint32_t seed = time(NULL);
 MSmits: xorshift is an easy way to get reasonably good hash keys
 ja_fica: nice

 MSmits: h and v are horizontal and verticla lines
 MSmits: i xorshift the h
 MSmits: can also do both
 MSmits: but 1 works fine in this case
 ja_fica: you dont store log and sqrt results in precomputed values?
 MSmits: heh, that's a sad story
 MSmits: I used to always do that
 MSmits: and searched forever for a way to stop, because it's so annoying
 MSmits: but never found a faster way
 ja_fica: yes
 MSmits: it's really annoying because you need to artificially cap it
 struct: I also stopped doing it
 struct: its not worth
 MSmits: too many sims and you crash
 ja_fica: I prefer thomson sampling focer UCT
 MSmits: what does that do
 ja_fica: over*
 MSmits: and why prefer?
 ja_fica: its a better formula to converge into better results in less rollouts
 MSmits: why doesnt everyone use that?
 ja_fica: the problem is that the math to calculate it is slower
 MSmits: I see
 ja_fica: leads to less rollouts
 eulerscheZahl: my rollouts are low for other reasons already
 ja_fica: and you cannot precompute it all
 eulerscheZahl: thus some more math is ok
 MSmits: so it's worth it when the random sim, or your eval is very slow and selection is not a bottleneck
 struct: This is why I have lots of rollouts
 struct: i dont use UCT
 Astrobytes: if the tradeoff is worth it then I guess it works
 MSmits: what do you use?
 BlaiseEbuth: I use the force.
 dbdr: always select child 0. it's fast!
 struct: rand()
 MSmits:&#160;??
 Astrobytes: I use the Schwartz
 eulerscheZahl: you do completely random rollouts struct?

 MSmits: i think it was called Edax
 MSmits: not sure
 MSmits: you can find that on github
 struct: thanks Ill check it MSmits

 MSmits: edax is a giant rabbit hole btw. It also uses that stuff dbd r uses
 MSmits: dbd r is the strongest non-NN bot I think
 Astrobytes: multi probcut
 MSmits: yes that
 MSmits: though it's very similar to working with a NN as he also trained 300k params or something
 jrke: finally i pruned and optimized my solver
 MSmits: cool
 jrke: and added something in early game to keep less chains
 MSmits: it needs to be used later too, i found, most of the formation of loops and such happens between frame 40 and 55 i noticed in games vs Marchete
 jrke: but still i take lot of time to solve
 MSmits: do you hash?
 MSmits: and use ab&#160;?
 jrke: transpotion tables are there but the problem is no bitboards
 MSmits: oh i see
 MSmits: mine is now completely bitboarded
 jrke: i represent a state by a string of lenght 196
 MSmits: a string!
 jrke: which is very heavy
 MSmits: strings are very very slow
 jrke: yeah ik
 MSmits: my state is two uint64_t
 jrke: there are few more things like that need to optimized
 MSmits: one for vertical and one for horizontal lines
 jrke: yeah you told that
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39779f06-d32e-4b49-8fa4-acccf5bd8b50">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/39779f06-d32e-4b49-8fa4-acccf5bd8b50</a>
 MSmits: lower and upper are for storing lower and upper limits in TT
 jrke: grt
 MSmits: when they are equal, it's an exact value
 jrke: i have introduced some bug during optimization lol
 MSmits: the difficult part of using ab + TT is the turns when you have to choose to keep control or take the boxes
 jrke: look at output
 jrke: G7 R MSG 53 - -4 = WIN
 MSmits: all boxes&#160;?
 jrke: my best score = 53opp best score = -4
 jrke: lol
 MSmits: seems like sign error somewhere
 jrke: not all boxes its bug
 jrke: yes looks like that only
 MSmits: btw i made too many assumptions in my earlier solvers
 MSmits: some exceptions in 1 out of 1000+ cases
 MSmits: the only two assumptions you can really make is that smaller chains are better than longer chains and smaller loops are better than longer loops. To offer i mean
 MSmits: but a 2 chain isnt even always better than a 3 chain, apparently
 jrke: yes that what i pruned from yesterday
 MSmits: only when it's a simple loony endgame
 jrke: smallest chain and loop
 MSmits: yes but make an example for chain1  and chain 2
 MSmits: chain 1 is always better than 2
 MSmits: but 2 is not always better than 3 
 MSmits: because 3 has the control switch option
 MSmits: and intuitively i assume that always makes it a worse move than 2
 MSmits: but it doesn't
 MSmits: only on simple loony endgames
 jrke: that chain 2 also have control switch if you do not play middle line
 MSmits: sure, ok, but don't do that&#160;:)
 MSmits: not playing middle line is a loony move
 MSmits: always bad
 MSmits: anyways those cases where playing 3 chain is better than offering 1 or 2 are super rare
 jrke: in that case even god wants you to lose lol
 MSmits: probably
 MSmits: I think these are cases where the winner is already decided and you're just trying to get the best margin of score
 jrke: ah
 MSmits: but it's hard to say anything for sure. I just try each assumption with million + randomly generated boards
 MSmits: with and without the assumption they should all have the same result
 jrke: yes
 MSmits: otherwise it's a bad assumption
 MSmits: but many of these assumptions are mostly good except in 7 cases or something.... out of a million
 jrke: do you have any assumptions for non loony games
 jrke: i mean having joints
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: well yes, but very few
 MSmits: isolated 1 chain always better than isolated 2 chain
 MSmits: only play smallest chain that is 3 or larger
 MSmits: so dont play 4 if there's a 3
 MSmits: same for loops
 MSmits: play 4 if there's also a 6 or 8
 MSmits: for stuff that's connected to joins you can do the following
 MSmits: if there's a grounded 1 chain and a grounded 2 chain connected to the same join, play the 1
 MSmits: same for larger chains, play 3 instead of 4 or 5
 MSmits: if connected to join and otherwise grounded
 MSmits: but dont play 1 instead of 3... that's uncertain
 jrke: ohk
 MSmits: i dont use these join-rules in my current solver
 MSmits: but they are correct
 jrke: is there any formula which directly calculates loony games value?
 MSmits: it takes a lot of calculation to check for this and i am currently unsure how to do it with bitboard
 jrke: just having loops of all size and closed chains
 MSmits: jrke yes but only if there are no joins
 jrke: yeah only loony
 MSmits: i shared it before didnt i?
 jrke: closed chains and loops
 jrke: i think it was just for loop of size 4 right?
 MSmits: no
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3536899d-1ad3-4f09-9e70-e9ab1aa0699f">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/3536899d-1ad3-4f09-9e70-e9ab1aa0699f</a>
 MSmits: for all loops and all chains
 jrke: this one^
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: ll means looplong
 MSmits: so 6 and 8 and 10 etc.
 MSmits: cl means chainlong
 MSmits: it doesnt matter how long, just long
 MSmits: &gt;3 for chains
 MSmits: &gt;4 for loops
 jrke: so its ll is count of loops or count of boxes present in all loops?
 MSmits: count of long loops
 MSmits: the boxes are also taken into account
 MSmits: but thats in the other variable
 MSmits: "b"
 jrke: so l4 = count of loop4 ll = count loop&gt;4
 MSmits: it matters that you have to give up 2 boxes twice
 MSmits: not how the boxes are distributed over the long chains
 MSmits: yes jrke
 jrke: c3?
 MSmits: chain of 3 length
 jrke: ohk
 MSmits: cl is the rest of the chains, longer than 3
 jrke: cl means &gt;3 
 jrke: ohk
 MSmits: yes
 jrke: and what about chains &lt; 3
 MSmits: i take them into account separately, sec
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f49d174-c9aa-474b-a964-4cc34d5f2d7b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/4f49d174-c9aa-474b-a964-4cc34d5f2d7b</a>
 MSmits: chaincount[0] are chains of length 1
 MSmits: chaincount[1] are chains of length 2
 MSmits: it's a bit poorly coded
 jrke: np
 jrke: and what does b denotes for
 MSmits: i have a better version now, but it doesnt combine with the other function i shared
 MSmits: boxcount
 jrke: or what is it for
 jrke: boxcount of what?
 MSmits: just how many boxes unfilled
 MSmits: uncaptured
 jrke: in complete board?
 MSmits: int boxes = c.c8.boxCount - totalShortBoxes;
 jrke: having all loops and all chains
 MSmits: boxcount is the total boxcount left
 jrke: ohk
 MSmits: boxes is the total boxcount left minus the short chain boxes
 MSmits: the weird c.c8 naming is because of the union i used before
 jrke: so
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d186089-ba7f-4a4f-8a10-d6883bec7fca">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/2d186089-ba7f-4a4f-8a10-d6883bec7fca</a>
 jrke: this func is enought to get value of loony games
 MSmits: no
 MSmits: you need the giant one
 MSmits: it's calling that one
 MSmits: thats the controlled value
 MSmits: not the exact game value
 jrke: oh yes
 MSmits: the controllled value is the value of the game when you never give up control
 MSmits: sometimes it is beneficial to give up control
 MSmits: thats what the giant function determines
 jrke: oh
 MSmits: btw it's large, but it's not slow
 jrke: yeah i can see
 MSmits: i created a 6k array lookup to replace both those functions
 jrke: if else and maths
 MSmits: and it was slower
 jrke: c.c8.loopCount[1]
 MSmits: that's a chain of length 2
 jrke: is this loop of size of 6?
 MSmits: oh
 MSmits: wait
 MSmits: yes
 MSmits: loopcount[0] and loopcount[1] are loops of 4 and 6 yes
 jrke: and c.c8.loopLongCount loops bigger than 6 or 4?
 MSmits: yes
 jrke: &gt;6 i guess
 MSmits: but for the function it doesnt matter if they are 6 or 8
 MSmits: thats why 6 is added to looplong
 MSmits: it did matter for other things, or so i thought
 jrke: so you add 2times loop chains
 jrke: of size 6
 MSmits: no 1 time
 MSmits: te looplongcount does not contain loops of 6
 jrke: ah my bad
 MSmits: so i need to add them before using the function
 jrke: i misunderstood
 MSmits: this is because my previous solver had a special case for loops of 6
 jrke: oh
 jrke: is this from kevin buzzard paper?
 jrke: or your own mind
 jrke:&#160;?
 MSmits: yes this whole function comes from there
 jrke: oh
 MSmits: i took all his rules and put them in
 jrke: grtt
 MSmits: you can even check the comments, it says "theorem 10" and all that
 jrke: even i read that pdf many times but never understood completely
 jrke: now it looks understandable
 jrke: thanks
 MSmits: well the rules should be understandable
 MSmits: the proofs are a different thing
 MSmits: dont worry too much about those
 MSmits: np
 jrke: values are me-opp right?
 dbdr: what if you find a mistake in the proofs though?&#160;;)
 MSmits: they are the net score of the rest of the game
 MSmits: so say there are 30 boxes left
 MSmits: and the value is +2
 jrke: got it
 MSmits: then you will get 16, he will get 14
 jrke: my value = 30+2/2opp value = 30-2/2
 MSmits: that's quick
 MSmits: need some parenthesis but damn
 MSmits: quick study
 jrke: yeah
 MSmits: dbdr if there are errors I will see it on the leaderboard&#160;:)
 dbdr:&#160;:)
 jacek: hm?
 MSmits: btw jrke there's two parts to this
 MSmits: 1 is determining the value of the game
 MSmits: most important for the solver
 MSmits: but 2 is getting the actual  move out of a simple loony endgame
 jrke: and another?fetching best move?
 MSmits: there's also rules for that in the paper
 jrke: np i will read it again
 jrke: btw Aug 18, 2020 8:14:45 AM - first time when i submitted bot for D&amp;B
 jrke: its soon going to be an year
 MSmits: yes almost a year ago
 MSmits: 7% of your life
 jrke: :grin:
 MSmits: you're the craziest 14 yr old i have ever met. But jealous about what you can do that that age
 MSmits: it's amazing
 Astrobytes: +1
 jrke: lol
 MSmits: I think when i was your age I was trying to save princess Zelda
 MSmits: also important, but still
 jrke: :relieved:
 jrke: world changes!
 MSmits: there's still people of that age trying to save princess Zelda though
 jacek: the future is now old man
 jacek: and they think zelda is that green guy :unamused:
 MSmits: thats Link!
 Astrobytes: link?
 dbdr: Startrek
 Astrobytes: jeez, surely they can't get those two mixed up
 jacek: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxqLsrlakK8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxqLsrlakK8</a>
 MSmits: yes the elf main character
 Astrobytes: I know who Link is!!!
 MSmits: lol
 dbdr: :D
 MSmits: haha jacek, i didnt get rickrolled. I got an ad :P
 MSmits: jokes on you
 MSmits: and me for watching that ad
 Astrobytes: I don't click his youtube links
 MSmits: wise
 jrke: my time to sleep
 jrke: b-bye gn
 MSmits: gn jrke
 Astrobytes: gn jrke, take care
 jrke: stay safe!
 reCurse: Today in AI news: AI develops hubris, promotes 4 knights in a row to troll the opponent and fails to find the mate on a lone king.
 MSmits: lol
 Astrobytes: :D
 dbdr: way to go!
 jacek: hubris?
 reCurse: I wish I was joking :sweat:
 MSmits: it's more funny if you're not :P
 reCurse: It's funny until you try debugging it
 MSmits: true...
 reCurse: Well I could expand a queen promotion first
 MSmits: i have no idea how to debug something like that if it comes out of a NN eval
 reCurse: But where's the fun in that
 jacek: but how one can promote 4 things in a row
 MSmits: 4 diff pawns
 reCurse: Had 4 pawns left
 reCurse: Promoted them all to knights because reasons
 reCurse: Couldn't find the mate
 struct: opponent should have resigned
 reCurse: Because I only have 5 men TB
 MSmits: finding the mate is a hard thing in general for a NN. Because of the low search depth
 dbdr: apparently, no need to resign, it's a draw&#160;;)
 reCurse: It shouldn't be
 dbdr: obviously
 reCurse: No I mean
 reCurse: It shouldn't be a hard thing to find for a NN
 MSmits: i guess a good policy should help you
 reCurse: The concept of space should be helpful there
 MSmits: value network is useless for it
 reCurse: See the value was dropping over time
 reCurse: Because it saw the 50 move rising
 reCurse: So there was space for it to have a win except it didn't
 MSmits: oh 50 moves no capture
 reCurse: I barely understand how it's playing as it is
 jacek: dont we all
 reCurse: Minimax is just cold tactics
 reCurse: You can sort of reason around it
 MSmits: not when its results are based on action 10 turns deep
 MSmits: at least i cant
 reCurse: Yeah but it is still the best evaluation at a fixed depth
 MSmits: true
 reCurse: Like you know there's no other combination that scores higher
 reCurse: So you have some sort of fallback
 reCurse: If it didn't pick another line it's because its score was lower
 struct: could have been worse, it could have promoted to 4 same color bishops
 MSmits: but that should be the same for the NN
 reCurse: I still can't find an intuitive grasp on mcts and nn
 MSmits: oh right, mcts
 martinpapa69: NN is mAgIc
 MSmits: yeah mcts is tough like that
 jacek: friendship is magic
 jacek: therefore nn is firenship
 reCurse: So it's insanely difficult to debug
 ANONYMOUS42: ü§Ø
 MSmits: i think there are 2 separate issues though. First that you have mcts, that can cause you to miss traps and such and then the NN where you have no idea what the eval does
 reCurse: I mean it does some things right obviously
 reCurse: It's just very hard to follow
 MSmits: yea
 reCurse: I still intensely dislike the score average of mcts
 reCurse: But the value is too unstable to "minimax"
 jacek: use jacekmax [solved]
 MSmits: well there's enhancements to mcts, did you look at all of those?
 reCurse: Many of them
 MSmits: i'm sure some of them are about this 
 reCurse: Most of my intuitions have been wrong so far
 MSmits: well that's ok, but if you notice the things that dont disgust you perform worse, you really need to let go of the disgust of the best method&#160;:)
 reCurse: Isn't that the whole point of trying stuff
 MSmits: yeah, so you can feel ok about using what you use, even if you never changed it as a result
 MSmits: and maybe you get lucky and do find a better way
 MSmits: problem with going with what experts recommend is that that makes it harder to find improvements
 reCurse: I'm not sure what you're responding to I was just ranting in general
 MSmits: I am co-ranting
 reCurse: Hit a little hard plateau and it's not obvious how to tackle it
 MSmits: are you sure you're not nearing the limit of what you can do with CG limitations (assuming those are still the limitations you use)
 reCurse: Well I'm looking into 1 core CPU only
 reCurse: With 1 sec/move or around that
 jacek: hyperparams tuning?
 MSmits: training time might also be a limitation
 reCurse: So there's a tradeoff that sort of indicates what can actually work
 reCurse: I am speeding up research by exclusively going back to SL for now
 reCurse: It's been translating well to RL so
 MSmits: ah ok
 jacek: you sound like using SL is a disgrace
 reCurse: It's kind of cheating
 reCurse: But it helps finding stuff
 MSmits: I like it for when exact values are known
 MSmits: not for copying expert play
 MSmits: like you're using it to train an endgame solver
 jacek: im using SL to copy 'expert', which was train on RL. is it still SL or RL?
 reCurse: Find someone else to troll
 jacek:&#160;:(
 dbdr: SRL
 jacek: i mean the RL with more rollouts becomes expert for the SL
 MSmits: yeah you did that before
 jacek: and it works
 MSmits: and it's similar to the azero method isnt it
 MSmits: fitting to the results of the previous iteration
 reCurse: azero uses no SL from data it didn't generate
 reCurse: Hence the zero
 MSmits: i know
 reCurse: RL is SL from data you generated
 MSmits: yeah
 reCurse: Let's not troll with semantics
 jacek: it is more self-supervised learning than real rl eh
 MSmits: well personally I did not have this realization before 
 MSmits: did not think about it that way
 reCurse: The problem with NN is it develops general knowledge
 reCurse: When an obscure tactic comes up it's difficult to find it
 reCurse: It correctly evaluates the first few moves to be unlikely which makes it probability of exploration pretty much 0%
 dbdr: I thought that sentence would continue differently

 mhasel: hi folks. I'm trying to change the programming language from C# to C++ but I can't seem to find th option to do so. Can somebody help me out?
 jacek: its above the IDE
 eulerscheZahl: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://prnt.sc/1hv8y29">https://prnt.sc/1hv8y29</a>
 mhasel: ah, thanks
 mhasel: Was looking around in the profile/quest map. never would have figured this out, cheers
 jacek: what experience lead you to use c++ instead of c# ;o
 mhasel: embedded systems :3
 jacek: :scream:
 eulerscheZahl: you prefer C++ too jacek
 jacek: because its faster
 mhasel: also would like to dabble in chess programming
 mhasel: where performance is paramount
 eulerscheZahl: outside of CG what's your language of choice?
 jacek: woah python is 9th in chess
 eulerscheZahl: good news then: we have chess: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess">https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming/chess</a>
 mhasel: nice, thanks
 dbdr: expression "outside of CG" unclear, please explain
 jacek: in work i use java/kotlin android 
 eulerscheZahl: oh, interesting.i should ask people more often to learn something about them
 mhasel: still a student, mostly used C# and C, I kinda feel like C++ is the best of both worlds
 mhasel: so I wanna get into it
 jacek: euler, try random DMs like mk
 eulerscheZahl: we should discuss that on teamviewer
 Maxim251: #mhasel, You should try, but there is a lot of learning
 Pramatarov: In everything have a lot of learning
 Pramatarov:&#160;:)

 IlIlIlIIIllIlI: fastest or reverse when the answer is like x+1 is cancer
 Sulzbach: its sad to see that a factor of deciding the best code its his size
 Sulzbach: a good code its a code ment to be read by humans, even more then to the machine
 FalINTOblivion0112: I agree
 Sulzbach: i wish i could finish my code even when the time has ended though lol
 therealbeef: requiring human readable code is not entirely true for competitive programming; it's all throw-away code we write here. which is part of the fun
 Sulzbach: Oh, I got it now, but I confess im afraid of doing that type of bad practice at work if i play this to much haha

 peterdcarter: um, I finished, 5 puzzles and it says I'm in the top 10% of coders: why do I feel like the difficulty curve might need adjusting?
 5DN1L: peterdcarter If you click your profile to see the details, you will find that the number of puzzles you've solved is not related to your ranking
 5DN1L: You get to top 10% by earning CP not XP
 BlaiseEbuth: The rank is about the compete section, not the puzzles. And it's just a percentage... With about 450K users in leaderboard, the top 10% is for 45K users...

 C_breeze: another clash where the given code does not have correct variable type to accommodate range of tests - hmm seems to be a theme on some of these clashes
 5DN1L: sad
 C_breeze: at least 5 like this in last 24hrs
 5DN1L: You may raise the issue to the puzzle creator if you're able to search it
 C_breeze: I think it's partly due to how most ppl are now using Python and forgetting type limitations in other langs
 5DN1L: oh. you've already finished more than 300 clashes
 5DN1L: you actually have the right to edit clashes now
 C_breeze: yeah, I do sometimes go and approve - hadnt realise I can edit now - might sort out soem of the C given codes if I get time
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:

 Rebollo: Guys, could you please help me with a issue..
 Rebollo: I created a recursive function like this
 Rebollo: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/02f03507-92d2-437a-8254-3f7768e242f4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/02f03507-92d2-437a-8254-3f7768e242f4</a>
 Rebollo: It works fine when I am justi printing the result
 Rebollo: and it is void
 Rebollo: What if I want to return "lastNode" object instead of just printing it??
 Rebollo: I tried everything =(
 BadBurger: im contemplating on quitting on light bulbs... my code runs all the 4..N19 ones, cannot solve N22, and 25 solves but wrong loop counter.... idk that f up.  
 5DN1L: BadBurger Did you read the forum thread? You may find some hints there
 5DN1L: But it's also ok to take a break and come back to it later
 5DN1L: Maybe a refreshed mind will help you come up with new ideas
 CleoattakYT: Hey guys
 BadBurger: if check for lights, that is not correct position, are mutable, and was not touched previous round, i only get 2 available lights 1 time per run in the beginning, but starting from either one dont solve
 BadBurger: and 25 is solved with less loops than required, so N19 should prove the rules are properly coded.. yeah checked forums.. but no help on that
 BadBurger: yeha i need a break from this...
 CleoattakYT: I'm at wood league 2 of pod races but i'm stuck. The program says that the variable "nextCheckpointAngle" isn't define. How can I solve this problem?Âµ
 5DN1L: paste your code hre CleoattakYT
 5DN1L: here*
 CleoattakYT:  if nextCheckpointAngle &gt; 90 or nextCheckpointAngle &lt; -90:
 5DN1L: i mean the whole code

 5DN1L: look at the names used when reading the values
 5DN1L: use the same names below
 CleoattakYT: Gracie mille

 e_fishel: hello
 Rebollo: I have a void function, recursive, works fine
 Rebollo: I just want to return a objet
 Rebollo: A node
 e_fishel: is it c++?
 Uljahn: void can return anything?
 Rebollo: yes
 BlaiseEbuth: Change your function type so...
 Rebollo: c++
 BadBurger: is c++ = d
 BadBurger:&#160;?
 e_fishel: what is that -&gt; syntax
 e_fishel: i didn't know about it
 BlaiseEbuth: pointer access
 BlaiseEbuth: like the a.b but for a pointer
 BlaiseEbuth: a-&gt;b

 Rebollo: everything
 BlaiseEbuth: a void function doesn't return anything by definition...
 Rebollo: I see
 Rebollo: but I tried
 Rebollo: treeNode * findAndPrintFirstCompletedNodes(treeNode *lastNode)
 Rebollo: the goal is to return a treeNode object
 Rebollo: I tried like this:

 Smelty: for the unary code golf solution for character&#160;% has an extra "0 0", or 1, compared to my code. my code right now only works for the first two tests and the alphabet, any explanation?
 5DN1L: extra 0 0?
 Smelty: ye
 Smelty: the solution has an extra 0 0 and the beginning
 Smelty: my output is:0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0answer is:00 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0
 Smelty: edit: meant extra 00 0
 5DN1L: that's a zero
 Smelty: yea
 Smelty: i looked at it wrong
 5DN1L: because each character should be transformed into 7 bits
 Smelty: ah. so should i add a 0 if it isnt enough to 7 bits at the beginning?
 5DN1L: correct
 Smelty: k, thanks
 5DN1L:&#160;:)
 Smelty: *contemplates life choices*
 Smelty: pog it now works thanks

 5DN1L: what do you not understand?

 5DN1L: i see
 5DN1L: [:idx] means [0:idx]
 Idk.-_-: still i cant understand :D
 5DN1L: you know [0]?
 Quidome: the concept is slicing
 Quidome: you take a substring
 Quidome: of multiple chars
 Quidome: I am running 2048 and having this weird problem. No error in the 'normal' test but three errors after submit
 Quidome: Both test sets are the same if you look at the titles...
 Quidome: O, i am lucky a normal one is failing now, good now I can look into it&#160;:)
 5DN1L: :thumbsup:
 Quidome: O now it works again, hm, timeout I suppose then?
 Quidome: Ah, yes timeout with irregular behaviour...
 Quidome:&#160;:(
 jacek: optims have lower tolerance in timeout
 jacek: i.e. 35ms margin may be not enough for 50ms
 jacek: 2048 should always pass even you print invalid actions
 Rebollo: Related to the recursive function that I wanted to return a node, here is the solution: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ff9fe48-e3a1-4fba-b063-9a5bbb537779">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/8ff9fe48-e3a1-4fba-b063-9a5bbb537779</a>

 omboyo: idk- [:ls-x]
 5DN1L: Idk.-_- I  think the question is asking you to replace increasing number of the last characters with stars
 Wontonimo: the [:ls-x] means
 Wontonimo: all items up to the index (ls-x)
 Quidome: got to position 131 on 2048 with simple DFS and really good eval. Limit reached on searching well  I am happy for now :grinning:
 omboyo: means [from zero index: to ls-x], so first time its from [0: to 5], then [0:4]
 Wontonimo: so if i = [1,2,3,4,5]
 Wontonimo: and ls = 1 and x = 2, then
 Wontonimo: i[:ls-x]
 Wontonimo: is the same as saying
 Idk.-_-: oh
 Wontonimo: i[:3]
 Wontonimo: which means [1,2,3]
 Wontonimo: the first 3 items in the list

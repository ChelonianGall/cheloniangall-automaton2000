 codergurl: Coc is down so let's try a private clash
 johnny_the_programmer: Servers still down, made a private clash: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1793056735856b7b12bbf4cfb6b0c9fe51d94ab">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1793056735856b7b12bbf4cfb6b0c9fe51d94ab</a>
 johnny_the_programmer: Private servers not working either
 teddy2021.1096: Seems like the private method doesn't work. 
 johnny_the_programmer:&#160;:(
 teddy2021.1096: Looks like it's Project Euler sadly alone tonight. 
 The_ZimaBlue: Even bot programming seems down
 The_ZimaBlue: testing in arena is not working.
 Golyat: everything multiplayer related seems not to work
 The_ZimaBlue: yah, so the server host must be down
 The_ZimaBlue: hope it gets fixed soon
 Golyat: i still can practice with puzzles. even submitting them works fine
 The_ZimaBlue: yes
 The_ZimaBlue: only multiplayer....
 SubwayMan: yeah multiplayer is a hot mess rn :head_bandage:
 dscientist: :unamused:
 firmac: it's so sad
 dscientist: I am trying since 3pm GMT. i Got back here 5 times to check it.
 struct: well
 struct: they are on france
 struct: its not like this is a paid service
 Monarc: clash of code is broken
 Monarc: bad day
 LuisAFK: it is?
 RR--R: can you try join for private clash to check whether working fine?
 RR--R: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1793117a612391d753a24d001f9600feafeb081">https://www.codingame.com/clashofcode/clash/1793117a612391d753a24d001f9600feafeb081</a>
 Anonymous_Maddy: hii
 LuisAFK: seems to be working
 RR--R: yeah no luck
 LuisAFK: but theres no count down
 Anonymous_Maddy: what happend to clash of code
 LuisAFK: should i start it?
 Anonymous_Maddy: not working
 Anonymous_Maddy: linking many times
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: it's a good day to be a bit more productive than just playing clashes
 Automaton2000: yeah, i can see that
 Anonymous_Maddy: why clash not working
 Uljahn: servers are down, waiting for admins to fix it
 LuisAFK: k
 aCat: automaton is back&#160;? :P
 Anonymous_Maddy: k
 nyn_[Nguyen]: Maybe clashofcode server has broken.
 vgg-zf: yes
 The_ZimaBlue: all multiplayer servers
 The_ZimaBlue: even bot programming
 The_ZimaBlue: testing in arena doesn't work
 Azhy: hello
 Azhy: why i can't test this bo
 Azhy: t
 Azhy: ohh so the bot servers doesnt work also
 Azhy: pleaseee
 Azhy: it's about 7 hours I am doing this week's shit
 Azhy: and this is not working
 struct: chill
 Uljahn: the problem's been reported on discord bug-report channel already, just have patience and wait for [CG]Thibaud to tell us when it's resolved
 [-Shishir]: is clashofcode not working?
 Azhy: nope
 Golyat: everything multiplayer related is not working
 SubwayMan: Just calm down, it's not like we're paying for it. I can go a day without clash&#160;:)
 aCat: solve some puzzles in the meantime&#160;;]
 Chainman: heyyy
 LazyMammal: great time to figure out cg-brutaltester
 sprkrd: and the SDK
 sprkrd: wanna know something funny? Since I have no knowledge whatsoever about Java building tools, and I cannot be bothered with learning maven, ant, and all that, I made my own viz for spring 2021 using SFML: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/qN49knD">https://imgur.com/a/qN49knD</a>
 struct: nice
 sprkrd: Just to check that my environment implementation was working fine, didn't want to debug from hundreds of line of text
 sprkrd: bit time spent there instead of doing my AI, but I feel somewhat proud of that (I don't usually do graphic stuff)
 sprkrd: For next time, probably should learn the SDK
 derjack: noivr
 derjack: noice ~
 Zangwill: Is COC working?
 Crusher54: I think it is broken.
 HeisenDelta: The contest never starts
 nyn_[Nguyen]: it's still broken
 ArtLiteracyStory: I think the server is down
 MaiHuynhTrucAnh: i agree
 ArtLiteracyStory: The server is sleeping
 MaiHuynhTrucAnh: too bad connect
 NguyenVinhHien: why clash of code not working guys
 ArtLiteracyStory: Because we don't pay for it lol
 ArtLiteracyStory: I don't know
 MaiHuynhTrucAnh: :joy: let purchase your first payment
 ArtLiteracyStory: Are there any other alternative games like this?
 Voudrais: Guys why i cant play clash of code
 B4tiste: Theservers are down, the admin is aware of the problem
 21stCenturyPeon: OK, we'll do it the old fashioned way: There's a W*H image of a star field...
 Ultrixx: is it possible that the arena is down? i try to run <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mean-max">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mean-max</a> using the "TEST IN ARENA" button, but nothing happens in arena
 struct: servers are down
 Ultrixx: good to know thanks
 [CG]Thibaud: should be better now Ultrixx
 dbdr: MSmits, improving your connect 4?
 Ultrixx: thanks they seem to work now
 MSmits: just let my meta mcts run overnight and resubmitted
 MSmits: same bot otherwise
 dbdr: aha, so better opening book
 MSmits: it has some rps problems vs robo
 MSmits: and plays the same games most times, so any small change can do the trick. Apparently 8 hrs of running 40 games/second is enough
 struct: 40 games  a second o.o
 MSmits: yeah it was a little scary, running it next to my oware book generator, but went ok :P
 MSmits: book generator slowed down about 30%
 MSmits: (remember, the book thing is using 30 GB)
 MSmits: I guess windows is using swap file in some way for it which is what made it slow down
 dbdr: spammers created 1/2 million pages on my wiki, cleaning it up now&#160;:)
 struct: you still had ram avaiable for meta?
 struct: damn dbdr
 Astrobytes: Is that what's slowed it right down dbdr?
 dbdr: I think so, yes
 MSmits: struct no i didnt, so it spit some book generator stuff to swap file *I assume"*.  Who knows what windows does
 struct: ah it stores on hd
 MSmits: well i didnt tell it to
 MSmits: windows is weird
 struct: well it has no space available
 struct: so it does that
 MSmits: yeah
 Astrobytes: You can change the swap file size
 Astrobytes: If you want to bother with it
 MSmits: ahh ok
 MSmits: well it should not usually be necessary
 struct: i finished solver, I think its working ok
 MSmits: great
 struct: at least for ttt it gives the results I wanted
 derjack: mcts solver?
 struct: yes
 struct: if all childrens are draws + loses the parent should be a draw right?
 derjack: yes
 MSmits: you can take it a bit further even
 Taka-Li: COC resumed?
 Astrobytes: yes
 MSmits: if 1 child is a draw and all siblings of that child have a child that is a draw, then the parent is a draw
 MSmits: it's a form of ab pruning
 derjack: hmm interesting
 MSmits: might not be efficient to implement, but it should help locally when running a meta mcts or similar
 MSmits: well on a nearly solved game that is
 MSmits: otherwise you probably wont reach draws
 derjack: you just ran meta against opponent or general?
 MSmits: what do you mean? Just now overnight for C4?
 MSmits: no i dont counterbook
 MSmits: it's all seflplay
 struct: how does it improve?
 MSmits: it just plays more games and one of the percentages somewhere in the tree beats a previously best move
 MSmits: it only needs 1 change when your opponent always plays the same moves
 MSmits: these NN's are both deterministic *and* good, so they generally play the same moves every time and they also go deep into my meta mcts trees because the good moves get explored deepest
 darkhorse64: my winrate against the new C4 book is better but you are really wrecking all others
 MSmits: well i always was wrecking most except you
 MSmits: still not using compression in book. It's just numbers between 0 and 8 and { and } for closing and opening branches
 darkhorse64: Previously, I had a very hard time, now it's more balanced
 MSmits: it's hard to say with such small statistics though. Your bot always did well vs me
 MSmits: somehwere between 30-60%
 MSmits: maybe I should try the unicode thing and make the book Chinese
 MSmits: it's 40 kB now
 MSmits: Moves Added: 12894
 MSmits: thats a lot
 darkhorse64: total moves&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah, well, you mirror it to get 25k or so
 MSmits: 1 symmetry axis
 MSmits: way more than other games. I never went this far before
 MSmits: because I was hoping to try and solve the game
 derjack: transpositions included?
 MSmits: you mean if the game doesnt follow my tree, yet gets to the same state?
 MSmits: yeah it can go off book and go back on it
 derjack: phew
 MSmits: i always code it that way
 MSmits: there's another kind of transposition for C4 i havent coded
 darkhorse64: you hash the state so that you can enter into the book at given places&#160;?
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: about halfway through the game, you start to have parts of the board that can't connect to 4 anymore
 MSmits: so it doesnt matter what color they are
 MSmits: you could use this for transpositions as well
 MSmits: but complicated
 aCat: Is there a way to call other language from closure?
 MSmits: no idea
 MSmits: not even sure i understand the question
 aCat: you can solve bash puzzles by running python e.g.&#160;;]
 MSmits: i knew that yeah
 aCat: I'm looking for a way to cheat on closure achievement for roller coaster :P
 MSmits: oh, i dont know roller coaster
 darkhorse64: clojure = torture&#160;?
 aCat:&#160;:(
 MSmits: well that last 3 chars are the same, so it's true darkhorse64
 jacek: huh, what kind of comparison is that, javascript?
 MSmits: mmh, it would be funny to code Go in Go
 BANANAINDIANA: helo?
 MSmits: BANANAINDIANA we hear you
 MSmits: but mostly your name
 MSmits: it's really loud
 Uljahn: Automaton2000: there's something stuck in Diana
 Automaton2000: it's nice to have the full rules
 MSmits: he's right
 MSmits: Automaton2000 what do you think about wood leagues
 Automaton2000: it's fun when you can watch the replay
 MSmits: I think anatomic issues are not part of Automaton2000's expertise Uljahn
 Automaton2000: we have a very bad idea
 IvesL: Automaton2000 how are you
 Automaton2000: it was a long time to do more than one
 MSmits: ok stop about the banana now Automaton2000, that's gross
 Automaton2000: what does this even mean
 Hakimm: stull broek
 Hakimm: still broken&#160;?
 Misft: its working already
 jacek: :tada:
 Alemhan: hi guys, i have a problem
 Alemhan: i log in by other device, and there is an error, i cant play coding game
 The_ZimaBlue: how did you log in?
 KalamariKing: The part about "another device"
 KalamariKing: what's the error, does it say? and what IS the other device?
 KalamariKing: Alemhan
 Alemhan: wait
 Alemhan: "You must be owner of the account"
 derjack: oO
 Xzoky174: well did you login??
 Alemhan: but im owner
 Alemhan: and i signed up by another device
 KalamariKing: I've never seen that before
 KalamariKing: What are you signing in with?
 KalamariKing: (Email/password or social)
 Alemhan: just email
 KalamariKing: What about a password
 KalamariKing: Or did you go through the Google auth
 Alemhan: ok, i will delete account
 Alemhan: but i cant
 KalamariKing: why do you have to delete
 KalamariKing: ok, then delete
 TenDRILLL: Are the servers working now?
 KalamariKing: I think they're at least better
 AllYourTrees: does anyone know whether AlphaZero uses a single MCTS instance during self play when gathering training data? or does it use a MCTS instance per player?
 AllYourTrees: a single instance would allow it to build the tree up further, but idk if its like "cheating" almost? since its using searches from the other player
 MSmits: my meta mcts uses a single instance. I am not sure what the consequences are. You don't get that much deeper though, the effect of tree reuse is usually minimal
 MSmits: at most it is as if you used twice the calculation time
 AllYourTrees: wait i'm looking at the pseudocode from the paper and it looks like they start a new instance of MCTS per turn??
 MSmits: but in that case, you could always lower it
 AllYourTrees: hmm good points
 MSmits: you could also start a new instance yes
 MSmits: there is no point reusing the tree when the branching is like 100
 MSmits: except if 1 move out of those 100 is obviously the best
 AllYourTrees: how is your opening book coming along MSmits?
 MSmits: mmh which one. I think you mean the endgame book for oware. In that case, hopefully finishing 31 seeds in about 4 hrs
 MSmits: then it's gonna be multiple days for each next one
 MSmits: stopping at 36 max
 MSmits: if you meant the opening book for C4, then i stopped it again, because my PC became unusable when running both those two :P
 AllYourTrees: hahaha gotcha
 AllYourTrees: how much data is that making :eyes:
 MSmits: 31 seed book is currently making a 3.7 GB restore point every 20 mins and that's also the size it will be in the end (I need about 60-70 iterations)
 MSmits: so i have to remember to delete the restore points or my drive will go full  :)
 MSmits: i like having the option of closing the process and only using max 20 min of calculation
 MSmits: only losing
 AllYourTrees: hah yeah that would fill up fast
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://imgur.com/a/PKNW9kQ">https://imgur.com/a/PKNW9kQ</a>
 MSmits: these are the finished books, you can see the exponential growth in size
 AllYourTrees: yeah very clean growth
 dbdr: nice
 darkhorse64: 200 people in C4&#160;!
 dbdr: I just switched from minimax to mcts in connect 4, definitely stronger. and it's pretty vanilla
 MSmits: wow really
 MSmits: well.. what kind of rollout did you use/
 dbdr: should be fun to add some improvements to it now&#160;:)
 dbdr: pure random
 MSmits: dbdr and I used smarter rollout
 MSmits: avoid losing moves
 MSmits: err darkhorse64
 MSmits: not dbdr :P
 darkhorse64: not yet
 dbdr: I should try not playing center as p1 :D
 AllYourTrees: nice dbdr
 MSmits: please do, thats very much losing&#160;:)
 MSmits: but the moves next to center are worse even
 AllYourTrees: oh dbdr btw do you know what flags they pass to rust compiler?
 dbdr: AllYourTrees release, as far as I know
 MSmits: hey this is cool dbdr, your minimax finds the strongest opening
 derjack: :o
 dbdr: I don't know the exact ones, I think they don't use cargo
 MSmits: the one next to center
 MSmits: but minimax is not made for steal option, so hardcode that&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: okay gotcha
 dbdr: MSmits in arena I have mcts. and yes it does find the stronger, when you ignore steal :D
 MSmits: ohh ok
 dbdr: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76a6e783-53d7-4af8-b9ae-18d84eac04b0">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/76a6e783-53d7-4af8-b9ae-18d84eac04b0</a>
 MSmits: yeah it's really quite obvious and when you play millions of games locally, it never stops being the best
 dbdr: the logical dealing of steal would be score -&gt; -abs(score)&#160;:)
 dbdr: should work on any game
 derjack: that way bad move becomes good move
 derjack: for steal use as closest to 50%
 dbdr: I have scores in -1..1
 MSmits: so 0
 MSmits: closest to 0
 derjack: your way would avoid very good moves (thats alright) but would favor very bad moves as well, so 2nd player would not steal
 dbdr: very bad moves is close to -1, -abs(-1) is -1
 derjack: oh, the abs
 dbdr: it will choose move closest to 0
 MSmits: ahh right
 derjack: :nerd:
 MSmits: in any case it should be picking 2nd move from left or right (index 1 or 7)
 dbdr: right, but that's hardcoding&#160;:)
 MSmits: i meant, that should be the result from not hardcoding, or you're handicapped&#160;:)
 <b>**dbdr speaking against hardcoding, which shows anything can happen :D</b>
 dbdr: agreed
 derjack: so as 2nd player how would you choose if the move is worth steal?
 dbdr: what kind of stats do you get MSmits? or is that confidential?
 derjack: just additional action - steal?
 MSmits: not confidential, i am on different system but it's around 30%-50%-70%-80%-70% currently, but WR's become more extreme as parts of the tree get solved
 MSmits: for index 0 to 4 i mean
 MSmits: ignoring symmetry moves
 AllYourTrees: wouldn't it be something like if -steal is better than win pct of other possible moves?
 MSmits: thats what abs does AllYourTrees
 dbdr: I mean rollout count MSmits
 MSmits: ohh
 MSmits: sec
 MSmits: need to turn off book for this
 MSmits: 2nd turn 29k but i do a rollout from each child, so have to do this times 9
 MSmits: so 200k i guess?
 MSmits: gonna submit without book, see if i still get to 1. darkhorse64 is tough cookie and with robo in there...
 MSmits: but games are more random without book so maybe robo is less of an issue then, no idea
 darkhorse64: 29k x 9; it's huge, I get only 160K smart rollouts, 350k full random
 MSmits: this is likely the difference between our bots then as we both dont do anything else
 MSmits: btw i do use simd for calculating winning moves
 MSmits: so that might be it
 darkhorse64: I thought my code was efficient, it's sluggish
 MSmits: my code is not complicated compared to some other bots. Without book under 600 lines
 darkhorse64: I do that too but it's not faster than scalar which I really can't figure out
 MSmits: well i am not 100% sure mine is faster than scalar. I didnt have scala
 MSmits: scalar
 MSmits: I literally wrote this bot in half a day. I normally dont get things right in one go :P
 MSmits: takes weeks
 MSmits: I would really like to share with you how i do the thing, but I dont know how to do it without giving away my whole book
 MSmits: other bots have eval and such and thats where the advantage is
 darkhorse64: My expand is a bit complicated to account for smart rollouts and solver. I don't start a rollout if there is a winning/losing move
 MSmits: my whole bot i mean
 MSmits: this bot has no eval, so all it is, is performance and a smart rollout
 MSmits: hmm ok
 MSmits: i just dont consider moves that are losing
 MSmits: they dont become children
 MSmits: if this means 0 children get created, then parent is a win
 MSmits: only is annoying when making your final move choice and the root is a leaf :P
 darkhorse64: I always create children if they are losing not to leave holes in my tree and avoid null ptr
 darkhorse64: it's dumb but safe
 MSmits: yeah i guess it doesnt matter that much
 MSmits: i like saving my node pool a bit more, but its probably negligible
 MSmits: my expansion is 70 lines so also pretty long
 darkhorse64: Against good bots, shit does not happen but it avoids timeouts against weak ones
 MSmits: you mean avoiding them selecting losing moves and you not having it in the tree?
 MSmits: I just do checks for that and reset the tree
 MSmits: in the update function right after reading input
 MSmits: but I agree, I spend too much time fixing bugs as a result of this practice
 darkhorse64: I have left #if 0 code for random rollouts as a baseline performance so it's longer. Yep, in a winning position, resetting the tree is harmless
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: not gonna reach nr 1 this time
 MSmits: your bot is still the same right?
 darkhorse64: Yes. C4 lore matters
 MSmits: i think i just boosted robo 
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/msmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/msmits</a>
 MSmits: look at this lol
 MSmits: what is with Robo's bot
 MSmits: i am not even using book this time
 MSmits: so this is random
 MSmits: this brings back memories from his yavalath NN :P
 MSmits: sometimes it was wrecking me and sometimes i got 100%
 MSmits: usually playing a bunch of identical games
 darkhorse64: One or more training days for robo and he may wrecked us
 darkhorse64: wreck
 MSmits: not with book i dont think. He's gonna find the same lines of play
 MSmits: i already found those and solved them
 MSmits: so perpetual draw I'm afraid
 darkhorse64: Right, I'll be wrecked
 MSmits: but he;ll be 1 because of other players submitting
 MSmits: it will depend on how much his NN is generalized
 MSmits: apparently they are great at memorization, which makes it a lot like an opening book :P
 darkhorse64: If there were bmi for simd, i would consider parallel rollouts
 MSmits: bmi for simd?
 MSmits: how do you mean
 darkhorse64: popcount, pdep, pext
 struct: which operation?
 struct: ah
 MSmits: ahh I see
 MSmits: I think avx 512 has those?
 MSmits: or some of those
 darkhorse64: some
 darkhorse64: but not pdep/pext
 darkhorse64: I think
 MSmits: rollout count only takes you so far though
 MSmits: the first few moves are critical
 MSmits: nn will train how to do those correctly
 MSmits: extra rollout means you have perfect play from ply 28 instead of ply 30
 darkhorse64: They all can be emulated but will the performance suffer&#160;? You need a huge boost for rollouts count to gain measurable strength
 MSmits: exactly
 MSmits: not saying  mcts will not play really well early game, but a simple game like this only allows one or two mistakes
 MSmits: like oware
 darkhorse64: However, I disagree with the idea that rollouts matters in the ending. For me, MCTS is like a sampler, the more samples, the more accurate at the beginning
 MSmits: well it matters at some distance from the ending
 MSmits: the more rollouts, the further away from the ending your bot will play perfectly
 darkhorse64: except when the game is full of traps like Y where you cannot escape all of them
 MSmits: then the ending is poorly defined
 MSmits: in C4 good players will nearly always fill the board
 darkhorse64: But I agree of your comment for ending playing strength
 MSmits: in Yavalath that only happens when all traps get avoided
 darkhorse64: Which occurs rarely for me
 darkhorse64: :grinning:
 derjack: :upside_down:
 MSmits: yeah its really hard to do for a mcts bot
 MSmits: but they are awesome at the late game
 MSmits: because their sampling avoids the situation where you cant play hexes at the end 
 MSmits: because random playouts randomly go to end, so you avoid situations like that
 MSmits: hard to quantify this with an eval
 darkhorse64: There is one thing that I have not done for Y: biasing the rollout or selection towards moves 4 hexes from my current pieces or use EPT at least at the start for the same purpose
 MSmits: i did try to filter for those
 MSmits: not allowing moves 4 away from everything else
 MSmits: did not do anything
 darkhorse64: I mean: sampling far away moves is just a waste of cycles. 4 hexes away maybe is too crude
 MSmits: EPT at start might help but it might also let you set up situations where in the endgames theres many places where you cant move
 MSmits: far away moves do not help you avoid traps at all
 MSmits: and since most games end with a trap, i agree
 Xzoky174: why are there so many bots
 darkhorse64: because it's the "raison d'être" for CG
 reCurse: Think he meant clash bots
 MSmits: ahh makes sense
 MSmits: Xzoky174 because there aren't enough players to fill the roster
 reCurse: Past tense because he's gone :P
 MSmits: ah well, someone else may read :P
 MSmits: what are you up to reCurse?
 ja_fica: NN is impressive but how is Lks10 in 22th in UTTT using C#, O3 from c++ is much faster...
 darkhorse64: my answer applies to CoCs :stuck_out_tongue:
 MSmits: ja_fica just using the fastest language doesn't mean your bot has the most rollouts. This is aside from the fact that rollouts arent everything 
 reCurse: Putting a bit of time in my chess sim, busy otherwise
 reCurse: You?
 MSmits: you can use a language inefficientgly
 MSmits: still making endgame book for oware to use in supervised learning and adapting meta mcts for same purpose
 MSmits: 31 seeds almost finished
 ja_fica: Ofc there is no doubt that the algorithm is the most important
 ja_fica: BUT, the same algorithm in c++ with O3 is probably faster
 MSmits: thats very true
 MSmits: 2 times faster compared to C# probably
 KalamariKing: oh hey MSmits!
 MSmits: maybe more
 reCurse: C# can actually be competitive, especially with the latest versions of .net core
 ja_fica: In my computer it was actualy 41x faster
 ZarthaxX: maybe you coded it bad ja_fica
 MSmits: it was always competitive in most games, but uttt? That would be news to me. How much did it change?
 KalamariKing: are there actually coc bots?
 ja_fica: 20x faster when I have been careful with garbage collector
 reCurse: No it wasn't always
 reCurse: Was still in debug mode until recently
 MSmits: ja_fica you need to use object pools
 reCurse: Was still Mono until recently
 reCurse: That was hard to compete
 MSmits: ah I see
 MSmits: it used to be similar in speed to java
 MSmits: but much faster now i guess
 reCurse: Don't know enough about java if it's affected by debug mode
 reCurse: But much harder to be nearly as low level
 reCurse: Even with older c#
 MSmits: btw, i meant it was always competitive, because in most games a 2 or 3x faster algorithm isnt enough to make you win
 reCurse: :thinking:
 MSmits: uttt is different like that
 reCurse: Most games?
 ja_fica: I agree
 MSmits: smart approaches are more important
 MSmits: is what i am sayingh
 MSmits: most contests do not have c++ at the top because it is fastest
 ja_fica: Yes, going from MTCS to a MTCS-solver makes a huge difference even with half of the rollouts
 MSmits: it is because top players like to pick the fastest language
 MSmits: no reason you can tbe nr 1 with C#
 reCurse: I meant competitive as in reaching top ~~ legend
 ja_fica: Yes, but the real discussion is why not use the same algorithm into a faster environment
 MSmits: yeah. In uttt its not
 reCurse: Maybe top 100, I don't know the exact number
 reCurse: Past a certain point though, good luck
 MSmits: but in many of those ex contest multis, top 10 is very possible with something other than c, c++ or rust
 AllYourTrees: what is an MCTS solver?
 MSmits: it's mostly the simple boardgames where you get stuck with somewhat slower languages
 MSmits: because everyone does the same thing and then performance matters more
 reCurse: Everyone does the same thing except there's a 5-10 points spread in the top 20...
 struct: bit runner might be the exception
 ja_fica: MTCS -solver is an upgrade from regular MTCS where you start tagging nodes as WIN, LOSS and DRAW heavly prunning the tree
 MSmits: reCurse	 well there is now that there are NN's&#160;:)
 MSmits: thats a whole different subject
 reCurse: Forget NNs
 MSmits: ok check out langtons ant
 ja_fica: You use NN?
 ja_fica: in UTTT?
 MSmits: noone figured out what nr 1 did
 MSmits: and he's nr 1 with slow language
 MSmits: ja_fica yes reCurse and jacek do NN in uttt
 reCurse: I'd say it's more the exception
 reCurse: Than "most multis"
 MSmits: I think in most cases where +5 happens it's because of coder creativity and not the choice of language
 reCurse: I say it's b oth
 MSmits: it is both, to some degree
 MSmits: the degree is much more heavily skewed toward performance in uttt
 MSmits: and less so in other games
 MSmits: connect4 is also one of those games
 MSmits: but when eval becomes important, performance becomes less important
 ja_fica: I have created a bot using DRL for uttt but I cant transfer the weigths as I have used keras with multiple shared layers (made a huge difference), and it too difficult to make them useful in 100ms 
 MSmits: ah
 MSmits: use Mokka
 MSmits: assuming no convolution layers
 MSmits: if you have convolution, then good luck :P
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://github.com/marchete/Mokka">https://github.com/marchete/Mokka</a>
 MSmits: havent tried it myself, but he provides jupyter notebooks with tests that show keras gives same output as his c++ framework
 MSmits: for using weights in CG, you need to compress them
 MSmits: &lt; 50k should not be hard
 ja_fica: I dont found it useful to use convolution in this, although I have written then from scrath for fun&#160;:). The bes result was to used a  shared NN for top left bot and right, other for the 4 diagonals and 1 for the center, and linking neural network for all
 AllYourTrees: dbdr have you used avx in rust yet?
 MSmits: ja_fica interesting. It would be cool to see it in action on CG
 KalamariKing: oh my god
 MSmits: what is it KalamariKing?
 KalamariKing: ja_fica *didn't *scratch *best *use
 MSmits: It's cool to write from scratch
 MSmits: just have to verify that it's actually doing what it's supposed to
 KalamariKing: MSmits were you there yesterday when I announced my challenge?
 MSmits: what is your challenge?
 MSmits: i wasnt here
 ja_fica: Convolution are just small neuralnetworks for each set of neighbour pixeis using the same weigths, the difficult part is joining the cahnnel and avegare the error 
 MSmits: you mean small layers?
 AllYourTrees: the hardest part for me was stride &amp; padding
 ja_fica: I have used regular padding
 dbdr: AllYourTrees yes, avx in rust
 MSmits: dbdr did you use avx in both c++ and rust and is there any difference?
 AllYourTrees: dbdr nice!!!! do you know of a tutorial for using avx in rust?
 MSmits: or just naming of functions?
 dbdr: I don't do c++&#160;;)
 MSmits: oh, i thought you did before, so you were always rusty?
 ja_fica: How do you send red messages to anyone?
 KalamariKing: ok my challenge was to make a simple program in css
 KalamariKing: pure css
 MSmits: it contains your name ja_fica, when it's red
 dbdr: AllYourTrees basics in <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/simd-for-faster-computing.html">https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/simd-for-faster-computing.html</a>
 dbdr: MSmits on CG I went Java -&gt; Rust
 MSmits: KalamariKing ahh ok, that's not my thing. I barely have experience with css. I have to prepare my classes well, when teaching html/css
 dbdr: I did some C ages ago
 MSmits: oh right, you had that java uttt bot
 dbdr: still do&#160;:)
 MSmits: yea
 ja_fica: MSmits, you can use convoluiton layeres or a groups of conv layers, I was not smart enought the join layers
 dbdr: one day I'll convert it to rust&#160;:)
 ja_fica: *backpropagate the error twice
 MSmits: and this is minimax right?
 dbdr: minimax, yes
 ja_fica: Rust is faster then c++?
 dbdr: no
 dbdr: roughly the same
 ja_fica: Is there a big advantage using rust?
 dbdr: more advanced type system
 KalamariKing: is that it?
 MSmits: I wonder how well it'll do. It will get at most 1 extra iteration, but most turns it won't
 MSmits: thats the problem with iterative deepening
 KalamariKing: I thought rust kinda sucked fsr
 dbdr: basically you can't get segfault unless you use unsafe blocks (which can be useful for some performance tricks)
 dbdr: MSmits even half an iteration can be useful
 MSmits: how does that work dbdr, i never used half iterations?
 MSmits: is this because you finished best move from last iteration
 MSmits: and the new iteration has a new move that is better?
 dbdr: I start the nest iteration with the best move of the previous one. so if another move beats it, I can use it, even if I did not explore the whole width
 dbdr: *next
 MSmits: ah i see yeah thats what i meant. Smart
 MSmits: now all my minimax will be better 
 AllYourTrees: i love the rust type system
 MSmits: thanks&#160;:)
 dbdr: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: its such a guilty pleasure for me, spending all day coding in python at work
 dbdr: but you're in MCTS everywhere, aren't you?
 ja_fica: The current processors lack a shared memory for an attached GPU
 MSmits: yeah, but I occasionally try minimax and then it's always worse. Maybe because I dont include things like this
 AllYourTrees: ty for the link dbdr
 dbdr: minimax might be better for shallow traps, no?
 MSmits: sure
 MSmits: not many games have them though
 AllYourTrees: also for anyone who is interested in Rust, the documentation is very great, built in package manager, great IDE support in VS code, works on every OS
 MSmits: and when they do... and its early game, i have other ways :P
 dbdr: only for bookable games...
 AllYourTrees: and i'd argue helps build good coding practices, but i guess thats debatable
 MSmits: dbdr true, wont work on onitama, clobber, bandas etc.
 MSmits: btw, jacek training a nn on onitama is pretty cool
 MSmits: with that card stuff. Pretty creative
 MSmits: I can see how it would be doable for me in most boardgames, the way jacek does, but that one...
 derjack: :blush:
 MSmits: if you see how much trouble you guys have beating karliso in uttt and compare that to how much karliso got wrecked in onitama
 MSmits: he's nr 1 almost everywhere he makes a good effort
 MSmits: I dunno, I just love onitama. Too bad I ran out of ideas. Would have liked to have played it a bit more
 reCurse: I'm using chess partly not to relapse in uttt
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: step in a rabbit hole to avoid dropping into a sink hole?
 reCurse: Sick of putting so much time in a game I hate
 AllYourTrees: sounds like we need an ultimate chess game
 MSmits: yeah I can see that. I actually like uttt generally, with all its flaws, but if you hate it and still feel you have to maintain nr 1 position... yeah that could get annoying&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Nobody forces you...
 MSmits: he forces him :P
 reCurse: Yeah no kidding... competitiveness is a thing.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oh, sote working again?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er site
 Astrobytes: yes the sote is wirking
 MSmits: yup, my theory is that you can enjoy CG more if you're not usually nr 1 when you try
 HalfLegend: Hey, I need to debug my Connect 4. So my algo works when I'm player 1 but doesn't play when I'm player 2. How can I set the conditions to be player 2 instead of the boss so I can debug?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: twork it if your werth it
 MSmits: you can let go of games when you run out of ideas, try new stuff
 reCurse: You can love the hard competition and hate the game
 reCurse: It works
 MSmits: sure
 reCurse: Until it goes out of balance
 PatrickMcGinnisII: tryAngle Catch is kinda deep, very long games
 MSmits: thing is, when you're not the best, you can view it more as improvement vs yourself. The leaderboard just becomes a ladder you use to see how much better you've gotten and the actual opponents become less important. But when it's top 5, it's different
 darkhorse64: HalfLegend: select boss as player #1 in the IDE
 BlaiseEbuth: So it's all good. No need to complain...
 reCurse:&#160;?
 reCurse: Your point?
 MSmits: my point is, you have more fun when you're not as strong&#160;:)
 reCurse: BlaiseEbuth: 
 HalfLegend: Thank you&#160;:)
 BlaiseEbuth: Hmm&#160;?
 MSmits: noone is complaining
 MSmits: we're just discussing the psychology of competitiveness
 BlaiseEbuth: Meh.
 MSmits: I see euler enjoy codeforces a lot, even if he's not top player. I doubt tourist has as much fun if he's not nr 1 that one time 
 MSmits: it's a lot of pressure
 MSmits: granted, all the ps5's and laptops help
 darkhorse64: I feel daporan pressure to submit 3 mn before the end of private contest
 BlaiseEbuth: It is. If you let it put pressure on you...
 darkhorse64: 30
 MSmits: hah yeah
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth it's not that simple though&#160;:)
 MSmits: maybe you're wiser and have more self control than the rest of us&#160;:)
 reCurse: Uh? I don't see that as a self-control issue at all
 MSmits: well control as in, not letting things bother you
 MSmits: might be wrong choice of words
 darkhorse64: He is counting CG tortured souls
 BlaiseEbuth: You can be invested, enjoy the fact to be first, but still not fail into depression when you drop second...
 MSmits: I generally succeed in not letting stuff bother me, but i did turn my meta mcts back on when robo started wrecking me in c4. so, maybe not entirely succesful 
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth you can, but that doesn't mean it's easy to do
 Astrobytes: Everyone's mindset is different. Everyone's brain is different. Everyone's personality is different.
 darkhorse64: do not forget your "grimoire" if you do want that I wreck you
 darkhorse64: do not
 Astrobytes: Hence things affect different people differently.
 MSmits: bah, not wrecking, 50&#160;% :P
 darkhorse64: yes but #1
 MSmits: that's it, i am calling it my grimoire now
 reCurse: You need to care a lot to compete, so why wouldn't you be happy if things you care about don't go your way? You're misunderstanding the nature of the thing.
 reCurse: *unhappy
 MSmits: darkhorse64 people pushing me up, I'll wait. As long as robo doesnt submit i am ok :P
 BlaiseEbuth: I would rather say that you're generalizing your view of the things. But meh...
 BlaiseEbuth: -s
 MSmits: well his position is rare
 MSmits: by definition
 darkhorse64: His training session has not ended
 reCurse: Still not sure what your point is, except I should shut up or something
 MSmits: darkhorse64 true
 PatrickMcGinnisII: we're all addicted.  Keyboards should be shaped like (.) (.) ies
 BlaiseEbuth: "You can compete in good mood even if things don't go your way"
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Elon Musk is scared of CG, too much AI.&#160;;)
 reCurse: Ok?
 MSmits: BlaiseEbuth some people can, but the more competitive they are, the harder this is
 KalamariKing: What's the conversation about rn its too chaotic to keep up with
 KalamariKing: competitions?
 reCurse: Not sure either
 MSmits: it derailed a bit
 MSmits: started as the dilemma between disliking a game but doing well and wanting to keep your rank
 PatrickMcGinnisII: KalamariKing Online cocaine, I mean comps ... there ARE paid $ comps, now those would be stressful
 reCurse: No it started as me not wanting to put time on uttt anymore
 MSmits: right
 reCurse: Not sure how it got to whatever it is now
 MSmits: probably my fault
 MSmits: I'll stop steering&#160;:)
 MSmits: next subject
 darkhorse64: or putting too much pressure on yourself for the ranking and losing the fun meanwhile
 MSmits: that was my point originally
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Stay away from UTTT or start re-cursing
 reCurse: It's not about pressure at all
 reCurse: I hate communicating so badly
 derjack: you pursue the ladder, but then when youre #1 the motivation subsides somewhat
 reCurse: There is a love of very hard difficulty found by competing with other people putting a lot of time in doing the same
 reCurse: Which can be worth doing even if you hate other aspects of it
 MSmits: sure
 reCurse: That's all. When it goes out of balance, it stops
 reCurse: If you take that as complaining or whatever, not sure what else to say
 MSmits: I don't think it's complaining

 MSmits: 31 seeds almost done
 MSmits: it's ridiculous to spend so much time just because a few states are still changing their score, but that's the nature of loopy games =/
 PatrickMcGinnisII: what r u iterating?
 MSmits: i am giving an extra turn to all oware states and seeing what the net capture gain is
 MSmits: at some point giving more turns doesnt change anything
 MSmits: then i might consider i extended the game to infinity and i solved the boardstate
 BlaiseEbuth: I didn't understand it like that... My apologies reCurse, I read and react a bit fast.
 reCurse: All good
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits run your arbitrary sims on the Mega Millions plz
 MSmits: huh what? I am all for mega million sims, but not sure what you mean
 PatrickMcGinnisII: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.flalottery.com/">https://www.flalottery.com/</a>
 PatrickMcGinnisII:&#160;;)
 MSmits: mmh doubt that helps :P
 MSmits: most I achieve with this is some practice, a better rank and heating my house :P
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I ran programs for years, i calculated they increased my chances of winning by almost 3%.  Maybe with reCurse NN ... heh&#160;;)
 MSmits: wow nice
 HalfLegend: First player (BOSS 1) chose columnIndex 1Sortie d'erreur&#160;:Previous player action: -2
 MSmits: I love obsession like that
 HalfLegend: (Connect 4) Why is the previous player action -2 and not the column index that the first player played in which is 1?
 HalfLegend: This is the very first turn
 jacek: STEAL move?
 HalfLegend: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/561911196">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/561911196</a>
 jacek: oh hmm
 PatrickMcGinnisII: About every 3 months there's this critical probability when I break even on the lottery overall, but no big winners.&#160;:(
 HalfLegend: I'm printing oppPreviousAction right
 PatrickMcGinnisII: complete waste of time...yes obsession
 jacek: hmm it works for me normally eh
 HalfLegend: I prolly did something wrong haha
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I hate when i write 300 lines of code and can't get out of wood4
 RoboStac: are you sure you've not missed an input line - -2 would be the last valid action given to you?
 HalfLegend: This is the part where the game gets the previous action right&#160;?
 HalfLegend: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab9cef86-fc24-41a1-b9ce-6933380f35b4">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/ab9cef86-fc24-41a1-b9ce-6933380f35b4</a>
 HalfLegend: Which is -1 if there hasn't been an action yet, -2 for a steal and otherwise the index of the column?
 RoboStac: yeah
 HalfLegend: So for some reason I'm getting a steal instead of an index :no_mouth:
 RoboStac: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cddf5aee-c036-4909-8228-c0b8d046a554">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/cddf5aee-c036-4909-8228-c0b8d046a554</a>
 RoboStac: is what the input would be 
 RoboStac: so the -2 is the line directly before the action
 RoboStac: it sounds like you've deleted an input line or something
 pop223: can people help me  win this
 HalfLegend: I honestly might have haha
 HalfLegend: I'mma look into it, thanks 
 pop223: can someone give me there hole code
 BlaiseEbuth: Of course. How much do you pay&#160;?
 HalfLegend: hahaha
 zgooner: hello, can someone help me understand how game of life works?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: MSmits physics guy...if you spun a combination of mercury and gallium at room temp w/ a magnetic field... could the contraption lose weight if an upper shell was capable of quantum locking?
 1rre: Yeah so you've gotta go pick up samples, get the molecules it says &amp; submit them at the lab
 HalfLegend: It's weird cause my previous action is correct when I'm player 1 but wrong when I'm player 2
 1rre: I'll see if I can find my setup code that literally goes &amp; does 1 sample at once
 1rre: Wait no that was code 4 life sorrt
 1rre: *sorry
 MSmits: no idea PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: not familiar wth quantum locking
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok, tx.  win the lotto for me and I'll build it
 Westicles: zgooner, there is a new puzzle that explains it
 Westicles: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/custom-game-of-life">https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/custom-game-of-life</a>
 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisII your question might not be valid. I think you mean the mass instead of the weight
 zgooner: thanks
 MSmits: weight and mass are very different things
 MSmits: one of the most confusing things in my physics classes is the difference between weight, mass and gravity. Most people dont know
 AllYourTrees: awwww yisss NN working in C4 in codingame!!!!
 MSmits: you mean yours? If so, then GJ!
 AllYourTrees: yeah!
 AllYourTrees: ty!
 jacek: CNN?
 MSmits: that would be even more impressive
 AllYourTrees: nah MLP, the conv version was too big
 AllYourTrees: i have a pure rust conv though, have to figure out the right parameters i think
 jacek: MLP sucks for connection games unless you have right inputs
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not mass.  Want to quantum lock using the earth as a magnet and use the liquid 'engine' to apply a small Newton force upwards.  I dunno, I'm crazy. ignore me.
 MSmits: yeah when the input is the ntuple, the information about connections is encoded in that
 AllYourTrees: i'm just using one hot of the board so far
 MSmits: ah ok, I'll try to ignore, but it's hard when you are using physics words :P
 MSmits: when are we seeing it on the leaderboard AllYourTrees
 MSmits: it doesnt have to be top 10 for it to be an achievement
 AllYourTrees: its battling in wood 2 now
 MSmits: ah ok
 MSmits: curious to see how well it does
 AllYourTrees: me too :eyes:
 AllYourTrees: it probably needs to be trained more
 MSmits: or experimented with more
 MSmits: so many things you can try
 AllYourTrees: and this was one that was trained using 1 MCTS for the whole game in self play, instead of a new MCTS each turn
 AllYourTrees: yeah soooo many hyperparams...
 MSmits: yeah i doubt this is a fundamental choice, either way will probably work
 Westicles: Didn't someone on here have a brother-in-law who works for DARPA and says they have anti-gravity working already?
 jacek: its a0? eith policy and value?
 AllYourTrees: jacek yeah
 MSmits: oh, like robo then
 AllYourTrees: okay in wood 1 now
 AllYourTrees: immediate loss to darkhorse64 lol
 jacek: how many units/layers
 MSmits: well it doesnt get much better than darkhorse64&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: this one is 32 units, 2 shared layers, then splits into policy value. both p &amp; v have 2 layers also with 32 units
 AllYourTrees: ReLU activations
 MSmits: did you hardcode opening move?
 AllYourTrees: nope
 MSmits: to get a fair comparison with others, you need to hardcode it to move 1 or 7
 MSmits: 2nd from left or right
 MSmits: and steal the correct moves
 MSmits: meaning everything except the corner ones
 AllYourTrees: kk
 MSmits: oh and you dont have to steal 1 or 7, they are 50% wr moves
 MSmits: but you can steal it... shouldnt matter
 AllYourTrees: :scream:
 AllYourTrees: how big are other ppls NNs?
 MSmits: often they fill the codesize
 MSmits: or near enough
 MSmits: so like 50k weights? Something of that order
 MSmits: RoboStac can tell you 
 AllYourTrees: is there a way to tell how close you are to filling the size?
 RoboStac: yeah, paste it into code golf
 RoboStac: it shows the character count at the bottom
 AllYourTrees: oh man i'm only using 41k chars
 MSmits: a crude estimation is your file size, which should be some distance form 200 kb
 MSmits: maybe 190 kb or something
 MSmits: AllYourTrees if this includes a lot of code then thats small yes
 RoboStac: currently mines is 3 conv layers (3x3x16) into a 128 hidden layer into policy / value . But I think I've probably gone too big.
 AllYourTrees: actually the code is half of that size currently it looks like
 AllYourTrees: i have some comments an unused stuff i can remove
 AllYourTrees: RoboStac interesting, ty for details
 MSmits: Robo how come your bots always pick on me :P
 MSmits: my cg stats result is crazy and i didnt book on this submit
 MSmits: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/MSmits">http://cgstats.magusgeek.com/app/multi-connect-4/MSmits</a>
 AllYourTrees: does anyone minify code when submitting? mines all indented with spaces which probably takes up a good chunk
 MSmits: look at the 17% RoboStac
 MSmits: I'm sure it's total coincidence, but still funny, it happens a lot
 MSmits: AllYourTrees it is what i would do
 AllYourTrees: ended up 16th! pretty exciting :D
 MSmits: yeah not bad for first try
 AllYourTrees: honestly probably better than i would want... now when i have a hard time surpassing its gonna get frustrating hah
 AllYourTrees: like what happened in the last contest when i couldn't get better than my day 3 code for the whole contest :scream:
 MSmits: best thing is to just focus on improvement. You don't control how good the other bots are
 MSmits: and some of us have been doing this for years&#160;:)
 AllYourTrees: good point :blush:
 struct: js driving me crazy
 MSmits: not to say some new player can come in, wreck all of us and then start asking us the most basic questions
 struct: im trying to draw mcts tree
 MSmits: (karliso)
 KalamariKing: so what you're saying is, I should dive right in and make a crazy bot without knowing how it works and then once it does, I ask you why MSmits
 HalfLegend: I fixed my algo finally haha
 AllYourTrees: alright now i need to start working... see ya'll later!
 jacek: HalfLegend what was it
 HalfLegend: I had an issue due to the extra action on turn 1,  and my initial attempt to fix this cause the other issue giving the wrong previous action
 HalfLegend: So now I'm just ignoring the steal for now haha
 MSmits: KalamariKing worked for karliso :P
 MSmits: well he asked some questions during
 MSmits: but only simple mcts stuff and minimax stuff
 MSmits: he took several nr 1's on board games in a few weeks
 MSmits: he's not active now though, but try beating what he has on the leaderboard, mostly NN's succeed. In some games I match him at most, but dont actually beat him
 MSmits: just generally a very talented player
 dbdr: nice AllYourTrees!
 MSmits: yup, 3 rust in top 20. He's coming for you dbdr&#160;:)
 dbdr:&#160;:+1:
 MSmits: btw KalamariKing  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://cgmulti.azke.fr/players?p=karliso">https://cgmulti.azke.fr/players?p=karliso</a>
 MSmits: it's a weird list
 HalfLegend: I went from rank 59 to 7 let's gooo
 Dark_coder9: Have you guys seen the code

 KalamariKing: why did you paste code.org source
 KalamariKing: MSmits there's so many games :cold_sweat:
 MSmits: yeah, did maybe half of them
 MSmits: but thats over 3 yrs
 KalamariKing: which do you think I should start with?
 MSmits: start with what is fun, i dont know what you like
 MSmits: I like simple boardgames, but thats me
 BlaiseEbuth: All
 KalamariKing: well gimme a spread of less-complex games
 KalamariKing: I don't think the nintendo challenge would be suitable
 MSmits: I feel obligated to mention paper soccer, since jacek isnt
 MSmits: KalamariKing do you want to try NN's or just a simple search algo?
 BlaiseEbuth: Or if/else forest&#160;?
 MSmits: or the forest sure
 MSmits: i like code a la mode for if else
 MSmits: well i did during contest, i would never go back :P
 MSmits: there's physics games too
 BlaiseEbuth: pcr :scream:
 MSmits: coders strike back (csb) and pcr yes
 MSmits: pcr has complex sim
 MSmits: but I liked it
 MSmits: mean max and fantastic bits also physics
 BlaiseEbuth: CR is a sort of hybrid...
 MSmits: hmm code royale?
 BlaiseEbuth: Yes
 MSmits: it's not a bad game, but poorly balanced
 MSmits: people will only use the knights generally
 MSmits: archers and giants are not much used
 MSmits: was my first contest game
 BlaiseEbuth: Don't remember well, just that I didn't performed... ^^'
 MSmits: robo won it with a beamsearch
 RoboStac: giants were definitely needed 
 MSmits: yeah at the top
 MSmits: i made 5th without giants
 MSmits: during contest that is, no idea where it is at now
 BlaiseEbuth: Site say that my first contest was TGE...
 BlaiseEbuth: But I probably don't did big things...
 darkhorse64: Crystal rush is a nice game. Ocean of Code too but be prepared to write loads of code
 darkhorse64: MSmits climbing on C4
 BlaiseEbuth: The first one that I remember being a little bit involved in was Mean Max
 darkhorse64: claiming #1 while doing nothing, that's stylish
 Westicles: He's just a kid.  Try 2048 first
 BlaiseEbuth: There's no kids on internet.
 Westicles: There are kids, just no girls
 BlaiseEbuth: Not sure... :thinking:
 reCurse: Yay fixed last bug in chess sim
 dbdr: "last bug" famous last words?&#160;;)
 reCurse: Well I ran perft on a bunch of positions
 darkhorse64: I have fixed too many last bugs
 reCurse: As good as perfect
 reCurse: Almost 67 millions moves / sec
 darkhorse64: OO
 BlaiseEbuth: Another jacek alt...
 KalamariKing: MSmits NN ofc
 KalamariKing: nns are just more fun
 KalamariKing: reCurse is that on cg or on your personal computer?
 reCurse: Personal computer, single core
 KalamariKing: Oh wow
 KalamariKing: Think I might go with uttt for my first nn and my first bot challenge, thoughts?
 reCurse: Don't
 BlaiseEbuth: ^^
 KalamariKing: Wow alright
 Westicles: You want to jump from clash to NN bots?
 KalamariKing: I've been doing nns for a while now... I do clashes just because I only have small blocks of time scattered throughout the day
 KalamariKing: plus it helps to (imo) challenge critical thinking on-the-fly
 Westicles: Oh, I keep getting you mixed up with that guy who just turned 16.  Sorry
 KalamariKing: who?
 Westicles: The other king guy?
 KalamariKing: King_Coda?
 KalamariKing: he does clashes? I never knew this
 KalamariKing: now I wanna beat him and prove who's the better king
 KalamariKing: regardless, what games *would* you suggest for nns
 reCurse: uttt is the worst by a few orders of magnitude
 reCurse: Then you got the rest, take your pick
 reCurse: Oware is easy
 reCurse: Breakthrough is more fun
 reCurse: imo
 Westicles: Beats me.  There are like 10 guys on here doing NN on CG, and the best ones are already talking to you
 Westicles: The optims are nice to try first since you can do them offline first and not get hung up on 100ms time limits
 KalamariKing: Alr, thanks... lemme check a few out
 KalamariKing: Why IS uttt a poor choice tho?
 reCurse: Imagine debugging a game where mostly no one knows what's a good position
 MSmits: you might consider this problematic in oware also
 KalamariKing: Specifically games good for nns, I've had my go at search algos and don't like them
 MSmits: and i am not sure if oware is that easy. Some rules are annoying to sim
 reCurse: Uh?
 MSmits: like, if a move does not leave seeds for opponent its not allowed
 reCurse: Oware actually has real people playing competitively
 MSmits: no i mean the complexity of the game, it's deceptive because of the weird rules
 MSmits: seems simpler than it is
 MSmits: uttt sim is simpler
 reCurse: I disagree
 reCurse: Oware sim is amongst my shortest sim codes
 MSmits: weird, mine is very long&#160;:)
 MSmits: i guess it's because of the weird bitboard stuff
 MSmits: but uttt is a really simple loop over available squares
 MSmits: then check for 3 in a row
 reCurse: Anyway I don't think sim complexity is much a factor here
 MSmits: also, uttt also has real people playing competitively. The game is just unbalanced
 reCurse:&#160;???
 MSmits: p1 win&#160;%
 MSmits: it's too much 
 reCurse: More than 10 weird people across the internet? There's actual roots for oware
 MSmits: oware doesnt have that
 MSmits: ohhh you mean outside of CG
 MSmits: sorry misunderstood
 reCurse: Yes because my point was about the understanding of the game
 reCurse: Oware is well studied
 RoboStac: he said real people, of course he meant outside of cg
 MSmits: sure yes, but there are many versions of this game outside of CG and they are all different from our version
 Nzk: yay codingame working? :D
 reCurse: lol Robostac
 MSmits: hehe
 reCurse: Real people as opposed to bots sorry :P
 MSmits: got it
 reCurse: Versions are close enough to be relevant
 reCurse: Opening strategies seemed similar enough anyway
 MSmits: but isn't your aversion to uttt mostly because of the huge amount of draws, which gets worse near the top when p1 almost always wins
 reCurse: I have tons of aversions to uttt
 reCurse: My biggest one is it's unreadable
 MSmits: i dont think its more unreadable than oware. Not to me
 MSmits: but thats personal, maybe i have been staring at uttt too much
 reCurse: Uh, I don't get that at all
 reCurse: Oware is easily 10x more readable
 MSmits: well it's just the score thats readable, more points = better. But other than that, all i can see is that i can do a capture next trun
 MSmits: turn
 MSmits: looking more than 1 turn ahead is impossible for me in oware
 reCurse: The moves are constant
 reCurse: You can formulate a win condition
 reCurse: etc
 reCurse: There's a lot more opaqueness in uttt, a lot of it is due to the next board
 MSmits: well i can consider moves and look 2-3 turns ahead in uttt, i cant do it in oware. the seed thing makes my head hurt
 MSmits: 2-3 plies i mean
 MSmits: sure uttt is not very readable, a lot less than breakthrough
 MSmits: I also find othello to be very unreadable btw
 MSmits: probably also personal
 reCurse: UTTT --------------------------- Oware, Othello ------ Breakthrough
 reCurse: First line is not to scale
 struct: oh god <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://i.imgur.com/EmBnQ0F.jpeg">https://i.imgur.com/EmBnQ0F.jpeg</a>
 MSmits: lol ok
 struct:&#160;:(
 MSmits: well what did you expect struct :P
 KalamariKing: struct oh no
 reCurse: struct you should use radial
 struct: ill try it thanks
 reCurse: I'm not saying it will help
 struct: I was trying graph js 
 reCurse: But it will look nicer
 reCurse: :P
 struct: its a bit slow
 reCurse: If you want pure fun and no usefulness
 reCurse: Try vivagraph
 reCurse: Force-directed graph madness
 reCurse: It's very cool
 reCurse: Wasted a few hours with it
 MSmits: I made this for hexapawn: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://trinket.io/python/70a9b9ef2a?outputOnly=true">https://trinket.io/python/70a9b9ef2a?outputOnly=true</a>
 MSmits: can walk through tree with arrows
 MSmits: and solve with spacebar
 MSmits: solving whole game takes a few minutes 
 MSmits: embedded this in our teaching environment as an extra assignment if they have nothing else left to do 
 reCurse: Cool
 MSmits: It seems a lot harder to make use of a graph visualization in a meaningful way, than actually visualizing it
 MSmits: trees get so big so fast
 PatrickMcGinnisII: finally array_splice($this-&gt;avoid,array_search($house1,$this-&gt;avoid),1);
 PatrickMcGinnisII: oops

 MSmits: PatrickMcGinnisIl be careful you dont share an entire bot this way :P
 MSmits: I have accidentally pasted a bot in the little chat window before, but caught myself
 PatrickMcGinnisII: lol, I'd give U whatever bot I have... if the code is clean ... but I leave 'em kinda dirty. heh
 MSmits: problem is they can just paste them in the IDE and run a copy 
 MSmits: it's more problematic if it is a top 10 bot ofcourse
 KalamariKing: How far into the connect 4 challenge to I have to get to complete the weekly challenge
 MSmits: i think just wood 1
 MSmits: so just a few if else should do it
 MSmits: or a simple minimax
 Azhy: hi, what does mean minimax
 MSmits: search algorithm to find the best move, assuming your opponent plays perfectly
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google minmax
 MSmits: btw, for a few weeks I had to replace a sick colleague and played yavalath with some students
 struct: did any of them win vs you?
 King_Coda: Azhy <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://lmgtfy.app/?q=minimax+algorithm&amp;iie=1">https://lmgtfy.app/?q=minimax+algorithm&amp;iie=1</a>
 MSmits: I've gotten much better as a player and always beat them, so i gave them a link to my online version and last week got a message they beat it on the highest level, so they kept playing at home :P
 struct: nice
 MSmits: yeah it's cool
 MSmits: it's really a fun board game to wase a few minutes with
 MSmits: waste
 struct: very simple rules
 MSmits: yeah
 Azhy: what about this weeks challenge
 MSmits: connect 4
 Azhy: yep
 MSmits: also a fun game I suppose
 Azhy: i got 72 rank
 Azhy: yeh
 MSmits: I prefer yavalath though, it's more complex and harder to solve
 MSmits: also it can end early
 Azhy: i dont know nothing about that
 MSmits: well i suppose C4 can also
 reCurse: I get the impression maybe Hex is more fun, could be wrong
 MSmits: hmm maybe, i havent played it
 MSmits: Astrobytes has i think
 Azhy: good game
 Azhy: i may try
 MSmits: yavalath is good until you become too good at it. Then its just a matter of filling the board efficiently and thats boring
 MSmits: this happens in C4 as well
 Azhy: yeh this is the problem of bot programming
 MSmits: sooner even, it's easy to avoid stupid mistakes, but when the board fills up, at some point you canrt
 Azhy: yep
 MSmits: well i guess it's not that strange that both games have the same issue as they have the same win condition&#160;:)
 Azhy: did u try to solve the tree challenge
 MSmits: nope, whats that?
 Azhy: growing trees and getting points to win
 King_Coda: I think they mean the spring 2021 challenge
 KalamariKing: King_Coda!
 Azhy: yep
 MSmits: ohh ok, yes i was in the contest
 King_Coda: KalamariKing!
 MSmits: got low legend as the end result
 Azhy: how were  u
 KalamariKing: I think it was reCurse but someone mixed us up
 Azhy: great
 MSmits: yeah, i was glad to get past gold boss
 Azhy: its too boring when you begin
 Azhy: it has too much considerations
 KalamariKing: the connect 4 boss actually plays the game
 KalamariKing: everyone in wood 1 just places a column
 IvesL: cuz it only has wood leagues?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: ok gonna submit this monstrosity
 KalamariKing: the simplest strat I could think of is getting pretty good lol
 KalamariKing: its literally just keep pillaring until opp has 3 in a row, then block, then keep pillaring
 KalamariKing: HOW IS THIS TOP 20
 jrke: kalamkariking top 20 is not too easy i am having depth 6 minimax bot not sure if i am having good eval and i am ranked 28th
 KalamariKing: I'm in wood 2
 KalamariKing: but still, top 3 with literally one line of actual logic
 jrke: here is why you lose
 jrke: turn 20
 jrke: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/561943484">https://www.codingame.com/share-replay/561943484</a>
 jrke: you didn't blocked that
 KalamariKing: I'm not checking for blocking anything or catching a possible win. Its literally printing the opponent's last move if the turn index is 5 or 6, otherwise pillar on 7
 KalamariKing: except for the boss I'm #1 someone, please, help this leage
 struct: wow react updates on change?
 KalamariKing: I kinda wanna build a nn for this... if someone wants to either explain here or in dms, could someone explain how nns are ported to cg
 KalamariKing: struct react.js?
 struct: yes
 KalamariKing: it's called... react... I think its... reacting... to a state change
 King_Coda: :rofl:
 jrke: kalamkariKing you save weights and add those in your code manually
 KalamariKing: right but how
 KalamariKing: just save it as text and copy-paste into a large string, then decode that as numbers again?
 jrke: zipping libs
 KalamariKing: which would you suggest
 jrke: i haven't tried NN yet so not sure
 jrke: maybe try pickle
 KalamariKing: alr, thanks
 StevensGino: I am trying to have high rank on Mars lander, any suggestion?
 StevensGino: for optimize problem
 PatrickMcGinnisII: You've made it to the next league
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 94% winrate
 YoloTheBear: Why does the connect 4 only give 100ms&#160;:( If I could get like 250 ms my bot would be insane
 IvesL: cuz it doesnt want you to go insane
 IvesL: mental health care
 ja_fica: So would the enemy bots xD
 YoloTheBear: How are you supposed to recursively search a 2d array for the next possible moves and check for rows, columns, and both diagnals in 100 ms. I can go only search 3 moves out and it's not enough I need at least 4, 8 would be best
 ja_fica: It should be 100ms to speed up the ranking system, its more fair
 ja_fica: binary
 ja_fica: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://blog.gamesolver.org/">http://blog.gamesolver.org/</a>
 ja_fica: bit board section
 ja_fica: you can check 1 000 000 plays in 100ms
 ja_fica: more than*7
 YoloTheBear: Ohh thanks that looks interesting
 YoloTheBear: Dang that article has a lot of good stuff
 ja_fica: yes it does, it has some back efficient code that you can addapt for 9x7, remenber that 9x7 is perfect because it is less than 64
 ja_fica: you can check if a move is a win by comparing all integer possibilities of win in that position, it is around 60, checking 60 integers takes 180 clock cycles or only 2 if you store in an array of precomputed booleans
 Bob23: hmmmm
 ja_fica: It is not easy to implement but it is worth if you can avoid cache misses
 StevensGino: connect4 has now more than 200 player
 StevensGino: greate
 ja_fica: You store all integers (64 bit) possibilities that contain that row and col  
 PatrickMcGinnisII: 92% winrate You've made it to the next league.You can now ADD and REMOVE paths! 
 MSmits: gj PatrickMcGinnisII
 MSmits: ja_fica if you're creative with simd, fastest is to do winchecking without array lookups
 ja_fica: 63 arrays of row/col combinations, each array with 16 (I think is the maximun combinations that fit a position)
 MSmits: you can check in 4 directions simultaneously
 MSmits: we have 256 bit registers that fit the gamestate 4 times
 MSmits: for 1 player anyway
 ja_fica: does coding game have AVX for 512?
 MSmits: but if you've never done avx/simd then those lookups you mention are a good alternative
 MSmits: no it doesnt
 struct: no
 Lucky30_: guys i found a job

 King_Coda: I hate being stuck in wood 2 league. It's filled with a bunch of people who just submitted blank code. there' no challenge
 PatrickMcGinnisII: wood2 in TAC is like gold, but it says bronze
 Nzk: lol king
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i guess cause full rules are considered bronze
 Nzk: im in wood 1 connect now :0
 King_Coda: I'm serious, things don't get real until silver league

 King_Coda: That's my opinion^
 PatrickMcGinnisII: depends on game, some games don't get alot of 'action' and even 'random' bots can give u a challenge in some games
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i'm 93rd in connect3 with a depth2 bot, every1 should be above me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: er 4
 King_Coda: Connect 3... isn't that just bejeweled?
 King_Coda: Or candy crush
 Nzk: lol
 Nzk: PatrickMcGinnisll im 80 with a detect if its i can connect 4 bot
 Nzk: also prevent opp connect 4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: and i just found a bug
 Nzk: lol
 Nzk: im tryna do prevent falling into a trap
 jacek: you made bot for connect3?
 Nzk: nope 4
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i said "er 4".. typo
 PatrickMcGinnisII: so with a buggy depth2 bot at 93rd everyone should definetely be above me
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i still can't spell
 PatrickMcGinnisII: not gonna fix it, glhf 
 Nzk: lol
 Nzk: my code is buggy me out
 Bob23: Hello World!
 Nzk: hello
 Nzk: bruh now my map is upside down for no reason
 KalamariKing: maybe its upside down because you made it upside down
 Nzk: lmao
 derjack: :upside_down:
 Nzk: hhh out of bounds exception
 King_Coda: Bronze league always runs the slowest and I dont know why
 Nzk: hm
 King_Coda: It has nothing to do with the amount of people, it's just the battles themselves are so slow
 KalamariKing: Could be the sheer amount of people
 KalamariKing: A decent amount get out of wood and then just leave it; their bots are still in circulation though
 King_Coda: "It has nothing to do with the amount of people"
 King_Coda: :thinking:
 KalamariKing: "its just the battles themselves are so slow"
 KalamariKing: more people == more battles == more time

 StevensGino: of course I know how to search on GG
 King_Coda: Okay, I recommend Eclipse then
 King_Coda: It's sold as a Java IDE, but it's also one of the best for C++
 StevensGino: thank you
 struct: vscode or vs for c++
 PatrickMcGinnisII: VStudio, I use Eclipse for Java, but IntelliJ is good for java
 StevensGino: thank you guys
 King_Coda: Oh, I FORGOT about Visual Studio
 King_Coda: Yes, def use VS
 1rre: Eh, VSCode is more than enough for Java/other JVM languages if you're doing it yourself, however it can be fiddly to transfer code from idea/eclipse to itI've had super bad experiences with Eclipse (it runs at a crawl with a 5900x &amp; 32gb of ram) but I've only used older versions of it &amp; only with cross compiling C so I'd probably recommend VS (although VSCode is enough for me, the debugging is VS is just better)
 King_Coda: WOAH
 King_Coda: Big message
 1rre: chonk
 King_Coda: You have a 5900x?

 MSmits: think a contest arrived and didnt go back or something
 struct: let me see
 MSmits: or someone made yavalath or whatnot
 Astrobytes: Hmm, no it was for something else iirc
 MSmits: i also  had a tron bitboard floodfill thingy
 MSmits: but never checked how it compares to other methods
 MSmits: and that bot was bad too, never got out of gold
 Astrobytes: Could have been that. I am not sure.
 emh: on my desktop I get 1.8M floodfills
 MSmits: could get depth 17 ab pruning or something
 MSmits: still no legend :P
 struct: I remember that locally i had over 1.2mill
 struct: on ide*
 emh: and by floodfill, do you mean the component starting at one index, or all indicies? for one color? or all colors?
 MSmits: then we just established your PC is crap struct :P
 struct: 1 floodfill = 1 color
 Astrobytes: I think one fill from one index and from one colour
 emh: ok. I defined floodfill to be for all indicies and for one color
 struct: yeah that
 struct: what astro said
 emh: ok so we are comparing apples and apples then&#160;:)
 struct: index+color
 emh: ohh
 emh: the apples and oranges
 emh: let me see how filled my test board was
 Astrobytes: brb
 emh: ~1.8M was for a board with 11 indices
 reCurse: More importantly though, did you come up with nice alternative themes for stc?
 Astrobytes: hahaha
 Astrobytes: God help us all
 MSmits: I shudder to think what would come falling down
 emh: hahahah
 AntiSquid: i can give you an idea
 emh: I do have a theme, but it's just some circles in a grid hehe
 MSmits: no need AntiSquid, we can all imagine :P
 emh: I started using repl.it and dropped a http server in the C++ to show some JSON on a web page
 MSmits: ohh repl.it, we used this for teaching for a while
 MSmits: until they started asking more money
 emh: oh I am just using the free
 AntiSquid: emh imagine mannequins that you can rotate like in tetris and you drop them on one another . not saying more, you are bright enough to figure it out
 MSmits: yeah the free is fine
 MSmits: google collab puzzles me btw
 emh: AntiSquid hehe
 MSmits: is this one of those things that starts free untill many use it and then it stops being free?
 AntiSquid: is youtube free&#160;?
 MSmits: they offer free use of gpu and tpu, just not guaranteed when you want them
 MSmits: no, but this is hard calculation time
 emh: ok doing a checker pattern on the grid, that is, 36 indices out of 72, drops local perf from 1.8M to 800k. so that's worst case I guess
 MSmits: expensive
 AntiSquid: probably might have to pay at some point for going past a limit&#160;?
 MSmits: no idea, i was just wondering if anyone here knew
 AntiSquid: they restricted inbox + google drive max free size
 MSmits: google drive is driving me nuts
 MSmits: maybe i should just pay
 Astrobytes: Slave to the capitalists! Repent!
 MSmits: :grin:
 AntiSquid: so what have you been doing anything interesting on collab?
 MSmits: no, i have just been considering it. Two separate colleague teachers sent me mails suggesting it
 MSmits: for teaching ML
 emh: I paid for google space. gdrive. 100 gig
 MSmits: but i think because they dont guarantee timely use, its not useful for live teaching
 AntiSquid: i tend to setup locally, find collab somewhat confusing when it comes to installing stuff i need, sometimes it just stops working ....
 Astrobytes: Oh they just use what's available at the time then
 MSmits: yeah
 MSmits: supposedly installing is easier than doing it with jupyter locally
 Astrobytes: Anything in your teaching budget for that? Assuming they have an 'academic' package
 MSmits: we have a budget, sure. But any big expenditures have to be answered for of course
 MSmits: have to be able to show we're using it a lot
 Astrobytes: Most things are easier/nicer than Jupyter in my experience (imo)
 AntiSquid: MSmits should have benefits like free access to papers, wonder what other benefits he has.
 Astrobytes: Hm. Get robots and make them do things. Should impress the board.
 MSmits: hmm not sure if i have full free access, it's not a university
 MSmits: actually i am a student for a little while yet
 MSmits: so currently yeah
 AntiSquid: download all papers
 MSmits: lol
 MSmits: full server dump
 AntiSquid: dutch Aaron Swartz
 MSmits: just read his wiki, sad story, died young
 Astrobytes: You never heard of him previously?
 MSmits: nopw
 MSmits: I often live under a rock
 Astrobytes: I do too but mostly it's pop culture I miss 
 MSmits: I have a bigger rock
 Astrobytes: Rock on Smitty
 MSmits: :grin:
 MSmits: allright thats it for today, gn, hf, dont kick me off nr 1 or I am getting my grimoire
 AntiSquid: idk maybe i invest too much time reading those kind of stories
 AntiSquid: gn8 smits
 Astrobytes: lol gn dude
 emh: gn smits
 struct: the entire tree is 5mb...
 struct: tab using 3gb of ram
 struct: rip
 emh: struct what tree?
 Astrobytes: :rofl:
 struct: mcts tree
 struct: for normal ttt
 struct: with solver
 emh: ohh so not StC
 Astrobytes: Don't get him back on STC again emh we'll never see him again
 emh: hehe. btw I added an easy optimization: skip empty rows. now getting 3-4M locally
 emh: for board filled with 10-20
 emh: should verify it's correct before I share anything. maybe I'll write another tech.io article
 qlorg: Hi
 Astrobytes: Go for it man. Knowledge is power. I like it when people use tech.io for useful CG stuff, it makes the chat a lot more manageable when you can just link something :D
 emh: yes. thank you&#160;:)
 Astrobytes: Anyway, see you all later. Goodnight/day 
 struct: gn
 emh: gn Astrobytes
 emh: struct do you use some technique for flood fill other than standard?
 struct: no
 struct: I guess its not standard
 emh: ohh. using bitboards? or something else?
 struct: nah
 struct: i use int8
 struct: I store the cells in array and check if i already visited them
 struct: The cells that need checking
 struct: then i check in all directions
 emh: ohh so it's pretty normal then I guess. wondered if you made some special tweaks to get so good perf
 emh: I just love fiddling with bits hehe
 1rre: If you like fiddling with bits take a look at erlang's bitstring
 1rre: I made a stack based low level interpreter in it when I was writing my C compiler &amp; good god those are good bits to fiddle with
 emh: hehe I don't know erlang
 emh: wow.. looks a bit arcane&#160;:)
 emh: ok I got the point you are just concatenating bit strings?
 1rre: kinda
 emh: and it's self referential* and with When clauses, hmm
 emh: but no erlang on CG it seems
 emh: phew.. so don't need to learn it hehe
 1rre: yes it's the biggest travesty of all time
 1rre: it's really cool seeing how the stack works though, eg when calling this function: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a913238-a1d5-487c-8eb3-faccfd05ec2a">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/6a913238-a1d5-487c-8eb3-faccfd05ec2a</a>
 1rre: the output is:[{function,{0,i,32}, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b88a3df-3041-482e-90d3-643b240b822e">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/0b88a3df-3041-482e-90d3-643b240b822e</a>
 1rre: oi you messed up my IR syntax
 1rre: [{function,{0,i,32}, <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/49480337-9cf2-42e0-9ab2-62653ab9a58b">http://chat.codingame.com/pastebin/49480337-9cf2-42e0-9ab2-62653ab9a58b</a>
 1rre: great it just doesn't like it lol
 emh: ok. is it related to cellular automata or something? bit patterns evolving?
 emh: I didn't understand it well, just glanced at it :p
 1rre: Nah it's an interpreter
 emh: ok. might look into it some day
 1rre: but also a stack simulator because why not both
 1rre: Isn't a CPU technically a machine code interpreter though?Thought for the dayt
 emh: yeah I guess it is
 Dark_Lover: hi
 emh: good night everyone
 moez: hi
 PatrickMcGinnisII: boss is nutz!  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/replay/562029125">https://www.codingame.com/replay/562029125</a>
 Wontonimo: why you say nutz? looks like you killed it.  How hard was it?
 Wontonimo: It's interesting that at first it says "Struct" then changes to "Boss 3".  I wonder if that is a glitch or if Structs bot is Boss 3?
 PatrickMcGinnisII: The game is crazy, had to change startegy a bit to kill boss
 PatrickMcGinnisII: trying to control 50 units was timing me out all over the place
 PatrickMcGinnisII: struct vs. euler was the demo game, i think that's why their names pop up on replay
 Wontonimo: yeah, so how do you control so many agents? 
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i optimize the triangle captures by creating a distance-to matrix on turn 0.  do 3 units, rinse and repeat up to 20 units...then i take the rest and try to anticipate where enemies will be to either block captures or kill them
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the total number of houses /2 is a good startpoint for the number of units I need to have doing triangle captures
 PatrickMcGinnisII: i could do more in a faster lang
 PatrickMcGinnisII: fer sure
 8385: hi i joined right now
 8385: :disappointed:
 8385: @kettle_with_hackintosh I need help
 kettle_with_hackintosh:&#160;?
 8385: I don't know how to code
 kettle_with_hackintosh: learn then :P
 8385: hmm........
 MACKEYTH: Python is a good place to start
 8385: ok
 8385: I did go
 Stormalix: ooof
 Stormalix: imo javascript is a good language to start with
 8385: a program language
 Stormalix: but more people i see here know python so it might be best choise
 Stormalix: choice
 kettle_with_hackintosh: any popular high-level language is decent for starting imo
 MACKEYTH: Also very popular.
 8385: javascript is a high programing language
 8385: high level
 Stormalix: if you're looking into coding imo codingame is kind of for more experienced people, i learned basic javascript and some HTML from khan academy
 Wontonimo: the best programming language is
 8385: javascript or python?
 Wontonimo: the one you use
 Husoski: Anything but C or C++ for a first language, I'd say.  
 Stormalix: ^^^
 8385: I know html
 Wontonimo: html isn't
 8385: only a few of it
 Eltrion: I'd say python over Javascript as javascript lets you get away with some bad habits.
 Stormalix: true lol
 8385: so python?
 Eltrion: It's a great starting language.
 Stormalix: python requires u to indent code or something which i find mildy irritating
 Wontonimo: c is FANTASTIC to get to know the actual computer and its limits.  It is a very small language at the core
 Husoski: If you know some html, then take a look at JavaScript.  Khan Academy videos teach that.
 Eltrion: Yeah, but you should indent your code anyway.
 Husoski: C is a great 2nd or third language.
 Stormalix: Khan Academy was very helpful for me
 Wontonimo: ^^
 Wontonimo: if you haven't already, go there
 8385: I heard about khan academy
 Wontonimo: also, have fun.  There is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>  which is fun and turing complete.  It doesn't look like a "legit language", but you'll have fun and do more
 8385: what clash are you doing next
 8385: i have been there many times
 8385: i code minecraft on scratch
 8385: block is easy for me so i use scratch
 8385: go to <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://w3schools.com">http://w3schools.com</a>
 8385: that is were i learn html
 PatrickMcGinnisII: Truthfully, pascal is the best 1st language for learning.  Then C,C++,C#.  Unless you are young as hell, then maybe starting with Lisp would be appropriate.  I learned Basic -&gt; ASM -&gt; Pascal -&gt; Fortran -&gt; C -&gt; C++ -&gt; Java and all the scripting languages in-between
 kettle_with_hackintosh: asm second language?
 kettle_with_hackintosh: tough times xd
 PatrickMcGinnisII: the variety of includes and libs can be really daunting imo for a newb.  The string operations of C are NOT friendly for a starter, nor the object pointers.  PY could be a good choice for the next gen, but imo it's sloppy
 PatrickMcGinnisII: I was doing ML b4 DOS
 kettle_with_hackintosh: oh
 bitbitthebunny: Hi all, i'm new joiner, total beginner, trying to learn new language. Kinda confused with the wording to use and stuck, is there a source to learn basic in here?
 Eltrion: ML is not that hard, especially if you chunk it into small pieces. The problem is that it takes so long before you can do much interesting.
 bitbitthebunny: i used to read a little bit of Python, do you recommend it for a beginner like me or there's other more friendly language?
 Eltrion: Depends what you want to learn. Python isn't a bad choice.
 PatrickMcGinnisII: google is your friend... try geeksforgeeks.com, interpreting example source code beyond cut/paste is how u learn
 modo_doggo: i think Python is a good start
 Wontonimo: hey bitbitthebunny, this site isn't the best place for total noobs.  If you can write some logic, loops, and know about arrays, then stick around
 kettle_with_hackintosh: btw i started with pascal but still dunno, why people like to say it's best language to start with
 PatrickMcGinnisII: easy puzzles are a great place to write real code without having to make-up your own desired project
 bitbitthebunny: Hi Wontonimo, I was trying to solve the Descent, understand what's going on but i guess the wording is not correct and stuck.
 bitbitthebunny: Saw someone of the website you guys recommended above, looking into in now. Thanks guys!
 PatrickMcGinnisII: kettle_with_hackintosh I think it is because you don't have to have any overhead understanding to jump into understanding functions
 Wontonimo: bitbitthebunny try <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1">https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/mars-lander-episode-1</a>&#160;!  it's fun.  Turn off your sound though
 bitbitthebunny: WontonimoOkay let me try.
 Wontonimo: it you like it, there are a few more of that theme with increasing difficulty ... like a steep increase
 Wontonimo: bitbitthebunny, for the-descent the goal is stated at the top&#160;: "shoot the highest mountain on your path."
 Wontonimo: that's it.  it really isn't anything more than finding the index of the highest mountain and returning it
 Bob23: hello
 Bob23: Screw Finals! Whos with me?
 modo_doggo: why not
 Wontonimo: yeah, i'm not going to study for finals this term
 Wontonimo: mind you, it's been over 2 decades since I wrote my last one
 Zero23: hi
 modo_doggo: hi
 StevensGino: hi
 StevensGino: too silent
 Bob23: always
 StevensGino: not really, some time the box is very active
 IvesL: you can talk to Automaton2000, isnt it
 Automaton2000: i don't see why my code isnt working
 StevensGino: haha

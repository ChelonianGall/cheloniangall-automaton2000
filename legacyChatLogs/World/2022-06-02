 iydbhkz: I just joined,is there someone who can teach me how to use it
 antiwonto: [auto] hey iydbhkz looking for some intro tutorials on programming?  This isn't the place probably.  Try codecademy.com , 'The Coding Train' on youtube, or first levels in codewars.com
 iydbhkz: thanks

 RandomSteve: oh boy I tought the red letters were a warning that scared me

 RandomSteve: wow
 RandomSteve: doesn0t work for me xd
 RandomSteve: anyway
 5DN1L: I can see it in red text
 5DN1L: only the one who's mentioned sees it in red
 RandomSteve: if you wanna learn some very very basic java stuff feel free to message em directly
 RandomSteve: oh I understand now

 elie.f.asmar: exactly!!
 5DN1L: never switched back since then, it seems
 elie.f.asmar: Can we sign like a petition or something to switch it back to the original state?

 5DN1L: elie.f.asmar yes, discussing coding-related things
 elie.f.asmar: So within a month we will be switching to discord, right?
 5DN1L: discord is in service already

 5DN1L: np
 PatrickMcGinnisII: only thing about discord is the chat history, alot of valuable info if u got the patience to search it.
 5DN1L: and much less spam
 5DN1L: less need for moderation
 elie.f.asmar: less need for moderation? 
 5DN1L: mods don't have to constantly kick or ban people there
 5DN1L: only do it once in a while
 elie.f.asmar: So technically, chat rooms are full of trolls 
 Frankich: Well students (which are the most spammer around here) does not using discord much (or at least does not bother to create account just for that)
 nicola: Here, yes.
 nicola: On Discord, no.
 jaime_les_microbites: lol, the chat will be deleted because of your abusive behaviours 5DN1L
 elie.f.asmar: Okay noted.
 nicola: The chan will be deleted because of immature trolls.

 Harry12302: Heyyy
 kylan_aime_mindhi: how are you
 kylan_aime_mindhi: are you single&#160;?
 Harry12302: Great, you?
 jacek: whats the question
 Leeward: I sometimes get notifications about comments on my contributions, but then there's nothing new. Does that mean the comment was deleted?
 jacek: probably
 5DN1L: or maybe the comment was edited? i'm not sure
 yoyowong: how to code
 yoyowong: i am a newbie
 yoyowong: :stuck_out_tongue:
 5DN1L: if you haven't learned any programming languages before, it's better for you to learn it on another website first
 Leeward: I just had a closer look and figured it out... the comment was part of a collapsed section. Would be nice if clicking the notification automatically un-collapsed it and/or highlighted the relevant comment. I mean it's already in the URL params.
 5DN1L: yeah, that happens
 Sacrifyt: is there a way to pick a level of dificulty?
 5DN1L: for puzzles, yes, for clashes, no

 Wontonimo: there are a lot of variations, and i don't want to do it by hand.
 Wontonimo: but yes, i could filter 99% of them
 Wontonimo: also looking for the keywords 'kicked' and 'banned' will help me find relative locations for poor behaviour.  heck, i could turn it into a whole machine learning activity to find all the bad behaviour

 Ayza: If it was the easiest I would have learned it already
 Ayza: I lose motivation everytime I look at it's syntax lol
 jacek: bashing their dreams of being programmer
 Wontonimo: QuackyCodes , don't use bash to learn to program.  That's just mental abuse.  Try python or javascript
 DadoMkd: i want code with java
